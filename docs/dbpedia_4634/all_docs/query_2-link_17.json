The Return of Son Goku\" / \"Prologue to Battle! The Return of Goku!\"[16]\n\nTransliteration: \"Tatakai no Makuake! Kaette Kita zo Son Gokū\" (Japanese: 闘いの幕開け! 帰ってきたぞ孫悟空)DBZ SP1 & 1–2AApril 5, 2009 ( )May 24, 2010\n\nThe series begins with a flashback of the destruction of Planet Vegeta at the hands of Frieza, and the upbringing of Goku on Earth as depicted in the original Dragon Ball series. Five years have passed since Goku's victory over Piccolo at the 23rd World Martial Arts Tournament, and he has since married Chi-Chi and now has a son named Gohan. Goku and Gohan are heading towards a reunion with Goku's friends at Master Roshi's island. Elsewhere, an odd-looking spacecraft crash lands on Earth. A man in battle armor emerges from the vessel and flies off to scout out a powerful life form he locates with the help of an apparatus on his eye. Piccolo is nearly killed by the stranger, but this is averted when the man leaves to scout out a more powerful life form. The other strong life form is Goku, who at the Kame House presents his son to Roshi, Krillin, and Bulma. The stranger arrives and surprises everyone when they notice he has a monkey-like tail, just like Goku used to have.\n\n22\"The Enemy is Goku's Brother?! The Secret of the Mighty Saiyan Warriors!\"[16]\n\nTransliteration: \"Teki wa Gokū no Ani!? Saikyō Senshi Saiyajin no Himitsu\" (Japanese: 敵は悟空の兄!? 最強戦士サイヤ人の秘密)2B–3April 12, 2009 ( )May 24, 2010\n\nThe stranger says that his name is Raditz, and that he is Goku's older brother. Goku cannot remember this, as he had suffered from brain damage caused by a fall when he was a child. Raditz reports that he and Goku are of an alien race called the Saiyans from a planet called Vegeta and that he and Goku are among the last four remaining. Raditz then asks Goku to join them in exterminating the population of Earth, taking Gohan hostage when Goku refuses. Piccolo appears and offers to help Goku defeat Raditz; Goku accepts his offer and together they follow after Raditz. Goku and Piccolo confront the Saiyan at his space pod's crash site, but Raditz is not impressed and tells them that the other two remaining Saiyans are even stronger than he is.\n\n33\"Life or Death Battle! Goku and Piccolo's Fierce Suicidal Attack\" / \"A Life or Death Battle! Goku and Piccolo's Desperate Attack!\"[16]\n\nTransliteration: \"Inochi o Kaketa Tatakai! Gokū to Pikkoro Sutemi no Mōkō\" (Japanese: 命をかけた闘い! 悟空とピッコロ捨て身の猛攻)4–5April 19, 2009 ( )May 25, 2010\n\nGoku and Piccolo are no match for Raditz in direct conflict, so they decide to have Goku distract Raditz while Piccolo gathers energy for an attack strong enough to defeat Raditz. This plan fails, as does Goku's attempt to stop Raditz by grabbing his tail ends when Goku gets tricked by his brother. Raditz tortures Goku, causing Gohan to unleash his latent abilities in a fit of rage, and he strikes Raditz in the chest. Goku uses this opportunity to grab Raditz from behind, allowing Piccolo to use his Makankosappo (Special Beam Cannon) technique on Raditz - killing them both. Before he succumbs to his wound, Raditz tells his enemies that the other Saiyans will arrive on Earth within a year. Bulma, Krillin, and Master Roshi arrive to witness Goku's death.\n\n44\"Son Goku Runs in the Afterlife! The Million Kilometer Serpent Road\" / \"Run in the Afterlife, Goku! The One Million Mile Snake Way!\"[16]\n\nTransliteration: \"Anoyo de Hashire Son Gokū! Hyaku-man Kiro no Hebi no Michi\" (Japanese: あの世で走れ孫悟空! 100万キロの蛇の道)6 & 7BApril 26, 2009 ( )May 25, 2010\n\nKami takes Goku along with his body to the Other World. Bulma takes Raditz's scouter in order to repair it and find Yamcha, Tien Shinhan, and Chiaotzu. Piccolo takes Gohan into his custody and flies off, intending to train the boy in preparation for the two Saiyans' arrival. In Other World, Kami arranges for Goku to be allowed to travel to King Kai via the million-mile-long Snake Way; King Kai will then train Goku in advanced fighting techniques, in hopes that by the time he is re-animated Goku will be strong enough to face the new Saiyans who are heading towards Earth. While Goku starts his journey along the long road, Krillin unsuccessfully attempts to tell Chi-Chi of her husband's death and her son's kidnapping. Meanwhile, Piccolo tells Gohan of his father's fate. Gohan doubts that he has any significant intrinsic power, so Piccolo uses a dramatic method to demonstrate Gohan's hidden power - he throws Gohan at a rock, which Gohan destroys reflexively.\n\n55\"Wilderness Survival! A Moonlit Night Awakens Gohan!\"[16]\n\nTransliteration: \"Kōya no Sabaibaru! Tsukiyo ga Gohan o Yobisamasu\" (Japanese: 荒野のサバイバル! 月夜が悟飯を呼び覚ます)7–8May 3, 2009 ( )May 26, 2010\n\nGohan's survival training begins. After a length of time spent alone on a mountaintop, Gohan looks at the full moon, which causes him to transform into a Saiyan \"Great Ape.\" Rather than let him rampage unchecked, Piccolo destroys the moon, making any further transformations impossible for both Gohan and the other Saiyans, and removes Gohan's Saiyan tail, before leaving to begin his own training. Meanwhile, Bulma repairs the scouter, and Yajirobe delivers a summons to Krillin, telling him that the two of them, along with Yamcha, Tien, and Chiaotzu, are to report to Kami's Lookout for training.\n\n66\"Finally Arriving at the End! Kaio-sama's Playful Test\" / \"The End of Snake Way! King Kai's Bizarre Test!\"[16]\n\nTransliteration: \"Tadori Tsuita Shūten!

Piccolo then begins training the boy personally in martial arts. Meanwhile, Goku has arrived at the end of Snake Way, meeting King Kai on his planet, which, despite its small size, has ten-times Earth's gravity. In order for Goku to train under King Kai's teachings, he must attempt to make the master laugh. After Goku's accomplishment of making him laugh, King Kai tells Goku to catch his pet monkey, Bubbles. This proves to be a difficult task for Goku due to the planet's intense gravity, but he is persistent and refuses to give up.\n\n77\"Battle with 10-Fold Gravity! Goku, Your Training is a Footrace\" / \"The Battle with Ten-Times Gravity! Goku's Race Against the Clock!\"[16]\n\nTransliteration: \"Jū-bai Jūryoku to Tatakae! Gokū yo Shugyō wa Kakekko da\" (Japanese: 10倍重力と闘え! 悟空よ修行はかけっこだ)19B–20May 17, 2009 ( )May 27, 2010\n\nAfter three weeks, Goku succeeds in catching Bubbles. He is then issued his second challenge, to hit Gregory, the flying grasshopper, with a large mallet. After two weeks of trying, Goku succeeds and fully masters the planet's gravity in the process. King Kai then proceeds to teach Goku his signature technique: the Kaio-ken. On Earth, Gohan's training with Piccolo comes to a close, while the rest of the Z Fighters finish their training with Kami and go their separate ways.\n\n88\"Come Forth, Shenlong! The Saiyans Finally Arrive on Earth\" / \"Shenron Appears! The Saiyans Arrive Sooner than Expected!\"[16]\n\nTransliteration: \"Ide yo Shenron! Saiyajin Tsui ni Chikyū Tōchaku\" (Japanese: いでよ神龍（シェンロン）! サイヤ人ついに地球到着)21May 24, 2009 ( )May 27, 2010\n\nKing Kai has also taught Goku the Spirit Bomb technique, and tests Goku's ability to create a Spirit Bomb with a large brick as a target; Goku destroys it with no problems. However, King Kai warns Goku of the potential danger of creating a Spirit Bomb on Earth. So Goku decides to only use it as a last resort. With his training complete, Goku is ready to be resurrected. Only then is it revealed that the Saiyans will be arriving sooner than the expected; additionally, King Kai had forgotten to allow sufficient time for Goku to travel back along Snake Way to reach Earth before the Saiyans arrive there. Goku sends an urgent telepathic message to Master Roshi via King Kai's telepathy, insisting that the Dragon Balls be used to resurrect him with all possible haste. On Earth, Roshi, Bulma, and Oolong summon the Eternal Dragon Shenron and fulfill Goku's wish. Goku then begins the long journey back along Snake Way; with all of his training, increased strength and speed, and new techniques, the return journey will be far quicker than the original. The next day, the Saiyans Vegeta and Nappa land on Earth to begin their search for the Dragon Balls.\n\n99\"Yamucha's Struggle! The Terrifying Saibaimen\" / \"Yamcha's Struggle! The Terrible Saibamen!\"[16]\n\nTransliteration: \"Yamucha Funtō! Osoru Beshi Saibaiman\" (Japanese: ヤムチャ奮闘! おそるべし栽培マン)22–23May 31, 2009 ( )June 1, 2010\n\nVegeta and Nappa emerge from their two space pods and Nappa wipes out Metro East with a single blast. The two Saiyans then fly off towards the island where Piccolo and Gohan have been training. Krillin arrives first, and the three face off with Vegeta and Nappa. Piccolo learns for the first time that he is a Namekian, a member of an alien race from the planet called Namek, when told by Nappa. At Vegeta's order, Nappa plants seeds in the ground, and six Saibamen are born. Tien, Chiaotzu, and then Yamcha fly in to join in the battle. Vegeta suggests they have a game of one-on-one and instructs the Saibamen to use all of their power during their fights. Tien faces off first against a Saibaman. Tien overpowers the Saibaman, but before he's able to finish it off, Vegeta accuses the Saibaman of having held back his full power and subsequently destroys one of the Saibamen as incentive to the remaining five to obey the order to use their full strength. Next, Yamcha decides to fight in place of Krillin; the Saibaman latches onto him and self-destructs, killing Yamcha.\n\n1010\"Wait, Chaozu! Tenshinhan's Screaming Kikōhō\" / \"Sit Tight, Chiaotzu! Tien's Screaming Tri-Beam!\"[16]\n\nTransliteration: \"Matte ro Chaozu! Tenshinhan Zekkyō no Kikōhō\" (Japanese: 待ってろ餃子! 天津飯絶叫の気功砲)24–25June 7, 2009 ( )June 2, 2010\n\nNappa faces off against the Z Fighters and proves to be a formidable opponent. During Nappa's attack, Tien loses his arm. In an act of desperation, Chiaotzu attaches himself to Nappa's back and sacrifices himself using a kamikaze technique, but Nappa is unharmed by it. Grief-stricken by Chiaotzu's sacrifice, Tien uses his Tri-Beam technique on Nappa, but this also fails, and Tien dies of exhaustion as a result. With the Z Fighters now down three, the team can do nothing but hope for Goku's arrival, which is expected in three hours. The Saiyans soon learn of this trump card and scoff at the notion that any one new fighter could change the course of the battle, until Krillin informs the duo of Goku's special training. Intrigued by the possibility of challenging a newly-strengthened Goku, Vegeta issues a three-hour reprieve to wait for Goku to arrive.\n\n1111\"Will Son Goku Make It?! The Battle Resumes in 3 Hours\" / \"Will Goku Make it in Time?! Three Hours Until the Battle Resumes!\"[16]\n\nTransliteration: \"Maniau ka Son Gokū!? Sentō Saikai Made Sanjikan\" (Japanese: 間に合うか孫悟空!? 戦闘再開まで3時間)26–27June 14, 2009 ( )June 3, 2010\n\nGoku fails to arrive within the three-hour reprieve and the battle with the Saiyans resumes. At that moment, however, Goku finally reaches the end of Snake Way, is teleported back to Earth by Kami, and flies towards the battlefield on the Nimbus Cloud. Upon sensing Goku's impending arrival on his scouter, and discovering that Goku's power level is now far greater than before, Vegeta orders Nappa to kill the remaining Z Fighters, including Piccolo. The Saiyans reveal that they came to Earth for the specific purpose of obtaining and using Earth's Dragon Balls, which they learned about by monitoring Raditz's conversations while he was on Earth. Vegeta says that he and Nappa can later go to Planet Namek and use the original Namekian Dragon Balls to wish for immortality for themselves, since the Namekians were the creators of the original Dragon Balls. After Gohan strikes Nappa, an enraged Nappa fires a powerful ki blast at Gohan, but Piccolo jumps in the way at the last second to shield Gohan from the blast.\n\n1212\"The Tears Piccolo Shed... Son Goku's Furious Counterattack!\" / \"Farewell, Piccolo! Goku's Furious Counterattack!\"[16]\n\nTransliteration: \"Pikkoro ga Nagashita Namida... Son Gokū Ikari no Dai-Hangeki!\" (Japanese: ピッコロが流した涙…孫悟空怒りの大反撃!)28–29AJune 21, 2009 ( )June 7, 2010\n\nPiccolo dies from Nappa's ki blast, resulting in Kami's death and the destruction of Earth's Dragon Balls. However, Goku finally arrives at the battlefield just in time to save Gohan and Krillin. After healing the two with a Senzu bean from Korin, Goku engages Nappa in battle. Despite the mighty Nappa's efforts, it quickly becomes clear that he is no match for Goku's new level of power. Realizing this, Vegeta orders Nappa to step down and finally decides to step into the fight.\n\n1313\"This is the Kaio-Ken!! A Battle to the Limit of Goku vs. Vegeta\" / \"The Power of the Kaio-Ken! Goku vs. Vegeta!\"[16]\n\nTransliteration: \"Kore ga Kaiō-Ken da!! Genkai Batoru no Gokū tai Bejīta\" (Japanese: これが界王拳だ!! 限界バトルの悟空VSベジータ)29B–30June 28, 2009 ( )June 8, 2010\n\nWith Vegeta ready to enter the fight, Nappa realizes that he has lost, and decides to attack Gohan and Krillin instead. However, Goku disables Nappa by using his new Kaio-ken technique. With his partner now useless, Vegeta launches Nappa into the sky and mercilessly kills him with a powerful ki blast. Goku tells Gohan and Krillin to leave so he can fight Vegeta without distraction. After moving to a new battleground, the two remaining Saiyans begin their epic battle. However, Vegeta is much more powerful than Nappa was, and Goku eventually realizes that even the two-times Kaio-ken isn't enough to defeat his opponent. He then decides to break his promise to King Kai and risk his own life to use the three-times Kaio-ken.\n\n1414\"Kamehameha Clash! Vegeta's Tenacious Transformation\" / \"An All-Out Kamehame-Ha! Vegeta's Terrible Transformation!\"[16]\n\nTransliteration: \"Gekitotsu Kamehameha! Bejīta Shūnen no Dai-Henshin\" (Japanese: 激突かめはめ波! ベジータ執念の大変身)31–32AJuly 5, 2009 ( )June 9, 2010\n\nGoku powers up with the three-times Kaio-ken and attacks Vegeta with his increased power and speed. Vegeta is filled with rage as he realizes that Goku's power level exceeds his own, so he powers up even further and attempts to destroy Earth with his Galick Gun technique. Goku counters this attack with his Kamehameha blast, and when it turns out that they are evenly matched, he uses the four-times Kaio-ken to overcome Vegeta's blast, sending Vegeta flying into the outer atmosphere. Vegeta then searches for the moon to transform into a Great Ape and increase his power level. Realizing the moon has been destroyed, Vegeta releases a ball of ki that simulates the moon, and absorbs its Blutz Waves to transform into a Great Ape, which multiplies his power level by 10 times in the process. Krillin and Gohan sense Vegeta's increased power and decide to return to help Goku.\n\n1515\"Goku in Absolute Peril! Entrust Your Wishes to the Genki-Dama\" / \"Goku on the Ropes! Pin Your Hopes on the Spirit Bomb!\"[16]\n\nTransliteration: \"Zettai Zetsumei no Gokū! Genki-Dama ni Negai o Takuse\" (Japanese: 絶体絶命の悟空! 元気玉に願いを託せ)32B–33July 12, 2009 ( )June 10, 2010\n\nGoku uses Tien's Solar Flare technique to blind Great Ape Vegeta in order to buy time to create a Spirit Bomb, but Vegeta attacks Goku the instant he finishes gathering ki. Even in his battered state, Goku manages to wound Vegeta's eye, but he ends up with Vegeta crushing him in his hand and breaking most of his bones in the process. While hiding, Gohan and Krillin watch the fight and try to come up with a plan to cut off Vegeta's tail. They fail, but while Vegeta gloats, Yajirobe seizes an opening and severs Vegeta's tail with his sword, causing Vegeta to revert into his original form. Vegeta then angrily confronts Gohan, who is reluctant to fight at first, until he gets support from Goku. Goku then entrusts Krillin with the remaining ki from the previous Spirit Bomb, and Krillin successfully molds it into another Spirit Bomb.\n\n1616\"The Invincible Vegeta Defeated! Son Gohan Summons a Miracle\" / \"Defeat the Invincible Vegeta! Work a Miracle, Gohan!\"[16]\n\nTransliteration: \"Datō Fujimi no Bejīta! Kiseki o Okose Son Gohan\" (Japanese: 打倒不死身のベジータ! 奇跡を起こせ孫悟飯)34–35July 19, 2009 ( )June 14, 2010\n\nVegeta attacks Gohan with a barrage of energy blasts while Krillin attempts to lock the Spirit Bomb onto Vegeta's energy signature. Krillin throws the Spirit Bomb at Vegeta, but the Saiyan Prince manages to dodge it at the last second. Following Goku's advice, Gohan rebounds the Spirit Bomb back at Vegeta, though, surprisingly, Vegeta survives the hit, although he is badly weakened by the attack. Before Vegeta can finish the Z Fighters off, however, Gohan's tail suddenly grows back, and Vegeta decides to eliminate him in order to prevent him from transforming into a Great Ape. Just then, Yajirobe ambushes Vegeta with his sword, injuring him. However, Vegeta is able to quickly overpower Yajirobe, defeating him. Following Goku's instructions, Gohan gazes into the artificial moon Vegeta had created earlier and transforms into a Great Ape. After being thrashed around by the Great Ape, Vegeta cuts off Gohan's tail in mid-air, but Gohan falls on top of him as he turns back to normal, crushing the Saiyan Prince to the brink of death. Finally defeated, Vegeta summons his space pod and attempts to escape, but Krillin grabs Yajirobe's sword and prepares to finish off Vegeta.\n\n1717\"Dawn of a Fierce Battle!

Kibō no Hoshi wa Pikkoro no Furusato\" (Japanese: 激戦の夜明け…希望の星はピッコロの故郷)35B–36August 2, 2009 ( )June 15, 2010\n\nBefore Krillin deals the final blow to Vegeta, Goku intercedes. He asks Krillin to allow Vegeta to live, as Goku wishes to train harder and challenge Vegeta again in honorable combat. Krillin reluctantly agrees and Vegeta leaves Earth. Master Roshi, Bulma, Chi-Chi, and Korin fly to where Goku, Gohan, and Krillin are. They gather their injured, and the bodies of their deceased friends, and set off to the hospital. Krillin informs them that Kami is a Namekian, and that the planet Namek should have more inhabitants able to create Dragon Balls. After brainstorming on how to get there in a reasonable amount of time, they realize that Nappa's space pod is still a working vessel. Bulma decides to run it through some tests and see if it's still viable.\n\n1818\"The Ship Resting in Yunzabit!

Their friends and family come visit. When the television is turned on, they see a report about Nappa's space pod. Bulma presses a button on the spaceship's remote control which she thinks will summon it to them, but instead it self-destructs the pod. Before everyone gives up hope, Mr. Popo arrives, and tells them that he knows of another spaceship. It's the Namekian ship that Kami used to come to earth when he was a boy. Bulma reluctantly agrees to inspect it up in Yunzabit Heights with him. They realize the craft is voice-activated in the native Namekian language. Bulma converts the language to English in a few weeks and learns how to use the ship; Gohan and Krillin decide to accompany her on her journey to Planet Namek to search for the Namekian Dragon Balls.\n\nNo. in seriesNo. in sagaEnglish translated title / English dub titleCorresponding DBZ ep.

Meanwhile, Vegeta has landed on Planet Frieza No. 79, and after being healed from the injuries sustained on Earth, Kui tells him Frieza is currently on Namek attempting to retrieve the Dragon Balls. Vegeta is incensed and decides to chase Frieza to Namek to try to use the Dragon Balls for himself. After 30 days aboard Kami's old spaceship, Bulma, Krillin, and Gohan arrive on Namek. Bulma uses her radar and notices that four of the seven Dragon Balls are together already. Gohan senses an evil presence, but Bulma is more optimistic and believes that the Namekians probably are the ones who have them. They notice Vegeta's space pod fly overhead and land in the distance, along with a second space pod shortly thereafter. Vegeta is not too thrilled to find out that Frieza's henchmen Zarbon and Dodoria are accompanying Frieza.\n\n202\"Rebellion Against Freeza!

Meanwhile, Krillin and Gohan battle more of Frieza's minions, but not before they destroy the spaceship they used to reach the planet. Back on Earth, Yajirobe delivers Korin's new batch of Senzu beans to Goku at the hospital. After eating one of the beans, making a complete recovery from his injuries in the process, Goku immediately prepares to journey towards Planet Namek himself.\n\n213\"Protect the Dragon Balls!

Goku begins to train at 20-times Earth's gravity as he takes off for Namek. Meanwhile, the Namekians begin to fight back against Frieza's men, however Zarbon and Dodoria prove too powerful. Discovering that their people are being located via their scouters, the Namekians destroy the scouters.

Gohan and Krillin lower their ki enough to avoid being detected further, but Dende doesn't know how to. Before Vegeta can home in on Dende's power, though, a giant Namekian fish appears, giving Vegeta the thought that it was the source of ki he detected - he has not yet completely mastered all of the subtleties of sensing energy without a scouter. He later comes across a village of 20 or so Namekians, and demands to be given the Dragon Ball. When the elder Namekian of the village denies him the Dragon Ball, Vegeta slays all the Namekians and finds the Dragon Ball in one of the huts. He then proceeds to throw it in a nearby lake so that Frieza and his men cannot find it. Meanwhile, Dende takes Krillin with him to see the Grand Elder of Namek.\n\n246\"Resurrected Comrades!

Vegeta appears to be winning when Zarbon reveals a transformation that powers him up immensely, shifting the battle in his favor. Meanwhile, King Kai informs Goku via telepathy that Yamcha, Tien, Chiaotzu, and Piccolo have arrived at his planet in the Other World to receive training, much as Goku did when he died. After learning that Frieza is the tyrant terrorizing Planet Namek, King Kai warns Goku to stay away at all costs as he fears that no one is powerful enough to defeat the mighty Frieza.\n\n257\"Power Up for Kuririn!

The Elder speaks with them about the dragon balls, his ailing health, and the need for someone to help his Namekian children. He telepathically reads Krillin's past and learns of the history of Kami, including how Piccolo is the evil portion of Kami which Kami shed in order to become the Guardian of Earth. The Elder also learns that Krillin's intentions are pure, and that he has dormant power, which the Elder awakens. Krillin's power increases dramatically and he asks the Elder if Gohan can also have his dormant power awakened, to which the Elder replies yes. Meanwhile, Zarbon reports to Frieza that he has defeated Vegeta, even though Vegeta's corpse was not found. Frieza condemns Zarbon for destroying Vegeta as he thinks Vegeta has a Dragon Ball hidden and needs Vegeta to reveal its location, so he sends Zarbon to retrieve Vegeta and bring him back to the ship to heal. Zarbon finds Vegeta still alive and places him in a rejuvenation chamber inside Frieza's spaceship.\n\n268\"The Conspiracy Shatters!

He severely damages the ship with a single blast and throws all five dragon balls out of the ship. Meanwhile, Krillin arrives back at the Capsule House with a Dragon Ball that the Grand Elder had given him. Both Vegeta and Zarbon have followed him; the two quickly begin battling over possession of the dragon ball. Meanwhile, Gohan heads toward the village Vegeta attacked, discovering that there is still a Dragon Ball there. Eventually, Zarbon is killed by Vegeta, and Gohan retrieves the Dragon Ball which Vegeta had hidden in the lake and begins heading back to Bulma and the camp.\n\n279\"A Hair-Trigger Pinch!

While returning to his stashed Dragon Balls, Vegeta senses Gohan. Gohan also senses Vegeta, so he masks his ki and hides his newly found Dragon Ball. Vegeta eventually coaxes Gohan out but doesn't see the hidden Dragon Ball. Thinking he has all seven Dragon Balls, Vegeta lets Gohan live and takes off, after delivering a knee to his stomach. After returning to the nearby Namekian lake, Vegeta realizes Gohan had taken his hidden Dragon Ball and goes berserk. Meanwhile, Frieza is informed that the Ginyu Force, an elite fighting team, will be arriving shortly, bringing much needed state-of-the art scouters as well as extensive fighting strength. Goku continues his training at intense gravity levels within his spaceship.\n\n2810\"The Super Decisive Battle Draws Near!

However, Vegeta senses them while they are flying toward the tower, and confronts them. Nail informs the trio of a powerful evil force approaching the planet. Vegeta knows it is the Ginyu Force, Frieza's five most elite henchmen. Reluctantly, Gohan and Krillin agree to ally with Vegeta to use the Dragon Balls to make Vegeta immortal so that he can defeat the Ginyu Force, and Frieza, more easily. Krillin, Gohan, and Vegeta rush to retrieve the Dragon Ball which Gohan had left with Bulma (who wonders why Vegeta stole the Dragon Ball) and meanwhile, the Ginyu Force lands on the planet and meets up with Frieza. Goku completes his training at 100-times Earth's gravity on the way to Namek and discovers his results are much more impressive than he anticipated.\n\n2911\"The Special Squadron's Frontline Man!

The Ginyu Force beats them there, and with speed and a time freeze, swipe the two remaining Dragon Balls. Captain Ginyu takes the seven Dragon Balls to Frieza, and allows the other members to play Rock-Paper-Scissors to decide who gets to fight who. Recoome wins a fight with Vegeta and Guldo wins a fight with Krillin and Gohan. Krillin and Gohan fight Guldo first. After realizing that they are no easy match for him, Guldo paralyzes the two with his ESP-based \"time freeze\" technique. Vegeta, however, kills Guldo before any harm is done to the Earthlings, so Recoome decides he's next to fight. Meanwhile, Goku is ten minutes away from landing on Namek.\n\n3012\"The Hellish Recoome!

While the Saiyan prince manages to get in a few good blows, ultimately Recoome doesn't seem to be suffering any damage. Gohan and Krillin enter battle after Vegeta becomes too badly injured to continue fighting, but quickly find themselves similarly beaten and outclassed by the hulking Ginyu Force member. Elsewhere, Frieza attempts to use the Dragon Balls but nothing happens, prompting him to leave Ginyu to guard the balls while he himself goes to look for Namekians to tell him how to activate the Dragon Balls so he can use a wish to become immortal. Just when all seems lost in Vegeta, Krillin and Gohan's fight with Recoome, Goku's Capsule Corporation ship finally touches down on Planet Namek.\n\n3113\"Son Goku Finally Arrives!

Recoome, charging up a deadly attack, is defeated by a single blow from Goku. Jeice and Burter leap into battle trying a variety of techniques - none of which have the least bit of effect on Goku. Burter is knocked out by a few swift attacks from Goku, as Jeice stares in awe at his latest opponent - having never faced someone so powerful. Vegeta comes to suspect that Goku has become the first \"Super Saiyan\" in over 1,000 years, but has difficulty accepting the idea that a \"low-class\" Saiyan like Goku could become a Super Saiyan more easily than an \"elite-class\" warrior like himself.\n\n3214\"The Star Performer Takes the Stage!?

Jeice flees to Captain Ginyu and tells him what has happened. Ginyu has Frieza's men bury the Dragon Balls then sets out with Jeice towards Goku. Meanwhile, Vegeta kills Burter and then Recoome. Also, Krillin and Gohan realize that Frieza is heading towards the Grand Elder in order to obtain the password to summon the Namekian Dragon. Shortly after this, Ginyu and Jeice arrive to battle Goku. Goku tells Krillin and Gohan to leave. Vegeta tricks Goku and flies away, leaving Goku to fight alone. Goku and Captain Ginyu fight, and after a while Ginyu asks Goku to release his true power. Goku abides and begins to power up via the Kaio-ken.\n\n3315\"Son Goku at Full Power!

The captain can do nothing but tremble in fear at his more powerful opponent. The Grand Elder unlocks Dende's hidden powers and sends him off to meet the Earthlings - the Elder has realized the Earth warriors do not know how to use the Namekian Dragon Balls - and Nail begins battling Frieza to stall for time while Dende travels. Frieza is shocked that Nail has a power level of 42,000, though he states that his power level in his current form is 530,000. Frieza decides to use only one-tenth of his power and only one arm to fight Nail. While Frieza is clearly the stronger of the two, he is surprised at Nail's ability to regenerate lost limbs, though this comes at a cost of some his own power. Gohan and Krillin rescue Bulma from a dinosaur attack, and take the dragon radar to find where Frieza stashed the Dragon Balls. As the episode ends, Ginyu makes the strange move of wounding himself, and firing a strange beam at Goku.\n\n3416\"Surprise! Goku is Ginyu and Ginyu is Goku?!\"[15]\n\nTransliteration: \"Bikkuri!

Goku is now trapped in Ginyu's wounded body. Krillin and Gohan arrive at Frieza's ship and dig up the Dragon Balls. Ginyu, in Goku's body, and Jeice arrive back at the ship as well, but when Ginyu tries to power up his level is only 23,000, far less than the 180,000 level Goku had before the body switch. Realizing that great strength requires unity of mind and body, Goku (in Ginyu's body) arrives and shouts to Krillin and Gohan that they can easily defeat Ginyu. Vegeta boasts that he is close to becoming a Super Saiyan, before killing Jeice.\n\n3517\"A Great Turnabout for Goku!? Super Shenlong, Come Out Right Now!\" / \"Goku's Comeback!

Vegeta effortlessly pummels Ginyu, and an attempt by Ginyu to switch into Vegeta's body is thwarted by Goku, who intercepts the beam, sending Ginyu and Goku back to their respective original bodies. Ginyu tries again to switch with Vegeta, but Vegeta simple teleports away each time, while continuing to injure Ginyu even further. Eventually, when Vegata flies in for a final attack, Ginyu manages to lock his beam onto Vegeta, but Goku, although wounded by Krillin and Gohan attacking his body when it was taken over by Ginyu, throws a Namekian frog into the path, resulting in Ginyu switching into the frog's body. Goku convinces Vegeta to let Ginyu go, and Vegeta does so, enjoying Ginyu's humiliation. With the Ginyu Force completely defeated, Vegeta places Goku in a rejuvenation chamber inside Frieza's spaceship, and gives battle armor to Krillin and Gohan. Krillin leaves to find the Grand Elder to learn the appropriate summoning ritual for the Namekian Dragon Balls. Krillin meets up with Dende on the way over, as Dende had been heading for the Earth team already. It is revealed that the summoning has to be done in the Namekian language, so Dende will act as the translator to summon the dragon and request the wishes. Meanwhile, Nail continues to fight Frieza to stall for the time needed for Dende to reach Krillin and Gohan. Nail eventually reveals this to Frieza after realizing he will never any longer last if he continues; the enraged tyrant immediately charges back towards his spaceship to try to regain possession of the Dragon Balls. Krillin, Gohan, and Dende take advantage of the fact that Vegeta is napping, and take the Dragon Balls away from the ship and successfully summon Porunga, the Eternal Dragon of Namek.\n\n3618\"An Enraged Freeza Draws Near!

After consulting with their dead friends via King Kai's telepathic abilities, they use the first wish to revive Piccolo, which also brings Kami and the Earth's Dragon Balls back. They then use the second wish to teleport Piccolo to Namek so he can assist them in their fight with Frieza, but they are not specific enough in their wish; as a result, Piccolo is indeed transported to Namek, but ends up quite a distance away from his friends and the imminent battle with Frieza. At this point, Vegeta awakens and learns he's been duped, and speeds angrily to where Porunga is hovering over Namek. He is about to attack Krillin and Gohan until they tell him there is still one wish left; after some debate, they decide to let Vegeta use the wish to become immortal, as it seems to be the only possible way to defeat Frieza. Dende speaks the wish, but just before it can be granted, the Grand Elder dies and the Namekian Dragon Balls become useless; Porunga disintegrates and the balls turn into plain stone. Just as Vegeta thinks his luck couldn't get any worse, Frieza finally arrives, and is not happy at all that his own plans for immortality have been thwarted.\n\n3719\"A Nightmarish Super Transformation!

Piccolo arrives on Planet Namek, following being resurrected and wished there. He begins rushing towards the battlefield, and along the way encounters an ailing Nail, on the brink of death. Piccolo reluctantly performs a Namekian fusion with Nail, which increases his power substantially, and begins rushing back to the battlefield. Meanwhile, Frieza attacks the Earthlings with energy blasts, before charging towards Vegeta, after he mocks Frieza. Both Frieza and Vegeta struggle against each other while powering up, though it turns out that they are both evenly matched, much to Frieza's shock. Following this battle, Frieza transforms to his second form, following some goading from Vegeta - and this increases the tyrant's power level to over a million. With his increased power, Frieza easily destroys most of the island they are standing on, before charging at Krillin in the air, impaling him on one of his horns.\n\n3820\"Freeza Bares His Fangs!

Gohan rushes to rescue his friend, but his path is blocked by the tyrant. Gohan's rage from seeing a friend in pain gets the better of him, and he immediately starts attacking Frieza and overpowers him, much to Vegeta's surprise; Vegeta had never seen how strong emotion dramatically increases Gohan's power levels. As Gohan knocks Frieza out of the air and attacks him with energy blasts, Dende saves Krillin from drowning and heals him - this was one of his hidden powers that the Grand Elder had unlocked. Frieza charges towards Gohan to get his revenge, only to be blasted in the back by Vegeta - which, to the Saiyan prince's disappointment, does absolutely nothing. Frieza begins thrashing Gohan, but he is rescued by the healed Krillin, who cuts off Frieza's tail and distracts the tyrant with numerous attacks and escapades - buying just enough time for Dende to heal Gohan. It becomes clear that Frieza outclasses them all, so the three warriors begin blasting him with everything they've got. Once again, it has no effect, but as they are about to charge him in their moment of desperation, Piccolo finally arrives on the battlefield, announcing that he will be the one to win the battle.\n\n3921\"The Reborn Piccolo Arrives!

The two exchange blows pretty evenly for a good portion of the fight. Piccolo eventually realizes Frieza slightly holds the upper hand, so Piccolo removes his weighted training clothing and begins winning against the tyrant. Frieza finds himself backed into a corner, so he decides it is best to transform again to fight Piccolo. Becoming his grotesque, ugly third form, Frieza once again gains the upper hand and begins obliterating Piccolo with a rapid finger beam blast. Gohan rushes to rescue his mentor, and when Krillin tries to follow suit, Vegeta stops him - revealing to Krillin that he may have a strategy that will allow him to defeat the tyrant.\n\n4022\"Freeza's Final Super Transformation!

Frieza then decides to transform to his fourth form - the final and most powerful, and also his true form. Vegeta's plan to defeat Frieza involves having himself mortally wounded and then being healed by Dende - which the Saiyan prince achieves by having Krillin shoot a ki blast through his chest. Vegeta has concluded that each time a Saiyan is badly injured, his power level will increase substantially after he is healed, and he predicts that recovering from another fatal attack should make him powerful enough to defeat Frieza. Vegeta lowers his defenses to allow Krillin's attack to succeed, and Krillin proceeds to deliver a devastating blow to Vegeta. What nobody realizes is that Dende has no interest in healing Vegeta; Dende runs from Vegeta and instead heals Piccolo, who eventually convinces him to heal Vegeta as well. Frieza eventually reaches his final form, and immediately kills Dende with his Death Beam technique - having witnessed his healing abilities while transforming; Frieza has realized that this may be the key to defeating the others. Krillin, Gohan, and Piccolo go on the attack but the tyrant easily dodges every single attack they throw his way. Vegeta watches them fight from a hill, preparing to charge up to his newfound power level as Gohan finds himself on a direct collision course with another one of Frieza's blasts.\n\n4123\"The Moment We've Waited For!

While Gohan is grateful, Vegeta tells him he doesn't care about him as a person and only did it as a demonstration of his abilities now that he has declared himself a Super Saiyan. The Saiyan prince powers up to unbelievable levels of strength, which leave Gohan, Krillin, and Piccolo in awe - but no matter how much he powers up, and how many deadly attacks he dishes out, Frieza dodges and deflects everything, using only 1% of his full power. When Vegeta unleashes another powerful blast at Frieza in desperation, which could destroy Planet Namek as well, Frieza powers up a little bit further and easily deflects the blast with his foot, which then destroys another planet. Vegeta quickly finds himself on the receiving end of the tyrant's attacks, and is quickly beaten after he realizes he has not actually achieved Super Saiyan status. Frieza pounds Vegeta while berating him for his \"ungratefulness\" towards Frieza for his \"special treatment\", back when he was in service of Frieza. Gohan attempts to help but is stopped by Piccolo, who says Gohan would not be able to do anything anyway. However, just as all hope seems lost, Goku emerges from the rejuvenation chamber inside Frieza's spaceship - fully recovered and with his power once again increased beyond his expectations.\n\n4224\"Defeat Freeza, Son Goku!

Piccolo, Gohan, and Krillin are forced to stand idly by while Frieza continues to thrash the Saiyan prince. However, Goku finally arrives at the battlefield and confronts the tyrant, delivering a powerful kick to Frieza's face when he tries to attack Goku. Frieza then tries to kill Goku with a barrage of Death Beams, though Goku is able to easily deflect them all. Frieza finds Goku's appearance very surprisingly familiar, disturbing him. When Vegeta mocks Frieza, saying that Goku is the \"real\" Super Saiyan, the tyrant fires his Death Beam through Vegeta's heart, giving him just seconds to live. Before his death, Vegeta informs Goku that Frieza was responsible for the destruction of the Planet Vegeta and the entire Saiyan race; Vegeta begs Goku to defeat the tyrant and avenge their people, and even sheds true tears, which greatly moves Goku. Goku then makes a grave and buries Vegeta, before setting his sights on Frieza himself - vowing that he will defeat the merciless tyrant.\n\n4325\"Son Goku vs. Freeza!

The two exchange powerful blows and discover that their levels of strength are nearly equal. As Goku and Frieza attempt to one-up each other, Gohan, Krillin, and Piccolo back away to watch the battle from a safe distance, while Yamcha, Tien, and Chiaotzu watch from King Kai's planet in the Other World. At one point during the battle, Goku is able to take advantage of Frieza's inability to sense another's ki, but Frieza counters this by trapping Goku in an exploding ball of energy that nearly kills him, with Goku managing to break free at the last possible moment. However, Piccolo states that even after all this, neither Goku nor Frieza are fighting at full power just yet.\n\n4426\"A Physical War That Exceeds All Limits!

Frieza decides to use a little more of his power, and he fights Goku on the ground using only his feet. However, when Goku manages to land solid blows, Frieza becomes enraged and strikes back with his arm. Goku is in for a shock when he discovers the tyrant has only been using a small amount of his total power. Frieza then boosts his power up to 50%, and Goku is quickly overwhelmed, even with the use of the 10-times Kaio-ken. Meanwhile, Bulma meets the frog Ginyu, and Ginyu steals her body, leaving Bulma in the frog form. Ginyu heads for the battlefield; Bulma has managed to accompany him and both soon arrive at the battlefield where Goku and Frieza are continuing to duke it out - with Goku quickly being outclassed by the powered-up tyrant.\n\n4527\"It's a 20-Fold Kaiō-ken!

Meanwhile, Goku continues to be thrashed by Frieza. However, when Frieza attempts to drown him, he sees a vision of Frieza destroying everyone he loves - and as a result, he breaks out and uses the 20-times Kaio-ken alongside a massive Kamehameha against Frieza, who retaliates with his own blast, which leads to their energy beams being cancelled out. However, even this is not enough to defeat the tyrant, as Frieza barely suffered any injuries from their energy clash, and the use of the 20-times Kaio-ken severely weakened Goku. After taking another beating from Frieza, Goku then has another vision, this time of Vegeta and other Saiyans of the past, reminding him that should he fail, Frieza will finally succeed in exterminating the entire Saiyan race. Motivated once again, Goku stands his ground as an enraged Frieza lunges at him.\n\n4628\"This is the Last Trump Card! Goku's Extra-Large Genki-Dama\" / \"The Final Trump Card!

Despite his renewed confidence, Goku realizes he still has no chance of victory using direct physical attacks against Frieza, who is still using only 50% of his full power. At this point, Goku decides to use his ultimate technique - the Spirit Bomb. With so little ki from living things left to absorb on Namek, Goku absorbs ki from neighboring worlds as well. Creating a Spirit Bomb of this size takes extensive time and concentration, and after a while, an impatient Frieza resumes pummeling him. Piccolo decides to intervene, taking what energy Gohan and Krillin have left, deciding to attack Frieza to draw attention away from Goku and the Spirit Bomb he is creating. While gloating, Frieza notices the light from the Spirit Bomb reflected on the surface of a lake, shocking him. Though frightened by the size of the energy ball, Frieza decides to eliminate Goku before he can complete the attack. Before Frieza can finish off Goku with a beam to the forehead, Piccolo stops him with a full-force kick to the head. The now-distracted Frieza goes after Piccolo, whose attacks do nothing to faze him. The Namekian is quickly floored by Frieza, who decides to eliminate Piccolo, while Goku continues charging the Spirit Bomb.\n\n4729\"Awaken Warrior of Legend...

Then, an enraged Frieza decides to destroy the entire planet and begins charging a Death Ball. Goku completes the Spirit Bomb and hurls it down upon Frieza, which also absorbs Frieza's charging Death Ball. The tyrant manages to catch the Spirit Bomb, but is unable to stop it from pushing him into the ocean, before exploding on him. The Z Fighters celebrate their apparent victory and start making plans to return to Earth. However, Frieza reappears and, though badly injured by the Spirit Bomb, he is still powerful enough to take them all out. Frieza fires his Death Beam straight at Goku, but Piccolo jumps in the way and takes the beam to the chest, which knocks him unconscious. Frieza next sets his sights on Krillin and causes Krillin's body to explode from the inside, killing him. Enraged by these sacrifices, Goku undergoes a radical transformation in which his eyes turn from black to green, his black hair turns blonde, and his body is surrounded by an aura of golden light, becoming a Super Saiyan. With his powers now greatly enhanced, Goku orders Gohan to take Piccolo to his spaceship, find Bulma, and leave Namek, while he stays behind to handle Frieza.\n\n4830\"The Angry Super Saiyan!

Frieza launches several counterattacks at Goku, but they have no effect at all. As the tyrant stares in awe at his more-powerful opponent, he realizes that his worst nightmare has come true - a Super Saiyan, which Frieza had long secretly feared, has finally been born. In a desperate attempt to defeat Goku, Frieza hurls an attack down upon Namek itself, in an effort to destroy the planet and everyone on it.\n\n4931\"Exact Vengeance, Son Goku!

Super Saiyan Goku is confident that he can defeat Frieza within that time; however, Frieza then decides to power up to 100% of his full power. As their fight continues, Goku yells at Frieza to stop stalling while beating him, and Frieza begins powering up, first to 60% and then 70% of his maximum power. At 70% power, Frieza manages to blast Goku deep into the planet's surface, giving him pause. When Frieza finally begins powering up to 100%, King Kai urges Goku to strike at Frieza and take him down before he can reach full power, which Goku refuses to do. Much to King Kai's amazement, Goku allows Frieza to reach his full power rather than attacking while Frieza powers up, wishing to defeat the tyrant at his best and also avenge his friend Krillin.\n\n5032\"Freeza's Do-or-Die Full Power!

When Frieza claims that he was just warming up, Goku reveals that he hasn't even begun to use his full power yet. As the epic battle between Goku and Frieza continues on the dying Planet Namek, King Kai is informed by Kami on Earth that Mr. Popo has gathered all seven of Earth's Dragon Balls. Upon learning of the Earth's Dragon Balls' ability to resurrect multiple people despite being limited to one wish per use, King Kai asks that they be used to bring back to life all those on Namek who were killed by Frieza and his minions, thus also bringing back the Grand Elder, as well as the Namekian Dragon Balls, which still have one more wish to be used. King Kai plans to use this final wish to teleport everyone on Namek to Earth except for Frieza, leaving the tyrant to be the only one present when Namek explodes. Mr. Popo then summons Shenron to fulfill King Kai's first wish. Failing to defeat Goku, an enraged Frieza gathers all of his energy and charges at Goku, with Goku firing a Kamehameha at Frieza in response.\n\n5133\"Goku's Furious Battle Cry! Make It in Time...

Meanwhile, King Kai informs Kami of his plan to resurrect the Namekians and then to remove everyone from Namek except for Frieza. On Namek, Goku finally unleashes his full power against Frieza. Seeing that he is unable to overpower Goku directly, Frieza disengages from the beam clash and slams Goku from the side, driving him deep into the planet, which generates a volcanic eruption in the process. Believing that he had finally defeated Goku, Frieza gloats over Goku's apparent fall. After sensing the disappearance of Goku's energy signature, Gohan decides to fight Frieza to stall him until the planet's destruction. Meanwhile, Shenron succeeds in resurrecting everyone killed by Frieza and his henchmen on Namek (minus Krillin), and the Grand Elder and the Namekian Dragon Balls are also brought back. When Frieza spots Gohan, he decides to power down to 50% of his full power to give him more of a fair advantage. Although Frieza initially has the upper hand, pounding the Saiyan, Gohan's rage powers him up even further, and he is able to overwhelm Frieza. Frieza powers up to 100% full power once again, but at that moment, Goku emerges from the ocean. Goku resumes his fight with Frieza, while Gohan flees back to Goku's spaceship. King Kai immediately contacts the Grand Elder and quickly informs him of the situation. The Grand Elder then sends Dende to Porunga in order to use the final wish to teleport everyone on Namek to Earth, except for Frieza. However, Goku requests that he remain on Namek as well, so he can finish Frieza once and for all. Porunga fulfills this wish and teleports everyone to Earth except Goku and Frieza. The two combatants then prepare themselves for the final round before Namek's explosion.\n\n5234\"Two Remain on a Vanishing Planet! This is the Final Showdown\" / \"Duel on a Vanishing Planet!

Although Frieza is able to land some blows, it turns out that Goku is still stronger, and eventually gains the upper hand in the fight. Goku soon notices that Frieza's power is quickly decreasing, due to his 100% full power taking its toll on his body, and also due to the injuries that Frieza had suffered earlier. Satisfied that he has won, Goku decides to call it quits and begins to depart. Unable to accept this, Frieza launches a pair of heat-seeking ki disks at Goku. The Super Saiyan manages to avoid the disks, though Frieza tethers the disks' to Goku's heat signature, using them to chase him down. Eventually, however, Frieza is sliced in half by his own attack.\n\n5335\"The Final Blow, Son Goku... Planet Namek Scatters Throughout Space\" / \"Goku's Final Attack!

This makes him the new Grand Elder, thereby preserving the power of the Namekian Dragon Balls. Meanwhile, on Namek, the dying Frieza begs for mercy from Goku. Despite his better judgement, Goku cannot ignore Frieza's pleas for help and gives the tyrant some of his own ki before departing. However, Frieza lets his pride get the better of him and unleashes one final ki blast at Goku, attempting to kill him, but the angered Super Saiyan easily repels the blast right back at the tyrant and seemingly destroys Frieza in the process. Goku then attempts to escape in Frieza's spaceship, but is unable to make it take off, due to the damage from Vegeta's earlier attack when he was stealing the Namekian Dragon Balls from Frieza. Namek finally explodes and it appears that Goku perished along with the planet.\n\n5436\"Goku Vanishes in Space... Return to Life! Super Warriors\" / \"Goku Vanishes Into Space!

However, Vegeta comes up with the idea of using the Dragon Balls to first bring Goku and Krillin's souls to the Earth's check-in station in the Other World, from where they can be resurrected on Earth. 130 days after their use on Namek, the Namekian Dragon Balls become re-active, and the first two wishes are used to successfully revive Krillin; it is revealed that Goku is actually still alive and that he will return to Earth on his own later. Yamcha is then brought back to life with the third wish. Another 130 days later, the Namekian Dragon Balls are used to revive both Tien and Chiaotzu, and are then used to teleport all of the native Namekians to a new planet. The Z Fighters then return to their peaceful lives, waiting patiently for Goku to return.\n\nNo.Japanese translated title / English titleCorresponding DBZ ep.

However, it is revealed that Frieza managed to survive his battle with the Super Saiyan, has been rebuilt into a cyborg by his father King Cold, and is heading towards Earth, intending to exact revenge on Goku. The rest of the Z Fighters gather to defend the Earth from Frieza, despite knowing the odds are against them, especially since King Cold is even more powerful than Frieza. However, as soon as Frieza, King Cold, and their army of soldiers arrive on Earth, they are met by a mysterious teenager wielding a sword, who says that he has come to kill them.\n\n56\"I'll Defeat Freeza!

The evil tyrant attempts to destroy this second Super Saiyan, but is unsuccessful. The teenager urges Frieza to use his full power, but Frieza is hesitant to do so (since he planned to save his full power for fighting Goku), though he eventually decides to unleash a Supernova, his most powerful attack on him. The teenager is able to hold back Frieza's attack, and he manages to avoid Frieza's detonation of the energy ball as well. Soon afterward, he slices Frieza into pieces with his sword, before blasting him away. King Cold tries to defeat the Super Saiyan himself, but the teenager easily kills him and destroys his ship. After reverting to his normal state, the teenager spots the Z Fighters and says that Goku will be arriving nearby soon. Despite their skepticism, the Z Fighters agree to join him in awaiting Goku's arrival.\n\n57\"Welcome Back Son Goku! The Confession of the Mysterious Young Boy Trunks\" / \"Welcome Back, Goku!

There is no time for celebration, however, as the mysterious teenager pulls Goku aside to talk with him in private. After testing Goku's Super Saiyan powers, the teenager reveals that his name is Trunks and that he comes from an apocalyptic future 20 years from the present, as well as that he is the future son of Bulma and Vegeta. He further informs Goku that in three years from now, a pair of deadly androids, built by Doctor Gero of the former Red Ribbon Army, will begin a rampage on Earth and kill all of the Z Fighters, except for Goku, who will have died from a heart virus six months before their assault. Trunks then supplies Goku with a heart antidote made in his future timeline, instructing him to take it when the virus attacks him. Piccolo hears the whole conversation using his special hearing. Goku promises that he and the other Z Fighters will train hard for the next three years to prepare for the androids' assault, and Trunks then returns to the future in his time machine.\n\n58\"New Technique of Goku, Instant Movement!

He further explains that he eventually landed on a planet called Yardrat and was nursed back to health by the friendly inhabitants of the planet. He also reveals that he learned from them a special teleportation technique called Instant Transmission. The Z Fighters then go their separate ways to each begin preparing themselves for the androids' assault. After three years of intense training, they all head off to meet on the island on which Trunks had indicated that the androids would begin their attack.\n\n59\"The Pair Who Don't Leave a Trace!

However, as the time approaches, the androids are nowhere to be seen. Yajirobe arrives to deliver Korin's new batch of Senzu beans to the others, but as soon as he departs, the androids shoot down his ship and immediately descend into the nearby city before the Z Fighters can get a glimpse of them. Gohan goes to rescue Yajirobe, while the rest of the Z Fighters fly down to the city as well to search out their enemies. After a period of searching, Yamcha becomes the first victim of the androids, after having his energy absorbed by Android #20, and then being impaled. The others arrive just in time to save him, and Goku eventually persuades the androids to move to a new location to fight after a large portion of the city is destroyed.\n\n60\"Attacked on Both Sides by an Internal Enemy?!

However, once Yamcha reveals the androids' ability to absorb energy, he, Krillin, and Gohan head off to warn the others. Meanwhile, it is revealed to Goku that the androids are a result of years of research conducted by Dr. Gero, in which miniature spy robots were used to analyze Goku's fighting techniques and developments in strength, all in an attempt to exact revenge on Goku for destroying the Red Ribbon Army. However, Gero did not analyze Goku during his time on Planet Namek, and thus the androids are unaware of his ability to transform into a Super Saiyan, which Goku gladly demonstrates in front of them. A battle then ensues between Goku and Android #19, and though Goku clearly has the upper hand, he soon appears to be losing energy. Eventually, Goku is seen clutching the left side of his chest, which Gohan immediately recognizes as a symptom of the heart virus that Trunks had warned Goku of. However, the virus is attacking Goku's heart much later than Trunks had predicted. As Goku struggles to stay conscious, #19 prepares to finish the battle by absorbing Goku's remaining energy. Piccolo tries to intervene, however, Android #20 blasts Piccolo with his eye beams, which sends him crashing to the ground.\n\n61\"No Chance of Victory Against #19!

Yamcha then escorts Goku back home in order to administer the heart antidote to him. Vegeta then faces off with the androids, and much to everyone's surprise, transforms into a Super Saiyan. It is revealed that, whereas Goku's first transformation was triggered by his rage over Frieza's murder of Krillin, Vegeta's was triggered by his rage at simply being unable to surpass Goku. The battle then begins, and it's clear that Vegeta has the edge over #19. Even the android's energy absorption attack proves futile, as Vegeta tears off the android's hands, making it impossible for it to absorb anymore energy from its opponents. As the android runs away in fear, Vegeta launches his Big Bang Attack and finishes the battle, leaving nothing but the android's head intact. Android #20 then escapes into the nearby cliffs, planning to use the terrain to launch a surprise attack on the Z Fighters.\n\n62\"Piccolo's Assault!

Frustrated at his enemy's deceptiveness, Vegeta fires a large ki blast at the cliffs, planning to level the area. Seeing this opportunity, #20 emerges from his hiding place, only to absorb Vegeta's blast and run away before Vegeta can catch up. The android then attacks Piccolo from behind and begins to drain his energy, although this is thwarted by Gohan, who senses Piccolo's fading ki and attacks Android #20. After receiving a Senzu bean, Piccolo then faces off against his attacker, and proves to be more than a match for the android. Meanwhile, Trunks finally returns from the future, and is disturbed to find that the remains of Android #19 are different from the androids that he faced in his own timeline. He then arrives at the current battlefield, and also seems not to recognize #20. Realising that he has no chance of victory, #20 decides to retreat to his laboratory, but not before launching a huge blast that engulfs most of the area - including Bulma's ship, which plummets towards the ground.\n\n63\"Pursue!

Meanwhile, Trunks rescues his mother and young self, and berates Vegeta for failing to protect his family. Bulma then reveals that #20 may actually be the androids' creator, Dr. Gero, who has seemingly converted himself into one as well. The group then plan to find the lab and destroy the androids before Gero can activate them. Vegeta also sets off to find the lab, but with the intentions of fighting the androids as a demonstration of his power. Trunks leaves to stop his father, while Piccolo finally unveils the truth of Trunks' origin to the rest of the group. He knew this because he overheard the conversation between Trunks and Goku. Meanwhile, Piccolo, Krillin and Tien split up and search the mountains where Gero's lab is rumoured to be located, while Gohan takes Bulma, baby Trunks, and Yajirobe home. Meanwhile, Krillin is attacked by the doctor, but is spared when Gero senses Piccolo nearby and escapes.\n\n64\"#17 and #18, and...! The Artificial Humans Awaken\" / \"Number 17 and Number 18!

Tien, Piccolo, Vegeta, and Trunks soon locate him and break into the lab, although by this point Gero has already awakened Androids #17 and #18. Although initially appearing loyal, the duo demonstrate their independence when #17 destroys Gero's remote, ensuring that he cannot deactivate them should they disobey him, and #18 attempts to activate Android #16 - a fully mechanical model deemed a failure by Gero. #17 then kills Gero, by severing and then crushing his head. In an act of desperation, Trunks launches a large ki blast at the androids, hoping to destroy #16 before he is activated. Although the entire lab is decimated, both androids and #16's pod remain intact, and he is awakened anyway. The trio then decide to carry out their initial orders, and set out to kill Goku. However, their plans are disrupted when Vegeta intervenes, challenging the three androids to a battle.

Super Saiyan Trunks tries to help his father, but is also easily defeated and gets his sword broken in the process. Piccolo and Tien then get beaten down effortlessly by Android #17, while Krillin stays behind and watches the horror, and Android #16 simply observes the nearby birds.

Vegeta flies off in anger, having been beaten, while Trunks explains to the others how the androids of the future are different from the ones they just fought. The androids of the present are apparently more powerful, but they seem to be less cruel. There also was not an Android #16 in Trunks' time period. Piccolo then flies off to try to convince Kami to merge with him once again, believing that it is the only way to stop the androids. However, Kami believes that the androids are not entirely evil and that the only reason they fought against the Z Fighters was because the Z Fighters attacked first.

Krillin and Trunks head toward Gingertown, where Piccolo and the monster begin fighting. Piccolo has the advantage, but is surprised when the monster uses Piccolo's own Makankosappo technique on him. The two exchange blows, and then the monster states that Piccolo only has the upper hand because he [the monster] has not yet reached his \"perfect form.\" He then surprises everyone by powering up a Kamehameha and launching it point-blank. Piccolo's dodge leaves him open to the monster's follow-up attack, which he uses to trap Piccolo in a hold and pierce his arm. Piccolo manages to escape, but his left arm has been completely incapacitated. Sensing he has won, the monster states that his name is Cell and reveals that he is an android.\n\n70\"Escape Tactic, Taiyoken!

Cell furthermore reveals that by absorbing Androids #17 and #18, he will achieve his \"Perfect Form,\" making him \"invincible,\" since Dr. Gero's computer predicted that in his Perfect Form, Cell would be the most powerful being in the known universe. With the androids destroyed in his own timeline, he was forced to travel to the present one in Trunks' time machine, after killing him. Having learned Cell's identity and intentions, Piccolo regenerates his arm and prepares to fight. At this point, Trunks and Krillin arrive, and Cell realizes he has no chance of winning. He surprises everyone by using Tien's Solar Flare technique to blind them, and then flees. Vegeta and Tien arrive, and Piccolo explains everything he's learned. Meanwhile, Cell heads toward Nickytown to absorb more people, until his power exceeds that of the androids'.\n\n71\"Attack the Elusive Cell! Son Goku, Finally Revived!\" / \"The Hunt for Cell Is On!

Trunks and Krillin go to Dr. Gero's laboratory, where they discover a set of blueprints for Android #17. In hopes that the prints will allow Bulma and Dr. Briefs to uncover a weakness in the androids, they take the prints before destroying the developing Cell and the rest of the laboratory. Trunks goes to find Vegeta while Krillin delivers the prints to Bulma. Several days go by, during which Piccolo and the others are unable to locate Cell. However, back at the Kame House, Chi-Chi and Master Roshi start hearing thunderous booms on the island and rush to the window to find a fully recovered Goku launching Kamehameha blasts into the horizon. The three share a joyous moment before Goku turns serious and states that he'd fare no better against the androids than Vegeta did. Also like Vegeta, he states his goal of surpassing the level of Super Saiyan.\n\n72\"Surpass Super Saiyan! Now, Into the Room of Spirit and Time\" / \"Break the Super Saiyan Barrier!

The chamber only has a capacity of two so Goku allows Vegeta and Trunks to go in first. Goku explains a years worth of training in the chamber is actually only one day in the outside world. When Trunks and Vegeta step inside the chamber, all they see is a vast amount of nothingness. While this is going on, the androids arrive at the Kame House and ask for Goku's whereabouts. Piccolo refuses to tell them, which results in a fight between Piccolo and Android #17. Piccolo overpowers #17 and tries to finish him off, but #17 manages to dodge the attack. Back at Kami's Lookout, Vegeta and Trunks are due to be coming out of the time chamber any second now, which will reveal if it is possible to go beyond the level of a Super Saiyan.\n\n73\"This is the Power of a Super-Namekian! #17 vs. Piccolo!\" / \"The Super Namekian Powers Up!

Meanwhile, Piccolo and Android #17 are fighting each other. After #17 gets serious, it turns out that he and Piccolo are evenly matched. Cell senses the two fighting and starts making his way towards them, stating that his power level is now higher than theirs. Krillin, and the others on a nearby island, receive a call from Bulma saying that she has completed the switch to shut down the androids and prepares to deliver it to the others. #17 states that since his stamina and power level will never drop, he will be the victor of the battle. However, Cell arrives at the scene of the battle, leaving Piccolo shocked. Meanwhile, Goku and Gohan are still waiting for Vegeta and Trunks to come out of the Hyperbolic Time Chamber.\n\n74\"Run #17! Piccolo, A Battle for Suicidal Resistance\" / \"Run Android 17!

Unwilling to wait helplessly, Tien leaves the Kame House, as well, to help Piccolo on the battlefield. Meanwhile, #17 refuses to heed Piccolo's warnings about Cell, and is quickly defeated. Piccolo tries to ward off Cell, but Cell has become too powerful for him to handle. Cell quickly breaks Piccolo's neck, before blasting him through the chest at point-blank range, and then Cell tosses Piccolo's body into the sea. Then, Cell turns his attention to Android #17, intending to absorb him.\n\n75\"Unmeasured Power! The Silent Warrior #16, Makes his Move\" / \"Power Unknown!

The two fight at an even level, with #16 landing a massive blast on Cell. However, Cell survives and uses the opportunity to absorb Android #17, much to #16's horror. Cell transforms into his Semi-Perfect Form and gains incredible power, after which #16's attacks prove utterly ineffective. Just when all hope is lost, Tien appears and uses his Tri-Beam technique to hold off Cell so Android #16 and #18 can escape.\n\n76\"Tenshinhan's Do-or-Die Shin Kikoho!

Tien eventually runs out of ki and collapses, at the mercy of a furious Cell. Unwillingly to wait idly at Kami's Lookout anymore, Goku uses his Instant Transmission to come to Tien's aid. While confronting Cell, Goku also notices that Piccolo is still alive, and teleports back to the Lookout with the two fallen warriors. Shortly afterward, Trunks and Vegeta emerge from the Hyperbolic Time Chamber, stating that they have successfully surpassed the level of Super Saiyan. They leave to confront Cell, while Goku and Gohan prepare to enter the time chamber for their own training. Meanwhile, Cell begins destroying islands in a bid to make #18 show herself.\n\n77\"Super Saiyan Surpassed! The Daring Vegeta Strikes Cell\" / \"Beyond Super Saiyan!

Before he can launch his attack, Vegeta and Trunks arrive as Super Saiyans. After some taunting, Vegeta initiates a transformation that produces a form beyond that of Super Saiyan - evidenced by increased muscle size and an intense golden aura. As an Ascended Super Saiyan, Vegeta makes easy work of Cell while Trunks watches from the sidelines. Meanwhile, Goku and Gohan begin their training in the Hyperbolic Time Chamber, where Goku states that he will not only make Gohan a Super Saiyan, but that he will make Gohan stronger than even himself.\n\n78\"The Surging Resentment of Cell!

Meanwhile, Vegeta effortlessly pushes Cell around and inflicts significant damage. When Cell uses Vegeta's own Galick Gun to no effect, he realizes that he will not be able to absorb Android #18. Enraged, Cell goes on about how if he was able to absorb #18 then he would become his perfect form and be able to defeat Vegeta easily. He attempts to persuade Vegeta into letting him absorb #18 by appealing to the Saiyan's passion for fighting strong opponents. Not far away, Krillin contemplates whether or not to use the emergency shutdown controller, and he has trouble deciding due to his embarrassing moment with Android #18 during their first encounter (when Android #18 kissed Krillin).\n\n79\"And So the Situation Takes a Turn for the Worst...

Krillin tells her that now is their chance to get off the island, and that she and Android #16 must leave now. Cell successfully persuades Vegeta to let him find and absorb Android #18, but Trunks is determined to prevent this and delivers his own beating to Cell. During a break in the action, Cell spots Krillin, #16, and #18, who are distracted by their own awkward meeting. Vegeta attempts to keep Trunks from interfering, forcing Trunks to attack his own father in order to prevent him from allowing Cell to reach his perfect form. While this is going on, Cell is savoring the moment and leisurely going about picking off Android #16 and Krillin. Despite their best efforts and a sound beating from Trunks, Cell is ultimately able to blind everyone via the Solar Flare, absorb #18, and achieve his Perfect Form.\n\n80\"The Tables Have Turned!

Gohan thinks of all the times he has let his friends down and gets angry, resulting in him finally turning into a Super Saiyan for the first time. Back at the battlefield, Vegeta disregards Cell's Perfect Form as nothing special and he is just the same as before. Meanwhile, Krillin is angry at Cell for absorbing Android #18, so he charges towards Cell and attempts to attack him by using his Kienzan technique, but the attack has no effect whatsoever. Cell then lightly kicks Krillin to one side, leaving him almost dead, but Trunks rushes to his aid and feeds him a Senzu bean, saving him from near death. Vegeta starts his fight with Cell and after a short while he soon realizes Cell's power far exceeds his own. In the background, Krillin and Trunks are talking about how Trunks has hidden his own true power, one even greater than Vegeta's but kept secret from him due to Vegeta's towering pride. Trunks plans to fight Cell when Vegeta is unconscious in order to hide his powers from Vegeta to prevent his father from losing his pride.\n\n81\"Full-Power Strike of Vegeta!

Vegeta calculates his attack and avoids destroying the entire Earth and also manages to take off Cell's right arm, but with Piccolo's genes Cell easily regenerates his arm. Cell knocks Vegeta unconscious and Trunks takes this chance to unleash his hidden powers onto Cell. Trunks momentarily lets Cell push him around a little in order to create a chance for Krillin to take the unconscious Vegeta to a safe location. Now that Vegeta is out of commission, Trunks and Cell can begin their real fight.\n\n82\"Super Power Awakening! Trunks Surpasses his Father\" / \"The Strongest Super Saiyan!

Trunks and Cell seem to be evenly matched at first, but after a while Trunks' attack cease to hit Cell. Trunks decides to power up even more but he is still unable to connect his attacks to hit Cell. In the Hyperbolic Time Chamber, Goku manages to power up to the same bulked-up transformation as Trunks, but decides not to use that form, because in order to achieve that form, even though great power is gained, Goku concludes the decrease in speed is too much - and having power but not being able to hit your opponent is useless, so he decides to focus on mastering his normal Super Saiyan form instead. This turns out to be the same reason why Trunks cannot defeat Cell, and Trunks power level begins to drop due to the strain of maintaining his transformation. Cell learns that Goku is training to defeat him, so in order to waste time he decides to hold his own World Martial Arts Tournament where anyone can enter to fight him.\n\nNo.Japanese translated title / English titleCorresponding DBZ ep.

Bulma also notifies everyone at Kami's Lookout to go there to meet up. After Cell finishes arranging his tournament, he then heads off to a news station to broadcast his message via television announcing details about his tournament, the \"Cell Games,\" and states if that all the warriors lose to him, he will kill every single last human being.

Meanwhile, Goku and Gohan finish their training in the Hyperbolic Time Chamber, and emerged as Full Power Super Saiyans. Goku immediately requests that Mr. Popo prepare a meal and Trunks explains the latest Cell developments. Goku then teleports to the site of the Cell Games and confronts Cell. After returning to the Lookout, Goku announces he and Gohan will not be entering the time chamber again. Instead, for the remaining nine days until the Cell Games, they will train in the real world.

Hearing about this over the radio, Goku asks Piccolo if it is possible to separate with Kami, so he can use the Dragon Balls to revive all the people Cell killed. Since Piccolo can't separate, Goku theorises that he can convince another Namekian to stay on E"
