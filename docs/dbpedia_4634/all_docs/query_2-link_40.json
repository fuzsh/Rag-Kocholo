For some reason this game was not ever released officially in the USA. Also this UK version retains most of the Japanese names of the characters making it rather confusing for UK gamers where the cartoon DBZ has only recently been shown regularly. So this FAQ aims to do two things. First of all it will provide the official English names of the special moves each characters has for US gamers who have imported the Japanese version. Second with each character I have added some clarification and explanation of them, including USA character names and appearances in the anime for the UK gamer. And of course detailed fighting strategies and a look at all game modes are contained here as well! Hope it provides enlightenment on all sides! And before I go on I must just take time out to thank Rev. Eric \"Vegita\" Johnson for getting me hooked on the series and games and always being ready to answer my damn fool questions about it. He is my Dragon Ball guru... I am not worthy! *********************************************************************** REVISIONS - (24/03/2003). First Version. Movelists typed up, with strategy for each character and some background on each one. Covered extra modes and started a general FAQ. Questions to the usual email address. ========================================================================= *************************** 2) GENERAL FAQ ****************************** ========================================================================= Dragon Ball Z currently airs on the UK digital channel CNX. Until 2002 the series was relatively unknown in Britain. It had aired patchily on the Cartoon Network here, but it didn't get a real following here until 2002. That year Cartoon Network launched a more adult orientated cartoon channel on UK digital cable and satellite. It runs DBZ four times daily in one-hour blocks with early episodes running early on and new episodes later in the day. It was off the back of this massively increased exposure that two Dragon Ball games were re-released for the Psone. Originally out in 1996, Dragon Ball: Final Bout and Dragon Ball: Ultimate Battle 22 sank without trace due to the fact the show had not ever aired here at that time. Now the show is beginning to develop the same kind of dedicated fan base it has enjoyed in the USA for some years now. The DBZ show itself is in fact the second in a three series arc of stories revolving around main character Goku. These themselves were based on a popular manga series by Akira Toriyama that ran throughout the 1980's in the magazine Shonen Jump. The initial Japanese cartoon series debuted in 1982 and was called Dragon Ball; in it Goku was not a super-human alien but a monkey-tailed boy. He joins up with a young woman called Bulma who is searching for the seven Dragon Balls that can grant any wish when brought together. This first series saw Goku battle evil villain Piccolo, grow up, marry Chi Chi and have a son, Gohan. It ran for 153 episodes, and has only recently been dubbed into English. After this series there was Dragon Ball Z, which ran for 276 episodes. This was split into three sagas. The Saiyen saga, the Android Saga and the Buu saga. This introduced Goku's new alien background, friend/foe Vegeta and the super villains Freiza, Cell and Buu amongst others. This also has only recently finished being translated into English. It is this series that has sparked the rise in interest in Dragon Ball in the UK. A further series called Dragon Ball: GT was made, but by this time original creator Akira had nothing to do with it and many consider it more of a fan-fic than part of Official DBZ lore. It ran for 64 episodes and as of yet has not been dubbed into English. Many, many games have been released over the years based on the show. Few have made it to western shores. Luckily here in the UK we have been fortunate to get one of the best ones in Dragon Ball Ultimate Battle 22. Twenty-seven characters are available and from all era's of DBZ along with a couple from the original Dragon Ball. I have covered more about each characters appearance in the show along with their movelists. But for in-depth episode-by-episode Dragon Ball coverage I suggest you visit this excellent site: http://www.pojo.com Probably the question I have been asked the most is why this game got a UK/European release and not a US one? I haven't been able to find any real reason why. For some strange reason several recent Dragon Ball games have also debuted in the UK/Europe about a month before they came out in the USA. For example DBZ: Budokai on the PS2 and the GBC game DBZ: Ultimate Card Warrior made the UK first. The only reason I can think of is that the UK/European versions have always retained the Japanese voice acting (inc. Final Bout, Battle 22 and Budokai) and perhaps that's why they came out first, while the USA versions needed to be redubbed with the USA cartoon voice artists. ========================================================================= ***************** 3) BASIC FIGHTING MOVES AND TACTICS ******************* ========================================================================= Every character has special moves that are listed in the individual sections below. However there are also several common moves that are listed below: Punch square Kick cross Energy Ball circle Restore Energy Hold down square or cross or circle Deflect Energy Ball square + cross Fast Dash R1 and L1 Short back dash tap backwards twice Throw/In Close Attack f + square or b + square Jump Up Crouch Down Block Hold backwards Crouching Block Hold down/backwards Fly Triangle Unlike most fighting games in which you have a set number of rounds to fight through, DBZUB22 has only one round. Both characters have a doubled health bar, which needs to be depleted twice for a win. Underneath is an \"energy\" metre in red. This is used to power energy based attacks. The more powerful the attack, the more it will use up. Managing your energy is the key to most successful bouts. If you allow it to be over-depleted your character will have to pause to catch breath leaving you powerless to defend. You can recharge energy by holding one of the three attack buttons; this also leaves you open to attack. The energy metre will recharge very slowly on its own as the fights goes on. The exceptions to this are C16 and C18. Their energy bars recharge much faster constantly, but you cannot do a fast recharge by holding down an attack button with them. Mr. Satan cannot use energy based attacks and so has no energy bar, however he is compensated for by having a wider range of powerful attacks that can be performed without worrying over loss of power. Genius Turtle and Mr. Satan cannot fly up in the air and are at a slight disadvantage against flying characters. All characters projectile attacks have some degree of homing ability for targeting airborne opponents. Fast Dashes can also be performed while airborne. EXPLANATION OF MOVE INPUT INSTRUCTIONS Here is a lovely rendition of the d-pad positions: O O O \\ | / --O means \"forward\" (f) O-- --O \\ O means \"down-forwards\" (df) / | \\ O O O O-- means \"back\" (b) A capital F or D or U means press and HOLD that button while performing the rest of the button presses. If the f, d, u, b is in small case then that means just tap. A comma separating the commands means the buttons must be pressed in quick succession, but not at the same time. A Plus sign + indicates when two buttons must be pressed together. A lot of the moves must be executed by rolling the thumb through quarter and half circle motions of the d-pad back and forth starting from the down position. Mostly I have shortened these to \"QCF\" which is the motion from down, down-forward and forwards and \"QCB\" which is the motion from down, down-back and back. But occasionally some characters have moves that reverse this, so I have had to list them as full range of moves i.e. \"b, db, d\". The quarter circle motion is the same, it's just going the other way from back or forwards to down. The same goes for \"HCB\" and \"HCF\". These require you to roll the d-pad through 180 degrees from front to back or back to front via the down directions. Again then \"HCB is the movement through f, df, d, db, b and HCF is b, db, d, df, f. ========================================================================= ******************** 4) DEFAULT CHARACTER MOVELISTS ********************* ========================================================================= Because the UK game manual is so eccentrically translated, I thought it would be fun to include the manuals character bios and captions for all you Japlish fans reading this. Don't email about the poor grammar in the bios, anything in \"\" marks I am quoting direct! ------------------------------------------------------------------------- a) SUPER GOKU ------------------------------------------------------------------------- \"WHAT CAN YOUR ENEMIES DO? THEY ARE TOO SLOW FOR YOU!\" BIO: \"Nobody has overcome the supreme limits of the power of the super-warriors like you! More agile, and mastering the very smallest parts of your body, your punches and kicks are super-powerful. But you are strongest in close combat: you are master of the block. And because you can launch the KAMEHA-MEHA, or even the GIGA-KAMEHA-MEHA at any given moment, it's true to say that you are the total warrior, and you know how to make the most of any situation!\" SPECIAL MOVES Super Elbow Hit qcf, square Super Tortoise Sweep f, b, f, cross Shiriou Kick hcb, cross Tayoken d, u, circle Energy Piercer qcf, circle Energy Converger B, f + circle Kameha-meha hcb, circle Giga-Kameha-meha qcb, f, circle STRATEGY: Very much the good all-round character for new players to use. Good speed, good power and a good range of attacks. One move that stands out is the Tayoken. If an opponent is caught in the range of this attack they will not be damaged but will be stunned for a few seconds. So it's a good chance to launch a powerful attack open their helpless bodies, muahahah! BACKGROUND: The story of Goku is the story of all the Dragon Ball series. From his beginnings as monkey tailed boy, through to super-powered alien, ending with him passing into legend. He grows up, marries, has children, dies, comes back, becomes awesomely powerful and generally powers the series along. ------------------------------------------------------------------------- b) GOHAN ------------------------------------------------------------------------- \"MINUS? PERHAPS! BUT MAXUS COURAGE AND STRENGTH! ALL YOU HAVE TO DO IS GO FOR IT!\" BIO: \"First child of SUPER GOKU and CHICHI, you has PICCOLO as a sensei: you have great respect for him. However you are kind and timid like a little gentleman! But within you hide a power that is capable of making such terrifying enemies as FREIZA and VEGETA tremble with fear! Even though you are small and your fighting technique is nothing special, your special moves such as your KAMEHA-MEHA or MASEN LIGHT are very powerful.\" SPECIAL MOVES Super Jet Vertical Hook qcf, square Wing Kick f, d, cross (while jumping) Hyper-Slide b, db, d, cross Flight Shoot qcf, cross Energy Peircer qcf, circle Energy Converger B, f + circle Masen Light hcf, circle Kameha-meha qcb, f, circle STRATEGY: Has excellent speed, but is lacking truly devastating power. I don't rate him as highly as Goten. He can however launch attacks from quite long range and like all the small fighters in the game has fats in close moves. The Energy Piercer barrage of three fireballs is an effective move to abuse as well. BACKGROUND: This is Goku's first son. This captures him as he was during the Cell games saga. Arguably this was when Gohan was most powerful as he could fight with his emotions and had none of the doubts his older teenage self had. ------------------------------------------------------------------------- c) GOTEN ------------------------------------------------------------------------- \"A TRUE DOUBLE OF THE CHILD SUPER GOKU, HAPPY, LIVELY AND DYNAMIC... YOU REALLY ARE FULLOF ENERGY!\" BIO: \"Second son of SUPER GOKU and CHICHI, you are younger than your big brother but you have already become a Super Warrior, much like TRUNKS who is about the same age as you - true proof of your skills! Of course you are not that experienced so you attacks seem a little repetitive, but they are so effective! You know the technique of the KAMEHA-MEHA but you are best at close combat!\" SPECIAL MOVES Goten Attack D, u, square Rotating Kick b, cross Big Jumpkick db, uf, cross Rapid Sweep b, db, d, cross Energy Peircer qcf, circle Energy Converger B, f + circle Kameha-meha hcf, circle Giga-Kameha-meha qcb, f, circle STRATEGY: Definitely the best of the little fighters, even more so than Young Goku. Goten moves at incredible speeds, His special kick attacks all come out from a distance and hit multiple times. The Goten Attack sees Goten leap high in the air then torpedo down into an opponent at long range. In close his punches, kicks and other attacks will interrupt all but the fastest special moves. His small stature means some attack from tall characters like Super Bou, Likum and Cell will pass right over his head! BACKGROUND: This is Goku's second son. He is born soon after the Cell saga, sadly after Goku has died. He doesn't get to see Goku for seven years, until Goku comes back for a day visit from Otherworld just before the Buu saga kicks into gear. His best friend is Vegeta's son Trunks who he fuses with several times. ------------------------------------------------------------------------- d) TRUNKS ------------------------------------------------------------------------- \"YOU WILL NEVER BE BEATEN BY AN ADULT SO HIT THEM, HIT, THEM AND HIT AGAIN!\" BIO: \"VEGETA's blood runs through your veins. You have inherited your father's temper. You may only still be a child but you fight with the same pride and self-confidence as him! You are not afraid of those larger than you, on the contrary! You swoop down on your enemies, whatever their size and floor them with your SUPER ELBOW HIT or LIGHTENING KICK!\" SPECIAL MOVES Super Elbow Hit qcf, square Rotating Multi-Kick b, cross StepKick qcf, cross Lightening Kick B, f + cross Energy Peircer qcf, circle Aerial Energy Balls f, d, circle (while jumping) Unfolding Beam hcf, circle Hyper-Slide qcb, f, circle STRATEGY: Trunks plays like slightly inferior Goten. Many of his attacks are good, but no spectacular. His Aerial Energy Balls are especially disappointing due to the difficulty in targeting them. Stick with Goten or young Goku if you want and effective child fighter. BACKGROUND: This is Vegeta's son. He appears as a baby during the Android saga and is about a year older than Goten. He is a powerful fighter like his father and as stubborn as his mother Bulma. He is best friends with Goten, who he fuses with several times during the Buu saga. ------------------------------------------------------------------------- e) GOTRUNKS ------------------------------------------------------------------------- \"A FUSION OF TWO SUPER WARRIORS, YOU WOULD BE INVINCIBLE - IF ONLY YOU DIDN'T LET IT GO TO YOUR HEAD SO MUCH!\" BIO: \"TRUNKS and GOTEN can merge using a secret technique given to them by the inhabitants of Metamole. And this is the result: a super fighter who has TRUNK's attack strength and GOTEN's technique. You are so proud that you like to show off during combat and the names you have given your special moves prove how much you value them! They may seem extravagant, but with good reason: each one is very powerful. Block your opponent's movements and try to see the NTM MULTI MISSILES!\" SPECIAL MOVES Boar's Killer Attack f, d, square (while jumping) Prodigal Super Punch B, f + circle You're Dead Kick qcb, cross Super Brilliant Kick d, u, cross Three Beams of the Judge of Death qcf, circle Tabula Rasa Kameha-meha hcf, circle NTM Multi Missiles qcb,f, circle STRATEGY: Surprisingly Gotenks is a bit slower than Goten and trunks. Like his adult counterpart Gogeta, he disappoints as not really offering a spectacular improvement on the fighters he is based on. Many of his moves are tricky to pull off. Your best bet is to stick with close range attacks until you get a chance to back off and launch the admittedly powerful and impressive NTM Multi-Missiles. BACKGROUND: Better know as \"Gotenks\", this is a fusion resulting from the union of Trunks and Goten. This was performed under the tutelage of Goku then Piccolo during the middle of the Buu saga. Gotenks is hugely powerful, able to attain Super Saiyen 3 easily, and could have beaten Super Buu. But his youthful arrogance meant he ran of out time and the fusion wore off before he could deliver the killer blow. When he fused again, Buu absorbed him and became awesomely powerful. ------------------------------------------------------------------------- f) SUPER TRUNKS ------------------------------------------------------------------------- \"YOU CHARGE, YOU HIT! TERRIFY YOUR OPPONENTS, THEY HAVE NOWHERE TO HIDE!\" BIO: \"When FRIEZA and his father came to earth to seek vengeance, you suddenly appeared to destroy them with unexpected ease... When you were small, you were aggressive and foolish but now that you are an adolescent, you seem to have reached a certain maturity. You have endurance in combat and great mastery of movement that is not unlike SUPER GOKU. At mid-distance you are very powerful with your energy balls: an ENERGY JET or BURNING JET inflict serious damage on your opponent before you finish them off with a TERMINAL ASSAULT.\" SPECIAL MOVES Giga Footslide b, db, d, cross Descending Knee Hit hcb, cross Multiple Kick f, b, f, cross Energy Fog qcf, circle Energy Jet b, db, d, circle Burning Jet hcf, circle Terminal Assault qcb, f, circle STRATEGY: Pretty similar to Goku and Vegeta as you would expect. Plenty of speed and strength and a nasty attack in the form of the Energy Fog which fires blasts in all directions and is impossible to avoid. Although he lacks punching attacks, all three of his special kick attacks hit multiple times and should be mixed in with plenty of close range fisticuffs. BACKGROUND: Sometimes know as \"Future trunks\" or \"Mirai Trunks\" this is an incarnation of Vegeta's son Trunks from an alternative future. This version of Trunks comes from a future devastated by Androids 18 and 19. He travels back in time and destroys Freiza with little difficulty, then saves Goku's life and tries to create a better future by destroying the evil androids in the past. Unfortunately this has the unforeseen consequence of bringing Cell into being and Trunks has to stick around and help defeat him before returning to the future in his Capsule Corp time machine. ------------------------------------------------------------------------- g) PICCOLO ------------------------------------------------------------------------- \"DESTABLISE YOUR OPPONENT! LAUNCH SURPRISE ATTACKS FROM A DISTANCE!\" BIO: \"Great rival of SUPER GOKU and sensei of GOHAN, you are the greatest living Nameque fighter. You're relative slowness forces you to keep your distance and avoid close combat, but the power you can put into an assault is phenomenal. As hand-to-hand combat is not your speciality, you have developed a personal technique that allows you to keep your opponent at mid-distance and take them by surprise using your MYSTICAL JET or immobilise them using your UNFOLDING MYSTERY. You are master of several energy ball techniques. Do not hesitate to use your KILLER BEAM or your DEATH JET!\" SPECIAL MOVES Mystical Jet b, F + square Wing Kick f, d, cross (jump) Supersonic Kick f, b, f, cross Knee Uppercut db, uf, cross Energy Peircer qcf, circle Unfolding Mystery db, uf, circle Killer Beam hcf, circle Death Jet qcb, f, circle STRATEGY: Piccolo might be a little bit slow compared to some others but he has an awesome attack reach just with his standard punch and kick attacks making him ideal for pushing opponents back. Like the manual says, he excels and mid-to-long range fighting, with his Killer Beam and Death Jets being mega powerful attacks to finish an opponent off with. BACKGROUND: Piccolo is an alien from the planet Namek. Initially one Namek, he split into two parts, one good one evil. The good part became earths guardian, Kamesama. The evil part became King Piccolo who tried to destroy earth and was defeated by young Goku in the original Dragon Ball. This evil Piccolo gave birth to a new version who wasn't evil and actually became a mentor to Gohan and ally to Goku in DBZ. Eventually he fused with Kame to gain the power he needed to take on Cell in the middle of the Android saga. Originally a very powerful character, he became more of a teacher and advisor as the series progressed. ------------------------------------------------------------------------- h) KRILIN ------------------------------------------------------------------------- \"YOU ATTACK AND WITHDRAW WITHOUT GIVING YOUR OPPONENTS THE CHANCE TO REACT!\" BIO: \"Your strength and defence have a few weak points, and close combat is not your preferred method of battle. Thanks to your quick movements and technique, you always manage to keep your distance. Your continual coming and going eventually wears your opponents out. Annoy them! Then you can finish them of with a CIRCULAR JET!\" SPECIAL MOVES Senkouken qcf, square Shockwave Kick f, b, f, cross Gariou Kick b, db, d, cross Diving Kick f, d, cross (while jumping) Energy Piercer qcf, circle Reverse Kameha-meha qcf, circle Tayoken d, u, circle Kameha-meha hcf, circle Circular Jet qcb, b, circle STRATEGY: Krilin is a pretty good all-rounder. It's always going to be a war of attrition fighting with Krillin as he has no incredibly powerful moves. He does though, like Goku, possess the useful Tayoken which can be used to stun an opponent. Using this wisely will help swing the battle in your favour. His f/b square attack is hilarious! It looks like he is repeatedly punching his opponent in the crotch! BACKGROUND: Appearing first in Dragon Ball, Krilin is a Shaolin monk who trained alongside Young Goku under Master Roshi. He is a probably the most powerful human being in the series (he can fly and power up unlike Hercule). He was soon outstripped by the alien Saiyens and it was his death at the hands of Frieza that caused Goku to go Super Saiyen for the first time. By the time of the Buu saga, he is more of a family man having married and had a child with Former Android 18. ------------------------------------------------------------------------- j) TEN CHIN HAN ------------------------------------------------------------------------- \"YOU HAVE AN EXCELLENT DEFENCE AND HIGHLY TUNED TECHNIQUE. DO NOT GIVE YOUR OPPONENT THE CHANCE TO GET THROUGH. ATTACK!\" BIO: \"With training, you have reached a very high level of defence. This because you know very well that the strength of your normal attack is not great. I close combat, this is even more important. Effectively block the attack of your opponent and keep your distance with a MYSTERY RAY or TAYOKEN: you can then jump in with some powerful techniques such as the DESTRUCTIVE BREAKER or the CONVERGING BEAM. Make the most of your solid defences to make some decisive blows against your enemy: surprise them with your counter-attacks!\" SPECIAL MOVES Dragon's Mouth square (tap rapidly) Crossed Hit f, b, f, square Super Knee Uppercut qcf, cross Energy Piercer qcf, circle Mystery Ray db, uf, circle Tayoken d, u, circle Destructive Breaker hcf, circle Converging Beam qcb, circle STRATEGY: Very much similar tactics to Krillin. Use the Tayoken to stun opponents and follow up with a powerful energy attack. Also his Dragon's Moth is an excellent annoyance attack and can be abused for some serious health bar demolition if you are drawn into close combat. Better to keep people at arms length with Ki balls, Piercers and Mystery Rays. BACKGROUND: Another powerful human fighter from the original Dragon Ball series. As with Krillin he found himself outclassed by the Saiyens and went to train in solitude. Returning to confront Super Buu near the end of the Buu saga. ------------------------------------------------------------------------- k) GREAT SAIYAMAN ------------------------------------------------------------------------- \"BE A SUPER HERO! FIGHT FOR LOVE AND JUSTICE! SHOW THEM WHAT YOU'VE GOT!\" BIO: \"You are still at school! SO you have to fight behind this mask: neither VIDEL nor the others must know... But above all, you love wearing this get up! With varied techniques of a good level, GOHAN is not very strong in the attack. Our masked avenger does not have the experience of GOHAN... And in any case, not in manga or TV series. Luckily you are a good potential GOHAN. So forward, avenger!\" [Yes, I KNOW it makes no sense! I just quote what's there!!] SPECIAL MOVES Victory Uppercut qcf, square Super-Hero Punch f, b, f, square Wing Kick f, d, cross (while jumping) Double Avneger Kick qcf, cross Energy Direct qcf, circle Intergalactic Cannon b, F + circle Kameha-Meha qcb, f, circle STRATEGY: To be honest, pretty boring to fight with. No goofy attack that I would have expected him to have, basically plays like a poorer version of Goku. With Future Trunks included in the line-up I am surprised the chose the Saiyaman version of Gohan rather than Mystic Gohan from the Buu saga. Hey ho. Anyway, average all round, average speed, average strength, average moves. YAWN. BACKGROUND: This is teenage Gohan's alter ego. In the lull between the end of the Cell saga and before the threat of Majin Buu is realised, Gohan uses his Saiyen powers to play super hero. It is during this time he hooks up with Hercule's daughter Videl, who he teaches to fly and falls in love with. Eventually he and Videl have a daughter together, Pan. Who plays a significant role in Dragon Ball: GT. ------------------------------------------------------------------------- l) KAIOHSHIN ------------------------------------------------------------------------- \"YOUR MOVEMENTS ARE FAST: MAKE THE MOST OF THEM TO FOLLOW ONE ATTACK WITH ANOTHER!\" BIO: \"God of god's, you have come down to Earth to prevent the resurrection of MAJIN BOO. A single attack of yours is nothing special, but the speed and lightness of your legwork make it easy for you to run rings around your opponent like a butterfly and sting like a wasp. You sense danger? Stop the assault with your CIRCULAR DISENGAGEMENT! Block attacks with your IMMOBILIZATOR: the finish off your opponent with a jet and energy balls: QUADRUPLE GOD KICK or CRAZED ASSAULT? SPECAL MOVES Circular Disengagement f, d, f, square Crazed Assault b, F + square Quadruple God Kick hcf, cross Energy Piercer qcf, circle Immobilizator b, F + circle Shockwave b, db, d,, circle Energy Push hcf, circle God's Assault qcb, f, circle STRATEGY: Looks rather wimpy, but actually a pretty effective fighter both up close and long range. In close his Circular Disengagement and Crazed Assault are both multiple hitting nasty in close attacks. The God Kick can be activated from a distance and his various energy attacks are highly damaging and useful for pushing opponents back to a safe distance. He may look like a refugee from the 1981 Pop scene, but his speed and manoeuvrability make him a useful little fighter. BACKGROUND: Better known in the dubbed version as \"Supreme Kai\". He is one of the Gods, who comes down to earth to try and stop the resurrection of Majin Buu by wizard Babadi. He fails and has to return to Otherworld with Gohan to try a different approach. He ends up accidentally fusing with Kibito while experimenting with the Kai fusion earrings. ------------------------------------------------------------------------- m) VEGETA ------------------------------------------------------------------------- \"YOUR WIDE-RANGING TECHNIQUE GIVES YOU ENORMOUS DESTRUCIVE POWER! THEY ARE ALL WORMS COMPARED TO YOU!\" BIO: \"With the honour and pride of the royal blood that runs through your veins as prince of the Super Warriors, you have multiplied your training for a sole purpose: to gain a strength that will overcome SUPER GOKU! The various techniques you use are truly very powerful and few opponents will survive for long if you are allowed you inflict blow after super-powerful blow! Hit them with the HAMMER OF VEGETA or the KICK SLASH then punch and punch in a hand-to-hand combat!\" SPECIAL MOVES Super Elbow Hit qcf, square Hammer of Vegeta f, b, f, square Dive Slash f, d, cross (while jumping) Kick Slash db, uf, cross Explosive Breaker d, u, circle Ignivome Cannon qcf, b, circle Big Bang hcf, circle Terminal Slash qcb, f, circle STRATEGY: I actually prefer Vegeta as a fighter, over Goku in this game. Of all the fighters I think he has the best balance between short and long range attacks. The best mixture of energy and non-energy based moves and the best trade off between speed and power. Although his short little arms and legs give him a slight disadvantage with reach, his superb speed compensates fro this. The fact he can launch powerful assaults from all ranges makes it hard for people to form a defence against him. About the only downside is that the Hammer of Vegeta although powerful can miss some of the smaller fighters completely. BACKGROUND: Probably Dragon Ball Z's most interesting character. Vegeta arrives on earth early on in the Saiyen saga, to do what Goku failed to do, which is destroy it. After the rest of the Saiyen race is wiped out by Frieza, he and Goku (who he calls Cacarot) call a truce. Vegeta helps in the fight against the Androids and Cell and even marries Bulma and has a son, Trunks. This incarnation is Majin Vegeta. While trying to stop Buu being resurrected, Vegeta allows his proud heart to be manipulated by wizard Babadi and he gains extra power. He battles Goku before realising his Saiyen pride has allowed Buu to be resurrected. He self-destructs to try and kill Buu, but his sacrifice fails. He is however allowed by King Yamma to return to earth and fuse with Goku to defeat Super Buu... ------------------------------------------------------------------------- n) ZARBON ------------------------------------------------------------------------- \"YOU LIVE FOR THE BEAUTY OF THE FIGHT... YOURS! YOU ARE DEVOTED TO THE ART OF COMBAT: YOUR OWN!\" BIO: \"FRIEZA'S right hand man, you are a size to rival VEGETA but proud of your beauty, you cannot stand the idea of being hit in the face. Your special moves are aimed towards this vain obsession: powerful and magnificent, they are nonetheless limited if you rely on them alone. Use a clever mixture of normal techniques and close combat: that why, you will achieve the beauty of an efficient fight!\" SPECIAL MOVES Purple Circle d, u, cross Super Footslide b, db, d, cross Cosmic Energy Flash qcf, circle Pinkeye Breaker b, db, d, circle Star Hail hcf, circle Destructive Sphere qcb, f, circle STRATEGY: Not a very exciting character really. Decent speed and attack reach, but crippled by a small range of moves. Becomes rather repetitive to fight with and you'll have a hard time surprising an opponent after a couple of matches. BACKGROUND: A minor character in the series, he was Frieza's right-hand man and for the time in the series, very powerful. He was defeated by Vegeta when he underestimated the strength of the Saiyen genes. ------------------------------------------------------------------------- o) LIKUM ------------------------------------------------------------------------- \"YOUR ATTACKS ARE EXTREMELY DEADLY. NOTHING CAN STOP THEM!\" BIO: \"You are the strongest member of the GENIOUS commando! Although you have energy ball techniques such as your DELETER, you only show your true strength in close combat. Get near your opponent and grab them: then finish them off with a CRUSHER or a SPIN OF DEATH!\" SPECIAL MOVES Spin of Death hcb, square Crusher hcf, square High Kick db, uf, cross Likum Kick qcf, cross Super Pressure Kick f, d, cross (while jumping) Bomb Aggression hcf, circle Deleter qcb, f, circle STRATEGY: A pretty slow character and one that has a very hard time against some of the child fighters against whom he will often miss. Like most large, slow fighters his attacks have a lot of power, but its hard to get them to connect. Unlike the manual's recommendation it is better to keep him out of close combat. The best tactic is to wear the first layer of an opponents health bar down then try and destroy them with the hugely powerful Deleter move. BACKGROUND: Appeared early on in DBZ. One of Captain Ginyu's commandos better know as \"Recoome\" or \"Rikum\". He defeated Vegeta and nearly killed Gohan and Krillin. However he was easily beaten by Goku and finished off by Vegeta. ------------------------------------------------------------------------- p) GENIOUS ------------------------------------------------------------------------- \"COAX YOUR OPPONENT WITH YOUR ECCENTRIC POSES! THEY WILL NOT HAVE TIME TO REALISE YOUR TRUE POWER!\" BIO: \"You are leader of the commando that carries your name and that was the most powerful unit in FRIEZA's army. You have an extraordinary capacity to exchange your appearance with anyone who looks you in the eye. And although you spend your time adapting extravagant postures, your combat technique is more orthodox. A good fighter, you know how to combine hits, blocks and energy jets and you have no special fighting distance, making anybody a suitable opponent!\" SPECIAL MOVES Dynamite Punch qcb, f, square Cross Hit Surprise Tackle hcf, square Double Cycle Kick f, b, f, cross Energy Peircer qcf, circle Super Energy b, db, d, circle Floor Smash hcf, circle Genious Dynamite Attack qcb, f, circle STRATEGY: He has a range of pretty spectacular moves but these can be easily spotted and blocked by opponents if you overuse them. Tempting though it is to do so, you'll find yourself open to damaging counter attacks. Mix up attacking from all ranges, lots of in close poking to set up an opponent for a middle distance kick or punch attack or a long distance energy attack. BACKGROUND: Better know as \"Captain Ginyu\" he was the second strongest in the Universe after Frieza. This is before Goku powered up to full strength potential. He has had the strange ability to change bodies with a person by shooting a beam out of his mouth. He is not killed but tricked into swapping bodies with a frog. ------------------------------------------------------------------------- q) FRIEZA ------------------------------------------------------------------------- \"DISTANCE NO OBJECT! NEAR OR FAR, YOUR OPPONENT HAS NO CHANCE!\" BIO: \"A natural born killer, you want to overcome the entire universe. You have a slim body and you are so good at manipulating your tail like a whip that you can kill with one hit. You are also capable of attacking at terrifying speeds. In close combat, use your INFERNAL DIVES and TAIL HITS while at a distance, use the destructive power of the BALL OF DEATH or the MEGA DESTROYER! In any case, you are not disadvantaged at a distance! Your opponent will never have the chance to react!\" SPECIAL MOVES Frieza Head Breaker f, b, f, square Infernal Dive f, d, square (while jumping) Frieza Tail Hit qcb, cross Danger Cannon qcf, circle Energy Converger B, f + circle Explosive Breaker b, db, d, circle Frieza Ball of Death hcf, circle Frieza Mega Destroyer qcb, f, circle STRATEGY: As befits one of DBZ super villains Frieza can be pretty formidable, his long tail giving him a good long-range poke attack. He does have a lot of energy based attacks at his disposal and as usual gat to know how much energy these will drain to stop you being made vulnerable. The Head Breaker and Dive attacks are good for interrupting a building attack from an opponent. BACKGROUND: The first really badass villain to appear in DBZ. He is responsible for the destruction of the Saiyen race, which forces Vegeta to team up with Goku on the side of good. He changes form several times, gaining power with each transformation. He is defeated by Goku in an epic battle in space, but rebuilt by his father King Cold. They go to earth seeking vengeance, but Future Trunks appears and kills him easily. ------------------------------------------------------------------------- r) C18 ------------------------------------------------------------------------- \"YOU ARE GODDESS OF DESTRUCTION! YOU LAUNCH ONE ATTACK AFTER ANOTHER WITHOUT STOPPING!\" BIO: A cyborg designed by the mad Dr. Gelo, you live only to kill and destroy. Making your light bodyweight your advantage, you know how to efficiently make numerous attacks one after the other. At close range, you disarm your opponent with a number of kicking techniques. If a gap appears between you, however, you just aim at the legs with your energy jet to knock your opponent over. Use your speed and your opponent will be beaten before they know it.\" SPECIAL MOVES Flying Head Grab f, b, f, square Spin Kick b, db, d, cross Double Multi-Kick f, b, f, cross Energy Piercer qcf, circle Energy Jet b, db, d, circle Energy Ball hcf, circle Energy Breaker qcb, f, circle STRATEGY: Android 18 has a slight difference over the other fighters. Her energy bar replenishes much faster than the others, although she cannot do a fast power-up. In practice this means she can abuse energy based attacks much more freely than the rest. She definitely rewards a highly offensive strategy; keep up a barrage of Energy Jets and Balls, mixed up with her powerful fasts kicks. Keep your opponent on the ropes until you can finish them off with an Energy Breaker. BACKGROUND: Built by Dr. Jaro her and android 17 are responsible for the destruction of most of earth in Future Trunks timeline. However after she and Android 17 are absorbed by Cell, she is \"punched\" out of Cells body by Goku. Krillin has fallen for her and she for him and he wishes for the bomb that would cause her to self destruct to be removed from her. Being part human she is able to have a daughter with Krillin. She wins the Martial Arts Tournament, but allows Hercule to seem to win to avoid publicity and get more money. She is killed by Buu, but brought back at the end of the Buu saga along with everyone else who died. ------------------------------------------------------------------------- s) C16 ------------------------------------------------------------------------- \"YOUR ENTIRE BODY MADE OF REVOLUTIONARY TECHNOLOGY!\" BIO: \"16th Cyborg designed by Dr. Gelo, you are different from C17 and C18 in that you are only made of pure mechanics. Little attacks here and there make no mark on your hard exterior. You are and excellent attacker thanks to your strength. These advantages are somewhat compromised by a slight slowness of movement and your inability to turn around quickly. Use energy balls rather than hits: you are best at a distance! You have many energy jet techniques to play with, so keep your distance from your enemies and you will be most effective!\" SPECIAL MOVES Super-Power Direct Attack qcb, f, square Destructive Tackle b, db, d, square Fuse Punch qcf, square Hyper Cannon qcf, circle Laser Eyes db, uf, circle Energy Converger B, f + circle Mega Energy Bomb hcf, circle Hellfire qcb, f, circle STRATEGY: Like Android 18, Android 16 can constantly regenerate his energy bar at a fast rate. However, due to his size and slower speed he rewards a more defensive play. He has a lot of fast long distance attacks, such as the Fuse Punch and Hellfire can be devastating at close range. He is probably one of the best \"large\" fighters, easily better than Zarbon, Likum, Dabura or Genious. BACKGROUND: Another android built by Dr. Jaro designed only to target and kill Goku. However he turns against Cell who destroys him. He is rebuilt by Bulma and her father and tries to use his self-destruct against Cell in the Cell games. He fails leaving only his head, which is crushed by Cell. ------------------------------------------------------------------------- t) CELL ------------------------------------------------------------------------- \"YOUR NAME SPELLS FEAR! YOU HAVE REACHED PERFECTION: YOU ARE THE EMBODIMENT OF EVIL AND DESTRUCTION!\" BIO: \"A perfect Cyborg created from SUPER GOKU DNA, you also contain cells from PICCOLO and VEGETA, making you even more powerful; cells from C17 and C18 complete this picture of perfection... You have the perfect fighting body! You can use the five energy balls and jets at your discretion, making it easy to prevent any attack. But you are just as powerful in close combat with your height as you tower over most of your opponents.\" SPECIAL MOVES Head Attack f, b, f, square Grand Slide f, b, f, cross Climbing Attack db, uf, cross Energy Piercer qcf, circle Energy Converger B, f + circle Energy Direct Attack b, f, circle Giga Energy Breaker hcf, circle Kameha-meha qcb, f, circle STRATEGY: Well unsurprisingly Cell is a pretty formidable fighter! Like Piccolo, his long reach with standard kicks and punches make him dangerous up close and his battery of energy attacks are very damaging. Although like some of the other large fighters ha can have trouble against the child fighters who can get in under his defences. Compared with Super Buu and Freiza he is slower, so a more defensive style of play is suited to him. Push them back with your long arms and legs and whack 'em with a Kameha-meha! BACKGROUND: Cell is the perfect android built by Dr. Jaro. He contains the cells fo all the greatest fighters. In the future he kills Trunks and uses his Time Machine to travel back in time to before Androids 17 and 18 were destroyed so he can absorb them and become perfect Cell. He is defeated by Gohan after Gohan unleashes his rage at Cell killing his father Goku. ------------------------------------------------------------------------- u) DABURA ------------------------------------------------------------------------- \"WITH YOUR EVIL SWORD AND THE FLAMES OF HELL AS YOUR ALLIES, CONSUME ALL THOSE WHO DARE RESIST YOU!\" BIO: \"You are master of the Underworld and have come with BABIDI. You ate very difficult to reach and stand well above most warriors. And furthermore, you have a sword. Use it as a special weapon: attack without letting your opponent get to close! You can then use energy balls full of hellish flames! But beware! Your size becomes a problem if your opponent manages to get right up to you and make for your legs! In that case, you have one solution: use combinations of normal buttons for close combat (forwards/backwards + square)!\" SPECIAL MOVES Killer Spear qcf, square Double Spear qcf, cross Saraiba Breath B, f + circle Spear of Hell b, f, circle Energy Breath hcb, circle Ardent Shoot hcf, circle Flames of Death qcb, f, circle STRATEGY: Considering how much he kicked ass in the cartoon, Dabura here is rather disappointing. His Spear attacks are probably the most useless in the game often flying over even the tallest of opponents heads! Even the manual seems to sense his failings (see BIO quotes) and I can only concur with them in saying that to have a chance with Dabura you stay out of close range attack distance and try and get a spear hit in. When they are down to the yellow on their health bar try some Flames of Death and good luck! BACKGROUND: Dabura joins forces with Babidi to resurrect Majin Buu. However he soon realises Buu is a power that cannot be controlled and tries to kill him, Buu turns him into a biscuit. He ends up in the Otherworld and is not allowed down into Hell as he would enjoy it too much. He becomes good and aids Bulma, Chi Chi and Videl in searching for Gohan after Buu kills them. ------------------------------------------------------------------------- v) MAJIN BOO ------------------------------------------------------------------------- \"YOUR MISLEADING APPEARANCE HIDES AN INCREDIBLE GIGA-POWER! YOU ARE INVINCIBLE AT CLOSE RANGE!\" BIIO: \"Evil has been done, BABIDI has revived you! And although you look inoffensive, comical even, you have enough power inside you to destroy the entire world! Your normal techniques and special moves are incredibly powerful and you have many types of energy balls! Charge forward and finish off your opponent with a DESTROYER RAY.\" SPECIAL MOVES Burner b or f, square Majin Boo HeadButt db, uf, square Majin Boo Super HeadButt f, b, f, square Majin Boo Jumpkick f, d, cross (while jumping) Energy Splitter qcf, circle Energy Shot B, f + circle Destroyer Ray hcf, circle Majin Boo Breath qcb, f, circle STRATEGY: Big, fat and ANNOYING! Majin Buu has a big advantage in that he is extremely quick for a large fighter and enormously powerful with a large range of moves at his disposal. He also has a big disadvantage in that his huge bulk presents a target that is easy to hit. Attacks that may have missed a normal size opponent with connect with Fat Buu without fail. Buu works best in super offensive mode, his HeadButt and indeed his Butt head attack are quick and damaging. A lot of his attacks will floor an opponent, so learn to run his attacks in a string. He also has one of those handy energy attacks where they split off in all directions and are impossible to dodge. BACKGROUND: This is the version of Buu that is resurrected by Babidi. With the temprement of an inquisitive child he is ordered to be destructive by Babidi. He survives Vegeta's suicide attack and fights with Super Saiyen 3 Goku. He begins to question Babidi's orders and turns on the wizard and kills him. Soon he discovers that kindness brings new feelings to him and with the company of Hercule and Pete the dog he decides not to kill anymore. Sadly snipers kill Pete and Hercule, Buu brings them back to life, but is so angry that the anger manifests as another dark evil Buu. This Buu absorbs \"good\" Majin Buu and becomes Super Buu. However good Buu remains inside Super Buu, along with others Super Buu has absorbed. When Kid Buu tries to kill Hercule, Good Buu manages to escape from him and attacks him. Good Buu lives on after the destruction of Kid Buu, becoming part of Goku's gang. ------------------------------------------------------------------------- w) SUPER BOU ------------------------------------------------------------------------- \"THE PUREST AND GREATEST INCARNATION OF EVIL AND POWER, YOU LEAVE A TRAIL OF TERROR AND DESTRCUTION BEHIND YOU!\" BIO: \"You are evil personified, from the very worst parts of MAJIN BOO, you cannot walk straight, you stagger as if you were drunk... But all to surprise your opponent! You attacks are unpredictable and their power defies belief! You have very few special moves but no matter! Each one is incredibly powerful! You are master of attacking, defending and speed: and all-round winner and the most monstrous power in the Universe!\" SPECIAL MOVES Elastic Tentacle b, f, square Crazed Elbow Hit qcf, square Super-Energy Splitter qcf, circle Super-Destroyer Ray hcf, circle Super Bou Breath qcb, f, circle STRATEGY: Well, if you want to know who is the cheesy fighter in this game, here he is. Only a small number of moves, but all of them ludicrously strong. His long arms and legs give him great attack reach and he has amazing speed. Again being a tall fighter he can sometimes have trouble against the child fighters, but plenty of abuse of the elastic tentacle hit should keep annoying kids out of attack range. Basically, he rocks. BACKGROUND: This form of Buu results when Dark Buu absorbs Fat Buu. He is tremendously powerful and destroys the entire population of earth. He also kills Krillin, Bulma, Chi Chi etc He is nearly defeated by Gotenks and beaten badly by Mystic Gohan, but he manages to absorb Gotenks, Piccolo and Gohan to become an even more powerful version. After all those inside him are freed, including Fat \"good\" Buu he reverts to the original amoral Kid Buu the most destructive force ever. Only Goku with the power given to him by the people of earth could finally obliterate him. He was reincarnated in human form at the end of DBZ as a human boy called Ubuu. ========================================================================= ******************** 5) SECRET CHARACTER MOVELISTS ********************** ========================================================================= These aren't very secret characters, the code for unlocking them is in the manual simply tap in the following button commands quickly at the Title Screen: UP, TRIANGLE, DOWN, CROSS, LEFT, L1, RIGHT, R1 If you have done it correctly a \"pling\" noise will sound and you will get five new clips showing the new characters in action. Then the title screen will read \"Ultimate Battle 27\" for the duration of your session. This cannot be saved, so each time you load up the game, you must do this to access the characters. ------------------------------------------------------------------------- a) GENIUS TURTLE ------------------------------------------------------------------------- BIO: \"Genius Turtle, master of all tortoises, knows all sorts of special attacks. When he unleashes his ELEPHANT PUNCH from behind, followed by a DRUNKEN TORTOISE PUNCH, you need to be very lucky to survive! He also uses various long-distance attacks such as the MAXI KAMEHA-MEHA and the MEGA-DISCHARGE!\" SPECIAL MOVES Two Level Knee Hit f, b, f, cross Drunken Tortoise False Punch qcf, square Drunken Tortoise False Kick qcf, cross Elephant Punch f, df, d, square Teleport f, b, f, square Kameha-meha hcf, circle Mega Discharge hcb, circle Maxi Kameha-meha qcb, f, circle STRATEGY: He may like old, but Master Roshi has a few tricks up his sleeve, don't forget it was him who taught Goku the technique of the Kameha-meha! He is unable to fly, but he can use Ki power to devastating effect. You are probably better of not using his false kicks and punches to much as they telegraph themselves and only hit at very close range. No you are far better off abusing his teleport move to get in close behind an opponent and throw them. You can use a throw to set up a Kameha-meha attack. If you can pull off the Maxi Kameha-meha it will demolish an opponents health bar, but also drain Turtles power bar severely so make sure you aren't left panting a vulnerable. It unlikely opponents will fly much when fighting you except to recharge, so learn to pimp them with energy blasts if they do. BACKGROUND: Better known in the US dubbed DBZ series as \"Master Roshi\". Apart from Goku this is one of Dragon Ball's longest running characters (Bulma being the other). He first appears early on in the original Dragon Ball series, tagging along with Goku and Bulma as they search for the Dragon Balls. Later on he trains Goku and remains part of the gang usually found first at Kame House, then at the Lookout. ------------------------------------------------------------------------- b) GOKU ------------------------------------------------------------------------- BIO: \"The various attack techniques of Goku have very nice names linked with the attack techniques that he used when he was young and innocent but, like Super Goku himself now, these attacks are ferocious! Goku's speciality is close combat so attack your opponent with the FLYING KAMEHA-MEHA while approaching them then finish them with the FIST OF FURY! Goku also uses the TWISTING STICK attack.\" SPECIAL MOVES Fists of Fury hcf, square Magic Stick B, f + square Flying Kameha-meha f, d, square (while jumping) Stone b, f, square Scissors b, f, cross Paper b, f, circle Kameha-meha hcf, circle Directed Kameha-meha qcb, f, circle STRATEGY: This little Goku is very bit as tough and powerful as his older self. He is my favourite character in the whole game to fight with! To begin with his small size gives him an advantage similar to the other child fighters, being awesome in close. His Throw (b or f and square) is a wonderfully fast interruption move and if any slower characters are powering up a super move you can grab and throw them easily. His square + cross move, spins his stick extremely fast. As well as extinguishing standard energy balls, this also hits multiple times at close range making it another good annoyance attack. The throw can be used to set up more complicated moves. While they recover you have time to input the commands for the Flying Fists, Magic Stick and the Stone, Paper, Scissors moves. Or to give you time to flee/fly and charge up. The stone, paper, scissors moves seems slow and ineffective at first but can be used tactically. Once he has made the first two \"chants\" he will slide quickly forward and strike hard. As he slides, attacks will pass through him. Of course it is an easily spotted attack, and you will be left vulnerable if your opponent hops back out of reach. So timing is all. The flying Kameha-meha is easy to pull off, but damn hard to hit with, you'll often overshoot or undershoot or even go in the wrong direction. But if your opponent is one who likes to jump or fly a lot this is a good one to get them with. The Kameha-mehas remain a gamble as always, is it worth the energy drain and the fact it is quite obvious when they are being powered up? Young Goku can have trouble against any opponent that has mastered the arts of pushing opponents back out of close range and so much of Gokus attack arsenal is orientated around close quarter combat. Then it becomes imperative you learn how to use the rock, paper, scissors moves to slide through attacks and get into the opponents face again. BACKGROUND: This is Goku as he first appeared as a child in the original Dragon Ball manga and anime series. This is prior to the DBZ series and prior the revelation he was really an alien from the Saiyen race. He is basically a monkey-tailed boy who under the apprenticeship of Master Roshi develops strong energy based martial arts moves including the Kameha-meha. He cannot fly yet under his own power, so has a magic cloud. This is similar to the hero of the popular \"Monkey\" Japanese TV show of the 1970's, which in turn was based on old Chinese myths of the monkey hero. He is sometimes referred to in other Dragon Ball games as \"Chibi Goku\". ------------------------------------------------------------------------- c) MEGA GOKU ------------------------------------------------------------------------- BIO: \"The third transformation, the final and strongest form ever taken on by Goku has devastating kicking attacks. His DOUBLE FORWARD FLIP attack is almost unbeatable! Mega Goku is one of the strongest warriors with some of the fastest special attacks!\" SPECIAL MOVES Hyper Elbow Hit qcf, square Double Wing Kick f, d, cross (while jumping) Forward Flip qcb, f, cross Backflip qcf, b, cross Double Forward Flip hcf, cross Energy Converger B, f + circle Kameha-meha qcf, circle Giga Kameha-meha qcb, f, circle STRATEGY: I find Mega Goku to be more effective in battle than Gogeta to be honest. He plays as you would expect; Goku with more power. Like Goku he favours kick based attacks, all of which can be activated from considerable distances. His multi-hitting flip kicks can be especially devastating. Even his basic attacks, the Elbow and Wing Kick hit multiple times allowing devastating strings of attacks to be built up. BACKGROUND: Better know as \"Super Saiyen 3 Goku\" this ultra powerful form of Goku came into play during the Buu saga. After Buu had been released and was starting his trail of destruction Goku powered up to Super Saiyen level 3 and fought him. At that point it is possible he could of defeated Buu, but he chose not to. The strain of maintaining the form drained his energy significantly and he had to return to the Otherworld early. ------------------------------------------------------------------------- d) GOGETA ------------------------------------------------------------------------- BIO: \"Gogeta is really the strongest of all warriors - Goku and Vegeta rolled into one! His attacks, from TELEPORT to energy discharges such as FINAL KAMEHA-MEHA are irresistible! If you cannot beat Gogeta, keep training... SPECIAL MOVES Gogeta Super Kick d, db, b, cross Perforating Spinner f, b, f, cross Wing Kick f, b, f, cross (while jumping) Converging Breath B, f + circle Teleport L1, qcf, circle or square or cross Ultra Super Donuts hcf, circle Final Kameha-meha STRATEGY: Feh, considering the power of the fusion technique, Gogeta is less impressive than you might expect. He as similar power and speed to Goku, Vegeta etc but a surprising lack of really effective offensive moves. His perforating spinner is easily avoided, the donots take too long to power up and the Kameha-meha although very damaging drains almost a full energy bar leaving Gogeta often vulnerable. However his one strength os his excellent Teleport move. Using this to confuse and dodge attacks at great speed you can attack in close with his powerful standard kicks and punches. BACKGROUND: This is another fusion of Vegeta and Goku. Although they fused using the Kai's earrings in DBZ, this resulted in a character called \"Vegetto\". This fused character was a result of a fusion dance, and occurs in one of the Dragon Ball films. This fusion is said to favour Goku, while Vegetto is said to favour Vegeta. ------------------------------------------------------------------------- e) MR SATAN ------------------------------------------------------------------------- BIO: \"Mr Satan seems like an ineffective champion as he can neither fly nor charge but don't be fooled. Mr Satan is the strongest and most feared of the long-distance fighters and he unleashes a devastating rain of grenades, mortars and missiles!\" SPECIAL MOVES Rolling Attack b, db, d, square Volcanic Sting qcb, square Fearful Fist qcf, square Dynamite Kick qcf, cross Satan Special Grenade circle Satan Special Bazooka hcf, circle Megatron Special Mortar qcb, f, circle Megatron Special Mortar Misfire qcg, hcf, circle Four-Missile Launch hcb, f, circle STRATEGY: Well he can't fly, or use Ki, but the fact he has no energy draining attacks actually makes him one of the best fighters in the game. He has a huge range of powerful, long range attacks and can use them over and over with no need to recharge! Abuse his grenades to keep opponents pushed back and use his missiles and mortars against those who try and fight you from the air. If you can activate the Four-Missile Launch it's pretty much game over for your opponent as it does do much damage. If you can keep the smaller quicker fighters out of arms reach the slower activation time of ost of your big attacks should be no problem! BACKGROUND: Better known to fans of the US dub version of DBZ as \"Hercule\". A bit of a comedy character he has no special powers at all. He first crops up at the beginning of the Cell Games storyline in the Android Saga. He carries on as regular character through the Buu Saga and also appears in Dragon Ball GT. He is the strongest human being (who cannot use Ki power) alive however and despite his bragging and boasting he accomplishes some very brave things. He almost succeeds in turning Majin Bu from evil through his kindness and without him Goku would never have been able to destroy Kid Buu at the end of the DBZ saga. Despite knowing it would be suicidal he attacks Super Buu to try and prevent him killing Gohan, whom his daughter Videl is in love with. He attacks Kid Buu and stops him choking Vegeta to death. His \"cowardice\" is really only his commonsense realisation that he is not in the same league as the Saiyen fighters and their foes. So even though he is full of bluster, he has the heart of a warrior just like Goku, Gohan and the rest. Respect to Hercule! ========================================================================= ************************** 6) BUILD UP MODE ***************************** ========================================================================= Build Up mode allows you to take a character and raise its levels of power by using certain moves over and over and fighting through five blocks of opponents. If you wish to use one of the secret characters then make sure you have entered the code for \"Battle 27\" before you go into the select character option. In future games if you go straight to Build Up Mode and load a secret character. Once you quit the mode, you'll find the game has defaulted to \"Battle 27\" without you needing to have entered the code. ------------------------------------------------------------------------- a) BUILDING A CHARACTER ------------------------------------------------------------------------- Building a character is a long process and in all fairness can get a little tedious. If you are playing alone the pay-offs against the CPU aren't very satisfying, it really comes in to its own if you have a friend who has built a character up to the same level. Pitting two built up fighters tailored to your own strengths is a lot of fun! To start with if you want to build up one of the five secret characters, make sure you have entered the \"Battle 27\" code. Now you can select a character to fight with. Once you choose, the five secret characters will disappear from the line-up (except obviously the one you are if you chose one) and you'll see that you are now Level 00. You'll see that each of the characters are a Level. Saiyaman being the lowest at Level 1 and Goku highest at level 22. Each time you fight and defeat a character you will gain their level. So if you beat Saiyaman you'll become level 01. You don't have to battle in order. You can jump to fighting Dabura at Level 09 and if you defeat him you'll jump to Level 09! You must defeat everyone, including yourself in each block. At the end of the block, the Boss will appear. If you choose to beat that Boss you'll automatically progress to the next block of fighters. Think carefully each time you are about to move on. If you need to build up more moves refight lower level characters, as there is no going back to earlier blocks once they are passed. Levelling up also gives you more health on your health bar, the higher the level the more health you have. As you progress in fights the more you use a particular move the more powerful it will get. I am not 100% certain how the move strengthening works, but it appears that if you use the move as your \"killer blow\" it will get stronger. You can tell when it has powered up and when you impact the blow a fire effect will blossom and that effect gets bigger as you power up. The temptation is to power up one move to very high levels, but it is recommended you build up a range of moves and the CPU gets better at blocking your repeated attacks in the third, fourth and fifth blocks. You health bar will acquire a light blue layer and a purple layer as your fight through the first two blocks. However by block three things start getting a bit strange. In fights the both of you will land blows that initially do no damage, even the super-powered ones. After a few blows have been landed the energy will start coming off in greater amounts. I am not sure why this is, seems to be compensation for not adding any more layers to the health bar. So you need to attack even more frenziedly as higher-level opponents will be able to land damaging blows before you can! My general advice is to pick a character you are comfortable with and the moves you can perform the best. For example I chose Young Goku. I concentrated on his in-close grab, his stick spin and his directed Kameha-meha. As he is such a good and fast in-close fighter he quickly became very effective. A move that hits multiple times is a good one to build up as they can be devastating. His stick spin could take down two layers of health bar by the third level! Finally you can save characters to a memory card in slot one of the psx. Each character will take up one block each. It's worth saving even if you lose as you still gain a little power. Also take a look at the icons on the memory manager sometime; some of them are really cute! ------------------------------------------------------------------------- b) LEVELLING UP ------------------------------------------------------------------------- This is basically a chart of the character levels through the five blocks you need to fight through. Goku, Genius Turtle, Mega Goku, Gogeta and Mr. Satan all appear as Bosses. Once you have fought all the characters and won (including whoever you are playing as) a Boss character will appear. Beat them to access the next block and they will be added to the roster of fighters who need defeating in the next block. Block 1 Block 2 Block 3 Block 4 Block 5 Great Saiyaman 1 24 48 73 99 Kaiohshin 2 25 49 74 100 Goten 3 26 50 75 101 Little Trunks 4 27 51 76 102 Ten Chin Han 5 28 52 77 103 Zarbon 6 29 53 78 104 Krilin 7 30 54 79 105 Genious 8 31 55 80 106 Dabura 9 32 56 81 107 Likum 10 33 57 82 108 Super Trunks 11 34 58 83 109 C18 12 35 59 84 110 Gohan 13 36 60 85 111 Majin Boo 14 37 61 86 112 Gotrunks 15 38 62 87 113 C16 16 39 63 88 114 Freiza 17 40 64 89 115 Piccolo 18 41 65 90 116 Cell 19 42 66 91 117 Vegeta 20 43 67 92 118 Super Bou 21 44 68 93 119 Super Goku 22 45 69 94 120 Goku 23 46 70 95 121 Genius Turtle -- 47 71 96 122 Mr. Satan -- -- 72 97 123 Mega Goku -- -- -- 98 124 Gogeta -- -- -- -- 125 REMINDER: Once you beat the Boss of each block you cannot return to previous blocks, so make sure you have spread the development of your moves about, or you may find it hard to win as the CPU will learn to defend against a single powerful move and the rest will do no damage. ------------------------------------------------------------------------- c) CARRYING DATA OVER TO DRAGON BALL: FINAL BOUT ------------------------------------------------------------------------- If you possess a copy of Dragon Ball Final Bout in the same format (ie. Both UK PAL or both Japanese NTSC) you can carry your built up character from DBZUB22 into Final Bout. However in practice this is very limited. Only a few characters appear in both games, eg. Vegeta, Goku, Cell, Freiza. And many of the moves are different to those in DBUB22. If you have a character built up like C18 or Mr. Satan who does not appear in Final Bout you can convert the data into one of the Final Bout characters. To be honest, it doesn't seem to make much noticeable difference. If you can't be bothered building up a character in Final Bout it gives you the chance to make a one up from the more enjoyable Battle 22. But don't be fooled into thinking you'll see your 2D Battle 22 character reborn in glorious 3D. To do this anyway you should put your memory card with your chosen DBZUB22 character saved onto in slot one of the psx and load up Dragon Ball: Final Bout. Go into Build Up Mode and choose the conversion option. If you have more than one character saved on the card, it will allow you to choose which one then which Final Bout character you want the data converted into. It will then save your new Final Bout character in a different file.
