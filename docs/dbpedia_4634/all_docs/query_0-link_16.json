        "text": "Characters & Voice Actors\n\nStaff\n\nEdit\n\nOpening Theme\n\n\"We Gotta Power\" by Hironobu Kageyama\n\nEdit\n\nEnding Theme\n\n\"Saikyou no Fusion\" by Hironobu Kageyama\n\nReviews\n\nWhen it comes to the Dragonball films in general they usually follow something different. instead of the canon material that the series contains\n\nIt instead mixes certain content from the series themselves but only to present a different setting that usually is not always direct from the series.\n\nSo therefore, Do not go into watching them expecting anything that great of a premise in the first place since its not meant to do so, except just take them as special added content for its standard viewing alone.\n\nSo on to the 12th Dragon Ball Z Movie and I totally loved it!!\n\nThis surprised me because I didn't have that ... much expectations of it and yet as soon as I started watching it, It starts to go with the action and comedy formula right of the bat and it works so well for this film.\n\nThe action is fun, You get your silly slapstick moments of the characters, some bizarre real life character references like hitler in this like wtf xD, as well as fusion from the series.\n\nThe animation looks brilliant for a mid 90s movie along with its fights as well which was pretty memorable in terms of how epic it looks.\n\nThe voice acting was fine on both in English and Japanese, Though I like more of the soundtracks from the english version since Gogeta and Janemba's theme sounds really cool.\n\nThe villain here Janemba who doesn't have any personality what so ever is this manifestation of evil negative energy similar to majin buu in terms of having a primal like personality starting his form as this giant oversized child like thingy than shortly enough into this sinister looking demon which I have to admit the design of it looks brilliant.\n\nJanemba also possesses a pretty incredible ability of materialising and manipulating space and anything over the dimensions of space itself making him capable of transforming the universe in its entirety into his image which includes the Other World where goku is fighting pikkon.\n\nThese effects causes the other world and their overseers including the checking station to falter in this dimension making the villains escape from their confinement.\n\nNot only that but the magic of the dragonballs are also effected by this as well.\n\nThe movie's main plot is mainly about goku, vegeta and the others trying to stop the powerful janemba and his powers over the dimensions that pulls in some of these entertaining moments out really well.\n\nThe only thing I wished to have seen more of was janemba effecting other parts of the universe and for the other villains though only minor, to be a little more involved in the movie to at least make the film a little more longer but other than that, this movie was fun and enjoyable and Gogeta totally rocks!!\n\nIts probably my favourite dragonball film so far ;)\n\nReviewer’s Rating: 9\n\nWhat did you think of this review?\n\nNice 0\n\nLove it 0\n\nFunny 0\n\nConfusing 0\n\nInformative 0\n\nWell-written 0\n\nCreative 0\n\nShow all\n\nI've talked about Toriyama Akira's Dragonball and I've talked about the Dragonball Z: Battle of Gods movie. Now it's time to delve into the franchise once more with a look at the twelfth Dragonball Z movie, Fusion Reborn. Will it be on the level of the fourteenth movie or is this one of the weak Dragonball Z films?\n\nStory:\n\nOur story opens after the Buu saga with an afterlife tournament where Goku faces off against Paikuhan, in spite of the fact that Goku was resurrected by the old Kaio during the Buu saga and the fact that the grand Kaio decided that the prize for the afterlife ... tournament needed to be withheld for a while so he could get back in shape. Unsurprisingly, this is a Dragonball Z movie that doesn't fit in with the continuity, which is an issue with a lot of them. Moving on, King Yama is busy judging souls while the oni in charge of monitoring the soul cleansing equipment goofs off. This results in an accident which causes the evil to burst out and transform the young oni into Janemba, a being of pure evil that seals Yama's palace, enabling the souls of the dead to break free and roam around on Earth. The tournament is postponed so that Goku and Paikuhan can investigate.\n\nTo be fair, the concept behind this isn't a bad one. The idea of the dead wreaking havoc could have been very interesting. But this is DBZ so it's used as an excuse for action sequences and that's pretty much it. To be fair, that's pretty much to be expected from the franchise and it's what people are going to be watching the film for. That's why the biggest problem is the final fight itself. It is really anti-climactic. You get some good buildup for it, but the fight itself ends in about thirty seconds. Mr. Satan fought Cell longer than Gogeta fights Janemba. On the positive side, the film does have some funny moments and some stupidly awesome bits, including Trunks and Goten fighting undead nazis.\n\nCharacters:\n\nThe film focuses primarily on the saiyajin and half saiyajin characters. Goku, Vegeta, Gohan, Trunks and Goten. Videl also plays a somewhat significant role. None of them really develop in any substantial way over the course of the film, but you do get a good sense of their personalities, which is fair enough given that the film isn't even an hour long. Then we have our villain, Janemba. He's basically like Majin Buu right down to starting as an obese man-child and transforming into a meaner, more heavily muscled form. It's like the Frieza and Cooler thing where a film just makes a weaker copy of a villain from the main series.\n\nArt:\n\nThe artwork and animation are pretty decent. The biggest issue is that the action sequences are kind of weak in this one. Given how much the franchise relies on those, that's pretty bad. I will give the film credit for having some really interesting backgrounds during its tour of hell.\n\nSound:\n\nThe entire vocal cast delivers decent performances. There's some exaggeration, but no more than the usual given the franchise's tendency to have dudes screaming to get stronger. The music is pretty good.\n\nHo-yay:\n\nThere isn't any homo-eroticism in this movie.\n\nFinal Thoughts:\n\nDragonball Z: Fusion Reborn is an action movie with some good ideas and funny moments, but that suffers from weak action and a boring antagonist. It isn't a bad movie, nor is it one of the worst DBZ films for what it is, but there are a lot of better Dragonball Z films out there. This one is just kind of dull. My final rating for it is going to be a 5/10. Tomorrow I'll take a look at Spirited Away.\n\nReviewer’s Rating: 5\n\nWhat did you think of this review?\n\nNice 0\n\nLove it 0\n\nFunny 0\n\nConfusing 0\n\nInformative 0\n\nWell-written 0\n\nCreative 0\n\nShow all\n\nThis fits in nicely with my theory that the Dragon Ball Z movies are getting sh*ttier with each new addition. \"Fusion Reborn\", being one of the last ones as far as I can tell, manages to hit a new low.\n\nI must have missed something in one of the earlier Dragon Ball Z movies that I didn't watch, for in this one, all the characters from the old generation such as Goku and Vegeta appear to be dead. Either that or this movie is meant to be set in the far future relative to the other movies... who knows, it's probably too much to expect Dragon ... Ball Z to make much sense anyway.\n\n\"Fusion Reborn\" is an incredibly boring movie. But what's more incredible is that they somehow manage to stretch the nothingness of the content into almost an hour long film when there have been other Dragon Ball Z movies that's got more content that are shorter. I watched through most of \"Fusion Reborn\" in a kind of trance as one of the most bizarre story lines I've ever watched took place in front of my eyes. They appear to be going for some sort of original, comical storyline, and the result isn't pretty. Dragon Ball always seemed to be quite a childish franchise, but this one takes it down to a brand new level: Hell, or whatever that place is, gets frozen in some sort of jelly bean, with a big baby as boss for Goku and Vegeta to battle... what the F*CK? Although I have to admit I chuckled at some of the comedy, like the fusion poses, most of this movie is pure sh*te.\n\nOther than that part of the storyline, which is different but worse, the rest of the anime is mostly standard Dragon Ball Z fare. The animation is typically mediocre - although at least there's none of the usual fast exchanges of punches/kicks style fighting that I hate so much, the voice acting is typically rubbish (although the music used is okay), and again they managed to collect 7 dragon balls and summon the dragon Shen Long. That creature is seriously starting to lose its novelty value due to appearing so frequently.\n\nI appreciate that they appear to have tried something different from the usual Dragon Ball, but unfortunately the result is something that's worse.\n\nReviewer’s Rating: 3\n\nWhat did you think of this review?\n\nNice 0\n\nLove it 0\n\nFunny 0\n\nConfusing 0\n\nInformative 0\n\nWell-written 0\n\nCreative 0\n\nShow all\n\nInterest Stacks\n\nRecommendations\n\nRecent News\n\nRecent Forum Discussion\n\nRecent Featured Articles\n\n10 Anime and Manga about Fighting Nazis\n\nThe rise of neo-Nazi groups around the world has been terrifying.
