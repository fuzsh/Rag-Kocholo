list. We’ve included step-by-step instructions for the easiest way below.\n\nClose Dragon Ball Legends\n\nDelete all game data from your phone\n\nYou can do this by heading to Settings – Apps – Dragon Ball Legends – Clear data\n\nOpen Dragon Ball Legends again, complete the tutorial and try to summon again\n\nHow do I get new Dragon Ball Legends characters?\n\nDespite being around a few years, new characters arrive on our Dragon Ball Legends tier list all the time. Still, if you want to add them to your roster, there are only two ways to go about it. Some characters are given away as free rewards, while others you need to summon.\n\nWhen it comes to summoning, you have the option of either using gems, the in-game premium currency you can buy with your own money, or tickets, which you earn for completing objectives. Fortunately, Dragon Ball Legends is one of the more generous gacha games, and you can often rely on tickets to unlock a few solid characters without opening your wallet."
