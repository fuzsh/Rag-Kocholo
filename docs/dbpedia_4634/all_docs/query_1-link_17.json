        "text": "Post by drewsaga on\n\nGoku vs Uub is done, talking about Vegeta vs Cell is getting old, might as well wait until Vegeta and Cell actually get more serious, Bra vs Gast might be interesting but that's going to be a while after.. But one fight I wanna talk about is the next one, Zen Buu vs XXI (of course we could wait then too but you never know, the fight might be brief and not actually be a fight). Probably the most terrifying matchup since Vegetto vs Broly. But how the hell is XXI suppose to even be able to beat Zen Buu?\n\nFrom what we know, his powers are limited too, it depends on the Dragon Balls (which his balls are inert) and I think XXI needed another two hours to recharge he said and I doubt it's been two hours in DBM since he said that. But Zen Buu's is almost limitless, Buu can teleport (both with IT and IM), he can place pieces all over the place, he is crazy powerful, he has crazy high stamina, he regenerates on a molecular level, likely has super intelligence with the amount of people he absorbed (in the Novel he discovered Cold Fusion while Gohan is still working on that), Zen Buu already knows how XXI fights and if I were Zen Buu, I'd go for the immediate knockout before he dared do something crazy on the off chance. XXI has almost ZERO advantage over Zen Buu (maybe his magic abilities are better but Buu is no stranger to magic neither and likely is also proficient at it (in the U4 Novel, he also went to Icaron and even absorbed the Dragon Balls as well as it's creator) and MANY disadvantages.\n\nLogically it seems like Zen Buu winning the whole tourney is too obvious and XXI is gonna have to asspull even worse than Vegeta does against Cell to actually win. Yet somehow we (even I to some extent) expect XXI to win (I think XXI winning would be more interesting anyways only because Buu's abilities are through the roof in all fields). I know Vegetto also could have quickly tried knocking XXI out but Vegetto chose to dialogue in his head, not having any idea what XXI would try doing. Maybe Buu toys around with XXI thinking he is above it all and that's how Buu loses (similar to what I expect from Vegeta against Cell where Cell would get too cocky).\n\nRight before getting to XXI, only Gast was able to beat Zen Buu, the same guy who turned off SSJ3 Vegetto with magic! I say as impressive as XXI's magic abilities are Gast so far has him beat. And XXI might not even be physically as strong as U9 Yamcha for all we know. If XXI has a large physical disadvantage over the rest of the competitors, even Goku and Vegeta could be a problem if they just teleport and slap him upside the head and Gast and Zen Buu excel at both magic and power (though Gast excels less at power and probably more at magic).\n\nXXI's feats so far is teleporting somebody (Vegetto) to an inverse-HTC dimension (Vegetto broke free anyways granted he lost) and turning off #18. I wonder what's more impressive, turning off #18 by summoning a deactivation switch (though I won't pretend it wasn't shocking) or Gast deactivating and crippling Vegetto and Zen Buu (the two powerhouses of DBM besides Broly who left the universe) with magic? I suppose XXI, much like Vegeta is another character whose abilities are unknown, except XXI is much more unknown than Vegeta's. But XXI is actually gonna have to prove his worth as a main villain because so far he hasn't.\n\nXXI looks like an intimidating and terrifying villain (in his Eldritch Horror form), Zen Buu actually is terrifying and intimidating even for the best fighters/warriors/magic users/anyone in general.\n\nPost by Super-dee-Duper Veku on\n\nAlready been touched on by a few others and been a theory for years but I do think the old man form/puppet of his really is just a ploy to make XXI seem weaker or even like a different character from what we he truly is. Zen Buu stumbling onto his potentially OG form and his “what power” statement aside, the fact that old Kai freaked out about him when he heard the name must imply something. Wasn’t until the old Kai saw him (old man form) that he stopped being worried and said the name must just be a coincidence. The reason potentially being that he’s only disguised himself to such a degree to hide his true identity from the Kais for now. Him not revealing too much of his true power or real abilities could have more meaning behind it then just being a smart tournament battle strategy imo. Having XXI out plan and be steps ahead of everyone as he’s been left out of all the major drama that’s happened and is currently occupying the other characters mind and actions. With him even outsmarting Zen Buu who’s been shown to be the master planner of this comic so far, would be an interesting turn of events. He is after all forgotten about quite often by the main cast of the tournament, giving him plenty of time to be left to his own devices and to come up with whatever plan he really has.\n\nIf he’s truly some ancient big bad, he’s most likely dealt with and killed Kais in his universe. If the way old Kai acted when he first heard his name announced is anything to go by anyway. Also potentially why Grand Supreme Kai and Zen Buu seem to be working together. The Kai trying to figure out what XXI truly is and Buu just being himself and obsessed with gaining more strength/ knowledge to improve regardless, his curiosity and playful attitude being his downfall for once this time. Maybe he counters the old mans magic in their fight, playing with him to see what he’s capable of as he has done so with in his previous fights. Biting off more than he can chew this time. XXI is forced to reveal more of his real self/power to deal with him. This leading to him confirming who he really is to the Kais and Buu gets another opportunity to face a truly formidable foe again. It ending with Buu getting more than he bargained for and being beat or most likely resealed. And maybe even XXI dropping his act completely to set the stage for all hell to really break loose.\n\nXXI planning ahead as he often does and trying to rely on a sealing spell at first would be in total character from what we’ve seen. Doing his best to stay in disguise because he knew there would be Kai’s present at the tournament and didn’t want to take the chance of being recognized if my theory is correct. Him or it most likely thinking that they may be aware of who his true self is in other universes, not wanting to take any chances of the Kais considering him too dangerous and attempting to do something about him proactively like having him sent back home. (Especially with how these Kais treat potential threats let alone major ones) so if the old Kai were to inform them of who he really is it could potentially ruin his plans.\n\nMost likely as others have already said, he’ll end up using the sealing spell first to take Buu out as fast as possible, though I do hope their fight lasts longer and isn’t just a few pages. With Buu exposing more of who XXI really is because of him having to reveal more of his true self to be able to counter such an OP magical character as this Buu. Exposing his real super duper evil self and finally revealing what he is it to the Kais, with them not allowing him to make his wish if he wins. Leading to the scenario of everyone left being forced into stepping up to try and stop him if he’s finally had enough and drops the act. Starts causing shit and just taking what he wants or even causes Vegettos rampage somehow (though after the Majin rebellion arc, anymore magical brainwashing like this sounds a little too samey and obvious but maybe). Why they end up breaking a dragon ball like in Bardocks vision, to try and stop him from getting his wish at any cost.\n\nHim also sealing or even killing Buu would take him out of the way for that Vegetto rampage we were teased if it really does still happen. Buu being one of the very few that could challenge or even match Vegetto if he snaps. Him not being around for that would allow it to all play out easier with no one to really challenge Vegetto, especially if something happens to Gast before then as well. Buus also been set up as this all powerful and unstoppable magical character for so long now. Having XXI behind the scenes out plan and beat Buu, could shake his god complex some and take him down a peg or two. Similar to what has already happened to Vegetto in a way.\n\nBasically XXI could be a mix of Salagirs take on high power and magic. A character that can do more than just match the other heavy hitters in strength if need be. Sort of like if an older non smug and actually competent Babadi was dropped into the body of Vegetto. No real ego involved or wanting to fight for fun even though he has more than enough power to do so, but a logical ancient eldritch being that wins in the fastest way possible to advance his plans. (AKA he wouldn’t just stand and watch as his foe powers up and transforms like most super villains in this series do, he’d stop it from happening if possible). Honor being so far beneath him, it doesn’t even cross his mind to not end whatever he’s facing as soon as possible.\n\nA combination of both power and magic extremes for a truly horrifying villain that can just magic you to death before the fight starts if possible, even if he could just outright destroy you with his power instead. Doesn’t play around like Zen Buu and isn’t looking for a challenge to test his strength and improve like Cell or even care to rule an empire with an iron fist like Freeza and his ilk. Just a timless monster that wins by the most logical way possible and stays focused on his original goals, with amazing magic and even power to back it up if need be. (Though one may wonder why he’d even need the dragon balls if he really does have accesses to other sets as we were shown when Buu walked in on him in the apartments).\n\nPost by drewsaga on\n\nAlready been touched on by a few others and been a theory for years but I do think the old man form/puppet of his really is just a ploy to make XXI seem weaker or even like a different character from what we he truly is.

Just a timless monster that wins by the most logical way possible, with amazing power and magic to back it up if need be. (Though one may wonder why he’d even need the dragon balls if he really does have accesses to other sets as we were shown when Buu walked in on him in the apartments).\n\nSounds like a scary and possibly unbeatable combination, but does XXI even have any real physical power (enough to compete against powerhouses without resorting to magic spells)? In DBZ, Elder Kai claims that the guy he fought that sealed him (via Z-Sword) was powerful but not as powerful as Majin Buu. Only feat we got was XXI destroying a tiny Buu head but I think even Goku and Vegeta could have disintegrated that with ease given how small it is and Buu was actively trying to mask his power (and presence in general). XXI might be the weakest remaining competitor if he is as weak as he was millions of years earlier when he sealed Elder Kai, being weaker than Vegeta of U18 but casts magic spells and \"fights\" that way.\n\nXXI might just be an antithetical to DBZ villains and how they operate and instead of winning through physical strength, fighting skill or even regeneration, XXI wins by casting magic spells and instead of getting arrogant and egotistical, XXI is pragmatic and tries exercising tons of caution (even against #18 he was being cautious). This might also signify that XXI, at least where he is at now, may not actually have power or he considers magic power to be power rather than chi being power.\n\nXXI might just also be a big part of an underlying theme that has started in DBM, that strength is not everything. This started with Vegetto facing XXI after having a glorious victory against Broly of U20, where XXI just teleported him and won without using strength. It's possible that XXI views power as unnecessary as his idea of power lies within magic, and he wants more Dragon Balls because that means more magic power! Gast and Zen Buu drive the point even more that strength is not everything by showing off their abilities as well in the magic realm. It's hard to believe that Goku or Vegeta wouls any chance of winning the finals against any of the four on the right bracket.\n\nThere is also the likely connection with Buu and XXI and XXI might have been responsible for even conceiving of ideas related to magic that inspired Bibidi to create Majin Buu. So maybe XXI can beat Buu through those means, but I don't think XXI even knows Bibidi since he was likely defeated millions of years ago in most universes.\n\nPost by Super-dee-Duper Veku on\n\nAlready been touched on by a few others and been a theory for years but I do think the old man form/puppet of his really is just a ploy to make XXI seem weaker or even like a different character from what we he truly is.

Only feat we got was XXI destroying a tiny Buu head but I think even Goku and Vegeta could have disintegrated that with ease given how small it is and Buu was actively trying to mask his power (and presence in general). XXI might be the weakest remaining competitor if he is as weak as he was millions of years earlier when he sealed Elder Kai, being weaker than Vegeta of U18 but casts magic spells and \"fights\" that way.\n\nXXI might just be an antithetical to DBZ villains and how they operate and instead of winning through physical strength, fighting skill or even regeneration, XXI wins by casting magic spells and instead of getting arrogant and egotistical, XXI is pragmatic and tries exercising tons of caution (even against #18 he was being cautious). This might also signify that XXI, at least where he is at now, may not actually have power or he considers magic power to be power rather than chi being power.\n\nXXI might just also be a big part of an underlying theme that has started in DBM, that strength is not everything. This started with Vegetto facing XXI after having a glorious victory against Broly of U20, where XXI just teleported him and won without using strength. It's possible that XXI views power as unnecessary as his idea of power lies within magic, and he wants more Dragon Balls because that means more magic power! Gast and Zen Buu drive the point even more that strength is not everything by showing off their abilities as well in the magic realm. It's hard to believe that Goku or Vegeta wouls any chance of winning the finals against any of the four on the right bracket.\n\nThere is also the likely connection with Buu and XXI and XXI might have been responsible for even conceiving of ideas related to magic that inspired Bibidi to create Majin Buu. So maybe XXI can beat Buu through those means, but I don't think XXI even knows Bibidi since he was likely defeated millions of years ago in most universes.\n\nGood points, wouldn’t be a bad idea for a different sort of DB villain such as you said, could be interesting as well. The one thing that makes me think he’s also really strong too is the comment that lil Buu made when he got blasted in his apartment. I don’t think he’s one to say something like that about just anyone, not seriously anyway but hard to say for sure.\n\nWe’ve gotten so little about XXI over the years with him being left on the back burner until Salagir either irons out what he wants to do with him or maybe he’s got a plan already. So he could be the real big bad or it’s possible and would be a hell of a troll move if he’s just a red herring (really hoping that’s not the case, a super eldritch monster would be pretty awesome).\n\nNow this is just making me think about how a Cthulhu like monster would work in the DB universe.\n\nPost by drewsaga on\n\nSounds like a scary and possibly unbeatable combination, but does XXI even have any real physical power (enough to compete against powerhouses without resorting to magic spells)?

Buu is already immune to the sealing spell, he was always afraid of it so he made a priority to find ways to counter it.\n\nHowever, it's also implied Old Kaioshin knows something about XXI, and Zen Buu has already absorbed him too. So it could go either way.\n\nI do remember that actually, I haven’t checked up on that novel in awhile. Seemed like it was put on hiatus but I did enjoy their take on Buus backstory from his point of view.\n\nCould see that being the case and a cool way of having Buu tied back to XXI, making him in a way a product of his magic. Would really drive home the point that even with how OP Buu is magically, XXI is the real OG magician. And if Salagir wants to keep the old Kais comment from DBZ about who sealed him in the sword being not as terrible as Buu true, it’s been millions of years sense that has happened so plenty of time for him to improve his magic and grow ridiculously stronger if need be. As I said in my previous comment I like the old Kai knowing of the real XXI or having a history with him. He just doesn’t recognize him yet because of the disguise, XXI hiding himself so the old Kai doesn’t run and tattle to the other Kais about what he really is.\n\nAs for their fight I do see Buu knowing how to counter the sealing spell by now so him countering that should start a real fight between the two unless XXI pulls out another ass pull spell that Buu can’t handle. Honestly with the way some of the fights have been playing out recently and especially with how the current Vegeta vs Cell fight is going. It might end up being another case of XXI not showing much new at all and us just getting another teaser of what he can do. These two being the supreme super wizards in this tournament, it would be such a waste to not take advantage of that and really cut loose having a ridiculously over the top but fun fight. With some real OP magic being thrown back and forth and having XXI be strong enough in his real form to actually fight with Buu if need be.\n\nWouldn’t be surprised if we only get a few pages between the two and learn nothing new about XXI, with him ending Buu quick (really hope that’s not the case, would be super disappointing). DBM could really use another good fight between the heavy hitters right now. Still feels like we’re stuck in the earlier rounds with all this playing around that’s going on and not the actual semifinals.\n\nPost by Super-dee-Duper Veku on\n\nImo the more I think about it, I wouldn’t mind it if it wasn’t the case that XXI couldn’t just magic away or destroy androids/cyborgs if he acted semi serious. Him really being some sort of maximum super hidden magical beast, being an amazing combination of every power angle that’s been presented in DB. Making cyborg Yamchas comment from Bardocks random vision just another red herring or misdirection at this point because of us not knowing the full context of what was going on in that vision if it still comes to pass.\n\nIf you think about it, his puppet self just using a potentially wish gained remote to easily shut #18 down for the reason of once again not revealing himself to anyone could make sense. Even if he could have just easily blasted her or actually still used some spell that might have done the job in a similar fashion. So basically it not being an excuse that he couldn’t just do it himself with a random “my magic won’t work on her or other cyborgs” but him trying to stay hidden for whatever reason like his previous bouts. (Magic is also pretty vague at times in this series so won’t say it’s a fair comparison but let’s all not forget how well #18 did on Kamis lookout after Super Buu ditched Gotenks and got the munchies, turned her ass to chocolate just as easily as anyone else shown).\n\nIt would also fall in line and be in character with how he has been shown to perform in all of his other tournament fights so far. It being brought up many times now already that XXI could just be looking to win as fast as possible against his opponents without revealing any more of his real capabilities. So to reiterate, a remote gained via a set of his own personal dragon balls would be able to grant him such an advantage and accomplish just that. Maybe he asked the same of how to beat Vegetto fast for all we know at this point? If what we were teased with when Zen Buu walked in on him is still true anyway and that was actually a dragon he was talking with. A wish granted remote not being that much more of stretch for him to win with then say using say a dimensional teleporting spell like he did against Vegetto originally.\n\nBoth tricks effectively yielded the same result and showed jack squat of what he can actually do being such fast wins. Lil Buus surprised statement after getting blasted by XXI’s “true” form still making it harder to determine if XXI isn’t also really powerful now as well. I’m also still curious though if what was brought up about Buu still having access to the Heloits super armor is true and it possibly helping him or coming into play in his fight with XXI some how.\n\nAll this said, still wonder why XXI would even care at all to win the tournament and get a wish if that was really another wish granting dragon in his apartments that he obviously has access to. Maybe the dragons that he has in his universe are some how weaker than the dragons we’ve seen for some reason and are just attempts on his part to recreate them with his own magic. Not being 100% successful turning out as pale imitations that are limited in their wish granting compared to a real Namekian dragon. With the Namekians being possibly extinct in his universe, this is a chance to get what he really wants or needs to wish for. This all just more guess work on my part so who knows."
