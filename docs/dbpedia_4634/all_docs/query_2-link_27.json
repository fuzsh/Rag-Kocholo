        "text": "The Freeza Saga (part one)!\n\nGokou has a reunion with his friends and introduces them to Gohan, his five year old son. However, a Saiyan alien lands on Earth and to seek Gokou. He introduces himself as Raditz, Gokou's older brother, and asks Gokou to join him in the Saiyan quest of universal destruction. But, when Gokou refuses, Raditz kidnaps Gohan to blackmails Gokou to kill innocent civilians. However, Gokou remains loyal to Earth and decides to rescue Gohan through another method-- by killing Raditz! Surprisingly, Piccolo allies with Gokou and the first fight of Dragonball Z began. Piccolo decides to gather energy to do a super fireball on Raditz. Meanwhile, Gokou stalls time. At the end, Gokou puts his brother in a hold. At the advantage, Piccolo unleashes his fireball, which blasts and hits both Gokou and Raditz! Klilyn finds the fighters and laughs at the dying Raditz as he mocks him that Gokou will be brought back to life through the power of the Dragonballs. Gokou's brother replies that the device he uses to detect energy levels can also be used for communication. He sends the news about the Dragonballs to his two comrades, and dies.\n\nBecause Piccolo discovered that Gohan had hidden powers when Gohan unknowingly headbutts and damages Raditz, he kidnaps Gohan in an attempt to train him. Gokou, rather than retiring in Heaven, is sent on a quest to run on Snake Way and to seek King Kaiou to receive training for the upcoming fight with the upcoming Saiyans. The rest of the Z warriors (Klilyn, Yamcha, Tenshin-han, and Chauzu) are gathered to receive special training from Kami\n\nOne year later, Nappa and Vegeta (the evil Saiyans) arrive to Earth. (But, they intend to find the Dragonballs to be granted the wish of immortality rather that to bring back the life of their unworthy comrade.) First come the battle against the Saiba-men (little Green monsters) that Nappa planted. The Saiba-men fight, but are eventually killed by Vegeta and Klilyn. (At one of these fights, Yamcha is killed.) After their defeat, our heroes fight Nappa; Vegeta stands in the background and watches. In a series of battles, Chauzu dies as he sacrifices himself in an attempt to blow up Nappa; Tenshin-han dies by using up his strength to try to kill Nappa; Piccolo dies when he covers Gohan from Nappa's fireball. Finally, Gokou arrives and easily defeats Nappa. Vegeta sees Nappa's uselessness and kills him with a single fireball.\n\nAs you all can guess, the remaining Z warriors begin to fight Vegeta. Gokou begins to fight Vegeta. The odds are against Vegeta, so Vegeta creates a energy ball that substitutes the moon. Then, he turns into his full moon stage and turns into a giant gorilla. Our heroes get kicked around, but Vegeta later gets his tail cut off by Yajirobe. Gokou donates energy from his Tenki-Dama to Klilyn. This fireball hits Vegeta, but Vegeta survives. Meanwhile, Gohan's tail grows back. Gohan turns into his full moon stage and kicks Vegeta around. Later, Gohan gets his tail cut off by Vegeta and finally turns back into a little boy... landing right on top of Vegeta. Vegeta, weary and defeated, crawls to his space shuttle and leaves Earth.\n\nThe Freeza Saga (final part)!\n\nFreeza, who destroyed the Saiya planet in the battle with Bardock (Gokou's father) is in search of the Dragonballs on Planet Namek (Piccolo's home planet) to become immortal. Bulma later discovers that there are Dragonballs on the Namek, but it would take thousands of years to travel there. PoPo appears and tells about the ship that Piccolo and Kami took to travel to Earth. With a faster spaceship, Klilyn, Gohan, and Bulma reach Namek to gather the dragonballs to revive Yamcha, Tenshin-han, Chauzu, and Piccolo... and encounter Freeza. (The Earth dragonballs vanished when Piccolo was killed.) Vegeta also goes to Namek to gather the dragonballs for immortality to kill Freeza.\n\nGokou later also travels to Namek after recovering from the battle against Vegeta. Meanwhile, Vegeta begins his fight against Freeza. Minions such as Dodorian, Freeza's right-hand man, are killed. Later, Freeza's other chief henchman, Zarbon, is also killed. Vegeta joins the Z Warriors, but only to insure that Gokou survives the battle so that he could kill him personally. (However, Vegeta ends up marrying Bulma, and Bulma is now pregnant with Trunks.) Freeza then calls on Team Ginew to fight the Z warriors, but Team Ginew was killed by Vegeta (except for Ginew, who accidently turned into a frog when he tried to swap bodies with Vegeta and Gokou threw a frog in his path). Then, follows the fights against Freeza, who goes through 3 transformations to reach perfect form. On one battle, Klilyn is killed and Gokou enrages in an anger that he reaches Super Saiyan level for the first time. (This is when the golden hair comes in.) He beats Freeza (as well as destroy Freeza's planet) with a single blast, and Freeza learns about the true powers behind a Super Saiyan. Afterwards, Gokou escapes to planet Yardrat, where he learns the ability to teleport. However, everyone thinks that Gokou was killed in battle. Freeza's father, Cold, learns about Freeza's defeat and quickly gathers Freeza's body parts, which are floating around in space. His henchmen re-ensemble Freeza. (This is why Freeza was half robotic.) Freeza tells his father about Gokou and his powers, but his father doesn't believe him and boasts that he is the universe's strongest warrior and . (These villians are space conquerers.)\n\nFreeza, Cold, and his crew land on earth to seek revenge on the Z Warriors and to destroy Earth. All of a sudden, a figure comes out of nowhere and adult Trunks appears. He turns into his Super Saiyan level and aids the Z Warriors in their fight. Trunks faces Freeza and his crew and easily kills them. (The dead Z Warriors were restored to life with a wish from the Dragonballs on planet Namek.) Trunks introduces himself as Bulma's and Vegeta's future son who grew up and traveled back in time with medicine to prevent the death of Gokou so that future would not be in chaos. Everyone thinks that Gokou is dead, but Trunks tells that Gokou is on Yardrat and will return soon. (This is the story of what happens in the next Dragonball Z series--the Cell series.) However, Vegeta is jealous over the fact that there is another Saiyan around -his own son- now, who is stronger than him.\n\nThe Cell Saga!\n\nAfter the battle against Freeza, our heroes enter the age of Cell...\n\nThis series starts off as Dr. Gero plots his revenge. He starts off by creating Android #19 to destroy Gokou. Dr. Gero later asks Android #19 to make him into a robot like him so that he would be stronger, and he becomes Android #20! The Z Warriors meet with Androids #19 and #20 and fight. Gokou leaves battle and Vegeta faces Android #19. Dr. Gero's plot fails and Android #19 is destroyed. Dr. Gero is also destroyed to pieces, but he programmed himself to auto-repair and survives.\n\nAndroid #20 then works on developing a better android model. Meanwhile, he unleashes two of his other creations, Android #17 and Android #18. Androids #17 and #18 get annoyed of Dr. Gero. As a result, Android #17 kills Dr. Gero. But, the doctor had just finished creating Android #21, who is still developing in a giant test tube. Before he dies, he issues the final command to his new android to feast on the rebellionous androids. Android #17 and Android #18 leave the lab and unleash Android #16. But as it turns out, Android #16 is a peaceful android. (This can be shown through his love towards the wild animals.) As time passes, the Z Warriors become aware of the new androids as they battle again and again but always reach a stalemate. However, the Z Warriors are still not match for the androids because the androids are robots, and therefore do not tire in a long battle while the Z Warriors eventually run out of energy. Gokou suffers a heart attack in one battle and retreats. Trunks, who was sent back in time by future Bulma with medicine to heal Gokou's heart so that Gokou would live to kill the androids and thus change the future, gives Gokou the medicine. Gokou is saved, but the Saiyans still do not continue to fight the androids. Instead, they train in a chamber to get stronger. Meanwhile, Piccolo fuses with Kami, his half father, to become stronger (His story is told in the Dragonball series.) Dende, a Namek child, replaces Kami as guardian of the dragonballs.\n\nAndroids #16, #17, and #18 go to seek Gokou to destroy him. Piccolo finds the androids first and begins to fight them. Back in Dr. Gero's lab, Cell has finished developing and breaks out of the giant \"test tube\", promising to fulfill his creator's wish.\n\nCell flies to find Androids #17 and #18. On his way devours the souls of the unlucky civilians he passes to become stronger. Finally, he meets with the other androids. To our heroes' surprise, they learn that Androids #17 and #18 know nothing about Cell. Cell and Android #17 threaten to kill each other. Android #17 heads out to fight him. But, he does not stand up to Cell and is easily defeated. This is when our heroes learn the great powers of Cell. Android #18 is now worried, but Android #16 flies out to fight Cell. To everybody's amazement, Android #16 is able to stand up to Cell. However, he is still destroyed. Cell now heads for his goal and devours Android #17 with his tail. Cell now changes into Cell--form 2. With the power of Android #17 combined to his, he becomes stronger than ever. Then, he heads over to devour Android #18. Android #18 tries to escape, but she is still eventually devoured. Cell now changes into Cell form 3, and becomes \"Perfect Cell\" Cell, after devouring the souls of so many people, is no longer an android and becomes organic.\n\nAfter Cell is gone, Bulma collects the body parts of Android #16 and repairs him. But, he is re-programmed to fight on the Z Warriors' side. Our heroes now head out to fight Cell. But, Android #16 is once again destroyed. Cell grows strong enough and reproduces. From his body came 7 Cell Juniors, young, blue duplicates of Cell. After a few more battles, Gohan, now a teenager, grows angry enough and reaches Super Saiyan level 2 and destroys all the Cell Juniors. In one of the battles that follows, Cell is kicked and Android #18 is spit back out. (She is unconscious.) Cell turns back into form 2 and is defeated. But, he activates his self destruction mode so that when he dies, the world will blow up with him. To save the Earth, Gokou teleports Cell out of Earth and into Kaiou's planet, where Cell blows up. Thus, Gokou, Kaiou, Kaiou's gorilla, and Kaiou's grasshopper die as well.\n\nThe Z Warriors mourn the loss of Gokou, but at the same time they cheer at the victory over Cell. Unexpectedly, a fireball flies out of nowhere and pierces through Trunks. Upon Trunks' death, Cell, in form 3, appears. He tells that when he blew up, a brain cell survived. From the cell, other cells multiplied and he was once again formed. Cell happily laughs as he tells that he is amazed he is able to rebuild himself into form 3! Then, Cell threatens to destroy the earth. Now it was up to Gohan to try to save our planet. With one arm (the other injured when he went to let a fireball meant for Vegeta hit him), Gohan prepares a fireball. He fires at Cell and Cell fires back. A stalemate is meant, but with Kaiou's help, Gokou is able to talk to Gohan and encourages him. Meanwhile, Klilyn protects the unconscious Android #18 and Yamcha, Tenshin-han, and Vegeta attack Cell in hope that this will Gohan distract Cell. With the help of the now dead Kaiou, Gokou, also dead, is able to communicate with Gohan and encourages him to use all his power to defeat Cell. Gohan overpowers Cell and Cell is disintegrated by Gohan's fireball. (But, Sataan takes credit for Cell's death because of his lies to the reporters.)\n\nAt the end, the warriors gather the dragonballs to bring those killed by Cell back to life. However, Gokou is still dead because he was already brought back to life once and cannot come back again, but tells that he is okay and is now with Kaiou. Android #18 awakens and flees. However, everybody learns here that Klilyn has develped a crush on Android #18! At the end of this series, there is a short memorial about the life of Gokou.\n\nThe Boo Saga!\n\nThe final series of Dragonball Z starts off with Gokou competing in a fighting tournament in one of the four Kaiou's planet. The result is that Gokou ties with his worthy opponent. Meanwhile, Gohan is training Goten in martial arts while Vegeta trains Trunks. Both Gohan and Vegeta are surprised at how strong Goten and Trunks are as they turn into their Super Saiyan form at such a young age. Gohan also has a girlfriend (Sataan's daughter). Later, Gohan, a hero who has achieved the identity as the Great Saiyan-Man, attends a tournament. When it is the Great Saiyan-Man's turn to compete, he turns into his Super Saiyan form and his disguise is blown off. Everyone is amazed that a nerd, Gohan, is the Great Saiyan-Man. All of a sudden, Spopobitch and Yamu come out of nowhere and absorb Gohan's energy into a \"lamp\" to revive Boo. Kaiou-shin and his partner, trying to prevent Babi-di's and Darbura's plot to reactivate Boo, allow this to happen so that he could follow the energy stealers to their hideout. (Babi-di's goal is to destroy all life just for the fun of it.) But, he revives Gohan first. The Saiyan warriors decide to go as well. A fight follows. Darbura turns Klilyn and Piccolo into stone and Kaiou-shin's partner is killed. The Z warriors learn that Klilyn and Piccolo will return to normal once Darbura dies. In battle, Vegeta is turned into Babi-di's slave (this is when the \"M\" appears on Vegeta's forehead). His energy is used to reactivate Boo. Boo betrays Drabura and eats him. Thus, Piccolo and Klilyn are returned to normal. Majin-Vegeta beats Gokou, and then goes to fight Boo. Upon failing, Vegeta self-destructs and dies. Afterwards, Bulma gathers the dragonballs to revive all those killed since the fighting tournament. In the fights later on, Gokou gets angry enough and reaches Super Saiyan form 3 for the first time! (In stage three, Gokou has long hair and is more powerful than ever.) Gohan also heads to Kaiou-shin's planet, pulls out the Z sword, and trains under Dai Kaiou-shin. Goten and Trunks train as well to get stronger. From Gokou, they learn the art of fusion to fuse to become one, becoming Gotenks!\n\nHowever, our heroes are still no match for Boo. Although Darbura's, the Prince of Darkness (Babi-di's associate who looks like a devil), and Babi-di's (a little ugly sorcerer with tiny hairs growing out of his body) other minions are killed, Boo gets stronger. Boo later revolts against his master (Babi-di) and kills him. Before their deaths, the villianous Babi-di and Darbura have casted a spell that turned Vegeta evil. However, in addition with fighting against Gokou, the evil Vegeta also fought Boo. Althought defeated by Boo, Vegeta later turns good again. It is here that Vegeta finally officially becomes one of the good guys. (In previous times, Vegeta only aids our heroes to assure that Gokou lives long enough for him to kill him. But, he never attempted to kill Gokou since the early battle against him in the Vegeta Series. Next, Boo separates into two forms-one good and the other evil. Evil Boo defeats good Boo, turns the him into a cookie, and eats him. From this method, the evil Boo gains the good Boo's powers and changes into a stronger form. Boo, previously fat, is now skinnier and taller, not to mention a lot stronger. Gotenks is also stronger; he is now able to turn into Super Saiyan stage 3, like Gokou. But, he is still defeated on one of his encounters with Boo and Boo engulfs SSJ3 Gotenks. Thus, Boo absorbed Gotenks' powers and becomes stronger again. He changes form again! (His \"antennae\" grows longer and he now wears a black vest like Gotenks'.) Piccolo is also defeated and eaten by Boo. Meanwhile, Gohan had mastered the Z sword and learned how to use his hidden powers without getting angry under training with Dai Kaiou-shin. (He does not turn into his Super Saiyan form for the rest of the series at this point.) Unfortunately, he too is defeated and engulfed. Boo, now with Gohan's powers, changes form again. (He now looks like he's wearing Gohan's clothes.) With the other warriors defeated, only Gokou and Vegeta are left to battle against Boo!\n\nGokou is still dead and watches the fight through Kaiou-shin's crystal ball. Seeing the unfortunate odds for our heroes, Dai Kaiou-shin sacrifices he life to Gokou and dies. Gokou's halo disappears, and Dai Kaiou-shin wakes back up with a halo over his head. Now, Gokou teleports into the battle. Vegeta, still dead, is also sent into battle by the judge of death. (Thus, Vegeta also comes back to life.) Gokou acquired a pair of special earrings from the Kaiou-shins that when each one is worn by different people, the two will permanently fuse. With Gokou wearing one of the earrings and Vegeta wearing the other, the two are pulled together and fused into Vegetto! At Vegetto's turn to fight Boo, Boo seems to be of no match to Vegetto, but Vegetto purposely gets eaten by Boo to save the other Z warriors. This cancelled the effects of the permanent fusion in Vegetto and Vegetto fisses back into Gokou and Vegeta.\n\nNext, Boo undergoes another form change and temporarily becomes very muscular as he stands still in pain through the form change. Gokou and Vegeta are now inside of Boo's organs. They find Trunks, Goten, Gohan, and Piccolo, and rescue them by carrying them out of one of Boo's pores. As they leave Boo, the warriors grow bigger and are restored to their normal size. Fat Boo, the good Boo, also escapes from Boo's body. The evil Boo, still \"puffy\" and bulky, is undergoing his form change to restore to his original form. (The Kaiou-shins cursed him into his previous fat looking form for destroying their people.) Afterwards, he is little and short. Next, evil Boo does a giant fireball and blows up Earth!!! Luckily, Gokou had enough time and teleported himself and his comrades to another planet. Later, the Namek dragonballs are gathered and a wish is made to restore the earth. The little Boo also met with the fat Boo. They fight, but the good Boo is once again defeated.\n\nI don't know how and why, but Gokou and Vegeta are later alone somewhere fighting Boo. Vegeta stalls Boo as Gokou gathers the energy to do a super Genki-Dama fireball. While Vegeta is getting kicked around by Boo, Piccolo, Gohan, Goten, and Trunks are on earth trying to convince the earthlings to raise their hands so that their energy will be given to aid Gokou strenthen his fireball. Because no one on earth listens to the heroes, a new approach is taken. Sataan is contacted for help. Because of his fame, he goes into public and raises his hands. All of his fans, everyone on Earth, raise their hands too to show their appreciation to Sataan. With everyone's hand raised, energy is transfered to Gokou and now has enough power to destroy Boo. With a single super fireball, Boo is destroyed.\n\nAt the end, the fat Boo, who was beaten unconscious, awakens and enters our heroes' side. Ten years past. Goten and Trunks are now teenagers. Gohan married Videl and now has a 5 year old daughter, Pan. Gokou wished to fight the evil Boo all over again, so he wished for the reincarnation of the evil Boo. The evil Boo, now Ubuu, is reincarnated (and not evil anymore) and under the training of Gokou.\n\nWoooaahhhh!!! This history is long! But it is the best Anime ever made!I just want to said -Thanx!- to Akira Toriyama because I think he is a genius!!! ~°_°~\n\nIf you want to see the info of the movies just click Here! -_-!\n\nMore Dragon Ball Inside Z Info :"
