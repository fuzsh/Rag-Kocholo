        "text": "It relies on unofficial translations, generous interpretations and results in a very significant outlier for the series at the time.\n\nThe \"supporting evidence\" is very weak as well. Using the title of a chapter which has no reason to be taken literally... Using Vegeta's statement which means nothing for AP.\n\nHow is this an outlier? This is literally narratively based this doesn’t break the narrative in any way\n\nIf the title of the chapter and statements fit the same narrative then why would it not be taken literally? Also I thought Hermes translations were universally accepted on this wiki\n\nEven if you severely lowball the time frame this is atleast 3-C or 3-B\n\n, . He instantly goes to the kai realm pretty much. So if he didn't, per gokus statement, he would have just destroyed the entire universe in a \"poof\", just gone.\n\nYeah the absolute best and most that can be given to buu is 3-A, Goku being explicitly not worried of Kid Buu prior to him IT on their location proves he never had the AP or range to destroy the macrocosm in one shot.\n\nDon’t personally agree with tier three though. 4-B and MFTL+ is all it takes to destroy everything in the universe.\n\nBased of context it can be interpertated as explosion in a sense\n\nThe context includes:\n\n\"This djinn possesses neither reason nor emotion. He exists solely to slaughter and destroy. To strike fear into the hearts of all living things. In just a few years, hundreds of planets were wiped out.\" ~ DBZ:251 - \"The Terrible Mystery\"\n\n\"Just as the Lord of Lords feared, Boo defies all imagination. At this rate, every living being on Earth and in the entire [universe] will be snuffed out.\" ~ DBZ:275 - \"A Slim Hope\"\n\nEarth is blown up. ~ DBZ:314 - \"The Boo of Pure Evil\"\n\n\"Give them your Potara! They can combine again! Here!! Before any more planets get destroyed!!\" ~ DBZ:315 - \"Battle for the Universe\"\n\nIt can easily be interpreted as one\n\n\"Poof\" can also be interpreted as \"all life forms and all planets disappearing\", which is consistent with the above statements.\n\n\"Poof\" can also be interpreted as \"all life forms and all planets disappearing\", which is consistent with the above statements.\n\nYeah, it wouldn't make sense narratively nor with the guides if it'd be over a long period of time, only for him to be 4-B, Null\n\nnot a counter to anything.\n\nYeah, it wouldn't make sense narratively nor with the guides if it'd be over a long period of time, only for him to be 4-B, Null\n\nnot a counter to anything.\n\nWhen you fall into a certain impression of what the \"narrative\" is, that starts to taint all other pieces of evidence.\n\nEveryone has different interpretations of what the \"Narrative\" is. It's not a good idea to rely upon it as an argument.\n\nEveryone has different interpretations of what the \"Narrative\" is. It's not a good idea to rely upon it as an argument.\n\nI agree, but if it's something that's well-established by multiple pieces of evidence and guidebooks, and the story itself contextualized by super is implying it, then I think it's clearly swaying our understanding of the story more to tier three than low tier 4.\n\nI agree with you \"narrative\" arguments suck, but I'm specifically talking baout the story and guides in this context\n\nThank you @Nullflowerblush. It has always been shown and implied that Buu's \"destruction of the Universe\" is an over-time issue. Vegeta's statement and the chapter title, if you wish to rely on such things, do not contradict that context.\n\nThis contradicts the guides and the story, as cell would be as much of a threat to the universe as Buu would, if this was true.\n\nInfinite stamina, and 4-B AP = Buu and Cell\n\nIf it's over time, than they are equal threats to the universe.\n\nNo it can't (poof is specifically used to make note of how instantenously something happens, and no it's not consistent. The story makes a clear distinction between Buu killing life and destroying individual parts of a place as minuscule as Earth in comparison than destroying the planet itself. The poof statement is completely unrelated to the above.\n\n<Destroys entire cities\n\n<80% and later all of humanity\n\n<10% of the planet itself\n\n<They still don't ever categorize it as him being in the process of destroying the Earth itself of Earth being destroyed\n\nLife, cities and an entire part of the planet to the Earth itself, is like, unfathomably close in scale to life and planets to the entire universe (literally a bigger discrepancy than grains of sand on a beach). This interpretation makes no sense, it's just not how the wording works nor how the story writes things. Buu destroying life and individual planets has nothing to do him with destroying the universe itself.\n\nI Disagree. Unofficial translations are 99% unacceptable imo. You can change one word and create an entirely different kind of feat. The raw japanese would need to back up an unofficial translation if it was to be taken over the official ones.\n\nAn example of this would be the common use of the japanese word \"Hoshi\" 星 to refer to either a planet or star. The english translation of this word can easily turn a planet busting statement into a star busting statement, which is a massive difference to justify on a whim.\n\nThere needs to be intense scrutiny with unofficial translations. I'm not totally against them, but it is still 'technically' non-canon. They should only be used in specific situations where we do not have an official english translation, or it is very clear what the statement in japanese is referring to.\n\nI Disagree.

Not to mention the wording used being the same as Zeno destroying 6 universes, which the official Crunchyroll subs translated as \"Boom\" if I'm not mistaken.\n\nThe translation's fine."
