        "text": "By Jeremy Carden\n\nI love how characters can be introduced into a series for a handful of episodes, but easily become fan favorites because of the impact that they had on the series. Some characters have great back stories, are extremely powerful or have a mysterious factor to them that makes fans want more.\n\nPikkon is one of these characters, and this Piccolo-like character has had fans wanting him to appear in the series more for quite some time now.\n\nHe only appears in a handful of filler episodes on the Grand Kai’s Planet, but he is one of the most powerful characters in the series (at least during the time that he was introduced). During Goku’s stay in the Other World, we find out that anyone that has died a heroic death is allowed to keep their body in order to train in death.\n\nThere are so many unanswered questions about Pikkon, and I am sure that you have read memes on the internet about him.\n\nAbove is one of my favorite memes, and it does create more curiosity about Pikkon’s demise. We do not know how long he has been dead, but I think that it is safe to say that he was not as powerful as he was shown to be in the series during the time of his death.\n\nSeriously, he took out King Cold and Frieza as easily as Beerus took out Super Saiyan 3 Goku!\n\nMost fans are quick to assume that Pikkon is Super Saiyan 2-tier after he “defeated” Cell with one attack! I must admit that I thought the same back when I first got into DB, but you have to take into consideration that Pikkon caught Cell completely off-guard.\n\nHis Burning Shoot attack is similar to the Kaio-Ken which is a power boosting technique for a temporary increase in strength and speed.\n\nSimilar to how Master Shen’s Dodon Ray could be seen as the counterpart of Master Roshi’s Kamehameha. You could speculate that the Burning Shoot was West Kai’s own technique to rival North Kai’s Kaio-Ken.\n\nThat would make sense considering that the two were always competing with each other, and their techniques would rival each other.\n\nWhile the Kaio-Ken gives the user a blazing aura, the Burning Shoot literally gives the user a “blazing aura” of flames! It is unknown if the technique allows Pikkon to increase it multiple levels like the Kaio-Ken, but it was shown to be extremely powerful during the one time that we actually saw it used.\n\nI think it is safe to assume that during life, Pikkon did not have techniques in his arsenal such as the Burning Shoot or the Thunder Flash Attack. Those moves probably came from his training with the West Kai.\n\nMoving back to the subject of his power, I think that he might be Super Saiyan 2-tier at his maximum; when removing his weights to increase his power.\n\nThe proof of this comes from the brief moment that Goku uses the Super Kaio-Ken. Even though he was dead, Goku’s body could not handle the increase in strength that the technique provided.\n\nSuper Kaio-Ken basically doubled Full Power Super Saiyan Goku’s power level, and that is basically equal to what his power would have been as a Super Saiyan 2.\n\nRemember that Super Saiyan 2 is twice the power of Super Saiyan 1/Full Power Super Saiyan, but the Kaio-Ken arguably puts a greater strain on the body than a regular Super Saiyan transformation. King Kai says that using the techniques in a damaged/weakened state, or going too high in the Kaio-Ken levels could destroy the user’s body.\n\nGoku was weakened during his fight with Pikkon, but his opponent barely had a scratch on him. “Super Saiyan 2 Goku” (Super Kaio-Ken) was able to land a single punch that sent Pikkon into one of the orbiting planets or moons above the arena, but he was able to recover quickly for a counterattack.\n\nGiven the fact that Pikkon took a “Super Saiyan 2” level punch to the face without any damage hints at his power potentially giving the likes of even Super Saiyan 2 Gohan from the Cell Games a run for his money!\n\nKeep in mind that this is Pikkon WITHOUT using the Burning Shoot to further increase his power!\n\nFull Power Super Saiyan Gohan’s power was greater than Goku’s was during his time at the Cell Games. However, it wasn’t a massive gap in power between father-and-son. With that being said, if Goku went Super Saiyan 2 during the Cell Games, Gohan would be stronger…but not by THAT much power.\n\nIn any case, we can assume that Pikkon’s death was probably due to a fight that ended to him losing his life due to defeat or sacrificing himself for someone else (like Goku did against Raditz and Cell).\n\nThis could explain his serious personality and desire to get stronger. Perhaps his motivation for training was to prevent him from losing to anyone else again, or to protect people from threats even in death. This just goes to show how noble of a character he is.\n\nConsidering that Grand Kai sends him to Hell to calm down new inmates, we know that he is a character not to be taken lightly in strength and he was potentially the #1 fighter in Other World until Goku died fighting Cell.\n\nWe know that his Piccolo-like personality was “erased” during Fusion Reborn. Writers from the show say that this was done in order to separate his character from Piccolo because if you re-watch the Other World Tournament Saga, it is almost impossible to not see Pikkon as just another Piccolo.\n\nOverall, he is a great character that I would not mind seeing during Dragon Ball Super or other DB related media. Canon or non-cannon, I think that he is one of my favorite characters from the show!\n\nHow do you think Pikkon died? How strong do you think he was before dying, and how strong do you think he was when he met Goku? Could he defeat Super Saiyan 2 Gohan in his prime?\n\nLike what you read?

On that page, I discuss many other Dragon Ball related topics and theories about the franchise! Be sure to pass it along to your friends, and I look forward to your thoughts in the comment section below.\n\nBy Jeremy Carden\n\nAfter watching Revival of F, I have a very strong hunch that Dragon Ball fans will once again see a Goku/Vegeta fusion!\n\nIf you ask me, I think that Whis’ main goal in training the Saiyan duo is not only to help them perfect their fighting abilities as individuals, but to also make them understand that they need to learn how to work together.\n\nWhis pointed out that Vegeta is too tense and Goku is too carefree. The two are practically opposing opposites when it comes to fighting. Vegeta is the more brilliant fighter, but Goku is better when it comes to off the wall combat (a good fighter that does not go by the books, he is better at overcoming obstacles by thinking outside of the box).\n\nI mean if you look at the times when the two actually worked together to defeat the odds, you have to admit that they make a very potent combo!\n\nFor a moment, forget about what is canon and what is non-canon. Think back to some epic moments within the Dragon Ball franchise when these Saiyans actually teamed up.\n\nThe Return of Cooler was a movie where neither Saiyan could take Cooler on in his new form.\n\nWhen they put aside their differences, the team destroyed 1 Meta-Cooler robot (before 1,000 showed up). In the end, they overpowered the Big Gete Star achieving victory!\n\nIn the anime-only battle with Buuhan, each Saiyan was getting wrecked by the “mightiest Majin.”\n\nGoku convinced Vegeta to use the Potara Earrings in order to save the universe, and Vegito was beating around Buu with ease!\n\nHow about when Super Janemba was able to defeat Super Saiyan 3 Goku and Super Saiyan 2 Vegeta?\n\nThey ended up creating Gogeta in order to send that demon back into oblivion!\n\nFinally, the threat of Omega Shenron proved too great for even a couple of Super Saiyan 4s to stop!\n\nOnce again, fusion created Gogeta to stop another threat to the universe (though this time around; Gogeta did not get the job done…).\n\nMy point is that Goku and Vegeta are extremely powerful as individuals, but working together has proven that the two can overcome almost any obstacle in their way.\n\nI think Goku said it best when he was describing the Fusion Dance back during the Buu Saga. He said that a being created from the fusion would be capable of accomplishing feats that neither individual could do alone.\n\nDon’t you think that Vegito and Gogeta fit that description perfectly? I mean whenever the Saiyans fused, it was because they realized that they did not stand a chance of winning against their opponent at the time as individuals. They had no other option but to fuse in order to defeat the odds with overwhelming power!\n\nNow the question remains as to whether or not Goku and Vegeta will actually fuse in the Dragon Ball Super series.\n\nOriginally, I thought that if there was a movie to follow Revival of F; the two would fuse again. You have to admit that the movie itself seemed like a setup in order for the Saiyans to realize that they need to work together in order to achieve the best results.\n\nI mean they fought against each other instead of fighting together against Frieza, and the entire world was destroyed (until Whis reversed time) due to their unwillingness to work as a team!\n\nAt the end of the film, Goku mentioned that their battle with Frieza was proof that Whis was correct when he said that they should work together more. However, Vegeta scoffed at the remark about them working together. With laughter, Goku agreed that it would never happen.\n\nIs that right?\n\nConsidering that Champa, Universe 6 and the Super Dragon Balls will appear in the DB Super anime/manga; I think the two WILL fuse again!\n\nWhy?\n\nWith 11 other universes out there that contain beings more powerful than Beerus AND Whis, the Saiyans will eventually come across opponent(s) too powerful for them to defeat alone.\n\nFusion would be their only option, and it will be their trump card in order to win against their foes.\n\nAs I mentioned in another blog about Gogeta appearing within the DB Super series, I think that the two fusing would be their completion of their training under Whis.\n\nI feel this way because as I mentioned above, Whis is teaching the two how to overcome their individual weaknesses, and to also work together as a team.\n\nConsidering that Lord Beerus could be defeated if the two worked together (Whis mentioned this), I think Goku and Vegeta teaming up would be a threat to even gods more powerful than Beerus from some of the other universes!\n\nWhis seeing the two truly working together would be the icing on the cake (because we know how Whis and Beerus love to eat) to their training.\n\nFans are split as to which fusion would actually appear within the DB Super series. Some say that Gogeta will finally make an appearance, and others are strongly behind Vegito reappearing.\n\nThe thing that gets me is when fans say that Gogeta CAN’T appear because he is NOT considered canon. Personally, that makes absolutely no sense whatsoever. True, his appearance in GT and Fusion Reborn were considered my most to be non-canon. However, the Fusion Dance itself IS canon because the technique appearance in the anime and manga.\n\nGoku knows about the dance, and he would show it to Vegeta if necessary for them to actually fuse against an opponent. Of course, I am sure that he would object to it because of the prissy movements needed to execute the technique. He did perform an embarrassing bingo dance to save the planet from destruction. What harm could performing one little ballet dance (Fusion Dance) do?\n\nThink about how upset he was when he had to hold hands with Goku in order to teleport to earth using Instant Transmission! Although, I thought he could have just placed his hand on Goku’s shoulder or something, but I guess the writers wanted to make that scene as awkward as they possibly could.\n\nIn my opinion, I believe that Gogeta will be the one who appears in the DB Super series if the Saiyans ever fused.\n\nWhy?\n\nDo you really believe that Vegeta or Goku would want to do a permanent fusion (again)?\n\nThe only reason Vegito split was because of Buu’s digestive system breaking the Potara Fusion apart.\n\nIn Battle of Gods, Revival of F and DB Super Episode 5, whenever fusion was mentioned it was a reference to Vegito NOT Gogeta. This is because Vegito was the only fusion between the two to appear in both the anime and manga.\n\nUnless we see Vegito from one of the other 11 universes, I do not think that he will appear again. Perhaps there is another universe where they used the Potara Fusion, but for whatever reason they did not split apart.\n\nThis is what happened in the DB Multiverse series because there was a universe where Vegito did not remove the barrier protecting him within Buu’s body. After escaping with the absorbed Z-Fighters, Vegito killed Kid Buu (and the fusion stayed intact).\n\nI know that DB Super is changing some of the events of Battle of Gods/Revival of F, but it is still unknown whether or not the ending of DBZ anime/manga will be kept the same. I am not just referring to Uub appearing and then leaving to train with Goku.\n\nI am talking about Goku and Vegeta not being fused into Vegito because we see them as two individual Saiyans.\n\nThat is why I feel that if they do fuse, Goku and Vegeta would use the Fusion Dance to become Gogeta.\n\nWho is to say that the Kais couldn’t make special Potara Earrings that would allow a temporary fusion?\n\nHowever, that would be like opening a can of worms in order to make Vegito show up again.\n\nAnother possibly is that Whis (or another being) knows of a fusion technique that we have never seen before! There really is no clear understanding on where the story of DB Super is going because it has just started. I am really excited because of the revival of the DB franchise as a whole, and anything can happen!\n\nI could care less about which fusion appears because I love both Gogeta and Vegito. The one thing that I want to see more than anything is an opponent that makes a Goku/Vegeta fusion actually HAVE to use their full power!\n\nRemember that Super Gogeta, Super Vegito and Super Saiyan 4 Gogeta dominated their opponents with ease. We never got to see the full extent of their power, and that is something that a lot of fans would want to see at some point.\n\nCan you imagine the power and techniques utilized by a full power Gogeta or Vegito? It makes me excited because any awesome techniques from the series are almost always put into DBZ video games. Not to mention the possibility of a new Super Saiyan level!\n\nWhich fusion do you think will appear in the future; Gogeta, Vegito or someone entirely new?\n\nLike what you read?

On that page, I discuss many other Dragon Ball related topics and theories about the franchise! Be sure to pass it along to your friends, and I look forward to your thoughts in the comment section below.\n\nBy Jeremy Carden\n\nI love to write about the topics that Dragon Ball fans either debate about the most or rarely think about. In this case, I believe the topic of this blog is something that fans have been debating about since the Buu Saga was first released.\n\nThe subject of this blog is about whether or not Gohan has the ability to transform into a Super Saiyan while in his Ultimate form.\n\nLet me start off with what some Dragon Ball sources have to say about Ultimate Gohan becoming a Super Saiyan 1 and Super Saiyan 2. Daizenshuu 2 seems to be the primary source regarding the Super Saiyan transformations that Gohan is still capable of even after Old Kai’s ritual:\n\n“Daizenshuu 2 states that Gohan’s dormant power is bottomless. It also states that Ultimate Gohan is still capable of becoming a Super Saiyan, but even without utilizing the form he surpasses Super Saiyan 3 Gotenks in power, if Ultimate Gohan was to become a Super Saiyan his power would likely rise to levels above even Super Buu (Gohan, Piccolo, Goten, and Trunks absorbed).”\n\nNow I will give my thoughts on the above statement from the Daizenshuu, I agree that Gohan’s dormant power is essentially bottomless. This has been shown time and time again throughout the series.The second part of the statement is something that I also agree with because Gohan was easily able to beat up Super Buu.\n\nSuper Saiyan 3 Gotenks on the other hand was more or less on par with the Majin, but he was not able to completely dominate him like Gohan did.\n\nAs for the final part, I will say that I agree with a Super Saiyan Ultimate Gohan being able to surpass Buuhan. However, that depends on whether or not the Super Saiyan transformation would still raise Ultimate Gohan’s power 50 times over according to the Super Saiyan multiplier chart.\n\nI mean we know that Ultimate Gohan was the strongest un-fused character in the series at that point during the Buu Saga. Could you image his power being increased by 50 with a Super Saiyan transformation, and potentially 100 times over with a Super Saiyan 2 transformation?!\n\nI dare say that his power might even surpass that of Vegito if he had used any Super Saiyan transformation as Ultimate Gohan! However, that again is only based on whether or not the Super Saiyan multipliers would come into play with Ultimate Gohan going Super Saiyan 1 or 2. Honestly, I cannot really see why they would not be applied aside from plot purposes where Gohan was meant to lose to an opponent.\n\nHere is another piece from Daizenshuu 2 regarding Gohan’s power:\n\n“Ultimate Gohan can still transform further into a Super Saiyan, however, even without transforming his power still surpasses Gotenks. Ultimate Gohan is rarely shown transforming into a Super Saiyan form throughout his appearances, though he does when found as a necessity as seen in Dragon Ball Z: Battle of Gods when he helped contribute to making Goku become a Super Saiyan God. Later, not keeping up with his training during Dragon Ball Z: Resurrection ‘F’, he became a Super Saiyan when fighting Shisami and effortlessly beats him. Gohan going Super Saiyan in his Ultimate form was powerful enough as to where it concerned and made the newly empowered Frieza to attack and kill Gohan so his men could have a chance as Frieza himself says Gohan alone is more than capable of beating all 1000 men by himself. Gohan was brought back to life by Piccolo moments later.”\n\nAs you can see, the statement above is in reference to Gohan’s power from Battle of Gods and Revival of F.\n\nIn the trailer for Battle of Gods, we saw Gohan powering up into a Super Saiyan (we assume Super Saiyan instead of Super Saiyan 2 due to lack of an electric aura, but the same can be said about Vegeta when he powered up without an electric aura in a rage over Bulma being smacked).\n\nDuring the actual movie, Gohan is powering up into his Ultimate form to battle Beerus.\n\nWhile the Saiyans tried twice in order to get Goku to the Super Saiyan God level, Gohan was a Super Saiyan in both attempts.\n\nAt the start of the film during the party, it appears as if Gohan was in his base form due to his appearance.\n\nWhen the gloves came off to fight Beerus, he powered up into his Ultimate form, and later into a Super Saiyan to give his dad power.\n\nIt does not look like Gohan powered down from his Ultimate form before going Super Saiyan during the Super Saiyan God ritual. This is made apparent by his forelock hanging down, and comparing the lack of said forelock in his regular clothing.\n\nYou are probably asking yourself about Ultimate Gohan’s power as a Super Saiyan, and why he did not power up to that level to combat Beerus.\n\nThe same can be said about Gotenks fusing as a Super Saiyan instead of a Super Saiyan 3 to combat Beerus, but I will get to that point later in the blog about how the writer’s plot trumps a character’s power.\n\nMoving to Revival of F (which takes place about 1 year after Battle of Gods), Gohan’s lack of training has caused his Ultimate form to lose power. True, Old Kai brought his hidden potential to the surface. However, due to no training to maintain that power; Gohan’s 100% power so to speak was much weaker at this point.\n\nDon’t believe this could happen to someone who has their peak power brought to the surface?\n\nRemember that during the Cell Games, Gohan’s hidden power was brought out in the form of Super Saiyan 2. Due to 7 years of no training, Gohan’s power diminished and this was pointed out by Goku and Vegeta.\n\nHow Ultimate Gohan’s power would decrease substantially due to merely 1 year of no training is beyond me, but that goes back to the power of the plot trumping the power of fan theories. Not to mention that Gohan said that he “thinks” that he could still go Super Saiyan implying that his power and lack of training was so serious that he might not even be able to power up like he used to.\n\nApparently in Revival of F, Gohan was fighting against Frieza’s army as Ultimate Gohan. I was shocked when I read about this, and this might have been due to Gohan’s new hairstyle that threw me off.\n\nSeriously, I thought that was merely base Gohan easily fighting off Frieza’s soldiers. It is also important to point out that the Z-Fighters (Jaco included) were holding back. Even Frieza noticed that his army was so weak the “earthlings” were not even killing them, but only beating them up with ease despite being heavily outnumbered.\n\nFrieza was taken aback when Ultimate Gohan went Super Saiyan and took out Shisami in one blow. The power of Shisami has not been revealed, but some sources rank him around the power of Zarbon and Dodorai. This would put him around 22,000 or 23,000.\n\nHowever, that would make no sense considering he was fighting on par with Piccolo (Super Namek). Piccolo’s power had LONG surpassed 23,000, and he had accomplished that feat after his training on King Kai’s planet before he arrived on Namek and fused with Nail going into the 1,000,000 power level range.\n\nHe had fought on par with Android 17, and further increased his power after a solo training session in the Time Chamber in preparation for the Cell Games.\n\nI wrote a blog on my thoughts regarding Piccolo’s power during the Dragon Ball series, and you can read that here.\n\nDuring that point in the series (Revival of F), I would rank Piccolo at least around the power of a Full Power Super Saiyan Goku or Gohan from the Cell Games.\n\nThe fact that Piccolo was a bit worn out from fighting so many soldiers in my mind would not make him weak enough for a Zarbon-level opponent to be giving him a hard time!\n\nNot to mention that Ultimate Gohan would have to go Super Saiyan in order to knock him out!\n\nThis just goes to show that the plot of Revival of F was meant to heavily lower the power of any character that was not Goku or Vegeta! It was almost as if I was watching GT again…\n\nHowever, not to get off subject with a rant, I think that Frieza was right to worry about Gohan’s power. Not only had he experienced that power firsthand when Gohan was a child, but he was right in assuming Gohan alone could have killed his army. A feat that I think Piccolo could have done as well if his power was not crippled by the writers…\n\nYou see if Gohan was in his base form (not Ultimate Gohan) fighting Frieza’s army, and had to take out Shisami by going Super Saiyan because by some way of writing his power was on par with Piccolo then it would have made sense.\n\nWhy?\n\nPiccolo is far more powerful than base Gohan, Goku and Vegeta because of his Super Namek fusion. Going Super Saiyan would have been the only way they could have beaten up Piccolo; I’m talking pre-Battle of Gods here folks.\n\nNow for Ultimate Gohan to have to go Super Saiyan to beat this guy seems flat out ridiculous. I might have to write a separate blog about Shisami’s power because of how much nonsense that subject seems to gather.\n\nFirst form Frieza “killed” Gohan with a punch to the gut right after he had taken a Senzu bean showing that his new power was nothing to play with.\n\nI think that it might be safe to assume that even if Ultimate Gohan went Super Saiyan 1 or 2, he might not have been able to tangle with Final Form Frieza as his father did as a Saiyan beyond God.\n\nAside from the Daizenshuu, there is another source regarding Super Saiyan Ultimate Gohan:\n\n“In Dragon Ball Z: Dokkan Battle, Ultimate Gohan (Resurrection ‘F’) is also able to further power up into a Super Saiyan 2 form.”\n\nDespite being a video game, it is probably safe to assume that Super Saiyan 2 Ultimate Gohan is actually a reality.\n\nAt this point it seems clear that Ultimate Gohan CAN transform into a Super Saiyan 1 and 2.\n\nHowever, it is still made unclear why he never utilized this power before in order to defeat his opponents. I know most of you are wondering why he did not use this power in order to defeat Buutenks.\n\nI mean it was mentioned above that a Super Saiyan Ultimate Gohan might have had the power to surpass Buuhan, and that would mean he could have killed Buutenks easily.\n\nWhile Majin Buu was in the middle of transforming after absorbing Gotenks and Piccolo, Gohan just stood there looking…not doing anything at all.\n\nGoku who was watching from Supreme Kai’s planet through the crystal ball was yelling for Gohan to raise his power because Buu was once again changing.\n\nDid this mean that Goku knew that Gohan could raise his power higher even in his Ultimate form, or was that simply just dialogue pointing out the obvious for Gohan to not just stand there, but to prep for Buu’s more powerful form that was about to emerge?\n\nI think it is pretty clear that if Ultimate Gohan even went to Super Saiyan 1, he could have killed Buutenks and that would have been the end of the Majin threat.\n\nAkira Toriyama stated that his original plan was for Ultimate Gohan to be the one to kill Buu, and become the hero of the universe once again as he had during the Cell Games. However, due to Gohan’s personality, Toriyama did not really see him as the one to be mankind’s sworn protector.\n\nThat role seemed to fit Goku’s personality more, and though I hate to admit it…he has a good point about that.\n\nDespite the “logic” of Ultimate Gohan clearly being the one to defeat Buu, Gohan would have most likely gone back to school and lived a normal life. Goku on the other hand would simply train to get more powerful for his own satisfaction, but also to save his earth from future threats.\n\nIn a series based on a hero who would save mankind from present and future threats, it would make more sense for Goku to be the one to kill Buu. However, in terms of power and who could have gotten the job done the easiest, that would have been Gohan hands down (or Vegito for that matter).\n\nWith that being said, it appears that if Akira allowed Gohan to go Super Saiyan in his Ultimate form, it would not have been the best move for the overall plot. This could be why Ultimate Gohan was simply fighting in his “base form” against Majin Buu.\n\nThis could all go back to Old Kai’s ritual and what it actually did to Gohan’s power. If you ask me, it was very similar to Guru’s method of releasing a being’s hidden potential. Of course, his ritual was much faster than Old Kai’s.\n\nGuru would simply place his hand on the person’s head, and their power would instantly be released.\n\nOld Kai’s ritual seems to last longer if a person has tremendous hidden potential, but does not last as long for someone with little to no massive power buried deep within them.\n\nI think that both hidden power rituals did the SAME thing to Gohan’s power; bringing his hidden potential to the surface. However, this did not mean that Gohan’s power could not be increased through training and Zenkai boosts.\n\nGohan’s power seems to be essentially bottomless, and with Zenkai boosts due to his Saiyan blood, Gohan’s strength can and will increase regardless of his hidden power being brought to the surface.\n\nHis power was around 1,500 when he first arrived on Namek, and was over 10,000 after Guru released his hidden potential.\n\nDuring his battles with the Ginyu Force and Frieza, Gohan’s power increased dramatically! With Zenkai boosts from being healed with a Senzu Bean and Dende’s healing power along with his fits of rage; Gohan’s strength skyrocketed into the millions. This was proven when he had 2nd and 3rd form Frieza on the ropes!\n\nWith that being said, Guru brought Gohan’s hidden potential to the surface that he possessed at that point in time. This created Gohan’s new “base form” so to speak.\n\nOld Kai practically did the same thing with Ultimate Gohan being Gohan’s “base form.” Gohan could further raise his “new base form” with his Super Saiyan transformations if he needed to…like he could and should have done against the likes of Buu, Beerus and the newly revived Frieza.\n\nRemember what Old Kai said to Goku prior to him going to earth to use the Potara Earrings with Gohan (but instead used them with Vegeta)?\n\nHe told Goku NOT to fuse as a Super Saiyan because that form is not natural and causes a strain on the body. This would shorten the fused being’s life if he were created through a Super Saiyan fusion. Old Kai further states that due to the Potara Fusion being so powerful, going Super Saiyan could be done AFTER fusing but it would most likely NOT be necessary.\n\nCompare this to what he told Gohan about unleashing his new power; Old Kai said to “do that Super Saiyan thing that you always do.” Old Kai always seemed to use double-talk or give a double meaning behind his dialogue. He most likely was saying that Ultimate Gohan’s power would be sufficient against any opponent and going Super Saiyan is something that could be done but would most likely not be necessary.\n\nThis makes a lot of sense now that I think about it, and it could indeed prove that Ultimate Gohan was practically base Gohan with a new power and attitude! His Super Saiyan transformations were practically a bonus but not a necessity due to Old Kai being confident about his ritual and other power up methods that the ways of a temporary power up like a Super Saiyan would not be needed at all.\n\nNot to mention Ultimate Gohan does not have to suffer from physical strain or substantial Ki drain as he would have through Super Saiyan transformations (unless you exclude Full Power Super Saiyan, but even then the form is not something that would last forever like a base form would because it is not natural).\n\nFor the most part he was right because Ultimate Gohan beat down Super Buu (prior to becoming Buutenks). Furthermore, Vegito was able to take down Buuhan will little effort in his base form (anime only).\n\nIf you ask me, the question about Ultimate Gohan going Super Saiyan is very similar to Goku and Vegeta going Super Saiyan God Super Saiyan 1, 2 and 3.\n\nSaiyan beyond God is a “base form” taken on by a Saiyan that had absorbed the power of a Super Saiyan God. This essentially means that Saiyan beyond God Goku is just as powerful as Super Saiyan God Goku, but without the time limit that the Super Saiyan God form suffers from.\n\nThis mirrors Ulimate Gohan being on par it not more powerful than a Super Saiyan 3, but without the Ki drawbacks that the form possesses.\n\nA Saiyan beyond God and Ultimate Gohan can essentially raise their power through Super Saiyan transformations, but the question remains if a Super Saiyan Ultimate Gohan is 50 times more powerful than Ultimate Gohan or a Super Saiyan God Super Saiyan is 50 times more powerful than a Saiyan beyond God due to that “base form” practically being the same power as a Super Saiyan God.\n\nUntil we get the official power rating from Akira himself, I doubt that this subject will ever have a decisive answer. However, it is always fun to speculate about it. Although it gives me a massive headache just thinking about it, but this blog had to be written.\n\nOverall, this was a topic that I had never thought about until I read some new sources regarding Revival of F. In GT, I was thinking that Ultimate Gohan was no more due to lack of training or the writers not including him in the series. Gohan instead would go Super Saiyan 2 in all of his battles.\n\nDespite Ultimate Gohan being able to increase his power through Super Saiyan transformations, Akira practically ignored this in Goku’s favor so that he could be the hero. Again, it goes back to Super Saiyan 1 or 2 Ultimate Gohan being able to take down almost any foe, and that would have made it difficult to write an opponent powerful enough to take him down.\n\nWhat do you think about this theory? Could Ultimate Gohan truly go Super Saiyan 1 and 2? If so, how powerful would he have really been?\n\nLike what you read?

Be sure to pass it along to your friends, and I look forward to your thoughts in the comment section below.\n\nBy Jeremy Carden\n\nWith all of the leaked information about the new series, fans are very confused about when the series will take place. Originally, it was believed that Dragon Ball Super would take place after the events of Revival of Frieza.\n\nHowever, with recent pictures and chapters from the DB Super manga, it appears that this is not the case. Fans are even speculating that DB Super will erase Battle of Gods and Revival of Frieza off of the map due to an inconsistency involving Beerus and his premonition of a Super Saiyan God!\n\nAgain, this is all speculation, and this blog is going to cover my own personal thoughts as to when this series will take place. Not only that, I will mention my own opinions on where the series will go. We do know that it is going to be at least 100 episodes, and possibly more depending on how well it is received by fans.\n\nOverall, I feel that this series will recap the events that occurred between the defeat of Kid Buu and the movie Battle of Gods. From there, it will cover the events between Battle of Gods and Revival of Frieza.\n\nAfterwards, it will cover the events between Revival of Frieza and Goku leaving the 28th World Tournament with Uub.\n\nWhat I would love to see is the series going even beyond that like GT did!\n\nSomething that could really throw things into perspective is the special released in Japan called “Yo! Son Goku and his friends return!” This is the anime special that introduced us to Vegeta’s brother named Tarble.\n\nHere is what the time frame between Kid Buu’s death and Uub leaving with Goku looks like based on the original dates given in the Japanese version:\n\nThe short film about Tarble took place 2 years after the defeat of Kid Buu\n\nBattle of Gods took place 2 years after “Yo! Son Goku”\n\nRevival of Frieza occurred 1 year after Battle of Gods\n\nThis means that there are still 5 years for the writers to play around with before the anime episode called “Granddaughter Pan.” In this episode, we see the series fast forward 10 years from the death of Kid Buu.\n\nIn the end, the biggest question raised by fans is whether or not the ending of DB Super will stay true to the original ending of DBZ. Goku leaving with Uub occurs 10 years after the defeat of Kid Buu.\n\nLet’s say that DB Super, Revival of F and Battle of Gods fit into the continuity of events that leads up to Goku vs. Uub. Re-watching that fight, it is amazing to believe that young Uub is holding his own with Goku (who by that time had achieved Super Saiyan God, Saiyan beyond God, Super Saiyan God Super Saiyan and possibly even more power!)!\n\nHowever, keep in mind that Goku was clearly holding back in that fight in order to test Uub’s abilities.\n\nNot to mention that similar to Tien’s Neo-Tri Beam against Semi-Perfect Cell, he was putting up an impressive feat by holding back Cell, but that was all he was doing. He wasn’t damaging Cell, but he was holding him off from absorbing #18.\n\nI think the same can be said about Uub during his fight with Goku because the Majin-turned-human was putting up a good fight, but it was clear that the only damage he inflicted on Goku was on his clothes!\n\nWell, at the beginning of the fight he did make Goku’s arm tingle with a fierce kick. However, Goku underestimated Uub’s power, and remember Whis told him that letting his guard down makes even a body as powerful as his susceptible to damage from weaker opponents.\n\nSorbet’s Ring Laser proved that point to be true when he pierced Super Saiyan God Super Saiyan Goku’s heart!\n\nI actually think that Goku leaving with Uub would be even more touching since Whis (the Supreme Being) in Universe 7 ended up training a low-class Saiyan to become one of the best in the universe. This is like Goku sharing his skills with a young Indian boy from a poor village. The most unlikely people ended up learning from the best in the universe!\n\nHowever, I would still like DB Super to possibly continue even after Goku leaves with Uub so we can see what happens next!\n\nWhen you think about it, 5 years in DB time is not really that much. Keep in mind that the 3 years of training for the battle with the Androids was shown in a couple of episodes, but “skipped” in a single episode! Compare that to the “5 minutes” for Namek to explode, and that was stretched out for around a dozen episodes…\n\nDB Super is going to be doing some obvious time jumps, but I think it will be worth it. I am one of those fans that love to see things being covered and explained instead of skipped over.\n\nEver since I saw the picture of Gohan and Videl on their wedding day in Granddaughter Pan, I wanted to see those two being hitched! In the first episode of the new series, we learn that Goten is going to be looking for a gift because his brother’s wedding is happening soon.\n\nBased on Goku’s outfit while he is farming, I have a suspicion that Tarble will appear, and then we will jump to the events post-Battle of Gods. In the leaked manga chapter, we see Goku farming, Mr. Satan arriving with 100 million zeni for him, and Goku telling Goten that he wishes he could train with King Kai.\n\nIn the Tarble special, Goku asks Chi-Chi why they have to farm despite the fact that Mr. Satan had given them a ton of money. His wife explains that despite the money, they should still work to earn their own form of financial stability. I find that interesting because it was Goku who fought to save the universe from Buu (along with help from his friends of course), and Mr. Satan was returning the favor because he thought Goku deserved something out of it!\n\nAlso in the special, Mr. Satan invites all of the Z-Fighters to his new hotel opening in honor of him defeating Buu. Here is where we reach a form of contradiction from the main series.\n\nRemember that 4 months after the defeat of Kid Buu, Goku had Shenron erase the memories of Majin Buu from the minds of earthlings so Good Buu (Fat Buu or Mr. Buu) could live a peaceful life on earth.\n\nThe only way I could see the world still worshiping Mr. Satan would be for them to praise and award him during the 4 months between Kid Buu’s death and their minds being erased. They must have had plans for the hotel along with the other awards for him, but after the mind wipe it seems clear that they gave it to him anyway (despite not knowing what threat they were saved from).\n\nAnother thing to mention is the fact that Tarble was mentioned in Battle of Gods by Bulma. They were looking for a fifth Saiyan to help in the Super Saiyan God ritual, but they could not find one. Vegeta mentioned that his brother is in another star system, but he did not know which one.\n\nThis most likely means we will indeed see everyone meeting Tarble in the first part of DB Super.\n\nNot to mention we see Goku training on King Kai’s Planet in the new trailer, and this was also seen at the beginning of Battle of Gods. My guess is Chi-Chi loosened the chain on Goku since Mr. Satan gave them all of that money, and he was allowed to do some training.\n\nNow let’s talk about Beerus’ premonition about the Super Saiyan God possibly erasing Battle of Gods and Revival of Frieza out of the picture. Above is a photo from Chapter 1 of the DB Super manga, and it has driven fans insane!\n\nBeerus is on some alien planet, and he is having a feast. After revealing that he knew the inhabitants had poisoned his food (with no effect on him at all), he blew up their planet. He then talks to Whis about his dream about an opponent that would entertain him known as a Super Saiyan God.\n\nApparently, Beerus had just awoken from his 39 year slumber and was still a bit tired. Whis then suggests they go to their home world so he can remember his dream better.\n\nI thought that the Oracle Fish would be the key to the timeline. Why? Remember according to Beerus, it was the fish that told him that a Super Saiyan God would appear to give him a good fight and rival his power. He said that he would appear in 39 years, and that was why Beerus woke up “early” from his slumber because of the premonition from the Oracle Fish.\n\nAgain, it depends on the translation from the dub and manga because the Oracle Fish’s prophecy differs. One says that the fish foretold of the Super Saiyan God, but the other says that his prophecy was only that an unnamed opponent that would eventually become a rival to Beerus would appear. Then it was during a dream Beerus had while sleeping for 39 years that revealed the identity of his rival; a Super Saiyan God.\n\nOriginally, I thought this scene from the manga would be Beerus thinking about the prophecy the fish told him, he would sleep 39 years after Whis takes him home, and then he would reawaken during Battle of Gods.\n\nHowever, seeing Old Kai and Kibito Kai in the last panel shot that theory apart…\n\nOverall, it is inconsistent that Beerus apparently woke up earlier in DB Super than he did in Battle of Gods. I do not think that this one little thing will erase that movie and Revival of F from the continuity. It could be that Akira is simply changing things up a bit for something just a little different.\n\nI do find it interesting that in the beginning of Battle of Gods, when the Kais sense Beerus’ awakening, there is a wide shot of a distant galaxy, and what appears to be the remains of a destroyed planet.\n\nAfter that, we see that Old and Supreme Kai were watching the events unfold. Could those floating rocks in space be the remains of the alien world that Beerus destroyed in the DB Super manga, or were they simply just asteroids floating in space?\n\nJust something interesting to think about…\n\nFinally, I will simply talk about what I think will happen in the series. It has been revealed that a new character named Champa and a female-looking version of Whis will appear on Beerus’ planet.\n\nApparently he is also a God of Destruction, and he could be from one of the 11 other universes in the DB world.\n\nWhen he appears in DB Super has not yet been revealed, but my guess is either before Battle of Gods or after Revival of Frieza.\n\nI think it would be interesting for the series to allow us to see some of the 11 other universes. Considering Goku and Vegeta’s power is growing at an impressive rate, it seems clear that they may soon surpass Beerus with their individual power.\n\nNot sure how long it would take for them to ever pass Whis, but at some point I think that they will. Regardless as to whether it is through them working together or fusing. Since the series is set to be 100 episodes (and maybe more), I have no doubt that other gods from the other universes will appear! Beerus even said in Battle of Gods that some of those universes spawned beings that were more powerful than he and Whis.\n\nWe all know that Goku thrives for fighting more powerful opponents, and Vegeta will not allow himself to be outdone by that low-level clown!\n\nCould DB Super be similar to the web comic DB Multiverse, and we will see a huge tournament between other DB universes?\n\nEither way, I think that the series has a lot of potential, and I am looking forward to it. I really hope that it is not like GT because I want all of the characters to shine in DB Super! GT was pretty much “Goku Time” and made everyone else weak.\n\nIn DB Super, fans fear that with opponents like gods and other powerful beings, Goku and Vegeta will be the ONLY ones who have a chance to oppose them.\n\nThis means that everyone else in the show like Super Gotenks, Piccolo and Ultimate Gohan would not stand a chance. Given their performance in Revival of Frieza (minus Gotenks)…this might be the case.\n\nI want to see a teenage/adult Gotenks, Piccolo reaching a new level of power, and Gohan not being written to be a weakling when he is one of the most powerful beings in the universe!\n\nThere are so many twists and turns that this new series can travel down, but I will remain a fan and view it! I do not want to be one of those fans who give the series a thumbs down before it even airs because I want this to be great. The main reason for the series being revived is because of its popularity that is being kept alive by the fans.\n\nWith that being said, what do you think about this theory? How far will DB Super go? Will it continue up until the end of DBZ when Goku leaves with Uub? Will this erase the final 3 episodes of DBZ completely, and create something new? Do you think we will see the other 11 universes?\n\nLike what you read? Be sure to follow my blog, and you will be able to read my past blogs about the Dragon Ball series!

Be sure to pass it along to your friends, and I look forward to your thoughts in the comment section below.\n\nBy Jeremy Carden\n\nSibling rivalry is something that exists in both the real world and the fictional world. Needless to say, Dragon Ball fans were excited to see a particular tyrant of the past return to the franchise with new power.\n\nConsidering that Frieza and his father King Cold existed in both the anime and manga, they are both considered to be canon characters within the DB universe.\n\nHowever, Cooler was only present in DBZ movies like Cooler’s Revenge, and those movies are not considered to be canon at all.\n\nHe is even briefly seen in Dragon Ball GT, but of course that series is considered non-cannon.\n\nLet me pause for a moment to address certain DB fans who read my blog…\n\nIf you see non-canon material as irrelevant, and nothing important to write about; there is no need for you to read this blog. I say this not to be rude, but it gets tiresome to see numerous comments that have nothing to do with the topic at hand. Some readers will simply read the title of the blog, say “It’s non-canon! Why does this even matter?” without even bothering to read through what I wrote!\n\nFor anyone who feels that way about this particular topic, I did not write this for you!\n\nI am a huge fan of Cooler, and despite being “non-canon” he is one of my favorite villains from the franchise!\n\n*Rant over*\n\nMoving on, fans have been wondering if Cell could obtain a “Golden Form” since he has the cells of Frieza inside of him. That is an interesting subject in itself, but I would much rather focus on Cooler’s potential in this post.\n\nConsidering he is Frieza’s older brother, you would expect him to be able to do anything that Frieza can do, but even better.\n\nI mean in Cooler’s Revenge, he proved to be superior to Frieza because he mastered his “true form” which allowed him to unlock an even higher power (5th form).\n\nHe once again outdoes his brother in Return of Cooler, and his new Meta-Cooler body was far more impressive than Mecha Frieza!\n\nHowever, Frieza finally surpasses his brother with his Golden Frieza form as a result of his Ultimate Evolution technique.\n\nFans are curious as to whether or not Cooler could obtain the same level of power as Golden Frieza, and if he could surpass even that!\n\nThere was one particular piece of dialogue from Cooler’s Revenge that caught my attention. Based off of this one line, I feel that Frieza was indeed the superior Frost Demon when compared to his brother.\n\nBefore transforming (in the FUNimation dub), Cooler was telling Goku that he was impressed by his power. He understood how his little brother could have been defeated by the Saiyan. Cooler goes onto say that he considered Frieza to be nothing more than a pest because he was constantly trying to defeat his brother in order to prove that he was the best.\n\nFinally, he says that Frieza definitely had the edge, but that was until Cooler reached a new form!\n\nAlthough he never says the line about Frieza having the edge in the original Japanese dub, that one piece of dialogue (at least to me) was kind of a foreshadowing to what Frieza said after being brought back to life in Revival of F. He expresses the fact that he was born as a prodigy, but never trained a day of his life.\n\nAfter dedicating 4 months to nonstop training, he obtained a power that surpassed Majin Buu, the Super Saiyan God Super Saiyans and would possibly rival Beerus (well the 70% power Beerus that we saw in Battle of Gods, but maybe not Beerus at full power). Beerus and Buu were the two beings that King Cold warned his son never to provoke.\n\nThis goes back to a statement that Akira Toriyama made regarding the powers of both Frieza and King Cold:\n\n“Among Frieza’s race only Frieza and Cold had such incredible levels of power. It was also stated by Naho Ooishi in an interview for Resurrection ‘F’ that even though the rest of Frieza’s family are strong, Frieza’s power has always been in a completely different league from them, and that he alone is the only one who possess this level of power.”\n\nWith that being said, I feel that Cooler has potential, but not to the extreme extent that Frieza does. Power aside, you have to admit that Cooler is far more strategic, patient and smarter than Frieza.\n\nTo him, Frieza was nothing more than a spoiled brat that would go to their father whenever he did not have his way.\n\nOverall, you could say that Frieza was more of a short-term goal being, but his brother was driven by his long-term goals.\n\nThis goes back to Cooler feeling that Goku’s escape from Planet Vegeta’s destruction would come back to haunt Frieza someday.\n\nOf course, this turned out to be true! However, the same happened to Cooler because he did not intercept the Saiyan’s ship when he had the chance either.\n\nI think that Cooler might be able to achieve some sort of power that would exceed his 5th form or Meta-Cooler power. However, based on the above statements, he would not be able to get a power-up as incredible as Frieza did after only 4 months of training because Frieza just has a natural ability that surpasses the rest of the Frost Demons.\n\nLet’s just imagine Cooler gaining a new power, I do not think that it would look like a “Golden Cooler.” Frieza even states that his “Golden Frieza” form was based off the Super Saiyan transformation, and this hints at his ability to manipulate his body color to whatever he imagined it to be. That is really cool when you think about it!\n\nSomething tells me that Cooler would find a way to make his new body look like something far more impressive than Golden Frieza in every way.\n\nAgain, it goes back to his Meta-Cooler body looking more sleek and complete than Mecha Frieza.\n\nOverall, the creator(s) of the series pretty much put into place the fact that Frieza had a potential that surpasses the rest of his family. However, if he had had a level-head, more skills as a martial artist, etc. Frieza would truly be a fearsome threat. Similar to the Saiyan race, he lets his ego get in the way of the matter at hand leading to his defeat time and time again.\n\nWith that being said, would you like to see Cooler join the ranks of canon characters in Dragon Ball Super? Do you think he could gain some form of an Ultimate Evolution like his brother? Do you prefer Cooler over Frieza?\n\nLike what you read?

Be sure to pass it along to your friends, and I look forward to your thoughts in the comment section below.\n\nBy Jeremy Carden\n\nI have been puzzled by this question ever since I watched Battle of Gods, and read an article about an interview with Akira Toriyama regarding Majin Buu’s origins.\n\nWhen asked about Buu’s origins, Akira said this:\n\n“Though in the manga Kaiōshin said that Bibidi made him, the truth is that one called “Buu” was not actually created by Bididi, but has existed since time immemorial. He cycled between rampages and long hibernation. During numerous iterations of this cycle, he absorbed the evil elements of mankind, becoming steadily more violent. Bibidi merely knew the means of calling Buu from out of his long slumber. Since the current Buu is a slightly different life-form due to the changes brought about when the evil Buu was expelled, it’s not known whether he’ll still go into long hibernation.”\n\nI was surprised by this information because it adds an entirely new dimension on how Buu came to be the Majin that fans know best.\n\nNow, it is time to get down to the theory itself on how Kid Buu might be connected to Whis.\n\nOriginally, I thought that Whis was the God of Creation because Beerus was the God of Destruction.\n\nHowever, this was not the case because Akira actually stated that it was the Supreme Kais who were responsible for the creation of planets, and Beerus was the being responsible for the destruction of planets and star systems.\n\nKing Kai told Goku that both forms of life are needed in the universe in order to maintain balance.\n\nAlright, so it has been established that the Supreme Kais and Beerus are more or less responsible for different roles in the universe to balance things out, and Whis is pretty much the supreme being above all else in Universe 7 (the universe that we know of from DBZ).\n\nWhat does this have to do with Kid Buu?\n\nBased on Akira’s origins for the character, Buu seemed to have come out of nothingness. You might compare Buu to the Big Bang Theory, and how the universe came from an incredible explosion that seemed to have come from nowhere. However, something had to have triggered that big bang, and I am thinking that the same could have been true about Buu’s existence.\n\nMy theory is that Whis created Kid Buu BEFORE the role (or job) of “God of Destruction” was a position that existed in Universe 7.\n\nBuu does not have a date in which he came into existence, and it was mentioned that he has existed since time immemorial. This means that Buu is so old that it is almost generally accepted (or hinted at by Akira) that Buu has existed since the dawn of time.\n\nLet’s say that Whis created Buu, but where did the Kais come from?\n\nAkira said this when asked about how one becomes a Supreme Kai (supposedly the highest status in the universe):\n\n“No one can. Kaiōshin are born as Kaiōshin. There are three of them, and they work in shifts. Though there are two of them on duty now, if one of the Kaiōshin were to die in an accident, then the currently-inactive Kaiōshin would grow in the Kaiōshin Realm like a plant. If there aren’t any accidents, then it’s said their life spans are about 75,000 years.”\n\nConsidering the life of a Supreme Kai is around 75,000 years, it could mean that Buu was pretty much close to being an immortal because there was only 1 of him.\n\nHowever, it also makes sense that there would be multiple overseers of the universe because of different quadrants. That is where East, North, West and South Kai come into play.\n\nThink of it like this:\n\nThe Supreme Kais are the Gods of Creation and oversee both the living and other world. The lower Kais (King Kai and his 3 counterparts) guard and oversee the living world.\n\nDoes it seem fair that there is only one being on destruction (Buu), but there are multiple Kais who have the ability to make worlds?\n\nSomething tells me that 1 creature of destruction was enough, and the Kais probably were not making planets just for the sake of making them. I am sure that Whis might have had some word in how much could be created, or felt that Buu was more than enough to keep the planet total in check.\n\nAnyway, I think the most interesting part of Akira’s description of Buu was the concept of Buu not being the evil maniac that we saw in DBZ.\n\nHe describes Buu as cycling between rampages and long hibernation. During numerous iterations of this cycle, he absorbed the evil elements of mankind, becoming steadily more violent.\n\nThis sounds very similar to the origins of the Original Nameless Namek! Remember that he arrived on earth due to the storms on Namek that were on the verge of destroying the entire planet. However, the storms ended after the Namek was sent to earth. He waited years and years for his people to follow him, but they never came. During his time on earth, he watched the evilness of mankind and slowly began to adapt those traits in his personality.\n\nFrom there, the Namek eventually had to surrender the evilness in his heart (that was “born” through his interactions and visuals of mankind) in order to become Guardian of the Earth.\n\nThat was how Kami became the good-hearted overseer of Earth, and the pure evil King Piccolo came into existence.\n\nAgain, this goes back to Buu’s origins! He was a being that seemed to be created for nothing more than destruction that resulted from his rampages.\n\nSimilar to the Nameless Namek, it seems that during his rampages, Buu picked up characteristics from mankind (apparently the worst traits); sadistic, murderous, insane and other negative aspects of the living.\n\nNot to mention that like the Namek, Buu eventually split into a good and an evil half.\n\nI will touch on this more when we eventually get to Buu coming into contact with the wizard Bibidi.\n\nIt appears that Buu was a being that helped to keep the balance between creation and destruction in check. This sounds very similar to the role of “God of Destruction.” After those long rampages, he would go into his ball for a long duration of hibernation.\n\nThis mirrors the pattern of Beerus because he destroys planets as a way of making sure that there is balance in the universe, but then goes into long periods of hibernation. Whis is there to keep Beerus in check, and appears to keep the purple kitty from needless acts of destruction.\n\nNow we will throw Bibidi into the equation! Originally, it was believed that this midget wizard was the one responsible for creating Buu. On the contrary, Bibidi knew of the spell that could release Buu from his ball during his hibernation cycle to recharge his batteries so to speak.\n\nFrom there, he turned Kid Buu into Majin Buu. The pink powerhouse was no longer a natural universal tool for balance. He was now a minion for an insane wizard. It is true that Bibidi did not have full control over Buu, but he was using him for his own means.\n\nGalactic domination was the goal of Bibidi, and with Buu’s power at his disposal; he could have achieved what he was trying to obtain.\n\nFirst off, the Supreme Kais were on his hit list. We all know the story of how Buu killed the North and West Supreme Kais.\n\nAfter that, Buu absorbed South Kai and the Grand Supreme Kai. This resulted in Kid Buu becoming the Buff and the Fat Majin Buu that we saw when he was released from his ball during the Majin Buu Saga.\n\nWe also know that the Eastern Supreme Kai eventually became the Supreme Kai that oversaw the entire universe.\n\nIt is not mentioned when the “lower Kais” were born, but I wager that those Kais (King Kai-level Kais) came into existence after Buu absorbed and killed the Supreme Kais.\n\nThat seems to make the most sense considering that Supreme Kai would have been the only Kai alive to do the job. King Kai and his 3 other counterparts could have been born to oversee the lower realm to assist Supreme Kai. They may have also assisted with planet creation as well.\n\nOf course, this is just my own personal speculation of it all, but it interesting anyway you look at it.\n\nLet’s backtrack to when Old Kai was trapped inside of the Z-Sword because I think it adds another interesting piece to the possible connection between Buu and Beerus.\n\nAkira said this about Old Kai:\n\n“The Kaiōshin (who create planets) and the Gods of Destruction (who destroy them) have never gotten along that well, but once every 1,000 years they go to each other’s realms and hold a coordination meeting. At this time, they got into an argument over some trifling thing, and a certain short-tempered God of Destruction sealed Elder Kaiōshin away inside a sword. Naturally, it wouldn’t have been proper for him to destroy the Kaiōshin Realm itself. By the way, that God of Destruction was Beerus.”\n\nWhen he was released from the sword, Old Kai mentioned that there was a terrible villain that trapped him inside of the sword. This being was jealous of his awesome magical capabilities, and he tricked Old Kai!\n\nThe dialogue that caught my attention was that “this villain” was not as terrible as Majin Buu, but still pretty bad!\n\nAs mentioned above, this “villain” who trapped Old Kai in the Z-Sword was none other than Beerus!\n\nOld Kai’s statement could imply 1 of 2 things:\n\nBeerus was not as terrible as Majin Buu because at that point in time, Beerus may have not been as powerful as Kid Buu.\n\nBeerus was not as terrible as Majin Buu because he was not an insane destroyer. He had some reasoning and sense of right/wrong. Though he has short tempter, and will destroy a solar system when angered, Old Kai might not have seen Beerus in the same realm of “evil” as Buu.\n\nWait, how could the God of Destruction potentially be weaker than Kid Buu?\n\nConsidering that Buu was possibly in existence since the beginning of time, it makes sense that Old Kai during his time (15 generations ago when compared to the Eastern Supreme Kai-turned Supreme Kai) knew of the terrible evil menace rampaging around the universe.\n\nWe do not know the origins of Beerus, but I do not think he was always the all-powerful being that we saw in Battle of Gods. Keep in mind that I think he was selected by Whis to become the God of Destruction, but during his initial acceptance of the job, he may not have been all that powerful.\n\nMaybe there is some kind of ritual that takes place that allows one to become a God of Destruction just like there is a ritual for a Super Saiyan God to appear.\n\nAfter Beerus became a god, Whis became his fighting instructor and overseer. He might have taught him in the ways of combat, but Whis was still unable to teach Beerus to control that temper and sense of entitlement.\n\nSimilar to Ying and Yang, it makes sense that the Gods of Creation and the God of Destruction would not get along. I wonder what kind of argument caused Old Kai to be trapped in the Z-Sword.\n\nDepending on what dub you watched, Beerus destroyed King Kai’s once huge planet due to losing a video game or playing hide-and-seek. That was why King Kai’s planet was so small when we first saw it in the Saiyan Saga.\n\nWith that being said, I am sure that Beerus got enraged over nothing. That was how the Old Kai was trapped. Old Kai said that he was 15 generations before Supreme Kai. Considering that each Supreme Kai has a lifespan of about 75,000 years that means that Old Kai was possibly trapped in the sword around 1,125,000 years before he was released! I got that number by simply multiplying 15 times 75,000.\n\nIn terms of power, we know that Kid Buu is on par with a Super Saiyan 3 Goku.\n\nAt the beginning of Battle of Gods, Beerus defeated Super Saiyan 3 Goku with a pluck to the forehead and a karate chop to the neck.\n\nI think that it goes without saying that Beerus is in an entirely different realm of power than Kid Buu!\n\nIt all goes back on how you interpret the Old Kai’s statement of Beerus being less terrible than Buu. Whether it was in regards to his power or temperament is all based on perspective. This is very similar to the fan interpretation of Old Kai comparing the Fusion Dance to the Potara Earrings.\n\nMaybe Beerus was powerful, but not Kid Buu-level in terms of strength during the time when he trapped Old Kai in the Z-Sword?\n\nAgain, that is left to speculation…\n\nIn any case, I think this theory can be summed up by Bibidi’s spell over Buu. I think that if Whis was truly the one who created Buu, he did so with the intention of Buu hibernating.\n\nDo you really think that Whis would create a being that would rampage endlessly throughout the universe without giving it an off switch? I don’t think that he would, and that is why I think Whis created Buu with his batteries needing to be recharged through hibernation in his ball.\n\nConsidering that Beerus isn’t immortal because Whis offered Goku the position of God of Destruction after Beerus eventually died, I think it is safe to say that Buu existed before Beerus.\n\nAnother possible scenario is that Buu and Beerus had hibernation cycles that occurred at different times. Perhaps Beerus would be sleeping while Buu was rampaging, and vice versa.\n\nThe flaw in that theory would be an endless cycle of destruction that would occur because of 2 powerful beings…\n\nNot to mention that Beerus considered 39 years of sleeping as nothing more than a catnap. I think Buu’s hibernation cycles were extremely longer than that. However, when Bibidi (and later Babidi) got Buu under one of his spells, Buu would not hibernate for long. He was sealed up whenever Bibidi felt that Buu was slipping out of control or when he needed to rest.\n\nPerhaps Whis felt that as long as Buu was destroying planets (even while under a wizard’s control) that it was helping to keep balance.\n\nI know that makes Whis sound kind of like an uncaring parent, but really these “gods” aren’t exactly as all-knowing as their job descriptions may have you believe…\n\nThat could be why Whis actually trained Beerus (and possibly the other Gods of Destruction before him), and kept watch over him instead of letting him rampage across the universe like Buu.\n\nOne might assume that Whis saw the results of leaving a being of powerful destructive capabilities (Buu) unchecked could result in terrible results. I mean Buu literally wiped out the Kais, and that pretty much ruined some of the universal balance.\n\nYou are probably wondering why Whis did not recognize “his creation” during Battle of Gods when he was hogging the pudding cups.\n\nRemember that Old Kai was sealed in the sword by Beerus prior to Kid Buu becoming Fat Buu. It could be that after Beerus (or whoever the first God of Destruction was) entered the god-ranking as the being of destruction, Whis left Buu to his own means.\n\nHe probably figured Buu was on a ranking like King Kai and his other counterparts, and Beerus was now on the level of Supreme Kai(s). Both races were in check of creation and destruction with lower beings to assist with their job.\n\nFrom there, Whis was not aware that Kid Buu had evolved into Fat Buu, and that was why he took notice of “that pink gentleman” instead of calling him Majin Buu.\n\nRegardless as to whether or not my theory is true, I think that it is a very interesting topic to think about.\n\nAlso, here is a link to the interview with Akira Toriyama: http://www.kanzenshuu.com/translations/saikyo-jump-june-2014-issue-twel-buu-mysteries/.\n\nWhat do you think about this theory? Was Buu created by Whis before the position of God of Destruction was introduced, or did he “naturally” come into the existence from the universe itself? Was Buu at one point in time more powerful than Beerus?\n\nLike what you read? Be sure to follow my blog, and you will be able to read my past blogs about the Dragon Ball series!

Be sure to pass it along to your friends, and I look forward to your thoughts in the comment section below.\n\nBy Jeremy Carden\n\nThere is a battle that has caused a lot of tension within the fan base of the Dragon Ball series. I have seen many blogs and videos about this particular subject. Fans have debated about Gogeta vs. Vegito, Kid Buu vs. Super Buu (Ultimate Gohan absorbed) and Goku vs. Superman.\n\nHowever, the topic of this blog will focus on the ultimate battle between Goku and Gohan.\n\nWhile reading this blog, please remember that I will be discussing Super Saiyan 3 Goku and Ultimate Gohan (also called Mystic Gohan by some fans) from the Majin Buu Saga.\n\nThis blog will not include anything between the time of Kid Buu’s death and the ending of DBZ when Goku leaves with Uub.\n\nThat means nothing about Super Saiyan God or Dragon Ball GT will be included in this blog.\n\nLet’s get this battle started! As with most of my “Who would win?” blogs, I will start this one by expressing my thoughts right off the bat. I feel that in terms of power alone; Gohan is the winner.\n\nDoes that mean he would win? Yes…and no. Just because Gohan is more powerful than Goku does not mean that he would win.\n\nAt this point, some readers are probably shaking their heads at my belief that Ultimate Gohan is more powerful than Super Saiyan 3 Goku.\n\nBefore I go any further, I just want to say that this blog is based on my own personal opinion. If you feel that Goku is more powerful than Gohan then you are entitled to your opinion. From this point on in the blog, I will attempt to use facts from the manga AND anime in order to get my point across. I would love to hear your thoughts in the comments below after finishing this blog, and you can tell me if I have persuaded you that Gohan is more powerful.\n\nBelieve it or not, when it comes down to determining which warrior is more powerful; you have to examine which form of Majin Buu is more powerful. The 2 Buus that I am talking about are Super Buu and Kid Buu.\n\nThe reason that I picked out these forms of Buu is because they are the Buus that Goku and Gohan battled the hardest against.\n\nIf you have ever read my very first DBZ blog about which form of Buu is the most powerful, then you know that I feel that Super Buu (Ultimate Gohan absorbed) is the strongest, and Kid Buu is far from #1.\n\nIn any case, we know that Kid Buu and Super Saiyan 3 Goku are more or less equals. It was mentioned that if Goku had started off the fight at 100%, and did not hold back so that Vegeta would have a chance to fight; he could have killed Kid Buu.\n\nHe mentioned the same about his battle with Fat Buu, but in that case he was not holding back for Vegeta’s sake. In that fight, he was holding back in order for Gohan, Goten and Trunks to have a shot at fighting for the planet. However, unlike the battle with Kid Buu, it was clear that he was holding back (a lot) during his fight with Fat Buu. He did not battle to the point of exhausted as he did against Kid Buu.\n\nWhen talking about two fighters who were more or less equals, Super Buu and Super Saiyan 3 Gotenks seem to fit that category very nicely. Gotenks was playing around with Buu during their fight, and it was literally a back and forth conflict. Each fighter was able to take a blow, and dish one back out to their opponent! You could argue that Buu was holding back because he was waiting for Gohan to arrive, but it is clear he and Gotenks were on the same plateau of power.\n\nIt was Buu’s regeneration powers and endurance that kept the young Super Saiyan 3 from putting him down for the count. However, when Gotenks was about to kill Buu for good, his power ran out and his Fusion ended.\n\nAlright, so we know that Goku and Gotenks had the power to completely annihilate the pink menace that they battled against. They just held back for different reasons; Goku for his respect of Vegeta’s pride, and Gotenks’ cocky nature.\n\nThis leads us to Goku’s comment to Vegeta before they escaped from Super Buu’s head. He mentioned that neither of them could survive if Buu fought them after leaving his body. Fusion was the only way that he and Vegeta would stand a chance.\n\nGoku was literally saying that he was NOT powerful enough to destroy Super Buu if they had to battle him!\n\nRemember that Ultimate Gohan mopped the floor with Super Buu. He did not even use ki attacks against the pink titan, he was using nothing but melee attacks to push Buu into a corner.\n\nThis leads to another point about how powerful Buu became after absorbing Gotenks and Piccolo. We have established that Gohan is more powerful than Super Buu, and this means he is clearly more powerful than Gotenks.\n\nHe took Buu apart without much effort, but Gotenks was literally kept on his toes by Buu’s power. So, after absorbing Gotenks, we can assume that Buu’s power pretty much doubled in power.\n\nI think we can conclude that Buu’s absorption technique is a power-up that takes the person(s) absorbed, and adds their power to Buu’s.\n\nWith that being said, “Buutenks” had a power that was over double what it was before. Keep in mind that Buu and Super Saiyan 3 Gotenks were pretty much even, and he took Piccolo’s power too (though the Namek’s absorption was more about adding his intelligence to Buu rather than his overall power).\n\nIn the anime, Gohan and Buu were on par with each other. It was not until Buu starting using “the Piccolo in him” to chip away at Gohan’s confidence, and that led to him being completely overpowered.\n\nUnlike the anime, the manga portrayal of Buutenks vs. Gohan was showing Buu’s power to be something that Gohan stood absolutely no chance against.\n\nIt appears that Gohan was indeed superior to Buu and Gotenks, but less than twice their power. I would say that he was probably somewhere between 1.2-1.5 times more powerful than Super Buu and Super Saiyan 3 Gotenks.\n\nWhere does this leave Goku?\n\nAnother blog that I wrote awhile back was concerning the subject of Super Gotenks’ power compared to Goku’s. In that blog, I talked about my thoughts on how even a Super Saiyan 1 Gotenks had power that was superior to Super Saiyan 3 Goku.\n\nWhy would I say that?\n\nRemember that Goku originally declined killing the Fat Buu because he wanted the boys to save the world instead of relying on him (since he was dead, Goku did not feel it was his right to step in as a savior to the planet).\n\nHe taught the boys the Fusion Dance, and felt that it would be the ONLY way of defeating Buu. Trunks asked why he did not teach them Super Saiyan 3 because if he and Goten teamed up at that level then they would beat Buu for sure. However, Goku told them that Fusion was the ONLY way.\n\nAfter seeing how sad they were, he showed them Super Saiyan 3 before leaving with Baba. In my opinion, I feel that Goku thought that Goten and Trunks fused as Super Saiyans would be enough to defeat Buu (without the need for a Super Saiyan 3 transformation). Goku knew that level 3 was something not meant to be used in the living world due to the rapid ki depletion that it causes for the user outside of other world.\n\nConsidering that he had just fought Buu himself at Super Saiyan 3, I think that Goku knew for a fact that a Super Saiyan 1 Fusion would be enough to kill Buu. This means that it is safe to conclude that Super Saiyan Gotenks (pre-Time Chamber) was in the same realm of power as Super Saiyan 3 Goku!\n\nLet’s take things a step further in order to analyze just how powerful Gotenks was. After training in the Time Chamber for 30 minutes on the outside world before Super Buu lost his patience (which equals just about 7 and a half days inside of the Hyperbolic Time Chamber), Gotenks’ power was said to have increased dramatically.\n\nI think that if there was a gap between pre-Time Chamber Super Saiyan Gotenks and Super Saiyan 3 Goku; that gap was closed after the children’s 7.5 days of training.\n\nI dare say that Gotenks may have become even more powerful than Super Saiyan 3 Goku. By how much was never determined, but for the sake of simplicity (without downplaying either of their power levels), let’s say that Super Saiyan 1 Gotenks and Super Saiyan 3 Goku were even.\n\nGoing Super Saiyan 2 doubles the power of a Super Saiyan 1, and going Super Saiyan 3 multiples the power of a Super Saiyan 2 by four.\n\nSuper Saiyan 3 Gotenks (at minimum) is 8 times more powerful than Super Saiyan 3 Goku!\n\nUltimate Gohan is stronger than Super Saiyan 3 Gotenks (who is more or less on the same playing field as Super Buu), but not twice as powerful.\n\nOverall, Goku is not as powerful as Gotenks and Gohan. However, his original goal of having the boys measure up to their destinies as the protectors of the planet was realized. His intention was making them even more powerful than he was in order to save the earth from Buu.\n\nThis same goal was similar to Goku’s plans of having Gohan exceed his power to save the world from Cell.\n\nNot to mention that Piccolo’s goal during the Saiyan Saga was training Gohan to become more powerful than him as well!\n\nIn any case, I think I have spelled out why I feel that Ultimate Gohan’s power is clearly superior to his father’s even at Super Saiyan 3.\n\nConsidering that Gohan is more powerful than his dad, you are probably wondering whether or not Gohan would be named as the winner before the battle even began.\n\nI say that despite being more powerful, Gohan would not easily win the battle. This is mainly due to Goku being the superior fighter.\n\nLooking back at the DBZ series, I feel that Gohan’s power and combat skills were at their peak during the Cell Games.\n\nTrue, Old Kai unlocked ALL of his hidden powers, but that would not unlock his combat skills and fighting instincts.\n\nVegeta mentioned that Gohan’s power was a lot higher as a child, and this was when he witnessed Gohan power up to show Kibito the Super Saiyan 2 level.\n\nWhile watching his son fight with Dabura, Goku even brings up the fact that Gohan’s fighting sense was lost during his 7 years of no training.\n\nAfter the battle with Cell, Gohan pretty much neglected his training in favor of studying. The end result was that his 11-year-old persona was more powerful both in strength and in fighting abilities.\n\nCompare this to Goku, he trained for 7 years straight against warriors from across space and time during his stay on the Grand Kai’s planet.\n\nBefore he slacked off in his training, Gohan knew everything that his father had to teach him. Their training in the Hyperbolic Time Chamber allowed Gohan to pick up on his father’s technique and surpass his power.\n\nIf Ultimate Gohan fought against Super Saiyan 3 Goku, I’d say that Goku would be able to not only predict what Gohan would do next, but outsmart him as well during combat. Goku taught Gohan nearly everything that he knows about fighting.\n\nPiccolo was the only other person to train Gohan. Krillin and Gohan did “mind training” on their trip to Namek, but we know that his father and “Big Green Uncle” were his primary instructors.\n\nKeep in mind that Goku spent 3 years training alongside Gohan and Piccolo. This means that he has seen everything that Gohan knows about fighting and enhanced his son’s skills in the Time Chamber.\n\nAgain, Gohan is more powerful, but Goku has been able to hold his own against more powerful opponents in the past.\n\nIt has also been shown many times that if Goku is backed into a corner, he is capable of reaching incredible new levels of power.\n\nOf course, we know that Gohan does the same, and that goes to show he is indeed the son of Goku.\n\nAside from strength, Gohan has one huge advantage over Super Saiyan 3 Goku that has not yet been mentioned. Gohan’s power would not deplete as quickly as Super Saiyan 3 Goku!\n\nRemember that Goku admitted to Vegeta that even though he can go Super Saiyan 3; he can only hold the form for a short amount of time.\n\nFor fans who say that Super Saiyan 3 Goku is more powerful than Ultimate Gohan, I ask you this one question: Could Goku defeat his son before his Super Saiyan 3 power depletes?\n\nWith a well placed Warp Kamehameha, I think that he could deal some heavy damage. Either way, I think this would be a tough battle.\n\nSuper Saiyan Goku was holding his own so against Ultimate Gohan…well it was Buu’s thought form of Ultimate Gohan. Not to mention it was a filler scene, but I wanted to mention this because I know someone would say something about it in the comment section.\n\nSomething to remember about this fight was that Goku was getting exhausted, but Gohan was a thought form meaning that he could not be damaged or weakened so their battle is not really something to be used as solid evidence for this subject.\n\nUltimate Gohan’s power is his maximum potential brought out to the surface, and it does not deplete his ki supply like a Super Saiyan 3 transformation would. Goku even says that Gohan’s power was higher than it was ever was even when his son was a Super Saiyan.\n\nThe one moment that we could have and should have seen these 2 fighting was right after Gohan powered up after Old Kai unlocked his potential.\n\nJust as Goku showed Goten and Trunks how to go Super Saiyan 3 before going back to the land of the dead, I think he should have battled Gohan before his son returned to the land of the living.\n\nWould have been a great touch as to how Goku shows his love for his children in the best way that he knows how.\n\nBuutenks reverting back to Buuccolo was another moment in the anime and manga that differed. In the anime, Goku was at Super Saiyan 3, but was doing what he could just to keep up with Buu. Fans argue that he was stalling for Gohan to find the Potara Earring. In the manga, this “fight” never happened; Buutenks went to Buuccolo without fighting Goku.\n\nHowever, for fans who think Goku was more powerful than Buutenks: why would Goku want or need to permanently fuse with Ultimate Gohan…if he had the power to do it solo?\n\nIn the manga and anime, Goku states that Gohan could defeat Buuccolo all by himself. The way he says that does seem to imply that Goku was disappointed in Buu’s drastic drop in power. I mean Goku was in a tense situation because he was desperate to fuse with Gohan, but now he was in a position where fusion was not needed because Gohan could win alone.\n\nReally it is all up to personal interpretation about how Goku said what he said about Gohan beating Buu. I will admit that it does seem like Goku is saying that he could take Buu himself, but really I just do not think that this is the case.\n\nOne last piece of evidence that fans like to bring up is the fact that Goku’s Ki was sensed from the Sacred Land of the Kais from Earth.\n\nHowever, when Gohan unleashed his new power, Buu was the ONLY person in the lower realm (Earth) to take notice of his power.\n\nI think that ki sensing somehow works in reverse when it comes to comparing the lower realm (land of the living) and the other world (land of the dead).\n\nOn Supreme Kai’s planet, it makes sense that they could sense an extremely high power level from earth. However, it also makes sense that an extremely high power from the Kai planet could not be sensed from earth.\n\nRemember that in the anime, Goku mentioned that Kid Buu was using Instant Transmission. That was how he found other planets with high ki readings during his hunt for Goku and Vegeta.\n\nIn the manga, it was mentioned that he was using the “Kai Kai” or Instantaneous Moment used by Kibito Kai. This is a teleporting technique that does not require a ki signature for the user to transport to. This explains how in the manga, Kid Buu regenerated from his Planet Burst move on earth, and then went instantly to Supreme Kai’s planet to fight the Saiyans.\n\nCompared to the anime, Kid Buu sensed Goku and Vegeta when they raised their power levels to draw Buu to their location. He was on Grand Kai’s planet during that moment, and it made sense that he could track their powers since he was in the other world just as they were.\n\nWhat does this have to do with Buu sensing Gohan’s power from earth? Well Super Buu is an interesting being because he detected Gohan’s power, but Piccolo nor the boys (Goten and Trunks) were able to sense it. Perhaps it is because he is a powerful being that he could track a power that a Namek could not? Either way, it could be because Gohan was in the middle of a magical ceremony that his power was more “contained” when he unleashed it when compared to a Super Saiyan transformation.\n\nI mean Gohan was on the verge of damaging the Kai planet by powering up, and Goku was on the verge of ripping apart the earth. The main difference was that Goku was not using Super Saiyan 3 for the first time, and he was “putting on a show” in order to stall for Trunks to find the Dragon Radar.\n\nWe later saw that he could go Super Saiyan 3 in an instant as he did against Buutenks.\n\nGohan was doing the “Super Saiyan thing” as Old Kai put it in order to unleash his true power. So, I can see why the lower realm would have a difficult time tracking a high ki signature from the land of the dead.\n\nHow else can you explain no one on earth sensing Goku’s power when he first unlocked Super Saiyan 3 during his time on Grand Kai’s planet?\n\nIn the end, I think that Gohan has the power to win, but Goku has the skill to stay alive until he finds a weakness in Gohan’s defenses in order to land some powerful hits.\n\nWhat do you think about this? Do you feel that Gohan’s power is superior, or does Super Saiyan 3 Goku have the power to surpass his son?\n\nLike what you read?

Be sure to pass it along to your friends, and I look forward to your thoughts in the comment section below.\n\nBy Jeremy Carden\n\nSince Battle of Gods, DBZ fans have been debating about Super Saiyan 4 vs. Super Saiyan God.\n\nWith the new Super Saiyan God Super Saiyan transformation revealed, the debated has sparked even more controversy. Despite the ongoing debate between fans, there has been no clear definitive answer as to which form is superior.\n\nMost fans are quick to say that it does not matter how powerful Super Saiyan 4 is because GT is not canon. Not to mention with Dragon Ball Super on the horizon, it is set to “erase” GT from existence. I will get into my thoughts on that in another blog, but for now the focus will be on which Super Saiyan transformation is superior.\n\nIt has never been fully established how powerful these new forms are when compared to the standard Super Saiyan forms. Which forms am I referring to?\n\nThese 3 below:\n\nSuper Saiyan God\n\nSaiyan beyond God\n\nSuper Saiyan God Super Saiyan\n\nHere is what we do know about the standard Super Saiyan forms:\n\nSuper Saiyan 1 is 50 times more powerful than base form\n\nSuper Saiyan 2 is twice the power of a Super Saiyan (100 times base form)\n\nSuper Saiyan 3 is four times more powerful than Super Saiyan 2 (400 times base form)\n\nSuper Saiyan 4 is ten times more powerful than Super Saiyan 3 (4000 times base form)\n\nThe missing factor in all of this involves how much more powerful Super Saiyan God is when compared to Super Saiyan 3.\n\nWe know that Beerus took out Super Saiyan 3 Goku with a simple flick to the forehead, and a well placed karate chop to a pressure point on Goku’s neck.\n\nHowever, Beerus tried this same karate chop on Super Saiyan God Goku, but it failed to work! This shows us that Goku’s power has increased to astounding new heights!\n\nIt was one of those blink-and-you-miss moments during the beginning of their battle.\n\nIn the end, 70% Beerus was able to defeat 80% Super Saiyan God Goku; remember that Goku never fought at 100% with his new power.\n\nSaiyan beyond God is a “form” that Goku and Vegeta reach after the events of Battle of Gods, and during their time as students under Whis.\n\nA Saiyan prodigy who transforms into Super Saiyan God will revert back to base form after the Super Saiyan God form time limit runs out. However, they will absorb the power of the Super Saiyan God into their base form. This will result in the Saiyan becoming a Saiyan beyond God.\n\nIt reminds me of Ultimate Gohan because in his “base form” he has far more power than he ever did as a Super Saiyan 1 or 2. The reason I say “base form” is because as Ultimate Gohan his outer appearance barely changes from his regular appearance.\n\nWhen it comes to Saiyan beyond God vs. the appearance of base Goku or Vegeta, the only change is the color of their aura. It becomes more of a milky white color when compared to their standard base form aura.\n\nWhen a Saiyan beyond God has access to the Super Saiyan transformation…they can become a Super Saiyan God Super Saiyan!\n\nIt is unknown how much more powerful this makes a Saiyan beyond God, or how much more powerful this form is when compared to a Super Saiyan God.\n\nMost fans are quick to assume that just like the standard Super Saiyan transformation; it increases a Saiyan’s power 50 times over the power of his base power. In this case, “base power” is considered Saiyan beyond God.\n\nWait, does that mean a Super Saiyan God Super Saiyan is 50 times the power of a Super Saiyan God?\n\nSaiyan beyond God is basically a Saiyan in base form that has mastered or absorbed the power of a Super Saiyan God into their body right?\n\nAlthough it is not official, I can see why most fans would assume that Super Saiyan God Super Saiyan is superior to a Super Saiyan God by 50 times.\n\nHowever, the Super Saiyan multiplier scale seems to conflict with Akira Toriyama’s own power scale for the gods.\n\nHe stated his own personal belief on the power differences between the Battle of Gods characters below:\n\nSuper Saiyan God Goku is about a “6”, Beerus a “10” and Whis about a “15”.\n\nTo me this never made much sense, and please do not think that I am debating the word of the official creator of Dragon Ball Z. However, the key phrase here is that these levels are Akira’s “own personal belief.”\n\nWith that being said, I think it is fair for me (or any other fan for that matter) to have my own personal belief as well.\n\nAs I mentioned before, Beerus was only fighting at 70% power when he battled Super Saiyan God Goku. The Saiyan never truly fought at 100% with his new godly power. His time limit in the form ran out before he could kick things up to full power.\n\nTrue, Beerus mentioned that Goku absorbed the power of the Super Saiyan God into his base form, and from there transformed into a Super Saiyan. That explained why he was able to fight on par with Beerus for some time, and he did not even notice that his Super Saiyan God fuel had burned out until Beerus mentioned it to him.\n\nSome may argue that Goku fought Beerus as a Saiyan beyond God after his Super Saiyan God power fizzled out like a flat can of soda.\n\nOthers might mention that Goku fighting Beerus as a Full Power Super Saiyan with the power of a Super Saiyan God was a potential foreshadowing of the Super Saiyan God Super Saiyan!\n\nBoth are valid points, and I think they are worth mentioning.\n\nNow here is where my opinion is slightly different than Akira’s own personal belief. If my math is mistaken, please feel free to let me know in the comment section below (and be respectful because we are all human, and mistakes can be made).\n\nIf Beerus (at 70% power) was fighting Super Saiyan God Goku (at 80% power), wouldn’t this imply that Beerus is at best only 10% more powerful than Super Saiyan God Goku?\n\nThat conflicts with Goku being a 6, and Beerus being a 10. The gap of 4 seems to imply much more than a 10% difference in strength. My opinion is that Akira did not write Battle of Gods with the intention of having an exact measuring system of power levels.\n\nRemember that they were only introduced into the series so the characters and fans would come to realize how useless they really were.\n\nConsidering that Trunks at level 5 was the last power level scanned in the series, I am sure that we can assume that in the interview, Akira did not have an exact figure in his head regarding the power of the gods. We just know that Whis is more powerful than Beerus, and Beerus is more powerful than Goku.\n\nTo me, Full Power Super Saiyan Goku (with the power of Super Saiyan God) was not as powerful as he was when he was a Super Saiyan God. I say this because Goku was experiencing the power for the very first time, and he did not have full mastery over his new power yet.\n\nAfter training with Whis, I suspect the Saiyan beyond God version of Goku is superior to even his Super Saiyan God form from Battle of Gods (to a certain extent).\n\nWe then find out that the Super Saiyan God Super Saiyan is basically a Super Saiyan fighting with the power of a Super Saiyan God.\n\nWait, does that mean Goku could become a Super Saiyan God Super Saiyan 2 and a Super Saiyan God Super Saiyan 3?\n\nI am not going to go down that rabbit hole because we could be going back and forth about this for an eternity. If Goku could indeed reach those forms then as a Super Saiyan God Super Saiyan 3, his power would be 400 times the power of a Saiyan beyond God!\n\nNow to get back on track, Saiyan beyond God is superior to Super Saiyan God in the sense that this is a base form Saiyan that has mastered the Super Saiyan God transformation.\n\nWhat does this mean?\n\nIt means that base form Goku and Vegeta can fight with the power of a Super Saiyan God, but the time limit of the godly form is no longer a handicap.\n\nAgain a comparison can be made to Ultimate Gohan vs. Super Saiyan 3. Gohan is allowed to fight with his maximum power without his Ki supply being quickly drained like a Super Saiyan 3.\n\nSuper Saiyan God Super Saiyan is the next stage of a superior Super Saiyan God because it also allows a Saiyan to fight with the power of the Super Saiyan God, but without any sort of time limit handicap.\n\nI know we have covered a lot of ground so far, but let’s do a quick recap just to be sure we are on the same page.\n\nSaiyan beyond God is the base form of a Saiyan that has now mastered and retained the power of a Super Saiyan God. Any Saiyan that is capable of becoming a Super Saiyan can take their Saiyan beyond God stage to the level of a Super Saiyan God Super Saiyan.\n\nBoth of these incarnations of a Saiyan can be considered superior in power to the Super Saiyan God transformation.\n\nMoving onto GT, although it was never officially stated; Goku in base form is said to be as powerful as he was at the Super Saiyan 3 level in DBZ (specifically in the Buu Saga, not the 10 year gap between the death of Kid Buu and the departure of Goku with Uub).\n\nThis made me cringe as a child when I heard this because I was difficult to believe that Kid Goku (GT) was on par with the Super Saiyan 3 that we had seen fighting with Kid Buu!\n\nHowever, most fans associate Goku’s power to Super Saiyan 3 because of his statement to General Rilldo about the Machine Mutant being more powerful than even Majin Buu.\n\nGoku actually fights on par (and even has the upper hand for a good portion of the fight) with Rilldo, and that is why most fans say he was at the power of a Buu Saga Super Saiyan 3 Goku. It is also worth mentioning that this is in reference to Rilldo’s first form, and not his other 2 transformation that make Goku power up to Super Saiyan 1 which makes him 50 times more powerful than before.\n\nThings can get extremely complicated when thinking about a base form Goku being on par with his Super Saiyan 3 form from DBZ.\n\nThink of it this way:\n\nKid Goku (GT) in base form = Super Saiyan 3 Goku from Buu Saga.\n\nThis would mean GT Goku is 400 times the power of base power Goku from the Buu Saga!\n\nWhat does this mean in terms of the Super Saiyan multipliers when applied to GT Goku?\n\nSuper Saiyan 1 is 50 times base power\n\nSuper Saiyan 2 is twice the power of Super Saiyan 1\n\nSuper Saiyan 3 is four times the power of Super Saiyan 2\n\nSuper Saiyan 4 is ten times the power of Super Saiyan 3\n\nMeaning that Super Saiyan 4 Goku in GT is 4,000 times the power of Super Saiyan 3 Goku from the Buu Saga!\n\nYes, I find this mind blowing as well because it all goes back to what Vegeta from the Team Four Star Abridged series of DBZ said about power levels:\n\nAlright, at this point the question arises as to which form of Goku would come out on top if Super Saiyan God Super Saiyan met Super Saiyan 4.\n\nI am willing to bet that in terms of power alone…the winner would be Super Saiyan 4.\n\nHear me out on this:\n\nWe know that Super Saiyan God is more powerful than Super Saiyan 3, but we do not know by how much. Super Saiyan God Super Saiyan is speculated (and keep in mind that it is not official) to be 50 times the power of a Saiyan beyond God, and this “form” is literally a base form Saiyan with the power of a Super Saiyan God.\n\nFans speculate Super Saiyan God Super Saiyan to be 50 times the power of a Super Saiyan God.\n\nThe reason I feel that Super Saiyan 4 Goku is more powerful is simply because a base form Goku that is equal in power to a Buu Saga Super Saiyan 3 Goku is just insane to think about because he gets a 4,000 times power increase at Super Saiyan 4.\n\nI will say that we do know Saiyan beyond God Goku is more powerful than GT base form Goku.\n\nWhy?\n\nIt has been said many times that Saiyan beyond Goku is basically Super Saiyan God Goku (just without the drastic change in appearance), and that would mean his power is much higher than Super Saiyan 3 Goku!\n\nHowever, if Super Saiyan God Super Saiyan is indeed only 50 times the power of Saiyan beyond God (or Super Saiyan God), I feel that it goes without saying that a 50-fold power increase would not be able to matchup to a Super Saiyan 4 GT Goku.\n\nSuper Saiyan GT Goku alone is already 50 times the power of Super Saiyan 3 DBZ Goku, which increases to 100 times as a Super Saiyan 2, and 400 times as a Super Saiyan 3…\n\nI do not think that Super Saiyan God is that much of a power-up when compared to Super Saiyan 3.\n\nIf Goku were to fully master his training under Whis in order to become a perfect warrior, he would have an advantage over Super Saiyan 4 Goku.\n\nRemember that Whis pointed out Goku’s main flaw as being too relaxed in battle, and that leaves him open to attack. This can lead to his defeat by a weaker opponent, and we saw this happen when Sorbet blasted him through the heart with his ring laser!\n\nCan you imagine a Goku that was flawless in combat? True, Super Saiyan 4 is more powerful, but that version of Goku would not have the training of Whis to back him up!\n\nI am keeping “GT Goku” and “Battle of Gods Goku” as separate entities during this fight.\n\nSome fans are probably reading this and would consider the fight to be over in a matter of seconds! I mean Super Saiyan God Super Saiyan Goku would just need to cut off Super Saiyan 4 Goku’s tail!\n\nYes, I know that would be a way of ending the fight very quickly. However, who would want to see that as the ending of such an epic battle?\n\nI know that I would not want this battle between Super Saiyans to be over before it begun due to Super Saiyan 4 Goku’s main handicap.\n\nSomething else that needs to be taken into consideration is that Super Saiyan 4 and Super Saiyan God/Super Saiyan God Super Saiyan are completely different levels. I mean Super Saiyan 4 seems to fit into the same spectrum as the first 3 Super Saiyan levels.\n\nHowever, Super Saiyan God is in a league of its own. It is a being of such divine energy and power that it cannot be sensed by “lesser beings” through the use of a Ki signature. I do not think that this means Super Saiyan God is automatically more powerful than Super Saiyan 4 (because in GT, it is mentioned on more than one occasion by other characters that Goku’s Ki is incredible in the form; meaning “lesser beings” "
