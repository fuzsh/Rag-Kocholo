I found a list of the top 54 closest exoplanets and added their total distance to Earth (got slightly over 1000 light years), then divided by 3 years converted to seconds. Ended up with 300x FTL. Could potentially be MFTL+ since that was only 54 planets wheras Kid Buu destroyed at least 200.\n\nLightbuster30 said:\n\nYeah I know, but I read Bibidi had teleportation (unless that was Anime only)\n\nBut it's definitely MFTL (without the +).

Him being Bibidi's son was retconned.\n\nBibidi can teleport. He teleports the spaceship and everyone in them.\n\nDon't know anything about calcs. All I can say is this:\n\nCreate a blog page with all calculations made and give your evidence for the upgrade.\n\nThen, message knowledgeable DB members and Calc group memebers to give their input on your calcs in order for upgrade.\n\nYeah but where did teleportation for Bibidi come from?\n\nHe learned it as soon as he saw Shin do it so why wouldn't he do it beforehand? Not to mention: if he knew teleportation, why would he take at least years to annihilate hundreds of planets? It doesn't seem plausible for so little planets to be destroyed with that much time with that kind of ability.\n\nLightbuster30 said:\n\nYeah but where did teleportation for Bibidi come from?\n\nHe learned it as soon as he saw Shin do it so why wouldn't he do it beforehand?

I meant Babidi about teleporting the spaceship, Goku, and Co..\n\nBibidi could have teleported Kid Buu to the Kioshin realm and absorbed South Kai and Daikioshin.\n\nBoth canon to the manga.\n\nBecause we don't have anything about him doing teleportation in the manga. Just that moment when he copy it from Kibitoshin."
