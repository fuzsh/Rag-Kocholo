        "text": "What kind of reality warping are we talking about?\n\nNot sure mindfuck would really wok against Majin Buu. Doesn't seem like a prime candidate to have his thoughts played around with.\n\nTransmutation should work provided Discord is more powerful than Majin Buu.\n\nIf we use composite or anime Buu low solar system level probably won't be enough to stop his regen. If we use manga Buu, he gets blitzed and turned into whatever Discord wants.\n\nTo destroy an entire galaxy in that short amount of time, I don't know the number you would need for it. But he's literally wiping out a galaxy over a short course of time. Low Solar System would not cut it.\n\nAlright. So if the candy beam wouldn't work what if anime buu forces himself down Discord's throat and tries to tear him up from the inside like he attempted to do with Vegito? Or uses that position (since Discord would have to hurt himself to try to get buu out) to more easily absorb Discord?\n\nUm Discord can casually pull his own body apart with no ill-effect whatsoever. He splits his own head in half to avoid an attack at one point. Also I forgot to mention he has telekinesis when I was listing his powers, he could grab Buu before he'd get close. Hell if Buu did get inside him, he can just warp Buu back out. Buu isn't out-haxxing Discord here.\n\nWhat kind of reality warping are we talking about?\n\nNot sure mindfuck would really wok against Majin Buu.

If we use manga Buu, he gets blitzed and turned into whatever Discord wants.\n\nAdmittedly not very much, just simple stuff like warping landscapes and screwing with gravity.\n\nWouldn't Buu's simple-minded nature make him more susceptible to mindfuck than anything. Otherwise how did Bibidi keep Kid Buu from killing him the way Fat Buu did to Babidi.\n\nHe is, more powerful than manga Buu anyway.\n\nUm Discord can casually pull his own body apart with no ill-effect whatsoever. He splits his own head in half to avoid an attack at one point.\n\nBuu would be able to stick to his insides though. He could also probably change his consistency to smoke to be even harder to remove.\n\nAlso I forgot to mention he has telekinesis when I was listing his powers, he could grab Buu before he'd get close.\n\nKid Buu has instantaneous movement from Kibito Kai. So he could teleport out of that telekinetic grab.\n\nHell if Buu did get inside him, he can just warp Buu back out. Buu isn't out-haxxing Discord here.\n\nAnd Buu can just warp back in with IM. Or he could envelop Discord while he's trying to remove him to absorb him.\n\nBuu would be able to stick to his insides though.

Smoke can still cling to glass i'd think.\n\nHim splitting his body apart\n\nI don't see how that would stop Buu from sticking to him.\n\nIf Buu does manage to absorb him it would probably knock him unconscious through some magical means as Super Buu was to absorb Gohan who was stronger than him. From there even if Discord woke up inside Buu, Buu could go inside himself and fight using Discord's own powers against him.\n\nThat and there's still the option of mindfucking Buu.\n\nAnime Buu should have pretty good mental defenses actually. Just his mental projections/memories of Gotenks, Gohan, and Piccolo were strong enough to take on Goku and Vegeta. If someone tried to fuck with his mind he'd probably just go inside himself and more deeply control his own mind to counter it.\n\nHe threatened to seal him away because he knew the incantation. It kept Buu in in line. He never had Buu under control like he had Dabra under control.\n\nWhat kind of mindfuck are we talking about? Buu's already insane.\n\nI meant Bibidi keeping Kid Buu under control when he first created him, you know, the Buu that has no rational thinking ability whatsoever and is just a relentless killing machine. Bibidi would have been dead instantly if he couldn't control him. Babidi was working with a much more intelligent version of Buu (meaning he could understand the threat to seal him back up) who would be harder to mindfuck as a result.\n\nAs for what Discord could do. He could simply make him leave and win by forfeit, simple as that.\n\nI meant Bibidi keeping Kid Buu under control when he first created him, you know, the Buu that has no rational thinking ability whatsoever and is just a relentless killing machine.

He's existed since time immemorial and Bibidi just summoned him.\n\nBibidi also never exhibited control over buu. In the anime flashback we see Kid Buu actively tries to kill Bibidi and when he teleports to dodge the attack Buu just gets bored and decides to kill the supreme kais instead.\n\nSo he can turn into glass?

If someone tried to fuck with his mind he'd probably just go inside himself and more deeply control his own mind to counter it.\n\nHe didn't turn into the glass, he went inside it. Buu trying to grab the glass wouldn't accomplish a thing.\n\nBecause Discord will dodge anything he tries (to absorb him anyway). You seem to be under this misconception Discord will let Buu hit him, which he wont even IC. He has an answer for everything Buu can try. Buu turns to smoke, Discord grabs him with telekinesis and/or vacuums him up (this is definitely something he would do now that I think about it lol). Buu teleports, Discord responds in kind. Even assuming he catches him, Discord can just teleport away.Discord dimension dumps him, Buu breaks out or teleports back The only way Buu can win is anime Buu having the dc to kill him outright, his hax isn't helping.\n\nThat was Super Buu though (after absorbing all those people), Kid Buu lacks the ability to even think rationally (and the absorbed indiduals to draw memories from) so I very much doubt that would scale to him even if he is the strongest in the anime. Nonetheless it doesn't matter, anime Buu forces a stalemate or wins outright.\n\nI meant Bibidi keeping Kid Buu under control when he first created him, you know, the Buu that has no rational thinking ability whatsoever and is just a relentless killing machine.

He could simply make him leave and win by forfeit, simple as that.\n\nAs xeno pointed, Bibidi merely found out how to awaken and seal Buu. He didn't create him.\n\nAs for controlling Kid Buu not sure how that would work. Babidi has some decent psychic abilities but they weren't enough to control any version of Majin Buu."
