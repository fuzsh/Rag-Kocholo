        "text": "Cradle (Aug. 25, 2018) #1 Share Copy\n\nQuestioner\n\nWhere do you go for the best food in Cradle?\n\nWill Wight\n\nIn many places in Cradle, it's difficult to tell, but everything in the Blackflame Empire is ranked for your convenience.The #1 rated restaurant in the Empire is the Dragon's Breath, a grill that specializes in unbelievably exotic meats. There, you can taste spiced sea dragon, butter-roasted Cloud Eagle, slices of butter-soft sashimi from tuna longer than a man is tall, and thousand-year peach wine.It's appropriately expensive. Many of the customers bring in the creatures their families have captured and pay to have them prepared by the high-class artisans on staff.\n\nCradle (Aug. 25, 2018) #2 Share Copy\n\nQuestioner\n\nWhat's the biggest chain restaurant in cradle? Such as McDonalds.\n\nWill Wight\n\nSungarden restaurants are all over a different continent. They have life artists that can grow tailor-made fruits and vegetables on command, so you're ordering from a menu of genetic options as much as a selection of dishes.\n\nCradle (Aug. 25, 2018) #3 Share Copy\n\nQuestioner\n\nWhat is the most pleasant and painless iron body type to develop?\n\nWill Wight\n\nThe Drifting Iron Body. It involves undergoing a process to weaken gravity's hold on the body, making you lighter. The actual transformation process involves being woven into a silken cocoon made by refiners from plants that grow among the clouds. It feels like being suspended among hundreds of pillows for several hours a day over many weeks.\n\nCradle (Aug. 25, 2018) #4 Share Copy\n\nQuestioner\n\nScrew Lindons wolverine body. The Drifting Iron body is the one for me. I imagine its for people whom want to fly ,glide, float or be a parkour ninja.\n\nWill Wight\n\nThere's a similar Iron body for a Path that has rigid metallic wings as their Goldsign. They're not a wind Path, so it's difficult for them to fly, but if their bodies are light enough they can glide.This particular Iron body is from a sect of body-enhancing life artists that you might call ninjas.\n\nCradle (Aug. 25, 2018) #5 Share Copy\n\nQuestioner\n\nIf the most pleasant iron body is asked, then what's with the most painful, except for Lindon's(if his IS even the most painful one)\n\nWill Wight\n\nIt's hard to quantify the MOST painful Iron Body; is burning alive more painful than being torn apart piece by piece?Because those are both actual ways of developing an Iron body.There are some Iron bodies similar to Lindon's that involve being stabbed and cut over and over while you're being healed. There are others that involve adapting your body to fire, which basically means burning yourself one part at a time.\n\nCradle (Aug. 25, 2018) #6 Share Copy\n\nQuestioner\n\nWhat's the most advanced piece of technology native to Cradle?\n\nWill Wight\n\nThere are cloudships far more advanced than the one the Arelius family use, and they have powerful onboard weaponry as well as long-range communications and detection.However, it's difficult to develop technology that works reliably everywhere in Cradle. Gunpowder might explode with too much force in an area where fire aura is strong, or destruction aura might cause an engine to burn too much fuel. There are patches of aura that block certain detection methods, and beings whose very existence can cloud a sacred artist's spiritual senses.\n\nCradle (Aug. 25, 2018) #7 Share Copy\n\nQuestioner\n\nCradle: Are there paths that grant tremendous power swiftly at the cost of later advancement?\n\nWill Wight\n\nThe most common Paths for those who want to gain quick power at any cost are blood/sword Paths. It's a common pairing, because a battlefield typically has both strong sword aura and strong blood aura.The aura is powerful, as well as easy to create and cycle: you just have to keep killing people. The stronger the physical body, the greater the power of the blood aura. Virtually everyone who walks a Path of slaughter and bloodshed reaches Truegold quickly.The problem comes after that.First of all, you've killed a lot of people, so you've made enemies. They won't let you get away with enjoying the spoils of your evil Path.Second, even if you manage to slip away, there's no hiding that the power of your soul is drenched in blood. There are blood arts focused on healing, and others focused on strengthening the body, but it's easy to sense the difference between those and powers gained through murder. Peaceful civilizations won't accept you, and there are even laws in many places banning \"evil arts,\" \"slaughter arts,\" \"demonic arts,\" etc.Therefore, because interaction with other people is difficult, it becomes harder to obtain the backing you need for the resources to cross into Underlord and above. As every further stage requires more and more resources, eventually you'll find yourself stranded and surrounded by enemies. That, or killed in combat.But it's not as though no one has ever succeeded in advancing along this Path...\n\nCradle (Aug. 25, 2018) #8 Share Copy\n\nQuestioner\n\nAre there any instances of sacred artists \"selling themselves \" into slavery at a coliseum to gain patrons and have a legal way to cultivate blood madra?\n\nWill Wight\n\nMost culturally acceptable blood Paths are medical, so it's not difficult to find sources of blood aura. Also, every living being generates some blood aura, so you can cycle a little wherever you are.\n\nCradle (Aug. 25, 2018) #9 Share Copy\n\nQuestioner\n\nAre there any paths that follow the same line of rules like common monsters in our world? Werewolves, vampires, that kind of thing.\n\nWill Wight\n\nThere are some blood Paths that involve advancing by drinking blood, or elixirs made from blood, yes.And there are a few different types of what you might call werewolves. Some sacred wolves are somewhat humanoid, and there are other Paths that transform into bestial forms in order to fight.\n\nCradle (Aug. 25, 2018) #10 Share Copy\n\nQuestioner\n\nHow did the other empires of Cradle consider the Blackflames when they were at their strongest? And how would they react to a new Blackflame?\n\nWill Wight\n\n\"How would they react to a new Blackflame?\" is a bit too much of a spoiler, but...When the Blackflame Empire was at its height, it controlled the whole (massive) continent. That was when it was ruled by dragons.When the Blackflame family was at the height of their power, their empire controlled about half the continent. As for the other half...well, the dragons and their descendants had to go somewhere.Now that the Blackflame lineage has fallen, the Empire is even smaller. About a third of the continent. The dragons outside are powerful enough to wipe out the human empire, except that the humans of the Blackflame Empire have a backer.To the other great nations around the world, including the Ninecloud Court, the original Blackflame Empire was a real power. Now, it's just one territory sheltered under the wing of a true powerhouse.\n\nCradle (Aug. 25, 2018) #11 Share Copy\n\nQuestioner\n\nHow are shooting stars explained in Cradle?\n\nWill Wight\n\nOne culture explains them this way:The night sky is our glimpse into the heavens. When we see a shooting star, we're seeing a heavenly messenger descending to someone in the world.\n\nCradle (Aug. 25, 2018) #12 Share Copy\n\nQuestioner\n\nPure Madra as a building material in the emperor's palace?\n\nWill Wight\n\nPure madra is an unreliable building material. It breaks easily, and it's so impressionable that placing it next to any other Forged madra will cause the two types to mix, changing both of their properties. However, it is used decoratively. Sometimes it is used to substitute for stained glass; you Forge a pane of pure madra and then stain it in spots with madra of different colors and properties. The other madra spreads like paint through the glass, creating a moving, swirling, blending canvas of living power. You just have to be careful about how long you let it sit and how much power you put into it, or it might randomly create a powerful effect.\n\nCradle (Aug. 25, 2018) #13 Share Copy\n\nQuestioner\n\nWould it absorb madra launched at it? A forged pane of pure madra would be very cool for Lindon to learn how to do if it could be used as a defense.\n\nWill Wight\n\nUnfortunately, it doesn't work that way. Technically it would intercept any madra thrown at it, but most of the time it would just shatter. Sometimes it would actually make the technique MORE powerful for having passed through and absorbed the pure madra.There could be ways to fashion it into a defense, but they're almost all hugely impractical. It would be much easier to just have a regular wall and carve a script into it.\n\nCradle (Aug. 25, 2018) #14 Share Copy\n\nQuestioner\n\nIs there a ranking system by the Abidan to measure the world level of advancement? Could u give us the rating for your currently displayed worlds if yes?\n\nWill Wight\n\nYes, the Abidan do have such a system, and sufficiently advanced worlds are allowed to interact with the Abidan openly. Though most Iterations never make it to this point.I can't share it with you, though, because I haven't perfected it yet. I have an early version of the system, but I don't like it much, and it's likely to change before it makes an appearance in the books.\n\nCradle (Aug. 25, 2018) #15 Share Copy\n\nQuestioner\n\nAre there other colors of dragon madra beyond \"black\"flame?\n\nWill Wight\n\nThe dragons who inhabited the lands of the Blackflame empire were (and are) black, the color of the destructive aura that they cycled. There are sea dragons that are blue, sky dragons with a variety of colors, and earthbound land dragons that might be green or brown.But you asked about the color of their flame, not the color of their scales. Yes, there are dragons with toxic green flame, frigid icy \"flame\" that consumes even as it freezes, good old natural flame, and red living flames that drift around like Remnants burning as much as possible to extend their fleeting lives.\n\nCradle (Aug. 25, 2018) #16 Share Copy\n\nQuestioner\n\nSo could Lindon learn all the dragon paths?(If he split his core some more of course.) And does this mean that technically he could learn other beasts paths? If he absorbed the remnant of the sacred beast that was in the arelius bloodline would he get their bloodline powers?\n\nWill Wight\n\nThere is a way for someone born without bloodline powers to acquire them. But in order for him to get the Arelius powers, he'd have to find the same sacred beast they got their powers from. Or another of a similar type.\n\nCradle (Aug. 25, 2018) #17 Share Copy\n\nQuestioner\n\nWhich sacred beast produces the best bristle material for the Aurelias Clans brooms?\n\nWill Wight\n\nThere's a species of eagle whose tail-feathers have a unique relationship with wind aura. When you sweep such a feathered broom, the wind actually gathers up all the dust and loose debris in a small area and piles it neatly up. Scholars believe that the patterns in the feathers act as a script to produce such a unique effect, but no one really knows for sure. In battle, the Broom Sage used bristles from the tail of the Thorn Mountain Boar, a fifteen-story-tall boar that ate forests. The wood for his broom was taken from a branch of the Underworld Herald, a self-aware ancestral tree that once grew upside-down in an underground kingdom of blood and darkness.\n\nCradle (Aug. 25, 2018) #18 Share Copy\n\nQuestioner\n\nWhat path is the best later on in the stages but sucks early in your advancement?\n\nWill Wight\n\nPath of the Starseed.\n\nPractitioners gather aura of light and heat into a tiny ball of madra that they keep inside their spirits. They can manifest it, like a tiny star in their hands, but any power they use is taken away from the Starseed's growth.\n\nAs they advance, they also advance their Starseed, but it's far less useful than any similar Paths (like, say, Heaven's Glory) until they reach Underlord. Once the Starseed is bathed and forged in soulfire, it becomes another level of existence entirely.Now practitioners can use their Starseed to melt through stone, and as it gets larger and more dense, the sacred artists become deadlier. If they continue to advance, their Starseeds can eventually burn cities in seconds after manifesting.\n\nCradle (Aug. 25, 2018) #19 Share Copy\n\nQuestioner\n\nI assume the artists on the Path of the Starseed have some way of protecting their body from the aura? Also, can they only manifest it inside their hands, or within a certain distance?\n\nWill Wight\n\nIt's cupped a few inches from their hands, like a ball. As they advance, they can control it more freely and project it farther.\n\nCradle (Aug. 25, 2018) #20 Share Copy\n\nQuestioner\n\nAre scripts some form of universal language or just Cradle oriented? Are there similar things in Amalgam or Asylum?\n\nWill Wight\n\nScripting is unique to Cradle, but other worlds have similar systems for guiding, shaping, or controlling their native energy.\n\nCradle (Aug. 25, 2018) #21 Share Copy\n\nQuestioner\n\nAre there legendary remnants that are especially sought after? Also, are there any effects (good oreasonbad) that come from bonding a remnant that is insanely far beyond your cultivation level?\n\nWill Wight\n\nThere are indeed some ancient or legendary Remnants, at least one of which will be shown in Skysworn. As far as bonding a Remnant beyond your advancement, it's a big risk. The Remnant has more of a sense of identity, so it can make your bonding process either much easier or much harder. Yerin could never have bonded the Sword Sage's Remnant, for instance, if he hadn't allowed it.\n\nCradle (Aug. 25, 2018) #22 Share Copy\n\nQuestioner\n\nWere the sacred artists Suriel revealed to Lindon a mere sampling of the beings at that power level, or are these literally the only three groups at their level?\n\nWill Wight\n\nThey are not the only ones. In the form of a young boy, an ancient dragon rules the desert to the east of the Blackflame Empire. He is kept from consuming the humans by the deterrent of the Akura clan, whose Matriarch is one of the few beings on the planet he respects. Northstrider gathers power in the hopes that he will one day be able to challenge this particular dragon.\n\nCradle (Aug. 25, 2018) #23 Share Copy\n\nQuestioner\n\nDoes Cradle have a community equivalent to video game theorycrafters, who spend all day working out min/maxed combos of ironbody/cycle method/madra paths?\n\nWill Wight\n\nThere is such an organization, and I'd love to go into detail about them, but unfortunately I'm afraid it might be a spoiler.But the non-story answer is yes!\n\nCradle (Aug. 25, 2018) #24 Share Copy\n\nQuestioner\n\nAre there any places on cradle where information on sacred art techniques are widely available and indigenous practitioners are encouraged to develop their own paths?\n\nWill Wight\n\nThe Dawnspring Archive.It's both a location and an organization dedicated to helping young sacred artists develop their own, personal Path. They have dream tablets from all over the world and from all sorts of Paths, which can encourage children to expand their imaginations and experiences with the sacred arts.\n\nCradle (Aug. 25, 2018) #25 Share Copy\n\nQuestioner\n\nAre there any paths that are agriculturally focused?\n\nWill Wight\n\nThe Redflower family actually uses several Paths in conjunction in order to keep the Empire fed.The Path of the Yellow Flower involves moving earth and nurturing soil. The Path of the Green Flower encourages growth and the health of crops. The Path of the Blue Flower gathers water from the air and facilitates irrigation. The Path of the White Flower controls air flow and climate regulation.The Path of the Red Flower, for which the family was named, was designed to defend the others.\n\nCradle (Aug. 25, 2018) #26 Share Copy\n\nQuestioner\n\nWhat would be a popular tale/story/folklore that people would tell their children to scare them in the world of cradle?\n\nWill Wight\n\nThe Lonely Wolf.Once, there was a wolf pup born as the smallest in his litter. He wanted nothing more than to be close to his brothers and sisters, but they would shove him out of the den every night, where he would shiver alone in the cold. Every morning, he would try to get close to them again, but every night he was pushed out of the cave once more.So it was that when a tiger walked into the den and devoured the whole pack, he missed the lonely wolf pup.The lonely wolf survived, but he was even lonelier than ever. He tried to join another pack, but they too rejected him. He tried to join a flock of birds, but they flew away. Schools of fish fled when he approached the river.He wandered through life alone, and the years passed. Then the decades. Then the centuries.The lonely wolf had become more than a simple beast. The shadows responded to his desire to get close to others, and now they hid him. At last, hidden in the shadows, he could slip into other packs and pretend to be one of them. None of the wolves, not even other sacred wolves, ever saw more than a flickering shadow.But in a way, he was lonelier than ever. Now he could stay close, but not close enough. No one could see him, nor treat him as part of their family. He was nothing but a ghost, drifting through the lives of others.The loneliness grew until it became an ache, then a pain. Then a hunger.And he thought of one way to be closer to his fellow wolves.The first time he swallowed a wolf pup, he finally felt that burden on his soul lighten. Now that there was another wolf inside his skin, his loneliness was relieved. But only briefly.When his stomach was empty again, he swallowed another wolf. Then another. He worked his way up the pack until he was alone again.Then he found a village.Like a creeping shadow, the lonely wolf moved through the homes, looking for someone to join him inside his body. He started with the infants, and when they had all joined him, he moved his way up to the little children. Only when the entire village was with him did he move on to the next village.So at night, as the firelight flickers, keep watching those patches of shifting shadows at the corner of your eye. It might be the lonely wolf, just looking for another friend.\n\nCradle (Aug. 25, 2018) #27 Share Copy\n\nQuestioner\n\nWhat is a powerful elixir with a huge drawback\n\nWill Wight\n\nA Dragon's Tear. It's refined from two perfectly balanced varieties of madra (the actual ingredients used depend on the refiner's Path and the availability in the region). When you swallow it, it releases an explosion of power that \"supercharges\" your soul, so to speak, releasing enormous power temporarily. However, it strains the madra channels, which can lead to permanent spiritual damage. In a severe case, it could leave you with no more power than an Unsouled. More importantly, it's addictive. Not chemically, but even users with no spiritual damage report feeling that their souls feel weaker afterwards in comparison to that brief moment of transcendent power.\n\nCradle (Aug. 25, 2018) #28 Share Copy\n\nQuestioner\n\nWhat book/novel in the world of Cradle is poularly considered a must read amongst Crade inhabitants and why? Lastly, what does it retail at?\n\nWill Wight\n\nChildren of Eternity is a popular novel about a romance between an immortal man and woman in their never-ending quest to stay together, but the world keeps tearing them apart.\n\nIt's fairly cheap in the Blackflame Empire, at sixteen low-grade scales per copy. But of course, the scales of some Paths are worth more than others.\n\nCradle (Aug. 25, 2018) #29 Share Copy\n\nQuestioner\n\nIf I wanted to be the greatest travelling musician in the Blackflame empire, what Path should I be following to make this happen?\n\nWill Wight\n\nIf you wanted to be the greatest musician in Cradle, you would have a rival. She is known as Nightsong, though the legends generally agree that she was not born with this name.\n\nShe follows the Path of the Moonlit Flute, and her powers vary according to the storyteller. Some say that she played a song over a battle between two Sages who had hated one another for years, and they walked away friends. Only weeks later, the two were married.\n\nIt is said she rides a Remnant, but never the same one. She simply plays a song on her flute, and Remnants compete to carry her around.\n\nCradle (Aug. 25, 2018) #30 Share Copy\n\nQuestioner\n\nWill, How many peopel have reached the same stage Northstrider has on Cradle. Currently we only know of 3, or is it 10?\n\nDepends on whether all members of 8-Man Empires have reached the same rank, or if the woman Suriel singled out, who managed to get to Low-Gold when she was only 6 years old, exceeds the rank of her friends.\n\nWill Wight\n\nHm. I don't think I can answer this with a worldbuilding story.\n\nTherefore, I will sidestep with a story that sort of answers your question:\n\nReigan Shen is the creator and sole practitioner of the Path of the King's Key. Centuries ago, he consulted an oracle and grew to believe that he was destined to rule the world. He seeks to make that vision a reality.\n\nHe fought the Eight-Man Empire to a standstill, though they eventually drove him off. He has stolen Northstrider's prey. He is considered one of the Ninecloud Court's greatest enemies, though everyone below the Queen is instructed to treat him as an honored guest, should he arrive.\n\nOnly about six years ago, he finally slew his longtime rival. Though Lindon didn't know it, he felt the aftereffects of that battle in Sacred Valley.\n\nCradle (Aug. 25, 2018) #31 Share Copy\n\nQuestioner\n\nWhat is the average life expectancy of someone on the path of gluttonous avarice?\n\nWill Wight\n\nAdarsh is right.Some of them, of course, eat anything they can get their hands on. These are almost impossible to kill, as their bodies process the power they consume to protect them. But they often die on their own, as their organs will eventually fail so badly that Enforcer techniques can't preserve them any longer.However, some of them devour only the most valuable delicacies. Ancient Remnant dead matter processed by Soulsmiths to be edible, the delicately seasoned meat of a thousand-year-old Underlord-level sacred beast, or fruits of such pure power that they glitter like crystal.These practitioners might be rail-thin and live for centuries more than their counterparts. Their bodies also tend to take on strange properties.\n\nCradle (Aug. 25, 2018) #32 Share Copy\n\nQuestioner\n\nAre there any sacred artists out there focused on conditioning their minds, not their bodies?\n\nWill Wight\n\nMadra flows through the body, so there are no Paths that don't affect the body in some way.\n\nHowever, not every sacred artist lives by his fists.\n\nThe Path of the Diamond Sky focuses on polishing the power of the mind, until its practitioners have perfect memory, utter control over their emotions, and imaginations so vivid that some of them die inside self-created dreams.\n\nCradle (Aug. 25, 2018) #33 Share Copy\n\nQuestioner\n\nHow would an underlord on the path of the white fox compare to the other underlords of the Blackflame empire?\n\nWill Wight\n\nWhen asked what Paths were the hardest for him to fight, the Underlord of the Cloud Hammer School said, \"I despise beyond anything else the cowards who hide behind shadows and illusions. Let a true sacred artist come to me under the light of the sun and do battle. From anything else, I will flee; not because I fear the power of cowards, but because my time is too valuable to burn it away.\"\n\nCradle (Aug. 25, 2018) #34 Share Copy\n\nQuestioner\n\nWhat path do professional sex workers follow? Are they in a house and ranked like the janitors?\n\nWill Wight\n\nProstitutes often follow dream Paths, because dream madra can be used to alter appearances, induce emotions, and even find potential customers. In the Blackflame Empire, they are of course ranked. Everything is ranked. The top brothel is The Court of Roses, which caters to members of the royal family and influential clan leaders. The number one courtesan in the Court of Roses is Haru Mei, a woman on the Path of Twining Vines. She cycles aura of life and dreams, in a strange combination that helps her sense what others are feeling and manipulate those sensations.\n\nCradle (Aug. 25, 2018) #35 Share Copy\n\nQuestioner\n\nIs/was the fisher geisha married?\n\nWill Wight\n\nShe was, and in fact I expect to go into slightly more detail in Skysworn.\n\nCradle (Aug. 25, 2018) #36 Share Copy\n\nQuestioner\n\nWhat would be Lindon's favorite series?\n\nWill Wight\n\nYou know, I feel like Lindon wouldn't find Cradle to be his favorite series. He'd probably be reminded of all his unpleasant memories. He would enjoy Traveler's Gate the most, I think...not for the story, but for the existence of Valinhall, which he would see as easy, guaranteed progression.\n\nCradle (Aug. 25, 2018) #37 Share Copy\n\nQuestioner\n\nWhat is the most reviled and infamous person in Cradle History?\n\nWill Wight\n\nOne of the most well-known and reviled criminals in the history of the Blackflame Empire was a man named Gan Lo Zin, who operated the most well-known Remnant factory to be taken down and exposed.So-called Remnant factories kidnap children at Copper, then strap them to scripted devices and force-feed them scales. Their madra is cycled by force through scripts and madra devices, which is often inefficient, painful, and leads to long-term spiritual damage.However, this doesn't tend to matter. Because as soon as the children reach Jade, and thus leave stable Remnants of a high enough quality, they are slaughtered. Their Remnants are sealed and captured in boxes, to be categorized and sold to large organizations with a need for great quantities of bindings, dead matter, or Remnants for Lowgold bonding.When Gan Lo Zin was exposed, it caused a public outcry. It's estimated that he was responsible for the deaths of as many as thirty thousand people.However, when captured and questioned by the Skysworn, he maintained that he was far from the only one to operate such a facility. Outside the boundaries of the Empire, and even on other continents, he claimed that many large organizations ran their own Remnant factories.They were, he said, the inevitable price of progress.\n\nCradle (Aug. 25, 2018) #38 Share Copy\n\nQuestioner\n\nAre there any paths that utilize \"space\" aura like the rabbit, bat and mole in unsouled?

If you say no to that.... what do you call the stage that this honoured one would have to be to leave Cradle\n\nWill Wight\n\nI can't answer any of this.However, the Sword Sage could have left Cradle had he wanted to. And there were still plenty of people stronger than him in the world.\n\nCradle (Aug. 25, 2018) #40 Share Copy\n\nQuestioner\n\nWhat does water turn into if left to gather madra for long enough like a stone will turn into a Titians bone.\n\nWill Wight\n\nSacred pools, which are referred to differently in different lands, are actually fairly common. Titan's bone is almost mythical, because of how long it takes stone aura to condense in rocks and how deep you have to drill to excavate it. However, sacred pools, divine springs, and so on are commonly used to refine elixirs. They are often cultivated specifically in the gardens of powerful sects.Some believe that the deep ocean has the water with the most condensed and powerful aura, but that's difficult to judge. The power of water is of course overwhelming down there, but no one is known to have filled a container with deep-ocean water and returned to the surface without contaminating the power of the sample.\n\nCradle (Aug. 25, 2018) #41 Share Copy\n\nQuestioner\n\nMany paths seem that all they need to do is hit somebody with one hit and the person dies, ex. Heavens Glory. It seemed like if somebody was hit, they die. What keeps underlords, sages, from being just one shot K.O. by a Jade or lowgold?\n\nWill Wight\n\nWithin your body, your madra holds sway. This is why non-pure madra can't be effectively used in an Empty Palm style technique, because you can't just \"inject\" your madra into someone and expect it to do anything. It's also why fire Paths don't just set the air in their opponent's lungs on fire and walk away.The reason why a Heaven's Glory Jade can't just gun down an Underlord is an expansion of this principle. If your madra is sufficiently more powerful than your opponent's, it becomes hard for their Striker techniques to even hurt your skin. Often, the madra is simply dispersed when it touches you. The same is true for Forged madra--it can be dispersed by the natural madra of a more-advanced opponent.Ruler techniques will work equally on anyone, so they're usually what you use if you have to fight a more advanced opponent. However, there are some drawbacks.First of all, not every Path has a battle-ready Ruler technique. Second, Ruler techniques often take a long time to implement; you have to gather up compatible aura in the area and then activate it in a specific manner.It's also expected that an Underlord will have more powerful Ruler techniques than a Truegold, or will sense what is happening and dodge or disrupt it.As for Enforcer techniques, they of course work fine against higher-level opponents. But usually, someone more advanced than you will also get better results out of their Enforcer techniques. ml\n\nCradle (Aug. 25, 2018) #42 Share Copy\n\nQuestioner\n\nSo, in Cradle, what are Sages exactly?\n\nWill Wight\n\nSages are Archlords who have achieved [something special] that sets them apart from their peers. There are levels above Archlord, but Sages are actually more rare than the stage immediately over Archlord. It's easier to advance than to distinguish yourself and become a Sage.\n\nCradle (Aug. 25, 2018) #43 Share Copy\n\nQuestioner\n\nMore meta, but which Path or Iron Body would you choose?\n\nWill Wight\n\nAs for which Path I'd choose, that's an interesting question. I initially thought I would go with the Path of the Cloud Hammer, because it is a force-based Path with fairly easy aura to cultivate and many broad applications. Plus, they can run on air.However, since then I've realized I'm lazy, and I would prefer a Path that required me to move less. There are summoner-style Paths that involve manipulating construct puppets, and I'd probably choose one of them.\n\nCradle (Aug. 25, 2018) #44 Share Copy\n\nQuestioner\n\n\"What are prisons like in Cradle?\n\nWill Wight\n\nOn the Iceflower Continent, far from the Blackflame Empire, there's a buried chamber chiseled into the heart of a halfsilver vein. Madra is dispersed as soon as it touches the air, and thirteen layers of script repel all aura. There are twenty cells, and no more than twenty prisoners. Imprisoned here are those who cannot be executed.\n\nCradle (Aug. 25, 2018) #45 Share Copy\n\nQuestioner\n\nAny Paths out there that relentlessly attack with little to no defense?\n\nWill Wight\n\nAs they say: face is the place.The Path of the Last Breath, mentioned in Skysworn, both drains your own life to empower your techniques and destroy the enemy and attacks relentlessly with no regard to self-protection.There's also the Path of the Storm Lance, which focuses on channeling all of its power into Striker and Forger techniques that destroy the enemy before the enemy has a chance to resist. There is no problem they won't solve with a huge explosion.\n\nCradle (Aug. 25, 2018) #46 Share Copy\n\nQuestioner\n\nWho was the last person in sacred valley to reach gold before the events of the story?\n\nWill Wight\n\nThat's a great question, but unfortunately I can't answer it accurately without getting into why the people in Sacred Valley aren't Gold anymore, which is a spoiler.I will say that one of the founders of the Heaven's Glory School was a sacred beast who achieved Gold; a golden-scaled dragon that breathed light and heat.

I'm basically inventing the least comfortable places I can imagine. However, there's an ancient library in Cradle called the Dreamway. It's filled with thousands of dream tablets that each contain endlessly changing fictional worlds. Each tablet is essentially a virtual reality experience that crafts a new story on command. I'd want to go there. I'd probably, you know, die from neglecting my basic physical needs, but that's a nicer way to go than by visiting Valinhall.\n\nCradle (Aug. 25, 2018) #48 Share Copy\n\nQuestioner\n\nHow would the Abidan deal with a sci-fi Iteration with millions of worlds?\n\nWill Wight\n\nWhen Suriel personally intervened in Harrow, it was because the Abidan were not prepared for Harrow to be infected with corruption at all. She decided to save as many people as she could. Limit was the world that was scheduled for demolition, its population evacuated and quarantine implemented. But Ozriel didn't show up to destroy it. The corruption spread until the Abidan weren't prepared to contain it, and that's when it spread through the Way into Harrow. So: if they were prepared to save a sci-fi world with a galactic empire, they absolutely could. It would be easier and far more organized than what Suriel did in Harrow. That said, civilizations with trillions of inhabitants and multiple inhabited planets are tethered very tightly to the Way. They're very stable and difficult to corrupt naturally, so they tend to be safer.\n\nCradle (Aug. 25, 2018) #49 Share Copy\n\nQuestioner\n\nIs there a limit to how many times a core can be split?\n\nWill Wight\n\nTechnically no, but it isn't terribly efficient. You lose a little energy in the split: if your core was a 100 before, you're not splitting it 50/50, you end up with let's say a 49/49.You have to build both cores back up over time before you split it again, if you want it to work well.\n\nCradle (Aug. 25, 2018) #50 Share Copy\n\nQuestioner\n\nTime-wise, does Lindon's adventure occur before, after or simultaneously to Simon's?\n\nWill Wight\n\nTraveler's Gate takes place slightly before Cradle, and Elder Empire takes place after Cradle (or at least after where Cradle is now). I don't want to lock myself into anything more specific than that.\n\nCradle (Aug. 25, 2018) #51 Share Copy\n\nQuestioner\n\nWhat are the fundamental tenets of aura theory on Cradle?\n\nWill Wight\n\nIt's actually very different from culture to culture. We've spent the entirety of the series so far in the western half of the Blackflame Empire, so culturally it's all very similar. They see it as different though everything in nature radiates a different kind of power, and these can be blended and molded in order to shape your own madra. Other cultures see aura as one connected force, the spirit of the world, which takes on different forms (aspects) as it weaves through nature.\n\nCradle (Aug. 25, 2018) #52 Share Copy\n\nQuestioner\n\nHow did the Sage of the Endless Sword become a Sage?\n\nWill Wight\n\nAs an Archlord, the Sage of the Endless Sword was blessed enough to cross swords with a sword-wielding Monarch without getting obliterated. Swearing not to waste that opportunity, he tracked down an ancient Remnant called Memory, on the Path of a Thousand Dreams. She made sure his recollection of the fight would stay fresh, so he could experience the feeling of the Monarch's power every day as though for the first time. He began traveling from sword Path to sword Path, sensing their techniques and trying to develop a power closer to that of the Monarch's. As an experienced refiner, he also tracked down natural treasures attuned to the sword: spirit fruits, sacred herbs, and the parts of sacred beasts that gathered sword aura. ...this is where the story gets spoiler-y, but long story short, this quest led to him distinguishing himself as a Sage. Sorry for the anticlimax, but I have to dance around the details of how one becomes a Sage. Still, I hope that's enough.\n\nCradle (Aug. 25, 2018) #53 Share Copy\n\nQuestioner\n\nWhat do Judges do when they retire?\n\nWill Wight\n\nThat depends on the Judge. Many of them do drift into the shallow void, knitting fragments together into miniature Territory-like lesser worlds. So effectively yeah, they can take up world-knitting. Others return to their original worlds and live like gods; they may have given up their Mantle and weapon, but they're still extremely powerful beings. Most of them go to live in Sanctum, the home world of the Abidan. They take up advisory positions in the Abidan organization, though they're not allowed to wield any authority.\n\nCradle (Aug. 25, 2018) #54 Share Copy\n\nQuestioner\n\nHow would a meal of the same ingredients be different if made from someone of higher rank? Suck as Turkey. Assuming a culinary path, how would that Turkey differ when made by a low-gold, underlord, sage, or Herald?\n\nWill Wight\n\nI'm not sure if you're talking about the level of the chef or the level of a sacred turkey. So I'm going to answer both.The problem with eating sacred beasts is that they get more intelligent as they advance. Most cultures have the same taboos against this as they do against cannibalism.However, there are a few exceptions. Some powerful individuals don't care about the rights of those weaker than them, and will consume sacred beasts regardless of their intelligence. Other cultures have no taboo, but make sure that the beasts have died of natural causes. And sometimes when sacred beasts are born instead of awakened from advancement, they have all the power and none of the intelligence. Though this can be hard to prove.So in the latter case, where you might have a Truegold-level sacred turkey with the intelligence of a normal bird, let's assume you ate it. It's going to be very tough, so it's difficult to cook, but if you prepared it perfectly, you would find it to be an intense experience. The concentrated blood aura in the body gives the meat a powerful flavor that you might find physically uncomfortable until you get used to it. When processed with the appropriate herbs, it can be delicious...although usually served in small portions.It can also help to refine the body, strengthening you and promoting physical health.As for a chef, here's what they say in the Blackflame Empire:A Lowgold chef will prepare you a wonderful meal.A Highgold chef will cook you the best dish you've ever had in your life.A Truegold chef will serve you your new favorite food.\n\nCradle (Aug. 25, 2018) #55 Share Copy\n\nQuestioner\n\nWhat do people do on cradle who don't pursue sacred arts?\n\nWill Wight\n\nTo a degree, advancement in the sacred arts is an act of survival. Almost every adult on the planet is at least Iron, because that's essentially the minimum it takes to interact with the world on a normal level. However, many of Cradle's people don't consider themselves \"sacred artists\" per se, because their life does not revolve around the pursuit of advancement. Aura and madra are still a part of their lives, but not personal power and achievement. Cradle certainly has farmers, but farmers who can pull the rainclouds closer with Ruler techniques. They have chefs who can determine your tastes by reading your feelings, doctors who can diagnose you from across the room by sensing your blood, and carpenters who shape wood with their spirits.\n\nCradle (Aug. 25, 2018) #56 Share Copy\n\nQuestioner\n\nIs the a cycling technique that aids digestion?\n\nWill Wight\n\nThe Path of the Crimson Furnace has developed a cycling technique that they use in conjunction with their Iron bodies to eat as many spirit-fruits and sacred elixirs and pills as possible. They gorge themselves on sacred beast meat and sacred herbs, and then digest as quickly as possible. Their Iron body involves stuffing yourself to bursting and then using life madra to accelerate your body so that you digest it quickly. After about two weeks of this, combined with some pills they have developed for the purpose, your body becomes able to do it naturally. It's a great all-purpose Iron body; they are able to receive further benefits from elixirs that improve the body, and much of what they eat strengthens them and makes them tougher. The only downside is an accelerated metabolism: now they HAVE to eat all the time. At Jade, they have a cycling technique to go along with it. It allows them to milk further benefits out of restorative pills and elixirs, and extracts aura from the things they eat, improving advancement.\n\nCradle (Aug. 25, 2018) #57 Share Copy\n\nQuestioner\n\nHow do monarchs have babies on Cradle? Do they just appear instantly at the nine months stage? Do they rocket out of the womb at mach 9? The core is right below the navel, which is where a baby would be. Does this effect the baby or it's own developing core?\n\nWill Wight\n\nThe children of Monarchs are born just like anyone else. Monarchs are not only extremely powerful, they are also skilled at controlling their power; they're not going to harm their child unless they want to. When the baby is within the womb, the Monarch's own spirit protects it, and it is born normally. Monarchs have smoother and easier pregnancies than most women, due to their superhuman resilience. The children of Monarchs are often born with special advantages. Some bloodline legacies (powers inherited through lineage) are from sacred beasts that have taken human form, but others come from Monarch ancestors.\n\nCradle (Aug. 25, 2018) #58 Share Copy\n\nQuestioner\n\nWhy does thus far everyone seem to speak the same language and very similar dialect? Even the people in the Sacred Valley, who have been isolated for centuries, seem to speak the same language as is known throughout the Blackfire Empire.\n\nWill Wight\n\nLooks like the Sage has covered this in detail, but I'll throw in my two cents: we're still largely in the same region, but even then, I've thrown in some different accents. Fisher Gesha, Lindon, Yerin, and Eithan all speak in a different vernacular, and I imagine them as having subtly different accents.It's all *largely* the same because we haven't left the country, and because language has spread further than we might imagine based on our history in our world. For one thing, most of this world used to speak the same language (I'll probably get into the specifics of that at some point). It's drifted over the years, but less than you might think thanks to fairly widespread communication. Even though Cradle is a harsh world, a single sacred artist can travel much farther than a single real person, and nomadic tribes are common. There are also dream techniques for transferring language, which allows them to transfer speech much more efficiently.As for Eithan's accent specifically, he spent his childhood in the Blackflame Empire. He speaks the local dialect better than Yerin or Lindon do.There are, however, multiple languages in Cradle. As the world expands, we'll run into them.\n\nCradle (Aug. 25, 2018) #59 Share Copy\n\nQuestioner\n\nI would like to know about the ethno-geographical population distribution across the BlackFlame Empire and surrounding continent.\n\nWill Wight\n\nI'm going to try and respond to the general questions about ethnicity in Cradle, though I can't guarantee I'll hit all of your points. I'll try to answer the spirit of the question!Humans did not evolve independently on Cradle. The Abidan initially thought they did, as the first Abidan came from Cradle; they ascended out of the world only to discover many others, most with humans that were virtually identical.Naturally, they assumed that Cradle was the first world, but upon further investigation determined that it was not.They have never been able to conclusively prove what the first world was.The Blackflame Empire (and the whole continent) has a similar ethnic makeup to our east Asia. The genetics get a little muddy when you factor in sacred beasts that can breed with humans, as well as Paths that alter bloodlines, but that's a general rule of thumb.The Arelius family comes from a different continent. Their family is, as you might imagine, Caucasian in extraction.\n\nCradle (Aug. 25, 2018) #60 Share Copy\n\nQuestioner\n\nHas anybody on Cradle every left their world to go to the moon or another planet?\n\nWill Wight\n\nYes.

Consistent, recognizable rules. In some of these worlds, even forces like gravity or time work differently, but they do work consistently within the world. That's the influence of the Way.When the Abidan first started exploring the \"shape\" of the Way, they found it like a branching river, with Iterations like boulders in the stream. Outside the Way was the void: a hostile emptiness dotted with the fragments of broken worlds and populated by strange, unknowable creatures that sought to break rules and disrupt order.The farther you travel into the void, the more recognizable reality crumbles, until you cease to exist. Even these fiends of the void, incomprehensible nightmare beings, can only exist somewhat close to the Way, because existence itself is a function of order.However, when the Abidan organized, they determined that they would explore the scope and breadth of the Way. They followed each branch to its ending, until the power of the Way grew too thin to sustain them. Then they turned back.They found that the Way WAS finite. It had an end. They've mapped it like a three-dimensional spider web, like a branching skeletal ball. In and among its branches is the endless, infinite void.But their theory says that the Way should be infinite. There's no reason it should ever be contained, and indeed they've never seen it end; they've only followed it as far as they could.Some believe that the Way stretches across an endless cosmic darkness, and this is the only place it has pooled thickly enough to sustain life.Others believe that our Way is only one of many, and that there are other collections of reality out there. Perhaps an infinite number.\n\nCradle (Aug. 25, 2018) #62 Share Copy\n\nQuestioner\n\nAre there any sacred beasts (besides dragons) that could go toe-to-toe with a Monarch or a Dreadgod?\n\nWill Wight\n\nThere's Juwei, the Ghostwalker Fox, who has tricked Monarchs and escaped.

Like if somebody invented the computer on Cradle would it collect computer madra?\n\nWill Wight\n\nAll aspects of madra are essentially human interpretations of aura. You might notice a unique blend of aura around a computer, and you could break it down into storm aura and dream aura or what have you, or perhaps you could find a way to cycle it into your own madra and create what you called a \"computer Path.\" What would you be able to do?

That sounds like a confusing blend of madra.\n\nCradle (Aug. 25, 2018) #67 Share Copy\n\nQuestioner\n\nWhat sports do they play in cradle?\n\nWill Wight\n\nMost sports are combat-related (in some way), but there are a few that aren't. One sport involving getting a ball into a goal revolves around two teams of six people, each positioning themselves strategically on their half of the field. They have to use the sacred arts to maneuver the ball into the opposing goal without letting it touch the ground.Most of the rules exist to prevent them from attacking their opponents.\n\nCradle (Aug. 25, 2018) #68 Share Copy\n\nQuestioner\n\nHow does life madra affect other kinds if madra it is mixed with?\n\nWill Wight\n\nLife madra is strange. It's widely known on Cradle that your experience and the aspects of your Path affect how you perceive aura. Some types of less-tangible aura--like destruction, for instance--can't be detected by some people at all. These are usually the aspects that deal with intangible concepts. Therefore, in theory, life madra would be difficult for the average person to perceive. But it isn't. This is believed to be because we are all acclimated to life aura ourselves, as living beings, and because we're surrounded by plants and animals even before Copper. Life madra interacts with the force that animates a living being. HOW it interacts depends on the Path and the technique. Let's take life and fire, for instance. One Path might have a flame that uses life for fuel, consuming the target even underwater. Another Path might have a flame that ignites a life-fire and gives you inexhaustible life aura, meaning you have more energy and heal faster. It's a weird one.\n\nCradle (Aug. 25, 2018) #69 Share Copy\n\nQuestioner\n\nAre remnants capable of having a society? Is there anywhere with particularly intelligent remnants and what do they do on a daily basis\n\nWill Wight\n\nSome of them are intelligent enough and capable of forming a society, yes. However, they're still Remnants: they're bound by the nature of their madra and the impulses that drove them when they were formed. So they don't interact as naturally as people do, no matter how intelligent they are.On a daily basis, they pursue \"food,\" or compatible madra suitable to maintain their form and advance them. Some of the more intelligent Remnants have renewable sources of madra--which means human communities--where they can get their power, either from stealing scales or from making deals with humans.\n\nCradle (Aug. 25, 2018) #70 Share Copy\n\nQuestioner\n\nWhat can Dream madra do besides read Fate? Are Time and/or Space actual madra aspects?\n\nWill Wight\n\nDream madra affects thoughts and perception.Space madra is somewhat different than most aspects; it's not shaping madra INTO space, as that makes no sense, but there is a way to develop madra so that it affects space.\n\nCradle (Aug. 25, 2018) #71 Share Copy\n\nQuestioner\n\nWhat is the Cradle analogue of a TV ? Like what do average people do to chill ?\n\nWill Wight\n\nWhat people do to relax on Cradle varies wildly depending on where you are. Some people have access to devices that record audio and video, so they have what is essentially a TV. For cultures with advanced dream tablets, they have accessible virtual reality experiences, and use those for entertainment.And of course they have books and games and everything else people did to entertain themselves before TV.\n\nCradle (Aug. 25, 2018) #72 Share Copy\n\nQuestioner\n\nHow do people on Cradle get information quickly for the average person? Does somebody come around on horseback delivering mail? Does somebody on a speed path run around delivering and picking up letters? Is there a portal system in place?\n\nWill Wight\n\nMost countries have some kind of a postal system run by sacred artists who can travel long distances quickly. Some of them use sacred beasts as mounts, but others do run it by foot. There are also communication constructs that can relay information over distances. Most of them are more like telegraphs than telephones.\n\nCradle (Jan. 2, 2018) #73 Share Copy\n\nQuestioner\n\nWhat are some of the best entertainment professions?\n\nI know light and dream mandra would be great but are there any other specialties such as madra that would create fireworks or balance mandra that would make spectacular jugglers?\n\nWill Wight\n\nThere are entertainers with many different aspects of madra. Blood artists can sometimes give you physical impulses or emotions directly. There are actors on stone Paths who create their own scenery as they perform. Dream artists can store fantasies in a tablet, to be experienced by anyone. There are wind artists that can give you the experience of flying freely for a limited time.\n\nCradle (Jan. 2, 2018) #74 Share Copy\n\nQuestioner\n\nwhat is a Cradle calendar like?

They cycle aura every day, they practice their techniques, they hone their craft, and so on.\n\nSo while madra would be a part of everyone's everyday life, and while everyone has technically attained some advancement level in the sacred arts, not everyone is a sacred artist.\n\nCradle (Jan. 2, 2018) #81 Share Copy\n\nQuestioner\n\nHow does childhood development work in cradle? Especially in regards to higher tier families that can raise a baby to jade or gold in one pill. Taken to an extreme with luminous queen sha mirara, she inherited her power and is currently queen. Who controlled the super-charged baby when she was having fits? Also she only looks to be 10 or 11, if she is a monarch presumably she ages incredibly slowly, would she have the maturity of her true age? And what happens when she hits puberty? will she be affected by her hormones?\n\nWill Wight\n\nShe doesn't age any more slowly than anyone else until after she reaches maturity. Advancement doesn't lock you into your current age so much as it optimizes your body; she won't be sick a day in her life or suffer the debilitating effects of age.\n\nAs for the families that can raise their kids to Gold instantly, these families also have the power to easily control an immature Gold. If everyone in the family is an Underlord, a five-year-old Lowgold throwing a temper tantrum has the same relative power as a normal five-year-old throwing a temper tantrum.\n\nDanger only comes in two circumstances: when the child is more powerful than the family can contain, or when the child develops the power to hurt itself before the ability to resist/control itself.\n\nThose are the situations they're trying to prevent.

It revolves around nurturing a flame of life and fire that consumes anything living and is difficult to extinguish. It's a killing Path, and at its height it can depopulate cities.\n\nPath of Shadeleaf.

Even if you're spiritually injured, your Iron body still functions. It's a physical change in your body. But there are Iron bodies, like Lindon's, that require madra. In that case, you wouldn't see much benefit from it. Indeed, it might make your spiritual injuries even worse.\n\nCradle (Jan. 2, 2018) #84 Share Copy\n\nQuestioner\n\nHow would you, using cradle lingo in the blackflame empire, ask someone if they wanted to \"Netflix and chill\"?\n\nWill Wight\n\nIn the Blackflame Empire, you'd likely be asking a girl if she wanted to come cycle back at your place. There's no benefit to cycling together, so it's just a thin excuse she's meant to see through.\n\nCradle (Jan. 2, 2018) #85 Share Copy\n\nQuestioner\n\nOk will I need to know how old is Lindon and what is his birthday is\n\nAlso how Long is a day on cradle, a month on cradle, and a year on cradle\n\nWill Wight\n\nAs for the time on Cradle, it's the same time as ours. Why? Because it's easier to tell the story that way. I don't want you to have to remember custom details for how long times or distances are.\n\nSo they're all the standard measurements.\n\nOff the top of my head, I'm pretty sure Lindon is eighteen now. He doesn't have a birthday, so to speak. In Sacred Valley, they count every child's age up a year each new year.\n\nCradle (Jan. 2, 2018) #86 Share Copy\n\nQuestioner\n\nDoes the Will verse have ice cream (or a close analogue)?

I'm not a monster.\n\nSuriel: peanut butter ice cream with real nuts.\n\nGadrael: mint ice cream. No chocolate chips.\n\nOzriel: strawberries and cream flavor.\n\nMakiel: he doesn't eat ice cream, because there's no purpose to it.\n\nCradle (Jan. 2, 2018) #87 Share Copy\n\nQuestioner\n\nWhat is the smallest Sacred Beast to achieve underlord status in cradle?\n\nWill Wight\n\nNessandarius the Flea, Lord of the Bloodlight Path.\n\nHe has grown larger and more humanoid as he advanced, and after refining his body in soulfire, he now looks like a two-foot-tall hooded man.\n\nCradle (Jan. 2, 2018) #88 Share Copy\n\nQuestioner\n\nWhat is the food equivalent of chicken on cradle?\n\nWill Wight\n\nIt's chicken.

You could combine water and fire madra into a burning, fluid, liquid power...if you figured out a way to do it.\n\nCradle (Jan. 2, 2018) #90 Share Copy\n\nQuestioner\n\nIs/was there a country on cradle that leaves dangerous scripts/weapons around that children can accidentally use and kill themselves. And if so, how long did/will that country last before the population dies off?\n\nWill Wight\n\nI'm going to be honest: in most cultures on Cradle, child safety isn't a huge priority. Sacred arts schools often list their mortality rate, and a lower rate of survival is often considered a mark of a difficult, elite school for the most talented.\n\nMost of the cultures on Cradle have techniques, constructs, or weapons around that children could use to hurt themselves. The sad truth is, you have to lose a LOT of kids before it affects the population. And most cultures respond by having more children, rather than protecting the ones they have.\n\nCradle (Jan. 2, 2018) #91 Share Copy\n\nQuestioner\n\nHas anyone ever taken in cradle ever taken a spectre as a remnant to advance to gold.

However, they cycle naturally, so their advancement is different from humans. Orthos has been stuck at the Truegold stage for decades, and he has long since given up any hopes of reaching Underlord, even if his consciousness was stable enough to support the advancement.\n\nCradle (Jan. 2, 2018) #93 Share Copy\n\nQuestioner\n\nWhat's another absurdly weak or isolated place on Cradle and what would their Lindon look like?\n\nWill Wight\n\nThere's an underwater, sealed-off city at the bottom of the Trackless Sea that's surrounded by much more prosperous civilizations of aquatic sacred beasts.\n\nThe human population inside this city has developed mostly independently, just like Sacred Valley. Their Lindon would be anyone who, for whatever reason, couldn't master water aura and the Ruler techniques required to go outside the city.\n\nThat person would be like someone in our universe who can't use a car...not just someone who can't drive, but someone who is unable to get inside an automobile.\n\nCradle (Jan. 2, 2018) #94 Share Copy\n\nQuestioner\n\nWhat are some of the coolest Cycling techniques on Cradle (like the one that increases madra regeneration, or maybe a technique that would make Ruler techniques easier, or a technique that acts like a Halfsilver Ring, etc.)\n\nWill Wight\n\nThere's the Endless Revolving Cycle technique, which focuses entirely on madra regeneration, to the exclusion of all else. Their advancement isn't as fast, and they can't put an enormous amount of power into their techniques, but they can effectively use sacred arts all day long. They have to use elixirs to strengthen their madra channels in order to withstand the strain of constant use.\n\nCradle (Jan. 2, 2018) #95 Share Copy\n\nQuestioner\n\nIf Lindon were to die and release a remnant, would he in fact produce two remnants because of his two cores, a single hybrid remnant, or two conjoined remnants?\n\nWill Wight\n\nIt would be a conjoined Remnant, not two Remnants. It would be unstable at first, as the pure madra began to dilute the Blackflame madra, but would eventually stabilize.It would be less powerful and aggressive than a full Blackflame Remnant, but it would be less likely to randomly attack people, which would probably increase its likelihood of finding a food source.\n\nCradle (Jan. 2, 2018) #96 Share Copy\n\nQuestioner\n\nWhere in your collective works would I go for the spiciest dish? As a corollary, how much trouble am I in for?\n\nWill Wight\n\nCradle. There's a pepper that grows in chambers beneath active volcanoes, where fire aura is most intense.\n\nEven if you just took the plant out of that area and brought it to the surface, you couldn't go within five hundred yards of the pepper without the heat being so intense it would make you turn back.\n\nThis is what those above Archlords use to season their food.\n\nCradle (Jan. 2, 2018) #97 Share Copy\n\nQuestioner\n\nWhat's life like for the average person in Sanctum? Are they living it up in a post scarcity universe, or are they still doing the 9 to 5 grind?\n\nWill Wight\n\nPeople in Sanctum have their basic needs met in a peaceful, prosperous world, but their society is engineered so that everyone has the opportunity to play a part. The Abidan see people as a valuable resource, so they've done their best to make sure that everyone has the opportunity to provide a benefit to society.\n\nSome people choose not to, of course. And some people hate doing what they're best at, but they do it anyway. People are people.\n\nCradle (Jan. 2, 2018) #98 Share Copy\n\nQuestioner\n\nAre there any madra viruses in cradle? Like the same way a virus in real life is basically a random peice of DNA which uses cells to replicate itself, are there techniques which implant themselves in someone’s spirit and force a copy of themselves? And if so, would they differ by stage and advancement?\n\nWill Wight\n\nThere are techniques like this, but they aren't as overpowered as you might think thanks to a simple rule: your own spirit is sovereign within your body.\n\nIt's the same reason why a water or blood artist wouldn't just stop your heart instantly. They can't. Your spirit is far stronger inside your body than anyone else's madra.\n\nYou can overcome that by a huge difference in power: a Herald could stop a thousand Underlords' hearts all at once. But techniques that insert themselves into enemies' bodies tend to degrade very quickly and do limited damage.\n\nCradle (Jan. 2, 2018) #99 Share Copy\n\nQuestioner\n\nWhat were the original blackflames goldsign?\n\nWill Wight\n\nA dragon's tail.

So I'm going to cop out by sharing with you some Yerin-isms that may or may not have made it into the series so far:\n\n\"Between a tiger and a rocky cliff\" = Between a rock and a hard place.\n\n“There’s always a higher heaven” = always a bigger fish.\n\n“Hitched to the same wagon” = in the same boat.\n\n“Eating from the same pot” = (see above)\n\n“Flower” = sweetie/sugar.

Parts of it are genetic, but a character from another world might come to Asylum, for instance, and find that they were getting faint impressions or visions by touching objects. They are suitable to be a Reader.\n\nCradle (Jan. 2, 2018) #104 Share Copy\n\nQuestioner\n\nMaybe a story about the Paths or lives of the first people who cycled on Cradle?

ARE YOU READY TO HAVE YOUR ILLUSIONS SHATTERED AND THE DISAPPOINTING TRUTH REVEALED?\n\n...I've never thought about that. I've planned out the history of the Abidan and the development of most of Cradle's continents, as well as organized sacred arts, but I've never thought about how primitive sacred arts first emerged.\n\nThat's an untapped area for me.\n\nCradle (Jan. 2, 2018) #105 Share Copy\n\nQuestioner\n\nWould you ever hold a fan-made Path competition?\n\nWill Wight\n\nMaybe. I'm not against it, and in fact something along those lines sounds like a lot of fun. I've always wanted to work in a world that we as a community designed together, though I usually imagine that as building a world from the ground up with a bunch of fans in a Twitch- or Patreon-like setting.\n\nBut it's not like I actually NEED fan submissions to fill out the world. When I run into a new sacred artist and I need to make up a new Path, I just...do.\n\nCradle (Jan. 2, 2018) #106 Share Copy\n\nQuestioner\n\nDo you have tons of notes on a magic system and slowly reveal more over time, or is the creative process more organic in how they develop?\n\nWill Wight\n\nA little of both. I usually start out with a ton of detailed notes and then let it develop from there.\n\nVital aura, for instance. I know exactly how I wanted aura to work, but I had trouble describing it clearly in Unsouled, so I started tweaking the rules and principles in later books and let it deviate from what I originally intended and found difficult to explain.\n\n...although in doing so I kind of tripped over my own feet a little bit, because describing it only gets more difficult when you change your mind, but oh well.

Simon's smaller, more slender, and has more delicate features.\n\nSimon, however, would literally starve to death before he took such a course. He'd rather die on his own terms than sell his dignity.\n\nLindon would do what he had to.\n\nCradle (Jan. 2, 2018) #109 Share Copy\n\nQuestioner\n\nIf all of your protagonists had to take the SAT's and the GRE's, who would score the best? Who would score the lowest?\n\nWill Wight\n\nFor everyone on his list, we have to assume that they don't get questions that are impossible for them to answer. Like questions relating to Earth's literature or technology.\n\nYerin would score the worst, as she's illiterate and would have no idea what to do with the tests.\n\nSimon would be second-worst. His parents only cared about his education until the events of the HoB prologue, when he was eight years old. After that, the only math skill he exercised was counting, and he rarely wrote anything besides his name.\n\nCalder is next up. He received a noble education, thanks to his mother, but not early in life. He would score better in math than in English (assuming we translated the fictional Imperial language he actually speaks into English), and his scores would be decent in both categories.\n\nLeah would do better than Calder, but not much better. She's extremely well-educated, but to the limits of her time period and world.\n\nLindon's education is more suited to standardized tests; he actually learned math and linguistics (obviously he's not speaking English, as none of these characters are) from textbooks, and while his scientific education is either not applicable to our tests or is downright wrong even by Cradle standards, his mathematical and language skills are solid.\n\nShera would do the best. Gardeners got a great education and she has a well-trained memory and a precise mind. She would score higher than any of my other protagonists.\n\n...if she could be bothered to finish the test.\n\nCradle (Jan. 2, 2018) #110 Share Copy\n\nQuestioner\n\nOn a scale of baby snow bunny to eldritch-horror who is scarier when fully equipped.

He's kind of a rough-looking guy anyway, and he gets the dark aura of the Burning Cloak, demonic eyes, a skeletal arm, and a big, hulking, burning turtle.\n\nCradle (Jan. 2, 2018) #111 Share Copy\n\nQuestioner\n\nIf Lindon had access to all the books you've read, what would be his favorite novel?\n\nWill Wight\n\nThe Martian, by Andy Weir.It would blow his mind.\n\nCradle (Jan. 2, 2018) #112 Share Copy\n\nQuestioner\n\nWhat is Yerin’s favorite color?\n\nIf Yerin fought against Shera, who would win?\n\nWill Wight\n\n1.)

Say someone who, out of ignorance, got a poorly matching iron body, or cultivated a really weird mix of auras.\n\nWill Wight\n\nThis is a great question. I like this question.\n\nThe Beast King is a Herald (right below Monarch) who was crippled as a child while attempting to gain his Iron body. He refocused his Path into communicating with animals, using a mix of life and dream aura. Despite being unable to walk, he ended up befriending some truly ancient sacred beasts, and with their help baptized his body in soulfire and ascended to Underlord.\n\nHe's now many levels above that, and can walk just fine, but without the foundation of an Iron body he's physically not as dominant as his peers.\n\nHowever, he's guarded by enormous behemoths from the deep places of the earth, so it balances out.\n\nCradle (Jan. 2, 2018) #114 Share Copy\n\nQuestioner\n\nAlso, what path would be best suited to creating an army of forged madra garden gnome soldiers?\n\nWill Wight\n\nPath of the Clay Walkers.\n\nLife and stone. They craft clay golems from special clay and other materials, kneading their madra into the dolls and bringing them to life under their control. It's not an especially powerful Path, but it's useful for a variety of mundane tasks.\n\nLike creating a parade of garden gnomes.\n\nCradle (Jan. 2, 2018) #115 Share Copy\n\nQuestioner\n\nHow fast can Suriel fly?\n\nWill Wight\n\nSuriel slows down to the speed of sound when she's in atmosphere so she doesn't destroy anything.

She'll have some fights, but fights among Judge-level individuals are less \"I'm going to punch you,\" and more \"I predicted where you were going to be standing and I already willed that space out of existence.\"\n\nCradle (Jan. 2, 2018) #117 Share Copy\n\nQuestioner\n\nHow does the Eight Man Empire work?\n\nWill Wight\n\nThe Eight-Man Empire operate collectively, not individually. Suriel singles one out in order to give Lindon perspective, but their powers are very limited when they're not working in formation with the other seven.\n\nNot that they're pushovers individually, but yes, Reigan Shen would eat them alive* if they tried to fight him separately.\n\n*Not literally.\n\n...maybe literally.\n\nCradle (Jan. 2, 2018) #118 Share Copy\n\nQuestioner\n\nHow would Simon compare to people on Cradle?\n\nWill Wight\n\nSteel reinforces your body in general, so your muscles and bones are able to handle a greater degree of stress. It affects your skin to some degree too, but not like it's going to turn a knife blade. There would just be a little more resistance before it cut you. Turning a knife blade is what the stone is for.\n\nIn terms of Iron bodies, the \"perfect\" Iron bodies introduced in Soulsmith are specialized. So some of them would have tougher skin, others would have greater strength, others heal faster. In general, leaving aside the specialization, an Iron body is just the result of your spirit improving and to some degree perfecting your body. It's a general physical upgrade.\n\nSimon, when drawing on the Valinhall powers, would be better than an Iron body. But a sacred artist would also be using Enforcer techniques, which could compete on the same level. It would depend on the specific situation, but in general, Simon is going to be Underlord-level physically with his mask on. Truegold-level would be his peak without it.\n\nOf course, that's purely in terms of physical strength and ability. Also, there would be some Enforcer-focused Underlords who might be able to trade punches with him in the mask, and then when the mask wore off, they would tear him apart.\n\nCradle (Jan. 2, 2018) #119 Share Copy\n\nQuestioner\n\nI know that splitting your core was created by the rival of the first Empty Palm-user. I just do not think that Simon and the rival are the only people in the world who have thought of this. Surely their must be others. Also, can one keep splitting their core repeatedly. I can imagine how strong Lindon could he be if he had multiple paths in his body. I'm still unclear if splitting your core doubles your madra and if it has a cost. Another thing that comes to mind is can Lindon upgrade one of his cores to jade while still having his other core at the copper-level?\n\nWill Wight\n\nThis will be explored in Blackflame, but I don't really consider it a spoiler, as it deals with mechanics we've already seen in the books.\n\nIf you're especially allergic to SPOILERS, stop reading now.\n\nNow!\n\nNo, the Heart of Twin Stars is not the only technique in the world for splitting cores. Others have done it, and I expect we'll run into them.\n\nYes, you can split your core repeatedly.\n\nSplitting your core does not double your madra, and there's a very slight loss in energy when you split. So if you had 100 MP before the split, now you have two sources of 49 MP each. The other 2 MP are lost in the process.\n\nHe can upgrade one core without the other. At the end of Soulsmith, one of his cores is Iron and the other Copper. But he's considered an Iron, because his body was upgraded.\n\nHere's something else that will be dealt with in Blackflame: an Iron core split into two doesn't make two Copper cores, it makes two very small Iron cores. Your stage of advancement is based on the quality of your madra, not the amount.\n\nCradle (Jan. 2, 2018) #120 Share Copy\n\nQuestioner\n\nWait a sec, could Suriel banish the Doctor out of Space and Time?\n\nWill Wight\n\nOut of her space and her timeline, sure.\n\nCradle (Jan. 2, 2018) #121 Share Copy\n\nQuestioner\n\nIm starting to realize you cant kill Suriel.

She draws her power from the Way, the force of pure order that keeps time, space, and reality in the universe on track. There are beings that draw from pure chaos, disrupting that order. There are also entities that could cut off her access to the Way, or out-predict and maneuver her into a situation where she could be destroyed.\n\n...but all that comes in later books.\n\nCradle (Jan. 2, 2018) #122 Share Copy\n\nQuestioner\n\nOkay guys these are the strongest characters1.

Urzia, Meia and other enhanced warroirs6. Ragnarus Incarnation7. Valinhall\n\nWill Wight\n\nThat's just about right!\n\n#3 is a broad variety of characters over several different power levels--the Ninecloud Court princess and Northstrider are a level beyond Li Markuth and the Sword Sage, who are both a level beyond Underlord. Some of those would defeat the Emperor and the sealed Great Elders easily, some would have a hard time, and some of them couldn't do it.\n\nAlso #5-7 are all very close. Valinhall can compete with the Champions, but they would be difficult fights. And while the Ragnarus Incarnation is the strongest Incarnation thus far, and thus a notch above Valinhall/the Champions, in the end (City of Light SPOILER ALERT, I guess) a Valinhall Traveler DID beat him.\n\nBut I'd still put him a notch above them in terms of pure power level.\n\nCradle (Jan. 2, 2018) #123 Share Copy\n\nQuestioner\n\nWhat about Kelarac vs. Suriel?

It's how the Great Elders came to be sealed in that world in the first place.\n\nAnd the versions the Emperor and Estyr Six dealt with were pale shadows of the entities Suriel would be dealing with.

She is reluctant to take on this responsibility, so she would drag her feet searching worlds where she knows Ozriel wouldn't go, with Cradle chief among them. While in Cradle, she would distract herself by intervening in a small problem she can control, and then watch events play out in the same way that some people keep plants on their windowsills just to watch them grow. It soothes her. It's like a desktop zen garden.\n\nThen circumstances would force her to get back to her task, and she would continue searching for Ozriel, encountering a number of obstacles and surprising truths along the way.\n\nCradle (Jan. 2, 2018) #126 Share Copy\n\nQuestioner\n\nEldest Nye versus Suriel 1.0- the prior bearer of Suriel's mantle.

When they give up a mantle does that make them more or less human?\n\nWill Wight\n\nEldest Nye vs. Former Suriel\n\nThey're more human when they pass on the mantle, and they lose access to the former extent of their powers.\n\nHowever, this only means that he would be unable to tear Valinhall apart with the force of her will alone. He'd still have his millennia of experience and skills, as well as his personal power.\n\nHowever, he's scarred from killing people so he would likely stall, which the Eldest Nye would not do, and the Eldest has the backup of the entire House.\n\nIn the end, I don't think the Eldest has enough firepower to kill even a mortal Suriel. In the end, Suriel 1.0 would probably just find a method to cut through the Way and leave.\n\nCradle (Jan. 2, 2018) #127 Share Copy\n\nQuestioner\n\nYerin vs. Simon\n\nWill Wight\n\nYerin wouldn't get absolutely smoked against no-mask Simon, but I do think she would lose.

The reason the Abidan value Cradle is because it nurtures and produces extremely powerful individuals.\n\nA fight against Yerin's master would be pretty even.

She's trained longer with the sword, she would be physically weaker than him but not so much that she would be overwhelmed, and she can do crazy magic things that Simon can't.\n\nCradle (Jan. 2, 2018) #131 Share Copy\n\nQuestioner\n\nJai Long's white spear vs. Leah's Ragnarus spear\n\nWill Wight\n\nJai Long's white spear breaks immediately and shatters to dust. The Lightning Spear continues on, its momentum barely halted, and runs into Jai Long, who has to expend a great deal of his power to stop it. He lives, but he's wounded, exhausted, and on the back foot.\n\nCradle (Jan. 2, 2018) #132 Share Copy\n\nQuestioner\n\nThe Abidan court\n\nWill Wight\n\nThat said, the Abidan do not have the ability to create new worlds. They've lost that power.\n\nCradle (Jan. 2, 2018) #133 Share Copy\n\nQuestioner\n\nLi Markuth vs. Yerin's master and Eithan\n\nWill Wight\n\nYerin's master and Eithan take it. In fact, Yerin's master might be able to do it without Eithan's help. Maybe. He and Li Markuth are on a similar level.\n\nCradle (Jan. 2, 2018) #134 Share Copy\n\nQuestioner\n\nElder Whisper vs. Blackflame Turtle\n\nWill Wight\n\nThere is no defense against raw Turtle Power.\n\nCradle (Jan. 2, 2018) #135 Share Copy\n\nQuestioner\n\nEithan vs. Elder Whisper\n\nWill Wight\n\nEithan does win.\n\nCradle (Jan. 2, 2018) #136 Share Copy\n\nQuestioner\n\nElder Whisper vs. Asphodel Incarnation\n\nWill Wight\n\nThis would be another one of those really interesting, sort of irritating fights where everyone is trying to figure out what is real and what's just an illusion.\n\nHonestly, I think this probably comes down to chance. One of them falls into the other's trap first, and it's 50-50 who.\n\nCradle (Jan. 2, 2018) #137 Share Copy\n\nQuestioner\n\nStrongest sacred artist vs. a Great Elder\n\nWill Wight\n\nIt's hard to say who the strongest Great Elder is, because they each measure strength differently.However, the strongest sacred artist in Cradle would be able to solo any of the Great Elders. Of course, that would only disperse them and make them spend centuries re-forming, since they don't treat death the same way mortals do, but it's enough for the sacred artist to win the battle.\n\nCradle (Jan. 2, 2018) #138 Share Copy\n\nQuestioner\n\nEmperor vs. Emperor\n\nWill Wight\n\nThe Aurelian Emperor COULD win this, but only if he had time to prepare. If they're both tossed into an arena without warning, the Blackflame Emperor takes it. His weapon and his sacred arts are always with him.\n\nCradle (Jan. 2, 2018) #139 Share Copy\n\nQuestioner\n\nBlackflame Emperor vs. Sword Sage\n\nWill Wight\n\nThe BF Emperor is one stage lower than any Sage, and he knows that. If he were forced to do battle against a Sage, he would seek to die with honor and dignity, acquitting himself as well as possible.\n\nCradle (Jan. 2, 2018) #140 Share Copy\n\nQuestioner\n\nWhy did Li Markuth make it out of Cradle?\n\nWill Wight\n\nHe did not make it to the top of the power scale and then ascend, but he did make it out.\n\nSo there must be other ways out of Cradle...\n\nCradle (Jan. 2, 2018) #141 Share Copy\n\nQuestioner\n\nSauron vs. Sha Miara\n\nWill Wight\n\nThis hasn't been explored yet, but basically the nature of Sha Miara's madra is countering and controlling other people's skills.\n\nHe could raise armies, and she could banish them or take them over. Any spell he cast, she could break it.\n\nMore than that, at her level, she could simply walk into Mordor. She'd leave it a crater. She's the nuclear weapon of her nation.\n\nCradle (Jan. 2, 2018) #142 Share Copy\n\nQuestioner\n\nWhat about Yerin with Valinhall powers VS. Calder with Valinhall powers?\n\nWill Wight\n\nMan, that's a cool question.I'll still give it to Yerin, for the reasons stated above. Calder has training in fencing and experience using a saber, but it's not like he was trained as the disciple of a wandering swordsman.If they can use their previous powers, Calder being a Reader adds an interesting dimension to the Valinhall powers, but it doesn't touch having an Iron body on TOP of the ability to call steel, plus Striker and Ruler techniques.\n\nCradle (Jan. 2, 2018) #143 Share Copy\n\nQuestioner\n\nI find it more interesting to delve into what Suriel and the Abidan court actually is... are they \"gods\" or \"architects\" ???Will we ever know?\n\nWill Wight\n\nThey're like rulers and guardians of an interdimensional system that's sort of like a government, designed to keep the Iterations under their control safe, separated, and as free from outside intervention as possible.\n\nCradle (Jan. 2, 2018) #144 Share Copy\n\nQuestioner\n\nHow does the Presence work? Is it a construct. A drudge? Both? Does Suriel even have a Remnant? I think not as she can't die.\n\nWill Wight\n\nA drudge is a particular type of construct. A Presence is something like a construct, only much more advanced.\n\nYou could think of it as a magical computer made of thoughts.\n\nAnd Suriel did not grow up in Cradle. The FIRST Abidan came from Cradle, and MANY Abidan still do, but not ALL of them do.\n\nCradle (Jan. 2, 2018) #145 Share Copy\n\nQuestioner\n\nWhat color is Suriel's skin?Is it blue like Gadrael. Or can Judges have normal human skin also? I picture it as either fair or light blue.\n\nWill Wight\n\nIt's pale, like a white human's. She started off human, actually, though Gadrael didn't.\n\nCradle (Jan. 2, 2018) #146 Share Copy\n\nQuestioner\n\nNorthstrider vs. the Eight-Man Empire\n\nWill Wight\n\nThis would be a huge, destructive conflict with lots of collateral damage, but eventually I think Northstrider would probably win. The EME don't really have the firepower to beat him quickly, so they would be relying on a drawn-out contest, but he would be coming at them as hard and as fast as possible.\n\nCradle (Jan. 2, 2018) #147 Share Copy\n\nQuestioner\n\nNorthstrider vs. Sha Miara\n\nWill Wight\n\nSha Miara wins due to a mismatch of powers. If she knows what his powers are like and how they work, she can shut them down directly.In a contest of pure force, she would get annihilated.\n\nCradle (Jan. 2, 2018) #148 Share Copy\n\nQuestioner\n\nUnderlords vs. Underlord+\n\nWill Wight\n\nThe Sword Sage and Li Markuth are both roughly two stages above Underlord.\n\nThe three entities listed by Suriel as the top of the Cradle food chain are FIVE stages above Underlord, including one big leap (like the difference between Truegold and Underlord, it's only one stage, but it's a big one). The Dreadgods are a threat on THEIR level--and notice that Suriel said the 8-Man Empire, Sha Miara, and Northstrider could save Sacred Valley from them. She didn't say they could destroy the Dreadgods.\n\nThe BF Emperor is the one person in the Empire who is a level over Underlord.\n\nThe EE Emperor is about his level, although since they're using different magic systems, it's less about stages and more about what they can and can't do to counter one another.\n\nCradle (Jan. 2, 2018) #149 Share Copy\n\nQuestioner\n\nEight-Man Empire versus Sha Miara...\n\nWill Wight\n\nShe'd have more difficulty dealing with them as opposed to Northstrider, because they're relying on individual power and a formation that manipulates aura when they fight. In the end, it's roughly even, and it depends on a bunch of variables, but here's the bottom line: if Sha Miara can figure out and break their formation quickly, she wins. If she can't, they're sharing and pooling power, and they will overwhelm her.\n\nCradle (Jan. 2, 2018) #150 Share Copy\n\nQuestioner\n\nWhat qualities did Yerin have that made the Sword Sage take her on as a disciple?\n\nWill Wight\n\nThis gets into spoiler territory, because I will be answering that question thoroughly in the series, but suffice it to say that she was born strong. And she demonstrated that at an early age.\n\nCradle (Jan. 2, 2018) #151 Share Copy\n\nQuestioner\n\nMetaphysical Great Elders can rip one apart on the molecular level. You said the strongest Cradle character could solo them. Do they have defenses against that?\n\nWill Wight\n\nYes, they do have a defense against that. At a certain point, your spirit gets strong enough that your madra gives you essentially complete control over your own body. You can resist forces that would affect you directly.\n\nAlso, at that level, they have access to powers other than madra that can fight against the Great Elders.\n\nCradle (Jan. 2, 2018) #152 Share Copy\n\nQuestioner\n\nAre Cradle characters stronger than any other Iteration?\n\nWill Wight\n\nNo, but they have the best average growth rate. It's extremely rare for someone of another Iteration to ascend past their starting power scale, but with Cradle it happens reliably 2-3 times per generation.\n\nCradle (Jan. 2, 2018) #153 Share Copy\n\nQuestioner\n\nThe people who have been asking how strong Simon would eventually become in the grand scheme of things have been making me think that it would actually be really interesting to see the Cradle universe from the perspective of a character that isn't from Cradle eventually. Especially given how broad the outside world's powers seem to be, compared to the relatively narrow set of powers Travellers have. So it would be interesting to see Simon go beyond the Traveller's Gate world (how does the limitation of Valinhall's chains interact with the seemingly unlimited power in the outside universe?)\n\nWill Wight\n\nMild spoiler alert, but if you're this deep into this thread and you still care about spoilers...RIP you.\n\nEventually, we'll get to see how the Cradle magic system stacks up against others.\n\nAlso, Valin gathered the Valinhall powers essentially by running around outside.\n\nCradle (Jan. 2, 2018) #154 Share Copy\n\nQuestioner\n\nI was quite disappointed at Kelsa disappearing from the story given she was probably my favorite Unsouled character :p\n\nWill Wight\n\nEarly on in development, I had considered having Kelsa traveling with Lindon, and Yerin's character being a guy. But I couldn't justify Kelsa's presence, really, and I thought Yerin worked better as a woman. So Kelsa got left behind.\n\nThat's...certainly not the last we'll see of her, though. Spoilers.\n\nCradle (Jan. 2, 2018) #155 Share Copy\n\nQuestioner\n\nElder Whisper vs. Li Markuth\n\nWill Wight\n\nElder Whisper might be able to hide and run, if the terms of the battle allow such a thing. But Li Markuth very well might be able to catch him, and if he can, then Li Markuth wins it. He's a level above Whisper.\n\nCradle (Jan. 2, 2018) #156 Share Copy\n\nQuestioner\n\nWait, so Elder Whisper is a level above Underlord?!! That is CRAZY AWESOME!\n\nWill Wight\n\nNo no, Whisper isn't THAT strong. He's several levels under Li Markuth, it's just that Markuth would be relying solely on the brute force of his spiritual senses to find Whisper, whereas Whisper has hundreds of years of experience as an illusionist for running and hiding.He is, however, by far the strongest active being in Sacred Valley.\n\nCradle (Jan. 2, 2018) #157 Share Copy\n\nQuestioner\n\nHow many monarchs are their within cradle?\n\nWill Wight\n\nThere are eight currently, if we count the Eight-Man Army as one. Which we do, because individually none of them are a Monarch-level power.\n\nCradle (Jan. 2, 2018) #158 Share Copy\n\nQuestioner\n\nso what's yerin's bra size?\n\nWill Wight\n\nHaving never picked out a bra myself, I don't fully understand bra sizing. Therefore I'm going to go with the safe answer and say I don't know.\n\nCradle (Jan. 2, 2018) #159 Share Copy\n\nQuestioner\n\nOh by the way is Akura Mercy a refiner or is studying to be one, or did she just have easy to use healing/medical elixir with her in the Skysworn exam.\n\nWill Wight\n\nShe just keeps some on her in case of emergency.\n\nFor the record, I'm still CONSIDERING doing a story in Sacred Valley after Lindon left. I just have to be careful how I do it, to avoid the dreaded spoilerinos.\n\nAs for before Lindon left, that's not a bad idea. Or even before Lindon was born.\n\nCradle (Jan. 2, 2018) #160 Share Copy\n\nQuestioner\n\nWould linden have won if he was allowed all of the constructs against the Jai clan?\n\nWill Wight\n\nProbably, but he knew he almost certainly wouldn't be allowed. It was a long shot.\n\nCradle (Jan. 2, 2018) #161 Share Copy\n\nQuestioner\n\nAre some people in cradle aware of other world with normal people in them?\n\nWill Wight\n\nYes, there are people on Cradle aware of the existence and nature of other worlds.\n\nCradle (Jan. 2, 2018) #162 Share Copy\n\nQuestioner\n\nThe other Raccoon Families have brought up a good point about Gokren, the Sandviper TrueG"
