And Piccolo.\n\nI’m glad we have the Elder Supreme Kai, overseer of the entire universe, here to explain to Goku that people die when they’re on a planet and it explodes.\n\nAs for Mr. Satan, he doesn’t realize that he’s no longer on Earth, so he thinks it’s just fine. Of course, this is the Supreme Kai Planet, but how could he possibly know that?\n\nOne question: How does Mr. Satan think he got here? I mean, he doesn’t know that he was teleported, but he’s surely noticed that they’re in a completely different place where Majin Buu isn’t.\n\nDende tries to explain DBZ cosmology to Mr. Satan, and he asks why the Supreme Kais didn’t do something to stop Majin Buu.\n\nIt’s a fair point. When the Supreme Kais were first introduced, they were treated like revered figures, too holy to approach, let alone visit on their home planet. Now, they’ve been thoroughly exposed as jobbers to the stars.\n\nThen Mr. Satan realizes this is all a dream, which is also a fair point, because look. I’ve been covering this anime from the first episode up until now. Let me assure you, none of this makes any friggin’ sense. And really, it started to make even less sense once Mr. Satan showed up, almost like Akira Toriyama was daring Mr. Satan to realize that this is all a ridiculous fantasy. Like Dumbledore said, of course it’s a dream, but does that make it any less real? And guess what, Dumbledore ain’t real either, so my point is that yes, none of this is really happening.\n\nSo Mr. Satan decides to control the dream and fly into space and kick Buu’s ass. Yeah, none of this may be real, but Buu still killed his daughter, so that has to be answered for. But then he falls and hurts himself.\n\nVegeta’s all sore at Goku for saving that goofball instead of their kids, but he won’t be complaining in a few more episodes when Mr. Satan saves his life. Oh, uh, spoilers.\n\nWhat happened to Buu? Well, blowing up the Earth didn’t hurt him at all, so he’s fine. More importantly, he can teleport to other planets now, using the teleportation technique Kibitoshin used to save Goku and the others.\n\nI should note here that this is not the same as Goku’s instant transmission. I suppose Buu might have learned that power as well, since he fought Goku enough times to have seen it in action. I’m not sure that Kid Buu remembers anything the previous Buu’s experienced, though. In any case, Goku has to teleport by sensing ki energy. Kibito could teleport anywhere in the universe, although we never saw him use this ability except for taking people from Earth to the Supreme Kai Planet and back. I suspect that he can’t teleport over short distances. For example, he flew all the way to Babidi’s spaceship, instead of teleporting part of the way to save time. And he had to search for the Supreme Kai on foot. Wait, maybe he teleported to Gohan when they rescued him? I forgot.\n\nAnyway, what Kid Buu is doing now is using his new ability to hop from planet to planet, destroying each one. This is what he used to do with Bibidi, only I think they used a spaceship to get from place to place. Now, Buu can wipe out hundreds of planets in a few minutes.\n\nI always liked the look of this planet. Funimation’s streaming quality nosedived when I got to this part, but these alien structures look like skyscrapers, and this purple fog could be just about anything. We know absolutely nothing about this planet except that Buu chose to destroy it next, and they probably had no idea he was coming.\n\nThe Elder Kai suspects that Buu is searching for Goku and Vegeta. He knows those two have strong ki, so he’s searching for strong ki signatures and traveling to them. So that planet bought the dust because it had some above average life force, but it didn’t have Goku and Vegeta on it. Tough break.\n\nThings look pretty grim, until Dende remembers that they don’t need the Earth’s Dragon Balls, which were destroyed along with the planet. They can just go to New Namek and borrow their Dragon Balls, and wish everyone back with those.\n\nOkay, so what drives me nuts about this is that… Look was there anyone who didn’t see this coming when they watched it for the first time? The first 107 episodes of DBZ were about how there’s a second set of Dragon Balls on Planet Namek. When Goku asked to stay dead, he had to do that because the others were all set to go to New Namek and wish Goku back to life to get around Shenron’s no-doubles rule.\n\nSo as soon as things started to get really bad with Majin Buu, the very first thing I thought of was “Well, they’ll probably end up using the Namekian Dragon Balls to fix this.” Especially during the Gotenks episodes, because they made such a big deal about how Dende or the Dragon Balls might get destroyed during the fighting. Well who cares, when there’s another set?\n\nBut no one ever mentions it, even as a failsafe in case things get really bad. Not until this episode, when Dende remembers what planet he’s from. And then everyone is like “Oh wow, that’s right, good thinking, Dende!” while the audience is slapping their collective foreheads. I mean, Vegeta was the first one to deduce that the Namekians have their own set of Dragon Balls. Goku’s been to New Namek before. The Supreme Kais are the Supreme Kais. How is it that neither one of them was aware of this until now?\n\nSo Toriyama covers that one by establishing that Kibitoshin never heard of them before, while the Elder Kai simply objects to their use on general principle. I guess he was okay with using Earth’s Dragon Balls to solve an Earth problem, but he thinks that the Namekians shouldn’t use Porunga to interfere in other planets’ affairs. This is the same guy who literally took his own life just so Goku could have another crack at Buu, because he knew the whole universe was at stake.\n\nSo Goku tries to persuade him to look the other way on this, because Goku was going to let him kiss Bulma, but they can’t do that while she’s dead, so this is the only way to bring her back. Also, he promises to throw in lewd photos, which is dumb because the Elder Kai already told Goku that he doesn’t need porn because he can just peep on naked women anywhere in the universe, at any time.\n\nAnyway, Vegeta overhears this and loses his shit.\n\nWhile they argue about this, Kid Buu makes his way to the Grand Kai Planet, where Krillin and Yamcha are training.\n\nKibitoshin gives Goku and Vegeta his earrings, thinking they can become Vegito once again and defeat Buu with ease, but we already know Vegeta wants no part of that. But before he can object, Goku speaks up and says thanks, but no thanks.\n\nFor one thing, Buu is no longer fused or merged with any other being, so it wouldn’t be fair to use fusion against him. This didn’t seem to bother Goku when he first proposed fusion as a way to stop Buu, before he knew Buu’s situation, but I think you can make the argument that he’s considered what Vegeta’s had to say about fusion, and he’s buying into it.\n\nWhat’s always stuck with me about this episode is how amazed and impressed Vegeta is to hear this out of Goku’s mouth. Goku, the man he accused of sandbagging during their fight in the Babidi Saga. Goku, the man who convinced him to use the Potara in the first place, because there was too much at stake to be “particular”. In the dub, Vegeta accused Goku of having no pride. Now, he’s seeing that Goku has more that he gave him credit for.\n\nLet’s face it, fusion hasn’t worked out at all. Goku first suggested it as a lifeline, but it didn’t make Gotenks strong enough to win. The Potara seemed to make it easier to do, but Gohan still missed his chance. Vegito seemed like a slam dunk, except he didn’t beat Buu either. He let himself be absorbed, and then the fusion unexpectedly wore off.\n\nAnd Buu’s power to absorb others puts a major crimp in the idea of fusing to make stronger fighters. If Buu gets backed into a corner, he’ll absorb you, whether your’re fused or not. At least this way, Goku and Vegeta can fight as themselves, without having to worry about time limits or unexpected malfunctions. And if they lose, at least they get to keep their self-respect.\n\nAnd I think the unspoken respect between these two is based on this: Goku recognizes that Vegeta tried to play things his way. We did fusion, and now we’re here, so we’re gonna try it Vegeta’s way this time. Maybe they’re not friends yet, but this is the best they’ve gotten along, ever.\n\nBack on the Grand Kai Planet, apparently only King Kai, Krillin, and Yamcha seem to have any idea that Majin Buu is in their midst. Pikkon and the others think Buu is just a new arrival at the training ground, except he doesn’t have a halo.\n\nFighting Buu is pointless. He overwhelms everybody, and when Krillin cuts him in half with a Kienzan, Buu just puts himself back together and decks him.\n\nSeeing this in the Elder Kai’s crystal ball, Goku prepares to teleport over there, but Vegeta suggests that they lure Buu to this planet instead. It’s sturdy and nearly deserted, so they can fight freely. All they have to do is raise their power level, and Buu will sense it and come running.\n\nGoku loves that plan, because it solves a problem with yelling, and that’s what this show is all about. Also teamwork and self-improvement, but mostly yelling.\n\nSo Buu’s about to destroy the Grand Kai Planet, and there a line somewhere in this episode about how if Krillin and Yamcha get destroyed after having already being killed, then they’ll just cease to exist. I don’t get that, since Buu can only destroy the bodies they got from King Yemma, right? Wouldn’t they just be reduced to spirits like Bulma and Chi-Chi? Or can Buu kill those as well?\n\nAnyway, in this scene, Kid Buu says one of his few lines in the show. In the dub he says “Buu squash you like bugs!” and then when he senses Goku and Vegeta he laughs and says “Dum-dums!” I always wondered if he could really talk in the subs, but it looks like he did."
