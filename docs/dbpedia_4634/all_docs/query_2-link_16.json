        "text": "It's not an argument for Goku > Gohan at all.\n\nYou can argue that it's not inconsistent with your point because you can speculate how Goku would have done, but to say that it supports your point, even if it is not the sole support for your point, is just not valid.\n\nThere is not any even soft evidence in this scene that's Goku > Gohan.\n\nYes it does support my stance. It's a minor detail that doesn't conflict with my main argument.\n\nAlso this is some mental gymnastics if I've ever seen them.\n\nwhat do you think Goku was going to try to do when Buu was coming at him?\n\nHe was hoping to stall to for potara.\n\nRight he thought he could stall against a foe that could run his son the hands with ease.\n\nwhat do you think that Gohan did when he was faced with Buutenks?\n\nHe also took a fighting stance. (He seemed a lot more willing to fight buu)\n\nNever said Gohan wasn't willing to fight Buutenks... I'm saying even after knowing Gohan got merked by him, Goku was also ready and willing to fight Buutenks.\n\nYou can either accept the text of the manga\n\nOh you mean like the Kai's weakened Kid Buu, yet Buff Buu's ki is stated to be above Super Buu? And we know Buff Buu was a direct result of Buu absorbing a Kai that weakened him.\n\nDo you accept those text of the manga that makes this entire debate completely worthless?\n\nAll I needed to read honestly. From the guy that says troublesome = power, add /= add.\n\nYou can either accept the text of the manga and that Goku isn't strong enough to help Gohan beat Buutenks, or spin.\n\nI'm not saying add=\\=add... I'm saying even if it's a multiplier it's still adding on-top of his original power.\n\nAnd having 2 fighters who equal above the villain when combined, yet can't beat him still has happened before.\n\nKrillin in the Saiyan arc( with a stated powelevel of 1770 in the daizenshuu), destroys 3 saibamen who had power levels of 1200 according to Nappa.\n\nWhich x 3 is 3600 and much greater than Krillins 1770, as it's over 2x his strength.\n\nYet Krillin killed all 3 of them at once.\n\nSo yeah when facing against someone who is greater than the individual characters, but not their combined strength, just adding their 2powers together doesn't cut it.\n\nPiccolo was willing to fight Freeza while Goku readied the Spirit Bomb.\n\nVegeta was willing to fight Kid Buu while Goku readied the Spirit Bomb\n\nThose were with a specific goal to stall for time.\n\nGoku was down to fight Buu to escape from inside of himself.\n\nBig difference.\n\nNothing says he doesn't know about Kid Buu. You provided nothing here to support that idea.\n\nGrey Buu was part of Fat Buu, Fat Buu would know about Kid Buu, ergo, Super Buu knows about Kid Buu.\n\nSimple logic.\n\nWell Super Buu thought he'd turn into grey Buu, when Vegeta brought it up.\n\nThat to me shows he didn't know about Kid Buu. The Kai's also say that his heart changed when he absorbed south and daio Kaioshins... So that to me means there's a good chance they aren't aware of the original.\n\nBut you're claiming by Buutenks saying he's the strongest Buu he would have known about Kid. You have yet to prove that at all. We have no idea if Fat Buu knows about Kid Buu.\n\nNothing says that. All the Z fighter absorbed Buu's considered themselves Majin Buu. Everyone in the story considers all those Buu as Majin Buu.\n\nEither the Old Kai is referencing all Majin Buu or he isn't, and at that point, nothing suggests what that cutoff is. All forms other than Kid Buu are absorption based. Picking and choosing between which is headcanon.\n\nThat's why the line is irrelevant.\n\nIt was specially stated the forms of Buu that weakened him by absorbing the Kai's, right after Kaioshin confirms Kid Buu is the most troublesome... Which means those are the ones being compared to.\n\nBuutenks and Buuhan weren't weakened when they became who they became so the comparison isn't about them.\n\n\"You must be, right?\"\n\nThe story never says Kid Buu is the strongest. Show me that. Also never says Goku is the strongest either. Fate of the universe /= strongest battle. Buuhan and Vegito take that.\n\nKid Buu was weakened by absorbing the Kai's stated.\n\nThe form of Buff Buu who is the result of Kid Buu absorbing a Kai was stated to have larger ki than Super Buu.\n\nI've already mentioned this a few times.\n\nAnd my point isn't fate of the universe = strongest fight .. it's that if there were stronger fighters alive or available when that statement is made, it wouldn't mean anything.\n\nYet the title of the chapter Goku vs Kid Buu fight is called \"a battle with the universe at stake\"\n\nAnd they destroyed the earrings before the fight started so Vegito was out of the question, yet they had made a plan to revive the earthlings before the earrings were destroyed, meaning they are still part of the statement.\n\nDo we know the time frame for when a dead fighter is given his body by Yemma? This would require Yemma to have actually met the person in question, and when everyone is revived by the Dragon Balls, it's clear Gohan doesn't know what's happening.\n\nGohan could've been stuck in the check in line\n\nBut that would be an in-universe answer. Out of universe, Gohan was written out of the story as the main character, and Goku had to win. Toriyama made sure Vegito, Gohan, or Gotenks couldn't go to the fight so only Goku, the new main character, could win.\n\nWhy do you think Goku picks up Satan and not his own kids? Toriyama didn't want them there at all.\n\nIt doesn't matter the timeframe. If he is so much stronger than he would have been restored when he came up in line. And then been brought to beat Buu.\n\nAlso that's only one method as well. As the plan to revive him and everyone else was already made before Buu reached the realm of the Kai's.\n\nOut of universe explanation is that Gohan is a nerd and couldn't never hold the title of strongest when GOATku is around.\n\nAnd Satan was closer to Goku at that time. But the real reason for this is because Satan was with Dende, and Dende is the way of using the dragonballs... That's why our of verse they were written in over the kids.\n\nGenki is only one part of Ki.\n\nGenki (元気 lit. \"Vigor\")\n\nYūki (勇気 lit. \"Courage\")\n\nShōki (正気 lit. \"Right-mindedness\")\n\nWe saw in the Gohan vs Cell fight that when Gohan was not in the right state of mind, he was massively weaker than he should've been and that was just 1/3 of what makes up Ki.\n\nGohan at best can only provide 1/3 of his total ki, but even then, he needs Genki to live, so who knows how much Gohan was giving of his total power. It's unquantifiable.\n\nThis is incorrect as shown by Juub in this thread.\n\nAnd we know that Goku was going to take as much ki from them as he could.\n\nVegeta's first wish could've been for a new set of Potara. Vegeta's plan was also not to bring Gohan to the fight.\n\nThey made the plan to revive and restore the Earth before the Potara were ever destroyed...\n\nAnd yeah Vegetas plan was not to bring in Gohan, because he wouldn't be enough.\n\nGoku does try to shoot down the Spirit Bomb!\n\nIt's only after King Kai says he can communicate with the earth does Goku accept the Spirit Bomb as a great idea, because he's also willing to allow the Earth to save itself. He even calls Vegeta a hero for it.\n\nGoku only shot it down because he wanted to take a little bit of energy from the Earthlings, but Vegeta tells him to take more than a little.\n\nAnd so that means the energy that Gohan and everyone else gave, wasn't just a little bit. It was as much as they could give.\n\nAnd seeing as Gohan beat Super Buu with ease, this means he put more energy into the spirit bomb than he used for Super Buu, and yet it wasn't enough to kill Kid Buu.\n\nGoku has never been drawn to have that expression in the second panel I showed. That was not a serious looking Goku, serious meaning he was ready to fight. That's the face of someone who'd rather not be there.\n\nAnd yet he was there standing his ground ready to fight.\n\nBut Goku was looking serious when he said he'd beat Super Buu inside of Buu.\n\nAlso just off the top of my head Goku has been drawn with goofy looking faces while in a serious fight, like when he bit Kid Buu. But that being drawn differently isn't even really an argument so meh.\n\nEh, Buu was shaking after transforming, not making any moves. Goku had nothing to worry about from his perspective.\n\nWell he was realizing that the transformed. So maybe in that sense he was a little shooken up.\n\nAnd yeah Goku had nothing to worry about because he is stronger than that form of Buu.\n\nGoku never says he could beat Buuiccolo.\n\nIt's disappointing that Goku went through all that heartache only to not be needed. Gohan alone is enough.\n\nHe wasn't pressed at all about about Buu powering down. When he said even Gohan, or Gohan alone can beat you, it means he thinks he's above Gohan and that Gohan is the weakest one among them who can beat Buu.\n\nAlso disappointing that he won't permanently fuse with his son eh? Lol. No he disapointed that Buu became so weak.\n\nYou can't just meh that away. You're refusing to accept the words in front of you.\n\nThis is something you brought up last post, but this isn't a math problem. It's logical thinking.\n\nGohan > Super Buu\n\nSuper Buu ~ Gotenks\n\nSuper Buu + Gotenks > Gohan + Goku\n\nAgain you're assuming there is a straight up 1+1 addition.\n\nAnd as I have shown above, we know a being who is weaker than the first combined, can still easily kill them if he is above their individual powers.\n\nSo yeah either way you're point here is wrong.\n\nUh yeah, Gohan is taking everything Goku throws out. Ultimate GOAThan is eating Goku for breakfast, lunch, and dinner.\n\nUh huh. If you say so.\n\nDespite Kid Buu being stronger than Fat Buu, Fat Buu managed to buy a good amount of time for Goku to do the Spirit Bomb.\n\nFat looked like a helpless baby against Evil Buu.\n\non my head Super Buu>>>>Evil Buu=Kid Buu>>>>>>Fat Buu.\n\nThe clips you showed for Fatso vs Kidd Buu are anime filler. Same with grey dodging multiple punches, in the manga he dodged one punch.\n\nBut yeah, Kid Buu was toying with fatso. He beat him up with his feet similar to Vegito vs Buuhan, and also beat him up with the single arm he severed from his body.\n\nEvil Buu + Fat Buu Fusion who it's Super Buu it's more Stronger than Kid or Evil Buu alone Even Piccolo shit in his pants seeing Super Boo for the First time.\n\nPiccolo freaked out about fighting Shin, him freaking out over the strength of a foe means little.\n\nAlso Goku was dead at this point, so at best it means Super Buu is > the strength he thinks Gotenks is capable of.\n\nBottom line: Goku only admits to being able to Kill Fat Buu and Kid Buu with SSJ3. Didn't kill Fat Buu cause he wanted the next gen to handle it. Secondly SSJ3 could of killed Kid Buu with all it's might gathered up but wasted the power while fighting Buu because he was styling SSJ3's power to Vegeta. So he could not gather all his power in one go due to SSJ3 consuming too much Ki in the land of the living compared to being dead. Also Goku outright says there is only one way they can win against Super Buu and that's with fusion.\n\nSpoiler: spoiler\n\nChapter: 506 (DBZ 312), P12.4-5\n\nContext: after Goku and Vegeta revert Boo back to regular evil Boo\n\nGoku: “Hehhe~~eh! With this, Boo’s power should have fallen significantly! We’re almost there! See, see: the size of his ki is completely different than before!”\n\nVegeta: “Alright! Let’s blast out of here and escape!”\n\nGoku: “Wait! Even though Boo has returned to normal a whole lot, we’re still simply no match for his strength! If we go outside like this, we’ll definitely be done in…!”\n\nChapter: 506 (DBZ 312), P13.1\n\nContext: still talking about how they’re no match for Boo\n\nGoku: “…But there is one way we can win!”\n\nVegeta: “You want to say Fusion, right? Well who cares about that?!”\n\nGoku: “Huh? You know about it?”\n\nVegeta: “I saw it from the afterlife…You’ve got to be joking! You think I’d perform those ugly poses…?! Anyway, I thought I told you that I’m not going to merge with you a second time.”\n\nChapter: 509 (DBZ 315), P11.4-6\n\nContext: as Goku prepares to fight Boo\n\nGoku: “Alrii~~iight. I’d better go all out right from the start…! If we get done in, then the entire universe will go ‘poof’…”\n\nVegeta: “Let me see this ‘Super Saiyan 3’ thing with my own eyes…”\n\nGoku: “Is that alright? You just might not get your turn…I can say this now, but the truth is that with that fat Boo, I would have been able to defeat him at the time with Super Saiyan 3…However, I wanted the young guys to manage something…For the Earth’s sake too…”\n\nChapter: 510 (DBZ 316), P12.4-6\n\nContext: after Goku fights pure Boo for a bit\n\nVegeta: “…Heh…You never intended to switch out, even from the beginning. Don’t spout such transparent lies…You knew…That I’d be killed at once.”\n\nGoku: “Huh!? N-no, that’s not it…”\n\nVegeta: “Hmph…Don’t try sparing my feelings…The truth is you were right [that I’d be killed]. That Boo is stronger than I imagined…And so are you, Kakarot…”\n\nChapter: 510 (DBZ 316), P13.1-6\n\nVegeta: “Don’t hesitate for my sake, and finish him off! With that Super Saiyan 3, you should be able to completely wipe out Boo with your ki once you gather it with all your might…!”\n\nGoku: “Ye…yeah…I’ve been thinking of doing that as well since awhile back, but…I haven’t gotten the chance.”\n\nVegeta: “Eh?”\n\nGoku: “If I want to wipe him out, I gotta gather ki for about one minute.”\n\nVegeta: “One minute?!”\n\nGoku: “Dammnit~~~If it was with the Potara, I could have done it in one blast. …..Cheh~~~I guess I went and showed off too much. But I thought things would go a little better than this…!”\n\nVegeta: “…S …So you weren’t thinking of me…”\n\nChapter: 511 (DBZ 317), P8.3-5, P10.4\n\nContext: as Goku gathers ki, while Vegeta holds off pure Boo\n\nGoku: “Just a little more…….!! Just a little bit more. Tough it out for me, Vegeta….!!”\n\nVegeta: “St…still not yet?...Hurry up…..!! I’ll be ki…..killed………..!!”\n\nGoku: “Sh-shit…! It-it’s already over 1 minute, but…N-not yet! I still can’t wipe out Boo with this much…! [ ] …Da...Damn it……..!! …I haven’t gathered all the ki!! What’s going on? He…he’ll be killed…..!!!”\n\nChapter: 512 (DBZ 318), P1.6\n\nContext: Vegeta asks Goku if he’s gathered enough ki to defeat Boo yet\n\nGoku: “I…I know..! I know, but…It’s strange… I gathered my ki close to full power, but…The ki which I al…already gathered has begun falling off…!”\n\nChapter: 512 (DBZ 318), P10.3-5\n\nContext: still with the ki-charging business\n\nVegeta: “Ka…Kakarot…!! …Cut it out…! How long will it take? Do…do it now…N…not yet? Have you still not gathered the ki...!?”\n\nGoku: “Da…Damn it…Damn it…!! …It shouldn’t be…It shouldn’t be like this…!! My…my power…my power is…Fa…falling off…”\n\n*he reverts from Super Saiyan 3 back into his regular state*\n\nChapter: 513 (DBZ 319), P1.2\n\nContext: after Goku drops out of Super Saiyan 3\n\nGoku: “Da-dammit…When I was dead, it was no problem at all…It seems that in the end, becoming a Super Saiyan 3 with a living body eats up an excessive amount of ki…”"
