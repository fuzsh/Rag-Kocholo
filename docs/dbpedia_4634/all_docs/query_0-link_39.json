        "text": "by IreneBelserion69, Jun 2, 2019, 1:50:18 PM\n\nPersonal Journal\n\n(Due to the internet outage Wednesday, this journal was delayed by several days, this was originally intended to come out before Endgame to address the problems of making Captain Marvel Thanos level both in the comics and within the MCU itself, this would likely be outdated as this update is being written with the release of Endgame, sorry for the inconvenience caused by the internet outage. Inevitably due to inevitable shitty writing, i half expect Captain Marvel to defeat Thanos singlehandedly with no real effort and further piss on the grave of the MCU and look forward to hating the hell out of Endgame, boy that would be fun!\n\nUpdate: Updated the size of the Universe and revised allUniverse calcs due to new numbers in preparation for the Kirby respect thread soon.\n\nAlso redid calcs that used the 1×10^12 muplticaion now that i learned how to do those right, fixed all mathematical errors, will be updating DBZ too\n\nUPDATE: Updated the size of the Muitiverse based on the Muitverse forumala)\n\nBecause you haven’t gotten sick of me bashing Captain Marvel and i love putting this egotistical cunt in her place, we’re going to cover yet another journal on her, this would be my last one on her until the end of Endgame. I’m working on doing a separate journal entirely on her performance on Endgame and look forward to hating every second of her on screen and hating the movie for her ruining it but let’s put this bullshit to rest that she’s the Strongest Avenger in any continuity be it the Marvel Cinematic Universe or in the Comics.\n\nMuch like my “How Strong is Luffy Debunked Journal”, I’ll be using calcs from other sites like VS Battle Wiki, Reddit, Comic Vine and other sites along with making up my own calcs based on presented feats from the movies and comics. Unlike my how strong is Luffy Journal, there is no joy to be had other than putting this cunt in her fucking place and debunking the bullshit narrative pimped out by Marvel that she’s the strongest Marvel/Avenger’s character because let’s be real, she’s honestly fun to hate.\n\nwww.marvel.com/articles/comics…\n\nI briefly covered this bulllshit Social Justice infographic in Part 3 of my Anti Captain Marvel reviews which i basically said all this.\n\nwww.fandom.com/articles/captai…\n\nWhereas Marvel going by this fourm here literally is stated to have up 418,000,000,000,000 joules or a measly 99.904 Kilotons of TNT\n\nWhile much of the above is speculative when it comes to how things will play out in Avengers: Endgame, we do know that Captain Marvel is pretty much unbeatable when it comes to hand-to-hand combat. As well as being super strong, super durable, immune to toxins and possessing the ability to fly, she can also emit really powerful photon blasts from her body. In Captain Marvel, we see her slice a spaceship in two, and that Marvel infographic tells us she gives out 418,000,000,000,000 joules in one energy blast. Compared with Black Panther’s 37,500.\n\n99 Kilotons look like this on the map.\n\nSo yes going by the Marvel Infographic trying to wank Captain Marvel, she only has 99.04 Kilotons of TNT. Not to shabby right, after all the MCU is far weaker than the comics and having Town level attack potency isn’t too shabby.\n\nThor’s feat of busting Skovoda\n\nvsbattles.fandom.com/wiki/User…\n\nThere is actually an exact value in the movie. FRIDAY says Sokovia’s diametre is 6410 feet/1953.768 m.\n\nOriginal calc.\n\nFirst, volume of Sokovia. Assuming it’s a hemisphere, like Gwynbleiddd did so, then multiply by the density, 2800, we get the mass.\n\nSo according to Gwynbleiddd’s scaling, the debris travelled at 532 px/s.\n\nSokovia is 1143 px, so the debris is (532/1143*1953.768).\n\n(2/3*pi*1953.768^3*2800)*((532/1143*1953.768)^2)*0.5 = 1.8083496816778625961e+19, just barely Island level\n\nEDIT: A better image of the Sokovia’s diametreForgot to divide the diametre in two. That should be 976.884 m.\n\nAll values taken to 2 decimals cuz I’m lazy.\n\nHowever, analyzing on watchframebyframe, it took around 0.93 seconds, not 1 full second. The speed is:\n\n(532/1143*1953.768)/0.93 = 977.81\n\nMass:\n\n2/3*pi*976.884^3*2800 = 5.47e12\n\n5.47e+12*977.81^2*0.5 = 2.61e+18 Joules, just barely Mountain level+\n\nNot bad, he can fight Cole.\n\nSo Thor going by this feat is 4.322 Gigatons of TNT which is Large Mountain level+. This would make Thor going by this feat over 43,740 times more powerful than MCU Captain Marvel going by Marvel’s own Infographic, most powerful Avenger my fucking ass.\n\nThen you have this fight from Surtur\n\nIntroduction\n\nThis is actually a redux of an old calculation originally done by Darkanine all credit to pixel scaling and mass calculation goes to him.\n\nAn error in the math occurred, so I’ll fix that up real quick.\n\nThe Calculation\n\nSo the new calc still uses the same mass, but with a new timeframe and distance, resulting in new speed. The changes to the math are simple.\n\n885 divided into 135 is not 68.07, it is 6.556. So this will be an entire magnitude downgrade.\n\n6.556*1414.356 = 9272.518 meters.\n\n2:49.98-2:50.67 = 0.69 seconds\n\nSpeed: 13438.432 m/s\n\nArgard: 2.7551033×10^13 kg, as found by Darkanine\n\nKE: 0.5*(2.7551033×10^13)*13438.432^2 = 2.4877406×10^21 joules, or 594.584 Gigatons of TNT, High 6-C, Large Island level+\n\nFinal Tally\n\nDestroying Asgard: 2.4877406×10^21 joules, or 594.584 Gigatons of TNT, High 6-C, Large Island level+\n\nThe Hulk is easily on this level of power considering Thor feared the Hulk could kill Surtur and Hulk actually caused the behemoth to flinch. That would make both Post Skaar Hulk, Thor and Surtur all over 6 Million times more powerful than MCU Captain Marvel going by the Infographic. Yeah Marvel, you really suck at wanking your Mary Sue female lead.\n\nYeah not looking good for Captain Marvel and we haven’t even gotten to Thanos in the MCU.\n\nThe same Thor and Hulk effortlessly boiled by base Thanos who literally bodied both of them for the fun of it.

Thanos attack Potency is 11 Quadrillion Megatons of TNT, Captain Marvel is barely 1/10th a Megaton of TNT, that makes Captain Marvel over 110 Quadrillion times weaker than Thanos, that’s the difference in power.\n\nAnd once again not even going by powerscaling to Ronan the Accuser who can desotry a whole planet and that’s merely weilding one of the stones.\n\nvsbattles.fandom.com/wiki/User…\n\nRonan the Accuser literally wields an Orb that casually lifewiped a whole planet, a feat going by scaling is worth roughly 2.1863518e+37 joules, or 5.22550621415 ninatons (Large Planet level). To break this down in sheer numbers, that’s way stronger than Megaton level nukes. I know to go by how Captain Marvel is scaled in the comics, she’s much higher than merely Town level+ and I’m being a dick downplaying her but I’m not the one who put out infographics claiming she can beat Thanos yet have her qaunaitfably below Thanos by calcs even by MCU standards.\n\nAnd that’s not even taking forth his massive feat in the Marvel Cinematic Universe.\n\nThanos Finger snaps the Universe.\n\nSo an average adult human has a volume around 75 l, or 75,000 cubic centimeters.\n\nHuman denisty:1.01 g/cc\n\nSubatomic Destruction: Applied only if clearly stated.

The Skrulls were pussies as well as the fucking Kree, fuck the Red Ribbon Army was more a threat than the Skurlls or Kree despite being far inferior technology wise. Goku could defeat the fucking Skrulls with ease as a Kid, am i supposed to be impressed by less impressive feats than Kid Goku?\n\nHell, i doubt she could even beat Staff Officer Black given her lack of any impressive feats. This is why it pays off to actually BUILD UP YOU FUCKING VILLAINS.\n\nGoing back to WonderWoman yet again, Daina fought against normal humans sure but the god Areas as shown to be a supernatural threat who pushed Wonder Woman to her Limits, we actually see her and how powerful she can be, generating storms and killing him with her power, this is something that’s built up lore-wise.\n\nCaptain Marvel, by contrast, has no fucking lore build up about her powers, no weight, nothing. Of course expect her to single-handedly beat Thanos via bad writing, contrived plot devices and having to nerf Hulk and Thor just to make her look good.\n\nNow onto Captain Marvel in the comics, surely she is the most powerful Avenger in the comics, right?\n\nAs established before, she’s only consistently shown to be Solar System Level+ within the Comics at best. That’s only Base Thor level or base Hulk level. Even with her highest end feat which was absorbing a Blackhole, it’s still only Solar System level+, Thor and Hulk have shown far more impressive and much higher feats as Thor has occasionally battled High Skyfather to Low Celestial Tier characters while Hulk has battled Sentry and Doctor Strange who are casually above Solar System level.\n\nContrast this with a full power bloodlusted Thor who’s able to crack the Armor of Celestials, beings which are consistently depicted as extremely casual Universe Busters and superior to Skyfather tier and Cosmic Cube level characters.\n\nAnd able to knock back a fully fed Galactus who can literally desotry entire Universes with ease.\n\nThor is also shown moving the mass of the entire World Tree which is depicted to have the mass of at least a Small Multiverse.\n\nAs each of the Nine Realms of the God Tree is depicted to be at least Universe Size each with their own dimensional spaces of time as well.\n\nEssentially Thor’s full power is easily comparable to Zeno from Dragon Ball, easily in the Low Multiverse to Multiversal tier which is immeasurably far stronger than Captain Marvel within the comics.\n\nand this is not even factoring Rune King Thor who surpasses Odin.\n\nThe same Odin who can casually create Muitlversial shockwaves against Seth which can casually level galaxies and be felt across the entire Marvel Multiverse.\n\nA Multiverse with at least 47,385,383 known dimensional realities going by the Marvel Database wiki which would be shaking 47 Million Universes at once with each of them having separate Mircoverses, Space timeline relates and too much to even count. That’s how powerful Odin is and Thor surpasses that.\n\nLet’s do some Math for this one. One Universe is at least 93 Billion Light Year Long or roughly 870 Yottameters, that is 1×10^24 Meters wide with a mass of over 6×10^52 kg or 52 zeros and this is merely the size of the obsverable Universe.\n\nwww.space.com/24073-how-big-is…\n\nInstead of taking one measurement method, a team of scientists led by Mihran Vardanyan at the University of Oxford did a statistical analysis of all of the results. By using Bayesian model averaging, which focuses on how likely a model is to be correct given the data, rather than asking how well the model itself fits the data. They found that the universe is at least 250 times larger than the observable universe, or at least 7 trillion light-years across.\n\nGoing by the Sicnfetic models, we got two sizes of the actual Universe size, 7 Trillion Light Years that can be used for the Low End and 23.25 Trillion Light Years as a high end.\n\nNow let’s take into account the Roache Limit to separate the Universes. That’s between 25 to 30 times the length of the celestial object. So let’s go with the 25 times for Roach Limit.\n\nThis means that we got a High-End Distance between the Universes between 175 Trillion Light Years and 581.25 Trillion Light Years which is thousands of times the length of our Observable Universe.\n\nTo comprehend the sheer scale of this, i came up with a new term exclusive to determining Universe and Multiversal tier feats known as UniFoe.\n\nvsbattles.fandom.com/wiki/User…\n\nUniFoe is essentially the Mass Energy of the Universe exploding eqauilvent to that of the Big Bang which would be 2.825 TenaexaFoe or 2.825×10^92 Joules, this would be helpful in determining just how much force is needed to shake the entirely of the massive Marvel Multiverse with casual blows.\n\nweb.archive.org/web/2018121215…\n\nkey for the term i invented.\n\nUniFoe=10^92 J to 10^95 J\n\nKiloUniFoe=1,000 fold\n\nMegaUniFoe=1,000,000 fold\n\nGigaUniFoe=1 Billion Fold\n\nTeraUniFoe=1 Trillion Fold\n\nPetaUniFoe= 1 Quadrillion fold\n\nExaUnifoe= 1 Quntillion fold\n\nZetaUniFoe= 1 Sextillion fold\n\nYotta UniFoe=1 Septrillion fold\n\nNinaUniFoe=1 Octillion fold\n\nTenaUnFoe=10^30 fold\n\nTenaKiloUniFoe=10^33 fold\n\nTenaMegaUniFoe=10^36 fold\n\nTenaGigaUniFoe=10^39 fold\n\nTenaTeraUniFoe=10^42 fold\n\nTenaPetaUniFoe=10^45 fold\n\nTenaExaUniFoe=10^48 fold\n\nTenaZettaUniFoe=10^51 fold\n\nTenaYottaUniFoe=10^54 fold\n\nTenaNinaUniFoe=10^57 fold\n\nBiTenaUniFoe=10^60 Fold\n\nBiTenaKiloUniFoe=10^63 fold\n\nAssuming the Multiverse is at least the length of 47,385,383 Universe size entities and mupiltying that by the Roache Limit of each Universe, the Marvel Multiverse would be roughly 2.754275386875e+22 Lightyears across or 27.54 Sextillion Lightyears across which is beyond incomprehensible amounts of size.\n\nThe real size of the Marvel Multiverse should be the size of the Multiverse in Multiverse theory.\n\nThe Multiverse is very huge. Our Local Multiverse has approximately 10^10^10^120 universes, although a multiverse can contain anywhere from only 2 universes to omega universes. Our universe lasts long, most of them only live for xonoseconds and pop. The diameter of the Local Multiverse is on the order of 92,200,000,000 * 10^10^10^120 light years across! A multiverse is a self-contained group or larger bubble filled with a finite or infinite number of universes. In many cases, the term is used to define a larger bubble filled with a finite or infinite number of universes. In many cases, the term is used to define the hypothetical set of every single possible universe, including the universe in which we live.\n\nNow to sum up this mind-blowing number, the a real Mutivlerse is 9.3e+120,000 lightyears across, a mind-blowingly large size beyond comprehension.\n\nwww.space.com/34928-the-univer…\n\nwww.space.com/24073-how-big-is…\n\nLet’s also assume the cubic size of the Universe for density and give each 92 Billion Lightyears the same density of our Universal plane. It should be well noted that current scinfetifc models believe that the Universe is flat meaning the Universe would be disk shaped like a galaxy.\n\nen.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milky_Wa…\n\nThe entire stellar disk of our galaxy is estimated to have a diameter of 100,000 light-years. The thickness of the Milky Way Galaxy is considered to be approximately 1,000 light-years.\n\nGoing by this formula, the size of our Universe should be 23.5 Trillion Light Years Wide and Long and having a thickness of at least 235 Billion Lightyears giving it the volume of 1.083314312985248e+88 m^3 or 1.14506413233621e+72 Cubic Lightyears\n\nContrast this with the Observable Universe which is 93 Billion Light Years in diameter and has a volume of 4×10^80 m^3 or 4.228008489853763e+64 Cubic Lightyears which is 27,082,879 timers smaller than the volume of the actual size of the Universe, you can fit roughly 27 Million Observable Universes inside the Diameter of the Actual Universe. That means the weight of the actual Universe is roughly 1.62×10^60 kg\n\nThe Marvel Universe is going with the round Universe theory meaning each universe is much thicker than our own universe.It should be noted that each of the 47,385,383 Universe size entities are actually Multiverses.\n\nMenang the Multiverse as a whole weighs a total of 1e+88,141,824 kg.\n\n.\n\nThe difference in size between our Universe and the Marvel Multiverse is the size difference comparable between a volleyball and the Milky Way Galaxy, yeah that’s how vast the Marvel Multiverse is and this is based only on what is known so far, the actual Marvel Multiverse is likely much bigger\n\nGoing by string theory(Which Marvel directly goes by going by the Avengers Endgame movie alone)\n\nThe density of the 11 Dimmeisonal Marvel Multiverse. Menang the Multiverse as a whole weighs a total of 1e+88,141,824 kg.\n\n1,000,000,000,000,000\n\nNow for the energy of the collision itself which could instantaneous cover the entire Multiverse. This would be far faster than anything calced.\n\nThis makes even Goku’s mighty clash with Beerus appear to be a slow motion to Odin and Seth.\n\nwww.convertunits.com/from/mete…\n\n149,597,870,690.99997 meters=1 AU\n\nwww.convertunits.com/from/ligh…\n\n63241.077088071 AU’s= One Light Year\n\n93.7 billion light years – The diameter of the observable universe;\n\nSize of the DB Universe: 23.25 Trillion Light Years or 2.199620631786262e+29 meters\n\nDB Universe Volume:2.340944612800386e+117 m^3 or 2.478298321316967e+101 Cubic Light Years(2.160909889900313e+29 or 216.09 Octillion times larger than our Universe)\n\nDB Universe mass:1.39654×81 kg\n\nThe speed of Goku and Beerus punch:8.864704452808217e+26 m/s\n\nLight travels at 299,792,458 m/s\n\n5.496684396914271e+30 m/s or 1.833496557446509e+22 c /18.33 Sextillion times the speed of light\n\nE=MxC^2/2\n\nE=1.39654×10^81kgx 5.496684396914271e+30 m/s^2/2\n\nE= 1.39654×10^81kx3.021353935928079e+61 m/2\n\nE=4.219441625680999x10e+142 Joules\n\n4.219441625680999e+142 joule = 1.0084707518e+127 megaton [explosive] or 100.847 TenaexaUniFoe\n\nGoku and Beerus Clash:100.847 TenaexaUniFoe(Universe Level+)\n\nNow for sheer length speed of the Marvel Multiverse, the Marvel Multiverse would be roughly 92,200,000,000 * 10^10^10^120 light years across! which is beyond incomprehensible amounts of size.\n\nGoing by the math here, to instantaneously punch an infinite Muiltverisal reality like the Marvel or DC Universe would require an attack speed impossible to achieve in reality as the predicted age of the Universe is only 100 trillion years. I take back what i said about Zeno Level, this shits on even Zeno’s casual Universe busting feat.\n\nAnd mind you this is merely a conservative estimate of the Marvel Multiverse size, in reality, the Marvel Multiverse is said to actually be a Hyperverse or an Omniverse with Muitverses within Multiverses and this feat really only tackles the masses of 3 Dimensional objects, Marvel is confirmed to have an Omniverse that has over 32 Dimensions which makes scaling the verse vritually incomprehensible if not completely infinite dimmesionsals,Odin’s feat with Seth is the closest one can get to conventional scaling as calling these feats to become immeasurable past this point. We’re going to settle with merely the 11 Dimensional scale used by String theory as the minimum force.\n\nGBE of the Entire 11 Dimmeisonal Marvel Mutiverse: 1.985832917233346e+44,070,912 J Joules ( High Complex Multiverse Level+)\n\nTo contrast with Dragonball again, Beerus and Goku punching the Universe and shaking it with the mass-energy of the Universe times 5.496684396914271e+30 m/s or 1.833496557446509e+22 c /18.33 Sextillion times the speed of light produced only 100.847 TenaexaUniFoe(Universe Level+)\n\nIt’s safe to say that Thor is arguably the most powerful of the Avengers bar none. He’s beaten the Hulk more times than lost to him.\n\nEven Stan Lee himself basically states that out of all Avengers. So yeah Captain Marvel stronger than Odinforce Thor or Rune King Thor?HAHAHAHAHAHA, YEAH NO!\n\nGoing by the comics, her strongest form Binary at beast can absorb a Black Hole which isn’t a bad feat at all however even if we scale the absorption speed of the black hole with her own Massively FTL speed, it would still be nowhere close to matching even Odinforce Thor much less a full powered Thor that surpasses Odin but let’s try anyway.\n\nLet’s take into account as Binary she was said to be faster and stronger than Quasar who can fly across the Universe in seconds, essentially giving Binary’s speed up to 2.956 Qunttilion Times the Speed of Light putting her within the range of speeds expected from Late Buu Saga/Early DBS Z fighters.\n\nvsbattles.fandom.com/wiki/User…\n\nIf we have a character like Captain Marvel eating 81% of a black hole in 10 seconds. If we go by this calc here we get varying powers with it ranging to Dwarf Star to Solar System level but to throw Captain Marvel a bone, let’s measure the mass moving at 2.956 Qunttilion Times the Speed of Light just because I’m a generous bastard who gives bones. Let’s assume the feat is a 2.04812E+32 kg in mass and mupily that by 81 %, that’s a mass of over 1.658961E+32 kg, The speed of Captain Marvel is at least 8.864704452808217e+26 m/s scaling from Quasar like i said I’m being highly generous to Captain Marvel here.\n\nE=MxC^2/2\n\nE= 1.658961E+32 kgx8.864704452808217e+26 m/s^2\n\nE=1.658961E+32 kgx7.858298503563783e+53/2\n\nE=6.51830537188534e+85 Joules\n\n6.51830537188534e+85 joule = 1.5579123738e+70 megaton [explosive]\n\nThat’s not too bad, to be frank, it’s at least Multi Galaxy Level at best for Binary Danvers at her absolute strongest, the problem is that it comes nowhere near close to Thor at his strongest and this is massively Highballing Carol Danvers power level. Thor scales to Odin at his best with Odin Force and surpasses Odin as the Rune King who has a 1.741105116668646×10^25,476 J feat, Danvers comes nowhere even close to surpassing Thor or Odin. Hell Thor is at least\n\nYet due to Marvel’s Social Justice agenda pushing, the MCU Captain Marvel is literary shown to be on par with Thor within the Trailer.\n\nDespite this being the same Thor who achieved Odin Force and uses the Stormbreaker which is stronger than Minjor because fuck actually earning credibility or skill, all you need is to have the plot literally bend to your will and give you power via the Infinity Stone and you easily equal Thor for no credible reason.\n\nDo you know who doesn’t need bullshit bad writing to equal or outmatch Thor? Wonder Woman.\n\nShe literally has the strongest known metal in the entire Omniverse known as Amazonianum which is literally made from Zeus’s shield.\n\nThe same Zeus who defeated the Shatter God whose power equals the Big Bang in a Multiverse confirmed to have 52 Universes easily 1,000 times larger than our Universe so it’s really the Big Ban on Steriods.\n\nNo literally, there’s no ficitonal verse as big as merely one DC Universe.\n\nYeah, Wonder Woman’s bracelets are stronger than the Big Bang’s energy as she was able to absorb Zeus’s power which is casual Universe level and deflect them back.\n\nMind you Zeus is the DC eqauilvent to Odin, a man who can knock out Galactus at full power and was said to equal the Celestials\n\nNot to mention she matched Superman’s attack speed and power.\n\nThe speed of Superman is so fast he can literally travel across the entire galaxy in minutes and repair a whole city within a nanosecond which is a consistent 14.917 Quintillion C.\n\nWhich is faster than Goku and Beerus casual Universal shockwave that’s 2.956 Qunttilion Times the Speed of Light, yeah Superman rebuilding one city is .\n\nAnd who’s Heatvision’s potency was said to easily surpass any known star in the Universe.\n\nWonder Woman and Superman were both bloodlusted in the fight and were fighting to kill each other so they were at full power here\n\nCritical Reflection:Goku vs Post Crisi Superman 1\n\nCritical Relfection:Goku vs Post Crsis Superman 1\n\nRevising several feats within this Death Battle based on a few new feats i found for Post Crisis Superman.

Trust me when i say that Goku stands even less of a chance with these feats i’ve digged up.\n\nSuperman’s feats ( Updated)\n\nDestructive Capacity/Attack Potency\n\nLow End Feats\n\nHe can have a massive AoE, he is also outputting energy rivaling the sun.\n\nHe can\n\nWhich going by this calc in this journal has a force up to 882.9 TenaYotta Foe which is 312,530,970 times the energy of the Big Bang, ablet the repairing reality with that vision is often regarded as an outlier, even so, his Heat vision is usually within the attack potency of 907.537 Peta Foe to 2.096 Yotta Foe which is between Multi Solar System level+ and Galaxy level+ and this is within the baseline power levels of Superman and Wonder Woman, no Pre Crisis counterparts and no power increases like Golden Superman or Wonder Woman with God Wave.\n\nHell Wonderwoman would be at least Solar System level in her default base strength in most versions scaling merely by Superman’s standards and could reach up to Multiversal power levels with channeling in her Godwave powers and can defect trillions of God Shard s from the Universe crossing the distance of the Universe in seconds, this literally shits on any feat Carl Manvers has ever shown. Come back to me when Carl Manvers can actually defeat Ares who is a High Muitlverisal being comparable to Darkseid single-handedly. In fact, i should do a Thor vs Wonderwoman.\n\nSorry went on another tangent on Wonder Woman again, just needed a reminder on how to do a strong female character right. Seriously Wonder Woman is what happens when you give true character development and good writing to a legacy character who stands the test of time and actually create an icon. Captain Marvel, on the other hand, is an end result of a character that was literally handed everything to her on a silver platter and never had to earn anything she achieved like all typical Mary Sue characters.\n\nWhat about Hulk? Surely she’s a lot more powerful than Hulk right? Wrong, Hulk is consistently shown to be on par with Thor, hell most of their clashes are stalemates or noncontests and while Thor is more powerful overall to the Hulk, the Hulk is no slouch and contended with various forms of Thor.\n\nTher’es even the immensely powerful World Breaker Hulk who can defeat even the likes of Doctor Strange.\n\nA ridiculously overpowered character who battles Odin level characters regularly who as we have shown has over 88 MillionZeros worth of Joules, which to say shits on ltierally everything Captain Marvel has done in the comics.\n\nHell, even in Infinity War, Doctor Strange put up the best challenge to Thanos which seems consistent with the comics despite Thanos having most of the Infinity Stones and this is a considerably weaker Universe version of Thanos and the Marvel Multiverse.\n\nSo yeah World Breaker Hulk is Multiversal level by powerscaling as a Strange needed to go beyond his normal powers to keep up with Doctor Strange.\n\nAnd there’s even a far more powerful version of this Hulk known as Space Hulk who’s even more overpowered who’s able to kill 6 Watchers effortlessly who should equal Odin(the strongest Skyfather tier character), this video goes more into detail of Hulks power but before we get into that let’s cover the tier list of Marvel.\n\nwww.outskirtsbattledomewiki.co…\n\nLow Street Level: Peak Human to higher end Street Level destructive capacity and peak human speed with no incredibly powerful weaponry.\n\nMid Street Level: Wall Level destructive capacity and superhuman speed/reactions. Often has lots of weaponry.\n\nHigh Street Level: Small Building Level/Room Level destructive capacity and supersonic speed/reactions. Often has incredibly powerful and very dangerous weaponry.\n\nLow Meta Level: Building Level to Large Building Level destructive capacity and hypersonic speed/reactions. E.g. Wolverine and Deadpool\n\nMid Meta Level: Multi-City Block Level to City Level destructive capacity and hypersonic speed and Massively Hypersonic+ reactions.\n\nHigh Meta-Level: Small Island to Planet level destructive capacity and speed/reactions that go from Massively Hypersonic+ to FTL.\n\nLow Herald Level: Planet Level+ to Star Level destructive capacity and speed/reactions that are FTL to Massively FTL. Low Herald Level beings often have rather potent superpowers and abilities, and can usually survive in space.\n\nMid-Herald Level: Star Level+ to Solar System Level destructive capacity and speeds or reactions that are Massively FTL+. Mid-Herald Level beings often have a wide range of largely potent superpowers, such as energy manipulation, matter manipulation, and transmutation, and can usually survive in space.\n\nHigh Herald Level: Solar System Level+ to Multi Solar System Level destructive capacity and speed or reactions that are Massively FTL+. High Herald Level beings often have minor reality warping or a broken superpower that only beings higher on this list can overcome, along with a large arsenal of highly varied powers.\n\nLow Skyfather Level: Multi-Solar System Level+ to Small Galaxy Level destructive capacity and speed or reactions that are Massively FTL+. Low Skyfather Level beings often have Planet Level to Multi-Solar System Level reality warping, a highly varied array of potent abilities, and can create life, along with other superpowers.\n\nMid Skyfather Level: Galaxy Level to Large Galaxy Level destructive capacity and speed or reactions that are Massively FTL+. Mid Skyfather Level beings are often capable of spacetime manipulation, quantum manipulation, Multi-Solar System Level+ to Galaxy Level reality warping, psychic powers of at least planetary scale, dimension creation and destruction, and other abilities of high potency.\n\nHigh Skyfather Level: Multi-Galaxy Level to Low Multiversal Level destructive capacity and speed or reactions that are Massively FTL+. High Skyfather Level beings can often manipulate or break causality and create effects that can span entire universes, along with Large Galaxy Level to Universe Level reality warping, high tier energy and matter manipulation, and the ability to imbue beings with portions of their power.\n\nCelestial Level: Multiverse level destructive capacity and Massively FTL+ speed or reactions to omnipresence limited to a universe. Celestial Level beings often embody multiple levels, degrees, ordinals, or cardinals of infinity, and can casually create effects that can span multiverses, are able to tank Universe Level attacks and abilities in stride, and have Multiverse Level reality warping.\n\nAbstract Level: High Multiverse Level+ to High Complex destructive capacity and omnipresence limited to a universe up to a multiverse. Abstract Level beings often have concept manipulation, conceptual embodiment, Multiverse Level+ abilities and reality warping, immense versatility in all attributes, universal to Multiverse scale nigh-omniscience, and the ability to create Celestial Level entities.\n\nMulti-Eternity Level: Omniverse Level destructive capacity and omnipresence throughout an Omniverse. Multi-Eternity Level beings often have Omniverse Level reality warping abilities and Omniversal scale nigh-omniscience\n\nSupreme Being Level: Omniverse Level+ destructive capacity and omnipresence. Supreme Being Level entities often have (in-universe) true omnipotence and true omniscience.\n\nThe Watchers are each Cosmic Cubes which are High Skyfather level to Low Celestial Level and Hulk effortlessly killed them with singular attacks, while Watchers are not combatants, they’re each at least Universe level causally by surviving the Big Bang and are comparable to Celestials they’ve been at war with who even a full power Odin could barely scratch so we’re talking at less casual Multiversal Watchers. Meaning Space Hulk could casually one shot Zeno and solo the Dragonball Multiverse whereas Planet Hulk would be at best equal to between Jiren Tier and Zeno tier. Either way, Captain Marvel isn’t touching him.\n\nWhat about Ironman? Cleary in the comics he can’t touch someone like her? Well no.\n\nIronman has developed suits that can match a bloodlusted Hulk and Thor, he’s even developed an armor meant to battle the likes of Thanos and Galactus known as the Ziran Armor, the most powerful Armor to date.\n\nironman.fandom.com/wiki/Ziran_…\n\nVast Cosmic Powers with no known upper limit. Armor able to withstand planet shattering impacts with ease and Armour able to withstand strikes from nuclear warheads. Not the most powerful Celestials could disrupt the solar system from their seats. A single host has the power to threaten all the pantheons of gods in a planet. In fact, a single Celestial possesses the power to withstand attacks from three Skyfathers at the same time completely unfazed (including Odin (Odin in his battle with Seth, they could destroy the entire universe, as well as their battle tore the fabric of the multiverse itself and also hases Odinforce (Odinforce – Also known as one source. A huge number of mystical energy, which manages the King of Asgard, and makes it essentially equal and stronger creatures such as Hela, Dormammu, Mephisto. One can subjugate matter, energy, space and time. Able to teleport himself and all mankind in alternate realities. In his hand could fit the whole galaxy. Even a part of his nature is capable of only one physical power to destroy the planet, like pebbles. If the dark side of Odin (part of the forces of the present one) was given to develop further, he would have crushed the universe. He easily won annihilus who decided to capture the Asgard. One himself said that he could compete with Galactus fed, while the hungry he is able to win without problems. Power Odinforsa so great, that even being in a very weakened state, his battle with Seth (Egyptian god) went around all the levels of being extinguished stars, galaxies and destroyed staggered fabric of the Multiverse itself. and also Odinsword (Sword of Odin, about which we know that if he pulled out of the sheath, the universe was going to end. ) and Zeus). Though not a feat of raw power but of durability, it still suggests that a Celestial is far more powerful than a Skyfather. Durning a Fight With celestial known as Arishem the Judge combined power of Odin, Zeus and Vishnu, did not even scratch it, Odinsvord sword which can impose the most powerful cosmic curse, and who can break the fabric itself of Infinity, and which pierced Arishem, did not hurt him. also Celestials Can Easely Destroy Multiverse and easely withstand attacks which are capable of Easely Destroing Multiverse also they even noot need to fight (Even mighty cosmic abstraction themselves “Suicide themselves ” on his arm) Tony stark in Ziran Armor was Capable of Fighting With Thanos who Had Infinity Gaunflet and even make him feel his attacks. also Celestials Able to create universes at will, share them on the Multiverses.\n\nSo yeah Ironman by all intents and purposes with this armor puts even Batman’s prep skills to shame as he can go from the average joe to punching the crap out of Galactus and Odin tier threats in a nanosecond. Ironman with Prep would slaughter all 12 Universes of Dragonball singlehandedly with this armor, Captain Marvel’s Binary at best Super Sayain God Goku with Highballing, she gets brutally stomped by this Ironman.\n\nOnly due to the horrible writing of SJW current year marvel did she beat Ironman who has prepped and defeated far more powerful opponents than Captain Marvel was ever shown being. So arguably Captain Marvel isn’t even stronger than prepped Tony Stark.\n\nHell, she’s not even the strongest female Avenger, people tend to ignore the Scarlet Witch herself is an Avenger and she’s often depicted as being within Doctor Strange’s level. She’s consistently shown to be an actual badass in the comics. Hell if anything one of the most crowning achievements of badassery or power was how she wrapped reality within an Universal scale. She was claimed to have likely wiped out all mutants in the “omniverse” which is MCU Thanos feat on steroids. Meaning she can essentially Lifewipe the entire Ominvierse potentially.\n\nSo an average adult human has a volume around 75 l, or 75,000 cubic centimeters.\n\nHuman density:1.01 g/cc\n\nSubatomic Destruction: Applied only if clearly stated. It describes the energy necessary to destroy all atoms in a substance, by separating the particles in their nucleus. Note that Protons and Neutrons still stay intact. Value is 5.403E13 (j/cc).\n\n4 092 772 500 000 000 000 joule = 978.196 104 21 megaton [explosive]\n\nThe energy needed to destroy a human body on a Sub Atomic level:978.196 104 21 megaton (Mountain Level+)\n\n7.5 Billion people/2= 3,750,000,000×4 092 772 500 000 000 000 joule\n\n1.5347896875e+28 joule = 3 668 235 390 800 megaton [explosive]\n\nYield needed to kill half of humanity on a subatomic level: 3.668 Exatons of TNT(Multi Continent level+)\n\nOne Inhabitable planet pre-Solar System\n\n200 Billion Earth-like planets in our Galaxy\n\n3.069579375e+39 joule = 7.3364707815e+23 megaton [explosive]\n\nThe energy needed to wipe out our Galaxy of life: 733.647 Ninatons of TNT(Dwarf Star Level+)\n\nAt least I trillion Galaxies in our Universe.\n\n3.069579375e+51 joule = 7.3364707815e+35 megaton [explosive] or 73.336 MegaFoe (Solar System +)\n\nNow mupilty this by over 10^10^10^120 times and mupilty that by dimmesions\n\nNow Multiply that by Dimensions. Here’s how dimension tiering works.\n\nIn 4 dimensions we, for example, would add an additional direction of extension beyond length, width and height. In this fourth direction the extend of a cube would be 0, so its 4 dimensional size, which would be height x length x width x fourth direction would always equal 0.\n\nMarvel has between 16 Dimensional characters. Meaning we have to scale the Marvel Multiverse size and mupilty it by 16 times over.This is beyond incomprehensible.\n\nThis would be like comparing the size of an atom to that of the size of Super Tengan Gurren Larragn, that’s the size difference between the Multiverse and the much larger Hyperverisal/Universal space between dimensions.\n\nBut let’s go with the sheer measure scale of over 15 zeros to 521 zeros. This would make the Scarlet Witch beyond mere Universe Level. The gap between Muitl Solar System level and Universe level is merely 1.6773611764e+34 times, going by Seth and Odin’s feat which was merely one Muitlversial space, with over 16-dimensional spaces of the size as shown, now let’s multiply this all this by 16 dimensions.\n\nThe Scarlet Witch going by the highest possible scaling i can measure can output at least 61.985832917233346e‭+2.366039071811174e+16‬ Joules of energy at once. This is enough to desotry an entire Muitlversial plane with an instantaneous explosion that would destroy time space. Even lowballing the mutant population by just 1% of the human population which is more realistic, Captain Marvel comes not even remotely close to matching the Scarlet Witch.\n\nThe same person who could one shot people using 1/5th the power of the Phoenix Force, a god-like force said to easily be Multiversal in scale so GTFO with this bullshit that Captain Marvel is the strongest avenger, that tile goes to the Scarlet Witch who can one shot Namor, already a powerful villain of his own right amped with the Phoenix Force.\n\nWhich when used by Jean Grey can casually rewrite Universes Zeno style\n\nThere’s also Vakryle within the MCU itself who should be comparable to Thor and Hulk within Thor Ragnarok who wields the Dragon Fang, she’s consistently shown in the comics to be comparable to Thor and easily stronger than Captain Marvel so clearly Vakryle alone debunks the claim that Captain Marvel is the strongest avenger.\n\nHell you got fucking Sentry who’s easily a casual Solar System buster who is said to have the power of 1,000,000 Suns.\n\nWho while shurken at a subatomic level could easily desotry a whole planet and that’s him holding back. A subatomic particle is at least 1×10^-24 1 yoctometre (ym) which is one Septillion times smaller than a normal human. If Sentry could desotry the Earth at 1 Septillion his base power and the mere destruction of the of a planet only needs 53.7Zettatons of TNT to destroy, mupiltying that by 1 Septillion and we get at least 5 PetaFoe of energy from Sentry’s base form making her at least Multi Solar System level in base, likely far stronger.\n\nHowever, the best feat from Sentry was being able to beat World War Hulk who we established is far more powerful than base Doctor Strange and forced Strange to channel Hulks rage to stand a chance.\n\nNow for the real Nigga Thanos, now that I outlined the problem of making Captain Marvel the strongest avenger not outlined anywhere in the comics and not being as strong as Thor or Hulk. Can she Beat Thanos, no, even without the Infinity Gauntlet?\n\nThanos could body Herald tier characters with ease without the infinity gauntlet.\n\ncomicvine.gamespot.com/carol-d…\n\nThis is not to say Captain Marvel isn’t a powerful Superhero, She’s consistently shown to be at least Hulk or Thor level in the comics as she’s defeated Hulk and Thor level characters like Wonderman or the Absorbing Man However against Odin and Thanos tier characters, she doesn’t compare, especially not to a Bloodlusted Hulk or Full power Thor.\n\nIn fact, this is where she actually stacks within the Marvel Universe.\n\nSupreme Being Level: Omniverse Level+\n\nOne Above All\n\nThe Over Monitor\n\nKami Tenchi\n\nThe Presence\n\nLiving Tribunal\n\nThe Spectre(Full Power)\n\nMulti-Eternity Level: Outverseal Level+\n\nAnti-Monitor\n\nThe Spectre\n\nBeyonder\n\nChaos King\n\nMolecule Man\n\nThe Emperor of Mankind(Warhammer 40k)\n\nGalactus with the Ultimate Nullifier\n\nMulti-Eternity beings\n\nAbstract Level: Hyperverisal Level+ to Outeverisal Level\n\nBelldandy(Ture form)\n\nPhoniex Force\n\nEternity\n\nDeath\n\nGalactus the Lifebringer\n\nSuper Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann\n\nCelestial Level: Multiversal Level+ to Hyperverisal Level\n\nGalactus fully fed\n\nZeus (DC Comics)\n\nSuper Boy Prime (DC Comics).\n\nPre Crisis Superman/\n\nPre Crisis Wonder Woman/God Wave Wonder Woman\n\nRune King Thor\n\nGhost Rider(Unrestricted/Zarathos’ Power)\n\nThe Celestials\n\nScarlet Witch(House of M)\n\nOdin full power\n\nKratos(God of War)\n\nImperiex-Prime (DC Comics).\n\nMr. Mxyzptlk\n\nSailor Cosmos\n\nZeno(Dragon Ball Super)\n\nWatchers\n\nHigh Skyfather Level: High Universe level to Multiversal Level+\n\nRen Amamiya(Persona 5)\n\nThor( Odin Force)\n\nOdin Base\n\nDragon Ball Super Top Tiers(Jiren, Zamasu, DBS Broly, Ultra Instinct Goku)\n\nHercules\n\nSailor Moon Characters(End of Series)\n\nMid Skyfather Level: Muitl Galaxy level to High Universe level+\n\nPoorly Fed Galactus\n\nDarkseid (Post-Crisis Avatars)\n\nCaptain Marvel via Binary\n\nDBGT Top tiers( SSJ4 Gogeta, Omega Shenron)\n\nMid Tier Dragon Ball Super characters\n\nLow Skyfather Level: Galaxy level to Muitl Galaxy level+\n\nMid Tier Sailor Moon characters\n\nBelldandy base\n\nAverage DBGT Characters\n\nLow tier Dragon Ball Super characters\n\nHigh Herald Level: Multi Solar System Level+ to Galaxy level\n\nDragon Ball Z Top Tiers\n\nIron Man (Extremis, Bleeding Edge armor, THORBUSTER Armor)\n\nGladiator\n\nLoki\n\nSilver Surfer\n\nStardust\n\nScarlet Witch base\n\nThor base\n\nHulk base\n\nPost Crisis Superman base\n\nPost Crisis Wonder Woman base\n\nWolverine(Attack Potency with adamantium claws)\n\nMCU Thanos\n\nMCU Thor and Hulk\n\nCaptain Marvel(Carl Manvers)\n\nMid-Herald Level: Large Star Level to Muilt Solar System level\n\nMy Little Pony Top Tiers\n\nDragonball Z Mid Tiers(Cell Saga)\n\nDeadpool’s carbonadium katanas\n\nHST God Tiers\n\nLow Tier Sailor Moon characters\n\nLow Herald Level\n\nDarth Vader\n\nFantastic Four\n\nOmega level Mutants\n\nEarly DBZ characters(Saiyan Saga/Namek Saga)\n\nFairy Tail God Tiers\n\nHigh Meta-Level\n\nHST Top Tiers\n\nFairy Tail Top Tiers\n\nMid Meta-Level: Multi-City Block Level to City Level\n\nCaptain America\n\nDeadpool\n\nWorlevine(Psychically)\n\nAverage Jedi/Sith\n\nAverage X Men Mutants\n\nSpiderman\n\nrestricted Ghost Rider\n\nLuke Cage\n\nIron Fist\n\nAverage Fairy Tail characters\n\nMid Tier HST characters\n\nLow Meta-Level: Large Building level+ to Multi-City Block level\n\nAverage FMA characters\n\nAverage Avatar characters\n\nHigh Street Level: Small Building Level to Large Building level+\n\nLow Tier HST characters\n\nMid Street Level: Wall Level to Small Building level\n\nBatman\n\nBlack Widow\n\nPunisher\n\nHawkeye\n\nHercule\n\nResident Evil characters\n\nLow Street Level: Street level to Wall Level\n\nWWE Wrestlers\n\nMany Movie Action heroes\n\nIn other words for those Marvel shills who want to push the narrative that “Captain Marvel is the strongest of the Avengers”, remind them that even the comics never had her beat Thanos, especially Thanos without the Infinity Gauntlet and never did anything remotely as impressive as what the Scarlet Witch and Wonder Woman repeatedly do on a daily basis.\n\nAnd this is whether i think the comics are really suffering in sales, The old Marvel comics were about superheroism, exploring new worlds, new civilizations, interesting backstories and lores about various alien races like the Skrulls and Kree and fighting alongside God-Like beings like Odin and fighting against monsters like Galactus. Heros actually were heroes and yes comics like X Men tackled prejucide, it was never on the nose about it and made even sympathetic villains within the extreme side, they balanced light-hearted stories and heroic stories with the dark and gritty realism and the harsh reality of the Multiverse.\n\nNowadays it’s just shitty SJW Identity politics and politcal posturing that these comics tend to do.\n\nInstead of complex issues, we get simplistic dumbed down messages, instead of this vast Multiverse with 47,000,000 confirmed Alternative Universes, we get this strange obsession of basing 99% of all stories within America under Trump because fuck exploring a faraway planet in hopes to cure cancer, let’s waste most of our stories making shitty cheap shots against Trump and America because we totally never seen that before right?\n\nInstead of Superheros who encourage people to overcome bias and bigotry.\n\nWe have Superheros straight up encouraging bigotry.\n\nRemember when comic book superheroes were condemned for violating countless human rights? Now we have Heros casually committing human rights violations with no consequences\n\nAnd Captain Marvel as i said before is at the forefront of this ugly, unpleasant change to the Marvel comic book industry and comics as a whole.\n\nAnd for what i heard about the ending of Endgame, it seems like the Marvel Cinematic Universe is going down the same path as the comics. I’ve yet to see Endgame myself but i heard good and bad things about it, most of the bad things unsurprisingly was Brie Larson as Captain Marvel( which i look forward to hating), either way i will review Endgame at the end of the week and give my thoughts and try to separate my hatred of Captain Marvel as much as possible, keyword try however if the MCU is going down the same “Woke” direction as the comics, oh boy are we in for some shit.\n\nOnce again Captain Marvel might be powerful in her own right but she’s not that special when you literally compare her to Hulk or Thor and i don’t just mean in sheer raw power, i mean in legacy. When the comic book industry inevitable collapses, people won’t look back to shitty trendy Superheros like Kamala Khan, Carl Manvers or many of these SJW heros, they’re going to remember real Superheros like Thor, Captain America, Scarlet Witch, Rogue and Worlevine, characters who withstood the test of time. In 10 years, no one is going to remember these SJW characters and if they do, they will remember them as the bratty little shit characters who can’t stand up to classic heros.\n\nAs requested by\n\n( UPDATE: Updated the size of the Muitiverse based on the Muitverse forumala)\n\nby IreneBelserion69, Jun 3, 2019, 4:12:44 AM\n\nJournals / Personal\n\nKirby brings his copy abilities to Death Battle!\n\nYep, we’re tackling possibly one of Nintendo’s strongest video game characters and one of the strongest video game characters in gaming Kirby. Yes really, this little puffball can pack a massive punch.\n\nStrength\n\nDespite being a mere 8 Inches Tall and weighing as much as a ballon, this puff ball isn’t just deceptively strong, he’s terrifying strong.\n\n\\\n\nOne of the lower end physical feats is how Kirby can casually crack the entire planet of Popstar with a single punch within a minigame.\n\nGoing by Popstar’s shape, it’s likely a large planet the size of Saturn but the mass of a Rocky planet so let’s do some math on the size of the planet.\n\nLength of Popstar:391px(116,464,000m)\n\nWidth of the planet:379px(112,889,600 m)\n\nDepth of the planet:135px(40,211,355.4m)\n\nVolume of the planet:5.286817871148757e+23 m^3\n\nThe Earth’s volume, by contrast, is only 1.08 quadrillion cubic kilometers (259 trillion cubic miles) or 1.08×10^15 m^3, Popstar has a volume over 489,520,173.254 times that of Earth. Now for the mass of the planet.\n\nDensity of Earth: 5503kg/m^3\n\nMass of Popstar:2.909335874493161e+27 kg\n\nPopstar is roughly half the mass of Saturn despite being smaller overall due to lack of depth, now for the GBE.\n\nWhere U = GBE in joules, M = the mass of the body in question in kilograms, r = its radius in meters, and G = the gravitational constant of 6.67408×10^-11.\n\nU=3GM^2/5R\n\nU=0.00000000000667×2.909335874493161e+27 kg^2/56,444,800 mx5\n\nU=0.00000000002001×8.464235230612886e+54kg^2/282,224,000 m\n\nU=6.001238270471818e+35 Joules\n\n6.001238270471818e+35 joule = 143 433 037 060 000 000 000 megaton [explosive] or 143.433 Yottatons of TNT\n\nGBE of Popstar:143.433 Yottatons of TNT( Large Planet level+)\n\nPopstar despite being of Earth’s Gravity and half of Saturns mass has nearly 30% of Jupiter’s GBE which shows you how massive the planet is despite being an oddly shaped flatish planet.

The sun’s gravity is 28 times that of Earth giving the gravity pull roughly 274.68 m/s.\n\nGiven the frying pan didn’t melt, this means the frying pan was far from the sun’s coronasphere but close enough to roast the monster alive so between Mercury and the sun which is roughly 20,000,000,000 m from the sun’s Coronasphere.\n\nP.E.=MxGxH\n\nP.E.=245,394.97 kgx274.68 m/sx20,000,000,000 m\n\nP.E.=1.348101807192e+18\n\n1 348 101 807 192 000 000 joule = 322.204 064 82 megaton [explosive]\n\nGPE of the Frying Pan=322.204 Megatons of TNT(Mountain Level)\n\nThing is crazy throwing/destructive feats aren’t outliers, they’re fairly consistent with the Pink puffball.\n\nAnother crazier feat was tossing a clown into deep space at least 3,000 Lightyears away within 18 seconds going by this calc here.\n\nNow for throwing energy and the force of the throw.\n\nKriby:402px(20.32 cm)\n\nClown Height:631px(31.895 cm)\n\nClown Length:305px(15.42 cm)\n\nClown Width:31px(1.5672 cm)\n\nClown Volume:770.8204151409836 cm^3\n\nDenisty of human flesh: 1.01 g/cm^3\n\nWeight of the clown:778.5286192923934 Grams or 0.779 Kilograms\n\n3,000 Lightyearsx63241.077088071 AU’sx149,597,870,690.99=2.838219141774053e+19 meters\n\nhttp://www.convertunits.com/from/mete…\n\n149,597,870,690.99997 meters=1 AU\n\nhttp://www.convertunits.com/from/ligh…\n\n63241.077088071 AU’s= One Light Year\n\nNow for speed.\n\n2.838219141774053e+19 meters /18=1.576788412096696e+18 m/s\n\nLight travels at 299,792,458 m/s\n\nSpeed=5,259,599,999.999653 c or 5.259 Billion times the speed of light\n\nF=MxV^2xD\n\nF=0.779 kgx1.576788412096696e+18 m/s^2×2.838219141774053e+19\n\nF=1.25985394126526e+37 Nx2.838219141774053e+19\n\nF=3.575741571938544e+56 J\n\n3.575741571938544e+56 joule = 8.5462274664e+40 megaton [explosive] or 854.622 GigaFoe (Solar System level+)\n\nKriby’s Clown Toss: 854.622 GigaFoe (Solar System level+)\n\nMerely throwing his opponent into a black hole generates roughly the force of 5,228 Solar Kamhahka waves with the force of 163.47 MegaFoe each\n\nAnother feat is tossing the villain Marx into the planet NOVA which is roughly the size of Popstar but made purely of metal.

Magalor is said to be capable of destroying entire Universes.\n\nA villain which merely his soul was able to casually warp the entire galaxy that they’re fighting within so casual Galaxy level reality warping with a weakened boss character and Kriby is able to fight on par with.\n\nGalacta Knight was stated to be galaxy level by a very legible source. (NOVA the wish-granting comet) Meta Knight in Meta Knightmare wished for the opportunity to defeat the strongest warrior in the galaxy. NOVA granted that wish, and Meta Knight won. Considering Kirby regularly is the victor in his battles with Meta Knight, and has also defeated Galacta himself(Kirby Super Star Ultra: The True Arena), well……\n\nNightmare is immensely powerful who was going to spread nightmares all around the galaxy, This confirms Kirby in stronger states with the Star Rod being at least Galaxy Level +! and this is massively lowballing considering Kirby’s able to destroy a small Galaxy sized planet with a Massively FTL meteor giving a Universe level+ yield.\n\nHowever as Death Battle noted, Kirby’s true power is literally Universe level. It’s confirmed to being it’s very own Universe within the Death Battle and the animated series. Imaginary Axis did a whole video on just how big Kirby’s stomach is\n\nKirby has the inner Universal mass of 3.4 Million Galaxies within his pocket Universe, that’s roughly 4.08x48kg’s Kirby’s Pocket Universe which is over twice the size of the Pisces–Cetus Supercluster Complex. The Pisces–Cetus Supercluster Complex is a galaxy filament. It includes the Virgo Supercluster which in turn contains the Local Group, the galaxy cluster that includes the Milky Way, a 1.08 Billion Light year-long stretch of the Universe is around 1/93th the size of the Observable Universe, meaning Kirby’s pocket Universe dimension is at least 1/46th the size of the Observable Universe.\n\nWith speed and expansion of 3,500 Lightyears per day, this means Kirby’s Suction speed is faster than light. This means Kriby’s suction speed is moving at 2561.846 AU’s per second or 383,246,706,638,230 m/s or 1,278,373. c.

The third time they fought, it’s clear that Landia EX was not holding back. This is another Unvierse level+ final boss.\n\nKriby also defeated Dark Tarzana, who was massively superior to Parallel Landia, almost the final boss, who in turn, was also massively superior to Landia EX.\n\nKirby also defeated Marx Soul, who created a universe with countless stars. Said universe ceases to exist after his defeat.\n\nWithin the battle against Magolor, who used the universe itself as a weapon, including a multitude of galaxies.\n\nthumbs.gfycat.com/OblongDisgui…\n\nKirby also defeated Dark Mind, who nearly conquered both the Mirror Dimension and Dream Land. The Mirror Dimension is a universe with an innumerate amount of stars, and Dark Mind not only corrupted it, but can manipulate its entirety)\n\nHowever, Kirby’s power is actually possibly Multiversal as he was able to fight the Void Termina, a Multiversal threat that threatened the entire Kirby Multiverse.\n\nAs seen with Kirby’s travel speed feats, Dimmeisonal creatures who can casually bend all of 4 Dimmeisonal Space and, Conssienset Universe busting Final Bosses and Kirby being a possible 5th DImmeisonal entity himself with a pocket Universe within his ballon mass body.\n\nIf anything, as seen within the gameplay of Return to Dreamland Kirby, is able to physically hold back briefly the collapse of the entire Universe during the escape scene of escaping a dying Universe. Kirby was also Was able to hold back the wave that was consuming the parallel universe Magolor and his crew fought in, this would make Kirby easily Universe level.\n\nThe same wave is later shown destroying the parallel Universe. Going by timeframe, the explosion destroyed the parallel Universe in roughly 2 minutes.\n\nAssuming one of the Kirby Universes is the same as our own, it should be 23.5 Trillion Light Years Wide and Long and having a thickness of at least 235 Billion Lightyears giving it the volume of 1.083314312985248e+88 m^3 or 1.14506413233621e+72 Cubic Lightyears with the mass of 1.62×10^60 kg.\n\nThe timeframe of the chase scene in the video is roughly 25 seconds before the Universe implodes. This means the Universe imploded within 930,000,000,000 Light Years Per Second or 8.79848252714505e+27 m/s . That means the Universe collapsed at 10 times the Observable Universe size per second or roughly 2.934857863283889e+19 c/ or 29.348 Quintillion times the speed of Light.\n\nE=MC^2/2\n\nE=1.62×10^60 kgx 8.79848252714505e+27 m/s^2/2\n\nE= 1.62×10^60 kgx 7.741329478047675e+55 m/2\n\nE=1.254095375443723e+116 Joules\n\n1.254095375443723e+116 joule = 2.9973598839e+100 megaton [explosive] or\n\n1.061 Yotta UniFoe\n\nMalagamor’s Universal Collapse: 1.061 Yotta UniFoe (Unvierse Level+)\n\nNow for Kirby stopping this Universal collapsing Dimmeisonal Rift even momentary yes Kirby physically stopped a collapsing Universe even for a few seconds with his exahaltion, how much more powerful can Kirby be to physically hold back a collapsing Universe. Kirby seemed to move the mass of the collapsing Universe roughly 3 meters pre-attack which gave him enough time to escape the wave, meaning Kirby produced roughly 3 times as much force as the Universe collapsing meaning merely exhaling stars from his mouth, Kirby could stop Universe busting attacks.\n\nThe Kirby Multiverse is confirmed to be pretty much a Mutiverse, especially with the various dimensions having many galaxies present within the backgrounds.\n\nAnd this is literally nothing compared to the Void Terminal power who can destroy the entire Kirby Multiverse. Several edivence within the games prior to hint within Parrael Dimensions and realities within the Kirby Universe .\n\nSo going by the “Destroyer of worlds” moniker, Void Termina would at the very least be Low Muitversial if not Mutiverisal.\n\nhttps://beyond-universe.fandom.com/wiki/Multiverse#:~:text=The%20diameter%20of%20the%20Local%20Multiverse%20is%20on,with%20a%20finite%20or%20infinite%20number%20of%20universes.\n\nThe Multiverse is very huge. Our Local Multiverse has approximately 10^10^10^120 universes, although a multiverse can contain anywhere from only 2 universes to omega universes. Our universe lasts long, most of them only live for xonoseconds and pop. The diameter of the Local Multiverse is on the order of 92,200,000,000 * 10^10^10^120 light years across! A multiverse is a self-contained group or larger bubble filled with a finite or infinite number of universes. In many cases, the term is used to define a larger bubble filled with a finite or infinite number of universes. In many cases, the term is used to define the hypothetical set of every single possible universe, including the universe in which we live.\n\nNow to sum up this mind blowing number,the a real Mutivlerse is 9.3e+120,000 lightyears across, a mind blowingly large size beyond comprehension, by multiplying the dimensional space by the 3rd power, we get a 3 dimensional volume of our Multiverse at 8.04357e+360,002 Cubic Light Years in volume. You need a bare minimum of roughly8.04357e+360,002 Joules to blow up all Universes within a 3-D Dimensional Muitiviersial space\n\nhttps://roleplayingblog414201607.wordpress.com/2020/01/04/the-scale-of-universe-busting/\n\nLow Multiversal Level(1,000 4 D Universes+Infinte 3D Universes):4.307432805138255×10^207J(10 Septentrigintillion Big Bangs) or 38.33 TriTenaYotta UniFoe/1 MuitFoe\n\nMultiverse Level (5th Dimensional busting on 1,000 Universes or 3-d busting of 10^10^10^120 universes):8.04357e+360,002‬ Joules\n\nHigh Multiverse Level(1,000 5th Dimensional Multiverse Busting,Infinite 4 Dimensional Busting of 10^10^10^120 universes ): At least 1.741105116668646e+‬720,004 Joules\n\nLow Complex Multiverse level:(Infinite 4th and 5th dimensional busting of 10^10^10^120 universes, 6 Dimensional to 7 Dimensional busting of the Mutiverse)At least 1.741105116668646e+1,440,008‬ ‬J to1.741105116668646e+ 2,880,016J\n\nComplex Multiverse level:(7-9 Dimensional Multiverse Busting)::1.985832917233346e+‭‭5,508,864‬ J to 1.985832917233346e+‭‭11,017,728‬ J)\n\nHigh Complex Multiverse Level:(9-11 Dimensional Multiverse Busting):1.985832917233346e+‭22,035,456‬ J to 1.985832917233346e+44,070,912 J\n\nLow Hyperverse level: (fucking with with muptile 11 Dimmeisonal realites at once, up to 12th Dimmeisonal)1.985832917233346e+‭88,141,824‬ J\n\nHyperverisal level(Characters with a finite number of dimensions greater than 11, brder is from 12 Dimensional to as high as 42 Dimensional)\n\nUp to 1.985832917233346e‭+2.366039071811174e+16‬ Joules\n\nHigh Hyperversial Level(At least more than 1×10^16 Dimensions/Infinte Dimmeisonal busting)\n\nInfinite Joules\n\nOuterverse level (Boundless, beyond infinte Dimensions, This is something completely formless, abstract, metaphysical and transcendental.

So bare Minimum Kriby would be Complex Multiverse level+ or 1 C in terms of power.\n\nSpeed\n\nKirby is also ridiculously fast as seen with various feats within the series.\n\nAs seen with Meta Knight’s casual speed, eh leaped across another Solar System in a single flight less than 5 Seconds. Given Alpha, Centura is the closest to our Solar System at 4.36 Light Years, that means Meta Knight at bare minimum casually flew at 8,249,746,916,001,680 m/s or 59,958,491.6 c and this was a farily casual speed feat compared to feats later shown.\n\nTo put into context, this is over 4 times faster than Vegeta’s Final Flash against Cell which crossed the same distance in roughly 12 seconds. Believe me when i say there are far faster feats.\n\nKirby’s reflexes and reaction/combat speed scales to Metal Knight Naturally.\n\nKirby with his warp star casually moved across a whole galaxy in less than a second. To travel 100,000 light years a second, you would need to move at 9.460733900093359e+20 m/s /3,155,761,143,295.126 c or 3.155 Trillion times the speed of Light and that’s literally nothing compared to this other speed feat.\n\nGoing by this feat, shadows are shown constantly travel across 6 galaxies within seconds. Given the distance between the Aredmoerna Galaxy and Milky Way Galaxy is 2.2 Million Light Years from each other, going by Roach Limit of Galaxies, that means that the galaxies are 13.2 Million Light Years, this means Kirby’s stronger enemies has the speed of 2.2 Million Light Years per second.\n\nhttp://www.convertunits.com/from/mete…\n\n149,597,870,690.99997 meters=1 AU\n\nhttp://www.convertunits.com/from/ligh…\n\n63241.077088071 AU’s= One Light Year\n\nLight travels at 299,792,458 m/s\n\nShadow’s movement speed:2.08728477674845e+22 m/s or 69,624,325,797,697.37 c(Massively FTL+)\n\nKirby and co. fly from one universe to another in 3 seconds, yeah you’re not hearing wrong. The multiverse theory applies to the Kirby Universe and there is transversal travel within this series. That’s a crazy amount of time to travel from one Universe to another.\n\nEven Gods from Dragonball Super don’t travel this fast. Just how fast is Kirby?\n\nCaptain Marvel strongest Marvel character DEBUNKED\n\n(Due to the internet outage Wednesday, this journal was delayed by several days, this was originally intended to come out before Endgame to address the problems of making Captain Marvel Thanos level both in the comics and within the MCU itself, this would likely be outdated as this update is being written with the release of Endgame, sorry for the inconvenience caused by the internet outage. Inevitably due to inevitable shitty writing, i half expect Captain Marvel to defeat Thanos singlehandedly with no real effort and further piss on the grave of the MCU and look forward to hating the hell out of Endgame, boy that would be fun!\n\nUpdate: Updated the size of the Universe and revised allUniverse calcs due to new numbers in preparation for the Kirby respect thread soon.\n\nAlso redid calcs that used the 1×10^12 muplticaion now that i learned how to do those right, fixed all mathematical errors, will be updating DBZ too)\n\nBecause you have\n\nRemember my Captain Marvel strongest debunked and DBZtard pwnage videos, i briefly talked about the size of the Universes of various fictions, however, those would require revisions and we’re not taking into account the Roache Limit nor the size of the actual Universe.\n\nwww.space.com/24073-how-big-is…\n\nInstead of taking one measurement method, a team of scientists led by Mihran Vardanyan at the University of Oxford did a statistical analysis of all of the results. By using Bayesian model averaging, which focuses on how likely a model is to be correct given the data, rather than asking how well the model itself fits the data. They found that the universe is at least 250 times larger than the observable universe, or at least 7 trillion light-years across.\n\nGoing by the Sicnfetic models, we got two sizes of the actual Universe size, 7 Trillion Light Years that can be used for the Low End and 23.25 Trillion Light Years as a high end.\n\nNow let’s take into account the Roache Limit to separate the Universes. That’s between 25 to 30 times the length of the celestial object. So let’s go with the 25 times for Roach Limit. We’re going to redo the entire DB Multiverse and Marvel Multiverse calc.\n\nThis means that we got a High-End Distance between the Universes between 175 Trillion Light Years and 581.25 Trillion Light Years which is thousands of times the length of our Observable Universe.\n\nhttp://www.convertunits.com/from/mete…\n\n149,597,870,690.99997 meters=1 AU\n\nhttp://www.convertunits.com/from/ligh…\n\n63241.077088071 AU’s= One Light Year\n\nLight travels at 299,792,458 m/s\n\nen.wikipedia.org/wiki/Names_of…\n\n1.655625814564557e+30 m/s or 5.5225732682193e+21 c or 5.522 Sextillion times the speed of light\n\n5.496684396914271e+30 m/s or 1.833496557446509e+22 c /18.33 Sextillion times the speed of light\n\nNow divide by 3 seconds\n\n5.51875271521519e+29 m/s or 1.8408577560731e+21 c or 1.84 Sextillion times the speed of light\n\n1.832228132304757e+30 m/s or 6.111655191488363e+21 c /6.11\n\nSextillion times the speed of light\n\nKriby’s Warpstar Universe speed: 1.84 Sextillion c Low End\n\n6.11 Sextillion c High End\n\nAnd if you think Kirby’s speed is crazy, he can further enhance his agility, speed, and reflexes with an ability known as Star Warrior sense. It’ds an anime and manga based ability that gives Kirby Precognition abilites and the ability to sense attacks coming at him up to planetary distances.\n\nCombined with Kirby’s already crazy speed, it would be very hard to blitz him unless you’re faster than traveling the Roache Limit between Universes within a second.\n\nAs seen with Meta Knight, SWS can sense powers and energies across entire planets and star systems.\n\nAccording to Meta Knight in the Japanese dub of the Kirby anime, let’s Kirby fight based purely on instinct. it letsKirby know when and where an attack is coming from, it letsMeta Knight, to whom Kirby certainly compares, sense people who are on other planets.\n\nIt even works when he’s asleep, when he fell asleep from hunger while fighting Dark Meta Knight, beat the shit out of him while still sleeping in his Bell Kirby form. It’s basically a combination of Observation Haki, Ultra Instinct, and Spider-Sense, but better.\n\nDurability\n\nDuring his battle with Queen Sectiona, Kirby tanked an explosion that took up the size of Popstar. Given the size of Popstar, the explosion would at least equal the enegery equipment of at least the GBE of Uranus at 2.7 Yottatons of TN giving Kirby casual Large Planet level durability\n\nKirby has faced many small black holes that range from large planet level to star level.\n\nThe first one here is at least 30.67cm wide, using this calculator, this black hole has the mass of 34.58 Earth Masses in density, moving at lightspeed, the force generated from the black hole. Going by E=MC^2/2 or E=5.9722×1024 kgX34.58×299,792,458 m/s^2/2, we get the energy of 9.280486478043547e+42 Joules or 2.21TenaKilotons of TNT which is Large Star level.\n\nThe largest micro blackhole Kirby tanked is this one which is 4.3 times bigger than him. The blackhole is roughly 87.464 cm wide, using the same calculator, we get roughly 98.81 Earth masses. Going by E=MC^2/2 or E=5.9722×10^24 kgX98.81 x299,792,458 m/s^2/2, we get the energy of 2.0361635475869e+43 Joules or 4.87 TenaKilotons of TNT which is Large Star level+\n\nKirby has also survived massive explosions that drawfed entire galaxies\n\nAlso, Kirby fought Marx, who after absorbing Nova created an alternate dimension that has at least 53 “squiggles” in the background that heavily resemble galaxies, so this could be a universe-sized dimension. When this multi-galaxy to universe sized dimension collapsed following Marx’s defeat, Kirby was there when it collapsed and was completely unharmed.\n\nKirby using his most powerful state and his full power against him confirms this and the fact Kirby has tanked attacks from this cosmic reality wrapper proves Kirby can withstand anything less than a Big Bang.\n\nWhen Kirby defeated Magolor, it caused the parallel dimension Magolor created to collapse. Kirby outran this, pushed back the universe-collapsing wave for a while, and is tougher than Magolor, who SURVIVED his parallel universe collapsing. This means Kirby would be able to tank Universe destroying attacks.\n\nAlso, in Kirby: Squeak Squad, Kirby fought an eldritch abomination of darkness called Dark nebula and killed him just because Kirby thought that Dark Nebula stole his cake . When Dark Nebula appeared, his awakening wiped out a galaxy that had been created by Dark Daroach (who Dark Nebula had been possessing). Assuming this galaxy had the same radius as the milky way (52,850 light years), this comes out to 2.237 yottafoe, 176.459 times what’s needed to wipe out the milky way, putting Dark Nebula at galaxy level! And Kirby fought him in a 2.82 million light-years wide black hole and was not even exhausted!\n\nwww.omnicalculator.com/physics…\n\nGoing by the Blackhole calculator, a Blackhole that is 2.82 million light years has the mass of 9,031,452,423,442,333,492 or 9.031 Quintillion Suns.\n\nwww.space.com/25959-how-many-s…\n\nThat’s roughly 90,314,524.23 times as many stars in our Milky Way Galaxy or 12,902,074.8906319 times the mass of the Milky Way Galaxy.\n\nGoing by the mass of the Blackhole and it moving at least Lightspeed or 299,792,458 m/s, the energy of the black hole would be roughly 8.117064637083979e+65 Joules of Energy or 8.117064637083979e+65 1.94 ZettaFoe per second Kirby tanked within the massive black hole.\n\nThis would put Kribys Durability at minimum Small Galaxy level as he tanked nearly 1/5th the force to desotry a whole galaxy in his fight with Dark Nebula but again this is assuming the black hole is moving merely at Lightspeed. Even merely going at Lightspeed, the black hole alone generated the force of roughly 8.2771024122e+64 Kgs, which is roughly the weight of 6.9 Trillion Observable Universes.\n\nIf we assume the galaxy is moving as fast tas Dark Nebuk’s causal vaporization of a galaxy, that would make the potential blackhole over 9.460733900093359e+20 m/s /3,155,761,143,295.126 c or 3.155 Trillion times the speed of Light. Let’s estimate the true power of the Gamble Galaxy Blackhole.\n\nMass of the Blackhole: 9,031,452,423,442,333,492 or 9.031 Quintillion Suns(1.8062×10^48kg)\n\nVelocity:9.460733900093359e+20 m/s\n\nE=MC^2/2\n\nE=1.8062×10^48kgx9.460733900093359e+20 m/s^2/2\n\nE= 1.8062×10^48kgx8.95054859283757e+41 m/2\n\nE=1.616648086838322e+90\n\n1.616648086838322e+90 joule = 3.8638816607e+74 megaton [explosive] 38.68 TenapetaFoe\n\nGamble Galaxy Black Hole: 38.68 TenapetaFoe of TNT (Multi Galaxy level +)\n\nIn other words, this black hole is producing roughly 1/175th the power of the Big Bang And kriby not only shrugs off the effects of the attack, but he also fights the final boss within this Massive Blackhole 25 times longer than the Milky Way Galaxy tanking the intense gravity of the black hole. A Blackhole can assert up to 1.6166480868e+90 Netwons of force on his body which is just unheard of, that means in the blackhole Kirby is carrying the mass of 1.6485222648e+89kg which is roughly the mass of 20 Undecillion Observable Universes, imagine tanking the weight of 20 Undecillion Universes.\n\nAnd if you think killing Kirby is hard enough. Kirby can just casually rip himself in half and throw his body parts like a boomerang which makes him next to impossible to kill by conventional methods\n\nHe can even reform his body exploding himself and return back to normal, with no bones or even any notable organs, he can shrug off most attacks that can be fatal to anyone else.\n\nAnd in his Ghost form can revive himself from death if he’s killed, Kirby is considered a Type 3 immortal without powers meaning he can regenerate and has the ability to regenerate being cut to pieces and as Ghost Kirby, he can regenerate from complete destruction of his body meaning he can come back from even scattered or lone molecules, atoms, particles, or even pure energy.\n\nAccuracy of Kirby vs Majin Buu\n\nAllow me to address my problems with Death Battle for a minute. While i agree with the overall decision here of Kirby beating Majin Buu, the problem here is that they far downplayed Majin Buu in this fight. Let me address several problems i had with Death Battle’s research here.\n\n1)Buu’s durability is far above Planet level, Frieza a far weaker character surrived the explosion on Namek and he’s far superior to Perfect Cell who is stated to be a Solar System buster.\n\n2)Buu is much faster than the speed of light DB, that was bullshit on your part! This is a legitimate downplaying which is just shitty, lazy research on your part.\n\nWe’re going to go over these two because this is one of the few times i kinda agree with DBZtards about Buu being screwed over. If there is anything i hate as much as DBZ wank, it’s DBZ downplay which just brings me to a small side rant.\n\n1) Majin Buu isn’t above Planet level! DEBUNKED\n\nI think this a mistake that Death Battle did in their own shoddy research because even the ODB have Kid Buu at least Star level with their calcs.\n\nvsbattles.wikia.com/wiki/Majin…\n\nHowever, let’s bring up some canonical facts into Buu’s Destructive power and durability.\n\nSalty DBZtard threatens to dox me\n\n(Update: Updated the size of the Universe and revised all Universe calcs due to new numbers in preparation for the Kirby respect thread soon.\n\nAlso redid calcs that used the 1×10^12 muplticaion now that i learned how to do those right, fixed all mathematical errors, will be updating DBZ too)\n\nOf all the butthurt retards I’ve encountered on the internet, this has to be the saltiest one. DBZtards are well known for their sheer stupidity but this bitch nigga by the name of :Iconlyterious: takes it to a whole new level of faggotry by threatening to dox me because i raped his ass hard in a debate. No joke, this bitch nigga actually threatened yours truly because i dare called him out for his stupidity.\n\n:iconlyterious:\n\nLyterious 5 hours ago\n\nYou’re not providing any evidence either and secondarily the only cuckold I see h\n\nPalnetbusting is no big deal to characters with a power level of 10,000.\n\nFireza with a power level of 530,000 leveled Planet Vegeta,\n\nLet’s factor Frieza’s power level of 3,000,000 which is 2,000 times faster than Raditz’s 1.1c and him kicking Vegeta’s attack which would make far more sense. This would give Frieza a casual speed of 600,000,000 km/sec or 600,000,000,000 m/s, now let’s go back to the mass of 1.8072e+17kg per Ki Blast times velocity times the speed of Light and we get roughly 3.25296e+40 joules or 7.7747609943e+24 megatons of TNT/ 7.77 Tenatons which in English gives Frieza Small Star level Enegery in his Final Form at 5%, multiplying this by 20 and you get Frieza’s Maximum Attack potency at 155.4 Tenatons which actually pushes Frieza to Star level.\n\nSuper Vegeta, a character confirmed weaker than Perfect Cell is able to create a small Supernova sized explosion with his Final Flash.\n\nAnd Cell is stated to be a Solar System buster which is about reasonable given powerscaling plus Super Vegeta’s feat was 32.84931 KiloFoe alone and he was easily many times weaker than Super Prefect Cell.\n\nAnd Cell is literally nothing to Buu as Buu in fat form casually rekted Dabrua who’s at least Perfect Cell level and this was a heavily surpesssed, weakened Fat Buu that recently reawakened.\n\nAnd was able to beat the crap out of Majin Vegeta who clashed evenly with SSJ2 Goku who’s 10 times SSJ2 Gohan and Cells power and this is merely the weakest Majin Buu.\n\n2) Majin Buu isn’t FTL DEBUNKED\n\nAnother claim i think is horsehit is that Majin Buu isn’t FTL according to Death Battle which is bullshit.\n\nIt should be noted that Goku’s Brother Radtiz was faster than Piccolo who shot a casual Ki blast that hit the moon within seconds which puts Piccolo and Goku with power levels below Raditz between 1/5 and 1/4th the speed of Light and making Raditz at least Lightspeed or FTL given he reacted to both Goku’s Kamehameha wave with the dub outright saying that Radtiz is “FTL”Which makes sense given Piccolo at least than half power hit the Moon with his Destructive Wave which blew up the moon in 2-4 seconds.\n\nFor King Kai to not be able to track Goku and Frieza’s speed despite tracking ships 26,841 times the speed of Light. Frieza would be 80,000 times the speed of light and Goku would be 100,000 times the speed of light powerscaling from Raditz and the comparable feats there.\n\nKid Buu is at the very least Massively FTL. power scaling merely from Frieza and Goku alone who are many times weaker than Buu, hell the Andriods who pale in comparison to Cell( Who Fat Buu is alone 10 times stronger than the strongest cell) casually stomp and blitz the sayains.\n\nAnd Namek Saga Fireza is so much weaker and slower than Buu Saga characters that a rusty Gohan in base one shotted him easily(Granted this is non canon but proves my point regardless)\n\nHell his feat shown of destroying a whole galaxy in 3-5 years actually further debunk the downplay of both his speed and power DB did.\n\nAs for Kid Buu, a lot of people use this statement from Goku about Kid Buu’s power that there’s enough Ki to blow up the earth over 10 times over however they completely ignore the context of Goku’s statements nor take into account Mass Enegery times Faster than Light.\n\nThe Mass Energy of Earth is 5.4×10^41 Joules, that’s over 2.37 the GBE of the Sun blowing up the entire Earth at Light speed. Kid Buu himself has mass eqauilvent of that in a single Ki Blast which is extremely casual Star level and that’s merely going by Lightspeed explosions which they’re far faster than that.\n\nKid Buu is at least 100 Trillion c, Light travels at 299,792,458 m/s or 300,000km/s , going by powerscaling, Kid Buu should have at least speed up to 2.99792458e+22 meters per second. Going by Mass Energy, Kid Buu should have an attack Potency at least up to 540 GigaFoe, just 1/37th the baseline of Muilt"
