But it's definitely not tanking it at close range or anything nearing star level\n\nLarge Star Level is not going to be enough to destroy Mogo and Mogo can kill you while you are on his surface, in fact Buu would be in even more trouble if he landed on Mogo who can pretty much atomize by charging up his will power and unleash it, because Muu would be in point blank range.\n\nPost by Avenger Angra Mainyu on\n\nWhat were makes this planet special so it can fight with buu ?\n\nIt is the heart of the entire lantern corps. The Green Lantern corps is powered by will power and Mogo is one of the strongest in the green lantern Corps.\n\nThink about it, Mogo is a planet that was given the power ring which is one of the strongest weapons in the DC universe.\n\nDC: Mogo can literally atomize Buu by trapping him him using his gravity and then charging up his power ring until buu is atomized.\n\nChlorokinesis: Mogo can control any plant in his own atmosphere.\n\nInterstellar Travel: MFTL +\n\nWeather Manipulation: Mogo can change his own climate.\n\nGravity Manipulation: Mogo can increase the pull of gravity on himself. (his gravity is so powerful that he could literally rip other planets apart in an instant.\n\nGeokinesis: Mogo can move his own soil at will.\n\nTelepathy: Mogo is responsible for guiding the Green Lantern rings to new sentient beings after their hosts die.\n\nTelekinesis: All lanterns are granted this.\n\nMogo has a rebreathable atmosphere.\n\nAlso The Green power ring has the power to make almost anything the user wants into a reality.\n\nPost by Avenger Angra Mainyu on\n\nI think Buu could win all rounds.\n\nI don't think so Mogo is far to versatile to be beaten all rounds.\n\nMogo can literally atomize Buu by trapping him him using his gravity and then charging up his power ring until buu is atomized.\n\nChlorokinesis: Mogo can control any plant in his own atmosphere.\n\nInterstellar Travel: MFTL +\n\nWeather Manipulation: Mogo can change his own climate.\n\nGravity Manipulation: Mogo can increase the pull of gravity on himself.

Based of the battlefiled. I took it as the two being are in space, Buu isn't on Mogo himself but in space near mogo. Meaning he won't be affected by the majority of his abilities. Which means the following abilities can't be used against Buu since Buu isn't on the planet\n\nGravity manip\n\nGeokinesis\n\nweather manip\n\nChlorokinesis\n\nMogo has telepathy but has never used it offensively and it never displayed TK. It has good travel speed but it's not like it going to blitz Buu, when it can't use in combat and his a giant planet.\n\nBeucase of the way the fight is setup Buu just as to fire planetary blasts at Mogo since the majority of his abilities are limited to his own planet."
