        "text": "Pages 1-103\n\nIntroduction by Akira Toriyama\n\nThe Daizenshuu this time around covers the second half of the Dragon Ball anime. Come to think of it, apparently the TV series is going to continue for a little bit longer, as a brand-new story not present in the original. It seems well thought-out and promises to be interesting; or at least that’s what I gather from the rough scripts they’ve shown me, which give a broad outline of how it’ll be. From now on I can be just like everyone else, simply watching the TV broadcasts at home and wondering with bated breath what on Earth will happen next. I’m looking forward to it, and my thanks go out to all the staff.\n\n— Akira Toriyama\n\nThe TV anime DBZ's path to becoming the strongest warrior is drawn in color!\n\nTerrible Emperor Freeza\n\nFear! Frieza\n\nDragon Ball Z Episodes 75 to 107\n\n(Broadcasted on January 23, 1991 to September 11, 1991)\n\nGoku heals his wounds from the battle against Ginyu with a medical capsule. Meanwhile, Gohan and his friends borrow the power of Dende and successfully summon Porunga. He revives Piccolo and warps him to Planet Namek. However, before they can make their final wish, the eldest's lifespan ends, and the Dragon Balls become just stones... At that moment, Frieza appears in front of Gohan and his friends. Having lost his wish for immortality, Frieza becomes enraged and transforms into his second form, attacking Gohan and his friends. Piccolo, who has increased his power by fusing with Nail, joins the battle. However, Frieza transforms into his third and final form and overwhelms Piccolo and his friends. Even Vegeta's power, which was powered up by using Dende's recovery ability, is no match for him. When Goku arrives after his treatment, he asks him to defeat Frieza and take care of him, and he dies... Finally, the battle between Goku and Frieza begins. However, even the extra-large Genkidama doesn't work on Frieza. However, out of anger that Krillin was killed, Goku transforms into a Super Saiyan!! A fierce battle has begun... At the same time, the Elder and Vegeta were revived by the power of the Dragon Balls and teleported to Earth... The final battle between Goku and Frieza on Planet Namek. Frieza, who is being pushed around by Goku, Frieza, gets impatient and cuts off his torso with his own technique, resulting in a crushing defeat. Goku gives energy to Frieza. However, Frieza cowardly attacks Goku from behind. Frieza was annihilated by Goku's angry blow. However, Goku gets caught up in the collapse of Planet Namek... And a few months later. When Yamcha and his friends are revived, Gohan is informed by Porunga that Goku is safe. Gohan is happy, but for some reason Goku doesn't come back right away...\n\nFear! Frieza ACT 1: Porunga appears!!\n\nA battle for the Dragon Balls on Planet Namek. It was Gohan and the others who were able to summon Super Shenron.\n\nWhile Goku was in the treatment capsule after defeating Ginyu, Dende came to teach them the Dragon Balls' password. Gohan and his friends hide from Vegeta, who fought with the Special Forces, and summon the Super Shenron Porunga. There are three wishes that come true. At the suggestion of Piccolo, who calls from the Kaio Planet, Piccolo is revived first. The God of Earth was revived, and so were the Dragon Balls. He also warps Piccolo to Planet Namek. However, the lifespan of the eldest is...\n\nPorunga's image: I'll make any three wishes come true!!\n\nPlanet Namek's Dragon Balls were large, but Super Shenron was also large. He will also grant three wishes, but he can only bring back dead people one by one.\n\nGohan, Krillin d Dende's image: This will bring everyone back to life!\n\nThe password to summon Super Shenron must be said in Namekian. Both wishes came true, but then Dragon Balls disappeared. The eldest was dead.\n\nFear! Frieza Act ACT 2\n\nA threat with a combat power of 1 million!\n\nFrieza, whose wish for immortality was thwarted, attacked Gohan and the others in a furious rage...!!\n\nVegeta is furious because Gohan and his friends have granted their wishes, but the Dragon Balls disappear right in front of his eyes. Then Frieza appeared there. After defeating the Namekian Nail, Frieza rushes in knowing that Nail was buying time to convey the Dragon Balls' password. Frieza's anger explodes as his wish for immortality is thwarted. Vegeta blocks Frieza's attack, and he urges Frieza to transform. Frieza initiated his first transformation. His fighting power was beyond Vegeta's imagination. Krillin's body is pierced by his horn, and Gohan's death approaches...\n\n2nd form Freeza standing on a rock image: Now then, Which one of you am I going to show hell first?\n\nThe reason he hasn't transformed so far is because his power has become too strong and he can't control it properly. That great power has now been released.\n\nFreeza piercing Krillin image: Is this the end? you foolish pipsqueak Earthling![/b]\n\nFrieza's power has become stronger than they imagined. Krillin can't even move and is pierced by his horn...\n\nFreeza grabbing Gohan's head image: How do you want me to kill you...!?\n\nGohan, angry after Krillin was brutally defeated, challenged Frieza. He hits him with powerful Ki blasts, but it only angers Frieza. Instead, he ends up seriously injured.\n\nDestruction of Planet Vegeta\n\nKing Vegeta, the king of the Saiyans, started a rebellion against Frieza, who was bullying them, but was easily killed. Due to this incident, Frieza destroyed Planet Vegeta, fearing that powerful Saiyans would grow up. Goku's father Bardock was also killed.\n\nFreeza and King Vegeta's image: King Vegeta is Vegeta's father. Frieza defeats King Vegeta with just one blow. The Saiyans were used as Frieza's soldiers.\n\nTerror! Frieza ACT 3: Piccolo Appears\n\nGohan and the others can't do anything about Frieza. Just then, Piccolo rushed in!\n\nJust as he is about to finish off Gohan, Kienzan cuts Frieza's tail. Krillin was revived due to Dende's healing ability. Gohan also recovers and powers up with his Saiyan characteristics! However, they still cannot match Frieza. Just then, Piccolo arrived. Piccolo, who has become assimilated with Nail and obtained ultimate power, challenges Frieza to a one on-one battle. Frieza was skeptical that he was no match for him, but he was surprised by Piccolo's strength. Frieza finally gets serious. Piccolo doesn't give up an inch either. Frieza also begins his second transformation. And he says he has one transformation left. After completing his second transformation, Frieza easily defeats Piccolo.\n\nPiccolo's image: I will defeat Frieza!!\n\nWhen Piccolo warped to Namek using the Dragon Balls, he ended up in a far away location because he didn't specify a location. He finally rushes to help Gohan and his friends.\n\nPiccolo with weights Clashing with 2nd form Freeza image: Realize The Namekian's fury!!\n\nPiccolo boldly challenges Frieza! In order to avenge the enemies of the Namekians who were killed, he will do whatever it takes to defeat Frieza.\n\nPiccolo appearing behind 2nd form Freeza image: When it comes to speed, I win!!\n\nFrieza finally gets serious and fights. Piccolo took off his weighted cloak and turban. The evenly matched battle between the two continues.\n\n3rd form Freeza hlblastimg Piccolo image: The second transformation is in bout!!\n\nAfter completing his second transformation, Frieza surpassed Piccolo in strength. Piccolo is torn to shreds by the rapid fire of Ki bullets. The battle ends with Frieza's overwhelming victory.\n\nAssimilation of Piccolo and Nail\n\nA Namekian can become one by \"assimilating\" with another Namekian. When assimilated, they absorb the other's power and become stronger at once. Although they can acquire the knowledge of the other person they have absorbed, their personalities are never the same. When Piccolo discovers Nail, who has been defeated by Frieza, Nail encourages him to assimilate. It is said that Piccolo, who is separated from the god of the earth, can become stronger than Frieza if he assimilates with the god...\n\nPiccolo fusing with Nail image: Piccolo, please be sure to defeat Frieza\n\nNail assimilated with Piccolo. It seems that Nail's consciousness continues to live on within Piccolo.\n\nTerror! ACT 4: Ultimate! Frieza final transformation\n\nFrieza transforms for the third time and becomes his final form!! The fighting power of Gohan and his friends is no longer even close...\n\nThis is the beginning of real fear...!!\n\nGohan charges in to rescue Piccolo. His full-power Ki blast hits Frieza. The power of the blast was so powerful that even Frieza was stunned, but it was still far from enough. Even so, Frieza feels that the Saiyans need to be annihilated by the increasingly powerful Gohan and Vegeta. To show the overwhelming difference in power, Frieza transformed for the third time and finally assumed his ultimate form. Meanwhile, Vegeta is intentionally half-killed by Krillin and revived. With this, Vegeta should have become the legendary Super Saiyan...\n\nTerror! Frieza ACT 5: Regret...Vegeta's death\n\nVegeta has become a Super Saiyan!? Full of confidence, he challenges Frieza, but the result is a crushing defeat...\n\nAfter completing his transformation, Frieza kills Dende. He realized that Dende had the ability to heal them. Gohan and his friends attempt to challenge Frieza, but their attacks have no effect. Believing that he has become a Super Saiyan, Vegeta challenges Frieza. He is supposed to be the strongest Super Saiyan in the universe, but he is no match for Frieza when he gets serious. Vegeta is in despair due to the vast difference in their abilities. He even cries tears of fear... Vegeta loses the will to resist and is tormented by Frieza. At that moment, Goku rushed in after finishing his treatment. Vegeta, who saw through Goku's ability, tells Frieza that Goku is the Super Saiyan. That was Vegeta's last stand. Frieza pierced Vegeta's heart with a beam of light. As he shed tears of frustration, Vegeta died...\n\nCrying Vegeta image: This is his first time experiencing fear like this\n\nEven with the full power of his Qigong bullet, Frieza deflected it with just a kick. Vegeta sheds tears for the first time in his life due to the vastly different abilities. His true fear and determined despair makes him lose his will to fight.\n\nFreeza kicking Vegeta image: I'm disappointed in you, Vegeta!\n\nFrieza was looking at Vegeta, sensing that he was different from other Saiyans. That's why when he was betrayed, his anger was so great and his attacks so fierce.\n\nFreeza choking Vegeta with his tail image: Is this what a super Saiyan is?\n\nFrieza relentlessly attacks Vegeta, who has no desire to fight anymore. Gohan and Piccolo can't even move due to its ferocity...\n\nVegeta getting shot image: How can I die without even being able to defeat Frieza...!?\n\nVegeta tells Frieza that Goku is the Super Saiyan. That angered Frieza! The beam of light pierces his heart precisely. Vegeta entrusted everything to Goku.\n\nGoku burying Vegeta image: Please take away the Saiyan grudge!!\n\nVegeta sheds tears again, feeling frustrated that Frieza took advantage of him. He asked Goku to \"defeat Frieza with Saiyan hands,\" and he died.\n\nTerror! Frieza ACT 6: Strongest Clash! Goku and Frieza!!\n\nThe battle between Goku and Frieza has finally begun! The biggest decisive battle in the universe, who will win...!?\n\nGoku finally faces Frieza!! Goku fires a Kamehameha from underwater. He uses it as a bait to attack with a kick. Frieza uses his supernatural powers to seal Goku and slams him into the ground. Goku escapes just before the explosion. Freeza attacks without using his hands, but due to Goku's strength, he can't help but punch him. However, Frieza was still using half of his strength, and Goku was using Kaioken 10 times his limit. 20x Kaioken doesn't work against Frieza, and Goku creates a Genkidama. While Piccolo buys time, the giant Genkidama is completed. It hit Frieza directly, but...\n\nGoku and Freeza standing back to back image: The strongest of good and evil, a fierce battle!!\n\nGoku burns with anger as Vegeta's death approaches. The confrontation with the evil Frieza finally begins.\n\nFreeza using supernatural power on Goku image: Is this a supernatural power!? My body can't move\n\nFrieza uses his supernatural powers to move a mountain and smash it into Goku. Goku manages to hold out, but this time his movements are blocked. He is thrown to the ground but escapes with super speed.\n\nGoku punching Freeza image: Your confidence will shatter!!\n\nFrieza declares that he will fight without using both hands, but he is still unable to block Goku's onslaught. Even so, there was still a smile on his face!\n\nGoku creating the Genkidama image: Gather genki, this is the conclusion\n\nNamek, which has few living things, wasn't enough, so he gathered energy from other planets as well. Even with a diameter of 50 meters, it's still not enough to defeat Frieza.\n\nAfter the Ginyu Force\n\nCaptain Ginyu, who has turned into a frog, changes body with Bulma. He aimed for Piccolo's body, but Gohan saw through him and turned him back into a frog. Meanwhile, the dead Recoome and co. somehow appear on Kaio's planet. However, they were defeated by Tenshinhan and the others and fell into hell. Tenshinhan and the others had also become stronger through intense training.\n\nFrog Ginyu changing bodies with Bulma image: Frog Ginyu, along with Bulma and the others, were wrapped to Earth by the Dragon Balls. Since then, he has been living in the pond at his home in Bulma.\n\nTenshinhan VS Jiece and Baata image: Yamcha and Recoome, Chiaotzu and Guldo, Tenshinhan and Jeice & Baata face off.

Goku, enveloped in intense anger, transforms into the legendary Super Saiyan!!\n\nI will never forgive you again!!\n\nThe Genkidama hits Frieza! Goku and his friends celebrate their victory, but Frieza is still alive. He defeats Piccolo in one blow, and then Frieza attacks Krillin. Krillin, who floated in the air with his supernatural powers, exploded into pieces... When Goku saw this, he became extremely angry. His hair stands on end and he emits golden energy, making him a legendary warrior, a Super Saiyan! Goku, who has transformed, shows power that overwhelms Frieza. No one can stop Goku now!!\n\nTerror! Freeza Act 8: Super power!! Angry Son Goku\n\nGoku's anger explodes at Frieza! Frieza tries to blow up Planet Namek...!!\n\nFrieza heads towards Goku, but his attacks don't even make a scratch. Freeza used his techniques to attack Goku. But he didn't get a single scratch. Frieza was furious at his first humiliation. In order to bury Goku along with Planet Namek, Frieza destroys the center of the planet. There are only five minutes left until the explosion. King Kai brought back to life the people killed by Frieza and his friends with Earth's DB. The Elder is also revived, and this time he uses Namek's DB to move everyone to Earth. Gohan and his friends safely return to Earth...\n\nSSjin Goku holding Freeza's hand image: \"You've killed so many blameless people, one after the other!!\"\n\nFrieza tries to shoot Gohan as he leaves with Piccolo. Goku interrupted him. It's amazing power that even Frieza would be surprised by.\n\nSSjin Goku's image: Super Saiyan Son Goku awakens with intense anger!!\n\nA Super Saiyan who has a calm heart but awakens with fierce anger. Because Goku is a kind-hearted Saiyan who grew up on Earth, he was able to transform into a Super Saiyan.\n\nSSjin Goku hitting Frieza's back image: I'm the one who will destroy you!!\n\nFrieza is confident that even if he is a Super Saiyan, there is no way he can lose. However, Goku's fighting power is overwhelming.\n\nSSjin Goku chopping Freeza's back neck image: You piece of scum!!\n\nAs Namek's explosion approaches, Frieza uses his full power to challenge Goku. Once, he rammed his body so hard that Goku was buried deep, but the recoil caused him to lose more and more Ki.\n\nGohan's departure\n\nGohan fought Frieza while Goku was buried underground due to Frieza's ramming. Gohan thought that if he could hold off Frieza until Namek exploded, he could defeat Frieza. It was a sortie in which he was prepared for his own death.\n\nGohan's image: He is rescued by the revived Goku and returns to the escape spaceship. Then he gets warpped to Earth using Namek's DB.\n\nTerror! Frieza Act 9: Freeza’s impatience\n\nThe endless fierce battle between Goku and Frieza! However, the time has finally come to settle the matter...!!\n\nFrieza wishes immortality to the revived Super Shenron. But he didn't say it in Namekian, so he didn't make it. The revived Dende and Vegeta also warp to Earth using the DBs. However, Goku remained on Planet Namek, hoping to settle things with Frieza. During the fight, Goku gradually overwhelms Frieza. Frieza was gradually losing Ki due to the reaction from using his full power. Goku warns Frieza that there is no point in fighting him any further. Frieza, who did not give up, sent a disc of energy flying from behind Goku. However, he was at the mercy of Goku and he severed his own body. Finally, Frieza begs Goku for his life. Goku tries to show his last mercy to Frieza, but...\n\nSSjin Goku and Freeza on the ground image: As expected of a Super Saiyan, the one who will survive is me!\n\nGoku can't live in outer space, so once the planet disappears, it's all over. Frieza knows this and is relieved, but he begins to grow impatient with Goku's strength.\n\nSSjin Goku's image: Frieza, the showdown with you is almost over!\n\nFrieza's techniques no longer work against Goku. Goku warns Frieza, but Frieza doesn't listen.\n\nFreeza getting cut by his own attack image: I'm supposed to be the strongest in the universe...!\n\nAttacks by manipulating disk-shaped energy. However, Frieza, who was at the mercy of Goku's movements, was defeated by his own technique. Goku yelled at him not to stand, but he couldn't make it in time.\n\nSSjin Goku and half body Freeza image: You share your fate with this planet!\n\nAfter Frieza was completely defeated, Goku took care of him. Goku tells him that he should survive and realize the value of life, but Frieza still doesn't give up...\n\nTerror! Freeza Act 10: Victory Strike! Freeza disappears!!!\n\nA tenacious Frieza attacks Goku from behind. Goku's blow obliterates Frieza!\n\nFrieza fires a blast of energy at Goku, whose back is turned. Goku, angered by the cowardly attack, fires a giant Qigong bullet. With this blow, Frieza is finally destroyed and Goku is victorious. However, Goku was caught in the explosion of Planet Namek and died...!? One hundred and thirty days after Planet Namek exploded. Gohan and his friends are happy to learn that Krillin has been revived by Porunga's power, and that Goku is safe and traveling through space. Tenshinhan and the others were revived, and the Namekians also departed for a new planet. Peace has come to the universe.\n\nFreeza's final blast image: I’m the strongest!!\n\nFrieza attacks Goku from behind, believing that he is the strongest in the universe. This is the terrible tenacity of the evil emperor.\n\nSSjin Goku's image: You idiot!!\n\nFreeza’s end image: The end of the emperor!\n\nGoku finally became enraged and delivered a killing blow to Frieza. Frieza was swallowed up by the light and he disappeared...\n\nVariety of DB\n\nAnime version original episode guide 1\n\nOriginal episodes are developments that are exclusive to the anime and are not in the original work.

However, Krillin, who was in love with No. 18, destroyed the controller with his own hands. He tries to let 16 and 18 escape, but they are discovered by Cell, who was defeated by Vegeta.

No. 18 tries to refuse to be absorbed, even if it means blowing herself up. Cell uses No. 17's voice to invite her to join, but No. 18 is not fooled. Cell tries to succeed in absorption by force. But then, Tenshinhan's new kikoho exploded as he prepared to die!!\n\nImperfect Cell appearing behind Android 17 image: \"I'll absorb you!\" Cell emerging from underground\n\nNo. 17 ignores No. 16's warning to run away.

Vegeta and Trunks finally finished their training and came out of the Room of Spirit and Time. Vegeta appears in front of Cell and suddenly transforms into \"Super Vegeta'', which is more than a Super Saiyan, and defeats Cell.

However, even if Vegeta overlooks it, Trunks won't let Cell escape. Meanwhile, Krillin, who has an android emergency stop controller built by Bulma, discovers No. 18 before Cell. However, Krillin, who was in love with No. 18, destroys the controller himself. Vegeta tries to turn Cell into a perfect body, and Trunks tries to stop him. While the two were fighting, Cell finally absorbs No. 18. Cell's power, which evolved into his perfect form, far exceeded that of Super Vegeta.\n\nStrongest! Invincible!!

After confirming Vegeta's rescue, Trunks transforms into a form with even more power than Super Vegeta and confronts Cell! However, this transformation had the drawback that in exchange for power, the increased muscles slowed down his speed. Trunks admits defeat. However, Cell senses the potential for Trunks and Vegeta to become even stronger, and declares that he will hold a martial arts tournament in ten days to settle the matter.\n\nSSjin Grade 3 Trunks' image: I have surpassed my father!!\n\nSSjinG 3 Trunks vs Cell image: I won't let you androids win!!\n\nTrunks transforms into a form with more power than Super Vegeta and fights against Cell.
