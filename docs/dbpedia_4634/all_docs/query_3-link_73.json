I also feel like the satire was a bit more biting in the older titles. Open worlds are also not so unusual these days so it doesn't feel as special.\n\nStrike\n\nOct 25, 2017\n\n28,037\n\nThursday at 2:53 PM\n\n#102\n\nThough I'm definitely over open world games for the most part, nobody makes them like R* does.\n\ngabdeg\n\nOct 26, 2017\n\n6,260\n\nüêù\n\nThursday at 2:53 PM\n\n#103\n\nI was eh on GTA 5 and I hope GTA 6 is more to my tastes. After RDR2 I am somewhat hopeful.\n\nThursday at 2:55 PM\n\n#104\n\nI was over gta but back in this year. And as for others, I am over yakuza and atlus games.\n\nteed\n\nAug 25, 2023\n\n769\n\nThursday at 2:58 PM\n\n#105\n\nYeah. Last I played was about 2 hours of GTA4 roughly when it came out and I found it quite dull and serious (by the standards of the series). Liked RDR, skipped GTAV because I wasn't really playing games at the time, then had the same opinion of RDR2 compared to RDR as I had of GTA4 compared to SA. So I'm not really interested in GTA6 or anything they make next.\n\nevilgenius\n\nDec 12, 2020\n\n561\n\nThursday at 3:00 PM\n\n#106\n\nI want to try gta 6 but gt5 didn't grabbed me. Loved them until 5 but I was younger\n\nDeSolos\n\nNov 14, 2017\n\n611\n\nThursday at 3:11 PM\n\n#107\n\nStarted on San Andreas, and have gone on to play all of the main console games 3 and beyond, and a smattering side games/DLC.\n\nI've enjoyed them all so far, and I'm excited for 6. For me as long as they keep making high quality single player stories I'm in.\n\nNefariousDragon\n\nJan 20, 2024\n\n373\n\nThursday at 3:17 PM\n\n#108\n\nYeah, GTA IV was the beginning of the end for me. A massive change in controls coupled with removal of all the side missions that would get me comfortable with everything, i.e., the taxi/ambulance/police missions. Put an hour or so into and never touched it since.\n\nDid play through almost all of GTA V though but it really only solidified that decision. A very shallow world with a short and uninspiring single player campaign that did nothing for me. Pretty clear the focus on all on the online stuff and can't say I blame them given how much of a cash cow it is.\n\nKenny_Blankenship\n\nJun 1, 2023\n\n1,058\n\nThursday at 3:19 PM\n\n#109\n\nMaybe? Loved all the games up through GTA4 but thought GTA5 was mid. Been long enough that I'm curious about GTA6. Though I do wonder what kind of GTA game R* will make after the kind of success GTA5 saw.\n\nDustyVonErich\n\nOct 31, 2017\n\n2,972\n\nThursday at 3:26 PM\n\n#110\n\nI loved GTA up to San Andreas.\n\nGTA IV was boring for me. Maybe due to being a bit more grounded (for GTA).\n\nGTA V brought me back with the sheer ridiculousness of its story and characters.\n\nI'm looking forward to GTA VI.\n\nmouser\n\nApr 4, 2024\n\n40\n\nThursday at 3:35 PM\n\n#111\n\nGo play saints row 2, that's closest a sandbox game came to San Andreas for me.\n\nShame volition grossly misunderstood the game they were making, kinda shocked to think what the developers actually thought about that game.\n\nI got SR2 at launch specifically because of my disappointment in IV. Better game than IV to me but still doesn't touch San Andreas from a pure gameplay variety and content perspective. The sheer amount of mini-games and the gameplay variety they offer is just off the charts and probably won't ever be matched.\n\nHorns\n\nDec 7, 2018\n\n2,796\n\nThursday at 3:38 PM\n\n#112\n\nGTA is amazing. Same goes for rdr. I play the single player over and over. The online is meh IMO. Rockstar is untouchable in terms of their development. I expect GTA VI to be the best open world game for a decade to come.\n\nAiqops\n\nAug 3, 2021\n\n15,753\n\nThursday at 3:39 PM\n\n#113\n\nNo, I still greatly anticipate new gta and rd games. Literally nothing like it out in the gamesphere.\n\nJ_ToSaveTheDay\n\n\"This guy are sick\" and Corrupted by Vengeance\n\nOct 25, 2017\n\n19,673\n\nUSA\n\nThursday at 3:39 PM\n\n#114\n\nI think GTAV is the only one in the series where the gameplay felt good enough all-around to keep me coming back periodically over the years since its initial release.\n\nI am looking forward to GTA6 on that front (gameplay), but I admit that GTA's storytelling has never really been my thing. I think I appreciate them chasing a tone that largely felt distinct for a while after GTA III, but the various copycats and even its own internal storytelling just kinda felt like it caved under its own weight a bit.\n\nRDR2's storytelling was fantastic though, and if Rockstar has found a way to take that kind of tack and apply it to a modern setting and kinda ditch the mega cynicism of the previous GTAs and manage to strike a good balance of parody and humane drama without going so, so, so sardonic, then I think GTA finally fully realizes itself with 6 for me. So I'm excited, but I say that as someone who only ever really loved the gameplay of V and never really loved the storytelling of any of them.\n\nMisterAnderson\n\nOct 29, 2017\n\n3,622\n\nThursday at 3:42 PM\n\n#115\n\nI've been over GTA, Call of Duty, and Battlefield (military shooters in general), for years now. Might check out GTA VI at some point for the insane visuals, but I haven't played a GTA since GTA 4 and before that I only played the top down versions.\n\nBeast780\n\nJan 28, 2018\n\n436\n\nThursday at 3:42 PM\n\n#116\n\nI want GTA VI but I'm wait and see on how badly Take 2 butchers VI of anything I like in the series in favor of online and microtransactions.\n\nDoctor_Thomas\n\nOct 27, 2017\n\n10,098\n\nThursday at 3:53 PM\n\n#117\n\nGTA IV was OK\n\nGTA V is OK\n\nTechnically impressive, but not that fun to actually play\n\nAdryuu\n\nMaster of the Wind\n\nOct 27, 2017\n\n5,821\n\nThursday at 3:54 PM\n\n#118\n\nFuck GTA and I don't even want another RDR for now. I'll play GTA 6 when it's absurdly cheap or on some sub if I ever feel the need and not follow the story probably, just do shit until I get bored.\n\nHaving played 2, 3 and VC, I skipped high school to go rent San Andreas and play it all morning with some friends at a rehearsal place and then all weekend at home.\n\nI got an Xbox 360 and more or less back into videogames full steam again after getting hyped with some GTA 4 trailers and shit. The game didn't deliver but I finished it. And loved my 360 and eventual ps3.\n\nGot hyped as hell with RDR and it was very nice and even played online with friends.\n\nStill got GTA 5 day one on PS3 and suffered it until the end of the story and many side activities. Much better than 4 in everything but the Euphoria engine use.\n\nRDR2 was the best game by Rockstar I played so far when I got it day one and played for months (also even online). Had my fill.\n\nNot anymore. Saw the trailer for 6, zero hype, found it disgusting even. Much more exciting games to look forward to personally.\n\nThursday at 4:01 PM\n\n#119\n\nWhen I was a kid, I played and enjoyed greatly GTA2, GTA3 and GTA: Vice City. But San Andreas didn't captivate me enough, and after that I fell out of gaming, so missed 4 and 5.\n\nI do want to play GTA6 eventually, since it likely be an important piece of media, but probably when it is ~$10-15. Honestly outside of production values and sheer scale, I don't really expect them to do anything super interesting, so if there is something really innovating, I might change my mind.\n\nPetruccis Biceps\n\nOct 27, 2017\n\n4,586\n\nThursday at 4:01 PM\n\n#120\n\nNah I'm just over GTA fucking 5.\n\nGTA5 came out almost 11 years ago. For perspective, there was 7 mainline Asscreed games(8 if you include Rogue) since it originally came out and there will be another when Asscreed Shadows comes out later this year.\n\nI know 5 is a money maker but I'm so fucking tired of it.\n\nBig Powder\n\nOct 25, 2017\n\n1,250\n\nThursday at 4:03 PM\n\n#121\n\nI adore them. I'm hoping for something closer to IV than V, though. The first trailer didn't give me much hope, as it just looks like a continuation of V's vibe, but we'll see once we finally start to get more of a glimpse at the game's overall tone and gameplay. As much as I enjoyed V, I think they have more potential doing a somewhat serious crime drama over something a lot wackier. Sam Houser always said he hadn't seen The Sopranos because he knew he would start trying to emulate it, and although I understand his perspective, I actually wish he would. That's the kind of tone I'd love a GTA game to have.\n\nThursday at 4:04 PM\n\n#122\n\nI literally have only ever enjoyed Vice City because of the 80s theming, so I've been \"over\" GTA basically forever.\n\nCaveGhostPurp\n\nJan 12, 2022\n\n821\n\nThursday at 4:26 PM\n\n#123\n\nFor GTA, the last one I liked was San Andreas. Haven't cared about the series at all since then, so I'd say I'm over it. But 1, 3, and SA got a lot of play out of me when I was a kid.\n\nMortal Kombat is another franchise I used to love, all the way up until 9. 9 was awesome, the absolute peak of the (mainline) series for me. X started letting me down during the roster-reveal process. Most of my favs weren't there, and I didn't like the new characters either. Still, I bought it randomly when I saw it on sale for like $20 later. Played through it once with Sub-Zero and never touched the game again. Didn't like the boost in speed X had over 9, too, on top of the disappointing roster.\n\nHonestly, the only thing I want from MK now is a port of Shaolin Monks.\n\nAztechnology\n\nCommunity Resettler\n\nOct 25, 2017\n\n14,514\n\nThursday at 4:28 PM\n\n#124\n\nI usually enjoy GTA's story but V's multiplayer while at first fun with heists lost me as they focused on just filling it out with the more sandboxy or standard competitive and less coop elements.\n\nRunning around griefing people, I have little interest in. In any game.\n\nHippopuncher12\n\nOct 25, 2017\n\n16,680\n\nCincinnati\n\nThursday at 4:28 PM\n\n#125\n\nThe last GTA I played from start to finish was Vice City, so I guess so lol. SA was good, but I never got through it. Hated 4, I liked 5 but got bored rather quickly.\n\nVito\n\nOne Winged Slayer - Formerly Undead Fantasy\n\nOct 25, 2017\n\n16,882\n\nThursday at 4:30 PM\n\n#126\n\nI was never in.\n\nThe only game I played more than a few minutes was VCS and I never finished it.\n\nLowrys\n\nOct 25, 2017\n\n13,091\n\nLondon\n\nThursday at 4:34 PM\n\n#127\n\nIt's always had horrible gameplay for me, so I fell off a while ago. Insane production values, a fucking chore to play, and school-grade writing. Also I don't play online.\n\nCecil\n\nChicken Chaser\n\nOct 25, 2017\n\n3,627\n\nThursday at 5:04 PM\n\n#128\n\nAbsolutely not.\n\nI thought GTAIV was pretty crap, but GTAV is a brilliant game, that I've played through twice, and could replay again. It's a standout title alongside RDR2 in the open world action game genre, and I've never felt the boredom or feeling of gameplay being chores in them.\n\nAnd I've never understood people comparing games like the mediocre Saints Row games with games like GTAV.\n\nThe only issue I have with the series is that GTAVI doesn't have a PC version announced, and you can count on a PC version being needed to get an acceptable framerate for the game.\n\nGonzoCR\n\nOct 28, 2017\n\n330\n\nThursday at 5:22 PM\n\n#129\n\nOnly ever played actually GTAV (played GTAIV occasionally at friends' houses, but that was just taking turns killing people and trying to stay alive for as long as possible), and I actually enjoyed it and played the story all the way through like 3 times, but I came back like a year later and just moving the characters around felt absolutely awful to the point I wondered how I played it so much in the first place. Played some missions and the insanely restrictive design really started to bother me (it really feels like you turn left when the game wants you to turn right and back to the last checkpoint). It completely killed any desire I had to play RDR2, which from all I've read about it doesn't change any of those issues, and as a consequence I also don't really care about GTAVI at all. I'm sure it will sell gangbusters but only way I would play it is if I got it for free.\n\nyallasama\n\nDec 7, 2022\n\n353\n\nThursday at 5:24 PM\n\n#130\n\nDefinitely still some love there, but they have to win me back over. 4 and 5 both had big flaws that kept me from enjoying them outside of doing the story and the occasional side mission, just driving around etc. Mafia is still the best 3D open world crime and car game, but by the looks of it GTA6 finally might become what I envisioned GTA always could and should've been: more grounded, less reliant on the parody on America and silly jokes, more authentic and real-to-life in its driving, the city it's based on, the things you have to do and can do to live life, complete missions in all kinds of creative ways, the police response, jail and or prison system and less of a rags to riches story, which GTA5 partially already did. Playing as a woman should also really add a new element to the game. The only way this game could really let me down if it's still the same old GTA, but more realistic graphically and actual life-like gore. I don't need to see intestines, shredded arms and other body parts accurately reacting to being hit with a bullet / sharp object etc. That could really turn me off, though I might just drive around the city since it's the only game I expect to have next gen graphics in an open world where you can just explore any part you want as you would in real life.\n\nZoidn\n\nDec 23, 2018\n\n1,777\n\nThursday at 5:27 PM\n\n#131\n\nAbsolutely not. I recently caught a glimpse of a Vice City stream on Twitch and my brain immediately went \"You know what you need? A new GTA game!\"\n\nVery excited for GTA6, whenever it may come to PC.\n\nXyer\n\nAug 26, 2018\n\n7,861\n\nThursday at 5:27 PM\n\n#132\n\nI'm probably over 3D Zelda games if they're just going to be BOTW like from now on. Not my kinda Zelda game.\n\nantitrop\n\nOct 25, 2017\n\n13,340\n\nThursday at 5:27 PM\n\n#133\n\nAlways been one of my favorite series since the first one. I'm still super excited for GTAVI, but a little curious how it will turn out without people like Leslie Benzies or Dan Houser involved.\n\nMajin Boo\n\nOct 26, 2017\n\n1,488\n\nThursday at 5:32 PM\n\n#134\n\nYeah but that's been the case for quite a while. Vice City was the last one I really loved. I think it's mostly a gameplay issue for me, as much as I love Rockstars open worlds, their gameplay just doesn't give me anything.\n\nTransEuropaExpress\n\nDec 6, 2017\n\n11,197\n\nUS\n\nThursday at 5:41 PM\n\n#135\n\nRockstar mission design made me out of GTA4 already. Haven't liked a Rockstar game since with RDR2 being peak \"what the fuck are these missions!?\". Not my cup anymore at all.\n\nAntipode\n\nJul 25, 2019\n\n454\n\nThursday at 5:43 PM\n\n#136\n\nI've played my fill of all current GTA games and don't feel the need to return (though I might make an exception someday for Vice City). I'm willing to try 6.\n\nKeldroc\n\nOct 27, 2017\n\n12,298\n\nThursday at 5:46 PM\n\n#137\n\nI was 'over it' because they only had 1 new game in about 15 years.\n\nIt's this, plus their refusal to evolve their humor past early 00's edgelord, plus their decision to gut the heist stuff out of 5's story and transplant it to GTA Online really soured me on the entire thing. I'm interested to see what they pull off in 6, but in comparison to my excitement for, say, San Andreas or 4? Not even close.\n\nIztok\n\nOct 27, 2017\n\n6,441\n\nThursday at 5:59 PM\n\n#138\n\nno, GTA is forever.\n\nThere hasn't been a time, since GTA1 on PC (not PS1, PC), that I didn't see it as the absolute pinnacle of gaming.\n\nI can't imagine this changing with GTA6, from what I've seen.\n\nAnd btw I only play through the single player portion.\n\nThursday at 6:56 PM\n\n#139\n\nI've always found GTA kind of cringe and juvenile. I played bits of Vice City, San Andreas and GTA4 at friends' houses as a teenager. I had fun, but never enough to want to get them myself. GTA5 was the first to release while I was an adult. Once again, played a fair bit at friends' houses but it felt very obvious by then it wasn't a game for me beyond a social thing to mess around with.\n\nI fully respect the level of polish and depth of the systems they have though, so I'm looking forward to GTA6 to hear people talk about it (especially Digital Foundry). But it would take a lot to convince me to buy it. I won't say never though. I quite like RDR1 and 2, so Rockstar definitely has potential to appeal to my tastes. It would need some more mature writing from them, though.\n\nAs for other series, I played every COD from COD4 through MW3 (the original) quite religiously. I mostly played them for their campaigns and various horde/zombies modes, and only rarely dabbled in the multiplayer. I felt Infinity Ward in particular were great at designing action set-pieces, so that was the main draw for me. Tried BLOPS2 and got burnt out halfway through the campaign and never finished it, which is a rarity for me as I almost always force myself to finish games. Haven't touched a COD since, beyond playing a lot of split-screen Zombies for Infinite Warfare with my housemate a few years ago. Do they still make split-screen for those? That's probably the only thing I'd come back for now.\n\nSimilar thing happened with AC. Played 1 through Revelations and really enjoyed them, but was getting a little fatigued on the formula by the end of Revelations. Started AC3 and knew within 2 hours I just had no interest in continuing. Gave the game away, and then Black Flag came out and looked awesome, so I picked up a cheap second-hand copy of AC3 to try again. I couldn't bring myself to skip AC3 and go straight to Black Flag, but I also couldn't bring myself to play AC3 either. Never ended up touching it, and then reviews for the next few games didn't seem great so I just never came back to the series. Considered jumping back in on either Origins or Odyssey multiple times, and then I hear about how bloated they are and I know that's my least favourite type of open world game. If I'm going to do that to myself, I'd much rather replay The Witcher 3 and at least know I'm getting a more interesting world to immerse myself in.\n\nOther than those, sports games. I played a lot of FIFA, NBA 2K and Madden NFL, but haven't touched any of them in over 8 years, except for the very rare occasion at a friends' house (and even then, not since 2020).\n\ntexhnolyze\n\nShinra Employee\n\nOct 25, 2017\n\n24,118\n\nIndonesia\n\nThursday at 7:01 PM\n\n#140\n\nI've never been a GTA fan, even since a kid.

I'm curious how much the writing quality of RDR2 carries over to 6, as I do feel like it's satire is just too close to reality nowadays for me to care much for it.\n\nI wish we still got GTA Clones, would scratch that itch for me.\n\nFirefly\n\nJul 10, 2018\n\n8,834\n\nThursday at 7:21 PM\n\n#143\n\nWas eh on it, still eh on them.\n\nCampaigns are decent campy fun but I don't play them very often beyond that.\n\nThursday at 7:22 PM\n\n#144\n\nHad fun with GTA2, loved San Andreas, thought GTA4 was a chore. Never even bothered with GTA5.\n\nIt's not just the gameplay but more the tone that alienates me these days. I hear they took the transphobic shit out of GTA5 at least? But I don't need Rockstar's brand of social satire in my life anymore.\n\nThursday at 7:49 PM\n\n#145\n\nI still like GTA, but I loved it as a teenager. GTA San Andreas was peak hype for me, but I continue to play all the mainline games and fully expect to play GTA VI as well (will probably wait to get it on sale though).\n\nOther series I used to like and am no longer into:\n\n- Batman Arkham series ‚Äî played and enjoyed the first two and decided I had had enough\n\n- Assassin's Creed series ‚Äî enjoyed the first game, played a bit of II and fell off after that. Many years later, I tried IV, but quickly got bored and decided the series isn't for me anymore.\n\n- New Super Mario Bros series ‚Äî I've played all of them and each one was a disappointment compared to Super Mario World and Super Mario Bros 3. I was ready to give up on the \"New\" games, but Nintendo had a return to form with Super Mario Bros Wonder\n\nPyro\n\nGod help us the mods are making weekend threads\n\nJul 30, 2018\n\n15,406\n\nUnited States\n\nThursday at 7:50 PM\n\n#146\n\nKinda. GTA Online hooked my friends and I for years until MTX got out of hand. And I honestly was never high on the games until GTA V (first one I beat) despite liking them well enough. But a fresh start is so damn exciting, so no, I'm not over GTA.\n\nFjordson\n\nOct 25, 2017\n\n5,128\n\nThursday at 7:56 PM\n\n#147\n\nDefinitely not. A new GTA is still a uniquely amazing experience. Not much else like it in gaming.\n\ndefaltoption\n\nOct 27, 2017\n\n11,719\n\nAustin\n\nThursday at 7:56 PM\n\n#148\n\nKinda but only because I enjoyed the more serious nature of the games prior to 5 and what we get in the Red Dead franchise. They were silly but grounded. 5 and Online are just a bit too wacky and about the jokes for me and based on their success I can't see that changing.\n\nI'm excited for 6 don't get me wrong I'll be there day 1 but I'd be more excited for a dead space level remake of prior games such as 4. That shitty remaster trilogy was terrible.\n\nBut yeah, in 5 and online it feels like the satire is the point whereas before imo the satire was in addition.\n\nparaluman\n\nAug 5, 2024\n\n86\n\nThursday at 8:14 PM\n\n#149\n\nNot GTA but Nintendo produced games, outside of their rpgs, for me. Or maybe it's just because how 'old' Switch is tech-wise at this point"
