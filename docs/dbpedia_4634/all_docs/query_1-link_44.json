        "text": "Shenron can only do things that its creator (Kami or Dende) can do. Kami and Dende cannot kill Buu and Cell, as they're much weaker than them.\n\nThe dragon can't kill anyone beyond its creator's power.\n\nOf course, they could have warped vegeta and nappa t a sun or something\n\nReally ... I never knew that the Balls had a power limit.\n\nlearn something new everyday\n\nMaybe he only knows Yardrat teleportation, meaning he can't teleport someone to the sun because there's no Ki on the sun to lock onto\n\nYeah that seems like a loophole that could easily be overridden.\n\nPlus there's a factor of choice. Didn't they try wishing for Goku to be teleported back to Earth, but he refused?\n\nEdit: I looked it up, yes. Vegeta and Nappa probably could have resisted the wish.\n\nOh, and also remember that the afterlife is a bureaucracy. Things don't happen automatically, you got to go through the paperwork and procedures and stuff. Sometimes people like Kami and King Yemma pull the strings to go around procedures.\n\nYup, this is one of the most important things in DBZ cosmogony. It's not like Christianism where \"good\" and \"evil\" are absolute concepts. In DBZ it's just the heavenly bureaucracy that decides who's good and who's evil. When Kid Buu started to threaten the very existence of the universe itself, the bureaucracy needed Vegeta's help, so they got him to help regardless of whether he's good or bad.\n\nIt's been awhile since i've seen the anime or read the manga all the way through but from what i remember, if we only go by the canonical stuff, then it has never been implied that the reason for Goku getting to keep his body was because he was a good person. Kami transferred it to the afterlife in the Saiyan arc after the fight with Raditz and the only reason Goku had a body for a second time was because he himself teleported himself to Kaio so that Cell wouldn't blow up the earth. What he did during his lifetime had nothing to do with it. Although the anime does create some inconsistencies with the manga in regards to how the afterlife works.\n\nIt's stated at the end of the Cell Saga when they attempt to bring him back. After the bit about him attracting trouble, Goku says that evil and normal people lose their bodies, but he will get to keep his and train against the greatest martial artists in history without aging due trying to save the world.\n\nVegeta had his chance at redemption through all the Freeza stuff. Then he finally gets his blonde hair and he suddenly thinks he's invincible. Then when Goku and Gohan both show him that he's not anything special, he vows to never fight again. Then he quickly showed that he's just a jealous baby, not just a tortured villain doomed to the wrong path. He gets partial credit for admitting Goku is better than him at the end of the Buu saga though.\n\nOne thing that irritated me. Everyone was freaking out about Gohan being dead in the Buu arc, but 5 minutes before they started crying over this, they had wished back everyone who had been killed today, so even if Gohan was dead, he should have been brought back to life.\n\nDon't they have to wait a year before the can call Shenron again? By then, everyone would have been dead if Buu had won.\n\nIf I remember correctly Shenron can bring back people only once but he can also bring back multiple people with a single wish. Porunga can bring back people infinitely but only one person per wish, so a maximum of 3 people once you summon his Dragon Balls.\n\nVegeta was revived by Shenron when the people on Earth asked him to bring back all people killed by Frieza on Namek. Because he was brought back already he can't be revived again except by Porunga who is on the New Namek planet. Or some shit I dunno...\n\nShenron can only do things that its creator (Kami or Dende) can do.\n\nSo then Kami and Dende must be able to bring back dead people too right? Then why have a magic Dragon in the first place?\n\nProbably stuck in a loop of training and reaching new heights, followed by Goku immediately farting out a new power level even better. Or a world where Goku is king of all saiyans\n\nSo... life as normal then.\n\nAh, so everything after Vegeta's sacrifice is in fact just us watching his version of hell.\n\nIn reality, Gohan probably cleanly defeated Buu, Goku continues to be a deadbeat dad in otherworld, Krillin defeats Jiren.\n\nIt's a world where things make a bit more sense.\n\nI gotta admit, making Goku eat a spirit bomb to unlock UI just to remind Vegeta of his failed zenkai boost strategy is a devilishly nice touch.\n\nSuper didn't overwrite this at all, it simply added the fact that repentance for one's crimes is what comes before your soul is purified and made into someone else. Frieza hasn't repented, so he's stuck where he is.\n\nThere is some really awesome fanart someone did of Kid Buu in the afterlife, and I wish I could find it....fits with the whole \"repenting\" theme.\n\nFound it. Sorry so large. I really love this work. Wish I knew who did it.\n\nOn the teleportation thing, actually, has Dragon Ball ever defined how \"powerful\" stars are? If we got characters who can zap planets out of existence, how much more power would it take to destroy a star? During the Saiyan Saga maybe there's at least a chance someone like Vegeta and Nappa would just brush off being teleported into the sun. Then again, as powerful as they are, they still can't survive the vacuum of space, and I imagine their space ships can't survive being close to a star, or maybe they can. Who knows. You could also ask why Shenron couldn't just teleport them to the complete other side of the universe to push back the clock.\n\nIt's clear Toriyama didn't really cover all his bases here.\n\nOn the teleportation thing, actually, has Dragon Ball ever defined how \"powerful\" stars are?

Of course there was Vegeta who was teleported instantly back to earth before he knew what was going on.\n\nWho knows how it works it's all bullshit.\n\nWhat? If they can make a dragon with powers greater than their own, then make a dragon that can kill anyone.\n\nNope, that's not how the DBverse works. Killing someone who doesn't want to be killed is different than reviving someone who wants to revive. As was said above, you can't even revive someone who doesn't want to revive (Goku at the end of the Cell saga).\n\nOn the teleportation thing, actually, has Dragon Ball ever defined how \"powerful\" stars are?
