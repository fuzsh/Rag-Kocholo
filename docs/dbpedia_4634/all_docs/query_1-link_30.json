        "text": "Post by Jason9000 on\n\nI'd say up until XXI made Vegito disappear he would let things play out just for the fun. Unless Vegito went to explain what happened to the Vargas I doubt they would do much. If anything they would try to send Buu and Vegito back for leaving the arena and fighting off planet, while not in an actual match. But, Buu would pull the same shit he did when Broly fought Vegito and make the machine not work. Thus making it absolute chaos. I doubt even Gast would be able to stop him using the same trick; however, we don't know if Buu becoming stronger would negate Gast's magic. Now that I think about it, was it ever explained how the Vargas are able to send everyone back at the flip of a switch? Like did they administer a shot to everyone that has some nanites that respond to the machine by the announcers? I honestly can't remember if Salagir addressed this.\n\nPost by Deleted on\n\nJason9000\n\nIt wasn't explained how the Vargas can teleport anyone back to their universe except for the remote control that the Varga supervisor of each universe possesses. The Varga supervisor of the U18 space explained its functions but not how it functions to U18 Gohan. Your theory of injecting nanites into the contestants and spectators makes sense. My guess is that they take a DNA sample of each competitor (I can't explain what would be the case for Buu) during the registration process and program the teleportation device to work on people possessing the exact DNA structure as the sample.\n\nPost by Deleted on\n\nI think Buu would have went mad eventually. Basically a more retarded strong, steroids-infested and OP Adult Kid Buu.\n\nPretty much this, or at least until the constant rising of power maybe kills him somehow? Imagine Buu chucking a tanty at the same time he scored an increase in power, he'd bloody explode.\n\nEndgame would have the Vargas returning Buu and he would likely live out his remaining days constantly having to reabsorb Broly until it gets to the point he is incapable of subduing Broly, in which Buu will be obliterated with Broly suiciding along with the galaxy (not universe, fuck that shit, it annoys me hearing that) not too long afterwards.\n\nPost by The Retro Kakarotto on\n\nCan't tell if Buu would have a greater desire to murder \"KAKAROTTO!!!\" or greater desire to absorb Son Goku. Hm...Tough call.\n\nIirc, ZBuu's appearance after that \"GOTTA ABSORB BROLY\" shtick was the first night time scene, (the one where he told Frieza Ginyu is aboard) so he'd probably do the same thing for that scene. However, S Kaioshin and U11 Buu's match was before Vegito and XXI, so I'm thinking Vegito would sneak U4 Buu away and try to separate Broly from Buu. (\"A being absorbed for too long is no longer releasable.\")\n\nSince this is Salagir, he'd probably display a successful Vegito, separate Broly from Buu, and the rest of the story resumes as normal, except with a slightly more pissed off Buu than when he initially got curbstomped by his and Vegito's first encounter.\n\nPost by Gogeta on\n\nCan't tell if Buu would have a greater desire to murder \"KAKAROTTO!!!\" or greater desire to absorb Son Goku.

For one he'd have to be absorbed by Buu with his shield up to get that chance, a mistake Buu is unlikely to make. In terms of power alone Zen Buu plus Broly overpowers Vegito except barring his SSJ3 and considering Vegito can only maintain SSJ3 for seconds, Buu should have no issue outlasting him.\n\nThe only hope of separating Broly and Buu provided an absorption was successful is if, due to Broly still being in a cocoon inside Buu and not fully absorbed to the point where he becomes a part of Buu's essence is if the Vargas's teleportation back to his own Universe can work from inside Buu.\n\nPost by Son Pan on\n\nIt is the Legendary Super Saiyan form though. Are we sure Majin Buu could successfully absorb it? It is possible the invincibility ability prevents Buu's body from successfully breaking it down and absorbing its power. That ability could potentially make it impossible for Buu to fully absorb Broly. Or if he can there might be some drawback that prevents Buu from being able to fully control his body. Not even Raichi's ghost technology can control Broly for long. Majin Buu might be magical, but it is possible the LSS form is too much for Buu to control and he goes on a mindless rampage as his original personality is re-written to match Broly's. He is basically goes back to being Kid Buu. Or perhaps the power is too much for Buu's body to adjust and he destroys himself.\n\nAll in all I think the Zen Buu/Hyper Buu of U4 that we all love would be dead as we know it.\n\nPost by Axalon on\n\nI agree with the thoughts that Buu would've just gone crazy. Given that even Raichi/Hatchy's Ghost technology couldn't control a dead Broly for more than a couple of minutes I see Buu going down the same path. I think Buu would've lasted a bit longer though, and definitely would've gotten a lot more sadistic before just going off the rails, kinda like how Broly was in the first movie compared to meme Broly.\n\nPost by Eldagusto on\n\nWhat does Zen Buu want though? Besides entertainment and an abstract desire to grow. I mean if I knew of a desire besides absorbing for absorbing's sake Broly would probably be an insanely helpful stepping stone. I'm guessing Buu has pretty damn well analyzed the Vargas Tech, but the Gods are putting some sort of Seal of 5 Divinities on the Omniverse, so Buu seems to be Plateauing as God. Shouldn't he be Creating life somewhere? Could the Dragonballs pierce the Multiverse Seal? Buu could also ask for specific powers he doesn't have from the Dragonballs perhaps, such as asking for Time Travel Powers, or if he can't he can ask for Time Travel Tech.\n\nPost by Conqueror Geng on\n\nWhat does Zen Buu want though?

Many other scientists throughout the cosmos which were absorbed by Buu may have converged upon similar ideas of time travel, so upon absorbing them Buu would be able to use their memories to also create more efficient time machines since those scientists may have come from races with higher technological levels than humans."
