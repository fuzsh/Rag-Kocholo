Combined with his regeneration, Buu's survivability makes him extremely difficult to kill.\n\nTransfiguration Beam: This attack can actually change any object besides of chocolate or person into any type of object regardless of their strength. However, upon transformation, strong opponents can retain enough power to attack. The user usually announces what the attack will turn the victim into before using it.\n\nVaporize!: Innocent Buu throws his arms forward and fires a bluish-green energy wave against the opponent. He then charges more power into the energy wave, changing it into a giant energy sphere that blasts the opponent away, inflicting huge damage.\n\nHealing: Buu is able to heal users of wounds and diseases. Such as being able to heal broken legs, gunshot wounds, and cure blindness.\n\nTelekinesis: A technique that allows the user to manipulate objects and other people with the power of one's mind.\n\nIII Flash: First, Buu opens his mouth and charges a pink energy sphere with additional streaks of black and pink electricity. Then, he fires the energy sphere from his mouth in the form of a narrow, pink energy wave at the opponent, inflicting a high amount of damage.\n\nPotbelly Attack: Buu grabs his belly and yanks off a piece of it, manipulating the skin to turn it into a long cylindrical piece. The skin suddenly comes alive, and he can use it as a weapon.\n\nAngry Explosion: Majin Buu crosses his arms on his chest and charges a vibrating pink energy sphere around his body. Then, he looks up and shouts, \"Big power!\" with a deep voice. Finally, Majin Buu says, \"Me mad now!\" and unleashes an explosion of pink energy across an incredibly wide range, destroying everything caught in its path.\n\nVanishing Beam: A simple pink, perfectly round beam fired from the palm of the hand.\n\nEnjoy Browning: The user fires pink energy spheres from both hands at their opponent.\n\nMajin Kamehameha: A powerful Ki blast fired with two hands after concentrating a large amount of Ki.\n\nChoke Hold: The hold used by Buu to stop Babidi from using the Sealing Spell.\n\nSupre Breath: The user inhales deeply, and then exhales creating a huge gust of wind similar to a hurricane.\n\nFlame Shower Breath: First, the user inhales a large amount of air and strongly exhales it, creating a huge gust of wind similar to a hurricane that can level a city.\n\nInnocence Express: Innocent Buu yells out \"Ready, set, go!\" in a humorous way, because he says it very fast. He then charges by running into his target using his whole body. His legs move very fast, making it impossible to see them (only two pink waves are shown). He would eventually slow down.\n\nProtective Bubble: Majin Buu conjures a force field bubble around him when the Earth's military forces try to destroy him.\n\nFission: The ability for a single being to split into two different copies of himself, divided more or less equally in terms of power and appearance, but usually share a single lifeline.\n\nExplosive Buu Buu Punch: First, Innocent Buu appears in front of the opponent and punches them away. Then, he proceeds to assault the opponent with a nearly endless barrage of more heavy punches, inflicting a large amount of damage.\n\nFlight: The ability to fly with the use of ki.\n\nKi Blast:The most basic form of energy wave.\n\nMimicry: The coveted ability to copy another fighter's technique after seeing it used only once.\n\nAbsorption: Innocent Buu engulfs a victim completely or using a part of his body to suck the victim into his body, thus gaining their power and abilities.\n\nBody Manipulation: An ability that allows the user to freely manipulate his/her own body structure.\n\nRegeneration: The ability to regrow certain body parts or cells that have been dismembered or destroyed and replace them with brand new cells, or simply regrouping all of their separated parts back together.\n\nSurvivability: Like Frieza and Cell, the other iterations of Majin Buu, Buu has the ability to survive anywhere, in any condition without sustenance, even the most horrifying injuries.
