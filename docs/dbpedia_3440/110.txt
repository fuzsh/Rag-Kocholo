Project description

It includes an immersed tube tunnel crossing of the Sydney Harbour between Birchgrove and Balls Head, tunnelled ramps and surface connections at Rozelle, North Sydney and Cammeray, future underground connections to the Beaches Link and Gore Hill Freeway, the fit-out of and commission of ventilation outlets and motorway facilities at the Rozelle Interchange, in Cammeray and in North Sydney.

The immersed tunnel has a length of 650 m (5 tunnel elements), has 2 times 3 lanes with a central gallery widening towards the transition structures. The maximum depth at the South side amounts 30 m. 3 out of the 5 tunnel elements are fully founded in rock and 2 elements are partly founded in very soft sediments. To cope with the differential foundation conditions an additional internal immersion is pre-installed in the middle of a tunnel element which would allow for large rotations after immersion. Two other segment joints are equipped with special water stops to allow for slightly larger rotations. These, among other, design optimalisation allowed for differential settlements in longitudinal direction and therewith permitted the upward shift of the vertical alignment reducing the construction costs.

The immersed tube transits at the shore to the mined road header tunnels. The special transition structure is constructed out of the mined tunnels without surface access limiting nuisance at surface level.
