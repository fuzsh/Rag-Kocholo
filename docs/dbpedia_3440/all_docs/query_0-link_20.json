        "text": "“Nighttime” Images Glaciers, Water\n\nLandsat 8 normally images all Earth landmasses…\n\n80.93\n\n-61.2577\n\nPetermann Glacier, Greenland Off 3094\n\nLandsat 8 normally images all Earth landmasses every 16 days. However, at high latitudes, there is considerable overlap because Landsat 8’s orbital tracks converge at the Poles. As a result, this increases the temporal frequency of Landsat 8 coverage over northern Greenland.\n\nBuilding on this imaging overlap, Landsat 8 takes advantage of long hours of daylight in the Arctic to acquire “nighttime” sunlit images, increasing temporal coverage even more. The two Landsat 8 images were acquired a little over 3 hours apart, one on its descending orbit and one ascending. Having multiple images increases the chances of acquiring more cloud-free images and helps scientists monitor iceberg calving events.\n\n2010 Ice Break Glaciers, Water\n\nScientists observed rifts in Petermann Glacier…\n\n80.93\n\n-61.2577\n\nPetermann Glacier, Greenland Off 3089\n\nScientists observed rifts in Petermann Glacier throughout the first decade of the 2000s. The rift that caused the 2010 break was first spotted in satellite imagery in 2001. See below for the location of this rift in a 2001 Landsat image.\n\nThe massive calving event in 2010 removed 28 kilometers of the ice shelf. The result was an ice island four times the size of Manhattan, about 270 square kilometers. It was the largest iceberg to form in the Arctic since 1962.\n\nThe last image displayed in this section shows a size comparison of Manhattan Island (yellow outline) to the iceberg.\n\n(Black stripes run through the images because of the Scan Line Corrector failure on Landsat 7 in May 2003.)\n\n2012 Break Glaciers, Water\n\nJust two years later, another large iceberg…\n\n80.93\n\n-61.2577\n\nPetermann Glacier, Greenland Off 3090\n\nJust two years later, another large iceberg broke off Petermann Glacier. This one was estimated at 130 square kilometers—about half the size of the 2010 iceberg. But this calving broke off the glacier tongue farther upstream and moved the front end of the glacier farther inland than has been observed since 1876, the first reported measurements of the glacier.\n\nThe floating ends of glaciers like Petermann are known as ice shelves. They act as doorstops. When these ice shelves suddenly splinter and weaken, the glaciers that feed them speed up. The result is more ice flowing into the ocean, which could raise global sea levels.\n\nThe development of these icebergs is a natural process; however, when there are two major breaks in two years, scientists must take notice. Even large breaks do not amount to a collapse of the floating extension; nevertheless, they are important events.\n\n(Black stripes run through the images because of the Scan Line Corrector failure on Landsat 7 in May 2003.)\n\n2017 Rift Glaciers, Water\n\nA new rift formed on Petermann Glacier in 2017…\n\n80.93\n\n-61.2577\n\nPetermann Glacier, Greenland Off 3093\n\nA new rift formed on Petermann Glacier in 2017. An older crack to the right of the new rift also extends toward the glacier’s center. By 2020, this new rift had met up with the older crack. If an iceberg breaks off, it would be Petermann’s third massive iceberg calving since 2010. It also could place the new calving face much farther upstream than the 2010 break.\n\nClose-up images from Sentinel-2 take advantage of its 10-meter spatial resolution to show the new rift in greater detail. Landsat 8 and Sentinel-2 complement each other by imaging glacial movement and possible calving events.\n\nThe prominent vertical line could be from deformation of the ice as it flows over the bedrock farther upstream. The irregular topographic surface of the underlying bedrock could have caused the ice to develop this longitudinal crevasse as it moved over bedrock, resulting in a line being drawn the length of the glacier as it flows. Besides the new rift, other bumps and lines extend from this longitudinal line, which are stress fractures from the glacial movement.\n\nAlong with becoming longer, notice that the rifts are also moving downstream between 2017 and 2022 as the glacier flows.\n\n2018 Eruption Coasts, Natural-Disasters\n\nOn April 30, 2018, rapid changes in the East…\n\n19.388\n\n-155.106\n\nKīlauea, Hawaii, USA Off 3168\n\nOn April 30, 2018, rapid changes in the East Rift Zone were detected. The Pu‘u ‘Ō‘ō crater floor collapsed. Ground deformation toward the east indicated magma intrusion approaching the Leilani Estates neighborhood, 20 km from Pu‘u ‘Ō‘ō.\n\nBased on numerous geological, geochemical, and geophysical instruments, the USGS Hawaiian Volcano Observatory and other scientists determined that magma had drained from below Pu‘u ‘Ō‘ō crater. It then intruded through underground tunnels and emerged at eruptive vents, or fissures, in the lower East Rift Zone.\n\nOn May 3, the first of 24 fissures along a 6-km line opened within Leilani Estates. Fissure 8 became the dominant vent on May 28. It shot lava tens of meters into the air and sent a vigorous flow toward the coast, ultimately entering the ocean near the eastern tip of the island.\n\nThis series of images shows the progression of the lava flows throughout the summer of 2018. Clouds often obscure views of the island, but numerous observations from Landsat, Sentinel-2, and Resourcesat offered peeks through the clouds to the location of fresh lava. Some of the images also show “laze.” When lava mixes with seawater, it creates a noxious gas plume that looks like clouds or smoke. The word is a blend of the words lava and haze. Laze can cause skin and eye irritation and breathing difficulties.\n\nThis flow ended abruptly on August 4, 2018. By this time, lava had destroyed more than 700 structures, covered 13.7 square miles (35.5 km2) of land, and added about 741 acres (300 hectares) of land to the island. Lava was a couple hundred meters thick in some places.\n\n2019 Fires Agriculture, Fires\n\nA wet 2018–2019 winter caused extra plant…\n\n20.8314\n\n-156.4238\n\nMaui, Hawaii, USA Off 3477\n\nA wet 2018–2019 winter caused extra plant growth on Maui, and thus extra fuel, and was followed by drought and record-breaking heat in summer 2019. That set up conditions for an intense fire season. Firefighters reported the unusual weather conditions that made the fires worse: above normal temperatures and below normal humidity.\n\nIn summer 2019, at least 19,300 acres burned across Maui, nearly all of it in the former cane fields. The dry grasses that largely replaced the cane fields are especially vulnerable to fire. Notice that the fire scar visible in the July 27, 2019, image didn’t last long, evidence that, unlike a forest fire burn scar, nonnative grass recovers rapidly and outcompetes native grasses after a fire.\n\nA Closer Look Agriculture, Water\n\nTaking a closer look at Garden City shows the…\n\n37.9653\n\n-100.8699\n\nGarden City, Kansas, USA Off 3292\n\nTaking a closer look at Garden City shows the expansion in area the city experienced since 1972. They also show the proximity of the city to those center-pivot irrigation circles. Four of these circles take up almost 1 square mile, or one section, of land.\n\nSouthwest of Garden City is an area absent of irrigated crops. This marks the location of the Sandsage Bison Range Wildlife Area, a reserve for many Plains natives, including an American bison herd.\n\nAnother gap in irrigated cropland is a bit to the west of the game refuge. Marked by light spots is Holcomb Station, a coal-fired power plant operated by the Sunflower Electric Power Corporation. The plant opened in 1983, so it does not appear in the 1972 Landsat image. The 362-megawatt station uses coal mined in Wyoming's Powder River Basin.\n\nA Dying Forest Coasts, Forests, Water\n\nThe coastal wetlands of Senegal are centered…\n\n14.0536\n\n-16.2885\n\nSaloum River, Senegal Off 3376\n\nThe coastal wetlands of Senegal are centered on the Saloum River and a myriad of estuaries and tidal flats that make up this complex ecosystem. The estuaries are generally bordered by dense, vigorous stands of mangroves (dark red tones in the Landsat images). Part of this ecosystem is protected in Saloum Delta National Park. The wetlands are critical habitats for wintering Palearctic birds, as well as many species of fish and mollusks.\n\nThe mangrove vegetation is made up of several species. Some mangrove species form low canopies, but others of the Rhizophora genus are among the tallest in the world, attaining heights of up to 40 meters. Mangroves grow in habitats that are periodically flooded by seawater (tidal influence) and river water. They are halophytes, plants that grow in salty environments.\n\nSince the late 1960s, it has become apparent that many of the mangrove forests are dying. One theory is that there is a serious mangrove disease that is systematically wiping them out. However, most evidence indicates that the mangrove die-off is related to the widespread Sahelian drought, which has plagued the region since 1968. The lack of rainfall has led to an accumulation of salts, exceeding the tolerance levels of the mangroves.\n\nThe die-off is particularly acute in the northern half of the Saloum River wetland complex (note the change in tone on the Landsat imagery, from dark red to dark gray). Today, there are vast areas of standing dead mangrove carcasses; many of these areas have been reduced to barren mud flats. The southern reaches of the wetland complex, however, still has healthy stands of mangrove forests.\n\nA Key Rest Stop for Birds Water, Wetlands, Wildlife\n\nThe Cheyenne Bottoms are on the North American…\n\n38.455\n\n-98.68\n\nCheyenne Bottoms, Kansas, USA Off 3503\n\nThe Cheyenne Bottoms are on the North American Central Flyway, kind of a bird highway for migration. The vast, diverse marsh provides food and water for a multitude of migrating bird species during both spring and fall migrations. Most of Kansas is too dry for such a stopover, and reservoirs are too deep. Birds need shallow water and long shorelines.\n\nSummer 2022 had below normal precipitation statewide and above normal temperatures. No water was available from Wet Walnut Creek to divert into the Bottoms. By November 2022, the U.S. Drought Monitor showed that a third of Kansas was in exceptional drought. Landsat images from October 2021 and October 2022 show that birds had nothing to stop for in fall 2022.\n\nA New Cutoff Natural-Disasters, Water\n\nFloods are examples of short-term…\n\n38.4375\n\n-87.7118\n\nIllinois/Indiana, USA Off 3136\n\nFloods are examples of short-term environmental change. They cause substantial damage and change for only a short time, such as a couple of weeks. The damage done to crops can last for an entire growing season, but in most cases, the landscape goes back to normal after the floodwaters recede. In some cases, however, a flood can cause more lasting change.\n\nThis flood changed the course of the Wabash River just above where it flows into the Ohio River. We have to go to a different Landsat image to see this happen, the one just south of the scene we’ve been examining. Images show a new cutoff that was formed from this flooding. About 2,200 acres of the land was rendered inaccessible by the new cutoff and shortened the river by about 7.5 miles.\n\nA Note on the Images Coasts, Water\n\nThe Landsat images that are shown on…\n\n-33.7550\n\n-80.8000\n\nSelkirk Island, Chile Off 3352\n\nThe Landsat images that are shown on Earthshots are combinations of three different wavelengths of the electromagnetic spectrum. Typically, the images show a combination of visible and infrared light; therefore, they are false color images. When these wavelengths, or bands, are shown individually instead of combined, different details sometimes emerge.\n\nIn the case of this Selkirk Karman vortex street scene, Landsat 7’s band 5 hints at a feature not visible in the image featured in the first section, which is a combination of bands 5, 4, and 3. Do you see it? Band 7 shows it even better. Northeast of the island, just east of the vortices, there is a bright spot and a bright plume trailing from it to the northeast. This may be a westbound ship, the effect of the ship’s exhaust shown in the clouds.\n\nA-74 Glaciers\n\nIt soon became too dark to see A-…\n\n-75.631\n\n-26.5\n\nBrunt Ice Shelf, Antarctica Off 3489\n\nIt soon became too dark to see A-74, which covered 1,270 km2, as the Antarctic winter set in. But Landsat 8 continued imaging with its Thermal Infrared Sensor (TIRS). The imagery is visibly dark, but TIRS detects temperature on the surface.\n\nTIRS shows relatively cooler temperatures darker than warmer temperatures, so the iceberg and ice shelf appear black. Clouds are relatively warmer than ice, so clouds sometimes cover the ice with swaths of gray.\n\nTIRS reveals what could not be seen in the darkness. The iceberg separates from the ice shelf, moves away, then bumps back into it before drifting south. In August 2021, in a timeframe of less than 2 weeks, the berg spun around the tip of Brunt Ice Shelf, brushed past it, rotated counterclockwise, and continued south. Landsat 8 spotted it with its visible bands in February 2022 much farther south along the Antarctic coast.\n\nIt’s unknown exactly how the ice shelf will respond to the 2021 North Rift calving. The situation is being monitored closely by Landsat along with Sentinel, WorldView, ground-penetrating radar, drone imagery, and a network of GPS stations.\n\nA-83 Glaciers\n\nAnother iceberg broke off the Brunt Ice…\n\n-75.631\n\n-26.5\n\nBrunt Ice Shelf, Antarctica Off 3534\n\nAnother iceberg broke off the Brunt Ice Shelf during the dark Antarctic winter in May 2024. Landsat’s Thermal Infrared Sensor (TIRS) instrument can spot icebergs in the dark, allowing scientists to see the new break even in the dark of winter. Landsat’s expanded acquisition program called LEAP—Landsat Extended Acquisitions of the Poles—provides even more observations of ice shelves in polar regions.\n\nThe iceberg, named A-83, is about the size of Portland, Oregon. It broke from an area that had previously formed a rift called Halloween Crack. The Landsat series displayed here shows imagery from TIRS. Darker areas are relatively colder than bright areas.\n\nThe iceberg is already moving, and Landsat’s TIRS instrument will be able to track it throughout the Antarctic winter because of the LEAP imaging plan. The new iceberg reinforces that while calving is normal, the recent rash of iceberg calvings at Brunt may mean that the ice shelf is destabilizing.\n\nAbandonment Agriculture\n\nNear the common borders of Ukraine,…\n\n51.2619\n\n30.2360\n\nChernobyl, Ukraine Off 3230\n\nNear the common borders of Ukraine, Belarus, and Russia, the Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant lies near the Pripyat River at the northwestern end of a cooling pond. The pond is 12 km long; during normal operation the plant discharged warm water counterclockwise around the pond, taking in cool water near the north end. Just northwest of the plant is the city of Pripyat. The smaller town of Chernobyl lies south of the cooling pond.\n\nThe 1986 and 1992 images clearly show farm abandonment. Agriculture appears as a collage of bright green (growing crops) and tan (highly reflective bare ground). Many of these areas appear a flat gray-green in 1992, indicating natural vegetation that has taken over the abandoned fields. The later images show that this land change persists.\n\nWhile the reactor was still on fire, all settlements within 30 km were evacuated, including Pripyat (1986 population 45,000), Chernobyl (1986 population 12,000), and 94 other villages (estimated total population 40,000). This area remains almost completely abandoned and is called the Chernobyl exclusion zone. The area is a mixture of former agriculture, forest, and marshland. It has been mostly free from human intervention since 1986.\n\nRadiation contamination later forced abandonment even outside the 30-km zone. High levels of cesium-137 detected years later caused further abandonment. In all, more than 120,000 people from 213 villages and cities were relocated outside contaminated areas.\n\nIn 2011, the director of the Chernobyl power plant, Ihor Gramotkin, was asked when the area would again be inhabitable. He responded, “At least 20,000 years” (Harrell and Marson).\n\nAbout the Marshes Water, Wetlands\n\nAll of the water that keeps the Mesopotamian…\n\n31.17\n\n47.35\n\nMesopotamian Marshes, Iraq Off 3497\n\nAll of the water that keeps the Mesopotamian Marshes alive comes from the Tigris and Euphrates rivers. Those rivers originate from precipitation in the Anatolian highlands of Turkey and the Zagros highlands of Iran, which occurs mostly in winter as snow. The snowmelt then provides—historically, at least—a flooding pulse downstream every spring. The land flattens out in southern Iraq, where the rivers slow and drop sediment, meander, and split into branches before flowing into the Persian Gulf.\n\nThe Mesopotamian marshlands absorb the excess water and expand in the spring, then shrink in the summer. That’s the normal seasonal pattern.\n\nIn the 1960s, the estimated spring extent of the marshes was 15,000–20,000 square kilometers. The vast marshland is vulnerable to drought and international conflict.\n\nAfter the Gulf War Water, Wetlands\n\nLarge-scale draining of the marshes began in…\n\n31.17\n\n47.35\n\nMesopotamian Marshes, Iraq Off 3499\n\nLarge-scale draining of the marshes began in earnest after the Gulf War of 1991. Water from the Tigris and Euphrates rivers was redirected to bypass the marshes. A west-east canal, 40 kilometers long and 1–2 kilometers wide, connected to the north-south Prosperity River, the prominent canal in the middle of these images. Even wider than the west-east canal, the Prosperity River is basically a massive moat that captures water from the rivers and tributaries and prevents it from flowing into the marshes.\n\nThroughout the 1990s, the marshes declined dramatically. The loss of vegetation and water is widespread and clear to see in the images. The extent of the marshland was reduced by about 85% by 2000.\n\nAgriculture Agriculture, Cities, Mining, Water, Wetlands\n\nThe fertile muck soils along the south shore…\n\n25.95\n\n-80.65\n\nThe Everglades and Miami, Florida, USA Off 3437\n\nThe fertile muck soils along the south shore of Lake Okeechobee in the Everglades Agricultural Area are intensively farmed. Tomatoes, beans, squash, peppers, and other crops are grown during the winter and shipped north. Sugarcane is the main crop there from spring through the fall.\n\nThe bottom center of the later images reveals the location of Stormwater Treatment Area (STA) 3/4, one of six STAs mandated by the State of Florida’s Everglades Forever Act, passed in 1994. STA 3/4 is distinct from the polygons of the agricultural area. Just to its west is Holey Land Wildlife Management Area.\n\nThese constructed wetlands are designed to remove phosphorus that comes from agricultural runoff. Under previous agricultural practices, phosphorus from fertilizers was allowed to run off into the Everglades. Phosphorus is an essential nutrient, but too much of it alters the Everglades’ natural habitats.\n\nThese treatment areas channel runoff through shallow marshes filled with plants that absorb phosphorus, reducing the amount that flows into the Everglades. The plants include cattail, southern naiad, hydrilla, and algae. These plants continue to absorb phosphorus even after they die and decompose. The underlying limestone layer then holds the phosphorus, providing long-term storage.\n\nBesides helping to restore the Everglades, these treatment areas have become a great home for wading birds, ducks, and alligators. Florida offers hunting and other recreational opportunities at many of these treatment areas.\n\nAgriculture Agriculture, Cities, Mountains\n\nIrrigated agriculture in the valley,…\n\n36.0883\n\n52.1517\n\nElburz Mountains, Iran Off 3282\n\nIrrigated agriculture in the valley, shown by the red field patterns, has increased. This agriculture depends on rainfall captured in the mountains and channeled to the valley floor, as well as nearby rivers and drilled wells.\n\nAgriculture Agriculture, Cities, Deserts, Water\n\nThe area of vegetation just outside the delta…\n\n30.0999\n\n31.0688\n\nNile River Delta, Egypt Off 3429\n\nThe area of vegetation just outside the delta northwest of Cairo is new agricultural development, with some of the crops irrigated through center-pivot irrigation. The most common crops grown are cotton, rice, corn, potatoes, oranges, and wheat. Although areas at a distance from the Nile often are not able to be irrigated, land that does support crops produces high yields and is harvested two or three times in many years.\n\nFood shortages have been documented for thousands of years in Egypt, and they can still cause problems. As the Egyptian population grows, producing enough food has become more difficult, so the government subsidizes food to make comfortable life possible. One staple food highly subsidized in Egypt is bread. The \"bread riots\" in 1977 and 2008 were the result of a reduction in those subsidies.\n\nDespite government regulation that keeps the production of non-food crops like cotton low, Egypt still imports much of its food, especially wheat. This can increase the price of food even higher.\n\nDams being built on the Nile River and its tributaries upstream from Egypt could affect the amount of water making its way to Egypt.\n\nAl Kharj Cities, Deserts\n\nSoutheast of Riyadh, irrigation has clearly…\n\n24.7117\n\n46.7242\n\nRiyadh, Saudi Arabia Off 3455\n\nSoutheast of Riyadh, irrigation has clearly increased over time, particularly around the city of Al Kharj. The red circles are fields with center-pivot irrigation systems, drawing water from Saudi Arabia’s aquifers. This irrigation development resulted from the investment of part of Saudi Arabia’s oil revenues in an effort to modernize agriculture.\n\nAlaska Glaciers, Mountains\n\nOne of the factors that improves on Landsat…\n\n60.956\n\n-141.34\n\nLandsat’s Return Beam Vidicon Off 3409\n\nOne of the factors that improves on Landsat sensors over the project’s history is the quality of the data. For example, compare these images of glaciers in Alaska’s Chitina River Valley from 1980. There is more background noise in an RBV image than there is in the MSS image. The RBV on Landsat 3 had a slightly higher spatial resolution, but the low signal-to-noise ratio makes it harder to pull out surface detail.\n\nThe 2018 image from Landsat 8’s Operational Land Imager has even better signal-to-noise ratio and higher resolution than both early sensors. The image reveals more detail about the roughness and flow of the ice. Landsat 8’s shortwave infrared bands provide a better distinction between ice and rock or soil.\n\nHigh-quality data is needed in studying glaciers. Glaciers reflect visible light and appear bright white in natural color satellite images. But a glacier absorbs near-infrared light. The near-infrared and shortwave infrared imaging on later Landsats show the difference between snow and bare ground more clearly.\n\nHowever, glaciologists still found RBV useful for mapping arctic regions. In high latitudes, images acquired at low sun angles helped enhance local topographic relief. The high resolution of the RBV on Landsat 3 supplemented MSS imagery.\n\nIn the RBV image of the Chitina River Valley, the brightest wavy streaks are glaciers. Note that they extend farther downstream in 1980 than they do in 2018. In the Landsat 8 image, wavy blue streaks indicate glaciers. They are generally in the same location as in the 1980 image, just diminished.\n\nWhile RBV might not be exactly what is needed or have the ideal attributes for a study or for mapping forests, glaciers, and other land covers, perhaps it’s one more tool to add to the collection in studying land change. It’s at least worth another look. Besides, as Faundeen said, “RBV is another interesting chapter in the Landsat story.”\n\nAn Unusual Mountain Glaciers, Mountains\n\nMany of the world’s highest peaks are the…\n\n-3.0665\n\n37.3507\n\nMount Kilimanjaro, Tanzania Off 3465\n\nMany of the world’s highest peaks are the barely tallest points of high ranges, but Kilimanjaro stands alone, 15,000 feet above the surrounding plains. It actually has three peaks from three old volcanoes: Kibo (2), Mawenzi, and Shira.\n\nIn these Landsat images, concentric rings show the vegetation zones around this unusual peak. The bare summit is surrounded by low grass and shrubs. These transition to a band of forest, protected as a reserve, which appears bright green. Below this is a densely populated agricultural area, appearing as speckled light green in the Landsat images. And at its base, the mountain turns dry again, supporting fewer plants and people.\n\nPeople have farmed the lower slopes for at least 2,000 years. In the last century, the mountain’s population has grown rapidly—about tenfold between 1910 and 2000. These people raised cattle, fruits and vegetables, and coffee. Prevented from migrating upslope by the forest/wildlife preserve, people have moved out into drier areas.\n\nAnimation Deforestation, Forests\n\nPlay this …\n\n-10.0384\n\n-63.3715\n\nRondônia, Brazil Off 3163\n\nPlay this animation to see the change in this area happen from 1975 to 2017. The animation uses a Landsat image from most of the years in this time period to demonstrate the rapid rate of deforestation. Huge areas of Rondônia's dense rain forest transform to cleared areas in only a few decades. Unseen in these images are the effects of the deforestation on wildlife habitats and local and global climate.\n\nAnimations Energy, Mining\n\nThe coal mines in the PRB advance quickly…\n\n43.59\n\n-105.29\n\nPowder River Basin, Wyoming, USA Off 3240\n\nThe coal mines in the PRB advance quickly enough to see a lot of change from year to year. Two animations available here show the annual change of the mines in the regions.\n\nThe first animation shows almost one image per year back to 1984 of both the Black Thunder and North Antelope Rochelle Complex Mines. The second one listed is a close-up of the North Antelope Rochelle Complex and covers the same time period.\n\nThe date of each image appears in the lower right corner.\n\nPRB coal mines: 1984–2018\n\nNorth Antelope Rochelle Complex Mines: 1984–2018\n\nAnnual Change Water, Wetlands\n\nIn the flooded season, this part of Mali’s…\n\n14.6515\n\n-4.4040\n\nInland Delta of the Niger River, Mali Off 3178\n\nIn the flooded season, this part of Mali’s landscape stands out as bright green against the arid brown African Sahel. The Niger River and the Inland Delta have been an important water supply in the southern Sahara for thousands of years.\n\nThe river channels, lakes, swamps, and floodplains provide the main livelihoods in the delta: livestock, fishing, and farming. The delta is also a refuge for many migrating birds. After rice farming and livestock, fishing is the most important industry of the delta. The catch varies from year to year depending on water levels. An overall decrease in available water in the delta directly affects the population in this industry.\n\nThis series of images shows that the extent of the seasonal flood can vary. For example, 1984 was a low flood year, and the green extent in the image is smaller than it is for 1999. Another low water year was 2011. Exceptionally high floods can damage habitats and irrigation, but extremely low flows like those in 1984 can be disastrous. The loss of livestock caused by the lack of water one year can have long-lasting effects.\n\nTwo main threats to the region are inadequate water management and climate change. With growing water use and a predicted decrease in rain in the Sahel, the river flow of the Niger is expected to decline. The livelihoods of the delta’s people could be at risk.\n\nDiverting upstream water for irrigation means less water for the delta. For example, the Fomi Dam in Guinea is being planned. The two countries are working on assessing the possible risks and benefits of the dam.\n\n(Black stripes run through the 2011 image because of the Scan Line Corrector failure on Landsat 7 in May 2003.)\n\nAntelope Valley, California, USA Cities, Energy\n\nAntelope Valley in southern California is the…\n\n34.8313\n\n-118.2433\n\nAntelope Valley, California, USA On 3189\n\nAntelope Valley in southern California is the western part of the Mojave Desert. The San Gabriel Mountains and the Tehachapi Mountains give the valley a triangular shape. The southern edge of the valley is the San Andreas Fault.\n\nWhile farming is going on in the valley in the more traditional sense, with irrigated fields showing up as bright green circles or rectangles in these Landsat images, farming of a different kind is also going on. With average annual wind speeds of 14 to 20 miles per hour and plenty of clear, sunny days, this part of the desert is on the cutting edge of wind and solar power.\n\n(The small burn scar seen in the 2023 image is the Danny Fire, which burned almost 1,600 acres.)\n\nAquaculture Aquaculture, Coasts, Deforestation, Forests\n\nMangroves in the Ayeyarwady Delta are also…\n\n15.86\n\n95\n\nAyeyarwady Delta, Myanmar Off 3480\n\nMangroves in the Ayeyarwady Delta are also being replaced by aquaculture. In the southwestern part of the delta, brackish shrimp pond development is expanding. The dark blue shapes in the images represent the shrimp ponds. Not as much land is being taken up by aquaculture, but this industry is growing.\n\nWhile some mangroves have been restored on the delta, the aquaculture, agriculture, and cutting activities need to be monitored so that the benefits of mangroves can be maintained. Researchers continue to use Landsat and other remote sensing information to monitor this region.\n\nAral Sea, Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan Agriculture, Dams, Water\n\nWe see a lot of change with 50 years of…\n\n45.016\n\n58.99\n\nAral Sea, Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan On 3193\n\nWe see a lot of change with 50 years of Landsat imagery, along with the declassified satellite imagery in the archives at EROS. The drying of the Aral Sea is likely the most dramatic change occurring over the past several decades in this imagery.\n\nThe Aral Sea once covered about 68,000 square kilometers, a little bigger than the U.S. state of West Virginia. It was the 4th largest lake in the world. It is now only about 10% of the size it was in 1960. Coastlines receded several kilometers from what were once coastal communities.\n\nThe Aral Sea is a terminal lake. Large permanent snow fields and glaciers in mountain ranges feed the two major rivers that flow into it, but it has no outlet. Syr Darya flows into the northern part of the Aral Sea. Amu Darya flows into the southern part. (Darya means river in the Turkic languages of central Asia.)\n\nThe precipitation rate over the Aral Sea is very low, less than 200 millimeters per year. However, 1,000–1,200 millimeters of water evaporates from the sea each year. Therefore, stability of the water level greatly depends on inflow from these two rivers, which has diminished over the past few decades leading to the shrinking of the lake.\n\nThe sea has in fact split into two separate bodies of water, referred to as the North Aral Sea and the South Aral Sea. The North Aral has stabilized but the South Aral has continued to shrink and become saltier. Up until the 1960s, Aral Sea salinity was around 10 grams per liter, less than one-third the salinity of the ocean. The salinity level now exceeds 100 grams per liter in the South Aral, which is about three times saltier than the ocean.\n\nThe effects of this dramatic change are far-reaching, geographically, environmentally, and economically. The subsequent sections describe how a body of water this size could nearly disappear so quickly.\n\nAralsk Agriculture, Dams, Water\n\nThe city of Aralsk is shown in the 1964 ARGON…\n\n45.016\n\n58.99\n\nAral Sea, Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan Off 3196\n\nThe city of Aralsk is shown in the 1964 ARGON image on the coast of the sea. By 1977, the sea had retreated from the city but was still just a few kilometers away. As depicted in the 2015 image, Aralsk sits nearly 20 km from the water’s edge.\n\nCommercial fishing in the Aral Sea peaked in the late 1950s. With the drop in water levels and rise in salinity, the fish that once thrived in the sea could not survive. As a result, commercial fishing was no longer sustainable by the early 1980s.\n\nWith the recovery of the North Aral, commercial fishing has started up again. It’s still just a fraction of what it was in the 1950s, but Aralsk is again processing fish at a new plant, established after the completion of the Kok-Aral Dam in 2005. Aralsk is not the thriving city it once was, but the return of the North Aral gives residents some hope of recovery.\n\nAriquemes Deforestation, Forests\n\nThe early images show main roads cutting…\n\n-10.0384\n\n-63.3715\n\nRondônia, Brazil Off 3161\n\nThe early images show main roads cutting through the forest. Highway 421 snakes through the forest south-southwest from the city of Ariquemes, and Highway 364 runs roughly north to south through Ariquemes. More roads branch out from the main ones to create the fishbone pattern. As time goes on, a patchwork of cleared areas, forest remnants, and settlements is left behind.\n\nArtificial Holes Cities, Mining\n\nThe bodies of water further south, east of…\n\n28.527\n\n-81.4118\n\nOrlando, Florida, USA Off 3411\n\nThe bodies of water further south, east of Tampa, look completely different, because they have a much more human origin: phosphate mining.\n\nSouth of Orlando lies the world's most productive source of phosphate, a critical nutrient for modern agriculture. In these images, plants look red and phosphate mines appear as a bright, high-contrast mix of white bare earth and blue-black ponds. The images show the phosphate region expanding, as more lands were put through the cycle of mining and reclamation.\n\nUnder just the right conditions, some ocean sediments (like those forming limestone) become rich in phosphorus. Ideally, an upwelling of cold, phosphorus-rich water to the shallow waters near shore stimulates all forms of sea life, from algae to animals. Their shells and bones, plus crystals of phosphorus, concentrate phosphorus on the ocean floor. Moving water—tides and currents underwater, streams and floods above sea level—sorts the heavy phosphate pebbles from the lighter sands, further concentrating the valuable nutrient.\n\nAtchafalaya Delta, Louisiana, USA Coasts, Water, Wetlands\n\nThe Mississippi River Delta region…\n\n29.516\n\n-91.357\n\nAtchafalaya Delta, Louisiana, USA On 3510\n\nThe Mississippi River Delta region in southern Louisiana is losing land to sea level rise, subsidence, and hurricane damage. The mouth of the Atchafalaya River, a distributary of the Mississippi River, is an exception. It has been building two deltas for the past several decades. The Atchafalaya Delta exemplifies the importance of freshwater and sediment to maintaining and even building land in the delta region.\n\nThe Atchafalaya River branches away from the Mississippi River where the Red River joins it. The Atchafalaya takes about 30% of the combined flow of both rivers and carries the water and sediment south.\n\nJust east of the Atchafalaya basin, land is rapidly disappearing from the Louisiana coast. Besides subsidence, sea level rise, and hurricanes, a lack of sediment input from the Mississippi River is also causing land loss, making the region more vulnerable to storms.\n\nBesides the risk to wildlife habitats, coastal Louisiana supports more than 30% of the commercial fisheries in the United States, and five of the country’s top 20 ports are located there. Furthermore, in 2017, the USGS reported that a fifth of the country’s oil and gas is transported through the southern Louisiana wetlands.\n\nThe time series of Landsat imagery shows that the deltas do not progressively extend into the Gulf. They are affected by local conditions like tides and the timing of hurricanes and floods. So while the overall trend is extension and delta building, the deltas seem to temporarily contract at times. In the Landsat images, water is dark blue, and vegetation is green.\n\nAthabasca Oil Sands, Alberta, Canada Fires, Forests, Mining, Natural-Disasters\n\nOne of the world’s largest reserves of oil…\n\n56.978\n\n-111.46\n\nAthabasca Oil Sands, Alberta, Canada On 3200\n\nOne of the world’s largest reserves of oil sits under the boreal forest of northwestern Alberta, Canada. The deposit covers about 142,200 square kilometers (54,900 square miles), an area a little larger than the U.S. state of Wisconsin.\n\nKnown as the oil sands region, it accounts for the largest segment of Alberta’s economy. According to Alberta Energy, proven reserves in the oil sands in 2016 were 165.4 billion barrels.\n\nThis series of imagery focuses on the largest of the three oil sands areas in Alberta, the Athabasca region. Located just north of Fort McMurray along the Athabasca River, the mining of the Athabasca region has grown dramatically over the last three decades.\n\nAyeyarwady Delta, Myanmar Coasts, Deforestation, Forests\n\nThe Ayeyarwady Delta—also called the Irrawaddy…\n\n15.86\n\n95\n\nAyeyarwady Delta, Myanmar On 3125\n\nThe Ayeyarwady Delta—also called the Irrawaddy Delta—is a vast alluvial floodplain. The delta spans over 35,000 km2 (13,500 mi2) and was once home to an extensive tract of mangrove forests, but deforestation has changed the landscape. One scientific study estimated that the delta lost 1,685 km2 (651 mi2) from 1978 to 2011. This 50-year sequence of Landsat images shows the relatively rapid loss of mangrove forest.\n\nBahrain Cities, Coasts, Deserts\n\nThe most noticeable land change in these…\n\n26.0195\n\n50.5535\n\nBahrain On 3206\n\nThe most noticeable land change in these Landsat images is simply the addition of land itself. In Bahrain, a nation of 36 islands in the Middle East, the sea is shallow enough along the northern and eastern coast to make the addition of land relatively inexpensive.\n\nThe main Bahrain Island is about 990 square kilometers; however, it took less than two decades for the coastal zone of Bahrain to increase by about 40 square kilometers. All of this added land is dredged from the seabed in massive land reclamation projects.\n\nBesides the large land additions, an obvious increase in urban areas dominates the images. Bahrain’s 1970 population was 213,000; in 2014 it was estimated to be 1,316,000. The country’s urban extent doubled between 1987 and 2013.\n\nBakken Oil Boom, North Dakota, USA Cities, Mining\n\nEven though oil is underground, Landsat images…\n\n48.1696\n\n-103.3259\n\nBakken Oil Boom, North Dakota, USA On 3209\n\nEven though oil is underground, Landsat images can reveal related land changes on the surface. The Bakken oil boom has made North Dakota the second leading oil producing state—behind only Texas. Evidence of this boom is apparent on the landscape.\n\nThe focus of this oil boom, which began around 2008, is on the Bakken formation of western North Dakota, northeastern Montana, and part of Canada. The Bakken formation constitutes one of the largest deposits of oil and natural gas in the United States. The Bakken is part of the larger Williston Basin, which, according to a 2013 USGS study, has 7.4 billion barrels of oil that is recoverable using today’s technology.\n\nThese Landsat images show the increasing number of oil platforms over just a few years, along with associated infrastructure changes. The overview images in this introductory section show the entire region that will be discussed in more detail in the following subsections.\n\nThe North Dakota oil industry took off in the 1950s. When oil prices dropped in the 1980s, that boom ended. Oil prices recovered by 1990, but the current boom didn’t hit until the technology of hydraulic fracturing, or fracking, came along in the 2000s. By 2008, drilling in North Dakota surged like never before and oil production increased dramatically.\n\nThe oil and natural gas within the Bakken are locked in a rock formation. Fracking uses a mix of water, salt, chemicals, and sand to fracture the rock. The fractured rock allows the oil to flow to the well.\n\nThe price of oil crashed again in 2014, halting most of the drilling. But this was only after North Dakota’s oil industry reached the milestone of producing 1 million barrels per day. In mid-2017, oil prices recovered to around $50 a barrel, stabilizing the situation in North Dakota.\n\nBatagaika Crater, Russia Forests\n\nSometimes described as resembling a stingray…\n\n67.58\n\n134.78\n\nBatagaika Crater, Russia On 3473\n\nSometimes described as resembling a stingray or a tadpole, the Batagaika Crater is a widening chasm in Siberia and the world’s largest permafrost crater.\n\nMultiple satellites have recorded the crater’s growth, from declassified satellite imagery collected in the 1960s to current multispectral sensor images from Landsat and Europe’s Copernicus Sentinel-2 satellite, to build a continuous view over the last 60 years.\n\nEach exposed layer of the crater wall is like a snapshot in time, helping scientists understand the past climate. Layers of permafrost exposed at the bottom might be up to 650,000 years old. Scientists have also discovered mummified wildlife in the crater. In 2018, the remains of a 42,000-year-old foal of an extinct horse species were found.\n\nWhy this matters\n\nAs frozen permafrost soils thaw, they release carbon dioxide, methane, and nitrous oxide—greenhouse gases that fuel global warming.\n\nBathtub Ring Dams, Water\n\nComparing the 1984 (high water level) and 2005…\n\n36.9378\n\n-111.4841\n\nLake Powell, Utah and Arizona, USA Off 3384\n\nComparing the 1984 (high water level) and 2005 (low water level) images, there is a pale outline along many parts of the lake. When the water level drops, canyon walls that were once inundated are exposed again.\n\nReferred to as the “bathtub ring,” this pale outline shows when the lake is below capacity. Calcium carbonate and other mineral compounds, many of them various salts in the water, attach themselves to the sandstone and leave behind this white mark. The top of the white mark is the high water mark. The only time the bathtub ring is not visible is when the lake is completely full.\n\nBear Glacier Lagoon Glaciers, Water\n\nBefore 1950, the entire basin was covered by…\n\n59.9569\n\n-149.5823\n\nBear Glacier, Alaska, USA Off 3222\n\nBefore 1950, the entire basin was covered by Bear Glacier and ended at a terminal moraine. By 1961, a small lake had formed, referred to as Bear Glacier Lagoon. By 1984, the size of the lagoon had doubled. It has continued to grow quickly as the glacier has retreated over time. People can now go kayaking among the icebergs on Bear Glacier Lagoon.\n\nIn August 2014, water from Bear Glacier Lagoon breached the moraine that separates the lagoon from Resurrection Bay. Lake levels dropped by 1–2 feet (0.3–0.6 meters). These glacier lake outburst floods occur regularly. The breach is visible in the extreme close-up in the 2014 Landsat image, in which different infrared wavelengths were used to make the breach more visible.\n\nBear Glacier, Alaska, USA Glaciers, Water\n\nSatellite images of Earth help us observe…\n\n59.9569\n\n-149.5823\n\nBear Glacier, Alaska, USA On 3219\n\nSatellite images of Earth help us observe locations that can be difficult to reach in person. Glaciers are sensitive to changes in regional and global climate, so scientists want to monitor them regularly. While some scientists study glaciers in the field, the Landsat satellites allow many others to monitor glacial change from the comfort of their office.\n\nBear Glacier is an outlet glacier of the Harding Icefield in Kenai Fjords National Park, Alaska. Glaciers form when fallen snow compresses into an ice mass over many years; the process usually takes centuries. The ice then flows to lower elevations. Besides showing visible retreat over the past few decades, Bear Glacier has also thinned about 2.5 feet (0.75 meters) per year from the early 1950s to the 1990s.\n\nSince Bear Glacier and many other remote glaciers are largely inaccessible, satellite images provide important insights into how they change over time.\n\n(Black stripes run through some of the images because of the Scan Line Corrector failure on Landsat 7 in May 2003.)\n\nBeijing, China Cities\n\nThese images show the growth of Beijing from…\n\n39.9161\n\n116.3909\n\nBeijing, China On 3109\n\nThese images show the growth of Beijing from 1977 to 2022. In the images, the blue tones representing buildings and pavement spread outward, replacing the red tones of natural and agricultural vegetation. The city has now grown far beyond its traditional core around the Inner City, which is visible as a bright rectangle in the zoom-in images.\n\nBeijing's Growth Cities\n\nBeijing has grown and changed remarkably in…\n\n39.9161\n\n116.3909\n\nBeijing, China Off 3112\n\nBeijing has grown and changed remarkably in the \"reform era\" since 1979, in its own distinct pattern. U.S. cities, for example, are often shaped like a circus tent, with a sharp peak of skyscrapers in the center, sloping off to mid-rise buildings and then low suburbs of single-family houses. Beijing, in contrast, is bowl-shaped, with low historic buildings in its center, surrounded by many commercial skyscrapers and residential towers. Height restrictions have limited many buildings to 3 stories within 250 m of the Forbidden City, 10 stories within the Second Ring Road, and unlimited stories beyond. And single-family buildings are rare in Beijing, except in recent western-style suburbs built for foreigners.\n\nSeveral distinct dynamics have shaped Beijing's growth. The state built a great deal of housing in Beijing during the 1950s, but little was built in the 1960s and 1970s, partly to discourage migration to the city. In the 1970s, many people who spent the Cultural Revolution in the countryside returned to Beijing, and others came seeking jobs. Married couples increasingly sought their own home after marriage rather than living with their parents. By the late 1970s, housing was scarce and crowded. In 1979, along with new reforms, came a boom in housing construction that was much-needed. Beijing's 2021 population is estimated at just over 19.4 million, with a population density of just over 4,600 people per square km.\n\nIn the more socialist era of 1949–1979, most Beijingers lived and worked in the same place. These \"work units\" included communal dining halls and infirmaries. So the city was not highly differentiated into office, shopping, industrial, and residential areas. There were few reasons to travel across town often. This has also changed in the reform era; housing is typically still tied to a job, especially for the many state employees, but this housing is not at the workplace. Many work-units buy floors of apartment buildings, or other blocks of housing, so many coworkers live together.\n\nIn the 1980s, many industrial plants were moved from the central city to outlying areas. Much of the new housing was also outside the Third Ring Road, in medium- and high-rise buildings often built on former agricultural land. In the central city, office districts and shopping districts have been built or expanded. Many new buildings serve the increasing number of foreigners doing business in Beijing.\n\nPartly because people's daily activities now occur in separate parts of the city, traffic has increased greatly, and congestion is a major problem. An extensive subway line now operates in Beijing. By 2010, the Beijing subway network had 14 lines, 198 stations, and 336 km of track.\n\nThe Chinese government has provided a bicycle renting system in Beijing to try to relieve traffic congestion. But car use has risen dramatically in the last decade, and city planners are planning around the automobile and building expressways.\n\nBelzoni Aquaculture\n\nDuring the aquaculture expansion of the 1980s…\n\n33.311206\n\n-90.62133\n\nCatfish Farms, Mississippi, USA Off 3492\n\nDuring the aquaculture expansion of the 1980s, cropland in the fertile valley was converted to catfish ponds. After the decline, many ponds returned to cropland. Some were left unused.\n\nThe Landsat images from 1972 and 1986 show that impressive expansion. Based on the 1972 image, which is coarser resolution than the later Landsat imagery, the land was either cropland or flat wetland before the catfish ponds were constructed.\n\nNear Belzoni, Mississippi, many ponds have partially converted to cropland. According to the USDA Cropland Data Layer, the region shown in these images has converted to cotton, corn, soybeans, and rice growing. There are also woody wetlands in the former ponds.\n\nThe 2021 images span the seasons to show which areas have converted back to cropland. Actively growing crops appear bright green in the summer images. Those fields turn a washed-out pink after harvest. The areas that remain dark green in the fall are forested. By winter, those areas, too, become a faded brown and are the first areas to green up again in spring.\n\nWhere the water disappears throughout the 2021 images may be rice fields. Places where the water persists all year are catfish ponds.\n\nBeyond the Ice Glaciers, Mountains\n\nTourism is now a major part of the local…\n\n-3.0665\n\n37.3507\n\nMount Kilimanjaro, Tanzania Off 3468\n\nTourism is now a major part of the local economy. Ten thousand visitors climb the mountain every year, employing local people as porters and guides. The snow and ice are part of what attracts the tourists, some of whom come as a “last chance” opportunity, believing that the glaciers will soon disappear. Scientific estimates of that date vary, and some believe the glaciers on the side slopes may survive. If the glaciers do disappear, seasonal snow will still whiten the peak, but perhaps not in the dry seasons when most tourists come. In the end, on this mountain both science and economics are always drawn back, as if by some powerful cultural gravity, to the famous white landscape on its peak.\n\nBig Dam, Big Changes Dams, Energy, Water\n\nBesides hydropower, the dam has made river…\n\n30.8179\n\n110.9978\n\nThree Gorges Dam, China Off 3171\n\nBesides hydropower, the dam has made river navigation easier. The river is now deeper and slower, allowing larger ships to travel on the river from Shanghai, at the river’s estuary, all the way to Chongqing, over 373 miles (600 kilometers) upstream from the dam. The Landsat images show straight lines next to the dam—the lock system that raises and lowers ships past the dam.\n\nHistorically, the Yangtze River has flooded catastrophically. The floods have caused thousands of deaths and damaged agricultural land. Flood control is one of the major anticipated benefits of the dam. The overall long-term extent of this benefit can be determined in the future as a wider range of high water levels are experienced on the river. In addition to flood regulation, water from the reservoir has been used to irrigate dry farmland during drought.\n\nHowever, the project came with some downsides, including the relocation of over 1 million people. Other dangers added to the project’s criticisms. For example, much less sediment now reaches the lower portions of the river, which affects the intertidal wetland habitat at the river’s delta.\n\nThe reservoir’s water level is allowed to go down in summer to accommodate floodwaters. The water level rises again at the end of summer. These periodic water pressure changes destabilize the surrounding slopes, increasing the likelihood of landslides. Furthermore, the added weight of the reservoir’s water may be intensifying local fault activity; since the reservoir filled in 2003, seismic activity has increased.\n\nThe reservoir could also affect precipitation in the region. The lake effect in this mountainous region can be enhanced; moist air is forced upward as it reaches the shoreline, adding to low stratus clouds and fog. Additionally, the enhanced evaporation because of the lake can create a microclimate with different precipitation patterns.\n\nBitumen Forests, Mining, Natural-Disasters\n\nThe oil type mined in the Athabasca oil sands…\n\n56.978\n\n-111.46\n\nAthabasca Oil Sands, Alberta, Canada Off 3201\n\nThe oil type mined in the Athabasca oil sands region is bitumen. This naturally occurring oil is so viscous that even at room temperature it acts like cold molasses.\n\nThe oil sand is quartz sand; each grain of sand is surrounded by a thin film of water, and then covered in the heavy oil. The bitumen is too thick to flow or to be pumped without first being heated.\n\nOf the three oil sands areas in Alberta, only the Athabasca region has reserves shallow enough for surface mining. The Athabasca River, over tens of millions of years, eroded away the sediment that covered the bitumen, making it reachable. Surface mining causes a larger and more visible disturbance of the land surface than other types of mining. The surface mineable area there covers about 4,800 square kilometers (1,850 square miles).\n\nBlack Hills, SD, USA Forests, Mountains, Wildlife\n\nWe can’t see bugs from space, but we can see…\n\n43.8433\n\n-103.4946\n\nBlack Hills, SD, USA On 3224\n\nWe can’t see bugs from space, but we can see the effects of insect infestation in Landsat imagery. An unprecedented mountain pine beetle epidemic started in the Black Hills of South Dakota in 1996 and has damaged about 430,000 acres of forest land. The pine beetle, about the size of a grain of rice, is killing ponderosa and other pines throughout the Black Hills.\n\nNormally, the mountain pine beetle contributes to the health of a forest by infesting and killing older and stressed trees, which helps make the forest more productive. However, the recent large outbreak is doing more harm than good. It can affect water quality. It can convert the forest from a carbon sink to a carbon source. And where insect outbreaks and forest disturbance caused by wildfire overlap, the effects can actually be both harmful and beneficial. All of the effects of an outbreak need to be monitored.\n\nMountain pine beetles usually live in small numbers. It’s normal for the population to boom occasionally, but the current epidemic is unprecedented. Beyond the Black Hills, pine beetle outbreaks have occurred extensively in many pine forests throughout western North America, from British Columba in Canada to New Mexico.\n\nIn these Landsat images, beetle infestation is typically indicated by a washed-out pinkish color as seen in the top center and lower right of the images. The more pronounced pink region in the lower left of these images is a burn scar from the Jasper Fire, which occurred in 2000.\n\nBlack Rock Playa, Nevada, USA Deserts, Water\n\nIn a desolate corner of Nevada, a playa…\n\n40.7861\n\n-119.207\n\nBlack Rock Playa, Nevada, USA On 3052\n\nIn a desolate corner of Nevada, a playa surrounded by rugged mountains and described as dry, dusty, desolate, and devoid of vegetation comes to life the week before Labor Day every year for a unique arts festival.\n\nBlack Rock Playa in northwestern Nevada is part of the lakebed of ancient Lake Lahontan, a deep lake that existed as recently as 15,000 years ago. Lake Lahontan left fine sediments on the lake bottom to form the extremely flat surface. According to a detailed topographic study, the elevation of the playa varies by just 1 meter over 310 square kilometers.\n\nThe playa stretches 56 kilometers from the small town of Gerlach toward the northeast and the edge of the Black Rock Range.\n\nRainfall is rare during summer when daily high temperatures regularly exceed 37°C, making the surface hard-packed and dusty. Snowmelt flows into the playa in the spring to smooth out the surface. The clay minerals on the lakebed expand when wet and then contract as they dry to form a cracked pattern.\n\nBlack Rock Playa is managed by the Bureau of Land Management (BLM) as The Black Rock Desert–High Rock Canyon Emigrant Trails National Conservation Area.\n\nBlack Thunder Mine Energy, Mining\n\nThe Black Thunder Mine, shown in the series of…\n\n43.59\n\n-105.29\n\nPowder River Basin, Wyoming, USA Off 3236\n\nThe Black Thunder Mine, shown in the series of Landsat images on the left, has sent 2.2 billion tons of coal to U.S. power plants since 1977. It produces 4 tons of coal per second.\n\nThe images show the expansion of the open-pit mining operations at Black Thunder. The black lines are the coal seams, the layers of coal that formed over time and lie under the land surface. Lighter straight lines are stepped benches that allow trucks to drive in and out of the mine.\n\nBotany Bay Cities, Coasts\n\nThe other major natural harbour on the south…\n\n-33.852\n\n151.2105\n\nSydney, Australia Off 3174\n\nThe other major natural harbour on the south end of these images is Botany Bay. The runways of Sydney Airport stretch into the bay. The main north-south runway is 3,962 meters long and was built in 1963. The other runway that extends into the bay appears in the 2002 image; it was completed in 1994.\n\nAnother expansion seen in Botany Bay is Port Botany, a major shipping port for Australia. The port is in an ideal location because of the deep water channels of the bay and proximity to the open waters of the Tasman Sea. The most recent addition is seen in the 2013 image, which shows the development of 63 hectares of land.\n\nBreiðamerkurjökull Glacier, Iceland Glaciers, Water\n\nThe Breiðamerkurjökull glacier tongue, one of…\n\n64.1080\n\n-16.2630\n\nBreiðamerkurjökull Glacier, Iceland On 3227\n\nThe Breiðamerkurjökull glacier tongue, one of the largest in Iceland, flows from Vatnajökull, Iceland’s largest glacier. According to descriptions in historical accounts, this glacier tongue advanced toward the Atlantic Ocean up until the turn of the 19th century. Since about 1930, it has been in full retreat.\n\nIn these false color Landsat images, vegetated land surfaces appear red. Snow and ice are white. The Vatnajökull glacier is the bright white area in the upper left. Outlet glaciers streak away from it toward the Atlantic Ocean in the lower right. Breiðamerkurjökull is the largest glacial tongue on Vatnajökull and is featured in the center of these images.\n\n(Black stripes run through the 2006 image because of the Scan Line Corrector failure on Landsat 7 in May 2003.)\n\nBridge Agriculture, Cities, Coasts\n\nCities that are growing this rapidly must also…\n\n22.621\n\n113.729\n\nPearl River Delta, China Off 3154\n\nCities that are growing this rapidly must also show accompanying infrastructure changes. The additions of bridges, highways, railroads, and airports are intended to merge the cities of the delta into a single megalopolis.\n\nOne ambitious project is the Hong Kong-Zhuhai-Macau Bridge, which opened in 2018, to connect the three cities and cut the travel time from Hong Kong to Zhuhai from 3 hours to 30 minutes. Visible as a long, thin line across the bay, the bridge-tunnel system includes 42 kilometers of bridges over water and a 7-kilometer tunnel. The tunnel allows ships to enter and exit the bay and runs between two artificial islands. The entire system is about 15 times longer than the Golden Gate Bridge. The total cost of bridge was $7.56 billion.\n\nBuilt to withstand an 8.0 earthquake, the bridge makes it easier for goods from the entire PRD to be transported to Hong Kong’s international airport for export. Speaking of the airport, a third runway was added north of the existing runways, 3,800 m long and built on 650 hectares of reclaimed land.\n\nThe natural color image from Europe's Copernicus Sentinel-2 satellite shows the bridge at 10-meter resolution. Ships are visible in the water, including the wakes behind the ships.\n\nBringing the Sea to the Desert Coasts, Deserts\n\nBuilding Sea City is a massive and challenging…\n\n28.66\n\n48.388\n\nSabah Al Ahmad Sea City, Kuwait Off 3391\n\nBuilding Sea City is a massive and challenging engineering project that requires constant innovation. As seen in the 1994 image from Landsat, the area is a natural estuary with tidal creeks. The design of Sea City follows these existing tidal creeks to bring water inland from the Gulf.\n\nThe first phase of construction began in 2003. The 2004 Landsat image shows the first artificial waterway. Eventually, the sea will be brought inland to the desert by about 9 kilometers on what was once desolate unusable salt marsh. The lagoons created are 3–4 meters deep on average.\n\nThe water in the lagoons needs to be flushed and kept circulating so it doesn’t become stagnant. With the Gulf’s tidal range of 2.7 meters, this flushing happens in the waterways of Sea City naturally. Farther inland, however, tidal action needs a little help. Giant gates help control the flow of the tides and ensure circulation of the entire lagoon system. It works like a natural pump. Testing of the seawater has shown that its quality is excellent.\n\nBrunt Ice Shelf, Antarctica Glaciers\n\nOne of the most studied ice shelves in…\n\n-75.631\n\n-26.5\n\nBrunt Ice Shelf, Antarctica On 3482\n\nOne of the most studied ice shelves in Antarctica has recently seen big changes. While the calving process is a normal part of an ice shelf’s lifecycle, recent rifting and iceberg calving may mean that the Brunt Ice Shelf is in a period of instability. It could also be an indicator of the future of other ice shelves in this region.\n\nLandsat satellites have watched the ice shelf for nearly five decades. In 1971, a calving event reduced its extent. This occurred just before the first Landsat launched in 1972, so the earliest Landsat observations of Brunt came during the Antarctic summer of 1972–1973.\n\nAnd now, Landsat 9 has joined Landsat 8 in observing the changing rifts on the ice shelf.\n\nBuraydah Cities, Deserts\n\nThe smaller city of Buraydah, northwest of…\n\n24.7117\n\n46.7242\n\nRiyadh, Saudi Arabia Off 3456\n\nThe smaller city of Buraydah, northwest of Riyadh, shows the same pattern of urban growth and agricultural development. From 1972 to 1986, the population of Buraydah almost tripled, from 60,000 to about 180,000 people. The rapid growth continued, and the population was 378,422 in 2004 and 669,000 in 2020. The 48-year increase is over 1,000%.\n\nNew roads are visible in these images, and irrigated land has increased. Buraydah and Riyadh both lie in Saudi Arabia’s central corridor of settlement and development.\n\nBurn Mapping Fires, Natural-Disasters\n\nAfter a wildland fire, scientists at the USGS…\n\n46.1784\n\n-121.3653\n\nCougar Creek Fire, Washington, USA Off 3255\n\nAfter a wildland fire, scientists at the USGS EROS Center quickly begin working on preliminary soil burn severity assessments. They provide results of this work to Department of Interior (DOI) Burned Area Emergency Response (BAER) teams and other local federal land managers. BAER teams consist of an interdisciplinary group of scientists that evaluate the effects of wildland fires and develop mitigation plans to protect valuable natural resources, protect human life and property, and promote landscape recovery.\n\n“The soil burn severity map is a critical component for many of the BAER team postfire hazard mitigation prescriptions,” says Randy McKinley, a geographer with the USGS EROS Center, who routinely maps fires on DOI-managed lands for the Bureau of Land Management, National Park Service, Bureau of Indian Affairs, and the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service.\n\nThe burn severity map, also called a Burned Area Reflectance Classification (BARC) map, is created using digital image processing techniques developed by USGS, USFS, and other scientists. The BARC is a preliminary soil burn severity map that is field validated and refined by the BAER team. The final map provides a synoptic view of large fires that is not easily obtained in a timely manner on the ground.\n\nThe BARC map is made by comparing NIR and SWIR spectral band values. NIR light is largely reflected by healthy green vegetation. SWIR light is largely reflected by ash and bare soil. The burn map exploits the relationship between these two bands. The best way to do this is to measure the relationship between these bands prefire and then again postfire. The areas where the relationship between the two bands has changed the most are most likely to be severely burned. The areas where that relationship has changed little are likely to be unburned or very lightly burned.\n\nFor example, Landsat 8 helped map destruction caused by the Cougar Creek fire near Mount Adams, 75 miles northeast of Portland, Oregon, which started on August 10, 2015. In the three images to the left, snow appears cyan on its peak. The postfire Landsat image from September 11, 2015, shows where the previous green vegetation south and east of the mountain is now charred and appears in shades of red. In the burn severity map, dark green is non-burned, light blue is low burn severity, yellow is moderate severity, and red is high.\n\nThe timely delivery of BARC maps, generally in less than 2 days after image acquisition, would not be possible without the USGS capability to efficiently downlink, process, and distribute Landsat and other satellite data. USGS hydrologists and soil scientists routinely request BARC products to obtain a better understanding of postfire erosion and water quality issues. McKinley adds, “BARC maps have also proven to be a crucial data layer for the modeling and prediction of potentially destructive postfire debris flows.”\n\nEROS responds to dozens of requests for burn mapping support each year. It’s not possible to get such a quick and complete assessment without satellite imagery. Landsat’s 30-m resolution is optimal for providing the detail suitable for landscape scale wildland fire mapping. When Landsat data are not available, imagery from the NASA EO-1 satellite, ESA’s Sentinel-2, and satellite sensors such as Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer (ASTER) and Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) provide options for developing a complete picture of landscape change caused by wildland fire.\n\nBurning Man Deserts, Water\n\nA unique event takes place every year on the…\n\n40.7861\n\n-119.207\n\nBlack Rock Playa, Nevada, USA Off 3054\n\nA unique event takes place every year on the playa. Burning Man is a weeklong arts and culture festival that ends on the Saturday of Labor Day weekend with the burning of a huge wooden effigy.\n\nPart of the event is the construction of a temporary metropolis named Black Rock City. Building of the temporary town starts about 6 weeks before the event. This is the most visible product of the event in satellite images.\n\nBesides the city’s radial roadways, the images show a pentagon surrounding the city. This “trash fence” catches wind-blown garbage to keep it from spreading throughout the playa. A major policy of Burning Man is to leave no trace. All debris must be cleaned up after the event is over. Participants must pick up all MOOP, which stands for Matter Out Of Place. The BLM, which grants the license for the event, monitors the cleanup.\n\nA Landsat 8 image from October 16, 2018, shows not only the temporary nature of the metropolis but also that cleanup is evidently still in progress on that date.\n\nBurning Man began in 1986 in California with 20 attendees and a 2.4-meter effigy. The festival’s first year at Black Rock Playa was in 1990, when the event had outgrown its California beach location. The temporary city that year had a population of 350 and the effigy was 12 meters tall. The 2018 event included 70,000 people. In recent years, the height of the entire effigy has exceeded 30 meters.\n\nUsually located in the southern portion of the playa, the festival location changes slightly every year. Can you find the festival location in the 1996 image? (Look in the upper right of that image.) How about in 1999? (Extreme southwestern part of the playa.)\n\nThe city becomes easier to spot as the event grows larger. In the 2018 image, Black Rock City spans nearly 5 kilometers across. But its area covers only about 3 percent of the entire playa.\n\nBurning Man went virtual in 2020 due to COVID-19. Its temporary city was absent from satellite imagery on Labor Day weekend for the first time in decades. After another year without a festival on the playa in 2021, Burning Man returned in 2022.\n\nCheck out this hi-resolution aerial image from the National Agriculture Imagery Program (NAIP) of Burning Man 2019.\n\nCalama Mining\n\nAs expected in the Atacama Desert, Landsat…\n\n-22.298\n\n-68.905\n\nChuquicamata Mine, Chile Off 3087\n\nAs expected in the Atacama Desert, Landsat doesn’t detect much vegetation—only some green along the Río Loa and next to the city of Calama. Calama has seen a rising population because of the influx of mine workers. The images show this visible urban area expansion. Notice the airport expansion that took place between the 2010 and 2016 images.\n\nPopulation of Calama Year Population 2020 190,336 2017 171,875 2012 160,794 2007 151,296 2002 142,211\n\nCan You Tell the Ridges from the Valleys?

Can you tell the peaks (that is, the ridges) from the valleys? It may seem easy, but you may be tricked by a common optical illusion in satellite images called relief inversion.\n\nAll Landsat images are designed to be morning views, so all of these images were taken in the morning. The Sun is to the east and south, so these images are lit from below and to the right. This causes the western and northwestern slopes to appear dark because they face the sun less squarely, and so are less illuminated.\n\nHowever, we unconsciously expect to see images lit from above. This tricks the brain into believing that mountains are valleys or that craters are mountains. If you look at the image upside-down, with the sun angle generally from the top of the image, you will probably see the image differently.\n\nCanal Cities\n\nOn the east end of the largest portion of the…\n\n32.625\n\n110.814\n\nShiyan, China Off 3322\n\nOn the east end of the largest portion of the Danjiangkou Reservoir, a bright line extends to the east and north. This canal takes water from the reservoir 1,400 kilometers to Beijing. This water will benefit over 100 million people.\n\nConstruction of this central route of the South-North Water Transfer Project began in December 2003. Beijing began receiving water from the reservoir via the canal in 2014. The entire project is the biggest interbasin transfer scheme in the world.\n\nCanals and Levees Agriculture, Cities, Mining, Water, Wetlands\n\nHistorically, water flowed slowly southward…\n\n25.95\n\n-80.65\n\nThe Everglades and Miami, Florida, USA Off 3435\n\nHistorically, water flowed slowly southward through the Everglades in a wide swath. Record floods in 1947 and 1948 led to the construction of a massive flood control project. It served to prevent flooding and store water during dry periods. It also allowed for further development of the growing urban area on the Atlantic coastal ridge.\n\nThe project established three Water Conservation Areas (WCAs), one of which is the Loxahatchee National Wildlife Refuge. These areas are delineated in the Landsat images, clearly divided by the levees and canals. Also visible are the Big Cypress National Preserve, Everglades National Park, and Everglades Agricultural Area.\n\nAnother part of the project is the 100-mile-long eastern perimeter levee, a 3- to 6-meter high earthen berm built to prevent flooding of farmland and urban areas. It runs along the eastern edge of the WCAs, marking a clear separation between the WCAs and urban areas such as Miami, Fort Lauderdale, and Coral Springs.\n\nAlong with facilitating the further growth of the urban areas of greater Miami, the other upshot of the project was that the natural flow of water was interrupted, changing the hydrology of the region. The gradual sheet flow of freshwater is diminished, and instead sudden pulses of water are delivered by the canals. These sudden releases caused decreases in the numbers of fish species.\n\nCape Cod, Massachusetts, USA Coasts, Water\n\nAlong some coastlines, long, narrow islands…\n\n41.647\n\n-69.9535\n\nCape Cod, Massachusetts, USA On 3068\n\nAlong some coastlines, long, narrow islands stand guard. These barrier islands are attractive to tourists, but they also protect the mainland coast from storm surge and are important beach, dune, and marsh habitats. Those islands do take a beating though.\n\nThese images focus on the southeastern elbow of Cape Cod, Massachusetts. Wave action, currents, winds, and tides are constantly changing the barrier islands here. Strong storms can change them quite suddenly.\n\nIn 1984, a nearly unbroken barrier island lines the Massachusetts coast at Chatham. To the south, Monomoy Island extends into the ocean like a teardrop. The other subsections of this Earthshots page show over 35 years of changes to these barrier islands as seen by three different Landsat satellites.\n\nCatfish Farms, Mississippi, USA Aquaculture\n\nFarming doesn’t always mean tilling the ground…\n\n33.311206\n\n-90.621333\n\nCatfish Farms, Mississippi, USA On 3490\n\nFarming doesn’t always mean tilling the ground for crops. In the flat valley along the Mississippi River, in a distinctive region of northwestern Mississippi referred to as “the Delta,” rich soils do support agriculture. But the flat land and abundant groundwater are also suited to aquaculture. Aquaculture simply means cultivating aquatic plants or fish for food. In this part of Mississippi, it means catfish farming.\n\nCatfish are raised in Arkansas and Alabama, but Mississippi has led the nation in catfish production since the 1980s. The farm-raised catfish eat high-protein food pellets made of soybeans, corn, wheat, vitamins, and minerals. The pellets float on top of the water, so the fish don’t eat like wild bottom-feeding catfish do. The result is healthier fish with a cleaner, milder taste.\n\nThe Mississippi River meanders down the left side of these Landsat images. Green indicates vegetation: Bright green shapes are cropland, and darker green shades are forests. Surface water is dark blue. Besides the Mississippi, other streams and oxbow lakes are scattered across the region. The catfish ponds are the distinctive blue squares and rectangles among the cropland. The washed-out pink areas are harvested fields.\n\nCatfish Ponds Aquaculture\n\nThe catfish industry grew rapidly in the 1980s…\n\n33.311206\n\n-90.62133\n\nCatfish Farms, Mississippi, USA Off 3491\n\nThe catfish industry grew rapidly in the 1980s and 1990s. The blue-tinted shapes in the Landsat images mark the ponds where the whiskered fish are raised. The ponds are built above ground with levees, and the water in the ponds is 4–6 feet deep.\n\nCatfish pond acreage reduced by more than half from 2003 to 2013. Rising costs and low-priced imports from China and Vietnam led to the decline.\n\nAt the same time, increased productivity from technological efficiencies led to higher yields and less land needed for the ponds. Among those efficiencies was the development of a hybrid catfish species, a mix of Ictalurus punctatus (channel catfish) and Ictalurus furcatus (blue catfish).\n\nThe hybrid grows faster, is easier to harvest, and has greater tolerance to crowding, so less area is needed to grow more fish. The business term for that is “increased operational intensity.”\n\nOther technological efficiencies reduced costs and spurred growth in the 2010s, including electric paddlewheel aerators, automated oxygen monitors, and pumps to circulate the water. Ponds are now divided into separate sections for treating wastewater and for the fish. These split ponds make treating the water more efficient.\n\nCattle Corridors Agriculture\n\nSome of the dark lines in the images might…\n\n14.064\n\n-3.47\n\nSeno Plain, Mali Off 3336\n\nSome of the dark lines in the images might look like roads. Those lines are a transportation network of sorts, just not transportation for people. They are cattle corridors that connect grazing lands (dark patches) and sometimes connect to villages. They are lined with hedges to keep the cattle out of the crops.\n\nOne line that goes all the way across these images is indeed a road. It passes through the city of Bankass. But the other lines are cattle corridors.\n\nCauses and Plans Deserts, Water, Wetlands\n\nThe diversion of water from the rivers for…\n\n37.5653\n\n45.449\n\nLake Urmia, Iran Off 3366\n\nThe diversion of water from the rivers for agricultural use is probably the most significant cause of Lake Urmia’s decline. Several dams have also been built on rivers that flow into the lake. Since 1996, droughts have further contributed to the lower lake levels.\n\nRainfall in 2018-19 brought water levels back up. That rainfall did not bring a permanent restoration of the lake, as the 2023 image shows.\n\nNo single fix can help the lake recover. But the continual monitoring from Landsat helps decision makers plan for the best solutions.\n\nCauses of Land Loss Coasts, Water, Wetlands\n\nHigh-resolution imagery from the WorldView…\n\n29.3924\n\n-90.4870\n\nIsle de Jean Charles, Louisiana, USA Off 3347\n\nHigh-resolution imagery from the WorldView satellite and aerial photos show details that moderate resolution satellite imagery cannot. The result of the land loss and its effect on Isle de Jean Charles becomes clear in these images.\n\nThe loss of land in southern Louisiana has several causes.\n\nDams Upriver, dams trap sediment that normally flowed to the delta and built it up.\n\nSubsidence The land in the Louisiana delta has always sunk naturally. Faults contribute to regional subsidence, and sediments naturally compress over time. Deposits flowing from the Mississippi River continually replenished and built up the land. Much of this sediment is now trapped by upstream dams, taking away the rebuilding process.\n\nSea level rise The long-term gradual rise in sea level combined with that subsidence increases the land loss more than either factor alone.\n\nCanals 10,000 miles of canals dug through the marshland, built for oil and gas production activities, bring saltwater farther inland, which degrades freshwater marshlands.\n\nHurricanes Storm surge and waves can propagate farther inland because of land loss, making matters worse. Hurricanes erode the soft land from the coast and can damage both vulnerable and healthy marshlands.\n\nThe saltwater that washes farther inland also invades the soil and has made the area no longer good for farming. As the marshland retreats, the saltwater enters bald cypress swamp and kills the trees.\n\nIsland Road\n\nThe only road into or out of the island is the 2-mile-long Island Road. When it was built in 1953, land and marsh surrounded it. Tribal members hunted and trapped on the land around the road. It now cuts across open water. It often submerges during high tide, and erosion continues to eat away at the roadbed.\n\nChange Animation Cities, Deserts, Water\n\nIf you could speed up time and watch a fast-…\n\n36.2551\n\n-115.2383\n\nLas Vegas, Nevada, USA Off 3062\n\nIf you could speed up time and watch a fast-growing city like Las Vegas change, what would it look like? From the perspective of the Landsat satellites, it’s a stunning lesson in urban growth. Watch Las Vegas’ rapid expansion in these Landsat images dating back to 1972.\n\nIn each image, bright red indicates actively growing vegetation. This makes golf courses easy to spot, and their development can be tracked along with the residential areas that surround them.\n\nThe desert landscape gradually becomes covered with streets, highways, and development as time goes on. A plot of very light tan can sometimes be seen right before a new residential area is built. This indicates a clearing of the land.\n\nOther natural bright areas also appear around the urban development. The bright reflection indicates the presence of salts, minerals, and clays in the sediment. Water once settled in these flat, lower elevation areas and these minerals remained. The brown-tan regions surrounding the city are likely steeper slopes where flowing water rinsed out those minerals. Darker tones indicate coarser material, and lighter tones are fine material such as clays that have a higher reflectance.\n\nEach image represents one year from 1972 to 2023. Landsats 1–5 and Landsat 7–9 are represented, which demonstrates the value of the past Landsat data along with new data for monitoring change over time. Landsat images are available to the public at no cost at the USGS Global Visualization Viewer (http://glovis.usgs.gov) or EarthExplorer (http://earthexplorer.usgs.gov).\n\nDownload a .wmv file of the animation here.\n\nChangi Airport Cities, Coasts\n\nThe new shoreline extends east of the city all…\n\n1.3521\n\n103.8198\n\nSingapore Off 3249\n\nThe new shoreline extends east of the city all the way to the airport on the island’s tip. In the mid-1970s, the government moved the main international terminal from Paya Lebar to Changi, partly to allow more distance between the planes and new, higher skyscrapers downtown.\n\nIn the 1989 image, on the east end of the island, you can see the old and new runways, parallel and a few miles apart. Planes now land where once was only water. A further extension of the land on the eastern tip was built for Chengi Air Base, visible in the 2000 image and later.\n\nChasm 1 Glaciers\n\nA feature known as Chasm 1 is prominent in the…\n\n-75.631\n\n-26.5\n\nBrunt Ice Shelf, Antarctica Off 3484\n\nA feature known as Chasm 1 is prominent in the Landsat imagery. This crack reactivated in December 2012 after no movement for 35 years. The Landsat images show rapid growth of the chasm, especially in 2018 and 2019, as it extended toward the McDonald Ice Rumples.\n\nIn early 2019, Chasm 1 was extending north as fast as 4 kilometers per year, and from 2012 to 2021, the rift widened almost three-fold.\n\nOn January 22, 2023, an iceberg the size of Houston finally broke off the shelf. Landsat images show the area a day before the break and a few days after. The new iceberg, named A-81, will be carefully tracked by satellites as it floats into the Weddell Sea.\n\nThe time series of images also shows Chasm 1 moving westward with the flow of the ice shelf.\n\nCheckerboard Pattern Forests\n\nThe close-up Landsat images that accompany…\n\n43.2259\n\n-123.6700\n\nLogging in Oregon, USA Off 3415\n\nThe close-up Landsat images that accompany this section show an obvious checkerboard pattern in the forest. These lands are known as “O&C” lands, which stands for Oregon and California Railroad. Land granted to O&C in 1866 was every other square mile, which formed the checkerboard pattern seen in the imagery. These lands now belong to the federal government, managed by the Bureau of Land Management (BLM).\n\nIn these images, the squares that remain dark green generally are lands that belong to the BLM. In some of those squares, there is clearcutting and regrowth taking place in this time frame. Adjacent squares, however, have a more noticeable change in tan or white spots, indicating more frequent clearcuts in the logging/reforestation cycle.\n\nView an animation of this area to see the changes as they happen.\n\nChernobyl, Ukraine Agriculture, Wildlife\n\nA nuclear accident devastated the region near…\n\n51.2619\n\n30.2360\n\nChernobyl, Ukraine On 3229\n\nA nuclear accident devastated the region near Chernobyl, Ukraine, on April 26, 1986. These images show the area around the nuclear power plant three days after the accident, and then years and decades after the accident.\n\nThe Landsat 5 image from April 29, 1986, was the first civilian satellite image of the accident. The data from Landsat were used to help confirm that an explosion had happened at Chernobyl and that the plant had been shut down.\n\nCheyenne Bottoms, Kansas, USA Agriculture, Water, Wetlands, Wildlife\n\nCheyenne Bottoms in central Kansas is the…\n\n38.455\n\n-98.68\n\nCheyenne Bottoms, Kansas, USA On 3501\n\nCheyenne Bottoms in central Kansas is the largest inland wetland in the United States. A 41,000-acre natural basin, the wetland is a key stopover for a multitude of migrating birds to eat and rest. The Cheyenne Bottoms Wildlife Area covers nearly half of the basin.\n\nThe wetland’s water level changes with precipitation and surface flows. For example, 2007 was a wet year, and 2013 was a dry year until heavy rain in late summer partially replenished the marshland.\n\nThe lines in the basin are roads on top of dikes, built in the 1950s to impound water in five pools and manage water levels. Further subdivision of the wetland pools took place in the 1990s. Water levels in individual pools are periodically flooded or drained to control invasive vegetation (such as hybrid cattails) and promote desirable aquatic vegetation. Additionally, small grains such as Japanese millet are sometimes seeded to provide supplemental food resources, then flooded to make the food available to foraging waterfowl.\n\nThe crops surrounding Cheyenne Bottoms include alfalfa, sorghum, wheat, corn, and soybeans, along with pasture.\n\nTwo intermittent streams, Blood and Deception creeks, flow into the Bottoms from the northwest. Canals were built to divert water from the Arkansas River and Wet Walnut Creek to provide a source of supplemental water to the wetland. However, drought kept the Bottoms dry in 2022.\n\nChuquicamata Mine, Chile Mining\n\nThe Atacama Desert of northern Chile has…\n\n-22.298\n\n-68.905\n\nChuquicamata Mine, Chile On 3084\n\nThe Atacama Desert of northern Chile has minimal vegetation. But it has ample mineral wealth: large amounts of copper, gold, silver, and other industrial metals. This includes the world’s largest open pit copper mine and the second deepest open pit—the Chuquicamata Mine.\n\nIn operation since 1910, the largest open pit at the mine measures 1 kilometer deep, 3 kilometers wide, and 5 kilometers long. New York City’s Central Park could fit inside it.\n\nEvidence shows that copper has been extracted in the region for centuries. Indigenous people worked the copper deposits in pre-Hispanic times to make weapons and tools. The mine now produces 650,000 metric tons of copper annually.\n\nCity Growth Cities, Deserts\n\nNouakchott was a small fishing village for…\n\n18.07\n\n-15.97\n\nNouakchott, Mauritania Off 3216\n\nNouakchott was a small fishing village for hundreds of years. As recently as 1950, it had only about 200 residents. Drought throughout the 1970s brought migrants to the city, and its population swelled to about 150,000 in 1980. It now has just over 1 million people, and its urbanized area has changed from 5 km2 in 1965 to 150 km2 in 2016.\n\nA 1965 close-up of Nouakchott from the Corona satellite shows the extent of the city at that time. Since then, the city’s expansion has been horizontal, spreading outward. Much of city’s urban growth occurs in informal settlements, which can be seen in the later Landsat images in the varying patterns of urban areas. Streets go in multiple directions and sprawl unevenly across the desert from the city’s center.\n\nThis may be against conventional wisdom, but this growing city in the desert is at high risk for flooding. The city is mostly below sea level and vulnerable to rising groundwater levels, seawater intrusions, porous soils, sand extractions, and heavy rains in low-lying areas.\n\nIn recent years, the number of rainy days has been increasing. The biggest problem is that a large amount of rain can fall in a short period of time. Since the groundwater level is high, and the type of soil there is not very good at absorbing even a small amount of rain water, rain cannot infiltrate into the ground. These factors lead to a city at high risk. In fact, heavy rains in August 2013 caused flooding in Nouakchott and south-central Mauritania.\n\nClearcutting Forests\n\nA logging strategy that’s easy to spot in the…\n\n43.2259\n\n-123.6700\n\nLogging in Oregon, USA Off 3414\n\nA logging strategy that’s easy to spot in the Landsat imagery is clearcutting. All the trees in an area are harvested, and then replanting begins immediately. Replanting must be completed within 2 years of harvest. In Oregon, about 40 million new trees are planted each year. According to the Oregon Forest Resources Institute, the reforestation success rate is 95% on private land.\n\nClearcutting is a major change to the forest. Clearcuts look unattractive, and they disrupt wildlife habitat. The clearcut area can also increase streamflow in that area, and the soil can erode more quickly until reforestation occurs. Therefore, in Oregon, the size of clearcuts is limited to 120 acres. They are also limited further when near highways. Forested buffers must be maintained along streams, lakes, and wetlands. This protects against possible increased streamflow erosion and maintains wildlife habitat.\n\nThere are actually some positive effects to clearcuts. They create open space in the forest that many plants and animals need to flourish. The full sun promotes rapid regrowth of Douglas fir and other species that need full sun. Also, clearcuts are generally temporary. Oregon requires prompt reforestation.\n\nCold War Craters Deserts\n\nLandsat 8’s near-infrared and…\n\n37.0888\n\n-116.0413\n\nYucca Flat, Nevada, USA Off 3472\n\nLandsat 8’s near-infrared and shortwave infrared imaging shows the pockmarked desert, perhaps more reminiscent of other planetary bodies than Earth. The age of the craters just about spans the entire Cold War. The first underground test was November 29, 1951; the last September 23, 1992.\n\nDespite the hundreds of tests conducted throughout the Cold War years, only about 7% of the Nevada Test Site has been disturbed.\n\nWhile nuclear explosions no longer rock the site, now called the Nevada National Security Site, nuclear weapons research still takes place there based on those tests. Computer simulations can help predict what happens during explosions.\n\nThe craters have also been used as Mars analog craters. Since access to the site is restricted, the craters are relatively undisturbed. That, along with the dry climate, helps scientists better understand craters on Mars, especially the types of craters that effectively expose near-surface material that Mars rovers and drones can study.\n\nColorful Composites Forests\n\nOn Earthshots we typically show “multispectral…\n\n43.2259\n\n-123.6700\n\nLogging in Oregon, USA Off 3417\n\nOn Earthshots we typically show “multispectral composites”—single-date images that combine three different wavelengths into one image. The example used in this section shows a different combination of infrared wavelengths than was used on the 2016 image from the “Interpret the Images” section. In this image, the clearcuts are pink against the bright green of the forest. This combination of infrared wavelengths makes the clearcuts that have occurred from one year to the next stand out more clearly.\n\nWe don’t often examine change over time in one image. That’s what the colorful image in this section shows. It’s a “multitemporal composite”—one image that shows three different dates combined. This image shows a combination of Landsat images from 1994, 2009, and 2016. Red shows clearcuts that were evident in the 1994 image. Green shows clearcuts that took place by 2009. And blue shows clearcuts that occurred by 2016. Darker tones are areas of forest that did not change in this time frame. This way of examining the imagery shows that logging has affected nearly the entire landscape shown, something that may not be evident when looking at a single-date image.\n\nPeople derive many ecological and economic benefits from forests, and Landsat can help forest managers monitor changes to ensure these resources are available for future generations.\n\nColumbia Glacier, Alaska, USA Glaciers, Water\n\nSome landscape changes around the world happen…\n\n61.0776\n\n-147.0735\n\nColumbia Glacier, Alaska, USA On 3243\n\nSome landscape changes around the world happen at glacial pace—very slowly—and have not been captured in the satellite era. However, glacial pace would not describe the changes to Alaska’s Columbia Glacier over the past few decades.\n\nColumbia Glacier is a large tidewater glacier that flows south out of the Chugach Mountains in Alaska to Prince William Sound. Since 1980, its terminus has retreated 20 kilometers to make it one of the most rapidly changing glaciers in the world.\n\nWhen it was surveyed by British explorers in 1794, Columbia’s terminus was at the northern edge of Heather Island. It stayed there until 1980, when its current rapid retreat began. A 300-meter deep fjord now replaces the portion of the valley once occupied by the glacier.\n\nThis series of Landsat images shows the rapid retreat, including an acceleration of the retreat in the early 1990s, followed by slowdowns in 1994–1997 and 2000–2006. It has picked up the pace of retreat again since 2006. Columbia has also become narrower, as shown by the expansion of bedrock areas in the images.\n\nThe false-color images use shortwave-infrared, near-infrared, and green wavelengths to highlight these changes, where snow and ice appear cyan, vegetation is green, open water is dark, and exposed bedrock is brown.\n\nWhy this matters\n\nLand-based ice flowing into the ocean from tidewater glaciers is a leading cause of sea level rise. A 2015 study found that Columbia Glacier sent about 4 gigatons (billions of tons) of ice into the ocean every year from 1994 to 2013. An increasing rate of iceberg calving can also pose a danger to ships in shipping lanes.\n\nContact Information\n\nCustomer Services\n\nU.S. Geological…\n\nAbout Earthshots Off 3074\n\nCustomer Services\n\nU.S. Geological Survey\n\nEarth Resources Observation and Science (EROS) Center\n\n47914 252nd Street\n\nSioux Falls, SD 57198-0001\n\nTel: 800-252-4547\n\nTel: 605-594-6151\n\nEmail: erosoutreach@usgs.gov\n\nBusiness Hours: Monday through Friday, 8:00 a.m. to 4:00 p.m., central time\n\nhttps://www.usgs.gov/centers/eros\n\nThe satellite images presented on the Earthshots Web site are not intended to be used for scientific interpretation, only for educational purposes.

Landsat 5’s thermal infrared band shows that heated water as orange, then gradually turning yellow then blue as it cools. But the image from April 29 indicates all the water in the pond is the same temperature, evidence the plant was not operating. As the first civilian satellite to image the disaster, Landsat 5 helped confirm the disaster had happened, and this was part of the evidence.\n\nIn just the past few years, the cooling pond by the former power plant began drying up. Satellite images clearly reveal a rapid decrease in water level.\n\nSoon after the accident in 1986, radioactive material entered the pond from atmospheric fallout. The contamination went into the pond’s sediment and was shielded by the water. In 2014, the Ukraine stopped pumping water into the pond from the Pripyat River in order to save money. The consequence of this action could be to expose radioactive sediment to the air where it can be dispersed by the wind.\n\nCougar Creek Fire, Washington, USA Fires, Natural-Disasters\n\nWildland fires can leave behind scorched…\n\n46.1784\n\n-121.3653\n\nCougar Creek Fire, Washington, USA On 3254\n\nWildland fires can leave behind scorched mountainsides with no trees or other vegetation to stop rain-driven mudslides or dangerous debris flows. When such potential exists, the shortwave infrared (SWIR) and near-infrared (NIR) spectral bands of the Landsat satellite sensors help to identify those possibilities quickly.\n\nThe six images displayed show prefire conditions in 2014 and the progression of the Cougar Creek Fire in Washington on the eastern slopes of Mount Adams over the several days that it burned in 2015. Lightning started the fire on August 10, 2015, and it was not contained until mid-September. While it’s interesting to see the progression of the fire, it’s the prefire and postfire images that are really important for burn severity mapping.\n\n(Black stripes run through the Landsat 7 images because of the Scan Line Corrector failure on Landsat 7 in May 2003.)\n\nCropland Agriculture\n\nThese close-up images from Landsat show the…\n\n14.064\n\n-3.47\n\nSeno Plain, Mali Off 3324\n\nThese close-up images from Landsat show the Seno Plain in a bit more detail. The images were acquired during the dry season, so crops were not growing at the time. However, the images do show evidence of how intensely the land was being used for agriculture, indicated by the lighter toned patterns. As in the wider views, the Bandiagara escarpment is the feature on the left of these images.\n\nThe 1972 image shows that farmers practiced crop rotation, leaving some land fallow. The fallow fields are represented by dark patches. In 1986, however, much of the fallow is gone, and there is even less of it by 2016. Bright areas dominate the 2016 image, indicating wall-to-wall cropland over the plain. The darkest patches are grassy fallow areas and are either protected lands or used for cattle grazing.\n\nDallas-Fort Worth International Airport Cities\n\nDallas-Fort Worth International Airport,…\n\n32.8975\n\n-97.0409\n\nDallas, Texas, USA Off 3260\n\nDallas-Fort Worth International Airport, between Dallas and Fort Worth, opened the year of the first Landsat image shown here, 1974.

The caterpillars are hungry little buggers, and they’re not picky eaters. Even though they prefer oak and aspen, they feed on other deciduous trees such as maple, birch, poplar, willow, apple, and hawthorn, and can go after coniferous trees during a large outbreak.\n\nDuring a dense population boom, they eat all the leaves on a tree and can even defoliate entire stands of trees. Beginning in 2016, the combination of visible and infrared imaging from Landsat revealed the extent of the damage the outbreak has caused.\n\nHealthy forest is bright green, but as the time series progresses, much of the green turns to faded brown as the infestation spreads.\n\nThough spongy moth outbreaks are a fairly regular occurrence in the more southern portion of their invaded range, this outbreak was the first time spongy moths caused significant defoliation in New England since the 1980s.\n\nHow did they get here?\n\nAn amateur entomologist Etienne Léopold Trouvelot brought spongy moth eggs from France to Massachusetts in 1869. He was conducting experiments with the eggs possibly to see if the spongy moth could be an alternative to the native silkworm. The insects somehow escaped from his home and have affected the forests of the Northeastern United States ever since.\n\nDanjiangkou Reservoir Cities\n\nVisible in these images is one canal…\n\n32.625\n\n110.814\n\nShiyan, China Off 3321\n\nVisible in these images is one canal associated with the $62 billion South-North Water Transfer Project.
