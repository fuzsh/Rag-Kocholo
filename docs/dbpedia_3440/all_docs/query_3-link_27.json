        "text": "This chapter outlines the potential traffic and transport impacts associated with the M4-M5 Link project (the project). A detailed traffic and transport assessment has been prepared for the project and is included in Appendix H (Technical working paper: Traffic and transport). This chapter provides a summary of the technical working paper and details:\n\nThe assessment methodology and approach used to carry out the traffic and transport assessment\n\nThe existing traffic and transport environment within the study area\n\nFuture traffic and transport conditions without the project\n\nPotential impacts of the project on the road network during construction and operation\n\nRecommended safeguards and management measures to avoid, minimise and/or mitigate potential traffic and transport impacts.\n\nThe Secretary of the NSW Department of Planning and Environment (DP&E) has issued environmental assessment requirements for the project. These are referred to as Secretary’s Environmental Assessment Requirements (SEARs). Table 8-1 sets out these requirements and the associated desired performance outcomes as they relate to traffic and transport, and identifies where they have been addressed in this environmental impact statement (EIS).\n\n8.1 Assessment methodology\n\nThe transport network in Sydney is expected to be put under increasing pressure over the next 20 years. A Plan for Growing Sydney (NSW Government 2014) indicated that from 2011 to 2031, Sydney’s population is forecast to increase from 4.3 to 5.9 million, which equates to an average of around 80,000 additional residents per year. Moreover, by 2036, the number of trips made around Sydney each day is forecast to increase by 31 per cent from 16 to 21 million vehicle movements. This growth will place increasing pressure on the NSW transport network and the key travel demand corridors connecting regional cities and major centres across the greater Sydney metropolitan area, as shown in Figure 8-1.\n\nKey corridors currently accommodate high levels of daily traffic including freight, commuter and leisure travel. Users of these corridors frequently experience congestion and delay, particularly during weekday and weekend peak periods. Both the NSW Long Term Transport Master Plan (Transport for NSW 2012) and the State Infrastructure Strategy Update 2014 (State Infrastructure Strategy) (Infrastructure NSW 2014) identified the need to plan and invest in the future of Sydney’s motorway network, which provides vital infrastructure connections within and between key travel demand corridors. Any investment in motorway infrastructure must be aligned with supporting public and active transport initiatives to achieve an increase in capacity, while aiming to reduce the reliance on and demand for private vehicles on the future road network.\n\nThe WestConnex project is one part of a broader solution to these growing pressures. While public transport is also part of the overall transport plan, it is recognised that not all trips across Sydney can be served by public transport, especially trips to dispersed destinations, commercial trips requiring the movement of large or heavy goods/materials or trade and service-related journeys. In addition, Sydney is home to two-thirds of NSW’s manufacturing sector, with many of the state’s major aviation, pharmaceutical, biotechnology, electronics and automotive industries based in western Sydney. These businesses rely heavily on the road network and its connectivity to the port and airport precincts.\n\nA congested road network also affects public transport; with bus travel times experiencing the same delays as other road users. Providing new, tunnel alternatives to sections of the arterial road network will improve road-based public transport travel times and provide opportunities for new rapid transit options.\n\nFor these reasons, the NSW Government is investing in light rail, metro, bus rapid transit and motorways to provide a multi-modal response to current and future transport challenges. In this context, WestConnex is also an enabler of integrated transport and land use planning, supporting the development of initiatives including The Bays Precinct and the Parramatta Road Corridor Urban Transformation Strategy.\n\nThe key strategic traffic objectives of the project are to:\n\nProvide an efficient motorway link between the M4 and M5 motorways and improve traffic flow on the motorway network\n\nEnable long term motorway network development, including facilitating new cross-harbour capacity and connections to Sydney’s south\n\nImprove accessibility and reliability of commercial vehicle movement in the M4 and M5 corridors to economic centres, including to Sydney Airport and Port Botany economic zone\n\nImprove traffic conditions and ease future congestion on the inner western and south-western network, including Parramatta Road, supporting urban regeneration and growth\n\nImprove overall network productivity.\n\nA detailed discussion of the strategic context and justification for the project is provided in Chapter 3 (Strategic context and project need). This includes a description of transport policies, strategies and plans that are relevant to the project and the WestConnex program of works. A description of the alternatives to the project, which explains how and why the project design was selected as the preferred option for assessment in this EIS is provided in Chapter 4 (Project development and alternatives).\n\nFigure 8-1 Sydney travel demand corridors\n\n8.1.2 Traffic forecasting and modelling process\n\nThe Technical working paper: Traffic and transport (Appendix H) has assessed the potential impacts of the project during construction and operation, including cumulative impacts associated with the WestConnex program of works, as well as the proposed future Sydney Gateway, Western Harbour Tunnel and Beaches Link and the F6 Extension projects.\n\nThe traffic and transport impact assessment undertaken for the project consisted of three key components:\n\nCharacterising the existing traffic and transport environment within the study area using a combination of data from Transport for NSW Transport Performance and Analytics and Roads and Maritime, traffic counts and survey data. A description of the study area for the traffic and transport assessment is included in section 8.1.4\n\nThe development and application of a regional strategic traffic model; the WestConnex Road Traffic Model (WRTM), to determine the anticipated future growth in traffic on the road network in the Sydney metropolitan area, based on planned and forecast changes in population and employment, and to understand the metropolitan-wide impacts of the project\n\nOperational modelling of the road network to determine the traffic and transport conditions in future years with and without the project on roads:\n\nAround the Wattle Street interchange\n\nOn the M4-M5 Link Motorway\n\nAround the Rozelle interchange\n\nAround St Peters interchange\n\nAround the construction ancillary facilities during construction of the project.\n\nThe study area for the traffic and transport assessment, as well as the methodology for undertaking these key traffic and transport assessments is discussed in section 8.1.4 to section 8.1.8.\n\n8.1.3 Relevant guidelines and policies\n\nThe following guidelines were followed in carrying out the traffic and transport assessment:\n\nGuide to Traffic Management – Part 3 Traffic Studies and Analysis (Austroads 2013)\n\nTraffic Modelling Guidelines (NSW Roads and Maritime Services (Roads and Maritime) 2013)\n\nGuide to Traffic Generating Developments Version 2.2 (NSW Roads and Traffic Authority (RTA) 2002).\n\n8.1.4 Study area\n\nThe study area for the traffic and transport assessment was informed by the forecast traffic and transport changes from the WRTM version 2.3 (WRTM v2.3), a strategic traffic model that covers the Sydney metropolitan area. The extent of the study area and the areas requiring operational modelling assessment were determined through analysis of forecast WRTM v2.3 traffic flow differences as a result of the project. This process allowed for identification of those areas of Sydney’s road network where the project was forecast to have a substantial impact (adverse or beneficial).\n\nThe study area for the traffic and transport assessment is shown in Figure 8-2 and broadly encompasses an area extending from the Parramatta River in the north to Sydney Airport in the south, and from the Eastern Distributor in the east to Haberfield and Marrickville in the west. The study area is predominantly focussed on the corridor between Haberfield and Rozelle, the corridor between Rozelle and St Peters, the corridor between Haberfield and St Peters, and the surface road networks around the Wattle Street, Rozelle and St Peters interchanges.\n\nChanges on strategic roads outside of this study area are assessed in the Sydney metropolitan road network sections in this chapter, and those outside the operational model areas are assessed through a screenline analysis, presented in section 8.3.3. Further justification of the study area is contained in Appendix H (Technical working paper: Traffic and transport).\n\n8.2.3 Wattle Street interchange to Rozelle interchange corridor\n\nThe Wattle Street interchange to Rozelle interchange corridor connects the M4 Motorway to the Sydney CBD and the north. East of the Wattle Street interchange, east–west traffic movement is focused on Dobroyd Parade/City West Link and Parramatta Road. City West Link then combines with Victoria Road and links to Anzac Bridge/Western Distributor to provide the main east-west movement to the east of the Rozelle interchange. Other routes from the Wattle Street interchange area to the Sydney CBD include along Great North Road/Lyons Road, Victoria Road and then Anzac Bridge.\n\nParramatta Road, as part of the corridor between the proposed Wattle Street interchange and the Sydney CBD, forms part of the Parramatta to Sydney CBD via Strathfield travel demand corridor.\n\nExisting traffic volumes and patterns\n\nMid-block traffic volumes\n\nATC surveys presented in Table 8-6 included locations on Parramatta Road within the Wattle Street interchange to Rozelle interchange corridor. The Parramatta Road corridor accommodates consistently high volumes of travel demand, with volumes consistent through an average weekday, both during and between the AM and PM peak periods. Victoria Road, in this area, also forms part of the Parramatta to Sydney CBD via Ryde travel demand corridor. This corridor is also one of the most congested road corridors in Sydney and one of Sydney’s busiest bus corridors.\n\nTable 8-13 provides the AM peak hour, PM peak hour and AWT flows for the key roads within the Wattle Street interchange to Rozelle interchange corridor. Count data was taken from 2014 to 2016 surveys. At some locations, only peak hour volumes were available.\n\nTable 8-13 Average peak mid-block traffic volumes at key locations within the Wattle Street interchange to Rozelle interchange corridor (2014–2016 count data)\n\nSource: Roads and Maritime traffic surveys (2014 – 2016)\n\nExisting road network performance\n\nAverage speed and travel times on Wattle Street/City West Link, Parramatta Road and Victoria Road are shown in Table 8-14. The low speeds and long travel times across both AM and PM peaks indicate the peak hour congestion currently experienced along the Wattle Street interchange to Rozelle interchange corridor.\n\nTable 8-14 Average speed and travel times along key roads within the Wattle Street interchange to Rozelle interchange corridor (2016 survey data)\n\n8.2.4 Rozelle interchange and surrounds\n\nThe proposed Rozelle interchange would be located in the vicinity of the Rozelle Rail Yards to the north of City West Link. Details on land use in the vicinity of the proposed Rozelle interchange are provided in Chapter 12 (Land use and property) of this EIS. The key roads in the vicinity of the Rozelle interchange are shown in Figure 8-7 and include (but are not limited to):\n\nCity West Link (A4)\n\nVictoria Road (A40)\n\nWestern Distributor/Anzac Bridge\n\nLilyfield Road\n\nCatherine Street\n\nThe Crescent/Minogue Crescent/Ross Street\n\nJohnston Street\n\nJames Craig Road\n\nRobert Street\n\nTerry Street.\n\nDetailed descriptions of these key roads are provided in Appendix H (Technical working paper: Traffic and transport).\n\nModes of travel\n\nThe Rozelle interchange is located primarily within the Inner West LGA. A small area within the City of Sydney is also located on the eastern side of The Crescent. Travel mode share for the Inner West LGA in comparison with the Sydney GMA is shown in Table 8-15.\n\nThe Inner West LGA has a higher share of public transport due to the area’s proximity to the Sydney CBD and frequent bus, heavy and light rail services. The largest difference to the Sydney GMA data is in ‘walk only’ trips, which account for 32 per cent of all trips in the Inner West LGA compared to 18 per cent in the Sydney GMA. This could be attributed to factors including the walkability of many neighbourhoods in the area.\n\nTable 8-15 Average weekday travel mode share for Inner West LGA\n\nNote:\n\nInner West Council data has been derived by combining data from the former Leichhardt, Ashfield and Marrickville LGAs Source: NSW Bureau of Transport Statistics (BTS), Household Travel Survey Report: Sydney 2012/13, Nov 2014 Release.\n\nPublic transport services\n\nThe Rozelle area has access to light rail and bus services that provide frequent connections to key centres and transport nodes, but does not have access to the heavy rail network.\n\nLight rail services\n\nThe L1 Dulwich Hill line runs from Central to Dulwich Hill via Pyrmont, Glebe, Lilyfield and Leichhardt. The closest stops are at Rozelle Bay and Lilyfield. The light rail line runs along a former freight railway corridor for most of its length, with a short on-street section in the southern part of the Sydney CBD between Darling Drive and Castlereagh Street. Table 8-16 shows the existing service frequency on the Dulwich Hill line, with services every eight to 10 minutes during peak periods.\n\nTable 8-16 Weekday light rail service frequency\n\nSource: Transport for NSW 2016\n\nBus services\n\nTable 8-17 presents the bus services and frequencies at Rozelle (all operated by Sydney Buses). Victoria Road serves as a major transit corridor between Sydney’s north-western suburbs and the Sydney CBD. Balmain Road is also a key cross-regional bus corridor linking Balmain with Rozelle and Leichhardt.\n\nTable 8-17 Bus services around Rozelle and surrounds\n\nNotes:\n\n17.00 am–9.00 am (higher frequency direction)\n\n24.00 pm–6.00 pm (higher frequency direction) Source: Sydney Buses 2016\n\nWalking and cycling facilities\n\nDetails of existing walking and cycling infrastructure and facilities can be found in Appendix N\n\n(Technical working paper: Active transport strategy).\n\nExisting traffic volumes and patterns\n\nMid-block traffic volumes\n\nTable 8-18 provides the 2016 AM peak hour, PM peak hour and AWT flows for key roads in the vicinity of the Rozelle interchange. Count data was taken from 2014 and 2016 surveys. The table indicates higher traffic flows in the southbound and eastbound (citybound) directions during the AM peak and in the opposite directions during the PM peak. The proportion of heavy vehicles is not significantly high in this area compared to other arterial routes in Sydney.\n\nTable 8-18 Average peak mid-block traffic volumes at key locations around Rozelle and surrounds (2014 and 2016 count data)\n\nSource: Roads and Maritime traffic surveys (2014 – 2016)\n\nRozelle interchange and surrounds existing performance\n\nNetwork performance\n\nTable 8-19 presents the performance of the modelled road network for Rozelle and surrounds in the 2015 base scenario for the AM and PM peak hours. The results indicate a similar level of demand in each peak hour. However, the AM peak hour results show longer average travel time, more stops and lower average speed per vehicle through the modelled network. This reflects more congestion in the AM peak hour compared to the PM peak hour.\n\nDuring the AM peak hour, the capacity constraints at Bathurst Street and Sydney Harbour Bridge have the most significant impacts on the eastbound movement on the Western Distributor with extensive congestion extending back to or across Anzac Bridge.\n\nTable 8-19 Rozelle interchange network performance – 2015 AM and PM peak hour\n\nIntersection performance\n\nTable 8-20 presents the modelled AM and PM peak hour LoS for key intersections in the existing situation at Rozelle. The intersection performance analysis demonstrates several intersections along Victoria Road at Rozelle experience poor levels of service during the PM peak hour. The poor level of service indicates that the intersections are at or close to capacity.\n\nTable 8-20 Rozelle interchange: key intersection performance (LOS) – 2015 AM and PM peak hour\n\nTravel times and speeds\n\nTable 8-21 shows the average travel time on Victoria Road and Anzac Bridge between Darling Street at Rozelle and the Pyrmont Bridge ramps at Pyrmont, in the AM and PM peak periods. In the peak directions, eastbound travel time in the AM peak averages about six minutes with an average speed of about 21 kilometres per hour on a typical weekday; while the westbound travel time in the PM peak averages about eight minutes with an average speed of about 18 kilometres per hour. The speed limit on these roads is 60 kilometres per hour.\n\nThe eastbound direction in the AM peak and the westbound direction in the PM peak experience the most congested conditions. This is illustrated in the longer travel times and slower speeds compared\n\nto the reverse direction in these same peak periods. Notwithstanding this, average speed in the eastbound direction in the PM peak is also slow.\n\nTable 8-21 Travel speed and travel time on Victoria Road and Anzac Bridge between Darling Street, Rozelle and Pyrmont Bridge entry/exit ramp at Pyrmont\n\nSource: Based on Matrix survey data, AECOM 2016\n\nTable 8-22 shows the average travel time on City West Link and Anzac Bridge between Catherine Street at Lilyfield and Pyrmont Bridge ramps at Pyrmont in the AM and PM peak periods. In the peak directions, eastbound travel time in the AM peak averages about 10 minutes, with an average speed of about 16 kilometres per hour on a typical weekday. The westbound travel time in the PM peak averages six minutes with an average speed of about 26 kilometres per hour. The speed limit on the road is 60 kilometres per hour.\n\nThe eastbound direction in the AM peak and the westbound direction in the PM peak show longer travel times and slower speeds compared to the reverse direction in these same peak periods. Compared to the Victoria Road surveys, the eastbound direction in the PM peak is less congested.\n\nTable 8-22 Travel speed and travel time on City West Link and Anzac Bridge between Catherine Street, Lilyfield and Pyrmont Bridge on/off ramp at Pyrmont\n\nSource: Based on Matrix survey data, 2014\n\nTraffic crashes\n\nTable 8-23 summarises the crash history for five years (1 January 2011 – 31 December 2015) on the key roads around the Rozelle interchange. On key arterial roads, including Anzac Bridge and City West Link, about 60 per cent of crashes were rear-end, which is consistent with roadways approaching capacity and on which a high level of queuing occurs.\n\nTable 8-23 Rozelle and surrounds: crash statistics (Jan 2011 to Dec 2015)\n\nSource: Summarised from crash reports, 2016\n\nThe average crash severity index on key roads in Rozelle and surrounds is about 1.29 – above the average for NSW (1.24) and the Sydney Metropolitan Area (1.22), as presented in Table 8-24.\n\nTable 8-24 Rozelle and surrounds: crash severity indices (Jan 2011 to Dec 2015)\n\nSource: Summarised from crash reports, 2016 & 2014\n\nTable 8-25 indicates that the occurrence of fatal crashes is higher on City West Link and Victoria Road compared to the Sydney Metropolitan Area average, while crashes causing injury on Victoria Road, Lilyfield Road, The Crescent and Johnston Street are higher than the Sydney Metropolitan Area average. Injury crashes on Anzac Bridge and City West Link are lower than the Sydney Metropolitan Area average.\n\nTable 8-25 Rozelle and surrounds: crash rates per 100MVKT (Jan 2011 to Dec 2015)\n\nSource: Summarised from crash reports, 2016\n\nTable 8-26 provides details of the crash costs for the key roads surrounding the Rozelle interchange. Average crash costs based on crash severity have been calculated using Roads and Maritime’s Economic Analysis Manual (Economic Parameters for 2009).\n\nTable 8-26 Rozelle and surrounds: crash costs (Jan 2011 to Dec 2015)\n\nSource: Summarised from crash reports, 2016\n\n8.2.5 Rozelle to St Peters interchange corridor\n\nThe Rozelle interchange to St Peters interchange corridor connects the Sydney CBD with the M5 motorway corridor. Southeast of the Rozelle interchange, north–south traffic movement is focused on the Eastern Distributor, with Abercrombie Street, Regent Street, Chalmers Street and Elizabeth Street providing supporting north–south routes. North of the St Peters interchange, north–south traffic is mainly focused on the Princes Highway and King Street, while traffic from the Sydney Airport and Port Botany precinct also uses O’Riordan Street and Botany Road.\n\nSeveral of the roads identified above are within the Sydney Airport to Sydney CBD travel demand corridor, which experiences high levels of transport congestion. There are also heavy vehicle routes along this corridor, extending from the Sydney Airport and Port Botany precinct, through the city, to areas north of Sydney Harbour.\n\nExisting traffic volumes and patterns\n\nTable 8-27 provides 2014 AM peak hour, PM peak hour and AWT flows at key locations within the Rozelle to St Peters interchange corridor.\n\nSouth-east of the Rozelle interchange, the main north–south movement is focused on the Eastern Distributor, with surrounding north–south links playing a supporting role. North of the St Peters interchange, traffic is mainly focused on Princes Highway and, to a lesser degree King Street, while O’Riordan Street and Botany Road also carry a significant amount of north–south traffic.\n\nTable 8-27 Average peak mid-block traffic volumes at key locations within the Rozelle interchange to St Peters interchange corridor (2014 count data)\n\nSource: WDA traffic surveys (2014)\n\nExisting road network performance\n\nAverage speeds and travel times on key roads within the Rozelle interchange to St Peters interchange corridor are shown in Table 8-28. Southern Cross Drive, posted at 80 kilometres per hour, exhibits slow speeds, especially in the peak directions. Traffic conditions on Botany Road and Princes Highway/King Street, posted at 50 or 60 kilometres per hour on different sections, indicate the congestion on the surface road network in this corridor.\n\nTable 8-28 Average speed and travel times along key roads within the Rozelle to St Peters interchange corridor (2016 survey data)\n\n8.3 Assessment of potential impacts\n\n8.3.1 Construction\n\nDuring construction, the project may affect the surrounding road network as a result of:\n\nConstruction vehicles using the surface road network, especially heavy vehicles transporting spoil\n\nSurface road works, requiring temporary traffic, cyclist and/or pedestrian diversions, road occupation and temporary road closures\n\nTemporary changes to speed limits.\n\nOverview of construction traffic and vehicle routes\n\nConstruction of the project would result in additional heavy and light vehicle movements on the road network in three broad categories:\n\nRemoval of spoil generated by construction activities\n\nHeavy vehicle deliveries and other heavy vehicles involved in construction activities\n\nLight vehicle movements associated with construction of the project.\n\nConstruction traffic routes for the project would use the existing motorway and arterial road network as much as possible, reducing traffic related impacts on local roads.\n\nSpoil would be transported from construction ancillary facilities to spoil management locations, generally along arterial roads and the M4 East Motorway, the New M5 Motorway, the M5 East Motorway and the M5 South West Motorway.\n\nConstruction traffic management and access\n\nConstruction traffic generation and distribution\n\nThe project would generate around four million cubic metres of spoil, the majority of which would be generated from excavation of the tunnels. As such, the primary facilities for receipt and dispatch of spoil would be the tunnel construction sites.\n\nThe project would seek to reuse at least 95 per cent of uncontaminated spoil, either within the project or at other locations. Where reasonable and practicable, spoil would be managed according to the following hierarchy:\n\nMinimisation of spoil generation through design and management\n\nReuse of spoil within the project\n\nBeneficial reuse of spoil outside the project\n\nWhere reuse is not possible, disposal of spoil would be the last resort.\n\nFive potential sites have been identified for receiving excess spoil from the project, as summarised in Table 8-41. Negotiations for the final destination(s) for excess spoil would be carried out during detailed design, and may include one or more of the sites listed in Table 8-41 or other alternatives.\n\nTable 8-41 Potential spoil management sites\n\nNote: The Horsley Park spoil management site is a manufacturing facility and currently does not have a definitive limit for the amount of spoil it can receive.\n\nIndicative haulage routes from the construction ancillary facilities are shown in Chapter 6 (Construction work) and in Appendix H (Technical working paper: Traffic and transport). Spoil haulage routes would be confirmed during detailed design. Delivery of concrete to support tunnel construction would originate from batching plants close to the project footprint, although other sources may also be required. Other materials required for construction would, where available, originate from within the Sydney region and surrounds and would be delivered by vehicles using the arterial road network to access the various construction sites.\n\nTable 8-42 provides details of light and heavy vehicle volumes predicted to arrive and depart from construction ancillary facilities during a typical AM peak hour, PM peak hour and daily period. Light vehicles are comprised of passenger and commercial vehicles. The table shows that the highest volumes of heavy and light construction vehicles are forecast at the Rozelle civil and tunnel site (C5). Construction vehicles would use the M4 East and New M5 tunnels at Haberfield and St Peters rather than the surface road network, wherever possible.\n\nThe daily and peak hour volumes shown in Table 8-42 are based around targeted spoil haulage between 7.00 am and 6.00 pm. However, 24 hour spoil haulage would be required during tunnelling at five construction ancillary facilities, and the table shows indicative heavy vehicle volumes for these sites. Spoil haulage would only occur during standard daytime construction hours at the Darley Road civil and tunnel site to minimise heavy vehicle movements at night at this location. The peak hour\n\nidentified is representative of highest estimated construction volumes and falls within the broader peak periods experienced on the network.\n\nConstruction workforce parking\n\nA number of the project’s staff and labour force would be expected to drive to construction sites and would therefore require car parking. The number of construction personnel requiring parking would vary over the duration of the construction program.\n\nIt is anticipated that construction workforce parking would be primarily provided at the following sites:\n\nNorthcote Street civil site (C3a) – around 150 car parking spaces (Option A)\n\nParramatta Road East civil site (C3b) – around 140 car parking spaces (Option B)\n\nRozelle civil and tunnel site (C5) – around 400 car parking spaces\n\nCampbell Road civil and tunnel site (C10) – around 150 car parking spaces.\n\nThese facilities would be used to provide worker parking and shuttle bus transfers to other nearby construction sites.\n\nDue to the generally constrained nature of the other construction sites, only minimal car parking for construction workers would be provided at these locations. Typically, these sites would provide between four to 20 parking spaces intended to be used by engineers and other construction management staff. Parking of construction-related vehicles in adjacent local roads would occur, particularly during site establishment.\n\nThe construction workforce would be encouraged to use public transport. Victoria Road and Parramatta Road are major transport corridors that have multiple bus routes. The Inner West Light Rail Line runs along the southern side of City West Link with stops near the Rozelle Rail Yards at Rozelle Bay and Lilyfield; and at the Darley Road civil and tunnel site (Leichhardt North light rail stop). The T3 Bankstown Line stops at St Peters Station around 800 metres north of the Campbell Road civil and tunnel site. However, workers starting or ending shifts very early or very late would be more likely to use private vehicles.\n\nA car parking strategy would be developed as part of the Construction Traffic and Access Management Plan (CTAMP) to limit impacts on parking for the surrounding communities. The strategy would be developed in consultation with local councils and stakeholders associated with public facilities adjacent to project sites, as well as with the M4 East and New M5 contractors (where relevant) to identify opportunities to access parking during their respective construction periods and once those periods are completed.\n\nThe car parking strategy would include items such as forecasting of construction parking demand, review of existing parking supply and use on local streets in the area, impact on existing parking, consultation activities and proposed mitigation measures, such as management of workforce parking and transport, alternative parking arrangements and communication and engagement. This would include the identification of areas where there are high levels of existing parking demand around the construction ancillary facilities and works sites and identifying alternative car parking sites for use by the construction workforce. Processes for monitoring, reporting and corrective actions would also be part of the strategy.\n\nTable 8-42 Indicative daily and peak period construction traffic volumes\n\nNotes:\n\n1: Spoil haulage would occur 24 hours per day, seven days per week\n\n2: Indicative daily, AM and PM peak hour construction traffic volumes for a cumulative impact scenario where a section of the Rozelle civil and tunnel site (C5) is handed over for use for construction of the proposed future Western Harbour Tunnel and Beaches Link project are included in Table 8-42. These indicative construction traffic volumes have been used to carry out the cumulative construction traffic impact assessment in Chapter 26 (Cumulative impacts)\n\nAccess routes\n\nThe proposed access routes to the construction ancillary facilities are summarised in Table 8-43 and shown in Chapter 6 (Construction work). Wherever possible, access is proposed to be gained directly from major arterial roads. The project is also investigating the use of a marshalling area for spoil trucks to further assist in staggering the arrival of vehicles to site. This would be located in a non- residential area and in close proximity to the arterial road network and construction ancillary facilities where tunnelling would occur. This measure would assist in preventing queuing and parking of heavy vehicles on local roads in the vicinity of the project.\n\nThe distribution of light vehicles across the road network would be more varied. For the purposes of this assessment, light vehicle trips have been considered on top of background traffic and distributed accordingly. For all sites, except for the Campbell Road civil and tunnel site (C10), the distribution of access is assumed to be via the M4 Motorway, Victoria Road, Anzac Bridge and Parramatta Road, with the proportion via each varying for each site. For the Campbell Road civil and tunnel site (C10), access for light vehicles is assumed to be divided equally between access from the Princes Highway from the north and the south.\n\nTable 8-43 Indicative access routes to and from construction ancillary facilities\n\nSite Access and egress points Heavy vehicles1 Light vehicles Wattle Street civil and tunnel site (C1a)\n\nParramatta Road then Wattle Street via M4-M5 Link entry and exit ramps\n\nParramatta Road then Wattle Street northern (eastbound) carriageway (right in, right out)\n\nHaberfield civil and tunnel site (C2a)\n\nBelow ground: via the WestConnex M4 East tunnels\n\nAbove ground: Wattle Street (left-in, left-out)\n\nWattle Street southern westbound) carriageway (left-in, left-out)\n\nWalker Avenue\n\nParramatta Road\n\nNorthcote Street civil site (C3a)\n\nParramatta Road (left-in, left- out)\n\nWolseley Street\n\nWattle Street (left-out)\n\nParramatta Road West civil and tunnel site (C1b)\n\nParramatta Road (left-in, left- out)\n\nAlt Street (crossover between sites only)\n\nParramatta Road (left-in, left-out)\n\nAlt Street\n\nHaberfield civil site (C2b)\n\nWattle Street (left-in, left-out)\n\nParramatta Road (left-in, left- out)\n\nWattle Street (left-in, left-out)\n\nParramatta Road (left-in, left-out)\n\nWalker Avenue (left-in, left-out)\n\nParramatta Road East civil site (C3b)\n\nParramatta Road (left-in, left- out)\n\nParramatta Road (left-in, left-out)\n\nAlt Street\n\nBland Street\n\nDarley Road civil and tunnel site (C4)\n\nCity West Link then Darley Road2\n\nCity West Link then Darley Road\n\nRozelle civil and tunnel site (C5)\n\nCity West Link (left-in from eastbound carriageway, right- out to westbound carriageway)\n\nLilyfield Road\n\nThe Crescent civil site (C6)\n\nThe Crescent (left-in, right-out)\n\nThe Crescent\n\nVictoria Road civil site (C7)\n\nVictoria Road (left-in, left-out)\n\nVictoria Road (left in, left out)\n\nHornsey Street\n\nSite Access and egress points Heavy vehicles1 Light vehicles Iron Cove Link civil site (C8)\n\nVictoria Road (left-in, left-out)\n\nVictoria Road (left-in, left-out)\n\nPyrmont Bridge\n\nRoad tunnel site (C9)\n\nParramatta Road (left-in)\n\nPyrmont Bridge Road (left-out)\n\nPyrmont Bridge Road\n\nCampbell Road civil\n\nand tunnel site (C10)\n\nAlbert Street via Campbell\n\nRoad and Princes Highway\n\nAlbert Street via Campbell Road\n\nNotes:\n\nSome use of local roads by heavy vehicles delivering materials and/or equipment may also be required, however this would be minimised as far as practicable.\n\nSpoil haulage vehicles would enter and exit the Darley Road civil and tunnel site (C4) via City West Link.\n\nConstruction ancillary facilities\n\nTwelve construction ancillary facilities are described and assessed in this EIS (see Table 8-44). The construction ancillary facilities would be used for a combination of civil surface works, tunnelling and tunnelling support, construction workforce parking and administrative purposes.\n\nThe number, location and layout of construction ancillary facilities would be finalised as part of detailed construction planning during detailed design and would meet the environmental performance outcomes stated in the EIS and the Submissions and Preferred Infrastructure Report and satisfy criteria identified in any relevant conditions of approval.\n\nTo assist in informing the development of a construction methodology that would manage constructability constraints and the need for construction to occur in a safe and efficient manner, while minimising impacts on local communities, the environment, and users of the surrounding road and other transport networks, two possible combinations of construction ancillary facilities at Haberfield and Ashfield have been assessed in this EIS. The construction ancillary facilities that comprise these options have been grouped together in this EIS and are denoted by the suffix a (for Option A) or b (for Option B) eg C1a Wattle Street civil and tunnel site. Although both of these options have been assessed in this EIS, only one of these options would be used during construction.\n\nTable 8-44 Proposed construction ancillary facilities\n\nSurface construction, including road works, and the establishment of construction ancillary facilities may result in traffic related impacts, including:\n\nAlterations to:\n\nExisting property access\n\nExisting pedestrian and cyclist access and movements\n\nLocation of existing bus stops\n\nLocal traffic environment\n\nTemporary road closures\n\nTemporary impacts on bus stop locations\n\nTemporary changes to pedestrian and cyclist access and movements.\n\nWhere applicable, these impacts have been assessed for each of the areas where surface construction, including road works, would occur. Construction ancillary facility locations are shown in Figure 8-8.\n\n8.3 Assessment of potential impacts\n\n8.3.1 Construction\n\nRozelle civil and tunnel site (C5)\n\nLocation and construction activities\n\nThe Rozelle civil and tunnel site (C5) would be located within the Rozelle Rail Yards between Lilyfield Road to the north, City West Link to the south, Victoria Road to the east and the CBD and South East Light Rail Rozelle maintenance depot to the west.\n\nRoadheaders would be launched from this site to excavate the Rozelle interchange, the Iron Cove Link and the stub tunnels that would enable connections to the proposed future Western Harbour Tunnel and Beaches Link project. Acoustic sheds would be built to minimise noise from out-of-hours tunnelling and spoil handling.\n\nTunnelling and spoil management would also be carried out within the cut-and-cover sections of the tunnels at the eastern end of the site. Tunnel spoil would be transported to a stockpile within the cut- and-cover structures, with sufficient space for about two heavy vehicles to be loaded with spoil.\n\nSpoil handling on the site would occur 24 hours a day, seven days a week. The construction activities at this location are expected to occur between 2018 and 2023.\n\nEntry and exit\n\nHeavy vehicle access would be via City West Link. Vehicles would enter the site from the eastbound carriageway of City West Link via slip lanes and new driveways. A new temporary signalised intersection would be built along City West Link and a new northern leg added to the intersection with The Crescent to enable vehicles to exit the site and turn right at both these locations, to head\n\nVictoria Road civil site (C7)\n\nLocation and construction activities\n\nThe Victoria Road civil site (C7) would be located on the western side of Victoria Road between Quirk Street and Lilyfield Road on land currently occupied by commercial and residential properties. The existing buildings and other structures on the site would be demolished to facilitate establishment of temporary site offices, a laydown area, workforce amenities and car parking. A portion of this site would be occupied by operational road infrastructure during operation. The construction activities at this location are expected to occur between 2019 and 2022.\n\nEntry and exit\n\nHeavy vehicles would enter and exit the site via left-in/left-out access points off the westbound Victoria Road carriageway.\n\nLocal road impacts\n\nMinor impacts from construction vehicles are expected to the eastern end of Hornsey Street. On street parking along the eastbound carriageway would be removed (about four spaces) during construction, although this would be lessened by the removal of the traffic to and from the commercial properties that would be replaced by the Victoria Road civil site.\n\nIron Cove Link civil site (C8)\n\nLocation and construction activities\n\nThe Iron Cove Link civil site (C8) would be located along the southern side of Victoria Road at Rozelle between Byrnes Street and Springside Street. The site would be located on land currently occupied by Victoria Road and residential and commercial properties that are being acquired.\n\nThe site would be mainly used to support construction of the Iron Cove Link surface works, including tunnel entry and exit ramps and upgrades and modifications to the eastbound and westbound carriageways of Victoria Road. There is no provision at this site to operate roadheaders, however the site may be used to support limited excavation of the initial sections of the Iron Cove Link tunnels.\n\nDuring operation, a portion of the site would be occupied by the Iron Cove Link motorway operations complex (MOC4) including the Iron Cove Link ventilation facility. The construction activities at this location are expected to occur between 2018 and 2023.\n\nEntry and exit\n\nHeavy and light vehicles would enter and exit the site via left-in/left-out accesses off the northbound Victoria Road carriageway.\n\nLocal road impacts\n\nTemporary changes to the local road network would be required to enable construction of the permanent design and the operation of the Iron Cove Link civil and tunnel site during construction. The Clubb Street/Victoria Road intersection would also be permanently closed before the start of construction.\n\nThe Toelle Street and Callan Street intersections with Victoria Road would generally remain open during construction. There would be instances where one of these intersections would be closed temporarily to construct the permanent design, however these works would be short term and conducted during non-peak times, where practical, especially as these roads would be carrying additional traffic form the closure of Clubb Street. Regard would also be given to the peak periods of use of King George Park when considering temporary closures. When construction is complete, these intersections would be reopened in the same arrangement as existing (ie left-in, left-out).\n\nThere would be loss of limited on-street parking spaces on Clubb Street, Toelle Street and Callan Street, west of Victoria Road. This would be confirmed following the appointment of a design and construction contractor. These parking spaces are adjacent to properties being acquired and so the impact of their loss would be reduced.\n\nFurther detail on the temporary and permanent changes to the surface road network around the Iron Cove Link civil site are provided in Chapter 5 (Project description) and Chapter 6 (Construction work).\n\nIntersection level of service\n\nThe intersection performance results for the road network under the 2021 ‘without construction’ and ‘with construction’ forecast traffic volumes for the AM and PM peak are summarised in Table 8-47 and Table 8-48. These intersection levels of service are not directly comparable to those presented in the operational modelling results, as those had exit blocking constraints, applied in the microsimulation models to reflect network congestion beyond the modelled network extents, removed.\n\nThe intersections assessed were grouped into six corridors (or clusters). A summary of the construction traffic impacts within each of these clusters is provided in the following sections. Detailed discussion on the potential impacts within each cluster is provided in Appendix H (Technical working paper: Traffic and transport).\n\nCluster 3: City West Link and The Crescent at Lilyfield\n\nCluster 3 consists of the following intersections:\n\nCity West Link/The Crescent\n\nThe Crescent/James Craig Road\n\nCity West Link/Rozelle civil and tunnel site (C5) western access.\n\nThe construction modelling indicates that in the ‘without construction’ scenario, City West Link/The Crescent and The Crescent/James Craig Road intersections are forecast to operate satisfactorily at LoS D or better in both peaks. With about 135 PCU and 325 PCU added to the network in the AM and PM peaks respectively in the ‘with construction’ scenario, the operational performance at the intersections is forecast to worsen.\n\nIn the ‘with construction’ scenario, the new eastern access road to the Rozelle civil and tunnel site (C5) is accommodated as the northern approach to City West Link/The Crescent intersection. Construction vehicles are only permitted to turn right out of this access road onto City West Link westbound. However, safe operation requires a new traffic signal phase. It is expected that this phase would only be required to run once every three cycles. In the AM peak, City West Link/The Crescent intersection level of service is forecast to drop from LoS D to LoS E with an increase in average delay of about 15 seconds. In the PM peak, the level of service is forecast to remain at LoS C.\n\nA new temporary signalised intersection is also proposed on City West Link about 400 metres west of The Crescent, accommodating a second (western) site access to the Rozelle civil and tunnel site (C5). Construction vehicles are similarly only permitted to turn right out of this access road, with a traffic signal phase required to safely accommodate this movement. This intersection is forecast to operate at LoS A in both AM and PM peak hours.\n\nThere is no adverse impact expected on The Crescent/James Craig Road intersection, with LoS B forecast in both ‘without construction’ and ‘with construction’ scenarios in both peaks.\n\nSummary\n\nThe construction impact assessment found that the most substantial impacts are forecast to be at the western end of the project footprint, as spoil trucks travel to the potential spoil management sites to the west of the project from the construction ancillary facilities and back. Light construction vehicle traffic would also contribute to these impacts, although these would use more dispersed routes.\n\nMitigation measures to manage these impacts would be developed as part of the CTAMP, and could include:\n\nRestriction of heavy vehicle right turns at City West Link/James Street and City West Link/The Crescent intersections during peak hours\n\nStaggering or rescheduling shift times to avoid a large generation of light vehicles during peak hours.\n\nThe assessment of potential construction traffic and transport impacts is a worst-case assessment based on peak construction traffic levels. Adverse impacts would be expected to reduce once peak construction is complete. A CTAMP will be prepared as part of the CEMP. The CTAMP will include the guidelines, general requirements and principles of traffic management to be implemented during construction and will seek to minimise delays and disruptions and identify and respond to any changes in road safety as a result of highway construction works. Further details on the management of construction impacts are provided in section 8.5.\n\nTable 8-47 Option A – 2021 AM peak hour intersection operational performance summary\n\nNotes: 1Traffic volume rounded to nearest 10\n\nTable 8-48 Option A – 2021 PM peak hour intersection operational performance summary\n\nNotes: 1Traffic volume rounded to nearest 10\n\nTemporary road network changes, closures and diversions\n\nIt is anticipated that road network modifications would be required to facilitate construction of the project. Indicative modifications are outlined in Table 8-49.\n\nRoad network modifications and traffic staging would be reviewed during the preparation of CTAMP, with the objective of minimising disruptions to the road network. At all locations where road closures would be required, access to properties would be maintained during construction. Appropriate signage for road closures or detours would be installed.\n\nTable 8-49 Indicative temporary road network modifications during construction – Option A\n\nRoad reinstatement: When construction is complete, the road would be reinstated as per the permanent design shown in Chapter 5 (Project description)\n\nGordon Street south of Lilyfield Road at Rozelle\n\nIndicative duration: Q42018toQ2 2019 to complete road modifications. Q42018toQ3 2023 including construction duration staging and reinstatement of roads\n\nRoad reinstatement: Once works during the stage are completed, the road would be reopened in line with permanent design\n\nThe construction of major infrastructure in constrained urban environments requires detailed consideration of the staging of construction works. There are three key areas of the project which will require the preparation of detailed traffic staging plans during construction:\n\nVictoria Road/City West Link/Anzac Bridge approach intersection – reconstructing the intersection to accommodate existing connectivity, the new M4 East Motorway/Iron Cove Link to Anzac Bridge connections and construction of a new bridge at Victoria Road\n\nCity West Link/The Crescent intersection – realigning The Crescent to the west, building a new bridge over Whites Creek and modifying the intersection\n\nVictoria Road at Iron Cove – realigning the westbound (southern) carriageway of Victoria Road to create sufficient space to build new tunnel portals and entry and exit ramps for the Iron Cove Link.\n\nThese works would be undertaken on parts of the arterial road network that are heavily trafficked and which provide important network connectivity. To construct these works would require the implementation of multiple traffic stages that meet the requirements of the construction contractor, Roads and Maritime, Transport Management Centre (TMC) and other key stakeholders. The traffic staging would likely require the creation of temporary carriageways, intersections and bridges offline from the existing road infrastructure to enable the construction of the new works and the switching of traffic.\n\nTemporary closures and diversions, outside of peak hours would be required and would be undertaken following consultation with the TMC. Staging arrangements would be confirmed by the construction contractor during detailed design.\n\nIn preparing the traffic staging plans during construction the key considerations would include:\n\nMaintaining a safe environment for the public and the construction workforce\n\nMaintaining traffic and lane capacity, including bus or transit lane capacity, on the arterial road network particularly during peak periods\n\nMinimising delays to motorists utilising the affected parts of the arterial road network\n\nUndertaking the works efficiently to minimise the duration of traffic impacts\n\nMaintaining the safety of motorists, members of the public and construction personnel\n\nMinimising impacts on public transport services and providing alternative arrangements where necessary\n\nMinimising impacts on key active transport links and providing alternative arrangements where necessary.\n\nTraffic crashes\n\nConstruction traffic volumes are expected to be low when compared to existing traffic volumes on key arterial roads connecting to the construction ancillary facility locations. The greatest increase is forecast to occur on City West Link west of the City West Link/James Street intersection where, as a worst-case scenario, construction would generate around 110 vehicles during the AM peak hour and around 220 vehicles in the PM peak hour. Compared to existing traffic volumes, total construction traffic would be the equivalent of around three per cent of peak hour traffic on City West Link at this location during the AM peak hour and five per cent of existing peak hour volumes in the PM peak hour.\n\nThe volume of traffic generated by construction is expected to be low compared to existing traffic. The effects of this short-term increase on the existing road network is not expected to substantially impact road safety in and around the study area, although there is still a risk with construction traffic interacting with general traffic, with elevated risk when construction-related vehicles are entering and leaving construction sites.\n\nForeseen impacts on road safety for all users during construction would be mitigated as much as possible through the provision of a CTAMP and would include the development of construction staging and temporary works that minimises conflicts with the existing road network and maximises spatial separation between work areas and travel lanes. Further management measures that would be incorporated in the CTAMP are detailed in section 8.5.3.\n\nPublic transport services\n\nAn increase in vehicles on the road network during the construction period is forecast to result in some increased delays at certain intersections. Heavy vehicle volumes would increase along major roads. The following impacts on public transport services in these areas would potentially be experienced:\n\nBuses:\n\nSimilar to general traffic, there would be an increase in bus travel times due to slower travel speeds and increased intersection delays. This would be partially mitigated by the presence of bus lanes along Victoria Road and Parramatta Road to be installed as part of the M4 East project (refer to condition of approval B34 for the M4 East project for details on the provision of bus lanes along Parramatta Road)\n\nLonger travel times to and from bus stops by supplementary travel modes (eg car passenger, walking to/from bus stops) due to an increase in traffic volumes, slower travel speeds and increased intersection delays\n\nReduced amenity for bus users waiting at stops.\n\nThe traffic assessment has identified bus stops that would require relocation during construction for safety reasons, comprising\n\nThe bus stops on The Crescent (northbound and southbound) at Annandale near the intersection with City West Link would be moved south towards Johnston Street to allow for construction along The Crescent. The northbound bus stop would be permanently moved south to accommodate the new alignment. The southbound bus stop would be reinstated in generally the same location. Alternative access from The Crescent to the Rozelle Bay light rail stop would also be provided during construction\n\nThree bus stops on Victoria Road (two on the northbound side and one on the southbound side) near the intersection with The Crescent would be relocated north to accommodate the reconstruction of Victoria Road. These bus stops would be reinstated in generally the same location at the completion of construction\n\nTwo bus stops on Victoria Road near Iron Cove Bridge would be temporarily relocated (further east of the bridge) to allow for the widening works along Victoria Road. These bus stops would be reinstated in generally the same location at the completion of construction.\n\nThe modifications to bus stops would be reviewed during detailed design with the objective of minimising disruptions to public transport services. Bus stop relocations would be agreed with Transport for NSW and all affected bus operators.\n\nRail services\n\nBus service connections to railway stations may be affected due to a reduction in the reliability of bus services during the construction period. The project would have no direct impact on heavy rail services.\n\nLight rail\n\nBus service connections to light rail stops may be affected due to a reduction in the reliability of bus services during the construction period. Pedestrian access to the Leichhardt North light rail stop adjacent to the Darley Road civil and tunnel site (C4) and the Rozelle Bay light rail stop next to The Crescent, would be maintained during construction. The project would not directly impact on operation of light rail services.\n\nWalking and cycling\n\nThe construction impacts on pedestrians and cyclists have been assessed using the criteria outlined in Table 8-50. An increase in the number of vehicles during the construction period would potentially impact walking and cycling amenity. Pedestrian footways and cycle paths would also need to be diverted during construction.\n\nTable 8-50 Active transport – impact severity criteria\n\nSeverity Impact criteria Negligible\n\nThe impacts result in an imperceptible change (ie a very minor increase in traffic volumes) and do not require any mitigation\n\nMinor\n\nDiversion of less than 200 metres on key routes and no new at-grade crossing\n\nNegligible safety impact\n\nModerate\n\nDiversion of more than 200 metres but less than 500 metres on key routes\n\nNegligible safety impact\n\nHigh\n\nDiversion of more than 500 metres on key routes\n\nPotential safety impact\n\nConstruction activities would be carried out in stages resulting in changing impacts over the course of the construction program. Further information on the staged construction of the project is provided in Chapter 6 (Construction work). A key objective of the construction program would be to minimise disruption to pedestrians and cyclists and enable the use of the active transport links that would be provided as part of the project as soon as possible. Details about the active transport infrastructure that would be provided by the project are included in Appendix N (Technical working paper: Active transport strategy).\n\nLocal road impacts\n\nThe main local road impacts would be on Lilyfield Road. While 350 daily light vehicle trips are expected to access the site, the impact would be spread out through the use of five access and egress points along Lilyfield Road, depending on where the vehicles are required and where they are coming from. As a worst case, this would equate to an increase in two-way weekday daily vehicles of around 10 to 15 per cent depending on the location on Lilyfield Road.\n\nRozelle interchange construction ancillary facilities (C5, C6 and C7)\n\nConstruction at these sites is planned to occur between 2018 and 2023. Key regional active transport routes pass through the Rozelle interchange area.\n\nAnticipated temporary pedestrian and cyclist diversions around the Rozelle interchange during construction are shown in Table 8-9. The permanent pedestrian and cyclist infrastructure that would be provided around the Rozelle interchange is described in Chapter 5 (Project description) and Appendix N (Technical working paper: Active transport strategy).\n\nLilyfield Road to Anzac Bridge (east–west)\n\nThis route provides an east-west active transport link for pedestrians and cyclists between Lilyfield Road and Anzac Bridge including a crossing over Victoria Road at Rozelle via the existing Victoria Road pedestrian bridge. This bridge has limited width relative to demand and steep gradients with sharp 180 degree bends. It is therefore of low quality relative to its use and importance.\n\nThe Victoria Road pedestrian bridge would be demolished and removed at the start of construction. Prior to this occurring, an alternative connection to the western side of Victoria Road and the Lilyfield Road commuter route would be established via an underpass below Victoria Road into the Rozelle Rail Yards, and a ramp connection to Victoria Road and Lilyfield Road. This underpass would enable east-west trips to continue and it is anticipated that it will be converted into a portion of the permanent connection at the completion of construction. Although this would mean a permanent change to the alignment of this route, the impact of this alignment change would be negligible as the distance of the route would be similar and the quality of the connection would be equivalent to the existing route.\n\nTemporary realignment of the section of this connection between Anzac Bridge and the western side of Victoria Road may also be required. Connections to the shared path on either side of Victoria Road would be retained. Temporary closures of the shared path along Victoria Road may be periodically required. Works would be staged so that the shared path on either the eastern or western side of Victoria Road at Rozelle would remain open at all times.\n\nJohnston Street to Victoria Road and Anzac Bridge\n\nThe pedestrian and cycle bridge that spans City West Link and connects Anzac Bridge and Victoria Road with The Crescent and Johnston Street would be removed at the start of construction. Potential alternatives and diversions being considered for implementation include:\n\nThe existing at-grade crossing between The Crescent and the western side of Victoria Road. This route would also allow for onward connection to the eastern side of Victoria Road and Anzac Bridge via the new pedestrian and cyclist underpass that would be provided below Victoria Road (see description of this underpass above). The diversion would be less than 200 metres and there would be negligible safety impact. However, there could be a minor increase in travel times due to delays waiting for the traffic signals to change. The impact of this change would therefore be Minor\n\nFrom Anzac Bridge to Somerville Road at Rozelle via the existing pedestrian and cycle ramp, then south west along Somerville Road and James Craig Road (using the shared path) towards the footpath on the southern side of The Crescent. This would result in a similar travel distance to the current route and would be a negligible impact.\n\nPeriodic, short-term closures of the footpath on one side of James Craig Road at Rozelle may be required during construction. During these instances, the footpath on the other side of James Craig Road would be used as an alternative route. Periodic, temporary closures of the footpath on the eastern and western side of The Crescent at Annandale between City West Link and Johnston Street at Annandale would also be required during construction. Works would be staged so that the shared path on one side of The Crescent would remain open at all times.\n\nThe project would also require permanent closure of the shared path through Buruwan Park connecting The Crescent with Bayview Crescent at Annandale (see Table 8-9). Alternative access for pedestrians to the Rozelle Bay light rail stop from The Crescent, Johnston Street and Bayview Crescent at Annandale would be provided at all times during construction. Cyclists travelling between The Crescent and Bayview Crescent/Railway Parade at Annandale would be diverted via Johnston Street.\n\nIron Cove Link civil site (C8)\n\nKey temporary pedestrian and cyclist diversions around the Iron Cove Link civil site (C8) during construction are shown in Figure 8-10. The permanent pedestrian and cyclist infrastructure that would be provided around the Iron Cove Link tunnel portals is shown in Chapter 5 (Project description) and Appendix N (Technical working paper: Active transport strategy).\n\nConstruction at this site is planned between 2018 and 2023. The key pedestrian and cycle route in this area connects Iron Cove Bridge shared path (on the southern side of Victoria Road), the shared paths on either side of Victoria Road and the Bay Run south of Victoria Road, which extends around Iron Cove.\n\nA detour route would be provided for cyclists on the southern side of Victoria Road via Springside Street, McCleer Street, Callan Street, Manning Street and Byrnes Street. This would represent a travel distance of about 700 metres, 400 metres longer than the existing 300 metre section along Victoria Road. Given the length of the diversion and the corresponding increase in travel times for pedestrians and cyclists, the impact would be classed as Moderate.\n\nA temporary link would be provided that would connect the Bay Run and Iron Cove Bridge. To minimise potential disruption to pedestrians and cyclists that use this link, a temporary ramp to Iron Cove Bridge shared path would be provided, to connect the Bay Run and Iron Cove Bridge (westbound) and Byrnes Street (eastbound, to connect with the diversion described above). This temporary diversion would not change the distance or travel times for users of the Bay Run and Iron Cove Bridge and would not result in additional safety impacts, and would therefore have a negligible impact.\n\nConstruction impact assessment – Option B"
