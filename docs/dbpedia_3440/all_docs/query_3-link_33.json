        "text": "Construction has finished on a promised new lane space near the Rozelle Interchange in a scramble to ease choke points at Sydney's City West Link.\n\nThe second lane was added near the Crescent Overpass ahead of peak morning traffic on Thursday, after the emergency short-term solution was announced over the weekend.\n\nIt's meant to provide overdue relief for the first time since the interchange opened at the end of November.\n\nThe doubling of lane space is designed to help motorists travelling onto the Anzac Bridge, where city-bound cars previously had to merge into a single lane.\n\nCoordinator general at Transport for NSW Howard Collins said the change will slice a one-hour-20-minute congestion point down to less than 20 minutes.\n\n\"This has improved the flow rate of what was a lot of frustration for the City West Link,\" he told ABC Radio Sydney.\n\n\"We've [also] got further ideas we're working on 24/7 to see if we can improve the flow on Victoria Road.\"\n\nWinners and losers\n\nTransport for NSW said it has noted traffic flow improvements on the City West Link in the last seven days.\n\nThey reported a city bound trip from Haberfield to the Anzac Bridge now takes 30 minutes, compared to just under 45 a week ago.\n\nMr Collins acknowledged the traffic build-up was particularly affecting residents near Balmain and surrounds, nearest to the Rozelle Interchange itself.\n\n\"I recognise it and I know it's a big problem, we are trying our best to fix it,\" he said.\n\nHowever, he said alternative route Parramatta Road — voted the worst road in Sydney for congestion this year — has seen the \"lightest traffic it has had for 25 to 30 years\".\n\nThe coordinator general said cars coming from Gladesville in the city's north should be taking advantage of the toll-free tunnel off the Iron Cove Bridge.\n\n\"You're clogging up what local residents need is space — please use the tunnel, it's free and you'll find a quicker journey,\" he said.\n\nScrapped moveable lanes plan revealed\n\nYesterday, it was revealed the previous government secretly looked at creating movable lanes on the bridge and adding two extra city bound lanes to a stretch of the Western Distributor.\n\nBut it quietly shelved those plans before the last election.\n\nRoads Minister John Graham said the tidal flow system on the bridge takes up to three years to introduce and the previous government did not work to deliver it in time for the opening of the interchange.\n\nFormer Coalition roads minister Natalie Ward said the government had been in office for nine months and had plenty of time to prepare for the opening of the complicated network of roads.\n\nMr Collins said the expensive proposal for the contraflow might also be unsafe.\n\n\"If we let traffic free flow through this particular junction, what will happen is the city will gridlock further down,\" he said.\n\n\"As we have seen several head-on crashes on the Sydney Harbour Bridge and the airport tunnel, this has been an issue we worry about when we're pushing traffic in opposite directions without any protection.\""
