        "text": "Plans for a harbour crossing were first mooted in 1815 by architect Francis Greenway, however due to the size of the project nothing came of this. Serious plans resurfaced in the 1890's when a royal comission found there was a large amount of congestion caused by ferry traffic, and recommended the construction of a bridge as the best solution.\n\nDesigns and proposals were requested in 1900, with architects from all round the world vying for the lucrative design contract. The final proposal was accepted from Dr John Bradfield in 1911, who completed formal designs in 1916. The only constraints placed on Bradfield's design were that the bridge must include a railway and allow for shipping to pass either beneath it or through an opening span.\n\nDue to World War 1, construction was postponed until 1922 when, in November of that year, the NSW Government passed laws allowing the construction of the bridge. Bradfield gave the government assurance that only Australians would comprise the workforce.\n\nThe 'turning of the first sod' was performed by the Hon. R.T Ball, M.L.A at North Sydney on 28th July 1923. The tender of Dorman, Long & Co. Ltd. of Middlesbrough, England was accepted on 24th March 1924, at a contract price of Â£4,217,721. Major pre-construction work including the tramway diversion from Alfred St, along Dind St to Glen St, and the complete transfer of traffic from the old Milsons Point Station (where Luna Park is now) to the new station (above Fitzroy St) involving railway and ferry changeover, and street widening was completed in July 1924. The ferry docks in Alfred St were moved to Jeffrey St to allow unimpeded access for construction vehicles and machinery to the work site (where Luna Park is now). The excavations for the main bearings and approach span piers were commenced in January 1925.\n\nThe Bridge itself:\n\nThe bridge itself was constructed arch-first, with the arches being constructed from either abutment almost simultaneously, work from the southern abutment being one month ahead of work from the northern abutment. This was done so any errors could be detected and fixed, while ensuring they did not also happen on the northern section. The arch was commenced in October 1928 and the two sections were joined in an excruciating 12-hour process in August 1930, following a 4-day round-the-clock cable-slackening operation. The joining of the arch was complicated by rapidly falling temperatures and therefore rapidly contracting steel. The deck construction was begun immediately after the arch was closed and was completed in April 1931. Following this, the concrete roadway and the tram/railway tracks were laid. During February 1932 the bridge deck was strenuously load tested with all 4 rail tracks fully loaded with 72 steam locomotives. After 3 weeks of testing, the bridge was deemed to have passed with flying colours, comforming with every one of the designers' and builders' expectations.\n\nNorthern Approach:\n\nThe northern approach, 800m long, is entirely elevated roadway. It was a remarkable piece of bridge construction at the time, being built on a curve and a superelevation. The tram lines, in the vicinity of the transition into Pacific Hwy, rose over the six traffic lanes on a long curved viaduct to parallel the semi-underground North Shore rail line and join Blue St in front of North Sydney Station. The construction of the northern approach was well-advanced before the arch was commenced, with Milsons Point Station opening in July 1924. The railway line between Hornsby and Milsons Point was electrified to compliment the project in 1928. The Pacific Hwy, known prior to 1928 as Junction St and from 1928 to 1931 as Great Northern Highway, was also extended 1,050 feet (~330m) diagonally through the block east of Walker St and the length from Hornsby to Milsons Point was reconstructed in cement concrete.\n\nSouthern Approach:\n\nLike the northern approach, the southern approach, 900m long (including the toll plaza), was constructed in advance of the bridge, providing access for construction vehicles to the base of the arches. The southern approach is almost entirely elevated roadway, built 10m above The Rocks to Observatory Hill where the toll plazas were constructed, along with possibly Australia's first roundabout providing access to York, Grosvenor, Clarence and Kent Streets. The railway approach disappeared underground upon reching Observatory Hill and joined the newly built City Circle railway to Central Station. The two stations associated with the bridge construction, Town Hall and Wynyard, opened in February 1928.\n\nIn the mid-1950's the Minister for Transport announced that by 1961 all tram services would be eliminated and replaced by buses. An important result of this decision was the provision of two more vehicular lanes on the the Sydney Harbour Bridge. The design of the bridge had originally provided for two railway tracks on each side of the roadway, however, as the proposed railway to the Mosman-Manly-Narrabeen area had been abandoned, the double track on the eastern side of the deck was used to carry trams (which already served those areas) into Wynyard Station. When the abandonement of the trams was announced, the Department of Railways decided that the future needs of rail capacity on the Sydney Harbour Bridge could be met by the 2 western tracks, and therefore made the 2 eastern tracks available to the Department of Main Roads for road use. The track area was sufficient to provide 2 new traffic lanes although the the width was less than the normal standard.\n\nAt the northern end of the bridge, the tramway viaduct from Blue St was used as vehicle access to the new lanes and a toll booth was constructed in the vicinity of Fitzroy St. At the southern end of the bridge, a ramp was constructed to carry the two new lanes over the entrance to the tramway tunnels leading to Wynyard Station. Tram services were ceased across the bridge and the tracks handed over to the Department of Main Roads in June 1958. The additional traffic lanes were opened to traffic in July 1959.\n\nThroughout the 1980's, ever increasing traffic volumes and subsequent extensions of the freeway approaches caused more and more congestion on the 8-lane bridge. Plans for a second harbour crossing of any form were mooted, with construction of a tunnel between the Warringah Freeway at North Sydney and the Cahill Expressway at Conservatorium Rd selected as the preferred option. The DMR's leadership team of Bernard Fisk and his three directors accepted a private sector proposal for a second harbour crossing which, instead of being a response to a government tender, was initiated by the private sector. Designed by the Transfield-Kumagai joint venture, supervised by the DMR and financed by Westpac, the Sydney Harbour Tunnel Project was ratified on 31 May 1987. A second harbour crossing was part of the Roads 2000 plan Sydney Orbital plan, but with its cost far outweighing the budget for a single year, the private sector provided the best means of funding the project. The Greiner government of 1988 actually opposed the tunnel but continued the project after an review of the legal position indicated that it would cost just as much to cancel as it would to continue. Promising to reduce the state's debt, Greiner paid the $8.3 million still owed on the Sydney Harbour Bridge Account - including the loans used to finance the Cahill & Warringah Expressways - but retained the bridge toll to contribute to the cost of the tunnel, which would also attract a toll. The bridge toll subsequently rose from 20c to $1 in June 1987. Construction began in May of that year with reconstruction of the freeways surrounding both portals.\n\nThe northern portals were constructed in the Warringah Freeway between High St and Mount St. The eastern-most reversible roadway was closed south of Ridge St as that would become the toll plaza and northern approach to the tunnel. The northbound portal was located in the middle of the western-most carriageway which was widened to accommodate the extra lanes. At the southern portals, constructed beneath the Cahill Expressway 50m north of Conservatorium Rd, firstly a bridge was constructed to carry the eastbound lanes of the Cahill Expressway above the the portal construction. The Cahill Expressway was narrowed to one-lane in each direction between Conservatorium Rd and the Circular Quay viaduct following the completion of construction. The southern portals also lie directly above two rail tunnels that carry the City Circle rail line between Circular Quay and St James stations. Complex construction techniques were needed to avoid damaging the rail tunnels; concrete beams supported by 7m piers were installed to create an underground bridge on which the road tunnel now rests.\n\nThe tunnel itself is made up of three sections; twin 900m land tunnels on the north shore, twin 400m land tunnels on the south shore and a 960m immersed tube (IMT) structure beneath the harbour. The most challenging part of construction was the joining of the submerged tunnel with twin land tunnels beneath the newly-refurbished Opera House concourse. Engineers had to excavate without disturbing the councourse and had to underpin the half-metre thick concourse slab with massive piers and beams to enable old piers that were in the way of the tunnel to be removed. The submerged IMT structure consists of eight 120m long pre-fabricated concrete sections sealed with a waterproof membrane, constructed in a dry dock at Port Kembla and then towed to Sydney Harbour. A 12m deep trench was dredged prior to the arrival of the IMT's and then the IMT's were lowered into the tranch by a system of pontoons and control towers. After the IMT's were in place the trenches were backfilled and then rock armour was placed over the top to protect the units against marine hazards such as anchors or sinking vessels.\n\nOn the north shore, in Bradfield Park, a complex ventilation system was constructed to supply fresh air to, and remove exhaust from , the tunnel through ventilation stacks inside the north bridge pylons. On the north side of Mount St bridge, a tunnel and traffic management centre was constructed deirectly opposite the Mount St on/off ramps. A toll plaza was also constructed in the southbound apporach carriageway.\n\nDuring the tunnel construction, the Sydney Harbour Bridge toll was raised from $1 to $1.50, this happening in March 1989.\n\nAs part of the Sydney Harbour Tunnel construction, the Sydney Harbour Bridge also recieved an upgrade, with lane 7 transformed into a bus lane which continued south into York St and north along the Warringah Freeway to Miller St. The bus lane commenced operation on 31 August 1992.\n\nThe 4-lane Sydney Harbour Tunnel was opened in September 1992 with a $2 toll. The bridge toll was also raised to match the tunnel toll. The Sydney Harbour Bridge was also stripped of its National Route 1 designation which was routed onto the tunnel."
