        "text": "Vision of the scene captured dozens of police cars blocking both citybound and northbound lanes with long lines of banked up commuters just ahead of the peak hour rush.\n\n\"There are 3 southbound lanes and 2 northbound lanes open on the Harbour Bridge with this ongoing police operation. Traffic is heavy in both directions - expect delays and consider an alternate route,\" Live Traffic Sydney said in an update at 6.40am.\n\nNSW Police confirmed the incident related to self-harm by an individual, but could not provide further details.\n\nAs of 7am, one southbound lane heading into the city remains blocked off, with traffic on the Cahill Expressway merging into a single lane at Milsons Point.\n\nThree lanes are open northbound, but the traffic jam is trailing back all the way to Anzac Bridge, past the Western Distributor and Darling Harbour.\n\nCongestion along the bridge appears to be clearing up gradually, although with a crawling movement of cars.\n\nTrain operations are not reported to have been impacted so far.\n\nCommuters are, however, advised to allow plenty of extra travel time due to severe weather conditions at various locations across Sydney brought on by heavy thunderstorms on Monday.\n\nA local described the scenes from Tuesday morning as complete chaos, urging people to try and avoid heading into work.\n\n\"Nothing's moving and the commute over the bridge could take up to an hour. Work from home if you can,\" they told the Daily Mail.\n\n\"It's been chaos, cars are trying to skip the traffic and cut off others to get into the Harbour Tunnel which is now backed up as well. It hasn't moved now in well over 20 minutes and there's no way of turning around once you're already on the freeway.\n\n\"It's car-mageddon out there - and drivers are getting really frustrated.\""
