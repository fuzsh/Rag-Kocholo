        "text": "Sydneysiders have been drenched by heavy rain for the second time in as many days, but the weather bureau says the worst of the severe thunderstorms have already passed.\n\nThe city’s southern suburbs and much of the Illawarra were subject to a severe thunderstorm warning on Tuesday, with flash flooding occurring in some parts.\n\nRoads began to resemble rivers in Wolli Creek, where a blocked drain caused flooding on Arncliffe Street and the SES had to come to the rescue of drivers trapped in the waters.\n\nThere was a severe thunderstorm warning for areas including Engadine, Lucas Heights and Macquarie Fields, Leppington, Minto and the Royal National Park, but it was cancelled by mid-afternoon.\n\nA general severe weather warning for heavy rain in place for the Sydney metro area, including the city and Parramatta, was also cancelled.\n\nThe peak of the storm risk will be this Friday, as pop princess Taylor Swift takes the stage in Sydney Olympic Park. The Bureau of Meteorology is predicting a downpour, which could contribute to what will already be a strained public transport network.\n\nTuesday’s wet weather comes after a police operation on the Harbour Bridge caused huge delays for Sydney commuters with traffic queues stretching for eight kilometres past the Anzac Bridge and 16 kilometres past the Lane Cove Tunnel. Delays also flowed onto the Eastern Distributor.\n\nBy 9am, all lanes had reopened and the operation was resolved, after a significant police and ambulance response."
