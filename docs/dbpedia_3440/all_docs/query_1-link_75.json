        "text": "Swirling deep beneath Sydney's surface is an intricate web of tunnels considered to be one of the world's most complicated underground interchanges.\n\nIt opened to the public today, putting drivers' nerves to the test as they attempted to navigate the complex Rozelle Interchange.\n\nThe first motorists ventured in from 5am and were slowly escorted through the spaghetti junction by police.\n\nLoading\n\nDespite transport officials claiming it will be as easy as \"just following the signs,\" they are bracing for weeks of traffic disruption and delays.\n\nIt's also anticipated the impact on surrounding local roads, especially around the Anzac Bridge, may take \"up to six months to settle down\", according to NSW Roads Minister John Graham.\n\nDrivers are also being warned not to rely on GPS as it may take some providers weeks to update their maps to include the labyrinth of new tunnels.\n\nHow prepared are you?\n\nLoading...\n\nIn an attempt to coach an anticipated 100,000 commuters daily through the interchange, the state government released more than a dozen computer-simulated trips depicting every possible route, which can be found here, and a test your knowledge quiz here.\n\nThe online quiz gives users three minutes to answer eight questions, including \"what should you do if you miss your exit on the Rozelle Interchange?\".\n\nUnsurprisingly, they will be deducted points if they select the option A: \"stop\" or Option C: \"reverse back to the exit you missed.\"\n\nWestConnex operator, Transurban, also provides an interactive \"plan your journey\" tool here.\n\nCrews will be monitoring over 800 security cameras in the tunnels to respond to any incidents.\n\nHow did we get here?\n\nLoading...\n\nThe Rozelle Interchange connects the M4-M8 Link between St Peters and Haberfield, the Anzac Bridge, City West Link and the Western Distributor.\n\nIt will also link to the future Western Harbour Tunnel, which is expected to open in 2028.\n\nThe motorway maze is the final stage of the WestConnex, and took 20,000 workers over four years to build.\n\nComprised of 16.6 kilometres of road tunnel, commuters will travel 35 metres below the inner-west suburbs of Rozelle, Annandale and Lilyfield.\n\nThe now-complete WestConnex is expected to cut travel times from Parramatta to the CBD by up to 20 minutes and take around 45,000 cars off congested Parramatta Road each day.\n\nDo I have to pay a toll?\n\nUsing the motorway won't come cheap.\n\nNo toll-free period is being offered, and motorists travelling from Church Street in Parramatta to the city will pay the maximum capped amount of $11.11 each way.\n\nCommuters that take a wrong turn and need to double back will be charged the toll again.\n\nToll prices vary for each part of the journey and can be found here.\n\nThe interchange's only free section – a 1.1km tunnel under Victoria Road at Rozelle — will bypass seven sets of traffic lights at the notorious traffic choke point.\n\nMr Graham, who previously campaigned against \"toll-mania\", said relief was on the way for motorists from January 1, when the Minns government will introduce a $60-a-week toll cap.\n\nWill it pollute my suburb?\n\nThe construction of the Rozelle Interchange has been contentious at times, with residents furious when homes were compulsorily acquired for the project, and others complaining of deafening around-the-clock noise as tunnel boring machines drilled beneath their homes.\n\nResidents also raised concerns over the potential health impact of a trio of enormous, 35m ventilation towers, or smoke stacks, at Rozelle built to release exhaust fumes from the tunnel.\n\nMr Graham assured the public the impact on air quality had been reviewed by experts and deemed safe, with an additional review underway following the completion of the interchange."
