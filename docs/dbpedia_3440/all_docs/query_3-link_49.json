        "text": "The Impressive Busway!üöç One of Australia's most advanced bus network is looked after by Brisbane City Council. Where buses are comparable to high frequency trains, running on dedicated bus ways. Large bus interchanges, some of which lie right under the CBD! Being an Melbournian, where the only underground structure is the City Loop, the awe of walking around the underground bus stations with dedicated platform screen doors - one expected a train not a bus! Enjoy this short clip of yours truly geeking out over the buses! The result of good infrastructure design, planning & timetabling. What a operation! Malcolm - YTP üöÇ #buses #urbanplanning #infrastructure #publictransport #brisbanecity\n\n\"It‚Äôs often said that transit infrastructure is pedestrian infrastructure. The refrain makes sense: when you exit a bus, you evolve from passenger to pedestrian. Waiting for, and walking to and from, transit is as much a part of the experience of using transit as actually sitting aboard a bus or train. And there‚Äôs a lot that can discourage prospective passengers from boarding before even considering the equipment, scheduling, and routes.\" \"Yet, across North America, the experience of waiting for transit can be abysmal. Bus stops are demarcated by small, sun-faded signage and often nothing else.\" It doesn't have to be this way! Our new public-private partnerships put full placement control in the hands of the city and makes the 2016 report outdated. Reach out and get the details! Check out our new shaded bench too, it's the perfect solution and it's cost-free! https://lnkd.in/gHZCpjfJ\n\nWell first of light rail is separate from road traffic. Rail traffic for local commuter should be separated from commercial rail. Road traffic is a traffic timing. To give buses separate lanes you need real state most cities not have. So it comes down to traffic management. i.e. light timing.\n\nSuperelevation is the banking of a roadway at a curve, where the outer edge of the road is elevated higher than the inner edge. This design helps counteract the lateral acceleration experienced by vehicles, improving safety and comfort by reducing the tendency of vehicles to skid outward. Superelevation is commonly used on highways, railways, and other high-speed roadways to allow for smoother and safer turns.\n\nHow Do I Negotiate S Lanes? Today, I want to shed light on an innovative solution that's transforming our roads and enhancing traffic flow: S-lanes. üåü S-lanes are a game-changer in urban planning and traffic management. By creating a designated right-turn lane through a clever S-shaped configuration, these lanes not only optimise traffic but also prioritise safety. The key? A single unbroken white line that separates these lanes, serving as a clear boundary to ensure smooth merging without confusion. As professionals invested in shaping a better future, it's inspiring to witness such intelligent solutions in action. Let's celebrate the engineers, planners, and innovators behind S-lanes, making our daily commute safer and more efficient.admin@thedolphingroup.com.au #SLaneInnovation #SafeDriving #EfficientRoads üö¶"
