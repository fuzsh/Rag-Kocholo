        "text": "CityLink\n\nCityLink is a 22-kilometre road. Most of the road is eight lanes wide, with four inbound and four outbound lanes.\n\nThe Bolte Bridge and the Burnley and Domain tunnels are all part of CityLink.\n\nCityLink connects Melbourne's Monash, West Gate, and Tullamarine freeways. It also connects the city centre with Melbourne’s major airport and port.\n\nState-of-the-art pacemaker lighting was switched on inside the Burnley Tunnel in 2023. This innovative lighting is designed to help drivers maintain a consistent speed in the tunnel. Visit the Burnley Tunnel Upgrade Project page for details.\n\nCompletion date\n\nCityLink opened in two stages: Western Link in August 1999 and Southern Link in December 2000.\n\nWe completed upgrades of the southern link in 2010, the western link in October 2017, and the Burnley Tunnel in 2023.\n\nOwnership\n\nCityLink was Transurban’s first toll road and is 100% owned by Transurban. The road is under concession until 2045.\n\nMore information\n\nSee Linkt for more information\n\nWest Gate Tunnel\n\nThe West Gate Tunnel will be a 17-kilometre road connecting Melbourne’s west with the central city. The tunnel will serve as a vital alternative to the city’s heavily congested West Gate Bridge.\n\nOnce completed, this new road, including 6.8 kilometres of tunnel, will improve connections between Melbourne’s west, the city centre, and Melbourne’s major ports.\n\nThe West Gate Tunnel project includes:\n\n6.8 kilometres of new tunnel between the West Gate Freeway and the Maribyrnong River\n\ntwo additional lanes in each direction on the West Gate Freeway between the M80 Ring Road and Williamstown Road\n\nramps between the West Gate Freeway and Hyde Street for trucks carrying dangerous goods\n\na new bridge over the Maribyrnong River joining an elevated freeway above Footscray Road with connections to the Port of Melbourne, CityLink and city north\n\nmajor new cycling and walking paths and open space\n\nWe are delivering this project in partnership with the Victorian Government and the CPB Contractors John Holland Joint Venture.\n\nWe are working with our contractors to achieve sustainability ratings on the project from the Infrastructure Sustainability Council of Australia. The design stage of the project has received a Leading IS Rating.\n\nBenefits\n\nOnce completed the West Gate Tunnel will:\n\nreduce peak travel time by up to 20 minutes\n\ntake around 28,000 vehicles off West Gate Bridge, 22,000 vehicles off Bolte Bridge, and remove more than 9,000 trucks from local streets a day\n\ncreate 6,000 new jobs\n\noffer more than 14 kilometres of new cycling and walking paths\n\nprovide close to nine hectares of open space\n\ndeliver stronger roads and bridges to carry heavier loads and support Victoria’s (and Australia’s) high productivity freight network\n\nTiming and cost\n\nThis project will be funded through tolls on the West Gate Tunnel, changes to the CityLink concession, and a Victorian Government contribution.\n\nPlanning approvals were granted in December 2017 and construction started in January 2018.\n\nOwnership\n\nTransurban owns 100% of this road.\n\nProject update – temporary use of Bolte Bridge for heavy vehicles up to 85.5T\n\nPlease be advised of some upcoming nightly closures of Wurundjeri Way, between Dudley Street and Flinders Street.\n\nThese are required to safely complete the asphalting and resurfacing works required for the new road surface along Wurundjeri Way.\n\nThese upcoming works will have impacts for the freight industry. If you are a driver of a heavy vehicle, the primary detour is via Harbour Esplanade.\n\nPlease note that heavy vehicles up to 85.5T may use the approved route over the Bolte Bridge in the direction of the closure. Heavy vehicles 85.5T and over will need to use the primary detour route via Harbour Esplanade.\n\nDetour maps: northbound detour, detour for intersection closure.\n\nMore information\n\nSee the West Gate Tunnel project site for more information\n\nLearn about tolls on the West Gate Tunnel"
