        "text": "A $722 million contract to deliver the first stage of tunnelling on the Western Harbour Tunnel has been awarded to a joint venture between John Holland and CPB Contractors.\n\nPremier Dominic Perrottet said the joint venture will build about 1.7 kilometres of tunnels from Rozelle to Birchgrove.\n\n“This is a critical milestone which will support hundreds of jobs and ensure significant benefits for drivers, including improved travel times and reduced congestion,” Perrottet said.\n\n“The tunnel will not only revolutionise how we get around Sydney but also take the pressure off other major roads including the Sydney Harbour Bridge, Sydney Harbour Tunnel, Anzac Bridge and Western Distributor.\n\nThe Western Harbour Tunnel will link WestConnex at Rozelle with the Warringah Freeway at North Sydney via 6.5-kilometre tunnels under Sydney Harbour, with three lanes in each direction.\n\nRelated stories:\n\nSecond Sydney Harbour tunnel deemed national priority\n\nSandstone from Sydney Metro tunnels recycled on Western Sydney Airport\n\nSydney Metro to launch TBM under Sydney Harbour\n\nMetropolitan Roads Minister Natalie Ward said the new tunnel is part of a major infrastructure boost to expand our motorways and serve our growing city.\n\n“We all want to have the quickest and smoothest journey possible and this terrific project will slash travel times from one side of the harbour to the other,” Ward said.\n\n“You’ll save up to 20 minutes in a journey from Sydney Olympic Park to North Sydney and up to 15 minutes from North Sydney to the airport at Mascot.”\n\nMember for North Shore Felicity Wilson said that early works, including geotechnical investigations into the detailed tunnel design, will start this month.\n\n“Major construction will begin in the middle of this year, and I know drivers can’t wait to reap the rewards of this much-needed additional harbour crossing,” Wilson said.\n\nJohn Holland and CPB are currently delivering the Rozelle interchange as part of WestConnex, with the new Western Harbour Tunnel contract ensuring a continuation of tunnelling work already underway."
