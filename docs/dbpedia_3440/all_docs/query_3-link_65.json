        "text": "Contents of the article:\n\nIntroduction to Traffic Load Consideration\n\nSignificance of Influence Line Analysis\n\nMoving Load Analysis for Various Types of Bridges\n\nCase-Studies\n\nQuestions & Answers\n\n1. Introduction to Traffic Load Consideration\n\nLoads on bridges can be permanent and transient. Live Loads on bridges are typically dynamic in nature. These could be due to traffic, rolling stocks, locomotive, etc. The vertical and horizontal components could be analyzed as static analysis with appropriate dynamic amplification factors to account for the dynamic effects based on the type of bridges adhering to code provisions. Live loads applied on the structures, unlike permanent loads, do not have a fixed position on the bridge structures and can be placed at critical positions as the traffic moves over a span.\n\nHence, we would require the Moving Load Analysis, typically a Static Load Analysis finding the worst load effects out of various possible positions along the bridge based on the Influence Line analysis or influence surface analysis.\n\nFig 1. Nature of Loading on Bridges\n\n2. Significance of Influence Line Analysis\n\nDefinition: The influence line for a response function is given by the deflected shape of the released structure due to a unit displacement (or rotation) at the location and the response function's direction.\n\nResponse Function = support reaction, axial force, shear force, or Influence Line Definitions bending moment.\n\nInfluence Line/Influence surface = graph of a response function of a structure as a function of the position of a downward unit load moving across the structure.\n\nFor example, in fig.1, for the two-span continuous bridge, to obtain the maximum sagging at point “A” span, which is at the mid-span, would be loaded to create a positive influence.\n\nSimilarly, if the second span is loaded, this would have a reliving effect for the maximum sagging moment at A.\n\nFig 2.2 Calculation of maximum/minimum moments due to a distributed lane load (W)\n\n(source Analysis ref. manual)\n\nThe effect of a moving load on the magnitude of certain functions of a structure, such as support reactions, deflection, and shear force and moment, at a section of the structure, varies with the moving load position.\n\nIn the program, a set of concentrated loads would be applied considering all the loading conditions along the moving direction of the traffic to find the maximum and minimum values.\n\nHence, Influence line analysis is important in determining the critical position of moving loads.\n\n3. Moving Load analysis for various types of bridges\n\nTo find the most critical design parameters (member forces, displacements, and support reactions) in the analysis of a bridge structure, all the conditions of vehicle loads must be considered.\n\nEspecially, when a number of design vehicle load groups and traffic lanes are involved, all the conditions that may affect the design parameters must be analyzed:\n\na) if the vehicular load groups are loaded simultaneously;\n\nb) if only the critical-case design vehicle load group is to be applied among the load groups;\n\nc) if a specific lane is selected for loading the design vehicle load groups; and\n\nd) what load reduction factor is to be applied if a number of traffic lanes are loaded.\n\nDefining Moving Load definition as per the various standards is 4 step process in midas Civil.\n\nOnce the moving load analysis is completed the results will be generated using the influence line results.\n\nFig 3.1 Process flow for defining the moving load definition in midas Civil\n\nI. Selecting the Moving Load Code: Moving Load can be selected through different standards.\n\nII. Defining Traffic Line/Surface Lanes: Specify the centerline of the vehicle considering the\n\neccentric positions of the vehicles.\n\nThe distribution of the vehicular load is by two methods:\n\nLane element: Traffic Load would be applied directly to the reference elements (Vertical Concentrated load and moment). This method is applied in the case of line beam models.\n\nCross Beams: Traffic load will be applied at the actual location and will get distributed to longitudinal girders through Cross-Beams. Generally, this method is recommended for the Grillage Models.\n\nFig.3.2 Load distribution through Lane element and Cross Beams (source: online manual)\n\nAnother way of defining traffic lanes would be through the Moving Load Optimization Option.\n\nMoving Load Optimization will automatically consider the placements of the lanes in the transverse and longitudinal direction along the entire carriageway considering the positions on the Left, Right, and Center.\n\nDefining the individual traffic line lanes can be avoided through the moving load optimization option. Hence, the lanes are loaded in such a manner that it gives the most critical moving load envelops.\n\nFig.3.3 Vehicular position for Moving Load Optimization (source: online manual)\n\nIII. Defining the Vehicular load:\n\nThe standard load models according to different standards can be defined directly added.\n\nHowever, in case any User-defined loads need to be added then that case such loads can be defined through three options based on the moving traffic load code as below\n\nTruck/Lane\n\nTrain Load\n\nPermit Truck (heavy loading vehicle)\n\nIV. Defining Moving Load Cases:\n\nMoving Load cases option allows combining the different classes of vehicles in one moving load case considering the minimum and maximum lanes to be loaded.\n\nHence, the repetitive task of creating the individual load cases and then making a combination of all the vehicles can be avoided.\n\nLoading effects: Combined - Combination of vehicles.\n\nIndependent\n\n- Vehicles applied independently\n\nIn the case of complex models consisting of numerous elements, running moving load analysis can be time-consuming. However, with the moving load analysis control selecting specific girder group elements can be chosen to reduce the analysis time.\n\nHence, with the Moving load analysis control option variety of parameters such as selection filters for specific result group output can be controlled and hence the run-time of the model.\n\nIt is always recommended to cross verify the program results with simple manual calculations\n\nFig.3.4 Moving Load Case definition in midas Civil\n\n4. Case-Studies\n\ni. Line Beam Models - Case Study 1 (Rail Seat Loads)\n\nPurpose: 2D Line beam model was created to obtain the maximum reactions at the sleeper or the rail pad under the rail.\n\nConfiguration\n\nSpan: Multi-span continuous\n\nAlignment: Straight\n\nSection: UIC 60 kg/m rail\n\nMoving load: 200LA (rail)\n\nCarriageway: Single Track\n\nApplication: Traffic Line Lane\n\nUser-defined rail load can be directly specified using the User-defined vehicular load option and dynamic amplification factor for the same can be accounted for by just defining the scale factor.\n\nHowever, scale factors can be used as Impact factor/CDA, Load combination factor, etc.\n\nDynamic amplification can however be applied at the time of creating the load combination in an excel sheet. However, applying it when creating the moving load cases would be easy to get the final results.\n\nThe results of the moving load cases can be converted to static load cases.\n\nConverting moving load into a static load.\n\nWrite Min/Max Load to File\n\nFrom the envelope of all load positions, the load position most critical for a particular node can be extracted into a static load case.\n\ni. Line Beam Models - Case Study 2 (Pedestrian Bridge)\n\nPurpose: To directly incorporate the pedestrian load using the code reference and also to model the traffic live load on curvature.\n\nThe moving load on the curvature can be directly assigned just by specifying the elements numbers which are in a sequence that generally do not lie on the straight line.\n\nPedestrian load intensity is dependent on the loaded area which is predefined in midas Civil.\n\nIf for the continuous structures, different load intensities need not be assigned in case only a few or all the spans are loaded since midas Civil automatically calculates these intensities for the different loading patterns.\n\nConfiguration\n\nSpan: 4 spans continuous\n\nAlignment: Curved\n\nSection: Steel box girder\n\nMoving load: Pedestrian load\n\nCarriageway: 2 x 2.5m wide shared path\n\nApplication: Curved lane, pedestrian load\n\nThe location of the concentrated loads for the maximum sagging moments, shear, or the reactions can be obtained along with the influence line diagram\n\nSection: Super-T + Deck\n\nMoving load: SM1600, HLP320 (Road)\n\nCarriageway: 6m, 3 lanes\n\nApplication: Traffic lane for grillage, Combining vehicles\n\nSpan: 5 spans simply supported\n\nAlignment: Straight\n\nSection: Multi-girder bridge\n\nMoving load: 350LA + SM1600\n\nCarriageway: 1 Track + 1 Lane\n\nApplication: Rail + Road load, Transverse lane optimization\n\niii. Planer Models- Case Study 1 (Box Culvert)\n\nPurpose: To perform the load rating on the bridge structure\n\nConfiguration\n\nfig. Influence Surface-Mxx"
