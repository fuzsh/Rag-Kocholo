        "text": "The Sydney Harbour Bridge is a heritage-listed steel through arch bridge across Sydney Harbour that carries rail, vehicular, bicycle, and pedestrian traffic between the Sydney central business district (CBD) and the North Shore. The dramatic view of the bridge, the harbour, and the nearby Sydney Opera House is an iconic image of Sydney, and Australia itself. The bridge is nicknamed “The Coathanger” because of its arch-based design.\n\nUnder the direction of Dr John Bradfield of the NSW Department of Public Works, the bridge was designed and built by British firm Dorman Long and Co Ltd of Middlesbrough and opened in 1932. The bridge’s design was influenced by the Hell Gate Bridge in New York City. It is the sixth longest spanning-arch bridge in the world and the tallest steel arch bridge, measuring 134 m (440 ft) from top to water level. It was also the world’s widest long-span bridge, at 48.8 m (160 ft) wide, until construction of the new Port Mann Bridge in Vancouver was completed in 2012.\n\nThe Sydney Harbour Bridge was added to the Australian National Heritage List on 19 March 2007 and to the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 25 June 1999.\n\nCoordinates33°51′08″S 151°12′38″ECoordinates: 33°51′08″S 151°12′38″ECarriesBradfield HighwayNorth Shore railway line1 pedestrian way1 cyclewayCrossesPort Jackson (Sydney Harbour)LocaleSydney, Australia (Map)Official nameSydney Harbour BridgeOwnerGovernment of New South WalesMaintained byRoads and Maritime ServicesPreceded byGladesville BridgeCharacteristicsDesignThrough arch bridgeTotal length1,149 m (3,770 ft)Width48.8 m (160 ft)Height134 m (440 ft)Longest span503 m (1,650 ft)No. of spans1Clearance below49 m (161 ft) at mid-spanNo. of lanes8Rail characteristicsNo. of tracks2Track gauge1,435 mm (4 ft 8 1⁄2 in) standard gaugeElectrified1500 V DC overheadHistoryConstructed byDorman Long & CoConstruction start28 July 1923Construction end19 January 1932Inaugurated19 March 1932Opened19 March 1932StatisticsTollTime of day tolling (southbound only)\n\nPhoto’s Bing – Text Wikipedia"
