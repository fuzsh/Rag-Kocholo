        "text": "First published in The Sydney Morning Herald on August 31, 1992\n\n136,000 TREKKERS UNDER THE SEA\n\nThe wide bitumen river to Sydney Harbour streamed with people yesterday as 136,000 walkers passed out of sight and into Australia’s first underwater tunnel.\n\nIn the distance the proud outline of the Sydney Harbour Bridge was almost the last thing that they saw before cliffs of grey cement at the tunnel entrance enveloped them.\n\nThe tunnel is, by definition, a hidden addition to the city. Without the presence and grace of the bridge, it will never be a comparable landmark but clearly Sydney has already accepted it.\n\nYesterday, with an eye for history, family photographers gathered their children in front of signs deep in the tunnel that said: “You’re still 10 metres above sea level” or “you are now at sea level”.\n\n“One day you’ll be glad we were here,” said one mother, trying to coax a smile from her small daughter.\n\nA sense of history, heightened by this year’s 60th anniversary of the opening of the Harbour Bridge, appears to have been a major reason for the big turnout at the walk.\n\n“People were there because everyone realised that the tunnel was a part of Sydney’s history like the bridge,” a spokesman for the Tunnel Walk Committee, Mr Don Grattan, said.\n\n“And on top of that, they wanted to see just what it was like to be 27 metres under Sydney Harbour.”\n\nThe tunnel, which cost $750 million and took five years to build, stretches for 2.7 kilometres and will take about two minutes to drive through.\n\nFrom inside, with no sign or sound of water, it is hard to believe that the curving, cream-walled corridor is the closest encounter anyone can have with the harbour without being on a boat or in a wetsuit.\n\nThe monochromatic tunnel, featureless except for a dead-straight line of fluorescent lights up the middle of the moulded ceiling, is nonetheless an engineering feat to match the bridge.\n\nBut the first test of the four-lane tunnel’s effect on traffic flow and congestion will come this morning when it opens to peak-hour traffic.\n\nEven if it fails to lure the predicted 60,000 cars a day, the tunnel is unlikely to be as big a flop as the souvenir Sydney Harbour Tunnel rocks which, at $20 for a lump of sandstone mounted on a wooden base, went begging at a stall in The Domain.\n\n“They’re the great white elephant,” said Mr Grattan.\n\nLoading\n\nThe rocks were salvaged during the early stages of the tunnel drilling long before colossal concrete tunnel sections - each 26 metres long - were floated into place and sunk on the harbour bottom to be held there by 5,000 tonnes of water pressure."
