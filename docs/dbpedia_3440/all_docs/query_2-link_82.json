Premier Dominic Perrottet said the joint venture between John Holland and CPB will build about 1.7 kilometres of tunnels from Rozelle to Birchgrove.\n\n“This is a critical milestone which will support hundreds of jobs and ensure significant benefits for drivers, including improved travel times and reduced congestion,” Mr Perrottet said. “The tunnel will not only revolutionise how we get around Sydney but also take the pressure off other major roads including the Sydney Harbour Bridge, Sydney Harbour Tunnel, Anzac Bridge and Western Distributor.”\n\nThe Western Harbour Tunnel will link WestConnex at Rozelle with the Warringah Freeway at North Sydney via 6.5-kilometre tunnels under Sydney Harbour, with three lanes in each direction. Commuters will save up to twenty minutes in a journey from Sydney Olympic Park to North Sydney and up to 15 minutes from North Sydney to the airport at Mascot. It’s estimated the new tunnel will reduce traffic on the Western Distributor by 35 per cent, Harbour Tunnel by 20 per cent and Harbour Bridge by 17 per cent.\n\nEarly works, including geotechnical investigations into the detailed tunnel design, will start this month with major construction starting mid-year. The project is expected to finish in 2025.\n\nJohn Holland and CPB are currently delivering the Rozelle interchange as part of WestConnex, with the new Western Harbour Tunnel contract ensuring a seamless continuation of tunnelling work already underway.\n\nThe design and construct contract will generate revenue of approximately $350 million for CPB Contractors.\n\nCPB Contractors Managing Director Jason Spears said: “Our teams are currently delivering the Rozelle Interchange and will leverage that experience to ensure that the enabling works are delivered safely and to schedule. Our teams delivered the M4 widening, the M4 East, the M8, and have demonstrated capability in delivering complex transport projects in Sydney. Our aim will be to deliver the works while minimising any disruptions to the community.”\n\nThe project involves the excavation and lining of the Western Harbour Tunnel driven tunnels, including ventilation tunnels, between the stubs provided by the Rozelle Interchange and Birchgrove Oval.\n\nSource: Liberal Party of Australia/NSW Division – View the full Media Release here\n\nSource: CPB – View the full Media Release here\n\nShare via:"
