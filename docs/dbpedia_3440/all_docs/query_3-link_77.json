        "text": "Moving back to Melbourne Alas will be leaving Sydney in the next few months having settled on a property on the Mornington Peninsula, Melbourne. Over the next 12 to 18 months will still be involved in a few of Sydney projects until they closeout. Also back in Sydney in November to present at the 5th ICTG (https://lnkd.in/gfenTn3i). Originally transferred to Sydney for the Sydney Harbour Tunnel from Melbourne, and that was 35 years ago! Have been winding down my consulting business over the past 12 months and this has given me the opportunity for other pursuits. This has included continuing researching AI for tunnelling(one conference paper already published) and taking up Radio Controlled yacht racing here in Sydney(the DF65 class). Both to be continued in Melbourne with the latter at National Water Sports Centre at Patterson Lakes, about 20 minutes drive from where we will be living. The photo here is from the NWSC earlier this year as a guest and with a DF95 yacht kindly lent to me by one of the RC yacht club members. Have also joined the Mornington Yacht Club on Port Philip Bay so I have hopefully planned a good exit strategy to full retirement in the the next few years, if that is what I decide to do. If you are interested in seeing what RC yacht racing is all about go to these two video links. https://lnkd.in/guVPxcCP https://lnkd.in/gNRw75zS Each club race only lasts between 10 and 20 minutes depending on the course length and wind speed. At each meet there might be between 8 and 10 races. There are also State, National Australian and World Championship events.\n\nThe most complex section of road in Australia to get even more complex? Received advice last month that my abstract for my paper ‘Reflections on a flawed planning process for the Western Harbour Road Tunnel, Sydney’, has been accepted for the 5th International Conference on Transportation Geotechnics, ICTG, Sydney, November 2024. Unfortunately, the new NSW State Government, having delayed the Northern Beaches Road Tunnel, note not cancelled, is rumoured to be considering delaying the completion of Mona Vale Road (Stage 2). So, on the north shore we could have the situation where two major multi-lane roads, carrying heavy traffic, are joined together by a single laned road, only a few kilometres long. This will be a massive step backwards, apart from providing an alternative route when Wakehurst Parkway is flooded, providing better access to the northern beaches in the summer season, it appears any such decision goes against the NSW State Government’s stated commitment to increase the population density on the northern beaches! The Western Harbour Tunnel should have been extended to go beyond Chatswood and avoid “the most complex section of road in Australia”(previous NSW State Government words, not mine) at North Sydney altogether. Hopefully, the Northern Beaches Road tunnel will never go ahead and my alternative of an East-West tunnel from the Roseville Bridge to Macquarie under Chatswood gets considered. The Pacific Highway north-south heavy traffic and the traffic chaos at Chatswood caused by east-west traffic wanting to use Boundary Street is a much bigger problem than Military Road, Mosman, a problem that was never addressed in the totally discredited planning and EIS process.\n\nBuilding Around Tunnels Seminar - download proceedings The intention of initiating the seminar “Buildings Around Existing Tunnels” was to bring both experienced practitioners and others together so that the industry would move forward from what I perceive are delays in building approvals process caused either a lack of knowledge or management skills in a segment of the industry which appears to some extent pass under the radar. While there is much focus on new tunnel projects there is also an ever-increasing potential for conflict between new urban development in our growing urban cities with the increasing number of new underground development (transport tunnels, sewer, telecommunications etc) and taller buildings with deeper basements! They are both fighting for, and in some extreme cases, the same underground space! So here is a link to the seminar papers (from around Australia and one from overseas) and some of the Power Point Presentations given by the authors to download. The one-day seminar in Sydney attracted 11 final papers submissions, however, the initial response for abstracts was 23. If we can achieve this in Sydney, I am sure larger cities around the world could run similar seminars from which we can all share from our collective experiences. https://lnkd.in/gJVnrHBF\n\nReflections on Magnificant Melbourne On holiday from Sydney in Melbourne, my home town, over Xmas and the New Year break it is pleasing to be able to admire how accessible the bay is to Melbourne's 5 million or so inhabitants compared to Sydney Harbour. Having spent 10 years sailing on Port Phillip Bay from the Black Rock Yacht Club and later sailing on a very crowded Sydney Harbour when I first moved to Sydney in 1986, for the Sydney Harbour Tunnel, I believe I am qualified to make this comparison. Sailing is a very fickled sport as the elements are unpredictable, a good training ground for a later career that includes geomechanics and tunnelling! Also of the small sailing dinghys - Mirrors and Cherubs, I sailed and raced, the Cherub was completed by me using a professionally built hull shell as a starting point. A great training ground for understanding that quality construction is important and of the structural properties of laminated timber and adhesives (Port Phillip Bay can get very rough and windy). That latter experience with adhesives was to help me later in writing a specifciation for the bonding of aluminium and rubber as part of the repairs to the MURL rail viaduct between Flinders Street and the then Spencer Street railway station. I was also knowledgable enough to know I needed help, so I went to the CSIRO building research group for advice carrying a cardboard box of unsuccessful test samples. Melbourne has some problems though, particularly traffic congestion in the CBD, better to walk, makes Sydney's traffic congestion management-infrastructure by-passing the CBD look good, hard to believe if you have not experienced the Melbourne CBD traffic. On the postive side the rail-road grade separation project across Melbourne has been a huge success. Notable for us has been the drive down to Frankston and the massive improvement to traffic flow along the Nepean Highway. So one of the take aways of this story is that sport is a vital part of any childs development, and particularly so in my case, and second, Melbourne is a very livable city with easy access to the bay and with vistas that more than complete with Sydney. This might be the reason why my wife and I are assessing moving back to Melbourne to Mount Martha on the Mornington Peninsula with the bay on one side and the ocean on the other. Has an unrelated sport (or other non-formal education activity) as a young person helped you in anyway in your later career?

Why was an immersed tube tunnel even advocated in the first place? With the now proposed 16m diameter TBM the risk of water ingress during tunnel construction of a shallow approach tunnel (taken to be excavated by road headers) to an immersed tube tunnel under the very narrow Birch Grove Peninsula has also now been eliminated. The planning process for both the WHT and the Beaches Link Tunnel (BLT) has been a debacle. For example, the BLT EIS states that the Northern Beaches geography is unsuitable for rail? Transport for NSW cannot provide a report that supports this opinion (the method used to circumvent the legal requirement of an EIS to consider alternatives). In the 1920s Bradfield proposed a train service from North Sydney railway station down to the Northern Beaches. In fact, two tunnels were excavated at the station including a crossover tunnel. That is why there are four tunnel portals visible at the western end of the platforms at this station. Of course, given the fact that a TBM is now being used the opportunity to drop the BLT should be taken and the WHT extended to under and beyond Chatswood, say just short of Mona Vale Road. The BLT should be replaced by an East-West Tunnel linking the Roseville Bridge with the Sydney Orbital at Macquarie as per the image with this post. The real increasing traffic congestion issues are at Chatswood and along the Pacific Highway, not Mosman, or even the Split Bridge. But of course, the study area for both the WHT and BLT EIS did not include Chatswood.\n\nWestern Australia's regional power grid is dismantled #reneweables #farming #grid #SPS Devastating summer bushfires torched the power poles and knocked Craig's Poultney's farm off-grid. But the installation of solar panels and batteries that were installed the following winter has permanently eliminated a repeat of this scenario. Before the fires, electricity travelled across the state to get to the family home, beginning its journey at one of several coal-fired power stations at least 200km away. For about the last 10km of the journey, it was travelling down power lines that had few other users, meaning the cost-per-customer of supplying that was enormous. Now, the power travels about 40 metres. In Western Australia, an ambitious project to take thousands of properties off-grid is slowly taking shape. Electricity poles are being cut down and carted away. Thousands of kilometres of overhead wiring are being rolled up. In its place are what essentially are beefed-up farming versions of the standard suburban rooftop solar and battery systems. The cumulative effect of the planned rollout will be enormous: 23,000km of wire will be taken down. reference: ABC news - triple j Hack https://lnkd.in/g_WQpcwK\n\nWhen Fossil Fuels Run Out, What Then? #energy #energysecurity #renewablenergy #fossilfuels Often overlooked in the debate about climate change (for and against) is that fossil fuels are a finite resource. Without the widespread adoption of renewables this limited resource will diminish and quite rapidly. According to the 2019 Annual Energy Outlook global GDP growth between 2017 and 2040 is expected to average 3.4%. The world energy demand will grow by 1/3 through 2040, driven mostly by rising consumption in transportation in China, India and parts of Asia. The adoption of renewables worldwide seems now to be in full swing, so hopefully the end game scenario of the graph below for fossil fuel reserves will never eventuate. As an example of the truly seismic changes in progress, the owners of the Newcastle Tomago aluminium smelter (the largest user of electricity in NSW, if not Australia, using a coal fired power station as the source of electrical energy) are planning to switch to renewables by 2029 (ref \"The Australian\" newspaper, 26Sep2022). One of the owners Rio Tinto, also has the same ambition for its aluminium smelters in Queensland. No doubt other major corporations around the world are following the same trajectory as Rio Tinto, so expect the energy world to change exponentially (including the adoption of EVs in all forms -private - commercial - and especially the construction industry) over the next 10 years. Within 5 years you might see construction contracts being tendered for that require contractors to not use fossil fuels in any form. Believe it or not! Reference: https://lnkd.in/gPSzwRHA"
