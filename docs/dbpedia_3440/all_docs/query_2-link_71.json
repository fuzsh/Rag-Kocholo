        "text": "Come and join the Commercial & Technology team in Legal at Transport for NSW! TfNSW has one of the largest inhouse legal teams in the NSW govt (around 100 lawyers spread across 5 practice areas). The Commercial & Technology team in TfNSW Legal has about 30 amazing lawyers - mostly with backgrounds in private practice. This role includes flex leave - plus our Tuesday afternoon chocolates and snakes (lollies not the real ones).\n\nI was so proud to be at the official opening of the 7.5km twin mega tunnels that extend the M4 and M8 motorways and provide a critical link between the M4 at Haberfield and the M8 at St Peters. This $3.2 billion project is now open and is a game-changer for how people travel across Sydney. Along the way, the project created more than 12,000 jobs and was completed months ahead of schedule and on budget. A huge congratulations to all of our Transport teams, our partner WestConnex and our many industry partners who have been working on the delivery of this stage of WestConnex for the last four years. Later this year the M4 and M8 extensions will connect to the Rozelle Interchange, completing WestConnex, Australia's largest road infrastructure project. WestConnex will also have links to many of our other projects in delivery - the M6 Stage 1, the Western Harbour Tunnel and Sydney Gateway, which will provide new connections to the Sydney Airport precinct in late 2024. Well done to all involved! #TransportforNSW #WestConnex #Infrastructure\n\nGreat to be on Darug land adjacent to the new Western Sydney Airport today for the sod turning for the M12 motorway, which by 2036 will carry 52,000 vehicles a day. Congratulations to our contractors who are now on site, Seymour Whyte and the CPB and Georgiou Joint Venture. The motorway will be ready in time for the new airport opening in 2026. #infrastructure #transportfornsw #motorway\n\nFantastic to be part of Atlassian Central as development of the pioneering $1.4 billion office tower in Sydney's future Tech Precinct reached a major milestone with agreement finalised between Atlassian, Transport and Dexus. The 75,000-square-metre building will set a model for the Tech Central precinct. Transport has been involved in the project since 2017 and in the last few months has been working closely with Enterprise NSW as the owners of the Tech Central strategy alongside Greater Cities Commission to achieve this milestone. #atlassian #dexus #tech #transportfornsw\n\nOn Friday evening Transport awarded the contract for the Coffs Harbour Bypass project to Gamuda Ferrovial JV – a new industry partner for Transport. The bypass is a $2.2 billion piece of infrastructure that upgrades around 14 kilometres of the Pacific Highway taking thousands of vehicles out of the centre of town by delivering four lanes of divided motorway. Really proud to be working with our partners on this project, one that will significantly improve the lives of the area’s residents and that will create 600 jobs during construction over the next four years. #transportfornsw #infrastructure #construction"
