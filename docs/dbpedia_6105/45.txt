The Walk Television Network is changing ownership but its mission will continue to operate as a nationwide television network designed to educate viewers “to better comprehend and appreciate the rich Judeo-Christian legacy and to apply such principles to their daily lives.”

TW Broadcasting, LLC, the new owner of The Walk TV, will be operating the network from the facilities of WGGS TV in Greenville, South Carolina. WGGS is one of the longest running Christian television stations in the United States.

A new website and on-air look for The Walk TV debuted during the National Religious Broadcasters Convention in February 2020. Viewers can access The Walk TV through its network of broadcast affiliates and through online streaming accessible on the website and on Roku.

While “A New Journey Begins” on The Walk, TW Broadcasting thanks Jim West and his staff for the vision for the launch of this network and the many years of dedication in providing a platform to:

Explore the Past-through documentaries, teaching, biographies, dramas to better understand ourselves, our culture, our heritage and the principles upon which America was founded.

Enjoy the Present-by visiting favorite destinations, local festivals and get to know the unique people who have made this country great, learning about contemporary political and social issues and seeing them from a biblical perspective.
