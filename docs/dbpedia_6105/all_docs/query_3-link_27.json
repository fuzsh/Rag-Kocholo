        "text": "News\n\nApril 19, 2012 - I was a musical guest on the television show, Atlanta Live. My good friend, pianist George Allgood, accompanied me on all my selections, which included \"I Am Your Servant\" and \"I'll See You At The House,\" a song I wrote with Babbie Mason. As I always do, I had a great time at WATC TV 57, and the host, Betty Cornett, did a great job shedding light on the plight of those who are victims of human trafficking.\n\nApril 13 - 14, 2012 - Along with hit songwriter, Donna Douglas, I was a guest writer at Babbie Mason's Inner Circle for Songwriters at her home in Bowdon, Georgia. It was a wonderful time of worship, fellowship and learning. I shared from some of my own personal songwriting experiences and tried to offer encouragement to the aspiring writers who cared enough about their craft to attend. It was a great weekend.\n\nMarch 24, 2012 - At the Eastern Tennessee Daffodil Society's show in Maryville (just outside Knoxville), all of my entries received first place ribbons, including HK6-08, a sibling to the head-turning green-cupped daffodil I had shown in Atlanta the week before!\n\nMarch 17, 2012 - I had a successful day at the American Daffodil Society's Southeastern Regional Show in Roswell, Georgia (suburban Atlanta). Several of my entries faced formidable competition, but all of my flowers took first place ribbons except one, which took a third. Of particular interest to many was my green-cupped seedling, HK2-08, a product of Dr. Harold Kooopowitz's breeding program.\n\nFebruary 5, 2012 - I was a musical guest at Cross Roads Baptist Church, Westminster, South Carolina. I sang Phil McHugh's great song, \"One Day\" for Cross Roads' annual Friends' Day celebration.\n\nJanuary 5, 2012 - Babbie Mason and I completed \"Seven Days Without Jesus (Makes One Weak).\"\n\nNovember 14, 2011 - I was privileged to speak to the Walhalla Rotary Club in my hometown about how mentors have impacted me and why we should invest in others.\n\nSeptember 28, 2011 - I was a guest on Atlanta Live, a two-hour long variety program at WATC TV 57 in Atlanta. The episode was hosted by Rick Goins. I sang six songs, including two self-penned numbers. George Allgood did an excellent job accompanying me on three songs. Atlanta Live is seen throughout the metro Atlanta area as well as nationally on the NRB network.\n\nJuly 13, 2011 - I appeared on Nite Line, the live prime time variety show of WGGS TV 16 in Greenville, South Carolina. I was interviewed by hosts Rev. Bill and Evangelist Ann Critser, and performed six songs. My good friend, George Allgood, accompanied me on several selections.\n\nMay 24, 2011 - The African American National Biography published my biographies of blues legend Johnny Shines, Charleston blacksmith/metal artist Philip Simmons and professional football player/recording executive J. Mayo \"Ink\" Williams. The AANB is published by Harvard University's W.E.B. DuBois Institute and Oxford University Press, and is co-edited by Henry Louis Gates Jr. and Evelyn Brooks Higginbotham.\n\nMay 17, 2011 - Babbie Mason and I penned \"I'll See You At The House,\" a song we believe is a strong southern gospel pitch.\n\nApril 18, 2011 - Babbie Mason and I added the finishing touches to our composition, \"Look At Me Now.\"\n\nMarch 26, 2011 - At the American Daffodil Society Southeastern Regional Show in Knoxville on the beautiful University of Tennessee campus, my four entries won a first, two seconds and an Honorable Mention. I was very excited that my first place-winning 'Coobar' was a contender for Best in Show. Though it did not win the top award, I was thrilled to have two consecutive shows in which one of my daffodils was under consideration for Best Bloom.\n\nMarch 19, 2011 - Among my fourteen entries at the Georgia Daffodil Society Show in Roswell (suburban Atlanta), I won three firsts, four seconds and a third. My winner, 'Hot Gossip', was also awarded the Gold Ribbon for Best in Show!\n\nProjects in the Works\n\nSeptember 29, 2011 - Check back for some exciting articles coming up. As promised earlier in the year, I will be publishing some exciting interviews. Recently, actor Jesse James talked with Southern Edition about his role in The Last Ride, Benjy Gaither's film about Hank Williams' last three days. Additionally, I will be featuring a separate interview with Benjy. So be sure to drop by within the next two to three weeks for these stories. Better yet, connect with me or join the SouthernEdition.com Social Network on Facebook, and you will be the very first to know about the latest news at Southern Edition.\n\nApril 4, 2011 - In addition to gearing up for more positive changes to Southern Edition, I am planning to publish articles on topics as diverse as James Agee and antique roses. And I hope to secure several important interviews later this year to coincide with certain events.\n\nCurrently, I am writing a book proposal and working on some rather personal (and hopefully artful and well-crafted!) essays that I will be submitting to various literary magazines. And I plan to begin work on a recording project later this summer, if I can manage to raise the funds!\n\nGod has blessed me with all sorts of creativity, and He continues to amaze me with open doors I could have never envisioned. Through my singing, songwriting, articles, photographs and even my attempts at drawing, painting and sculpting, the Lord has allowed me to view creation.....humanity and my own frailty, in particular.....in a different light, and I have learned to see beauty all around me, find importance in the seemingly insignificant things and recognize the hand of God at work in my life each time He allows me to lift my voice to sing, pick up a pen to write a song, sit down at my keyboard to type an article or shape a piece of lifeless clay."
