        "text": "\"Where there is no vision, the people perish.\"\n\nProverbs 29:18\n\nSince 1803, Mud Creek Baptist Church has been actively sharing the gospel of Jesus Christ as proclaimed by the Apostle Paul in 1 Corinthians 15:2 through 8, \"By this gospel you are saved 'Christ died for our sins according to the Scriptures, that he was buried, that he was raised on the third day according to the Scriptures, and that he appeared to Peter, and then to the Twelve. After that, he appeared to more than 500 of the brothers at the same time' to James, then to all the apostles, and last of all he appeared to me.\"\n\nTwenty-seven years ago in 1980, when Rev. Greg T. Mathis became the Senior Pastor at Mud Creek Baptist, he was advised to grow his new church by changing its name and location. He chose neither, deciding instead to continue his faithful presentation of this gospel message, explaining in exciting detail the relevant, life-giving properties of Scripture. \"My preaching is expository, covering the books of the Bible, its characters, and the doctrines of faith. That's the way to grow a congregation.\"\n\nIn his book, Excellent Protestant Congregations, Professor Paul Wilkes from the University of North Carolina at Wilmington has identified Mud Creek Baptist Church as one of the most excellent places of worship in America. Meaningful ministries and inspiring worship abound at this Hendersonville church on the corner of Rutledge Road and Erkwood Drive.\n\nThe salvation message is consistently shared through preaching by Mathis and his Associate Pastor of Ministries, Mark Hunnicutt. The 90 small groups, including Sunday School, are designed for common edification and Christian instruction. Along with the vibrant music ministry of the Rev. Chris Roberts, Associate Pastor of Music and Worship, they offer opportunities for personal involvement and growth.\n\nThe choir's dramatic presentation of both the Christmas and Easter stories is a ministry outreach to an appreciative community. For nearly t20 years, the Easter performance has thrilled audiences. It's the longest, continuously running presentation in western North Carolina, portraying in music and drama the story of Christ's death on the cross, his burial and glorious resurrection.\n\nAccording to its Web site, www.mudcreekchurch.org, \"Mud Creek Baptist Church exists to serve the purpose of God for our generation,\" and prayer is always before the Lord for his guidance to accomplish this mission. As a result, three new ministries have begun, which Hunnicutt explains, \"are to further a vision to reach even more people, to be even better stewards and to get even more people involved.\"\n\nThe evening of Easter Sunday will see the \" 'Kickoff' Celebration Service\" of the Mud Creek Baptist Church at North Greenville University. Starting at 6:15 p.m. in Turner Chapel on the NGU campus, this event will feature preaching by Mathis and worship led by Chris Roberts and the MCBC choir and orchestra. Childcare is provided for this and each following Sunday night service.\n\n\"The vision,\" Mathis shares, \"is to raise up a New Testament Church similar to Mud Creek Baptist, one that will be on its own in the next four to six years.\"\n\nFamilies in one of the fastest-growing regions in the South, the area from the N.C. state line to north of Travelers Rest, S.C., have received invitations \"to help ignite a new church on the North Greenville University campus.\" An agreement of mutual benefit with the university provides this initial worship site for the church, while in the fall students in the Hendersonville vicinity will be able to take NGU satellite classes at MCBC.\n\nThe second in their visionary ministry to reach more people with the gospel message is the start of Saturday Night Church. Making good use of a normally empty sanctuary, SNC also officially begins tonight.. Running from 5:15 to 6:15 p.m., this service is designed to offer an opportunity for worship to the 35 percent of the community who are either employed on Sundays or who work a swing shift. It's also an opportunity to reach the younger generation. Small groups will meet afterwards at 6:20. Childcare will be available for families.\n\nHunnicutt will give a message each Saturday evening based upon Mathis' Sunday morning sermon theme and text. Under Roberts' direction, Stephen Cope will lead a comfortable blend of contemporary and traditional Christian music.\n\nThe third exciting vision to be undertaken this year, Video Venue, began in March and is part of the Worship on Wednesday, W.O.W, opportunity. Beginning at 7:15 p.m. in the Family Life Center, the church gym, it follows the regular mid-week dinner, served from 5 to 6:30 p.m. in this location.\n\nIn this informal, more casual setting, all are invited to meet under the direction of a leadership team to enjoy music, worship and each other. The regular Wednesday night preaching by Mathis will be transmitted by live video feed from the sanctuary to the gym.\n\nIf it's not possible to make one of the five services: Sundays at 8:30, 9:45, 11 a.m. and 6:15 p.m., and Wednesdays at 7:15 p.m., there are still options for participation. The Internet provides a connection for individuals here and around the world, even in Iraq, where correspondence is received from soldiers appreciative for the encouragement of a service from home.\n\n\"A Clear Word\" from Mud Creek is broadcast on WGGS TV on Sundays at 8:30 a.m. and at 10:30 p.m. On Wednesdays at 7:15 p.m., WTZQ, AM 1600 Radio, provides the opportunity to listen live to the evening service.\n\nMathis sums up the gospel mission of Mud Creek Baptist by identifying this team of ministers, Hunnicut, Roberts, Cope and himself as, \"Back to back but heading in the same direction. We see people hungry and searching for the truth. God is bringing the mission field to us, but it's not about becoming larger. We're about reaching people for Christ, sincerely sharing the gospel with everyone.\""
