        "text": "When you first enter this city, Yopy will appear and battle you. This is the first time that she's battled you that you're not with Mr. Vzvoz. The only difference on her team is that she added a Kasakozog, so now her team is Mienflux, Yanmage, Tuvelena, Kasakozog, Mudsdale, and her starter (in final form). Once you beat her, you can explore the city. There are 3 paths to the north of South Port Alki: 2 that go to North Port Alki and one that goes to Amaze-All HQ, but all three are blocked because the roads are closed. The next step is to take on the Gym here, so do that next.\n\nWhen you exit the Gym after getting the Arcade Badge, the Yyyezu Alarm goes off. It turns out Amaze-All is trying to summon the legendary Pokemon, Manadza in Pokemon Summer, or Arctoyield in Pokemon Winter! You must stop them! Now, the way to Amaze-All HQ is no longer closed, so you need to go there to stop Amaze-All!\n\nAfter you've defeat Tom Bezzle in the Amaze-All HQ, you find that for some reason, Professor Fir is here. He says that he's gathered information on Amaze-All. They went through Route 8 to get to Mt. Wmest, the central mountain in the Kaskade region, where Manadza(Pokemon Summer)/Arctoyield (Pokemon Winter) is said to live. Go back through Wggs Cave 2 to the Mixed Wild Area, and from there go to Route 8."
