        "text": "WYCW is the CW affiliate for the Greenville/Spartanburg/Asheville market, licensed to and based in Asheville, North Carolina. It broadcasts on digital channel 7.11 (a subcarrier of CBS affiliate WSPA) while being displayed on tuners as virtual 62. The analog signal was shut down on February 17, 2009. Its subcarrier on 45.2 had been a retransmission WSPA, whose transmitter was destroyed by high winds in March 2009. The two stations share a studio building in Spartanburg. WSPA is no longer repeated on WYCW's subchannel.\n\nWYCW started as independent WASV/analog channel 62, a low-powered station simulcasting religious fare with Greenville station WGGS/channel 16. In 1995, channel 62 was co-opped with WSPA. The then-new WB network had aired under secondary affiliation on WSPA. It would subsequently move to channel 62 in 1997 with UPN as secondary affiliation. The station also aired NBC and CBS shows blacked out by the market's regular affiliates.\n\nChannel 62 would lose the WB in 1997 to WBSC/channel 40 in Anderson, S.C. (today MyNetworkTV outlet WMYA). In 2006, channel 62 became the market's CW affiliate after the WB and UPN shut down and merged.\n\nWYCW is currently co-owned with WSPA, who produces and staffs WYCW's local newscasts. As a result of the digital spectrum incentive auction and the spectrum ending at channel 36 when repacking starts, WYCW has ceased broadcast operations on digital 45 and has gone into a channel sharing agreement with WSPA, broadcasting on one of WSPA's subchannels (when the repacking commences WSPA will relocate their broadcasts to channel 11). They would remain in operations and retain 62 as their virtual.\n\nDigital programming\n\nVirtual Physical Name Programming 62.1 7.11 WYCW-DT Main WYCW (CW) 62.3 7.13 WYCW-DT3 Get TV\n\nCurrent CW Prime-Time Schedule (Ch. 62.1)\n\nDay 7:00 7:30 8:00 8:30 9:00 9:30 10:00 10:30 11:00 Monday Family Guy The King of Queens Ride Wild Cards CW News at 10 The King of Queens Family Guy Tuesday Crime Nation Wednesday Wild Cards Family Law Thursday The Conners The Conners Son of a Critch Children Ruin Everything Friday Penn & Teller\n\nFool Us Totally Funny Kids Totally Funny Animals Saturday Family Guy College basketball House Sunday CW Movie The Conners That 70's Show That 70's Show"
