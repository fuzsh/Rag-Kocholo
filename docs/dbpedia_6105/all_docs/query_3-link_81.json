(2021), on which my song \"I Owe You Everything\" appears, was among the nominees for Southern Gospel Album of the Year.\n\nMarch 18, 2022 - At the East Tennessee Daffodil Society Show in Knoxville, I won two American Daffodil Society Awards: the Lavender Ribbon (for best five miniature stems) and the White Ribbon (for best three stems).\n\nMarch 12, 2022 - At the Georgia Daffodil Society Show at the Chattahoochee Nature Center in Roswell, Georgia (suburban Atlanta), I took several major American Daffodil Society Awards, including the Purple Ribbon (for best five stem collection in show), Rose Ribbon (for best standard seedling in the show) and the Marie Bozievich Ribbon (for best collection of twelve stems from four different daffodil divisions).\n\nFebruary 25, 2022 - At the Atlanta Botanical Garden Flower Show, I won multiple blue ribbons with succulents and daffodils, and my own homebred daffodil seedling GSF-10A-17-01 ('Katrina Rea' x Koopowitz seedling HK2-08) won the prestigious Propagation Award.\n\n2021\n\nNovember 19, 2021 - The Grammy-nominated gospel group, the Collingsworth Family, released its project, Just Sing!, a Gaither Music CD/DVD that contains \"I Owe You Everything.\" The song was co-written by Babbie Mason and myself.
