        "text": "Travelers Rest, often abbreviated to T.R. is a city in Greenville County, South Carolina, United States. The population was 4,576 at the 2010 census. It is part of the Greenville–Mauldin–Easley Metropolitan Statistical Area. Travelers Rest is located between the Blue Ridge Mountains and Greenville, the primary city of The Upstate region. The campus of Furman University is located within the city limits of Travelers Rest, but the university retains a Greenville address based on ZIP code boundary. The name \"Travelers Rest\" came from the fact that it is situated almost directly against the border with the North Carolina mountains. Travelers would stop for a moment in the town before they began the difficult journey into the mountains."
