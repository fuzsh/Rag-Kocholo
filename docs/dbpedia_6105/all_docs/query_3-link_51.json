Since then, the mission has built the Himalayan Conference and Retreat Center where hundreds of pastors are given the Biblical training they need to lead their churches in the region. In the last five years, the mission has helped build 35 churches across the Himalayan mountain region, which covers parts of India and China.\n\nSilal said he heard the gospel of Jesus Christ when he was 18, after being invited to a church by a college classmate. He went on to attend the Christ for the Nations Institute in Dallas, and has since translated the New Testament into Nepalese.\n\n\"Our goal is to train the leaders who can then train others,\" Silal said.\n\nSilal will arrive in Anderson on June 27 and will remain in the area until July 1. His stop here in Anderson is part of a three-month stay in the United States as he spreads word of the mission. Silal said he has already been to Dallas ? the American headquarters for the mission ? and to Florida, Kansas and Colorado.\n\nWhile in Anderson, Silal will make appearances on local radio and television networks and will host a Bible study and prayer group at an Anderson home. The public is invited to the prayer group and Bible study, which will be held at the home of Roberta Basham, an Anderson resident.\n\nBasham has known Silal for years, even before she moved to Anderson. Silal will be part of the Nite Line show on WGGS, Channel 16, in Greenville, will also appear on an Atlanta Christian television station.\n\nWhen he leaves Anderson, Silal will travel to Atlanta, where he will be the guest speaker for a three-day conference at a Nepali Christian church, Basham said."
