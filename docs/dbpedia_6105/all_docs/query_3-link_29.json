You may be contacted by phone, email or text and asked to complete a confidential survey. Please take the time to complete the survey. Your feedback will help us know what we’re doing well and where we can improve.\n\nPrivacy Practices Patient Rights & Responsibilities Concerns About Your Care\n\nFast facts about your stay.\n\nSupport for Caregivers\n\nWe encourage patients to pick a key person to support them during their hospital stay. Whether you are that primary support person, or just one of many people caring for and supporting your loved one, you can play an important role in making sure your loved one gets the safest and best care both here and beyond the hospital.\n\nPatient and Family Care\n\nWe participate in patient- and family-centered care. We believe that family plays an important role in ensuring the health and well-being of patients of all ages. Our goal is to create partnerships among healthcare practitioners, patients and families that will lead to the best outcomes and enhance the delivery of safe, quality, efficient, effective, and timely care.\n\nWhat to Know Before You Leave\n\nCaregivers can help ensure the best outcome for their loved one after a hospital stay by getting the answers to these three questions:\n\nWhat is the next step for medical care (home or facility, follow-up with primary care physician or physical therapy, etc.)? Help your loved one arrange the details to make this happen—financial plan, transportation, scheduling, etc.\n\nWhat new and former medicines does my loved one need to take? Help your loved one understand the details—timing, dosing instructions, side effects, prescription refills, etc.\n\nWhat health warning signs do I need to watch for and what do I do if they happen? Help your loved one by writing these symptoms down as well as the name and contact number to call.\n\nIf you feel like you need a break or help, reach out to friends and family. And consult the resources listed here: National Alliance for Caregiving | Family Caregiver Alliance | Caregiver Action Network\n\nFacts About Your Stay\n\nBedside Shift Report\n\nWe want you to feel comfortable and cared for throughout your stay, so at each nursing shift change—about every 12 hours—your nurse will introduce your new nurse to you.

The more you’re involved, the better and safer your care.\n\nBack to Top\n\nBedside Technology\n\nDuring your stay, you may see your doctors and nurses using computers or tablets.
