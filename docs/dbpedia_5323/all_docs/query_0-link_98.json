        "text": "Esther Rolle was born in Pompano Beach, Florida, attended Yale University, won an Emmy award and was the first woman to receive the NAACP Chairman's Civil Rights Leadership Award.\n\nThe anniversary of both her birth and death are in November, and to celebrate the achievements of this amazing woman, who is also buried in Pompano Beach, The Rock Road Restoration Historical Group will present a special exhibit at The Historic Ali Cultural Arts Center (www.aliarts.org), which will run from November 1 through December 2, 2017.\n\nThe exhibition is free and open to the public.\n\n\"We are honored that Hazel Armbrister, a Pompano Beach historian, along with Ms. Rolle's family members, Janice Rolle and Carter Allen, have coordinated this inspiring exhibit,\" said Cherolyn Davis, director of programs and facilities. \"Pompano Beach is very proud of all of the accomplishments Esther Rolle achieved during her illustrious career.\"\n\nThe award-winning actress still has a family home on NW 3rd Avenue, which has since been renamed in her honor.\n\n\"We look forward to celebrating Esther Rolle's legacy through this photographic exhibit and introducing her impact to a new generation,\" continuEd Davis.\n\nBorn in Pompano Beach, Florida in 1922, Rolle was the 10th of 18 children, and her father was a farmer. An older sister, Estelle Evans, also an actress, memorably played Calpurnia in the film version of Harper Lee's To Kill a Mockingbird (1962).\n\nAfter graduating from high school, Rolle pursued an acting career by travelling to New York and becoming one of the early members of the Negro Ensemble Company, which in 1969 performed at the Aldwych, London in God is a (Guess What?) and in the late 1950s she performed with Shogola Obola, an African-American dance troupe.\n\nIn 1964 she made her film debut in Nothing But a Man and her Broadway debut in James Baldwin's Blues for Mr. Charlie. The following year she appeared in another Broadway play by Baldwin, The Amen Corner. Other important stage appearances included Lady Macbeth in an off-Broadway version of Macbeth (1977), and as the matriarch Lena Younger in a tour of Lorraine Hansberry's A Raisin in the Sun (1987). Later film appearances included Cleopatra Jones (1973) and Driving Miss Daisy(1989). Her final film appearance will be in Down in the Delta, directed by Maya Angelou.\n\nIn 1971 Rolle started her television career with regular appearances in the daytime soap One Life to Live, and the following year she made her first appearance in Maude. Its spin-off, Good Times, was launched in 1974, and told the story of a struggling buT Loving family on Chicago's South Side. It made a star out of Jimmie Walker, who played the older son JJ, and his trademark saying \"Dyn-O-Mite!\" became a national catchphrase. Though the series was not shown in Britain, it was adapted by London Weekend Television in 1976 as The Fosters, starring Norman Beaton and Lenny Henry.\n\nNBC's Summer of My German Soldier (1978) was a made-for- television movie set in Georgia during one summer of the Second World War. It followed the bittersweet romance between a teenage Jewish girl (Kristy McNichol) and an escaped Nazi prisoner of war (Bruce Davison). Rolle's portrayal of Ruth, the proud and defiant domestic who protects the teenager, earned her an Emmy award as Best Supporting Actress.\n\nShe followed this with another memorable performance as the strong grandmother in I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings (1979). This was CBS's made-for-television movie version of Maya Angelou's eloquent memoir of her days as a gifted youngster growing up in the South during the Depression.\n\nFrom the 1970s, Rolle made numerous guest appearances in top-rated television series including The Incredible Hulk (1979), Love Boat (1983) and Murder She Wrote (1985). In 1981 she played a leading role in NBC's Momma the Detective, a pilot for a crime drama series that never materialized; she was cast as a housekeeper with an uncanny knack for solving crimes. In 1989 she appeared in a television version of A Raisin in the Sun.\n\nIn 1990 she became the first woman to receive the NAACP's Civil Rights Leadership Award for her work improving the image of blacks.\n\nThe Historic Ali Cultural Arts is located at 353 MLK Blvd, Pompano Beach, FL 33060. For more information, www.aliarts.org or call 954-786-7876\n\nThe Historic Ali Cultural Arts is located in the former home of the late Frank and Florence Major Ali, who had emigrated from Cuba and The Bahamas respectively. As the first African American business owners in Pompano Beach, Frank operated a barbershop and Florence, who was a skilled seamstress, cosmetologist and fashion designer, also operated her business in the building. This two-story property was built in 1933 and placed on the City of Pompano Beach Historical Register in 2016.\n\nThe City of Pompano Beach, Pompano Beach Community Redevelopment Agency and the Rock Road Restoration Historical Group preserve the northwest corridor history and culture by telling positive stories of the African American experience through performing arts, visual arts and intellectual work that educates and celebrates all people of color throughout history.\n\nA Community Redevelopment Agency (CRA) is a dependent district established by City government for the purpose of carrying out redevelopment activities that include reducing or eliminating blight, improving the economic health of an area, and encouraging public and private investments in a CRA district. The CRA is governed by State Statutes, Chapter 163, Part III. The Pompano Beach Community Redevelopment Agency is funded through Tax Increment Financing (TIF). The funds are collected as property values increase and a portion of that increase is captured by the Agency. TIF raises revenue for redevelopment efforts without raising taxes.\n\nComments\n\nTo post a comment, you must register and login."
