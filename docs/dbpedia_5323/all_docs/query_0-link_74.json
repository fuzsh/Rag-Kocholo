        "text": "By Marc Gave | New Pelican Writer\n\nMany longtime television viewers know Esther Rolle as Florida Evans, the no-nonsense housekeeper on the TV show “Maude,” [1972-74] whose character was spun off into the show “Good Times” [1974-79], also starring Jimmie Walker.\n\nBut many viewers may not know that this Emmy-winning actress, who began her life in Pompano Beach, had a much broader career both before and after her television fame.\n\nDance: An Esther Rolle Inspired Exhibition, which opened Oct. 29 and runs through Feb. 9, 2022 at the Ali Cultural Arts Center, 353 Martin Luther King Blvd. in Pompano Beach, is a celebration of the late actress. It plays off the multitalented Rolle’s earlier experiences as a dancer in and director of the Shogola Oloba dance troupe.\n\nLast year, Ali celebrated and honored the centennial birthday of the city’s native daughter in a more general exhibit. Due to the pandemic, the public response was fairly low-key. Works from that show are still hanging among the new ones.\n\nThis year, a nationwide call to artists yielded some 50 entries, out of which 21 artists are represented in the exhibit. The result is a wide-ranging medley of works that stand out individually and at the same time create a satisfying whole. This quality is thanks to the exhibit’s judges, Jemilah Jones of Ashanti Cultural Arts [housed at the Ali Center] and Luctricia Walters of Jubilee Dance Theatre, and to curator Juliana Forero.\n\nForero says, “Last year, we pretty much exhausted the local talent, and the exhibit was borrowing artifacts through the Rock Road Restoration Historical Group from the African American Research Library and Cultural Center in Fort Lauderdale. So we ran the call to artists from March through the middle of August.”\n\nIn addition to many outstanding works, Forero says “wonderful conversations about dance forms in the African diaspora we generated, with anecdotes from such places as Benin, in West Africa.”\n\nThe pieces reflect a range of media and where creators are in their artistic journeys. Paintings abound, from realistic to nonrepresentational. They are joined by small quilted pieces, archival pigment prints, and multimedia works. Above all, works unmistakably depict the movement of dance, whether they depict actual dancers or multiple footprints across a canvas, along with an unmistakable sense of exuberance.\n\nThe exhibit is divided into two floors of the Ali Center, Forero. “First-floor pieces tend to focus on the more-soulful, purely joyful aspects of dance. The second-floor pieces capture a variety of dance forms: ballroom, African dance, even Tropicana.”\n\nBesides the “Dance” exhibit, Forero has curated exhibits at the Pompano Beach Cultural Center and BaCA [Bailey Contemporary Arts]. In addition, she has produced videos for social media on the Pompano Beach pages.\n\nDue to short staffing issues related to the pandemic, those interested in viewing the exhibit should call 954-786-7877."
