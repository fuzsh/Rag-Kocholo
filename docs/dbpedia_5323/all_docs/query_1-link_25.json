        "text": "He symbolized the 70s American dream of success -- the former kid from the ghetto who rose to wisecracking TV superstardom. While in his element as the broadly strutting, gleamy-toothed J.J. Evans of the popular urban-styled sitcom Good Times (1974), Jimmie Walker lived the extremely good life. Following the series' demise, however, reality again checked in. Still and all, he has not self-destructed as others before him have and continues to enjoy a comedy career now approaching four decades.\n\nJimmie was born on June 25, 1947, in New York's tough South Bronx neighborhood. His ambitions were not originally to entertain. Basketball was his prime interest but the idea that a gawky, stringbean-framed teenager could become a hoop star did not seem realistic. Instead he abruptly quit school and worked an odd assortment of jobs until wisely returning to night classes at Theodore Roosevelt High School and redeeming himself with a diploma. The federally-funded Search for Education, Evaluation and Knowledge (SEEK) next came through for Jimmie as he was able to learn a trade: radio engineering/announcing. Within a year he was hired as an engineer for a small radio station, but gained a minor reputation on the sly as a funny guy and good writer. This side interest is what motivated Jimmie to try comedy performance.\n\nHe made his stand-up debut as an opening act on New Year's Eve in 1967 for \"The Last Poets,\" a militant poetry group, and was such a hit that he stayed with the group for a year and a half building and polishing his jive-styled act. At one point Jimmie was seen at a Manhattan club by comedian David Brenner who referred him and others (such as Freddie Prinze) to Budd Friedman and his Improv stage in New York. Jimmie eventually became a regular. His debut shot on TV variety came with Jack Paar's show and his successful 1972 appearance propelled him to main attraction billing.\n\nHe was quickly checked out by the Norman Lear team and practically handed stardom on a silver platter with Good Times (1974), a spin-off of Esther Rolle's domestic character on the popular Maude (1972) series. Skinny, energetic and youthful-looking with plenty of harmless sass and attitude, Jimmie and the show were instant cross-over hits despite the fact that he was a 27-year-old playing the teenage son of Rolle. His catchphrase \"Dyn-o-mite!\" became a popular item in the American vernacular. Jimmie became such a major celebrity that Time Magazine named him \"Comedian of the Decade.\" Clothing, belts, and even a talking doll that blurted out his familiar phrase were soon on the open market. To the dismay of other actors on the show, his exaggerated character stole prime focus and shifted the well-intentioned direction of a positive black family image into a much broader and stereotyped caricature. This caused dissension in the troops and both adult leads, Ms. Rolle and John Amos, departed the series (Rolle came back later). Nevertheless, the series managed to last six seasons.\n\nDuring that time Jimmie made use of his ever-surging popularity with lightweight appearances elsewhere on primetime (\"The Love Boat,\" \"Fantasy Island\") and on game shows (\"The Match Game,\" \"Tattletales\"). He became a hot item in Las Vegas and even churned out a best-selling comedy album entitled, of course, \"Dyn-o-mite!\" His attempt at film stardom came with a top supporting role in Drehn wir noch'n Ding (1975) starring Sidney Poitier and Bill Cosby, a comedy that also featured his TV dad John Amos. Jimmie was featured as a highly unlikely, scrawny-framed boxer promoted by Poitier and Cosby. As enjoyable as he was, it did not lead to other major film offers. Most of his later movies have been self-mocking guest parts or cameo bits in spoofs such as in Die unglaubliche Reise in einem verrückten Flugzeug (1980), the Frankenstein take-off Monster Mash: The Movie (1995) and the slasher movie parody Schrei wenn du weisst, was ich letzten Freitag den 13. getan habe (2000).\n\nUpon the series' demise in 1979, Jimmie returned to the stand-up stage while looking for a sophomore TV hit. Unable to capitalize on his TV stardom, he instead found himself extremely pigeon-holed by the J.J. character. The short-lived B.A.D. Cats (1980), which had him playing a support role as a comic car thief-cum-repossessor, lasted only a month. The military comedy At Ease (1983) had Jimmie starring as a Sergeant Bilko-like conman. It too came and went quickly. Hoping the third time would be a charm, Jimmie was a bust again in the syndicated show Bustin' Loose (1987), based loosely on Richard Pryor's 1981 movie, with the comedian playing another of his genial con artists.\n\nJimmie's main focus has remained the stand-up circuit, touring an average of 25-30 weeks a year. The rubbery-faced, tunnel-mouthed comic continues to pop up occasionally on the late night talk show forum. In his spare time he writes scripts for TV and films.\n\nA native of New Jersey and son of a mechanic, African-American John Amos has relied on his imposing build, eruptive nature and strong, forceful looks to obtain acting jobs, and a serious desire for better roles to earn a satisfying place in the annals of film and TV. He has found it a constant uphill battle to further himself in an industry that tends to diminish an actor's talents with severe and/or demeaning stereotypes and easy pigeonholing. A tough, often hot-headed guy with a somewhat tender side, John would succeed far better on stage than on film and TV...with one extremely noteworthy exceptions.\n\nBorn on December 27, 1939, John was first employed as an advertising copywriter, a social worker at New York's Vera Institute of Justice, and an American and Canadian semi-professional football player before receiving his calling as an actor. A stand-up comic on the Greenwich Village circuit, the work eventually took him West and, ultimately, led to his hiring as a staff writer on Leslie Uggams' musical variety show in 1969. Making his legit stage debut in a 1971 L.A. production of the comedy \"Norman, Is That You?\", John went on to earn a Los Angeles Drama Critics nomination for \"Best Actor\". As such, he formed his own theater company and produced \"Norman, Is That You?\" on tour.\n\nThe following year he returned to New York to take his first Broadway bow in \"Tough To Get Help\". By this time he had secured secondary work on the classic Oh Mary (1970) as Gordy the weatherman. His character remained on the periphery, however, and he left the show after three discouraging seasons. On the bright side, he won the recurring role of the sporadically-unemployed husband of maid Florida Evans (played by Esther Rolle) on Norman Lear's Maude (1972) starring Bea Arthur. The two characters were spun-off into their own popular series as the parental leads in Good Times (1974).\n\nGood Times (1974), a family sitcom that took place in a Chicago ghetto high-rise, initially prided itself as being the first network series ever to be created by African-Americans. But subsequent episodes were taken over by others and John was increasingly disgruntled by the lack of quality of the scripts and the direction Lear was taking the show. Once focused on the importance of family values, it was shifting more and more toward the silly antics of Jimmie 'JJ' Walker, who was becoming a runaway hit on the show as the aimless, egotistical, jive-talking teenage son JJ. John began frequently clashing with the higher-ups and, by 1976, was released from the series, with his character being killed in an off-camera car accident while finding employment out of state.\n\nAmos rebounded quickly when he won the Emmy-nominated role of the adult Kunte Kinte in the ground-breaking epic mini-series Roots: The Complete Miniseries (1977), one of the most powerful and reverential TV features ever to hit television. It was THE TV role of his career, but he found other quality roles for other black actors extremely difficult to come by. He tried his best to avoid the dim-headed lugs and crime-motivated characters that came his way. Along with a few parts (the mini-movie Willa (1979) and the films Beastmaster - Der Befreier (1982) and Der Prinz aus Zamunda (1988)), he had to endure the mediocre (guest spots on Love Boat (1977), \"The A-Team\", \"Murder, She Wrote\" \"One Life to Live\"). John also toiled through a number of action-themed films that focused more on grit and testosterone than talent.\n\nHe found one answer to this acting dilemma on the proscenium stage. In 1985, the play \"Split Second\" earned him the NAACP Award as Best Actor. He also received fine reviews in a Berkshire Theater festival production of \"The Boys Next Door\", a tour of O'Neill's towering play \"The Emperor Jones\", and in a Detroit production of Athol Fugard's \"Master Harold...and The Boys\". In addition, John directed two well-received productions, \"Miss Reardon Drinks a Little\" and \"Twelve Angry Men\", in the Bahamas. He took on Shakespeare as Sir Toby Belch in \"Twelfth Night\" at Joseph Papp's New York Shakespeare and earned strong notices in the late August Wilson's Pulitzer Prize-winning play \"Fences\" at the Capital Repertory Company in Albany, New York. Overseas he received plaudits for his appearance in a heralded production of \"The Life and Death of a Buffalo Soldier\" at the Bristol's Old Vic in England. Capping his theatrical career was the 1990 inaugural of his one-man show \"Halley's Comet\", an amusing and humanistic American journey into the life of an 87-year-old who recalls, among other things, World War II, the golden age of radio, the early civil rights movement, and the sighting of the Comet when he was 11. He wrote and has frequently directed the show, which continues to play into the 2007-2008 season.\n\nIn recent years, John has enjoyed recurring parts on \"The West Wing\" and \"The District\", and is more recently appearing in the offbeat series Men in Trees (2006) starring Anne Heche. John Amos has two children by his former wife Noel Amos and two children. Son K.C. Amos director, writer, producer, editor and daughter Shannon Amos a director, writer and producer. Amos has one grand child,a grand-daughter, Quiera Williams.\n\nBest known for the role of Florida Evans on the 1970s sitcoms Maude (1972) and Good Times (1974), African-American actress Esther Rolle proved to be as spirited and iron-willed off-camera as well. The gap-toothed actress with the gravelly voice was born in Pompano Beach, Florida, the 10th child of 18 born to Caribbean farming immigrants. Her first important work came with the Negro Ensemble Company and over the years would earn a solid careworn reputation in such theater plays as \"The Blacks\", \"Blues for Mister Charlie\", \"The Amen Corner\", \"A Raisin in the Sun\" and \"A Member of the Wedding\". Ironically, her father insisted she promise him that she would never become a servant or maid in real life. She didn't, and however Esther would have her biggest successes playing just those types of roles. She caught the attention of television producer Norman Lear while performing on stage who cast her in the Maude (1972) supporting role in 1972. Audiences loved her so much as the feisty domestic who stood her ground, and then some, against her volatile and liberal-minded employer Maude Findley (Bea Arthur), that Esther earned her own spin-off series with Good Times (1974). Compelled to fight racial stereotypes, she insisted before accepting the series that a strong father figure be central in the show (actor John Amos). And while she still played the role of a lower middle-class maid, the show's emphasis was to be on her home and family life, not her outside work. Still, Esther left the show for one season when she was unhappy about the negative role model perpetuated by Jimmie 'JJ' Walker's jive-talking character J.J., but later returned after the producers assured her that more responsibility would be taken. In other assignments, she won an Emmy Award for the television movie Mein deutscher Soldat (1978) and gained further respect for her work in Maya Angelou's I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings (1979) and for her film work in Miss Daisy und ihr Chauffeur (1989) and Rosewood Burning (1997). Two of her sisters, Estelle Evans and Rosanna Carter, were also character actresses. Afflicted with diabetes, Esther's health failed in the 1990s and toward the end of her life she was on kidney dialysis. The actress, who was divorced and had no children, died nine days after her 78th birthday on November 17, 1998.\n\nHe was a master class in cerebral eloquence and audience command...and although his dominant playing card in the realm of acting was quite serious and stately, nobody cut a more delightfully dry edge in sitcoms than this gentleman, whose calm yet blistering put-downs often eluded his lesser victims.\n\nActing titan Roscoe Lee Browne was born to a Baptist minister and his wife on May 2, 1922, in Woodbury, New Jersey. He attended Lincoln University, an historically black university in Pennsylvania until 1942, when he enlisted in the U.S. Army during World War II, where he served in Italy with the Negro 92nd Infantry Division and organized the Division's track and field team. He graduated from Lincoln University in 1946, and studied French through Middlebury College's summer language program. He received his master's degree from Columbia University, then subsequently returned to Lincoln and taught French and comparative literature, seemingly destined to settle in completely until he heard a different calling.\n\nRoscoe relished his first taste of adulation and admiration as a track star, competing internationally and winning the world championship in the 800-yard dash in 1951. He parlayed that attention into a job as a sales representative for a wine and liquor importer. In 1956, he abruptly decided to become an actor. And he did. With no training but a shrewd, innate sense of self, he boldly auditioned for, and won, the role of the Soothsayer in \"Julius Caesar\" the very next day at the newly-formed New York Shakespeare Festival. He never looked back and went on to perform with the company in productions of \"The Taming of the Shrew\", \"Titus Andronicus\", \"Othello\", \"King Lear\" (as the Fool), and \"Troilus and Cressida\".\n\nBlessed with rich, mellifluous tones and an imposing, cultured air, Roscoe became a rare African-American fixture on the traditionally white classical stage. In 1961 he appeared notably with James Earl Jones in the original off-Broadway cast of Jean Genet's landmark play \"The Blacks\". Awards soon came his way -- the first in the form of an Obie only a few years later for his portrayal of a rebellious slave in \"The Old Glory\". Additionally, he received the Los Angeles Drama Critic's Circle Award for both \"The Dream on Monkey Mountain\" (1970) and \"Joe Turner's Come and Gone\" (1989). Roscoe found less successful ventures on 1960s Broadway, taking his first curtain call in \"A Cool World\" in 1960, which folded the next day. He graced a number of other short runs including \"General Seegar\" (1962), \"Tiger, Tiger Burning Bright\" (1962), \"The Ballad of the Sade Cafe\" (1964), \"Danton's Death\" (1965), and \"A Hand Is on the Gate: An Evening of Negro Poetry and Folk Music\" (1966), which he also wrote and directed. He did not return to Broadway until 1983 with the role of the singing Rev. J.D. Montgomery in Tommy Tune's smash musical \"My One and Only\" in which his number \"Kicking the Clouds Away\" proved to be one of many highlights. Roscoe returned only once more to Broadway, earning acclaim and a Tony nomination for his supporting performance in August Wilson's \"Two Trains Running\" (1992).\n\nAlthough he made an isolated debut with The Connection (1961), he wouldn't appear regularly in films until the end of the decade with prominent parts in the Elizabeth Taylor/Richard Burton film, Die Stunde der Komödianten (1967), Jules Dassin's Black Power (1968), Hitchcock's Topas (1969) and, his most notable, Die Glut der Gewalt (1970). Thereafter, he complimented a host of features, both comedic and dramatic, including Superfly (1972) (and its sequel), Samstagnacht oben in der Stadt (1974), Flucht ins 23. Jahrhundert (1976), Staatsanwälte küsst man nicht (1986), Mambo Kings (1992) and Hilfe, ich komm' in den Himmel (1996)\n\nElsewhere, Roscoe's disdainful demeanor courted applause on all the top 70s sitcoms including \"All in the Family\", \"Maude,\" \"Sanford and Son\", \"Good Times\" and \"Barney Miller\" (Emmy-nominated), and he played the splendidly sardonic role of Saunders, the Tate household butler, after replacing Robert Guillaume's popular \"Benson\" character on Die Ausgeflippten (1977). In 1986 he won an Emmy Award for his guest appearance on Die Bill Cosby Show (1984). His trademark baritone lent authority and distinction to a number of documentaries, live-action fare, and animated films, as well as the spoken-word arena, with such symphony orchestras as the Boston Pops and the Los Angeles Philharmonic to his credit. A preeminent recitalist, he was known for committing hundreds of poems to memory. For many years he and actor Anthony Zerbe toured the U.S. with their presentation of \"Behind the Broken Words\", an evening of poetry and dramatic readings.\n\nAt the time of his death of cancer on April 11, 2007, the never-married octogenarian was still omnipresent, more heard than seen perhaps. Among his last works was his narrations of a Garfield film feature and the most recent movie spoof Fantastic Movie (2007).\n\nPhilip Michael Thomas - the multi-talented performer best known as Detective Rico Tubbs in the iconic 1980s TV series Miami Vice (1984) - made his Broadway debut in 1971 in the Pulitzer Prize-winning play No Place to Be Somebody...and hasn't looked back since.\n\nIn a remarkable career that spans nearly four decades, PMT has worked with some of the top stage, screen, and recording personalities in the world.\n\nHe first guest starred on TV in 1973 in the pilot for the series Pilot (1973), followed by parts in Good Times (1974), Make-Up und Pistolen (1974), Medical Center (1969), Wonder Woman (1978)_, _Starsky and Hutch (1978)_, and Trapper John, M.D. (1979) before landing the role on Miami Vice (1984) in 1984 that made him a household name - and took him on a whirlwind tour of the globe and into the presence of heads of state (including President Ronald Reagan and Nelson Mandela), fellow celebrities, and countless adoring fans.\n\nDespite world-wide stardom as an actor of both stage and screen, it is music that is PMT's biggest passion. He wrote his first song at the age of 11 and, over the next 40 years, wrote, composed, and sung everything from Gospel to R&B to pop standards to rock. One long-time friend recently referred to the musical side of PMT as \"an undiscovered diamond.\"\n\nDuring the stratospheric years of Miami Vice (1984-1989), PMT released two highly regarded albums: Livin' the Book of My Life (1985) and Somebody (1988), both on his own Starship Records label, with distribution by industry giant Atlantic Records. Although much loved by fans to this day, his albums didn't sell as well as expected (perhaps due to a wide range of musical styles that defied pigeonhole) and remain out of print, although they often fetch a tidy sum on eBay. PMT is considering reissuing his solo albums with bonus tracks sometime in 2007 or 2008.\n\nThe power of imagination and love to overcome circumstances is a theme that runs through the fabric of his life. He cites singing \"The Impossible Dream\" (from Man of La Mancha) while at Oakwood College in 1967 as a turning point for him.\n\nConsidered by long-time friends and family members alike to be one of the most compassionate, spiritual, and generous men they've ever known, PMT credits his uplifting, positive outlook on life to a vegetarian diet, regular exercise, life-long learning, friends he's made through the years, and books such as The Holy Bible, Napoleon Hill's Think and Grow Rich, and Paramahansa Yogananda's Autobiography of a Yogi, among many others.\n\nPMT loves Florida and has chosen to make his home there instead of L.A. or New York as do most of his colleagues. Naturally, this keeps him out of the limelight, but it's a mistake to assume that just because his name isn't regularly splashed across the tabloids that he's not keeping himself busy. In fact, he is working (2007) on his autobiography, his official web site, reading scripts, performing, writing music, and helping young performers reach the heights he has reached - and doing it all with characteristic charm, grace, vitality...and with his trademark banner, \"Treasure beyond measure!\" flying proudly overhead."
