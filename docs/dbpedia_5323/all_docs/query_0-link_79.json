        "text": "Esther Rolle, who went from feisty maid in the hit sitcom Maude to strong-willed matriarch in the spinoff Good Times, has died at age 78.\n\nMs. Rolle died Tuesday at a hospital in Culver City, her spokesman Larry Calhoun said. The cause of death was not determined, but she had diabetes and was undergoing dialysis, he said.\n\nAn actor who fought black stereotypes in Hollywood, Ms. Rolle ironically spent much of her career playing maids, on producer Norman Lear's Maude and Good Times and in the TV movie Summer of My German Soldier, which won her an Emmy in 1979.\n\nOn stage, she played a retired maid in the classic A Raisin in the Sun. She also appeared on the big screen in Driving Miss Daisy, again as a housekeeper; and in John Singleton's tragic Rosewood. She has a role in poet Maya Angelou's directorial debut film, Down in the Delta, due out next month.\n\nLear, creator of Good Times, said he cast Ms. Rolle because of her strong presence.\n\n\"Wherever she was, you knew she was there,\" he said. \"The woman had strong conviction. We may not have agreed on everything, but that is what happens when you have two creative minds at work.\"\n\nGood Times, which ran from 1974 to 1979, told the story of a struggling but loving family on Chicago's South Side.\n\nMs. Rolle's character, Florida Evans, was still a maid, but the emphasis was on her home life with her husband, two sons and daughter. It made a star out of Jimmie Walker, who played the older son J.J., and his trademark saying, \"Dy-no-mite!,\" became a national catch phrase.\n\nShe told The Associated Press in 1987 that she was intent on shattering the image of a \"Hollywood maid with the rolling of the eyes\" who doted on her white charges but ignored her own children. Being a maid, she said, was a reality for black Americans.\n\nWhen CBS was planning a Maude spinoff series in which she played a single mother, Ms. Rolle demanded that her family be led by a father. That part went to John Amos, who was introduced on Maude the year before Good Times began.\n\n\"I told them I couldn't compound the lie that black fathers don't care about their children,\" she said. \"I was proud of the family life I was able to introduce to television.\"\n\nAgain striving for good role models, Ms. Rolle left Good Times after three seasons because she felt the J.J. character, who began getting mixed up in shady schemes as the show evolved, was a poor example for black youth. She was persuaded to return after a year.\n\nMs. Rolle was born in Pompano Beach, the 10th of 18 children. Her father was a vegetable farmer. Her manager gave her date of birth as Nov. 8, 1920, though some references list the year as 1922.\n\nHer older siblings wrote skits that she performed for the younger children. After high school, she followed her actor sister to New York City and eventually landed Broadway parts.\n\nIn 1990, she became the first woman to receive the NAACP Chairman's Civil Rights Leadership Award, which honored her work in helping raise the image of blacks.\n\nShe is survived by two sisters and a brother."
