        "text": "Well, he's blunt:\n\n- He, Esther Rolle and John Amos never spoke except in character. He doesn't like Amos at all.\n\n- He mocks Ja'Net DuBois for her wardrobe obsession and constant pushing to do more on the show.\n\n- He says Ralph Carter \"gave up\" and phoned it in sometime in the middle of the series.\n\n- As for Janet Jackson, he never once talked to her on the set: \"I don't speak to kids. I have nothing to say to kids.\"\n\nMy favorite part is when he mentions seeing these people at autograph shows — \"because that's what we're reduced to these days, autograph shows.\"\n\nThere's nothing unusual about what he said. He doesn't say he, Rolle and Amos only spoke when in character. He said the only time they spoke was when they were on the set and never outside of work. Big deal. That's the way it is with most people who work with each other. There's no fucking way actors working that closely could not have spoken to each other during their work hours outside of the times they were performing. Anyone who has ever had a job of any type can look back and say that they never spoke to the vast majority of the people they've worked with outside of work hours, did not have their home or cell phone numbers, and didn't even know where they lived.\n\nAnd as for his relationship with the others, there have been more sets that could be counted where actors had no desire for any sort of relationship outside of work for various reasons. At times it's because they honestly don't like each other, or their private lives and/or personalities simply go in very different directions.\n\nIt's obvious he's just talking about how so many viewers automatically assume that all actors who work together and appear to like each other on the show or in movies must automatically be very close personal friends. And that's because a large percentage of the viewing public are cretins.\n\nAmos and Rilke didn’t like him. Why should he like them back? Walkers schtick wore thin sometimes, but he brought some much needed levity to the show about a family living in the ghetto. One of the writers has said Walker clearly didn’t respect Amos and Rolle and they deserved it. I wouldn’t be so open to respect if my fellow actors wouldn’t give me the time of day off set.\n\nThe show DID tackle a lot of important social issues for blacks and was very much of its time. On Family Ties Michael Gross and Meredith Baxter were smart enough just shut up and continue working when it became the Michael J Fox show. Not the biggest fan of Walker but he should get some slack. The character was a buffoon but was popular. The writers just wrote to that. There were other characters on the show who gave it balance.\n\nI thought that was awful about him trying to pimp out Bernnadette Stanis for a pin-up poster. He still doesn’t get it all these years later. As if there needed to be another reason to think he’s an odious toad.\n\nIt’s telling that none of the other cast members liked him.\n\nAlthough Esther Rolle notoriously had no sense of humor whatsoever. How and why she worked as a comedic actress is beyond me. Bea Arthur didn’t really think much of her either.\n\nThis happens all the time. The audience takes a liking to a supporting player and the supporting player becomes THE show and the main leads resent the supporting player for it. And in most cases it's nothing that the supporting player has done, other than read a bit of dialogue or do a bit of business that clicks with the audience.\n\nI watched the interview and found him charming. He probably inflated his contributions a little bit in some places, but a lot of stuff gets jumbled with time. He was right about that calendar.\n\nWow. Does Walker have anything good to say about anyone at all on the show?\n\nJohn Amos was only seven years older than Walker, who played his son. Rolle was 19 years older than Amos.\n\nA few years ago, I saw another interview with Walker, where he was much more blunt. I got the feeling that, when they weren't in front of the camera, Walker would rather spend time in his dressing room than interact with his costars.\n\nMaybe 20 years ago, there was a \"Behind the Music\" type show about Good Times. During her talking head segment, Janet DuBois gave her take on the conflict about the JJ character becoming so prominent on the show. She said that it was a cultural issue, that \"in the black community, the father does not rise above the son.\"\n\nEsther Rolle left the show because the JJ character was too obnoxious. She told the producers she'd return only if the JJ character matured. In Rolle's absence, the writers did make the JJ character more responsible, so she came back for the final season.\n\n[quote]Esther Rolle left the show because the JJ character was too obnoxious.\n\nShe was very specific before the show even started that she wanted to show the black family as a whole family (including the family). There also had to be a religious implication to it (that's why the Jesus picture on the wall).\n\nI think she was at odds even before the show started because I think Norman Lear wanted it to be a poor black family in the projects and she wanted to be the black Maude.\n\n\"David Letterman is the most loyal person in show business.\n\nAnd I know for a fact that he has ended up taking care of(financially) several of the people wo gave him a hand up when he was starting out when they run into financial difficulties. I am not saying that Jimmie has difficulties, I am only stating that Dave never ever left him behind once HE became the bigger star.\"\n\nThis would explain why the unfunniest comedian ever, George Miller, was on his show so often. The crowd never laughed at any of his jokes and George always looked very uncomfortable doing his routine.\n\nR84 learn to read bitch. From my first post I said I’m not the biggest Walker fan. He can be asshole for sure. The show would not have been as popular without him. This is a fact. Sure his character was an idiot, but not totally unfunny. That’s what the public liked. It was what it was. The show would’ve benefited more from an all black writers. However CBS laughed all the way to the bank with Walker on the show. All true.\n\nYes. That is correct R92. Any comic who had given Dave a job writing when he was a starving Comedy Store newbie in the 70s was always booked 2-3 times per year regardless of their popularity or performance. It was not a matter of giving them a little money, it was so they could use \"straight from Late Night with David Letterman\" or \"From The Late Show with David Letterman\" when promoting gigs around the country.\n\nHis friendship with the great John Witherspoon is legion. \"Spoon\" named his first son after Dave.\n\nThere may not be an odder duck than DL in all of show biz, and many people mistake his weirdness for arrogance or misanthropy, but he is has held on to his midwestern values all these years, and he is one of a kind.\n\nI don't understand his criticism of Ralph Carter. First of all, Ralph was a kid who went through adolescence over the course of the show. (Walker, on the other hand, was 27 and playing a 16-year-old.) Throughout the series, I don't remember any point where Ralph appeared to be \"phoning it in\". He was given less to do as the focus on Walker increased. And after the James character was gone, there went the major source of conflict for the Michael character.\n\nHe doesn't have a single good thing to say about anyone. A few years back when most of the cast reunited at some autograph-signing events, lots of autograph seekers posted videos of youtube. The other cast members all seemed to get along well, and they were trying to be inclusive towards Walker, but he seemed standoffish. He's a difficult person. He might have some personality disorder.\n\nAny criticism against Ralph Carter is harsh. As stated above, he was just a kid when the show started and he actually did a good job. Part of the problem was that they made him the mouthpiece for all things black and his babbling of black unemployment stats was what killed his character. He's the only character on the show that could have been removed and nobody would have missed him. And that's not his fault because his character was poorly written.\n\nI imagine Jimmy Walker is bitter because his career didn't turn out better. When you look at Sherman Helmsley and Isabelle Sanford being swept off All In the Family and into their own very successful show AND then Marla Gibbs being swept off to her own show (yes, her sitcom was crap because of the writing not because she wasn't funny). When you look at Bea Arthur making, what two appearances on All In The Family and getting her own show. When you see Penny Marshall and Cindy Williams doing one appearance on Happy Days and then getting their own show. And then to top it off, on his very own show, Janet Jackson and Gary Coleman going on to be hugely popular after the show. All of that has to make a person slightly bitter.\n\nIf he bought that house in Lloyd Harbor when Good Times was running, I bet it was paid off long ago. We used to smoke pot at the end of his private road back when we were in high school. Sandy beach. Great view. The house is on a massive lot with at least 500 ft. of frontage. It was only recently I read he lived there. And now I can't remember where. Also I have no idea if he still owns it. But if he does . . . definitely a good investment.\n\n[quote]They did what they were supposed to do, didn't derail the shows they were on, and weren't braying jackasses who played to the lowest common denominator in order to steal the most attention in every scene.\n\nJimmy Walker did what he was supposed to do. If the producers didn't want that, they could have sent JJ away to live with Aunt Frieda in Harlem and he would have made weekly phone calls like Suzanne Somers had to do when she got out of her place. I don't blame Jimmy Walker. It must have also been difficult because when John and Esther left the show, his character had to prop up the show. Willona could only run in and out of their apartment making wisecracks so many times before it became unrealistic. Why was old Willona hanging around with a bunch of teenagers? When Florida left, that left nothing for Willona to do. So the JJ character had to step up and continue the show.\n\nWhen you think about it, it's interesting that when Esther left, top billing went to Ja'Net. They could have easily rearranged the billing to put Jimmy, who became head of the Evans household, in first position and perhaps given Ja'Net the \"and\" placement at the end. And when Esther returned and went back into first position with Jimmy in second, she could have kept her special placement at the end. But then, with Florida away, Willona essentially became the only mature adult and, in the producers' eyes, the de facto star of the show. (It's hard to imagine that that set well with Jimmy either.)\n\nI'll never forget how much my father hated \"Good Times.\" He worked two jobs at the time to support us and said that the last thing he wanted to do when he got home was watch a show about another black family struggling through hard times. (Like James Evans, he passed when we were young; I was 10 when we lost him.)\n\nThe blame rests squarely with Jimmie Walker and his narcissistic stand-up comic impulses. There's always one guy in every group who will show is ass for a cheap laugh, and the one one Good Times instigated major negatives changes. The producers smelled another Fonzie Mania and didn't rein him back, as they should have. The result was just as embarrassing as it was on Happy Days, both for the cast, and for the mindless audience members who fueled such childish and simplistic presentations.\n\nEveryone should have known better, not just John and Esther.\n\nI didn't considerer Thelma's husband Keith \"fine ass.\" I thought he looked pretty goofy.\n\nI thought \"Good Times\" had an ending that was such a crock. After all the years of \"scratching and SUR-viving\" they all end up nicely off. Keith (who had previously suffered what looked like a career ending knee injury) is back being a football player, and he and the pregnant Thelma move to an expensive apartment, taking Florida with them. Willona gets promoted to \"head buyer\" at the never seen boutique where she works, so she and her rotten little adopted daughter Penny (she wants to be a STAR) can move to an expensive apartment. J.J. creates a comic book character called \"Dy-no-woman\" and sells it to a publisher and he goes on to get an expensive bachelor \"pad.\" Michael is in college, presumably on a scholarship, and is getting his own nice place off campus. As fate would have it ,it turns out the building Keith and Thelma and Florida they're moving into is the exact same one Wilona and Penny will also live in and is right upstairs from Willona's! The show ends as \"Florida & Wilona laugh and cheer at this wonderful news and end the series with a hug.\" Oh PUKE. It would have been so much more meaningful and interesting if the last show had the characters still dealing with hardships but still determined to make better lives for themselves. Instead it turned out to be pure sap.\n\nR138 it was written at the time that the ending was a sort of gift to the viewers who had stuck with the show and were rooting for the characters.\n\nTo do otherwise would have been more realistic, but it would have been too depressing and certainly unrewarding for the majority of fans who cared about whether or not the characters would be okay.\n\n\"To do otherwise would have been more realistic, but it would have been too depressing and certainly unrewarding for the majority of fans who cared about whether or not the characters would be okay.\"\n\ni thought the ending sold out. That was a major theme of \"Good Times\", this family trying to do the best they can in trying circumstances. To wrap everything up in a \"happily ever after\" package trivialized it. I remember one scene when John Amos was still on the show. He and Florida were talking about their situation and she says something like \"I don't know how we're gonna make it.\" And James says \"same as we always do...somehow.\" I thought the show should have ended on that same kind of note.\n\nWell, they didn't have much depth , r147 . Otherwise they never would have elevated Jimmie's jackassery over Esther and John's dedication to quality.\n\nIf they did have the sort of depth you are referring to, it seems likely that the show would have stayed the course desired by John and Esther, and we would be talking about a qualitatively very different, and perhaps even longer-running, show today.\n\nBut that didn't happen. We got Fonzied.\n\nAdding Janet Jackson to the cast was surely a shark jumping moment. And Wilona, who had previously had no interest whatsoever in being a single parent, decides she simply MUST adopt her. It just didn't make any sense. I guess it was a desperate attempt to keep people interested in the show by adding a \"cute\" child character. But she wasn't that cute. And she had this cringeworthy crush on J.J. She even wants to sleep in the same bed with him! Ew, gross!\n\nYeah, I wasn't going to comment on the poster above who complained that GT didn't do their research because the super wouldn't have had any power and the project would have never taken a single, childless woman...\n\nWhen you write a sitcom (or a short story or a novel), you have to have a variety of characters in a variety of situations--especially in a sitcom that could easily run for years--or you will run out of material. Sometimes you have to combine real life characters into one character to make the story easier to comprehend. Bookman is not actually meant to be a super: he's meant to show what it's like to have a person have authority over someone's housing (which is a government function).\n\nIt's true to life, but not in a documentary-style.\n\nThat's all.\n\nWithout Jimmie Walker there would've been no show.\n\nSo all those complaints Amos and Rolle have are negated by the fact, without him, they wouldn't have had anything to complain about.\n\nAs it was \"Happy Days\" slaughtered it in the ratings with Walker, it barely hung on.\n\nEsther Rolle and John Amos are equivalent to the guy who wins a million dollars and then bitches about paying taxes on it.\n\nR170 many shows have started out as one way on paper, get on air and it's discovered that what looked good on paper isn't translating to the screen. Then, to keep the show on air, they write to what is working and what is sparking with the audience. In this case it happened to be Jimmie Walker. I don't think he set out to steal the show, the audience just responded to him and it drove ratings so the writers put a larger focus on JJ. Sometimes things don't go as planned.\n\nThis is very similar to what happened on Cybill with Christine Baranski and in both cases the leads of the show got upset with their co-stars when it really wasn't the co-stars fault.\n\nAnd in both cases it altered the balance of the show for the worse.\n\nNobody asked for it to become the Christine Baranski Show. I mean, she was great, and a necessary component for the show, but FUCK. Too much is enough, already.\n\nI understand the theory behind what you say. But the reality is that there is going with what works, and then there's pandering to the simpleton masses for a fast and dirty buck. It happened to a lesser degree on Cybill, and to a much stronger degree on Good Times. It wasn't as if Good Times was in danger of cancellation when the decision was made to allow Jimmie to run amok. People were just in a pandering frame of mind.\n\nThe adoption or appearance of a kid out of no where was standard for family sitcoms late in their run in the 70's and 80's. I haven't seen any of the episodes for a long time, but I think Janet was fairly unobnoxious compared to other late sitcom additions.\n\nThe one that was particularly odd was Vicky on the Love Boat. It was not a family sitcom to begin with, and it was odd to have a young girl on a boat filled with adults and no other kids in adult situations acting like she was a junior cruise director.\n\nI hated Bookman.\n\nI can understand why Rolle and Amos were upset. The show evolved into something other than what the producers promised Rolle. (R119, thanks for that Joan Rivers talk show clip!) Yes, the producers were making the character too buffoonish. But...it's normal for teenaged sons to posture. Without JJ's shenanigans, would the show still have been a comedy? A show constantly throws things against the wall, and if something sticks, it's only natural that they would want to leverage it. When a character's catchphrase becomes well known, ratings increase, and sponsors can be charged more money. Even as the JJ character's star rose, the parents were still the leaders of the family and thus played substantial roles in the episodes.\n\nI do wonder if the network considered an alternate solution: Give the JJ character a spinoff show that depicts him as a cool but struggling artist. With him gone, that would have resolved the tension on the Good Times set. However, after that, neither show would have worked. The JJ character worked best within a family dynamic, annoying his angry father. To me, the JJ character lost most of his spark when James was no longer there to be triggered by him.\n\n\"Jesus, sitcoms often don't \"make sense.\"\n\nThis one seemed to be intent on portraying the realism of an African American family living in the ghetto, trying to get by. But then it started veering off into crazy directions and losing touch with reality. Wilona wanting to adopt a child all of a sudden without warning. Keith's miraculous recovery from a severe knee injury, seemingly without any extensive rehab. The mysterious demise of Florida's first husband. The ridiculous happy ending. You'd expect a sitcom like \"Gilligan's Island\" not to make sense, but \"Good Times\" should have aimed higher than that.\n\n[quote]Florida's husband is never mentioned once she comes back.\n\nThat was Esther's doing. She wasn't a fan of that whole story arc tp begin with, as she didn't think Florida would go off and get married so soon. When they asked her to come back, one of the conditions was that they give a brief explanation as to where she had been, and then never mention it again.\n\n\"Penny was an abused little girl who clung to JJ because she saw in him a safe haven from her loony mother. There was nothing self-absorbed or materialistic about her.\"\n\nShe didn't mind accepting the lavish gifts that her erstwhile mother bestowed upon her. And Wilona took another job in order to afford the dance lessons (or some kind of show business lessons) her little precious wanted. Little Precious wanted to be a famous STAR! And I never saw anything that suggested she \"clung\" to J. J. to escape her mother. She always wanted him as a boyfriend, a lover, not as a \"safe haven.\"\n\nAs I recall Penny went from being with her abusive mother to the loving arms of Wilona in no time flat. She shows up at the Evan's apartment and tells Wilona \"I'd love to stay with you!\" and badda bing, badda boom, instant Mommy and Baby Girl! It really happened that fast. Her becoming part of the show came out of nowhere, like all these unneeded kid characters tended to. She dropped into Wilona's lap the same way Little Steffi dropped into the laps of Edith and Archie Bunker. And these child characters always signaled the decline of whatever show they were on. They were a total drag.\n\n\"When JJ was about to leave to go on a date or something like that, she grabbed him and said “Please don’t go!”\n\nShe didn't want him to go out on dates because she wanted him as a boyfriend all to herself. I never got the impression her interest in J.J. had anything at all to do with her mother. Once she got mad at him and said if he didn't do something (I can't remember what it was) \"we're through!\" As if they were lovers. I guess in her mind they were.\n\n[quote]Wasn't \"Mork\" similarly introduced on Happy Days too?\n\nYes, \"Mork & Mindy\" was essentially a spin-off of \"Happy Days.\"\n\nI think it's interesting to note that \"Good Times\" was essentially the grandchild of \"All in the Family\" given that it was a spinoff of \"Maude,\" which was a spinoff of \"Family.\" But once \"Good Times\" was created, all connections to \"Maude\" were completely eliminated as Florida's former employers the Findlays were never referred to, not even once. (\"Maude\" was also set in upstate New York whereas \"Good Times\" was set in Chicago.)"
