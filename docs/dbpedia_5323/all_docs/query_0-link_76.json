Rolle is best known for her role as Florida Evans, on the CBS television sitcom Maude, for two seasons (1972–1974), and its spin-off series Good Times, for five seasons (1974–77, 1978–79), for which Rolle was nominated for a Golden Globe Award for Best Actress - Television Series Musical or Comedy in 1976.\n\nContents\n\nyou got the life 1975 esther rolle\n\nwhat if 1975 esther rolle\n\nEarly life\n\nDance and theater\n\nTelevision\n\nMusic and film\n\nPersonal life\n\nStage work\n\nFilmography\n\nReferences\n\nwhat if 1975 esther rolle\n\nEarly life\n\nEsther Rolle was born in Pompano Beach, Florida, to Bahamian immigrants Jonathan Rolle (1883–1953), a farmer, and Elizabeth Iris Rolle (née Dames; 1893–1981). Her parents were both born and raised in Nassau, New Providence, The Bahamas and moved to Florida some time after their marriage. She was the tenth of 18 children (children who included siblings and fellow actresses Estelle Evans and Rosanna Carter). Rolle graduated from Blanche Ely High School in Pompano Beach, Florida. She initially studied at Spelman College in Atlanta, before moving to New York City. While in New York, she attended Hunter College before transferring to The New School and then Yale University in New Haven, Connecticut. For many years, Rolle worked in a traditional day job in New York City's garment district.\n\nDance and theater\n\nRolle was a member of Asadata Dafora's dance troupe, Shogolo Oloba (later renamed the Federal Theater African Dance Troupe). She became the troupe’s director in 1960. Rolle's earliest roles were on the stage; her New York stage debut was in the 1962 play The Blacks. She was often cast in plays produced by Robert Hooks and the Negro Ensemble Company. She also appeared in productions of The Crucible and Blues for Mr. Charlie. Rolle's most prominent early role was as Miss Maybell in the 1973 Melvin Van Peebles play, Don't Play Us Cheap. In 1977, Rolle portrayed Lady Macbeth in Orson Welles' Haitian-influenced version at the Henry Street New Federal Theater in Manhattan.\n\nTelevision\n\nRolle is best known for her television role as Florida Evans, the character she played on two 1970s sitcoms. The character was introduced as Maude Findlay's housekeeper on Maude, and was spun off in the show's second season into Good Times, a show about Florida's family. Rolle was nominated in 1975 for the Best Actress in a Musical/Comedy Golden Globe Award for her role in Good Times. Rolle was 19 years older than the actor (John Amos) who played her husband James Evans. The James Evans character was only added after Esther Rolle fought hard for a father figure and husband to be added to the show. Rolle had fought for the father character on the show, more relevant themes and scripts and was unhappy when the success of Jimmie Walker's character, J.J. Evans, took the show in a frivolous direction. John Amos agreed with Rolle about Walker's character and was fired from the show after the third season ended. Later on, in a stand-off with Good Times producer Norman Lear, Rolle also quit when her contract ended. Although the show continued without her for the fifth season, she returned for the show's final season. In 1979 she won an Emmy for her role in Summer of My German Soldier, a made-for-television movie.\n\nAmong her guest star roles was one on The Incredible Hulk in an episode entitled \"Behind the Wheel\" where she played a taxicab business owner. In the 1990s, Rolle was a surprise guest on RuPaul's VH-1 talk show. Her Maude co-star Bea Arthur was the guest, and Rolle was brought out to surprise Arthur. The two had not seen each other in years, Arthur said, and embraced warmly. Rolle also appeared in a series of psychic hotline TV commercials in the 1990s. \"Tell them Esther sent you,\" was her trademark line.\n\nMusic and film\n\nRolle released an album of music titled The Garden of My Mind in 1975. Rolle's first screen appearance is a small, uncredited role in To Kill a Mockingbird (1962), and she later appeared in Gordon Parks' The Learning Tree (1969). Her sister, actress Estelle Evans, appeared in both films as well. Esther Rolle appeared early in her career in the film, Nothing But a Man (1964). After Good Times ended, she appeared in a number of made-for-television movies and films, including Driving Miss Daisy and My Fellow Americans. A memorable role was that of Aunt Sarah in the film Rosewood (1997). She had a major role in I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings based on Maya Angelou's memoir of the same name, and has the distinction of having won the first Emmy Award for the category Outstanding Supporting Actress in a Miniseries or Movie, in 1979, for her work in the television movie Summer of My German Soldier. She is also credited for her role in the film, The Mighty Quinn (1989), starring Denzel Washington and Sheryl Lee Ralph, and featuring Robert Townsend. Her last film, Train Ride was released in 2000 despite being filmed in 1998.\n\nPersonal life\n\nRolle's only marriage was to Oscar Robinson. The two were married from 1955–1975. They had no children, but Oscar Robinson had a daughter, Sherley Mae Robinson, (born 1936), by his first marriage.\n\nRolle died on November 17, 1998 in Culver City, California, from complications of diabetes, nine days after her 78th birthday. Her body was flown back to her hometown of Pompano Beach, Florida. A devout member of the African Methodist Episcopal Church, Rolle requested that her funeral be held at Bethel African Methodist Episcopal Church.\n\nStage work\n\nDay of Absence (1965)\n\nHappy Ending (1965)\n\nThe Amen Corner (1965)\n\nMan Better Man (1969)\n\nAkokawe (1970)\n\nRide a Black Horse (1971)\n\nThe Dream on Monkey Mountain (1971)\n\nRosalee Pritchett (1971)\n\nDon't Play Us Cheap (1972)\n\nA Ballet Behind the Bridge (1972)\n\nHorowitz and Mrs. Washington (1980)\n\nNevis Mountain Dew (1980)\n\nDame Lorraine (1981)\n\nA Raisin in the Sun (1989)\n\nMember of the Wedding (1989)\n\nA Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet (1982)\n\nFilmography\n\nActress\n\n2000\n\nTrain Ride as\n\nDean of Students\n\n1998\n\nDown in the Delta as\n\nAnnie\n\n1998\n\nPoltergeist: The Legacy (TV Series) as\n\nGrandma Rose\n\n- La Belle Dame Sans Merci (1998) - Grandma Rose\n\n1997\n\nPromised Land (TV Series) as\n\nMary Harding\n\n- Amazing Grace: Part 2 (1997) - Mary Harding\n\n1997\n\nTouched by an Angel (TV Series) as\n\nMary Harding\n\n- Amazing Grace: Part 1 (1997) - Mary Harding\n\n1997\n\nRosewood as\n\nAunt Sarah\n\n1996\n\nMy Fellow Americans as\n\nRita\n\n1995\n\nHow to Make an American Quilt as\n\nAunt Pauline\n\n1994\n\nScarlett (TV Mini Series) as\n\nMammy\n\n- Episode #1.1 (1994) - Mammy\n\n1993\n\nTo Dance with the White Dog (TV Movie) as\n\nNeelie\n\n1993\n\nMessage from Nam (TV Movie) as\n\nQueenie / Elizabeth McQueen\n\n1993\n\nHouse of Cards as\n\nAdelle\n\n1991\n\nBlackbird Fly (Short)\n\n1991\n\nCape Fear as\n\nWoman Watching Cady Get Out from Under the Car (uncredited)\n\n1990\n\nThe Kid Who Loved Christmas (TV Movie) as\n\nEsther Clayton\n\n1990\n\nSinger & Sons (TV Series) as\n\nSarah Patterson\n\n- Our's Not to Reason Why Shmy (1990) - Sarah Patterson\n\n- Once Bitten (1990) - Sarah Patterson\n\n- The Boxer Rebellion (1990) - Sarah Patterson\n\n- Two Sons for Singer (1990) - Sarah Patterson\n\n1989\n\nAge-Old Friends (TV Movie) as\n\nMrs. Baker\n\n1989\n\nDriving Miss Daisy as\n\nIdella\n\n1989\n\nThe Mighty Quinn as\n\nUbu Pearl\n\n1989\n\nAmerican Playhouse (TV Series) as\n\nLena 'Mama' Younger\n\n- A Raisin in the Sun (1989) - Lena 'Mama' Younger\n\n1987\n\nP.K. and the Kid as\n\nMim\n\n1985\n\nThe Grand Baby (TV Movie) as\n\nMomma\n\n1985\n\nMurder, She Wrote (TV Series) as\n\nMargaret\n\n- Reflections of the Mind (1985) - Margaret\n\n1983\n\nThe Love Boat (TV Series) as\n\nLillian Randolph / Judge Kramer\n\n- Getting Started/Daughter's Dilemma/The Captain Wears Pantyhose (1985) - Lillian Randolph\n\n- I Like to Be in America/He Ain't Heavy/Abby's Maiden Voyage (1983) - Judge Kramer\n\n1985\n\nThe New Mike Hammer (TV Series) as\n\nViola Green\n\n- Deadly Reunion (1985) - Viola Green\n\n1984\n\nFinder of Lost Loves (TV Series) as\n\nNellie\n\n- Goodbye, Sara (1984) - Nellie\n\n1983\n\nFantasy Island (TV Series) as\n\nMama\n\n- Edward/Extraordinary Miss Jones (1983) - Mama\n\n1982\n\nThe Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet (TV Movie) as\n\nNurse\n\n1982\n\nThe New Odd Couple (TV Series) as\n\nMs. Gibbs\n\n- The Ides of April (1982) - Ms. Gibbs\n\n1982\n\nFlamingo Road (TV Series) as\n\nJulia\n\n- The Harder They Fall (1982) - Julia\n\n- The Bad and the Beautiful (1982) - Julia\n\n- The High and the Mighty (1982) - Julia\n\n1981\n\nDarkroom (TV Series) as\n\nOld Woman\n\n- Needlepoint (1981) - Old Woman\n\n1981\n\nSee China and Die (TV Movie) as\n\nMomma Sykes\n\n1974\n\nGood Times (TV Series) as\n\nFlorida Evans\n\n- The Evans' Dilemma (1979) - Florida Evans (credit only)\n\n- Cousin Raymond (1979) - Florida Evans\n\n- The End of the Rainbow (1979) - Florida Evans\n\n- A Matter of Mothers (1979) - Florida Evans\n\n- The Physical (1979) - Florida Evans\n\n- The Art Contest (1979) - Florida Evans\n\n- J.J. and T.C.
