        "text": "FORT LAUDERDALE, Fla. – One of America’s most iconic black actresses is being honored with a month-long exhibit at the Historic Ali Cultural Arts Center, located at 353 Martin Luther King Blvd. in Pompano Beach.\n\nKicking off yesterday and running through Dec. 2, “The Life of Esther Rolle Exhibit” examines the impact of the late award-winning actress, who was born, raised and is buried in Pompano Beach, Florida.\n\nPresented by the Historic Ali Cultural Arts Center and Rock Road Restoration Historical Group, the special exhibit honors the anniversary of Rolle’s birth and death, both of which occurred in November.\n\nShe attended Yale University, won an Emmy Award and was the first woman to receive the NAACP Chairman’s Civil Rights Leadership Award.\n\n“We are honored that Hazel Armbrister, a Pompano Beach historian, along with Ms. Rolle’s family members, Janice Rolle and Carter Allen, have coordinated this inspiring exhibit,” said Cherolyn Davis, director of programs and facilities. “Pompano Beach is very proud of all of the accomplishments Esther Rolle achieved during her illustrious career.”\n\nRolle still has a family home on NW 3rd Avenue in Pompano Beach that was renamed in her honor.\n\n“We look forward to celebrating Esther Rolle’s legacy through this photographic exhibit and introducing her impact to a new generation,” continued Davis. http://www.sfltimes.com/news/local/exhibit-honors-late-florida-born-actress-esther-rolle?fbclid=IwAR2zQDDcXFfMGALYCfr-pU12ZknkIEYveBcn-KD344rC-ICvXd8an30xHHE"
