        "text": "Join us for an inspiring LinkedIn Live event, Episode 1, celebrating the launch of the transformative anthology, \"Own Your Story: Empower. Connect. Create Change,\" on Thursday, July 18th at 8 PM ET. Stories have the incredible power to transform: they foster empathy, create connections, and remind us that we are more alike than different. In this anthology, women from diverse backgrounds, lived experiences, professions, and ages come together to share their unique stories. These narratives encompass growth, change, loss, love, enlightenment, strength, and resilience. Through their vulnerability, they remind us that authenticity is empowering—and they lead by example. During this live event, you'll hear from some of the contributing authors as they discuss their journeys and the impact of sharing their stories.
