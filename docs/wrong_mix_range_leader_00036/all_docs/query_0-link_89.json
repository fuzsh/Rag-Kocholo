        "text": "Between 2009 and 2010 we have experienced a major, emerging market equity and economic boom -- but at the very same time, sluggish growth in the United States. Foreign authorities are now reacting to inflation, raising interest rates, just as relative growth shifts to the U. S. I believe we will witness during this year, a Fed-fueled economic expansion, above consensus, in the United States.\n\nThe world community is gripped by the expectation of significant changes in the international monetary system, which has been permanently in crisis for decades. The uncertainty of the future gives rise to a sense of impending catastrophe, which must be prepared now, finding reliable anchors for preserving capital and providing an equivalent exchange in commodity markets. Historically, during a period of aggravation of the crisis of the international monetary system, monetary gold invariably remains as a reliable anchor, which is due not only to its unique properties, but also to the mentality of economic entities of all levels. The article deals with the basis of the emergence and periodic aggravation of the crises of the international monetary system, the causes of the new exacerbation, and the changing role of monetary gold in the process of globalization of the world economy. The role of international reserves in the gold reserve in the maintenance of socio-political stability is shown, the reasons determining the need to preserve and increase the gold reserves of central banks are substantiated.\n\nGold has recently been the main instrument of political revolt against the U.S.-dominated financial order. The dominance of the U.S. dollar is increasingly being challenged by gold and digital currencies as well as the growing trend to trade in national currencies. Many emerging or developing economies are building up their gold reserves. Even the BRICS countries are now working on a new gold-backed reserve currency.\n\nWe distinguish between good and bad deflations. In the former case, falling prices may be caused by aggregate supply (possibly driven by technology advances) increasing more rapidly than aggregate demand. In the latter case, declines in aggregate demand outpace any expansion in aggregate supply. This was the experience in the Great Depression (1929-33), the recession of 1919-21, and may be\n\nGold is used as a currencies comparative measure and, because of its properties (it does not rust) and use (in space industry, for example), it has a significant role in balancing both financial markets and economies. During crises, gold seldom loses value. We aim to show that price of gold is a stabilizing factor for the economic balance. We will do so utilizing the chaos theory, which gains more and more popularity in social sciences."
