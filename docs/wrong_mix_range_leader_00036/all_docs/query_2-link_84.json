        "text": "Python 3.13.0 Alpha 6 and 3.12.3 Arrive\n\nThis April, Python released its sixth alpha preview release, 3.13.0a6. This version is the last alpha release, as Python 3.13 will enter the beta phase on May 7. Once in beta, it won’t accept any new features.\n\nPython 3.13 brings the following new features:\n\nColorized exception tracebacks are now the default behavior in the interactive interpreter or REPL.\n\nAn experimental JIT compiler that provides the groundwork for significant performance improvements.\n\nThe garbage collector is now incremental, which should make the garbage collection process more efficient.\n\nStripped indentation in docstrings reduces memory usage and the size of .pyc files.\n\nMeanwhile, the standard library comes with these new features:\n\nThe dbm module has a new dbm.sqlite3 backend for creating new files.\n\nPEP 594 scheduled removals of many deprecated modules: aifc, audioop, chunk, cgi, cgitb, crypt, imghdr, mailcap, msilib, nis, nntplib, ossaudiodev, pipes, sndhdr, spwd, sunau, telnetlib, uu, xdrlib, lib2to3.\n\nMany deprecated classes, functions, and methods (dead batteries) were removed.\n\nNew deprecations appeared, and many of them were scheduled for removal in Python 3.15 or 3.16.\n\nFor a detailed list of changes, additions, and removals, you can check out the Changelog document. The next pre-release of Python 3.13 will be 3.13.0b1, which is currently scheduled for May 7.\n\nRegarding Python 3.12.3, you should know that it’s the newest maintenance release of Python’s latest major version. It contains more than 300 bug fixes, build improvements, and documentation updates.\n\nThe Python Software Foundation (PSF) Shares Great News\n\nThe Python Software Foundation (PSF) was also active in April, and they made a couple of exciting announcements that thrilled the Python community. Not only did they announce a new cybersecurity initiative for open-source software, but they also revealed the fellow members for the fourth quarter of 2023.\n\nNew Open Initiative for Cybersecurity Standards\n\nOn April 2, the PSF announced that they’re co-starting a new Open Initiative for Cybersecurity Standards collaboration with the Apache Software Foundation, the Eclipse Foundation, other code-hosting open-source foundations, industry players, and researchers.\n\nThe initiative aims to establish common specifications for secure software development based on existing open-source best practices. It’s an effort to meet the challenges of cybersecurity in the open-source ecosystem.\n\nFellow Members for Q4 2023\n\nIn February, the PSF announced the fourth batch of PSF fellows for 2023. These are people who make outstanding contributions to the Python community. This round, the PSF has added another name to the fellows list:\n\nJelle Zijlstra (Github, Quora)\n\nPSF fellows are members who have significantly contributed to the Python ecosystem by serving as extraordinary leaders, growing the Python scientific community, and maintaining libraries. They also create educational content, organize events and conferences, run local community organizations, mentor Python learners, and more. Congratulations Jelle!\n\nPython Events and Conferences Share Exciting News\n\nIn the fourth month of 2024, we also received some exciting news about the Python conferences that will be taking place in the upcoming months. The news is especially relevant for PyCon US 2024, which will be held in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, from May 15 to May 23.\n\nPyCon US 2024 Opens Its Call for Volunteers\n\nOn April 2, the conference blog announced that their call for volunteers is open for members of the Python community who want to get involved in the conference. Anyone interested can sign up for volunteer roles directly through the PyCon US website.\n\nHere’s a quick list of the roles currently available:\n\nRegistration\n\nInformation desk\n\nGreen room\n\nTutorial hosts\n\nSwag set up\n\nSwag handout\n\nSession staff (Chair / Runner)\n\nPyLadies auction helpers\n\nPSF booth\n\nCode of Conduct committee\n\nFor details on the role responsibilities, check the Volunteering page on the PyCon 2024 website. So, if you have a couple of hours to give to PyCon US and the Python community, then this could be a great opportunity for you. The organizers are aiming to fill over 300 onsite volunteer hours and would greatly appreciate your help!\n\nPyCon US 2024 Hatchery Programs\n\nPyCon US 2024 also announced its new hatchery program inclusions. The hatchery program initiative offers pathways for attendees to introduce new tracks, activities, summits, demos, and more at PyCon.\n\nIn previous PyCon editions, this program has hatched several new tracks, including Charlas, Mentored Sprints, and the Maintainer’s Summit. This year, the organizers got eight proposals, and now we’ll have four new programs:\n\nFlaskCon\n\nCommunity Organizers Summit\n\nHumble Data\n\nDocumentation Summit\n\nThese sound like a great set of new programs that will make PyCon US 2024 an outstanding Python conference. Don’t miss it!\n\nEssential Python Projects Release New Versions\n\nIn April 2024, the Python ecosystem continued to evolve and perfect their tools, frameworks, and libraries. A few essential Python projects rolled out new versions. Here are some of them:\n\nDjango bugfix release 5.0.4\n\nRuff 0.4.0\n\npandas 2.2.2\n\nPillow 10.3.0\n\nDjango 5.0.4 is a bugfix release that fixes several bugs, making the framework more stable and reliable.\n\nThe Ruff project also released a new version. Ruff is a fast Python linter and code formatter, written using the Rust programming language. You can use this tool to replace Black, Flake8, isort, pygostyle, pyupgrade, and a few others. This release switches from a generated parser to a hand-written recursive descent parser, which makes Ruff even faster with a 20 to 40% speedup for all linting and formatting invocations.\n\nThe pandas project also released version 2.2.2 with several changes. This is the first version of pandas that’s compatible with the upcoming NumPy 2.0 release. The wheels for pandas 2.2.2 will work with both NumPy 1.x and 2.x. Check the release notes for detailed information.\n\nFinally, the Pillow library, which is a tool for fast access to data stored in a few basic pixel formats, also released a new version. This new version includes bug fixes, deprecations, API changes and additions, and a few miscellaneous changes. Check the release notes for a complete list of changes.\n\nWhat’s Next for Python?\n\nApril 2024 was an exciting month for the Python community. We had the sixth alpha release of Python 3.13 and a new maintenance release of Python 3.12. Both bring exciting changes for the Python community.\n\nWe also received some good news from both the Python Software Foundation and PyCon US 2024.\n\nFinally, the Python ecosystem released new versions of Django, Ruff, pandas, and Pillow. We can’t wait to see what’s next! Let us know your thoughts on these developments in the comments below!\n\nHappy Pythoning!"
