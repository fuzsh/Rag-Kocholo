        "text": "For more than six months I've posted about Palestine daily. I truly believed that once people saw the truth something would change. Yet it seems the truth is something many are comfortable with. Some lives are worth more than others in this f**ked up world. Taking a day off feels like a failure. But I need one. My brother and niece are visiting from South Korea. To have family here is amazing and rare. Changes everything. Little bit less lonely, little bit more village. I already know how much we’ll miss them much they leave. But we’ll soon be preparing for the next visit. A luxury loads don’t have. Many in Palestine will never get their loved ones back. If they had them back, I wonder what they’d do? And I know. They'd love them. It’s one thing we will never regret doing. So if I seem distant over the coming weeks, it’s so those I’m with can feel me here. 💛 My niece could easily be Palestinian to look at. Having her here brings the reality of what Palestinian children (and aunties) are going through even closer. All that separates her from my friend Rasha’s daughter, who is also ten, is land. And one of the rare joys and reliefs my friend has in Gaza right now, is that her children have their cousins to play with, so boredom is eased. They’ll be visiting us here when they leave Gaza, too, so I look forward to the day our children can play together. Image: shot of my neice and son from behind holding hands in the park.\n\nThe ICJ ruling is a landmark moment. But it’s not over yet. Isreal is an apartheid state. This is no surprise to most of us. But the fact The Hague agrees shifts the power balance. Of course many will reject this. Those who have danced for tictok in their military gear. Those who have posted propaganda as if their lives depended upon it. Those that told lies bigger than themselves again and again long after they were disproven. They will feel humiliation. They will blame the world for their feelings. They will lash out. The ICJ ruling was non-binding. So what now? The Court concludes that the United Nations, especially the General Assembly and the Security Council, “should consider the precise modalities and further action required to bring to an end as rapidly as possible the unlawful presence of the State of Israel in the Occupied Palestinian Territory.” ⚠️It is not over.⚠️ Israel has shown how it acts in the face of being challenged. Our voice are needed more than ever. It is not too late to speak out for Palestine. 🇵🇸\n\nFor months telling my birth story would lead to hot tears. The shame of not being there for my son cracked my heart open. I knew how important the first moments were. The first hour of skin contact, of feeding, to create an unbreakable bond. Instead, he was alone. In a machine. Being brought to life. Whilst I was asleep. Under general anaesthetic. When they brought him to me I was looking for the feelings I was supposed to be feeling under the drugs and felt heavy with how sterile everything felt. The days that followed in hospital were a living hell. The walls kept moving in my mind. The screams of babies at night sounded like unworded trauma. And I was both desperate to leave and not ready when our time came. The months that followed were by far the most difficult of my life. Recovering from major surgery with a tiny human who I was convinced I wouldn't be able to keep safe. The unbearable pain of feeding that would lead to tears, which I was sure were drawing even more milk away from him. The sleep deprivation leading to hallucinations. The shame I felt as I realised I was broken. My body wasn't working. I'd already let him down. I was relieved when we were readmitted to hospital after four weeks. He had lost too much weight. I was relieved that they could help me look after him. Relieved that I could just lie down. Those months were dark. People speak of the wonder and joy and I felt that joy. But mostly, I felt darkness and fear and pain. And a complete disillusionment with the world. For the lack of support for women. For the lack of acknowledgment of just what we go through. This morning I received a message from my friend Noor. I can't write this without crying. Noor is in Gaza. She was 8 months pregnant. She told me she'd been in danger. That she'll started bleeding. That they'd told her she needed an emergency C section. That she was put under general anaesthetic. I waited for the next text, my heart in my throat. And when my friend said she'd had her baby. And that he was safe. My tears of relief quickly turned to tears of fear. How is my friend going to survive these months? They are living in a tent! The food is running out. The shelling is relentless. There is no moment of silence. No moment of peace. How can I help her from here? There are moments in which it is hard to have faith in humanity. But for all the difficulties I faced alone in the weeks after birth, the way that mothers came forward with their empathy, their vulnerability and their support, opened up a world I didn't know existed. Let's come through for Noor and baby Knan NB: I can't tag Noor here because she has been restricted from LinkedIn again. The inhuman beings that keep flagging her account can go straight to hell. We've gotten her back before but she's recovering from major surgery in a tent so it's not her priority. Image: Photo 1: My son Archie on the day of his birth. Photo 2: Noor's baby Knan on the day of his.\n\nEach week I have to say no to too many people. Sometimes that no is silent. Sadly, these days this is not a \"no\" to new work or additional scope. Or social events. It's a no to people asking for money to escape death. Many families in Gaza want to leave. They want to give their children a chance in life. A chance to live. Early on in this journey I worked out I had a choice. ❓ Focus on maintaining a strong income and support individuals that want to get out. Or ❓ Focus on advocacy work pushing for the change that will save millions of lives, not the one or two most privileged. One or the other. What a messed up conundrum. Not even one of the big NGOs is supporting their exit. The groups that have formed to help are overwhelmed. Without us, hundreds of thousands of Palestinians are alone. It is SO hard to say no. But sometimes we have to. Months ago, I decided that, after my son has what he needs and my marriage and local community are attended to, I turn to: Advocacy on and offline, raising awareness of Palestine, Palestinians and the corrupt nature of capitalist, colonial systems that drive genocide, and connecting communities. Supporting individuals and groups who are tired of the state of the system and want to use their voice and privilege to smash the status quo. Whilst also finding joy. Supporting three women, Rasha, Noor and Ameera. They have become good friends and we've collaborated with four wonderful women from around the world to give our friends in Gaza even more support. So I have really clear boundaries around supporting other families. I simply can't. This means I have many, many unanswered emails in my inbox from people asking for my support. My message to all of these families, including many that I have grown to love, is that I am sorry and if I haven't even replied, it is not because I don't care. MY ASK If you are in Gaza, and you do not currently have anyone supporting you hand-in-hand, please tag yourself in this post. You are welcome to add your story and fundraising page and please specify if you would like someone to come forward as a friend to support your efforts. For anyone else, if you would please reach out to a Palestinian family that is looking for support and get to know them. They will tell you what more they need. ♥️🖤🤍💚\n\nThis is my thank f**k that’s over face. It occured on the route home after a day out with my favourite human. He’s three. I’m forty two years older than him. And I’m not going to bother with the mandatory jazz about how important he is to me. I *started* with a headache. It is hard to remain present with your kid at the best of times. It’s like you’re counting down the minutes from the end of the first hour. (I hear you thinking that it’s not like that. Don’t lie to yourself. It’s exactly like that and it’s ok.) We have been literally trained to think that we deserve better than quality time with our kids. We have been taught to believe that we are only progressing when we are earning. We are so flipping trapped in a success story that has everything to do with money and power and status, that as soon as the sprog’s a 3D human, we are onto the next to do list item. Have child. Tick ✅ What’s next? It takes *effort* to believe being a mum is being enough. So today was a day that will be marked in my memory as moments of beauty. Perhaps I’ll remember The woods. The friends. The hugs and giggles. The beautiful summers day The serendipitous meetings. The precious adult conversations. The messages more precious than gold. And perhaps I’ll forget. ☹️ The headache. ☹️ My kid pushing over a younger kid. ☹️ Wondering if I’m failing as a mum. ☹️ Relentless screaming for an ice cream. ☹️ The baby girl my boy hit in the face. ☹️ The genocide in everything I saw. ☹️ The guilt of never doing quite enough. Because they aren’t in the photos. I hope you are finding space to have good days Or at the very least enough good moments To keep yourself doing the real work. Whatever that means to you. ♥️🖤🤍💚 Image: Kelly, blonde woman in mid-forties, in the woods on a much sunny day, smiling. Wearing denim dungarees, green T and wooden tree of life necklace.\n\nI’d love to be able to tell you I saved a man’s life today. But I don’t know if that’s true. (Trigger warning. Suicide.) I decided to take the scenic route home after a afternoon working in a coffee shop. There’s a point at which the canal crosses over the river. A beautiful spot so it’s not unusual to see someone leaning against the bridge wall, looking out on the river. They don’t normally carry steps and a massive bottle of cider, though. As I walked past, the man opened the bottle and took a swig. After I’d passed, I asked “Are you ok?” “Of course I’m ok. Don’t I look it?” He replied aggressively. “I tend to ask people if they’re ok when they’re hanging around here.” I said, indicating the bridge. “Oh. Yeah.” He said, “you know, don’t you?” “You’re not alright.” I said. “No. But I will be.” He looked out to the fifty foot drop to the river below. “It’s hard, isn’t it? This world.” I said and felt tears spring to my eyes and the same happened for him. I asked if I could give him a hug and he agreed. He noticed my Free Palestine 🇵🇸 bracelet and said he supported Palestine too. Said he’d seen documentaries and the way Palestinians have been treated for decades is criminal. After we’d been talking a while, he looked at me suspiciously. “You’re not gonna go are you.” He said. “You’re here for a reason.” He kept saying. And I agreed. Jay told me he’s an alcoholic who has brain damage following an accident and would never be able to work again. Apparently he has to pay for his own care out of his social money, leaving him with a tenner a day. This was his third suicide attempt. And I wish I could end this story saying I saved his life but I’ll probably never know. I convinced him to walk me to the exit of the canal, but he turned back towards where we’d met when he left me. When I got home, to a charged phone, I called the police as I wondered if I’d done enough to convince him. Maybe I ended up there at that moment to change his mind. Maybe he’ll curse me tomorrow when he wakes up alive. Or maybe not. What matters is I did the right thing. That’s all we can ever do. Jay is just one of millions who our systems let down. A man who the system doesn’t want or need. A man who deserved more. And no doubt once a child who did, too."
