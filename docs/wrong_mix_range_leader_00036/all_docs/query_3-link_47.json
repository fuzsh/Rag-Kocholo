        "text": "Fertile land is extremely scarce in Yemen. As agricultural productivity suffers from water scarcity and land degradation, larger landowners are purchasing smallholdings from struggling small farmers. The prices paid for the land are not reported. In urban areas some regulations have reduced the supply of land and caused prices to increase by requiring large lot sizes and land to be reserved for traffic and recreation. In addition, the land market has been affected by foreign buyers and speculators reselling government land made available for low fees in the years following unification in 1990 (World Bank 2007; World Bank 2003; Mahdi et al. 2007).\n\nThere is a trend toward increasing appropriation of communal land. Sheikhs are entrusted with management of communal land, and in areas of intensive land pressure, there have been incidents of sheikhs selling off communal land or transferring land for their personal use, in violation of their fiduciary role (World Bank 2007; ROY MPWH 2010).\n\nCOMPULSORY ACQUISITION OF PRIVATE PROPERTY RIGHTS BY GOVERNMENT\n\nThe Constitution provides that rights to private property be respected and protected; the state can expropriate land only when in the common interest, when absolutely necessary, and upon payment of fair compensation. The Public Eminent Domain Law of 1995 expands on the constitutional provision, providing that the state can expropriate land for vital projects (e.g., water sanitation installations, mining operations, airports, harbors, schools, roads, housing facilities). The government can take private land for vital projects only where it is deemed that there is no suitable public land alternative. The law recognizes several types of expropriation: administrative (between two administrative agencies), amicable (consensual and negotiated), judicial (upon showing of public interest before tribunal), temporary (e.g., needed for construction of public works), and expropriation for housing. The law provides for an administrative acquisition procedure with a judicial procedure for contested cases. GALSUP is responsible for setting property values for compensation (ROY1994; World Bank 2009b).\n\nLAND DISPUTES AND CONFLICTS\n\nEighty percent of disputes in Yemen are land-related. The country does not have a system for authenticating title deeds and land documents (formal or customary), and no national cadastre exists, a condition that creates space for fraud and results in land disputes. Access to water, which is tied to land rights, is a common cause of land disputes, particularly in areas of water scarcity (World Bank 2007; ROY MPWH 2010).\n\nThe majority of Yemenis do not seek resolution of land issues through the formal legal system. The formal court system requires a significant commitment of time and money and offers no guarantee of a fair result. The system suffers from inadequate administrative support, poorly trained staff, lack of appropriate education for the judges, burdensome caseloads, inadequate physical facilities, and widespread corruption. The system is also dominated by men, and rural women – 78% of whom are illiterate, their mobility restricted by cultural and religious norms – who are highly unlikely to use the formal court system (World Bank 2007; ROY MPWH 2010; Manea 2010; ROY 2002a).\n\nAt least 70% of disputes are settled in the traditional forum operated by the tribal sheikhs who are responsible for managing communal assets and resolving disputes, including those related to land and other natural resources. The sheikhs apply customary law (urf or shar) and commonly use conciliatory dispute-resolution methods of consultation such as consensus-building, and mediation (World Bank 2007).\n\nAs part of the government’s decentralization efforts, the Department of Tribal Affairs formalized the role of sheikhs, issuing many of them official identity cards. To some extent, formalizing the role of tribal leaders assimilated the customary system into the formal system, creating the potential for a single harmonized authority. However, the effort arguably weakened the traditional dispute-resolution system because communities lost their right to remove a sheikh from office. In addition, the sheikhs’ role within the government makes challenge less likely since residents and communities need strategic political connections. In some areas the sheikhs have lost their presumed neutrality because they stand to benefit from government land allocations and transfers to third parties (World Bank 2007).\n\nIn 2009 and with support from the World Bank, the government of Yemen undertook an Integrated Urban Development Project designed to: (a) improve the living conditions of poor and at-risk populations and reduce environmental degradation in Sana’a and Taiz; and (b) develop a national integrated plan for urban development that is locally administered and includes support for squatters and residents of low income informal settlements while providing upgraded living conditions (ROY MPWH 2010; World Bank 2008b).\n\nIn 2002, the Government of Yemen adopted a poverty reduction strategy that expressly recognizes the need to support the agricultural sector and improve women’s access to agricultural land. However the PSRP does not include any programs or initiatives to address land access and land tenure security for any groups, including women (ROY 2002a).\n\nDONOR INTERVENTIONS\n\nUSAID assists the government of Yemen in its efforts to strengthen its governance capacity, including the institutional development of local councils to support the electoral process and to mitigate tribal conflicts in rural areas and capacity-building for the judiciary. In 2005–2006, USAID conducted an assessment and developed a program focused on agricultural research and extension, women’s services and extension, integrated livestock activities, and horticulture marketing in five of the poorest governorates (USAID 2008; USAID 2005).\n\nBetween 1997 and 2007, the World Bank, International Fund for Agricultural Development (IFAD), the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), Germany, the Netherlands, Abu-Dhabi Fund, and the Islamic Bank supported several agricultural projects in Yemen. For example, IFAD managed a 7-year, US $38 million project from 1998–2005, focusing on land development of off- farm opportunities, and community development in an effort to improve the standard of living for landless rural residents. None of the projects focused on women farmers and none operated in the five poorest governorates targeted by USAID. None of the projects or programs appear to have components addressing land access or land tenure security (USAID 2005; IFAD 2009).\n\nThe Sisters Arabic Forum (SAF) works on women’s empowerment and improvement of women’s legal rights, including land rights in Yemen. The National Democratic Institute (NDI) and Islamic Relief are engaged in addressing rural tribal conflicts over access to natural resources, including land, through development of conflict mitigation procedures (NDI 2009; SAF 2009; IRW 2009)."
