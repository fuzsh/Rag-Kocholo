        "text": "Facilities\n\nDrama is based on two sites on the Streatham Campus. All the practical spaces we use are reserved solely for Drama students, giving us a high degree of flexibility.\n\nOur facilities include two digital media suites and upgraded technical facilities. We have six studios fully equipped for stage lighting and sound, 10 other studios and seminar rooms, two sound studios, a video and multimedia studio, state-of-the-art computer facilities for lighting and sound design, costume and props stores and workshops for set construction, costume and prop-making.\n\nResearch-inspired teaching\n\nTeaching that is inspired by research ensures lectures are up-to-date and relevant; you will benefit from access to the latest thinking, equipment and resources. All staff teach second and third year options which are linked to their own interests, including areas such as theories of actor training, non-Western performance, 20th and 21st century theatre practitioners, site-specific performance, applied performance, gender and performance, theatre history, music theatre, arts management and the politics of culture.\n\nOther opportunities\n\nThe Term Three Festival is a fringe-style experience, providing Drama students with exciting opportunities to showcase additional self-directed, non-assessed work. Students produce their own performances, take part in workshops, receive technical and practical training, participate in careers and employability sessions and watch over 50 brand new performances as part of the event. All students have the option to get involved with the Drama Society and a number of student-run theatre companies supported by the Students’ Guild.\n\nAcademic support\n\nYou will have access to an academic tutor who is available for advice and support throughout your studies. There are also several services on campus where you can get advice and information, including the Students’ Guild Advice Unit.\n\nTaking modules outside your course\n\nDepending on your programme you can take up to 30 credits each year in another subject, for instance a language or business module, to develop career-related skills or widen your intellectual horizons. If you achieve at least 60 credits in a language via our Language Centre you may be able to have the words ‘with proficiency in’ and the language added to your degree title.\n\nOptional modules outside of this course\n\nEach year, if you have optional modules available, you can take up to 30 credits in a subject outside of your course. This can increase your employability and widen your intellectual horizons.\n\nProficiency in a second subject\n\nIf you complete 60 credits of modules in one of the subjects below, you may have the words 'with proficiency in [e.g. Social Data Science]' added to your degree title when you graduate.\n\nA Foreign Language\n\nData Science\n\nEntrepreneurship\n\nInnovation\n\nLaw\n\nLeadership\n\nSocial Data Science"
