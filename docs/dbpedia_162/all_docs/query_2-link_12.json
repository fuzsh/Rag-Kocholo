        "text": "All undergraduate theatre majors at the University of Georgia must complete a core of theatre courses designed to introduce the various facets of the field of theatre, in addition to UGA core and Franklin College Requirements. The major includes courses in acting, design, play analysis and theatre history. In addition, two courses at one semester hour each are “Applied Drama” courses (THEA 2040 and 2050) involving the student in the actual work of theatre in such areas as costuming, stagecraft, and box office and promotion. THEA 2500 is strongly recommended for the first semester, along with either 3500 or 3290, or THEA 3300/3330/3340/3350/3520 if possible. In planning their schedules, students should note that Acting I (THEA 3500) is a prerequisite for most upper division acting courses (which are major electives) and limited to theatre majors.\n\nUp to date requirements for the degree can be found in the UGA Bulletin. During their first 60 credit hours, the student will work with a professional advisor in the office of the Franklin College of Arts and Sciences (with few exceptions). Students may also contact the department's upper division Academic Advisor with specific questions about the major. Once they have earned 60 total credit hours, they will be advised in the Department of Theatre and Film Studies and also be assigned a faculty mentor. Students with double majors should see their advisor in each major department every semester in order to receive complete advisement before registration.\n\nMAJOR Courses Required for the Bachelor of Arts Degree in Theatre\n\nMajor courses in addition to Core Areas I-V, Franklin College Requirements, and University Requirements.\n\nArea VI (18 Hours)\n\n8 hours in THEA: THEA 2500 (Theatre as Discipline and Profession), THEA 2040 (Applied Drama), THEA 2050 (Applied Drama), THEA 3290 or THEA 3291H (Script Analysis or Honors Script Analysis)\n\n10 hours in 1000/2000/3000-level fine arts and humanities:\n\nARHI, ARTS, ARST, DANC, MUSI, CLAS, CMLT, ENGL, HIST, PHIL, RELI.\n\nAlso allowed: ITAL 2500, PTSP 2550, ROML 2550, SPAN 2550, FILM 2120, FILM(AFAM) 2130, THEA 2060, THEA 2110 or 2110E, THEA 2140, COMM 1110. (THEA 2000, 2100H, and 2010 may be substituted if taken before declaring a theatre major at UGA)\n\nNote: If any of the courses in Area VI have been used to satisfy Areas II-V of the Core Curriculum, general electives may be taken here. (Refer to College-wide requirements when selecting general electives.)\n\nMAJOR REQUIREMENTS\n\n36-40 hours total (36 hours total for general major; areas of emphasis are 39-40 total hours).\n\nRequired Courses (21 hours)\n\nTHEA 3300 (3 hours) – Foundations of Entertainment Design\n\nTHEA 3500 (3 hours) – Foundations of Acting\n\nTHEA 4220 (3 hours) – Theatre and Society (offered in fall)\n\nTHEA 4210 (3 hours) – Theatre and Modernity (offered in spring)\n\nTHEA 5110 or THEA 5600 (3 hours) – Stage Management or Play Direction\n\nChoose one (3 hours):\n\nTHEA 3330 – Costume Crafts\n\nTHEA 3340 – Stagecraft\n\nTHEA 3350 –Lighting Technology\n\nTHEA 3520 – Makeup for the Performing Arts\n\nChoose one (3 Hours):\n\nTHEA 4230 Theatre and Ritual\n\nTHEA 4280 Women in Performance\n\nTHEA 4300 Queer Theatre and Film\n\nTHEA 4400 Asian Theatre and Drama\n\nTHEA (AFAM) 4460 History of Dramatic Art: Special Topics (Study Abroad)\n\nTHEA (AFST) 4470 African Theatre\n\nTHEA 4480 (AFAM) History of African-American Drama and Theatre\n\nTHEA 4500 The Broadway Musical and American Culture\n\nTHEA 4700 Dramaturgy\n\nTHEA 4800 Topics in History\n\nMajor Electives (15 -19 hours) Choose 5 three-hour FILM or THEA courses numbered 3000-level or above\n\nOR Complete one of the areas of emphasis below.\n\nNote:\n\nNo course will count toward the major unless it is earned with a grade of “C” or better. Note that a grade of “C-” does not satisfy this requirement.\n\nNon-equivalent transfer courses will not satisfy the requirements for the major; all transfer theatre courses must be evaluated by the department if equivalent credit is to be offered. We accept no more than 15 equivalent transfer credits toward major requirements.\n\nYou may not count courses in electives or areas of emphasis that have been counted in the major requirements.\n\nFranklin College requires in core Area IV study of a foreign language through the third semester or its equivalent.\n\nSTUDENTS CAN GET CREDIT FOR UNIVERSITY THEATRE SHOWS (acting, stage management, assistant directing, design, etc.) with THEA 5080. You can take up to three credit hours, and take the course twice. If you take three credit hours, that would count as a theatre major elective. You can get this credit during the semester you do the work or the semester immediately following. You can’t decide to take the credit a year later or more.\n\nOnce a student reaches 60 credit hours, they will need to be assigned a departmental advisor (see Dina Canup).\n\nCheck the UGA Bulletin http://bulletin.uga.edu for the most current UGA, Franklin College, and departmental requirements, and for most accurate course descriptions.\n\nAREAS OF EMPHASIS\n\nActing (19 hours)\n\nRequired courses (15 hours):\n\nTHEA 5010 Scene Study (pre req 3500)\n\nChoose four from the following:\n\nTHEA 5331 Shakespeare (pre req 3500, 5010)\n\nTHEA 5335 Shakespeare Practicum (permission of department)\n\nTHEA 5510 Physical Actor (pre req 3500)\n\nTHEA 5530 Voice for the Actor (pre req 3500)\n\nTHEA 5500 Advanced Acting (pre req 3500, 5010)\n\nTHEA 5550 Meisner Technique (pre req 3500 or permission of department)\n\nTHEA 5570 Acting on Camera (pre req 3500)\n\nTHEA 5080 Production Practicum (3 hours, for role in UGA Theatre production, permission of department)\n\nTHEA 5880 Performance Topics (permission of department, depending on topic) may also be substituted\n\nElective (3 hours): Choose one three-hour FILM or THEA course numbered 3000-level or above\n\nCapstone Course (1 hour):\n\nTHEA 5053 Senior Seminar: Audition preparation for graduating students for professional internship opportunities in ATL at Aurora Theatre, Actors Express, Georgia Ensemble, and more.\n\nDesign (19 hours)\n\nChoose one of the following (3 hours):\n\nTHEA 5330 Costume Design\n\nTHEA 5351 Scenic Design\n\nTHEA 5352 Lighting Design\n\nChoose four of the following (12 hours), if not taken in major requirements or above:\n\nTHEA 3330 Costume Crafts\n\nTHEA 3340 Stagecraft\n\nTHEA 3350 Lighting Technology\n\nTHEA 3520 Makeup for the Performing Arts\n\nTHEA 5110 Stage Management\n\nTHEA 5310 Technical Problems\n\nTHEA 5315 CAD, 2D, Drafting for Stage and Production Design\n\nTHEA 5320 CAD, 3D, Modeling and Visualization for Stage and Production Design\n\nTHEA 5330 Costume Design\n\nTHEA 5340 History of Costume and Adornment\n\nTHEA 5341 History of Architecture and Decoration\n\nTHEA 5351 Scenic Design\n\nTHEA 5352 Lighting Design\n\nTHEA 5372 Scenic Painting\n\nTHEA 5380 Design\n\nTHEA 5381 Entertainment Technology and Skills: Metals and Plastics\n\nTHEA 5382 Entertainment Technology and Skills: Rigging, Facilities, and Safety\n\nTHEA 5383 Management and Production for Theatre\n\nTHEA 5480 Topics in Design\n\nTHEA 5730 Advanced Costume Design\n\nTHEA 5732 Cutting and Draping Patterns for Costuming\n\nTHEA 5733 Millinery\n\nTHEA 5734 Stage and Screen Fabric Modification\n\nTHEA 5751 Advanced Scenic Design\n\nTHEA 5752 Advanced Lighting Design\n\nTHEA 5756 Automated Lighting and Visualization\n\nTHEA 5757 Lighting for Non-Traditional Events\n\nTHEA 5758 Architectural and Themed Lighting\n\nTHEA 5880 Sound Effects for Stage and Screen\n\nElective (3 hours): Choose one three-hour FILM or THEA course numbered 3000-level or above\n\nCapstone (1 hour): THEA 5970 Design Portfolio\n\nDirecting/Stage Management (19 hours)\n\nRequired (6 hours):\n\nTHEA 5600 Play Direction OR THEA 5110 Stage Management (take the course you have not already taken for the major requirement)\n\nTHEA 5080 Production Practicum (3 hours minimum credit) for assignment as AD, SM or ASM on a mainstage UGA Theatre production.
