        "text": "When it comes time to submit a feature-length screenplay to festivals worth the entry fee or industry gatekeepers, a writer can often get away with as few as 80 pages but should never go beyond 120 pages in a spec script. However, there are exceptions to this rule.\n\nSCREENPLAY PAGE SIZE\n\nExceptions to the rule\n\nOf course, there are plenty of movies that are longer than two hours. A film that is longer than two hours is typically considered ‘long.’ And when producers or other industry gatekeepers are looking at spec scripts, ‘long’ is not an adjective they are seeking.\n\nQuentin Tarantino’s best movies frequently cross the two-hour threshold and his scripts are much longer than average to match.\n\nThe reason why writers like Tarantino are able to break the established page-count rules is because they are established figures in the film industry. It is highly advised that an unknown writer stay below the 120-page threshold with their writing. Page count rules cease applying as strictly once you are a proven commodity in the film industry.\n\nHOW MANY MINUTES IS A PAGE OF SCRIPT\n\nWhy page count matters\n\nThe page count of a script is crucial because it directly correlates to the length of the finished film. The general \"script page to minutes\" rule of thumb is that one page of a screenplay equates to one minute of screen time.\n\nOf course, this is not a hard and fast rule and there are always exceptions. For example, one page of nothing but dialogue will probably not equal a minute on screen. And a page full of action/description will likely take longer than a minute. In other words, the \"script page to minutes\" rule is always an average.\n\nBefore scripts are shot, they are typically timed, a process by which the script is read aloud at the pace the screenplay is intended to unfold while tracking scenes on a stopwatch. The following video explains how to time a video script, but the process is similar to how a movie script is timed as well."
