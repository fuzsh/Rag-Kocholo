        "text": "Some films fade into obscurity, and only a few masterpieces live on in the hearts of viewers. Years go by, and countless movies are released, but only a few can match the jaw-dropping impact of these cinematic gems. This sentiment holds true for 21st-Century classics like Troy,The Lord of the Rings, 300, and Gladiator. Even though, upon its release in 2004, Troy wasn’t really considered a great film, over the years, a growing number of people have to come to realize what a rare gem the film truly is.\n\nThis action-packed and sandals-clad piece arrived following the success of films such as Lord of the Rings and Gladiator, and delivered stunning sequences and a compelling story, though it didn't reach the same heights as its counterparts. It was heavily criticized by critics for deviating from The Iliad, yet the duel between Hector and Achilles remains one the most epic battles ever depicted on-screen.\n\nThe films on this list share common themes of grand battles, historical context, and larger-than-life heroes, but they are not all the same. Titles like Braveheart, Ben-Hur, and Lord of the Rings have etched themselves as iconic entries in the realm of epic cinema. It is also worth noting that Gladiator 2 promises to bring back the glorious battles in 2024 with a second installment. Until then, here are 15 epic movies like Troy to watch next.\n\n15 Gladiator (2000)\n\nThe tale of Maximus, Gladiator draws everyone in with its phenomenal storyline and stunning action sequences. Despite its ancient setting, the film’s themes of vengeance, betrayal, and the struggle for justice are relatable and timeless. This epic film directed by Ridley Scott features Russel Crowe in one of his most memorable roles. He plays a powerful Roman general who falls victim to the treacherous Emperor Commodus, played by Joaquin Phoenix, causing him to lose his family while he is forced to become a gladiator.\n\nThroughout the film’s runtime, Maximus radiates hope and justice as he seeks vengeance on Commodus. There were so many elements that blended to make this film an epic akin to Troy, from the Scott’s strong direction to the iconic music, the memorable performances, impressive visuals, and more. Iconic phrases like \"Are you not entertained?\" were coined in this film.\n\nStream on Netflix\n\n14 300 (2006)\n\nSimilar to Troy, 300 features larger-than-life characters, grand battles and visual spectacle that captivates the audience. Loosely inspired by the Battle of Thermphylae, this stylized action film depicts the heroic stand of King Leonidas and his small band of Spartan warriors against the invading Persian Army. With its slow motion and visuals inspired by Frank Miller’s graphic novel, 300 seamlessly combines action with a style that pays homage to the source material.\n\nThe story may be bashed by history enthusiasts since it doesn’t provide a particularly accurate or in-depth portrayal of the Battle of Themopylae or Ancient Greece, however, the film has remained one thing even after 16 years of its release, and that is one of the most aesthetically spectacular, action-packed epic flicks. It sets out to entertain and does exactly that.\n\nRent on AppleTV\n\n13 Brave heart (1995)\n\nEpic films don’t get any more iconic than the exceptional Braveheart, which not only won several Academy Awards, but also set the benchmark for other films in its genre. It was also a huge success at the box office. Directed by Mel Gibson, who also stars as the brave Scottish hero, William Wallace, this film remains a brutal and monumental work with a simple message about freedom and having the bravery to seize it.\n\nLike Troy, Braveheart is replete with iconic battles, beloved characters, enduring themes, and an abundance of moments that are sure to evoke both smiles and tears. It is a brilliantly crafted story, and beneath its gory battle scenes, it encapsulates a beautiful love story and underscores the importance of brotherhood. James Horner’s awesome score enriches the poignant moments with depth and emotion.\n\nStream on DIRECTV\n\n12 Spartacus (1960)\n\nLong before the 2010 Spartacus series blew minds with its historical tale about a Thracian gladiator’s battle against the Roman Empire, there was the 1960 film version, also titled Spartacus. While it may not be so popular with younger generations of moviegoers given its outdated action and dialogue, it delivers an impressive and well-made narrative. Despite being a truly lengthy and old film, it boasts an immersive and comprehensive storyline, grand battle sequences and impressive set design.\n\nKirk Douglas was exceptional in his roles as Spartacus, with a strong supporting cast that drives the plot of the story and keeps many entertained. For those who enjoy films with an old-school epic feel, Spartacus is available to watch on Prime Video and other streaming platforms. It may not be Ben-Hur, but, like Troy, it is a solid epic in its own right.\n\nRent on AppleTV\n\n11 Alexander (2004)\n\nDirected by Oliver Stone, the historical epic film, Alexander, explores the life and conquest of Alexander the Great, the Macedonian King and military leader. The film features a star-studded cast that includes Colin Farrel, Angelina Jolie, Jonathan Rhys Meyers, Anthony Hopkins, and Christopher Plummer, among many others. Nevertheless, this impressive lineup didn’t save it from getting bashed by critics for its length, pacing, and mishandling of historical accuracy.\n\nAlexander may have been heavily criticized and controversial when it was released, per The Guardian, but to some viewers, it is an underrated gem that deserves more than the negative reception it has gotten so far. Just like Troy, these viewers appreciate it for its ambitious storytelling, grand scale, and exploration of a historical figure of great importance. Keep in mind that the director’s final cut offers a longer and potentially cohesive version of the film, which many might appreciate more than the original release.\n\nRent on AppleTV\n\n10 Centurion (2010)\n\nHistorical epic films don’t get any more exciting and intense than Centurion. It is a gritty film characterized by its brutal and visceral action sequences as it follows the story of Quintus Dias. Michael Fassbender plays this Roman soldier, who is a lone survivor of a Pictish attack on a Roman Fort. Behind enemy lines, he must try to survive while evading vengeful Pictish soldiers relentlessly hot on his trail.\n\nCenturion is a different kind of epic, focusing more on the survival and escape of Roman soldiers rather than the large-scale battles and mythology, as seen in Troy. That said, it is a cinematic experience that will deeply resonate with viewers open to a grittier and more realistic depiction of the Roman-British conflict. Neil Marshall’s directorial style is evident in the visceral and blood-soaked scenes that punctuate the film.\n\nStream on Hulu\n\n9 The Last Samurai (2003)\n\nIn Edward Zwick’s The Last Samurai, Tom Cruise plays the character Nathan Algren, a disillusioned American Civil War veteran who travels to Japan and becomes involved with a group of samurai during the 19th Century. Cruise’s performance was well-received for the depth and authenticity he brought to his portrayal of a character who undergoes significant personal and cultural transformation. His performance isn’t the only outstanding part of the film; Ken Watanabe’s portrayal of Kasumto is also exceptional.\n\nThe film was also praised for its aesthetics, which showcases the beautiful Japanese scenery, action sequences, and exploration of cultural themes. While The Last Samurai is historically significant and delves into the transitional period Japan experienced in the 19th century, this samurai film is primarily fiction. Though the film is quite lengthy, it is so gripping and immersive that it never feels overly long.\n\nStream on Paramount+\n\n8 Clash of the Titans (1981)\n\nPerseus, though not as popular as other legends such as Hercules, Theseus, and Jason, has a fascinating tale that unfolds like a classic sword-and-sorcery adventure. Loosely based on Greek mythology, Clash of the Titans depicts Perseus’ heroic journey to save Princess Andromeda. During this perilous quest, he confronts mythical creatures such as Medusa, Calibos, and other challenges to ultimately defeat the monster Kraken.\n\nWhile the special effects of this classical film may not be as glorious as that of the modern era, Ray Harryhausen’s stop-motion animation continues to earn praise for the enduring charm it brings to this film. For those seeking more polished special effects, the 2010 version offers a visually stunning rendition, albeit some found it lacking when compared to the original. Clash of the Titans is celebrated for its classic approach to Greek mythology and its memorable characters.\n\nRent on AppleTV\n\n7 The Last of the Mohicans (1992)\n\nThe Last of the Mohicans effectively captures the beauty and brutality of the American Frontier during the French and Indian war through the story of a man named Nathaniel “Hawkeye” Joe. Based on the 1826 novel of the same name by James Fenimore Cooper, it follows this hero’s journey through the wilderness with the last two survivors of the Mohican tribe. The film is marked by its intense action sequences, stunning cinematography and strong performances, particularly by Daniel Day-Lewis.\n\nMichalel Mann’s direction and the film’s evocative soundtrack also contribute to its overall appeal. It’s often lauded for its faithful adaptation to its source material. Apart from this, it has a mixture of romance, action and adventure that makes it a well-executed historical narrative. Even after over three decades, it continues to stand the test of time.\n\nRent on AppleTV\n\n6 Beowulf (2007)\n\nIn Beowulf, viewers get to see one of the most important works of old English literature come to life in a motion-capture technology and 3D visuals, a feature which could be either a strength or weakness depending on individual viewpoints. Some find the animation style innovative, while others who prefer a more traditional adaptation find it less appealing and distracting. Nevertheless, those who are interested in unique cinematic approaches to classic literature and enjoy exploring well-known tales will find this worth watching.\n\nJust like the famous Beowulf poem, this one follows as Beowulf fights monsters and dragons, including the infamous Grendel and Grendel’s mother. In tradition of Viking tales, it does not hold back in delivering great action scenes, violent moments and adult themes. Angelina Jolie, Anthony Hopkins, Ray Winstone, John Malcovitch and the rest were fantastic in their roles.\n\nStream on Paramount+\n\n5 The Lord of the Rings Trilogy\n\nPeter Jackson’s The Lord of the Rings film series, inspired by J.R.R Tolkien’s classic high fantasy novel series, is widely regarded as one of the greatest cinematic achievements in the history of filmmaking. Set in the Middle-earth, it follows diverse group of characters such as Frodo, Aragorn and Gandalf as they embark on a perilous journey to destroy the One Ring and defeat the Dark Sauron. The film features a memorable and lovaable cast with performances of actors such as Elijah Wood, Ian Mckellen, Viggo Mortensen receiving widespread praise.\n\nThe Lord of the Rings has a profound influence on the fantasy genre. All three films, including the 2022 series on Prime Video have been lauded for their epic stories, faithful adaption to the source material, groundbreaking special effects and more. The films are critically acclaimed and commercially successful.\n\nStream on Max or Prime Video\n\n4 Immortals (2011)\n\nIn Immortals, Henry Cavill plays the mortal chosen by the gods to battle against the ruthless King Hyperion. He is supported by an exceptional ensemble cast, featuring Mickey Rourke, Frieda Pinto, Stephen Darvos, Luke Evans, Isabel Lucas, John Hurt, and others. The film unfolds in Ancient Greece, where Theseus, aided by the virgin oracle Phaedra and other allies, confronts powerful foes to prevent a catastrophic war.\n\nWhile some find the plot a bit lacking in depth, Immortals compensates with its visually striking and stylized action sequences. It is a fast-paced, intriguing film with impressive special effects. It evokes the vibe of movies like 300,Clash of the Titans, and Troy, but falls short of reaching their level of greatness. Notwithstanding, it will be an eye-candy for any who enjoys epic fantasy battles and visually captivating cinematography.\n\nStream on Max\n\n3 Ben-Hur (1959)\n\nOut of the four films, the 1959 version of Ben-Hur stands as the most epic, with Charles Heston delivering one of his most iconic performances. This cinematic gem is the first film to secure 11 Academy Awards, a feat achieved by a select few like Titanic and Lord of the Rings. Directed by William Wyler, this film draws inspiration from Lew Wallace’ novel Ben-Hur: A Tale of Christ and tells the gripping saga of Judah Ben-Hur. He is a Jewish Prince who is falsely accused by his friend, Messala.\n\nAfter years of enslavement, his quest for revenge culminates in an awe-inspiring chariot race during which he encounters Jesus and undergoes a spiritual transformation. It is one of those sprawling epics that never feel dull or overly long. The realistic chariot race scene is one of the most memorable moments in the film.\n\nRent on AppleTV\n\n2 Kingdom of heaven (2005)\n\nDirected by the talented Ridley Scott and set during the Crusades, Kingdom of Heaven delves into the story of Balian, a former blacksmith who rises to knighthood and protects the city of Jerusalem against Saladin’s forces. The film features Orlando Bloom, Liam Neeson, Alexander Siddig, Edward Norton, Eva Green, Ghassan Massoud, and others, all of whom contribute to the depth and impact of the film. It explores the themes of faith, honor and clash of civilizations in a historical period.\n\nDespite being considered a masterpiece by those deeply moved by its powerful musical score, storyline, the great acting of the talented ensemble cast, and amazing visuals, this film received mixed reviews from critics. Criticisms center on aspects like pacing and character development. Nevertheless, it remains one of the best medieval films of all time.\n\nStream on Starz\n\n1 Robin Hood (2010)\n\nCrowe and Scott join forces once again to deliver a notably darker interpretation of a well-known tale, with Crowe portraying a tougher Robin Hood in the aptly titled Robin Hood. It tells the story of an archer named Robin Longstride who becomes an outlaw and leads a band of merry men against the sheriff of Nothingham. Scott, renowned for his ability to transport viewers to historical settings, deftly creates a dark and gritty medieval era, providing a version that feels more realistic and different from other films and stories on this legend.\n\nThe film also features brutal and grandiose battle scenes while also infusing humor and romance to balance the action and brutality within the evolving plot. However, due to the deviations from the traditional narrative, some feel it is uninspiring and less compelling while others see it as the start of a fresh Robin Hood adventure."
