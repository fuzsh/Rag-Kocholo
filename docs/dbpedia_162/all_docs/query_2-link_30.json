        "text": "EXCLUSIVE: Mucho Mas Media and Bonniedale Entertainment are teaming to release Julio Quintana’s sports drama The Long Game, starring Jay Hernandez and Dennis Quaid, on April 12 in theaters nationwide.\n\nThe movie made its world premiere at the 2023 SXSW Film Festival, where it won the Narrative Spotlight Audience Award and notched 75% fresh reviews on Rotten Tomatoes.\n\nThe film reps Quintana and Quaid’s reunion after the success of their first film, Netflix’s true-story sports drama Blue Miracle.\n\nThe Long Game, inspired by Humberto G. Garcia’s Mustang Miracle, follows the true story of five young Mexican American caddies in 1955 who created their own golf course in the middle of the South Texas brush country. Despite outdated and inferior equipment and no professional instruction to begin with, they would go on to compete against wealthy, all-white teams and win the 1957 Texas State High School Golf Championship.\n\n“We are thrilled to share this powerful and inspirational film with audiences across the country who can come as a family to celebrate this true underdog story. Making this film with an all-star Latino cast and crew and amazing partners like Bonniedale sets an exciting blueprint for Mucho Mas Releasing,” said Javier Chapa, co-founder of Mucho Mas Media.\n\n“I could not be more proud of The Long Game and place it in the same vein as The Rookie and Breaking Away. It’s a true and inspiring story beautifully put to screen by Julio Quintana. Great sports movies transcend the sport itself—this is an American dream story and exemplifies the kind of stories Bonniedale seeks to tell,” said star and producer Dennis Quaid.\n\nThe Long Game also stars Cheech Marin, Julian Works, Paulina Chavez, Jaina Lee Ortiz, Brett Cullen, and Oscar Nuñez. Quintana also wrote the script alongside Paco Farías and Jennifer Stetson; produced by Javier Chapa, Ben Howard, Dennis Quaid, Marla Quintana and Laura Quaid; executive produced by Hernandez, Phillip Braun, Christian Sosa, Simon Wise, Colleen Barshop and Vincent Cordero."
