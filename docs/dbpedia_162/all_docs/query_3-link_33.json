        "text": "Literary Genres: Further Exploration\n\nThis lesson explained what literary genres are and the four main types: poetry, fiction, non-fiction, and drama. Now it's time to challenge yourself with more activities that will make this lesson memorable and useful.\n\nQuiz Yourself\n\nNow that you know the four main literary genres, test yourself to see how much you can remember. Write down the titles of at least five works in each genre (use the examples given or find books in your house). Pull the titles out of a hat and see if you can remember which is which. Come back to this lesson any time you get stuck.\n\nExamples: The Hobbit by J.R.R. Tolkien, A Wizard of Earthsea by Ursula K. Le Guin, and The Hunger Games by Suzanne Collins, are fiction. ''This Is Just To Say'' by William Carlos Williams, ''The Orange'' by Wendy Cope, and ''Annabel Lee'' by Edgar Allan Poe are poetry. Quantum Theory Cannot Hurt You by Marcus Chown is non-fiction. Romeo and Juliet by William Shakespeare is drama.\n\nGet Creative: New Genres\n\nNew literary sub-genres (like sci-fi, romance, and mystery) get created all the time. A few examples of new genres include weird fiction by writers like China Mieville; Cli-Fi (climate fiction) by writers like Kim Stanley Robinson; and Bizarro, a new kind of absurdism by writers like James Steele. For this lesson, create your own new literary genre. What kinds of stories will be in this genre? What genres is it related to? Will it be best suited to poetry, fiction, non-fiction, or drama? Start your genre off with a piece of creative writing.\n\nWhat are the genres of literature? There are four main literary genres: poetry, fiction, nonfiction, and drama. The works within each genre share certain characteristics that place them in the same category. Furthermore, categories of literature can be divided into sub-genres. One trait that all genres of literature share is the use of figurative language, which includes literary devices like similes, metaphors, personification, and irony. This is not to say that a work of literature must contain figurative language, but that any work of literature may use it. The characteristics of each literary genre and sub-genre, as well as genre examples, are discussed in the following sections.\n\nPoetry as a Genre of Literature\n\nPoetry is one genre of literature. It is difficult to define what poetry is since its forms can differ widely; at its core, though, poetry is rhythmic writing that is meant to express or elicit an emotional response. There are several genre characteristics specific to poetry. Poems are usually shorter in length than other genres of literature. Poetry often draws heavily on imagery and figurative language to appeal to the reader's imagination. Poetry is usually arranged in lines and stanzas. Some poetry follows rules regarding the number of syllables within each line, and some poetry, called free verse, follows no rules. Poetry can also follow rhyming patterns, but rhyming is not a requirement.\n\nSub-Genres of Poetry\n\nTwo sub-genres of poetry include lyric and narrative. Lyric poetry expresses emotions rather than telling a story. For example, sonnets are a type of lyric poem. Sonnets contain fourteen lines and are usually written in iambic pentameter. The sonnets of William Shakespeare are among the most famous sonnets ever written. His sonnets are mostly about love and beauty. Shakespeare's ''Shall I Compare Thee to a Summer's Day?'' begins, ''Shall I compare thee to a summer's day? / Thou art more lovely and more temperate. / Rough winds do shake the darling buds of May, / And summer's lease hath all too short a date.''\n\nNarrative poems tell stories in poetic form. A well-known type of narrative poem is epic poetry. Epic poems are lengthy, serious in nature, and they recount heroic deeds and events occurring in a time before recorded history. The Epic of Gilgamesh is the oldest known epic poem and narrative, written in Mesopotamia around 3,000 BCE. Homer's Iliad, which narrates the final year of the Trojan War, and Odyssey, which recounts Odysseus' voyage home after the Trojan War, are two other famous epic poems, written during the 8th century BCE.\n\nThe poet, William Shakespeare, wrote 154 sonnets, which are examples of lyric poetry.\n\nFiction as a Literary Genre\n\nFiction is another genre of literature. Works of fiction are stories that are invented. Fiction is written in prose, the name for writing that is not organized in a formal pattern like poetry; in other words, fiction uses sentences and paragraphs rather than lines and stanzas.\n\nSub-Genres of Fiction\n\nSub-genres of fiction include novels and short stories. They also include fables (stories that teach moral or life lessons), legends (exaggerated stories handed down through generations), folk tales (traditional stories passed down through generations), and fairy tales (stories for children about magical creatures). Some well-known works of fiction are the children's book The Very Hungry Caterpillar by Eric Carle, the Harry Potter series for young adult readers by J.K. Rowling, Stephen King's thriller The Shining, and the classic novel To Kill a Mockingbird by Harper Lee.\n\nNonfiction as a Category of Literature\n\nA third genre of literature is non-fiction. Whereas fiction explores invented stories, nonfiction is about real things, people, events, and places. Books providing information on George Washington, the planet Mars, the American Civil War, and the islands of the Philippines would all be considered nonfiction. Like fiction, nonfiction is written in prose.\n\nSub-Genres of Nonfiction\n\nBiographies and autobiographies are two popular types of nonfiction. A biography is a book written about the life of a real person, while an autobiography is a book that a person has written about their own life. Other forms of nonfiction include essays, newspaper articles, journals, and personal diaries. The Diary of a Young Girl is an example of nonfiction; Anne Frank, a Jewish girl from Amsterdam, writes about her family's plight as they live in hiding from the Nazis during World War II. Unfortunately, Anne and her family were eventually captured. Her diary was later found by a friend and subsequently published.\n\nDrama as a Type of Literature\n\nThe final literary genre is drama. A drama is a story that is written to be performed for an audience. Actors impersonate the characters and act out the story's actions for the audience's entertainment. Dramas are often driven by conflicts between the characters. Unlike other works of prose, dramas rely on dialogue to tell their stories. Dialogue refers to conversations between or among characters.\n\nSub-Genres of Drama\n\nSome sub-genres of drama include comedies, tragedies, tragicomedies, and histories. William Shakespeare, the poet mentioned earlier in the lesson, was also a famous playwright. His plays are still studied in literature classes today and include tragedies such as Romeo and Juliet, Julius Caesar, and Hamlet, as well as comedies like Twelfth Night, A Midsummer's Night Dream, and Taming of the Shrew.\n\nDramas are meant to acted out on stage like this performance of Don Quixote.\n\nWhat is a Genre?\n\nEver have a friend suggest a movie to go see, but you responded, 'I'm not in the mood for that?' What did you mean? Was it a scary movie and you were in the mood to laugh? Was it a sad movie, but you wanted some action? If so, then you already know about genres.\n\nA genre is a broad term that translates from the French to mean 'kind' or 'type.' In entertainment, this can translate to horror, romance, science fiction, etc. In general, these types differ for all sorts of reasons, from the actions in their plots to the feelings they elicit from the audience. However, in literature, there are some more defined genres. It is important to know which genre a piece of work falls into because the reader will already have certain expectations before he even begins to read.\n\nGenre, in broad terms, refers to any works that share certain characteristics. If enough characteristics are in common, then the pieces are said to be in the same genre. In literature, there are four main genres to help the reader focus their expectations for the piece, though these genres can be broken down even further.\n\nTypes & Characteristics of Genres: Poetry\n\nA main literary genre is poetry. All poems share specific characteristics. For example, poetry is written in lines and stanzas instead of sentences and paragraphs. Some poems follow strict rules as to the number and length of lines and stanzas, whereas many poems are much more free-flowing.\n\nMost poetry is abundant in figurative language. Using devices like a simile, metaphor, hyperbole, onomatopoeia, alliteration, rhyme, and much more, poetry can claim an emphasis on imagination, emotions, and heartfelt ideas.\n\nPoetry is usually shorter than the other genres, but some poems are classified as epic poetry, which is long narrative poetry chronicling heroic deeds and serious subject matter. For example, John Milton's epic poem Paradise Lost focuses on Satan's fall from grace and his following pursuit of revenge.\n\nTypes & Characteristics of Genres: Fiction\n\nPoetry, however, is not the only genre that can utilize figurative language. Similarly, fiction, which is any work written in prose that is not real, can also use elaborate figurative language. However, fiction is much more structured than poetry. It must be written in sentences and paragraphs with all the proper punctuation and grammar, which makes it prose. Usually, fiction is broken up into chapters, as well.\n\nSince it is based on the imagination, the subject matter in fiction works can be nearly anything. Fiction can take place in the present day, the future, or the past. It can incorporate the most fantastical ideas or follow an everyday life. Some examples of works of fiction are legends, folk tales, fairy tales, short stories, and any novels. For example, the popular Hunger Games and Divergent trilogies are fiction which occurs in a post-apocalyptic future.\n\nTypes & Characteristics of Genres: Nonfiction\n\nA third broad literary genre is nonfiction. If fiction is fake, then nonfiction is the opposite: it comes from real life. Works of nonfiction are all based in real-world experiences. When you read the newspaper, you are reading nonfiction. Other examples include journals, diaries, biographies, autobiographies, and essays.\n\nNonfiction can also use figurative language; however, it is not as abundant as in poetry and even fiction. Figurative language in this genre generally comes through common phrases which are well-known and used on a daily basis by many. These pieces are written in prose, like fiction, and sometimes even in chapters.\n\nFor example, the popular book Anne Frank: Diary of a Young Girl is broken up into her specific diary entries. This book is simply a published diary written by a teenage Jewish girl who hid from the Germans in World War II. The diary was found after the girl perished, and her family published it without changing the written words. What Anne wrote was real. It was her life, and a great example of nonfiction."
