        "text": "Lisandro Alonso is one of the most celebrated Argentine filmmakers working today. And with that love, he’s been able to push the limits of cinema and really take risks. That’s evident in his newest film, “Eureka.”\n\nREAD MORE: ‘Eureka’ Review: ‘Jauja’ Filmmaker Lisandro Alonso Returns With Viggo Mortensen & Chiara Mastroianni For An Inconsistent Triptych [Cannes]\n\nAs seen in the trailer, “Eureka” isn’t an easy film to summarize. It takes place across various times and spaces, going from period Western setting to modern day South Dakota to 1970s Brazilian jungles. However, by showcasing these various times and locations, Alonso is able to shine a light on colonialism and its effects on indigenous populations.\n\nWe saw “Eureka” when it played at last year’s Cannes, and in our review, we said, “It’s an accomplishment already, the fact that this film exists, even if its current state does not reflect the maximum potential of everyone involved, and it has given us some of the most spellbinding images of the year.”\n\n“Eureka” is set to open in select theaters on September 20. You can watch the trailer below.\n\nHere’s the synopsis:\n\nTraversing time, space and genre, Argentinian filmmaker Lisandro Alonso (Jauja) presents an elliptical meditation on the experiences of indigenous communities across the Americas. Opening in a dusty town of the Old West, reality soon transitions to contemporary South Dakota’s Pine Ridge Reservation before finally landing in the jungles of 1970s Brazil. As the triptych unfolds, each temporal and spatial shift provokes metaphysical questions about colonial influence on native peoples and the ever-present tensions between indigeneity and the Western world."
