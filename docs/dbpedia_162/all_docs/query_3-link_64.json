        "text": "Genres again Here is a bar chart summarizing the 2012 movie genres from the suburban multiplex theatre, as seen in the pie chart in Exercise 11 .a) Were Action/Adventure or SciFi/Fantasy films more common?\n\nb) Is it easier to see that in a pie chart or the bar chart? Explain.\n\nMovie genres The Motion Picture Association of America (MPAA) rates each film to designate the appropriate audience. The ratings are G, PG, PG-13, and $\\mathrm{R}$. The ratings of the 20 top-grossing movies in the years 1996,2006,2008 and 2012 are shown in the following bar charts. The pie charts show the same data, but are unlabeled. Match each pie chart with the correct year.\n\nIdentify a film and classify it according to its genre (or subgenre). Include a link(s) to a trailer or scene(s) from the film. You may choose to continue with a film you have already discussed. Discuss the conventions that are typical in films of that genre (or subgenre). Explain how this specific film meets the expectations of its genre.\n\nIn Genre, Bordwell and Thompson suggest that there are various factors that may play a role in defining a film genre and that there are various conventional elements according to which genres can be analyzed. What are these defining factors and conventional elements? In your view, which of these factors and elements are characteristic of the Science Fiction genre and how do they typically find expression in Science Fiction film? Pick either A Trip to the Moon or Metropolis to explore to what extent the film of your choice shares or lacks elements commonly associated with Science Fiction film. Also consider other genres to which the film may belong. Discuss whether the film is first and foremost a Science Fiction film or whether it is best categorized as exhibiting some elements of Science fiction but belonging to a different genre.\n\nUsing specific examples from your chosen film, write an initial post of at least 200 words which shouldIdentify three actors from your film and classify each according to the acting category listed in your text. Explain your reasons for classifying the actors as you do. Use specific references to the film and pay special attention to how these decisions impacted characterization. Also, consider the impact of any realistic or stylized portrayals within the film. Focus on one of the actors you've discussed. Based on other films the actor has been in, would this actor always be placed in the same category? If so, what does this say about the category or actor? If not, what can you infer about the flexibility of these categories? Provide evidence (references from other films, including film clips and stills) to support your argument.\n\nIdentify a feature-length film that fits this genre and provide a basic summary of the movie. As you develop this summary, remember the differences between a film's story and a film's plot and how these differences can lead to the inclusion of genre elements. Interpret at least two genre conventions exhibited in your chosen feature-length film that help classify it in the selected genre. Be sure to provide a specific example of each convention (e.g., a particular scene or plot component). Provide an example of a third convention from your chosen feature-length film and explain how this convention expands the boundaries of the specified genre.\n\nI was trying to do this on the film Rocky. Explain genre theory and, using Chapter 3 of the text as a reference, describe the conventions and attributes of the genre you have selected. Identify a feature-length film that fits your selected genre and briefly summarize the movie. As you develop this summary, remember the differences between a film's story and a film's plot and be sure to highlight specific genre elements. Interpret at least two genre conventions exhibited in your chosen feature-length film that help classify it in the selected genre. Be sure to provide a specific example of each convention (e.g., a particular scene or plot component). Provide an example of a third convention from your chosen feature-length film and explain how this convention expands the boundaries of the specified genre."
