        "text": "In the wake of the Chinese Exclusion Act, an unlikely family carries invented biographies and poems of longing on an arduous journey from rural Taishan to Angel Island Detention Center, in hopes of landing in San Francisco. Intimate and epic, The Far Country weighs the true cost of selling the past for the hope of a brighter future.\n\nProduction support for The Far Country is provided by Yale’s Binger Center for New Theatre.\n\nTHE FAR COUNTRY is presented through special arrangement with and all authorized performance materials are supplied by\n\nTRW PLAYS 1180 Avenue of the Americas, Suite 640, New York, NY 10036. www.trwplays.com\n\nVideos Photos\n\nAuthor’s Note\n\nI’m grateful to honor an extraordinary book that served as a critical and primary source for my research process on this play: Island: Poetry and History of Chinese Immigrants on Angel Island, 1910-1940, Lai, Him Mark, Genny Lim, and Judy Yung, eds. © 2014, Reg. No. TX 8-066-082 (University of Washington Press listing).\n\nThe book is not just a wide-ranging account of the Exclusion Era and the history of Angel Island Immigration Station, it is also a compilation of the extraordinary poetry found on the walls in the detention center, and an important, remarkable document of a pivotal and under-examined period in Asian American history.\n\nI’m deeply grateful to Genny Lim, not only for her generous permission to include excerpts from her translations of the poems in the text of the play, but even more for the extraordinary and comprehensive work she has done over many years to unearth, illuminate, and share the history it contains. I’m also deeply sorry for not including this acknowledgement during the first two productions of the play – because without Genny’s work, along with her colleagues Him Mark Lai and Judy Yung, this history would still be completely hidden from the world. Their passion and commitment to sharing the voices and experiences of the poets of Angel Island were not only of critical importance to the play, they are of critical importance to the history of Asian America. I hope you will take a deeper dive into this history through this groundbreaking book, and I can’t thank Genny and her colleagues enough for all they’ve done to give voice to the poets of Angel Island.\n\nYALE REP @ NHFPL\n\nThursday, May 9, 2024, 6-7PM\n\nFair Haven Library, 182 Grand Avenue, New Haven\n\nJoin us for an information session about Spanish-captioned performances at Yale Rep, how to get free tickets through the library, and our production of The Far Country by Lloyd Suh. This session will be led by staff and artists from Yale Rep. The session will be in both Spanish and English.\n\nSaturday, May 11, 2024, 11AM\n\nIves Main Library, 133 Elm Street, New Haven\n\nJoin us for a special story time and kite-making activity. Actor Jesse Cao Long of The Far Country will read Paper Son: The Inspiring Story of Tyrus Wong, Immigrant and Artist by Julie Leung and Chris Sasaki. Inspired by Wong’s work as a kite-maker, each child will get a chance to construct and take home their own paper kite."
