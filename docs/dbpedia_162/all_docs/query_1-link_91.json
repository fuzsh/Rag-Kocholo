        "text": "As well as following Essie (Ruby Ruiz) and Puri (Amelyn Pardenilla), we also get a window into the life of Charly (Bonde Sham) and her friend Will Or (Tong Ng), as well as Hilary's seemingly composed and wealthy friend Flora (Olivia Chu), who is navigating a dwindling marriage and loneliness.\n\nThe episode can easily be watched on its own, as the main plot line around Margaret and her family takes more of a backseat here. The series, of course, centres on the sudden and tragic disappearance of her son, following Margaret as she struggles to deal with the loss.\n\nBased on the internationally best-selling novel The Expatriates by Janice YK Lee, the new series comes from director Lulu Wang, who is best known for having directed drama film The Farewell.\n\nMore like this\n\nWang previously revealed that each episode of the show can be viewed in any random order, telling The Guardian: \"I’m sort of curious to talk to people who start with different ones. It’s my little experiment, I guess, to see if they bring different things.\"\n\nWith only one episode of the series left to be released, when can we expect the finale? Read on to find out more about the release schedule for Expats.\n\nWhen is episode 6 of Expats on Prime Video?\n\nExpats episode 6 will be released on Prime Video on Friday 23rd February.\n\nEpisodes of the new drama are being released weekly every Friday, with the series having premiered on Friday 26th January and being set to conclude with its finale on Friday 23rd February.\n\nHow many episodes of Expats are there?\n\nThere are six episodes of Expats in total.\n\nExpats release schedule\n\nThe series premiered with two episodes on Prime Video and will subsequently release an episode weekly every Friday.\n\nEpisode 1 – Expats – Friday 26th January (out now)\n\nEpisode 2 – Mongkok – Friday 26th January (out now)\n\nEpisode 3 – Mid-Levels – Friday 2nd February (out now)\n\nEpisode 4 – Mainland – Friday 9th February (out now)\n\nEpisode 5 – Central – Friday 16th February (out now)\n\nEpisode 6 – Home – Friday 23rd February\n\nExpats trailer\n\nYou can watch the moving trailer for the new drama below:\n\nExpats episodes 1-5 are available on Prime Video, with episodes being released weekly.
