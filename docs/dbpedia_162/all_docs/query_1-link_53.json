        "text": "“Hi, I’m David Leitch. And I’m the director of ‘The Fall Guy.’ So I’m super excited. This is one of my favorite scenes in the movie. It’s like our setup. You see Ryan and Emily in a flashback where they are flirting.” “Oh, I was going to go for a spicy margarita after work. And I was wondering if you drink spicy margaritas?” [LAUGHS] “Well, just to keep it professional, I can only have one spicy margarita because if I have two, I start making bad decisions.” “This scene is all shot as a oner. It’s no cuts. So it was really a challenge for what’s going to come next. Ryan is having to play this charming, charismatic guy, knowing that we’re going to actually hook him to a 120-foot descender. A descender is a rig where we drop someone off a building or whatever. And the mechanism below actually decels him for the last 10 feet. That’s the actual stunt team right there. Keir Beck is hooking him in right now with the other Australian rigging team. And they’re getting ready to put Ryan over the edge.” “After this, you and I could both be on a beach somewhere in swimming costumes, drinking spicy margaritas.” “As a stunt person, this is not unusual. You would be having a conversation right up to the time you’re doing the stunt, finding the time to center yourself as they hang you over. It’s pretty amazing that he’s keeping his composure. We actually did this practically. This is all real. And this is in a building in Sydney. It took us about four months to get the permits to build the truss we needed to do, and get all the engineering and safety requirements out of the way. And this might be take two. But Ryan was such a good sport. I know he knew at some point, it’s called ‘The Fall Guy,’ he knew he was going to have to do something like this. So there he goes.” “Action! Action! Action! Action!” [WHIRRING]"
