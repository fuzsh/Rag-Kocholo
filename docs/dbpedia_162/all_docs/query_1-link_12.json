        "text": "Are movies really getting longer?\n\nThese days, it feels like there's always an extra-long cinematic epic on the horizon. Films like Cleopatra, Ben-Hur, Gone With The Wind, and Lawrence of Arabia have been around for decades, but it certainly feels like more new movies than ever are clocking in well beyond the two-hour mark.\n\nThe latest film to make headlines about its runtime is Martin Scorcese's Killers of the Flower Moon, a Western crime drama exploring a series of murders in the Osage Nation after oil was discovered on their land... and it clocks in at an impressive 206 minutes, or just under three and a half hours long.\n\nScorsese has defended the movie's runtime passionately, and we'd like to make it clear we aren't debating whether longer movies are a good thing or not here. If the story is worth getting invested in and the pacing's just right, it's easy to lose yourself in a big movie.\n\nTo try and get an idea of whether movies really are getting longer or not, we looked at the top 10 movies from the US Box Office in 2021, 2011, 2001, 1991, and 1981 (as they are listed on boxofficemojo.com). We then compared the average runtimes from these five decades to see if we could spot a trend. And in our latest update, we've added in the top 10 from 2022 to see whether those releases affected our findings.\n\nGoing by this particular dataset, it certainly looks like we're spending more time than we used to in the movie theater. The average runtime of the top ten movies from 2021 (131 minutes) was nine minutes longer than that of the 2011 top performers (122 minutes), and that trend only got more pronounced the further back we looked.\n\nThrowing 2022 into the mix makes this trend even easier to spot. 2022's average runtime was 141 minutes, making it 10 minutes longer than the average from 2021 (131 minutes). And when you look further back, the trend looks more pronounced (aside from 2011).\n\nFor a more detailed breakdown of the runtimes and the lists of the top 10 releases from each of the years we looked at, read on.\n\nAre movies really getting longer? Our data\n\n2022 — average 141 minutes\n\nIt's perhaps no surprise that the average run time for 2022 is so high. This year saw the release of both The Batman and the long-awaited sequel, Avatar: The Way of Water, the latter of which easily clocks in as the longest movie in our sample. Plus, there was only one film in the top-ten on the shorter end in the form of Minions 2.\n\nNote: we included the run time for the extended cut of Spider-Man: No Way Home since the \"More Fun Stuff\" version of the movie hit theaters this year, which will also have an impact on the runtime average.\n\n2022's top ten movies at the US Box Office, and their runtimes:\n\nTop Gun: Maverick: 131 minutes\n\nBlack Panther: Wakanda Forever: 141 minutes\n\nDoctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness: 126 minutes\n\nAvatar: The Way of Water: 192 minutes\n\nJurassic World: Dominion: 147 minutes\n\nMinions: The Rise of Gru: 98 minutes\n\nThe Batman: 176 minutes\n\nThor: Love and Thunder: 118 minutes\n\nSpider-Man: No Way Home: 161 minutes\n\nSonic the Hedgehog 2:122 minutes\n\n2021 — average 131 minutes\n\nAt 131 minutes, 2021's average runtime is easily the longest. Only A Quiet Place 2 and Venom: Let There Be Carnage came in around the 90-minute mark.\n\nMeanwhile, the majority of the year's top ten movies ran well beyond the two-hour mark, and the longest (No Time To Die) clocked in at 163 minutes.\n\n2021's top-ten movies at the US Box Office, and their runtimes:\n\nSpider-Man: No Way Home: 148 minutes\n\nShang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings: 132 minutes\n\nVenom: Let There Be Carnage: 97 minutes\n\nBlack Widow: 134 minutes\n\nF9: The Fast Saga: 143 minutes\n\nEternals: 156 minutes\n\nNo Time To Die: 163 minutes\n\nA Quiet Place II: 97 minutes\n\nGhostbusters: Afterlife: 124 minutes\n\nFree Guy: 115 minutes\n\n2011 — average 122 minutes\n\nThe average runtime amongst the top ten movies in 2011 was 122 minutes. Looking at the group, there wasn't a single movie in the top ten that ran for less than 90 minutes, and half of them ran for over two hours.\n\nThe longest film of the group was the third Transformers movie, Transformers: Dark of the Moon, which ran for 154 minutes.\n\n2011's top ten movies at the US Box Office, and their runtimes:\n\nHarry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2: 130 minutes\n\nTransformers: Dark of the Moon: 154 minutes\n\nThe Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn - Part I: 117 minutes\n\nThe Hangover Part II: 102 minutes\n\nPirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides: 137 minutes\n\nFast Five: 130 minutes\n\nCars 2: 106 minutes\n\nThor: 115 minutes\n\nRise of the Planet of the Apes: 105 minutes\n\nCaptain America: The First Avenger: 124 minutes\n\n2001 — average 126 minutes\n\n2001 is an interesting year in our sample because it's the only year out of the original five we looked at that bucks the trend. Here, the average movie runtime of the top box-office success stories clocked in at 126 minutes, 4 minutes longer than the average in 2011.\n\nThis particular year is notable for the release of Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone (152 mins) and The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring (178 mins), two massive films that will have affected the average runtime. And they weren't even the longest movie in the table, either. That honor belongs to Michael Bay's war drama Pearl Harbor, which ran for a little over three hours.\n\n2001's top ten movies at the US Box Office, and their runtimes:\n\nHarry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone: 152 minutes\n\nShrek: 90 minutes\n\nMonsters, Inc.: 92 minutes\n\nRush Hour 2: 90 minutes\n\nThe Mummy Returns: 130 minutes\n\nPearl Harbor: 183 minutes\n\nJurassic Park III: 92 minutes\n\nPlanet of the Apes: 119 minutes\n\nHannibal: 131 minutes\n\nThe Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring: 178 minutes\n\n1991 - average 117 minutes\n\nKevin Costner clearly loved a long movie! Even though the theatrical cut of Dances With Wolves premiered in 1990, it was still among the top ten movies of 1991. The nearest rival to Costner's epic war drama was Kevin Reynolds' Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves (which also starred Costner as Robin of Loxley).\n\nHowever, this group also contains some of the shortest movies in our entire sample size, so it's understandable why the average runtime for 1991's top ten was only 117 minutes.\n\n1991's top ten movies at the US Box Office, and their run times:\n\nTerminator 2: Judgment Day: 137 minutes\n\nRobin Hood: Prince of Thieves: 143 minutes\n\nHome Alone: 103 minutes\n\nThe Silence of the Lambs: 118 minutes\n\nCity Slickers: 113 minutes\n\nDances With Wolves: 181 minutes\n\nSleeping With The Enemy: 99 minutes\n\nThe Addams Family: 99 minutes\n\nThe Naked Gun 2 1/2: The Smell of Fear: 85 minutes\n\nTeenage Mutant Ninja Turtles II: The Secret of the Ooze: 88 minutes\n\n1981 — average 110 minutes\n\nAlthough the average runtime for 1981's top-ten movies clocks in at just 110 minutes, the split is more even than some of the other years on this list.\n\nThe longest film, Excalibur, clocks in at 140 minutes, but most of the films on this list fall between the 90-min to the 2-hour mark; even the second-longest (and top-grossing) movie of the year, Superman II, just crept over the 120-minute mark.\n\n1981's top ten movies at the US Box Office, and their run times:"
