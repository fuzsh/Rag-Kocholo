        "text": "David Nicholls’ best-selling novel ‘One Day’ is returning to the screen in a 14-part Netflix series.\n\nHaving previously been adapted into a movie with Anne Hathaway back in 2011, the new interpretation fleshes out more of the book and includes some brand new storylines not featured in the original novel.\n\nWith filming locations from glamorous Rome to the motorways of Wolverhampton, the drama covers 20 years of intertwined lives, unspoken romance, and buckets of nostalgia.\n\nHere’s all you need to know on the romantic drama released just in time for Valentine’s Day.\n\nWhat is One Day about?\n\nThe romantic drama tells the story of Emma and Dexter, who have an instant connection when they meet at a university graduation party.\n\nOne Day follows the pair on July 15 each year from 1988 to 2011, as they juggle friendship and an unspoken romance. While Dexter finds success on TV in the 90s, Emma is stuck working in a hilariously chaotic Mexican restaurant, but their careers and personal lives will both reach new highs and lows until an emotional climax.\n\nWhere was One Day filmed?\n\nThe drama takes place in multiple locations across its central romance spanning 20 years.\n\nBeginning with Emma and Dex’s first meeting at a university graduation party in 1988, the scenes were filmed in the courtyard of The Old College, a historic building at the University of Edinburgh.\n\nAfter their ‘sort-of one-night stand’, Emma and Dexter hike up Edinburgh’s tourist hotspot of Arthur’s Seat. Actor Leo Woodall revealed at the One Day premiere that he had food poisoning for the duration of the scenes filmed atop the picturesque hill.\n\nCharacters return to Arthur’s Seat in the final episodes of the series, but the 40mph winds caused havoc for the actors wearing latex prosthetics used to make them look 20 years older.\n\nThe closing moments in episode one where Dexter chases after Emma to get her phone number was filmed on the Vennel Steps, tucked off of the colourful buildings of the Grassmarket, with an incredible view of Edinburgh Castle.\n\nEpisode two sees Dexter on an extended holiday in Rome, where he meets his mother on the Spanish Steps and idyllic alleyways that recently played a pivotal role during Mission: Impossible – Dead Reckoning.\n\nDexter’s parents are staying at the Boutique Hotel Campo de’ Fiori, with scenes taking in the picturesque streets of Piazza del Biscione.\n\nMuch of the series takes place in London, but back in an era where the skyline featured nothing more than the BT Tower and St Paul’s Cathedral. We get a glimpse of Clapton Overground Station when Emma moves down to the Big Smoke, with other shots of the long tunnels between platforms at King’s Cross tube station.\n\nLoco Caliente, the Mexican restaurant where Emma and Ian work, was actually filmed at Old Suffolk Punch, a pub in Hammersmith.\n\nLater in the series, Fire nightclub in Vauxhall doubles as a Brixton venue, and in the same episode Emma and Ian go on a date that was filmed at Smith & Wollensky steak restaurant on the Strand and the nearby Adelphi theatre, currently home to the Back to the Future musical.\n\nEpisode seven sees Dexter and Emma catch-up over dinner with Mayfair’s Quaglino’s brasserie standing in for fictional restaurant The Pacific.\n\nEpisode 11 has Dexter working temporarily in the kitchen of a friend’s restaurant, which was actually filmed in Maoz on Old Compton Street – one of the best spots in Soho for a quick lunch or pre-drinks meal. (Their chicken pitta with all the salads is to die for.)\n\nKeeping with the food theme, in episode 13 we see Dexter, Emma and Jasmine eating at a pizza restaurant, with Bella Roma in Lewisham being used for the scenes.\n\nWithout venturing too far into spoiler territory, we also see Dexter pop up in a cafe at the end of the series, with Islington's La Maison standing in.\n\nWho is in the cast?\n\nAmbika Mod and Leo Woodall take on the lead roles of Emma Morley and Dexter Mayhew.\n\nTV fans will recognise Ambika from two of the most impressive TV series of recent years, medical drama This Is Going to Hurt, where she played the role of an overworked junior doctor, and I Hate Suzie Too, starring opposite Billie Piper.\n\nLeo Woodall is best known for his appearance in The White Lotus, as Essex lad Jack, winning an award for his role in the ensemble cast. He is set to appear in the Amazon Prime series Citadel.\n\nJonny Weldon plays hopeless romantic, hopeless comedian, and well, just hopeless in everything Ian, who goes from Emma’s colleague at the Mexican restaurant to boyfriend. Jonny is a bit of a social media star with hilarious skits garnering him a loyal following who will no doubt be thrilled to see him in his most prominent role to date.\n\nNewcomer Amber Grappy is the comedic backbone of the first episode as Tilly, Emma’s roommate and best friend who does her best to orchestrate the romance between the leads.\n\nEleanor Tomlinson arrives midway through the series as Sylvie, Dex’s most serious girlfriend with an aristocratic background and a family that are reluctant to accept Dex. Eleanor Tomlinson’s previous credits include Poldark, The White Queen and teen flick Angus, Thongs and Perfect Snogging.\n\nThe cast also includes Essie Davis (The Babadook) and Tim McInnerny (Notting Hill) as Dex’s parents Alison and Stephen.\n\nHow can I watch One Day?\n\nAll 14 episodes of One Day landed on Netflix on 8 February. Each episode has a running time of around 30 minutes, so you can easily binge the whole series over a weekend.\n\nIf you want to check out the original source material, the best-selling novel by David Nicholls is available in all book shops.\n\nWhile the 2011 movie starring Anne Hathaway isn’t on any streaming services, it is available to rent from Amazon and Apple, and is scheduled to air on Film4 around Valentines Day, so expect to see it pop up on Channel 4’s streaming service soon after.\n\nIs there a trailer for One Day?\n\nYes, feast your eyes on the below trailer to get a taste of the romantic drama that will have you bingeing the whole series in one sitting.\n\nIs there any new content that wasn’t in the book?\n\nYes! David Nicholls even wrote the penultimate episode of the series and he revealed at the One Day premiere that the 13th episode is completely brand new with some twists that weren’t included in the novel.\n\nElsewhere, elements that were only briefly mentioned in the original novel are now fully fleshed out with new characters and storylines, such as Emma’s experience in a touring theatre group in episode two.\n\nWhat have the reviews been like?\n\nTo say that the reviews have been glowing would be an understatement. The BBC’s write-up calls it ‘A perfectly judged adaptation of David Nicholls’s novel’, while The Guardian describes it as a ‘highly bingeable love story packed with magnificent nostalgia and a sublime soundtrack’. Mashable praises co-stars Ambika Mod and Leo Woodall’s ‘complex, lived-in performances’. ‘The young actors establish an onscreen relationship that feels visceral and real,’ agrees USA Today.\n\nBut some critics have found the show’s will-they/won’t-they romance too cheesy. ‘[It’s a] grand, saccharine, predictable love affair,’ grumbles India’s The Hindu, and the UK’s The Telegraph describes the show as a ‘bingeable, sentimental romance with all the depth of a puddle’.\n\nWhat other novels has David Nicholls penned?\n\n‘One Day’ author David Nicholls has also enjoyed huge success with books including ‘Starter for 10’, ‘The Understudy’, and ‘Us’.\n\nStarter for 10 was adapted into a movie in 2006 with James McAvoy as a student who lands a place on legendary TV quiz show, University Challenge.\n\nNicholls’ novel Us was adapted for the small screen in a four-part BBC series that featured Tom Hollander and Saskia Reeves as a couple hoping to revive their marriage on holiday.\n\nOne Day soundtrack: the full tracklist for the Netflix drama by episode."
