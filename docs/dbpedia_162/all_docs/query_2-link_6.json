BUT, the thing that gets to me is the price of the episodes and the limited chances to earn more coins. The episodes are 45secs-1min long and can cost as much as 60 coins for an episode. You also canât check to see how much the episodes cost before you start watching. You only see the amount once youâve run out of coins and the app wants you to buy more. You do get the daily bonus of either 25 or 30 coins depending on the day youâre checking in, and thereâs 6 chances to get an additional 25 coins each by watching the 6 ads/day. That comes out to about 3 episodes if theyâre 50 coins each. And sometimes the ads are longer than the episodes. Again, the stories are great and i understand that they take money to film, but having to buy coins when youâre sucked into a show for a 45 sec episode is a bit much. I know the smaller packs arenât unreasonably priced, but the amount of ads you get as youâre watching back to back is crazy, even with having coins available.\n\nI think 20-25 coins per episode max across the board would be more reasonable considering thatâs what youâd get from the opportunities to earn coins. 3 stars because i like the stories but am not made of money lol. At least let me see how much the episodes are before i get into it!!\n\n3kirsten ,\n\nGood Shows but Not Very Userfriendly\n\nThe shows are good and some are awesome; however, the app isnât very user-friendly. Some examples of why it isnât very user-friendly are, 1-there isnât a clear button to add a show to your personal list, 2-the episodes open without you selecting to open them so you can see how many coins is needed per episode nor are you alerted when your coins are being used, 3- you arenât aware of when youâre running out of coins because you have no control of when a locked episode will unlock while watching and 4-the TT app gives you a view of 10 epis which is great for deciding if you want to watch it on the Short app, but on the app you are buying about 3 episodes that you have already been able to view which seems strange. You would think the app should start unlocking with the 11th episode instead of the 6th or 7th episode. Though I get it takes money to produce the episodes, there should be some awareness indicator or step in place so viewers know when coins are being used or when a locked episode needs to be unlocked to give viewers the choice to use their coins or sample other shows at their leisure.\n\nThe pros are the 1-voice-overs are good translations to English, 2- there are a lot of shows to select from to watch, 3-the prices for coin packages is reasonably inexpensive for the smaller packages."
