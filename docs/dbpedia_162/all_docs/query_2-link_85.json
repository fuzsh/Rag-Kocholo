        "text": "Netflix is set to soon release a series adaptation of David Nicholls’ novel One Day, which was previously adapted as a film in 2011 starring Anne Hathaway. Filming took place throughout 2022 and will star This Is Going to Hurt breakout star Amika Mob. We’re keeping track of everything you need to know about One Day on Netflix below.\n\nThe writing team is led by BAFTA-winning Nicole Taylor (Wild Rose, Three Girls), working with Anna Jordan (Killing Eve, Succession), Vinay Patel (Doctor Who) and Bijan Sheibani (Morning Song).\n\nOne Day is a Drama Republic production with Universal International Studios and Focus Features. Drama Republic worked with Netflix previously on The Irregulars which was canceled after a single season.\n\nNige Watson serves as producer on the series. Roanna Benn, Jude Liknaitzky, David Nicholls, and Nicole Taylor serve as executive producers.\n\nWhat’s the Netflix release date for One Day?\n\nNetflix has finally confirmed that One Day is being released worldwide on the streaming service on February 8th, 2024.\n\nWhat’s the plot of One Day?\n\nBased on David Nicholls’ 2009 novel of the same name, the One Day series follows Emma Morley and Dexter Mayhew catching up the same day each year after they first meet at university in 1988 and watching how they grow and change, move together and apart, experience joy and heartbreak.\n\nHere’s a more detailed synopsis of the story:\n\nIt’s 1988 and Dexter Mayhew and Emma Morley have only just met. They both know that the next day, after college graduation, they must go their separate ways. But after only one day together, they cannot stop thinking about one another. As the years go by, Dex and Em begin to lead separate lives—lives very different from the people they once dreamed they’d become. And yet, unable to let go of that special something that grabbed onto them that first night, an extraordinary relationship develops between the two. Over 20 years, snapshots of that relationship are revealed on the same day—July 15th—of each year. Dex and Em face squabbles and fights, hopes and missed opportunities, laughter and tears. And as the true meaning of this one crucial day is revealed, they must come to grips with the nature of love and life itself.\n\nThe book has already been adapted into a feature film in 2011 starring Anne Hathaway. It was released by Universal Pictures and scored $59 million at the box office on a budget of just $15 million.\n\nWhether the new Netflix series will borrow ideas seen in the film remains to be seen. Here’s the trailer for the movie which is on December 27th, 2021 is streaming on 12 Netflix countries including Netflix Canada.\n\nWho is cast in One Day?\n\nTaking on the role of Emma Morley is Ambika Mod, who was most recently seen in the British drama series This Is Going to Hurt as Shruti, which was credited as her breakout role.\n\nSpeaking to RadioTimes.com, Mod told them she was optimistic about the series, saying, “I think the way that our writers are going about it is really beautiful, and hopefully, people will just be able to see more of the book in the series.”\n\nAnother newcomer, Leo Woodall, has been cast as Dexter Mayhew. Woodall has already made his Netflix debut in the 2021 crime drama Cherry. The actor also starred in the HBO Original comedy series The White Lotus.\n\nEleanor Tomlinson has been cast as Sylvie. Tomlinson had previously starred in a Netflix film when she starred as Hayley in the wedding comedy Love Wedding Repeat.
