        "text": "What does an executive producer do?\n\nThe executive producer is usually the leader of the whole TV drama – the person who oversees its journey from script to screen.\n\nHowever, the role varies considerably depending on a variety of factors. Sometimes the title of executive producer is a nominal. It’s used to credit an established writer who has signed off a drama but had little to do with its production. It’s a role that applies to TV drama, rather than film.\n\nMostly, executive producers acquire screenplays for development. They pitch ideas to the TV commissioners and deal with the legal, financial, and marketing aspects of the TV series. They are the spokesperson for the production and have the final say.\n\nThe extent to which they’re involved in the production itself varies. Sometimes they play a role in scripting, casting and crewing. Other times those tasks are left to the producer, production manager, and casting director.\n\nMany executive producers are freelance. Often, they are the owners of the production company that’s making the drama. They usually are working on several productions at the same time.\n\nWatch and read\n\nHow to become an executive producer\n\nWhat does an executive producer do?\n\nWhat’s an executive producer good at?"
