        "text": "Stream these for your next family movie night with the kids\n\nTriStar Pictures/Walt Disney Pictures/Warner Bros. Pictures\n\nSnuggling up together on the couch with the kids, an entertaining family movie and a giant bowl of popcorn is hands down one of the best ways to enjoy some quality family time (at least in my humble opinion). But deciding on a film that everybody wants to watch isn’t easy (cue the sibling bickering).\n\nAs an aunt of three very picky young nephews and a teenage niece, I know a thing or two about selecting movies that cater to diverse age groups. So, whether you’re looking for a classic flick (like The Goonies) or an upbeat musical (like The Greatest Showman or Coco), there’s something for everyone on this list. And if you prefer to keep your movie night short and sweet, we've got run times, in addition to casting details and where to watch (like Netflix, Prime Video, Disney+ and more). From Moana to Toy Story, here are 83 family movies that all generations will love, including throwbacks from your own childhood. Dim the lights, prepare your snacks and enjoy.\n\nRELATED\n\nThe 57 Best Teen Movies of All Time\n\n1. The Goonies (1985)\n\nSuitable for: Kids ages 10+\n\nRating: PG\n\nWho's in it: Sean Astin, Josh Brolin, Jeff Cohen, Corey Feldman\n\nRun time: 114 minutes\n\nThis coming-of-age ’80s classic has got it all: hidden treasure, everlasting friendship, edge-of-your-seat thrills and a young Josh Brolin. The bad guys (the thieving Fratellis) are a little scary, which is why I recommend saving this one for kiddies ten years and up.\n\nIf you're still having doubts about this one, then take it from PureWow's VP of News & Entertainment, Philip Mutz, who considers it a childhood favorite. He said, \"I still remember watching The Goonies with my parents and younger brother as a kid (obviously both of us wished we could be one of the Goonies—honestly, I probably still do). Goonies never say die!\"\n\n2. The Super Mario Bros. Movie (2023)\n\nSuitable for: Kids ages 8+\n\nRating: PG\n\nWho's in it: Chris Pratt, Anya Taylor-Joy, Charlie Day, Jack Black\n\nRun time: 92 minutes\n\nIf you love the classic video game, you'll want to tune in to this nostalgic film that follows Mario and his friends as they battle the one and only Bowser. It features an all-star voiceover cast, including Keegan-Michael Key, Seth Rogen and more.\n\nWhile Quint isn't a big fan of the film, it's a favorite for her kids. She said, \"This movie is objectively terrible, but for some reason kids love it (I have been forced to see it twice in the movie theater) and there's something oddly hypnotic about Jack Black singing about Princess Peach.\"\n\n3. The Greatest Showman (2017)\n\nSuitable for: Kids ages 8+\n\nRating: PG\n\nWho's in it: Hugh Jackman, Zac Efron, Michelle Williams, Rebecca Ferguson, Zendaya\n\nRun time: 105 minutes\n\nGet into your comfy clothes and bring out the popcorn because this family-friendly musical will keep everyone entertained—for at least an hour and 45 minutes. Hugh Jackman plays legendary Ringling Bros. and Barnum & Bailey Circus showman P.T. Barnum, in this film that follows his rise into showbiz and worldwide fame.\n\nPureWow Associate Editor Chelsea Candelario said, \"I'm a BIG musicals fan and this one is on the top of my must-watch list. The entire cast is phenomenal. (Um, hello Zendaya and Zac Efron's duet!) And it's such a catchy film to watch with the whole fam.\"\n\n4. Moana (2016)\n\nSuitable for: Kids ages 5+\n\nRating: PG\n\nWho's in it: Auliʻi Cravalho, Dwayne Johnson, Rachel House, Temuera Morrison\n\nRun time: 103 minutes\n\nThe first of many Disney flicks on our list, this musical adventure earns extra points for its killer soundtrack (courtesy of Lin-Manuel Miranda) and total badass heroine (no prince swooping in to rescue her). Follow brave Moana as she sets out to explore the Polynesian seas with the help of demigod sidekick Maui in order to save her island. (Note: There’s a scary-ish scene at the end with a sputtering volcano that you may want to fast-forward for younger viewers.)\n\nPureWow Associate SEO Editor Marissa Wu said, \"Dwayne Johnson as Maui was hilarious (like, his theme song is 'You're Welcome,' how can you not laugh?!). But honestly, I stayed for the compelling story of a young woman searching for her identity while trying to save her people.\"\n\n5. Annie (2014)\n\nSuitable for: Kids ages 8+\n\nRating: PG\n\nWho's in it: Quvenzhané Wallis, Jamie Foxx, Rose Byrne\n\nRun time: 118 minutes\n\nIf your kids like to complain about doing their chores, wait until they see what Annie has to put up with. There have been a few versions of this musical rags-to-riches story, including John Huston's 1982 classic. But I think this 2014 rendition, with its unforgettable characters and catchy tunes, is the best.\n\nPureWow Associate Sales & Deals Editor Destinee Scott says, \"Annie is my favorite, and it's not only because I have a small crush on Jamie Foxx...The movie is funny, uplifting and just so inspiring. I always feel warm and fuzzy after watching it, and everyone knows the plot, but for me, it's all about finding love in the places you least expect it.\"\n\n6. The Lego Movie (2014)\n\nSuitable for: Kids ages 6+\n\nRating: PG\n\nWho's in it: Chris Pratt, Will Ferrell, Elizabeth Banks, Will Arnett\n\nRun time: 100 minutes\n\nEverything is awesome in this animated movie inspired by the popular toys, especially the stellar cast. Will ordinary construction worker Emmet Brickowski be able to defeat the evil Lord Business from Kragling (i.e., gluing) the Lego universe? Guess you'll have to watch to find out.\n\nAccording to PureWow Editor-in-Chief Jillian Quint, \"This movie is so subversive and weird—full disclosure—my husband and I first saw it in the theater without our kids. But kids also love the bananas plotlines and lessons about creative play. And my kids are ALWAYS singing the 'Everything is Awesome' song.\"\n\n7. Princess and the Frog (2009)\n\nSuitable for: Kids ages 6+\n\nRating: PG\n\nWho's in it: Anika Noni Rose, Bruno Campos, Michael-Leon Wooley\n\nRun time: 97 minutes\n\nTiana’s dream of opening a restaurant is put on hold when she meets Prince Naveen, who was turned into a frog by the evil villain, Dr. Facilier. From gorgeous animation to well-rounded characters, what's not to love?\n\nAssistant Editor Delia Curtis said, \"As someone who doesn’t always gravitate toward animated movies, The Princess and the Frog had me hooked!! I loved the jazzy, Southern flare that this film had. The strong, belt-it-out lyrics are fun for the whole family. It’s also a film that adults can appreciate too, with some of those silly sly jokes that only adults will pick up.\"\n\n8. E.T. The Extra-Terrestrial (1982)\n\nSuitable for: Kids ages 8+\n\nRating: PG-13\n\nWho's in it: Dee Wallace, Henry Thomas, Peter Coyote\n\nRun time: 115 minutes\n\nSteven Spielberg's classic sci-fi story of an extraterrestrial stranded on planet Earth is pure movie magic. Parents will love the nostalgia throwback (baby-faced Drew Barrymore) and little ones will love the adorable E.T. and his friendship with his earthling family (although keep in mind that there is some light swearing and a few sad moments). Oh, and Reese’s Pieces are a must while watching.\n\n\"I fully believe there is no greater children's movie,\" said Quint. \"I've watched with my 7 and 9-year-old, who are really the perfect ages for appreciating the magic while also understanding the gravity.\"\n\n9. Elemental (2023)\n\nSuitable for: Kids ages 8+\n\nRating: PG\n\nWho's in it: Leah Lewis, Mamoudou Athie, Ronnie del Carmen, Shila Ommi\n\nRun time: 103 minutes\n\nThe film is set in a world where elements of nature—fire, water, land and air—coexist as one community. Everything changes when Ember Lumen, a fire element, befriends Wade Ripple, a water element, and discovers their commonalities.\n\nRachel Gulmi, Director of Special Projects, said, \"It is visually so beautiful and enticing with all the colors and how everything comes together, but I love the message behind it and it actually made me tear up.\"\n\n10. Luca (2021)\n\nSuitable for: Kids ages 6+\n\nRating: PG\n\nWho's in it: Jacob Tremblay, Jack Dylan Grazer, Emma Berman, Saverio Raimondo\n\nRun time: 95 minutes\n\nSet in a beautiful seaside town on the Italian Riviera, this recently-released Disney and Pixar flick tells the story of a young boy, Luca, who is having the best summer of his life eating gelato and riding on a scooter with his new best friend, Alberto. There’s just one problem...the duo are sea monsters from another world below water.\n\nQuint calls it a \"charming movie with a great message,\" adding, \"My kids love the naughty boyhood hi-jinx, and I love feeling transported to the Amalfi coast.\"\n\n11. Daddy Day Care (2003)\n\nSuitable for: Kids ages 5+\n\nRating: PG\n\nWho's in it: Eddie Murphy, Jeff Garlin, Steve Zahn, Regina King\n\nRun time: 92 minutes\n\nWhen Charlie and his friend lose their jobs, they make the drastic decision of turning Charlie's home into a daycare center. Chaos ensues, however, when a rival daycare tries to shut them down.\n\nCurtis, who rewatched the film as an adult, said, \"The jokes hit different as an adult because they most definitely have some hidden meaning. I also loved that the story revolves around expectations around gender roles and undoing the stereotypes that women are the only capable caretakers. Plus, I will never get over the scene of Eddie Murphy and Jeff Garlin having a boxing match dressed as a carrot and a broccoli.\"\n\n12. Stand By Me (1986)\n\nSuitable for: Kids ages 12+\n\nRating: R\n\nWho's in it: Wil Wheaton, River Phoenix, Corey Feldman\n\nRun time: 89 minutes\n\nThis coming-of-age story about four 12-year-old boys in 1950s Oregon is an inspiring tale of friendship, growing up and doing the right thing. Featuring some darker themes (making this film best for teens and up), this moving film strikes the right balance of childhood adventure, grown-up drama and a cute Jerry O’Connell.\n\n13. Toy Story (1995)\n\nSuitable for: Kids ages 6+\n\nRating: G\n\nWho's in it: Tom Hanks, Tim Allen, Don Rickles, Jim Varney\n\nRun time: 81 minutes\n\nWith enough inside jokes for adults, this animated film of toys coming to life is perfect for family movie night. It’s so good, it spawned three sequels and numerous spin-offs, setting you up for the next couple of weekends.\n\nQuint said, \"It's hard to believe this movie is from 1995—it feels so current, both in look and in message. When my kids were little, we watched it approximately 1,000 times, and it's still a favorite.\"\n\n14. The Karate Kid (1984)\n\nSuitable for: Kids ages 8+\n\nRating: PG\n\nWho's in it: Ralph Macchio, Noriyuki \"Pat\" Morita, Elisabeth Shue\n\nRun time: 126 minutes\n\nConfession: Mr. Miyagi's iconic \"Wax on, wax off\" scene still lives rent-free in my head. And LaRusso's final match against Lawrence? Arguably one of the best moments in cinematic history. When Daniel LaRusso enrolls at a new school, he tries to defend himself from bullies and enlists the help of Mr. Miyagi—a repairman who also happens to be a martial arts master.\n\n15. Raya and the Last Dragon (2021)\n\nSuitable for: Kids ages 6+\n\nRating: PG\n\nWho's in it: Paul Briggs, Don Hall, Adele Lim, Carlos López Estrada\n\nRun time: 117 minutes\n\nThis animated film introduces viewers to a warrior named Raya, who tries to find the last dragon in an ancient civilization. To top it off, the magical creature is voiced by Crazy Rich Asians star Awkwafina.\n\nExecutive Editor Alexia Dellner's son is just one of many who enjoyed the film. She said, \"My 4-year-old was definitely scared during quite a few parts of this one BUT, he ultimately loved it. The plot is really interesting (I thought so too!), the characters feel fresh and the takeaways are very sweet without being saccharine. Just maybe wait until your kid is 5 or 6 to show it to them.\"\n\n16. The Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants (2005)\n\nSuitable for: Kids ages 12+\n\nRating: PG\n\nWho's in it: America Ferrera, Amber Tamblyn, Blake Lively, Alexis Bledel\n\nRun time: 119 minutes\n\nA group of best friends are preparing to spend their first summer apart. In an attempt to stay connected, they create a custody schedule…for a pair of jeans.\n\nCurtis, who grew up watching the comedy-drama, said, \"When I was a kid, finding confidence in the shape of my body was a tough thing to do in the early '00s. Magazines and TV shows glorified skinny bodies, but I’ll never forget the moment when America Ferrera, the curviest girl in the friend group, tried on the magic pants and they fit her like a glove. It made me feel seen and beautiful. A great film about friendship, connection and self-acceptance.\"\n\n17. Where the Wild Things Are (2009)\n\nSuitable for: Kids ages 10+\n\nRating: PG\n\nWho's in it: Lauren Ambrose, Chris Cooper, James Gandolfini, Catherine O'Hara\n\nRun time: 101 minutes\n\nWhere the Wild Things Are tells the story of a boy named Max, who travels to a magical island inhabited by creatures called the \"Wild Things.\" Exploring themes of loneliness and insecurity, director Spike Jonze revisits the classic children’s story in a dreamlike atmosphere. Read the book to your 5-year-old, but save the film for your tween.\n\n18. Enchanted (2007)\n\nSuitable for: Kids ages 5+\n\nRating: PG\n\nWho's in it: Amy Adams, Patrick Dempsey, James Marsden, Timothy Spall\n\nRun time: 107 minutes\n\nAmy Adams shines in this sweet musical comedy in which she plays a fairy-tale princess trying to live happily ever after in Andalasia. That is, until her evil mother-in-law banishes her to real-life New York City. She sings, she dances—is there anything Adams can’t do? (Fun fact: the movie is based on Gail Carson Levine's fantasy novel, Ella Enchanted, which is a retelling of Cinderella.)\n\nTouchwood Pacific Partners/Walt Disney Pictures\n\n19. Homeward Bound: The Incredible Journey (1993)\n\nSuitable for: Kids ages 5+\n\nRating: G\n\nWho's in it: Michael J. Fox, Don Ameche, Sally Field\n\nRun time: 84 minutes\n\nCraving a feel-good flick that centers on animals? Make room on the couch and let your furry friends watch this uplifting adventure film with you as lovable pups Shadow and Chance and kitty cat Sassy journey across the country to be reunited with their humans. Based on Sheila Burnford's novel of the same name, this movie—which marked Duwayne Dunham's feature film debut—is so charming and funny. Plus, it boasts an incredible voice cast.\n\n20. The Hunger Games (2012)\n\nSuitable for: Kids ages 12+\n\nRating: PG-13\n\nWho's in it: Jennifer Lawrence, Josh Hutcherson, Liam Hemsworth\n\nRun time: 144 minutes\n\nIn this film based on Suzanne Collins's hugely popular YA series, plucky Katniss Everdeen (played by the brilliant Lawrence) is the perfect role model for teenage girls. After volunteering as tribute to compete in the deadly Hunger Games, Katniss bravely fights against the evil Panem nation. (And there's a budding romance between her and fellow volunteer, Peeta.)\n\n21. Finding Nemo (2003)\n\nSuitable for: Kids ages 4+\n\nRating: G\n\nWho's in it: Albert Brooks, Ellen DeGeneres, Alexander Gould\n\nRun time: 100 minutes\n\nDive into this adorable underwater flick that’s got plenty of giggles and morals for younger viewers (and adults) including the importance of teamwork, embracing what makes you unique and how a little bit of determination goes a long way.\n\nPureWow Senior Director of Special Projects & Royals, Rachel Bowie, said, \"This one is such a hit in our fam! My son is ocean-obsessed and he loves to watch and call out all the sea creatures he knows. Bruce is of course his favorite, being a Great White Shark and all. My six-year-old loves to gloat about how 'not scared' he is during those scenes!\"\n\n22. Inside Out (2015)\n\nSuitable for: Kids ages 6+\n\nRating: PG\n\nWho's in it: Amy Poehler, Phyllis Smith, Richard Kind, Bill Hader, Lewis Black\n\nRun time: 102 minutes\n\nIn this feel-good Pixar flick, we follow young Riley as she’s uprooted from her childhood home and forced to move to a new city. Her emotions (Joy, Sadness, Anger, Fear and Disgust) try to guide her through this difficult transition but it’s not easy being an 11-year-old girl in a new place.\n\n\"If there's a better explanation of pre-adolescent emotions, I don't want to see it,\" said Quint. \"I weep every time I watch, and I honestly think it helps my kids talk about their feelings.\"\n\nWarner Bros. Studios\n\n23. All The Harry Potter Films (2001 - 2010)\n\nSuitable for: Kids ages 8+\n\nRating: PG\n\nWho's in it: Daniel Radcliffe, Rupert Grint, Emma Watson\n\nRevisiting J.K. Rowling’s magical story of a young wizard fighting against evil Voldemort is one of the best parts of having children. Just kidding (sort of). Read the books first, then snuggle up for multiple weekends of world-class entertainment (there are eight films, plus numerous spin-offs in the works).\n\nCandelario, an avid fan of the franchise, said, \"I still remember getting the books as a child and then falling in love with the movies as a teen. I've been hooked on the films ever since and still watch them whenever it's on TV. I'll probably be in my 80s still mouthing the words like the true Ravenclaw I am!\"\n\n24. Elf (2003)\n\nSuitable for: Kids ages 5+\n\nRating: PG\n\nWho's in it: James Caan, Zooey Deschanel, Mary Steenburgen, Edward Asner\n\nRun time: 90 minutes\n\nIs Elf the best Christmas movie of all time? Quite possibly. Meet Buddy, a man who was raised as an elf in Santa’s workshop. When he ventures away from the North Pole and down to New York City in search of his real father, he’s soon confronted with a harsh reality: His dad is on the naughty list.\n\nCurtis said, \"If you ever need a silly, festive pick me up, this will do the trick. Will Ferrell running loose through the streets of Manhattan dressed as an elf, a sassy and unbothered blonde Zooey Deschanel and Christmas decorations galore?! What’s not to love? Not to mention learning about the 4 main food groups: Candy, candy canes, candy corn and syrup.\"\n\n25. Home Alone (1990)\n\nSuitable for: Kids ages 8+\n\nRating: PG\n\nWho's in it: Macaulay Culkin, Joe Pesci, Daniel Stern\n\nRun time: 103 minutes\n\nWhile the thought of going on vacation and leaving your eight-year-old child behind is totally inconceivable, you’ll be happy the McAllisters accidentally did. This holiday classic (that makes for great viewing all year round) has got plenty of hilarious hijinks to keep the whole family entertained.\n\nMutz said, \"Watching Home Alone with my dad is still one of my favorite childhood memories. Obviously, I remember enjoying it, but the memory of my dad cackling at Harry and Marv getting utterly destroyed by Kevin still makes me smile.\"\n\n26. Matilda (1996)\n\nSuitable for: Kids ages 6+\n\nRating: PG\n\nWho's in it: Danny DeVito, Rhea Perlman, Mara Wilson, Embeth Davidtz\n\nRun time: 98 minutes\n\nThis classic revolves around a telekinetic young girl who uses her newfound powers to defend herself and her pals from the cold-hearted Miss Trunchbull. Meanwhile, she develops a bond with a kind-hearted teacher named Miss Honey. Based on the Roald Dahl book of the same title, this story will teach your kids that with a little encouragement (and a lot of reading), they can accomplish whatever they set their minds to. And who doesn’t want to teach their kids that?\n\n27. Minions (2015)\n\nSuitable for: Kids ages 5+\n\nRating: PG\n\nWho's in it: Steve Carell, Pierre Coffin, Taraji P. Henson, Lucy Lawless\n\nRun time: 91 minutes\n\nHow did the Minions originate? Where did they come from? And how did they first cross paths with Gru? If you've seen Despicable Me, I can assure you, this prequel has loads of answers (and laughs!). Fun fact: Minions was the fifth highest-grossing film of 2015 and the tenth-highest-grossing film of all time.\n\n28. Spirited Away (2001)\n\nSuitable for: Kids ages 8+\n\nRating: PG\n\nWho's in it: Rumi Hiiragi, Miyu Irino, Mari Natsuki\n\nRun time: 125 minutes\n\nStudio Ghibli’s beautiful and surreal animation about a young girl trying to save her family after they’ve all been turned into pigs by an evil witch will captivate young audiences. In fact, you might even enjoy it more than your kids. Believe it or not, Spirited Away made history as Japan’s highest-grossing film of all time, and it held the record for 19 years. Per Time magazine, it surpassed $300 million at the local box office after it was re-released in 2021.\n\n29. Akeelah and the Bee (2006)\n\nSuitable for: Kids ages 10+\n\nRating: PG\n\nWho's in it: Laurence Fishburne, Angela Bassett, Keke Palmer\n\nRun time: 112 minutes\n\nAkeelah and the Bee follows 11-year-old Akeelah as she tries to compete in the National Spelling Bee. This movie is super c-u-t-e and chock-full of important lessons for kids, including how to stand up to peer pressure and how to work hard to achieve your goals. (Not to mention how much it’ll help them with their spelling.)\n\n30. Frozen (2013)\n\nSuitable for: Kids ages 5+\n\nRating: PG\n\nWho's in it: Kristen Bell, Idina Menzel, Josh Gad, Jonathan Groff\n\nRun time: 102 minutes\n\nFact: Every child loves this movie. The sweet story of two sisters living in a perpetual winter, plus the ridiculously catchy songs, will warm your grown-up heart. But the real star of the movie? My favorite snowman, Olaf.\n\nQuint says, \"For better or worse, I know every word of every song, having watched this preschool favorite something like 100 times. And you know what? I don't hate that about myself.\"\n\n31. The Princess Bride (1987)\n\nSuitable for: Kids ages 8+\n\nRating: PG\n\nWho's in it: Cary Elwes, Robin Wright, Mandy Patinkin, Chris Sarandon\n\nRun time: 98 minutes\n\nBefore she ruled on Capitol Hill, Robin Wright starred in this fantasy adventure comedy about a farm girl (Buttercup), her one true love (Westley) and their quest to be together, despite the odds. It’s inconceivable that your family won’t totally love it. (See what I did there?)\n\nWhile speaking with NPR, Cary Elwes, who plays Wesley, explained that the classic was a sleeper hit. He said, \"The film came and did some modest business—respectable, modest, but not the kind of money that they hoped. It wasn't until about almost a decade later when VHS came out that the film found its legs again—from a film that had been mostly dead, it was suddenly alive again. And then it became this huge hit.\"\n\n32. Coco (2017)\n\nSuitable for: Kids ages 6+\n\nRating: PG\n\nWho's in it: Anthony Gonzalez, Gael García Bernal, Benjamin Bratt, Alanna Ubach\n\nRun time: 105 minutes\n\nThis Oscar-winning film follows Miguel on his quest to become an accomplished musician, despite his family’s ban on music. Through a series of unfortunate events, he finds himself in the Land of the Dead where he meets some interesting characters and learns about his family's mysterious past. A thoughtful film that tackles a difficult subject matter beautifully.\n\n33.
