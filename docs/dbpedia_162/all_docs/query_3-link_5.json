For example, a Action movie is in 1.3 genres and the average Adventure movie is in 2.9 genres, so an Action movie is a better defined genre.\n\nBelow are samples of the tables but here is a sql editor with the tables and values in them for reference: https://blazerme.herokuapp.com/queries/new\n\n3 tables:\n\ngenre table:\n\nid name 1 Action 2 Adventure 3 Animation 4 Children's 5 Comedy\n\ngenre_movies table:\n\nid movie_id genre_id 1 1(Toy Story) 3(Animation) 2 1(Toy Story) 4(Children's) 3 1(Toy Story) 5(Comedy) 4 2(GoldenEye) 1(Action) 5 2(GoldenEye) 2(Adventure) 6 2(GoldenEye) 16(Thriller)\n\nmovies table:\n\nid title release_date 1 Toy Story (1995) 1995-01-01 2 GoldenEye (1995) 1995-01-01 3 Four Rooms (1995) 1995-01-01\n\nMy best effort so far is I try to Avg over the count of the genre_id. See below:\n\nSELECT name, AVG(c.count) FROM (SELECT g.name AS name, COUNT(gm.genre_id) AS count FROM genres g INNER JOIN genres_movies gm ON g.id = gm.genre_id INNER JOIN movies m ON m.id = gm.movie_id GROUP BY g.name) c GROUP BY name"
