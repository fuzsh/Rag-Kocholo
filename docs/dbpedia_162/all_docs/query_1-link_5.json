        "text": "Oppenheimer is a movie about the creation of a big, big bomb. So, fittingly, it has a big, big runtime. The film, now streaming exclusively on Peacock, is 3 hours long, making it the longest film that director Christopher Nolan has ever made. Starring Cillian Murphy as J. Robert Oppenheimer, the main scientist behind the creation of the bomb that ended War War II and ushered in a scary new era for mankind, Oppenheimer is a star-studded war drama that packs plenty into those three hours.\n\nNow, three hours is long for a movie, but how does Oppenheimer stack up against some of the other long movies? Turns out, it’s actually closer to a brisk little watch when compared to some truly lengthy films. Here are some of the longest movies ever made, broken down by category, as a straight list of the longest films would consist almost entirely of movies you’ve never heard of.\n\nReally makes the thought of holding your pee when you sit through Oppenhemier’s mere 3-hour runtime seem like no big deal, eh?\n\nHow To Stream Oppenheimer?\n\nOppenheimer is now streaming exclusively on Peacock alongside a slew of behind-the-scenes featurettes.\n\nThe NBCUniversal platform currently offers two monthly subscription plans: Premium ($5.99 a month with ads) and Premium Plus ($11.99 a month with no ads and download access for certain titles). If you're a student, you can enjoy the Premium plan for just $1.99 for an entire year!"
