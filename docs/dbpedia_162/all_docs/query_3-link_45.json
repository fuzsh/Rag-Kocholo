        "text": "While fans wait for Jigsaw's return in Saw XI, they can check out other great horror movies similar to Saw. Every Saw movie follows a clear formula where the Jigsaw killer or his followers place victims in complex, lethal traps, forcing them into intense moral quandaries. While most horror films count on gory kills and sadistic villains, the Saw movies are known for their gruesome deaths that seem straight from someone’s most disturbing nightmares.\n\nWhenever fans discuss torture-based horror movies, the Saw films are often the first to come to mind. Although Saw hasn't pioneered this approach, it undoubtedly made it popular, bringing it into the commercial scene. Most movies like Saw have a little of Saw in them, or they were clear inspirations for James Wan in the first Saw film.\n\nUpdated on July 29, 2024, by Arthur Goyaz:There are ten Saw movies in total, but fans can't get enough of the franchise. With a new installment reportedly in the works, Jigsaw will soon return to terrorize new victims, but until then, horror aficionados can enjoy a range of horror movies that resemble the Saw formula. With that in mind, this list was updated to add fresh recommendations and reflect CBR's most current standards in formatting.\n\n25 House of Wax is an Effects-Driven Slasher\n\nHouse of Wax is made especially for Saw fans who love the second movie, and coincidently, both titles were released in 2005. The film follows a group of teenagers stranded close to a wax museum. They soon discover the place harbors a vicious killer who wants to turn the new visitors into the next exhibit.\n\nThe menacing wax pieces make for a feast of practical effects, a trademark that elevates House of Wax's over-the-top violence. If the brutality of the movie isn't enough to draw comparisons with Saw, the claustrophobic setting controlled by a serial killer will do, making for an anxiety-inducing slasher.\n\n24 Circle Challenges Humanity to Show Their True Colors\n\nDespite how absurd it is, Circle has a straightforward premise—a group of fifty strangers of varying races, ages, and backgrounds wake up in a dimly lit chamber and are instructed to choose one of them to die every 2 minutes. When it becomes clear there will only be one left, each person decides to show their true colors.\n\nCreated by Aaron Hann and Mario Miscione, known for the web series THE VAULT, Circle embraces the limitations of a low budget to craft a single-location thriller driven by dialogue and death. There are all sorts of characters in the movie, and each of them has a choice to express why they deserve to live. Of course, things get complicated given there's a child, a teenage boy, and a pregnant woman on the roster. Just like Saw, Circle delivers an exciting clash of moral values in the face of death, offering plenty of twists and turns.\n\n23 The Loved Ones Delivers a Horrifically Violent Dinner Party\n\nIn The Loved Ones, high school darling Brent innocently turns down Lola's invitation to prom, unaware that Lola and her family are dangerously unhinged. They kidnap Brent and bind him to the dinner table, so Lola can finally have the prom night she's always dreamed about.\n\nThe torture session Brent goes through in the hands of Lola's family is Saw-worthy, and so is his survival instinct. Lola is a character as fascinating as she is evil, and her sadistic ideas fuel The Loved Ones' boiling tension multiple times. Paying homage to torture-porn classics and, most notably, The Texas Chainsaw Massacre, the movie immerses the audience in a chaotic dinner party that gets increasingly violent and unpredictable.\n\n22 The Purge Franchise Turns Society Upside Down\n\nThe Purge franchise sells its concept as a truly advantageous idea: America's overcrowded prisons lead to the government allowing an annual 12-hour period where every crime is permitted with no legal implications. The goal is to reduce the overall crime rate. In this context, an innocent suburban family struggles to survive the so-called Purge when a group of masked criminals break into their home.\n\nBoth Saw and The Purge benefit from a valid point taken to unbelievably violent extremes. The first Purge doesn't explore the full scope of the event, while other franchise entries enjoy the anarchic chaos of its premise to the fullest. The two franchises are long—The Purge is already working on its sixth installment—and take advantage of a clear, yet evolving formula.\n\n21 Knock at the Cabin Sets Up an Impossible Choice\n\nIn every Saw movie, Jigsaw's victims are faced with seemingly impossible choices to survive. The same happens in a much tamer, yet equally hard-hitting movie directed by M. Night Shyamalan—Knock at the Cabin. In the film, a couple and their young daughter have their vacation interrupted by four armed strangers who arrive with a menacing message: the family must sacrifice one of their own, or the world will end.\n\nKnock at the Cabin is far less violent than Saw but is equally intense. Both movies share the contrasting topics of sacrifice and the will to live as their foundation. One relies on a hopeless horror tone to deliver its message, the other is a thriller fueled by faith and forgiveness. These are two recurring themes in Shyamalan movies.\n\n20 Thanksgiving Introduces A New Slasher Villain Taking Down Ungrateful People\n\nIn Eli Roth's Thanksgiving, a new slasher villain emerges on the first anniversary of a Black Friday riot that ended in tragedy. Set in Plymouth, Massachusetts, where the traditional American holiday was born, a Thanksgiving-inspired killer lurks in the shadows, taking down the ungrateful people who stained the city's historical reputation.\n\nThe foundation of the Saw movies is Jigsaw capturing people who don't value life enough and forcing them to contemplate their inner survival instincts. His victims tend to be morally ambiguous people who get one last chance to redeem themselves. There's a thin line separating Jigsaw and Thanksgiving's vicious masked killer, a man of wicked, yet understandable principles determined to come after the privileged portion of the city. Roth's Hostel is usually an obvious recommendation for Saw fans, but Thanksgiving won't disappoint either.\n\n19 Wrong Turn Is An Essential Torture Franchise Worth Binge-Watching\n\nWhen it comes to torture movie series, horror fans will often engage in heated debates about which one is better: Saw or Wrong Turn. Both franchises grew and evolved together, with both Saw and Wrong Turn releasing their first movie in 2003. The latter's premise is centered around a family of cannibals who survive by preying on anyone who crosses their path. When an accidental crash leaves Chris and a group of youngsters stranded in the West Virginia woods, it doesn't take long before they encounter the forest's sinister inhabitants.\n\nThere are seven Wrong Turn movies in total, and just like Saw, each of them follows a distinctive formula centered around the same villains and their methods.Wrong Turn and Saw are determined to test the limits of humanity's instinct for survival. They are two franchises perfect to binge-watch and that will likely stick around for a long time.\n\n18 The Sadness Delivers A Global-Scale Massacre\n\nIt might strike horror aficionados as odd to see a straight-up zombie movie recommended for Saw fans, but the sadistic brutality presented in the film will attract the attention of those looking for movies related to Saw. In the film, a young couple resorts to desperate measures as they try to reunite amid an outbreak that causes people to devour each other.\n\nSaw is all about dissecting the worst of the human soul. Jigsaw acts as a moral reaper, putting at stake the wickedness of his victims in a series of horrifying games. In The Sadness, a mysterious epidemic causes people to release their most obscure desires, which, to no one's surprise, have to do with giving in to their violent impulses. The movie offers plenty of blood-spurting, skull-smashing scenes that aren't made for easily-impressed viewers, delivering some of the best practical effects in recent memory.\n\n17 Speak No Evil Is An Unforgiving Psychological Horror About Relationship Boundaries\n\nSpeak No Evil is the kind of horror movie that hints at something horrible happening at any time but never rushes anything. The film patiently sets up a bloody finale, leaving viewers anxious throughout the entire running time. The movie follows a Danish family visiting a Dutch couple they meet on a holiday. As the getaway weekend progresses, the seemingly welcoming and polite hosts decide to show a more sinister side of themselves.\n\nThe psychological appeal of Saw's early movies is precisely what makes them beloved installments among fans. Each trap sequence in Saw is preceded by an anxiety-inducing build-up that leaves the audience at the edge of their seats. The majority of Speak No Evil unfolds in this same space of suggestive horror between build-up and climax—the hosts spend the entire movie engaging in disturbing psychological games with their guests until things get unexpectedly bloody. Fans of the original movie will be happy to know that Speak No Evil is getting a remake this year, starring James McAvoy in a new villainous role.\n\n16 Terrifier 2 Surpasses The Shocking Level Of Saw's Onscreen Violence\n\nAnyone looking for a gory spectacle finds in the Saw movies a haven. Jigsaw's brutal traps explore the limits of physical pain, and it's not uncommon for its victims to end up with their limbs severed, or worse, dead as a result of a slow, painful process. The only franchise today that goes head-to-head with Saw in terms of graphic violence is Terrifier, which follows a demonic clown going on a killing spree on Halloween night.\n\nThe first Terrifier was already nightmare-inducing enough, but Terrifier 2 reportedly caused people to faint and vomit amid screenings. The movie consists of a 138-minute-long ride into hell on Earth and Art the Clown engages in the most ghastly acts imaginable. The infamous \"room\" scene surpasses the level of violence of any Saw trap, which makes it the goriest option for fans of Jigsaw's legacy.\n\n15 Would You Rather Places Viewers In Its Character's Shoes\n\nMuch like Saw, the underrated horror movieWould You Rather forces people into dangerous situations. The titular game forces players to hurt other contestants by stabbing, electrocuting, drowning, whipping, and shooting them, all for the enjoyment of the sadistic villain. Starring Brittany Snow and horror legend Jeffrey Combs, Would You Rather has a haunting premise and psychological elements similar to the Saw series.\n\nThe primary difference between Would You Rather and Saw is the characters in the former come to their game voluntarily. While they didn’t know the game would be life or death, they each had something to gain if they won. Would You Rather is gripping, gritty, and the perfect film for fans who loved the mystery in Saw.\n\n14 Inhuman Resources Depicts A Harrowing Path Of Revenge\n\nReleased in 2012, Inhuman Resources is just as bloody as any Saw entry. The movie tracks six people who find themselves chained to desks and tasked with proving a former regional manager is innocent of his accused crimes. This former manager, Thomas \"Redd\" Reddman, recently escaped prison and is hell-bent on proving he's innocent.\n\nInhuman Resources eventually reveals that Redd's status as a convicted serial killer has changed him, and he now dishes out painful punishments at the drop of a hat. The film has a captivating storyline and a satisfying ending. Just like Saw, Inhuman Resources provides the audience with many disturbing deaths, tons of suspense, and a bit of mystery to keep them engaged.\n\n13 Headgame Portrays A Terrifying And Deadly Game\n\nHeadgame features a relatively simple but fun premise. Nine people wake up in a warehouse with a camera lens embedded in their foreheads. Only one will survive as they advance through a series of deadly competitions. Similar to Saw, Headgame is also appropriately loaded with suspense and gore.\n\nHeadgame reveals the cameras in the characters' foreheads are for the secret elite society that holds the games. These event organizers are previous game winners who place bets on who they think will be the last standing. Along with this tense story, Headgame features many realistic and disturbing death scenes, making it a worthwhile watch for Saw fans.\n\n12 Hostel Will Make Viewers Reconsider Where They Stay While Traveling\n\nEli Roth's Hostel is part of a harrowing horror trilogy not for the faint of heart. This fun yet hauntingly realistic film provides the blood and gore Saw fans long for—it follows a group of college-aged boys who stay at a hostel in Slovakia. Unfortunately for the boys, they soon discover the titular hostel sells their guests to human traffickers.\n\nHostel depicts the torture in all of its debaucherous glory, which is extremely brutal, especially considering the antagonists' motives. These villains aren't sadistic millionaires or psychologically broken monsters. Instead, they're seemingly regular people who enjoy hurting others. Hostel perfectly suits Saw fans who delighted in that movie's disturbing deaths and overarching narrative.\n\n11 Se7en Remains A Captivating Exploration Of The Mindset Of Serial Killers\n\nDavid Fincher’s Se7ven is a serial killer movie that will keep viewers up at night. The film enjoyed massive popularity in the ‘90s thanks to its tense plot and haunting atmosphere. Starring Brad Pitt, Morgan Freeman, and Gwyneth Paltrow, Se7en follows two detectives investigating a string of murders based on the bible's seven deadly sins.\n\nSe7ven is very influential, and it was a significant inspiration to Saw's creators. The original Saw mirrored Se7en's themed kills and plot twist ending and placed them in Jigsaw's warped world. Although the kills in Se7en are gory, the movie's true horror comes from the shocking reveals and the film's brutal ending.\n\n10 The Collector Is As Gorey As Any Other Horror Film\n\nA lesser-known film, The Collector is perfect for Saw fans who enjoy Jigsaw's creative murders. The film, starring Criminal Minds' Josh Stewart, tracks Arkin, a desperate family man with a seedy past. He is an ex-con who needs money and plans to get it by stealing from his boss. However, when Arkin breaks into his boss' house, he realizes another killer had the same idea.\n\nThe Collector is jam-packed with elaborate, lethal devices that Saw fans will love. Additionally, the movie deals with themes of class, power, and control, just like the Saw movies. On top of these positives, Stewart's incredible performance as Arkin will haunt viewers for days after.\n\n9 The Final Depicts A Bullied High School Student's Gruesome Payback\n\nThe Final is a revenge film about bullied teenagers in high school who decide they want to ruin their harassers' lives, no matter the cost. Using creepy masks that would make Jigsaw proud and terrifyingly creative torture methods, the outcasts take their bullies down one by one.\n\nThe Final may be about high schoolers, but it's an adult watch only. Like Saw, the movie doesn't shy away from violent, bloody horror, depicting multiple forced amputations and disfigurations. While The Final isn't as well-known as many of its compatriots, it's more than worthy of a view for fans of Saw.\n\n8 Final Destination Demonstrates How Almost Anything Can Turn Deadly\n\nFinal Destination flirts with the slasher subgenre and comes from genre icon James Wong and now boasts five installments, each featuring wild kills that grow increasingly fun and creative. Known for its entertaining and elaborate Rube Goldberg-esque death scenes, Final Destination makes viewers terrified of everyday activities.\n\nFinal Destination is about people who weren't supposed to survive a plane crash but managed to fool Death, at least temporarily. Death isn't happy about losing these victims, so it targets them one at a time. For Saw fans who like relentless gore and a high body count, Final Destination is the perfect film.\n\n7 House Of 1000 Corpses Finds Rob Zombie At His Most Brutal\n\nHouse of 1000 Corpses doesn’t have one evil mastermind, specific targets, or terrifying traps, like the Saw movies. Still, Rob Zombie’s feature film debut does have an incredibly brutal premise, intense violence, and crude language.\n\nHouse of 1000 Corpses depicts the Firefly family, who take victims to torture, assault, and eventually kill purely for fun. While audiences may be hesitant to watch House of 1000 Corpses because of its dark premise, Bill Moseley and Rainn Wilson perform brilliantly. Additionally, the movie confuses audiences, so they don't know who to trust or what's coming next, ratcheting up the tension.\n\n6 The Platform Is An Excellent Metaphor For Current-Day Class Divides\n\nThe Platform is a Spanish horror film that shines a light on human behavior and the various conflicts humanity has consistently created. The movie focuses on a prison that houses two inmates on each of its 250 floors. Every day, a giant platform of food descends, and every prisoner must face a life-or-death choice. Afterward, the inmates have two minutes to eat as much as they can, but no food may be left depending on the inmate's level."
