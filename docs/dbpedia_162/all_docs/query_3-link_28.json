        "text": "Updated May 23, 2024: Since introducing our first report, we’ve made important improvements — adding runtime and views (total hours viewed divided by runtime) and separating films and series. This mirrors our weekly Top 10 and Most Popular lists. See our report for the second half of 2023 here.\n\nSince launching our weekly Top 10 and Most Popular lists in 2021, Netflix has provided more information about what people are watching than any other streamer except YouTube. And now we believe it’s time to go further.\n\nStarting today we will publish What We Watched: A Netflix Engagement Report twice a year. This is a comprehensive report of what people watched on Netflix over a six month period1, including:\n\nHours viewed for every title — original and licensed — watched for over 50,000 hours2;\n\nThe premiere date3 for any Netflix TV series or film; and\n\nWhether a title was available globally.\n\nIn total, this report covers more than 18,000 titles — representing 99% of all viewing on Netflix — and nearly 100 billion hours viewed.\n\nOver 60% of Netflix titles released between January and June 2023 appeared on our weekly Top 10 lists. So while this report is broader in scope, the trends reflected in it are very similar to those in the Top 10 lists, including:\n\nThe strength of returning favorites like Ginny & Georgia, Alice in Borderland, The Marked Heart, Outer Banks, You, Queen Charlotte: A Bridgerton Story, XO Kitty and film sequels Murder Mystery 2 and Extraction 2;\n\nThe popularity of new series like The Night Agent, The Diplomat, Beef, The Glory, Alpha Males, FUBAR and Fake Profile, which generate huge audiences and fandoms;\n\nThe size of the audience of our films across every genre including The Mother, Luther: The Fallen Sun, You People, AKA, ¡Que viva México! and Hunger;\n\nThe enthusiasm for non-English stories, which generated 30% of all viewing;\n\nThe staying power of titles on Netflix, which extends well beyond their premieres. All Quiet on the Western Front, for example, debuted in October 2022 and generated 80M hours viewed between January and June; and\n\nThe demand for older, licensed titles, which generates tremendous value for our members and for rights holders.\n\nWhen reading the report it’s important to remember:\n\nSuccess on Netflix comes in all shapes and sizes, and is not determined by hours viewed alone. We have enormously successful movies and TV shows with both lower and higher hours viewed. It’s all about whether a movie or TV show thrilled its audience — and the size of that audience relative to the economics of the title; and\n\nTo compare between titles it’s best to use our weekly Top 10 and Most Popular lists, which take into account run times and premiere dates.\n\nThis is a big step forward for Netflix and our industry. We believe the viewing information in this report — combined with our weekly Top 10 and Most Popular lists — will give creators and our industry deeper insights into our audiences, and what resonates with them.\n\nDownload the report here.\n\nSee below for the video from our call with reporters."
