        "text": "In this edition of The Out Door, we discuss the impossibility of improvisation with Polish composer Zbigniew Karkowski, hike into the varied sonic fields of Maine-based sound-manipulator Jason Lescalleet, and assess Black Metal as depicted in the new book Beyond the Darkness. But first, we explore how long-form music uses time as an instrument.\n\nI: Double Time\n\n__\n\n__ The Dead C. circa early 90s\n\nRecently, my friend Paul Haney wrote on Facebook about Siltbreeze's new reissue of the Dead C.'s 1992 album Harsh 70's Reality: \"This could very well be the greatest album of the 90s.\" This led to discussion of other far-reaching double LPs that might also qualify for that superlative-- Royal Trux's Twin Infinitives, Charalambides' Market Square, Richard Youngs and Simon Wickham-Smith's Lake, and Bardo Pond's Amanita, just to name a few.\n\nBesides being double LPs and coming out in the 90s, those albums have something else in common. The bands made them not to dump out piles of songs, but so they could stretch ideas beyond what one piece of vinyl could handle. Harsh 70's Reality starts with a 23-minute masterpiece called \"Driver UFO\"; the first tracks on both LPs of Market Square hover around 15 minutes; and Lake offers a single song per side, with three lasting 20 minutes. These bands could've stuck to single LP releases and doled out their longer tracks among numerous albums. But the way they approached music-- as a venue for exploration, a place to take chances and be messy rather than restrained or refined-- made the double album the best medium for their expansive ambitions.\n\nThat's true of some of this year's best releases too. On Modern Jester, Aaron Dilloway delves into micro-mutations of noise, and he needs the space of a double album to trace them all. The drones Rachel Evans makes under the name Motion Sickness of Time Travel are always about patience, so it's logical that her best record yet, a self-titled double album, takes 90 minutes to build its sonic structures. Working with extra time pushes Ricardo Dinoso's cycling synths into hallucination territory on Assmiliating the Shadow, out last week on Foxy Digitalis. And it's hard to imagine Swans' profoundly massive The Seer being contained by anything less than a double album. Interestingly, it opens with a masterful 23-minute track-- just like Harsh 70's Reality.\n\nAlbums that last this long, and contain multiple pieces this expansive, make me more aware of time and how it shapes my experience of art. When I listen to a Ramones record, its two-minute songs feel natural-- after all, like most rock fans I grew up on songs that long. But when I listen to \"Driver UFO\", I can feel time's passage-- sometimes it feels fast, sometimes slow, sometimes both at once. And though I never know exactly how long a track's been playing or how much is left, I often find myself guessing about both. This prodding to think about time is part of what makes these double albums so powerful.\n\nCompared to other media, listening to music seems especially affected by time. For instance, it's just a small part of reading, since you can take as long as you want with a book. The weight of pages in your hands can perhaps make you conscious of how much time you'll need, but even that aspect is being lessened by the unmoored, zoom-able \"pages\" of e-books. Visual art is even less about time: You can look at a painting for a second, a minute, or a day, but nothing in the work itself requires any of those options.\n\nMovies are closer to music when it comes to time's influence. Even when I've committed to sitting in a theater with no timepiece for reference, I'm often acutely aware of time, and that colors the events on screen. This is explored in depth by Christian Marclay's recent movie The Clock, in which he spliced together hundreds of movie scenes which refer to time points in their plots. The result is a film that spans a day, both literally-- it actually lasts 24 hours-- and figuratively-- screenings of The Clock start at midnight, and if a scene comes on at 3pm, it is also 3pm in the story of the movie from which the scene was extracted. Not only can you tell how long you've been watching Marclay's film and how much is left, you can't really ever ignore those facts.\n\nThe Clock is more conceptual than any of the double albums above, none of which are actually about time. But there's another aspect to Marclay's film that also fascinates me about expansive double LPs-- as a viewer or a listener, it's impossible to hold these works all in your memory at once. The Clock is an extreme case, since few will even watch it in one sitting, much less remember it all. But even with Swans' The Seer-- which offers beats, riffs, and verses, the kinds of things easily remembered in pop songs-- it's hard to imagine anyone \"knowing\" its two hours by heart. Every time you return to it, you've likely forgotten some part of it, and that part could surprise you-- which makes every listen unique. Which means that sometimes the most interesting art is beyond any one person's grasp. In fact, that might be what makes it interesting.\n\nThat's certainly what fascinates me about one of the longest experimental releases of the year, Jazzfinger's Titan Granolith. This UK-based duo have made gritty long-form drones for over a decade, but they've outdone themselves here, filling two cassettes with three hours of coursing sound, including nine pieces that last over ten minutes. In a way, Jazzfinger are the Ramones of lengthy drone-- I expect every song to be long, and stop worrying about duration soon into each piece. But still, I can't avoid thinking about how time is moving, and how these dense pieces change my perception of that motion.\n\n\"Sometimes, when I'm on tour, moving around from one place to another playing concerts, I'll show up at some venue at 3 p.m. and sound check and wait. Touring is a lot of waiting, and you have no time to sit and do your sounds,\" he laments. \"But I need to make music.\"\n\nWe talked to Karkowski from Tokyo about Nazi symbolism in noise, the impossibility of improvisation and the frustrations of explaining music.\n\nEmbed is unavailable.\n\nPitchfork: You've lived in Poland, California, Tokyo and places throughout Europe, working as an experimental musician. What's the difference between the settings and scenes for someone like yourself in those places?\n\nZbigniew Karkowski: For me, it's very natural. I've been moving around in my life for the last 30 years. I lived in many different countries, and I travel to and play about two or four continents every year. It's just my normal life. I don't think about it too much, but I find that California is full of nerds. It's very nerdy there, where people have internet forums and quarrel with each other what's the best Merzbow record ever. Here it doesn't happen. Merzbow plays for like 10 people, you know?\n\nPitchfork: Your music works with electronic and acoustic sounds to produce something quite different from both. But would you describe your music as electroacoustic?\n\nZK: No. I don't describe my music in any way. I think describing what you're doing is what really kills it. Music for me is a medium for me what exists in a free space. I don't want to explain anything-- like why I do it, what I do.\n\nI really have nothing to say about music. If I could find some way to explain in words what I am doing, I would just put it in words and be done with it. What is interesting to me about music is it's just a different medium. Records are not products for me; they're messages out. All of the records I have should be as cheap as possible. There is a big scene now of heavy vinyl and limited vinyl, and that's a product, a business. I don't think about that at all, ever. I just want to make my music. I do it because I need to do it. I'm working all the time. It's something that I really feel inside of myself.\n\nPitchfork: How early did you begin using computers to make music?\n\nZK: It was in 1984. I was studying composition in Gothenburg in Sweden and then I met this guy who was a computer engineer at Chalmers University in Sweden. We made a record. Actually, he was programming my ideas. I was just giving him my musical ideas, and he was programming them into big computers-- huge computers, like the size of my room here. It took maybe all night to get just a few sounds out of it. When I started working with this guy nearly 30 years ago, I could see incredible potential in the computers. Afterwards, when Apple came with the first Macintosh model, I bought it, maybe the year after, for lots of money. I bought a hard disk, too, of 20 megabytes, maybe. I remember thinking, \"I have all the space to make music for my life.\" [laughs] I still use old computers.\n\n\"If you're talking about pure improvisation,\n\nthen you're talking about freedom. But it doesn't exist.\"\n\nPitchfork: You said in 2010, \"I don't believe in improvisation. I cannot improvise.\" But listening to your music, it's surprising that it's completely composed, that nothing is left up to chance in these pieces.\n\nZK: When I make a record, I have all the time in the world to edit it, to work with material, to get it to the point where I like it. When I play concerts, it's more of a live situation where I do think spontaneously but still I do not improvise because I cannot improvise. I have my own language. I have my own attitude to the sound. Really improvisation does not exist.\n\nLook at all the jazz tradition. They are saying \"We are improvising,\" but it all sounds the same. You have early jazz with Louis Armstrong, then you have be-bop, then you have post be-bop, but it's all just modes. It's not total freedom. If you're talking about pure improvisation, then you're talking about freedom. But it doesn't exist.\n\nOne of the guys I studied with, Iannis Xenakis, he actually said this. Like take a guy that grew up in New York in the '50s and listened to be-bop music all his life and put him on the piano and say improvise, it's going to sound like be-bop. Take the guy from Africa, from the jungle, and tell him to improvise: He will sound like African tribal music. If you take this guy from Africa and you ask him to improvise and he starts sounding like Edgar Varèse or Stockhausen, then this is real improvisation. He's going outside of some total fucking boundaries, but this never happens. And here in Japan there's a lot of noise people and, they're just doing noise. They're not doing anything else but this, and it always sounds the same.\n\nPitchfork: What do you pull from?\n\nZK: I studied composition. I write big pieces, like orchestral pieces and ensemble pieces, and work with analog equipment and synthesizers and computers. It wasn't a conscious way of realizing something. It just happened. When I was a kid, I was really into classical music. Then computers came around, and I started using them. It all merged, but it was nothing really conscious from my side or premeditated. It just happened because it was there. I cannot really tell you I woke up one day and did something new for myself. It's an experience that happened over 30 or 40 years over my life. I mix all my experience in my work, but it's nothing that I do in sort of a conscious way.\n\nPitchfork: Your new record, Nerve Cell_0, mixes those worlds so completely, with the cello seeming to guide the electronics as much as they guide them. How did it come about?\n\nZK: Somebody contacted me from the UK, Richard Whitelaw from the Sound and Music organization. He says he wants to commission piece for me with cello and electronics. I said, \"Yeah, I'll do it.\" They organized a residency for both me and Anton Lukoszevieze, a cellist. We were working at the EMS, the Electronic Music Studio, in Stockholm for the last two years. We created this piece there. I was working with him, recording the little sounds, getting ideas for creating sounds, writing down some sketches for some patterns and things to do. And then we'd have like 3 or 4 hours of materials. I edited it all down in ProTools and made this piece. Is this a good explanation? [laughs] I don't know.\n\n\"For me, collaboration is to meet somebody in person\n\nand be with this person and feel this person's vibrations.\n\nIf I like this person, then I do it.\"\n\nPitchfork: Since the late '90s, you've been collaborating with Tetsuo Furudate in a duo called World As Will, releasing five records. What makes collaborations worthwhile for you?\n\nZK: I met Tetsuo Furudate here in Tokyo in 1995, and we clicked. He is a noise musician but very interested in contemporary music. He basically only listens to contemporary music; his big passion is Messiaen. We started making music and making records and tours, but we never planned anything. There is something new in every collaboration I do. It's never preconceived; it just happens.\n\nI never did collaborations by internet. That seems to me to be a very common thing. People contact me and say, \"Can we do a collaboration? I will send you some files, and you'll do something to it, and you'll send it back to me, and I'll do something to it.\" I think this is total bullshit because it's a remix. I do collaborations only in real time. I have to meet the person. I have to be with the person-- play concerts with him, go to the studio with him, have him sit in my room and bring his gear here. It happens in reality. It never happens by just sending some fucking files over the internet. For me, collaboration is to meet somebody in person and be with this person and feel this person's vibrations. If I like this person, then I do it.\n\nPitchfork: The first World as Will record's always been mildly controversial because it features a swastika on its cover. That iconography is prevalent in noise music and other extreme forms, but what does it mean for you, a Polish native making music in Japan?\n\nZK: Furudate is a really big sake drinker. He drinks like a liter of sake everyday, and he knows all the sake manufacturers. And each record we have made, we use sake labels as a cover. So that cover is a label from sake manufactured in Japan. For Western countries, it's a swastika; but it's a backwards swastika, and the Japanese word for it is manji. It means purity here. If you look at maps in Japan, for instance, all the temples are marked with this swastika. The Japanese author Jun'ichirō Tanizaki wrote a book called Manji, and its cover is this reverse swastika. For World as Will, each cover is based on the label of a sake brand that Furudate likes. It has nothing to do with neo-Nazis.\n\n\"Every time I go to China, I know I will sell one record at the first concert. Then the next day, this record is going to be totally available on the internet for anybody to download. It's great.\"\n\nPitchfork: Your music works at the interaction of acoustic or classical music and electronics. How do you feel about the interaction of music and technology on the other front, as with downloading or streaming?\n\nZK: I have absolutely no problem with downloading. Personally, I don't download. I have too many CDs at home that I can't even listen to all of them. At the same time, I tour a lot in the Third World, like South America, places like China, Thailand, Indonesia. The only way for them to hear some music, like experimental music, is to download it, piracy. Every time I go to China, I know I will sell one record at the first concert. Then the next day, this record is going to be totally available on the internet for anybody to download. It's great.\n\nI know the industry says we are losing, like, I don't know the number-- let's say, 10 billion dollars a year because of the illegal download. But first of all, how can they come up with the number? It's like, \"Hey, we monitor every illegal fucking download in the world. It's minus 10 dollars. Another guy, it's minus 20 dollars.\" It's impossible. So them saying they are losing 10 billion dollars a year on illegal downloads is complete bullshit. The people downloading can't really buy it even if they wanted to. They have no possibilities for it.\n\nPitchfork: Are you dependent on the sale of your music?\n\nZK: I'm not. Of course, this kind of music doesn't sell very much unless something gets pretty hyped up. I actually make my living by touring, by playing concerts live, and commissions. I never make any money from CDs.\n\nFor me personally, my music cost me nothing to make. I even get paid for making it sometimes, like Nerve Cell_0. I release a lot of other things, and I just do it on my computer at home. It cost me only my time and some labor. I don't have to pay for a big studio for productions and things like this. So for me it's perfectly fine that it's free on the internet.\n\nNext: Jason Lescalleet's wide sound world\n\nIII: Jason Lescalleet: Music About Something\n\nPhoto by Yuko Zama\n\n\"It almost ruined my life,\" says Jason Lescalleet about making Road Test, the second disc in his new 2 CD set Songs About Nothing. \"I don't remember how many times I rewrote it-- somewhere between 50 and 100. It was causing sleepless nights. I get obsessed.\" Such attention to detail might not be good for Lescalleet's well-being, but it's made his unique music-- what he calls \"a sound world that occupies a space between noise, contemporary composition, and minimal electronics\"-- consistently compelling.\n\nJason Lescalleet - The Beauty Of Independent Music from Hanson Records on Vimeo.\n\nIn the case of Songs About Nothing, his tireless efforts united two separate projects into a coherent whole. Disc one, dubbed Trophy Tape, consists of 13 highly-varied pieces, most of which hover in the 2-minute range, while Road Test offers an uninterrupted 43-minute journey called \"The Future Belongs to No One.\" When Jon Abbey of Erstwhile Records asked Lescalleet to contribute to his ErstSolo series, Lescalleet gave him early versions of both recordings to choose from. Abbey liked them so much he offered to release them together.\n\n\"People often just make sound for the sake of sound.\n\nMaybe that's OK, but that's not me.\"\n\n\"Since I was working on both simultaneously, it soon became apparent that there would be some overlapping themes,\" Lescalleet explains. One theme is the album's title and cover art, which refer to Big Black's 1987 classic Songs About Fucking. Though Lescalleet likes that record, he insists it wasn't a direct influence on Songs About Nothing. \"[The title] is a parody, but in the classic sense-- the way classical composers use or reference the work of others in their own,\" he says. He also meant the title as a comment on how, in experimental music, \"people often just make sound for the sake of sound. Maybe that's ok-- I'm not knocking other musicians. But that's not me. I fight against that to have a purpose to my music.\"\n\nWhen Lescalleet first encountered experimental music in the Boston area in the 90's, he was a heavy metal fan looking to expand his horizons. One day he walked into RRRecords in Lowell, MA-- unaware that it was a noise music mecca-- and expressed his curiosity to owner Ron Lessard. \"He gave me one of the CDs on his label and said, 'If you like this, come back-- I have a whole store of stuff like it. If you don't like it, throw it away or give it to somebody else,'\" Lescalleet recalls. \"I went out to my car and played the CD, and was completely blown away. I had no idea that that kind of music even existed. That's where it all began.\"\n\nLescalleet returned frequently to RRRecords for Lessard's free Saturday afternoon concerts, where he met musicians such as Howard Stelzer, Greg Kelley, and Chris Cooper. Though Lescalleet had already begun his own musical experimentation, he says he \"wasn't ready for people to hear it right away.\" Instead, he collaborated with Nmperign, Kelley's excellent duo with Bhob Rainey. \"The first time I worked with them it was very easy-- we hit it off and played well together,\" he remembers. \"I thought that's how it would always go, but through further experiments with other people I learned that we had something pretty special.\"\n\n\"I have more reel to reel machines than I can count... I look at my\n\nreel-to-reel collection as a collection of instruments.\"\n\nBut that hasn't kept Lescalleet from trying. Though he moved to Maine in 2001, he's continually collaborated with musicians from Boston and around the world. That includes his work with Lessard (as Due Process), Graham Lambkin, Phill Niblock, and many more. His latest collaboration, with Aaron Dilloway, is called Grapes and Snakes, just released by Berlin label PAN.\n\nEmbed is unavailable.\n\nLescalleet's solo work is also constantly evolving. Though he uses many different instruments and techniques, he has often focused on tape loops (hence his Twitter handle, @tapeloops). \"I have more reel to reel machines than I can count,\" he says. \"They all interpret the sound differently-- some record one way and play back another. I look at my reel-to-reel collection as a collection of instruments.\" In building that collection, he's taken advantage of sounds discovered on old tapes. Once, he unearthed a set of audio letters exchanged by a mother and son in the 1950's. \"I was familiar with that form because my uncle used to communicate to my grandmother that way, and they played their tapes for me,\" he recalls. \"It's very nostalgic for me to use these machines.\"\n\nBut it's telling that, aside from the individual essay credits, no single editor is actually credited for the compilation, at least until Tom Howells takes his nod on the final page. Black Metal suffers from trying to say too much in too few pages and too many voices, so that the various frames never really form a picture. Very deep questions-- black metal's political ties or lack thereof, its emergence toward mainstream prominence in the United States, its occasional overdependence on limited-market gimmicks-- only get surface-level nods, suggesting that there's something more to say but rarely saying it.\n\nBy and large, as soon as Black Metal starts to tell a story, it stops, quicksilvering to another subject with a lack of devotion ill-suited to its objects. The Wire scribe Nick Richardson, for instance, offers perhaps the freshest outlook here by starting to speak about black metal as a style in the truly sartorial sense. He analyzes two Darkthrone music videos to size up the shift's in the scene's look and smartly traces that use of corpse paint and medieval weaponry to now-- Immortal's battle-ready visage, the lupine lineage of Wolves in the Throne Room, Hunter Hunt-Hendrix's conflation of black metal costume with camouflage. He unfortunately stops quits short of his goal, failing to set his parameters for what counts now as part of this fashion or really get beyond facile refills of summaries of Gorgorth's Black Mass or Dead's fascination with his namesake. That happens time and again throughout Black Metal, a collection that feels like little more than a hodgepodge of essays paired with enough full-page photos to appeal to owners of Peter Beste's True Norwegian Black Metal. Overall, it reads like a journal of primary and secondary material, not a definitive statement worth of complementing the narrative in Lords of Chaos.\n\nBlack Metal also fails to address the cultural currency that the form has been allowed in the last several years, whether it's a Ryan Adams poem that talks about listening to the old ghosts while on a plan or how Kentucky band My Morning Jacket turned an examination of the form's ethos into the hook of a major label album's debut single. Pitchfork Editor Brandon Stosuy's essay, originally published in The Believer in 2008 and updated with a prefix here, certainly sets the stage for it, with its explanation of how black metal slowly rose in the U.S. and an always-fascinating appendix that approaches the roughly defined scene as an oral history.\n\nBut Black Metal is only a collection of essays, and it seems to lack the editorial oversight to pursue what might have been its best, at least at length-- how the ideas, ideals or sonics of something so occasionally vile and long-since abandoned by most of its founders somehow find themselves on National Public Radio, in the New York Times or on websites like this. It's approached, sure, as in the fade-into-cliché essay about Thoreau, Emerson and United States Black Metal or the great interview with Aquarius Records co-owner Andee Connors. It's a difficult, possibly impossible question. But with the inclusion of a worthy study of early black metal scenes outside of Norway and a ponderous essay by Nicola Masciandaro called \"Reflections from the Intoxological Crucible,\" Black Metal doesn't seem to shy away from those.\n\nOh, well: Perhaps the volume indeed serves as fodder for a book that dispatches with that wonder at length."
