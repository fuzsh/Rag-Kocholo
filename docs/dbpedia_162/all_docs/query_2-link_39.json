        "text": "WATCH/DOWNLOAD TRAILER\n\nNEW YORK, August 7, 2024 – Shudder, AMC Networks’ premium streaming service for horror, thrillers and the supernatural, today announced the premiere date, and released new images for THE DEMON DISORDER, from special effects master Steven Boyle (THE MATRIX Trilogy, THE HOBBIT Trilogy, KING KONG). The highly anticipated film, which marks Boyle’s feature film directorial debut, stars John Noble (THE LORD OF THE RINGS Trilogy), Charles Cottier, Christian Willis, and Dirk Hunter. THE DEMON DISORDER will make its exclusive streaming debut Friday, September 6 on Shudder and will be available to stream on AMC+.\n\nThe Australian demonic family drama centers on Graham, a man haunted by his past since the death of his father and the estrangement from his two brothers. Jake, the middle brother, contacts Graham claiming that something is horribly wrong: their youngest brother Phillip is possessed by their deceased father. Graham reluctantly agrees to go and see for himself. With the three brothers back together, they soon realize they are unprepared for the forces against them and learn that the sins of their past will not stay hidden. But how do you defeat a presence that knows you inside and out? An anger so powerful it refuses to stay dead?\n\nWritten and directed by Boyle, along with Toby Osborne (PINDAM) as writer, THE DEMON DISORDER is produced by Boyle and Ally Muller and executive produced by Michael Spierig and Peter Spierig.\n\nAbout SHUDDER\n\nAMC Networks’ Shudder is a premium streaming video service, super-serving members with the best selection in genre entertainment, covering horror, thrillers and the supernatural.
