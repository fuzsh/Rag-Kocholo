        "text": "Back during Phases One and Two of the MCU, Marvel Studios produced The Incredible Hulk and Thor: The Dark World, both of which weren't even two hours long. Fast-forward to the present day, where Marvel Studios has proved that they are unafraid to adopt longer runtimes. They have made several films around two and a half hours long, and in 2019, they released a film that clocked in at a whopping three hours. While some films, such as Thor: Love and Thunder, are still reportedly given a runtime mandate, their other films have often crossed the two-hour mark.\n\nWith movie intermissions being a thing of the past, moviegoers have needed to make sure they've used the washroom in advance. The MCU's Phase Four might have come to an end, but there remains lots of ground to cover before the conclusion of The Multiverse Saga. As such, fans shouldn't expect Marvel movies to get shorter soon. Here are the longest films in the MCU, ranked by runtime.\n\nUpdate November 5, 2023: This article has been updated following recent Marvel Studios releases and when you can stream each entry.\n\n10 Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 — 2h 17m\n\nGuardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 clocks in at a little over 2 hours and 15 minutes, making it the tenth-longest MCU movie so far. Part of the reason for the runtime increase is how much the sequel establishes in terms of character development. The sequel to James Gunn's Guardians of the Galaxy introduced Ego and Mantis to the franchise.\n\nViewers learned more about Peter Quill's backstory — both his own time with Yondu and his mother's time with Ego. Gamora and Nebula got a chance to shine, burying the hatchet and turning Nebula from a full-on antagonist to more of a hero alongside her sister. The film also gave Sean Gunn's Kraglin more of a role, and the always adorable Baby Groot has plenty of screen time to enthuse audiences. (Plus, the inclusion of the Sovereign set things up nicely for Vol. 3.)\n\nStream Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 on Disney+.\n\n9 Avengers: Age of Ultron — 2h 21m\n\nAvengers: Age of Ultron is an important film in the MCU. It introduced the Maximoff twins, Wanda and Pietro, along with the character Vision and the evil Ultron. The events of the film directly set up the following film, Captain America: Civil War and the Infinity Stones are further expanded upon, which will become important for the franchise. Because of this, the runtime had to be longer, and it clocks in at 2 hours and 21 minutes.\n\nNotably, the movie could have been longer, but there were many battles behind the scenes regarding runtime as Marvel mandated the Thor subplot with the Infinity Stones, but it was trimmed down quite a bit. All this behind-the-scenes turmoil led to Avengers: Age of Ultron being the lowest Rotten Tomatoes score out of the Avengers movies that have been released so far — it earned 76%, compared to 85% for Infinity War and over 90% for both The Avengers and Endgame.\n\nStream Avengers: Age of Ultron on Disney+.\n\n8 The Avengers — 2h 23m\n\nMarvel Studios made sure that The Avengers had enough breathing room to accomplish everything it set out to do. The crossover film brought six people together from very different worlds, showcasing the formation of Earth's mightiest superhero team. The film was, at that point, the longest MCU film and notably used the extra runtime to delve deeper into the characters and dedicate time to great character interactions while also delivering the biggest spectacle Marvel had up to that time. The extra runtime also allowed the film to dedicate some time to explaining parts of the characters' backstories for audiences who might have missed previous films but jumped right into the main event.\n\nStream The Avengers on Disney+.\n\n7 Captain America: Civil War — 2h 27m\n\nCaptain America: Civil War was indeed a Captain America film but it also doubled as an \"Avengers 2.5. From featuring almost every major MCU character at that time to the introduction of Tom Holland's Spider-Man, Chadwick Boseman's Black Panther, and Daniel Brühl's Baron Zemo, the movie had a lot of ground to cover, and Marvel made sure that the runtime reflected an Avengers level event as it was longer than the previous two entries. It certainly was required viewing as Captain America: Civil War acted as a bridge between Age of Ultron and Infinity War.\n\nStream Captain America: Civil War on Disney+\n\n6 Spider-Man: No Way Home — 2h 28m\n\nRead Our Review\n\nHolland's third Spider-Man film, Spider-Man: No Way Home, was the longest in the MCU Spider-Man trilogy. It was tasked with uniting three generations of Spider-Man, pulling villains from the Multiverse, and continuing Peter Parker's journey of rapid but painful character growth. The creative teams were able to include solid action set pieces, dramatic moments, and plenty of fan service. A near-two-and-a-half hour runtime allowed the film to really emotionally hit home, with Peter learning what it means to be a hero. An extended cut titled Spider-Man: No Way Home - The More Fun Stuff Version added a total of 11 minutes of deleted scenes.\n\nStream Spider-Man: No Way Home on Starz.\n\n5 Avengers: Infinity War — 2h 29m\n\nAvengers: Infinity War was a big promise. Not only was it the third Avengers movie, but it also looked to finally realize Thanos was a major threat after having teased him for years. Combining that with the fact that the film promised to unite a universe, bringing together The Avengers, Spider-Man, Black Panther, Doctor Strange, and the Guardians of the Galaxy all together for the first time was a massive task. Marvel Studios used an almost 2-and-a-half-hour runtime to service all these characters and delivered a massive movie event that audiences went back to see multiple times.\n\nStream Avengers: Infinity War on Disney+\n\n4 Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 — 2h 29m\n\nRead Our Review\n\nThe final film in the Guardians of the Galaxy trilogy clocked in at 2 hours and 29 minutes, tied with Avengers: Endgame. The film needed a runtime to jump back and forth between flashbacks of Rocket's past and the present day, where the Guardians are trying to save Rocket's life while also wrapping up not just the storyline laid out in the previous two movies but also Avengers: Infinity War and Avengers: Endgame. Viewers were introduced to the secondary villain, Adam Warlock (who doesn't stay a villain for long), and the true villain, the High Evolutionary — a terrifying and cruel man who tortured Rocket and his friends (along with countless others) for the sake of finding perfection.\n\nThe film was also chock-full of awesome action scenes, Guardians-typical quips, and amazing needle drops (seriously, the Guardians soundtracks never miss). Despite its length, Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 flies by because viewers are on the edge of their seats the whole time, worried about the fate of the galaxy's best heroes.\n\nStream Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 on Disney+.\n\n3 Eternals — 2h 37m\n\nRead Our Review\n\nCovering thousands of years and jumping throughout various points in time, Eternals was one of Marvel Studios' longest movies. Eternals was a very ambitious film, introducing both the Eternals and the Deviants to the MCU. The Celestial known as \"Arishem the Judge\" was also introduced, who was credited with creating the first Sun and bringing \"light to the universe.\" Even before its release, Eternals was teased as being \"bigger\" than Endgame.\n\nThat turned out to be true, as Eternals went so far as to explore the \"very creation of the Marvel universe itself\" (via SyFy). The Eternals and the Deviants had never been seen before, and were given a hefty runtime for their relationships to be properly explored.\n\nStream Eternals on Disney+.\n\n2 Black Panther: Wakanda Forever — 2h 41m\n\nRead Our Review\n\nBlack Panther: Wakanda Forever has a runtime of 2 hours and 41 minutes. For comparison, the first Black Panther film was 2 hours and 14 minutes. Black Panther: Wakanda Forever is the longest film of Phase Four and the second-longest film in the entire MCU. That should come as no surprise, as the highly-anticipated Black Panther sequel set out to do a lot of things.\n\nIt introduced Ironheart and Namor, who are both expected to have large roles in the MCU's future. Wakanda Forever also paid tribute to Chadwick Boseman while showcasing the journey Shuri goes on to become the new Black Panther. It was a long movie, but one that was worth every second as it allowed audiences a moment to share one last goodbye to a character and actor who were gone too soon.\n\nStream Black Panther: Wakanda Forever on Disney+.\n\n1 Avengers: Endgame — 3h 2m\n\nThe culmination of over ten years of epic storytelling, Avengers: Endgame, was the first, and so far only, MCU film to feature an over three-hour runtime. It used that runtime well, giving many of its characters their shining moments. As the grand finale of The Infinity Saga (technicalities of it being Spider-Man: Far From Home aside), Avengers: Endgame was understandably long.\n\nMost of the film revolved around the Time Heist, which provided an in-universe reason to revisit key moments in the MCU. With Endgame, Marvel demonstrated that big plans and even better execution equals massive success. No other film studio has been able to create a shared universe as successful as the MCU."
