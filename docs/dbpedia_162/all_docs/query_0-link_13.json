This course is helpful in preparing students for the reality of the working environment of the residency programs they will begin after graduation.\n\nObjectives: At the end of this course, students will be able to:\n\nDescribe and analyze the unique roles and skills that health care providers from medicine, nursing, pharmacy, physician assistant, and social work bring to the healthcare team.\n\nApply knowledge of one’s own role and those of other professions to appropriately assess and address the health care needs of patients and to promote and advance the health of populations.\n\nExplain how viewpoints derived from the knowledge base and values of different health care professions can affect patient-care decisions and outcomes.\n\nDemonstrate personal and team attributes that improve or compromise team effectiveness.\n\nCreate team-based care plans for healthcare situations that synthesize available evidence and incorporate multiple perspectives (individual, family, providers); Analyze the strengths and weaknesses of the plan and modify with input from team members.\n\nDemonstrate attitudes, behaviors, and competencies that support communicating effectively when performing interprofessional work in healthcare.\n\nMethods: Team taught, online modules (flipped classroom), active learning; small group discussions and activities; virtual meetings; team-based debriefing and case-based learning. Each student will be assigned to one of the different IPE course groups with students from each discipline evenly divided between the four groups in order to allow for each group to have interprofessional teams. Students will move through the semester in fixed interdisciplinary teams assigned at the beginning of the semester.\n\nThe class will operate in seven modules. The first and last modules will be virtual classroom sessions, covering the same content. Each of the other five modules is an online standalone unit (one is not dependent on another). The order in which these five modules are completed will vary by group. Students will rotate through modules taught by interdisciplinary pairs of faculty located at each of the four schools.\n\nDuring each virtual in-class session, the student will be expected to actively engage with the experience. This involvement will be graded by the faculty leader using a standardized IPE Assessment Rubric. The rubric will appraise the student’s preparation, participation, communication skills, quality of work and professionalism. All rubric grading is final and there are no make-ups days.\n\nA large part of this class focuses on students working on an interprofessional team. These team interactions provide learning opportunities for teamwork skill development for future professional employment. Students will be accountable to their teammates through a peer evaluation system.\n\nRecommended Reading/Resources: There will not be a printed course pack. All materials and weblinks will be posted to Canvas. It is the responsibility of the student to routinely check Canvas and their WSU emails for updates, uploaded assignments and required readings posted by individual faculty. Students must complete required pre-work and will be assessed on acquisition of this knowledge. Pre-work is essential to ensure readiness to participate in class discussion. Accountability for completion of pre-work will be done through quizzes and assignments. Required readings will be available through the Canvas lesson builder pages.\n\nLength: 3 months\n\nClass Meeting Days/Time: Every Tuesday 5:30-7:30 P.M. (synchronous)\n\nAdditional Locations: Synchronous via Zoom and certain Asynchronous modules.\n\nEvaluation: There will be no specific testing over materials presented in this Interprofessional education (IPE) course. Instead, there will be four modules to successfully complete synchronously and asynchronously, two collaborative in-person assignments, and one final team presentation. During the in-person class sessions, faculty will assess students using the standardized IPE assessment rubric posted on Canvas. Grading for in-class assignments will be based on quality and completion. More assignments may be created as the semester progresses. As a result, the weighted percentage of the assignments may change. Students will be notified of any such amendments.\n\nPreceptor(s): Program-specific Course Instructors:\n\nMedical School:\n\nDr. Dennis Tsilimingras*\n\nDr. Diane Levine\n\nDr. Jennifer Mendez\n\nDr. Sarkis Kouyoumjian\n\nCollege of Nursing:\n\nRamona Benkert*\n\nKatherine Balint\n\nSusan Wiers\n\nCollege of Pharmacy & Physician Assistant Studies:\n\nAline Saad\n\nJamie McQueen*\n\nSchool of Social Work:\n\nJoy Swanson Ernst*\n\n*Faculty leads for each school.\n\nDirector: Dr. Dennis Tsilimingras (Medicine)\n\nCategory: Non-Clinical\n\nRecommended Attire: Appropriate for Zoom\n\nEMR System: None\n\nNotes: This is a 4-month elective only offered in the Fall Term.
