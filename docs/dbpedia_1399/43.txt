The Jefferson County Republican Party has nominated former Male High School football coach Bob Redman to run for the Louisville Metro Council District 10 seat this fall. The GOP’s executive committee made the decision at its meeting late Tuesday evening by a voice vote. No other candidate stepped forward for the nomination, according to Louisville GOP chairman Jim Stansbury.

Our young men and women need opportunities. They need proper guidance to develop leadership skills for the challenges they will
