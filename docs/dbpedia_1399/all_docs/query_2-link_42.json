        "text": "Lighting the way to the Future!\n\nAt the Davie Community Foundation we believe generosity changes everything. For the Legacy Circle donors, that generosity lights the way to the future!\n\nSam and Nancy Redman will honor and remember their son Dennis with their planned gift. The Redmans lost their only child at the young age of twenty-seven after a hard fought battle with cancer. Sam and Nancy are “leaving Dennis’ inheritance” to help young people in Davie County further their education through the Dennis Redman Memorial Scholarship that will be established after their death. It will be a lasting tribute to a short but beautiful life.\n\nA Legacy bequest could be the most important gift you ever make to Davie County. It starts with a spark that inspires donors in their living years, and is made timeless by the perpetual Legacy gift that allows it to impact Davie residents for generations to come – lighting the way to the future!\n\nHere’s how: Include your community in your will or estate plan. A gift to the Davie Community Foundation, Inc. (ID # 58-1850531) can establish a fund in your name, add to an existing fund, or support the community at large through the Community Impact Fund. (Click here for sample Will Language)\n\nAnyone can list the Davie Community Foundation as a beneficiary of their 401K, IRA or Insurance Policy without even changing their will.\n\nKen and Angela Craven believe in giving more than they take. Their legacy gift will empower and support the educational efforts and fundamental needs for the future generations of Davie County youth!\n\nAt the Davie Community Foundation, we offer personalized service to ensure the provisions for your future gift are met. Tell us more about the commitment you want to make to Davie County. Contact Jane Simpson; 336-753-6903; jsimpson@daviefoundation.org."
