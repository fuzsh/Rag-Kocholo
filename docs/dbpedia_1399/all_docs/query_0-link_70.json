        "text": "A TPMS can help RVers avoid the dangers of underinflated and overheated tires. By Mark Quasius, F333630 October 2019 RV tires perform best when inflated to the proper air pressure. When tires operate at pressures below what is required to carry their load safely, they overheat, which can lead to catastrophic failure. That’s why every RV should have a tire pressure monitoring system, or TPMS. You can, of course, check tire pressures daily with a quality tire pressure gauge. Those checks should be done in the morning when the tires are cold, because tires heat up when they are driven, which affects the pressure readings. But while this is a good practice, you might still lose pressure while you’re driving, such as when your tire meets a nail. If there’s a slow loss of pressure, the tire will heat up, increasing the possibility of failure. In such cases, a TPMS will detect the drop in pressure.\n\nInternal and external sensors\n\nA number of TPMS kits are available. In general, sensors on each wheel position communicate with a monitor in the cockpit to provide a warning to the driver when a tire falls below a set pressure threshold. Sensors are attached either internally or externally to the wheels and communicate wirelessly with the cockpit monitor. Some companies offer external flow-through sensors, which allow you to inflate the tires without removing the sensors from the valve stems. Many sensors provide tire temperature as well as pressure information. Most systems can monitor a motorhome’s tires as well as the towed vehicle’s tires. If you own a towable RV and your truck is equipped with a factory-installed TPMS, it won’t work with your RV. You’ll need a system designed to monitor the RV. An internal sensor mounts to the inside of the wheel rim and may incorporate its own valve stem. This type is used on virtually all cars and light trucks manufactured today. Some internal sensors are mounted on a large band clamp that wraps around the inside of the wheel. External sensors, which screw onto the outside of existing valve stems, generally don’t interfere with a factory TPMS. External sensors require metal (rigid) valve stems, so if your towed vehicle has rubber valve stems, you must replace them. If you don’t, centrifugal force from the external sensor can flex the valve stem, causing it to leak and eventually fail. Many aftermarket external sensors have a theft-resistant feature, although it’s unclear how many such thefts occur. External sensors can be subject to damage, especially when installed on a vehicle you take off-roading. Internal sensors are inherently theft-proof and damage-resistant, but they have a higher installation cost, because the tires must be removed, and after the sensors are installed, the tires/wheels must be rebalanced. If your vehicle already has a factory-installed TPMS, you won’t be able to use it once you add aftermarket RV sensors. Fortunately, some aftermarket systems allow a second monitor to be placed in the towed vehicle so the aftermarket TPMS can be used when that vehicle is driven away from the motorhome.\n\nTire Temperatures\n\nThe temperature of a properly inflated tire may rise by 20 to 60 degrees Fahrenheit when a vehicle is driven, and that’s normal. However, the temperature of an underinflated tire can be much higher. Inadequate air pressure causes the layers or plies in the tire to flex, creating heat. The tires may overheat to the point where reversion can occur, which returns the rubber to its soft, uncured state. Most aftermarket tire monitoring systems alert users when temperatures reach 160 degrees Fahrenheit to 175 degrees Fahrenheit. When a warning is triggered, you should stop and learn why. Normally, if the rise in temperature is a result of pressure loss, the TPMS will alert you to the pressure problem before the temperature ever approaches a warning level. In such a case, having a TPMS system that monitors temperature is redundant. However, at times other factors can contribute to a serious rise in temperature. In fact, I experienced an incident that underscores the benefits of a TPMS with temperature monitoring. We had just left our campsite in Custer State Park in South Dakota with the motorhome towing our Jeep Wrangler. We had driven about 30 minutes when suddenly the TPMS sounded a warning. I pulled over and found that our Jeep’s rear tires had triggered a temperature alert at 175 degrees. The pneumatic breakaway solenoid had failed on our supplemental braking system, and the air pressure was causing the Jeep’s rear brakes to drag. Without a high-temperature alert, I never would have known, because the air pressure in the tires was fine. Continuing to drive could have overheated the tires to the point of reversion, and they would have failed. It’s also possible the brake fluid could have caught fire. Since then, I have always vowed to have a TPMS with temperature monitoring.\n\nA Sampling Of TPMS Products\n\nAdvantage PressurePro LLC, C13523*\n\n(816) 887-3505 www.advantagepressurepro.com\n\nPulse\n\nSensors: External; can monitor up to five vehicles and up to 80 wheel positions.
