        "text": "Carleton Marchant Hause, Jr., was born November 25, 1939 in Detroit, Michigan to Carleton Sr. and Jeanne Brunner Hause. Having grown up on the shore of Lake Erie with his parents and sister, Marjorie, Carl had an adventurous spirit and enjoyed boating and fishing. He graduated from Eastern Michigan University with a degree in Education. While attending college, Carl met his future bride, Martha Ellen Wenk, and after five brief months of dating, they were married on June 13, 1959. In July of 1961, along with their newborn son Jeffrey, they followed his parents and sister out to San Diego, California where Carl began his teaching career. He continued in the line of educators that started with his great- great- grandmother when he began teaching math at Washington Junior High School in Vista, California. While at Washington, Carl began his legendary coaching career in both track and football. In his first nine years of coaching track, Coach Hause compiled a 63-1 dual meet record.\n\nIn 1965, Carl and Marti added to their family by adopting Kathy. Two years later they adopted Eric and then moved to their current home where they would spend the rest of their lives together. In 1968, with the birth of Michele, their family was complete.\n\nIn 1980, Carl began coaching at Vista High School and in 1984 he was named the head track coach. In addition, Carl also coached JV football and cross-country. In 1987, he left coaching track after 16 years with an overall win-loss record of 105-5 to take the position of Athletic Director at Vista High. He served as Athletic Director until 1997 when he retired after over 40 years of teaching in the district.\n\nIn retirement Carl was as busy as ever, being able to devote more time to his fantasy sports leagues, his love of growing rare fruit, gardening, and reading James Lee Burke and Robert B. Parker novels. He was also an avid game player, loved to research genealogy, and enjoyed morning walks on the beach. Carl's retirement also afforded him time to more deeply pursue his faith journey and love for the Lord. The primary way he lived out his faith was through his membership at King of King's Lutheran Church. There he served as a church council member, financial secretary, Sunday School teacher, Men's Prayer Breakfast leader, and Intern Committee Chairman. During his teaching career, Carl was involved with Sunrise Kiwanis, and in retirement was heavily involved with the Vista Golden K Kiwanis, and their scholarship foundation, where he continued to show his care and concern for students. He also volunteered at Meals with Love.\n\nCarl was very proud of his grandchildren and loved to visit them in New York, Stockton, Napa, Denver and enjoyed being involved in all their activities. Carl loved teaching and coaching as it gave him the opportunity to impact the lives of students and athletes. He was known for his great sense of humor and it gave him a unique ability to break down walls and bring people together in classroom and life situations. Carl was a great man loved by so many.\n\nHe is survived by his wife Marti, his sister Margy, son Jeff and his wife Lori Ann, daughter Kathy and her husband Hal Larsen, son Eric and his wife Mary, daughter Michele and her husband John Houston, and eight grandchildren: Sasha Larsen, Dylan Larsen, Camille Larsen, Madeline Hause, Atticus Hause, Phin Lee Hause, and Sara and Avery Houston. They and scores of students, athletes, and congregation members will miss him dearly.\n\nCarl died from a heart attack on 18 Aug 2014 in Tri-City Medical Center in Oceanside, CA. In lieu of flowers, the family asks that you would donate to Vista Golden K-Kiwanis Foundation, which is a fund for student scholarships, at 14212 Pebble Beach Way, Valley Center, CA 92082 or the King of Kings Memorial Fund.\n\nHe and Marti had the following children:\n\ni. Jeffrey Carleton Hause was born on 7 June 1961 in Ann Arbor, Michigan. Jeff is a writer and social worker living in Napa, California. A true Renaissance man, and an inspiration to his family (all of whom adore him)! He is incredibly handsome, intelligent, witty and engaging, and wrote this bio. He married Lori Ann Dotson in Zion National Forest in Utah, and they have a son, Atticus Lee Hause (b. 2 Aug 2011, see below) in Napa, California, and a daughter, Phin Lee Hause (b. 1 Nov 2013) in Roseville, CA.\n\nii. Kathleen Ellen Hause was born on 12 Aug 1965. After suffering through a childhood dealing with her brother, Jeff, she somehow survived and married Halden Larsen (b. 27 Oct 1964) on 29 June 1985 in Vista, Ca., and they have three children: Sasha Ellen-Marie Larsen (b. 14 Jul 1987), Dylan Jeffrey-Lee Larsen (b. 28 Apr 1990) and Camille Larsen (b. 4 June 1998).\n\niii. Eric Donald Hause was born on 15 Sep 1967 in Oceanside, Ca. He attended Cal State Long Beach, then a seminary school in Colorado and is now a pastor in Ithaca, New York (near Cornell University. Eric married Mary Moonsammy (b. 29 Sep 1966) on 23 Mar 1996 in Bonsall, Ca. They have one child, Madeline Hause (b. 10 Aug 1997) and currently live in the Finger Lake region of New York state, near the last home of William Hause.\n\niv. Michele Marie Hause was born on 14 Sep 1968 in Oceanside, Ca. After a childhood full of torture from Jeff, Kathy and Eric, she decided to make her life's work torturing other children. So she became a teacher, like Carleton Jr., Carleton Sr., and Carlisle before her, and currently lives in San Diego, Ca, with her husband, John Scott Houston, whom she married on 14 Feb 2009 at the House at Thibodo Park, located at 1150 Lupine Hills Road, Vista, CA. They have a daughter, Sarah Houston."
