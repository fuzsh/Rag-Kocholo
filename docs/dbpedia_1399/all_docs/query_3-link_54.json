To be fair, Hogan does also say that Steve Belichick worked hard and became a good coach.\n\nHogan Provides Insight on Belichick’s Sons as Coaches​\n\nPrice asked Hogan an interesting question in terms of what the feeling was initially within the Patriots’ locker room when it came to seeing Belichick’s sons, Steve and Brian, joining the coaching staff.​\n\n​\n\nHogan was honest, with his answer giving a glimpse into how that was viewed initially before the two developed into two respected members of the staff.​\n\n​\n\n“That they got the job because their dad was the coach,” said Hogan about how the players felt. “When Steve was there, he was appointed the safeties coach. Now you’re in a room with Patrick Chung, Duron Harmon, Devin McCourty – Jason McCourty was in there at some point – you have Stephon Gilmore in the DB room, I mean, you had guys, man, that were All-Pro type guys that were now learning from someone who played college lacrosse.

He knew what he was doing. I give him all the credit in the world. He knew it. He knew that he didn’t necessarily belong in that position, probably, at that point in his career. But he didn’t step back from that. He was there, every single day, teaching, whether he was regurgitating whatever coach Belichick was saying, or Matty P when he was there, whatever they needed to do, he did. I think Brian probably falls into that category right now where, does he deserve to be coaching some of these guys? Probably, no, right? But that’s not to say that he’s not going to do what he needs to do and better himself as a coach. He’s there for a reason.”​\n\n​\n\n“Yes, did being Bill’s son help a little bit to keep him there and keep him around? Sure, I’m sure it did. This is a league is a ferris wheel. If you’re in the league and you get in with certain people, you’re going to last, wherever they go. But, Brian’s a smart kid. I’ve been around him. He kind of knows it. He just has to build his own confidence and do his own thing and kind of trust that he knows what he’s talking about.”​\n\nOne thing about being retired from football, you can be brutally honest with your opinions since you are no longer seeking a job.\n\nAny doubts about how negative players felt when Bill Belichick first hired his sons are resolved by Chris Hogan.

It seems like both Belichick kids took their opportunity and ran with it. Now they will have the chance to make their own reputations.\n\nToday in Patriots History\n\nMay 31 Transactions​\n\nMay 31, 2013:\n\nPats waive WR Moe; cut OL Green\n\nThe Patriots waived/injured wide receiver T.J. Moe and released offensive lineman Tyronne Green on Friday, a league source confirmed. In addition, the team had defensive tackle Sedrick Ellis, a former first round pick of the Saints, in for a visit.\n\nThe Patriots waived/injured wide receiver T.J. Moe and released offensive lineman Tyronne Green on Friday, a league source confirmed. In addition, the team had defensive tackle Sedrick Ellis, a former first round pick of the Saints, in for a visit.​\n\n​\n\nMoe was signed as an undrafted free agent this year after a standout career at Missouri. He received the most guaranteed money ($30,000) among the Patriots undrafted rookies this year. It is unclear what the injury he suffered is, as he was on the field for Wednesday's OTA. If he clears waivers, he will revert to injured reserve.​\n\n​\n\nGreene, meanwhile, was signed by the Patriots as a free agent this offseason. He was originally a fourth-round pick of the Chargers in 2009.​\n\n​\n\nEllis was the seventh overall pick in the 2008 draft by the Saints after a stellar career at USC. The 28-year old had 36 tackles for the Saints during the 2012 season. Coincidentally, the Saints traded up to the seventh pick with the Patriots to take Ellis. The Patriots chose Jerod Mayo three slots later.​\n\n​\n\nHe's the second defensive tackle to visit Foxborough in as many days, as Spencer Johnson was in town for a tryout on Thursday.​\n\nThe New England Patriots released former Missouri wide receiver T.J. Moe on Friday. According to multiple reports, Moe – who signed with the Patriots as an undrafted free agent in April – was released under the waived/injured designation, meaning the Patriots can still place him on injured reserve if he clears waivers.​\n\n​\n\nThe Boston Herald reported Moe, who was not available for comment, suffered a torn Achilles in practice this week.​\n\n​\n\nThe Patriots gave the 6-foot, 200-pound Moe – who caught 188 passes for 2,101 yards and 11 touchdowns as an inside receiver at MU – the most guaranteed money of any of their undrafted free agents this April, as he agreed to a deal with a $30,000 in guaranteed base salary and $8,000 signing bonus.​\n\n​\n\nHe was among his position’s top performers at the NFL Combine in the bench press (26 reps), three-cone shuttle (6.53 seconds), 20-yard shuttle (3.96 seconds) and 60-yard shuttle (10.87 seconds). He also posted a 4.74 40-yard dash, which he pared down to around 4.5 at Missouri’s pro day in March.​\n\nUnapologetically Moe, part 1\n\nT.J. Moe talks about Mizzou, what-ifs, and his post-career career. Part one of a two-part conversation.\n\nMay 31, 2001:\n\nPatriots sign veteran free agent wide receivers Charles Johnson and Torrance Small\n\nCharles Johnson was a first round draft pick in 1994, and had spent five seasons in Pittsburgh and two in Philadelphia. With Terry Glenn either suspended or deactivated for most of the 2001 season, Johnson was the number three option at wide receiver - but on a team that rarely used three WR formations, ranking 8th in rush attempts and 24th in pass attempts. Johnson played in 14 games (plus all three playoff games), with 14 receptions and one touchdown in that super bowl season; he also had two receptions in the AFCCG versus Pittsburgh. The Pats released Johnson three weeks after the Silence of the Rams; he spent his final NFL season with the Bills. Over nine NFL seasons Johnson had 354 receptions for 4,606 yards and 24 touchdowns.\n\nTorrance Small was a 31 year old veteran who had averaged 43 receptions and four touchdowns over the previous seven seasons. Part of the revolving door at wide receiver in an attempt to replace Glenn behind Troy Brown and David Patten that year, Small appeared in just three games with four receptions early in the season, for what turned out to be his final stop in the NFL. Over a ten year NFL career Small had similar numbers to Johnson: 346 receptions for 4,602 yards and 33 touchdowns.\n\nMay 31, 2000:\n\nPatriots.com | Patriots hire Jake Hallum as area scout, sign WR/KR Tony Gaiter\n\nThe New England Patriots announced the hiring of Jake Hallum as an area scout today. In another move, the team announced the signing of wide receiver/kick returner Tony Gaiter.​\n\n​\n\nHallum, 61, had been a college scout for the Philadelphia Eagles since June of 1995. Prior to joining the Eagles, he was a regional scout for National Football Scouting from 1992-94. He served as a coach on the collegiate level for 24 years, prior to becoming a scout.​\n\n​\n\nHe began his college coaching career as the head coach of Morehead State (KY) from 1968-71. He then moved onto Maryland and was employed as the Terrapins' offensive line coach from 1972-81. From 1982-89, he served as an assistant at Kentucky. Then in 1990 he began a two-year stint at Arizona State as their offensive line/tight ends coach.​\n\n​\n\nGaiter, 25, re-joins the Patriots after two seasons with the San Diego Chargers. He was signed by the Chargers on Nov. 24, 1998 and played in the final five games of the regular season. He returned 13 punt for 155 yards (11.9 avg.), including a long of 49 yards. He also returned 16 kickoffs for 295 yards (18.4 avg.) with a long of 33. He spent the 1999 preseason with the Chargers, but was released following training camp on Sept. 6, 1999.​\n\n​\n\nThe 5-foot-8-inch, 170-pound wide receiver/kick returner was originally drafted by the Patriots in the sixth round of the 1997 NFL Draft (192nd overall). He spent the first 13 weeks of the season on the practice squad before being activated for the final four games of the season. Gaiter made his NFL debut vs. Indianapolis (11/30/97), but did not record any statistics. He was listed among the Patriots inactives for the final three weeks of the season and both playoff games. He was released following training camp on Aug. 25, 1998. He was resigned on Oct. 22, 1998 and was active but did not play at Miami (10/24). he was released the following week on Oct. 28, 1998.​\n\nJake Hallum - Ourlads' NFL Scouts Hall of Fame\n\nInformation taken from www.clevelandbrowns.com Former NFL scout with National Football Scouting, the Philadelphia Eagles, New England Patriots, and Cleveland Browns Jake Hallum is in his seventh season with the Browns as a senior college scout and is now in his sixth … Continue reading →\n\nHallum served five seasons as a college scout with the New England Patriots, primarily in the Midwest and Southeast.

All three players signed as free agents during the off-season. Neither Norris nor Stallings had played college football since 1986.​\n\nMay 31, 1984:\n\nLincoln, Neb.--Former Nebraska WR Irving Fryar, first player chosen in this year's NFL draft, was fined $150 after pleading no contest to an accusation that he struck a former girlfriend.​\n\nWhile we are on the subject, I would like to share a few comments on the old stadium from a 2020 thread:\n\nToday in Patriots History: Demolition of Foxboro Stadium\n\nToday in Patriots History: Demolition of Foxboro Stadium John Morgan On February 18, 2002 the demolition of Foxboro Stadium commenced. One month earlier the last game at the old stadium occured. Clutch field goals by Adam Vinatieri in a blinding snowstorm resulted in the Patriots defeating...\n\nSupafly:\n\nNice memory. I have a set of cufflinks that are from the last game that I keep meaning to put in some type of display box, but keep forgetting. I think they’d look nice on a shelf somewhere in the home office.\n\nClonamery:\n\nWhat? You don’t have the other goalpost? Would look freakin’ awesome in the “home office.” Cuff links.\n\ndenverpatsfan:\n\nLoved that old stadium. It had character and was loud unlike the new place. I was at the Snow Game. Many fond memories. We bought our seats too. I turned it into a bench for the patio.\n\nFCB02062:\n\nI was there, along with probably many others on this board, and it was an incredible day/night/game. We got to the stadium around 3:30 and it started snowing shortly after, perhaps even as we were unloading my brother's truck to start our tailgate. We had 4 in our usual crew and we each had assigned \"duties\" to unload/setup - one guy assigned to each - the grill, the speakers (set up and connect to car radio), our flag poles (American Flag, Pats Flag, Italian Flag), table/chairs, cooler, etc. This was our 8th or 9th season as season ticket holders, so we had it down to a science by then.\n\nAnyway, as we're unloading the snow starts (iirc), but this I'm sure of - these were some HUGE snowflakes, like so big that you could almost make out their geometric shape. It was not THAT cold out - there've been many other much colder games, and there wasn't much wind. All I remember is those massive snowflakes falling from the darkening Foxboro sky. By mid tailgate we've got accumulating snow in the parking lot (we always tailgated in Lot A, which was south of the stadium).\n\nWe go through our tailgating routines - we drank lots of beer, ate our usual menu of grilled chicken, steak tips, burgers, dogs - basic tailgate fare. And then we'd get our area going as one of us would \"preach\". I don't know how or why we started doing this, but one of our group would stand up on a cooler and basically get everyone's attention and pump up the area. Sometimes we'd burn a shirt or paraphenelia from the other team, but mostly it was just \"The Pats are gonna beat the schitt out of such and such and blah blah blah\" (we were in our early-mid 20s, it was fun, don't judge ). And after our preaching we'd play a song that keeps the area pumped up - usually Song 2 by blur or Machinehead by Bush (very popular high energy tunes at the time) as both made appearances on the in Foxboro stadium game day soundtrack.\n\nBy now it's time to break everything down and load up the truck. We always grabbed a \"roadie\" for the walk into the stadium. At the old stadium you had to walk up a hill (steepness depended on how hammered you were) from Lot A and other lots on the south side of the stadium, and I remember it being quite slippery from the now accumulated snow.\n\nNow we're talking 18 years ago, so some of this may be foggy.\n\nMy seats were in 223, about the 5 or 10 yard line on the Pats sideline closest to the south end zone. IIRC, the game tying drive was going right to left in front of us. When the \"tuck rule\" play happened, and Oakland recovered the ball, many folks in our section got up and left. I sat there in several seconds of disbelief at what just transpired in front of my eyes. I was pissed. I turned to my left and said to my brother as I raised from the bench (bench seats back then) \"let's get the **** outta here.\" And literally just that moment Walt Coleman announced \"the previous play is under review\". I still wanted to leave because there was no way that wasn't a fumble. My brother wanted to stay and hear the call. I agreed to stay. We couldn't believe the call reversal. It was an amazing turn of events. So then they go on and Vinatieri makes the most incredible kick in football history.\n\nPats get the kickoff and now they're moving to the end zone farther away from us. I remember there was a run by Antowain Smith around the right side in which it looked like he might be able to run it in for a td as the play was transpiring. But he got tackled for a 9 or 10 yard gain down inside the Oakland 10. At this point I'm thinking just don't fumble. When Vinatieri made the game winner it was absolute pandemonium - hugging guys you don't know in your section. It was insane.\n\nAfter the game we did some more tailgating, sparked up the grill, drank some more, and my brother and I called our father from the parking lot as we always did. My brother dropped me off at my house maybe around 1 or 1:30 and I remember I watched SportsCenter highlights and commentary until 3 am. I still have the ticket stub from this game.\n\nPatriot Missile:\n\nGood riddance, have some good memories from that place but there is no denying that place was a dump.\n\nHyped:\n\nI won't miss the cold metal benches and the insane lines for the bathroom....hell I even had to pee downhill towards the old race track outside the bathroom through a chainlink fence because my next option was to pee in my pants....\n\nFCB02062:\n\nAnother memory/oddity of the old stadium...\n\nAs we would leave our seats/bench after the game, we'd exit the stadium proper at the first stairway to the runway/walkway abutting the stadium. There was a fence, maybe 6 feet high running along the length of this walkway. On the other side of the fence was a fairly steep hill leading down to the parking lot. Sometimes people would give up waiting to get to the front exit as the throngs left after the game, and they'd hop the fence. Every game someone would be schitfaced and fall off the fence and roll down the hill...\n\nAlso, the back doors to the many of the concessions opened up to this exit walkway...there was this one dude pretty close to the \"end\" of the stadium towards the route 1 side that'd give out papa gino pizzas to passers by. These are the litte \"Junior Gino\" pizzas (IIRC) that they used to sell at the stadium. I was the recipient of several of these through the years...\n\nTunescribe:\n\nMy seats were in sec. 204. The snow was like feathers and piled up vertically on people's heads and shoulders. I remember short catches by Wiggins, Patten and Troy Brown comprising much of the Pats offense while field conditions hindered the explosiveness of Oakland's Jerry Rice and Tim Brown. The trajectory of Vinatieri's game-tying kick was so low and it was snowing so hard we couldn't tell he made it 'til the refs' arms went up. Of course, those were the days before metal detectors at the entry gates: one guy a few rows down from us had two aerosol air horns he held up and blasted whenever Oakland had the ball. I still have a souvenir hat I bought at that game embroidered with the date and team logos.\n\nFree Ted Williams:\n\nI hear they moved those aluminum benches to Gitmo as a tourture device!\n\nI'm pretty sure half of my butt cheek is still attached to one of them.\n\nsean10mm:\n\nThe final game there was legendary, but the place itself was an embarrassing dump. It wasn't even a charming mess, it was just an open septic tank with bleachers that gave children tetanus.\n\nitalian pat patriot:\n\nI know that it was not a fantastic venue but i have to admit i would have loved to see a game or more at the old Foxboro Stadium\n\nToday in Patriots History\n\nLarry Centers​\n\nHappy 56th birthday to Larry Centers\n\nBorn June 1, 1968 in Tatum, Texas\n\nPatriot FB, 2003; uniform #31\n\nSigned as a veteran free agent on July 30, 2003\n\nLarry Centers was one of the best pass receiving backs in the history of pro football. Unfortunately he was 35 years old and had lost a step when he signed with New England, with his primary contribution coming from his still prolific blocking skills. The Pats signed Centers at the start of training camp, and he beat out Patrick Pass and Fred McCrary as the number one fullback to begin the 2003 season.\n\nCenters had 54 yards from scrimmage on five carries and four receptions in the week one 'they hate their coach' loss to Buffalo; that would turn out to be his most statistically productive game of the year. The Patriots cut Centers in order to activate Tully Banta-Cain from PUP after a week six 17-6 victory over the Giants, where he had one carry for a loss of two yards and no receptions on two targets.\n\nThe Pats waived WR J.J. Stokes and re-signed Centers in mid-December for the final three games of the regular season. After the Colts had scored to cut the lead to 15-7 in the AFC Championship Game, Centers had a critical 28-yard catch-and-run that helped set up an Adam Vinatieri field goal and give the Pats an 11-point lead.\n\nCenters retired after earning his first super bowl ring in the championship victory over Carolina. His 827 career receptions is most for any running back in NFL history, and at the time he retired it ranked 7th most in league history. To put that in perspective, Larry Centers has 60 more catches than Marshall Faulk, 203 more than LaDainian Tomlinson, and 240 more than Marcus Allen - all running backs that are members of the Pro Football Hall of Fame known for their pass receiving abilities.\n\nFrom October 24, 1993 to October 20, 2002 Centers caught a pass in an incredible 143 consecutive games. He held the NFL record for most receptions in a season by a running back (101 in 1995) for 19 years (surpassed by Matte Forte with 102 in 2014 and Christian McCaffrey with 107 in 2018), and was the first NFL running back to have 100 receptions in one season. The three-time Pro Bowler from Stephen F Austin State University was at his peak from 1994-96 when he scored 20 touchdowns and racked up 3,390 yards from scrimmage in that three year span.\n\nOver the course of his 14 year NFL career Centers had 827 receptions for 6,797 yards, averaging 8.2 yards per reception with 28 touchdowns. He also ran for 14 TDs, giving him a total of 8,985 yards from scrimmage and 42 touchdowns while averaging 6.2 yards per touch (70th best in NFL history).\n\nLarry Centers signs with Patriots - UPI.com\n\nLarry Centers, the NFL's all-time leader in receptions and receiving yards by a running back, signed Wednesday with the New England Patriots.\n\nWhy Larry Centers should break a barrier for fullbacks in the Hall of Fame\n\nThe Pro Football Hall of Fame hasn't inducted a fullback since 1987. Here's why ex-Patriots fullback Larry Centers should be the one to break the barrier.\n\nNFL Super Bowl Champion Larry Centers pens letter about Miracle For Mom — Miracle for Mom Foundation\n\nLast month, we lost yet another NFL player to the devastating impact of ALS, which is commonly known as Lou Gehrig’s Disease.

Bleier still ranks first in University of Richmond school history in most passing categories. However, his talents were rarely showcased because installing a productive pass offense in such a short time with no veterans was impossible for the coaches of the replacements in '87. Bob is now a financial adviser and active in youth charitable organizations in western New York.\n\nUniversity of Richmond Athletics Hall of Fame\n\nUniversity of Richmond Athletics Hall of Fame\n\nBob Bleier was one of the most prolific passer in Richmond football history. He is first on Richmond's career lists with 1,169 career attempts, 672 completions, 8,057 passing yards and 54 passing touchdowns from 1983-86. Bleier owns three of the top five passing seasons in school history. He was Second Team All-Yankee Conference in 1986 and played in the Blue-Gray Game following that season. Bleier played for the New England Patriots of the National Football League in 1987.​\n\nBonadio director recognized for charitable efforts\n\nBob Bleier, former NFL quarterback, cited for work with Camp Good Days and Special Times.\n\nJ.

He works as a trusted advisor to individuals, as well as small- and middle-market companies in the areas of compensation, benefits planning, estate planning, financial...\n\nPrior to his 28 years in the financial services industry, Bob played professional football with the NFL New England Patriots. In 1991, he was named “The All Time Greatest Quarterback” at the University of Richmond. He has been inducted into three athletic Halls of Fame: Aquinas Institute, NYS Section V, and the University of Richmond. He is a frequent keynote speaker with a number of speaking engagements stressing his lifelong message, “If the opportunity comes, take it; if it doesn’t come, make it”.​\n\nHappy 63rd birthday to Jon Williams\n\nBorn June 1, 1961 in Somerville, New Jersey\n\nPatriot KR/RB, 1984-1985; uniform #44\n\nPats 3rd round (70th overall) selection in the 1984 draft, from Penn State\n\nJon Williams on the field for the Patriots during the 1984 season. He was injured for the next two seasons, but recalls the shift in player thinking following the team’s first playoff win against the New York Jets in 1985. “Ever since then the camaraderie among Patriots players has gotten better and better,” he said.​\n\nJon Williams had a rough childhood: his father was in prison on a murder charge when he was nine, and three of his six siblings wound up being drug addicts. He somehow persevered and was part of a national championship team at Penn State. Unfortunately he blew out his knee his rookie season, and his pro football career lasted only nine games. Since then he has used his life experience to council at risk boys on making the right choices, and now works in sales for Federal Express.\n\nThe Patriot Way\n\nFormer New England Patriots running back Jon Williams was posed the question of whether he could still fit into his No. 44 jersey.\n\nHappy 64th birthday to Cedric Jones\n\nBorn June 1, 1960 in Norfolk, Virginia\n\nPatriot WR, 1982-1990; uniform #83\n\nPats 3rd round (56th overall) selection in the 1982 draft, out of Duke\n\nCedric Jones was a member of the 1985 Patriots team that snapped an 18-gamelosing streak in Miami with a win in the AFC Championship game.​\n\nCedric Jones played in 120 games over nine seasons with the Patriots, scoring 16 touchdowns on 191 receptions for 2,703 yards. At that time he ranked 9th in career franchise receiving yardage (it is 20th now), 9th in receptions (20th) and 10th in TD receptions (22nd). Jones averaged 14.2 yards per reception but did not get a whole lot of passes thrown his way, as he was typically the fourth option after Stanley Morgan, Irving Fryar and RB Tony Collins.\n\nJones did develop a niche as a trusted possession receiver. His best season was in 1989 when he had 48 receptions for 670 yards and six touchdowns. Part of his post-NFL career includes being the athletic director at the New York Athletic Club, catering in part to athletes focusing on the Olympics.\n\nJuly 21, 2014: Patriots.com | Where are they now? - Cedric Jones\n\nJan 8, 2006: Patriots.com - Where are they now?

He played briefly for the Giants in 1959, and the Patriots in their inaugural season.\n\nJoe Biscaha – SportsLifer's Weblog\n\nPosts about Joe Biscaha written by SportsLifer\n\nPlaying in The Original AFL​\n\nBiscaha failed to make the Giants roster in 1960. He was substitute teaching and making about $100 a week when the Boston (now New England) Patriots of the AFL offered him $4,500 for the last month and a half of the season. So Joe played for that first Patriots team in the AFL’s inaugural season, calling the Kenmore Station Hotel on Commonwealth Avenue home.​\n\n​\n\n“The head coach was Lou Saban, a former Cleveland Brown, who seemed to have been influenced in the ‘General George Patton mentality,'” Biscaha recalled, “while my position coach was Mike Holovak, a likable gentleman from the Boston College coaching background. It seemed like most of the players were from a Boston College or Syracuse (1959 championship team) playing pedigree.​\n\n​\n\n“I was being tried out as a wide receiver and needed to learn the skills to compete against the bump and run techniques utilized by the AFL defensive backs. Having played with the Giants as primarily a tight end, those were skills that I never had to acquire.”​\n\n​\n\nIn September of 1961 Biscaha, realizing his playing days were over after a tryout with the New York Titans (now Jets), “signed a teaching contract with the Paterson (NJ) School District for $4,500 for the year and got $400 more to assist in coaching football.”​\n\n​\n\nHis teaching career continued for more than 25 years and was highlighted by three New Jersey State Championship seasons, 1975,1979 and 1980, at Passaic Valley High School, as well as numerous coaching honors. After an eight-year retirement from education, while working in financial services, he returned to serve ten years as a school administrator at Passaic County Technical Institute until his retirement in 2005.​\n\n​\n\nMore than 50 years later, he wonders if his career might have taken a different path if Conerly, the NFL MVP in 1959, had not overthrown him in the end zone. “Had I caught that pass would my life have turned out differently?”​\n\nHappy 32nd birthday to Tony Washington\n\nBorn June 1, 1992 in High Point, NC\n\nPatriot WR, 2017 offseason; uniform #17\n\nSigned as free agent on July 27, 2017\n\nTony Washington during a preseason game between the Patriots and Giants on August 31, 2017 at Gillette Stadium.\n\nThe Appalachian State alum never had a chance, having been designated the cursed number 17 jersey.\n\n​\n\nWashington, 26, signed with New England as a free agent on July 27, 2017.
