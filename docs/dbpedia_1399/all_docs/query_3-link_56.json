        "text": "I am the master of my fate, I am the captain of my soul. During holidays I read Nelson Mandela’s biography and one of the key takeaways was his incredible attitude to face adversity, and never losing faith in a more promising future, throughout his 27 years in Robben Island prison. If you find yourself in 2024 in a challenging situation, are considering giving up on a project or are going through a tough time, here you have one of Mandela´s key strategies to find motivation during tough times, an old Victorian poem. Out of the night that covers me, Black as the pit from pole to pole, I thank whatever gods may be For my unconquerable soul. In the fell clutch of circumstance I have not winced nor cried aloud. Under the bludgeonings of chance My head is bloody, but unbowed. Beyond this place of wrath and tears Looms but the Horror of the shade, And yet the menace of the years Finds and shall find me unafraid. It matters not how strait the gate, How charged with punishments the scroll, I am the master of my fate, I am the captain of my soul. By William Ernest Henley — Enjoyed this tip?

Say \"Thank You Veterans\" by attending a Veterans Day event in your area; 2. Donate to Veteran-Focused charities; 3. Fly a flag - correctly; 4. Ask someone about their Service; 5. Write a letter to say \"thank you veterans;” 6. Don't confuse Veterans Day with Memorial Day; 7. Visit a VA Hospital; 8. Get outdoors with a Veteran. View more details from this helpful list at https://lnkd.in/eWFFcna\n\nHappy Veterans Day to all those who served! Saying thank you to a veteran can be impactful but also a little awkward at times for them. Most veterans are very humble about their service and contributions to our nation. There’s a number of other very impactful things you can also DO for veterans: · Donate to veteran-related charities or causes · Volunteer with veterans’ organizations · Be an open ear to those who may want to share their experiences · Mentor a veteran who may be transitioning into the civilian workforce or trying to enroll in college or a trade · If you are a hiring manager, review your hiring practices to make sure they are inclusive of veterans · Encourage your company to sponsor or partner with veteran focused organizations\n\n\"Ignite Your Passion: Fuel Your Dreams with The Big City of Love\" \"Hey Everyone, it's Ron Spates here from The Big City of Love, and today I want to talk about the power of passion.

I decided to accept a charity bib to run the Boston Marathon. 🏃♀️💨 I wanted to prove to myself that my limitations were directly linked to my mindset... so if I could challenge my mindset, my potential was limitless. I am challenging thoughts like: ▪️I don't belong ▪️I'm not experienced ▪️I don't have enough time to train ▪️I won't raise all the funds for my charity ▪️I won't finish and I'll be embarrassed I wanted to prove that I can erase these negative beliefs in my subconscious mind and replace them with empowering, encouraging beliefs as I start to meet milestones on the way to achieving my goal. 🪄 Today, I ran 18 miles, which is my biggest achievement to date! 🙌 I've made the time to train ✔️ I've gained experienced along the way ✔️ Slowly, my mind is shifting and I'm beginning to believe I DO belong ✔️ Although running a marathon is a personal goal, the lessons learned translate into my professional development. I'm testing my mental toughness and challenging my limits. I've erased most of the negative thoughts from my subconscious but one doubt remains... will I be able to raise the required funds for my charity? I've raised about $5,000 for the Boston Police Foundation but I have to raise $5,000 more in the next 60 days. I'm stepping outside of my comfort zone and asking my professional network for some help. Will you donate to my charity to help me reach my goal? Do you have any big, scary, goals that you're working on? Remember, if you know how to accomplish a goal, it probably isn't big enough! Get out there and slay some dragons! I'd love to help support you along the way! #goalsetting #goalsmatter #growthmindset #professionaldevelopment\n\n“Let’s swap out the tires on our semi-truck that we use for food distribution with bicycle tires. We’ll save a ton of money.” “Addiction counselors are expensive. I built a career on talking to people in my insurance business. I can do that counseling work for 1/3 the cost of a counselor.” “We’ve decided not to fund any cancer research scientists next year. We’re taking that in-house to save money.” “My neighbor paints houses. I can get him to do the art restoration for the museum. We’ll get a great deal on this!” Do we all agree these are TERRIBLE ideas? No nonprofit or their board would make such horrible decisions. That’s because they understand these would result in catastrophic results for their organization. The same organizations and board members wouldn’t think twice about making this exact decision with their fundraising. The short-sighted goal of cost containment causes orgs and well meaning (but misinformed) boards to assume they have the knowledge and expertise to successfully execute complicated fundraising strategies. The unfortunate result in almost every case like this is DECREASED mission impact. So you need to ask...is my purpose cost containment or mission impact? If it’s the latter, act accordingly... #nonprofit #abetterway #fundraising #philanthropy #badideas #boards #investment #strategy #decisionmaking #impact\n\nOn the morning of May 6, 1954, British athlete Sir Roger Bannister did the impossible and became the first person to run a mile in under four minutes. Prior to this it was thought to be humanly impossible. We have a tendency to need proof in order to shift our beliefs. When we see someone else do something that seemed impossible, the door of possibility opens. This is always a mental door. In reality all things are possible; but we wait for proof to show up before venturing forward. The book Live. Love. Prosper: A positive mindset can make anything possible is a collection of short stories by real people - Authors Who Care. Thirty stories of triumph. Thirty different impossible situations. Thirty success stories. Thirty demonstrations of proof that when you shift your mindset, your life changes. The authors have agreed to use the book as a fundraiser - donating 100% royalties to charities in their home towns. Thirty charities that will benefit. I live in a small town called Oshawa. I am supporting the YWCA Women's shelter in my town. Your purchase of the book using the link below will direct CAD15 to this cause. Your attending the Open House in person on Dec 7th at Adelaide House, Oshawa @6pm, to purchase a book will direct $20 towards the shelter. Who do you know that might love a collection of inspiring stories? Who do you know that needs a little bit of proof that things do work out, and that all things are possible? Who do you know that has a generous heart and a giving spirit, especially this holiday season?\n\nWell done, Mark; nothing stops you! Mark's resilience knows no bounds.
