        "text": "With a recent bevy of new offers and commitments, I'm updating my previous Hawaii Recruiting Report, and I'm adding some of my other notes on other non-Hawaii recruits.\n\nAs always, please rec and leave your questions, comments, and other ideas for articles below. I always love chatting with my fellow UWDP readers.\n\nCommits\n\nUpdate (5/12) Ethan Garbers (QB, 6'2\" 190) Garbers is the foundation of our 2020 recruiting class, and he is a classic Petersen QB find. Originally offered and committing as a 3* QB, Garbers was a gem that we found early in the recruiting cycle, and that early offer paid dividends for us. Garbers is a pocket passer with a live arm. He has consistently shown the ability to take deep shots with both zip and touch. He knows how to move within the pocket, and he has consistently shown the ability to move, reset, and read through his second and third options. He's the latest QB in our transition towards more elite talent at QB and different styles. His arm isn't quite on the level of Eason, but his comfort in the vertical passing game is a departure from Browning's more horizontally oriented style at UW. Whether that is a product of their individual systems or their true tendencies, it will be interesting to see if this difference between past and future UW QBs is a signal that we want to reemphasize the vertical game. Garbers's help as a Kalepo-type recruiting ambassador may also prove to be critical in the formation of our 2020 class. He is a prospect that I am very excited to see in the future.\n\nUpdate (5/12) Gaard Memmelaar (OL, 6'4\" 290) Memmelaar looks like a real find coming out of Idaho. He looks like a man among boys in HS, but his traits look impressive even in a vacuum. He has nice burst off the snap, and he plays with the mean streak that you are looking for from an offensive lineman. He seems to relish burying opponents. He has a good motor, foot speed, and power. He looks to be able to play at 300+ lbs in college, but his length seems to be a little less than what we usually look for in OTs. We've recruited shorter OTs in the past (Fautanu), but they were more athletic and had potential on the iOL too. I can see Memmelaar kicking inside as a high upside iOL at UW. He is more of a development and depth player than an instant impact type, but that is what we were looking for considering how deep and experienced we are at OL in 2019.\n\nUpdate (5/12) Mark Redman (TE, 6'6\" 250) Redman has prototypical size and good hands. He seems to have a good feel for getting open on short routes against zone, as well as enough speed to be a decent threat down the seams. His film doesn’t show too many examples of 50/50 ball receptions, but he does have a few plays where he made the reception in traffic and secured the ball through contact, so I’m confident in his ability to win contested catch situations. He’s definitely not a TE in the mold of Bryant, who really is just a big WR, and he doesn’t seem to show a lot of RAC type of ability, but his usage in his HS blocking scheme should translate well. He is a high-effort blocker, but based on his junior film he needs to work on his footwork and blocking technique to make up for his relatively thin frame. His hudl lists him at 6-5, 220 lbs, but 247 has him at 6-6, 250 lbs, and his recent commitment photos make him look much larger than 220. It’ll be interesting to see how his added weight will translate to both his blocking and route running. If he does end up arriving in the program around 6-5 ~250 lbs, then I wouldn’t be surprised if he contends for early game time, but assuming Kizer, Otton and our other TEs can hold down the fort in 2020, Redman should use a redshirt year to add more strength and power to his game. If so, he should be the next in our long line of successful TEs. He has more upside as a receiver than Dissly and Sample, but will likely spend 50-75% of his snaps attached to the line like they did. I think he projects most similarly to Cade Otton as a well-rounded conventional Y-TE. He isn’t as fluid an athlete as Otton, but their overall athleticism and skill sets are close enough to use his progression as a template.\n\nTargets with Offers\n\nUpdate (5/12) Jalen McMillan (WR, 6'2\" 181) McMillan is a prototypical do-everything WR. A real blue-chip WR, McMillan has no glaring flaws that I can see on his tape. Granted, hudl is filled with highlights, but his tape shows that he at least has the ability to do everything that you would want in a WR. As his team's WR1, McMillan showed a whole host of skills that you want to see in a young WR. He didn't just out-athlete the competition (although he certainly could). McMillan showed ability to win a clean release of the LOS, create separation deep against off-coverage, win on jump balls, make plays as a catch-and-run home run threat, and make catches through contact. He also showed great effort as a downfield blocker, which is a point of emphasis with Coach Adams. His deep speed looks solid in his kick return film (kick returners are often the fastest sprinters on the team). I don't know how many Pac-12 DBs he will run away from, but he certainly has the speed to compete and the technique to win. At his size and with his skill set, I think he could play from any receiver alignment for us with inside/outside versatility. His strong hands, route running, and ball tracking would make him a dangerous deep threat from the perimeter, but his fearlessness could make him a strong seam threat from the slot. He's probably one of our top WR targets, and for good reason.\n\nUpdate (5/12) Gary Bryant Jr. (WR, 5'10\" 163) Bryant is a real burner. Plain and simple. He has an extra gear that many of his opponents didn't have. It wasn't just speed, though. Bryant is both fast and quick. His shiftiness and vision on punt returns were really enticing. The best punt returners are often known for being quicker than fast, and this has proven a good indicator of slot receiver traits. Being that Bryant has home-run speed and quickness, I could see him being a tremendous threat in the mold of John Ross. Ross had the skills to play as a perimeter WR, but he was also able to fill the Chico role as a catch-and-run player on screens. Having player like that in the slot, one that can threaten seams, soft coverage, and as a runner, while also not getting pegged as a slot-only player, would be a fantastic complement to our TE-heavy offensive packages.\n\nUpdate (5/12) Myles Murao (iOL, 6'3\" 270) Murao is the latest OL recruit to come out of Mater Dei. I've always liked the level of technical proficiency that Mater Dei OL had. Murao played at OT for the Monarchs, but is being projected to the interior offensive line at the college level. He has the mean streak that you look for in all OL, and he has a quick pass set and light feet for a future iOL. He is a \"finisher\" in the run game, and he consistently gets people on the ground. He was asked to do a variety of things that our best OL have been able to do (blocks at the second level, pull, 1v1 pass protection on the edge), and I think he has the athletic ability to be a very solid pass protector. The one thing I'd need to see is if he can add significant functional strength in the lower body. He moves like a smaller athlete, but sometimes that shows when taking bull rushes and in the run game. He has good upper body strength, as shown by his pancakes often being a product of \"legal holds\" and throws rather than head-to-head mauling, but he sometimes struggles against similarly sized players who want to win with power. Murao could very easily be a higher-end Nick Harris given his athleticism and potential to reach the 300-310 lb range.\n\nUpdate (5/12) Daniyel Ngata (APB, 5'9\" 180) Yet another Ngata that we're in the mix for. He has great vision and hands for a \"Do-Everything\" player for his team. While his long speed is decent, I don't see him as a true burner. Where he separates himself is that he gets to his top speed very quickly and can make breaks/cuts without losing much speed. While his primary position has been RB, his film shows that he has good hands both at the LOS and deep down the field. He hasn't been asked to run very many routes, but his shiftiness as a running back suggests that he has the agility to develop in that area. Given our history in recruiting what 247 deems to be APBs, I think that there is a good chance that Ngata converts to WR to play the Chico-role like McClatcher and Trey Lowe have (both being former APB recruits). Converting would also mitigate any concern regarding his smaller size, although McGrew (our other former APB recruit) has managed to stick at RB despite being roughly Ngata's size.\n\nUpdate (5/12) Xavier Carlton (DL, 6'7\" 262) Carlton is someone who I’d really be intrigued by. We haven’t really had a player like him under Coach Pete. He is an extremely long DL, measuring in at 6’7\". While only weighing in at 250 lbs, he plays with surprising power and athleticism. He seems to really know how to leverage his length to shed blocks, and has real closing speed. DeForest Buckner really jumps out as a comparison. I know Buckner was a Duck, but I watched him since he was playing at my old HS in Hawaii. Buckner was an athletic 6’7\" 230 lbs as a senior, but played with speed and power. He bulked up to +270 lbs during his redshirt year and eventually played in the 290 to 300-lb range while being a menace on the interior DL. I could see Carlton being a transcendent talent in Levi’s current spot next to a NT by bringing length that we haven’t seen at the position before. Carlton is a touted recruit at this point, and I wouldn't hold my breath on us getting his commitment.\n\nUpdate (5/12) Jake Shipley (DL, 6'4\" 250) Shipley seems to be on the \"project\" end of the recruit spectrum with nice upside, but likely needs at least a year of development before seeing the field. I don’t really see him being pure Edge-type or NT-type, but if we played him right over an OT or OG he might be able to do some real damage when paired with an NT. Shipley has nice burst and a better pop than his size would suggest. Stylistically, he could end up as a Jack OLB/DL like Potoa’e has been until recently. He is roughly the same size as ZTF, but has spent more time with his hand down as a true DE than ZTF had in HS.\n\nUpdate (5/12) Noah Nelson (OT, 6'8\" 295) Nelson is another OT with incredible length, as he is one of our five offered OT targets that is 6'7\" or taller. At this point it seems like we have a clear preference for length among our OL recruits. Nelson has really nice movement skills and power in the run game. His tape shows both the ability to collapse the end of the DL and the ability to seal the edge on outside zone plays. He didn't have very many pass protection plays on his hudl tape, but his footwork doesn't look nearly as polished in his pass protection as it does in the run game. The length and athleticism are there to become a good pass protector, but it will be a work in progress. 247 predicts that he will land at Michigan, but he is the only OT prospect that we have offered that we are still in the mix for right now. There is a chance that we get a recruiting bump at some point because we are also battling Michigan for Jeffrey Persi, another OT with similar measurables.\n\nUpdate (5/12) Trey Paster (ATH, 6'3\" 200) At 6’3\", Paster looks like the type of CB that could step in and provide length against tall matchups, like Taylor. He has good ball skills for a DB (he also plays WR), and he plays with physicality, routinely attacking the ball carrier in the run game and teeing off on underneath receivers. His run support relies more on effort than quality tackle form, and he needs to refine his tackling and pursuit angles. However, in coverage, Paster doesn’t look very fluid with his hips. He can turn and run on vertical routes, but his tape doesn’t show many coverage plays that aren’t vertical routes or one-break routes where he has to dislodge the ball rather than make a play on it. Because of this I see him as a pure outside CB prospect, unlike some of our past DB recruits who had Safety, CB, and Slot Corner versatility. He has quite a few Pac-12 offers, so it might be a fight to secure his commitment.\n\nUpdate (5/12) Blake Smith (TE, 6'4\" 247) Smith is an intriguing TE prospect. From what I have found on his 247 and hudl pages, he is a former QB that has only played one year of TE. His blocking looks like he’s a recent QB-TE convert, but the effort is definitely there. At 6’5\" and 235+ lbs, Smith looks like a TE in the making. He is a fluid athlete with good speed and hands. He isn’t very quick, but he has good long speed to challenge the seams and deeper parts of the field. It sounds like there is real momentum building in his recruitment, but it also sounds like the UW offer is standing out from the crowd right now. Given Bryant’s likely early departure, we might be looking to bring in a second TE to go along with Redman, but we wouldn’t be in any trouble without Smith.\n\nUpdate (5/12) Cooper McDonald (OLB, 6'3\" 220) McDonald looks like a really nice OLB. At 6’3\" and 220 lbs (his hudl says 205 lbs and he looks skinny on tape), McDonald could be the LB that we’ve been looking for. If he’s bulked up to a legit 220 lbs, he would be a fit at either X LB or one of our ILB spots. He currently plays as a hybrid OLB position that has him both on-ball, like our Jack LB, and off the LOS, like our X LB. His pass rush film just pops off the screen with his physicality and burst, almost on par with Botelho while at a light playing weight, and he looks like he has the awareness and athleticism to be a playmaker in the flats. While I might not ask him to play man coverage against a TE up the seam, he shouldn’t be a liability in coverage. I might be as high on McDonald as I am on Herbig, and both project very similarly in our scheme. I don’t know if he is a backup plan to Herbig, but we might be in a better position to be an early leader on McDonald. He hasn’t been heavily recruited by P5 teams yet, and being an early arrival in his recruitment might pay dividends. If both Herbig and McDonald want to commit, I wouldn’t turn either down.\n\nUpdate (5/12) Fa’aope Laloulu (OT, 6’7\" 340), \"Ope\" was a Hawaii recruit that I had noted in my last recruiting breakdown as someone we may have to keep an eye on, and he has received one of our six OT offers. He had offers from USC, Oregon, and Arizona, but at the time hadn't picked up national recruiting momentum as he played for a small school in the lowest HS division in Hawaii. He is one of those \"man-child\" types dating back to intermediate football when he was 6’4\" 300+ in eighth grade. Doesn’t have the basketball-type lateral agility that elite LT prospects exhibit, but is definitely fluid enough to warrant interest as a OT. I’d give him an Orlando Brown Jr. comparison as a huge OT type that doesn’t exhibit movement athleticism, but proper technique could allow him to utilize raw power and length to compensate. UW’s Built for Life program mantra and academic rigor aren’t likely to be great selling points from what I have heard, but athletic fit would be similar to 2019’s Julius Buelow. A new development to watch is the closure of his HS at the end of the 2019 academic year. He has expressed interest in transferring to St. Louis HS where he'd likely get national attention playing with Botelho and Herbig.\n\nNick Herbig (OLB, 6'2\", 215 lbs)\n\nUpdate (5/12): We still seem to be in the mix for Herbig.\n\nHonestly, for college projection sake, I’d be a bit more I can see more potential in Herbig. He plays the \"Bartlett\" off the ball in his HS defense. He plays the majority of his snaps off the LOS, but he has experience on the LOS as an edge rusher when they use a more traditional 3-4 front with both OLBs on the LOS.\n\nI like his film as a flats defender, and he shows anticipation of passing lanes. He is a fluid mover with upside as an OLB. The only concern at this point is if he will be able to maintain weight at the D1 level. He’s hovering around 200 lbs, which is concerning if he were to stay at LB full time, but he does have the athleticism and instincts to compensate for a lack of size. Given our depth at DT/DL, and our willingness to play a quasi 3-DL front with Jaylen Johnson, there's a chance that we start to migrate toward full-time base 3-3-5 personnel packages that align more like a 4-man front. This would allow us to get more 2-gapping DL on the field to protect smaller LBs like Herbig. Thus, from a fit perspective, Herbig might be easier to project into our defense from a skills and scheme perspective than Botelho, albeit with less athletic upside.\n\nPlayers We May Not Get\n\nJordan Botelho (OLB, 6'3\", 225 lbs)\n\nUpdate (5/12): Botelho verbally committed to Notre Dame. While we might still have a shot at flipping that commitment, I think we are moving on to other prospects.\n\nI’ve seen him play a couple of times over the last two years. He’s a good athlete with size and a physical style of play. He currently plays as a hybrid DE/OLB, BUCK-type, in his HS 3-4 scheme, and he rushes the passer or aligns on the edge of the LOS at least 2/3 of the time. He has speed to beat slower tackles and power to overwhelm RBs. I’d say he doesn’t have a well-developed repertoire of pass rush moves beyond the speed rush and bull rush, but his instincts in the run defense and shooting gaps should benefit his development as a pass rusher.\n\nThe tricky part about fitting his skill set into our scheme is that his best traits are his pass rush skills and downhill tackling, but he doesn’t have the build at this point to man our BUCK position. This isn’t for lack of trying to bulk up. He’s added lean muscle mass every year that I’ve been following his HS career, but he just isn’t going to ever fill out like Tryon or Mathis. He’s pretty close to his ideal size in my opinion, and he could slot in at Tevis Bartlett’s old off-the-ball OLB position from before Wellington got hurt, but then you get into the question regarding his coverage ability. He has no really proven ability to cover in man or zone at this point, so projecting him to that position would be a real stretch. However, I think this is likely where he ends up. I’d watch the development of his coverage skills closely.\n\nAlternatively, he could slot into the less coverage-intensive of the two ILB spots, but we already have a logjam at that position so that doesn’t seem likely.\n\nOther Names to Keep an Eye on\n\n-Update (5/12) Roman Wilson (WR, 6' 175), Wilson is a late-blooming speedster that is starting to make waves on the recruiting scene. I looked for his Sparq combine breakdown, and his 4.37 laser-timed 40 and 39\" vertical back up his reputation. I’ve been a regular at St. Louis games since my HS plays them several times a year, and he played against one of the teams that I coached a couple of years ago. He was a generous 5’10\" 150 lbs last year, so him measuring in at 6’ 175 lbs is a really positive sign for his college prospects. I’d compare him to Baccellia as a smaller speedster that has speed/explosiveness to eat up cushion coverage, but doesn’t always run by players. Both use their speed to get DBs on their back foot before making breaks and turning plays into catch-and-run foot races. That’s not to say that he can’t beat people on a go route, but he’s more familiar with the Run N’ Shoot route combos that make use of switch routes and breaking routes. Probably a tier 2 or tier 3 priority recruit, although I've heard that UW coaches have him on their radar.\n\n-Update (5/12) Matt Sykes (WR, 6'4\" 210), Sykes was the more highly touted of the two St. Louis receivers (Sykes and Wilson) in the local football scene. He always had the size/speed combination growing up (IIRC he was 6’1\" 180 lbs as a freshman), and he had the speed/physicality/hands to play as the X-WR at every level. Now at 6’4\" 210 lbs, Sykes has all of the physical tools to be a high end P5 WR. His Sparq numbers cumulatively look great (119.88 Sparq score), but if you break down his combine numbers they don’t look great (4.72s 40 and 37\" vert). Don’t be alarmed by the 40 time; Sykes is actually coming back from a nasty broken leg that sidelined him for almost his entire junior season (which also explains his lack of tape for those of you who are concerned). Once healthy, I’d guess that he runs in the 4.5-4.6 range. Probably a tier 2 or 3 priority recruit, as well.\n\n-Update (5/12) Stanley McKenzie (DT, 6'2\" 270), McKenzie was a man among boys all the way back in sixth grade when he was pushing 6’ tall at 11-12 years old. He hasn’t grown much taller since then, probably measuring in at a legit 6’2\", but he has developed great natural strength and a good burst for a pure NT/DT prospect. Stylistically he plays like Gaines at NT with the ability to anchor against double teams, collapse the pocket in 1v1s, and has enough wiggle to beat lead-footed OGs or centers who are bracing for the bull rush. If we were to pursue him, he’d probably need a redshirt year at UW to lean out and add muscle mass since he weighs in at a relatively maxed-out 270 lbs. Realistically, getting over 300 lbs might be a stretch considering his frame, and getting him there might limit his ceiling to being somewhere in between a slower/stouter Onwuzurike and a smaller/quicker Gaines, but only if he were to maximize his physical tools over 4-5 years in college. McKenzie might be a good prospect for us if we decide to target a \"diamond-in-the-rough\" DL later in this recruiting cycle. We have a bunch of 2018 and 2019 DTs that are likely early impact players, and given the slim pickings in the West, we might be in a position to take 1-2 \"project\" and depth guys if we strike out on the blue chippers. McKenzie might not be able to play every DL position we have, but he could be a solid Pac-12 caliber NT for whom we wouldn’t necessarily need to beat out a host of schools.\n\nKaonohi Kaniho (DB, 5’10\" 160) Kaniho’s brother Kaula is a stud DB for Boise State after coming out of Kahuku HS and Kaonohi exhibits the same ball hawking and feel for coverage. While he is a middling 3-star recruit, he has a strong HS pedigree and might be in the running for a preferred walk-on spot with Myles Bryant upside. His strong fundamentals, athleticism, football IQ, and willingness to contribute on special teams would make him an ideal candidate. He is teammates with Ah You, which might be a selling point if we deem him a recruit worth pursuing."
