        "text": "Theoretical model and hypothesis development\n\nCoach-athlete relationships have been defined as an interconnection of emotions, thoughts and behaviours (Jowett and Ntoumanis 2003). The coach-athlete relationship is intentionally developed through appreciation and respect for each other (Potrac et al. 2002), is both dynamic and complex (Jones and Wallace 2005), and requires discovering and fulfilling needs of both the coach and athlete (Jowett and Cockerill 2003). Numerous authors suggest that an effective coach-athlete relationship is necessary for a successful coaching outcome (Lafrenière et al. 2011; Shields et al. 1997). Factors that contribute to the coach-athlete relationship include, but are not limited to: planning and designing the coaching engagement, building and maintaining rapport, establishing and maintaining trust, building credibility (Mageau and Vallerand 2003, Rezania and Lingham 2009a)\n\nLeader-member exchange (LMX) theory is often used to study a leader’s individual relationship interaction with their followers. LMX is a process theory of leadership that combines exchange and role theory (Graen and Uhl-Bien 1995), and is often used to account for development of high quality relationships between the leader and the subordinates (Bass 1990). The theory emphasizes that when leaders offer the opportunity for high-quality relationships, the performance of in-group members would increase (Graen et al. 1982). Developing a high quality relationship is a process that starts with the leader offering a membership in the in-group, followed by a period of “acquaintance” phase. Finally the “partner” phase is reached based on exchanges and development of trust and mutual respect (Graen and Uhl-Bien 1995). An outcome of high quality relationship is commitment (Meyer and Allen 1991).\n\nIn formulation of a theoretical model for the study of coach-athlete relationship, commitment provides a useful prototype. Meyer and Allen (1991) conceptualize commitment as a construct with three related dimensions. The affective dimension reflects the emotional aspect and encapsulates identification and involvement in the relationship; the continuance dimension relates to the perceived cost to leave the relationship, and finally; the normative dimension relates to the feeling of obligation to the relationship based on the congruence in values and norms.\n\nRecent research into commitment has focused on investigating different targets of commitment within the organization. Commitment has been conceptualized to study a person’s relationship to another person in a social exchange (Cook and Emerson 1978), a person’s relationship to a group (Ellemers et al. 1997, Cropanzano and Mitchell 2005), a person’s relationship to an organization (Allen and Meyer 1990, Tzafrir and Enosh 2011), or person’s relationship to his/her supervisor (Stinglhamber and Vandenberghe 2003). Commitment to the supervisor has been studied as a factor that motivates citizenship behaviours (Redman and Snape 2005) or reduce employee turnover (Maertz et al. 2007).\n\nRecently, the construct has been used to explain behavioural outcomes in educational contexts (McNally and Irving 2010). Considering the extant commitment literature in traditional workplace contexts, the educational institutions context, and the supervisory relationship context, it is reasonable to use the construct of commitment to the coach to evaluate coach-athlete relationship.\n\nIn line with the extant commitment literature, we conceptualize commitment to the coach as a strong belief in the goals and values (normative); a willingness to exert considerable effort on behalf of the coach (affective); and a strong desire to continue working (continuance) with the coach (Mowday et al. 1979; Sturges et al. 2005). In this manner, commitment refers to a sense of duty that a student-athlete feels to achieve the coach’s goals and to the willingness to do what is needed to perform well (Kline and Peters 1991). Such cohesion and identification with the coach emerges, for instance, when the coach properly demonstrates leadership in leading the team to success (Carron et al. 2002).\n\nPredictors of commitment to the coach\n\nTraining (T&D) student-athletes to attain high levels of performance is one of the most important responsibilities of a coach (Oliver et al. 2010). Training has the potential to draw a desired set of athlete’s attitudes and behaviours, and provides student-athletes the context to learn knowledge and skills for a specific purpose (Stein 2001). Training is an intentional activity to transfer the expertise, information, and also modify the attitude and behaviours aligned with the organizational goals (Brown and McCracken 2010).\n\nIn the organizational work settings, training is expected to influence job safety, self-importance, job satisfaction, and organizational commitment (Bartlett 2001). Training could be formal or informal. Formal training has a structured mode of delivery, is planned, and has a pre-set objective. Informal training, on the other hand, is less structured and is delivered on an ad-hoc basis. Whether formal or informal, training has a positive connection with organizational commitment (Owoyemi et al. 2011).\n\nThe effect of training on student-athlete’s role-behaviour and performance could be mediated by commitment. Student-athlete’s perception of the training she/he receives may contribute to the commitment to the coach. In addition, training may empower the student-athlete to work independently, participate in decision-making with other team members and work in the team. A coach who emphasizes training, may also emphasize enabling the student-athlete to take decisions in a decentralized manner and share with the team. Bishop et al. (2005) assert that the “level of support employees receive from an entity predicts the level of commitment they have for that same entity” (p. 175).\n\nWe therefore expect such training to be associated with commitment.\n\nH2.a T&D is positively associated with commitment.\n\nH2.b Commitment to the coach mediates the effect of T&D on student-athlete in-role behaviour.\n\nInformation sharing is another responsibility of the coach (Lyle 2002). Leadership literature indicates that follower performance, satisfaction, and retention are all influenced by relation with his/her immediate supervisor (Goleman et al. 2002). Student-athletes look to their coach for cues and information regarding what to do and how to do it. Coaching skills are firmly grounded in communication abilities including listening, feedback, and information sharing (Goleman et al. 2002). Communication is necessary for establishing and sustaining trust, and establishment of psychological contracts (Rousseau and Greller 1994). Information sharing reflects the extent to which coaches participate in the mentoring/coaching role to foster each student-athlete’s learning and development. At the heart of this facilitative coaching is an approachable communication style that fosters learning and development through clarifying expectations, providing relevant and up-to-date information, and enabling the student-athlete to obtain the relevant information (Sullivan and Gee 2007).\n\nThe effect of information sharing on student-athletes’ role-behaviour could be mediated by commitment to the coach. Student-athletes’ perception of the way the coach shares the necessary information may contribute to the commitment to the coach. In addition, information sharing should empower the student-athlete to participate in decentralized participative decision-making and work in the team (Kellett 1999). A coach, who emphasizes information sharing, may also emphasize enabling the student-athlete to participate in decision-making. We therefore expect information sharing to be associated with the commitment to the coach, and role behaviour.\n\nH3.a Information sharing is positively associated with commitment to the coach.\n\nH3.b Commitment to the coach mediates the effect of information on student-athlete in-role behaviour.\n\nLeadership behaviours that lead to sharing power or giving more responsibility and autonomy to the followers have been the subject of many studies (Kirkman and Rosen 1999). Empowerment is considered an important mechanism for motivating and encouraging performance (Seibert et al. 2004). The effect of leadership behaviours on organizational commitment is indirectly affected by empowerment (Avolio et al. 2004). In this paper we consider promoting teamwork as coaches’ empowering behaviours that encourage student-athletes to participate in decentralized and participative decision-making and work as a team (Zimmerman 1990). This behaviour provides the student-athlete the skills and freedom to decide. We expect commitment to the coach to mediate the effect of promoting-teamwork on student athletes’ role behaviour\n\nH4.a Promoting teamwork is positively associated with commitment.\n\nH4.b Commitment to the coach mediates the effect of promoting teamwork on student-athlete in-role behaviour.\n\nDiscussion and practical implications\n\nWe have examined how coaching behaviours of training and development, information sharing, and encouraging teamwork are related to one another; to commitment to the coach; and to student-athletes’ in-role behaviour. Several possible causal relationships were tested. In this manner, the prior research on the impact of coach-athlete relationship is extended by looking at how commitment to the coach mediates the effect of coaching behaviours on student-athlete role behaviour and performance.\n\nA contribution of this study is to consider the case of intercollegiate sport at the universities and colleges, and conceptualize commitment to the coach in the same manner this concept is conceptualized in the human resources literature. This conceptualization enables us to explore the inter-relationship between coaching behaviours and their outcomes in terms of relationship with the coach. Most of the prior research has conceptualized commitment to the team or commitment to the sport (Casper et al. 2007).\n\nFirst, we asked if commitment to the coach impacts role-behaviour. This study confirms the impact of athlete-coach relationships, measured against the construct of commitment, on student-athlete role behaviour. This is in line with the extant commitment literature in traditional workplace contexts and educational institutions that highlight the importance of commitment on behavioural outcomes.\n\nSecond, we asked if coaching behaviours such as training and development, information sharing, and encouraging teamwork impact commitment to the coach. The impact of information sharing on commitment is confirmed with a medium effect size. The impact of encouraging teamwork and training and development is confirmed, but the effect size is small. Thus, among the individuals in this study, it appears that student-athletes’ perceptions of the extent to which their coach trains them, and shares information and encourages them to work as a team is associated with the extent to which they feel committed to the coach. However, information sharing plays a much stronger role than training and development or encouraging teamwork. This indicates that coaches should pay significant attention to information sharing.\n\nThird, we asked if commitment to the coach mediates the effect of coaching behaviours including training and development, information sharing, and encouraging teamwork on student-athletes’ role-behaviour. The results indicate that commitment to the coach mediates the effect of information sharing on role-bahaviour. When commitment to the coach is present, the direct effect of information sharing on role-behaviour is not significantly different than zero. The same is true for the relationship between encouraging teamwork and role-behaviour. Commitment to the coach is therefore a significant factor in explaining the importance of the coach-athlete relationship for athlete performance.\n\nOur study contributes to the current literature in two ways. First, it contributes to the literature on coach-athlete relationship by applying the concept of commitment to the coach. This helps diversify research approaches to understanding coach-athlete relationships. This responds to the call by Poczwardowski et al. (2006) to extend the current research on coach-athlete relationships by considering how social exchange shapes the relationship between the coach and athlete.\n\nSecond, this study extends prior research on commitment by looking at the context of student-athletes and their relationship with their coach. Most of the prior research has focused on the commitment between an organization and its employees. As noted in the introduction of this study, the HRM literature reports a strong relationship between commitment and behavioural outcomes. The findings reinforce previous work in the HRM field and extend existing theories to the context of coaching athletic teams. Consistent with the premises of social exchange theory, it appears that team members (student-athletes) who feel committed to the coach are more likely to be willing to do more than is required and perform well.\n\nGiven that very little was found in the literature about the role of commitment to the coach in the context of coaching student-athletes, the presented results are encouraging and have important implications for developing coaching practices that lead to commitment to the coach. The results of this study indicate the importance of three coaching practices that lead to commitment, and the willingness to do more. It also indicates that among these three practices, information sharing plays a more important role than training and development or encouraging teamwork.\n\nAs Jowett and Cockerill (2003), suggest, the coach-athlete relationship is intentionally developed through appreciation and respect for each other, is both dynamic and complex, and requires discovering and fulfilling needs of both the coach and the athlete. Our study indicates that adopting practices that focus on training and development, sharing of information, and encouraging teamwork can contribute to the development of high quality relationships between the coach and the athlete, which in turn results in the athlete’s willingness to do more. Universities should therefor adopt policies and procedures that enable effective coaching practices. Such practices have been advocated by the HRM literature. Furthermore, HRM is able to provide guidelines about those organizational design elements such as recruitment, training, and job design that directly affect the performance of coaches. In this respect HRM is one of the crucial elements in managing the expectations of student-athletes.\n\nThe study highlights the ability of coaches to develop committed athletes. Athletic directors and sport manages should train and enable coaches to enhance their interaction with the athletes in order to provide them with opportunities to share information. The student-athlete should generally feel well informed by the coach about changes that affect them or about important issues concerning their role as a student-athlete. They should also have a complete understanding of what is expected of them in the student-athlete position and receive adequate and honest feedback. Student-athletes should be effectively facilitated to the information and resources needed to perform to their best abilities as a student-athlete. The universities should provide the required infrastructure and enable the coaches to reach these objectives.\n\nAs a teacher, a coach should be able to focus on providing student athletes with training on key skills and abilities. The training should be relevant and meet the needs of their role as a student-athlete and help them to perform well in that position. The coach should enable and empower the student-athlete to make decisions about sport specific issues. This will enable the student-athlete to perform effectively in the team.\n\nThe managerial significance of this research rests in the insight provided into how coaching practices influence athlete’s behaviour through commitment to the coach. Managers can influence those practices by institutionalizing best practices."
