        "text": "It’s the start of a new school year! There is certainly excitement and apprehension in the air, from college freshmen (our granddaughter Margo) to high school freshmen (our grandson Jess) to kindergarten students!\n\nWhat a great challenge for coaches and teachers at all levels. We are all filled with different emotions, ranging from high expectations to doubts that limit what we can really accomplish.\n\nYour mind is an amazing instrument. Use it to have wonderful thoughts, purposeful goals and positive direction.\n\nYour mind can also create negatives that put limitations on the things we want to do. Thoughts like I’m not good enough or Nobody likes me: the players, the parents, the administration, the boosters. These thoughts can challenge you every day and keep you from moving forward.\n\nThe truth is that change, like a new school year, will push you out of your comfort zone. Add that to a mind shooting out negative thoughts and it can be a real challenge to stay positive.\n\nI too have to fight the mind’s habit of giving negative thoughts. These days it likes to tell me, “You are too old to be working with Nike and running a basketball coaching consulting business. It’s time to relax and enjoy life.”\n\nIt’s easy to believe that. I’ve just turned 25 for the third time and I find that it can be hard to accept the challenge of doing new or different things. When I was writing my books my mind told me, “You can’t do that. You are not good enough or smart enough.”\n\nYour mind loves the comfort zone\n\nYou must be able to combat the mind’s habit of trying to keep you in your comfort zone.\n\nAs the new sports seasons commence some teams, based on past successes, will have a mindset of, “We will be good again; we will just reload.” For example, Ohio State’s football program lost 16 starters and is still picked in the top 10 in the country!\n\nGreat traditions, great program, great coaches all lead to a mindset, particularly by fans, to assume they’ll always be good!\n\nYet there will always be those who let doubt enter their mind: “The defensive backfield will not be as good” or “the O line has been replaced” or “we lack experience and have not been battle-tested.” Perhaps the doubt in Buckeye-land is reduced after their opening win of 70-10 over Bowling Green!\n\nThe mind can make a heaven of hell or a hell of heaven!\n\nYou must accept the challenge that your mind can cause good and bad thoughts. So you must follow your heart, seek the truth and focus on the things that are best for you. Most of all, things like your players and team, your family, your school and your friends. This is the best way to develop habits that are positive and allow you to become the best you can become!\n\nAs the school year starts, you will be severely challenged. There will be setbacks, defeat, unprepared players and frustrating colleagues, but you can control your mind with a heart that loves and seeks the truth.\n\nChallenge the day today to be the best you’ll ever be. Repeat tomorrow. And tomorrow.\n\nI am excited for you and even more excited for me!! Let’s help each other hold a good thought.\n\nCOMFORT ON!\n\nor\n\nCOMFORT OVER!\n\nor\n\nCOMFORT OUT!\n\nYou make the choice!\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nJim Burson is a sought-after basketball coaching consultant and motivational speaker. He is known as a “coach’s coach” (Sports Illustrated) for his lifetime commitment to improving the quality of the game at all levels and his passion for working with coaches to help them become the best they can be."
