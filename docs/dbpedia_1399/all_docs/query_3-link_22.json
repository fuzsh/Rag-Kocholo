        "text": "Have you heard of #veteran #transitionstress? It's a common among separating #veterans when they leave the military since for many that is all they know. The hurdles they face are numerous: finding a new job, losing their military friends, finding purpose, and losing routine, to name a few. It is a challenging time, as many may not want to ask for help as they try to adapt to civilian life. Some #veterans have compared the experience to shedding their military \"skin,\" much like Will Ferrell's character in Zoolander. As a US Navy #veteran myself, I experienced many of these hurdles, but was fortunate to find opportunities at veteran-friendly companies like Toll Brothers and Mercalis. If you know a veteran who's experiencing a recent transition, please show your support by connecting with them, giving them advice, or just asking how they're doing so they know they are not alone. And if you don't know a veteran, consider supporting some great charities that help veterans, like Mission 22, Irreverent Warriors, Inc., or The SUP Veterans. Please help make this transition a little easier for those who have served our country. #supportveterans #veterancharities https://lnkd.in/db-ARbHM\n\nWhen a photo says 1,000 words. This photo was shared by my sweet friend, Jenny Lynne Stroup & it hasn‚Äôt left my mind since seeing her original post. Pictured is the USS DWIGHT D EISENHOWER CVN 69 with its lights off & at rest after returning home recently from a very long, extended deployment‚Ä¶ ‚Ä¶& then extended again. Directly next to it is the USS Harry S. Truman with its lights on & ready to roll out. Here‚Äôs the thing - Deployment‚Äôs don‚Äôt stop. This is an example of only 2 US Navy aircraft carriers swapping out on mission. At this moment, the U.S. has over 200,000 military personnel deployed. 200,000 service members away from their family, friends, & loved ones. 200,000 service members families ‚Äúholding down the fort‚Äù & just waiting for the day their service member comes home. When one unit comes home, another unit heads out. Rinse & repeat. *Deployments don‚Äôt stop.* Support for our service members can‚Äôt stop. Resources MUST be constantly fueled & on the ready. Nonprofits & organizations supporting the service members that keep us sleeping peacefully at night are constantly needed. If you ever needed a sign or red flag stating WHY military support organizations are NEEDED‚Ä¶this is it. üö© Because deployments don‚Äôt stop. **I encourage you to pop over to Cassidy Norman‚Äôs posts & read a bit more into what the Ike‚Äôs deployment looked like for its crew. Hint - ‚Äú‚Ä¶the most intense & sustained combat at sea since World War II.‚Äù Believe me, you‚Äôll want to read the rest. #operationgratitude #supportourtroops #nonprofit #socialimpact #giveback #volunteer #remembereveryonedeployed Operation Gratitude\n\nServing Today The world certainly is full of strife, uncertainty, death, destruction and so much more. However, as a mother of a daughter who is engaged to a pilot in the military it takes on a new dimension of hypervigilance watching the news. What do you do? We start each day knowing that we love our country and honor the men and women who are serving in the military. Serving means so much more these days with costs for these soldiers, sailors, airmen, spacemen, marines hitting them hard with increased housing and food prices as the tip of the iceberg. The stress of constant hurry up and wait as orders change due to the changing world. The stress on their families and their children being away from their loved ones. Yet mission is what this is all about to those serving in the military. The mission to protect this great country. To provide the freedom of speech, the ability to gather, the right to criticize is what drives these men and women to do what they do. So, please stop on Veterans Day and find a way to thank those that have served and those that are serving now. Call a family member that may have served in the past and say they are appreciated. Donate to a veteran‚Äôs cause ‚Äì there are many. Tell that company that has military discounts you appreciate them for helping the current military families‚Äô that serve make it. Honor. Dignity. Commitment. Courage. Sacrifice. Just a few attributes that describe active, deceased, and retired military personnel‚Äôs service.\n\nüéñÔ∏è Introducing the \"Military Branch Showdown\" ‚Äì your chance to proudly represent your favorite branch: Army, Air Force, Navy, Marine Corps, or Coast Guard!

We are huge, and proud, supporters of the United Kingdoms Armed Forces, and the Armed Forces of our friends, and allies. Based on the unique Royal Navy Mine Clearance Diver branch, our ethos is no fuss, no excuses, just get it done. We go back to basics. No waffle. A solid, no nonsense mindset. I am sick of hearing about blame, and risk aversion. We have gone soft as a society. Confidence, pride, mental and physical health, and growth, are all formed by challenging yourself, and accepting responsibility. So adopt that mindset. Get your company, military unit, friends, colleagues, sports club, or charity, and step forward in 2024. We are growing, and we will succeed in our mission. Get in touch. #noblame #change #newmindset #acceptresponsibility\n\nThere‚Äôs a category of #military brats that are especially deserving of the nation‚Äôs recognition, gratitude, and serious study: the roughly 2 million Post-9/11 military children who experienced at least one if not multiple parental deployments‚Äîmost often to theaters of #war‚Äîin the 20yr period after 2001. Already by 2011 (the formal end of the Iraq War), more than 4,300 of these children had had a parent killed in the Iraq & Afghanistan wars. As of 2015, that number had reached some 5,000. It‚Äôs difficult to know exactly how many American military kids are survivors or orphans of troops who were killed in the line of duty during the #GWOT, or who they are, let alone the total numbers of children survivors of all those who‚Äôve served in the Post-9/11 era: There does not appear to be any type of database or central repository of information from which to find them. Surveying the past 35 years with the Lucas Group, however, the nonprofit Fallen Patriots has estimated that approximately 25,000 children have lost an active duty parent during that time (whether from accident, illness, hostilities, or suicide). The majority of these fatalities were their fathers. We owe a debt to these military children that goes far beyond media pronouncements and themed events once a year in April.\n\nA Call To Action: Demand Your Senators Support the VETT Act (S.677) Our legislative team needs your help to pass critical veterans legislation. We won‚Äôt be successful without voices like yours reaching out to your Members of Congress. The VSO Equal Tax Treatment (VETT) Act, a bill allowing all veteran non-profits like AMVETS and the American Legion to receive tax-deductible charitable gifts, is stuck in the Senate (S.677). This bill is crucial because Congressionally Chartered Veteran non-profits cannot have more than 10 percent of non-wartime-era veterans in their membership. If they do, the IRS will no longer let AMVETS & American Legion Posts receive tax-deductible charitable gifts, like every other charitable organization in America. And we think that‚Äôs a bunch of baloney. Veteran non-profits shouldn‚Äôt be penalized for welcoming home honorably discharged Cold War Era veterans. Our Cold War Era Veterans are invaluable members of our Nation and the AMVETS family. The law is unfair to them and their service. This outdated rule must be changed. Your Senators are the key to passing the VETT Act, and your voice is needed to see this bill enacted.

Today marks the 80th anniversary of the D-Day landings; and I'd like us to pause and reflect on the courage, resilience, and unwavering commitment of the brave men and women who stormed the beaches of Normandy on that fateful day in 1944. Allied Forces Unite: Troops from the UK, the USA, Canada, and France joined forces to launch the largest seaborne invasion in history. Their collective determination turned the tide of World War II, laying the foundation for an Allied victory. From Portsmouth to Normandy: On June 6, 1944, these heroes faced unimaginable challenges as they waded through the cold waters, dodging bullets and artillery fire. Their sacrifice and resilience paved the way for freedom and peace. Remembering Our Veterans: Today, we stand on the shoulders of giants‚Äîthose who risked everything for our liberty. Let us remember their valour, their sacrifice, and their unwavering commitment to a better world. Supporting Our Veterans: Supporting veterans isn‚Äôt just about remembering the past; it‚Äôs about ensuring their well-being today. You can support this by advocating for mental health services, employment opportunities, and a strong support network for those who served. Learning from History: The lessons of D-Day resonate across generations. We must teach our children about the importance of unity, peace, and freedom. Their testimony serves as a timeless reminder that we must never take these precious values for granted. https://lnkd.in/eSuBiMy6 #DDay80 #RememberingHeroes Tim O'Keefe (FIRP) Nick Garland CDW UK Mark Murphy"
