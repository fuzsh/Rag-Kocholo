        "text": "BASIC PRINCIPLES\n\nCROATIAN PARTY OF RIGHTS 1861\n\nThe Croatian People is the independent national unity; It is a Nation by itself. In its national meaning it is neither identical to any other nation, nor is it a part of any other nation.\n\nThe Croatian people is indigenous people, and beside its ethnic origin, in its modern sense of the word, it is composed of all Croatian citizens, regardless to their ethnic origin, and by their conscience and by their commitment they form Croatian nation.\n\nThe Croatian people by themselves and as the political nation have right to the full sovereignty and the self government.\n\nINTRODUCTORY PRINCIPLES\n\nArticle 1\n\nCroatian people is one of the oldest European nations, the people who struggled through various historical times and conditions, fighting permanently for its independence and sovereign state.\n\nSettled to the today' s territory, the Croatian people formed their own state community in which they lived independently up to the year 1102. Loosing the independence and sovereignty, the Croatian people lived for eight centuries under strange government, keeping however their national distinctiveness and the idea of the right on their own state.\n\nThe pivot of the national conscience of the Croatian people and the idea of the right on their own state from 1861 is the Croatian Party of Rights and its founder dr. Ante Starèeviæ. The Croatian Party of Rights is the oldest party of the Croatian people. It was banned in 1929.\n\nThe Croatian Party of Rights - 1861 is the political organisation which continues this political way on the basic principles established by Dr. Ante Starèeviæ, in order to establish completely independent Croatian State on its entire ethnical and historical territory.\n\nArticle 2\n\nThe Croatian Party of Rights - 1861 is explicitly against establishment or creation of any kind of new Yugoslavia or Great Serbia and in this sense it will always support the defensive alliance of the victims of the Serbian aggression.\n\nArticle 3\n\nThe Croatian Party of Rights - 1861 is supporting the establishment of the independent and happy Croatia, which will be built on the modern democratic foundations in the spirit of freedom, in which the main principles will be the reign of rights and the protection of human rights.\n\nIn order to achieve this noble objective, the Croatian Party of Rights - 1861 is starting from the principles of the Croatian right to have its own state, it supports the political attitudes struggling for the full independence of the Croatian State Community, it relies on the glorious Croatian experience and is taking care of the modern needs of the Croatian people.\n\nArticle 4\n\nThe Croatian Party of Rights - 1861 will struggle for introduction of the principles of the constitutional state and civilised society, and for the entire protection of human rights of all its citizens, regardless to their religion or ethnic origin, on basis of their Croatian belonging.\n\nIn realisation of this important objective, the Croatian Party of Rights - 1861 will follow the provisions of the early English, American and French declarations in the spirit of freedom, and especially on basis which have been comprised in the General Declaration of Human Rights, as the part of the United Nations Charter, International Treaty on Civil and Political Rights, International Treaty on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights and other important international documents.\n\nArticle 5\n\nThe systematic oppression of Croatian people and its difficult material situation, caused mass emigration of Croats, both from the Republic of Croatia and from its historical parts like Baèka, Banat, Boka Kotorska, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Sandak and Srijem.\n\nThe consequences of such movements result in a terrifying fact that one half of Croats live abroad having no influence on the destiny of their parent country.\n\nTherefore the Croatian Party of Rights - 1861 will endeavour to make possible for all Croats to retum to their ancestral hearths and to be able to contribute, as much as possible, to the reconstruction and flourish of our beautiful country.\n\nArticle 6\n\nThe Croatian Party of Rights - 1861 will eagerly work on total removal of consequences of the ideological and political dictatorship of the Yugoslav and Bolshevist Socialism.\n\nThe Croatian Party of Rights - 1891 will in its acting, permanently request that the constitutional state and its normal operation prevent the creation of political organisations based on the violent and inhuman principles.\n\nArticle 7\n\nThe Croatian Party of Rights - 1861 will support the keeping and development of the national consciousness, the Croatian language and civilisation.\n\nThe Croatian Party of Rights - 1861 will permanently struggle for the welfare and the ethic transformation of the Croatian people, for restoration and consolidation of its general human values, as well as for application of morality in the complete social life.\n\nArticle 8\n\nThe Croatian Party of Rights - 1861 will support the protection of the rights of the minvrity groups and those groups of the Croatian citizens who, beside their belonging to the Croatian nation, feel their belonging to a certain ethnic group or minority group, and all in accordance with European standards in protection of the rights of minority groups.\n\nPOLITICALLY CONSTRUCTIVE PRINCIPLES\n\nArticle 9\n\nThe Croatian people is the bearer of the unlimited, inalienable, indivisible, unassignable and unexpendable sovereignty.\n\nArticle 10\n\nOn basis of the established existence of the uninterrupted sequence of the Croatian statehood and clear aspirations of the Croatian people for state self- determination, the Croatian Party of Rights - 1861 primary interceded for complete establishment of the state power within the internationallv recognised borders of the Republic of Croatia.\n\nRespecting the international recognition of the Republic of Croatia and the Republic of Bvsnia and Herzegovina, the Croatian Party of Rights - 1861 will support as close as possible co-ordination and creation of confederate or federal state communities between Republic of Croatia and the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina, with respect of subjectivity of both countries.\n\nUnder the new circumstances when the Croatian historical and ethnic space has been divided into two sovereign countries, the Croatian Party of Rights - 1861 will support their federal or confederate unification by peoples' free will, with motto: \"Croatia up to river Drina, BiH up to Adriatic Sea.\"\n\nArticle 11\n\nThe Croatian Party of Rights - 1861 opposes to every state or any other confederate association, which objective would be restoration of Yugoslavia or any other similar or forced association.\n\nWe consider the every acknowledgement of the constitutional right to any other ethnic group in the Republic of Croatia is contrary to the interests and aspirations of the Croatian people, and therefore the Croatian Party of Rights - 1861 does not accept the federalisation of Croatia and similar ideas.\n\nThe Croatian Party of Rights - 1861 struggles for creation of a unique Croatian state which would be divided into counties and those in districts and municipalities. The Croatian state would control army, the borders, one part of the internal affairs, currency and other affairs of state, while the counties would control police, education, one part of financial affairs. The districts and municipalities would have authorisations which would overpass those of the present counties. In the decentralised state administration, in the application and the respect of the local legislation, the Croatian Party of Rights - 1861 sees a guarantee of the complete and unique Croatia and a dam against tendencies which reject the idea of the integral and undivided Croatia.\n\nArticle 12\n\nThe Croatian Party of Rights - 1861 will oppose to any treaty or agreement which is contrary to the basic right of the Croatian people, the right on existence of an independent and autonomic state.\n\nArticle 13\n\nIn Croatian state in accordance with its Constitution there has to be done strict division among legislative power, judiciary and executive power.\n\nThe Croatian Party of Rights - 1861 will struggle for development of the parliamentary democracy and the civil state in which all its citizens have equal rights. The Croatian party of rights will fight against dogmatism, neocommunism, neofascism and inflexible centralism.\n\nArticle 14\n\nThe legislative bodies are to be elected on secret and direct elections carried out on basis of the equal and general voting rights.\n\nA11 bodies of the Croatian constitutional state have to act against Constitution, law and other legal prescriptions, independently of interests of any political organisation. For Croatian Party of Rights - 1861, the Croatian Parliament (Sabor), has to become the legislative and political decision making centre.\n\nArticle 15\n\nThe Croatian Party of Rights - 1861 supports the revocation of the semipresidential Constitution and limitation of the presidential power to the function of the representative of the state and symbol of the unity of the nation and the state sovereignty.\n\nThe army, police, education and similar organised state activities cannot be used for interests of only one political party. The Croatian Party of Rights - 1861 will specifically support the military build-up of the Croatian state by development of the military industry instead of supporting the var profiteers through black market of all kinds of weapons. In this sense the Croatian Party of Rights - 1861 will struggle for complete reorganisation of the Ministry of Defence and its organisation in accordance with the Israeli or Swiss model.\n\nArticle 16\n\nThe Croatian Party of Rights - 1861 will support the independentjudiciary, and fight against interference of the executive power in the work of tribunals.\n\nThe judges are by unique and equal procedures elected for an undetermined period of time, and they can be revoked only in cases and against procedure foreseen by the law.\n\nHUMAN RIGHTS\n\nArticle 17\n\nThe basic principle for protection of human rights comprises the true universal human rights in the direction and in the frame of its existence. The situation of the human is the criterion of the values of the social system, and the human rights are to be in the foundations of the system itself.\n\nArticle 18\n\nThe Croatian Party of Rights - 1861 will pay special attention to the protection of rights especially of the violated or threatened human beings, and will support he mobilisation of the scientific, educational and information methods aimed at the universal respect of human rights.\n\nThe Croatian Party of Rights - 1861 will especially support the freedom of media, culture, art, science and publicity, and the undisturbed development of the political parties and trade unions.\n\nThe Croatian Party of Rights - 1861 is explicitly against political systems of Bolshevik and fascist type as well as against any type of ideology which is opposed to the inherited democratic systems.\n\nArticle 19\n\nThe Croatian citizen is any person of the Croatian ethnic origin, as well as any other person who is the holder of the Croatian citizenship regardless to his/her ethnic origin.\n\nAll Croatian citizens are equal regardless to their race, colour, sex, nationality, language, religion, education, possessions, their legal or social standing. The ethnic origin cannot be reason for special protection from responsibility.\n\nAll persons are equal in front of the law and they have right to the equal protection.\n\nEvery person has right to his/her free opinion and conscience, and the right to hold peaceful public meetings and to organise meetings with purpose.\n\nNo person should be subject to arbitrary interference into his/her private life or family, private home or personal correspondence.\n\nArticle 20\n\nAll religions are equal.\n\nThe Church is separated from the sate, and the religion is the personal matter of every human being.\n\nThe Croatian Party of Rights - 1861 respects all religious traditions and supports all Croatian patriotic activities of all religious communities.\n\nThe Croatian Party of Rights - 1861 will endeavour that the Croatian citizens of the Orthodox Church have the right to establish their autocephalous church and name it by their name, so that such church be accepted by the Croatian state with equal rights as all other religious communities.\n\nThe Croatian Party of Rights - 1861 opposes for one religion, regardless to the number of its believers, to be protected by the Croatian state or to be declared state religion.\n\nArticle 21\n\nThe Croatian Party of Rights - 1861 is against all political lawsuits, against physical and mental torture during pre-trial investigations, as well as against misuse of psychiatry for achievement of illegal objectives.\n\nThe Croatian Party of Rights - 1861 will support carrying out all procedures and actions aimed toward noble endeavour for protection of the seriously violated or threatened human rights.\n\nArticle 22\n\nThe rights and freedoms of every person can be limited by law only and this in accordance with the Constitution and international conventions for the protection of human rights.\n\nGENERAL AIMS\n\nArticle 23\n\nThe Croatian Party of Rights - 1861 is promoting the dignity and the reputation of woman, and endeavours for her equal participation in the social, economic and political life of the country.\n\nThe Croatian Party of Rights - 1861 will protect the motherhood, the family and the raise of the new generations.\n\nThe Croatian Party of Rights - 1861 will always support the protection of life from its conception to its natural death, and this especially by creating better living standard of population, especially women, and by protection of motherhood, and not by repressive measures.\n\nThe Croatian people is in demographic threat because of its low birth-rate and its mass emigration, and therefore the Croatian Party of Rights - 1861 will endeavour to this reason too, for protection of all human lives.\n\nThe Croatian Party of Rights - 1861 will struggle for Croatian state to be obliged to educate and look after abandoned children and children in need.\n\nArticle 24\n\nThe Croatian Party of Rights - 1861 supports the realisation of right on general medical care.\n\nThe Croatian Party of Rights - 1861 requests that every Croatian citizen, who is incapable for work be allowed to receive monthly allowance (pension) regardless to his/her years of work.\n\nThe Croatian Party of Rights - 1861 requests for all victims of repression to be provided with material and moral assistance.\n\nArticle 25\n\nThe Croatian Pariy of Rights - 1861 opposes to alienation and seizure of socially-owned property by declaring it state property or by selling it to the other persons.\n\nThe Croatian Party of Rights - 1861 supports the fair transformation, i.e. privatisation of the national property, without plunder, robbery or fraud in style of the Latin-American pillage.\n\nThe Croatian Party of Rights is for immediate denationatisation of the seized property of the citizens and institutions and for freezing, revision and legal sanctioning of illegal transformation.
