        "text": "Weekly Briefing, Vol. 67. No. 1 (BH) November 2023\n\nSecurity issues in Bosnia and Herzegovina: Ethnic tensions and the migrant crisis\n\nSummary\n\nWhen it comes to security issues in Bosnia and Herzegovina, questions about possible new conflicts are repeatedly raised in the media and among political decision makers. These conflicts are linked to possible demands for the internal reorganization of BiH, which are more or less openly advocated by parts of different political elites in BiH. These demands go in different directions, from the desire and demand for the centralization of the state through the weakening or abolition of the middle level of government – cantons or entities, through the demand for the strengthening of those middle levels of government and the weakening of the state level, to radical demands for (sic!) peaceful disunification and independence. In addition to these, internally generated security challenges, there are also external ones. The most importan is the migrant crisis, which also occurs at intervals. Occasional ones, related to terrorism and the departure of BiH citizens to battlefields and crisis areas, can be subsumed under challenges that are a combination internal and external factors. Finally, although minor, we can also mention possible security challenges due to social unrest due to the difficult economic situation in which a large number of BiH citizens find themselves, although the last major protests were in 2014.\n\nIntroduction\n\n“Security challenges in the Federation of BiH” is the name of the thematic session of the Security Committee of the House of Representatives (HoR) of the Parliament of the Federation of BiH (FBiH), which was held at the end of October. At this session, which was held with the cooperation and support of the International Republican Institute (IRI) in BiH, it was discussed, as the name itself suggests, about the most significant security challenges in this BiH entity. And what are the challenges in one entity, they are definitely in the other, that is, in the whole of BiH. Borislav Spasojević, director of the IRI office for BiH, reminded that this Institute has been working on challenges in BiH. He mentioned that the war in Ukraine as well as the “current crisis between Israel and Palestine” have indications of what is happening “both in BiH and throughout Europe.” He also mentioned the migrant crisis as one of the challenges that requires cross-border cooperation of all countries in the region and very good coordination with the European Union[1].\n\nTaking into account not only this session of the Commission but also the broader security picture in BiH, we can single out several security challenges in BiH. Some are more present in the media in the sense that they are written and talked about more than other topics, which appear from time to time. Some challenges are more related to internal movements in BiH society itself, some others are the product of external factors, and still others are a mixture of internal and external. When we take everything into account, in order of intensity, the security challenges faced by BiH are: 1) challenges arising from potential inter-ethnic conflicts in BiH, 2) migrant crisis, 3) global terrorism, and 4) social unrest.\n\nInter-ethnic tensions\n\nFor several months in BiH, at various points of the line that separates the two entities in BiH, rallies have been held in support of the president of the entity Republic Srpska (RS), Milorad Dodik, and the policies he represents. The protests are organized by senior leaders of Dodik’s party, the Alliance of Independent Social Democrats (Savez nezavisnih socijaldemokrata – SNSD), who also appear at these rallies. Tthese protests are limited to short-term stopping of traffic more than anything else, while sending the message that – the border exists.\n\nThe protests are a response to the beginning of the trial to Dodik, whom the Prosecutor’s Office of BiH accuses of violating the Criminal Code of BiH by initiating the adoption of a law in the RS on the unenforceability of the decisions of the Constitutional Court of BiH as well as the decision of the High Representative of the international community for BiH (OHR), Christian Schmidt. Dodik does not recognize the Court of Bosnia and Herzegovina (because foreign judges – non-citizens of BiH – sit in it, as well as in the Constitutional Court of BiH), but he appeared at the hearing. After this, the gatherings of his supporters began at the entity border, outside Sarajevo, but also to few other spots. At these gatherings, in addition to supporting Dodik, pro-Russian iconography, photos of Vladimir Putin, and slogans from that register are common[2].\n\nPresident Milorad Dodik, who has close ties to Putin, has openly been striving to separate Bosnian Serb territories from the rest of BiH and join them with neighboring Serbia. Because of that, he was sanctioned by the US in 2017. BiH’s prosecutors started proces againt Dodik for his separatist actions. He could face up to five years in jail if sentenced[3].\n\nSerbian flags can also be seen at these gatherings, and protesters shout slogans against the independence of Bosnia, that is, for the joining of the RS entity with Serbia, which is a demand that Dodik himself proposes from time to time. The Serb protesters chanted slogans against BiH. However, it must be emphasized that so far no incident has been recorded at these gatherings[4].\n\nThis is just the last in a series of numerous endurance tests of post-war peaceful life in BiH. For years, ever since 2006, when Dodik came to power and the international community eased the pressure of the protectorate that it had had since the end of the 1995 war over BiH, there has been a state of permanent crisis, which is the product of different expectations of the elites in the two entities and three political centers in BiH. While Sarajevo and the parties from the capital of BiH want a more centralized state with fewer ethnic blockades where the numerical superiority of the Bosniaks could come to the fore, the parties from RS, more precisely Banja Luka, advocate either a radical solution in the form of the division of BiH or, at the very least, an immediate status and division of competences between the two entities. Croatian parties based in Mostar are not satisfied with the fact that Bosniaks dominate the FBiH and Serbs dominate the RS, and they are demanding more autonomy in the FBiH entity, more precisely – an even more decentralized system in BiH. The different visions of the future of the country reflect the fact that political life in BiH moves from the status quo to the conflict of these concepts that spill over from political rhetoric to everyday life. However, the inter-entity line in BiH is 1,150 kilometers long, which, as one analyst noted, is the length of the front in Ukraine. Can Dodik stop movements in such an area? Obviously not, but the President of Serbia, Aleksandar Vučić, can, just as “the decision on secession, that is, the annexation of the RS rested on Vučić, not on Dodik, just as the decision on the annexation of the eastern parts of Ukraine rested on Putin, not on the local leaders in Donbas”[5].\n\nTo what extent are these political movements that would result in the disintegration of BiH, which would almost inevitably mean conflict, is a question to which there is no unequivocal answer. Some authors tend to be more dramatic in their assessments, others are skeptical. Among the first is Hamza Karčić, an author who recently wrote an article for the Jerusalem Post. Karčić reminds that the Dayton Peace Agreement of 1995, although imperfect, brought peace and stability to the region, but that the ethno-nationalist fault lines have never truly healed. He argues that one of the most egregious threats to Bosnia’s unity lies in the RS, where secessionist ambitions, supported by Serbia and Russia, emboldened by the EU’s appeasement policies over the past years, are rapidly rising.[6]\n\nThis author concludes that it is imperative to acknowledge that Bosnia’s disintegration would reverberate far beyond its borders: The Western world has a vested interest in the maintenance of stability in Southeast Europe as not only does this region serve as a vital corridor for energy supplies and trade routes, but it also represents a litmus test for the international community’s commitment to upholding democratic values, minority rights, and the rule of law[7].\n\nAmong those who believe that Dodik is ready to lead the RS into conflict is Ramiz Salkić, former vice-president of the RS from the Bosniak people and high-ranking official of the Party of Democratic Action (Stranka demokratske akcije – SDA). He claims that the Dodik can very quickly put 100,000 armed men in office who are more or less ready to defend his political goals with arms, without much difficulty. He explained the dramatic warning by claiming that Dodik has seven thousand armed policemen and special heavily armed anti-terrorist unit. Salkić estimated that some 70,000 registered hunters can also be turned into a kind of paramilitary overnight. The media reported Salkic’s status on social networks with the attribution of “Panic in BiH”[8].\n\nEvery year, the United Nations Security Council (UNSC) extends the mandate of the EUFOR Althea mission in BiH. Operation Althea, formally the European Union Force Bosnia and Herzegovina, is a military deployment in BiH to oversee the military implementation of the Dayton Agreement. It is the successor to NATO’s SFOR and IFOR. For several years, there have been demands that this mission be strengthened, or that NATO directly move troops to Bosnia and Herzegovina[9].\n\nIn a recent address to the UNSC, member of the BiH Presidency, Željko Komšić, expressed satisfaction with the extension of the mandate of the EUFOR Althea mission in BiH. He said that BiH is not allowed to have transition to a modern democratic state, so “therefore, it remains stuck in ethnic policies aimed at the complete collapse of the political and social system in the country.” In fact, ethnic politics and ethnic groups are used to create tension and destabilization, in order to achieve short-term and long-term geopolitical goals more easily. I consider such geopolitical behavior towards BiH absolutely unacceptable”[10].\n\nOn the other hand, Neven Anđelić, a Sarajevo native who lives in London and teaches international relations at Regent’s University, believes that conflict in BiH is not possible. He believes that all political actors have learned how to use legal leverage to prevent the development of society and the creation of prosperity for the citizens of BiH.\n\n“It is not a frozen conflict, I would call it a frozen peace in BiH. It is impossible to create conflicts because there is no popular mood for such a thing. The memory of the wars of the 1990’s is fresh and a significant part of society would make a different decision this time. That would be an exodus of the population from BiH, which is already happening for economic reasons, precisely because of this type of government,” says Anđelić, and adds that external actors, primarily Russia, may have an interest in diverting attention from Ukraine with new focal points.\n\n“However, the Western alliance is present in BiH, regardless of whether there is membership in NATO or not. Things are clear here. This is an additional reason that I do not see the possibility of a more organized violent conflict”, Anđelić points out[11].\n\nHaving a mention “Western alliance”, lets also mention that the United States State Department warned in a recent report on the investment situation in BiH that ethnic tensions are high, and that ethno-nationalist parties are struggling to secure or maintain control over certain institutions[12].\n\nMeanwhile, the Federal Police Administration (FUP) said that both they and the Ministry of Internal Affairs (MUP) of the Sarajevo Canton are ready to response in case of unrest on the entity line[13].\n\nMigrant crisis\n\nThe migrant crisis is again at the door of the EU, says the title of one of the recent media articles. In front of the door of the EU or, more precisely: in front of one of the doors of the EU, is BiH. What puts BiH in a worse position is the fact that it still has not introduced visas for citizens of countries that cannot enter the EU countries without a visa, and more specifically, the countries of the Schengen zone. But this is precisely the fact pointed out by the Minister of Foreign Affairs of BiH, Elmedin Konaković: “The migrant crisis is not a problem of BiH, it comes through BiH, it enters and comes to us from the EU”, alluding to the fact that immigrants from the Middle East enter the EU in Bulgaria or Greece, and then on the way to the countries of Western Europe, they leave the EU to Serbia and BiH[14].\n\nThe media have different angles of observation of the migrant crisis too. Thus, in September, we note a text that says that the number of migrants in BiH, and that “citizens are in fear”[15]. The text states that around 4,500 migrants have been prevented from illegally crossing the border since the beginning of the year, and that five times more have entered the country in the same period. In 2021, there were 15,800, and in 2022, there were 27,000. By the end of 2023, the number is expected to reach 30,000. Up to two thousand of them are housed in reception centers. The capacities are therefore not filled. It is announced that BiH should start cooperation with FRONTEX. Then the European Border and Coast Guard Agency would make its contribution at the BiH border. Meanwhile, there is a lot of pain and suffering on the migrant route, and a lot of illegality. Children on the move suffer the most. Most of them are from Afghanistan and Morocco[16].\n\nAnother text publised in October radiates with much more optimism. Officials say: Migrants stay in BiH for a shorter time and move faster to Western Europe. The text states that the International Organization for Migration (IOM) says that the current migrant situation in BiH is stable. Around 2,800 migrants are accommodated in four reception centers in BiH. True, there has been a noticeable steady increase in arrivals since 2021, but the difference, say the IOM, is that migrants are not staying here now. “Migrants are not ‘stuck’ in Bosnia and Herzegovina, nor in general in other countries of the Western Balkans. They tend to transit quite quickly on their way to Western Europe,” the IOM explains[17].\n\nWhen it comes to the countries of origin of the migrants/respondents, most of them are from Afghanistan, as much as 67.9 percent, followed by Morocco with 17 percent, and Pakistan with 4.6 percent. IOM data/findings show that migrants enter BiH through one of four areas on the eastern border with Serbia or through one of three areas located further south, on the border with Montenegro. According to these findings, from the border with Serbia, migrants come by bus or taxi to Sarajevo, where they usually rest for a day or two, and then continue their journey towards the Una-Sana Canton (USK), while some migrants choose to travel from Tuzla to Doboj and Banja Luka, bypassing Sarajevo, in order to try to cross the border near Bosanska Gradiška in the north[18].\n\nTerrorism, domestic and imported\n\nRepresentatives of the police bodies in BiH were surprised by the statement of BiH Security Minister Nenad Nešić when he said that security measures in our country have been raised to a higher level due to fears of a possible spillover of the crisis from the Middle East, and after the escalation of the conflict in Gaza. In the dispatch sent to SIPA, the Border Police of BiH, entitz and the cantonal Interior Offices and the Police of the Brčko District, the minister stated that all police agencies within their jurisdiction and in the area in which they operate should increase security measures, including the presence of its personnel, in locations such as public facilities of the Jewish people, facilities of the State of Israel, as well as Palestinian facilities[19].\n\nSome, including journalists from the media that published this story, questioned Nešić’s action, judging it to be politicized. However, Nešić’s action is far from alone. One media from neighboring Croatia – which is also read in BiH due to the absence of a language barrier – published an analysis in which they remind that Italy, France, Slovenia and Austria have raised the level of threat from terrorism, and that in “Hamas conquers Bosnia”, due to the wide support they Palestine and Gaza have among Bosnian Muslims, but also numerous others[20]. Same media reminds of the arrival of foreign fighters from Islamic countries in BiH. They recall the case of Bilal Bosnić, who was sentenced to seven years in prison in 2015, for inciting citizens to engage in terrorist activities. Bosnić was presented to the media as an informal leader of the Wahhabis in BiH. He was charged because, among other things, he organized terrorist groups to fight on the side of the Islamic State in Syria and Iraq[21].\n\nAlthough the problem of various types of terrorism, as well as the associated departure of BiH citizens to foreign battlefields, should not be minimized, the very fact that the example taken by this media is from the distant year 2015, shows that this topic is neither hot nor current in BiH. Another media outlet dealt with the departure of adventurers and the security challenge for BiH, and they counted “dozens” of fighters who had gone to fight in Syria and Ukraine in the past years. According to available testimonies, the motives of citizens of BiH who illegally join foreign armies are mostly religious and ideological. The Muslims of BiH went to war in Syria to support the rights of the Muslims there, while the Bosnian Orthodox today speak with equal passion about the importance of supporting the “Russian brothers”[22].\n\nAccording to the BiH laws, going to foreign battlefields is a criminal offense, but this does not prevent individuals and groups from taking risks. In 2014, the state authorities passed a law prohibiting travel to foreign battlefields, after the first wave of BiH citizens who went to the Syrian battlefield[23]. One study counted that 39 persons were legally convicted in BiH for terrorism, 14 of them for local activities, and the remaining 25 for being on the Syrian battlefield[24].\n\nHowever, trips to the Syrian-Iraqi battlefield are no longer current, and neither does the Ukrainian one, it seems, attract those who have favorites in that war, to the extent that they would move from their somewhat comfortable lives with security into the uncertainty of a war conflict. Because returning from such a war is also a challenge for the community to which returnees return, because it is normal for each of them to experience some kind of trauma, and they often return with psychological difficulties such as anxiety, excessive aggressiveness, depression, etc[25].\n\nSocial unrest\n\nThe last major unrest caused by economic reasons in BiH took place in 2014. Then the building of the Presidency of BiH was also on fire. From then until 2023, such massive and violent protests have not been recorded. And yet, from time to time various organized trade union groups, representatives of certain economic branches or specific organizations take to the streets. They demand their rights, most often related to collective agreements, salary issue, or some rights from labor-legal regulations that are denied to them by their employers.\n\nIn the past period, farmers took to the streets in the Federation of BiH, blocking roads with tractors, thus expressing dissatisfaction with the situation in this area[26]. Also, miners from other parts of FBiH came to Sarajevo, in front of the building of Elektroprivreda BiH, protesting the non-payment of earned wages[27]. Six trade unions of employees in public administration, healthcare, internal affairs and justice staged a protest march in Banja Luka in September and demanded from the Government of RS, as they claim, an agreed salary increase. The unions say that the Government violated the agreement from June last year, according to which nearly 55,000 workers were supposed to receive an average salary increase of around 160 marks (80 euro) this year[28].\n\nConclusion\n\nAs we can see, the security challenges faced by Bosnia and Herzegovina are not harmless. They are a combination of internal nationalist disagreements, external factors such as the migrant crisis, and regional and global phenomena such as radical terrorism or a difficult economic situation that can lead to a further decline in living standards and thus to social unrest. The worst case scenario would be if all the challenges happened at the same time, and over a long period of time. However, if we analyze, due to the permanent presence of the international community and other objective factors, we consider the assessment of potential security challenges that would mean conflicts in BiH to be unlikely.\n\n[1] What are the security challenges in the Federation of BiH: Extremist right-wing groups, the migrant crisis… https://radiosarajevo.ba/vijesti/bosna-i-hercegovina/koji-su-sigurnosni-izazovi-u-federaciji-bih-ekstremisticke-desnicarske-grupe-migrantska-kriza/518034#google_vignette\n\n[2] Bosnian Serb Protesters Wave Putin Portraits. https://www.rferl.org/a/bosnia-russia-putin-protest/32575585.html\n\n[3] Ibid.\n\n[4] Supporters of Bosnian Serb President Milorad Dodik stage protest with Putin flags. https://www.euronews.com/2023/09/02/supporters-of-bosnian-serb-president-milorad-dodik-stage-protest-with-putin-flags\n\n[5] The front in Ukraine is equal to the length of the inter-entity line: Is Dodik bluffing when he talks about secession?
