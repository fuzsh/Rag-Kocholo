        "text": "Acknowledgements\n\nThis report was prepared by an International Crisis Group team working out of the Sarajevo office.\n\nICG wishes to thank James Hooper of the Balkan Action Council and Stephen Schwartz, who gave generously of their time and editing skills. In addition, ICG wishes to thank numerous people in a variety of organisations currently working in Bosnia and Herzegovina who provided us with information and documents. These organisations include, but are not limited to: the Organisation for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE), the Office of the High Representative (OHR), the Stabilisation Force (SFOR), the United Nations Mission in Bosnia and Herzegovina (unmibh), the United Nations High Commission for Refugees (UNHCR), the Commission for Real Property Claims (CRPC), the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organisation (UNESCO), and the World Bank. It is to these people, who strive to implement the Dayton Peace Accords, as well as to the people of Bosnia and Herzegovina, that this report is dedicated.\n\nSarajevo, 28 October 1999\n\nExecutive Summary\n\nIn anticipation of the fourth anniversary on 21 November 1999 of the signing of the Dayton Peace Accords, this report presents a detailed analysis of the agreement and the future of the Bosnian peace process. The report assesses efforts to implement the agreement annex by annex, identifying obstacles to continued progress and setting out key choices facing international policymakers.\n\nA traditional peace treaty consists of a cease-fire and arms reduction and boundary demarcation agreements. Dayton went far beyond these goals to create a state, comprised of two multi-ethnic entities. Dayton's aim was to not only stop the fighting, but to reverse ethnic cleansing and provide a blueprint for a new, unified country.\n\nToday Bosnia and Herzegovina has three de facto mono-ethnic entities, three separate armies, three separate police forces, and a national government that exists mostly on paper and operates at the mercy of the entities. Indicted war criminals remain at large and political power is concentrated largely in the hands of hard line nationalists determined to obstruct international efforts to advance the peace process. In many areas, local political leaders have joined forces with police and local extremists to prevent refugees from returning to their pre-war homes. The effect has been to cement wartime ethnic cleansing and maintain ethnic cleansers in power within mono-ethnic political frameworks. The few successes of Dayton - the Central Bank, a common currency, common license plates, state symbols and customs reforms - are superficial and were imposed by the international community. Indeed, the only unqualified success has been the four-year absence of armed conflict.\n\nA thorough examination of the Dayton Peace Accords, annex by annex, indicates that the ethnic cleansers are winning the battle to shape post-war Bosnia. All in all, significant portions of Dayton remain unimplemented. In spite of the High Representative's recent energetic and long-awaited actions on refugee returns, it is too early to state whether or not they will translate into actual implementation. Local authorities continue to demand donor aid in return for partial co-operation. Dayton's fragile and limited achievements to date could now be threatened as donor aid starts to fall. The inability of donors to hold out the promise of aid could cause local leaders to be even more non-compliant than now. The severe economic downturn and negative GDP growth that a reduction in aid will cause can only aggravate social unrest. Pensions are in arrears, and estimates of unemployment range from 39 percent in the Federation to 50 percent in Republika Srpska. Social discontent has already burst into the open, with demonstrators regularly blocking highways and buildings. Ominously, in the past, many local politicians have channelled this unrest into nationalism.\n\nThe current policies for implementing Dayton are flawed, due to the refusal of the NATO-led international force (SFOR) to fulfil its mandate and act as an implementing agent, despite clear authorisation to do so under the terms of the agreement. In addition, two out of the three ethnic groups actively oppose Dayton, and are prepared to wait until such a time as the international community withdraws and the agreement can be laid to rest. Unless a way can be found to break the current deadlock, the agreement's only major success - peace - will be increasingly at risk. While peace was a worthy and admirable goal, it was the promise of implementation of certain key principles and the creation of a unified state that persuaded the Bosniaks in particular to sign the agreement in 1995. Unlike the Serbs and Croats, they demand a higher level of implementation of all the Dayton annexes throughout all three ethnic areas. The failure of current policies to ensure complete implementation could yet trigger renewed fighting, particularly as the international community starts to withdraw. As the 1998 Madrid Implementation Council noted, \"Bosnia and Herzegovina's structure remains fragile. Without the scaffolding of international support, it would collapse\".\n\nThe international community must now examine seriously its options for Bosnia and Herzegovina's future. These policy options include:\n\n1. Pulling out immediately;\n\n2. Maintaining the present approach;\n\n3. Rewriting the Dayton Peace Accords;\n\n4. Enforcing Dayton more robustly;\n\n5. Creating an international protectorate for Bosnia and Herzegovina.\n\nThe international community must decide if Dayton is worth salvaging, or whether a complete pullout is warranted, as isolationist forces in some countries urge. If the international community decides to pull out, it must be prepared for the very real possibility that the Serbs, Croats and Bosniaks will attempt to achieve their unrealised war aims through violence. All the hard-won progress of the last four years will be lost. If the international community chooses this option, it must decide if it is willing to pay the social, political, economic, and human costs associated with a renewed war in the Balkans, as well as the implications for broader pan-Balkan and European stability. If, on the other hand, the international community wishes to remain engaged in Bosnia, it must choose one of the remaining options, realising that some could also lead to renewed fighting.\n\nThe International Crisis Group does not believe that Option Two - maintaining the present approach - provides a viable basis for long-term peace in Bosnia. Option Three, while risking renewed fighting, could also lead to a positive reinterpretation of the political realities in place and lead to a lasting peace. Options Four and Five, while requiring a more focused long-term international presence, would lock in the gains made to date and create an environment conducive to the development of an international exit strategy, and the emergence of Bosnia as a self-sustaining economic and political unit. Option Four would require a more robust approach within the Dayton framework, both by SFOR and the Office of the High Representative (OHR), as well as more targeted approaches to aid. Option Five, while unpopular abroad, is very popular in Bosnia, and would enable the international community to correct some of Dayton's mistakes.\n\nSarajevo, 28 October, 1999\n\nI. Introduction: Dayton's Goals\n\nA. Purpose\n\nIn anticipation of the fourth anniversary (21 November 1999) of the signing of the Dayton Peace Accords (DPA), this report examines the level of implementation, annex by annex, of the General Framework Agreement for Peace in Bosnia and Herzegovina (GFAP). It shows that, over the course of four years, although the war has ended, significant portions of the DPA remain unimplemented, and under current policies, may remain so.\n\nA traditional peace treaty or cessation of hostilities would have consisted of cease-fire, arms reduction, and boundary demarcation agreements, the essence of Annexes 1-A, 1B, and 2. The November 1995 GFAP went far beyond these simple goals: it is a document designed to create a new country, the unified state of Bosnia and Herzegovina, comprised of two multi-ethnic entities. This unified state would have a functioning central government, hold democratic elections under international auspices, \"adopt and adhere to normal international human rights standards,\" and allow freedom of movement.[1] The state's human rights commission would enforce international human rights obligations. Displaced persons were to be allowed to return to their homes, or to be compensated for their loss in cases where return wasn't possible. Joint public corporations were to be established, as was a commission for the protection of national monuments. Indicted war criminals were to be arrested and turned over to The Hague, and all foreign fighters and soldiers were to leave the country. In short, Dayton's aim was to stop the fighting, reverse ethnic cleansing, and create a new, unified country. This has not occurred.\n\nToday's Bosnia and Herzegovina consists of three de facto mono-ethnic entities,[2] three separate armies, three separate police forces, and a national government that exists mostly on paper and operates at the mercy of the Entities. Ethnic leaders - such as Croatian President Franjo Tudman - continue to support the separate existence of this illegal three-entity system.[3] Indicted war criminals remain at large. The criteria for voter registration, written by and large by the international community, directly contradict the GFAP. As a result, nationalist political parties, including many of the ethnic cleansers who were responsible for the war in the first place, remain securely in power throughout the country. Nationalist extremists - often encouraged, organised and funded by the ruling political parties - still bomb and torch the homes of returning refugees in certain areas.[4] Corrupt police side with nationalist elements in their respective enclaves and sometimes openly support their activities.[5] Foreign fighters, such as Mujahadeen, still roam the country, and international terrorists are sheltered by local governments. Foreign governments continue to give direct support to military bodies. All this prevents refugees from returning to their pre-war homes, which cements the wartime ethnic cleansing and cleansers in power within mono-ethnic political frameworks. This was not what DPA intended.\n\nThere have been some successes under DPA: the Central Bank, a common currency, common license plates, state symbols, and the CAFAO-led Customs reforms. So too, SFOR has managed to keep the peace for three and a half years. But the one common factor among these successes is that all were forcibly imposed by the international community.\n\nOutside of the DPA framework, the efforts of the World Bank, UNHCR, USAID, the EU, and individual donor nations succeeded in reconstructing much of Bosnia's war-damaged public infrastructure. Today, Bosnia and Herzegovina has new roads, schools, hospitals, bridges, houses, and power lines, and in Sarajevo much of the wartime damage has been repaired.\n\nHowever in the process of reconstruction, Bosnia has become donor dependent. Were it not for donor aid - which may account for 30% of official GDP - economic growth would probably be negative.[6] Little private investment - foreign or domestic - has occurred in manufacturing. The overall investment climate appears far from hospitable, suffering from strangling bureaucracy, excessively high taxes, corruption, oppressive payment bureaux, and a wholly inefficient legal system. Even the American hamburger chain mcdonalds has been put off, and Volkswagen is experiencing difficulties at every step of the way.[7] Politicians appear more interested in staying in power, than in making the needed structural changes in the economy that will attract private investment.\n\nB. Annex by Annex\n\nWhen examined annex by annex, the Dayton Peace Accords present a sobering picture of non-compliance and non-implementation. The major success under DPA has been the cessation of hostilities and boundary demarcation. While a worthy and admirable goal, it was the promise of implementation of certain key principles and the creation of a unified state that persuaded the Bosniaks in particular to sign the peace. Unlike the Serbs and Croats, they expect full implementation of all the DPA annexes throughout all three ethnic areas.\n\nAnnex 1-A - the cease-fire aspects - is probably the most successful of all the annexes to date, yet still remains only partially implemented. Although peace has been maintained for almost four years, foreign military forces are still present throughout Bosnia and Herzegovina. These include Mujahadeen, Croatian, and Serb groups. NATO pays rent for many of its facilities to local political powerbrokers, and fails to live up to its enforcement potential under Article VI. Most troubling, war criminals still roam freely, in particular in Republika Srpska.\n\nAnnex 1-B - regional and sub-regional arms control - remains largely unimplemented, as much of its success depends on voluntary compliance, as well as the co-operation of the joint governmental bodies and organs outlined in Annex 4. Unfortunately, these bodies exist primarily on paper. As a result, military and confidence building measures between the former warring factions are largely non-existent.\n\nAnnex 2 - inter-entity boundaries and Brcko - has been somewhat implemented. Today the inter-entity boundaries are settled largely beyond doubt. Brcko implementation, however, remains problematic. Although much progress has occurred on paper, the new district still maintains three separate administrations, health care and education systems, pension systems, payment bureaux, and police forces.\n\nAnnex 3 - democratic elections - has been implemented clumsily, haphazardly, and in one crucially important area - voter registration - in contradiction of the DPA text. Implementation has been characterised by international appeasement of the ethnic cleansers, which has resulted in the ethnic cleansers cementing their power via the ballot box and with international approval. Operating with the framework required of it by the DPA constitution, the proposed Election Law could codify some of the mistakes made to date in implementing Annex 3.\n\nAnnex 4 - the constitution of Bosnia and Herzegovina - is unwieldy, clumsy, unworkable, and bears no relation to the reality of Bosnian political life. The central government institutions exist largely on paper, and are only as powerful as the entities allow them to be. The concept of \"constitutionality of nationalities\" permits legalised discrimination on the basis of ethnic background. Indeed, the entire constitution enshrines ethnic discrimination as a principle of law. The constitution, as it now stands, would not permit Bosnia and Herzegovina to join either the Council of Europe or the European Union without significant modification, unless the Council of Europe ignores its own Charter to allow bih to accede.\n\nAnnex 5 - inter-entity arbitration - is entirely unimplemented.\n\nAnnex 6 - human rights - goes largely unimplemented, as systematic discrimination continues throughout the country, in defiance of the Human Rights Commission, many of whose decisions and recommendations are ignored.\n\nAnnex 7 - refugee return - the crucial centrepiece of DPA, which permits all refugees and displaced persons to return to their pre-war place of residence, remains almost entirely unimplemented, with almost 1.2 million Bosnian displaced persons and refugees still seeking a permanent housing solution.[8] Return of Bosniaks and Croats to Republika Srpska equals less than 3% of all those ethnically cleansed from there, with the situation of minority return to Croat-controlled Herzegovina only marginally better. Minority refugee returns to Bosniak-controlled areas, while substantially better than for their Serb or Croat opposites, remain disappointingly low.\n\nAnnex 8 - the Commission to Preserve National Monuments - has achieved little. Although a Commission exists, almost four years after Dayton its work is still secret, due to fears the ethnic groups will destroy each other's monuments.\n\nAnnex 9 - joint corporations - is implemented only in small measure, primarily due to non-co-operation among the parties.\n\nAnnex 10 - civilian implementation - created the Office of the High Representative (OHR), and has been implemented only in as much as it has created a large international bureaucracy. Although given sweeping \"protectorate\"-style powers at several Peace Implementation Council meetings (Sintra and Bonn), the lack of an enforcement mechanism and the reliance on local co-operation renders the OHR largely powerless.\n\nAnnex 11 - the International Police Task Force (IPTF) - has created an enormous U.N. bureaucracy which lacks an enforcement mechanism, and has proven unable - in spite of numerous training programs - to change police behaviour in bih. A thorough examination of the Dayton Peace Accords, annex by annex, indicates that nearly four years after the 21 November 1995, signing in Dayton, Ohio, the ethnic cleansers have won: Bosnia is ethnically divided. All in all, significant portions of the treaty remain unimplemented. In the words of the Madrid Peace Implementation Council, \"Bosnia and Herzegovina's structure remains fragile. Without the scaffolding of international support, it would collapse.\"[9] Under current policies, an international community and NATO withdrawal would likely result in renewed fighting.\n\nII. Annex 1-A: Cease Fire and Mujahedeen\n\nOf all the annexes of the Dayton Peace Accords, Annex 1-A is - in addition to Annex 2 - one of the few annexes that has been largely implemented. Nonetheless, significant areas of Annex 1-A are not enforced, most notably those provisions concerning the presence of foreign forces (such as Mujahadeen) on Bosnian soil, armed civilian groups, and provisions which allow SFOR the right to use facilities without paying rent. More significantly, SFOR has largely ignored its authority to enforce the civilian aspects of DPA. This has proven catastrophic for the DPA, as Annex 1-A provides the only implementation mechanism in the entire treaty.\n\nA. Cessation of Hostilities\n\nPerhaps the greatest success of the DPA was the cessation of hostilities. As outlined in Articles I, II, III, IV, V, and VI, DPA has been largely successful. The war has stopped. Inter-entity violence has ended. Freedom of movement exists. The high visibility of NATO-led SFOR has made all three sides feel secure, knowing that an outside power could intervene to prevent renewed ethnic hostilities. It is the very presence of SFOR that gives the country the level of security and stability that has enabled the post-war reconstruction efforts to succeed, and has contributed to post-war economic growth. What foreign and domestic investment has taken place is due primarily to this stabilising influence. In this regard, the implementation of Annex 1-A has been quite successful. Without the presence of SFOR, all remaining annexes of DPA could not be implemented. And without SFOR, the country would likely slip back into war.\n\nYet, in spite of these successes, some aspects of Annex 1-A are not yet implemented.\n\nB. Armed Civilian Groups: Militia and Paramilitary\n\nAnnex 1-A, Article II:3 commits all sides to \"disarm and disband all armed civilian groups.\" In spite of this, a number of paramilitary formations still exist and function actively throughout bih, particularly in the RS. Several paramilitary units, including some from Prnjavor, Bijeljina, and Koraj appear to have been activated and sent to Kosovo to participate in ethnic cleansing during the NATO bombing of Yugoslavia. In addition there were the Zvornik-based White Eagles, allegedly controlled by SRS politician Mirko Blagojevic. Although the movements of these paramilitary groups were relatively well known, SFOR did nothing to stop either their departure to or return from Yugoslavia. In the Croat-controlled areas of western Herzegovina, particular concern is raised by the activities of the HVIDRA organisation, which, while nominally a group of war veterans and invalids, also appears to act as a paramilitary arm of the HDZ, in particular implementing radical actions intended to prevent minority refugee returns.[10] So too, a group known as the \"Black Shirts\" seems to have been active in Drvar.\n\nC. Foreign Troops: The Osama Bin Laden Connection\n\nArticle III:1-2 specifically states that all foreign forces \"shall be withdrawn, together with their equipment, from the territory of bih, within 30 days.\" Foreign forces include \"individual advisors, freedom fighters, trainers, volunteers, and personnel from neighbouring and other States.\"\n\nThis article is clearly not being implemented. The most recent and highly visible example of non-implementation was the arrest in Turkey of a Mehrez Amdouni, a member of Osama Bin Laden's terrorist organisation, who was travelling on a Bosnian passport. With the full knowledge of SFOR, local Bosnian officials permit Mujahadeen who fought in Bosnia during the war to reside in the Zavidovici-Maglaj region, particularly in the villages of Bocnja and Pehare. Many have received Bosnian citizenship and passports. Most of the Mujahadeen occupy Serb or Croat homes, and present a serious obstacle to refugee returns in the Zavidovici-Maglaj region. SFOR does not patrol these villages, as they fear attacks against their convoys. The Mujahadeen present a source of potential political and ethnic instability in central Bosnia, and have been linked to various terrorist attacks against Croats in the Travnik area and Mostar.[11] Some of these Mujahadeen may now be moving to the village of Svijetlica in the Doboj east area.\n\nThe wartime Bosnian Croat Army (HVO - Hrvatsko Vijece Obrane) still exists, and may also be considered to fall under the definition of the \"foreign forces\" prohibited under Article III, as it receives 100% of its financing from foreign sources, primarily Croatia.[12] This alone should qualify the HVO for consideration as a foreign army. In its recent judgement against Dusko Tadic and its argument against Tihomir Blaskic, The Hague tribunal declared the 1992-1995 war in Bosnia and Herzegovina to be an international conflict, and placed clear blame on FRY for waging a war against a sovereign country. Using this same logic, The Hague considered the Bosnian Serb Army (VRS - Vojska Republike Srpske) as an extension of the Yugoslav Army (VJ - Vojska Jugoslavije). Were The Hague to use similar logic against indicted Bosnian Croats, such as Vinko Martinovic \"Stela\" and Mladen Naletelic \"Tuta,\" then The Hague could legally consider the HVO as part of the Croatian Army. This logic is borne out by the recent promotions and transfers of high-ranking HVO generals into the Croatian regular army. If this is indeed the case, then the very existence of the HVO could present a clear contradiction of Annex I-A.\n\nSimilar to the HVO, the VRS continues to receive foreign financial support, all of it from Belgrade.[13] Officers from the VRS are trained in Yugoslavia and hold dual ranks in both the VJ and VRS. Shortly before his arrest for war crimes in Austria, the chief of staff of the VRS Momir Talic was promoted from the rank of Colonel to Lieutenant General in the VJ. In spite of Annex 1-A prohibitions, weapons are transferred between the two armies with regularity.[14] Under the aforementioned ruling by The Hague in the Blaskic case, the VRS too could be considered a \"foreign force\" under the precedent of international law, in contradiction of Annex 1-A.\n\nD. Who Pays the Rent?\n\nAppendix B to Annex 1-A clearly states that the government of the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina and the government of the Republic of Croatia \"shall, provide, free of cost, such facilities NATO needs for the preparation for and execution of the Operation.\" In spite of this, SFOR is paying rent to local authorities for properties which, under the DPA, they should be able to use for free. Although SFOR refuses to release data on this issue, it appears that in the hard line Serb nationalist enclave of Modrica, a company with close links to the local Mayor Novak Gojkovic reportedly collected 67,000 DM per month in cash from SFOR. Costs for the Slavonski Brod facilities in Croatia reportedly ran as high as 225,000 DEM per month. In Sarajevo the Energoinvest TAT facility charges rent to the German Army light armoured unit stationed there. In Lepenica near Tesanj the Danish Headquarters unit is reported to be paying rent. Local sources state that the U.S. Army commander at the now-closed Olovo base allegedly paid rent of 100,000 DEM per month in cash to the local mayor. Nordpol Brigade headquarters in Multi-national Division North claim to be the only SFOR base for which rent is not paid. Disturbingly, a common factor in much of the rent payment seems to be the transfer of cash to municipal officials by SFOR outside the normal municipal budget channels.\n\nE. War Criminals\n\nArticle X requires the Parties to \"co-operate fully with all entities involved in implementation of this peace settlement including the International Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia.\" To date, this article has enjoyed blatant non-compliance by two of the three ethnic groups, the Bosniaks being the only side that appears to have handed over its indicted. In addition, SFOR seems to have taken its duties in regard to arresting indicted war criminals less than seriously.\n\nTo date the International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia, located in The Hague, has indicted publicly 66 persons. An additional number of individuals are under secret indictment. To date, 32 of these individuals have found their way to The Hague. Of those arrested, 13 surrendered voluntarily, six were arrested outside Bosnia and Herzegovina, and SFOR arrested 13. The largest number of actions, which resulted in nine arrests and the death of one suspect, occurred in the sector under control of the British Army. The sector controlled by the U.S. Army has seen three arrests, while the French Army has to date managed to arrest only one suspect and kill a second.[15] Both the French and U.S. sectors contain large numbers of war criminals, including the Bosnian Serb war-time leader, Radovan Karadzic.\n\nToday war criminals remain at large in numerous areas of Republika Srpska and Croat controlled \"Herzeg-Bosna.\" Many of them work to prevent refugee returns in both directions, while maintaining control over their towns. Foca, Srebrenica, and Prnjavor are but a few areas frequently mentioned. The \"big fish,\" such as Radovan Karadzic and former post-Dayton bih Presidency member Momcilo Krajisnik[16] still control politics in substantial parts of RS. Both French and U.S. forces have come under criticism for their unwillingness to arrest war criminals. Both the French and U.S. Armies claim they are unaware of the location of war criminals. Yet, as seen by U.S. General Montgomery Meigs' evasive answers regarding the arrest of war criminals at his final press conference,[17] the problem of arresting war criminals is neither one of logistics nor of lack of information. Rather, it is a question of political will in the NATO capitals. As long as indicted individuals are permitted to remain at large, their presence will have a chilling effect on refugee return, ethnic and political integration, and long-term regional stability.\n\nF. The Fear of Body Bags: Why Dayton Isn't Working\n\nArticle X of Annex 1-A commits the parties to \"co-operate fully with all entities involved in the implementation of this peace settlement, or which are otherwise authorised by the United Nations Security Council, including the International Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia.\" As will be shown throughout the remainder of this report, this co-operation is not occurring. The primary reason is that the only enforcement mechanism in the entire DPA is found in Article VI:3. This article states clearly that IFOR (today's SFOR) has the right \"to help create secure conditions for the conduct by others of other tasks associated with the peace settlement to assist the UNHCR and other international organisations in their humanitarian missions...to observe and prevent interference with the movement of civilian populations, refugees and DP's, and to respond appropriately to deliberate violence to life and person.\" This article is the key to the full implementation of the DPA.\n\nSince early 1996 first IFOR and then SFOR have refused to fulfil this function. The problem is primarily one of political will, as the NATO capitals do not wish to make the difficult political decisions necessary to enforce the DPA entirely, as it might result in NATO casualties. As a result, the international community has had to rely on the good will of local officials to voluntarily comply with implementation of the DPA. As will be shown later in this report, the lack of local co-operation with Annexes 3 through 11, the lack of co-operation with Article X of Annex 1-A, and the lack of an enforcement mechanism, have prevented the organisations responsible for implementing the civilian aspects of the DPA (Annexes 3-11) from fulfilling their responsibilities.\n\nIn early 1999 the U.S. Army came out with a FRAGOP (operational order) entitled Pegasus Sunrise, which provided a long-awaited initial step in the direction of increased SFOR engagement. Pegasus Sunrise permitted U.S. Army personnel for the first time to provide logistical support to the OHR's Return and Reconstruction Task Force (RRTF). Nonetheless, logistical support is, in and of itself insufficient to implement DPA, and much more aggressive action by SFOR will be required if implementation is to succeed. Such action would include arresting persons indicted for war crimes, and removing persons from office who obstruct implementation of DPA. Recent actions by SFOR in Mostar on 14 October, 1999, indicate a tentative, albeit hesitant step in the proper direction.[18] Yet whether or not this is an aberration is unknown.\n\nIn essence, the international community's failure to implement DPA is primarily political in nature. NATO governments have yet to display the will to enforce DPA obligations, due to the fear of casualties. This has weakened the hand of key international officials assigned to facilitate implementation in Bosnia. Dayton is failing, primarily due to SFOR's non-compliance.\n\nIII. Annex 1-B: Regional Stabilization\n\nA. Purpose\n\nTo secure lasting regional stability, DPA required specific security measures from the Republic of Croatia, Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, and Bosnia and Herzegovina. These included \"new forms of transparency and force levels at the lowest numbers consistent with the Parties' respective security and the need to avoid an arms race in the region.\"[19] Stability was to be achieved through various confidence and security building measures, and measures for sub-regional arms control that would eventually rise to the level of a regional arms control agreement. In marked contrast to Annex 1-A and the remainder of DPA, compliance with Annex 1-B was made voluntary, and parties could withdraw anytime after December 1999.\n\nThe OSCE Department of Regional Stabilisation (DRS) is tasked to assist with the implementation of Article II, Article IV and the establishment of the conditions for eventual implementation of Article V.[20] The DRS has put together a wide range of activities, primarily concentrating on the facilitation and execution of arms control verification Inspections, verification of information, and communication between the entity armed forces. Furthermore, various seminars, training programs and courses are being organised to bring former warring factions together, or at least provide a minimum of communication and co-ordination. These include efforts to bring about \"democratisation\" of the armed forces, and introduce a code of military conduct for mid and senior-level officers. Four years after Dayton, Article V negotiations are still under way in Vienna, and as of yet there is no clear mandate to begin implementation. As a result, Article V goes unimplemented.\n\nAlthough OSCE has developed and employed a comprehensive policy followed by concrete measures to facilitate the implementation of the Articles, II, IV, success in implementation has been marginal. This is due in large part to the unwillingness of the parties to work together. Although military personnel express the willingness to co-operate, their political leaders block most efforts at compliance. Foreign financial support for the HVO prevents the unification of the Federation Army. Even more troubling, in what may mark the beginning of a local arms race, both the Bosniak Army of bih and the Serb VRS planned to increase their 1999 military budgets substantially. As of now it appears budget shortfalls may have prevented these increases, and recent meetings between the three parties and the Standing Committee on Military Matters called for a reduction in \"military potential\" by as much as 15% by the end of 1999.[21]\n\nB. Confidence and Security Building Measures\n\nArticle II of Annex 1-B provides for the RBIH, FBIH and RS, under OSCE auspices, \"to agree upon a series of measures to enhance mutual confidence and reduce risk of conflict, drawing fully upon the 1994 Vienna Document of the negotiations on Confidence-and Security-Building measures of the OSCE\".[22] Clearly, creating confidence between the former warring factions is not an easy task.\n\nThe OSCE has implemented 15 measures under Article II, which include the exchange of information on military assets, command structures and military activities, the restriction of military deployment and exercises, the prohibition of reintroducing foreign forces, the withdrawal of forces and heavy weapons, and monitoring weapons manufacturing. To supervise these activities, a Joint Consultative Commission (JCC) was created, consisting of three delegations, one from RS, one from the Federation, and one from the bih joint institutions. The OSCE Chairman-in-Office for Article II and IV chairs the JCC. The basic aim of these measures was to establish transparency and initiate processes of democratising control of the armed forces.\n\nC. Implementation\n\nDue in part to a slow start, numerous problems exist, from the Military Liaison Missions to the Standing Committee on Military Matters. The Military Liaison Missions between the Parties were not created until June 1998, and as of yet, they do not function properly. Influenced by political party control, representatives from the various armies have shown no real desire to co-operate and overcome practical problems, as they tend to place responsibility for implementation on OSCE. The only real progress has occurred in the number of inspections, 185 to date.[23] In reality, much of Annex 1-B depends on the proper functioning of the central government and institutions created under Annex 4, particularly the Presidency.\n\nD. The Standing Committee on Military Matters\n\nUnder Annex 4 the joint Presidency was to create a Standing Committee on Military Matters (SCMM), which would enable the members of the Presidency to co-ordinate the activities of the Armed Forces. Although this does not fall under Annex 1-A, the lack of a fully functional SCMM hampers OSCE efforts to implement Articles II and IV of Annex 1-A. The SCMM is only as effective as the central government organs, as \"the Members of the Presidency shall be members of the Standing Committee.\"[24] Perhaps as a reflection of the overall problems with the central government, the SCMM has not been functioning at all. Lack of progress in this arena caused the Madrid PIC to recommend \"taking steps together with the Presidency and the entities towards establishing a common security policy and a State dimension for defence. As a part of this the SCMM is to be strengthened with respect to the Constitution.\"[25]\n\nIn spite of the PIC recommendation, the SCMM did not begin to function until July 1999, and only then following intense international community pressure. The SCMM now has a permanent Secretariat comprised of top army officers.\n\nAll efforts to establish security and defence begin and end at the level of the three de facto entities. If it were two entities, a bipolar configuration would provide some balance. However, with the practical existence of three separate armies, two of which are in theory unified under the Federation Army, efforts at stabilisation and confidence building are bound to meet with limited success, at best.\n\nE. The Federation Armies: HVO and abih\n\nProblems associated with the Federation Army are indicative and symptomatic of problems in other areas of multi-ethnic relations throughout not only the Federation, but also Bosnia and Herzegovina. Although the Croat and Bosniak forces share common uniform patches, the units are ethnically segregated and under separate ethnic chains of command. Despite the fact that the Federation Army is supervised and inspected by SFOR, and its training directly financed by the U.S. through an MPRI-supervised program,[26] it is ethnically politicised. All personnel are appointed through the two ruling ethnic parties, SDA and HDZ. Criteria for military command typically ignore education or professional experience. Rather, party loyalty has become the primary criteria for command in the Federation Army.\n\nThe reasons for this was explained by the Federation Defence Minister, Miroslav Prce:\n\n\"The Croat side does not support a unified army in bih, because we do not want to create another 'mini former JNA' that had consisted of diverse religious, national and cultural characteristics. It may be presumed that it [the army] would be a permanent source of conflict. It seems to me that we have changed the beliefs of all those world elements that wanted to create a unified army of bih: something like that will never happen. We are searching for new concepts, for example co-operation on the humanitarian level, joint participation under UN, a minimum of joint functions, but not joint units because it would be unrealistic at this particular moment.\"[27]\n\nGeneral Rasim Delic, nominally the commander of the Federation Army, does not select the officers who work in the Joint HQ, not even those of Bosniak nationality. Instead, this is done by the SDA according to political criteria. Under these criteria it appears more important that an officer attend the mosque on a regular basis, than have military expertise. Formally, these officers are not members of the SDA; however, they act as if they are.[28]\n\nDuality is obvious in the military hierarchy and the chain of command. When General Delic is absent on leave, he is replaced not by his deputy, the Croat General Curcic, but by the Bosniak general Atif Dudakovic. The same occurs with General Curcic, who is replaced not by his deputy Dudakovic, but by an officer of Croat nationality. This policy was decided not in the Joint HQ of the Federation Army, but rather by the SDA and HDZ.[29] The influence of the two political parties, orchestrated by the members of the Presidency, creates further animosities and obstacles, which run contrary to confidence building or the creation of a functional modern army. The fact that the armies are unified only at the Federation level, and maintain two parallel chains of command as well as ethnically pure units, contributes to this problem. Introducing parliamentary oversight over the army is one of the OSCE's objectives. Unfortunately, this has yet to occur.\n\nF. Funding an Arms Race?\n\nAlthough \"transparency\" is a commonly used word in Bosnia these days, it is difficult to understand how defence budgets are financed. It appears that at least 40% of the Federation's Bosniak budget goes toward the military. In addition to this, other sources of outside financing exist, which may or may not be undisclosed. According to documents prepared by the parties in accordance with Annex 1-B, substantial amounts of foreign military aid are entering Bosnia and Herzegovina to arm and train all three sides. Even more troubling, the Bosniaks and Bosnian Serbs appear to be increasing their military spending by at least 30% each.[30]\n\nThe Bosniak Army of bih reported that it received 110,796,813 DEM (40% of its total military budget) in foreign military support during 1998. This included funds spent on MPRI by the U.S. government, as well as donations from Brunei, Saudi Arabia, United Arab Emirates, Kuwait, and Malaysia. Of this amount, at least 73,299,079 DEM was used for weapons procurement. For 1999 the Army of bih planned to increase overall military expenditures by 32% to 367,900,000 DEM. Because the level of foreign military aid was to drop to 64,332,925 DEM in 1999, this would mean a substantial increase in revenues from local sources.\n\nThe Croat HVO received foreign military support in 1998 equal to 100% of its entire military budget, 141,548,099 DEM, of which 83% (117,200,000 DEM) came from Croatia. In fact, the HVO appears to have no source of funding inside Bosnia and Herzegovina, which may place it in violation of Annex 1-A's prohibition against \"foreign forces.\" The HVO also received military aid from Brunei, Saudi Arabia, United Arab Emirates, Kuwait, and Malaysia, but at only one third the level given to the Army of BiH.[31] For 1999 the HVO planned a 14% reduction in funding from Croatia, as well as a 10% reduction in foreign military aid, for a total of 127,252,067 DEM. This continued flow of foreign support keeps the HVO artificially alive and prevents the creation of a unified Federation Army.\n\nThe VRS appears to be in much poorer financial and military health than the Federation armies, but it does have a unified chain of command. In 1998 the VRS received 27,988,846 DEM (38% of its total military budget) in foreign military support, all of it coming from Yugoslavia. The same amount is planned for 1999, although it is uncertain how the NATO bombing of FRY will affect levels of funding. In spite of a poor economy, the VRS planned to increase overall military expenditures by approximately 30% to 94,075,699 DEM in 1999.\n\nWhether or not the increased Serb and Bosniak spending marks the beginning of an arms race appears doubtful, as all sides are faced with new budget realities, and have agreed to recommend 15% reductions in \"military potential.\"[32] Nonetheless, the relatively high levels of weaponry in a country facing no external threats should prove troubling, as well as contradictory to the spirit of Dayton.\n\nAll three parties are fully aware of concessions and compromises they should make in order to create effective professional military establishments. Interest for programs, such as the NATO Partnership for Peace, is high among the three Bosnian armies. However, upon learning that it must be a state-level responsibility, this interest fades. All three sides show an extreme lack of initiative in matters of co-operation. Religious diversity, rather than being minimised, is misused to create even deeper animosity and distrust. Given these problems, which are coupled with diametrically opposed political goals, the goals and objectives of the DPA appear unachievable in the foreseeable future.\n\nG. Sub-regional Arms Control\n\nThe Agreement on Sub-regional Arms Control signed in Florence in June 1996 by the State of Bosnia and Herzegovina, the Federation of bih, Republika Srpska, the Republic of Croatia and the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia was a consequence of Article IV. The overall purpose of Article IV was to create a balance of heavy armaments, by limiting holdings. Under the Florence agreement, the parties are obliged to exchange information on weapons covered under the agreement, reduce holdings to agreed levels, and verify the levels of holdings.[33]\n\nUnder this system, the parties inspect each other's holdings. This got off to a slow start, because the parties could not separate political from practical military issues,[34] data on military forces was inaccurate, and the parties did not notify the OSCE of changes of holdings of 10% or more, as required under the Florence agreement. Over time, however, things have improved somewhat.[35]\n\nArmaments covered and limited by the Florence agreement include combat aircraft, attack helicopters, battle tanks, armoured combat vehicles and artillery pieces with diameters of 75mm or greater, including mortars. Ceilings have generally been met. Most of the arms that exceeded the limits had been destroyed, but some discrepancies, which fall under the category of \"historical collections,\" and arms held by the Ministry of Interior - special police units - present problems. In spite of these difficulties, this is the only portion of Annex 1-B that has met with general compliance.\n\nH. Agreement on Regional Arms Control\n\n\"The OSCE will assist the Parties by designating a special representative to help organise and conduct negotiations under the auspices of the OSCE Forum on Security and Co-operation (\"FSC\") with the goal of establishing a regional balance in and around former Yugoslavia.\"[36] This article has never been implemented and the participating countries have never been identified. The political intricacies of Balkan politics, currently focused on the potential for political instability emanating from Milosevic's Serbia, means that most Balkan countries are hesitant to embrace arms control.\n\nThe implications of the Kosovo crisis and recommendations rising from the Stability Pact may prove an incentive for the implementation of this article. Nonetheless, the fact remains that Article V is unimplemented.\n\nIV. Annex 2: Boundaries and Brcko\n\nA. Boundaries\n\nThe majority of this annex - Articles I through IV, and Articles VI and VII - deals with the demarcation of the Inter-entity Boundary Line (IEBL). As such, implementation appears complete. The IEBL is well defined, and the only disputes appear to be extremely minor in detail, concerning individual homes whose owners are upset that that they were left a few meters on the \"wrong\" side of the IEBL.\n\nB. Brcko: A United District?\n\nUnable to settle the issue of Brcko at Dayton, the parties committed in Article V to submit the issue to binding arbitration. Although the arbitration was to occur within one year of the signing of DPA, it was delayed repeatedly until February 8, 1999, primarily due to international fears that a decision either way could lead to renewed fighting.[37]\n\nThe arbitrator, Roberts Owen handed down the final award on March 5, 1999. In it he proclaimed Brcko a shared \"condominium\" between the Federation and Republika Srpska, creating a district that encompassed the entire pre-war Brcko municipality. In this decision Owen united areas which were under the control of the HVO, Bosnia Army of Bosnia and Herzegovina, and the VRS.[38]\n\nIn spite of the arbitration decision, the three ethnic enclaves within the new Brcko District maintain their own tax collection, tax distribution, health care, police, education, and administrative functions. Refugee return has taken place by and large within the Zone of Separation (ZOS). Returns to the Brcko town centre are still fraught with danger. The OHR office responsible for Brcko is handicapped by the lack of an enforcement mechanism, and has thus far proven unable to effectively integrate the three ethnically controlled areas within the district. Although the Federation expresses willingness to see implementation of this decision, Republika Srpska continues to actively obstruct.[39] As of yet, no clear target has been set for Brcko's final integration.\n\nV. Annex 3: Elections\n\nA. The Failure of \"Democratic\" Elections\n\nOne of DPA's biggest flaws was its insistence on early elections in a war-torn country with no democratic tradition. Predictably, all post war elections have returned nationalist leaders and parties to office. In many instances these votes mirrored the 1990 election results. In the Federation opposition parties were marginalised and remain ineffective to this day, while in Republika Srpska, not a single party questions Serb ultra-nationalism.[40] In a move that still haunts Bosnian elections, the OSCE-led Provisional Election Commission (PEC) rewarded the ethnic cleansers during the writing of the 1996 and 1997 election rules, by permitting the ruling parties to ethnically gerrymander and pack voting districts where they had only a minority presence prior to the war.\n\nBoth entities have diametrically-opposed views on the crucial issue of who should be allowed vote for what municipality and entity. Republika Srpska wants only those RS citizens currently living in the RS (over a million Serbs and less than 50,000 minorities) to have the right to vote for RS government institutions. As such RS officials are completely opposed to: a) absentee voting; b) out-of-country voting; or, more bluntly, the right of ethnically-cleansed Bosniaks and Croats to have any political voice in Republika Srpska. In this regard they directly and openly oppose Article IV of Annex 3. The Bosniaks believe that all those expelled from their homes during the war should have the right to vote for their pre-war Municipalities. The central-Bosnian Croats largely share this belief. However this has more to do with the fact that parallel institutions dominate the contested Cantons 6 and 7, and it is easier for the Federation's Bosniak and Croat partners to come to uneasy trade-offs. The Herzegovinian Croats share opinions similar to those of the Serbs.\n\nImplementation of election results is problematic. In numerous instances democratically elected officials are either unable to take office due to obstruction from hostile ethnic majorities occupying the municipality, or are sidelined from real decision-making when they are actually able to occupy office. Rarely does the international community take action to solve such problems. Today Bosniaks vote for Bosniaks, Serbs for Serbs, and Croats for Croats. The system of voting and ethnic gerrymandering render the concept of a multi-ethnic society a farce. Its impact on refugee return and the long-term future of Bosnia and Herzegovina cannot be underestimated. The new draft Election Law - forced to operate within the framework of the DPA Constitution (Annex 4), will only cement what is now temporary. The outcome will be the permanent enthronement of a de facto three-entity system based on mono-ethnic voting blocks.\n\nB. The Fraudulent 1996 Elections: Déjà vu From 1990\n\nDPA's architects decided to hold general elections as soon as possible after the end of the war \"in order to lay the foundation for representative government and ensure the progressive achievement of democratic goals throughout BiH.\"[41] The general elections were to take place \"on a date...no later than nine months after entry into force (of the Agreement).\"[42] DPA gave the Parties the responsibility to \"ensure that conditions exist for the organisation of free and fair elections, in particular a politically neutral environment...ensure freedom of expression and of the press...allow and encourage freedom of association.\"[43] DPA tasked the OSCE with \"supervising\" the \"preparation and conduct of elections,\"[44] and with establishing a Provisional Election Commission (PEC) to formulate electoral rules.[45] Annex 3 also foresaw that by election day the return of refugees would \"already be well underway.\"[46]\n\nThe 1996 general elections did not live up to the lofty expectations of DPA.[47] The parties did not honour their commitment to \"ensure that conditions exist for the organisation of free and fair elections,\" as they actively intimidated voters of their own and other ethnic groups. The limited voter registration process was characterised by intimidation of displaced persons and refugees to register to vote for their current, or future intended, municipalities, rather than their pre-war municipalities.[48] So widespread was the intimidation and registration fraud among Bosnian Serb refugees in Yugoslavia that it led to the postponement of the municipal ballot across BiH.[49] The campaign was dominated by appalling nationalist propaganda on all state-controlled (i.e. Ethnic party-controlled) TV and radio stations.[50] BiH was saturated with SDA, HDZ and SDS posters and leaflets, while the three ruling parties prevented the opposition parties from gaining access to the media. Widespread intimidation and terrorist attacks were directed against opposition parties and figures in all three ethnically controlled territories. And tellingly, refugee return had not yet begun.\n\nIf one rejects the theory that the very act of voting has a democratising effect on a non-democratic country, then the flawed 1996 general elections in effect turned into a glorified ethnic head count, and proved dangerously counterproductive. In spite of many warnings from senior international community figures - including the Chairman-in-Office of OSCE[51] - that the conditions for free and fair elections were not present, the Contact Group pressured the OSCE to move ahead, so as to demonstrate progress in implementing DPA.[52] The OSCE's lack of experience in organising and preparing for the elections played into the hands of the ruling nationalist parties, who threatened boycotts or lack of co-operation to get their way on the OSCE-established municipal level Local Election Commissions.[53]\n\nThe 1996 general elections produced similar results to the first multiparty elections in 1990, in that the HDZ, SDS, and SDA secured their grip on power. This occurred because the elections system - and the DPA Constitution - did not force the SDA, HDZ or SDS to compete for votes among other ethnic groups. As in 1990, Croats voted for Croats, Serbs for Serbs, and Bosniaks for Bosniaks. Except this time the vote was charged with ethnic hatreds fuelled by three and a half years of war.\n\nOn election day, problems with voters' lists abounded, with as many as 100,000 voters turned away from polling stations. Widespread fraud resulted in a voter turnout of 105% of the eligible electorate. So widespread was voter fraud that the Election Appeals Sub-Commission (EASC) issued an Interim Judgement on 25 September 1999 that the voting had \"a significant possibility of double voting, other forms of fraud, or counting irregularities.\"[54] The EASC recommended a complete recount of all votes cast, which the PEC rejected. One week after certifying the election results, the OSCE hastily destroyed all ballots cast, thus rendering any independent investigation impossible.[55] In essence, the 1996 general elections gave the stamp of approval of \"democratic\" legitimacy to many of those who had led BiH into the war, and whose wartime behaviour left many of them with the reputation of gangsters, ethnic cleansers and war criminals. Some observers now accept that it was a fundamental error to hold elections in BiH so soon after the end of the war.[56]\n\nC. The 1997 Elections: Gerrymandering Dayton To Death\n\nFor the 1997 municipal elections the OSCE planned a nation-wide registration system. This predictably turned into a giant process of ethnically motivated election engineering.[57] Although Article IV required all citizens of Bosnia and Herzegovina (\"as a general rule\") to vote in their 1991 municipality,[58] the OSCE's Provisional Election Commission (PEC) interpreted this differently. The PEC unilaterally changed the 1991 residency requirement date to 31 July 1996, making a new \"general rule\" that you vote where you live. Anyone who could prove he lived in his new municipality prior to 31 July 1996, could cast a ballot for elections in that new municipality. As all ethnically motivated population movements and ethnic cleansing occurred significantly prior to this late date, the \"proof of residence\" process became meaningless.\n\nThe message to dps and refugees was clear: you could vote either for your pre-war municipality, where you were now in the ethnic minority, or you could vote in your new municipality in order to nullify the voting power of majority groups ethnically-cleansed from your new region. The OSCE openly supported this policy of ethnic engineering and permitted large numbers of displaced persons in the RS and in Croat-controlled areas, to register en masse to vote in their current municipality, thus cementing war time ethnic cleansing.[59] This made it difficult if not impossible for the pre-war majority ethnic groups, particularly Bosniaks, to win majorities in city councils and speed up their return in accordance with Annex 7. Power that was won through ethnic cleansing was now legitimised by the OSCE interpretation of Article IV.\n\nAs a result, during the 1997 municipal elections ruling nationalist parties won 129 out of the 136 municipalities that their ethnic groups controlled militarily. This occurred in spite of OSCE financial support to select opposition parties, which totalled $1.5 million, one third less than was spent for similar purposes in 1996.[60] Political parties representing nationalities ethnically cleansed from the RS - such as the SDA - won only one Municipal Assembly in all of the RS, Srebrenica.\n\nUnder the new \"general rule,\" by the end of the 1997 voter registration period, 219,000 dps (19% of RS electorate) living in RS had registered to vote in their current municipalities. This represented approximately 65.2% of all DP voters residing in RS.[61] In contrast, in the Federation only 55,000 dps (4% of Federation electorate) had registered to vote in their current municipality. These represented 44.7% of all Federation DP voters,[62] most of whom appear to have been Croats.\n\nBy the end of voter registration it had become clear that only a maximum of eight municipalities might be able to switch hands, of which only six actually did. Serb packing of newly arrived Displaced Person voters ensured that 19 municipalities in RS would \"stay Serb,\" even though the original (1991) Serbs from those municipalities represented only a minority of voters who registered to vote. These municipalities included Doboj, Derventa, Bosanski Brod, Prijedor, Brcko, Rogatica, Zvornik, Modrica, Kotor Varos, Vlasenica and Vukosavlje.[63] In a similar fashion, Croat voter packing ensured that Stolac and Capljina \"stayed Croat.\"[64]\n\nThe remaining RS municipalities were won exclusively by the ultra-nationalist SDS or SRS parties, or, in the western half of RS by a coalition of smaller Serb parties, including the SPRS and SNSD. In the Federation, exceptions to nationalist rule were Drvar, Bosansko Grahovo, Glamoc and Bosanski Petrovac, which political organisations of Serb dps won, as well as Tuzla.[65]\n\nBecause the Croats and Serbs packed voters into their new municipalities,[66] the elections themselves were hardly necessary: one could have predicted most of the results from UNHCR figures on DP movements. Thus, the ruling ethnic group, the Local Election Commissions, and the parties in the municipalities knew in advance of the registration period whether or not they would have to resort to fraud to pack in more of their own voters. At the end of registration, whichever ethnic group had the greater number of registered voters was certain to win. This encouraged widespread fraud in order to increase voter numbers.\n\nInstances of fraud are most clearly seen in the 13 decisions on voter registration fraud handed down by the OSCE-created Election Appeals Sub-Commission in the summer of 1997.[67] These decisions dealt with issues ranging from falsification of documents (the SDS in 7 RS Municipalities, ME-049, 99-IMP-04; the HDZ in Jajce, ME-065), to preventing of dps of one's own ethnic group from registering for their pre-war municipality (the HDZ in Capljina, ME-058). The Drvar Croats engaged in intimidation to prevent minorities from registering (ME-050). Massive HDZ fraud was uncovered and punished by the OSCE in Zepce.[68] All these voter registration fraud-related decisions were handed down in municipalities where wartime movements of displaced persons suggested the results would be tight.\n\nIn spite of the OSCE ruling, which enabled the RS and the HDZ to conduct pre-election ethnic engineering, in the one instance in Republika Srpska where local ethnic officials were unable to ethnically gerrymander the vote, Srebrenica, the international community failed to support the democratically elected officials. When rock-throwing Serb's greeted OSCE officials in November 1997 at the inauguration of the Srebrenica Municipal Assembly, the OSCE held off for over a year in implementing the election results. Not until May 1999, following the Bosniak CD Coalition's success in the 1997 Municipal Assembly elections, was the OSCE able to win Serb acquiescence to a multi-ethnic administration. And this occurred only due to intense pressure from Milorad Dodik and the hard work and talent of individual OSCE officials. The fact that this deal took so long highlights the inability - and unwillingness - of the international community to force Bosnians to comply with the DPA. It is worth noting that, in spite of Annex 3's declaration that \"the return of refugees should already be underway\" by election day in 1996, as of the publication date of this report in late October 1999, none have yet returned to Srebrenica.\n\nD. OSCE Intervention\n\nHoping to prevent a nationalist sweep of the 1997 municipal elections, similar to that which occurred in 1996, the PEC passed a controversial new rule for the 1997 municipal elections, Article 235.5(4)(b). This rule stated that, as part of the process of successful installation of elected officials, minority parties would have to be represented in all levels of the Municipal Assembly or Council. Prior to the elections, the rule stated that representation would be proportional to the number of seats won in the Council or Assembly. But the PEC dropped this requirement in the face of several obstacles. First, it became obvious that parties with an overall majority simply wouldn't accept it. Second, the body created to judge the implementation of the elections' results, the National Elections Results Implementation Committee (NERIC), realised it would be impossible to decide which positions in the local government would be equivalent to, for example, 40% of the seats in the local council.\n\nIn practice, OSCE monitors overseeing implementation in the field had no authority to adjudicate. Farcical situations developed throughout the country, as nationalist majority parties tried to ascertain from OSCE the minimum representation they had to offer minority parties (of a different ethnic group) in order to receive the final certification approval of the PEC and the OSCE Head of Mission. No answers were ever forthcoming, other than that the PEC would decide, in retrospect, as to whether the rule had been respected. After months of main office delay, many OSCE field officers were forced to adopt a role that had not been envisaged for them. This was to actively mediate and threaten parties, and in effect, to decide themselves which positions the \"majority\" parties would have to give the \"minority\" parties. The winning \"majority\" parties always complained that pure democracy meant 50% + 1 vote was sufficient to take all power in most modern political systems. They claimed that forcing winning parties to share power with the losing parties was to make a mockery of election results.\n\nE. The 1998 Election: Poplasen Wins\n\nThe 1998 General elections did not move Bosnia and Herzegovina closer to real DPA implementation. Hard-line (non)Bosnian Serb Nikola Poplasen, with a \"decorated\" war career as a Cetnik paramilitary leader, was elected President of RS, the international community's open support for incumbent Biljana Plavsic being as much a factor in Poplasen's victory as any other. In the wake of the Poplasen victory, the OSCE issued pie charts to demonstrate that some progress had occurred. In this instance progress was measured by how much ground the ruling nationalist parties had (or hadn't) lost.[69]\n\nDuring 1998 it became obvious that OSCE was not acting as the impartial international referee envisioned by DPA. Rather, it was actively involved in the international community's efforts to unseat the SDA, HDZ and the Serb nationalist block, most notably the SDS and SRS.[70]\n\nIn spite of a $39 million election budget, hundreds of polling stations opened late on polling day in September 1998, due to massive errors in the OSCE-produced voters' lists. On the first day at least 41 polling stations never opened, while others opened late. In Doboj municipality alone, the OSCE and the Local Election Commission estimated that up to 3,000 people[71] were disenfranchised by the late opening of 41 of the 43 polling stations in that municipality. Many villagers walked kilometres to polling stations that were closed for unexplained reasons, waited for hours, returned home and never returned again.\n\nF. The Potemkin Village Of Multi-ethnic Administration\n\nToday the facade of what the international community calls \"multi-ethnic administration\" is a farce in most BiH municipalities. Ethnic minority officials occupy either meaningless or nominally powerful positions, where they are sidelined and isolated from decision-making. In effect, they are there because the OSCE put them there, and as soon as the international community turns its back, they will certainly be removed. Some of these minority officials - fearing for their safety - live in a different municipality where their majority group holds power, and must travel long distances.[72] The dangers associated with minority officials working and living in a hostile environment are most clearly seen in the October 7, 1999, assassination attempt of Munib Hasanovic, the assistant secretary of the Srebrenica Municipality, who was brutally beaten and stabbed while in the municipal building restroom.[73] Hasanovic and other Bosniaks had been the subject of previous threats from hard line Serbs, and had received no support from the OHR representative in Srebrenica, Bent Jensen.\n\nYoung, educated minorities are usually disinterested in giving up career opportunities among their own ethnic group in order to take meaningless low paying jobs in a hostile municipality, where they have no guarantee of returning to their pre-war property.[74] When international community donors visit, the ruling nationalist officials often parade minority officials before the visiting foreigners in order to cultivate an image of a non-existent, co-operative, multi-ethnic municipality.\n\nIn Odzak/Vukosavlje, where the SDS defeated the KCD BiH coalition by 73 votes, and where seat distribution is 18 to 17 in favour of the SDS, the Bosniaks occupy three positions.[75] If occupied by Serbs, these would be quite influential, particularly the Secretary of Social Affairs, who holds responsibility for issues including both displaced persons and education. However, both the Bosniak Secretary of Social Affairs and the Bosniak Vice-president of the Executive Board have not yet taken up their positions, as hard-line Vukosavlje SDS Mayor Jovisa Kovacevic stalls on issues such as office space, budget, salaries, etc. In spite of numerous interventions by OSCE personnel, and in spite of the fact that both men live in Odzak, less than 10 minutes drive from Vukosavlje, they are unable to assume their functions. In the municipal elections of 1997 the Bosniaks received 48.1% of all votes in Vukosavlje. Yet since then, only minuscule numbers of Bosniaks, out of a total of over 4,000 expelled during the war, have returned to the Vukosavlje municipality villages of Jakes and Modricki Lug, both of which had substantial pre-war Bosniak majorities. The Vukosavlje \"multi-ethnic administration\" is not yielding the results the international community expected in September 1997.\n\nA few rare exceptions do exist. Doboj's moderate Bosniak Assembly Vice-president Reuf Mehmedagic,[76] has achieved notable success in negotiating Bosniak return into the Doboj-Doboj South Zone of Separation with the progressive wing of Doboj's SDS, as well as being the link-man for business deals between Doboj and Tuzla Canton municipalities. Prijedor's Sead Jakupovic and Muharem Muselovic have negotiated housing for 9 KCD BiH councillors in Kozarac (although the councillors have not returned for their own reasons), and spontaneous return of Bosniaks to destroyed villages on the RS side of the Zone of Separation continues.[77]\n\nBut for every rare success story there are many more failures. Parallel institutions exist throughout the two \"mixed\" Federation Cantons, 6 and 7. Throughout the HDZ Croat-controlled Canton 10 southern municipalities of Kupres, Tomislavgrad and Livno, CD Coalition meets with the same \"success\" as in the RS, while the Zavicaj Serb coalition only achieves moderate success, in terms of the return of pre-war Serbs, in the northern Canton 10 municipality of Bosansko Grahovo. Even in Drvar, the municipality in the Federation with the third highest numbers of return of its pre-war residents,[78] the PEC has revoked Final Certification because of \"the municipal authorities' inactivity and failure to fulfil their basic responsibilities.\"[79] The former Serb Mayor of Drvar, Mile Marceta, who lived a two and a half hour drive away in Banja Luka, adopted an obstructive role after the HDZ-sponsored anti-Serb riots of April 1998, demanding a proper investigation into those events in which he was severely beaten by Croats. As a result he was removed from his position by OHR on 16 September, 1999.[80]\n\nNot a single municipality, out of the 136 where elections were held in 1997, has a city council or assembly where a political party representing the votes of an expelled community with a majority of seats, is in a position to exercise real executive power.\n\nG. Boycotts and Threats of Violence\n\nThe boycott, coupled with threats of violence, has been used throughout BiH by minority councillors, who claim it is futile to attend an Assembly where the ruling majority ethnic group ignores all their requests. So too, majority ethnic groups threaten boycotts when it appears things may not go their way. When the OSCE uncovered massive election fraud in HDZ-controlled Zepce, the Croats boycotted the entire election, fearing an honest vote would unseat them. Their boycott of the entire process, as in Srebrenica by the Serbs, has been rewarded by the international community. In both municipalities, those who lost the elections threatened violence and subsequently were granted half of all relevant positions in the local government.\n\nH. The PEC and the Draft Permanent Election Law\n\nAlthough DPA initially envisioned that the PEC would formulate Rules and Regulations only for the 1996 general elections, circumstances have forced an extension. The PEC's mandate now lasts until at least the April 2000 Elections. Although Annex 3, Article V clearly states that the entities would formulate a Permanent Election Law for all future elections beyond 1996,[81] it was only on 5 August, 1999 that the first draft Permanent Election Law was announced.[82]\n\nThe only real significant differences between current PEC Rules and Regulations and the draft Permanent Election Law, are that voters will now choose individual candidates from a party's list of candidates. So too, those candidates elected to the BiH Presidency will now have to collect a certain number of signatures[83] of support from voters living in a different entity, or gain the support of a Municipal Assembly/Council in the other entity.[84] A preferential voting system will be installed for the BiH and RS Presidency races.\n\nReaction to the publication of the draft law has been varied. A number of BiH politicians have commented dryly that if collecting signatures from one's own ethnic group in the other entity is the extent of the attempts to promote multi-ethnicity, then this is not progress. Several prominent opposition figures labelled the new law as \"cosmetic changes.\"[85] A gathering of prominent legal experts at the Sarajevo University's Law Faculty stated that the law is \"in contradiction with the International Pact on Civil and Political Rights, which is an integral part of the BiH Constitution.\"[86] Although the BiH electorate, through the OSCE's Permanent Election Law Public Information Campaign, expressed the desire to be able to vote for individuals rather than simply for parties, the new law emphasises a party list system, which creates a built-in bias in favour of single party voting. This new law appears to represent a move in the wrong direction.\n\nThe central problem with the new draft Election Law is that it is based on the constitutional framework imposed under Annex 4, which forces the people of BiH towards ethnic politics. Overall, the draft Permanent Election Law is not likely to achieve the international community's aims in BiH, as Articles VIII, X, and XI legalise ethnic discrimination. This reflects the legal paradox found in the Dayton Constitution (Annex 4), which adopts international human rights standards, while simultaneously breaking them in its very constitutional structures. As a consequence, the draft Election Law represents an OSCE/OHR compromise with the realpolitik of the SDA, HDZ and Serb nationalist block, something PEC Chairperson Robert Barry himself confirmed in a recent interview to a leading Sarajevo magazine.[87] And unfortunately, this compromise could result in instituting an election law that permits legal discrimination.\n\nI. Whither Elections?\n\nOf the four sets of OSCE-sponsored post-war elections in BiH, the 1996 general elections, the 1997 Municipal Elections, the 1997 special elections to the Republika Srpska National Assembly and the 1998 general elections, only the latter have slightly reduced the power of the ruling nationalist parties. The rest have not even dented it.[88]\n\nNone of the elections has come even close to dislodging the HDZ from absolute control in all Croat-controlled areas.[89] The SDA retains an absolute majority in all Bosniak-controlled areas, with the exception of the Tuzla and Velika Kladusa city councils. In both those areas the Cantons have removed much of the decision-making power from the municipal level and transferred it to the Cantonal level, where the SDA has the required majorities. The HDZ and SDA appear to maintain as strong a position in BiH today as ever, and fulfil a role similar to that of the pre-war Communist Party.[90]\n\nIn Republika Srpska, although the ultra-nationalist SDS/SRS block has lost control of the RS National Assembly and controls few Municipal Assemblies in the western half of the entity, two important points merit mentioning. First, eastern RS (east of Brcko) remains firmly under the control of the SDS/SRS.[91] In this region the prospect of secession remains likely, and has always been the main goal of the SDS and SRS. There is no reason to believe that the Sloga coalition, even should it stay together, will win a significant number of Assemblies in the April 2000 municipal elections. Second, although the Sloga government of Prime Minister Milorad Dodik has been strongly supported by the international community,[92] Sloga maintains a strong nationalist flavour[93] on issues of RS sovereignty, with almost no progress at all on the crucial issue of Bosniak and Croat minority returns to the RS.[94]\n\nRecently the OSCE took action to weaken ultra-nationalist elements in the upcoming April 2000 elections. Reacting to the continued non-compliance of the SRS, the OSCE instructed the party to remove several obstructionist officials from positions of party leadership and resubmit registration documents to the RS courts. Leaders to be removed included former RS president Nikola Poplasen, Mirko Blagojevic, and Ognjen Tadic. Following the SRS' refusal to comply, on 25 October 1999, the OSCE banned the SRS from participating in the April 2000 elections. In addition, the smaller but equally nationalist Serbian Party of RS (SSRS) and its leader Predrag Lazarevic was disqualified from participating in the elections.[95] Although a positive step it does not address the underlying problems of discrimination inherent in the constitution or the PEC rules. And the effect on nationalist extremists -- either positive or negative -- will not be seen until April 2000.\n\nVI. Annex 4: The Constitution\n\nA. The House of Cards\n\nJudging by Annex 4, the DPA's authors intended to create a multi-ethnic country with rule of law, in which a constitution and democratic elections form the basis of legitimate political authority. The highest international instruments of human rights would form the highest laws in the land.[96] Poorly formulated, the DPA Constitution may prevent Bosnia and Herzegovina from meeting Council of Europe standards for admission,[97] and permanently dooms the country to institutionalised ethnic quarrels.\n\nContrary to the Constitution, there exist de facto three - not two - entities. As seen in recent statements by Croatian President Franjo Tudman, the illegal Croat entity \"Herzeg-Bosna\" receives political support directly from one of the Dayton signatories, a direct violation of DPA.[98] Although the joint institutions called for in Annex 4 exist, they do so largely on paper. On the infrequent occasions when central institutions meet, they typically prove unable to come to agreement on the agenda.[99] Although the Parliamentary Assembly has actually met and passed some twenty laws, all were forced on it by the international community. Few of these laws are actually implemented or enforced. The Presidency typically achieves its greatest successes by appearing together for visiting heads of states or international conferences. All in all, the performance and functioning of the central government has been described generously by the June 1999 Peace Implementation Council as \"inadequate.\"[100]\n\nThe only real success under Annex 4 is Article VII, which calls for the creation of a Central Bank, and the imposition of a national currency, the Convertible Mark.\n\nB. Why is it not Implemented?\n\nArticle III:1 of the Constitution specifies the responsibilities of the joint institutions as:\n\n\"Foreign policy...foreign trade policy...customs policy...monetary policy...finances of the institutions...of BiH...immigration (and) refugee...policy, international and inter-entity criminal law enforcement...communications policy,...inter-entity transportation (and) air traffic control.\"[101]\n\nThe remainder of Article III deals with relationships between the entities and the joint institutions, the most important statement being: \"all governmental functions and powers not expressly assigned in this Constitution to the institutions of BiH shall be those of the entities.\"[102]\n\nAnnex 4 goes largely unimplemented for five reasons. First, BiH is only as strong as its joint institutions. Yet the joint institutions deal primarily with BiH's foreign affairs, and have little authority to regulate internal affairs. The Constitution makes the entities de facto mini-states within an imaginary central state. This central state has no army, no police force, does not raise taxes (with the exception of passport fees), does not control its own borders, has a judiciary with extremely limited responsibilities that rarely meets, and a legislature that cannot formulate laws without the entities' approval. In essence, the central state is at best an uneasy confederation with no real power.\n\nSecond, were the joint institutions to actually function, no state-level enforcement mechanism exists to compel the entities to implement state-level decisions. Inside the Federation, what limited influence the joint institutions have derives from the fact that the Presidents of the SDA and HDZ, Alija Izetbegovic and Ante Jelavic, sit on the central Presidency. In RS, Zivko Radisic's influence derives from his position as President of the Socialist Party, and he is at best, the third most important politician in RS, implicit proof that the joint institutions are irrelevant to internal matters of Republika Srpska. Enforcement depends on the good will of the entities.[103]\n\nThird, because the joint institutions depend on the entities for funding, these institutions are only as strong as the entities permit.[104] It is clear that at least one of the entities (RS) and half of the other entity (\"Herzeg-Bosna\") do not wish the joint institutions to function. Republika Srpska is founded on ethnic cleansing and ethnic inequality, while the Federation consists of an uneasy war time military alliance invented by Washington to present a credible military threat against the Serbs. This entity also saw both ethnic groups, especially the Croats, commit appalling acts of ethnic cleansing. Both separatist movements within BiH - the Republika Srpska and the HDZ-controlled Herzegovinian municipalities in the Federation - still receive open support for their separatist policies from the FRY and Croatia, both of whom maintain a hostile, anti-DPA approach to BiH sovereignty. In essence, two of the three ethnic groups work actively against the creation of a unified state.\n\nFourth, the OSCE-approved ethnic gerrymandering during the 1997 municipal elections - which specifically contradicted the text of Annex 3, Article IV - essentially destroyed the functional basis of the DPA Constitution. The municipal election results legitimised via the democratic process the ethnic cleansing that occurred over a gun barrel. Had Annex 3 been implemented as envisioned, it would have resulted in large ethnic minority voter blocks spread throughout both entities, the existence of which would force politicians to compromise. Instead, each ethnic group retreated into its own enclave in pursuit of its own narrow political goals.\n\nFifth, no treaty enforcement mechanism exists, outside of a reluctant SFOR. Due to the IFOR/SFOR refusal to assist in the implementation of DPA's civilian aspects, the central government fails to function, and the OHR is powerless to force the parties to comply.\n\nC. Three Peoples, Two Entities, One Republic\n\nThe DPA was very explicit that the UN-member Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina would continue to exist, but under a new name: Bosnia and Herzegovina.[105] The Serbs rejected the continued existence of Republika BiH for three distinct reasons. First, to accept a continuance of Republika BiH \"with its presently recognised international borders\"[106] would have meant, from the Serb point of view, conceding complete defeat to Sarajevo, as the army and state they had fought against three and a half years was that of Republika BiH.\n\nSecond, all other independent states that have emerged from the former Yugoslavia have established themselves and been recognised internationally as \"republics.\" Namely, the Republic of Slovenia, the Republic of Croatia, the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, and the (Former Yugoslav) Republic of Macedonia. These all sound more firmly established in international constitutional law than \"Bosnia and Herzegovina.\" At the level of popular perception, and as a potential ground for disputing the very statehood of Bosnia and Herzegovina (a major goal of the Serbs), the negotiated dissolution of \"Republika BiH\" at Dayton allowed the Serbs to return to Pale with the clear message that \"victory is ours, the Republic is no more.\"\n\nThird, out of the three \"constituent peoples\"[107] only Serbs were given their own \"republic\" (Republika Srpska), which in traditional Yugoslav political jargon implies statehood.[108] It would of course have been impossible for Republika Srpska to be a composite part of Republika BiH, and so the DPA state had to be called something other than a republic. Furthermore, the idea that a state can be anything other than a Republic is new to former Yugoslav traditions. When the Croat-Bosniak conflict began in 1993, the former Croatian Community of \"Herzeg-Bosna\" became the Croatian Republic of \"Herzeg-Bosna\", when Herzegovinian aspirations to statehood became violently apparent. Even today, the newly-erected signposts in Croatia giving directions to the BiH border crossing at Stara Gradiska/Bosanska Gradiska point the arrows towards \"Republika BiH\", an error which, one can guess, has been made by Croat officials who simply assume that the BiH state is a republic.\n\nThe Bosnia and Herzegovina created at Dayton formulated a concept relatively new to international law, an \"entity\". BiH as a State consists of two entities which have been both given names that are well established categories of international constitutional law: \"republic\" and \"federation.\" Bosnia and Herzegovina is possibly the only state in the world where a Republic (Republika Srpska) is a constituent part of a state that does not call itself or identify itself as a federation of republics, states, territories, cantons, provinces or other such bodies. The irony is that DPA's BiH actually is a very loose federation, and as such should logically be called \"The Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina.\" However, today's Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina is not a state, but an entity, within a BiH state with \"constituent peoples.\"[109] Therefore, the entire question of BiH statehood is thrown into question.\n\nD. Constituent Peoples: Us vs. Them vs. Them\n\nThe Preamble to Annex 4 mentions three constituent nations of Serbs, Croats and Bosniaks.[110] \"Others\" are recognised as an afterthought, with mere \"citizens\" barely worth mentioning.[111] Note that the Serbs, Croats, Bosniaks and Others are not categorised jointly as citizens - the \"citizens\" are an additional, fifth group of people in the state. It is already evident in the Preamble, therefore, that the DPA BiH state was to be hijacked from the citizens and transferred to the three ethnic groups.\n\nBut even this rigorous concept does not apply throughout the country because Bosniaks and Croats are not constituent peoples in Republika Srpska.[112] In a similar fashion, Serbs are denied that status in the Federation.[113] It appears that all three peoples are constituent only at the level of the central state of Bosnia and Herzegovina. Given that the vast majority of state prerogatives, e.g. Military, police and the judiciary are in the hands of the entity governments, the reality is that minorities, be they Serbs in the Federation or Bosniaks and Croats in RS, are legally discriminated against in their dealings with government institutions. This is hardly surprising as they are first and foremost discriminated against in the Constitution.\n\nA further problem of the \"constituent nations\" philosophy enshrined in the BiH constitution is the status afforded to \"Others,\" which is largely ignored. All \"Others\" who do not belong to any of the three constitutionally recognised nations are left in limbo, wondering about their status in this clearly designed \"ethnic\" country. Yet this group of \"Others\" comprised almost 8% of the BiH population in 1991,[114] numbering some 345,786 people, and includes Bosnia's Jewish population. The principle of \"constituent peoples\" is reinforced in many operative paragraphs of the BiH Constitution, where even a formal reference to \"Others\" or \"citizens\" cannot be found. The composition of all common institutions (the Parliamentary Assembly, the Presidency, the Council of Ministers, domestic judges of the Constitutional Court) is based on the \"two entities - three nations\" formula.\n\nThe BiH Presidency provides an example of this philosophy: it is comprised of one Serb, one Croat and one Bosniak.[115] Whether it is presumed that the 8% of BiH citizens from 1991 who had identified themselves as \"Others\" had died, disappeared or suddenly become one of the three main ethnic groups isn't clear. What is clear is that these people are disenfranchised in the vote for the Presidency of BiH. Perhaps a four-person Presidency was deemed unworkable. But for whatever reason, the decision to disenfranchise the \"Others\" was obviously not given much thought, as the 15 delegates to the House of Peoples were to consist of five Serbs, five Croats and five Bosniaks.[116]\n\nE. Denial of Individual Human Rights\n\nWhile it is true that the Constitution lists of all relevant international human rights instruments alongside strong non-discrimination clauses, it is quite certain that, no matter what human rights are proclaimed, they will have to be implemented in an atmosphere of intensive ethnic isolation and mistrust. Members of any of the three distinctive ethnic groups will be protected by the carefully balanced compromise, but only on the basis of their collective (national) identity within the bounds of their separate national enclaves. This leaves no room for those who do not fit into the category of Bosniak, Croat or Serb, or who simply would prefer to exercise their right not to belong to any group.\n\nThe Constitution of BiH does not favour the protection of individuals in their own right.[117] In fact, the concept of individual rights, deeply retarded in any formerly socialist country, has been all but obliterated in Bosnia and Herzegovina. Preoccupation with the rights of ethnic groups reflects the transition from communist to nationalist collectivism, where the despotism of the \"one and only\" ruling party is replaced by the despotism of presupposed ethnic group interests.\n\nThe ethnic determinism and discrimination codified in the BiH Constitution contradicts modern European democratic values of civil liberty and human rights, where sovereignty rests with the citizens of a state, where positions and jobs in all state institutions are open to all, without discrimination on the ground of ethnicity, religion or otherwise. Such discrimination could make it very difficult for Bosnia and Herzegovina to enter into European institutions such as the Council of Europe and eventually the European Union, without first making major revisions in its constitutional order.[118]\n\nF. Dayton's Glue: the Weakness of the Joint Institutions\n\nArticles III, IV and V of the Constitution of BiH introduce the joint institutions, the Parliamentary Assembly and the Presidency of BiH. The other main joint institution, the Council of Ministers, does not merit its own Article in the Constitution, and is instead tucked away in Article V. These Articles demonstrate in detail the level of powerlessness of the joint institutions. So too, they institutionalise the procedures by which various nationalist ethnic leaders can opt out of the state-level law-making process and veto the passing of legislation on the dubious grounds of entity or \"national\" interest. A brief analysis of the responsibilities and performance of the joint institutions demonstrates that as a result of these clauses, neither the Presidency, the Parliamentary Assembly nor the Council of Ministers, represent the real centres of power in BiH. Under the DPA Constitution, the entities have full control over their own armies, police, civil administration and judiciary. They formulate their own laws, the only proviso being that those laws do not contravene the BiH Constitution.\n\nG. The Parliamentary Assembly\n\nIn addition to implementing Presidency decisions, the Parliamentary Assembly is responsible for creating a budget for itself and the other joint institutions, ratifying treaties as recommended by the Presidency, and performing other duties which the entities may give it.[119] Not only does the Parliamentary Assembly not have the authority to enter into governmental matters within the entities, it doesn't even play a serious role in the BiH state structure, other than to regulate its own budget and the budget of the other joint institutions. To date the Assembly's only real function seems to have been enacting whatever legislation is necessary to implement the decisions of the Presidency, essentially as a rubber stamp.\n\nH. The House of [\"Constituent\"] Peoples: Institutionalised Discrimination\n\nThe BiH Parliamentary Assembly is a bicameral Parliament.[120] Under this system, the delegates to the House of Peoples from each constituent nationality are chosen on the basis of a vote by other delegates of the same ethnic group from their entity level legislatures.[121] Under the \"constituent peoples\" arrangement, a leading state institution would include an equal number of the three constituent nations.[122]\n\nIn spite of the apparent symbolism, the upper house, the House of Peoples, contributes nothing to the democratic debate, and institutionalises ethnic discrimination. The real purpose of House of Peoples is to give the three ethnic groups the right to veto legislation on the grounds it is against their \"national interest.\"[123] Two entities send delegates to it, yet the Federation gets twice as many seats as RS. Furthermore, although both entity parliaments contain minorities, the Republika Srpska National Assembly is only allowed to elect Serbs to the BiH House of Peoples, in spite of the fact that only 53% of Republika Srpska's pre-war population was Serb.[124] Serbs from the Federation are not represented.\n\nThe House of Peoples serves a negating function that plays into the hands of those who wish to keep the joint institutions weak. If a majority of any one ethnic group declares any legislation to be against their national interest, then it is not referred back for changes to the BiH House of Representatives, but to the entity parliaments. And in the case of the Bosniaks and Croats, it is referred back to the Federation House of Peoples. The reality is that a mere three deputies of the same ethnic group in the BiH House of Peoples can block any legislation in the BiH Parliamentary Assembly by declaring it against their national interest. That is, of course, if attempts to ground the legislation have not been mounted in the House of Representatives. The Republika Srpska Delegates, in particular, have not been shy to veto proposed legislation in the House of Representatives under the archaic House \"Procedures.\"[125] It is clear that the \"Sloga\" Delegates in the House of Representatives vote together with the ultra-nationalist SDS and SRS as a national block.\n\nI. Legislative Ineffectiveness\n\nSince 1996, the numerous vetoes, squabbles and boycotts in the House of Representatives, have forced the High Representative to impose eight national level laws on an interim basis.[126] Of these laws, only four have since been passed by both the House of Representatives and the House of Peoples.[127] In one instance, the Law on Citizenship - imposed on an interim basis by High Representative Carlos Westendorp - was not ratified by the Parliamentary Assembly until a full 18 months later.[128] To its credit, the Assembly has passed 17 laws that did not need the High Representative's imposition.[129] The very existence of the High Representative's enhanced powers has left the nationalist political leaders in the Parliamentary Assembly in a comfortable position, where they can block legislation for local political purposes, knowing full well it will be implemented anyway.\n\nIn spite of the Parliament's adopting numerous laws, almost all to date have been drafted by OHR/Council of Europe expert working groups. Indeed the only law, which the Bosnians themselves drafted, is the Law on Administrative Taxes, written by the Council of Ministers. Nonetheless, the High Representative was forced to impose it on 31 July, 1999, after the draft failed to make it through the Parliamentary Assembly. Whenever a draft law is put to the Assembly, the various delegates' clubs know that if it is politically unacceptable among hard-line supporters, they can simply wait for the High Representative to impose it. As a result, the Parliamentary Assembly has passed only approximately 25 laws since Dayton, or, on average, 8 laws a year.[130] In practice, it is the opposition parties, such as SDP BiH, that initially propose legislation, and it is the Council of Ministers, in particular co-chairman Haris Silajdzic, that drafts it.\n\nBosnia and Herzegovina's short term goal appears to be Council of Europe Membership. To achieve this goal, the Council of Europe has set forth a number of criteria, which includes reform of old legislation, and implementation of new.[131] Given the current speed and ineffectiveness of the Assembly, OHR insiders estimate Council of Europe membership could be five to eight years away.\n\nFor a country that has aspirations of one day joining the European Union, BiH remains remotely distant in terms of legislative reform and productivity. At the present legislative pace, BiH is decades away from EU membership, as the EU has numerous legal and regulatory requirements covering wide-ranging issues, such as environmental pollution, workers' rights, women's rights, etc., that must be in place before a country may accede. There is no question that the work of the Parliamentary Assembly has been curtailed by administrative and resource problems,[132] which highlights how much the entities disregard the Parliament.[133]\n\nJ. The Presidency\n\nMuch of the prestige, media coverage, protocol and trappings of statehood are attached to the BiH Presidency, and the members of the Presidency are afforded the level of respect due the highest body of government in BiH - the heads of state.\n\nThe Presidency has responsibilities in the fields of BiH foreign policy, such as, appointing Ambassadors,[134] representing BiH in international organisations, and ratifying foreign treaties on behalf of BiH.[135] It is to propose an annual budget for itself and report its expenditures to the Parliamentary Assembly.[136] It has three other vaguely specified functions: to \"co-ordinate as necessary\" with international organisations, perform other duties, which the Assembly or the entities may give it, and executing decisions of the Parliamentary Assembly.[137] Finally, \"each member of Presidency shall, by virtue of the office, have civilian command authority over armed forces.\"[138] Precisely which armed forces is never specified.[139]\n\nThe Presidency has no authority whatsoever to govern within the entities. In fact, many of its specified functions seem to deal with regulating its own bureaucracy. The history of the joint institutions shows that the entities have not given any responsibility to either the Presidency or the Parliamentary Assembly. The reality is that the Presidency is only relevant to BiH politics because of its individual members. Alija Izetbegovic still fulfils a \"Father of the nation\"-type role for BiH Bosniaks, while the Croat member and current Chairperson of the Presidency, Ante Jelavic, meets regularly with OHR and other international officials in his much more powerful role as President of HDZ BiH. The Constitutional confusion regarding whether legislation is to originate with the Presidency or the Parliamentary Assembly, is in practice decided in favour of the Presidency, simply because Izetbegovic and Jelavic are the singularly most powerful members of their respective ethnic groups.[140]\n\nThe actual level of agreement between members of the Presidency may be best seen in two recent examples. First, Alija Izetbegovic's visit to Saudi Arabia and Iran, and second, Zivko Radisic's visit to Belgrade to meet with indicted war criminal Slobodan Milosevic. In the case of Izetbegovic's visit, it was initially billed as a state visit, even though the other members of the Presidency had not been informed of i"
