        "text": "This article is about the lower house of the Parliament of Bosnia and Herzegovina. For the lower house of the Parliament of the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina, a political entity within Bosnia and Herzegovina, see House of Representatives of the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina.\n\nLower house of Bosnia and Herzegovina\n\nThe House of Representatives of Bosnia and Herzegovina (Bosnian: Predstavnički Dom Bosne i Hercegovine, Croatian: Zastupnički Dom Bosne i Hercegovine and Serbian Cyrillic: Представнички Дом Босне и Херцеговине) is one of the two chambers of the Parliamentary Assembly of Bosnia and Herzegovina, with the other being the House of Peoples of Bosnia and Herzegovina. The chamber consists of 42 members which are elected by party-list proportional representation. 28 members are elected from the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina, and 14 from Republika Srpska. Members serve for terms of four years. The current membership of the chamber was elected on 2 October 2022.\n\nElectoral system\n\n[edit]\n\nThe house is elected by party-list proportional representation with open lists. For the first two elections, representatives were elected from nationwide lists, but in 2000, local representation was introduced. Eight constituencies, known as electoral units, each elect between three and six representatives, giving a total of 30. To ensure proportionality, a further 12 representatives are elected on a entity-wide basis. Each entity is allocated a number of these entity-wide seats, 7 members from the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina and 5 from Republika Srpska.[2] When a party is entitled to one of these entity-wide seats, it is given to the candidate from the party who receives the most votes without being elected in his or her electoral unit, located in one of the two entities.\n\nBrčko District voters are entitled to vote in only one of the two entities. Their vote is allocated to the corresponding electoral unit, depending on which entity the voter is voting from.[2]\n\nCurrent composition\n\n[edit]\n\nComposition of the House of Representatives of Bosnia and Herzegovina (as of 3 January 2024)[3] In-House Groups Parties Representatives Party of Democratic Action\n\nStranka demokratske akcije SDA 8 Alliance of Independent Social Democrats\n\nSavez nezavisnih socijaldemokrata SNSD 6 Social Democratic Party\n\nSocijaldemokratska partija Bosne i Hercegovine SDP BiH 5 Croatian Democratic Union\n\nHrvatska demokratska zajednica Bosne i Hercegovine HDZ BiH 4 Democratic Front\n\nDemokratska fronta DF 3 People and Justice\n\nNarod i Pravda NiP 3 Serb Democratic Party\n\nSrpska demokratska stranka SDS 2 Party of Democratic Progress\n\nPartija demokratskog progresa PDP 2 Our Party\n\nNaša stranka NS 2 People's European Union\n\nNarodni evropski savez Bosne i Hercegovine NES 2 For Justice and Order\n\nZa Pravdu i Red ZPR 1 Democratic Union\n\nDemokratski savez DEMOS 1 United Srpska\n\nUjedinjena Srpska US 1 Bosnian-Herzegovinian Initiative\n\nBosanskohercegovačka Inicijativa BHI 1 Forward\n\nNaprijed NPD 1 Total 42\n\nChairmen of the House of Representatives\n\n[edit]\n\nCroatian Democratic Union Serb Democratic Party Party of Democratic Action Social Democratic Party Alliance of Independent Social Democrats Croatian Democratic Union 1990 Party for Bosnia and Herzegovina Union for a Better Future People and Justice\n\n# Name Term of Office Party 1 Ivo Lozančić 3 January 1997 2 September 1997 HDZ BiH 2 Slobodan Bijelić 2 September 1997 2 May 1998 SDS 3 Halid Genjac 2 May 1998 2 August 1999 SDA 4 Mirko Banjac 2 August 1999 2 April 2000 SDS 5 Pero Skopljak 2 April 2000 29 December 2000 HDZ BiH 6 Sead Avdić 29 December 2000 28 August 2001 SDP BiH 7 Željko Mirjanić 28 August 2001 28 April 2002 SNSD 8 Mariofil Ljubić 28 April 2002 9 December 2002 HDZ BiH 9 Šefik Džaferović 9 December 2002 8 August 2003 SDA 10 Nikola Špirić 8 August 2003 8 April 2004 SNSD 11 Martin Raguž 8 April 2004 8 December 2004 HDZ BiH 12 Šefik Džaferović 8 December 2004 8 August 2005 SDA 13 Nikola Špirić 8 August 2005 8 April 2006 SNSD 14 Martin Raguž 8 April 2006 11 January 2007 HDZ 1990 15 Beriz Belkić 11 January 2007 10 September 2007 SBiH 16 Milorad Živković 10 September 2007 10 May 2008 SNSD 17 Niko Lozančić 10 May 2008 10 January 2009 HDZ BiH 18 Beriz Belkić 10 January 2009 10 September 2009 SBiH 19 Milorad Živković 10 September 2009 10 May 2010 SNSD 20 Niko Lozančić 10 May 2010 30 November 2010 HDZ BiH 21 Adnan Bašić 30 November 2010 20 May 2011 SBB BiH 22 Denis Bećirović 20 May 2011 19 January 2012 SDP BiH 23 Milorad Živković 19 January 2012 19 September 2012 SNSD 24 Božo Ljubić 19 September 2012 19 May 2013 HDZ 1990 25 Denis Bećirović 19 May 2013 19 January 2014 SDP BiH 26 Milorad Živković 19 January 2014 19 September 2014 SNSD 27 Božo Ljubić 19 September 2014 9 December 2014 Ind. 28 Šefik Džaferović 9 December 2014 8 August 2015 SDA 29 Borjana Krišto 8 August 2015 8 April 2016 HDZ BiH 30 Mladen Bosić 8 April 2016 8 December 2016 SDS 31 Šefik Džaferović 8 December 2016 8 August 2017 SDA 32 Borjana Krišto 8 August 2017 8 April 2018 HDZ BiH 33 Mladen Bosić 8 April 2018 6 December 2018 SDS 34 Borjana Krišto 6 December 2018 5 August 2019 HDZ BiH 35 Denis Zvizdić 5 August 2019 5 April 2020 SDA 36 Nebojša Radmanović 5 April 2020 5 December 2020 SNSD 37 Borjana Krišto 5 December 2020 5 August 2021 HDZ BiH 38 Denis Zvizdić 5 August 2021 5 April 2022 NiP 39 Nebojša Radmanović 5 April 2022 1 December 2022 SNSD 40 Denis Zvizdić 1 December 2022 1 August 2023 NiP 41 Marinko Čavara 1 August 2023 1 April 2024 HDZ BiH 42 Nebojša Radmanović 1 April 2024 Incumbent SNSD\n\nSee also\n\n[edit]\n\nPolitics of Bosnia and Herzegovina\n\nParliamentary Assembly of Bosnia and Herzegovina\n\nHouse of Peoples of Bosnia and Herzegovina"
