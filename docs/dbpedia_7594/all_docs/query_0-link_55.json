Inpursuanceof theOrderissuedby the Court\n\non 7 October 1993, thatGovernmentfiled on 15April 1994the\n\nMemorialseiting forth the reasonsof law and of fact on which it\n\nseeks to rely in support of its claims.\n\nTheGovernmentoftheFederalRepublicofYugoslavia\n\nraises PreliminaryObjectionsagainst these claims and has the\n\nhonour to set them out and justify them below, in accordance\n\nwith Article 79, paragraph 1 of the Rules of Court, and in\n\npursuance of the Orcierissued by theCourt on 21 March 1995.\n\nAccordingly, this Governrnentwill for the timebeing refrainft-om\n\nfiling, in accordance withArticle 79,paragra3, of the Rulesof\n\nCourt, a Counter-Mernorialin replyto the contentionssetorth in\n\nthe Memorial of the Governmentof theApplicant State. INTRODUCTION\n\n1. The Applicant requests the Court to base its\n\njurisdiction on Article IX of the 1948 Convention on the\n\nPreventionand Punishmentofthe Crimeof Genocide (hereafter:\n\nthe 1948 GenocideConvention).Bearingthis in mind,the FR of\n\nYugoslavia is herebysubmitting its preliminaryobjections. The\n\nApplicant cannot make his retentionof this requestconditional\n\nupon the FR of Yugoslavia's renounciationof its right to raise\n\npreliminary objections. In case theFR of Yugoslavia submits\n\npreliminary objections, the Applicant cannot invoke other\n\npossible grounds for thejurisdiction of the Court and proceed\n\nto submit new reqi~ests,as set out in para. 4.1.0.9. of the\n\nMemorial (p. 132) and para. 4.2.4.5 of the Memorial (p. 178).\n\nThiswould meana revisionof the Mernorialand the formulation\n\nof a new case, which isnot permittedin this procedure. Before\n\ninitiatingtherocedi~reand inthe courseof proceedingsthe FR\n\nof Yugoslaviahad notacceptedthejurisdictionof the Court over\n\nthis Case.\n\n2. The circurnstances which constitute the\n\nbackground ofthe C'asearedominatedby elernents ofcivilstrife\n\nand, consequently, no international dispute is involved over\n\nwhich the Court cari properlyexerciseits cornpetence.\n\n3. By issuing the authorizationfor the institution of\n\nproceedings, Alija Izetbegovichas overstepped his powers as\n\nthe President of 13residencyof the Applicant State and,\n\nconsequently, the A.pplicationis not admissible.\n\n4. The FrRof Yugoslavia holds that the Applicant\n\nState is not a partyto the 1948Gen~cideConventionforit could\n\nnot enter into it by riotificationof succession, for, by declaririgits independence, it violated the duties stemming from the\n\nimperativeruleof internationallaw -the principleof equal rights\n\nand self-determinationof peoples. To prove this violation, we\n\nhaveto highlight the relationsbetweenthe threepeoples in the\n\nterritoryof the former YugoslavRepublicof Bosnia-Herzegovina\n\nat critical junctures, as well as certain segments of their past\n\nhistorywhich havebecome pertinentonceagain in the wake of\n\nthe latest developments.\n\n5. The FR of Yugoslavia points to the fact that the\n\nApplicant State has been recognized as an independent state\n\nincontraventionof internationallaw,thatithasneverestablished\n\nits authority over a larger part of the territory of the former\n\nYugoslav Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina where the\n\nBosnian Serb Republic was formed, as well as that the\n\nestablished authoritystood no chanceof remaining stablefor a\n\nlonger period of time because the new independent\n\ngovernments of Herceg-Bosniaand the Autonomous Province\n\nof Western Bosniawereformed ontheterritory whichhad briefly\n\nbeen under the control of the Governmentin Sarajevo.These\n\nare, also,the reasonswhy the Applicant State is not a party to\n\nthe 1948 Genocide Convention.\n\n6. In view of the fact that armedconflicts are taking\n\nplace in the territory of the former Yugoslav Republic of\n\nBosnia-Herzegovinain whichthe FRof Yugoslaviais nottaking\n\npart, nor did it do so, and consideringthat the FRof Yugoslavia\n\ndid not have any jurisdiction over the contested areas in the\n\nperiod in question,there are no grounds on which to constitute\n\na dispute between the two sides under Article IX of the 1948\n\nGenocide Convention.\n\n7. If, however, the Court establishes that the aboveassertionsare not founded eitheron the lawor on facts or that,\n\neven though they are, there are other reasonswhy this Case\n\nfalls under the jurisdiction of the Court, FRe of Yugoslavia\n\nholds that a jurisdiction of a Court cannot be definedratione\n\ntemporis as claimed bythe Applicantand requeststhe Courtto\n\ndetermine itsjurisdictirationetemporis inaccordancewiththe\n\nlaw.\n\n8. Theopinionsofthe BadinterCommissionto which\n\nthe Applicant has referreddo not constituteresiudicatain this\n\nCase becausethe Badinter Commissionwas not an arbitration\n\nin the sense of internationallaw but an advisory body at the\n\nservice of theChairmanof the Conferenceon Yugoslaviaand\n\ntheopinions bythe Badinter Commission arenotlegallybinding.\n\n9. The participation of the FR of Yugoslavia in this\n\nprocedure cannot be interpreted as its recognition of the\n\nRepublic of Bosnia--Herzegovina. FACTS\n\n1.l. Relevant factsfromthe pastof Bosniaand\n\nHerzegovina\n\n1.1.O.FR:Ydoes not wish to burden this procedure\n\nand this submission with the elaboration of historical facts.\n\nReferencesto certain historicalfacts, however,concerning the\n\napplication of the principle of equal rights and self-\n\ndeterminationof peoplesareindispensableandwillthereforebe\n\nmade here. Of relevance here are the historical facts which\n\ntestify that Serbs have been living in the space of Bosnia and\n\nHerzegovinaas a people for centuries,and that in certain past\n\nperiods they weresi~bjectedto repression,including the acts of\n\ngenocide, at the hands of the Ottomanauthoritiesand later on\n\nof the Muslim-Croatianfascistcoalition during World War Two.\n\n1.1.l. Inmid-10thcentury Bosniawasmentionedforthe\n\nfirst time in Constantine Porphyrogenitus'\"De administrando\n\nimperio\", as an area within Serbia. At the time Bosniawas the\n\nregion around the iupstreamand middle sections of the river\n\nBosna, in effect a geographical designation within the Serbian\n\nstateratherthana separatestateentity.Thesectionsubtitled \"Of\n\nthe Serbs and of the Countrythey nowdwell in\" clearly shows\n\nthat Serbs settled iii Bosnia as early as the ninth century, i.e.\n\nthat Bosniahas beena Serbland. (ConstantinePorphyrogenitus,De\n\nadministrandoimperio,eG.M .oravcsik,trans.R.J.H.Jenkins,Dumbarton\n\nOaks, Washington 1967, 160Annex.p.ll)\n\n1.1.2. In the 12th century Pope UrbanIII regards\n\nSerbia and Bosnia as identical and speaks about the politlcal\n\n1Documents annexedto the PreliminaryObjectionsare marked by \"Annex.p...''\n\n7and ecclesiastical unity of these lands. The Pope likewise\n\ncofirms the rightsof the DubrovnikChurch by the 1187Charter\n\nin which he says: \"regnum Seruilie,quod est Bosna ...-\n\n\"Kingdom of Serbia - that is Bosnia\". (T. Smiciklas, Codex\n\ndiplornaticusregniCroatiae,DalmatiaeetSlavoniae,vol.llZagreb 1904,207)\n\n1.1.3.

Bosnian rulersin the 13thand 14th centuries\n\nexclusively designatedtheir subjects as Serbs and referredto\n\nSerbian as the only language in Bosnia. (S. Cirkovic, I Serbi ne1\n\nMedio Evo, 62., M. Blagojevic, onthe Nationalldentity of the Serbs in the\n\nMiddleAges, Serhsin EuropeanCivilization,Belgrade,1993,25-26,Annex.\n\np.10)\n\n1.1.6, The charters of the Bosnian Governor Matija\n\nNinoslavof 1249 usethe term \"Serb\"to denote an inhabitantof\n\nBosnia and the Charter of Governor Stjepan II Kotromanic\n\naddressedto Dubrovnikregardingthesaleof RatiinSton,dated\n\nMarch 1333, notes that \"two of the charters are Latin and two\n\nare Serb\".

The Charter ofKulin Ban issued to\n\nthe people of Dubrovriik in '189 was aiss written in it. lt was\n\nused lateron too inthe offices of the Bosnian rulersand feudallords as well as in church books. (G. Cremosnik, Die serbische\n\ndiplomatische Minuskel,Studien zur alteren Geschichte Osteuropas II,\n\nGraz-Koln1959, 113-115)\n\n1.1.8. Fromthe beginningofthe 15thcenturyexternal\n\npolitical circumstanc;esbeganto change and Bosniawas being\n\nincreasinglyattacked by Turks.Theirattacksforced King Tvrtko\n\nII to become a vassal both to the Hungarian king and to the\n\nTurkish sultan, to whom he paid regular yearly tributes as of\n\n1415. Bosnia finally fell under Turkish rule in 1463. (C.Jirecek,\n\nGeschichte der Serberi II, Gotha, Friedrich Andreas ParthesA.G., 1918,\n\n168-226.John V.A. Fine, Jr.,The Late MedievalBalkans,Ann Arbor, The\n\nUniversityof Michigan Press,577-590)\n\n1.1.9. The Turks abducted Serb boys, took them to\n\nthe centers of the Ottoman Empirewhere they wereislamized\n\nand trained for soldiers - notorious janissaries. There was\n\nconstant religious iritolerance. As of 1767 the Serbs lost their\n\nautocephalous church and wereofficiallyconsidered \"Romaics\"\n\nand in 1853 a Turkish regulation was enacted banning the use\n\nof the Serbian name. From 1868the rulewas introduced that in\n\nnational terms the entire population had to declare themselves\n\nas being Osmanii. (Milorad Ekmecic, StvaranjeJugoslavije 1790-1918,\n\nII, Beograd, 1989, p.316After the Serb uprising in 1874 which\n\nbroke out as a result of terror, 250,000 Serbs, or one fourth of\n\nthe total population, crossed the Bosnian border into tne\n\nHabsburg-ruled lands. Later on, another 80,000 Serbs fled\n\nBosnia and moved into Serbia and Montenegro (B.H. Summer,\n\nRussiaand the Balkans 1870 -1880,Oxford, 1937).\n\n1.1.18. The first officiai population census in 1879\n\nshowed that the proportion of the Zhreereligiouâ communities\n\nwas: Serbs - 43%, Muslims - 386, Catholics - 18%. (Diurdje\n\nPejanovic, The Popula1:iof Bosnia and Herzegovina, Belgrade,1955;Ferdo Hauptman,The Economy and Society of Bosnia and Herzegovina\n\nduring Austro-HungarianRule(187918), Contributionsfor the Historyof\n\nBosnia and Herzegovina,II, Sarajevo, 1987;Milena Spasovska, Dragica\n\nZivkovic, Milomir Stepic:Ethnic Compositionof the Population of Bosnia\n\nand Herzegovina,Belgrade,1992,68 Annex.15,MarkPinson,The Muslim\n\nof Bosnia-Herzegovina,HarvardUniversity Press, 1994,87,102,103,\n\nAnnex. 21)\n\n1.1.11. The execution by firing squad of 84 Serbian\n\npeasants at the hands of the MuslimvolunteerSchutzkorps in\n\nCelebici on the river Drina at the outset of the World War\n\npresaged the genocide and large-scalemassacresthat wereto\n\nfollow. The violence to which the Serbs in Bosnia and\n\nHerzegovina had been subjected in 191 4 was the reason why\n\nitwasonlytherethatsomepreviousdemocraticinstitutionswere\n\nnot restored.Parliamentsthat hadbeendisbanded in 191 4were\n\nrenewedin al1countriesof Europe.Thiswas not done in Bosnia\n\nand Herzegovinalestthe Serbsdemanded investigationsof the\n\ncrimes committed. Instead, the Governor of Bosnia and\n\nHerzegovina, General Sarkotic, made plans for Bosnia and\n\nHerzegovina to become part of Greater Croatia, for the\n\nestablishmentof an allianceof Croatsand Muslimsinwhich way\n\nthe unificationofYugoslaviaaroundSerbiawould be precluded.\n\n(Stephan F.Sarkotic,Der BanjaLuka Process,1,Berlin, 1933,p.lX) 1.2.

Inview of the principleof self-determinationof\n\npeoples as a basisfor the creationof an independentstate, it is\n\nnecessary to explain the position of Muslims in the territory of\n\nBosnia-Herzegovinafrom theestablishment ofthe Kingdom of\n\nSerbs, Croatsand Slovenesup to 1992.\n\n1.2.1. The national question of Serbs, but also of\n\nother South Slav nations -Croatsand Slovenes -was resolved\n\nwith the creationof theKingdomof Serbs,Croats and Slovenes\n\nin 191 8. This Kingidom was formed when the Kingdom of\n\nMontenegro and thle territories which had belonged to the\n\nAustro-Hungarian Fdionarchybefore World War One and\n\ninhabited by Serbs,{Croatsand Slovenesjoined the Kingdomof\n\nSerbia. The unificationwasachievedon the basis of the right of\n\npeoples to self-determinationwhichwasthen valid as a political\n\nprincipie.(Address by the Diplomatic Legationof the People's Council,\n\nZagreb,1 December1918 andthe Replyof His RoyalHighnessHeirto the\n\nThrone Alexander, December1918, Annex.p. 26)\n\n1.2.2.

Genocidecommittedagainst theSerbs in Bosnia\n\nand Herzegovina duringthe SecondWorldWar\n\n1.3.1. Withthe Nazioccupationof Yugoslavia earlyin\n\nApril 1941 Bosniaand Herzegovina wereincorporatedby force\n\ninto the lndependentStateof Croatia, a satellite stateled by the\n\nCroatian fascists - the Ustashi, whose head was Dr. Ante\n\nPavelic. A massivecampaignof conversionto Catholicismand\n\nof genocide was mounted in that state. Certain Catholic\n\nclergymen directly workedon this up to 1943whenthe Vatican\n\ndistanced itself from the Croatian ustashi movement. In the\n\norganized genocide against Serbs,Jews and Gypsies,several\n\nhundred thousand people were killed. (Ladislaus Hory, Martin\n\nBroszat,DerKroatische Ustascha-Staat 1-1945,Stutgart,1964;Odone\n\nTalpo, Dalmazia. UnaCronacaper lastoria 1941,Roma,1985, 998.Official\n\nedition of the ltalianGeneral Staff,Edmond Paris,Convertor Die, Catholic\n\nPersecutionin Yugoslaviauring World War II,printed in the USA,Annex.\n\n51, Avro Manhattan, The Vatican Holocaust, printed in the USA, 1986,Annex. p. 58)\n\n1.3.2.By the decision of Nazi Germany and fascist\n\nltaly at the Vienna Conferenceof April 21 and 22, 1941, Bosnia\n\nand Herzegovina was made part of the lndependent State of\n\nCroatia. By special provisions the Government of the\n\nlndependent State of Croatia designated its commissioners to\n\nquickly institute Ustashi authorities and be in charge of direct\n\npreparations for theterror againstthe Serbs, Jewsand Gypsies\n\nin Bosnia and Herzegovinawhich was to ensue.\n\n1.3.3. Arriong the most notorious of the Ustashi\n\ncommissionersdesignated for Bosniaand HerzegovinawereDr.\n\nViktor Gutic (for the Banja Luka region), Nikola Jurisic (for\n\nTravnik), Prof.HakijciHadzic (forthe Tuzla basin), Don Bozidar\n\nBralo (for Sarajevo),Dr. DragutinKamber (for Doboj), Dr. Pavle\n\nCanki (for Mostar) and prof. Alija Suljak (for eastern\n\nHerzegovina). Jure Francetis was appointed Chief Ustashi\n\nCommissioner for the entire Bcsnia and Herzegovina.\n\nDuring World War ilthe Nazi Gerrriânyorganizad a\n\nMoslem SS division - \"Hanjar\"\n\n1.3.4.Theestablishmentof UstashiaiathorityinBosnia\n\nand Herzegovina met with the overt support of Moslem\n\npoliticians from the Yugoslav MoslemOrganization (hereafter:\n\nJMO), the pro-Ustashi Moslem intelligentsia as weii as of\n\ndifferent population strata. Thus Osman Kulencsvic was\n\nVice-Premier of the Ustashi governrnent unti! November 1941\n\nwhen he was replaced by Disinfiuenrial brother Jafer. Aincng\n\nthe Ustashi were the leaders af JMC Harnid Kurbegovic,\n\nIsmet-begKapetanovicand otl-ielc;.Moslems grnineritUslashi\n\ndignitaries were the! depaty f:eac%of s'raieAdei:-raga ?desic,\n\nMehmed Alajbegovic;(laterforeign ministerof tka lndependznt\n\nState of Croatia), HâikijaHadzic, AtijaSuijag arid a!fie;i~theGovernment of the lndependent State of Croatia (theCroatian\n\nParliament) there were as many as11 representatives of the\n\nJMO at the beginning of 1942.\n\n1.3.5.TheUstashiauthoritiesnominatedthe Moslems\n\nHamdija Beslagic and Ragib Capljic heads of the counties of\n\nPlivaand Ramaand Usoraand Soli.They al1exerted efforts for\n\nMoslems to declare themselves as Croats and support the\n\nestablishment and strengtheningof Ustashirule in Bosnia and\n\nHerzeg0vin.a.\n\n1.3.6. Ustashipropaganda portrayedthe Moslemsas\n\none of the main constituentsin the forming of the lndependent\n\nState of Croatia and proclaimsthem the \"flower of Croatdom\",\n\nand Bosniaand Herzegovina \"theheartand sou1of Croatia\".At\n\nthe same time, the Serbs are represented asthe centuries-old\n\nenemy which has to be liquidated. All this prompted many\n\nMoslems fo join the Ustashi movement, either through their\n\nparticipation instashiand Home Guardsmenquisling armed\n\nformations or by joining the state bodies and organizations of\n\nthe lndependent State of Croatia.\n\n1.3.7. lntensified propaganda was employed\n\nthroughout the war, especially byreligiousfactors (Moslemand\n\nCatholic) to incite to crimes against the Serbian people in\n\nBosniaand Herzegovina with aviewto carryingout the general\n\nstrategy of the lndependent State of Croatia for soiving the\n\nSerbian question: kill a third, expel athird and convert a third to\n\nCatholicism.Bytheir crueltyand massivescale,crimesin Bosnia\n\nand Herzegovina did not differ from those in Croatia itself,\n\nespecially in primitive religiouslyfanatic Moslemcommunities.\n\nThus for example crimes in Herzegovina, where the Chief\n\nustashi Commissionerwas the Moslem AlijaSuljag, started as\n\nearly as on June 1, 1941 and soon reached unheard-ofproportions. In what are known as the three waves of carnage\n\nof the Orthodox population (inJune, on the holiday of St.Vitusl\n\nday (Vidovdan)and on the holidayof St. Elias'sday (Ilinden)in\n\n1941, almost 12.000 men, women and children of Serb\n\nnationality were killed and thrown into pits. In the pit near the\n\nvillage of Korito near Gacko alone, 160 Serbs were killed and\n\ntheir property appropriated by Moslems.\n\n1.3.8. At the same time, in several villages near\n\nLjubinje,the Ustashikilled 143 peasantsandthrewthem in a pit\n\nin the village of Kapavica, and somewhat later, on June 23,\n\n1941, in the fields of Popovo Polje they captured and killed\n\nanother 168 personsof Serb nationalityand threw them in the\n\npit \"Rzanido\". On 6 August 1941the Ustashithrew about five\n\nhundred women, c:hildrenand old men who were mostly alive\n\nin the pit \"Golubinkia\"in Surmanci.Horrendous massacresand\n\ncarnage rapidly spread through Herzegovina. Of 1020 Serb\n\ninhabitants of the village Prebilovci near Capljina, 824 were\n\nsubjected to the crime of genocide by the Ustashi.

At the same\n\ntime, 450Serbsfrom Mostar wereslaughtered,battered to death\n\nwith clubs or thrown into the Neretva river. The mass scale of\n\nthese murders is gruesomely attested to by the \"request of the\n\nCroatian population\" from the Neretva river valley to the highest\n\nauthorities of the lndependent Stateof Croatia,\"notto throw the\n\ncorpses of killed Serbs into the Neretva and other rivers of\n\nHerzegovina because they pollute the water\".\n\n1.3.10.The most massivecarnages in the territory of\n\nBosniatook place during August 1941 in its western regions. It\n\nis estimated that at the end of June over 20,000 Serbs, among\n\nwhom a large number of children, were killed in the districts of\n\nBihac, Bosanska Krupa and Cazin alone. About 6,000 people\n\nwere killed in the area of Sanski Most and another 6,000 in the\n\narea of the districts of Prijedor and Bosanski Novi. Only in\n\nBosanska Krupa, on July 31, 1941 , the Ustashi killed several\n\nhundred Serbs (men,wornenand children) and the day after, in\n\nthe general \"cleansing\"of that district,a further 1,000persons of\n\nSerb nationality.\n\n1.3.11. The daily reports of the Gendarmerie show\n\nthat in the area of the commune of Buzin \"between 1,000 and\n\n1,300 Serbs were killed\" in just one day (August 1 , 1941), 500\n\nSerbs in the surroundings of Kljuc, while the day after, 800\n\nhostages were killed in Sanski Most, and nearly 3,000 men,\n\nwomen and children of Serb nationality in the territory of the\n\nentire district.\n\n1.3.12. MoslernUstashitook the lead in most of these\n\ncampaigns. The Office for Public Order and Security of the\n\nlndependent Stateof Croatia (NDH)was informed on August 22,\n\n1941, that \"an Ustashi iinit composed of 200 Bosnians -\n\nMoslems attacked the Serb village of Kotorane in the district ofDvor na Uni\"and that theattackers setfireto houses,plundered\n\nthe village and slaughtered a large number of its inhabitants.\n\n1.3.13.Ori thefirstdayof September 1941,thevillage\n\nof Srdjevici was raided by a group of Moslemsfrom the nearby\n\nvillages of Basici, Kula, Muhovici and from Gacko who, led by\n\nMusa Basicand Avdo Zvizdic,setfire to the housesand looted\n\nSerb property.\n\n1.3.14. The extermination of the Serbs and the\n\nultimatesolutionto the Serbianquestionwerenot muchdifferent\n\nin other parts of Bosnia and Herzegovina either. The\n\nCommanderof theV'ojnaKrajina(Military Frontier)Command,in\n\nhis report of September 20, 1941,commentson the situation in\n\nthe areaof Jajce anclits surroundingsafterthe arrivof Moslem\n\nUstashifrom Herzegovina and notes that \"total anarchy reigns\n\nin Jajce, 117 Ustashiiwho fled Mostarand Herzegovinabefore\n\nthe ltalian army, mostly Moslemsfrom Gacko and Mostar, are\n\ncommitting grave atrocities in Jajce and the vicinity: four days\n\nago 158 Greek Orthodox Serbs were slai~ghterecf in the\n\nOrthodox Church in Jajce\".\n\n1.3.15. Iri numerous actions of this kind, Moslern\n\nUstashi took the lead in killing the Serbian population and\n\nlooting their property. The Serbs, in smalier or iarger groups,\n\ntook refuge in the mountains and fled from one territory to\n\nanother before such terror. \"ln the periûd from August 1-5,\n\nbetween 4,600 and 5,000 Orthodoxes fled to the area of the\n\ngendarmerie precinct Zirovac in thedistrict of Cazin, fram the\n\narea of the gendarmerieprecinctsVrgorac and Ravnice,fleeing\n\nuntold terror at the hiandsof the Moslems\",saysthe daily report\n\nof August 15, 1941.\n\n1.3.6.

They gouged out\n\ntheirvictims' eyes, cut off their tongues and ears, slit open the\n\nbellies of women extracting unborn infants, smashed in their\n\nskulls...\n\nItis a state of fact that in1941 the regular armed\n\nforces of the lndependentStateof Croatia, the Ustashi, offered\n\nas a birthday presentto their leaderAnte Pavelica basketfull of\n\neyes they had gouged out of dead Serbs.

At the same time, the German commander of\n\nSarajevo qualified such crimes as \"violenceof the worst kind\",\n\nquoting examples of mass murder and massacreof Serbs.\n\n1.3.19.

Inparallelwith massliquidationand terror the\n\nauthorities of the lndependent State of Croatiasystematically\n\nmoved Serbsoutto Serbiaor forciblyconvertedthemto Roman\n\nCatholicism. According to German data, in 1941 alone some\n\n180,000 Serbs were moved out to Serbia from Croatia and\n\nBosnia-Herzegovina and during the four years ofWorld War II\n\n(1941 -1945),some 400,000Serbsfrom Bosnia werebanished\n\nt0 Serbia.

Duringthe war, special larger Ustashiarmed\n\nformations were forrned of Moslems,such as for instance, the\n\n13th SS Moslem Division and 369th Legionary Division. The\n\nHanjar Division, set up in May 1943 by Hitler's Germany and\n\nmade up of Moslems (60%) and of Germans, mostly\n\nVolksdeutschers, (4.0%)was the most notorious of them all.\n\nThese units killed 352 Serbs at Sremska Raca alone in July\n\n1944.

The status of Muslimsin Bosnia-Herzegovinain\n\npost-war socialistYugoslavia\n\n1.4.1. In post-war socialist Yugoslavia, the status of\n\nMuslims improved from that of a religious minority to that of a\n\npeople. Art. 1 of the 1974 Constitutionof the Socialist Republic\n\nof Bosnia-Herzegovina says:\n\n\"The Socialist Republic of Bosnia-Herzegovina is a\n\nsocialist democratic state and a socialist self-managed\n\ndemocratic community of the working people and citizens, the\n\npeoples of Bosnia and Herzegovina - Muslims, Serbs and\n\nCroats, persons belonging to other peoples and nationalities\n\nliving in it, based on the rule and self-management of the\n\nworking class and al1working people and on the sovereignty\n\nand equal rights of the peoples of Bosniaand Herzegovina and\n\nof persons of other peoples and nationalities living in it.\n\n\"TheSocialist Republicof Bosniaand Herzegovinais\n\na part of the Socialist Federal Republic ofYugoslavia.\"(Annex ..\n\n104)\n\nThis is probably a unique case in the history of the\n\nworld that a religious minority has advanced to the status of anation.\n\n1.4.2.

It lhaditsassembly as the constitutional and\n\nlegislativebody, itsgovernmentasthe executive,presidency as\n\na representative boldy and a constitutional court and its awr?Supreme Court.\n\n1.4.5.In post-war Yugoslavia, the Muslims were\n\nproportionally represented in al1agencies of government, both\n\nat local, republican and federallevels. The following perçons\n\nheld high-ranking offices in the Federation:Avdo Humo (1953,\n\n1962), Hasan Brkic (1958), Osman Karabegovic (1949,1953-57,\n\n1963), Dr Zaim Sarac (1953-57), Safet Filipovic (1945 - 1960),\n\nLutvo Ahmetovic (1965),Ahmet Cahovic (1965-1967), Dr Kemal\n\nKapetanovic (1969), lbrahim Maglajic (1965), lbrahim Liftic\n\n(1969), Mustafa Sabic (1962), Dzemal Bijedic (Prime Minister),\n\nMuhamedHadzic, HakijaPozderac(1969), FehimHalilovic (until\n\n1980), Dr Kemal Tarabar, Mumamed Berberovic (1985), Nijaz\n\nDizdarevic (1982), Dr Muhamed Kesetovic, Tarik Karavdic\n\n(1978), Kadir Alijagic, lzet Brkic, Smajo Mandzuka, Hamdija\n\nPozderac, Raif Dizdarevic, Dzevad Mujazinovic (1989), Suada\n\nMuminagic (1990),lbrahimHadzic(1990),lrfanAjanovic, Ibrahim\n\nTabakovic (198&) ,emalHalilovic(1984),SabrijaPojskic (1990).\n\n1.4.6 F.rom 1945to 1992,the Muslims in Yugoslavia\n\nmade remarkable progress and developed freely in economic,\n\npolitical, cultural and religious fields.\n\n1.4.7. lslamic clergy was educated at the Gaza\n\nHusref-Beg Madrasah in Sarajevo.A number of young Muslims\n\nattended religious schools in lslamic countries. Unfortunately,\n\nthey were one of the conduits through which the ideas of\n\nmilitant Islam were irriported into Yugoslavia.\n\n1.4.8. There were four universities in Bosnia and\n\nHerzegovina: in Sara!evo (since 1949), in Banja Luka (since\n\n1975), in Tuzla (976) and in Mostar (1977). 1.4.9. The Academy of Sciences and Arts of Bosnia\n\nand Herzegovinawas founded in 1966.\n\n1.4.10. Inthepost-warperiod,the economyof Bosnia\n\nand Herzegovinadevelopedrapidly.Alargenumberof industrial\n\nfacilities were constructed in Bosnia and Herzegovina withthe\n\nFederal Governmentfunds.\n\n1.4.11. All arts were developed in Bosnia and\n\nHerzegovina. There were theateres in Sarajevo, Mostar, Banja\n\nLuka, Zenica and other. The associationsof authors, painters,\n\nmusicians and others were established. Movie industry was\n\nflourished as well.\n\n1.4.12. All three peoples participated equally in al1\n\nspheres of social life. Hence, the Muslimsin Yugoslavia fully\n\nenjoyed their rights as a people on the principle of equality and\n\nself-determination.\n\n1.5.

The crisis was\n\nprovoked by the separatist forces within the League of\n\nCommunists of Croatia.\n\n1.5.2. Farmersin Serb villages set up vigils, ari-lied\n\nthemselves illegally and took other self-defensivemeasures. 1.5.3. A certain number of Serbs left Croatia and\n\nBosnia and Herzegovinafor Serbia.\n\n1.5.4. The crisis ended when Josip Brpoz Tito\n\nreplacedthe Croatianpolitical leadership.\n\n1.6. The foundingof parties in theYugoslavRepublicof\n\nBosnla and Herzegovina in 1990\n\n1.6.1. The Parliament of the Socialist Republic of\n\nBosnia-Herzegovinaadopted a Law on Civic Associations in\n\nBosnia- Herzegovina in the first half of February 1990 (Officiai\n\nGazetteof the Socialist Republicof Bosnia-Herzegovina, No.nnex.\n\np. 109).This created a legal basis for the formation of political\n\nparties. The three most important of the many parties formed\n\nhad an explicitly nationalcharacter.Theywerethe MuslimParty\n\nof Democratic Action, the Serbian DemocraticParty and the\n\nCroatian Democratic Union (hereafter:HDZ).\n\n1.6.2. The Muslim Party of Democratic Action\n\n(hereafter:SDA)was formed on 26 May 1990in Sarajevo. Alija\n\nlzetbegovic was elected as its leader.\n\n1.6.3.Giventhe earlierbiographyand activitiesof Mr\n\nIzetbegovic,hisappearanceonthe Bosnia-Herzegovina political\n\nscene provoked the concern and mistrustof the Serb people in\n\nBosnia-Herzegovina.Mr. lzetbegovic was sentenced twice on\n\nthe grounds of subversive activity from thepositions of lslamic\n\nfundamentalism.\n\n1.6.4.Alijalzetbegovicwrotethe\"lslamicDeclaration\",\n\na religious politicalogram,in 1970,and itwas illegallyprinted\n\nand distributed among Muslims.Itwas publishedagain in 1990in Sarajevo. It was suùtitled \"A program of the lslamization of\n\nMoslems and Moçlen~Peoples\". Alija's aimwasthe lslamization\n\nof Muslims and his imottowas \"faith and struggle\", This was\n\nconcisely and explicj!:explained underneaththe subtitle. Since\n\nthe whole text of the \"lslamic Declaration\" is appendecf to the\n\nPreliminaryObjections (Annex.p. VI), weshall mention hereonly\n\nthose parts that wis think are the most important for an\n\nunderstanding of Alija Izetbegovic's political activity.\n\n1.6.5. One of the mosi: important of the ideas\n\npresented by A. lzetbegovic in the \"lslamic Declaration\" is the\n\nunity of religion and politics. Startingfrom this idea, lzetbegovic\n\narrives at his \"first and most important conclusion\", which was\n\ncertainly a reason for serious concern among Serbs in\n\nBosnia-Herzegovina. Lateron in the \"lslamic Declaration\", in the\n\nthird paragraph under the heading \"Islamis nof only a religion\",\n\nstands the text:\n\n\"The firscindthe mostimportantof these conclusions\n\nis definitely the on52about the incompatibility of Istan~and\n\nnon-islamic systerns.There ean be no pêace or coexistence\n\nbetween the 'Ialânnic faith' and 'non-Jsiarnic'soclail and\n\npoliticalinstitutions.

A. lzetbegovic does not only advocate the\n\nlslamization of one Muslimcommunity, but a global lslamization\n\nof al1Moslems. Inthe fourth thesis on the lslamic order, entitled\n\n\"The unity of Moslems\", he says:\n\n\"Islam comprises the principle of ummet, Le., the\n\naspiration for the unification of al1 Moslems into a single\n\ncommunity - religious, cultural and political. lslam is not a\n\nnationality, but it isthesupranationalityofthis community.\" (Bold\n\ntype is ours)\n\n1.6.7. This is what A. lzetbegovic says about the\n\nintroduction of lslamic rule:\n\n\"Emphasizingas a priority religious and moral revival\n\ndoes not imply - nor can it be interpretedto imply - that lslamic\n\norder can be achieved without lslamic rule. This stand only\n\nmeans that Ourroad does not proceed from the conquering of\n\npower, but rather from the conquering of people, and that\n\nlslamic revival is primarily a revolution in the field of education\n\nand only after that in the field of politics.\n\n\"Therefore, we must be preachers first and then\n\nsoldiers. Our prime means are personal example, books and\n\nwords. When wili force be added to these means?\n\n\"Thechoice of the right moment is always a specific\n\nquestion and depends on a number of factors. Nevertheless,\n\nthere is a general rule: lslarnic order should and can approach\n\nthe overtaking of rule as soon as it is morally and numerically\n\nstrong enough not onlyto overthrowthe non-lslamic rule but\n\nto develop new Islamic rule. This differentiation is important,\n\nsince destruction and development do not require an equal level\n\nof psychological and material readiness. '70 act prematurelyis equallyas dangerous as to be\n\nlate in taking the required action.\n\n\"The conquering of power on the basis of a\n\nfavourable concurrence of events,without sufficient moraland\n\npsychological preparednessand withoutthe required minimum\n\nof competent and developed personnel implies the realization\n\nof another coup anclnot an lslamic revoiution (and a coup is a\n\ncontinuation of non-llslamicolitics by othergroups of people or\n\non behalf of other principles). To be late in the overtaking of\n\npower means to deny oneself a very powerful means for\n\nachieving the aims of lslamicorder and to give non-lslamic rule\n\nan opportunity to strike a blow to the movementand disperse\n\nits activities. For the latter case, recent history gives sufficient\n\ntragic and illustrativeexamples.\"(Boldtype is ours)\n\n1.6.8. In an attempt to hide his true intentions, as\n\noutlined in the above text of the \"lslamic Declaration\",and after\n\nforming an anti-Serb coalition betweenthe SDA and the HDZ\n\nwith the aim of preserving a single and unitary Bosnia-\n\nHerzegovina, lzetbegovic began to speak about\n\nBosnia-Herzegovina. as a civil, multi-ethnicstate. However,the\n\nSerb people did not believe in such a sudden change in Mr\n\nIzetbegovic's politicialconvictions.\n\n1.6.9. Howjustified this lack of confidence was can\n\nbest be seenfrom the factthat Alijalzetbegovicdid not manage\n\nto hide for long behind this transparent political mask, and the\n\nlslamization of the Muslim population on territory under his\n\ncontrol became quite ciear i1994. This isshown by a series of\n\nreports from territoiry under his control. A campaign began\n\nagainst mixed marriages, anti-warsongs of Serb singers were\n\nbanned, and even \"loyal\"Christianswerediscriminated agairist.\n\nThe Mujaheddinconitributedto this by banningthe consumptionof alcohol, and aemanding women to Wear long hooded\n\noverdresses.

One of the ways of expressing lslamic\n\nfundamentalism of the leadership of the Party of Democratic\n\nAction (SDA) was their readiness to sacrifice their citizens in\n\norder to achieve foreign political goals: condemnation of Serbs\n\nand foreign military intervention. There are convincing\n\nindications that the Moslemauthoritiesactivatedthe mine in the\n\nline of people waiting for bread on 27 May 1992 in Sarajevo,\n\nwhen 17 people were killed and a large number wounded. n/\n\nnetworks broadcast the terrifying pictures al1around the world\n\nand military forces of the Republic of Srpska were condemned\n\nwithout any proof.

A forward\n\nsupport and coordination center was established in the fall of\n\n1991 in Bulgaria. In early 1992, forces of the Armed Islamic\n\nMovement (AIM)assumed an offensiveand special operations\n\nthroughout Bosnia-Herzegovina. Most active are the Islarnic\n\nJihad forces, the elite component of the Movement's\n\n'internationallegion', led 'Afgans'.Tehrânurgedand actively\n\nsupported the establishment of 'volunteer forces from ail ovei\n\nthe Muslim world who would rushto help their brothers in iaith\n\nin the Balkans'.\n\n\"inBosnia-Herzegovina,the AIM forcesareorganized,\n\nvery disciplined, cind well equipped, Their commander is\n\nMahmud Abdul-Aziz, a veteran of sex yecirs of fighting in\n\nAfghanistan under Ahmed Shah Massud and other combat foi\n\n'the sacred cause' in the Philippines and Kashmir, who clso\n\nparticipateci in clandestins operati~t~sin Africa for Turabi.\n\n\"The 'Muslim Forces' include severai hundiedvolunteers, primarily from Iran, Algeria, Egypt, Sudan, Persian\n\nGulf Arab states, Pakistan,Afghanistan, Syria, and Turkey..As\n\nof the fall of 1992, there were 200-300volunteer mujahideen in\n\nthe Travnik area; 200 in the center of Bosnia;an undertermined\n\nnumber (in the hundreds) in Sarajevo and in eastern Bosnia-\n\nHerzegovina. Theyfight the Serbs and train the Bosnianforces.\n\nThey also teach children the Koran and fundamentalist lslamic\n\nways. The volunteers also train local Muslims in special\n\noperations. Meanwhile,theflowof volunteers,including Muslims\n\nfrom the United Kingdom, some of whom are 'Afghan' veterans,\n\ncontinues. By early 1993, there were over 1,000 mujahideen\n\nfrom Pakistan, Iran,Sudan and Libya.\n\n\"ln addition, Iran maintains a core of highly\n\nprofessional operatives, mainly lranians from the Pasdaran and\n\nLebanese from the HizbAllah, who provide expert training and\n\nassistance and conduct the most sensitive covert operations\n\n(intelligence and terrorism). Tehran continues to provide\n\nSarajevo with weapons and experts. In early November 1992,\n\nmore than 50 expert terrorists and instructors of the HizbAllah\n\nand the Tawhid (its Sunni counterpart under Sheikh Sha'ban)\n\nwere sent from Baalbak to Bosnia-Herzegovina to train local\n\ncadres and launch operations on their own. These trainers\n\nspearhead on ongoing lranian efforts to deploy a 2.000-strong\n\nbrigade of its Al-Quds Forces. All these forces receive\n\nsubstantial lranian military assistance.\n\n\"lndeed, since the summer of 1992,there has been a\n\nmarked escalation in provocations by the Muslim forces, the\n\ngoal of which is to secure military intervention by the West\n\nagainst the Serbs (and, to a lesser extent,the Croats). Initially,\n\nthese provocations were mainiy senseless attacks on their own\n\nMuslim population. The UN concluded that a special group of\n\nBosnian Muslim Forces,manyof whom had served with lsiamistterroristorganizations, committedaseriesofatrocities,including\n\n'some of the worst irecentkillings', against Muslim civilians in\n\nSarajevo 'as s propaganda ploy to win world premeditated\n\nattacks and atrocitiescommitted against Serbiancivilianstrying\n\nto flee contested aireas.

In the very first public appearances of the\n\nleaders of the new parties different views on the political\n\norganization of the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia\n\n(hereafter: SFRY) and the Socialist Republic of Bosnia-\n\nHerzegovina were expressed. During preparations for the\n\nfoundation of the SDS, its future leaders stressed as the\n\nessence of its program two aims: that al1parts of the Serb\n\npeople living in the SFRYshould remain in Yugoslavia, and the\n\nmaintenance and development of friendly relations with\n\nneighbouring peoples, in the first place the Muslims.

'The Serb National Council in Bosnia-\n\nHerzegovina was formed at the pan-Serb rally in Banja Luka on\n\n12 October 1990. It was said at a press conference that the\n\nSerbs had been forced to organize in this way because at the\n\nend of the 20th century they had been deprived of the state they\n\nhad created. By that time, the Serbs had been eliminated from\n\nthe Croatian Constitution, which had earlier recognized thern as\n\na constituent people in Croatia.

A resolution of Muslim intellectuals on a\n\nsovereign Bosnia-Herzegovina was presented at a press\n\nconference held in Sarajevo on 7 January 1991, on Orthodox\n\nChristmas. (M. Duric, Objavljena rezolucija muslimanskihintelektualaca\n\n/Resolution of Muslim IntellectualsMade Public/ Politika,8 January 1991,\n\nAnnex. p. 416i7) It was probably no coincidence that this\n\nstatement was made precisely on the Orthodox Christmas Day.\n\nIt is mentioned because certain acts of genocide against the\n\nSerbs were committed on Orthodox Christian holidays during\n\nWorld War II. Thesame happened in the civil war that started in\n\n1992. The holding of the press conference at which the\n\nresolution of the Muslim intellectuals was presented on the\n\nChristian Orthodox Christmas Day was prsbably part of a\n\ndeliberate strategÿ aimed at further irritating the Serb people.\n\n(See paragrapn 1.3,7.)\n\n1.8.2.The details of this strategy were presented by\n\nSDA leader A. lzetbegovic at a press conference held in\n\nSarajevo on 30 January 1991, wheri he said: \"If Slovenia and\n\nCroatia secede from the present Federation, Iwill consider that\n\nI no longer have any authority toconduct further talks on a new\n\nYugoslavia. I willpropose that a referendurn be held of al1\n\ncitizens of Bosnia-Herzegovina -not of individual peoples - todecide on the independence and sovereignty of\n\nBosnia-Herzegovina and that a decision be reached by a\n\nmajority of at leasttwo-thirds.\" A Declarationon the Sovereignty\n\nof Bosnia-Herzegovinawas given to reporters on this occasion.\n\n(Referendum O samostalnostiBiHIReferendumon the lndenpence of 6-Hl\n\nPolitika, 31 January 19, nnex. p. 41819)\n\n1.8.3 .nFebruary 1991, the SDA Executive Council\n\nprepared a Draf?
