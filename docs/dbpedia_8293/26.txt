I'm assuming that ocsmgrd receives the "done" message from a client that has finished cloning and displays the "finished cloning" on the server. Is there any way to have ocsmgrd do something else, like run a script, when the clients finish cloning?

By default, no. Of course you can modify /opt/drbl/sbin/ocsmgrd to make that. It's written in perl so it should be very straightforward if you are familiar with perl.
