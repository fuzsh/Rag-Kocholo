Very very useful. Thanks a lot

ok

hello all i download clonezilla but i didn't Rufus to create the bootable device what to do ?

the most vailuable app for backup. Great tool. Thumbs Up. Thanks for the development team from Taiwan.

I have been using Clonezilla since its first release in 2007 or so. It has been upgraded as new hardware and software emerged over time. Clonezilla has never let me down! What is being done on this product is true to the 'open source' tradition, and that is remarkable. Kudos could never be enough to thank Steven for his contribution to those that need a simple, reliable and thoroughly tested suite to provide something as basic, and needed, as 'backups'. I tried to make a donation to this project, but was denied, with a notice stating that "Donations aren't supported in this organization's country". I can however state that this project has allowed me to keep abreast of my favorite Linux Distro, for over 15 years. It made other complicated sets of options pale in comparison to this Simple, Effective and Reliable program. My experience with this program is that it has been 'rock solid' and 'without errors'. Thank you for your vast contribution to my hobby for all this time ... Robert
