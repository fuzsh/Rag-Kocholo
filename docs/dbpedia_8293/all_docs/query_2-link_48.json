        "text": "EasyDCIM v1.9.3 ensures even more extra time at your disposal!\n\nStarting now, you can happily bid farewell to devoting more and more of your precious time in order to take care of monotonous tasks which lead to another deadline missed. Thanks to the release of EasyDCIM v1.9.3, you’ll be able to complete actions that used to take you hours in a matter of seconds using the new tool for bulk editing. Let’s find out precisely what we managed to come up with this time! Bulk editing no longer just a wish! Let’s face the truth: on more than one occasion you wanted to make some changes to all of your 8 servers or edit just one detail, but in 10 CPUs. We bet that the first thought that crossed your mind was \"Oh, how I wish I could just modify items in bulk and not each one individually!\" You don’t have to wish anymore, as it’s at this very moment that we present a brand new feature that will get rid of the repetitiveness: \"Mass Edit\" option! Similarly to what the \"Mass Add\" tool of the 1.8.3 release is capable of, you’ll be able to quickly edit as many devices or items of the same type as you need! This new option can be accessed from multiple tables such as \"Search Inventory\", \"Servers\" or \"Network\", providing you with a really quick access to bulk editing. Would you like to take a look at all changes you performed? Simply view the Mass Edit Summary and you’ll have them all on display! User traffic consumption outlined \"Total Traffic\" is a spanking new option of the 1.9.3 release that will shed light on the bandwidth consumption of all given user’s devices. This tool will enable you to view information in graphs on: Devices, putting in the picture the traffic of those assigned to a given customer, Servers, giving insight into the traffic of all of client’s assigned servers, Orders, summarizing the traffic of all colocations and servers ordered by the customer. It’s never been that effortless to lay hands on all crucial bits of information you were looking for! What's new with EasyDCIM extensions? The 1.9.9 update of OS Installation supports SystemRescueCd 9.0.4, a new installation template for managing or repairing your system and data. This popular toolkit isn’t the only addition of the latest upgrade – Detect Hardware is a new version of a template that, as the name perfectly sums up, is responsible for detecting the hardware installed on a dedicated server. Last but not least, we are proud to unveil PDU Management 1.2.3, where the new type of graphs gather details about power consumed by single outlets on specific APC and Raritan devices. It’s our top priority to ensure that you can fully benefit from the full potential of everything you have just read about, and for this very reason we want to remind you once again of the crucial migration to Debian 11. You are welcome to use our detailed instructions, or even leave it completely to our team – how does that sound? We in no way want to take away the pleasure of discovering each detail the new EasyDCIM v1.9.3 has to offer, so let us cordially invite you to explore it yourself! View the Changelog!\n\nRelease Notes\n\nEasyDCIM v1.9.2 – Quick Configuration Wizard kicks DCIM into high gear!\n\nYou may have thought that in order to start experiencing the full potential of our ultramodern and feature-rich control panel for bare metal server provisioning, you would have to spare a lot of your precious time to go through an arduous process of configuration. This, however, could not be any further from the truth with Quick Configuration Wizard, which crowns the list of innovations delivered in the brand-new release of EasyDCIM 1.9.2! Easy, for a reason! Quick Configuration Wizard is meant to be initiated right after the installation with the purpose of taking you through the basics in just six simple steps. Each of the following actions is designed to take as much weight off your shoulders as possible, empowering you to kick off your EasyDCIM journey quicker and with less effort than ever! 1. General Configuration Providing the company name, email address and password of the administrator. 2. Location Defining the first location and subnet configuration for the DHCP server. 3. Remote Agent Installing a remote agent in a location different than this of the main EasyDCIM server. 4. Switch Configuration Detecting the first switch via SNMP protocol during the Auto-Discovering process. 5. Server Configuration Adding the first server with network configuration and IPMI access data. 6. Finishing Up And finally, validating the completed steps. After rapid set up by means of the Quick Configuration Wizard, you will be granted the possibility to instantly try out the essential features of EasyDCIM, such as installing operating systems, rebooting the server remotely, or gathering data via polling!

Just one click at the \"Show Next Steps\" button placed conveniently on your Dashboard, and you know exactly what else to pay attention to! The more, the merrier Stretching the choice of supported system templates with each new version of EasyDCIM is slowly becoming our trademark. The 1.9.2 update could not be any different! The OS Installation extension returns in the 1.9.8 version, ready to deal with the installation of Rocky Linux 9 and Ubuntu 22.04 LTS in a fully automated manner! And to leave zero room for wondering: all crucial processes, from the time zone and language configuration to the execution of first-boot scripts, are handled flawlessly via EasyDCIM, just as in all previously delivered additions. With such a wide variety of templates at hand, do you already know which one you’ll go for? New drivers on radar IPMI Integration For EasyDCIM will bring you even more levels of automation, with the updated 1.4.4 version, which introduces new drivers for the JAVA KVM console: the first dedicated to Huawei iBMC 5, and the second to Inspur devices! Migration already ticked off? We wouldn’t be asking whether you've migrated to Debian 11 yet if our top priority wasn’t making sure you can fully benefit from Quick Configuration Wizard as well as the remaining features of EasyDCIM v1.9.2. After all, only with \"bullseye\" installed can you gain access to all kinds of advantages this and future updates have to offer! Worry not, as you won’t get left confused not knowing how to go through this process – we offer step-by-step guidelines, as well as a completely free possibility of our team upgrading your current EasyDCIM server for you! With excitement at its peak, fueled by an overwhelming sense of adventure, make your next stop at our website and see the full changelog of EasyDCIM v1.9.2, for a brief, straight to the point description of the spanking-new Quick Configuration Wizard and the summary of other no less impactful changes. View the Changelog!\n\nRelease Notes\n\nProgressing support for operating systems and colocation in EasyDCIM v1.9.1!\n\nIt may seem that the turmoil of emotions has long since faded away and the dust has already blanketed the grief after the controversial demise of CentOS, but as soon as you step a little further behind the front door of most industry forums, you will quickly find out that the struggle to hook up with a worthy replacement is still very much real. So how could we not back you up on this battlefield by going the extra mile to keep EasyDCIM's support for the top alternative operating systems in peak condition? It is in precisely this way that our platform reached the release of version 1.9.1, further accompanied by the evolution of colocation support. A real treat for CentOS ex-users When one of the best-loved and most popular free Linux systems is forced out of nowhere to pack its bags, and vanishes into thin air, replaced by pretty much a totally different architecture, one can easily imagine most of the community entering the state of utter confusion progressing to borderline panic. Expecting crowds of disoriented users rushing to google all possible alternatives to CentOS, we quickly put on our superhero capes and equipped EasyDCIM with new templates meant to allow the automatic installation of operating systems thought of as most likely to fill in the vacant spot. Remember how quickly our poll revealed everyone's favorite? But implementing these templates is one thing. Keeping them closely fitted into the post-CentOS landscape is a whole other story, which today unfolds right before your eyes with the release of EasyDCIM v1.9.1. The OS Installation extension received a solid dose of code refreshments to deal with the 9th generation of AlmaLinux and CentOS Stream in the smoothest manner possible. Moreover, the spectrum of OS templates has been stretched to new levels after developing support for Fedora 36 Server. All three successfully handle the most needed processes which are: Time zone and language configuration Disk partitioning Creation of user accounts and root password Configuration of network interfaces Installation of additional system packages as well as post-installation and first-boot scripts If we were to run another round of this poll today, would your vote be the same as it was back then, or would it be different? Colocation hits the sweet spot Citing the report drawn up by Grand View Research, \"The global data center colocation market size was valued at USD 44.42 billion in 2020 and is expected to grow at a Compound Annual Growth Rate (CAGR) of 13.3% from 2021 to 2028 to reach USD 117.82 billion by 2028\". Quite an impressive trend, don’t you think? Like many of its kind, this one has emerged mainly due to COVID-19. When the pandemic swept the world, it changed the rules of the game once and for all, pushing thousands of companies outside the comfort zone in order to stay afloat in this competitive marketplace. With more and more employees working from home, and the explosion of our virtual interactions, the colocation route makes now more sense business-wise than ever. Expanding the colocation-related capabilities of EasyDCIM, therefore, felt like the only right direction for the platform to grow in. Consequently, in version 1.9.1, all data center owners are assisted by new actions when handling colocation orders: Enable/disable traffic aggregation ports Delete RRD files with graphs and traffic data Remove the activity log entries Unassign network ports/colocation devices But introducing these options didn’t seem functionally enough to call it a day. That’s why we took it even a tad further and enhanced the EasyDCIM’s client area with a list of network ports assigned to each colocation (with instant access to numbers behind data consumption), as well as a brand-new section specifically for adding and removing rDNS records within the colocation. Looking at how well the colocation data center market is doing today, would it actually be too bold of a move to jump on the bandwagon, and see for yourself where it gets you? Still to make friends with Debian 11? We know there’s a lot on your plate already, but as someone who cares about you a lot, we feel compelled to make sure that migrating to Debian 11 hasn't slipped too far down your to-do list. We wouldn't be making such a big deal out of it if it weren't for the fact that without \"bullseye\" installed, you won't be able to benefit from EasyDCIM v1.9.0, nor from any future updates! Don’t forget we offer comprehensive assistance with this process, and by comprehensive we mean step-by-step instructions as well as the possibility of our team upgrading your current EasyDCIM server totally free of any charge! However much we have already revealed, don't let your curiosity be fully satisfied just yet. Spare another minute or two to scan the changelog of EasyDCIM v1.9.1 some further as it guarantees you a detailed insight into new criteria-based order matching as well as multiple other enhancements that belong to the realm of modern data center management. View the Changelog!\n\nRelease Notes\n\nEasyDCIM v1.9.0 celebrates Debian 11 “bullseye” support!\n\nConsidered \"so good, there's simply no reason to not use it\", Debian 11, with quite a suggestive nickname \"bullseye\", has become our next prime target as soon as it popped up on our radar back in 2021. It immediately seemed clear to us that turning integration with this particular Debian distribution into an official feature of EasyDCIM would be... a bullseye (pardon the pun). But what precisely does the transition from Debian 9 mean for EasyDCIM, and how does it justify calling the platform's 1.9.0 version a game-changer on so many functional levels? We're about to find out! The mother of all Ubuntu-based distributions Among all Linux distributions you could possibly think of, Debian, with almost three decades of growth, is continuously being ranked as the most stable and versatile one. Its leading position on the global stage can best be illustrated by the fact that other no less known distributions such as Ubuntu, Linux Mint, Elementary OS, etc. can find their roots in Debian. Did you know? Each Debian release gets a codename from a Toy Story character. In like manner, it is Woody's wild west horse from Toy Story 2 that has officially become the face of Debian 11. Eleven is your new lucky number Debian 11 premiered officially on August 14th, 2021 and, just like all previous releases, is going to be actively maintained for the next 5 years. And to give you a scale of how fruitful two years, one month and nine days of development can be - \"bullseye\" contains over 11,294 new packages out of an impressive number of 59,551 ready-to-use packages overall in Debian's repositories. As you can easily guess, it's quite impossible to do Debian 11 justice in just a few words, but we'll happily use this limited space to discuss the most impactful changes (as if we haven't already done so dozens of times in the office), which we believe are: Linux kernel 5.10 series with support for the exFAT (Extended File Allocation Table) filesystem used by default to mount exFAT filesystems. Several desktop environments, such as: Gnome 3.38, KDE Plasma 5.20, LXDE 11, LXQt 0.16, MATE 1.24, and Xfce 4.16. A huge variety of updated software packages, including: Apache, BIND DNS Server, Emacs, GIMP, LibreOffice, MariaDB, OpenSSH, Perl, PHP, PostgreSQL, Python, Rust, Samba, and Vim. The powerful combination of EasyDCIM v1.9.0 and Debian 11 will not fail to produce a vast range of benefits, with higher security and faster performance being those particularly welcome. A word of caution: Debian 9 \"stretch\" goes End of Life (EOL) on June 30th, 2022, and as such, will not receive any security updates after this date. In consequence, Debian 11 will from now on be the only supported system on which EasyDCIM can be installed. Our documentation has been updated with detailed guidelines that will walk you through migrating from Debian 9 according to the method you find suitable. EasyDCIM has got your back! Secondly, to ensure that you are never left without access to effective protection in the event of e.g. system failure, OS Installation extension returns in the 1.9.6 version with an updated equipment meant to help you with various admin tasks: Clonezilla 2.8.1-12 Memtest86+ 5.31b GParted 1.3.1 Hiren's BootCD PE 1.0.2 A new face of power outlet management Another bold feature of EasyDCIM v1.9.0 puts the spotlight on the range of PDU drivers which has been momentously expanded to cover a new driver supporting Dell rPDUs devices. The list of available actions handled by PDU Management v1.2.2 extension include, inter alia, automatic device detection with easy viewing of key parameters as well as power usage monitoring simplified with a graph. While we focused on highlighting Debian 11 support along with a few other newcomers in EasyDCIM v1.9.0 that we're personally most thrilled about, the changelog will, as always, detail every single kind of modernization that the platform has gone through. If you are eager to figure out which one is your own favorite, there's only one quick step left for you to take: View the Full Changelog!\n\nRelease Notes\n\nShift into high gear with EasyDCIM v1.8.3!\n\nAs a data center owner, spare time isn’t likely something you have at hand in overly large amounts. There are quite a few things we imagine that you have a lot of though... like tasks to accomplish, and deadlines to meet. So how not to break down under the strain of overwork and carry through the business chores in a shorter time? With EasyDCIM v1.8.3 of course! Leap into (bulk) action! We would not do justice to the mightily time-saving nature of this just finished 1.8.3 release without turning the spotlight on a brand-new feature empowering you to add devices or items in bulk. The \"Mass Add\" tool has been introduced to free you from the repetitive, mundane task of manually creating inventory items one by one... We're getting a headache just thinking about it. Fortunately, those rough times are over, as now you can easily - and above all quickly - add as many devices or items of the same type as you only need. If you take a good look around this new set of equipment, you certainly won’t fail to spot an additional option for managing the bulk import from a CSV file. The possibility to import data about all your devices and items at once will come in particularly useful for new EasyDCIM users during the early phase of migration from other systems. And to make this entire process as comfortable as it is express, the form of the table with inventory elements mirrors that of the world-popular Google Sheets (with all proportions intact). Next chapter of visual makeover What only adds to the modern look and feel of EasyDCIM, manifested specifically in the visually pleasing 1.8.0 edition, is a new driver based on \"Chart.js\" that has been implemented to handle interactive graphs in the backend. Naturally, previous graph types are still supported, so you can freely specify in the global system settings which one exactly you would like to apply. Apart from an even more tasteful model of data visualization, the update is also responsible for enriching the repertoire of available graphs with as many as 13 new ones, presenting such important insights as: Aggregate Traffic Average Packet Size Load Network Traffic Percent Utilization Ping Power Usage Remote Agent Status Remote Poller Performance Status Traffic Unicast Packets User Aggregate Traffic Greater controllability at hand Is he using his port too much again? No worries, you no longer have to stand idly by. Because next time one of your customers starts generating a high traffic on their Arista VEOS device, you can simply change the allowed speed of their port to a lower one. All credit goes to Switch Management For EasyDCIM v1.4.1. Working hard will only get you far but working smart will propel your business to heights you have never even dreamed of. The changelog will take it from here to bring you up to speed on other newly established powers within EasyDCIM v1.8.3. Enjoy! View the Full Changelog!\n\nRelease Notes\n\nHone your VLAN handling skills with EasyDCIM v1.8.2!\n\nFor a rapidly growing control panel that deals with countless types of data center operations on a daily basis, keeping up with the times seems to be the only right New Year’s resolution. And even though we are still a few days away from officially stepping into 2022 with this very goal close at heart, we are closing the EasyDCIM’s busiest year of development yet with a true cherry on top - a spanking-new 1.8.2 release which apart from following the current trends and customer expectations, progresses in leaps and bounds into the future, especially in the field of effective control over switch devices. VLAN management got smarter… again! Juniper was today joined by the switches based on the HPE Comware Software and Arista VEOS systems in the group of officially supported devices. Just like the previous addition, this pair of newly implemented drivers is responsible for allowing you to manage VLANs as well as toggle the network ports on and off without the need to use any other protocols. Switch Management For EasyDCIM, with its latest 1.4.0 edition, is an extension where all the key actions on VLANs happen, including that of: VLAN addition, VLAN assignment to the network port (either singly or in bulk), automatic detection during the device’s polling process. Let all those craving an even more sophisticated understanding of the subject feel cordially invited to explore our documentation loaded with various business-critical insights. Zero in on furthered Proxmox VE support Another major step up for the automatic OS installation has been scored by adding the leading-edge generation 7.1 of Proxmox Virtual Environment to the rich portfolio of system templates - all for your clients to acquire instant access to a number of functional capabilities of this ultra-modern platform for virtual machines and containers management. But that’s not the only reason why we are bringing OS Installation For EasyDCIM right before your eyes today – let’s not forget that Debian 11 \"bullseye\" system template also forms a central part of the extension’s fine-tuned 1.9.5 update. Feeling tempted to delve much deeper into this brand-new spot on the EasyDCIM’s growth map, and learn how to work the above described along with multiple other supplies of freshly unlocked powers straight into your data center business? View the Full Changelog!\n\nRelease Notes\n\nKeep up with the many faces of growth in EasyDCIM v1.8.1!\n\nNow that the quality graphics of \"Locations\" and \"Floors & Racks\" sections have smoothly blended into your everyday workflows, making your admin experience as aesthetically pleasing as it is technologically advanced, the timing is perfect to unlock more doors to EasyDCIM's functional growth. Though the expanded PDU management capacities alone can elevate it to the must-have status, this article highlights a few more reasons why the all-new EasyDCIM v1.8.1 deserves every ounce of attention it can get. Raritan takes the stage What many shall view as the centerpiece of this stand-out release - and quite rightly so - is PDU Management For EasyDCIM v1.2.1 which has had its collection of PDU drivers enlarged with support for Raritan devices - more specifically, for their PX2 and PX3 series. Something to think about: Raritan’s intelligent solutions have been chosen by more than 60,000 data centers around the globe - including 9 of the top 10 Fortune 500 technology companies. Among the key features that we developed with Raritan’s PX PDUs in mind you will find, for example, detecting devices along with their key parameters via the Auto-Discovering process, controlling the status of power outlets as well as collecting real-time data on power usage in graph form. Two more reasons to appreciate JAVA KVM IPMI Integration For EasyDCIM is back in a vastly updated 1.4.2 version featuring a couple of new drivers for the JAVA KVM console: one dedicated to HP iLO 5 and the other to Lenovo ThinkSystem (TSM) devices. Whether either of these two is a likely choice for your business, we’ll leave it for you to decide, and instead focus just on reminding how important, yet often unseen role the KVM console plays these days. Working as an application in your browser, the console’s job is to imitate a real-time keyboard, video, and mouse (KVM) interaction with your servers from any remote location. To put it more visually, if that helps your understanding: imagine as if you were sitting directly in front of your server - this is precisely how easy it is to operate your devices with the use of a KVM console. Another attractive OS alternative at hand The guide to our favorite additions of EasyDCIM v1.8.1 could not possibly be complete without mentioning the growing catalog of OS templates. Included in OS Installation For EasyDCIM v1.9.4, the latest template is responsible for the automatic installation of Windows Server 2022, the system which continues to be quite a hot-button issue in the eyes of the IT community. Interestingly, Windows Server 2022 did not become known for an outstanding set of features in the first place, but rather for its pretty unusual - to say the least - way of announcing its own general availability, far less festive than the one which made Bill Gates dance 26 years ago. However, it would be grossly unfair not to give Microsoft credit for a number of new solutions contained in Windows Server 2022 that rank it as the most sophisticated version to date. The most noticeable enhancements include: ✓ Secured-core server - Apply an active multi-layered protection against advanced attacks. ✓ Azure hybrid capabilities - Connect with Azure Arc to take advantage of assorted cloud services with on-premises Windows Server 2022. ✓ Flexible application platform - Benefit from 40% smaller Windows Containers images, better application compatibility and simplified Windows Container experience with Kubernetes. Help is on the way! A different yet just as valuable feature that was made available upon the update of OS Installation extension is a new SystemRescueCd 8.0.4 rescue template full of tools that will come in particularly useful when the need to restore the server configuration arises. Essentially, it secures an easy way to carry out many key actions on your computer such as creating or editing the hard disk partitions. We hope this article, though brief, shows clearly how many more doors EasyDCIM v1.8.1 has opened when it comes to efficient and trouble-free data center management. Make your next stop at our website as the full changelog of this release promises you an even wider variety of the newest developments to delve into. View the Changelog!\n\nRelease Notes\n\nFeast your eyes on EasyDCIM v1.8.0 with two totally new sections!\n\nWhile growing the variety of EasyDCIM tools with ever more advanced solutions is an explicit goal, it is of equal weight for us to keep its equipment invariably easy in navigation and intuitive in regular use. But what exactly does it take for a control panel to be user-friendly? On August 25th, EasyDCIM makes a successful comeback in a 1.8.0 version, ready to bring some next-level thinking to the table, together with its newly minted \"Locations\" and \"Floors & Racks\" sections. Let’s unfold the map! As the user experience officially becomes a ranking factor in Google search results, it no longer comes as a shock that the times of text-heavy content are over (good riddance!), replaced by a way more digestible model of data visualizations. It was therefore only to be expected that we tap into this indisputable trend sooner rather than later. And voilà! The grand debut of two new sections of EasyDCIM is a tribute to an effortless, and visually aesthetic management of locations, floors and racks. Everything from generating a building view to placing racks in a grid of selected sizes is now based on easily navigable graphic representations. Hand in hand with the world map showing the exact location of each server, switch or PDU device, the \"Locations\" section invites you to scan statistics on either all or single locations in the system as well as traffic and power usage presented in graph form. The \"Floors & Racks\" section features the building’s 2D view where you can create a grid for each floor and locate rack cabinets in any preferred position with no more than just a few clicks. This one is also equipped with a handy set of graphs and figures to let you quickly drill down into specific pockets of information on floors and racks.

See Kurtzer himself praising the project on LinkedIn: 2. Oracle Linux 8 - aspiring to the title of the fastest-growing Linux distribution on the market, Oracle Linux is a freely distributed open source OS that is fully compatible - both source and binary - with RHEL, and suited to enterprise-class workloads. If you are eager to learn some salient facts about other operating systems hailed as the most functionally capable to fill the void left by CentOS, this article is your next go-to guide. More functional powers on tap Just in case you are wondering, that is still not all EasyDCIM v1.8.0 has up its sleeve. Go ahead and dig around for more updates packed into the following extensions: IPMI Integration For EasyDCIM v1.4.1 PDU Management For EasyDCIM v1.2.0 EasyDCIM v1.8.0 with its brand-new layer of graphics is much more than just pleasing to the eye. It improves scannability and reduces mouse clicks by providing a high-level snapshot of the absolute essentials - locations, floors and racks, with at-a-glance views of how much data transfer is used.
