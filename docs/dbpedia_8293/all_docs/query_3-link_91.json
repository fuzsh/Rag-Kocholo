It works ok but people ask me to modify it from time to time… I never programmed in PERL.\n\nI’m not actually looking for help as this is a “one day per year” thing they can deal. And I’m not looking to replace it… though I could.\n\nJust wondering if the world at large even remembers it. Or if there are still people out there who work with it.\n\n(the software is from '91 and we started using it in…2008? maybe? So dated stuff)\n\nI user it from time to time, I had a script that did some regex stuff to text and formatted it as html using other odd markup for colors. Though we had someone that knew more PHP than me integrate that stuff into the the normal page I think. Been a while since I looked at the site really."
