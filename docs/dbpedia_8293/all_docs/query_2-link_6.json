Two types of Clonezilla are available, Clonezilla live and Clonezilla SE (Server Edition).\n\nFeatures\n\nFilesystem supported: ext2, ext3, ext4, reiserfs, xfs, jfs of GNU/Linux, FAT, NTFS of MS Windows, HFS+ of Mac OS, UFS of BSD, minix of Minix and VMFS of VMWare ESX. Therefore you can clone GNU/Linux, MS windows and Intel-based Mac OS, no matter it's 32-bit (x86) or 64-bit (x86-64) OS. For these file systems, only used blocks in partition are saved and restored. For unsupported file system, sector-to-sector copy is done by dd in Clonezilla\n\nLVM2 (LVM version 1 is not) under GNU/Linux is supported.\n\nMulticast is supported in Clonezilla SE, which is suitable for massive clone.\n\nBased on partclone to clone partition. However, clonezilla, containing some other programs, can save and restore not only partitions, but also a whole disk.\n\nSee All Activity >\n\nLicense\n\nGNU General Public License version 2.0 (GPLv2)\n\nFollow Clonezilla\n\nClonezilla Web Site\n\nYou Might Also Like\n\nQrvey allows SaaS companies to create richer products and bring them to market faster\n\nOur pre-built javascript widgets make it a snap to embed charts, reports and dashboards right into your app\n\nQrvey is a low code embedded analytics platform built to help SaaS providers by simplifying the process of putting analytics tools in the hands of all users as fast as possible.\n\nRate This Project\n\nLogin To Rate This Project\n\nUser Ratings\n\n4.7 out of 5 stars\n\n★★★★★\n\n★★★★\n\n★★★\n\n★★\n\n★\n\n107\n\n8\n\n2\n\n3\n\n5\n\nease 1 of 5 2 of 5 3 of 5 4 of 5 5 of 5 4 / 5\n\nfeatures 1 of 5 2 of 5 3 of 5 4 of 5 5 of 5 4 / 5\n\ndesign 1 of 5 2 of 5 3 of 5 4 of 5 5 of 5 4 / 5\n\nsupport 1 of 5 2 of 5 3 of 5 4 of 5 5 of 5 4 / 5\n\nUser Reviews\n\nVery very useful. Thanks a lot\n\nok\n\nhello all i download clonezilla but i didn't Rufus to create the bootable device what to do ?\n\nthe most vailuable app for backup. Great tool. Thumbs Up. Thanks for the development team from Taiwan.\n\nI have been using Clonezilla since its first release in 2007 or so. It has been upgraded as new hardware and software emerged over time. Clonezilla has never let me down! What is being done on this product is true to the 'open source' tradition, and that is remarkable. Kudos could never be enough to thank Steven for his contribution to those that need a simple, reliable and thoroughly tested suite to provide something as basic, and needed, as 'backups'. I tried to make a donation to this project, but was denied, with a notice stating that \"Donations aren't supported in this organization's country\". I can however state that this project has allowed me to keep abreast of my favorite Linux Distro, for over 15 years. It made other complicated sets of options pale in comparison to this Simple, Effective and Reliable program. My experience with this program is that it has been 'rock solid' and 'without errors'. Thank you for your vast contribution to my hobby for all this time ...
