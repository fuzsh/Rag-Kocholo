This document provides an overview of several open source backup software options. It describes BackupPC, a network backup server that can backup Linux, Windows, and Mac computers to a server's local disk. BackupPC uses rsync, SSH, Samba or NFS to backup data incrementally and store identical files only once to minimize storage usage. It has a web-based interface for configuration and monitoring backups. The document also lists other open source data backup, cloning, disaster recovery, and network mirroring software solutions and outlines different backup scenarios for data, operating systems, restores, and disaster recovery.",
