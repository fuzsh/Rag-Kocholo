        "text": "This release of Clonezilla live (2.6.3-7) includes major enhancements and bug fixes.\n\nENHANCEMENTS and CHANGES from 2.6.2-15\n\n• The underlying GNU/Linux operating system was upgraded. This release is based on the Debian Sid repository (as of 2019/Sep/03).\n\n• Linux kernel was updated to 5.2.9-2.\n\n• Partclone was updated to 0.3.13+git0819-2f1830e-drbl1.\n\n• Remove zfs-fuse since it's too old. The support for zfs mounting using openzfs can be found in Ubuntu-based Clonezilla live >= 20190903 releases.\n\n• Package partclone-utils was updated with new upstream on Aug/29/2019: https://github.com/prekageo/partclone-utils\n\n• Modify parameters about BT in drbl-ocs.conf: Use gen-torrent-from-ptcl (ezio-ptcl) to create torrent file from torrent.info, not using transmission-create anymore. This could save a lot of time when the source image is big.\n\n• Remove \"-t 3 -k 60\" from ezio_seeder_opt, i.e., keep ezio seeder in the server all the time until it's killed by ocs-live-feed-img stop.\n\n• Add a new sample program custom-ocs-3.\n\nBUG FIXES\n\n• Package live-tools was updated to 20190627. The issue about poweroff/reboot should have been fixed: failed to execute shutdown binary freezing execution.\n\n• Add thin-provisioning-tools in drbl/clonezilla live packages list, and device-mapper-persistent-data in the PKG_TO_QUERY of drbl.conf. Thanks to Tseng Wynn (wynn1212 at gmail com) for reporting this bug.\n\n• Fix a typo in zh_TW.UTF-8. Thanks to Chih-Hsuan Yen: https://gitlab.com/stevenshiau/drbl/merge_requests/12\n\n• Avoid torrent.info created by Partclone being included in the torrent file. This should solve the issue: https://sourceforge.net/p/clonezilla/discussion/Clonezilla_server_edition/thread/15c3efbffa and https://sourceforge.net/p/clonezilla/discussion/Clonezilla_live/thread/aba35adf97\n\n• Separate 32-bit and 64-bit syslinux when running makeboot.sh. Thanks to Martin Mokrejs for reporting this issue. Ref: https://sourceforge.net/p/clonezilla/bugs/326/\n\n• Update the mechanism to generate new machine-id for restored GNU/Linux. Thanks to Peter Sun for reporting the issue and providing the solution.\n\n• Add option -iui for ocs-onthefly, and implement the ocs-update-initrd for restored GNU/Linux.\n\n• Bug fixed: the source IP address for disk to remote disk was not shown in the source (server) side when there is one NIC configured.\n\nThis release of Clonezilla live (2.5.6-21) includes major enhancements and bug fixes.\n\nENHANCEMENTS and CHANGES\n\n* The underlying GNU/Linux operating system was upgraded. This release is based on the Debian Sid repository (as of 2018/Aug/12).\n\n* Linux kernel was updated to 4.17.8-1.\n\n* Language file ca_ES was updated. Thanks to René Mérou.\n\n* Add Polish language files. Thanks to kris .\n\n* Live-boot was updated to 1:20180603-drbl1 which applied patches from https://sourceforge.net/p/clonezilla/bugs/298/. The carrier of NIC will be detected before going on. Thanks to Michal Zatloukal.\n\n* Package name btrfs-tools was replaced by btrfs-progs in Debian and Ubuntu.\n\n* Add package ipmitool in Clonezilla live.\n\n* Add ocs-iso-2-onie which can be used to turn Clonezilla iso to ONIE image. It's based on the what Luca Boccassi has patched to Debian live. Ref: https://salsa.debian.org/live-team/live-build/merge_requests/4... read more"
