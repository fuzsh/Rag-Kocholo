It's not in the Debian repo anymore.\n\nRemoved thin-provisioning-tools from packages list of clonezilla live due to it breaks the dependence.\n\nAdded package yq, and removed package deborphan in live system.\n\nMerged pull request #31 from iamzhaohongxin/patch-1. Update zh_CN.UTF-8.\n\nLanguage file ca_ES was updated. Thanks to René Mérou.\n\nLanguage file de_DE was updated. Thanks to Savi G and Michael Vinzenz.\n\nPackage live-boot was updated to 1:20240525.drbl1.\n\nPackage live-config was updated to 11.0.5+drbl3.\n\nSet a bigger scrollback for screen in live system.
