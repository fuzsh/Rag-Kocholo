It is released under the GNU General Public License (GPL).\n\nWhy one more Linux live CD? you might ask\n\nWell, I started this project because I wanted to have a rescue CD that would be as self-contained as possible, using my favorite tools. My goals are to have:\n\nA backup/restore system\n\nI have chosen Clonezilla Live for this, as it is flexible enough to fulfill my needs. Furthermore, it makes it possible to create automated restore CDs/DVDs. This way, restoring a system will be fast and easy enough for anyone to perform (even people with minimum technical knowledge).\n\nA rescue system\n\nI have chosen SystemRescueCD for this, as it is generally highly appreciated.\n\nSystemRescueCD is a live CD with a GUI, based on gentoo, which provides tools like GParted, the graphical partition tool, GNU-Parted, an excellent text based partitioning tool, TestDisk, a data recovery tool, Clam-AntiVirus, a free Anti-Virus sofware, Partimage, Python, Perl, file system, networking and archiving tools, editors etc.\n\nBoth of them in just one disk\n\nThe only way to do this was to create a Multi Boot CD.\n\nEnhanced features [^]\n\nEnhancements to Clonezilla Live\n\nAutomated restore DVDs can be easily created, so that anybody can perform a system restore operation (even people with minimum technical knowledge). All the necessary files for the creation of the DVD are included in Clonezilla-SysRescCD.\n\nA set of shell scripts make it easier to restore an image file to a location (disk or partition) different than the one originally backed up.\n\nOther enhancements\n\nPart of Clonezilla-SysRescCD's web site is included in the CD, so that help is always available.\n\nVersions [^]\n\nRelease table DateVersion Clonezilla Live VersionSystemRescueCD Version 15/09/103.1.01.2.5-35 (mod)1.6.0 02/07/082.6.01.1.0-8 (mod)1.0.4 (mod) 11/04/082.5.01.0.10-8 (mod)1.0.1 (mod) 24/03/082.4.01.0.9-19 (mod)1.0.0 (mod) 07/03/082.3.01.0.9-10 (mod)1.0.0 (mod) 22/02/082.2.01.0.9-10 (mod)0.4.3 (mod) 22/01/082.1.01.0.7-18 (mod)0.4.3 (mod) 11/12/071.4.01.0.7-18 (mod)0.4.2 (mod) 03/11/071.3.01.0.5-8 (mod)0.4.1 (mod) 07/10/071.2.01.0.5-8 (mod)0.4.0 (mod) 24/09/071.1.01.0.5-7 (mod)0.3.8 (mod) 06/09/071.0.01.0.3-21 (mod)0.3.8 (mod) 12/08/070.21.0.3-21 (mod)0.3.7 (mod) 24/07/070.1.11.0.3-180.3.7 23/07/070.11.0.3-180.3.7\n\nChangelog [^]\n\nVersionPackage/CDComments 3.1.0CD - Clonezilla Live updated to version 1.2.5-35\n\n- SystemRescueCD updated to version 1.6.0\n\n- Three Clonezilla-SysRescCD flavours are now available,\n\none for each architecture (more information)\n\n- Super Grub Disk updated to version 0.9799\n\n- Added Super Grub Disk 2 version 1.98s\n\n- Smart Boot Manager was added to the Tools section\n\n- Added restorecd/ and docs/ to the squashfs file of Clonezilla distro.\n\nThis way all items are always available (even when booting to RAM)\n\n- Most operations are now executed through the TUI (Text User Interface)\n\n- Major site and documentation update (thanks to Jyrki Vesterinen) Package - Added auto mode (parameter -a) to script create-clonezilla-sysresccd 2.6.0CD - Clonezilla Live updated to version 1.1.0-8\n\n- SystemRescueCD updated to version 1.0.4\n\n- Super Grub Disk updated to version 0.9726 2.5.0CD - Clonezilla Live updated to version 1.0.10-8\n\n- SystemRescueCD updated to version 1.0.1\n\n- Super Grub Disk updated to version 0.9701 2.4.0CD - Clonezilla Live updated to version 1.0.9-19\n\n2.3.0CD - SystemRescueCD updated to version 1.0.0\n\n- Added two command line parameters to ocs-iso, used in auto restore DVD\n\nmastering. More info: Working with a USB keyboard Package - Fixed the create-clonezilla-sysresccd installation problem\n\nThanks to Chris Rehder 2.2.0CD - Clonezilla Live updated to version 1.0.9-10\n\n- Updated script reloc-img to support remote images (through samba and nfs) Package - Added patch-clonezilla-sysresccd, a script that can be used to\n\ncustomize an existing Clonezilla-SysRescCD ISO file\n\nMore info: Using patch-clonezilla-sysresccd 2.1.0CD - SystemRescueCD updated to version 0.4.3\n\n- Super Grub Disk updated to version 0.9677 1.4.0CD - A script to help relocate a Clonezilla image file during restoration\n\nhase been added to Clonezilla Live. The script (called reloc-img) uses\n\na curses like interface, which is similar to Clonezilla's interface\n\nMore info: Restoring to a different location 1.3.0CD - Changed the splash screen tool selection interface\n\nA navigation menu scheme has been adopted\n\n- Removed ranish.img from the CD\n\nThe Ranish Partition Manager has been integrated into FreeDos\n\nThis is because of the fact that Ranish Partition Manager would not\n\nexecute as a standalone floppy image\n\n- Added Super Grub Disk to the available tools\n\nThe floppy image provided by \"Super Grub Disk\" (english version)\n\nhas been added to the source tarball\n\n- Script continue-multi-cd (SysRescCD) updated to v 2.0.0\n\nUse \"continue-multi-cd -h\" to see the new interface\n\n- Fixed a minor bug in script what-cd Package - All the files needed for CD creation have been included in the\n\nsource tarball. This way the user will only have to download the\n\ndebian live ISO file, in order to create Clonezilla-SysRescCD.\n\nThe debian live ISO file has not been included because of its size\n\n(~ 79 MB), which would make the source tarball too big.\n\nThe files can be fount in /root/.clonezilla-sysresccd/files\n\n- All cfg files have been moved to /root/.clonezilla-sysresccd/files\n\nIf you are upgrading from a previous version, please delete/move\n\nthese files, and adjust your configuration files (conf files)\n\n- A new variable has been inserted to the configuration files (named\n\nDebianLiveFolder in clonezilla-sysresccd.conf and DebianLiveFolderP\n\nin profiles.conf). This variable should point to the folder where\n\nthe debian live ISO has been saved. If you are upgrading from a\n\nprevious version, please adjust your configuration files (conf files)\n\n- Added support to script create-clonezilla-sysresccd for compressed\n\n(tar.gz) isolinux configuration files, in order to implement menus 1.2.0CD- Added script continue-multi-cd to SystemRescueCD\n\nThis script makes it easy to continue a multi session CD 1.1.0CD- Minor changes (cfg files) 1.0.0- - Moved to version 1.0.0 in order to eliminate any missunderstanding about\n\nthe development status of Clonezilla-SysRescCD CD - Added the options -A and -W to script ocs-iso (Clonezilla Live).\n\nSyntax:\n\n/opt/drbl/sbin/ocs-iso -A \"ocs-rs command\"\n\n/opt/drbl/sbin/ocs-iso -W \"ocs-rs command\" [image file]\n\nBoth options set up the restore CD/DVD for automatic image restoration.\n\nThe difference is that when using the -W option the image [image file] is\n\nappended in the ISO file (maximum 4.4BG). When -A is used, the image\n\nfile will be appended to the CD/DVD, after the ISO file created by this\n\ncommand is burnt, using growisofs -M ... (maximum 8GB).\n\n- Added the option -O to script ocs-iso (Clonezilla Live).\n\nSpecifies the ISO file name to use when -A, -W options are used.\n\n- Added the options -V and -P to script ocs-iso (Clonezilla Live).\n\nThe user creating a restore CD/DVD can now specify its Volume ID and\n\nPublisher ID, respectively.\n\n- Added the option -I to script ocs-iso (Clonezilla Live).\n\nSpecifies the user selectable menu item title of the main screen of a\n\nrestore CD/DVD. Applicable only with options -W and -A\n\n- Added the script what-cd to sysresccd.\n\nThis script will identify the CDs present on a pc, and report the\n\ndevice name of the writer (if any)\n\n- Added a copy of the Clonezilla-SysRescCD site to the CD. In this way\n\nthe documentation will be available at all times Package - Added -x [script] option\n\nThis way you can write a BASH script that will be executed just\n\nbefore mastering the \"Clonezilla-SysRescCD\" 0.2CD - clonezilla-sysresccd contains customized versions of the original CDs\n\nMore info in page Custom CDs Package - Fixed a bug that would appear when option -b would be used without any\n\nother options. Then create-clonezilla-sysresccd would not be able to get the\n\nISO file name 0.1.1Package - Build system upgrade\n\nuse ./configure to upgrade the program\n\nuse ./configure --enable-fullInstall to install it\n\n- Fixed a potential script installation bug\n\n- Normal user can get help\n\n- Minor changes 0.1- Initial release\n\nCan I help? [^]\n\nYes, of course you can. If you have:\n\na script I can add to Clonezilla Live or SystemRescueCD, don't hesitate to send it to me.\n\nYou can have a look at \"Clonezilla-SysRescCD own scripts\" to see what type of scripts might be interesting.\n\nused Clonezilla Live nfs mode, or any of the tools provided by SystemRescueCD, you can write a guide.\n\nI will add it to the site (and the documentation present on the CD). Please keep in mind that this CD may be used by less experienced users, so make it as detailed as possible.\n\nContact me [^]\n\nIf there's anything you want to say about Clonezilla-SysRescCD, go ahead and send me a message.\n\nMailing lists [^]\n\nThere are two mailing lists available for Clonezilla-SysRescCD:\n\nClone-sysresccd-announce\n\nThis is the Clonezilla-SysRescCD new releases announcement list. Please do not post there.\n\nClone-sysresccd-general\n\nThis is the general discussion list of Clonezilla-SysRescCD.\n\nIf you have any questions about Clonezilla Live, please use its Mailing lists or Forums.\n\nIf you have any questions about SystemRescueCD, please use its Forums.\n\nLicense [^]\n\nThis project is published under the terms of GNU General Public License as published by the Free Software Foundation.\n\nCredits [^]\n\nI would like to thank:\n\nThe creators of SystemRescueCD and Clonezilla Live\n\nEleftherios Kosmas for publishing the v 0.1 torrent\n\nGeorge Keramidas and <<V13>> from the linux greek users mailing list, who helped fixing a bug that would make the creation of the 8GB Restore DVD impossible.\n\nChris Rehder for reporting the create-clonezilla-sysresccd installation problem in v 2.2.0 and his overall assistance\n\nManfred Hantl for reporting and fixing the windows USB installation problem of version 2.6.0\n\nEveryone who seeds the torrent, as it is not possible for me to be online at all times\n\nSpecial thanks to\n\nJyrki Vesterinen, documentation contributor.\n\nMost of these pages have been updated / written by him.\n\nInstallation to USB made easy [^]\n\nUntil recently installing Clonezilla-SysRescCD on a USB disk would not be such a great idea, because of its size. But since USB devices become cheaper and cheaper, it is an interesting alternative.\n\nStarting with version 3.1.0, Clonezilla-SysRescCD provides an iso file that's ISO-Hybrided. This means (as we read at the isolynux site) that\n\n\"the iso file can be booted from either CD-ROM or from a device which BIOS considers a hard disk or ZIP disk, e.g. a USB key or similar. This image can then be copied using any raw disk writing tool (on Unix systems, typically \"dd\" or \"cat\") to a USB disk, or written to a CD-ROM using standard CD burning tools.\n\nThe ISO 9660 filesystem is encapsulated in a partition (which starts at offset zero, which may confuse some systems.) This makes it possible for the operating system, once booted, to use the remainder of the device for persistent storage by creating a second partition.\"\n\nSo, from any linux box, assuming Clonezilla-SysRescCD iso file is in your home directory, and your USB device name is sdc4, you just execute the commands:\n\numount /dev/sdc4\n\ndd if=~/clonezilla-sysresccd-full-mod-3.1.0.iso of=/dev/sdc bs=512\n\nAnd that's it. Your usb device is ready to boot!!!\n\nUsing the extra space [^]\n\nIf your usb device is more than 400MB in size, the above command will leave the remaining space unused. To verify it, execute the command:\n\nfdisk -l /dev/sdc\n\nYou should get something similar to this:\n\nDisk /dev/sdc: 1048 MB, 1048576000 bytes\n\n64 heads, 32 sectors/track, 1000 cylinders, total 2048000 sectors\n\nUnits = sectors of 1 * 512 = 512 bytes\n\nSector size (logical/physical): 512 bytes / 512 bytes\n\nI/O size (minimum/optimal): 512 bytes / 512 bytes\n\nDisk identifier: 0x77a5188f\n\nDevice Boot Start End Blocks Id System /dev/sdc1 * 1 384 393216 17 Hidden HPFS/NTFS\n\nAs you can see, we are currently using 348 out of 1000 cylinders of the disk. The remaining disk space (~600MB) can still be used, executing the following commands:\n\nfdisk /dev/sdc\n\ncommand (m for help): n (create new partition)\n\ncommand action\n\ne extended\n\np primary partition (1-4)\n\np\n\npartition number (1-4): 4 (create partition sdc4)\n\nfirst cylinder (385-1000, default 385):\n\nusing default value 385\n\nlast cylinder, +cylinders or +size{k,m,g} (385-1000, default 1000):\n\nusing default value 1000\n\ncommand (m for help): p (display partition table)\n\ndisk /dev/sdc: 1048 mb, 1048576000 bytes\n\n64 heads, 32 sectors/track, 1000 cylinders\n\nunits = cylinders of 2048 * 512 = 1048576 bytes\n\nsector size (logical/physical): 512 bytes / 512 bytes\n\ni/o size (minimum/optimal): 512 bytes / 512 bytes\n\ndisk identifier: 0x77a5188f\n\ndevice boot start end blocks id system\n\n/dev/sdc1 * 1 384 393216 17 hidden hpfs/ntfs\n\n/dev/sdc4 385 1000 630784 83 linux\n\ncommand (m for help): t (change partition type)\n\npartition number (1-4): 4\n\nhex code (type l to list codes): b\n\nchanged system type of partition 4 to b (w95 fat32)\n\ncommand (m for help): p (display partition table)\n\ndisk /dev/sdc: 1048 mb, 1048576000 bytes\n\n64 heads, 32 sectors/track, 1000 cylinders\n\nunits = cylinders of 2048 * 512 = 1048576 bytes\n\nsector size (logical/physical): 512 bytes / 512 bytes\n\ni/o size (minimum/optimal): 512 bytes / 512 bytes\n\ndisk identifier: 0x77a5188f\n\ndevice boot start end blocks id system\n\n/dev/sdc1 * 1 384 393216 17 hidden hpfs/ntfs\n\n/dev/sdc4 385 1000 630784 b w95 fat32\n\ncommand (m for help): w (write partition table to disk and exit)\n\nThe partition table has been altered!\n\nCalling ioctl() to re-read partition table.\n\nWARNING: Re-reading the partition table failed with error 16: Device or resource busy.\n\nThe kernel still uses the old table. The new table will be used at\n\nthe next reboot or after you run partprobe(8) or kpartx(8)\n\nSyncing disks.\n\nAt this point you should disconnect and reconnect your usb device. When it's recognised, you can format the partition you've just created\n\nmkdosfs -F 32 /dev/sdc4\n\nThe partition is now ready for use!!!\n\nInstalling the \"hard\" way [^]\n\nIf the \"easy\" way does not work there is an alternative; you will use the Clonezilla-SysRescCD ISO file (or CD) to copy and modify a couple of files on the USB disk, and finally make it bootable, using syslinux and its configuration file syslinux.cfg.\n\nThe only thing that's important is that your USB disk must contain a VFAT (Windows 98 or DOS) file system. If this is not the case, refer to the section \"Troubleshooting\", to find out how you can format it, before copying files to it.\n\nThe bootable USB disk creation procedure can be performed either from Linux or Windows.\n\nInstallation from Linux [^]\n\nThere are two ways you can proceed, if you are going to use Linux to perform the USB installation, either using a running linux box, or using Clonezilla-SysRescCD.\n\nI will assume that you have saved clonezilla-sysresccd-full-mod-3.1.0.iso in your home directory (~).\n\nUsing a linux box [^]\n\nIf you already have a linux box up and running, you can use it to create your Clonezilla-SysRescCD USB, without even having to burn it to CD beforehand. The only thing here is that you have to have syslinux installed.\n\nI will assume that your CD drive is /dev/sr0 and that your USB device is /dev/sdc4. You may have to change any of them to reflect your system configuration.\n\nBoot into linux, connect your USB device and execute the following commands:\n\nmkdir /mnt/mycd\n\nmount ~/clonezilla-sysresccd-full-mod-3.1.0.iso /mnt/mycd -o loop\n\nmkdir /mnt/usbdevice\n\nmount /dev/sdc4 /mnt/usbdevice\n\ncp -r /mnt/mycd/* /mnt/usbdevice\n\numount /mnt/mycd; rmdir /mnt/mycd\n\ncd /mnt/usbdevice\n\nrm isolinux/*.cfg\n\nmv isolinux/* .\n\nrmdir isolinux\n\ncd; umount /dev/sdc4\n\nrmdir /mnt/usbdevice\n\nFinally make your USB device bootable, by executing\n\nsyslinux /dev/sdc4\n\nand you are done.\n\nUsing Clonezilla-SysRescCD [^]\n\nIf you already burnt Clonezilla-SysRescCD to CD, you can use it to create your Clonezilla-SysRescCD USB.\n\nI will assume that your CD drive is /dev/sr0 and that your USB device is /dev/sdc4. You may have to change any of them to reflect your system configuration.\n\nBoot SystemRescueCD using the option To RAM, and when it is fully loaded, execute the following commands:\n\nmkdir /mnt/mycd\n\nmount /dev/sr0 /mnt/mycd\n\nmkdir /mnt/usbdevice\n\nmount /dev/sdc4 /mnt/usbdevice\n\ncp -r /mnt/mycd/* /mnt/usbdevice\n\numount /mnt/mycd\n\ncd /mnt/usbdevice\n\nrm isolinux/*.cfg\n\nmv isolinux/* .\n\nrmdir isolinux\n\ncd; umount /dev/sdc4\n\nFinally make your USB device bootable, by executing\n\nsyslinux /dev/sdc4\n\nand you are done.\n\nInstallation from Windows [^]\n\nInstalling Clonezilla-SysRescCD from Windows is as easy as it is in Linux. You have to burn Clonezilla-SysRescCD to CD or use a CD/DVD ROM emulator software like Daemon Tools to mount the ISO file.\n\nI will assume that your USB device is drive K: and your CD drive or mounted ISO file is drive D:. You may have to change any of them, in order to reflect your system configuration.\n\nYou will have to\n\nCopy all files from drive D: (CD or mounted ISO file) to drive K: (USB disk)\n\nDelete all cfg files from K:isolinux\n\nMove all files from K:isolinux to K:\n\nDelete folder K:isolinux\n\nNow all you have to do is make your USB disk bootable. In order to do that you have to open a DOS window (in Windows XP press \"Start / Run \" and type cmd). Then type at DOS prompt:\n\nK:\n\ncd utils/bootprog\n\nsyslinux -ma K:\n\nBooting from USB [^]\n\nBefore trying to boot from your USB device, you have to set your boot device at your BIOS. This means you have to reboot having your USB device connected, get into your BIOS (usually pressing DEL) and make the appropriate settings in the BOOT section.\n\nBooting Clonezilla Live should not be a problem. Just select the desired option and press ENTER to boot.\n\nBooting SystemRescueCD has been made equally simple with SystemRescueCD v 1.0.0, so you shouldn't have any problem (option cdroot is not required any more).\n\nIf you have any problems here, you may try adding any of these boot parameters:\n\nusbstick\n\ndoscsi\n\nTroubleshooting [^]\n\nWhether you can successfully boot from a USB disk or not, depends mainly on your BIOS. Chances are that you will not be able to boot on an old computer, with an old (and possibly buggy) BIOS. So I would recommend testing your Clonezilla-SysRescCD USB on a new computer.\n\nI can't boot (I don't even see the splash screen)\n\nor Clonezilla Live does not boot\n\nThe first thing you should do is double check your BIOS settings. Reboot having your USB device connected, get into your BIOS (usually pressing DEL) and make the appropriate settings in the BOOT section.\n\nIf you are on linux, check that the partition on the USB disk is active (bootable), executing:\n\nfdisk -l /dev/sdc\n\nYou should get something similar to this:\n\nDisk /dev/sdc: 1031 MB, 1031798272 bytes\n\n64 heads, 32 sectors/track, 983 cylinders\n\nUnits = cylinders of 2048 * 512 = 1048576 bytes\n\nDevice Boot Start End Blocks Id System\n\n/dev/sdc4 * 1 983 1006576 6 FAT16\n\nIf the partition is not active (no astrisk), execute:\n\nfdisk /dev/sdc\n\nand issue \"Command: \" a (toggle a bootable flag) and \"Partition number:\" 4 (for /dev/sdc4).\n\nIf you are on Windows, this is taken care of by syslinux (parameters -ma).\n\nIf you still have problems booting, you should try to execute\n\nsyslinux -s /dev/sdc4\n\nfrom Linux, or\n\nsyslinux -sma K:\n\nfrom Windows (from folder K:syslinux).\n\nsyslinux man page reads:\n\n(Option) -s\n\nInstall a \"safe, slow and stupid\" version of syslinux. This version may work\n\non some very buggy BIOSes on which syslinux would otherwise fail. If you find\n\na machine on which the -s option is required to make it boot reliably, please\n\nsend as much info about your machine as you can, and include the failure mode.\n\nI still can't boot\n\nIn this case you will have to format your USB disk.\n\nIf you are using linux to perform the installation, execute the command:\n\nmkdosfs -F 16 /dev/sdc4\n\nto create a FAT16 file system, or\n\nmkdosfs -F 32 /dev/sdc4\n\nto create a FAT32 file system.\n\nWhen you are done go back to section \"Installation from Linux\".\n\nIf you are on Windows, you should download the HP-USB Format tool, install it and format your USB drive using the Fat or Fat32 option. This program can be used to format USB devices that won't boot properly when formatted with Windows format tool.\n\nWhen you are done go back to section \"Installation from Windows\".\n\nI still can't boot (after formating)\n\nThings are getting tough!!! Try to format your USB disk using the option you did not use previously. So, if you have created a FAT32 file system, create a FAT16 file system this time, and recreate Clonezilla-SysRescCD on USB.\n\nIf nothing works, you are out of luck; you will not be able to use Clonezilla-SysRescCD USB on this computer... If you do manage to boot it, please send me a message.\n\nSystemRescueCD does not boot\n\nOk, you have managed to get to the splash screen and successfully booted Clonezilla Live. But you still can't boot SystemRescueCD.\n\nRefer to section Booting from USB to find out the boot parameters you can use with SystemRescueCD.\n\nCustomizing sysresc.cfg [^]\n\nAs stated previously, Clonezilla-SysRescCD USB is booted by syslinux through its configuration file syslinux.cfg. This file loads sysresc.cfg in order to boot SystemRescueCD.\n\nIf you have to specify any additional boot parameters for SystemRescueCD, you may want to write these changes to the configuration file, so that you don't have to insert them by hand every time.\n\nThe procedure to do that is the following:\n\nBoot SystemRescueCD (or if that's not possible yet, bot Clonezilla Linux and get to the command line) using the option To RAM, and when it is fully loaded, execute the following commands:\n\nmkdir /mnt/usbdevice\n\nmount /dev/[device] /mnt/usbdevice\n\ncd /mnt/usbdevice\n\ncp sysresc.cfg sysresc.bak\n\nsed 's|scandelay=5|scandelay=x [additional params]|'\n\nsysresc.cfg > sys.cfg\n\nmv sys.cfg sysresc.cfg\n\ncd; umount /dev/[device]\n\nsyslinux /dev/[device]\n\nreboot\n\nwhere x is a number from 1 to 10.\n\nAfter executing these commands, you will have a new sysresc.cfg file, and a backup file called sysresc.bak (in case things go wrong).\n\nIf, for example, you want to increase the device scan delay to maximum, the above commands would become:\n\nmkdir /mnt/usbdevice\n\nmount /dev/sdc4 /mnt/usbdevice\n\ncd /mnt/usbdevice\n\ncp sysresc.cfg sysresc.bak\n\nsed 's|scandelay=5|scandelay=10|' sysresc.cfg > sys.cfg\n\nmv sys.cfg sysresc.cfg\n\ncd; umount /dev/sdc4\n\nsyslinux /dev/sdc4\n\nreboot\n\nIf, in addition to that, you had to use the boot parameter usbstick, then it would be:\n\nmkdir /mnt/usbdevice\n\nmount /dev/sdc4 /mnt/usbdevice\n\ncd /mnt/usbdevice\n\ncp sysresc.cfg sysresc.bak\n\nsed 's|scandelay=5|scandelay=10 usbstick|' sysresc.cfg > sys.cfg\n\nmv sys.cfg sysresc.cfg\n\ncd; umount /dev/sdc4\n\nsyslinux /dev/sdc4\n\nreboot\n\nIn case something goes wrong with your new settings, you can always rename sysresc.bak to sysresc.cfg, either from linux or Windows.\n\nBoot parameters [^]\n\nBooting a linux system means loading a kernel, which is actually the operating system. Well, this is not exactly true, and it is not the only thing that happens during boot up phase, but it is not my intension to explain it here.\n\nThe kernel is loaded by Isolinux (the CD boot manager), which is able to pass a number of parameters to it, through its configuration file isolinux.cfg.\n\nThese parameters, called boot parameters, are documented by the kernel itself, and can differentiate its behavior dramatically. In our case, each CD (SystemRescueCD and Clonezilla Live) accept a different set of parameters, because they are based on gentoo and debian, respectively.\n\nWhile in the splash screen of Clonezilla-SysRescCD, you can edit the boot parameters by pressing TAB. They will be presented to you, and you can add or remove what you want. You must be careful not to change or remove the parameters that are dedicated to the CD itself, as altering them will certainty make it unbootable. When you are done, just press ENTER to boot.\n\nSystemRescueCD boot parameters [^]\n\nA typical sysresccd isolinux entry is:\n\nkernel rescuecd\n\nappend initrd=initram.igz video=ofonly\n\nThe kernel used is rescuecd, and anything after the word append is a boot parameter.\n\nAvailable kernels (boot images):\n\nrescuecd Default for 32bit systems, with Framebuffer disabled, best choice.\n\nrescue64 Default 64 bit kernel. Use it if you want to chroot to a 64bit linux system installed on your hard disk, or if you have to run 64 bits programs. This kernel is able to boot with 32bit programs, and it requires a processor with 64bit instructions (amd64 / em64t).\n\naltker32 an alternative kernel for 32bit systems. Boot with this kernel if you have problems with rescuecd\n\naltker64 an alternative kernel for 64bit systems. Boot with this kernel in case you have problems with rescue64.\n\nThe boot parameters you can use are:\n\nClonezilla Live boot parameters [^]\n\nA typical Clonezilla Live isolinux entry is:\n\nkernel /live/vmlinuz1\n\nappend initrd=/live/initrd1.img boot=live union=aufs ocs_live_run=\"ocs-live-general\"\n\nocs_live_extra_param=\"\" ocs_live_keymap=\"\" ocs_live_batch=\"no\" ocs_lang=\"\" vga=791 nolocales\n\nThe kernel used is vmlinuz, and anything after the word append is a boot parameter.\n\nThe following info comes from the page titled The boot parameters for Clonezilla live.\n\nlive-initramfs manual [^]\n\nThis is the manual of live-initramfs\n\nlive-initramfs(7) ================= Name ---- live-initramfs - Debian Live initramfs hook Synopsis -------- BOOT=live as kernel parameter at boot prompt. Description ----------- live-initramfs is a hook for the initramfs-tools, used to generate a initramfs capable to boot live systems, such as those created by *live-helper*(7). This includes the Debian Live isos, netboot tarballs, and usb stick images. At boot time it will look for a (read-only) media containing a \"/live\" directory where a root filesystems (often a compressed filesystem image like squashfs) is stored. If found, it will create a writable environment, using aufs, for Debian like systems to boot from. You probably do not want to install this package onto a non-live system, although it will do no harm. live-initramfs is a fork of casper. casper was originally written by Tollef Fog Heen &lt;tfheen@canonical.com&gt; and Matt Zimmerman &lt;mdz@canonical.com&gt;. Boot options ------------ Here is the complete list of recognized boot parameters by live-initramfs. access=*ACCESS*:: Set the accessibility level for physically or visually impared users. ACCESS must be one of v1, v2, v3, m1, or m2. v1=lesser visual impairment, v2=moderate visual impairment, v3=blindness, m1=minor motor difficulties, m2=moderate motor difficulties. console=*TTY,SPEED*:: Set the default console to be used with the \"live-getty\" option. Example: \"console=ttyS0,115200\" debug:: Makes initramfs boot process more verbose. fetch=*URL*:: Another form of netboot by downloading a squashfs image from a given url, copying to ram and booting it. hostname=*HOSTNAME*, username=*USER*, userfullname=*USERFULLNAME*:: Those parameters lets you override values read from the config file. ignore_uuid Do not check that any UUID embedded in the initramfs matches the discovered medium. live-initramfs may be told to generate a UUID by setting LIVE_GENERATE_UUID=1 when building the initramfs. integrity-check:: If specified, an MD5 sum is calculated on the live media during boot and compared to the value found in md5sum.txt found in the root directory of the live media. ip=**[CLIENT_IP]:[SERVER_IP]:[GATEWAY_IP]:[NETMASK]:[HOSTNAME]: [DEVICE]:[AUTOCONF] [,[CLIENT_IP]:[SERVER_IP]:[GATEWAY_IP]:[NETMASK]:[HOSTNAME]: [DEVICE]:[AUTOCONF]]***:: Let you specify the name(s) and the options of the interface(s) that should be configured at boot time. Do not specify this if you want to use dhcp (default). It will be changed in a future release to mimick official kernel boot param specification (e.g. ip=10.0.0.1::10.0.0.254:255.255.255.0::eth0,:::::eth1:dhcp). ip[=**frommedia**]:: If this variable is set, dhcp and static configuration are just skipped and the system will use the (must be) media-preconfigured /etc/network/interfaces instead. {keyb|kbd-chooser/method}=**KEYBOARD**, {klayout|console-setup/layoutcode}=**LAYOUT**, {kvariant|console-setup/variantcode}=**VARIANT**, {kmodel|console-setup/modelcode}= **CODE**, koptions=**OPTIONS**:: Configure the running keyboard as specified, if this one misses live-initramfs behaves as if \"keyb=us\" was specified. It will be interfered from \"locale=\" if locale is only 2 lowecase letters as a special case. You could also specify console layout, variant, code, and options (no defaults). live-getty:: This changes the auto-login on virtual terminals to use the (experimental) live-getty code. With this option set the standard kernel argument \"console=\" is parsed and if a serial console is specified then live-getty is used to autologin on the serial console. {live-media|bootfrom}=**DEVICE**:: If you specify one of this two equivalent forms, live-initramfs will first try to find this device for the \"/live\" directory where the read-only root filesystem should reside. If it did not find something usable, the normal scan for block devices is performed. {live-media-encryption|encryption}=**TYPE**:: live-initramfs will mount the encrypted rootfs TYPE, asking the passphrase, useful to build paranoid live systems :-). TYPE supported so far are \"aes\" for loop-aes encryption type. live-media-offset=**BYTES**:: This way you could tell live-initramfs that your image starts at offset BYTES in the above specified or autodiscovered device, this could be useful to hide the Debian Live iso or image inside another iso or image, to create \"clean\" images. live-media-path=**PATH**:: Sets the path to the live filesystem on the medium. By default, it is set to '/live' and you should not change that unless you have customized your media accordingly. live-media-timeout=**SECONDS**:: Set the timeout in seconds for the device specified by \"live-media=\" to become ready before giving up. {locale|debian-installer/locale}=**LOCALE**:: Configure the running locale as specified, if not present the live-media rootfs configured locale will be used and if also this one misses live-initramfs behave as \"locale=en_US.UTF-8\" was specified. If only 2 lowercase letter are specified (like \"it\"), the \"maybe wanted\" locale is generated (like en:EN.UTF-8), in this case if also \"keyb=\" is unspecified is set with those 2 lowercase letters (keyb=us). Beside that facility, only UTF8 locales are supported by live-initramfs. module=**NAME**:: Instead of using the default optional file \"filesystem.module\" (see below) another file could be specified without the extension \".module\"; it should be placed on \"/live\" directory of the live medium. netboot[=**nfs**|**cifs**]:: This tells live-initramfs to perform a network mount. The parameter \"nfsroot=\" (with optional \"nfsopts=\"), should specify where is the location of the root filesystem. With no args, will try cifs first, and if it fails nfs. nfsopts=:: This lets you specify custom nfs options. noautologin:: This parameter disables the automatic terminal login only, not touching gdk/kdm. noxautologin:: This parameter disables the automatic login of gdm/kdm only, not touching terminals. nofastboot:: This parameter disables the default disabling of filesystem checks in /etc/fstab. If you have static filesystems on your harddisk and you want them to be checked at boot time, use this parameter, otherwise they are skipped. nopersistent:: disables the \"persistent\" feature, useful if the bootloader (like syslinux) has been installed with persistent enabled. noprompt Do not prompt to eject the CD on reboot. nosudo:: This parameter disables the automatic configuration of sudo. swapon:: This parameter enables usage of local swap partitions. nouser:: This parameter disables the creation of the default user completely. noxautoconfig:: This parameter disables Xorg auto-reconfiguration at boot time. This is valuable if you either do the detection on your own, or, if you want to ship a custom, premade xorg.conf in your live system. persistent[=nofiles]:: live-initramfs will look for persistent and snapshot partitions or files labeled \"live-rw\", \"home-rw\", and files called \"live-sn*\", \"home-sn*\" and will try to, in order: mount as /cow the first, mount the second in /home, and just copy the contents of the latter in appropriate locations (snapshots). Snapshots will be tried to be updated on reboot/shutdown. Look at live-snapshot(1) for more informations. If \"nofiles\" is specified, only filesystems with matching labels will be searched; no filesystems will be traversed looking for archives or image files. This results in shorter boot times. {preseed/file|file}=**FILE**:: A path to a file present on the rootfs could be used to preseed debconf database. package/question=**VALUE**:: All debian installed packages could be preseeded from command-line that way, beware of blanks spaces, they will interfere with parsing, use a preseed file in this case. quickreboot:: This option causes live-initramfs to reboot without attempting to eject the media and without asking the user to remove the boot media. showmounts:: This parameter will make live-initramfs to show on \"/\" the ro filesystems (mostly compressed) on \"/live\". This is not enabled by default because could lead to problems by applications like \"mono\" which store binary paths on installation. textonly Start up to text-mode shell prompts, disabling the graphical user interface. timezone=**TIMEZONE**:: By default, timezone is set to UTC. Using the timezone parameter, you can set it to your local zone, e.g. Europe/Zurich. todisk=**DEVICE**:: Adding this parameter, live-initramfs will try to copy the entire read-only media to the specified device before mounting the root filesystem. It probably needs a lot of free space. Subsequent boots should then skip this step and just specify the \"live-media=DEVICE\" boot parameter with the same DEVICE used this time. toram:: Adding this parameter, live-initramfs will try to copy the whole read-only media to the computer's RAM before mounting the root filesystem. This could need a lot of ram, according to the space used by the read-only media. union=**aufs**|**unionfs**:: By default, live-initramfs uses aufs. With this parameter, you can switch to unionfs. utc=**yes**|**no**:: By default, Debian systems do assume that the hardware clock is set to UTC. You can change or explicitly set it with this parameter. xdebconf:: Uses xdebconfigurator, if present on the rootfs, to configure X instead of the standard procedure (experimental). xvideomode=**RESOLUTION**:: Doesn't do xorg autodetection, but enforces a given resolution. Files ----- /etc/live.conf Some variables can be configured via this config file (inside the live system). /live/filesystem.module This optional file (inside the live media) contains a list of white-space or carriage-return-separated file names corresponding to disk images in the \"/live\" directory. If this file exists, only images listed here will be merged into the root aufs, and they will be loaded in the order listed here. The first entry in this file will be the \"lowest\" point in the aufs, and the last file in this list will be on the \"top\" of the aufs, directly below /cow. Without this file, any images in the \"/live\" directory are loaded in alphanumeric order. /etc/live-persistence.binds This optional file (which resides in the rootfs system, not in the live media) is used as a list of directories which not need be persistent: ie. their content does not need to survive reboots when using the persistence features. This saves expensive writes and speeds up operations on volatile data such as web caches and temporary files (like e.g. /tmp and .mozilla) which are regenerated each time. This is achieved by bind mounting each listed directory with a tmpfs on the original path.

It is an extremely useful tool, however, it does have several limitations. In order to use it, you must first prepare a DRBL server AND the machine to be cloned must boot from a network (e.g. PXE/Etherboot).\n\nTo address these limitations, the Free Software Lab at the NCHC has combined Debian Live with Clonezilla to produce \"Clonezilla Live\", a new software that can be used to easily clone individual machines.\n\nClonezilla Live provides two modes of operation:\n\ndevice-image\n\nIn this mode of operation, a disk/partition can be saved to an image file. This image file can be used to restore the original disk/partition. With Clonezilla-SysRescCD, it can also be used to create an automated restore CD/DVD. This is the mode of operation we will discuss here.\n\ndevice-device (cloning)\n\nThis mode of operation creates an exact copy of the original disk/partition on the fly.\n\nWhen working in device-image mode, you will always have to specify three things:\n\nThe location of the image file\n\nThe working parameters for the operation\n\nThe disk/partition that will be saved/restored\n\nClonezilla Live provides a user friendly interface in order to insert this data.\n\nWhen Clonezilla Live is booted up, either normally or copied to RAM, the contents of the whole CD/DVD can be found in folder /live/image. This is where you will find any extra files, such as the restorecd and the doc folders.\n\nStarting and stopping Clonezilla Live [^]\n\nWhen you boot into Clonezilla Live, the program (actually a script) starts automatically. There are many places where you can stop it, by selecting Cancel or answering N(o) to a question. When you do that you will probably get the following:\n\nNow you can choose to:\n\n(0) Poweroff\n\n(1) Reboot\n\n(2) Enter command line prompt\n\n(3) Start over\n\n[2]\n\nSelect Poweroff or Reboot, only if you haven't already mounted a disk partition. I found out by experience, it is not always safe to let any live CD automatically unmount my partitions. So if you have already specified the image partition and/or the partition to save/restore, you should enter command line prompt and type:\n\nsudo su -\n\nmount | grep /dev/[sh]d\n\nand then unmount the partitions shown by the last command. So if the results of this command is for example:\n\n/dev/hda1 on /home/partimag type vfat (rw)\n\njust type the command:\n\numount /dev/hda1\n\nand it's now safe to Poweroff of Reboot.\n\nIf, on the other hand, you just want to restart the program, type:\n\nocs-live\n\nAbout the Image file [^]\n\nOne thing should be made clear about the image file: it is not a file, it is a folder, containing the actual image file and some data about the disk/partition it is associated with. So when you insert the image file name, you actually insert the folder name where the image will be saved/restored.\n\nBefore you are able to insert the image file name, a list of partitions will be presented to you, so that you can choose where it should be saved/found. When you select one of them, it will be mounted and a list of folders will be presented to you, so you can select the base image directory (first level directory within the partition), which will then be mounted under /home/partimag. This way you can, for example, create a folder called all_my_images in one of your disk partitions, and move all your image files in there; Clonezilla Live will be able to find them!!!\n\nAnother thing that should be pointed out is that only unmounted partitions will be included in the above list. This means that if you have stopped the program at some point after specifying the partition where the image file resides, and it has been mounted, it will not be present in the list the next time it is presented to you, and you will not be able to use it.\n\nThere are two things you can do in this case; either unmount the partition, as stated above, or select\n\nskip Use existing /home/partimag\n\ninstead of any other option, when you restart the program. The later of course means that you still want to use the previously specified partition as the image file location.\n\nFianlly I should say that Clonezilla Live is able to use a remote disk/partition as the location of the image file, mounted through ssh, samba or nfs. Using any of these options is a more advanced topic, way beyond the scope of this presentation.\n\nScripts' options [^]\n\nThis section presents the options which are available at the \"Clonezilla advanced extra parameters\" screens, if the \"Expert\" mode is selected. For other options, see Getting backups and Restoring data.\n\nBackup options [^]\n\nImaging program priority [^]\n\n-q2 Priority: partclone > partimage > dd\n\n-q1 Priority: Only dd (supports all filesystem, but inefficient)\n\n-q Priority: ntfsclone > partimage > dd\n\nPriority: partimage > dd (no ntfsclone)\n\nThis option chooses which imaging programs are preferred. By default, Clonezilla Live uses partclone for nearly all filesystems, including ext2/3/4, NTFS and FAT32. If a filesystem isn't supported by partclone, but is supported by partimage (spesifically: if the filesystem is HFS, HPFS or JFS), it is cloned by partimage. If it isn't supported by either (for example Linux swap, though it doesn't make any sense to clone swap partitions), it is cloned by dd. Unlike partclone or partimage, dd copies all blocks of the partition instead of only used, resulting in slower imaging process and bigger images.\n\nNormally the default option -q2 should be preferred. Try another option if you have problems and believe they are caused by the imaging program used.\n\nVarious parameters [^]\n\nThese options are available at the second \"Clonezilla advanced extra parameters\" screen.\n\n-c Client waits for confirmation before cloning\n\nThis option causes Clonezilla Live to ask if you really want to clone the disk/partition just before it starts cloning. It is enabled by default.\n\n-j2 Clone the hidden data between MBR and 1st partition\n\nIf this option is set, the 15 hidden sectors between Master Boot Record and the first partition are copied. This area usually contains some data necessary for booting. The option is enabled by default and should be kept enabled if you are cloning a bootable disk.\n\n-nogui Use text output only, no TUI/GUI output\n\nCauses Clonezilla Live to force the used programs to use only command-line interface even if text-based or graphical user interface is available.\n\n-a Do NOT force to turn on HD DMA\n\nPrevents Clonezilla Live from using DMA for communicating with hard drives. Slows cloning down but in some conditions cloning without this option can be impossible.\n\n-rm-win-swap-hib Remove page and hibernation files in Win if exists\n\nThis option prevents Clonezilla Live from cloning your page file if you are cloning a partition containing Windows. Often the page file is big and unneeded, and skipping it may speed cloning up without causing any harm. Mind you, this option is disabled by default because sometimes the page file may be necessary.\n\n-ntfs-ok Skip checking NTFS integrity, even bad sectors (ntfsclone only)\n\nThis option works only if you selected the -q option and you're cloning a NTFS partition. It prevents the integrity check of NTFS partitions and speeds the cloning process up a little. However, if the check is disabled, there is a risk that the filesystem is damaged and the image created from it is useless.\n\n-rescue Continue reading next one when disk blocks read errors\n\nIf this option is set, Clonezilla Live continues cloning even if a read error occurs. If there is one, the disk image will be corrupted, but failing hard drives can only be cloned with this option enabled.\n\n-fsck-src-part Check and repair source file system before saving\n\nThis option causes Clonezilla Live to check the integrity of the partition(s) to be cloned. If the filesystem of the partition is damaged, Clonezilla Live also attempts to repair it automatically. Enabling this option reduces the risk that the image contains a damaged filesystem. However, the option is disabled by default because the automatic filesystem repair attempt may cause data loss.\n\n-gm Generate image MD5 checksums\n\nCauses Clonezilla Live to calculate MD5 checksum(s) of image(s) created. If the image gets corrupted afterwards, the checksum allows to notice the corruption before the image is restored. Mind you, calculating the checksum takes some time and slows the process down a little.\n\n-gs Generate image SHA1 checksums\n\nThis option is identical to the above, but creates SHA1 checksum(s) instead of MD5. SHA1 is considered to be more accurate checksum algorithm than MD5, but MD5 is more popular.\n\nCompression method [^]\n\n-z1p Use parallel gzip compression (testing), for multicore/CPU\n\n-z1 gzip compression (fast with a smaller image)\n\n-z2p Use parallel bzip2 compression (testing), for multicore/CPU\n\n-z2 bzip2 compression (slowest but smallest image)\n\n-z3 lzo compression (faster with image size approx. to that of gzip)(NOTE!!)\n\n-z4 lzma_compression_(slowest_but_also_small_image,_faster_decompression_than_bzip2)\n\n-z5p Use_parallel_xz_compression_(testing),_for_multicore/CPU\n\n-z5 xz_compression_(slowest_but_also_small_image,_faster_decompression_than_bzip2)\n\n-z6p Use_parallel_lzip_compression_(testing),_for_multicore/CPU\n\n-z6 lzip_compression_(slowest_but_also_small_image,_faster_decompression_than_bzip2)\n\n-z0 No compression (fastest but largest image size)\n\nThis option chooses the method which is used to compress the image while creating it.\n\nIf no compression is used at all, there won't be any negative speed impact caused by compression. However, the image file size is the size of all the data backed up - for example, if you clone a 160 GB hard drive containing 60 gigabytes of data, the resulting disk image will be 60 gigabytes in size.\n\nGzip and lzop are fast compression methods. Lzop is many times faster than gzip, but creates slightly larger images. Clonezilla Live warns that lzop requires good-quality RAM, but I (the contributor who wrote this chapter) think other compression methods require good RAM too.\n\nBzip2, lzma, xz and lzip are powerful compression methods. Lzma creates a little smaller images than bzip2, and decompressing lzma-compressed images is faster than decompressing bzip2 images. But there is no free lunch: lzma compression method is very slow compared even to bzip2, which isn't fast method either.\n\nLzma method is becoming obsolete, and both xz and lzip are attempting to become its successor. They are a bit less powerful compression methods than lzma, but much faster. The differences between xz and lzip are virtually non-existent.\n\nIf you don't use the i486 version of Clonezilla-SysRescCD and your processor contains multiple cores and/or supports Hyper-Threading, parallel gzip, bzip2, xz and lzip compression methods are also available. Parallel compression means that each processor core compresses a different part of the image at a time. Without parallel compression one core compresses everything.\n\nThe speed impact caused by parallel compression depends on the number of processor cores available. In addition, Hyper-Threading increases the speed by about 30 % if parallel compression is used. For example, if your processor contains four cores and supports Hyper-Threading, speed with parallel compression is nearly 5,2 times as high as without. However, parallel compression is currently an experimental feature.\n\nSplitting [^]\n\nThis option (command line: -i [number]) decides if the created image files are splitted into smaller pieces, and if yes, how large the pieces are. This setting doesn't usually matter, but some filesystems (most importantly FAT32) don't allow files larger than four gigabytes. If you're saving the disk image to a FAT32 partition, enter 4000 or less. (Value 0 disables splitting, so don't use it in that case.) If the filesystem allows files big enough, enter any value which isn't too small (you don't want to split the image into too many pieces, do you?)\n\nClonezilla Live warns that it is no longer safe to disable splitting because value 0 can confuse init. I (the contributor) don't know what the warning exactly means and haven't been able to reproduce the problem. Anyway, entering a very big value, for example 999999999999, is a safe way to keep the image in one piece.\n\nPostaction [^]\n\n-p true Do nothing when the clone finishes\n\n-p reboot Reboot client when the clone finishes\n\n-p poweroff Shutdown client when the clone finishes\n\nIn this screen you can decide what Clonezilla Live does when the disk/partition is cloned.\n\nSpiros told above that he has found out that it's not always safe to allow Live CDs automatically unmount partitions, and I have lost data when trying auto-unmount with a script. So, avoid -p reboot and -p poweroff options if possible. You have been warned.\n\nRestore options (script ocs-sr) [^]\n\nVarious parameters [^]\n\nThese options are available at the first \"Clonezilla advanced extra parameters\" screen.\n\n-g auto Reinstall grub in client disk MBR (only if grub config exists)\n\nCauses Clonezilla Live to reinstall GRUB into the Master Boot Record of the disk if at least one partition contains GRUB config file (/boot/grub/menu.lst). The option is enabled by default and shouldn't cause any harm. However, it should be disabled if you for example have another bootloader in MBR and chainload GRUB with it.\n\n-e1 auto Automatically adjust filesystem geometry for a NTFS boot partition if exists\n\nThe NTLDR bootloader used by Windows isn't able to determine automatically where the files it needs are stored. It only knows their physical locations, which sometimes change when the disk or partition is copied. If the locations are changed and this option is selected, the location information of the files is changed accordingly. This option is enabled by default and if it's disabled, the cloned Windows will fail to boot.\n\n-e2 sfdisk uses CHS of hard drive from EDD(for non-grub boot loader)\n\nThis option requires that the -e1 auto option is selected. It causes Clonezilla Live to use disk read interface named EDD for determining the physical locations of the files when updating the location information used by NTLDR. The option is enabled by default because it reduces the risk that Windows doesn't boot.\n\n-hn0 PC Change MS Win hostname (based on IP address) after clone\n\nIf this option is selected and a partition containing Microsoft Windows is cloned, its IP address -based hostname is changed after cloning. Computers which are on any network simultaneously need to have different hostnames, so this option is needed if a Windows system is cloned to another computer and the original computer is still used in addition to the one where the image was restored to.\n\n-hn1 PC Change MS Win hostname (based on MAC address) after clone\n\nThis option causes the MAC address -based hostname of Windows to change. This option needs also be enabled in the above condition.\n\n-v Prints verbose messages (especially for udpcast)\n\nCauses Clonezilla Live to tell more information of what it does.\n\n-nogui Use text output only, no TUI/GUI output\n\nCauses Clonezilla Live to force the used programs to use only command-line interface even if text-based or graphical user interface is available.\n\n-b Run clone in batch mode (DANGEROUS!)\n\nCauses Clonezilla Live to run in batch mode. According to Clonezilla Live reference card, this option is dangerous, though I (the contributor) don't know why.\n\n-c Client waits for confirmation before cloning\n\nThis option causes Clonezilla Live to ask if you really want to clone the disk/partition just before it starts cloning. It is enabled by default.\n\n-t Client does not restore the MBR (Mater Boot Record)\n\nDo NOT restore the MBR (Mater Boot Record) when restoring image. If this option is set, you must make sure there is an existing MBR in the current restored harddisk. Default is Yes.\n\n-t1 Client restores the prebuilt MBR from syslinux (For Windows only)\n\nIf this option is set, the MBR is overwritten by prebuilt one which chainloads Windows. Use this option if you have to restore Windows and make it bootable, but don't have the original MBR or backup of it.\n\n-r Try to resize the filesystem to fit partition size\n\nThis option is useful if you are cloning a small disk to larger one. It tries to resize the restored filesystem to the size of the partition where it was restored to. It allows you to use the whole size of your new disk without resizing the partition afterwards. The option requires that the disk where the image is copied to already contains a partition where the image is restored or that the option -k1 is enabled.\n\n-e sfdisk uses the CHS value of hard drive from the saved image\n\nForce to use the saved CHS (cylinders, heads, sectors) when using sfdisk. Of cource, there is no use of it when using any of -j0, -k or -k2 options.\n\n-icrc Ignore CRC checking of partclone\n\nThis option causes partclone to skip checking the CRC32 checksums of the image. Enabling this option speeds the restore process up. However, if this option is enabled and the -cm and -cs options are disabled, there is no way to notice if the image has corrupted.\n\n-j1 Write MBR (512 B) again after image is restored. Not OK for partition table diffe\n\nWhen a disk image is restored, the partition table must be updated to reflect the actual partitions in the disk. If you don't want it to happen, enable this option. Then the Master Boot Record (including the partition table) is restored again after restoring the image. Note that using this option can destroy all the data in the target drive.\n\n-j2 Clone the hidden data between MBR and 1st partition\n\nIf this option is set, the 15 hidden sectors between Master Boot Record and the first partition are restored. This area usually contains some data necessary for booting. The option is enabled by default and should be kept enabled if you are cloning a bootable disk.\n\n-cm Check image by MD5 checksums\n\nIf the image folder contains MD5 checksum(s), this option causes Clonezilla Live to check if the image has corrupted by calculating its checksum and comparing it to the precalculated one. Mind you, calculating the checksum takes some time and slows the process down a little.\n\n-cs Check image by SHA1 checksums\n\nThis option is identical to the above, but checks SHA1 checksum(s) instead of MD5.\n\n-a Do NOT force to turn on HD DMA\n\nPrevents Clonezilla Live from using DMA for communicating with hard drives. Slows cloning down but in some conditions cloning without this option can be impossible.\n\n-o0 Run script in $OCS_PRERUN_DIR before clone starts\n\nRun the scripts in the directory $OCS_PRERUN_DIR before clone is started. The location of the directory can be determined by editing the file drbl-ocs.conf. By default it is /opt/drbl/share/ocs/prerun.\n\n-o1 Run script in $OCS_POSTRUN_DIR as clone finishes\n\nRun the scripts in the directory $OCS_POSTRUN_DIR when clone is finished. The location of the directory can be determined by editing the file drbl-ocs.conf. By default it is /opt/drbl/share/ocs/postrun. The command will be run before that assigned in -p.\n\nThe scripts will be executed by the program \"run-parts\". run-parts only accepts that the name of the scripts must consist entirely of upper and lower case letters, digits and underscores. So if your file name has an illegal character \".\", run-parts won't run it. You can test which files will be executed by entering the command:\n\nrun-parts --test /opt/drbl/share/ocs/postrun\n\nPartition table [^]\n\nThis option decides what is done to the partition table of the target drive.\n\nUse the partition table from the image\n\nThis option causes Clonezilla Live to copy the partition table from the image. Use this option if you are cloning a whole disk or somehow know that the partition tables are identical (for example, if you are restoring a partition to the same disk where it was copied from and haven't repartitioned the drive after creating the backup). This is the default option.\n\n-k Do NOT create a partition table on the target disk\n\nDo NOT create partition in target harddisk. If this option is set, you must make sure there is an existing partition table in the current restored harddisk.\n\n-k1 Create partition table proportionally (OK for MRB format, not GPT)\n\nCauses Clonezilla Live to create the partition table automatically using sfdisk after restoring the images. This option works nearly always, but sometimes cloned Windows don't boot. Note that this option doesn't work if you have GUID Partition Table on your disk. (Most likely you don't have one.)\n\n-k2 Enter command line prompt to create partition manually later\n\nLike the -k option, this option doesn't create the partition table automatically. However, after restoring the image you are led to command line prompt where you can create the partition table manually. Don't use this option if you don't know how the partition table can be created.\n\n-j0 Use dd to create partition (NOT OK if logical drives exist)\n\nUse dd to dump the partition table from saved image instead of sfdisk.\n\nWe read in DRBL FAQ/Q&A:\n\nWhen I use clonezilla to clone M$ windows, there is no any problem when saving an image from template machine. However, after the image is restored to another machine, it fails to boot, the error message is \"Missing Operating System\". What's going on ?\n\nUsually this is because GNU/Linux and M$ windows interpret the CHS (cylinder, head, sector) value of harddrive differently. Some possible solutions:\n\n1. Maybe you can change the IDE harddrive setting in BIOS, try to use LBA instead of auto mode.\n\n2. Try to choose\n\n[ ] -j0 Use dd to create partition table instead of sfdisk\n\nand\n\n[ ] -t1 Client restores the prebuilt MBR from syslinux (For Windows only)\n\nwhen you restore the image.\n\n3. You can try to boot the machine with MS Windows 9x bootable floppy, and in the DOS command prompt, run: \"fdisk /mbr\". 4. You can try to boot the machine with MS Windows XP installation CD, enter recovery mode (by pressing F10 key in MS XP, for example), then in the console, run \"fixmbr\" to fix it. Maybe another command \"fixboot\" will help, too. For more info, refer to this doc\n\n5. Use ntfsreloc to adjust FS geometry on NTFS partitions. For more info, refer to http://www.linux-ntfs.org/doku.php?id=contrib:ntfsreloc\n\nIt has been confirmed that activating the -j0 option, fixes the problem.\n\nThis option doesn't work if you use LVM (Logical Volume Manager).\n\nexit Exit\n\nThis option ends the restore process and enters command line prompt.\n\nPostaction [^]\n\n-p true Do nothing when the clone finishes\n\n-p reboot Reboot client when the clone finishes\n\n-p poweroff Shutdown client when the clone finishes\n\nWhen image restoration finishes, do one of the following: choose action (default), poweroff or reboot.\n\nSaving image files in NTFS partitions [^]\n\nAlthough not recomended, you may find yourself having to save your image file in a NTFS (Windows XP) partition. You may never have a problem doing this, but you may get a message like the following one, when the partition gets mounted:\n\nVolume is scheduled for check\n\nPlease boot into Windows TWICE, or use 'force' mount option\"\n\nand the backup procedure fails. There are two things you can do here:\n\nExit the program, reboot and use Windows XP Recovery Console to fix the NTFS file system. From Recovery Console prompt, execute the command:\n\nchkdsk /f X:\n\nwhere X: is the drive letter of the disk. When done, boot back into Clonezilla Live and repeat the backup procedure.\n\nIf the disk/partition you are trying to backup is not the Windows System disk (usually C:), you can boot Windows, and execute the command in a DOS window. To open a DOS window click Start / Run... and at the prompt Open: type cmd.\n\nIf the Windows version you use is not XP and you're trying to backup the Windows System drive, boot into SystemRescueCD (graphical mode is not needed) and run the following command:\n\nntfsfix /dev/hda1\n\nwhere /dev/hda1 is the partition name in GNU/Linux. When done, boot back into Clonezilla Live and repeat the backup procedure.\n\nIf Windows XP Recovery Console is not available, you don't have the time to execute the procedure described above, or even if you have executed it but you still get the same message, and you are absolutely sure that you get this message because the NTFS partition is really scheduled for check, and it's not because Windows crushed or have become corrupt, you can mount the patririon by hand and tell Clonezilla Live to use it. Assuming the partition is /dev/hda1, exit the program and execute the commands:\n\nsudo su -\n\nntfs-3g -o force /dev/hda1 /home/partimag\n\nocs-live\n\nand when you get to the screen \"Mount clonezilla image directory\", select\n\nskip Use existing /home/partimag\n\nGetting backups [^]\n\nIn this page I will demonstrate the creation of an image file by getting a backup of a virtual partition (/dev/sdb1). The image file will be saved in another virtual partition (/dev/sda1).\n\nThe first thing you do when you want to get a backup of a disk/partition, is make sure both the souce (to be backed up) and target (to hold the image file) partitions are in excellent condition (error free). This is the logical thing to do, cause I wouldn't want to backup a corrupt partition, or end up with a corrupt image file.\n\nThere is one more step I would want to take: I should check that my BIOS boot settings are correct, in order to boot from my CD/DVD drive.\n\nHaving done all of the above, I am ready to boot from Clonezilla-SysRescCD.\n\nGetting the backup [^]\n\nClonezilla-SysRescCD starting screen [^]\n\nIf you're fine with US keymap and English language (available languages are English, Spanish, French, Italian, Japanese and Chinese [both simplified and traditional]) or don't mind editing the boot parameters, just select Clonezilla Live at the starting screen and press ENTER. When the system comes up, it will load the program that will preform the backup. After that continue from this step.\n\nIf you need to change these settings, select one of the available Clonezilla Live menu entries, and press TAB. The current boot parameters will be displayed.\n\nThe default parameters for booting Clonezilla Live on a 1024x768 screen, are the following:\n\nappend initrd=/live/initrd1.img boot=live union=aufs\n\nocs_live_run=\"ocs-live-general\" ocs_live_extra_param=\"\"\n\nocs_prerun=\"/live/image/restorecd/prerun.normal\" ocs_live_batch=\"no\"\n\nocs_lang=\"en_US.UTF-8\" ocs_live_keymap=\"NONE\" vga=791 nolocales\n\nBy deleting the words in red, you instruct Clonezilla Live to ask you the values of these parameters. When the appropriate changes have been done (as shown bellow), just press ENTER to boot.\n\nappend initrd=/live/initrd1.img boot=live union=aufs\n\nocs_live_run=\"ocs-live-general\" ocs_live_extra_param=\"\"\n\nocs_prerun=\"/live/image/restorecd/prerun.normal\" ocs_live_batch=\"no\"\n\nocs_lang=\"\" ocs_live_keymap=\"\" vga=791 nolocales\n\nScreen \"Choose Language\" [^]\n\nI select \"en_US.UTF-8 English\" and press ENTER.\n\nScreen \"Configuring console-data\" [^]\n\nI select \"Select keymap from full list\" and press ENTER. If you're using US keymap, the default option \"Don't touch keymap\" is a better choice.\n\nScreen \"Configuring console-data\" [^]\n\nAs I (the contributor who wrote a great deal of this page) use Finnish keyboard, I select \"pc / qwerty / Finnish / Standard / Standard\". Because you most likely use a different keyboard, choose the one you use.\n\nScreen \"Start Clonezilla\" [^]\n\nI select \"Start Clonezilla\" and press ENTER.\n\nScreen \"Clonezilla\" [^]\n\nI select \"device-image\" and press ENTER.\n\nScreen \"Mount clonezilla image directory\" [^]\n\nIn this screen I can select the way the image file directory will be saved. Available options are local directory, remote directory through ssh, samba or nfs and skip, to use the previously used directory. More info about the image file can be found at section \"About the Image file\".\n\nI select \"local_dev\" and press ENTER.\n\nNext screen [^]\n\nThis is where I choose the location of the image file. It will be saved at the root directory of the selected partition.\n\nI select partition sda1 and press ENTER.\n\nand then ENTER again.\n\nThis screen displays the mounting result.\n\nAs we can see, /dev/sda1 has been successfully mounted under /tmp/local-dev.\n\nNext Screen [^]\n\nI select Beginer mode to accept the default backup options. If you select Expert mode, you can choose the options yourself. More details can be found here.\n\nScreen \"Select mode\" [^]\n\nHere I can select the desired operation.\n\nI select \"savedisk\" and press ENTER.\n\nNext Screen [^]\n\nIn this screen I select the image name.\n\nI type \"Backup_32-2010_sdb\", which in my opinion is more informative name than the default.\n\nNext Screen [^]\n\nFinally I am asked to select the partition to save.\n\nI just press ENTER again.\n\nStarting the backup [^]\n\nThen the program will display the command that will be executed and will ask me to press ENTER.\n\nThen I will be asked to confirm the operation by pressing y and ENTER.\n\nAfter that, the backup begins\n\nand when it's successfully completed, I press ENTER to get to the shell. Then, I execute the commands:\n\nsudo su -\n\ncd\n\numount -a\n\nreboot\n\nto reboot the system.\n\nGetting backups on Samba [^]\n\nWhat if you don't have a spare local disk or partition or a USB disk? How will you be able to get a backup of your system? Well, if your PC is on the same LAN with another PC running Windows (or linux), you can use Samba to save your image file on that remote PC (which we will call Samba server from now on).\n\nUsing Samba you will be able to mount a Windows share resource (or Samba share resource), from within Clonezilla Live, and save the image file there. Then you can boot that PC using SystemRescueCD and create a restore DVD.\n\nIn this page I will demonstrate the creation of an image file by getting a backup of my second disk (/dev/sdb). The image file will be save in my Samba server which is my laptop (ip: 10.0.0.3, Windows share resource name: all_my_images).\n\nWhat is Samba? [^]\n\nWe read at http://us1.samba.org/samba/:\n\nSamba is an Open Source/Free Software suite that provides seamless file and print services to SMB/CIFS clients. Samba is freely available, unlike other SMB/CIFS implementations, and allows for interoperability between Linux/Unix servers and Windows-based clients.\n\nSamba is software that can be run on a platform other than Microsoft Windows, for example, UNIX, Linux, IBM System 390, OpenVMS, and other operating systems. Samba uses the TCP/IP protocol that is installed on the host server. When correctly configured, it allows that host to interact with a Microsoft Windows client or server as if it is a Windows file and print server.\n\nGathering info [^]\n\nBefore you can use this approach to get a backup, you have to get some info about the Samba server.\n\nThe Samba server I have used for this example was my laptop, so I already knew most of the info required. If this is not the case for you, just ask the owner, user or system admin.\n\nThe info required is:\n\nThe IP address of the Samba server\n\nThe domain on the Samba server\n\nThis may exist if your PC is connected to a larger LAN (a corporation network, for example). In my case this is empty.\n\nThe user name and password you can use\n\nThe directory on the Samba server you can use to save your backup\n\nThis is the name of the Windows share resource (Samba share resource) as it is known in the network, which is not necessarily the same as the local directory name. The user whose account will be used to login to the Samba server, must have write permission to this directory.\n\nGetting the backup [^]\n\nIf you're fine with US keymap and English language (available languages are English, Spanish, French, Italian, Japanese and Chinese [both simplified and traditional]) or don't mind editing the boot parameters, just select Clonezilla Live at the starting screen and press ENTER. When the system comes up, it will load the program that will preform the backup.\n\nIf you need to change these settings, go to the Getting backups page for instructions .\n\nScreen \"Start Clonezilla\" [^]\n\nI select \"Start Clonezilla\" and press ENTER.\n\nScreen \"Clonezilla\" [^]\n\nI select \"device-image\" and press ENTER.\n\nScreen \"Mount clonezilla image directory\" [^]\n\nIn this screen I can select the way the image file directory will be saved. Available options are local directory, remote directory through ssh, samba or nfs and skip, to use the previously used directory. More info about the image file can be found at section \"About the Image file\".\n\nI select \"samba server\" and press ENTER.\n\nScreen \"Mount Samba Server\" [^]\n\nThis is where I have to enter the IP address of my Samba server.\n\nI type \"10.0.0.3\" and press ENTER.\n\nScreen \"Mount Samba Server\" (second time) [^]\n\nThis is where I have to enter the domain name on my Samba server.\n\nI just press ENTER, as there is no domain in my LAN. If there is a domain in your network, you have to type its name (something like my_company.com) and press ENTER.\n\nScreen \"Mount Samba Server\" (third time) [^]\n\nThis is where I have to enter the account (user) name on my Samba server.\n\nI type \"spiros\" and press ENTER.\n\nScreen \"Mount Samba Server\" (fourth time) [^]\n\nThis is where I have to enter the directory name on my Samba server, in which the image file will be saved.\n\nI type \"/all_my_images\" and press ENTER.\n\nAt this point I'm informed I'm going to be asked for the password for user spiros.\n\nI will be able to continue only after entering it correctly.\n\nScreen \"Clonezilla - Opensource Clone System (OCS)\" [^]\n\nI select Beginer mode to accept the default backup options. If you select Expert mode, you can choose the options yourself. More details can be found here.\n\nScreen \"Select mode\" [^]\n\nHere I can select the desired operation.\n\nI select \"savedisk\" and press ENTER.\n\nNext Screen [^]\n\nIn this screen I select the image name.\n\nI type \"Backup_32-2010_sdb\", which in my opinion is more informative name than the default.\n\nNext Screen [^]\n\nFinally I am asked to select the partition to save.\n\nI just press ENTER again.\n\nStarting the backup [^]\n\nThen the program will display the command that will be executed and will ask me to press ENTER.\n\nThen I will be asked to confirm the operation by pressing y and ENTER.\n\nAfter that, the backup begins\n\nand when it's successfully completed, I press ENTER to get to the shell. Then, I execute the commands:\n\nsudo su -\n\ncd\n\numount -a\n\nreboot\n\nto reboot the system.\n\nRestoring data [^]\n\nImage files are always created for one purpose: restoring the data they contain. Images can be, for example, a backup solution: as long as hardware works, the computer can be restored to the state it was when creating the image. Another usage scenario is changing the hard drive: files can be copy-pasted from the old drive to the new, but that method doesn't make the new drive bootable. Disk images do.\n\nThis page contains a demonstration of the latter case. On the Getting backups page, a 500 MB virtual disk containing 160 megabytes of data was copied to a 2 GB virtual disk which was empty. Now the 500 MB disk is changed to an empty 2 GB disk (still virtual) and I'll restore the data to that disk.\n\nWhen creating a disk image, one needs to check that both the source and target partitions are error free. That's not required when the image is restored, because restoration process can't damage the disk image. Note, however, that restoring an image erases all the data in the target disk/partition.\n\nYou also need to check the BIOS settings to be able to boot from Clonezilla-SysRescCD. Some BIOSes contain a boot menu, others require editing settings pernamently. Details can be found on the manual of the motherboard or laptop.\n\nNow let's boot.\n\nRestoring data [^]\n\nClonezilla-SysRescCD starting screen [^]\n\nIf you're fine with US keymap and English language (available languages are English, Spanish, French, Italian, Japanese and Chinese [both simplified and traditional]) or don't mind editing the boot parameters, just select Clonezilla Live at the starting screen and press ENTER. When the system comes up, it will load the program that will preform the backup. After that continue from this step.\n\nIf you need to change these settings, select one of the available Clonezilla Live menu entries, and press TAB. The current boot parameters will be displayed.\n\nThe default parameters for booting Clonezilla Live on a 1024x768 screen, are the following:\n\nappend initrd=/live/initrd1.img boot=live union=aufs\n\nocs_live_run=\"ocs-live-general\" ocs_live_extra_param=\"\"\n\nocs_prerun=\"/live/image/restorecd/prerun.normal\" ocs_live_batch=\"no\"\n\nocs_lang=\"en_US.UTF-8\" ocs_live_keymap=\"NONE\" vga=791 nolocales\n\nBy deleting the words in red, you instruct Clonezilla Live to ask you the values of these parameters.

If you're using US keymap, the default option \"Don't touch keymap\" is a better choice.\n\nScreen \"Configuring console-data\" [^]\n\nBecause I haven't changed my keyboard, I select \"pc / qwerty / Finnish / Standard / Standard\". Because you most likely use a different keyboard, choose the one you use.\n\nScreen \"Start Clonezilla\" [^]\n\nI select \"Start Clonezilla\" and press ENTER.\n\nScreen \"Clonezilla\" [^]\n\nI select \"device-image\" and press ENTER.\n\nScreen \"Mount clonezilla image directory\" [^]\n\nIn this screen I can select the way the image file directory has been saved. Available options are local directory, remote directory through ssh, samba or nfs and skip, to use the previously used directory. More info about the image file can be found at section \"About the Image file\".\n\nI select \"local_dev\" and press ENTER.\n\nNext screen [^]\n\nThis is where I choose the location of the image file.\n\nI select partition sda1 and press ENTER.\n\nand then ENTER again.\n\nThis screen displays the mounting result.\n\nAs we can see, /dev/sda1 has been successfully mounted under /tmp/local-dev.\n\nNext Screen [^]\n\nI select Beginer mode to accept the default restore options. If you select Expert mode, you can choose the options yourself. More details can be found here.\n\nScreen \"Select mode\" [^]\n\nHere I can select the desired operation.\n\nI select \"restoredisk\" and press ENTER.\n\nNext Screen [^]\n\nIn this screen I select the image folder. This partition contains only one image.\n\nNext Screen [^]\n\nFinally I am asked to select which partition the image will be restored to. After double-checking the disk doesn't contain anything important, I press ENTER.\n\nStarting the restoration [^]\n\nThen the program will display the command that will be executed and will ask me to press ENTER.\n\nThen I will be asked to confirm the operation by pressing y and ENTER.\n\nThen my confirmation is asked one last time. After checking one more time the disk doesn't contain any important data, I press y and ENTER.\n\nAfter that, the restore process begins\n\nand when it's successfully completed, I press ENTER to get to the shell. Then, I execute the commands:\n\nsudo su -\n\ncd\n\numount -a\n\nreboot\n\nto reboot the system.\n\nCreating a Restore DVD - Part 1 [^]\n\nAssuming you have used Clonezilla Live to make a backup of your Windows XP system (partition /dev/sda1), you will probably be wondering what to do with it now. Well, one option would be to keep it to the disk you used to save it in, store the disk, and use it whenever you need it. Another option would be to create a DVD you can use to restore this image.\n\nBefore, up to Clonezilla-SysRescCD 2.6.0, the process to create an automated restore DVD required entering command line prompt and writing some commands, that can be uncomfortable or even difficult for many people.\n\nLater, a TUI option to create an automated recovery disc was added to Clonezilla Live, and ocs-iso script included in Clonezilla-SysRescCD 3.1.0 and newer has a TUI too. Old command-line options are no longer supported. This page walks you through the creation of an automated restore DVD via TUI.\n\nYou have to boot Clonezilla Live, using Clonezilla-SysRescCD.\n\nCreating the disk image [^]\n\nClonezilla-SysRescCD starting screen [^]\n\nIf you're fine with US keymap and English language (available languages are English, Spanish, French, Italian, Japanese and Chinese [both simplified and traditional]) or don't mind editing the boot parameters, just select Clonezilla Live at the starting screen and press ENTER. When the system comes up, it will load the program that will preform the backup. After that continue from this step.\n\nIf you need to change these settings, select one of the available Clonezilla Live menu entries, and press TAB. The current boot parameters will be displayed.\n\nThe default parameters for booting Clonezilla Live on a 1024x768 screen, are the following:\n\nappend initrd=/live/initrd1.img boot=live union=aufs\n\nocs_live_run=\"ocs-live-general\" ocs_live_extra_param=\"\"\n\nocs_prerun=\"/live/image/restorecd/prerun.normal\" ocs_live_batch=\"no\"\n\nocs_lang=\"en_US.UTF-8\" ocs_live_keymap=\"NONE\" vga=791 nolocales\n\nBy deleting the words in red, you instruct Clonezilla Live to ask you the values of these parameters. When the appropriate changes have been done (as shown bellow), just press ENTER to boot.\n\nappend initrd=/live/initrd1.img boot=live union=aufs\n\nocs_live_run=\"ocs-live-general\" ocs_live_extra_param=\"\"\n\nocs_prerun=\"/live/image/restorecd/prerun.normal\" ocs_live_batch=\"no\"\n\nocs_lang=\"\" ocs_live_keymap=\"\" vga=791 nolocales\n\nScreen \"Choose Language\" [^]\n\nI select \"en_US.UTF-8 English\" and press ENTER.\n\nScreen \"Configuring console-data\" [^]\n\nI select \"Select keymap from full list\" and press ENTER. If you're using US keymap, the default option \"Don't touch keymap\" is a better choice.\n\nScreen \"Configuring console-data\" [^]\n\nBecause I haven't changed my keyboard, I select \"pc / qwerty / Finnish / Standard / Standard\". Because you most likely use a different keyboard, choose the one you use.\n\nScreen \"Start Clonezilla\" [^]\n\nI select \"Start Clonezilla\" and press ENTER.\n\nScreen \"Clonezilla\" [^]\n\nI select \"device-image\" and press ENTER.\n\nScreen \"Mount clonezilla image directory\" [^]\n\nIn this screen I can select the way the image file directory has been saved. Available options are local directory, remote directory through ssh, samba or nfs and skip, to use the previously used directory. More info about the image file can be found at section \"About the Image file\".\n\nI select \"local_dev\" and press ENTER.\n\nNext screen [^]\n\nThis is where I choose the location of the image file.\n\nI select partition sda1 and press ENTER.\n\nand then ENTER again.\n\nThis screen displays the mounting result.\n\nAs we can see, /dev/sda1 has been successfully mounted under /tmp/local-dev.\n\nNext Screen [^]\n\nI select Beginer mode to accept the default restore options, which are used if the recovery disk is ever used. If you select Expert mode, you can choose the options yourself. More details can be found here.\n\nScreen \"Clonezilla: Select mode\" [^]\n\nHere I can select the desired operation.\n\nI select \"recovery-iso-zip\" and press ENTER.\n\nNext Screen [^]\n\nIn this screen I select the image folder. This partition contains only one image.\n\nNext Screen [^]\n\nNow I am asked to select which disk the image will be restored to, if the recovery disc is used. Because this image is a backup, I choose the same disk where the original data resides. If you're upgrading your hard drive, choose the new drive.\n\nNext Screen [^]\n\nIn this screen I can select the language that the recovery disc uses. I choose \"en_US.UTF-8\".\n\nNext Screen [^]\n\nThis screen allows me to select the keymap that the recovery disc uses. Unfortunately, changing the keymap requires knowing where the keymap file resides in Debian GNU/Linux. Because I don't know it, I just press ENTER to accept US keymap.\n\nNext Screen [^]\n\nI select \"iso\" to create a CD/DVD disk image which I can burn to a recordable CD/DVD disc. The good thing about recordable discs is that overwriting the backup by accident is impossible. The \"zip\" option creates a ZIP file which can be used to create a bootable pendrive or external hard drive.\n\nThen the program will display the command that will be executed and will ask me to press ENTER.\n\nScreen \"Excessive Image Size\" [^]\n\nYou will see this screen if the image file you're about to create is larger than a single layer DVD. The screen warns that mkisofs or genisoimage (the programs which actually create the image) might be unable to process a disk image that big. However, even bigger problem is that you need a dual layer DVD or Blu-ray disc to burn the image.\n\nScreen \"Customization section\" [^]\n\nNow I am asked if I want to customize the boot menu of the disc. I answer \"Yes\". If you don't want to customize the menu, continue from this step.\n\nScreen \"DVD Title\" [^]\n\nIn this screen I select the title of the boot menu. I type \"Home PC Restore DVD\".\n\nScreen \"Menu Items Caption\" [^]\n\nThis screen allows me to select the caption for all menu items. I enter \"Restore Win XP\".\n\nScreen \"Boot delay\" [^]\n\nI press ENTER to accept the default delay of 30 seconds. It means that when a computer is booted from the restore disc, it waits 30 seconds before choosing the default option automatically. You may want to reduce this delay if, for example, your keyboard doesn't work in boot menu and you must wait until the delay ends.\n\nScreen \"Default Boot Item\" [^]\n\nIn this screen I can select the default option of the menu. Selecting one of the options that restore the image makes using the disc even easier, but also raises the risk that the image is restored accidentally. Another reason to select such option may be that your keyboard doesn't work in boot menu, preventing you from choosing any non-default option. I select the first option that restores the image using pixel dimensions of 1024*768.\n\nScreen \"Boot Screen Image\" [^]\n\nThis screen allows me to select the background picture of the menu. Note that the picture must be in the same partition that contains the disk image, if you don't mind entering command line and mounting the right partition manually. I choose picture mysplash.png in the root of the partition. Because the partition has been mounted in /home/partimag, the full path of the picture is /home/partimag/mysplash.png.\n\nScreen \"ISO Label\" [^]\n\nIn this screen I can select the volume label of the disc. Volume label is the name of the disc you may see in various situations, for example in the notification you see when you insert the disc into your DVD writer. I type \"Backup_52-2009_hdb\".\n\nScreen \"Publisher ID\" [^]\n\nThis is where I choose the publisher ID of the ISO file and the disc. Publisher ID means the person or company who created the disc. However, at least in GNU/Linux reading the publisher ID is, strictly speaking, a challenge. Here are instructions to read the publisher ID of a ISO file. I didn't find any working instructions to read the ID from the disc.\n\nStarting the creation of the disk image [^]\n\nAfter that, creation of the disk image begins. Note that no confirmation is asked it the disk image is small enough to fit to a CD.\n\nWhen the disk image is successfully created, I must reboot in order to burn the disc because my DVD burner is still in use. Clonezilla Live can be loaded into computer memory during boot in order to be able to burn disc(s) within it. However, due to a known bug, the disk image can't be created if Clonezilla Live has been loaded into memory. (source) Thus, I press 1 and ENTER to reboot to another operating system and burn the image using graphical burning program. Follow this link for instructions. If you've created a ZIP file, follow this one instead.\n\nWhat to do with the disk image [^]\n\nThe previous page contains partial instructions to create an automated recovery DVD. They're partial because they only tell how the disk image can be created, not what one should do with the image. Of course, partial instructions are not enough, but don't worry - this page is the other part.\n\nEarlier versions of Clonezilla Live allowed creating the DVD without reboot, but it's no longer possible due to a known bug. The disk image can't be created if Clonezilla Live has been loaded into memory (source) and the image can't be burned to disc if Clonezilla Live isn't in memory. And if the computer must be rebooted anyway, it's a good idea to use one's favorite operating system and a graphical burning program for burning the disc. Doing so also allows reading these instructions while burning the disc.\n\nThis page walks through burning the disc by using ImgBurn and K3b. The instructions can be adapted for many other burning programs as well. If your burning program is too different, download either of the programs mentioned - they both can be downloaded for free.\n\nIn addition to a DVD, bootable pendrive or external hard drive can be created as well. If you want to do so, follow instructions below.\n\nBefore following these instructions, insert a writable DVD or Blu-ray disc to your burner.\n\nBurning the disc [^]\n\nUsing ImgBurn [^]\n\nImgBurn is a lightweight but very feature-rich disc burning program. It only requires about two megabytes disk space and contains a lot of settings. ImgBurn is closed-source freeware and - unfortunately - Windows-only software. I (Jyrki) personally use ImgBurn when burning discs within Windows.\n\nLaunch ImgBurn and press Write image file to disc. Select the disk image you just created.\n\nAt the settings window, keep Test Mode disabled. I also recommend keeping the Verify option enabled. Verifying the integrity of the disc after burning requires time and doesn't prevent the disc from becoming a so-called coaster, but it allows you to know immediately if the burning attempt failed, so you can try burning the disc again.\n\nKeep the number of copies as 1 (or increase it, if you really want multiple copies of the disc). Use your best judgment while choosing the burning speed: according to this forum thread lowering the burning speed gives very mixed results in quality. I personally use Â¾ of the maximum speed of the disc, for example 12x on a disc rated 16x.\n\nAfter choosing the settings, press the big picture at the bottom-left of the window. Don't do anything that requires much computer resources while burning, because doing so increases the likelihood of burning failure.\n\nThat's it. You own now an automated recovery disc.\n\nUsing K3b [^]\n\nK3b (KDE Burn Baby Burn) is the disc burning program included in KDE Software Compilation. It comes with most, if not all, KDE-based GNU/Linux distributions. It can also be installed on other distributions, but I recommend against doing so - K3b requires KDE base packages to be installed, and it doesn't make much sense to install KDE base only for K3b.\n\nI launch K3b and navigate to the folder where the disk image resides.\n\nI double-click the file clonezilla-live-Backup_5-2010_hda.iso.\n\nThis window allows me to choose burning settings. I don't touch Image Type or Burn Medium, because they're auto-detected anyway. The maximum burning speed allowed by the disc is 16x, so I choose speed 12x. According to this forum thread low burning speed can decrease burning quality, so I always use speed near the maximum speed of the disc.\n\nI keep Writing Mode as Auto and number of copies as 1. I also keep the Simulate option disabled and enable the Verify written data option. The latter allows me to notice immediately if the burning attempt failed, so I can try burning the disc again, rather than owning a so-called coaster and relying on it if something happens to my data...\n\nI click Start and the burning process begins.\n\nBecause I enabled the Verify written data option, K3b starts verifying the integrity of the disc right after burning.\n\nThe burning attempt succeeded.\n\nHere we can see the boot menu of the disc.\n\nZIP file instructions [^]\n\nOften the image file is way too big to fit to even 8 GB DVD. Some people may also want to be able to overwrite the backup when it becomes outdated. In addition, netbooks don't have optical drives at all.\n\nOne option is using recovery thumb drive or external hard drive instead of DVD. If the external HD is big enough, the disk image can be even over a terabyte in size. Recovery USB drive can also be used on netbooks and overwritten at will.\n\nClonezilla Live allows creating a ZIP file instead of disk image. If you want to do so, follow this step-by-step guide.\n\nBefore creating the disk image, make sure it is split to pieces of four gigabytes or less. It is split automatically if you use Beginner mode, and if you use Expert mode, you should already know how the splitting setting can be changed.\n\nUsing GNU/Linux [^]\n\nAfter creating the disk image and booting into GNU/Linux, make sure that the filesystem of the partition where you plan to put the disk image is FAT32. If you don't know the filesystem, open terminal and run this command as root:\n\nparted -l\n\nNote: How a command can be run as root depends on the GNU/Linux distribution you use. If it's Ubuntu or a distro based on it, simply put \"sudo\" above the command. For example, the above command can be executed by typing \"sudo parted -l\"\n\nNote: The l in parameter -l is lowercase L, not number 1.\n\nIf your disk doesn't contain any FAT32 partition, but it contains a partition which is big enough and doesn't contain any important data, format the partition as FAT32. The command below needs root access too.\n\nmkfs.vfat -F 32 /dev/sdc1\n\nNote: In the command replace /dev/sdc1 with the partition you wish to format.\n\nAfter formatting the partition or noticing that it was already FAT32, extract the ZIP archive to the root of the partition. Also these commands need root rights.\n\nmount /dev/sdc1 /media/usb\n\nunzip clonezilla-live-Backup_5-2010_hdb.zip -d /media/usb/\n\nNote: In the last command I have assumed your image file is clonezilla-live-Backup_5-2010_hdb.zip. You will have to replace this with the actual name of the file.\n\nZIP package contains a script to make the USB drive bootable. Let's run it. The latter of these commands needs root access.\n\ncd /media/usb/utils/linux\n\n./makeboot.sh /dev/sdc1\n\nThat's all. Your thumb drive or external hard drive should be now an automatic recovery disk.\n\nUsing Windows [^]\n\nIf the Windows version you use is not Vista or 7, you need to be logged in as administrator. If you're not, but you have access to an admin account, log out and then log again in as admin.\n\nIf you don't have admin rights at all, boot into SystemRescueCD (you don't need graphical mode this time) and follow the instructions for GNU/Linux. In SystemRescueCD all commands are run as root, so you don't need to add any prefix to the commands.\n\nAfter creating the disk image and booting into Windows, make sure that the filesystem of the partition where you plan to put the disk image is FAT32. If you don't know the filesystem, open My Computer, right-click the partition and select Properties. Then read the \"File system\" column. If there reads anything but FAT32, check other partitions of the disk too, if the disk contains multiple partitions. If you have a suitable FAT32 partition, continue from this step.\n\nIf your disk doesn't contain any FAT32 partition, but it contains a partition which is big enough and doesn't contain any important data, format the partition as FAT32.\n\nRight-click the partition and select Format.... If the Windows version you use is Vista or 7, an UAC prompt asks for admin password. Enter it.\n\nAt the format window, choose the FAT32 filesystem. You can enter any volume label (it means the name of the partition you can see next to the partition letter) and enable Quick Format if you're in a hurry. If Quick Format is disabled, Windows checks if the partition is physically OK after formatting it. Enabling Quick Format makes the formatting process many times faster and, contrary to popular belief, hardly ever causes any harm.\n\nAfter formatting the partition or noticing that it was already FAT32, extract the ZIP archive to the root of the partition. Navigate to the folder where you've saved the ZIP file and right-click it. Choose Extract all..., and when you're asked for location where the archive is extracted, enter the letter of the partition, for example H:\\. Do NOT choose any folder in the partition!\n\nAfter that, browse to the folder X:\\utils\\win32, where X: is the letter of the partition.\n\nThen, double-click makeboot.bat. If the Windows version you use is Vista or 7, another UAC prompt appears. Enter the password again. Then just follow the prompts to make the USB drive bootable.\n\nNow you're done. Your thumb drive or external hard drive should be an automatic recovery disk.\n\nRestoring to a different location [^]\n\nIn the past restoring to a different location was not supported by Clonezilla Live at all. Because of that, a script called reloc-img was added to Clonezilla-SysRescCD, which would help the user perform this task.\n\nRecent versions of Clonezilla Live partly support restoring to a different location, so the reloc-img script is obsolete, and has been removed. Clonezilla Live now supports:\n\nRelocation of a disk image (restoring a whole disk)\n\nRelocation of a partition image (restoring a partition)\n\nClonezilla Live does not support:\n\nRelocation of a single partition contained into a disk image.\n\nImagine you have a disk backup image named hda-2009-02-02. The image contains three partitions, hda1 (operating system), hda2 (user data) and hda3 (other data).\n\nYou want to restore your other data partition (hda3), to a different system (partition sdb2) but there is no way to restore (extract) a single partition from a disk image - you can only restore the whole disk.\n\nIn order to address this situation, two new scripts have been written for Clonezilla-SysRescCD: imginfo and imgconvert\n\nScript imginfo [^]\n\nThe script will be used to print info about existing image files.\n\nIts help screen is:\n\n# imginfo -h\n\nClonezilla Live Image Information\n\nimginfo v. 0.1 - (C) 2009 S. Georgaras <sng@hellug.gr>\n\nUsage: imginfo <options> <directory>\n\nAvailable options:\n\ns Search in sub-directories too\n\ni [name] Pring info for image [name]\n\nv Print version info and exit\n\nh Print this screen and exit\n\nScript imgconvert [^]\n\nThe script will be used to convert an existing disk image file to a new partition image file.\n\nimgconvert can create two type of images:\n\nTemporary image\n\nThis type of image is created by linking the data files of the existing disk image to the new partition image. This means that the original image must be present for the new image to be used. This is the default image type created by imgconvert.\n\nPermanent image\n\nThis type of image is created by copying the data files from the existing disk image to the new partition image. This means that the original image is not needed in order to use the new one. Permenant image files are created using the command line parameter -p.\n\nIts help screen is:\n\n# imgconvert -h\n\nClonezilla Live Image Conversion\n\nimgconvert v. 0.1 - (C) 2009 S. Georgaras <sng@hellug.gr>\n\nUsage: imgconvert <options> [image] [partition] <new partition>\n\nParameters are:\n\n[image] Disk image to be converted to partition image\n\n[partition] Partition name to convert. It must be a valid device name\n\nAvailable options:\n\no [image] Save new imag as [image]\n\np Save new partition instead of making a link to the old one\n\nv Print version info and exit\n\nh Print this screen and exit\n\nUsing the scripts [^]\n\nRestoring to a partition [^]\n\nAfter booting into Clonezilla Live, I select\n\nEnter_shell Enter command line prompt\n\nwhen the menu is displayed and then I press 2 to exit to the shell.\n\nAt this point I will mount my images partition (in this example /dev/sdc4), and use script imginfo to get info about my image files.\n\n$ sudo su -\n\n# mount /dev/sdc4 /home/partimag\n\n# cd /home/partimag\n\n# imginfo\n\nImage files found in: /home/partimag\n\nImage: usb250-img, disk: sda, size: 259MB, parts: 1\n\npart: sda4, size: 247.00MB, type: FAT16\n\nImage: sys-bck, disk: hda, size: 320.0GB, parts: 3\n\npart: hda1, size: 22.36GB, type: Linux\n\npart: hda2, size: 39.06GB, type: Linux\n\npart: hda3, size: 233.87GB, type: Linux\n\nAs you can see there are two disk images under /home/partimag: usb250-img and sys-bck.\n\nsys-bck is a backup of my old system, which had three partitions.
