        "text": "Recently the 2TB Western Digital Blue 3D NAND solid state C drive on my less than year-old HP ENVY 795 – 0050 workstation running Windows 10 version 2009 experienced a catastrophic failure.\n\nFortunately, I had an identical replacement drive in storage and all I thought I needed to do was to replace the non functioning SSD with a new one, use Acronis 2019 to recover the operating system and files from the workstation’s D drive or an external drive, and get back to work.\n\nUnfortunately, after multiple attempts, I could not recover the system using Acronis Rescue Media stored on a USB flash drive.\n\nAs a last resort, I turned to a HP Recovery Kit stored on a USB drive to format the new SSD and return the workstation to its as delivered condition. It worked. After installation the machine booted and was ready to upgrade to Windows 10 Professional and install a series of Windows updates.\n\nAfter completing the Windows update process, I installed Acronis 2019 from a CD and tried to recover my programs, documents, photos, etc. again. Nope, Acronis failed again.\n\nThe next step in the recovery process was to reinstall the programs I use on a regular basis: Microsoft Office 2019 Professional, WordPerfect Office X9 and associated programs, Adobe Acrobat, Dragon NaturallySpeaking Professional, MathWorks, etc. I also recovered Outlook 2019 and Dragon profiles from files I had exported to backup drives independent of the Acronis backups.\n\nI then installed the “non functioning” SSD drive in a NexStar CX external hard drive enclosure and plugged the USB cable into the workstation in hopes that I could at least recover my document files. Once again failure. The drive simply was not readable.\n\nAs a last resort, I downloaded and installed Wondershare Data Recovery. After scanning the damaged SSD drive for just over 16 hours Wondershare “recovered” 1,647,965 files. Unfortunately, I was only able to actually recover a couple of Excel spreadsheets and a bunch of graphic images from the Wondershare’s recovered files.\n\nWhat I did learn after running Wondershare was that our practice of using PCmover Professional to move applications, files, and settings from old to new computers over the decades resulted in the transfer of a huge amount of detritus from a Windows XP machine to a Windows 7 PC, and ultimately to the current Windows 10 HP workstation. We will think twice before using PC Mover again in an attempt to avoid moving a growing number of garbage files from machine to machine.\n\nThe next step in the recovery process was to copy all of the document files from the old Lenovo Windows 7 workstation that I had retired in January 2020 to an external drive and then transfer them to the new HP PC. It worked. Then came the painful effort to track down copies of spreadsheets, documents, presentations, etc. created during 2020 from a variety of places including, but not limited to, cloud storage and email attachments.\n\nIn all, it probably took three days to recover the system and I will have to continue tracking down or recreating “lost” files over time.\n\nOut of curiosity I wondered I could reformat the “damage SSD drive”. It worked. I then ran Western Digital’s Data Lifeguard Diagnostics on the old SSD. It passed with flying colors. That done I thought I would simply clone the workstation’s recovered C drive onto the old SSD and put it away for safekeeping. It worked.\n\nHaving gone through the process of recovering a C drive with document files dating back as far as the mid-nineteen eighties I began to wonder if it would be smarter to simply periodically clone a computer’s C drive onto an external drive and then copy the machines document files onto the D drive and/or an external drive on a periodic basis for safe keeping.\n\nUsing the cloning/copying approach, I would not have to go through the uncertainty of using recovery software such as Acronis in the future.\n\nI have been using an internal SSD for the System drive [OS and SW only], a second cloned bootable 2.5 inch SSD, and a physically separate internal Data drive. Most of the systems I build and support are desktops with an ICYDOC in the front bay that can mount a 2.5 inch and a 3.5 inch directly to the motherboard SATA ports without any interfering electronics.\n\nIf I need to restore the internal system SSD, I put the backup SSD into the ICYDOC 2.5 inch slot, boot to it, migrate it back to the internal SSD, then do updates, install any new SW, settings [most of which I have screenshots of], and try to remember to activate GoodSync since their licensing is tied to the physical drive. Once the internal is all caught up to date, I migrate it to the backup SSD that I remove to storage.\n\nIn most cases, I backup the data daily to a NAS using GoodSync, and I occasionally clone the System SSD using MiniTool Partition Wizard 11. I am not a fan of incremental backups. A GoodSync data backup looks exactly like the data drive folders and files, and it can do versioning with various settings. It can also be set it and forget it.\n\nI have only two clients that used Acronis and both have failed to restore a system successfully. After experiencing my routines, one client dropped Acronis, and the other is still enamored with it, but at least his data is also backed up to his NAS with GoodSync.\n\nWhen MiniTool came out with version 12 of Partition Wizard, they moved to an expensive subscription model to unlock the System Migration, so it is good to hear about Casper. I will check it out.\n\nFirst, Macrium Reflect IS a CLONING program, I use it for just that. Tedious, works well. It is not JUST for imaging.\n\nI am from the cloning camp. Mostly use free Aomei Backupper, has served me WELL. It is forgiving when cloning from a less than perfect drive. Clone once a month to a second internal drive {desktop computer} as well as a USB drive.\n\nI find that when a clone fails to complete, running CHKDSK on the source drive can many times help.\n\nI use Karen’s Replicator {free} to back up my files daily to the second internal drive as well as two USB drives. I find Karen’s Replicator the best folder / file backup there is. Authors are responsive to questions and improvements.\n\nAcronis True Image no longer gets my money. Way too picky for a PERFECT source drive. Like Norton Security, wants to “own” your drive and hogs plenty of resources. Been using Acronis True image for nearly 20 years and gave up. Disappointing. Except for a one time installation to the C: drive, I only used it by booting to its CD and running it from there. Better results.\n\nAs for Imaging, my personal opinions / feelings here: too much of a hassle: not readily understandable by customers, has to be “mounted” to see any files for recovery and always needing the SAME program available to use the compressed image for any reason. Possibly, needing the same version of the program that created the image rather than a newer version of the program.\n\nCloning is “one and done”. Not too much of a hassle to test the clone, depending on the computer. On mine, a Dell desktop, I can switch the boot drive in BIOS to test the clone {it is MBR not UEFI}.\n\nIn both cases, Cloning and Imaging, a second drive is needed. To test an image fully, a third drive is needed.\n\nFiles on a cloned drive are readily available, requiring no special software.\n\nI keep up-to-date copies of my data and all downloaded files installed and backed up at my office {away from my home}.\n\nI use web based Gmail for e-mail. Works for me.\n\nIt is not my intention to get into a Clone versus Imaging debate. It is whatever works for you that makes you comfortable. I understand that imaging allows you to image several computers on ONE hard drive and that is convenient. On the backside, if that drives fails so, too, does the images for several computers.\n\nThat issue that bothers me the most is that for 99% of my customers, they NEVER think about backing up or they simply feel the computer is automatically doing it for them! This is a case of being ignorant is truly blind. They fail to understand no device on the planet will last forever, why would they believe that a computer would?\n\nI have been into personal computers and mainframes since 1987. Worked on a ten member team deploying, setting up and repairing computers in all of the northeast states. It was a great job and learning experience. Made some good friends, especially with those smarter than myself!\n\nI am late to this subject and have no clue about backups working or not working because I don’t really use backups as they are described in this thread. Although, I am thinking about that now but in any case, I will continue my processes as I’m about to describe.\n\nMy method works for me. Since I don’t build or even try to repair my computers when they fail, what I do is keep identical copies of all my data files on 5 external drives plus on all 5 of my computers. If I make a change to any data file I immediately copy it to all the devices I just mentioned. I do not back up any program I can reinstall using any method available, unless you consider keeping a copy of that program’s installation a backup. I clean up and compress my Outlook pst files on at least a weekly basis and then copy that pst file to all the previously mentioned devices. That way I never lose much, if anything, from Outlook either.\n\nOnce I have the computer back from the shop with a new drive installed, I go about the process of installing all my programs. It may be time consuming but it also lets me decide on a one to one basis if I need or even want a particular program any more. At most it may take me 12 to 16 hours. But since I’m retired I don’t mind the time it takes. Once all the programs are reinstalled it is just a matter of copying all the data files from either my external drives or any of the network computers back to the correct folders on the repaired computer. That doesn’t really take too long and then I’m back in business.\n\nI know this method is not for everyone but it serves me well and I don’t have to worry about a system backup working or not working.\n\nI have used Acronis without problems on my old Windows 7 PCs. Little bit worried now with the new Windows 10 PC with Acronis 2020 on it. I have not had to recover anything with it so no bad or good experiences to share yet.\n\nI have used Acronis to single backup the C disk that has only Windows and program files. Thus the backup file is not wery big, only about 45 GB. I have stored the backup files to external drives too so I have several earlier backups to try in case the latest backups turns out to be corrupt.\n\nAll other files I have on other disks of the desktop that I backup regularly. I may be a bit old school, but I use Robocopy of DOS to do the backup to external disk with the help of self made BAT files. Robocopy just copies the changes so it usually is quite fast after the first copy. In order to be sure the files that I am backing up and that I have backed up are OK, I have used Fastsum program to calculate and verify the md5 checksums of the files.\n\nJust in case somebody is interested in my bat files, here are the listings. You can use for example notepad to edit and save these:\n\nThe backup.bat listing first:\n\n@echo off\n\nif not exist D:\\My_Files goto :NOTFOUND\n\n@echo.\n\n@echo First the backup source and destination will be compared and a raport will\n\n@echo be shown about what would be the result of the backup. That is,\n\n@echo which files and folders in the destination will be deleted, replaced etc.\n\n@echo.\n\n@echo The result of the backup is that the destination will be exactly like the\n\n@echo source was when the backup started\n\n@echo.\n\n@echo Then it is asked whether the backup operation is OK to be made\n\n@echo.\n\n@echo D disk My_Files to G disk – checking\n\n@echo It will take some time to go through all the files…. please wait…\n\nrobocopy D:\\My_Files G:\\My_Files /MIR /ZB /R:3 /V /FP /LOG:D:\\sync.log /L\n\nrem start/wait notepad D:\\sync.log\n\nCALL SEARCHCHANGE\n\n@echo

three bat files for example in the folder D:\\Backup_BATs. To run these in DOS cmd window it is convenient to have a shortcut to cmd.exe in that folder too. As the place where you want to open your command prompt is on a different folder than the default you need to put an additional command in the Target field in shortcut tab, in this case:\n\nC:\\Windows\\System32\\cmd.exe /k “D: & cd D:\\Backup_BATs\\”\n\nIt will change to the drive D: from the current drive, and than open the D:\\Backup_BATs folder. The & operator is used to put multiple commands in a single line at the windows command prompt.\n\nFurther, click in the shortcut’s Advanced button menu that this is run as an administrator.\n\nNaturally my backup method is not the most foolproof one as you have to be extra careful when you edit the bat file for example to change the folder you want to back up. And the limited character set requires extra measures if the BAT targets to a folder having spaces or letters like äö in its name. Thus most convenient is to put all your folders and files you want to backup to a folder that has simple name such as My_Files\n\nI failed log on in my first post on this issue.\n\nYes I use FSS CASPER , has never failed with a recovery.\n\nNow, I took to heart the super experts options and comments about the main drive ‘ID” in the registry. I admit I failed to understand that. Stated the CLONED drive would not function in WIN due to the hard link of the master drive ID would not match the ID of the cloned drive.\n\nReported Mini Tool Partiton SW had this problem resolved. I have that SW but have not tried to clone.\n\nI did not contact Casper. I have always been able to swap the cloned drive for the master drive and boot to windows. Today I ran a better test , I booted the clone and ran many programs, all functioned with no issue. I ‘trust’ ‘assume’ CASPER has resolved the alleged issue with this drive ID. I might take the time to ask them\n\nCan someone point to the data in the registry entry with the boot drive ID or is it in the MBR? Its not a real problem for me, just interested.\n\nI clone my master boot drive 2 to 3 times a week, and clone the secondary drive (data)once a week. The price of SSD is makes this low cost and fast. I keep 2 to 3 iterations of the boot drive.\n\nDay data backup with Cobian are on a USB thumb drive. Functions perfect a nice program.\n\nBeen a nice discussion, good information.\n\nThis discussion, so far, has been assuming that the OS does not come with a built-in tool to restore a whole HD or SSD, or at least all of one’s data from a recent back up in an external drive, in case of drive failure or a ransomware attack. Also this discussion has been, I believe, only about cases where Windows 10 is the OS. But there is no reason why other OS and their protective measures cannot be mentioned as well, as this topic is of interest to everyone, non-Windows users paying AskWoody subscribers, for example, YT included.\n\nBesides, much of the following is just common sense and applicable to Windows too.\n\nSo Mac users like me, if they don’t already know it, be informed that:\n\n(1) Ransomware attacks against Macs do happen.\n\n(2) That the backup software that comes with macOS is a lifesaver one can use in a dire situation: SSD or HD failure, corruption, or ransomware attack:\n\nhttps://macmyths.com/mac-viruses-time-machine/\n\nA good, real-time anti virus adds a good layer of protection:\n\nhttps://www.macworld.com/article/231118/best-antivirus-for-mac.html (I use “Intego”, a real-time AV recommended by Nathan Parker.)\n\nFinally, one can clone the internal drive using an utility such as Carbon Copy Clone:\n\nhttps://9to5mac.com/2021/05/19/carbon-copy-cloner-for-mac-overhauled/\n\nIn near 30 years of using PCs of my own, I’ve never bothered to clone or make compressed images of my main drive. Because I’m too lazy and, or like to live dangerously? Maybe. I’ve used restore points with Windows and backing up my date to external HDs until moving completely to a Mac in January 2020, since then keeping my files backed up to a dedicated external drive with the Time Machine (TM) utility that comes with macOS.\n\nEven so, there can be a problem in case of a real Ransomware attack (not a scam one, meant to scare people into paying for a non-existent problem), in particular one that locks one out of the Mac. In that case, if one can, one could try to log into the Mac in Recovery Mode:\n\nhttps://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201255 (Note: the “firmware password”, mentioned here, is one the user, optionally, may set up, or not.)\n\nOr else in Safe Mode:\n\nhttps://www.macworld.co.uk/how-to/how-use-mac-safe-mode-3623521/\n\nThen one could choose, among other options, to re-install macOS and then reinstall and run the AV to search and destroy the ransomware installed in the internal drive and then bring back one’s data from their external back-up made with Time Machine. Hoping the last back up was made before the infection, otherwise the ransomware is likely to be also in TM. So scanning the TM drive and taking care of detected infected files with the AV is recommended — or not, deleting the suspect to be infected files from TM instead, based on their post-infection backup date (if one has a good idea of when the infection took place …) — depending on whom you ask. And then one would need to re-install various applications, for that being useful to keep the product keys somewhere outside the computer.\n\nA last resort would be to remove the compromised internal HDD or SSD and replace it with a new one, install macOS in it, then copy one’s data kept in an external backup disk. Or take the computer to an Apple certified shop to have this done by people who, presumably, know how to do it.\n\nA real hassle? Definitely. And not for free. But better than paying a ransom to some crooks that will benefit from it and may not even bother to give one the de-encryption key when they cash one’s money …\n\nFor more information:\n\nhttps://www.macworld.com/article/231118/best-antivirus-for-mac.html (I use Intego.)\n\nhttps://ransomware.org/\n\nAny informed opinions, including some to the contrary, shall be appreciated. If any given, then thanks for that in advance."
