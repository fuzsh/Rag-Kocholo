Linux and MacOS systems will have a suitable Perl already installed. Perl is available for Windows, but is not actively supported by InterMine.\n\nTo set up your Perl environment, perlbrew is a good guide, and make use of the modern toolchain, like cpan.\n\nAt various times, you will be requested to install various Perl modules. Here, you can find instructions for how to do this using the native CPAN tool which comes with every Perl distribution on Linux and OSX, using Debian/Ubuntu package managers, as well as manual installs:\n\nCPAN#\n\nCPAN stands for the Comprehensive Perl Archive Network and it is the software repository for Perl modules (you can compare it to python's pypi, Yum/Apt repositories in Linux, or Apple's App Store). If you have Perl installed, you have CPAN. To check, type cpan in a terminal.\n\nTo install modules with CPAN you may first need to set up the installer, in a terminal run:\n\nThis will take you to a CPAN shell, which will allow you to configure your properties. To review your current configuration, type:\n\nWhen you first run CPAN should run:\n\nThis will guide you through the set-up procedure. You can run this later to change the settings which are set automatically.\n\nTo change a setting manually, type:\n\nFor example, to make installed modules uninstall previous versions and use sudo to elevate permissions (very good ideas), type:\n\nIf you change options, remember to save your changes with:\n\nTo install modules, type:\n\nTo force the install for any reason, use the \"-f\" flag, so type:\n\nIf you have not set the sudo option in the CPAN configuration, Add sudo before the CPAN command, like:\n\nDEB Packages#\n\nMany Perl libraries are packaged for different Linux distributions. Debian/Ubuntu has a great number of these, and in many cases this is a good alternative to the CPAN install.\n\nThe procedure to install is the same as for any other package:\n\nThere is a predictable name to package mapping: \"::\" becomes \"-\", there will be a \"lib\" on the front, and a \"-perl\" on the end, so:\n\n\"XML::DOM\" becomes \"libxml-dom-perl\"\n\n\"Moose\" becomes \"libmoose-perl\"\n\nand so on\n\nThese are the modules you need to build a database:\n\nTo search for a package, you can type:\n\nManually installing InterMine modules#\n\nThe InterMine Perl modules are available on CPAN, and you are encouraged to download them from there. However, you can install them manually too. First you will need to check-out the source code. (It is recommended you update your version of Module::Build to at least version 0.36, as this will allow you to automate the dependency installation.)\n\nFrom your check out (or unzipped tar file) go to the directory \"intermine/perl/\"\n\nHere, there are three \"distributions\" of modules you may want to install:\n\nInterMine-Model\n\nInterMine-Item (depends on InterMine::Model)\n\nWebservice-InterMine (depends on InterMine::Model)\n\nThe installation procedure for these is the same:\n\nIf you do not have Module::Build 0.36 or above, you can install the dependencies using the above methods (CPAN and Packages).\n\nList of Perl Modules to Install#\n\nFor the InterMine modules:\n\nList::MoreUtils (utility functions for handling lists)\n\nLWP (Handling network communication)\n\nModule::Find (Automatically locating modules by name)\n\nMoose (Object system)\n\nMooseX::Role::WithOverloading (Allows roles to overload operators)\n\nMooseX::Types (Type constraint system)\n\nText::CSV_XS (Processing .csv and .tsv files)\n\nURI (Handling URLs)\n\nXML::Parser::PerlSAX (Parsing XML)\n\nXML::DOM (XML processing and output)\n\nText::Glob (used by the project_build script)\n\nFor the download scripts:\n\nLog::Handler\n\nDateTime\n\nModule::Find\n\nWeb::Scraper\n\nOuch\n\nNumber::Format\n\nPerlIO::gzip\n\nPerl6::Junction\n\nFor generating InterMine Items XML:\n\nGetopt::Std\n\nLog::Handler;\n\nDigest::MD5\n\nHow to install all the Perl Modules to Run the Data Downloader Script#\n\nIn order to download all the Perl scripts required by the Data Downloader script, use the following cpan installation command:"
