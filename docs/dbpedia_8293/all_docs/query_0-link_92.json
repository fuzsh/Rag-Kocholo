        "text": "the Clonezilla Live CD Original author(s) Steven Shiau Developer(s) NCHC Free Software Labs Stable release 1.2.9-19[1] / July 26, 2011; 3 months ago ( ) Development status Current Written in Perl, Unix shell Operating system POSIX, GNU/Linux Available in English, Chinese (Traditional) Type Disk cloning, Disaster recovery License GNU General Public License Website clonezilla.org\n\nClonezilla is a free disaster recovery, disk cloning, disk imaging and deployment solution.[2] Clonezilla is designed by Steven Shiau and developed by the NCHC Free Software Labs in Taiwan.[3] Clonezilla SE provides multicast support similar to Norton Ghost Corporate Edition.\n\nContents\n\n1 Clonezilla Live\n\n2 Clonezilla Server\n\n3 See also\n\n4 References\n\n5 External links\n\nClonezilla Live\n\n'Clonezilla Live' enables a user to clone a single computer's storage media, or a single partition on the media, to a separate medium device. The cloned data can be saved as an image-file or as a duplicated copy of the data. The data can be saved to locally attached storage device, an SSH server, a Samba Server, or an NFS file-share. The clone file can then be used to restore the original when needed.\n\nThe Clonezilla application can be run from a USB flash drive, a CD-ROM, or a DVD-ROM. Clonezilla requires no modification to the computer; the software runs in its own booted environment.\n\nClonezilla Server\n\nClonezilla Server is used to clone many computers simultaneously across a network. This is done using a DRBL server and computer workstations that can boot from a network.\n\nSee also\n\nList of disk cloning software\n\nReferences"
