        "text": "I can only speak for Debian. The two programs are called\n\n/usr/bin/rename.ul from the util-linux package (hence the .ul suffix)\n\n/usr/bin/prename from the perl package\n\nThe actual rename command works via the /etc/alternatives mechanism, whereby\n\n/usr/bin/rename is a symlink to /etc/alternatives/rename\n\n/etc/alternatives/rename is a symlink to /usr/bin/prename\n\nThe same problem has been bugging me on Cygwin, which is a Red Hat product, so should be more similar to Fedora. I'll have a look on my company laptop on Monday. And I remember the Perl-rename having worked there sometimes. Probably before I installed util-linux.\n\nIf you install the Perl-rename to /usr/local/bin it will have precedence over rename from util-linux. Same goes for the manpage when installed to /usr/local/share/man/man1/.\n\nI've just created a separate Perl-rename package on Github: https://github.com/subogero/rename\n\nYou can install it using cpan, which is the perl repository similar to pip for python.\n\nHere is a tutorial on using cpan.\n\nIf you try to run rename it it looks like this\n\nrename --help\n\ncall: rename from to files...\n\nTo install the perl rename you can do the following. You might need to install a few dependencies, you can generally just push enter\n\ncpan\n\ncpan1> install File::Rename\n\nCPAN: Storable loaded ok (v2.20)\n\nGoing to read '/root/.cpan/Metadata'\n\nDatabase was generated on Wed, 30 Sep 2015 08:17:02 GMT\n\nRunning install for module 'File::Rename'\n\n....\n\nRunning Build install\n\nInstalling /usr/local/share/man/man1/rename.1\n\nInstalling /usr/local/share/perl5/File/Rename.pm\n\nInstalling /usr/local/share/man/man3/File::Rename.3pm\n\nInstalling /usr/local/bin/rename\n\nWriting /usr/local/lib64/perl5/auto/File/Rename/.packlist\n\nRMBARKER/File-Rename-0.20.tar.gz\n\n./Build install -- OK\n\nThat is how you would install the rename from cpan.\n\nNext is to get it working on your system. As you might have more then one rename installed.\n\nwhich rename /usr/bin/rename\n\nWhen you actually want this one.\n\n/usr/local/bin/rename --help Usage: rename [ -h|-m|-V ] [ -v ] [ -n ] [ -f ] [ -e|-E *perlexpr*]*|*perlexpr* [ *files* ] Options: -v, -verbose Verbose: print names of files successfully renamed. -n, -nono No action: print names of files to be renamed, but don't rename. -f, -force Over write: allow existing files to be over-written. -h, -help Help: print SYNOPSIS and OPTIONS. -m, -man Manual: print manual page. -V, -version Version: show version number. -e Expression: code to act on files name. May be repeated to build up code (like \"perl -e\"). If no -e, the first argument is used as code. -E Statement: code to act on files name, as -e but terminated by ';'.\n\nI just put it into /usr/bin/ but with a slight different name to make sure I did not break any existing scripts / programs the depend on the old one.\n\nln -s /usr/local/bin/rename /usr/bin/rename.pl\n\nOn RedHat 8.4 (but may work on Fedora)\n\nsudo yum install perl-CPAN sudo cpan install module::Build install File::Rename\n\nthan you can create an alias:\n\nalias prename='/usr/local/bin/rename'\n\nAn example:\n\ntouch pic.jpeg prename 's/\\.jpeg$/.jpg/' *.jpeg\n\nHere you create an empty file with the .jpeg extension. The next line renames all the files with .jpeg extension in the current directory: it removes the e from the jpeg extension of these files. (The first line is there to be sure that there is at least one file like that in the directory.)\n\n(On Debian/Ubuntu you can install the rename package, then you'll have the rename command same as the prename above. Also read SzG's answer about alternatives and symbolic links: it may or may not be as simple as I wrote.\n\nAlternatively you need to install the libpath-tiny-perl package to install CPAN.)"
