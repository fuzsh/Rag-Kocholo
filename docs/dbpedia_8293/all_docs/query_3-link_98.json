We're going to be creating a simple configuration to run Perl with warnings enable, so enter perl -w\n\nIn the Location field, we will point Eclipse to use the command shell. By using the command shell instead of the perl executable, we can change directories and run anything we need to prior to actually running the perl script in question. The location of cmd.exe will vary depending on which MS OS you're using. I'm running XP Pro, so I entered C:\\WINDOWS\\system32\\cmd.exe.\n\nIn the Working Directory box, I pointed it to C:\\WINDOWS\\system32, the same location as cmd.exe. There is probably no reason to do so, but what the hell. It can't hurt right?\n\nNow for the magic. In the Arguments box I entered the following\n\n/C \"cd ${container_loc} && perl -w ${resource_name}\"\n\nWhat is all that junk anyhow? Here's a breakdown.\n\n[cmd.exe] /C\n\nCarries out the command specified by string and then terminates\n\ncd ${container_loc}\n\nChange directory to the directory containing the currently selected perl script in the IDE\n\nperl -w ${resource_name}\n\nRun the selected perl script using perl.exe with warnings turned on\n\nNote: I used perl instead of wperl because I'm running the 1.4.x runtime. If I use wperl instead, I actually get the quick DOS popup window even though wperl is modeless , Run in background is checked, and the 1.4.x runtime supposedly fixed this issue (EPIC FAQ Entry). I suspect the opposite would happen if I were using the 1.3.x runtime.\n\nAfter entering the data above, click Apply. You should end up with something looking like Figure 4."
