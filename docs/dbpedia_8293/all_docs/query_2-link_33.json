        "text": "After four years with Arch Linux in my workstation computer, I switched back to Ubuntu desktop (for one more time).\n\nArch Linux is an amazing rock solid Linux distribution and it offers the best documentation by far. However, I moved to Ubuntu 16.04 LTS (Long Term Support) mainly for these reasons:\n\nI want to spend less time to manage my workstation computer (updates are “pain” in Arch, but very easy in Debian/Ubuntu).\n\nI have transferred ALL MY DATA to cloud during last 12 months (basically in Google Drive). I am working many hours with Android in mobile devices, so my desktop workstation can have a more simple setup.\n\nI have transferred ALL MY SERVER APPLICATIONS (apache, php, mysql, postgres) to a Debian VPS, so my desktop workstation can have a more simple setup.\n\nHere is my workstation computer hardware configuration:\n\nMotherboard GIGABYTE Z68AP-D3, socket 1155, DDR3\n\nCPU Intel I7 INTEL CPU Core i7-2700K, BX80623I72700K\n\nRAM (16 GB) KINGSTON KHX1600C9AD3B1/4G, HyperX Blu DDR3, 1600MHz x 4\n\nDisplay adapter NVIDIA ASUS ENGTX550 TI DC/DI/1GD5, 1024MB, GDDR\n\nSSD INTEL 540S SERIES SSDSC2KW240H6X1 240GB 2.5” SATA3 TLC SINGLE PACK (S.M.A.R.T. enabled)\n\nLG W2453SQ 24 LCD Monitor (1920 x 1080)\n\nUPS APC Back UPS BR1500GI RS 1500VA (LI)\n\nUbuntu desktop seems to be much more mature and stable in version 16.04 (latest LTS version). The final result is a Free and Open Source workstation environment, which can meet the requirements of the vast majority of users.\n\nSoftware installation in Ubuntu can be performed using command line\n\nsudo apt-get install package_name\n\nor using graphic utilities (“Synaptic” or “Software center”). See details in this post. In this tutorial I use the first method.\n\nMy goal is to create a Simple And Functional Linux Desktop.\n\nREMARKS\n\nyou will not find information on setup server applications like apache, php, mysql etc in this article. If you are interested on this software, please see this post.\n\nin this article I also describe the software I use for software development. If you are not interested on this kind of software, please skip relevant sections.\n\nBasic setup\n\nUbuntu desktop setup is a simple graphical procedure. Download Ubuntu desktop here. Insert the CD (or the USB) and follow the instructions. Setup will only ask for your name and password and disk partitioning. Everything else is a graphical “wizard”.\n\nMain system user\n\nUsername and password you provide during default setup will be used to create the main user of your system. This user will be automatically added to sudoers group (users with “administration privileges”).\n\nBy default, the root account password is locked in Ubuntu. So, to execute admin tasks you have to use sudo. For example:\n\nsudo apt-get install package_name\n\nDisk Partitions\n\nYou may let Ubuntu to decide for your disk(s) partitioning or to define it manually, as in my case.\n\nI use ext4 file system for system and data partitions.\n\nMy computer has one SSD disk 240 GB, so I used the following structure.\n\nThe first partition I defined is the /boot partition (mount point /boot) and the second is the root partition (mount point /). It is strongly recommended to define a swap partition. As a rule of thumb set the double size of your computer RAM. It is recommended (but not required) to have a separate boot partition.\n\nThese three partitions are dedicated to Operating System files. So, I have defined one more partition, just to write data. This is the data partition (mount point /data). The obvious advantage of having a data partition is you can format the system partitions and install a new Operating System without affecting your data.\n\nAfter completing the Basic setup\n\nWhen setup finishes, you have a working system, covering all of your basic needs.\n\nThe default graphical enviroment of Ubuntu is called Unity. It looks like Gnome, but created by Canonical (the company behind Ubuntu) specifically for Ubuntu. You can also install other desktop environments (eg KDE or XFCE etc). DO NOT DO IT! (imho). If you want another environment, install a different Ubuntu flavor (there are many), eg Kubuntu, Xubuntu etc. Do not make major changes in Ubuntu, if you want a stable and easily upgradeable desktop environment (imho always).\n\nYou will not find a START MENU in Ubuntu Unity, as in many other graphical environments (Linux or Microsoft Windows).\n\nSome applications shortcuts are already in the Unity Launcher (the button bar in the left of the desktop).\n\nYou can launch any application using Ubuntu Unity Dash (see image). Open Dash (click the top button of the Launcher or press SUPER key) and type some letters of the name of the application. For example, to open a terminal:\n\nYou can move application shortcuts from the Dash to Launcher (drag and drop). You can “Unlock” an application from the Launcher using “Right Click → Unlock from Launcher”.\n\nThe HUD or Heads Up Display is a search-based alternative to traditional menus. To open the HUD tap ALT. With HUD you can directly select a menu option of the running application without navigating to menu hierarchy, something like a “Command Palette”.\n\nPress and Hold the “SUPER” key to display Useful keyboard shortcuts.\n\nExample:\n\nSUPER → to open the Dash\n\nCTRL+ALT+T → to open the Terminal\n\nMany applications are preinstalled in Ubuntu. Some of them are:\n\nNautilus file manager\n\nGnome Terminal\n\nFirefox web browser\n\nGedit text editor\n\nLibreOffice (office suite)\n\nGnome Image Viewer\n\nGnome Screenshot\n\nYou can find documentation at help.ubuntu.com. And of course, always remember, Google is your “friend”.\n\nNext steps\n\nNext steps include:\n\nUpdate System\n\nTweak SSD drive\n\nTweak Command Line Environment\n\nInstall more Command Line applications\n\nProgramming Languages\n\nTweak Desktop Graphical Environment\n\nInstall more Graphical applications\n\nInstall Web Development software\n\nSetup peripherals\n\nCloud integration\n\nRecovery mode\n\nBackup your workstation\n\nUpdate System\n\nThe first thing you have to do after Basic setup is to update your system.\n\nUsing the Dash launch “Software updater” (recommended)\n\nor open a terminal and type\n\nsudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get -V upgrade\n\nTweak SSD drive\n\nUbuntu 16.04 seems to be ready for SSD drives. There are some steps you should take to extend the life of your SSD drive. The keypoint is to reduce write actions. Read this post for details.\n\nTweak Command Line Environment\n\nThis section is optional.\n\nBase system includes a lot of command line tools (GNU or other). To run these programs, first launch a Terminal. The most important command line tools are:\n\nText editors: nano (which I use in this tutorial) and the famous vi editor\n\nThe Debian package manager apt\n\ncp (copy), mv (move – rename), rm (delete) files\n\nls list files\n\nArchiving utility tar\n\nCompression utility gzip\n\nRemote operations utilities (OpenSSH project) like ssh, scp, and sftp.\n\nDownload utility wget\n\nFile search utility locate\n\nSet default text editor\n\nnano in my case:\n\nsudo update-alternatives --config editor\n\nresult:\n\nThere are 5 choices for the alternative editor (providing /usr/bin/editor). Selection Path Priority Status ------------------------------------------------------------ 0 /usr/bin/vim.gnome 60 auto mode 1 /bin/ed -100 manual mode * 2 /bin/nano 40 manual mode 3 /usr/bin/mcedit 25 manual mode 4 /usr/bin/vim.gnome 60 manual mode 5 /usr/bin/vim.tiny 10 manual mode Press <enter> to keep the current choice[*], or type selection number:\n\nCustomize nano editor\n\nWith your favorite text editor (nano in my case), edit the configuration file:\n\nsudo nano /etc/nanorc\n\nShow line numbers\n\nFind #set constantshow and uncomment this line\n\n... set constantshow ## (The old form, 'const', is deprecated.) ...\n\nSet tab size\n\n... set tabsize 4 ...\n\nUse SSH key authentication\n\nTo connect to a remote computer using SSH, you have to give a command like:\n\nssh RemoteHost -l username\n\nThen you will be prompted for the password. If you do not want to type the password each time you want to connect, you may use “SSH key authentication”, which is more secure method.\n\nCreate your keys:\n\nssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -C \"youremail\"\n\n(Remember to use a strong passphrase)\n\nThen copy your public key to RemoteServer\n\nssh-copy-id -i ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub RemoteServer\n\nSince then, every time you connect using ssh, you will not be asked for a password. The first time (only) you will be asked for the passphrase.\n\nSSH autocompletion\n\nSSH autocompletion is very useful but Ubuntu sets by default HashKnownHosts yes in /etc/ssh/ssh_config. Set to HashKnownHosts no\n\nInstall more Command Line applications\n\nThis section is optional.\n\nNtp (Network Time Protocol)\n\nInstalling ntp your computer clock can be synchronized with time servers. On Ubuntu, this is done by synchronizing with ntpdate tool.\n\nSo, there is no need to install ntp on Ubuntu. However, if you want to install it:\n\nsudo apt-get install ntp\n\nMidnight Commander (mc)\n\nMidnight Commander is a powerful file manager (local, remote and cloud files). Probably the most popular command line file manager in Linux world.\n\nsudo apt-get install mc\n\nhtop\n\nhtop is an interactive process viewer for Unix.\n\nsudo apt-get install htop\n\niftop\n\nYou can use iftop to display bandwidth usage on an interface.\n\nsudo apt-get install iftop\n\nOpenssh-server\n\nIf you want to be connected with your workstation from command line using ssh (e.g. from another computer in your LAN), install:\n\nsudo apt-get install openssh-server\n\nExamples\n\nSecure Connect to your computer remotely:\n\nssh xxx.xxx.x.x -l username (xxx.xxx.x.x is the IP address)\n\nSecure Copy a file remotely:\n\nscp username@xxx.xxx.x.x:/path/to/remote /path/to/local\n\nHarden SSH\n\nEdit SSH configuration:\n\nsudo nano /etc/ssh/sshd_config\n\nMake the following changes:\n\n... PermitRootLogin no ... X11Forwarding no ... AllowUsers yourusername ... ...\n\nRestart SSH\n\nsudo systemctl restart ssh.service\n\nSamba server and client\n\nIf you want to be connected with your workstation either from command line or your File Manager (e.g. from another computer in your LAN, Linux, Windows or Mac), install Samba.\n\nRead details in this post: How To Setup Samba on Ubuntu Workstation\n\np7zip\n\np7zip is a port of 7z for POSIX systems like Unix (Linux, Solaris etc).\n\n7z is an Excellent archiving software offering High compression ratio and Strong AES-256 encryption.\n\nsudo apt-get install p7zip-full p7zip-rar\n\nFind more information and examples at this post: Easily Compress and/or Encrypt Files in Linux Using 7z (p7zip) Archiver\n\nunrar\n\nThis is an utility to extract rar files\n\nsudo apt-get install unrar\n\nwipe\n\nWipe is useful to secure delete files.\n\nsudo apt-get install wipe\n\nFor integration (will add an option to right-click menu) with Nautilus file manager (recommended):\n\nsudo apt-get install nautilus-wipe\n\nProgramming Languages\n\nThis section is optional.\n\nAfter Basic Ubuntu setup, the following programming languages are installed:\n\nGNU Bash 4.3.43\n\nPerl 5.22.1\n\nPython 2.7.11+\n\nInstall Java (Oracle JDK 8)\n\nTo install Java, see this post: How To Setup Java on Ubuntu 16.04.\n\nTweak Desktop Graphical Environment\n\nUbuntu settings are available from Top Right menu:\n\nThere are a lot of settings you can modify to tweak your system:\n\nAdditional tools\n\nThe following graphical tools are available to tweak Desktop environment\n\ndconf Editor (low-level configuration system)\n\nsudo apt-get install dconf-tools\n\nUnity tweak tool (settings manager for the Unity desktop)\n\nsudo apt-get install unity-tweak-tool\n\nCompiz config settings manager (settings manager for Compiz OpenGL compositing window manager)\n\nsudo apt-get install compizconfig-settings-manager\n\nSystem Updates Settings\n\nSelect “Software & Updates” from “System Settings” and go to tab “Updates”\n\nThe default setting is “Automatic Download and Install Updates”.

Then use the wizard.\n\nWeb camera\n\nIt will be detected automatically during installation. You can try it using the also preinstalled application cheese.\n\nUPS (Uninterruptible Power Supply)\n\nPower Management module (“System Settings” → “Power”) on Ubuntu 16.04 is a flexible tool to manage your computer UPS. If you have a UPS dedicated to your workstation, Ubuntu “Power Management” is all you need. For more advanced configurations you need more specific software. In my case I use an APC UPS. Here are some scenarios to setup and monitor APC UPS:\n\nManage UPS Using Power Management on Ubuntu 16.04\n\nSetup APC UPS on Ubuntu Workstation using apcupsd\n\nHow to Use APC UPS with Two or More Computers – Master Slave Setup\n\nCloud integration\n\nThere are some solutions to enable (two-way) sync from your Linux desktop to many popular Cloud Storage Services . However, only Dropbox, SpiderOak and Tresorit provide Linux Desktop clients.\n\nI use Google Drive as a cloud-based productivity suite. But I do not sync the files. All files are in the cloud. The main reason is that Google has not (yet) released a Drive Client for Linux. Another reason is I believe that keeping files in Cloud is more secure, than to sync them locally, as most Cloud Storage Services provide AES encryption for the files. The only file I have to my desktop workstation is the KeePassX passwords database. I sync this file with laptop and Android devices using Dropbox.\n\nHowever, if you need a desktop client, here are some of them:\n\nDropbox\n\nSpideroak One\n\nGoogle Drive\n\nThere is no official client at this time. You may try Insync or overGrive.\n\nMicrosoft OneDrive\n\nThere is no official client at this time. You may try this.\n\nApple iCloud (there is no official client at this time)\n\nRecovery mode\n\nPress and hold “SHIFT” key during boot. GRUB (boot loader) menu will display. Select “Advanced Ubuntu Options” to enter Recovery mode.\n\nBackup your workstation\n\nOperating system Image backup\n\nI create an image of Operating System partitions (/boot and /root in my case) using Clonezilla Live. I store image files in an external USB disk and additionally I upload them to a storage service. I prefer Amazon S3. So, in case of disk failure I can restore (again with Clonezilla) my workstation easily and quickly.\n\nData backup\n\nAs I keep all my data in the cloud (mostly Google Drive and Amazon S3) I do not keep data in my workstation. As this practice is not the norm, here are some backup solutions for your data:\n\nDeja-dup\n\nSimple and reliable front-end of Duplicity. You can create local, remote and cloud backups with Deja-dup. Deja-dup is preinstalled (default Ubuntu setup). However, to install it:\n\nsudo apt-get install deja-dup\n\nRunning Deja-Dup for first time press “Install” in the Overview to install software for “Restore”.\n\nIf you need Remote server support for DÃ©jÃ Dup:\n\nsudo apt-get install deja-dup-backend-gvfs\n\nIf you need Amazon S3 and Google Cloud Storage support for DÃ©jÃ Dup:\n\nsudo apt-get install deja-dup-backend-s3\n\nIf you need Rackspace Cloudfiles support for DÃ©jÃ Dup:\n\nsudo apt-get install deja-dup-backend-cloudfiles\n\nDeja-Dup integrates better with Nautilus (Unity, Gnome) than Thunar in XFCE\n\n.\n\nRsnapshot\n\nPowerful Command line utility based on rsync. You can create local, remote but not cloud backups with rsnapshot. Find a custom solution in this post: How To Create Fast And Reliable Backup Using Rsnapshot.\n\nBrowser data backup\n\nI use Google Chrome in all devices. I have more than one “profiles” in Desktop and Laptop, based on some Gmail account. So Chrome sync is enough for me.\n\nCloud Data backup\n\nI download all my data from Google apps (Gmail, Google Drive, Youtube etc) once per week, manually, using Google Takeout.\n\nNOTE: There is not yet Google Takeout API provided by Google. You can automate Google Apps backup using commercial services as Spinbackup, Spanning Backup etc.\n\nI keep these files in a locale storage server (a simple computer running Ubuntu server edition). I upload these files in Amazon S3, using AES encryption provided by Amazon. For this purpose I use a custom shell script I have created.\n\nSynopsis\n\nOperating system\n\nCLI software\n\nProgramming languages\n\nDesktop environment\n\nApps\n\nApps for Web Development\n\nScreenshots Collection"
