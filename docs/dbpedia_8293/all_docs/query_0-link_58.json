He didn't wait for me to check it up until it eventually failed to boot. Once I got a chance to check it, the disk damage had been already beyond recover (the 500 GB disk could only barely read at snail-pace KB/s, and there was no significant continuous readable area found even after several days).\n\nOn the other hand, in another case with the same symptom, the machine owner heeded my warning and left the thing off until I could check it. Of course, it was a hard disk failure. After half a day of GNU DDRescue session and one new hard disk, I brought a good news to him that his system and data was 100% recovered at block level- i.e. all files intact, and ready to boot again without any modification."
