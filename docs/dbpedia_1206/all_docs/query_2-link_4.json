        "text": "Dick Van Dyke is no stranger to helping youth chase their dreams in the performing arts.\n\nFrom reading parts in high school plays to hosting and performing in benefit concerts at the Kavli Theatre in Thousand Oaks, the 98-year-old star of stage, screen and TV—who recently became the oldest actor to receive a Daytime Emmy Award—has been gracious as can be to young singers and actors.\n\nNow, he and wife Arlene have established an endowment so students at one high school won’t have to wonder whether funding for the courses that enrich lives and come with many future-forward skills, will be there.\n\nOn June 15, the couple were on hand for the unveiling of The Arlene & Dick Van Dyke Theater at Malibu High School, not far from his home of 40 years, along with the Van Dyke Endowment for the Arts that, when fully funded, will provide $3 million for arts education in Malibu schools.\n\n“A Magical Afternoon with Arlene & Dick Van Dyke and Friends” was a star-studded gathering that featured magic, food and drink, photos with the legendary actor and comedian, and an auction of photos featuring Van Dyke and his many co-stars, and other items, all benefiting the endowment.\n\nJason Alexander of “Seinfeld” fame emceed a tribute inside the theater, with Mark Hamill (“Star Wars”) and wife Marilou, Michele Lee (who starred as Van Dyke’s love interest in “The Comic”), TV personality Tom Bergeron and Erika Larsen, daughter of the late Magic Castle co-founder Bill Larson, serving as the host committee.\n\n“There’s not enough theater,” Van Dyke said. “When kids get up on stage and sing, they suddenly find out something about themselves.”\n\n“I’ve directed a lot of children, and something changes when they get on the stage. They get a certain feeling of confidence.”\n\nVan Dyke said he’d like to see that instilled in all kids.\n\nTurning back to Malibu, “We’re going to have a real theater program now,” he said to applause from the guests, some of whom paid thousands for a premium experience that day.\n\nVan Dyke said he was a ham from the start.\n\nWhile he made his name in comedic settings, including the movies “Mary Poppins” and “Chitty Chitty Bang Bang” and on TV (“The Carol Burnett Show” and “The Dick Van Dyke Show”), Van Dyke also spread his dramatic wings with shows like “Diagnosis: Murder” where he played Mark Sloan, an MD who solves crimes with help from a detective played by Van Dyke’s son, Barry Van Dyke.\n\nHis eponymous show won Van Dyke three Primetime Emmys, and he’s also won Tony, Screen Actors Guild, Golden Globe and People’s Choice awards. He was named a Disney Legend in 1998, signifying his “impact on the Disney legacy.”\n\nEarlier this month, he won a Daytime Emmy for a guest appearance on NBC’s “Days of Our Lives.”\n\nEven more awards could be in the offing, he quipped.\n\n“I’m going to make 100.”\n\nFor the man born Dec. 13, 1925, that’s just 18 months away.\n\nAlexander told the Acorn that when he hears Dick Van Dyke’s name one thing comes to mind: smiles.\n\n“Dick just has that unusual career–I know he’s done some dramatic work–but more often than not, if he’s in front of you, it’s pure entertainment. His ability to do it, even at 98, is undeterred. It’s just extraordinary.”\n\nBorn Sept. 23, 1959, Alexander said the first movie he ever saw was 1964’s “Mary Poppins,” in which Van Dyke played the chimney sweep Bert and the Ebenezer Scrooge-type Mr. Dawes Sr.\n\n“I have an 18-month-old grandson and I’m going to sit and watch that movie with him someday,” said Alexander. “The stuff that Dick has done does not go out of vogue or out of style.”\n\nVan Dyke came into Alexander’s life about 30 years ago, when Alexander played Van Dyke’s character Albert F. Peterson in the TV version of “Bye Bye Birdie.”\n\n“He sent me the most gorgeous thing after it aired and that’s how we became acquainted,” Alexander said.\n\nIn the early 2000s, when Alexander and Martin Short starred in “The Producers” at the Pantages Theatre in Los Angeles, Alexander looked out in the audience and saw a familiar face.\n\nThe eight-month run brought out show business royalty every night.\n\n“We never, ever acknowledged anyone in the audience during our curtain call, with one exception,” Alexander said.\n\nThat exception was Dick Van Dyke.\n\n“The night that Dick came, Marty and I saw each other at intermission and went, ‘We have to, don’t we? We just have to,’” Alexander said.\n\n“And at the end of our curtain call, we said, ‘Look, everyone in the world has come through this theater and we’ve been honored to have all of them here. But there’s a gentleman here whose career has transcended and become iconic in every medium there is, including the one we stand at tonight. So, we just have to bow to the immortal and great Dick Van Dyke.’”\n\n“He stood up, and that audience,” Alexander added with a wry smile, “suddenly our show was inconsequential.”\n\nAt least they waited till the end.\n\n“We’re not stupid,” said Alexander.\n\nFor Hamill, 72, Van Dyke is sheer joy.\n\n“He’s such a positive force in everyone’s life. I remember being really young watching ‘The Dick Van Dyke Show.’ It was my family’s favorite show. He’s an international treasure.”\n\nHamill worked with Van Dyke’s younger brother, the late Jerry Van Dyke (“Coach”), on a canceled-after-one-season sitcom called “Headmaster.”\n\nOne day in the CBS Studios commissary, Hamill saw Dick Van Dyke sitting alone at a table.\n\n“My mom happened to be visiting that day. So I went up to his table and I said, ‘Mr. Van Dyke, my name’s Mark Hamill, I’m an actor and a huge fan of yours. My mother is with me today, and I was wondering, can I bring her over to meet you?’”\n\nVan Dyke stood up, looked around and asked which one is she?\n\n“I pointed her out and he got up, brought his coffee with him and went over and sat down at her table,” said Hamill, with marvel in his voice, as if it had just happened that very day. “We talked for at least 20 minutes until they came and said, ‘You’re due back on set.’”\n\n“Who else would do that? Only Dick Van Dyke.”\n\nPrincipal Patrick Miller said the endowment will go a long way in helping students follow in Van Dyke’s footsteps— in the arts, and in life.\n\n“We’ve had this hamster wheel of fundraising, where we have to generate over $100,000 every year of local funds,” he said. “To create a more sustainable model, we reached out to the Van Dykes. They’ve been gracious and supportive of our school and our arts programs for many years and they came up with this idea, with our new Malibu Education Foundation, to establish an arts endowment, which will, hopefully, be able to provide the necessary funds to support our programs for future years without having to do that kind of annual hamster wheel cycle.”\n\nThe Van Dykes’ names were added to the existing theater, but the hope is that a new facility in the works will come to fruition–and the Van Dyke name will go up there, too.\n\nMiller said there is so much more to the arts than the joy that comes with singing, dancing, acting or playing an instrument.\n\n“Our kids find more relevancy in all of our arts programs. They’re creating products, they’re doing projects, it’s not just memorizing of content. It’s a lot of skills development as far as working with others, there’s creativity and stretching their brains in different ways,” Miller said.\n\n“The ability to understand and overcome various challenges, to be persistent,” he continued. “These are important things.”"
