        "text": "Legendary actor Dick Van Dyke knows what it takes to stay young, even at the age of 90. Van Dyke will be sharing the secrets of his youthful approach to life at the upcoming One City, One Book event hosted by the City of Agoura Hills.\n\nVan Dyke has starred in many movies and television shows, including “Mary Poppins,” “Chitty Chitty Bang Bang,” “The Dick Van Dyke Show” and, most recently, “Night at the Museum.”\n\nVan Dyke wrote the book, “Keep Moving,” which was selected by Agoura Hills Mayor Harry Schwartz for the annual One City, One Book event. Schwarz said he chose the book because of its overall positive, healthy outlook on aging.\n\n“Dick Van Dyke exemplifies what we all should be doing and thinking as we get older,” Schwarz said. “Frequent activity of body and mind is a positive, healthy formula to keeping in physical and mental shape. His book is a positive affirmation that getting older doesn’t have to be a debilitating experience if we put some effort into it,” said the mayor.\n\nVan Dyke was encouraged to write the memoir by publisher Weinstein Books because of his optimistic outlook and youthful spirit, Schwarz said. The book offers anecdotes and advice about the need to embrace the moment and never lose one’s inner child.\n\nIn the book, Van Dyke says, “You don’t have to act your age. You don’t even have to feel it. And if it does attempt to elbow its way into your life, you do not have to pay attention. If I am out shopping and hear music playing in a store, I start to dance. If I want to sing, I sing. When people ask my secret to staying youthful at an age when getting up and down from your chair on your own is considered an accomplishment, you know what I tell them? ‘Keep moving.’”\n\nVan Dyke is fully embracing a variety of upcoming events to share his upbeat philosophy. He will perform “A Vantastix Night to Remember” at 6 p.m. Fri., April 15 at the Agoura Hills Recreation and Event Center.\n\nThe free program will include a performance with his vocal quartet, The Vantastix, a group that was founded in 2000.\n\nVan Dyke will also discuss his book, “Keep Moving,” coauthored by Todd Gold.\n\nVan Dyke will not be autographing copies of his book at the event, but signed editions will be available for sale.\n\nFamily fun is planned at the evening program, including crafts for kids, a drum circle, parachute play and various demonstrations.\n\nThe event will also feature a DJ, karaoke, a local theater troupe, a show by Agoura High School’s Comedy Sportz group and other performances.\n\nVan Dyke’s grandson, artist Wes Van Dyke, will also showcase his work and demonstrate his painting techniques.\n\nComplimentary hotdogs by Jersey Dogs and salads from Hugo’s will be served. Raffle tickets and giveaways are also planned.\n\nThe One City, One Book celebration will continue at the Agoura Hills Library at 2 and 2:30 p.m. Sat., April 16 with youth programming.\n\nThe 2 p.m. “Let’s Move” event will feature Schwarz reading the book, “Get Up and Go,” by Nancy Larsen, followed by activities, prizes and refreshments.\n\nThe 2:30 p.m. event will screen a movie starring Van Dyke."
