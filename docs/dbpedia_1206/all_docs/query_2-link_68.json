        "text": "Why Members Of Other Associations Need Our Remarkable Team… The #association space is crowded. There are many associations a business leader can choose from when they are looking for ways to enhance the performance of their business. When you look closely, however, each association tends to have a different focus. For example some associations place a priority on business #advocacy. Others focus on member networking events. And many put community engagement on the top of their list. This mosaic of attention creates opportunities for associations to partner with one another for the benefit of their individual members. Recently Board members Ian Tait and Roy Osing of The Business Association Inspired In North Delta, Canada participated in a meeting with Ladner Business Association members. Their pitch: Ladner Members should also join The Business Association Team and get tools and services they don’t get with their current membership. It’s all about serving the needs of members, and if you must suggest to your members that they should join another association because it will benefit their business, then DO IT! Listen in… https://buff.ly/3Vu3AG6 #TheBusinessAssociation #leadership\n\nResearch confirms that Black Canadians continue to be significantly underrepresented in civic leadership roles, including senior public service, regulatory bodies, and other gateway professions to civic leadership roles, such as law, public policy, and business. Research also confirms that this chronic under-representation of Black people in civic leadership roles has taken a serious toll on the engagement of Black Canadian youth in Canada's civic life. The 1834 Foundation’s programs are designed to help reverse this trend, and to help create a new generation of high-calibre Black civic leaders. Apply today and join our FIFTH cohort: https://lnkd.in/gWVVXMfH The incredible members of Cohort 3 included: Eyasu Y., Janelle O., Naomi Hudson, Abigail Isaac, Keren Harrison, Lidia Sumamo, Toluwani A., Ganiyat Sadiq, Hermon Afowork, Hannah Godefa, Ebenezer Belayneh, Sinit Abraha, Clèche Kokolo, Jaiden Medford, Anu Popoola, Stephanie O., Niki Harris, Tsahai Carter, Keren Harrison, Keean Nembhard.\n\nCompany Founder Vanessa Geita was invited to speak on a \"savings culture\" with a professional accountants insight. Although accounting is a core business function, the same underlying principles apply when it comes to saving money for personal financial goals, like the experience of purchasing your 1st home. We are privileged, as an outsourced accounting service provider, to look into fellow MSME's finance management set ups. Sadly, 99.9% of those we've met do not open up a 2nd business bank account to proactively save for business taxes, emergencies, and investments. During this event, we shared 4 factors that influence your ability to save money for big dreams like buying your 1st home: 1️⃣ Your problems: Whatever prevents you to move from just THINKING about it, to actually DOING it. 2️⃣ Your Systems & Tools: A dedicated SAVINGS bank account is one of the oldest, simplest ways to automate recurring transfers into for that big money goal. 3️⃣ Your Behaviours: The work of actually TAKING ACTION to use the savings systems and tools to achieve your savings goal. 4️⃣ Your Beliefs: Change your thought-patterns about savings so you behave like someone who saves money to systematically reach your savings goals. At the end of the day, an accountants advice on savings won't help you to actually save money. It's YOU who will set aside that money to achieve your dreams. You are capable. #createyourdreams\n\nAs the world yearns for change, alternative leadership models emerge as beacons of hope. Challenging conventional notions of power and hierarchy, they embrace collaboration, empathy, and shared decision-making. Inspired by our own shift into co-leadership, we embark on a journey to explore diverse alternative leadership models and their potential impact on liberation and the food justice movement. Today, we dive into the world of cooperatives. Cooperatives are businesses that are owned, operated, and democratically-controlled by their members. This alternative leadership model has a rich history of building community resources and nurturing strong communities.
