The pair had four children: Christian, Barry, Stacy and Carrie Beth.\n\nIn addition to his real-life loves, Van Dyke also had palpable chemistry with his onscreen wife Mary Tyler Moore on the Dick Van Dyke Show, which ran from 1961 to 1966 and earned 15 Emmy Awards.\n\nKeep scrolling to see Van Dyke’s life and career in photos:\n\nOriginal Article by US Magazine https://www.usmagazine.com/entertainment/pictures/dick-van-dyke-through-the-years-mary-poppins-and-more/"
