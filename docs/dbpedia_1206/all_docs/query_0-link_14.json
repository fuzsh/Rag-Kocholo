        "text": "Every good story has at least one villain. Fortunately for our story, but unfortunately for linguistic scholarship, the history of the Dutch language on the American East Coast also has its villain. What is more: that history ends with him. His name is Lawrence Gwyn van Loon.\n\nVan Loon was born in New York City in 1903, and he died in the village of Gloversville, New York, in 1985. When he was a boy, his maternal grandfather, Walter Hill, taught him the tawl, the Dutch that at that time was still spoken in the Mohawk Valley. During his holidays, together with his father and his grandfather, the young Van Loon would visit a number of older people who still had some command of the tawl. That was the beginning of Van Loon’s lifelong relationship with the Dutch language. But already during the days of his secondary education, as he wrote in 1980, “things got … a bit blurry … but at least skeletons remained.”\n\n[. . .]\n\nThe interest in the Dutch language spoken on the American East Coast that was awakened in his youth remained with Van Loon during the rest of his life. He devoted several publications to it, starting in 1938 with the book Crumbs from an Old Dutch Closet. The Dutch Dialect of Old New York. It was published by Martinus Nijhoff, a prestigious publisher in The Hague. Van Loon describes Mohawk Dutch, the dialect he had heard spoken in the Mohawk Valley in his youth. Interestingly, nowhere in the book is any account given of how the material was collected, nor of who the informants involved were\n\n[. . .]\n\nAs recently as the year 2000,Van Loon’s 1938 book was characterized by an American linguist as “one of the most cited sources on the structure of the Dutch dialect of upstate New York and its late survival.” That is not surprising: it was the first and only description of Mohawk Dutch.\n\n[ . . ]\n\nThe jubilant mood over the description of the last phrases of spoken Dutch on the American East Coast changed to one of deep mistrust in the course of the 1980s, when it was established that other work by Van Loon, also relating to relics of Dutch settlers on the East Coast, was based on forged documents – we shall come back to this later. Retrospectively, all Van Loon’s work and all the documents he had handled became suspect.\n\nJohnny dog; enookierat; raccoon\n\nIn the foregoing glossary will be found three forms which bear explanation. Under the heading ‘B’ is found the word ‘johnny dog’ for ‘beaver’. So far as may be determined there never was an American dialect word ‘johnny dog’ used in this way. Further no German word approached this, and still further no dialect word such as ‘jean d’eau’ (which seems to resemble the ‘johnnydog’ somewhat) was in use among the French to designate a beaver. The only other dialect which might have influenced the Hudson-Mohawk Dutch of the period were the Indian dialects and of these the Mohawk or Iroquois probably was most influential in and around Albany (Fort Orange). Some Algonkian words have been noted in writings, it should be stated here. Anent the Iroquois, one notes with interest that a beaver was then, and still is today known by various terms among these people, all of which are slightly different spellings and pronunciations of the same word, as, ‘Tsannitoh’ from Hewitt’s Iroquoian Cosmology; ‘Tsiennito’ from the Lexique de la langue Iroquoise; and ‘janedoh’ from private communications from the reservation of the Iroquois at Deseronto, Canada.\n\nThe second, found under the heading ‘M’ is the term ‘enookierat’ (and the term ‘nookierat’) for ‘muskrat’. The remarks made above will also serve here. Among the Mohawks, the muskrat which was doubtless a new animal for the earliest settlers, was known as ‘Anokien’. This derivation is therefore possible.\n\nThe third found under the heading ‘R’ is the word ‘suikerdas’ for ‘raccoon’. This might have been two good Dutch words, ‘suiker’ – sugar, and ‘das’ badger, or badger-like animal. The raccoon resembles in some ways a badger (for example as to color) but in their native state they have nothing to do with sugar, and their tastes run to nothing sweeter than green corn. From a private communication from the Onondaga reservation near Syracuse, one learns that the Onondaga term for raccoon was, and is (with of course, the same variations as mentioned under the first example) known as ‘Tsogerak’, the first two syllables of which resemble not a little the word ‘suiker’. If one adds to this the fact that the animal is a ‘das’, i.e. a badger-like animal, one arrives close to the word ‘suikerdas’. Along with this hypothesis one must presuppose that Onondagas were moderately plentiful in the lower Mohawk valley, at least in the later years of the colony.’"
