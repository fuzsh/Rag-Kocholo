        "text": "After an illustrious career as a physics professor at Yale and Phillips Exeter Academy, Russell Sturgis Bartlett came to The Gunnery in 1942 from the Newark College of Engineering, where he had worked on the revision of the College Boards, which resulted in the institution of the SATs.\n\nBartlett studied at Taft and Yale, Class of 1917, graduating Phi Beta Kappa and summa cum laude. He joined the U.S. Navy and served as lieutenant j.g. in command of submarines during World War I.\n\nHaving received his Ph.D. from Yale in 1924, he returned to England, where he studied with Nobel Prize winner and discoverer of the electron, Sir J.J. Thomson, at Cavendish Laboratories and Trinity College at the University of Cambridge. Dr. Bartlett was a member of the British Royal Scientific Society and studied at the King’s College, London.\n\nHe and his wife, Emilie Jeannette Daggett, had three children: Beatrice \"Betsy\" Sturgis Bartlett, William Mayhew Bartlett ’48, and Susan Leigh Bartlett Bull.\n\nHe led the school through World War II, arranging for accelerated graduation by instituting a six-day week and a summer session to accommodate students directly affected by the new draft law. He also introduced courses in meteorology, navigation, gasoline engines, semaphore and Morse code, and cartography to prepare the students for war service. He taught some of the science classes, including navigation, when some of the science faculty left to serve in the war. He also marshaled the students to help replace men from Washington in the military, creating a volunteer firefighting unit and helping local farms with their plantings and harvests.\n\nSadly, Bartlett fell ill in 1944 and died a year later. He left his scientific library to The Gunnery as a precious legacy.\n\nAs The Gunnery’s 11th Head of School, Peter Becker ushered in a transformative period of growth while seeking to strengthen the school’s ties to its founder in ways that are relevant to a 21st-century boarding school education. Like Frederick and Abigail Gunn, he was both a leader and innovator. In 2020, with the leadership and support of the Board of Directors, the school made the bold and historic decision to change its name to The Frederick Gunn School, to honor Mr. Gunn, his vision and ideals. Through Peter's leadership, the school evolved intentionally, guided by the goals of a strategic plan that focuses on People, Place and Program. The transformation of the campus during Peter's headship included:\n\nThe opening of Graham House, our newest dorm for Gunn girls, in October 2016\n\nThe dedication of the College Counseling Office in October 2013\n\nThe groundbreaking for the turf field, in May 2014\n\nThe opening of South Street Fields in October 2015\n\nThe opening of the Thomas S. Perakos Arts and Community Center in January 2020, including the Tisch Family Auditorium, established through the gift of Jonathan Tisch '72 and Steve Tisch '67; an art wing honoring benefactor Richard C. Colton, Jr. '60; and the Norman R. Lemcke Community Room, established through a gift of the Class of 1968, in celebration of their 50th reunion, to honor the late Norman R. Lemcke, Jr. P'78 '84. The Perakos Family Cares Gallery honors the building's namesake, Thomas Perakos '69, and was given by Tom and the Class of 1969, in celebration of their 50th reunion and in honor of Wallace H. Rowe III H’57 P’77 ’79.\n\nThe groundbreaking in 2022 for the Lizzie and Jonathan Tisch Center for Innovation and Active Citizenship, which will fully integrate science, math, engineering, technology, entrepreneurship, and citizenship classes in the center of campus. \"The Lizzie,\" as it is affectionately known, was established through a $25 million gift from Lizzie and Jonathan Tisch '72, the largest philanthropic commitment in the history of the school, and is set to open in January 2024, overlooking the historic Quad.\n\nThe creation of new programs, including IDEAS Lab, established in 2017 with an emphasis on experiential classes in engineering and robotics; and a unique Winterim curriculum, launched in 2020, which challenges students to step away from traditional coursework for two weeks to embrace one big question or idea;\n\nThe establishment of the Center for Citizenship and Just Democracy, created in 2019 with the support of a $100,000 matching grant from the E.E. Ford Foundation;\n\nThe enhancement of Gunn Outdoors, which which offers more opportunities for students to engage with the outdoors, develop leadership skills, and gain independence;\n\nThe creation of the Thomas R. King '60 Family Chair for Excellence in Teaching, endowed through the leadership and generosity of Trustee Tom King '60 and his wife, Kathy, in support of the school's commitment to attract and retain the best faculty.\n\nDuring his tenure, Peter said the school’s commitment was “to evolve, as intentionally as possible, our place and our programs. The evidence around campus that we are doing so is plentiful and exciting.”\n\nEmily Raudenbush Gum became The Frederick Gunn School’s 12th Head of School in 2023. A graduate of The Hill School, Emily holds a Master of Arts with Joint Honours in International Relations and Theological Studies from the University of St. Andrews. Following the completion of her studies in Scotland, Emily earned a Master of Philosophy in Theology and Religion, with distinction, from the University of Oxford in England. Currently, she is nearing the defense of her Doctor of Philosophy in Theology and Religion at the University of Oxford, where she has presented her thesis, “The Role of Identity Formation in the Education of Children.”\n\nEmily joined the Gunn community in 2018 as Assistant Head of School for Teaching and Learning. Among the most transformational impacts of her leadership in this role was to define school founder Frederick Gunn’s educational philosophy for the 21st century as four pillars — learning yourself and how to learn; risk taking and innovation; a sense of rootedness and place; and public character and active citizenship. As a member of the school’s Senior Team, Emily engaged in all strategic planning and initiatives. She developed a comprehensive set of objectives on Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion, which were adopted by the Board in 2020. She was a key contributor in the initiative to write the school’s current Core Values, the most recent review of our Strategic Plan, and actively engaged in marketing and enrollment strategies.\n\nPrior to joining The Frederick Gunn School, Emily served in several leadership roles with the Institute for Advanced Studies in Culture (IASC) at the University of Virginia and its affiliate foundations over a 13-year period. During her tenure, she achieved a multi-million dollar fundraising initiative, managed daily operations and annual budgets, accomplished branding work focusing on inclusivity, edited The Hedgehog Review, launched a social impact non-profit, and wrote and spoke about ethics, character education, contemporary social and political theory, religion, questions of identity and diversity, and educational theory.\n\nEmily and her husband, Wheeler, are the proud parents of two young children, Hezze and George."
