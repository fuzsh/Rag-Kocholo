        "text": "I started watching it on Peacock from the beginning and, four episodes in, my skin is crawling. A cast filled with seriously unpleasant people (including MTM, who I generally adore). I haven't laughed once. In fact, my only impulse has been to either beat the shit out of their kid Richie or Sally.\n\nWas this show like Seinfeld or Friends, where the first seasons were pretty terrible, and then they hit their stride?\n\nAs a kid, I thought it was sophisticated. I was used to Andy Griffith, Father Knows Best, Bevery Hillbillies, I Love Lucy, Pete and Gladys, and that sort of thing, some I watch as reruns after school or late at night. Women were either daffy or matronly.\n\nBut then came a new idea - smart, stylish women, like Mary in the Dick Van Dyke show and Samantha in Bewitched. It was like a new idea for me - that women didn't have to be in the kitchen with the apron, serving dinner to the kids, or being childish and silly.\n\nI don't know if that makes sense, but I had never seen couples having cocktails or women acting modern like they did in those two shows and probably some others I can't remember now. The mid to later 1960s was a revolution in how couples and families were presented on tv.\n\nThe episodes that focus more on life at home are much funnier than the episodes that focus on the office. I liked Rose Marie, but I never liked Morey Amsterdam,.\n\nLarry Matthews as Richie rarely has anything to do, which is good. But you cannot escape Morey Amsterdam.\n\nThe other thing I'll say is that it's one of those shows where not every episode is good, but there are ones that are so good they're unforgettable: \"It May Look Like a Walnut,\" \"Coast-to-Coast Big Mouth,\" \"What's in a Name?\", \"Washington vs. the Bunny,\" etc.\n\nIt was a brilliant show and stands the test of time. However, you like what you like. I'm the one that thinks Aretha Franklin is overrated. The standout of the show was Millie. She was the slapstick part of the show, a little seperate than the normal, more sophisticated aspect of the show. The scenes with Laura and Millie was the best part of the show. Especially, quite racy for the time, Millie and Laura are browsing in an art store and they find a nude painting of Laura. Or when Laura's first serious, and EXTREMELY hot, boyfriend shows up. Millie is gaga over him.\n\nThey begged Ann Morgan Guilbert to come on as a regular instead of just a recurring. She wanted no part of the grind. Specifically waiting around on set until they needed her. They offered what was then unheard of money to a supporting character. Of course she would later go on to play the grandmother on The Nanny. She was brilliant, and like Lucy, and few other female comediennes, she was not afraid to play the nut case.\n\n[quote]They begged Ann Morgan Guilbert to come on as a regular instead of just a recurring.

Of course she would later go on to play the grandmother on The Nanny. She was brilliant, and like Lucy, and few other female comediennes, she was not afraid to play the nut case.\n\nShe capped off her career by giving Harry Dean Stanton a blowjob on \"Getting On.\"\n\nOne of my favorite episodes concerned a very much oversized piece of jewelry(family heirloom?) that Laura absolutely hated. When it gets destroyed Laura is certain that the family will never forgive her.\n\n#1 has to be the episode when Rob and Laura thought their new baby had been switched in the hospital, due to a similarity in last names. The denouement, when the corresponding parents show up at their place, and in walk an African American couple, is priceless top shelf comedy(right up there with the ending segment of 'Newhart')\n\nI also enjoyed the episodes that highlighted Carl Reiner as the titular and over-the-top abrasive star of 'The Alan Brady Show.' \"Shut up, Mel!\"\n\n[quote] OP Friends was massively over rated.\n\nI only used that as an example because I remember the first season being so bad as opposed to the rest of the series. It really took them a full season to figure things out. Same with Seinfeld, except it took 2-3 seasons (but their seasons were very short at first). And those early episodes are nearly unwatchable as compared to later ones. I wondered if DVD took the same amount of time to find its stride, because 4 episodes in I am not feeling it. The only thing I've loved so far has been the original Petrie kitchen which they redid for the rest of the series.\n\nThe first episode has them going to a party at Alan Brady's and Rob and Sally entertaining the guests with two of the unfunniest skits I've ever sat through.\n\nHowever, enough people have chimed in that the show definitely finds its rhythm, so I will stick with it.\n\nThey named the kid Richie after Mary's real-life son, who killed himself at 24 (supposedly an accident). They had a rocky relationship. I remember reading that she said she didn't know what to do with a spoiled child. Thanks, mom.\n\n\"The Mary Tyler Moore Show actress welcomed Richie with her first husband, Richard Meeker, in 1961 when she was 18. Due to her busy schedule, she and Richie became estranged for some time.\n\n“I demanded a lot of Richie. I was responsible for a lot of alienation,” she admitted. “There is no question about it. By the time Richie was 5, I had already let him down. When he needed me the most, I was busier and even more self-concerned than I had been when he was an impressionable infant.”\n\n\"Richie, who eventually reconnected with Moore, would later seek treatment for drug abuse. In her memoir, Moore recounted the time he called her “frantic and sobbing” because he was in trouble with a drug dealer...\"\n\n[quote] What always strikes me about this show whenever I watch it is how LOUD it is. The canned laughter, the characters' voices--especially Mary (whom I otherwise enjoy as a performer); her voice is so shrill and grating. Even when I enjoy the comedy of it, I have to turn the volume way down not to be irritated.\n\nIMO, the crying / heaving / talking thing Mary did was irritating. She did that a couple of times on the MTM show.\n\nJerry Van Dyke is like Dick Van Dyke X10 as far any irritating characteristics DVD might have.\n\nI always assumed Millie's onscreen time was cut back because Jerry Paris moved behind the camera. I believe he ended up directing at least half of the episodes over their five year run.\n\nI loved the show but I could always tell when Carl Reiner was involved in writing an episode. The early eps. made Rob come across like a condescending jerk to \"Laurie\"\n\nI hated the ep where he reminds her she promised to love honor and OBEY. As the series progressed they became much more of an equal pairing and he became much more likeable as the somewhat put-upon husband. Laura, became less judgemental as well. The cast became a well-oiled machine and I liked them all.\n\nI saw an episode of The New Dick Van Dyke Show recently. I remember watching it when it was on in prime time. I remember I wanted it to be successful because I liked him. Hope Lange was like dead weight, she won two Emmys for comedy (The Ghost And Mrs. Muir) but she didn't know how to be funny in this. Fanny Flagg and Nancy Dussault were pretty good on the show. The episode I saw was a pretty good one (with Dick in jail on Christmas Eve). Because Dick lived in Arizona he insisted the show be made (and set) there.\n\nI have been enjoying several episodes, despite the horrible screaming acting from Larry Mathews. Any time Rose Marie sings is a treat. I had no idea she had such a terrific voice. I do hope they kept the JerryVan Dyke appearances to a minimum, because he's like nails on a chalkboard.\n\nHowever, I happen to be watching one of the dumbest plots I've ever seen for any sitcom. It's a season 2 episode where Richie is getting attacked by a giant woodpecker and no one believes him. They must have been desperate for a story that week.\n\nI always thought it was a wildly uneven show when iIwas growing up.\n\nIt could be genuinely funny and give me a lot of pleasure (one very enjoyable episode that's not been talked about yet so far as I can see is \"The Ghost of A. Chantz,\" when all the cast is at a hunting lodge that appears to be haunted).\n\nBut there were certainly a lot of dreary episodes too. As others have said, anything with Rob's annoying brother Stacy, any flashbacks to Rob's and Laura's USO days, and usually any episode that focused too much on working out new comedy skits at the office were tedious. Anything that focused on Rob & Laura's home life in New Rochelle (especially if the Halpers were around) was usually enjoyable.\n\nI do think the poster who keeps claiming Dick Van Dyke and Mary Tyler Moore were not good dancers is really off-base and needs to shut up. They may not have been as staggeringly accomplished dancers as were, say, Chita Rivera or Juliet Prowse, but they absolutely were fine enough dancers for television and film and Broadway.\n\nI never remember the show being funny, but it was familiar and comforting. Rob and Laura were young, attractive and modern. Sure Lucy Ricardo wore pants too - but she was Lucille Ball, for Christ’s sake. She was about as sexy as a Pekingese.\n\nThe Petries were subconsciously connected to Camelot (the Kennedy presidency) in the minds of viewers. Rob and Laura were young and modern like JFK and Jackie. They had a young child. Their house was modernist and sleek. But they still slept in separate beds, as decreed by the censors. Buddy & Sally were wisecracking coworkers, who took the place of wisecracking neighbors. Alan Brady was the familiar sitcom character of the demanding boss who was “going to kill” Rob, Sally and Buddy if they didn’t deliver a perfect, funny show *right now.* Richard Deacon was the closeted gay guy, “the fussy one.”\n\nI remember being glad to watch the show after the JFK assassination because it meant normalcy still existed, the world hadn’t ended, there wouldn’t be a war and Rob and Laura would be our substitute for the Golden Couple we lost. I was really young at the time, in catholic school where we got punished, beaten, insulted; we were forced to attend Latin mass, confession, stations of the cross, say penance, get communion and a whole roster of Stupid Shit. I was glad Laura and Rob kept the home fires burning.\n\nBut I never found it funny. Dick van Dyke mugged too much\n\nIn those days, tv shows used to do holiday themes shows, like Christmas and Halloween. I liked that and liked that Chad and Jeremy were on it.\n\nOP here. I am just getting into Season 4. I will say the show definitely improved and Season 3 has been the high point. I can already tell we're on a downswing with the episode where they go to a fishing lodge and stay in a supposedly haunted cabin (even though the punch line is based in reality, it's super stupid and could be seen a mile away).\n\nI've laughed several times, but mostly at clever lines and rarely at any of DVD's physical comedy, which I find hammy and much too broad to be funny. For me, the MVPs are Amsterdam and Rose Marie. Amsterdam never met a corny line that he can't make funnier with his delivery, and Rose Marie is such a pro that you could actually believe she's coming up with her responses in real time instead of them being scripted. They are fantastic.\n\nAgreed with the majority here that the weakest episodes are the flashback ones. I hate Rob in the Army. So much so, that I've begun fast forwarding through those episodes. And the \"let's put on a show\" episodes are starting to get grating.\n\nAnd I still find MTM a bit of a shrew in this. Laura behaves like a classic manic depressive. If I was Rob, I would have found a quack doctor to keep her on an endless supply of Miltown.\n\nTwo things that really helped it: the writers and directors, and perhaps himself, really reigned in DVD's slapstick and attempted cutsiness. They took him down several notches. However the special sauce really turned out to be MTM. One of the things that helped her was the faith they put in a newcomer and the fashions of the era.....it was like they were special made for her. No one wore them better. Millie was the unexpected cherry on top. I'm glad she didn't want the role to be expanded. It might have been to much of a good thing. Millie was primordial Rhoda.\n\nFunny, but Millie has not made much of an impression on me. I would not have wanted to see her in an expanded role because what they gave her to do didn't seem to improve the show. I thought Jerry was a much more interesting character. Millie just always seemed to be there for Laura to vent to. And I adore Ann Morgan Guilbert. Loved her on The Nanny and thought she should have gotten an Oscar nomination for the otherwise dreary Please Give.\n\nThe one thing that is really not ringing true to me is how often Buddy goes to stuff without his wife. He always seems to be coupled with Sally. I don't buy that a wife would stand for being left home by herself as much as Pickles is. They should have either made Buddy divorced or included Pickles a little more than they did.\n\n[quote] The one thing that is really not ringing true to me is how often Buddy goes to stuff without his wife.\n\nThat always happens on sitcoms. IRL, people always take their spouses to night-time work \"parties,\" etc.\n\nOn TV, they want to avoid creating an extra character. Hence, these guys always have time away from their wives.\n\nOn the MTM show, Murray and Lou did have wives that were characters. However, they didn't appear very often. A couple of us conjectured that nobody wanted to see Joyce Bulifant (Murray's wife, Marie) any more than was necessary.\n\nThat said, during college, I worked in a Cheers-type bar (but more dive-y). There were a bunch of regulars who sat in the bar, drinking, for hours (without their wives). The majority of them were married, some of them had young children. (This was an after-work type of bar.)\n\n[quote] I don't think we ever saw Mel's or Alan's wives. Alan's wife was Mel's sister, I believe.\n\nI just watched an episode where Rob takes over for Mel as producer for a week because the guest star hates him. Rob is at Mel's desk and behind him on the table, there's a framed 8x10 of some hot tamale I'm assuming is meant to be Mel's wife. She doesn't look like someone who would either be related to Alan Brady or attracted to Mel Cooley.\n\n[quote] I would have found a quack doctor to keep her on an endless supply of Miltown.\n\nR144 That reminds me of some of the lyrics to a mid-1960s song parity by comedy writer Allen Sherman, named “Pills” (sung to the tune of the song “Smiles.”\n\n“Benzedrine and Miltown / To pick you up or let you down”\n\nFollowed by:\n\n“Or if you’re sufferin’ / Swallow a Bufferin”\n\nAllen Sherman became famous writing and singing his lyrics to existing song melodies on several best-selling records. In retrospect, it didn’t take much to make some of us laugh back then. That may in part explain why the DVD Show doesn’t always seem as funny now as it did then.\n\n[quote] I can already tell we're on a downswing with the episode where they go to a fishing lodge and stay in a supposedly haunted cabin (even though the punch line is based in reality, it's super stupid and could be seen a mile away).\n\nThat was a Halloween episode.. Shows did “spooky” Halloween episodes in those days. This one was a spoof on the popular horror movie theme of a group of people having to spend a night in a deserted place that’s rumored to be haunted.\n\nAnother Halloween DVD episode was It May Look Like a Walnut. These Halloween episodes are corny and forced, but I loved them as a kid.\n\nI thought the flying saucer episode was a Halloween show but apparently it aired in late September.\n\nOh, I hated the walnut episode, absolutely hated it. So far it's in my Top 5 worst.\n\nI just watched a surprisingly fun flashback episode, mostly thanks to MTM's performance. It's the one that was referenced earlier where Millie gives Laura her pills to calm her down before meeting Rob's parents for the first time. MTM was just fabulous in the episode and made the usual stinkeroo flashback bearable.\n\nTrouble is ahead, according to IMdB. I'm about to hit a Stacy Petrie 2-parter. I'm already grinding my teeth.\n\n[quote] It May Look Like a Walnut\" is pretty much considered the greatest of all DVD Show episodes\n\nNot OP, but I thought the Christmas episode with the families being on the Alan Brady Show was considered the greatest episode. I remember they were dressed as nutcrackers, sang and danced.\n\nI read that Perry Como used to have family members of the show’s staff on his Christmas episodes, and I actually saw an old Lawrence Welk show where he had the families of his staff on his Christmas show. I remember seeing the children - boys with their short, brylcreamed hair, spaces between their teeth where their baby teeth had fallen out and new teeth were pointed like fangs emerging from their gums. Girls were ponytailed, wore headbands pushing the hair off their faces, wore plaid dresses, white socks and patent leather shoes. It gave me flashbacks of how I had to dress up for holidays as a kid, and be in my best behavior for an hour or two before I devolved back into my real self.\n\nOne of my favorite Dick Van Dyke episodes is the one where they think the reporter is doing an interview of them and they all act like pompous asses and then find out that she’s actually the decorator. Every bit of that episode is perfectly written and executed, all the way to the last moment with Lara and Rob and the magazine…\n\nOf course the cherry on the cake is that the reporter/decorator is played with perfect dryness and drollness by Carolyn Appleby a.k.a. Doris Singleton.\n\nR91 \"However, I happen to be watching one of the dumbest plots I've ever seen for any sitcom. It's a season 2 episode where Richie is getting attacked by a giant woodpecker and no one believes him. They must have been desperate for a story that week. \"\n\nActually, this episode was written by Carlo Reiner, and is based on a true story of what happened to one of his neighbors. Most of what he wrote was based on real life experiences. So, sometimes facts is stranger than fiction.\n\nFinished the series. I will definitely say that, though it took them the full first season to get there, they really did find their way and produced an entertaining series that still feels a might overrated, but I can definitely see how, for the time, it stood out as intelligent and sophisticated.\n\nAgain, MVP awards to Rose Marie and Morey Amsterdam, who went a long way to making the show as funny and entertaining as it was. DVD was fine, but I would not call myself a massive fan of his. aside from the kid, who was horrible, I think the weak spot was Mary Tyler Moore. The majority of the problem was the way she was written. Laura was a bi-polar harridan who browbeat and pussywhipped her husband. At the slightest provocation, she would overreact and he had to spend half the episode groveling in front of her. She was nowhere near perfect herself, yet Rob was much more understanding at her mistakes than she with his. Again, much of that was in the writing, but I wish Moore would have found a way to make Laura less grating when she did behave that way. For me, that was the biggest fault of the show. And I adore MTM. The Mary Tyler Moore Show was probably my 2nd all time favorite television program, and I thought she was a wonderful actress, in everything from Ordinary People to Flirting With Disaster.\n\nOk, now on to another new old show."
