        "text": "The WGAW Board of Directors places individuals or companies on the Strike/Unfair List for several types of unfair conduct, including:\n\nHiring of Guild members without becoming a signatory company;\n\nRefusal to bargain with the WGA;\n\nRefusal to participate in grievance and arbitration procedures;\n\nFailure to comply with a final arbitration award;\n\nFailure to pay P&H fund delinquencies; and\n\nViolation of the National Labor Relations Act or other laws designed to protect writers.\n\nThe Board of Directors will consider requests from individuals or companies to be removed from the Strike/Unfair List. In such cases, the Board will examine the facts and circumstances concerning the listing, and the reasons advanced for removal. Contact Legal for more information.\n\nMembers are prohibited from working for employers on the Strike/Unfair List. According to Working Rule 10, “no member may enter into a contract for the rendition of writing services with any producer whose name is contained in the then current Guild [Strike/Unfair] list unless such producer shall have first posted a bond with the Guild guaranteeing the full amount of the writer’s proposed compensation pursuant to such contract.” Members violating Working Rule 10 are subject to an automatic fine.\n\nNOTE: The absence of a company from the Strike/Unfair List does not mean that it is a current signatory. According to Working Rule 8, “no member shall accept employment with, nor option or sell literary material to, any person, firm or corporation who is not signatory to the applicable MBAs.” Please confirm with the WGAW's Signatories Department whether a producer/employer is signatory, or consult the Guild's Signatory Lookup. The Guild is the only reliable source of such information.\n\nWGAW STRIKE/UNFAIR LIST:"
