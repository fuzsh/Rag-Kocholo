        "text": "Dick Van Dyke\n\n/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/dvdlib1.mp3\n\nThough best known for his pioneering work in television, Dick Van Dyke has also excelled in the worlds of film and theatre. And yet for someone who has spent so much time in front of audiences, he remains by all accounts a very private person, unknowable even to his closest friends and family. What is immediately apparent to anyone is his enormous talent.\n\nThis page explores one of entertainment’s most versatile performers, whose long and multifaceted career continues to thrive.\n\nBibliography\n\nUntil recently, no book-length biography had been written about Dick Van Dyke. That changed in 2011 with the publication of his memoirs, My Lucky Life In and Out of Show Business. Through the years he has also penned several short books dealing lightheartedly with children, school, and religion.\n\nBooks by Dick Van Dyke:\n\nAltar Egos. Westwood, N.J.: F.H. Revell Co., 1967. The lighter side of religion.\n\nFaith, Hope and Hilarity. Garden City, N.Y.: Doubleday, 1970. Like Altar Egos, deals humorously with religion, but this time in relation to kids.\n\nThe Meaning of Christmas: A Story in Sound. New York: Harper & Row, 1974. A book and sound recording combo.\n\nMy Lucky Life In and Out of Show Business. New York: Crown Archetype, 2011. Dick’s memoirs. The audiobook version is read by Van Dyke himself and is recommended for his engaging narration.\n\nThose Funny Kids! Garden City, N.Y.: Doubleday, 1975. “A treasury of classroom laughter” containing anecdotes from teachers and students. Also contains reminiscences by Van Dyke about growing up in Danville.\n\nProgram Guides:\n\nVan Deusen, David. To Twilo and Beyond!

Many Celebrity Profiles are puff pieces, but this one contains real insight into the actor.\n\nDick Van Dyke: Put on a Happy Face (video). New York : A&E Home Video, 2000, 1999. Part of A&E’s popular “Biography” series, this 100-minute program is a solid introduction to the performer.

A complete list may be found on IMDB.\n\nDick has also won or been nominated for numerous awards throughout his long career. In addition to winning five Emmy Awards (one Daytime and four Primetime), a Tony, and a Grammy, he has received lifetime achievement awards from a number of organizations: The Screen Actors Guild; Television Critics Association; American Comedy Awards USA; The Golden Apple Awards; and other groups.
