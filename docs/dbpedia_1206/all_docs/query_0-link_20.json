        "text": "Dick Van Dyke's workout routine is his \"secret weapon\".\n\nThe Hollywood legend does three gym sessions a week at the age of 98, and he believes that it's the key to his good health.\n\nHe told 'Entertainment Tonight': \"I recommend it to everybody. That's my secret weapon.\"\n\nThe award-winning star feels that actors are in a privileged position.\n\nDick admitted that he's had \"such a good time\" during his decades-long career in the movie business.\n\nThe 'Chitty Chitty Bang Bang' actor - who received a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame back in 2012 - shared: \"It isn't work - it's play. Actors are so lucky. I've had such a good time.\"\n\nDespite this, Dick suggested that he's the last of his kind in Hollywood.\n\nThe veteran star said: \"I think I'm the last of my generation, really. I'm 98. I have almost all my marbles. I can't remember what I had for breakfast.\"\n\nDespite his success, Dick actually battled an alcohol addiction for 25 years of his life.\n\nThe actor previously admitted that his addiction damaged his family life.\n\nDick - who was married to Margie Willett between 1948 and 1984 - told the Guardian newspaper: \"I tried to be a good role model to my children, but I was an alcoholic for 25 years, which inevitably impacted on family life.\n\n\"When I went into therapy, I realised I was repeating my father’s mistakes. He often came home drunk after lengthy road trips and my mother threatened to walk out unless he quit – which he did.\n\n\"When I pledged to quit and entered a rehab clinic, Margie checked in as I checked out. I thought she’d come to pick me up, but it turned out she was hooked on antidepressants. I had no idea. What a pair.\""
