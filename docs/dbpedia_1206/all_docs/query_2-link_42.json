        "text": "Yesterday I published an article discussing the 2023 draft class. I intend to take a bit of a break this month, which will include a family holiday, but I’m already into the 2023 work and will post when I’ve studied certain players.\n\nMiami quarterback Tyler Van Dyke is a very interesting prospect.\n\nHe’s only a redshirt sophomore (like Bryce Young) so it’s not a given he’ll declare for the draft in 12 months. He only started in 2021 after an injury to D’Eriq King. He may prefer to gain a little bit more experience before turning pro. We’ll see how 2022 goes for him and if it’s going well, I’m sure we’ll hear about his intentions soon enough.\n\nAccording to PFF he was the only quarterback in the FBS to finish in the top-10 for passing yards, touchdowns, big-time throws and big-time throw rate in the second half of the season. He lifted a team that was struggling to a 5-1 record down the stretch.\n\nI am a little bit concerned about Mario Cristobal going to Miami. The offense he ran at Oregon didn’t make the most of Justin Herbert and made him a harder evaluation than was necessary. Van Dyke is at his best throwing downfield, attacking opponents with his arm — not indulging in all the screens and slants that Herbert was lumbered with.\n\nCristobal has spoken about tailoring an offense to fit Van Dyke though, so there is that.\n\nSo what does he do well?\n\nI watched three games to get a feel for him. One early in the 2021, two later on (including when he out-duelled Kenny Pickett in a big win at Pittsburgh). The difference is noticeable. You can see him throw with greater confidence in the later games — he looked more in control, more comfortable and he looked every bit a quarterback capable of succeeding at the next level.\n\nHe stands tall in the pocket and his base is impressive for a young QB. He plants his feet nicely, steps into his throws and it helps him stay accurate. His passes carry strong velocity. The ball kind of flicks out of his hand on release — the throwing finger spinning it out with a little extra juice to launch downfield.\n\nHe does tend to drop his shoulder down and his release is a little more elongated than ideal. It’s not a deal-breaker but it’s something to note.\n\nHe throws into the right areas of the field, leading his receivers and playing with anticipation. Van Dyke drives the ball downfield, even when he faces pressure. His arm strength is very impressive.\n\nTwo throws stood out in a game against Virginia Tech. One flew 55 yards downfield on a dime, hitting the receiver perfectly in stride. He made it look effortless. Then he threw from his own 15-yard-line across the field to the right hand side dropping a pass into the tightest window. The cornerback had good coverage on the receiver leaving the smallest possible margin to throw to against the sideline. Van Dyke dropped it in there, giving his receiver a chance to make the grab. That was a 40-yard throw, with perfect timing, accuracy and velocity.\n\nHe’s not the most mobile quarterback (5.00 forty at SPARQ) but he can scramble away to make a first down from time to time. He’s not overly elusive or creative as a runner and it’s something he says he’s been working on.\n\nI like the way he speaks too. His interviews are a bit Belichick-y but you can’t go wrong with a quote like this about the new staff at Miami:\n\n“You can tell the difference, the discipline and intensity that has changed the program so far,” Van Dyke said. “There’s no more BS going on around here. “Always have to be on time or you’re going to face some discipline issues. [Paying attention to] small details will help us on the field. We need that standard and we’ve needed it for awhile. ”With him as the head guy, with all that talent, there no more excuses. We have the best coaching staff in college football. There are no more excuses to be 7-5, 8-4.\n\n”We’ve got to be better with discipline and details…. That’s what gets us beat. The biggest thing is player-led accountability. Me and a couple guys are doing that to make sure everybody does the right thing.”\n\nA sign that he’s seen as a big time prospect is that he’s already working with agent Drew Rosenhaus on NIL deals.\n\nThe way he was playing at the end of the season hinted at a player who could easily work himself into top-10 consideration if he continues to improve and elevate Miami.\n\nFor all the talk about Bryce Young and C.J. Stroud — it’s players like Van Dyke and Kentucky’s Will Levis that increase the excitement around the 2023 draft. And it further highlights why the Seahawks (and other teams) passed on the 2022 quarterback class with an eye towards next year.\n\nI’m seeing a number of 2023 mock emerge, many refuse to acknowledge Levis as the prospect he clearly is. Take a look at his performance against Iowa in the Citrus Bowl. Let me draw your attention to the throw at 2:16 where, under pressure, he throws perfectly on 3rd and 26 for a huge completion in between two defenders:\n\nThat’s as good a throw as you’ll see. No hesitation, anticipation, accuracy, arm strength, throws the receiver open. Perfect.\n\nHe is legit. Any early projection that doesn’t include him among the top 2023 prospect should be ignored.\n\nIf you enjoyed the draft content on Seahawks Draft Blog, please consider supporting us via Patreon (click the tab below)…"
