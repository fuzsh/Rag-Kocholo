        "text": "#1990s #AllPosts\n\nA dancing and singing Dick Van Dyke doctor twigs that a friend has been murdered…\n\nIn the second of three Diagnosis Murder TV Movies, the prognosis is a starry cast whodunnit solved by two from the van Dyke family tree.\n\n1992 CBS “The House on Sycamore Street” commercial, lugnutsoldcrap AND PHOTOS © CBS television distribution\n\nI discovered this TV movie as I was leisurely looking through the late David Warner’s filmography for his recent tribute. Up until now, I’ve only seen David in a couple of his television roles in Hart to Hart (1983) and the TV Movie, SOS Titanic (1979). I’d always known him more as a film actor and in films, but in both mediums, he proved his versatility as an actor. His films included disaster movies with a splash of romance, Titanic (1997), horror with The Omen (1976), time travel in Time After Time (1979) and a comic role in The Man With Two Brains (1983).\n\nWarner had some surprising guest star roles in much loved retro telly favourites including roles in Tales from the Crypt (1982) – with Twiggy – and a two-parter episode of Remington Steele (1983) with Brosnan, Pierce Brosnan. In his role in Hart to Hart, David Warner starred in the episode Two Harts Are Better Than One – found in Season 5 and Episode 1- where the nauseating, loved-up married Harts, now and wannabe detectives, Jonathan (Robert Wagner) and Jennifer (Stefanie Powers) remember how they met and fell in love.\n\nThis origin story flashback was done without the power of de-ageing makeup and special effects. But thankfully young actors were not involved. The Harts reminisce with a lengthy flashback to London. This judging from the fact they don’t look any younger than they look in this season implies they found the fountain of middle age at an early age. Unless plastic surgery was orchestrated for both of them by Jonathan, so Jennifer would always be the woman he fell in love with or another sappy reason.\n\nToday I’m returning to one of Warner’s TV Movies, and this was named Murder on Sycamore Street (1992) which also has a plastic surgery theme. It is the second of three TV pilot / movies for the TV series Diagnosis Murder (1993-2001). This is a TV series that I’ve never seen, but it was recommended as Realweegiemidget fodder by my Darlin Husband. He ominously described it as a detective drama-comedy series with a never-ending retro guest star list and one where “Dick Van Dyke tap dances in every episode”. Now, who could resist that description?\n\nThe TV movie’s opening theme is supercreepy and then there are shots of a house from both outside and inside. These shots set the ambience for a tale of murder most foul. I naturally assumed in my pre-series ignorance this episode would have a The X-Files (1993-2002) storyline with ghosts and other spooky happenings. I couldn’t have been more wrong.\n\nThe cast of Murder on Sycamore Street includes the snowy-haired moustached protagonist Dr Mark Sloan. Dr Sloan was played by Dick Van Dyke, aka the beloved Chitty Chitty Bang Bang (1968) patriarch and Mary Poppins (1964) mockney. Joining him in this TV movie, was the one-time leg warmers clad Fame (1982-87) regular Cynthia Gibb and guest stars include David Warner and George Hamilton. There is also support from Mariette Hartley and the tyke of Dyke.\n\nAs in a spot of casting coincidence is the mulleted Barry Van Dyke, aka Dick’s son. But before you shout “nepotism” out the window to all and sundry in a Network (1976) move, Barry does have a prolific acting career. He starred in a handful of TV series with his more famous dad and his CV also includes an impressive list of 1980s favourites.\n\nMurder on Sycamore Street begins in a strip club, as a sinister-looking man is seeing another dodgy looking-man about procuring a gun. This is instead of checking out the skimpily dressed dancers, so immediately I’m suspicious. After getting this gun, the man then shoots and leaves this man for dead. He then calls an unknown someone and tells them that he’s got the gun, and judging from the conversation, it seems he’s a hitman.\n\nHis hit is seen as he studies some photos of a man who we then discover is Dr Zach Drummond (Peter Scolari). Meanwhile, the man in the photos, Dr Drummond meets his colleague Dr Lloyd Stern (David Warner). He wants to end the partnership in their plastic surgery business. Drummond is warned literally by a Warner that he will regret it, and this is without shaking fists and expletives.\n\nThen it’s over to Dick Van Dyke. We meet him as his protagonist character, the charming and much loved Dr Mark Sloan. This apparently genial and maverick doctor teaches a room full of students and he is doc-splaining some liver condition. This is with the help of a wannabe coroner and glamorous assistant, Amanda (Cynthia Gibb). Then when he adds that the patient knows best, Dr Sloan heads to the ghettoblaster… I think – way too innocently, (it seems) – “That’s nice he’s got a wee patient case study with a patient explaining their liver condition”. Then the music starts…\n\nBut it’s surprisingly not for a dance number with Dr Sloan and the Fame actress, but it could have been. It’s much worse, as Dr Sloan then lapses into a rap about this medical condition. I kid you not. Now, this scene is much more painful than that rapping scene in Three Men and a Little Lady (1990). In this much more endearing film scene, we had three actor pin-ups of 1980s big and wee screen rapping their hearts out.\n\nSo at least your mum was happy with the choice of Tom Selleck, Steve Guttenberg and Ted Danson (in no particular order) rather than Dick (unless she’s harboured a crush on him since Divorce American Style (1967)). Then to my horror, after Dr Sloan finishes warbling this “song” his students start clapping and whooping with approval.\n\nAfter this impromptu musical number, Dr Sloan is visited by Dr Drummond. Dr Sloan thinks his one-time student – and top surgeon – looks depressed. A tidal wave of potential motives for Drummond’s untimely death later in the episode spills out as Drummond tells his tales of woe. We learn that Drummond is a plastic surgeon, hates his job and wants to leave his work partnership. He’s also in debt and his wife left him. Then in an ongoing joke, Drummond tells his one-time colleague that he should get a nose job.\n\nDespite the comment about his nose, Dr Sloan offers him a surgeon’s job, and then Drummond leaves seemingly more optimistic. Drummond almost leaves his lighter behind, then eagle-eyed Dr Sloan spots it and gives it to his friend. Watch carefully, as you will find it’s Chekov’s lighter…\n\nDr Sloan goes home and tapdances as he listens and talks to his son’s message on the answer phone… as you do. Then in the wee small hours, Dr Sloan gets a phone call from Drummond. It seems Drummond has been smoking heavily and drinking. He wants to meet Dr Sloan for lunch the next day in a restaurant with a tower… what could possibly happen?\n\nThe next day, Dr Sloan’s car has to go to the garage. So instead, he roller skates to work (instead of “maverick” doctor read “kinda irritating”)… At work, his pretty colleague / hospital administrator, Kate (Mariette Hartley) tells him that the billionaire banker, J D Gantry (George Hamilton) is donating five million dollars to the hospital. She adds that the two of them are meeting him for lunch, and she adds that Sloan also has to give a talk at the Patron’s dinner.\n\nDr Sloan meets up with Kate and Gantry, and Gantry immediately develops a bit of a crush on Kate. He’s so enamoured and distracted that he cuts his finger, but luckily Dr Sloan is on hand with a plaster. Meanwhile, Drummond has arrived at the restaurant and entered a lift at gunpoint with the hitman we met earlier.\n\nDr Sloan is naturally late to meet Drummond at the restaurant. Then once he gets there discovers that his friend jumped off the restaurant tower. Drummond’s lighter is discovered on the restaurant roof, and Sloan thinks it’s murder. Cue dramatic music.\n\nThat night, Dr Sloan Amanda go to investigate more at Drummond’s apartment. As they enter, the apartment building’s grounds, Dr Sloan is mistaken for a sing-o-gram singer by some gangster-looking types in “comic scenes”. Sloan must sing to their head honcho for his birthday… and the gangsters even join in a rendition of Danny Boy. So by now, I am wondering if Dick Van Dyke asked for a specific clause with song and dance numbers to be added to his contract for every episode.\n\nAfter this musical interlude Dr Sloan, Amanda and their colleague Jack (Stephen Caffrey) enter Drummond’s home and try and find some papers to reveal what’s going on. But the hitman is also there and he later tries to kill Amanda in a hit and run in a rental car… she’s shaken but survives and remembers all the important details.\n\nAt the funeral – while Amanda and Jack try to find more from the car rental agency – Dr Sloan spots a mysterious woman watching the funeral from afar. It’s also clear Dr Stern is disliked by Drummond’s wife and he – and she – could benefit from Drummond’s death… but would someone resort to murder? Dr Sloan certainly thinks so and tells his son, Steve (real-life son Barry Van Dyke), who is a homicide detective (of course)…\n\nThis was a great whodunnit, as although you do see the hitman at the beginning of the show, you don’t find out who employed him. This leaves at least four suspects if you always include those budding detectives…\n\nI did love watching David Warner in this enigmatic role, on first meeting Warner, he was wearing a powder blue suit that looked like he raided the Miami Vice (1984-90) costume department and very dashing he was too. As Stern, he initially sounds like a caring work partner with Warner’s dulcet tones encouraging his partner to take a day off. Then his tone of voice changes as he realises his partner’s hopes to dissolve their partnership.\n\nWarner’s character is seen as a good guy who helps Sloan and then as one with villainous motives to kill his work partner. The script alternately switches between these two possibilities when we see him with other suspects, as it is apparent that Drummond’s wife hates him and blames him for her estranged husband’s death.\n\nLater these two characters appear to have settled their differences. This led me to question the nature of their relationship before Drummond died, but as this wasn’t seen in the show I immediately discluded this motive. Yet I was totally convinced of Stern’s innocence one minute, then suspecting him the next. But there are even more twists and red herrings to come.\n\nMeanwhile, there are a few apparently irrelevant romantic storylines. Jack and Amanda seemed to be destined for the will they, won’t they romance for the whole Diagnosis Murder series. But do tell me to tell me if my hunch is right, and the series ends with their wedding and Dick van Dyke singing and tap dancing at their wedding and giving the bride away.\n\nDo pay attention to the storyline with apparently underused George Hamilton, in his apparently insignificant storyline. His millionaire character also has a will they won’t they romance with Kate. Much later it seems Dr Sloan also has a crush on her, the old dog. So does the series end with Sloan’s wedding with Kate and with Van Dyke singing and tap dancing?\n\nFinally, it must be admitted that it is pretty ingenious to see how those in-episode storylines are stitched together for the big baddie reveal. All I will say is in a double whammy, a more surprising face is revealed by this amateur detective who is right on the nose for the real killer.\n\nWeeper Rating: 0 /10\n\nHandsqueeze Rating: 🙂 🙂🙂 🙂 🙂10\n\nHulk Rating: ‎ ‎ ‎ /10\n\nCinema Shame August 2022\n\nThis film was added to my Cinema Shame post for August 2022.
