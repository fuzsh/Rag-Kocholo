        "text": "A giddy Dick Van Dyke took home his second Daytime Emmy Friday for guest-starring on Peacock’s Days of Our Lives.\n\n“I don’t believe this. I feel like I’m a spy from nighttime television!” he exclaimed from the stage. “I’m the oldest nominee in history.”\n\nVan Dyke, who won his first Daytime Emmy in 1984 for performing in a children’s program on CBS, reveled in how he had just won for playing Mystery Man/Timothy Robicheaux on Days of our Lives. “If I had known I was gonna live this long, I would have taken care of myself,” he cracked.\n\nRELATED: Daytime Emmys: Every Outstanding Drama Series Winner Back to 1974\n\nHe then told the story of how he joined the Peacock show. A friend of his approached him at the gym and suggested he join in on the fun. “I said great and it snowballed into this. I’m 98 years old. Can you believe it?”\n\nVan Dyke, who has won four Primetime Emmys, ended his time on stage by saying he loves everyone."
