        "text": "\"I don't mean to brag, I don't mean to boast, But we like hot butter on our breakfast toast.\" Rapper's Delight The Sugar Hill Gang 1979 Rapper's Delight was one of the hot songs when Bill Van Dyke and I met at the University of Maryland back in 1979. Please allow me to take a moment and boast about Bill. In addition to the many hours we spent at the library studying business - Bill was a BMOC back then. He was the President of the Interfraternity Council and likely more important - was also The Budweiser Brewing Company APAC - Bud Man on Campus as well. There are a number of lessons that we can learn from Bill. Here are three of them. 1. Have Passion. One of the Core Values of Association for Enterprise Growth is \"To Live Passionately\". Bill is passionate about many things including Barbara, his grandchildren, business, music and The Terps! He has not missed a home football tailgate in 50 years! He also claims that he invented tailgating in a parking lot before basketball games - that claim is being fact checked - I can however attest to drinking a nice bottle of Caymus in a cold, concrete garage with Bill. Whatever your passion is - embrace it and share it with others. Just ask Jeannette Lee and Tien Wong about Pickleball! 2. Stay in touch with your friends. I don't know that I have met another person who has stayed close to so many friends - from childhood, high school football, college and beyond. Just ask Lisa Miller, Barry Benz, Will Williams, Walt Williams, Robert Reed, Leigh Reed, Tom McMillen, Donald Olinger, James P. Martinko, Chris Grant, Frank Evans, G Drew Conway, Steven Abramowitz, Tim Meinhardt, Gus Kalaris, Abtin Buergari, Jeb Brown, Satya Akula, John Lynch, Bob Bodell, Tien Wong and many many others. If you are like me and have drifted from some of those people whom you have invested shared time and experiences with - consider reaching out to some old friends. 3. Be straight with people. Bill does not beat around the bush and is very straightforward. He has so many friends and business associates because people appreciate the combination of good decision making and direct communication. They trust him. You always know where things stand and what the next steps are with Bill. Uncommon in the world today. Bill has been donating his time and money to The University of Maryland since college. Congratulations to Bill and his wife Barbara for this recognition and for an incredible run that I am fortunate to be a part of! GO TERPS! #communication #university #school #passion #Terps #friends #beatduke"
