        "text": "Dutch surnames (last names) can be pretty awesome. They might not sound like anything special unless you know the language and the literal English translation of some of the names.\n\nYou probably know a Dutch surname when you hear one. Many of them begin with “van”, which means “from” or “of” in Dutch. If you’re an American, you probably know or know of someone with a “van” last name. Or you’ve at least heard of the Dick van Dyke show or Van Halen.\n\nBut not all Dutch surnames have “van” in them. There are plenty of others that are even more amazing. In this post you’ll learn all about how the Dutch got their surnames.\n\nTHE DUTCH SURNAMES\n\nHere are some examples of Dutch surnames of friends and colleagues that I knew throughout my time living in the Netherlands and their literal English translations:\n\nVan Wijk: “from the neighborhood”\n\nVan de Buurt: also means “from the neighborhood”\n\nVan de Straat: “from the street”\n\nVan Wijnbergen: “from the vineyards” (there are very few vineyards in the Netherlands so this is kind of a unique one)\n\nVan de Bergen: “from the mountains” (there are literally no mountains in the Netherlands so maybe this origins of this name traces back to people who came up from the Alps further south, but that’s pure speculation)\n\nDe Bakker: “the baker”\n\nDe Boer: “the farmer” (fun titbit, my manager at work, Mr. de Boer, absolutely loved working in his garden)\n\nOnderwater: “under water” (a lot of the Netherlands is below sea level, so flooding was pretty common)\n\nVan de Hoorn: “from the cape” (a cape like Cape Cod, not like Superman wears)\n\nVan de Heuvel: “from the hill” or “From the hills” (no mountains in the Netherlands, but there are a few hills in Linburg in the south of the country)\n\nDe Groot: “the great” or “the tall one” (tall one is very Dutch as the Dutch are in fact the tallest people in the world)\n\nNoteboom: sounds harmless but it means “nut tree”\n\nSo by now you get the hang of Dutch surnames. Not all Dutch men and women have descriptive names like this, however, I must point out. Some have just regular old names that don’t have a direct meaning. But it’s very common for a Dutch surname to be descriptive.\n\nWhat do these names all have in common, though? They all describe something about the person, usually where they are from or what they do for a living. Though obviously people with these names are not necessarily from the street or employed as bakers these days. So what gives?\n\nHOW THE DUTCH GOT THEIR SURNAMES\n\nFor generations the Dutch had no surnames. Life was much simpler back then. No IDs, no passports, no real documentation of any kind. They lived with just one given name and everything was fine. No one thought twice about it.\n\nThe story goes that the Dutch were forced to invent surnames for themselves during the Napoleonic Era, where the French leader mandated paper records of births, deaths, and marriages. For this, surnames were needed. How can you keep track of 900 people named Jan?\n\nSome historians believe that the Dutch already had surnames before the Napoleonic Era, but just never formally recorded them. Naturally, there is no evidence of this, but the theory is gaining traction in the Netherlands.\n\nMany people simply chose their last name based on where their family was from or what they did for a living. Others chose based on physical appearance (see “de Groot” from earlier).\n\nMany didn’t think that it would be a permanent thing and chose surnames that they knew were just ridiculous because they thought it was funny. So that’s how they ended up with surnames that are so hilarious these days.\n\nI imagine the conversation with Napoleon and his army going something like this:\n\nNapoleon: What is your name?\n\nDutch guy: Jan\n\nNapoleon: Jan what?\n\nDutch guy: Jan is my name\n\nNapoleon: What’s your surname?\n\nDutch guy: What’s a surname\n\nNapoleon: Your second name, your family name\n\nDutch guy: I don’t have one\n\nNapoleon: OK then make one up, you need a surname\n\nDutch guy: Ummm… I don’t know!\n\nNapoleon: Well, where are you from? What do you do for a living?\n\nDutch guy: I’m from that little neighborhood over there\n\nNapoleon: Great, your name is now Jan van de Buurt\n\nDutch guy: No, I don’t like that\n\nNapoleon: Argh, OK, then what do you do for a living?\n\nDutch guy: I make bread for the neighborhood\n\nNapoleon: Perfect! Jan de Bakker you are!\n\nJan de Bakker: lekker!\n\nIn 1811, surnames became mandatory in the Netherlands and the rest is history!\n\nInterested in exploring the Netherlands?

Many of the “van” names refer to a specific place or region, and not to a generic “hills” or “street”.\n\nAnd even more are just normal sounding last names, such as Jaansen or Henrickson. These types of surnames came from a tradition of assigning last names based on the father’s name. So someone named Wilhelm Jaansen would be Wilhelm the son of Jaan.\n\nMany people chose this method for their surname. That helps explain why not all Dutch surnames are based on a location, occupation, or physical trait.\n\nEither way, the Dutch are blessed these days with some pretty amazing surnames! So now when you meet someone with an interesting Dutch surname you can quiz them on their family history and try to figure out how they got that name."
