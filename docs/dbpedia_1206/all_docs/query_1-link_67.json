        "text": "Dick Van Dyke and Julie Andrews | Source: Getty Images | facebook.com/people/Barry-Van-Dyke\n\nDick Van Dyke made people cry with his performance on stage at the age of 97!\n\nIn his old age, the actor is a doting grandpa of seven.\n\nDick Van Dyke is one of the most well-known actors of his age. The actor became a household name and starred in the immensely popular \"Mary Poppins.\" However, he didn't start out as an actor. Dick was born in Missouri on December 13, 1925.\n\nInitially, Dick found work as a radio DJ before becoming part of a comedic mime group that performed at nightclubs. He only found success as an actor at the age of 34, when he landed a role in the hit show \"Bye Bye Birdie.\" Impressively, he earned a Tony Award for his performance.\n\nEventually, producers saw his talent and gave him his own show, titled \"The Dick Van Dyke Show,\" which ran from 1961 to 1966. Finally, he earned a spot on the silver screen with \"Mary Poppins\" and \"Chitty Chitty Bang Bang.\" Later on, he garnered a whole new slew of fans with his more mysterious TV show, \"Diagnosis: Murder.\"\n\nAll the judges expressed their joy at seeing one of their childhood heroes perform in front of them.\n\nThe 97-year-old actor is still on his feet and moving about with his 52-year-old wife, Arlene Silver. The actor has been seen out and about numerous times in recent years, and he commented, \"I'm just glad to still be here.\" The actor has also amazed fans by coming out of retirement time after time to entertain.\n\nDick Van Dyke Made People Cry with His Performance on Stage\n\nRecently, the actor has once again proved himself spry enough to make another comeback. He showed off his dance moves and his singing voice on the latest episode of The Masked Singer. When the \"Supercalifragilisticexpialidocious\" pulled off his Gnome mask, the entire panel of judges couldn't believe their eyes.\n\nDick is also the doting father of four wonderful children.\n\nAlthough the entertainer was eliminated after his rendition of Billy Holiday's \"When You're Smiling,\" the judges were overjoyed to have him on the show. When he removed the mask, Nicole Scherzinger burst into tears, and everyone else was thoroughly starstruck. The panelist commented:\n\n\"You're our childhood.\"\n\nAll the judges expressed their joy at seeing one of their childhood heroes perform in front of them. What made the occasion twice as memorable was the fact that Dick did his dance at his advanced age, once again proving his prowess and youthful spirit.\n\nOn top of the reactions from the judges, fans reacted to seeing the legendary entertainer on TV. Many Twitter users posted about the episode, saying, \"So yeah, the sight of 97 year old Dick Van Dyke singing and DANCING in front of a screaming crowd made me cheer & cry with pure joy.\"\n\nOne user shared, \"Dick Van Dyke singing Supercalifragilisticexpialidocious at 97 years old on #TheMaskedSinger is a GIFT. Legend.\" Dick also responded positively to the performance, saying he enjoyed it tremendously.\n\nHe Raised Four Talented Kids Who Followed in His Footsteps: Now He Is a Loving Grandpa of Seven\n\nDick is also the doting father of four wonderful children. The actor raised his children, Christian Van Dyke, Barry Van Dyke, Carrie Beth Van Dyke, and Stacy Van Dyke, with his first wife, Margie Willett. Unfortunately, Dick and Margie went their separate ways in 1984 when their children all left home.\n\nInitially, Christian wanted to follow in his dad's footsteps. He had a stint on \"The Dick Van Dyke Show,\" but his plans changed as he grew older. Eventually, he became a district attorney. Bary, on the other hand, has starred in numerous films, keeping the Van Dyke name in the acting industry.\n\nCarrie also made her acting debut through the \"Dick Van Dyke Show.\" Although she has earned a considerable amount through acting, she hasn't appeared in any recent films or TV shows. Like her siblings, Stacy also followed in her dad's footsteps, appearing in various TV shows over the years.\n\nDick is also a proud granddad of seven grandkids. Christian, Barry, and Carrie beth all share children with their spouses. Sadly, one of Christian and his wife's children passed away in 1987. The loving Dick devotes as much attention to his kids and grandkids as he possibly can.\n\nAfter Dick and his wife separated, the actor spent a few years alone. Luckily, he found a new love at the age of 86 with his current wife, Arlene. The pair said their vows on February 29, 2012, and have been happily married ever since. Dick commented, \"I'm tickled to death with it.\"\n\nncG1vNJzZmimlazAb63MqKSapZFjsLC5jmxnamxkanqltcKkZK%2BZnmKxurfEZqSao5WoerGxzqmjnmWTp8ZutMRmmKmolZa%2Fb7TTpqM%3D"
