        "text": "Yes, it’s true. If Richie Petrie of “The Dick Van Dyke Show” had been a real person, he could be a grandfather today (at least he would if he’d had kids while in his early 20s and his offspring produced grandchildren fairly early.) Don’t ask me why but that’s the first thing that sprang to mind when I opened an email from Hallmark Channel with this picture attached. Dick Van Dyke and his son Barry Van Dyke have been frequent costars over the years, working together on CBS’ “Diagnosis: Murder” and most recently, the “Murder 101” pics. Now Barry’s son, Shane, is getting into the family business with a guest starring role in the third entry in the “Murder 101” series, “If Wishes Were Horses,” set to bow Aug. 18. “I’ve taken nepotism about as far as it can go,” Dick Van Dyke quips…but then again maybe not. He has lots of other grandkids, though so far Barry is the only one of D.V.D’s four kids to carry a SAG card. Shane has also landed an acting gig, apart from his dad and grand-Dyke, in “Shark Swarm,” which Hallmark is promising will be a three-hour, teeth-gnashing “event” in May.\n\nPictured: A trio of Van Dykes, from left, Dick, Barry and Shane."
