        "text": "I must admit, when I made the decision to change my name, I wasn't totally\n\nprepared for always having to spell or pronounce it for everyone.\n\nIn fact, I figured out pretty darned quick that sometimes it's easier to answer\n\nto \"Karen\" or \"Tara\" - especially on the phone - just to save time.\n\nI'd only experienced a little of this when I had the name \"Tari\" because while most people\n\nsaid it correctly, they wrongly assumed I spelled it with the more common \"e\".\n\nStill, at least I was already used to not being able to find my name readily\n\navailable on a keychain, an I.D. bracelet, or even stationery, LOL.\n\nOf all the Taryns I've heard from, most of them pronounce it like I do:\n\nTARE-IN (like Karen, but with a \" T \").\n\nHowever, there are others who prefer this pronunciation:\n\nTAR-IN (Tar rhymes with Car).\n\nFinally, I even found a 4-year-old girl whose mother says her name this way:\n\nTARE-INN (accent on the 2nd syllable, like Corrinne).\n\nAn interesting factoid: the vast majority of the Taryns (etc) who've contacted me via this\n\nsite tend to hail from England, Australia, New Zealand or South Africa.\n\nAlso - believe it or not - there are quite a few boys out there with the name as well!\n\nFAMOUS NAMESAKES\n\nI discovered something else about the name TARYN while looking up\n\nthe origins and meanings: even though it appears in many different cultures and\n\nlanguages, virtually no one really famous has ever had the name.\n\nActor Barry Van Dyke (son of Dick Van Dyke) and singer Michael Bolton each have daughters\n\nnamed 'Taryn', but those Taryns aren't well known in their own right.\n\nThe three exceptions to this are actor TARAN NOAH SMITH (the youngest son on the\n\n\"Home Improvement\" TV series); actress TARYN MANNING (she starred in \"Crossroads\" with\n\nBritney Spears); and - of course - actress TARYN POWER, the daughter of legendary actor Tyrone Power."
