        "text": "A star of both stage and screen, Dick Van Dyke has endeared himself to generations of fans.\n\nVan Dyke — who has four Emmys, one Grammy and a Tony Award to his name — married Arlene Silver in 2012. During a February 2023 interview with Yahoo! Music, the Mary Poppins star joked that “having a beautiful young wife half my age to take care of me” has kept him young.\n\nPrior to his marriage to Silver, Van Dyke wed his first wife, Margie Willet, in 1948. The pair had four children: Christian, Barry, Stacy and Carrie Beth.\n\nIn addition to his real-life loves, Van Dyke also had palpable chemistry with his onscreen wife Mary Tyler Moore on the Dick Van Dyke Show, which ran from 1961 to 1966 and earned 15 Emmy Awards.\n\nKeep scrolling to see Van Dyke’s life and career in photos:"
