        "text": "Safety benefits:\n\nMDOT is suspending work and lifting traffic restrictions wherever possible this holiday weekend to ease congestion and increase safety (105 out of 174 projects).\n\nAAA estimates more than 2.6 million Michigan residents are expected to travel 50 miles or more from home during the Independence Day holiday weekend, a record for the second consecutive year.\n\nAlthough some equipment and traffic configurations will remain over the weekend, suspending construction operations improves safety for workers and motorists.\n\nRemember to buckle up, stay alert and avoid distractions at all times when driving.\n\nLANSING, Mich. - This Independence Day weekend, the Michigan Department of Transportation (MDOT) is removing lane restrictions on 60 percent of its road and bridge projects statewide to ease traffic delays for holiday travelers. AAA estimates more than 2.6 million Michigan residents are expected to travel 50 miles or more from home during the July Fourth holiday weekend, a record for the second consecutive year.\n\nBeginning at 3 p.m. Wednesday, July 3, and continuing until 6 a.m. Monday, July 8, 105 out of 174 project statewide will have lane restrictions removed. While motorists will see suspended operations in most MDOT work zones for the weekend, drivers are advised that equipment and certain traffic configurations may remain in place, like temporary shifts or shoulder closures.\n\n\"Drivers across the state know full well how much record-setting road and bridge work is happening in Michigan right now thanks to increased federal infrastructure investment from the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, as well as Gov. Gretchen Whitmer's Rebuilding Michigan program,\" said State Transportation Director Brad Wieferich. \"We've pulled back the barrels as much as we can for the holiday weekend but we couldn't do it for every project. We thank drivers for continuing to show patience behind the wheel and following all posted speed limits in work zones. Let's keep it up so everyone, including drivers, their passengers, and road workers, all make it home each and every night.\"\n\nMDOT oversees I, M, and US routes and is responsible for nearly 10,000 miles of state highways, which carry more than 50 percent of all traffic and approximately 70 percent of commercial traffic in Michigan.\n\nThe following is a list of work zones that will remain active or have lane restrictions during Independence Day weekend.
