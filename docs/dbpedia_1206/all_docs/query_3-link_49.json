        "text": "Dick Van Dyke 98 Years of Magic was released just yesterday on the CBS Television Network and is streaming on Paramount+ (via CBS News). The entertainment special honors the legend, with the actor having celebrated his 98th birthday on Dec. 13, 2023.\n\nBest known for classics like “Mary Poppins” and “Chitty Chitty Bang Bang,” the icon has contributed significantly to the arts and entertainment. The CBS special took the viewers back in time as it took place on the set of “The Dick Van Dyke Show.” It featured dance and music, complete with special guests and performances. The tribute lasted two hours, briefly touching upon his nearly century-long career (via Sports Illustrated).\n\nWith the “Bye Bye Birdie” star back in the news, many are curious about his family life. He was married to Margie Willett from 1948 to 1984 and shares four kids with her. The actor is currently married to Arlene Silver. In a 2011 interview, the proud dad noted, “They all turned out great, I’m happy to say” (via USA Today).\n\nDick Van Dyke has four kids\n\nHe has two daughters and two sons. The legendary actor’s firstborn, Christian Van Dyke, was born in 1950. He made his acting debut at only 12 years of age. Christian appeared in “The Dick Van Dyke Show” as Frankie (via People). Dick Van Dyke mentioned in a 2016 interview that his son had doubts about his second marriage but later came to accept it, telling him, “Dad, I get it.”\n\nThe actor’s second son was born on July 31, 1951. While Christian eventually decided to stay out of the spotlight, Barry Van Dyke was more interested in his father’s career. Barry and Dick have often talked about their relationship in their interviews. In a 1987 interview, Barry stated, “I’d work with him any time…the best to work with, very creative…He set a fine example” (via L.A. Times).\n\nDick and Margie next had a daughter, Stacy Van Dyke, who was born around 1955. The “Mary Poppins” star commented on his daughter’s love for acting, saying, “I’ve watched Stacy perform in school plays for years, but I never realized how good she was until we did a benefit together in Phoenix.” This was right before she made her TV debut.\n\nThe ex-couple’s youngest, Carrie Beth Van Dyke, was born in 1961. Compared to her siblings, Carrie has primarily stayed out of the spotlight."
