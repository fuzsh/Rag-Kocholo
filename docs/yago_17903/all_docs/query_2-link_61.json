        "text": "Kate Maxim enters her sixth year at the helm of the Oregon State women’s rowing program in 2022. One of the most accomplished young coaches in the country, Maxim was appointed as the head women's rowing coach on July 7, 2017.\n\n“My goal is to empower the team as they pursue their best version of themselves as students, athletes, and as members of Beaver Nation,” Maxim said. “I hope to imbue my passion for challenge and to inspire the team to be daring in their pursuit of championship level performance.”\n\nMaxim returned to Oregon State, where she served as an assistant coach from 2006-12, after spending the five years as the assistant coach/recruiting coordinator at Princeton University.\n\nMaxim's fifth season with the Beavs brought unprecedented success, as OSU finished its historic season in 14th at the 2022 NCAA Championships. At NCAAs, OSU earned a 14th place finish in both the varsity eight and second varsity eight and placed 16th in the varsity four. Maxim guided Oregon State to its second consecutive fourth place finish at the Pac-12 Championship. The Beavs totaled 23.5 points that was highlighted by fourth place finishes in the first and second varsity eights, while the varsity four crossed in fifth and the third varsity eight finished seventh. Off the water, Maxim's group had the second-most Pac-12 Conference's Spring Academic Honor Roll members among OSU teams, with 12 student-athletes achieving at least a 3.3 cumulative grade point average. Maxim guided Sierra Bishop and Muryn Greene to their second-straight Pocock All-Americans honors, as Bishop was named a second-team selection, while Greene was named honorable mention in back-to-back years.\n\nIn Maxim's fourth year in 2020-21 as head coach, she led Oregon State to its best finish at the Pac-12 Championships since 2009, earning fourth-place with 21 team points. The Beavers ended the regular season with a win over 16th-ranked Washington State, earning back the Tammy Crawford Plate for winning the varsity-8 race against the Cougars and the Jodi Winchell Cup which goes to the team that scores the most team points in the Oregon State vs. Washington State dual. Maxim helped guide Muryn Greene to Pac-12 All-Conference Team honors.\n\nHer third year at OSU was expected to bring another level of improvement for the program, until the season was canceled in mid-March after a single spring race due to the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nYear two with Maxim at the helm brought the Beavers’ V8 its first ranking since 2015 peaking at No. 16, their highest ranking since 2009. Her squad earned a fifth-place finish at Pac-12 Championships in 2019, the program’s best placing since 2009. Senior Alina Hagstrom earned Pac-12 All-Conference and CRCA All-America honors for the second year in a row, becoming the fourth rower in Oregon State history to garner All-Conference honors twice in her career, and the third Beaver rower to be named as an All-American twice. In addition, the Beavers placed 15 student-athletes on the Pac-12 All-Academic team for the second year in a row.\n\nIn her first year at OSU’s helm, Maxim set the foundation for a program on the rise. The Beavers’ Varsity 8 raced to victories in back-to-back races to open the season – at UCLA and at home against Gonzaga. Oregon State’s V8 continued to garner attention winning the B Final at the Clemson Invitational earning recognition from the regatta’s coaches as the 2018 Breakout Boat. OSU’s V8 and Varsity 4+ concluded the season with sixth place finishes at Pac-12 Championships.\n\nDuring her time away from the Willamette Valley, Maxim assisted Princeton to four Ivy League titles, including three in four years. She also led the V4+ to the NCAA Grand Final in two of three years.\n\nMaxim began her initial tenure at OSU in September of 2006, when she served as an assistant coach and director of the novice program until August of 2012. She assisted the Beavers to a top-15 NCAA finish and several top-four appearances at the Pac-12 Championships.\n\nDuring her previous stint at OSU, Maxim recruited and introduced several top level athletes to the sport of rowing through the novice squad. Many of those athletes went on to have significant impacts on the program. Among some of Maxim's novices were former Beaver and Olympian Devery Karz and former OSU assistant coach Allison Foster.\n\n“Kate was my first coach at OSU and I'm confident that she will support and push this team to the championship program we strive to be,” Foster said.\n\nMaxim was a standout rower at the University of Michigan where she earned All-America honors in 2003 and was named the school's rowing athlete of the year the same season. She helped the Wolverines to three Big Ten Conference titles.\n\nShe is a 2003 graduate of Michigan with a bachelor's degree in English and earned both university scholar and national scholar athlete honors. Maxim earned a JD Degree from the Lewis & Clark Law School in 2009, where she also worked as an assistant coach for the 2004-2006 academic years, helping the Pioneers to the NCRC Conference title in 2006.\n\nMaxim is married to former OSU rower Erik Dresser and they have a son, Leif."
