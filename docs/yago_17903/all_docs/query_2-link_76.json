It can be damnum sine injuria which means damage without legal injury. Apart from the same, the parent body after considering the material on record and need in the area has decided to open new chapter as per the recommendation of an expert professional body, the grievance made by a local chapter opposing such new chapter in the area is not justifiable at all.\"\n\nLiberal interpretations are to be made of deeds, so that the purpose may rather stand than fall; and every grant is to be taken most strongly against the grantor. A construction which reduces the statute to a futility has to be avoided. A statute or any enacting provision therein must be so construed as to make it effective and operative on the principle expressed in the maxim. A liberal construction should be put upon written instruments, so as to uphold them, if possible, and carry into effect the intention of the parties.\n\n20.\"A statute must be construed as a workable instrument. \"Ut-res-magis-valet-quam-pereat\" is a well known principle of law and on this principle the provision of a statute must be construed as to make it effective and operative. The Courts will reject that construction which will defeat the plain intention of the legislature even though, there may be some inexactitude in the language used. Reducing the legislation to futility shall be avoided and in a case where the intention of the legislature cannot be given effect to, the Court should accept the bolder construction for the purposes of bringing about an effective result.\"\n\n30.\"...promotion was granted to a particular person by the Chancellor as Principal and that order was executed and it was sought to be set aside by a later order. In those facts, it was held that although, the Chancellor has powers to revise that order but that should be done after affording an opportunity of being heard to the affected person. It was in this context that the provision as such was read down and in reading it down it was held that it includes the principle of audi alteram partem. Here, that is not the case. It is not a case of divesting rights, which revested.\"\n\n11. \"The above bedrock necessarily introduce both, 'actus reus' and 'mens rea'. 'Actus reus' is an act or conduct, where state of mind on the part of the victim is required by the definition of the crime and, 'actus reus' means state of mind. If so, that state of mind is part of the 'actus reus and, if the prosecutions are unable to prove its existence, they must fail.\"\n\n12. \"Mens rea may exist without 'actus reus' but, if there is no 'actus reus', there is no crime.\"\n\n11.\"....Should the 'mischance' of the death coming a few hours later, extinguish the heritable right which the statute recognises in the permit? That is what follows from the appellant's contentions before us. But Actus Dei Nemini Facit Injuriam -- the act of God is prejudicial to no one. Once we take the view that there is no abatement of the proceeding and the right to secure renewal does not lapse with the death of the permit holder, the objection to the recognition of the successor in possession of the vehicles as the applicant for renewal falls to the ground.\"\n\n11.\"...that the tractor driver victim invited the incident himself by towing the heavier vehicle based in essence on the maxim volenti non fit injuria deserve to fail in this case in law as well as on facts. It may be noted that such kind of defence could have been raised only if the injuries arose out of a risk in respect of which the non-applicants did not owe any duty to the claimants, or in respect of which they had fulfilled such duty as they owed. In such a situation, the action for compensation would have failed whether or not the tractor driver ran the risk voluntarily, since the truck driver had done him no wrong at all.\"\n\n14. \"These principles were over a period of time recognised in the form of Bill of Rights and Constitutions of various countries which acknowledged the Roman maxim 'Ubi Jus Ibi Remedium' i.e. every right when it is breached must be provided with a right to a remedy. Judicial pronouncements have delved and elaborated on the concept of access to justice to include among other aspects the State's obligation to make available to all its citizens the means for a just and peaceful settlement of disputes between them as to their respective legal rights.\"\n\n12. \"In the instant case the application was duly processed and scrutinised and thereafter it passed through the Sub-Committee which recommended the case of the petitioner for admission after attaining its full satisfaction regarding the eligibility of the petitioner and thereafter the Dean only on being fully satisfied allowed the petitioner to be admitted in-the course. The Maxim OMNIA PRAESUMUNTUR RITE ET DOWEE PROBETUR IN CONTRARIUM SOLENNITER ESSE ACTA, i.e. All acts are presumed to have been done rightly and regularly, applies. When acts are of official nature and went through the process of scrutiny by the official persons a presumption arises in favour of the performance of the An execution of an official act is presumed to rightly and duly performed until the contrary is proved. The official act is presumed to be done with honestly and discretion.\"\n\n37. \"Maxim Nullus commodum capere potest de injuria sua propria has a clear mandate of law that, a person who by manipulation of a process frustrates the legal rights of others, should not be permitted to take advantage of his wrong or manipulations. In the present case Respondent Nos. 2 & 3 and the appellant have acted together while disposing off the hypothecated goods, and now, they cannot be permitted to turn back to argue, that since the goods have been sold, liability cannot be fastened upon respondent Nos. 2 & 3 and in any case on the appellant.\"\n\n23. \"More so, if the initial action is not in consonance with law, the subsequent conduct of a party cannot sanctify the same. \"Subla Fundamento cedit opus\" - a foundation being removed, the superstructure falls. A person having done wrong cannot take advantage of his own wrong and plead bar of any law to frustrate the lawful trial by a competent Court. In such a case the legal maxim Nullus Commodum Capere Potest De Injuria Sua Propria applies. The persons violating the law cannot be permitted to urge that their offence cannot be subjected to inquiry, trial or investigation. Nor can a person claim any right arising out of his own wrong doing(Juri Ex Injuria Non Oritur).\"\n\n20. \"It is clear from reading of the ratio decidendi of judgment in Zee Telefilms Ltd. (supra) that firstly, it is held therein that the BCCI discharges public duties and secondly, an aggrieved party can, for this reason, seek a public law remedy against the BCCI Under Article 226 of the Constitution of India.\"\n\n21. \"Applying the aforesaid principle of law to the facts of the case in hand, we are of the considered view that the Division Bench of the High Court erred in holding that Respondent No. 1 is not subjected to the writ jurisdiction of the High Court Under Article 226 of the Constitution.\"\n\n7. \"...To determine whether a decision has \"declared law\" it cannot be said to be a law when a point is disposed of on concession and what is binding is the principle underlying a decision. A judgment of the Court has to be read in the context of questions which arose for consideration in the case in which the judgment was delivered. An \"obiter dictum\" as distinguished from a ratio decidendi is an observation by the Court on a legal question suggested in a case before it but not arising in such manner as to require a decision. Such an obiter may not have a binding precedent as the observation was unnecessary for the decision pronounced, but even though an obiter may not have a binding effect as a precedent, but it cannot be denied that it is of considerable weight...\"\n\n24. \"There is one more reason, though not a major one, for not disturbing the law settled in Antulay's case (cited supra). That decision has stood the test of time for last over 25 years and it is trite that going as per the maxim stare decisis et non quieta movere, it would be better to stand by that decision and not to disturb what is settled. This rule of interpretation was approved of by Lord Coke who suggested - \"those things which have been so often adjudged ought to rest in peace\".\"\n\n139. \"Now we deem it imperative to examine the issue of per incuriam raised by the learned Counsel for the parties. In Young v. Bristol Aeroplane Company Limited (1994) All ER 293 the House of Lords observed that 'Incuria' literally means 'carelessness'. In practice per incuriam appears to mean per ignoratium. English courts have developed this principle in relaxation of the rule of stare decisis. The 'quotable in law' is avoided and ignored if it is rendered, 'in ignoratium of a statute or other binding authority'. The same has been accepted, approved and adopted by this Court while interpreting Article 141of the Constitution which embodies the doctrine of precedents as a matter of law.\"\n\n28. \"...A prima facie case does not mean a case proved to the hilt but a case which can be said to be established if the evidence which is led in support of the same were believed. While determining whether a prima facie case had been made out the relevant consideration is whether on the evidence led it was possible to arrive at the conclusion in question and not whether that was the only conclusion which could be arrived at on that evidence.\"\n\n15. \"The applicants seems to be more vigilant about their discharge instead of complying with the directions of the Court given to them, time and again since July 2017. They are deliberately running out from participation in the criminal proceedings by adopting animus nocendi (subjective state of mind of the author of a crime, with reference to the exact knowledge of illegal content of his behaviour, and of its possible consequences) excavating technical illegal means from the provisions of the Code of Criminal Procedure under the Cr.P.C., and thus they do not deserve any sympathy from this Court.\"\n\n9. \"It is not an invariable Rule of criminal jurisprudence that the failure of the police to recover the corpus delicti will render the prosecution case doubtful entitling the Accused to acquittal on benefit of doubt. It is only one of the relevant factors to be considered along with all other attendant facts and circumstances to arrive at a finding based on reasonability and probability based on normal human prudence and behavior. In the facts and circumstances of the present case, the failure of the police to recover the dead body is not much of consequence in the absence of any explanation by the Appellant both with regard to the victim last being seen with him coupled with the recovery from his house of the belongings of the deceased.\"\n\n22. \"The Court has to keep in mind the fact that, while interpreting the provisions of a Statute, it can neither add, nor subtract even a single word. The legal maxim \"A Verbis Legis Non Est Recedendum\" means, \"From the words of law, there must be no departure\". A section is to be interpreted by reading all of its parts together, and it is not permissible, to omit any part thereof. The Court cannot proceed with the assumption that the legislature, while enacting the Statute has committed a mistake; it must proceed on the footing that the legislature intended what it has said.....\"\n\n\"The maxim 'Nemo tenetur seipsum accusare', had its origin in a protest against the inquisitorial and manifestly unjust methods of interrogating accused persons, which have long obtained in the continental system, and, until the expulsion of the Stuarts from the British throne in 1688, and the erection of additional barriers for the protection of the people against the exercise of arbitrary power, were not uncommon even in England. While the admissions or confessions of the prisoner, when voluntarily and freely made, have always ranked high in the scale of incriminating evidence, if an accused person be asked to explain his apparent connection with a crime under investigation, the ease with which the questions put to him may assume an inquisitorial character, the temptation to press the witness unduly, to browbeat him if he be timid or reluctant, to push him into a corner, and to entrap him into fatal contradictions, which is so painfully evident in many of the earlier state trials..\"\n\n17. \"...But a claim for rendition of account is not a personal claim. It is not extinguished because the party who claims an account, or the party who is called upon to account dies. The maxim \"actio personalis moritur cum persona\" - a personal action dies with the person - has a limited application. It operates in a limited class of actions ex delicto such as actions for damages for defamation, assault or other personal injuries not causing the death of the party, and in other actions where after the death of the party the relief granted could not be enjoyed or granting it would be nugatory.\"\n\nAccording to the maxim, if in a case, any undeserved or unfair advantage has been gained by a party invoking the jurisdiction of the Court, the same requires to be neutralized. In other words, no man should suffer because of the fault of the court or delay in the procedure. It is not only within the power, but a duty as well, of Court to correct its own mistakes in order to see that no party is prejudiced by a mistake of the Court.\n\n6. \"..It is not doubt true that a litigant must be vigilant and take care but where a litigant goes to Court and asks for the assistance of the Court so that his obligations under a decree might be fulfilled by him strictly, it is incumbent on the Court, if it does not leave the litigant to his own devices, to ensure that the correct information is furnished. If the Court in supplying the information makes a mistake the responsibility of the litigant, though it does not altogether cease, is at least shared by the Court. If the litigant acts on the faith of that information the Courts cannot hold him responsible for a mistake which it itself caused. There is no higher principle for the guidance of the Court than the one that no act of Courts should harm a litigant and it is the bounden duty of Courts to see that if a person is harmed by a mistake of the Court he should be restored to the position he would have occupied but for that mistake. This is aptly summed up in the maxim: Actus curiae neminem gravabit.\"\n\n\"Cessante ratione legis, cessat et ipsa lex (the reason for a law ceasing, the law itself ceases) is one of the most ancient maxims known to our law and it is constantly followed by our courts. Of this maxim it was said in Beardsley v. City of Hartford, 50 Conn. 529, 47 Am. Rep. 677, 682 (1883). This means that no law can survive the reason on which it is founded. It needs no statute to change it; it abrogates itself.\" The same thought was enunciated by Lord Coke in Milborn's Case, 7 Coke 7a (K.B. 1609): \"Ratio legis est anima legis, et mutata legis ratione, mutatur ex lex\" (the reason for a law is the soul of the law, and if the reason for a law has changed, the law is changed). \"It is revolting,\" says Mr. Justice Holmes, \"to have no better reason for a rule of law than that so it was laid down in the time of Henry IV.\"\n\n13. \"The Bench expressed the view that the Hindu female's right to maintenance is not an empty formality or an illusory claim being conceded as a matter of grace and generosity, but is a tangible right against property which flows from the spiritual relationship between the husband and the wife and is recognised and enjoined by the customary Hindu law and such a right may not be a right to property, that is, jus in rem but it is a right against property, that is, jus ad rem.\"\n\n\"It is an established principle that money directed to be employed in the purchase of realty, and realty directed to be sold and turned into money, are considered inequity as that species of property into which they are directed to be converted; and this, in whatever manner the direction is given; whether by will, or contract, marriage articles, settlement, or otherwise; and whether the money is actually deposited, or only covenanted to be paid, or whether the land is actually conveyed, or only agreed to be conveyed.\"\n\n\"I refer,' Chief Justice Shaw continued, 'only to one other passage, which serves as a key to the whole judgment. He says: 'That decantatum in our books, 'Ad quaestionem facti non respondent judices, ad quaestionem legis non respondent juratores,' literally taken, is true, for if it be demanded, what is the fact, the judge cannot answer; if be asked, what is the law in the case, the jury cannot answer it. All this tends to show that the leading thought in the opinion of Chief Justice Vaughan was that while the jury cannot answer as to the law, nor the court as to the fact, a general verdict, compounded of law and fact, of necessity determines both as to the case on trial.\"\n\n7. \"The petitioner's case is only based on equity. As because he is only short of one mark and not placed in the select list of the year 2000 against the vacancy created for the Scheduled Caste candidates, he can be easily accommodated even in 2006 as no period is fixed under the Rules for lapsing the select list. According to us, equity is not one way traffic. Equity follows law following the maxim aequitas sequitur legem. In other words, it is moving on the periphery of law and when law allows to enter, forms a zygote.\"\n\n11. \"The terms of the contract have to be construed strictly, without altering the nature of the contract as the same may affect the interests of the parties adversely. The clauses of an insurance policy have to be read as they are. Consequently, the terms of the insurance policy, that fix the responsibility of the insurance company must also be read strictly. The contract must be read as a whole and every attempt should be made to harmonise the terms thereof, keeping in mind that the Rule of contra proferentem does not apply in case of commercial contract, for the reason that a Clause in a commercial contract is bilateral and has mutually been agreed upon.\"\n\n30. \"...The further question which then arises is whether any sale of goods came into existence after the windows and the doors had been fixed on the spot ? The answer to this question must also be in the negative. The reason is that when they were so fixed, they became an accretion to the building on the principle of quicquid plantatur solo, solo cedit and the ownership thereof vested in the employer, not as a result of the contract but as the owner of the land.\"\n\n\"No proprietor has a right to use the water to the prejudice of other proprietors above or below him, unless he has a prior right to divert it, or a title to some exclusive enjoyment. He has no property in the water itself, but a simple usufruct while it passes along. Aqua currit et debet currere ut currere solebat. Though he may use the water while it runs over his land as an incident to the land, he cannot unreasonably detain it or give it another direction and he must return it to its ordinary channel when it leaves his estate.\"\n\n11. \"The rules of interpretation will not countenance the reading of section 27 into the exception created by those words. Besides such a course cannot be adopted without violating such well-known maxims applicable to the interpretation of statutes as \" expressio unius est exclusio alterius \" (the express mention of one thing implies the exclusion of another), \" Quando aliquid prohibetur, prohibetur et omne per quod devenitur ad illud \" (when anything is prohibited, everything relating to it is prohibited), and \"Quando aliquid prohibetur ex directo prohibetur et per obliquum\" (when anything is prohibited directly, it is also prohibited indirectly). Section 27 of the Evidence Ordinance should therefore be read as permitting the proof of only statements that do not fall within the prohibition in section 122 (3).\"\n\n34-A. \"As a general rule, whatever a person has power to do himself, he may do by means of an agent. This board rule is limited by the operation of the principle that a delegated authority cannot be re-delegated, delegatus non potest delegare.\"\n\n36. \"But the maxim \"delegatus non potest delegare\" must not be pushed too far. The maxim does not embody a rule of law. It indicates a rule of construction of a statute or other instrument conferring an authority.\"\n\n7. \"What is common law doctrine of priority or precedence of crown debts? Halsbury, dealing with general rights of the crown in relation to property, states where the Crown's right and that of a subject meet at one and the same time, that of the Crown is in general preferred, the rule being \"detur digniori\". Herbert Brown states - \"Quanta jus domini Regis et submit concurrent jus Regis preferred debt - Where the title of the king and the title of a subject concur, the king's title must be preferred. In this case detur digniori is the rule, where the titles of the king and of a subject concur, the king takes the whole; where the king's title and that of a subject concur, or are in conflict, the king's title is to be preferred\". This common law doctrine of priority of State's debts has been recognised by the High Courts of India as applicable in British India before 1950 and hence the doctrine has been treated as \"law in force\" within the meaning of Article 372(1) of Constitution.\"\n\n16. \"Apart from that, the intervener must be directly and legally interested in the answers to the controversies involved in the suit for specific performance of the contract for sale. In Amol v. Rasheed Tuck and Sons Ltd. [1956(1) All Eng.R 273] it has been held that a person is legally interested in the answers to the controversies only if he can satisfy the Court that it may lead to a result that will effect him legally.\"\n\n17. \"That apart, there is another principle which cannot also be forgotten. The appellant, who has filed the instant suit for specific performance of the contract for sale is dominus litis and cannot be forced to add parties against whom he does not want to fight unless it is a compulsion of the rule of law, as already discussed above.\"\n\nFor this gift to be valid, it must be made by the giver, in anticipation of his death and intended to take effect only upon his death. It must be made to the donee, either for his own use, or upon trust for another person, or for a particular purpose, e.g., the gift of a cheque upon the donor's banker is not good as a donatio mortis causa, because it is a gift which can only be made effectual by obtaining payment of it in the donor's life time and is revoked by his death. But a deposit in the Post Office Savings Bank can be subject of such a gift.\n\n7. \"The requirements of a gift in contemplation of death as laid down by Section 191 of the Indian Succession Act are:\n\n(i) the gift must be of movable property;\n\n(ii) it must be made in contemplation of death;\n\n(iii) the donor must be ill and he expects to die shortly of the illness;\n\n(iv) possession of the property should be delivered to the donee; and\n\n(v) the gift does not take effect if the donor recovers from the illness or the donee predeceases the donor.\"\n\n8. \"There is nothing new in the requirements provided under Section 191 of the Succession Act. They are similar to the constituent elements of a valid donation mortis causa. The essential conditions of a donation mortis causa may be summarised thus: For an effectual donation mortis causa three things must combine: first, the gift or donation must have been made in contemplation, though not necessarily in expectation of death; secondly, there must have been delivery to the donee of the subject matter of the gift; and thirdly the gift must be made under such circumstances as shew that the thing is to revert to the donor in case he should recover. This last requirement is sometimes put somewhat differently, and it is said that the gift must be made under circumstances shewing that it is to take effect only if the death of donor follows; it is not necessary to say which way of putting it is the better.\""
