        "text": "On this special day, we would like to bring to your attention an activity developed by the CRLDS on the eve of the Holiness of Mother Teresa, four months before this moment. On May 26, 2016, in the premises of Hotel Tirana International, in Tirana, the Center for the Study of European Policies for Regional and Local Development organized a forum on the values and importance of the figure of Mother Teresa, Gonxhe Bojaxhiu. This event was like a wake-up call when the institutional deafness to this great figure continued, to be poured out furiously after her consecration, as always as a retroactive force. This forum is part of the Center's project titled after a quote by Mother Teresa \"Heaven is in our hands\", which originated in one of the most popular sections of our Center: CRLDS Center International Lectures (CAIL). The initiative of the project, which is also the first scientific activity in our country before the consecration of Mother Teresa, was presented by Mrs. Luiza Hoxhaj, Director of CRLDS to continue with Dr. Gëzim Alpion, from the University of Birmingham, Great Britain, who delivered the public lecture: \"Mother Teresa: Challenges of studying before and after canonization\". The lecture was followed attentively by a diverse audience of students, clergy and diplomats, academics and researchers, citizens. For us as CRLDS it is a pleasure and cooperation with Dr. Alpione, known as the most important scholar in the English language on Mother Teresa, Dr. 14 countries and his views are constantly quoted by the world media in over 25 countries. Dr. Alpion believes it is important to discuss Mother Teresa and such figures with young university students as much as possible. This was the second collaboration of Dr. Gëzim Alpion with the Center for the Study of European Policies for Regional and Local Development, after the one on April 16, 2015 where he held the lecture: \"Why Albania needs public intellectuals\". This time, the public lecture, referring also to the fact that it is about a major figure like Mother Teresa, is combined with other elements such as: 1. The screening of a documentary film about the life and work of Mother Teresa, with screenwriter Mr. Petrit Rukaj and director Mr. Kujtim Gjoni; 2. The lecture of Dr. Gëzim Alpion. 3. A panel discussion with academics and clergy, who discussed different dimensions of the figure of Mother Teresa, composed of Prof. Progress Kabo, Prof.Dr. Nevila Nika, Don. Gjergj Mete and Dr. Gëzim Alpion, moderated by Luiza Hoxhaj. The picture was completed in a wonderful way with the interventions of Prof. Niko Pano and Prof. Asc Mirela Bogdani, as well as Dilpomatev Bashkim Pitarka and Kreshnik Collaku. https://lnkd.in/dRGb9Adu https://lnkd.in/dapwaPTp\n\nWhat is Beall's List and is it relevant any more? Interesting 'discussion' going on about a paper published by @uputramalaysia, and reported in @fmtoday. There are two articles you might want to take a look at: 1. (23 Jan 2024) \"UPM defends academics amid dispute over Malay maritime history\": https://lnkd.in/gDeZr58V 2. (26 Jan 2024) \"What a joke, says French historian on UPM’s defence in academic paper dispute\": https://buff.ly/3UmtfQm This item was also covered by ⭕️The Star (@staronline): https://lnkd.in/g_Zj9t7R ⭕️New Straits Times (@NST_Online): https://lnkd.in/gfFX7qFv ⭕️Malay Mail (@malaymail): https://lnkd.in/gU7Rh85D One of the issues raised is that the journal is on \"Beall's List\". If you are unsure what that is, I have published a number of articles on this. Number 1⃣ is the best one to read if you just want to know what Beall's List is. 1⃣ (2020) \"Beall's legacy in the battle against predatory publishers\": https://lnkd.in/dt2KsiXg 2⃣ (2022) \"Predatory Journals: Revisiting Beall's Research\": https://lnkd.in/dtsYGpNc 3⃣ (2023) \"Academia should stop using Beall's Lists and reviews their use in previous studies\": https://lnkd.in/g2_5qHyE"
