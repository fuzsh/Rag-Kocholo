        "text": "‘The Prologue’ by Anne Bradstreet is a subjective poem about the poet. Anne Bradstreet proclaims herself as an uprising author in the field of English Literature in this poem. A prologue introduces readers to a work of literature. It gives an idea of the overall story of the book or any comments that will help readers understand the plot easily. Likewise, in this poem, she is introducing herself to the literary circle as well as the contemporary reading public. The poet is helping the readers to know her better as a person and as an author. Her poetic words seem to be a bright specimen of what kind of an intellectual woman Anne Bradstreet was in her life.\n\nThe Prologue Anne Bradstreet\n\nTo sing of Wars, of Captains, and of Kings,Of Cities founded, Common-wealths begun,For my mean Pen are too superior things;Or how they all, or each their dates have run,Let Poets and Historians set these forth.My obscure lines shall not so dim their worth.\n\nBut when my wond’ring eyes and envious heartGreat Bartas’ sugar’d lines do but read o’er,Fool, I do grudge the Muses did not part‘Twixt him and me that over-fluent store.A Bartas can do what a Bartas willBut simple I according to my skill.\n\nFrom School-boy’s tongue no Rhet’ric we expect,Nor yet a sweet Consort from broken strings,Nor perfect beauty where’s a main defect.My foolish, broken, blemished Muse so sings,And this to mend, alas, no Art is able,‘Cause Nature made it so irreparable.\n\nNor can I, like that fluent sweet-tongued GreekWho lisp’d at first, in future times speak plain.By Art he gladly found what he did seek,A full requital of his striving pain.Art can do much, but this maxim’s most sure:A weak or wounded brain admits no cure.\n\nI am obnoxious to each carping tongueWho says my hand a needle better fits.A Poet’s Pen all scorn I should thus wrong,For such despite they cast on female wits.If what I do prove well, it won’t advance,They’ll say it’s stol’n, or else it was by chance.\n\nBut sure the antique Greeks were far more mild,Else of our Sex, why feigned they those nineAnd poesy made Calliope’s own child?So ‘mongst the rest they placed the Arts divine,But this weak knot they will full soon untie.The Greeks did nought but play the fools and lie.\n\nLet Greeks be Greeks, and Women what they are.Men have precedency and still excel;It is but vain unjustly to wage war.Men can do best, and Women know it well.Preeminence in all and each is yours;Yet grant some small acknowledgement of ours.\n\nAnd oh ye high flown quills that soar the skies,And ever with your prey still catch your praise,If e’er you deign these lowly lines your eyes,Give thyme or Parsley wreath, I ask no Bays.This mean and unrefined ore of mineWill make your glist’ring gold but more to shine.\n\nSummary\n\n‘The Prologue’ by Anne Bradstreet is an interesting analysis of the poet’s own writing abilities in comparison to those possessed by men.\n\nThe poet takes the reader should several different reasons and ways that her poetry, as a woman, is inferior to male writing. She believes, as women were taught to in her time, that she has a weaker brain. This keeps her from attempting to write on historical topics or anything of worldly importance. There are a few arguments within the poem for a woman’s ability to write but she always comes back around the placating the men who might be upset by her choice to write rather than sew.\n\nStructure\n\n‘The Prologue’ by Anne Bradstreet is an eight-stanza poem that is separated into sets of six lines, known as sestets. These sestets follow a simple rhyme scheme of ABABCC, changing end sounds from stanza to stanza. Among several other literary devices, Bradstreet makes use of iambic pentameter. This means that each line contains five sets of two beats. The first of these is unstressed and the second is stressed.\n\nLiterary Devices\n\nBradstreet makes use of several literary devices in ‘The Prologue’. These include but are not limited to, caesura, allusion, and alliteration. The first of these, caesura, occurs when a line is split in half, sometimes with punctuation, sometimes not. The use of punctuation in these moments creates a very intentional pause in the text. A reader should consider how the pause influences the rhythm of one’s reading and how it might precede an important turn or transition in the text. For example, like four of the first stanza which reads: “Or how they all, or each their dates have run”.\n\nAn allusion is an expression that’s meant to call something specific to mind without directly stating it. There are several examples throughout this poem, for instance, the reference in the second stanza to “Bartas”. This refers to the French Protestant poet Guillaume du Bartas whose poetry Bradstreet admired.\n\nAlliteration occurs when words are used in succession, or at least appear close together, and begin with the same sound. For example, “Captains” and “Common-wealths” as well as “broken, blemished” in line four of stanza four.\n\nThemes\n\n‘The Prologue’ by Anne Bradstreet presents different themes to the readers. The major theme of the poem is art. The poet celebrates the power of art in a discursive manner. She broods upon the freedom it provides to women as artists. There is also a reference to the works of French writer Bartas and Greek writers like Homer in the poem. By alluding to those writers, she glorifies the literary dignity of classical art. There is another important theme in the poem. It is equality. The poet does not directly talk about gender equality in all spheres of life. Her focus is on the issue of equality in the literary world. She wants to be recognized in the world of literature in which men dominated from the beginning.\n\nThe poet also introduces the theme of proto-feminism in the poem. Proto-feminism as the word reflects is an early form of Feminism. It is not the same as Feminism in today’s world. The tone of proto-feminists was mild and reserved. Likewise, the poet chose specific issues about the dignity of women and equality. She voices her opinion for the acceptance of female writers according to their literary merits along with the male writers of her time.\n\nElements of Feminism in The Prologue\n\n‘The Prologue’ by Anne Bradstreet is a poem often about the celebration of women writers of 17th century Europe. The poet acts as a representative of the women writers of her time. What she says in the poem is not solely her problem. It is with all the women artists of the age. They had the same literary merits as their male counterparts. Still, the laurel of recognition found a cozy went to the male writers. While thinking about it the poet somehow feels a little dejected about the patriarchal society. The tone of the poet reflects that of a proto-feminist. Her voice is mild yet forceful. The grace of her appeal reflects her literary merit. That’s why she says, “It is but vain unjustly to wage war./ Men can do best, and Women know it well.”\n\nHowever, the poet raises the issues of women. In her personal notes, she captures the mindset of society with women. The poet says, “I am obnoxious to each carping tongue/ Who says my hand a needle better fits.” In this way, she wages an indirect protest against all the prejudices that put the better half of the human race behind the curtains of their rooms. This pen of the poet wrote for those who didn’t get enough recognition for their gender. She attacks the basis of gender conception as well as the unequal treatment of women in the literary circle. Apart from that she also celebrates her womanhood in the last two lines of the poem, “This mean and unrefined ore of mine/ Will make your glist’ring gold but more to shine.”\n\nAnalysis, Stanza by Stanza\n\nStanza One\n\nTo sing of Wars, of Captains, and of Kings,\n\nOf Cities founded, Common-wealths begun,\n\nFor my mean Pen are too superior things;\n\nOr how they all, or each their dates have run,\n\nLet Poets and Historians set these forth.\n\nMy obscure lines shall not so dim their worth.\n\nIn the first stanza of ‘The Prologue,’ the poet makes use of several capital letters. Like other poets, such as Emily Dickinson, Bradstreet used capitalization in order to draw greater attention to words that she found to be the most important in a line or phrase. Most of these words are nouns, such as the case in the first stanza. The first words that she capitalizes are “Wars,” “Captains,“ and “Kings“.\n\nShe is describing how as a writer she is not going to try to attempt to write about these three important things. She adds to this by saying that she will also stay away from the beginnings of civilizations and cities. These are wide-ranging topics which at a time, were some of the most popular to write about. She says that from her pen specifically, these things are “to superior“.\n\nAs a woman, she believes that she should leave these “superior things to men. “Let poets and historian set these forth“. She believes that as a woman she is lacking something that allows men to write successfully about these historical topics. She does not go into detail about what these things are exactly.\n\nStanza Two\n\nBut when my wond’ring eyes and envious heart\n\nGreat Bartas’ sugar’d lines do but read o’er,\n\nFool, I do grudge the Muses did not part\n\n‘Twixt him and me that over-fluent store.\n\nA Bartas can do what a Bartas will\n\nBut simple I according to my skill.\n\nIn the second stanza of ‘The Prologue’, she expresses her disappointment in the fact that she was not given the same skills as other people were to write successfully about large important topics. She would like to have the ability to do justice to these periods of history that she’s interested in. She believes that the “Muses” did not give her what she needs to write successfully. The word “Muses” refers to Greek mythology and the belief that there were goddesses of the arts and sciences who bestowed abilities onto the lucky few. One person that she compares herself against is Guillaume du Bartas a French Protestant poet.\n\nBy alluding to this specific writer, the poet reveals to the reader that this is the kind of writer that she would like to be. She admires the kind of works that he completed. In the fifth and sixth lines of this stanza, the speaker says that she’s going to do what she will “according to” her “skill”.\n\nStanza Three\n\nFrom School-boy’s tongue no Rhet’ric we expect,\n\nNor yet a sweet Consort from broken strings,\n\nNor perfect beauty where’s a main defect.\n\nMy foolish, broken, blemished Muse so sings,\n\nAnd this to mend, alas, no Art is able,\n\n‘Cause Nature made it so irreparable.\n\nIn the third stanza of ‘The Prologue’ the speaker outlines how the poet is going to be contented with her own, as she believes, meager skills. Just as we don’t expect a young boy to write impressive words so too does society not expect a woman like Anne Bradstreet to write as a male poet would. here is a “main defect“ in the poet’s nature. She is a woman. This means that she is always going to have the lowest of expectations set for her. Whatever the muses gave her, it was not very much.\n\nStanza Four\n\nNor can I, like that fluent sweet-tongued Greek\n\nWho lisp’d at first, in future times speak plain.\n\nBy Art he gladly found what he did seek,\n\nA full requital of his striving pain.\n\nArt can do much, but this maxim’s most sure:\n\nA weak or wounded brain admits no cure.\n\nIn the fourth stanza of the poem, there is an allusion to Demosthenes, a Greek. He was an orator famous for having overcome a speech impediment. He “lisp’d” (an example of syncope) at first but then learned to “speak plain”. In the same way that he worked to overcome his speech impediment, Bradstreet worked to become a poet in a male-dominated world. She may see herself as less in some ways but she has made an accomplishment that shouldn’t be overlooked. The poet pushed through the “pain” just as much as he did.\n\nShe admits in the last lines of this stanza that she’s not entirely sure that the power of “Art can do much” for her. The poet returns to the idea that she is lacking in some way that this man, and other men, are not. She uses the words “weak” and “wounded” in the last line of this stanza when speaking about her own brain. This is a trouble depiction of the poet’s mind, but one that a reader should consider in full. This is how most men, and many women of her time saw themselves.\n\nStanza Five\n\nI am obnoxious to each carping tongue\n\nWho says my hand a needle better fits.\n\nA Poet’s Pen all scorn I should thus wrong,\n\nFor such despite they cast on female wits.\n\nIf what I do prove well, it won’t advance,\n\nThey’ll say it’s stol’n, or else it was by chance.\n\nShe adds in the fifth stanza of ‘The Prologue’ that she is “obnoxious” to some. There are many, as mentioned above, who don’t believe that a woman should write. They think her hand would “better fit” a sewing needle. The men who speak about her this way believe she is going to mess up poetry in some way. This isn’t something that’s specifically targeted at Bradstreet but at all women who try to step out of their predetermined roles.\n\nIf she’s successful, she knows that they’ll never admit that they were wrong. Her writing could be as good as a man’s but she’s never going to get the credit that she deserves. They will say that she was successful by “chance”.\n\nStanza Six\n\nBut sure the antique Greeks were far more mild,\n\nElse of our Sex, why feigned they those nine\n\nAnd poesy made Calliope’s own child?\n\nSo ‘mongst the rest they placed the Arts divine,\n\nBut this weak knot they will full soon untie.\n\nThe Greeks did nought but play the fools and lie.\n\nThe poet brings back in Greek mythology in the sixth stanza with a reference to the “nine” muses. She believes that the Greeks were better than today’s men in this very obvious way. They knew that women had something to give to the arts and sciences and therefore made them the muses and not men. A reader should make sure to take note of the use of enjambment in this stanza and in other stanzas that flow throughout the poem. There is a good example between the second line and the third in stanza six.\n\nThe poet believes, despite what feels like a good argument that the stronger “male” brains will “untie” it. They will soon find a way around her idea about the muses. They’ll say something like the Greeks were “fools” and liars.\n\nStanza Seven\n\nLet Greeks be Greeks, and Women what they are.\n\nMen have precedency and still excel;\n\nIt is but vain unjustly to wage war.\n\nMen can do best, and Women know it well.\n\nPreeminence in all and each is yours;\n\nYet grant some small acknowledgement of ours.\n\nJust as in the second stanza when she mentioned Bartas, Bradstreet now says that Greeks should be Greeks and women should be women. There is no way to change one’s nature. Men are going to have “precedency” and outperform their female counterparts, that’s just the way the world is, she says. She doesn’t believe a war fought to change this fact would result in anything.\n\nSpeaking directly to the men, likely those who critique her, she tells them that they are smarter. They’re always going be in charge. but, she’d like some “small acknowledgment of ours,” of women’s successes.\n\nStanza Eight\n\nAnd oh ye high flown quills that soar the skies,\n\nAnd ever with your prey still catch your praise,\n\nIf e’er you deign these lowly lines your eyes,\n\nGive thyme or Parsley wreath, I ask no Bays.\n\nThis mean and unrefined ore of mine\n\nWill make your glist’ring gold but more to shine.\n\nThere is a good example of anaphora in the first two lines of this stanza with the word “And”. This word starts both lines as the poet brings the poem to a conclusion. She uses a metaphor to call the men “high flown quills” in the first line. The poet is showing off some of her skills using techniques like internal rhyme to finish the poem off strongly.\n\nA reader should have realized by this point that this poem goes against everything the poet is actually saying within it. With these eight stanzas, she is proving the opposite of her conciliatory agreement with men. She can write, as well or better than any man of her time or any time."
