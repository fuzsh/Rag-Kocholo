        "text": "Twenty-six Men and a Girl\n\nshort story by Gorky\n\nTwenty-six Men and a Girl, short story by Maxim Gorky, published in Russian in 1899 as “Dvadtsat shest i odna” (“Twenty-six and One”). It is a psychological profile of a group of long-suffering bakers who idolize a local seamstress. Critics praised Gorky’s sympathetic tone and rhythmic prose, particularly evident in the emotional folk songs of the bakers.\n\nThe story is narrated by one of the bakers, whose only respite from misery is the daily visit of Tanya, a local girl whom the bakers gradually begin to worship. When the men learn that she has been seduced by a young man who works nearby, they revile Tanya. Her initial surprise soon gives way to anger as she upbraids the bakers for intruding upon her affairs and for making her an object of their worship. Only when she permanently takes leave of them do they realize their loss.\n\nThis article was most recently revised and updated by Adam Augustyn."
