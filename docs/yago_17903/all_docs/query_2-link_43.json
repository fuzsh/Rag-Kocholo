        "text": "Tell us how and when you got into climbing?\n\nWhen they build an artificial wall in my school, I went to see what it was and I instantly got obsessed with the sport. Later we were climbing with friends on castle ruins, walls, houses, trees and boulders in forest. I didn’t even like to use doors to go home, I rather climbed through the window or balcony.\n\nWhat do you think was the highlight of your climbing career (so far)?\n\nClimbing for almost 30 years and still being passionate as on the first day I climbed. In competition career i won the world cup in 2008. In rock I was proud of my first 9a+ and even more of all the 8c’s I have onsighted with the highlight of “Siempre Se Puede Hacer Menos” in Chulilla (Video) I’m still waiting for my first 9a OS ;)\n\nWhat are you doing when you are not climbing?\n\nLuckily there is not many days like this but I like to walk in the forest, travel, bike, walking the dog or simply relaxing in nature. At the moment most of the things I do are connected to climbing so there is not many other days.\n\nWhat is the soundtrack of your life (favorite song)?\n\nI like to listen birds in nature. Or sometimes I go to the underground caves close to my home and listen to nothing since it is the quietest place I know. And I like it.\n\nWhat stokes you most?\n\nBolting new line and enjoying in it after\n\nIf you could choose a super power, what would it be?\n\nLanding from height without getting hurt. Somehow ropes help me achieve that :-)\n\nWhat was your favorite climbing adventure?\n\nThree month long Roctrip on Balkan I made with my wife in 2014. On the way I bolted my favorite multi pitch route in Drašnice (Video) and many other cool sport routes. We were climbing almost every day and discovering new places for bouldering, sport climbing and big walls. It was fun and in the future we are planning to make even longer one ;)\n\nWhat would you be doing if you weren’t a pro climber?\n\nI would teach people how to climb and I would be setting routes in the gyms."
