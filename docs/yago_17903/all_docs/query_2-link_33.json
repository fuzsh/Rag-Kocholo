This training introduces key concepts in networking, computer systems, applications, databases, cryptography, identity and access management, cloud computing, and exploiting vulnerabilities.\n\nFor Workers and Students( Weekends Only )\n\nSlide 1\n\nCreating Career Perspective for Young Africans\n\nWe believe it is possible to equip and prepare young graduates for the new local and international job market; giving them access to valuable and affordable practical resources and training.\n\nSlide 2\n\nLearning Transformation & Training programs all over Africa\n\nMaxim Nyansa is supporting students in high schools across Africa by providing them and of course their teachers with much-needed IT infrastructure and educational software.\n\nSlide 3\n\nInternational Professional IT Certification\n\nMaxim Nyansa partners with Exin who has more than 30 years of experience in certifying the competences of over 2 million ICT-professionals,to provide professional certification to all students in Ghana and Africa.\n\nAbout Maxim Nyansa\n\nMaxim Nyansa stands for the best of two worlds. A foundation established in Ghana in 2016. We have the strength of an NGO and we are a foundation raising funds and mobilizing volunteers to train underprivileged young Africans.

Our prices for the exams are relatively low as compared to that of EXIN international itself. Maxim Nyansa Foundation does this in order to help develop young African IT starters and professionals to easily catch up with the ‘hot’ race of competition and transformation that characterizes the world’s Information Technology dynamics today.\n\nOur Impact\n\nMaxim Nyansa Foundation is a foundation established in Ghana in 2016. With our integrated approach, we support schools with our integrated learning transformation program, we create successful training programs to help young people in Africa prepare for the job market with the desired and required digital and other 21st century skills. Maxim Nyansa started its first pilot projects in a junior high school in Accra and with a group of 10 young IT graduates in 2016. Since 2017 we have been growing our work and our support base steadily. This is how far we’ve come.\n\nSCHOOL PROJECTS\n\n0 +\n\nSTUDENTS WITH ACCESS TO ICT LABS\n\n0 +\n\nIT BOOTCAMPS\n\n0\n\nTRAINERS ENGAGED\n\n0\n\nTRAINEES GRADUATED\n\n0\n\nTRAINEES IN JOBS\n\n0 +\n\nTEACHERS TRAINED\n\n0 +\n\nImpact of Our\n\nProfessional Training\n\nWhere We Are In The World\n\nMaxim Nyansa Foundation is growing and expanding to other countries.

Being in the board gives me meaning, knowing that I contribute to a better world. It also makes me richer in contacts, as I come outside my usual bubble. It makes me a richer human.\n\nKlaas\n\nBoard Netherlands\n\nI have been trained by Maxim Nyansa in 2016 and after that i have been able to make use of my skills in starting a software service for schools. I recommend Maxim Nyansa to anyone starting out and wants a the right ways to suceed.\n\nStephen Ofori\n\nTeam Lead, SKUUNI\n\nI moved from Istanbul to The Netherlands. Maxim Nyansa IT Solutions in the Netherlands (Climbing The Right Tree) is a big chance to see people around. It’s a safe place to make good things. Being here helps me to learn Dutch and to develop my skills in a non-for-profit organization.\n\nOzlem\n\nPR volunteer Netherlands\n\nThe vision and mission of Maxim Nyansa align with me and what I want to do: to create career perspectives for young Africans. Every day here is a best moment. At Maxim Nyansa, we have the principle of family. Everyone can give their ideas and together we make decisions.\n\nLinda\n\nPR volunteer Netherlands\n\nBeing here as a logistics volunteer gives me the chance to do what I love: work with computers. I can use my talents here, the most fun for me is trouble shooting. At the same time, it is great that you are a node in the chain to help creating better lives for Africans.\n\nAnonymous\n\nLogistics volunteer Netherlands\n\nI love to tinker with computers and help with the whole logistics process: from picking up hardware to process, clean and send them. Doing this gives me gratitude, nice contacts and structure for myself. It is a nice place where you are accepted and have freedom to contribute how you want.\n\nPatrick\n\nLogistics volunteer Netherlands\n\nI like to be part of Climbing The Right Tree as it is small and orderly. It is great to spend my free time this way as I love to work with my hands. The volunteer work gives me a place to talk with people and to learn even more about computers.\n\nJob\n\nLogistics volunteer Netherlands\n\nMaxim Nyansa feels for me as a real family where I got responsibility and trust. At the same time, you have freedom to volunteer how it suits you. I also did have the chance to go to Ghana and see how the process is going on there. It has been an eyeopener in my life.\n\nPim\n\nlogistics manager Netherlands\n\nBeing an intern for Maxim Nyansa gives me the opportunity to get new social contacts outside my usual bubble. I meet people from different disciplines and cultures. It opens my world view, while I can develop my professional working skills.\n\nMicha\n\nIntern Netherlands\n\nAs an intern for Maxim Nyansa, I have created an impact assessment method. I have been warmly welcomed, got in contact with experts and I contribute to a noble goal. As an intern, you also have the opportunity to go to Ghana. Unfortunately, I couldn’t go due to COVID-19.\n\nMaarten\n\nIntern Netherlands\n\nAs interns for Maxim Nyansa, we improved the inventory system by creating a ticketing system and a form. We really got responsibility, there was clear feedback and it is nice to see they make use of our work.\n\nMario and Tristan\n\nIntern Netherlands\n\nI got value and confidence when I became part of Maxim Nyansa. Maxim Nyansa helps me to show my graphic design work to the outside world. It is two-sided, they helped me and I help them. They also offered me the chance to talk to the new trainees and get them into graphic designing.\n\nGideon – Trainee 2018\n\nTrainer and PR Volunteer Ghana\n\nI have been a trainee in 2018 and the value of giving back drives me to be a trainer for Maxim Nyansa. I brought SCRUM down to the African context, by intermediating between Dutch trainers and the trainees. While working with professionals, I have a sense of belonging.\n\nElvin – Trainee 2018\n\nTrainer and PR Volunteer Ghana\n\nI joined Maxim Nyansa as I was so happy to see how much compassion they have for African students. They are helping others without expecting back. Everyday has been a wonderful experience and it is great to see a smile on kids’ faces.\n\nAmaami\n\nPR Volunteer Ghana\n\nI share the value of Maxim Nyansa: to help the vulnerable who do not have the opportunity to shine. Students are good academically, but are not pushed to grow. Maxim Nyansa gives me the platform to help people and as a logistics manager.\n\nAndrews\n\nLogistics Manager Ghana\n\nMaxim Nyansa is a big family. It is not just an organisation, it is a family where I belong. As a trainer and volunteer in the bootcamp, I got the chance to share the knowledge I gained during the bootcamp and give back.\n\nGilbert\n\nTrainee, Trainer and PR Volunteer Ghana\n\nI believe in the vision and dream of Maxim Nyansa. As a project manager and marketing manager, I have gained skills in IT and I am meeting wonderful people that push you around. I am more confidential now in managing as I have learned how to plan and propose.\n\nJohn\n\nProject and Marketing Manager Ghana\n\nAs a documentary maker I portray the impact of what Maxim Nyansa does. I have studied the trainees and their impact is great. Maxim Nyansa gives me the international experience which makes me more respected in my industry.\n\nDavid\n\nCinematographer\n\nI was selected for the second batch of trainees in 2017. It is not just an IT programme, it is a family guiding you in IT and life. The mission for underprivileged is brilliant and it was a favour to join. The training enlightened me, things were clear and I got an understanding of the practical field.\n\nJoseph\n\nTrainee 2017\n\nI joined Maxim Nyansa’s training in 2018 and since then I build my confidence and broadened my horizon in IT. They push you hard, help to achieve your dreams and transform your life to a higher level. I was empowered to launch my start-up Odwadini.\n\nSamuel\n\nTrainee 2018, Founder Odwadini\n\nAt first I was not selected for the training, but worked hard, build a small system in Java and applied again. I was interviewed, selected, and part of the 2017 batch. I learned how to communicate, especially cross-cultural. I did have the basics, but this prepared me for the career market as I am now a professional. I want others to benefit from this as well.\n\nIsaac\n\nTrainee 2017\n\nAfter my graduation in 2016, I was recruited for the first pilot program in Kumasi. I got practical experience I did not have based on what I learned at university. After the training, I established Trinity Software Centre with two mates of the program, a spin-off of Maxim Nyansa.\n\nJoseph\n\nTrainee 2016, Co-founder Trinity Software Centre\n\nI participated in the general bootcamp in 2017 and a data science bootcamp in 2018. I learned that anything is achievable, you have to know what skills are needed, and plan to get that skills. I got much confidence and see myself as unique, not just following the crowd.\n\nAseda\n\nTrainee 2017\n\nI participated in the first batch in 2016. It benefitted me a lot. I can do the work that I am doing now, thanks to the training. I gained a lot of practical experience and welcome other people, I am an ambassador now!\n\nGabriel\n\nTrainee 2016\n\nAs a trainer for Maxim Nyansa, I can carry forwards knowledge I have which can be used to improve the lives of trainees. Helping others gives me a satisfaction and it helps the trainees in their future careers.\n\nHilbrand\n\nTrainer Cyber Security\n\nTeaching for Maxim Nyansa made me realize how much I know myself and how beautiful it is to share my knowledge: knowledge is more worth if you share it. Unfortunately we could not go to Ghana due to COVID, but we bridged the distance with enthusiasm and creativity!\n\nMarijn\n\nTrainer Data Science, CapGemini\n\nTeaching the trainees during the data science bootcamp has given me satisfaction and a smile every day. I am looking forward to go to Ghana and taste the culture, as due to COVID we could not go.\n\nWillem\n\nTrainer Data Science, CapGemini\n\nTeaching together with my colleague was a useful teambuilding activity. I entered with an open attitude and it has benefitted both sides! A collaboration with Maxim Nyansa is very interesting for companies: there is little time difference and a decent infrastructure, and it is nearby.\n\nSteven\n\nTrainer SCRUM, Conclusion\n\nYou give a little and get so much back. Teaching is time-consuming, but not compared to the satisfaction. Getting a perspective and know how little it takes to help someone is extremely fulfilling on the individual level.\n\nMagdalena\n\nTrainer Cyber Security\n\nI believe in the idea to share my expertise for good causes. Much people are looking to engage in charities, but do not find a suitable organisation for their wishes. Maxim Nyansa is a charity for me where I can share my knowledge and get fulfilment.\n\nErik\n\nTrainer Data Science\n\nMaxim Nyansa creates win-win situations. The trainees are eager to learn and I can pass on what I have learned. The trip to Ghana was very valuable to us, we taught them and they taught us. We certainly got our investment back.\n\nHarm-Jan\n\nTrainer SCRUM\n\nThe goals of Maxi Nyansa transform different communities positively. Thanks to the collaboration, we are developing a branch in Burkina Faso. In the future, we can replicate it in other (Francophone) countries. I want Maxim Nyansa in the whole of Africa. Going digital creates value and opportunities.\n\nNathaniel\n\nCharity Partner Burkina Faso\n\nWe have similar goals as Maxim Nyansa. We can learn from them and they can learn from us.

Almost everyone can use their skills here.\n\nNora\n\nCharity Partner Netherlands\n\nWe are having similar activities and decided to strengthen each other. We help schools to suffice in condition needed for Maxim Nyansa to equip an ICT lab. The collaboration enables us to work on a bigger scale, we already did our 8th project with Maxim Nyansa.\n\nMacina Foundation\n\nCharity Partner Netherlands\n\nIt is in my nature to give back and being in the board of Maxim Nyansa gives me satisfaction.
