        "text": "Posted by Maxim Lando, on Apr 27, 2014\n\nIt has been so long since I updated my website, and there is so much to share! First of all, in April I was selected as one of the Lang Lang International Foundation’s five new Young Scholars representing the United States for the next few years. We were selected by Lang Lang and Gary Graffman to take part in the foundation’s mission of inspiring and educating the next generation of classical music lovers. I was so excited to hear the news!\n\nSharing the beauty of classical music with as many people as possible is my dream –especially to other kids who might not listen so much to classical music. Over the next year the Foundation is sending us to play for a number of fantastic events. I can’t wait, and I will tell you about them as they happen!\n\nRelated\n\nNo comments yet.\n\nRSS feed for comments on this post.\n\nSorry, the comment form is closed at this time."
