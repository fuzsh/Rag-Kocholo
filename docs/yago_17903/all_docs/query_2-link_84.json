        "text": "A month of quiet triumphs and stark disappointments, which takes the reader from 1942 Boston, 1939 Warsaw and 1946 Sydney to a future planet Mars and an island literally at the end of the world, encompassing the tragedy of a school shooting, the disappearance of children on two separate occasions, an insidious tale of lawyers and old books in today’s New York, a traditional English country mansion and a San Francisco straight out of Alfred Hitchcock. A most varied menu indeed!\n\nBOOK OF THE MONTH\n\nDwyer Murphy/AN HONEST LIVING (No Exit Press)\n\nNot only my Book of the Month but also my Discovery of the Month as this fascinating novel seems to have flown well under the radar in the UK so far, despite being showered by torrents of praise in the USA, and appears to have been invisible to most UK reviewers I am aware of (maybe I wasn’t the only one not to have been sent a copy by the publishers as No Exit Press bedded down in its new home at Bedford Square Press?). Dwyer Murphy is the editor of the leading CrimeReads blog, so one might have expected a debut novel that would have fitted cosily into one of crime and mystery’s mainstream strands but AN HONEST LIVING truly doesn’t fall into any traditional category. It offers subtle touches of noir, metafictional elements and a bibliophilic angle, a ghostly X-ray of contemporary New York, seemingly lackadaisical characters floating through the action like characters from a Paul Auster or Roberto Bolaño page, lawyers, writers, book dealers and, inevitably femmes fatales. I savoured every lazy paragraph, even when the plot digressed and slowed down almost to a halt to allow the atmosphere of anomie that surrounds the main character, a somewhat disaffected always nameless lawyer who coasts through life with little purpose until he is visited by a wife seeking to incriminate her older husband, a book collector, does so and finds out his client was an impersonator. When he meets the real wife, something of a reclusive writer with echoes of Donna Tartt. When Reddick, the accused errant book dealer is found dead, the plot finally coalesces and zigzags its way into a form of intrigue that reminded me strongly of Paul Auster’s initial NEW YORK TRILOGY, with its disaffected characters, reliance on dream state and coincidence, albeit with more of a straight road to a resolution. Or again, echoes of Marc Behm’s EYE OF THE BEHOLDER in its resolute insistence on subverting genre tropes. All this to say, I loved it to bits, even though the book will prove chalk and cheese to many readers more steeped into traditional crime fiction. In a way, Dwyer’s book is experimental but its asides, imagery and laconic sense of resignation connected with me strongly. Make your own mind up!\n\nAn Honest Living by Dwyer Murphy – amazon.co.uk\n\nHIGHLY RECOMMENDED\n\nDouglas Jackson/BLOOD ROSES (Canelo)\n\nSet in Warsaw from September 1939, in the very early days of Nazi occupation following the beginning of World War 2, this suspenseful serial killer novel by an experienced historical novelist transcends some of the sub-genre’s limitations and makes for a remarkable crime debut, which appears to be the first in a series. Local chief police investigator Jan Kalisz returns wounded from the defeated front to find himself demoted by the Germans who nonetheless require local staff to keep a lid on crime in the partly destroyed city and is recruited by the shadowy local resistance, a role he has to keep hidden from his family, and thus finds himself attracting scorn and ire from his compatriots, as his obvious intelligence and talent are soon noticed by the SS who think of him as a useful collaborator. But young girls are being murdered across the ruined city in horrifying circumstances, their mutilated bodies exhibited like twisted works of art by a mysterious killer whose perspective is provided in tantalising first person glimpses. As long as the crimes are perpetrated against local and Jewish women, the German authorities are barely bothered but, in a sudden escalation, a similar fate befalls the daughter of the local governor and the whole panoply of Nazi horrors is set in motion, with innocent people living on the brink of survival being arrested and executed quite mercilessly. Thanks to his contacts with what was, prior to the war, Warsaw’s criminal underworld, and urged on by the fact that his wife’s father is one of the hostages to fortune, Kalisz is compelled to investigate and soon suspects the killer is actually a member of the occupying forces and, possibly, someone he might be working with; not an outcome that endears him to his masters. Although the plot is a traditional one, what raises the novel to another level is in the atmospheric evocation of a city in the process of being systematically obliterated by the Germans and brought to life again by Jackson’s pen and a salutary reminder of the savage cruelty of a world and attitudes we hoped had been consigned by the past. Gripping stuff and a series that could develop into something impressive and a goldmine for Philip Kerr Bernie Gunther fans.\n\nBlood Roses by Douglas Jackson – amazon.co.uk\n\nThomas Mullen/THE RUMOR GAME (Abacus)\n\nFollowing on from his futuristic and glorious thriller THE BLIND SPOTS, the protean Thomas Mullen returns to hardboiled reality in a splendid tale set in Boston in 1942, involving Devon Mulvey, a Catholic FBI special agent who is reluctantly assigned to spy on suspicious clerics and preventing industrial sabotages to the war effort; a far from perfect individuals, he also dubiously is in the habit of bedding the wives of faraway soldiers in his spare time. His path intersects with that of Anna Lemire, a crusading left-wing Jewish journalist whose column, The Rumor Clinic, tries to dispel fascist propaganda, when they both become involved in the investigation of the suspicious death of a factory worker. This leads them to a cauldron of local corruption, right-wing treachery in a city of darkness where the raging war has allowed all matters of evil to bubble under the surface and poison the atmosphere and Mullen is a master at painting the fabric of evil lurking under the surface of everyday life, as he did with Atlanta in earlier more contemporary thrillers and excels in a semi-historical setting. Add complex lead characters with a ferocious dynamic both separating them and attracting them to each other, and you have a first-class page-turner, a harder than hardboiled tale of mean streets and political cum criminal conspiracies orchestrated with brio and entertainment. Stephen King loved it and who am I to contradict him?\n\nThe Rumor Game by Thomas Mullen – amazon.co.uk\n\nA.J. Finn/END OF STORY (Hemlock Press)\n\nI must confess I find it awkward to separate the man from the writer when it comes to Daniel Mallory aka A.J. Finn and be totally objective when it comes to his books. His real life antics have been the object of much reporting as opposed to gossip and I’ve been around him for many days on the occasion of two Iceland Noir festivals in succession and found his public posturing and blatant appeals for audience sympathy (among dog lovers… but then I’m not an animal person) at times grotesque although I will admit he has, in individual situations much charm and elegance. I intensely disliked his debut THE WOMAN IN THE WINDOW which I found was a terrible appropriation of Cornell Woolrich’s REAR WINDOW; but then everyone knows that I worship at the altar of Woolrich! So I tried to come to END OF STORY with as much of an open mind I could summon. OK, it’s not as bad as its predecessor, but still I found it derivative and the writing florid and forced. A young critic is summoned to a semi-gothic San Francisco mansion by a legendary and reclusive crime writer whose wife and child disappeared with no explanation some years previously and never reappeared, on the pretext of writing his biography of sorts. So far, nothing new under the sun, although Finn’s style is repetitive, always lingering on unnecessary details to try and dazzle the reader with atmosphere by shovelling descriptions of furniture, stairwells, environment, and weather seen through windows. Again the story is full of Hitchcockian tropes and situations, making it difficult to assess whether it is meant as a homage or just borrowed out of facility. The plot follows familiar tropes and is serviceable and seldom comes up with genuine surprises. It’s a decent travel read, I suppose, but it aspires to be more and fails in the process.\n\nEnd Of Story by A.J. Finn – amazon.co.uk\n\nStuart Turton/THE LAST MURDER AT THE END OF THE WORLD (Raven Books)\n\nEven though he keeps sharply dividing opinions, Stuart Turton is certainly proving a most individual talent with a propensity for far-reaching plots few other of his contemporaries would dare attempt and, most rewardingly, never repeats himself and continues surprising readers. THE SEVEN DEATHS OF EVELYN HARDCASTLE blended time travel, the fantastical and Agatha Christie-like Golden Age tropes and was a dizzying experience (in fact, too dizzy for me…) while THE DEVIL AND THE DARK WATER served up sea adventures, pirates and locked ship enigmas with bravura and aplomb. His 3rd novel once again stalks new ground altogether, and actually deserts the crime and mystery shores to occupy a fascinating blend of apocalyptic and science fictional territory. On an island in the middle of nowhere, shielded by defences against a mysterious but lethal cloud that has wiped out the rest of the world, a small group of survivors, made up of 122 labourers and 3 scientists eke out some form of livelihood along curious tribal lines, when their fragile equilibrium is shattered by the murder of one of the scientists, stabbed to death by persons unknown. To compound the problem the scientist in question was somehow responsible for the shield that protects them and in just over three days the cloud will now annihilate the island and all its inhabitants. A febrile investigation is set in motion which triggers a series of ripples that will shatter the status quo the islanders were protected by and question the whole nature of their being, revealing layers of treachery they could not have foreseen. Both a murder mystery, a coming-of-age tale and a dark saga of genetic manipulation, throughout which the answers keep on tumbling down with every new chapter in succession questioning the reader’s previous assumptions, revealing a complex plot architecture, typical of Turton’s Machiavellian imagination. Rather unique and fascinating and with a sense of unrelenting suspense.\n\nThe Last Murder at the End of the World by Stuart Turton – amazon.co.uk\n\nNatasha Pulley/THE MARS HOUSE (Gollancz)\n\nI’m a massive fan boy of Natasha Pulley’s, with every single one of her previous 5 novels finding a place in my heart, from the anachronistic fantasies of the Filigree Street books and their enigmatic watchmakers, the mind-boggling paradoxes and maritime historical adventures of THE KINGDOMS and the truly fantastical South American epic of THE BEDLAM STACKS. She is a true original with a beautiful style and an imagination in intelligent overload. THE MARS HOUSE, her first venture into outright science fiction, though, just didn’t tick my boxes. In the near future, our planet is reaping the sad rewards of centuries of neglect and man-made environmental climate change, with London underwater when the book opens, and the main protagonist, January, once a dancer with the Royal Ballet with no other skills opting to relocate as a refugee to a Mars now under the control of China and renamed Tharsis. Because he is unwilling to undergo the risky surgery to adapt his body to the planet’s gravity, a procedure to put him on a par with Mars-born citizens, he now works menial labouring tasks as an Earthstronger, the victim of anti-immigrant racism in a society minutely detailed and characterised by a subtle form of segregation. When January loses his employment in a bizarre set of circumstances following an encounter with Gale, a wealthy and charismatic politician on the up with a strong anti-Earther bias , he is soon dragged into a curious relationship with the non-binary Gale, which turns into a curious forced marriage as the two have to become allies and fight together to save the colony from an immense catastrophe despite their fundamental differences. Both a queer and ambiguous love story and a complex tale of scientific endeavour in a hostile setting, THE MARS HOUSE turns out to be a frustrating book, terribly complicated by Pulley’s determination to push her gender choices to the limit, by always referring to the charismatic Gale as ‘they’, so that we do not know whether ‘they’ actually is male or female, which made the book slow and difficult to wade through. Call me old-fashioned or sexist, but as much as I understand the rationale behind new gender attitudes, their wholesale adoption by the author just unnecessarily weighted the narrative down , and turned what had great potential into a confusing, politically correct version of Andy Weir’s THE MARTIAN.\n\nThe Mars House by Natasha Pulley – amazon.co.uk\n\nJonny Sweet/THE KELLERBY CODE (Faber & Faber)\n\nA clever and witty debut by a British actor and screen writer recently responsible for the dark comedy WICKED LITTLE LETTERS, starring Jessie Buckley and Olivia Colman. Edward comes from humble social beginnings on an estate but made it to Cambridge University on a scholarship and now works as a lowly tutor but is attracted like a magnet to the upper reaches of higher established society and is always unctuously present to help friends from that milieu, in a definite echo of Tom Ripley or the protagonist of the more recent SATLBURN psychodrama, with affluent Kellerby House standing in for the movie’s antiquated but palatial setting. Edward is ever ready to assist his friends Robert and Stanza, and visibly aspires to be accepted by their class. Robert is an actor and theatre director and Stanza a common friend but also the object of Edward’s silent unrequited desires, as she allows him to live as her tenant in her London house while Robert almost uses him as his willing valet and footstool. However when Robert and Stanza announce their engagement, the worm begins to turn as Edward at first comedically begins to stew in his frustration but then on the occasion of a visit to Kellerby, Stanza’s family estate, matters take a decidedly more sinister turn and the stage is set for a strong psychological comedy of errors and jealousy that reaches destructive levels very rapidly and changes the whole basis of the trio’s one-sided dynamic. It soon becomes apparent that meek Edward is actually profoundly damaged, well beyond the fact that he still has an imaginary friend, Plum, and the recipe for an eventful time at Kellerby begins to stew nicely. Not that new a plot, but orchestrated with style and mischief and gently satisfying.\n\nThe Kellerby Code by Jonny Sweet – amazon.co.uk\n\nAbigail Dean/DAY ONE (Hemlock Press)\n\nDean’s debut novel GIRL A was a deserved bestseller and multi-award winner and immediately installed her at the top of the league of psychological thriller-land. Which would always make her follow-up something of a precarious thing but, all in all, she has come up trumps. Beginning with the tragedy of a primary school shooting, evoked with both emotion and restraint despite its horrible reality, DAY ONE is a heartbreaker. Set in the Lake District and featuring experienced teacher Ava Ward and the trauma that keeps on affecting the families who’ve suffered from the lethal attack on a play being performed by a group of 4-year-olds. Only for a group of conspiracy theorists to arrive on the scene to cast doubts on the events and sow the seeds of doubt, generating even more grief and questions in the previously quiet but now devastated local community. Ava’s own daughter, Marty, was present when the gunman began shooting at the audience and then the stage, but Marty noticed something that might hold a clue to the truth behind the events now being denied by the ‘truthers’. led by gutter journalist Trent who now attempts to expose her. Dean evokes British village life with affection and a realistic insight into its inbuilt fractures as well as an eye for the detail of family and social interactions and skilfully balances the dreadful impact of tragedy on its reserves of friendship and compassion. But more importantly, she manages to make sense of the sheer horror such events bring to the surface but still succeeds in bringing a powerful ray of hope into the equation in subtle manner. Affecting, important and with a clever twist at its conclusion, DAY ONE is a book of great actuality and significance.\n\nDay One by Abigail Dean – amazon.co.uk\n\nTara Moss/THE WAR WIDOW (VERVE Books)\n\nCanadian-Australian author Tara Moss returns with a new, seductive series. A much underrated author whose Makedde Vanderwall novels featured a tough as nails proto-feminist hardboiled contemporary heroine (DISCLAIMER: they were published in the UK by my erstwhile Max Crime imprint), she has now travelled back to the post-WW2 historical past to highlight an equally tough but tender heroine, Billie Walker, who was a war correspondent on the European front whose photographer husband went missing and has now returned to 1946 Sydney to resurrect her late ex-cop father’s detective agency when the only writing assignments she is offered involve high society and superficial fashion. Elegant, stylish and determined (much like the author whose initial career was as an international model) Billie finds herself limited to mostly tawdry divorce cases so when the opportunity is offered to find a missing 17-year-old by his despairing mother, she jumps at the opportunity. Sydney has become a morass of inequality, poverty and corruption in the wake of the war and the streets Billie has to travel through in her quests are indeed mean. She is assisted by the young Samuel Baker, an ironic Watson to her gritty Holmes, but her feisty manners and attitude often conceal her own doubts as she progresses through underworld layers, from tawdry dance clubs, damaged war veterans and varieties of ills and unpeels the layers of a society gone rotten following the conflict that took over the whole world, only to discover there is more to the case than a missing adolescent, this much to her personal peril. The period is sumptuously evoked through her travails and Billie proves a splendid and flamboyant heroine of which we will, I have no doubt, see a lot more. Fun, action, glamour; what else can you ask for?\n\nThe War Widow by Tara Moss – amazon.co.uk\n\nImran Mahmood/FINDING SOPHIE (Raven)\n\nA leading light in the top echelons of new British-Asian crime writers, Imran Mahmood, a barrister by trade, does not unlike many of his peers directly address the legacy of Empire or matters of diversity, but has by clever stealth become one of the leading authors of psychological and legal thrillers in a busy field. His debut novel, YOU DON’T KNOW ME, was an exemplary TV series and his 3rd outing proves as compelling and suspenseful. In outward appearance Harry and Zara King enjoy the perfect marriage, but one fateful day, their daughter seventeen-year-old Sophie goes missing and six weeks later there is still no clue to her fate or whereabouts, despite a massive police enquiry, although a heavy veil of suspicion clouds the mysterious next-door neighbour at Nr 210 who refuses to open his door or speak to anyone. Harry and Zara’s marriage is soon crumbling as the existing fault lines in their relationship surface under the influence of grief and anger, a process meticulously dissected by the twin stream of the narrative. Jump ahead a year or so and we find ourselves in the heart of a trial in which many of the answers might or might not be reached, only for Mahmood to fiendishly turn the table on the reader and come up with a significant twist few will guess ahead of time. Balancing deeply-drawn parental heartbreak and incomprehension to the extent of obsession, as the couple go to all extremes to resolve the often rebellious Sophie’s absence, the novel treads an assured suspenseful itinerary that never lets go and compels the reader to keep turning the pages. Not far from a perfect read."
