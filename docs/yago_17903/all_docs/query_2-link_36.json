        "text": "Once again, with the fate of American democracy hanging in the balance, young people in Wisconsin made their votes count and their voices heard—thanks to better-than-expected turnout in the state's Supreme Court election two weeks ago. As a result, liberals now control the Wisconsin Supreme Court for the first time in 15 years.\n\nWe at Civic Influencers are proving that young people pay attention, especially to issues like abortion and voting rights. During the 2021-2022 midterm cycle, we trained, funded and deployed 21 “boots on campus” throughout Wisconsin—and over 700 on campuses in targeted districts across the country—to inspire and help their peers to vote.\n\nOur first major test in 2023: Would young people still turn up to vote in a non-federal election?\n\nThe answer is a resounding yes—and a total margin of victory of nearly 200,000 votes (or 11%).\n\nIn what will go down as the most expensive state supreme court race in U.S. history, young people helped liberal Milwaukee County circuit judge Janet Protasiewicz decisively defeat former Supreme Court Justice Dan Kelly (who was involved in the fake elector conspiracy) to secure the court’s lone open seat. For months, the race was seen as a referendum on everything from abortion rights to how the state handles redistricting—two issues that will loom large in the 2024 general election.\n\nWhile it will likely take weeks for our data to crystalize, based on the results of both the 2020 general election and the 2022 midterms, our early takeaways about young voters winning elections:\n\nInvestment in youth GOTV yields seismic results.\n\nThey care about abortion rights—and the right to vote.\n\nYoung people do not see 2023 as an “off year” for our democracy.\n\nIt will get better and easier to win in 2024.\n\nWhy do I believe this? Because the last two elections proved that the youth voting infrastructure is buoyant—even a year after a federal midterm election. Our cost for engaging young voters was a mere $1.67, and we bought no television or cable ads. It was all done through relational, peer-to-peer organizing.\n\nWhat happened in Wisconsin is hardly a flash in the political pan. It’s a full-fledged fire—one that stands to transform the American political landscape for good. And for the better.\n\nToday’s young voters are more progressive, more inclusive and more civically engaged than ever. Our organization is building and sustaining a year-round infrastructure to keep them voting in local elections and getting them registered to vote. We simply cannot let youth civic engagement infrastructure atrophy during a so-called “off year”— or any year.\n\nWe use innovative, on-the-ground data to pinpoint the communities and issues where a surge in youth-voter turnout could easily swing an election: specifically, community colleges, traditional four-year campuses, as well as trade, technical and vocational schools.\n\nDuring the 2022 midterm elections, our team of Civic Influencers helped ensure several wins by pro-democracy candidates in tight-margin races—including in several high-profile Senate and House contests (in Pennsylvania, Arizona, Georgia, Wisconsin, Michigan and elsewhere). In doing so, young people prevented the so-called “Red Tsunami” predicted by many in the media. That should give us all hope for the future.\n\nThis year, we’ve already seen a pair of encouraging results: in Wisconsin, and in the special election for VA-4, where Jennifer McClellan became the first Black congresswoman ever elected from Virginia.\n\nWe expect young people to make an even bigger impact—and swing even more elections—in 2024.\n\nConsider that 34 house races in 2022 were won by less than 1% of the vote (compared to just 4 in 2020). Similarly, the number of elections that were won by fewer than 5,000 votes jumped from seven in 2020, to 14 last year. In the case of Lauren Boebert from Colorado, the difference was a mere 546 votes.\n\nIn other words, young people have the potential to significantly swing future races—by literally hundreds of thousands of votes. Beauty school students, the marching band, the track and field team, the gospel choir: all of them are capable of winning an election. Our mission is to help them realize that power.\n\nThe Wisconsin election was further proof that empowering young voters—particularly those from historically marginalized communities—is the single-most effective way of combating antidemocratic forces in our country, while helping mitigate the dangers of a potential assault on voting rights by the U.S. Supreme Court.\n\nThe right’s growing efforts to diminish, dilute, and destabilize the voting power of young people represents the single biggest threat to our democracy. Ironically, the event that really drove home the gravity of the problem was Wisconsin’s passage of one of the country’s strictest voter-ID laws in 2016, making it difficult to use student IDs to vote—and even restricting voter registration on campus.\n\nSince then, the right has spared no expense in forcing through similarly draconian measures in states across the country. On the anniversary of January 6, this year Governor DeWine of Ohio signed into law the most restricted Voter ID law, clearly aimed at preventing young people from voting. (Civic Influencers is currently suing Ohio over this).\n\nBy restricting young people’s access to the ballot, the far right hopes to secure permanent majorities—particularly at the state and local levels. They’ve undoubtedly had some victories. Of the 291 election deniers who ran for office in 2022, an astounding 191 went on to win."
