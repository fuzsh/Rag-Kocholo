        "text": "Description\n\nThe youth club is located in Berlin-Pankow. During their ESC the volunteers will learn all different facets of children and youth work in a theoretical and practical approach. They will have several opportunities to make contact with volunteers from other youth clubs. During their daily work, they will participate in team consultations, intern and extern meetings and professional trainings. The volunteers will work in a team and be responsible for certain tasks. It is possible to choose a project on which they can focus due to their interests and talents. These projects could be: environmental projects (e.g. use of solar energy), music pedagogical projects (e.g. volunteers may organise the regular live concerts of school bands and supervise the pupils), creative offers for children and adolescents or networking between youth institutions for the organisation of a major musical event. Furthermore, it is possible to develop a project together with volunteers of other youth clubs.\n\nGisting, fæði og ferðatilhögun\n\nLocal Transport: The volunteer will receive a monthly ticket for public transportation in Berlin. Accommodation & Food: The volunteer will share a flat in Berlin with other volunteers. He or she will have his or her own room but share common areas. Food: Money for food will be provided on a monthly basis (8,20 € per day). Pocket money: will be provided on a monthly basis. It is about 152 Euro per month (5 € per day).\n\nTraining during the activity\n\nThe volunteer is going to receive support and information before the start of his/her service. In Germany, they are going to participate in mandatory seminars. This way we are ensuring that the volunteers are going to be able to make the most of their time and have the chance for rapid personal development. At the youth center, the volunteer is going to be assigned a mentor to help. Another person, working for the VJF, is helping out with bureaucratical hurdles and problems that may occur in the working environment.\n\nParticipant profile\n\nAs a volunteer at Maxim, it is an advantage to have a good knowledge of German, good skills in written and spoken English, as well as some computer skills including Microsoft Office. Working at Maxim requires a teamwork spirit as well as the ability to work independently. Maxim welcomes motivated, flexible, friendly, curious and self-confident volunteers with good communication skills and a sense of humour. Gender, nationality, religion, political and sexual orientation are not considered in the selection process, the volunteers are chosen regarding their abilities, experiences, interests."
