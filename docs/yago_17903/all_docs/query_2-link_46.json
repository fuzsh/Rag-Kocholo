        "text": "He went on to serve his country proudly in the United States Air Force, and afterward worked for many years as a technician and systems engineer for IBM until his retirement. He married his late wife, Tyrene Rogers, on May 7, 1982.\n\nPaul will be lovingly remembered and dearly missed by his children, Casey (Billy), Lea (Erik), Paul (Daniela) and Christina (Michael). He will also be fondly remembered by his six grandchildren, Michaela, Kyle, Quincy, Madison, Walter and Lyla; his three step-grandchildren, Jessica, Samantha (Jack) and Connor; as well as his first wife, Bonita. The loss of Paul creates an immense void in the lives of those he loved. His family will always cherish the memory of a gentle soul who gave selflessly to all around him. Paul successfully lived by the maxim that his mother gave to him when he was young: leave every room better than how you found it.\n\nPaul was preceded in death by his beloved wife of 35 years, Tyrene; his parents, Thomas and Arletta Rogers; his brothers and sisters, Tom, Laurel, Faye, Jim and William; and his granddaughter, Marissa.\n\nPaul’s family would like to extend their sincere gratitude to the staff of the Cotter House in Worthington for their exemplary care of Paul at the end of his life.\n\nA prayer service for Paul will take place 3:30 to 4:15 p.m. Sunday, Aug. 11, 2024, at Woodworth Church of the Brethren, 30 E. Western Reserve Road in Poland. Afterward, friends and family will gather for a celebration of Paul’s life, 5:30 to 8:30 p.m., at the Thomas C. Masters Pavilion in Boardman Park, 375 Boardman-Poland Road in Boardman.\n\nMemorial donations may be made to the Air Force Aid Society, Attn: Development Department, 1550 Crystal Drive, Suite 809, Arlington, VA 22202.\n\nArrangements are being handled by Cunningham-Becker Funeral Home, Poland. Online condolences may be made at www.beckerobits.com.\n\n(special notice)"
