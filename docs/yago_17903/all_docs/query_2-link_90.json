        "text": "Written by VON ULRICH SCHMID\n\ntranslated by David Grunwald\n\nIn the summer of 1929 Maxim Gorky traveled to the Solovetsky Islands in the White Sea. The Solovetsky Special Affairs Camp was located there – a Gulag camp complex whose inmates performed forced labor. It was rumored that the prisoner’s living conditions were miserable: Torture, mistreatment and murders were part of everyday life. The state had organized the visit of the famous writer Gorky to improve the precarious reputation of the Soviet penal system.\n\nThe camp was well prepared. The dungeons on Sekirnaya Gora were staged: tables were set up, and the prisoners received newspapers and were asked to pretend they were reading. In order to signal to Gorky that it was staged, the prisoners held the newspapers wrongly in their hands. “Gorky saw it. He turned the newspaper over to one of them and walked away. He showed that he had understood everything ”- later recalled the famous philologist Dimitri Likhachev, who was also imprisoned on the islands (Solovetsky Islands) as a young man.\n\nDecades later, the Russian writer Boris Akunin said that Gorky had “spoiled his obituary” with this trip. The writer, who was considered a symbol of justice, wrote a eulogy in Solovki where he praised the nice barracks of the prisoners, and praised the NKVD and sang the praises of socialist construction.\n\nGorky’s paradox was that he was committed to the underprivileged of society throughout his life and, at the same time, in the last years of his life, he became a complicit accomplice of the repressive Stalinist system. A rose-colored protest was the basic gesture of his writing. However, his multi-layered work was reduced to a catchy political message through canonization in the Soviet literary scene and must therefore be reevaluated.\n\nMaxim Gorky was born under the name Alexej Maximowitsch Peschkow in 1868 in Nizhni Novgorod. He came from the simplest of backgrounds and acquired his literary skills largely as a self-taught writer. His difficult youth brought him into contact with many milieus. He traveled through the south of the tsarist empire and eventually settled in Samara as a journalist. When he was 19, he shot himself in the chest with a pistol. This suicide attempt had lifelong consequences for the health of his lungs.\n\nAt the turn of the century, Gorky quickly became famous as the author of simple romantic stories. He was able to draw on his own experience as a migrant worker and day laborer. In the early texts, Gorky succeeded in combining ethnographic observations with romantic subjects. Some of them were later transfigured into allegories of the revolutionary struggle. For example, in the story The old Isergil (1894) a young man tears his blazing heart out of his chest to show his own people the right way.\n\nLATER\n\nSoon Gorky also celebrated success on the stage with his socially critical dramas. In contrast to the narratives, a strictly naturalistic willingness prevails in the plays. The impression was reinforced by the hyper-realistic productions by star director Konstantin Stanislawski at the Moscow Art Theater. However, Gorki’s most famous drama Night Asylum (1902) also shows his romantic pathos. In a monologue, the sentence “A person – how proud that sounds!” This expression has become a household word in Russian.\n\nThe tsarist authorities also noticed the explosive political nature of Gorky’s stories. When Tsar Nicholas II withheld an honorary membership in the Academy of Sciences from the successful young author, authors Anton Chekhov and Vladimir Korolenko resigned in protest. After a brief arrest, Gorky traveled to the USA and lived in exile on Capri from 1907 to 1913. The first literary publications appeared under the pseudonym Maxim Gorki (English translation “The Bitter”) – the author used this nom de Plume throughout his life.\n\nStalin utilized Gorky for his political goals.\n\nCONFLICTED RELATIONSHIP WITH LENIN\n\nStalin coopted Gorky for his political goals. Even before his exile on Capri, he met Lenin in 1905, with whom he later had a conflict-ridden relationship. One particular point of contention related to religion, which Gorky has always considered to be of central importance. With his confession (1908), which followed Tolstoy’s example under different circumstances, Gorky reached the height of his belief in Russian Marxism. The philosopher and biologist Alexander Bogdanow (1873–1928), to whom Gorky also owed his rudimentary Marxist education, had designed this program: God was not a metaphysical being, but a human construct that had to become an object of religious worship. The strictly atheist Lenin reacted spitefully to Bogdanov’s ideas: The constructed god differed from the Christian god like a yellow devil from a blue devil.[1] Gorky soon gave up communalism, but remained a supporter of Bogdanov’s idea that the new communist civilization also accumulated the spiritual energy of all the deceased and it flowed back into the new society through the spirit of individual geniuses.[2]\n\nGorky rubbed against Lenin’s moral ruthlessness for a long time. After the October Revolution, the writer harshly criticized the cruelty of the Bolshevik rule and made Lenin personally responsible for the excesses of violence.[3] Gorky’s series of articles published at the beginning of 1918 under the title Untimely Thoughts in the newspaper Novaya Shisn (Eng. “New Life”), was kept strictly under lock and key in the Soviet Union. Lenin sent the inconvenient Gorky into exile a second time in 1921 “for recreation”, first to Germany, then to Italy. It was only much later that Gorky’s view of the revolutionary leader changed: in the writer’s late memory, the ruthless tyrant became a caring teacher.\n\nIN THE GOLDEN CAGE\n\nIn 1928 Gorky return to the Soviet state in a triumphal procession. Stalin, who had just consolidated his power as Lenin’s successor, gave the famous writer an exuberant reception. Stalin wanted to legitimize his own rule with Gorky’s moral authority. The celebrated author resided in a Moscow villa like in a golden cage and was supplied with manipulated information. He threw himself into extensive editing projects, founded the Weltliteratur publishing house and initiated a series with biographies of famous people, which is continued to this day. He was showered with awards. Even his hometown of Nizhny Novgorod was renamed Gorky in his honor in 1932.\n\nStalin utilized Gorky for his own political ends, and Gorky was willingly instrumentalized. He supported the dictatorship with newspaper articles with martial titles such as “if the enemy does not surrender, he will be destroyed” (1930). In 1934 Gorky reached a low point in his literary career when he gave the opening speech at the First Writers’ Congress. Previously, all literary associations had been dissolved and brought into the party line. The only accepted style was socialist realism, which was supposed to represent “reality in its revolutionary development”. Gorky’s novel Mother (1906), in which a revolutionary circle is portrayed from the naive point of view of the hero’s uneducated mother, was regarded as a model of avant la lettre. In a precarious sense, this novel anticipates the problems of the Soviet literary business: In the new society, ideological content does not have to be understood at all, it is sufficient that the author’s control of sympathy elevates the right people into positive heroes.\n\nThe propaganda anthology The White Sea-Baltic Canal was also created in 1934. Because many were unable to cope with the rigors of the camp, more than 100,000 people perished at the large construction site of this artificial waterway, which was created through forced labor. In the preface, Gorky praised Stalin’s “excellently organized will”, “highly theoretical understanding” and “merciless, combative action” against his opponents. However, one should not prematurely interpret Gorky’s restricted gaze as a result of political naivete. Much more likely, he made a show of will to support the forcible construction of socialism at all costs. He was even ready to turn a blind eye to the precarious Soviet reality. He was still in contact with representatives of the liberal exile community in Western Europe. One of them was Jekaterina Kuskowa, who worked in Prague for a democratic rebirth of Russia. In a 1929 letter, Gorky warned Kuskova “to confuse and blind the people with the poisonous, deadly dust of flat everyday truths. […] You may call me an optimist, an idealist, a romantic … That is your business. Mine is to explain why I have now become one-sided.”[4]\n\nThis self-chosen blind pragmatism also determined Gorki’s relationship with Stalin. After all, the writer refused to allow the dictator to write an embellished biography.[5] Rumors persist that Gorky was murdered on the orders of Stalin in 1936. The only striking thing is the time of death: Gorky died a year before the start of the Great Terror – Stalin could have feared a similar protest from Gorky as after Lenin’s seizure of power.[6] However, Gorky, who had previously expressed his own sentimentality and sentimentality to the public, had long since been compromised by his unreserved support of the Kremlin ruler.\n\nTHE SOVIET CANONIZATION\n\nGorky’s fame largely rests on his early romantic narratives and his socially critical plays. His magnum opus, the biographical epic The Life of Klim Samgin (1927-1937), has not received much notice in either Russia or the West. Gorky’s own first name sounds anagrammatic in the name of the title character. However, Gorky did not draft a fictional autobiography, as the first Russian Nobel Prize winner Ivan Bunin had done in The Life of Arsenyev (1933), but an alternative autobiography in the form of a bourgeois intellectual who collapses under the weight of possible models of society. In the official Soviet criticism, the book was interpreted as a declaration of bankruptcy of bourgeois thought. However, the text has many more levels of meaning, ranging from the subtle psychodrama to the interrelationship between the individual and society.\n\nThe fact that Gorky and his work have not yet been completely covered in the dust of Soviet canonization is shown by a new, very sophisticated literary portal that has taken the name of Gorky.\n\n[1] Fülöp-Miller, René (1926): Geist und Gesicht des Bolschewismus, S. 102\n\n[2] Petrov, Petre (2018): Gorky’s return and the energetics of Soviet socialism, in: Studies in East European Thought 70/2018, S. 41-60\n\n[3] Knigge, Armin (2011): „Ich liebte ihn im Zorn“ – Gorki über Lenin\n\n[4] Wolfe, Bertram D.
