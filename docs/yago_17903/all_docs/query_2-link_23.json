        "text": "Living with a developmental challenge or disability can present unique obstacles for individuals and their families. It is a journey that requires support, resources and guidance to navigate effectively. At Maxim Healthcare Services, we understand the importance of providing quality services and personalized care to those in need. That’s why we’ve partnered with California Regional Centers across the state to offer support for individuals with developmental disabilities and their families.\n\nIn this blog post, we will explore how Maxim and California Regional Centers work together to help patients achieve their full potential while navigating the challenges of developmental disabilities.\n\nCalifornia Regional Centers\n\nThe California Regional Centers are a statewide network of community-based, non-profit agencies contracted to the California Department of Development Services (DDS) to support individuals with developmental disabilities and their families. According to the DDS, regional centers provide assessments, determine eligibility for services and offer case management services. They also develop, purchase and coordinate the services in Individual Program Plans.\n\nThere are 21 regional centers, with more than 40 offices, serving the entire state of California. Use the DDS Regional Center Lookup tool to determine which regional center serves your area.\n\nTo be eligible for services through the California Regional Centers, an individual must have a disability that begins before the person’s 18th birthday that is expected to continue indefinitely and present a substantial disability throughout their lives. Infants and toddlers aged 0 through 36 months who are at risk of having a developmental disability or already have a delay may also qualify for services.\n\nMaxim’s programs\n\nSince 2004, Maxim Healthcare Services has partnered with the California Regional Centers to support individuals with developmental disabilities and related conditions, including cerebral palsy, intellectual disabilities, autism and epilepsy. We serve adults and children, depending on their needs and family situation.\n\nOur Maxim offices in California provide a range of services through the regional centers, including:\n\nPersonal assistance programs\n\nSpecially designed for people transitioning into adulthood and older individuals, our personal assistance program assigns a qualified and compassionate caregiver to help clients perform various daily tasks and access their communities. These services are tailored to meet our client’s needs and are available 24/7, including weekends and holidays.\n\nPersonal assistants can help with:\n\nAttending appointments and events\n\nShopping and errands\n\nAttending college and after-school programs\n\nAssistance with personal and pet care\n\nStand-by assistance with walking and transfers\n\nMedication, appointment and routine reminders\n\nMeal preparation and feeding\n\nSitter services (in-home or facility)\n\nIn-home respite program\n\nWe understand that family caregivers often feel stressed and overwhelmed while caring for a loved one with a developmental disability. Our respite program lets families take a break knowing that their child is being cared for in the familiarity of home. Maxim’s screened and trained caregivers can be scheduled at the parent’s request. This is sometimes known as ‘agency respite’ although it may vary based on the regional center. Contact your local regional center for more details.\n\nSome families prefer to have someone they already know, such as a neighbor, friend, or relative, provide respite care authorized by the Regional Center – sometimes known Employer of Record (EOR) or family-select respite. Maxim can expedite the hiring process for those individuals so the family’s person of choice can be a paid respite caregiver.\n\nHomemaker program\n\nOur homemaker program helps safeguard individuals in their homes by assisting with daily living, personal care and home maintenance tasks – ensuring that elderly or disabled individuals can maintain peace of mind and an independent lifestyle.\n\nIntensive behavior support\n\nOur innovative intensive behavior support program provides respite relief to primary caregivers of individuals with challenging behaviors. Unlike traditional behavioral respite, our IBS services use applied behavioral analysis strategies to reduce problem behaviors and improve communication and self-help skills.\n\nA board-certified behavior analyst designs a care plan for each client and performs regular supervisory visits with all direct care staff to ensure the safety and success of our client and team. Our thoughtful approach has allowed us to provide services to families that have been unsuccessful with other programs.\n\nABA services\n\nMaxim’s applied behavioral analysis (ABA) therapy uses a flexible-empathy-based approach consisting of psychological, educational and developmental techniques specifically tailored to the needs of the individual.\n\nStudies have shown that ABA techniques are a proven treatment method for individuals with autism spectrum disorder at any level. Our board-certified behavior analysts and behavior technicians use evidence-based practices to assist with adaptive skills, independence, language skills, play and socialization. They also work to minimize challenging or risky behaviors.\n\nCoordinated family support\n\nCoordinated family support (CFS) is a new service option, specifically designed for adult consumers who live in their family homes. It focuses on improving access to services, generic resources and supports. Our CFS specialists help consumers navigate the process of scheduling providers and applying for programs such as Supplemental Security Income (SSI), Medi-Cal, Access, Section 8 hours, CalFresh, CalABLE – and other resources that improve their use of services. CFS is tailored to the unique needs of each individual and provided in preferred language.\n\nIn addition, Maxim has a variety of specialty programs in California designed to meet each family’s unique needs. To learn more about programs available in your area, please contact your local Maxim office or your Regional Center’s service coordinator.\n\nMaking a difference in our communities\n\nThrough the programs listed above, Maxim can make a significant difference in the lives of people in our California communities. Here are some stories from the teams in our offices:\n\nSan Bernardino Team:\n\nA client who struggles with outbursts due to schizophrenia and self-harm had to be admitted to the psych ward and subsequently missed a week of school. The Maxim personal assistant assigned to his case assured the family they would help the student get caught up. The assistant spoke to the client’s professor and helped the client explain his situation. The professor was understanding and gave the client the opportunity to catch up. Thanks to their Maxim personal assistant’s support, the client could pass their class!\n\nOrange County Team:\n\nFor many years, we have worked with Integrity House and Harbor House, two adult day programs here in Orange County. Upon completing adult transitional school, many young adults with disabilities don’t have plans if they are not entering the workforce. Programs like Integrity House and Harbor House allow individuals with various physical and intellectual disabilities to be in a social setting while working to fulfill their potential.\n\nBoth programs have a clubhouse model, which promotes their participants’ independence and allows them to be heavily involved in the decision-making process regarding operations and program activities. Our Orange County Companion team has established long-lasting partnerships with both programs, allowing us to provide 1:1 assistance for nineteen individuals with varying disabilities and needs.\n\nThese individuals are able to attend these programs Monday through Friday because of our caregivers. The care ranges for each participant, but many of them require full assistance with their Activities of Daily Living (ADLs). They would not be able to attend these programs without an aid and, unfortunately, be stuck at home. While our aids assist with personal care, they also assist the participants in reaching various goals they set to help them reach their full potential."
