        "text": "1 Introduction\n\nXBRL International's Currency and Country Taxonomies represent ISO currency and country codes which implementers can reference in their taxonomies.\n\nISO Currency and Country codes are commonly used in XBRL reports worldwide. These codes are used in reports for a variety of reasons, including to:\n\nspecify the measurement currency for monetary values;\n\nqualify exposure breakdowns into currency or country buckets; and\n\nidentify the country of counterparties and related parties\n\nThis taxonomy guide discusses the following aspects of the currency and country taxonomies, including:\n\nThe architecture of the taxonomies\n\nDevelopment and maintenance plan\n\nMapping of source ISO XML files to taxonomy artefacts\n\n2 ISO Currency and Country Codes\n\nThe International Organization for Standardization (ISO) maintains the standard for currency and country representations. ISO, in turn, appoints a Maintenance Authority (MA) to maintain the resulting code lists. These code lists are freely available in digital form and are an important set of lists used to avoid confusion when referring to currencies or countries. The ISO code lists are particularly focused on ISO2022 messages and similar transactional uses of the codes. They are updated promptly by the MA.\n\n2.1 ISO Currency Code\n\nISO 4217 specifies the structure for a three-letter alphabetic code and an equivalent three-digit numeric code to represent currencies. SIX Financial Information AG is the official Maintenance Agency of currency codes under ISO 4217. SIX maintains the currency code lists, updates them, and makes them available online. The codes in ISO 4217 can be accessed here.\n\n2.2 ISO Country Code\n\nISO 3166 provides universally applicable coded representations of names of countries (current and non-current), dependencies, and other areas of geopolitical interest and their subdivisions. The ISO central secretariat itself is the Maintenance Agency (ISO 3166/MA) for this standard and updates, maintains, and publishes changes to the country codes. The codes in ISO 3166 can be accessed on their Online Browsing Platform.\n\n3 Taxonomy Content\n\nThe taxonomies define currency and country ISO codes as domain members. The domain members are associated with labels and references.\n\nTaxonomies importing the currency and country taxonomies can use the currency and country codes as domain members in a dimensional breakdown or as enumeration values.\n\n4 Taxonomy Structure\n\n4.1 Currency Taxonomy Structure\n\nThe currency taxonomy contains the following two entry points:\n\ncurrency: Entry point to access currency codes as domain members for taxonomy authors wanting to use just the currency list dimensionally or as enumeration values in their own concepts (i.e., drop-down lists). This entry point does not contain labels for currency names and provides flexibility to provide specific currency names in any language.\n\ncurrency-en: This entry point includes all taxonomy components of the 'currency' entry point and provides English labels for currency names.\n\nFigure 1 sets out the logical structure of the currency taxonomy.\n\ncurrency – The entry point includes the following components.\n\ncurrency-elts – schema definition for currency codes as domain members\n\ncurrency-definition – defines domain-member hierarchy for currency codes\n\ncurrency-label-code – specifies alpha and numeric codes for currencies. The labels use custom label roles defined in role-label-code.\n\ncurrency-reference – specifies references for currency codes. Property references with custom parts defined in property-part are used for deprecated codes.\n\ncurrency-en – Entry point imports ‘currency’ and includes the English labels for currency codes.\n\ncurrency-label-en – specifies currency name in English as provided by ISO. The documentation label specifies the associated geography entity(ies) for the currency as defined by ISO\n\nAdditional language labels can be contributed as a modular extension to the taxonomy as shown by the currency-label-fr example.\n\n4.2 Country Taxonomy Structure\n\nThe country taxonomy contains the following two entry points:\n\ncountry: Entry point to access country codes as domain members for taxonomy authors wanting to use just the country list dimensionally or as enumeration values in their own concepts (i.e., drop-down lists). This entry point does not contain labels for country names and provides flexibility to specific country names in any language.\n\ncountry-en: This entry point includes all taxonomy components of the 'country' entry point and provides English labels for country names.\n\nFigure 2 sets out the logical structure of the country taxonomy.\n\ncountry – The entry point includes the following components:\n\ncountry-elts – schema definition for country codes as domain members\n\ncountry-definition – defines domain-member hierarchy for country codes\n\ncountry-label-code – specifies alpha and numeric codes for countries. The labels use custom label roles defined in label-code-role.\n\ncountry-reference – specifies references for country codes. Property references with custom parts defined in property-part are used for deprecated codes.\n\ncountry-en – Entry point imports ’country’ and includes the English labels for country codes.\n\ncountry-label-en – specifies country labels (short name + full name) in English as provided by ISO.\n\nAdditional language labels can be added as a modular extension to the taxonomy as shown by the country-label-fr example.\n\n5 Deprecation\n\n5.1 Currency Codes Deprecation\n\nHistorical currencies are available in list three of the ISO 4217 standard. The currency taxonomy will also include historical codes to facilitate reporting using historical codes (if required). For such historical currency codes:\n\nThe standard label has the withdrawal date in parentheses to indicate the code was valid before the specified date. For example, the standard label for ‘AFA’ is ‘Afghani (before 2003-01)’ .\n\nThe following additional metadata is attached using “property references”:\n\nElement Deprecated - Set to true\n\nDeprecated Date YM - Specifies the withdrawal date or validity end date of the element in year-month format\n\nDeprecated Date Description - Specifies description of withdrawal period where withdrawal date is not in YYYY-MM\n\n5.2 Country Codes Deprecation\n\nOld country codes are reserved during a transitional period while new code elements that may replace them are taken into use. Such translationally reserved codes will be included in the country taxonomy to facilitate historical reporting.\n\nFor such transitionally reserved country codes:\n\nThe standard label has the withdrawal date in parentheses to indicate the code was valid before the specified date. For example, the standard label for ‘AN’ will be ‘Netherlands Antilles (before 2010-12-15)’.\n\nThe following additional metadata is attached using “property references”:\n\nElement Deprecated - set to true\n\nDeprecated Date – specifies the withdrawal date or validity end date of the element in yyyy-mm-dd format\n\nStatus Remark - textual description of reservation period\n\n6 Versioning\n\nThe currency and country taxonomies are published in two different formats: “dated” and “current”. These two taxonomies have different versioning approaches.\n\nThe currency taxonomy will be versioned based on the ISO issue date of the currency update. For example, the taxonomy reflecting the changes for currency code updated by ISO on '2023-01-01' and will be versioned as '2023-01-01’.\n\nThe ISO currency code is published as two lists: list one and list three. 'List one' has valid currency codes, and 'list three' has historic codes. The two lists are combined into a single list in the currency taxonomy. It is possible that these lists could be independently updated. In this case, the version date of the currency taxonomy will reflect the latest date of update of either list.\n\nThe versioning information will be reflected in the URL of the taxonomy files and taxonomy package metadata. Examples of URLs for the currency taxonomy based on ISO currency update date '2023-01-01' would be:\n\nhttps://www.xbrl.org/taxonomy/int/currency/2023-01-01/currency.xsd\n\nhttps://www.xbrl.org/taxonomy/int/currency/2023-01-01/currency-label-code.xml\n\nThe country taxonomy will be versioned based on the ISO issue date of the country update. For example, the taxonomy reflecting the changes for country code updated by ISO on '2023-04-04' and will be versioned as '2023-04-04’.\n\nThe versioning information is reflected in the URL of the taxonomy files and taxonomy package metadata. Examples of URLs for the country taxonomy based on ISO country update date '2023-04-04' ' would be:\n\nhttps://www.xbrl.org/taxonomy/int/country/2023-04-04/country.xsd\n\nhttps://www.xbrl.org/taxonomy/int/country/2023-04-04/country-label-code.xml\n\n6.1.3 Public consultation release versioning\n\nTaxonomy releases containing structural changes for public review are identified by their status (PWD/CR/PR) and release date. For example, the URL of the country taxonomy file released on 31 March 2023 as a public working draft (PWD) based on the ISO issue date '2022-11-29’ would be:\n\nhttp://www.xbrl.org/taxonomy/int/country/2022-11-29/PWD/2023-03-31/country.xsd\n\n6.2 'Current' version\n\nThe country and currency taxonomy will also be provided with a current /up-to-date version reflecting ISO codes at any point in time. The withdrawn codes are deprecated but never deleted and will always be available for reporting; hence updates to the code list should not invalidate the historical reports. The URLs of the up-to-date taxonomy files would be -\n\nhttps://www.xbrl.org/taxonomy/int/country/current/country-en.xsd\n\nhttps://www.xbrl.org/taxonomy/int/currency/current/currency-en.xsd\n\n7 Taxonomy Components\n\n7.1 Custom Label Roles\n\nCurrency and country taxonomies defines following custom label roles in role-label-code.xsd:\n\nalpha3CodeLabel – Label roles used to specify ‘Alphabetic 3-character code’ for currency/country code.\n\nalpha2CodeLabel – Label roles used to specify ‘Alphabetic 2-character code’ for country code.\n\nnumericCodeLabel – Label roles used to specify ‘Numeric code’ for currency/country code.\n\n7.2 Custom Reference Parts\n\nCurrency and country taxonomies defines following custom reference parts in property-part.xsd:\n\nElementDeprecated – Reference part using Boolean value to indicate whether the code is withdrawn from use. This is available in currency and country taxonomies.\n\nDeprecatedDateYM - Reference part to indicate the withdrawal date or validity end date of the element in year-month format. This is used in currency taxonomy.\n\nDeprecatedDate - Reference part to indicate the withdrawal date or validity end date of the element in yyyy-mm-dd format. This is used in country taxonomy.\n\nDeprecatedDateDescription – Reference part to provide textual description of withdrawal period where withdrawal date is not in YYYY-MM. This is used in currency taxonomy.\n\nStatusRemark – Reference part to provide additional textual information reservation period for codes. This is used in country taxonomy.\n\n7.3 Namespaces\n\nThe currency taxonomy uses following namespaces, where YYYY-MM-DD are the ISO update date on which the taxonomy is based:\n\ncurrency-elts.xsd - https://xbrl.org/taxonomy/int/currency/YYYY-MM-DD/currency-elts\n\ncurrency.xsd - https://xbrl.org/taxonomy/int/currency/YYYY-MM-DD/currency\n\ncurrency-en.xsd - https://xbrl.org/taxonomy/int/currency/YYYY-MM-DD/currency-en\n\nproperty-part.xsd - https://xbrl.org/taxonomy/int/currency/YYYY-MM-DD/property-part\n\nrole-label-code.xsd - https://xbrl.org/taxonomy/int/currency/YYYY-MM-DD/role-label-code\n\nThe country taxonomy uses following namespaces, where YYYY-MM-DD are the ISO update date on which the taxonomy is based:\n\ncountry-elts.xsd - https://xbrl.org/taxonomy/int/country/YYYY-MM-DD/country-elts\n\ncountry.xsd - https://xbrl.org/taxonomy/int/country/YYYY-MM-DD/country\n\ncountry-en.xsd - https://xbrl.org/taxonomy/int/country/YYYY-MM-DD/country-en\n\nproperty-part.xsd - https://xbrl.org/taxonomy/int/country/YYYY-MM-DD/property-part\n\nrole-label-code.xsd - https://xbrl.org/taxonomy/int/country/YYYY-MM-DD/role-label-code\n\n7.4 Taxonomy Entry Point Absolute URLs\n\nThe following table shows the absolute URLs for taxonomy entry points where YYYY-MM-DD is the ISO update date on which the taxonomy is based:\n\nEntry Point Description Absolute URL Currency List with English Labels Currency codes as domain members for use as dimension values or enumeration values, with ISO 4217 code labels and English language labels (as provided by ISO). https://www.xbrl.org/taxonomy/int/currency/YYYY-MM-DD/currency-en.xsd Currency List Currency codes as domain members for use as dimension values or enumeration values. Includes ISO 4217 code labels only. https://www.xbrl.org/taxonomy/int/currency/YYYY-MM-DD/currency.xsd Country List with English Labels Country codes as domain members for use as dimension values or enumeration values, with ISO 3166 code labels, and English language labels (as provided by ISO). https://www.xbrl.org/taxonomy/int/country/YYYY-MM-DD/country-en.xsd Country List Country codes as domain members for use as dimension values or as enumeration values. Includes ISO 3166 code labels only. https://www.xbrl.org/taxonomy/int/country/YYYY-MM-DD/country.xsd\n\n8 Taxonomy Maintenance Plan\n\nXBRL International subscribes to the notifications about updates from the ISO, Maintenance Authority (MA) and has implemented a mechanism to automatically deploy these changes, together with relevant supporting metadata in an XBRL Taxonomy. An example of ISO code update notification can be seen in these links – currency code and country code.\n\nThe ISO currency and country code update notification will initiate the currency or country taxonomies update process. The update to the taxonomies will be carried out by XBRL International staff.\n\nThe initial taxonomy and updates that propose structural change will follow the governance and maturity cycle as applicable for technical specification development, or (later) taxonomy-specific governance as defined by the XBRL Standards Board from time to time. Non-structural update to taxonomy will be reviewed and approved by XBRL Standards Board.\n\nStructural changes include changes to taxonomy logical and physical modelling or technical specification updates. Examples of non-structural changes include code updates as per ISO code changes or label updates.\n\n9 Additional Language Labels\n\nWhile the default currency and country taxonomies include English labels, additional language labels can be contributed by XBRL jurisdictions or regulators. The additional language labels will be made available as a modular taxonomy file and taxonomy package to be referenced in the taxonomy wanting to use them.\n\nThe French label file (country-label-fr.xml) for country taxonomy 2022-11-29 would be available at the official location - http://www.xbrl.org/taxonomy/int/country/2022-11-29/fr/country-label-fr.xml and as a separate taxonomy package.\n\nBy default, two letter language codes will be used to identify additional language label, but adding sub-codes will be considered if requested. The regional codes will be reflected in the taxonomy file URL and the taxonomy file name as seen above exmaple.\n\n10 Mapping codes to taxonomy\n\nISO publishes Currency and Country codes in XML formats, which are used to generate taxonomy. The mapping between the source ISO XML and taxonomy artefacts is provided in the section\n\nThis section describes mapping of ISO Currency and Country code XML to XBRL taxonomy artefacts. The XML element indicates the element in the ISO code XML file.\n\n10.1 Currency Code - Mapping\n\nISO currency code XML can be accessed from the links below:\n\nValid Currency Codes\n\nWithdrawn Currency Codes\n\nFund codes is not included (where <CcyNm IsFund=\"true\"> the code is omitted). Precious metal and other non-currency codes that start with \"ZZ**_\" are also excluded from the currency taxonomy.\n\nList one of the currency codes, includes the following special currency which are excluded from the currency taxonomy.\n\nSDR (Special Drawing Right) - INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND (IMF)\n\nADB Unit of Account - MEMBER COUNTRIES OF THE AFRICAN DEVELOPMENT BANK GROUP\n\nThe mapping for ISO code XML fields to taxonomy artefacts for each currency domain member is as follows:\n\nElement Name - <Ccy>\n\nStandard Label for list one currencies - <CcyNm>\n\nStandard Label for list three currencies - <CcyNm> (before <WthdrwlDt>)\n\nThe before date in the standard label is to distinguish the withdrawal currency. This is useful where historic and valid currencies have the same name. For example, 'MXP' and 'MXN' both have <CcyNm> as 'Mexican Peso'. 'MXP' was withdrawn in 1993; its standard name would be 'Mexican Peso (before 1993-01)'.\n\nDocumentation label - Geographical entity(ies) associated with the currency <Ccy> is/are <CtryNm>(n)\n\nalpha3CodeLabel (custom label role) - <Ccy> (repeating the 3-letter currency as an additional label apart from capturing it in the element name, which may be useful in some cases)\n\nnumericCodeLabel (custom label role) - <CcyNbr> (numeric codes)\n\n10.1.1 Reference Information\n\nFor all codes:\n\nPublisher: International Organization for Standardization\n\nName: ISO\n\nNumber: 4217\n\nParagraph: List\n\nSubparagraph: List one OR List three (Withdrawn codes)\n\nURI: https://www.iso.org/iso-4217-currency-codes.html\n\nWithdrawn codes details in property reference (custom parts):\n\nDeprecated Date: <WthdrwlDt>\n\nElement Deprecated: true\n\nWhen <WthdrwlDt> is not in YYYY-MM format the month is assumed to be December of the end period. For example, ‘ARY’ was withdrawn during the period ‘1989 to 1990’, the Deprecated Date is this case in specified in the taxonomy as 1990-12. For such cases withdrawal period is captured as an additional reference part in ‘Deprecated Date Description’\n\n10.2 Country Code - Mapping\n\nA sample of ISO country code XML can be accessed from this link - Sample Country Code XML. Country taxonomy includes country codes which has <status> = ‘officially-assigned’ or ‘transitionally-reserved’.\n\nThe mapping for ISO code XML fields to taxonomy artefacts for each country domain member is as follows:\n\nElement Name - <alpha-2-code>\n\nStandard Label - <short-name lang3code=\"eng\" xml:lang=\"en\"> or <short-name-upper-case lang3code=\"eng\" xml:lang=\"en\"> when the former is not available . (ISO also provides Country Names in French; the initial plan is to include only English labels in the taxonomy).\n\nStandard Label for transitionally-reserved country codes - <short-name lang3code=\"eng\" xml:lang=\"en\"> (before <validity-end-date>)\n\nThe standard label's before date distinguishes the reserved country code from the current codes.\n\nVerbose Label - <full-name lang3code=\"eng\" xml:lang=\"en\">\n\nalpha2CodeLabel (custom label role) - <alpha-2-code> (repeating the 2-letter country as an additional label apart from capturing it in the element name may be useful in some cases)\n\nalpha2CodeLabel (custom label role) - <alpha-3-code> (alphabetic 3-character (alpha-3) code\n\nnumericCodeLabel (custom label role) - <numeric-code> (numeric code)\n\n10.2.1 Reference Information\n\nFor all codes:\n\nPublisher: International Organization for Standardization\n\nName: ISO\n\nNumber: 3166-1\n\nParagraph: List\n\nURI: https://www.iso.org/obp/ui/#iso:code:3166:GB\n\nWithdrawn code details in property reference (custom parts). This will be only for codes with <status> = 'transitionally-reserved'."
