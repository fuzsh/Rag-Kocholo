        "text": "Currency number formats\n\nAll currency data is expressed as a three-letter code. The first two letters of the code are taken from the two letters of ISO 3166-1 alpha-2 country codes and the third is usually the initial of the currency itself. Codes are represented as capital letters. For example, Australia's currency code is AUD: AU for Australia and D for dollar.\n\nThere are also codes for \"supranational\" currencies, procedural purposes, and several things which are \"similar to\" currencies (the so-called X currencies). Changes in the codes take place as needed to reflect changes to countries and currencies. For example, Gold has the code XAU, Silver has the code XAG and XXX is the code for a transaction involving no currency.\n\nThere is no provision for embedding exchange rates in these codes.\n\nThere is also a three-digit code number assigned to each currency, based on ISO 3166-1 numeric codes, but this is not currently used by Amazon MWS. Minor currency units are also defined in ISO 4217, but they are not currently used by Amazon MWS.\n\nAmazon MWS uses currency codes as values for operation parameters. This means that only the currency code is required. Other parameters are used for amounts."
