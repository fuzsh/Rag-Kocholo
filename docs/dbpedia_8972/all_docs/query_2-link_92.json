        "text": "Our currency list below complies with ISO 4217 with the exception that official ISO currency names are not usually prefixed with country names or adjectives unless the currency name is not unique (e.g. Dollar, Pound, Franc, Dinar, Rupee etc). Therefore, where the currency name is unique, we have added the appropriate country name or adjective in order to clarify the country to which the currency relates.\n\nNotes\n\nIf an ISO currency code begins with X, this indicates that the currency is not specific to one particular country.\n\nBCEAO = Banque Centrale des Etats de l'Afrique de l'Ouest.\n\nBEAC = Banque des Etats de l'Afrique Centrale.\n\nThe decimal places column indicates the number of decimal places used for amounts (not exchange rates). For example, JPY has 0 decimal places, indicating that there are no sub-units. Most currencies have 2 decimal places, indicating that there are 100 sub-units (e.g. cents, pence etc) in a major unit. Some Middle Eastern currencies have 3 decimal places, indicating that there are 1000 sub-units in a major unit.\n\nIn order to ensure that currency tables in databases are correct and current, we recommend to our customers that they subscribe to ISO 4217.\n\nIf the currency table in your database lists incorrect currency names such as \"British Pound\", \"United States Dollar\", \"Maltese Pound\", \"Rouble\", \"Florin\" or \"Kronor\", then there is a good chance that other entries in the table are also wrong. You may download the above correct data in CSV format from here."
