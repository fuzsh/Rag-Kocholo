        "text": "Once a month, an armored car delivers state funds in cash to top government officials -- over a year, more than $50 million. The public has no idea what happens to this money. No legal inquiry can ever reach the truth because the funds are treated as a state secret.\n\nA third world dictatorship? A banana republic? A family-run Persian Gulf country? Guess again.\n\nThis is France's Fifth Republic.\n\nBut France's system of secret funds may not exist for much longer.\n\nRevelations that President Jacques Chirac may have paid for nearly $300,000 worth of airplane tickets with his share of the secret funds has opened a national debate over a system that has been in place for more than 50 years but is increasingly being questioned as an unsavory relic of the past.\n\n''In a totally secret and uncontrolled fashion, some 200 million francs in 500-franc notes are circulating between the prime minister's office, the presidency and the various ministries,'' Thierry Jean-Pierre, a former judge, wrote in the daily Le Monde this week. ''The whole ruling elite is complicit.''\n\nMr. Jean-Pierre, now a member of Parliament, was not the only voice expressing outrage at a fund originally set up to pay for secret security services. With next year's elections approaching and polls showing that the French public has less patience for corruption, officials have spoken out against the system -- even some of those who had admitted benefiting from the handouts.\n\nJean-Louis Debr√©, a senior member of Mr. Chirac's conservative party, Rally for the Republic, demanded an immediate freeze on the secret fund and an accounting of how the money was spent.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
