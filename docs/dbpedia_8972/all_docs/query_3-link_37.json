        "text": "August 2024\n\nIntroduction\n\nThe National Endowment for Democracy (NED)âactsâas the US governmentâs âwhite gloves.ââItâhas long engaged inâsubverting state power in other countries, meddling in other countriesâ internal affairs, inciting division and confrontation, misleadingâpublic opinion, and conducting ideological infiltration, allâunder the pretext of promoting democracy. Its innumerable evilâdeedsâhave caused grave harm andâdrawnâstrong condemnation from the international community.â\n\nIn recent years, NED has kept changing tactics and gone even further in acting against the historical trend of peace, development and win-win cooperation. It has become more notorious for its infiltration, subversion and sabotage attempts against other countries. It is imperative to unmask NED and alert all countries to the need to see through its true colors, guard against and fight back its disruption and sabotage attempts, safeguard their national sovereignty, security and development interests, and uphold world peace and development and international fairness and justice.\n\nâ . NEDâthe US governmentâs âwhite glovesâ\n\nNED claims to be an NGO that provides support for democracy abroad. In fact, it acts as the US governmentâs âwhite glovesâ in carrying out subversion, infiltration and sabotage across the world.\n\n1.âNED is the implementer of CIA covert operations. In the early days of the Cold War, CIA supported opposition activities in socialist countries in Eastern Europe via âprivate voluntary organizationsââto advance âpeaceful evolution.â After such activities were exposed in the mid to late 1960s, the US government began contemplating cooperation with civil society organizationsâto conduct similar activities. Hence the idea of setting up an organization of this kind. As William Blum, an American scholar, wrote, âThe idea was that the NED would do somewhat overtly what the CIA had been doing covertly for decades, and thus, hopefully, eliminate the stigma associated with CIA covert activities.ââ\n\n2.âNED was established under the auspices of the US government. In 1981, after he came into office, President Ronald Reagan intended to promote his âProject Democracyâ abroad, and proposed a government-funded and privately-run foundation to openly support âdemocratic movements abroad.â One of the purposes of NED, created in 1983, is to encourage the establishment and growth of democratic development in a manner consistent both with the broad concerns of US national interests and with the specific requirements of the democratic groups in other countries which are aided by programs funded by NED.\n\n3.âNED is funded by US government. On November 22, 1983, the US Congress passed the NED Actâwhich reiterated the purposes of NED and clarified such issues as congressional appropriations, financial audit by the government, and the requirement to report to the Congress and the President. In 1983, the year when NED was established, the Congress provided US$18 million to NED. Over the past 40-plus years, the volume of congressional appropriations has kept increasing in general. According to data from USAspending.gov, NED received an appropriation of US$315 million in FY2023. As a report of the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace revealed, âAlmost all the NEDâs funds come from the US Congress.âIIââ\n\n4. NED programs are run under the guidance of the US State Department and embassies abroad. As required by the enabling legislation for NED,âNED should consult with the State Department on its program plans to seekâforeign policy guidance. According to a USAID report âDemocracy Promotion Programs Funded by the US Government,â NED consults on an ongoing basis with the State Department, through the Bureau of Democracy, Human Rights and Labor, with USIA and with US embassies abroad on programmatic matters.â\n\n5. NED reports to the US government on its work and accepts audit and oversight by the government. According to the NED Act, NED shall submit to the President an annual report for the preceding fiscal year no later than December 31 of each year. The report should include NEDâs operations, activities and accomplishments. Audit of NED is conducted annually by the US Government General AccountingâOffice. A report of each audit shall be made to the Congress, and a copy of each report shall be furnished to the President.\n\n6. The US government has access to information on all NED-funded programs. According toâthe NED Act, NED or any of its duly authorized representatives shall have access to any books, documents, papers, and records of the recipient pertinent to assistance provided through NED. The US Comptroller General or any of his duly authorized representatives shall also have access thereto.\n\n7. NEDâs mandate is endorsed by the US government. Philip Agee, a former CIA officer, said on a 1995 TV show, âNowadays, instead of having just the CIA going around behind the scenes and trying to manipulate the process secretly by inserting money here and instructions there and so forth, they have now a sidekick, which is this National Endowment for Democracy, NED.â In a report entitledââThe National Endowment for Democracy: A Prudent Investment in the Future,ââKim Holmes, former Assistant Secretary of State, argues that âFunding theâNED is a prudent investment because it is far less expensive to aid friendly democrats than it is to defend against hostile dictatorships.ââ\n\nII. Instigating color revolutions to subvert state powerâin other countries\n\n1.âAttempting to overthrow the Iranian government.âIn September 2022, protestsâagainst hijab rules broke out in Iran. Masih Alinejad, a reporter for the Voice of AmericaâPersian Service, releasedâbatches of unverified information and pictures to incite publicâsentiments. According toâAl Mayadeen, a Lebanese news channel, between 2015 and 2022, Masih Alinejad received US$628,000 in funding from NED and some other Americanâinstitutions. Iran Dailyâcited a document from Iranâs Revolutionary Guards as saying that NED used its ties with Masih Alinejad to interfere in Iranâsâinternal affairs during the hijab protests. In the meantime, NED also supported theâCenter for Human Rights in Iran (CHRI)âand the Human Rights Activists News Agency (HRANA)âin theirâfabrication ofâfake news, and supported dissidents in working with anti-government organizations and media outlets to stage smearâcampaigns. NED regularly published commentaries on its Journal of Democracy to call for aâregime change in Iran through human rights movement. NED isâdubbed by Iranian media as a âNational Enemy for Democracyâ and âthe NED Trojanââdisruptingâorder and incitingâunrest in Iran.\n\n2.âUsing various tactics to infiltrate Arab countries. Since the start of the Arab Spring, NED has made extensiveâuse of social media platforms and funded NGOs for releasingâmultimedia content and providingâonline training, in a bidâto instigateâcolor revolutions. NED has also runâa talent reserve program for democratic transition in the region, funded NGOs to helpââsupportersâof democracy,âââhuman rights activistsâ and âdissidentsâ in exile, encouraged local trade unions to strengthen capacity building, and supported scholars and activists inâplottingââconstitutional reformsâ in various countries.\n\n3.âPlaying a partâin Ukraineâsââcolor revolution.ââDuring the 2004 Orange Revolution, NED provided US$65 million to the Ukrainian opposition. Betweenâ2007 andâ2015, NED allocatedâmore thanâUS$30 million to support Ukrainian NGOs and promote âcivic participation.ââDuring the 2013-2014 Euromaidan, NED financed the Mass Media Institute to spreadâinflammatory information. NEDâalso spentâtens of millions of dollars in the use of such social media platforms as Facebook, Xâ(formerlyâTwitter),âand Instagram to spreadâdisinformation, heightenâethnic tensions in Ukraine, and stir up ethnic antagonism in eastern Ukraine.\n\n4.âAttemptingâto overthrowâthe DPRK government.âIn July 2002,âNEDâPresident Carl Gershman told the media that NEDâwas workingâwith theâCongressâtoâcarry out activities through a number of NGOs and swayâpublic opinion regardingâthe DPRK, with a view toâunderminingâthe DPRK system.âIn July 2021, Gershman told the media that thanks to NED-fundedâhuman rights programs, âThe totalitarian systemâ[in the DPRK]âis beginning to erode, and eventually this will bring about the systemâs unraveling.â\n\nâ ¢. Colludingâwith all sorts of elementsâto meddleâin other countriesââinternal affairs\n\n1. Cultivating pro-US forces in target countries\n\nâAccording to itsâ2021 Annual Report, NEDâsupported pro-US mediaâoutlets, cultivated âdemocracy activists,ââand financed groups forââdemocracy and freedomââin Arab countries.\n\nâIn May 2021, NEDâPresident Carl Gershman said that despite being prohibitedâfrom Russia, NED funded the operation of a large number of organizations in Russia and supportedâRussian opposition figures in exile inâtheir struggle againstâthe Russian government atâimportantâpolitical junctures, such as the State Duma, presidential and localâelections.â ¢\n\nâNED has long been infiltrating Europe and co-opting EU officials. It has been encouragingâvoice forâtransatlanticism within EU institutionsâwhileâsuppressing voiceâfor strategic autonomy, andâfinancingââindependent mediaââin Europeâto tilt public opinion in favor of the US.\n\nââTakingâMexicoâasâa major target country for infiltration, NED hasâsupportedâorganizations likeâthe MexicansâAgainst Corruption and Impunity (MCCI) and the Mexican Institute forâCompetitiveness (IMCO), and obstructed theâelectricity reformâin Mexico. In 2021, the Mexican government sent a note to the US government condemning NEDâs funding of anti-government organizations in Mexico as âan act of interventionismâ âpromoting a coup.â\n\nââSinceâ2017, NED has funded 54 anti-Cuba organizations.âIn 2018, the Cuban Democratic Directorate, an anti-government organization, saidâthat it had received âdemocracy fundsââfrom the US and paid US$48,000 to its employees, agents and contractors in Cuba.\n\nâOver theâyears, NED has been funding scholars and journalists to promote âdemocratization reformsââin Iranâandâcarry out cultural infiltration against Iran.\n\n2. Misrepresenting the human rights situation inâother countries\n\nâThe NED-sponsored Journal of Democracyâhabituallyâholdsâdeveloping countriesâto theâstandard of American-style democracyâand criticizes their presidential elections, economic policies, human rights situations, and democratic transitions.\n\nâIn July 2023, the Journal of Democracyâpublished five articlesâon Indian democracy under the themeâofââIs India Still a Democracy,â claiming thatâsince Prime Minister Narendra Modi rose to power, his government has engaged in what is, by some accounts, a wholesaleâdismantling of democratic institutions, norms, and practices.âIn April 2024, the Journal of Democracyâpublished anâarticle âWhy This Election Is Indiaâs Most Important,ââclaiming that democratic governance in India has been steadily erodingâsince Modiâs second termâbegan and that theâfutureâof India as a plural,âsecular democracyâcould be on the line if Prime Minister Modi and his Bharatiya Janata Partyâwin a third consecutive term.\n\nâHaving classified members of the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) as âdictatorships,ââNEDâhas continuedâto export its values to thoseâcountries through academic, cultural and media activities. According to the NED websiteâand other sources,âNED launched 11 programsâin the GCC countriesâin 2021 with an investment ofâUS$1.8 million,âtoâsupport âdemocracy activists,ââslamâthe human rights recordâof those countries, and stokeâsocial tensionsâin the nameâof promoting freedom of the press.\n\n3. Manipulatingâand interfering in other countriesâ elections\n\nââIn April 2022 and December 2023, Serbia held its presidential, National Assembly and local elections. NEDâinterfered in the entire election process, and went all out to root for pro-US opposition candidates in the run-up to the elections. In May 2023, after two consecutive shooting incidents in Serbia, NED-sponsored human rights groups and pro-US opposition organizations staged mass demonstrations to demand the resignation of the Serbian govâernment.\n\nâNEDâhas long been financing the Philippinesâ Rappler news website. According to a report on the NEDâwebsite, between 2017 and 2021, Rappler received a total of US$786,000 in funding from NED. During the 2022 general election, Rappler lobbied the Philippinesâ Commission on Elections for access to internal information including election trends and campaign spending of candidates, which raised questions from various quarters about the fairness and independence of the election. The authorized access was eventually revoked under intense public pressure.\n\nâNED has long funded anti-Iran organizations such as the Foundation for Democracy in Iran (FDI)âto sabotage elections. This has been admitted in anâarticleâby American social activist Kenneth R. Timmerman, the executive director of FDI.\n\nâIn January 2023, Damon Wilson, Presidentâof NED, publicly expressed concerns about democracy and fairnessâof the Nigerian general electionâduring his interview withâa Nigerian TV program.\n\nâ £. Inciting division and confrontation to undermine the stability of other countries\n\nKennethâWollak,âchairman of the NED board of directors, once told the US Congress NEDâs long-term efforts to empowerâthe opponents of USâenemies and their abilitiesâto change foreign governments.â £\n\n1. Supporting âTaiwan independenceââseparatist forces. In 2022, NED and the Taiwan Democratic Progressive Party authorities co-hosted aâGlobal Assembly of the World Movement for Democracyâand invited European parliamentarians and think tank representatives. They tried to mobilize âdemocratic forcesââto open up the âfrontline of democratic struggleâin the Eastââand hype up the false narrative of âUkraine today, Taiwan tomorrow.â In July 2023, NEDâPresident Damon Wilson went to Taiwan for the 20th anniversary celebration of the Taiwan Foundation for Democracy, and presented a âDemocracy Service Medalââto Tsai Ing-wen.\n\n2. Colluding with anti-China destabilizing forces in Hong Kong. NED has long been colluding with those who attempt to destabilize Hong Kong byâproviding funds and public support. In 2020, NED set upâseveral projects under its Hong Kong-related program with a total amount of over US$310,000âto fundâthose attempting to destabilize Hong Kong. In 2023, NED colluded with organizations such as the Hong Kong Watchâand Amnesty International, as well as anti-China lawmakers from the US, UK and Germany,âandânominatedâJimmy Lai Chee-ying, one of the elements bent on destabilizingâHong Kong, for the 2023 Nobel Peace Prize.\n\n3. NED has long supported the anti-China organization âWorld Uyghur Congressâ(WUC),â with average annual funding ranging from US$5 million to US$6 million. In March 2024, NED invited a âWUCâ leader toâspeak at itsâevent,âsmearingâChinaâs ethnic policies and the development of regions with large ethnic minority populations.\n\nNED provided financial support to Hidayet Oguzhan, leader of theââEast Turkistan Education and Solidarity Association,ââandâinstructed Hidayet Oguzhan to ramp up anti-China rallies and sow discord between China andâTÃ¼rkiye. NED also funded Rushan Abbas, the headâof anââEast Turkistanââorganization, so that she could frequently visit TÃ¼rkiye and work with âEast Turkistanâ forcesâto stir up trouble.\n\n4.âIn March 2023, NEDâPresident Damon Wilsonâled a NED delegation to Dharamsala, India, to meet with âTibet independenceâ leaders and show support for âTibet independenceâ activities. In November 2023, NED gaveâthe Democracy Award for Individual Courageâto Jigme Gyatso, a âTibet independenceââactivist. In April 2024, NED invited the âKalon Tripaâ of the âTibetan government-in-exileâ Penpa Tsering to itsâheadquarters.\n\n5. NED funded the establishment of three localâNGO groupings in Georgiaâat the beginning of the 21st century to organize demonstrations in capital Tbilisi. In May 2024, NED rallied support for and instigated protests in Georgia against the foreignâagentsâbill.\n\nâ ¤. Fabricating false information to mislead public opinion\n\n1.âNEDâPresident Damon Wilson, in an interview with Asahi Shimbun,âfalsely alleged that China used technical means and AI to surveilâcitizens. On November 30, 2023, NED Vice President Christopher Walker made up lies about CPCâmonopolizing ideasâwhen testifying before the US House Select Committee on the Strategic Competition Between the United States and the Chinese Communist Party.ââ ¤\n\n2.âNED-backed Serbian NGOsâcoordinated with CNNâs Serbiaâbranch to fabricate China-related fake news, slandering projects undertaken by the Chinese sideâand hyping up so-called environmental protection, labor and corruption issues.\n\n3.âNED funded theâInternational Republican Institute (IRI) to launch the second phase of the Bolstering Europe Against the Subversive Tactics of the CPC project, which fabricates and disseminates the so-called threat of CPC to democratic values and transatlantic solidarity.\n\n4.âNED invested US$17.41 million to carry out 92 projects on âDPRK defectors.â It funded ROKâNGOsâto runâDPRK-themed radios, producing and broadcasting on a weekly basis stories about âDPRK defectorsâ from the perspective of âdemocracy and human rights.â It created DPRK-themed online publications to spread negative news about the DPRK, trainedââdefectorsâ to becomeâreporters, and encouraged themâto defame the DPRK byâwriting onlineâposts and attending video interviews.\n\n5.âNED formed an information matrix against Iran together with Iran International, the Persian serviceâof VOAâand BBC, and other anti-Iran media. Negative informationâisâprovided to anti-Iran media by NED and its affiliated agenciesâto instigate intensive news coverage against Iran.\n\nâ ¥. Using âacademic activitiesâ as a cloak for interference and infiltration\n\n1.âNED funded the Governance Center for Public Policies (GCPP) in Iraq, whichâreleasedâtheâNational Index for Democratic Transformation in Iraq reportâforâsix consecutive years, giving low scoresâevery time to Iraqâs democracy,âand categorizing Iraq as a âpartial authoritarian transitionalâ country. People from across the society in Iraq disapprove the report as it did not truthfully reflect Iraqâs progress in government administration, social governance, democracy and legal system. They believe the purpose of keeping the scores low is toâprovide excuses for continued US interference in Iraqâs internal affairs and postponement of its military withdrawal.\n\n2.âIn March 2024, NEDâs core grantee institution Center for International Private Enterprise (CIPE), together with the Philippines Makati Business Clubâand other associations,âjointly published the first State of Sustainability Reporting in theâPhilippines, unfairly imposing upon the Philippinesâcarbon emission standards and obligations of the US and other industrialized countries in the West toâpressure the government of the Philippines to changeâthe countryâs economic structure.\n\n3.âNED provided hundreds of thousands of dollars in funding to the European Values Center for Security Policy (EVC), Global Security Center (GSC)âand other think tanks to organize various seminars and activities that incite the EUâto follow suit with the USââsmall yard, high fenceâ policy.\n\n4. Since the beginning of the Ukraine crisis, the NED-funded Belgrade Center for Security Policy has supported protests by pro-Western demonstrationsâand criticized Serbiaâs foreign policy.\n\n5. From January 2022 to January 2023, NED funded,âthroughâAtlas Network, the Turkish digital media platform daktilo1984.com, and supportedâactivities on this platform thatâspread discontent and inciteâethnic tension, social conflict and political differences.\n\n6.âNED has long funded NGOs in âKosovoâ to instigate tension between the Serbian government and the Pristina provisional self-governance institution. In December 2023, the NED-funded think tank Sbunkerâreleased a report saying that âKosovoâ is a relatively successful case of American support for nation building and promotion of democracy, an attempt to whitewash USâ true intention to invade and split other countries.\n\n7.âNED used social media to wage information warfare against Iran. During the protests against hijab rules, a large number of social media bots with a big followingâemerged, disguisingâas personal accounts or independent media to spread anti-Iran information and mislead the public.\n\n8. NED and USAID funded multiple Ukrainian organizations to serve as âfact-checkersââof Ukraineâsâsocial media. But suchââfact-checkingâ is in fact an information filter created by the USâon the Ukrainian Internet to deceive the Ukrainian people.\n\nâ ¦. NEDâexposed and criticized by the USâand the international community\n\n1. NEDâs true nature exposed by Americans\n\nâFormer federal congressmanâRon Paulâonceâpostedâthat NED wasted a lot of American taxpayersâ money to support foreign politicians and parties favored by the US, and such actions clearly violate the domestic lawâof the United States. NED provided âsoft moneyâ to fund foreignâelections butâportrayed such manipulation ofâelection as âpromoting democracy.ââ\n\nâFormer federal congressmanâBarneyâFrank called forâcutting the funding for NED in the 1980s. He arguedâthat giving money to a French union for political purposes, rather than funding public transportation or research on cancer, is not reasonable.\n\nâThe New York Timesâpublished âMixed US Signals Helped Tilt Haiti Toward Chaosââin January 29, 2006, which revealsâhow theâUS governmentâsubverted,âthrough NED, Haitiâs democratically elected government.\n\nâIn September 2021, Stephen Kinzer, a former reporter of The New York Times, publishedâarticlesâin the New York Review of BooksâwebsiteâunveilingâthatâNED collaborates with CIA and USAIDâto support insurgentâforcesâin other countriesâin a bid toâoverthrow regimes that the US dislikes. According to the articles, early members of the NED board of directors were mostly warmongers, and among the current board members areâformer federal senators enthusiastic about regime change inâCuba and Nicaragua. The mission of NED is to overthrowâunfriendlyâforeign governments and installâregimes more in line with American interests.\n\n2.âNEDâs misdeedsâexposed and criticized by the international community â\n\nâOn July 29, 2015, the Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs issued a statement officially listing NED as an âundesirable organizationâ and banned its activities within Russian territory. The statement said the US Department of State had made a clearly hypocritical statement about being âdeeply troubledâ over the fate of Russian civic society. Most of NEDâs projects aimed to destabilize the domestic situation in countries trying to pursue an independent policy in line with its own national interests rather than following Washingtonâs lead.\n\nâIn May 2022, the Russian news agency TASS reported that when interviewed by the magazine National Defense,âRussiaâs Assistant Secretary of the Security Council Nail Mukhitov commented that NED mainly affects young people, attempting to erode their patriotism and downplay the role of Russia in the modern world order. Using âliberating the peopleâ as an excuse, the West attempts toâinstall negative views about Russia in its citizens.\n\nâFrench journalist FrÃ©dÃ©ric Charpierâpublished the book CIA in France: 60 Years of Interferenceâin French Affairsâin 2008, revealing NEDâactivities in France, and stated that NED relies on disbursement from three agenciesâUS State Department, USIA, and USAID, and serves theâUS diplomatic and military policies.\n\nâIn 2010, the French website Voltaire Network published an article by its founder, Thierry Meyssan, titled âNED, the Legal Window of the CIA,ââexposingâNEDâs direct involvement in French NGOs, its interference in French elections,âamong other misdeeds.\n\nâIn 2018, the Hungarian media Figyeloâblacklisted the HungarianâHelsinki Committee, a civil human rights organization fundedâby NED, asââSoros mercenaries,ââaccusing it of colluding with foreign forces and undermining the stability of Hungary.\n\nâIn April 2023, NED openedâfunding applications to recruit non-partisan, independent media seekingâto defend human rights and the rule of law, and support freedom of speech. Stephen Kinzer, former reporter of The New York Times, cautionedâworldâgovernments that NEDâs sole purpose is training people to destabilizeâgovernments that Washington disapproves.\n\nâThe Institute of World Economy and International Relationsâ(IMEMO)âof Russia pointed out in its article âthe National Endowment for Democracy at 40:âBack to Basics?â that NED allows the US governmentâto pursue a simultaneous two-level foreign policyâwith current dictatorial governments,âin which the US government maintains relations,âwhile NED works at the sub-state level over the long termâto cultivate required political forces capable of replacing these governments in the future. NED can play a role in sensitive areas where government programs are inconvenient.\n\nâIn June 2023, Agencia BrasilâquotedâCamila Feix Vidal,âprofessor at the FederalâUniversity of SantaâCatarina, as saying that NED is strong evidence of democracyâbeing used as a pretext for seeking gains and a moral excuse for meddling in other countries.\n\nâIn 2016, the Indian government putâNED under watch list due to its donation to NGOs in contravention of the provisions of the Foreign ContributionâRegulationâAct.\n\nConclusion\n\nUnder the guise of democracy, freedom, and human rights, the United States has used NED forâinfiltration, interference and subversion against other countries. This hasâgrosslyâviolatedâother countriesâ sovereignty, security and development interests, blatantlyâbreached international law and basic norms of international relations, and severely jeopardized world peace and stability. Such unpopularâand despicableâactsâare firmlyâopposed by the international community.\n\nThe world is moving toward multipolarity, and there need to be greater democracy in international relations. Every country has the right to pursueâa development path suitedâtoâitsânational realities and the needs of itsâpeople. No country is in a position to lecture others on democracy and human rights, still lessâusingâdemocracy and human rights as excusesâto infringe uponâthe sovereignty of other countries, interfere in their internal affairs and inciteâideological confrontation.âFollowing humanityâs common values ofâpeace, development, fairness, justice, democracy and freedom,âmembers of the international community should engage in exchanges and dialogue on the basis of mutual respect and equality, and work together to contribute to the progress of humanity.\n\nNote\n\nâ .William Henry Blum, Rogue State: A Guide to the Worldâs Only Superpower, Zed book, 2006\n\nII.Thomas Carothers, Benjamin Feldman, Examining U.S. Relations with Authoritarian Countries, Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, Dec.2023\n\nâ ¢.RT, American âRegime changeâ specialists NED claim credit for Belarus protests & boast of funding Russian opposition during prank call, 17th May, 2021\n\nâ £.Edward Hunt, NED Pursues Regime Change by Playing the Long Game, Counterpunch, 6th July, 2018\n\nâ ¤.U.S. House of Representatives Document Repository: docs.house.gov"
