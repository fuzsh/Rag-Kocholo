It shall always be universal, equal and secret.\n\nAll French citizens of either sex who have reached their majority and are in possession of their civil and political rights may vote as provided by statute.\n\nStatutes shall promote equal access by women and men to elective offices and positions.\n\nArticle 4\n\nPolitical parties and groups shall contribute to the exercise of suffrage.

If such a majority is not obtained on the first ballot, a second ballot shall take place on the second following Sunday. Only the two candidates who received the greatest number of votes in the first ballot, account being taken of any withdrawal of candidates with more votes, may stand in the second ballot.\n\nBalloting shall be begun by a writ of election issued by the Government.\n\nThe election of the new President shall be held not less than twenty days and not more than thirty-five days before the expiry of the term of the President in office.\n\nShould the Presidency of the Republic fall vacant for any reason whatsoever, or should the Constitutional Council on a reference from the Government rule by an absolute majority of its members that the President of the Republic is incapacitated, the duties of the President of the Republic, with the exception of those specified in articles 11 and 12, shall be temporarily exercised by the President of the Senate or, if the latter is in turn incapacitated, by the Government.\n\nIn the case of a vacancy, or where the incapacity of the President is declared permanent by the Constitutional Council, the ballot for the election of the new President shall, except in the event of a finding by the Constitutional Council of force majeure, be held not less than twenty days and not more than thirty-five days after the beginning of the vacancy or the declaration that the incapacity is permanent. If, in the seven days preceding the last day for lodging presentations of candidature, any of the persons who, less than thirty days prior to that day, have publicly announced their decision to be a candidate dies or becomes incapacitated, the Constitutional Council may decide to postpone the election.\n\nIf, before the first ballot, any of the candidates dies or becomes incapacitated, the Constitutional Council shall declare the election postponed.\n\nIn the event of the death or incapacitation of either of the two candidates in the lead in the first ballot before any withdrawals, the Constitutional Council shall declare that the electoral procedure must be repeated in full; the same shall apply in the event of the death or incapacitation of either of the two candidates remaining standing for the second ballot.\n\nAll cases shall be referred to the Constitutional Council in the manner laid down in the second paragraph of article 61 or in that laid down for the presentation of candidates in the institutional Act provided for in article 6.\n\nThe Constitutional Council may extend the time limits set in the third and fifth paragraphs, provided that polling takes place not later than thirty-five days after the decision of the Constitutional Council. If the implementation of the provisions of this paragraph results in the postponement of the election beyond the expiry of the term of the President in office, the latter shall remain in office until his successor is proclaimed.\n\nNeither articles 49 and 50 nor article 89 of the Constitution shall be implemented during the vacancy of the Presidency of the Republic or during the period between the declaration that the incapacity of the President of the Republic is permanent and the election of his successor.\n\nArticle 8\n\nThe President of the Republic shall appoint the Prime Minister.

No amendment shall be admissible without the consent of the Government.\n\nIf the joint committee does not succeed in adopting a common text, or if the text is not adopted as provided in the preceding paragraph, the Government may, after a further reading by the National Assembly and by the Senate, ask the National Assembly to make a final decision. In that event, the National Assembly may reconsider either the text drafted by the joint committee, or the last text passed by itself, as modified, if such is the case, by any amendment or amendments adopted by the Senate.\n\nArticle 46\n\nActs of Parliament that the Constitution characterizes as institutional shall be passed and amended as provided in this article.\n\nA government or Member's bill shall not be debated and put to the vote in the assembly in which it was first introduced until fifteen days have elapsed since its introduction.\n\nThe procedure set out in article 45 shall apply. Nevertheless, in the absence of agreement between the two assemblies, the text may be adopted by the National Assembly on final reading only by an absolute majority of its members.\n\nInstitutional Acts relating to the Senate must be passed in identical terms by the two assemblies.\n\nInstitutional Acts shall not be promulgated until the Constitutional Council has declared their conformity with the Constitution.\n\nArticle 47\n\nParliament shall pass finance bills in the manner provided by an institutional Act.\n\nShould the National Assembly fail to reach a decision on first reading within forty days following the introduction of a bill, the Government shall refer the bill to the Senate, which must rule within fifteen days. The procedure set out in article 45 shall then apply.\n\nShould Parliament fail to reach a decision within seventy days, the provisions of the bill may be brought into force by ordinance.\n\nShould the finance bill establishing the resources and expenditures for a financial year not be introduced in time for promulgation before the beginning of that year, the Government shall as a matter of urgency ask Parliament for authorization to collect taxes and shall make available by decree the funds needed to meet the commitments already voted for.\n\nThe time limits set by this article shall be suspended when Parliament is not in session.\n\nThe Audit Court shall assist Parliament and the Government in monitoring the implementation of finance Acts.\n\nArticle 47-1\n\nParliament shall pass social security finance bills in the manner provided by an institutional Act.\n\nShould the National Assembly fail to reach a decision on first reading within twenty days following the introduction of a bill, the Government shall refer the bill to the Senate, which must rule within fifteen days. The procedure set out in article 45 shall then apply.\n\nShould Parliament fail to reach a decision within fifty days, the provisions of the bill may be implemented by ordinance.\n\nThe time limits set by this article shall be suspended when Parliament is not in session and, as regards each assembly, during the weeks when it has decided not to sit in accordance with the second paragraph of article 28.\n\nThe Audit Court shall assist Parliament and the Government in monitoring the implementation of social security finance Acts.\n\nArticle 48\n\nWithout prejudice to the application of the last three paragraphs of article 28, precedence shall be given on the agendas of the assemblies, and in the order determined by the Government, to the discussion of government bills and of Members' bills accepted by the Government. At one sitting a week at least precedence shall be given to questions from Members of Parliament and to answers by the Government. At one sitting a month precedence shall be given to the agenda determined by each assembly.\n\nArticle 49\n\nThe Prime Minister, after deliberation by the Council of Ministers, may make the Government's programme or possibly a statement of its general policy an issue of its responsibility before the National Assembly.\n\nThe National Assembly may raise an issue of the Government's responsibility by passing a motion of censure. Such a motion shall not be admissible unless it is signed by at least one tenth of the members of the National Assembly. Voting may not take place within forty-eight hours after the motion has been introduced. Only the votes in favour of the motion of censure shall be counted; the motion of censure shall not be adopted unless it is voted for by the majority of the members of the Assembly. Except as provided in the following paragraph, a deputy shall not sign more than three motions of censure during a single ordinary session and more than one during a single extraordinary session.\n\nThe Prime Minister may, after deliberation by the Council of Ministers, make the passing of a bill an issue of the Government's responsibility before the National Assembly. In that event, the bill shall be considered adopted unless a motion of censure, introduced within the subsequent twenty-four hours, is carried as provided in the preceding paragraph.\n\nThe Prime Minister may ask the Senate to approve a statement of general policy.\n\nArticle 50\n\nWhere the National Assembly carries a motion of censure, or where it fails to endorse the programme or a statement of general policy of the Government, the Prime Minister must tender the resignation of the Government to the President of the Republic.\n\nArticle 51\n\nThe closing of ordinary or extraordinary sessions shall be postponed by right in order to permit the application of article 49, if the case arises. Additional sittings shall be held by right for the same purpose.\n\nTITLE VI ON TREATIES AND INTERNATIONAL AGREEMENTS\n\nArticle 52\n\nThe President of the Republic shall negotiate and ratify treaties.\n\nHe shall be informed of any negotiations for the conclusion of an international agreement not subject to ratification.\n\nArticle 53\n\nPeace treaties, commercial treaties, treaties or agreements relating to international organization, those that commit the finances of the State, those that modify provisions which are matters for statute, those relating to the status of persons, and those that involve the cession, exchange or addition of territory, may be ratified or approved only by virtue of an Act of Parliament.\n\nThey shall not take effect until they have been ratified or approved.\n\nNo cession, exchange or addition of territory shall be valid without the consent of the population concerned.\n\nArticle 53-1\n\nThe Republic may conclude, with European States that are bound by commitments identical with its own in the matter of asylum and the protection of human rights and fundamental freedoms, agreements determining their respective jurisdiction in regard to the consideration of requests for asylum submitted to them.\n\nHowever, even if the request does not fall within their jurisdiction under the terms of these agreements, the authorities of the Republic shall remain empowered to grant asylum to any foreigner who is persecuted for his action in pursuit of freedom or who seeks the protection of France for some other reason.\n\nArticle 53-2\n\nThe Republic may recognize the jurisdiction of the International Criminal Court as provided by the treaty signed on 18 July 1998.\n\nArticle 54\n\nIf the Constitutional Council, on a reference from the President of the Republic, from the Prime Minister, from the President of one or the other assembly, or from sixty deputies or sixty senators, has declared that an international commitment contains a clause contrary to the Constitution, authorization to ratify or approve the international commitment in question may be given only after amendment of the Constitution.\n\nArticle 55\n\nTreaties or agreements duly ratified or approved shall, upon publication, prevail over Acts of Parliament, subject, in regard to each agreement or treaty, to its application by the other party.\n\nTITLE VII THE CONSTITUTIONAL COUNCIL\n\nArticle 56\n\nThe Constitutional Council shall consist of nine members, whose term of office shall be nine years and shall not be renewable.
