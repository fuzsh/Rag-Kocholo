        "text": "ISO is the International Organisation for Standardisation. ISO currency codes are the agreed alphabetic and numeric codes for the representation of currencies. You’ll spot currency codes when you look for exchange rates online, when you read news about currency values, or when you send international payments.\n\nThis guide covers how standard ISO currency codes work, and provides a list of currency codes for major currencies. We’ll also look at how you can save money on international currency exchange with Wise.\n\nGet a free Wise account\n\nHow do ISO currency codes work?\n\nISO currency codes are used to avoid confusion and simplify trading, sending and receiving foreign currencies.\n\nThe ISO currency code list is overseen by a dedicated maintenance agency, and governed by an official document known as ISO 4217. This system makes sure that each currency has a unique and agreed 3 letter currency symbol, which is mirrored by a 3 digit numeric code. There’s also ISO 3166 which governs country codes and issues agreed alphanumeric codes for each country on earth.\n\nYou’ll usually come across the currency code alphabetic symbols when you’re buying, selling or sending foreign currencies. For example, the code for US dollars is USD - while the euro currency code is EUR. If you see USD/EUR, for example, you’ll know you’re looking at the exchange rate for USD to EUR.\n\nA list of major ISO currency codes\n\nYou can get a full list of ISO currency codes from ISO’s website - or check out this list of major ISO currency codes for reference.\n\nCurrency nameCode Australian dollarsAUD Belize dollarsBZR Canadian dollarsCAD Swiss francsCHF Chinese yuanCNY EuroEUR Hong Kong dollarsHKD Indian rupeeINR Japanese yenJPY Mexican pesoMXN New Zealand dollarsNZD US dollarsUSD South African randZAR\n\nExchange more than 60 currencies with Wise - And save up to 6x\n\nISO currency codes are often used when converting currencies - but it’s good to know that switching your funds with a regular bank can be a costly hassle. You could save up to 6x compared with using your regular bank if you choose a specialist service like Wise.\n\nOpen a Wise account online or in the Wise app in just a few minutes to hold and convert 50+ currencies, and get bank details to receive money from 30 countries for free. You could get paid in a range of global currencies including USD, GBP, AUD, NZD, EUR and SGD just like a local, wherever in the world you might be.\n\nReceive payments to your Wise account, convert to the currencies you need, and send money to 80+ countries around the world, right from your computer or mobile device.\n\nIt’s cheap, easy and instant to convert currencies with Wise. In fact, you can get the currencies you need in seconds, with the mid-market rate and low, transparent fees. See how much you can save with Wise today.\n\nJoin Wise today\n\nISO Currency codes: Good to know\n\nThe ISO currency codes are based on ISO country codes, with the first 2 letters being taken from the agreed ISO country code, and the third - as far as possible - representing the first letter of the currency. So British pounds are described using the country code GB for Great Britain, plus the letter P for pounds - GBP. This isn’t always possible - MXN for example is the currency code for Mexican pesos, although MXP was used up into the early 90s when the peso was revalued.\n\nThe ISO has also agreed and issued equivalent numeric currency codes - these are 3-digit codes which correspond to the more common alphabetic codes. USD for example has the equivalent numeric code of 840. These codes are not intended for general use, so you’re unlikely to come across them in day-to-day life. Instead, the numeric codes are used for trading and order processing algorithms, where a numeric code is more easily recognized by automated systems compared to an alphabetic code.\n\nFrequently asked questions\n\nStill got questions? Here are a couple of popular questions and answers about ISO standard currency codes.\n\nAre all currency codes 3 letters?\n\nCurrency codes are unique codes which are a standard length of 3 letters long.\n\nWhat is the ISO code of Indian rupee?\n\nThe standard ISO currency code for the Indian rupee is IND."
