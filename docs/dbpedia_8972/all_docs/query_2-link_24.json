        "text": "What are ISO Currency Codes?\n\nISO currency codes, commonly used synonymously as country codes, are unique alphanumeric codes assigned to each currency used in international transactions. These codes were established by the International Organisation for Standardisation (ISO) to improve the accuracy and efficiency of global payments.\n\nIt looks a little like this: USD, GBP, EUR\n\nEach country code is made up of three letters — the first two letters represent the country and the third represents the currency. Taking USD for instance, the initial letters “US” constitutes the country, while the “D” indicates its local currency, the dollar.\n\nThis structure helps banks and financial institutions from different countries standardise their messaging and avoid confusion or errors. It’s also especially important in the global economy today where trillions of dollars are transacted globally on a daily basis.\n\nWhat is the ISO 4217 standard?\n\nISO 4217 is an official document that contains all the ISO currency codes. Like a single source of truth for ISO codes. This standard, which was first established in 1978, ensures that each currency has a unique three-letter currency symbol, accompanied by a three-digit numeric code.\n\nTo illustrate, USD has an equivalent numeric code of 840. This numeric code is not intended for general use, so it’s unlikely to come across in a day-to-day transaction. Instead, according to ISO 4217:2015, it is used in applications of trade, commerce, and banking, where the funds are required to be described.\n\nOn top of these, there is also ISO 3166, which governs the country codes and agreed alphanumeric codes for each currency used in international trading.\n\nHow to get the best FX rates on the Malaysian Ringgit?\n\nThanks to technological developments, businesses today have more alternatives than ever that can support global payments. These are traditional banks, foreign exchange platforms, or FinTech providers, which also come with advanced custom solutions.\n\nHowever, exotic currencies such as the Malaysian Ringgit may not be available on certain platforms, which makes it challenging to compare options, let alone find an efficient and cost-effective one.\n\nAt Wallex, we pride ourselves on providing a specialist service designed to get your money where it needs to be.
