ISO 4217 is the International Standard for currency codes. The purpose of ISO 4217 is to define internationally recognised codes of letters and/or numbers that can be used to identify currencies, e.g. for international money transfers or exchange of currencies. This standard was first published in 1978, but many currency codes have been in use before that.

The first two letters of a currency code are consistent with country codes that comply with the ISO 3166 standard. The third letter corresponds, where possible, to the initial letter of a country or territory's currency. For example, the currency code for official currency in Denmark is indicated with "DKK", where "DK" is Denmark's country code in ISO 3166 and "K" is the first letter in "Kroner".
