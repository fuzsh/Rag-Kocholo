The International Organization for Standards (ISO) has a ISO 4217, which delineates currency codes, country codes, etc. for, well, international currency.

Alongside this, each country is given a three-digit numerical code number. I've been trying to figure out what kind of designation process this has, but it appears to be random. Why is it oddly (mostly) random?
