        "text": "My earliest reading memory\n\nWhen I was in junior school I used to read every night in bed before going to sleep. I had a little bookcase in my bedroom that I filled with the Biggles adventures by WE Johns and Agatha Christie novels. My mum was happy to buy me books. She always said that a house without books is a house without a soul. The initial appeal of these books was that they were short, but they took me to some wonderful places and added a splash of excitement to my life.\n\nMy favourite book growing up\n\nI was around 10 years old when one day my teacher was ill and a very old man with a walking stick and a huge military moustache took the class. He read to us the Rudyard Kipling story Rikki-Tikki-Tavi about a mongoose that saves a family from snake attacks. I was transfixed. I had never had a book read to me by a proper storyteller. I can still remember the atmosphere he created to this day. I found the story to read for myself in The Jungle Book – I still have my copy somewhere in the attic. I remember it had beautiful colour illustrations that I ruined by drawing Hitler hairstyles on all the animals and characters.\n\nThe book that changed me as a teenager\n\nThe Catcher in the Rye by JD Salinger. It was the first book I had read that had a voice I could identify as having similar thoughts to myself. I reread it a couple of years ago and it didn’t resonate so much at all. It was me that had changed, not the book.\n\nThe writer who changed my mind\n\nProbably Spike Milligan. As a teenager his books made me laugh like a drain and revealed to me for the first time that books could actually be funny. I hadn’t considered that to be part of the book-reading deal until then. I feel the same about Monty Python’s Big Red Book and Jerome K Jerome’s Three Men in a Boat.\n\nThe book that made me want to become a writer\n\nI suppose it was writing my autobiography And Away … in 2020 that made me want to have a stab at fiction because I enjoyed the process so much. I wanted to write a Murakami-style book but soon realised I didn’t have the skills, imagination or talent required. In my novel The Satsuma Complex I feature an extract from a fictional novel of the same name. This extract is actually from my first attempt to write a Murakami rip off. It is undoubtedly the worst bit of the book.\n\nThe book I reread\n\nI have reread Three Men in a Boat on numerous occasions, mainly just to share some hours with a precious old friend. When I first read it I found Jerome’s hypochondria hilarious, I now find it perfectly reasonable and empathise thoroughly with his upset.\n\nThe book I could never read again\n\nJRR Tolkien’s The Lord of the Rings. I just wouldn’t be as in awe of its bulk or so taken in by the magic and the fantasy. Shame really. I enjoy the films because I remain in awe of their length and confidence.\n\nThe book I discovered later in life\n\nIt’s 30-odd years since publication, but I only discovered The Wind-Up Bird Chronicle by Murakami quite recently. It’s my favourite ever book and I doubt it will ever be defeated as far as my readings go. It’s all nonsense of course but I believe every single word that is written.\n\nThe book I am currently reading\n\nThe Bee Sting by Paul Murray. I’m only 50 pages in, but already it has a lovely momentum and a gripping sense of foreboding.\n\nMy comfort read\n\nAnything by Jonathan Coe, and if pure comfort is the aim, then his novel Mr Wilder & Me would be my pick."
