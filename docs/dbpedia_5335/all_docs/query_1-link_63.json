        "text": "Robert Leslie Franklin, Jr. “Tito” “Primo,” “Cool Rob,” “Real,” 49, was born on July 5, 1974, to loving parents Mrs. Elba Franklin-Vizcarrondo and Mr. Robert Franklin, Sr., in Mount Sinai Hospital in Manhattan, NYC. He relocated to New Haven, Connecticut, with his family.\n\nUpon moving to New Haven in a home on Blatchley Avenue, he fell in love with the Fair Haven Community. He attended St.Rose de Lima. What an adjustment from public to parochial. Living in Connecticut, he could play ball in the backyard. After graduating High School, he completed a Computer Building Class and later acquired his CDL A from NETTS tractor-trailer school. He was most recently employed as a forklift driver for Leed Himmel Industries.\n\nRobert was the proud father to daughters Ashley-Alyssa Franklin and Kayla Aleia Franklin. He would dote on their intelligence and beauty to all that would listen. To them, he passed on his affinity for basketball with both playing through high school and, ultimately, college. He was a Farnam Neighborhood House basketball alumnus, and so are his daughters. He loved Fair Haven.\n\nRobert was loved by all who encountered him. Cool Rob was a lady’s man with his shades on, and Yankee fitted with a smile for you that you felt on the inside. A great protector who loved others, he would ensure he hugged you. If Black Rob had your back, he confirmed you knew it every time he saw you. Nobody was stronger than him (per him). When you shook Black Rob’s hand for the first time, he would compress every bone possible until it felt crushed, and how you responded determined your status with him. This move was his go-to to deter any prospects from his sister or other female family members. “You Know Him?” “Who You”. Real was the first one you called when you needed help physically or emotionally, and he answered the call endlessly, and Primo was going to laugh with you and joke with you. “ARRANCA” “Look at you” Primo knew everything (or so he thought). He loved basketball and won many trophies as a child. He would finesse you to do what he wanted and then try to convince you that’s what you wanted. No matter how mad he made you when he was ready for it to be over, he bothered you until it was over.\n\nTito, as known to family, always wanted to talk. You had to listen to his preaching cause, “See, You Don’t Listen,” and then he was going to pretend he was mad but only long enough for you to let your guard down, and then he started again! He didn’t play about his female cousins, whether they were blood-related or not. He looked up to his father and always strived to be like him. From his early work ethic and dress style to his love of basketball and expensive cars. “Shabba”\n\nHe leaves behind his parents, Mr. Robert and Elba Franklin; His Daughters, Ashley Alyssa Franklin and Kayla Marie Franklin; His sister Lakisha Franklin; his Nephew, Jewell Pagan; Maternal Grandfather, Rafael Vizcarrondo; Maternal Aunts, Ruth Vizcarrondo, Diana (Samuel) Calo; Maternal Uncle Jorge Vizcarrondo; Paternal Aunts Joyce Trim; Annette Garcia and host of cousins, friends, and loved ones.\n\nHe was predeceased by his Paternal grandparents -Mr. Cephus Franklin and Pearl Enid Franklin and Maternal grandmother Margarita Pizarro-Vizcarrondo. His Paternal Aunt Annmarie Paul. His Maternal Uncle Juan Ariel Vizcarrondo\n\nHe was a loving father, son, brother, cousin, and friend during his 49 years. Rob entered eternal life in New Haven, Connecticut, on Saturday, July 15, 2023. On behalf of the Franklin-Vizcarrondo family, we would like to express our sincerest gratitude for your demonstration of love and affection during this painful time.\n\nA celebration of Robert’s life will be held on Friday July 28, 2023 at 12pm at Colonial Funerals, 86 Circular Avenue, Hamden CT 06514. Viewing in Colonial from 11am-12pm. Burial to follow at Evergreen Cemetery. Condolences may be expressed at Colonialfunerals.com."
