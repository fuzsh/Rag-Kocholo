        "text": "Eighteen months ago Australian comedian Evan Hocking became a full time comedian. Leaving a permanent job Evan “packed the job in” and took the biggest leap of faith a comedian can make in his or her early years. Since then he hasn’t looked back, performing solo shows at the 2016 and 2017 Melbourne International Comedy Festivals, with ‘Evan is a Place on Earth‘ and ‘The Morning After’, respectively.\n\nBut it’s not all pizzazz. If you’re a budding stand-up comedian, just starting out, this School of Hard Knock Knocks podcast interview with comedian Evan Hocking is great, because you’ll learn about the early challenges and stresses facing new comedians.
