        "text": "Actor and stand-up comedian Bob Saget, best known as Full House‘s lovable patriarch Danny Tanner, has died. He was 65.\n\n[pmc_inline_gallery]\n\nAccording to a tweet from the Orange County Sheriff’s Office, deputies were called to the Ritz-Carlton hotel in Orlando, Grand Lakes on Sunday “about an unresponsive man in a hotel room. The man was identified as Robert Saget and pronounced deceased on scene. Detectives found no signs of foul play or drug use in this case.”\n\nAn official cause of death remains unclear. He is survived by his wife Kelly Rizzo and children Aubrey, Jennifer Saget and Lara.\n\n“He was everything to us,” the family said in a statement to Us Weekly, “and we want you to know how much he loved his fans, performing live and bringing people from all walks of life together with laughter.”\n\nSaget starred on Full House during the entirety of its ABC run, from 1987 to 1995. He reprised his signature role in 2016 for the Netflix revival Fuller House. The sequel series ran for five seasons and ended in 2020.\n\n“Warner Bros. Television mourns the tragic loss of our dear friend Bob Saget,” the company said in a statement. “Bob was a father figure to many worldwide in his role as Danny Tanner on Full House. Our thoughts are with his family, friends, colleagues and fans.”\n\nSeries creator Jeff Franklin also released a statement on Instagram. “I wrote the role of Danny Tanner for my friend Bob Saget,” he said. “The character was kind, genuine, neurotic, a bit nerdy, a hugger with a heart of gold, and endearingly funny. That was Bob. And the X-rated sense of humor that was left out of Full House. But Bob’s charm and love-ability was the reason people embraced Danny Tanner. It was my joyful honor to be a brother of Bob’s for 42 years. Comedy icon and exceptional human being. Your spirit and your work will live on. Love you Bob.”\n\nFull House‘s John Stamos, Dave Coulier, Lori Loughlin, Candace Cameron Bure, Jodie Sweetin, Andrea Barber, Scott Weinger and Mary-Kate and Ashley Olsen have all paid their respects. Additional tributes can be found here.\n\nIn addition to his stand-up career and sitcom fame, Saget hosted America’s Funniest Home Videos, serving as host from 1989 to 1997. He also provided the voice of the future Ted Mosby on the CBS sitcom How I Met Your Mother (from 2005 to 2014), and competed in Season 4 of The Masked Singer as Squiggly Monster. In 2020, he launched a podcast titled Bob Saget’s Here For You, which released its last episode Monday, Jan 3."
