        "text": "Your host for the evening will be Anthony Lamond who is one of Australia’s hardest working and much admired Stand-Up Comedians having Hosted and Produced over 750 Shows all around Australia. He has produced shows and shared the stage with high profile Comedians such as Dave Hughes, Jimeoin, Arj Barker Fiona O’Loughlin, Peter Rowsthorn, Cal Wilson, Merrick Watts, Lawrence Mooney, The Old Fella, Chris Franklin, Heath Franklin and Bob Franklin just to name a few.\n\nWe then have two brilliant acts in store for you! Kat Davidson & Luke Heggie.\n\nComic favourite Luke Heggie is known for his dry dead pan style and the ability to deliver a brand new killer comedy show year after year. He gigs relentlessly 6 or 7 nights a week and tours the biggest comedy and arts festivals in Australia and New Zealand to sell out crowds and rave reviews. Luke also has a fan base in UK by taking his harsh but fair shows about idiots to crowds at London’s Soho Theatre.\n\nStarting out as RAW Comedy winner and going up from there Luke’s accolades include a two-time ARIA Award nominee for Best Comedy Release, the coveted ‘comic’s choice’ Piece of Wood Award at the 2017 Melbourne International Comedy Festival, the 2015 Sydney Comedy Festival’s Director’s Choice Award, the 2021 Sydney Comedy Festival Best in Fest Award, and was nominated for Best Show at the 2021 Best in Fest Award, and was nominated for Best Show at the 2021 Melbourne International Comedy Festival.\n\nKat Davidson has 24 years comedy experience, brilliant stories and keeps the laughs coming, no matter who is in the audience. Seeing Kat on stage is like visiting an old friend you haven’t met yet. She’s shared the stage with the world’s best comics (Stephen K Amos, Steven Wright, Dave Hughes to shamelessly name drop a few), tamed a shed full of drunk miners, kept a 17 year marriage off the rocks and is currently being parented by her five year old"
