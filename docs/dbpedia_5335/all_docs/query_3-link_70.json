        "text": "Robert (Bob) Franklin Workman, Jr. was born on April 4, 1939, to Robert & Dorothy Workman in Newport News, Virginia. Bob died peacefully on November 7, 2022, at Currituck Health & Rehab with his daughter and wife at his side.\n\nAfter graduation from high school, Bob did an apprenticeship at the shipyard in Newport News for 7 years. He then attended Virginia Tech and graduated with a Bachelor’s degree in Mechanical Engineering. He worked for General Electric in Wilmington, NC, for the entirety of his professional career. After retirement, he moved to OBX in 2005.\n\nBob was predeceased by his parents and his brother, Jim Workman. He is survived by his wife, Dorothy Ballance Workman, of the home, and his daughter Jenn Workman of Wilmington.\n\nWhile living in Wilmington, Bob was a faithful member of First Baptist Church for 20 years, where he loved singing in the choir. He was an avid golfer and enjoyed being on the golf course whenever possible. There was never a shortage of laughter and smiles when he was around. Bob had the sweetest heart, and his kind demeanor was the first thing you’d notice about him.\n\nA memorial service will be held at Still Waters Independent Baptist Church in Nags Head on Saturday, November 12. A visitation will be at 10:30 a.m., and the service will be at 11 a.m."
