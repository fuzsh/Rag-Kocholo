        "text": "Franklin Surname Name Meaning, Origin, History, & Etymology\n\nThis is an Anglo-Saxon occupational surname meaning “the franklin”, which means “the freeholder”, deriving from the Middle Engliush word frankelein, and earlier the Old French fraunclein, with the letter G becoming excrescent. The was feudal title during medieval times and the Middle Ages, which generally referred to a person who a freeman and holder of sizeable areas of lands, a gentlemen who ranked above the minor class, but was not as high as a knight or member of the nobility/aristocracy. Another source claims they were the equivalents of squires and meant a “superior freeholder”. In his book, Patronymica Britannica, Mark Anthony Lower, writes the following on this surname: “Properly the son or descendant of a vilein, who had become rich; but the term was also applied to farmers and country gentlemen of inconsiderable property”. A franklin was a person who owned land but was not entitled to call himself a Lord. The family first held lands and titles in Buckinghamshire, England. The Frankland family first held death in Yorkshire, where they were the Lords of the manor of Thirkelby.\n\nIt should also be noted the surname Frankland was the name of the land of the Franks (parts of modern day France, Germany, Belgium, Italy, Netherlands, Hungary, Switzerland, Spain, Austria, and other countries in Europe) given to the area by the Saxons.\n\nFrankland and Franlands are the names of locales in Devonshire, and Cumberland, England, respectively.\n\nSpelling Variations\n\nCommon spelling variants or names with similar etymologies include Frankland, Franklyn, Francklin, Franckland, and Francklyn. Rarer variations include Franklind, Franklain, Frankllin, Ffranklin, Frankulin, Franklen, and Frankling.\n\nPopularity & Geographic Distribution\n\nThe last name Franklin ranks 236th in popularity in the United Status as of the 2000 Census. The name ranks particularly high in the following nine states: Tennessee, Georgia, Illinois, Alabama, Louisiana, Missouri, Oklahoma, Mississippi, and Arkansas. The spelling variants rank in the same census as follows: Franklyn (32,791st) and Frankland (36,246th).\n\nThe surname Franklin frequency/commonness ranks as follows in the British Isles: England (390th), Scotland (1,102nd), Wales (504th), Ireland (1,603rd) and Northern Ireland (1,392nd).\n\nIn England, it ranks highest in Oxfordshire. In Scotland, the Franklin surname rankest highest in Caithness. In Wales, it ranks highest in Merionethshire. In Ireland, it ranks highest in county Wexford. In Northern Ireland, it ranks highest in Tyrone.\n\nThe name is also present throughout the remainder English speaking world: Canada (1,101st), New Zealand (468th), Australia (440th), and South Africa (2,843rd).\n\nThe 1890 book Homes of Family Names by H.B. Guppy, states the following in regard to this surname: “Oxfordshire has been for ages one of the principal homes of the Franklins. The name, which in early times, as well as in those of Shakespeare, often signified a freeholder, is also established in Bucks, Berks, Beds, Herts, Essex, and Northamptonshire, so that it may be said to occupy a somewhat circumscribed and continuous area. In the 13th century its usual forms were Frankelayn, Frankeleyn, Fraunkelayn, Fraunkeleyn, sometimes preceded by “Le” and “De,” Frankelin being rare (H. R.); it was then especially numerous in Oxfordshire, and also in fair numbers in Bucks and Wilts (H. R.), so that it would appear that in those early times, as in our own day, Oxfordshire and Bucks stood foremost amongst the English counties for their proportion of the Franklins”.\n\nEarly Bearers of the Surname\n\nThe earliest known bearer of this surname was Ralph Frankelein who was documented in the Pipe Rolls of Yorkshire in 1195 AD. A one Luke le Franckeleyn was documented in the Cambridge Feet of Fines in 1234 AD. The Hundred Rolls of 1273 AD, a census of Wales and England, known in Latin as Rotuli Hundredorum lists two bearers of this surname: Robert le Fraunkelyn (Buckinghamshire) and Simon le Fraunkeleyn (Berkshire). William le Fraunkelayn was documented in county Somerset and Richard le Fraunkelyn was recorded in county Warwickshire during the reigns of Kings Henry III and Edward I of England according to the Testa de Neville, sive Liber Feodorum. William Fronkeleyn was recorded in county Somerset in 1327 AD in Kirby’s Quest. An early marriage involving this surname was Thomas Franclyn to Frideswide Watwood at St. Michael, Cornhill in 1561 AD. Early baptisms involving this name were Helen, daughter of James Francklen at St. Jamies Clerkenwell in 1581, and Peter, also son of James, the following year.\n\nFranklin Family Tree & Franklin Genealogy\n\nFrankclin of Gonalston\n\nJohn Liell Francklin Esquire, was Justice of the Peace of Gonalston, county Nottingham and Great Barford, county Bedfordshire, who was born in 1844.
