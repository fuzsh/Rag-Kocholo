        "text": "in Richland Center & Muscoda\n\nThe Pratt Funeral and Cremation Service has been serving the Southwest Wisconsin Area since 1889. We pride ourselves on doing things the right way to assist your family in your time of need. Many things the funeral home staff does today are exactly the same way Fred Pratt did it 135 years ago. Other things are much newer such as the installation of Richland Countyâ€™s first crematory.\n\nThe Pratt Funeral and Cremation Service is proud of a second onsite chapel and dining room at 140 N. Park St., which is adjacent to the main funeral home. The chapel is smaller and is set up differently than the Pratt Memorial Chapel with a kitchen in the Pratt Community Hall. The Pratt Community Hall can be used by families for funeral lunches or community members for many different activities such as birthday parties, anniversaries, family get-togethers, showers, and many other activities. We are pleased to be able to offer our families and the community more choices.\n\nThe Pratt Funeral and Cremation Service is also pleased to offer the most consumer friendly burial insurance offered. The Pratt Funeral and Cremation Service takes the lowest commission possible and in turn passes along the highest return on investment back to our families.\n\nPrearrangements are not only about paying for the services. Many other options exist for prearrangements such as: what kind of service would you like, music you enjoy, pallbearers, what papers and radio stations you would like to have the obituary put in, would you like a lunch, would you like a military graveside (if eligible), and many other options. Our staff would be happy to assist you with any questions you may have with anything you might have concerns with.\n\nThank you.\n\nMark Jelinek"
