        "text": "loanDepot Lifetime Guarantee (\"Guarantee\") — Subject to the conditions and contact requirements outlined below, the Guarantee applies to the refinancing of an outstanding loan originated by loanDepot that is secured by the same property upon which that borrower previously received from loanDepot a loan and “loanDepot Lifetime Guarantee” certificate. The Guarantee is non-transferable and does not apply to loans obtained to purchase a new property, new loans that result in the creation of a separate lien on the current property (i.e., a “home equity loan”), renovation loans, bond loan programs, and down payment assistance programs. The Guarantee also does not apply to loans applied for through third parties (e.g., Lending Tree) or originated through loanDepot’s Wholesale division. The Guarantee may only be used by submitting an application directly to loanDepot.\n\nFor Guarantees issued on or after January 1, 2019, the Guarantee may not be redeemed within 12 calendar months of the Date Issued. The ability to redeem the Guarantee in part or in whole also is subject to future changes in Federal or state law, or investor or guarantor restrictions on refinancing the existing loan. loanDepot cannot guarantee that the borrower will be approved for a future loan, the interest rate for a future loan, or the future appraised value of the home. The borrower’s ability to qualify for a future loan will be subject to the loan program terms and conditions available at that time. For future loans meeting the above requirements and which are successfully closed, no lender fee will be charged. “Lender fee” does not include discount points associated with the loan transaction. Terms and conditions are subject to change without notice."
