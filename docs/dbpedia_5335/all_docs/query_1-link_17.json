        "text": "Robert (Bob) Franklin died on Wednesday, Sept. 19 at his home in Vineyard Haven. He was 92.\n\nBob was born in Brooklyn, N.Y. on July 6, 1926 to Theodore and Rose Franklin (Levis). He moved to Los Angeles in 1936 where he completed high school before joining the Navy in 1944. He served aboard the USS Helena in the Pacific theatre as a radar and communications technician until the end of World War II.\n\nAfter the war, Bob attended UCLA followed by BU medical school. In Boston he met and married Helen Grace Carlson in 1951. He interned in pediatrics at Boston City Hospital and at the University of Illinois. Bob returned to the Boston area in 1954, setting up a pediatrics practice in Westwood where he lived and worked until his semi-retirement in 1999. During that time, Bob was active in community affairs, served as chief of staff at the Norwood Hospital and trained new physicians as an associate clinical professor of pediatrics at his alma mater.\n\nIn 1999, Bob and Grace moved to Martha’s Vineyard, where the family had vacationed for many years. There, Bob continued his practice of pediatrics on a part-time basis, also serving on the town of Tisbury’s board of health and finance committee for several years, until retiring in 2014 at the age of 88.\n\nBob traveled extensively during his life, within the US and Europe, Russia and China, with his wife Grace, who died in 2006, and later with Jacquie. He enjoyed tennis, golf, sailing and classical music, especially by the Boston Symphony Orchestra. Bob also was an avid bridge player.\n\nHe is survived by his dear friend, Jacqueline (Jacquie) Renear; daughter, Martha Braunstein; son, Jeffrey Franklin; grandchildren, Eric Braunstein and wife, Lauren Braunstein, and Laura Braunstein-Freiberg and husband Scott Freiberg; and their daughters, his great-grandchildren, Farrah and Bianca Freiberg.\n\nBob was loved by his family, friends and patients and respected by his colleagues. Plans for a memorial service will be announced."
