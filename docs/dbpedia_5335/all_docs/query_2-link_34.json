        "text": "Robert Lee Franklin Jr., affectionately known as “Bobby”, “Baub,” and “Mellow 1,” was born in Denver, Colorado on November 18, 1947, from the union of Robert Lee Franklin, Sr. and LaVonne Gloria Anderson. He was the younger of their two children and attended Cole Junior High and East High School in the Denver Public School system. Baub and Uncle Reesie were raised very closely with their cousins. Big Momma, Aunt Bitsy and Aunt Rett made sure that all the kids spent time together. In 2009, Baub found companionship with Dildred “DeDe” Carter, who was his partner and best friend until his final days.\n\nBorn with an entrepreneurial spirit, at just ten years old, he was already proving resourceful in finding ways to earn money and contribute to his parents’ household. He shoveled snow in the winter, mowed lawns in the summer; whatever he could do to earn money. Baub was an avid boxer in his teens and never lost his enthusiasm for the sport. Extremely passionate about foreign languages, he learned German and Spanish on his own and was fluent in both.\n\nBaub served in the U.S. Army during the Vietnam era and earned his Associates Degree in psychology soon after.\n\nAs an adult, Baub used his entrepreneurial talents to manage several types of businesses — including a car dealership, pawn shop, furniture store, and escort services. He had an amazing mind for business and never hesitated to share his wealth of knowledge with anyone who would listen. Baub was very charismatic; he had a way of making you feel like you were really being listened to no matter the subject. He made you feel he truly cared. To his children, he will be remembered as the single most intelligent person they encountered. Family was very important to Baub. It was important for him to leave a legacy for his children, and grandchildren.\n\nBaub was very active in the East Denver Community. He mentored many of the young men and women in his neighborhood, earning him the endearing term, “Uncle Baub.” He also volunteered his time teaching G.E.D. classes.\n\nBaub was called home on Friday, February 12, 2021. He leaves to cherish his memory: wife, Dildred “DeDe” Carter; his children: Barbara Jo (Jarrod), Marlon (Cinda), Alecia, Peggy “LaNiece” (Spencer), Robert III (Kris), Solitaire, Brandon (Dina), Brittney, Briana, Martagus, Jayrodd, Taylor, Ernestine, Tony, Anthony and Olian; brother, Maurice; 27 grandchildren and 15 great-grandchildren; a host of cousins, surrogate children, and lifetime friends. He was preceded in death by his wife, Stephanie Jane and son, Jaben."
