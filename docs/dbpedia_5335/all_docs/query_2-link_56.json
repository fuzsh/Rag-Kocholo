        "text": "Jeffery Robert Franklin, 73 of Lexington, Georgia passed away December 29 2023 at his family residence.\n\nHe was born August 6 1951 in Lexington, Georgia to Dorine & Martin Franklin and raised in Carlton, Georgia.\n\nHe is proceeded in death by parents; Dorine & Martin Franklin, & wife Peggy Franklin. He is survived by sisters Hilda Huguley and Hazel Forrester; brother Dennis Franklin; daughters Sylvia Kort and Cynthia Johnson; granddaughter McKenzie Franklin; grandsons Martin Johnson, Brandon Kort & Kylar Butler.\n\nHe worked with his sister Hilda Huguley at Northeast Monuments & Rock shed for some time. Then proceeded to pursue a career in outdoor sports as a hunting and fisherman guide & operated a bait shop in Elberton, Georgia.\n\nJeff's passion began at a very young age when he learned to hunt and fish along his father in North Georgia. Jeff had an exquisite eye for detail and could spot wildlife from miles away. He was an avid hunter and fisher, he enjoyed boating on the rivers and lakes of Georgia. He was the happiest on the river, in nature surrounded by Georgia wildlife, he could tell you a long list of facts about. He was also considered a gun nut who was deeply involved in firearms. In his later years he enjoyed sitting around the campfires with family, telling tales, spending time with his grand babies, and was passionate about his grocery shopping."
