        "text": "Robert “Bob” Franklin Bates, 76, of Winchester, Virginia passed away Tuesday, April 6, 2021 at the Winchester Medical Center.\n\nBob was born May 4, 1944 in San Francisco, California the son of the late Franklin W. Bates and Marjorie K. (Shetland) Bates. Bob enjoyed traveling and his love of traveling started at a young age when he went to school in Europe. He was a history buff and was a very patient, giving, generous and kind soul who would always step in to help with whatever needed to be done or handled. You could always find Bob on the Walking Mall in Winchester with his dog Spike and he enjoyed going to the Berryville S.P.C.A. and Winchester Dog Park to visit with the animals.\n\nAbove all else, Bob took great pride in his granddaughter’s accomplishments and successes in their lives.\n\nBob is survived by his son Lucas Franklin Bates (Tammy); step daughters Lori Gibson and Kate Warfield; grandchildren Ashley Bates, Arin Bates, Gwen Layman and Ryley Warfield; his sister Carolyn Bonner (Emmitt) and their two children Jeannette and Ian; his dear friend Clare Hajek and of course his miniature pincher dog Spike.\n\nIn addition to his parents he was also preceded in death by his granddaughter Sarah Gibson and his loving companion Carol Gibson.\n\nServices and interment will be private."
