This was taken as we gathered for his funeral.\n\n“Though Bob wasn’t there physically, his spirit was unmistakably present, wrapping us in warmth and shared memories that drew both laughter and tears.\n\n“That day, each of us felt the weight of his absence and the strength of the bond he nurtured among us.\n\n“Bob was the heart of our ‘Full House’ family. His legacy of kindness and compassion was evident in the faces around me, (on Dumbo) in the gentle ways we supported one another, echoing the love he always extended. We celebrated a life that was a true gift to us all.”\n\nHe continued: “Bob, you are with us in every joke we share and every hug we give.\n\n“Rest in peace, dear friend. Your family misses you more than words can say.”\n\nFellow cast members also shared their own tributes with Sweetin writing “Happy Birthday, @bobsaget. There’s not a day I don’t think of you” alongside a video montage of photos of the cast.\n\nBure and Coulier also remembered the late actor with their own videos featuring clips from their days on the show.\n\nSinger John Mayer posted a photo of him with Saget on Instagram as well, writing: “I miss you the most when I’m exhausted and I just want to talk to my friend.”\n\nHe added: “We all miss you. Loss may be out of our control, but remembrance is our act of defiance. And we will never forget you. Love you Bob. Happy Birthday.”"
