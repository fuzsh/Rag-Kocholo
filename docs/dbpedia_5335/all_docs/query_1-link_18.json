        "text": "About My Paintings\n\nPastel is of pure paint pigment in the form of a stick. The pigment is held together by a binder. The pigments are the same ones used in oil paint. Pastel paintings completed hundredes of years ago still look like they did when first done.\n\nPastels being a dry paint pigment must be framed under glass to protect it from smearing. Each painting of mine is completed on museum grade paper mounted on an acid free foam core board.\n\nDuring framing, a 1/8-inch spacer is installed between the glass adn painting. The glass is of a non-glare which reduces reflection from that of regular glass. The painting also is sealed in the back by a backing paper and a wire installed for hanging.\n\nBiography\n\nAward-winning, pastel artist, Bob Franklin, conveys the heart and soul of the southwest culture in his vibrant paintings. A self-taught artist, Bob was born in Philadelphia and spent much of his life on the east coast before moving to Texas in 1990, where he was soon captivated by the colorful southwestern culture and traditions.\n\nPhotographing and painting of the people, missions, churches and artifacts became a consuming passion and the focus of his spiritual journey. Bob’s floral paintings are inspired by vases purchased throughout his travels."
