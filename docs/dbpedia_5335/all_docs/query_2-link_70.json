        "text": "Franklin History, Family Crest & Coats of Arms\n\nOrigins Available:\n\nEngland\n\nIreland\n\nThe Franklin family name dates back to the ancient Anglo-Saxon culture of Britain. The name comes from when an early member worked as a landowner who was not a member of the nobility. Further research revealed that the name is derived from the Old French word fraunclein, which became frankeleyn in Old English, and denoted rank within the feudal system; a person \"superior freeholder,\" next below gentlemen in dignity, now called country Squires. Moreover England is so filled and replenished with landed menne, that therein the smallest thorpe can not be found wherin dwelleth not a knight or an esquire, or such a householder as is there commonly called a Franklin, enriched with great possessions, and also other freeholders, and many yeomen, able for their livelyhood to make a jury in form aforementioned.\" 1\n\nChaucer mentions in his famous Canterbury Tales:\n\n\"A Franklin was in this companie,\n\nWhite was his beard, as is the dayesie.\"\n\nLoading...\n\nEarly Origins of the Franklin family\n\nThe surname Franklin was first found in \"Oxfordshire has been for ages one of the principal homes of the Franklins. The name, which in early times, as well as in those of Shakespeare, often signified a freeholder, is also established in Bucks, Berks, Beds, Herts, Essex, and Northamptonshire, so that it may be said to occupy a somewhat circumscribed and continuous area. In the 13th century its usual forms were Frankelayn, Frankeleyn, Fraunkelayn, Fraunkeleyn, sometimes preceded by \"Le\" and \"De,\" Frankelin being rare; it was then especially numerous in Oxfordshire, and also in fair numbers in Bucks and Wilts, so that it would appear that in those early times, as in our own day, Oxfordshire and Bucks stood foremost amongst the English counties for their proportion of the Franklins.\" 2\n\nEarly rolls underline the wide spellings in use through the ages: Ralph Frankelem was listed in the Pipe Rolls of Yorkshire in 1195; Luke le Franckeleyn in the Feet of Fines for Cambridgeshire in 1234; Roger le Franklyn in the Hundredorum Rolls for Dorset in 1274; and John ffranklyng was recorded in 1522. 3\n\nThe famed Benjamin Franklin (1706-1790) was the son of Josiah Franklin Sr. (1657-1745), an English businessman from Ecton, Northamptonshire. Josiah emigrated to the American colonies in 1682 and married twice, having 17 children. Benjamin was Josiah Franklin's fifteenth child.\n\nLoading...\n\nEarly History of the Franklin family\n\nThis web page shows only a small excerpt of our Franklin research.

Before English spelling became standardized over the last few hundred years, spelling variations in names were a common occurrence. As the English language changed in the Middle Ages, absorbing pieces of Latin and French, as well as other languages, the spelling of people's names also changed considerably, even over a single lifetime. Many variations of the name Franklin have been found, including Franklyn, Francklyn, Francklin, Franklin, Franklind and many more.\n\nLoading...\n\nEarly Notables of the Franklin family\n\nNotables of this surname at this time include:\n\nRobert Franklin (1630-1684), an English nonconformist divine\n\nSir Richard Franklin, 1st Baronet (1630-1685), an English landowner and politician, Member of Parliament for Hertfordshire (1661-1679)\n\nFranklin World Ranking\n\nIn the United States, the name Franklin is the 199th most popular surname with an estimated 126,837 people with that name. 4 However, in Australia, the name Franklin is ranked the 453rd most popular surname with an estimated 8,341 people with that name. 5 And in New Zealand, the name Franklin is the 458th popular surname with an estimated 1,506 people with that name. 6 The United Kingdom ranks Franklin as 431st with 14,920 people. 7\n\nMigration of the Franklin family to Ireland\n\nSome of the Franklin family moved to Ireland, but this topic is not covered in this excerpt.\n\nAnother 30 words (2 lines of text) about their life in Ireland is included in all our PDF Extended History products and printed products wherever possible.\n\nLoading...\n\nFranklin migration to the United States +\n\nIn an attempt to escape the chaos experienced in England, many English families boarded overcrowded and diseased ships sailing for the shores of North America and other British colonies. Those families hardy enough, and lucky enough, to make the passage intact were rewarded with land and a social environment less prone to religious and political persecution. Many of these families became important contributors to the young colonies in which they settled. Early immigration and passenger lists have documented some of the first Franklins to arrive on North American shores:\n\nFranklin Settlers in United States in the 17th Century\n\nJosiah Franklin, who settled in Boston Massachusetts in 1630\n\nHenry Franklin, who arrived in Virginia in 1634 8\n\nWilliam Franklin, who landed in New England in 1634 aboard the ship \"Mary & John\" 8\n\nHenry Franklin who settled in Virginia in 1635\n\nJohn Franklin, who settled in Virginia in 1651\n\n...

By 1838, the British New Zealand Company had begun buying land from the Maori tribes, and selling it to settlers, and, after the Treaty of Waitangi in 1840, many British families set out on the arduous six month journey from Britain to Aotearoa to start a new life.

They made many attempts but failed in some to establish settlements on the Islands including Saint Lucia and Grenada. By 1627 they had managed to establish settlements on St. Kitts (St. Christopher) and Barbados, but by 1641 the Spanish had moved in and destroyed some of these including those at Providence Island. The British continued to expand the settlements including setting the First Federation in the British West Indies by 1674; some of the islands include Barbados, Bermuda, Cayman Island, Turks and Caicos, Jamaica and Belize then known as British Honduras. By the 1960's many of the islands became independent after the West Indies Federation which existed from 1958 to 1962 failed due to internal political conflicts. After this a number of Eastern Caribbean islands formed a free association. 14\n\nFranklin Settlers in West Indies in the 17th Century\n\nJonathan Franklin, aged 17, who arrived in Barbados in 1635 8\n\nMr. Jonathan Franklin, (b. 1618), aged 17, British settler travelling from London, England aboard the ship \"Alexander\" arriving in Barbados in 1635 15\n\nContemporary Notables of the name Franklin (post 1700) +\n\nJohn Hope Franklin (1915-2009), American historian of the United States and former president of Phi Beta Kappa, the Organization of American Historians, the American Historical Association, and the Southern Historical Association, recipient of the Presidential Medal of Freedom\n\nAretha Louise Franklin (1942-2018), American singer, songwriter, pianist and recipient of the Presidential Medal of Freedom\n\nBenjamin Franklin (1706-1790), American statesman, scientist, philosopher, and publisher, the most well-known Founding Father of the United States\n\nSir John Franklin (1786-1847), British Arctic explorer, Lieutenant-Governor of Van Diemen's Land from 1837 to 1843; he disappeared on his last expedition, attempting to chart and navigate the Northwest Passage 16\n\nRichard Kimber Franklin (1936-2023), English actor, writer, director and political activist, perhaps best known for his portrayal of Captain Mike Yates of UNIT in Doctor Who from 1971 until 1974\n\nColin Ellis Franklin MA, FSA (1923-2020), English writer, bibliographer, book-collector and antiquarian bookseller from Notting Hill, London\n\nRosalind Elsie Franklin (1920-1958), British biophysicist, physicist, chemist, biologist, and X-ray crystallographer\n\nHoward Bruce Franklin (1934-2024), American cultural historian and scholar who wrote or edited twenty books and three hundred professional articles, awarded the Pearson-Bode Prize for Lifetime Achievement in American Studies in 2008\n\nJames McWillie Franklin FRSC (1942-2024), Canadian geologist, awarded the Selwyn G.

Mottoes first began to be shown with arms in the 14th and 15th centuries, but were not in general use until the 17th century. Thus the oldest coats of arms generally do not include a motto. Mottoes seldom form part of the grant of arms: Under most heraldic authorities, a motto is an optional component of the coat of arms, and can be added to or changed at will; many families have chosen not to display a motto.\n\nMotto: Pro rege et patria\n\nMotto Translation: For King and country.\n\nSuggested Readings for the name Franklin +\n\nAncestors and Descendants of My Raymoure, Hubbell, Franklin, Osborne Grandparents: Includes 40+ Connecting Lines by Dorothy Raymoure.\n\nCook's Crier, The Franklin's Fireplace by Betty Harvey Williams.\n\nCitations +\n\nArthur, William , An Etymological Dictionary of Family and Christian Names.
