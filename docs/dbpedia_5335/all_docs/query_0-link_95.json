        "text": "WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. â€” A death investigation report was released Monday by the Orange County Sheriff's Office following the passing of longtime comedian Bob Saget.\n\nIt stated that Saget's family members on Sunday contacted security at the Ritz-Carlton in Orlando where he was staying to check on his well-being after being unable to reach him.\n\nThe report said a security member knocked on the door of Saget's room several times and attempted to gain entry. When the security team member later gained access to the room, he noted that all the lights were off.\n\nSecurity found Saget in his bed and stated that the comedian was \"cold to the touch, yellow and clammy.\"\n\nThe security member checked to see if Saget was breathing and for a pulse but none were detected, prompting a call to 911.\n\nOrange County Fire Rescue arrived and Saget was pronounced dead at 4:18 p.m.\n\nThe sheriff's office report said there were no signs of foul play and the room was orderly.\n\nMORE: Bob Saget on tour in Florida at time of death\n\nSaget was found with his left arm across his chest while his right arm was resting on the bed. No signs of trauma were seen, according to investigators.\n\nThe report said the comedian had used his room key to enter his room at 2:17 a.m. Sunday.\n\nHotel management contacted Saget's wife, Kelly Rizzo, to notify her of his death.\n\nThe cause of death has not been released.\n\nComedian Gilbert Gottfried shocked by Bob Saget's death\n\nComedian mourns Saget's death\n\nSaget had just kicked off a national tour and was scheduled to perform in West Palm Beach later this month.\n\nComedian Gilbert Gottfried spoke Monday about the passing of his longtime friend.\n\n\"A great guy and a really funny guy,\" Gottfried said. \"I just spoke to him on the phone a few days ago, which makes it more surreal.\"\n\nDuring his conversation with Saget, Gottfried said there was no indication that something might be amiss.\n\n\"He sounded great. He sounded like his old self,\" Gottfried said.\n\nSaget was found unresponsive in his hotel room at the Ritz-Carlton in Orlando. The sheriff's office said they do not suspect foul play or drug use in Saget's death.\n\n\"I was having dinner and [comedian] Jeff Ross called me, and he said, 'I've got some sad news, Bob Saget died,'\" Gottfried said.\n\nLike many people, the comedian said he is still trying to make sense of it all.\n\n\"I thought, 'Oh, it's a sick joke,' and I was waiting for the punch line,\" Gottfried said. \"And I'm waiting there, and then there's no punch line to it,\" Gottfried said.\n\nSaget was no stranger to the West Palm Beach area, visiting the city's Improv Comedy Club on multiple occasions.\n\nHe became a household name for this portrayal of Danny Tanner on the long-running ABC sitcom \"Full House\" and as the host of \"America's Funniest Home Videos.\"\n\n\"His friends will all remember him as a fun guy to be with, a great guy and really quick-witted,\" Gottfried said. \"The audience loved his quick wit and his warmth that came through on the TV shows.\"\n\nSaget was 65 years old and leaves behind a wife and three daughters.\n\n\"It still feels like a shock, and it doesn't feel at all real,\" Gottfried said."
