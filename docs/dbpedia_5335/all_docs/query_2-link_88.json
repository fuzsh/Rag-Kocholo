        "text": "Robert \"Rob\" Ennis, 57 of Pensacola, Florida formerly of Independence, Ky passed away on July 25, 2024 at his home. He grew up in Latonia, Ky and was a graduate of Holy Cross High School in 1985. Per his family, Rob enjoyed life. There was rarely a time he wasn't trying to make everyone laugh or try to put a smile on your face. \"He was a Character\"! Being a member of Transformation Church in Pensacola, he enjoyed serving the community by going out and feeding the homeless . He enjoyed the outdoors especially when it came to fishing. He loved showing off his cooking skills by sending pictures to his siblings of \"whats for dinner\". He worked as a National Sales Consultant for Smith and Nephew as well as Genzyme Biomatrix, and had his own medical consulting firm. Most of all Rob loved to spend time with his family. He was preceded in death by his Wife, Melissa Glover Ennis in 2002, his Parents, Franklin and Hettie Louise Ennis and a Sister, Kelly Ennis. Rob is survived by his Children, Jessica Warren and Clay (Chloe) Ennis, Sisters; Cathy Dowell and Shelly Bingle (George); Brother, Doug Ennis; Grandchildren, Logan, Eli, Madelynn and Camryn; Many Nieces, Nephews and Cousins.
