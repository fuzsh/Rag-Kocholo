        "text": "As Carlos Santana’s manager, Greg DiGiovine was instrumental in the revival of the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame guitarist’s career, playing a major role in the deal that led to Santana’s 1999 blockbuster album “Supernatural,” one of the bestselling records of all time and the winner of eight Grammy awards.\n\nAfter more than 30 years in the music business, which included managing Grammy-winning Marin record producer Narada Michael Walden and the late jazz drummer Tony Williams, DiGiovine reinvented himself as Tony Tutto, the gregarious proprietor of a popular vegetarian pizzeria — first in Mill Valley and later in Ross — that one reviewer hailed as “a much-beloved neighborhood institution.”\n\nSadly, the worlds of music and food lost one of their most quietly charismatic characters when DiGiovine died July 16 at his Larkspur home with Lynn, his wife of 44 years, by his side. Friends said the cause of death was glioblastoma, brain cancer. He was 72.\n\n‘The rest is history’\n\nIn the mid-1990s, Santana, who hadn’t had a hit record since the 1970s, hired DiGiovine to head up a management team tasked with getting Santana’s music back on the radio and into the pop music mainstream.\n\nDiGiovine suggested that he work again with Arista Records president Clive Davis, who had first signed Santana to Columbia Records, the label that launched his first hit albums and singles after the Santana band’s breakthrough performance at Woodstock.\n\nWith the hope that lightning would strike twice, DiGiovine set up a meeting with Davis that led to the guitarist signing with Arista for an album that would become the multi-platinum smash “Supernatural.”\n\n“It was life-changing for Carlos,” said Deborah Santana, Santana’s former wife, who was managing the Santana office at the time. “Greg set up the meeting and made it all happen. The rest is history.”\n\nThe explosive success of “Supernatural” not only got Santana back on the radio, topping the Billboard Hot 100 chart for 12 weeks, it turned him into a global superstar.\n\n“I knew Greg had people skills,” said Carlos Santana, speaking by phone from his home in Las Vegas. “You need a middleman, a person to interpret what each other is saying in meetings. And I knew in my heart that I needed Greg to do that with Clive.”\n\nIn his mind, it was no coincidence that DiGiovine’s talent in the kitchen translated so seamlessly to his skills in the boardroom.\n\n“You know how chefs blend ingredients, nutrients, components and elements to cook a delicious meal,” he said. “To me, that’s what Greg brought to ‘Supernatural.’ He brought these beautiful attributes and qualities that made it possible for me and Clive to believe that we could do this thing. It turned out to be a wonderful experience.”\n\nBut it wasn’t an easy one. Davis insisted on having creative input. And “Supernatural” wasn’t a straightforward band album. It featured the guitarist collaborating with a host of contemporary guest artists, most notably Matchbox Twenty singer Rob Thomas, Lauryn Hill, Dave Matthews and Eric Clapton. Each one required its own contracts and negotiations and hand-holding.\n\n“His role was to talk to the artists and the managers and the accountants, and he would deal with all that in a very gracious, beautiful way,” Carlos Santana said. “He created an atmosphere where we could all trust each other and create this masterpiece that is ‘Supernatural.’”\n\nMarin drummer and record producer Narada Michael Walden was among those who recommended DiGiovine for the job with Santana. He and DiGiovine had begun their music careers together after meeting in Miami when they were both 19. As Walden’s roadie and drum tech, DiGiovine traveled the world on tour with Jeff Beck and with guitarist John McLaughlin’s Mahavishnu Orchestra.\n\nThrough McLaughlin, DiGiovine, Walden and later Santana became disciples of guru Sri Chinmoy, an Indian spiritual leader and meditation teacher.\n\n“Guru gave Greg his spiritual name, Sambhava, which means new creation,” Walden said. “We knew we needed a new way of life because the drugs way would kill us, so we both elected to have more spiritual lives. We were best of friends and did everything together.”\n\nIt was Chinmoy who recommended that DiGiovine become Walden’s manager after Walden was signed to a solo career, making albums for Atlantic Records and Warner Bros.\n\nAfter they both moved to Marin, DiGiovine helped Walden set up Tarpan Studios in San Rafael, where Walden enjoyed Grammy-winning success, producing hit records by Aretha Franklin, Whitney Houston, Mariah Carey and other major pop and R&B singers.\n\n“People actually liked that Greg was so genuine,” Walden said. “It brought their defenses down, even the bigshots I remember dealing with. He could pull your guard down by being so real.”\n\nAfter 14 years in Marin, DiGiovine took a break from the stress of the music business, moving with his wife to her native Hawaii, where he drove a cab for his father-in-law’s taxi company in Honolulu. He prided himself on driving some 40,000 passengers, more than half of them handicapped or on government assistance. He returned to the mainland to work for Santana.\n\n‘Tony Tutto is my client’\n\nDiGiovine grew up in the suburbs of Maryland, the eldest of six children in an Italian family. When he was flying high in the music business, he came down to earth by baking pizzas for his friends, using organic ingredients sourced from the Sunday Farmers Market at the Marin Civic Center. When he and Santana parted ways, he turned his hobby into a business, opening Tony Tutto Pizza on East Blithedale Avenue in Mill Valley in 2008.\n\nAfter working anonymously behind the scenes in the music business for so long, boosting the careers of others, he suddenly found himself the star of his own show, the gregarious front man Tony Tutto, a restaurateur who thought of every pizza as a song.\n\nHe delighted in naming his pies with a musical flavor: “A Love Supreme” was a margarita inspired by the classic John Coltrane jazz album. The red pepper-flaked “Bitches Brew” honored hot-tempered Miles Davis. He called his bianca pizza “A Whiter Shade of Pale” after the 1967 Procol Harum hit. “Smokey,” named after Smokey Robinson, was topped with smoked mozzarella. And “Peter, Paul and Pesto” needed no explanation.\n\n“I spent 30 years helping other people realize their dreams and goals and aspirations, and I’ve been happy in that role,” he told me when I interviewed him shortly after he opened for business. “But creatively, this is the closest I’ve ever gotten to being a musician. And now Tony Tutto is my client.”\n\nIn an only-in-Marin coincidence, his first customer was the Grateful Dead’s Bob Weir. He soon attracted a cult following that included rocker Sammy Hagar, tennis champ Brad Gilbert and comedian Dana Carvey. In a Marinscope article, a customer wrote that the pizzeria gives the neighborhood “a wonderful front porch kind of inviting atmosphere.”\n\nAfter nine years, Tony Tutto was pushed out after a San Francisco real estate company razed the building and built a new one in its place for a new restaurant and retail space.\n\n“I’m going to pursue a new location, that’s my first choice,” he said when I wrote about his closing. “But if I never make another pizza again, I’m the happiest person in the world.”\n\nHe would make many more pizzas after that. In 2018, Tony Tutto reopened in what DiGiovine called “a really sweet little spot” in Ross across from the grassy Ross Common. It quickly became a local favorite.\n\nAfter he became ill, he sold the restaurant, which continues to operate as Tony Tutto Pizza under a new owner.\n\nHearing that DiGiovine was not well, Walden had one last talk with his longtime manager and friend.\n\n“He said, ‘I want to thank you for being good to me just as I was good to you,’” Walden said. “He said, ‘I’m always proud of you, your children, your family, all the things you’re doing.’ He was always encouraging me and I was the same with him. He was the best friend I ever had in the music business and all through my life. We were best of friends right until the end. He was a godsend.”\n\nContact Paul Liberatore at p.liberatore@comcast.net"
