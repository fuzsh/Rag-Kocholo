I've toured with such bands as Switchfoot, Newsboys, Third Day, Skillet, Mercy Me, Jeremy Camp, etc. etc. I currently tour with comedian Tim Hawkins. You can find tons of my clips by just googling my name or by listening to XM or Pandora. I can and have performed at every kind of gig possible but I'd like to do just one more...yours."
