There are two Bob Franklin's: one born in Hillingdon who wrote the 1970 'New Worlds' story, and the one born in 1965 in London, raised in Wales and now living in Australia. I received a mail from David Langford saying "Something for you and ISFDB: Chris Priest tells me that his old UK friend Bob Franklin has died. Franklin wrote the 1970 =New Worlds= story cited in the ISFDB entry, but everything else in the entry (with the posssible exception of the Hillingdon birthplace) seems to be about a much younger Australian author with the same name"

I established that the Australian Bob Franklin was born in Hillingdon, England, UK before moving to Wales. Of the UK Bob Franklin David Langford wrote me

â€¢ Bob Franklin, UK fan in the 1960s whose one published sf story was 'Cinnabar Balloon Tautology' (March 1970 New Worlds), died on 22 February. Chris Priest remembers him as '... an old friend of mine from the 1960s. He was close to me and Graham Hall, and was on the fringes of the New Worlds group.' --Dirk P Broer 20:38, 2 March 2012 (UTC)

Steven H Silver's In Memoriam: 2012 on SF Site, credits Bob_Franklin_(I) with the two Borderlands stores. That is not correct per Bob Franklin (the comedian) biography on his agent's website. -- JLaTondre (talk) 14:56, 1 March 2013 (UTC)
