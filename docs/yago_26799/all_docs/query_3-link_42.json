        "text": "A Brand New 4K Restoration! He’s pure evil… pure power… pure terror! RawHead Rex is a demon, alive for millennia, trapped in the depths of hell, and waiting for release. He is held by an ancient seal, imprisoned for centuries in a barren field near the hamlet of Rathmore, Ireland. In time, this gruesome legacy has been forgotten, dismissed as an odd pre-Christian myth until Tom Garron (Donal McCann, December Bride) decides to plow the field his ancestors knew better than to disturb. The seal is broken and an unspeakable evil is unleashed - on a rampage of blood and lust. Howard Hallenbeck (David Dukes, Gods and Monsters), an American historian on a working vacation with his family, discovers on the stained glass windows of a local church a series of scenes illustrating the reign of terror of RawHead Rex, but the one piece of glass depicting the defeat of the monster is missing. RawHead Rex is on the loose, and he is insatiable as Howard is desperately races against time for a way to stop the vicious monster. Directed by George Pavlou (Transmutations) with a screenplay by horror legend Clive Barker (Hellraiser, Candyman, Nightbreed, Lord of Illusions).\n\nPress & Exhibitors\n\nBelow please find additional information and promotional materials for this film.
