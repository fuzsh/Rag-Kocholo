        "text": "Judgment can’t be worse than some of these sequels, right? …Right?!\n\nSPOILER WARNING\n\nAh, yes. Pinhead. Growing up, I had the joy of going to Blockbuster once a week or so to rent movies. Every time, I’d look at the horror section with fascination. I was too scared to ever rent any of the movies, mind you, but I liked to browse at a safe distance. There were a few movies that I looked at that stuck with me. One was Killer Klowns From Outer Space, and the other was, as you might’ve suspected, Hellraiser. I remember distinctly the covers for Inferno and Hellworld. It wouldn’t be until I got a Netflix subscription that I ever got acquainted with Clive Barker’s brain child. I was sixteen when I watched all nine of the Hellraiser movies. With Hellraiser: Judgment coming soon and highly anticipated by yours truly, I wanted to take a look at this horror franchise, the very first that I got into.\n\nHellraiser\n\nLook, this one’s a no-brainer. It’s the best acted, most disturbing (by far!), and most unique of the bunch. Clive Barker brings his twisted novel to life here, and it’s not just the best movie in the franchise, but a contender for best horror film of 1987, which is no small feat when you consider The Lost Boys, Evil Dead II, Nightmare on Elm Street 3, Creepshow 2, Near Dark, Monster Squad, and Prince of Darkness ALL CAME OUT THIS YEAR. Yeah, the late 80’s were a special time in cinema. It’s surprising when one considers that Barker had no serious experience working in film. He admits, “[I] didn’t know the difference between a 10-milimeter lens and a 35-milimeter lens. If you’d shown me a plate of spaghetti and said that was a lens, I might have believed you.” The lack of experience doesn’t translate to the screen, but the movie does suffer in a few spots. For one thing, “The Engineer” creature is utterly ridiculous and takes away from an otherwise effective horror movie not once, but twice!\n\nSpeaking of effective, the Cenobites are amazing works of practical makeup effects. Chatterer and Butterball in particular are worthy of high praise. Doug Bradley steals the show as Pinhead, the leader of the extra-dimensional beings. He serves up quotable line after quotable line and is truly terrifying. Christopher Young’s score perfectly fits in this movie, unlike his work in Nightmare on Elm Street II. The main theme is beautiful and blends well with the bloody hooks and dismembered bodies.\n\nIn my honest opinion, this is the only movie in the franchise I would highly recommend. It only goes downhill from here.\n\nHellraiser II: Hellbound\n\nNo Cliver Barker this time, but we still have the cast of the first one and Christopher Young doing the music. Great, so how do you top the first one? Well, you go to the other side where the Cenobites reside. What’s the worst that could happen? This movie, despite being pretty inferior to the first on a technical level, is almost as enjoyable as it! No joke. Hellbound places Kirsty, the protagonist of the first movie, in a mental asylum. The place is run by Dr. Channard, a man obsessed with the secrets of the Lament Configuration, the box that summons the Cenobites. After he revives Kirsty’s mother in a horribly bloody ritual, he is plunged into a world of pain and LSD. This movie is a trip. The imagery is so out there at times. There’s a room where Frank is tortured by three women on beds that he can’t touch. They start bleeding at one point and crying out in agony. Kirsty’s mom gets sucked out her skin then her daughter wears it to seduce the Channard Cenobite. The Leviathan is a crystal that shoots out black beams that causes people to hallucinate out of their damn gourds. It’s wild. This is a case of bigger not necessarily being better, but being enjoyable for sure.\n\nChristopher Young’s score is even better than the first one. I think a lot of that has to do with having to score all these wild scenes. The mental asylum is convincing enough, but the Labyrinth of Hell is not always convincing. A lot of times, it feels the actors are running around the same few hallways. Rarely do you get the sense that they’re ever out in the M. C. Escher-inspired maze. The budget cuts the movie received are quite apparent. It’s disappointing, but they made the movie work in spite of those issues.\n\nIf you liked the first one and think it would’ve been better with a healthy dose of drugs, give this one a watch.\n\nHellraiser III: Hell on Earth\n\nThis is the campiest of the Hellraiser movies, and unfortunately the quality is really taking a nosedive. You’ve still got the presence of Doug Bradley as well as some interesting makeup effects, but this feels like a complete departure from the first two tonally. Part of that is Young’s absence. On the other hand, a score from him would’ve felt out of place in this movie. The movie at least attempts to resolve the character of Pinhead after his death in Hellbound. His human side has been detached from the Cenobite and now the Cenobite him is without principle, seeking only to wreak havoc on humanity. Thus, the kill count is higher than any other Hellraiser movie.\n\nI’m going to describe a single scene from this movie that perfectly encapsulates all that is good and bad with it:\n\nA Cenobite with a camera lens for an eye approaches Joey, the main character. He blows up a shop display of TVs with his camera eye, and then, after drilling through a bystander’s skull with his camera eye, asks the main character if she is ready for her close-up.\n\nYeah…\n\nHellraiser IV: Bloodline\n\nThe last Hellraiser movie to be released theatrically. This movie goes back in time and treats us to three different stories, one set in the distant past, one in the present, and one in the distant future. All three follow someone of the LeMarchand bloodline, as Phillip LeMarchand was the toymaker who originally made the Lament Configuration in the late 18th century. I’ll say this about Bloodline: it’s the last Hellraiser movie worth giving a damn about. The effects are decent, Pinhead’s got a ton of screen-time, and the lead actor ain’t too bad. Plus, the movie is back to being serious like the first two, even if it does take Pinhead to outer space. At the end of the movie, Dr. Paul Merchant successfully kills Pinhead. They killed him off for good, just like they did with Jason Voorhees after the fourth Friday the 13th.\n\nIt’s a good thing Pinhead is killed 131 years in the future. That way Dimension can run the franchise into the ground and not run into any continuity issues. Onward!\n\nHellraiser V: Inferno\n\nSo we’re in direct-to-video territory now. Okay, well that ain’t bad. These movies don’t need to have the ambition of Hellbound or Bloodlines. Maybe a return-to-roots? …Or they could take a script that wasn’t Hellraiser-related to begin with and jam in Pinhead and Cenobites. Admittedly, it’s better than anything else that followed, but this is still a bad movie. Some of the moments in it are effectively creepy, and the movie has an air of dread. A few cool gory moments. Uh…that’s about it. I don’t really have too much to say. Inferno is very forgettable. Except for laughing wheelchair man. Can’t forget him.\n\nHellraiser IX: Revelations\n\nFor fans of the franchise, you might be surprised to see that this movie is so high on this list. Yes, Stephan Smith Collins is atrocious as Pinhead. Yes, the production quality is absolute shite. Yes, it has a generic subtitle like “Revelations” (revelations about what will be forever a mystery…). And yes, the movie exists only because Dimension wanted to maintain ownership of the franchise and were so cheap that they couldn’t even get back Doug Bradley.\n\nBut.\n\nAnd I can’t believe I’m saying this, but it is reminiscent of the original. You’ve got Nico killing prostitutes for blood after he escaped the Cenobite realm. He even goes so far as to wear his friend’s skin and holds his and Steven’s family hostage, intent on giving someone else to the Cenobites in his place. That’s a Hellraiser kind of script there. Maybe it’s the fatigue from the previous four sequels that helps me ignore that it is more or less copying Hellraiser in several spots, but I don’t mind, honestly.\n\nDon’t get me wrong, though. This movie’s terrible. Bad acting, bad production, bad script…the whole lot. It just happens to be marginally better than three other Hellraiser movies.\n\nHellraiser VIII: Hellworld\n\nIt’s been three sequels since we’ve had an original script, but at last we’ve stopped that miserable trend! Well…kind of. Hellworld is based on a short story called “Dark Can’t Breathe”, so Pinhead still feels like he’s inserted into a completely different horror movie than he should be. The movie attempts to be meta by having the plot revolve around a Hellraiser party. A bunch of 20-somethings go to this mansion owned by Lance Henriksen. Our four main characters aren’t very active. There’s no real objective for them other than to hang around and wait to die.\n\nUnlike the other sequels, this one can be enjoyed in a so-bad-it’s-good kind of way, so this would be the one I’d recommend if you’re wary about treading into the Hellraiser direct-to-video territory.\n\nHenry Cavill, the Man of Steel himself, stars in the movie. That’s neither for nor against the movie. I just felt like I should mention that.\n\nHellraiser VI: Hellseeker\n\nTruth be told, I don’t remember anything about this movie. Okay, so Kirsty’s back and makes yet another deal with the Cenobites to save herself, the lead is Mayhem from those Allstate commercials, and it’s got another “clever” twist, but literally nothing else stuck with me. It’s sort of like Inferno, but worse. Would you be surprised if I told you this sequel was also based on a pre-existing script Dimension had? Yeah…it’s like they wanted to sink this franchise or something. Just watch Inferno and skip this one. Or…ah, hell, I can’t recommend Inferno. Don’t watch these movies, you’ll be better off for it.\n\nHellrasier VII: Deader\n\nUh-uh. I give up. I don’t think it gets much worse than this. And wouldn’t you know it, the script wasn’t intended to be a Hellraiser project in the first place. Because that’s worked so well for Inferno and Hellseeker. As you’d expect, Pinhead feels largely out of place, crammed into dumb dream sequences that are prime with fake-out scares. Doug Bradley is still light years beyond Stephan Smith Collins, but that’s not nearly enough to make this movie worthwhile. The movie looks plain ugly, there’s no two ways about it. The subways are grimy, the protagonist’s apartment is perpetually dark, and there’s no visual variety to ease your suffering in this dull, dull movie. What a stupid subtitle too. Deader. I didn’t think it’d be possible to top Revelations, but they found a way.\n\nIf this movie has anything going for it, it’s that the cult idea could work. The idea is there, but it’s buried underneath so much uninteresting meandering that the whole thing ends up feeling like a big waste.\n\nI don’t like the Rob Zombie Halloween movies much at all, but AT LEAST they knew the source material. Deader is so far off the mark. I hate it. This may be my least favorite horror movie ever. Yes, it is seriously that bad."
