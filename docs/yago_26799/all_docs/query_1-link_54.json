        "text": "Clive Barker’s Night Breed (1990) #1-25\n\nby too many people to even try to summarise\n\nOK, this one nearly broke me. It’s not that these comics are, on the whole, that much worse than most comics: It’s that there’s no direction, no point, no charm, no character to these comics. It took me four days to get through these 25 issues just because I would find constantly find doing something, anything else than reading these more interesting.\n\nSo whatever I have to say about these issues will be even less er insightful than normal, because in the passing of time, I’ve probably forgotten everything I was going to say.\n\nLet’s do a quick recap: In 1990, Clive Barker was hot shit. He’d made two low budget movies that had made a boatload of money; his Books of Blood were genuinely new and fresh takes on the moribund horror genre; and adapting his work was keeping Eclipse Comics alive, and making new series made on his work was highly successful for Epic.\n\nThen 20th Century Fox gave him a larger budget (but not a large budget) to make a proper movie, and that was the end of his golden period: It bombed at the box office, and no critics liked it, either. He was given another opportunity five years later with Lord of Illusion, with much the same result. He’s never made a movie since.\n\nBut when this series was started, everything was hunky dory in Barker-land, and we start off with four issues that adapt the movie itself. Both Alan Grant and John Wagner (the writers) are solid, and I like Jim Baikie’s artwork.\n\nBut… Baikie on a Clive Barker horror adaptation? Baikie draws lanky, attractive, slightly stiff figures… which means that he’s not somebody I would have thought anybody thinking of when talking about Barker.\n\nBut I mean… It does kinda work? It’s more thriller-ey than horrifying.\n\nHe has a very limited repertoire of faces, which makes some things slightly confusing, but his other qualities make up for it. It’s a pretty good adaptation, and if I recall the plot of the movie, they basically cover it all without feeling rushed.\n\nSo topical!\n\nThe problem is, of course, that the movie sucks, and there’s not that much this comic book version can do about that. It’s about hillbillies fighting declassé monsters, and there’s no charm, no interest, no humour, no nothing.\n\nLook at all this character motivation. Look at it!\n\nNightbreed, like most Epic comics, is well-printed, but there’s occasional fuck-ups like this.\n\nOh the morality.\n\nBut, OK, the adaptation is a fine start to the series. It moves along briskly, and it’s pretty exciting, even if it’s hard to care all that much.\n\nBut then we come to the bits that spin out of the series, and we get a revolving cast of writers and artists. Well, Chichester is the writer for the first dozen issues, but the artists seldom last for more than an issue. Which is just plain strange for a somewhat high-profile gig like this.\n\nBut what’s the series going to be about? In the movie, the monsters’ home was blown up, so there’s a diaspora, and Boone is going to find them a new holy land; and meanwhile there’s these monsters that are… worse than the other monsters? So we get fighting between the groups? All the while everybody’s killing the humans?\n\nYou can just read the page above. I think that explains the concept.\n\nIn issue six, they stop calling it an adaptation of the script.\n\nAnd, oh boy. Is it ever not adapted from the screenplay.\n\nIt’s more like Gremlins 2? The monsters are now happy-go-lucky assholes who go around terrorising people. Even over the phone.\n\nIf there’s anything further from the feel of Nightbreed, the movie, it’s this. Which might perhaps be a good thing, since the movie isn’t any good, but this is … awful.\n\nDoes it? Does it really!?\n\n…\n\nWhat’s even more annoying than the unfunny jokes and the plots that make no difference is the artist merry-go-round. Characters look wildly different from issue to issue, and much of the artwork looks rushed and ugly. Mark Nelson above.\n\n“The fact of the matter is”… Have you ever noticed than when people lie, they have a tendency to say “actually” or “in fact”. So, yeah, sure, when the book was “conceptualized” they did mean for it to have a different artist every issue. Sure.\n\nBut this does mean that we sometimes do get some very nice artwork indeed, like this issue from Mark Texeira. The pages toward the end of the issue does look rather rushed, though.\n\nAnd this is kinda fun, I guess? Dan Lawlis and John Rheume, possibly. It’s really, really bad action comics, though, but you can basically make out what’s happening. (And, yes, that woman with the tongue somehow dies from having it shortened a bit.)\n\nThey don’t just change artists between issues, but in the space of one issue, too.\n\nSo I have no idea who this is by.\n\nThis has a certain something, I think?\n\nPackaged with Dirt Magazine!? Aimed at young men…\n\nAfter Chichester leaves, the storyline (as it was, and it wasn’t a lot) totally disintegrates, and we get some issues of random monsters and then some more plot, and then it turns out that all the plot had happened in a crossover with Hellraiser called Jihad. A very Marvel move: Making the big plot points happen somewhere else.\n\nAnyway, this means that you can bring in writers like Larry Wachowski for an issue, and it’s the most disgusting issue in the series. In a good way.\n\nThe letters are mostly positive, but we’re promised that Barker does supervise the storylines.\n\nTony Harris’ artwork certainly has some stark qualities, but doing fight scenes is not one of them.\n\nColleen Doran is roped in to do the pencils on two issues, and as much as I like Doran, this is pretty er ropey work. Perhaps it’s the inker, but this is probably the worst stuff Doran has ever done.\n\nNo touchy the Baphomet! Oh, right, spoilers: This scene is the climactic resolution to an epic storyline of etc etc. Yeah, it’s boring.\n\nI like what Max Douglas is doing here, what with the spattering and the lines and stuff.\n\nBut this shifting-focus thing is less sucessful.\n\nThen we’re at the home stretch! Two issues to go, and … we spend the last-to-final issue getting a recap of everything that’s happened before?!\n\nAnd then the final issue starts with several pages of newspaper cuttings!? (Oh, and we’re told that the circulation of the book is about 20K.)\n\nI think this panel sums up the final issue: We do get a resolution to the entire er plot, as it is, but it happens so quickly as to feel like a *thud*.\n\nAnd then we find out the reason why: The wrap-up was supposed to be five issues, but everything had to be squeezed into a single issue, because the book had been cancelled.\n\nLarry Stark writes in Amazing Heroes #178, page 93\n\nNightbreed opened in a moviehouse\n\nhalf the distance to my local comics\n\nshop two days before the first issue of\n\nthe comic arrived on the shelves.\n\nSince the title had already been de-\n\nlayed for months, I was to see\n\nthe flick before reading the book since\n\nI had seen two newspaper reviews—\n\none that loved, one that hated it. But\n\nI’m not spending six or seven bucks\n\nto review a comic! Besides, it stands\n\non its own or it doesn’t, right?\n\nWell, in this case it doesn’t. After\n\nreading through the first issue, I\n\nremembered some things from those\n\nreviews that made more sense of the\n\ncomic than anyone uould have had\n\nfrom the pages themselves. In other\n\nwords, if I’d seen the movie, I would\n\nhave understood the comic. Since I\n\nhadn’t, everything came very quickly\n\nand sketchily. Things happen in this\n\ncomic so swiftly and with so little\n\npreparation that, apparently, the\n\ncreators expect that anyone paying\n\n$1.95 are only hoping to be reminded\n\nof the flick they’ve already seen.\n\nAnd if you have, why bother?\n\n[…]\n\nJim Baikie’s “art” .is garishly col-\n\nored on slick paper, but it has the look\n\nof illustrated film in every frame, and\n\nnot always well-chosen frames at that.\n\nAt least there are backgrounds in most\n\npanels, and I suppose IEople who have\n\nseen the flick will be reminded of\n\nscenes which must have much more\n\npunch on screen than they have here.\n\nSome (or all?) of these comics have been reprinted in a hardcover series called Clive Barker’s Nightbreed Archive. I couldn’t find any reviews of them."
