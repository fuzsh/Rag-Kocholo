        "text": "Clive Barker should be a household name to anyone even remotely familiar with the horror genre. For the longest time, he was the only storyteller to ever manage to rival Stephen King as the so-called “master of horror”, though they’re both good friends in real life. He’s also one of my favorite authors, consistently producing hauntingly creative tales that both frighten and entertain.\n\nAlthough he rose to fame with the release of his short story collection “Books of Blood” (which is also the wonderful source of most of these adaptations), Barker has helped shape the face of horror with his terrifying work in film, television, painting and even videogames! So, with all this talk about cinematic universes, why not take a look back at some of the horror genre’s best (loosely) interconnected stories?\n\nThat’s why I’ve decided to rank all of the cinematic adaptations of Barker’s writing! I actually enjoy every single one of these movies, but it’s quite clear that some are vastly superior to others. Hell, some of them are even directed by the infamous author himself, and he fares better than King in his attempts at mastering celluloid.\n\nThat being said, I’ll be excluding films he wrote specifically for the big screen, and mainstream television adaptations as well. Now, let’s get to it!\n\n10. Rawhead Rex\n\nWhile I still have lots of fun with this trashy monster movie, it’s quite clear that this is the worst of all the Clive Barker adaptations. Barker’s original story was a somber tale of an ancient phallic-looking evil being unearthed and giving the contemporary British countryside a taste of Old-Testament wrath.\n\nGeorge Pavlou managed to turn that story into a schlocky gore-fest of a film, complete with a heavy-metal-inspired demeanor for the titular creature. While it’s an entertaining romp on its own, it’s obvious that Rawhead Rex completely misses the point of its originally disturbing story.\n\n9. Book of Blood\n\nInspired by the two-parter tale that frames Barker’s original collection of short stories, John Harrison’s Book of Blood isn’t necessarily a bad movie, it’s just not the most entertaining one on this list.\n\nWhile it maintains the somber tone and overall plot of the story it’s based on, the movie is bogged down by uninteresting characters and an uneven structure. When the story does pick up, however, be prepared for some amazingly gruesome sequences that will remind you why Barker’s work is so successful.\n\n8. Quicksilver Highway (The Body Politic)\n\nNot a lot of people remember this darkly funny Mick Garris film featuring two incredibly memorable stories from both Stephen King and Clive Barker (not to mention Christopher Lloyd having loads of fun in one of his most entertaining roles to date).\n\nQucksilver Highway is more of a dark comedy than a straight-up horror film, but it does showcase some of Barker’s fantastical creativity in the segment concerning a man whose own hands turn against him. To say more would spoil the fun.\n\n7. Dread\n\nIt may not be in the upper ranks of this list, but Anthony DiBlasi’s Dread might very well be my favorite of these adaptations. Based on one of Barker’s most down-to-earth tales, this film is a disturbing psychological thriller that plays with audience expectations.\n\nAlthough Dread is weighed down by a few moments of low production value and some questionable changes to the source material, it’s undeniably one of the scariest and most brutal films on this list.\n\n6. Lord of Illusions (Director’s Cut)\n\nMany moviegoers consider Lord of Illusions to be a love it or hate it sort of affair, and while I fall into the former category, I entirely understand why some might not enjoy this peculiar little film like I do (though watching the director’s cut certainly improves the experience).\n\nDirected by Clive Barker himself, this film is the only time we’ve seen the signature protagonist of the “Barker mythos”, Harry D’amour, on the big screen, and it’s a blast! Featuring eldritch conspiracies and noir undertones, you really shouldn’t miss out on this supernatural detective story.\n\n5. Hellbound: Hellraiser II\n\nWhile it was directed by Tony Randel instead of Barker, Hellbound: Hellraiser 2 was the last film in the franchise to feature major involvement from the mastermind behind the cenobites and the cursed puzzle box, and it shows.\n\nThe insane plot, a detailed attempt at world-building and disturbing sexual undertones easily make this the best of the Hellraiser sequels so far, and a great film in its own right.\n\n4. The Midnight Meat Train\n\nThe brainchild of a partnership between Japanese director Ryuhei Kitamura and Barker, The Midnight Meat Train is one of the strangest (and best) slasher movies ever made.\n\nStarring a (mostly) pre-fame Bradley Cooper, this gory yet surprisingly suspenseful thriller chronicles a photographer’s descent into madness as he pursues a horrific subway-based serial killer. The less you know about this one going in the better, so all I’ll say is that it’s a must watch for fans of the genre.\n\n3. Nightbreed (Director’s Cut)\n\nAlthough we’ve only recently been able to watch Barker’s original vision of this peculiar movie, the wait was definitely worth it! Another one of Barker’s adaptations of his own work, this is also one of the best.\n\nFeaturing an epic tale of men and monsters (not to mention legendary director David Cronenberg acting as one of the creepiest killers ever put to film), Nightbreed is one of those rare movies that dares to be its own thing, defying genre and audience expectations with its nightmarishly beautiful effects and bizarre yet compelling plot.\n\n2. Hellraiser\n\nThere isn’t much more to be said about this genuine horror classic. Directed by Barker, adapted from his novella The Hellbound Heart, this film cemented the writer as a legend in the world of horror movies, spawning a long-running franchise featuring one of the most memorable horror antagonists of all time.\n\nWhile some of the effects haven’t aged very well, and the film does drag a bit in the second act, Hellraiser is without a doubt Clive’s best cinematic work to date and an essential part of horror movie history.\n\n1. Candyman\n\nMore than a few people will disagree with this choice, but I maintain that no other film has captured the ethereal beauty and intense terror of a Clive Barker story like Bernard Rose’s Candyman.\n\nBased on The Forbidden, another Books of Blood story, Candyman is a dreamlike look at the effects that myths can have on real life, and what happens when the boundaries between legend and reality are shattered. Featuring an amazing performance from Tony Todd as the titular Candyman, a terrifying yet subtle script, memorable visuals and a haunting score by Phillip Glass, this horror movie, along with Barker, will go down in legend like Candyman himself.\n\nI think part of our collective fascination with serial killers comes from an empathetic desire to uncover exactly what needs to go wrong for a human being to snap and turn into a murderer. That’s why it makes sense that this form of morbid curiosity lies at the heart of so many successful horror stories, with countless genre filmmakers trying their best to explore the minds of predators.\n\nAnd in honor of M. Night Shyamalan’s latest thriller expertly allowing us to see through the eyes of a cold-blooded murderer, we’ve decided to come up with a list highlighting six other serial killer movies told from the killer’s perspective. After all, there are plenty of interesting cinematic killers out there, and not all of them are as charming as Josh Hartnett in Trap.\n\nAs usual, don’t forget to comment below with your own murderous favorites if you think we missed a particularly thrilling one. And while we won’t be including it on the list, I’d also like to give a shout-out to Chris Nash’s avant-garde slasher In a Violent Nature, which follows a Jason-Voorhees-inspired murderer as he embarks on a vengeful rampage.\n\nWith that out of the way, onto the list…\n\n6. Mr. Brooks (2007)\n\nI can’t be the only one who wishes Kevin Costner did more horror movies. While Bruce A. Evans’ deep dive into the mind of a fractured man is more of a psychological thriller than a proper scary movie, it’s still proof that Costner can be legitimately terrifying when he chooses to be.\n\nTelling the story of a seemingly normal man who secretly struggles to keep his murderous alter ego under control, Mr. Brooks doesn’t exactly re-invent the serial killer wheel with its ruminations on addiction, but you can’t help but sympathize with Costner as his double life spirals out of control.\n\nAnd if you like this one, don’t forget to check out our interview with the director as he explores the film’s unmade sequels!\n\n5. Maniac (1980)\n\nIt’s rare that both a horror film and its remake are equally good explorations of their respective subject matter, but since we already included Franck Khalfoun’s Maniac on our list recommending six experimental slashers, today I’d like to highlight the grimy thrills of William Lustig’s 1980 original. It may not feature the same POV gimmick as its 2012 successor, but Maniac still does a phenomenal job of putting viewers in the shoes of a deeply disturbed individual.\n\nFollowing a murderous landlord as he slays (and scalps) his way through New York City, this brutal character study is only enhanced by its low production value and seedy Manhattan backdrop. Lustig makes the most of eerie street corners and dark alleyways here, making this film a memorable portrait of urban chaos – as well as one hell of a disturbing gore-fest.\n\n4. The House that Jack Built (2018)\n\nEven Lars von Trier’s more conventional films tend to tackle controversial subject matter, but The House that Jack Built takes the director’s penchant for dark stories to the next level with its portrayal of a deeply malevolent man that embodies all the worst traits of famous serial killers. Feeling a lot like an art-house companion piece to American Psycho, this mean-spirited romp is so gruesome that you often forget it’s meant to be satirical.\n\nFrom animal cruelty to the disturbingly realistic slaughter of innocent women, this is one of the most uncomfortable movies on this list, but it also features a mesmerizing performance by the incredibly talented Matt Dillon. That alone already makes it worth the price of admission. I wouldn’t recommend this one to duck lovers, though.\n\n3. Peeping Tom (1960)\n\nMoral panics are nothing new, especially when it comes to media depicting grisly acts of murder. And while some desensitized viewers might not understand why this 1960 thriller nearly ruined its director’s career, I think Peeping Tom still holds up as one of the UK’s earliest example of schlocky exploitation.\n\nA surprisingly meta story about the thrills of watching others die on celluloid, Peeping Tom introduces us to an aspiring filmmaker who secretly murders women and produces snuff films about their dying moments – a decidedly modern premise for a movie produced decades before the slasher craze.\n\n2. Man Bites Dog (1992)\n\nOne of the most shocking examples of Found Footage/mockumentary filmmaking that doesn’t involve the paranormal, this pioneer Belgian flick is way more influential than most genre fans give it credit for. Inspiring everything from Behind the Mask: The Rise of Leslie Vernon to What We Do in the Shadows, Man Bites Dog is another case of storytellers using serial killing as an excuse to explore our fascination with violent media.\n\nAnd while the film is presented as a serious documentary about a charming murderer who slowly recruits the filmmakers to his cause, it’s the satirical undertones that make it so effective. That being said, you’ll likely forget the humorous elements when Ben commits some of the most heinous acts ever put on film.\n\n1. Henry: Portrait of a Serial Killer (1986)\n\nHenry: Portrait of a Serial Killer is loosely inspired by claims made by real life murderer Henry Lee Lucas (as well as his partner in crime Otis Toole), and while most of the supposed 600 deaths once attributed to Henry have since been proven to be false confessions, John McNaughton’s low budget character study escapes its sensationalist True Crime origins due to its honest and unflinching portrayal of antisocial behavior.\n\nFrom the gritty 16mm photography to the frighteningly realistic death scenes, there’s plenty to love about this controversial indie flick. However, the film’s greatest asset is a young Michael Rooker in a career-making role as our disturbed main character.\n\nJust make sure you don’t choose this one for family movie night."
