        "text": "Spaceships, video games, kung fu cowboys – we have such sights to show you!\n\nAn auspicious start to a new feature, but one I’ve nonetheless been thinking about since starting this blog. I love the idea of movie series that go on for too long, whose later installments seem compelled to introduce bizarreties and strangeness despite that their shrinking budgets can’t contain them. Problem is, I’ve never seen one of these long series in their entirety. Off the top of my head, they’re all horror, like Friday the 13th, A Nightmare on Elm Street, Halloween, and Home Alone. This is the space where I want to talk about Jaws: The Revenge or when the slasher goes to space and Rocky wins the Cold War.\n\nThe trouble with Hellraiser in this regard is that it was bizarre from the start. And, as we may discover, ill-defined. The story of Frank and Julia didn’t have “ten-part film franchise” written all over it, and yet here we are. Of course, it’s Pinhead and the Cenobites that would define Hellraiser, becoming horror icons wholly cleaved from the diminishing returns of the sequels.\n\nSo where do we begin? By my reckoning, it’s Hellraiser: Bloodline, the fourth installment. My layman’s understanding is that Hellraiser is the good one and people argue for the sequel, Hellbound: Hellraiser II, because of Clive Barker’s involvement. Hellraiser III: Hell on Earth saw Barker’s first absence from the franchise, and perhaps a dip in quality (see: CD-shooting Cenobite). According to one of the series’ key creatives, Peter Atkins, fans have also begun to rehabilitate the image of Hellraiser III, which he describes in an interview with Bloody Disgusting as “really touching.”\n\nFor all of us. I always talk about this with Doug, the fact that people are remotely fond of shit we did thirty years ago. It’s very heartwarming and comforting to us as we reach our golden years, you know.\n\nIn Barker’s absence, we unfortunately introduce the Weinsteins, and in fact, Hellraiser III is the first release of Dimension Films – the house that Robert Rodriguez built, eventually. Hollywood rule of thumb indicates that no one has a good Weinstein story, and the Hellraiser braintrust was no exception. When Barker returned, he and Atkins worked on a story that would be the grand finale, beginning with the origin of the Lament Configuration and ending in space! Yes, putting Pinhead in space was actually Clive Barker’s idea. They pitched it to Bob Weinstein and he okayed it, they shot it, cut it, and held a test screening. You probably know what happens next.\n\nThe reason Hellraiser: Bloodline is the beginning of our story is not because it’s Hellraiser in Space (before Event Horizon) but because it’s a notoriously compromised film. And the feature debut of Adam Scott.\n\nHellraiser: Bloodline (1996)\n\nLike William Gibson’s Alien 3 or Harlan Ellison’s I, Robot, the “original” Hellraiser: Bloodline has been the subject of fan desire for decades, though no true director’s cut exists. As it stands, the film is one of the last to be credited to Alan Smithee. In truth directed by Kevin Yagher with reshoots by Joe Chappelle, the final product is no less coherent than previous entries, but reading up on the original plan is frustrating, especially as the existing film can’t be reworked to fulfill it; Miramax went crazy slashing script pages from the shooting schedule. According to Atkins, the really good stuff never went before the camera.\n\nBloodline had long been on my radar for the prominence of a female Cenobite – maybe the series’ most prominent until this year: Angelique. Little did I know, she’s not exactly a Cenobite, and at first appears to occupy the Julia role, seducing men into dark places and killing them with the Lament Configuration — opening the box, I mean, though some people will be bludgeoned with the cube later. She’s hounding after “the toymaker,” John Merchant, in fact chasing him for hundreds of years after being summoned to Earth by a sadistic count. But somehow, Pinhead returns, and this is where it feels like Hellraiser has been tacked onto something else – only not, in this case. It’s also around this time I begin to reflect on the rules of Hellraiser, and how everything works. Sometimes you can use the box to seal away the Cenobites, sometimes it kills people. What is Pinhead doing? What does he want, at any given time?\n\nWhile Hellraiser III shapes an actual arc with the character off of where we left him in Hellraiser II, I’ve got no idea this time. It seems like the stakes have never been higher – fitting for a finale – where Pinhead wants to stop John Merchant from creating an anti-Lament Configuration and permanently seal the Cenobites away. However, Pinhead is never in a hurry. He even uses dirty tricks, threatening John’s wife and kid. Apparently, he’s fed up with Angelique’s seduction method for inducing human behavior and decides to make a thing of it. In the original version, this conflict was far more significant. From Wikipedia:\n\nAngelique represented an older, more chaotic version of Hell that favors drawn-out temptation, and Pinhead represented an ascetic, results-based order that takes over.\n\nMy God, I love Hell bureaucracy. I picked up The Scarlet Gospels for just that reason, but didn’t get far enough before I had to move and throw all my books away in the always-full book bins intermittently dotting Los Angeles. Fuck, was that a frustrating few weeks. Instead, this clash of cultures between old and new hell priests is Pinhead’s sudden impatience with an ill-defined rival.\n\nIt is so much more than your typical “slasher goes to space” sequel, but at the same time so much less than Jason X. It isn’t as free to be itself, whether goofy or deadly Clive Barker serious. All the ingredients for the great final installment were here, if only they were developed – or rather, uncompromised. We have Pinhead’s multigenerational conflict with the Lemarchand bloodline, his tension with Angelique, and even a Cenobite dog. Maybe we needed the CD launcher after all.\n\nHellraiser: Inferno (2000)\n\nTempted as I am to begin with a forceful spout of profanity, I cannot. I need to save myself. Hellraiser: Bloodline was the last theatrical release from this series, and will be for a while, given that 2022’s reboot is a streaming exclusive. Of course, the direct-to-video market was a lot different back then. These days, the best movies and TV shows unfold in unresponsive menus at the earliest convenience, and then there’s the theatrical “mainstream” for Top Gun and, lastly, the barrel-bottom mockbusters which have supplanted movies like Hellraiser: Inferno on the ghosts of Blockbuster Video shelves. I wonder if you’ll find a Raiseheller at your local Redbox next month.\n\nThis is where the Weinsteins muscle Clive Barker out of the franchise. Instead of tapping that particular wellspring of weird (and uneven) ideas, they turned to Paul Harris Boardman and Scott Derrickson. Now, you may recognize that second name, as he’s got horror credentials of his own. More old-school than the arthouse “elevated” crowd (Ari Aster, Jordan Peele), Derrickson landed a hit with Sinister which opened the way for the first Doctor Strange. But he got his start with far lower-budgeted affairs, Hellraiser V among them.\n\nPerhaps for Derrickson’s involvement, Inferno has a decent reputation – relative to the series – with a 17% Rotten Tomatoes score at the time of this writing. The chief criticism is that it doesn’t feel like a Hellraiser movie, almost as if Hellraiser has been tacked onto something else – oh, but we’re still not there. We follow a day in the life of Detective Joseph Thorne – played with Batman intensity by Craig Sheffer, of Nightbreed – our first protagonist entirely removed from the Cotton family or the Lemarchand bloodline. And he’s a dick. That’s just about all you need to know. Strange visions plague Thorne as he tracks a serial killer nicknamed the Engineer. I swear, the word “engineer” is spoken more times than the word “fuck” in any movie set in Boston.\n\nThere’s one effective sequence, which is Thorne’s first encounter with the Cenobites, revealed in a disconcerting manner. These are the so-called Wire Twins, who start rubbing up on Thorne and putting their hands inside his flesh. Typical sort of sex stuff, as I understand it. The film has an overall unnerving atmosphere and a flashy, precisely shot and edited opening scene, albeit one with a misleading character introduction. Our first impression of Thorne is that he’s some kind of genius detective, but the single modifier is actually “corrupt,” and this is definitely early 2000s “corrupt.” He has sex with a sex worker and pockets a few hundred dollars out of a murdered man’s wallet. Please.\n\nThis is the one where a guy gets beaten up by two Japanese men in cowboy outfits, and that’s funny enough. But for the most part, Hellraiser: Inferno is simply unpleasant. You have this mean-spirited cop, an elderly couple stuck in a nursing home, a little girl pining for her deadbeat dad, the suggestion of the torture of a child, a pedophilie ice cream man – nothing I really want to see or think about in a movie, never mind one promising the specific thrills of Hellraiser. I was already worn out when I decided to check the runtime, assuming it was nearly through – 20 minutes left. Oh, what beautiful suffering!\n\nThe problem with the film’s stumbling, meandering climax, whose inherent comedy (Thorne shooting all the people he’s met with a shotgun, one by one) is severely undercut by sheer boredom, because I don’t give a shit about this dude. My most recent viewing of Jacob’s Ladder may have bumped it out of a personal top 20 [movies of all time], but for all its awkwardness, there’s a strong anchor in Jacob Singer. I’m a soft sell for the downtrodden hero, and Singer is brother to Johnny Smith in The Dead Zone – one of my all-time favorite film performances. Thorne would rather shotgun his way through this Jacob’s Ladder/Silent Hill episode, and while Inferno does peel back another lore layer in demonstrating the experience of damnation, I don’t also want to feel damned.\n\nHellraiser: Hellseeker (2002)\n\nWhat a title! It’s like someone tripped over a word and instantly corrected themselves. “Hellraiser? No, Hellseeker.” I’d say it’s a problem that “hell” is in the subtitle, but that’s been going on since Hellbound. It’s actually rare for “hell” to not be in the subtitle of a Hellraiser movie.\n\nI had a few expectations going into this post. One was a matter of my own reaction, a suspicion; I wanted to know if the common wisdom that Hellraiser movies are terrible is a commentary on the acting, or any sort of instantly-readable flaw characteristic of direct-to-video. Another is that each Hellraiser movie gets worse as they go along, and I’m already finding this debatable.\n\nInferno and Hellseeker are directly comparable, with almost the same story and “twist.” We have a guy experiencing violent hallucinations and then it turns out he’s been damned all along! Cue Pinhead. While Inferno is much better versed in horror language, with atmosphere and jump scares, Hellseeker benefits from featuring a protagonist who isn’t so purposely loathsome. We have the return of Kirsty Cotton, the ostensible franchise lead but already a thing of the past by Bloodline. But here’s a twist: she isn’t the main character.\n\nIn fact, she’s seemingly killed in the opening scene, when she gets a little too frisky with her husband, who’s driving a car – and into the river they go! The husband should be used to this sort of thing, being played by Dean Winters of those Allstate “Mayhem” commercials, and he’s our protagonist. Finding himself under police suspicion for Kirsty’s disappearance (despite that he watched her drown) and stumbling through a series of strange sexual encounters that turn murderous, Dean – or Trevor – may not be corrupt, but he is a very reactive character.\n\nWhen the inevitable divine judgment comes, we realize we don’t know anything about this guy — this amnesiac. What strikes me about Hellseeker in this regard is how the conversations between characters are so insubstantial. Whether it’s the one good cop chasing him down or the parade of horny women coming onto him always, there’s barely even eye contact. It might boil down to: “Are you okay?” “Yeah, I’m fine,” in the hallway of the police station. Maybe we call it the Jacob’s Ladder curse, that every character is left blank and “mysterious” so that we think, “Hmm, what’s this guy’s deal?” Sure, it makes for a later reveal, but it isn’t interesting in the moment.\n\nThis is the first time I’m feeling the budget, too. Indeed, the acting is listless and likely a product of insufficient direction and thin material, but we’re also bouncing between a very small handful of locations in search of rhythm. Apartment, police station, bus, spa, apartment, police station, bus, underground laboratory. In addition to the weary dread of “Oh, here he goes, walking into the next scene, I wonder where – apartment?! Surely you jest!” it places an inordinate burden on the most recurring of these sets, the police station.\n\nClawing for any sort of thematic purpose, I suppose an equation is made between the tortures of hell and those of the judicial system. There’s more bondage in any episode of NCIS than all of Hellraiser, but I’d be hard-pressed to say that Hellseeker is making anything of that fact or the potential post-9/11 significance of the constant surveillance cameras.\n\nSomewhere in my Hellraiser studies I came upon the notion that the films may get bad but they’re always interesting. I think I’ve found the exception. In defiance of this very post, Hellseeker is simply not weird. It’s just bland and deficient, with a horrible score and forgettable imagery. I say that because I can’t recall any, though I did watch it back-to-back with our next entry, so there’s some blurring.\n\nHellraiser: Deader (2005)\n\nHellseeker begins the Rick Bota trilogy, continuing through Deader and ending in Hellworld. What connects them is the curious note that none of their screenplays were originally Hellraiser-related. This is where that part of the story comes in. Hellseeker began life as a spec script and was extensively rewritten, to the surprise of the original writer. Deader was initially a script just called Deader, and similarly had Hellraiser grafted onto it. According to Bloody Disgusting by way of Wikipedia, “it entailed a newspaper reporter being sent to Romania to cover an underground cult who have discovered the secret of immortality and had gained contact with an otherworldly dimension.”\n\nThis actually enticed me, and aside from Judgment, I think Deader was the sequel I was looking forward to the most, or dreading the least. I’ve always found cults fascinating for their psychological implications, and in a horror context, we may see human sacrifice or ritualistic murder on an island in the middle of nowhere. There’s something truly exotic about cults, and it’s intriguing. We all liked Midsommar, right? Eh.\n\nI will say that Midsommar was genuinely creepy, but it represents such a different approach to filmmaking. It sprung fully formed from an auteur with a post-breakout budget. As we know, Deader was Frankensteined together on the page and, naturally, shot simultaneously with the follow-up Hellworld in Eastern Europe. I am certain Eastern Europe will have its day in film, but for now, it’s historically been shorthand for “tax incentive,” and tends to attract low-budget productions like this.\n\nIn Deader, journalist Amy Klein investigates an underground cult, and we already have more character motivation than we enjoyed in Hellseeker. She isn’t just making faces at scary things, she’s actively searching something out – but in practice, she’s making faces at scary things – and screaming. My God, is Amy is a screamer. It’s odd, because she puts on a strong face, but the moment there’s danger, here comes the wailing. The actress Kari Wuhrer played a much tougher character in Eight Legged Freaks the previous year.\n\nSo what is she freaking out about? Let me tell you. In this movie, scary stuff happens and then she wakes up in bed. Just a dream?! This is why Deader and Hellseeker blur together so much. It really throws into question what Hellraiser is supposed to be. We’ve entered into the Silent Hill phase, with standalone protagonists guided through personal hells by Pinhead, but that’s not what the original Hellraiser was about. It was a love story between two weirdos, and just happened to feature some spectacular set pieces. By the time of Deader, we have low-key scenes like Amy trying to shimmy between two walls and a guy is slashing at her with a knife. Maybe she’s got a knife already stuck in her back and is trying to get it out, screaming all the while. That’s actually a great setup for a comedy-horror scene, but what are we doing here?\n\nThere was a point where I did have to pause the movie to fall asleep, but I also “woke up” when Pinhead exposits that he’s at war with the Deader cult. Yes! That’s what I want: Hell politics. Unfortunately, it plays out with the same economy of scope as Hellseeker, with a final battle taking place not on an island but the set of Beyond Belief starring Jonathan Frakes. I mean, at least they are sets, and there’s a stronger effort made at production design this time. With a motivated protagonist, too, this should be a home run! The thing with Jacob’s Ladder, though, is that narratives took shape in each of the parallel realities. The character evolved. Amy can’t. We know she’s just gonna wake up in bed after whichever spooky encounter – nothing matters.\n\nHellraiser: Hellworld (2005)\n\nEspecially disappointing about the last two entries is their squeaky-clean demeanors. Nothing untoward, nothing icky, as if they aren’t the sixth and seventh installments in a series – or Hellraiser movies! Which, to be fair, they weren’t. And neither was Hellworld, and while this should be the saddest fact about how Hellraiser movies are made, it isn’t. We’re not there yet. As bad as things will get, you know this one’s gonna be bad just by looking at the back of the box: “Gamers playing a MMORPG based on the Hellraiser films find their lives endangered after being invited to a rave, the host of which intends to show them the truth behind the Cenobite mythos.” Thanks, IMDb.\n\nThere’s something very wrong with Hellraiser: Hellworld, but I’m gonna pretend to be outraged about something else first, that the movie actually fails to follow the above-cited premise. If you look at the poster, it’s one of two things: the usual Pinhead-face Hellraiser poster but with a digital twist, or a slightly less goofy version of the poster for Congo.\n\nThe tagline is “Evil goes online,” but then the movie is about kids stumbling around a mansion. Evil is online for, like, one scene. The characters talk about an “Internet game,” but we never see a player avatar Pinhead doing wicked DPS on the creep. It’s a shame, especially for a film featuring renowned nerd Henry Cavill, in his fourth film role. This was before someone clicked on his edge and stretched him wide, though the posh accent remains.\n\nIndeed, in addition to the still declining acting, we’ve added accent battles. While the character Allison is allowed to be British, Cavill is not, and then we have Katheryn Winnick as Chelsea, whose suppression of a Canadian-Ukrainian accent gives unnatural texture to already stilted line deliveries. And I’m sorry, Ms. Winnick. I know she’s another successful actor, but she turns in a real dud here. She doesn’t ratchet the intensity but rather explodes, and it’s a flailing, awkward performance to witness – and I’m again sorry and I should emphasize that. Turns out, Winnick got her start in movies training actors in martial arts, and even gets a couple opportunities to show off that prowess here. Maybe a nice callback to the kung fu cowboys of Inferno.\n\nKatheryn Winnick in Vikings\n\nHellworld gets off to a shocking start. We open on a funeral, where after introducing this CW-looking cast of characters, Chelsea gets up and opens the casket of her friend Adam and he grabs her! She screams and struggles and – you guessed it – wakes up, though this time on a couch two years later. In the three years we’ve been doing this, nobody thought to take Rick aside and say, “Hey, this thing where there’s scary stuff and then the person wakes up and it was all a dream? It’s not working.” Rounding off this cast is the always-welcome Lance Henrikson, who lends a gravitas to those long stretches between Pinhead cameos. It might be because he’s an adult. I didn’t realize how important that was gonna be.\n\nThese teenagers’ very presence invites an attempt at the rat-a-tat dialogue of Joss Whedon and the self-awareness of Kevin Williamson, a more vile combination I cannot bear to imagine. Henrikson, as the increasingly villainous Host, pops up behind Chelsea to say, “Like a bad horror movie, isn’t it?” after she fails to start a car. Chelsea later mockingly refers to Pinhead as a “franchise icon.” This is one of the many things that dates Hellworld, within an otherwise timeless franchise about eternity and unknown dimensions. This is a few years after Scream 3, when I think the horror deconstruction was getting old (and also a few years after Scary Movie 3). Also placing Hellworld squarely in 2005 is its Departed-like fixation on cell phones, talk of an MMO and an emerging Internet generation, and of course, CGI. Even if the kills are interesting in concept, they always look weirdly two-dimensional.\n\nThe only thing missing, then, is the commentary on these screechy teens. There’s a general air of “wrongness” about them from the beginning, insofar as they’re being judged by a judgey dickhead (the other ostensible lead, Jake), but in practice, they’re surprisingly engaged with the Hellworld house and seem to be interested in things. They’re living in the moment, we might say. But surprisingly, there’s no morality play or indictment of human behavior, leaving us only with the novelty of an ensemble. Here I was thinking that the mistake of previous films was their focus on a single character, making for plodding, lonely journeys with precious opportunity for character development. Now we have a handful of plodding, lonely journeys. People walk into rooms and things happen, and then it turns out they didn’t happen. The scary part is when the movie says, “Or maybe they did!”\n\nHowever maligned the term, part of the reason we have “elevated horror” today is surely because of the prior decade. The 2000s was such a wasteland of remakes, torture porn, and direct-to-video sequels. There are elements in Hellworld that could be extrapolated into effective sequences or even entire films these days. Rather than virtual reality like I thought, this movie is more like an escape room, like the 2019 film Escape Room. Then there’s Lance Henrikson’s mysterious host, and we’re not sure if what he’s presenting is a show or if it’s real, perhaps like 2019’s Pilgrim. Here, these exist as elements in a muddled yet somehow empty experience. Think about how clear and coherent movies like Hereditary are, or The Witch, or Get Out. They may not be batshit like these older movies, but maybe that’s the devil’s bargain they struck.\n\nAnd is Hellworld truly batshit? It’s more eventful than Deader, but no less frustrating. There’s a scene where Chelsea calls the police – addressing the reality of modern technology in the context of a horror movie – and despite that she’s banging on the window, the cop looks up and doesn’t see her there. This is where the shifting mythology comes into play. It’s not that it’s unfair, there’s a dull resignation. “Of course she isn’t there. That’s just how it goes, I don’t know.” And this is very important in horror. While vampire and ghost movies have to wrestle with the rules – too few and it’s arbitrary, too many and the mystery is gone – Hellraiser discards the discipline entirely. It’s all arbitrary, and so there are surprises in the technical sense, of screeching music cues and sudden violence, but nothing registers as shock. Here comes Pinhead.\n\nIt seems as if Pinhead’s appearances are decreasing in length and impact with each installment, as if he’s here out of obligation. He comes in and prattles off about desire and whatever. Doug Bradley is always great, but the character definitely needs the right opener. It just seems like these movies are about non-characters being punished for things we didn’t see them do. “Turns out, you were an asshole!” he booms. When most of the self-righteous speechifying is an exposition dump, it’s vindictive and anti-dramatic. However, this is Bradley’s last appearance in the series, and if anything, he’s back to his original self. Pinhead is not the chief antagonist, and the film’s conflict derives from evil born in the human heart. Sorry one final time, if I just made it sound more interesting than it is.\n\nHellraiser: Revelations (2011)\n\nI arrived at the ninth installment of Hellraiser with a mix of relief and dread. I’d been watching these movies back-to-back, day after day, and was finding all too late that the human mind is not properly fortified against such terror. But it felt like I’d come through something, having survived the isolated experience of watching the bad Hellraiser movies preceding Hellraiser: Revelations. This is the one people know about. It should be Hellraiser: Endgame. And yet, you can’t even describe its badness as legendary, because it’s expected. Badness was the product, even the aim. We’ve reached past Z-grade and landed, face-first, in copyright preservation.\n\nKnowing that a Hellraiser remake would be profitable, The Weinstein Company rushed a new sequel into production to fulfill a legal requirement and retain the license, and filmed Revelations in a matter of weeks. While this isn’t a far cry from the circumstances of Hellworld, which was shot alongside Deader as “a contractual stipulation for filming in Romania,” (Thanks, Wikipedia), it does feature “the Weinsteins” more prominently in the narrative. We ought to know that the movie is cheap, cynically produced, and produced by terrible men who were terrible to all our favorite filmmakers and even worse to women.\n\nClive Barker’s only statement about the film is a tweet: “I want to put on record that the flic out there using the word Hellraiser IS NO FUCKIN’ CHILD OF MINE! I have NOTHING to do with the fuckin’ thing. If they claim its from the mind of Clive Barker, it’s a lie. It’s not even from my butt-hole.” Ahead of production, Doug Bradley made a public statement to clear up confusion about his potential role: “One way or another, this does not seem to me to represent a serious attempt to revive the Hellraiser franchise. However, I wish everyone who will be directly involved in the making of this film, good luck with it.”\n\nIt was impossible for me to recalibrate my expectations, as I knew this story before watching the movie. I knew that every flaw would be amplified, every bad decision traced back to Hollywood’s biggest boogeymen. And lo, we open on found footage. This is the one cheapo horror line that Hellraiser had yet to cross, now shaky and fast-cutting in my face. We’re introduced to two insufferable young men, Nico and Steven, talking about driving from Los Angeles to Tijuana for the exclusive purpose of having sex. And the way Nico says “Tijuana” and keeps saying it – nails on a chalkboard.\n\nThankfully, like the false start of Harbinger Down, whose opening sequence had me worried, the whole movie isn’t this. Once in Tijuana, Nico is suddenly on his knees, surrounded by candles, the Lament Configuration in his hands. Pinhead walks into frame and then we cut to a more traditionally-shot and edited scene with different characters watching this footage on a camcorder. And actually, the jump to this new sequence is jarring. For however irritating Nico and Steven are, found footage is pretense for naturalistic acting and, I imagine, ad-libbing. These new characters, their surviving families, are wooden in comparison.\n\nTurns out, Nico and Steven have been dead for some time – under mysterious circumstances – and these two families haven’t really talked about it, despite meeting regularly. This is all too much for Emma, Steven’s sister, who finally breaks the ice. What follows is a strangely dignified drama between these two families, as if the lower budget can’t afford gimmicks or locations and forces the film to focus on one thing: characters. It’s slightly above something you might see on a primetime CBS show, with actors actually acting and towards one another, with emotion and even yelling. Not only that, there’s actual mystery, when Steven suddenly returns despite the testimony of the found footage.\n\nIf you watch all of these Hellraiser movies in a row, you’ll keep seeing three names in the credits: Doug Bradley (as Pinhead), (based on characters by) Clive Barker, and Gary J. Tunnicliffe, who did the make-up effects starting with Hellraiser III. If anyone’s been working their way up the Hellraiser ladder, and perhaps a reason for a Hellraiser ladder to even exist, it’s Tunnicliffe, who directed second-unit on Deader and even appeared as a Cenobite at the end of Hellworld. In an interview with ScifiNow, he characterizes his involvement with the franchise as a “dream job,” saying, “I looked up at the screen, saw Pinhead and [asked]: Who did that and how did they do it? I want to do that.”\n\nIn the years between Hell on Earth and Hellworld – whose very titles suggest how far the franchise had come – the practical effects never wavered. His hand never slipped, as he watched from the sidelines while writers and directors and producers repeatedly screwed everything up. For Revelations, the film that the least amount of executives cared about, Tunnicliffe was given a shot at writing. “Fuck it, just get the makeup guy.” So if anything, Gary J. Tunnicliffe is the Lester Freamon of Dimension Films.\n\nWe’re still missing setup that makes for payoffs, but there is genuine conflict and, most shocking of all, thematic coherence. At around the 30-minute mark, we learn that this is actually a proper sequel to Hellraiser and Hellbound. We’ve taken the central premise of damned souls harvesting other souls to stave off damnation by the Cenobites and transplanted it to a concrete setting where the villains can be truly evil. Nico and Steven are white American tourists wreaking havoc in Mexico, and they rationalize their murders with racist assumptions about the locals. Steven assumes the first woman they meet is a prostitute, and Nico fires off a number of humdingers, like how there’s a hundred killings a day down here or do they even have juries in Mexico?\n\nAnd just like that, the movie is about something. We’re privileged with the first sacrifice victim’s discomfort and eventual resistance to sex via a far more interested camera than ever lensed the teens from Hellworld or the wandering losers from Inferno, Hellseeker, and Deader. Nico, in skinned Frank Cotton mode, induces Steven’s violence by challenging his manhood. At last, whereupon Pinhead assumes his high horse, he’ll actually have a point. There’s an undeniable logic this time to how the mythology works. Desire inevitably leads to the Cenobites, and their interpretation of pleasure and pain is either alien or more extreme than desired. A palindrome, right, Thorne?\n\nThere’s an evil emanating out of the Lament Configuration, with graphic kills at the source and moving outward to a dark influence on the people who merely behold it, which is how we get a brother/sister makeout scene. Bold, I’d say, of the filmmakers to do something truly unsettling. By the time we’ve had our revelations about the true nature of the story, and the film’s antagonist is revealing the dirty truths behind these wealthy families – an instinctive cliché that comes with the territory – I’m kind of marveling at how deliberately produced the film is despite its circumstances. I can’t say it’s a great film overall, with the acting and the missing components of dramatic scenes, but somebody clearly cared – Gary J. Tunnicliffe.\n\nWhat I’m finding is that he’s one of the unsung heroes of Hellraiser. While Clive Barker has constantly run away from it, in turns protective and ashamed of the film series, Tunnicliffe has stayed on and made a real effort with the script for Revelations. This has been the biggest surprise of this installment of Too Many Sequel-itis. I went in with expectations, and maybe the film benefited. Maybe with four really bad movies under my belt, I was a beached man after days lost at sea. Actually, the last four movies I watched were these Hellraiser sequels, where at least I broke up Inferno and Hellseeker with Ridley Scott’s excellent The Last Duel. No such relief this time. Have I simply gone mad? Am I gonna wake up in a second?\n\nHellraiser: Judgment (2018)\n\nIf the lowest possible expectations made Revelations a pleasant surprise, subsequently raised expectations made Judgment a disappointment, a film at once boring and bewildering. I’m glad we’ve graduated from the drudgery of the middle Hellraiser era, but this final sequel earns no praise for novelty alone. It’s unfortunate, because my understanding was that this was the best since things started going downhill. Tunnicliffe is writing and directing this time (and starring, as the Auditor), so this isn’t another cash grab. He had to fight to make this movie. And it’s strange, because when you read a summary of the treatment, it sounds reasonable enough. But somehow, it never comes together. Or it isn’t enough.\n\nThe film lays all its cards on the table in the opening sequence, wherein Tunnicliffe must have seen an in-development cut of Mad God. This is the Stygian Inquisition, and the Auditor – recalling Seth MacFarlane’s memorable turn in Hellboy II – exposits about a man’s sins before giving way to the Assessor, who literally eats that exposition with two forks, and then other gross things happen. This Hell bureaucracy was inspired by The Scarlet Gospels, and it’s about time we began exploring. I don’t think that contextualizing Pinhead is necessarily a bad thing, though like the Assessor, I may be eating my words by the end of this.\n\nAfter the Silent Hill imagery of that opening, we cut to two detectives in a car exchanging some of the least human dialogue I’ve heard in a while. I assume this film was shot in chronological order, because our two leads, Sean and David, have zero chemistry. And they’re supposed to be brothers, which I didn’t learn until the movie was almost over. They’re investigating a serial killer called the Preceptor, in an office with the exterior of a police station whose other rooms or halls we never see. One day, a detective named Christine walks in and is suddenly on the team. It doesn’t alter the dynamic, or create one.\n\nI mean, how to describe these characters? The movie takes precious screentime (in a sub-90-minute film) to introduce Christine, but for what purpose? Is she a rogue cop on the edge with nothing to lose? By the book? Daring? Corrupt? Please, God, no. And then we have these other two, the lead being “Sean Carter,” which is what you’d call the protagonist of a 24 spin-off. As they’re faffing about, poking at gruesome murder scenes, I’m getting the feeling we’ve violated Vonnegut’s fifth tenet of writing: “Start as close to the end as possible,” in favor of the sixth – a Hellraiser favorite – “Be a sadist.”\n\nWe already sort of know what’s going on, that there’s a new order of hell priests, so why do we have to wait for these detective dorks to figure it out, too? Of course, we soon find that the Preceptor has little to do with that opening sequence. The twist of Judgment centers entirely on the nature of the killer, which means that the police thing is actually at the forefront of the story. Revelations’s lack of setup for payoffs really hurts here, when we’re not leaning on cliché – when, in other words, this story hasn’t been told before. Sean has an encounter with the Inquisition and escapes, meets up with David, and returns with a vengeance. This should be a big moment. We should feel Sean’s anger or David’s fear.\n\nThat’s the other thing. When Sean returns to the Inquisition, it’s a house. There’s a dissonance going on where people are abducted at the door of this house and suddenly they’re in hell. But I’ve been inside enough houses to understand their basic sequence, so it seems the Auditor and Pinhead are chilling in a basement. I feel like Revelations made better use of its budget, though the practical effects and design of the demons in Judgment is certainly welcome. The Stygian types are distinct from the Cenobites, who are then distinct from a third faction introduced late in the film – though certainly not welcome. The contextualization mentioned before takes on a traditional Christian aspect, with talk of “good” and “evil” which would contradict that very famous line about “demons to some, angels to others!”\n\nWe’re making overtures toward a generic Hellraiser here, echoed in micro by the very sound design. While the visuals go for gross more than twisted/sexy – things are chewed and liquified, liquid pours into mouths, there’s a lot of saliva – the sound effects are stock. Most Hellraiser movies have really bad scores, too, which doesn’t altogether create an appropriately eerie soundscape. I don’t understand how the shock of inspiration that created the Stygian Inquisition could also turn its ear away from foley, dialogue, and ultimately decide that the Hellraiser mythology was nothing more than an episode of Lucifer.\n\nWell, when it comes to the final ranking, I’m just as surprised as you are:\n\nHellraiser\n\nHellbound: Hellraiser II\n\nHellraiser: Bloodline\n\nHellraiser III: Hell on Earth\n\nHellraiser: Revelations (!!)\n\nHellraiser: Deader\n\nHellraiser: Hellseeker\n\nHellraiser: Judgment\n\nHellraiser: Hellworld\n\nHellraiser: Inferno\n\nHellraiser (2022)\n\nOnly the modern machinations of film distribution would have Hellraiser and Predator compared so directly. Both are franchise reboots of ‘80s horror properties released exclusively to Hulu, which was for years known to me only as “that website where I watched Samurai Champloo and The Tatami Galaxy in college.” The final kill of the Hellraiser franchise to this point was pretty good, spare the lame CGI. And yet, it was still Pinhead standing there, chains exploding out of brick, hooks in the flesh, a stretched-out face, and a body pulled apart. If we’re so keen on comparison, one of the things Predator has always had, throughout its own tumultuous run, is variety. I’ve watched the Predator kill people with all sorts of cool weapons, in all sorts of cool ways. Pinhead has his one preferred method, and I’ve seen it ten times.\n\nI’d go on about how I don’t want a legacy sequel or a straight remake, but right now, I don’t want another Hellraiser. I have a few days before the film releases, so hopefully I can wash some of it from my brain, but man, this was an ordeal. While Jamie Clayton’s casting as Pinhead is on the order of that most beautiful phrase “Amber Midthunder in the new Predator,” and the trailer is cool, I’m scrambling to remember why I ever liked these movies in the first place. I’m searching for the definition of Hellraiser, a franchise itself torn apart by competing creative interests and financial realities, and lacking the foundation of a true classic helmed by a John Carpenter or Wes Craven, Ridley Scott, and so on.\n\nDon’t get me wrong — Clive Barker is great, and I’ve yet to delve into his epic fantasy books, but I feel like his cinematic Hellraiser was always compromised. I’d be more than willing to believe that this whole mess is entirely the fault of the Weinsteins, and the slight redemption at the end by Tunnicliffe was a Sisyphean victory. But even looking back at the films not discussed here, Hellraiser and Hellraiser II hint at something bigger, and right after that, the series begins its freefall. It isn’t even a series so much as that moment in the sand trap when the ball keeps coming back and you stop counting. If you were to ask me right this moment “What is Hellraiser?” I would not be able to answer sufficiently, and I just spent the last few days watching films four through ten. Hopefully, this new one can achieve a clarity of purpose so often absent, and give female Pinhead something to do, in addition to looking majestic as she always has:"
