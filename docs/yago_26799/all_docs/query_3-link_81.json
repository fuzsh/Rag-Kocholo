        "text": "Clive Barker’s “Hellraiser” is a beautifully campy film. It presents a fascinating universe that leaves me wanting more and helped me to understand what sustains horror Franchises like “Alien” “Friday the 13th” and “Halloween” (and of course many others). The fact that one of my favorite actors is in it (Andrew Robinson – Garak from “Star Trek: Deep Space 9”) is another point in it’s favor and lead to further enjoyment. Also, this was a great film to end the Halloween cycle of horror or supernatural based films.\n\nI am not a horror guy, but I love a good thriller. This is a movie that managed to succeed in pulling off both in equal measure as well as giving us some good fantasy too.\n\nThe film was directed by Clive Barker who also wrote it and based it off his novella The Hellbound Heart, the producer was Christopher Figg.\n\nThe premise begins with Frank Cotton (Sean Chapman) recieving a puzzle box from a mysterious man. After he pays for the box transports him to a hellish world where his body is torn apart. We are then brought to the present where his brother Larry (Andrew Robinson) and Larry’s wife Julia (Clare Higgins) are moving into Larry’s old home where he and Frank grew up. It is here mysterious events begin unfolding as Larry’s blood brings back Frank who had an affair with Julia and asks her to bring him bodies so he can resurrect and they can be together (and so he can escape the beings from the Hell – the Cenobites). From here the story unfolds as Julia tries to hide all this from Larry and their daughter Kirsty as events unfold.\n\nHere is the assessment of the film:\n\nThe Pros: The Special Effects – The effects are beautiful and campy. It kicks off with electricity and the brutal scene of a Frank’s body being torn apart by hooks. These gruesome affects continue as Frank takes the bodies to build his own. We also see the different levels of a human being too, from when he is mostly bone, to when he can taste again but is covered and veins…and finally when he has skin again. The Cenobites also look amazing too with some looking like ogres or trolls, or like demonic dark elves with of course Pinhead as the greatest example being covered in pins and a coat that looks inspired by bondage gear.\n\nThe Cenobites – These guys are great antagonists because they don’t see themselves as bad. They know some people like to be tortured and that they give pleasure while inflicting pain. They are alien and otherworldly and travelers bringing their twisted “Gospel” to those who open the puzzle box. This makes them fascinating and I want to know more about their people…which means I’ll probably watch the other movies later and read some of the comics.\n\nFrank Cotton – This guy is a monster and the primary antagonist, which makes when Kirsty tricks him into falling into the Cenobites trap it is quite rewarding. He uses Frank’s wife Julia on her wedding day and later murders her in cold blood once she’s killed enough people for him. He’s the definition of psychopath and got what he deserved from the Cenobites for escaping them. He’s played by a few different people but the best versions are Oliver Smith who plays him when he’s skinless and Andrew Robinson who plays him when he’s wearing Larry’s skin. He has the charm and terror down the best.\n\nAndrew Robinson – Andrew Robinson does a great job as Larry Cotton, a well meaning guy who is sometimes dominated by social pressure but always come through for his wife…and of course when he is Frank Cotton at the end and laughs as the Cenobites and murders Julia. He does a good job driving this film as he looks like the primary protagonist initially.\n\nJulia Cotton – Julia does a good job playing the conflicted lover who goes bad at the end when she sells her soul in the murders she commits for Frank. Her death isn’t missed as we see her fighting for Larry not to be killed but than going cold after Frank comes clean about the Cenobite threat coming his way. It is than she goes full evil and lets Frank take Larry’s skin. She even tries to kill the daughter Kirsty. Clare Higgins does a great job with what she’s given.\n\nKirsty Cotton – Ashley Laurence does a good job in the young hero role and manages to hold her own against Frank and un-summon the Cenobites. Her boyfriend is just kind of there but her relationship to her father is wonderful and how she fights her Uncle Frank. She is the only one who sees through him, much like her dad did and this gives her what she needs to figure out how to close the puzzle box which saves her and her boyfriend from the Cenobites.\n\nThe Ending – There is a homeless man creeping on Kirsty throughout the film who steals the puzzle box in the end. It turns out the old man who gave frank the box was really the skeletal demonic dragon. This was a cool twist and showed that the Cenobites will always have people seeking them out or helping them in their cause, even after they’re defeated. I liked that since it made it bittersweet as our hero won but the Cenobites are still in action.\n\nOkay: The Soundtrack – The soundtrack isn’t super memorable so I can’t really endorse it.\n\nThe Cons: The Boyfriend – I’m don’t even care about his name he was unmemorable. He’s generic, he’s there and he lends nothing to the plot as the drama revolves around the family. If he’d help figure out that Frank was hiding upstairs or how to defeat the Cenobites he might actually mean something but in the end he lends nothing to the plot and was not needed.\n\nIf you like camp, horror or thrillers…you will probably like this film. I enjoyed it immensely and thought it pulled off everything it needed to do. I cared about the characters, the antagonists were interesting, the universe was rich and there wasn’t a happy ending. It was bittersweet and that is usually the type of film I enjoy. My only issue is the boyfriend could have been an actual character and I wish we could have explored Julia and Larry’s relationship more. Why did she marry him? This question is never fully answered. Regardless, this movie is a favorite and gets a recommend.\n\nFinal Score: 9 / 10. A solidly great campy horror thriller."
