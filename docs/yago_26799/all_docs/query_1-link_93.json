        "text": "Horror fans have a term used to describe films that are great entry points into the genre for the younger set and nascent fans – gateway horror. These gateway films are well executed, but are mostly devoid of anything too violent, subversive, or extreme for a young fan’s eyes.\n\nWith a world as vast as the horror genre however, there are other gateways to walk through. Sometimes you seek out these gateways with an idea of what you’re getting into once you pass through. Other times you stumble into them, completely oblivious to the dark delights that await beyond.\n\nClive Barker’s original Hellraiser is one such film for me – a film I consider a gateway to exploring the more extreme and graphic side of the horror genre.\n\nI had first seen Hellraiser during my burgeoning obsession with horror movies. I had seen plenty of violent films before, and plenty of gore – one of the perks of having parents who didn’t pay all that much attention to what you watched. I grew up on the Alien films, the Predator films, violent action films such as your Die Hards, Lethal Weapons, and the like. My new love for horror had me blazing through the big names in the slasher game.\n\nI was growing up as the analog age was in its dying days. We had one foot in the old, one foot in the new. I still remember corded phones, answering machines, VHS and VCR, pagers, phone booths, smoking areas in restaurants, etc. The Internet was just becoming a thing, and computers weren’t a ubiquitous household item for everyone yet.\n\nIt’s during this specific period where the horror icons of the 70s and 80s felt like real-deal boogeymen. I knew these characters by name, not by the title of the franchises. As a kid, there wasn’t Friday the 13th, A Nightmare On Elm Street, Halloween, or Child’s Play…there was only Jason, Freddy, Michael, and Chucky. You hear rumblings and whispers about these guys at school, hanging out with friends on the weekend, or during a sleepover. These figures were already mythic and iconic long before I ever clapped my eyes on one of their films.\n\nSeeing these films for the first time was like finding a key to a long-locked room. It was uncovering the forbidden. I gaped in delight and glee as these characters and these films became my thing.\n\nBut there was one figure, one film, I had yet to experience.\n\nHellraiser was just another franchise with an iconic killer to get around to at the time. I had no understanding of the true tone of the film, nor did I have any expectations outside of seeing another slasher film. Little did I know Hellraiser was very much not a slasher, and Pinhead and his Cenobites were far from the only monsters in the movie.\n\nDid Hellraiser scare me? No, I rarely ever get scared watching horror movies. That’s not a flex, it’s just how I’m wired. What did happen to me was more akin to getting the wind knocked out of me.\n\nLike I said, I had been exposed to plenty of gore before, but nothing this wet, this red, and this vicious. Flesh was twisted, ripped, and rent in ways far more messy than I had experienced before. The kills in your average Friday the 13th or Halloween sequel are like a punchline to a set-up, a fun release to the build up. They can be bloody, but the camera never lingers for long. They’re akin to a gory magic trick.\n\nHellraiser features Frank – a character who is a walking, talking, open wound the entire runtime – and he’s very drippy. We see various body parts nailed and hung from a rotating obelisk. Chains with hooks on the end literally rip bodies apart. Spending time in the world of Clive Barker’s Hellraiser was like visiting a slaughterhouse in hell.\n\nNever before had violence and gore engaged my senses to such a degree. The viscera on display had a tangible quality to it. It was almost like you could smell the human offal and coppery tinge of blood.\n\nCharacters were in real, prolonged pain. This gore wasn’t a trick. This gore wasn’t a punchline.\n\nIt was real. And it hurt.\n\nThe link between pleasure and pain was also something I wasn’t quite prepared to grapple with on my first viewing of Hellraiser. Sex and death were largely separate in the slashers I was used to. I wasn’t yet engaging in the subtext, intentional or not, with slashers on the mix of sexuality, violence, and death. To me it was just a bit of naughty fun. Some of these characters would have sex, then a few scenes later, they would get the axe. The lurid aspect of the slasher film is what attracts younger fans to begin with – the naughty factor.\n\nIn Hellraiser, sex and pleasure are the main motivator for our dual antagonists Frank and Julia. The overwhelming need they each have to reach the ultimate point of pleasure, to get lost in it and revel in it turns them into monsters of the highest order. For Frank and Julia, blood acts as just another bodily fluid to be shared in their pursuit of pleasure. Murder isn’t a means to an end, it’s all part of the pleasure. The carnal, wanton need to push the boundaries, to seek it out no matter the personal cost is what directly leads to most of the bloodshed in the film. Where is the line between pleasure and pain? Frank found it. Julia found it. They think they’ve mastered it. But the Cenobites know better. They take your desires and pervert them in the ultimate ironic punishment.\n\nNeedless to say, all of this floored me when I first saw it. I didn’t grasp all of what Hellraiser had to say at the time, but I knew it was saying something and I also knew I just stepped over a new threshold in the world of horror movies, a threshold that broadened my horizons for the genre outside of slashers and creature features.\n\nTo this day, the audacity of Hellraiser still surprises me. Of course there are far more violent and perverse genre films out there, but Hellraiser is still pretty brazen for a mainstream, wide release genre picture. It’s not just the sheer level of depravity you can toss at the screen that makes it impactful. It’s how you do it and what you’re saying with it. It’s the perfect calibration of Barker’s vision and the team he had behind him in making the film that still gives Hellraiser its power to shock and horrify and even titillate.\n\nLike the Lament Configuration itself, Hellraiser is the key to sites unseen for burgeoning fans of horror movies. Just be sure you’re ready to unlock that door.\n\nTo paraphrase Pinhead, Hellraiser has such sights to show you.\n\nI think part of our collective fascination with serial killers comes from an empathetic desire to uncover exactly what needs to go wrong for a human being to snap and turn into a murderer. That’s why it makes sense that this form of morbid curiosity lies at the heart of so many successful horror stories, with countless genre filmmakers trying their best to explore the minds of predators.\n\nAnd in honor of M. Night Shyamalan’s latest thriller expertly allowing us to see through the eyes of a cold-blooded murderer, we’ve decided to come up with a list highlighting six other serial killer movies told from the killer’s perspective. After all, there are plenty of interesting cinematic killers out there, and not all of them are as charming as Josh Hartnett in Trap.\n\nAs usual, don’t forget to comment below with your own murderous favorites if you think we missed a particularly thrilling one. And while we won’t be including it on the list, I’d also like to give a shout-out to Chris Nash’s avant-garde slasher In a Violent Nature, which follows a Jason-Voorhees-inspired murderer as he embarks on a vengeful rampage.\n\nWith that out of the way, onto the list…\n\n6. Mr. Brooks (2007)\n\nI can’t be the only one who wishes Kevin Costner did more horror movies. While Bruce A. Evans’ deep dive into the mind of a fractured man is more of a psychological thriller than a proper scary movie, it’s still proof that Costner can be legitimately terrifying when he chooses to be.\n\nTelling the story of a seemingly normal man who secretly struggles to keep his murderous alter ego under control, Mr. Brooks doesn’t exactly re-invent the serial killer wheel with its ruminations on addiction, but you can’t help but sympathize with Costner as his double life spirals out of control.\n\nAnd if you like this one, don’t forget to check out our interview with the director as he explores the film’s unmade sequels!\n\n5. Maniac (1980)\n\nIt’s rare that both a horror film and its remake are equally good explorations of their respective subject matter, but since we already included Franck Khalfoun’s Maniac on our list recommending six experimental slashers, today I’d like to highlight the grimy thrills of William Lustig’s 1980 original. It may not feature the same POV gimmick as its 2012 successor, but Maniac still does a phenomenal job of putting viewers in the shoes of a deeply disturbed individual.\n\nFollowing a murderous landlord as he slays (and scalps) his way through New York City, this brutal character study is only enhanced by its low production value and seedy Manhattan backdrop. Lustig makes the most of eerie street corners and dark alleyways here, making this film a memorable portrait of urban chaos – as well as one hell of a disturbing gore-fest.\n\n4. The House that Jack Built (2018)\n\nEven Lars von Trier’s more conventional films tend to tackle controversial subject matter, but The House that Jack Built takes the director’s penchant for dark stories to the next level with its portrayal of a deeply malevolent man that embodies all the worst traits of famous serial killers. Feeling a lot like an art-house companion piece to American Psycho, this mean-spirited romp is so gruesome that you often forget it’s meant to be satirical.\n\nFrom animal cruelty to the disturbingly realistic slaughter of innocent women, this is one of the most uncomfortable movies on this list, but it also features a mesmerizing performance by the incredibly talented Matt Dillon. That alone already makes it worth the price of admission. I wouldn’t recommend this one to duck lovers, though.\n\n3. Peeping Tom (1960)\n\nMoral panics are nothing new, especially when it comes to media depicting grisly acts of murder. And while some desensitized viewers might not understand why this 1960 thriller nearly ruined its director’s career, I think Peeping Tom still holds up as one of the UK’s earliest example of schlocky exploitation.\n\nA surprisingly meta story about the thrills of watching others die on celluloid, Peeping Tom introduces us to an aspiring filmmaker who secretly murders women and produces snuff films about their dying moments – a decidedly modern premise for a movie produced decades before the slasher craze.\n\n2. Man Bites Dog (1992)\n\nOne of the most shocking examples of Found Footage/mockumentary filmmaking that doesn’t involve the paranormal, this pioneer Belgian flick is way more influential than most genre fans give it credit for. Inspiring everything from Behind the Mask: The Rise of Leslie Vernon to What We Do in the Shadows, Man Bites Dog is another case of storytellers using serial killing as an excuse to explore our fascination with violent media.\n\nAnd while the film is presented as a serious documentary about a charming murderer who slowly recruits the filmmakers to his cause, it’s the satirical undertones that make it so effective. That being said, you’ll likely forget the humorous elements when Ben commits some of the most heinous acts ever put on film.\n\n1. Henry: Portrait of a Serial Killer (1986)\n\nHenry: Portrait of a Serial Killer is loosely inspired by claims made by real life murderer Henry Lee Lucas (as well as his partner in crime Otis Toole), and while most of the supposed 600 deaths once attributed to Henry have since been proven to be false confessions, John McNaughton’s low budget character study escapes its sensationalist True Crime origins due to its honest and unflinching portrayal of antisocial behavior.\n\nFrom the gritty 16mm photography to the frighteningly realistic death scenes, there’s plenty to love about this controversial indie flick. However, the film’s greatest asset is a young Michael Rooker in a career-making role as our disturbed main character.\n\nJust make sure you don’t choose this one for family movie night."
