        "text": "It’s hard to say if I’m a fan of the Hellraiser franchise. Sure, the sequels are all garbage, that much we can agree on, I’m oddly compelled to revisit the 1987 film at least once a year (usually around Halloween because you know your boy gets way too into the witchery of the spooking season), I enjoy the novella, and I can even appreciate the second Hellraiser movie as a piece of over-the-top 80s exploitation – but no Hellraiser story has ever made me feel anywhere close to the emotions that I get when I think about Hellraiser.\n\nI recently pre-ordered a collection of Hellraiser comics written by Clive Barker – I had read a lot of glowing reviews from people saying that they recaptured the essence of the franchise. The best thing since the original movie they said. The omnibus was supposed to arrive on Halloween itself – October 31st aka All Hallow’s Ween – but it was pushed back 2 weeks. My anticipation mounted even more. I couldn’t wait to finally appreciate something that fulfilled the promise of Hellraiser – I was ready for Clive Barker to take me straight to hell, no more of these weird film detours. He would be the guy to do it after all, who better than the creator of the franchise to understand and make the most of the concept right?\n\nI suppose you can imagine where this is going. Not only did the comics have a kind of stilted, rushed feeling (maybe Barker is more used to pacing out a novel compared to writing a comic script – or maybe the episodic nature of each issue’s release caused things to unfold in a weird way), they seemed to double down on the parts of Hellraiser that didn’t work. So anyway, here we are. I’m trapped in this blog for the rest of eternity so I figure I might as well make the most of this online hell by writing out some of my thoughts.\n\nSo what makes Hellraiser good then, smart guy?\n\nGlad you asked, internet asshole! Let’s talk about the general concept. Let’s grab our rusty hooks and strip away all the skin and get to the juicy insides of the story. I promise that’s the only time I’ll do a writerly flourish like that. OK? Cool. Deal.\n\nThe thing that hooked me (fuck, sorry, last one) was the original, inciting story of Frank from the original film and novella. He was a mega horny dude that got bored of even the freakiest sex he could find on earth, so he went to the ends of the earth to find this mythical box that was supposed to unlock feelings so unfathomable, he couldn’t even comprehend them even as a super experienced sex haver.\n\nAnd then, yeah, we’ve seen the movie, he finally tracks down the box, opens it, and is shocked when instead of sexy bikini babes, he’s greeted by demon leather daddies and mistresses who then take him to hell where he’ll suffer unfathomable pain and pleasure for the rest of eternity.\n\nIt’s a brilliant concept. Think of how it differs from most horror. The villains are not evil – they just have lived so long and are so numb to feeling that they have trouble telling the difference between pain and pleasure. And the victim is not just some innocent person getting picked off – he’s getting a monkey’s paw kind of version of exactly what he wanted. You got bored and wanted to feel something new? Well you got it buddy! Sorry if it’s too much for your human brain to handle.\n\nAnd the best part? Despite seeing plenty of the bad guys, we don’t know anything about them. At some point in the first movie they say they are from a different dimension. In most other contexts that would sound dumb, but it’s easy to believe. They seem almost alien. Their outfit and weird mutilation has a certain otherworldly logic to it. And it follows the golden rule of horror – what you don’t see is scariest. We see glimpses of their torture methods, but you can only imagine what kind of insane techniques they’ve come up with after doing this one specific thing for eons. Even though Frank seems like a hedonistic bastard, you still can’t help but think “damn, this dude’s soul is fucked.”\n\nBut this is where the disappointment comes in. Each subsequent piece of Hellraiser media can’t help but expand the lore of the Cenobites, and each time it does, it undercuts what makes them compelling. Even in the first movie, we get this beautiful horror setup, only for us to see a teenage Kirsty successfully bargain with and then outsmart these immortal elder demons. Then in the second, we visit their world and hmmm aahhh I guess this incomprehensible interdimensional hellscape is uhhh a spooky MC Escher maze with some Halloween spider web decorations?\n\nWhich then brings us to the comics. Instead of going the other way with it, maybe wheeling it back and restoring some dignity to the Cenobites, I was very dismayed to see that the comics take it even further. They downright humanize Pinhead right from the start.\n\nWe go back to the drab maze world of the second movie (guess that’s canon now) where we see Pinhead dealing with his demon ennui. “Ho hum” he says. “Torturing people is no fun anymore” he thinks to himself. “There’s no spark left in this BDSM relationship” he tells another Cenobite who I guess is his girlfriend – she tries to talk some sense into him but he’s made up his mind. He wants to go back to Earth.\n\nThe comic also features Kirsty on a revenge mission. It’s another inspired concept wasted – we find out that the Lament Configuration, the puzzle box that unleashes Pinhead and his Cenobite crew is only one of several different talismans on earth. Each of them unleashes a different group of hell demons with their own methods of torture. Yes. Cool.\n\nBut then we see Kirsty and a band of Cenobite survivors quickly and fairly easily destroy these horcruxes and the demons contained within. If the Cenobites had lost their mystique at the end of the first movie, they are almost completely neutered in the comics.\n\nThe scope and story kind of goes off the rails from there. We find out that Pinhead has a master plan to return to earth and weasel his way into becoming a Mega Hell Man, Kirsty becomes Lady Pinhead, and the end basically boils down to a horror version of the Marvel “blue laser in the sky is going to end the world” trope.\n\nDefinitely not to knock anyone that enjoys the comics – Clive Barker is a master storyteller and there are some great moments and it’s certainly the best the franchise has been since the 80s. But like I said, this isn’t the side of Hellraiser that gets my brain a-tinglin.\n\nSo how would you make Hellraiser good then, smart guy?\n\nGlad you asked, online piece of shit! Hellraiser may have been the kind of concept best served to a single movie where your brain can fill in all the ideas hinted at in the margins. But if they’re insisting on making more of these movies, might as well try and make them as good as we can, huh?\n\nLike I said before, Clive Barker knows his shit, and I think the comics already give us a real close framework to follow.\n\nJust remove all the stuff about Pinhead and his hell sorrows and we’re practically there. After her whole family got taken down by the Cenobites, Kirsty is now on a mission to track down the box and prevent other people from having the same fate. But, as she investigates more, she finds out that the box is just the beginning. Each box has its own separate hells and demons with their own special brand of eternal suffering.\n\nMost important of all – make them mysterious. Show as little as you possibly can. In fact, it may not even be necessary to show the demons until the very end. You could easily have the movie be about Kirsty playing detective and tracking down these other boxes. She sees the aftermath, maybe hears from people about the unfathomable shit they saw, but you only get glimpses of the true horror that the box unleashes.\n\nAnd if you really want to make em scary – make em unbeatable. Remember movies like The Strangers, The Ring, Nightmare on Elm Street, No Country for Old Men, etc? They were unsettling because the good guys don’t win. The evil entity continues on their merry way, ready to hop out of your big square early-2000s TV or shoot you with that cow gun bolt thing. That’s the sort of horror ending that stays with you. The first Hellraiser film flirted with the idea of having the monster live to spook another day, but c’mon a whole gang of hell demons were outsmarted and beaten by a couple 80s-hair teens. The next person that gets caught up in all this has a decent shot of figuring out a way to get out of hell – maybe you could challenge Pinhead to a fiddle duel like in my fanfiction, I don’t know.\n\nLISTEN, I know that obviously there are a lot of factors that make it difficult to just stick the ideal Hellraiser story on screen or on a comic page. There are deadlines and money involved that make it difficult to create a singular vision. In fact I’m pretty sure I read somewhere that a lot of the (bad) sequels started out as already-written scripts that were purchased on the cheap and then (poorly) adapted to include Pinhead and the Hellraiser crew so the studio could hold onto the rights. Also I recognize that most of the time “here’s how you REALLY do a thing” articles like these are amateur dumbasses like me thinking they could do something better than professionals, but it feels like everyone agrees the films are not living up to their potential, but I haven’t seen many ideas of how we can bring things back to their former GORY lol.\n\nWith all that in mind I will volunteer to do this for little-to-no money out of the purity and charity of my little heart. My only demand is that I am allowed to join the Writer’s Guild though so I can get my greasy little hands on those sweet sweet screeners. Also I have experience reinventing franchises that have lost their way, please see my real full-length Rush Hour 4 script where Jackie Chan and Chris Tucker go back in time to fight in the Civil War and defeat racism.\n\nBut all joking aside folks, friends, I think Hellraiser is interesting in that unlike other horror franchises that have long-since used up all their best ideas, Hellraiser’s potential seems to be still untapped. The first film is undeniably the best, but even Clive Barker admits it’s far from perfect. And the comics – while well-written and full of interesting ideas – seem to stray from the otherworldly horror of the original story.\n\nIf we’re going to keep making more of these damn things, why not put some thought into what makes Hellraiser stand apart and create something that might appeal to people outside of its die-hard (haha like you die hard in hell I guess? Sort of a play on words) fanbase?\n\nThank you for somehow reading this entire thing, god bless you, turns out this article was hell all along. Now you’re dead motherfuker. Bye!\n\nWith Pacific Rim coming out in a matter of days, director Guillermo del Toro and his long-time collaborator buddy Ron Perlman have been making the press rounds. Naturally, the question of Hellboy 3 has come up. The good news is they both want to do it, and the timing may be right as far as studios handing over the budget needed, especially if Pacific Rim ends up being the satisfying, successful blockbuster this summer desperately needs. Sorry, looking at you Man of Steel.\n\nPeople aren’t just clamoring for Hellboy because they enjoyed the first two and they want more of the same. The Hellboy story still needs to be finished. Well, technically the story of Hellboy could go on endlessly, as it has roots in adventure serials, detective novels, and of course, comic books. All of which are more episodic in nature (more on this shit later). I’d gladly pay to see Ron Perlman and Doug Jones be supernatural buddy cops and fight new and interesting foes until the end of time, but Del Toro clearly has an ending for the series in mind. Each movie so far has foreshadowed a very clear finale for the movie: they have mentioned that Hellboy’s true destiny is to destroy the earth. A final movie in the trilogy could not only provide closure to the series, but it could give del Toro a chance to perfect the amazing mish-mash of genres that is Hellboy.\n\nDon’t get me wrong, I love the Hellboy films. Hellboy 2 has so much imagination, heart, and humor packed into it it’s astounding. But I was watching some Hellboy special features where Guillermo del Toro was explaining what first drew him to the character in the first place, and something he said stuck out to me. He said, “It’s like if an X-file was investigation X-files.”\n\nWhich got me thinking about an aspect of Hellboy we have yet to see. We haven’t gotten a great sense of him just doing his job–day-in and day-out. There are plenty of ways to show this, but it might be helpful to take a cue from classic detective and adventure movies. Like I said before, Hellboy at its core is just a great adventure/detective story. Think about the gold standard for all adventure movies: Indiana Jones. The opening of each film (except maybe Kingdom of the Crystal Skull, I think?) has Indy on a mission searching for an item that is unrelated to the film’s main plot. The golden idol in Raiders of the Lost Ark, in Temple of Doom the ashes of an emperor, and in The Last Crusade young Indy is trying to retrieve the cross of Coronado. Sure, each opening segment introduces important characters and themes, but the point is, the unrelated openings show that Indy does this shit all the time, and he’s good as fuck at it. A detective/private eye movie does the same thing. Take one of the gold standards of that genre: Chinatown. The film starts with the main character, Jake, investigating a run-of-the-mill case. We see how he handles himself, how he conducts his work, and that he is clearly too skilled and overqualified for such a simple job. By the time the film’s main conflict is introduced, the audience is completely on board, and shares in Jake’s curiosity about a high-profile new case.\n\nStarting a film like with the character already in the middle of a job is the equivalent of watching an episode in the middle of a season of the X-files, or reading a random issue of Hellboy. The story stands on its own, but we have an innate understanding that these characters are taking care of business regularly. That these characters and this world is rich with backstory and history. But films work differently. They must work as their own, full experience. Which is why a character as iconic as Indiana Jones still needs to have establishing moments 2 movies deep into his franchise. It strengthens the character, which in turn strengthens the plot.\n\nThat’s one thing I think that the Hellboy films have been without. The main conflict is introduced, and Hellboy must struggle against powerful foes to stop a bad thing from happening. Each monster he fights is an obstacle in his path blocking him from accomplishing this main goal. Now, in most films this wouldn’t be a problem, and unrelated plots would only distract from the movie’s main source of conflict. But to see Hellboy struggle to overcome impossible odds has less meaning because we as an audience don’t know what this Hellboy is capable of. Even if we are familiar with the comics or have seen the previous films. Hellboy 3 would be a great chance to see Hellboy and Abe Sapien show off their monster hunting skills to their fullest and really succeed at a task. The audience will understand how they handle things and do their job. Then, when the shit seriously hits the fan and Hellboy and his crew begin to falter, we’ll understand just how powerful this new enemy is.\n\nAt the heart of it, this may be just a case of “show, don’t tell.” We are told throughout the movie that Hellboy and the Bureau for Paranormal Research and Defense are always dealing with some kind of crazy monster, and Hellboy reacts to these terrifying creatures with a “eh, just another day at the office” kind of attitude, but we never really get a full sense of how things function before the film’s main conflict comes along and screws everything up. Hellboy’s job, and his attitude towards it could be developed through us seeing him tackle multiple cases throughout the film.\n\nI think del Toro nailed one of the main reasons the whole concept of Hellboy is so fascinating with the “an X-file investigating X-files” line. The only problem is, each movie has only been one file. Hellboy 3 could be an opportunity to get a more in-depth look at what Hellboy’s job entails, and what his strengths and limits are by seeing him handle two or more cases in succession.\n\nBut the bottom line is, Guillermo del Toro clearly knows what he’s doing so I’m not really worried about Hellboy 3 and the future of the series. I’d just like to see more of Hellboy and Abe and the rest of his buds at the Bureau for Paranormal Research and Defense being fleshed out as much as possible, and this may be a way to do it effectively.\n\nWay back in July of 2011, I reviewed Quentin Tarantino’s recently leaked script for Django Unchained. You can read my review here. First of all, I’d like to apologize for reading the script even though it wasn’t officially released. 2011 was a weird time. Was the world really going to end in 2012? Would Obama get re-elected? Would I finally realize my dream of becoming a blogging superstar? But most importantly, everyone was wondering if Tarantino’s new film would deliver as much tension, excitement, and straight up film-making glee as his previous movies. Luckily, everything turned out for the best. 2013 has just rolled around and the world hasn’t ended, Obama is our president, I am the world’s most popular and successful blogger, and Django Unchained turned out to more than live up to the Tarantino name both in thrills and in depth. For more on the “depth” part of that, check out my other article about Django Unchained. Yeah I’m on a Tarantino writing kick. So what? Wanna fight? Go ahead. Click that X in the corner. See if I care. Go on do it. I dare you…\n\nNO WAIT COME BACK. I was just kidding. Please stay a while on my blog.\n\nBut anyway, sometimes it’s fun to look back. Django Unchained turned out to be pretty damn good, but how does it compare to the script completed over a year ago? The differences provide an interesting look into Tarantino’s writing and editing process, as well as explain a confusing choice included in the final film. So let’s take a look.\n\nWhat Was Cut From the Script?\n\nBefore we get into the nitty-gritty here, I should explain a few things. First, Tarantino has clearly said several times that when he’s writing, he is writing for the page. He isn’t necessarily planning on including every single scene and bit of dialogue in the completed movie, and a lot of the time he will add things to the script in order to make it read more like a novel. So some of the stuff that didn’t make it to the screen may have never been intended to be filmed anyway. Though, many of these scenes were probably filmed. Up until a couple of weeks before Django’s premiere, Tarantino was sitting on a 3+ hour cut. Which would have been fine by me.\n\nRegardless of Tarantino’s intentions with these scenes, anyone interested in writing films, or anyone interested in how a film is made can get some insight through these examples. Great writing doesn’t just happen on the page or on the screen. A lot of great writing happens through editing and character work, and the stuff we see in Tarantino’s earlier script draft show just how much of a master he is at that kind of stuff.\n\nAlso, I just want to make it clear I’m not going line-by-line here. I don’t have all damn day, OK? Actually I do, but I’m going to be talking about main plot points and things like that anyway. So if you don’t like it, feel free to kiss my butt. Just kidding. Stay.\n\nBroomhilda’s Backstory\n\nOne of the main things cut out from the film is much of Broomhilda and Django’s backstory, which was to be told in a flashback. In the completed film, we only learn about the past from what Django reveals when talking to Dr. Schultz, or through extremely brief flashback sequences, where we see all the horror, but none of the story of their shared past.\n\nThe script, on the other hand, diverged for a bit about Django and Broomhilda’s past under the Brittle Brothers. We saw more of the torture they endured, and what would have been possibly the most disturbing scene in the film: where the Brittle brothers rape Broomhilda and force Django to watch.\n\nTarantino mentioned in an interview that due to his encyclopedic knowledge of film, he has become a bit desensitized to movie violence, and has no problem separating it from reality. But when he put some of the more extreme scenes of violence in front of an audience, it became clear which scenes went to far. I’d assume these scenes ended up being cut for time as well as content.\n\nAdditionally, the script took a pretty large detour when describing Broomhilda’s situation after being separated from Django at the Greenville Slave Auction. She ended up being sold to a family where she served as a non-consenting girlfriend for the meek son of the family. The son eventually lost her to Calvin Candie. I’ve heard rumors that this role of the son was supposed to be played by Joseph Gordon-Levitt, then Sacha Baron Cohen, and then Jonah Hill, who all eventually dropped out. Jonah Hill then supposedly came back when he had an opening to play a smaller part. Or at least that’s what I’ve heard.\n\nBUT, to be honest, this portion of script seems like one of those instances where Tarantino was writing for the page, and not for the screen. It was interesting getting more of an idea of Broomhilda’s past and the journey she took to end up being in the clutches of Calvin Candie, but on film, it may have been too much time to spend on something that wasn’t related to the film’s main revenge storyline.\n\nWriters, take note. Even though it didn’t make it to the screen, this is how in-depth Tarantino gets on all of his characters. He’s mentioned before that for films like Inglourious Basterds, he told every actor that played a member of the Basterds what they were doing before the war, and what they were going to do afterwards. When you know your characters this well, then you have the ability to let what you know about their personality to dictate where a scene is going to go rather than you forcing them into actions that may not fit who they are. Just some tips from a guy that sucks at writing. Feel free to ignore.\n\nDr. Schultz and Django\n\nMore of Dr. Schultz and Django’s general palling around was included in the script. Instead of Django being a naturally good marksman, we instead got several training sequences where Dr. Schultz teaches Django how to quick draw and how to shoot and also how to read, which we saw a bit of in the final movie. There definitely is more of their buddy-cop kind of camaraderie somewhere out there on some Hollywood cutting room floor and gosh darnit, I’d like to see it. Luckily, I’m sure a lot of this will be on a DVD or “Blu Ray” for you all you fancy people out there with your your HD’s and 1080p’s and your Netscapes and stuff. Good for you. Yeah. Enjoy it. See if I care.\n\nStephen and Django\n\nMore of Stephen and Django’s interactions were included. There was a scene in which Django calls Stephen up to his room, and then discreetly beats him up, knowing that Stephen can’t complain to Candie, who has taken a liking to Django. This is further cause for Stephen to suspect that something is up with Schultz and his partner, which ultimately leads to Stephen figuring out their ruse.\n\nAdditionally, in the scene where Django is hanging naked upside-down, Stephen takes the time to not only fondle Django’s genitals a little bit, he also cuts him and burns his nipples. Again, this is probably due to the film being too violent for general audiences in its uncut form.\n\nMore about Mandingos\n\nWhile Calvin Candie’s interest in Mandingo fighting is still very present in the final film, there is more of a subplot involving the buying and selling of Mandingo fighters. This includes the character of Ace Woody, who was supposed to be Candie’s slave trainer. The character was supposed to be played by either Kevin Costner or Kurt Russel, both of whom ended up dropping out.\n\nAce Woody was eventually dropped along with a good portion of the Mandingo subplot, and some of his more important actions like almost cutting off Django’s balls were given to the character of Billy Crash instead–who played a much smaller role in the original script. It’s interesting to think that in some alternate universe, there is footage of Kevin Costner grabbing Jamie Foxx’s genitals, but alas, it was not to be.\n\nAustralians\n\nSome were pretty confused (and rightfully so) at Tarantino’s inclusion of Australians at the end of the film. And were even more confused at Tarantino’s decision to play one of these Australian fellows. I’ve heard an explanation that it was a nod to a film where an actor had such a terrible Southern accent, that people claimed it sounded Australian. While this might also be true, we can chalk this choice up to another detail left out in editing.\n\nIn the script, when traveling Django to the LeQuint Dickey Mining Company, Django was able to convince the Australian guys to let him go by relating to them. One of the Australians explained that the mining company paid for their passage to America, and that they were working off their debt over the course of several years. Django was able to gain their trust by explaining that they were slaves as well in a manner of speaking, being taken advantage of and being forced to do work for free.\n\nHe then used this trust to convince them of the bounty waiting for them back at Candyland, and then he totally explodes them with dynamite.\n\nThe Ending\n\nSpeaking of dynamite, this movie was an explosive thrill ride! Sorry I just thought I’d add that in case someone wanted to but my stupid dumbass blog on a DVD cover or something.\n\nThe original script played pretty much the same as what we saw on the screen, other than the minor cuts explained above. However, Tarantino changed the ending quite a bit.\n\nInstead of a final massacre of the rest of the film’s villains in the Candie household, Django intercepted the wrongdoers on their way back from Calvin’s funeral. He then gives all six of them guns and holsters. When they reach for their guns, Django uses his quickdraw skills to kill all 6 of them before they can get a shot off. He then throws a bundle of dynamite among the wounded and blows them the heck up. Then he and Broomhilda ride off and probably make a bunch of babies with weird names and live happily ever after.\n\nSo as you can see, a pretty good amount was cut from the film. Not too surprising, considering that Tarantino had a 3 hour+ film on his hands less than a month before it was released. And while what he cut it down to was quite cohesive and entertaining as hell, the world of Django Unchained is one I’d like to spend as much time in as possible, so I am anxious to see some deleted scenes.\n\nAlso, there were some loose ends that weren’t in the script, and were never explained, such as Zoe Bell’s red scarfed tracker that had her own introducing shot, but was quickly gunned down once Django made his violent entrance on the trackers’ cabin. While he was brief, Walter Goggins (Billy Crash in the film) said this about the character: “Yeah, you don’t really get anything from her character but she’s lethal.” So yeah. Color me intrigued.\n\nTarantino has even said he will most likely do a director’s cut some time down the road. Hopefully this will happen, I’d like to see what is included, how that affects the overall pacing, and hopefully more Jamie Foxx and Christoph Waltz being rootin tootin cowboy buddies.\n\nThis is the first time I’ve read a script before seeing a film, and it was a really enlightening experience. Tarantino has said that he considers the film’s final edit to be his final draft of the script, and I see exactly what he means now. While a lot of interesting and compelling content was cut, it ultimately led to a film that is engaging, entertaining, and leaves the audience wanting more.\n\nAlright. That’s about all I have to say about Django Unchained for right now. Feel free to tell me I stink in the comments or just post your thoughts or whatever. Also feel free to click around on my blog anywhere you like. You have my permission. OK. I’m done. Play me out, Frank Ocean.\n\nFor those not in the know, Quentin Tarantino has mentioned that his movies exist in two separate universes. They exist either in his “realer than real” universe, or his “movie movie” universe. Most of his films fall under the “realer than real” category, which Tarantino has said is his heightened version of reality. A heightened version of reality where Hitler’s face got totally shot and exploded, and guys that look like Sam Jackson are EVERYWHERE. However, he has also said that both Kill Bill and From Dusk Til Dawn exist in his “movie movie” universe. Meaning these are the movies that the people in his “realer than real” universe go an see.\n\nThere are a few rules for each universe regarding characters. The “Movie Movie” universe is the only Tarantino universe where characters like Hattori Hanzo and Pai Mei can come from other fictional universes and be a part of the action. The characters in his “real” universe can make appearances in his other “real” universe movies, but characters from other fiction can not, and his “real” characters cannot appear in the “movie universe.”\n\nI probably explained that terribly, but there are plenty of places online that lay things out better than me. Check out this Cracked.com article or this handy bullet-point list if you’re the type of person that likes these explained coherently. Simply put, if a character from Pulp Fiction, Reservoir Dogs, Inglourious Basterds, True Romance, or Death Proof went to go see a movie, they might see From Dusk Til Dawn or Kill Bill on the marquee.\n\nSo now the question arises, now that Django Unchained has come out, which universe does it belong in? Due to its similarity with Inglourious Basterds, I think many are assuming Django can be placed in the “real” universe. In my opinion though, the case isn’t as cut and dry and many Tarantino enthusiasts claim it to be, I’d argue that Django Unchained belongs in the “movie movie” universe.\n\nThe most compelling evidence for this is Tarantino stating in no uncertain terms that Django and Broomhilda are ancestors of John Shaft. You know, from the movie Shaft? Which can be confirmed by Broomhilda’s last name, mentioned a few times in the movie: von Shaft. I guess at some point the Shafts thought the “von” made the name less phallic so they dropped it. Good move. But anyway, as the Tarantino Universe rules mention, characters from unrelated works of fiction can not appear in the “real” universe. Which can then be extrapolated to also mean the ancestors of fictional characters. If they were in the “real” universe, how could Django and Broomhilda be the great-great-grandparents of a fictional character? It wouldn’t make sense.\n\nAnd even beyond that small bit of evidence, the very theme of “mythology” that is present in Django Unchained seems to confirm this theory. Remember the quick flashback at the end, where Dr. Schultz tells Django that he’ll be “known as the fastest gun in the South”? That is the moment that solidifies Django’s status as more as a folk hero, and less as a real person. The film also strengthens Django’s legend status by going out of its way to point out his story’s similarity to that of Broomhila and Siegfried in German folklore. We’re not necessarily watching a “Tarantino” movie, we’re watching a folk tale.\n\nThis also explains why Django Unchained seems to lack a lot of the Tarantino staples. Why is Broomhilda relegated to being simply the damsel in distress that needs saving, when Tarantino normally writes stronger, more complex female characters? Why does this film lack Tarantino’s usual non-linear storytelling? Why does it have very few asides in the dialogue? Why are all the villains so over-the-top in their evil and ignorance? Why is our hero seemingly invincible? Where are all those sexy, sexy feet shots that Tarantino loves to include? Are all these examples due to laziness, or bad writing, or Tarantino losing his touch? No. I’d argue those distinct Tarantino elements aren’t there because we’re not watching a film set in Tarantino’s real universe. We are watching a legend that is being presented in the “movie” universe.\n\nOr (SPOILERS by the way) think back to the torture sequence. What was the worst punishment Stephen could think of for Django? Not castration, not being torn apart by dogs, but having his name and his legend go untold. So that was ultimately the punishment they chose for him, they sent him to a place that was going to replace his name with a number, take away his voice, work him until he died, and then finally throw him into a mass grave. In a “real” universe, torture and death are the ultimate threat, but since this is mythology, the threat of taking away a hero’s identity is far greater than simply killing him.\n\nThat’s what I took away from the film at least. I’ve only seen it twice, and my mind may change after subsequent viewings, but I think it’s safe to say that at the very least, the story of Django is a tale that any character in Tarantino’s “real” universe just as well as a German knows the story of Broomhilda and Siegfried. It’s a Southern fairy tale. If the story of Django is a legend told in Tarantino’s “realer than real” universe, and I think it would then make sense that Django Unchained is a film adaptation of that story, which would place it firmly in the “movie movie” universe.\n\nBoy, we really went down the rabbit hole of geekery on that one, huh? Hopefully some of that makes sense. I know it’s not a fully formed idea, but I think it’s definitely worth some thought for those that are interested in the “Tarantino Universe” discussion. Feel free to discuss further or call me a dope in the comments.\n\nI have some big things in the works that I will be rolling out very soon, but as of right now, please enjoy some musings on a movie I just recently saw.\n\nEarlier today, I saw Life of Pi, and like many other great creative works I’ve come across, I haven’t been able to get it out of my head. Partially because of the film’s insanely gorgeous imagery, but also because I’ve been wrestling with its themes and ideas. It’s been out for a while, so I feel comfortable spoiling the movie in this.\n\nAfter reading the general response online, though, I realized I interpreted the ending of the film differently than most people I came across.\n\nWARNING: I can’t really talk about the movie’s themes unless I talk about the ending, when everything comes together. So if you haven’t seen it, and are the kind of person that likes to go into a movie fresh, this is your warning. Maybe you can go read a music article of mine! Scroll down. Have fun on my blog. You are more than welcome. Feel free to click on whatever you want. Make suggestions for things and I’ll probably do them. Go nuts! You have my permission.\n\nI think I should also mention I haven’t read the book, I’m going purely by film here. Ok, so. I think a lot of people, when describing Life of Pi, will say that it is the story of a boy stranded on a lifeboat with a tiger. Which, in a way is true, but isn’t quite the whole picture. It’s the story of a man telling the story of being stranded on a lifeboat with a tiger. This is an important distinction I’ll get into later. SPOILER ALERT FOR REAL. SPOILERS START HERE OK??? At the end, we find out that the beautiful, exciting, and heartbreaking story we just heard this man tell was actually fiction. In reality, he was alone, and the animals that we saw share the lifeboat with him were actually representative of humans that all ended up dead. His mother included. Once he tells the story, he asks his audience–an author interested in his story–which he prefers. The truth, or the fiction. The author answers that he prefers the story with the tiger, which is the obvious answer. It’s got a dang tiger in it! It’s a winner. Gladiator had tigers. It won Best Picture. Coincidence? Whatever.\n\nThis part is important: when the author answers that he prefers the version with the tigers, Pi answers, “Thank you.” And then says, “And so it goes with God.”\n\nA lot of people were disappointed with the ending of this film. They feel disappointed that the events that actually took place were never shown, they were only explained in expository dialogue. They considered it a betrayal. Like a movie ending with the protagonist waking up and being told the whole thing was a dream. They felt cheated that their emotions were so invested in what amounts to a lie. Extrapolating on those ideas, many think the movie’s supporting telling yourself lies to avoid the harsher truth. And in turn it’s supporting being religious just to make yourself feel better even though you’re skeptical.\n\nWhich I totally understand, by the way. If you were disappointed by the ending, you are not wrong. BUT, I interpreted things differently. To me, the film isn’t about religion. It isn’t about dealing with trauma. It’s about storytelling. It’s about communicating emotions.\n\nI don’t consider Pi’s story of the tiger to be a coping device. He tells the true story to the author without hesitation, and when pressed enough by the Japanese boat company guys, he explains the events that took place without confusion. He’s not delusional about what really happened. He knows the reality of the situation and is willing to explain it. The story of the tiger is not him trying to block out his traumatic memories, it’s him trying his best to describe a completely indescribable experience.\n\nThe “coping device” interpretation kind of doesn’t hold up, in my opinion. The whole crux of the argument–Pi is lying to himself–doesn’t make sense to me really. If it really was his way of dealing with what happened, then why is the fictional account just as emotional? If he was avoiding the trauma, why does his fictionalized version of the story have violence and heartbreak and all the other emotions he must have felt in real life? I don’t think the fictional account was for Pi. That was Pi’s story for the people that wanted to hear what it was like. So he did his best to relate it. I was discussing the film with a friend, and she put it perfectly: “there is no way that he would be able to tell EITHER story if he were truly deluded.” He couldn’t have given people the option to choose which story they liked better if he was really lying to himself.\n\nTwo similar examples of this come to mind. First, the graphic novel Maus, which has an old man telling the staggering story of his experience in Auschwitz to his son. Instead of drawing human characters, the author and illustrator Art Spiegelman made the decision to draw every Jewish character as a cartoon mouse, and every German character as a cat. It’s a brilliant decision. By portraying the characters as animals, it actually makes the unthinkable atrocities that happen more relatable. You get caught up in what seems like a work of very dark fiction, only to remind yourself that it’s all true. Or the Tim O’Brien essay “How to Tell a True War Story,” in which he explains that a “true” war story isn’t about facts. It isn’t about the most accurate portrayal. O’Brien argues that a true war story is one that captures the emotions of the event. There are plenty of “true war stories” that never happened. And while some people might feel cheated that what they’re being told isn’t accurate, O’Brien argues that a true war story is one that captures the emotional truth, not the factual truth.\n\nAnd that is exactly what Pi’s story does. How could he ever possibly relate what it felt like to go through his experience to someone else unless they lived it? The only way he could possibly hope to relate the experience to someone else is to tell the emotional truth. The audience in the theater I was in gasped and shouted “nooo” when the orangutan was killed. We find out later the orangutan represented Pi’s mother. Would the audience have gasped and shouted had it been his mother all along? If we had seen the grim reality and not the fantasy? I would guess no. And that’s the whole point of the movie. The allegory is not a cheat. It’s even more effective.\n\nThink about that line I quoted up there a little while ago: “Thank you. And so it goes with God.” Arguably, it’s the most important line in the film. While a lot of people focus on the line about God, I think the “thank you,” is just important. Why is Pi thanking the author for saying the tiger story is better than the reality? Because he takes it as a compliment. He effectively expressed his emotions through fiction. That’s the mark of a good story, and a good storyteller.\n\nThe movie then relates this idea to religion. It relates back to what was said in the beginning. Pi’s father said that science and logic is all one needs. Science is about truth. Facts. But then his mother mentions that while science explains what’s all around us, religion can help describe what’s inside us. Pi is able to reconcile these seemingly differing viewpoints through his love of stories. PS I guess I should mention here I’m not particularly religious, I guess I’d call myself agnostic if the chips were down. So don’t take this as some religious nutso trying to project his own beliefs onto this movie. This is what I took away from it.\n\nBut anyway, this is the movie’s whole plot in a nutshell. Science is the real story of what happened. Whereas religion is the fictional account. “Such as it is with God.” The movie is saying that Pi’s story is like religion. They both try to make the intangible something communicable. Both religion and Pi’s story use storytelling to relate and communicate something beyond our understanding. This is also supported in Pi’s “collecting” of religions, which probably have contradictory viewpoints. He practices so many because he approaches them from the perspective of an admiring fellow storyteller, not as a firm believer in all their ideas.\n\nIf you still are a bit skeptical, check out this quote straight from the horse’s mouth! Or should I say… tiger??? Hahaha very funny joke. But no it’s from a human. The author of the book said this on the second dang page of the book: “That’s what fiction is about isn’t it, the selective transforming of reality? The twisting of it to bring out its essence?”\n\nI think this addresses a lot of peoples’ issues with the film. The ending, again, is the whole conceit. It’s not a betrayal of everything you saw before. It’s not saying that it’s cool to just accept lies to make us feel better even when we know they aren’t true. It’s demonstrating how religion uses the same tactics as a great work of fiction. To communicate emotions. To make sense of the indescribable. It’s a confirmation of the power of fiction, while still working as great fiction in its own right. In my opinion, it succeeds.\n\nQuentin Tarantino has been talking about his “Southern” movie for a while. Tarantino’s never been shy about talking about future projects or just talking in general, but all he would reveal for a while is that he’s working on a movie that combines a Spaghetti Western sensibility with a movie about slavery. When the cover page of his script leaked, the title was revealed to be Django Unchained, which some pointed out was a reference to the 1966 film Django, and its subsequent spinoffs. Okay, anyway, the full script leaked, and I figured I’d highlight some of its interesting points so people that think they’re better than me that don’t want to read a 168 pages still know what the score is. Also I should mention I’m not too well-versed in Spaghetti Westerns or really anything at all so I’d recommend not listening to me ever.\n\nThe Plot:\n\nThe basic plot is as follows: Django is freed from slavery by a German retired dentist-turned bounty hunter Dr. Schultz. You’d think that it would be the other way around, you would retire from bounty hunting to settle down as a dentist, but that is not the case in this particular film. Dr. Schultz recruits Django to track down Django’s former owners, who turn out to be wanted criminals with a bounty on their heads. Django reminisces about all the horrible things these slave owners have done to him and his fellow slaves, and kills them in cold blood once they reach their plantation. Dr. Schultz is impressed, and decides to take Django under his wing as his bounty hunting partner.\n\nAs much fun as Django is having killing horrible, pasty white people, he is more focused on tracking down his wife, Broomhilda, and freeing her from the German people that gave her that name that I’m sure gets her teased often by her fellow slaves. Maybe something like “Broomdildo” might be funny? Or like “Dustpan” or something? I’m not very good at this. Anyway, Dr. Schultz knows Django isn’t ready to undertake the mission of getting Groompillow back yet, so he trains him to become a bad ass while they hunt down outlaws.\n\nIn the film’s only perspective change, there is a flashback to when Django and Broomhilda were separated at a slave auction. Broomhilda ends up with a family that is looking for a slave companion for their pathetic son. If any agents are reading this, I think I’d be perfect for this part, please contact me soon to hammer out the details. Broomhilda’s lame boyfriend takes her out to what seems to be a resort for sad white men who force sad, beautiful black women (also known as Ponies) to be their mates. The boyfriend guy is dumb and loses Broomhilda in a game of poker to a plantation owner named Calvin Candie, who kills him, then takes Broomy to his plantation/slave suffering haven known as Candyland. Keep in mind this is set in the 1800s so that probably seemed more clever and less sinister to Candie at the time.\n\nUnder the guise of being Dr. Schultz’s slave consultant (also known as a One-Eyed Charlie [no that does not mean penis]), Django and Dr. Schultz meet Candie, and are invited to Candyland under the guise of wanting to purchase a Mandigo, which I learned were slaves trained to fight to the death while white men cheered them on and bet on the outcome.\n\nThey reach Candyland, and are treated as guests. There the audience meets the Mandigo trainer Ace Woody (no that does not mean penis), and the suck up House Slave Stephen. Stephen is the only character without a memorable name, so a helpful way to remember him is he will be played by Samuel L. Jackson, that’s something you can keep with you in your mind’s back pocket as I finish up the recap. Django is forced to keep his cool while in the presence of these jerks that stole his wife and cause suffering of his fellow slaves on a daily basis. He even takes time out of his busy schedule to beat Stephen’s ass behind closed doors for being a kiss-ass house slave that rats out other slaves and has a cushy job living in doors and waiting on the Candie family while the rest of the slaves toil in the cotton fields. This beat down, while I’m sure very satisfying for Django, only makes Stephen suspicious.\n\nDr. Schultz has Candie send Broomhilda up to his room under the pretense of wanting to speak German with her. Her and Django reunite finally, but they have to keep it on the downlow until they can get out of there. During dinner, Stephen sees Django and Broomhilda exchanging glances, and when Dr. Schultz begins to negotiate to buy Broomhilda from Candie, Stephen figures out their ruse: they are not here to buy a fighter, they are here to rescue the lady with the craziest name in all the South.\n\nStephen rats out Django, Broomhilda, and Dr. Schultz to Candie, who, instead of getting mad, decides to use the situation to his advantage. He calls Dr. Schultz out on what he was doing, and makes him pay 12,000 to free Broomhilda, even though the script makes it very clear she isn’t worth more than 500 dollars. I’m glad they didn’t have TV back then because if The Price is Right was on, it probably would be a lot less fun.\n\nAlright, at this point, all hell breaks loose, so check out the exciting conclusion at the bottom if you don’t mind spoilers.\n\nThe Characters:\n\nDjango (Jamie Foxx): Will Smith was supposedly Tarantino’s first choice for Django, but after reading the script, it’s become clear why Smith passed, especially given how hands-on he wants to be with all of his projects now. The role of Django seems like the kind that actors would be excited to take on. He’s got a clear arc to follow, he starts off understandably pensive, which means that Foxx will have to convey a lot emotion through nonverbal acting. As the movie progresses, and Django learns to trust Dr. Schultz, Foxx will get to get to flesh out Django into a fuller character through their buddy-buddy conversations. By the end of script, Django is a full-fledged badass, which I’m sure Foxx will be able to pull off.\n\nDr. Schultz (Christoph Waltz): Reading the script, it’s clear Dr. Schultz was written with Waltz in mind. The character has a similar demeanor to the Jew Hunter in that he’s smart, articulate, charming, and violent. Although the character is very similar, Dr. Schultz has a bit of naivete to him that the Jew Hunter lacked. This may be due to Dr. Schultz being new to America, and being shocked with the horrors of slavery that are laid before him. Either way, Waltz will bring the perfect balance of charm, menace, and humor that made his previous Tarantino role so memorable.\n\nCalvin Candie (Leonardo DiCaprio): It will be nice to see DiCaprio stray from his normal “brooding protagonist with a secret” kind of character that he’s played more recently. On the page, Calvin Candie is a pretty enormous asshole, so it will be interesting to see how DiCaprio chooses to portray him in order to make the character a tiny bit more sympathetic and three-dimensional. Also, it’ll be fun to watch him be an asshole I’m assuming.\n\nAce Woody (Kevin Costner): Kevin Costner seems to be one of those wildcard casting moves that Tarantino always seems to incorporate into his films. Ace Woody isn’t as big of a character as I was expecting, with only a couple scenes near the end of the film. Still, like DiCaprio, it will be interesting to see where Costner takes the character, and to see him play a villian.\n\nStephen (Samuel L. Jackson): Stephen will probably be a shock to some people. Even Wikipedia doesn’t want to believe Samuel L. Jackson will go so far against what he normally plays. They describe the character of Stephen as a “wise, proud house slave.” While I guess it’s true that Stephen is wise, and I guess he might be proud, but I wouldn’t use those adjectives to describe him. Really, Jackson is going to be playing a sniveling, cowardly, kiss-ass house slave that is remains loyal to the likes of Candie and Ace Woody despite their inhumanity to Stephen’s fellow slaves. It remains to be seen how Jackson will play it.\n\nThe Big Finale: (WARNING: Spoilers for a movie that has not begun shooting are below. I guess technically every word of this entire thing is a spoiler, but if you want to keep this movie a surprise, you can stop reading now because this part will definitely be a surprise.)\n\nOkay, so Dr. Schultz buys Broomhilda, but Candie taunts him by refusing to let them leave until they shake hands and seal the deal. Dr. Schultz can’t take it anymore, so as he reaches to shake Candie’s hand, a gun slides out of his sleeve Travis Bickle style, and he shoots Candie in the heart. Ace Woody then shoots Dr. Schultz in the head, which causes it to promptly explode. Django gets knocked out.\n\nHe wakes up stripped nude, and hanging upside-down from a rope. Here’s where it gets interesting, and here is where you realize why Will Smith didn’t take the role. Ace Woody enters, and begins to monologue about how Django and Dr. Schultz ruined his slave trading livelihood. He is so upset, he grabs a handful of Django’s genitals, and moves to cut off his testicles. Stephen mercifully enters right before the snipping begins and says they have other plans for Django.\n\nOnce Ace Woody leaves, Stephen takes this opportunity to take his turn in monologuing and grabbing Django’s nuts as well. He mercifully lets go off Django’s nuts, tortures him briefly, then sends him on his way to work on a chain gang smashing rocks until he dies a very slow death from fatigue.\n\nOn his way to the chain gang, Django is able to convince some Australian fellows to release him, promising them that they will get a large bounty that is supposedly placed on the folks back at the plantation’s head. The dopey Australians buy it, and release him. Django kills them, then rides back to Candyland.\n\nFinally, Django is ready for the final showdown with the remaining people at Candyland. He lines up everyone there that has wronged him, including Mrs. Candie, Stephen, and Ace Woody, and hands them all guns in holsters. Six bad guys all stand facing Django in a showdown. I guess this could technically be called a Mexican Standoff–one of Tarantino’s staples–but I don’t think even the root’nest toot’nest gunslinging Mexican would touch 6 to 1 odds.\n\nAs soon as one of them reaches for their gun, Django uses his quick-draw skills learned from Dr. Schultz to shoot all 6 of them with his revolver before any of them know what hit them. They slump to the ground in pain. Django grabs some dynamite, and throws it among the wounded. He shoots the dynamite and it blows everyone to pieces, and he rides off with Broomhilda to make babies and give them weird names. The End.\n\nMy View on the Structure/Tone:\n\nWhile Tarantino does do rewrites as the he’s shooting, from I’ve gathered reading the Inglourious Basterds script is that it’s mostly tweaks and editing, and once he’s got the final draft of the script and it’s been faxed out to everybody in LA, that’s pretty much what the movie will be, so I’m assuming the basic plot I’ve outlined won’t change, but I don’t know for sure. Anyway, the script is more basic than most of other Tarantino’s work. For one, it’s linear other than the occasional flashback, and other than a small section, it is told entirely from the perspective of Django. It’s like that movie Unstoppable, but instead of a train, it’s a freed slave, and instead of stopping the train, the goal is to get reunite with his wife and hopefully kill everyone if he can. What I’m saying is, unlike some Tarantino movies, the script does not have many asides, or a lot of off-the-cuff conversations. Not that I have a problem with any of those things. What I’m saying is, the script is full of no-nonsense characters that have no tolerance for nonsense.\n\nWhile I’m not too knowledgeable about Spaghetti Westerns, I have to say a good portion of the script reminded me of a buddy cop movie: a genre of which I am very knowledgeable, and can prove my knowledge with a spot on Chris Tucker and Jackie Chan impression. Oh don’t believe me? Check this out. “Jackie: Please, I don’t want trouble. Chris: EEEE!!” But seriously, I like buddy cop movies, and Django Unchained has all the staples. Once Django and Dr. Schultz team up to become a bounty hunting duo. It’s a fish out of water story, complete with training montages, lessons being learned on both sides, and plenty of fun friendship moments between the partners.\n\nThe script also reminded me of the niche horror genre that existed in the seventies that included films such as The Hills Have Eyes, I Spit On Your Grave, The Last House On the Left, and others. They all seemed to follow the formula of subjecting the main character (and the audience to a lesser extent) to horrible violence in the first half, and then releasing that tension with the cathartic killing of all those involved. Django Unchained, unlike many of these movies, seems to have more going for it, and there are a variety of emotions, including a lot of humorous scenes, some romance, and tension. However, it still does follow Django as he relives the horrors of slavery, which builds until finally the anger he and the audience shares is released as he kills everyone and rides off with his bride.\n\nAnother thing that stands out is the fact that this movie is set before there was any type of popular culture in America, which means no radio, no television, no movies, no pop songs from the ‘60s, and no old cereal boxes, which all happen to be some of Tarantino’s favorite things. However, like my terrible Unstoppable analogy implied, this movie doesn’t really slow down for things like pop culture, it’s all about pushing the film forward, making you hate the people Django hates, and keeping the story going until the final confrontation. You don’t remember a scene in Unstoppable where the train takes a break do you? Denzel Washington and Chris Pine don’t hop out of the locomotive for a minute to grab lunch do they? Right. They don’t. The analogy stands.\n\nAs expected with Tarantino, the script really pulls no punches in showing violence or any other sort of inhumanity that goes along with slavery. We see men beaten to death, ripped apart by dogs, shot in many number of ways, and there is plenty of whipping and other forms of slave torture. While Inglourious Basterds presented a more complex look on Nazis and the Third Reich, making you feel bad for being like Hitler and getting excited over seeing a film about your county’s enemy getting slaughtered. As far as I remember, though, in Django Unchained, if the character owns slaves, they are irredeemable pieces of shit. Not to seem like I am criticizing the script for that however, or trying to defend slave owners. Unlike World War II, there hasn’t been a great deal of movies about slavery in the United States, and it still remains a regrettable part of the country’s not-so-distant memory.\n\nThis movie isn’t about the complexities of slave owning, or how slaves allowed a young America to prosper through free labor, it is about the horrors that went on that still aren’t really talked about. Before reading, I think the most graphic depiction of slavery I had seen was Amistad, which covered some of the same ground as Django Unchained, such as the brutal whippings that went on, or the carefree mass murder that slave owners got away with. The script deals with other aspects, however, that I had no idea about, such as people owning “Ponies,” basically sex slaves. Or, the brutal idea of Mandigo fighting, where slaves were forced to fight to the death for the enjoyment of sadistic slave owners. In addition, unlike current movies about slavery that I’ve seen, Django Unchained presents these under the pretense of being a Western-style action movie, with gunslinging and cool music. It’s actually labeled that, by the way, the stage directions read “CUE cool MUSIC” during the film’s climax.\n\nThat’s not to say the script does not have flaws, especially with some of the secondary characters, and the simple plot that seem a tad more one-dimensional than Tarantino normally goes for. The script doesn’t really have as many “oh shit” type twists and turns that characterize movies like Pulp Fiction and Inglourious Basterds, but that might just be the nature of Tarantino being focused on a single protagonist’s goal, and staying true to the format of a Spaghetti Western’s revenge plot. There are a few overdone characters strewn about, including Broomhilda’s owner, a momma’s boy manchild, and Candie’s wife, who doesn’t have much of a role other than to play the Southern Belle. Of course, the main characters all seem more complex, and maybe these smaller parts just need good character actors to flesh them out. It’s too early on, it’s hard to say for sure.\n\nOverall, it seems like this script is going to rely on casting and acting much more than many other Tarantino scripts. Also, the return to the over-the-top violence and revenge seen in the likes of Kill Bill will most likely be a hit with crowds, especially as a cathartic release in response to the torture and mutilation that goes on in the beginning of the movie.\n\nThe ticket or rental price will be worth seeing how the ending plays out. Will they show Kevin Costner and Samuel L. Jackson doing what the script describes, or will it just be implied? Only time will tell."
