        "text": "Horror movies have always had a unique appeal for queer audiences. Themes of morality and isolation and otherness. And, of course, the camp factor.\n\nCOUNTRY QUEEN: Texas native Maren Morris partners with GLAAD to support LGBTQ+ youth\n\n\"Hellraiser,\" the pleasure-and-pain franchise that gave birth to Pinhead, has long been part of that catalog. The original film is an adaptation of \"The Hellbound Heart\" and was written and directed by openly gay horror master Clive Barker. He has said the underground gay BDSM scene was a huge influence.\n\nThe new take on \"Hellraiser,\" streaming now on Hulu, is a full-on celebration of LGBTQ+ talent.\n\nTrans actress Jamie Clayton takes on the pivotal role of Pinhead, imbuing the character with a darkly alluring appeal. And that voice. You can't help but be drawn in.\n\n\"I never thought that in a million years I would book this,\" she told ABC Audio.\n\nAnother bit of trivia: Trans drag queen Gottmik from \"RuPaul's Drag Race\" auditioned for the role, too.\n\nBrandon Flynn, the openly gay actor who starred in \"13 Reasons Why\" and \"Ratched,\" plays Matt, the main character's overprotective brother. Matt is in a relationship with Colin, played by the openly gay Adam Faison.\n\n\"It's so nice to just be able to live and not be coded in metaphor. It's nice to be able to now just fully live and then also don't have to explain why we are, who we are, why we're in this world. We're just in it,\" Faison told slashfilm.com about his and Flynn's characters.\n\nThe cast also includes \"Love, Simon\" star Drew Starkey; Goran Visnjic, who played the late Christopher Plummer's younger lover in the film \"Beginnings\" and queer actor Zachary Hing as one of the Cenobites who terrorize the film's human characters."
