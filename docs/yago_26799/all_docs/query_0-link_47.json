        "text": "The hell raiser film series is a series of nine films that discusses the rise of the evil pinhead and his cenobite minions. Hell raiser is brought to us by the mind of Clive Barker who authored the Hellbound heart in 1984....The very book that would influence the nine hell raiser films.\n\nAs the story goes in the film series a puzzle ( played by Doug Bradly in the first 7 films)was created In 18th century France, by a team of bloodthirsty satanists who hired a Philip LeMarchand to create the Lament Configuration which would later bring us Pinhead and other Cenobite ...It makes one wonder if the hell raiser character was influenced by the worst parts of the French revolution the very types of Frenchman that may have been hard-core atheist /Satanist.\n\nThe Lament configuration was created by the 18th century Frenchmen Philip LeMarchand Who then gave this creation to two French Satanists who used the puzzle to summon a portal between hell and earth Ushering in The rise of pinhead and his cenobite minions. This is mostly explained in the fourth film of the Hellraiser film series.\n\nPinhead and his cenobite minions are drawn by pleasure and pain. They seek to take peoples souls And to bring souls to hell for all of eternity. A constant plot line with all the films are the main protagonist fighting their own Temptations and insecurities and pinhead taking advantage of those insecurities.\n\n\"The Hellbound Heart is a horror novella by Clive Barker that was the basis for the 1987 movie Hellraiser. It was originally published in November 1986 by Dark Harvest in the third volume of their Night Visions anthology series, but was re-released as a stand-alone title by Harper Collins in 1988 after the success of the movie, along with an audiobook recorded by Clive Barker and published by Audioworks. It retains the gory, visceral style that Barker introduced in his series of collected short stories The Books of Blood. The story focuses on a mystical Puzzle Box (Lemarchand Configuration) and the horror it wreaks on a family which is unfortunate enough to come across it.\"\n\nThe Hellbound Heart\n\nThe Hellbound Heart is a horror novella by Clive Barker that was the basis for the 1987 movie Hellraiser. It was originally published in November 1986 by Dark Harvest in the third volume of their Night Visions anthology series, but was re-released as a stand-alone title by Harper Collins in 1988...\n\nWHAT ARE THE CENOBITES?\n\nThe Cenobites first appeared in Clive Barker's 1986 novella The Hellbound Heart. The book tells the story of a hedonistic creep by the name of Frank Cotton, who is constantly looking for the next level of sensual exploration, no matter how depraved. Frank utilizes a puzzle box known as the Lemarchand Configuration, to open a portal to an extra-dimensional realm where the Cenobites reside in the hopes to experience the greatest sensual stimulant possible. Of course, Frank gets more than what he bargained for and is shown a world of terror, humiliation and torture.\"\n\n\"In in the original text, the Cenobites are unnamed and are described as asexual beings who have been marred and modified so horribly, they bear little resemblance to the human form.\"\n\nWHO IS PINHEAD?\n\n\"Later Hellraiser films would expand on the character's background and history. Before becoming the servant of Leviathan, the deity who thrives on the pain and suffering of others and employs the Cenobites to retrieve fresh victims, Pinhead was a World War I Captain man named Elliott Spencer, who befell a similar fate as Frank Cotton after solving Lemarchand Configuration. The grid across Pinhead's with a nail hammered into each intersection is an outlandish character design that has captured the imagination of fans and creators for the last three decades.\"\n\nWHO ARE THE OTHER CENOBITES?\n\n\"While Pinhead might be the most recognizable Cenobite, he is by no means the only one to have some unique defining characteristics. In Hellraiserwe also meet Chatterer, Butterball, and The Female, who are all part of Pinhead's Gash. And much like Pinhead, their main defining characteristics are pretty much spelled out in their names.\"\n\nWhat are folks thoughts on the hell raiser film series? Which cenobite was the most interesting to you? What do you take away from the hell raiser film series.\n\nPersonally I think the series is not just about good versus evil. While The first few films give us a leading protagonist in the actress Ashley Laurence. Laurence plays Kirsty Cotton The young .... who plays the \"good guy\" And does what she can to try and send pinhead back to hell. But otoh the 5th hell raiser features a lead character played by Craig Sheffer. Sheffer Plays a detective with a sordid past And throughout the fifth film pinhead is able to get into the head of the detective getting the detective to realize his faults in life.\n\nSo throughout the film series pinhead faces off against both good and bad trying to send souls into hell for eternity.\n\nSome of the films were a little bit corny one could say, but the first few, and the fifth film we're very good in my opinion. The fifth hell raiser film was directed by Scott Derrickson who in the modern era directed big budget films such as Doctor Strange, Produced at a much higher budget then the relatively small $2 million budget of hell raiser five.\n\nTo me the hell raiser film series reminds of the stories throughout the middle and post Middle Ages.... discussing A Christian version of hell which shows us the minions of hell trying to affect the lives of good and bad humans on earth. The constant themes being The derivation of pleasure via pain as well as more normal Temptations such as ..., money and power.\n\nAttachments\n\n1608515101109.jpeg\n\nThis post will discuss hell raiser 4. This was the final hell raiser film to be given a theatrical release, the rest of the hell raiser films would go direct to video. What's interesting about hell raiser 4 is this was the highest grossing film of the series and the plot involves hell raiser going into space. But also a good portion of the story discusses the origins of pinhead going back to 18th century France.\n\n\"Playing out like a Hellraiser anthology film, Bloodline's first story is set in 18th century France, where we meet box creator Philip LeMarchand. A master toymaker, LeMarchand is hired by an evil magician to build the iconic box, having no idea what it's going to be used for. As it turns out, the madman is looking to open a portal to Hell, and he does just that – giving rise to the very first Cenobite, a female named Angelique.\n\nWe eventually jump forward to 1996, which was present day at the time of the film's release. Angelique travels to New York in an effort to locate John Merchant, an engineer with family ties to LeMarchand. Driven by supernatural forces, Merchant is compelled to build a skyscraper that is literally a massive puzzle box, and Angelique – along with Pinhead – intends to use it as a much bigger portal between Hell and the real world.\n\nThe final story, which is essentially the wraparound segment, is set on a space station in the year 2127. There we meet Paul Merchant, another distant relative of LeMarchand's who is continuing his family's work. Merchant willingly summons Pinhead and his Cenobites aboard the ship, which happens to be modeled after the puzzle box, and he plans on blowing the whole thing up once they arrive – ending his family's nightmare once and for all.\"\n\nUnderrated Sequels – ‘Hellraiser: Bloodline’\n\nIn Hell… everyone can hear you scream. It’s often said that outer space is where horror franchises go to die, and the film that’s typically cited as evidence of that statement is of course Jason X. But the Friday the 13th franchise wasn’t the only one to take a rocket ship to the stars (I’m...\n\nPhillipe Lemarchand\n\n\"He is the man who created the Lament Configuration, but had no intention to make it do what it does, this was done by a man with dark magic,\"\n\nLemarchand Family\n\nThe Lemarchand family is a cursed family seen throughout the Hellraiser franchise, first seen in Hellraiser: Bloodline. He is the man who created the Lament Configuration, but had no intention to make it do what it does, this was done by a man with dark magic, while trying to stop it, Phillipe..."
