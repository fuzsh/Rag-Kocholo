        "text": "Clive Barker. The name needs little or no introduction, at least amongst serious purveyors of the fantastique. Barker exploded onto the America literary market some 15 years ago with his exotic, viscerally gripping three volume set of the Books of Blood.\n\nBarker next subjected the American movie going public to his inter-dementia flesh reconfigurations in the now classic horror film Hellraiser. While those two works would have been enough to quell most artist's desires, Barker has continued to crank out imaginative fiction, work on films, delve into the world of art (both sketches and paintings), and erotica.\n\nWhen I casually referred to Clive as a renaissance man, he laughed, then immediately remarked how that moniker was rather pretentious. Few men who have mastered as many of the arts as Clive Barker would be so humble.\n\nWhat follows is Part 1 of a 2-part interview with Clive Barker, the man whom Stephen King once referred to as 'the future of horror.' While that phrase may still ring with some truth, Clive also reveals himself to be more than just a creator of horror fiction, but rather a master of the fantastique.\n\nRead on...\n\nIGN For Men: How did you initially fall into the director's chair? I mean the only other modern day, ultra popular author I can think of who has written and directed at least three films is Michael...\n\nClive Barker: Michael Crichton, right. Crichton, did he do three movies?\n\nIGN For Men: Actually more than three...there's Coma, which was based on Robin Cook's book, but Crichton wrote the screenplay and directed the film...\n\nClive Barker: Right, he did Coma, he did The Great Train Robbery with Sean Connery, and did he also do Looker?\n\nIGN For Men: Yeah, he wrote and directed Looker, too, as well as Runaway, and Westworld.\n\nClive Barker: Well I fell into it, to be perfectly honest, as an act of self-defense [laughs]. I had so disliked the early movies, the two movies--Transmutations and Rawhead Rex. I hated them so much and that was a time--this was the middle-to-late '80s--when the video revolution was happening and there were a lot of people making a lot of really low-budget horror movies. And it was relatively easy to get somebody to throw a modest amount of money at you to make a picture. I think it was actually easier than it is now.\n\nIGN For Men: Really?\n\nClive Barker: Yes, because firstly there was a sense that the video revolution was going to be huge and make people $%&*loads of money, which, of course, turned out to be true. Second, there were a lot of people like Cronenberg and the like making off, offbeat pictures. I say a lot, there weren't a lot, but there were some that were making really offbeat horror movies which were really very commercial. You know, Scanners and The Brood. That was toward the end of David's really successful horror-horror movie making, as opposed to his later things which have become something, arguably more sophisticated....\n\nIGN For Men:...and less definable as horror films.\n\nClive Barker: Right! And he was a great model for me. Here was a guy who was coming out of Canada making movies, which were working for the American market. And he was making movies, which he was writing, obviously, which were very particularly him. I mean nobody would mistake a Cronenberg movie for anything but a Cronenberg movie. And that was very inspiring to me. He also had come out of a desire, I mean he'd originally wanted to be a novelist. So he had and has a literary take on things. So I met up with a friend who said 'I want to be a producer.' And I said 'Well, you know, I want to be a director.' It was a room full of wannabes. And we were quite nicely placed. It was a very cheap movie, 900,000 dollars, that first Hellraiser picture. I had written the script on spec, so there was no money against the script. We came over here, flew out to LA on our own money and sat with a few people and said 'You know, here's a movie which we can make for you and deliver for you very cheaply. And you know what? If it doesn't work for you theatrically, you're only spending 900,000 dollars on it anyway, you'll have a good video life and you'll make your money back that way.' And...\n\nIGN For Men: $900,000? By today's standards that far less than a piss in the bucket.\n\nClive Barker: Absolutely, a tiny amount of money. I think for the people who were funding the thing it seemed like a no lose situation, which fiscally I'm sure it was. As it turned out, about halfway through shooting this thing they sort of began to look at the dailies and began to think 'Hmmm, maybe there's more here than meets the eye. Maybe we do have a theatrical life for this. Maybe we do have something that we can sell. Maybe we even have something which we can spin out into a franchise.' Nightmare on Elm Street was doing well at that point...\n\nIGN For Men: Plus you were coming off the tail end of the Halloween's and the Friday the 13th's.\n\nClive Barker: Exactly. All in all, you know, the stars were aligned. I think that's the best way of putting it. And the secret weapon, and it was so secret even I didn't know we had it, was Pinhead. It was this image that when people saw it on posters and in trailers and things, people really loved it. They responded to it even though they didn't know anything about the movie. That was, to some extent, a fluke. I mean I designed something, which caught people's imaginations. Everything just seemed to come together. It was a small company, they put a lot of muscle behind the selling of it and they saw a huge return on it.\n\nIGN For Men: At that point did you want to be a director, as opposed to being known primarily as an author? I mean looking at your career thus far, you've sort of been a jack-of-all-trades, doing theater, films, literature, art...\n\nClive Barker: I think that's how I envisaged myself and still envisage myself. I'd like to be known as a guy who plays. You know, plays in painting, plays in drawing, plays in writing, plays in filmmaking...\n\nIGN For Men: The proverbial renaissance man, eh?\n\nClive Barker: That would be the pretentious end of it. The less pretentious rendering would be a guy who just simply wants to have a go at everything, you know?\n\nIGN For Men: And make a living off it...\n\nClive Barker: And make a living off it, right. And frankly, I'll always be going to my job, whatever my job is, with a sense that there's something new to be done, something new to be discovered. I have a very low boredom threshold. I like to be doing something, which sort of challenges me in terms of...not just in terms of material. Obviously moving through genres has been a challenge. You know, moving from horror into fantasy and from fantasy to children's stuff and erotic stuff and so on. I've always tried to keep my head, my imagination challenged that way. But also in terms of learning new trades. Filmmaking was something that I was obliged to learn while doing it. And that was fun. I think we all like to learn new stuff. And the only part of the filmmaking process that I really just cannot abide is the developmental process. I don't know a single writer/director in this town who would tell you they like development. So that's pretty much the story there.\n\nIGN For Men: Since you brought up the shifting from genre to genre, I re-watched Lord of Illusions the other night and there's that one scene where Swann says something to the effect of 'It's important to distract people from their banality for a few minutes.' What Swann is talking about is essentially providing escapism. But then I read in the introduction of your new book, The Essential Clive Barker and you say '...the primary impulse behind such creations is not escapism. That implies a kind of cowardice...'\n\nClive Barker: Well I think the fact about Swann is that in that speech he's in denial. That's the speech in the car when he's talking to Harry and he's in denial about the very thing that he's going to face, which is the fact that he hasn't been playing all this time. He's actually been dealing with something very real. The most honest things I've ever said about my craft, I suppose, and about my motivation, about my processes, are in that introduction. And I do believe that I have gone through sort of cycles, if you will, about why I do what I do. When there are very dark times in one's life they think you go to fiction very often to escape. There's no question that I have fled into the pages of fictions, which have provided a much simpler vision of life than the one I'm presently experiencing. Do you see what I mean?\n\nIGN For Men: Oh yeah. I think we're all guilty of that.\n\nClive Barker: Right. But then there are also times when I have gone, paradoxically, to those same books for a way to engage with issues which are represented metaphorically in those fictions. Ray Bradbury, Peter Pan, all kinds of fantastic worlds have provided me--The Tempest, Midsummer Night's Dream--me with ways to better understand my own life in certain circumstances...\n\nIGN For Men: In a sense you would have been using these fictions in sort of an Aesop's Fables kind of way, to break it down into the most simplest of terms.\n\nClive Barker: Uh, right. But that might be too simple. What I would prefer to say is just as Freud went looking for a means to describe the most complex and sophisticated of psychological processes, he goes to myth. He goes to Oedipus. He goes to stories, which have been part of the culture for thousands of years, and finds in them the raw material to explain and illuminate incredibly sophisticated internal processes. So I think we can go to fantasy, to folklore, to science fiction, and find in the images that fairy tale or folklore or you know, any piece of fantastic fiction, find those images and forms which can help us illuminate ourselves. And that's the most important part, that's what this business of the fantastic is really about. It's not easy reading. It's not easy writing. And I think the people who don't understand it, the people who criticize it, the people who dismiss it, very often do so, not because they're actually in their heart of hearts feeling superior to it, but because they're actually intimidated by it.\n\nIGN For Men: Almost like that line from Nightbreed where the mist woman from Midian says something to the effect of 'We often kill that which we envy.'\n\nClive Barker: Right. I also try to describe in the introduction [to The Essential Clive Barker] about my Shakespearean teacher who had such a fear, such contempt for fantastic writing But when I began to sort of really study it in hindsight, study that fear, it seemed to me that a lot of it was to do with the fact that she was intimidated by it.\n\nIGN For Men: Which is ironic considering that some of Shakespeare's best known work dealt with the fantastic.\n\nClive Barker: Right. But I would go further than that Spence. I would say that the paradox of that is even his historical plays contained ghosts. So there is a fantastic element even in plays like Richard the III, which has got a ghost scene in it. The modern moment is one which values naturalism and realism, perhaps more highly than ever in history. And I don't necessarily see that as a strength. I think in ghettoizing the fantastic, in driving it, if you will, to the limits of the academic world, to the limits of the critical world, so it's very hard to find a really smart review of a fantastic novel in the pages of the New York Times or the LA Times; in ghettoizing it, actually what we are doing is throwing to the outer reaches of our culture what is in fact, in truth, central [to it].\n\nIGN For Men: What do you mean by ghettoizing the fantastic?\n\nClive Barker: What I mean is if you go into Barnes & Noble what you will find is a number of little neighborhoods...\n\nIGN For Men: Right, the subdivisions of genres...\n\nClive Barker: The divisions. And when you're dead [laughs] you get to leave the ghetto and you get to join the main part of the city. So Edgar Allen Poe will now be under Literature under 'P.'\n\nIGN For Men: Well that's pretty much true of all the old school arts; painting and theater. It's like you're more famous when you're dead.\n\nClive Barker: Right, right, right. Well, it's not even a question of fame, so much as it is about...I want to preach to the unconverted. I don't want to feel as though the only people who will read my stuff are people who already get it. I want to be able to take--my tongue is slightly in my cheek when I say this, but not too deeply--I'd like to take the people whose usual reading is Danielle Steel or Tom Clancy and bring them into a world in which the fantastic is presented as an alternative reality. And persuade them that there is some healing, transformative truth in that fiction. And it's hard to get to the readers of Danielle Steel and Tom Clancy when you're hidden away in the corner of bookstore under 'Horror.'\n\nIGN For Men: Which we all know is usually regarded as the stepchild of modern fiction.\n\nClive Barker: Right.\n\nEND OF PART 1\n\n.....Check back on Monday evening, December 20 for Part 2, where Clive talks about Ray Bradbury, his new book, The Essential Clive Barker, what he's working on next, and reveals yet more intimate details of the fantastique.\n\nBe sure and read"
