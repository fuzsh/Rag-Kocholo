        "text": "It is the time of year again to discuss all things spooky and horror. This year for Halloween, I wanted to challenge myself to explore something within the genre I had never done. I pride myself on being able to say that I've seen all that Chucky, Freddy, Leatherface, Ghostface and Michael have to offer. But beyond the staples of these franchises exists something a bit twisted and borderline sensual, a creation that could come from none other than Clive Barker. I'm talking of course about Hellraiser, Pinhead, the Lament configuration, and the cenobites. Given that this is my first time through the entire franchise, here is my final diagnosis of the top 10 movies of the Hellraiser franchise.\n\n10. Revelations, Part IX\n\nIf you are familiar with this franchise, then chances are, this first entry is no surprise. This is the first film without Doug Bradley, the actor behind the franchise's antagonist for the first 8 films. Seeing a new actor take up the pins was inevitable at some point in time, though this is a poor excuse for an antagonist. Stephen Smith Collins is far from the only thing wrong with this movie. When your purpose to make a movie is simply retain rights, you might wanna check your intentions for why you make movies in the first place. One part found footage, found way too late. One part reboot. To call this movie a mess would be an insult to messes everywhere.\n\n9. Inferno, Part V\n\nMuch like Revelations, Inferno marks a significant change in approach to the characters of the franchise. The fifth entry is the first film within the direct to video era of Pinhead. While Dimension continues to work on his triumphant return to the silver screen, we are left with empty approaches to these characters. Co-written and directed by Scott Derrickson, the man behind Doctor Strange, comes a movie that tells the story of a dirty cop trying to cover up a murder. Oh yeah, this is a Hellraiser movie. So we have to have the Lament configuration and the cenobites. The mythology aspect feels like an afterthought for this dry entry with a pathetic excuse for acting and writing. Hard to believe this guy went on to make the Sorcerer Supreme.\n\n8. Bloodline, Part IV\n\nThe last time the cenobites have ever seen the lights of the projector is weird. It's a terrible sign when your director is \"Alan Smithee\", which basically means the director didn't want to take credit. From what I've learned about the film, there are three different directors who took three very different approaches to this movie. This movie is key for mythology building because it explores the origins of the Lament configuration. Outside of that, the narrative explores life in the 1700s, 1990s and 2040s. Three timelines cast a confusing end result that shows its behind the scenes drama on screen.\n\n7. Hellseeker, Part VI\n\nDean Winters, who is most known currently for playing the Mayhem guy from those All-State commercials, stars in the sixth entry. Honestly in some regards this movie feels like it copies off the homework of Christopher Nolan's debut with Memento. Winters stars as a guy who is trying to figure out what's wrong with him and what happened to his wife. An alluring approach to the franchise that interestingly intertwines Pinhead. Not to mention it brings back Hellraiser and Hellbound star, Ashley Laurence. What an odd time to return to the franchise.\n\n6. Deader, Part VII\n\nI love the idea of cults revolving around an icon like Pinhead. Much like its predecessor, here you have a decent idea with mediocre delivery. Deader feels much like Flatliners with a Hellraiser twist. It's entertaining, yet forgettable.\n\n5. Hellworld, Part VIII\n\nThis one is probably one of the more controversial placements within this list. A cast which features a very young Henry Cavill and Katherine Wennick; this entry saw Pinhead and cenobites existing as a video game franchise with a hardcore fanbase. This is the closest the franchise has ever seen to a slasher. As well as New Nightmare or Scream with their meta approach to the genre. Oh yeah, did I mention that this one is campy as they come. I love every moment of it.\n\n4. Hellbound, Part II\n\nYet another controversial place on this list. I recognize that this film is important to the lore, yet outside of that, it offers little to nothing for me, especially considering this is the first sequel to the groundbreaking film that is Hellraiser. I adore the exploration of ideas that this one explores through the world of Hell, the cenobites, personal demons, and even the Doctor becoming a cenobite himself. The Snow White-Evil Witch dynamic is admirable but the story loses its grandness.\n\n3. Judgment, Part X\n\nI feel like I’m on a roll when it comes to unpopular opinions and the Hellraiser franchise. Following the debacle of Revelations in 2011, this movie originally found life as a passion project from Gary Turnercliffe. He actually did end up writing and directing this one when they finally agreed to make another movie that wasn’t a Hollywood reboot. This one follows the sequel path of the Hellraiser films past Inferno but offers up new mythological elements. This is the first time we are seeing the judgment and element of angelic warfare.\n\n2. Hell on Earth, Part III\n\nWhile Bloodline literally went to space and let’s face it, how do you get bigger than space? Well before the franchise went to space they approached the action movie genre; while remaining faithful to the foundation of the first two entries. This film features Pinhead as you’ve never seen him before or since. An absolute blast and without a doubt has one of my favorite death scenes in all of the horror genre. Yes, I’m talking about that club scene.\n\n1. Hellraiser\n\nSometimes when it comes to franchises you can outdo the film that started it all. That’s not the case here. Clive Barker, in his directorial debut, showcases a twisted love story wrapped into a mythological tale. It’s hard to describe really why this one works so well. The slow burn storytelling approach, the cinematic score, and marvelous practice effects make this one of the best horror movies of the 1980s."
