        "text": "Clive on Hellraiser X : Judgment\n\nOops. We've drawn a complete blank on meaningful comment from Clive - or even passing reference ! All help gratefully received.\n\n...other comments\n\n...Gary Tunnicliffe has played a part in the Hellraiser movies for many years and has now taken writing and directing duties on the latest sequel, Hellraiser: Judgment, for Dimension Films. With the role of Pinhead being played by Paul T. Taylor, (and without involvement from Clive), the sequel was released in 2018 following a three week shoot in Oklahoma City in 2017.\n\nThe plot revolves around Detectives Sean and David Carter, seeking a gruesome serial killer who is terrorizing the city. Joining forces with Detective Christine Egerton, they dig deeper into a spiraling maze of horror that may not be of this world and undergo a final accounting of their souls by creatures of the underworld. These denizens of hell include The Auditor, The Assessor and a Jury of faceless, naked women...\n\nHeather Langenkamp: \"I actually have an opportunity, I'm going to play a small part in Hellraiser, the new Hellraiser. I have to say - yeah, I'm so excited about it - I go next week to do the shooting...\n\n\"I have to say that this script is amazing and that's why I took the part, it's something that I just found incredible when I read it.\n\n\"It's Gary Tunnicliffe who did all the makeup for all these years. They've given him the opportunity to direct the movie, so, I think it's going to be pretty outstanding.\"\n\nHeather Langenkamp Interview; New Hellraiser Movie Imminent\n\nBy [ ], Scare Tissue, YouTube, 16 February 2016\n\nGary Tunnicliffe: \"I was devastated to not be able to direct [previous Hellraiser sequel,] Revelations and to see the script whittled down and shot in a way that I would not have done... It was tough to see something I created altered and served up in a way that I was not a fan of in the end, although I think people and the fans have been able to see some evidence of what 'may have been' had there been more time, money, etc. This time around, it was vital that I get into the director's chair and I have to thank Joel Soisson, Mike Leahy and the folks at Dimension Films for giving me this opportunity and trusting me with what is a fairly daring and intimidating script and vision this time around.\n\n\"This is not a simple recycling of the Hellraiser formula; this is a film that will boast some of the strangest, most bizarre, horrific and thought provoking sequences ever seen in a horror film.\n\n\"I was thrilled and excited to call Doug and let him know I was writing and directing Hellraiser: Judgment, I considered Pinhead HIS role and I was looking forward to working with him and bringing him back to the fans. Legally, we needed a simple non-disclosure agreement signed (very much commonplace now with production companies) but he immediately balked... I was stunned... I wrote to him saying I was sorry he felt that way and the next day the search for a new Pinhead began.\n\n\"A few weeks later, we found him: a classically trained stage and film actor who brings a great physical presence and more than a hint of Peter Cushing and Ralph Fiennes. I can't wait to get him bound in leather, gridded up and in front of the camera and on screens!\n\n\"The film isn't a re-hashing of an old script (as some lesser-informed sites are assuming), nor was it rushed into production. It's a completely original piece and so far it's looking pretty amazing.\"\n\nDirector Gary Tunnicliffe Talks Hellraiser' Sequel!\n\nBy Ken W. Hanley, Fangoria.com, 18 February 2016\n\nPaul T. Taylor: \"The script is very reflective of the early works of Clive Barker, and I don't mean just The Hellbound Heart, which is what it was based on. Books like Books of Blood and his early works. I think that when Gary was writing the script - he's sort of a Clive Barker scholar I guess, I think he reads or has read anything that Clive has ever written because he absolutely loves Clive Barker and his work - so when he wrote the script it really had the flavor of Barker's world that was created in the first film...\n\n\"On the set, the aesthetics that drove the work were the Davids', and those being Cronenberg, Lynch and Fincher. That was Gary's inspiration for the aesthetics of the movie. And some people who have seen it say that it feels like The Cell and Seven mixed with Hellraiser.\n\nA Ton Of Hellraiser: Judgment Info Straight From Pinhead Himself!\n\nBy Mike Sprague and Jimmy O, JoBlo.com, 14 April 2017\n\nDoug Bradley: \"I gather word is beginning to spread about the new Hellraiser movie which is, apparently, already shooting...\n\n\"First I heard about this new film was around Christmas in a phone call from Gary Tunnicliffe, who was my make-up artist on Bloodline through Hellworld. Gary, you may recall, also wrote the screenplay for Revelations. He has written and is directing this new effort. I can also assert, contrary to some rumours I've already seen, that Clive Barker is not involved with this in any way, shape or form.\n\n\"Gary said he would send me a copy of the script when he had completed a second draft, but before I could be allowed to set eyes on the precious document, I was required to sign a gagging order. This was a three page document preventing me from talking about the script 'in restrooms', 'on elevators', 'in restaurants' or 'in cellular telephone conversations which may be overheard'. There was also dark reference to 'people talking out of turn at conventions'. I read this thing in disbelief, and informed Gary I would not be signing it.\n\n\"And that's that. Clearly, I am deemed too much of a security risk to be allowed to read a Hellraiser script. People are starving to death in Syria and they're worried about me talking about a Hellraiser movie? Get a fucking grip. Can you say 'sense of proportion'?\n\n\"Anyway, story short: a new movie is happening and I have nothing do with it. I was unable to make a decision about it because I was not allowed to read the script, unlike Revelations where I made a conscious decision not to do the movie based on the motives for making it and the poor quality of the script.\n\n\"And that's everything.\"\n\nFacebook post\n\nBy Doug Bradley, Facebook post, 18 February 2016\n\nGary Tunnicliffe: \"Judgment was always a Hellraiser project (concept), but I didn't think I would have a shot at directing a Hellraiser movie, so I removed the Hellraiser elements and tried to get Judgment made independently. I met with several producers but they found the material so outlandish and disturbing they always balked... Some friends suggested I try Kickstarter... it didn't sit well with me, so I decided to pull it. I only ever had a pitch, no script was ever written.\n\n\"Judgment IS a rights issue movie, but has been made with the sensibilities and input given to a regular budgeted Dimension feature. The executives (all the way to the very TOP of Dimension) and producers involved didn't just say, 'Bang this out'; there was an intense development stage, several re-writes and amazing input and guidance on casting, etc. Initially I pitched two concepts: Hellraiser: Judgment and a second idea called Hellraiser: Enter Darkness (I still love that title!). The latter of which was a much more linear, 'Hollywood'-style horror movie.\"\n\nHellraiser: Judgment Interview\n\nBy Brad Miska, Bloody Disgusting.com, 16 March 2016\n\nGary Tunnicliffe: \"So far [it's been] a dream come true. Dimension was very supportive with the darker elements of the script - although I had to tone it down a little - and they had great notes and suggestions...\n\n\"From call 'till wrap the cast and crew just busted their collective asses with enthusiasm. I'm sure they thought that what we were shooting at times was crazy, but everyone seemed to dig it, and I always felt they had my back. I was so sad to get to the final scene and hear, 'That's a wrap!' On a personal level, it was the culmination of a lifetime dream, from the kid who sat in the cinema in 1987 and had his life changed [by Clive Barker's original film] to finding himself thirty years later on the set directing [one]...\n\n\"Clive has always been the author who could describe the most intense, awful visual in the most poetic way that made you just read on and on. I've tried to emulate that visually [in that] what you are watching is disgusting, but it's presented in such a way that makes it pleasing to the eye. Hopefully.\"\n\nExclusive: Gary Tunnicliffe Talks Hellraiser: Judgment; New Image from the Set!\n\nBy Sean Decker, Dread Central.com, 17 March 2016\n\nDoug Bradley: \"I was a bit taken aback by the idea of this nondisclosure agreement on principal, I suppose. And it is clear that, once again, the reason for this film being made is exactly the same as Revelations. At the same time that Revelations was made, they made another Children of the Corn movie, which made sense because they bought into both franchises at exactly the same time, on the back of Hellraiser 3, which we shot back-to-back with Children of the Corn 3. And what are they shooting right now? Another Children of the Corn movie. That tells you everything you need to know, I think.\n\n\"So I told Gary that I wasn't going to sign the NDA and they moved on very quickly. Gary gave an interview to Fangoria in which he said they started recasting the next day. Nobody picked up the phone... It was just 'OK,' and recast, which tells me that they didn't really want me in the first place, or not all that much.\n\n\"It's a slightly puzzling situation, as well, Gary has told me and the Fangoria readers that this is one hundred percent an original screenplay. Now he's saying that he wrote it as a Hellraiser film some years ago. I'm trying to fill in the blanks, but maybe that would be after Revelations, and nobody wanted to make it. Then it resurfaced in, I think 2013, as his Kickstarter movie called Judgment, which he told us was 'a horror movie like no other'. I saw the teaser trailer, and it had this guy with a very deep voice with scars across his head, diagonally it has to be said, but scars and a deep voice playing a toy music box which sort of reminded me of another horror movie we're all very familiar with. But Gary said it was a horror movie like no other, so I must be mistaken.\n\n\"Anyway, that Kickstarter campaign failed and now here we are with that movie, that was a Hellraiser movie, then was not a Hellraiser movie, and now suddenly is a Hellraiser movie again... I'm looking forward to seeing it.\"\n\nDoug Bradley Tells iHorror 'What you needed to know' Regarding Absence from Hellraiser: Judgment\n\nBy Landon Evanson, iHorror.com, 22 March 2016\n\nGary Tunnicliffe: \"Filming in Oklahoma was nothing short of a phenomenal experience. I was blessed with a cast, crew and locations that propelled the film far beyond our meager budget.\n\n\"We filmed in an incredible derelict building, under an amazing water tower, in a tremendous bar, perfect high end apartment building and penthouse suite, a beautiful church interior, children's playground, creepy alleyways and on our phenomenal 'stage' where we took great advantage of existing rooms and my phenomenal art department built beautiful sets!\n\n\"My own team of make up effects titans (lead by Mike Regan and Mike Measimer) delivered the goods on set and bought to life Chatterer, the Stitch Twins, The Butcher, The Surgeon, The Auditor and of course Pinhead handling make up fx and costumes plus the various gags and key props needed for the film.\"\n\nA Few Words About Hellraiser: Judgment\n\nBy Gary Tunnicliffe, Two Hours In The Dark.net, [March 2016]\n\nPaul T. Taylor: \"Some people may not understand exactly who Pinhead is. They may want to go back and look at Hellraiser 1, 2 and 3... maybe even 4... and see some of the history. But, at the same time, it is a new chapter. It's an unexplored part of Hell, I would say, introducing some new characters and some new mechanisms behind where Pinhead and all of that comes from. And, it's also a jumping off point for a sequel following this one that could continue the story that it tells because it's a true Hellraiser script with a beginning, a middle, and a sort of ambiguous end. And these new characters they introduced could be in future Hellraiser films. I can't talk about them. I'm not supposed to because that would be giving spoilers away. But, I think people are going to be fascinated with it and the gore elements that we get from like the Saw movies and the things that are total, what I would say, on the border of horror porn, there's some elements of that in it and that will please many Hellraiser fans and many fans of just what contemporary horror can be these days where it's just a gross-out.\n\nChilling Out\n\nBy Trunkprc, Open The Trunk, 24 March 24 2017\n\nGary Tunnicliffe: [re. Kickstarter project] \"'Judgement' is a world within our world, a place where Heaven and Hell collide, one of many hundreds, possibly thousands of 'spiders webs' across the globe, places where the good and the bad are processed...'audited'\n\n\"One man's demise marks the beginning of a Police Detective's journey into this world, a world where the very blood in your veins reveals the secrets of who and what you really are.\n\n\"But even the 'processing machine' that has run so smoothly for millennium upon millennium will falter when something 'different' finds its way into the mix and that 'something' will create ripples that become waves, cause black and white to become grey and will shift the powers of good and evil forever.\"\n\nJUDGEMENT - 'Not a wallet, a pack of cards or a cycle bell'\n\nBy Gary J. Tunnicliffe, Kickstarter.com, 5 August 2013\n\nGary Tunnicliffe: [re. Kickstarter project] \"It is the idea that you could step into a room and suddenly find yourself being judged. Everybody has dark secrets, and things you'd prefer people not know. Here your blood will literally tell people whether you are guilty or not guilty. What kind of sin is enough to get you admitted or not admitted to either place?\n\n\"Early on we happen upon somebody who has stumbled upon this place where he is judged and processed in a spectacular way, and a police man comes looking for him and finds himself thrown into the same process... When you are processed you first meet the character of 'The Auditor', who interviews you, along with an intravenous tube running from your arm into a typewriter he is typing on. The pages are pieces of flesh. After he has interviewed you, the pages are left for 'The Assessor', who is kind of heavy set guy wearing a too-small suit. He enters the room carrying a suitcase, which contains a knife, a fork, and a vial. He eats the pages, and then vomits the contents into a receptacle inside the room, and there is a tube leading from that receptacle into another room to the jury, who then drink that vomit and make their judgment on whether he is guilty or not guilty. From there it gets bad.\"\n\nQ&A: FX Artist Gary J. Tunnicliffe talks Kickstarter feature 'JUDGEMENT'\n\nBy Justin Beahm, Fangoria.com, 5 August 2013"
