        "text": "It's an exciting time to be a fan of Clive Barker. In addition to the Books of Blood movie coming to Hulu on October 7th, a Hellraiser series in development at HBO, and a Hellraiser reboot feature film in the works, there's also a Nightbreed TV series in the pipeline, with the Great Imaginer himself involved.\n\nIn a recent interview with ComingSoon.net, Barker revealed that he's working on \"the bible\" for the series adaptation of his 1988 novella Cabal, and he also shared that the project is slated to be directed by Michael Dougherty (Trick 'r Treat, Krampus, Godzilla: King of the Monsters), who is also part of the creative team developing the Hellraiser series at HBO. Dougherty confirmed his involvement with Nightbreed to Collider.\n\nHere's what Barker told ComingSoon.net about returning to the world of Cabal, which he previously adapted for the big screen with the 1990 film Nightbreed:\n\n“It’s exciting, after 30 years, to go back to these characters and find out who’s still speaking to me, who wants their story told. My tongue isn’t in my cheek when I say that as when I start a piece, it’s listening. The writing is a piece of listening, I’ve always said I was a journalist and what I was reporting on was the space between my ears.”\n\nBack in 2018, Deadline reported that the SYFY channel was developing the Nightbreed series, with Barker, writer Josh Stolberg (Jigsaw, Piranha 3D), Morgan Creek Entertainment, and Universal Cable Productions.\n\nThe Morgan Creek trio of James G. Robinson, David Robinson and Barbara Wall and Seraphim Films' Barker and Mark Miller are executive producing the show, which has not officially been ordered to a full series.\n\nAccording to Deadline's previous report, the Nightbreed TV series \"explores race relations in America, only the races are Humans and Monsters. It follows a group of underground half-human/half-monsters seeking to find a new refuge and home after their original hiding place is destroyed. Leading these efforts is a recently turned reluctant hero who not only is adjusting to his new supernatural status but also is dealing with the grief and mystery surrounding the death of his fiancée. Will this group band together despite being hunted and persecuted by humans who find their “otherness” to be frightening?\"\n\nStay tuned to Daily Dead for more updates on the Nightbreed TV series, and keep an eye out for our upcoming interview with Barker and Brannon Braga for the new Books of Blood movie!"
