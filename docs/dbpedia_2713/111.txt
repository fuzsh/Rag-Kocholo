One of the main features of Collier Memorial State Park is the Collier Logging Museum. This outdoor museum boasts a large collection of historic logging equipment, some of which dates back to the 1880s. The collection includes ox drawn 'high wheels', steam-powered 'donkey engines', steam tractors, diesel 'cats', and a Beloit tree harvester. The museum also displays large saw mill machinery and railroad equipment used to transport logs out of the forest.
