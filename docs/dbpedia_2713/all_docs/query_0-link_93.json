        "text": "It All Started Here, And Here Lives On\n\nWood River Valley is the old west surrounded by mountains and it can be\n\na stopping point halfway between Harriman Springs and Crater Lake. In\n\nthe valley there are wonderful places to visit: Kimball Park, Wood River\n\nDay Use Area and the Klamath Hatchery on Crooked Creek.\n\nFort Klamath\n\nFort Klamath is an unincorporated community of barely 200 people and\n\nis one of the oldest settlements in Klamath County. Fort Klamath post\n\noffice was established January 6, 1879. In the summer, cattle are trucked\n\nin and graze on rich pasture grass. The town is located about a mile\n\nnorthwest of Fort Klamath, the Oregon Trail military outpost, which is\n\nlisted on the U.S. National Register of Historic Places.\n\nGPs: 42°41′31″N, 121°58′20″W\n\nFort Klamath Museum\n\nLocated north of Klamath Falls on Hwy. 62. Fort Klamath was a frontier\n\nmilitary post established in 1863 at a time when the country was engaged\n\nin a Civil War. Recruits were rallied from volunteers for service for\n\nFrontier Protection and an enrollment office was established in\n\nJacksonville in late 1861. The territory they patrolled was huge as it\n\ncovered the Southern Route of the Oregon Trail known as The Applegate\n\nTrail. Most were young fellows from the farms of Oregon who came\n\nin singing this ditty: “I’m a raw recruit with a brand new suit.\n\nOne hundred dollars fourty, And I’ve just come down to Ashland town,\n\nTo fight for Jackson County.”\n\nA replica of the Guard House exhibits artifacts found on the site,\n\nphotographs and is staffed by a knowledgeable docent who tells a\n\ncompelling story of events witnessed by those who lived there.\n\nThe famous prisoners taken during the Modoc Indian War were held\n\nin the guard house during their trial and until the final days.\n\nThe site has the graves of the Modocs executed following the War.\n\nCaptain Jack, Black Jim, and Schonchin John. The Fort Klamath Jail\n\nand Post Office are on the site. A worthwhile stop on your way\n\nto Crater Lake. The grounds has a replica of the old fort Gazebo\n\nif the weather is inclement and picnic tables. Check with the\n\nKlamath County Museum for hours and days open…\n\nThe Fort Klamath Museum segment was written by Pat McMillian.\n\nKimball Park\n\nJ. F. Kimball State Park is a pristine site located at the headwaters\n\nof the Wood River. A walking trail connects the campground to the\n\nsite where the clear spring bubbles from a rocky hillside. The park\n\nis a secluded place where you can contemplate the moment while relaxing\n\nin the whispering lodgepole pines. Wood River flows from the pine forest\n\ninto open meadow land laced with picturesque quaking aspen surrounded\n\nby the southern Cascade Mountains. Wood River offers fine fishing that\n\ncan be accessed from the park by canoe. Kimball Park offers primitive\n\ncamping next to a spring-fed lagoon at the beginning of this waterway.\n\nGPS: 42°44′18″ N, 121°58′48″ W\n\nThe park is operated and maintained by the Oregon Parks and Recreation\n\nDepartment, and is located approximately 20 miles southeast of Crater Lake\n\nNational Park and 3 miles north of Fort Klamath on Oregon Road 232, off of\n\nHighway 62. The park was established in 1955, and covers 19 acres.\n\nincluding the headwaters of the Wood River.\n\nThere is a popular horse trail that begins at Collier Memorial State\n\nPark that leads through the forest to Kimball State Recreation Site.\n\nRiders must make a round trip from Collier State Park since there are\n\nno horse corrals at Kimball Recreation Site.\n\nFor Kimball Park birding information visit Klamath Birding Trails\n\nWood River Day Use Park\n\nThe Wood River Day Use Area, elevation 4200, is located along the\n\nWood River in the Upper Klamath Basin. The site offers a disabled\n\naccessible trail system that winds through stands of aspens, extending\n\nto meadow-shrub riparian areas and an overlook of the river.\n\nA diversity of wildflowers blooms during the spring and summer.\n\nIn the fall, aspen, cottonwoods, and willow turn a brilliant yellow.\n\nThe Wood River Area offers three picnic sites, fully accessible trails,\n\nfishing platforms and restrooms, but bring your own drinking water.\n\nPicnicking, fishing and wildlife viewing are popular activities.\n\nThis is also one of the popular stops along the Klamath\n\nBasin Birding trail.\n\nThere is no fee for use of the area and tables are available on\n\na first-come, first-served basis. The Wood River Day Use area is\n\nlocated off Highway 62, Crater Lake Highway. approximately two miles\n\nfrom Fort Klamath. GPS: 121° 58′ 54.12″ W, 42° 42′ 15.34″ N.\n\nFor Wood River Day Use birding information visit Klamath Birding Trails\n\nCrooked Creek Fish Hatchery\n\nKlamath Hatchery is located along Crooked Creek, a small meandering\n\nstream with a well developed riparian area. This hatchery raises\n\nrainbow, cutthroat, brook and brown trout. It provides legal-sized\n\ntrout to Klamath and Lake counties and fingerlings for lakes from\n\nthe southern Cascade Mountains east to the Idaho border. The current\n\nproduction is approximately 1 million fish each year.\n\nGPS: 42°36’30.5″ N , 121°56’34.09″ W\n\nVisitors can also purchase fish food for 25 cents per small handful\n\nand feed the trout in either the fish ponds or in Crooked Creek.\n\nThere is also a viewing area along Crooked Creek with a wooden deck\n\nto peer into the waters and feed the trout that often come up to the\n\nsurface in hopes of swallowing a food pellet or two.\n\nSome of these fish are native to the Creek and others are hatchery\n\nescapees. Crooked creek is also used for spawning by fish from\n\nKlamath and Agency Lakes during the winter and spring months.\n\nLooking south at Crooked Creek and a Flooded Wood River Valley.\n\nCrooked Creek starts from a dozen hillside springs that also supply\n\nwater for Klamath Hatchery. The springs run a nearly constant volume\n\nand stay in the middle 40s F year-round. Crooked Creek is also used for\n\nspawning by fish from Klamath and Agency Lakes during the winter and\n\nspring months. This section of creek is closed to fishing to protect\n\nwatchable fish for this viewing area. The creek is open for\n\nfishing downstream of the pasture fence during the trout season.\n\nBirds to Look For: Great Blue Heron, Osprey, Wood Duck, several\n\nwarbler species and Mountain Bluebird are commonly seen\n\naround the hatchery.\n\nWood River\n\nThe Wood River meanders 18 miles through the Fremont-Winema National\n\nForests, Bureau of Land Management land, and private property in\n\nsouthern Oregon before flowing into Agency Lake. Its watershed consists\n\nof 220 square miles of conifer forest, rural pasture land, and marsh\n\nwith headwaters emanating from a large natural spring located in\n\nJackson F. Kimball State Recreation Site. The aquifer that feeds\n\nthe spring is believed to originate twenty miles to the northwest\n\nin the east side drainage of Crater Lake National Park. The drainage\n\naround its headwaters is forest county dominated by ponderosa pine\n\nand lodgepole pine with some quaking aspen in meadow lands.\n\nThe Wood River’s largest tributary is Annie Creek which originates\n\ninside the boundary of Crater Lake National Park, and is fed by\n\nthe park’s snowpack as well as groundwater from natural springs.\n\nAfter leaving the park, Annie Creek passes through the Fremont-Winema\n\nNational Forests and then runs along the western border of Sun Pass\n\nState Forest for about a mile. It then crosses private pastureland\n\nand is joined by Sun Creek before joining the Wood River, about a\n\nmile south of Kimball State Recreation Site. From there, the Wood\n\nruns south through the Fremont-Winema National Forests and private\n\npasture land before Fort Creek joins the flow. Below Fort Creek,\n\nthe river flows through private pasture land and then opens into\n\na wide marsh. Much of the original marsh is now pasture land.\n\nWater from the river is diverted into a system of canals to\n\nirrigate grazing land in the surrounding valley. Finally,\n\nCrooked Creek joins the Wood approximately one mile before it\n\nempties into Agency Lake, which is connected to Upper Klamath Lake.\n\nThe Wood River habitat supports wild, self-sustaining populations\n\nof brook, brown, Great Basin redband, and coastal rainbow trout.\n\nThese species are widely distributed throughout the river system\n\nfrom the headwaters to Agency Lake. Bull trout are native to upper\n\nSun Creek inside Crater Lake National Park. Great Basin redband\n\ntrout and coastal rainbow trout are species, both rainbow trout\n\nsubspecies, native to the Klamath Basin.\n\nFor Wood River Valley birding information visit Klamath Birding Trails\n\nThe Wood River Was Changed By Man And Changed Again.\n\nIn September 1992, U.S. Congress appropriated funds for the\n\nBureau of Land Management to purchase 3,200 acres of natural\n\nwetland along the north end of Agency Lake at the mouth of the\n\nWood River. This wetland area was converted to pasture land in\n\nthe 1950s and 1960s. The land purchase was completed in 1994.\n\nSince acquiring the Wood River property, the Bureau of Land\n\nManagement has successfully restored the wetland area and\n\nadjacent Wood River channel to a more natural state. The channel\n\nrestoration project was completed in 2001. The new channel\n\nmeanders through the marsh, increasing the length of the\n\nWood River by over one half mile. Overall, this project has\n\nimproved water quality and created better habitat for fish,\n\nbirds and wildlife.\n\nHere are other locations near Harriman Springs Resort and Marina:\n\nBehold the spectacular Crater Lake National Park\n\nTake a moment to relax at Mare’s Eggs Springs\n\nEnjoy the sights and sounds of Upper Klamath National Wildlife Refuge\n\nFor nature enthusiasts see Bird Habitats of the Region\n\nTake a video tour of the Klamath Basin National Wildlife Refuges\n\n©2014 Anders Tomlinson, all rights reserved."
