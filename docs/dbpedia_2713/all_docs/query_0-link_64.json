        "text": "Mix Educational Stops with Fun Stops\n\nWe’ve found that if we want our kids to really enjoy our history-themed road trips, then we need to make a point of mixing historic sites with more conventionally “fun” stops. And having our Jayco toy hauler makes trips with multiple, different stops super easy. We’ll spend a couple of days at a living history museum and then drive a few hours to stay at a campground near a beach or a theme park. This way, our kids look forward to the trip, as opposed to seeing it more like a field trip. If you’re lucky, some of the historic sites will even let you camp or boondock on the property. This makes it especially easy to have a great educational trip and a fun camping experience all in one.\n\nMake Stops Culturally Relevant\n\nAnother key for planning fun historical trips with kids is to make them culturally relevant. I often plan trips around things the boys are learning about in school or subjects they’ve taken an interest in. For example, we made sure to hit plenty of Revolutionary War and early American history sites the year everyone was listening to the Hamilton soundtrack on repeat. When you let your kids walk the battlefields they’ve read about in history class or see the birthplace of an icon they’ve only ever heard about in the news, it stays in their minds on a much deeper, more personal level.\n\nExpand Your Search\n\nIf you’re having a hard time finding historically significant places within driving distance of your home, try expanding your search beyond just battlefields and historic landmarks. The national parks system might be most known for preserving natural spaces, but it also protects hundreds of historically significant sites. These sites are usually very well done, with short films, museums, and ranger-led talks and tours. Local state parks are also great to check out, as they will often run programs or exhibits that highlight the state’s unique history.\n\nTake Age Into Consideration\n\nIf you’re traveling to a historic place with younger children, make sure to take their ages and attention spans into account. I could tour lavishly decorated historic houses all day long, but my seven-year-old doesn’t always share my love of interior design (especially if he can’t touch anything). Fortunately, many historic sites are kid-friendly and go the extra mile to make sure young visitors have a great experience. Look for places with lots of outdoor space where kids are free to roam. Nearly all of the National Park Service units offer a Junior Ranger program. This program allows kids the opportunity to complete various activities and fill out a workbook as they go around the site. At the end of their visit, they can turn in their workbook and be sworn in as a Junior Ranger, complete with a custom badge. Other museums and historic sites sometimes offer scavenger hunts or activity packs that you can rent. These aren’t always well-advertised, so it’s worth searching the website before your visit to see what’s offered or ask about kid activities once you get there.\n\nOne final note to all the parents out there: Don’t worry if you feel like your kids are not listening to every word of the tour guide or reading all of the signs and plaques. I’m sure they are still soaking up a lot of knowledge without you even realizing it. And even more importantly, they’re building fun memories that will stay with them for their whole lives."
