        "text": "COLLIER MEMORIAL STATE PARK, CHILOQUIN, OREGON\n\nOur Opinion: Recommend. This makes an excellent base camp for visits to Crater Lake.\n\nDate of Stay: October 9 through 11, 2009. Updated October 2011.\n\nWeather During Stay: Mostly sunny, cool days and COLD (mid-20’s) nights.\n\nSites: 50 FHU sites (30/50 amp) in two loops tucked among huge pine trees, heavily shaded. Most sites are reasonably level and large enough to accommodate big rigs. Nine of the sites are pull-outs - quite close to the narrow campground road - while the rest are back ins. The campground road and all the FHU sites are paved; an additional 18 dry camping sites are gravel with tent pads. All sites are first-come, first-served - and were full each of the 3 nights we stayed there. (Edit: plenty of space available in October of 2011, though early arrivals had a far better selection.)\n\nOnsite facilities include restrooms with flush toilets and hot showers, laundry facilities, and pay phone. Four sets of campground hosts kept the campground well-groomed and sold firewood.\n\nRate: We paid $13 per night (Oregon’s “Discovery season” rate) for 50 amp FHU. The in-season rate is $17, still a bargain - but we heard the fees would be increasing by $4/night next year due to budget problems. (Edit: Paid $17/night for FHU October 2011, Discovery Season rate.)\n\nPhone/radio/TV: Good Verizon phone and aircard signals. Our roof-top mounted TV satellite couldn’t find a signal through all the trees, though there were a few sites (very few) that might work. No TV stations on the over-the-air antenna. No radio stations - hurray for Sirius satellite radio! (Edit: Jefferson Public Radio, an NPR station, available on 90.9 in October 2011.)\n\nElevation/Landscape/Terrain: Flat, level parking at about 4,000 ft. Views are of neighbors and tall pines. A few of the sites on the south side of the campground had views of the Williamson River.\n\nLighting/Noise: Very dark and very quiet at night - lots of stars.\n\nFavorite Sites: We probably would opt for a site near the river next time - until we explored the campground on foot, we didn’t realize there is a river nearby. We didn’t like any of the pull-outs along side the campground road, but they were snapped up by those who don’t like backing in.\n\nHiking/Walking: Though it was not immediately apparent, this campground has GREAT walking. Beautiful, clear Spring Creek joins the Williamson River very close to the campground, and trails along the riverbanks are a real treat.\n\nThe state park is also home to the interesting Collier Memorial Logging Museum and Pioneer Village, a short walk away along the river.\n\nComments: This campground would rate a RAVE but for one thing: lack of privacy in the sites. The sites are roomy and very well maintained, but have no bushes to provide any privacy at all… that’s how it is in a pine forest. We certainly will return, though. Only 25 beautiful miles from the campground to the southern entrance to Crater Lake National Park."
