        "text": "One of the main features of Collier Memorial State Park is the Collier Logging Museum. This outdoor museum boasts a large collection of historic logging equipment, some of which dates back to the 1880s. The collection includes ox drawn 'high wheels', steam-powered 'donkey engines', steam tractors, diesel 'cats', and a Beloit tree harvester. The museum also displays large saw mill machinery and railroad equipment used to transport logs out of the forest.\n\nActivities and Facilities at the Park\n\nCollier Memorial State Park offers a variety of activities for visitors. These include hiking, camping, picnicking, and fishing. The park has well-developed facilities, including 50 sites with recreational vehicle hook-ups and 18 tent sites. There are also four horse corrals, modern restrooms, hot showers, and laundry facilities. The park is open to campers from April through October, with campsites available on a first-come, first-served basis.\n\nFishing at the Park\n\nCollier Memorial State Park is located at the confluence of the scenic Williamson River and Spring Creek. The Williamson River is well known for its trout fishing. Brook, rainbow, and native Great Basin redband trout are found in the Williamson River in this area. The brook and rainbow trout often reach 20 inches, and the redband trout in the Williamson River can reach record size, up to 5 pounds."
