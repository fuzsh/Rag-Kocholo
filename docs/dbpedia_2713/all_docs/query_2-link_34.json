        "text": "Our Opinion: Recommend. Roomy sites, lovely rivers nearby, pleasant walking trails, interesting logging museum, and reasonably close proximity to Crater Lake.\n\nOur first visit to Collier Memorial State park was two years ago, when we used it was a base camp to visit Crater Lake. On this visit, we stayed two night, October 7-8.\n\nA few things have changed:\n\nThe Discovery Season rate increased $4/night, to $17. Still a very good rate for a spacious, paved FHU site (50 amps) in a very nicely maintained campground. Still first-come, first served (no reservations taken). We arrived on Friday at noon and had our pick of many sites; folks arriving later on Friday had fewer choices, but the campground was not full on Friday or Saturday night.\n\nWhen we visited in 2009, no local NPR station was available. You can now pick up Jefferson Public Radio, the NPR broadcast for southern Oregon and northern California, on 90.9 FM."
