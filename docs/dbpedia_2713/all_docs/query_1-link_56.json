At the state's finest logging museum, you'll see rare and antique logging equipment dating to the 1880s, as well as more recent pieces.\n\nRailroad buffs will enjoy learning about the role the railroad played in logging. You can imagine the rugged woodsmen and the immense task of moving raw timber with innovation and brute force. The pioneer village gives you another insight into how these families once lived.\n\nMajor Features & Activities\n\nCamping\n\nHiking Trails\n\nPicnicking\n\nFishing\n\nHorse Trails\n\nKayaking"
