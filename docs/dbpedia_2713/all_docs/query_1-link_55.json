        "text": "| Beautiful park\n\nThis is a beautiful setting in a state park, with campsites nestled among the trees. The road and the pads for the RVs are paved asphalt, and the hookups look new and in great condition. Very pleasing atmosphere, a bit off of the highway, so the noise is muffled - yet access is still convenient and easy. The highway to approach Crater Lake N.P. is only about 4 miles to the south - so this is a convenient location from which to explore this part of the state. If we come back through this area, we'll definitely come to this park again.\n\n| Relax in nature\n\nSuper nice campground with lots of big trees and a nice outdoor feel. Even the drive into the campground is through a beautiful forest with towering trees. Just a few minutes trail walk from a river and the (outdoor) Logging Museum. A quiet place to rest and relax. The showers were really nice. No Wi-Fi of course but good cell reception."
