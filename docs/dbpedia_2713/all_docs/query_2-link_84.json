If you don’t have that number, enter your last name as it appears on your tax bill or enter just your house number and street name without any directional or suffix. When searching, less information will bring up more results. If you enter too much and it’s not exact, your search will result in “No records found”.\n\nPlease make check payable to \"Peoria County Collector\" and mail payment to:\n\nPeoria County Collector\n\nPO Box 1925\n\nPeoria, IL 61656-1925\n\n1st Installment Due: 6/4/2024\n\n2nd Installment Due: 9/4/2024\n\nLast day to pay to avoid Tax Sale: 11/1/2024\n\nTax Sale: 11/4/2024\n\nPlease make sure the Supervisor of Assessments has your most current address on file.\n\nFailure to receive a real estate tax bill or receiving it late for any reason does not relieve the taxpayer of penalties accruing if taxes are not paid by their respective due dates.\n\nDownloadable Forms"
