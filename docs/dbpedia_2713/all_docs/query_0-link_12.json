If you rely solely on Starlink, take this into consideration when choosing a site.\n\nLaundry: No\n\nFacilities/Amenities: Restrooms, Outdoor logging museum, hiking trails\n\nTrash: Dumpsters located at exit beyond the camp host site\n\nPros: Inexpensive campground within short drive to Crater Lake National Park\n\nCons: Traffic noise from main highway, over half an hour drive to Klamath Falls for shopping/restaurants (basic needs can be found in nearby Chiloquin)"
