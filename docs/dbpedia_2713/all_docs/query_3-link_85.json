        "text": "Our organization was formed as the Oregon State Parks Trust in May of 1995 by the first Chairman of the Oregon State Parks Commission, Brian Booth. He saw an opportunity to engage private philanthropy to help deal with the long term problem of under-funding of our state parks. Brian gathered a group of notable Oregonians as the first group of Trustees, including Lu Beck, Cynthia Ford, Bob Meinen, Bill Naito, Lynn Newbry, Nancy Russell, Stub Stewart, Bill Sweet and Dave Talbot. The Trust was renamed to Oregon State Parks Foundation in 2012 and then to Oregon Parks Forever in 2020.\n\nSome of our most notable capital projects have been building a new Experience Center at Cottonwood Canyon, the renovation of the Vista House in the Columbia Gorge, the establishment of the Kam Wah Chung Museum, the renovation of seven lighthouses along the coast, and the addition of the first 50 yurts in state park campgrounds- a first anywhere in the country."
