        "text": "Jamie Francis/The Oregonian\n\nOld Chief Joseph's Gravesite is near Iwetemlaykin State Heritage Area, named in honor of the Nez Perce tribe.\n\nWhen you visit all the state parks in Oregon, the memories you carry home are of the views, the beaches, the campgrounds, the trees. What’s easy to miss are the names of the parks themselves.\n\nDozens of our state parks are named for people, and while some of their names may sound familiar, most become abstracted within our experience. We talk about going to “Honeyman” or “Stub Stewart” but who are those people? And why do parks now bear their names?\n\nParks not named for people reflect our culture in more nuanced ways: a doll, a cook stove, a shipwrecked boiler. By diving into the history of these names, we can uncover small slices of Oregon history, deepening our understanding of how these lands became public in the first place.\n\nHere are the stories behind 30 of those Oregon state park names, taken from the Oregon Parks and Recreation Department and reference book “Oregon Geographic Names.” They range from the coast to the other side of the Cascades, and across the history of our state.\n\nJamie Hale/The Oregonian\n\nBEVERLY BEACH STATE PARK\n\nBeverly Beach was originally the name of a small community adjacent to where the state park is now. Florence and Curtis Christy were the first to settle there, and it was their young daughter, Florence, who named the beach \"Beverly\" after her favorite doll.\n\nCourtesy of Oregon State Parks\n\nBOB STRAUB STATE PARK\n\nOriginally called Nestucca Spit State Park, the coastal park on Nestucca Bay was renamed in 1987 for former Oregon Gov. Robert Straub, who supported the Oregon Beach Bill and opposed a plan that would build a highway at the spit.\n\nJamie Hale/The Oregonian\n\nBOILER BAY STATE SCENIC VIEWPOINT\n\nBoiler Bay isn't named for the tumultuous ocean on the central Oregon coast, but for an actual ship's boiler that is still there today. The boiler is from the J. Marhoffer schooner, which in 1910 caught fire, lost control, ran into the cliffs and exploded. You can venture out to see the boiler at extremely low tides.\n\nJohn M. Vincent/The Oregonian\n\nBULLARDS BEACH STATE PARK\n\nBullards Beach State Park is named for Robert W. Bullard, who in 1882 established a general store and post office at the mouth of the Coquille River. He also operated ferry across the river, from what today is the state park over to Bandon.\n\nCourtesy of Oregon State Parks\n\nCARL G. WASHBURNE MEMORIAL STATE PARK\n\nThe state park north of Heceta Head is named for Carl G. Washburne, a Eugene businessman who was the Oregon highway commissioner from 1932 to 1935. Land for the park was gifted to the state in 1962 by his wife, Narcissa Washburne.\n\nOregonian File Photo\n\nCHAMPOEG STATE HERITAGE AREA\n\nChampoeg State Heritage Area was the site of the first warehouse for the Hudson's Bay Company on the Willamette River, and has a lot of historical significance. The name is thought to be derived from the French word champ, meaning \"field,\" and a tribal word, probably poich meaning \"root.\" It also might be an entirely native word, possibly campuik, which could have been a name for the false caraway plant.\n\nCourtesy of Oregon State Parks\n\nCLYDE HOLLIDAY STATE RECREATION AREA\n\nThe eastern Oregon recreation site was given to the state by local rancher Clyde Holliday and his family. He arrived in Grant County in the 1940s and set up a logging operation, but later got into cattle ranching.\n\nCourtesy of Oregon State Parks\n\nCOLLIER MEMORIAL STATE PARK\n\nThe land that today is Collier Memorial State Park belonged to Charles and Janet Collier, owners of the Swan Lake Moulding Company in Klamath Falls. In 1945, their sons donated the land to the state as a memorial to their parents, along with a museum containing the family's collection of logging equipment.\n\nCourtesy of Oregon State Parks\n\nDABNEY STATE RECREATION AREA\n\nFound near the Columbia River Gorge, Dabney State Recreation Area is on land originally owned by Richard and Martha Dabney. The couple came to Oregon in 1887, where they made lucrative investments in timber and real estate. They kept a summer house at the site until Richard's death in 1916.\n\nJamie Hale/The Oregonian\n\nDEVIL’S LAKE STATE RECREATION AREA\n\nNow a public recreation area and campground, Devil's Lake was originally named after a local tribal legend that spoke of a giant fish or marine monster that lived in the lake. The apostrophe is often absent, but Oregon State Parks maintains it from historical documents.\n\nCourtesy of Oregon State Parks\n\nDEXTER STATE RECREATION SITE\n\nOn a reservoir south of Eugene, the Dexter State Recreation Site gets its name from the local community that in 1875 changed from Butte Disappointment to Dexter. The name is thought to have come from a \"Dexter\" brand cook stove.\n\nJamie Hale/The Oregonian\n\nECOLA STATE PARK\n\nOne of the most popular and prominent state parks on the Oregon coast, Ecola took its name from nearby Ecola Creek in Cannon Beach, which was first named by William Clark in 1806.
