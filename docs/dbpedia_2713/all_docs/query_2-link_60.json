        "text": "Share\n\nTweet\n\nFor a delightful surprise, pull into the Collier Memorial State Park on Hwy. 97 between Crater Lake and Klamath Falls, Oregon.\n\nThis 525-acre park sits at 4,200′ elevation. Take time to walk along the aspen-lined Williamson River Trail that runs between the campground and the not-to-be-missed Oregon’s Collier Memorial Park Logging Museum.\n\nThere are many access points to the Williamson River and crystal-clear, two-mile long Spring Creek that converge in the park.\n\n“The Williamson River is regionally famous for its quality trout fishery and consistently produces trophy fish. Spring Creek gushes dramatically out of a nearby spring, and then paints a picture-perfect scene as it flows through the park.”\n\nThe campground is open between May 1-Oct. 1. There are 50 full hookup ($26/night), 18 tent ($19) (maximum site 60 feet), 4-corral primitive horse camp. Amenities include laundry facilities, hot showers, recycling, chipmunks and the promise of a river otter.\n\nThe park is open year round for day use.\n\n— Julianne G.
