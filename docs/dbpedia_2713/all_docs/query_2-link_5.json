        "text": "Collier Memorial State Park features a campground, outdoor museum of historic logging equipment, relocated pioneer village and a new four-corral, primitive horse camp and trailhead. At the state’s finest logging museum, you’ll see rare and antique logging equipment dating to the 1880s, as well as more recent pieces.\n\nThe Williamson River and crystal-clear Spring Creek converge in the park. The river is regionally famous for its quality trout fishery that consistently produces trophy fish. Spring Creek gushes dramatically out of a nearby spring, painting a picture-perfect scene as it flows through the park.\n\nFrom the equestrian trailhead located in the horse camp, you can ride north from the park across Fremont-Winema National Forest land to the Jackson F. Kimball State Recreation Site and beyond.\n\nWhether you come for the day to visit the logging museum, play along Spring Creek or camp among the pines along the Williamson River—you’ll discover a grand adventure at Collier.\n\nSeasonal Camping\n\nAll campsites have a picnic table and fire pit. Book reservations up to 6 months in advance at oregonstateparks.reserveamerica.com.\n\nA Loop\n\n16 full-hookup sites\n\n18 non-hookup sites with water nearby\n\nRestroom with hot showers and flush toilets\n\nB Loop\n\n30 full-hookup sites (nine pull-through)\n\nRestroom with hot showers and flush toilets\n\nHorse Camp\n\n2 sites, each with 2 corrals\n\nFlush restroom nearby; showers located in main campground\n\nTrailhead for USFS Rd 390, a multi-use trail that extends for 10+ miles\n\nThe dump station is available when the campground is open.
