Ron DeSantis stopped in Collier County Tuesday to make a special announcement for the Memorial Day weekend.\n\n“I am pleased to be able to be here today to announce, because we want as many people to be able to enjoy this as possible, that for the entire Memorial Day weekend, we are suspending all entry fees for all Florida state parks,\" the governor said at the Naples Yacht Club in South Naples.\n\nDeSantis said that all entrance fees for Florida's state parks will be waived from May 24 through the 27.\n\nLater, at another press conference, this one in Tampa, DeSantis announced that he would be signing the Freedom Summer Sales Tax Holiday, in the budget for Fiscal Year 2024-25. The Sales Tax Holiday will take place the entire month of July and will make items such as fishing supplies, outdoor recreation equipment, admissions to state parks and, museums sales tax free.\n\nDuring his Naples visit, the governor explained the reasoning behind the parks fee waiver: \"We think that that'll make a difference, entice more people to get out and enjoy the great outdoors,” he said.\n\nIn highlighting local state parks such as Collier-Seminole and Lovers Key and others, DeSantis touted that Florida’s state parks had 29 million visitors in 2023 and generated an annual economic impact of $3.6 billion. He said those figures come from state support:\n\n“Since 2019, we've invested more than $440 million in our state parks, because we want to ensure that Florida families are able to enjoy them now and in the future,\" he said. \"I have a budget coming up that we're still going through. But I can report that we are going to include the additional $15 million for the state parks in the upcoming budget. So our commitment remains and we're going to continue to do it.”\n\nThe governor also highlighted the awards Florida’s state parks have received including four gold medals from the National Parks and Recreation Association, more than any other state.\n\nAppearing with the governor was Lt. Governor Jeanette Nuñez, Florida Department of Environmental Protection Secretary Shawn Hamilton.\n\n\"What you're able to see when you visit these state parks is the unique things that we really consider what is part of Florida's history so our wildlife, our aquatic life, our trails, our springs, our rivers,\" Nuñez said. \"Over the last couple of months I've endeavored to visit as many state parks as possible and I've visited close to 20. What I've noticed is that each State Park has something different for everyone. And what I'll tell you is that no two parks are the same. Each one has something unique and different for every age for every interest for every hobby.\"\n\nHamilton encouraged state residents to take advantage of the free entry days: \"I challenge you to get out this holiday weekend, spend time with your family connecting to the resources honoring our nation's heroes.\"\n\nSale Tax Holiday\n\nThe Freedom Month Sales Tax Holiday will remove the sales tax on items families use during the summer, including:\n\nBoating and water activity supplies:\n\nGoggles and snorkels ($25 or less)\n\nPool toys ($35 or less)\n\nCoolers, Life jackets, Paddles ($75 or less)\n\nInflatable water tubes and floats, Wakeboards ($150 or less)\n\nPaddleboards, Surfboards ($300 or less)\n\nCanoes, Kayaks ($500 or less)\n\nFishing Supplies:\n\nBait and Tackle ($5 or less for individual items, $10 or less for multiple items sold together)\n\nTackle boxes ($30 or less)\n\nReels, Rods ($75 or less)\n\nCamping Supplies:\n\nFlashlights ($30 or less)\n\nSleeping bags, Camping chairs ($50 or less)\n\nTents ($200 or less)\n\nOutdoor Supplies:\n\nSunscreen ($15 or less)\n\nWater bottles ($30 or less)\n\nBicycle helmets ($50 or less)\n\nOutdoor grills ($250 or less)\n\nBicycles ($500 or less)\n\nAdmissions to events or performances scheduled to be held between July 1, 2024 and December 31, 2024:\n\nLive music events\n\nLive sporting events\n\nMovies to be shown in a movie theater\n\nBallets\n\nPlays\n\nFairs\n\nFestivals\n\nAdmissions purchased for any of the following:\n\nMuseums, including annual passes\n\nState parks, including annual passes\n\nSeason tickets for ballets, plays, music events, and musical theater performances"
