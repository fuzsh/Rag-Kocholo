The museum itself is worth a stopover on any trip to the area, but hiking trails run along both rivers, which host healthy fish populations, including record Great Basin red band trout. Spring Creek itself is a geological curiosity. Its source is perhaps 30 miles to the west on the east side of Crater Lake, but it only sees the light of day where it gushes forth about two miles north of Collier as a full-blown river! Note that much of the state park was affected by the 2020 Two Four Two Fire.\n\nThe 537-acre state park began as a donation by the Collier brothers, Alfred “Cap” and Andrew “Andy,” to honor their parents. The brothers also donated the first items of the now vast collection of logging equipment and artifacts. The park campground has hot showers, but note that mosquitoes are particularly abundant in spring and early summer.\n\nBegin your exploration at the logging museum itself. Exhibits west of the parking area include solid wheel wagons, tractors, and high wheels, while south of the parking area, you’ll see a sawmill demonstration, McVay log loader, and saw display. Heading north, close to Spring Creek is a “Settlers’ Village” of cabins and stores that have been move here from elsewhere. A section of rail hosts a railroad car and a McGiffert log loader. Continuing up the path, you’ll pass some agricultural artifacts, such as a hay baler and a horse-drawn mower. Find the path peeling off to the right at the end of equipment exhibits. This will take you to the shores of Spring Creek. You can walk along the grassy verge of this clear but shallow stream to a day use area with picnic tables and restrooms shaded by ponderosa pines. After this, you’ll hit private property, so return along Spring Creek to the arching wooden pedestrian bridge at the logging museum.\n\nCross the bridge, and turn right to pass under the Highway 97 road bridge along a railed walkway. Join a maintenance track that passes a footbridge leading to a second day use area. Continue south down Spring Creek, which here tumbles profusely in a series of riffles before it calmly joins the Williamson River. Stay right as you leave the maintenance track, and encounter a couple of spurs leading to the campground. Near the confluence with the Williamson, an interpretive sign explains the phenomenon of Spring Creek. Bear east along the verge of the Williamson River through thickets of willow, wormwood, bitterbrush, rabbitbrush, and golden current. Reach a four-way junction: You will keep straight here (Going left takes you to the campground, while a right turn conveys you to the river bank.).\n\nKeep right at the next junction, where a path veers off to the left for the park’s amphitheater. Douglas squirrels chatter as they scramble up the lodgepole and ponderosa pines, and chipmunks scuttle under the aspens. Spiraea lines the trail as you arrive at another junction. Stay right for the Riverside Loop, and pass through a thinned area with thickets of aspen. As you cross a willow-aspen flat, look for beaver activity. A short stretch of trail leads along a dike to reach the Williamson River, where you’ll hike along the grassy verge at a swooping bend. Pass a small circle of log benches on your left labeled ‘Camp Hawks Rest’ to turn away from the river and enter a dense aspen grove. Go right at a junction to join the Williamson River Trail, and follow a wide track across a ponderosa/lodgepole flat to reach a road bed. Heading right will eventually take you to the Forest Service’s Williamson Campground; make a left to head towards the Collier Campground. Reach a dirt road, turn right, and come to the dumpster area at the campground as golden-mantled ground squirrels scurry about.\n\nGo left and then right on the campground loop, staying right to walk around Loop B. Just past site B17, find the trail leading down to Spring Creek, where you’ll make a right. Hike up along Spring Creek, and cross the pedestrian bridge to the day use area. Go right to pass under Highway 97, using the Collier Promenade Bridge to arrive at the logging museum once again.\n\nFacilities\n\nCampground with hot showers open May 1st to October 1st\n\nDay use areas with restrooms and picnic tables open all year\n\nLogging museum open 8:00 a.m. to 8:00 p.m. June through August and 8:00 a.m. to 4:00 p.m. September through May\n\nDogs on leash\n\nMaps\n\nMaps: Hike Finder\n\nCollier Memorial and Jackson F.
