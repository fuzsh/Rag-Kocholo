        "text": "First Day Hikes are back at state park sites across Oregon, once again encouraging people to spend New Year’s Day outside and with community.\n\nThe state park program will offer free guided hikes at 31 parks on Jan. 1, the Oregon Parks and Recreation announced earlier this month. All parking fees will also be waived for the day.\n\nParticipating parks include big names such as Silver Falls and Smith Rock, as well as smaller sites like Sitka Sedge and Elijah Bristow. A few parks are hosting two hikes Jan. 1, and several require advance registration. More information and registration is available online at stateparks.oregon.gov.\n\nHERE IS OREGON: HereisOregon.com | Instagram | YouTube | Facebook | Twitter | TikTok\n\nOregon state parks have been hosting New Year’s hikes since 2012, joining in a national movement that began in Massachusetts in 1992.\n\n“When more parks offer hikes, Oregonians have more options to hike near their homes or explore a new park and trail,” Oregon state parks Director Lisa Sumption said in a news release. “Plus, this year we’re including more trail accessibility information in our online hike descriptions and are offering reasonable accommodations so visitors of all abilities can join us.”\n\nHere’s a full list of First Day Hikes in Oregon:\n\nBanks-Vernonia State Trail\n\nBullards Beach State Park\n\nChampoeg State Heritage Site (registration required)\n\nCollier Memorial State Park (registration required)\n\nCottonwood Canyon State Park\n\nDepoe Bay Whale Center\n\nDeschutes River State Recreation Area: (registration required)\n\nDetroit Lake State Park\n\nElijah Bristow State Park Hike\n\nElijah Bristow State Park Horseback Ride\n\nEmigrant Springs State Heritage Area\n\nFort Stevens State Park\n\nHarris Beach State Park\n\nHistoric Columbia River Highway State Trail\n\nL.L.
