        "text": "Stay overnight, go fishing, or enjoy a hike in nature when you visit Collier Memorial State Park in Oregon. Another highlight of this state park is the outdoor museum, the Collier Logging Museum, which features a collection of antique logging equipment with items dating all the way back to the 1880s. A replica pioneer village at the museum educates visitors about the cultural history of the area. This 146-acre state park sits about 30 miles north of the town of Klamath Falls and was first opened for public use and enjoyment in 1945.\n\nThe campground at the park is divided into two loops. All of the sites at Loop B offer full hookups. At Loop A, you'll find a mixture of sites, some of which come with hookups and some without amenities. Both loops have restrooms with flush toilets and hot showers nearby. There is also a laundry facility and a dump station that overnight campers can use. An equestrian campground with two sites and four horse corrals is also available. The park does not provide Wi-Fi.\n\nWith historic sites, equestrian campgrounds, fly fishing, and lots of hiking trails to explore, there's an outdoor adventure suitable for everyone at Collier Memorial State Park. In addition, the park has natural history programs, ranger-led hikes, and a free Junior Ranger program for kids available during the peak season months. Before you leave, don't forget to stop by the visitor center to view the exhibits and to pick up a souvenir of your trip from the gift shop.\n\nKlamath Falls is the nearest town to Collier Memorial State Park. From Klamath Falls, get on US-97 heading north. You'll drive for about 30 minutes before entering the park, which sits on either side of this highway. If you're coming from Bend, Oregon take the US-97 south for about 107 miles until you reach the park.\n\nWhat is the best time of year to visit Collier Memorial State Park?\n\nThe park and the museum are both open year-round, so you can visit this park at any time. Cross-country skiing is a popular wintertime activity. Keep in mind that the campground is only open seasonally, from April to September.\n\nWhat kind of wildlife can be found in Collier Memorial State Park?\n\nBobcats, coyotes, elk, mule deer, and foxes make their home in the park. Keep an eye out to spot Western painted turtles, Pacific tree frogs, and salamanders in the wetland areas. Birdwatchers can look for flickers, several types of woodpeckers, ospreys, turkey vultures, warblers, swallows, and lots of ducks and geese."
