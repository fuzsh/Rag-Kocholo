What are the rules?\n\nGeneral\n\nMemorial Benches: The County of San Diego Department of Parks and Recreation does not currently have a formal program for memorial benches. However, on a case-by-case basis, memorial benches may be added to specific parks if they are a) managed by the County and b) at properties that need a bench. This is determined when a request is emailed to Askparks.lue@sdcounty.ca.gov.\n\nTo see if your preferred bench location is part of the County park portfolio, search by map or alphabetized list. To see if your preferred bench location is part of a more comprehensive park agency map, visit getoutsidesandiego.org. You can also do an internet search by park name, and when you visit the official homepage for that park it should portray the name of the managing agency. If you are open to other ideas, for example naming a playground, trail, event structure or sports facility, you may be interested in our Naming Rights and Sponsorship Program. Details can be found here and will continue to evolve as new parks open and new opportunities become available. This flyer has additional information.\n\nBack to top\n\nWhat discounts does County Parks offer?\n\nWe offer a number of discounts and permit options for residents who wish to spend the day at a county park. Please visit our Discounts page for more information.\n\nBack to top\n\nWhere can I access a map of all of the trails in County Parks?\n\nGreat question! We’re in the process of designing a brand new trail map that will help you navigate to and through some of our favorite trail destinations. Please check back in a couple of weeks.\n\nBack to top\n\nAre parks open year-round?\n\nYes, parks are open 7 days a week, 365 days a year unless otherwise noted. Get up-to-date park information on our News & Events page.\n\nBack to top\n\nWhich lakes and bodies of water are managed by the County of San Diego Department of Parks and Recreation?\n\nBodies of water we oversee include Lake Morena, Lindo Lake, Luelf Pond (Dos Picos County Park), two fishing ponds at Guajome Regional Park, the coastal habitat at San Elijo Lagoon and Ecological Reserve, and three hot spring-fed pools at Agua Caliente County Park. We also operate interactive water fountains at Waterfront Park and splash pads at Hilton Head, East View and Sweetwater Summit Regional Park.\n\nBack to top\n\nWhat activities are free?\n\nMany of the activities that take place in County Parks are free! From play and picnic areas to organized programs and hikes led by rangers, we have offerings to suit all ages, interests and abilities. View our Programs and Activities Guides for more information. A $3 day-use/maintenance fee is required at some locations, which support ongoing park maintenance and operations. All other fees will be listed.\n\nBack to top\n\nAre any County Parks facilities listed as designated cool zones? Yes, we maintain three community centers in central areas throughout the county. Check hours on their website or call ahead.\n\nFallbrook Community Center, (760) 728-1671\n\nLakeside Community Center, (619) 443-9176\n\nSpring Valley Community Center, (619) 479-1832\n\nBack to top\n\nCamping\n\nHow do I make camping reservations?\n\nCamping is available year-round at County Parks. First, pick your destination by visiting our Camping Page. Then make your reservation in person at 5500 Overland Ave., Suite 410, San Diego, CA 92123 between the hours of 8 a.m. and 5 p.m., Monday through Friday, or by phone toll-free at (877) 565-3600 or (858) 565-3600. You can also book directly on the Reservations Site. If you’re already at the park where you wish to camp, reservations can be made through ranger staff (pending availability). All reservations must be paid in full at the time of booking.\n\nBack to top\n\nHow much do camping reservations cost?\n\nCamping reservations vary in cost, depending on the location you select. However, tent sites typically cost between $22 and $24, partial hookup sites cost between $27 and $29, full hookup sites cost $33 (only available at Sweetwater Summit, Agua Caliente, and Lake Morena), and cabins cost between $50 and $100 (not available at Sweetwater Summit or Vallecito). View all camping destinations on our Camping Page.\n\nBack to top\n\nHow do I pay for a campsite?\n\nCampsites can be paid for via cash, check, money order, VISA, or MasterCard. Gift certificates may also be applied. All reservations must be paid in full at the time of booking.\n\nBack to top\n\nAre there any park fees besides camping fees when I’m staying overnight? There may be a cost for firewood if you wish to have a campfire in your designated fire pit. Firewood from other sources is not permitted in County Parks – this is to prevent the spread of invasive species.\n\nBack to top\n\nWhat’s the difference between a full hookup, partial hookup and non-hookup/tent site? A full hookup site includes water, electricity and sewer. A partial hookup includes water and electricity (no sewer). A non-hookup site has access to water nearby. Cabins differ by location but some offer electricity, water and a restroom inside – all come with wooden bed frames and an option for climate control.\n\nBack to top\n\nHow can I cancel my reservation?\n\nYou may cancel your camping reservation online by locating the reservation in your online account and clicking the cancel button and following the screen prompts. Your account will be credited less any reservation and cancellation fees, provided it is cancelled more than 72 hours prior to the checkin time and has not previously been changed or transferred. If you paid with cash or check, you may cancel online but will need to contact Central Reservations to process your refund. For assistance, please call (858) 565-3600 or (877) 565-3600, Monday through Friday, between the hours of 8 a.m. and 5 p.m. If calling on a weekend or holiday, please leave a detailed message including reservation number and a contact phone number on our after hours message line to document the date/time of your request and a Central Reservations Representative will call you back during regular business hours to assist you.\n\nAll fees will be forfeited if a reservation is cancelled less than 72 hours before the check-in date. Reservations cancelled more than 72 hours prior to the check in date will be refunded less a $5 cancellation fee. All reservation and transfer fees are nonrefundable. Previously changed/transferred reservations may be cancelled, but are non-refundable.\n\nReserved sites will be held until 1 p.m. on the day after the scheduled arrival date. The site will then be offered to other interested campers on a first-come, first-served basis until the next scheduled reservation for that site.\n\nBack to top\n\nHow can I change my reservation?\n\nTo change a reservation, please call (858) 565-3600 or (877) 565-3600, Monday through Friday, between the hours of 8 a.m. and 5 p.m. A $5 fee will be applied. The new reservation arrival date cannot be more than 3 months after the original reservation arrival date. Changed/transferred reservations may be cancelled but are non-refundable. If calling on a weekend or holiday, please leave a detailed message including reservation number and a contact phone number on our after hours message line to document the date/time of your request and a Central Reservations Representative will call you back during regular business hours to assist you.\n\nBack to top\n\nWhat time is check-in and check-out?\n\nCheck-in is at 2 p.m. for tent/RV sites and 4 p.m. for cabins, and check-out for all campsites is at 12 p.m. at all County campgrounds. Day-use hours are listed on individual park pages – for more information, view the Park Finder.\n\nBack to top\n\nCan we have a fire in our campsite?\n\nYes, campfires are allowed in designated fire rings between the hours of 7 a.m. and 11 p.m. All campfires must be extinguished between the hours of 11 p.m. and 7 a.m. An open-flame ban shall go into effect whenever a Red Flag Warning has been issued by the National Oceanic & Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) and will remain in effect until the Red Flag Warning is lifted by the NOAA. Because Red Flag Warnings are weather-related, no refunds can be given due to an open-flame ban.\n\nAdditionally, stoves and lanterns allowed in all campsites. For up-to-date information on open-flame bans at County Parks, please contact the park directly or call (858) 565-3600 or (877) 565-3600, Monday through Friday, between the hours of 8 a.m. and 5 p.m.\n\nBack to top\n\nAre we allowed to bring firewood into the park?\n\nDue to drought and various invasive species that can cause tree mortality at County Parks, our motto is to buy it where you burn it. Outside firewood is not permitted. Local firewood is available at all of the County’s camping parks for a nominal donation to the San Diego County Parks Society. Contact the park directly for more information.\n\nBack to top\n\nCan we run a generator in our campsite?\n\nPlease call ahead to see if generators are allowed at your preferred location. Where generators are allowed, rules will apply to ensure the noise is not disruptive to nature or other campers in the area. Generators may only run between the hours of 8 a.m. and 10 p.m. and at the discretion of park staff.\n\nBack to top\n\nDay-Use\n\nAm I allowed to bring alcoholic drinks into the park?\n\nAlcoholic beverages are permitted in most County parks, providing the alcoholic content does not exceed 20%. No alcohol is allowed at the following parks: All 4S Ranch Local Parks and Sports Park, Agua Caliente (pool areas), Cactus, Collier, Eucalyptus, Goodland Acres, Hilton Head, Jess Martin (skate park area) Lamar, Lindo Lake, Nancy Jane, Old Ironsides, Rainbow, Spring Valley, Sweetwater Lane or Waterfront Park. For more information, please call the park directly or call (858) 565-3600 or (877) 565-3600, Monday through Friday, between the hours of 8 a.m. and 5 p.m.\n\nBack to top\n\nWhere can I go fishing or boating?\n\nLake Morena County Park, a camping park located in the Campo area of San Diego County, also offers fishing and boating. Visit the park page for hours, the latest fish report, and other useful information. Due to the lake’s low water levels, the boat dock is occasionally to personal watercraft. Motor boats can be rented through the park office. Swimming is not permitted - call ahead at (619) 478-5473. Guajome Regional County Park has two ponds where people can fish, and ponds at Dos Picos County Park and Lindo Lake offer anglers two additional recreational venues.\n\nBack to top\n\nWhere can I go swimming?\n\nAgua Caliente County Park offers three naturally-fed pools that provide different ways of enjoying the parks mineral water; two outdoor pools of varying temperatures average 90 degrees and are great for families; one indoor therapeutic spa is heated to 102 degrees and outfitted with Jacuzzi jets. Agua Caliente is closed during summer months due to extreme heat; please visit the park page for more information. Swimming is not permitted in any other body of water within the County Parks system. This is for your safety as well as for the safety of the species that live in/near our regional waterways.\n\nBack to top\n\nCan I take my dog to a park?\n\nYes, we love dogs! Dogs are allowed in most County Parks except for on the trails at Agua Caliente County Park. Assistance dogs, including guide dogs, signal dogs and service dogs, are welcome at all County Parks and Recreation facilities – and we ask handlers of these dogs to comply with all associated regulations. When in a County park and on any County trails, all dogs must be on leash no longer than 6 feet. Please obey leash laws at all County parks – this is for your safety as well as for the safety of your pet. Owners with dogs that are out of control or who pose a demonstrated risk to other park-goers may be asked to leave. The fee for dogs in County campgrounds is $1 per night, per dog, and the owner must carry the license and proof of current vaccinations.\n\nBack to top\n\nEnvironmental Stewardship\n\nAre there protected species on County land? If so, what are we doing to protect them?\n\nSan Diego County parks and preserves are home to a wide diversity of species. The ecosystems that call oceans, ponds, deserts, mountains and valleys their home are unique to each area, and many contain species that are protected. Learn more about these plants and animals, and what we’re doing to protect them, on our Multiple Species Conservation Plan page.\n\nBack to top\n\nWhat are we doing about invasive species?\n\nInvasive species are plants, fungi or animals that are not native to a specific location. They disrupt the local ecosystem, changing processes that have been in play for decades – many causing harm to the areas they invade. Read Pests, Interrupted to learn more about the damage incurred by invasive species. DPR is part of a local taskforce called the Emerging Pest Steering Committee. This committee is a multi-agency group that launched years ago in response to drought and effects of the Goldspotted oak borer; last fall they updated their charter and expanded their focus to include all invasive pests including the recently discovered shot hole borer. Read additional information in this article.\n\nBack to top\n\nWhat is the Heritage Tree Program?\n\nWe’re doing what we can to protect our trees and to be forward-thinking when it comes to ways to save them. County Parks’ vision is to have a no-net-loss tree canopy in San Diego, which basically means we’re re-planting trees 3:1 wherever possible, as new resources become available. Our county-wide Heritage Tree Program was initiated to catalog existing trees and to establish requirements for maintaining tree density and diversity in all County parks. Action plans are catered to each location where tree loss or Heritage Tree protection efforts are taking place. Read additional information in this article.\n\nBack to top\n\nWhat happens when a tree dies in a County Park?\n\nThere are regular tree removals at all of our parks where dead/dying trees pose a safety risk to park users (due to drought, GSOB and other pests). This is more prevalent in our mountain region where the tree canopy is thicker. At campgrounds we can use the cut trees as firewood - in line with our \"buy it where you burn it\" campaign to prevent the spread of invasive species. The mulch can also be spread on trails and in other public areas. Dead or dying trees near or on public thoroughfares like parking lots and trails within TRVRP have been trimmed by park staff and mulched and solarized in a designated area. Our next step is to trim, mulch and solarize dead/dying trees within 25 feet of our trails. We’re always sorry to lose a tree and do our best to replant wherever trees are lost at a 3:1 ratio.\n\nBack to top\n\nPark Weddings and Events\n\nIs it cheaper to get married in a County Park?\n\nShort answer? Yes! Our 17-location park portfolio includes sites with cityscapes, mountain views, forest shade and historic ranchos. Parks are very customizable spaces with very few vendor limitations; we encourage brides and grooms to build their special day, just the way they want it, in a format that matches their budget. View the wedding venue cost comparison chart or call the reservations team between the hours of 8 a.m. and 5 p.m. Monday, through Friday at (858) 565-3600 (locally) or (877) 565-3600 (toll free).\n\nBack to top\n\nWhat are some benefits to getting married in a County Park?\n\nWe have designated “wedding trees” at Stelzer County Park, Flinn Springs County Park and El Monte County Park (all in Lakeside) as well as at William Heise County Park (Julian). There are prep kitchens at all three of our community centers (Fallbrook, Lakeside and Spring Valley) as well as at our newest wedding venue – Provence House (Bonita). Waterfront weddings can be held at Dos Picos County Park (Ramona), Lindo Lake/Lakeside Community Center, Sweetwater Summit (Bonita) and Waterfront Park (downtown). Power and restrooms are available at all of our wedding locations. Some of our wedding venues even offer bridal changing areas and overnight accommodations in the form of cabins, RV sites and tent camping sites, including: Dos Picos County Park, Heise County Park and Sweetwater Summit.\n\nBack to top\n\nDoes my photographer have to complete a film and photography permit?\n\nThe San Diego County Parks and Recreation Department maintains and operates more than 55,000 acres of beautiful and unique locations and settings. Many of these are desirable for still photographers and filmmakers for backdrops and film footage. Most of the park locations are available for use by reservation, and in many of these locations, park rangers can be on hand to assist with and monitor activities. A permit is required for any event where photos taken will be used for commercial purposes. View our web page on Permits and Fees for additional information.\n\nBack to top\n\nWhat is required to bring a jumper or bounce house into a County Park?\n\nFor parks that allow jumpers or bounce houses, a $25 permit fee is required along with proof of liability insurance and a signed hold harmless agreement – prior to the reservation. These items should be delivered to the Reservations team at 5500 Overland Avenue, Suite 410, San Diego, CA 92123 between 8 a.m. and 5 p.m. Monday through Friday or sent via email to our reservations team.\n\nBack to top\n\nI’m a vendor and I want to sell stuff at County Parks. What are the rules?\n\nWe love vendors, but there are some policies in place to ensure the right permits are secured before goods or services are shared or sold. Please contact the park where you plan to set up shop or call our reservations team between the hours of 8 a.m. and 5 p.m. Monday, through Friday at (858) 565-3600 (locally) or (877) 565-3600 (toll free)."
