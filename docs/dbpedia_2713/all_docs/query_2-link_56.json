        "text": "The stretch of the river for the tour is always a favorite, with lots of room to float around! We put in at Collier Memorial State Park day-use area and with a little paddling and some current make it to downtown Chiloquin in about 3 hours. It's a pretty easy trip with a couple of small ripples to go through to add to the fun. We'll paddle over the unique underwater lava formations where you will see the big Redband Trout, who call this river their home.\n\nThis float is one of our easiest and perfect for a beginner with little or no kayaking experience.Our licensed Oregon Guides are very experienced with years on the water and dedicated to providing you a very enjoyable experience you will remember a lifetime.\n\nWe offer Tours on the Williamson River 7 days a week with 2 departure times of 9:30AM and 1:30PM. We ask all guests to arrive 30 minutes prior to departure."
