        "text": "When we stopped at the Collier State Park, I was completely caught off guard. I thought we'd stop for maybe 5 minutes, take a couple photos and move on. Instead we stayed for close to an hour, looking at all the amazing pieces of logging history. We went off-season, so the indoor museum was closed. But even so, all of the outdoor areas were more than enough to keep us entertained and amazed! There were a small handful of other travelers walking about, but there were so many items to look at that everyone was spread out and I really felt like we had the whole place to ourselves.\n\nThe logging equipment was surprising. I had never been around such incredibly large, unique items before. It really gives you some appreciation for the strength that it must have taken to use these items and the dangers that could easily fall upon a logger. I enjoyed leisurely walking the trails, reading about the equipment and all while watching the wildlife in beautiful natural setting. Spring Creek was so clear and peaceful, I wished we'd brought a picnic to enjoy while there. I rate the Collier State Park a 10 out of 10. Stop by if you're in the area, you won't be disappointed!"
