        "text": "A modern LGBTQ+ classic presented in a stunning new 4K restoration of the Director’s Cut, When Night is Falling centers on the story of Camille (Pascale Bussières), a professor at a Christian college who is engaged to Martin (Henry Czerny), a respected fellow professor. As “career Christians” they are urged to get married so that they can become co-chaplains of the New College of Faith. When Camille meets Petra (Rachel Crawford), a wry, complex and confident performer in a modern Felliniesque circus troupe, she is profoundly drawn to her. Camille pursues her. But Petra has her own fears of falling for a “tourist” and worries about just being someone’s experiment. And the circus run by a hilarious owner (Don McKellar) is being hounded by creditors and may leave town any minute now. Camille risks throwing her whole conservative life, career, not to mention her engagement, into disarray. This hypnotically sensual drama which was selected for the Official Competition at the 1995 Berlin International Film Festival has won awards all over the world. A pioneering work of love and beauty, When Night is Falling was photographed by Douglas Koch, who captured the romantic, magical and contrasting worlds of mid-1990’s Toronto. The 4K restoration was made possible by the Canada Media Fund’s Encore+ YouTube channel in partnership with Telefilm Canada.\n\nSpecial Features:\n\n• Audio commentary by director Patricia Rozema\n\n• Suspect (2005, short film by Patricia Rozema)\n\n• Archival Interview with Patricia Rozema\n\n• Alternate French audio dub\n\n• Trailers\n\nTHIS IS A PREORDER DISC THAT IS DUE TO BE RELEASED ON OR ABOUT 6/11/24\n\nALL ITEMS ORDERED TOGETHER WILL BE CHARGED AT THE TIME OF THE ORDER\n\nAND SHIP TOGETHER WHEN EVERYTHING IS IN STOCK.
