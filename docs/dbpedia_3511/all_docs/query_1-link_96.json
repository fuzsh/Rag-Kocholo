Her erratic father and perpetually sick mother aren’t much help as she tries to navigate the tricky terrain of puberty. Feeling isolated and alone, Hannah seeks to escape in cinema, becoming fixated on the beautiful and freespirited Anna Karina in Jean-Luc Godard’s Vivre sa vie (My Life to Live).\n\nAs her home life deteriorates, the confused Hannah attempts to emulate her movie idol, making some poor and potentially dangerous decisions before finding a healthy way to express herself and cope with her world.\n\nA touching coming-of-age story that won four Jutras for director Léa Pool."
