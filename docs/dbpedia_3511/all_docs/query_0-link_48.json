        "text": "Céline Bonnier stars as Mother Augustine, a passionate and resilient Catholic nun who teaches music to children of all backgrounds in a convent school in rural Quebec in the 1960s. When her rebellious but musically gifted niece (Lysandre Ménard) joins the convent, Mother Augustine must confront a past that she strives to forget.\n\nWith the looming changes brought by Vatican II and Quebec's Quiet Revolution, the local government threatens to shut down the school in favour of public education, and Mother Augustine must search her soul for a solution – or perhaps a new calling. She and her fellow nuns are forced to confront the waves of modernity, but can Augustine move forward, or will she perish with tradition?\n\nThe film was nominated for two Canadian Screen Awards including Best Actress for Bonnier, and Best Original Score.\n\nSarah (Sophie Desmarais) is a gifted young runner whose life changes when she’s offered a spot at McGill – far from her suburban life near Quebec City. But when her fearful mother refuses to give her financial support, Sarah marries her best friend Antoine (Jean-Sébastien Courchesne) in an attempt to qualify for the best scholarships, and they set out for Montreal on their own.\n\nAntoine has feelings for Sarah, but it soon becomes clear that the only thing she truly loves is running. This assured feature-length debut from Robichaud is an unusual coming of age story and a heartfelt and subtle drama about an introverted protagonist’s late-blossoming sexuality.\n\nAfter its premiere in the Un Certain Regard section of the Cannes Film Festival, the film won the Women in Film & Television Artistic Merit Award at the Vancouver International Film Festival.\n\n“What makes Sarah Prefers to Run so touching is that we're not quite sure what the resolution will be for Sarah. She isn't, either. But she just keeps running.” – Tim Grierson, Paste Magazine\n\nActor and filmmaker Micheline Lanctôt won the Silver Lion at the Venice Film Festival for her second feature, the story of two teenage girls whose close bond, dreams, and sentimental whims are presented in a series of vignettes that move gradually from the seemingly trivial to the extremely dark.\n\nStructured around three parts, the first follows teenage Chantal (Pascale Bussières), who pursues an infatuation with a bus driver (Pierre F. Fauteux), ultimately costing him his job. The second segment follows Louisette (Marcia Pilote), who has run away from home but finds temporary affection from a Bulgarian sailor (Kliment Denchev) in the port. In the third and final chapter, the two girls come together and make a grim, disturbing plan.\n\nMicheline Lanctôt won the Genie Award for Best Director for the film.\n\nQuebec filmmaker Catherine Martin made her feature debut with this film about a 19th century woman struggling against oppressive Victorian social norms. 20-year-old Yvonne (Marie-Ève Bertrand) is a free spirit whose prudish, strict older sister Héleène (Guylaine Tremblay) struggles to contain her.\n\nHelene intends to send her sister to a convent, and when Yvonne falls in love with the rakish Charles (David Boutin), Hélène concocts a scheme to keep them apart by arranging for him to marry her own teenage daughter. Unwilling to give up her passionate desires, Yvonne heads to the woods to find her own solution.\n\nThis finely crafted historical drama was awarded Best Feature by the Quebec Association of Film Critics in 2001.\n\nIt's the summer of 1966. The sun is shining and the world is full of possibilities. But for 15-year-old Élise (Fortier), there are issues simmering beneath the surface of her happy family life.\n\nWhen a shocking discovery drives her mother to leave the family, everyone is stunned. Amid the chaos, Élise decides it's up to her to take matters into her own hands and solve the problems. While her father and two brothers withdraw into their inner world, Élise is not discouraged. Trying to keep her family's troubles a secret, she discovers that no one around her has a life as perfect as it seems at first glance.\n\nA tender and touching story of coming of age in difficult circumstances, Mommy's at the Hairdresser's is a film full of rich, vivid colors that are wonderfully evocative of hot summer days. It's not exactly the summer Élise was expecting, but it will be a summer unlike any other.\n\nClara (Catherine de Léan) and Nikolaï (Dimitri Storoge) meet at a rave, and return to his apartment for what starts out as an ordinary one-night stand. Instead of parting, the two young lovers share their deepest secrets in a sprawling conversation that explores the realities of the double lives they both lead. Nicolaï is an immigrant who envisions big projects and has big ideas but never manages to realize them. Clara is an elementary school teacher by day and a compulsive party girl by night.\n\nRevealing existential despair without succumbing to it, Nuit #1 is a refreshingly direct take on the difficulty of making meaningful connection.\n\nThe film won Best Canadian Feature Film at the Vancouver International Film Festival."
