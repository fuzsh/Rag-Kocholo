This year’s crop of nominees represents stellar Canadian filmmaking.\n\nLast year saw some changes in the acting categories. Last year, they were made gender-neutral (and the number of nominees increased to eight). This year, they have been separated into awards for comedy and drama, still with eight nominees each.
