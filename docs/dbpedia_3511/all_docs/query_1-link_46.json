It was awarded the prize by a jury presided by Quebecois actress Pascale Bussières.\n\nThe film was co-produced with France's Eaux Vives Productions, Bjoca, Jour2Fête, Ramona Productions and Arte, as well as Norway's Mer Film and Germany's Bayerischer Rundfunk. It received support from the Luxembourg Film Fund.\n\nThe festival had featured 20 films, 3 photographic exhibitions by Luxembourg-based photographer Fabrizio Maltese, public installations, virtual reality works, performances and events from Luxembourg as part of an homage to the grand duchy.\n\nAs well as Plus que Jamais in the feature film competition, Fabrizio Maltese’s L’invitation (Red Lion) and Karolina Markiewicz & Pascal Piron’s Les témoins vivants had been included in the documentary competition, which was won by Rafiki Fariala’s Nous, Étudiants! (We, Students!) about life at the University of Bangui, Central African Republic.\n\nIn addition, Alexis Juncosa, artistic director of Luxembourg City Film Festival was part of the jury that awarded the Films du Québec prize to Respire by Onur Karaman."
