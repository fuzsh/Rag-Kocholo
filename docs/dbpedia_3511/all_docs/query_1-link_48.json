A sensitive boy with a vivid imagination, Felix is afraid of everything. Little by little, his imaginary demons begin to mirror those of the truly disturbing world around him. Felix's story continues as part of Philippe Lesage's subsequent feature, GENESE (GENESIS), also available from Film Movement."
