His girlfriend, Carly, tries desperately to help Leo overcome his psychological disorder,\n\nwhile unaware that the true reason he can’t face the outside world has everything to do with her own past. A complex and dramatic love story full of emotion and betrayal.\n\nNothing Really Matters received its world premiere at the 2008 Montreal World Film Festival. Yannick Bisson and Pascale Bussières play an unforgettable couple."
