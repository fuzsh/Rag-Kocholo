        "text": "The Five Senses is a poignant drama pivoting around the five senses  touch, taste, hearing, smell, vision  and the lives of numerous characters, each searching for a significant and intimate human connection. The story takes place over an intense three-day period in which a young child has disappeared, galvanizing the public and the media’s attention. Against this dramatic backdrop, five characters, who live and/or work in the same building across from the park where the child disappeared, are engaged in their own personal crises. During the course of the film, each of these characters discovers an essential clue to his or her own true desires. As the story of the missing girl is resolved, so are the stories of these five characters. The Five Senses reminds us that we are only connected to the world through our significant relationships. It is a film about having the courage to trust in life and love."
