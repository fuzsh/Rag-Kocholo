So, people from that community, including Monnet’s cousins, will be able to watch Bootlegger when it’s shown on the outdoor terrace of the Ottawa Art Gallery.\n\n“We hardly ever see the Outaouais region on screen. I was really happy to be able to film that land,” Monnet says of her decision to film in the community where her mother is from.\n\nMonnet likens making a film to “running a marathon” and says it takes her five years to write, direct and produce one. In the case of Bootlegger, she began work on its script in 2015 and shot the film during the fall of 2019 in Kitigan Zibi, Montreal and Oka.\n\nWhile Monnet’s previous work includes about a dozen short films, including documentaries and experimental films, Bootlegger is her first full-length narrative story.\n\nThe film tells the story of Mani, a young woman returning to the remote northern Quebec community where she grew up. Played by Kahnawake-born actress Devery Jacobs of the TV series Reservation Dogs, Mani becomes involved in the debate surrounding a referendum on allowing the free sale of alcohol. Mani meets Laura, a bootlegger played by Québécoise actress Pascale Bussières, who profits under the protection of the community council. The two women’s stances divide the community.\n\nArticle content\n\nAdvertisement 3\n\nStory continues below\n\nThis advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\n\nArticle content\n\n“The film is about resilience and determination and how the Indian Act that’s still governing Indigenous communities today is affecting families across generations. Alcohol is just an excuse to talk about that,” Monnet says.\n\nMonnet says Indigenous stories have often been told by non-Indigenous filmmakers. “It was important to me to bring an authentic take on things that’s filled with love, showing the harsh reality, but in a soothing way.”\n\nBootlegger, with dialogue in Anishinabemowin and French and English subtitles, was released last year. Pandemic circumstances unfortunately meant that the film, which features music by Inuk throat singer Tanya Tagaq and Toronto-based drummer Jean Martin, was not shown widely in theatres.\n\nIt has, however, played the festival circuit, picking up awards. Bootlegger premiered at last year’s Vancouver International Film Festival, where it garnered Monnet the prize for best emerging filmmaker.\n\nAt the 2021 imagineNATIVE Film and Media Arts Festival in Toronto, Bootlegger won the best dramatic feature prize. Monnet calls that win “the most important award … The community loves the film and sees it as something authentic and compelling.”\n\nBootlegger also won this year’s Iris Prize in Quebec for the most successful film outside the province.\n\nAdvertisement 4\n\nStory continues below\n\nThis advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\n\nArticle content\n\nWe apologize, but this video has failed to load.\n\nTry refreshing your browser, or\n\ntap here to see other videos from our team.\n\nMonnet says it was important that the Kitigan Zibi community saw Bootlegger before anyone else. Before its festival run, the film was shown more than a year ago at a summer drive-in screening in the community.\n\n“People were in their trucks. There was a lot of honking. I was nervous,” Monnet says.\n\nWhile Monnet studied sociology and communications at the University of Ottawa, she quickly found her way as a visual artist and filmmaker.\n\n“I do think artists and filmmakers are a bit like sociologists. We have to respond to the world around us. We have to propose dialogue,” Monnet says. “My work always has a big social component to it.”\n\nShe says that, rather than divide her time between visual arts and cinema, she does them simultaneously. “I just love both worlds and both mediums,” she says.\n\n“The visual arts keeps me on my toes and stimulates me creatively. I don’t want to choose between one or the other. I’m really invested in both.”\n\nIn 2020, Monnet was a winner of the $25,000 Sobey Art Award in recognition of her multidisciplinary work.\n\nShe is to arrive Friday in Ottawa, two days after the Asinabka Festival of Indigenous arts begins.\n\nAdvertisement 5\n\nStory continues below\n\nThis advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\n\nArticle content\n\nThe festival, marking its 11th year of supporting Indigenous-made film, video, media art, music and performance, “has its own signature,” Monnet says.\n\nShe notes that the festival has an international breadth, showcasing works by Indigenous artists from around the globe. This year’s edition will feature artists from Canada, the United States, Chile, Mexico, Venezuela and New Zealand plus films from Australia, Malaysia, Norway and the Philippines.\n\n“It becomes a hub for exchange and for dialogue around Indigenous issues,” says Monnet, who looks forward to catching films Saturday in advance of her festival-closing presentation. Each day of films features five or more screenings.\n\n“It’s a place where you can discover works you wouldn’t see anywhere else,” she says.\n\nAsinabka Film and Media Arts Festival\n\nWhat: in-person and online festival of Indigenous-made film, video, media art, music and performance\n\nWhen: Aug. 10-14\n\nWhere: Ottawa Art Gallery, Club Saw, Gallery 101\n\nSchedule and information: asinabkafestival.org\n\nTickets: eventbrite.ca, search for “Asinabka”\n\nBootlegger\n\nWhat: 81-minute award-winning film shot largely in Kitigan Zibi\n\nWhen: Aug. 14, 9:45 p.m.\n\nWhere: Ottawa Art Gallery outdoor terrace\n\nphum@postmedia.com\n\nArticle content\n\nShare this article in your social network\n\nLatest National Stories"
