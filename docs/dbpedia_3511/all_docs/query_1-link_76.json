        "text": "September 26, 2017\n\nIn keeping with its commitment to arts and culture, Quebecor is proud to support the Festival du nouveau cinéma (FNC) for the 9th consecutive year. This year, the film fest will be held in Montréal from October 4 to 15. Quebecor will also present the prestigious Louve d’Or, accompanied by a $15,000 award, to the best feature film in the International Competition.\n\nYear after year, the FNC’s outstanding line-up of films and the buzz around the festival put Montréal and Québec on the international cinematic map. Moreover, we will have the chance, thanks to the FNC, to see this year the Canadian premiere of Denis Villeneuve’s highly anticipated new film, Blade Runner 2049. It is a pleasure and an honour for us to support this event which is eagerly anticipated by Québec film buffs and filmmakers every year.\n\nIn addition to providing financial backing, Quebecor will mount a large-scale promotional campaign for the FNC in its media outlets. As well, Éléphant: The memory of Québec cinema, a major philanthropic project funded by Quebecor, will present a restored version of Denis Villeneuve’s first feature film, Un 32 août sur terre (1998), at the festival. The movie starring Pascale Bussières and Alexis Martin will be screened on Sunday, October 15 at 3 p.m. at the Cineplex Odeon Quartier Latin."
