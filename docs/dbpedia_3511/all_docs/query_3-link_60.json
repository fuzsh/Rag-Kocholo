        "text": "This ranking of Denis Villeneuve's movies will eventually include Dune 3, as the threequel has been confirmed as Villeneuve's next movie and has even landed a release date.\n\nIt's hardly a surprise, given the box office success of Dune: Part Two (which is now available to watch on Max in the US). The Canadian director, one of Hollywood's top filmmakers, will stay in Arrakis for a little longer while his legacy keeps expanding.\n\nFor now, though, we've taken on the foolish task of trying to rank all of Denis Villeneuve's movies from worst to best.\n\nKnown for his stunning visuals, twisty narratives and emotionally affecting stories, the director has become an essential name for moviegoers. From his early Canadian works to acclaimed movies like Sicario and Blade Runner 2049, Villeneuve has rarely missed the shot.\n\nIn an interview with Digital Spy , Villeneuve opened up about balancing the need for commercial success in Hollywood with the willingness to protect his artistic vision.\n\n\"I made Dune and Dune: Part Two with the will to make movies that I would have loved when I was 12 years old. I tried to make immersive, compelling and generous movies. It was my will to do so right at the beginning. I didn’t compromise my vision, my vision was to make movies this way.\"\n\nIn that balance lies his greatness as a filmmaker in Hollywood – Villeneuve's movies are accessible to wider audiences, but they can also be thought-provoking and risky.\n\nYou probably won't agree with our ranking, but that's the beauty of cinema, and when it comes to a filmmaker like Villeneuve – much like with Christopher Nolan – there's not really a bad movie to be found."
