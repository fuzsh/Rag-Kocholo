Pascale Bussières shot to fame in the role of Chantal in 1984’s Sonatine when she was just 16 years old. It brought her a Best Actress nomination at the 1985 Genie Awards. In 1994 she was given the Metro Star award as the Most Popular Actress in Québec following her starring role as Blanche Pronovost in the television mini-series, Blanche which became one of the most-watched programs ever broadcast in Québec. Bussières was given the coveted Jutra Award for best actress for her role as Alys Robi in the 2004 film, Ma vie en cinémascope. Interviewed by The Montreal Mirror in 2005, Bussières talked about her work in film. “I’ve never been a careerist,” she said. “I guess that’s because of the way cinema came to me. I didn’t have to fight a lot to get there; it just happened by chance. I would wait for the call to come and it always came. And now, 25 years later, I feel I have to fight a little more to get what I want and that’s fine. I’m ready to do that.”
