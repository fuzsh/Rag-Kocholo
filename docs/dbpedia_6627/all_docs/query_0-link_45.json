        "text": "ARCADE MODE\n\nBasic rules\n\nThe player takes control of a Cannon and uses it to fight off the oncoming Invaders. Once a wave is destroyed, a new wave of invaders will appear. If the Cannon collides with an Invader or one of their shots, or the Invaders reach the bottom of the screen triggering an \"Invasion\", the player loses one life. Once all a player's lives are gone, it's game over.\n\nPAUSE\n\nPressing the ESC or backspace key during the game will stop the game and display the pause menu. Pressing either key once more will resume the game.\n\nRESUME GAME\n\nResume the game.\n\nRESTART\n\nRestart from the beginning of the stage.\n\n*Your score will be reset.\n\n*Pre-restart score will not be registered on leaderboards.\n\nQUIT\n\nQuit and return to the title screen.\n\nSETTINGS\n\nChange screen and sound settings.\n\nCONTROLS\n\nView the keyboard controls.\n\nScreen Layout\n\n① STAGE\n\nThe current stage.\n\n② WAVES\n\nThe current wave/total number of waves.\n\n③ RATE & RATE GAUGE\n\nThe current rate (multiplier) and gauge.\n\n④ CHAIN & CHAIN GAUGE\n\nThe current chain number and gauge.\n\n⑤ SHOT LEVEL\n\nThe current shot level.\n\n⑥ CANNON STOCK\n\nNumber of remaining cannons (lives).\n\n⑦ SCORE\n\nThe current score.\n\n⑧ FEATURE PANEL\n\nThe current status of the features.\n\n⑨ POWER GAUGE\n\nThe remaining time for any power-ups collected or rewarded from fever.\n\n⑩ LAMP\n\nAny bonuses completed will be lit.\n\n⑪ CANNON\n\nThe player's craft.\n\nRESULT\n\nUpon completing a stage, the result screen will be displayed, and various bonuses will be rewarded dependent on performance. Achieving A or S ranks gives access to more stages to select from.\n\n① UFOS\n\nNumber of UFOs shot down.\n\n② FEATURES\n\nNumber of completed features.\n\n③ MAX CHAINS\n\nMaximum number of chains.\n\n④ CANNONS\n\nNumber of lives remaining.\n\n⑤ BREAKS\n\nNumber of breaks achieved.\n\n⑥ FEVER\n\nNumber of times fever achieved.\n\n⑦ ROUTE BONUS\n\nA bonus rewarded for the final stage.\n\nMID-POINT SAVE\n\nArcade Mode automatically saves player progress just after the result screen. However, there is only one save slot, so choosing Continue from Arcade Mode will restart the game from the where the last play session ended.\n\nCONTINUE\n\nAllows the game to be continued after all cannons have been lost. However, the score will be reset and will not be registered on the leaderboards.\n\nRESTART\n\nRestart from the beginning of the stage.\n\nNB: Your score will be reset.\n\n*Pre-restart score will not be registered on leaderboards.\n\nWORLD RANKING\n\nOnce the game has been completed or upon game over, the total score is ranked and recorded on the leaderboards.\n\nGAME MECHANICS\n\nSHOT LEVEL\n\nThe cannon levels up as the score increases, powering up the shot at the same time. However, a level is lost each time the cannon is destroyed.\n\nCHAIN\n\nDestroying invaders and UFOs in succession is called a chain. The chain increases with every enemy destroyed before the chain gauge runs out.\n\nWhile chaining, a chain icon will appear beside the cannon.\n\nRATE\n\nDestroying invaders increases the rate gauge and adds 1 to the multiplier when the gauge is full. The gauge gradually decreases the chain is broken. Rate is reset once a stage is finished.\n\nBREAK\n\nBreaks occur every time a chain of 100 is reached and temporarily grant a 16x rate.\n\nFEATURE\n\nFeature refers to a 'hand' which is completed by shooting down invaders in a certain order (same colour, type). The order is displayed on the feature panel. However this is only displayed before a feature is about to be completed and disappears upon failure.\n\nPOWER-UP FEATURE\n\nA power-up feature is completed by destroying 4 invaders of the same colour which triggers a power-up item drop.\n\nROUND FEATURE\n\nCompleting 2 power-up features in a row with different colours triggers a round feature, and the appearance of a flashing UFO. Shooting this down will start a bonus round.\n\nCHANGE TO UFO\n\nDestroying 8 octopus in a row completes the change to UFO feature and all invaders on screen are changed to UFOs.\n\nROULETTE FEATURE\n\nDestroying 4 squids in a row followed by 4 crabs triggers the roulette feature and the appearance of a roulette UFO.\n\nROUND\n\nShooting down a flashing UFO stops the game and takes the player to a bonus round. During a round, the player must complete one of several mini games within a set time. Successfully completing a round restarts the game in fever.\n\nFEVER\n\nSuccessful completion of a round restarts the game in fever. During fever, the cannon is given a powered-up weapon, making destroying waves much easier.\n\nA bonus is added to the score depending on how many invaders are shot down during fever. After a fixed amount of time, fever will end.\n\nJACKPOT\n\nA jackpot bonus is rewarded for shooting down a white/yellow flashing jackpot UFO during fever. A super jackpot bonus is available for shooting down a yellow/purple flashing UFO.\n\nLAMP\n\nThe lamps in the background light up upon shooting certain invaders in the correct order.\n\nCOLUMN\n\nDestroy a 4 or more invaders in a vertical line.\n\nROW\n\nDestroy a 6 or more invaders in a horizontal row.\n\nSAME COLOR\n\nDestroy 10 or more invaders in a row of the same color.\n\nSAME SHAPE\n\nDestroy 10 or more invaders in a row of the same shape.\n\nROULETTE\n\nShooting down a roulette UFO stops the game and takes the player to an invader roulette. A well-timed shot is needed."
