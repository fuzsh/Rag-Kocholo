The gameplay features similar elements to Toy Story: The Video Game; but the elements and graphics are more enhanced, and Moe can move faster than Sheriff Woody can. Gameplay is also similar to the Mario & Luigi RPG series, such as the fact that Moe and Aaron can team up to create a special attack and that each character has a specific special move and whatnot as well as bosses."
