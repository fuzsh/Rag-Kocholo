        "text": "Online Features of Massively Multiplayer Game (MMOG) ‘The Mummy’ Will be Developed on Top of High Performance Socket Server and Development Framework Exit Games Photon\n\n(Portland, USA) – June, 2010 –– Exit Games, the leading provider of multi-platform online game engines and services, today announced that its network engine, Photon, has been selected by the global leader in browser-based gaming, Bigpoint (http://bigpoint.com). Photon was chosen to power the online features in a game based on Universal’s hit film franchise ‘The Mummy’.\n\n‘The Mummy’ MMOG is being developed by Schell Games, a studio led by game design visionary Jesse Schell, with Unity technology. Exit Games Photon perfectly complements Unity-based online game development due to its .NET/C# development framework and the Photon Unity Client SDK. When it comes to the development of large scale MMOGs or real-time games, Photon is the only professional middleware on the market providing UDP protocol support, binary sockets and an interest management framework.\n\nPhoton’s features are unparalleled in the market and with its latest MMOG interest management, binary sockets and UDP support, it is the ideal engine for MMO projects – especially in combination with Unity.\n\n“Bigpoint is quickly becoming one of the leading publishers of licensed games, enjoyed by over 130 million users around the world. For this game, Photon’s technology will help us handle tens of thousands of concurrent users on only a small number of servers. This will not only save us lots of money, but it will also help us to ramp up a hit game with a robust network layer in a minimum amount of time, “ says Dr. Jan Wergin, CTO of Bigpoint.\n\n“Before starting the development of ‘The Mummy Online’, Schell Games thoroughly investigated the market for a professional network middleware. We were impressed with Photon’s feature set and Unity support. We did our homework and we’re confident that Exit Games’ Photon is absolutely the right choice for this exciting project,” says Jesse Schell, CEO of Schell Games.\n\n“We are extremely proud that Exit Games Photon was chosen for such a fantastic and large scale MMOG production,” said Chris Wegmann, CTO, Exit Games. “That is a great example of what Photon is made for. We can hardly wait for the game launch to see Photon’s high-performance architecture being proved once more. Schell Games and Bigpoint really went through a tough due diligence process and at the end Photon was the winner. I think that tells the story.”\n\nThe teaser website for The Mummy Online is available at http://www.themummy.bigpoint.com/.\n\nExit Games Photon reference projects such as the golf simulation “World Golf Tour” (www.wgt.com) and the Facebook application “Paradise Paintball” by Cmune (www.cmune.com) are available to be played online. Recent clients wins are GuppyWorks (www.guppyworks.com) and Zero Fractal Studio (www.zerofractal.com).\n\n###\n\nAbout Exit Games\n\nExit Games is a leading provider of products and services for the development of online games.
