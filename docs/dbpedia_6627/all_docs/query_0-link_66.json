        "text": "——statement of the artist——————\n\nAfter three days of a steady downward spiral in public discussion of the\n\npiece, I have just given my agreement to the organizers of the Leipzig\n\nGames Convention to simply turn off the installation Invaders! While I\n\nrealize the dangerous precedent of allowing the lowest common\n\ndenominator dictate what is and is not a valid form of expression,\n\nunfortunately the current tone has totally obfuscated the original aims\n\nof the piece. While I take full responsibility for the uncomfortable\n\nambiguity of certain aspects of this work, it was never created to\n\nmerely provoke controversy for controversy’s sake, and unfortunately,\n\nthis is what the piece has now become. The American response to this\n\nwork has been, frankly, immature, and lacking the sophistication and\n\nconsideration that other parts of the world have so far shown the work.\n\nContrary to previous reports, I am an American, and it saddens me that\n\nwe as a people remain so profoundly unable to process this event outside\n\nof some obscure, but tacitly understood, criteria of purely anesthetized\n\nartistic representation. Due to these profound misunderstandings, I\n\nsimply feel that from an artistic point of view, the work has lost the\n\nability to have any valuable impact, poetic or otherwise. I have not\n\nbeen pressured by the Leipziger Messe, nor by the Computerspiele Museum\n\nin this decision — to the contrary, they have offered their support in\n\ndefending the right of artists to speak freely, and in whatever context\n\nthey may choose.\n\nAugust, 22nd 2008 Douglas Edric Stanley"
