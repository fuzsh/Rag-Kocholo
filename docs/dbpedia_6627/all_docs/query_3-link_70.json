        "text": "I killed the game's process using the Windows Task Manager, but that can't be the normal way of exiting this game, can it?\n\nYes it can... just kidding!\n\nYou can exit the game from the main menu, which you can indeed reach by pressing ESC.\n\nHowever, it is only possible AFTER you reach the inn (after having solved the first two puzzles).\n\nI'm not positive, but you might also have to talk to people in the inn before you ESC takes you to the main menu.\n\nI noticed that when I first started the game. It seems one needs to completed a 'puzzle' or 'challenge' first before the option to 'Quit' the game is available. Not to fret. It really doesn't take along to reach that point.\n\nBTW I used 'Control', \"Alt', 'Delete' pressed simultaneously to exit the game when I first started... that command is 'friendlier' to the computer. The 'Esc' key didn't work for me.\n\nI too found this incredibly frustrating. My friend's son was messing with my macbook and started up Puzzle Agent but after 30 seconds decided it was not his type of game. No escape, no cmd-tab, and I didn't know the Mac-equivalent of ctrl-alt-del. Ended up plowing through those first few puzzles and dialogue again, which was just annoying since I'd already played through it.\n\nI've just downloaded the demo and started playing just to see how the game is like. When I had to solve the log puzzle to get to the hotel, my brain was a little tired to think how, so I wanted to quit there, but I couldn't find any key to quit. I even couldn't bring the task manger (it appeared but soon back to the game screen. I don't know why), so I had to shut down the computer. I found this annoying and it certainly puts me off buying this game! Too bad, coz the FBI style of the game sounded interesting (I am a huge the X-file fan). Please Telltale game fix this before I decide to buy this game."
