        "text": "Hello everybody, I’m new here, I joined because I’ve done everything I can think of, but I simply can’t exit game mode in Blender 2.6. I was following a video tutorial, I made a cube, made it a rigid body, and hit “P” to enter game mode. The object fell, as expected, but then I couldn’t exit game mode. I repeatedly hit the “P” key, but nothing happened, so I tried numerous other keys, ctrl, shift, and alt combinations, but still, nothing. So I closed Blender and tried the exact same thing again, and the same problem occurred, so I closed Blender again, searched online, and checked my user preferences to see if I changed the input key preferences or something, but nothing worked. In fact, the whole program seems to crash, as the only place my mouse cursor appears are on the taskbar on the bottom and the bar on the top (not the one in Blender, but the minimize-resize-close one. I forgot what it’s called (EDIT: It’s the menu bar)), only allowing me to close the program and try again. No keyboard shortcuts work, I tried ctrl+Q in hopes of that working, but nothing happened then, either. I never used game mode before either, so I have no idea if this is a new problem. I can’t think of anything else to do but ask for help here. Thank you!\n\nIt’s worked in the past, so I’m guessing that I clicked another program window and now its having trouble going back…???..but the gameplay works fine the ‘motion controls’ and ‘add object actuators’ are working. The problem is my processor is working harder than I’d like for longer than I’d like and I don’t want to lose all of my progress. (LESSON: Save often!) I know there is a Quit.blend file saved if it crashes but I’m not sure if it will if I Ctl+Alt+Del or just Exit the program. Anyone on right now for a quick response???"
