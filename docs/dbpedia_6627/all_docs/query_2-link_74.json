        "text": "@gingerbeardman\n\nA valid statement. However, for me, it's interesting because of how the Japanese do business. There's a lot of etiquette and expectations unique to Japan, which foreigners can struggle with. Certainly with Henk Rogers he described a mild resistance to foreigners.\n\nJapan was very insular; during the Tokugawa period; pre-WWII (even post WWII; English language signs for tourists were only added post Millennium with the world cup; seeing another gaijin was rare generally). It was also a mono-ethnic nation. You rarely saw foreigners if at all. Other East Asian nations like China and Korea also have a troubled history with Japan, so you didn't see them overtly.\n\nI'm generalising, obviously. Based on personal observation, interviews, and what I recall ftom my Understanding Japan module from uni.\n\nBut broadly - Japan was very much for the Japanese. They exported or imported, sure, but modified to suit their tastes.\n\nRandom aside: JP doctors used to tell patients not to buy medicine abroad because JP medicine was specially catered to JP bodies.\n\nYou read interviews about Yamauchi, and he was mildly hostile to foreigners. Rogers earned his respect playing Igo.\n\nObviously foreigners were able to start companies in Japan, but they faced a set of unique local challenges in gaining acceptance from Japanese colleagues and consumers.\n\nThis is less to do with the games industry and more business in general.\n\nFor one thing, can you imagine starting a company and having to know Japanese or use a hotshot interpretor because so few JP businessmen spoke English? It's different to a foreigner going to America, where the language of business is English and everyone learns it.\n\nI find foreigners staking a claim in Japan and succeeding to be unusual and fascinating (at least up until after the Millennium).\n\n@Diogmites\n\nThanks! That statement needed expanding really, since both before and after WWII there were different scenarios.\n\nAfter the Admiral Perry incident the country did open up. And send delegates abroad to study how foreign countries operated. There was even consideration to adopting English. And they were part of the League of Nations, etc.\n\nBut when you look at all the sources for the last 200 years, there is a recurring feeling of otherness.\n\nRandom example: the term \"Galapagos Syndrome\" originates from Japan. It applies to phones and computers. JP phones and PCs were wholly unlike any others until later standardisation. Take computers for example. Americans, Brits, French, East Bloc, there was to a degree common overlap. A Yugoslavian could move to the UK and do well coding Speccy games (it happened). Japan? That's a whole other ballgame with different rules and set-up.\n\nI don't want any of this to sound negative or xenophobic. The Japanese are very warm and kind to foreigners. They're a wonderful and creative nation I'm enamoured with. But being successful there, in business, having come from outside the culture, requires special fortitude.\n\nFor concrete specific examples I'd cite interviews with: Jeremy Blaustein, Victor Ireland, Ted Woolsey, Joseph Redon, Henk Rogers, Jez San. Game Over by David Sheff. Possibly Kalinsky of Sega, in terms of how US/JP staff handle things - though Sega is kinda odd, given the huge infighting between depts.\n\n@Sketcz You’re welcome. I checked back and noticed you made the correction with no reply, and so i deleted my own correction reply. I thought it would be our secret, though i should have known there was an extensive reply incoming and left it lol.\n\nI actually was really into Japanese history long ago, for a time, and my two main foci were the Pacific theatre in WW2 and also Tokugawa Ieyesu’s reign, as well as the resulting period. Interesting stuff.\n\nCommodore Perry was, in my limited estimation, an ass, as drunk on ideas of manifest destiny as he was on the grog that fatally scarred his liver.\n\nI imagine his blowhard tactics did little for the already failing health of the then-current Tokugawa, Ieyoshi, who died of heart failure a month after Perry’s initial visit. Ieyoshi was a virile man who sired a total of 24 children, only one of which survived past the age of 20. This is telling of the hardships Japan was facing at the time, particularly the Great Tenpo Famine, whose wake saw governmental reform and lean times.\n\nI’ve never heard of “Galapagos Syndrome”, and knowing what i do of the Galapagos Islands as well as Japan, the phrase seems an apt title for numerous possible examples of ‘the otherness’ of the Japanese, as you describe it. Interesting that it pertains to cell phone and PC technology and i thank you for sharing!\n\nI did not take your comments as xenophobic. My current partner is half-Japanese, her mother and family are from there, so along with that, my reading of some Japanese history, watching of films and playing of games, has granted me some perspective on them, though without actually having ever visited (yet) , i rely on others to strengthen the veracity of that perspective.\n\nThank you for the suggested interviews and food for thought!"
