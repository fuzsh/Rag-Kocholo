        "text": "I stand by the belief that Square Enix ruined Taito unless I can be proved otherwise.\n\nWhen Taito entered the video game market, they were the premier arcade brand alongside Sega, Capcom, Konami and Namco. This is the company that provided the legendary Space Invaders, the timeless Bubble Bobble and the shoot-em-up classic Darius.\n\nJust like any other company, their quality output was mixed ranging from amazing to questionable. Regardless, they had a distinct identity in the gaming industry that should not be overlooked. During the transition from 2D gaming to 3D gaming, Taito became more experimental with their games to accommodate the changing landscape, the notable games that I can think of by them is Psychic Force and Magic Pengel: The Quest for Color.\n\nEven if their 3D gaming efforts were not as popular as their 2D styled arcade games, at least they made a creative impression with the games that they released. And to make sure that their 2D arcade games were available to play for a modern audience, they even went ahead and released compilation packs called Taito Legends and Taito Memories which compiled a collection of their classic games.\n\nSo when the news came in 2005 that Square Enix was going take a majority stake in the company, you'd assume that Square Enix, the company known for exploiting their intellectual property with more entries than you can count on both hands, to dabble and reinvent the Taito library? or for Square Enix America to localise Taito games as Taito did not have a localisation division in the west?\n\nNope. The only notable direct collaboration between Square Enix and Taito was the Lufia remake that bombed and Square Enix America publishing Space Invaders and Bubble Bobble games because god-forbid localising the other games in the Taito library. Taito has to rely on third-party publishers for that? that's pretty ridiculous if you're a company that's owned by Square Enix, a company that has direct distribution and localisation channels in the United States and Europe.\n\nThe only purpose that Taito really has for Square Enix is to be their arcade division in Japan. That makes sense as that is the foundation of Taito's business, but to discard the company wealth of intellectual properties is baffling. We don't even have re-releases like Taito Legends for HD consoles or ports by M2 of Taito games so you can't even make the argument that their games are no longer profitable for the modern gaming market.\n\nOne of my main issues with Taito-Square, and this applies to Enix, Eidos, and Square's own back collections as well, is that they've generally been bad about making their mid- and low tier stuff available. I can certainly get ports of Final Fantasy, Dragon Quest, Tomb Raider, Space Invaders, and the like, but what if I want 7th Saga, Lufia, the Secret of Evermore or Soul Blazer? There are plenty of easy ways to make them available if Square's not interested in developing a full collection, like Nintendo Switch Online. I'm not sure who's to \"blame\" for this, but I know companies like Capcom and Konami don't have this issue. Square controls a pretty significant amount of classic Japanese games at this point, we don't need them vaulting everything up.\n\nRight down to being by M2. Main issue is that there's games exclusive to insanely expensive versions of the collections, or even locked behind pre-order bonuses - and they're obviously JP exclusive right now.\n\nYeah, I was going to mention these. I'm sure the releases are quality, but going from the affordable Taito Legends packs to more expensive packs of less games with extras locked behind even more money is kind of rough. Like, I'd pay for the \"Criterion Collection\" of series collections, but I don't think this is it.\n\nMaybe I'm misunderstanding your point here but... they've literally been doing exactly that\n\nRight down to being by M2. Main issue is that there's games exclusive to insanely expensive versions of the collections, or even locked behind pre-order bonuses - and they're obviously JP exclusive right now.\n\nFirst off, the Darius Cozmic Collection's physical copies are being distributed by Strictly Limited Games instead of Square Enix America so that already tells you how much faith Taito and Square Enix have for any Taito property that isn't Space Invaders. They're willing to pay third-party licensing costs for distribution instead of sticking with in-house distribution.\n\nAlso, Taito Legends and Taito Memories contained far more games than both of those collections. This is a downgrade, not an upgrade.\n\nCan we please not shit on SE this year?\n\nThey're doing great this year actually....FFVIIR, BD2, Trials of Mana, and maybe TWETY 2.\n\nThat's great... but none of these games originated from Taito.\n\nI don't think that's entirely fair, Taito was still doing a lot of shovelware and relying on external pubs and licensing awhile before and a bit after SE bought them out. SE's influence wasn't really felt until the 2007 reorg which led to probably Taito's best console output in a decade (Space Invaders Extreme 1-2, SI Get Even, SI Infinity Gene, Dariusburst, Exit 1-2, Arkanoid DS, Puzzle Bobble Galaxy, Qix++, Legend of Kage 2, RayStorm HD, etc). After that and at the start of this gen things quieted down as Taito's consumer efforts shifted almost entirely to mobile but they're back on consoles now with some good efforts (Darius/Space Invaders Collections, The Ninja Saviors, Groove Coaster WWP, Bubble Bobble 4) and even a new western publishing partnership (ININ Games). Now's probably the best time to be optimistic about Taito in a long time."
