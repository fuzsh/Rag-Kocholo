        "text": "I NEVER leave reviews. Not because Iâm lazy, but I seldom feel the need to because so many games are the same. For the first time, I felt I was playing a game that challenged me, but without expecting me to dig into my wallet to proceed. Hints could have been written with better grammar, but it adds to the challenge. Either way, this was not easy. But it wasnât frustratingly difficult either, mainly because the hints were great and you only had to sit through an add. However, there arenât that many adds to sit through, so this game was well thought out and I look forward to more! Thank you to the developer. A genius and I wish more followed his or her path.\n\nSo I previously had this game a few years ago and looking through all of my purchased apps and apps Iâve previously had out of boredom, I saw this.\n\nI remembered it was a little tricky when I was younger and I had to use a good amount of hints, other than that it was fun to play.\n\nGranted itâs still very fun to play but back then when I first had it, it came with more than one level. Such as a vent level and a boat level and more. I know this is the same game so after completing this, I was a little confused to where the other levels went. I still donât know if I just missed them or if theyâre gone for whatever reason?\n\nOther than that itâs still very fun and tricky. Would recommend as a short game to play.\n\nI have always been a HUGE fan of all of Kotorinosu's games, 100%. I was very happy to see this latest game - Exit II, and the first half of it did its job of keeping my attention, but then I hit a snag once I got in the attic and as a last resort I clicked on \"HINT\". After sitting through the very loud, irritating, and completely unrelated cartoonish video game advertisement for 30 seconds, I was then rewarded with the HINT - back inside the Kotorinosu game, which was a solution to a puzzle/task I had solved 5 minutes earlier! I seriously screamed out loud, and was immediately thinking about how the older Kotorinosu games were not like this...\n\nAnyway, thought I'd speak up, and hopefully Mani will read this and make a note of it for future games... He's always been considerate of his follower's opinions in the past...\n\n(I truly still give this game FIVE STARS, but I only ticked-off 1 star on the review, to hopefully catch the eye of Mani better.)\n\n:}~"
