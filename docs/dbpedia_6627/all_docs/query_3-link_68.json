For example, I am trying to exit Super Mario Bros Deluxe and go back to the Big Box games wheel and i am not able to do that. I am not an expert and have been learning over the past few months. Your guidance will be highly appreciated. I would like to be able to exit the game using the arcade buttons and not a keyboard. My arcade buttons are in Xinput mode.\n\nEdited April 4, 2021 by ehsan1432\n\n3 hours ago, ehsan1432 said:\n\nI would like to be able to exit the game using the arcade buttons and not a keyboard. My arcade buttons are in Xinput mode.\n\nFirst, if you have not done this before, you need to set up an \"exit\" button. Seeing as you use your arcade buttons in Xinput mode, a xbox controller api, this must be done in the LaunchBox and BigBox controller automation configuration.\n\nFor LaunchBox go to: Tools > Options > Game Controllers > Tick \"Enable Game Controllers\" and choose your device.\n\nThen go to: \"Mappings\" and in \"Exit Game\" add a button or button combination.\n\nIn BigBox go to: Options > Controller > Tick \"Enable Game Controllers\" and select your device.\n\nThen go to: \"Controller Mappings\" and then \"Close the Active Window\". Again add a button or button combination to exit a game.\n\nFor Ryujinx to exit out of a game back to LaunchBox or Bigbox you need to copy/paste the following \"exit script\" to LaunchBox > Tools > Manage Emulators > Ryujinx > Running AutoHotKey tab:\n\nESC:: { SetTitleMatchMode, 2 WinWaitActive, Ryujinx Send !{f4} }\n\nLastly I must say, as I don't own a cabinet, I may not be able to help you with cabinet specific problems.\n\nThank you very much for your step by step guide. I did try it and unfortunately it did not work. I have a feeling it has to do with the game I am trying (Super Mario Bros Deluxe).\n\ndefining the “Close The Active Window” in Big Box helped exit from other games (Steam games with the exception of SFV for some reason).\n\nI believe the main issue is exiting the game and not Ryujinx. I think the script provided would take care of exiting Ryujinx back to Big Box. I would appreciate more help if possible\n\n37 minutes ago, ehsan1432 said:\n\ndefining the “Close The Active Window” in Big Box helped exit from other games (Steam games with the exception of SFV for some reason).\n\nYou should never close Steam (p.c.) games with the exit button, but rather through it's own menus.\n\n37 minutes ago, ehsan1432 said:\n\nI believe the main issue is exiting the game and not Ryujinx. I think the script provided would take care of exiting Ryujinx back to Big Box.\n\nWhen exiting a game (window) in Ryujinx, you would return to the Ryujinx GUI (game selection). In this case you don't want that. You want to return to LaunchBox / BigBox. That means you want to close the game (window) and Ryujinx itself. I myself had major problems finding a script that would close the game and Ryujinx at once. But maybe a few pointers:\n\n- Some people report that the don't need an exit script to close Ryujinx. To test: in LaunchBox > Tools > Manage Emulators > Ryujinx > Running AutoHotKey Script tab, delete the script.\n\n- Check in Ryujinx.exe > Properties if \"Run as Administrator\" is unchecked.\n\n- If this fails, try a different \"exit script\". For example:\n\n$Esc:: { WinClose, ahk_exe {{{StartupEXE}}} }\n\nI will try finding another exit script for Ryujinx that could work for you, but I would encourage you searching the forum / the internet for a script that works yourself.\n\nThanks. I am not running Ryujinx as administrator. It is unticked.\n\nthe new script worked better. It took the game from full screen to smaller screen. A pop up message came up asking if I want to exit Ryujinx.\n\nIs there a way to not have that pop up because I would need a mouse or a keyboard to click on that pop up message?\n\nVery grateful for this thread. I've spent most of the past couple of days trying to figure this out and the step by step guide here helped out. Although the script I used in running AHK was the following:\n\n$ESC::WinClose, ahk_exe Ryujinx.exe\n\nI had this in there already and left it there after following the step by step guide above. But I became curious if it would work without an AHK script. It actually does.\n\nAnyways... I wanted to post the one I did have in there for anyone who may want to try it if all else fails.\n\nThanks everyone."
