        "text": "Thanks for reaching out to the Apple Support Communities, Steinfeldone!\n\nThat’s a great question you have about closing a game you’re playing. You should be able to follow these steps to Switch apps on your iPhone, iPad, or iPod touch. This will allow you to exit the game and pick up where you leave off. You can also swipe up when you have the App Switcher showing to close the application completely.\n\nIf you are sill unable to close the game, check out this article If an app unexpectedly quits, stops responding, or won’t open.\n\nLet me know the results and take care!"
