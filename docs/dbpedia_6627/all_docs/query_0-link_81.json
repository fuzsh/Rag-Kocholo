The game traces its roots back to a Japanese company named Taito Corporation, which specialized in arcade games. In 1994, Taito released a game called Puzzle Bobble, also known as Bust-a-Move in some Western countries. This game laid the foundation for what would become the Bubble Shooter we know today.\n\nThe original Bubble Shooter game, as we recognize it, was developed and released by Absolutist LTD in 2002. It was a clone of Puzzle Bobble and quickly gained popularity due to its engaging and straightforward gameplay. The game was later ported to iOS in 2010 and to Android in 2012, making it accessible to a broader audience.\n\nIn 2015, a significant development occurred when Ilyon Dynamics LTD, an Israeli-based startup, acquired the Bubble Shooter IP from Absolutist. Ilyon Dynamics expanded the game’s reach by improving the design and gameplay, adapting it for mobile platforms like Facebook Messenger and the mobile eSports platform Skillz. This move significantly boosted the game’s popularity and led to a surge in demand for similar games.\n\nThe success of Bubble Shooter has made it a general title for all clones, and it continues to be a beloved game for players around the world. Its history is a testament to the enduring appeal of simple yet captivating game mechanics.\n\nMore Games\n\nSolitaire Windows XP - The object of this Solitaire is to use all the cards in the deck to build up the four suit stacks in ascending order, beginning with the aces.
