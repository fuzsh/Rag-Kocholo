        "text": "Year: 1984-1985 | Publisher: Taito | Developer: Taito| Original format: Arcade | Version played: Nintendo Switch\n\nThere was a time in my life when I dismissed laserdisc games as an inferior form of gaming; an evolutionary dead end in the history of videogames. And yet, I’ve always held at least a passing interest in them. In the mid Nineties I was thrilled by Road Avenger on Mega CD. Then, in the mid-2000s, I would listen to Retro Gaming Radio (perhaps the world’s first podcast, having started in 1998) and would feel an infectious enthusiasm for Shane R. Monroe’s love of Dragon’s Lair and the animation of Don Bluth. Years later, I’d try the game for myself via a blu ray release and die repeatedly, wondering what I was missing that prevented me from loving the game just as much.\n\nLaserdisc games seemed to be shallow in the extreme. Compared to the games I loved most, they lacked a sense of agency or even basic interactivity. I wrote them off as memory tests and barely worthy of the videogame label. And yet, my attention kept turning back to them. There must have been a reason I loved Road Avenger back in the day. There must have been a reason Shane R. Monroe – a man of otherwise good taste – loved Dragon’s Lair.\n\nEventually I’d get to play the original arcade machine of Don Bluth’s classic during a trip to Arcade Club in Bury. Playing the game in its original context, surrounded by other coin-ops from its era, the appeal started to dawn on me. This was a game from 1983… The same year the likes of Centipede, Elevator Action and Ms Pac-Man released. All great games but, visually, they were in the Stone Age compared to Dragon’s Lair. Not to mention, what most kids were playing in the home… The Atari 2600, the ZX Spectrum, the Famicom? Please…\n\nOver the years I’ve learned to appreciate that laserdisc games weren’t just impressive in their original context. As I age even further into my fifth decade of existence, as time pressures and responsibilities mount up, there’s something to be said for letting go of “hardcore gaming”, hundred hour RPGs, mechanically complex shmups or cerebral puzzle games, and just enjoying an interactive movie. What I used to think was a simple waste of time, I now consider a welcome distraction; a not-too-taxing way to spend a few minutes in the company of some great animation, before stepping back on the merry-go-round once more.\n\nJust a few months ago, my interest in laserdisc games piqued, with two new arrivals in my home. One was my previously documented purchase of an MSX laserdisc system, which finally allowed me to play Konami’s wonderful cowboy-themed game, Badlands, while the other is the somewhat unexpected release of the Japan-only Nintendo Switch compilation, Taito LD Collection.\n\nQuite why Taito chose to re-release three of its classic laserdisc arcade games after so many years is a mystery. Of the three games on the cartridge, two (Time Gal and Ninja Hayate) last appeared on a home console in 1997 when they were bundled together for Sega Saturn. The third game, Space Battleship Yamato, has never been released in the home before, as far as I can tell. Time Gal has a bit of a cult following, admittedly, but these three games are barely remembered by anyone except a very dedicated group of laserdisc emulation enthusiasts. What a treat for Taito to let them loose once again!\n\nNow as compilations go, the Taito LD Collection is about as bare bones as you could possibly expect. We’ve been spoiled in recent years thanks to the efforts of companies like M2 or Digital Eclipse, who lovingly preserve classic games with a suite of emulation options, extra features and extensive making-of materials. But Taito is having none of that. This is really just three ROMs slapped on a disc, with no extras, no historical context, not even a scanline filter or the ability to turn off the garish wallpapers that border the 4:3 display. Only the fact the three games feature HD footage, chapter skips for practice, and load in an instant make the collection better than faffing about with an emulator. But, you know what, I really do try to avoid emulators as much as possible, so this was a great way for me to sample three forgotten games from a genre I’ve only recently learned to love.\n\nNINJA HAYATE (1984)\n\nIf you typed “Dragon’s Lair but Japanese” into an AI game generator then chances are that Taito’s first ever laserdisc game is exactly what you’d get. The premise is almost identical to Don Bluth’s original. As the eponymous ninja you have to sneak into a Japanese castle, rescue a princess and avoid violent death as you go. With just a joystick and one button, you have to time your movements and attacks in response to the animated footage and if you get the timing or input wrong then you’re treated/subjected to a comical animation of Hayate dying in pain.\n\nThe animation was created by Malone Films, a division of Japanese giant Toei, and while it isn’t quite as nice as Dragon’s Lair, it does still give Ninja Hayate a polished anime-like feel that I imagine must have seemed cool when the English version “Revenge Of The Ninja” released in the west.\n\nThere’s a big emphasis on sword play, as you might expect from the theme, but apart from that, there’s not much that really sets Ninja Hayate apart. It’s fun to play through once or twice, but I can’t see it becoming a fond favourite. Unlike…\n\nTIME GAL (1985)\n\nThis is the star of the show and one I have previous affection for. I owned the Mega CD version about 20 years ago and more recently got addicted to the very well made Amiga fan port. I’m not the only one who likes Time Gal; she has a vocal minority of passionate fans who seem to like the character just as much as her game. Which is understandable. Time Gal’s character design is instantly iconic and likeable; crucial for this genre of game, in which your attention is hyper focused on a single hero at all times.\n\nAs Time Gal acrobatically leaps between hazards or dramatically draws her laser gun to fire, she exudes a wordless anime cool that just makes her so much fun to watch. This is especially true in the genre-standard death animations, in which Time Gal is depicted in a chibi style that exaggerates the comedy, makes the animation more expressive and takes the sting out of the death. It’s this dedication to personality that makes Time Gal, and not Ninja Hayate, the true Japanese response to Dragon’s Lair.\n\nOf course, the other element that makes Time Gal stand out from the crowd is its time travel premise. From one scene to another, you find yourself flung between wildly different historical or futuristic eras, so you might find yourself running from a wooly mammoth one minute and battling in a Roman coliseum the next. This keeps the variety of scenes extremely high and also means that the sequence of scenes can be randomised without feeling disjointed, as was often the case with other laserdisc games.\n\nAnother innovation in Time Gal is the multiple choice sections, where the action pauses for a few seconds while you choose one of three options for how Time Gal should act next. In a way this was a clever idea because it adds a more contextual set of actions outside of the standard four joystick directions and fire button. But it can also make the game feel like a bit of a coin guzzler, since two out of three options will always result in a death. I would have much preferred if these junction points were less pass/fail and were more branches for determining where the story goes next. But that might be asking too much of a game from 1985.\n\nThis small criticism aside, I found Time Gal really good fun to play. The character and variety make it a game I was happy to replay a few times over, which is surely what separates a great laserdisc game from the rest. So it’s worth buying the collection for alone, in my opinion.\n\nSPACE BATTLESHIP YAMATO (1985)\n\nNow this one is a real oddity! It’s never been released on a home format before and as a decades-old licensed anime game, I’m kind of surprised Taito bothered to pay the licensing fees to release it once again. I wonder if they’ve come close to recouping their costs.\n\nSeveral scenes in the game actually re-use animation from the 1983 animated movie “Final Yamato”, a film so epic it was released in a nearly 3-hour long 70mm presentation. The height of animated decadence! The rest of the scenes, particularly those that needed to be interactive, were completely new for the game, making this release a sought after curiosity for hardcore Yamato fans.\n\nSince the star of the game is a giant submarine-like spaceship, rather than a person, there are a number of gameplay differences when compared to Time Gal and Ninja Hayate. Directional inputs are much less common in this game and, instead, you’re more likely to find yourself aiming a crosshair and shooting at enemy ships in first person. This gives Space Battleship Yamato the feel of a more traditional shoot-‘em-up arcade game, albeit with incredible animation. This simulation feel was captured further still by an arcade cabinet that put you at the physical controls of a star cruiser – check out some rare photos here – but, of course, this is completely lost in the Nintendo Switch version.\n\nWhen Space Battleship Yamato does revert to traditional directional inputs, it does so in a more action packed way that captures the feeling of piloting a spacecraft. One of the best sequences is a high-speed shuttle chase through an asteroid trench that sees you push the stick in different directions to avoid crashing, while occasionally throwing in shooting sections to keep you on your toes. The first-person perspective and sense of speed in these scenes make the game an exhilarating test of reactions and reminded me of the exciting vehicular action in Data East’s Road Avenger.\n\nLike Time Gal, Yamato also offers the player a little more choice than the average laserdisc game. In this case, its four main chapters can be played in any order by selecting them from a menu throughout the game. In practice, I don’t think this made too much difference to me, but I can imagine that in its intended context it would have allowed arcade goers to experience a bit more variety on consecutive plays rather than suffering the repetition of the same opening scenes over and over.\n\nI’m not very familiar with the original anime, so I feel compelled to judge Space Battleship Yamato purely as a game, but I quite enjoyed my time with it and appreciated its various innovations. It’s nice to play an animated laserdisc game that doesn’t fall into the same old gameplay format, and I’m really pleased Taito went to the trouble of including it.\n\nSo what have I learned from playing these three classic laserdisc games so close together? I’m trying to use these games to understand what I get out of the genre as a whole and why I’ve become increasingly fonder of them with age. Partly I think it’s the historical context. This short-lived genre burned so brightly from 1983 and was already considered old fashioned by the early 1990s. As a kid of 1982, I probably would have missed out on them completely had the CD-ROM boom not prompted a few of the games to be re-released during my youth. Decades later, it’s fun to play through these games with high quality video – rather than the tiny, grainy Mega CD footage – so I can appreciate the animation and just how cool they would have seemed in their heyday.\n\nI’ve also grown to like how little gameplay there is on offer. The rudimentary reaction tests are just demanding enough that I can feel in control of the action but just passive enough that when I feel like playing something brainless, the option is there.\n\nUltimately, I think the best moments of the best laserdisc games are those that use the animation to convey a sense of movement and speed, combined with the controls, to make you feel like you’re immersed in an interactive cartoon. That’s why just watching the footage on YouTube wouldn’t do the trick. You still need that illusion of control. It doesn’t always work, especially when dying a lot can break the suspension of disbelief, but when you get into a flow, timing your inputs just right and feeling the rush of exciting animation under your control, I have to admit that’s pretty exciting.\n\nI want more! Sadly, Taito never made any more laserdisc games. So my fingers are now crossed for a Data East collection with Road Avenger and Cobra Command. Until then, it’s back to the Mega CD…\n\nEIGHT LITTLE THINGS I LIKE ABOUT TAITO LD COLLECTION\n\nFinally, let’s enjoy the awesome voiced intro to Ninja Hayate…"
