        "text": "Microid signs agreement with Taito to produce two new games\n\nMicroids has signed an agreement with Taito to produce two titles based on the Japanese developerâ€™s famous franchises, the company announced.\n\nMicroids has signed an agreement with Taito to produce two titles based on the Japanese developer's famous franchises, the company announced.\n\nThe two games, which are already in development, are developed by \"experienced studios\" and expected to launch in 2022.\n\n\"Microids international development strategy is going strong and we are proud to collaborate with Taito,\" said Microids CEO Stephane Longeard in a press release. \"We are delighted the Japanese giant fully entrusted us with the development of these titles. We cannot wait to unveil the two projects we're working on and we strongly believe they will surprise a lot of people!\"\n\nTaito president and represented director Katsuhiko Iwaki added, \"We have full confidence in Microids' capability to revive two of our licenses through the titles they will offer in the coming months. Gamers will be amazed to experience these games come back on today's consoles..\n\nMicroids did that interesting Toki remake that was actually way better than i expected it to be, and then you also had that XIII remake which was... woof\n\nI .. want more Darius, but maybe they can just give us a Rainbow Islands remake for starters ...\n\nso many gems on taito legends 1&2\n\nYeah, those were great collections. I wish Taito collections for modern consoles existed, but I guess we'll have to settle with individual Arcade Archives releases.\n\nAnyway, here's some Taito games I'd love to see return:\n\n- Chase H.Q.\n\n- Dead Connection\n\n- Elevator Action Returns\n\n- Growl\n\n- Rastan\n\n- Thunder Fox\n\n- Violence Fight ;)\n\nAnd here's a random Dead Connection GIF because it's a cool game that not enough people have played:\n\nIt seems that the game is so obscure that even Taito has forgotten about it, because it has never been ported to consoles :(\n\nMicroids did that interesting Toki remake that was actually way better than i expected it to be, and then you also had that XIII remake which was... woof\n\nI .. want more Darius, but maybe they can just give us a Rainbow Islands remake for starters ...\n\nIt s probably up to inin games\n\nIt seems that the game is so obscure that even Taito has forgotten about it, because it has never been ported to consoles :(\n\naw man, growl would be neat - that genesis port is pricey these days\n\nchase HQ is so good, i'd be all over that!\n\nand adding dead connection to the MAME list, cheers\n\nNew Sonic Blast Man, let's go!\n\nThis This This. I forgot it was Taito that made this. Sonic Blast Man 3 with 4 player coop or even a remake of 1 with coop. These games were charming as hell and I played the fuck out of it on the SNES when I was a kid.\n\nI'd be happy with anything that isn't Bubble Bobble or Space Invaders (not that those aren't great, but they're quite well covered for new releases at this point). Darius is fine right now too.\n\nElevator Action is definitely at the top of my own list. Can't decide if I'd like it to be a heavy expansion of the original idea (a la DK94) or just an update or new version of the original (though ultimately we already got that on the PS3).\n\nDoes Taito still \"handle\" Lufia, or did Square take over on that one? They handled the DS version after all.\n\nElevator Action is definitely at the top of my own list. Can't decide if I or just an update or new version of the original (though ultimately we already got that on the PS3)\n\nwait, which one was this?\n\nwait, which one was this?\n\nElevator Action Deluxe, which is sadly trapped on the PS3 ecosystem at the moment. Had a decent amount of fun with it, and you can play as oddities like Time Gal.\n\nThe series in general needs some re-releases. Elevator Action Returns is my most wanted for Arcade Archives, but even stuff like the Game Boy version would be fun to play again."
