LOS ANGELES (November 12, 2008) — Square Enix, Inc., the publisher of Square Enix® interactive entertainment products in North America (Square Enix), and development house Gas Powered Games Corp., (Gas Powered Games) announced today that they have formed a strategic partnership. With the commencement of this strategic partnership, development has begun on SUPREME COMMANDER® 2, a sequel to the award-winning real-time strategy series.

Additionally, Square Enix Groupâs foray into the real-time strategy genre is a significant expansion of its product lineup, largely known for its leadership role in the genre of role-playing games.

"We see great opportunities in North American and European markets, both of which are expected to be maintaining sustainable growth over these coming years," said Yoichi Wada, president and representative director of Square Enix Co., Ltd. "Therefore, it is crucial we create alliances with proven developers such as Gas Powered Games in order to serve these significant markets better by providing products and services in tune with customer tastes."

"Gas Powered Games is an accomplished development house that has demonstrated its ability to successfully create and develop intellectual properties," said John Yamamoto, president and chief executive officer of Square Enix and Square Enix Ltd., Square Enixâs sister company in U.K. "We are extremely excited to begin working with Gas Powered Gamesâ talented personnel and see this strategic partnership as a significant step in our efforts to bring Square Enix titles to a broader global audience."

Creator of hit titles such as Dungeon Siege®, and Supreme Commander, Gas Powered Games® was founded in 1998 by one of the game industryâs most imaginative and dynamic visionaries Chris Taylor, who serves as chief executive officer. "It is truly a great honor to join forces with as renowned a developer and publisher as Square Enix," said Taylor: "Everyone at Gas Powered Games is thrilled about this collaboration, and the results will surely delight video game fans around the world."

Details on SUPREME COMMANDER 2 including gameplay features, platform(s) and ship date will be available at a later time.

As the rift widened between those who ruled and those who were ruled over, a new era dawned: one of countless frays brought upon the world by those enslaved by their own lust for power.

Rush and Irina are the children of scientists researching the esoteric Remnants. One day, Irina is kidnapped by a mysterious group for reasons unknown. As Rush searches for his sister, the world is thrust into confusion while those who rule bicker over dividing the Remnants' powers.

With the appearance of a mysterious man who calls himself the Conqueror, Rush is drawn into this international intrigue. While battling with his emotions in the search for his missing sister, he discovers he is somehow connected to the enigmatic Conquerorâ¦

Into whose hands will the powers of the Remnants fall?

Captivating story: The war to possess the powers of the Remnants unravels in this epic saga.
