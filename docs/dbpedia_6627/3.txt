Exit started off as a PSP game developed by Taito and published by Ubisoft in North America switched portable platforms with a Nintendo DS called Exit DS. Japan got it this past January and it seemed unusual that no publisher was interested in localizing it. The reason is Square Enix, the parent company of Taito, is taking care of it. The ESRB just rated Exit DS with an “E” rating cementing speculation that it will see a release in North America.

Square Enix is aggressively publishing Taito titles, which means we should see the Legend of Kage 2 translated too. However, there aren’t any signs that Square Enix will publish Exit 2, the direct sequel to the PSP game. Strangely, an English version of Exit 2 is already out in Europe done by niche publisher 505 Games.
