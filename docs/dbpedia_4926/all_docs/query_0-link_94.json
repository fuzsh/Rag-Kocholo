        "text": "Lakeside Cemetery\n\nPage One\n\nLocation: on the east side of FM 102, just south of Eagle Lake\n\nEarliest known year of death: 1868\n\nRacial mix: white, Hispanic, and black\n\nSurveyed by Kathryn McRee and Robert Samuel Martin on May 4 and October 11, 1975\n\nAudited by Bill Stein, Elizabeth Schoellmann, and Joe Fling on April 30, May 7, May 13, and May 21, 1993\n\nNumber of known burials to date: 2400\n\nIf you have any corrections, additions or obituaries pertaining to this cemetery, please contact the volunteer county coordinator.\n\nDue to the generosity and thoughtful work of Mike Cooper, we have received over 2000 photographs of gravestones in this cemetery. They have been put online except for a few that need some additional reseach to identify them. Thank you Mike! Your work is greatly appreciated.\n\nNotes from the Nesbitt Memorial Library site:\n\n1. The September 29, 1868 edition of the Houston Daily Times contains a report on the death and burial of Thomas Scott Anderson at Eagle Lake. The opening paragraph of that report reads, in part, he \"was buried on Saturday evening, near the Lake, adjacent to the graves of the Confederate soldiers who died while encamped there during the war.\" As Ernest Mae Seaholm has pointed out, this is likely the origin of the Lakeside Cemetery.\n\n2. The middle section of the southern part of the cemetery contains mostly Hispanic graves and is often referred to as the Lakeside Latin Cemetery or the Latin American Cemetery. Persons buried in this part of the cemetery are designated with the code \"Latin.\" Note that there are Hispanic burials outside the Latin American part of the cemetery.\n\n3. One grave is marked \"Beloved infant Jane Doe Dec. 30, 1980 Mar. 28, 1981.\" This child was not the daughter of some family named Doe with a devilish sense of humor, but rather an unidentified child who was abandoned on the steps of the Eagle Lake Community Hospital on the day she was born. The infant was cared for at the Eagle Lake hospital, then transferred to Hermann Hospital in Houston, where she died. She was never named.\n\n4. Ida Jewell Kuykendall, who was buried on August 7, 1999, was the first known black person to be buried in the cemetery.\n\nGo to page two\n\nA\n\nB\n\nC\n\nD\n\nE\n\nF\n\nG\n\nH\n\nI\n\nJ\n\nK\n\nL\n\nM\n\nN\n\nO\n\nP\n\nR\n\nS\n\nT\n\nU\n\nV\n\nW\n\nY\n\nZ\n\nA\n\nAdams, Frank R.; born: Jan 27, 1883; died: Nov 4, 1952; (tombstone photo)\n\nSon of Albert and Lena (Frick) Adams\n\nAdams, Georgia; born: Jun 20, 1920; died: Dec 12, 1995; (tombstone photo)\n\nDaughter of Rufus Benjamin and Beulah Mae (Pirtle) Vales, married James A.
