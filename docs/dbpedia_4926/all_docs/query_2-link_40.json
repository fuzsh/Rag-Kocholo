        "text": "Each year, USC Gould awards the Frank Rothman Scholarship to an outstanding incoming student.\n\nThe scholarship provides:\n\nfull-tuition guaranteed for three years (estimated at roughly $220,000)\n\nan additional $6,000 stipend each year\n\na guaranteed, paid, first-year summer fellowship at one of the world's top law firms, Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom in Los Angeles\n\nRegular decision applicants to USC Gould School of Law are welcome to apply for the Frank Rothman Scholarship. To be considered, you must submit an additional statement (look for the prompt in the admission application) and complete your law school application by the February 1 priority deadline. If you plan to apply for the 3+3 accelerated Bachelors/JD program or our early decision program,Â you are not eligible.\n\nWe take a holistic approach to choosing our Rothman Scholars, with selection criteria including strong academic indicators (LSAT and undergraduate cumulative GPA) and other factors from the application that make the recipient stand out.\n\nFrank Rothman, JD 1951: A Legal Legend\n\nThe scholarship honors the late Frank Rothman '51, one of the nation's most respected sports and entertainment lawyers. His clients included the National Football League, the Professional Golfers Association, Warner Bros., Walt Disney Co., Paramount Pictures and 20th Century Fox. He also served as chairman and CEO of MGM/UA studios from 1982 to 1986. In later years, he worked as an antitrust specialist and partner in the Los Angeles office of Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom, where Rothman Scholars perform their fellowships.\n\nCalled a legendary litigator by theÂ National Law JournalÂ and often included on that publication's list of the country's 100 most influential lawyers, Rothman was admired and respected by colleagues, judges and courtroom opponents. He was especially beloved at USC Gould, where he maintained close personal friendships and advised the school's administration as a member and chair of the Board of Councilors.\n\nSteve Rothman, Frank's son, says the scholarship pays tribute to his father's lifelong devotion to USC Gould and serves as a reminder to others of his father's remarkable legacy. \"My father always asked that we do the very best we are capable of,\" Steve Rothman says. \"That is what this scholarship is intended to reflect.\"\n\nThe Rothman Scholars\n\nFrank Rothman was known for his influence in the halls of corporate America and across the entertainment and sports industries. He infused his practice of law with a spirit of always doing the very best he was capable of. One Frank Rothman Scholar is selected each year to continue that legacy. The successful applicant will be selected based upon strong academic indicators including LSAT score, undergraduate cumulative GPA across a rigorous course selection, and writing ability. In addition, past recipients successfully conveyed the ideals of Frank Rothman via extra-curricular accomplishments such as running a successful business, inventing useful devices, engaging in cutting edge medical research, and publishing books and articles. Many Frank Rothman Scholars have gone on to become successful lawyers, and business entrepreneurs."
