        "text": "California Gov. Gavin Newsom announced a moratorium on the death penalty in California, granting stays of execution to the state’s 737 death row inmates, closing the death chamber at San Quentin State Prison and repealing the state’s lethal injection protocol.\n\nIn an executive order, Newsom called capital punishment both costly and discriminatory.\n\n“Death sentences are unevenly and unfairly applied to people of color, people with mental disabilities, and people who cannot afford costly legal representation,” he wrote. “Since 1978, California has spent $5 billion on a death penalty system that has executed 13 people.”\n\nThe California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation lists 90 condemned inmates in the department's death row tracking system who were adjudicated in Riverside County. That figure puts Riverside County's death penalty adjudication rate per 100,000 residents above all other California counties with more than 200,000 residents.\n\nMore: Judge denies the appeal of death penalty decision for accused cop killer John Hernandez Felix\n\nMore: Death penalty an option for John Hernandez Felix in Palm Springs police murder trial\n\nCalifornia has not executed any death row inmates since 2006. Newsom has long opposed capital punishment but in recent elections, California voters have struck down both a proposition to abolish the death penalty and approved a proposition to expedite the process.\n\n“Our death penalty system has been – by any measure – a failure,” Newsom said at a press conference on Wednesday morning. “It has provided no public safety benefit or value as a deterrent &mldr; But most of all, the death penalty is absolute. Irreversible and irreparable in the event of human error.”\n\nIn response to the announcement, State Sen. Jeff Stone, R-La Quinta, questioned the legality of circumventing the courts and issuing a blanket moratorium and said it ignored the beliefs of most Californians.\n\n“Once again, the voices of the citizens of this state are again ignored and the consequences of crime are further diminished,” he said.\n\nStone, in a statement published on his Facebook page, said the moratorium is unfair to victims of murder. He referenced death row inmates and others murders he believes merit the death penalty, including the 2016 murder of Palm Springs police officers Gil Vega and Lesley Zerebny.\n\nAnalysis: Gov. Gavin Newsom takes a big stand on the death penalty. Will it cost him?\n\n“This news cannot be welcomed by the victims’ families,” he said about Zerebny and Vega.\n\nNewsom acknowledged support of the death penalty within victims' rights groups, but said it doesn't justify upholding the system.\n\n\"To the victims, all I can say is, we owe you and we need to do more and do better, more broadly for victims in this state &mldr; but we cannot advance the death penalty in an effort to try to soften the blow of what happened,\" he said.\n\nHe said he is uncomfortable with the scope of death row in California, which has twice as many death row inmates as Florida, the state with the second-largest death row.\n\n\"We are considering executing more people than any other state in modern history — to line up human beings, every day, for executions for two-plus years,\" he said.\n\nRiverside County Public Defender Steve Harmon said he was pleased to hear of Newsom's executive order.\n\n\"The death penalty has forever been morally wrong and too often unfairly imposed and I'm thankful to the governor for his courage to do the right thing,\" Harmon said. \"I continue to hope the death penalty will one day soon be abolished completely.\"\n\nCondemned inmates adjudicated in Riverside County:\n\nHere's a compilation of death row inmates who were convicted in Riverside County, as reported by the California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation, as of March 12, 2019, with synopses from various media outlets.
