There's still not one that he won't see, but the love's worries.\n\nVeu B00:01:50\n\nHello? Did I just lose?\n\nVeu A00:02:00\n\nYeah, you lost the, you won the Pete Holmes game, which is the first person to speak to without being. Uh, as to speak, but was that one of those? Do you all heard the theme song? Yeah. Yeah. Everyone said, well, and we haven't been able to put our finger on it every once in a while. Uh, I don't hear the theme song on my end. So it's just go silent for a while. Around the time I start to think, Oh, it's to say, Hey, is there a problem? That's when I spoke this time and the song it ended for all of you. And then I came in, uh, so awkwardly.\n\nVeu B00:02:39\n\nI say we, I say we Sally for us and just drive on. We drive on, man.\n\nVeu A00:02:44\n\nYeah, ride Sally, ride. Hey, hey, hey, everybody. My name's Doug and I love movies. This is Doug Love's movies. It's Thursday, June 30th, 2022. And you've already sort of heard from my guests. They are Rina Call. Hi. Frank Castillo and Pat Naswell. Hello. I took too long of a breath after Rina, that's why you chose. I was going to fly through all of them, like we're in front of a live audience, and then you all come out and the place goes not standing ovation probably.\n\nVeu C00:03:26\n\nThis is good. It's cinematic. There's tension. There's pausing, you know? It's nice.\n\nVeu B00:03:30\n\nI got your right. It's like there's a taught little thriller we're in right now. Yeah.\n\nVeu A00:03:36\n\nOh yeah, every episode is a thriller because, you know, it's a game show, and I write everything down with pen on a piece of paper.\n\nVeu C00:03:48\n\nOh yeah, edge of my seat, edge of my seat.\n\nVeu A00:03:50\n\nAnd so a lot of things go wrong. When I get the wrong sound effects sometimes, like, you know, if you get a right answer, I might actually accidentally go. And that's not, that doesn't sound like a right answer. So I get everything all messed up, but we get through it much like, you know, if you're playing, having game night and someone's like running the game, they can't always be perfect. But let's meet all of my guests individually and alphabetically, starting with She made her Douglas movies debut in Rosemont, Illinois at Zaines, and now, finally, because of the demand has been insane. Hello. She is back. It's Rina Calm. Hello, Rina.\n\nVeu C00:04:43\n\nOh, hi. Well, it's so great to be with you guys today in the internet.\n\nVeu A00:04:49\n\nYeah, where is your physical form? Where are you actually at?\n\nVeu C00:04:54\n\nParts Unknown is my official address, but right now I'm in Springfield, Illinois. I keep moving and I had a little album release show here last night in Springfield. My album comes out tomorrow. So very exciting. And yeah, I'm just kind of enjoying all there is to see in Springfield, which is mostly my friend's basement. Yeah.\n\nVeu A00:05:21\n\nAll right, well this is, you know, this gets released at midnight tonight, so tomorrow will be when people are listening to this. So, you know, from Friday, July 1st onward, get Reena's new album.\n\nVeu C00:05:36\n\nYes, please do. I'm very proud of it. It's called comedy, my last name, calm. You guys get it. It's an easy pun.\n\nVeu A00:05:42\n\nRight? Yeah. But rough to have to share in a audio format. Yeah, because the word calm, people don't say the L that they really, you know, in speaking it, the L is a tricky business.\n\nVeu C00:05:59\n\nYeah, I'm definitely, yeah, you have to really push for that L. I don't mind how people pronounce it. I just have a problem having to spell out my last name when I'm dealing with like customer service because that's never usually a very pleasant situation and they get a good chuckle just out of my name because it's usually the opposite of how I'm acting. Right. I try. I try really hard, but yeah. Yeah, I deserve to use it as a pun for my album title after this life of dealing with it.\n\nVeu A00:06:30\n\nAbsolutely. No, it said it really, it's part of your social media handles as well.\n\nVeu C00:06:37\n\nYes. Yes. Rina Calm on everything. And yeah, I was gifted with a very unique name. So, you know, my branch out.\n\nVeu A00:06:47\n\nRight. You know, we have a whole, I have a whole other show about names that we really, you know, dig into it. But just pretty, it's called my real dogs. But just briefly, is there a lot, is calm, a last name other people have, or did your family kind of invent it?\n\nVeu C00:07:09\n\nWell, okay, it's definitely people in my family have this name. There are not, there are not a lot of us. I feel like their Rina is in my family. It's a Hebrew name and Rina is also Hindu. So there's like a lot of Indian and Jewish Rina's and I've Stumbled on some Rina Calm internet stuff, but it's usually like an Indian lady doing meditation or something. It's usually my main.\n\nVeu A00:07:39\n\nThat's what I was wondering, is this about the last name Calm? Is that I've never heard that anybody else have that last name? Is that in your experience?\n\nVeu C00:07:49\n\nYeah, I think that the story with us was that it was like one of those like little Holocaust bloopers where they came around the boat. You know how it is. I don't know. I think my grandpa, he was on a boat on his way over from Germany, like when the US went to war with Germany, and he was like going to take rat poison if they turn the boat around. And so who knows his state of mind when he got off the boat, but they could have just made that up at Ellis Island. And he was like, maybe he had a shady past, but we've had a hard time connecting it to anything.\n\nVeu A00:08:27\n\nYeah. Well, that's a great thing about it is you don't have a lot of other people run around with your last name, you know, because in show business, it's nice to, you know, stand out and also not have the last name of somebody, you know, did something horrible.\n\nVeu C00:08:42\n\nRight. Right.\n\nVeu A00:08:43\n\nYeah.\n\nVeu C00:08:45\n\nYeah. So maybe in my actual family, somebody did do something horrible and that's why they hit with this last name, but either way, this one's clean. So I'm happy with it.\n\nVeu A00:08:54\n\nYou should think up, though. You should make up a long version of what the name used to formally be, you know?\n\nVeu C00:09:00\n\nYeah. I'm a hot calamity. Calm-a-nada, though.\n\nVeu A00:09:05\n\nYeah, like some sort of a Sally and sounding name or something. Calm-a-der-g. Yes. Seeing of names, Rina. Our next guest also has a name. And he is our ongoing champion currently. He won on the last show. So he's back today. It's Frank Castillo. Hello, Frank. Hello, Doug. How are you missing Bakersfield as much as I am? Oh, man, Bakersfield stole my heart. We really had a lovely time in Bakersfield.\n\nVeu D00:09:42\n\nYou know, one of the more lovelier times that I've been Bakersfield.\n\nVeu A00:09:50\n\nYeah, well, I've rarely been to Bakersfield and our next comedian, our next guest owns Bakersfield. Or is it just, which part of the California you do own, Patton?\n\nVeu B00:10:10\n\nUm, I own, it's weird. I own the eastern part of the central desert. So Bakersfield was able to wriggle out of that. There's some zoning stuff. So I've got Lompak. I've got, um, Oh God, what's the one? I have everything north of Bakersfield and just south of the big cattle ranch, that big one on five that everyone calls it couch wits. The horrible, uh, Oh, wow.\n\nVeu E00:10:34\n\nOh gosh.\n\nVeu B00:10:35\n\nYeah. That's the nickname for it, because you drive by it, horrifying. And, you know, so, look, I'm just, that's the locals. I got to get in with the locals, man. I got it, you know, when you're up there, you don't want to be putting on errors. So I got to speak their language, man. I don't, I don't agree with it. I think it's horrible. But hey, you know, when you're a landowner, you make concessions. That's what you do.\n\nVeu D00:10:56\n\nI wonder if they have an asteroids bloopers.\n\nVeu E00:11:00\n\nAll right. I just saved my head.\n\nVeu B00:11:06\n\nDid that video come out in the 80s with a chin conway on it? Was that what that was?\n\nVeu C00:11:10\n\nIt's blooper. It's mostly people just stepping in cow pies. It's real dark, real dark. They just kill the cow. Yeah.\n\nVeu F00:11:22\n\nMine's gotten him. You do have to ask, well, I done Benson. Thanks for having me back.\n\nVeu A00:11:32\n\nThanks for being back. And, uh, did you, uh, did you just get back from or just now have to go to some other city?\n\nVeu B00:11:42\n\nI just got back from Wichita, Kansas. And next week I have to go to Montclair, New Jersey. So that's my travels crazy right now.\n\nVeu A00:11:54\n\nYeah, you mean you have to go to meaning that it's. It's a long ways away, not that you don't want to go there.\n\nVeu B00:12:02\n\nOh, no, no, I want to go there. It's not for comedy. It's another zoning thing. The lamb that I own in the Central Valley, we're in the property office is in Montclair, so I have to go there. And Montclair is lovely. I'm happy that it's there, but I got to fly across country and just look at some black books and make sure that, you know, everything's only up and up. I don't know why they don't keep it in Lompoc, but it's in Montclair. Some kind of security thing.\n\nVeu A00:12:29\n\nI heard that they don't have Zoom and New Jersey, so you can't do it now.\n\nVeu B00:12:35\n\nYeah, exactly. Yeah, thanks. Thanks, local commissioner. It really hurts. It really hurts the small businessman.\n\nVeu A00:12:44\n\nHe outlawed it because he does all of his business meetings with no pants.\n\nVeu B00:12:51\n\nYes. I mean, God damn it, I'm just trying to grow my almonds, and I got to go out to Montclair, it's ridiculous.\n\nVeu A00:13:02\n\nWell, thank you for being here, Pat, and that's great to schedule you have. And that Wichita was fun. That crowd was fun, weren't they?\n\nVeu B00:13:11\n\nWichita was great. Wichita, I was in Lincoln, Nebraska, and then Wichita, Kansas, and they were both fantastic.\n\nVeu E00:13:19\n\nRight?\n\nVeu B00:13:19\n\nIsn't it so much fun? Yeah, I love Wichita and I, and I love Lincoln, Nebraska was cool.\n\nVeu E00:13:25\n\nYeah, it doesn't feel like it should be, but then it is. It's great.\n\nVeu B00:13:29\n\nYou go to these little so-called, oh, you're in Kansas, a good luck. I mean, you have some of the best sets of your life out there. It's great.\n\nVeu C00:13:35\n\nOh, they love it. Lincoln is a super cool comedy city. They have really cool independent shows.\n\nVeu B00:13:41\n\nYes, they do.\n\nVeu C00:13:42\n\nYeah, I didn't. Zoolarius a few times on Sundays there. That's like such a great community that comes out for that. And yeah, you just say stuff that you're like, oh, Lincoln is super down to just, I think they appreciate it more than some of the places where You know, in a liberal place they kind of take for granted, certain material has less special. Wichita.\n\nVeu B00:14:03\n\nOh, exactly, yeah.\n\nVeu C00:14:04\n\nWichita is fun, but I've literally never had a normal time in Wichita.\n\nVeu B00:14:09\n\nWhat do you mean by normal? You had a bad time on stage, or the time walking around was weird?\n\nVeu C00:14:14\n\nWell, I've always been there when it's really hot, and the condo at the club there doesn't have windows, so I usually don't even walk around much.\n\nVeu G00:14:22\n\nWait, wait, wait.\n\nVeu F00:14:26\n\nIt doesn't have windows.\n\nVeu C00:14:28\n\nThere's not a single window.\n\nVeu F00:14:29\n\nI mean, what is what are you in a dungeon? What does the building look like?\n\nVeu C00:14:34\n\nIt's just behind the club. It's like in the same building as the the Looney bin. I don't know what's going on with any of the Looney bins. Now I've never really worked for them, but I've done some like Sunday shows at the Wichita location.\n\nVeu B00:14:46\n\nAnd you slept in the, apparently you slept in the conference room behind the loony bin.\n\nVeu C00:14:50\n\nThat's when they have a whole, they have a whole apartment back there. But it's, yeah, it's a very strange format for an apartment.\n\nVeu B00:14:56\n\nGod, that's weird. God, that's weird.\n\nVeu C00:14:59\n\nWhat's weird there? That's fine. Okay. I'm sleeping indoors. There's electricity, running water. Cool. No problem. You know, I can have a nice depression hibernation for a couple of days. That's actually perfect for my schedule. But then.\n\nVeu G00:15:10\n\nRight.\n\nVeu C00:15:10\n\nWhen it comes to like the audience there, I have like a great time on stage, but then there's always just like one person that's super unhinged, like wasted to the point of being a problem. Like a regular though. It's not like, oh, we got to kick that person out. It's like, oh, it's them. That's what they do here.\n\nVeu D00:15:27\n\nWe got to kick out Jeff.\n\nVeu C00:15:30\n\nYeah. It's like, that's their thing. We just allow it.\n\nVeu B00:15:33\n\nI was at the, I was at the improv two nights ago and I was, there was a drunk lady that I was doing crowd work with. And so, and she said her name and I went, okay, well, here we go. Like we're going to start talking. She's like, yeah, here we go. She was all excited and got up and sort of walked her to the stage and then security had to like get her. She goes, he said, here we go. He said to come up and they're like, no, no, no. He said, we're about to start talking to you. Like, oh, it was just, it was like dealing with a giant toddler. Yeah. It was like a 54 year old woman.\n\nVeu C00:16:00\n\nYeah, that's the brand. Yeah, that's that's spot on Wichita. You said, come up on stage.\n\nVeu F00:16:04\n\nHe said, here we go.\n\nVeu E00:16:12\n\nI can even hear the tone that you said. Here we go. Like, it's not encouraging here.\n\nVeu B00:16:21\n\nAnd I wasn't giving her away. Like, OK, here we go. Here we go. Here we go. Here we go. Here we go. Because she was just smiling. She just started yammering at me about something. I said, OK, well, here we go. Like I'm going to talk to her. She's like, all right, here we can. Oh, it was delightful.\n\nVeu A00:16:35\n\nDid they, did they tell her all the way out or just back to her?\n\nVeu B00:16:39\n\nNo, they made her sit down, but they had to keep going back to make her sit. She kept getting up. Again, like a little tiny sit here. Mom is going to fold some laundry and then going to get to that. No, no, no, no, no, sit down.\n\nVeu C00:16:51\n\nThen they just keeps getting up. Nothing like the idea of like a restrained audience member, you know, just like strapper down. We got jokes to do.\n\nVeu D00:17:00\n\nYeah. Yeah. Yeah. They're like, go back to your material. The whole audience is like, I can't wait for this bitch to talk again.\n\nVeu F00:17:06\n\nYeah.\n\nVeu C00:17:06\n\nYeah.\n\nVeu D00:17:07\n\nExactly.\n\nVeu E00:17:09\n\nIf you talk again, we're going to get the tape out. Yeah. Ah, we will tape it shut, lady.\n\nVeu B00:17:16\n\nYeah. I'm sure you've all dealt with the, oh, I'm dealing with a giant five year old right now.\n\nVeu A00:17:21\n\nOh, yeah.\n\nVeu B00:17:22\n\nFive year old mentality.\n\nVeu A00:17:23\n\nOh, we could be filled with actual five year old sometimes.\n\nVeu D00:17:28\n\nA week before the big slap, I had a drunk lady come on stage while I was doing stand.\n\nVeu B00:17:34\n\nOh, Jesus. What did she do? Did you go ahead?\n\nVeu E00:17:37\n\nGo ahead.\n\nVeu B00:17:42\n\nOh, I was asking, was she getting physical or she just wanted to come up on stage and be part of the show?\n\nVeu D00:17:48\n\nIt was a very, it was a very interesting day. It was like one of my aunts. Like if one of my aunts watched, we do stand up and had like, you know, things to complain about my act. Like it was, it was like getting heckled by my aunt. And then she like got up on stage and it was very much like a, she was also Mexican, but it was very much like a, oh, me. Oh, no, like kind of. He was like, what are you doing? He was like, stop, stop, and like, trying to take me off stage. Like, it was like, no, really? It was like a parent trying to like, like, no, you're doing something bad. You can't tell these things in the front of these people.\n\nVeu B00:18:20\n\nOh, so she thought she was helping you. She was trying to help your career out. Oh, that's so sweet.\n\nVeu D00:18:26\n\nYeah. So it wasn't like a bad. It was just like a protective. It was so funny. That is hilarious. We're just here for you. Yeah, and their husband has went through the drinks. So as he's walking back in, he was just like, wait, what are we doing? And then security guard's like, yeah, we're dead. We got to kick her out.\n\nVeu B00:18:43\n\nHang on, Rina, you talked about something about when you get off stage, there's always the one person. Are they just drunk and yammering? Are they like, I got a bone to pick with you, like they have something they want to argue with you about? Or what is it?\n\nVeu C00:18:57\n\nOh, I mean, and when I'm saying this, I'm imagining like two different women that I've met there. They're usually sexually harassing me.\n\nVeu B00:19:06\n\nLike, whoa, what?\n\nVeu C00:19:07\n\nYeah, I mean, like, and it's not just me. It's not true. Yeah. Oh, yeah, it happens. I mean, they weren't just hitting on me, like this one lady, but it's weird to talk about somebody sexually harassing you while they're also holding the mentality of a toddler level of drunk. So you're getting hit on by a five-year-old, but they look like shit. You're pretty.\n\nVeu B00:19:33\n\nLet's get married. Gorgeous. What happened to my yogurt?\n\nVeu C00:19:37\n\nYeah, I just, I don't know, I have a lot of people like aggressively trying to get me to like come out with them after the show when I'm like at my merch table and stuff like that, and I don't really drink, so I don't have like a, I don't know. I feel like I can talk for like an hour, make people like me enough to want to buy my merch, but then I can really ruin it in five minutes off stage. I'm not like the type to do crowd work much, but like talking about crazy audiences. I had like, I did a casino during COVID in Oregon. It was on the coast of Oregon. It was like the day that they announced that Biden won. And I don't know if you can imagine the crowd at a COVID casino was not really on board with that.\n\nVeu D00:20:19\n\nWas it a Native American casino, right?\n\nVeu C00:20:22\n\nUm, I believe so.\n\nVeu D00:20:24\n\nUm, they are all Native American, but like the board that runs it are all like those kind of people.\n\nVeu C00:20:31\n\nRight. It was I didn't see any Native Americans in there. It was definitely a lot of drunk. I had to be clean. Also, I don't do a lot of crowd work. And I did like a full hour of just crowd control. Like I don't think I finished a single joke and one table. It was like a group activity of ruining the night. And I had to do two shows and they stayed for the next show. It was a nightmare.\n\nVeu B00:20:52\n\nI don't whoa. Yeah. That's the worst.\n\nVeu C00:20:56\n\nYeah, like I couldn't believe it. I think at one point I just said out loud during my set like I have mental health problems like just to tell myself while I was there like it's like nothing's happening that's good here.\n\nVeu B00:21:08\n\nGive yourself a hug. Yeah. Yeah.\n\nVeu A00:21:12\n\nWell, let's take a break from this comedy talk and talk about movies a little bit. Let's try to wedge some movie talking. Let's do it. Why not? Movie podcast. And in episode lately, I like to ask my guests to recommend one movie. We'll start with Rina. OK, please recommend a film.\n\nVeu C00:21:37\n\nUh, I know that everybody's been recommending it everywhere, everything, everywhere, all at once is the best movie I've seen in my life.\n\nVeu A00:21:44\n\nBut it comes up a lot. And it's a, it's a solid tick. Like the fact that it keeps coming up, like the fact that you're saying it right now is not a, it's not a bad thing. Don't feel like, oh, everybody's saying this. There's still people out there that have not seen this movie or haven't, you know, been convinced that they're going to love it. You know, they don't have the hype. So I don't mind that being your choice today.\n\nVeu C00:22:07\n\nWell, I appreciate that. I don't go to the movies a ton and somebody had told me just to go see that without even seeing a preview or anything. So I went in blind and yeah, I mean, I've been twice now and I think it was like more intense to watch the second time even, you know. I can't recommend that one enough. Everybody should see it. It should be like mandatory emotional training.\n\nVeu A00:22:27\n\nWow. All right. Well, it's official. Everybody should see it. Frank, what have you got for us this time?\n\nVeu D00:22:35\n\nOh, man. So I've been on a kick of watching bad movies. Love it. Yeah. And there's a movie Ridley Scott put out. I think it was in 2014. It was Exodus, Gods and Kings. Oh, Christian Bale. Yeah, it's about Moses. And in Egypt, really, God does it. I swear to God, the cast is Christian Bale, Joel Edgerton. It's all white people. It's all white. It's a girl. It is. It's hysterical.\n\nVeu C00:23:12\n\nIf I'm going to watch a movie about the Jews in Egypt, it better be starring somebody named Christian. That's all I can say.\n\nVeu D00:23:19\n\nYeah. It was great. My wife's not very religious, so she walked in on me watching it, and she was just like, what the fuck is going?\n\nVeu B00:23:30\n\nLike, is there any issues? Like, is there trouble in the marriage you want to talk to me or is this finish this?\n\nVeu D00:23:35\n\nHe's like, are you converted?\n\nVeu A00:23:40\n\nThis isn't a competition, but you know, I don't feel like you're trying, Frank, because there's no way anyone would say they liked your choice better than everything everywhere or all at once. But I'm glad that you're pointing out to people how fun and funny that movie is. Uh, to watch and just think about that all these grown men got together and did that. Yeah. It's just, I don't, anybody making a biopic like Bible movie now. It's like, really? You want to get into those get ups and do that play acting about that?\n\nVeu D00:24:23\n\nThat's the story we need to retell.\n\nVeu E00:24:26\n\nYeah, it just it all just seems like why is it why is this happening? Yeah.\n\nVeu B00:24:31\n\nThey don't even show Spider-Man getting bit by the spider anymore. They just get right into it. You don't need to do the swords and shit. Get to it, man.\n\nVeu C00:24:39\n\nI will say, though, whoever deserves credit for this or blame that I really never knew the story of Jesus until I saw the passion of the Christ. And that was in my 20s. Like I just wow.\n\nVeu A00:24:50\n\nWell, that Yeah, that must have been an interesting movie for you to actually be learning something, but for everybody else is just drudgery.\n\nVeu C00:24:58\n\nRight. Oh, it seems like a miserable trauma to be reliving. Yeah. Absolutely. I don't recommend it. Yeah.\n\nVeu A00:25:06\n\nAlso, I keep getting confused in my head. I was thinking of last temptation of Christ, which is torture in a different sort of way. I mean, I don't think there's any movies about the Bible or Bible characters that I really love.\n\nVeu C00:25:23\n\nI like the Jesus Christ superstar. We used to play that in a Hollywood video. That's good. Yeah, that's fine. Yeah.\n\nVeu B00:25:29\n\nThere's a movie by Kevin Reynolds called Risen. That's actually pretty good. It's like it's the days after the resurrection and his Roman soldier. Try to go find Jesus and to prove that he died because they don't want him creating a cult, basically. And it's actually really, really well made. It's called risen. Good.\n\nVeu A00:25:48\n\nYeah, that sounds. I mean, I love Kevin Reynolds.\n\nVeu D00:25:51\n\nYeah. There's a book that I wish they made into a movie. I can't remember if I can't remember what it's called, but it's about Jesus and his best friend and the time between that he went missing, right? Cause from like 13 to like 20, whatever. That's right. Yeah. So it's just him filling in all those stories and you find out like Jesus just traveled the world and like met other gods. Wow. Yeah.\n\nVeu E00:26:14\n\nOkay. I'd watch that, baby.\n\nVeu C00:26:16\n\nYeah.\n\nVeu D00:26:16\n\nAnd he was coming to true. It's pretty hilarious.\n\nVeu C00:26:20\n\nIt's like a Jesus multiverse. There you go.\n\nVeu B00:26:24\n\nHey, the Jesus verse.\n\nVeu A00:26:27\n\nYeah. Do you want your movie to be risen, Patton? Do you want that to be your recommendation?\n\nVeu B00:26:33\n\nNo, I mean, you should watch risen. I think it's really what I was going to recommend.\n\nVeu A00:26:37\n\nSo that's the bonus recommendation. Oh, sorry. What have you got for your sincere Uh, they'll watch it right now. Recommendation.\n\nVeu B00:26:46\n\nWell, and this is my sincere recommendation, but there's a massive asterisk on it because this is a really, really well made film that I, that I actually part of me thinks maybe this shouldn't have been made. Um, it's streaming right now on shutter. It's a shutter original called, um, the sadness. And it is a, I believe it's a Korean horror film and it's a new take on the zombie genre. And you would think, okay, we've beaten the zombies into the ground. This is actually a pretty genuinely original, very dark, very frightening, very disturbing take on the idea of a zombie virus going around. Really, this guy knows how to make a fucking movie, but this is a hard sit. This is one of those movies where people are like, I'm a hardcore whore fan. Give me the worst. And then I feel like a lot of them will watch us and go, yeah, maybe I didn't need to see that. Well, like, it really goes where you do not think it's going to go. But it's brilliantly made. It's called Sadness.\n\nVeu A00:27:50\n\nOK. All right. I feel like this is really going to be. This isn't, uh, Rena's really going to run away with this one.\n\nVeu C00:27:57\n\nI didn't know it was a competition this part.\n\nVeu A00:27:59\n\nIt's not a competition, but it is. But people do vote. Yes, you know, just much, it's just like politics. It's not a competition.\n\nVeu B00:28:07\n\nOh, then I, then I recommend readers to the law of stark. I'm going to recommend readers to the law of stark. Okay. Good. That's a record. Yeah. Go see that. That's really good.\n\nVeu A00:28:14\n\nThat's an interesting concept here. Yeah.\n\nVeu B00:28:16\n\nI mean, your recommendations shouldn't change based on the fact that, uh, they actually go see the sadness with an asterisk.\n\nVeu C00:28:25\n\nA massive asterisk, which I think is a ring to it. That has a ring to it. A master, a masterism.\n\nVeu B00:28:30\n\nOh, you beat me to it. God damn it.\n\nVeu A00:28:34\n\nAll right, we gotta go to a commercial break and then play some games.

It's called that because the two of you, the two of you who know the least about Thor movies will be Thor Losers.\n\nVeu B00:31:22\n\nOh, brilliant. Okay. Love it.\n\nVeu A00:31:25\n\nI'll say a fact, fun or regular, and you tell me if that fact applies to Thor, the original Marvel movie of how many years back, or Thor, the Dark World, called Thor 2 in some circles, or Thor, Ragnarok. So it's multiple choices, and the options are regular Thor, Thor, the Dark World, or Thor, Ragnarok. And Rena's going to go first on this first... In fact, if she misses it, then Frank gets to choose between the two remaining options. If he misses, then Pat gets a gimme point. And each time somebody gets a point for getting one right, the next person goes first in the next round. Are you ready, Reena?\n\nVeu C00:32:23\n\nI mean, I'm just glad I started strong in the first half because I thought you said the number four. I thought it was for losers. Anyway, yeah, I'm ready.\n\nVeu A00:32:35\n\nThat's us. That's what I call this show, me and being three friends, AK for losers.\n\nVeu C00:32:45\n\nI was, yeah, anyway, I've seen four weddings and a funeral. Actually, I haven't seen that. Anyway, yeah, I'm ready. All right.\n\nVeu A00:32:51\n\nWell, you know, just use deductive reasoning and guess between the three options, you know, you can only be wrong one third, two thirds of the time.\n\nVeu B00:33:01\n\nOh, that's a good way to do it. Yeah.\n\nVeu A00:33:03\n\nYeah. And also, you know, you never know where, which way this is going to go. Rina, the fun fact is that the film is one hour and 55 minutes long. Between those three movies, regular Thor, Dark World, or Ragnarok, which one do you think is one hour and 55 minutes long?\n\nVeu C00:33:29\n\nI want to say the Dark World. You're going Dark World? Hmm. Yeah. No. Yes.\n\nVeu A00:33:43\n\nOkay. Dark world is your answer. That is incorrect.\n\nVeu C00:33:48\n\nOh, that sounded positive. The sound effect, but I don't know. It all sounds fun.\n\nVeu A00:33:54\n\nWell, this one sounds more positive, I think. It's always exciting when somebody comes to the door. Oh, yeah.\n\nVeu B00:34:03\n\nYeah, points are dropping by. Yeah.\n\nVeu A00:34:05\n\nAll right, Frank, she said, which one did you say? The middle one, the middle one, the dark girl. Yeah. So that means regular Thor or Ragnarok, Frank, which one of those is an hour and 55 minutes long.\n\nVeu D00:34:18\n\nSo my wife is a huge, huge Marvel fan, and we watch repeatedly.\n\nVeu A00:34:26\n\nOkay, so you must know this. Number one, first Thor. You're saying the first door is an hour of 55. Yeah. So that's the way you get when you get a correct answer.\n\nVeu B00:34:41\n\nYeah. That sounds genuinely frighten me. Oh, the goddamn doorbell and you do that. Jesus.\n\nVeu C00:34:47\n\nI will spit out my coffee. OK.\n\nVeu A00:34:52\n\nRagnarok is the longest of the three at two hours and ten minutes, and Dark Worlds is at hour 52, so it's just three minutes shy of its predecessor, regular Thor, predecessor. All right, so Frank is on the board. Frank has one point. Patton, you're up. You got to go first on this one. Okay. You can refuse between Thor, Dark World, or Ragnarok. Is currently available to watch on prime for $3.99. I'm going to say Thor Ragnarok.\n\nVeu G00:35:35\n\nDamn. That's incorrect.\n\nVeu B00:35:43\n\nSo the sound of an elf getting a boner means I don't get any points.\n\nVeu A00:35:52\n\nOK, Rina, you're up. You get to choose between. He picked Ragnarok. So Thor or Dark World is $3.99 on Amazon Prime.\n\nVeu C00:36:04\n\n$3.99 has real first film, like a long time ago, energy to it. I feel like they're still probably charging more for Ragnarok. So we're going to go with the original Thor.\n\nVeu A00:36:13\n\nThat is correct.\n\nVeu C00:36:15\n\nYeah.\n\nVeu A00:36:16\n\nWow. All it's about counting skills. Oh, gee, Thor. Well, it's interesting because, yeah, Dark World is for free right now on stars if you have that. And Ragnarok, I think just because a lot of people are probably, they're probably hoping for a lot of people wanting to re-educate themselves, remind themselves of what's going on at the end of Ragnarok. Because it's 1999. Yeah, that's right.\n\nVeu D00:36:39\n\nYeah, it's a torrent. Also, the second Thor is rated the worst of the series. Rated by who? Just just in general. Like this. I'm sorry. The second one? Yeah. Dark World? Yeah.\n\nVeu B00:36:55\n\nWow. I thought this is just my opinion. I thought they kind of flubbed the first one, and then they kind of got it together for the second one and realized, wait a minute, Loki's the fun of this. Let's bring him back and do some cool skullduggery stuff here like that. That actually made it kind of fun.\n\nVeu A00:37:11\n\nThey didn't make an adjustment there that ultimately I think they were, I think they got, I think the comedy still didn't fly in dark for me. It really started to come together in Ragnarok and then in all these other movies where they had where those guys happened to appear. To me, Thor, and that's why I'm excited about this movie, just on the face of it, just his behavior and where they've taken the character with this actor is just the funniest Marvel character to me.\n\nVeu B00:37:41\n\nYeah. Yeah.\n\nVeu A00:37:42\n\nYeah.\n\nVeu B00:37:43\n\nAnd you know, Thor in the original Marvel universe was so loony tunes. It was Kirby and Stanley and all of them just flirting with gods and like, what if an actual god, like a god from mythology is alongside the thing and Captain America? Like, why the hell not? So the whole thing was friggin crazy. So why not go crazy?\n\nVeu A00:38:05\n\nYeah, yeah, exactly. All right. So, Patton, you should do that and call it Thor Loco.\n\nVeu B00:38:16\n\nOh, my God. Damn.\n\nVeu A00:38:19\n\nYou're not on the board yet.\n\nVeu B00:38:21\n\nYeah, but Renee should be on the board like five more points just for that quip.\n\nVeu D00:38:25\n\nOkay. Well, I took the multiverse where it's all like Mexican superheroes.\n\nVeu A00:38:33\n\nIt's Frank, it's your turn to go first again. Okay, because Rina just got that point. Yeah, so Frank, which one of those three movies? I feel like you're gonna know this with your significant other being so into it. Thor says in one of those movies, for the first time in my life, I have no idea what I'm supposed to do. Sounds like a moment of clarity from Thor. You're going number three, Ragnar Rock. You're rockin' number three. Incorrect. Yeah, this is yours to win. Now, Patton could tie this up, make it a choice of three-way tie if he knows whether it's in First door or second store. I'm going to say it's in the first door. You're going first door, first door. He says, for the first time in my life, I have no idea what I'm supposed to do.\n\nVeu B00:39:40\n\nYeah.\n\nVeu A00:39:42\n\nAnd he's been confusing everything we've seen him in. Yeah, that is true.\n\nVeu C00:39:45\n\nDidn't say for the last time, you know, exactly the start of it. Yeah.\n\nVeu A00:39:53\n\nThat is the correct way tie in Thor losers. That means we've got to play a very, very serious tiebreaker. And yeah, no more messing around. Rina, you got to go first again. OK. And this time it's, you know, the first person to get it right. So if you miss it, Frank's got his time. If Frank misses it, then Patton wins this game. And there's no real big prize or anything for winning this game. Don't feel too much pressure, Rena. The tagline for one of those films goes like this. Courage is immortal. Hmm. For a dark store or a Ragnarok store.\n\nVeu C00:40:51\n\nOK, so I want to say Ragnarok because it feels like they're really stretching a premise with the immortal thing, you know? Incorrect. Sorry.\n\nVeu E00:41:07\n\nYes. What's that? I burped. I apologize.\n\nVeu A00:41:10\n\nOh, OK. I thought you were your answer. I thought you said I thought you said dark.\n\nVeu D00:41:15\n\nOh, no, no, no, he's in Burke. Yeah, he's in Burke.\n\nVeu A00:41:20\n\nYeah. So Rena took Ragnarok. I regret it. She does not. She wishes she had not done that. Yeah. So you don't want to pick Ragnarok. You have to choose Dream Thor or Dark World. Dark World. You're going Dark World. Have the tagline courage is immortal. Oh, my God.\n\nVeu B00:41:44\n\nIntroducing Fidelity Advantage 401K, the affordable 401K plan built for small businesses like yours.\n\nVeu A00:41:49\n\nIt's easy to manage so you could focus on your business and make saving for retirement a reality.\n\nVeu P00:42:14\n\nReady to learn more?

We'll have to kind of speed through our final game. That's how much fun we've been having. We're running out of time. But I don't think it's a game. I mean, it's definitely a game where there's some discussion, some strategizing, some sharing of information, and the game is called Weird Algorithm. It is based on the weirdness of the algorithm on the internet movie database IMDB. You can go there and you can take any motion picture or any project at all, really, but any movie. You can look at the cast list and then go, I want to refine this cast list, but have everybody listed based on their popularity right now. Uh-huh. Yeah. So, you know, like, you typed in, you typed in something like it hot, then refine. I bet you Marilyn Monroe would be number one, because she's still so fascinating to this day. Right. And then I don't know, it'd be a toss-up between Lemon and Curtis. I don't know who has a better legacy or gets looked up more on the internet. But it's basically the IMDB just decides, like their star meter or whatever, they decide popularity of everybody. So you can re-rank movies. So how this game works is I'll tell you the name of the movie. And then I'll go through to each of you one at a time and you will tell me what actor or actress you think is the most popular according to IMDB today from that movie. I'll even tell you people that were in the movie. It's not a game where you have to try to remember who was in it. And you can share answers strategically. If you have the same answer as somebody else, you're going to have the same points as somebody else. So you may not want to do that all the time, but you can certainly get close to a win and possibly the win by sharing with other people. Indeed. Same order as last time. But each time a different person will get to go first, reading his first and his first round.\n\nVeu C00:45:02\n\nI'm ready.\n\nVeu A00:45:03\n\nThe film is called, he's just not that into you. Oh, yeah. Quite a cast in that one. Lots of names, a couple of friends. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Actual friends, just one friend, just Jennifer Anderson is the only person from friends in it. Okay, there were coffee shop scenes. They should have had guns there in the scenes.\n\nVeu C00:45:33\n\nOkay, well, Jennifer Aniston, I feel like, has stayed pretty popular for however long. I don't know when that movie came out, but I feel like she's still very popular. Who is somebody I would be comparing? I know.\n\nVeu A00:45:47\n\nYou know, she's in a relationship with Ben Affleck in the movie. Drew Barrymore is in there, Bradley Coops. Jennifer, you want to leave? Yes, Scarlett, Scarlett, Scarlett, Scarlett's in that one. I am. Chris Kristofferson is representing the sexy old rockers. Ooh, busy Phillips.\n\nVeu C00:46:11\n\nI'm going to say, Jennifer Aniston, just because she's so popular that she was the first one you thought of to mention that one sticks out.\n\nVeu A00:46:21\n\nOh, wow. You'd think that there's no design to or I'm just.\n\nVeu C00:46:27\n\nI guess that's a pretty stupid strategy.\n\nVeu A00:46:28\n\nI'm just saying, I'm just randomly saying things.\n\nVeu C00:46:31\n\nYou're right. No, that's me putting it. That's too much trust. You're right. Yeah, it might be.\n\nVeu A00:46:37\n\nI don't know.\n\nVeu C00:46:38\n\nGullibility. OK.\n\nVeu A00:46:41\n\nAnd also, you can change your answer in a second if you want. Let's see. Let's talk to Frank for a second. Yeah. Who do you think it is, Frank?\n\nVeu D00:46:49\n\nOK, that's. I can't pick Jennifer Anderson. Yeah, you can't. Oh, I think Jennifer Anderson. Okay.\n\nVeu A00:47:02\n\nAdam, what do you think?\n\nVeu B00:47:05\n\nOh, God. Unfortunately, I think right now Bradley Cooper, just because of all of the prestige and these massive movies that he's in, that he's directing, starring and nominated for goddamn everything, I think it's Bradley Cooper. I think it's Bradley Cooper is the first one.\n\nVeu A00:47:26\n\nI think that. Yeah, what's this new thing he's going to do? He's writing and directing again.\n\nVeu D00:47:31\n\nHe's remaking something else. It's the Muhammad Ali story. Oh, right. No, I'm just making. I'm just fucking.\n\nVeu B00:47:40\n\nNo, he is doing some kind of either right or what the hell is it?\n\nVeu A00:47:46\n\nYeah, I forgot what it was, but I am facing it. I mean, it sounds like it's going to be cool. Yeah. All right. I think it's friendly. Whatever it is. Yeah. OK, so you're going badly. So, Rina, now do you want to adjust your answer?\n\nVeu C00:48:01\n\nYeah. I think Bradley Hooper is a great guest. And I feel like Ben Affleck also has, like, even though it's not creative accomplishments, him getting back with J.Lo really boosts him up there. Oh, shit.\n\nVeu B00:48:15\n\nYeah, that's true.\n\nVeu C00:48:16\n\nBut I think I actually want to change my answer to Drew Barrymore because she's really on fire right now with her talk show and all that stuff.\n\nVeu A00:48:23\n\nOkay, you're going Drew B. Yeah. All right, Frank, you want to switch your answer to you want to share with Pat? No, do you want to?\n\nVeu D00:48:31\n\nYeah, I would go Bradley Cooper because if you go Marvel movies and everything's got yet.\n\nVeu A00:48:36\n\nYeah.\n\nVeu D00:48:37\n\nYeah.\n\nVeu A00:48:37\n\nAll right, you're going Bradley. Yeah. Well, here's how it breaks down. It's a shocking, shocking turn of events because all the way in the sixth position is Drew Barrymore. Wow. What?\n\nVeu C00:48:53\n\nI see her everywhere. Okay.\n\nVeu A00:48:54\n\nYeah, I thought she knew it. Wow. People, I guess, they're seeing her. They don't need to look her name up on the.\n\nVeu B00:49:01\n\nOh, yeah, that's true. Yeah, we're ubiquitous. You're going to go. That's right. Okay.\n\nVeu A00:49:05\n\nYeah. Number five. Number five is Ben Affleck.\n\nVeu C00:49:10\n\nWow, I'm in the, oh, I'm not even a for loser on this one.\n\nVeu A00:49:14\n\nWell, listen, I mean, number four is really a shocker too, because that's where Jennifer Aniston ended up, is number four.\n\nVeu B00:49:23\n\nI thought, honestly, I thought it would be Bradley, Ben, and then Jennifer, and then Scarlet. Wow, that really threw me.\n\nVeu A00:49:31\n\nYeah. Scargio came in third. Okay. Nobody said her. That would have been worth one point. But Bradley Coops is at number two. So Frank and I each get two points. Wow. Who's number one? Number one is Jennifer Connolly.\n\nVeu G00:49:49\n\nWhat?\n\nVeu A00:49:50\n\nBecause he's currently starring in everybody's favorite movie, Top Gun Maverick.\n\nVeu B00:49:57\n\nOh, that's right. God damn it. That's right. She plays the the crusty bar owner or something.\n\nVeu D00:50:04\n\nOh, let's win again.\n\nVeu C00:50:05\n\nIs she a Scientologist? Or is it just Tom Cruise? She's not right.\n\nVeu B00:50:11\n\nWell, I know she got some of that Scientology energy off of him.\n\nVeu C00:50:15\n\nYeah.\n\nVeu B00:50:16\n\nGoddamn. Oh, that's brutal.\n\nVeu A00:50:19\n\nYeah. Now you understand, again, a better idea of what we're talking about with this algorithm.\n\nVeu B00:50:26\n\nOh, yeah. OK, really? Oh, what's going on? OK, OK.\n\nVeu A00:50:31\n\nLet's go round two, Frank. Frank, you get away in first. On a motion picture called The Village, directed by the Master Night Shyamalan. I'm not telling a Master, an Amstance for Master, and I don't know what his Amstance for. I hope it's Mary Richards.\n\nVeu B00:50:57\n\nOh boy, there could be a lot of, oh wow, okay. I'm already thinking of some of the cast right now.\n\nVeu A00:51:04\n\nYeah, we got Adrian Brody, we got Joaquin Phoenix, M9, of course, cameos up, cameos it up, Judy.\n\nVeu B00:51:14\n\nWell, we know he's the number one spy. Let's see who gets number, let's pick number two. We know he'll be number one.\n\nVeu A00:51:20\n\nSix, Bryce Dallas, the Gorny Weaver was in that one.\n\nVeu D00:51:23\n\nBryce Dallas Howard, Brendan Gleeson. I'm going to go Bryce Dallas Howard for first. Okay.\n\nVeu B00:51:31\n\nWow. Yeah. Yeah. Oh shit. Wait a minute. Wait a minute. Wait a minute. But then they just announced that Joker sequel with Lady Gaga. So that might end. And Joaquin Phoenix. Fuck. Joaquin. Yeah, that might edge. I'm going to pick Joaquin for number one. I'm going Bryce.\n\nVeu A00:51:49\n\nWilliam hurt. Just died. Yeah, Jesse Eisenberg. What do you think, Reena?\n\nVeu C00:51:57\n\nI'm gonna, I'm gonna go with Sigourney Weaver.\n\nVeu B00:52:03\n\nReally? Yeah.\n\nVeu C00:52:04\n\nYou're gonna dream leave it? Yeah, yeah, I really, yeah. Yeah, I guess I haven't seen a movie in a long time, but I really like it.\n\nVeu E00:52:15\n\nFrank, what are you sticking with yours?\n\nVeu B00:52:18\n\nYeah. Bryce Ella's Howard. I love him.\n\nVeu A00:52:21\n\nBryce Ella's Howard all the way.\n\nVeu B00:52:22\n\nThat's a smart guess, too. That's a smart guess, man.\n\nVeu A00:52:26\n\nAll right, Pat. And you're going with walking.\n\nVeu B00:52:29\n\nYeah.\n\nVeu A00:52:31\n\nAll right. Well, I'm sorry to say that you're not walking on sunshine. Because he did manage to come in the top three, but he is in the third slot. Oh, man. See, I had a sixth sense that he'd be number one. Right. That's weird. You know, it's the thing is he's not unbreakable.\n\nVeu B00:52:56\n\nYeah, you know what? Right now, maybe right now he's just not happening. You know, that's what could be going on.\n\nVeu D00:53:02\n\nIt's a real decision.\n\nVeu C00:53:05\n\nYou got to look for signs, you know?\n\nVeu E00:53:08\n\nYeah, you don't want to treat this like a glass half empty situation.\n\nVeu D00:53:14\n\nYeah, you want to treat it like a lady in the water.\n\nVeu E00:53:19\n\nI love always getting old.\n\nVeu B00:53:24\n\nI love how the last ones are always just jammed in the square. How do we get this joke in here?\n\nVeu A00:53:31\n\nAlso, though, did we miss any or we get every chemo on? What was that one?\n\nVeu B00:53:36\n\nLike I saw the devil or the death thing in the elevator with the Right.\n\nVeu C00:53:41\n\nI mean, I think you really have to have a sixth sense for these things, you know? Yeah, I didn't hear that. I didn't even hear it.\n\nVeu F00:53:48\n\nOh, the love of God.\n\nVeu C00:53:49\n\nI said that. That's why I started it.\n\nVeu F00:53:51\n\nOh, God.\n\nVeu B00:53:56\n\nWell, what are you? What are you an airbender?\n\nVeu A00:53:59\n\nWell, all right. Well, some bad news for you, Arena, because Sigourney Weaver, she came in at number six out of the cast of that movie. And just for the sake of time, I'll jump to number two is Adrian Brody. Well, I think he just signed on to some some big thing or has something coming out like a series or something. And then Uh, oh, maybe he's in the next, did they announce the next Wes Anderson?\n\nVeu B00:54:29\n\nOh, maybe.\n\nVeu A00:54:31\n\nYeah. Cause he's a real Wes Anderson guy now. Um, coming at number one is Dallas Bryce. Frank, there you go, buddy. They come out. You did it. But we got one round left and Pat gets to go first in this last one. Oh God, here we go. It's never too early in the year to start talking about how much I don't like the movie. Love actually. Yeah. Holy shit. What a cast. Bill Nye calling first Liam Neeson, Kira Knight, Hugh Grant, Laura Lenny, Alan Rickman, Emma Thompson. And that guy, Thomas Brody, Sankster, the little kid in that movie is now a guy who always looks like he's still only 15 years old. He's in Queens, Gambit, and now he plays Malcolm McLaren. And that's right.\n\nVeu A00:55:31\n\nThomas Brody Sangster.\n\nVeu C00:56:22\n\nI mean, you know, I'm really playing a strong game here, and I think I'm going to go with another older reference that I hope is still popular enough to get the top spot with Hugh Grant. Um, I feel like one hooker mishap really keeps you on people's minds for a long time. I don't know.\n\nVeu A00:56:40\n\nI'll tell you what keeps him on my mind. He's terrific in, uh, adding to him too. Oh, yeah.\n\nVeu B00:56:48\n\nWell, that'll do that. Oh my gosh. Yeah. He's great in that.\n\nVeu C00:56:53\n\nYeah. Yeah. I feel good about that one. That's my answer. Okay.\n\nVeu A00:56:57\n\nUm, Because it's been a second since I saw Unbearable Way to Master Talent, but they say that Paddington 2 is the movie they're watching in the movie, right? Or is it Paddington 1? That was Paddington 2. I think it's 2, yeah. Because it really 2 really is better than 1.\n\nVeu B00:57:15\n\nOh God, yeah.\n\nVeu A00:57:17\n\nYeah. And especially because, you know, it's the rare sequel that didn't say, oh, we need to have 2 Paddington's. You know, like they kept it to the 1 Bear. They remain with the bare minimum.\n\nVeu B00:57:30\n\nOh, my God, and heaven.\n\nVeu A00:57:37\n\nAll right. Who happened? What just happened? Oh, you were a huge grant.\n\nVeu D00:57:43\n\nOK, this is tough. I want to say Liam Neeson because he. He's just been around, but also Hugh Grant had that show that came out, like on HBO. So he's been crazy.\n\nVeu A00:57:54\n\nOh, he's in gas. He's in gas lit.\n\nVeu D00:57:56\n\nYeah, he's a gas lit. Yeah. But also to a tell, nobody good in gas lit though.\n\nVeu B00:58:02\n\nYeah. Yeah, that gas is just bottom scrapers, man.\n\nVeu A00:58:06\n\nYeah, real rough and rough road. Have you seen it? Have you seen gas lit, Frank? Yeah.\n\nVeu D00:58:12\n\nYeah, yeah, yeah.\n\nVeu A00:58:13\n\nPatons in it.\n\nVeu D00:58:15\n\nWait, they might know.\n\nVeu B00:58:19\n\nFrank, that hurts, man.\n\nVeu D00:58:20\n\nThat's the movie where the guy or the series or the guy kills his wife, right? Oh, no, you're thinking of the stare face. No, no, no.\n\nVeu A00:58:29\n\nYou pray I was in that one. That was a mystery.\n\nVeu B00:58:36\n\nOh, what the hell? He had a really weird boss.\n\nVeu A00:58:39\n\nHe had a kid who had something weird happened to him.\n\nVeu B00:58:42\n\nYeah.\n\nVeu A00:58:43\n\nYeah. Yeah. Yeah. Whatever that was called.\n\nVeu B00:58:47\n\nTrust me, he was not in gas. I would have remembered that.\n\nVeu A00:58:51\n\nYeah. I don't know why I thought he was. Who's like second build after Julia and that? Ed Harris? Sean Penn. Sean Penn. That's what it is. Is it Sean Penn, but he's made up funny?\n\nVeu B00:59:04\n\nYeah.\n\nVeu A00:59:05\n\nYeah. So that's why I just decided it was a different actor.\n\nVeu B00:59:08\n\nYeah, he looks like Fred Mertz, basically.\n\nVeu A00:59:10\n\nThat's how his Hugh Grant ended up in makeup. Um, because he looks so good and all those, all those makeups he did in Cloud Atlas. Okay. Uh, who don't eat before?\n\nVeu D00:59:21\n\nWow. You would tell? Yeah. Because of Dr. Strange.\n\nVeu A00:59:26\n\nWell, this is really, this is really exciting. This is an exciting finish. I got to tell you because, um, Patton gets a point because, uh, Laurel and he did get the third spot. Oh, but both Frank and Rena, both of theirs didn't make, uh, From what I'm seeing here, they even make the top eight. But she would tell number eight. Oh, wow. What?\n\nVeu C00:59:54\n\nAnd he beat Hugh?\n\nVeu A00:59:56\n\nAnd Hugh Grant, I don't know where the hell he is. I didn't even write. He's so deep in the lineup. I didn't even write. Hugh Grant? Whoa! Yeah, I don't know what that's about. But I can tell you what almost happened. Frank almost said Liam Mason, who did come in in the second spot. Damn, it came to number one. Number one. And I think I know why. Number one for love, actually, is Emma Thompson. Oh.\n\nVeu B01:00:22\n\nOh, yeah.\n\nVeu A01:00:23\n\nShe's placed Miss Trunchball on this latest movie version. Oh, yeah. And on stage, the musical, the version they're doing for this movie, on stage, it's just been traditionally a big, weird looking man, playing the part, sort of dressed as, you know, and he's wearing like a dress and he's mistrunchable, but he hasn't really asked that feminine, obviously. And it gives him a cast, Emma Thompson in the movie, and she looks amazing in it, but there's all this talk of like, why does the character have to be fat? And I mean, why are you fetching me? And it's just like, well, now, so now the characters are villain.\n\nVeu C01:01:06\n\nAnd it's like you're saying that people are villainous. She's described as like a big brutish like present. Like it's not a fat thing. It's a volume thing. Like she has to be massive. And it's cartoonish too.\n\nVeu A01:01:20\n\nBut yes, she's more boxy than fat. She's like, yeah, she's big. The point is she's intimidating for the children. It's what children envision a big teacher to be this giant menacing You know, well, she like slingshots children.\n\nVeu C01:01:33\n\nLike also, I don't know. It's like, it's like Andre the Giant. Yeah.\n\nVeu B01:01:38\n\nMaybe they can do like, they can add a backstory where she does hot dog eating competitions to raise money for Planned Parenthood, and that'll balance it out.\n\nVeu A01:01:46\n\nLike that's why I wish they could do that, Pat, with the movies completed.\n\nVeu B01:01:51\n\nOh, man, you know, they can do amazing things. Yeah, just put big in there.\n\nVeu A01:01:59\n\nWhat you do is you get Christopher Plummer and Tig. One of them sits on the other one's shoulders and they play his trench bolt.\n\nVeu C01:02:10\n\nYeah, like let's do a deep dive, like instead of Joker, trunch bolt and just find out what her like glandular disorder was. And you know, just her normal health problems that go into her glandular background. Yeah, you know.\n\nVeu A01:02:25\n\nSo it was a real close race today. Reena, you know, it was almost uncanny your instincts for not picking anybody that would be half free. I'm more fringe, but nobody could argue about your choices were all solid. And then, of course, Patton really almost got there at the end with, you know, man, should get one more point. But at four points, Patton is one behind Frank winner with five.\n\nVeu C01:02:56\n\nWow. Congrats. Congratulations, Frank.\n\nVeu B01:02:59\n\nWhere you go, buddy?\n\nVeu C01:03:00\n\nI bow to you both. That was quite a round.\n\nVeu A01:03:04\n\nThe team will be in touch soon with you, Frank, about coming back. But in the meantime, you get to do your plugs first. Go ahead and promote yourself.\n\nVeu D01:03:13\n\nOh, hey, yeah, you can find me on a Frankenstein on Instagram. And then I'm going to be in North and South Carolina opening up for Polly Shore to lie seventh through the 17th. Wow. Nice. That's going to be fun. I'm going to end up in someone's basement in the woods. We're like, we have. Yeah. Thank God.\n\nVeu A01:03:36\n\nYeah. Bring a flare gun and some sort of booster for your internet on your phone. Yeah. And also don't go.\n\nVeu B01:03:44\n\nYeah. That'll be the main thing. Don't go.\n\nVeu A01:03:46\n\nThat's how you keep yourself safe.\n\nVeu C01:03:54\n\nI would definitely like to promote my first comedy album that's being released as we speak. If you're listening to this on July 1st, which is when it comes out midnight in the morning, you know what I mean. So comedy is my album. It's on helium comedy records. And I'm really excited to release it into the world. And the best place to find me would be probably Instagram. And I got one of those link trees in my bio to all my videos. I have a book of puns on Amazon. All the stuff's on there. So Rina Calm on Instagram is the best way to stay in touch with me. And I'm always somewhere. I've been traveling nonstop for a few years. So you can find me. Probably in a nearby parking lot brushing my teeth.\n\nVeu A01:04:38\n\nShe's out. Well, you know, I've been spending a lot of time out of the orchard because I just love plucking links from the link trees. It's just it call is a calming activity. It really makes me feel.\n\nVeu C01:04:55\n\nI had to make a link tree as I found out somebody made a wiki feet for me. Sorry to bury the lead there. Yeah. It's just pictures of me doing stand up in sandals. It's not that exciting. Telling people that my wiki feet is on my link tree has really directed a lot of traffic to it. So please help me boost my score on wiki feet. I'd like to get above a three.\n\nVeu B01:05:16\n\nHey, if it sells tickets, it sells tickets, man. That's what this is about. OK, but some seats.\n\nVeu A01:05:23\n\nYou can see. Can't you just get some professional shots of your feet and throw them on there?\n\nVeu C01:05:29\n\nYeah, but I like the authenticity of it. You know what I mean? I want, I'm here for an honest. Yeah, if they're fine.\n\nVeu A01:05:36\n\nThe person who took the picture of you in the sandals, like that was just someone who just turned around and submitted it to wiki feet.\n\nVeu C01:05:42\n\nNo, it's way worse. It's just pictures that are like of me doing stand up and I happen to have been wearing sandals that day and like somebody went through and compiled all the pictures like that. And put them. Wow. Yeah. Like a good lord. Yeah. Yeah. I mean, yeah, it's, you know, sandals more as mine.\n\nVeu A01:06:02\n\nI'm thinking.\n\nVeu C01:06:05\n\nHey, it's getting the clicks. I'll, you know, I'll get some more pedicures, you know, but in seats.\n\nVeu A01:06:11\n\nYeah. All the matters. Patton, you had on like futuristic looking sandals at the last show I saw you.\n\nVeu B01:06:17\n\nYes. Well, I Because I forgot I had been walking around in my futuristic sandals all day, and I just left the house and just forgot that I had them on. And I get to the show, I'm like, I'm wearing fucking sandals. Oh my God. So humiliating.\n\nVeu A01:06:33\n\nBut they look like little space shoes. They're like, why? They did. Yeah. Clearly, it never left the house. They're very good. Oh, yeah.\n\nVeu C01:06:42\n\nWiki feed is actually how I found out I am on IMDB. It's for a thing you've never heard of. But there's a good chance if you've worn sandals in public that you've made it onto Wiki feed. I don't know who's running it, but they're pretty thorough. There you go.\n\nVeu A01:06:55\n\nI've never worn a sandal in public, so I gotta get on that. Or is it all women or do they have dudes feet too?\n\nVeu C01:07:03\n\nI can't say that I looked around much.\n\nVeu A01:07:05\n\nI would love it if that was not a two-way street. I would love it if all women just had no interest in men's feet.\n\nVeu C01:07:13\n\nYeah, I don't know anybody that does, but yeah, I don't think inclusive, you know, somebody.\n\nVeu A01:07:19\n\nYou don't know anybody it does because the first rule of feet clubs and not talk about feet club.\n\nVeu C01:07:25\n\nOh, yeah, yeah, yeah. Yeah. Oops.\n\nVeu A01:07:27\n\nMy bad. Padna's Wall, where are you going this weekend? Oh, this weekend. Yeah, that land issue.\n\nVeu B01:07:35\n\nYeah, I got the whole land issue. And then, you know what, since I'm going to be out there, I'll do comedy in New Jersey, and then at the Paramount Theatre in Huntington, at the end of the month, you can catch me hosting the JFL Gala Friday, July 29th, that I'm doing Massey Hall and Toronto on the 30th, the following week. Friday, July 5th, my movie, I Love My Dad, premieres in theaters. On the same day, the Sandman premieres on Netflix, which I am in. And then Wednesday, August 24th, my new comic book, Minor Threats from Dark Horse, comes out.\n\nVeu A01:08:08\n\nI mean, no excuse on that one day. You know, they say I didn't want to leave the house. OK. You know, either go out and see them or stay home and see them. I've seen, I love my dad. I love my dad.\n\nVeu B01:08:26\n\nI love my other choice. You saw it at South by Southwest.\n\nVeu A01:08:28\n\nYeah, but I always fuck up the title because I want to say I love you, dad, but I love my dad.\n\nVeu B01:08:33\n\nI love my dad.\n\nVeu A01:08:34\n\nAnd it's, and it's, I can't recommend it highly enough. I mean, I know. Rena said that everything everywhere else wants to do one of the best movies he's ever seen. Well, get ready for, I love my dad. I'm over selling it because it's a little movie, but it's a little movie that is probably you've probably never been as creeped out, slashed, entertained. You know, usually when things are creepy and uncomfortable, you want to look away. But for some reason, it's a fun version of that.\n\nVeu B01:09:07\n\nYeah, the guy, director James Marcine did an amazing job, just amazing job.\n\nVeu A01:09:13\n\nIt's worth, I don't mind going along today to talk to, because I'm sorry we didn't talk about that earlier, because that's okay. That's one people really should turn out for. What a delightful way to spend a hot summer afternoon is get in the air conditioning, get, take out a loan, and put Put your house into reverse mortgage so you can get popcorn in the soda. That's right. And enjoy Patton making his son extremely uncomfortable.\n\nVeu B01:09:45\n\nYes. Yes. For 90 minutes for 90 minutes. 90 minutes of squirm. Really fun.\n\nVeu A01:09:50\n\nIt's none of this hour, 55, four, but this is a nine year out. Yeah. Cut and dried.\n\nVeu B01:09:58\n\nThat's right. Well, you see, when you see how much time you have left in the day, you know what you'll say? You'll say yay. Yeah. I brought it back. I brought it back.\n\nVeu A01:10:07\n\nYeah. You'll say, I love his daddy, too. Doug plugs, Douglas movies is back at Dynasty typewriter here in LA on Sunday, July 17 at 420.

Thank you for having me.\n\nVeu A01:11:03\n\nAt the end of every episode, I say, last line from a motion picture might not be a famous last line, might not be a famous motion picture. But here's a weird one. As always, brick wall, brick wall, brick wall, a brick wall.\n\nVeu H01:11:24\n\nNow it's time for duck to watch another talkie.
