        "text": "Zimzala food truck is bringing the beach vibes!\n\nLast weekend I caught up with Misty Thrower at her newest endeavor, the Zimzala food truck. For those not familiar with Misty (I wasnt) she was the previous owner of the popular downtown spot formerly known as Bel Air Bar and Grill. ...\n\nGoose & Gander: Reeling in the catch of the day\n\nSome people believe in luck while others describe moments when stars seem to align as serendipitous. The past couple of weeks I have been called to partake in what has been described as an oddity to some but an epicurean event to others: The Tinned Fish Summer. ...\n\nKelso Kwik Stop: What in the baklava is going on?\n\nHow are you? I overheard one persons question followed by another persons quick response. Im still here. It was noon-ish on a Wednesday, and I was sitting alone at a nondescript table for four just a few feet from the cash register. Based on demographics I found for the village of Kelso online, I should have stuck out like a fajita on a veggie tray, but if anyone noticed they didnt say a peep. ...\n\nGetting to the heart of Coras Taste of Manila\n\nI was drawn to 2502 Tanner Drive in Cape Girardeau by the possibility of dynamite. I wanted to feel the heat. While it is an honor to walk alongside those learning how to traverse the damage, destruction and pain evil leaves in its wake, it can take its toll on ones psyche. Escaping through culinary exploration offers a convenient and accessible opportunity to cleanse my palate, literally and spiritually. ...\n\nCharlies Smokehouse to create a cult following\n\nA friend recently mentioned Charlie's Smokehouse, located at 5156 State Hwy. 34 in Burfordville, and piqued my curiosity. The next beautiful (yet scorching) Saturday afternoon I set my car stereo to radio mode and let the DJ at Mike FM choose my tunes. I quickly lost myself in car karaoke bliss, but halfway through Jackson, I began to have second thoughts. Exactly how far was this place? Was it in the \"drop zone\" where I lose cell service? I love my Toyota, but ever since the odometer hit 300k miles, the ability to summon roadside assistance has played a more significant role in choosing my destinations. ....\n\nBrisket is an out-of-this-world experience\n\nIf you've been following this column for a while, it should come as no surprise I enjoy a good underdog story. Predictable has a place, but there's just something about being counted out that makes the comeback taste so much sweeter, or as in the case of brisket, that much more savory. Historically, brisket was not a prime cut of meat and was thus more economical and accessible to poorer families. It required hours of marinating and smoking at low temperatures to break through the tough, fatty text to salvage something palatable.\n\nCity Tavern: Belly up to the bar after Sunday service\n\nJust when I thought Id run out of new restaurants to try, a friend with good judgment suggested I might want to take a quick road trip over to City Tavern in downtown Perryville for some good old homestyle cooking. I was intrigued by the suggestion, and immediately squeezed the visit onto my Sunday \"to do\" list, right between church and grocery shopping. ...\n\nFudio: The artist in me celebrates the artist in you\n\nFusion. As a person who champions the importance of diversity in every aspect of life, it should come as no surprise my tastebuds relished the culinary fusion of flavors experienced on a recent visit to Fudio, Chef Lisa Essmyers kitchen studio. ...\n\nA visit to Sonny Side Cafe chased my Monday blues away\n\nI am 100% the bird chirping, sun shining on a cloudy day kind of morning person, and I fully embrace it. Anyone who has a problem with my morning cheer can take it up with the big guy upstairs  I was born this way, which my mom readily confirms. She had no cranky babies...\n\nSandy's Place will fix your face\n\nThey say when you're happy you enjoy the music, but when you're sad you understand the lyrics. I first heard Sinead O'Conner's haunting rendition of \"Nothing Compares 2U\" in the 90's. Her voice, full of depth and emotion, powerfully conveyed what many people of my generation will recall as their first season of love and heartbreak...\n\nEl Kolibri: Exploring the flavors of life with an empanada\n\n\"People will forget what you said, people will forget what you did, but people will never forget how you made them feel.\" Those words by author and poet Maya Angelou sum up my impromptu visit to El Kolibri Coffee shop on the first springlike Saturday of the year...\n\nSedona: Getting to the heart of things with Reuben\n\nLast time we met, I was at Fuel Bar + Taco in Jackson, sleuthing out what anonymous locals like to eat while trying to delve a little deeper than the dish. After indulging in the Fuel hot dog, my new friend sent me to ... Sedona Bistro located at 1812 Carondalet St. in Cape Girardeau to experience her favorite dish -- the Reuben...\n\nFuel-ing my foodie smack down\n\nLast week I stopped into Fuel Bar + Taco, located at 634 W. Main St. in Jackson, for a quick lunch, and a bright idea popped into my head. Tag team wrestling. I haven't followed wrestling since childhood, but I recall I was a huge fan of the excitement. ...\n\nAn Italian, a Latina and a mechanic walk into a building ...\n\nI wish I had a good punchline to go along with the headline, but this is simply the true story of how my recent visit to Mario and Angela's Italian Eatery in Jackson unfolded. If you're local, you've probably been nostalgically awaiting the return of Mario's pizza. If you're new to the area, hold on to your hat because you are in for one heck of a treat...\n\nGreen's Garden Italian beef sandwich is OK-ish, and so are you!\n\nIt's the most wonderful time of the year! Gifts of twinkling lights, sweet treats and cheerful music burst from every nook and cranny as expectations for the holiday season steadily rise. A couple weeks ago, I began Saturday with a clear agenda. By 9 a.m., I was quickly checking boxes off of my \"to-do\" list. The air was fresh and crisp, the sun glorious and beckoning. God was clearly smiling down on me, and no one could have convinced me otherwise...\n\nLaw & Order SPU: Hot honey, jalapenos, and pesto\n\nIn the world of pizza, there is a code. Individuals who investigate that code are members of an elite squad known as the SPU, Special Pizza Unit. This is one of their stories. It started on a crisp fall day. I sat in front of my computer contemplating a visit to Encore Pizzeria + Kitchen, which is inconspicuously tucked into a corner of the City Centre building at 2502 Tanner Drive in Cape Girardeau...\n\nMark your calendars for Menudo Day at Muy Bueno\n\nOur lives are marked by days, weeks, months and years. Sometimes we look back to December and other times we wake up when September ends. There are days designated to observe or celebrate certain events, while others are reminders to spread \"awareness\" of things some are trying their hardest to forget...\n\nPasta + Sauce & solo dining in CGC\n\nI have a friend who hails from New York. If his social media content is any indication, he is suffering from a serious case of homesickness. All of his friends and followers have recently been deluged by two things: photos of stylish people wearing cozy clothing while enjoying carefree strolls through the bright lights of the big city or serene sidewalk scenes of brownstones and tree-lined streets generously garnished with bright fall foliage...\n\nA calculated risk leads to the endzone: EC Reed's Mercantile & Hotel\n\nOctober has arrived, bringing with it some things I love most about football season: opportunities to root for underdogs such as Deion Sanders and his Colorado Buffaloes, mixed with the occasional sweet sideline love story, like the flourishing romance between pop star Taylor Swift and Kansas City Chief's tight end Travis Kelce. Before I delve too far into talk about who is huddling and who is cuddling, on to the real reason you've read this far  food...\n\nMove over, Momma  Bon Bon's calls dibs on Wednesday\n\nThe \"perfect storms\" in life serve as great reminders to savor moments when the \"stars\" seem to effortlessly align in our favor. That's my melodramatic take on how things fell apart then quickly fell back in place for me last week, with the help of Bon Bon's Restaurant and Artisan Bakery...\n\nGrace Coffee + Cafe: Keep being you\n\nIf you've driven past 1865 Broadway in Cape Girardeau, you may have noticed a bright cheerful business with the phrase \"Different is Good\" emblazoned in large letters across the length of the building. Just in case you have any doubts about their commitment to welcoming and celebrating everyone, the phrase is repeated on an interior wall for emphasis...\n\nWhat's on the menu: Limited time finds\n\nMaybe it is a side-effect of the extreme heat, but I recently found myself sliding into a cranky Scrooge-like mood as the fall school year quickly approached. No longer having school-aged children or a connection to the university, I was filled with trepidation thinking about the possible inconveniences ahead: bare grocery store shelves, waiting for a table at packed restaurants, limited parking everywhere and tacking an extra 20 to 30 minutes to my daily commute in an effort to avoid delays caused by the influx of traffic.. ...\n\nCatching the big one and other fun at the Downtown Farmers Market\n\nIt's that time of year again  back to school! With all the big and little changes on the horizon, it can be easy to jump back into \"Go! Go! Go!\" mode leaving the relaxation of summer far behind. Before you switch back into full steam ahead gear, I want to take a moment to gently remind you we only have a couple of months left to enjoy the Cape Riverfront Market before the season ends in October. ...\n\nJStreet Eats serves up food, fun and a side of nostalgia\n\nMarketing is that wonderful thing where complete strangers subtly try to convince us to buy things or buy into ideas. As a writer, storyteller and student of everything psychology, I appreciate a good marketing strategy. The sheer number of people who admit they watch the Super Bowl each year \"just for the commercials\" proves I am not alone in this regard...\n\nTry a Fatty Patty with your daddy\n\nLast week I had the opportunity to sit down and chat with Cody Snider, manager and co-owner of the new Fatty Patty Burger Barn restaurant, located in the old Zaxby's building in Cape Girardeau (407 Cape West Crossings). Talk about perfect timing. With Father's Day just around the corner, Fatty Patty's is serving up exactly what any burger-loving dad wants: burgers. ...\n\nUbe Ub-session\n\nIn case you didn't know, May was Asian American and Pacific Islander Heritage Month. I know school is out for the summer, but I couldn't resist the opportunity to Google educate myself on the many ways their contributions have help create what we consider to be the very fabric of \"America.\"...\n\nFeeling the heat and facing my fears to catch some Waves\n\nWe are still a month away from the official first day of summer, but the heat is already on, and it is only getting hotter! Everyone seems to be celebrating beginnings and endings of one type or another. Last week my social media pages were full of photos commemorating college graduations and Mother's Day. The trend will likely continue for the next couple of weeks with a burst of photos honoring high school grads, followed by photos of Father's Day festivities...\n\nBeacon 53  By the river and on the rocks\n\nJust last weekend, Muddy River Marathon drew participants to Cape Girardeau from as far away as Massachusetts, New York, South Carolina and Georgia. The evening before runners gathered at the starting line, I arrived at Century Casino for packet pickup. ...\n\nBerry season and salad season  a great combination\n\nThe sun is shining, temperatures are rising, and berry season has officially arrived, which means seasonal salads are showing up on menus everywhere. I spent the week exploring what Southeast Missouri has to offer and, so far, the options are deliciously distinct. Here are a few of my current recommendations:...\n\nIf you are what you eat, just call me fresh and healthy!\n\nOn Thursday, Feb. 22, I began a spiritual journey. I'll spare you the boring details. Well, I'll spare you some of the boring details. One element of my plan involved a commitment to fasting for a period of time. Writing a food column while fasting seemed like quite the endeavor, but I reminded myself I've overcome worse. ...\n\nConquering the Main Street Burger at Kelso Corner Grill\n\nA couple of weeks ago a little \"birdie\" clued me in and inspired me to take a quick trip south on the interstate to visit the Kelso Corner Grill, located at 151 S. Messmer St. in Kelso, Missouri. For those who have been around a while, the restaurant is located in the building that formerly housed the beloved \"Ray's of Kelso\" restaurant. ...\n\nFish fry season: Welcoming all the sinners and saints!\n\nIf you were hoping to read about my encounter with a massive beast of a burger, hang tight because all the details are coming soon to a newspaper near you. This week is all about a Lenten season tradition: The church \"basement\" fish fry. Now, before any of you get in a tizzy and accuse me of shoving religion down your throat, ask yourself a couple of questions: 1. ...\n\nRevival at Ikhatta: Not your average Valentine's Day love story\n\n\"Revival: an instance of returning to life or consciousness; restoration of vigour or vitality.\" Like many people, I choose a word to focus on and inspire me throughout the year. For me, it is a part of my spiritual practice and growth. Some people memorize complete Bible verses, I choose one word, have it printed on a bracelet, and wear it as a daily reminder. ...\n\nGongura: Experiencing the fresh flavors of India\n\nThis week I explored the taste of India at one of my favorite local restaurants: The Spanish Street Farmacy. I stopped by and spoke to the brains behind the \"virtual\" operation, Frank Green. Green explained he became interested in the Gongora (Hibiscus sabdariffa) plant while breaking bread with friends from India. ...\n\nThe Library: Best sellers, classics and new releases\n\nWhether a born-and- raised local, a regular, or someone just passing through Cape Girardeau, most people recognize The Library as a hub of the downtown nightlife. The Library, located at 10 S. Spanish St., offers a variety of entertainment options including happy hour, live music, karaoke, dancing, special events, televised sports, darts, patio games in their outdoor \"Playground\" area and a menu comprised of bar food favorites, salads, as well as heartier fare...\n\nD Duncan Floristry & Boutique  a great stop for your gourmet snacking needs\n\nIn case you haven't noticed, baby, it's cold outside. Winter is a great excuse to stay cozy indoors. Being averse to temperatures below 60 degrees, I don't need to be told twice. Unfortunately, a book at Barnes & Noble was calling my name, and I figured if I was going outside, I would make the trip worth my while...\n\nMary Ann's favorite things: A snack homage\n\nIt has been brought to my attention that an entire generation of young adults exist who either don't know Oprah Winfrey or do not fully grasp what she has accomplished in her career. This was brought to my attention via a tweet or a meme, which almost seems disrespectful...\n\nMy chance encounter with the mafia\n\nI relish stories involving serendipitous moments, especially when the story is mine. I wasn't supposed to be downtown that Saturday morning. I should have been at the gym hours earlier. Instead, it was 9 a.m., and I was still trying to coax myself out of bed. Unfortunately, my usual self-talk tactics were not working, and I was on the brink of sabotaging my progress by officially declaring it a \"me\" day and scrapping my workout...\n\nMexico on Wheels delivers a taste of Mexico City\n\nDo you crave Mexican food? Are you a sucker for a quick, open and airy street food experience? Do you like the adventure of tracking down food trucks? If you answered \"yes\" to any of those questions, you should plan on making the Mexico On Wheels food truck your next stop...\n\nThe Cheesecake Ninja strikes again\n\nI was on a mission a couple of weeks ago. It all started when, after months of preparation and training, I faced an unexpected obstacle. I had no control over the situation and wasn't sure getting back on track was possible. I prayed while holding tightly to doubt and fear. Then, I got an idea. If I was going to achieve my goal, I needed to get my mind right. I needed unshakeable focus and discipline. I needed to become like the ninjas of lore...\n\nThe Kozy: Discovering the big taste of a small town\n\nThere are many new dining options coming to our area. Unfortunately, most are weeks to months away from their opening dates. Luckily, while considering interesting restaurants to explore and share with you, I ran into an old friend. She always has the scoop on delicious things in the area and has never steered me wrong. When she recommended a sweet, indulgent, strawberry breakfast item from \"The Kozy\" in Bloomsdale, Missouri, I trusted the drive would be worth it...\n\nLos Boys Hideaway: The hunt for lunch leads to bison burger\n\nLast week, I was on the lookout for a new-to-me restaurant for a lunch that wouldn't demolish my nutritional or financial goals for the day when I came across the menu for the Los Boys Hideaway in Egypt Mills. While several popular menu staples were listed under the appetizer, burger, sandwich and salad categories, the \"Buffalo (bison) burger\" is what caught my attention...\n\nRelationship status: Taken  you had me at 'Hello'\n\nRelationships can be beautiful things. They nourish our souls. They bring peace to our days. They can be a source of joy and laughter. The best ones require commitment, understanding and grace. A good relationship is a great investment with amazing rewards...\n\nFairy tales can come true when you buy a Turk Dawg ... or two\n\nOnce upon a time, there was a man named Jamie Turk. People near and far knew him simply as \"Turk.\" Turk and Suzana had four children: Kayleigh, Lizzy, Jeffrey and Justin. Turk loved baseball, so it was no surprise when his twin daughters became a force to be reckoned with on the softball field. ...\n\nCrepe Girardeau beats sleeping in on Saturday\n\nThere are all kinds of \"to do\" lists this time of year. There are lists of activities to do with your children over the summer and lists of things to do to get beach ready. There are lists of things to do before heading off to college, along with lists of ways to deal with a newly-empty nest. You can find an endless number of \"to do\" lists on a wide variety of topics ranging from travel, hiking and fishing to home renovation, lawn care and everything in between...\n\nGrecian Steakhouse: Great spot to get your gyro fix\n\nIt was bittersweet when Zoi's Gyros closed it's doors a couple of months ago. I was one of many who braved the long lines for a final bon voyage buy. Then, as it always does, life went on without much more thought about gyros. Until last week, that is, when my mind signaled I was in need of a gyro fix. ...\n\nFalling head over heels at The Beanik Café and Pastry\n\nNew love is a beautiful thing. The sun shines brighter. Birds sing louder. Flowers appear to be painted in Technicolor bold, and everyone you meet seems to exude warmth, love and joy. For a moment, everything feels right in the world. I know, I'm gushing. I can't help it. They say it always happens when you least expect it, and I can confirm that is true...\n\nShimmy over to downtown Cape's newest location for a java jolt\n\nAfter driving past 811 Broadway in downtown Cape Girardeau for months on end waiting for any signs of life, I was rewarded Saturday afternoon. Speakeasy Coffee Company finally opened. I wrapped up some business a few doors down then wandered over. I wish I could say I was dressed in my \"glad rags\" on my way to shimmy the hours away in a dimly lit lounge, but it isn't that kind of speakeasy...\n\nSouthern fried chicken and a side of humble pie, please\n\nLast Friday I had a plan. It was as loose plan, but a plan nonetheless. My indecisive self had narrowed my eating exploration down to two locations of considerable distance. However, when I woke on Saturday morning I just wasn't feeling my usual spontaneous, road-trip-eady self. I was not in the mood to drive 30 to 60 minutes for something I wasn't sure I would enjoy. I was looking for a sure thing, and I knew the perfect place...\n\nShady Oak Market: A hidden gem serves up a simple classic\n\nA friend's answer to my usual end of the week question, \"So, do you have any plans for the weekend?\" led me 47 miles away from home the very next day. She said she and her husband planned to take a little drive out to the Shady Oak Market in Bloomfield, Missouri, for lunch and some shopping. The way she raved about their sandwiches made this bread-loving woman salivate like Pavlov's dog...\n\nMy dramatic pilgrimage to Wat's Smokin' BBQ\n\nA spiritual journey recently led me to Egypt Mills. Egypt Mills is an unincorporated community located approximately 12 miles from Jackson, in east Cape Girardeau County. I previously visited the area to shop at a cute little boutique, but this time I was on a journey to Wat's Smokin' BBQ to make smoked salmon my first lenten lunch ever...\n\nCelebrating Food Truck Friday with 1UP Catering\n\nLast Friday I took a midday trip to the SEMO PETS parking lot located at 180 Weston St. in Cape Girardeau. Ordinarily, I would have been there to drop off a donation or to volunteer (aka play with all the sweet puppies and dogs waiting for their forever homes), but this time I was on a different mission. I was looking for the newest installment to the local food truck scene: 1UP Catering...\n\nA La Carte Catering brings a new dining experience to Jackson\n\nThis week I was prepared to give you the scoop on Mana Tea downtown. Imagine my surprise when I discovered Rebecca LaClair beat me to the punch with her column last week. You know what they say about great minds ... I enjoyed the creamy ube taro milk tea I picked up after shopping at the cute boutique next door, Belle Ever After. ...\n\nMy compliments to the chef\n\nLast week I made a bunch of bad decisions after seeing we had nasty weather headed our way. I don't enjoy being cold, but I can certainly appreciate the excuse it gives me to stay warm and cozy at home indulging in all kinds of comfort foods, so off to the store I went to load up on \"supplies.\"...\n\nMadi's Kitchen: Food inspired by love\n\nWhere do you put all the \"leftover\" love when you lose someone much too soon? That is the challenge Yameka Robinson and her family faced in August 2019 after a senseless act of gun violence left 20-year-old Ryan Robinson injured and ended the life of 15-year-old Madison \"Madi\" Robinson...\n\nMy last date with Pho 8\n\nOn Christmas Eve eve I grabbed a pen and notebook and headed over to Pho 8. I was looking for a steaming hot bowl of comfort food and hoping to find inspiration for this column along the way. I get a little anxious at the culmination of each year. While most people are worrying about their New Year's Eve attire or who they will be kissing when midnight arrives, I feel pressure to make everything THE BEST EVER before 2021 slips away into the past...\n\nSalerno's Pizzeria: I found a cheeseburger in paradise\n\nThroughout my career I've had some great mentors. One, a retired marine, exemplified integrity by treating everyone with care, dignity, and respect. He was one of many who set the bar high for the kind of person I wanted to become. I tell his story over and over. ...\n\nEven Santa wants Krabby Daddy's for Christmas\n\nThis is your brief glimpse into the (not so) glamorous life of a local foodie writer. Food is probably the last thing anyone wants to think about after the planning, preparation, expense and gluttonous feasting that is Thanksgiving. I am no different...\n\nKaty O'Ferrell's : A downtown destination\n\nWe are at the time of year when many are beginning to fantasize about their favorite holiday dish. Thanksgiving turkey. Stuffing. Pumpkin everything. Eggnog. Christmas decor is everywhere, and retail workers are already ending their shifts ready to fight anyone who so much as whistles one more Christmas tune. ...\n\nFry bread at Fuel: Honoring Native American Heritage Month through food\n\nThe only thing I enjoy more than good food is good food with a story. A powerful story. This week as I returned to the familiar grounds of Fuel Bar + Taco in Jackson (634 W. Main St.), I found myself on a culinary journey that led to an emotional and educational undertaking beyond my expectations...\n\nThe Baker's Bar: Hitting The Bar on my lunch hour\n\nOctober is here! Many people are excited because it is officially Halloween month. The leaves have started to change color, fall decor is invading our indoor spaces and some women have put away their white shoes, and stepped (albeit prematurely) into their winter boots as if their efforts will summon cooler temperatures. It doesn't appear to be working  temperatures remain plenty warm. Maybe wearing Sherpa pullovers next week will help? It's worth a try...\n\nFind the flavors of France on the corner of Spanish and Themis streets\n\nEight years ago, director David Fincher brought actor Ben Affleck and some Hollywood glam to the corner of Spanish and Themis Street when he selected \"The Bar\" as one location for the filming of his movie \"Gone Girl.\" I remember feeling the buzz of excitement in the air as the crowd of onlookers patiently waited for an opportunity to take a photo with Affleck. For a moment, we experienced a bit of Hollywood right here in Cape Girardeau...\n\nDB's Barbecue: Where there's smoke, there's fire\n\nThe past couple of weeks I have been hearing about a new drive-up only barbecue joint in Jackson named \"DB's Barbecue\". It started with a whisper, a quiet Facebook message from a friend encouraging me to check it out. The heat began to build as I overheard people here and there gushing about their DB's experiences, specifically the pulled pork potato skins. ...\n\nBreakfast at Whatchamacallit's\n\nMonday night was rough. I spent the majority of the evening trying to quietly slip away from a big, muscular, heavy beast who is completely and utterly obsessed with me. He demanded my undivided attention and would not keep his adoring yet overly enthusiastic paws off of me. ...\n\nThe Mudcat Coffee House serves up an easy Sunday morning\n\nHave you heard Lionel Richie's song \"Easy\"? Easy like Sunday Morning. Where did he get that idea? My Sundays are not easy. Sunday feels like a time warp  hours speed by in double-time. One minute the sun is gently waking me up then BAM! it is 8 p.m., and I am trying to finish up Saturday things while preparing for Monday things. ...\n\nA Saturday morning sensation: Gravel Dogs Biscuits\n\nI had big plans last weekend. A day trip to St. Louis with the objective of visiting a variety of establishments to feast on their culinary delights. My salivary glands kicked into overdrive, and my mouth watered as I daydreamed about the possibilities...\n\nBeat the heat with these sweet treats ...\n\nThe Dog Days of Summer \"officially\" arrived June 3 and end Aug. 11. Dog days bright and clear Indicate a happy year; But when accompanied by rain, For better times, our hopes are vain Whether you believe the folklore behind the saying or not, there is no disputing it is starting to feel as hot as Texas around these parts. People are either hunkering down in the cool AC or managing the scorching temperatures by hanging out near pools, lakes and beaches...\n\nThe Iron Whisk serves up good times and incredible flavors\n\nLast Saturday I was lured 45 minutes away to Cobden, Illinois, by the possibility of trying a limited time menu item at The Iron Whisk: The Violet Femme Dutch Baby. Their online menu describes a Dutch baby as an iron skillet puffed pancake, \"like if an omelette married a crepe and had a baby.\" The name Violet Femme is a genius nod to the band The Violent Femmes, Pride Month and the locally-grown lavender they use in the cream. ...\n\nFuel brings an elevated taco experience to Jackson\n\nIf you have been searching for a hot new place to feed your taco addiction, look no further than Fuel in Jackson. Fuel was built at the site of a former gas station, hence the name. Their menu gives a nod to the previous occupants with taco options designated as \"regular,\" \"plus\" and \"premium.\" The drink menu continues the homage with names such as \"Petrol Paloma\" and \"High Octane.\"...\n\nNavy SEAL's methods lead to love at Mama's on The Hill\n\nAmidst a fun-filled road tripping weekend around central Missouri, a friend and I realized we would find ourselves smack dab in the middle of St. Louis around lunchtime. Big cities are like buffets of restaurants  so many good options it can seem impossible to narrow it down to just one. ...\n\nBroussard's  an old favorite worthy of revisiting\n\nThis week started with a couple of creative foodie writing ideas and a few suggestions for new locales. This week, I would finally write an article that would showcase my quirkiness, creativity, silly side and love of life and food. This week, I would string words into sentences that would garner national attention and finally catapult this small town \"girl\" into the big leagues of writing fame and fortune. ...\n\nJust get on the bus, Gus!\n\nA couple of weeks ago I received a call from a friend. He popped the question. I said yes. \"Want to go hunting?\" What did you think I was going to say? Knowing him, he wasn't talking about nature or creepy crawly slithering things. He was talking about heading to Kentucky for the day to track down an elusive bottle of bourbon to add to his collection and I, like any supportive friend, was all in. No hesitation. That's how we roll...\n\nThe Anvil Saloon and Restaurant provides great food and atmosphere\n\nSpring has sprung! Flowers are blooming, we have had some beautiful bright sunny days and, God willing, we have many more ahead. My recent foodie adventure location is one you will want to jot down or make a mental note of for the next time you are in need of some open road therapy...\n\nPanaderia Oaxaquena: A slam dunk during March Madness\n\nIf there is anything SEMO foodies can't seem to get enough of it's Mexican food. Whether indulging in a special fine dining fusion of Latin flavors, one of the many popular family restaurants packed with familiar favorites, a fast food fix or a taco truck treat, the Mexican food market is booming with business, and now there is another destination to add to the list -- Panaderia Oaxaquena...\n\nStopping by Minglewood Brewery for some bib-worthy bites\n\nSunday evening a friend invited me to Minglewood Brewery to catch up over an early dinner. He is a beer connoisseur and we both enjoy good food. I was looking forward to the warm casual atmosphere complete with upbeat music and a social vibe. When we arrived, we were given the option of dining room or patio. ...\n\nPica or No Pica? The only question you need to ask.\n\nSupposedly, Monday was National Margarita Day  as if I needed another excuse to meet up with an old friend and catch up with each others lives over drinks that taste like warmth, sunshine, and summer on the rocks. We sat there enjoying each others company amid the colorful Mexican decor, laughter, and celebration all around when my past returned to haunt me. ...\n\nSweet treats and whisk-y business\n\nValentine's Day is right around the corner. While some cringe at the thought of yet another \"Hallmark\" holiday aimed at separating them from their money, others look at it as one more opportunity to spread the love. It probably will not surprise you to hear I am of the latter category. ...\n\nKimchi fried comfort food on a snowy day\n\nChicken Tikka Masala was the inspiration for my recent return trip to the Spanish Street Farmacy located in downtown Cape Girardeau. I did not realize it had been almost two full years to the day since my original visit. When I arrived, it was once again on a dreary winter day. ...\n\nThe Scoop on Speck\n\nLast week I decided I wanted the scoop on a new restaurant: Speck Pizza + Street Food. Who opens a restaurant in the middle of a pandemic? The storefront is under construction so I could not get a sneak peek. I sent a message to the Speck Facebook page hoping to get the low down on their opening date, but instead I received an invitation to Gabriel's Food + Wine to meet with owner Gabriele Ruggieri. ...\n\nPhotos of food bring back fond memories\n\nDo you believe you have a calling? Do you believe we each have our own path and purpose? Do you believe in the universe or karma? I do. I recognize what I refer to as \"God moments\" in my life, but you are free to call them whatever you like. I believe that sometimes I receive messages of validation in a loud, clear and indisputable manner. ...\n\nA taste of Chicago: Italian Beef\n\nIf you have driven down Broadway in Cape Girardeau within the past couple of months you may have noticed a black sign with bright red letters announcing the arrival of something new sharing the corner with well-known local establishments such as Shivelbines music, Annie Laurie's antiques, and The Indie House: Rufus Red Hots Restaurant...\n\nThe Blue Owl -- where dreams really do come true\n\nThis week's adventure led me to a little place called Kimmswick, Missouri, home of The Blue Owl Restaurant and Bakery. The Blue Owl story has been told by big names like Oprah, Guy Fieri, Paula Dean and her sons along with numerous shows and publications. I couldn't imagine what more I could possibly say about their signature item, the Levee High Apple Pie, but I decided to go where I felt I was being led...\n\nThe stars at night are big and bright deep in the heart of ... Frohna?\n\nWhat do winding country roads, smoky bars, beer, veterans, Harley Davidson motorcycles, a brassiere chandelier, Clint Eastwood and a couple of good old boys have in common? You can find them all at The East Perry Pub. That's what I found when I climbed into Big Red and let my GPS guide me down winding country roads and over a couple of one lane bridges Saturday night...\n\nNew Hamburg's claim to fame\n\nTake a 20- or 30-minute drive outside of Cape Girardeau to the unincorporated community of New Hamburg, Missouri. Early settlers named the land after Hamburg, Germany, and the name was updated to New Hamburg in 1866. St. Lawrence Parish was founded there in 1847 and remains an integral part of the community. ...\n\nSushi By Angel: A local pop-up restaurant experience\n\nI returned to Sedona Bistro Sunday for a one-day event they were hosting: Sushi by Angel, a pop-up restaurant. Pop-up restaurants my seem like a new fad, but the concept has been around since the 1960s when they were known as \"supper clubs.\" Pop-ups are temporary restaurants which may be quick one-day events or at a location for several months. ...\n\nStrawberry's: Good food, Grandpa and God moments\n\nLast week I did something out of the ordinary  I used a vacation day in the middle of the week to visit Strawberry's at 107 Main St. in Holcomb, Missouri. I invited a friend to come along and did something else out of the ordinary  I left Big Red at home and accepted my friend's offer to drive. ...\n\nSedona Bistro  it's all in the name\n\nWhat's in a name? Names are important. Parents think long and hard about what to name their children before they are born. As children, some of us toyed with names we would have preferred. I know I had a couple in mind for when I was a \"grown up\" and could decide for myself. ...\n\nCall your wife and tell her you're picking up Babe's!!\n\n\"It's about to go down!\" \"We love Babe's!\" Babe's is \" ... the best in the country!\" \"Looks so good!\" \"Worth the drive.\" \" ... one of my favorite stops when I'm over that way.\" \" ... smells so freakin' good!\" Those are just a few of the comments I came across when I tried to find information about Babe's Fish Wagon, which is on the Illinois side of Bill Emerson Memorial Bridge in East Cape Girardeau...\n\nI got nothin', but it's still more than I deserve\n\nHave you ever followed the rules, done everything the right way, and things still didn't turn out how you expected? If you're old enough to be reading this, I'm sure you have. There are just so many parts of this life that are unpredictable and beyond our control...\n\nParenting and peanut butter cookies\n\nThere is something special about having your adult children come home. My home is my sanctuary. It's nothing fancy, but it is where I feel most at peace and something I am grateful for every day. When my children return home it just feels different. ...\n\nBubble Crush Tea Studio  a cool spot for a refreshing drink\n\nAccording to the Old Farmer's Almanac, we are officially in the midst of the Dog Days of Summer, which means everyone is looking for ways to keep cool in the sweltering temperatures. If that sounds like you, Bubble Crush Tea Studio may be right up your alley...\n\nTrying something new at Hickory House\n\nLet me tell you about one of my favorite burgers in town. Hickory House Restaurant at 2259 E. Jackson Blvd. in Jackson. It is home to one of the best mushroom Swiss burger moments in my lifetime. In fact, three years ago today I introduced my son to his first Hickory House mushroom and Swiss burger. ...\n\nIn for a pickle? Pucker up, Buttercup!\n\nWhat comes to mind when you hear the words, \"Pucker up, Buttercup\"? If your mind immediately went to all things romantic, you probably envisioned puckering up to receive sweet kisses from the object of your affection. Gag. Take those romantic thoughts somewhere else. It's too hot outside, and I am not in the mood. I guess you could say, I'm feeling a little sour...\n\nJackson Donuts: Tell me 'bout the good old days\n\n\"Grandpa, tell me 'bout the good old days / Sometimes it feels like this world's gone crazy / And Grandpa, take me back to yesterday / When the line between right and wrong / Didn't seem so hazy\" The Judds sang that song for the masses back in 1986, and the lyrics seem especially relevant today. A song about nostalgia and simpler times yet maybe with a desire to see the past through rose-colored glasses. I guess we all want to do that from time to time. I know I sure do...\n\nDinner: It doesn't get any easier than this\n\nRight now, I am fascinated by everything pickles. In fact, I dropped a pretty penny last week scooping up various pickle-flavored items to sample before realizing I had much research left to do. I've placed my pickle ideas on the back burner for the moment, but if you have a favorite dill pickle-flavored food obsession you think I should try, please leave a comment below telling me what you love about it and maybe I will share your discovery with the masses...\n\n36 Restaurant & Bar: A Peek Inside the Glamorous Life of a 322 Year Old\n\nWhat's a woman to do when her adult children are both 16 hours away on Mother's Day weekend? If you're me, you celebrate by splurging on the fine dining experience you think they may have wanted you to have. 36 Restaurant & Bar: Table for one, please...\n\nSocial hour with sunshine and Celebrations\n\nThanks to the great variety of options available at Aldi, I have continued to try new things from the comfort of my own home. In fact, I wondered if I should share some of my favorite finds with you, such as street corn chips, dill pickle popcorn and chocolate-covered espresso beans. I decided against it for selfish reasons: I don't want all of my favorite items to disappear from the store shelves...\n\nThank you for being a friend\n\nI miss you. Yes, I'm talking to YOU. The person sitting at the table with their morning coffee enjoying the feeling of the paper in their hand. The person on their cellphone in their cozy bed. The person staring at their computer screen before getting started at work. ...\n\nLet's take a sweet trip down Memory Lane\n\nHave you or your loved ones been craving salty or sugary snacks lately? I sure have. When I'm stressed, my vice is soft drinks. Soda. \"Coke\" if you're a Southerner. It's easy to blame it on boredom, but did you know we have a physiological response to emotional stress? It includes terms like \"hypothalamus,\" \"adrenal glands,\" \"cortisol\" and \"insulin,\" and it causes cravings. ...\n\nFrom 'prison ramen' to MREs  exploring all possibilities\n\nIt's been a surreal week so far, hasn't it? News stories have piqued my imagination. I've joked with friends about conspiracy theories and sci-fi scenarios you might find in a Dean Koontz novel. We've delved into deeper serious discussions about health care, the psychology of a pandemic, and spirituality...\n\nA change of plans leads to a taste of the South\n\nAre you familiar with the saying \"If you want to make God laugh, tell him your plans?\" If you love God, you will be happy to know I am quite busy over here cracking him up with all of my big plans. One of my plans last week was to travel down south to visit a little hole in the wall restaurant and try their signature dish. I knew the trip would take up the majority of my day, so I mentally orchestrated my weekend around it...\n\nMurder at the Dew Drop Inn\n\nThe \"Dew Drop Inn\" is a great name, isn't it? The moment I read it I immediately imagined the distinctive voice of Dateline's own murder mystery king, Keith Morrison, narrating my story. The scary part was, I had plans to meet there for a first date. ...\n\nI am Wib's\n\nA former colleague's face registered disbelief before exclaiming, \"I can't believe you've never been to Wib's.\" He described Wib's using adjectives, moans and facial expressions. When he finished, I was craving Wib's, too. I was starving, and my grumbling stomach tracked the minutes until my lunch introduction to Wib's barbecue. That was three years ago...\n\nSuperFresh Kitchen, I'm so glad you're here!\n\n\"I'm so glad you're here.\" How does it feel to hear those words? How does it feel to say those words? You may say them when a loved one returns after a long absence. You may utter them after returning home from a particularly trying day at work. Some people exhale them along with a sigh of relief when roadside assistance or a police officer responds to their call for help. I know I have...\n\nA new year, a new kid on the block\n\nI had quite a serene New Year's Eve. No partying. No cocktail dress. No romantic midnight kiss to officially bring an end to Hallmark movie watching season. Just me, my faithful companion and a desire to reflect on years past while setting goals for the future. ...\n\nPainting Celebrations in a different light\n\nWe have some beautiful fine dining establishments in Cape Girardeau, such as Celebrations restaurant which has been in operation for 22 years. I've been invited to dine at Celebrations several times but have always ended up elsewhere. Many think luxury and elegance when they hear \"fine dining.\" I immediately think stuffy, pretentious, expensive and boring. ...\n\nSubscriber exclusive  When Harry Met Sandy's Place...\n\nDo you remember the 1989 classic movie \"When Harry Met Sally...\"? One of the most iconic scenes took place in the historic Katz's Deli in New York City. That was the vibe I was feeling as I visited Sandy's Place Restaurant, inside Cape Regional Airport at 860 Limbaugh Drive in Cape Girardeau, with a friend over the weekend...\n\nSubscriber exclusive  You can keep Thanksgiving, Charlie Brown and I will have the Hot Brown\n\nIn the interest of full disclosure, I was excited my turn to submit an article would fall during the coveted Thanksgiving holiday week of the Southeast Missourian. What an honor! I was intent on not writing anything Thanksgiving related because I figured we would all be tired of turkey and would be looking for alternatives. ...\n\nSubscriber exclusive  I'll Take Famous Kirby's for $500, Alex\n\nI had great history teachers in school but I had no interest in memorizing what I considered to be tidbits of trivia from the past. I wasn't a regular viewer of the TV gameshow \"Jeopardy,\" yet when I came across it on TV, I paused to answer a few questions before moving on. I admit, I do well on social/cultural type questions. Today's restaurant gave me some tidbits of trivia and a glimpse of history...\n\nSubscriber exclusive  Fried chicken salad fixation\n\nIf you've been reading regularly, by now you have probably noticed my tendency to become fixated on items at certain restaurants. If I find someone who prepares one of my favorite dishes exactly the way I like it, it is all I want to eat from that establishment. I have heard amazing things about so many other options on their menu, but this week, Jackson Deli's Fried Chicken Salad at 437 W. Main St. in Jackson is my obsession...\n\nAsk a Foodie: Hitting the Road with Big Red\n\nRelationships are built on trust. This week, my foodie adventure challenged me to throw caution to the wind, trust, and have faith. That is a pretty tall order. It was a stressful week, I was feeling a little blue, and I wondered whether I might be coming down with something. ...\n\nOne of my favorites, I'd almost like to keep a secret (selflishly)\n\nHave you ever taken a loved one for granted? I have been on the giving and receiving end of that one. I think we all have. We get so used to our roles, life begins to work like a well-oiled machine and the details blur into the background. Then, you hear the recipient of your loyalty speaking admiringly about someone else. Heck, they aren't just speaking, they are gushing like a broken fire hydrant. It's an \"If you like it so much why don't you marry it\" kind of moment...\n\nTrio  the Perfect Fuel for Heroes\n\nI have been hearing a lot of buzz about a new restaurant in town, Trio -- Plant Based Fare at 1027 Broadway Street in Cape Girardeau. If the name doesn't give it away, their website clearly describes the cuisine as \"100% plantbased. ... Comfort food with a modern flair.\" Plant-based food? Plant based food is not usually at the top of my list. However, after viewing photograph after photograph of their beautiful culinary creations, I was determined to expand my food horizons...\n\nMy Marie Restaurant: A Taste of the Islands\n\nWe have a unique new addition to the food scene here in Cape Girardeau: My Marie Restaurant. My Marie is serving up fresh Caribbean creole soul food at a location at West Park Mall. I tried it out the week it opened and have already made a repeat visit. I wasn't sure what to order on my first trip but, after receiving a little guidance from my server, I settled on the coconut veggie shrimp for dinner. It was the dish I never knew I needed...\n\nA Downtown Destination: The Cape Riverfront Market\n\nIf you are a frequent visitor to the downtown Cape Girardeau area, you probably breathed a sigh of relief mixed with excitement when you heard the Mississippi River levels had finally dropped and the floodgates were re-opened. Hallelujah. A recent source of despair for many, hopefully that rushing water is ready to return to serving as a visual reminder of tranquility, possibilities, and hope. ...\n\nAsk a foodie: All you need is love ... and an egg roll\n\nThe Beatles began recording one of their beloved hits, \"All You Need is Love\" in London on June 14, 1964. I bet they never imagined 55 years later I would be using their iconic song as an ode to an egg roll ... yet here I am. At the corner of Independence and Hanover streets in Cape Girardeau sits a little beige building. ...\n\nAsk a foodie: High Marks for Top of the Marq\n\nI'm pretty excited about today's spotlight because I have loved the Marquette Building at 338 Broadway from the first time I entered the lobby back in 2014. I was there for a business meeting, but I could not resist pulling out my camera and taking some photos...\n\nAsk a foodie: Steak with a side of nostalgia\n\nCape Girardeau is just booming with new restaurants. The new fare is what foodie adventures are made of and from the looks of it, business is good. While I am anxious to try the new spots, I think I will wait until the crowds dissipate a bit. So I wait. I recently got a hankering for a nice steak and remembered a former colleague speaking highly of Grecian Steak House at 2013 Independence St., near Walmart ... or as the locals lovingly refer to it, \"little Walmart\" or \"Smallmart.\"...\n\nAsk a foodie: Home Sweet Home\n\nThis week I was in a foodie funk. Seriously. Maybe it was the heat. Maybe it was the busy work schedule. Maybe it was a case of summer fever. Maybe it was my re-commitment to health and financial goals. Whatever the reason, I just could not get up the motivation to go on a foodie adventure. ...\n\nAsk a foodie: Chasing the American Dream: Food truck and family\n\nI'm at my computer writing this on a beautiful sunny Memorial Day. I am proud to be an American, and I can't even bring myself to type a single word about food without first expressing my deepest gratitude and respect for those who made the ultimate sacrifice to protect our country and our freedom. We are forever in their debt...\n\nAsk and Ye Shall Receive...\n\nI'm feeling very grateful to you for reading this column and for those who have stopped to say a quick \"hello\" or share their own foodie favorites when they see me in the community. You are my people (insert fist-bump). I like to think I walk around quite anonymously and under the radar so I must look like a deer in the headlights each time it happens. ...\n\nAsk a foodie: Retired police officer is keeping the heat on in Jackson\n\nFirst of all, I want to give a little shout out to our local restaurant/food community for their commitment to giving back. I few weeks ago I participated in the Theatre and Dance Society's restaurant hop. Restaurants included were: Primo Vino, Minglewood Brewery, Marco's Pizza, Baristas Coffee Bar, Ebb and Flow Fermentations, Pho 8, Bistro Saffron, Imo's Pizza, Sugar Chic Creamery, Andy's Frozen Custard, and Jimmy John's. Even Mississippi Mutt's found a way to get involved...\n\nGathering's: A celebration of food, family and life's Chapter Twos\n\nI recently had the pleasure of experiencing brunch at a little-known restaurant a bit off the beaten path. When Gathering's Catering is not planning and executing a special event, the staff is busy offering a Sunday brunch. Reservations are recommended, and after perusing the menu my first thought was Gathering's might be geared towards a more refined or pretentious crowd. ...\n\nLet's taco-bout love ...\n\nCape Girardeau residents must really enjoy their Mexican cuisine because I can think of six to seven different Mexican restaurants off the top of my head, and all of them seem to stay pretty busy. Did someone say taco Tuesday? I've mentioned some of our family favorites in previous columns, but not too long ago a respected foodie friend recommended the street tacos at Don Carlos Authentic Mexican Restaurant and Taqueria located in the West Park Mall in Cape Girardeau. ...\n\nFresh Healthy Cafe gives new meaning to the term 'hospital food'\n\nMy most recent foodie adventure took me to the hospital. I woke up on a recent Wednesday morning feeling like I was at death's doorstep. One look at me, and my doctor suspected (and later confirmed): Type A Flu. Have you ever felt so horrible you started bargaining with God?...\n\nAsk a foodie: Football, food and photo ops\n\nOne of my favorite memories involves a last-minute family road trip. In 2007, we loaded up our car and headed to Texas Stadium to watch the Dallas Cowboys play the New York Jets on Thanksgiving. We drove straight to the stadium from Cape Girardeau and arrived just in time for the game. ...\n\nAsk a Foodie: TJ's: A little something for everyone\n\nSome people have left their New Year's resolutions behind, and some are killing it. Lunch can be a challenge to plan when one person has pizza on the brain and the other has gone full-on Keto diet mode. That is the conundrum my friend and I faced over lunch one day. ...\n\nNothing fancy, just good food ...\n\nFirst of all, I want to second last week's foodie pick -- Berghoff's Cafe. My friend has been urging me to go for at least a year. I finally made the drive over to Scott City last weekend for the French toast. Good food and the prices make getting your grub on feel like a steal...\n\nAsk a Foodie: Ebb and Flow: A tasty evolution\n\nEbb and Flow Fermentations. That is a mouthful to say, isn't it? Merriam-Webster dictionary defines the idiom \"ebb and flow\" as follows: used to describe something that changes in a regular and repeated way. If you are familiar with the location of this new endeavor by head chef and owner of Celebrations restaurant, DeWayne Schaaf, you will probably agree it is the perfect description...\n\nNot your typical 'soul' food...\n\nA few days ago I was thinking about how nice it would be to enjoy a bowl of menudo for breakfast. Unfortunately, I haven't been able to find menudo locally and there is absolutely no chance of me making it. I am not picky about much, but menudo is one of those things I believe has to be made just right or... it is all wrong...\n\nWinks: The fill 'er up go-to\n\nMaybe it's just me, but I believe most of us have been there -- the infamous grub & go? Years ago it was the occasional necessity to balancing work, home and the soccer mom life while maintaining my sanity. Quick options included burgers, tacos, or some type of sandwich and chips. That's what I had in mind recently when I faced a time crunch and decided to use my lunch break to run some errands...\n\nFoodie Adventures: A Roving Dinner Party ends in 'The Bootheel'\n\nMy curiosity was piqued when I received an invitation to a \"Roving Dinner Party\" last week. According to the invitation, we would be enjoying a five course meal with each course at a different restaurant. I love trying new things and that sounded fantastic -- I was in!..."
