        "text": "Police recovered the body of former Chicago Cubs pitcher Frank Castillo over the weekend. It appeared that he died of drowning while he was out boating Sunday. He was 44. His body was found in an Arizona lake in Maricopa County, the Washington Post reported.\n\nCastillo's family said Monday that he had been with them at Bartlett Lake when he decided to take a swim. Family members said he was a poor swimmer and that a friend dialed 911 when he did not return, the Chicago Sun-Times reported. He went out with a friend on a pontoon boat and never surfaced after jumping in the water.\n\n\"Everyone who knew Frank loved Frank. We are devastated by this loss,\" Castillo's family said in a statement. \"It is impossible to express in words the level of sadness we feel due to this tragedy.\"\n\nCastillo entered the amateur leagues in the sixth round overall where he was picked up by the Cubs in 1987. He made his big league debut in 1991. He spent 13 seasons in the MLB until 2005. He played in 297 games, starting in 268. He recorded a total 82-104 with a 4.56 ERA throughout his time with the Cubs, Colorado Rockies, Detroit Tigers, Toronto Blue Jays, Boston Red Sox and Miami Marlins, CBS Sports reported."
