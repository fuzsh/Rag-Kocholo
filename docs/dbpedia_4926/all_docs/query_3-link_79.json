        "text": "Mary Castillo of Saginaw, Michigan,\n\nBeloved aunt and friend passed away peacefully at her home on Saturday, November 19, 2022. She was 92 years old. Mary Castillo was born on May 27, 1930, in LeRoy Township in Ingham County, to the late Angel and Faustina (Rubio) Castillo. She was a graduate of Saginaw High School. Following graduation, Mary began working as a sales manager throughout Saginaw, but was proud of her 22 years of loyal and dedicated service at Jacobson’s. Mary was a member of the Cathedral of Mary of the Assumption Catholic Church. Her little piece of heaven was collecting her miniatures, dolls, glass wear, and various antiques. What brought Mary true happiness and joy was spending time with her family and her friends. She especially treasured and cherished the many family gatherings and outings with her beloved nieces, nephews, and friends. Mary held a special bond with children her entire life and loved the wonder and amazement they brought to her life. She will forever be remembered for her kind and generous spirit, her one-of-a-kind sense of humor, and for truly living an amazing life filled with many beautiful memories and stories.\n\nSurviving are many beloved nieces, nephews, great-nieces, great-nephews, and friends.\n\nShe was preceded in death by her parents, Angel and Faustina Castillo; her brothers: Jesse R., Salvador, John, and Frank Castillo.\n\nHonoring Mary’s wishes cremation has taken place. A memorial service will take place at 2:00 p.m. on Saturday, December 3, 2022, at the W. L. Case & Company Funeral Chapel, 4480 Mackinaw Road. Rev. Fr. John R. Johnson will officiate. Friends are welcome to visit with the family at the funeral chapel on Saturday from 12:00 p.m. until the time of the service at 2:00 p.m. Those planning an expression of sympathy may wish to consider memorials to St. Jude Children’s Research Hospital - https://www.stjude.org/donate.
