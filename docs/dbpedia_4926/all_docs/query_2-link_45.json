        "text": "LAREDO, Tex. (KGNS) - United ISD is one step closer to naming the next superintendent.\n\nThe district told KGNS they are down to a handful of candidates.\n\nThe search for a new superintendent began after the former superintendent was terminated following allegations of ongoing sexual harassment and retaliation against a district employee.\n\nFrom 16 candidates, the pool is now down to four, according to the district’s board members.\n\nIn less than two weeks, they are expected to choose a sole finalist and potentially name him or her as the new United ISD superintendent.\n\nThis comes after an interview process that began back in June, where board members started interviewing candidates behind closed doors at their main offices located on Lindenwood Street.\n\nIt remains unclear how many candidates were initially interviewed. According to a board member, UISD’s protocol does not allow the release of candidates’ names until later in the interview process.\n\nThe district tells KGNS that the candidates are a mix of local and regional applicants.\n\nUnited ISD board member Javier Montemayor Jr. says he would like to see a candidate who is dedicated to providing good service to the district’s students, parents, and employees.\n\n“We’re looking for someone that brings stability, that brings morale, someone who has the operational and educational experience. Someone who is strong, good at working with people, and can be a good leader for our district and community,” Montemayor said.\n\nBoard member Frank Castillo adds that it’s important for the next superintendent to inspire students and teachers to become better people.\n\n“I want one who can manage and oversee a big organization,” Castillo said.\n\nThe district hired a search firm under the Texas Association of School Boards that collected the pool of candidates who applied for the position.\n\nAccording to UISD board members, a superintendent is expected to be named before the beginning of the new school year.\n\nIt is anticipated that the finalist will be named on July 17 at their upcoming regular board meeting.\n\nFor more headlines, click here."
