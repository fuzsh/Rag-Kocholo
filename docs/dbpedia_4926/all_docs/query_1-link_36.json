        "text": "Former Toronto Blue Jays pitcher Frank Castillo has drowned, his family confirmed to KVIA on Monday.\n\nCastillo was 44 years old.\n\nHe drowned in Bartlett Lake in Arizona near his home Sunday afternoon.\n\nAuthorities are searching a lake near Phoenix for the body.\n\nDivers searched for two hours Sunday in water 25 feet deep after witnesses say a man went under about a half mile from the marina while swimming off a pontoon boat.\n\nSheriff’s officials aren’t identifying the person they’re searching for. But Castillo’s family in El Paso, Texas, issued a statement Monday saying he drowned “while with his family at a lake near their home in Scottsdale, Arizona.”\n\nThe following statement was released by the Castillo family:\n\nFrank Castillo died on Sunday in a drowning accident while with his family at a lake near his home. Frank was a wonderful son, terrific brother, and an extraordinary father to his two beautiful girls.\n\nEveryone who knew Frank loved Frank. We are devastated by this loss.\n\nIt is impossible to express in words the level of sadness we feel due to this tragedy.\n\nAll of those who counted Frank as a personal friend, and to all those wonderful fans who cheered for him during his major league career, we genuinely appreciate your prayers and kind words during this extremely difficult time.\n\nWhile we may not be able to thank each of you in person, it is very comforting to know that you are with us in spirit.\n\nCastillo played for the Blue Jays in 2000, recording a 10-5 record with a 3.59 ERA in 24 starts.\n\nDrafted by the Chicago Cubs in 1987, Castillo had a career 4.56 ERA and a record of 82 wins and 104 losses with Chicago, Colorado, Detroit, Toronto, Boston, and Florida.\n\n–With files from the Associated Press"
