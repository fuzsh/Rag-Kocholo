        "text": "A Nueces County jury on Tuesday found a man not guilty by reason of insanity in a fatal church stabbing last year.\n\nMarco Moreno was accused of stabbing four people at Kingdom Acts Ministries church in February 2018.\n\nAmong them was 61-year-old Frank Castillo, who was stabbed in the chest and abdomen and died.\n\nMore: Worshipers go to court to face man accused in fatal stabbing at Corpus Christi church\n\nThe jury handed down the verdict Tuesday, after starting deliberations Friday evening.\n\nMoreno isn't free; State District Judge Sandra Watts said Moreno will next undergo a series of evaluations.\n\nA hearing will be held later in the 117th District Court, and Moreno will likely be sent to a maximum-security institution run by the Texas Department of Criminal Justice, Watts said.\n\nHe'll stay in treatment until it's determined he's no longer a risk to himself or society, Watts said.\n\nLaw enforcement has said about 20 people were at the service, which took place in a home in the 1200 block of Cambridge Drive.\n\nMoreno, 29, was charged with murder and three counts of aggravated assault with a deadly weapon. He was a member of the church.\n\nTwo mental health professionals previously found Moreno was insane at the time of the incident, something neither the prosecution or defense contested during trial.\n\nThe dispute between attorneys comes when considering whether Moreno did anything ahead of the attack that exacerbated his psychosis. He'd previously been diagnosed with schizophrenia, according to court testimony.\n\nMore: Trial starts for suspect in Corpus Christi church stabbing, mental health a central subject\n\nDuring his closing argument, First Assistant District Attorney Matt Manning argued Moreno knew his psychosis is enhanced when he smoked marijuana. He said Moreno had smoked in the weeks before the February incident.\n\n\"If you know introducing cannabis into your system may give you the prolonged effects of worsening your psychosis, then your criminally responsible,\" Manning told the Nueces County Jury.\n\nMoreno's defense attorney David Klein argued it had been proven Moreno was insane at the time of the offense and said there's no evidence Moreno was intoxicated or \"suffering from the effects of intoxication\" on Feb. 7.\n\n\"You must return a verdict of not guilty of reason by insanity because that's what the evidence in this case requires you to do,\" Klein said in his closing. He declined comment after the trial ended.\n\nManning said he thinks the jurors were given a tough case to deliberate.\n\n\"We readily concede that he had a mental illness and we sympathize with the affliction for both him and his family and for the people who were hurt by the way it sympathized this time,\" Manning said.\n\n\"However, our law has a number of different carve outs and exceptions and kind of ad hoc approaches to situations, and this is one that we felt in our estimation kind of fell on the line, so we wanted to see what the community's response to it would be,\" he continued.\n\nRelated news\n\nMore: What's next for suspect in Corpus Christi church stabbing?\n\nMore: Jury selection underway for man accused in fatal church stabbing"
