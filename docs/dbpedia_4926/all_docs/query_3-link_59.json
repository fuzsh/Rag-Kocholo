        "text": "Lawrence Castillo died Saturday morning October 31st in Independence Kansas. Larry, as known by his friends and family, was a long time resident of Independence having been married and raised three children here. Lawrence was joined in matrimony to Dixie Margaret Castillo at United Methodist Church in October of 1994. Though later divorced, the two raised three children, Frank T. Castillo, Donna Castillo-James, and Micheal A. Castillo. Lawrence has two children from his first marriage, Elizabeth Hamilton and Lawrence Castillo Jr. Larry leaves eight grandchildren and three great-grandchildren. He was preceded in death by his parents Frank T. Castillo and Mary Louise Castillo. With his passing Lawrence joins siblings, Audrey, Frank Jr., Olga, and William (Bill) Castillo in the hereafter.\n\nThe most significant feature in Larry's life was laughter. It seems that even at the lowest of times Larry could make light and enjoy life. He never met a stranger; to him everyone was an old friend. He had a story or joke for every person in his life. He forever cared for those around him, giving all he could for someone in need. Everyone who met Larry met his razzing nature, which was one of his most endearing qualities.\n\nLawrence's life and laughter will be missed in a world which can quickly overwhelm us. His life radiated insight, charity, and forgiveness. His spirit of contented happiness for life's simple pleasures will continue on for generations to come.\n\nFriends and family are welcome to join a celebration of life ceremony and viewing to be held Saturday, November 7th at Potts Chapel in Independence from 1 p.m. to 2 p.m.\n\nVisitation\n\nPotts Chapel\n\n122 South Penn Ave.\n\nIndependence, KS 67301\n\nSaturday, November 7, 2015\n\n1-2pm"
