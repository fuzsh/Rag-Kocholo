        "text": "Our beloved husband, father, grandfather, brother, uncle and friend Maximilliano \"Max\" Castillo passed away suddenly on February 13, 2023 and entered into the Kingdom of Heaven with his wife Janine by his side; he was 68 years old.\n\nMax was born on March 7, 1954, to Catarino and Manuela (Guzman) Castillo in Edinburg Texas, one of twelve children. In the spring of 1965 the Castillo family moved from Texas to Sunnyside, Washington where he continued his education.\n\nIn 1971 Max met and fell in love with Janine Handy and they married the following year on July 1, 1972 at the First Christian Church in Sunnyside. In 2022 they celebrated their 50th wedding anniversary with close family and friends. Max and Janine raised two children, Anthony and Elaina, in Sunnyside until 1990. It was then he built their home in Grandview where Max and Janine resided until the time of his passing.\n\nIn 1972 Max was hired by Yakima Rendering and he worked there until 1982. In March of 1983, Max went to work at Washington Corrugators, a metal roofing company. Max was given the opportunity to purchase the business in 1998. Max installed roofs throughout Eastern Washington, building long lasting friendships with his customers. Max obtained his Real Estate license in 1992.\n\nMax's incredible love for the Lord began in 1982 when he and Janine watched a televised Billy Graham crusade and became Christians. After this encounter with Jesus, Max started looking for a church to attend and visited Sunnyside Grace Brethren, where he was welcomed with open arms. God used Max and the gift of evangelism as he reached out to the community of Sunnyside and the youth of the town impacting their lives with the love of God. For several years Max was a huge part of Grace Brethren Church's annual National Night Out Block Party and was known for his famous corn on the cob. Max also spread the Gospel of Jesus to anyone who would listen. He picked up kids in his Suburban on Wednesday nights and took them to participate in the club ministries at the church. His energy and commitment helped grow the Boys and Girls Club, eventually needing three buses to transport the kids to and from church. He was known as the \"Bus Driver\". Max was filled with the love of God and was a mentor and father figure to many. He would take kids turtle hunting, fishing, swimming, shooting, having wiener roasts, and showing love to those who needed it.\n\nOne of Max's hobbies was \"piece-er hunting\" he loved to drive around and find old junk; in his eyes, he was finding a diamond in the rough. This drove Janine crazy. He was a jokester at heart and liked a good debate (of course he was always right).\n\nMax truly loved his family and friends beyond words. He was exceptionally generous and was the first to offer a helping hand at a moment's notice. He was so proud of his children and grandchildren and loved attending their sporting events, dance recitals, or just stopping by Anthony or Elaina's house to say hi. He looked forward to Friday's as this was his date night with Janine. Max considered his nieces and nephews his own and was referred to as \"Uncle Max\" by many.\n\nThe passing of Max has caused a huge void in our hearts, but we know without a doubt that he is in the presence of our Lord and Savior. \"I have fought the good fight, I have finished the race, and I have kept the faith,\" 2 Timothy 4:7.\n\nMax is survived by his wife Janine of 50 years, his children Anthony (Kortnie) Castillo of Prosser and Elaina (Brian) Wagner of Outlook; grandchildren Alison Dragoo, Kennedy Castillo, Charlotte Castillo, Garrett Wagner, and Sarahann Wagner; his sisters Delia Gonzales, Lupe (Ray) Rodriguez, Rebecca (Frank) Castillo, Janie (Richard) Segovia and Mary(Panfillo) Gonzalez; brothers Ralph (Delia) Castillo, Jessie (Martha) Castillo, Joe (Mati) Castillo, Catrino (Martha) Castillo, Aurillo (Maria) Castillo and Robert (Katrina) Castillo; sister-in-law's Sherry Handy, Lynn (Mike) Rees and Elise (Tom) Russell. He is also survived by several nieces and nephews. He is proceeded in death by his parents, his father-in-law Bud Handy, mother-in-law Rose Marie Handy and his sister-in-law Kathy Handy.\n\nA memorial service will be held on Saturday, February 25, 2023, 11 a.m., at Grace Brethren Church in Sunnyside. In lieu of flowers, donations may be made to Sunnyside Grace Brethren Church Youth Ministries. Valley Hills Funeral Home in Sunnyside is in care of the arrangements. Those wishing to sign Max's online memorial book may do so at www.valleyhillsfh.com."
