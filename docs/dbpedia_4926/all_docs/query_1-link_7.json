        "text": "Frank Castillo, a former Major League Baseball pitcher who spent much of his career with the Chicago Cubs, drowned in Bartlett Lake on Sunday.\n\nAccording to the Maricopa County Sheriff's Office, Castillo, 44, was on a boat with his friends and got in the lake to go swimming.\n\nCastillo went under at one point and never resurfaced. MCSO says a 911 caller said that Castillo was \"not a good swimmer.\"\n\nMCSO dive teams didn't find Castillo on Sunday evening, and due to poor lighting, had to continue searching Monday morning, around 8 a.m.\n\nHis body finally was discovered a few minutes before 2:30 p.m. Monday, almost exactly 24 hours after 911 was called.\n\nCastillo may best be described as a serviceable MLB pitcher.\n\nHe lasted in the majors for 13 years, from 1991 to 2005 (he didn't play in 2003), which is a feat in itself. He posted a winning record in just three of those seasons, and his best season was with the Toronto Blue Jays in 2000, when he posted a 10-5 record with a 3.59 ERA.\n\nBaseball-Reference.com estimates Castillo made more than $10 million over the course of his career.\n\nSend feedback and tips to the author.\n\nFollow Matthew Hendley on Twitter at @MatthewHendley."
