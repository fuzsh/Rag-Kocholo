An old friend of the Tejadas, Frank immediately visits them after his release from prison as a confidential informant, and is eventually killed by Cane Tejada through his mother Monet's command as a result.\n\nTrivia[]\n\nFrank Castillo is implied to be attracted to Diana. When he arrives at the Tejada residence, he eyes Diana and remarks on how having grown up her body is \"filled out\" after he had not seen the Tejadas for years. A suspicious Monet later tells Diana to take advantage of this to get him to reveal how he had gotten out of prison early.[1]\n\nFrank is confirmed to be a snitch when Danilo Ramirez shows the confidential informant agreement paperwork Frank signed to Monet.[1]"
