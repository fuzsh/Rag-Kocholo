        "text": "RECAP | BOX SCORE | GAME LOG\n\nTORONTO (AP) -- Frank Castillo ended Toronto's six-game losing streak, but the Blue Jays clubhouse was anything but happy with the news that Raul Mondesi might be gone for the season.\n\n\"I don't want to lose my career for two months,\" said Mondesi, who has ligament damage and chips in his right elbow. \"I want to help the team win, but I can't.\" Castillo won his seventh straight decision as the Blue Jays defeated the Texas Rangers 3-1 on Thursday night. Mondesi has been told by three doctors that he needs surgery. The 29 year-old right-fielder, hitting .272 with 24 homers and 67 RBIs, can't even straighten out his right arm. Mondesi said he can either have the surgery now, and not miss the start of next season, or wait until after the season and be out until May. He said he would see how it feels in a week and then decide. \"I want to play 10 more years,\" he said. Mondesi, on the 15-day disabled list, played a light game of catch before the game. Castillo (8-5) hasn't lost since June 1. The right-hander allowed just one run on four hits in seven innings. He struck out four and didn't walk a batter. After allowing consecutive singles to lead off the sixth, Castillo turned a double play by making a sprawling catch in front of the mound on a bunt attempt by Dave Martinez. He then threw to second to double up Royce Clayton. \"Castillo made a do-or-die move and that killed our chances for a big inning,\" Martinez said. Castillo, who barely made the club out of spring training, has been Toronto's second best starter this season. He's won seven of nine starts, and has gone at least seven innings in six of those outings. \"This is the most fun I've had in five years,\" he said. \"I feel good.\" Chris Woodward, who entered hitting .188, hit a tiebreaking two-out single off Kenny Rogers in the sixth to give Toronto a 2-1 lead. Rogers (10-9) allowed two runs on seven hits in six innings. \"I struggled to find the strike zone but I battled,\" Rogers said. The Jays went ahead 3-1 on Shannon Stewart's RBI infield single in the eighth off Jeff Zimmerman. Mark Guthrie, acquired by Toronto on Monday from Tampa Bay, struck out Chad Curtis -- the only batter he faced -- to end the eighth inning. Billy Koch pitched the ninth for his 25th save in 29 chances. Gabe Kapler's 10th homer, a solo shot in the second gave Texas a 1-0 lead. After Rogers allowed a double to Jose Cruz and a walk to Darrin Fletcher in the bottom half, Marty Cordova tied it with a single. Game notes\n\nCastillo was 1-5 after 11 starts. ... Toronto DH Brad Fullmer broke two bats on consecutive swings in the fifth inning. ... Kapler has six home runs in his last 15 games. He extended his hitting streak to 17 games. ... Guthrie took the loss in his Blue Jays debut Wednesday at Oakland.\n\nALSO SEE\n\nBaseball Scoreboard\n\nTexas Clubhouse\n\nToronto Clubhouse\n\nJays' Mondesi might be lost for the season\n\nRECAPS\n\nNY Yankees 3\n\nKansas City 2\n\nToronto 3\n\nTexas 1\n\nCleveland 5\n\nTampa Bay 1\n\nFlorida 4\n\nHouston 3\n\nSan Diego 6\n\nChicago Cubs 5\n\nArizona 8\n\nAtlanta 4\n\nSan Francisco 10\n\nPittsburgh 2\n\nAUDIO/VIDEO\n\nFrank Castillo was glad to see Toronto's 6 game skid come to an end.\n\nwav: 158 k\n\nRealAudio: 14.4 | 28.8 | 56.6"
