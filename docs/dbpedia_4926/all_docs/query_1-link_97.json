        "text": "PHOENIX — Former major-league pitcher Frank Castillo is believed to have drowned at Bartlett Lake over the weekend.\n\nAn El Paso television station originally reported that the family said he was dead, although no body has been recovered. The Maricopa County Sherrif’s Office confirmed Monday that it had recovered Castillo’s body.\n\nCastillo had gone swimming and did not resurface. He had been on a pontoon boat with a friend.\n\nCastillo lived near the lake, about 45 minutes outside of Phoenix. He grew up in El Paso.\n\nThe right-hander spent 13 seasons in the major leagues, playing for the Chicago Cubs, Colorado, Boston and Florida, among others. He retired after the 2005 season.\n\n“Everyone who knew Frank loved Frank. We are devastated by this loss,” his family said in statement."
