        "text": "NEW YORK (AP) — Will Maya Rudolph’s “funt,” aka Vice President Kamala Harris, be back on “Saturday Night Live?”\n\nSpeculation has been running hot since Sunday, when President Joe Biden dropped his election news, but the “SNL” alum is a busy actor these days.\n\nRudolph earned four Emmy nods last week for her work on three different shows: “Loot” (just renewed for a third season on Apple TV+), “Big Mouth” on Netflix and two nominations for a hosting stint on “SNL.”\n\nShe played Harris several times as a guest on “SNL” in 2019, during the 2020 presidential election cycle. Rudolph was a cast member on the NBC show from 2000 to 2007.\n\nThe “Bridesmaids” actor won an Emmy for her Harris in December 2019 during a cold open send-up of the PBS Democratic debate soon after Harris dropped out of the presidential race. She debuted the character earlier that year during a town hall bit that had her introducing her Harris as “America’s cool aunt. A fun aunt. I call that a ‘funt.'”\n\nHer Emmy-winning turn as Harris referenced Lizzo’s “Truth Hurts” with: “I just want to show you how good you could’ve had it, America. You withheld your donations, and I got tired of waiting, so I walked my fine ass out the door.” Rudolph then sang: “You coulda had a bad bitch.”\n\nCalls for Rudolph to return to the role have flooded social media since Biden stepped aside. He and Democratic leaders have thrown their support to Harris as their presidential nominee ahead of the Aug. 19 start of the party’s convention in Chicago.\n\nThe 50th season of “SNL” premieres Sept. 28. An NBC spokesperson said there are no discussions at the moment about a Rudolph return since the show is on hiatus. An email request for comment to Rudolph wasn’t immediately returned Monday.\n\nRudolph wasn’t the first, or last, person to take on presidents and other names in U.S. politics over at “SNL.”\n\nA month into the show’s very first season in 1975, Chevy Chase introduced his stumbly President Gerald Ford. Fellow original cast member Dan Aykroyd followed up as President Jimmy Carter and his “Ask President Carter” segments. Phil Hartman spoofed President Ronald Reagan, Carter’s successor.\n\nIn the 1990s, Dana Carvey morphed into President George H.W. Bush. After President Bill Clinton was elected in 1992, Darrell Hammond and Hartman split Clinton duty, leading to other presidents played by multiple actors.\n\nPresident Barack Obama was played by Jay Pharoah and Fred Armisen, with Dwayne “The Rock” Johnson appearing as “The Rock Obama” in a few sketches. President Donald Trump is a recurring recipient of “SNL” treatment, even before he was elected. Hammond, Alec Baldwin and now James Austin Johnson have become Trump.\n\nJason Sudeikis, Jim Carrey and Johnson have all played President Biden. And don’t forget Tina Fey’s Sarah Palin and Kate McKinnon’s Hillary Clinton."
