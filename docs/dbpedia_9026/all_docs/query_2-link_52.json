His dad used to chop wood with neighbor Garth Hudson of the Band and literally built the floor that Bob Dylan stood on at manager Albert Grossman’s Bearsville studios in Woodstock, NY. His mom heard Pete Seeger and Joan Baez play when they filmed a TV show in her uncles living room in Boston, and dated one of the Chambers Brothers before she met his dad. Weaned on a diet of Jackson Browne and Toots and the Maytals, some of Forest’s earliest memories are of his dad playing “Poncho and Lefty” by Townes Van Zandt and his mom singing Elizabeth Cotton’s “Freight Train”. Forest wrote songs with Rory Block when he was six years old, learned to juggle with WavyGravy when he was 9, and studied drumming with the late African master percussionist Babatunde Olatunji as a teenager. In college he played in a band with SNL star Maya Rudolph. They opened for No Doubt at the Catalyst in Santa Cruz before Forest left to study art in Spain.\n\nA pioneer of the DIY movement he recorded his first record in his bedroom in San Francisco with bassist Seth Ford Young (Tom Waits, Edward Sharpe) and toured Europe for the first time, including playing at the Rally on Dam Square in Amsterdam for the Tibetan Freedom Concert where he first met Ben Harper, Alanis Morrisette and Thom Yorke.\n\nForest’s songs mine his deep folk roots and embrace his love of gospel, soul, reggae, and country.\n\nMore information at: https://forestsun.com/\n\nRoberta Donnay: 5pm-6:30pm\n\nAward-winning singer and composer ROBERTA DONNAY & the Prohibition Mob Band are celebrating their brand new release, “My Heart Belongs to Satchmo”, on the Blujazz label.\n\nDonnay has recorded with legendary producer Orrin Keepnews and was a touring member of Dan Hicks & The Hot Licks.

The wingmen in his trio – Gator Nation’s drummer Mikey Cannon and Cliff Hugo, the trail-blazing bassist for Supertramp and Ray Charles – bring a thoughtful flow to the rhythm they put under each of Carscadden’s bending notes and blue eyed soul singing. Carscadden is a three-time winner of the North Bay Bohemian Norbays Award for Best Americana Artist and three-time winner of the Sonoma Index Tribune's People's Choice Award for Best Local Performer.\n\nMore information at: https://www.seancmusic.com/\n\nMeels: 3pm-4:30pm\n\nIn the lush landscapes of Mill Valley, California, Meels, a songwriter, discovered her voice amidst towering redwoods. Her music, infused with the charm of a small town, is an intimate journey from nature's grandeur to NYU's Tisch's Clive Davis Institute of Recorded Music, establishing her as a fresh voice in indie folk. Meels' debut album, \"Tales from a Bird's Bedroom,\" blends abstract lyricism akin to Fiona Apple with Regina Spektor's melodic touch. Produced by Peter Groenwald and Mark Campbell in Nashville, the record is an innovative and timeless soundscape, allowing Meels' vocals to navigate personal yet universally relatable themes. The album weaves nostalgia, nature, and intricate human connections, transcending mere songs into stories and confessions. Meels articulates these moments with a wisdom beyond her years. \"Time to Rise\" from Meels resonated in the ABC show \"Grown-ish,\" showcasing her ability to capture the zeitgeist. Beyond music, her voice has adorned global narratives, from a 3M ad campaign to contributing to a commercial for the Biden 2020 Campaign. In a world where the term 'artist' is overused, Meels embodies its essence—a creator immersed in shaping soul-touching expressions. \"Tales from a Bird's Bedroom\" isn't just an album; it's a portal into Meels' world, painted with the hues of her hometown's redwoods and the vibrant patchwork of experiences. It's more than a debut; it's an invitation to witness a narrative that will echo for years. Stay tuned—Meels is a name destined for recognition.\n\nMore information at: https://www.instagram.com/meelsmusic/\n\nNancy Fawson: 5pm-6:30pm\n\nBorn from the vibrant music scene of the San Francisco Bay Area, Corner Pocket (formerly, “Fawson”) is a powerhouse band that's taking the local music scene by storm.
