His experiences inspired him to work on advocating for the needs of all people with disabilities. To that end, Adith modeled his beliefs by being the first wheelchair user in his middle school marching band and helping to design a special apparatus to hold his drum to his manual chair. He was also the first wheelchair user on his FIRST Robotics team in high school and played Unified Sports (Bocce and Tennis) in high school. In 2019, Adith wrote and submitted a document called the UMD Campus Accessibility Report to the Office of the UMD President, which outlined five major barriers to accessibility present at his university. This opened the door to a campus-wide conversation surrounding disability issues. He is a member of the President’s Commission on Disability Issues (PCDI) at UMD, a founder of the PCDI Student Advisory Committee, a member of the Mayor’s Disability Advisory Committee in Salisbury, and a Peer Mentor for the Christopher Reeve Foundation.
