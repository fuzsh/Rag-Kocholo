        "text": "Delia is a country in Dark Deity.\n\nProfile[]\n\nDelia is in the center portion of Etlan, and has a calm, relaxed climate. Delia serves as the starting point of story, and Irving's motherland. Under the orders of King Varic, this country is currently at war with Aramor.\n\nCulture[]\n\nDelia is ruled by a king or queen, and follows a familial based line of succession. The current King, King Varic, ascended to the throne after his father, King Fasil was assassinated by unknown forces. Although Varic believes that the assassins were Aramorian, he has no formal proof to back up his claim. Delia places a great deal of focus on politics and government rather than religion. Due to this, magical adepts have been shunned by the country and are only valued for their military usage.\n\nNotable Locations[]\n\nSojourn- The capital and center of Delia, where the royal family and prestigious military members reside.\n\nRedhill-The hometown of Benji.\n\nAlaris- A town which serves as a way of passage between Aramor and Delia.\n\nKurch-\n\nDervin-A formidable prison-town in which Delia stores excess prisoners.\n\nCanopy Bridge-A town and bridge which borders the Dragon's Tail River, a prominent trading location for Delians. This is Sophia's hometown.\n\nCanopy-A dense, expansive forest which hides an abandoned noble manor and bandit hideout. Sloane's old home was in this forest.\n\nDuskwater- A reportedly peaceful and calm town situated just outside of the Canopy Forest. Cia and Elias lived in this town together, and served as defenders for the place.\n\nSilvergarden-\n\nHighridge-Highridge is a northern town near the Kharmont border, and holds a special appreciation for Faine, the god of oaths. The town holds an annual festival on the third week of every Duskwater, in order to celebrate Faine.\n\nBrookstead-A military academy that trained Alden, Maren, Garrick, and Irving. Although the academy had a pact to send only its' graduating class into the Delian military for a thousand years, Varic decided to violate this pact and enlist the entirety of Brookstead's student body.\n\nPlayable Characters from Delia[]"
