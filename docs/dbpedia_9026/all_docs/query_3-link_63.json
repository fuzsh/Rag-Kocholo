        "text": "Is it “theater” or “theatre”? The 1990’s or 1990s? “She said” or “She says”?\n\nEvery day (or is it everyday?) the number of writing questions that we encounter when preparing university documents grows. That’s why it is important to develop a common editorial style guide.\n\nEditorial style is the way we present ourselves to the public through written words, whether in a brochure, magazine, newspaper ad or website. Having a common style assists us in projecting a cohesive, coordinated image to the public. It also can offer a quick answer to what otherwise might prove a time-consuming dilemma.\n\nThe university's official guide for nonacademic communications, including all recruitment and marketing materials, is the Associated Press Stylebook and Libel Manual. Widely used by newspapers and magazines, the AP style is familiar to readers, easy to read and makes sense. Although some AP rules stray from those taught in English composition classes (e.g., the final comma in a simple serial listing is eliminated), this is done intentionally with brevity and clear communication in mind.\n\nFor the few exceptions that AP style does not address we use A Manual of Style, while Webster’s New World College Dictionary, Fifth Edition is our source for spelling issues.\n\nDespite the scope of editorial knowledge contained in these references, these sources do not address some issues that are unique to UofL or that are encountered frequently by the communications and marketing staff. This style guide (items are arranged alphabetically) is intended to provide an answer fast.\n\nFor questions or to suggest future revisions, contact the Office of Communications and Marketing at 852-6171.\n\nCopies of the AP Stylebook and Libel Manual can be obtained through AP Newsfeatures, 50 Rockefeller Plaza, New York, NY 10020. A Manual of Style can be purchased in area bookstores. Those who are interested in other fast and easily read references dealing with everyday writing issues should check out “When Words Collide,” by Lauren Kessler and Duncan McDonald, and “The Writer’s Handbook,” by John B. Karls and Ronald Szymanski.\n\nSuggestions?\n\nIf you have any suggestions for the Editorial Styleguide, please send them to us.\n\nBasic Guidelines:\n\nUse AP Stylebook as a first reference when UofL Style Guide does not override.\n\nNo rule overrides good judgment. There are cases when artistic license may prevail.\n\nA\n\nA&S\n\nAcronym for the “College of Arts and Sciences.” Always use the official name on first reference. On second reference in informal publications, A&S may be used if the meaning will be clear to readers. If you intend to use the acronym on second reference, let readers know this by setting it off in parentheses directly after the first official reference.\n\na.m., p.m.\n\nUse without 0s to designate hours and lowercase with periods: 8 a.m.; 11 p.m.\n\nAAUP\n\nAcronym for the “American Association of University Professors.” Always use the official name on first reference. On second reference in informal publications, AAUP may be used if the meaning will be clear to readers. If you intend to use the acronym on second reference, let readers know this by setting it off in parentheses directly after the first official reference.\n\nAbbreviations\n\nFor companies, associations, organizations, etc., use the official name on first reference. On second reference, an abbreviation or acronym may be used if the meaning will be clear to readers. If you intend to use an abbreviation or acronym for second reference, let readers know this by setting it off in parentheses directly after the first official reference: She is on staff at the Institute for Cellular Therapeutics (ICT). Part of her work at the ICT involves studying sickle cell anemia.\n\nAvoid acronyms and abbreviations that are used only within a given unit.\n\nFor all usages the University of Louisville may be abbreviated as UofL on second reference, written with no space after the \"U\" and before the \"L.\" Never use the university monogram, UofL, as a substitute for UofL in text or headlines.\n\nAbbreviate \"company,\" \"corporation,\" \"incorporated\" and \"limited\" when part of a name; do not set off with commas: the Coca-Cola Co., Rock Island Line Inc.\n\nAbbreviate \"junior\" and \"senior\" as part of a name; do not set off with commas: John Doe Jr.\n\nNote that ampersands (&) are not used in running text.\n\nBeginning with the 2014 edition, the AP Stylebook has changed its rule for abbreviating state names. All states are now spelled out in full. The only exception is the two-letter postal code abbreviations used in conjunction with a full address (e.g., KY, IN).\n\nUnited States is spelled out when standing alone: She traveled throughout the United States. The abbreviation is appropriate when used as an adjective: U.S. government.\n\nU.S. – the abbreviation is acceptable as an adjective (e.g., U.S. Coast Guard, U.S. Supreme Court); spell out United States as a noun.\n\nUSA does not have periods.\n\nSee also academic degrees\n\nacademic degrees\n\nLowercase degree names: The department offers a master of arts and a master of arts in teaching.\n\nAvoid abbreviations in body copy: Jane Smith earned her bachelor's degree in English and then went on to gain a master's in biology and a doctorate of medicine.\n\nAbbreviations (MD, JD, PhD, BA etc) can be used in lists. There are no periods in the abbreviations and abbreviations may not be used as part of a person’s title.\n\nUse an apostrophe when writing bachelor's degree, specialist's degree or master's degree but not when naming the full degree: bachelor of arts degree\n\nAcademic departments/units\n\nUse lowercase except for words that are proper nouns or adjectives: sociology department, English department or when department is part of the official, formal name: University of Louisville Department of Sociology.\n\nCapitalize names of colleges when using the full, official name: Brandeis School of Law. Lowercase when using a reference that isn’t the official name or on second reference: law school.\n\n\"University,\" \"college\" and \"department\" are never capitalized unless they part of the official name or the first word of a sentence.\n\nAcademic disciplines\n\nIn text, capitalize only proper nouns and adjectives: members of the chemistry faculty; two English professors.\n\nAcademic titles\n\nDo NOT use Dr., MD or PhD as titles. Use the individual’s UofL-related title. (e.g., Susan Harkema, a professor at UofL’s Kentucky Spinal Cord Injury Research Center NOT Dr. Susan Harkema, MD, PhD)\n\nIf a person has multiple titles, use only their primary title on first reference: David Jenkins, dean of the Kent School of Social Work NOT David Jenkins, dean of the Kent School of Social Work, professor of social work and director of the master’s in social work program.\n\nWhen using MD, PhD, JD etc. as degree listings, there are no periods or spaces.\n\nCapitalize an individual’s title if it precedes the name (e.g., \"President Kim Schatzel,\" \"Professor Smith\")\n\nDo not capitalize the title when it is used as a descriptor following an individual’s name (e.g., \"Joe Smith, a professor of history…\")\n\nAlways use \"President Kim Schatzel\" — NOT \"UofL President Kim Schatzel\"\n\nOfficial chair names are capped (e.g., “Calvin and Helen Lang Distinguished Chair in Asian Studies”)\n\nSenate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell\n\nSee also titles\n\nACT\n\nAlthough ACT still officially stands for American College Test, the abbreviation is sufficient even on first reference: ACT, no periods.\n\nAd Astra\n\nSignature sculpture at the School of Medicine.\n\nADA\n\nAcronym for the “Americans with Disabilities Act” of 1990. Always use the official name on first reference. On second reference in informal usage, ADA is acceptable if the meaning will be clear to readers. If you intend to use the acronym on second reference, let readers know this by setting it off in parentheses directly after the first official reference.\n\nadjunct\n\nAlways lowercase: adjunct professor John Thompson.\n\nadmissions office\n\nUse Office of Admissions on first reference. Use admissions office thereafter. The Office of Admissions handles undergraduate applications; the Graduate School deals with graduate admissions.\n\nadviser, advisor, advisory\n\nUse \"-er\" unless \"advisor\" is part of an official title: The U.S. Department of Labor's Fair Labor Standards Act Advisor provides employers with information on minimum wage, overtime, child labor and record-keeping requirements; She served as an adviser to the government on this project. However, \"advisory\" is the correct spelling.\n\nAffect, effect\n\nAffect is almost always a verb that means to \"influence\" or \"put on\": How this will affect her grade is uncertain at this point or She affected an English accent because she thought it made her seem more sophisticated.\n\nEffect is nearly always a noun that means \"result\": The effect upon her grade is uncertain at this point. Occasionally \"effect\" is used as a verb in formal writing to mean \"to bring about\": They wanted to effect some immediate changes in their academic policy. \"Affect\" can be used as a noun in very narrow usage, to denote certain behavior in psychology.\n\naffirmative action statement\n\nAn equal opportunity statement must be printed on all publications directed to audiences outside the university community.\n\nCATALOGS AND HANDBOOKS: The full text of the statement must be included in all student catalogs, student handbooks and official employee handbooks: The University of Louisville is an equal opportunity institution and does not discriminate against persons because of race, religion, sex, age, handicap, color, citizenship or national origin.\n\nMARKETING MATERIALS: Advertisements, brochures and other marketing materials aimed at students or potential students must include the following abbreviated equal opportunity statement: The University of Louisville is an equal opportunity institution.\n\nQuestions regarding this policy should be directed to the Office of Affirmative Action at 852-6538.\n\nAfrican American\n\nAfrican American is not hyphenated. AP style prefers Black when describing race. Capitalize Black on all references when used to describe race.\n\nages\n\nGenerally, avoid referring to a person's age unless it is relevant to your copy. Do not refer to the age of a university faculty or staff member without his or her permission.\n\nWhen age is relevant, always use numerals: He was 3 years old. Ages that are expressed as adjectives before a noun or that substitute for a noun use hyphens: The 3-year-old boy wandered off. Police are searching for a 3-year-old who wandered off from his home yesterday.\n\nalma mater\n\nThe college one attended (lowercase); Alma Mater (uppercase, in italics) is the song.\n\nalumna, alumnae (pl.)\n\nFeminine noun for a graduate of the institution.\n\nalumni\n\nMasculine or mixed masculine and feminine plural noun; one graduate is an alumnus (masculine) or an alumna (feminine).\n\nAlumni codes\n\nNoteWhen referring to alumni, add the year of their graduation to their name as an identifier. Alumni are represented by the last two numbers of their year of graduation. Do not set off the year with parentheses or commas: John Doe ’81. A comma can be used when separating multiple degrees: Sarah Smith ’99, ’02. The apostrophe faces the missing numbers. We do not use degree codes (BA, BS) with alumni names.\n\nWhen the \"19\" or \"20\" is omitted from a written year, an apostrophe is used to indicate the contraction: '87. Be aware that some word-processing programs will incorrectly insert a single open-quotation mark (the tail of the mark will be turned toward the number) rather than an apostrophe (the tail of the mark is turned away from the number), which the writer must then change manually.\n\nalumnus\n\nMasculine singular form of a graduate.\n\nAlzheimer's disease\n\nDo not capitalize \"disease.\" \"Alzheimer's\" (alone) is acceptable on second reference.\n\nAmerican Association of University Professors\n\nOn first reference, use the full name. Second reference may be AAUP or \"the association.\"\n\namong, between\n\n\"Between\" is used to show the relationship between two entities; \"among\" is used when more than two are involved: It was a choice between red and blue. It was a choice among red, blue and yellow. However, \"between\" is correct when expressing the relationships of three or more items considered one pair at a time: Negotiations on a debate format are under way between the network and the Ford, Carter and McCarthy committees.\n\nampersand\n\nDo not use an ampersand (&) in running text unless it is part of a name.\n\nEXCEPTIONS: In informal use A&S is acceptable as a second reference for the College of Arts and Sciences. Also, in a list where space is an issue an ampersand is allowed.\n\nand/or\n\nDo not use this construction.\n\napostrophe\n\nDo not use an apostrophe when forming plurals of dates or abbreviations: 1890s, 1920s, M.D.s, Ph.D.s\n\nArts and Sciences, College of\n\nA&S is acceptable on second reference in informal use.\n\nAsian American\n\nNo hyphen\n\nathletic association\n\nOfficially the University of Louisville Athletic Association; second reference, athletic association.\n\nAtlantic Coast Conference\n\nUse full name on first reference; use ACC on second reference and after\n\nathletics director\n\nNOT \"athletic\" director. Use lowercase except before a name: Joan Doe, athletics director at the university; Athletics Director Joan Doe spoke at the conference.\n\nBack to the top\n\nB\n\nBelknap Academic Building\n\nCan be referred to as BAB on second reference.\n\nBelknap Campus\n\nCapitalize Campus when using as a proper noun: The Belknap Academic Building is on Belknap Campus.\n\nbetween you and me\n\nNOT between you and I.\n\nbetween, among\n\n\"Between\" is used to show the relationship between two entities; \"among\" when more than two are involved: It was a choice between red and blue. It was a choice among red, blue and yellow.\n\nBig Red\n\nA university landmark sculpture by artist Thomas Lear, erected in 1989.\n\nBlack, white\n\nCapitalize Black and lowercase white as adjectives when referring to people, according to a 2020 AP style change on race references.\n\nBoard of Trustees\n\nCapitalize and use full name on first reference. Use \"the board,\" \"the trustees\" (lowercase) for subsequent references: The UofL Board of Trustees met to discuss the proposal. The board discussed the proposal. The trustees voted on the issue.\n\nbrackets vs. parentheses\n\nAP style does not use brackets.\n\nBrandeis School of Law\n\nWhile the \"Louis D. Brandeis School of Law\" is the official name, \"Brandeis School of Law\" is acceptable for all but the most formal usage. On second reference, \"Brandeis\" (in contexts where the law school cannot be confused with its namesake) or \"the law school\" is acceptable.\n\nBuildings\n\nCapitalize buildings that have a formal name, including the words \"Building\" or \"Center\": the Houchens Building. Capitalize only proper nouns in common references: the Interfaith Center building.\n\nUse lowercase for buildings with generic names that reflect the discipline taught or the activity conducted therein: the education building.\n\nLowercase facilities and rooms within buildings: University Club dining room. However, use figures and capitalize room with used with a figure: Room 211.\n\nbulleted series\n\nIntroduce the series with a colon.\n\nDo not use periods or semicolons at the end of each item unless the item is a complete sentence (and be consistent—if one item is a sentence, make them all sentences).\n\nDo not set off the next-to-last item with \"and\":\n\nShe said that several things led to her entrepreneurial success:\n\nperseverance\n\na sense of humor\n\na supportive family\n\nBack to the top\n\nC\n\ncampus\n\nCapitalize when used with the full name of the campus: Belknap Campus, Health Sciences Campus, Shelby Campus.

Capitalize.\n\nCODRE\n\nAcronym for the “Commission on Diversity and Racial Equality.” Always use the official name on first reference. On second reference in informal usage, CODRE is acceptable if the meaning will be clear to readers. If you intend to use the acronym on second reference, let readers know this by setting it off in parentheses directly after the first official reference.\n\ncoed\n\nCoed residence halls house students of both sexes, and coed colleges admit students of both sexes. Never use \"coed\" to refer to a female college student.\n\ncollective nouns\n\nThe collective nouns \"faculty\" and \"staff\" can take singular or plural verbs, depending on whether group members are acting individually or as a group. The French department faculty meets regularly with the Spanish department faculty. The staff sometimes disagree among themselves.\n\nWhen \"data\" is used as a collective noun that represents a unit it takes a singular verb: The data is invalid. When it refers to individual items, use a plural verb: The data were collected by a team of biologists.\n\ncolleges and schools\n\nThe distinction between schools and colleges is, in general, one of breadth: colleges consist of multiple academic units, schools of one or two. Do not call a college a school.\n\nCapitalize the full, formal names of UofL's schools and colleges. If the college is named after someone, include the honoree's last name: Brandeis School of Law.

The second half of the sentence must contain its own subject and verb: The ticket office is in the Student Activities Center, and it is open from 8 a.m. to 5 p.m.\n\nDATE: Use a comma between a specific date and year: June 10, 1964. A comma should follow the year when a specific date is mentioned mid-sentence: May 11, 1988, was the date of the party. Do not use a comma between month and year or season and year: March 1997, summer 1999.\n\nLOCATIONS: When using a city name with a state or country in a sentence, place a comma afterward: She is a Louisville, Kentucky, native.\n\nSee also semicolon\n\ncommencement, Commencement\n\nUppercase the formal ceremony; lowercase for generic usage: Maya Angelou spoke at Commencement; UofL holds commencements in December and May of each year.\n\nCommittee\n\nCapitalize the full names of committees that are part of formal organizations.

This category includes almanacs, directories, dictionaries, encyclopedias, handbooks and similar publications.\n\nTranslate a foreign title into English unless the work is known to the American public by its foreign name.\n\ncomprise\n\nAvoid using if possible, but when necessary remember that \"comprise\" means to contain or include. Use in active voice: UofL comprises 12 schools and colleges NOT UofL is comprised of 12 schools and colleges.\n\ncourse titles\n\nIn most cases, a description of subject matter rather than an official title will suffice: He teaches freshman English each fall. She developed the course on contract law.\n\ncourtesy titles\n\nGenerally omitted.\n\nSee also titles\n\nCOVID-19\n\nCOVID-19, the disease, is caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus.

For academic writing, plural verbs and pronouns are preferred. Use datum when you mean a single piece of information.\n\ndates\n\nSpell out months when used alone or with the year only: September 1991. Abbreviate the month―except for March, April, May, June and July―when used with a specific day: Sept. 2.\n\nDo not use a comma between the month and year when no specific day is mentioned: January 1994. The same rule applies to seasons: fall 1996.\n\nWhen referring to a month, day and year, place a comma between the day and year: Dec. 7, 1945.\n\nPlace a comma after the year when a phrase with a month, day and year is used in a sentence: Feb. 18, 1987, was the target date.\n\nDo not use \"on\" with dates unless its absence would lead to confusion: The program ends Dec. 15 NOT The program ends on Dec. 15.\n\nTo indicate sequences or inclusive dates and times, use an en dash instead of \"to\": Apply here May 7–9, 8 a.m.–4 p.m.\n\nDo not use \"st,\" \"rd\" or \"th\" with dates: Oct. 14 NOT Oct. 14th; Feb. 2 NOT Feb. 2nd.\n\ndean\n\nCapitalize only when it precedes a name.

Avoid the word handicap in describing a disability.\n\ndoctoral, doctorate\n\n\"Doctorate\" is a noun; \"doctoral\" is the adjective. You may have a doctorate or a doctoral degree, but not a doctorate degree: He received his doctoral degree in English; He holds a doctorate in English.\n\ndorms/dormitories\n\nAvoid this old-fashioned and limited term; use “residence hall” instead.\n\nDr.\n\nDo not use as a title.
