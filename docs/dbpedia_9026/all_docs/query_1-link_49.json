She has also interned for the U.N. High Commission on Refugees, the Council on Foreign Relations, and Vice President Kamala Harris's then-Senate office. As a 2022 Pickering Foreign Affairs Fellow with the U.S. Department of State, Maya plans to specialize in International Security before beginning her career as an American diplomat. In the MIP program, she hopes to examine the intersection of human rights and climate security, particularly as it relates to humanitarian and refugee crises. Finally, Maya enjoys traveling, stress-baking, costume parties, reading, and finding the best boba in the Bay Area."
