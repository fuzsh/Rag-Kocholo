        "text": "Professional Goals: I intend to practice full-spectrum family medicine, with a special emphasis on serving underserved populations. I am passionate about empowering patients to take charge of their health. I enjoy teaching and mentoring students in the healthcare field. My long-term goals include teaching in an academic setting. Other professional interests include global health, mental health, women's health, family planning, hospital medicine, and urgent care. Personal Interests: I would like to learn Spanish. My personal interests include spending time with family and friends. I probably watch too much TV. I enjoy weight training and love to travel. I work hard to keep my houseplants alive and aspire to grow my own garden. Professional Goals: My professional goals are centered around practicing direct primary care in urban and suburban communities. I aim to provide medical care that is not constrained by insurance limitations, ensuring that treatment decisions are driven by what the patients need. Additionally, I am committed to enhancing access to high-quality primary care for underserved local populations, thereby contributing to the overall well-being of these communities. Professional Goals: I want to obtain as much knowledge as possible in order to become a competent physician who can treat patients of all ages and backgrounds. I want to develop long-term relationships with patients and provide individualized care. My current interests include primary care, sports medicine, and office procedures. Personal Interests: I am a big foodie and I love to explore new restaurants. I enjoy cooking with my significant other as well as with my family. Some hobbies of mine include snowboarding, bouldering, barbecuing, working out and spending time with friends! Professional Goals: To become a Family Medicine physician in the great state of New Jersey. Although, Pennsylvania would not be too shabby! I would also like to become a primary that is well-versed in treatment of MSK issues using my background in OMM. Lastly, I would like to become more familiar with regenerative medicine treatment approaches such as Prolotherapy, PRP and Stem Cell. Personal Interests: I am trying to restore an 87' Ford Bronco II, but the immediate goal is to get that beast on the road. I would also like to run a 100k in the near future. Professional Goals: I intend to practice full spectrum family medicine. I look forward to the versatility in serving all populations and age groups but have a special interest in maternal/child health and geriatrics. I believe health and wellness have several layers and I aim to create constructive and positive relationships with my patients so I may remain their health advocate throughout their lives. I am passionate about making healthcare equitable and available, healthcare reforms and policy implementation, financial stewardship in healthcare, and combating health disparities. I enjoy learning about social determinants of health and hope to gain more knowledge in this area to best serve my patients. I am a firm advocate of preventative care and hope to promote awareness via health education to my patients and community. My long-term professional goals include medical education in academic settings along with clinical practice. Personal Interests: I enjoy spending time with my family, especially my daughter and re-experiencing childhood through her lens. When I’m not working, you can expect me to be traveling to a new country and experiencing different cultures. I also love adrenaline-inducing sports/activities like skydiving and paragliding. My love for travel and adventure has allowed me to paraglide in the Swiss Alps, explore volcanoes in Bali and Hawaii, chase waterfalls and geothermal hot springs in Iceland, and jump from the Stratosphere building in Las Vegas. I also have a really cool and adorable talking parrot named Dirby who I hope becomes TikTok famous and helps me pay off my med school loans. Professional Goals: Some areas I am most passionate about are women’s health, adolescent health, mental health, and patient education. I am interested in practicing clinical medicine in the urban setting. I would also like to continue working on public health initiatives. My aim is to build on my clinical research and public health background as a physician. Personal Interests: I love working out to maintain my exercise level. I also enjoy playing other sports like tennis, table tennis and badminton. I love traveling because I find seeing how people in a different place live their life fascinating and also learning their language to bond with the locals is so fun. Lastly, I love dogs. Watching some dog videos after a long day is my pick-me-up. Professional Goals: My goal is to join a family practice in an underserved community with the possibility of pursuing a fellowship possibly in sports, academic, or mental health medicine. I value the longitudinal relationship that a family physician can build with their patients, and families, and I have a strong desire to combat medical misinformation. Family medicine allows me to combine my passions for clinical education, global and local community outreach, and academia in my future practice. It is most important that I provide comprehensive and compassionate medical care to all those I have the privilege of serving. Personal Interests: I love spending time with family and friends, especially my dog! In my downtime I love playing and watching sports (although being a Toronto sports fan is crushing for the soul). I enjoy writing poetry, and teaching Indian classical dancing, swimming, and the piano! Overall, I really enjoy spending my time doing things that make me smile!"
