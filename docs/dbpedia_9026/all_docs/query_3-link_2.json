        "text": "City in Michigan, United States\n\nDearborn is a city in Wayne County, Michigan, United States. It is an inner-ring suburb in Metro Detroit, bordering Detroit to the south and west, and roughly 7 miles (11.3 km) west of downtown Detroit. In the 2020 census, it had a population of 109,976, ranking as the seventh-most populous city in Michigan. Dearborn is best known as the hometown of the Ford Motor Company and of its founder, Henry Ford.\n\nThe first written settlement of Dearborn is from the 18th century by French Canadian voyageurs who initially called the settlement La Belle Fontaine or Place aux Fontaines because of the abundant springs in the city. Therefore, Dearborn was once named Springwells, an anglicization of the French name.[4] The settlement was connected to the Detroit River ribbon farm communities and other farms connected to the Rouge River and the Sauk Trail. The community grew in the 19th century with the establishment of the Detroit Arsenal on the Chicago Road linking Detroit and Chicago. In the 20th century, it developed as a major manufacturing hub for the automotive industry.\n\nHenry Ford was born on a farm that was once at the intersection of Ford Road and Greenfield Road. Ford later built his estate, Fair Lane, and his River Rouge Complex, the largest factory of his empire, in Dearborn. He developed mass production of automobiles, and based the world headquarters of the Ford Motor Company here. The city has a campus of the University of Michigan, and Henry Ford College. The Henry Ford is the largest indoor-outdoor historic museum complex in the United States, and Metro Detroit's leading tourist attraction.[5][6]\n\nDearborn residents are Americans primarily of European or Middle Eastern ancestry, many descendants of 19th and 20th-century immigrants. The census identifies primary European ethnicities as German, Polish, Irish, and Italian. New waves of immigration came from the Middle East in the late 20th century, Muslims and Christians from Lebanon, Palestine, Syria, Iraq, and Yemen. Dearborn has the largest Muslim population in the United States per capita and the largest mosque in North America.[7]\n\nHistory\n\n[edit]\n\nBefore European encounter, the area had been inhabited for thousands of years by successive First Nations peoples. Historical tribes belonged mostly to the Algonquian-language family, especially the Council of Three Fires, the Potawatomi and related peoples. In contrast, the Huron (Wyandot) were Iroquoian speaking. French colonists had a trading post at Fort Detroit and a settlement developed there in the colonial period. Another developed on the south side of the Detroit River in what is now southwestern Ontario, near a Huron mission village. French and French-Canadian colonists also established farms at Dearborn in this period. France ceded all of its territory east of the Mississippi River in North America to Great Britain in 1763 after losing to the English in the Seven Years' War.\n\nBeginning in 1786, after the United States gained independence in the American Revolutionary War, more European Americans entered this region, settling in Detroit and the Dearborn area.[8] With population growth, Dearborn Township was formed in 1833 and the village of Dearbornville in 1836, each named after Henry Dearborn, a general in the American Revolution who became Secretary of War under President Thomas Jefferson. The Town of Dearborn was incorporated in 1893. Through much of the 19th century, the area was largely rural and dependent on agriculture.\n\nStimulated by industrial development in Detroit and within its own limits, in 1927 Dearborn was established as a city. Its current borders result from a 1928 consolidation vote that merged Dearborn and neighboring Fordson (previously known as Springwells), which feared being absorbed into expanding Detroit.\n\nAccording to historian James W. Loewen, in his book Sundown Towns (2005), Dearborn discouraged African Americans from settling in the city. In the early 20th century, both white and black people migrated to Detroit for industrial jobs. Over time, some city residents relocated in the suburbs. Many of Dearborn's residents \"took pride in the saying, 'The sun never set on a Negro in Dearborn'\". According to Orville Hubbard, the segregationist mayor of Dearborn from 1942 to 1978, \"as far as he was concerned, it was against the law for a Negro to live in his suburb.\"[9] Hubbard told the Montgomery Advertiser in the mid-1950s, \"Negroes can't get in here. Every time we hear of a Negro moving in, we respond quicker than you do to a fire.\"[10]\n\nThe area between Dearborn and Fordson was undeveloped, and remains so in part. Once farm land, much of this property was bought by Henry Ford for his estate, Fair Lane, and for the Ford Motor Company World Headquarters. Later developments in this corridor were the Ford airport (later converted to the Dearborn Proving Grounds), and other Ford administrative and development facilities.\n\nMore recent additions are The Henry Ford (a reconstructed historic village and museum), the Henry Ford Centennial Library, the super-regional shopping mall Fairlane Town Center, and the Ford Performing Arts Center. The open land is planted with sunflowers and often with Ford's favorite crop of soybeans. The crops are never harvested.\n\nThe Arab American National Museum (AANM) opened in 2005, the first museum in the world devoted to Arab American history and culture. Arab Americans in Dearborn include descendants of Lebanese Christians who immigrated in the early twentieth century to work in the auto industry, and more recent Arab immigrants and their descendants from other, primarily Muslim nations.[11]\n\nOn February 2, 2024, the Wall Street Journal published an opinion piece titled \"Welcome to Dearborn, America's Jihad Capital\", claiming that there were a large number of supporters of Islamic extremism in the area. Mayor Abdullah Hammoud said the article was inflammatory and was responsible for increased online hate speech against the city's citizens, so he increased police patrols.[12]\n\nGeography\n\n[edit]\n\nAccording to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of 24.5 square miles (63 km2), of which 24.4 square miles (63 km2) is land and 0.1 square miles (0.26 km2) (0.37%) is water. The city developed on both sides of the Rouge River. An artificial waterfall/low head dam was constructed by Henry Ford on his estate to power its powerhouse. The Upper, Middle, and Lower Branches of the river come together in Dearborn. The river is widened and channeled near the Rouge Plant to allow lake freighter access.\n\nFordson Island ( ) is an 8.4 acres (3.4 hectares) island about three miles (5 km) upriver on the River Rouge from its confluence with the Detroit River. It is the only major island in a tributary to the Detroit River. It was created in 1922 when engineers dug a secondary trench to reroute the River Rouge to increase navigability for shipping purposes, and businesses needed it to be navigable by the large lake freighters. The island is privately owned, has no public access, and is part of the city of Dearborn which has no frontage along the Detroit River.[13][14]\n\nDearborn is among a small number of municipalities that own property in other cities. It owns the 626-acre (2.53 km2) Camp Dearborn in Milford, Michigan, which is located 35 miles (56 km) from Dearborn.[15] Dearborn was among an even smaller number of cities that hold property in another state. For a time, the city owned the Dearborn Towers apartment complex in Clearwater, Florida, but this has been sold. Camp Dearborn is considered part of the city of Dearborn. Revenues generated by camp admissions are incorporated into the city's budget.\n\nClimate\n\n[edit]\n\nDemographics\n\n[edit]\n\nHistorical population CensusPop.Note%± 1860355—187053049.3%1880410−22.6%1900844—19109117.9%19202,470171.1%193050,3581,938.8%194063,58926.3%195094,99449.4%1960112,00717.9%1970104,199−7.0%198090,660−13.0%199089,286−1.5%200097,7759.5%201098,1530.4%2020109,97612.0%\n\nPopulation\n\n[edit]\n\nRacial and ethnic composition[a] Race / Ethnicity[b] Pop 2000[20] Pop 2010[21] Pop 2020[22] % 2000 % 2010 % 2020 White alone (NH) 82,893 85,116 93,884 84.78% 86.72% 85.37% Black or African American alone (NH) 1,225 3,895 4,346 1.25% 3.97% 3.95% Native American or Alaska Native alone (NH) 214 166 107 0.22% 0.17% 0.10% Asian alone (NH) 1,431 1,696 2,783 1.46% 1.73% 2.53% Pacific Islander alone (NH) 13 31 16 0.01% 0.03% 0.01% Other race alone (NH) 124 171 549 0.13% 0.17% 0.50% Mixed race or Multiracial (NH) 8,944 3,692 4,351 9.15% 3.76% 3.96% Hispanic or Latino (any race) 2,931 3,386 3,940 3.00% 3.45% 3.58% Total 97,775 98,153 109,976 100.00% 100.00% 100.00%\n\nAs of the 2010 census, the population of Dearborn was 98,153. The racial and ethnic composition was 89.1% White, 4.0% black or African-American, 0.2% Native American, 1.7% Asian, 0.2% Non-Hispanic of some other race, 4.0% reporting two or more races and 3.4% Hispanic or Latino.[23] 41.7% were of Arab ancestry (categorized as \"White\" in Census collection data).[24]\n\nIn the 2000 census, 61.9% spoke only English at home, 29.3% spoke Arabic, 1.9% Spanish, and 1.5% Polish. There were 36,770 households, out of which 31.3% had children under the age of 18 living with them, 51.0% were married couples living together, 9.4% had a female householder with no husband present, and 35.1% were non-families. 30.9% of all households were made up of individuals, and 14.7% had someone living alone who was 65 years of age or older. The average household size was 2.65 and the average family size was 3.42.\n\nIn the city, 27.8% of the population was under the age of 18, 8.3% was from 18 to 24, 29.2% from 25 to 44, 19.1% from 45 to 64, and 15.6% was 65 years of age or older. The median age was 34 years. For every 100 females, there were 99.0 males. For every 100 females age 18 and over, there were 96.5 males.\n\nThe median income for a household in the city was $44,560, and the median income for a family was $53,060. Males had a median income of $45,114 versus $33,872 for females. The per capita income for the city was $21,488. About 12.2% of families and 16.1% of the population were below the poverty line, including 24.4% of those under age 18 and 7.6% of those age 65 and over.\n\nAs of the 2012 estimate, Dearborn's population was thought to have fallen to 96,474, a decrease of 1.7% since 2010. Over the same period, though, SEMCOG, the local statistics agency of Metro Detroit Council of Governments, has estimated the city to have grown to 99,001, or an increase of 1.2% since 2000. SEMCOG's July 2014 estimate listed Dearborn with a population of 102,566.[25]\n\nEthnic groups\n\n[edit]\n\nDearborn has a large community of descendants of ethnic Europeans who arrived as immigrants from the mid-19th into the 20th centuries. Their ancestors generally first settled in Detroit: Irish, German, Italians, and Polish. It is also a center of Maltese American settlement, from the Mediterranean island of Malta. Also attracted to jobs in the auto industry, some were among immigrant Maltese who first settled in Corktown.[26]\n\nThe city has a small African-American population, many of whose ancestors came to the area from the rural South during the Great Migration of the early twentieth century.[27]\n\nThe city's population includes 40,000 Arab Americans. Per the 2000 census, Arab Americans totaled 29,181 or 29.85% of Dearborn's population; many are descendants of families who have been in the city since the early 20th century. The city has the largest proportion of Arab Americans in the United States.[28] As of 2006 Dearborn has the largest Lebanese American population in the United States.[29]\n\nThe first Arab immigrants came in the early-to-mid-20th century to work in the automotive industry and were chiefly Lebanese Christians (Maronites). Other immigrants from the Middle East (Assyrians/Chaldeans/Syriacs) have also immigrated to the area. Since then, Arab immigrants from Yemen, Iraq and the Palestinian territories, most of whom are Muslim, have joined them. Lebanese Americans comprise the largest group of ethnic Arabs.[30][31] The Arab Muslim community has built the Islamic Center of America, the largest mosque in North America,[32] and the Dearborn Mosque. More Iraqi refugees have come, fleeing the continued war in their country since 2003.\n\nWarren Avenue has become the commercial center of the Arab-American community. The Arab American National Museum is located in Dearborn.[33] The museum was opened in January 2005 to celebrate the Arab American community's history, culture and contributions to the United States.\n\nIn the 2019 U.S. Census estimates, the largest ethnic group were Lebanese Americans, and the second largest were Yemeni Americans.[34]\n\nChristian missionaries and politicians\n\n[edit]\n\nIn 2010, Nabeel Qureshi, David Wood, and two other people acting as Christian missionaries, were arrested at the Dearborn International Arab Festival. They had been handing out Christian literature aimed at Muslim believers. The four were prosecuted for breach of the peace. Police ordered them to stop filming the incident, to provide identification, and to move at least five blocks from the border of the fair.[35] After reviewing the video evidence, the jury acquitted the defendants.[36] The four defendants filed a separate civil suit against the city. Dearborn was found to have violated their constitutional rights related to freedom of speech. The city settled the lawsuit and issued a formal apology to the individuals.[37]\n\nSharron Angle, a Republican senatorial candidate in Nevada, said in an October 2010 political speech that the Arab Americans in Dearborn contributed to a \"militant terrorist situation,\"[38][39] and that the city government was enforcing Islamic sharia law.[38] Mayor Jack O'Reilly strongly criticized Angle, saying \"She took it as face value and maligned the city of Dearborn and I consider that totally irresponsible\".[38]\n\nPreacher Terry Jones of Gainesville, Florida, known for burning a Quran, the sacred book of Islam, planned a protest in 2011 outside the Islamic Center of America. Local authorities required him either to post a $45,000 \"peace bond\" to cover Dearborn's cost if Jones incited violence, or to go to trial. Jones contested that requirement, and he and his co-pastor Wayne Sapp refused to post the bond. They were held briefly in jail, while claiming violation of First Amendment rights. That night Jones was released by the court.[40] The ACLU had filed an amicus brief in support of Jones's protest plans.[41] One week later, on April 29, Jones led a rally at the Dearborn City Hall, in a designated free speech zone. Riot police were called out to control counter protesters.[42][43][44] Jones also planned to speak at the annual Arab Festival on June 18, 2011, but his route was blocked by protesters, six of whom were arrested. Police said they did not have enough officers present to maintain safety.[45] Christian missionaries accompanied Jones with their own protest signs.[46]\n\nOn November 11, 2011, Wayne County Circuit Court Judge Robert Ziolkowski vacated the \"breach of peace\" ruling against Jones and Sapp on the grounds that they were denied due process.[47] On April 7, 2012, Jones led another protest in front of the Islamic Center of America, where he spoke about Islam and free speech. The mosque officials had locked it down to prevent damage. The city used thirty police cars to block traffic from the area in an effort to prevent a counter protest.[48]\n\nEconomy\n\n[edit]\n\nFurther information: Economy of metropolitan Detroit\n\nThe world headquarters of Ford Motor Company is in Dearborn.[49] Its Dearborn campus contains many research, testing, finance, and some production facilities. Ford Land controls the numerous properties owned by Ford, including sales and leasing to unrelated businesses, such as the Fairlane Town Center shopping mall. DFCU Financial, the largest credit union in Michigan, was created for Ford and related companies' employees.\n\nOne of the largest employers in Dearborn is Oakwood Healthcare System (now a part of Beaumont Health) H. Other major employers include auto suppliers like Visteon, education facilities such as Henry Ford College, and museums such as The Henry Ford.

The public schools serve more than 18,000 students in the fourth-largest district in the state.\n\nDivine Child High School and Elementary School are private schools in Dearborn; the high school is the largest private coed high school in the area.

This served as the main library until the Ford library opened in 1969. In 1970 what became known as the Mason building was classified as a branch library. The library was renamed in 1977 after Katharine Wright Bryant, who developed a plan for the library and campaigned for it.[61]\n\nAround April 1963 the Ford Motor Company granted the City of Dearborn $3 million to build a library as a memorial to Henry Ford. The company deeded 15.3 acres (6.2 ha) of vacant land for the public library to the city on July 30, 1963, the centennial or 100th anniversary of Henry Ford's birth. The Ford Foundation later granted the library an additional $500,000 for supplies and equipment. On November 25, 1969, the library was dedicated. Originally only the library had offices in the building but in 1979, the library gave up the western side's meeting rooms for the City of Dearborn Health Department.[62]\n\nThe Esper Branch, the smallest branch, is located in what is known as the Arab residential quarter of the city, dedicated on October 12, 1953. Originally named the Warren Branch, this structure had replaced the Northeast Branch, which opened in a storefront in 1944. In October 1961, it was named after city councilman Anthony M. Esper.[63]\n\nPost office\n\n[edit]\n\nDuring the years 1934 to 1943, during and after the Great Depression, murals were commissioned for federal public buildings in the United States through the Section of Painting and Sculpture, later called the Section of Fine Arts, of the Treasury Department. They often featured representation of local history. In 1938 artist Rainey Bennett painted an oil-on-canvas mural for the federal post offices in Dearborn titled, Ten Eyck's Tavern on Chicago Road.\n\nSports facilities\n\n[edit]\n\nSports facilities include the Dearborn Ice Skating Center and the Dearborn Civic Center.\n\nTransportation\n\n[edit]\n\nAmtrak, the national passenger rail system, provides service to Dearborn, operating its Wolverine three times daily in each direction between Chicago, Illinois and Pontiac, via Detroit. Baggage cannot be checked at this location; however, up to two suitcases, in addition to any \"personal items\" such as briefcases, purses, laptop bags, and infant equipment, are allowed on board as carry-ons. There is one rail stop in Dearborn: the John D. Dingell Transit Center. Amtrak operates on the Michigan Department of Transportation Michigan Line. This track runs from Dearborn to Kalamazoo, Michigan. CSX Transportation's Detroit Subdivision, Canadian National Railway/Grand Trunk Western Railroad's Dearborn Subdivision, and Conrail Shared Assets' Junction Yard Running Track also pass through Dearborn. Most of the freight traffic on these rails is related to the automotive industry.\n\nDearborn is served by buses of both the Detroit Department of Transportation (DDOT) and the Suburban Mobility Authority for Regional Transportation (SMART) systems.\n\nFrom 1924 to 1947, Dearborn was the site of Ford Airport. It featured the world's first concrete runway[64] and the first scheduled U.S. passenger service.[65]\n\nLaunched in March 2021, SMART Flex[66] is an on-demand public transit service launched in partnership with TransitTech company Via Transportation. SMART Flex is available to residents and workers in Dearborn, Troy, the Hall Road corridor between Utica and New Baltimore, Pontiac/Auburn Hills, and Farmington/Farmington Hills to book rides using the SMART Flex app.\n\nArts and culture\n\n[edit]\n\nMuseums\n\n[edit]\n\nArab American National Museum\n\nAutomotive Hall of Fame\n\nThe Henry Ford (Henry Ford Museum & Greenfield Village)\n\nFair Lane Estate\n\nDearborn Historical Museum\n\nThe Stamelos Gallery at the University of Michigan Dearborn Mardigan Library\n\nThe Alfred Berkowitz Gallery at the University of Michigan Dearborn Mardigan Library\n\nParks\n\n[edit]\n\nCrowley Park and Field\n\nFord Field Park\n\nFord Woods Park\n\nHemlock Park\n\nLevagood Park\n\nRouge Gateway Park / Trail\n\nTheaters\n\n[edit]\n\nFord Community & Performing Arts Center\n\nFord-Wyoming Drive-In\n\nArchitecture\n\n[edit]\n\nEdward Hotel & Convention Center\n\nFord Motor Company Research and Engineering Center (under construction)\n\nFord World Headquarters building\n\nFord Homes Historic District\n\nIslamic Center of America\n\nSeveral designs are by architect Albert Kahn for Henry Ford.\n\nDearborn Inn\n\nFord Engineering Laboratory\n\nFord River Rouge Complex\n\nGovernment\n\n[edit]\n\nDearborn has a mayor-council form of government.

The former city hall was redeveloped by Artspace Projects to preserve affordable and sustainable space for artists and arts organizations.[69]\n\nPolitics\n\n[edit]\n\nDearborn has historically firmly voted for the Democratic Party.\n\nIn 2016, Bernie Sanders received the most votes in the heavily Muslim and Arab parts of Dearborn in the 2016 Democratic Party presidential primaries.[70]\n\nIn 2021 Niraj Warikoo of the Detroit Free Press reported that Yemeni Americans in Dearborn were advocating for more of a role in their city's government.[34]\n\nIn the 2022 Michigan elections there was a shift in east Dearborn (heavily Arab and Muslim) toward the Republican Party as LGBTQ+ materials in schools became a political issue. According to Niraj Warikoo of The Detroit News, \"Democrats still won the city overall by a comfortable margin\".[71]\n\nIn the run-up to the 2024 United States presidential election, mayor Abdullah Hammoud refused to endorse President Joe Biden for re-election due to the government's position in the Israel–Hamas war.[72]\n\nMedia\n\n[edit]\n\nThe metropolitan-area newspapers are The Detroit News and the Detroit Free Press.\n\nThe Dearborn & Dearborn Heights Press and Guide publishes local news for Dearborn and the neighboring Dearborn Heights.[73] The Arab American News is published in Dearborn.[74]\n\nTimeline\n\n[edit]\n\nEuropean exploration and colonization\n\n[edit]\n\n1603 – French lay claim to unidentified territory in this region, naming it New France.\n\nJuly 24, 1701 – Antoine de la Mothe Cadillac and his soldiers first land at what is now Detroit.\n\nNovember 29, 1760 – The British take control of the area from France.\n\n1780 – Pierre Dumais clears farm near what became Morningside Street in Dearborn's South End.\n\nEarly U.S. history\n\n[edit]\n\n1783 – By terms of the Treaty of Paris ending the American Revolutionary War, Great Britain cedes territory south of the Great Lakes to the United States, although the British retain practical control of the Detroit area and several other settlements until 1797.\n\n1786 – Agreed year of first permanent settler in present-day Dearborn.\n\n1787 – Territory of the US north and west of the Ohio River is officially proclaimed the Northwest Territory.\n\nDecember 26, 1791 – Detroit environs become part of Kent County, Ontario.\n\n1795 – James Cissne becomes first settler in what is now west Dearborn.\n\n1796 – Wayne County is formed by proclamation of the acting governor of the Northwest Territory.
