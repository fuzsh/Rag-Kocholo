        "text": "Embark on a powerful exploration of the human dimension of climate change in our upcoming theatrical production, \"Shades of earth-Women in the Spotlight of Climate Change\". In this thought-provoking performance, we delve into the untold stories of resilience, survival, and hope amidst the changing landscapes of our planet.\n\n2023 was a year of records highs: it was the hottest year on record, record sea surface temperatures and sea level rise, and record low Antarctic sea ice. At this point, those of us privileged enough to have been unable to imagine what climate change looks like up close and personal now likely have several examples to point to. Our future, though, is being written now. These visual projections by Climate Central, Inc., contextualized by Outrage + Optimism, further illustrate a 2070 where we reduce carbon pollution in line with the 1.5 degree Celsius target, and the world in 2070 in which we carry on business as usual. Join us in co-creating a world in which our communities and environment can thrive. #ClimateChange #OutrageandOptimism #ClimateCentral #ClimateAction #ClimateOptimism\n\nWith the increasing frequency, intensity and duration of extreme temperature events, it is essential to ensure humans in the built environments are safe during those events which can coincide with power outages. What are key issues about thermal resilience that we need to be aware of and how building technologies, design and policy can help achieve climate resilient buildings? Our open access article aims to provide some insights.\n\nNext Thursday, January 11, at NextFab, the Climate Justice Initiative is proud to present a workshop entitled The Haudenosaunee “Words Before All Else”: The Most Powerful Document in North American History? RSVP below to learn the history, present, and future of the Haudenosaunee Thanksgiving Address and how it informs Indigenous worldviews & movements. We hope to see you there! https://bit.ly/3vpK6Y6 #climatejustice #muralartsphilly\n\nSome museums are taking climate action and we need ALL cultural organizations to recognize their power to make a difference in a changing climate. \"Despite the potential, authority, and capacity to engage their publics with the existential crises of our time the sector fails to live up to its promise.\" Learn how your organization can catch up in the essay by John Fraser and Sarah Sutton in the new book Museums and the Climate Crisis. https://lnkd.in/eHDdpmVM\n\nDid you know that the US has six distinct climate opinion groups? Learn more about this with the Six Americas Super Short Survey (SASSY) from the Yale Program on Climate Change Communication. Individuals can learn more about the segment they coincide with, and museums can use the group scoring tool to learn about staff or even visitor opinions on the topic. Learn more: https://lnkd.in/gFD8YeJ\n\nScientists' voices are not getting the attention they need to, especially on climate and other critical issues. I feel is a good time to speak up. Don't be afraid. This reflection is particularly aimed at scientists seeking more meaningful career paths. If you can translate, communicate, and highlight the value of yours and others' research, you become a valuable asset. Your contribution can make a significant impact not only to businesses you work with and for, but also in addressing critical global challenges. #cop28 #ipcc #co2reduction #environment #communication #science"
