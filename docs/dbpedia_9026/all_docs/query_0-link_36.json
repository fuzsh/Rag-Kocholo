        "text": "The report looks at these important factors:\n\nTree, grass, and weed pollen scores\n\nOver-the-counter allergy medicine use\n\nAvailability of board-certified allergists/immunologists\n\nThis year’s report named Wichita, Kansas, as the top 2024 Allergy Capital for the second year in a row due to its:\n\nHigher-than-average tree and grass pollen\n\nHigher-than-average allergy medicine use\n\nFewer board-certified allergists/immunologists\n\nReport Highlights\n\nThis year’s report focuses on these topics related to seasonal allergies:\n\nAllergic rhinitis and allergic asthma\n\nClimate change and botanical sexism\n\nPollen counting\n\nAllergic Rhinitis and Allergic Asthma\n\nIn the spring, the warm weather brings people outdoors to face one of the season’s biggest problems: tree pollen. Grass pollen follows later in spring into summer. Then in the late summer and early fall, weed pollen – especially ragweed pollen – can trigger symptoms just as kids are returning to school. And some parts of the United States now have pollen year-round.\n\nPollen can cause symptoms for people with two common allergic conditions: seasonal allergic rhinitis (“hay fever”) and allergic asthma.\n\nCommon symptoms of allergic rhinitis caused by seasonal allergies include:\n\nRunny nose (also known as rhinorrhea – usually a thin, clear discharge)\n\nStuffy nose (due to blockage or nasal congestion)\n\nSneezing\n\nRed and watery eyes\n\nItchy nose, eyes, ears, or mouth\n\nSwelling around the eyes\n\nCommon signs and symptoms of allergic asthma include:\n\nShortness of breath\n\nCough\n\nChest tightness or pain\n\nWheeze (a whistling sound when you breathe)\n\nWaking at night due to asthma symptoms\n\nA drop in lung function\n\nManaging your seasonal allergies can help you keep your allergic rhinitis and allergic asthma well-controlled. Now more than ever there are a number of available and accessible options to help you find relief.\n\nWork with your doctor to include the steps below in your allergy treatment plan:\n\nManage your contact with pollen\n\nUse allergy medicines and treatments\n\nRinse out your nose\n\nAsk your doctor about immunotherapy\n\nClimate Change and Botanical Sexism\n\nClimate change is leading to longer and more intense allergy seasons.1,2,3 More exposure to pollen can trigger asthma and other allergic responses.\n\nDue to climate change, there is also an increase of carbon dioxide in the air, causing trees to make more pollen. Since 1990, pollen seasons have 21% more pollen. Tree pollen levels saw bigger increases than grass or weed pollen.4\n\n“Botanical sexism” may also be partly to blame for the increase in tree pollen. This refers to the preference to plant “male” (wind-pollinating) trees instead of “female” (fruit-, seed-, and nut-bearing trees). More wind-pollinating trees can lead to more pollen.\n\nRead the report to learn more about the effects of climate change and botanical sexism.\n\nClaritin® DiversiTree Project™\n\nDid you know that male trees produce pollen and female trees produce seeds? In 1949, the USDA provided city planting guidance dictating that “only male trees be planted.” This mandate led to an increase in pollen levels, expected to double by 2040. To help reverse this trend of planting male trees that’s contributed to allergies for the last 75 years, Bayer launched the Claritin DiversiTree Project in 2023.\n\nToday, all types of allergies affect over 30% of adults and 40% of kids in the United States. This is why Claritin is extending its mission by planting more female trees where kids need it the most—schools, parks, and playgrounds. Claritin is undertaking this initiative because they believe the world would be better if we could live as if we don’t have allergies.\n\nFrequently Asked Questions about Allergy Capitals\n\nWhat Does It Mean If I Live in an Allergy Capital Lower on the List?\n\nYou may still be greatly affected by seasonal allergies. On one or more of the ranked factors, your city may be doing better compared to other cities. For example, your city may have more allergists available compared to other cities.\n\nWhat Does It Mean If My City Isn’t Listed on the Report?\n\nAAFA’s Allergy Capitals report ranks the top 100 populated metro areas in the United States. If your hometown is near a major city, your area may be included in the metro area of the major city. For example, the Seattle metropolitan area includes Tacoma, Bellevue, Everett, and all cities and suburbs in the surrounding area.\n\nIf your city’s population is lower than the population of the 100th most populated city, then your city will not be ranked. You may be greatly affected by seasonal allergies, but your town is not reflected in the report. This is why Scranton, Pennsylvania – a city that was named an Allergy Capital for the past few years – is not ranked on this year’s report. As of 2022, Scranton is no longer one of the 100 most-populated cities. Instead, it has been replaced by Fayetteville, Arkansas, moving it off our list.\n\nHow Can I Get Relief from Seasonal Allergies?\n\nNo matter where you live, it’s hard to escape pollen. But you can manage your pollen allergy.\n\nThere are a number of available and accessible options to help you find relief. Work with your doctor to include the steps below in your allergy treatment plan:\n\nManage your contact with pollen\n\nUse allergy medicines and treatments\n\nRinse out your nose\n\nAsk your doctor about immunotherapy\n\nLearn more about managing pollen allergies."
