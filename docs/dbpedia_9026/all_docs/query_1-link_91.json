        "text": "Maya Khosla is the Poet Laureate of Sonoma County for 2018-2019 and is working on The Local Legacies Project.\n\nHer new poetry book, “All the Fires of Wind and Light,” is forthcoming from Sixteen Rivers Press in 2019. Maya’s previous wildfire and fire safety films have made an impact on communities and non-profit groups across California and other parts of the United States. In 2016, 2017, and 2018, rough-cut and final versions were screened and/or discussed at over 60 venues, including a public event held at The Sitting Room (October 14th, 2017, during the Sonoma Fires), where Firewise and related materials were presented along with a poetry reading. The poems were inspired by traditional herbs used to enhance the body’s ability to treat smoke exposure. The screenings and post-film discussions resulted in a sense of hope, joy, and also immense public support for our natural areas that are rejuvenated by wildfire."
