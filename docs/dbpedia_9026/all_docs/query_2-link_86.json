        "text": "My Career Journey\n\nI began my career as a K12 educator, teaching English as a Second Language (ESL). I love(d) the diverse cultures, languages, foods, and perspectives the students brought into our classroom. However, after a few different moves across the country and changing jobs, I needed to find a position that provided me with creative opportunities while also fulfilling my growing passion for instructional technology. I began working as a learning designer in higher education, which allowed me to stay connected to student progress and success, as well as find fulfillment in developing my own skillset.\n\nMy Educational Journey\n\nBachelor of Science in English Education\n\nNorth Dakota State University\n\nMaster of Arts in Teaching English as a Second Language\n\nSt. Cloud State University\n\nMy Personality\n\nMyers-Briggs Type (MBTI)\n\nINFJ-T\n\nOutside of the Office\n\nMy Hometown\n\nBismarck, North Dakota\n\nMy Favorite Things\n\nI enjoy garment sewing and snuggling up with a good book next to my cat, Florence.\n\nMy Favorite Quote\n\n“At night our fear is strong . . . but in the morning, in the light, we find our courage again.”\n\n― Malala Yousafzai\n\nMy Career Journey\n\nI graduated with my undergraduate degree early and had no real idea of what I wanted to do with my psychology degree and did not know there were people at my university who could help. After some reflection, I decided to pursue my master’s degree in counseling and loved mental health counseling. At the time, finding a job at that time was a real challenge so I took a position in a career center at a community college and found my calling. This allowed me to help people in a real way, relieve their anxiety, and find their own paths to success. Since then, I have taken advantage of every opportunity to gain training and degrees to help me advance and I have loved the journey.\n\nMy Educational Journey\n\nB.S. Psychology\n\nMinor in Sociology\n\nUniversity of Central Missouri\n\nM.Ed. Counseling\n\nUniversity of Missouri – St. Louis\n\nPh.D. Adult Education\n\nAuburn University\n\nMy Personality\n\nTop 5 Strengths\n\nMaximizer, Achiever, Relator, Learner, Responsibility\n\nTop Holland Interest Codes (RIASEC)\n\nSocial, Artistic, Enterprising\n\nMyers-Briggs Type (MBTI)\n\nESFJ\n\nOutside of the Office\n\nMy Hometown\n\nSt. Louis, Missouri\n\nMy Favorite Things\n\nMy favorite vacations have been to Hawaii and Ireland.\n\nMy Favorite Quote\n\n“Do what you can, with what you have, where you are.”\n\nTheodore Roosevelt\n\n26th President of the United States\n\nMy Career Journey\n\nI have been interested in careers related to education and counseling ever since I was a kid. Through processes of trial and error, reflecting on what experiences brought different levels of engagement, and continuously drawing clarity on what impact I wanted to make on those I worked with on a day-to-day basis, I decided to pursue a degree in Mental Health Counseling. While enrolled in the program, I discovered the various career paths related to counseling and pursued an internship in career counseling. I realized this career created an opportunity to help others intentionally explore and navigate their own career development process. Becoming a career counselor also allows me to help others to pursue career paths that bring them fulfillment, enable them to experience work-life balance, and have their own meaningful impact on the world.\n\nMy Educational Journey\n\nBS Psychology\n\nMinor in Spanish\n\nUniversity of South Florida\n\nMEd / EdS Mental Health Counseling\n\nUniversity of South Florida\n\nMy Personality\n\nTop 5 Strengths\n\nIndividualization, Ideation, Connectedness, Learner, Developer\n\nTop 3 Holland Interest Codes (RIASEC)\n\nSocial, Investigative, Enterprising\n\nMyers-Briggs Type (MBTI)\n\nINFJ\n\nOutside of the Office\n\nMy Hometown\n\nTampa, Florida\n\nMy Favorite Things\n\nMy favorite thing to do for fun is to be physically active, playing soccer, tennis, or training in Tae Kwon Do.\n\nMy Favorite Quote\n\n“Let yourself be silently drawn to the strange pull of what you really love. It will not lead you astray.”\n\nRumi\n\n13th-Century Persian Poet, Mystic, and Scholar\n\nMy Career Journey\n\nMy career journey began when I visited my university’s career center unsure of what I wanted to do. After several career counseling sessions, I decided I wanted to pursue working in higher education with students in a similar situation as myself. Shortly after, I was hired at my alma mater as an Undergraduate Cooperative Education Internship Coordinator. I received my master’s degree while working full-time and transitioned into a Career Counselor at the University where I was able to work with a variety of populations including graduate students and alumni. I have now been working in Higher Ed for 20 years in both Student Advising and Career Services. I enjoy assisting students in navigating their career journey, learning about themselves, and applying what they discover to their future career and professional paths.\n\nMy Educational Journey\n\nUndergraduate:\n\nCW Post, Long Island University\n\nBFA, Broadcast-Journalism\n\nGraduate:\n\nCW Post, Long Island University\n\nMaster of Science, School Counseling\n\nMy Personality\n\nTop 3 Holland Interest Codes (RIASEC)\n\nSocial, Artistic, Investigative\n\nMyers-Briggs Type (MBTI)\n\nESFJ\n\nOutside of the Office\n\nMy Hometown\n\nFresh Meadows, New York\n\nMy Favorite Things\n\nI have had some wonderful adventures including “swimming” in the Dead Sea, drinking from the Fountain of Youth, and skydiving over the Kennedy Space Center.\n\nMy Favorite Quote\n\n“Be yourself; everyone else is already taken.”\n\n― Oscar Wilde\n\nMy Career Journey\n\nNot every career journey is a straight path! While I was a student at USF, I worked several different part-time jobs on- and off-campus. Some of my best experiences in college came while working as a Student Office Assistant and later a Peer Orientation Mentor at the Judy Genshaft Honors College, as well as when I served as President of a student organization. After working my way up in retail management for several years after graduation, I found my way back to USF and the career services field. I love that the Center supports students and fellow alumni to find their own unique versions of career success.

It is a great place to take a nice walk or sit in the covered pavilion for a break.\n\nMy Favorite Quote\n\n“Whatever we accomplish is due to the combined effort. . . In my organization, there is respect for every individual, and we all have a keen respect for the public.”\n\nWalt Disney\n\nAnimator, Founder, and President of The Walt Disney Company\n\nMy Career Journey\n\nDuring my undergraduate years, I worked in a multicultural office at USF where we assisted students and organized events for their benefit. While working there, I discovered that I enjoyed working with students and helping them learn. Therefore, while pursuing my master’s degree, I searched for a job that would allow me to do something similar.

Tampa Bay became my home in 2016 when I moved down here to attend Eckerd College. Eight years and nearly three degrees later, I am still lucky to call this place my home. My prior higher academic work was mainly in admissions and student life experience. Some of the best experiences I have had throughout my academic journey surrounded internship and externship experiences. So, when the opportunity to work here in the Center in a position that would allow me to give other students the chance to have the same amazing opportunities, I was quick to grab it!\n\nMy Educational Journey\n\nBachelor of Arts\n\nEckerd College\n\nJuris Doctor\n\nStetson University College of Law\n\nCandidate for Master of Library and Information Sciences, 2025\n\nUniversity of South Florida\n\nMy Personality\n\nTop 5 Strengths\n\nAdaptability, Positivity, Connectedness, Empathy, Learner\n\nTop 3 Holland Interest Codes (RIASEC)\n\nBuilding, Thinking, Creating\n\nMyers-Briggs Type (MBTI)\n\nENFJ-T\n\nOutside of the Office\n\nMy Hometown\n\nYardley, PA\n\nMy Favorite Things\n\nI love being outdoors, whether it’s gardening, hiking, skiing, or even enjoying a good book and some sunlight.

Having never considered higher education in my career path, a move across the country changed the trajectory of my career. I have had the opportunity to work across various areas of the academy including multicultural affairs, admissions, the Vice President’s office, and now career services in positions ranging from program manager, associate director, chief of staff, and assistant vice president.

However, after a very influential and pivotal graduate assistantship and internship experience during my master’s program, I was convinced that this was the field for me. And a short stint in the private sector prior to my graduate program, helped me to realize that I wanted to pursue a career that was more aligned with my career and personal values.

To graduate on time, I changed my degree to a BA in music, but I knew I didn’t want to be a performer. Around this time, I was introduced to the idea of working at colleges and eventually decided to pursue a master’s degree where I got to experience internships in both the Conservatory of Music and Career Services. While I enjoy the different aspects of higher education, I really love getting to coach students through their career journeys.\n\nMy Educational Journey\n\nBA Music\n\nThe University of Tampa\n\nMAEd Leadership in Higher Education\n\nBaldwin Wallace University\n\nMy Personality\n\nTop 5 Strengths\n\nCommunication, Woo, Includer, Activator, Adaptability\n\nTop 3 Holland Interest Codes (RIASEC)\n\nArtistic, Social, Enterprising\n\nMyers-Briggs Type (MBTI)\n\nENFJ\n\nOutside of the Office\n\nMy Hometown\n\nDetroit, Michigan\n\nMy Favorite Things\n\nMy favorite food is sushi.\n\nMy Favorite Quote\n\n“Your job is not just to do what your parents say, what your teachers say, what society says, but to figure out what your heart calling is and be led by that.”\n\nOprah Winfrey\n\nTelevision Presenter, CEO, and Chairwoman of Harpo Productions\n\nMy Career Journey\n\nAfter completing a master’s degree in organizational psychology, my career began in the corporate sector, working in human resources departments for Fortune 500 companies across New York City. For the last two decades, I have built a niche skillset in the area of university recruiting, designing and executing strategies for hiring college students into internships and full-time positions. I discovered my passion while bringing talented young individuals into organizations to fulfill companies’ talent needs and even more so, building relationships with universities to hire their students and help them navigate the challenging world of finding their first jobs out of school.\n\nIn joining the Center for Career & Professional Development at USF, I get to work with students earlier in their career exploration journey, and I manage partnerships with employers to help them showcase their job opportunities to students and facilitate the process of hiring USF students into the workforce.\n\nThis brings my experience full circle to sitting on the other end of that exchange and now, my purpose has more significance and a broader impact, which provides me tremendous job satisfaction. Throughout my undergrad years as a psychology major, I dreamt of pursuing a profession that helped people in some way.

I had no clue what I wanted to do when I got my bachelor’s degree. This later led me to go for a master’s degree in school counseling … because why not? When I was finishing up my internship in the last semester of my graduate program I realized, “I really don’t want to do this for a career.” What do I do now? During my undergrad days I worked as an RA and during graduate school I worked in the residence life office itself. With this experience, combined with my internship experience, I made the decision to continue to work in higher education, specifically in residence life as a hall director. It was while I was in this role that I volunteered at the career services office to try and maintain the counseling skills I gained through my graduate program. Once I learned all that career services offers to students, and how to deliver them, I was hooked!\n\nMy Educational Journey\n\nBS Sociology\n\nConcentration in Criminology\n\nSUNY Cortland\n\nState University of New York\n\nMSEd School Counseling\n\nAlfred University\n\nMy Personality\n\nTop 5 Strengths\n\nEmpathy, Strategic, Connectedness, Individualization, Maximizer\n\nTop 3 Holland Interest Codes (RIASEC)\n\nRealistic, Social, Artistic\n\nMyers-Briggs Type (MBTI)\n\nESFJ\n\nOutside of the Office\n\nMy Hometown\n\nMonroe, New York\n\nMy Favorite Things\n\nMy favorite food thing to do is curl up under a blanket and read a good book.

There are two times of your life that is the most significant: (1) The day you are born and (2) The day you realize what you were brought on this earth to do. I can understand why being born is so important but I did not understand what he meant in regards to realizing what you are brought on this earth to do until I finally found it which is my passion to serve and support students.\n\nI graduated from Saint Leo University with a degree in sport management with the hopes of working in the sports industry. After working in the sports industry for two years, I realized that I needed a change and that potentially working in the sports field might not be for me anymore. So, I decided to move to Ft. Lauderdale, Florida to pursue my master’s degree, and within that time, I became a Graduate Assistant in the Division of Student Affairs coordinating and executing some of the biggest events on campus. During my time at Nova, I realized how much I loved and enjoyed working with students and I decided that this is what I wanted to do, and I never looked back. After I graduated from Nova, I pursued a career in Higher Education working in areas such as Admissions, Advising, Student Success, and Student Activities with organizations such UMA, Saint Leo University, and ThriveDX. Now that I am beginning the next chapter of my life as the Student Employment/JLD Coordinator at USF, I plan to bring my diverse experience to support the Center for Career & Professional Development and to continue my passion to serve and support our students.\n\nMy Educational Journey\n\nBA Sport Management\n\nMinor in Management Information Systems\n\nSt. Leo University\n\nMS Leadership\n\nNova Southeastern University\n\nMy Personality\n\nTop 5 Strengths\n\nArranger, Restorative, Individualization, Achiever, Belief\n\nTop 3 Holland Interest Codes (RIASEC)\n\nArtistic, Social, Enterprising\n\nMyers-Briggs Type (MBTI)\n\nESFJ\n\nOutside of the Office\n\nMy Hometown\n\nSt. Croix of the U.S. Virgin Islands\n\nMy Favorite Things\n\nI never a thought that I would ever say this but I can say that I am an author as I have contributed written chapters to three books: (1) From Letters to Leaders: Creating Impact on your College Campus and Beyond, (2) From Letters to Leaders: Redefining New Member Education and Leveraging Belonging to Eliminate Hazing, and (3) From Letters to Leaders: Leveraging your Fraternity and Sorority Experience to Land your Dream Job.\n\nMy Favorite Quote\n\n“Don’t give up.

After graduating with my BS degree in Education, my first serving opportunity was with my own children. Teaching life skills, motor skills, and eventually using educational tools to prepare them for the classroom. Later, as a teacher, l taught many technology and business classes. My favorite class I taught was Computers for College Readiness. This was a class where they learned how to create resumes, do mock interviews, interview processes and understanding personality types as they relate to careers. Now, as the Administrative Specialist in the Center for Career & Professional Development, I am able to have a small part in serving and directing USF students to use all the resources available to find their career path.\n\nMy Educational Journey\n\nBS Secondary Education\n\nUniversity of South Florida\n\nMy Personality\n\nTop 5 Strengths\n\nHarmony, Responsibility, Adaptability, Consistency, Relator\n\nTop 3 Holland Interest Codes (RIASEC)\n\nConventional, Enterprising, Artistic\n\nMyers-Briggs Type (MBTI)\n\nISFJ\n\nOutside of the Office\n\nMy Hometown\n\nLakeland & Plant City, Florida\n\nMy Favorite Things\n\nMy family is a family of traditions.

Throughout my time at Florida State, I had to face many decisions regarding my career and what I wanted to pursue. I turned to the career center for guidance and help, exploring what some different options would be. That eventually aided me in pursuing my master’s degree. During my two-year program, I worked as a career advisor and completed my internship in FSU’s career center. During this time, I knew that after graduation I wanted to work in a career center because of the positive impact the services have on students.

When I graduated, I had no idea of where I wanted to go or what I wanted to do, but I knew that I wanted to be of service to students. I have always been very passionate about education, as I have interned and worked for traditional public schools, charter schools, educational non-profits, and higher education institutions. However, I have learned throughout my time in these spaces, that my passion for education is not in a traditional sense. I believe that it is very important to equip students with and educate them on the skills, tools, and resources necessary to obtain whatever their goals and aspirations are outside of the classroom. I feel that this role is a great opportunity for me to build a solid foundation and develop the skills needed to assist students in achieving their career aspirations. It will also help me grow a knowledge base and professional network that will challenge me to exceed my goals in helping as many students as I can, both now and in my future endeavors.\n\nMy Educational Journey\n\nBachelor of Arts in Political Science\n\nUniversity of North Carolina at Charlotte\n\nMy Personality\n\nTop 5 Strengths\n\nAdaptability, Restorative, Context, Relator, Strategic\n\nTop 3 Holland Interest Codes (RIASEC)\n\nSocial, Enterprising, Artistic\n\nMyers-Briggs Type (MBTI)\n\nINFP-A / INFP-T\n\nOutside of the Office\n\nMy Hometown\n\nTampa, Florida\n\nMy Favorite Things\n\nI enjoy exploring the world around me, going with the flow, and not taking life too seriously.\n\nMy Favorite Quote\n\n“Yesterday is history, tomorrow is a mystery, and today is a gift: That’s why they call it ‘the present’.”\n\n– Master Oogway\n\nMy Career Journey\n\nWhile I was getting my undergraduate degree as a student-athlete at USF, I was uncertain about my career path, but I had several experiences that helped me find a passion for helping others.
