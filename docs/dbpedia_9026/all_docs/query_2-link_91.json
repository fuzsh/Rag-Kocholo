I have two nieces - Laken and Karsyn.\n\nName: Hadley Huseman\n\nAge: 13\n\nHometown: Ellsworth, Kansas\n\nParents Names: Clayton & Sharla Huseman\n\nSchool & Grade: 7th Grade at Ellsworth Junior Senior High School\n\nSiblings Names & Ages: Tucker (18) and Paxton (15)\n\nHobbies in school: Basketball, FFA, Livestock Judging\n\nHobbies out of school: Showing pigs, 4-H, Church youth group\n\nHow long have you been showing pigs? 6 years\n\nWhen did you start showing pigs? Where? My first show was the Ellsworth County Fair in my hometown of Ellsworth, Kansas when I was 7 years old.\n\nHow did you get started showing pigs? When my brother, Paxton, was old enough to start 4-H, he didn’t want to show steers and horses like my brother, Tucker. He told my parents he wanted to show pigs and for a cattle family, that was a BIG deal. That year, he got 2 pigs and after that I couldn’t wait to get pigs of my own. It was a long two years before I got my first gilt, Storm.\n\nWhy do you show pigs? When I first started, I just wanted something to show like my brother. Then we started meeting breeders and I really enjoy going to their farms, studying the pigs and helping pick which ones we bring home to our barn. I really just feel more like me when we have pigs in the barn, and I have a project to work with. Each pig is different and it has been fun to learn what it takes to make each look their best.\n\nWhat do you enjoy most about showing pigs? I truly enjoy every part of showing pigs, except the day I have to say goodbye to them at the end of their run. I love the families we have met and the friends I have made. It’s so fun to be around people who love pigs as much as I do!\n\nFavorite livestock shows and why: My favorite shows are Exposition, NJSA SW Regional in Woodward and the American Royal. It’s funny that these are my favorite shows because they aren’t necessarily shows we’ve done great at as far as placings go. But I guess I love them because I feel like these are great shows to learn from the best of the best and I always come home with something new that I have either watched or learned from talking to someone. I also love the contests you get to compete in at Exposition and Woodward.\n\nHow long have you been an NJSA member? I have been a member of NJSA for 5 years.\n\nHow did you get involved in the NJSA? My brother and I became members of NJSA before we went to the World Pork Expo so we could show our pigs. When we got there, we learned about the skill a thon and the livestock judging contests, so we did those that year too. We went to the awards presentation and being part of that just made me want to try my best to do good in those contests moving forward.\n\nNJSA shows and events you have participated in and years: We have shown at World Pork Expo 2 years, Exposition 2 years, American Royal 4 years and Southwest Regional 2 years.\n\nFavorite NJSA event and why: My favorite NJSA event is Southwest Regional in Woodward.\n\nFavorite NJSA contest and why: My favorite NJSA contests are showmanship and livestock judging. I love showmanship because it’s based on my skills and how I do the best I can to highlight my pig in the show ring. Even if you don’t have the best animal to win in a market or breeding class, you can still do good in showmanship. Livestock judging is something I love and want to keep getting better at. Being able to evaluate and find good livestock is a skill anyone in the livestock industry can benefit from. Even if my future plans don’t include the show ring, I know being able to identify good livestock is something I can use on my family’s ranch or other places I may go within agriculture.\n\nMost memorable moment in the NJSA: My most memorable NJSA moment was this year when I placed 3rd overall in Junior Swine Showmanship in Woodward. It was a moment I will never forget.\n\nWhat would you tell a younger member about NJSA? NJSA is a great way to meet other kids with the same passion for pigs that you have. There are contests and learning opportunities at events they host that help you continue to learn and grow in your project.\n\nAccomplishments within the NJSA: 3rd place overall Junior Swine Showmanship 2022 – NJSA SW Regional; 1st place junior livestock judging team 2021 – NJSA SW Regional; 2nd Place Novice livestock judging team 2018 – World Pork Expo.\n\nAccomplishments other than the NJSA: In 2021, my gilt, Blake, and I won Supreme Champion Gilt at the Kansas State Fair.\n\nFavorite quote: I’m not sure whose quote this is but my mom shared it with me and I love it: Believe…Believe in yourself. Believe it can happen. Believe that all of that hard work will pay off. Believe in miracles. Believe that you actually can outwork them…even if you can’t outspend them. Just believe…the day will come in your life when you will be the only one that believes, and that is all that you need.\n\nFuture Plans: I hope to keep showing pigs and doing the best I can both inside and outside the show ring. I want to keep learning and getting better at Livestock Judging.\n\nWhat do you want to be someday (career)? That’s a tough one. I’m 13 and there are so many things that I want to do and try. But today, at the top of my list, I want to be a veterinarian.\n\nName: Will Grimes\n\nAge: 9 Years Old\n\nHometown: Tifton, GA\n\nParents Names: Andrew & Lauren Grimes\n\nSchool & Grade: Tiftarea Academy 4th Grade\n\nSiblings Names & Ages: Drew (11), Mallory Jane (7), & Brooks (5)\n\nHobbies in school: Junior Pro Football, Junior Pro Basketball\n\nHobbies out of school: Five Star National Baseball Travel Team\n\nHow long have you been showing pigs?

The responsibilities I am learning and leadership skills I am learning showing pigs will stay with me for life. The many friends you make from all over is one of my favorite things. Just in my state I know that I can almost go to any town and be able to know someone from showing pigs. Those are things that will last a lifetime.\n\nWhat do you enjoy most about showing pigs? I enjoy seeing the process of getting a pig at a young age and seeing what it can become in a show season. I love a challenge, showing pigs can challenge you because every pig is different. The preparation and work it takes to show pigs is something I love.\n\nFavorite livestock shows and why: My favorite livestock show is NJSA show in Perry, GA. We get to see all of our friends that we have made from showing pigs from other states, and compete with some of the best. Its also a place to make connections with other breeders.\n\nHow long have you been an NJSA member? Four years\n\nHow did you get involved in the NJSA? Friends that we made from showing told us how fun the NJSA shows were.\n\nNJSA shows and events you have participated in and years: Southeast Regionals in Perry GA for the last 4 years.\n\nFavorite NJSA event and why: Southeast Regionals, Because it is the only one I have been to, but we are planning to attend more now that my brother and I are a little older and can be of more help with the pigs than before.\n\nFavorite NJSA contest and why: Showmanship, I take showmanship very serious. I try to make all of my pigs good enough to be my showmanship pig. I think if you are a good showman, that even in weight class it matters. A good showman can make an ok pig move up in class is what I like to think.\n\nMost memorable moment in the NJSA: When I received a banner for 5th place Novice Sweepstakes Winner at Southeast Regionals in 2021.\n\nWhat would you tell a younger member about NJSA?

I want to make it to the MLB and have my own Pig Breeding Operation.\n\nAnything else you would like us to know/include in your bio? I am very thankful for the supporting parents my siblings and I have. They make it possible for us to be involved in sports and showing livestock. The adventures we get to go on because of that is something a lot of kids will never experience.\n\nName: Amanda Carter\n\nAge: 17\n\nHometown: Kennewick, WA\n\nParents Names: Josh and Amy Carter\n\nSchool & Grade: Kennewick High School, 12th Grade\n\nSiblings Names & Ages: Caitlyn Carter, 20\n\nHobbies in school:\n\nI enjoy playing soccer and participating in FFA activities in school.\n\nHobbies out of school:\n\nOutside of school I like hanging out with friends, taking care of and showing my pigs.\n\nHow long have you been showing pigs?\n\nI have been showing pigs for 5 years.\n\nWhen did you start showing pigs?

I have shown in Arizona in 2018, 2019 and 2021. It is always a fun, competitive show. I enjoy competing with other kids from all over. Showing at The Exposition in 2021 was an awesome experience. I enjoyed traveling across the country with my pigs and watching high caliber pigs compete.\n\nHow long have you been an NJSA member?\n\nI have been an NJSA member for 3 years.\n\nHow did you get involved in the NJSA?\n\nI got involved with NJSA when I started showing purebred pigs for Russell Pedrett with Ottenwalter Showpigs. He encouraged us to attend and show purebreds and crossbreds at the NJSA shows.\n\nNJSA shows and events you have participated in and years:\n\n2019 Western Regional\n\n2020 Western Regional\n\n2021 The Exposition\n\nFavorite NJSA event and why:\n\nThe Western Regional is my favorite NJSA event. I enjoy showing purebreds and crossbreds at the show.\n\nFavorite NJSA contest and why:\n\nMy favorite NJSA contest is the skillathon. The contest challenges me to use my knowledge about many topics about swine and the industry.\n\nMost memorable moment in the NJSA:\n\nMy most memorable moment was winning Champion Landrace Barrow at the 2019 Western Regional. That barrow was quite the challenge!\n\nWhat would you tell a younger member about NJSA?\n\nNJSA is a great organization to be a part of if you have an interest in showing pigs and being a part of the swine industry. The industry needs young people to teach others about its importance.\n\nAccomplishments within the NJSA:\n\nMy greatest accomplishment was winning Champion Landrace Barrow at the 2019 Western Regional.\n\nAccomplishments other than the NJSA:\n\nAt Arizona National Livestock Show I won Champion York Gilt in 2021. It was a great surprise! In 2019 at Arizona I was 4th overall Intermediate Showman. In 2022 I was Supreme Showman at the West Coast National Swine Show. It is awesome to be acknowledged for both having great stock but also for knowing how to show them.\n\nFavorite quote:\n\n“Animals are such agreeable friends – they ask no questions, they pass no criticisms.” – George Elliott\n\nFuture Plans:\n\nAfter my senior year in high school I plan to go to college. I have not decided where but will be applying to some that have good Ag Programs. I am interested in majoring in Animal Nutrition.\n\nWhat do you want to be someday (career)?\n\nAfter college and possibly earning a master’s degree I hope to work in the Animal Nutrition field.\n\nName: Ty Jones\n\nAge: 15\n\nHometown: Scottsville, Kentucky\n\nParents Names: Bart and Sarah Jones\n\nSchool & Grade: Allen County-Scottsville High School – 10th Grade\n\nSiblings Names & Ages: none\n\nHobbies in school: FFA (Leadership Committee Chair), BETA, DECA\n\nHobbies out of school: 4-H, Exhibiting livestock, hunting, and fishing\n\nHow long have you been showing pigs? 7 years\n\nWhen did you start showing pigs?

We cannot bring live hogs onto the farm. Any pigs I show, I have raised. I have made progress with my show pigs by using ‘show pig’ semen. Another unique fact is that my show pigs can only be shown at one show, as I cannot take them back home with me. I enjoy the full life cycle of the show pig experience!\n\nName: My name is Jayden Yokom\n\nAge: I am 16 years old\n\nHometown: I live in Smartsville, CA\n\nParents Names: My parents’ names are Jamie and Russ\n\nSchool & Grade: I attend Nevada Union High school and am a Junior this year\n\nSiblings Names & Ages: I have five siblings, Krystle who is 34, Ryan who is 29, Kyle who is 27, Ashlyn who is 26 and lastly Blake who is 23\n\nHobbies in school: My hobbies include being an FFA officer and sports such as tennis\n\nHobbies out of school: I am a 4-H ambassador, I show pigs, goats, and lambs, and I especially love helping with community service.\n\nHow long have you been showing pigs? This is my seventh year\n\nWhen did you start showing pigs? Where? I started at nine and was just a county fair kid for four years.\n\nHow did you get started showing pigs? I truly had the passion but didn’t know how to get further in the industry until I had someone help give me a step up and show me how much more there was in showing livestock and in the livestock industry.\n\nWhy do you show pigs? I show pigs because I have a passion for livestock and the moments that come with it. While it’s you're with friends or just the amazing feeling of being in the ring.\n\nWhat do you enjoy most about showing pigs? What I enjoy the most about pigs is the feeling of accomplishment, that you raised this amazing animal and now get to showcase all of your hard work and dedication.\n\nFavorite livestock shows and why: My favorite livestock shows are the ones that have fun games and where all your friends are there. And when you get to know or become friends with someone new.\n\nHow long have you been an NJSA member? I have now been an NJSA member for three years now.\n\nHow did you get involved in the NJSA? I wanted to spend more time in the livestock ring and NJSA shows are the perfect way to do it. I also love the leadership aspect and it really brought me in.\n\nNJSA shows and events you have participated in and years: NJSA western regional for three times, Kentucky for two\n\nFavorite NJSA event and why: Kentucky because I feel the most welcomed, have the most fun, and meet the most people.\n\nFavorite NJSA contest and why: Skillathons, because it helps test my knowledge and gives me an ever bigger knowledge that I can pass on to others.\n\nMost memorable moment in the NJSA: When I got to win my first ever NJSA banner last year and take a picture with Maddison Kelly\n\nWhat would you tell a younger member about NJSA? The best advice I could give is it’s up to you to make the most of the show, it’s up to you whether you feel accomplished with coming back with a sixth placed ribbon knowing you gave it your all.

In addition to that I want to constantly stay involved in 4-H and FFA kids' lives and help as much as possible!\n\nWhat do you want to be someday (career)? I would like to be a large animal vet and also become a exotic veterinarian because currently in my area and in general we are having a shortage. I know ever little girl wants to be a veterinarian but my passion is caring for animals as well as helping wherever I can so that’s why I would want to have a career as a large animal veterinarian.\n\nAnything else you would like us to know/include in your bio? One thing I would like you to know and is a very big pet peeve of mine is don’t bring other showmen down. Our industry needs to continue to bring strong, hard working kids into agriculture. One way to do that is reach out to others and tell them good job, tell them congratulations, or even a small comment like hey you did a good job or I like your pig. If we start doing this more often rather than saying oh well they cheated or the judge didn’t know what he was talking about then we can really help make this industry even stronger than what it already is.\n\nName: Grace Ahrens\n\nAge: 16\n\nHometown: Canal Winchester Ohio\n\nParents Names: Steve Ahrens, Erin Ahrens\n\nSchool & Grade:Junior at Hilliard Bradley Highschool\n\nSiblings Names & Ages:Matthew Ahrens, 15\n\nHobbies in school:\n\nVolleyball, Hope squad (suicide awareness organization), National Honor Society, Interact Club\n\nHobbies out of school:\n\nShowing pigs, showing goats, creating content for Ahrens Family Farms, 4H Camp Counselor, 4H\n\nHow long have you been showing pigs?\n\nSince I was 4, so almost 13 years now\n\nWhen did you start showing pigs? Where?\n\nI started showing when I was 4. I just remember getting in the car with some fancy clothes on and being put in a holding pen with someone's pig at a jackpot show.\n\nHow did you get started showing pigs?\n\nI started showing pigs through my grandpa and uncle. My dad grew up raising pigs and my uncle and grandpa still do. My dad moved to a big city going into college, leaving that life behind. When I was about four my family noticed that the farm life peaked my young mind. Later that summer I just started showing.\n\nWhy do you show pigs?\n\nI show pigs because it is like therapy for me. Whether I am out every night preparing for the next show or physically in the show ring, that time allows me to forget about the real world and enjoy the moment.\n\nWhat do you enjoy most about showing pigs?\n\nI enjoy the thrill and experiences. Never would I have expected to travel around the nation to show pigs. I've now been to so many new places just to show. But, the best part is being in the holding pen, feeling the adrenaline rush and then stepping into the ring and just being in the moment.\n\nFavorite livestock show and why:\n\nMy favorite show would definitely have to be Summer Spectacular. One of my favorite memories I've ever experienced while showing was at that show. The first time I'd ever been top 5 for a breed at a national show. Just being in louisville brings back so many memories of that show. The water park next door isn't too shabby either!\n\nHow long have you been an NJSA member?\n\nThis is going on my third year of being a member.\n\nHow did you get involved in the NJSA?\n\nI got involved in NJSA when I just wanted more. Don’t get me wrong, I absolutely love county fair, state fair and jackpots but there is a certain feeling you get competing nationally. When it was time to step it up, NJSA had the whole list of my options ready to go.\n\nNJSA shows and events you have participated in and years:\n\nThe Exposition and Summer Type Conference\n\n.\n\nFavorite NJSA event and why:\n\nDefinitely Summer Type. All the memories and contests that are offered. My first time there I actually signed up for a speech contest. I can tell you I had absolutely no idea what I was doing but, it was so fun just getting to compete in it.\n\nFavorite NJSA contest and why:\n\nMy favorite contest would definitely be the unprepared speech. I love to talk and that thirty minutes they give you to prepare about a random topic is fun for me. It's a great challenge too.\n\nMost memorable moment in the NJSA:\n\nMy most memorable moment would definitely be the first time I placed top 5 overall for a breed. I was actually there with my aunt, uncle and my “show dad” while my parents stayed home. I spent most of the day independently working on my pig “Shammy” and getting her ready. Every so often someone would check up on me but I got to be independent. When it came time to show and the judge placed Shammy and I in the top 5, it was a feeling I'll never forget. I knew at that moment all my hardwork had paid off.\n\nWhat would you tell a younger member about NJSA?\n\nI would tell a younger member to get involved. All these shows are about having fun and gaining new experiences. Go sign up for a new contest, even if you don't feel comfortable doing a knowledge contest, participate in something like an art contest.\n\nAccomplishments within the NJSA:\n\n5th Overall Spot gilt 2021 Summer Type Conference\n\nAccomplishments other than the NJSA:\n\nLast year I was definitely able to accomplish a lot. In 2021 I was Honor Roll Student, Student of the year, Department award winner… Ohio State Fair- Reserve Champion Spot Gilt, 10th Overall Breeding Gilt, 5th Overall Senior Breeding Gilt Showman. Fairfield County Fair- Grand Overall Market Hog, Grand Champion Gilt, Reserve Champion Gilt, Overall Swine Showman, Premier Exhibitor.\n\nFavorite quote:\n\n“Becoming self-sufficient and independent was an important ambition for me to have and it is still the thing I am most proud of…” -Erin O’Connor\n\nFuture Plans:\n\nI plan to continue showing pigs the next few years and also plan to pick out a college later this year.\n\nWhat do you want to be someday?\n\nI plan on being a Veterinary Pathologist!\n\nAnything else you would like us to know/include in your bio?\n\nMy younger self promised my older self that I would never show a pig with floppy ears. Here I am 13 years later and spots are my favorite breed.\n\nName: Jacksen Clarie Mills\n\nAge: 16 years old\n\nHometown: Dade City, Florida\n\nParents Names: Jamie & Stacy Mills\n\nSchool & Grade: Homeschooled / 10th grade\n\nSiblings Names & Ages:\n\nLandry Mills / 22 years old, Jadyn Mills / 19 years old & Jordan Mills / 13 years old\n\nHobbies:\n\nI love hanging out with friends and family, 4-H, traveling, Florida Junior Swine Cricut and showing pigs!\n\nWhen did you start showing pigs? Where?\n\nI started showing at my local county fair (Pasco County Fair) at the age of 13.\n\nHow did you start showing pigs?\n\nMy cousin started showing pigs and I attended one of his shows and immediately fell in love and knew this was something I wanted to do.\n\nWhy do you show pigs?\n\nWhen I first started showing pigs, I was excited to get in the ring, but I never knew it was going to teach me so much more. It has taught me how to be a humble winner and graceful loser and there is much more to showing than just what people see on the outside. It's about the lifelong friendships, being a leader in and out of the ring, learning many life lessons, and all the countless memories you make.\n\nWhat do you enjoy most about showing?\n\nI enjoy so many things that come with raising and training each of my pigs. I love getting to know my pig, working with them as a team and watching all our hard work succeed inside the ring. I really enjoy spending time in the barn with my friends and family, travelling to shows all over Florida with the Florida Junior Swine Circuit and learning about genetics, feeding, notching, skin, diseases and more. Showing is something I put my entire heart and soul into and have a true passion for. I couldn’t imagine it not being a part of my life.\n\nHow long have you been an NJSA member?\n\nI have been a NJSA member for the past two years.\n\nHow did you get involved as an NJSA?\n\nThis past summer I went to my first NJSA show in Louisville, Kentucky and was amazed at how many people and pigs. I immediately couldn’t wait to do more.\n\nNJSA shows and event you’ve participated in and years:\n\nI haven't done many but I'm looking forward to more in the years to come. Summer Spectacular, Louisville Kentucky 2021 Southeast Regional, Perry Georgia 2022\n\nFavorite NJSA event and why?\n\nMy favorite NJSA event was definitely Southeast Regional, in Perry Georgia this past January. There were so many kids from all over the US with so many breeds, showmanship styles and experience levels. I got to meet new friends and compete against some of the best showman in the industry.\n\nFavorite NJSA contest and why?\n\nMy favorite contest has to be showmanship. I love competing and showmanship allows me to show how much work I put in outside the ring, and encourages me to keep working harder.\n\nMost Memorable moment in the NJSA:\n\nTaking my first steps into the ring at my first NJSA show, I watched and heard about so many NJSA shows and couldn’t believe that I got to show at one like the Summer Spectacular. It was thrilling!\n\nWhat would you tell a younger member about NJSA?\n\nI would tell them to take the step, even if it's scary and you don’t think you'll be good enough to compete. The competition is tough, but if you work hard and put in the hours then you will succeed. Your success will not be measured by your winnings, buckles or banners, but by the relationships you will make along the way. The entire swine industry is a very humble organization to be a part of and you will learn so much and create many memories and friendships that'll last forever!\n\nAccomplishments:\n\nClass 7 winner\n\nClass 10 winner\n\nGrand Champion Market hog 2021 (Pasco County Fair)\n\nClass 1 winner\n\n3rd overall intermediate showmanship\n\n7th overall intermediate showmanship\n\nClass 9 winner\n\n3rd overall Market hog 2022 (Pasco County Fair)\n\nFavorite Quote:\n\n\"The comeback is always stronger than the set back.\"\n\nWhat do you want to be someday (career)?\n\nI haven't fully decided, but possibly attend nursing school at Southeastern University. I would love to work in the medical field, but I still plan to continue staying involved in agriculture in some form.\n\nFuture plans:\n\nI plan to dual enroll my junior year in high school and continue traveling and showing pigs with the NJSA and Florida Junior Swine Circuit until I graduate high school!\n\nAnything else you would like to know/include in your bio?\n\nI want to thank my Mom, Dad, Aunt and Uncle, and Cousin for all they have sacrificed for my brother and I to show pigs. None of it would be possibly without any of them. All the late nights, miles traveled, best times and everything in between. I'm beyond thankful to have each one of them who supports me in all I do. Thank you to every friend I've met, breeder who's provided me with pigs, and everyone who's given me the confidence to chase and never stop pursuing my dreams. It truly does take a village to show and raise livestock.\n\nName: Cale Williams Age: 16\n\nHometown: Cory, IN\n\nParents Names: A.J. & Kristi Williams\n\nSchool & Grade: Terre Haute South High School/10th\n\nSiblings Names & Ages: Blake (14) & Drew (11) Williams\n\nHobbies in school:\n\nI am a member of numerous clubs, heavily involved in FFA.

Where?\n\nI started showing pigs in various jackpot shows locally. Soon, I was showing at national shows, one being the 2009 National Junior Summer Spectacular.\n\nHow did you get started showing pigs?\n\nMy dad had raised pigs since he was a kid. He was the one who got me to enjoy showing pigs and helped me start my Bred-and-Owned Swine Program. This makes me a 3rd Generation Swine Farmer.\n\nWhy do you show pigs?\n\nI show pigs because I genuinely enjoy it. My dad got me into it and I immediately loved it. Ever since then, I have continued to show pigs.\n\nWhat do you enjoy most about showing pigs?\n\nThe most enjoyable thing about showing pigs are the life lessons I have learned along the way. The leadership, responsibility, and charisma that the swine industry has taught me is absolutely second to none.\n\nFavorite livestock shows and why:\n\nI enjoy showing at the Southeast Regional in Perry, GA because it is exciting to show in the middle of winter, something that would be difficult to do in Indiana.\n\nHow long have you been an NJSA member? 13 years\n\nHow did you get involved in the NJSA?\n\nOriginally, it was because my dad signed me up for it. However, through the amount of life lessons I have learned in this amazing program, I am truly humbled to have had the opportunity to be a member of it.\n\nNJSA shows and events you have participated in and years:\n\nNational Junior Swine Spectacular (2009, 2017-2019, 2021) Southeast Regional (2018-2022) Eastern Regional (2018-2020) Southwest Regional (2019-2021) National Junior Show (2020) Exposition (2021)\n\nFavorite NJSA event and why:\n\nMy favorite NJSA event is the Southeast Regional in Perry, GA because it is exciting to show pigs in the middle of winter, something that is not so easily accomplished in Indiana.\n\nFavorite NJSA contest and why:\n\nMy favorite NJSA contest is the Bred and Owned Program because it is exciting to display my own livestock, something that was completely my own effort.\n\nMost memorable moment in the NJSA:\n\nMy most memorable moment in the NJSA is not only celebrating my own success, but celebrating the success of others. Through this organization, I have learned how to be humble with my success while cheering on those around me.\n\nWhat would you tell a younger member about NJSA?\n\nI would tell a younger member to just enjoy what they are doing. Before too long, it will be over. So, you need to enjoy it now before these opportunities go away.\n\nAccomplishments within the NJSA:\n\nReserve Grand Champion Gilt (2019 Southwest Regional) Champion and Reserve Champion Yorkshire Gilts (2020 Southeast Regional) Reserve Champion Duroc Barrow (2019 Eastern Regional, 2020 Southwest Regional, and 2021 Southeast Regional)\n\nAccomplishments other than the NJSA:\n\nOutstanding First Year Swine Member, Junior Member, Intermediate Member, and Outstanding Jr. Leader of Clay Co. 4-H 2019 Indiana State Fair Intermediate Tamworth Barrow and Gilt Champion Showman 2017 Indiana State Fair Junior Landrace Gilt Showman\n\nFavorite quote:\n\n“Success is not final; failure is not fatal: it is the courage to continue that counts.”-Winston Churchill\n\nFuture Plans:\n\nI plan to attend Purdue University, majoring in Pharmacy while simultaneously receiving my Masters in Business Administration Degree to be in Hospital Administration. However, I plan to remain true to the agriculture industry by maintaining my family’s swine farm and hopefully getting my own kids involved someday.\n\nWhat do you want to be someday (career)?\n\nI want to be a pharmacist and one day become a hospital administrator.\n\nAnything else you would like us to know/include in your bio?\n\nBOILER UP!!\n\nThe NJSA would like to put Corbin Winkle under this month’s spotlight! Corbin is the 13-year-old son of Matt and Rachel Winkle, hailing from Hillsboro, Ohio. O-H, can someone say I-O?? The 4.0 GPA student himself is an 8th grader at Hillsboro Middle School. He is the older brother to Claire and Collin. Outside of the showring, Corbin enjoys being an FFA member, and participating in Cross Country and Wrestling.\n\nCorbin’s passion for showing pigs started on both sides of his pedigree as both his mother and father grew up showing and raising livestock. When Corbin was 6, his father bought him and his sister 3 barrows and the family exhibited them at the Highland County Fair Open show, hosted by the Pork Council. Being a proud member of the NJSA since 2016, Corbin’s favorite part about showing pigs is the competitive nature of the showpig industry and all the opportunities that you must meet new people from different parts of the country. He enjoys being able to travel to pig shows with his family. To the Winkle family, it is truly a family project. Whether it is in the barn or at the show, they do it together.\n\nAsking Corbin his favorite show led to a toss-up, as he really enjoys the feeling of the green shaving in Louisville, and the turf in Perry, but considering his pride for the Buckeye state, his favorite show will always be THE Ohio State Fair. Upon finishing his first year of 4-H, and year on the Ohio jackpot series, Corbin decided he wanted to join the NJSA. Him and his family had put together a set of pigs to take to Perry. They purchased a Yorkshire gilt from Thompson Brothers, and a Crossbred gilt from Al Schminke. At the show, Corbin placed in top 10 in showmanship and skillathon and could not wait to go back! Even in his 4 short years of being a member of the NJSA, Corbin has rung the bell in awards. Whether that be in the showmanship ring, gilt, or barrow show, judging contest, or even at the skillathon contest, Corbin is a force to be reckoned with.\n\nCorbin’s favorite NJSA event would have to be the NJSS/Summer Spectacular because of all the multiple events that he can participate in. Showing in the air conditioning in the middle of the summer is just a bonus as well! Within all the NJSA contest, Corbin’s favorite is the judging contest because he enjoys being able to talk difference with his parents. His most memorable moment in the NJSA was winning Reserve Champion Intermediate Showmanship Honors at the 2020 National Junior Show in Des Moines Iowa. Coming from an outsider, I would say Corbin’s already proven track record of 6 time top 10 sweepstakes finishes, 5 time top 10 skillathon wins and multiple times in the top 10 of showmanship, this kid will be very successful with the NJSA for years to come.\n\nWhen asked what advice he would give to younger members he states, “Try everything! I remember telling my dad that I wasn’t confident enough to memorize a speech and deliver it in front of judges. He told me that it sounds like a pretty good reason to try it. I worked on my speech for weeks and enjoyed it. I know it’s not always easy or comfortable to try new things, but that’s how you find out what you like and don’t like.” His favorite quote comes from the greatest book of all. “Let us run with endurance the race that is set before us. Hebrews 12:1.” Corbin’s future plans include to continue to show pigs and be more involved in the NJSA. He would like to mentor other young people who are interested in the show pig industry. Also, Corbin would also like to expand my Supervised Agricultural Experience in Swine and Crop Production and become more involved with the National FFA Organization. The NJSA would like to congratulate Corbin on all his accomplishments and wish him the best of luck in future endeavors.\n\nName: Ava Vallery\n\nAge: 13 years old\n\nHometown: South Solon, OH\n\nParents Names: Dave and Angi Vallery, Ali and Scott Vanzant.\n\nSchool & Grade:\n\nGlobal Impact STEM Academy, 8th Grade\n\nSiblings Names & Ages:\n\nKayla (22)\n\nHobbies in school:\n\nFFA Activities,\n\nHobbies out of school:\n\nLivestock Judging, Hanging out with friends, Traveling,\n\nHow long have you been showing pigs?\n\nGoing on 9 years.\n\nWhen did you start showing pigs?

Where?\n\nI started showing at my local county fair (Pasco County Fair) at the age of eight.\n\nHow did you get started showing pigs?\n\nMy sister was already showing at our county fair and I loved being involved with her projects. As soon as I was old enough I started to show.\n\nWhy do you show pigs?\n\nWhen I first started to show I always wanted to win the buckles and banners but I figured out there is so much more to showing. It is about the lessons you learn, the priceless memories you make and the lifelong friendships you create along the way. The biggest thing raising and showing pigs has taught me is you have to be a humble winner, a graceful loser and every loss comes with a lesson learned.\n\nWhat do you enjoy most about showing pigs?\n\nFavorite livestock shows and why: I enjoy showing at the Florida State Fair. I love the atmosphere and that my friends from all over the state can show together. Participating in the Florida Junior Swine Circuit has also introduced me to show families that I can’t imagine showing pigs without. And of course the Pasco County Fair because it is my hometown fair!!\n\nHow long have you been an NJSA member?\n\nThis is my fourth year as a NJSA member\n\nHow did you get involved in the NJSA?\n\nI was able to go to some jackpot shows with Mason LaMonte and I loved it!!
