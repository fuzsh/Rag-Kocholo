        "text": "A winner at every stage of his career, Eliah Drinkwitz – considered one of college football's top offensive minds – was introduced as the University of Missouri's 33rd football head coach in December 2019. The 2024 campaign is his fifth running the program and sixth season as a head coach\n\nIn his eight seasons as an offensive coordinator and head coach, Drinkwitz, the 2023 Southeastern Conference Coach of the Year, has produced seven 1,000-yard rushers, five 3,000-yard passers and five 1,000-yard receivers. In three years (2015, 2017, 2018), his offenses made at least one in each category. The 2023 Mizzou team featured all three in QB Brady Cook, WR Luther Burden III and RB Cody Schrader, who led the SEC in rushing.\n\nDrinkwitz – 28-21 at MU (four seasons) and 40-22 overall as a head coach (five seasons) – advanced to bowl games in his first four seasons with the Tigers, joining former head coach Warren Powers (1978, 1979, 1980, 1981) as the only two MU head coaches to achieve the feat.\n\nUnder Drinkwitz's leadership, Mizzou produced its highest-ranked recruiting classes: 2021 No. 20, 2022 No. 15 (per 247), the No. 1 wide receiver in the 2022 class (Burden), the nation’s top player in the 2024 class (Nwaneri) and three straight Top 25 ranked classes.\n\nThe 2023 Tigers put together an 11-2 season that saw MU move into the Top 10 of all three national polls. The double-digit wins campaign was the first since 2014. Mizzou went 6-2 in SEC games, won both the Mayor's Cup over South Carolina and Battle Line Rivalry over Arkansas and qualified for its first New Year's Six bowl and defeated Ohio State in the Goodyear Cotton Bowl.\n\nThe 2022 season showcased a much-improved defense, ranked fourth in the Southeastern Conference and 34th nationally by allowing just 340.8 yards per game, 93.8 less than in 2021. Freshman phenom Burden exploded on the scene, becoming the first true freshman since 2008 to record two receiving touchdowns, two rushing touchdowns, and a punt-return touchdown in the same season.\n\nThe 2021 season saw Tyler Badie set the school's single-season record for rushing yards (1,604). His 14 touchdowns in 12 games are ninth on Mizzou's single-season and top-10 list. He was a CoSIDA Academic All-American, the SEC Football Scholar-Athlete of the Year (Mizzou's first-ever), first-team All-SEC and was named to multiple All-America teams.\n\nIn 2020, the Tigers overcame an 0-2 start to win five of their last eight games despite playing with less than 60 scholarship players for over half of those contents. Of the SEC's four new head coaches to begin work in the nation's toughest conference in 2020, Drinkwitz's 5-5 regular-season record was the league's best, ahead of Ole Miss' Lane Kiffin (4-5), Mississippi State's Mike Leach (3-7) and Arkansas' Sam Pittman (3-7).\n\nDrinkwitz took over the Tigers program following an impressive 2019 season at Appalachian State that saw the 20th-ranked Mountaineers win the Sun Belt Conference title en route to a 12-1 record. Drinkwitz was named a finalist for the 2019 Eddie Robinson Award, a prestigious annual award to the nation's top coach. He was also named the North Carolina Coach of the Year by the North State Journal.\n\nBefore App State, Drinkwitz spent three years as offensive coordinator and quarterbacks coach at NC State (2016-18), two years at Boise State - coaching the tight ends (2014) and serving as offensive coordinator and quarterbacks coach (2015) - along with two years as the running backs coach at Arkansas State where the Red Wolves won back-to-back Sun Belt Championships. His first FBS coaching opportunity was as a quality control assistant at Auburn from 2010-11. The Tigers won the SEC and went on to the BCS Championship with a 14-0 record.\n\nDrinkwitz graduated magna cum laude and was the student body president at Arkansas Tech (bachelor's, education) before beginning his coaching career at the prep level in his hometown of Alma, Ark., in 2005. He and his wife, Lindsey (Sivils), have four daughters: Addison, Emerson, Ella and Parker Lynn.\n\nExperience\n\n2005: Alma (Ark.) HS (Assistant)\n\n2006-09: Springdale (Ark.)
