        "text": "Golden State Warriors superstar Stephen Curry did not have the best of games for Team USA on Monday. The former back-to-back MVP remained in the starting line-up but ended up scoring just three points on 1-of-6 shooting from beyond the arc.\n\nCurry’s struggles from the field contributed to Team USA’s too-close-for-comfort win against Australia. After leading by as many as 24 points in the third quarter, the Americans nearly let their opponents steal this game away. In the end, they held on for the win, 98-92.\n\nGolden State Warriors News: Stephen Curry’s Reaction to Team USA Win\n\nWhat looked like an easy blowout suddenly turned into a real dogfight in the end. Curry knows that this could have been a catastrophic result for his team and their aspirations for a gold medal in the upcoming Olympic Games. Nevertheless, the Warriors superstar is just happy to come home with a W.\n\n“We got a lot to clean up but that was good vibes today,” he said.\n\nCurry clearly isn’t fazed by the fact that he scored just three points in the game. Despite the abundance of superstars on the squad, there are just no competing egos on this team. These players are locked in on a solitary goal, and even Curry, who is widely considered one of the leaders of the group, is more than willing to step back for the good of the team.\n\nAt the end of the day, the gold medal is what matters the most.\n\nFor More NBA Content:"
