        "text": "The play by play\n\nThe Golden State Warriors are one of the most celebrated basketball teams — both on and off the court. Considering their back-to-back NBA championships, it’s easy to see why they have one of the strongest fan bases in the NBA.\n\nHow could they give fans the greatest experience in their new home, and go from a basketball team to a media and entertainment powerhouse? By leveraging new technologies and partnerships to transform the core of the Warrior’s business.\n\nAccenture designed the Warriors & Chase Center mobile app around the fan experience using a cloud-based, decoupled architecture. This allows third-party features, like mobile pay and navigation, to be plugged in like Lego blocks in real time without sending a wave of disruption throughout the system.\n\nThe result? A future system that is boundaryless, using innovation from across the ecosystem, for a more engaging fan experience.\n\nThe Warriors and Accenture are making a positive impact on the community by encouraging education. Accenture also sits on the board for Generation Thrive, the Golden State Warriors foundation. One example is our engagement with Math Hoops, a fast-paced board game and mobile app, they’re teaching students fundamental math skills using basketball statistics on their favorite NBA and WNBA players.\n\nThe Warriors were the first team to get involved with Math Hoops. Now, almost half of the NBA teams participate."
