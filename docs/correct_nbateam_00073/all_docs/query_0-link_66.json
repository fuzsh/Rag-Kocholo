        "text": "The Golden State Warriors are navigating a new chapter in the franchise’s history following the departure of Klay Thompson, who signed with the Dallas Mavericks this past offseason after 13 years with the team. While Thompson’s exit marks the end of the Splash Brothers era, it also underscores the reality of an ever-changing NBA landscape.\n\nVery rarely do players get the storybook ending of playing for one team their entire career. Warriors superstar Stephen Curry even acknowledged this during a recent interview with Yahoo Sports.\n\nPer Yahoo Sports:\n\n“I mean, I can clearly say I want to be a Warrior for life,” Curry told Yahoo Sports in an interview Sunday afternoon in Las Vegas."
