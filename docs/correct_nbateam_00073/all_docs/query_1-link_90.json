        "text": "Ok, it’s been almost a month since free agency opened and I’m checking in on all 30 teams and the moves made since the official July 1st free agency start date. For the purposes of the piece, drafted players were not included as transactions/signings. My focus was to look at each team’s offseason as both a response to the results of last year as well as how it informs the aspirations and expectations of next season. Short of published articles, with zero inside access to these teams, I can only put myself in the head of a decision maker and make my assessments based on what I believe each team’s strategy to be. If I say something about your favorite team that upsets you, a) you’re probably upset because you’ve been thinking it too, but b) know my primary bias is my love for good basketball and smart roster construction. Let’s get into these deals shall we…\n\nAtlanta Hawks\n\nWhat Success Looks Like: Deciding what a roster built around Trae Young and Dejounte Murray looks like.\n\nSignings/Trades: Dejounte Murray (signed veterans-extension 4-year, $114.07 million), Patty Mills (via trade: sent Rudy Gay, TyTy Washington, Usman Garuba and future 2nd-round pick to Oklahoma City), Wesley Matthews (UFA signed 1-year, $3.2 million), Mouhamed Gueye (signed 4-year, $7.64 million non-guaranteed)\n\nInitial Reaction: The Hawks have the potential to be so many things. Next season they can be a top five seed in the postseason just as easily as they could miss the playoffs all together. Having traded a considerable amount last season to land Dejounte Murray, getting his extension done was a must. Now the question is how far can a Young and Murray backcourt go and further more, can the Hawks find the right role players to support a team built around two smaller guards? Outside of Clint Capela, there isn’t a lot of size on this roster, to the point where I’m pretty sure I remember lineups with Bogdan Bogdanovic manning the four spot. I’m all for small-ball, but I’d prefer my team use it as a strategy if useful and not out of a necessary desperation because hey, it’s all they got.\n\nRole players aside, the whole Hawks franchise is currently resting on the shoulders of Trae Young. Atlanta’s success depends on Young’s ability to transcend what could be years of mediocre rosters because, they are still the Hawks after all. Speaking of which, despite extending him for the max amount possible the moment he was eligible, Young trade rumors resurface seemingly every time the team goes on a losing streak. With Murray now locked in long-term, could we arrive at a point where the Hawks decide Young and his 5-year, $215 million contract is not worth the return on investment? Despite his top-10 usage rate, Young finished 45th for win shares last season. It’s fair to question if given his size whether playing like Steph Curry without being as good as Steph Curry is sustainable .\n\nBoston Celtics\n\nWhat Success Looks Like: Finding a damn point guard! Also adding shooting to a roster and offense that is overly reliant on the three-ball but has few reliable shooters.\n\nSignings/Trades: Kristaps Porzingis (via trade: sent out Marcus Smart, Danilo Gallinari, Mike Muscala and a 2023 2nd round pick in three team trade with Memphis and Washington), Oshae Brissett (UFA signed 2-year, $4.6 million), Dalano Banton (UFA signed 2-year, $4.2 million), J.D. Davidson (signed two-way contract)\n\nInitial Reaction: Let me perhaps be the first to point out that Kristaps Porzingis will be the Celtics highest paid player next season which means both he and soon to be supermax-extension eligible Jaylen Brown will be paid more than Jayson Tatum until at least 2025. That won’t be awkward at all, right? Anyway, I’m not a huge fan of what Boston has done this summer. They traded the closest thing they had to a point guard for a player who struggles to stay on the court and is all too happy being seven-feet tall, playing 30 feet away from the basket and bombing away from three. Marcus Smart was far from the ideal decision-maker at the point, but he was the best option Boston had. To trade Smart in part because their original offer for Malcom Brogdon fell through after a failed physical seemed like a panic move. It feels even more like a panic move now as Boston failed to at least use a veteran’s minimum to bring in a quality emergency option like Derrick Rose (signed to Memphis) or Patrick Beverly (singed to Philly) to play quality minutes during key stretches of both the regular and post-seasons.\n\nPorzingis is coming off a career year as his team’s best player and the Wizards were hardly a threat to anyone. Obviously he will be asked to carry a lighter load in Boston, but then the question becomes does it make sense to pay your third option $30 million plus a year? The only way this Porzingis move makes sense to me is if Boston knows they are eventually going to lose Jaylen Brown and expect Porzingis to fill that void in scoring. For now, a Derrick White, Brown, Tatum, Porzingis, and Robert Williams, starting five is one of the most talented lineups in all of basketball. Should this team regress from their successes of the past few seasons however, we’ll know there was some truth to Marcus Smart being the heart of this Celtics team. Either that or asking natural shooting guards like Malcom Brogdon and Derrick White to be point guards isn’t a good idea.\n\nTransaction Update: Jaylen Brown signed 5-year, $304 million max-extension\n\nBrooklyn Nets\n\nWhat Success Looks Like: Extending Cameron Johnson at an amount that can be easily packaged and traded if/when the time comes. Also bringing in a forward or center to help Nicolas Claxton, Dorian Finney-Smith, and a roster devoid of size.\n\nSignings/Trades: Cameron Johnson (RFA re-signed 4-year, $108 million), Dennis Smith Jr (UFA signed 1-year, $2.5 million), Lonnie Walker IV (UFA singed 1-year, $2.3 million), Darius Bazley (UFA signed 1-year, $2.1 million)\n\nInitial Reaction: He’s clearly a part of their core for now but the Johnson contract is more than I thought he’d get. Johnson is a lethal shooter, has improved his overall game, and was a great part of the return package back to Brooklyn in the Kevin Durant trade. That said, it’s clearly a player-friendly market this summer and we don’t even have the new CBA to blame yet. The free agent class this summer just isn’t that deep and teams with cap space are going to have to decide which players are worth splurging on now in the hopes that in several seasons, those deals will be below the new market value and easy to move.\n\nI like brining in Smith Jr. as a third or even backup point guard option to Dinwiddie, because who knows what shenanigans Ben Simmons will pull to avoid playing this year. The only other thing I’d like to see from Brooklyn before the summer ends is signing some size to help with rebounding and rim protection. Names like Bismack Biyombo, Udoka Azubuike, or a grizzled vet like Taj Gibson, aren’t starting options but can add depth and veteran mentorship to a young team that struggles to rebound and defend inside.\n\nCharlotte Hornets\n\nWhat Success Looks Like: Deciding if they still want to employ Miles Bridges and finding some help on the inside for a roster littered with guards and small forwards.\n\nSignings/Trades: LaMelo Ball (signed designated rookie-extension 5-year, $205.9 million), Miles Bridges (RFA signed 1-year, $7.9 million qualifying-offer)\n\nInitial Reactions: Getting the Lonzo Ball extension done was a no-brainer but still job well done there by Charlotte. Bringing back Miles Bridges might have been a complicated decision for off the court reasons, but on the court, he will help this team in desperate need of scoring. As far as remaining moves, I assume they plan to re-sign PJ Washington though I’m not sure what they’re waiting for. As far as other available big men go, Christian Wood is still available and would be a meaningful addition for this team but at this point, it doesn’t seem like they plan on signing anyone else, at least until the team is officially under new ownership.\n\nTransaction Update: Michael Jordan’s sale of the team officially approved by the league.\n\nChicago Bulls\n\nWhat Success Looks Like: Avoid signing players 28 and older to long-term deals unless part of a sign-and-trade. Speaking of trades, if Chicago can get some draft capital or young players in return for either or both DeMar DeRozan and Nikola Vucevic, they should have done that at least a season ago.\n\nSignings/Trades: Nikola Vucevic (veteran’s-extension signed 3-year, $60 million), Colby White (RFA re-signed 3-year, $33 million), Jevon Carter (UFA signed 3-year, $20 million), Tory Craig (UFA signed 2-year, $5.3 million), Andre Drummond (player-option signed 1-year, $3.3 million),\n\nInitial Reaction: Chicago is still paying contender money for a team that can barely make the play-in slot. The Vucevic contract is reasonable for his services it’s just the Bulls are so many pieces away from being a serious team that it feels foolish to pay a 32-year-old in-explosive center $20 million plus a year through 2026. I suppose Chicago could make the case at $20 million a year annually it remains a trade-able contract, but I would counter with if they were going to trade Vucevic, they should have done so anytime between last offseason and the 2023 trade deadline. The list of teams that both makes sense and could afford to trade for Vucevic gets shorter every day.\n\nOn the plus side, I do like what the Bulls did locking up Colby White at around $11 million annually as well as bringing in Jevon Carter, further signaling Chicago is prepared to take the “L” on their Lonzo Ball investment. The next step for Chicago; free up the minutes in their guard/wing rotation by finding a trade partner for DeMar DeRozan. Finding a DeRozan trade partner isn’t easy but maybe teams who have been rebuilding for a few seasons and are right on the verge of breaking through could unload some assets without giving up the farm for a proven one-on-one scorer in DeRozan. Teams that come to mind are Orlando, Utah, or maybe Sacramento.\n\nTransaction Update: Ayo Dosunmu (RFA signed 3-year, $21 million)\n\nCleveland Cavaliers\n\nWhat Success Looks Like: Bringing in some size on the perimeter and adding shooting. Also, Jarrett Allen serves a very similar function to Evan Mobley. Since one is a future budling block of the franchise and the other is Jarrett Allen, trading Allen this offseason could be worth exploring.\n\nSignings/Trades: Max Strus (UFA signed 4-year, $63 million), Caris LeVert (UFA re-signed 2-year, $32 million), Georges Niang (UFA signed 3-year, $26 million), Ty Jerome (RFA signed 2-year, $4.6 million)\n\nInitial Reaction: So far, Cleveland has had the most success this summer with signing players at positions of need to reasonable deals. They need shooting, so they add Strus and Niang. They need size at the guard position to help offset the diminutive nature of their Donovan Mitchell and Darius Garland backcourt, so they re-sign Caris LeVert. LeVert along with Strus give the Cavs an extra body to throw at bigger wings in the East like Jaylen Brown, Jason Tatum, or Jimmy Butler come playoff time.\n\nWhile I am an advocate of exploring a Jarrett Allen trade, I realize his shot blocking/altering on defense and rim running on offense is valuable and that he’s unlikely to be moved unless the Cavs are blown away by an offer. With just the tiniest bit of cap maneuverability left and essentially a full roster, should the Cavs target a second or third-string wing defender, players like Derrick Jones Jr, or T.J. Warren are still out there.\n\nDallas Mavericks\n\nWhat Success Looks Like: Success in Dallas is very simple; surround generational talent, Luka Doncic, with as many complimentary players as possible.\n\nSignings/Trades: Kyrie Irving (UFA signed 3-year, $126 million), Grant Williams (via sign-and-trade: sent out Reggie Bullock and 2030 pick swap in three team trade with Boston and San Antonio), Dwight Powell (UFA signed 3-year, $12 million), Seth Curry (UFA signed 2-year, $9.25 million), Dante Exum (FA signed 1-year, $2.7 million)\n\nInitial Reaction: After trading away assets to get him, if Mark Cuban and the Mavs had failed to keep Kyrie, I’m not sure what plan B would have been. Though Dallas had no choice but to re-sign Kyrie, there are worse situations to be forced into than having to re-sign the most talented free agent in this year’s class. The Luka-Irving backcourt can absolutely work but only if the rest of the roster is constructed to mask both player’s inefficiencies, specifically on the defensive end.\n\nCurrently this Mavericks roster is constructed to score a lot of points but stop absolutely no one, which was their biggest problem last year. Tim Hardaway Jr., Maxi Kleber, Josh Green, and Seth Curry can help make this team a top-five offense but outside of Dwight Powell and the newly acquired Grant Williams, there isn’t a soul on this roster who defends at an above average level. To rejoin the ranks of the Western Conference postseason teams, I’d like to see Dallas use their non-taxpayer mid-level exception to sign someone who can make an impact as a versatile defender.\n\nDenver Nuggets\n\nWhat Success Looks Like: Resisting the emotional desire to bring everyone back after a championship season. Running it back is fine but running it back doesn’t mean bring everyone back no matter the cost.\n\nSignings/Trades: Reggie Jackson (UFA signed 2-year, $10.25 million), DeAndre Jordan (UFA signed 1-year, $3.19 million), Justin Holiday (UFA signed 1-year, $3.19 million)\n\nInitial Reaction: The only decision Denver really had to make this offseason was how much they were willing to spend to retain the services of Bruce Brown. Once it was clear his price tag would far exceed anything the Nuggets could realistically offer, Denver shifted their focus to bringing back Reggie Jackson as a backup or third point guard option and DeAndre Jordan for depth and size if they need a body. With virtually no cap room to work with, free agency was always going to be a quiet period for the Nuggets. When over 70% of your team’s cap is owed to the core of Nikola Jokic, Jamal Murray, Michael Porter Jr., and Aaron Gordon, filling out the rest of the roster is almost exclusively a draft day task.\n\nThe next big financial decision for this Nuggets front office will be getting a Jamal Murray extension done. No one will be more motivated to make an All-NBA team these next two seasons than Murray. He stands to make anywhere between 25–30% more on his next extension with Denver if he is named to one of the three All-NBA teams. The West alone is loaded with guards so to get supermax designation, Murray needs to beat out Steph Curry, SGA, Ja Morant, De’Aaron Fox, Devin Booker, and Anthony Edwards for one of six guard slots. And those are just the names in the West. Donovan Mitchell, Jaylen Brunson, Trae Young, Tyrese Haliburton, and wherever Dame Lillard ends up will all be vying for spots as well, and again, there’s only room for six. They’d never admit this but Denver ownership could be routing against their star guard being named to an All-NBA team in the name of million dollar savings.\n\nDetroit Pistons\n\nWhat Success Looks Like: Continue showing patience in the growth of this young core and using their cap space this summer to improve around the margins.\n\nSignings/Trades: Joe Harris (via trade: sent cash considerations to Brooklyn), Alec Burks (exercised team-option 1-year, $10.4 million), Monte Morris (via trade: sent out 2nd round pick to Washington), Isiah Livers (exercised team-option 1-year, $1.83 million) Jared Rhoden (signed two-way contract)\n\nInitial Reaction: Adding Joe Harris, Monte Morris, and a couple second round picks almost doesn’t meet the requirement of marginal improvements. Using coach Monty Williams contract negotiations as a point of information, it appears the only way the Pistons can land the better free agents is by offering them way more money than any other team. I imagine the Pistons were interested in players seeking the bag like Bruce Brown or Dillion Brooks as well as players like Georges Niang or Trey Lyles who ended up taking smaller deals to join playoff contenders. I understand not being viewed as a playoff team, so that means either the Pistons were more conservative with their offers than some other smaller market teams or players would rather take the same or even less money to play elsewhere, which is a damning statement.\n\nAdding insult to injury, losing out on a top three lotto pick this summer might have capped the ceiling on a roster that already includes several young promising pieces. Headed into next season, Detroit has seven players on rookie-scale contracts. The toughest decision during this rebuild is coming soon as the Pistons must decide who will get long-term extensions and ultimately which players to move to the trade block. With essentially two rookie-contracts at every position, this roster will spend the next few seasons under a microscope being evaluated not just week-to-week but projecting what they can be the next four or five years.\n\nGolden State Warriors\n\nWhat Success Looks Like: Getting a Draymond Green deal done. Also, since this team is going all in on old guys, to counteract that, they need to find a way to add some younger quicker perimeter players.\n\nSignings/Trades: Chris Paul (via trade: sent out Jordan Poole, Ryan Rollins, Patrick Baldwin Jr. a 1st and 2nd round pick to Washington), Draymond Green (UFA signed 4-year, $100 million), Cory Joseph (UFA signed 1-year, $3.19 million)\n\nInitial Reaction: I’m not sure I follow the logic of new GM, Mike Dunleavy Jr.’s, first few moves. I understand wanting to move off the Jordan Poole contract that was signed under the Bob Myers regime if it wasn’t something Dunleavy agreed with. I am shocked though if the best offer the Warriors got involved them having to staple a future 1st-round draft pick to Poole’s contract just to receive a soon to be 39-year-old backup point guard in return.\n\nChris Paul is clearly on the final leg of his career and is best fit for a sixth-man role on this Warriors team. I don’t know if Paul is willing to accept a bench role and seemingly the Warriors don’t intend to find out since they are valuing him like a starter. I don’t know if they are ready to bring Thompson off the bench nor can they afford to make Wiggins a sixth man. A Paul, Curry, Thompson, Green, Looney lineup is going to struggle to match up with a lot of teams defensively meanwhile a Paul, Curry, Wiggins, Green, Looney lineup may struggle to produce enough offense. If the Warriors still intend to play for a championship, they should compare their roster with the rest of the contenders out West. How would that potential starting lineup matchup against the Nuggets, Suns, Lakers or even Clippers? While the rest of the league is getting younger and longer at every position, the Warriors are going the other way. Last season they struggled to rebound and defend the rim, and so far this offseason, they have done nothing to address those areas of need.\n\n*Transaction Update: Dario Saric (UFA signed 1-year, $2.7 million)\n\nHouston Rockets\n\nWhat Success Looks Like: Using their cap space to bring in quality veteran starters and rotational players that mesh well with their young nucleus. Specifically, they need defensive forwards and more perimeter shooting.\n\nSignings/Trades: Fred VanVleet (UFA signed 3-year, $128 million), Dillion Brooks (UFA signed 4-year, $80 million), Jock Landale (UFA signed 4-year, $32 million), Jeff Green (UFA signed 1-year, $6 million), Alpha Kaba (via trade: sent out TyTy Washington, Usman Garuba, two future 2nd-round picks and cash considerations to Atlanta), Darius Day (signed two-way contract), Trevor Hudgins (signed two-way contract),\n\nInitial Reaction: Houston has been busy this free agency period. Rather than have the “did they overpay for [insert name here]” conversation, I want to first focus on the fact that Houston is inevitably starting next season with a better roster than the one that started the 2022–23 season. A potential starting five of Fred VanVleet, Jalen Green, Dillion Brooks, Jabari Smith Jr, and Alperen Sengun is good enough to avoid being dead last in the West and maybe even contend for the final play-in spot (or am I getting too carried away). The Rockets need a steady hand at the point guard spot as I would argue both Jalen Green and Kevin Porter Jr are shooting guards at heart, and both are way too turnover prone. VanVleet should certainly help with that though his arrival may signal the clock is ticking for Kevin Porter Jr’s time as a Rocket. Houston also needs help defensively on the wing and if nothing else, Dillion Brooks can give them that. Jock Landale gives them size depth and can help on the boards and as a scorer down low while Jeff Green, in addition to being a great locker room presence, adds a shooting-forward to a team in desperate need of reliable shooting.\n\nNow from a financial standpoint, might the Rockets have misread the market on Fred VanVleet? Well considering Kyrie Irving signed a 3-year, $126 million dollar deal with the Mavericks, VanVleet making roughly the same thing annually seems like it might have been a bit of an overpay by Houston (or pretty good value for the Mavs depending how you look at it). $20 million a year for Dillion Brooks is likely more than other teams rumored to be interested in him were willing to offer but Houston had the money to spend. I won’t be overly critical of them for spending 14% of their team salary on a player who can get 15–18 points a night, plays above average defense and whose minutes on a nightly basis shouldn’t interfere with the development of their young core. Overall, the Rockets have added some quality players without disrupting the growth of their young core and without financially hamstringing themselves down the road. Either VanVleet, and Brooks will help Houston start to turn things around under new coach, Ime Doka, or two years from now, both players could easily be packaged and moved if Houston once again finds themselves as sellers next trade deadline.\n\n*Transaction Update: Aaron Holiday (UFA signed 1-year, $2.3 million)\n\nIndiana Pacers\n\nWhat Success Looks Like: Doing whatever it takes to make Tyrese Halliburton happy. Also, figuring out If Myles Turner is a part of their future because he’s an unrestricted free agent come summer 2025.\n\nSignings/Trades: Tyrese Haliburton (signed designated rookie-extension 5-year, $205.9 million), (Bruce Brown (UFA signed 2-year, $45 million w/ 24–25 club option), Obi Toppin (via trade: sent out two 2nd-round picks to New York), Isiah Wong (signed two-way contract)\n\nInitial Reaction: Priority number one was getting Tyrese Halliburton extended so mission accomplished on that front. As for their lone free agent signing, with a championship ring already in the jewelry box, Bruce Brown clearly wanted the bag. He also smartly signed a shorter deal that will either guarantee him $23 million in 2024 or allows him to hit the open market again should the Pacers decline his second-year option (which is highly unlikely). From Indiana’s standpoint, Brown should help them make a push for a playoff spot and is a very efficient way for them to reach the salary floor this summer. In trading for Obi Toppin, Indiana added some much needed bounce and athleticism to a roster with a lot of players whose games I would label as “ground bound.” His energy and ability to produce offense without the ball in his hands will be welcomed and easy to integrate into any style of offense.\n\nThe focus for Indiana now becomes deciding whether Myles Turner is a part of the future going forward and if not, can they find a trade offer that makes sense for them. As I mentioned, the priority is making Haliburton happy so if he enjoys playing with Turner or if a Turner trade will ultimately makes the team worse, it’s not something I’d advise the Pacers do. However, should Indiana decide to move on from Turner, which team says no to this hypothetical sign-and-trade idea; Pacers send Myles Turner, Isiah Jackson, and two draft picks to Brooklyn in exchange for Ben Simmons. Brooklyn would get a stronger defensive presence at the center position who can also shoot. The Pacers could pray that playing in Indiana is obscure enough to convince Simmons no one is watching the games, stick him at power forward, and use him as the pick setting decision maker similar to the Draymond Green role in Golden State. It’s probably a fantasy but the reality is unless Turner and the Pacers make a deep postseason run over these next two seasons, letting him leave for nothing would be short-short sighted and wastes the final year of Haliburton’s rookie-scale deal.\n\nLos Angeles Clippers\n\nWhat Success Looks Like: Finding players who can eat up regular season minutes so that Kawhi Leonard and Paul George can do what they need to be healthy come playoff time. With virtually zero cap space, I’m not sure how they can do this without making a trade.\n\nSignings/Trades: Russell Westbrook (UFA signed 2-year, $7.8 million), Mason Plumlee (UFA signed 1-year, $5 million), Kenyon Martin Jr (via trade: sent out two future 2nd-round picks to Houston)\n\nInitial Reaction: There isn’t much to say for the Clippers free agency period to this point. With virtually no cap space, they were able to bring back two of their rotational players in Westbrook and Plumlee plus adding Keyon Martin Jr for a couple second-round draft picks was a steal. Martin Jr. is an unrestricted free agent in 2024 so it’s a small gamble on the Clippers part, but if he’s someone they like beyond this season, they should get first crack at negotiating a long-term deal. I don’t know how many minutes he’ll get next season but with Nicolas Batum, Robert Covington, and Marcus Morris all set to hit free agency next summer, Martin Jr could be a good replacement at that three or four spot moving forward.\n\nThis Clippers team has no excuse next season to not reach at least the WCF. They’re a top five roster on paper, but the paper champs aren’t scaring the Nuggets, Suns, Lakers, or even the dying dynasty that is the Warriors until they prove it in the postseason. Next year is probably a blueprint year for this Clippers team meaning if they don’t at least make it to the doorstep of The Finals, it’s likely the duo of Leonard and George will be broken up.\n\nLos Angeles Lakers\n\nWhat Success Looks Like: Bringing in a third player to further carry the offensive load for an aging LeBron and the often-injured Anthony Davis (though props to him for getting through this last postseason injury free). Also don’t bid against themselves for Austin Reeves as the market isn’t as hot as I’m sure they think it is.\n\nSignings/Trades: Austin Reaves (RFA signed 4-year, $56 million), Rai Hachimura (RFA signed 3-year, $51 million), D’Angelo Russell (UFA signed 2-year, $37 million), Gabe Vincent (UFA signed3-year, $33 million), Cam Reddish (UFA signed 2-year, $4.6 million), Jaxson Hayes (UFA signed 2-year, $4.6 million), Taurean Prince (UFA signed 1-year, $4.5 million), Colin Castleton (singed two-way contract), D’Moi Hodge (singed two-way contract)\n\nInitial Reaction: The Lakers did a good job allocating their cap space and filling out a roster that already has two All-Stars ready to carry an offensive load for 100 plus games next season. The problem is asking year-21-LeBron to carry this team offensively isn’t realistic. That means Anthony Davis will need to play like a league MVP for more than just 20 game stretches at a time and assume the mantle as the team’s leading scorer and best player. LeBron averaged 28 points, 8 boards and 6 assist last season but the more important number is 27, the number of games he missed. Expecting James to keep defying history makes no sense. As much as I like a lot of the deals the Lakers signed this summer (way to not go too crazy on the Reaves contract), I’d like them a lot more if I thought the Lakers were closer to winning a title than they are to having to consider what the post-LeBron era looks like.\n\nCredit to the Lakers for committing to winning right now and surrounding LeBron with one of the better supporting casts he’s had in some time. My concern is if LeBron really wants to win another title, he’s more likely to do so as a team’s third option and none of the free agents the Lakers signed allows him to do that. I wonder if we will look back at the end of next season and wonder if Los Angeles should have used some of the $62 million in next year’s committed salaries on Kyrie Irving or if that’s something they even considered? Maybe it was never on the table, but Irving was the only available free agent this summer who could step in and immediately allow LeBron to take a back seat offensively and conserve his energy for the homestretch. The past few seasons, LeBron has had to expend so much energy just to keep the Lakers in the playoff chase that by the time the postseason starts, he’s physically worn down. This roster should be good enough to stay above the 8th seed but if either James or Davis misses extensive time, D’Angelo Russell, Austin Reaves, or Rai Hachimura being the main threats on offense should have purple and gold nation a tad concerned.\n\nMemphis Grizzlies\n\nWhat Success Looks Like: Replacing the Dillion Brooks minutes, preferably with an improved shooter. Also finding a backup point guard, especially after the Tyus Jones trade and Morant suspension.\n\nSignings/Trades: Desmond Bane (max rookie-extension signed 5-year, $205.9 million), Marcus Smart (via trade: sent out 1st-round pick, Tyus Jones, and Marcus Sasser in three-team trade with Boston and Washington), Derrick Rose (UFA signed 2-year, $6.55 million), Josh Christopher (via sign-and-trade for Dillion Brooks to Houston)\n\nInitial Reaction: The Desmond Bane money is initially eye-popping but if that’s what the max rookie extension is, there’s not much to argue about and Memphis did what they had to do. Now it’s on Bane to play like a real number two option on a title-contending team and fortify his role as Memphis’ second-best offensive weapon. The Marcus Smart deal fell to them in a way they hadn’t planned on but he’s someone who can take over the lead guard role in Morant’s absence as well as do some of the things Dillion Brooks did for them defensively.\n\nFinally, the Derrick Rose pickup is a good option for an emergency point guard and should be a good veteran presence in a locker room filled exclusively with young people (and Steven Adams). Rose barely played for the Knicks last season so he might have a season or two of quality basketball left in him. Even if he does, that doesn’t help address Memphis’ most glaring need; an infusion of outside shooting. Luke Kennard was supposed to provide that, and he’s been a disappointment thus far. With Bane as their only reliable shooter, the Grizzlies are either banking on a career shooting year from Marcus Smart or are zigging while the league zags and don’t plan on utilizing the three-point shot as a part of their offensive attack.\n\nMiami Heat\n\nWhat Success Looks Like: Trading for Damian Lillard\n\nSignings/Trades: Kevin Love (UFA signed 2-years, $7.6 million), Josh Richardson (UFA signed 2-year, $5.9 million), Thomas Bryant (UFA 2 signed, 2-year, $5.3 million), Orlando Robinson (UFA singed 1-year, $1.8 million), Dru Smith (signed two-way contract)\n\nInitial Reaction: At this point if we were handing out grades, the Miami Heat would receive an “incomplete” because to this point they have not executed a trade for Damian Lillard. The Miami marching orders this offseason became clear the day Lillard announced he would be open to a trade and that the Heat was his prefered destination. It should be noted Lillard does not have a no-trade clause so he can say where he wants to play all he wants but the Blazers are not required to listen and should be looking for the best deal available. So far, the offers we have heard out of Miami are not the best Portland can do. I don’t care how much leverage Miami thinks it has, a package of Tyler Hero, one of either Kyle Lowry or Duncan Robinson and only two 1st-round draft picks should not be enough to land Lillard. For perspective, when the Cavilers traded for Donovan Mitchell last offseason, it cost them an eventual All-Star in Lauri Markkanen, a young player with some promise in Colin Sexton and five 1st-round draft picks. I understand Mitchell is younger and more of a future investment for Cleveland but at 33-years-old, Lillard is still one of the 10 best players in the league and should not be moved for a discount.\n\nEventually another potential suitor (i.e. Philly, Brooklyn, Boston, or even the Clippers) will throw out an offer that Portland would be foolish to say no to. If the fear of Lillard being unhappy anywhere else besides Miami doesn’t scare off competing offers, Miami could lose out on their only path to truly upgrading this offseason. It seems like the Heat have sufficiently ruined the Tyler Hero relationship and at this point, likely need a third team to get involved to bring Lillard to South Beach. Should they strike out, I’m not sure what Miami does with the rest of their offseason, but I can already hear the Joel Embiid to Miami rumors starting up. Shout out to you Miami Heat and your fanbase for taking the torch from the Knicks as the team who thinks every disgruntled superstar wants to play for their team.\n\nMilwaukee Bucks\n\nWhat Success Looks Like: Without overspending, bringing back Brook Lopez and Khris Middleton in that order. Also finding veteran-minimum contracts that will fit with or contribute to a championship core.\n\nSignings/Trades: Khris Middleton (UFA signed 3-year, $102 million), Brook Lopez (UFA signed 2-year, $48 million), Jae Crowder (UFA signed 1-year, $3.1 million), Malik Beasley (UFA signed 1-year $2.7 million), Robin Lopez (UFA signed 1-year, $2.21 million)\n\nInitial Reaction: There wasn’t much for the Bucks to do past bringing back both Lopez and Middleton so let’s talk about the value for each contract compared to rest of the market. At $23 and $24 million a year over two years, the Lopez deal is a steal. He was easily the best center in this free agent class, is still one of the best two-way centers in the league, and if he wanted to, Lopez could have signed elsewhere for much more money (just ask Houston about that apparently). Milwaukee could not afford the lose Lopez so locking him up for the next two season gives Giannis the assurance his frontcourt running mate will be by his side for at least another two title chases.\n\nAs for the Middleton contract, he’ll be getting paid at a level commensurate with an All-Star level difference maker, something he hasn’t been for the Bucks two out of the last three seasons. More than anything, Middleton’s biggest issue has been availability. Last season Middleton played in only 33 regular season games ahead of the postseason and he hasn’t played more than 70 games in a season since 2018–19. When he’s on the court and playing well, Milwaukee is as hard a team to beat as anyone in the East. When he’s unavailable, their lack of shooting and shot creation can be a problem and we see early Bucks playoff exits. Next year is a big year for the 2021 Champs who have hired a new head coach in Adrian Griffin and are just two seasons away from Giannis likely becoming an unrestricted free agent. Assuming he plays out this current contract, I can guarantee he rejects his player-option in the summer of 2025. Even if Giannis wants to re-sign in Milwaukee, by 2025, his expected $51 million a year is a gross underpay. Unless he’s leaving the Bucks more room to sign a true star (highly unlikely) he’s going to want a new contract as soon as he can get one. The championship window for this team is open as long as Giannis is on the roster however, should Milwaukee fail to make another deep postseason run soon, we could see Giannis closing that window on his way out of town.\n\nTransaction Update: AJ Green (RFA re-signed 3-year, $6.3 million)\n\nMinnesota Timberwolves\n\nWhat Success Looks Like: Finding a trade partner for Karl Anthony-Towns before the start of training camp this fall. Also avoid signing long-term contracts until their cap sheet is in better shape.\n\nSignings/Trades: Anthony Edwards (singed 5-year, $205.9 million designated rookie-extension) Naz Reid (signed veterans-extension 3-year, $42 million), Shake Milton (UFA signed 2-year, $10 million), Nickeil Alexander-Walker (UFA signed 2-year, $9 million), Troy Brown Jr (UFA signed 2-year, $8 million), Luka Garza (singed two-way contract)\n\nInitial Reaction: Including the Naz Reid extension , the Timberwolves are paying around $90 million dollars next year on the center position alone. I’d say that’s not the best way to allocate their salary cap but what should we expect from Minnesota. For the last decade plus, the Timberwolves have been one of the most mismanaged franchises in the NBA. It would appear their new ownership group has no intention of turning things around and since taking over the team last season, other than getting Anthony Edwards extended (which I could argue wasn’t even a decision), have approved nothing but bad moves. Last summer’s trade for Rudy Gobert set this franchise back several years with the amount of draft picks Minnesota spent to acquire him. To make matters worse, Gobert had a down season last year putting up the worst defensive win shares in his career and wasn’t selected as either an All-Star or for the All-Defensive team.\n\nIf all that wasn’t bad enough, Gobert’s general presence on the court made operating on offense more difficult for both franchise building blocks, Anthony Edwards and Karl-Anthony Towns. It’s one thing when a team trades for a player and that player fails to live up to the lofty expectations the team has for him. It’s another thing entirely when a player not only disappoints with his performance but by simply being on the court is negatively impacting the performance of a more valuable player. The Timberwolves should have never traded for Gobert but now that they have and are stuck with him, they should find a way to move their other center, Karl-Anthony Towns, while they still can. For all the talent he poses, when it comes to winning games, Towns has not been able to move the needle. Had it not been for the one Jimmy Butler season or the drafting and quick maturation of Anthony Edwards, I don’t know that Towns would have a playoff appearance on his resume. There are several teams rumored to be interested in trading for Towns services. The question is do the Timberwolves have the foresight to accept the best offer for Towns or will they insist on keeping him and holding out false hope that he will become more than just a really tall shooter?\n\nNew Orleans Pelicans\n\nWhat Success Looks Like: Finding a point guard so it’s not just Jose Alvarado. Also adding shooting to go with as many Zion lineups as possible.\n\nSignings/Trades: Herb Jones (RFA signed 4-year, $56.2 million), Cody Zeller (UFA signed 1-year, $3.2 million) E.J. Liddell (Taxpayer mid-level exception signed 3-year, $6.2 million)\n\nInitial Reaction: Not a lot going on in New Orleans this free agency and that’s not a surprise nor is it a bad thing. The only thing New Orleans needs to be a top three seed out West next year is a healthy Zion Williamson and largely bringing back their core from last season. The Herb Jones extension is amazing value for such a good defender and more than capable offensive talent. If Jones can improve his three-point shooting from last season even slightly, he’s one of the more desirable three-and-d wings in the league. When this team is healthy, a closing lineup of Jose Alvarado, C.J. McCollum, Brandon Ingram, Herb Jones, and Zion Williamson matches up well with any other Western Conference team not named Denver (where maybe they swap out Alvarado for Jonas Valanciunas or Larry Nance Jr. to bang with Jokic down low).\n\nNew York Knicks\n\nWhat Success Looks Like: Unless they are big whale hunting, not giving away their asset chest. Also, adding a shooter or an additional shot-creator on a reasonable contract.\n\nSignings/Trades: Donte DiVincenzo (UFA signed 4-year, $50 million), Josh Hart (player-option signed 1-year, $12.96 million), Miles McBride (team-option 1-year, $1.83 million), Jacob Toppin (signed 1-year, $1.12 million)\n\nInitial Reaction: Getting Donte DiVincenzo for middle of the market money is great value and at just 26-years-old, his contract aligns well with the timeline of this Knicks core. He’s an above average shooter from deep with the ability to get to the rim and defend at a high level. I doubt this addition blows anyone away but what the Knicks are doing should allow them more versatility within their lineups. Now with three, maybe four players capable of guarding positions 1–4 comfortably (Barrett, Hart, DiVincenzo, and maybe Grimes), the Knicks are looking more and more like a roster Tom Thibodeau dreams about.\n\nThe Knicks presumed starting five of Jalen Brunson, Josh Hart, R.J. Barrett, Julius Randle, and Mitchell Robinson with a possible closing lineup of Brunson, DiVincenzo, Hart, Barrett, and Randle are good enough to get back to and maybe even win in the second round of the postseason. Over the previous three seasons, I have been critical of Thibodeau and how he implements his rotations and manages minutes. In his defense, Thibodeau has yet to coach a true star in New York and so he’s had to find ways to win with a roster whose greatest strength this most recent season was tenacity. Slowly but surely the Knicks are acquiring more and more talent and unless a star forces his way to MSG soon, I wouldn’t advise NY to do anything drastic to change the positive trajectory they’re on. If the Finals last season taught us anything it’s that there’s nothing wrong with simply being consistently good (see the Heat) or being patient in your process and not panicking every offseason that doesn’t end in a title (see the Nuggets).\n\nOklahoma City Thunder\n\nWhat Success Looks Like: Adding some veteran depth to backup their young starters, preferably veterans with postseason experience.\n\nSignings/Trades: Davis Bertans (via trade: sent out Derick Lively II to Dallas), Victor Oladipo (via trade: traded sent cash considerations to Miami), Rudy Gay, Usman Garuba, TyTy Washington (via trade: sent out Patty Mills to Atlanta in three team trade with Houston), Jack White (UFA signed 1-year, $3.9 million), Keyonte Johnson (singed two-way contract)\n\nInitial Reaction: While plenty of basketball people are expecting next year to be somewhat of a breakout for OKC, the Thunder are still wisely in asset acquisition mode. Almost all their transactions this offseason are less about this upcoming season and notably include future draft picks. With 21 players currently on the roster, I’m not sure how long those recently acquired vets on expiring contracts like Oladipo, Gay, or even Bertans will be around. Of those three players, Bertans would have the most to offer and could find a role without disrupting the rotation of their young core. However, with a player-option on his contract for next season, it will be interesting to see if OKC looks to add Bertans to their rotation or if they don’t, will they be able to find someone willing to trade for him before the deadline, knowing he can opt for free agency next summer.\n\nShai Gilgeous-Alexander is a full-on star and is now the leader of the best young core in the league. The next step for this OKC team is to go from surprising young underdogs to the young team with expectations discussed on the national stage. It might surprise the casual fan to hear that a potential starting lineup of Shai Gilgeous-Alexander, Josh Giddey, Lu Dort, Jalen Williams, and Chet Holmgren could be one of the league’s best lineup’s in 2024. This Thunder roster has length and size at every position (SGA is the short guy at 6’6) allowing them defensive versatility 1 thru 5 and efficient shooters at every position. If I had to pick one team that missed last postseason but I believe can win a series next season, I’d take the Thunder.\n\nOrlando Magic\n\nWhat Success Looks Like: Adding veteran shooters and depth in their front court.\n\nSignings/Trades: Joe Ingles (UFA signed 2-year, $22 million w/ 3rd year player-option), Moritz Wagner (UFA signed, 2-year, $16 million), Goga Bitadze (exercised 23–24 team-option 1-year, $2.07 million)\n\nInitial Reaction: With Johnathan Isaac at $17 million a year (only partially guaranteed) as the highest cap hit currently on the roster, the Magic are both young enough and financially flexible enough that they have options when it comes to a free agency approach this summer. If Orlando wanted to continue gathering future assets, they could have used some of their cap space to take on other teams unwanted contracts in exchange for draft picks in return. Instead, Orlando opted to do a little spending in free agency to bring in a quality veteran shooter and secondary playmaker in Joe Ingles and re-signing one of their better young front-court players in Moritz Wagner.\n\nIf Ingles can stay healthy, he gives Orlando an additional ball handler who provides stretches where Cole Anthony, Jalen Suggs, and Paolo Bachero can play off the ball and have offense facilitated for them rather than having to force the issue. The Magic weren’t far from a playoff team last season and Banchero quietly had one of the best rookie seasons in NBA history. If he continues that ascension and Suggs and Anthony can take a jump from just solid to an above average backcourt, I can see the Magic at least getting a play-in spot over teams like the Bulls, Raptors or even the Nets who may regress a bit in the first full year without KD and Kyrie. If the Thunder are the young team to keep an eye on out East, this Magic team would be my Eastern Conference team on the rise.\n\nPhiladelphia 76ers\n\nWhat Success Looks Like: Figuring out the future direction of this franchise once James Harden leaves, whether via trade this offseason or via free agency next summer.\n\nSignings/Trades: James Harden (exercised 23–24 player-option 1-year, $35.64 million), Paul Reed (RFA signed 3-year, $23.5 million), Danuel House JR (exercised 23–24 player-option 1-year, $4.31 million), Patrick Beverly (UFA signed 1-year, $3.1 million), Mo Bamba (UFA signed 1-year, $2.3 million), Ricky Council IV (signed two-way contract), Terquavion Smith (signed two-way contract)\n\nInitial Reaction: It’s hard to fully evaluate the 76ers offseason without knowing what happens in the next chapter of the James Harden saga. When he opted into the final year of his current deal, it was reported he did so with the understanding the Sixers would work with him to find a trade partner. Any team willing to engage in talks for Harden is doing so understanding it could be a one-year rental since Harden is an unrestricted free agent next summer. I would guess any team trading for him would want some kind of assurance that he wanted to be there past next season (whatever that’s worth given his track record) and that an extension could be worked out. Unlike the scenario in Portland, Philly’s disgruntled star doesn’t want out of town because the team is undergoing a rebuild. On the contrary, the Sixers are on a short list of teams in the East considered to be legitimate Championship contenders.\n\nWith Joel Embiid in the prime of his career and following a season where he was named MVP of the league, Philly cannot afford to trade Harden for young developing prospects or future draft picks. Philly is all in to win a title in 2024 and it will be almost impossible for them to trade Harden and not suffer some regression. Without Harden, this is a roster who’s starting point guard is Pat Bev and second-best player is either Tyrese Maxey or Tobias Harris. The players Philly has signed this summer are solid additions but if the Sixers trade Harden this year and lose Harris for nothing next summer, unless Maxey takes a significant leap and makes an All-NBA team next season, Embiid would be well within his right to demand a trade. Depending on how the next few months play out, “The Process” that Sam Hinkie started all those years ago could come to an end as early as Summer 2024. Will that process result in a championship before then? For now, it certainly doesn’t look like it.\n\nTransaction Update: Montrezl Harrell (UFA signed 1-year, $2.8 million)\n\nPhoenix Suns\n\nWhat Success Looks Like: Finding a point guard to replace Chris Paul. Also adding depth using whatever cap maneuverability they have left.\n\nSignings/Trades: Bradley Beal (via trade sent out Chris Paul, Landry Shamet, and draft picks to Washington), Eric Gordon (UFA singed 2-year, $6.5 million), Damion Lee (UFA signed 2-year, $5.3 million), Yuta Watanabe (UFA signed 2-year, $5 million), Keita Bates-Diop (UFA signed 2-year, $5 million), Drew Eubanks (UFA signed 2-year, $5 million), Josh Okogie (UFA signed 1-year, $2.3 million) Chimezie Metu (UFA signed 1-year, $2.3 million), Jordan Goodwin (via trade: acquired as part of Bradley Beal trade)\n\nInitial Reaction: The Suns are set to have one of the best starting lineups in basketball, even if they don’t have a point guard (Booker, Beal, Durant, Ayton and anyone at the point is a tough five). The biggest issue for this team to overcome will be a lack of depth and potential lack of continuity. Last season there were six teams that won 50 games or more: Milwaukee, Boston, Philly, Denver, Memphis, and Cleveland. Of those six teams, five of them opened the 2022–23 season with the same core-three players from the prior season. Cleveland was the only team out of those six to make a splashy move last offseason, adding Donovan Mitchell to form a core three with Darius Garland and Evan Mobley. The other five teams had seasons that speak to to the value of roster continuity and to having a steady presence and vision within the front office. Phoenix has had a lot of talented rosters these past few seasons, but it’s fair to say one thing they haven’t had is continuity. In the past few seasons alone, this club has had a change in ownership, fired the 2022 Coach Of The Year in Monty Williams, blew up a roster that made The Finals for an aging and injury-wearied Kevin Durant, and most recently traded one of the league’s worst contracts, Chris Paul, for what might be an even worse contract in Bradley Beal (only because Paul’s expires soon).\n\nNow, all this “bad contract” talk won’t age well if Phoenix wins a title before 2026, but I simply don’t think that’s going to happen. Realistically when’s the last time an NBA Champion was built by trading the heart of their rotation to acquire one, let alone two top end stars? By my count it’s happened one time in 20 years, and it just so happened to take place inside a bubble (coincidence?) When the Lakers traded for Anthony Davis in 2019, they essentially had to give New Orleans every valuable player not named LeBron. Not only did this team have the outlier of winning the title in the bubble, but they also did it with greatest player of a generation still playing great late into his 30s. Beside that 2020 Laker team, what other champion even comes close to replicating what the Suns are doing?\n\nTransaction Updated: Signed Bol Bol (UFA signed 1-year, $2.1 million), Traded Cameron Payne to San Antonio for 2024 protected 2nd-round pick\n\nPortland Trailblazers\n\nWhat Success Looks Like: Getting the best return possible in the Damian Lillard trade. If he really is going to strong arm his way to Miami, at least do better than Tyler Hero, a bad Kyle Lowry contract and two draft picks.\n\nSignings/Trades: Jerami Grant (UFA signed 4-year, $160 million), Matisse Thybulle (RFA signed 3-year, $33 million offer sheet), Idou Badji (signed two-way contract), John Butler Jr (signed two-way contract)\n\nInitial Reaction: It’s finally rebuilding time in Portland and Dame does not plan on sticking around for it. The drafting of Scoot Henderson marks the official end of the Lillard era and now the focus becomes getting as many teams involved as need be to make sure Portland comes away from the Lillard trade with at least four 1st-round draft picks. Since Miami is limited in the amount of 1st-rounders they can offer, Portland needs to bring another team to the table to net more picks. Might teams who are loaded with future 1st round picks be interested in giving up one for the services of Tyler Hero?\n\nAssuming Portland wants their future backcourt to revolve around Scoot Henderson, Anfernee Simons, and Shaedon Sharpe, they won’t want Herro or his contract as a return in the trade with Miami. I’m far from a capologist or trade expert but could something like one of these three-team mock trades be beneficial for all parties involved while ensuring Portland receives max value for their franchise’s second greatest player of all time…?\n\nUtah Deal\n\nPortland Receives: John Collins, Duncan Robinson, Utah 2026 & 2027 1st-round picks, Miami 2026 & 2028 1st-round picks\n\nUtah Receives: Tyler Herro, Jamie Jaquez Jr\n\nMiami Receives: Damian Lillard\n\nSummary: Miami gets their guy and can keep Kyle Lowry as a backup. Portland gets a player they can use right away in John Collins & can move Duncan Robinson at some point if he doesn’t crack the rotation. Utah gets a young proven scorer in Herro and a young rookie prospect with some promise in Jamie Jaquez Jr and still have plenty of draft picks stockpiled up.\n\nBrooklyn Deal\n\nPortland Receives: Ben Simmons, Miami 2026 & 2028 1st- round picks, one of Brooklyn’s 2027 1st-round picks\n\nBrooklyn Receives: Tyler Hero, Jusuf Nurkic, Portland 2025 2nd-round pick\n\nMiami Receives: Damian Lillard\n\nSummary: Miami gets Lillard and only has to give up Herro player-wise. Portland gets just three draft picks but also get a player in Ben Simmons who if they believe is fixable, could give them a young All-Star caliber player who doesn’t need shots to be impactful. Brooklyn get to swap out Simmons for two players they can plug right into their lineups and get production from on a team with playoff expectations.\n\nToronto Deal\n\nPortland Receives: Pascal Siakam, Miami 2026 & 2028 1st-round pick, Toronto 2027 1st-round pick\n\nToronto Receives: Tyler Herro, Jusuf Nurkic,\n\nMiami Receives: Damian Lillard\n\nSummary: Miami gets Lillard and only cost them Herro and two draft picks. Portland gets a plug-and-play player in Siakam who fits both a positional need and is young enough to work for Portland’s timeline. Toronto gets a young scorer in Herro, front court depth in Jusuf, and avoid Siakim leaving in free agency for nothing.\n\nSacramento Kings\n\nWhat Success Looks Like: Either replacing Harrison Barnes with a more talented wing or not overpaying to bring him back if he’s their best option. Also, it doesn’t have to be this summer, but getting Sabonis extended now versus later is probably best as his price tag is only likely to increase.\n\nSignings/Trades: Domantas Sabonis (renegotiated-and-extended 4-years, $186 million), Harrison Barnes (UFA signed 3-year, $54 million), Trey Lyles (UFA signed 2-year, $16 million), Alex Len (UFA 1-year, signed $3.1 million), Nerlens Noel (signed 1-year, $2.91 million), Keon Ellis (signed two-way contract)\n\nInitial Reaction: Locking up Barnes at less than $20 million a year for the next three seasons was a prudent move from a franchise that historically hasn’t made those. Similarly, bringing back Trey Lyles for just $8 million a year will help Sacramento keep the core of their playoff rotation together next season. Coming off their most successful season in over 20 years, this is a pivotal offseason for last year’s three seed out West. With Barnes as the team’s biggest free agent decision, I was curious to see if Sacramento could find a talent upgrade (which wasn’t necessarily easy in this free agent class) or if they would prioritize continuity by bringing back the most experienced player on the roster. As for more talented options, the only free agents who would have been clear upgrades at the small or power forward spots were Draymond Green and Jerami Grant. If we compare the contracts for those two players however, (Grant starts at $32 million next season and Green starts at $25 million) versus what is cost to retain Barnes (starting at $17 million next season and ending at $19 million in 2026), it’s hard to argue that the Kings didn’t get the best value for their dollar.\n\nNow the question is, have the Kings done enough to improve upon last season? Before it was clear Draymond was returning to Golden State, I thought the Kings would have been an interesting landing spot had he ended up leaving. Offensively, the Kings had one of the most efficient seasons in NBA history last year and were good enough to force a seven-game series with the defending champions in the opening round of the playoffs. To take that next step, Sacramento needs to improve defensively. Had Draymond decided to leave in pursuit of the highest offer, I would have understood if the Kings overpaid for his elite defensive services as well as his intangibles as a winner. As it stands now, I don’t know if the Kings have done enough to improve upon what they did last season. Signing just one new player means the Kings are banking on the development of their young core of De’Aaron Fox, Domantas Sabonis, and Kevin Huerter and that at least one of them can become an above average defender.\n\nSan Antonio Spurs\n\nWhat Success Looks Like: Assembling a roster with five actual NBA players on it. Also continue being a transfer-hub in these multiple-team trades that net them back draft capital or mid-level veterans\n\nSignings/Trades: Tre Jones (RFA signed 2-year, $20 million), Julian Champagnie (RFA signed 4-year, $12 million, partially guaranteed past 2024), Reggie Bullock (via trade: sent out 2025 2nd round pick to Dallas in three-team trade with Boston), Cameron Payne (via trade: sent out 2024 protected 2nd-round pick to Phoenix) Cedi Osman, Lamar Stevens (via trade: sent out 2027 2nd-round pick to Miami in three-team trade with Cleveland)\n\nInitial Reaction: It was clear and obvious to everyone about a year ago that plans A, B, and C for the San Antonio Spurs this summer was tank to get Victor Wembanyama. Drafting him alone made this a successful offseason but what the Spurs have started to do around the fringes of this roster shouldn’t go unnoticed. Without opening their wallets, the Spurs were able to turn multiple second-round picks into three playable professional basketball players in Reggie Bullock, Cam Payne, and Cedi Osman. Add those three guys to a rotation with Wembanyama, Keldon Johnson, Devonte’ Graham, Tre Jones, Zach Collins, and Khem Birch and now we’re starting to see the outline of a basketball team capable of losing fewer than 60 games.\n\nWhat? You didn’t think I was going to pick this team to do any winning as soon as next year did you? Let’s not get carried away. While using future second-round picks to surround the new face of their franchise with non-two-way contract players is a good move, to be clear, expecting more than a 28-win season from this team next season is farfetched.\n\nToronto Raptors\n\nWhat Success Looks Like: Officially turning the page from the 2019 Championship roster to the next era of the franchise (especially after deciding to fire Nick Nurse).\n\nSignings/Trades: Jakob Poeltl (UFA signed 4-year, $78 million), Dennis Schroder (UFA signed 2-year, $25.4 million), Gary Trent (exercised player-option 1-year, $18.56 million), Jalen McDaniels (UFA signed 2-year, $9.2 million), Jeff Dowtin (RFA signed 1-year, $2.01 million)\n\nInitial Reaction: The Raptors still have some work to do when it comes to transitioning this roster from a middling Play-in team and must decide whether they are trying to contend in the next couple seasons or whether they are taking a long-term building approach through multiple drafts. Let’s explore each of the two paths as I see it and what it could look like depending on the approach they decide.\n\nHitting the rebuild button: With several very tradable players on their roster, Toronto would only need to exercise some patience, allow the 2023–24 trade market to take shape, identify the players they want to move and start collecting those future assets baby! First, let’s look at the players on expiring deals that could be moved before the 2024 deadline if Toronto find themselves among the bottom of the standings.\n\nPlayers On Expiring Contracts 2024; Pascal Siakam, Gary Trent Jr., OG Anunoby, Thaddeus Young, Otto Porter Jr.,\n\nThe big name there is obviously Siakam, who recently expressed his interest to stay in Toronto long-term. I think it’s more likely they get an extension done than move him. Gary Trent Jr. is the easiest to trade should Toronto turn sellers and he could help a lot of contending teams next season. The Raptors could absolutely get a 1st-round pick for him. Anunoby has a player option for 2024–25 so if a team trading for him also thinks they can sign him long-term, he could go for multiple 1st-round picks. Thaddeus Young and Otto Porter Jr. could also be players who teams in need of depth could call about closer to the deadline. With the new CBA helping make future 2nd round picks more valuable than ever, both players could fetch a future 2nd-rounder in return.\n\nPlayers On Deals Through At Least 2025; Jakob Poeltl, Dennis Schroder, Chris Boucher, Gradey Dick,\n\nUnless there’s a big return on the other side, trading Gradey Dick doesn’t make sense if Toronto is rebuilding. Next, having just re-signed Poeltl this summer, he cannot be traded until mid-December. At just $19.5 million a year for the next three seasons, unless teams are throwing multiple unprotected 1st-round picks at them, Toronto is going to want to hold on to Poeltl. Chris Boucher is an interesting name and could have some trade value, but I think he’s more valuable to Toronto on the court than anything they might get for him in return. That leaves Dennis Schroder who they just signed to a two-year deal this offseason. The Schroder signing gives Toronto a serviceable stop-gap option between Fred Van Fleet and whoever the next lead guard becomes but is also a very tradable contract and a player who can step in right away and contribute on a contending roster. Unless Toronto is firmly on their way back to the postseason by January 2024, expect to see Schroder’s name pop up in trade rumors a lot these next two years.\n\nMoving To Contender Tier: For Toronto to move to contender territory out East, they’ll need to add at least one more All-Star while hoping Scottie Barnes continues his accession and will soon make his All-Star or even better, All-NBA team debut. The more likely part of that equation is the later as Barnes is only 21 years old and headed into just his third season. The hard part in that equation is finding a semi-realistic path to acquiring an additional All-Star to play with Pascal Siakam. Allow me to play fantasy GM again, and play in a world where Toronto gets aggressive in pursuit of another All-Star…\n\nPaul George: Paul George has a player-option on his contract for the 2024–25 season. I don’t think Steve Balmer and that front office are going to lose George for nothing so if they no longer believe a Kawhi/PG one-two is the way to go, George could be moved anytime between now and next summer. Would Toronto be interested in trying something like what they did with Kawhi Leonard five years ago and trade for just one guaranteed year of George? Say next summer, George opts into the final year of his deal and works out a trade with the Clippers sending him to Toronto and Anunoby, Trent Jr (both signs and trades), Chris Boucher and at least one unprotected 1st-round pick out to LA.\n\nUtah Jazz\n\nWhat Success Looks Like: Using their cap space to facilitate trades where they agree to take on unwanted contracts from other teams in exchange for draft capital in return.\n\nSignings/Trades: John Collins (via trade: sent out Rudy Gay and 2026 2nd round pick to Atlanta), Jordan Clarkson (renegotiation-and-extended 2-year, $28.7 million), Talen Horton-Tucker (exercised player-option 1-year, $11.02 million), Omer Yurtseven (UFA signed 2-year, $5.46 million)\n\nInitial Reaction: The Jazz will almost never land the highly sought after free agents so despite the amount of cap space they have, look for them to reach the salary cap floor in other ways. Trading for John Collins is as close as it gets to landing a big name though I question how he fits into their front-court rotation when Lauri Markkanen and Walker Kessler are currently the starters. Surely they aren’t going to ask the now highest paid player on their team who they just traded for to come off the bench, are they? Since it only cost Utah the remains of Rudy Gay and a 2nd-round pick to acquire Collins, if he doesn’t find a role and they do ultimately look to trade him, they won’t need much back for it to be a net positive return. As for the rest of their moves this summer, there isn’t much to analyze. Bringing back Jordan Clarkson and Talen Horton-Tucker should help this team at least maintain their level of play from last season. Whether or not the Jazz take that next step and become a playoff team depends mainly on the ceiling of the Markkanen, Collin Sexton one-two punch.\n\nThe more interesting question is how patient are Danny Ainge and this new ownership group willing to be during this rebuild? After trading the franchise’s two best players just an offseason ago, Utah has already done a good job putting together a respectable roster that gives promising young coach, Will Hardy, a competitive chance every night. But how many wins do they actually want? Overachieving in the regular season is fun but this team isn’t anywhere near contending. With control/protection status on their own 1st-round draft picks for the foreseeable future, at what point does Utah consider spending a season in full tank mode? Now, it’s worth noting that the Jazz have a lot of other team’s future picks and may not need to tank to end up in the draft lottery. You might recall Danny Angie pulled this move with the Celtics when he traded the dying embers of Paul Peirce and KG to Brooklyn in exchange for what felt like a decade worth of Nets draft picks (picks which Boston later turned into Jason Taytum and Jaylen Brown). For perspective, here’s what the Utah draft war chest looks like, not including their own:\n\nCleveland and Minnesota 2025 1st, Cleveland and Minnesota 2026 1st-round swap rights, Cleveland 2027 1st, Los Angeles Lakers 2027 1st (top-four protected), Minnesota 2027 1st, Cleveland 2028 1st-round swap rights, Utah 2029 1st, Cleveland 2029 1st, Minnesota 2029 1st (top-five protected)\n\nWashington Wizards\n\nWhat Success Looks Like: The opposite of whatever the hell they’ve been doing since the Bradley Beal trade.\n\nSignings/Trades: Jordan Poole (via trade: sent Chris Paul to Golden State), Kyle Kuzman (UFA signed 4-year, $90 million), Tyus Jones (via trade: sent Kristaps Porzingis to Boston in three-team trade with Memphis), Landry Shamet (via trade: sent Bradley Beal to Phoenix), Danilo Gallinari (via trade: sent Kristaps Porzingis to Boston in three-team trade with Memphis), Mike Muscala (via trade: sent Kristaps Porzingis to Boston in three-team trade with Memphis), Patrick Baldwin Jr (via trade: sent Chris Paul to Golden State), Ryan Rollins (via trade: sent Chris Paul to Golden State),"
