        "text": "No one can write off Bob Myers’ contribution to the Dubs’ success. The 49-year-old played an instrumental role in roping a strong roster around Stephen Curry. Eventually, he reaped the benefits, helping GSW win 4 rings in 6 Finals in his 11-year stint as the GM. Last year, he passed on the torch to Mike Dunleavy Jr, igniting a new era, and months later Klay Thompson stomped out of the franchise. Amid the chaos, a popular Bay Area radio show weighed Dunleavy’s impact after inheriting the team in an unideal situation.\n\nIt’s a no-brainer that the Warriors dynasty has ended after Klay’s exit. Even though the team still has Steph, it needs a lot of repair to call it a championship-caliber team again. Importantly, to call itself a dynasty again. Evan Giddings of 95.7 The Game podcast dropped an interesting analogy, describing the current state of the franchise. He agreed that the Dubs a top franchise, however, “He (Dunleavy Jr) took over a Ferrari with 200,000 miles. He took over a great car, but you’re not really able to drive it too much further.”\n\nThe podcaster compared the franchise to a supercar, but the only downside is that the superstars who’ve been driving that supercar are gradually getting old. Nevertheless, Giddings dropped a few tips to Dunleavy on driving the seasoned car.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nArticle continues below this ad\n\nGiddings continued, “You got to figure out when to hit the gas when to rev up, when can you really flex going from 0 to 60. That kind of thing he’s got to gauge.” Importantly, he didn’t forget to mention that, “It’s a hard thing to do.” So far, the biggest damage in Dunleavy’s portfolio is losing a storied sharpshooter Klay Thompson, who had once expressed his desire to retire as a Warriors player.\n\nBob Myers and Ferrari – an unreal coincidence\n\nWhile Evan Giddings brought up the ‘Ferrari’ analogy, the supercar has actually played a part in Myers’ life. When he took up the job in 2012, the team was valued at $450 million and Myers himself described the team as “one of the worst bottom five franchises,” in his appearance on JJ Redick’s podcast. But, the GM undeniably transformed the franchise into a $8.3 billion superpower in no time.\n\nSpeaking of the transformation, Myers made an interesting analogy. He said, “I thought (when) I was hired, I was gonna drive like an old VW bus but the job in the end turned into trying to drive a Ferrari.” However, according to Giddings, he not only drove the supercar but also transformed the franchise into one.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nArticle continues below this ad\n\nNot to forget, Myers’ efforts in bringing Kevin Durant to the side, getting two back-to-back rings, and appearing in three straight Finals. However, the only question that would ring in every Dub fan’s mind is: Can Mike Dunleavy take the franchise to new heights? It’s indeed a million-dollar question. So far in the 2024 off-season drama, the Dubs haven’t made much of a move. They lost Chris Paul and Klay Thompson. In return, they’ve stacked the team with De’Anthony Melton, Kyle Anderson, and Buddy Hield.\n\nWill these trades compensate for Klay Thompson’s loss? Let us know in the comments below.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nArticle continues below this ad\n\nBefore you go, do not forget to check out Shaquille O’Neal’s ex-agent, Leonard Armato, to open up about the infamous Shaq-Kobe feud.
