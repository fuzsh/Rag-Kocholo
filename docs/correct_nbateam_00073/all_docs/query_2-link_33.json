        "text": "Klay Thompson: Well, I love Mike Dunleavy. I grew up watching Mike play in Portland at Jesuit High School. For him to be McDonalds (All-American) and then go to Duke and then go to the league, that was a huge deal for Oregon. We didn’t have a lot of guys doing that. Now to be working with him, it’s crazy. The world’s so small.\n\nTrayce Jackson-Davis to sign three-year deal with Warriors\n\nTrayce Jackson-Davis plans to sign a three-year deal with a team option in Year 3, a league source told Fieldhouse Files. And new Warriors general manager Mike Dunleavy Jr., a former Pacer, said Jackson-Davis will be part of the 15-man roster right away. That’s important because most players selected after about 40 are headed either for a two-way deal or non-guaranteed contract. Oh, and Jackson-Davis’ agent? That’s James Dunleavy — Mike’s brother."
