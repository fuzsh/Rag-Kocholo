        "text": "Makes SL debut\n\nPost has been dealing with a minor leg injury he sustained during a pre-draft workout and was held out of the California Classic and early portions of Las Vegas Summer League before suiting up Friday. Post possesses a stretch-big skillset, shooting 38.8 percent from long range across five collegiate seasons while standing at seven feet tall.\n\nPosts full stat line\n\nSpencer tied for the team high in assists Wednesday while committing only one turnover. He was also active defensively, logging four steals. The 28-year-old will be on a two-way contract this season for Golden State but will likely spend most of his time with the team's G League affiliate.\n\nJoins Golden State on two-way deal\n\nPlowden has been a standout during the Summer League, averaging 16.6 points, 3.4 rebounds, 1.8 assists, 1.2 blocks and 2.6 three-pointers across five appearances. He's likely to be a featured player in the G League for Santa Cruz this season."
