Walker then made back-to-back 3-point shots to tie it at 136 in the final 37 seconds.\n\nThe game, organized by Magic Johnson's foundation, drew 14,758 fans to Los Angeles' Staples Center.\n\nJacobson scored 18 points for the College All-Stars, coached by Johnson, and Jay Williams had 17. Tayshaun Prince, Chris Wilcox and Qyntel Woods added 16 points each.\n\nThe NBA All-Stars, coached by comedian Steve Harvey, were led by Paul Pierce's 23 points. Corey Maggette and Darius Miles had 17 each, and Derek Fisher scored 15.\n\nThe game culminated four days of events benefiting the foundation's Taylor Michaels Scholarship Program, named for the former chief operating officer of Magic Johnson Enterprises who died in 1997.\n\nThe scholarship provides funds for college-bound students facing difficult socio-economic conditions. The events raised dlrs 1.1 million, a foundation spokeswoman said."
