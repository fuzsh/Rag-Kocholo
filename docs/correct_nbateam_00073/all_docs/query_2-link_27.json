        "text": "The Warriors made the first major decision of their offseason last week, naming Mike Dunleavy Jr. as their next general manager. The next big choice comes Thursday in Brooklyn at the NBA Draft.\n\nGolden State has the No. 19 pick and plenty of motivation to use it on a win-now plan, with Stephen Curry pushing to extend his prime at age 35.\n\nExactly how the Warriors will do so remains an open question: Should they trade up for a higher-caliber rookie, package the pick with a young player to pursue an established NBA veteran, or stay put and make the pick, trusting their scouting?\n\nOur writers make the case for each path:\n\nWhy they should trade for a veteran\n\nWith Curry still playing at a high level, why would the Warriors want to take on another project?\n\nThe two-timeline plan was good in theory, but those young players in the second wave, beyond Jordan Poole, haven’t made the leaps the Warriors hoped they would at this point.\n\nAnd despite being booted in the Western Conference semifinals last month – perhaps a fitting end to a wonky season – the Warriors’ focus remains on keeping their championship window open for as long as possible. That alone might justify making a trade to get a more established veteran player who could fit the Warriors’ system well.\n\nThe Warriors can’t trade their No. 19 pick until draft night, but that doesn’t mean they can’t cut a deal and pair whoever they take with a young player, such as Jonathan Kuminga or Poole, in a deal to get a seasoned talent.\n\nThey could use an additional frontcourt player who can help spread the floor. Perhaps the Warriors could phone Minnesota or Washington to inquire about Karl-Anthony Towns or Kristaps Porzingis.\n\n—Madeline Kenney\n\nWhy they should trade up\n\nUnder the NBA’s new collective bargaining agreement, the draft is now the Warriors’ most crucial team-building mechanism. They should treat it as such on Thursday and trade up from pick No. 19.\n\nThe new spending rules are punitive towards big-spending teams to the point of being petty. The Warriors will no longer be able to sign players not already on the roster to anything but a league-minimum deal. Trades, too, will become much harder under the new rules.\n\nBut the draft will still allow the Warriors to acquire a player worth more than that league minimum. The higher they draft, the larger the rookie’s contract. Remember: Before James Wiseman was traded, he was the fifth highest-paid Warrior.\n\nThat’s a big deal, because if the Warriors want to make a larger move at some point this season or next, they’ll need as many solid salary bricks as they can muster. Moving up in the draft not only creates a more significant brick for future trades, but, more importantly, it brings in a better player.\n\nThe NBA Draft is always important, but if the Warriors will have to work the fringes to add players moving forward, they simply need to nail this draft pick. And while there’s always the hope that the perfect player falls to No. 19, the likelihood is that the kind of player who can make the kind of immediate and long-term impact the Warriors need is likely closer to the top of the draft.\n\nThe Warriors can go big — trading Jonathan Kuminga for an earlier pick — or play it cool — a few future assets to move a few spots up, but either way, it behooves them to be aggressive and get their top realistic target come June 22.\n\nThe Big Trade: Jonathan Kuminga, No. 19 to Indiana for No. 7. Warriors select Cam Whitmore, Villanova wing.\n\nThe Modest Trade: No. 19, two future second-round picks to Atlanta for No. 15. Warriors select Gradey Dick, Kansas wing.\n\n—Dieter Kurtenbach\n\nWhy they should stick at No. 19\n\nIf new general manager Dunleavy and the Warriors can’t swing a trade to move up in the draft, they may find a Warriors-ready player to pick at that spot. The drama around Kuminga’s playing time has most to do with the balance struck between a raw talent’s development and the team’s need for mistake-free minutes.\n\nWith the 19th pick, the Warriors have a few options who may not need as much development that could fit into their scheme.\n\nTake Santa Clara product Brandin Podziemski, a 6-foot-4 combo guard with a playing style similar to Donte DiVincenzo or other successful role players such as Lakers’ guard Austin Reaves or Miami’s Caleb Martin. He’s valued in the draft for his intangibles — good feel for the game and grit — with strong outside shot-making potential. Though he may not be seen as a primary playmaker at the NBA level, he’s good at making the right play to keep an offense flowing.\n\nHe’s not yet a strong defender and isn’t as athletic as a lottery pick, but those are the concessions a team makes picking at this spot. Another talented guard who could be available UConn’s Jordan Hawkins, who led the Huskies to the NCAA title.\n\nIf they want to opt for size, maybe they take Iowa’s Kris Murray, Kings wing Keegan Murray’s twin brother. At 6-foot-8 with a 7-foot wingspan, Murray would give the Warriors some much-needed size. He has the qualities to fit into the Warriors’ motion offense: A scoring threat off the ball who is a strong cutter and playmaker.\n\nThe downsides of picking Murry: Unlike his brother, he’s not as strong scoring off the dribble and he’s 23 after opting to return to a starting role with Iowa while his twin entered the draft in 2022. Other wings who could be available at 19 include Xavier’s Colby Jones and Michigan’s Jett Howard.\n\n—Shayna Rubin"
