        "text": "On Monday, it was announced that Golden State Warriors guard Brandin Podziemski had been named to the All-Rookie First Team, where he joins Victor Wembanyama, Chet Holmgren, Jaime Jaquez Jr., and Brandon Miller. It’s one heck of an accomplishment for Podziemski, who was nearly joined by his teammate Trayce Jackson-Davis — the first player out, missing the Second Team by one point.\n\nMaking the All-Rookie team is an awesome accomplishment that Podziemski should certainly celebrate. But how telling is it? Not all of the All-Rookie classes can be as good as 2003-04, when the voters selected LeBron James, Carmelo Anthony, Dwyane Wade, Chris Bosh, and Kirk Hinrich. But usually, when we look back on the All-Rookie teams, they paint a fairly accurate picture as to who emerged as impact players long term.\n\nBut I was curious, so it seemed like a good time to travel back in time ... and look at the 21 Warriors to make the All-Rookie team before Podziemski. It’s worth noting that prior to the 1988-89 season, the NBA only had one All-Rookie team, instead of two. So surely the Dubs would have had a few additional Second-Teamers in there otherwise.\n\nHere’s the full list in reverse chronological order, including some important context: what other players make the All-Rookie team that year, and how the player did in the ensuing season.\n\nEric Paschall — 2019-20 First Team\n\nAll-Rookie teammates: Zion Williamson, Ja Morant, Brandon Clarke, Kendrick Nunn\n\nSophomore stats: 17.4 minutes, 9.5 points, 3.2 rebounds, and 1.3 assists per game\n\nIt pains me to say it, but Paschall kind of represents the worst-case scenario for a player on the All-Rookie team. When you make the team — especially the First Team — it isn’t expected that your best days are already behind you. But that’s what happened for Paschall, who jumped on the scene as a second-round pick on a 15-win squad, playing 1,654 minutes and scoring 837 points ... and then only logging 1,431 more minutes and 715 more points in his career (though of course he could get back to the NBA again some day).\n\nHarrison Barnes — 2012-13 First Team\n\nAll-Rookie teammates: Damian Lillard, Anthony Davis, Bradley Beal, Dion Waiters\n\nSophomore stats: 28.3 minutes, 9.5 points, 4.0 rebounds, and 1.5 assists per game\n\nBarnes kind of falls into the middle ground for expected outcomes. He didn’t fall off, and has gone on to have a solid 12-year career that still has many more seasons left it in. But he and Waiters certainly stand out next to the other three names on that list.\n\nKlay Thompson — 2011-12 First Team\n\nAll-Rookie teammates: Kyrie Irving, Kawhi Leonard, Ricky Rubio, Kenneth Faried, Iman Shumpert, Brandon Knight\n\nSophomore stats: 35.8 minutes, 16.6 points, 3.7 rebounds, and 2.2 assists per game\n\nSometimes I forget that Klay was only drafted one year before Barnes. And it’s always funny to me to remember that he was part of a seven-player First Team, due to a three-way tie (a tie that’s extra funny in hindsight, as Leonard was paired with Shumpert and Knight). Safe to say, becoming a four-time champion and a future Hall of Famer is a great outcome for an All-Rookie selection.\n\nSteph Curry — 2009-10 First Team\n\nAll-Rookie teammates: Tyreke Evans, Brandon Jennings, Darren Collison, Taj Gibson\n\nSophomore stats: 33.6 minutes, 18.6 points, 3.9 rebounds, and 5.8 assists per game\n\nMy goodness, that’s a grim First Team, other than Curry! Though it’s worth noting that the draft class had same late representation after injured Blake Griffin made the team the next year, and then Rubio made it two years later when he joined the NBA.\n\nAnyway, Curry is amazing, but you already knew that.\n\nJason Richardson — 2001-02 First Team\n\nAll-Rookie teammates: Pau Gasol, Tony Parker, Shane Battier, Andrei Kirilenko\n\nSophomore stats: 32.9 minutes, 15.6 points, 4.6 rebounds, and 3.0 assists per game\n\nThe seven-year gap between Barnes and Paschall is understandable, because the Warriors were winning so many games, and not landing in good draft position. But the eight-year gap between J-Rich and Curry? Absolutely brutal.\n\nIt featured: Mike Dunleavy Jr. 3rd overall in 2002 (ahead of four First-Teamers and four Second-Teamers); Mickaël Piétrus 11th overall in 2003 (ahead of two Second-Teamers); Andris Biedriņš 11th overall in 2004 (ahead of three Second-Teamers); Ike Diogu 9th overall in 2005 (ahead of three Second-Teamers); Patrick O’Bryant 9th overall in 2006 (ahead of one First-Teamer and three Second-Teamers); Brandan Wright 8th overall in 2007 (ahead of one First-Teamer and three Second-Teamers); and Anthony Randolph 14th overall in 2008 (ahead of one Second-Teamer).\n\nWhat a time to be alive.\n\nMarc Jackson — 2000-01 First Team\n\nAll-Rookie teammates: Kenyon Martin, Mike Miller, Darius Miles, Morris Peterson\n\nSophomore stats: 12.7 minutes, 4.8 points, 3.3 rebounds, and 0.4 assists per game\n\nBefore Mark Jackson led the Warriors, Marc Jackson led the Warriors ... and inspired this website’s tagline: Unstoppable, baby!\n\nUnfortunately, he peaked his rookie year, and was traded the next season.\n\nAntawn Jamison — 1998-99 Second Team\n\nAll-Rookie teammates: Michael Olowokandi, Cuttino Mobley, Michael Dickerson, Michael Doleac\n\nSophomore stats: 36.2 minutes, 19.6 points, 8.3 rebounds, and 2.1 assists per game\n\nIn a way, you could make the case that Jamison never quite lived up to the hype of his dynamic rookie season, as he would “only” make two All-Star teams in his career. But what a fun and talented player he was.\n\nJoe Smith — 1995-96 First Team\n\nAll-Rookie teammates: Jerry Stackhouse, Michael Finley, Arvydas Sabonis, Damon Stoudamire, Antonio McDyess\n\nSophomore stats: 38.6 minutes, 18.7 points, 8.5 rebounds, and 1.6 assists per game\n\nIt’s easier to appreciate how good Smith’s two-and-a-half-year tenure with the Warriors — he first of 12 NBA teams — was if you don’t look at the list of players drafted after the 1995 No. 1 overall pick.\n\nDonyell Marshall — 1994-95 Second Team\n\nAll-Rookie teammates: Jalen Rose, Juwan Howard, Wesley Person, Eric Montross, Sharone Wright\n\nSophomore stats: 15.1 minutes, 5.5 points, 3.4 rebounds, and 0.8 assists per game\n\nMarshall counts as a Warriors All-Rookie player even though he began his career elsewhere, since he was traded to the Warriors halfway through his rookie season in the Tom Gugliotta trade.\n\nChris Webber — 1993-94 First Team\n\nAll-Rookie teammates: Penny Hardaway, Vin Baker, Jamal Mashburn, Isaiah Rider\n\nSophomore stats: 38.3 minutes, 20.1 points, 9.6 rebounds, and 4.7 assists\n\nWebber’s second-year stats look much nicer before you remember that he was already off the Warriors by then.\n\nLatrell Sprewell — 1992-93 Second Team\n\nAll-Rookie teammates: Robert Horry, Walt Williams, Clarence Weatherspoon, Richard Dumas\n\nSophomore stats: 43.1 minutes, 21.0 points, 4.9 rebounds, and 4.7 assists per game\n\nThe lesson here seems to be that Warriors who make the All-Rookie team often have ugly endings to their tenure with the Dubs. Don’t let it happen, Podz!\n\nBilly Owens — 1991-92 First Team\n\nAll-Rookie teammates: Dikembe Mutombo, Larry Johnson, Steve Smith, Stacey Augmon\n\nSophomore stats: 32.5 minutes, 16.5 points, 7.1 rebounds, and 3.9 assists\n\nOwens lasted a whole three seasons with the Warriors, which seems like quite a lot given some of the names on this list thus far.\n\nTim Hardaway — 1989-90 First Team\n\nAll-Rookie teammates: David Robinson, Vlade Divac, Sherman Douglas, Pooh Richardson\n\nSophomore stats: 39.2 minutes, 22.9 points, 4.0 rebounds, and 9.7 assists per game\n\nWell ... that’s much better!\n\nMitch Richmond — 1988-89 First Team\n\nAll-Rookie teammates: Rik Smits, Charles Smith, Hersey Hawkins, Willie Anderson\n\nSophomore stats: 35.9 minutes, 22.1 points, 4.6 rebounds, and 2.9 assists per game\n\nIt’s not quite drafting Steph Curry, Klay Thompson, and Draymond Green in consecutive drafts, but my goodness ... what a run!\n\nLarry Smith and Joe Barry Carroll — 1980-81\n\nAll-Rookie teammates: Kevin McHale, Kelvin Ransey, Darrell Griffith\n\nSmith’s sophomore stats: 29.9 minutes, 7.1 points, 11.0 rebounds, and 1.1 assists per game\n\nCarroll’s sophomore stats: 34.6 minutes, 17.0 points, 8.3 rebounds, and 0.8 assists per game\n\nWhenever you get two players on the All-Rookie First Team, you know you’ve done something right.\n\nGus Williams — 1975-76\n\nAll-Rookie teammates: Alvan Adams, Lionel Hollins, Joe Meriweather, John Shumate\n\nSophomore stats: 23.5 minutes, 9.3 points, 2.8 rebounds, and 3.6 assists per game\n\nA tough scene. Williams had a great rookie year, struggled a bit his second season, and then moved on to different teams ... where he took off.\n\nJamaal Wilkes — 1974-75\n\nAll-Rookie teammates: John Drew, Scott Wedman, Tommy Burleson, Brian Winters\n\nSophomore stats: 33.1 minutes, 17.8 points, 8.8 rebounds, and 2.0 assists\n\nWilkes’ best days may have come with the Lakers, but things started with the Warriors, and ... OK, maybe that doesn’t make you feel better. I’ll stop talking.\n\nRick Barry and Fred Hetzel — 1965-66\n\nAll-Rookie teammates: Billy Cunningham, Tom Van Arsdale, Dick Van Arsdale\n\nBarry’s sophomore stats: 40.7 minutes, 35.6 points, 9.2 rebounds, and 3.6 assists per game\n\nHetzel’s sophomore stats: 27.6 minutes, 12.2 points, 8.3 rebounds, and 1.4 assists per game\n\nWhat an All-Rookie team! A pair of teammates and a pair of identical twins!\n\nNate Thurmond — 1963-64\n\nAll-Rookie teammates: Jerry Lucas, Gus Johnson, Art Heyman, Rod Thorn\n\nSophomore stats: 41.2 minutes, 16.5 points, 18.1 rebounds, and 2.0 assists per game\n\nAnd here’s where it all started: with Nate Thurmond."
