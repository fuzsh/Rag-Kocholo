        "text": "The Warriors added another versatile guard to their team Thursday night.\n\nGolden State took Santa Clara star Brandin Podziemski with the No. 19 pick in the 2023 NBA Draft.\n\nA four-star recruit out of high school, Podziemski dazzled for the Broncos this season, earning West Coast Conference Newcomer of the Year and Co-Player of the Year awards while averaging 19.9 points, 8.8 rebounds, 3.7 assists and 1.8 steals in 32 games.\n\nPodziemski is considered one of the best shooters in this year’s draft and shot 44% from 3-point range this season. His game has been compared to Donte DiVincenzo and he’s been praised for his ability to rebound at his size.\n\nBut that’s the thing: His 6-foot-4 frame and 6-foot-5 ½ wingspan is a concern. He also has room to improve on the defensive end.\n\nHowever, Podziemski, 20, impressed Warriors during his pre-draft workout last month at Chase Center and seems like he could be a good fit.\n\nThe Warriors kicked off their offseason of retooling their roster with a jaw-dropping trade earlier in the day.\n\nMike Dunleavy Jr.’s first move as the team’s general manager will have Golden State dealing Jordan Poole, Ryan Rollins and two future draft picks to the Washington Wizards for Chris Paul.\n\nBut this is only the beginning of what’s expected to be a hectic offseason for Golden State, who’s actively looking to optimize this championship window.\n\nThe Warriors will have to find solutions to several other questions in the coming weeks. Negotiating a deal to keep Draymond Green, who’s expected to opt out of his $27.6 million player option before the June 29 deadline, is priority No. 1.\n\nBeyond that, the Warriors are at risk of losing six players in free agency. Donte DiVincenzo has a $4.7 million player option, which they anticipate him to decline in the next week.\n\nJaMychal Green and Andre Iguodala are unrestricted free agents, though Iguodala previously said last season would be his last. Meanwhile, Anthony Lamb and two-way players Ty Jerome and Lester Quinones are restricted free agents.\n\nThe Warriors will also have questions to answer surrounding Klay Thompson. He’s set to make $43.2 million in the final year of his current deal, but he and the Warriors could work out an extension, if both sides wanted to.\n\nBut there’s still a little time before those issues will need to be addressed. Free agency opens July 1.\n\nFor now, the Warriors will look forward to welcoming Podziemski to the Bay Area in the coming days."
