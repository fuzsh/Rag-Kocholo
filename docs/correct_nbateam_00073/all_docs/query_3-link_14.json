        "text": "\"We have been looking forward to this day since we first had the vision of building a privately financed state-of-the-art sports and entertainment complex in San Francisco and are excited for what this will bring to the city of San Francisco and the entire Bay Area community. Chase Center and the surrounding area will serve as a destination for the entire community and we will continue to work to make sure it is the best experience possible for everyone to enjoy NBA basketball, concerts, family shows, conventions and more.\"\n\n- Rick Welts, Former President and COO, Golden State Warriors\n\nThis award-winning and record-breaking franchise looks to the future of both its teams and its business to continue to dazzle spectators, fans, and the world - just as it's done since 1946.\n\nThe Golden State Warriors and GSW Arena LLC officially broke ground January 17, 2017 for Chase Center, a state-of-the-art sports and entertainment complex to be built in San Francisco's Mission Bay neighborhood. After two years spent participating in a public planning process, construction began and Chase Center was scheduled to open for the start of the 2019-20 NBA season.\n\nIn September 2019, Chase Center opened to sold-out crowds, rave reviews, and well-managed traffic. It has since hosted a variety of events, including concerts, family shows and conventions, in addition to Warriors basketball. The 18,000-seat Chase Center anchors a district of 11 acres of restaurants, cafes, offices, public plazas and other amenities to serve the Mission Bay neighborhood. Chase Center is located on a major Muni Metro rail line with easy links to BART and other transit options. Chase Center is currently the only privately financed facility of its kind built on private property in the modern era of professional sports.\n\nClick here for the latest information about the Chase Center."
