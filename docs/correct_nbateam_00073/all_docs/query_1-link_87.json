        "text": "Klay Thompson lives what is probably his sweetest moment of the season. The shooting guard is once again a starter after falling out of the starting five in mid-February. He is coming off scoring 32 points against Utah and is averaging 20,3 points with 38% accuracy on three-pointers in his last 10 games. None of which clarifies his future with the Golden State Warriors. Klay ends his contract this summer and the franchise faces the dilemma of extending him.\n\nBoth parties have expressed more than once the desire for its continuity. However, it seems that the Warriors would not be willing to maintain his status on the team's salary scale. Thompson is currently earning $43 million. An unaffordable figure for the medium term of the franchise. In principle, the player would be willing to sign 'low'. But offers from other teams could destabilize Mike Dunleavy Jr.'s plans.\n\nAmong them, Orlando stands out especially. A young group that allows salary flexibility in the short term and that needs shooters like Comer to surround Paolo Banchero and Franz Wagner. According to point Tim Kawakami in The Athletic, the Magic would be willing to break the bank for Klay. The Florida team will enjoy more than 50 million in salary space in the next off-season. Meanwhile, Joe Lacob has made it more or less clear that he intends to significantly cut the luxury tax his team currently pays. Which focuses the attention on the extensions of Thompson and Chris Paul.\n\nKlay's market price remains unknown, but if the Magic come close to his current salary, everything indicates that the Warriors will abandon that fight.\n\n(Cover photo by Sean M.
