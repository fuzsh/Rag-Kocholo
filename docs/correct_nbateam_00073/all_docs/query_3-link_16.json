        "text": "The Golden State Warriors are a National Basketball Association (NBA) franchise and compete as a member of the league’s Western Conference Pacific Division. Established as the Philadelphia Warriors in 1946, the team relocated to the San Francisco Bay Area in 1962 before moving to Oakland in 1972. Since then, the team has been playing at the Oracle Arena in Oakland. The Warriors are tied with the Chicago Bulls with six championships, only behind the Boston Celtics and the Los Angeles Lakers. Two players of the team, Wilt Chamberlain and Stephen Curry, have won the NBA’s Most Valuable Player award.\n\nThe Golden State Warriors’ franchise value has grown strongly over the past few years. In 2022, the franchise had an estimated value of seven billion U.S. dollars. The significant growth of its franchise value made the team one of the most valuable NBA franchise that year. The team’s revenue has also risen steadily over the past decade. In the 2021/22 season, the Warriors generated around 765 million U.S. dollars in revenue.\n\nIn 2021/22, the regular season home attendance of the franchise was 740,624, an average of 18,064 per game. The overall average attendance in the NBA stood at 17,184 in the same season. The Warriors had about 11.68 million Facebook fans and almost 7.8 million Twitter followers."
