        "text": "The Clippers are looking to add depth after Mason Plumlee departed to the Phoenix Suns and with Russell Westbrook likely to be traded. Jones Jr., nicknamed “Airplane Mode” for his vertical and dunking ability, will be a great addition for the Clippers as they look to reshape their bench.\n\nWhile only a 31.6% career three-point shooter, he makes up for it in other ways. He has a nice first step, attacks hard on drives, and can fly through the air. However, his most important attribute is his defense, being able to guard positions one through four, and can hold his own against centers when needed. Jones Jr. was arguably the best defender on the NBA runner-ups and should fit perfectly on any contender.\n\nAt 27, Jones Jr. is in his prime. After many stops, “Airplane Mode” has carved out a nice career as a role player. Additionally, Jones Jr. has two finals appearances to his credit.\n\nDerrick Jones Jr.’s Rise\n\nA journeyman, Jones Jr. has played for five teams in seven years. He came into the league in 2016 after going undrafted. The wing started his career in Phoenix. In 2018, he signed with the Miami Heat, only appearing in 14 games in his first season with the team. The 2018-19 season saw Jones Jr. become a rotational piece, appearing in 60 games and starting 14. In 2020, he and the Heat made the NBA Finals in the bubble, where they lost to the Los Angeles Lakers.\n\nAfter the 2020 finals appearance, Jones Jr. was traded to the Portland Trail Blazers and, after one season, signed with the Chicago Bulls. He then played two seasons in Chicago, later signing a one-year contract with the Dallas Mavericks. After appearing in 76 regular season games, Jones Jr. played 22 playoff games, including another Finals appearance.\n\nHe averaged 8.6 points, 1.0 assists per game, and 3.3 rebounds per game in the 2023-2024 NBA regular season. After the trade early in the 2023-2024 NBA season, it was apparent that the Clippers lacked depth."
