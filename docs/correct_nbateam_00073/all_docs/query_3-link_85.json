        "text": "Steve Kerr on Team USA: 'When we play against teams, it's the biggest game of their lives'\n\nSouth Sudan, the African nation that gained its independence just 13 years ago and is about to play in the Olympics for the first time, led for more than half the game and had a chance to win at the end. But Carlik Jones’ runner off the glass missed with about 4 seconds left, and the Americans survived. “I’m going to be honest: I like those better than the blowouts,” James said as he walked off the court. “At least we get tested.” Oh, they got tested — by a team that came into the game as 43½-point underdogs , according to BetMGM Sportsbook. “A good reminder that when we play against teams, it’s the biggest game of their lives,” U.S. coach Steve Kerr said. “We have to expect everyone to play like that.”\n\nBut among the positives that can be taken from an otherwise extremely narrow win in which embarrassment was barely avoided, a big one is James both emerged as the primary option on offense and also didn’t bog down the flow for everyone else. “He’s just got such an incredible competitive spirit and confidence in the clutch, and I think the whole team was embarrassed at halftime to be totally outplayed and down 14,” USA coach Steve Kerr said. “And then I don’t think he was real thrilled about me not starting him in the third quarter, but I thought that next group that we put out there really did a good job defensively. And I looked down a couple of times and I can see LeBron champing at a bit to be out on the floor. As soon as he got out there and he went to work, he was brilliant.”\n\nStephen Curry: 'Defense is the thing that helps you win championships, medals'\n\nMarial Shayok led all scorers with 24 points for South Sudan and Jones had a triple-double — 15 points, 11 rebounds and 11 assists. The teams will meet in group play in the Paris Olympics on July 31. “It’s basketball. It happens,” U.S. guard Stephen Curry said. “You want to play perfect every game; it doesn’t happen. But can you dig deep and do the little things that help you win? Offense can come and go, but defense is the thing that helps you win championships, medals, all that stuff.”"
