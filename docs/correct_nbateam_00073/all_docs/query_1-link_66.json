        "text": "Jaren Jackson Jr. was in attack mode.\n\nThe Memphis Grizzlies forward, facing off against the Timberwolves' towering frontcourt duo of Karl-Anthony Towns and Rudy Gobert, stayed on the attack while the team appeared on the cusp of pulling off an upset Thursday. The Grizzlies led for most of the first three quarters, but their All-Star forward dealt with foul trouble.\n\nWhen Jackson left the floor early in the fourth, the Timberwolves took the lead and never relinquished it as Memphis fell 118-103 at Target Center in Minneapolis.\n\nThe Timberwolves (30-11) got a dominant second half from Anthony Edwards, who led Minnesota with 28 points. He scored 26 of those in the second half.\n\nJackson led Memphis (15-26) with a game-high 36 points.\n\nHere are some takeaways from the game.\n\nNew Grizzlies starting lineup\n\nMemphis unveiled its 23rd starting lineup in the 41st game of the season. John Konchar joined Jackson, Luke Kennard, Vince Williams Jr. and Xavier Tillman Sr. This lineup pushed the Grizzlies to a 13-point lead in the first quarter with efficient offense.\n\nOnce the Grizzlies made substitutions, however, the Timberwolves went on a 16-3 run to tie the game at the end of the quarter. Memphis continues to find effective starting combinations, but the breakdowns often are coming when its lack of experienced depth is shown in the reserves.\n\nGrizzlies (almost) survive Jaren Jackson Jr.'s foul trouble\n\nThe Timberwolves had no answer for Jackson. He had 23 points in the first half and was well on his way to a dominant third quarter after two quick baskets to get to 28 points. However, he picked up his fourth foul with 9:39 left in the third and was forced to sit the remainder of the quarter. This was a moment where it felt like the Timberwolves would create separation, but Kennard's hot shooting led to a 15-point quarter that kept Memphis ahead.\n\nBut Jackson picked up his fifth foul early in the fourth quarter, and that's when Minnesota made its run and never looked back.\n\nMike Conley strikes against former team\n\nThe Timberwolves went on an 11-0 run early in the fourth, where the Grizzlies went from leading by four to trailing by seven. Former Grizzlies point guard Mike Conley scored the first eight points, then assisted on the following 3-pointer.\n\nGrizzlies fans are all too familiar with the steadiness that Conley plays with. While Towns and Edwards flashed in spurts, it was Conley who consistently gave Memphis trouble on both ends. He finished with 17 points, 10 assists and two steals.\n\nWhat's next\n\nThursday's matchup started a stretch of seven games — the first four on the road — in 13 days for the Grizzlies, whose next game is Saturday against the Chicago Bulls. This is their first meeting of the season."
