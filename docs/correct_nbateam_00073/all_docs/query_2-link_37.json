        "text": "It’s music to new Indiana Pacers forward Mike Dunleavy Jr.’s ears that he isn’t hearing the boos anymore.\n\nDunleavy was drafted by Golden State with the third overall pick in 2002 after his junior season at Duke. Much was expected from the versatile guard-forward upon arrival to Oakland, Calif., after he was selected before the likes of Amare Stoudemire, Caron Butler, Nene, Oakland’s own Drew Gooden and much later in the draft Tayshaun Prince and Carlos Boozer. And with the high pick came expectations Dunleavy would be an NBA all-star.\n\n“People wanted a lot more out of me,” Dunleavy said. “I didn’t really look at it like that like, ‘I’m the third pick and I have to do this.’ I just tried to play the right way. What happened happened. It didn’t work out. But being the third pick, I earned that.”\n\nDunleavy averaged 5.7 points as a rookie and 11.7 and 13.4 points the next two seasons, respectively. While he had respectable growth, Warriors fans expected a superstar.\n\nBefore the 2005-06 season, expectations grew much greater when the Warriors signed him to five-year, $45 million contract. And after Dunleavy started last season slowly, Golden State fans began booing him after any mistake was made at home.\n\nIt got so bad that even if he hit several shots in a row he would get booed again once he missed. And even when he had 18 points, 13 rebounds, three assists and a blocked shot in his final Warriors game against the Los Angeles Clippers on Jan. 15, the home fans still booed.\n\n“At first it was disappointing because I am a sports fan,” Dunleavy said. “I don’t think that’s necessary if you’re out there playing your (butt) off and trying to help the team win. If you’re not playing hard and messing up off the court, I can understand. But it got to be ridiculous. …\n\n“It affected other people more than it affected me. My teammates, coaches and the staff, it was rattling them more than me.”\n\nThe booing ended Jan. 18 when Dunleavy, forward Troy Murphy and Ike Diogu and guard Keith McLeod were dealt to Indiana for forward Al Harrington, swingman Stephen Jackson, forward Josh Powell and guard Sarunas Jasikevicius. Dunleavy, whose San Francisco crib is already up for sale, couldn’t be happier. The 6-foot-9, 230-pounder averaged 12.7 points, five rebounds and four assists in his first three games with Indiana, numbers slightly better than he had at Golden State this season. He said he never asked Golden State to trade him.\n\n“I always had a feeling that I needed to be moved. It was a big relief,” Dunleavy said.\n\nAnother team interested in Dunleavy was the Clippers, who are coached by his father, Mike Dunleavy Sr. Rumors still persist about a potential exchange for Clippers swingman Corey Maggette. But if you thought the pressure of playing in Golden State was tough, imagine what it would be like playing for Pops. Junior feels such a situation could be “shaky.”\n\n“It’s not so much the pressure,” Dunleavy Jr. said. “It just can be an awkward situation. Here I have a fresh start. Normal. Just one of the guys on the team. It’s a clean slate.\n\n“If I played for my dad it’s a whole different realm. It’s a new team. But how do you deal with relationships with teammates? There is a lot of different variables.”\n\nAfter a tumultuous tenure in Oakland, Dunleavy is now in bliss in Indianapolis.\n\nThe slender swingman is not playing out of position at power forward anymore. The draft is old news there. And with a huge need in Indiana for clean-cut guys without a rap sheet, he is exactly what the Pacers needed. The booing? It won’t return until he is in tough Oakland again.\n\n“I honestly tried my best. It didn’t work out. It’s best for me and the Warriors,” he said.\n\nFootnotes\n\nThe Boston Celtics are the front-runner to land Memphis center Pau Gasol. The Celtics are dangling talented young forward Al Jefferson and several draft picks. Memphis is desperately trying to cut costs. … Word is that the formula to land swingman Maggette via trade is a decent veteran, a good young player and a future first-round pick. … BDA Sports vice president of marketing Bill Sanders laughed at the rumor that Houston Rockets all-star center Yao Ming, one of his company’s clients, was dating actress Nia Long. “If he is dating Nia Long, then I’m dating Paris Hilton,” Sanders said. … Nuggets forward Carmelo Anthony’s fiancée, La La Vasquez, said last week that her pregnancy was going well and that her baby boy was on schedule to be born soon after NBA All-Star Weekend in Las Vegas in February. … One NBA agent said rumblings that Ohio State center Greg Oden is seriously considering staying in school are getting louder. Once Oden decides to go pro, expect him to be represented by his AAU coach and former Olympic champion Mike Conley. Conley also is rumored to likely represent Duke sophomore forward Josh McRoberts if he leaves school early. … Former Colorado forward Chris Copeland recently was signed by Fort Worth of the NBADL. … One NBA draft prospect sleeper to watch is Virginia State’s Avis Wyatt, a 6-11, 230-pound senior center.\n\nMARC J. SPEARS’ NBA MIDSEASON AWARDS\n\nMOST VALUABLE PLAYER\n\nLos Angeles Lakers guard Kobe Bryant\n\nComment: Bryant has led the Lakers to a winning record with the team’s only other upper-echelon player, Lamar Odom, out with an injury. He also is making his teammates better. Washington’s Gilbert Arenas, Dallas’ Dirk Nowitzki and Phoenix’s Steve Nash deserve mention.\n\nCOACH\n\nPhil Jackson, Los Angeles Lakers\n\nComment: No Michael Jordan and Scottie Pippen. No Shaq and Kobe. It’s just Kobe and role players, and Jackson has the Lakers winning. Dallas’ Avery Johnson, Denver’s George Karl and Phoenix’s Mike D’Antoni deserve mention.\n\nMOST IMPROVED PLAYER\n\nSacramento Kings guard Kevin Martin\n\nComment: Martin has nearly doubled his scoring average to 20.5 per game through Friday and has nicely filled Bonzi Wells’ shoes as a scoring threat. The Lakers’ Luke Walton, Denver’s J.R. Smith and Utah’s Carlos Boozer deserve mention.\n\nDEFENSIVE PLAYER\n\nNuggets center Marcus Camby\n\nComment: Camby was second in the NBA in defensive rebounds per game (9.8) through Friday, was third in blocked shots per game (2.9) and second in rebounds per 48 minutes (18.2). Without him, Denver isn’t a playoff team. Charlotte’s Emeka Okafor, Phoenix’s Shawn Marion and Minnesota’s Kevin Garnett deserve mention.\n\nSIXTH MAN\n\nChicago Bulls guard Ben Gordon\n\nComment: Gordon is averaging a team-best 21.3 points off the bench. Only one sixth man, Milwaukee’s Ricky Pierce in 1989-90, has led his team in scoring. Phoenix guard Leandro Barbosa was also considered.\n\nROOKIE\n\nPortland Trail Blazers guard Brandon Roy\n\nComment: Even with an early-season injury, Roy has locked down the award in a weak rookie class. The former University of Washington star plays like a veteran and is averaging 14.3 points, 4.3 rebounds and 2.9 assists through Friday’s games.\n\nSPOTLIGHT ON … NUGGETS CENTER MARCUS CAMBY\n\nBackground: The 11-year NBA veteran has never been an all-star. Missing 16 games before Western Conference coaches voted for reserves last season likely cost the 6-foot-11, 235-pounder an all-star roster spot despite solid statistics. He finished last season averaging 12.8 points, career-highs of 11.9 rebounds and 1.4 steals per game and led the NBA with 3.29 blocked shots per game. “I broke my finger and missed an extended period of time,” Camby said. “I’ve seen other guys make it with injuries.”\n\nWhat’s up: Camby is the West’s most deserving true center candidate. He is averaging 12.3 points, an NBA-leading 12.5 rebounds, ranked third in blocked shots per game (2.9) and also averaged 2.9 assists. If the NBA goes with a true center to replace Houston’s Yao Ming, who was voted in by the fans, Camby’s biggest competition will be Phoenix’s Amare Stoudemire while Utah’s Mehmet Okur is a dark horse. Stoudemire is averaging 18.7 points, 9.1 rebounds and ranked third in the NBA in field-goal percentage (.605). While talented, Stoudemire’s offensive numbers are strongly aided by two-time MVP guard Steve Nash. Camby ranks 14th in NBA efficiency rating (23.53) while Stoudemire is 21st (22.1).\n\n“I would love to make the (West all-star) team,” Camby said. “But I’m not going to cross my fingers and be let down.”\n\nWhat’s next: NBA commissioner David Stern will pick Yao’s replacement. Western Conference coaches will pick seven West all-star reserves who will be announced Thursday. Camby will be hurt by tough competition from a long list of deserving forwards, including Denver’s Carmelo Anthony, Dallas’ Dirk Nowitzki, Utah’s Carlos Boozer, Phoenix’s Shawn Marion, Dallas’ Josh Howard and the Los Angeles Clippers’ Elton Brand. Could Denver have three all-stars in a likely addition of guard Allen Iverson, Anthony and Camby? Iverson and Anthony strongly overshadow Camby in popularity and media attention.\n\n“They are great players that will be on the team,” Camby said about Iverson and Anthony. “I get overshadowed a lot.”\n\nSpears’ take: Camby flat out deserves to be there. If the West coaches truly weigh the statistics and importance to the team, he will be there. Camby played a key role in the Nuggets staying afloat during Anthony’s 15-game suspension. Unfortunately, politics and a long list of competition in the talented West will hurt him.\n\nCamby: Ewing the best\n\nNuggets forward Marcus Camby has played with numerous superstars during his 11-year NBA career. Camby lists Patrick Ewing as the best and declined to rank his other four favorites.\n\n* Carmelo Anthony\n\n* Patrick Ewing\n\n* Allan Houston\n\n* Allen Iverson\n\n* Latrell Sprewell"
