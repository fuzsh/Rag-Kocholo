        "text": "The Golden State Warriors are dedicated to keeping Steph Curry in their uniform for the rest of his career. This, according to General Manager Mike Dunleavy Jr. Despite a challenging offseason, the team is committed to building around their star player and ensuring his legacy as a Warrior.\n\nSteph Curry, a 2x MVP and 10x All-Star, has been the driving force behind the Warriors’ success, transforming them into a modern-day dynasty. With two years and $114 million left on his contract, the Baby Faced Assassin is expected to sign an extension that will keep him with the Warriors for the remainder of his career, for life.\n\nThat guy can get whatever he wants. I think that stuff will get figured out and he’ll be a Warrior for life. Mike Dunleavy Jr. via Anthony Slater\n\nThe Warriors face a tough road ahead, having finished 10th in the West last season and breaking up with Klay Thompson. However, with Curry, Draymond Green , Andrew Wiggins , and Coach Steve Kerr , the team has a strong foundation to build upon.\n\nDunleavy Jr.’s commitment to keeping Curry in a Warriors uniform is a testament to the player’s enduring legacy and importance to the franchise. As the Warriors look to rebuild and return to title contention, Curry remains the cornerstone of their success.\n\nWarriors’ Steph Curry is the only untouchable player in trade talks, says coach Steve Kerr\n\nGolden State Warriors coach, Steve Kerr revealed on the Willard & Dibs show that Step Curry is the only player on the team who is not being considered in trade discussions. Kerr noted that while most players in the league are subject to trade talks, Curry is an exception, along with a few other elite players like LeBron James .\n\nThere's very few players in the league who are not talked about in trade discussions. Steph Curry is not being talked about in trade talks. Everybody else is. Steve Kerr on the Willard & Dibs show\n\nThe implication is that other Warriors players, such as Draymond Green, Andrew Wiggins, and Jonathan Kuminga , could be traded if the right deal comes along. While the team is not actively shopping them, they are looking to maximize Curry’s remaining years by surrounding him with the best possible talent.\n\nThe Warriors have been linked to a potential trade for Lauri Markkanen, who would provide a much-needed offensive boost. However, acquiring him would likely require giving up valuable assets, such as Kuminga or future draft picks. As the Warriors explore trade options, it’s clear that Curry is the one truly untouchable player."
