        "text": "Mike Dunleavy Jr.’s path back to the Golden State Warriors, the franchise that once drafted him, came because of his former agent.\n\nBob Myers represented Dunleavy early in his playing days. They became close friends. Myers joined the Warriors in 2011. He became general manager in 2012. Dunleavy departed the Warriors in 2007 after a turbulent run but finished out a 15-year playing career in 2017, having bounced from Indianapolis to Chicago to Milwaukee to Cleveland to Atlanta.\n\nRight around the time Dunleavy retired, the Warriors’ front office was shifting around Myers. Jerry West left for the Clippers. Travis Schlenk left for the Hawks. Myers felt he needed another trusted voice next to him in a decision-making room that included Joe Lacob, the opinionated majority owner, and Kirk Lacob, his oldest son rising the ranks.\n\nMyers was given the green light to hire Dunleavy, who settled on his next career path quickly. They added him as a pro scout in September 2018 with an expectation that it would eventually become more.\n\n“The one thing he knew he didn’t want to do was coach,” Myers told me then of Dunleavy. “Which is a little bit surprising because I think he’d be a good coach. But he was focused on the front office.”\n\nWith it being announced Friday, Dunleavy is now the Warriors’ next general manager. He is replacing Myers, a franchise legend. Here is a timeline of how Dunleavy got to this point, beginning with a complicated start to his relationship with Golden State.\n\nDrafted in 2002\n\nThe Warriors lost 61 games during the 2001-02 season. So did the Bulls. They tied for the worst record in basketball, giving them equal odds — 22.5 percent — to win the draft lottery. Yao Ming was the prize. The Warriors and their fans, knowing what kind of player and marketing opportunity Yao represented, desperately wanted to win.\n\nThey didn’t. The Rockets, with an 8.9 percent chance, did. They got Yao. The Bulls, drafting second, got Jay Williams. The Warriors, drafting third, got Dunleavy.\n\nHe went on to have a better career than Drew Gooden or Nikoloz Tskitishvili or Dajuan Wagner, the three guys drafted right after him. But Warriors fans weren’t concerned with the alternatives. They saw Yao, an immediate star in Houston, and Dunleavy, a steady role player with an obvious long-term ceiling below the All-Star floor. The team kept losing because of much bigger issues. The organization had more harmful problems.\n\nBut Dunleavy often felt the brunt of the Oracle Arena boos because of that third overall pick label and then the five-year, $44 million price tag — negotiated by Myers’ agency — on his extension. He infamously criticized the fans for the constant booing, ratcheting up the temperature on him.\n\n“Looking back on it, I probably didn’t have the right mindset to be the third pick,” Dunleavy told me when he rejoined the franchise in 2018. “You gotta go out and put up numbers, and I was probably too team-oriented and interested in getting the team better, playing together with my teammates. I probably should’ve been more aggressive, should’ve launched, done all that stuff.”\n\nThe Warriors weren’t awful during Dunleavy’s four-and-a-half seasons. They were just perpetually bad enough to live below the playoff line and continue to disappoint the fan base: 38-44, 37-45, 34-48 and 34-48.\n\nNear the trade deadline of his fifth season, Dunleavy was sent to the Pacers in a deal that brought Stephen Jackson to the Warriors, morphing that team into the “We Believe” run and quickly washing away memories of the Dunleavy era. He stayed in the Eastern Conference for the rest of his career and lived in New York City when the Warriors hired him in 2018. He rejoined a franchise that was a whole lot different from the one he left.\n\n“It really is,” Dunleavy said. “When I was here, I felt pretty confident that we had a strength in two areas. Our two best things were our equipment guy (Eric Housen) and our PR guy (Raymond Ridder). Ironically, those are the two things that have stayed. Everything else has changed and everything else has taken off.”\n\nGO DEEPER\n\nThompson: A toast to the Bay Area's own, Bob Myers\n\nScout in 2018\n\nDunleavy spent much of that first year in the front office attending NBA games in Brooklyn, gathering intel and getting settled into the job. When the college season advanced, the Warriors’ scouting department, led by Larry Harris, deployed him as a college scout in that area of the country.\n\nDunleavy attended Villanova games and practices to watch Eric Paschall. He went to the Big Ten tournament and got an up-close look at three Jordan Poole games. His advice and intel were used on both picks. The Warriors took Poole 28th and Paschall 41st in the 2019 draft.\n\n“At these practices, sometimes you see guys do things they don’t necessarily do in games,” Dunleavy told me in 2019 of Paschall. “So to be able to see some stuff Eric was doing — particularly with the ball in his hands, making plays — made me feel a little bit better about his overall skill level.”\n\nDunleavy became particularly bullish on Poole.\n\n“We had Jordan in for two workouts,” Dunleavy said back then. “Thought he did really well in the first one. Then we brought him back for a second, had him go against some bigger, more physical guys. More two/threes than one/twos. He handled the ball a lot, and his ability to make plays — maybe it was something you don’t see as much in his college environment — was impressive. Then it felt like seeing him, there was some concerns about his physicality holding up in the NBA. He did really well in that workout. That was kind of a moment where everybody felt comfortable saying, ‘You know, this kid, he’s going to be able to hold up.'”\n\nThose two evaluations (delivered back in 2019) give you a quick glimpse into Dunleavy’s ethos as a talent evaluator. He prioritizes skill and playmaking. He was a versatile wing who could do a little bit of everything back in his prime — pass it, shoot it, rebound it, score it in a variety of ways. He has a respected eye and feel for the game. His father was a former NBA head coach and general manager.\n\nThis is what Myers said of Dunleavy after the 2019 playoffs: “He has a great breadth of skill. He can walk up to Steve Kerr and talk about our offense and have a good platform to speak on it. Because he’s played for some great coaches, was a really smart player, his dad was a coach. He does it in a very humble way.\n\n“Even me, I sat with Mike for some playoff games and would ask him: ‘What are you seeing out there?’ I’m not so arrogant to think I know more than he knows about an NBA offense. So I’m just positing questions to him. He takes a deeper look — kind of like Andre (Iguodala) and Shaun (Livingston) — just a brilliant basketball mind. It kind of comes naturally.”\n\nAssistant GM in 2019\n\nKevin Durant, recovering from a recent Achilles tear, was in New York City when free agency started in the summer of 2019. So that’s where Myers had to camp. The Warriors’ chances of retaining Durant were dying, but Myers wanted to be there in person to see it through. He maintained the best relationship in the organization with Durant.\n\nDunleavy lived in New York at the time, so it worked out well. Dunleavy attached himself to Myers for the frantic first few hours of free agency and was in the same Ritz-Carlton room as Myers when the Warriors were able to execute a sign-and-trade with Brooklyn that brought them back D’Angelo Russell, eventually leading to Andrew Wiggins and the pick that became Jonathan Kuminga at the next trade deadline.\n\n“It was crazy. Insane,” Dunleavy told me in 2019. “We’re in a hotel room, pent up. I’m taking tons of notes, pulling Ritz-Carlton pads next to the phone, jotting information down. If I’m on the phone with somebody and he’s on the phone with somebody, I’m writing out notes to him, like, ‘This is what this guy is saying.’ It was strikingly unmodern in the sense that, you know, we had a couple of phones and an iPad, but we weren’t set up that well because the rest of our team was back west.”\n\nAdded Myers: “I remember having my portable charger plugged into my phone because you couldn’t keep the phone charged at all. Multiple conversations going, merging calls, trying to get everyone on the line and in concert on decisions. Different time zones. So much information. Pretty overwhelming.”\n\nAt one point during a quiet moment within the chaos, Myers glanced at Dunleavy and asked a question.\n\n“This is what it is,” Myers said. “Are you sure you want to do this?”\n\nAnd Myers remembered the situation: “I think it was maybe 1 or 2 in the morning. Because at that moment in time, we were deep. It was a scramble. The ground kept shifting. Which happens. That’s just how free agency goes. You’re trying to hold so many different scenarios in your head and mind. It all comes down to your relationships and your trust because none of these things are formalized. But he looked at me with that alacrity in his eyes: Absolutely. I think it drew him more into it than pushed him away.”\n\nVice president of basketball operations in 2021\n\nDunleavy moved from New York back to the Bay Area before the 2019-20 season. He decided to cannonball into the deep end of the job. This is what Myers had hoped for Dunleavy when he targeted him as somewhat of a West/Schlenk replacement. Dunleavy quickly became an elevated voice. He was given the title of vice president of basketball operations in 2021.\n\nOver the last couple of seasons, Dunleavy has absorbed more and more of the daily responsibilities of a general manager, as Myers had ceded a little bit more into the background and spent the last year or more contemplating his future.\n\nDunleavy stood in Myers’ place during the league’s general manager summits. He led meetings and guided on-the-ground initiatives. When the Warriors hired Kenny Atkinson and gave their analytics expert, Pabail Sidhu, more of a voice in the last two seasons, it was Dunleavy who often served as the front-office representative between Atkinson and Sidhu as the Warriors tried to implement more of an analytics approach to the floor.\n\nIt wasn’t difficult to see the direction this was heading. Dunleavy was often the most visible member of the front office during in-season road trips. He’d spend 15 minutes after a shootaround in a long discussion with Kerr or be seen off to the side in conversation with a player.\n\nAfter the Warriors’ Game 1 loss to the Lakers in the second round last month, Dunleavy was spotted in deep conversation in the weight room with Myers, Steph Curry and Draymond Green. It felt like a representative passing-the-torch moment — Myers getting both Dunleavy and the franchise’s leaders ready for the type of challenging conversations they’d need to navigate together once Myers was gone.\n\nThat time is now. Myers announced his departure a couple of weeks ago and endorsed the elevation of Dunleavy in the process. Dunleavy was officially announced as the team’s next general manager on Friday. Joe Lacob will still have a powerful veto vote, like always, and Kirk Lacob is expected to have some level of increased clout, though he already held plenty of weight.\n\nBut it’s Dunleavy stepping into the most prominent front office role right as the Warriors prepare for a monumental offseason.\n\n(Photo of Mike Dunleavy and Jamal Crawford: Jim Poorten / NBAE via Getty Images)"
