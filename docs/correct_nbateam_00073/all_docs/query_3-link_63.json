        "text": "About the Golden State Warriors\n\nThe Golden State Warriors are nearing full strength for the first time since mid-season just as the NBA playoffs are set to begin.\n\nBoth Gary Payton II and Anrew Wiggins are returning to the team for another run at the NBA Finals. The Warriors finished their season in sixth place this year after a topsy turvy season that saw the defending champs put up an underwhelming 44-38 regular season record. This was mostly fueled by their awful road record (11-30).\n\nDespite all this, the Warriorsâ€™ odds to win the NBA Finals have remained steady all season long with few bookmakers willing to write them off entirely, and as of Thursday, you could find them as low as +750 at some books.\n\nThe Warriors will begin their playoff push against the second No. 3 seed Sacramento Kings next week."
