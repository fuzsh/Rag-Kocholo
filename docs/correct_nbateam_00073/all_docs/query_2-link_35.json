        "text": "Mike Dunleavy was comfortable with the three-point shot before the NBA was.\n\nLike all basketball players, especially point guards, launching shots from 23, 25, 27 feet or beyond was something you did even when they counted for two.\n\nDunleavy did it for Nazareth Regional High in Brooklyn in the 1970s, then in college at South Carolina. By that time, every so often, he'd look down and actually see a line.\n\n\"I'd shoot the three-pointer just for fun when we'd go into arenas -- y'know, in college, you'd go someplace like Louisville where they had an ABA team -- and I loved it,\" Dunleavy said.\n\n\"I thought, 'This would be a great thing for me.' \"\n\nAlas, Dunleavy was drafted into the NBA in 1976 -- sixth round, 99th pick overall, by Philadelphia -- and played four seasons before the league adopted the ABA's quirky long-distance rule.\n\nFor another two seasons, he and most other NBA teams shot few three-pointers -- the league average was 166 attempts in Year 2, including all the end-of-quarter heaves that now had a category to fit into.\n\nThen Dunleavy took 15 from out there and made six in Houston's run to the 1981 Finals, and head coach Del Harris liked what he saw.\n\nDunleavy got greenlighted. In 1981-82, he went from 16 3-point attempts the previous season to 86. A year later with San Antonio, the 6-foot-3 reserve took 194 3-pointers and made 67 for 34.5 percent.\n\nThose numbers not only led the NBA across the board in 1982-83 -- Dunleavy took more 3-point shots than 15 entire teams and made more than 19. The Lakers club that went to the Finals that spring attempted 96 and, at 10.4 percent, made only 10; this season's Lakers team, bad as it's been, has had seven games with 10 or more three-point makes.\n\nFast forward 20 years: Michael Joseph Dunleavy Jr. is a rookie for Golden State, the third pick in the 2002 Draft but averaging about 16 minutes off the bench.\n\nHe's putting up one three-point shot every eight minutes or so, a rate similar to his father's in the old man's most prolific season ever. But this Dunleavy ranks fourth on his own team (his 150 is lapped by Jason Richardson's 334).\n\nFive years later, with Indiana in 2007-08, Dunleavy shoots 165-for-389 (42.4) from the arc, posting bigger numbers in a single season than his pop compiled (142-for-419, 33.9 percent) in his entire career.\n\nAny chance that ever comes up at a holiday gathering?\n\n\"Well...,\" Dunleavy Jr. said, picking his words carefully. \"If I bring that up, i think he led the league in percentage a year or two, so relatively speaking, in his era, I guess he was premier. So he can make that argument back.\"\n\nBut Dunleavy Sr. led the league in 3-point accuracy with 34.5 percent. His son has shot better than that in 10 of his 13 NBA seasons without every topping the NBA once.\n\n\"But that was a long shot back then,\" said the younger.\n\nOther 3-point families have been more prolific. For instance, the Currys (Steph and Dell, 2,413-for-5,760 through Sunday) already have surpassed the Barrys (Rick, Brent, Jon and Drew, 2,252-for-5,774) and both are far ahead of the Dunleavys' 1,347-for-3,624. But Mike and Mike bracket the rule and its impact on the NBA nicely, with dad as one of the pioneers of the weapon in this league and son as an ongoing practitioner.\n\nThe 3-point rule predated Dunleavy Jr. by a year; he was born in September 1980, following his father's 3-for-20 work from downtown for Houston. It has been available to him his entire life, from Jesuit High in Portland when the older Dunleavy was coaching the Trail Blazers, at Duke (179-for-483, 37.1 percent in three seasons) and throughout his NBA career.\n\nFactor in his bloodline and no one should be surprised by Dunleavy's reliance on the shot as a pro.\n\n\"He always stressed shooting,\" Dunleavy Jr. said. \"His point was, 'Any team can always use a shooter.' Especially someone who can knock down 3-point shots. Maybe in the early '80s it was a luxury. But as the game evolved, it's become almost a necessity. Everybody's conscious of it, everybody spaces around it. And it's just become revolutionary.\"\n\nReliance on the shot has been explosive. In that inaugural 1979-80 season, the average NBA team used the novelty/desperation shot 227 times, about 3.1 percent of its 7,433 field-goal attempts.\n\nBy Dunleavy Jr.'s rookie season, the averages were 1,204 of 6,624, an 18.2 percent share. And by last season, teams were taking 25.9 percent of their shots from 3-point range, averaging 1,766 attempts. That's an increase of 47 percent from 2002-03.\n\n\"There are a lot of purists who argue it's ruined the game,\" the Chicago Bulls' small forward said. \"I think it gives for a better flow and makes it more beautiful to watch. Spaces the floor better, makes for more movement. If you think about it, without a 3-point line, everybody's just packing the paint. It's going to be harder to get to the basket.\n\n\"I think people understand nothing is or will ever be more valuable than scoring in the paint. But with that 3-point line there, it's like a magnet for defenses. It draws defenses away from the basket a little bit and provides for more space.\"\n\nDunleavy Jr.'s game has moved with the trend. As recently as 2006-07, split between Golden State and Indiana, he took just 26.3 percent of his shots from 3-point range. But for the past seven years, he has bumped that up to 45.2 percent, including 54.9 for the Bulls this season (241 3-point attempts among his 439 shots).\n\n\"It's recognizing the value of it,\" he said. \"I'm a lot less inclined to take 2-pointers. Offensively, with the guys I'm on the floor with, it's my role to keep the floor spaced. A lot of times I find myself outside the 3-point line and when my shot's there, I'll take it.\"\n\nChicago coach Tom Thibodeau, more than ever, is fine with that. The Bulls ranked 29th and 28th in attempted 3s the previous two seasons but are 16th this season while trusting Dunleavy, Nikola Mirotic, Aaron Brooks, Tony Snell andJimmy Butler more with the shot. When healthy, Derrick Rose has taken to hoisting them too, nearly a third of the time (251-for-776 shots overall) while making only 28.7 percent.\n\nThibodeau values Dunleavy for his work without the ball and his movement that triggers opportunities for the offense. Still rail thin at 34, the 6-foot-9 forward doesn't think of himself as a specialist but isn't about to deny his strength as a shooter.\n\n\"It makes sense to me that I've shot more threes, percentage-wise, and I think it will continue to trend that way,\" Dunleavy said. \"Not so much because I'm old and I can't move but because open threes are great shots.\"\n\nHis father has been wise to that for years. When he worked with Milwaukee as an assistant coach to Harris, they urged center Jack Sikma -- a star in Seattle with a strong mid-range game -- to venture farther outside. Overnight, Sikma went from 68 3-point attempts in his first 11 NBA seasons to 216 for the Bucks in 1988-89.\n\nWhen Dunleavy Sr. was hired as Lakers head coach in 1990, he took Sam Perkins from 28 3-point attempts the previous season to 64, climbing the ladder till Perkins transformed his game and shot 363 3-pointers en route to the Finals with Seattle in 1995-96.\n\nThe coach had played HORSE with both bigs and lit up when he saw the potential for some prototype stretch-fours. Said Dunleavy Sr.: \"I talked them into it, telling them 'You guys are great shooters. You can make this. You take the ball out, you're in trailer position coming down the court, we can just kick it back to you and you'd have all the time in the world to shoot this thing.' Both guys had shots but they had to wind it up.\"\n\nAs one might expect, the father likes the three-pointer's effect on the game he played, coached and now watches in between talk-show stints on SiriusXM's NBA Radio.\n\n\"I love it,\" Dunleavy Sr. said. \"You've got the spacing. You've got a good combination of inside-out. If you've got that major post-up guy and you can surround him with guys who can put the ball in the bucket from range, you've got yourself a potent offense.\"\n\nAs coach, Dunleavy also had some unofficial fun with the long ball. He incorporated it into his system of fines -- for instance, if a player was late to practice, the fine was $500 for the first minute and $20 for each minute after that. Then he would give the tardy player a chance to shoot a 3-pointer for double-or-nothing. Or if they preferred, they could challenge him to shoot it, owing nothing if he missed.\n\nEither oblivious to their coach's NBA career or forgetting that his percentages were watered down by end-of-quarter prayers, many chose the latter.\n\n\"I did it 35 times,\" Dunleavy Sr. said. \"I was 32-3.\"\n\nAfter a while, he even gave some players the choice to let him be their proxy, shooting on their behalf to erase the fine. \"They were like, 'what?' \" he said. \"I told them, 'Right, I will shoot it for you.' They thought I'd miss on purpose but I told them I never missed a shot on purpose in my life and I wouldn't start now.\n\n\"Only one guy picked me. It was Olden Polynice. And I made it for him.\""
