        "text": "The Golden State Warriors dynasty was formed by slowly integrating young draft picks, Steph Curry, Klay Thompson, and Draymond Green into the system. Vern Glenn of KPIX in San Francisco joins Charlie Walter to talk about how the Warriors made the wise decision of letting everything play out and why that may be the smart decision in the present day, too.\n\nSteph Curry seems to not be aging, but someday soon the Golden State Warriors will need to find their next face of the franchise. Amy Lawrence of the national radio program \"After Hours With Amy Lawrence\" discusses the subject with Charlie Walter, and gives her next cornerstone player prediction that is sure to shock, but excite Warriors fans.\n\nThe Steph Curry era of the Golden State Warriors could be nearing the last few seasons, and many Warriors fans wonder how aggressive Joe Lacob will be in trying to send Steph out with his 5th championship. Lacob made an appearance on the Hoops Adjacent Podcast and said that he WILL NOT mortgage Golden State's future, citing that the trade market is filled with illogical wants and can be the most dangerous way to try and improve your situation. Kylen Mills and Charlie Walter break down Lacob's comments and discuss whether they agree with Lacob saying this year's team will be better than the '23-'24 installment.\n\nFollowing an all-rookie team performance in his rookie season, Golden State Warriors Guard Brandin Podziemski looks to take his game to that of one of a rising star in the NBA. Charlie Walter and Dan Devone discuss his ceiling.\n\nReports have surfaced detailing the Golden State Warriors offer on the table to Utah, and the Jazz' wish list they would need to trade Lauri Markkanen. Is there a way to get the deal done, and would you entertain the offer? Charlie Walter breaks down why the best option could be to stay put.\n\nThe Golden State Warriors will be in win now mode for as long as Steph Curry is playing, but could they take the approach of waiting for their trade bait pieces to improve their stock and shop around for disgruntled stars at the deadline? Charlie Walter and CBS Bay Area Executive Sports Producer Brian Dea weigh the pros and cons of attacking the trade market now or kicking the can down the road."
