        "text": "The Golden State Warriors are hiring former NBA veteran Mike Dunleavy Jr. to become the team's general manager, the team announced Friday.\n\nDunleavy will replace former president and GM Bob Myers, who stepped down from his role this spring after leading the Warriors through their dynasty run. Dunleavy was previously the team's vice president of basketball operations.\n\n\"We think Mike is the perfect fit to lead our basketball operations department,\" said Warriors co-executive chairman and CEO Joe Lacob.\n\nThe son of former player, coach, and executive Mike Dunleavy Sr., the younger Dunleavy played 15 seasons in the NBA after being picked No. 3 overall out of Duke. He spent his first four-and-a-half years in Golden State.\n\nAfter starting his post-playing career as a scout with Golden State, Dunleavy has quickly risen through the team's front office. He'll now be tasked with stabilizing a Warriors team with a reported divide between their older championship core and the young players the team has brought on in recent seasons.\n\nForward Draymond Green could be an impending free agent should he decline his player option, while Golden State is faced with a mammoth luxury tax bill that's set to be penalized more heavily in the new collective bargaining agreement."
