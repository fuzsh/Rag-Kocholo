        "text": "A professional basketball team based in San Francisco, California, the Golden State Warriors play in the Western Conference of the National Basketball Association (NBA). They have won six NBA championships (1956, 1975, 2015, 2017, 2018, and 2022) and one Basketball Association of America (BAA) title (1947).\n\nThe Warriors were founded in 1946 and originally based in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. An original member of the BAA, the team won the league’s first championship behind the play of future Hall of Fame forward Joe Fulks. In 1949 the Warriors became a part of the NBA when the BAA merged with the National Basketball League (NBL). The team finished higher than fourth place in its division just once in its first six seasons in the new league. In 1955–56, however, the Warriors, led by forward Paul Arizin and center Neil Johnston, posted the best record in the league and captured their first NBA title.\n\nIn 1959 Philadelphia added Wilt Chamberlain, who would go on to become one of the greatest players in NBA history. While with the Warriors, he famously scored an NBA-record 100 points in a 1962 game. A group of San Francisco Bay–area investors purchased the franchise after the 1961–62 season and moved the team, which became known as the San Francisco Warriors. The Warriors reached the NBA finals in 1964 with a team dominated by Chamberlain but lost a five-game series to the Boston Celtics. In the middle of the 1964–65 season the Warriors traded Chamberlain to the Philadelphia 76ers. In 1967, with a substantially rebuilt squad that featured forward Rick Barry, center Nate Thurmond, and guard-forward Jeff Mullins, the Warriors returned to the NBA finals. The Warriors lost again, this time falling to the 76ers in six games.\n\nFormer Warriors player Al Attles took over as the team’s head coach during the 1969–70 season. He went on to lead the franchise for all or part of 14 seasons. In 1971 the franchise—which had been struggling financially—moved across San Francisco Bay to Oakland and changed its name to the Golden State Warriors. In 1974–75 the Warriors, led by Barry, upset the Washington Bullets in the NBA finals. The Warriors returned to the playoffs in each of the following two years. Later, however, their level of play steeply declined. They finished last in their division in five of the nine seasons between 1977–78 and 1985–86.\n\nIn the late 1980s the Warriors became known for head coach Don Nelson’s up-tempo style, which relied on smaller players and an emphasis on scoring over defense. While Nelson’s teams were entertaining, they failed to advance past the second round in the playoffs over this period. Nelson left the Warriors during the 1994–95 season. Golden State then entered into a period that saw them post last- and second-to-last-place finishes in every season but one from 1994–95 to 2005–06. Nelson returned to the Warriors in 2006–07, and that season the team made its first trip to the playoffs in 13 years. The Warriors then made NBA history by becoming the first eighth-seeded (lowest-seeded) team to defeat a top-seeded team in a seven-game postseason series. They eliminated the Dallas Mavericks in the first round of the playoffs. Golden State followed that remarkable campaign by missing the playoffs in three straight seasons, and Nelson was forced to resign in 2010.\n\nLed by young star guard Stephen Curry, the Warriors returned to the postseason in 2012–13. The team brought in a new head coach, Steve Kerr, before the 2014–15 season, and the Warriors quickly turned into a juggernaut. They racked up a franchise-record 67 wins that season and advanced to the NBA finals for the first time in 40 years. The Warriors defeated the Cleveland Cavaliers in a six-game series to capture their third NBA title.\n\nThe following season saw the Warriors make NBA history by winning an astounding 73 games to just 9 losses during the regular season. They broke the previous record of 72 wins that had been set by the 1995–96 Chicago Bulls. The Warriors faced a relative struggle in the Western Conference playoffs. They lost at least one game in each series—which included Golden State overcoming a 3–1 series deficit to the Oklahoma City Thunder in the conference finals—en route to making a return to the NBA finals. There, the Warriors were on the other end of a 3–1 series comeback, as the Cavaliers stormed their way to three straight victories to win the teams’ finals rematch.\n\nThe Warriors added star forward Kevin Durant to their roster before the beginning of the 2016–17 season. The team won a league-best 67 regular-season games that year and made history in the postseason by setting an NBA record for most consecutive wins to open the playoffs (12). The Warriors again faced Cleveland in the NBA finals, where they defeated the Cavaliers in five games. The Warriors continued their dominance in 2017–18. The team claimed its fourth consecutive Western Conference championship by defeating the Houston Rockets in a seven-game series. The Warriors then swept the Cavaliers in four games to capture their third NBA title in four seasons.\n\nThe Warriors won 57 regular-season games in 2018–19, the best record in the Western Conference. During much of the playoffs, Golden State was forced to play without Durant, who suffered a calf strain in the second round. The Warriors, nevertheless, advanced to their fifth straight NBA finals, where they faced the Toronto Raptors. The Raptors took a 3–1 lead in the series before Durant returned to play in game five. Although Golden State won that game, the team again lost Durant to injury when he ruptured his Achilles tendon. The Raptors then eliminated the Warriors in game six."
