        "text": "Even though the Golden State Warriors didn't make any major moves at the trade deadline, it doesn't mean that Warriors GM Mike Dunleavy Jr. thinks the team is perfect. In fact, he's very aware that the team hasn't been playing like a champion.\n\nDuring a Zoom call with reporters on Thursday, Dunleavy Jr. shared a very candid expectation about the Warriors' championship odds this season.\n\n\"Well, we don't have a championship record at this point,\" Dunleavy said. \"So that's the challenge: To get ourselves into the mix and get ourselves into the Play-In is the most important thing. We have championship experience. We have guys that have been there and can do it. I think we're capable. Unfortunately, we just haven't played to that level to this point of the season.\"\n\nIt's a harsh realization that the Warriors aren't even really looking at a solid playoff spot anymore this season, but just a Play-in spot. Even then, they're still on the outside looking for a Play-in tournament spot. What Dunleavy Jr. thinks will help Golden State is being able to play better defense.\n\n\"My biggest concern defensively frankly is our ability to stop the ball, protect the basket,\" Dunleavy said. \"We looked at things that would help with that, but I think if everyone plays to their maximum ability, I think we're there with any team in the league. I think we've shown that this year with the games we've been in. Unfortunately, we haven't been able to win those games in a lot of cases.\"\n\nThe time is now or never for the Golden State Warriors. The fans know it, Mike Dunleavy Jr. knows it, and the team knows it.\n\n\"But the train's moving out of the station right now and we got to get this thing going. I think everybody feels a sense of urgency.\"\n\nKlay Thompson Shares Strong Message Amid Contract Rumors\n\nSteve Kerr Reacts to Warriors Receiving Zero Championship Votes in GM Survey"
