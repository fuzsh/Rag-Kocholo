        "text": "Cleveland Cavaliers big man Evan Mobley has agreed to a five-year, $224million maximum rookie contract extension that could become worth as much as $269million based on incentives, agents Joe Smith and Thad Foucher of Wasserman told ESPN on Saturday.\n\nSince entering the league as the third overall pick in the 2021 NBA Draft, Mobley has emerged as one of the NBA's premier defensive players. He finished third in Defensive Player of the Year voting in 2023 and was also named first-team All-Defense that year.\n\nMobley, 23, averaged 15.7 points, 9.4 rebounds and 1.4 blocks last season, while also notching career-high shooting percentages of 57.9 overall, 37.3 from 3-point range and 71.9 from the free throw line.\n\nHe is one of just four players to have at least 300 blocks and 150 steals over the past three seasons. The others are Anthony Davis, Rudy Gobert and Jaren Jackson Jr.\n\nMobley was likely headed for his second straight all-defense selection, but an early-season knee injury limited him to 50 regular-season games in 2023-24.\n\nOver his 198 career games, Mobley has averaged 15.6 points on 54.4% shooting to go with 8.8 rebounds, 2.8 assists and 1.5 blocks.\n\nHe had arguably his best game as a pro in Cleveland's final game of the 2024 playoffs when he tallied 33 points, seven rebounds and two blocks in 43 minutes in a Game 5 loss to the eventual champion Boston Celtics.\n\nThe Cavaliers hired Kenny Atkinson to replace J.B. Bickerstaff as head coach earlier this offseason and signed star guard Donovan Mitchell to a three-year, $150.3million max extension.\n\nCleveland Cavaliers big man Evan Mobley has agreed to a five-year, $224 million maximum rookie contract extension that could become worth as much as $269 million based on incentives, agents Joe Smith and Thad Foucher of Wasserman told ESPN on Saturday.\n\nSince entering the league as the third overall pick in the 2021 NBA Draft, Mobley has emerged as one of the NBA’s premier defensive players.

Bickerstaff as head coach earlier this offseason and signed star guard Donovan Mitchell to a three-year, $150.3 million max extension.\n\nSharpshooting Bahamian Buddy Hield expressed excitement at the opportunity to play for the Golden State Warriors in his first interaction with Warriors media on Thursday.\n\nThe 31-year-old joined the seven-time NBA Champions through a sign-and-trade with the Philadelphia 76ers in early July.\n\nThe Warriors will be the fifth team Hield has represented since being drafted sixth overall by the New Orleans Pelicans in the 2016 NBA Draft.\n\n“Excited! Excited for the opportunity to come in here and learn from great players, a great organization, great coach, and be a sponge and an open book to everybody around me,” was Hield’s response to a question about his emotions heading into his first season in San Francisco.\n\nHield was brought in by the Warriors as a like-for-like replacement for franchise legend Klay Thompson who left for the Dallas Mavericks in Free Agency after 13 seasons and four titles with the Warriors.\n\nThe Bahamian says he isn’t feeling the pressure of trying to replicate what Thompson gave the Warriors.\n\n“There’s no pressure, I just have to come and do my job. What Klay has done for this organization has been tremendous. I love Klay a lot and I watched him over the years and he’s special,” he said.\n\n“The way he can get hot and change the game as a two-way player. I think it’s fun being in that role,” he added.\n\nOne of the hallmarks of the Warriors during their run of dominance in the Steph Curry-Draymond Green-Klay Thompson era has been their complicated offensive scheme.\n\nHield believes practice is the key to learning where he fits into the offense quickly.\n\n“Taking it day by day in practice, watching a lot of film. Practice will be really important. I’ve watched these guys play since college. Even in the pros when they play, they’re always a fun team to watch,” he said.\n\n“I think it’s a great fit and it shouldn’t be that hard but everything takes time,” he added."
