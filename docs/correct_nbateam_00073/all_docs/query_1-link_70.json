        "text": "He waited and waited on draft night, but Trayce Jackson-Davis ended up in a good place with a good deal when it was all said and done.\n\nThe former IU basketball star is getting a four-year deal from the Golden State Warriors, the first two guaranteed, according to ESPN’s Adrian Wojnarowski.\n\nJackson-Davis was the 57th pick in last month’s NBA Draft, though some mock drafts considered him a late first-round selection.\n\nPart of the reason for the fall to the second to last pick in the draft? Jackson-Davis told teams he didn’t want to sign a two-way contract that would lead to him playing significant time in the G-League. He avoided that arrangement and is expected to be on the Warriors 15-man roster when NBA play begins in October.\n\nJackson-Davis’ deal is more like a late first round arrangement.\n\nAll first-round picks in the NBA are given four-year deals with two years of guaranteed money. But those rules do not apply to second-round selections. Teams can sign second-round picks to whatever amount they choose and don’t have to guarantee any seasons.\n\nThat’s a good indication Golden State is sold on Jackson-Davis’ potential. Interestingly, new Golden State general manager Mike Dunleavy Jr.’s brother, James, is Jackson-Davis’ agent.\n\nJackson-Davis is with the Warriors for the NBA Summer League, but he’s missed their first two games with a hamstring injury.\n\nThe Greenwood, Ind. product finished his IU career as the program leader in rebounds (1,143) and blocks (270). He averaged 20.9 points and 10.8 rebounds per game during his consensus first team All-American senior season in 2022-23 while shooting 58.1 percent from the field.\n\nThe Daily Hoosier –“Where Indiana fans assemble when they’re not at Assembly”"
