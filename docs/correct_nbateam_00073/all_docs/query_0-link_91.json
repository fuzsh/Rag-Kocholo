        "text": "Golden State Warriors general manager Mike Dunleavy Jr. held a press conference on Monday to discuss the current state of the team ahead of Wednesday’s NBA Draft. From Klay Thompson’s contract negotiations to the possibility of making a trade, Dunleavy touched on several of the biggest news topics surrounding the team this offseason.\n\nOne of the more interesting answers from Dunleavy was his response to potentially making a trade. While he started his presser saying that “all options are on the table”, he continually emphasized the importance of internal development."
