        "text": "The first big move by the Golden State Warriors this offseason was shipping off the ever-so-reckless Jordan Poole in exchange for one of the most calming presences on the basketball court, Chris Paul.\n\nFirst-year general manager Mike Dunleavy Jr.'s decision to trade away a 24-year-old who has riveting offensive potential for a 38-year-old aging star solidifies the organization's commitment to Stephen Curry's timeline.\n\n\"We sensed we needed a shift,\" head coach Steve Kerr told The Athletic's Tim Kawakami. \"And it feels like we made a pretty significant shift without giving up our identity and our sense of who we are as a team.\"\n\nThe departure of Poole along with the re-signing of Draymond Green (four years, $100 million) signals an end to owner Joe Lacob's infamous two-timeline plan.\n\nThroughout Golden State's dynastic era, turnovers have haunted the franchise, and last season it became an insurmountable feat. Poole (No. 4 — 252) and Draymond Green (No. 15 — 204) both ranked among the top 15 in total turnovers last season. As a team, Golden State averaged the second-most turnovers per game (16), only trailing the Houston Rockets.\n\nPaul and former Detroit Piston point guard Cory Joseph — who signed a one-year deal — were two of the best facilitators while taking care of the basketball last season. CP3 was No. 4 last season in assist-to-turnover ratio at 4.8, and Joseph was No. 9 (3.9).\n\nThe Athletic's Anthony Slater stated that Joseph \"profiles as an unspectacular but reliable fourth guard who can shoulder an added minutes burden on some nights. That will prove useful.\"\n\nGolden State has gotten smarter, and these two near guards will give Kerr far fewer headaches.\n\nThe Warriors have tried to quickly retool this roster into a smarter and more consistent group than last season.\n\nHowever, there's still one glaring hole that must be addressed. With the resurgence of the big men across the league, The Warriors roster falls short of providing an adequate matchup. They're still without a player taller than 6-foot-9. It's a problem that must be solved before opening night."
