        "text": "Mike Dunleavy Jr. is the bridge. He’s trying to prolong the last days of the Warriors’ plausible dynastic run, he’ll manage the necessary franchise transition into something else and, if all goes reasonably well, he’ll preside over whatever lasting thing comes next.\n\nThat’s his responsibility. The holding on. The deciding when it’s over. The scary step to the next era. And the way it’s going, all of this — the emergency maintenance, then the remaking — might happen over one very hectic and fateful calendar year.\n\nNone of this is too much of a surprise, of course. The Warriors have won four titles in this era and that number very well might not get to five. There is a lifespan for even the greatest runs. And Dunleavy took over the general manager’s role last summer from Bob Myers with all realistic expectations, having already spent several seasons in the front office and in all the big meetings grappling with the NBA actuarial table.\n\nDunleavy and everybody in Warriors management want to extend this run at least through this season, but so far, with Draymond Green’s suspension time piling up and other mainstays faltering, that doesn’t look especially likely. And if things don’t turn around pretty soon — 15 to 20 games, Dunleavy suggested to reporters on Thursday — it could be time to make some serious recalibrations.\n\nBut first, Dunleavy’s mandate is to make sure the Warriors get every last shot at it with Stephen Curry still at the top of his game and still surrounded by most of the core group that helped this team to a championship in June 2022. The Warriors aren’t walking away from that hope until they realistically can’t hope it anymore.\n\nMike, do you believe this team as currently constructed still has a chance to win a title?\n\n“Yeah, I do; I do believe this whole roster does, as the way it was designed,” Dunleavy said on my podcast before Thursday’s loss in L.A. to the Clippers to drop the Warriors to 10-14. “We certainly believed that, whatever it was, eight weeks ago, when we started the season. Some things haven’t broken our way. But these things change quickly. We get everybody rowing in the right direction, I think it’s doable.\n\n“But hey, six weeks from now, the (Feb. 8) trade deadline, maybe something comes up that makes more sense and we do something. But this is a group that the core guys have been there are capable of doing it.”\n\nThere is a realism in Dunleavy’s approach, too. There has to be. He didn’t take over a team with a bunch of young superstars. Curry is 35. Draymond is 33 and indefinitely suspended after a recent series of violent acts on the court. Klay Thompson is also 33 and has struggled for most of this season, though he put up a season-high 30 points on Thursday. Chris Paul, the biggest offseason acquisition, is 38.\n\nJoe Lacob and the rest of the Warriors’ ownership group has committed more than $400 million (in salary and pending luxury-tax penalties) to this roster. Which currently sits several games out of even the Play-In spots in the Western Conference. And Dunleavy didn’t bat down the idea that the Warriors’ brass has to contemplate the possibility that this run is just about over. Or might’ve been over a little while ago.\n\n“People were writing about the demise as far back as 2019 when (Kevin Durant) left,” Dunleavy said. “And frankly, they’re batting zero on that. At some point, they’ll be right. But in the meantime, every year since I’ve been here, we’ve evaluated that. Can we still compete at the highest level? We felt we have, and we’ve gone out there and tried to do it. Some years there’s been injuries or things haven’t gone the way we (want).\n\n“But the one thing that remains the same is Joe and the ownership group are always … they’re so competitive, they’re always willing to spend. It’s my job, it’s our front office’s job to give him the best advice and information on whether it’s worth it. And then from there, we’ll make the right decisions and see where we’re at.”\n\nThe practical part is that Draymond will be out for most or all of this crucial period, as Dunleavy, Lacob, Steve Kerr and the other Warriors’ stakeholders (almost certainly including Curry) assess everything. But that’s sort of built into this: Draymond’s actions, despite numerous very clear warnings from the league, have taken him out of the picture for now. Unless Draymond changes his behavior on the court swiftly and dramatically once he’s allowed to return, the Warriors really can’t count on him to avoid future suspensions and ejections, anyway.\n\n“If we can do well without him, I’m confident we can do great with him,” Dunleavy said. “And that’ll be part of the evaluation. And look, it times out pretty well over this next stage. We’re going to have a good idea of where we’re going to be in the standings, in the playoff race as it leads up to the trade deadline. And the trade deadline is probably when you’re going to have your best offers, your best deals available and all that.\n\n“I really don’t think there’ll be any drastic moves in terms of, like, direction. I fully intend for this team to compete … if we make a move, to me it’s going to be for a player that we think can make the team better. And we’ll keep canvassing the league searching for that. Hey, listen, we may play great over the next 10 to 15 games and still make a move, right? If something’s there, we’re going to do it.”\n\nIn other words, the Warriors are not likely headed toward a roster fire-sale at the trade deadline. Practically, other than Curry, there’s just not much on their roster that would attract the kind of monster offers to start a rebuild. And the Warriors aren’t trading Curry, folks. If they’re looking to clear things out, the Warriors can trade Paul, whose 2024-25 contract isn’t guaranteed for next season, so he can be used as an expiring deal for a team looking to slash future costs, but that likely wouldn’t get them much back. They can see what Andrew Wiggins might get on the market, but he just got benched and it’s hard to imagine much value there. They can monitor any trade market for Draymond, but good luck there, since he’s just starting a four-year, $100 million deal while he’s under extreme league scrutiny. Young players like Jonathan Kuminga, Moses Moody and Brandin Podziemski might draw interest, but why would the Warriors trade them away just when they’re starting to mostly plan for the future?\n\nNo, a blow-up by February just doesn’t seem prudent.\n\n“I don’t see that happening right now, especially with the way Steph Curry’s playing,” Dunleavy said. “He’s still at an elite level. He’s proven that he can win championships when you put the right players around him. You know, our payroll, our ownership group, just the competitiveness that we have, I think our main focus is getting into the playoffs. Getting into the tournament. That’s how it’ll be.\n\n“Quote, unquote ‘blowing it up’ is even tough to do during the season, as well. It’s been a little confounding this year just because kind of the additions we made this offseason in the effort we made to strengthen our bench and increase our depth has really worked out well. Unfortunately, our starting lineup, which was so good for a couple years, hasn’t been that way this year. So we’re adjusting now, trying to figure that one out, solve for that. But I still really like our depth and the fact that we have a guy who’s one of the top five guys in the league or so. So those are good things to have. We’ve gotta figure out the rest and be better finishing games, holding leads. Just in those areas, we’ve been right there, just gotta get the results.”\n\nBut again, there’s a lot of realism in those words. The Warriors want to believe they can still compete at the highest levels. They know Curry is ready to joust with anybody, at any time. But Dunleavy and the other Warriors leaders understand that there will be a time when they have to accept that it’s over. Maybe that’ll happen by this offseason. Everybody’s eyes are wide open on this.\n\n“I’d say I was very comfortable and know what I signed up for,” Dunleavy said. “You don’t specifically know what things will come your way, so that’s been a surprise in some ways. But there’s always going to be rocky waters in this. I’ve been around the league to know that. I’m comfortable with it, facing the challenges as they come. We’ve got a great group. Our organization is strong. Our processes are strong. Steve Kerr is our head coach, and we’ve got really, really good players. All in all, it’s in a good place, it’s just figuring a few things out here and we’ll see where we’re at.”\n\nGO DEEPER\n\nWhere do the Warriors go from here? The next 20 games could decide a lot\n\nHere are more highlights from our conversation …\n\n• Dunleavy had conversations with league officials and Draymond and his agents to come up with the indefinite suspension, which includes Draymond agreeing to meet certain criteria before he’s eligible to play again. Dunleavy said all three sides agreed to this.\n\n“I think it’s about helping him, assisting him with this,” Dunleavy said. “The incidents, they’ve been more frequent. I think they’ve been more frequent. And that’s a red flag. I’m not sure how we treat him differently, I think again it’s trying to get him the appropriate help to remedy this and at the same time, when these situations arise, what are the strategies, what are the things he can do, we can do, to not make them go over the top. And I think that’s what we’ll be seeking to look at over the coming weeks and months and frankly something that will just continue throughout his career. I think it’s the right resolution.”\n\nDunleavy wasn’t the GM when Draymond punched Jordan Poole in last season’s training camp then didn’t suspend him for it, but he said it’s fair to judge the way the team has handled Draymond over the years:\n\n“That’s reasonable. We look back on everything, right? You look back on the draft, trades and all those types of things and these decisions as well. I would say again, the punishment is one thing and the main issue here is resolving the issue. And we’ve worked on that. We’ll continue to do so. We can look back on stuff and question it, that’s totally fair. Not sure how we would’ve done it different, but open to criticism and debate on that. But the main thing is we’re here today, what are we doing moving forward, and I think we feel good about that.”\n\n• I asked: Was Draymond’s history of incidents, mostly the Poole punching, considered when you signed him the new deal last summer?\n\n“You take everything into account,” Dunleavy said. “You take age, you take injury history, you take these types of incidents, you take performance on the court, on offense, on defense. We looked at all that. We looked at everything. And unequivocally, having Draymond available for us in the lineup was 100 percent the right thing to do and continue on with as we pursue having great teams and championships and all that. Could we foresee a scenario this season where he will end up, we’ll see what it ends up being, countless games because of league penalties? I think every year Draymond’s good for an ejection or so … or whatever … that’s kind of part of it. But this has gotten a little too far. So we’ve got to try to rein it in and help him. I think you look at it from a positive note: We’re going to turn this into a strength and figure it out.\n\n“We’ll stand by the contract we signed him to. His play on the court certainly warrants that. Just try and clean up this side of things.”\n\nGO DEEPER\n\nThe Warriors should consider exiting the Draymond-vs.-NBA drama\n\n• Dunleavy said he agreed with Kerr that it’s time to make some changes to the Warriors’ starting lineup and rotations. Podziemski started for Wiggins on Thursday, and two nights earlier Klay sat during the closing minutes of a close loss to the Suns.\n\n“It’s certainly been problematic when you’ve got multiple guys that aren’t playing their best at one time, and that’s not just Andrew and Klay, we’ve had some of that throughout,” Dunleavy said. “But you get through 25 games, and if the results aren’t there, you’ve definitely got to look in the mirror and say, ‘What do we have to do to remedy this?’ I think we’re going through that right now.\n\n“But again, the good news is we’ve got a lot of other guys that are playing really well. You never know switching up some rotations and some lineups and some strategy, like, these guys have a track record. They can get back on track. And we need them to because they’ve proven it. It was just 18 months ago that they were at an elite level, winning an NBA championship and helping us to the finals. So it’s there. It’s just a matter of everybody getting it out of each other.”\n\n• Dunleavy on Kuminga, who moved into Draymond’s spot in the starting lineup on Thursday and continued a run of strong play: “He’s really important first and foremost with Draymond out, filling that gap a little bit, just the defense, the stuff around the rim. He fills a positional void. I think for JK, the biggest thing recently is keeping it simple in terms of low-foul, low-turnover. You take care of the ball, you don’t foul, right there you’re looking at being just, like, a level player on the court. Then you take into account the other stuff you have, the talent, the athleticism, all that, you add that in, then you’re going to be an extremely positive player that helps us win. He’s sort of bought into that lately, which has been great. And if he can keep that going, this is a unique player. Guy that can play both sides of the floor and really tie lineups together.”\n\n• Dunleavy on Podziemski, his first-round pick last June and suddenly a guy who could be looking at 30-plus minutes a game: “Yeah, BP’s been really good. I think coming out of college it’s always tough to judge a player defensively, how good they’ll be. Even the guys you think would be elite on ball, sometimes they don’t end up being that. So that’s always the toughest thing to judge. But I think Brandin’s added some strength, he’s really smart, he’s really tough. He’s a guy we trust out there defensively. You can put him on really good offensive players and trust that he’s gonna follow the gameplan, he’s going to move his feet, he’s not gonna foul. And as a rookie that’s a really tough, unique thing. We’ve been really pleased with him, want him to keep growing.\n\n“Moses Moody, same thing. He’s made some real good strides here in Year 3. You mentioned Kuminga before. I really think people can talk a lot about the now and then there’s the future, but I think we’re in a good spot with our young guys and what we have moving forward. It’s just trying to figure out the moment. The good news is we’ve got a lot of players. So it seems doable. So I’m overall pleased with everything except for our record at the moment. And we’ve got to get that straightened out.”\n\n• My colleague Shams Charania has reported that the Warriors had an extension offer of two years, $48 million on the table to Klay before the start of the season, but after Klay didn’t agree to it, the Warriors have pulled the offer and it’s likely headed to this summer, when Klay will be a free agent. Is this true?\n\n“The only thing I’ll say on that is there’s great mutual interest in bringing him back,” Dunleavy said. “We want to make that happen. Not much different than I think it was 2019, when he hit unrestricted free agency and figured that one out. I’m confident we can do it again. But the main thing right now is just getting through the season. He’s had his moments when he’s been really good. I think we all want him to be more consistent. The big thing with Klay that’s so good is he’s so competitive, he wants to win, he’s going to give great effort. And then, even when he’s not making shots, he’s such a threat out there. With his size and shooting ability, obviously, the more shots he can make the better, but just his presence alone is helpful. We value that. We’ll see how this season plays out. But I’ve always been optimistic that we can get him back in the fold.”\n\n• And finally, Dunleavy on the state of negotiations with Kerr, whose contract is also up after this season: “That stuff’s ongoing. Again, I remain optimistic with Steve as well as Klay, that we can get both those guys back. We’ll just have to see. I think everybody right now … just solely focused on the moment, the season, getting us out of this little rut we’re in. Which has been a little strange because for the most part I think we’re playing pretty well. We just haven’t really closed out games, we had a little bit of misstep here, a little misstep there and you look up and we’re three games under .500. Righting the ship is the most important thing right now, but looking ahead to the future, definitely want to get Steve back on board and Klay as well.”\n\n(Top photo of Draymond Green, Stephen Curry and Klay Thompson: Lachlan Cunningham / Getty Images)"
