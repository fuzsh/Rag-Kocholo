        "text": "Given my lifelong fascination with basketball abroad, this was a development I couldn’t resist highlighting: Puerto Rican teams are increasingly luring former NBA players there to continue their careers. I checked in with the foremost expert on tracking such things — HoopsHype’s Alberto de Roa — and promptly learned he has a working list of 20 players with NBA experience who have signed to play in Puerto Rico this season. The most recognizable names among them: Earl Clark, Norris Cole, Ed Davis, Tyreke Evans, Rondae Hollis-Jefferson, Brandon Knight, Greg Monroe, Eric Paschall, Elfrid Payton and Hassan Whiteside.\n\nWolves waive Eric Paschall\n\nMichael Scotto: Sources: The Minnesota Timberwolves have waived forward Eric Paschall, @hoopshype has learned. In three NBA seasons, Paschall has averaged 9.8 points on 49.4 percent shooting."
