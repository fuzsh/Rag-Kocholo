The Golden State Warriors are promoting Mike Dunleavy Jr. to serve as the team’s next general manager, according to ESPN’s Adrian Wojnarowski. Dunleavy will replace Bob Meyers, who recently stepped down from the position after 11 seasons. This comes as the Warriors face a number of pressing questions ahead of what could be a busy offseason for the club.

Wojnarowski reported Dunleavy and Golden State finalized terms on a long-term deal this week, and a formal announcement and press conference is set for Monday. According to Wojnarowski, vice president of basketball operations Kirk Lacob will also be involved in making roster decisions alongside Dunleavy.

Dunleavy has served in several front offices roles with the Warriors after joining the club as a scout in 2018, including assistant general manager to Bob Meyers. As a 15-year NBA veteran, he offers a bevy of player experience to his new role.
