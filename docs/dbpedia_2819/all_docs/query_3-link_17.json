In 1958 she starred opposite Yul Brynner in The Brothers Karamazov.\n\nSchell went on to play many film and TV roles but her later years were marked by declining health, financial difficulties and seclusion.\n\nTwice married\n\nShe made her last public appearance at the 2002 premiere of My Sister Maria, brother Maximilian's documentary of her life and work.\n\nHer two marriages ended in divorce, the last one in 1988 after 22 years with Austrian actor and director Veit Relin.\n\nSchell, who is survived by her two children, is reported to have died on Tuesday at her home in southern Austria, which was also her parents' pre-war home."
