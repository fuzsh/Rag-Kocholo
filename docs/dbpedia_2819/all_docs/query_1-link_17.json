        "text": "Wistful leading lady, in international films from the early 1940s, whose career crested in the 50s. Schell garnered acclaim for her performances in Helmut Kautner's \"The Last Bridge\" (1955), Luchino Visconti's \"White Nights\" (1957) and Alexandre Astruc's \"End of Desire\" (1958). Her appeal quickly diminished with the advance of the 1960s and, following a five year retirement beginning in 1963, she reappeared in a number of character roles. Sister of actor/director Maximilian Schell."
