She attended school in Munich and Hampden, graduating from Hampden High School, before continuing her education at Bottineau College for a short time. On December 23, 1960, she married Michael “Jack” Schell. They made their home in Langdon where they raised their family. Audrey held several jobs in Langdon including hostess/waitress, dental receptionist, and day care for two very special people close to her heart. She enjoyed working at many businesses in Langdon and did every job she had with great passion. Audrey was a member of American Legion Auxiliary and Eagles Auxiliary.\n\nAudrey enjoyed tending to her flowers and yard, word finds, playing cards, having coffee with her closest friends, and, most of all, decorating for every holiday. She looked forward to family holiday gatherings and attending her grandchildren’s events; spending time with family brought her much joy. She also never missed sending cards to friends and family for special occasions.\n\nSurviving Audrey are her children: Sandy Biffert (Jarvis Schmidt) of Hazen, ND, Terry Schell of Grandin, ND, Michael Schell (Sherry Skoglund) of Roseau, MN, and Sheri Beedy (Dennis Gumke) of Jamestown, ND; grandchildren: Kayla (Josh) Smith, Lisa (Jamie) Hams, Racheal Biffert, Lexie Biffert, Logan Biffert, Austin (Lisa) Schell, Abby Schell, Kendra (Jesse) Henke, Kelton Beedy, Dalton Skoglund, and Selina Skoglund; great-grandchildren: Macee, Izabel, Gunner, Jadin, Kenadee, Sage, Drew, Kallie, Emma, Audrey, and Molly; brothers Allen (Mary) Janzen and Dale Janzen; brothers-in-law Don Schell, Gerald (Darlene) Schell, and Harlan (Kaye) Schell; sisters-in-law Rosie Streifel and Diane Schell; and many nieces and nephews. She was preceded in death by her parents, husband Jack, infant daughter, brother Darryl, and mother and father-in-law Eva and Frank Schell.\n\nThe family would like to thank all the staff at Ave Maria Village for the compassionate care Audrey received while a resident there for the past four years.\n\nAny memorials may be sent to Ave Maria Village, 501 19th St. NE, Jamestown, ND 58401-2599.\n\nAn open visitation will be held from 10:00 a.m. to 12:00 p.m. on Tuesday, November 17, 2020, at St. Alphonsus Church in Langdon, ND. Social distancing and masks are highly encouraged. Due to COVID restrictions, a private Mass of Christian Burial will be held at 2:00 p.m. with burial at Calvary Cemetery in Langdon."
