        "text": "In The News\n\nTributes are paid to actor Maximilian Schell\n\nTRIBUTES have been paid to the actor Maximilian Schell who has passed away at the age of 83.\n\nThe Austrian-born actor will be best remembered for his Oscar-winning performance in the 1961 film Judgement At Nuremberg (see below) in which he played the role of a lawyer who was defending a Nazi.\n\nAfter starting out on the stage, the young Schell had appeared in a handful of European films before heading for Hollywood where he landed a role, apparently by mistake, in the 1958 movie The Young Lions opposite Marlon Brando. It was claimed that the producers had wanted to hire his sister, the actress Maria Schell, but had ended up offering Maximilian a role following a glitch in communications.\n\nHis performance as the friend of the German soldier played by Brando paved the way for the part in Judgement At Nuremberg which won him the Academy Award for best actor.\n\nHe went on to forge a successful career in Hollywood, picking-up Oscar nominations for best actor in two more movies — The Man In The Glass Booth (1975) and Julia (1977). His many movie credits over the years included Topkapi (1962), Cross Of Iron (1977) and Deep Impact (1998).\n\nMr. Schell also enjoyed success on the small screen, including a Golden Globe-winning performance on the TV mini series Stalin (1992).\n\nHe also directed several movies including The Pedestrian (1974) which was nominated for an Oscar for Best Foreign Language Film, while a documentary, Marlene (1984), about the life of Marlene Dietrich, was nominated for a Best Documentary Oscar.\n\nIn recent years he had been dividing his time between work in European-based TV and film productions and work in the U.S.\n\nMr. Schell had been filming in Austria when he became ill and was treated in hospital for a lung infection. He was later discharged but fell ill again several days later and passed away at a clinic in Innsbruck.\n\nTo view an excerpt from Judgement At Nuremberg, featuring Maximilian Schell, click here.\n\nView previous In the News items: Actor Eric Lawson passes away, Tributes are paid to Pete Seeger, Slight rise in number of deaths in Northern Ireland, Stargazer John Dobson passes away, Actress Sarah Marshall passes away, Tributes are paid to Sir Christopher Chataway, Tributes are paid to Lord McAlpine, Tributes are paid to Roger Lloyd Pack, Thieves target urn containing ashes of Sigmund Freud, Actress Alexandra Bastedo passes away, Poet Amiri Baraka passes away, Tributes are paid to Paul Goggins, Entertainment mogul Run Run Shaw passes away, Tributes are paid to film producer Saul Zaentz, Local charities hold Christmas appeals, Actress Joan Fontaine passes away, Tributes are paid to screen legend Peter OToole, Tributes are paid to novelist Colin Wilson, Final preparations are made for funeral of Nelson Mandela, Actress Eleanor Parker passes away, Tributes are paid to actor Barry Jackson, Pianist and composer Stan Tracey passes away, National Memorial Service held for Nelson Mandela, Actress Mary Riggans passes away, Tributes are paid to actor Paul Walker, Actress Jean Kent passes away, Tributes are paid to actor Lewis Collins, Leading crossword setter Araucaria passes away, Funeral takes place of Fr Alec Reid, Former Manchester United footballer passes away, Belfast writer is honoured at Westminster Abbey, Tributes are paid to Nobel winning scientist Frederick Sanger, Broadcaster Ray Gosling passes away, Immunologist William Pollack passes away, Oldest person in UK passes away, Tributes are paid to former rugby star Steve Prescott, Hundreds attend the funeral of Eddie McGrady, Hundreds attend funeral of former RAF man, Former broadcaster John Cole passes away, Tributes are paid to pianist Bernard Roberts, Scottish singer Jack Alexander passes away, Jazz musician Frank Wess passes away, Actor Graham Stark passes away, Memorial is unveiled to hero priest, Actress Marcia Wallace passes away, Tributes are paid to Augusto Odone, Tributes are paid to jazzman Tommy Whittle, Singer Noel Harrison passes away, Former US politician Tom Foley passes away, Tributes are paid to actor Kumar Pallana, Character actor Ed Lauter passes away, Chemist Malcolm Renfrew passes away, Campaigner for child proof packaging passes away or Writer Oscar Hijuelos passes away"
