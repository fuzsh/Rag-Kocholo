        "text": "Carl Schell\n\nâ¦ was born on November 14th, 1927 and is an actor, director, life and quick-change artist, adventurer and palm tree expert. His second wife Stella Schell-Monney became a musical star overnight â as Sheila in Hair. Caroline Schell, their daughter, is a renowned sculptor and painter.\n\nMaximilian Schell\n\nâ¦ was born on December 8th, 1930 and died on Febuary 1th, 2014 was one of the few European actors who made an international career. He won an Academy Award for his role in Judgement at Nuremberg and was repeatedly nominated for the Academy Awards thereafter. An actor much in demand in Hollywood, he shot more than 50 movies. On top of all this, he was a renowned movie and theatre director.\n\nHis last big project a movie about Beethoven, being a pianist himself, he wasnât able to complete. Maximilian married, aged 83, the singer Iva, on 20th of August 2013. She is 48 years his junior. Only six month after his weeding my uncle didnât awake from the anaesthesia of an operation any more and said goodbye for good. We have had a close relationship.\n\nImmy Schell\n\nâ¦ was born on February 2nd, 1934, died on August 13th, 1992 and was an actress as well. Careerwise, she didnât quite make it as far as her siblings, but found the love of her life in the actor Walter Kohut. She was my favourite aunt, even more so my friend and left me her enormous Jazz collection."
