        "text": "â¦ was born on January 15th, 1926 and died on April 4th, 2005. She was a terrific actress, a world star, was known for her laughing-while-crying quality and coined the audience during the post-war years with her hope and her spirit. As an icon of her times, she portrayed real people, but was burdened all life long with the nickname âSeelchenâ (little soul), given to her by the German press. Wrongly so, because my mother was\n\none of the few German speaking actresses that achieved an international career and made it all the way to Hollywood, starring in films directed by Helmut KÃ¤utner, Wolfgang Staudte, Luchino Visconti, RenÃ© Clement and side by side with O.W. Fischer, Marcello Mastroianni, Yul Brynner, Curd JÃ¼rgens, Marlon Brando, Gary Cooper, Glenn Ford, Jean Marais and many more. On the 10th anniversary of her death the Austrian post dedicates a stamp to my mother. She lives on through her movies, which is a comfort to me because I miss her very much â as my Mom.\n\nOliver Schell\n\nâ¦ was born on January 1st, 1962 and is my (half) brother from my motherâs first marriage. He is a passionate musician, actor and he and his wife Andrea (actress and director as well) managed the small but charming theatre Berganger near Glonn in Bavaria."
