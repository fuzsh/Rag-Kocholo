He was 83.\n\nSchell was born in Vienna and raised in Switzerland after his family left the country during Adolf Hitler's rise to power. He acted on stage and screen in Europe before moving to Hollywood in 1958. (Schell's older sister Maria, who died in 2005, was also an international film star.)\n\nHis first Hollywood film was the World War II drama The Young Lions, which also starred Marlon Brando, Dean Martin and Montgomery Clift.\n\nSee other celebrities we've lost recently\n\nJudgment at Nuremberg was just his second Hollywood film.

It was his second time playing Rolfe, whom he also portrayed in an episode of the TV show Playhouse 90.\n\nSchell later transitioned into producing and directing. He received Best Foreign Film Oscar nominations for his films First Love in 1970 and The Pedestrian in 1973. He also directed the 1984 Marlene Dietrich documentary Marlene, which was nominated for Best Documentary.\n\nSchell also received a Best Actor Oscar nomination for The Man in the Glass Booth (1975) and a Best Supporting Actor nomination for Julia (1977).\n\nIn the 1990s, Schell had roles in films including Telling Lies in America and Deep Impact.
