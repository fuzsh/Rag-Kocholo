You don't smoke, don't even want to. Hey now, check your change. Dressed up like a car crash Your wheels are turnin' but you're upside down. You say when he hits you, you don't mind Because when he hurts you, you feel alive. Oh, is that what it is? Red lights, grey morning You stumble out of a hole in the ground. A vampire or a victim It depends on who's around. You used to stay in to watch the adverts You could lip synch. to the talk shows. And if you look, you look through me And when you talk, you talk at me And when I touch you, you don't feel a thing. If I could stay, then the night would give you up. Stay, and the day would keep its trust. Stay, and the night would be enough. Faraway, so close Up with the static and the radio. With satellite television You can go anywhere: Miami, New Orleans London, Belfast and Berlin. And, if you listen, I can't call. And, if you jump, you just might fall. And, if you shout, I'll only hear you. If I could stay, then the night would give you up. Stay, and the day would keep its trust. Stay with the demons you drowned. Stay with the spirit I found. Stay, and the night would be enough. Three o'clock in the morning It's quiet, there's no one around, Just the bang and the clatter As an angel runs to ground. Just the bang and the clatter As an angel hits the ground.
