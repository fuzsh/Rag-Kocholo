U2's 'Stay (Far Away, So Close!)' is a song that delves into the complexities of human emotions and relationships, particularly focusing on the themes of detachment and the search for connection. The lyrics paint a vivid picture of someone who is struggling with their sense of self and their interactions with others. The opening lines introduce a character who engages in self-destructive behavior, as indicated by the purchase of cigarettes despite not being a smoker. This act can be seen as a metaphor for the character's internal conflict and a desire to feel something, even if it's harmful.

The song continues to explore the dichotomy of being a 'vampire or a victim,' which suggests a fluctuation between feeling powerful and utterly helpless, depending on the social context. The reference to watching adverts and talk shows indicates a sense of passivity in life, where the character is merely observing rather than participating. The chorus, with its plea to 'stay,' expresses a longing for stability and the hope that a moment of peace or clarity could be sustained. The night is personified as something that could 'give you up,' implying that darkness holds the character in its grip, and there's a desire to be released from it.

The latter part of the song expands the scope to a more global perspective, mentioning various cities around the world. This could symbolize the universal nature of the struggle for connection and the feeling of being lost. The 'static and the radio' could represent the noise and chaos of life that makes it hard to find direction. The closing lines, with the 'angel runs to ground,' might suggest a fall from grace or a moment of realization. The song's haunting and introspective nature invites listeners to reflect on their own experiences of isolation and the human desire for meaningful connections.
