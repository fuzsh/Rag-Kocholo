Lyrics & Meanings: Green light - Seven Eleven  / You stop in for a pack of cigarettes  / You don't smoke, don't even want to  / Hey now - check your change  / Dressed up like a car crash  / The wheels are turning but you're upside down  / You say when he hits you, you don't mind  / Because when he hurts you, you feel alive  / Is that what it is?  / Red lights, grey morning  / You stumble out of a hole in the ground  / A vampire or a victim  / It depends on who's around  / You used to stay in to watch the adverts  / You could lip synch to the talk shows  /  / And if you look, you look through me  / And when you talk it's not to me  / And when I touch you, you don't feel a thing  /  / If I could stay - then the night would give you up  / Stay, and the day would keep its trust  / Stay, and the night would be enough  /  / Far away, so close  / Up with the static and the radio  / With satellite television you can go anywhere  / Miami, New Orleans, London, Belfast and Berlin  /  / And if you listen I can't call  / And if you jump, you just might fall  / And if you shout I'll only hear you  /  / If I could stay - then the night would give you up  / Stay - then the day would keep its trust  / Stay with the demons you drowned  / Stay with the spirit I found  / Stay, and the night would be enough  /  / Three o'clock in the morning  / It's quiet and there's no one around  / Just the bang and the clatter  / As an angel runs to ground  / Just the bang and the clatter  / As an angel hits the ground",
