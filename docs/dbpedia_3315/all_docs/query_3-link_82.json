        "text": "U2 has been one of the biggest bands of the past 50 years and for good reason: Their catalog is a prime example of a band evolving and growing up before the eyes of the world.\n\nSo far, U2 has released 14 studio albums. Their catalog also features live releases, box sets, compilations and more. In total, they have sold over 175 million records worldwide.\n\nThe legend of U2 had humble beginnings. Its four members — Bono, The Edge, Adam Clayton and Larry Mullen Jr. — were all students at Mount Temple Comprehensive School in Dublin.\n\nOne day in 1976, Mullen Jr. put a flyer on the school’s bulletin board searching for musicians to start a band. He was only 14 at the time. Among the people who responded were Bono (16), The Edge (15) and Clayton (16). The band’s first practice was on September 25, 1976 in the kitchen of Mullen Jr.’s childhood home.\n\nRELATED: The Edge: 'Of Course Bono Gets Too Much For Me Sometimes!'\n\nWho would’ve thought all of this success started with a just simple post on a bulletin board and a practice in a kitchen?!\n\nU2’s list of accolades is nothing short of insane. They’ve won 22 Grammy Awards out of 46 nominations. In 2005, they were inducted into the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame. The band received the Kennedy Center Honors in 2022.\n\nIn addition to those awards, they’ve been a massive tour draw. Per Pollstar, U2 has sold over 26 million tickets since 1980. Their tours have grossed a staggering $2.12 million. The only other act to make more money on the road is the Rolling Stones with $2.16 million.\n\nWith all of this mind, we thought we’d take on the daunting task of ranking U2’s best song. Scroll through the list below to see which songs from their vast catalog we think are their 50 best!"
