        "text": "I used to play SbS repeatedly at work. When work was a barracks in Ulster. And I’d use the conflicts that that act invited to educate others on the nuances of the situation we were in. It was worth the bruises.\n\nNot their best though, that’s unforgettable fire. Running to stand still always hits me too, due to a loss that way.\n\nI love Gone, from Pop. Excellent Edge-ism, one of the first basslines I learned to play, randomly self-aware lyrics… I know nobody likes Pop but I loved it at the time and I think it still stands up better than most.\n\nAlso, it gained extra poignancy after Bono had that horrible mountain bike crash after he took some steps that made him feel dizzy. Though he did not get to like the way it felt.\n\nI was once the world’s biggest fan, but lost interest after Zooropa (1993). In the meantime, I agree with anyone who says:\n\na) The band should have packed it in years ago\n\nb) The band was never the most technically accomplished in the world\n\nc) Bono’s public persona could stand with some adjustment\n\nI’m with this 100%, they were the backdrop to some interesting teenage times\n\nSunday Bloody Sunday for its infectious rabble rousing sound – their first one I really got introduced to them through\n\nWas a huge fan in the 80`s and still listen to Joshua Tree and Rattle and Hum now..\n\nCould list many tracks from both of those albums All I Want Is You, Red Hill, Silver and Gold, etc\n\nBut no-one yet has said Mothers of the Disappeared. Its such a haunting sad yet beautiful song. Was always one of my favs.\n\nEdit, and Running To Stand Still, how could i forget that….\n\nAnd so she woke up\n\nWoke up from where she was\n\nLying still\n\nSaid I gotta do something\n\nAbout where we’re going\n\nStep on a steam train\n\nStep out of the driving rain, maybe\n\nRun from the darkness in the night\n\nSinging ha, ah la la la de day\n\nAh da da da de day\n\nAh la la de day\n\nSweet the sin\n\nBitter than taste in my mouth\n\nI see seven towers\n\nBut I only see one way out\n\nYou got to cry without weeping\n\nTalk without speaking\n\nScream without raising your voice\n\nYou know I took the poison\n\nFrom the poison stream\n\nThen I floated out of here\n\nSinging ha la la la de day\n\nHa la la la de day\n\nHa la la de day\n\nShe runs through the streets…\n\nBit late to the party, but … early stuff was great, Under a Blood Red Sky was the one that got me into them and lost interest around about Achtung Baby – a friend and I were really into them and then we got Achtung Baby and just looked at each other and thought ‘something’s missing’. Still listen to everything else before that. If you like early raw stuff listen to the ‘U2 Hammersmith Palais 1982’ concert that was recorded for Radio 1, can find it on youtube, it’s like Under a Blood Red Sky on caffiene, I’ve got it on MP3 and I swear when I listen to that on a mtb ride I go a lot faster and feel 20 years old again!\n\nAnother one that I’ve always loved is Drowning Man from War.\n\nI know it’s really easy to criticise Bono, and God knows he’s an easy target, but really, what’s he guilty of? Basically, he’s incredibly passionate about a number of things, and never misses an opportunity to go on about them, not unlike another Irish rock singer, Bob Geldof.\n\nBut seriously, to lay into him the way some people do when you’ve got the likes of Morrissey or the bloke from Lost Prophets is more than a little over the top; ‘cos let’s face it, who has he actually harmed?\n\nNever went off them the way some people have, although I don’t listen to them nearly as much as I used to.\n\nOne of the most evocative tracks for me is In God’s Country – I remember driving up to glenshee to go skiing in the 80s, with that track as the playing rising sun caught the cliffs of Lochnagar, and it felt like a song couldn’t be more perfect. So many other good memories that have U2 as their soundtrack.\n\nI was a huge U2 fan from early 80s thru to probably late 2000s. Then it got a bit stale\n\nLooking back at what they recorded, the concerts, the support acts they helped get bigger e.g. Elbow 2009 tour. They are simply a great band. Great lead guitarist, great lead singer, good drummer & great bassist. Bono rightly gets pilloried as he’s a pretend Geldoff but Crikey he can sing when he’s not indulging himself.\n\nI’m going to play a lot of the back catalogue over the weekend… Very loud.\n\nBut no-one yet has said Mothers of the Disappeared. Its such a haunting sad yet beautiful song. Was always one of my favs.\n\nI love that too – One Tree Hill is also amazing.\n\nAs for after Joshua Tree or Achtung Baby it went downhill – I disagree somewhat… They did have a dip on quality – How to Dismantle an Atomic Bomb is a record I just don’t play, the last two albums have been great. Songs of Innocence is a great semi-autobiographical record. The tours supporting the last two albums have been great, the last one especially so. The sonics of Zoo TV was back but with more anger.\n\nTo be honest, I love most of what they have done and I think that whilst Bono might be a bit annoying – he doesn’t deserve the amount of stick he gets… well apart from moving the bands corporate headquarters to the Netherlands thing.\n\nMy older sister was a big music influence on me from about 1985 onwards, ie from when i was about 10 and started an interest in music.\n\nShe introduced me to the joshua tree first.\n\nId sit for hours with a walkman and tape and later a cd player listening to where the streets have no name, that incredible riff and intro blew my mind… then i got rattle and hum and loved the film, the sun valley stadium version of streets is still my favourite.\n\nStreets, Still havent found what im looking for, Bad and All i want is you, are my favourites from my favourite time of the band, almost entirely because of the guitar\n\nI play guitar because of the edge, and this is one of my most fundamental loves in life (wish i was better!) so they as a band were incredibly important and influential on me as a kid and adult.\n\nThen theres bonos lyrics, which can be incredible…\n\n“She wears my love like a see through dress”\n\nWhen everyone else was wearing happy mondays baggies i was in a biker jacket waist coat and pointy boots trying to be bono from the rattle and hum film….\n\nId agree that they started to turn after zooropa (love stay!),\n\nPop i still like very much. That velvet dress has a great Bridge section to it and the playboy mansion i like also for its simplicity.\n\nBut unlike radiohead (whom as i age i like more and can find new stuff in the their entire back catalogue, even the bleepy stuff) started to slide after Zooropa, and definitely should have stopped after Pop.\n\nAnything newer is repetitious, derivative and lacking in soul or creativity imho.\n\nI have that on vinyl with a BBC label on the plain white cardboard sleeve\n\njamj1974 – How did you manage to get that? I thought there wasn’t anything released? I got bootleg mp3 of it years ago.\n\nMaybe I’ll try some of their latest stuff. I found after Achtung Baby I’d like maybe a few tracks on the albums, anything before that I could happily listen to the whole album. Of course these days I can just make my own playlists with favourites back then you had to press buttons to skip tracks on your CD player."
