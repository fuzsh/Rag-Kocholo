And no live versions (unless they're the only version that exists). 1 Version per song\n\n- I didn't include that Ballad of Ronnie Drew thing as it's a massive collab\n\nHope you enjoy my order.

Also excluded the live covers.\n\nWould love to see some more lists, but I know it takes a lot of time. Interested to hear any comments, and if anyone wants to know my reasoning behind any song's position/score, I would be happy to explain my reasons.\n\nWow, that was amazing and obviously took ALOT of time and effort!! I am a longtime fan (27 yrs), but can't believe that I haven't heard a lot of the songs on your list. I'm just curioius, how long have you been a fan? I've been listening to U2 for more than 1/2 my life (yes, I'm old, -50 lol) but am wondering what is the best place to get the more obscure songs? I'm actually sitting here, right now, listening to \"40\", as I am typing this, and have all the cd's and quite a lot of the singles, including a lot of imports, etc, and the Passengers cd and the MDH soundtrack, I used to work in NYC back in the day when (right next door to MSG) you could actually go into record stores and buy bootleg cds, if you could imagine that!! But I am trying to find a good source where I could get some of the songs I don't have and download them...and FYi, some of my favs are RTSS, So Cruel (those lyrics!!!)

I did put something I wrote for them, a poem, to thank them for helping me, when I need it the most, (think Crumbs again...) on their FB page, and I do hope they see it, but I'm not sure if they will or not.

THBAO, LCT, TS, Surrender, OOTS and WILATW. OK, sorry for taking up so much of your time...I have been a member on here for 10 yrs and rarely post, I guess I just made up for that!!\n\nThanks for the kind words\n\nTo answer your questions:\n\n- I've been a U2 fan since around the time of ATYCLB I think. My first experience was the best of 1980-1990, so we're talking late 90's/early 2000's. I'm 30 years old, so obviously not been there from the beginning, but loved the band's music as soon as I heard it.\n\n- Where did I download the obscure songs? Basically, there was no 1 source, and it wasn't easy either. I think you're best bet is to just type in on google \"download *u2 song* for free\" (type the song title where I put *u2 song*), and you might get lucky, however, obviously be careful on the links, and expect pop-ups and stuff. A site called fastmp3.me seemed to have a lot of them on there, but not all. I'm guessing most of the songs you haven't heard are either b-sides or songs from the anniversary/delux editions of various u2 albums.\n\nThis wikipedia list helped me find/learn about the more obscure tracks. A list of all songs recorded by U2. It also includes all the covers they've recorded too, which aren't on my list. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_songs_recorded_by_U2\n\nThere's a song on there that I wasn't sure whether to include or not called \"She's A Mystery To Me\". It is a Roy Orbison cover, but it was written by Bono and The Edge for Roy Orbison. So in a way, it is a U2 song... kind of. Not sure.\n\nThis is a list I came up with last year and posted. Giving it a quick glance, I'd make a few tweaks. I also forgot a couple tracks LIB, WUDM, OL, Invisible. So I put them in with duplicate numbers. I'm missing some B-sides that didn't stand out enough to make the cut.\n\nIf somebody wanted to put in the time to score an all time song ranking list, have everybody rank their top 50 tracks. Ever song gets point value according to place ranking. A number one song gets 50 pts, number 2 49 pts, and so forth.\n\n173.) Stranger in a Strange Land\n\n172.) Shadows and Tall Trees\n\n171.)
