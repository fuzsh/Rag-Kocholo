        "text": "The Column with the Goddess Victoria, the Roman equivalent of the Greek goddess Nike, can be seen in various movies and music videos. But I guess, the Column featuring an iconic golden ‘angel’ is mostly recognisable thanks to a 1987 romantic fantasy film directed by Wim Wenders. The film is called “Der Himmel über Berlin” (literally, “The Heavens Over Berlin”) but it was released in English-speaking countries under the title “Wings of Desire”.\n\nThe film “Wings of Desire” tells the story of immortal angels, among whom are Damiel and Cassiel, who are invisible and live in Berlin listening to the thoughts of people and comforting those who need this most. Along the way, Damiel falls in love with a sad and lonely circus trapeze performer Marion and has to make personal choices and sacrifices. “Der Himmel über Berlin” takes place in a still-Wall-divided Berlin and perfectly captures the spirit of the times.\n\nThis film has a 1993 sequel called “Faraway, So Close!” (German: “In weiter Ferne, so nah!”). Unlike the first film, it tells the story of a finally-reunited Berlin but also follows two angels who have taken an interest in the life of ordinary people, Cassiel and Raphaella. Cassiel who chose not to become human in “Wings of Desire” only becomes human after the Fall of the Wall but this has unexpected consequences for him and his friends. Unfortunately, I have to admit that the sequel is less powerful than the original.\n\nU2’s 1993 “Stay (Faraway, So Close!)” is also based on “Der Himmel über Berlin” and its sequel “Faraway, So Close!”. Honestly, it is my favourite ever song and also my favourite ever music video of U2. The video producer Ned O’Hanlon in an online chat once told that Wim Wenders directed this video together with Mark Neale. We do not know if it’s true because others sources of credits only list Wenders involvement. Some scenes are taken direct from the movie “Faraway, So Close” that also features two U2 songs.\n\nThe music video was filmed mostly in black and white (like the movies) over only three days in October 1993. It opens on a bus at the Brandenburg Gate in Berlin. We can see the band among other people and can hear rapid, indistinguishable chatter in German, which has to be the thoughts of people on the bus. One gentleman is playing with a small music toy which is to be taken by the Edge, who starts playing with it, or rather on it, as if it’s what actually starts the song.\n\nWe can soon see that this is a night bus, N10, which goes to Zoologischer Garten (which makes sense as the single was released on the eighth U2 album Zooropa). The video also includes scenes shot from the air around the Victory Column. Just like Damiel in the movie, Bono is standing on the statue, where other band members join him later.\n\nThe black and white scenes on the streets of Berlin switch to a scene of a band rehearsing in some kind of a garage. U2, still invisible to anyone, are helping them to play, with Bono’s lines being sung by a female vocalist of the band.\n\nThe video ends with Bono falling from the sky, which has to be a direct reference to an angel shedding his immortality.\n\nThree o’clock in the morning, it’s quiet, there’s no one around,\n\nJust the bang and the clatter as an angel runs to ground.\n\nJust the bang and the clatter as an angel hits the ground.\n\n— Stay (Faraway, So Close!)\n\nIf you really love Berlin but for some reasons have not known about this story, believe me, you should not miss it! I am sure that you can watch such movies one-two-five-ten times and every time you will discover a new meaning, a new thought or a new line that will somehow do the trick again.\n\nP.S. Of course, you can climb the Column, and it has amazing panoramic views! It is hard to believe but most Berliner have never done the column climb. From the top, you can see all the main sights: the Parliament building, the Brandenburg Gate, the Tiergarten, and the Potsdamer Platz."
