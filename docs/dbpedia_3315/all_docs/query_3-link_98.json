        "text": "July 5th 1993, Zooropa by U2 was released. It was an EP that morphed into a full LP and even beat out Siamese Dream and In Utero for a Grammy for the best alternative album.\n\nMy random thoughts....\n\nThe title track is a top five U2 song of all time for me, the crescendo at the 3:58 mark is my most favourite moment in music ever.\n\nStay (Far Away, So Close) are incredibly brilliant lyrics, and delivered so well.\n\nI wish I cared about the band 25 years ago to take notice of its release, instead of caring as much as I do today.\n\n25 Years, that is sobering, pretty much the last U2 album I really cared for which is sad, from 85 til 93 they were one of my favourite groups, when Pop came out I just couldn't get into it and everything after has had a couple of weeks play and that's it. However, getting back to Zooropa, I loved the \"weirdness\" of it, it was to me part 2 of Achtung Baby and quite often I would put both of them on random and just let them play together using a multidisk player.\n\nLoved the whole Zoo TV era and thought the concert release was great, I still have the DVD now.\n\nI was in awe of it when it came out. U2 had been one of my favorites for a long time when it came out and the departure of style for them from Joshua Tree and Rattle and Hum to Achtung Baby then to Zooropa was incredible. I was working at Turtles when it came out, I was off that day and drove to my store to pick up a copy. Right back home to play the CD. It was big at the time, too. I don't think a lot of people look back on it as such, but U2 fans were coming in picking it up, and non fans were surprised they were enjoying U2 when they would come in looking for the \"Don't\" song (Numb) that was playing on the radio at the time.\n\nI had just seen U2 live for the first time in September they year before, Zooropa was a great way to continue that experience.\n\nI first got into this band in 1993 so, yeah, I was digging this album. I liked this one and Achtung from the start, from which I went through the earlier albums and loved them all except for Rattle n Hum. Zooropa and Pop was U2 at their peak, I didn't realise it at the time but looking at all the ****ty albums that have come after Pop, I do now.\n\nU2 was kind of off my radar around this time (long story), and when I heard Numb, I had no urge to check out the rest of the album. It wasn't till probably the late 00's when I finally heard it. It's a mixed bag, with some songs I do not care for, but the title track and Stay (Faraway, So Close) are terrific, and I am a big fan of Lemon, although I think the live version from the Sydney DVD is much better.\n\nOverall, not one of their better efforts, but they were trying different stuff, with mixed results, and it is hard to fault them for that.\n\nI remember it seemed to come out of nowhere. I had no idea U2 were coming out with a new record till I saw it in the shop window. One of the first CDs I ever bought. Loved it then and love it now. Very underrated and oft overlooked. To me it's the last time U2 were still vital. They were still reaching beyond their grasp and trying to expand their sound. The songwriting was still very strong and the inspiration seemed to be really flowing. And the CD sounds fantastic and has tons of dynamics.\n\nI don't know exactly when it happened, but sometime in the last 10-15 years, Zooropa became my favorite U2 album, and the one I return to most frequently. It's the last (only?) time the band made a whole record without caring what anyone would think of it, or trying to be any specific thing, and that alone makes it incredibly noteworthy. The songs are great, the record doesn't overstay it's welcome at 10 tracks (even if a couple are a minute or two too long), the Johnny Cash guest spot is brilliant (and ballsy...remember it was pre-Rick Rubin and Cash being 'cool' again), and it all just feels very natural due to the way it came together.\n\nI have a better system now, i could give pop another chance, it just seemed to be so badly mixed and mastered when i first heard it last year (when i went from hating to much liking U2)\n\nI agree. Since \"Zooropa\", almost all of their writing has been geared towards playing in stadiums. Although I've remained a fan, I do miss the adventurous U2.\n\nWas kinda cool and different considering what had come previously from the band. That said it never held a candle to In Utero but of course the Academy isnâ€™t known for getting it right."
