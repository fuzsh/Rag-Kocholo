ÖB:s Klubba\n\nWatcher’s debut album ’Key to the Unbreachable’ was released on the 6th of June, exactly two months ago. Viktor Gustafsson, the brain behind the band, is discovering the wide realms of Heavy Metal and this single consisting of two brand new songs that show his range within the genre. The title track ’Beyond the Iron Gate’ is more in the vein of USPM like Fates Warning with a progressive touch to it, while the Swedish song ’ÖB:s Klubba’ is a speedy one over the limit. But the thing is, Viktor has no boundaries. A vocalist and musician exploring and challenging his own ability in his dedication to Heavy Metal. Watcher is simply here to stay.",

        "text": "My mind was locked inside a prison of desire With granite walls and a burning ring of fire The guards stood ready day and night to annihilate The one I am was locked beyond the iron gate Flashing by in the night a shining face of grace Just hold on your turn will come there is another way And suddenly my chains fell to my feet Without a sound the gate was opened with a key Let me out Get me out Break me out Send me out Fire! Beyond the iron gate! Fire! Is breaking up the chains it's not too late! Desire Get away The fire Shows the way The darkness is leaving my mind The evil I start to decline The iron gate starts to break down No longer I'm fooling around Broken around was the shackles of my past The feeling in my mind was fiercely unsurpassed The key that opened up was formed like a cross The demons deep inside were far away and lost A holy fire was lit inside my eyes were burning bright Tongues of fire a new desire the darkness I will fight And suddenly I saw the chains at my feet They were reshaped to a golden cross-like key I'll let you out I'll get you out I'll break you out I'll send you out Fire! Beyond the iron gate! Fire! Is breaking up the chains! Fire! Beyond the iron gate! Fire! Is breaking up the chains it's not too late!"
