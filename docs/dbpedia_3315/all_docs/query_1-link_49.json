        "text": "Today we are taking a look at the first video filmed for “Staring at the Sun,” which was directed by Jake Scott, son of famed filmmaker Ridley Scott. To be frank, I like this video quite a bit, and I definitely prefer it to the second video, although the members of U2 don’t seem to […]\n\nRead More\n\n“Discotheque” was the lead video from U2’s 1997 album Pop, and, despite the somewhat cooler reception that that album received, it seems that Discotheque, and its video, remain well-liked by fans. “Discotheque’s” main video is very kitschy and fun, and heavily references club culture and the 1970s disco era. The video starts out with a […]\n\nRead More\n\nThe war in Sarajevo was a time of pure atrocity. Thousands of people died, and the city of Sarajevo, once a beautiful cosmopolitan city, was reduced to rubble. If you are interested in the details, there is a very informative and well-written Wikipedia page on the siege. We’re here today to talk about the videos […]\n\nRead More\n\nRight from the beginning, I should tell you that there is a lot going on in this video. Firstly, we have scenes from the live-action film Batman Forever, the soundtrack to which is where the song initially appeared. I don’t know a lot about how these kinds of music videos are made, so I don’t […]\n\nRead More\n\nU2’v promotional video for “Stay (Faraway, So Close) is a fun and interesting little movie, directed by the German Film-maker Wim Wenders. Wenders is a friend of the band’s who has worked with them on several projects, but of all the U2-related projects that he has directed, this video is probably my favorite. The video […]\n\nRead More\n\nIf you are living in the United States, you might have subscribed to U2 X-Radio, U2’s channel on Sirius XM Radio. If you haven’t, you really ought to, because, in addition to playing a full set of U2 tracks every day, they also play the occasional song by other artists that might introduce you to […]\n\nRead More\n\nThe single for “Numb” is kind of an odd duck. As opposed to the traditional vinyl, cassette, or CD single with audio tracks, the single for “Numb” was released as a VHS cassette. The “A-side” is the promotional video for “Numb,” which we discussed last week. As you might expect, there are also “B-sides,” or […]\n\nRead More\n\nWhenever I get involved in a conversation about U2 with anyone who is of a certain age, I cam predict, almost verbatim, how the conversation is going to go. The gist is that the other person will say that they like U2’s older stuff, but that the band got too weird in the 1990s. I […]\n\nRead More\n\nI don’t mind experimental art. Heck, I even like the Passengers album, but sometimes a little avant-garde goes a long way. Such is the case with U2’s video for “Until the End of the World,” directed by Richie Smyth. I know that Smyth is capable of making good videos because he was one of the […]\n\nRead More\n\nWhen I was younger, I used to think that music videos were a natural offshoot of being a musician. I imagined that all one had to do to make a successful music video was to show up, strike a pose or two, and that was the end of it. When I was a little older, […]\n\nRead More"
