        "text": "What’s that old saying about outrunning wildlife?\n\n“I don’t need to be faster than the bison, I just need to be faster than the rest of my group.”\n\nApparently that was the mindset of these people caught on camera in Yellowstone National Park getting a little too close to a massive bison.\n\nNow, we see stories and videos all the time about what can happen if you get too close to these creatures. And honestly, it should be common sense anyway. But, some people are idiots.\n\nAccording to NBC Montana, a small group of visitors (with a small child) approached a bison last year, and needless to say, the bison did not want to be bothered, because it charged right back at the visitors.\n\nIn the footage, you can see the bison charge two adults and a child, with one of the adults bailing on the child and running for safety. Tell me why the adults always put their kids in danger and then run away when the bison charges? Blows my mind…\n\nThankfully, right before the child was about to be railroaded by the charging bison, he’s lifted out of harm’s way by one of the other adults who seems to take a horn in the back in the process.\n\nThe bison ended up lifting the man off the ground, and it looks like it may have just got his shirt or jacket, but it’s hard to tell. He may very well have taken a nice jab to the back. Either way, hopefully it was enough for them to learn a lesson.\n\nAnd of course, the two morons who left the kid high and dry are still standing around like the danger is over. Unreal…\n\nTowards the end of the video, some genius hits the bison with bear spray, even though they’re the ones pestering the bison.\n\nGranted, it appears they are on a designed walking path, but still, the bison doesn’t know that, or care. And you can see all the other people in the background standing very far away. There’s a good reason for that…\n\nAccording to MSN, the man and his family were walking on a boardwalk near Giant Geyser when a bull perceived them as a threat and charged. While the first attempt missed, the family remained in the area (smart…) and eventually the bison charged again.\n\nTwo of the adults fled, leaving a helpless small child behind. A third man grabbed the kid from harm’s way (potentially saving the kid’s life), but took a horn to the arm in the process.\n\nHe was sent to the Eastern Idaho Regional Medical Center for care and treatment. No word is out on his condition yet.\n\nListen, I get wanting to stay around and see as many awesome sights as you can, hell Yellowstone National Park has been on my bucket list for years, but if a freaking bison is getting even relatively near me, let alone my family, I’m getting the HELL out of there.\n\nHow many of these stories do we need to hear?\n\nStay away from the bison, people.\n\nI can’t believe I have to type that out…\n\nKid Runs For His Life When Bison Charges His Family\n\nIt is really non-stop, isn’t it? Time after time, just incredibly stupid bison encounters from visitors to Yellowstone National Park. It’s really surprisingly how few people actually get hurt in these wild videos, however when they do, it’s never good.\n\nSo once again for the people in the back, these are not fluffy cows, they’re not friendly, and they will run you over without a second thought.\n\nThe video starts with an entire family walking directly towards a bison that is standing next to a boardwalk. Although there are many stupid people way too close, this family is the king of them all as they decide to walk straight up to this bison. They get within a few feet of it and all start taking cellphone pictures.\n\nThe man video taping this wild event from afar sums up what we are all thinking perfectly.\n\n“See him gesturing? See his head movements? Saying ‘I will get you, I will get you.'”\n\nThe bison continues to give them fair warning it is not happy. The crowd start to realize and disperse. However, four people stay put and quickly learn what the bison was communicating. One man starts to run away a bit from the increasing angry animal and everything starts to run including the bison.\n\nMost of their family makes it to higher ground. The bison stays on the tail of one of the smallest people there who is hung out to dry by mom and dad. Luckily, the boy is able to use the bushes to help get away as he gets chased in a circle with everyone shouting for him to run.\n\nHe makes it away safe and everyone in the area realizes they need to take a good 10-steps back. And perhaps the craziest part? The man who seems to be his father is laughing the whole time… ain’t nothing funny about that one, dad. Other than how stupid you are.\n\nThe kid got lucky… real lucky.\n\nBrown Bears Battle Over Whale Carcass Off Coast Of Alaska\n\nI just got back from the lovely state of Montana, and while I didn’t run into any bears while I was there (probably a good thing), you get a first hand account of the vast, incredible, and humbling beauty this country has to offer.\n\nAnd while Montana is amazing it gets no more vast, incredible and humbling than Alaska.\n\nIn this incredible footage at the Katmai Coast of Southern Alaska, we get to watch as two coastal brown bears engage in a vicious fight over a beached whale carcass.\n\nA whale carcass beached on the Alaskan coast prompted several dramatic fights between scavenging bears over the newfound bounty.\n\nThe scene was caught on camera at the Katmai coast in southern Alaska, in August 2015, as a massive male attacked a smaller female with a cub at the carcass, briefly gaining the upper hand until a different male attacks, saving the female.\n\nAnd we have a front row seat."
