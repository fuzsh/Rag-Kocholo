        "text": "ROSE EVELETH, HOST:\n\nHi there. It's Rose. This is the final episode of Tested. And at the very end of this episode, there are two bad words.\n\nHENK BOTHA: Quicker, quicker, quicker. Go, go, go, go. Don't beat that. Up - it's a quick movement, right?\n\nEVELETH: Christine Mboma trains in a nondescript gym in Windhoek, the capital of Namibia. It's...\n\nBOTHA: Yes.\n\nEVELETH: ...Not fancy, and it's certainly not private. She's training next to middle-aged men who are just trying to get their workout in before they head into the office while her coach, Henk Botha, pushes her.\n\nBOTHA: Lift it up, Cinny (ph). Your mind is the strongest I've seen in an athlete, so show me your mind, Christine.\n\nUNIDENTIFIED PERSON #1: Go, go, go.\n\nBOTHA: Come on, Christine. Come on, Christine.\n\nEVELETH: At one point, Christine is sitting against a wall, her legs at a 90-degree angle, holding a medicine ball out in front of her.\n\nBOTHA: I know the pain is there, but you're not going to give up. You're not going to give up.\n\nUNIDENTIFIED PERSON #1: Go, go, go, go.\n\nBOTHA: We don't give up.\n\nEVELETH: She has to keep the position for a full minute.\n\nBOTHA: I want ball. Come on. Yes, yes, yes. Five, three, thank you (laughter).\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)\n\nEVELETH: This is the life of an elite athlete. Before the spotlight, the glory, the finish line at the Olympics, there is this - pain and sweat and unglamorous days at the gym. And for Christine, she's had to go through more than just hard workouts. Her road to Paris included things that almost no other athletes have to go through - regular blood tests and drugs. But just like every other athlete, Christine still had to run an Olympic qualifying time by the deadline, June 30. And after failing to qualify at the Kip Keino Classic back in April, time was running out.\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)\n\nEVELETH: Over in Kenya, Maximila Imali was doing her own kind of training, preparing for her case at the Court of Arbitration for Sport, or CAS. When I called her in April, she told me she was constantly in touch with the people helping with her case.\n\nMAXIMILA IMALI: I always talk to them because they need to prepare me very well. We need to -actually to prepare for the testimonies and everything.\n\nEVELETH: Not being able to compete in elite races has taken a toll on Max's income. She told me that she struggles to find the money to continue in athletics. She has to scramble and scrounge to pay her coach, get to the track and even to feed herself.\n\nIMALI: Sometimes, like yesterday, you know, I went the whole day until 20:30 p.m. - at that time is the time that I ate something. It's not good. I need, at least, to have a good diet, and all of these things need money. I went bankrupt, totally bankrupt. I have nothing to my account. So I'm fighting this alone, and it was very painful.\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)\n\nEVELETH: Christine and Max are just two of the women impacted by these policies. They chose different paths - take the medications, take World Athletics to court - but they're both living with the effects of these policies every single day. And over the last few months, they've both been preparing for one of the hardest things they've ever done. And on this final episode, you're going to find out how it went for each of them and how their stories could affect so many other athletes.\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)\n\nEVELETH: From CBC and NPR's EMBEDDED, this is Tested. I'm Rose Eveleth.\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)\n\nEVELETH: In April, Max was just a week away from flying to Switzerland to present her case to the Court of Arbitration for Sport, or CAS.\n\nIMALI: Now I'm so nervous because, you know, it's my first time to go and contest the case. Sometimes, you feel that, like, this case - are we going to win this case, or what are we going to do?\n\nEVELETH: Are you allowed to talk to people during the case?\n\nIMALI: You will not be there?\n\nEVELETH: No, I can't be there. I was hoping, but I can't come.\n\nIMALI: OK. I'll be talking to you, actually. We'll be talking.\n\nEVELETH: On that call, Max and I made a plan that I would call her every day at the end of the hearings so we could talk about how it went. And on the first day of the case, I called. And instead of answering, Max sent a cryptic note asking me to talk to her lawyers. Something unexpected had happened, and I made a lot of calls to try and figure out what it was. At this point, all I can tell you is that things didn't go the way anybody had planned.\n\nThe court has still not released anything about the hearing. And no one - on either side - is talking about it publicly yet. And since there's still been no public decision, it means that Max has no shot at Paris.\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)\n\nEVELETH: Without a ruling from the court striking down the testosterone rules, she can't race to qualify. So she's missing the Olympics once again.\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)\n\nEVELETH: And while I can't tell you what went on in the courtroom, I can share something with you that happened outside of it. Here's Payoshni Mitra, the athlete's rights advocate. She was in Switzerland with Max, and she said something that surprised me.\n\nPAYOSHNI MITRA: I would say that I have witnessed the most powerful moments of my career in that week, which made me feel like, you know, life is worth living.\n\nEVELETH: Max wasn't the only athlete who went to Switzerland for this case. There were other women impacted by these rules who had flown in from around the world to speak in front of the court. And when they came together, they had time to basically hang out and talk, which is kind of unprecedented.\n\nMITRA: Each of these athletes have been made to feel, in the past, you have something wrong about your body. You are inadequate. And therefore, you are not supposed to talk about it in public. You should be ashamed of your body. You should hide it. You should fake injury and not say what exactly has happened. And therefore, this has not allowed them to feel any connection with anyone else because they always felt they're the only one going through this.\n\nThey felt that this time, because they're together, they are not willing to accept being treated unequally. And in a very organic way, they came together and said things like, we are not going to be oppressed again.\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)\n\nEVELETH: Regardless of what happens at CAS, some of these athletes say that they will never give up. Last December, Caster Semenya spoke at a sports and human rights conference at the United Nations. Here's what she said.\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)\n\nCASTER SEMENYA: The minute you start categorizing women's sports, you're touching us, and we come for you. I promise that, as long as I live, I'm never going to stop. I'm going to be that whistle in your ear. Your ceilings will be written - Caster Semenya. So...\n\nUNIDENTIFIED PERSON #2: (Laughter).\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nEVELETH: The Court of Arbitration for Sport isn't the only way to fight these rules. Last year, Caster Semenya won a case in front of the European Court of Human Rights, a ruling that is now being challenged by the Swiss government.\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)\n\nEVELETH: Meanwhile, Christine was still trying to make it to Paris. And after her last-place finish in Nairobi, Henk told me that she was struggling - not physically, but mentally. After Kip Keino, she went home and ran a small race in Namibia on the track where she trains, but she didn't land a qualifying time there either.\n\nChristine doesn't like discussing her problems. When I was with her in January, I asked her who she goes to when things get hard. And she told me that she rarely talks to anybody.\n\nCHRISTINE MBOMA: I really don't, you know, talk to, like, people. Like, for me, I'm - when I tell someone my problem and then person feel pity for me, I feel bad. I don't want someone to see that I'm weak.\n\nEVELETH: At one point, in May, Henk told me that he was going to offer Christine an out.\n\nBOTHA: We will have a nice chat tomorrow. And I need to tell her, listen, if you don't want to do this anymore, let's just leave it. We are not - you are not forced. You are still a human being. You're not a object. So I'll have the talk to her - with her tomorrow, and I'll let you know.\n\nEVELETH: Henk and Christine had a long talk. And after their conversation, he told me that she agreed to talk to a sports psychologist. And Henk told me that it's important to him to not pressure her into anything.\n\nBOTHA: And I will say this a thousand times - that it's not about medals and winning and everything. It's nice to have those, but if it's not meant to be, it's not meant to be.\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)\n\nEVELETH: But Christine didn't want to give up - not yet. So in early June, they flew to Europe. Their first stop was France, where Christine visited the Eiffel Tower. The Olympics were happening so soon that the tower had the iconic rings put up. Christine posed for a selfie beneath them. Watching her Instagram stories, I couldn't help but think that she was so close, yet still so far away.\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)\n\nEVELETH: On June 18, she left Paris and ran in a tiny event in Romans in southeastern France. And again, she couldn't land a qualifying time. Then in the last week of June, Christine went to Cameroon for the African Athletics Championships. This was her last chance to hit a qualifying standard.\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)\n\nEVELETH: In the semifinal, Christine lined up in lane two. She gets off to a strong start off the blocks, and then, about halfway through, she gets passed by almost everybody in the field.\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)\n\nUNIDENTIFIED PERSON #3: (Inaudible).\n\nEVELETH: Christine came in last again. Her time was 12 seconds flat, nearly a second too slow to qualify. Christine would officially miss the Olympics in Paris.\n\nBOTHA: You know, it was just everything went wrong. We thought that will be our big one, but everything didn't work out.\n\nEVELETH: Yeah. Was she disappointed, or are you disappointed about the Olympics?\n\nBOTHA: I must be honest with you. I was. And I think - she didn't say. She said she is OK. But I can see in her face she was not happy about it. And obviously, knowing it's 20 days to go and know that other athletes are on their way and not being part of that doesn't make you happy, but it's not the end of the world.\n\nMBOMA: Yeah, I - it's sad (ph), but it's life. So I'm OK with that.\n\nEVELETH: That's very positive. You weren't sad at all? I feel like you're allowed to be a little bit sad.\n\nMBOMA: Yeah, a little bit sad. But yeah, it's OK.\n\nEVELETH: I asked Christine how she stays so positive and keeps going in the face of all of this. And she told me, basically, that her whole life has been full of hurdles. This is just one more.\n\nMBOMA: I'm a sort of person so - so a lot of worse stuff happened in my life. Like, for me, not - missing out the Olympic for this year, it won't be like - it don't bring me down. So I lost my mom. A lot of people criticize me. Worse stuff happened to me. That was - this is not the only thing, the bad thing that happened to me, but still I stand out, being strong and - yeah.\n\nEVELETH: Some people will point to Christine's failure to qualify for the Olympics as proof that these rules are necessary and working, that it was only her high testosterone that made her great. But we can't know whether or not the medications are what have kept Christine from being able to get back to her previous pace. It could be her nagging hip flexor injury from two years ago. It could be that it takes a while to get back into shape if you haven't been competing at the elite level for two years. It could be the mental toll, the stress and attention on her. It could be all of the above.\n\nWhile on the drugs, Christine has struggled with getting back to her peak competition weight. And while she says she doesn't think she's got side effects, Henk recently learned that she's been sleeping way more than usual.\n\nBOTHA: I didn't realize she's sleeping all day. She's literally in bed, covered with blankets in bed.\n\nEVELETH: Yeah. When you told Christine, like, hey, I noticed you're sleeping all day, what did she say?\n\nBOTHA: Yeah, she was like, looking at me funny at first. But I think after today's session again, she actually, like, say, yes, it's true coach. I'm sleeping more than usual. And I feel like I can't do anything.\n\nMBOMA: The races (ph) just make me tired, yeah.\n\nEVELETH: And Christine told me that she wishes she just had more time.\n\nMBOMA: The time was short. I didn't get enough time for me to qualify.\n\nEVELETH: But it's not over for her.\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)\n\nBOTHA: And I think our focus was too big on the Olympic qualifying than just getting back to running and just getting back on a career. So that's what we are doing currently, so we haven't stopped with our season. We will go ahead and see if there are still races, and we will still run for the rest of the year.\n\nEVELETH: So you're still racing. You're going to race the rest of the season. Still - you're not, like, giving up on the drugs and trying something else.\n\nBOTHA: I mean, she's got a family to support, and we decided this is what we're going to do for at least another year. And then if we see there's still no results, then we'll look at a different option for what we'll do then, but I'm still fairly positive. She just told me she's positive. We we'll just have to work twice as hard.\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)\n\nMBOMA: I'll just - yeah, I just have to focus on my season. It's not the end of my season.\n\nEVELETH: You think you'll be back to it, though? Next Olympics, you'll be there?\n\nMBOMA: Yeah. Next time.\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)\n\nEVELETH: Over this series, we've followed Max and Christine because they are examples of two of the key choices - take the drugs or fight. But there are other athletes impacted by these rules, too, some of whom also tried to qualify for this year's Olympics. But as far as I know, based on all my reporting, none of them were able to do so. No DSD athlete, as far as I'm aware, will compete in track and field in Paris.\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)\n\nEVELETH: For the last several years, I've traveled around the world and talked to athletes and coaches whose lives have been upended by these rules. Aminatou Seyni from Niger has opted for the medication, too. I visited her back in December, in France where she trains, to talk about her decision to take the medication.\n\nWhat do you want people to know about you? Like, what would you hope that we would make sure to include?\n\nAMINATOU SEYNI: (Non-English language spoken).\n\nEVELETH: She says, I'd like people to understand one thing - even if we have a different body or even if I'm different to others, it doesn't mean I'm not human. Because there are people who judge with no holds barred.\n\nIn June, Amina started competing again, but it was too late for her to manage to qualify for Paris.\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)\n\nEVELETH: Other athletes have had irreversible changes made to their bodies in the hopes of getting to run. One of them is Annet Negesa of Uganda.\n\nANNET NEGESA: I'm a female - body female. My parents know me as female. My father know me as female. And my friends know me female.\n\nEVELETH: But in 2012, she was told she couldn't compete in the female category unless she lowered her testosterone. And to do that, she wound up having surgery to remove internal testes from her body.\n\nNEGESA: So because I like - there too much love for the sport, I had to go in for the surgery.\n\nEVELETH: Annet says that at the time, nobody made sure she understood what surgery meant. She told me that she thought they were going to give her an injection to somehow pull the testosterone out of her body. Instead, she says she woke up and found incisions on her abdomen.\n\nNEGESA: So whereby I waked up in the morning from the operation room, when I have the cuts on under my brain (ph), and I was wondering myself. And I was so scared.\n\nEVELETH: She says the surgery and lack of post-surgery care ended her career.\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)\n\nNEGESA: I didn't know the consequences which will come later. I didn't know that it would be the end of all my dream which I was chasing for.\n\nEVELETH: Annet's story was featured in a 2019 Human Rights Watch report titled \"They're Chasing Us Away From Sport.\" At least three other women have undergone surgery in an attempt to comply with the regulations. World Athletics says that it doesn't advise athletes on treatments and has, quote, \"never forced any athlete affected by its regulations to undergo surgery.\" The latest regulations specifically say, quote, \"surgical anatomical changes are not required in any circumstances.\"\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)\n\nEVELETH: Another story I'll never forget is about Margaret Nyairera Wambui. In 2016, at the Kenya national trials, she won gold in the 800 meters.\n\nCELESTINE KARONEY: She crossed the finish line. She had got a ticket to her first Olympic Games, a moment of celebration.\n\nEVELETH: That's Celestine Karoney. At the time, she was a sports reporter for CGTN Africa.\n\nKARONEY: But you have a section of the crowd saying, no, no, hapana, hapana - that's - hapana means no in Kenya - hapana, sio mwanamke. Sio mwanamke in Swahili means not a woman. When a whole crowd shouts at somebody who's won their first Olympic ticket that you're not a woman, imagine what it does to that person.\n\nEVELETH: Margaret has given up on competing in track and field at the international level. So have other runners I spoke with for this series, who have found it impossible to keep training when they have no idea if they'll be able to compete again.\n\nPayoshni, the athletes' rights advocate, is in touch with 38 women affected by these rules, not just in track and field, but in other sports, too. And all of this is happening because elite sports remain committed to that original division - men over here, women over there. Here's Alison Carlson, who worked tirelessly to get the chromosome tests abolished in the 1990s.\n\nALISON CARLSON: Humanity is messy, and sports is asking for humanity not to be messy. And they're trying to find a definitive standard or measure to make humanity less messy for the convenience of sports.\n\nEVELETH: Sports are binary. Human bodies are not. So what do we do?\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)\n\nEVELETH: There are a lot of answers to this question. Each one has pros and cons. So let's run through them, shall we? One option is do what World Athletics is doing now - ask some women to regulate their body's chemistry to be allowed to compete in the female category. And some athletes who aren't impacted by these rules don't mind them. We reached out to as many non-DSD track and field athletes as we could think of, trying to see if any of them would speak to us about these rules. Nobody would. Here's Celestine Karoney again.\n\nKARONEY: A lot of people, from early on, tended not to really speak their mind on record. So on record, nobody will tell you they're cheating - no, no, no. But the undertones you got and the whispers were that, no, this is tantamount to cheating.\n\nEVELETH: And if we do keep these regulations in some form, there's a big question we haven't tackled yet - at what age should this kind of testing and regulation begin? Here's Dr. Casey Orozco-Poore, a medical resident at UCLA and intersex health specialist.\n\nCASEY OROZCO-POORE: At what point do you look at someone's genitalia and run their blood? Do you do it at the middle school level if someone's really good? How good do they have to be before you check their genitals?\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)\n\nEVELETH: A second option is to allow for regulations but based on more appropriate science. This is what the International Olympic Committee says it believes should be done. In 2021, the IOC parted ways with World Athletics and effectively said it was getting out of the business of regulating DSD athletes. That year, the IOC published a set of principles for sports federations on how they should tackle the issue. It emphasizes words like fairness and inclusion, while leaving it up to individual governing bodies, like World Athletics, to make their own sport-specific rules.\n\nBut it says those rules should be evidence based, and the data should be gathered from a population consistent with the athletes who are being regulated. Reading between the lines, the IOC seems to be suggesting World Athletics' science isn't good enough because most of the data didn't come from DSD athletes competing at the elite level. Still, a set of principles can only do so much. Madeleine Pape works for the IOC as an inclusion specialist. She once raced against Caster Semenya, and she says the IOC's position is a balancing act.\n\nMADELEINE PAPE: On the one hand, the IOC framework insists that any policies that are put in place should be based on appropriate evidence and, at the same time, recognizes that appropriate evidence is really hard to come by.\n\nEVELETH: I asked Madeleine if the IOC would ever step in to stop World Athletics from enforcing rules that don't meet IOC standards.\n\nPAPE: You need the sport-specific knowledge to be able to identify how you're going to go about defining what, you know, you consider to be fair and meaningful competition. So I think it's not really feasible for the IOC to be able to decide for each sport, actually, what the eligibility rules should be.\n\nEVELETH: Some athletes I met in my reporting said they felt abandoned by the IOC. Here's Max Imali.\n\nIMALI: It is very frustrating because, you know, they're the head of sports. They're the ones to protect us. They have to stand for us. They know we have been violated, but they don't act on that, and that is not good at all. Yeah. I'm very pissed off with them.\n\nEVELETH: Other option is to simply not do any of this. We could let athletes like Max and Christine compete as they are and allow for whatever advantages might exist to just be one of the many advantages that one athlete might have over another. Here's Kelvin Chiringa, a radio reporter in Namibia.\n\nKELVIN CHIRINGA: A scorpion stings. Why should you want to inject it with something that stops it from stinging? That's the nature of a scorpion, to sting. Christine Mboma is a bullet. Why, then, would you want to tone down on the speed of that bullet? It was designed to move at that particular speed. So live with it. Accept it and move on.\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)\n\nEVELETH: So far, all of these solutions have still operated within a world where sports stay separated by the sex binary. But there are also solutions that people have proposed that break that. One of them is to create a third category. Sometimes you hear about this as a category for intersex competitors. Other times you hear about it as a category for trans competitors. And still other times, you hear about it as a category for nonbinary competitors.\n\nAnd some people suggest just throwing all three of those groups together into this other space. Some of the athletes impacted by these policies have supported this idea, saying, basically, fine, sure, whatever. I just want to run. But other folks have argued that this isn't a real solution. Here's Frankie de la Cretaz, a journalist who covers sports and gender.\n\nFRANKIE DE LA CRETAZ: If we're putting a third-gender category, we are essentially forcing people to out themselves either as intersex or trans just to compete, and I don't think that should be required.\n\nEVELETH: And Frankie says it's not just about ethics. It's also about just baseline practicality.\n\nDE LA CRETAZ: The trans athletes and intersex athletes who are competing at this very, very elite level are really small in number. In a team sport, you may not even have enough people at the elite level to, like, field a whole team. They just don't exist.\n\nEVELETH: The last solution and perhaps the most radical is to simply end the sex binary in sports altogether.\n\nDE LA CRETAZ: I think that we are so limited that people's imaginations won't even let us go there. What does it actually look like to blow up the way sports are organized and imagine something different?\n\nEVELETH: These solutions all try their best to tackle this big question. What is fair?\n\nDE LA CRETAZ: We talk about fairness and inclusion as if they are diametrically opposed things, but I don't think that they actually are. And I think the other question we need to ask is, fair to whom?\n\nEVELETH: Throughout this series, we've kind of skirted around a topic that you've almost certainly heard about in the news - trans athletes. The athletes I followed in this series aren't trans. And advocates for athletes with sex variations say that it's important not to conflate the two groups. But there is also some overlap in this discussion. Who gets to race in the women's category and who doesn't?\n\nRight now, DSD athletes are allowed to race with these restrictions. But trans women are no longer allowed to compete in elite track and field at all, no matter what their testosterone levels are. World Athletics officially banned them a year ago. Here's CeCe Telfer, the author of \"Make It Count: My Fight To Become The First Transgender Olympic Runner,\" talking about the day the ban was announced.\n\nCECE TELFER: I was sleeping. I got a call from my manager, and he said, it's not good. And right then and there, I knew what it was. And my heart broke because it was also on International Transgender Day of Visibility, March 31. So it was more like a slap in the face.\n\nEVELETH: And while there might be different rules governing trans and DSD athletes, CeCe points out that they do have some things in common. Both groups are constantly under extra scrutiny. And both groups just want to run.\n\nTELFER: We didn't ask to be born this way. All we asked for is accommodation and inclusivity. And we're trying to find a place for ourselves and where we belong. I'm doing this to live and to survive. This is why I'm doing this and because I love it. And it makes me free, and I want to do it at the highest level that I can possibly do it.\n\nEVELETH: There's an interesting conundrum here, and it's something that I've noticed a lot in reporting on this story. Sometimes you hear advocates for trans women in sports argue in favor of policies that limit testosterone because many trans women are already doing that. For them, it is gender-affirming care. But those exact policies are the ones that are causing harm to athletes like Christine and Max. So you have this situation where these two groups are almost pitted against one another. And at the same time, there is a lot of confusion about the differences between trans athletes and athletes with sex variations. Some people I spoke with say they think World Athletics is contributing to that confusion.\n\nSILVIA CAMPORESI: In the court for arbitration on sport in 2019, the Federation has tried explicitly through their lawyers to link together the question of trans and the question of DSD, using it as a narrative of, there is a threat, and we need to protect the female category.\n\nEVELETH: This is Silvia Camporesi, bioethicist at King's College London. She argues that World Athletics has conflated trans and DSD athletes. One reason, people argue, that they are doing this is because if the organization were to let DSD athletes run without any regulations, it would be harder for them to maintain a ban on trans women athletes. Because in the logic of World Athletics, they're basically the same. They're both, quote, \"biological males.\"\n\nCAMPORESI: And I think that was a strategic move on their part to say, if we don't regulate DSD, we'll end up with having trans athletes competing in the female category and winning all the medals.\n\nEVELETH: I asked World Athletics to respond to this allegation, but nobody there replied to my many questions. And the organization declined to do an interview for the series.\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)\n\nEVELETH: I've spent the last 10 years thinking about this story, in part because it has so many compelling wrinkles, so many people I've come to care about, so many twists and turns. But I think the reason I spent so long trying to tell this story is because it forces me to grapple with how we try and impose order on a messy, confusing world.\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF FOOTSTEPS)\n\nEVELETH: Where I live in Northern California, there's a bird called a red-shafted flicker. It gets its name because when it's flying away, you can see reddish feathers. On the East Coast, there is a very similar bird called the yellow-shafted flicker, which shows yellow feathers when it flies away. Otherwise, these birds look and sound basically the same. And they are kind of the same. They're so similar, in fact, that they can breed and create a hybrid bird that has kind of orange-colored feathers. Birding books now consider this one species. It's now called the northern flicker. And I've spent the past few months trying to see one because this bird has come to symbolize something for me.\n\nOh - oh, are you my bird? You're big enough. Where did you go? Dang it, where are you?\n\nToday, most people think that the yellow-shafted flicker and the red-shafted flicker should be considered the same species. But for many years, some birders said, no. They're different colors, so they're different. In science, we say that people are either lumpers or splitters. Lumpers are more interested in what links things, what brings things together, the things we might have in common. Splitters are more interested in differences - what makes one thing separate from another.\n\nWhat was that?\n\nThere's not necessarily a correct way of doing things. In some cases, it's useful to focus on the differences. In other cases, those differences don't really matter. It depends on your goal - the question you're trying to answer. Charles Darwin himself wrote about these two approaches in a letter in 1857, saying, it is good to have hair-splitters and lumpers. But sometimes lumping or splitting, based on genitals or chromosomes or testosterone, causes suffering. All in an effort to create neat categories, when in reality, there's just a continuum. And you have to ask how much suffering is worth allowing - and whose - in the name of categorizing?\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)\n\nEVELETH: We started this series with a fable, and it's tempting to end with one - once, there were sports, and all was good. But we're not going to do that because fables are, by their nature, simple. There is a clear villain, and a lovely little moral arc and, in the end, a straightforward answer. This story and our world is a lot more complicated than that, which isn't necessarily a bad thing. There is joy in the chaos, wonder in the spectrum. If we let ourselves embrace the bigger, weirder, more interesting world out there, we get to be excited when we see a bird no matter what color its tail feathers are.\n\nUNIDENTIFIED PERSON #4: That's a flicker. That's a flicker.\n\nEVELETH: Oh.\n\nUNIDENTIFIED PERSON #4: That's flying over that way.\n\nEVELETH: Go.\n\nUNIDENTIFIED PERSON #4: Can you see the flash of the...\n\nEVELETH: I see it.\n\nUNIDENTIFIED PERSON #4: That's a - oh, God damn it. Did you see it, though?\n\nEVELETH: I saw it. I did.\n\nUNIDENTIFIED PERSON #4: OK. Good.\n\nEVELETH: It was flying from there to there.\n\nUNIDENTIFIED PERSON #4: It was flying from there to there, yes.\n\nEVELETH: Yes.\n\nUNIDENTIFIED PERSON #4: F***ing did it.\n\nEVELETH: We did it.\n\nUNIDENTIFIED PERSON #4: Yes.\n\nEVELETH: (Laughter) For 4 1/2 seconds, we saw a flicker.\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)\n\nEVELETH: And that's it. That's Tested.\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)\n\nEVELETH: If you want to learn more about anything you heard on this show, follow along with these athletes as they keep trying to compete, hear about whatever happens with that court case, see behind-the-scenes content from my reporting - all of that good stuff - you can go to tested/podcast.com.\n\nTested is written, reported and hosted by me, Rose Eveleth.
