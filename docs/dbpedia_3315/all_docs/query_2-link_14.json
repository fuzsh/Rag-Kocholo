        "text": "The video was filmed in Berlin over the course of three days, primarily in black-and-white but with some sequences in color. It contains cameos of some of the actors who appeared in Faraway, So Close!, including Otto Sander, as well as Wenders' nephew. Several scenes are taken directly from Faraway, So Close! and Wenders' 1987 film Wings of Desire, which also served as the principal inspiration for the video's premise.\n\nWim Wenders noted that \"making a video is really a very different ballgame. You have the script, so to speak, because you have the song, and everything you do is in order to help the song shine... You want to make that song look as good as possible and sound as good as possible and as interesting as possible.\"\n\nSeveral shots depict the band members standing on the statue of Victoria, a monument at the top of the Berlin Victory Column; a model of the angel was created for those scenes. Leftover military equipment from the Cold War, including the Soviet MiG, were included in the background."
