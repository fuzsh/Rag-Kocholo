        "text": "I don't think Stay (Faraway, So Close!) originated during the Achtung Baby sessions. You might confuse it with One Shot Of Happy, Two Shots Of Sad, the song Bono wrote for Frank Sinatra during the Zoo TV Tour (so after the release of Achtung Baby but before the start of the Zooropa sessions).\n\nThe working title of the song that eventually became Stay (Faraway, So Close!) was Sinatra, but that had more to do with the sound/mood of the song (or rather, instrumental backing) than that it was meant for him."
