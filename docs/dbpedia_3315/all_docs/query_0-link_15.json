        "text": "O.P.P.Naughty by Nature\n\nThe Naughty by Nature hit \"O.P.P.\" doesn't have any curse words, but many oversensitive radio stations played a \"clean\" version with the word \"kitten\" edited out, surely the first time that word was censured.\n\nGoodbye Yellow Brick RoadElton John\n\n\"Goodbye Yellow Brick Road\" is one of the few Bernie Taupin lyrics that is more about him than Elton John. The song is about giving up glitz for the simple life - not exactly Elton's M.O.\n\nWhere It's AtBeck\n\nThe sample in Beck's song \"Where It's At\" that says \"What about those who swing both ways: AC-DC\" came from a 1969 sex-ed album for middle schoolers.\n\nBlowin' In The WindBob Dylan\n\nBob Dylan was little known when he released \"Blowin' In The Wind\" so the cover versions - especially by Peter, Paul and Mary and Stan Getz - were much more popular at the time.\n\nOne Tree HillU2\n\nThe TV show One Tree Hill got it's name from a song of the same name on U2's Joshua Tree album.\n\nLovin', Touchin', Squeezin'Journey\n\nSteve Perry wrote \"Lovin', Touchin', Squeezin'\" with the opening lyrics, \"You make me weep, I wanna die,\" after seeing his girlfriend kissing another man.\n\nAmy GrantSongwriter Interviews\n\nThe top Contemporary Christian artist of all time on song inspirations and what she learned from Johnny Carson.\n\nMovie Stars In Music VideosSong Writing\n\nJohnny Depp, Angelina Jolie, Mila Kunis and John Malkovich are just a few of the film stars who have moonlighted in music videos.\n\nRichie McDonald of LonestarSongwriter Interviews\n\nRichie talks about the impact of \"Amazed,\" and how his 4-year-old son inspired another Lonestar hit.\n\nEdwin McCainSongwriter Interviews\n\n\"I'll Be\" was what Edwin called his \"Hail Mary\" song. He says it proves \"intention of the songwriter is 180 degrees from potential interpretation by an audience.\""
