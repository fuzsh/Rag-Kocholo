Together they broke down the realities of what it’s like to be a Black podcaster in a \\“Post-Floyd era,\\” the differences in African and American Blackness, and their push-pull relationship with the ever mercurial New York City. They asked each other, well — just about anything and everything. That fruitful night became a two-part video series and now, this revealing podcast episode.",

Saidu edits our show which means he helps to shape this whole thing, deepen our curiosities and challenge our implicit biases. All in all, he works quietly behind the scenes to make this show awesome.\n\nBut being behind anything isn’t usual for Saidu. Beyond being our editor, Saidu is also a fellow podcaster, a poet, an actor — basically, Saidu is typically the one in the spotlight. The one in front of the mic. So for this episode, we gave Saidu a break from behind the scenes, and put him front and center in front of a live audience at Vermont Public studios. Host Myra Flynn and Saidu went back and forth asking one another questions about being Black podcasters in a “post-Floyd” era and the differences in Blackness, both in America and in Sierra Leone, where Saidu is from. And they swapped juicy stories about their individual times living in New York City. We’re calling this episode: Ask me anything.\n\nWatch the episode as a two-part video series!\n\nDeep listen\n\nHow to water a transplant\n\nSaidu Tejan-Thomas Jr.\n\nYou're 21\n\nYou're one of them cocky transplants from a small planet that no one's ever heard of.\n\nYou're one of them immigrants who crash landed in some culdesac, somewhere far, far away from home\n\nand you've been called an alien in every other solar system you sought asylum.\n\nYou've managed to carve an ID out of Nike SBs and Lupe Fiasco albums.\n\nAnd you're a boy with a name no one would care to pronounce, much less know.\n\nBut you knew it was never gonna be Miami, L A, Connecticut.\n\nYour dreams, your dreams would only be possible up there in new metropolis\n\nand sure there are horror stories of cities like that.\n\nThe streets occupied by tweaks and suited zombies,\n\nthe apartments, filthy with roommates and rude roaches,\n\nthe twisted faces marching towards a future that barely pays rent.\n\nThe overwhelming stench of wealth rising up all around you.\n\nAnd it's all bad gravity up there they say\n\nand no one tells you, no one understands why you would move to this sunk city.\n\nWhy you would think it possible that you would shine where so many others have failed.\n\nBut knowing you, animated by doubt, propelled by “prove it.”\n\nMaybe it's the African in your blood.\n\nMaybe it's your gut.\n\nBut you go\n\nYour voice, a fresh cut, two duffel bags and that smile your mother gave you.\n\nIt's all you pack before take off.\n\nYou whisper a promise to your reflection on the launch pad.\n\nI'm gonna take that city\n\nHaving no clue what was waiting for you on the other side\n\nAnd you fly across galaxies for years to get here\n\nAnd you finally spot new metropolis on the black horizon,\n\nStiletto skyscrapers posing with their technological face.\n\nYou glide close to row after row of windows glowing gold like the city's only got eyes for you.\n\nAnd the sight of metropolis at night is like an answer.\n\nIt's a yes, so dazzling it makes all your red flags disintegrate into rumor.\n\nIt's the kind of dreamy silhouette that makes you forget sense.\n\nThe kind of bright magic that turns all men like you into moths\n\nAnd those lights would look so good on you.\n\nAnd you start thinking to yourself that maybe one day I'll glide across these skies\n\nto brunch on Sundays with my besties like Carrie Bradshaw.\n\nOr maybe I'll find a stage that loves the color of all my stories like Jerry Seinfeld.\n\nOr maybe they'll even learn how to pronounce my name too here.\n\nYou're not even asking for it all at once.\n\nJust a chance to land somewhere\n\na small place to nest and enough money in your pocket to keep a baddie jagged breath pressed against your ear on Friday nights\n\nand oh my god, how good it would have felt to arrive to a big soundtrack like “Juicy” or something, or “Get money,” anything old school and reckless.\n\nBut what you get is the hissing of sewers.\n\nThe 3 a.m. sirens, the tin can conductors, voice over s—-- speakers.\n\nThe landlord's knock on the first of the month and every week your little sister sends you a holograms\n\nAnd she's so proud of you for leaving.\n\nShe thinks the sky of you.\n\nAnd she asked, “Hey, big brother, how is it up there?”\n\nAnd you say, “It's good. It's everything I've ever wanted.”\n\nAnd she goes, “It's good and everything I've ever wanted.”\n\nShe's like, “Be honest, how is it up there?”\n\nHonest, honest.\n\nYou would rather write her an ode for this city\n\nBecause how are you supposed to tell her about the six months of nights you spent on strangers beds, cramped couches and dusty attics.\n\nHow you tunnel through the city five days a week to hunch over a desk downtown\n\nJust knowing that everything you want is in one of them buildings\n\njust sitting on the other side of a white man's yes.\n\nHow are you supposed to say, “I feel like a glitch in this city sis and every time I open my eyes, I wanna beg my dreams for forgiveness and I'm starting to forget what my own voice sounds like.\n\nAnd I'm sorry for everything that I have not brought back home yet.”\n\nHow you supposed to tell her about this one time when you got so stressed out, you buried your head into your backpack and cried on the 2 train?\n\nAnd when you lifted your heads up, there were two niggas dancing in front of you for change.\n\nAnd all you could do was laugh.\n\nHow are you supposed to say, “I'm sorry, sis for everything that I have not brought back home yet.”\n\nAnd still, I want to stay, here, still, here, still, here.\n\nStill?\n\nEven on the days the heat sizzles me. Dizzy with lonely.\n\nAnd I get home to sweep my cat and mop my sink and open the medicine cabinet to find something to eat.\n\nEven when I lose my sense and myself to the rat race here,\n\nthere are still reasons I stay\n\nAnd I can almost hear the city laugh when I complain like that\n\nbecause I know for a thousand years it's seen a thousand of me and it knows exactly who I am.\n\nI mean, bless me with rent control and laundry in the basement.\n\nBless me with a roommate who pays her rent on time.\n\nBless me with neighbors who know my name,\n\nMiss Shirley, her 98 year old smile,\n\nBless me with all the moments.\n\nI linger a while in the hallway because the Caribbean woman next door is cooking something that reminds me so much of my mother's hands on Sundays.\n\nAnd still, every morning I wake up and I stand on the steps of the home this city made for me.\n\nAnd I don't say thank you.\n\nI get on the train.\n\nI open my book.\n\nPretend I'm the main character again.\n\nI try not to miss my stop\n\nAnd I ask for more.\n\nCredits\n\nThis episode was reported and edited by Myra Flynn and mixed by associate producer James Stewart.
