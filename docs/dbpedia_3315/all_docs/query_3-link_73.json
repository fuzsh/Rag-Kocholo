        "text": "When the James Bond, Batman and Mission Impossible franchises needed to reinvent themselves for a new decade, it only made sense that they approached U2 to come up with themes that fit the ‘90s. Between the end of the Zoo TV era in 1993 and their next album in 1997, the Irish foursome spent the time crafting theme songs for these films and more. Here’s the best of their one-offs from the period:\n\n3. GoldenEye - 007 (1995)\n\nBono and The Edge’s title track to GoldenEye captures all the mystique, suspense and sexiness of the Bond films with its delicate strings, blaring horns and voyeuristic lyrics. The cherry on top? Tina Turner’s sultry vocals.\n\n2.Hold Me, Thrill Me, Kiss Me, Kill Me - Batman Forever (1995)\n\nIf there’s one thing U2 can relate to Bruce Wayne with, it’s the trappings of fame. Their maniacal song on idol worship fit the comic book world of Batman Forever to a tee and was nominated for Best Original Song at the Golden Globes in 1995 (which U2 eventually won in 2003).\n\n1.Stay - Faraway, So Close! (1993)\n\nU2’s best soundtrack contribution is also one of their best works period. Written for long-time collaborator Wim Wender’s film about angels choosing between immorality and loving humans on Earth, Stay is a magnificent, soaring anthem on love, loss and choice. It too was nominated for Best Original Song at the Golden Globes and won the hearts of music critics and fans alike."
