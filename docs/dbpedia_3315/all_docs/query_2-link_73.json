        "text": "anonymous\n\nclick a star to vote\n\n!⃝\n\nI always heard the lyrics \"when he hits you\" and \"because when he hurts you\" as \"when it hits you\" (as in the car crash) and \"it comes when it hurts you\". I didn't hear the \"he\" as in a person hurting her, so none of my interpretation includes themes of abuse. Also, I didn't see either angel movie, so to me, the angel line is talking about the girl, metaphorically, silently falling. I'm also a Gen Z listening to this song, so that makes it a little different.\n\nFor me, it's about anyone who's numb and you can't get through to them. Somebody who stares off into space. They've given up and they're not the same as they used to be. It can be about someone you're trying to talk with, but they're distracted, or their head is empty from TikTok, or they're not in reality, or they're letting their demons get the best of them while you're trying not to let your demons get the best of you. The world is ending and nobody cares. The person is dying inside, but they themselves are apathetic. It's just sad. It reminds me of \"Numb\" by U2 and a more desperate version of \"Running to Stand Still\" by U2 (which is a song about heroin addiction). You want them to stay but they're drowning in demons (\"When the demons you drown\").\n\nAnyway, I don't know if anybody thought a Gen Z would care about this song. I think the abuse and guardian angel themes people have talked about really go with this kind of interpretation, though. U2 is definitely my favorite band/artist (I've noticed their songs are a lot more serious than the pop I've grown up hearing).\n\nNow I'm no expert at analyzing U2 songs, but a lot of these lyrics tend to reference domestic violence.\n\nFor instance:\n\n\"You say when he hits you, you donâ€™t mind\n\nBecause when he hurts you, you feel alive.\"\n\nThat's pretty straight in what it's saying. A woman is trying to defend her boyfriend/husband who is hurting her. Also, at the end of the song, Bono sings:\n\n\"Three oâ€™clock in the morning\n\nItâ€™s quiet and thereâ€™s no one around\n\nJust the bang and the clatter\n\nAs an angel runs to ground\"\n\nSounds as if the woman is either knocked down to the ground by her lover, or she gets killed. Lastly, the first line of the chorus:\n\n\"If I could stay.. Then the night would give you up\"\n\nSounds like the narrator sees what is happening and wants to help, but finds it hard to do anything.\n\nJust some food for thought."
