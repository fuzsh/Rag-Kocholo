        "text": "U2 has released “Atomic City,” their new single written in tribute to Las Vegas, which is the location of their “U2:UV” residency that kicks off September 29.\n\nThe video for the new song is below. It harkens back to the band’s classic video for “I Still Haven’t Found What I’m Looking For,” which was also filmed on Freemont Street in Las Vegas in 1987. The video is also reminiscent of the clip for “All Because of You,” which also saw the band perform on a flatbed truck through the streets of New York.\n\n“Atomic City” is available for streaming and download here.\n\nAs previously reported, the video for “Atomic City” was filmed on September 16. Variety noted that 250 extras were recruited for the video.\n\nDespite not taking part in the residency, drummer Larry Mullen Jr. took part in the recording of “Atomic City” and its accompanying video. Mullen Jr. shared in November 2022 that he needs surgery due to the wear and tear of drumming for decades. Bram van den Berg will be filling in for him during the residency.\n\nU2’s highly anticipated Vegas kicks off tonight (September 29) at the new MSG Sphere.
