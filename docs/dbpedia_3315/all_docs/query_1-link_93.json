        "text": "U2 has released “Atomic City,” their new single written in tribute to Las Vegas, which is the location of their “U2:UV” residency that kicks off September 29.\n\nThe video for the new song is below. It harkens back to the band’s classic video for “I Still Haven’t Found What I’m Looking For,” which was also filmed on Freemont Street in Las Vegas in 1987. The video is also reminiscent of the clip for “All Because of You,” which also saw the band perform on a flatbed truck through the streets of New York.\n\n“Atomic City” is available for streaming and download here.\n\nAs previously reported, the video for “Atomic City” was filmed on September 16. Variety noted that 250 extras were recruited for the video.\n\nDespite not taking part in the residency, drummer Larry Mullen Jr. took part in the recording of “Atomic City” and its accompanying video. Mullen Jr. shared in November 2022 that he needs surgery due to the wear and tear of drumming for decades. Bram van den Berg will be filling in for him during the residency.\n\nU2’s highly anticipated Vegas kicks off tonight (September 29) at the new MSG Sphere. A full list of residency dates is below.\n\nU2 – “U2:UV” Residency Dates\n\nFriday, September 29\n\nSaturday, September 30\n\nThursday, October 5\n\nSaturday, October 7\n\nSunday, October 8\n\nWednesday, October 11\n\nFriday, October 13\n\nSaturday, October 14\n\nWednesday, October 18\n\nFriday, October 20\n\nSaturday, October 21\n\nWednesday, October 25\n\nFriday, October 27\n\nSaturday, October 28\n\nWednesday, November 1\n\nFriday, November 3\n\nSaturday, November 4\n\nFriday, December 1\n\nSaturday, December 2\n\nWednesday, December 6\n\nFriday, December 8\n\nSaturday, December 9\n\nWednesday, December 13\n\nFriday, December 15\n\nSaturday, December 16\n\nU2: Their 50 Best Songs, Ranked\n\nU2 has been one of the biggest bands of the past 50 years and for good reason: Their catalog is a prime example of a band evolving and growing up before the eyes of the world.\n\nSo far, U2 has released 14 studio albums. Their catalog also features live releases, box sets, compilations and more. In total, they have sold over 175 million records worldwide.\n\nThe legend of U2 had humble beginnings. Its four members — Bono, The Edge, Adam Clayton and Larry Mullen Jr. — were all students at Mount Temple Comprehensive School in Dublin.\n\nOne day in 1976, Mullen Jr. put a flyer on the school’s bulletin board searching for musicians to start a band. He was only 14 at the time. Among the people who responded were Bono (16), The Edge (15) and Clayton (16). The band’s first practice was on September 25, 1976 in the kitchen of Mullen Jr.’s childhood home.\n\nRELATED: The Edge: 'Of Course Bono Gets Too Much For Me Sometimes!'\n\nWho would’ve thought all of this success started with a just simple post on a bulletin board and a practice in a kitchen?!\n\nU2’s list of accolades is nothing short of insane. They’ve won 22 Grammy Awards out of 46 nominations. In 2005, they were inducted into the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame. The band received the Kennedy Center Honors in 2022.\n\nIn addition to those awards, they’ve been a massive tour draw. Per Pollstar, U2 has sold over 26 million tickets since 1980. Their tours have grossed a staggering $2.12 million. The only other act to make more money on the road is the Rolling Stones with $2.16 million.\n\nWith all of this mind, we thought we’d take on the daunting task of ranking U2’s best song. Scroll through the list below to see which songs from their vast catalog we think are their 50 best!\n\nErica Banas is a news blogger who's been covering the rock/classic rock world since 2014.
