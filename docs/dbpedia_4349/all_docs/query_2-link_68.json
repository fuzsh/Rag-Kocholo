        "text": "“I had to wild swim in Coniston Water once or twice.\n\n“And I was in Derwent Water three times…and it was very cold.”\n\nChristopher Eccleston talking to me about his role as former police detective Robert in new ITV drama Safe House, filmed in the Lake District.\n\n“The house is a central character. We do have the sense the ‘safe house’ is ironic. Because it’s not safe.”\n\n“THERE are an awful lot of things that are plausible and just a few things that are probable.”\n\nRory Kinnear talking to me about new two-part ITV drama Lucan, which tells a story most will not know.\n\nHe plays the Lord who created a headline-grabbing mystery after murdering his children’s nanny Sandra Rivett (Leanne Best).\n\nHaving mistaken her in a darkened basement kitchen for his wife Lady Lucan (Catherine McCormack).\n\nAnd then vanishing – never to be seen again.\n\nHE is, without a shadow of a doubt, the scariest man on TV.\n\nThe Shadow Line’s James Gatehouse, played by Stephen Rea.\n\nClosely followed in the chilling stakes by Rafe Spall’s portrayal of Jay Wratten.\n\nAnd next Thursday we meet a third contender – Peter Glickman (Antony Sher).\n\nFull of ticking menace in a Dublin clock shop.\n\n“I”M just a flower man, sergeant.”\n\nHot on the heels of Exile comes another top class TV thriller.\n\nThe Shadow Line begins a seven-part series on BBC2 tonight, with Christopher Eccleston as that flower man Joseph Bede.\n\nBACK from a screening plus Q&A tonight for new BBC1 drama series Accused.\n\nWith writer Jimmy McGovern, producer Sita Williams and actor Christopher Eccleston, who plays Willy in the first story next Monday.\n\nI asked Jimmy about his recent comments that TV drama should say more about the world we live in today and not rely on costumes, irony and pastiche.\n\nTaken as a criticism of, among other dramas, Downton Abbey – which he has never seen.\n\nWhat was his reaction to the flak his comments attracted?\n\nIT’S no secret that Christopher Eccleston is one of my favourite actors.\n\nMaybe yours too?\n\nHe’s a class act and as intelligent off screen as on.\n\nI spoke to him recently – on the day after the government’s spending cuts were announced – about his role in episode one of Jimmy McGovern’s new BBC1 series Accused.\n\nWhich includes his character Willy calling a banker a name I can’t repeat here.\n\nMy interview with Chris is in today’s Manchester Evening News, and also online below with a few extras I couldn’t fit into the main article.\n\n“FOR heaven’s sake, sit down,” pleads John Lennon’s estranged father.\n\n“I’ve not sat down since 1962,” his son replies.\n\nLennon Naked (BBC4, 9:30pm tonight) is a marvellous film with another top class performance by Christopher Eccleston.\n\nAlthough the one-off 90-minute drama begins in the middle of black and white Beatlemania, it mainly focuses on the years 1967 to 1971.\n\nIncluding the break-up of The Beatles and John’s life changing meeting with Yoko Ono, played by Torchwood star Naoko Mori."
