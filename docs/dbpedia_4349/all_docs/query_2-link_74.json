I'm not sure if she has a name yet (i don't think she has, she hasn't mentioned it) but i can't seem to think of any names just incase! I'm trying not to get excited, and if for some reason this doesn't come through, other people can look at this and name a new piggie/un-named one.\n\nHas anyone any suggestions, male or female (for the others looking for name suggestions for themselves)\n\ni liked Bella for a girl, i'm not sure though because i like really unusual names. rolleyes\n\nI think its best to get a piggy first before naming or to go on what they look like. Here are mine:-\n\nBoars\n\nSunshine - Colour of the sun\n\nTwinkle - Pointy Aby/Peruvian starlike rosettes!\n\nCuzzy - Blonde daughter couldn't say custard but said cuzzy!\n\nEccles - Named after Christopher Eccleston (9th Doctor Who)\n\nPudsey - Blonde named after Pudsey Bear as we got him on CIN night\n\nRadley - Named after the Handbags, Kelly on here named him!\n\nMilo - Put to a poll on here!\n\nJasper - Was already named at rescue.\n\nSows\n\nFlora - Floral named\n\nFleur - Flora's sister named after Fleur in Harry Potter and becaue she has some orange in her like a Flare.\n\nAmber - Brown Gem Stone\n\nPearl - White Gem Stone\n\nElora - Little girl in Willow\n\nLeia - Princess Leia Star Wars\n\nLyra - Little girl in the Golden Compass.\n\nSo if something takes your fancy, or she reminds you of something go for that.\n\nI already have one pig called Flash. I don't have a theme though! :red\n\ngood names everyone! Both my middle names are in the flower list that stargrrlclaire wrote\n\nSo far i really like Lilly, Scarlet, Poppy, Lottie and Fleur!\n\nI have a french obsession at the moment, with the language and place, so if anyone has any suggestions for that!"
