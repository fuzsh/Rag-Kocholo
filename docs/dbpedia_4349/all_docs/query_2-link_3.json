Christopher Eccleston trained at the Central School of Speech and Drama and first came to public attention as Derek Bentley in Gib's Ihm Chris! (1991). However, it was a regular role in the television series Für alle Fälle Fitz (1993) that made him a recognizable figure in the United Kingdom. He appeared in the low-budget thriller Kleine Morde unter Freunden (1994), and in...",

        "text": "[on his accent in Doctor Who (2005) - although he was wrong because Sylvester McCoy clearly had a Scottish accent] I'm different from the other Doctors in that I'm northern. All the others spoke with this RP accent [received pronunciation] - maybe it was that that put me off. I think that it's good that we teach kids that people who speak like that can be heroic.\n\nTheatre is an actor's medium. Film and television is primarily a director's medium. When you act in the theatre you get a four to six week rehearsal period, where you can build a character, and of course each evening when you give a performance, you have the final edit. So theatre acting is my great love. But I've had some very interesting and rewarding experiences in front of the camera.\n\nIf I had my choice, I would exclusively do theatre, if I could justify it financially. Theatre in my country is by and large very lowly paid, so actors have to supplement it with television and film work, if they're fortunate enough to be able to do that.\n\nThe best thing about Doctor Who (2005) for me has been the response I've had from children, both in the street and the number of letters and drawings of me and Daleks, which are all over my wall at home. In all the 20 years I've been acting, I've never enjoyed a response so much as the one I've had from children and I'm carrying that in my heart forever.\n\n[on Doctor Who (2005)] I was open-minded but I decided after my experience on the first series that I didn't want to do any more. I didn't enjoy the environment and the culture that we, the cast and crew, had to work in. I wasn't comfortable. I thought \"If I stay in this job, I'm going to have to blind myself to certain things that I thought were wrong.\" And I think it's more important to be your own man than be successful, so I left. But the most important thing is that I did it, not that I left. I really feel that, because it kind of broke the mold and it helped to reinvent it. I'm very proud of it.\n\nI don't really do heroes. Heroes are dangerous because it's very unrealistic to elevate people to heroic status. Lennon (John Lennon) was somebody I admired but I came to him quite late. And there was no doubt he was somebody who could be quite difficult to love.\n\n[on Accused - Eine Frage der Schuld (2010)] Writing of this quality doesn't come along too often. I have great respect and affection for Jimmy (Jimmy McGovern). We go back 17 years now, and this is the sixth time I've worked for him. He's been the spine of my career.\n\nI've kept my word with the audience and not fed them rubbish. I've done some rubbish elsewhere, though, and I've let myself down in that way. But I think I can hold my head up - I don't think I've ever done it for the money on British telly. I always choose roles with my heart.\n\nI confess I don't watch much film or television drama but I'm aware of the preponderance of white, male roles. There's not enough writing for women or people of colour. It frustrates me when they insist on doing all-male Shakespearean productions - a wonderful intellectual exercise maybe, but it's outrageous because it's putting a lot of women out of work.\n\nOften as a child you see someone with a learning disability or Down's Syndrome and my mum and dad were always very quick to explain exactly what was going on and to be in their own way inclusive and welcoming.\n\n[a message at a BFI celebration of Doctor Who (1963)'s 50th anniversary] I love the BFI. I love the Doctor and hope you enjoy this presentation. Joe Ahearne directed five of the 13 episodes of the first series. He understood the tone the show needed completely - strong, bold, pacy visuals coupled with wit, warmth and a twinkle in the performances, missus. If Joe agrees to direct the 100th anniversary special, I will bring my sonic and a stair-lift and - providing the Daleks don't bring theirs - I, the ninth Doctor, vow to save the universe and all you apes in it.\n\n[on Our Friends in the North (1996)] I was standing on the set of Kleine Morde unter Freunden (1994) and Danny Boyle said, 'I've read something you'd like.' I got hold of the scripts and read them in one sitting. There's a scene in which Nicky's embittered idealist dad, Felix - played by the wonderful Peter Vaughan - is savaged by a dog on a council estate. He is effectively destroyed by everything he felt he'd failed to create as a socialist. I thought it was an absolutely brilliant piece of writing. I knew it was event television from that single scene."
