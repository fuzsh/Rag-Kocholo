        "text": "Former Doctor Who headliner Christopher Eccleston exited the sci-fi show after just one season – so, why did he leave?\n\nRecommended Videos\n\nRelated: Is the 1996 Doctor Who Movie Canon?\n\nWhy Christopher Eccleston Left Doctor Who, Explained\n\nChristopher Eccleston starred as the Ninth Doctor in Series 1 of the BBC’s 2005 Doctor Who revival. Many fans expected Eccleston to remain at the helm of the Doctor’s time-and-space-traveling TARDIS for multiple additional seasons. Instead, he departed the show after Series 1 wrapped up. This was explained in-universe by Doctor Who‘s recurring renegeration plot device, with the Ninth Doctor transforming into David Tennant’s Tenth Doctor in the closing moments of Episode 13, “The Parting of the Ways.” But why did Eccleston quit in the first place?\n\nRelated: When Does Doctor Who Season 1/Series 14 Come Out?\n\nThe BBC initially claimed that Eccleston walked away from Doctor Who to avoid being typecast. However, this wasn’t really the case and the broadcaster later publically admitted that it hadn’t consulted Eccleston before issuing its statement about his departure. Eccleston has since revealed that he left Doctor Who because he “could not get along with the senior people”. The star added that he “left because of politics.” “I didn’t like the culture that had grown up around the series,” Eccleston explained. “So I left, I felt, over a principle.” The BBC didn’t respond to Eccleston’s comments.\n\nWill Christopher Eccleston Ever Return to Doctor Who?\n\nDon’t count on it. Eccleston has already turned down at least one offer to reprise the Ninth Doctor role. He declined to take part in 2013’s 50th anniversary special “The Day of the Doctor.” Eccleston’s also made it very clear he has zero interest in reuniting with showrunner Russell T Davies and executive producers Jane Tranter, Phil Collinson, and Julie Gardner. The quartet oversaw the Doctor Who revival from 2005-2010 and returned to shepherd the show once more in 2023, and are presumably the “senior people” Eccleston previously referred to.\n\nRelated: Doctor Who: Who Is Ncuti Gatwa’s New Companion?\n\nIndeed, Eccleston seemingly erased any doubt that clashes between him and Davies and Co. prompted his Doctor Who exit at 2023 fan event. Asked what it would take for him to mount a Doctor Who comeback, Eccleston replied that the BBC needs to fire Davies, Tranter, Collinson, and Gardner first. That’s not likely to happen any time soon, though. Davies is locked in for several more Doctor Who seasons, so Eccleston’s return remains unlikely. That said, recent Doctor Who installments have included subtle callbacks to the Ninth Doctor, including 60th anniversary special “Wild Blue Yonder.”\n\nDoctor Who Season 1/Series 14 premieres on Disney+ on May 10, 2024."
