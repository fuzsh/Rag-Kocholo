        "text": "For other uses, see Christopher (disambiguation).\n\nChristopherPronunciationGenderMaleLanguage(s)EnglishOriginLanguage(s)GreekMeaningChrist-bearerOther namesNickname(s)Chris, Kit, TopherRelated names\n\nChristopher is the English version of a Europe-wide name derived from the Greek name Χριστόφορος (Christophoros or Christoforos). The constituent parts are Χριστός (Christós), \"Christ\" or \"Anointed\", and φέρειν (phérein), \"to bear\";[1] hence the \"Christ-bearer\".\n\nAs a given name, 'Christopher' has been in use since the 10th century. In English, Christopher may be abbreviated as \"Chris\", \"Topher\", and sometimes \"Kit\". It was frequently the most popular male first name in the United Kingdom, having been in the top twenty in England and Wales from the 1940s until 1995, although it has since dropped out of the top 100. The name is most common in England and not so common in Wales, Scotland, or Ireland.[2]\n\nPeople with the given name\n\n[edit]\n\nAntiquity and Middle Ages\n\n[edit]\n\nSaint Christopher (died 251), saint venerated by Catholics and Orthodox Christians\n\nChristopher (Domestic of the Schools) (fl. 870s), Byzantine general\n\nChristopher Lekapenos (died 931), Byzantine co-emperor\n\nChristopher of Antioch (died 967), Greek Orthodox patriarch of Antioch\n\nChristopher I of Denmark (1219–1259), King of Denmark (1252–1259)\n\nChristopher II of Denmark (1276–1332), King of Denmark (1320–1326, 1329–1332)\n\nChristopher of Bavaria (1416–1448), union king of Denmark (1440–1448) as Christopher III, Sweden (1441–1448), and Norway (1442–1448)\n\nChristopher of Werle (died 1425), Prince of the Wends\n\nChristopher Columbus (1451–1506), Italian navigator, explorer, and colonizer who captained the first European ship to reach the Americas\n\nModern\n\n[edit]\n\nChristopher (singer) (born 1992), Danish singer\n\nChristopher, Count of Oldenburg (c. 1504 – 1566)\n\nChristopher, Duke of Brunswick-Harburg (1570–1606)\n\nChristopher, Duke of Mecklenburg (1537–1592)\n\nChristopher of Greece and Denmark (1888–1940), prince, son of George I, King of Greece\n\nChristopher Ross (1931-2023), American sculptor, designer and collector\n\nChristopher of Prague (born 1953), primate-elect of the Church of the Czech Lands and Slovakia\n\nChristopher Abbott (born 1986), American actor\n\nChristopher J.
