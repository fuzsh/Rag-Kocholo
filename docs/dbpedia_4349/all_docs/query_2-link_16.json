        "text": "What do you miss most when you are away?\n\nThe drinking culture. There’s a very relaxed attitude to alcohol and most of the bars in the French Quarter are always open. New Orleans is the birthplace of jazz too, so the depth of music everywhere you go, whether it’s breakfast, lunch or dinner time, is extraordinary.\n\nThe French Quarter (Fotolia/AP)\n\nWhat’s the first thing you do when you arrive?\n\nGo to the French Quarter for champagne and oysters at Napoleon House (001 504 524 9752; napoleonhouse.com) then on to Central Grocery and Deli (504 523 1620) on Decatur Street for a muffuletta, which is a huge Sicilian-style sandwich.\n\n• New Orleans - America's maddest, most extraordinary city\n\nWhere is the best place to stay?\n\nThere are a lot of central places to stay in the French Quarter but I’d recommend Omni Royal Orleans Hotel (504 529 5333; omnihotels.com), which is right in the middle of the city.\n\nWhere would you meet friends for a drink?\n\nCoop’s Bar (504 525 9053; coopsplace.net). It’s got quite a history. When I’m in America I love having rye whiskey and because of the heat in New Orleans I always start with a cold beer.\n\nJackson Square, New Orleans (Fotolia/AP)\n\nYour favourite place for lunch?\n\nPort of Call (504 523 0120; portofcallnola.com) is a fantastic‑looking building. I used to go there on a Sunday afternoon for a burger and it’s a very lively, typical New Orleans place.\n\nAnd for dinner?\n\nChartres House (504 586 8383; chartreshouse.com) is great. It’s where I’d usually start my night out. It serves both Cajun and Creole food.\n\n• Read more: New Orleans - the unseen side of the city\n\nWhere would you send a first‑time visitor?\n\nOne of the great things about New Orleans locals is their support of American football teams. There was a period when the Saints (504 733 0255; neworleanssaints.com), the city’s team, could not win any matches, so the fans took to wearing brown paper bags on their heads. But in 2009 they won the Super Bowl which, considering what had happened to the city, brought an outpouring of joy and emotion. I was there around the time it happened and it was extraordinary to witness.\n\nThe New Orleans Saints (Fotolia/AP)\n\nWhere would you tell them to avoid?\n\nI’m sure things are a lot better now, but when I was there immediately post-Katrina a lot of the local population had decamped to Austin in Texas. A large element of the criminal fraternity remained so I was cautioned by a couple of people to avoid certain areas and not spend too much time walking the streets at night. But the area at the heart of the devastation, the Lower Ninth, has been revitalised now so I’d advise people to go down there and witness the resilience of the people.\n\nNightlife in New Orleans (Fotolia/AP)\n\nPublic transport or taxi?\n\nBeing an actor, I’m a big fan of Tennessee Williams who wrote A Streetcar Named Desire, so when you’re in the French Quarter you must experience a streetcar. I don’t use cabs much. But whenever I go to a city I do try to explore it on my feet. It’s the best way to do it.\n\nManbag or money belt?\n\nWhen I went it was not the safest place, but it’s like any big city in the western world. You’ve got to be careful so I would say a money belt particularly in a tourist area because you could be targeted. But I wouldn’t want to give the place a bad reputation because it’s my favourite city in America by far.\n\nSt Louis Cathedral (Fotolia/AP)\n\nWhat should I bring home?\n\nI’d say the brown paper bag because it really expresses the New Orleanians’ sense of humour about themselves.\n\nAnywhere that isn’t your kind of town?\n\nI’ve never been but I must say that Las Vegas has absolutely no appeal for me whatsoever. It sounds like my idea of hell."
