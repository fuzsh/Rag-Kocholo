        "text": "Christopher Origin and Meaning\n\nThe name Christopher is a boy's name of Greek origin meaning \"bearer of Christ\".\n\nChristopher derived from the Greek Christophoros, which is composed of the elements Christos, referring to Christ, and phero, meaning \"to bear.\"\n\nThe name was originally used figuratively, to represent the bearing of Christ in one’s heart. Later it became used to honor Saint Christopher, a third century martyr who became the protective saint of travelers, reflecting the legend of Christopher being the giant who carried the Christ Child over a river.\n\nChristopher is an evergreen classic that dropped from Top 25 status in 2013, in spite of its appealingly strong, sincere, straightforward image, combined with a softer, more modern sound than, say, Robert or Richard.\n\nThe name appeals to a wide range of parents, and has been chosen by several celebrities, including Sean \"Diddy\" Combs.\n\nThe almost ubiquitous American nickname is Chris, but a more recent one is Topher, and there are British variations that might add a more individual spin to the name—Kit, Kip and Christy. Two Christophers known to every schoolchild: Christopher Columbus and Christopher Robin."
