So great!\n\nAs for Christopher Eccleston, I don't think he did anything at the Old Vic since 2005.\n\nRe: Ecclestone Doing Something at the Old Vic ?\n\nMaybe he was just in the area, or visiting a collegue who was at the Old Vic?\n\nIf you saw Catherine Tate at the same time we might have a story for the tabloids\n\nAs far as getting autographs, photos etc goes it never clicks in time with me and I don't really want to bother people who are just people after all.\n\nI saw Michael Palin once. Now there's a guy I would have asked for a photo if I'd realised.\n\nRe: Ecclestone Doing Something at the Old Vic ?\n\nI'm the same really. Walked past Dolph Lundgren in Geneva once, and saw Anthony Stewart Head in Stratford, just sitting in the park having a picnic with his family. Really wasn't the right moment to go and ask for an autograph...and I'm not sure I'd have the nerve either!\n\nRe: Ecclestone Doing Something at the Old Vic ?\n\nYou hate them both, why bother you troll.\n\nHave you read the board rules lately? If you feel someone is a troll, simply use the notify button to alert the mods and they can handle the matter. Since you're apparently new here, consider this a \"friendly\" reminder to refresh yourself with the aforementioned rules.\n\nThey're fan-TAS-tic.\n\nRe: Ecclestone Doing Something at the Old Vic ?\n\nLet's hope Chris doesn't put Gillian off doing Who (if she is in contention, I know it's probably just media twaddle at the moment)\n\nIf she was to ask him about it he'd probably just stomp out of the room anyway.\n\n(I wonder if he still insists on a \"No Doctor Who questions\" clause when he does interviews?)\n\nRe: Ecclestone Doing Something at the Old Vic ?\n\nI really wonder why that is, to tell the truth. Why won't he take Doctor Who questions? I've never gotten the impression that he dislikes the franchise. But, probably just the way he got screwed by the Beeb in the press. Think maybe he's just trying to avoid speaking ill of the BBC, as a professional?\n\nRe: Ecclestone Doing Something at the Old Vic ?\n\nThat's a good point! He could just be trying to put it behind him as \"just another acting part\". But, that's a shame, and a bit short-sighted if you ask me. Chris will never be Tom Cruise, Hugh Grant, or Brad Pitt. He's never going to be one of the \"great\" Hollywood leading men. So, if he keeps burning bridges like this, he'll just be one of those actors that just fade away at some point as time goes on. Maybe that's what he wants, I don't know. I don't think the pinnacle of an acting career means being any of the Hollywood guys I listed. Still it's a certain measure of popular success. If nothing else, I think it would be wiser for him to at least keep some peripheral ties to a lasting franchise like Doctor Who than to just be out there on his on.\n\nConventions will still be happening when you retire, Chris! Don't forget us! We pay well!\n\nRe: Ecclestone Doing Something at the Old Vic ?\n\nI really wonder why that is, to tell the truth. Why won't he take Doctor Who questions?

Think maybe he's just trying to avoid speaking ill of the BBC, as a professional?\n\nPretty much, I think. - and, as with Harrison Ford's mythical hatred of Star Wars, he just doesn't want that one show to be the only thing interviewers ask him about.\n\nHe doesn't mind polite fans talking to him about it, AFAIK\n\nRe: Ecclestone Doing Something at the Old Vic ?\n\nThat's a good point!

It's just that he has a vivid and diverse career and he doesn't want Doctor Who to overshadow his other work."
