        "text": "You can read more about the classic Doctor episodes at BBC here. This site is a fan site and is in no way official or associated with the BBC.\n\nBefore I go on, let me just quickly address one small controversy. Doctor Who or Dr. Who? Both are correct. At various times the TV show credits have listed not only Doctor Who and Dr. Who but The Doctor with no Who. 🙂 So if someone gives you grief, point them to Google. 🙂\n\nTheir Tenure\n\nHere is a list of the actors who previously portrayed the good Doctor, current as of October 2022, giving the years they portrayed the Doctor.\n\nJohn Hurt’s regeneration of the Doctor is the cause of the destruction of Gallifrey in one timeline. This does not happen, but he cannot remember the changed timeline. As Steven Moffat has said the numbering of the Doctors remains the same, I have numbered John Hurt’s War Doctor as #8.5. This is not official.\n\nThen there was #14. David Tennant reprises his role as the Doctor, taking over from Jodie Whitaker. It remains to be seen how things progress to #15 who has already been announced and if the numbering system will be as I’ve noted it here today.\n\n#1 – William Hartnell (Nov 1963- Oct 66)\n\n*side note: After William Hartnell died, two actors portrayed the first doctor. Richard Hurndall (in The Five Doctors) and David Bradley (in The Doctor Falls and Twice Upon a Time)\n\n#2 – Patrick Troughton (Nov 1966 – June 69)\n\n#3 – Jon Pertwee (Jan 1970 – June 74)\n\n#4 – Tom Baker (Dec 1974 – March 81)\n\n#5 – Peter Davison (Jan 1982 – March 84)\n\n#6 – Colin Baker (March 1984 – Dec 86)\n\n#7 – Sylvester McCoy (Sept 1987- Dec 89)\n\n#8 – Paul McGann (May 1996)\n\n#8.5 John Hurt the War Doctor (May 2013-Nov 2013)\n\n#9 – Christopher Eccleston (March to June 2005)\n\n#10 – David Tennant (Nov 2005- Jan 2010)\n\n#11 – Matt Smith (April 2010 – December 2013)\n\n#12 – Peter Capaldi (December 2013 – December 2017)\n\n#13 – Jodie Whittaker (December 2017 – October 2022 )\n\n#14 – David Tennant (October 2022 – ? Supposed last appearance in Dec 2023)\n\n#15 – Ncuti Gatwa (Dec 2023 – )\n\nIn “Fugitive of the Judoon” a new Doctor was introduced but I don’t know yet where this Doctor fits in. When more is known I’ll add the pertinent information.\n\n#?? – Jo Martin as Ruth Clayton/ The Doctor – (January 2020)\n\nNumber of Episodes per Doctor\n\nThe episode count is my own and also not official. I count main series and do not count mini-episodes and guest appearances in other doctor’s series unless noted. The first classic episodes were shorter than today’s episodes. Each classic series episode was approximately 25 minutes of transmission length in 1963-64 and 1986-89), was approximately 45 minutes in 1984 and from 2005 to the present. There were also additional specials at various lengths.\n\nDoctors #1, 2 and 3 appeared in The Three Doctors (part of S10 of Pertwee’s series) and Doctors #1-5 appeared in The Five Doctors (20th anniversary special during Davison’s series) with Hurndall replacing Hartnell who had died . Doctor #1 as played by David Bradley appears in The Doctor Falls and Twice Upon a Time.\n\n#1 – William Hartnell 134 episodes\n\n#2 – Patrick Troughton 119 episodes\n\n#3 – Jon Pertwee 128 episodes\n\n#4 – Tom Baker 172 episodes (173 if you count SHADA)\n\n#5 – Peter Davison 69 episodes (inc The Five Doctors 20th anniv special)\n\n#6 – Colin Baker 31 episodes\n\n#7 – Sylvester McCoy 42 episodes\n\n#8 – Paul McGann 1 movie (I have to note the important mini-episode The Night of the Doctor featuring the regeneration scene)\n\n#8.5 John Hurt the War Doctor 1 episode The Day of the Doctor, 50th-anniversary special, and mini-episode The Night of the Doctor\n\n#9 – Christopher Eccleston 13 episodes\n\n#10 – David Tennant 47 episodes (39 eps and 8 specials, 2 animated not counted), episodes as #14 will be counted separately\n\n#11 – Matt Smith 44 episodes (39 eps and 5 specials)\n\n#12 – Peter Capaldi 40 episodes (36 eps and 4 specials)\n\n#13 – Jodie Whittaker 31 (26 episodes, 5 specials) (Note: filming during pandemic)\n\n#14 – David Tennant 3 specials in 2023\n\n#15 – Ncuti Gatwa\n\nFirst and Last Episodes\n\n#1 – William Hartnell – first An Unearthly Child, last The Tenth Planet\n\n#2 – Patrick Troughton – first The Power of the Daleks, last The War Games\n\n#3 – Jon Pertwee – first Spearhead from Space, last Planet of the Spiders\n\n#4 – Tom Baker – first Robot, last Logopolis\n\n#5 – Peter Davison – first Castrovalva, last Caves of Androzani\n\n#6 – Colin Baker – first The Twin Dilemma, last The Ultimate Foe\n\n#7 – Sylvester McCoy – first Time and the Rani, last Doctor Who the Movie\n\n#8 – Paul McGann – Doctor Who (the movie), appeared in mini-episode Night of the Doctor\n\n#8.5 John Hurt (The War Doctor) – first The Night of the Doctor mini-episode, first complete episode The Name of the Doctor, last Day of the Doctor\n\n#9 – Christopher Eccleston – first Rose, last Parting of the Ways\n\n#10 – David Tennant – first The Christmas Invasion, last The End of Time\n\n#11 – Matt Smith – first The Eleventh Hour, last Christmas Special: Time of the Doctor\n\n#12 – Peter Capaldi – first Time of the Doctor, last Christmas Special: Twice Upon a Time\n\n#13 – Jodie Whittaker – first The Woman Who Fell to Earth, last The Power of the Doctor\n\n#14 – David Tennant – first as #14 The Power of the Doctor, last? in The Giggle\n\n#15 – Ncuti Gatwa – first in The Giggle,\n\nFirst words\n\n#1 – “What are you doing here?”\n\n#2- “Slower!

The brontosaurus is large and placid.”\n\n#5 – Ah. You’ve come to help me find the Zero Room. Welcome aboard. I’m the Doctor. Or will be if this regeneration works out.”\n\n#6 – “You were expecting someone else?”\n\n#7 – “Oh no, Mel.” “That was a nice nap. Now down to business.”\n\n#8 – “Who am I? Who am I?”\n\n#8.5 – “Doctor no more.”\n\n#9 – “Run!”\n\n#10 – “Hello! Okay. Ooh. New teeth. That’s weird. So, where was I? Oh, that’s right. Barcelona!”\n\n#11 – “Legs! I’ve still got legs!! Good. Arms, hands. Ooh, fingers. Lots of fingers. Ears? Yes. Eyes: too. Nose. I’ve had worse. Chin – blimey! Hair. I’m a girl! No! No! I’m not a girl! And still not ginger! There’s something else. Something… important, I’m… I’m..I’m… Ha-ha! Crashing! haha Woohoohoo Geronimo!”\n\n#12 – “Kidneys! I’ve got new kidneys! I don’t like the colour. …We’re probably crashing! Ohh! Stay calm. Just one question: Do you happen to know how to fly this thing?”\n\n#13 – “Oh! Brilliant!”\n\n#14 – “I know these teeth. What? What? What?”\n\n#15 – “No way!”\n\nLast words\n\n#1 – William Hartnell “Ah, yes! It’s good! Thank you. Keep warm.”\n\nDavid Bradley in “Twice Upon a Time” … Well, then. Here we go. The long way around.”\n\n#2 – “No! Stop, you’re making me giddy! No, you can’t do this to me! No, no, no, no, no, no …”\n\n#3 – “A tear, Sarah Jane? No, don’t cry. While there’s life there’s …”\n\n#4 – “It’s the end. But the moment has been prepared for.”\n\n#5 – “I might regenerate. I don’t know. Feels different this time … Adric?”\n\n#6 – “Ohh… carrot juice?

I’ve got to stop…him.” (regeneration in 1996 movie)\n\nIn last aired episode of the original series (Survival) – “There are worlds out there where the sky is burning. And the sea’s asleep, and the rivers dream. People made of smoke, and cities made of song. Somewhere there’s danger. Somewhere there’s injustice. And somewhere else, the tea’s getting cold. Come on, Ace — we’ve got work to do!”\n\n#8 – “Physician, heal thyself.”\n\n#8.5 – “Wearing a bit thin. I hope the ears are a bit less conspicuous this time.”\n\n#9 – “Rose, before I go I just wanna tell you, you were fantastic. Absolutely fantastic. And do you know what? So was I!”\n\n#10 – “I don’t want to go.”\n\n#11 – “We all change. When you think about it, we’re all different people, all through our lives. And that’s okay, that’s good, you gotta keep moving, so long as you remember all the people that you used to be. I will not forget one line of this, not one day. I swear. I will always remember when the Doctor was me.”\n\n#12 – “Doctor, I let you go.” (Ending of a long speech in Twice Upon Time)\n\nLong speech:\n\n“There it is. Silly old universe. The more I save it, the more it needs saving. The treadmill. Yes,yes I know they’ll get it all wrong without me. Well, I suppose, one more lifetime won’t kill anyone. Well, except me. You in a moment, Doctor. Let’s get it right. I’ve got a few things to say to you. Basic stuff first. Never be cruel, never be cowardly, and never ever eat pears. Remember… hate is always foolish. Love is always wise. Always try to be nice. Never fail to be kind. Oh, and you mustn’t tell anyone your name. No one will understand it anyway except, except children. Children can hear it sometimes if their hearts are in the right place and the stars are, too. Children can hear your name. But nobody else.. nobody else ever.\n\nLaugh hard. Run fast. Be kind. Doctor…I let you go.”\n\n#13 – “Tag, you’re it!”\n\nLong version: The blossomiest blossom. That’s the only sad thing. I wanna know what happens next. Right then. Doctor-whoever-I’m-about-tobe. Tag, you’re it!\n\n#14 – Didn’t die due to bi-generation.
