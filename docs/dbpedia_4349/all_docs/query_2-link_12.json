        "text": "Christopher Eccleston has said that straight white men are “quite rightly” seeing acting opportunities “shrink” nowadays.\n\nThe Doctor Who star recently appeared in the Channel 4 series Close To Me and stars opposite Lenny Henry in My Name is Leon, a one-off BBC drama about a nine-year-old mixed-race child living within the care system in the Eighties.\n\nBut appearing on 5Live on Thursday (9 June), Eccleston told Nihal Arthanayake that he was struggling with his career.\n\n“Quite rightly, I’m a dinosaur now,” the 58-year-old said. “I’m white, I’m middle-aged, I’m male and I’m straight. We are the new pariah in the industry.\n\n“We’re all seen through the lens of Harvey Weinstein et al and I can feel that the opportunities are shrinking, as they should do. I’ve lived off the fat of the land for 30 years in my career.”\n\nHe continued: “But I still have to pay my mortgage, I still have to support my kids. So I don’t welcome the uncertainty at all… the unpredictability was far more welcome to a younger person.”\n\nElsewhere in the interview, Eccleston said that he “felt like a failure” and was “very disappointed” with the way his career had gone.\n\nWith Arthanayake sounding incredulous at these comments, Eccleston explained: “In the Nineties, I had two incredible film roles: Jude in Jude the Obscure and Derek Bentley in Let Him Have It… I fell short in both those performances. Those were my chances to really, really hit it and have far more influence and control over the kind of stuff I did.”\n\nHe added that he was “not finished yet”.\n\nMy Name is Leon airs on Friday 10 June at 9pm on BBC Two."
