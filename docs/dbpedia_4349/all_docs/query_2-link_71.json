        "text": "Hello everyone! 🙂\n\nWelcome to ‘Bradley’s Basement’ blog and I’m Tim Bradley!\n\nLast Friday, I saw the film ‘Young Woman and the Sea’, which has been released on Disney+. The film stars Daisy Ridley, well-known for playing Rey in the ‘Star Wars’ sequel trilogy, as Trudy Ederle, an American competitive swimmer. She became the first woman to swim across the English Channel. 🙂 Continue reading →\n\nHello everyone! 🙂\n\nWelcome to ‘Bradley’s Basement’ blog and I’m Tim Bradley!\n\nThe time has come for ‘The Day of the Doctor’ by Steven Moffat – the 50th anniversary special of ‘Doctor Who’. This was shown on BBC TV on the 23rd of November 2013. It stars Matt Smith as the Eleventh Doctor, David Tennant as the Tenth Doctor, Jenna Coleman as Clara Oswald, Billie Piper as the Moment and John Hurt as the War Doctor. There are special guest stars like Jemma Redgrave as Kate Stewart, Ingrid Oliver as Osgood and Joanna Page as Queen Elizabeth I. The story also features the Daleks as well as the return of the Zygons, who previously appeared in their first TV story ‘Terror of the Zygons’. There are surprise guest cameos of Doctors and companions that a keen ‘Doctor Who’ fan would need to look out for. 😀 This is a ‘Doctor Who’ anniversary special that’s highly rated by the fans. Do I agree with that? Do I think that this is a better anniversary special than ‘The Five Doctors’, the 20th anniversary special? Does it cover everything that I want to celebrate about 50 years of my favourite TV show? Are there things that I like about ‘The Day of the Doctor’? 😀 ‘The Day of the Doctor’ can be checked out on DVD, Blu-ray and BBC iPlayer. Continue reading →\n\nHello everyone! 🙂\n\nWelcome to ‘Bradley’s Basement’ blog and I’m Tim Bradley!\n\nWe close our look into the Christopher Eccleston/Ninth Doctor era of ‘Doctor Who’ by checking out the first collection of Big Finish audios in Series 2 of ‘The Ninth Doctor Adventures’ called ‘Back to Earth’. This is following on from me checking out Series 1 of ‘The Ninth Doctor Adventures’ in 2022, including anthologies like ‘Ravagers’, ‘Respond to All Calls’, ‘Lost Warriors’ and ‘Old Friends’. For this year, I’ll only be checking out ‘Back to Earth’ in Series 2 of ‘The Ninth Doctor Adventures’. I’m hoping that I will catch up on more ‘Ninth Doctor Adventures’ by Big Finish soon in 2024. Continue reading →\n\nHello everyone! 🙂\n\nWelcome to ‘Bradley’s Basement’ blog and I’m Tim Bradley!\n\nIt’s a shame that Christopher Eccleston only did one season of the new ‘Doctor Who’ TV series when it began in 2005. His era as the Ninth Doctor is one of the most significant of the TV show’s history, especially with resurrecting ‘Doctor Who’ back on TV and to be played for contemporary audiences. Continue reading →\n\nHello everyone! 🙂\n\nWelcome to ‘Bradley’s Basement’ blog and I’m Tim Bradley!\n\nThe first and only season of the Christopher Eccleston/Ninth Doctor era of ‘Doctor Who’ is undeniably a significant season in the history of the TV show. After sixteen years of being off-air from TV screens, ‘Doctor Who’ returned triumphantly in its new series under Russell T. Davies’ reign. Continue reading →\n\nHello everyone! 🙂\n\nWelcome to ‘Bradley’s Basement’ blog and I’m Tim Bradley!\n\nAnd thus, we’ve come to the end of Series 1 of the new ‘Doctor Who’ TV series as well as the end of the Christopher Eccleston/Ninth Doctor era. It’s time for the two-part finale ‘Bad Wolf’/’The Parting of the Ways’ by Russell T. Davies, starring Christopher Eccleston as the Ninth Doctor, Billie Piper as Rose Tyler and John Barrowman as Captain Jack Harkness. In this ‘Doctor Who’ adventure, our heroes find themselves back aboard Satellite 5, which has now become the Game Station. They have to play deadly versions of TV game shows like ‘Big Brother’, ‘The Weakest Link’ and ‘What Not To Wear’. Can the TARDIS trio survive the games as well as the return of the Daleks who are about to attack the planet Earth in the year 200,100? ‘Bad Wolf’/’The Parting of the Ways’ can be checked out on DVD, Blu-ray and BBC iPlayer. Continue reading →\n\nHello everyone! 🙂\n\nWelcome to ‘Bradley’s Basement’ blog and I’m Tim Bradley!\n\nLet’s check out another one of my favourite ‘Doctor Who’ stories from the Christopher Eccleston/Ninth Doctor era. This is the penultimate story in Series 1 of the new ‘Doctor Who’ TV series called ‘Boom Town’ by Russell T. Davies. In this ‘Doctor Who’ adventure, Christopher Eccleston as the Doctor, Billie Piper as Rose and John Barrowman as Captain Jack visit Cardiff Bay in South Wales. They reunite with Noel Clarke as Mickey and enjoy spending some time in Cardiff Bay before they discover Annette Badland as Margaret Blaine, one of the Slitheen from ‘Aliens of London’/’World War Three’ has returned to cause trouble. Will our bunch of heroes stop Margaret the Slitheen? ‘Boom Town’ can be checked out on DVD, Blu-ray and BBC iPlayer. Continue reading →\n\nHello everyone! 🙂\n\nWelcome to ‘Bradley’s Basement’ blog and I’m Tim Bradley!\n\nHere’s the second two-part adventure in Series 1 of the new ‘Doctor Who’ TV series. It’s also the first two-parter penned by Steven Moffat, and it’s one of my favourite ‘Doctor Who’ stories from the Christopher Eccleston/Ninth Doctor era. Starring Christopher Eccleston as the Ninth Doctor and Billie Piper as Rose Tyler, the TARDIS duo travel back in time to the year 1941 on Earth where London is at the height of the Blitz. They meet John Barrowman as Captain Jack Harkness, who eventually joins them as a TARDIS traveller. The trio have to thwart the menace of the gas mask zombies who keep asking “Are you my Mummy?” Can they solve the mystery of what’s going on with these zombies? ‘The Empty Child’/’The Doctor Dances’ can be checked out on DVD, Blu-ray and BBC iPlayer. Continue reading →\n\nHello everyone! 🙂\n\nWelcome to ‘Bradley’s Basement’ blog and I’m Tim Bradley!\n\nIt’s time for an emotional ‘Doctor Who’ episode in the new TV series called ‘Father’s Day’ by Paul Cornell. This was my first discovery of Paul Cornell’s writing in ‘Doctor Who’ before checking out ‘Circular Time’ and ‘Goth Opera’, both featuring the Fifth Doctor and Nyssa. In ‘Father’s Day’, Christopher Eccelston as the Ninth Doctor takes Billie Piper as Rose Tyler back in time to the day where her father, Shaun Dingwall as Pete Tyler, died in London in 1987. Rose inadvertently saves her dad’s life, causing the Reapers to be unleashed as they attempt to ‘sterilise the wound’. Does this incident damage the Doctor and Rose’s relationship? Will Pete Tyler learn the truth that Rose is his daughter. ‘Father’s Day’ can be checked out on DVD, Blu-ray and BBC iPlayer. Continue reading →\n\nHello everyone! 🙂\n\nWelcome to ‘Bradley’s Basement’ blog and I’m Tim Bradley!\n\nWe’re halfway through Series 1 of the new ‘Doctor Who’ TV series and it’s time to check out another episode starring Christopher Eccleston as the Ninth Doctor and Billie Piper as Rose. In this episode, they’re joined by Bruno Langley as Adam Mitchell, who previously appeared in ‘Dalek’. Sadly, Adam has a short time in the TARDIS. This ‘Doctor Who’ episode is called ‘The Long Game’ by Russell T. Davies. It takes place in the year 200,000, as the TARDIS trio visit Satellite 5, a space station that broadcasts the world’s news to the people of planet Earth. But something deadly lurks on Floor 500, as the planet Earth is being manipulated by Simon Pegg as the mysterious Editor and his boss: the Mighty Jagrafess. ‘The Long Game’ can be checked out on DVD, Blu-ray and BBC iPlayer.
