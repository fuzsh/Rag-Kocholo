And I can feel that the opportunities are shrinking.\n\nREAD MORE:Julie Andrews hasn't aged a day but Sound of Music kids unrecognisable\n\n“As they should do.”\n\nThe Ninth Doctor added that he has “lived off the fat of the land” for several decades, but the new uncertainty in his career has caused him to worry.\n\nHe went on: “I still have to pay my mortgage, I still have to support my kids, so I don't welcome the uncertainty at all.”\n\nIn a separate interview, Christopher added that he sees himself as a \"failure\" because of how his career has turned out.\n\nInvalid email\n\nWe use your sign-up to provide content in ways you've consented to and to improve our understanding of you.
