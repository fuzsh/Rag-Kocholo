        "text": "A Doctor Who star has claimed an A-list actress accused him of touching her inappropriately on set.\n\nChristopher Eccleston, 59, played the ninth Doctor in the hit BBC series. He is currently starring alongside his \"childhood crush\" Jodie Foster in thriller True Detective, which is inspired by a horrifying mystery. The pair play \"friends with benefits\" and Christopher has praised True Detective's intimacy coordinator.\n\nThe actor has said he felt protected during the sex scenes, unlike in a previous job. \"I did a sex scene with an A-list actress – not Nicole Kidman, who was brilliant – and she implied, in front of the crew, that I was copping a feel because she didn’t like me,\" he said.\n\nSpeaking to The Independent, Christopher admitted he was thankful the incident happened before the Harvey Weinstein \"stuff came to light\". He felt the accusation could have caused the end of his career. Christopher added: \"I’ve never felt more betrayed by a fellow actor than I did that day. I have to say to you that I would sooner have put my hands in a food blender than copped a feel of that person.\"\n\nHe believes it would not have happened if there was an intimacy coordinator on set, and claims it was an \"abuse of power\". Christopher took on the role as the Doctor back in 2005 when the show made its much anticipated comeback. He was the first actor to take on the character who was not born when the series first began.\n\nDue to his successful comeback, there was a shock when it was announced he was leaving at the end of the series after just two months in the role. His exit was shrouded in mystery and controversy, with the BBC admitting they had falsely attributed a leaving statement to him without his consent.\n\nThey also confessed to breaking the agreement made to not publicly disclose he was only doing one series. Christopher claimed his relationship with showrunner Russel T. Davies and some of his producers had broken down \"irreparably\" during the first block of filming and never recovered.\n\n\"They lost trust in me, and I lost faith and trust and belief in them,\" he said. He went on to appear on stage at the Old Vic theatre and star in TV dramas, The Leftovers, Blackout and The A World. The actor also played villain Malekith in Thor sequel The Dark World.\n\nChristopher recently opened up about his mental health, admitting he almost \"lost everything\". He was hospitalised with severe clinical depression and has candidly discussed the moments he reached his lowest point. Speaking with Plymouth-based Big Issue magazine vendor Clive - a publication the actor is an ambassador for - Christopher said: \"There was one night I thought I was going to die.\n\n\"I was running down Euston Road with a suitcase. Now, if anybody has seen me they'd have gone, 'Oh, there's Doctor Who'. My point is, I don't think people understand how quickly it can happen. Particularly in times of economic recession.\" He admitted he \"broke down\" and experienced a mental health episode while he was filming for the first series of The A Word on BBC, which aired in 2016."
