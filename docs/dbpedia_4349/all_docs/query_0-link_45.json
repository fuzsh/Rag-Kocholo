        "text": "Former Doctor Who actor Christopher Eccleston will feature in a Cold War film produced in Guernsey.\n\nEccleston will voice East German radio presenter Herbert Köfer in Whispers of Freedom, a true story about the last person shot trying to escape to West Germany across the Berlin Wall.\n\nThe short film is being produced by Guernsey-based Golden Goat Films and is due to be shot in Guernsey, Berlin and London.\n\nCameron Ashplant, who is also starring in the film, said it was \"amazing to be working with Chris on a Guernsey film\".\n\n\"It's great to have such talent interested in the Guernsey film scene and bringing attention from international media on Guernsey films,\" he said.\n\nThe short film follows the story of Chris Gueffroy, a waiter who tried to flee East Germany after he discovered he was being conscripted to the army.\n\nThe film's director, Brandon Ashplant, said he was \"delighted\" when he discovered Eccleston was interested in the role and had a \"short window of availability\".\n\nMr Ashplant said Eccleston brought \"gravitas\" to the role of Köfer, which was based on one of East Germany's \"few high-profile\" celebrities.\n\nHe said the film would be shown at film festivals once it was completed next year, and would have a premiere in Guernsey \"later in the year\"."
