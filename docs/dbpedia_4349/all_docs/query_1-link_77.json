        "text": "Right, time for something different I think.\n\nYes, I could just grab every film I watched over the past 31 days and talk about them, but where’s the fun in that? Rather, I want to try and establish links and connections between the varied films I watched, why I watched them and my random witterings. I have two essays coming up, so my choices I’ll be discussing today are connected to my mental breakdowns regarding what I’m going to be writing about and “hey, look, a Doctor Who actor!” I’m choosing the films I can talk the most about, how they’re interesting and the coincidences they share. Let’s get the ball rolling!\n\nYes, I watch foreign films\n\nContinue reading “My March Movie Madness” →\n\nIn four days time, the world will be introduced to Jodie Whittaker as the Thirteenth Doctor. I cannot wait, and I eagerly anticipate this new era. Following an era that- Series 10 and the beauty that it is aside- I couldn’t enjoy as much as I usually do, to have a fresh new start with a new Doctor, new companions and a new showrunner is simply glorious. The Woman Who Fell to Earth is the first episode for the Thirteenth Doctor, and it’s important to have a good first impression. Whilst I have faith that Chris Chibnall will give us a great first episode (although I am far more excited for the more intriguing sounding Episode 2), there has unfortunately been precedent in the past for less than stellar first stories. Let’s look back at the past twelve times we were introduced to a Doctor and see how they hold up in celebration of this upcoming era-\n\nContinue reading “Every Doctors’ first story- Which one’s the best?” →\n\nSeries 11 is coming. A new Doctor, a new era. Now is the time to look back on the brilliance of the past 13 years, which has encompassed four Doctors and ten seasons. Whilst I could discuss the best episodes, that would be harder than this list, so let’s look at the best moments of the revived show. With over a hundred episodes to choose from, picking 50 was hard. I’ve decided to limit the list to one moment per story, and to leave the quality of the episode aside to focus on the moment in question. There’s too much to go through, so I’ve split the list up-\n\nContinue reading “50 Greatest New Series scenes- Part One” →"
