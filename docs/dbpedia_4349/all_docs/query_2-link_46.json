        "text": "Though heâs most often linked to his role as the Tenth Doctor on the legendary sci-fi series Doctor Who, David Tennant is much more than that, as audiences around the world have discovered. Born David John McDonald in West Lothian, Scotland on April 18, 1971, the man who would become David Tennant has spent the past 30-plus years carving out a very particular niche for himselfâboth on the stage and screen in England and, increasingly more, as a Hollywood staple. To celebrate the star's 50th birthday, here are 15 things you might not know about David Tennant.\n\n1. David Tennant took his name from the Pet Shop Boys.\n\nAs a teenager, the budding actor learned that because there was already a David McDonald in the actorsâ union, he needed to come up with an alternate moniker to pursue a professional acting career. Right around the same time, he read an interview in Smash Hits with Neil Tennant, lead vocalist for the Pet Shop Boys, and \"David Tennant\" was born.\n\nToday, he legally is David Tennant. âI am now actually Tennantâhave been for a few years,â he said in 2013. âIt was an issue with the Screen Actors' Guild in the U.S., who wouldn't let me keep my stage name unless it was my legal name. Faced with the prospect of working under two different names on either side of the globe, I had to take the plunge and rename myself! So although I always liked the name, I'm now more intimately associated with it than I had ever imagined. Thank you, Neil Tennant.â\n\n2. David Tennant became an actor with the specific goal of starring in Doctor Who.\n\nWhile a lot of young kids dream of growing up to become astronauts or professional athletes, Tennant set his own career goal at the tender age of three: to star on Doctor Who. It was Tom Bakerâs version of The Doctor in particular that inspired Tennant to become an actor. He carried around a Doctor Who doll and wrote Who-inspired essays at school. \"Doctor Who was a massive influence,\" Tennant told Rolling Stone. \"I think it was for everyone in my generation; growing up, it was just part of the cultural furniture in Britain in the '70s and '80s.â\n\nOn April 16, 2004, just two days before his 34th birthday, Tennant achieved that goal when he was officially named The Tenth Doctor, taking over for Christopher Eccleston. âI am delighted, excited, and honored to be the Tenth Doctor,â Tennant said at the time. âI grew up loving Doctor Who and it has been a lifelong dream to get my very own TARDIS.â\n\n3. Though becoming The Doctor was a lifelong dream for David Tennant, there was some trepidation when he was offered the role.\n\nThough landing the lead in Doctor Who was a lifelong dream come true for Tennant, the initial excitement was followed by a little trepidation. When asked by The Scotsman whether he worried about being typecast, Tennant admitted: âI did remember being thrilled to bits when I got asked and then a few days later thinking, âOh, is this a terrible idea?â â¦ But that didn't last very long. Time will tell. The only option is you don't take these jobs when they come up. You've got to just roll with the punches.â\n\n4. David Tennant made his professional debut in a PSA.\n\nWhile most actors have some early roles theyâd prefer to forget, Tennantâs first professional gig didnât come in some otherwise forgettable movie, TV series, or play. When he was 16 years old, he booked a role in an anti-smoking PSA for the Glasgow Health Board, which played on television and was shown in schools. Thanks to the power of the internet, you can watch his performance above.\n\n5. David Tennant married the Fifth Doctor's daughter, who once played the Tenth Doctor's daughter.\n\nConfused? In 2011, Tennant married Georgia Moffett, who played his artificially created daughter, Jenny, in the 2008 Doctor Who episode âThe Doctorâs Daughter.â In real life, Moffett really is The Doctorâs daughter; her father is Peter Davison, who played the Fifth Doctor from 1981 to 1984.\n\n6. David Tennant's first movie role had him acting opposite Christopher Eccleston.\n\nIn 1996, Tennant landed his first movie role in Michael Winterbottomâs Jude, where he played the very descriptive âDrunk Undergraduate.â His big scene had him acting opposite Christopher Ecclestonâthe man who, less than a decade later, would hand over the keys to the TARDIS to Tennant.\n\n7. David Tennant avoids reading reviews of his work.\n\nWhile itâs hard to imagine that Tennant has ever had to deal with too many scathing reviews, it doesnât really matter to the actor: good or bad, he avoids reading them. When asked during a livechat with The Guardian about one particularly negative review, and whether he reads and reacts to them, Tennant replied: âThe bad review to which you refer was actually for a German expressionist piece about the Round Table called Merlin. It was the first extensive review I'd ever had, and it was absolutely appalling. Not that it's scarred into my memory in any way whatsoever. I try not to read them, these days. Reviews aren't really for the people who are performing, andâgood or badâthey don't help. You always get a sense if something you're in has been well received or not, that's unavoidable. But beyond that, details are best avoided.â\n\n8. David Tennant hosted Masterpiece Theatre.\n\nIn 2007, Masterpiece Theatre reinvented itself. In addition to dropping the âTheatreâ from its title, the series announced that it was splintering into three different seasonsâMasterpiece Classic, Masterpiece Mystery!, and Masterpiece Contemporary. Unlike the days of the past, when Alistair Cooke held court, each of the new series had its own host, Tennant among them. (He was in charge of Masterpiece Contemporary.)\n\n9. David Tennant got a lot of younger audiences interested in Shakespeare.\n\nTennant has logged a lot of hours with the Royal Shakespeare Company over the years. In 2008, while still starring in Doctor Who, he took on the role that every actor wants in the RSCâs production of Hamlet, which ended up being one of Londonâs hottest (and hardest to get) tickets. The Guardian reported that hundreds of people were lined up to buy tickets, with some even camping out overnight outside the West End theater. Within three hours of the tickets going on sale, all 6000 of them were sold out.\n\nâHamlet is a very popular play,â a RSC spokesperson said at the time. âIt's the most famous. But obviously there's the factor that David Tennant is in it and the good news is that he's bringing a lot of younger audiences to Shakespeare.\"\n\n10. David Tennant was on a Royal Stamp.\n\nIn 2011, the Royal Mail paid tribute to Royal Shakespeare Companyâs 50th anniversary with a series of stamps featuring images from a handful of the RSCâs productions, including Tennant as Hamlet.\n\n11. David Tennant was considered for the role of Hannibal Lecter.\n\nThough itâs easy to see why Bryan Fuller cast Mads Mikkelsen in the title role of his television adaptation of Hannibal, Tennant came pretty close to playing the fava bean-and-chianti-loving, flesh-eating serial killer at the heart of Thomas Harrisâs novels. Fuller was so impressed with Tennantâs dark side that he tried to make a guest appearance happen during the seriesâ run.\n\nâIâm a huge fan of David Tennant, and weâve been trying to get him on the show for quite some time,â Fuller said. âHeâs such a spectacular actor. He brings such an effervescence to every performance. I would love to have David on the show. Or just write for David! I would kill and eat somebody to work with David! Heâs my favorite Doctor.â\n\n12. David Tennant is Jodie Whittaker's favorite Doctor.\n\nFuller isnât the only one who puts Tennant at the top of their Favorite Doctor list. Jodie Whittaker, who recently made her debut as the Thirteenth Doctorâand is the first woman to take on the roleâtold The Sunday Times that âDavid [is my favorite Doctor] of course, because I know him.â (The two spent three seasons co-starring in the British crime drama Broadchurch.)\n\nWhen asked about Whittakerâs casting at the New Orleans Wizard World Comic Con, and whether he had given her any words of advice, Tennant said that, âWe had a wee chat, yes. It is quite a unique job, because it's a show that has so much history to it. And it has a reach that's quite unlike other things. It's a bit of a kind of cultural thingâWho's going to be the Doctor?âit's a news story, really. So to find yourself in the middle of that is a bit overwhelming. I think inevitably, you sort of look to people who'd been there before to go, 'What is this like? What is this madness I entered into?' And that's certainly been the case with Matt and Peter, and now with Jodie. I know that Jodie's talked to Peter, and she's talked to Matt. You just for a little support group. You go, 'What is this madness? Tell me about it.' And of course, you know, she's a little trepidatious, but she's basically really excited. She's such a fantastic choice for it. You see it in just those 30 seconds that she did at the end of the last episode. You just go, 'Oh my god, she's all over it. Brilliant. It's great.ââ\n\n13. David Tennant is dying to work with Aaron Sorkin.\n\nWhen asked by Collider if thereâs ever been a television show heâs watched and wished he was a part of, Tennant copped to being a huge fan of The West Wing.\n\nâThe West Wing is finished now [but] thatâs the one that I would have loved to have been part of,\" he said. \"Iâd love to work with Aaron Sorkin on something. Just the way he writes, he has no fear in writing people that are fiercely intelligent, and I love that. I love the speed of his stuff, and the way people free-associate and interact. That kind of writing is very exciting. Itâs hard to have that kind of clarity of voice, especially in a world where thereâs a million executives listening to everything you do and having an opinion and trying to drive everything towards the lowest common denominator because thatâs what happens when things are made by committee. So, to have someone whoâs got a strong individual voice that is allowed to be heard is quite increasingly rare. These people need to be cherished.â\n\n14. David Tennant has earned a lot of fan accolades, including \"Coolest Man on TV.\"\n\nIn addition to his many professional acting accoladesâincluding a couple of BAFTAs and a Daytime Emmy and an Olivier Award nominationâTennant has earned a number of less official âawardsâ over the years. In 2007, a Radio Times survey named him the Coolest Man on TV. The National Television Awards named him Most Popular Actor of 2006, 2007, 2008, and 2010. In 2008, he was one of Cosmopolitanâs Sexiest Men in the World. In 2012, British GQ readers named him the third Best Dressed Man (behind Tom Hiddleston and Robert Pattinson).\n\n15. the royal shakespeare company once sold David Tennant's pants.\n\nOn April 17, 2018, as part of the Royal Shakespeare Companyâs Stitch in Time fundraiser, the organization auctioned off more than 50 original costumes worn during RSC performances. Among the items they had on offer? The black trousers Tennant wore in Hamlet, and the white robe he wore in Richard II.\n\nA version of this story ran in 2018; it has been updated for 2021."
