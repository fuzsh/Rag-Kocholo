        "text": "Happy birthday to Christopher Eccleston, who turns 50 today (Sunday, February 16).\n\nA stalwart of television, film and theatre, Chris has played some of television's most iconic characters (from Our Friends in the North's Nicky Hutchinson to Doctor Who's titular hero), brought life to numerous 'everyman' roles with extraordinary performances and used his work to explore themes of justice, loyalty and friendship.\n\nTo celebrate Christopher's half-century, Digital Spy has chosen ten standout performances from his film and television work, presented in chronological order. Given his acting career spans almost 25 years, a few didn't make our personal top ten, but as always, do tell us about your favourites in the comments section...\n\nShallow Grave (1994)\n\nDanny Boyle's dizzying breakthrough movie Shallow Grave not only launched the career of Ewan McGregor, it propelled Christopher Eccleston - already an established TV star - into the big league.\n\nChris's portrayal of chartered accountant David is quietly menacing from the offset, and the underlying tensions between himself, Alex (McGregor) and Juliet (Kerry Fox) are played perfectly. It's a darkly comedic character study that allows its principal cast members to show off their talent and range with ease - posing questions about trust and loyalty along the way.\n\nOur Friends in the North (1996)\n\nHailed as one of the greatest TV dramas of the decade when it first aired, Our Friends in the North's quality still shines through today - and it didn't just propel Chris's career to the next level, it also benefited his co-stars (including one Daniel Craig).\n\nEccleston's Nicky Hutchinson is introduced as an artistic, idealistic young student, and he explores his own political ideology and growing sense of activism against the backdrop of real social and political events in Newcastle and London, including the miners' strike. But the series is as much about Nicky's on-off love affair with Mary (Gina McKee). Come the final episode, you're hoping they'll heed Nicky's late mother's advice that \"tomorrow's too late\" and somehow work it out after all those years.\n\nJude (1996)\n\nAs Eccleston's star rose, so did his big-screen clout with the leading role in Jude. The period adaptation of Thomas Hardy's Jude the Obscure paired the actor not only with a young Kate Winslet, but also Michael Winterbottom - showing that he was definitely in demand with Britain's foremost filmmakers.\n\nAlso of note - David Tennant, Christopher's successor as The Doctor in Doctor Who appears in the movie credited as a 'drunk undergraduate' - and James Nesbitt also features alongside the pair in the short clip above.\n\nHillsborough (1996)\n\nChristopher Eccleston has previously been quoted as saying that Hillsborough is \"the most important piece of work I've ever done and ever will do\". He sought Trevor Hicks's blessing before accepting the part in Jimmy McGovern's emotive BAFTA-winning drama, which recalls the 1989 Hillsborough stadium disaster and the start of the bereaved families' lengthy fight for justice - and the truth about what happened that day.\n\nEccleston's rounded portrayal of Hicks, as he tries to maintain a calm and dignified public persona despite the grief, loss and anger he's clearly feeling following the death of his daughters Vicky and Sarah, ranks among his finest work. He has every reason to be proud of his portrayal, and the impact it had.\n\n28 Days Later (2002)\n\n28 Days Later is not an easy film to watch, and you could argue that some of its most harrowing scenes involve Christopher Eccleston - reunited with Danny Boyle - playing twisted army major Henry West.\n\nEccleston's Henry is soon revealed to be a threat in a very different way from the Infected, keeping a soldier who has contracted the Rage virus chained up in the yard at their compound and granting his troops licence to rape female survivors with the supposed aim of re-populating the country.\n\nMajor West's highly dubious moral judgment brings to mind 19th century writer and politician John Dalberg-Acton's often quoted words: \"Power tends to corrupt, but absolute power corrupts absolutely\". Eccleston's convincing performance - which makes you feel like his character unequivocally believes the moral framework on which he has pinned his decisions - makes Henry all the more terrifying.\n\nThe Second Coming (2003)\n\nITV took a leap of faith in 2003 when it picked up Russell T Davies's two-part drama The Second Coming. Although its writer's playful streak shines through the narrative, it's a thought-provoking piece that gets you asking questions about religion, modern media culture, friendship and betrayal.\n\nEccleston stars as Steve Baxter, an unassuming video store employee who discovers he's the Son of God, and he rightfully earned his second BAFTA nod for a magnetic performance in which Steve wrestles not only with the impact of his powers and responsibilities on society, but on his loved ones. His chemistry with Lesley Sharp, playing Steve's best friend/sometime lover Judy, is absolutely electric - particularly in the 'last supper' scene.\n\nDoctor Who (2005)\n\n\"Nice to meet you, Rose. Run for your life.\"\n\nWith those few words, we knew that Doctor Who's return was in safe hands. It may have been a brief stint in the TARDIS but oh boy, the Ninth Doctor's thirteen episodes were worth every moment.\n\nEccleston breathed fresh life into The Doctor with his action-driven, brusque and uncompromising take on the much-loved Time Lord, fitting the description \"madman with a box\" to a tee. He may not have looked like past Doctors, but his character's battered old leather coat became almost as enduring as Jon Pertwee's velvet smoking jackets, or Tom Baker's striped scarf and brown trilby.\n\nIt's a shame that Christopher was only on the show for one series - but maybe that's part of what makes his tenure so special. His verbal duel with the last Dalek in the universe - part anger, part glee, part empathy - remains one of the show's all-time highlights.\n\nAccused (2010)\n\nAnother ordinary man and another extraordinary performance from Eccleston, who reunited with Jimmy McGovern to launch his all-star courtroom drama Accused.\n\nChris's portrayal of troubled plumber and flawed family man Willy Houlihan was rewarded with an International Emmy Award for Best Actor, and it was met with a warm critical reception and audience ratings which remain the strongest across Accused's two series to date. Willy's story leaves you contemplating the uneasy relationship between money and happiness, and whether it's really possible to completely separate the two. And although Willy isn't a saint - far from it - you feel for him when he's arrested at his daughter's wedding, and so much of that is down to how Eccleston brings him to life.\n\nThe Shadow Line (2011)\n\nHugo Blick's spine-chilling, stomach-churning political thriller The Shadow Line is one of the most beautifully complex pieces of television drama to have aired in recent years, and the sense of tension and intrigue is only heightened when you realise that you can't trust anyone - especially those in authority. Its ensemble cast - with Chris at its heart alongside Rafe Spall, Stephen Rea, Kierston Wareing and Oscar nominee Chiwetel Ejiofor - all offer strong performances.\n\nOn the surface, Eccleston's character Joseph Bede is a mild-mannered florist, but he's actually a rather ruthless drugs lord who moves up the hierarchy when his boss is killed at the start of the serial. Seeing Chris reunited with his Second Coming co-star Lesley Sharp is simply wonderful, and his tender scenes with Sharp (playing Joseph's wife Julie, who has early onset Alzheimer's) offer some insight as to why Joseph may have been drawn into a life of crime in the first place - and why he wants to get out after one last job.\n\nThe Borrowers (2011)\n\nWhen Christopher Eccleston was cast as Pod Clock in the BBC's festive adaptation of The Borrowers, a few of you may well have raised your eyebrows.\n\nChristopher's Pod, by his own declaration, was a wannabe action hero experiencing something of \"a mid-life crisis\", and his fresh, energetic take on the role gave the Mary Norton classic a new lease of life for a brand new generation of families."
