        "text": "Yes!\n\nBloody working class people everywhere now!\n\nNot like the good old days when all the Doctors had posh middle class backgrounds. Like...er...William Hartnell...Tom Baker...Christopher Eccleston... ahem...\n\nDo we honestly think the series would be improved by having an all white male middle class cast?\n\nPerhaps some of us should look out the window occasionally.\n\nThe world is bigger on the outside.\n\nQuote: Rood Eye @ 21st October 2018, 9:11 PM\n\nNow I go chasing monsters to earn an honest bob.\n\nIn a left-wing liberal universe, I'm ideal for the job.\n\nNow it's a job that just suits me.\n\nI represent diversity\n\nand that just suits the BBC\n\nso I'm chasing monsters.\n\nI'm just a simple Yorkshire lass,\n\nA million miles from middle class.\n\nIf you don't like it, kiss my ass.\n\nI'm off chasing monsters.\n\nAs the Doctor, I'll go far\n\nand I'll never stop.\n\nwith Bradley Walsh, a young black lad\n\nand a female Asian cop.\n\nEtc . . . .etc . . . etc.\n\nShe's from Lancashire, not Yorkshire. Change Yorkshire to Blackpool?\n\nFascinating musings upon class and Doctor Who. Tom Baker, of course, was born in Liverpool and joined a monastery at age 10 but was expelled a year later for sabotaging masturbation rituals (it's all in his gleeful autobiography, Freedom in Exile: The Doctor Declares). He was then famously \"adopted\" by Sid James, who spent a lot of time giving him elocution lessons to lose his Liverpudlian accent. Thanks to this assistance, he graduated to treading the boards and occasional film roles, such as Rasputin (to Terry-Thomas's Tsar Nicholas II) in the Amicus horror version of The Canterbury Tales. He was even selected for a small role in Carry On Up the Scaffolding. but got lost on the way to Pinewood and ended up at a real building site, where a passing Barry Letts discovered him mixing concrete. Letts was so impressed by his technique that he offered him the role of Doctor Who on the spot. We are all the luckier for this.\n\nIt's the writing I don't like.\n\nHer gender and perceived class (by those who get hung up on that sort of nonsense) has nothing to do with it.\n\nI thought the last one was shit as well, and he was old, white male, a bit posh and Scottish.\n\nNot everything's about politics.\n\nIt's just poor quality.\n\nAnd hiding behind some sort of 'victory for working-class women' smokescreen doesn't change the fact.\n\nIn the days when the adjective \"black\" wasn't almost a swearword when uttered by anybody to whom the adjective not apply, I think it might have been quite amusing to ask somebody in the world of writing \"Which British writer is a black woman and also a black man?\"\n\nThe person you're talking to might then ask whether you're talking about a transgender person, or someone who uses a pseudonym, or some other sort of person to whom the description might apply.\n\nWhen they give up, you say \"Malorie Blackman\".\n\nThey will quickly grasp the fact that she is a black woman who is also a 'Blackman' because she is in the Blackman family.\n\nThey might groan a bit but, if they know anything about verbal humour, they'll acknowledge (if only to themselves) that it's a reasonably clever joke and an entirely appropriate joke to tell given that she is currently in the news for writing the latest episode of Doctor Who.\n\nWith regard to the non-white characters in the first episode of the current series of Doctor Who, I would applaud their casting if they had been cast in numbers that accurately reflected ethnic diversity in Britain rather than in hugely improbable numbers in the BBC's campaign of unremitting diversity designed to atone for its long and some would say shameful history of \"whiteness\"."
