        "text": "The covers and story details for the second volume of Christopher Eccleston’s triumphant return are here!\n\nBig Finish have released the individual cover artwork and stories for Respond to All Calls. This new boxset of adventures for Christopher Eccleston’s Doctor is due for release in August 2021. And this time, the Ninth Doctor answers cries for help from around the galaxies in a trio of audio adventures.\n\nAs previously announced, these episodes feature a whole host of brilliant British talent from stage and screen. They include Forbes Masson (The High Life, Catastrophe), Mirren Mack (Sex Education, The Nest), Damien Lynch (Giri/Haji, EastEnders), Gemma Whelan (Upstart Crow, Inside No 9), Adrian Schiller (The Last Kingdom, Silk) and Jan Francis (Just Good Friends, Secret Army).\n\nA missing persons case with a difference in Girl, Deconstructed\n\nLisa McMullin has written opening episode Girl, Deconstructed, which sees the Doctor take up a missing persons case with a difference. She regards getting to write for Christopher Eccleston’s Doctor as particularly special. “It was so exciting to get to write for the Ninth Doctor but also quite daunting!” she says. “But it’s such a privilege and I just feel really lucky to have been asked to do this.\n\n“There’s something about the energy and sheer joy that Christopher brings to the role – you get the sense from watching and listening to him that he’s just having an absolute ball, and it’s infectious!”\n\nFright Motif brings an alien predator to the streets of Paris\n\nMiddle episode Fright Motif, in which the Doctor comes to the aid of a man being stalked by an alien hunter on the streets of Paris, comes from writer Tim Foley. He too has described the glee of writing for his childhood Doctor. “I’ve been a Doctor Who fan from a young age,” he explains, “as soon as the television show came back with Christopher Eccleston as the Doctor, it just became this huge juggernaut that shook everything up.\n\n“Before this, I don’t think I’d ever properly understood what other Big Finish writers meant when they talked of writing for their Doctor Who childhood heroes – but when I came to sit down and write a Ninth Doctor story, it felt like I was immortalising this childhood glee, and it felt addictive. I could do this forever, especially with Christopher Eccleston!”\n\nAn ancient evil awakens at the heart of the Planet of the End\n\nResponds to All Calls finishes with Timothy X Atack’s Planet of the End. The writer sought to recapture Eccleston’s unique Doctor with his story, in which the Time Lord visits a necropolis planet and accidentally wakes one of its most dangerous residents. “Back in 2005, I remember being taken by how fun Chris’ Doctor was,” he explains, “full of life but with this alternating steely and chirpy energy to him that felt so new. The Ninth Doctor was so much more irreverent that I expected, and the whole effect was just delightful – so that’s what I had in my head when the call came from Big Finish to write for the Ninth Doctor.\n\n“And this is such a great box set to be part of – I feel in such excellent company. Lisa’s script has this captivating and bittersweet feel right from the start and, with Mr Foley, his story had me seething with jealousy about the way he uses sound. It’s just too much, I love it!”\n\nDoctor Who: The Ninth Doctor Adventures – Respond to All Calls\n\nHello, the Ninth Doctor speaking!\n\nLeave a message after the vworp – Christopher Eccleston’s Ninth Doctor is on a philanthropic mission in the second volume of Doctor Who – The Ninth Doctor Adventures.\n\nGirl, Deconstructed by Lisa McMullin\n\nMarnie is missing. But she hasn’t run away, as her dad fears – Marnie is still very much at home. But not quite as she was.\n\nThe Doctor joins forces with Missing Persons detective Jana Lee to help solve the mystery of a girl who’s gone to pieces.\n\nFright Motif by Tim Foley\n\nIn post-War Paris, musician Artie Berger has lost his mojo, but gained a predator – something that seeps through the cracks of dissonance to devour the unwary.\n\nLuckily for Artie, the Doctor is here. Unluckily for everyone, he needs bait to trap a monster…\n\nPlanet of the End by Timothy X Atack\n\nThe Doctor arrives on a mausoleum world for sightseeing and light pedantry, correcting its planetary records. The resident AI has other ideas.\n\nDeep within a tomb, something stirs. Occasus is the last resting place of a species far too dangerous to exist. And the Doctor is its way back.\n\nDoctor Who fans worldwide can now pre-order all four volumes of The Ninth Doctor Adventures. They’re available in three formats – collector’s edition CD, digital download or limited edition gatefold triple LP vinyl. All exclusively from the Big Finish website at www.bigfinish.com.\n\nBig Finish listeners can save by pre-ordering a bundle of the entire series for just £88 (as a collector’s edition box set) or £78 (as a download).\n\nDoctor Who – The Ninth Doctor Adventures triple LP vinyls are strictly limited to a pressing of 1,000 per volume.
