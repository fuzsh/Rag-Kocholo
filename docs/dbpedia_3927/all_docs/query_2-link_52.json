        "text": "Movie: Saahasam Swaasaga Saagipo\n\nRating: 2.75/5\n\nBanner: Dwaraka Cine Creations\n\nCast: Akkineni Naga Chaitanya, Manjima Mohan, Baba Sehgal and others\n\nWriter: Kona Venkat\n\nMusic: AR Rahman\n\nCinematography: Donmack Arthur\n\nEditing: Anthony\n\nFights: Silva\n\nProducer: Miryala Raveender Reddy\n\nStory, Screenplay and Direction: Gautham Vasudev Menon\n\nRelease date: Nov 11, 2016\n\nDirector Gautham Menon’s movies are most-eagerly awaited by film lovers and youth as his films offer something fresh.\n\nAfter successful 'Ye Maya Chesaave', Gautam Vasudev Menon has teamed up again with Naga Chaitanya. Since the trailer and songs have created huge buzz around the film, people have been waiting for this film despite it getting postponed several times. And it has finally released now.\n\nLet’s see how the movie has fared.\n\nStory:\n\nA young guy (Naga Chaitanya) is bewitched by the beauty of Leela (Manjima), his sister’s friend who comes to stay in their home as guest. She is a Maharashtrian. She also likes him.\n\nAlthough she stays in his home she doesn’t know his name as no one calls him by his name. When he goes for a short journey to Kanyakumari on his bike, she joins him and goes along with him as pillion rider.\n\nDuring their journey, they become close and fall in love. But an accident changes their life course. Was it an accident or murder plan?\n\nArtistes’ Performances:\n\nNaga Chaitanya is okay. He is perfectly fitted in the character but his performance is just adequate, his work here doesn’t deserve any special mention.\n\nNewcomer Manjima Mohan has beauty and acting skills. She has pulled off the role well. Baba Sehgal gets noticed as evil Marathi police officer.\n\nTechnical Excellence:\n\nMusic of the movie is a big hit on FM channels and digital fronts. All songs are superb. Rehman has given one of his best works for this movie. Music is backbone of the movie. Kona Venkat’s dialogues are neat.\n\nCinematography is very rich. Editing is neat. Fights are different and has lot of style.\n\nHighlights:\n\nDifferent narration\n\nRehman’s music\n\nRomantic track\n\nFirst half\n\nCinematography\n\nDrawback:\n\nInconsistent screenplay\n\nBad Climax\n\nAnalysis:\n\nGautham Menon is one director who makes different kind of movies within action and romance genre. He is equally good at packaging action dramas like “Gharshana” and romantic movies like “Ye Maaya Chesave”.\n\nHis “Saahsam Swaasaga Saagipo” seems like a mix of both the movies but this is slightly different from his usual style of movies.\n\nWhile the movie begins like “Ye Maaya Chesave” – with hero falling for other state girl who lives in his home, goes with her to some place (in YMC it is Kerala, here it is Kanyakumari), etc.\n\nOnce you start feeling that the film is going like “Ye Maaya Chesave” he pulls a trick and makes it an action drama. From the accident scene before the interval, the movie turns into action rampage.\n\nRight after the interval, the movie goes like a thriller – why the Marathi men are after Leela and her family, why a police officer is trying to kill the heroine is unfolded in a slow but gripping manner.\n\nThe way Naga Chaitanya goes after the villains is shot in most stylish way by Gautham Menon. He also cuts the scenes differently.\n\nThe scene where Naga Chaitanya sits in a doctor’s home and tells that he has now turned into a man is terrific. That is the theme of the movie – a boy turning into a man. The hotel scene in the second half is also superb.\n\nEven the twist in the story in the end and the revealing scene of Naga Chaitanya’s name are also good. But again, the movie’s climax gives déjà vu feeling. The fight scene in the end seems too stretched.\n\nAlthough “Saahasam Swaasaga Saagipo” is not an excellent film like “Ye Maaya Chesave” or as gripping as “Raghavan”, this is different movie within commercial format.\n\nThe romantic scenes in the beginning seem very repetitive but the later portion is what makes the difference.\n\nAll in all, different visual style, and thriller mode of narration coupled with A R Rehman’s techno music makes the movie far from the regular stuff."
