        "text": "Amid skepticism about films working to their potential in a season of demonetization, 'Sahasam Swasaga Sagipo' releases as a 'sahasam' in itself. Here is our review of this much-awaited movie.\n\nStory:\n\nNaga Chaitanya (whose name in the film is kept a secret till the climax) is a happy-go-lucky, engineering graduate hanging out with friends who keep extra interest in his love stories, mundane or special. There comes that 'Ye Maya Chesave' moment in his life when the sister's friend (debutante Manjima Mohan as Leela) appears in front of his eyes, \"heating up the room\" as the two hold marathon, breezy conversations.\n\nIt's time for a 'Ye Maya Chesave' tourism, minus Aleppy, but with a shock in store. The two meet with an accident and from now, it's all roller-coaster.\n\nThe guy and his girl are overnight thrown into an abyss when they realize a murderous gang of assorted elements are out to eliminate Leela and her parents. A rowdy cop (played by Baba Sehgal) threatens them with dire consequences, but Chay challenges with actions. The politician-police-criminal nexus won't intimidate him.\n\nThe climax is about how, over a period of 2.5 years, the mystery has been unraveled single-handedly by Chay, letting the audience know why the villains bayed for Leela's blood, and how Chay, who now has a surprise identity, gets his comeuppance.\n\nAnalysis:\n\nAs the makers had made it clear, 'SSS' is a mix of two genres, the first half being a 'YMC' and the second half, a 'Gharsana'. Whatever the description may have suggested to different sections of audiences, Gautham Menon's fans did look forward to watching a narrational bonanza: In the first half, the lover boy would elaborately describe his love, its origin, that feeling when SHE looks at him, etc, and in the second half, the innermost feelings of the underdogs in danger would be mirrored through simple dialogues. Yes, the film gets them right.\n\nAt about 130 or so minutes, 'SSS' is mostly in 'sagipo' mode, taking 'swasa' only to give away some nuances. Even the romantic track is racy enough, interspersed as it is with AR Rahman's 'Taanu Nenu' and 'Chakori'. This is much helped not only because it was not meant to be a conversational love story but a thriller-like shoot out drama. The pre-interval portions in the suspiciously macabre hospital are a treat to watch for the sheer dread they smell of.\n\nThere is something called sensibilities. And 'SSS' comes with Gautham Menon-style sensibilities in good measure. Confessing love in non-melodramatic language when not sure whether he/she will survive. Believable stunts. Credible trepidation. A few more, perhaps.\n\nFor all the healthy deja vu, the film is not without its share of writing-related and execution-related flaws. The climax is delivered like a non-momentous event, with it being too true-to-life to a fault. A film admittedly inspired by a moment in 'The Godfather', 'SSS' comes with an outdated story line. The deliverables lack in subtleties and nuances after a point in the second half when the rising up to the occasion of an ordinary, fun-loving boy is shorn of any haunting drama.\n\nTo his credit the director is not corrupted by the many Kollywood films that play to the gallery by compulsively smuggling in halting comedy even in incredibly severe situations. Or, is it? The behaviour of the main lead in the climax doesn't inspire one to give Gautham a clean chit. It's too sketchy and he looks way too unserious (he doesn't have to because the danger is no longer there would be a bad excuse).\n\nKona Venkat's dialogue make an impact. 'Abbayitho inko abbayila thiragalanede na korika', Manjima tells Chay as they go on a secret trip to Kanyakumari. 'Prema manalni vethukkuntoo ravali. Thala kindula cheseyali. Eppudu love lo paddamo artham avakunda undali' (not in verbatim) Chaitanya tells his gang.\n\nAfter 'Premam', Chay shines once again with his performance. The tone, the body language and the dialogue delivery are all endearing. Manjima Mohan is beautiful, shows fear so well, and complements her male counterpart throughout. This is another film where the female lead has much share in the pie. On the flip side, Manjima looks weighty, and lacks the vivacity and grace typical of Tollywood's A-listers.\n\nBaba Sehgal puts up a confident and impressive act. Daniel Balaji and Satish Krishnan are good.\n\nAR Rahman's music stands out from the beginning. The songs and the BGM take the film to the next level. Dan Macarthur's lens capture scenic locations as well as dull ones equally well, contributing toward elevating the feel. Anthony's editing is a work of class.\n\nVerdict:\n\nA shoot-out drama and a love story, 'SSS' comes with a narration that makes for a good watch. It may not be gripping in the same degree throughout, but the believable stunts, characterizations, and the technical departments ensure you are not bored."
