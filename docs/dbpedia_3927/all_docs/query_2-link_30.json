        "text": "After scorching the screen with her sensual role in Gundello Godaari and chic avatar in Shadow, Taapsee will be seen in a completely different look in Chandrasekhar Yeleti’s upcoming film Sahasam. In the film, she plays the role of an innocent girl who believes that the world will end soon because of the increase in sins. Since Chandrasekhar Yeleti wanted everyone to suit the characters they are playing in the film, Taapsee has gone completely de-glam and even in the songs, the glamour quotient is quite minimal. “Never seen myself the way I look in sahasam. A very special movie in lot of ways,” she said on Twitter. She has pinned a lot of hopes on the film and going by the film’s trailer, Sahasam does look like an action adventure worth remembering. Sri has scored the music and Shamdat is the cinematographer. The film will hit the screens later this month.\n\nArticles that might interest you:"
