        "text": "నమస్కారం! Welcome to the Eleventh Edition in the series “సాహిత్యంలోని తత్వం”. Today, Sandy and I will be talking about two songs from Gunasekhar’s “Okkadu“.\n\n“Okkadu” will always be one of the biggest hits of MB’s career. The film is highly commercial but the director has played to the strengths of MB throughout. And that is why the film worked at that time and has garnered such a cult following for who MB is today. Prakash Raj was a treat to watch as the antagonist and Bhoomika did a decent job too. Mani Sharma’s tunes though, one of the finest and still relevant to this day, with a high repeat value.\n\nThe whole album is written by Guruji Sirivennela Sitaramasastry gaaru. And we will discuss two songs in particular which come in the first half of the film. Please do read the article till the end as we try to draw further comparisons with these two songs and the films story to the Indian Epics.\n\nIn both of these songs, Sastry gaaru is the narrator.\n\nHare Rama\n\nPallavi:\n\nహరే రామ హరే రామ రామ రామ హరే హరే!\n\nహరే కృష్ణా హరే కృష్ణా కృష్ణా కృష్ణా హరే హరే!\n\nరాముణ్ణైనా కృష్ణున్నైనా కీర్తిస్తూ కూర్చుంటామా?\n\nవాళ్ళేం సాధించారో కొంచెం గుర్తిద్దాం మిత్రమా!\n\nసంద్రం కూడా స్థంభించేలా మన సత్తా చూపిద్దామా?\n\nసంగ్రామంలో గీతాపాఠం తెలుపుమా!\n\nThough this is a typical introduction song in the film, the thing to note is that the song is not an introduction for the “hero” but rather to the story of the film.\n\nAs we all know, Lord Ram and Lord Krishna are one of the many avatars of Lord Vishnu whom we worship more dearly in this Kali Yuga. The two Indian Epics “The Ramayana” and “ The Mahabharata” have a lot of comprehensive details about their victories and their lifestyle as well. Sastry gaaru is emphasizing us to acknowledge their achievements and also learn from these tales. He is asking us to rise to the occasion and perform, in such a grand way that the world shall stall and see you do what you’d do.\n\nCharanam 1:\n\nచార్మినార్ చాటు కథకి తెలియదీ నిత్య కలహం!\n\nభాగ్మతి ప్రేమ స్మృతికి బహుమతీ భాగ్యనగరం!\n\nఏం మాయతంత్రం.. మతమై నాటి చెలిమిని చెరిపెరా?\n\nఓం శాంతి మంత్రం.. మనమై జాతి విలువని నిలుపరా!\n\nHe is referring to the communal riots that used to happen frequently in the old city, inturn says that there is no better way for communities to move forward other than living in peace and harmony. The story also revolves around Charminar, so this seems like a deliberate choice by Sastry gaaru to include this reference.\n\nCharanam 2:\n\nపసిడి పతకాల హారం.. కాదురా విజయ తీరం!\n\nఆటనే మాటకర్ధం.. నిను నువ్వే గెలుచు యుద్దం!\n\nశ్రీరామ నవమి జరిపే ముందు లంకను గెలవరా!\n\nనీ విజయ దశమి రావాలంటే చెడును జయించరా!\n\nThe end goal of victory is not merely winning a medal but rather pushing the boundaries of oneself and constantly aspiring greatness. Even in the film, though winning Kabaddi on a National Level is the basic motive of Mahesh Babu, Bhoomika’s entry into his life changes everything for him. Despite all the bad odds, he fights through and wins both the National Kabaddi Championship for his team and also wins the heart of his love interest. Thus, the line ఆటనే మాటకర్ధం.. నిను నువ్వే గెలుచు యుద్దం! is justified for Mahesh Babu’s character.\n\nSastry gaaru is asking to defeat the “Ravana” that is present inside oneself or to decimate the “Evil” forces fighting you and only then think of celebrating it. In the movie’s perspective, this can be viewed as a celebration after defeating Prakash Raj in the climax. Because Mahesh Babu is not the one who kills Prakash Raj, he only defeats him. Bhoomika’s father stabs Prakash and kills him taking revenge for his son’s life. Therefore, the last two lines hold good for what happens at the climax of the film.\n\nSaahasam\n\nPallavi:\n\nసాహసం శ్వాసగా సాగిపో సోదరా..\n\nసాగరం ఈదటం తేలికేం కాదురా!\n\nThis song comes in the Screenplay after the conflict between MB and Prakash Raj takes an unexpected turn and is basically an indicator that MB has now found himself in very big trouble (an ocean of trouble, if you will).\n\nThe funny thing about Sastry gaaru is that he lures you saying “Look, there is a fruit on the tree which you can savor, go get it!” and before you start to make a move at it, he also reminds you that the tree on which the said fruit hangs from is very tall and you need to put in a lot of hard work to get it.\n\nDidn’t get me? Bad analogy?\n\nLet me explain. In Hare Rama song, Sastry gaaru said that you have to show your skill/power/strength in such a way that the “World shall standstill” to watch you, and he specifically uses the words “సంద్రం కూడా స్థంభించేలా మన సత్తా చూపిద్దామా?” to convey this. And here, he says that MB is stuck in an ocean and swimming out of it is not easy (సాగరం ఈదటం తేలికేం కాదురా!). Got it? Understood how Sastry gaaru plays with words?\n\nCharanam 1:\n\nఏ కోవెలో చేరాలని కలగన్న పూబాలకి…\n\nసుడిగాలిలో సావాసమై దొరికింది ఈ పల్లకి…\n\nఈ ఒక్కడు నీ సైన్యమై తోడుంటే చాలు!\n\nHere, Sastry gaaru is equating the hopeless situation of Bhoomika to a bunch of flowers which aspire to reach a temple (serving their purpose). And yet, he is trying to increase the morale of her by saying that the man beside you is equivalent to an army and shall take her to the shores she wanted to reach.\n\nThough Sastry gaaru has already reminded us about the Goal: సంద్రం కూడా స్థంభించేలా మన సత్తా చూపిద్దామా? and also about the practicality of the path anyone would choose: సాగరం ఈదటం తేలికేం కాదురా! he is now reminding us about our own strength: ఈ ఒక్కడు నీ సైన్యమై తోడుంటే చాలు!\n\nWho is that “ఒక్కడు” you may ask. It’s the person inside you. The one who’s living inside your body. That person. That guy/girl is who Sastry gaaru is placing his bets on, confident that the person shall reach the shores of victory. Also, in one’s quest to reach victory, Sastry gaaru has already clearly explained what and how a “victory” should mean to that person, with these lines: పసిడి పతకాల హారం.. కాదురా విజయ తీరం! ఆటనే మాటకర్ధం.. నిను నువ్వే గెలుచు యుద్దం!\n\nFlattered, yet? 🙂\n\nCharanam 2:\n\nకాలానికే తెలియాలిగా ముందున్న మలుపేమిటో..\n\nపోరాటమే తేల్చాలిగా రానున్న గెలుపేమిటో..\n\nఈ ఒక్కడు నీ సైన్యమై తోడుంటే చాలు!\n\nOnly time will tell what all hurdles you shall face in this battle of yours. The only thing that is practically in your hands is to fight the battle with your heart and soul and give it a 100% which shall thus decide your fate (victory/loss). So, believe in yourself and give your best, Sastry gaaru urges.\n\nThough these songs do sound like they talk about the film or the story, the special thing about them is they have a context in the film and also something else entirely independent of the film or its story. That’s a true genius’ work!\n\nSastry gaaru wrote the remaining 4 songs in the album too, but those songs are rather more story/character lenient and do not have much to offer otherwise, hence we chose to write only about the above two songs only.\n\nWe felt that Gunasekhar should have tried better in directing these songs in particular. We dare say that, because we know and many directors have said this too, that Sastry gaaru owns the script and writes songs in such a way that, each song tells the same story in different ways/settings. Each and every time, these songs do justice to the situation as well. Though “Okkadu” is a commercial movie, the direction could have been better. “Nuvvostanante Nenoddantana” is one primary example of how this can be done. Prabhu Deva directed the songs impeccably!\n\nWe honestly believe that Ramayana and Mahabharata are the greatest stories of this land and with them as inspiration, 100’s of movies were made and many more movies shall come out in the future too. They can be treated as textbooks in story writing. Take Mani Ratnam’s Dalapathy or even Raavan. And many of us already know that Rajamouli’s life goal is to make a huge Mahabharata movie series. There are also many theories drawing parallels between Mahabharata and The Avengers (movies/characters). So, like it or not, they are happening and shall keep happening in the future too. 🙂\n\nWe can have a deeper look at both these worlds and come to a consensus for ourselves maybe in a later article. We hope to write an article on that in the future.\n\nSo, coming back to Okkadu, few aspects of this movie can be said to be inspired from Ramayana. We are providing you with some instances to support the claim:\n\n1) There is a song at the far end of the movie called, “Attarintiki” which comes in the context of Prakash flexing his masculinity and then the Bhoomika responds by defining what masculinity is, which are the lyrics of that song. We can draw a parallel between this scenario and to the confrontation of Raavana by Sita Devi in Lanka.\n\n2) The story, on a grassroot level, is simply rescuing Bhoomika from Prakash Raj. In Ramayana, Lord Ram wages war against Raavana with the help of the Vanara Army to rescue Sita Devi. Similarly, Mahesh Babu and his friends go against Prakash Raj’s goons and finally win the battle.\n\n3) Even, the song “Hare Rama” signifies this co-relation of the film’s story to Lord Rama and the Ramayana.\n\nLet us know what do you think of this comparison. Do tell us if you find more such references in the film that we missed."
