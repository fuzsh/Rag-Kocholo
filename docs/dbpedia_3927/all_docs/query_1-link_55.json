        "text": "Naga Chaitanya’s Sahasam Swasaga Sagipo released to some decent reviews all over. The Gautam Menon also had some decent openings in the metros and the latest news is that it has collected close to 2.2 crores on the first day of its release worldwide.\n\nThe film which turns into a suspense thriller has been well appreciated for Chay’s acting skills. A R Rahman’s music is yet another strong point of this film which has Manjima Mohan playing the female lead.\n\nAs the nation is struck with the currency ban, it would be interesting to see how the film fares from now on.\n\nArticles that might interest you:"
