        "text": "After Asin, Nayanthara and Keerthy Suresh, now one more Kerala beuty Manjima Mohan is making her debut into Tollywood with the movie Sahasam Swasaga Sagipo. Directed by Gautham Vasudev Menon, Naga Chaitanya played the lead role in this romantic entertainer. Here is the special chit chat of Manjima Moham with Telugu 360:\n\nDo you understand Telugu now?\n\nI am quite comfortable now. During the early days, I had to struggle and I hired a tutor to learn Telugu. I can understand the language now.\n\nYour first movie got delayed several times. Are you not worried?\n\nI am not worried about the delay. It is completely my duty to perform well. It is the producer’s responsibility to bail out the movie. Though the film is releasing late, it has no negative impact. Gautham Menon’s craze is unbeatable and Sahasam Swasaga Sagipo will sure end up as an impressive entertainer.\n\nPlease tell us about your character in the film?\n\nI play a girl next door role in the movie. Sahasam Swasaga Sagipo is all related to a road journey and my role is quite interesting in the film.\n\nHow was it working with Gautham Menon?\n\nI loved his working style completely. Though I did some Malayalam movies in the past, Sahasam Swasaga Sagipo is a new experience.\n\nAre you watching Telugu movies?\n\nI started watching Telugu movies in the recent times. I loved Manam, Baahubali and Eega.\n\nDo you think you need some special features to make it big in Telugu cinema?\n\nLaughs… Are you talking about glamorous acts and exposing. Things changed completely now and the way the heroines have been thinking too changed. All the heroines have been in search of unique roles which have enough scope to perform rather than getting restricted for four songs. I am not interested in exposing and will not do in the coming future.\n\nDid you face any problems as you are from a non-filmy background. Did you parents oppose your decision?\n\nI revealed my interest to my mother and she supported me. My father has been in shock however I worked hard and finally my parents are quite happy. My father has been quite patient and helpful in this journey.\n\nAbout your studies?\n\nI completed B.Sc Maths. I have no time to continue my studies though I promised my parents that I would balance my studies along with my career.\n\nDid you sign any new Telugu films?\n\nI have been listening to scripts from sometime. However I signed three Tamil movies which made me busy. Will sign Telugu films once I wrap up all these movies.\n\nYour favourite Telugu actors?\n\nRamcharan and Allu Arjun.\n\nAll the Best Manjima for Sahasam Swasaga Sagipo\n\nThank you very much."
