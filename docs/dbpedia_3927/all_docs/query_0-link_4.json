The spell will be lifted, the dance and the joy found again. \"\n In complete freedom from the rules of the traditional recital, the dancers and four musicians train the children in the wonderful world of Indian dance and music.\n Through the power of rhythms, the strangeness of the melodies and the expressive richness of Bharata Natyam, they discover a language, admittedly rooted in a very different culture, but an accessible and contemporary language at the same time.\nSource: Studio of the Golden Hand, Elisabeth Petit",

        "text": "Priyadarsini Govind studied the art of Bharata Natyam in Madras, with two great masters.Swamimalai K. Rajaratnam, teaching him the Nritta - the technique of movement in all its complexity - transmitted to him rigor, strength, precision and the grace of a learned dance, deeply rooted in the tradition and culture of southern India.\n\nSrimati Kalanidhi Narayanan conveyed to her the subtlety of the Abhinaya, this extremely elaborate and sophisticated art of communication, by which the dancer expresses the emotion, the emotions of the poem she interprets; the symbolic gestures of the hands, the look and expressions of the face to translate situations and feelings.\n\nPriyadarsini Govind has been immersed in Bharata Ntaym since childhood. She is unanimously recognized in India today as one of the most brilliant and accomplished dancers of her generation.\n\nShe nourishes her dance with a deep reflection on her intellectual, spiritual and artistic heritage, and the vitality of a young, modern Indian woman in touch with the realities of a changing society.\n\nPriyadarsini stands out today for its maturity, the brilliance and the serenity of its dance. Generous, passionate and delicate, she revisits the traditional repertoire of Bharata Natyam, introducing contemporary poems, with powerful energy and timeless sweetness.\n\nSource: Studio of the Golden Hand\n\nElisabeth Petit studied classical dance at the Ecole Supérieure d'Etudes Chorégraphiques in Paris. She studies contemporary dance - Graham and Limon techniques - at the International Dance Center in Paris; then the Nikolai technique with Quentin Rouiller, Carolyn Carlson and Alwin Nikolaïs\n\n> She approaches the study of Indian dance in 1979, in Paris, with Malavika, then Maïtreyi.\n\nThat same year, she became a student at Madras, Sri V. Sr. Muthuswamy Pillai and Srimati Kalanidhi Narayanan.\n\n> Fellow of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs from 1983 to 1986, she presented her Arangetram (first recital) in Madras in 1985.\n\n> In 1988 she received the \"Villa Medicis off the Walls\" scholarship. She has appeared in numerous recitals in India, France, Germany, Switzerland, Austria, England, Belgium, Italy, Yugoslavia, Guyana, alone, or accompanied by her teacher and musicians.\n\n> In 1992, Elisabeth Petit began a choreographic research project based on her dual training in India and the West. This takes the form of a duet with Mathilde Monnier, choreographed by Christian Trouillas, accompanied by a musical encounter between Louis Sclavis and Balachandar (mridangam); and a solo on a musical composition by Jean Paul Céléa (Autumn Festival in Paris, Lille Festival, tour in India).\n\n> Following a three-month residency, she created in 1996 a contemporary choreography for three dancers, at the CNDC d'Angers, then at the Montpellier Festival.\n\n> Elisabeth returns in 1998 to the solo recital of Bharata Natyam, and deepens a work of appropriation of the Abhinaya (expressive aspect of Indian dance).\n\n> In 2004 she began an artistic collaboration with Priyadarsini Govind: the elaboration and the realization of a recital choreographed and danced by this one. A first recital is thus created in 2006 at the Théâtre de la Ville, in Paris. A second recital will be created in 2008, again at the Théâtre de la Ville and Chateauvallon.\n\n> In 2007, she created \"SAHASAM\", a Young Audience show created at the Maison de la Danse in Lyon, which she choreographed and performed with Priyadarsini Govind.\n\n> In 2009, Elisabeth organizes a fourth European tour for Priyadarsini and continues her artistic collaboration with her.\n\n> In 2010, she collaborated on the writing of a book published by \"Actes Sud\" on the occasion of the 30th anniversary of the Montpellier Danse International Festival. It traces the history of \"Montpellier Danse and India\".\n\n> In 2011, she organizes the arrival of Priyadarsini Govind in Paris, for two recitals at the Guimet Museum.\n\n> In December 2012, Elisabeth is invited to present a conference danced during the annual Dance and Music Festival of Chennai, India. The theme proposed to the artists for this Natya Kala Conference held at Krishna Gana Sabha is: \"When parallels meet\" and the title of his lecture: \"The unlikely encounters\".\n\nSource: Studio of the Golden Hand\n\nAuthor, filmmaker and video artist Charles Picq (1952-2012) entered working life in the 70s through theatre and photography.
