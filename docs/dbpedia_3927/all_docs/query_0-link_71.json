Finally film will release in this week after facing many problems.\n\nEven though censor was completed, considering the audience interest 15 minutes length was decreased from film before two days of film release. There are two songs in film. Director, producers thought that in that kind of context audience won’t accept film for about 2.5 hours. So they decreased 15 minutes from film and made it to nearly 2 hours. Means own censor to already censor completed film.\n\nSri, Chakravathi son after a long time gave music to this film. Producer Prasad who produced this film with Gopi Chand who is waiting for hit film and Tapsi who doesn’t have more hits is also waiting for right hit."
