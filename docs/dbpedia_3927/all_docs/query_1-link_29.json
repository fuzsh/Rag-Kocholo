        "text": "Years ago, Gopichand played a Telugu guy struggling with the language in Bihar in Andhrudu. If that was the case, we wonder how he he would manage in a ‘hostile’ country like Pakistan? Well, Gopi seems to be so lucky that every Pakistani he meets surprises him by uttering Telugu. Not just that, Gopi can easily drive all around Pakistan without a GPS device. Maybe, the director made every character speak in Telugu so that the audience does not get alienated. Still, it’s awkward and looks unrealistic.\n\nIronically, Chandrasekhar Yeleti is one director who loves to do realistic movies. (Doubters, watch his Anukokunda Oka Rozu). In fact, even in this flick, the start was promising.\n\nThe hero, Gautam (Gopi), desperate to make easy bucks , falls prey to superstitious tricks (here, the director makes a spoof on TV commercials that fool people in the name of God). Our man meets Nidhi (Tapsee), a devout Hindu, who wishes to travel to Pakistan. Now, both head to Hinglaj Devi temple (Hinglaj temple, located in the Balochistan province of Pakistan and believed to be one of Shakti Peetas). While Nidhi does it for religious purposes, Gopi has a hidden agenda. The film looks pretty believable till this stage, but the moment the duo enters Pakistan, it looks like a fairy-tale story. Perhaps, the makers could have made the climax some what believable. For example, there is a scene where the lead pair head for India through a secret tunnel, that too from Hinglaj to India.\n\nFor Gopichand, this is a do-or-die film, and he is awesome as a security guard, dreaming to make it big one day. He is equally good at action sequences. Tapsee does well in her limited role and has dubbed her voice in chaste Telugu. Shakti Kapoor, who plays a terrorist, too comes up trumps."
