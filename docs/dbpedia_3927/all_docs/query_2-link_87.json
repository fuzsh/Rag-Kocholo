        "text": "Shakti Kapoor is a well known name in Bollywood and he was one of the senior actor and played versatile roles in his career.He was also known face to Tollywood audience and we have seen in Gopichand’s film ‘Sahasam’ playing the villain.\n\nThe latest hoax we hear is that Veteran actor is no more.The news of Shakti Kapoor’s sudden death surfaced on messaging service WhatsApp, saying the actor has been killed in a car accident while travelling from Mumbai to Khandala.\n\nThe news spread like wild fire and soon social media was flooded with messages about the actor’s demise and some well wishers mourning his death.However, it later turned out that the news was fake and that Shakti is absolutely fine and healthy.\n\nHis son Sidharth Kapoor took to micro blogging site twitter to clarify the false news and said that his father is fine and doing well.”Its all rumours, my father is fine .there was no accident., touchwood.Please RETWEET all.” he tweeted.\n\nSadly this is not the first time media houses jumped their guns soon about the actor’s death.Recently we heard rumors about death of senior actress Manorama and later it proved as futile."
