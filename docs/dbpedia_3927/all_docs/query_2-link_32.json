        "text": "Helllo friendsâ€¦\n\nThis is my first blog of my life.Just trying to pen something what i felt about the latest telugu movie Sahasam. ðŸ™‚\n\nThe story is all about Gowtham, a security gaurd is goes to pakisthan for his grand fathers property.Gowtham is the one who is unhappy with the kind of life he is living and want to earn more money.Most of the times he will be lost in dreams of earning more and more money.He spends his money and time in kundali stones and on lottery tickets.Tapseeâ€¦ooops forgot her name in the movie,played the role of a decent girl who believe in god and who believes that the world will come to an end soon.Tapsee get to meet Gautham during a fight and develops negative feelings towards him.What sort of negative feeling(check out in the movie..).\n\nOne fine day he will come to know that he has his grandfatherâ€™s property in pakistan.He manages to go to Pakisthan with Tapsee.How he comes to know?How he feels that it is true?How he manages to reach there?Whether he will get his property or not are the things which you have to watch on the BIG screen.Please dont think of watching it in small screenâ€™s(Your TV sets).The kick is only when you watch it on the silver screen\n\nSahasam is the latest telugu movie directed by Chandrasekhar Yeleti , starring Gopichand and Taapsee Pannu.\n\nFirst set of kudoâ€™s showers on the technical team,who has taken care of even the minute aspects of the graphics,which is the highlight of the movie.\n\nDirector has a very clear idea on what he want to present.The way he build the characters is very good.The best thing he has done is, he limited the scope of the heroinâ€™s character although she looked so beautiful.Coming to Gopichand,the hero of the movie has done his role very well.Ali has done his role well.There is no scope for more comedy in the movie and not needed either.Background score is simple superb and the songs didnt go well with me ðŸ™‚"
