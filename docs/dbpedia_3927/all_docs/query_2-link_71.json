        "text": "Bangalore: When a Gautham Menon film releases, there are some definite things like his characters’ names and music that’ll up your chin. The story more often than not is excellent. But that’s secondary. Like Woody Allen, Menon has a reputation for frequently using certain tropes in his works. Ah, that’s just an introduction to his filmography. Move on! There’s more.\n\nOver a decade and a half, he’s made a sizeable number of movies, mostly which fall under the hit umbrella. The film might be about a dad and a son or a cop and his mission, he still opens a window for a breezy romantic track in the screenplay. His gameplay with romance is a study extraordinaire.\n\nWho would think of revealing the hero’s love interest in the first teaser itself? Where do you find a gang of young men playing carrom with A. R. Rahman’s music softening your nerves? Where do you see a lead actor express his interactions with the woman he’s fallen in love with such ardor?\n\nWhere have you seen a teaser that winks at you casually to bring out the names of the members of the crew? Which recent teaser made you watch it on repeat mode just for the two lines from a song you can’t make heads or tails of?\n\nThe teasers of ‘Sahasam Swasaga Sagipo’ and ‘Achcham Yenbadhu Madamaiyada’, have not given a single clue about the thrilling aspect of the movie or the title. Trust Menon to make a bilingual. He may sprinkle surprises like he did in 2010 by altering the climaxes of ‘Vinnaithaandi Varuvaayaa’ and ‘Ye Maaya Chesave’ or he may stick to the same drama like he did in 2012 with ‘Neethaane En Ponvasantham’ and ‘Yeto Vellipoyindhi Manasu’. What’s his strategy this time?\n\nThe variation in the latest teasers of his upcoming films is unmissable. While Naga Chaitanya begins his story on an unnamed street, Simbu begins his story by a carrom board. The major difference in their style of narration is a subtle one too. Chaitanya explains his state of mind to his friends uninhibitedly. He gives a clear picture of what’s happening to him whereas Simbu shares his feelings by letting his friends walk into his thoughts.\n\nEven this works for his clean… pure love!"
