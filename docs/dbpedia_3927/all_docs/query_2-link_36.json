        "text": "Story\n\nHe (Naga Chaitanya) is an unemployed graduate who roams around with a gang of friends. He falls in love with Leela (Manjima Mohan) who is a friend of his sister. He takes up a bike tour on his favorite Royal Enfield to Kanya Kumari. Leela joins him. Something unexpected happens during their return. The rest of the story is all about how he puts his life at risk to save her and demystifies the cause behind it.\n\nArtists Performance\n\nActors: Naga Chaitanya gives an authoritative yet natural performance as an youngster who takes extreme measures to help his love out. Most of the film runs on his voice-over and he does complete justice with dialogue delivery. He excels in casual romance scenes as well as intense action episodes. Manjima Mohan fits the bill and adds the necessary glamor and substance to the film. Rakendu Mouli Vennelakanti (son of veteran lyricist and dialogue writer Vennelakanti) is impressive as buddy of Naga Chaitanya. Baba Sehgal is good as a bad cop though he goes overboard at times (may be the script requirement).\n\nTechnical departments\n\nStory - screenplay - direction: As shown in the titles, latter part of the film is inspired by the hospital episode of the classic âThe Godfatherâ. The film is narrated in a voiceover format. The first half is dedicated to establish heroâs ability, characters and romance. Second half is packed with action episodes with the end revealing the mystery. Gautham Vasudev Menon has made sure that he infuses two things he is known handle the best - romance and stylish action. You can find a bit of Ye Maya Chesave flavor throughout first half where he establishes the chemistry between the lead pair with nuances and conversations. Continuous action episodes are tiring in the second half as itâs mostly about chasing and shooting. Screenplay should have been better in the second half though the director ends it up by connecting all the dots well and by giving a colorful closure. The way Gautham Menon made Royal Enfield bike a character in the film is good. The way hero and heroine propose to each other at crucial moments is nicely captured. Hiding the hero's name and revealing towards the end is delightful.\n\nOther departments: Songs scored by AR Rahman are fabulous. Background music is terrific. The picturization of songs is apt. The way director picturised the duet (shot in abroad) of Vellipomake by juxtaposing with the most crucial episode of the film is an experiment and it worked well. However, the director has placed all the songs in the first half. Cinematography by Dan Macarthur is excellent and it gives a mood to the film. Director Gautham Menon has choreographed all the songs and they are pretty creative (for example, shokilla song is more like a montage song than a club song). Dialogues by Kona Venkat are good. Editing by Anthony is fine. Production values of the film are decent.\n\nAnalysis: Sahasam Swasaga Sagipo is a mix of three genre - romance, action and suspense. First half of the film is nice with characters introduction, romance and a suspense-oriented interval episode. Second half is tedious with continuous and lengthy action episodes (though shot stylishly). The end is good. Plus points are Naga Chaitanya, songs, and romance. On the flip side, excessive action episodes and slow narration make an impact on the outcome. SSS is definitely a different format film and we need to see how audiences take it!"
