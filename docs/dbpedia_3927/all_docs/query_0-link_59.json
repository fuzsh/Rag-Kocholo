        "text": "Just as the film begins, there appears a small note on the screen quoting “Inspired from a moment present in ‘The Godfather’ film”,director Gautam Vasudev Menon brushes away your thoughts of imagining the film primly to be of romantic genre, which anyone can infer after listening to its songs (or) from watching its posters. Indirectly, he hints you that it could be something much more which justifies the film’s tittle.\n\nThe film begins in director’s conventional way of introducing characters, where the protagonist Naga Chaitanya explains the story in background, while other characters appear on the screen. After few minutes into the film, the story appears to be moving ahead in a relaxed manner, just when it gets into your senses that story has been slow till now, it suddenly springs into a moment of surprise, realizing the initial note which appeared right at film’s beginning.\n\nIn simple words, Sahasam Swasaga Sagipo can be described as how Protagonist’s instinctive decision at a critical situation, turned out to create a ripple of events. How did he handle those events? what is the reason for that critical situation is all about the rest of the story.\n\nThis film’s narration had been different through out its runtime, though it has its low moments. What makes the film to be watched is its engaging screenplay and unconventional manner in which the cause and its effects have been described. What’s most surprising in the film is the placement of ‘Vellipomakey’ song and also portraying of protagonist without a particular name. The low points of the film appear in climax, where the Protagonist’s name is revealed. Revealing of Protagonist’s name is not the low point (in fact director had justified the hype created by Protagonist, as he explains why he would never reveal his name with ease, whenever he is questioned about it) but the scenes which follow it are the low moments.\n\nComing to other technical departments of the film, cinematographer Dan Macarthur and his team, AR Rahman must be appreciated for beautifully portraying the road journey through equally pleasant music, making the motion picture on whole to look like a beautiful poem recited on screen. Naga Chaitanya matured more as an actor, one can understand from this film. Rakendu Mouli Vennalakanti, lyricist turned actor had done his part well. Manjima Mohan as heroine made a decent debut in Telugu.\n\nFinally, Sahasam Swasaga Saagipo has some terrific moments to watch out for. It has some equally few low moments, which when ignored can engage you well into the film. When you watch a film, if you forget your surroundings and involve into the film as if you are a part of it, then the film is equally successful in achieving what it intended for. In this case(Sahasam Swasaga Sagipo), the feeling of ‘ forgetting your surroundings and being a part of film’ while watching, differs from viewer to viewer."
