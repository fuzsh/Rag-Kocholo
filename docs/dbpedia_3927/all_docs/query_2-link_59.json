I also liked the climax part of it which lasts for over half an hour. The director could have done a better job in doing the episodes of Pakistan engrossing. Sahasam is not a perfect film and it has its share of negative points. But I am giving it a rating of 3.25 for the guts of producers who came forward to make a different film and for the conviction of director to stick to the core subject and for not deviating from it for the sake of commercial elements. .\n\nVisit Site for more\n\nRatings:3.25/5 Review By:Mahesh KoneruSite:123Telugu\n\nSahasam is not your average Telugu cinema. The plot, the setting and the execution are very fresh and novel. Brilliant cinematography, nice action sequences and some thrilling moments are big assets for the movie. On the flip side, lack of traditional commercial elements might hamper the film in B and C centers. You can safely watch Sahasam for some desi Indiana Jones moments.\n\nVisit Site for more\n\nRatings:– Review By:Sashidhar A SSite:Times Of India (TOI)\n\nFor an adventurous script, the tempo and emotions should run high but the film lacks the required trigger. As a result, it fails to draw the audience attention. The director could not engage the audience as the screenplay wasn’t gripping but the narration style could save the film.Chandrasekhar Yeleti needs to be applauded for his tryst of an adventurous film €” something that’s unique in Telugu films.\n\nVisit Site for more\n\nRatings:3/5 Review By:Common ManSite:APHerald\n\nWhat Is Good: Amazing action episodes, Superb Cinematography, Surprising special effects and Art work, Interval Bang, Climax & Chandra Sekhar Yeleti Taking. What Is Bad: Lack of entertainment, No mass elements for B&C center audience, Missing tempo at times. Watch It or Not?: After a long time decent adventure film came out in Tollywood, go for it.\n\nVisit Site for more\n\nRatings:3.25/5 Review By:SwathiSite:TeluguMirchi\n\nTechnically Sahasam is excellent. Cinematography, re-recording, action, visual effects are mind blowing. Technical crew deserves praises. In spite of all these merits, we get the feeling that something is missing in movie. It takes some time for viewers to sink into the story. Viewers tend to get glued to the screen spellbound by the brilliance, rather than getting involved in the movie. Barring these minor glitches, Sahasam is a well attempted adventure worth watching. Chandrashekar Yeleti once again gave relief for Telugu audience who are fed up with routine flicks, dished out in the name of commercial entertainers."
