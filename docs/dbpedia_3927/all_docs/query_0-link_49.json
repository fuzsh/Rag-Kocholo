        "text": "Continuing with its trend for bringing hard core VFX for the auds, Prasad EFX has recently delivered 1100 VFX shots for Gopi Chand and Tapsee Pannu starrer Telugu movie ‘Sahasam’. The VFX for the movie was executed within a span of seven months at Prasad EFX Hyderabad and Chennai facilities.\n\nDirector of Sahasam, Chandra Sekhar Yeleti approached the studio post completion of their shoot for the first phase of the movie and were all praise for Prasad EFX work and chose them for this project and assigned a series of strong animations, 3d-tracking, digital matt backgrounds, complicated rope removals and compositing sequences to be composed in ‘Sahasam’.\n\nSpeaking to Animationxpress.com’s Zeenia Boatwala about the brief shared by Chandra Sekhar Yeleti on how the VFX should be, Ch.Sreenivas – Head VFX & DI, Prasad EFX, Hyderabad, says, “Chandra Sekhar Yeleti explained about the chief VFX work that would come in the climax of the movie which included the Well sequence, Bridge, Hundi and Sound chamber sequences. We were so thrilled after hearing this brief that we wanted to start off with the work soon.”\n\nIt was in December last year that team strength of around 60 artists at Prasad kick started work on ‘Sahasam’ and they consider the Well sequence, Bridge sequence, Hundi Chamber and Sound chamber shots as the power packed VFX sequences in the movie.\n\nExpressing happiness on the VFX done, Hima Kumar, Vice President, DI& VFX at Prasad EFX, indicates, “The technical contribution of the Director and Cinematographer in the VFX shots was of great help in this project. The excellent team work headed by Ch.Sreenivas, Head – VFX & DI under the supervision of Visual Effect Supervisors D.Viswaprakash and Prasad is reflected in the wonderful sequences of VFX and is a highlight in the film”.\n\nIn the well sequence, the actual well shots were taken in an outdoor temple where there weren’t any signs of well or water and Ch.Sreenivas adds here to inform about the VFX punch that Prasad EFX instilled, “With the help of computer graphics, we created a miniature well with water having a ratio of 1:12 and matched the dynamics perfectly to resemble real water.”\n\nOne prime challenging area for the team was to bring out the VFX for Bridge sequence in which they had to first create a 3D cave for which they created a matte painting of the cave and then had to send it to the director for approval.\n\nInforms more, “Once the matte painting was approved, we started the modeling work of the cave and also the water that you see flowing beneath the bridge is a separate layer shot by our VFX team.”\n\nFor bringing out the Hundi Chamber sequence, the team received creative inputs from the Director, Highlights more, “The Directors visualization for this scene and his technical inputs at each and every phase for the Graphics generation helped us execute this sequence to his complete satisfaction.”\n\nComing to the Sound Chamber sequence, the team enhanced the number of chains with blades throughout the sequence, Adds further, “I must say that the shots of body slice as well as steps forming were executed very realistically by us.”\n\nAs we say, there is a punch that helps such hard core VFX to be carried out with ease, so what’s the punch that Prasad EFX had? Here it is answered for us by Ch.Sreenivas, “We carried out the Pre-visualization for the all shots including the climax sequence much before we started the actual shoot. Once we had the edited inputs we worked on wide angle single shots to freeze the final look for each sequence. And, after the director approved the look and feel of each sequence we then went on for bringing out the final renders.”\n\n“I’m happy to unfold that the VFX was challenging, but we exceeded the Director’s expectations.”\n\nPrasad EFX feels that the VFX shots seen during the climax of this movie are the best for them and a must watch for the auds and will soon reveal their story on more VFX projects happening at the studio."
