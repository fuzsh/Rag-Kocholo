        "text": "Macho hero Gopichand is testing his fortunes at the Box Office after a long gap. His film ‘Sahasam’ is going to hit the screens this Friday, July 12, and he is quite excited about it. Chandrasekhar Yeleti has directed this action adventure and BVSN Prasad is the producer. We had a very candid and interesting conversation with him. He spoke about his previous projects, his career choices and his expectations on ‘Sahasam’. Read on to see what he had to say.\n\nQ. It has been a while since your last film released…\n\nA. Yes. It is a very long gap. I have never had this kind of a gap in my career. When we started out, we planned to complete ‘Sahasam’ in six months. But the careful detailing, the special effects and other such issues prolonged it beyond six months. But I am very happy with the final output.\n\nQ. Is the story based in Pakistan?\n\nA. Yeah, the hero goes to Pakistan in search of something. The story is set in the Pakistan border areas. We shot those portions in Ladakh, as it is easy to replicate the landscape and the conditions of Pakistan.\n\nQ. Your previous films did not exactly do well…\n\nA. (Smiles) “Did not exactly do well kaadhu. They are flops.”\n\nQ Is it not a ‘Sahasam’ then to attempt an action adventure instead of a commercial entertainer?\n\nA. ‘Sahasam’ is not an experimental film. It is a proper commercial entertainer. It is just that the film will have fewer songs that other films. The two songs will come in only during appropriate times, without disturbing the emotion of the film. We did not want to disrupt the flow of the story. Other than this part, the film is a typical commercial entertainer with Yeleti’s touch.\n\nQ. When you look back at your career, ‘Mogudu’ is very different from the other movies. Did you want to come out of the action hero image?\n\nA. I had great faith in Krishna Vamsi garu and I banked on him to bring me out of the action hero image. I was expecting something along the lines of ‘Ninne Pelladutha’. But it did not come out as expected and went off in a different direction.\n\nQ. Sentiments play a big part in the film industry. Did the team think twice before casting Tapsee?\n\nA. “Mana time bagolenappudu papam thanu maatram em chestundhi? “. If you look at the recent trends, heroines who had a flop image are scoring hits. Heroines who were known for their hits are tasting defeat. So, I do not believe in this. Chandrasekhar Yeleti also insisted on Tapsee for this role.\n\nQ. Is this the most demanding film you have worked in?\n\nA. Physically, this is the most demanding film. I learnt horse riding for 20 days in order to shoot a few scenes. Shooting in Ladakh was also tough due to the thin air in high altitudes.\n\nQ. ‘Sahasam’ seems to be the most expensive film in your career..\n\nA. All I can say is, the film will look a lot grander and bigger than it is supposed to be.For the money we spent, the look and feel of the film is simply superb.\n\nQ. How is married life?\n\nA. (Smiles) It is good. It is quite different from bachelor life. I enjoyed that life all these years. Now let me enjoy this.\n\nQ.Who stood by you during this tough phase?\n\nA. I kept myself busy with this project. Apart from this, I also believe in fate. “Mana time bagoledhu ani odileyatam”\n\nQ. How different is ‘Sahasam’ from other Telugu action adventure films?\n\nA. As far as I know, the last Telugu film in this genre is ‘Takkari Donga’. Technology has changed significantly after that and our budgets are bigger now. We have scope to do things in a much bigger way. So ‘Sahasam’ will be a very new experience.\n\nQ. What are your future projects ?\n\nA. I will work with B.Gopal garu and with Deva Katta. Vakkantham Vamsi provided the script for B.Gopal’s film and I liked that story. Some other films are in discussion stage. I will reveal more details soon.\n\nQ. Will you accept negative roles again in future if they appeal to you ?\n\nA. I would love to do a role which has negative shades. “Heroism undi, negative shades unte baguntundhi”. Rajasekhar’s ‘Talambraalu’ is a good example.\n\nQ. What can you tell viewers about ‘Sahasam’ ?\n\nA. The trailer has created good expectations among viewers. The film will be better than the trailer. There will be many edge of the seat moments and the RR for this film has come out really well. Shyam Datt’s cinematography is also a big asset for the movie. So, viewers will definitely have an enjoyable experience.\n\nWith that, we wrapped our interview with Gopichand and wished him the very best for ‘Sahasam’. We hope you enjoyed reading this transcript.\n\nVery few directors acknowledge the contributions made by his/her technicians to the film. Most tend to extol the stars, but not the stars behind the screen. Director Chandrasekhar Yeleti always relies more on the technicians than on the charisma of the stars, right from his highly appreciated debut film, Aithey. Yeleti has a good fan following among film lovers who seek different kind of movies, for he has made films that are offbeat, intelligent and technically sound. After Aithey, Anukokunda Oka Roju, Okkadunnadu, and Prayanam, he has now come up with Saahasam, scheduled for release on 12th July, 2013.\n\nSaahasam is a treasure hunt thriller starring Gopichand and Tapsee. Since the film is an adventurous action movie with high technical values, we sat with the director to discuss about technicians of his movie and the making of the movie.\n\nWhat is the movie about?\n\nIt is an adventure thriller. Gopichand plays a role of security guard in Hyderabad. He goes to Pakistan to find out his ‘assets’ there. He meets a girl played by Tapsee, together they set out to go to Pakistan. The movie is about their adventurous journey through the Indo-Pak border, terrorist camps, etc.\n\nHow did the story idea emanate? And tell us contribution of writers.\n\nIt has been more than 60 years that India and Pakistan parted. Despite the partition I read in some magazines that there are disputes about assets, many cases are still in pending in courts. This article spurred me to weave a story. This time I wanted to work with a group of writers rather than working alone on script. Radhika Anand, a writer who has done formal training in script writing, joined me in developing the script. Two writers - Prasanth Sagar and Suma Latha, also worked on the script while Radha Krishna (of Prayanam fame) wrote dialogues. All these writers played huge role in bringing out the best for the script. For the first time in my career, I worked with a writing team and am totally happy with their contribution. Sandeep Gunnam also worked for few days on the script.\n\nCinematography will stun everyone\n\nCinematographers excel when they work for a thriller, as the genre offers the chance to put their best. When I thought of making this film, I knew I needed a cinematographer who can give best output and in short span of time. Also more than the technical guy, I wanted a cameraman who catches the emotional aspect of the story. I have known Shamdat for a long time and I took him for second film starring Uday Kiran, which eventually didn't take off. But we are good friends and kept in touch regularly.\n\nWhen I wanted to take up this project, I called him. In the meantime, he did some great work in Malyalam films and in Telugu he got name for his work for Prasthanam and Avakayi Biryani. He is non-fussy and quick in delivering the results. We shot in locations that can be termed tough terrains. In Ladakh, where Oxygen levels are very low, a cinematographer will not have the luxury of time in setting up the lighting and all. He has to be fast. For Shamdat, all he needs is minute's time if we ask him to set up the camera. Even in a quick span, he gets best angles and visuals.\n\nHe is an emotional cinematographer; he catches the 'aatma' of the story, and goes with it rather than the mere technique.\n\nWhich camera did you use? Any color schemes followed for this film specially?\n\nWe shot the entire film on RED EPIC camera. We didn't use any special color schemes but we went for pastel shades for some scenes. We tried to make the film look very simple, not glossy. Rather we went for \"panoramic view.\"\n\nShamdat came up with breath taking visuals of Ladakh. The place is cinematographers’ paradise. Shooting there is strenuous physically but it offers 1000 options. The film looks as if God painted leisurely in his free time. Shamdat captured them beautifully. After watching the film, he will get more appreciation than any of us.\n\nWhat made you to rope in music director Sri who has completely stopped composing for films?\n\nThe primary reason why I roped in Sri is the film needs top notch background score. Not that songs are not important but the film needs specific background music themes. I am a very big fan of his work. Be it Ram Gopal Varma's Gaayam or Anaganaga Oka Roju or Krishnavamsi's Sindhuram or Gunnam Gangaraju's Little Soldiers, even today I remember the background scores of those films.\n\nIn Gaayam, he gave a various signature style scores for hero's character, villain's role. Every time Jagapathi Babu enters on the scene, we get to hear a specific musical score.\n\nAnd his songs, as we all know, are different, yet very haunting. I wanted to work with him. And when I met him and told this story, he immediately agreed. He was not sitting idle but he was looking for a exciting film to make a comeback. And gladly, he liked my script and agreed to do the film. You will be amazed with his R.R (Re-recording) work in this film. There is certain elegance in his music. In Saahasam, I myself got goose bumps in some episodes with his score.\n\nAudiographer who worked for RGV's Shiva and Manirathnam's Bombay..\n\nWorking with A S Lakshmi Narayanan sir is a learning experience for me. He mixed sound for some classics like Ram Gopal Varma's Shiva, Manirathnam's Bombay and Amrutha, and blockbusters like Shankar's Sivaji. He went with the emotions of the story, rather than putting all sound effects to make it loud. His audiography has elevated the film further.\n\nPerfect editing\n\nI give more credit to editor in this film. Since I worked with a digital camera for the first time, I shot more rush (shooting visuals). Yet, my editor Chandrasekhar (who has been working with me for long time as digital editor) gave best output. He paced the film perfectly; he caught the emotion and tension in the script rightly. I gave little inputs to him and asked him to work freely. I am really stunned by some of the edited scenes in the second half of the film. I was like was it really me who filmed those scenes? Such absolutely great output he brought out with my rush. Run time of the movie is about 2.20 hours.\n\nPakistan military episodes will be talked about!\n\nSo far, I worked with art director Ravinder for all my films. But this time, I chose Ramakrishna. I loved his work in Andala Rakshasi and immediately signed him. He has worked as assistant to renowned art director Sabu Cyril.\n\nHis work will be more noticed by everyone. He has recreated Pakistan military academy and other military wings so real. His artwork and sets are so natural. His sets in Ladakh portions in the film, and a 'sound chamber' he created for the film for a key action episode in the second half of the movie is going to be talked about a lot.\n\nAction stunts are natural and on international standards\n\nGenerally, I like action sequences to be very natural. So when Selva's name is suggested for this film, I was apprehensive. Though he is a very big fight master, I was in doubt that whether he could adjust to my style. But all my apprehensions were cleared off as we started working together. He loved the film more than me and gave his best. In Ladakh, when we wanted to shoot a car toppling sequence in a more thrilling way, the local experts refused to perform citing it was more dangerous. Then he came forward to do it himself. We shot two major action sequences in Ladakh which are on top notch scale. The way he shot a gun fight and an action race is simply superb.\n\nCostumes and look of the film\n\nSameera did the costumes for major part of the film. She was there throughout in the making of the movie. She did great work with costumes like creating turbans keeping with tone of the movie. Divya-Lipsa Jain did costumes for Tapsee."
