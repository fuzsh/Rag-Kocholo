        "text": "Celebrity death hoax is a concept not new to India anymore. Bollywood actor and Villain Shakti Kapoor' has become the latest celebrity victim of an Internet hoax with social networking sites abuzz on Saturday with rumors about his demise.\n\nRecent rumor about the death of Shakti Kapoor' in a car accident was dispelled by Siddanth Kapoor; son of Shakti Kapoor' when he later posted on the micro -blogging website Twitter.' Siddhanth took to twitter to clarify the false news. \"Its all rumours, my father is fine .. there was no accident., touchwood.. Please RETWEET all..\" he tweeted.\n\nShakti Kapoor is not the only celebrity to fall prey to such rumors. Other celebs who have been dogged by such online death rumors are Dilip Kumar, Amitabh Bachchan, Rajinikanth, Lata Mangeshkar, Yo Yo Honey Singh, Asha Parekh and Kader Khan, among others.\n\nRecently we have heard some rumors about death of Veteran actress Manorama. Shakti Kapoor is a well known name in Bollywood and for Tollywood audiences he is not a new face or name as we have seen in Gopichand's recent film 'Sahasam' playing the villain.\n\n'\n\nNews Posted: 23 February, 2015"
