For that you must watch the movie on big screen…\n\nAnalysis:\n\nComing to the Sahasam movie analysis the film’s theme and story are very novel for Telugu cinema. Chandrasekhar Yeleti should be recommended to handle the work in an exceedingly competent way. The pictures are extremely grand and Ladakh continues to be taken quite majestically. Pakistani atmosphere continues to be recreated quite effectively and legitimately. The treasure search, the intricate clues that cause it and also the effects are very thrilling. Fans of films like National Treasure, Tomb Raider and Indiana Johnson will love this movie. The film’s action sequences deserve special mention. They’ve been choreographed quite reasonably. The gun fights and also the vehicle chases are great.\n\nThe interval and climax episodes happen to be created quite nicely. Our male lead Gopichand performs exceptionally well becoming Goutham. He is excellent within the action sequences and the body gestures are ideal for your role. Tapsee is very good within this film like a devout and slightly naive youthful lady. Ali entertains to some extent as Khayamat Raju. Shakti Kapoor is just brilliant because the evil terrorist Sultan. His transformation and gratifaction are extremely authentic.

Suman includes a brief role and that he has been doing a great job.\n\nPerformances:\n\nGopichand looked easily fit in the film and emerged with a decent performance of course. He’s particularly good for action sequences. Tapsee the very first time made an appearance inside a girl nearby character. The typical loudness we have seen in her own figures isn’t within this movie and she or he carried out well. Suman is nice within the little character which is available in the expensive back. Ali’s comedy track as Qayamat Raju is ok but might have been written well. Shakthi Kapoor is great becoming a dreaded terrorist. Narayana Murthy is alright as Gopichand’s father. Relaxation from the figures is okay.\n\nTechnicalities:\n\nChandrasekhar Yeleti has been successful in delivering a technically superior adventure flick. Because of the financial constraints, he’s done a good job. He must have taken some worry about the entertainment quotient within the film. Shyam Dutt’s cinematography can be a major resource for your movie. His work provides the film a very sophisticated feel. Art direction is excellent. Sri’s background score is rather good which he’s shipped nicely. Editing is neat. Even production values are also too good here.\n\nFinal Word: Gopichand’s Sahasam is a beautiful movie. Everyone must watch this movie. This is definitely a worthy watch for this rainy weekend.\n\nSahasam Review Rating: 3.25/5"
