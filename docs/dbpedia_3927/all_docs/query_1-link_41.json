        "text": "Advertisement\n\nSahasam Swasaga Sagipo Review, What’s Behind: For technical reasons, this film’s release is long delayed. Banking on ‘Premam’ and Chaitu’s craze, finally the Gautham Vasudev Menon directorial has hit the screen today when people are making long queues before banks for the new currency. Manjima Mohan and AR Rahman are additional attractions. Let’s see how adventurous is this flick?\n\nSahasam Swasaga Sagipo Story: Rajinikanth (Naga Chaitanya) is a graduate guy from Vizag planning to settle in life. His sister Maithreyi’s friend Leela Sathyamurthy (Manjima Mohan) joins the family for a short period pursuing a film making course. Slowly, Rajini and Leela get close and have their beautiful moments in budding love story. Leela joins Rajini on a road trip to Kanya Kumari where the actual problem begins. They face a serious accident and Leela goes missing with her parents attacked somewhere in Maharashtra. Rajini joins Leela in an action filled adventure only to lose his friend Mahesh, Leela’s parents. A crooked police officer Kamath (Baba Sehgal) falls behind them in this chase to save their lives. What is Kamath’s motto behind this operation? Who Leela actually is? What happened to Rajinikanth and Leela’s love story?\n\nSahasam Swasaga Sagipo Artists and Technicians: Basic storyline hasn’t got much juice in it. Gautham Menon makes SSS a more of technician’s flick rather than artists, romance, drama or emotions. A realistic, thrilling screenplay wanders here and there without big purpose ultimately to get senselessly commercialized towards climax. Till the time a teenage boy meeting beautiful girl and development of intimacy is well connected with current generation youth, something like ‘Ye Maya Chesave,’ the film sounds good. Although there is a serious problem in torpid narration part yet technical department and chemistry between lead pair drove off. Later part when adventurous action comes into play, the basic and un-absorbing thrill element hidden till last hour bought in a direct imbalance. The intense action tinge sensed for interval goes dragged and dragged in second half. This is exact area Menon lost the track with a clear mess up and fails as a director. Dialogue writing department had a more casual approach penning lines on lead roles. Dan Macarthur’s camera work is natural and captivating. Anthony’s editing is a comatose. RR had AR Rahman’s trademark while songs aren’t exceptional. Production standards from Ravinder Reddy are also just acceptable.\n\nOnto performances, Naga Chaitanya is again into boy next door looks. His transformation into action, crime mode was cinematic. Manjima Mohan is presented beautifully in a well written characterization. More than two individual artists, Chaitu and Manjima scored high as love birds struck in a crime net. Their chemistry is the saving grace. Baba Sehgal as bad cop irritated. Rest of the artists doesn’t need any mention.\n\nSahasam Swasaga Sagipo Advantages:\n\nChaitu, Manjima Chemistry\n\nCinematography\n\nFirst Half\n\nSahasam Swasaga Sagipo Drawbacks:\n\nSecond Half\n\nStory, Screenplay, Direction\n\nSongs Placement\n\nEditing\n\nMarathi Backdrop\n\nDull Narration\n\nSahasam Swasaga Sagipo Rating Analysis: Typical Menon blended two of his perfectionist movies YMC and Gharshana together into an imperfect SSS. Generally, Menon films have a classy touch emphasized on naturalistic backdrop, character establishments and a typical essence without mass tinge. Unfortunately, one can find many reasons easily behind SSS lying in cans over a period. The film isn’t worth to be called a Menon or Chaitu or Rahman product. Except in bits and pieces of first half, nowhere SSS lived up to expectations.\n\nIntroduction of two lead artists and development of natural chemistry at home (watching the TV at nights) is cute. Till the idea of road trip is put to execution, the film was bearable. On the journey to Kanya Kumari, you feel like the film is tripping away. Yet, a well composed accident episode brings you back at alert. Interval block pulls us into the crime plot without a legitimate reason.\n\nInto second half, Baba Sehgal chasing Chaitu, Manjima and all the action scenes thereof test the patience. How can Menon run off 60 minutes time without a concrete point to discuss? Towards the pre climax, Chaitu becoming an IPS officer is silliest of all. Unveiling of central thrill lock is so feebly dealt and witless. Is this the point we were waiting for? Climax is further stupid. When Chaitu wants to shoot Baba Sehgal, why is he waiting till the end?\n\nAll in all, SSS is a below average film from Menon and his team. In the name of gentle romance and wild crime based action, we are thrown into a 120+ minutes goods train journey off the track. Despite the movie had short run time, one feels like watching a 3+ hour film. CJ rates SSS with pass mark 2 star rating for technicalities (regular Menon mark) and lead pair chemistry. In BO terms, SSS is likely to be a dud in poverty stricken Telugu states reeling in turmoil without valid currency notes.\n\nCinejosh Sahasam Swasaga Sagipo Verdict: Boring Adventure\n\nCinejosh Sahasam Swasaga Sagipo Rating: 2/5"
