        "text": "August Wilhelm von Hofmann (1818 –1892) was a German chemist who is the author of the Hofmann degradation reaction.\n\nGerman chemist Felix Hoffmann (1868–1946) synthesized two drugs: aspirin, one of the most widely beneficial drugs ever, and heroin, one of the most harmful of illegal substances.\n\nAlbert Hofmann (1906 – 2008) became famous for being the first person to synthesize, ingest, and decribe the psychedelic effects of lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD) while working in the Sandoz company in Basel, Switzerland.\n\nKlaus Hofmann (1911– 1995)\n\nScience was his greatest joy and he practiced it with wisdom, intuition and uncompromising honesty. His life was rich with experiences and knowledge that he shared willingly, in his unique style, with those who were fortunate enough to have been his students.\n\nDarleane Hoffman (b. 1926) has chased some of the most elusive forms of matter—the heavy elements over the course of her career."
