This recognition underscores TIMESTONE's commitment to pushing the boundaries of design while prioritizing environmental responsibility. The German Design Award, known for celebrating outstanding design achievements, has bestowed this special mention upon TIMESTONE for its innovative approach to memorializing loved ones. Unlike traditional monuments crafted from imported granite, TIMESTONE's gravestones are crafted from locally sourced clay, setting a new standard in sustainability within the industry. Felix Hoffmann, the german designer who played a pivotal role in the development of these eco-friendly memorials, collaborated closely with Timestone Aps and Designers Trust to bring this vision to life. The result is a harmonious fusion of innovation, elegant design, and environmental responsibility, culminating in a product that stands out in the category of \"Excellent Product Design - Eco Design.\" We would like to say a personal thank you to Nikolaj Tymm-Andersen and Timothy Jacob Jensen for the good cooperation on this project! ðŸŽ‰\n\nTime. Of the many design projects our family has been involved in in the past 102 years, the sustainable tombstone project, TimeStone has been one of the most exciting. Designed through the Designers Trust platform by Felix Hoffmann for TimeStone by Nikolaj Tymm-Andersen and Mikkel Tymm-Andersen. #tombstone #plaque #sustainability #environmentallyfriendly #Design #Designerstrust #danishdesign #scandinaviandesign"
