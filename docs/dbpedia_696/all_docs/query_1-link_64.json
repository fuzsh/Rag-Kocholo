        "text": "Felix Hoffmann- one of Switzerland's most important children's book illustrators of the twentieth century-- brings wonder and intrigue to these classic Brothers Grimm fairy tales: Rapunzel, The Wolf and the Seven Little Kids, Sleeping Beauty, The Seven Ravens, King Thrushbeard, Tom Thumb,and Hans in Luck.\n\nHoffmann's subtle details and keen ability to portray expression in humans and animals alike make this collection a visual treat and one to explore again and again. Seven classic tales are collected with stylish illustrations.\n\n'A welcome introduction to an acclaimed Swiss artist whose work will be new to many young readers.' -- \"Publishers Weekly\"\n\n\"The expressive faces and postures of the animals and the human figures eloquently capture emotion from the fearsome figure of the witch in \"Rapunzel\" to the comical visage of the cow in \"Tom Thumb.\" The illustrations are exquisitely rendered in bright colors and the details are a pleasure to peruse and ponder.\"-- \"School Library Journal\"\n\n\"...a treasure to enjoy with your children and grandchildren and should become a family heirloom to hand down to each new generation.\"-- \"New York Journal of Books\"\n\nFelix Hoffmann (1911-1975) was born in Aarau, Switzerland. He was an illustrator and also painted on glass. He studied at the Academy of Fine Arts Karlsruhe, Germany, and the School of Fine and Applied Arts in Berlin. He illustrated eighty-six books. In 1957 Hoffmann was awarded the Swiss Children's Book Prize for his life's work. He also appeared on the Honors list for the Hans Christian Andersen Award several times, and in 1972 he was short-listed for the same award for his life's work. He is recognized as one of the most important twentieth-century Swiss illustrators of children's books.\n\nJacob and Wilhelm Grimm were born in 1785 and 1786 near Frankfurt, Germany. In their early twenties, they began the linguistic studies that would culminate in their collected editions of folk- and fairy tales. They got their stories from peasants and villagers, and sometimes from already-published works from other cultures. Jacob did much of the research; Wilhelm put the stories into literary form.\n\nTarget Age: 4-8\n\nNorthsouh Books\n\nPub Date: September 05, 2017\n\n1.0\" H x 10.6\" L x 8.4\" W\n\n256 Pages\n\nHardcover"
