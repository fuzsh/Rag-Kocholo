Joined the faculty at the University of Illinois at Urbana in 1916, which he converted into the leading centre of organic chemistry in America. Also forged close links between academia and industry, notably with Du Pont. He also established the series Organic Reactions. His name is associated with chemical warfare agent Adamsite (diphenylamine chloroarsine) and the Adams catalyst (platinum or palladium oxide, used for the hydrogenation of carbon-carbon double bonds).\n\n(Carl Johann Philipp Noé) Richard Anschütz (1852-1937). Born in Darmstadt and initially studied engineering there before switching to chemistry. He took his doctorate at Heidelberg, then worked under Fittig at Tübingen and Kekulé at Bonn, where he remained for the rest of his career. He was interested in stereochemistry and studied the isomerism of unsaturated acids with Kekulé. He also proved the Graebe-Liebermann formula for anthracene by synthesis. Anschütz made a point of teaching chemistry to British POWs in the First World War because of his admiration for Couper's work on chemical structure. In later life he became interested in the history of chemistry. His name is associated with the Anschütz synthesis of anthracenes from substituted benzoyl chlorides.\n\nHis son Ludwig Eduard Heinrich Anschütz (1889-1954) was born in Bonn and studied chemistry at Bonn and Munich before taking his doctorate under K. von Auwers at Marburg. After teaching in Bonn, Berlin and Marburg, he became Professor of Organic Chemistry at the German Technische Hochschule in Brünn, Czechoslovakia.

Born at Alsagers Bank, near Stoke-on-Trent, he studied chemistry at Birmingham and at Imperial College, where he studied under Astbury. He then worked briefly with Edwin Cohn at Harvard Medical School. He then moved to Cambridge, where he remained for the rest of his career. He studied the chemistry of proteins, mechanism of muscle contraction and of blood coagulation, notably myosin and ATPase.\n\nKenneth Claude Bailey (1896-1951). His birthplace is not recorded, but probably Dublin. After serving in the First World War, he won a classical studentship at Trinity College Dublin in 1921 at the height of the troubles, before taking a doctorate in chemistry at the University of Toulouse. He then became a fellow of TCD and subsequently Professor of Physical Chemistry at the University of Dublin. He had two major interests, the chemical writings of the elder Pliny and the inhibition of chemical reactions.\n\nPhilip Sigmon Bailey (b.1916). Born in Chickasha, Oklahoma, he studied chemistry at Oklahoma Baptist University in Shawnee and the University of Oklahoma in Norman.

After taking up a position at Wayne State University in Detroit, Bailey moved to the University of Maryland at College Park. He synthesised monomers for polymerisation studies, developed anionic polymerisation and studied the relationship between the structure of polymers and their properties.\n\nHerbert Brereton Baker (1862-1935). Born in Blackburn, he studied chemistry under Dixon at Balliol College, Oxford. After teaching at Dulwich College, he went back to Oxford as Dr Lees' Reader at Christ Church. He later became Professor of Chemistry at Imperial College. Baker is most famous for his research on the catalytic effect of water on reactions, for instance distilling phosphorous in rigorously dried oxygen without any reaction taking place.\n\nJohn William Baker (1898-1967). Born in London, he went up to Imperial College to study chemistry, but almost immediately became a chemist in the Royal Engineers in Mesopotamia. After returning to Imperial College where he did research under Sir Jocelyn Thorpe, he briefly became a schoolmaster. He then joined Ingold at the University of Leeds, where he remained for the rest of his career. Baker's name is associated with the Baker-Nathan effect, where the reactivity of (e.g.) alkyl chlorides is the opposite of that expected from the inductive effect. Baker and W. S. Nathan incorrectly assumed it was a result of hyperconjugation (a term coined by R. S. Mulliken in 1939), but nowadays it is usually explained by differential solvation. Baker published Hyperconjugation in 1953 and Electronic Theories of Organic Chemistry in 1958. He was an active member of the Chemical Society and the Congregational Church.\n\nPhilip Schaffner Baker (b.1916). Born in Minneapolis, Minnesota, and studied at Occidental College (Los Angeles), Antioch College (Ohio) and DePauw University in Greencastle, Indiana.

His major work was the structure and synthesis of indigo. He also discovered the phthalein dyes and synthesised oxonium compounds. His centric formula for benzene is well-known. Baeyer ennobled by Ludwig II in 1885, and was awarded the Nobel Prize in 1905 for his work on dyes and hydroaromatic compounds. His name is associated with the Baeyer-Drewson indigo synthesis from o-nitrobenzaldehyde, the Baeyer-Villiger oxidation of ketones to esters or lactones, the (discredited) Baeyer photosynthesis equation, the Baeyer strain theory of alicyclic compounds and the Baeyer test for olefins (decolourisation of glacial acetic acid and potassium permanganate).\n\nFriedrich Bayer (originally Beyer) (1825-1880). Born in Barmen, the grandson of a weaver from Nördlingen. He served an apprenticeship as a chemical merchant, then set up his own business. Seeing the potential of the new synthetic dyes, he joined forces with a friend Friedrich Westkott and formed Friedrich Bayer & Cie in Barmen. Initially, the new firm had only one worker, but a chemist was soon hired. A new factory was built near Elberfeld in 1867. By the time of Bayer's death, his firm had become a major dye manufacturer.\n\nKarl Josef Bayer (1847-1904). Born in Bielitz, Silesia, he initially trained as an architect (his father was an architect) before switching to the study of chemistry at Wiesbaden.

Born in Cullom, Illinois, he took his BS degree in chemical engineering at the University of Illinois before taking his Ph.D. at California Institute of Technology in Pasadena. After teaching at Caltech, he founded National Technical Laboratories in South Pasadena in 1935, to make pH meters. NTL became Beckman Instruments in 1950. Beckman Instruments merged with SmithKline in 1982 (it was later demerged), by which time Beckman had already started a new career as a philanthropist, distributing over $300 million through his charitable foundation and thereby establishing numerous institutions including the Beckman Center for the History of Chemistry (now part of the Chemical Heritage Foundation). His name is especially associated with the Model G pH meter and the DU ultraviolet spectrophotometer.\n\nErnst Otto Beckmann (1853-1923). Born in Solingen, he began his career as an pharmacist's assistant in Arolsen, Burg (Wupper), Leipzig and Cologne.

He studied chemistry under Nikolai Nikolaeviè Zinin (1812-1880) and succeeded him as Professor of Chemistry at the St Petersburg Academy of Medicine and Surgery in 1864. He prepared methyl bromide from silver acetate in 1861, but another eighty years elapsed before Heinz and Cläre Hundiecker converted Borodin's synthesis into a general method, the Hunsdiecker or Hunsdiecker-Borodin reaction (1942). Borodin deserves to have more reactions named after him, as he developed general methods of condensing aldehydes and fluoridating organic compounds, a synthesis of fatty acids, and the well-known estimation of urea with hypobromite. He also pioneered the medical and chemical education of women, until the government stopped the teaching of women medical students in 1887. Borodin composed music as a hobby and kept a piano outside his laboratory.\n\nHeinrich Caro (1834-1910). Famous dye chemist and colourist, born in Posen.

Born in Cologne and studied chemistry at Bonn, and briefly at Göttingen. He took his doctorate at Bonn under August Kekulé (1829-1896). Unusually for a German chemist, he then spent four years at Owens College, Manchester (now Manchester University) working with Henry Enfield Roscoe (1833-1915) and Carl Schorlemmer (1834-1892), and then joined Adolf von Baeyer (1835-1917) in Munich. He held Chairs in Organic Chemistry at Aachen Polytechnic and the University of Kiel, before he went to Berlin in 1904 to work with Emil Fischer in Berlin. In addition to the Claisen (1887) and Claisen-Schmidt (1881) condensations, the Claisen rearrangement (1912) and the Claisen isatin synthesis (1879), his name is associated with the Claisen flask and Claisen's rule which relates acidity to enolisation. The Claisen rearrangement has since been \"hyphenated\" to yield the Eschenmoser-Claisen rearrangement (1964), the Johnson-Claisen rearrangement (1970), and the Ireland-Claisen rearrangement (1972).\n\nErik Christian Clemmensen (1876-1941).

Studied chemistry at the university in his home town, Munich, and at Heidelberg. He became a close colleague of Emil Fischer and followed him to the Universities of Erlangen and Würzburg, before being appointed Professor of Chemistry at Jena in 1888. Knorr gave his name to syntheses of pyrazoles (1883), pyrroles (1884) and quinolines (1886). He was the brother-in-law of Oskar Piloty.\n\nHans Meerwein (1879-1965). Born in Hamburg, the son of a architect, he studied chemistry at the Fresenius chemistry school in Wiesbaden before going to Bonn. After taking his doctorate at the polytechnic in Berlin-Charlottenburg, he returned to Bonn. He later held Chairs at Königsberg and Marburg. Meerwein's main interest was carbonium ion chemistry and carbonium ion polymerisation. The chemical giant I.G. Farben was very interested in his research and funded his work generously. In 1914, during his study of the pinacol-pinacolone rearrangement, he generalised Egor Vagner's mechanism for the conversion of a-pinene into bornyl chloride (Wagner-Meerwein rearrangement). Meerwein's name is also associated with the Meerwein methylation, the Meerwein arylation (1939) and Meerwein-Ponndorf-Verley reduction (1925-6).\n\nArthur Michael (1855-1942). Born in Buffalo and studied chemistry at Heidelberg under Robert Bunsen (1811-1899) and at Berlin under August Wilhelm Hofmann (1818-1892). He then studied under Adolphe Wurtz (1817-1884) in Paris and Dimitri Ivanoviè Mendeleev (1834-1907) in St Petersburg, but never bothered to take a degree. He was made Professor of Chemistry at Tufts College near Boston. In 1889, he married one of his most brilliant students, Helen Cecilia DeSilver Abbott (1857-1904), one of the few women organic chemists in this period. After a failed attempt to run the chemistry department at Clark University in Worcester, Massachusetts, in 1891, he spent three years working with his wife in his private laboratory on the Isle of Wight before returning to Tufts. After he retired from Tufts in 1907, Michael set up another private laboratory at Newton Center near Boston. Five years later, he was appointed a Professor of Chemistry, without lecturing duties, at Harvard University.\n\nOskar Piloty (1866-1915). Was the son of an artist and was educated at the university in his home town of Munich, under Adolf von Baeyer and later married Baeyer's daughter. Piloty was also the brother-in-law of Ludwig Knorr (1859-1921). He took his doctorate under Emil Fischer in Würzburg and followed Fischer to Berlin. In 1899, he joined his father-in-law in Munich as Professor of Inorganic Chemistry. Piloty initially focussed on sugar chemistry, but later turned his attention to the structure of the natural pyrroles. After one of his sons was killed in the early days of the First World War, Piloty volunteered to serve at the western front, and was killed by a bullet while on duty at the front near the Somme.\n\nSergei Nikolaeviè Reformatski (1860-1934). Born in Borisoglebskoe, near Ivanovo (which later became a centre of the Soviet petrochemical industry with the help of Zelinski), and studied chemistry under Aleksandr Michailoviè Sayteff or Zajcev (1841-1910) at Kazan, before travelling to Heidelberg and Leipzig. He took his doctorate at the University of Warsaw. Reformatski was Professor of Organic Chemistry at the University of Kiev for over forty years and was also associated with the development of the Soviet synthetic rubber industry in the 1930s. His synthesis of a-hydroxy esters (1887) has remained popular.\n\nKarl Ludwig Reimer (1845-1883). Born in Leipzig, but grew up in Berlin. He studied chemistry at Göttingen, Griefswald and Heidelberg, and took his doctorate under August Wilhem Hofmann (1818-1892) in 1871. He then entered industry, but continued his research. In 1876, he discovered a new synthesis of salicylaldehyde from phenol, which he developed in collaboration with his former Berlin colleague Ferdinand Tiemann (1848-1899). Reimer soon dropped out of this research, presumably to concentrate on the development of Haarmann and Reimer of Holzminden, founded in 1876 and now part of Bayer. His place was taken by Karl Ludwig Reimer (1856-1921).\n\nKarl Ludwig Reimer (1856-1921). Was also the son of a Berlin publisher and may have been a relative. The younger Reimer also went into industry after taking his doctorate and eventually worked in the potash industry at Stassfurt.\n\nTraugott Sandmeyer (1854-1922). Born in Wettingen near Zurich, and lived in the Zurich area for nearly all of his life. He trained as a precision instrument-maker, but became interested in chemistry. Self-educated in chemistry, he carried out chemical experiments in his kitchen. In 1881, he became a lecture assistant to Victor Meyer (1848-1897). He followed Meyer to Göttingen in 1886, but soon returned to Zurich and worked for Arthur Hantzsch (1857-1935). Sandmeyer joined Geigy as a research scientist in 1888, and eventually became a director of the firm. He discovered the decomposition of aryl diazonium chlorides to chloroarenes in the presence of copper (I) chloride in 1884. He also worked on the triphenylmethane dyes and the synthesis of isatin. Many years before, he had suggested to Victor Meyer an impurity in commerical benzene was responsible for the isatin reaction with sulphuric acid, thereby paving the way for Meyer's discovery of thiophen.\n\nKarl-Friedrich Schmidt (1887-1971). Born in Heidelberg and studied chemistry in his home town and at the University of Munich, before taking his doctorate under Theodor Curtius (1857-1928) at Heidelberg. He became Professor of Organic Chemistry at the Swedish University at Åbo (or Turku) in Finland in 1922, returning to Heidelberg three years later. He then became a board director of the pharmaceutical firm Chemische Fabrik Knoll of Ludwigshafen, but set up his own laboratory in 1936.\n\nHans Stobbe (1860-1938). Born in Tiegenhof, near Danzig, and was educated at Heidelburg, Munich, Strassburg and Leipzig, finally switching to chemistry under the influence of Johannes Wislicenus. He became Professor of Organic Chemistry at Leipzig in 1904, after the death of Wislicenus. Stobbe was not only one of the founders of physical organic chemistry, but also a pioneer of polymer chemistry, and he investigated the polymerisation of styrene as early as 1909. Between 1928 and 1938, Stobbe was an editor of \"Poggendorff\" (properly speaking the Biographisch-Literarisches Handwörterbuch). His name is associated with the Stobbe condensation of diethyl succinate (1893).\n\nAdolph Strecker (1822-1871). Born in Darmstadt, the son of an archivist, and studied chemistry at Giessen under his fellow Darmstadter Justus von Liebig (1803-1873). He then became Professor of Chemistry at the University of Kristiania (Oslo), moving to Tübingen in 1860 and to Würzburg ten years later. Strecker synthesised alanine from acetaldehyde via its condensation product with ammonia and hydrogen cyanide in 1850. Twenty-five years later, Emil Erlenmeyer (1825-1909) developed this reaction into a general synthesis of amino-acids, and showed that the intermediate was probably the á-aminonitrile. It remains very popular today, nearly one and a half centuries after its initial appearance. Strecker also synthesised taurine and organometallic compounds of mercury, antimony and tin. His name is also associated with the Strecker degradation (1862) of á-amino-acids, and the Strecker sulphite alkylation (1868), a result of his work on alizarin.\n\nJohann Carl Wilhelm Ferdinand Tiemann (1848-1899). Born in Rübeland, in the Harz, and originally trained as a pharmacist at the polytechnic in Brunswick. He then switched to chemistry and worked as an assistant to August Wilhelm Hofmann (1818-1892), preparing TNT for the first time in 1870. Tiemann became a silent partner to Haarmann in Holzminden and Georges de Laire (1836-1908) in Paris, and carried out research on fragrances. He later elucidated the structure of the interrelated terpenes. His name is associated with the Reimer-Tiemann reaction (1876) and the Tiemann rearrangement of amide oxides (1891).\n\nEgor Egoroviè Vagner (1849-1903). Born in Kazan. He initially trained at the University of Kazan to become a lawyer like his father, but soon switched to chemistry, probably under the influence of another Kazan native Aleksandr Michailoviè Sayteff or Zajcev (1841-1910). He then went to the University of St Petersburg, and Institute of Forestry and Agriculture in Novo-Aleksandria (near Lublin) before taking up a Chair in Organic Chemistry at the University of Warsaw. He soon transferred his chair to the new polytechnic in Warsaw. Initially Vagner prepared secondary alcohols using zinc alkyls, but soon switched to terpene chemistry. In the course of this work, he suggested in 1899, that the formation of bornyl chloride from á-pinene involved an internal rearrangment. In 1914, this reaction was generalised by Hans Meerwein (1879-1965) as the Wagner-Meerwein rearrangement. Vagner used the German spelling of his name in papers published in German journals.\n\nVictor Villiger (1868-1934). Born in the Swiss village of Cham am Zuger See in the Aarau, and studied chemistry under Carl Graebe (1841-1927) at the University of Geneva. After his military service, Villiger went to Munich to work with Adolf von Baeyer. Baeyer was very pleased with his new assistant and they worked together for eleven years. In 1904, Villiger decided to become a research chemist at BASF, a firm with close links with Baeyer. At BASF in Ludwigshafen, he initially worked with August Bernthsen (1855-1931) on thiazin and oxazin dyestuffs, and later joined the central research laboratory. His name is associated with the still popular Baeyer-Villiger oxidation of ketones (1899).\n\nJacob Volhard (1834-1910). Born in Darmstadt and he studied chemistry at Giessen under his fellow Darmstadter Justus von Liebig, whom he followed to Munich. After working in London (under Hofmann) and Marburg (under Kolbe), he became Professor of Organic Chemistry at Munich, briefly at Erlangen and finally in Halle. Volhard is best known for his development of volumetric analysis, notably the titration of silver with ammonium thiocyanate, but he also synthesised creatine in 1868. His name is associated with the Hell-Volhard-Zelinski bromination (1881-1887) and the Volhard-Erdmann cyclisation (1885).\n\nvon Hell see Hell\n\nGertrude Maude Walsh (1886-1954). Born in Over near Manchester, the daughter of a coal salesman, and studied chemistry at Manchester University, where she worked under Chaim Weizmann (1874-1952). She then joined the research group of Robert Robinson (1886-1975) and married him in 1912. She continued her research alongside her husband and did some important work on plant pigments and penicillin. Her name is associated (with her husband) with the Piloty-Robinson reaction (1910, 1918).\n\nWagner see also Vagner\n\nTheodor Wagner-Jauregg (b.1903). Born in Vienna, the son of Leopold Wagner-Jauregg, the Nobel Laureate for medicine in 1927. He studied chemistry at the Universities of Vienna and Munich, before working with Richard Kuhn (1900-1967) in Zurich. He taught at Heidelberg before taking up a position at the Georg-Speyer-Haus research institute in Frankfurt in 1936. After the war, Wagner-Jauregg was transferred by the US Army to the United States, one of the few German chemists to co-operate with \"Operation Paperclip\". He worked in the US Chemical Corps at Edgewood Arsenal in Maryland. In 1955, he went to Switzerland to become research director of a small pharmaceutical company. The Wagner-Jauregg reaction (1930), the addition of maleic anhydride to 1,1-diarylethenes, is fairly obscure, and is usually considered to be a special case of the Diels-Alder reaction.\n\nLudwig Wolff (1857-1919). Born in Neustadt in the Palatinate and was educated at the University of Würzburg and Munich Polytechnic. He was one of the ambitious young German chemists who flocked to the recently Germanised University of Strassburg, where Rudolf Fittig (1835-1910) and Adolf von Baeyer were professors and Emil Fischer was a fellow student. In 1891, he became Professor of Analytical Chemistry at Jena, where he worked with Ludwig Knorr. His name is associated with the Wolff-Kishner reaction (1911-2) and the Wolff rearrangement (1912).\n\nNikolai Dimitrieviè Zelinski (1861-1953). Born in Tiraspol near Kishinev in Bessarabia and educated at the University of Odessa, before studying at Leipzig and Göttingen. After taking his doctorate at Odessa, he became Professor of Organic and Analytical Chemistry at the University of Moscow. In 1911, he resigned in protest at the government's education policies, like Borodin he was a strong supporter of women's education, and became director of a government laboratory in St Petersburg. After the revolution in 1917, he returned to Moscow University, where he helped to develop the Soviet petrochemical and synthetic rubber industries. His name is associated with the Hell-Volhard-Zelinski bromination (1881-1887)."
