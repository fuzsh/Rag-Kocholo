        "text": "The United States Bicentennial was a series of events in celebration of the nation’s 200th birthday. Official events began on April 1, 1975 with the launch of the American Freedom Train 21-month tour of the 48 contiguous states. Later that month, President Gerald Ford visited the Old North Church in Boston, Massachusetts, where he lit a third lantern in recognition of the country’s third century. He then delivered a major address at Lexington and Concord commemorating the 200th anniversary of the battles that spurred the Revolutionary War.\n\nThe American Revolution Bicentennial Administration focused on supporting local celebrations, with around 66,000 recognized events in total. There were picnics, ceremonies, presentations, and numerous other festivities across the country. Bicentennial celebrations were not limited to the United States: An exhibition titled The World of Franklin and Jefferson first opened in Paris, France before travelling throughout Europe and the US.\n\nThe Bicentennial was also commemorated by two official state visits. In May 1976, President and Mrs. d’Estaing of France visited the US in recognition of the history of friendship between the two countries. Two months later, in July 1976, Queen Elizabeth II and Prince Phillip of Great Britain toured Philadelphia, DC, Virginia, New York, Connecticut, and Massachusetts. On behalf of the British people, the Queen gifted to the US the Bicentennial Bell, a replica of the Liberty Bell that hangs at Independence Hall in Philadelphia."
