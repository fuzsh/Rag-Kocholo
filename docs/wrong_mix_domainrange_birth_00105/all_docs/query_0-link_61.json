        "text": "Time and Chance: Gerald Ford's Appointment with History\n\nBy James Cannon,\n\nWhy did I love this book?\n\nI recommend this book with some caution, as Cannon worked for Ford, and sometimes authors who are too close to their subject will oversee their faults. But what makes Cannon’s work a must-read—and why I found it so helpful to my own research on Ford—is that he was one of the first to devote extensive attention to Ford’s pre-presidential years. Furthermore, he relied not only on archival materials but on dozens of interviews he conducted with people who knew and worked for Ford, as well as interviews with the former president himself.\n\nBy James Cannon,\n\nWhy should I read it?\n\n1 author picked Time and Chance as one of their favorite books, and they share why you should read it.\n\nWhat is this book about?\n\nGerald Ford came to the presidency at the time of one of our nation's greatest constitutional crises, the downfall of President Richard M. Nixon in the aftermath of the Watergate affair. His service as president concluded a distinguished career in the House of Representatives during which he served as leader of the Republican Party in the House. With unrestricted access to Gerald Ford's papers, James M. Cannon tells the story of Ford's rise and Nixon's ruin, providing new insights into this troubling period of our history and Ford's role in guiding the nation through it. Cannon tells the story of…\n\nPreview\n\nWrite It When I'm Gone: Remarkable Off-The-Record Conversations with Gerald R. Ford\n\nBy Thomas M. DeFrank,\n\nWhy did I love this book?\n\nDeFrank was a correspondent for Newsweek magazine who spoke extensively with Ford, with the understanding that he was not to publish those conversations until after Ford’s passing. Ford openly describes his difficulties with President Richard Nixon and his dislike for Ronald Reagan, whom Ford believed should have done more to help him win the 1976 presidential election. Maybe most fascinating was his criticism of Dick Cheney, who had served as Ford’s chief of staff and who, as President George W. Bush’s vice president, pushed for the invasion of Iraq in 2003—something that Ford felt was a mistake.\n\nBy Thomas M. DeFrank,\n\nWhy should I read it?\n\n1 author picked Write It When I'm Gone as one of their favorite books, and they share why you should read it. This book is for kids age 14.\n\nWhat is this book about?\n\nThe New York Times bestseller?and the candid voice of an American president\n\nIn 1974, Newsweek correspondent Thomas M. DeFrank was interviewing Gerald Ford when the Vice President blurted out something astonishingly indiscreet. He then extracted a promise not to publish it. ?Write it when I?m dead,? Ford said? and thus began a thirty-two-year relationship.\n\nDuring the last fifteen years of their conversations, Ford opened up to DeFrank, speaking in a way few presidents ever have. Here the award-winning journalist reveals these private talks, as Ford discusses his experiences with his fellow presidents, the Warren Commission, and his exchanges with Bill…\n\nPreview\n\nA Time to Heal: The Autobiography of Gerald R. Ford\n\nBy Gerald R. Ford,\n\nWhy did I love this book?\n\nWhile any reader should be cautious with memoirs, what they tell you—or, conversely, omit—can offer great insight into what the writer believed and did. Researched and co-authored by Trevor Ambrister, A Time to Heal is at some points disjointed. However, its value is in Ford’s telling of his upbringing, his relationship with his wife, Betty, his ambitiousness to rise up the political ranks, the challenges he faced as president, and his failure to win the presidency in 1976.\n\nBy Gerald R. Ford,\n\nWhy should I read it?\n\n1 author picked A Time to Heal as one of their favorite books, and they share why you should read it.\n\nWhat is this book about?\n\nBrand new copy still shrink wrapped - sealed from Easton Press. Signed copy.\n\nPreview\n\nThe Times of My Life\n\nBy Betty Ford, Chris Chase,\n\nWhy did I love this book?\n\nWhile Gerald Ford’s memoir is useful, I liked Betty’s even more because of her candor. She tells the story of the wife of a congressman, vice president, and president who struggled with loneliness as her husband focused on climbing up the political ranks. His absenteeism contributed to her struggles with alcoholism and drug addiction. Suddenly thrust into the role of First Lady, Betty publicized her fight against breast cancer—a disease that up to that point had received little public attention—and sought to walk the fine line between acting as White House hostess and drawing attention to issues of women’s rights.\n\nBy Betty Ford, Chris Chase,\n\nWhy should I read it?\n\n1 author picked The Times of My Life as one of their favorite books, and they share why you should read it.\n\nWhat is this book about?\n\nThis former First Lady candidly describes her life, her unhappy first marriage, her courtship and marriage with Gerald Ford, their independent children, and her battle with cancer\n\nPreview\n\nGerald R. Ford: The 38th President, 1974-1977\n\nBy Douglas G. Brinkley,\n\nWhy did I love this book?\n\nThere are a number of studies of Ford’s presidency, but there are two reasons why I picked Brinkley’s. First, his was the first book published following Ford’s passing and, consequently, the first full biography of the thirty-eighth president. Second,Gerald R. Ford is part of a series on the presidents published by The New York Times that are specifically aimed at a general audience. While each of the books is short and, therefore, selective insofar as coverage, they are well-written and informative.\n\nBy Douglas G. Brinkley,\n\nWhy should I read it?\n\n1 author picked Gerald R. Ford as one of their favorite books, and they share why you should read it.\n\nWhat is this book about?\n\nThe \"accidental\" president whose innate decency and steady hand restored the presidency after its greatest crisis\n\nWhen Gerald R. Ford entered the White House in August 1974, he inherited a presidency tarnished by the Watergate scandal, the economy was in a recession, the Vietnam War was drawing to a close, and he had taken office without having been elected. Most observers gave him little chance of success, especially after he pardoned Richard Nixon just a month into his presidency, an action that outraged many Americans, but which Ford thought was necessary to move the nation forward.\n\nMany people today think…\n\nPreview\n\nYou might also like...\n\nLeora's Letters: The Story of Love and Loss for an Iowa Family During World War II\n\nBy Joy Neal Kidney, Robin Grunder,\n\nNew book alert!\n\nSponsored by Joy Neal Kidney Author\n\nWhy am I passionate about this?\n\nI'm the oldest granddaughter of Leora, who lost three sons during WWII. To learn what happened to them, I studied casualty and missing aircraft reports, missions reports, and read unit histories. I’ve corresponded with veterans who knew one of the brothers, who witnessed the bomber hit the water off New Guinea, and who accompanied one brother’s body home. I’m still in contact with the family members of two crew members on the bomber. The companion book, Leora’s Letters, is the family story of the five Wilson brothers who served, but only two came home.\n\nJoy's book list on research of World War II casualties\n\nWhat is my book about?\n\nThe day the second atomic bomb was dropped, Clabe and Leora Wilson’s postman brought a telegram to their acreage near Perry, Iowa. One son was already in the U.S. Navy before Pearl Harbor had been attacked. Four more sons worked with their father, tenant farmers near Minburn until, one by one; all five sons were serving their country in the military–two in the Navy and three as Army Air Force pilots.\n\nOnly two sons came home.\n\nLeora’s Letters is the compelling true account of a woman whose most tender hopes were disrupted by great losses. Yet she lived out four…\n\nBy Joy Neal Kidney, Robin Grunder,\n\nWhy should I read it?\n\n1 author picked Leora's Letters as one of their favorite books, and they share why you should read it.\n\nWhat is this book about?\n\nThe day the second atomic bomb was dropped, Clabe and Leora Wilson’s postman brought a telegram to their acreage near Perry, Iowa.
