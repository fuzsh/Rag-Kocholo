        "text": "Even though Massachusetts hockey fans are still bitter about the embarrassing and tragic end to the historic Boston Bruins season, true fans are already counting down the days til next season.\n\nThe legendary Boston Bruins have quite a colorful history of amazing players, but let's face it, the majority of the NHL is made up of players from other counties, like Sweden, Russia, Finland the Czech Republic, and of course, Canada. In fact, only 27% of professional hockey players in the NHL are from the U.S. according to CTV News with data collected from the National Hockey League. Of those U.S.-born players, only 11% are from Massachusetts, behind Minnesota, Michigan, and New York.\n\nWhen a Massachusetts player makes it to the NHL it's a big deal, when they get to skate for their home team the Boston Bruins, it's magical.\n\nHere are seven of the most popular players born in Massachusetts who laced up their skates for the Big Bad Bruins. Who is your favorite? Can you think of any we missed?"
