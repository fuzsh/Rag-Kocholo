        "text": "Served: August 9, 1974 – January 20, 1977\n\nBorn: July 14, 1913\n\nBirthplace: Omaha, Nebraska\n\nDied: December 26, 2006\n\nOccupation: Lawyer\n\nPolitical Party: Republican\n\nSpouse: Betty Bloomer\n\nA President Bypasses Elections\n\nAs the 38th president of the United States, Gerald Ford overtook the presidency after Richard Nixon’s resignation due to the Watergate scandal.\n\nBefore becoming president, Ford was vice president, a position he was appointed to when Spiro Agnew resigned under Nixon’s presidency. He was the only president to be appointed to both positions without being elected.\n\nFord Takes on Athletics\n\nFord had a difficult childhood. His mother suffered domestic violence at the hands of his father, and the couple separated when Ford was young. His mother later remarried, and Ford took his stepfather’s name.\n\nIn high school, Ford was captain of the football team and a star athlete. He graduated from college with an economics degree in 1935 and received contract offers from the Detroit Lions and the Green Bay Packers. Instead, he chose a coaching position at Yale and applied to its law school.\n\nIn 1941, on his graduation from Yale, he was admitted to the Michigan bar. That same year, he opened a law practice, but because of the attack on Pearl Harbor, he left his practice and enlisted in the Navy.\n\nA Controversial Pardon\n\nFord began his political career as a representative from Michigan. He served about 25 years in this position, including eight years as the Republican minority leader.\n\nIn 1974, Vice President Ford was appointed president immediately after Nixon’s resignation. This marked the second time in his career that Ford was called on to take over a legislative position.\n\nDuring Ford’s presidency, the U.S. suffered a terrible economy, the worst one since the Great Depression almost four decades earlier.\n\nOne of Ford’s first acts as president was signing the Helsinki Accords, designed to improve relations with Communist Europe. Additionally, Ford became embroiled in controversy early on when he granted a presidential pardon of Nixon.\n\nIn 1976, Ford was again nominated as the Republican presidential candidate. However, he lost the election to Jimmy Carter, a Democrat.\n\nDid You Know…?"
