        "text": "Transcript\n\nNARRATOR: Gerald R. Ford—the 38th president of the United States—took office after President Richard M. Nixon resigned in 1974. Ford is the only chief executive who was not elected as either president or vice president.\n\nFord grew up in Grand Rapids, Michigan, and became a football star at the University of Michigan. He played on the school's 1932 and 1933 national championship teams and was named Most Valuable Player his senior year. The Green Bay Packers and Detroit Lions offered him professional contracts, but he chose to study law instead.\n\nWhile attending law school, Ford dabbled in modeling with his girlfriend of the time. In 1940 \"Look\" magazine featured the pair in a photo spread that followed them on a weekend ski date. First lady Betty Ford was also a former model as well as a dancer.\n\nFord served in the navy during World War II, which broadened his view of the world and inspired him to enter politics. He began representing Michigan in the House of Representatives in 1949 and became the House minority leader in 1965.\n\nIn 1973 Vice President Spiro T. Agnew resigned because of legal troubles. President Richard Nixon selected Ford to fill the vacancy, believing him to be the only candidate that the Democratic leadership of Congress would approve. Eight months later Nixon resigned over the Watergate scandal and Ford rose to the presidency. In his remarks after taking the oath of office, Ford spoke of his desire to bring integrity back to the White House.\n\nGERALD R. FORD: I have not sought this enormous responsibility, but I will not shirk it. . . . In all my public and private acts as your president, I expect to follow my instincts of openness and candor with full con—confidence that honesty is always the best policy in the end. My fellow Americans, our long national nightmare is over.\n\nNARRATOR: President Ford granted Nixon a full pardon for all crimes that he might have committed in office, hoping to move the country past the Watergate scandal. Instead, many people criticized this decision as violating the principle of equal justice under the law, because it prevented Nixon from being tried in court.\n\nPresident Ford also extended conditional amnesty to men who had evaded military service during the Vietnam War. That conflict officially ended during Ford's administration.\n\nWhen he took office, Ford inherited a struggling economy, with rising inflation and a high unemployment rate. He brought together congressional leaders and representatives of labor, industry, and agriculture to devise recovery strategies.\n\nGERALD R. FORD: There's only one point on which all advisers have agreed: We must whip inflation right now.\n\nNARRATOR: Ford's Whip Inflation Now, or WIN, program sought to reduce inflation by slowing down the economy. It relied upon several voluntary measures to hold down prices and wages. But the program created new economic problems, and it was soon abandoned.\n\nBy the time of the 1976 presidential election, Ford's policies had brought steady improvement to the economy, but unemployment remained high. Between the economy and the unpopularity of his decision to pardon Nixon, Ford failed to win reelection, losing to Jimmy Carter.\n\nAfter leaving office, Ford spent his time golfing, skiing, and lecturing on politics. He also served on the boards of directors of numerous corporations until his death in 2006."
