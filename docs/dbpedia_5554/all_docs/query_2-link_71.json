        "text": "On the Verge: Tegan and Sara get 'Closer' to stardom\n\nSister act: Tegan and Sara Quin may be identical twins, but the Canadian sisters who are climbing the pop charts with the euphoric electro-pop single Closer share no mystical bond. \"We can't read each other's minds,\" says Tegan, 33, the older by eight minutes. \"And I can assure you, if you hit her, I don't feel it.\"\n\nMoving Closer to the mainstream: Closer is the first U.S. radio hit for the sisters, who historically have taken a \"very '90s DIY, dubbing-cassette-tapes-and-selling-them-at-school approach\" to their career, says Sara. The single, No. 17 on USA TODAY's top 40 airplay chart, has sold 405,000 downloads, according to Nielsen SoundScan. Latest album Heartthrob made its debut at No. 3 on Billboard's album chart in January, selling 49,000 copies in its first week. \"When I listen to our previous efforts, I love those records, but I get why people didn't play them on the radio,\" Sara says. While the duo built a dedicated cult following over the course of six earlier albums, with Heartthrob, \"we knew we wanted to do something that didn't close doors immediately.\"\n\nRock 'n' roll high school: Tegan and Sara made their first recordings during a communications and broadcasting class in high school. \"We started to get really distracted in our senior year, and our teacher needed to rein us in, so he suggested the class engineer some demo tapes for us,\" Tegan says. \"That's when we first realized there was genuine interest from people around us in the songs we were writing.\"\n\nThe Taylor Swift connection: Not long after the duo performed Closer with Taylor Swift at one of Swift's Los Angeles concerts in August, Sara was approached at the Portland, Ore., airport by a 9-year-old autograph seeker who'd attended the show. \"This is the first time in our career where our audience is not our peers,\" Sara says.\n\nTwins piqued: Pop music has a rich history of brother acts who come to blows â€” Phil and Don Everly, The Kinks' Ray and Dave Davies, Oasis' Liam and Noel Gallagher. When sisters fight, \"it's more psychological warfare,\" Tegan says. \"It's easy to punish someone you know won't leave you.\""
