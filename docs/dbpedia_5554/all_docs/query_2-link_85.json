A few years ago, they explored those early days in a memoir they wrote together, called High School, and last year, they turned that memoir into a TV show of the same name. They also released their first album of all-new music since 2016, called Crybaby, that sees them dealing with big life changes and continuing to \"grow up\" together as sisters and artists."
