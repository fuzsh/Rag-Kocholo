        "text": "Everything is awesome for Tegan and Sara\n\nFew pop makeovers are so smooth — and so successful — as that of Tegan and Sara Quin. The identical twin Canadians released a string of albums at the turn of the century full of rough, angry alternative folk, placing them squarely with the then-huge Lilith Fair bunch. But starting with 2007's \"The Con,\" each record has edged closer to savvy pop perfection, culminating in last year's \"Heartthrob,\" a slick, undeniably fun party disc capped by lead single, \"Closer,\" which topped Billboard's dance charts.\n\nBut the transformation wasn't complete until this year, with the sisters' collaboration with Andy Samberg's The Lonely Island for \"The Lego Movie,\" called \"Everything Is AWESOME!!!\" We talked to Tegan about the beauty of pop, dream collaborators and, of course, awesomeness. All exclamation points are hers.\n\n\"Heartthrob\" is your most overtly poppy, danceable record yet. Who does pop the best?\n\nCyndi Lauper, David Bowie, Bruce Springsteen. And more recently, I love watching artists like Katy Perry, Miley Cyrus, Madonna and even Coldplay put on giant shows. They have the ability to entertain tens of thousands of people who are all different.\n\nWould the Tegan and Sara of 15 years ago have believed that your music would be huge in dance clubs?\n\nI think the us of 15 years ago may not have had the foresight to imagine we'd be crossing genres at some pointin our career. That being said, we did encourage dance remixes of our songs as early as 2004. And in 2006, we collaborated with Tiesto. And we grewup in the rave scene. We were punk kids who danced at raves. We've always been a bit hard to pin down.\n\nFrom James Iha (of The Smashing Pumpkins) and David Guetta to Against Me! you guys seem to love collaborating. Who are some artists still on your wish list?\n\nWe're really interested in working with more women! Taylor Swift, Katy Perry. Maybe we'll get into country writing? I love the idea of learning. The more we collaborate, the more we learn about our own abilities as songwriters.\n\nSo who approached whom to create \"Everything is AWESOME!!!\"? Can you tell me a bit about working with The Lonely Island?\n\nOur managers asked if we were interested in singing a song for \"The Lego Movie.\" We didn't know much more than that at first. I flew to LA and recorded the main vocals with Mark Mothersbaugh from Devo! And Sara recorded her parts in New York City. We never actually were in the studio with The Lonely Island. They recorded their parts from elsewhere, too! A true modern creation!\n\nIf everything is, in fact, awesome, what is the most awesome breakfast you recently ate?\n\nAn egg white omelet with goat cheese, chicken and jalapeno!\n\nThe most awesome thing you read in the news recently?\n\nThe news drives me crazy. So much negative stuff.\n\nThe most awesome thing about your sister?\n\nHer sense of humor!\n\nTegan & Sara\n\n> WHEN: 7:30 p.m. May 10\n\n> WHEN: Egyptian Room at Old National Centre, 502 N. New Jersey St.\n\n> COST: $30"
