Amazon Studios and Plan B Entertainment, Brad Pitt’s production company, are also involved.\n\nWe apologize, but this video has failed to load.\n\nTry refreshing your browser, or\n\ntap here to see other videos from our team.\n\nTegan and Sara to turn Calgary-set memoir, High School, into TV series Back to video\n\nAdvertisement 2\n\nStory continues below\n\nThis advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\n\nTHIS CONTENT IS RESERVED FOR SUBSCRIBERS ONLY\n\nSubscribe now to read the latest news in your city and across Canada.\n\nUnlimited online access to articles from across Canada with one account.\n\nGet exclusive access to the Calgary Herald ePaper, an electronic replica of the print edition that you can share, download and comment on.\n\nEnjoy insights and behind-the-scenes analysis from our award-winning journalists.\n\nSupport local journalists and the next generation of journalists.\n\nDaily puzzles including the New York Times Crossword.\n\nSUBSCRIBE TO UNLOCK MORE ARTICLES\n\nSubscribe now to read the latest news in your city and across Canada.\n\nUnlimited online access to articles from across Canada with one account.\n\nGet exclusive access to the Calgary Herald ePaper, an electronic replica of the print edition that you can share, download and comment on.\n\nEnjoy insights and behind-the-scenes analysis from our award-winning journalists.\n\nSupport local journalists and the next generation of journalists.\n\nDaily puzzles including the New York Times Crossword.\n\nREGISTER / SIGN IN TO UNLOCK MORE ARTICLES\n\nCreate an account or sign in to continue with your reading experience.\n\nAccess articles from across Canada with one account.\n\nShare your thoughts and join the conversation in the comments.\n\nEnjoy additional articles per month.\n\nGet email updates from your favourite authors.\n\nSign In or Create an Account\n\nEmail Address\n\nor\n\nArticle content\n\nThe Quin sisters will be executive producers of the series.\n\nHigh School covers the formative years of the Quin sisters, who have gone onto Grammy-winning superstardom as Tegan & Sara. The book, which was released last year, highlights the twins’ years at Crescent Heights high school, chronicling their early romances, family life, early musical career and coming to terms with their sexuality.\n\nThe series has been described as “a transcendent story of first loves and first songs. Through a backdrop of ’90s grunge and rave culture, the series tangles itself in the parallel and discordant memories of two sisters growing up down the hall from one another.”\n\nDuVall is known for roles in 1999’s Girl, Interrupted and 2012 Argo. She has recently been seen in the HBO series Veep and The Handmaid’s Tale. She also co-created the upcoming Fox animated series Housebroken.\n\nWhen contacted by Postmedia, representatives from Tegan and Sara’s management said the series is still in its early stages and no decision about where it will be filmed has been made.\n\nTegan and Sara will hold a free online event hosted by author and musician Vivek Shraya for Wordfest to talk about their memoir and celebrate its launch in paperback on Oct. 29 at 7 p.m. Visit wordfest.com for more details.\n\nArticle content\n\nShare this article in your social network\n\nLatest National Stories"
