        "text": "In 2008 the band I was in was coming to an end and I was questioning whether or not I would continue making music. When I heard Tegan and Sara's album The Con it walloped me over the brow.\n\nThe lyrics resonated for me. When Tegan sings “everyone I love, get back from me now” or when Sara tries to understand why people have a problem with her sexuality, “I look into the mirror/ for evil that just does not exist”, you can really hear their emotions. The feelings of loss I heard on the record helped me realise that the acute pain of letting go of my band was very much like a break-up.\n\nElectronic indie-pop wasn't a genre I had considered much before. I was curious about how Tegan and Sara breathed new life into their music and ended up with this really fresh sounding electro-pop. The album was produced by Chris Walla (Death Cab for Cutie) who apparently was responsible for the addition of all these new synth and electronic sounds.\n\nI hadn't been stirred by an album so quickly in a long time and I immediately fell in love with making music again and found my sound. That has stayed with me and I try to seek a piano hook in everything I do now with Pursued by Dogs. Even though it's 11 years old, The Con isn't out of place with the female pop/indie/electronic vibe happening now. Check out Back in My Head – a finer electro-pop tune you'll never hear. – In conversation with Niall Byrne"
