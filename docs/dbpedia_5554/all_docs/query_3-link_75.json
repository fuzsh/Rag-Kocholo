        "text": "Born and raised in Oakland, CA and currently based in LA, King Isis (they/she) shifts shapes and fuses sounds ranging from rock and R&B to jazz and blues, sweeping through pain, growth, and transformation.\n\nMusic has been in King Isis' blood for generations. They were taught on the piano of their great-great-grandmother Omega King, one of the first Black opera singers in Chicago. Stifled by years of stringent classic training, they began to explore alternative worlds. A counter-culture weirdo, King Isis creates for those outside the margins.\n\nLadyRyan is a Bay Area favorite, inspiring a sense of safety, joy, and belonging as a spiritual conductor and dedicated professional. Her music and voice have been riding the wave of partygoers from coast to coast for more than a decade.\n\nHer passion for music started at an early age, singing in her church choir at 6, sampling and making beats at 20, and ultimately tapping into her true passion when she bought her first set of turntables at 23. LadyRyan’s deep range of knowledge in multiple musical genres, balanced with the right touch makes her ability to conduct high vibrations a sure shot!\n\nLadyRyan has played with and opened for artists such as George Clinton, Erykah Badu, and Anderson .Paak. In 2011, LadyRyan co-founded SOULOVELY, creating space for QTBIPOC community and she's been packing in hundreds of people at outdoor parties ever since. LadyRyan has held long-standing residencies at some of East Bay's most popular clubs. In 2016, she was named East Bay Express’s Readers Choice as \"The Best DJ Who Dabbles in Every Scene.\"\n\nOur concerts are FREE but we require tickets\n\nTickets are released 1 month prior to the show date\n\nDidn’t get tickets on the first ticket release? Keep checking back in! We release thousands of tickets at randomly and secretly after the first release leading up to the show date. Keep trying!\n\nWe release multiple rounds (8 actually!) of tickets secretly and randomly leading up to each show because we understand that not everyone can be there at 2:00 PM. Persistence pays off. Limit 4 tickets per reservation\n\nChildren 2 years and up require a ticket\n\nOnly reserved tickets from our official Eventbrite pages. Stern Grove Festival reserves the right to refuse entry for tickets purchased from unauthorized 3rd party resellers (individuals or brokers)\n\nALL GA Tickets are made ONLINE ONLY.\n\nSIGN UP FOR UPDATES\n\nInfo on Senior, Wheelchair, & ADA Seating.\n\nADA INFO"
