        "text": "Fanatical: The Catfishing of Tegan and Sara explores the long-running catfishing scheme that targeted fans of the indie rock band.\n\nIdentical twins Tegan and Sara have a dedicated queer following, with both Tegan and Sara identifying as gay.\n\nThe documentary follows what happened when Tegan was hacked in 2011. From there, her identity was stolen and used in a complex catfish scheme to defraud the band’s fans.\n\n“Tegan and Sara ascended to global fame as one of the most influential queer indie rock bands of their generation,” the synopsis said.\n\n“They worked hard to cultivate an inclusive and passionate fanbase around the world. Listeners were drawn to the duo’s beautifully confessional lyrics, but there was more than just the music.\n\n“Fans found within the community the only safe space to come out and be queer during a time when few bands would declare allyship, let alone celebrate their own queer identity. But a bad actor took advantage of the community’s trust and comfort.”\n\n“The film is an examination of the severe ripple effect of mistrust, anxiety, and self-doubt that resulted from Fegan’s (Fake Tegan) actions,” the release continues.\n\n“Told through Tegan’s own voice, the voices of deceived fans, a trove of communications between fake Tegan and their victims, and the band’s behind-the-scenes archive, this documentary is a thriller, a caper, a whodunnit, and an intimate personal journey rolled into one.”\n\nFanatical is set to be released on October 18 in the US via Hulu. An Australia release date is yet to be announced.\n\nRead More:\n\nTegan and Sara share their story in upcoming series ‘High School’\n\nKehlani drops music video for new single ‘After Hours’\n\nTegan and Sara on queer activism: ‘Dust off and get to work’\n\nChappell Roan reflects on meteoric rise to pop stardom\n\nFor the latest LGBTIQA+ Sister Girl and Brother Boy news, entertainment, community stories in Australia, visit qnews.com.au.
