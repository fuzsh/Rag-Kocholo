        "text": "Tegan and Sara are a Canadian indie pop band formed in 1998 in Calgary, Alberta, composed of identical twin sisters Tegan Rain Quin and Sara Keirsten Quin (born September 19, 1980). Both musicians are songwriters and multi-instrumentalists.\n\nThe pair have released nine studio albums and numerous EPs. The duo earned a Grammy nomination in 2012 for their DVD/Live Album Get Along. Their ninth album, Hey, I'm Just Like You, was released on September 27, 2019. Their memoir, High School, was released on September 24, 2019.\n\nTegan and Sara began playing guitar and writing songs at age 15, forming a band called Plunk without a drummer or bass player. In 1997, they used their school's recording studio to record two demo albums: Who's in Your Band? and Play Day. In 1998, they won Calgary's \"Garage Warz\" competition, using the studio time they won to record their first professional demo under the name \"Sara and Tegan\", Yellow tape, which was followed by Orange tape and Red tape. Their first \"big-time show\" was in May 1998 in Calgary, opening for Hayden."
