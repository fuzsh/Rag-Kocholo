THEY won? Oh Goddd. I can’t believe they beat so and so.’\n\n“That always stresses me out. Sometimes it’s just better to be nominated.”\n\nSo they have been, in four categories this time around at this weekend’s Juno Awards, for the sleek-and-chic pop makeover Heartthrob. And in prestigious categories no less: single, group, songwriter and pop album of the year.\n\nThat last one particularly speaks to the esthetic transformation undertaken by the 33-year-old sisters.\n\nIn years past, they were near-exclusively nominated for alternative album of the year. They lost, on three occasions, to bands that Quin refers to as “heavy hitters” and “really cherished” — Arcade Fire (in 2008), Metric (in 2010) and Broken Social Scene (in 2006).\n\nArticle content\n\nAdvertisement 3\n\nStory continues below\n\nThis advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\n\nArticle content\n\nThe duo began, 15 years ago now, with a trio of full-lengths that peddled folk-pop occasionally imbued with gusts of emo rage.\n\nThen, beginning with 2004’s smart So Jealous, the Quins infused those torrents of punk energy with increasing degrees of melodic mastery, a trend that continued through 2007’s melancholy The Con and 2009’s punchy Sainthood.\n\nSo the twins had long proven their deft songwriting touch, but Heartthrob’s ultra-polished production — once a distinct drawback of the Quins’ catalogue — brought it into startling high definition.\n\nThe white-water whoosh Closer gave the Quins their first traditional, bona fide hit song, while piano ballad I Was a Fool — and its vertigo-inducing chorus — wasn’t far behind.\n\nAdvertisement 4\n\nStory continues below\n\nThis advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\n\nArticle content\n\nThe Quins have found high-profile, outspoken fans in the likes of Taylor Swift and Katy Perry, who will take Tegan and Sara along for an arena tour this fall. Indeed, they’ve seemingly shimmied their way into an elusive (if not always lucrative) subgenre: the pop musicians’ pop musicians.\n\nBut a chance opportunity allowed the sisters to meet an entirely new fan base, well beyond their fiercely dedicated core fans or newly appreciative taste-makers.\n\nThey were invited to record a demo of Everything is Awesome, the blithe central tune from the recently released critical gem The Lego Movie.\n\nThey weren’t used to singing other people’s songs or auditioning, both of which were necessities here. Still, they apparently aced their tryout take and, in collaboration with producer (and Devo co-founder) Mark Mothersbaugh and comedy-rap outfit the Lonely Island, recorded the chirpy hit that appears prominently in the smash film.\n\nAdvertisement 5\n\nStory continues below\n\nThis advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\n\nArticle content\n\nThe song has become a memorable element of the year’s biggest box-office hit, as well as an eerily appropriate summary of the Quins’ rising career.\n\n“When I went to see the movie, I was sitting outside the theatre and I could hear the song blasting out of the (cinema),” Quin recalled.\n\n“I was both weirdly proud and then also terribly embarrassed of being there. I was just like, oh my God, are people going to come out of the theatre and be like: ‘Oh, there’s the idiot who sang the song sitting out there. What the hell is she doing?’\n\n“It’s so awkward. But I also was like, this is amazing. This is so cool. To be sitting here laughing and listening to the song.”\n\nThe manic tune has given Tegan and Sara their highest U.S. chart placement yet, though Quin struggles to quantify its impact on their own music.\n\nAdvertisement 6\n\nStory continues below\n\nThis advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\n\nArticle content\n\n“On Google, for example, (many) people are searching ‘Tegan and Sara’ with very interesting spellings and then ‘Everything is Awesome.’ (So) there’s people searching. But does that translate into them going: ‘Oh, this band has seven records and 15 years in the industry?’ I don’t know.\n\n“I think a lot of the people who are really big into the song are under the age of 10 ... so I don’t know if they’re going: ‘I’m 8, I’m really into this music, let’s find more!’ I’m not sure if that’s how kids work these days.”\n\nThe song is, however, giving the sisters a helpful new calling card.\n\n“Four months ago, when I was trying to explain to the average person at a radio station, who are you? ‘Well, we’re the people that sing Closer.’ Now we can actually say ... ‘we sang Everything is Awesome.” And they go, ‘Oh yeah, my kids love that movie!’ So we can say our band did that and here’s our next single.”\n\nArticle content\n\nShare this article in your social network\n\nLatest National Stories"
