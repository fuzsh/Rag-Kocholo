        "text": "Canadian sister-band Tegan and Sara have announced that they’ve written a memoir. Titled High School, the twins are sharing their story of how they came to be the people and musicians they are. The memoir is due out Sept. 24, 2019, and will be published by Farrar, Straus & Giroux’s MCD division in the US. The duo explains the memoir in this statement:\n\n“How did you start your band? When did you know that you were gay? What were you like before Tegan and Sara? We have spent 20 years answering those complicated questions with simple answers. Writing High School gives us the opportunity to tell the intricate stories that shaped our relationship as sisters, musicians, and queer girls.”\n\nBelow, watch Tegan and Sara’s KEXP in-studio performance from 2012."
