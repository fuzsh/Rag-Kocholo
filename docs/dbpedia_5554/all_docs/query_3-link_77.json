        "text": "When it comes to music biopics, many entries into the genre tend to go with flashy, instantly recognizable titles: Elvis, Bohemian Rhapsody, Rocketman, the list goes on and on. But when it came to naming their memoir-turned-TV show, the Canadian indie pop duo Tegan and Sara went for a name as universal as they come: High School.\n\nIt’s fitting, then, that their new Amazon Freevee series has no interest in jumping ahead to the twin sisters’ rise to fame. We may know where the two end up, but the teenage Tegan and Sara at the heart of High School sure don’t. The eight-episode first season takes its time fleshing out the everyday minutiae of the girls’ grunge ’90s adolescence as they first explore music and partying and queerness, while wrestling with the ever-present anxiety of growing up and growing apart.\n\nTo bring young Tegan and Sara to life, High School tapped 21-year-old TikTokers Seazynn and Railey Gilliland, who Tegan first encountered via her For You Page (yes, really). While casting off of social media is a new and risky gambit, the newcomers turn in grounded yet scruffy performances befitting a show quietly engulfed in teen angst.\n\nEach of the show’s 30-minute episodes is broken into two parts with alternating points of view. High School mainly follows Tegan and Sara, yes, but it’s windows into other characters’ lives — such as their loving but spread-thin parents (Cobie Smulders and Kyle Bornheimer), or burgeoning love interests Phoebe (Olivia Rouyre) and Maya (Amanda Fix) — that give the coming-of-age series refreshing creative depth, subtly mining the ways in which the characters’ private struggles can alienate them from others, regardless of where they’re at in life. It all makes for a tender, intimate coming-of-age drama that reimagines what a biopic could (and should) be.\n\nDecider spoke to the show’s cast and creators about Tegan and Sara boot camp, TikTok casting, their hopes for Season 2, and more.\n\nOn Bringing High School From Page to Screen\n\nClea DuVall (Co- showrunner): I’ve been friends with Tegan and Sara for a very long time, and we’ve collaborated on a lot of projects together. They sent me an early copy of their book and I read it and fell in love with it, and could just so clearly see it as a television show.\n\nSo I approached them and asked them if they would let me adapt it, and luckily they said yes. [Co-showrunner Laura Kittrell and I] had a lot of conversations with them about what they felt comfortable with in terms of what from the book they did not want on the show, and what they felt comfortable with us fictionalizing. We just kept them very in the loop in terms of what roads we were going down, and how we were telling their story.\n\nSara Quin (Executive producer): Clea did such an amazing job of finding those really important moments from the memoir that helped shape us as young women, as queer people, as artists, and build out that world.\n\nIt’s really moving and beautiful. More interesting than probably what happened in our real lives. If I’m being honest, we just did a lot more drugs.\n\nOn Casting Railey and Seazynn As Young Tegan and Sara\n\nTegan Quin (Executive producer): The first [TikTok] video I remember seeing was just Railey giving a tour of her car, and she was talking about her lunch, and I just thought it was really funny. So I went and looked at her other videos and realized she was a twin. And right away, [I] was like, “Oh, my God. These twins remind me of us when we were in high school.” I sent a bunch of videos to Sara, and we kind of became obsessed.\n\nSara: I’m not just saying this because it’s a sound bite. I knew the second that we saw Railey on TikTok that she was gonna play Tegan. And then when we found Seazynn, I was like, “Seazynn is so me.” These kids are literally born to play Tegan and Sara. They’re so cool.\n\nTegan: We pushed to include Seazynn and Railey in the casting process, even though they weren’t actors or musicians. Sometimes you just have something special about you, and I think Seazynn and Railey are really watchable.\n\nSo many of the twins that auditioned were amazing, but they already felt like, “We’re actors and musicians, and we know who we are!” And there was just something about Seazynn and Railey’s audition tape. I mean, Seazynn didn’t even wanna do it! And you can feel it. It made you like her, and I think it makes their performances so compelling on screen, because they are feeling the discomfort. They are feeling the newness of the whole situation, and I think it just adds to the story.\n\nLaura Kittrell (Co-showrunner): The early [casting] conversations were a little fearful.\n\nClea: A little, like, “Are you out of your mind?”\n\nLaura: A little that. But as soon as Seazynn and Railey started taking acting classes, and they auditioned for us, and we actually saw them putting the work in and doing it, it felt like a no-brainer. I cannot imagine anyone else doing these parts.\n\nOn Seazynn and Railey’s High School Boot Camp\n\nSeazynn Gilliland (young Sara): We were going to acting class probably three, four times a week, and then having music lessons one to two times a week.\n\nRailey Gilliland (young Tegan): It was for six months total, because we took acting and music lessons while filming, but also three months prior. We moved to L.A. for three months, so we could take the classes.\n\nAnd it was a lot, coming from what I knew. I was working in a pizza shop, and I originally didn’t even want to leave my job, and I did. And I think what was most surprising was how much fun I was having in acting classes. They never pushed too much. There was an understanding there.\n\nSeazynn: I love my guitar teacher. They were great, and super helpful. Everybody that we worked with was just so understanding, and the most helpful people. So it made everything so much more fun and doable.\n\nOn the Twin Parallels\n\nTegan: This was the first time we’d really spent any time with other twins who are girls and who are close and queer. We’re like [Seazynn and Railey’s] annoying moms who are constantly bringing it up, but there are so many parallels.\n\nThey were discovered at the same age that we were, basically. And they were thrust into this adult world with expectations and pressure… way more than we had, at the same age. We signed our record deal at 20, and they signed on to play these characters at 20.\n\nSara: I was just so excited to meet other twins like us. I’ve never met another identical set of twins who were alternative and cool and grew up in a similar way. To us, they were famous. They were big on TikTok.\n\nTegan: I can remember Seazynn and Railey asking about people recognizing [them] at a supermarket and being like, “What do we say?” And I’m like, “I don’t understand! You’re on TikTok! You have millions of likes, why are you asking me this?”\n\nSara: Everything that happens in the show is really exciting to me, but when I see Seazynn and Railey on screen, I realize how new that is. I just haven’t seen twins represented on screen this way. We’re making twins cool. It’s never been that cool to be a twin, you know?\n\nOn All Those POVs\n\nClea: Because I know [Tegan and Sara], I know all the people in their world. And I know how expansive their world is. And part of what I saw in the show was just being able to [do] something Tegan and Sara couldn’t do in their memoir. Because they were writing about their experiences, they couldn’t really explore other people, but a TV show could make their world bigger.\n\nIt felt like a very exciting way to explore character and relationships in a story where all the people you’re closest to are the people who know the least about you. The audience are the only ones who really know the characters in the most intimate way.\n\nLaura: It was one of my favorite things about those first scripts that Clea wrote. When a POV shift happened, I was like, “Here we go!” It really sold me on it.\n\nClea: Their mom was a character who I was really excited to explore more, because she’s such a fascinating woman and has so much to do with who Tegan and Sara are. And then getting Cobie Smulders, she’s just unbelievable. Being able to write for her, too, was really exciting.\n\nOn Hopes for Season 2\n\nClea: I think just [exploring] their journey as musicians. I think their trajectory is just so, so layered and interesting.\n\nTegan: I think the exploration of some of the bad behavior, and the disconnect between Tegan and Sara that pulses through the book, I hope we continue to see that in the show.\n\nSara: I’m so hopeful that we get another season or two, because I think there [are] still such important moments from the memoir, if I do say so myself, that I would love to see represented on screen. Not just the stuff around romantic relationships, but I think that this dynamic between the Tegan and Sara characters, it’s so textured and complicated. And to see them become, like, local celebrities as they start to build out their career. I get really excited to imagine what that looks like on screen.\n\nTegan: I wanna know what happens next for all the characters, because there’s gonna be a fictionalized version of the story. I’m really excited to see the continuing exploration of sexuality and music. More tears!\n\nAbby Monteil is a New York-based writer.
