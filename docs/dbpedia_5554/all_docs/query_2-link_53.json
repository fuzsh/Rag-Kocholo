        "text": "The Canadian twin sisters and pop stars offered a smorgasbord of popular hits and deep cuts spanning a 20-plus-year career in their Grand Rapids tour stop Friday. Review, photos, set list.\n\nSCROLL DOWN FOR PHOTO GALLERY, SET LIST\n\nThough the peppy, Lego-ified track was absent from their tight, 90-minute set, “Everything (was indeed) Awesome” for Tegan and Sara’s Friday evening performance at Frederik Meijer Gardens & Sculpture Park.\n\nMusicians/singers/authors/activists/philanthropists Tegan Quin and Sara Quin, identical twin sisters who have performed and recorded together professionally for more than two decades, charmed the besotted crowd with a solid set of new (including “Yellow” from 2022’s “Crybaby”), old (“Walking With a Ghost”) and really, really old cuts (including an acoustic, ultra-rare performance of “My Number” from 2000’s “This Business of Art”).\n\nStarting strong with “You Wouldn’t Like Me” (from 2004’s “So Jealous”), the singers and their adept backing band delivered plenty of crowd favorites in the 20-some-odd-song roster, including “Closer,” “The Con,” “Back In Your Head,” “Boyfriend” and the show’s penultimate/encore, “Where Does the Good Go.”\n\nMixed among the songs were winsome stories and banter from the sisters, who regaled the crowd with tales of their teenage years, as well as Sara’s desire to work at a botanical garden –perhaps Meijer Gardens is hiring?\n\nFellow Canadian vocalist and longtime friend of the band Martina Sorbara (performing under the stage name Dragonette) ushered in the evening with an opening electropop performance capped off with the pop hit “Hello.”\n\nUp next at Meijer Gardens: The Wood Brothers and Shovels and Rope perform at 6:30 p.m. Sunday. The concert is sold out."
