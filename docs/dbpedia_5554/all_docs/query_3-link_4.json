        "text": "Throughout their 20+ year career, spanning ten studio albums and more than a million records sold, Tegan and Sara have used music as a medium for storytelling. With that storytelling at its core, they have built a multi-faceted media empire that extends into TV, books, newsletters, and public service, always deeply rooted in music. They added executive producer credits to their resume after the release of the coming-of-age TV series High School last fall, which was based on their critically acclaimed, New York Times best-selling memoir.\n\nWith multiple JUNO Award wins, a Governor General’s Performing Arts Award, Honorary Doctor of Laws degrees (Hon. LLD) from the University of Calgary, the 2018 New York Civil Liberties Union Award, and numerous GRAMMY, GLAAD, and Polaris Prize Award nominations, Tegan and Sara have much to be proud of, but their crowning achievement thus far is the Tegan and Sara Foundation. Next up, Tegan and Sara will receive the Humanitarian Award in recognition of their work with the LGBTQ+ community, presented at the 2024 JUNO Awards."
