        "text": "It's hard to imagine a pair of sisters more in sync than Tegan and Sara, the Canadian indie-pop duo who has been writing and performing music together for nearly 30 years. But before their Grammy nominations, world tours, and nine studio albums (and counting), the identical twins were in a desperate search to find themselves — without losing their bond to each other. Shake that up with teen angst, queer awakening, and a head-banging '90s soundtrack, and you have a sense of what their autobiographical drama series is all about. And like the best of their songs, High School is sweet and quietly devastating.\n\nTegan and Sara's memoir comes to life in High School.\n\nAdapted from Tegan Quin and Sara Quin's best-selling 2019 memoir, High School ushers audiences back to the suburbs of 1990s Calgary, where the twin sisters are entering their sophomore year as new kids on the block. Tensions are running high at home, as Sara (Seazynn Gilliland) has begun freezing Tegan (Railey Gilliland) out of hang time with their friend Phoebe, leading to a violent outburst between the sisters. At school, Sara is desperate to make friends of her own, leaving Tegan rejected and lonely…but not for long.\n\nThe sisters cross paths with a gum-spitting bully, a big-hearted tough girl, and an intoxicating squad of theater kids. They'll party, try drugs, fight, and find fragile teen love. Meanwhile, their mom (Cobie Smulders) grapples with grown-up issues, like being bored by your long-time partner, frustrated that your daughters are shutting you out, and overwhelmed by a job that's stakes are life and death.\n\nDoes High School switch perspective like Tegan and Sara's memoir?\n\nYes, but not just theirs. In the first three episodes, which premiered at the Toronto International Film Festival, simple title cards set up segments focused on Tegan, Sara, their mom Simone, and their embattled bestie Phoebe. So, for example, the first day at school is shown first from Tegan's perspective, revealing her hurt over Sara's cold shoulder in full. Then, the episode loops back to follow Sara, who carries a secret that she's so determined to protect she hasn't even shared it with her sister.\n\nDirected by Clea Duvall (Happiest Season), the first episode smartly parallels the individual sister's lonely journeys during that pivotal first day. Then, a deceptively simple wide shots reveals how close they are in aching for each other. (It's the image at the top of this page.) Unbeknownst to either, each girl winds up eating lunch alone, around the corner from one another. It's a beat that's subtly gutting, then patiently lingered on so that feeling can really sink in. Extending empathy beyond its central sisters, Simone's chapter gets a similarly harrowing moment. Its lowest point collides with and reflects another thread, where a character is forced to recognize that despite a brave face, they're not okay.\n\nMashable Top Stories\n\nStay connected with the hottest stories of the day and the latest entertainment news.\n\nSign up for Mashable's Top Stories newsletter\n\nBy signing up you agree to our Terms of Use and Privacy Policy.\n\nThanks for signing up!\n\nHigh School is not just another teen drama series.\n\nOften when it comes to teen shows, Hollywood relishes the opportunity to crank up the salacious spectacle or lean hard into the emotions. This approach can mirror the intensity of teendom, with all those damned hormones colliding with a sense of powerlessness and a reckless belief in your own invincibility. But rather than playing all these feelings at 11, this musician focuses show strums softly, grounding the everyday dramas of these girls — even those that involve sex and drugs — in a humbly authentic portrayal.\n\nTikTok stars Railey and Seazynn Gilliland shed their big smiles and boundless confidence to fully inhabit the characters of these shy twin sisters, who seem so uncomfortable in their skin that you might well feel the itch. Though soft-spoken, their words can still sting as they clamor into the casual cruelty of youth. But whether it's insults or punches that are thrown, these two will always find each other again. The push of their needs to find their individuality and the pull of their deeply rooted sisterhood thrums at the core of the series.\n\nTegan and Sara give us that rad '90s nostalgia.\n\nYou won't hear much of their music for the intro episodes. Instead, Duvall — a '90s icon in her own right — envelops us in the era with music from The Smashing Pumpkins, Violent Femmes, Weezer, and Green Day. The familiar songs play at parties and concerts and during make-out sessions, a soundtrack that is tantamount to time travel. Mindful costuming hammers the vibe home with dead-on details, like oversized long-sleeved tees, a preference for plaid, and those hefty wallet chains. Then there are the girls' necklaces, one a simple colorfully beaded affair, the other a polymer yin yang on a string. Not only accurate to the period, this jewelry also helps audiences identify at a glance which identical twin is which. It's a clever move for easy clarity.\n\nI must admit, I kept waiting for High School to ramp up to the frenzied pace that so many teen dramas favor. I yearned for the adrenaline, but that was just me shackling the show with a dubious standard. Once I let go of that arguably unfair expectation, I enjoyed this Freevee series for what it is: a tender and enchanting exploration of sisterhood, queerness, music, and growing up.\n\nHigh School made its world premiere at the 2022 Toronto International Film Festival in the Prime Time slate. Then, the first four episodes will land on Amazon Freevee Oct. 14, with new episodes every Friday."
