        "text": "After yesterday’s announcement about electronic sibling duo Disclosure’s first gig in Hong Kong, we’ve got more news of a family act coming to our shores this summer. Identical twin sisters Tegan and Sara Quin of the eponymous band Tegan and Sara will be making their return to Hong Kong in July after the release of their upcoming album, and we are so excited.\n\nThe Quin twins have been making music (and being kick-ass LGBTQ icons) since the late 1990s, but recent years have seen them enjoying the commercial success they deserve, making the transition from indie darlings (twin-die darlings?) to fully fledged, chart-topping stars – though with their trademark honest, emotive lyrics and vocal harmonies intact, thankfully.\n\nFollowing six albums which veered from indie folk (Under Feet Like Ours, This Business of Art, If It Was You), to a darker, more biting indie rock sound (So Jealous, The Con, Sainthood), the Quins made a huge departure from “what people expect from Tegan and Sara” with their shimmering 2012 album Heartthrob.\n\nTo date, the synthpoppy, triumphant record is the band’s highest-charting record, reaching number one in US rock and alternative charts and earning them a place on that year’s Polaris Music Prize shortlist. It spawned catchy, dance-y earworms like Closer, on which the twins croon, “Here comes the heat before we meet a little bit closer/Here comes the spark before the dark, come a little closer”.\n\nContinuing on their world domination mainstream success, the Quins collaborated on The Lego Movie‘s theme song, Everything is Awesome with The Lonely Island in 2014. Yeah, you know you’ve had it stuck in your head at least a dozen times.\n\nSince then, Tegan and Sara have been working on their upcoming album, Love You To Death, which is due to be released on June 3. That gives you plenty of time to memorise all of the lyrics before their concert. You can bet that we’ll be doing that.\n\nWhile they may be considered veterans in the ever-changing music scene, Tegan and Sara’s music has never once come off as tired (at least to us), with the core of their charm never changing. Aside from the aforementioned lyrical and vocal appeal, the Quins have made a name for themselves over the years as truly engaging and witty performers, often regaling their adoring audience with stories from the road and their childhood. Can you tell that we love them?\n\nTickets go on sale at 10am on Wednesday, April 27 on HK Ticketing. We’ll see you at KITEC in July, standing right and the front and possibly crying (depending on the set list).\n\nWhat: Tegan and Sara live in Hong Kong\n\nWhen: Sunday 28 July, 2016\n\nWhere: KITEC\n\nPrice: HKD588, all standing tickets\n\nTickets: Here\n\nGot a tip? Send it to us at hongkong@coconuts.co"
