        "text": "Title: Tegan and Sara: Junior High\n\nAuthor: Tegan and Sara Quin\n\nPublisher: Macmillan Children’s Publishing\n\nPublication date: May 30, 2023\n\nAmazon | Barnes and Noble | Bookshop.org | Goodreads | StoryGraph\n\nSummary\n\nBefore becoming the popular band Tegan and Sara, the Quins were just two twins trying to find their place in the world. Moving to a new school in junior high definitely doesn’t help with that. Originally, junior high was something that the two sisters were going to face together. After all, that’s how they’ve always done life. Together. They’re not quite sure who they are without the other one, after all.\n\nHowever, sometimes growing up means growing apart. When Tegan and Sara start making different friends, they realize that maybe they don’t have to be together all the time. And maybe they can figure out who they are without the other. But their discovery of music might just be what brings them together again.\n\nReview: Tegan and Sara: Junior High\n\nThanks to NetGalley and Macmillan Children’s for an advanced copy of Tegan and Sara: Junior High Ilby Tegan and Sara Quin to review! Illustrated by Tillie Walden, I knew I had to pick this one up. Tillie Walden is one of my favorite graphic novel creators. Love some queer middle grade graphic novels, too!\n\nThe art: phenomenal. Of course, we wouldn’t expect anything less from Walden. I just love her art style, and this one incorporates what looks like watercolor. The layouts and the illustrations lend themselves well to this particular story, and the use of color for the different sisters helps show who is speaking.\n\nHowever, the writing felt a little all over the place to me. Some of the storylines were a bit difficult to follow, and some of the pages felt a little to wordy. The themes hit on classic middle school themes, with the added context of them being twins. I was also confused as to why they decided to change the story to present day? The story might have worked better if they would have kept it set in the 90s. Kids would still dig that! The 90s are in, apparently. I think it would have helped make the writing feel less like it was all over the place.\n\nAll in all, loved this for the illustrations, just wish the writing would have been a little tighter.\n\n3.5/5 stars"
