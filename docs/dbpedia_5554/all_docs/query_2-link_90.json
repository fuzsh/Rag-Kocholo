        "text": "Tegan and Sara started making music when they were just 15 years old. That means they spent a lot of their formative, growing-up years as musicians, writing and working together. A few years ago, they explored those early days in a memoir they wrote together, called High School, and last year, they turned that memoir into a TV show of the same name. They also released their first album of all-new music since 2016, called Crybaby, that sees them dealing with big life changes and continuing to “grow up” together as sisters and artists."
