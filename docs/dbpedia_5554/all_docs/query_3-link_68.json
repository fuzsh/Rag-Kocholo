She is portrayed by Railey Gilliland.\n\nBiography[]\n\nTegan is a reserved, observant, and sensitive 15-year-old who, for the first time, starts to access her own self-confidence through playing music. In the beginning of the series, Tegan and her sister Sara are drifting apart but Tegan doesn't understand why. They both go to a new high school but Tegan struggles at first. She gets bullied and is shy. However, she befriends a girl at school named Maya. They start to hang out often.\n\nTegan and Sara start to make up but there is still a distance between them. They stay in between their mom, Simone's house, and their dad David's house.\n\nTegan and Maya's friendship continues to grow, but one day Tegan and Sara discover a guitar in the house. They start to teach themselves guitar and to write songs together. Maya gets jealous that Tegan is forgetting about her to hang out with Sara. She accuses her of keeping Maya as a \"filler friend\", but Tegan insists this isn't the case. Maya starts to avoid Tegan but Tegan continues to call Maya and leave her notes.\n\nTegan and Sara get invited to play at a party. They're thrilled because it's their first show ever. They work to save up to buy a new guitar to play at the show. Their mom helps them with the money, with the promise that they pay her back.\n\nTegan and Sara go to play the show. Tegan asks Maya to come, which she does, but she sees Cass and Tegan hugging which upsets her. Cass is supportive of Tegan, giving her a good luck necklace. Tegan tells Sara what's going on with Phoebe (that she has a French summer program and won't be around this summer), which frustrates Sara. Sara leaves Tegan alone at the show.\n\nGallery[]"
