        "text": "11/17: Interview- Tegan and Sara embrace power of pop\n\nTegan Quin and her twin sister, Sara, were more than a decade into carving out a niche as well-respected indie darlings by the time the Canadian duo started working on the seventh album that became their mainstream breakthrough, last year's \"Heartthrob.\"\n\nBut the thought of \"going pop\" did not require many dark nights of the soul for either one.\n\nAs Tegan says, they'd grown up in the '80s, after all.\n\n\"We grew up listening to pop before it was a dirty word,\" she says. \"And I always kind of felt like we were writing pop songs. We weren't producing them that way. But I like the way it feels to put out a big-sounding record. And as an alternative artist and a gay artist, I like the idea of messing up the mainstream. I like the idea of diversifying. There's not a lot like us ... actually there's nothing like us on pop radio. So the idea of getting Tegan and Sara slammed between Beyonce and Calvin Harris felt really exciting. It felt like a challenge.\"\n\nWhich they definitely rose to, hitting Billboard's album chart at No. 3 with \"Heartthrob\" while topping the dance charts with \"Closer,\" a synth-pop breakthough hit that also went Top 40 on Billboard's alternative-songs and rock-songs charts.\n\nTegan is enjoying the life of a crossover artist.\n\n\"Looking back on the past few years,\" she says, \"some of my favorite memories are of standing on stage with Taylor Swift or opening for Katy Perry or doing that whole summer tour with Fun. These are opportunities I never thought we'd have. And although we may not have been able to articulate this three years ago, we are saying the same thing we were thinking at the time, which is that our band should be able to reach more people without compromising the quality of the music.\"\n\nThe sound with which they accomplished that was heavily inspired by the music they grew up on in the '80s and early '90s.\n\n\"We grew up listening to everything from Pet Shop Boys and Depeche Mode to Kate Bush, Bruce Springsteen, U2, Cyndi Lauper,\" Tegan says. \"And Calgary was kind of divided between punk rock, hip-hop and dance music, so we would go to a punk show on Friday night and then a rave on Saturday. So we've had the whole spectrum of music influence us over the years. And I think there's a little bit of everything in there. But specifically, I think we were really just thinking more about songwriting, like 'She's So Unusual' by Cyndi Lauper.\"\n\nThe drift into poppier waters was Tegan's idea, not Sara's.\n\n\"I've always been more interested in being more commercial,\" Tegan says. \"A lot of big bands over the years have really liked us and I've always been into that â€” like, 'Let's go on tour with the Killers. And Paramore wants to do a tour. Let's do it!' And Sara's always been more reluctant, like she feels we're more, you know, outsiders and alternative. And it's funny because I think she writes such poppy songs.\"\n\nOnce the sisters started working on it, though, Sara's reluctance to embrace her pop side quickly faded.\n\n\"Initially,\" Tegan says, \"it was me saying, 'I don't want to make another obscure indie-rock record. I don't care about the Pitchforks of the world saying, 'Yeah, you've made a really weird, random record that nobody likes.' I was like, 'OK, I want to pay off my mortgage before 2080. I want to play huge shows. I want to go to Coachella and headline. I wanted to be a bigger band. I wanted to change the face of pop music. I want to diversify the mainstream.\n\n\"Then, we got into the studio and I was like, 'I don't know. Maybe we don't have to push it that far.' And Sara was like, 'Push, push, push. Keep going. Sing bigger. Sing better. This is obscure. What are you saying? Talk to the regular people. Talk to me.' We really coached each other and I think we found a place that was comfortable for both of us. But I think Sara realized there was power in being able to reach more people.\"\n\nThe Quins are playing Phoenix on Monday on the final round of touring in support of \"Heartthrob,\" after which they plan to take 2015 off to work on new material.\n\nAs to what that new material might sound like, Tegan says, \"The truth is that we've learned over the course of seven records that the songs sort of dictate the direction. But I think we're definitely still really interested in pop music and trying to make records that sound really different than the ones before. So I think it's pretty safe to put your money on another Tegan and Sara pop record. It'll be different than \"Heartthrob.\" But if people are holding out that they're gonna get a folk-rock or indie-rock record out of us, that's not gonna happen.\"\n\nTegan laughs, then adds, \"So start preparing.\""
