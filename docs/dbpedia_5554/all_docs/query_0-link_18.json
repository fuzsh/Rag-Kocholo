        "text": "Tegan and Sara () are a Canadian indie pop duo formed in 1998 in Calgary, Alberta, composed of identical twin sisters Tegan Rain Quin and Sara Keirsten Quin (born September 19, 1980). Both musicians are songwriters and multi-instrumentalists.\n\nThe pair have released nine studio albums. They earned a Grammy nomination in 2012 for their DVD/live album Get Along. Their tenth album, Crybaby, will be released on October 21, 2022. Their memoir, High School, was released on September 24, 2019. The TV show High School based on the memoir was released on Amazon Freevee in the fall of 2022.\n\nTegan and Sara began playing guitar and writing songs at age 15, using an old guitar they found in their basement owned by their then-stepfather, Bruce. One of the first songs they wrote was Tegan Didn't Go To School Today, originally written by Sara. They later sang and recorded the song together on a cassette tape. They first called their band Plunk, defined as 'light punk' as they had neither a drummer nor bass player at the time. In 1997, they used their school's recording studio to record two demo albums: Who's in Your Band? and Play Day. In 1998, they won Calgary's \"Garage Warz\" competition; using the studio time they won in this competition, they recorded their first professional demo under the name \"Sara and Tegan\", Yellow tape. This was followed by Orange tape and Red tape. Their first \"big-time show\" was in May 1998 in Calgary, opening for Hayden."
