        "text": "The high and lows of preteens navigating school and life, inspired by the Quin sibling pop duo’s actual childhoods.\n\nIdentical twin sisters Tegan and Sara have moved and are entering a new junior high in Calgary where they’ll be in different classes, making everything even more intimidating. They navigate a slew of awkward, messy moments—making new friends and keeping faraway ones, getting their first bras and first periods, crushing on cute classmates, trying to be cool but still appreciating dorky parents, and living separate lives while trying to remain close to each other. Eventually they find their stepfather’s guitar in the garage, and making music together not only mends some rifts in their relationship, but begins a meaningful, far-reaching creative journey. The setting has been updated for modern audiences and includes cellphones and Taylor Swift references. The narrative switches between depictions of the characters going through real life (drawn in purple tones) and interludes in which the twins, color-coded with light blue for Tegan and pale maroon for Sara, share their innermost thoughts, feelings, and reflections with readers. The story is sweet, focusing on the all-important relationships of tween life. Walden’s illustrations are, as usual, wonderfully expressive. They transition smoothly from busier scenes to quieter ones along the story’s emotional beats. The White twins’ circle of friends includes queer kids and people of color.\n\nTugs at the heartstrings like a well-tuned guitar. (authors’ note) (Graphic fiction. 9-13)\n\nSandy and his family, Japanese Canadians, experience hatred and incarceration during World War II.\n\nSandy Saito loves baseball, and the Vancouver Asahi ballplayers are his heroes. But when they lose in the 1941 semifinals, Sandy’s dad calls it a bad omen. Sure enough, in December 1941, Japan bombs Pearl Harbor in the U.S. The Canadian government begins to ban Japanese people from certain areas, moving them to “dormitories” and setting a curfew. Sandy wants to spend time with his father, but as a doctor, his dad is busy, often sneaking out past curfew to work. One night Papa is taken to “where he [is] needed most,” and the family is forced into an internment camp. Life at the camp isn’t easy, and even with some of the Asahi players playing ball there, it just isn’t the same. Trying to understand and find joy again, Sandy struggles with his new reality and relationship with his father. Based on the true experiences of Japanese Canadians and the Vancouver Asahi team, this graphic novel is a glimpse of how their lives were affected by WWII. The end is a bit abrupt, but it’s still an inspiring and sweet look at how baseball helped them through hardship. The illustrations are all in a sepia tone, giving it an antique look and conveying the emotions and struggles. None of the illustrations of their experiences are overly graphic, making it a good introduction to this upsetting topic for middle-grade readers.\n\nAn emotional, much-needed historical graphic novel. (afterword, further resources) (Graphic historical fiction. 9-12)\n\nAn aspiring scientist and a budding artist become friends and help each other with dream projects.\n\nUnfolding in mid-1980s Sacramento, California, this story stars 12-year-olds Rosalind and Benjamin as first-person narrators in alternating chapters. Ro’s father, a fellow space buff, was killed by a drunk driver; the rocket they were working on together lies unfinished in her closet. As for Benji, not only has his best friend, Amir, moved away, but the comic book holding the clue for locating his dad is also missing. Along with their profound personal losses, the protagonists share a fixation with the universe’s intriguing potential: Ro decides to complete the rocket and hopes to launch mementos of her father into outer space while Benji’s conviction that aliens and UFOs are real compels his imagination and creativity as an artist. An accident in science class triggers a chain of events forcing Benji and Ro, who is new to the school, to interact and unintentionally learn each other’s secrets. They resolve to find Benji’s dad—a famous comic-book artist—and partner to finish Ro’s rocket for the science fair. Together, they overcome technical, scheduling, and geographical challenges. Readers will be drawn in by amusing and fantastical elements in the comic book theme, high emotional stakes that arouse sympathy, and well-drawn character development as the protagonists navigate life lessons around grief, patience, self-advocacy, and standing up for others. Ro is biracial (Chinese/White); Benji is White.\n\nCharming, poignant, and thoughtfully woven. (Fiction. 9-12)"
