        "text": "Family matters, especially for these siblings who literally have music in their DNA. It’s easy to get the band together when you share the same roof and sometimes, it’s even more fun. From Hanson to the Beach Boys to the Jackson 5, families with more than one talented offspring seems to be a common thing. Here are 15 musical siblings and their best collaborations.\n\n1. Hilary and Haylie Duff – “Our Lips Are Sealed”\n\nThe Duff sisters are double threats. Not only did they collaborate on this cover of The Go-Go’s “Our Lips Are Sealed” but they also starred together in 2006’s Material Girls.\n\n2. The Jonas Brothers – “Year 3000”\n\nWhile the brothers known as Jonas continue to gain success with their solo musical ventures, it’s hard to argue that they were at their best when they were all together.\n\n3. Joel and Benji Madden – “Lifestyles of the Rich and the Famous”\n\nJoel and Benji Madden have been in it together for the long haul. Starting with their band Good Charlotte and then later as a duo, The Madden Brothers have relish in their lifestyle of the rich and famous side by side.\n\n4. Chloe and Halle – “Drop”\n\nProteges of Beyoncé, Chloe and Halle started as YouTube sensations before receiving the official stamp of approval from Queen Bey. From a cameo appearance in Lemonade to the release of their EPs Sugar Symphony and The Two of Us, the sisters are well on their way to an empire of their own.\n\n5. Jaden and Willow Smith – “Find You Somewhere”\n\nJaden and Willow Smith have come out of the shadows of their famous parents into their own right. From their style and viral tweets, the brother and sister continue standing out from the rest of the crowd.\n\n6. Miley and Noah Cyrus\n\nSo these two haven’t technically collaborated just yet but with Miley’s upcoming album Younger Now and Noah’s star fastly on the rise, we’re keeping out fingers crossed.\n\n7. Solange and Beyoncé Knowles – “Naive”\n\nSisters that slay together, stay together. Time and time again Beyoncé and Solange have had each other’s backs but they’ve only collaborated on “Naive” — unless you count the iconic The Proud Family theme song.\n\n8. Ashlee and Jessica Simpson – “Little Drummer Boy”\n\n9. Britney and Jamie Lynn Spears – “Chillin’ with You”\n\nBritney and Jamie Lynn have been through a lot but have stuck with each other through it all. Here’s their only collaboration (so far) off of Britney’s 2003 album, Britney Jean.\n\n10. Aaron and Nick Carter – “Oh Aaron”\n\nThough things might be a bit rock for the Carter brothers now, there was a time where Nick and Aaron were inseparable. “Oh Aaron” was just one of their collaborations where Aaron plays the role of the little brother asking for his big bro for the ultimate favor.\n\n11. Tegan and Sara – “Closer”\n\nNot only are Tegan and Sara siblings, they’re also TWINS. One of the most prolific LGBT advocates in the music business for the last decade, the sisters are still cranking out hit after hit after hit.\n\n12. HAIM – “Want You Back”\n\nThe HAIM sisters have made quite the splash in such a short amount of time. Their latest release, Something To Tell You, debuted at No. 7 on the Billboard 200 chart, peaking at No. 3.\n\n13. Noal and Liam Gallagher – “Don’t Look Back in Anger”\n\nAnother brother duo that just can’t seem to get along but hey, the music they made with Oasis is still great and their Twitter spats are extremely entertaining.\n\n14. Chance the Rapper and Taylor Bennett – “Broad Shoulders”\n\nChance the Rapper may be the more famous brother but Taylor Bennett is proving that talent runs in the family. With a couple tracks under their belt, we’re hoping for a Chance and Taylor mixtape to pop up sometime soon.\n\n15. The Jackson 5 – “ABC”\n\nArguably, the most famous siblings of them all, it was hard to pick the “best” Jackson 5 song because the list is literally endless."
