        "text": "Tegan and Sara's journey has been shaped by many special moments in their career. From a Grammy nomination to a memoir, a TV show based on their lives, and ten albums, it's been one of the wildest rides. And now they're opening up about a special moment that has become not only special to them but also to fans all around the world.\n\nCosmopolitan has an exclusive first look at the next season of Audible's Words + Music series where some of the biggest names have opened up about their careers and lives. This time it's Tegan and Sara's turn in Under My Control and in a very special clip, they talk about how Grey's Anatomy completely changed their career and brought them to new audiences.\n\n\"We joke that Tegan and Sara wouldn't be Tegan and Sara without Grey's Anatomy, because the use of so much of our music helped us,\" they reveal on the Audible Original.\n\nThey also reveal that wrote Shonda Rhimes, the creator of Grey's Anatomy, a letter on the 10th anniversary of the album for including \"Where Does the Good Go\" during Meredith and Cristina's \"dance it out\" moments in the show along with another big track.\n\nThroughout the episode the two sisters and musicians will, \"recount their unique navigation through sisterhood and the music industry. Once twin sisters fighting over their shared guitar in rural Canada, now chart-topping, award-winning indie rock icons, they reflect on the highs and lows of their relationship and their career. As musicians, they held themselves to the highest standard possible, always looking for ways to control their narrative, their music, and their experience. As sisters, they pushed each other, literally and figuratively, along their remarkable path to success. Featuring eight new recordings from their decade-spanning catalogue—including “Closer,” “Where Does the Good Go,” “Walking with a Ghost,” and “Back in Your Head” — Under My Control is an unvarnished and vulnerable examination of their experiences and the intricacies of their relationship.\""
