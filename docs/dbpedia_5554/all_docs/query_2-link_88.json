        "text": "Tegan and Sara are getting older; their fans aren’t\n\nWhen Tegan and Sara look out from the stage and into the audience, they see themselves.\n\nThey see fans like them singing along with their songs — folks who like the same clothes, same hair. They see their people. Only Tegan and Sara are less like their people these days, Tegan said in a recent interview. “As we’ve grown up, our audience has gotten younger,” she said. “We’ve crisscrossed from one side to the other” of the fan age spectrum.\n\nTegan and Sara may be getting older, but they’re still writing outstanding music, like “Closer,” the hit single on their new album “Heartthrob.” They used a line from the single to name the tour they’re bringing toTthe Orange Peel on May 20. The Let’s Make Things Physical tour calls for a lot of dancing, Tegan said.\n\n“We wanted to be more flexible on stage, move around a bit more. ‘Heartthrob’ is such an upbeat record, and it’s taken (the performances) to a new level,” she said. “It’s nice to look into the faces of people that come to the shows and see how much they’re attached to the songs.”\n\nSongs like “Goodbye, Goodbye” and “Walking With a Ghost” get everyone singing. Songs like these become anthems for people of a certain age, the age they were when they were first exposed to the twin sisters from Canada. Tegan and Sara seemed to be singing their soundtrack, something a lot of people noticed. The duo has sold nearly 1 million albums, producing one about every two years.\n\nTegan and Sara Quin were born in Calgary, Alberta, in 1980, and started their musical careers at 15, writing music and playing guitar. Neil Young’s manager Elliot Roberts heard them and signed them to his Los Angeles-based label. The album “If It Was You” in 2002 launched their careers internationally. (Having six songs on “Grey’s Anatomy” didn’t hurt either.) In March, Tegan and Sara hit the trifecta, winning three Juno Awards (like a Grammy, only Canadian) for song (“Closer”), album (“Heartthrob”) and group of the year.\n\n“We really let ourselves go crazy in the studio,” Tegan said of the album. “We felt it was time to freshen up our sound. If you don’t shake things up and create momentum, you start to stagnate. We didn’t want to be a band that plays it safe. We took risks with ‘Heartthrob.’”\n\nHaving a sister, much less a twin, has an advantage when it comes to songwriting. They can rely on each other for different kinds of lyrics (Sara’s lyrics are more image based, and Tegan’s are more feelings based, she said). They write and send their work to each other, swapping versions from their homes in New York City and Montreal (Sara) and Los Angeles and Vancouver (Tegan).\n\n“It’s working for us so far,” she said. Being sisters, working on the road together over thousands of gigs in the last 15 years, has made them better performers. “We’ve learned what works for our audience and what doesn’t,” she said. “We’re interested in making sure each song has heart and soul, but we don’t want to make music for ourselves. I want us to make music that people will enjoy, that we’ll all enjoy. As we’ve grown up, our songs have grown up as well.”\n\nTegan and Sara aren’t the ingénues they were when they started out at 17, opening eventually for Neil Young, Ben Folds and Ryan Adams. “I hardly go out to live shows anymore,” Tegan said. She’s of the age where she likes listening to music at home and is floored that their fans, many born a decade after her and her sister, want to befriend them. She’s appreciative and humbled. But she’s amazed. “I’m like I’m so old, but I’m not,” she said.\n\nIt’s great to be in this big adventure with Sara, Tegan said. “Through good and bad times, there’s been only us,” she said. “It keeps us motivated, passionate and focused. We definitely lucked out having each other as partners in the band.”\n\nPaul Clark covers entertainment for Scene.
