Since then, the two have toured extensively with many artists, including Neil Young, Rufus Wainwright, The Pretenders, Ben Folds, The Killers, Rachael Cantu, Vivek Shraya, Cake, Gogol Bordello, Hot Hot Heat, Ryan Adams, Veda Hille, Little Birdy, Iron On, Little Brazil, Bryan Adams, Paramore and Weezer and on Sarah McLachlan's Lilith Fair. They are signed to Neil Young's Vapor Records in the U.S. and to the Universal Music Group in Canada. The twins currently live in Victoria, British Columbia.Originally, as when they were competing in Garage Warz, the duo was known as \"Sara and Tegan\". It just so happened that they didn't submit their own application to Garage Warz; someone else did, and reversed the names on the application. Their first album, Under Feet Like Ours, was initially released under the name \"Sara and Tegan\"; copies are now a sought-after commodity among their fans.The twins tell comic stories on stage, a throwback to when they didn't have a lot of material but still wanted to give people a full show.While both twins are similarly involved in vocals and playing instruments, the singing of the lead melody often goes to whichever twin wrote the particular song. Sara has been quoted saying that Tegan writes songs prolifically, \"like a fish lays eggs,\" eventually discarding most of them. Sara's songs, on the other hand, evolve slowly and methodically and almost always make it onto the record. As of 2022, Tegan and Sara have released eleven full-length studio albums, the most recent being Crybaby, released this year past October. Â« hide"
