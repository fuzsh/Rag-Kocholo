So they looked to their past.\n\nThe result was their New York Times-bestselling memoir High School. The book has just been released in paperback and will likely be the centre of the conversation when the Quin sisters take part in the Vancouver Writers Festival Zoom event on Oct. 23 at 8 p.m.\n\nAdvertisement 2\n\nStory continues below\n\nThis advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\n\nTHIS CONTENT IS RESERVED FOR SUBSCRIBERS ONLY\n\nSubscribe now to read the latest news in your city and across Canada.\n\nUnlimited online access to articles from across Canada with one account.\n\nGet exclusive access to the Vancouver Sun ePaper, an electronic replica of the print edition that you can share, download and comment on.\n\nEnjoy insights and behind-the-scenes analysis from our award-winning journalists.\n\nSupport local journalists and the next generation of journalists.\n\nDaily puzzles including the New York Times Crossword.\n\nSUBSCRIBE TO UNLOCK MORE ARTICLES\n\nSubscribe now to read the latest news in your city and across Canada.\n\nUnlimited online access to articles from across Canada with one account.\n\nGet exclusive access to the Vancouver Sun ePaper, an electronic replica of the print edition that you can share, download and comment on.\n\nEnjoy insights and behind-the-scenes analysis from our award-winning journalists.\n\nSupport local journalists and the next generation of journalists.\n\nDaily puzzles including the New York Times Crossword.\n\nREGISTER / SIGN IN TO UNLOCK MORE ARTICLES\n\nCreate an account or sign in to continue with your reading experience.\n\nAccess articles from across Canada with one account.\n\nShare your thoughts and join the conversation in the comments.\n\nEnjoy additional articles per month.\n\nGet email updates from your favourite authors.\n\nSign In or Create an Account\n\nEmail Address\n\nor\n\nArticle content\n\n“We had come off the road after back-to-back records in 2018. We were looking for a creative path and maybe one that wasn’t musical initially,” said Tegan over the phone from her Vancouver home. “When we sold the proposal and sat down to write I was definitely a little regretful, a little bit. Well, maybe not regretful, but definitely terrified.”\n\nThat trepidation was tempered a bit by the knowledge that she and Sara, who lives in North Vancouver, had excelled in English in high school and had both enjoyed writing.\n\nIn High School, the Quin sisters write from their adolescent point of view. The book, now out in paperback, is broken down by grades with the sisters writing alternating chapters.\n\n“We did spend a lot of time together,” said Tegan of growing up. “Our memories are really tangled up. I think that was a really fun part of writing the book — was to untangle some of the memories, to get the facts straight, but also our editors really encouraged us to write our own version of the story. It was OK if some of the details didn’t line up.”\n\nIt’s worth noting that Deadline recently reported the memoir is being adapted into a TV series by heavyweight Plan B Entertainment, and Amazon’s free streaming service IMDb TV. The pilot will be directed and written by Clea DuVall and the Quin sisters will have executive producing credits on the project.\n\nArticle content\n\nAdvertisement 3\n\nStory continues below\n\nThis advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\n\nArticle content\n\nProducts of the grunge and rave-era 1990s, the sisters’ story of those school years in Calgary will be, for many, very relatable. Crushes, broken hearts, best friends, trying drugs and alcohol, minor victories, big mistakes and fighting with your sister over the phone are quintessential teenage traditions. High School, the book, will make you remember high school years — good and bad.\n\nAs the girls move through high school you see the musical seeds of what is now a hugely successful pop career get planted. You also see the now LGTBQ+ icons trying to figure out their sexual identities.\n\n“It was a significant time. We just didn’t figure out we were queer but we figured out we were creative — that we were artists. That we were going to be musicians,” said Tegan. “I think a lot of people do that in college or after high school, but we figured out a lot while we were still young. I think for us to go back and have the opportunity to tell that origin story in our own words was super important to us. Also, that time exists in a weird capsule because it’s not on the Internet.”\n\nTegan said the pair turned to a group of their still close high school friends to help with memories, photos and journal entries.\n\nA lot of those memories aren’t perfect little stories with perfect little endings. It’s the warts-and-all approach that makes this story interesting — and more importantly honest.\n\n“I think there is a lot of pressure on public figures to only give the positive parts of their lives. A lot of our early life wasn’t positive. We moved around a lot. Our parents got divorced. My mom had to work evenings. We experimented with drugs and alcohol. We were dishonest,” said Tegan. “We were struggling with our identities. We were both homophobic and internalized homophobia really shaped a lot of our adolescence and these are the stories that people don’t necessarily want to present.”\n\nAdvertisement 4\n\nStory continues below\n\nThis advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\n\nArticle content\n\nWe apologize, but this video has failed to load.\n\nTry refreshing your browser, or\n\ntap here to see other videos from our team.\n\nStories like Sara peer pressuring a reluctant Tegan into trying acid (LSD) when the pair were in Grade 10.\n\n“ ‘You have to try it,’ I told Tegan dozens of times over the summer, but she remained adamant that she had no interest, retelling our mom’s story about a friend who had done the drug only once and had a schizophrenic break,” Sara writes in the book. “I wouldn’t let up, and when Tegan finally gave in, we agreed that I would stay sober to ensure nothing went wrong while she took her first hit.”\n\nNothing went wrong, unless of course you count an hours-long explanation of the plot of the movie The Clan of the Cave Bear that Tegan delivered while high and stretched out on the carpet.\n\n“We told the story honestly about our drug use because it was a device,” said Tegan. “It was a device to say we had a choice and we chose music. We chose art. We chose to create. We chose to be passionate about something and it kind of corrected our course.”\n\nThat course sent them on a musical journey that began in Grade 10 with the discovery of their stepdad’s guitar. Tegan and Sara taught themselves to play by watching videos on MuchMusic and started putting their thoughts and feelings down on paper. Something clicked and after playing for friends in basements, playing for small coffee-shop audiences and winning a radio station contest, the sisters got a record deal that went nowhere, forcing them to adopt a DIY approach.\n\nAdvertisement 5\n\nStory continues below\n\nThis advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\n\nArticle content\n\nThey convinced their grandfather to lend them $10,000 to rent a Pro Tools rig to record an album that they could then sell themselves at their gigs.\n\n“We convinced Grampa to lend us the money to make the record, after we passionately explained, while mom and Gramma looked on, we weren’t just going to be artists; we were going to be business owners,” Tegan explains in the book’s epilogue.\n\nNow age 40, they are very much a successful business. They have made nine studio albums and have sold more than two million pre-streaming records. They have three Juno Awards, Governor General’s Performing Arts Award and have been nominated for a Grammy. Their Tegan and Sara Foundation has spent the last four years fighting for health, economic justice and representation for LGBTQ+ girls and women.\n\nLike musicians everywhere the twins have been grounded during these COVID-19 times but, as Tegan explains, they are not feeling the pinch of not touring as much as other acts as they had planned to spend most of this year at home working on other projects.\n\nAside from their memoir, the sisters just released a dance EP called Hey, We’re Just Like You and are finishing up working on a pair of graphic novels that star a fictionalized junior high-aged Tegan and Sara. They also sold a book and a 10-episode podcast about being twins. All those projects should be here in early 2022.\n\nAdvertisement 6\n\nStory continues below\n\nThis advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\n\nArticle content\n\n“We’re able to pivot,” said Tegan, using that oh-so COVID term.\n\nAs for another memoir, Tegan said they will at one point dig into their career as a topic but right now they are busy enough.\n\nBut not too busy to answer the classic question: What advice would you give to your teen self?\n\n“I’d give the same advice to my young self as I’d give to myself now, which is you have to be compassionate and empathetic to yourself, too. I think we are all way too hard on ourselves,” said Tegan. “I think I felt a lot of pressure as a young person and I think I feel it now, too. It is a daily practice of lightening up a bit, just enjoying the ride, I think for all young people, I would say. It’s hard for everybody.”\n\nAs mentioned earlier, Tegan and Sara will be doing an event for the Vancouver Writers Festival. This year’s festival is online and running until Oct. 25. Alongside the Quin sisters, other authors of note that still have events coming up are Pulitzer Prize-winner Marilynne Robinson, Giller Prize-winner Ian Williams and other prominent literary figures like Ian Rankin, Thomas King, Kevin Kwan and Emma Donoghue.\n\ndgee@postmedia.com\n\ntwitter.com/dana_gee\n\nRecommended from Editorial\n\nTegan and Sara sell face masks to benefit Pivot Legal Society, Hogan's Alley Society\n\nTegan and Sara announce new high school-inspired album out this fall\n\nWe've got you covered on the Vancouver music scene\n\nRead more about books and authors\n\nCLICK HERE to report a typo.\n\nIs there more to this story?
