        "text": "Above is the home of Adolph Maillard, at Castle Rock that is near Woodacre. Adolph sold his property to the Lagunitas Development Company who sold eight ajoining tracts of land to August D. Stuttmeister the daughter of Carl Janke who founded a Theme Park in Belmont California, modeled after a German Beirgarten. I suspect Augustus moved the Jankes and Stuttmeisters from Laurel Hill cemetary to the beautiful family crypt in Coma. You see her name behind my daughter and newborn grandson, Tyler Hunt. Did she have plans to build another Theme Park in Lagunitas located in Marin County, the home of the Beryl Buck Theme Park, called The Buck Institute on Aging, where growing old is frowned upon. Whether anyone can really solve this problem, outside Fantasy Writers, remains to be seen. Beryl Buck was not a Peter Pan and Wendy freak, as far as I can tell, but, Michael Jackson was. Before he bought the California Property for his Neverland, he looked at the Castle ‘The Towers’ built on Dark Island by the President of the Singer company. He modeled this castle after Fair Rosamond Clifford who had a Theme Labyrinth built around her at Woodstock, where a zoo was built. Sir Walter Scott claims he found the lost blueprints for Rosamond’s Bower, and wrote Woodstock. Washington Irving stayed with Scott, and exchanged letters with Henry Brevoort, the ancestor of Roberty Brevoort Buck, whose law firm created the Buck Trust and Foundation, and, mishandled the Creative Estate of Christine Rosamond Benton-Presco, a descendant of the Stuttmeister and Jankes. My later sister was the world famous artist ‘Rosamond’.\n\nThe Buck-Brevoort family founded Greenwich Village, and were Knickerbocker Royalty. Catherine de Navarre Brevoort claims she has ties to French Royalty and her husband built a Chateau around her. A month ago I founded the Land of the Wendlings inside the boundaries of Marin County in order to tap in the 1.7 billion dollar Buck Foundation. It only occurs to me now, that Wendy is a Wendling.\n\nIs Adolph Mailliard in the Bonaparte Family Tree, and thus he is kin to Marie Louis Von Habsburg who married Napoleon, and is kin to Empress Zita who is seen in this painting I stand in front of, it my mission to see it is returned to the People of Austria.\n\nI now SEE where all this is leading! I SEE a Fantastic Theme Park in Larkspur! I SEE Atlantis and the Eternal Time Machine! I see The Best of the Best in Human History gathered in one place. I SEE a………Never World Fair! I SEE ships heading to The Land of Helen of Troy where there once was a Great Labyrinth! I SEE – Science! I SEE Count Cipriani inspecting his portable house that will be put on a ship bound for San Francisco! I see the six portable houses that Carl Janke brought around the Cape, and erected in Belmont in 1848 for Gold Miners who have struck it rich.

I SEE a International Festival, a World Bank of Commerce, Trade, and the Arts!\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elizabeth_Patterson_Bonaparte\n\nI make an appeal to Robert Brevoort Buck, to make amends. I SEE us sitting at a great table talking to The Walt Disney Company.\n\nThe traffic in Los Angeles is getting worse. Getting to Disneyland is almost impossible. I SEE fairies and BART carrying Believers in The American Dream – to a New Land!\n\nJon Presco\n\nCopyright 2017\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marie_Louise,_Duchess_of_Parma\n\nhe Woodacre Improvement Club (WIC) was built on the site of Adolph Mailliard’s “Castle Rock” home.\n\nNapoleon’s big brother Joseph, ex-King of Spain, likely sired “natural son” Louis Mailliard, whose grandson Adolph lived with both families in New Jersey until doctors advised him to relocate to a healthier climate with his wife Ann Ward & at least 2 children, John & 10 yr old Joseph. In 1868 the trip via Panama took 3 weeks. He had purchased the entire San Geronimo Valley, sight unseen, for the exorbitant amount of $50,000. When he was working in SF for a short time prior to that in 1850, the same land had been sold for a mere $1,000. The home they built (three times) in what would become Woodacre had 18 rooms, 11 fireplaces, 3 conflagrations & many visitors, including Alexander Graham Bell who installed the 1st telephone line in California there – ironic that cell phone reception is still iffy. Ann’s sister Julia visited often & they would sing her composition “The Battle Hymn of the Republic.”\n\nhttp://www.mdhs.org/betsy-bonaparte/author/admin\n\nAn historic landmark on the island, “The Towers”, was long known as “Dark Island Castle” until recently renamed “Singer Castle”. The island is situated only a few yards south of the Canada-United States border that runs along the river.\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elizabeth_Patterson_Bonaparte\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Walt_Disney_Company\n\nNeverland Valley Ranch (renamed Sycamore Valley Ranch)[1] is a developed property in Santa Barbara County, California, located at 5225 Figueroa Mountain Road, Los Olivos, California 93441, first opened in 1988. It is most famous for being the home of the American entertainer Michael Jackson.[2] Jackson named the property after Neverland, the fantasy island in the story of Peter Pan, a boy who never grows up. Michael’s first encounter with the ranch came when he visited Paul McCartney, who was staying there during their filming of the “Say Say Say” video. According to La Toya Jackson, Michael expressed interest to her in someday owning the property at that time\n\nThis morning I opened an email from my kin, Murray Oltman, and read the proof of what I have been saying for over ten years, being, Augusta Stuttmeister, the beloved wife of William Oltman Stuttmeister, is kin to Carl Arugusta Janke the co-founder, if not sole founder of the City of Belmont California.\n\nWilliam August Janke, native of Hamburg, Germany, born Dec. 25, 1842, died Nov. 22, 1902, son of Carl August & Dorette Catherine Janke.\n\nCarl Janke came to San Francisco in 1848, one year before the Gold Rush. According to an article in the DAR, he brought six portable houses around the Cape and erected them in Belmont for gold miners who had struck it rich. As fate would have it, William Ralston ‘The Man Who Built San Francisco’ and his partner, lived in Belmont in a house that still stands, called Ralston Hall. I believe this is one of Janke’s homes that Coun Leonetto Cipriani purchased, and added on to. This house had 5,000 screws in it according to one (lost) article I read. Another lost article said these homes were manufactured in Mass. then shipped to California. I suspect two of these homes are found on Dolores Street in the Mission. One article said one house was moved a distance from the Tanforan ranch. The name Tanforan may have been the name of the Theme Park that Janke built in Belmont, perhaps the first in California. It also might be Turnverein, the German gymnastic clubs of the Forty-Eighters. There is much evidence the Stuttmeisters were members of the Turner Societies of Free-thinkers.\n\nWhat is truly astounding, is that Sir Thomas Hesketh married Florence Sharon at Ralston Hall, and Florence Breckenridge married their son. Florence descends from John Witherspoon,and thus is kin to the Jessie Benton Fremont, thus the Presco family, when Christine Rosamond Presco married Garth Benton.\n\nThis is truly a Rags to Riches story. Christine and I used to take walks in Piedmont where the Sharon family lived. The Hesketh family are in the Peereage.\n\nThen there is the Oddfellow gathering in Belmont that may have been staged by William Ralston. The Oddfellows were forming a union with the Freemasons and holding Knights Templar titles. Was the Stuttmeister-Janke union a Masonic-Odfellow marriage? If so, my family owns all those legends that Dan Brown gathered into his basket to create a money-making work of fiction.\n\nWhen my daughter gets married, I will do all that is humanly and divinely possible to see that she ties the night at Ralston Hall, because; “All’s wll, that ends well!”\n\nJon Presco\n\nCopyright 2011\n\nIn 1858, when Elizabeth Patterson Bonaparte was seventy-three years old, she lamented “My Beauty is departed,” a sentiment she had uttered for decades. Her beauty had been celebrated throughout her life. In her youth, she was thought the most beautiful woman in America. Her appearance was the thing of legends and, in 1803, drew Jérôme Bonaparte to Baltimore to meet the “exquisite creature” described to him.\n\nFor a woman whose beauty was central to her identity, aging must have been difficult. Rather than embracing the changes time wrought, Elizabeth defied them. Her account books documents a recipe for hair dye, as well as various compounds to create creams and possibly cosmetics. If she must age, she was going to do it as gracefully as possible.\n\nAs early as 1815 when Elizabeth was 30, a letter from her friend Elizabeth Godefroy suggests that Elizabeth saw her looks declining. Godefroy assures her, “I do not believe you about your looks.” Perhaps she attributed her visible aging to the strain and stress of Napoléon’s annulment, her return to her father’s unwelcoming home in Baltimore and her (successful) suit for divorce from Jérôme. Life had been, as Elizabeth once said, “a mean and grinding martyrdom.” Such emotional misery is not easy on the looks.\n\nDespite her perception of her appearance, Elizabeth’s beauty is documented in several surviving portraits. In 1838 when Elizabeth was 53, she had her silhouette cut in Rockaway Beach, New York. The solid black image depicts her in profile with a softening jawline and an appropriately middle-aged appearance. The silhouette is the last known image of her that survives. To date, no photographs of her are known. Instead, Elizabeth commissioned copies of her portraits to give as gifts. How did this woman look at 40, 60, 90?\n\nFlorence Louise Breckinridge was born in November 1881 at California, U.S.A..2 She married Thomas Fermor-Hesketh, 1st Baron Hesketh, son of Sir Thomas George Fermor-Hesketh, 7th Bt. and Florence Emily Sharon, on 9 September 1909 at British Embassy Church, Paris, France.\n\n1888: From the Daily Alta, an article on the marriage of Dr. William O.\n\nStuttmeister and Augusta D. Janke.\n\nDaily Alta California, Volume 42, Number 14175, 24 June 1888\n\nSTUTTMEISTER-JANKE.\n\nOne of the most enjoyable weddings of the past week took place at\n\nBelmont, Wednesday morning last, the contracting parties being Miss\n\nAugusta Janke, daughter of Mr. and Mrs. August Janke of Belmont,\n\nand Dr. Wm. Stuttmeister of San Francisco. The house was\n\nhandsomely decorated with a rich profusion of ferns and flowers, and\n\nat the appointed hour was filled with the relatives and intimate friends\n\nof the contracting parties. At 11 o’clock the wedding march was played\n\nand the bridal party entered the parlor. The bride was attended by Miss\n\nAlice Stuttmeister, a sister of the groom, and Miss Minnie Janke, a\n\nsister of the bride, as bridesmaids, and Dr. Muldownado and Wm.\n\nJanke, a cousin of the bride, were groomsmen. The Rev. A. L. Brewer\n\nof San Mateo performed the beautiful and impressive ceremony under\n\nan arch composed of flowers and greens very prettily arranged, after\n\nwhich the guests pressed forward and offered their congratulations.\n\nThe bride was attired in a very pretty and becoming costume of the\n\ncrushed strawberry shade, and wore a corsage bouquet of orange\n\nblossoms. She carried a handsome bouquet of white flowers. After the\n\nguests had paid their compliments the bride and groom led the way to\n\nthe dining-room, where the wedding dinner was served and the health\n\nof the newly married pair was pledged. The feast over, the guests\n\njoined in the dance, and the hours sped right merrily, interspersed with\n\nmusic singing and recitations, until the bride and groom took their\n\ndeparture amid a shower of rice and good wishes. Many beautiful\n\npresents were received. Dr. and Mrs. Stuttmeister left Thursday\n\nmorning for Santa Cruz and Monterey, where they will spend the\n\nhoneymoon. On their return they will make their home in Belmont.\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marie_Louise,_Duchess_of_Parma\n\nAfter escaping an assassination attempt in Vienna while negotiating the Treaty of Schönbrunn on 12 October 1809, Emperor Napoleon decided that he needed an heir to cement his relatively young Empire.[9] He also sought the validation and legitimation of his Empire by marrying a member of one of the leading royal families of Europe. He began proceedings to divorce Joséphine de Beauharnais, who did not bear him a son, and began searching for a new empress. His wish to marry Grand Duchess Anna Pavlovna of Russia, the youngest daughter of Tsar Paul I of Russia, caused alarm in Austria, who were afraid of being sandwiched between two great powers allied with each other.[10] At the persuasion of Count Metternich, a marriage between Napoleon and Marie Louise was suggested by Emperor Francis to the Count of Narbonne[11][12] but no official overture was made by the Austrians.[13] Though officials in Paris and Austria were beginning to accept the possibility of the union, Marie Louise was kept uninformed of developments.[14]\n\nFrustrated by the Russians delaying the marriage negotiations, Napoleon rescinded his proposal in late January 1810 and began negotiations to marry Marie Louise with the Austrian ambassador, the Prince of Schwarzenberg.[15] Schwarzenberg signed the marriage contract on 7 February.[16] Marie Louise was informed of the marriage by Metternich.[17] When asked for consent, she replied: “I wish only what my duty commands me to wish.”[17]\n\n1911: Dr. Willian O.

He bought two vacation properties in San Geronimo where he retired and died. The Maillard, Count Cipriani, Napoleon, and Prince Victor Napoleon connection is interesting. Is this the continuation of the Belmont Colony? Was this land purchased with a recovered treasure? Many have searched for the lost treasure of Sir Francis Drake near this valley overlooked by the ‘Sleeping Maiden’ mountain.\n\nBelow is a video showing Cipriani’s home inside Ralston’s additions. It was a portable house. An expert needs to compare this with the Tanforan cottages. Samples of the wood and screws need to taken and compared to the houses Janke brought around the Cape. William married Augusta Janke.\n\nGeneration No. 1\n\n1.

Victor\n\nEmanuel had made him Governor of Balogna, and he would become the\n\nfirst President of the United Kingdom of Italy. Cipriani would marry\n\nan American, Mary Tolly Worhtington of Baltimore County who a\n\ndescendant of George Washington. Cipriani descends from the famous\n\nCaracciolo family of Naples, and appears to be the son of Napoeleon’s\n\nmajor dommo, Franchesci Cipriani. The whole truth is not being told\n\nhere, and Cipriani may have been playing down the royal hand he was\n\ndealt.\n\nJerome Bonaparte married Elizabeth Patterson, and wealthy\n\nheiress. Emperor Napoleon had marred Marie-Louis von Habsburg, and it\n\nwas a Habsburg that be amply qualified to become the first Emperor of\n\nMexico. Napoleon III. gave the emigrants troops, French financial\n\ncircles assured their assistance. The French supported the\n\nconservatives in the civil war with the radicals and occupied the\n\ncapital. They planned an expansion of France on the American soul.\n\nCipriani built the farmhouse shown on the left in 1852 in Italy (probably Corsica, his home), had it dismantled, packed in labeled wooden crates amounting to 150 tons, shipped to San Francisco and then hauled in wagons 22 miles south to Cañada del Diablo, now known as Belmont in central San Mateo County.\n\nIn the mid-1860s, Bank of California founder William Chapman Ralston sought a country place conducive to entertaining and purchased, “tore down, built up and embellished” Cipriani’s Belmont villa (Sacramento Daily Union 1888) to create “The White House of the West.”\n\nMrs. Anna Lake Townsend, a.k.a. Shirley, Philip, wrote this in her column “Freehand Notes” in the Sacramento Daily Union, July 14, 1883:\n\nAlthough there is very little boasting among Californians about their sumptuous homes, and while they accept with remarkable humility the patronizing descriptions given by the Eastern traveler of places on the Hudson, Long Island and in the suburbs of Boston, to say nothing of the oppressive claims of country-seats in England, they have really every right in the world to tell a reasonable pride in their possessions. After all the State is only thirty years old, and the luxurious laying out of Monterey, the magnificence of Palo Alto, the San Mateo and Menlo Park residences, and the white glories of Belmont and its ivy-covered stone stable, make a wonderful showing of wealth and taste, and, at a certain season, of enlightened hospitality.\n\nThe most historical of all these residences, the richest is associations, the most widely known outside of California, is undoubtedly Belmont, now the property of Mr. Sharon, and formerly that of the brilliant, restless and ill-starred Ralston…. The nucleus, so to speak, of the house as it now is was built by General Cipriani, an Italian patriot who had fought with Garibaldi, and came to California somewhat richer in money than many patriots-Italian or other nationality-and built at Belmont.\n\n|\n\nMaria Ludovica of Austria, Empress of France\n\nPosted on by\n\nLocation\n\nThe Inkwells are small, deep, dark pools beside Sir Francis Drake Boulevard in Lagunitas, West Marin. They aren’t marked, but they’re easy to find. When driving along Drake Boulevard, the Inkwells are just beyond where the houses stop and Samuel P. Taylor State Park begins. As you cross a bridge called Shafter Bridge, the Inkwells are directly on your right, underneath a reddish-colored bridge called the Inkwells Bridge. You walk down a crumbly path to the right of Inkwells Bridge to get to the beautiful, swimmable pools along Lagunitas Creek. There are two of them, one bigger than the other. There are rocks to jump off of and sun to bask in. It is the perfect place for a summer afternoon!\n\nThe San Geronimo Valley, including Lagunitas and Lagunitas creek where the Inkwells are, was largely uninhabited and untouched until the 19th century. In the 19th century railroad transportation made it easy to bring goods and passengers through the valley, thereby popularizing the gorgeous area.\n\nFrom 1875 to 1935 the North Pacific Coast Railroad, then the Northwestern Pacific Railroad, operated trains from Sausalito to Pt. Reyes Station and then farther north to Cazadero in Sonoma. Originally the railroad transported lumber, dairy products, oysters, and other goods from the fertile lands of West Marin. Later the railroad began transporting passengers. The tracks went directly alongside the Lagunitas Creek, and the old railroad right-of-way can be found on the other side of the red-colored Inkwells Bridge from Sir Francis Drake Boulevard.\n\nDuring the 1870’s and 80’s, tourists rode this train from San Francisco to a hotel resort and campgrounds in what is now Samuel P. Taylor State Park.\n\nIn 1974 the county purchased the rail line from Lagunitas to Tocaloma for trail use. There are extensive trails all over the area, and the 2004 construction of the Inkwells Bridge provided a missing link in the Bay Area Ridge Trail. The Bay Area Ridge Trail is a 500-mile continuing trail that circles the Bay Area (sections already exist in the Headlands and on Big Rock Ridge). The bridge connects Kent Lake trails with the old railroad grade pathway that runs 8 miles through Samuel P. Taylor to Tocaloma Bridge Road. The Inkwells bridge provides hikers and bicyclists a safe way to explore the beautiful San Geronimo Valley away from street traffic.\n\nThe bridge also serves an important infrastructural purpose: it has two 36″ water pipes that carry water from Kent Lake and the Nicasio Reservoir to the water treatment plant providing drinking water to north-central Marin.\n\nhttps://www.heldfond.com/pages/books/8854/a-collection-of-early-marin-county-subdivision-maps\n\nSince I can recall, Rosemary told me and my brother we descend from Teutonic Knights on our father’s side. Eight years ago I found a Stutenmeister province in Estonia that appears to be named after a Teutonic Knight, who purchased this land.\n\nI also found a Stuttmeister Estate in the Pankow where the summer homes of the very wealthy are located. This estate is now a resturant. The Stuttmeister owned about five properties in Berlin.\n\nEleven years ago I found the unmarked grave of Royal Reuben Rosamond, and my aunt Lillian bought a stone with roses.\n\nSix years ago my cousin, Daryl Bulkley, located the lost Stuttmeister crypt in Colma, and I went there with my daughter and new born grandson, Tyler Hunt. With the help of Murray Oltman, our family is more visible and united.\n\nDescendants of Dorthia Matilda Oltman\n\nGeneration No. 1\n\n1.
