        "text": "On June 1, 1879 AD, an event occurred that shocked the whole world: in South Africa, in a battle with the Zulus near the Ityotyozi River, twenty-two-year-old British lieutenant Napoleon Eugene Bonaparte (Napoleon Eugene Louis Jean Joseph, 1856–1879 AD) went missing. Only son of the late Napoleon III. For Bonapartists - Emperor Napoleon IV.\n\nIt was believed, among other things, that he was supported by Russia. In May 1874 AD, during a visit to Great Britain, Emperor Alexander II made a special trip to the military school in Woolwich, where the young Napoleon studied. And for a long time, emphatically affectionately, he talked with him.\n\nIt became a real sensation. In France, the Republic held its eighth year, causing more and more anxiety of the European monarchies. But the Bonapartists were still strong. Their deputies sat in parliament. They had support in the army, and the police were generally considered the reserve of Napoleons. And now - the only heir to the throne died - unexpectedly and absurdly.\n\nThe next in seniority was his cousin, the son of the youngest of the brothers of Napoleon I, Jerome, King of Westphalia (Jerome Bonaparte, roi de Westphale, 1784–1860 AD) - Prince Napoleon Joseph, nicknamed the Red Prince (Napoleon Joseph Charles Paul, Prince Napoleon, 1822–1891 AD).\n\nA highly controversial contender, constant troublemaker of the Second Empire, leader of the left opposition, almost a socialist. For Russia, in particular, he was completely unacceptable: at one time, Prince Joseph in London met with Herzen, subsidized Russian emigrants, and supported the uprising in Poland. The Red Prince was expected to renounce his rights to the throne. But no - he zealously took up the role of Napoleon V.\n\nIn 1884 AD, relying on the right wing of the party, especially on the new generation, the eldest son of the applicant, Prince Victor Napoleon (Napoleon Victor Jerome Frederic Bonaparte, 1862–1926 AD), proclaimed himself a pretender.\n\nHis father renounced him and declared him heir younger son- Prince Louis Napoleon Bonaparte.\n\nPrince Napoleon Joseph, father of Louis Iosifovich Bonaparte. Hippolyte Flandrin, “Portrait of Prince Napoleon”, 1860 AD\n\nLouis Napoleon Joseph Jerome Bonaparte (Louis Napoleon Joseph Jerome Bonaparte), Prince of the French Empire, was born on June 16, 1864 AD, in the castle of Meudon - during these years the Second Empire flourished. His mother, Princess Clotilde (Marie-Clothilde de Savoie, 1843–1911 AD), was the daughter of Victor Emmanuel II (Vittorio Emanuele II, 1820–1878 AD), King of Italy. According to his maternal grandmother, the prince was a descendant of the Habsburgs of Austria.\n\nThin, hook-nosed, Prince Louis Napoleon for some reason, unlike his father, did not at all resemble his great grandfather, Napoleon Bonaparte. But for some reason, he was very reminiscent of his uncle, Napoleon III (Napoleon III, Louis Napoleon Bonaparte, 1808-1873), from his youth he wore the same beard and the famous imperial mustache.\n\nIn 1874 AD his father returned with his family from exile to France. Prince Louis, together with his older brother, studied at the Lyceum in Vanves, then at the Charlemagne Lyceum in the capital.\n\nIn Paris, despite all the upheavals, his own aunt, the famous Princess Mathilde Bonaparte (Mathilde Letizia Wilhelmine Bonaparte, 1820-1904, 1820-1904), shone then.\n\nPrincess Mathilde Bonaparte\n\nAt one time she visited Russia, her husband was Anatoly Nikolaevich Demidov (1813–1870 AD) from a famous Ural family - one of the richest people in the world; in order to match his wife, he bought the title of Prince of San Donato.\n\nMatilda broke up with her Russian husband almost thirty years ago, but retained some connections in Russia, including at court. And she lived on the remnants of income from the Ural factories, which she got during the divorce.\n\nThe Hotel Mathilde on the Rue Berry was the headquarters of the most brilliant and daring Parisian bohemia. At the age of eighteen, Prince Louis settled with his aunt and instantly turned into a classic socialite varmint.\n\nThe highly moral Red Prince was worried. At his urging, in 1884 AD, Louis volunteered for the 31st Infantry Regiment in Blois. The Prince of the Empire willingly donned the greatcoat of a Republic infantryman. he dreamed of a military career since childhood, as a man named Bonaparte should. In 1885 AD is demobilized with the rank of sergeant.\n\nIn 1885-86 AD, Prince Napoleon made a great journey through Asia, starting in Egypt, Constantinople, India, China, and ending in Tokyo, where he was honored to be the first European in history to be invited to dine with a Japanese empress.\n\nIn 1886 AD, the republican parliament passed a law that shook the whole of royal-imperial Europe: families claiming the throne were expelled from the country. Three rival clans, the Bourbons, Orleans and Bonapartes, have become a tribe of outcasts.\n\nThe prince met the news of the expulsion of his father and brother from France in the United States, where he lived with his relative Jerome Bonaparte-Patterson. He decides to return to Europe.\n\nPrince Louis traveled to Moncalieri, a town in northern Italy where his mother lived. Princess Clotilde separated from her husband a long time ago, peacefully, without an official divorce. She had been a member of the Dominican Order for fourteen years and had devoted her life to serving the poor and the sick.\n\nSoon, Louis was taken under his wing by his uncle, King Umberto I (King Humbert, Umberto I, 1844–1900 AD).\n\nThe prince became an Italian citizen and in 1887 AD entered the rank of lieutenant in the 13th Regiment of Chevolegers (Uhlans). A year and a half later, he was already a captain. He served modestly and diligently - first in Verona, then in Monferrato.\n\nIn the autumn of 1890 AD, the Iveria newspaper reported:\n\n“On Wednesday night, Prince Louis-Napoleon arrived from Batumi by passenger train, heading to the Nizhny Novgorod Dragoon Regiment.”\n\nThe twenty-six-year-old prince was promoted to the rank of lieutenant colonel.\n\nThe enrollment of Bonaparte in the Russian cavalry was a thoughtful, important political action. The Bonapartists again stirred up in France and abroad; it was again said that Russia supported the Napoleonic dynasty.\n\nWhat made Prince Louis go to Russia? Partly, of course, that the grandmother of Prince Louis, Queen Catherine of Württemberg, was the cousin of Alexander I and Nicholas I. So, the reigning emperor Alexander III was his fourth cousin.\n\nThe current dominant branch of the Napoleonic dynasty comes from the brother of Napoleon I, Jerome Bonaparte, King of Westphalia, whose royal title was recognized by the Russian Empire in Tilsit. And he was married and had heirs Jerome with Katharina of Württemberg (born in St. Petersburg), the native niece of the Empress of All Russia Maria Feodorovna, nee Sophia Dorothea of ​​Württemberg, mother of Nicholas I.\n\nIt was an amazing and legendary regiment (of the King of Württemberg, grandfather of Alexander III, through whom Napoleon was related to the Romanovs), who had been in the Caucasus for a century. Among other things, it was a kind of Russian foreign legion. Foreigners were sent there, who, for one reason or another, were difficult to keep in the capital. Lieutenant Colonel Bonaparte was quite in the spirit of the Nizhny Novgorod dragoons - one last name was worth it.\n\nNizhny Novgorod, 17th Dragoon, His Majesty's Regiment\n\nThe combat exploits of the Nizhny Novgorod people evoked the following words of Emperor Alexander II: \"Nizhny Novgorod I consider my first cavalry regiment.\"\n\nThe difficult combat school that the regiment went through brought forward from among its ranks a number of military personnel who played a major role in the conquest of the Caucasus and contributed many glorious pages to the history of our army.\n\nK. F. Steel\n\nbook. A. G. Chavchavadze\n\nN. N. Raevsky\n\nF. L. Krukovsky\n\nbook. Ya. I. Chavchavadze\n\nbook. A. M. Dondukov-Korsakov\n\nbook. I. G. Amilakhvari\n\nN. P. Grabbe\n\nZ. G. Chavchavadze\n\nN.P. Sleptsov\n\nI. I. Shabelsky\n\nA. F. Baggovut\n\nThey began their service in the ranks of the Nizhny Novgorod regiment or commanded it.\n\nThe regiment had the following insignia:\n\nSt. George's standard with the inscription: \"For the distinction rendered in the Persian War of 1826, 1827, 1828, for excellent deeds in Chechnya in 1851 and in the battle of Kyuryuk-Dara on July 24, 1854.\" and \"1701-1901\", with the Alexander jubilee ribbon;\n\nbadges on hats with the inscription \"For Distinction\";\n\n17 St. George Trumpets with the inscription: \"For excellent deeds in the defeat of the 36,000th Turkish corps on the Bashkadiklar heights on November 19, 1853\";\n\nbuttonholes for military distinction on the uniforms of headquarters and chief officers and lower ranks;\n\nwide St. George ribbons to the standards with the inscription: in the 1st d-zone - \"For the battle of October 2 and 3, 1877 on the Aladzhinsky heights\" and in the 2nd d-zone - \"For the deeds at Begli-Akhmet on May 18 and on the Orlovsky heights October 2, 1877\";\n\na special form (gazyri on uniforms and stripes on breeches) and Asian drafts of the sample, approved in the reign of Emperor Nicholas I.\n\nThe lists of the Nizhny Novgorod regiment included the Heir Tsesarevich Grand Duke Alexei Nikolaevich from March 26, 1906 AD.\n\nEmperors Alexander II (from July 12, 1864 AD to March 1, 1881 AD) and Alexander III (from November 27, 1881 AD to October 21, 1894 AD) and V. Kn. Mikhail Nikolaevich (from 13.10.1863 AD to 30.12.1909 AD).\n\nFrom 1891 AD, Prince Louis was already a colonel, commander of a regiment stationed in Pyatigorsk.\n\nOn March 18, 1891 AD, Louis' father, Prince Napoleon Joseph, died. According to his will, both the property and all the rights of the emperor in exile were received by the second son. But the Russian dragoon was not going to quarrel with his brother because of the name of Napoleon VI and did not insist on the execution of the will. Victor and Louis divided the paternal inheritance by mutual agreement. Colonel Ludovik Iosifovich received the Prangins castle, in Switzerland, not far from Lausanne.\n\nIn 1897 AD, Prince Louis Napoleon unexpectedly received Her Majesty's Ulansky Regiment, which was part of the 2nd Guards Cavalry Division, stationed in Peterhof, in command of the Life Guards. It was commanded by Lieutenant General Georgy Antonovich de Scalon (1847–1914 AD), a descendant of the French Huguenots.\n\nThis magnificent division was overshadowed by several crowns. In the 1st brigade, in addition to Ulansky, there was the Life Guards Horse Grenadier Regiment, commanded by Grand Duke Dmitry Konstantinovich (1860–1919 AD). In the second brigade - the Dragoon Life Guards, whose chief was Grand Duke Vladimir Alexandrovich (1847–1909AD); and a horse artillery battalion, its commander was Grand Duke Sergei Mikhailovich (1869–1918 AD).\n\nSo Prince Louis Napoleon was, in fact, ranked among the closest kindred circle of the king. To top it off, he was awarded the highest order of the Empire - St. Andrew the First-Called. Without special historical merit, they were awarded only to members of the ruling dynasties. The Bonapartes were not. The order is evidence of the mysterious disposition of the third Russian tsar to the Napoleonides. Nicholas II openly patronized his personal Bonaparte.\n\nHowever, in the guard, Prince Louis somehow did not take root. Former officer of the Life Lancers Regiment Count Aleksey Alekseevich Ignatiev (1877–1954 AD) wrote in his memoirs:\n\n“Skalon ... he himself began serving in this regiment, loved him and was not particularly pleased, seeing another, true, French, imperial highness, Prince Louis-Napoleon, at the head of the uhlans.”\n\nIn addition, the Empress Alexandra Fedorovna, chief of the Ulan regiment, began to supplant the prince. She intensively promoted her protege, Colonel Alexander Orlov, to the commanders.\n\nIn 1902 AD, Louis Napoleon, with the rank of major general, was sent to the Caucasus to command the 1st Caucasian Cavalry Division.\n\nAn elite regiment, then an illustrious division - a great career. And it is worth noting that on the same relationship with the tsar, Napoleon's great-nephew would not have taken off so soon from Italian captains to Russian generals.\n\nIn 1905 AD, unrest began throughout the country, including in the Transcaucasian provinces. Prince Louis severely suppressed armed uprisings in Kutaisi.\n\nFrom the newspapers: Tiflis, 21. 09. “..The report of Prince Napoleon, the Governor-General of Erivan, testifies that the bloody clashes between Muslims and Armenians that have resumed in Erivan have not yet stopped and threaten to take on serious proportions…”\n\nThen he was appointed military governor of the Erivan province. Rumors spread in the capital: the tsar was ready to entrust the entire Caucasus to General Bonaparte.\n\n“Instead of Vorontsov, Prince Louis-Napoleon is sent to the Caucasus as a viceroy!”\n\nBut this was belated information. The longtime governor of the Caucasus, Count Illarion Ivanovich Vorontsov-Dashkov (1837–1916 AD), ousted his foreign rival without much difficulty.\n\nCaucasian Military District\n\nWas formed in 1865 AD. After a series of changes in 1866, 1868, 1878, 1881, 1883, 1898 and 1899 AD, in 1906 AD the Caucasian Military District included: 7 provinces (Stavropol, Tiflis, Kutaisi, Elisavetpol, Baku, Erivan and Black Sea) and 5 regions (Kuban, Terek, Dagestan, Karsk and Batum) - a total of 12 administrative divisions, of which 3 in the North Caucasus, 9 - in the Transcaucasus, forming Caucasian governorship, whose viceroy at the same time was also the commander-in-chief of the district troops.\n\nThe Caucasian Military District occupied an area of ​​8,476 sq. miles (412,311 sq. versts) with a population of 11.735.100 (1911 AD), or 1391.6 inhabitants. per 1 sq. mile (in European Russia 1375 per 1 sq. mile). The largest population was in the Tiflis province (1,587.6) and the Kuban region (1,543.5), the smallest - in the Black Sea province (842.8) and the Terek region (906.5).\n\nThe Caucasian military district was multi-tribal and multi-lingual in population, diverse in religion, interesting in its own way. ancient history, rich in nature, mountainous in relief, healthy in climate, famous for military events that have acquired unfading glory for Russian weapons, and at the same time very important militarily.\n\nRussia had here the only land border with Turkey, and only from here could Russia reach Persian Gulf(Indian Ocean), that is, an ice-free outlet.\n\nThe relief of the district, despite its pronounced mountainous character (alpine landscape), allowed for the conduct of war by large armies, with the exception of some areas, such as: the main Caucasian ridge, Dagestan region, Kutaisi province, Batumi region and some other smaller areas.\n\nThe territory of the district was divided by the main Caucasian ridge into two sharply different parts.\n\nThe first - the North Caucasus, otherwise Ciscaucasia - was the richest base for the other part - Transcaucasia, which could represent a probable theater of military operations in a defensive war.\n\nThe entire defense of Transcaucasia was reduced mainly to the question of communication routes linking Transcaucasia with the empire in general and with Ciscaucasia and with the Turkestan military district in particular.\n\nIn this regard, despite the fact that there was no pass railway across the Caucasus Range, it must be admitted that the connection between Transcaucasia and the empire was satisfactory (Vladikavkaz, Transcaucasian and Black Sea railways).\n\nIn addition to the existing direct, albeit circular, railway route through Baku and the projected coastal Black Sea railway, Transcaucasia was connected by two waterways - with the Volga along the Caspian Sea (the disadvantage is reloading from Volga river ships to sea ships) and with the southern ports of European Russia Black by sea.\n\nIt was believed that the pass railroad would improve, speed up and more ensure communication with the Transcaucasus, but from a military point of view, besides it, other equally important operational routes in the Transcaucasus were needed, including highways, which in mountainous countries have a very large importance and which were very few in Transcaucasia.\n\nThe food resources of the district were large, and the active armies could well be provided; bread and fodder - mainly from the North Caucasus, livestock everywhere.\n\nDue to the weak population and mountainous nature, the deployment of troops and the collection of supplies was difficult. The North Caucasus was rich in horses, but in Transcaucasia there were few of them, and they were of a small breed. Weights were transported mostly on oxen and donkeys; the main type of wagon in the mountains was a two-wheeled arba.\n\nIn the district were quartered; I, II and III Caucasian corps with their cavalry and auxiliary troops.\n\nFortresses: Kars and Mikhailovskaya (Batum).\n\nAt the end of 1905 AD, after another loud quarrel with the viceroy, Lieutenant General Bonaparte resigned. The year before, Princess Mathilde had died. Prince Louis received the entire inheritance from his aunt. This also hastened his departure.\n\nBut Louis did not cut off ties in Russia. In 1908 AD he visited the Kutaisi province. He had a whole retinue with him, twelve Frenchmen. Bonaparte drove along the Black Sea coast: Poti, Zugdidi, the Chkaduani estate - his relative and girlfriend, Princess Salome Murat, lived there.\n\nIn 1868 AD Achille Charles Louis Napoleon Prince Murat (1847-1895 AD), grandson of the famous marshal Joachim Murat, Grand Admiral and Imperial Prince, King of Naples and Napoleon I's sister Caroline (Maria Annunziata) Bonaparte, married His Grace Princess Salome Dadiani- Megrelian (1848 -1913 AD). Their children emigrated to France after 1917 AD.\n\nIn 1870 AD, he settled in Russia, in the Kutaisi province, where he brought French vines. The famous \"Ojaleshi\" came from them. By the way, in the local history museum of the city of Zugdidi there was one of the death masks of Napoleon, which was kept in the Murat family.\n\nFrom 1914 AD, General Bonaparte returned to duty. Throughout the World War, he was the representative of the Emperor of Russia to the Italian General Staff - a very serious post. Terrible for Russia, 1917 AD casually touched the imperial house of France in the person of Lieutenant General Louis. His Russian career ended forever. And collapsed hopes for the general's pension, which the prince really counted on.\n\nSince that time he has lived in Switzerland. Times were difficult. A significant part of the estate was sold long ago. In 1919 AD, the new co-owner of the castle, a certain Parisian rentier, settled Karl von Habsburg, the deposed Kaiser of Austria-Hungary, in his part of Prangena. From Pranjen he led conspiracies in Austria, from there he left in 1921 AD to lead the invasion of Hungary. It is quite probable that the retired Russian general was giving advice to his irreconcilable cousin. But in general he eschewed politics for the rest of his life.\n\nIn 1926 AD, after the death of Victor Napoleon's brother Louis, he adopted his children, daughter Mathilde (later married to Sergei Witte, Mannerheim's adjutant) and son (Prince Louis Jerome Victor Emanuel Napoleon)\n\nAT last years Louis Napoleon traveled all over the world, for a long time spent in the USA and in Japan. He died in Prangene on October 14, 1932 AD, before reaching the age of seventy. After his death, the new head of the imperial house, Prince Louis Napoleon, the only son of his brother Victor (Victor Jerome Frederic Bonaparte), moved to the castle.\n\nPrangen Castle is not striking in its vastness and beauty of the facades.\n\nBuried in the Basilica di Superga (Torino)\n\nLudwig Iosifovich never married. But this did not mean that he was indifferent to women. Most likely - on the contrary. Gossip Alexandra Bogdanovich wrote about him:\n\n“Bad information about him. The Armenians bought him as a gift when they sent him to Kutais to pacify him - they gave him a beauty, with whom he was captivated, locked himself up with her and forgot about the riots. Now this beauty accompanies him everywhere, and for her the Armenians are in his favour.”\n\nAnd this is far from the only novel by Louis Bonaparte in Russia. There may be descendants. Back in the 1920s AD, this exciting consideration was expressed by the writer Konstantin Vaginov (the son of a St. Petersburg gendarmerie colonel, his real name von Wagenheim, 1899–1934 AD) in the autobiographical story “The Works and Days of Svistonov”:\n\n“Great,” thought Svistonov, “Chavchavadze is the Georgian ambassador under Paul I ... Pole. - he thought, - It would be necessary to have another Pole. Moreover, to invent an illegitimate son of one of the Bonapartes, who commanded a Russian regiment in the 1880s.”\n\nPerhaps the writer was not just fantasizing, but tasting a certain rumor, and the genealogy of the Russian Bonapartes does not end at the first generation.\n\nNow the head of the dynasty is Charles Napoleon.\n\nThis week, a Memorandum was signed on Borisov's accession to the European Federation of Napoleonic Cities.\n\nAn event, consider, of a global scale. Now we are officially included in the \"Roads of Napoleon\" program, and this is another good chance to prove ourselves abroad. An incentive for the visit of tourists, because today, according to queries in Internet search engines, only Jesus Christ is more popular than the great French emperor. And now it is enough to ask the request \"Napoleon\" anywhere in the world - and you will receive information about the battle on the Berezina and its environs. Why not see the legendary places with your own eyes? And there really is something to see here, did not hide his emotions in a conversation with the SB correspondent, the president of the federation, Charles Napoleon, a descendant of the legendary Bonaparte, and at the same time shared the details of his family history.\n\nHere is what he said: “As you know, there are no direct descendants of Napoleon left. My ancestor Jerome - the younger brother of the French emperor, who was the king of Westphalia - at that time a small kingdom in the territory modern Germany. It turns out that Napoleon is my great-great ... in a word, my uncle is in the sixth generation, and our family is recognized as the main heirs.\n\nJerome Bonaparte is a rather interesting personality. At the age of 16, he already commanded units that conquered the island of Elba for France. If you remember, it was there that Emperor Napoleon would be exiled after his first abdication... And at the very beginning of the 19th century, the young lieutenant Bonaparte, on the orders of his older brother, accompanied General Leclerc to Haiti, where black slaves rebelled. When the general sent Jerome home with a request for help, the British attacked the French frigate, and the lieutenant only miraculously managed to take refuge in the territorial waters of America. In Baltimore, he fell in love with Elizabeth Paterson, the daughter of an American merchant from Maryland, they had a son, Jerome Napoleon Bonaparte-Paterson. But family happiness was short-lived: the French emperor forced his younger brother to terminate this union and return to Paris ... Later, Jerome Bonaparte participated in the Russian campaign under the command of Marshal Davout, but even before the Battle of Borodino he returned to the capital of Westphalia, Cassel, where his brother appointed him king.\n\nFUN FACT\n\nJerome's grandson, Louis Napoleon Joseph Jerome Bonaparte, served in the Russian army until 1917. He rose to the rank of general. It is known that Emperor Nicholas II patronized him. Ironically, back in the late 80s of the 18th century, Napoleon Bonaparte himself aspired to join the Russian army in order to participate in the campaign against Turkey. According to one version, he was refused, according to another, he himself did not want to agree to the conditions, because foreigners were accepted into the service with a decrease in rank ...\n\nA couple of years ago, the book of Monsieur Charles \"Unknown Napoleon - my ancestor\" became a real bestseller in France. This, by the way, is not his only work on the legendary ancestor. Former financier and banker, doctor of economic sciences, Charles also managed to visit the vice-mayor of the French town of Ajaccio - the birthplace of Napoleon Bonaparte.\n\nAs far as I understand the life of my distant ancestor, he was at the same time one of the greatest military leaders on earth, and the great reformer of France. I mean that he lived in step with that era, the era of the French Revolution. And his conquests were an occasion to spread throughout Europe the socio-political achievements that she brought with her. The institutions he created still exist today. And besides the war of 1812, we can now also talk about the political struggle between the values ​​of the French Revolution and the conservative views of the monarchy.\n\nTo resolve conflicts in that era, Europe gave preference to weapons. And Napoleon united under his banners about 20 European countries including Austria and Prussia. Not least, his descendant believes, because he had a magnificent gift of persuasion. But when the Napoleonic army set foot on our lands in 1812, it did not at all become the usual victorious march.\n\nWhen we in France talk about the Berezina, we mean a catastrophe. This is not the first time I have been to Borisov, and every time I am amazed that such a fierce battle took place on such a quiet river. And I would like through our federation to make these places known to tourists all over the world. So that they can come and see with their own eyes where and how everything happened. Unfortunately, despite the fact that the very name of the Berezina in France is a household name, almost no one knows where this river is located.\n\nEmperor Napoleon Bonaparte in our view was a short man. Hence even popular expression\"Napoleon complex\". Although in reality his height was 168 centimeters - in those days even above average. But his descendant Charles is head and shoulders above those around him. Stately, with a French-Italian aristocratic appearance. However, as soon as you talk to him, you understand that the facial features, albeit remotely, but still resemble a textbook image from portraits. However, our interlocutor is also not a simpleton - with the title of prince. I wonder if he himself sees any similarities with his ancestor?\n\nIt's hard to find something in common. Still, I am me, and Napoleon is Napoleon. To be honest, it even annoys me when they see me as only the heir to the imperial dynasty. This is not my merit, but rather my karma. And in character? I think that another legacy was passed down through the centuries - a view of the world. You see, the lessons of history are how we can use them to make a difference today for the better. And most importantly, the decisions that were made in the past can help us change something now. And my distant ancestor showed that only the leader who can predict can become great. That is why Napoleon became a legend. But my philosophy is not that you can reproduce or repeat the actions of your ancestors, but to perceive life with the same optimism and the will to change.\n\nCharles Napoleon personally knows the mayors of more than 60 cities included in the European Federation of Napoleonic Cities. Now we have also got acquainted with the chairman of the Borisov regional executive committee, who is going to Paris in December to present an issue of the federation's magazine dedicated to the Belarusian city. All mayors are to some extent members of a large union, they meet, cooperate and, Monsieur Charles shared his plans for the future, it is possible that one day they will gather in Borisov.\n\nEmperor Napoleon had three sons - the legitimate son Francois-Joseph, the failed heir to the throne, and two illegitimate sons - Charles, Count Leon, and Alexander Valevsky.\n\nTheir fate turned out differently, which we, based on historical sources, will tell in this article.\n\nIn March 1796, Napoleon married Josephine de Beauharnais, who by that time already had two children from her first husband, Viscount Alexander de Beauharnais. For ten years of marriage, Napoleon and Josephine never had their own children, which, of course, terribly depressed Bonaparte. He, accustomed to victoriously solve any problems that arose before him, it was hard to get used to the idea that in this family-dynastic business he had suffered a terrible failure.\n\nIt was even rumored that the great Napoleon began to consider himself barren ...\n\nIn all other cases, except for the birth of an heir, at that time Napoleon won one victory after another and was at the peak of fortune and fame.\n\nIn 1805, he won the greatest victory of his career near Austerlitz, where the allied forces of two emperors, the Russian Alexander I and the Austrian Franz II, were defeated.\n\nAt the beginning of 1806, Napoleon returned victorious to France, where he immediately struck up a relationship with the young beauty Eleanor Denuel de la Plaigne, a lecturer, and in a modern way a reader aloud, his sister Caroline, a slender brunette with huge black eyes.\n\nEleanor was a flirtatious and witty girl from a good Parisian bourgeois family. While studying at the famous boarding school of noble maidens Madame Campan, she met Caroline Bonaparte, to whom she later got a job.\n\nThere was also an unsuccessful marriage in her life to the dragoon officer Jean Revel, who turned out to be an ordinary swindler, was arrested and imprisoned.\n\nHaving settled in the service of her friend Caroline Bonaparte, Eleanor quickly became close to her loving husband, Marshal Joachim Murat. The emperor himself, who did not like to spend a lot of time on preludes, also did not have to persuade her for a long time - Caroline, who hated Josephine, who had influence on her older brother, helped in this.\n\nThe love meetings between Napoleon and Eleanor nevertheless led to a result that both Caroline and the entire Corsican Bonaparte clan, who dreamed of diluting Napoleon with the \"stranger\" Josephine, hoped for very much - on December 13, 1806 at two o'clock in the morning, Eleanor gave birth to a boy.\n\nNapoleon, who was fighting in Poland at that time, having received a message about this from Marshal Francois-Joseph Lefebvre, was filled with\n\njoyfully exclaimed: “Finally I have a son!”\n\nAt first he decided to adopt a child, but soon changed his mind - the emperor needed a legitimate heir ...\n\nThe boy was named Charles, Count of Leon, and given to the upbringing of Madame Loire, the former nurse of Ashille, the son of Caroline and Murat.\n\nHe was given an annual maintenance of 30,000 francs, which is about 1 million dollars in modern prices.\n\nHis mother was not forgotten either: Eleanor received 22,000 francs a year.\n\nThe birth of a son led Napoleon to the decision to part with Josephine, who was unable to give him an heir ...\n\nTo Eleanor, Napoleon also cooled after the birth of his son, after which, on February 4, 1808, she married the young lieutenant Pierre-Philippe Ogier. Her family life with Ogier was short-lived - in 1812 he went missing while crossing the remnants of the French army across the Berezina River in Russia ...\n\nIn 1814, Eleanor successfully entered into a new marriage with a Bavarian army major, Count Karl-August-Emil von Luxburg, with whom she lived comfortably for thirty-five years - first in Mannheim, and then in Paris, where the count was appointed ambassador.\n\nNapoleon spoiled the young Charles, he was often brought to the Tuileries to his father, who loved to play with him and gave him expensive gifts. Baron Mathieu de Moviera, father-in-law of Napoleon's personal secretary Claude-Francois de Meneval, was appointed guardian of Charles.\n\nAfter the Battle of Waterloo, when the Bonapartes from the august family became just private individuals, Napoleon's mother Letizia and his uncle, Cardinal Joseph Fesch, took up the education of Charles.\n\nCount Leon was like two drops of water like his father in childhood and from early childhood showed a violent and obstinate temper.\n\nIn the will that Napoleon wrote on the island of Saint Helena, Charles was allocated 300,000 francs with the wish that he become a magistrate. However, Count Leon was not interested in a quiet life and, having reached adulthood, he began to lead a wild and disorderly lifestyle.\n\nHaving started his studies at the University of Heidelberg, Charles quickly abandoned it, after which he tried to carry out a variety of projects one after another, up to the construction of a submarine.\n\nHe entered military service as the commander of a battalion of the National Guard of Saint-Denis, but he was soon dismissed \"for negligent attitude to official duties.\"\n\nCharles even tried to become a priest, but did not finish his studies.\n\nAn excellent rider and great horse lover, he could shell out a fortune for a good horse.\n\nThe count was also a passionate gambler. Once, in one night, he lost 45,000 francs (in modern money - about a million and a quarter euros).\n\nTurning into an inveterate duelist, Count Leon in 1832 killed in a duel in the Bois de Vincennes due to a quarrel at the card table, Karl Hesse, the illegitimate offspring of one of the English princes, cousin of the future Queen Victoria, adjutant of the Duke of Wellington.\n\nNaturally, with such squandering, the money left by Emperor Napoleon could not be enough for a long time. Easily parting with money, Charles also easily got into debt when there was a shortage of them ...\n\nIn 1838 he was imprisoned for debts, but not for long.\n\nIn 1840, Charles decided to try his luck in England, where at that time his wealthy relative, Prince Charles-Louis-Napoleon Bonaparte, Napoleon's nephew and grandson of Josephine de Beauharnais, lived in exile. Having thought of nothing else, the count began to extract money from his cousin, and all this happened in such an impudent form that it came to a duel, which, fortunately for both duelists, did not take place ...\n\nThe seconds of Charles-Louis-Napoleon brought two swords to the place of the duel in Wimbledon, and the seconds of Count Leon brought two pistols. A long dispute about which weapon to choose ended with the appearance of the police, who separated the unfortunate duelists.\n\nCount Leon was expelled to France, where he successfully sued his mother, Countess von Luxburg, who was ordered by the court to pay him an annual allowance of 4,000 francs.\n\nWriting bilious and unfriendly pamphlets also began to bring good fees, but he immediately squandered them ...\n\nIn the late 1840s, Charles had the opportunity to try himself as a politician. In those years when the struggle for independence from Austria and unification was going on on the Apennine Peninsula, many hoped that Pope Pius IX would help the Italian states to unite.\n\nCount Leon wrote to the pope and offered himself as the Italian king, however, most likely, no one but Leon himself could imagine him in this role ...\n\nHaving failed in Italy, Count Leon decided to take French affairs seriously. And now, after the exile of the king Louis Philippe in March 1848, Charles solemnly promised to preserve the French Republic, speaking out against all monarchists, including the Bonapartists, who wanted to enthrone his cousin Charles-Louis-Napoleon.\n\nWhen, nevertheless, Charles-Louis-Napoleon became Emperor Napoleon III, Count Leon began to seek his appointment to the public service and the payment of his debts, but his cousin, offended by the Wimbledon duel, did not give the position ...\n\nInstead of a position, a compassionate relative provided Charles with a pension of 6,000 francs and allocated 255,000 francs, of which 45,000 went to pay off the count's debts, and the remainder provided an annual income of 10,000 francs.\n\nBut this money was soon lost and squandered, and Count Leon again turned to the emperor for help.\n\nOld age was inexorably approaching, funds became scarce, and the old reveler settled down somewhat. He reconciled with his mother, with whom he had been at enmity for so long, and in 1862 he married a woman with whom he had already lived for nine years and who bore him six children.\n\nHis wife, Francoise Jaunet, was 25 years younger than him and immeasurably lower than his position - her father had once served as a gardener for Count Leon - but she remained faithful to her husband.\n\nAfter the overthrow of Napoleon III, the first-born of the great emperor was completely ruined, poverty set in.\n\nCount Leon died in Pontoise on April 14, 1881 at the age of 75 and was buried at the expense of the municipality as a beggar vagabond ...\n\nLet's move on to the fate of the second illegitimate son Emperor Napoleon Bonaparte Alexander Walevsky.\n\nIn 1807, in Warsaw, Napoleon met Maria Walewska. There is an opinion that initially Valevskaya succumbed to the courtship of the emperor out of patriotic feelings: the gentry hoped that a love affair with a Polish woman would make Napoleon think more about the interests of her homeland.\n\nHowever, soon a twenty-year-old girl, not out of love given by her parents to the elderly aristocrat Anastasia Colonna-Valevsky, herself fell in love with Napoleon without memory.\n\nAt the beginning of 1808, Maria Valevskaya moved to Paris, moved into an apartment on Victory Street, not far from the apartment in which Eleanor Denuel de la Plaigne, already familiar to us, lived, who at that time had already received her resignation ...\n\nIn 1809, Maria in love follows Napoleon to Austria, where she is in Schönbrunn and announces to him that she is expecting a child from him ...\n\nOn May 4, 1810, in Poland, Walewska gave birth to a boy, who was named Alexander.\n\nSix months later, with her son in her arms, she returned to Paris, but the place next to Napoleon was already taken by another woman - Princess Marie-Louise of Austria ...\n\nNapoleon allocated 10,000 francs a month for the maintenance of his son Alexander, a huge sum in those days.\n\nAt the same time, his romance with Maria Walewska was finally interrupted - largely due to the jealousy of his new legal spouse. The Countess quietly left for Warsaw, but remained faithful to her former lover for a long time...\n\nAfter the deposed Napoleon was exiled to the island of Elba, Walewska secretly visited him there with four-year-old Alexander, but the emperor met his “Polish wife” rather dryly, who was ready to voluntarily share exile with him.\n\nAnd only after Napoleon was exiled to the island of St. Helena, Maria Walewska considered herself free from obligations towards him.\n\nIn September 1816, in Brussels, she married Philippe-Antoine d'Ornano, a former colonel of the Napoleonic guards, but the birth of a child on June 9, 1817, who was named Rodolphe-Auguste-Louis-Eugene, became fatal for her.\n\nSeriously ill, the delightful Polish woman died on December 11 at the age of only 31…\n\nAfter the death of his mother, Alexander-Florian-Joseph Colonna-Walewski, the second son of Napoleon, was brought by his uncle Theodor Marcin Lonchinsky to Poland.\n\nHe was educated in Geneva in 1820-1824.\n\nAt the age of 14, he turned down an offer from Grand Duke Konstantin to become his personal adjutant, and he was followed by the Russian police, for which he fled to France in 1827.\n\nIn December 1830, the Minister of Foreign Affairs, Count Horace de Sebastiani, entrusted Alexander with a secret mission in Poland - so the son of Napoleon was among the participants in the Polish uprising of 1830-1831.\n\nOn February 13, 1831, Alexander Valevsky, with the rank of captain, as an adjutant to the commander, takes part in the famous battle of Grochov, in which the Russian army under the command of Field Marshal Ivan Dibich and the Polish army under the command of Prince Radziwill opposed.\n\nIn this historic battle, both sides suffered colossal losses, but the Poles considered themselves victorious, because the Russian troops did not dare to storm the Polish capital and retreated.\n\nFor active participation in this battle, Alexander Walevsky received a military cross, after which he was sent by the Polish rebel government to London to negotiate the future of Poland.\n\nAfter the defeat of the Polish uprising, Alexander Walevsky returned to Paris, where, as the son of Napoleon, he met a very gracious reception and was enlisted as a captain in the French army.\n\nAfter retiring in 1837, Alexander became a publicist and playwright: he wrote a number of pamphlets (\"Speech on the Algerian Question\", \"English Alliance\" and others), as well as one five-act comedy.\n\nAt the same time, he began to carry out various important diplomatic missions for influential members of the government of Guizot and Thiers in many countries, including Egypt and Argentina.\n\nWhen Alexander Walevsky returned from Buenos Aires, the French Revolution of 1848 broke out and, in contrast to his brother Count Leon, he immediately joined Charles-Louis-Napoleon, the future Emperor Napoleon III.\n\nHe was appointed envoy of France by a distinguished relative, initially to Florence, then to Naples, and finally to London, where Alexander was so flexible in his dealings that he succeeded in obtaining the recognition of the Second Empire by the English, despite all the horror that the name aroused in them. Napoleon.\n\nIt was Alexander Valevsky who organized the visit of Emperor Napoleon III to England and Queen Victoria to France, and also ensured cooperation between the two powers in the Crimean War.\n\nAs a reward for this success, in May 1855, Alexander was appointed Minister of Foreign Affairs of France and had the pleasure of presiding over the Congress of Paris in 1856, where Russia, which he hated, was humiliated ...\n\nDuring the negotiations, he became a Knight Grand Cross of the Legion of Honor.\n\nSubsequently, in 1868, Alexander Walevsky was elected president of the Legislative Corps and a member of the Academy of Fine Arts. However, the count's health was undermined, and on September 27, 1868, at the zenith of his fame, he died ...\n\nHad seven children.\n\nHis wife Maria Anna di Ricci, daughter of the Italian Count Zanobio di Ricci and great-niece last king Poland Stanislaw August Poniatowski, bore him four children, including the son of Charles-Zanobi-Rodolphe, who became a lieutenant colonel and died in 1916 in the First World War, fighting for France.\n\nHowever, the most beloved son of Alexander Walevsky was Alexander-Antoine, whom the actress Rachel Felix gave birth to. His father not only recognized him, but also left him the title of count as an inheritance.\n\nThe current Count Colonna-Walevsky, born in 1934, is the great-grandson of Alexandre-Antoine.\n\nSo, let's move on to the youngest son of Emperor Napoleon - Napoleon-Francois-Joseph or Napoleon II.\n\nImmediately after the divorce from Josephine, Napoleon began choosing a new wife, who was supposed to give birth to a legitimate heir to the throne.\n\nOn January 28, 1810, a special meeting of the highest dignitaries of the empire was convened on this issue. As a result, it was decided that a new marriage alliance was to guarantee the Napoleonic dynasty a place in the sun, and, therefore, it had to be concluded with a great power.\n\nIn addition to France, there were three such states in the world at that time: England, Russia and Austria.\n\nHowever, based on the fact that with England there was an incessant war not for life, but for death, then the choice remained between Russia and Austria.\n\nMost of the ministers were in favor of the candidacy of the Russian Grand Duchess Anna Pavlovna, who was the sister of Emperor Alexander I, and only a few, including Foreign Minister Charles-Maurice de Talleyrand-Périgord, for the Austrian Archduchess Marie-Louise, daughter of Emperor Franz I.\n\nHowever, the Russian emperor Alexander I did not want to marry his sister to a “Corsican” and came up with more and more excuses: young age, different religions, and, finally, the fact that only her mother could marry her, and he did not have such power.\n\nIrritated by the intrigues of the Russian court, Napoleon declared that he was leaning towards the \"Austrian version.\"\n\nAnd so, at the beginning of February 1810, a marriage contract was prepared, which was completely copied from a similar contract drawn up at the marriage of the French king Louis XVI to another Austrian archduchess, Marie Antoinette, the aunt of Napoleon's bride.\n\nThe Austrian emperor ratified the treaty, and on February 21, 1810, a message about this arrived in Paris.\n\nOn February 22, 1810, Marshal Louis-Alexandre Berthier, Napoleon's chief of staff, was sent to Vienna to represent the Emperor of the French during the solemn marriage ceremony.\n\nOn March 11, 1810, a traditional marriage by proxy was concluded in Vienna - in the presence of the entire Austrian imperial family, the entire court, the entire diplomatic corps, dignitaries and generals.\n\nThe next day, Bertier went back to France, and 24 hours later, the future Empress Marie-Louise, whom Napoleon met on March 27, 1810, near Paris, left Vienna.\n\nRemarkably, only here the couple saw each other for the first time in their lives. Napoleon's goal was to find such a wife,\n\nwho could bear him an heir, so he was not very worried about appearance and feelings. However, in the carriage he found a delightful, childishly naive young woman and immediately fell in love with her.\n\nOn April 2, 1810, the wedding of Napoleon and Marie Louise was celebrated again at the Tuileries Palace.\n\nOn March 20, 1811, Marie Louise gave birth to a boy, who was named Napoleon-Francois-Joseph and immediately after birth was proclaimed King of Rome and heir to the empire.\n\nIt seems that a great fate awaited this legitimate son of Emperor Napoleon, but fortune decreed otherwise ...\n\nIn early April 1814, Napoleon abdicated - in favor of Napoleon-Francois-Joseph, who was proclaimed emperor of the French, but was never crowned: the victorious Russian emperor Alexander I not without the assistance of the ubiquitous Talleyrand, he insisted on returning to the throne of the Bourbons.\n\nThe four-year-old son of Napoleon left with his mother to visit relatives in Vienna. It was decided to isolate Marie Louise and her son from Napoleon as well as from each other.\n\nThe former Empress Marie-Louise, who received the Duchy of Parma in exchange for her former possessions, was accompanied everywhere by the Austrian officer Adam-Adalbert von Neipperg.\n\nThis Austrian officer was about forty years old, he had an extremely attractive appearance, except, of course, for a wide black bandage that hid an empty eye socket.\n\nHe was ordered by the Austrian emperor to spy on Marie-Louise and prevent any contact with the exiled emperor.\n\nHowever, despite the service, the spy soon became a lover, and in 1821 the husband of the Duchess of Parma.\n\nMarie-Louise never saw Napoleon again, and gave birth to four children to her new husband.\n\nShe lived the rest of her life in Parma, where she acquired a private court and countless favorites.\n\nWidowed in 1829 for the second time, on February 17, 1834, she married again - to her chamberlain, Count Charles-Rene de Bombelle.\n\nDuring the reign of Marie Louise, schools, bridges, hospitals were built in Parma, and the construction of a theater began, which the inhabitants of the city are still proud of.\n\nThus, Marie Louise remained the most beloved ruler of the small duchy ...\n\nNapoleon-Francois-Joseph, the dream and hope of all the Bonapartists of the world, lived near Vienna in Schönbrunn Castle, and he was guarded as carefully as sometimes even the most dangerous criminals are not guarded - everyone perfectly understood that the name of Napoleon II alone, under certain circumstances, could serve as a banner for the Bonapartist movement.\n\nHe was forced to practically forget the French language and speak only German, and everyone called him exclusively “in Austrian” - Franz.\n\nIn 1818, Napoleon's son was given the title of Duke of Reichstadt.\n\nFrom the age of 12, the Duke of Reichstadt was considered to be military service and by 1830 he had risen to the rank of major.\n\nThey say that, while living at the court of his grandfather, the young man, in spite of everything, remembered his great father, was his ardent admirer and was burdened by the Schönbrunn orders.\n\nUnfortunately, his life was short-lived - he died of tuberculosis on July 22, 1832.\n\nIn fairness, it must be said that there were rumors that he was poisoned.\n\nThis young man went down in history under the dynastic name of Napoleon II, given to him by the Bonapartists. In fact, he never reigned, although from June 22, 1815 (that is, after the second abdication of Napoleon) in Paris for several weeks, it was he who was recognized as emperor.\n\nUnder the repressive regime of the Bourbons, it was not safe to speak aloud about Napoleon, so everyone sang eagles - the eagle was the heraldic symbol of the French emperor.\n\nAnd his son, whom it was also not recommended to talk about, became Eaglet. This nickname was glorified by Edmond Rostand, who wrote the drama \"Eaglet\" in 1900 - about the sad life of Napoleon II, who lives in a golden German cage.\n\nNapoleon II was buried in the famous Viennese Kapuzinerkirche next to the other Habsburgs.\n\nIn December 1940, at the direction of Adolf Hitler, Napoleon II rested in the Cathedral of the Les Invalides, next to the tomb of his father, whose ashes were transferred here exactly one hundred years before.\n\nSo the crowned father and his unfortunate son finally met.\n\nSources of information:\n\n1.

He is the only legitimate child and heir of Emperor Napoleon, who went down in history under the nickname \"Eaglet\" (L'Aiglon).\n\nThomas Lawrence. Napoleon II as a child\n\nNapoleon's marriage to Josephine was childless. Legally, this was not a problem, since the constitution of the twelfth year allowed the emperor to adopt the children and grandchildren of his brothers. The problem was purely human: Napoleon wanted to transfer the crown to his own son, especially since he was convinced of his ability to have offspring - from love affair illegitimate children were born with noble ladies Eleanor Denuel de la Plaigne and Countess Maria Walewska. From Eleanor - the son of Leon, and from the Countess Maria - the son of Alexander-Florian-Joseph-Colon. Napoleon decided to divorce Josephine, with whom he entered into a church marriage on the eve of the coronation. It was not difficult to get permission from the Pope for a divorce. But with the choice of the bride there were difficulties.\n\nIt was about the conclusion. dynastic marriage, which would not only give an heir, but also related Bonaparte with the legitimate monarchs of Europe. First of all, Napoleon proposed to the sisters of the Russian Emperor Alexander I, Ekaterina Pavlovna and Anna Pavlovna, but was refused.\n\nThen he asked for the hand of Marie-Louise, the daughter of the Austrian Emperor Franz I, who, worried about the legacy of the Habsburgs, agreed.\n\nPauline Jean Baptiste Guerin. Portrait of Empress Marie-Louise\n\nOn April 2, 1810, the wedding of Napoleon I with the Archduchess of Austria Marie-Louise, who was the great-niece of the executed French Queen Marie Antoinette, took place in the Louvre. A year later, on March 20, 1811, their son Napoleon-Francois-Joseph-Charles was born, who received the title of King of Rome.\n\nFrancois Gerard. Empress Marie-Louise with her son, the Roman King\n\nThe new married life really fascinated Napoleon, who even for some time weakened his attention to state affairs. He was crazy about his son-heir. He was worried about his young wife, as perhaps none of the women since the affair with Josephine. It inspired pride that the arrogant descendants of the Roman emperors intermarried with him.\n\nPierre-Paul Proudhon. Roman king\n\nPolitically, the marriage of Napoleon I to Marie-Louise was the culmination of the Bonapartist epic. From that time on, a period of difficulties and defeats began for the empire. The economic crisis of 1810-1811, the military catastrophe of 1812, and finally, the abdication on April 5, 1814 amid general apathy and treason - these are only the main milestones of its decline and collapse. The emperor abdicated in favor of his son, but the winners declared the Bonapartes deposed.\n\nUnder the terms of the agreement on April 11, concluded between France and the allies in Fontainebleau, Napoleon I was given sovereign possession of the island of Elba and was assigned maintenance in the amount of 2 million francs. Other members of the Bonaparte family were not forgotten - they all received generous annuities. As for the Empress and the Roman King, they were separated from Napoleon through the efforts of Austrian diplomacy. According to the agreement on April 11, the Duchy of Parma was assigned to them.\n\nOn April 20, the heartbreaking farewell of Napoleon I to the guards took place in the courtyard of Fontainebleau. In a very despondent mood, he went into exile. Three days later, Marie-Louise and her son set off for Vienna. While on the road, a lively correspondence began between the spouses, in which they expressed touching concern for each other. But as soon as Napoleon, already upon his arrival at Elba, demanded the arrival of his wife, she answered with a firm refusal, referring to her duty as a mother and representative of the Habsburg family.\n\nGustave Bettinger. Napoleon contemplating a portrait of the Roman king during his exile on the Elbe\n\nPerhaps the reason for the quarrel was the arrival of Maria Walewska on Elba. It is possible that Marie Louise herself gave her a reason: by this time she was seized by an affair with Count Nayperg, the chief minister of the Duchy of Parma. Nevertheless, Napoleon continued to bombard her with letters, and during the Hundred Days he waited in vain for her return with her son to Paris.\n\nThe triumphal \"flight of the eagle\" through France in March 1815 shocked contemporaries. The emperor, cast into dust, rose in the blink of an eye and again found himself at the head of a half-million army, ready to fight the enemy. In some ways, it was already a different person - tired, broken. The defeats of 1812-1814, the betrayal of close people and associates in 1814, the tragedy of renunciation were not in vain.\n\nThe defeat at the Battle of Waterloo on June 18, 1815 put an end to the power of Napoleon I. There followed a second abdication in favor of the son, which did not find support, although the Paris legislature, although from June 22 to July 7, 1815, recognized the child as emperor, surrender to the British and exile, now to the distant island of St. Helena. There he died on May 5, 1821.\n\nOn the occasion of the death of Napoleon I, three months of mourning was declared in Parma. On August 8, 1821, Marie Louise secretly married Count Adam Adalbert Niperg, by whom she had two children by that time.\n\nCount Adam Adalbert Naiperg\n\nIt would be an exaggeration to think that, absorbed in the joys and cares of a new marriage, the mother abandoned her first child, but the eldest son needed much more attention than other children. To the usual psychological difficulties of a child who grew up without a father, political ones were added, for from a very tender age, Napoleon's son became the object of intrigue and speculation.\n\nThe Vienna court did not like his first name - Napoleon. They began to call him by his middle name, but in a German way - Franz. The Congress of Vienna deprived him of hereditary rights to the Duchy of Parma. Only in compensation did Austria grant him the title of Duke of Reichstadt, after the name of one of the estates in Bohemia. In addition, he was relentlessly followed by fanatical Bonapartists, for whom he remained the legitimate heir to the imperial crown. Napoleon II.\n\nJean-Baptiste Isabey. Portrait of the Roman King, Napoleon II\n\nTherefore, members of the Austrian government did not take their eyes off him, and so that Parma would not become a Bonapartist mecca, he was separated from his mother. All this fuss, of course, was incomprehensible to a child who, moreover, was brought up as an Austrian prince. But the ambiguity of his position at court - as a member of the House of Habsburg and at the same time a prisoner - became apparent over time.\n\nFranz finally had his sight when he was allowed to use the rich library of the imperial court, in which he discovered books about his father.\n\nMoritz Daffinger. Franz, Duke of Reichstadt\n\nAn inquisitive teenager, fascinated by military history, gradually turned into a brilliant young man who dreamed of a military career, which caused concern to foreign governments and even the all-powerful Chancellor Metternich. In 1828, he received as a gift from his grandfather - the Austrian emperor - the rank of captain of the Jaeger regiment, and he met his 20th birthday already in the rank of lieutenant colonel.\n\nThe revolution of 1830 stirred up the Austrian court and the whole of monarchical Europe. Franz was again looked at as a likely contender for the French imperial crown. But neither the fears nor the hopes that Franz could inspire were destined to be fulfilled. In the middle of 1831, he developed pulmonary tuberculosis, and a year later, on July 22, 1832, the Roman King Napoleon II, Prince of Parma, Duke of Reichstadt, died in Schönbrunn Palace.\n\nCircumstances did not allow \"Eaglet\" to spread its wings. He entered the history of French dynasties as one of the most mysterious and romantic figures.\n\nMarie-Louise, after the death of Count Naiperg in 1829, married for the third time. And again, her chosen one was the first minister of the Duchy of Parma, Count de Bombel, appointed to this position by the Austrian government. After several years of unremarkable life, in December 1847, Marie-Louise died, like Franz, of tuberculosis. Having become a widow, the Comte de Bombel was tonsured and became Bishop of Amiens.\n\nBut the posthumous fate of \"Eaglet\" is also interesting.\n\nHis cousin Prince Louis Napoleon, having proclaimed himself emperor in 1852, took the name Napoleon III; thus, he considered, after the fact, Napoleon II as the head of the dynasty in 1821-1832, and himself as his heir.\n\nIn 1940, on the orders of Adolf Hitler, the remains of the Duke of Reichstadt were transferred from occupied Paris and buried in Les Invalides next to the tomb of his father. At the same time, the heart of the deceased, kept, according to the then custom, separately, remained in Vienna. This happened exactly 100 years after the ashes of Napoleon himself were transferred to the Les Invalides.\n\nThe fate of Napoleon II inspired Edmond Rostand to the drama L'Aiglon. Through this work, Marina Tsvetaeva became a fan of the personality of both Napoleons - father and son. She even experienced some peculiar love for \"Eaglet\", reflected in the poems:\n\nIN SCHONBRUNN\n\nGentle is the first breath of spring,\n\nThe night is warm, quiet and moonlit.\n\nMore tears, more dreams\n\nIn the gloomy Schönbrunn castle.\n\nSomeone's white silhouette\n\nAbove the table drooped lower.\n\nSigh again, delirium again:\n\n\"Marseillaise! Throne!.. In Paris...\"\n\nLetters rushed from the pages\n\nLine - regiment. Trumpets sang...\n\nDrops fall from eyelashes\n\n\"I'm with you again!\" whisper lips.\n\nLamps dim half light\n\nIt fades, but the night is brighter.\n\nWhose there is a formidable silhouette\n\nGrew up in the depths of the alley?\n\nPrince of Austria? It's a role!\n\nDuke? Dream! Is it winter in Schönbrunn?\n\nNo, he's a little king!\n\n- \"Emperor, beloved son!\n\nRushing! The chains are far away\n\nWe are free. There is no captivity.\n\nDo you see the lights, honey?\n\nDo you hear splashes? It's the Seine!\"\n\nHow wide is the father's cloak!\n\nThe horse flies, enveloped in fire.\n\n\"What rumbles there, between the thickets?\n\nSea, or what?\" - \"Son, - soldiers!\"\n\n- \"Oh, father! How you burn!\n\nLook, and there to the right, -\n\nIs this heaven?\" - \"My son is Paris!\"\n\n- \"And bent over him?\" - \"Glory\".\n\nIn the glare of the Tuileries,\n\nBanners are flying.\n\n- \"You suffered! Now the kings!\n\nHello son of Napoleon!\n\nDrums, sounds of strings,\n\nAll in flowers.. Children rejoice...\n\nEverything is calm. Sleeping Schönbrunn.\n\nSomeone is crying in the moonlight.\n\nKNOCK ON THE DOOR\n\nThe heart is dormant, but the heart is so sensitive\n\nHe remembers everything: both bliss and pain.\n\nHave those rays burned out long ago?\n\nHow to forget you, sad little one,\n\nBlue-eyed little king?\n\nYou, as before, wander through the alley,\n\nUncompromising, arrogant and wild;\n\nOn the curls - a golden highlight ...\n\nI am silent, I embarrassedly do not dare\n\nLook into your fading face.\n\nI am one of those, oh my woeful boy,\n\nThat from birth not here and not there.\n\nOh, heed the belated pleas!\n\nWhy are you smiling finger\n\nDid you put it gently on your lips?\n\nThe step beckoned to infinity,\n\nBut, alas, the step deceived:\n\nInfinity ended in a day!\n\nI cheated on you for a shadow\n\nChanged the shadow for me shadow.\n\nPARTING\n\nYour horse, as before, gallops like a whirlwind\n\nLate in the park...\n\nBut there is a shadow in the heart, and the heart is crying,\n\nMy prince, my boy, my hero.\n\nOf the son of God these verses are:\n\nHe is eternally bright, eternally young,\n\nI bought immortality by the day of Golgotha,\n\nYour Golgotha ​​was Schönbrunn.\n\nSounded to me the call of God\n\nYour christening bells...\n\nI gave you so much!\n\nI gave too much!\n\nNow my spirit is almost calm\n\nDon't piss him off...\n\nFarewell, longingly slain warrior,\n\nWounded eaglet, goodbye!\n\nYou were my nonsense, light and unwise,\n\nYou are a dream that will never happen again...\n\nFarewell, my fair-haired duke,\n\nMy great love!\n\nWe all know the sad fate of Napoleon from the time of history lessons. But people usually know little or nothing about his family. And in vain.\n\nRepresentatives of the Corsican Bonaparte clan managed to live in Russia, suppress unrest in the Caucasus, found the FBI, save Freud from Hitler, and even inspire Antoine de Saint-Exupery to write The Little Prince.\n\nSons of the Iron Signora\n\nNapoleon Bonaparte is actually Napoleone Buonaparte. Or just Nabullo for those closest to you. Not the most charismatic name in the world, we agree. Especially for the French ear. The Bonapartes seemed to the French \"come in large numbers\": they lived in Corsica, where they came from Italy.\n\nNapoleon's mother Letitia Bonaparte was \"beautiful as day\", and in terms of strength of character she was not inferior to Daenerys Stormborn. She was known as a rebel and an iron lady (well, not a lady, but a signora): already being pregnant with Nabullo, Letizia climbed the Corsican rocks with a dagger in her hands and participated in the uprising for independence from France led by Pascal Paoli.\n\nBut the uprising was crushed, so Letizia had to go to take care of children - practically the only purpose of a woman at the end of the 18th century. She had a hard time: her husband, lawyer Carlo Buonaparte, betrayed Pascal Paoli and at the last moment defected to the side of the French. For Letitia, France was a real evil empire. Like Mordor.\n\nSo when Napoleon and his older brother Joseph sailed off to study on the Continent, she hardly liked it. Letizia never believed that Napoleon—and even more so his brother, the weak-willed Joseph—would be of any use. All her hopes are for her third son, the ambitious and charming Lucien.\n\nLucien fiercely competed with Napoleon. In their youth, they both dreamed of becoming writers. Napoleon even wrote one sentimental novel, Clisson and Eugenia, in which main character on almost every page she sheds a mean male tear and suffers from unrequited love. Lucien surpassed his brother and published not one, but several novels about Indians, \"good savages\" and beautiful maidens. And he did not limit himself to graphomania, being prolific in Corsican style: he had eleven children from two wives.\n\nEmperor's Children\n\nNapoleon had three children. The first-born - Charles Leon Denuel was born from the lecturer of the sister of the future emperor, Caroline. The guy failed. He played cards, drank, went for walks and was not distinguished by special talents. Leon did not know how to save at all and once spent 45 thousand francs in one night. Napoleon's firstborn died a poor and forgotten old man at the age of 75. He had no wife, no children. Leon's funeral was paid for by the Parisian municipality.\n\nThe second son, just like in fairy tales, \"was a smart kid.\" Alexander Florian Józef Colonna Walewski, Napoleon's son by the Polish aristocrat Maria Walewska, unlike Leon, hardly knew his father. Bastard was born a month after Napoleon's marriage to his second wife, Princess Marie-Louise of Austria. When Alexander was 14, he proudly turned down an offer from Grand Duke Konstantin Romanov to become his personal aide-de-camp.\n\nFreud was a Jew, and there was no place for him in the world of the Third Reich. When famous psychoanalyst was in mortal danger, Maria saved him and part of his family: she helped to leave Austria occupied by Hitler. The French film \"Princess Marie\" is dedicated to the relationship between the student and the teacher. The role of the French intellectual princess was played by Catherine Deneuve.\n\nCharles Joseph: founding the FBI and supporting the lynching\n\nThe descendants of the rebellious Leticia were able to successfully realize themselves not only in Europe, but also in the USA. Napoleon Bonaparte's great-nephew Charles Joseph was Secretary of the Navy under Roosevelt. He was an intellectual (graduated from Harvard) and a very insightful person.\n\nIt was he who came up with the idea found The Bureau of Investigation, which we now know as the FBI. The new organization initially had only 34 agents.\n\nThe Americans did not like Charles Joseph, just as we do not like most officials, and they called him \"Free Soup\". One day he inadvertently noticed that between free public education and free soup in the canteen makes no difference. Charles Joseph was also nicknamed the Peacock for his swaying gait.\n\nA distant relative of the great Napoleon did not find anything wrong with the practice of lynching and sincerely did not understand why few people supported him.\n\nWhat now?\n\nNow in the world live approximately Bonapartes. One of the most notable is Charles Napoleon (again) Bonaparte, another descendant of Jerome. Charles Napoleon became a doctor of economic sciences and a financier, at one time he served as vice-mayor of the Corsican city of Ajaccio, the historical homeland of the family. He is passionate about family history and some time ago published the book \"Unknown Napoleon - my ancestor.\" But comparisons with Napoleon I are more than cool:"
