Most of the homes built prior to World War II were used as summer cabins. In 1925 San Geronimo had 20 families that “swelled to 30” in the summer. After the opening of the Golden Gate Bridge, offering easier access to Marin County, and with the coming of World War II, when Sausalito shipyard workers needed housing, many summer cabins became permanent residences.\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lagunitas-Forest_Knolls,_California\n\nhttp://sgvpg.org/planning-resources/sg-valley-historical-information/\n\nSettlement and Development\n\nRafael Cacho, a military ­officer and friend of General Mariano Vallejo, was the first person to hold title to the San Geronimo Valley. On February 12, 1844, he was granted the 8,800 acre Rancho Cañada de San Geronimo (The Valley of Saint Jerome) by the Mexican government, in acknowledgment of his loyal service as a Mexican citizen. Cacho lived in the Valley with his wife and children, grazing cattle and horses, until his finances forced a sale in 1846 to Lieutenant Joseph Revere, who purchased the rancho for $1,000 and an interest in a very small ranch in Napa. Revere, a naval officer and grandson of Paul Revere, had served under General Vallejo, and had released the beleaguered general from imprisonment at Sutter’s Fort. Revere had discovered the Valley while hunting elk, and immediately determined to make it his own. He wrote:\n\nThe Canada of San Geronimo is one of the loveliest valleys in California, shut in by lofty hills, the sides of which are covered with redwood forests, and pines of several kinds, and interspersed with many flowering trees and shrubs peculiar to the Country. Through it flows a copious stream, fed by the mountain brooks; and the soil in the bottomlands is so prolific, that a hundred bushels of wheat to the acre can be raised with the rudest cultivation and other crops in corresponding abundance.\n\nJoseph Revere retained ownership of Rancho San Geronimo for only four years, and then sold it to Rodman Price for $7,500. Price returned to New Jersey, where he was elected Governor, and hired Lorenzo White, a 49er gold miner, to manage Price’s cattle operation on the rancho. For many years the rancho was known as White’s Valley, and White’s Hill still bears his name. Title to Rancho San Geronimo was then sold several times, finally, in 1854, to Adolph Mailliard, whose father was Louis Mailliard, “natural son” of Joseph Bonaparte, King of Spain and Naples, and elder brother of the infamous Napoleon Bonaparte. After the family’s exile from Spain, Louis Mailliard retrieved from Switzerland a strongbox filled with the family’s jewels, and brought the treasure to their new home in New Jersey. Adolph Mailliard purchased the rancho, to celebrate the birth of his son, Joseph, for $50,000, a mighty sum considering it was purchased a mere eight years earlier for $1000.\n\nAdolph Mailliard and his wife, Annie, set out to establish a grand estate, building their home of 18 rooms and 11 fireplaces near Castle Rock, in today’s Woodacre. Annie’s aunt described it as “an unremarkable house with a deep veranda all around and small rooms with high ceilings.” Her sisters pitied her isolation, and visitors from the East “were to wonder how Annie could put up with straw matting on her floors, awkward servants and austere furniture, but she did.” In fact, Annie loved her house and her Valley, and refused to ever leave. Annie’s sister, Julia Ward Howe, author of “The Battle Hymn of the Republic” and an active abolitionist and suffragette, would often enjoy relaxing at the Mailliard’s home in the Valley during her travels.\n\nEarly in the second half of the nineteenth century Adolph Mailliard transferred title to tracts of 400-600 acres each to James and Thomas Roy in San Geronimo, and to James Dickson and Calvin Dickson in Woodacre. Little other division of the rancho occurred through the end of the century.\n\nIn 1895 Annie Mailliard died of breast cancer in the home she loved so dearly. Her husband died a year later. Their home became the clubhouse of the Woodacre Improvement Club in 1924. The building burned in 1958 and was replaced, where it continues to serve the Club’s members and the Valley community.\n\nIn 1905 and 1906 the Mailliard heirs subdivided much of Lagunitas, and in 1912 they sold their remaining interest in San Geronimo Valley real estate to the Lagunitas Development Company, which subsequently subdivided Forest Knolls, San Geronimo, and Woodacre. Most of the homes built prior to World War II were used as summer cabins. In 1925 San Geronimo had 20 families that “swelled to 30” in the summer. After the opening of the Golden Gate Bridge, offering easier access to Marin County, and with the coming of World War II, when Sausalito shipyard workers needed housing, many summer cabins became permanent ­residences.\n\nFollowing World War II, little changed in the Valley, but in April 1961 the Marin County Board of Supervisors adopted a Master Plan proposal for the Valley that envisioned 20,000 new residents, and 5,000 new homes that would cover the Valley’s northern and southern hillsides, up to and around Kent Lake. The land around Spirit Rock was proposed to be the site for a civic center, fire station, shopping center, heliport, and multifamily residences. A freeway was proposed to come from San Anselmo over White’s Hill and through the center of the Valley, with an interchange that would cross into Nicasio Valley. During the next ten years only the golf course and a few homes adjacent to the golf course, on San Geronimo Valley Drive, were ­developed as elements of that 1961 Master Plan.\n\nDuring the 1960s the Valley became a magnet for “Flower Children” from San Francisco, who set up camps and other unconventional abodes in the hills of San Geronimo Valley, much to the horror of many Valley residents.\n\nIn 1972 a Countywide Plan was proposed for adoption by the Marin County Board of Supervisors, and was adopted in 1973, emphasizing low density and the preservation of open space, rural areas, and agriculture. Also in 1972, Lagunitas resident Jean Berensmeier was informed that growth was a-comin’ to the Valley, based on the 1961 Valley Master Plan. Discovering the 1961 Master Plan, she organized a community meeting to review the Plan and the proposed Countywide Plan. The ad hoc Planning Group was thus born, and worked for five years to create a new Community Plan that met the goals of the 1973 Countywide Plan, preserving the rural character of the Valley. Gone were the 5,000 new homes, the Civic Center, the shopping center, the heliport, and the freeway. Instead, boundaries were set around the four villages so the remaining land could be preserved for its rural character, and for open space and agricultural use, with only a spattering of homes outside the village boundaries. The San Geronimo Valley Community Plan was adopted in January 1978.\n\nWhen Joseph Bonaparte arrived in the United States in August 1815, he was accompanied by four people, including his secretary Louis Mailliard. Mailliard served Joseph faithfully for 36 years and became his closest confidant. In 1817 Joseph sent Mailliard on a hunt for buried treasure in Europe.\n\nFrom Mortefontaine to America\n\nMailliard was not Joseph Bonaparte’s son, although it is sometimes stated that he was. Louis Hypolite Mailliard was born in Mortefontaine, France, on May 22, 1795. In 1798, Joseph bought the château of Mortefontaine, north of Paris. In 1808, Mailliard entered Joseph’s service. He accompanied Joseph when the latter became King of Spain, and stayed with him through the fall of Napoleon’s Empire. In 1815 he fled with Joseph into exile in the United States.\n\nMailliard married Marguerite Angelique Redet, whose father was Master of Horse for Joseph’s wife Julie. At some point Marguerite followed her husband to America. Their son Adolphe was born at Point Breeze, Joseph’s estate in Bordentown, New Jersey, on August 5, 1819. Sadly, Marguerite died 10 days later, leaving Mailliard heartbroken. At age two and a half, Adolphe was sent to France to be raised by his grandfather, who sent him to boarding school and college under the name of “Henri Lustre.” (1)\n\nA Swiss treasure hunt\n\nIn 1817 Joseph sent Louis Mailliard back to Europe to retrieve a cache of diamonds, papers and money he had buried in 1815, with Mailliard’s help, in a foxhole at his Swiss estate of Prangins. The ship on which Mailliard sailed was wrecked in a storm off the coast of Ireland, but the passengers and crew were saved. Mailliard stopped in Brussels, where – as instructed by Joseph – he tried to persuade Joseph’s wife Julie and their daughters to come to America. Julie demurred, saying her physicians told her she could not stand the sea voyage.\n\nMailliard continued on to Switzerland and presented himself to a man named Véret, Joseph’s financial administrator. Just as he assumes a disguise for his mission to Europe in Napoleon in America, Mailliard was disguised as an Englishman, complete with a red wig and a fake accent. This was convincing enough to deceive Véret, who laughed when Mailliard revealed his identity.\n\nThe two agreed that Mailliard should pose as an English speculator who wanted to prospect for coal at Prangins. Véret hired two unsuspecting workmen to help with the digging. Mailliard instructed them to start at some distance from where he knew Joseph’s treasure was buried. Gradually he brought them closer, and finally to the exact spot, where he had them dig only to a certain depth, after which he dismissed them. That night, he returned with Véret to remove the final layer of dirt and uncover the iron box. Back at Véret’s house, they opened the lid and inventoried the contents against a list Mailliard had brought with him. After drying out the parcels, among which were 16 diamonds worth approximately five million francs, they ascertained that nothing was missing. Mailliard returned to Point Breeze with the treasure. (2)\n\nJoseph Bonaparte’s “right hand”\n\nLouis Mailliard stayed with Joseph until the latter’s death in 1844. Joseph clearly thought highly of him. He wrote to Julie:\n\nI cannot do without [Mailliard]; he is my secretary, my intendant; he is my right hand. (3)\n\nMailliard kept a journal, which is held at the Yale University Library in New Haven, Connecticut. There are some extracts in an excellent article by Peter Hicks in Napoleonica. La Revue, entitled “Joseph Bonaparte and the ‘Réunion de Famille’ of 1832-33.” Focusing on Joseph’s return to Europe in 1832 and a family meeting in London in 1833, Hicks reports how Mailliard noted the division between Joseph and his nephew Louis-Napoléon (the future Napoleon III).\n\nWe don’t see the same for our cause in France. That is unfortunate for the cause. (4)\n\nMailliard also made clear that Joseph thought little of his brother Lucien:\n\nLucien is all imagination but without perseverance, changing all the time. (5)\n\nMailliard was the executor of Joseph’s estate. Joseph noted in his will:\n\nI here declare that no man has more right to my confidence and esteem than Mr. Louis Mailliard…. I would like to show my attachment to him by a great legacy: but his modesty equals his fidelity. I know that what I am about to give him will satisfy him. I bequeath, then, to Mr. Louis Mailliard, the farm of Groveville, near the village of the same name, of about 250 acres, more or less, such as it is, and as I bought it…. This farm, situated in America, forms part of the domain that I have designated for the above. I give and bequeath equally to Mr. Louis Mailliard, six thousand dollars in stock of the Union Canal, of Pennsylvania. (6)\n\nJoseph also left Mailliard an annual lifetime income of $400, a gold watch, and a miniature portrait of himself in the uniform of his guard. He left Mailliard’s son, Adolphe, stock in the Union Canal Company and his silver toilet articles.\n\nOnce Louis-Napoléon was on the throne in Paris, Louis Mailliard was instrumental in getting Joseph’s remains returned to France in 1862 (Joseph had specified in his will that he wanted to be interred there). Mailliard retired to Mortefontaine and died in 1872 at the age of 77.\n\nIn 1846, Mailliard’s son Adolphe married Ann Eliza Ward, the sister of Julia Ward Howe, author of “The Battle Hymn of the Republic.” Adolphe died in California in 1890.\n\nYou might also enjoy:\n\nJoseph Bonaparte: From King of Spain to New Jersey\n\nAchille & Joseph Archambault: Napoleon’s grooms on St. Helena\n\nLouis-Joseph Marchand: Napoleon’s valet and friend\n\nRoyal Rosamond Press dedicates this closure to my\n\nchapter ‘Bohemians and Bankers’ to Cipriani, a man who shaped the\n\nWest, and knew the ancestor of Rosamond, the ‘Rose of the World.\n\nJohn Presco\n\nCopyright 2003\n\n“Returning to Paris in October, 1855, he was warmly received\n\nby his friend Prince Napoleon who overwhelmed him with questions\n\nabout his travels in America. “I answered them the best I could.”\n\nCipriani wrote, “But , it is a veritable deluge….We keep talking\n\nabout my journeys, of the Sanora, of conquering it.” Perhaps he\n\nthought of seizing it for France and hoped the prince might persuade\n\nhis cousin the Emperor to finance the undertaking. “It is an idea in\n\nthe air,” he added, “that I would willingly undertake, if necessary\n\ncapital and men were available.”\n\nTo another member of the imperial household, Jerome\n\nBonaparte, ex-king of Westphalia, Cipriani revealed tha the had\n\nconsiderable investments in California and hinted at receiving\n\ninterest of twelve to fifteen percent a month on his money. He also\n\nboasted of his house in Belmont which “out there is considered\n\nmagnificent.”\n\nOn behalf of the Emperor Napoleon 3, he visited King Victor\n\nEmanuel of Sardinia to explore the possibilities of a matrimonial\n\narrangement between the ruling houses as a prelude to a political-\n\nmilitary alliance between France and Sardinia. The conversation\n\neventually turned to Cipriani’s overland journey of 1853, which\n\napparently had not escaped the king’s notice. “I have heard tell,” he\n\nsaid, “of a great journey of yours, with you on horseback and camping\n\nout.”\n\n“For eight solid months, Your Majesty,” Cipriani replied,\n\nmaking certain to include the time he left San Francisco in February\n\nto October, 1853.\n\n“But it is true.” the king continued, “that you led covered\n\nwagons and crossed the Rocky Mountains where there was roads, and\n\ngreat rivers without any bridges.”\n\nThe above is from the ‘California and Overland Diaries of\n\nCount Leonetto Cipriani’. a journey that may constitute the first\n\ncattle drive. What this diary reveals is France’s plan to conquer\n\nMexico, and perhaps the Western United States.\n\n“Cipriani must have followed with close interest the\n\nactivities of Count Raousset-Boulbon and other French filibusters in\n\nthe Sonora province of Mexico. The French consul in San Francisco, in\n\ndifficulty with the American government for his alleged support of\n\nsuch filibustering activity, wrote to the Sardinian Ministry of\n\nForeign Affairs in 1854 that he was grateful (moral) support he was\n\nreceiving from Colonel Cipriani. That Cirpiani had entertained some\n\nsuch expedition in the Sonora is clear from his memoirs though there\n\nis no evidence of any actual participation.”\n\nWith the ‘Gold Rush’ came foreigners who sought to fulfill\n\nthe manifest destiny of their nations who now feared the growing\n\nrichness and power of America and the role she might play on the\n\nworld stage. One could say pre-emptive strikes were made against\n\nthe “boastful barbarians” as Count Cipriani titled most of the\n\nAmericans he encountered. Without a doubt he followed with interest\n\nthe moves of Count Gaston Raousset-Boulbon, who arrived in San\n\nFrancisco on August 22, 1850, just at moment US laws segregated the\n\nforeign people who came to search for California riches. His arrival\n\ncoincided with the move of thousands of French-people who looked for\n\na way out of the wars in their country, who came to find substance\n\nand well-being in California. Not finding any gold, Raousett wondered\n\nif California’s gold extended into the Mexican State of Sonora. I am\n\nsure Ciprinai wondered this as well, and he may have organized his\n\ncattle drive for such an expedition, he selling some California\n\nproperty to the Rothschilds to bank-roll his adventure that the\n\nBonapartes were well aware of.\n\nRaousset-Boulbon made his first trip to Mexico in February\n\n1852. Once in Mexico City, he met Consul André Levasseur who\n\nintroduced him to investors of a company called La Restauradora whose\n\nmajority partner was Jecker, Torre and Co. On April 7, 1852, Raousset-\n\nBoulbon singed a contract with La Restauradora on which he is\n\nappointed jointly with an “agent”, who he met in San Francisco, to\n\nexplore all places in northern Sonora, and discover gold mines..\n\nThe Count returned to San Francisco, and recruited a company\n\nof about 270 men, in addition to weapons and food. On May 19, 1852,\n\nhe left San Francisco, on the Archival Gracie to arrive Guaymas,\n\nSonora, the first day of July, under a spectacular welcome provided\n\nby the Guaymas people and Sonora authorities. But in no time it was\n\nclear he was a rebel. Raousset-Boulbon granted the company with a\n\nflag with the French colors and the words “Indepéndance de Sonora”.\n\nOn October 1852, General Navarro and Blanco faced Roausset\n\nnear Hermosillo. The treaty with the French company was dissolved,\n\nbut Blanco guaranteed the security of the French. Raousset-Boulbon,\n\nwho had hidden in Guaymas, and did not sign the treaty. The project\n\nin ruin, the French nobleman returned to San Francisco where he\n\nconsolidated his mission in Sonora:\n\nBecoming rich with the supposed Sonora gold\n\nPutting a stop to the US expansionism.\n\nReestablish the pure Latin-blood on the Americas.\n\nTaking revenge on Mariano Arista.\n\nBack in Mexico, Arista was deposed and replaced by Juan\n\nBautista Ceballos as the presidency, then by Manuel María Lombardini,\n\nwho in turn was succeeded by Santa Anna, and Gandsen, US minister to\n\nMexico. Raousset-Boulbon departed from San Francisco on June 16,\n\n1853, arriving in Mexico City on July 7. He met Santa Anna and\n\ndiscused with him his colonization project in Sonora by bringing\n\n6,000 emigrants from Upper California from Europe in six years. Santa\n\nAnna refused the proposals and Raousset-Boulbon’s forces were finally\n\ndefeated by General José María Yáñez on July 13, 1854. He is shot\n\ndead on August 12, 1854.\n\nAround 1860 a group of rich Mexican emigrants met in Europe,\n\nthey had fled the Juarez revolution. Catholic and conservative, they\n\nlooked for support in Europe for their plan to establish a monarchy\n\nin Mexico. They needed money, troops and a genuine European noble.\n\nThe Bonapartes had tried to bestow nobility upon Cipriani, but he\n\nrefused fearing to become more of a puppet then he was. Victor\n\nEmanuel had made him Governor of Balogna, and he would become the\n\nfirst President of the United Kingdom of Italy. Cipriani would marry\n\nan American, Mary Tolly Worhtington of Baltimore County who a\n\ndescendant of George Washington. Cipriani descends from the famous\n\nCaracciolo family of Naples, and appears to be the son of Napoeleon’s\n\nmajor dommo, Franchesci Cipriani. The whole truth is not being told\n\nhere, and Cipriani may have been playing down the royal hand he was\n\ndealt.\n\nJerome Bonaparte married Elizabeth Patterson, and wealthy\n\nheiress. Emperor Napoleon had marred Marie-Louis von Habsburg, and it\n\nwas a Habsburg that be amply qualified to become the first Emperor of\n\nMexico. Napoleon III. gave the emigrants troops, French financial\n\ncircles assured their assistance. The French supported the\n\nconservatives in the civil war with the radicals and occupied the\n\ncapital. They planned an expansion of France on the American soul.\n\nNapoleon did not want to invest money into an affair without\n\nfuture. She did not even bother to go to Vienna. Franz Josef did not\n\nwant to hear anything of its brother, specially not since the\n\nViennese rallied after the lost war against Prussia “Vivat emperor\n\nMaximilian”, who seemed to them as more liberal and the better\n\nemperor for Austria. Her last hope was the Pope, who could have\n\ntalked to Napoleon and Franz Josef, concluded a concordat with Mexico\n\nand convinced the Mexican catholic church. But Pius IX. only wanted\n\nto pray. Charlotte fell into depression, one night fled from the\n\nhotel and required lodging in the Vatican. Her brother brought the\n\nmentally ill Empress back to Miramar.\n\nIt appears that Cipriani was successful in uniting the House\n\nof Savoy with the Bonapartes, and thus the House of Stuart. Prince\n\nNapoleon Joseph Charles Paul of France, Pr Napoléon, married in Turin\n\nin 1859, Princess Clothilde of Savoy daughter of Victor Emanuel.\n\nhttp://shannonselin.com/2014/08/joseph-bonapartes-secretary-louis-mailliard/\n\nhttp://shannonselin.com/2014/08/joseph-bonapartes-secretary-louis-mailliard/\n\nCount Cipriani was born in Centuri Corsica, on October 10,\n\n1812. On his father’s side he is descended from an old Florentine family of Ghibellines, which after a long struggle with the vitorious Guelfs, found refgue in Corsica in the fifteenth century. On his mother’s side he is descended from Saint Francis Caracciolo of Naples, and thus Saint Aquinas. This struggle inspired Shakespear to write ‘Romeo and Juliet’ and thus the question “What is in a name?” came to be.\n\nHe was born in the Palais Royalof Paris during the Second French Empirethe son of thePrince Napoleonand his wife, Princess Marie Clothilde of Savoy, daughter of Victor Emmanuel II of Italy. Two younger siblings would soon follow: Prince Louis (1864–1932) and Princess Maria Letizia Bonaparte(1866–1926), later the Duchess of Aosta. At the time of his birth, he was third in the line of succession to the throne behind the Prince Imperial and his father. The Empire came to an end in 1870 with the abdication of the Emperor Napoleon III.\n\nVictor, Prince Napoléon, titular 4th Prince of Montfort(Napoléon Victor Jérôme Frédéric Bonaparte; 18 July 1862 – 3 May 1926) was the Bonapartistpretender to the French throne from 1879 until his death in 1926. He was known asNapoléon Vby his supporters.\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Victor,_Prince_Napol%C3%A9on\n\n“Returning to Paris in October, 1855, he was warmly received by his friend Prince Napoleon who overwhelmed him with questions about his travels in America. “I answered them the best I could.” Cipriani wrote, “But , it is a veritable deluge….We keep talking about my journeys, of the Sanora, of conquering it.” Perhaps he thought of seizing it for France and hoped the prince might persuade his cousin the Emperor to finance the undertaking. “It is an idea in the air,” he added, “that I would willingly undertake, if necessary capital and men were available.”To another member of the imperial household, Jerome Bonaparte, ex-king of Westphalia, Cipriani revealed tha the had considerable investments in California and hinted at receiving interest of twelve to fifteen percent a month on his money. He also boasted of his house in Belmont which “out there is considered magnificent.”On behalf of the Emperor Napoleon 3, he visited King Victor Emanuel of Sardinia to explore the possibilities of a matrimonial arrangement between the ruling houses as a prelude to a political-military alliance between France and Sardinia. The conversation eventually turned to Cipriani’s overland journey of 1853, which apparently had not escaped the king’s notice. “I have heard tell,” he said, “of a great journey of yours, with you on horseback and camping out.”“For eight solid months, Your Majesty,” Cipriani replied, making certain to include the time he left San Francisco in February to October, 1853.“But it is true.” the king continued, “that you led covered wagons and crossed the Rocky Mountains where there was roads, and great rivers without any bridges.”\n\nThe above is from the ‘California and Overland Diaries of Count Leonetto Cipriani’. a journey that may constitute the first cattle drive. What this diary reveals is France’s plan to conquer Mexico, and perhaps the Western United States.\n\nhttp://www.napoleon-series.org/research/napoleon/c_arsenic.html\n\nhttp://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Gazetteer/Places/America/United_States/_Topics/history/_Texts/MnDBIA/4*.html\n\nRiding west on Sir Francis Drake Boulevard, motorists and cyclists blow right by the San Geronimo Valley Cultural Center – unless they happen to know this is the place to see winter-run salmon in the creek and a WPA mural in the lobby.\n\nThe bucolic landscape is 15 feet wide, 7 feet tall, and 50 feet off the road. It’s worth a stop just to see how little has changed along the way out to Olema and Point Reyes in the 70 years since it was painted by Maurice Del Mue. A Parisian by way of San Francisco, Del Mue came out here to live and paint in 1925 as part of a migration as consistent as the salmon. The valley claims the highest concentration of artists in Marin County, and that’s saying something given all the watercolorists in Mill Valley.\n\n“Because of the beauty, it’s like Santa Fe, N.M. It just brings that out in people,” explains Susan Lahr, who has lived here for 30 years. “It’s a huge artistic community – recording artists, visual artists, literary artists.”\n\nThere are enough artists that the Two Bird Cafe has its own curator. The valley has almost as many post offices per capita as there are artists – four for 4,000 people. Each of the villages has its own – Woodacre, San Geronimo, Forest Knolls and Lagunitas. “You meet your friends and neighbors at the post office on a daily basis,” Lahr says.http://www.sfgate.com/magazine/article/Valley-of-the-Artists-Mural-still-speaks-to-2511837.php\n\n“This is a real ’60s place. Jerry Garcia, Janis Joplin, Quicksilver – they all lived out here,” says Lahr, who didn’t arrive from her hometown of Pittsburgh until 1973 – which was in time for Elvin Bishop and the day Garcia died at Serenity Knolls, the recovery center in Forest Knolls. They also lost folksinger Kate Wolf, but she is brought back the third Sunday of each month with Kate’s Cafe, featuring performance art in the Cultural Center. It starts at 6:30 tonight. The two galleries are open, and the mural is lighted in the lobby. (It can also be seen weekdays, or by calling Lahr, the Cultural Center arts and events coordinator, at (415) 488-9385, Ext. 4.)\n\nFive miles west of Fairfax, the San Geronimo Valley is entered by crossing Brown’s Bridge at White’s Hill, the great divide between rich Marin and West Marin. Opened this year, the 380-foot bridge is touted as the longest single- span west of the Mississippi.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3wuv40jXjxQ\n\nhttp://www.sgvcc.org/valley/history.html\n\nhttps://rosamondpress.com/2015/05/23/the-chosen-family/\n\nhttp://www.emperornorton.net/norton-drury.txt"
