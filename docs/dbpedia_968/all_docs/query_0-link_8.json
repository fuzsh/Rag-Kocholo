        "text": "by An Ard Rí, Scott Mehl, and Susan Flantzer\n\n© Unofficial Royalty 2019\n\nAll portraits and photos are from Wikipedia unless otherwise noted.\n\nThe Royal Seat of San Lorenzo de El Escorial was built by King Felipe II of Spain for several purposes, one being the final resting place of the Kings of Spain. The complex includes a palace, basilica, monastery, and library. The Royal Crypt is located beneath the basilica and the convent. There are two separate Pantheons containing the remains. The Pantheon of Kings contains the remains of Kings and Queen Consorts who were also mothers of Kings of Spain. The Pantheon of Infantes is the resting place of other members of the Spanish Royal Family.\n\nHowever, the royal remains are not initially interred in the Pantheons. Instead, the remains are taken to one of two decaying chambers (pudridero), where they remain for 30 to 40 years. The purpose of the pudridero is to reduce the size of the remains so that they will fit in lead chests, 3.2 feet/1 meter long and 16 inches/40 centimeters wide. The remains are then interred in the marble sepulchers or tombs in either the Pantheon of Kings or the Pantheon of Infantes. This procedure is overseen by the Augustinian monks of the Monastery of El Escorial.\n\n********************\n\nThe Pantheon of Kings\n\nThe Pantheon of Kings is located beneath the basilica and consists of 26 marble sepulchers containing the remains of the Kings and Queens of Spain. As seen in the layout above, it is octagonally shaped, with the sepulchers stacked in six columns around the room. An additional two sepulchers are located above the entrance.\n\nKing Juan Carlos made exceptions for the final resting place of his parents. Although his father did not reign, Juan, Count of Barcelona was the heir apparent of his father King Alfonso XIII because both of his elder brothers renounced their rights of succession. When Alfonso XIII, who had lost his throne when the Second Spanish Republic was declared in 1931, knew that his life was coming to an end, he formally abdicated in favor of his son Juan, who became the pretender to the Spanish throne. The dictator Francisco Franco had declared that the monarchy would be restored upon his own death. However, Franco felt that Juan would be too liberal, so he passed over him and chose Juan’s son, Juan Carlos, as heir to the Spanish throne. Although Juan, Count of Barcelona never reigned, he is considered a de jure king and he and his wife are parents of a king.\n\nThe remains of King Alfonso XIII’s third son Juan, Count of Barcelona and daughter-in-law Maria de las Mercedes (the father and mother of the former King Juan Carlos I), lie in the pudridero, awaiting interment in the Pantheon of the Kings. When these remains are interred, all the sepulchers in the Pantheon of Kings will be filled. There have also been two Queen Consorts interred in the Pantheon of Kings who were not mothers of kings. No decision has been announced as to the final resting place of former King Juan Carlos I and his wife Queen Sofía or King Felipe VI and Queen Letizia, the present king and queen.\n\n********************\n\nThe Pantheon of Infantes\n\nThe Pantheon of Infantes is a series of chambers housing the tombs of Infantes, Infantas, and Queen Consorts who were not the mothers of a future King. One of the chambers has a large white marble tomb shaped ‘like a birthday cake’. This structure was completed in 1888 and has niches for 60 tombs. This was originally used for young children who had not yet had their First Communion before they died. Elsewhere in the chambers are tombs of different shapes and styles, all in white marble. The Pantheon of Infantes has its own pudridero (decaying chamber) where the remains of the deceased stay for 20 to 30 years and then be interred.\n\n********************\n\nThe Spanish House of Bourbon began its reign in 1700 and continues to the present day although there have been some lapses over the years. The first ruler of the House of Bourbon, King Felipe V, was born Philippe of France, Duke of Anjou. He was the second of the three sons of Louis, Le Grand Dauphin, the heir apparent to the throne of France. At the time of his birth, his grandfather Louis XIV was King of France. In 1700, Carlos II, King of Spain died childless with no immediate Habsburg heir. Philippe’s father Louis, Le Grand Dauphin had the strongest genealogical claim to the throne of Spain because his mother Maria Teresa, Infanta of Spain had been the half-sister of Carlos II. However, neither Philippe’s father nor his elder brother, Louis, Duke of Burgundy, could be displaced from their place in the succession to the French throne. Therefore, Carlos II named 16-year-old Philippe, Duke of Anjou as his successor in his will. There were periods over the years when Spain was not a monarchy and had a different form of government. Also, there were two Kings of Spain who were not from the House of Bourbon. Their burial information will be included below.\n\nHouse of Bourbon\n\nFelipe V: first reign November 16, 1700 – January 14, 1724, abdicated in favor of his son\n\nLuis I: reigned January 14, 1724 – August 31, 1724\n\nFelipe V: second reign September 6, 1724 – July 9, 1746, reinstated upon the death of his son\n\nFernando VI: reigned July 9, 1746 – August 10, 1759\n\nCarlos III: reigned August 10, 1759 – December 14, 1788\n\nCarlos IV: reigned December 14, 1788 – March 19, 1808, abdicated\n\nFernando VII: first reign March 19, 1808 – May 6, 1808, forced to abdicate by Napoleón Bonaparte\n\nHouse of Bonaparte\n\nJoseph Bonaparte (José I Napoleón), brother of Napoleón Bonaparte, reigned June 6, 1808 – December 11, 1813, abdicated\n\nHouse of Bourbon (1st restoration)\n\nFernando VI): second reign December 11, 1813 – September 29, 1833\n\nIsabella II: reigned September 29, 1833 – September 30, 1868, deposed; provisional government until Amadeo I was elected King of Spain\n\nHouse of Savoy\n\n(Amadeo I: reigned December 4, 1870 – February 11, 1873, abdicated\n\nFirst Spanish Republic: February 11, 1873 – December 29, 1874\n\nHouse of Bourbon (2nd restoration)\n\nAlfonso XII: reigned December 30, 1874 – November 25, 1885\n\nAlfonso XIII: reigned May 17, 1886 – April 14, 1931, posthumous son of Alfonso XII, became King of Spain upon his birth\n\nSecond Spanish Republic: April 14, 1931 – March 28, 1939\n\nDictatorship of Francisco Franco: April 1, 1939 – November 20, 1975\n\nHouse of Bourbon (3rd restoration)\n\nJuan Carlos I: reigned November 22, 1975 – June 19, 2014, abdicated\n\nFelipe VI: reigned June 19, 2014 – present\n\nAll pictures/photos of members of the Spanish Royal Family are from Wikipedia unless otherwise indicated.
