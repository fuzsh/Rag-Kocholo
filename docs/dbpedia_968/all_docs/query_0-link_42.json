CHAUCER. PREFACE. The object of the present Handbook , like that of the Editors other works of the same description, is to render the traveller as independent as possible of the services of guides, valets-de-place, and others of the same class, to supply him with a few remarks on the progress of civili- sation and art among the people with whom he is about to become acquainted, and to enable him to realise to the fullest extent the enjoyment and instruction of which Italy is so fruitful a som*ce. The Handbook is, moreover, intended to place the tra- veller in a position to visit the places and objects most de- serving of notice with the greatest possible economy of time, money, and, it may be added, temper; for in no country is the travellers patience more severely put to the test than in some parts of Italy. The Editor will endeavour to accompany the enlightened traveller through the streets of the Italian towns, to all the principal edifices and works of art ; and to guide his steps amidst the exquisite scenery in which Italy so richly abounds. With a few very trifling exceptions, the entire book is framed from the Editor s personal experience, acquired at the places described. As, however, infallibility cannot be at- tained the editor will highly appreciate any hnnd Jide in- formation with which travellers may favour him. That al- ready received, which in many instances has been most serviceable, he gratefully acknowledges. The Maps and Plans, the result of great care and research , will abundantly suffice for the use of the ordi- nary traveller. The inexperienced are strongly recommended, when steering their course with the aid of a plan , before VI starting, to mark with a coloured pencil tlie point for which they are bound. This will enable them to avoid many a circuitous route. Travellers who desire a more minute ac- quaintanee with Northern Italy will find the following? ex- cellent maps most serviceable : Kicpert's ^Spcrial Map of N. mid Ci'iilral Itah/ , pub. by D.

Hotels. In no country does the treatment which the traveller experiences at hotels vary so much as in Italy, and attempts at extortion are probably nowhere so outra- geous. The asterisks are therefore to be regarded as in- dicating those hotels which the Editor believes to be com- 2mrat{vely respectable, clean and reasonable. The average charges stated in the handbook will at least enable the tra- veller to form a fair estimate of the demands which can be justly made. CONTENTS. Page I. Travelling Expenses.

INTRODUCTION. \"Thou art the garden of the world, the home Of all Art yields, and Nature can decree; Even in thy desert, what is like to theeV Thy very weeds arc beautiful, thy waste More rich than other climes' fertility, Thy wreck a glory, and thy ruin graced With an immaculate charm which cannot be defaced.\" Byron. From the earliest ages clown to the present time Italy Las ever exercised a powerful influence on the denizens of more northern lands , and a journey thither has often been the fondly cherished wish of many an aspiring traveller. At the present day this wish may be gratified with comparative facility. A great network of railways now overspreads the entire peninsula, and even the more remote towns may be visited \\vith little sacrifice of time. Northern Italy . more especially , with Milan . Venice, and Genoa , is of very easy access to travellers in Switzerland and the Tyrol ; and, although its attractions are doubtless inferior to those of Florence, Rome, and Naples, it is replete with in- terest and instruction for the ordinary traveller . as well as for those whose object is scientific research. Rapidity of locomotion is not, however, the sole advantage which has been attained since that period. A single monetary system has superseded the numerous and perplexing varieties of coinage formerly in use: the annoyances inseparable from passports and custom-houses, with which the traveller was assailed at every frontier . and even in many an insignificant town, have been greatly mitigated : and energetic measures have been adopted in order to put an end to the extortions of vetturini , facchini and other members of this irritating class. I. Travelling Expenses. Monetary System. The cost of a tour in Italy depends of course on the travel- ler's resources and habits. Generally it may be stated that the expenses need not exceed those incurred in the more frequented parts of the continent. The average expenditure of a single tra- veller may be estimated at 25 fr. per diem . or about half that sum when a prolonged stay is made at one place. Those who XII MONEY. are acquainted with the language and habits of the country may succeed in reducing their expenses to still narrower limits. In the Kingdom of Italy the French monetary system is now universal. The franc (lira or franco) contains 100 centesimi : 1 fr. 25 c. = 1 s. = 10 silbergroschen = 35 S. German kreuzer = 50 Austrian kreuzer. The silver coins in common circulation are Italian pieces of 1 and 2 fr., and Italian or French 5 fr. pieces ; gold coins of the Italian or F'rench currency of 10 and 20 fr. are the commonest (those of 5 and 40 fr, rare). The 5-centime piece, or sou, is termed soldo. Since the war of 18GG a paper-currency , at a compulsory rate of exchange , has been introduced , in consequence of which the valuable metals have entirely disappeared from ordinary circulation. Copper and bank- notes down to 2 fr. are almost exclusively encountered. Besides this paper-currency issued by government, a number of towns issue notes of 50 c. and 1 fr., which are utterly worthless In other parts of the country. The change for gold or silver should always be given in silver ; and paper should be declined , unless 6 — 7 per cent in excess of the value be proffered , a premium which the money-changers generally give. In the same way paper may be exchanged for gold or silver, at a loss of 8 — 10 per cent. Two points, however, should in the latter case be observed : (1) the notes of small amount (2 and 5 fr.) should be preferred, owing to the difficulty of changing those of greater value in ordinary traffic ; (2) public and railway offices refuse to give change when payment is made in paper. In the latter case the precise sum should be tendered, as any amount in excess, or short of the fare is alike declined. In case of emergencies , the traveller should of course be provided with a reserve of silver. French banknotes are on a par with gold. — The traveller in Venetia, where the Austrian currency is still in common circulation, should observe that a florin = 21/2 fr- = 100 kr. ; a kreuzer is therefore equivalent to 2^2 centimes. The traveller should , before entering Italy , provide himself with French Gold . or French Banknotes , which he may procure in England, France or Germany on more advantageous terms than in Italy, Sovereigns are received at the full value (25 fr, in silver) by most of the principal hotel keepers , but this is not the case in the less frequented districts. For the transport of large sums the 10 I. circular notes Issued by the London bankers will be found convenient. II. Period and Plan of Tour. The season selected, and the duration of the tour determined on must of course depend on the traveller himself. As a general rule the spring and autumn months are the most favourable, especially September, when the heat of summer has considerably LA.NGUAGE. XIII abated. The winter in Lombardy and Piedmont is not less severe than in England and W. Europe generally. Nice and Venice are recommended as the most suitable residences for the cold season. The height of summer can hardly be recommended for travelling. The scenery , indeed , is then in perfection , and the long days are hailed with satisfaction by the active traveller ; but the fierce rays of an Italian sun seldom fail to exercise a prejudicial influence upon the physical and mental energies. This result is not occasioned so much by the intensity as by the protracted duration of the heat , the sky being frequently cloudless and not a drop of rain falling for several months in succession. The first showers of autumn, which fall about the end of August, again commence to refresh the parched atmosphere. m. Language. The time and labour which the traveller has bestowed on the study of the Italian language at home will be amply repaid as he proceeds on his journey. It is by no means impossible to travel through Italy without an acquaintance with Italian or French, but in this case the traveller cannot conveniently deviate from the ordinary track and is moreover invariably charged (alia Inglese) by hotel-keepers and others, considerably in excess of the ordi- nary prices. A knowledge of French is of the greatest advan- tage, for the Italians are extremely partial to that language, and avail themselves of every opportunity of employing it. For those, however, who desre to confine their expenditure within the average limits . a slight acquaintance with the language f of the country is indispensable. Nowhere more than in Italy is the traveller who is ignorant of the language debarred from much of the true enjoyment of travelling , and from the opportunity of forming an independent opinion of the country, its customs, history, literature and art. t ''Baedeker's Manual of Conversation in fov.r languages (English, French, German and Italian) icith vocabulary etc.\"\" (20th edit.^ will be found ser- viceable for this purpose. With the addition of a pucket-dictionarj- the tra- veller may safely encounter the difficulties of the situation. A few brief remarks on the pronunciation may here be made for the benefit of those unacquainted with the language. C before e and / is pronounced like the English ch , g before e and i like j. Before other vowels c and g are hard. Ch and gh, which generally precede e or /, are hard; sc before e or i is pronounced like sh, gn and gl between vowels like ny and ly. In other respects the pronunciation of Italian more nearly resembles that of German than that of French or English. The prosody occasionally presents difficul- ties_, being different from what one would naturally expect : e. g. Udine, Vigevano , K^abresina. — In addressing persons of the educated classes 'lei' with the 3rd pers. sing, should always be employed (addressing several at once , 'loro' with the 3rd pers. pi.) 'Voi' is used in addressing waiters, drivers etc. , 'tii' bj- those only who are proficient in the language. 'Voi' is the commonest mode of address employed by the Neapolitans, but is ge- nerally regarded as inelegant or uncourteous. XIV MENDICITY. IV. Passports and Custom-houses. On entering the kingdom of Italy, the traveller's passport is rarely demanded, but it is unwise not to be provided with one of these documents , as it may occasionally prove useful. Re- gistered letters, for example, will not be handed over to strangers, unless they exhibit a passport to prove their identity. The examination of luggage at the Italian Custom-houses is usually extremely lenient. Tobacco and cigars are the articles especially sought for. V. Public Safety. Mendicity. Italy is still frequently regarded as the land of Fra Diavolo's and Rinaldo Rinadini's — an impression fostered by tales of travellers, sensational letters to newspapers, etc. The fact, how- ever , is , that travelling in Northern and Central Italy is hardly attended with more hazard than in any of the more northern European countries. Mendicity, countenanced and encouraged according to the former system of Italian politics, still continues to be one of those national nuisances to which the traveller must habituate himself. The system is energetically opposed by the new regime, but in Venetia and many of the smaller towns it prevails to the same extent as formerly. Begging in Italy, to a still greater degree than in other places , is rather a trade than a genuine demand for sympathy. The best mode of liberation is to bestow a small donation , a supply of the smallest coin of the realm being provided for the purpose. A beggar, who in return for a donation of 2 c. thanked the donor with the usual benedictions, was on another occasion presented with 50 c. , an act of libera- lity which, instead of being gratefully accepted, only called forth the remark in a half-offended tone: \"ma signore e molto poco!'' VI. Traffic. In Italy the highly pernicious custom of demanding considerably more than will ultimately be accepted is the invariable rule : but with a knowledge of the custom, as it is based entirely upon the presumed ignorance of one of the contracting parties , the evil is greatly mitigated. Where tariffs and fixed charges exist , they should be care- fully consulted. In other cases a certain average price is gene- rally established by custom , under which circumstances the tra- veller should make a precise bargain with respect to the service to be rendered, and never rely on the equity of the other party. Those individuals who appeal to the generosity of the stran- ger, or to their own honesty, or who, as rarely happens, are offended by the traveller's manifestation of distrust, may well be TRAFFIC. XV answered in the words of the proverb : -patti chiari, amicizia lunga'\\ In the following pages the prices, even of insignificant objects, are stated with all possible accuracy; and although they are liable to constant fluctuations, they will at least serve as a guide to the stranger and prove a safeguard against many gross extortions. The editor ventures to offer a homely hint, that the equanimity of the traveller's own temper will greatly assist him if involved in a dispute or a bargain, and no attention whatever should be paid to vehement gesticulations or an offensive de- meanour. The less the knowledge of the Italian langua e, the more careful should the traveller be not to involve himself in a war of words, in which he must necessarily be at great disadvantage As a matter of course , no weight should be attached to the representations of drivers, guides etc., with whom even the in- habitants of the place often appear to act in concert. Caution is everywhere desirable in Italy, but if it assumes the form of exaggerated distrust it may be construed as the re- sult of fear or weakness on the part of the traveller, whose best safeguard is often his own self-confidence; and it must be admitted , that , the preliminaries once arranged , a trustwor- thiness is ofcen exhibited of which an earlier demeanour gave no promise. An abundant supply of copper coins should always be at the traveller's command in a country wliere very frequent, though trifling donations are in constant demand. Drivers, guides, porters, donkey-attendants etc. invariably expect, and often demand as their right, a gratuity (huona mano, mancia, da here, hottlglia , caffe, fumata) in addition to the hire agreed on , and which varies according to circumstances from 2 — 3 sous to a franc or more. The traveller need feel no embarrassment in limiting his dona- tions to the smallest possible dimensions. Liberality is frequently a source of future annoyance and embarrassment. Half-a-franc bestowed where two sous would have sufficed may be fertile in disagreeable results to the injudicious traveller; the fact speedily becomes known, and other applicants make their appea- rance whose demands it becomes utterly impossible to satisfy. The demeanour of the stranger towards the natives must be somewhat modified in accordance with the various parts of the country through which he travels. Northern Italy, with the exception perhaps of Venice , may on the whole be pronounced safe in this respect. As a rule , the inhabitants of this part of the country will be found polite and obliging, whilst attempts at extortion are comparatively rare , and fixed scales of charges at the hotels and shops aft-e now becoming more universal. XVI LOCOMOTION. VII. Locomotion. Railways. With regard to the rapid advance of this modern essential of civilisation the remarks already made (p. XI) may suffice. It may be added that the greatest speed attained by the trains is extremely moderate. The most trustworthy information respecting hours of starting- fares etc. is afforded by the '■Guida orario ufficiale di tutte le strade ferrate d'ltalia' (see p. VI), containing a map, published at Milan by Edoardo Sonzogno (price 40 c), with which the traveller should not fail to provide himself. Steamboats. Tickets should be purchased by the traveller in person at the office of the company , and no attention paid to the proffered services of loiterers in the vicinity. Family-tickets for the first or second class for not fewer than three persons are issued by all the companies at a reduction of 20 per cent on the fare, but not on the cost of food. A child of 2 — 10 years pays half-fare, but in this case must share the berth of its atten- dant. Two children are furnished with a berth for themselves. The tickets of the Messageries Imperiales are available for four months, and the voyage may be broken at the passenger's discretion\". The saloons and berths of the first class are comfortably and elegantly fitted up, those of the second tolerably. Luggage. First-class passengers are allowed 100 kiiogr. (= 2 cwt.), second-class 60 kiiogr. (= 135 lbs.); but articles not intended for the passenger's private use are prohibited. Food of good quality and ample quantity is included in the first and second-class fares. The d.fference between that provi- ded for passengers of the different classes is inconsiderable. Pas- sengers who are too ill to partake of these repasts are furnished with lemonade and minor restoratives gratuitously. Refreshments may of course be procured at other hours on payment. Fees. The steward expects 1 fr. for a voyage of 12 — 24 hrs., more if the passenger has made unusual demands upon his time or patience. Embarcation. Passengers should be on board an hour be- fore the advertised time of starting. The charges for cojiveyance to the steamboat (usually 1 fr. for each pers. with luggage) are fixed by tariff at all the sea-ports, and will be found in the hand- book. Passengers should therefore avoid all discussions on the subject with the boatmen , and simply direct them to row 'alia Bella Venezia', or whatever the name of the vessel may be. On arriving at the vessel, payment should not be given to the boatman until the traveller and his luggage are deposited on deck. Diligences in Italy generally belong to; private companies ; where se-^eral run in competition, the more expensive are to be preferrred. The carriages are often uncomfortable, and, when ladies are of HOTELS. XVII the party, the coupe (Vsi'^^ dearer) shoukl if possible be secured. Regular comaiuiiicatiou cannot be depended on , except on the principal routes. The importunities of tlie coachmen at the end of each stage should be disregarded. Vetturini, by whom the sole communication between many towns was formerly maintained, are now entirely superseded by the more modern diligences and railways. The ordinary traveller will pro- bably rarely have occasion to submit to this obsolete style of conveyance , except on the route between Savona and Mentone, and Chiavari and La Spezia. The charges of the carriages are stated in the Handbook; the traveller is, however, recommended to make a previous personal agreement with the vetturino (agents to be avoided). The contract is made 'tutto compreso', and if satisfaction is given , an additional fee may be bestowed at the termination of the journey. A single traveller may also bargain with a vetturino for a place, the charge for which varies. The back-seats are 'i primi posti', which are generally secured by the first comers , who are first consulted with rega:d to the arrangement of the journey. Besides the above-mentioned conveyances, carriages may every- where be hired (one-horse about 80 c. per Engl. M.). Prolonged walking - tours . such as are undertaken in more northern climates, and fatiguing excursions will be found wholly unsuitable to the Italian climate. Cool and clear weather should if possible be selected and the sirocco carefully avoided. The height of summer is totally adverse to tours of this kind. A horse (cavallo) or donkey (sommaro), between which the difference of expen.e is inconsiderable, often affords a pleasant and inexpensive mode of locomotion, especially in mountainous districts, where the attendant (pedone) acts at once as a servant for the time being and as a guide. Vin. Hotels. The idea of cleanliness in Italy is in arrcar of the age; the brilliancy of the southern climate perhaps, in the opinion of the natives, neutralizes dirt. The traveller will, however, not suffer much annoyance in this respect in hotels and lodgings of the best class. Those who quit the beaten track, on the other hand, must be prepared for pr vations. Insect-powder (polvere di Persia) or powdered camphor is some antidote to the advances of noc- turnal intruders. The zanzare , or gnats, are a source of great annoyance , and often suffering , during the autumn months, \"Windows should always be carefully closed before a light is introduced into the room. Light muslin curtains (zanzarieri) round tlie beds , masks for the face, and gloves are employed to ward off the attacks of these pertinacious tormentors. iiAiDEKEK. Italy I. 2nd Edit. b XVIII HOTELS. In all the more frequented places , good hotels of the first class, equal in comfort to those in other parts of Europe, are always to be found, the landlords of which are frequently German and Swiss. Booms 2V2 — 5 fi'-? bougies 75 c. — 1 fr., attendance 1 fr., table d'hote 4 fr. and so on. Families, for whose reception the hotels are often specially fitted up , should make an agree- ment with the landlord with regard to pension (8 — 10 fr. each). Strangers are expected to dine at the table d'hote , otherwise the price of the room is raised, or the inmate is given to under- stand that it is let over his head. French spoken everywhere. Cuisine a mixture of French and Italian. The second-class inns are thoroughly Italian , rarely very clean or comfortable; charges about one-half the above; no table d'hote, but a trattoria will generally be found connected with the house , where refreshments a la carte may be procured at any hour. These establishments will often be found convenient and economical by the voyageur en gar(,'on , but are of course rarely visited by ladies. The best hotels have fixed charges. Attendance, exclusive of boots and commissionaire, is charged in the bill. This is not the case in the smaller inns, where 1 fr. per diem is usually divided between the waiter and the facchiuo, or less for a prolonged stay. Copper coins are never despised by such recipients. Hotels Garnis are much frequented by those whose :;tay ex- tends to 10 — 14 days and upwards, and the inmates enjoy greater quiet and independence than at a hotel. The charges are moreover considera! ly more moderate. Attendance about 1/2 fr. per diem. Lodgings, of various degrees of comfort and accommodation, may also be procured for a prolonged residence. Here, likewise, a distinct agreement respecting the rent should be made before- hand. Where a whole suite of apartments is hired, a written contract should be drawn up with the aid of some one acquainted with the language and customs of the place (e. g. a banker). For single travellers a verbal agreement with regard to attendance, linen, stoves and carpets in winter, a receptacle for coal etc., will generally suffice. A few hints may be here added for the benefit of ihe less experienced : If a prolonged stay be made at a hotel , the bill should be demanded every three or four days, by which means errors, whether accidental or designed , are more easily detected. When the traveller contemplates de- parting at an early hour in the morning, the bill should be obtained on the previous evening, but not paid until the moment for starting has arrived. It is a favourite practice to withhold the bill till the last moment, when the hurry and confusion render overcharges less liable to discovery. The mental arithmetic of waiters is apt to be exceedingly faulty, though rarely in favour of the traveller. A written enumeration of the items charged should therefore invariably be required, and accounts rejected in which, as not unfrequentiy happens, '■colazione, prcwzo^ vino, c,affe etc' figure in the aggregate. RESTAURANTS. XIX Information obtained from waiters and others of a similar class can seldom be implicitly relied upon. Enquiries slioiild be addressed to the landlords or head-^Yaiters alone, and even their statements received with caution. IX. Restaurants and Cafes. Restaurants (trattorie) are chiefly frequented by Italians, and travellers unaccompanied by ladies. Dinner may be obtained a la carte at any hour between 12 and 7 or 8 p. m., for I1/2 — 3 fr. The waiters expect a gratuity of 2—4 soldi. The diner who desires to confine his expenses within reasonable limits should refrain from ordering dishes not comprised in the bill of fare. A late hour for the principal repast of the day should be selected in winter, in order that the daylight may be profitably employed. — Importunities on the part of the waiters are usually disposed of by the expression 'non seccarmf. The following list comprises most of the commoner Ita- lian dishes : Zuppa, soup. Consume J broth or bouillon. Sante or minestra , soup with green vegetables and bread. Gnocchij small puddings. Riso con piselU , rice- soup with peas. Risotto, a species of rice pud- ding (rich). Maccaroni al burro, with butter; al pomi cVoro , with paradise apples. ManzOj boiled beef. Frlttij fried meat. Arrosti, roasted meat. Bistecca, beefsteak. Coscletlo, loin. Arrosto di vitello, roast veal. Testa di vitello, calf's head. Fegato di vitello, calfs liver. Bracciolettadi vitello, veal-cutlet. Costoletta alia minuta, veal-cutlet with calf's ears and truffles. Palate, potatoes. Quaglia, quail. Tor do, field -fare. Lodola, lark. Sfoglid, a species of sole. Prinripi alia tavola, hot relishes. Polio, fowl. Pollastro, turkey. Umidi, meat with sauce. Stufatino, ragout. Erhe, vegetables. Curciofi, artici.okes. PiselU. peas. Lenticchie, lentils. Cavoli fiori, cauliflower. Fave, beans. Fagiuolini, French beans, Mostarda, simple mustard. Senape, hot mustard. Ostriche, oysters (good in winter o.dy). Giardinetto, fruit-deseit. Crostata di frutti, fruit-tart. Crostata di pasta sfoyla, a spe- cies of pastry. Fragole, strawberries. Pera, pear. Persiche, peaches. Uva, bunch of grapes. Limone, lemon. Poriogullo, orange. Finocchio, root of feniiel. Pane francese, biead made with yeast (the Italian is made\\ without). XX CAFES. FunyJd , musLrooms (often too ricli). Presclutto, ham. Formayyio, cheese. Vino nero, red wine ; bianco, white; asciutto, dry; dolce, Salami, sausage. j sweet; nostrale, table-wine. Cafes are frequented for breakfast and lunch, and in the evening by numerous consumers of ices. Cafe noir (caffe neroj is usually drunk (20 c. per cup). Caffe latte is coffee mixed with milk before served (20 c), or caffe e latte, i. e. with the milk served separately, may be peferred. Mischio is a mixture of coffee and chocolate (15 — 20 c), considered wholesome and nutritious. The usual viands for lunch are ham, sausages, cutlets and eggs (uova da here, soft; toste, hard; uova al piatto, fried). Ices (sorhetto or gelato) of every possible variety are supplied at the cafes (30 — 90 c. per portion); a half portion (mezzo) may always be ordered. Granita, or half- frozen ice (limonata of le- mons ; aranciata of oranges) , is especially in vogue in the fore- noon. The waiter (hottega) expects a sou or more according to the amount of the payment; he occasionally makes mistakes in changing money, if not narrowly watched. The principal Parisian newspapers are to be found at all the larger cafes, English rarely. Valets de Place (servitori di piazza) may be hired at 5 fr. per diem , the employer previously distinctly specifying the ser- vices to be rendered. They are generally trustworthy and re- spectable , but implicit reliance should not be placed on their statements respecting the places most worthy of a visit , which the traveller should ascertain from the guide-book or other source. Their services may always be dispensed with, unless time is very limited. Travellers are cautioned against employing the sensali, or commissionaires of an inferior class , who pester the stranger with offers of every description. Contracts with vetturini, and similar negociations should never be concluded through such a medium , or indeed any other. Interventions of this description invariably tend to increase prices , and are often productive of still more serious contretemps. This remark applies especially to villages and small towns, whether on or out of the regular track. X. Churches, Theatres, Shops etc. Churches are open till noon , and usually again from 4 to 7 p. m. Visitors may inspect the works of art even during the hours of divine service , provided they move about noiselessly, and keep aloof from the altar where the clergy are officiatins. The verger (sagrestano, or nonzolo) receives a fee of Y2 ^^- ^^ upwards, if his services are required. Theatres. The representations in the large theatres begin at 8, and terminate at midnight or later. Here operas and bal- / SHOPS. XXI lets are exclusively performed; the first act of an opera is usu- ally succeeded by a ballet of 3 or more acts. Yerdi is the most popular composer. The pit (platea) is the usual resort of the men. A box (palco) must always be secured in advance. — A visit to the smaller theatres , where dramas and comedies are acted, is especially recommended for the sake of habituating the ear to the language. Representations in summer take place in the open air, in which case smoking is allowed. The charming co- medies of Goldoni are still among the most popular. — The theatre is a favourite evening -resort of the Italians, by whom during the performance of the music profound silence is never observed. Shops rarely have fixed prices. As a rule two-thirds or three- quarters of the price demanded should be offered. The same rule applies to artizans, drivers and others. ^Non volete?' (then you will not?) is a remark which generally has the effect of bringing the ma;ter to a speedy termination. Purchases should never be made by the traveller when accompanied by a valet- de-place. These individuals, by tacit agreement, receive at least 10 per cent of the purchase-money, which naturally comes out of the pocket of the purchaser. This system of extoriion is carried so far that, when a member of the above class observes a stranger enter a shop, he presents himself at the door and afterwards claims his percentage under the pretext that by his recommendation the purchase has been made. In such cases it is by no means superfluous to call the attention of the shopkeeper to tlie imposition (■•non conosco quest' uorno'). Cigars in Italy, France and Austria are a monopoly of Go- vernment; those under 7 — 10 soldi scarcely smokable. Passers-by freely avail themselves of the light which burns in every cigar- shop, without making any purchase. XI. Postal Arrangements. The address of letters (whether paste restante or to the tra- veller's hotel) should, as a rule, be in the Italian or French language. Postage - stamps are sold at all the tobacco- shops. Letters to England cost 60 c. , France iO c, Germany 40 c, S\\vitzerland_ 30 c, Belgium 40, Holland (via France) 50 c, Denmark 50 c. , Norway and Sweden (via Austria) 75 c, Russia (via Austria) 70 c. , America (United- States) via Eng- land 80 c, via France 1 fr. 20 c. Letters by town-post 5 c. ; throughout the kingdom of Italy 20 c. prepaid, 30 c. unpaid. Letters to Rome must be prepaid as far as the frontier (20 c), also vice versa. In the larger towns the post-office is open the whole day from 9 a. m. to 10 p. m. (also on Sundays and holidays). XXll CLIMATE. XII. Calculation of Time. The old Italian reckoning from 1 to 24 o'clock is now disused, except by tlie humbler classes. Ave Maria = 24. The hours are altered every fortnight, being regulated by the sunset. The or- dinary reckoning of other nations is termed ora francese. The traveller will find little difficulty in employing the Italian reckon- ing should he have occasion to do so. XIII. Climate. Mode of Living. Travellers from the north must in some degree alter their mode of living whilst in Italy , without however implicitly adop- ting the Italian style . Strangers generally become unusually susceptible to cold in Italy, and therefore should not omit to be well supplied with warm clothing for the winter. Carpets and stoves, to the comforts of which the Italians generally appear indifferent, are indispensable in winter. A southern aspect is an absolute essential for the delicate , and highly desirable for the robust. Colds are most easily taken after sunset and in rainy weather. — Even in summer it is a wise precaution not to wear too light clothing. Flannel is strongly recommended. Exposure to the summer -sun should as much as possible be avoided. According to a Roman proverb , dogs and foreigners (Inglesi) alone walk in the sun, Christians in the shade. Um- brellas, and spectacles of coloured glass (grey, concave glasses to protect the whole eye are best) may be used with advantage when a walk in the sun is unavoidable. Repose during the hottest hours is advisable, a siesta of moderate length refreshing. Windows should be closed at night. English and German medical men are to be met with in the larger cities. The Italian therapeutic art does not enjoy a very high reputation in the rest of Europe. German and English chemists, where available , are recommended in preference to the Italian. It may, however, be a wise discretion in maladies arising from local causes to employ native skill. 1. From Paris to Nice by Lyons and Marseilles. Railway to Marseilles in 24 (express in I61J4) hrs. ; fares 96 fr. 65, 72 fr. 50, 53 fr. 15 c. (Express from Paris to Lvons in 9 , ordinary trains 123)4 hrs. ; fares 57 fr. 35 , 43 fr. , 31 fr. 55 c.

From Marseilles to Nice in 7i|2 (express in 6) hrs. ; fares 25 fr. 20, 18 fr. 90, 13 fr. 85 c. Soon after quitting Paris the train crosses the Marne near its confluence with the Seine at the station of Charenton (the lunatic asylum is on an eminence to the left). To the right and left rise the forts of Ivry and Charenton, which here command the course of the Seine. Stat. Villeneuve St. Georges is pictures- quely situated on the slope of a wooded eminence. The beauti- ful green dale of the Teres is now traversed. Picturesque country residences, small parks, and thriving mills are passed in rapid succession. Stat. Montgeron. The chain of hills to the left, as well as the plain, is studded with innumerahle dwellings. Be- fore Brunoy is reached the train crosses the Teres, and beyond the village passes over a viaduct. The valley of the Y&res is now quitted, and the district becomes flatter. Stations Cornbs- la-Ville, Lieusaint, and Cesson. The Seine is again reached and crossed by a handsome iron bridge at Melun (Hotel de France) , capital of the department Seine-et- Marne, an ancient town with a population of 11,000, known to the Romans, and picturesquely situated on an eminence above the river. The Church of Notre Dame , dating from the 10th cent., and the modern Gothic Townhall are fine edifices. After affording several picturesque glimpses of the valley of the Seine, the train reaches the forest of Fontainebleau. Stat. Bois-le-Roi. Fontainebleau (Hotel de Londres ; Aigle Noir ; Hotel de France) is a quiet place with broad and clean streets (popul. 11,900). In the Place du Palais de Justice rises the Statue of General Da- mesme, erected in 1851. The *Palace, an extensive pile, containing five courts, is almost exclusively indebted for its present form to- Francis I. (d. 1547), and abounds in interesting historical remi- niscences. The interior (accessible during the absence of the Emperor, fee 1 fr.) consists of a series of sumptuous saloons and apartments. The Jardin Anglais in the rear of the palace con- tains a pond with the venerable carp of Fontainebleau. The * Forest occupies an area of 50,000 acres (60 M. in circumference) E^DEKEK. Italy I. 2nd Edit. 1 2 Route L SENS. From Paris and affords a number of delightful walks. (For farther details see BcBdekers Paris.') Next Stat. Thomery, celebrated for its luscious grapes (Chas- selas de Fontainebleau). The forest is quitted here. Stat. Moret, a venerable town on the Loing, which here falls into the Seine, possesses a Gothic church of the 13th cent, and a ruined chateau once occupied by Sully. (Railway hence to Nemours, Oien, Ne- vers, and Boanne.) The line crosses the -valley of the Loing by a -viaduct of 30 arches. Stat. St. Mammes; then Montereau (Grand Monarque), picturesquely situated at the confluence of the Seine and Tonne. Here on Feb. 18th, 1814, Napoleon gained his last victory over the Allies and the Prince of Wrirtemberg. (Branch line to Flam- boin , Stat, on the Paris and Troyes line.) The train ascends the broad and well cultivated valley of the Yonne. Stat. Villeneuve-la-Guiard, Pont-sur-Yonne. Sens (Hotel de VEcu), the ancient capital of the Senones, who under Brennus plundered Rome (B.C. 390), the Agedincum of the Romans, is now a quiet and clean town with 11,000 inhab. The early Go- thic * Cathedral (St. Etienne) dates from the 12th cent. ; magni- ficent S. Portal in the Flamboyant style. The episcopal vestments and other relics of Thomas l. Becket, who sought an asylum at Sens in 1164, are shown. The following stations are Villeneuve-sur-Yonne, St. Julien du Sault, Cezy. Joigny (I)uc de Bourgogne), the Joviniacum of the Romans, is a picturesque and ancient town (6000 inhab.) on the Yonne. Next stat. La Roche. From La Roche by a branch line in 52 min. to Auxerre (Hotel du Leo- pard), capital (13,000 inhab.) of the Department of the Yonne, possessing several good churches , especially the late Gothic cathedral. Chahlis , well known for its wines , lies between Auxerre and Tonnerre (see below), 13i|2 M. to the E. of the former. Near La Roche the line crosses the Yonne , into which the Armanfon here empties itself, and follows the latter river and the Canal de Bourgogne, connecting the Seine and Saone. About 6 M. from St. Florentin is the Cistercian Abbey of Pontigny, where Thomas h, Becket passed two years of his exile. Langton, archbishop of Canterbury, banished by John, and other English prelates have also sought a retreat within its walls. Tonnerre (Lion d\" Or ; *Rail. Restaurant), picturesquely situ- ated on the Armangon, a town with 5000 inhab., possesses a monu- ment to the minister Louvois (d. 1691). The church of St. Pierre, on an eminence above the town , commands a pleasing prospect. Stat. Tanlay possesses a fine chateau in the Renaissance style, founded by the brother of Admiral Coligny, the chief victim of St. Bartholomew's Night, who -with the Prince de Conde' and other Huguenot leaders held meetings in one of the apartments. Then a tunnel, 540 yds. in length; bridge over the Arman(;,on ; to Nic€> DIJON. ;. Route. 6 tunnel 1020 yds. long, and the canal and Aiman^on are again crossed. From stat. Nuits-sous-Bav teres a branch-line to ChdtiUon- sur-Seine and Chaumont. Montbard, birthplace (1707J of Buflon, the great naturalist (d. at Paris in 1788), contains his chateau and a monument to his memory. Beyond stat. Blaisy-Bas the line penetrates the culminating ridge, or watershed (1324 ft.}, between the Seine and the Khone by a long tunnel (2^/2 M.). Hence to Dijon a succession of viaducts, cuttings, and tunnels. Beyond stat. Malain, with its ruined chateau , the line enters the picturesque valley of the Ouche, bounded on the r. by the slopes of the Cote d'Or. Dijon (Hotel de la Cloche; duParc; *duJura, near the sta- tion, U. 2, D. 3i|2, B. 1, A. 1J2 fr. De la Galere; de Bourgognej du Nord; de Geneve; the last four of the second class. Rail. Restau- rant 5 *Cafe adjoining the theatre. Brasserie Alsacienne, Place St. Etienne, opposite the theatre), with 39,000 inhab., the ancient capital of the Duchy of Burgundy, is now that of the Department de la Cote d'Or. For upwards of four centuries, from 1015 to the death of Charles the Bold in 1477 , this was the residence of the Dukes of Burgundy. The monuments of that period impart a higher in- terest to this pleasant and cheerful town. The Rue Guillaume leads from the station to the centre of the town, where the * Palais des Etats, the ancient residence of the Dukes , is situated. After various vicissitudes the edifice was remodelled during the last century and converted into an Hotel de Ville. It contains the Museum (principal court to the r. in the Place d'Aimes; admission gratis on Sundays and holi- days 12 — 3 o'clock, at other times for a fee of 1 Ir.J, with col- lections of engravings, statues, casts, antique vases, and smaller antiquities. The \"^Sa^lle des Gardes, formerly the Burgundian banqueting hall, contains a large old chimney-piece ; ' 3 altar-cabinets with beautiful wood- carving (14th cent.); the \"Monument of Jean sans Peur and his consort Margaret, dating from 1444, with their statues and lions at their feet; still liner the ^Monument of Philip the Bold, date 1390, with frieze adorned with 40 statuettes of celebrated contemporaries. Both these monuments were destroyed during the Revolution, but restored in 1828. The Picture Gallery contains about 500 works, most of them me- diocre: 434. Portrait of Charles the Bold, master unknown; 291. Mem- ling (?) , Adoration of the Shepherds; 61. Gagneraux ^ Conde's passage of the Rhine; 318, 319. Rubens, Sketches; 159. Frudhon, Portrait; 399. P. Ve- ronese , Finding of Moses ; 410. Copy of Raphael's School of Athens ; 147. Nattier, Portrait of Maria Lesczinska; 31. C'oypel, Sacrilice of Jephtha; 373. Domenichino (V), St. Jerome; 367. Bassano , The Disciples at Emmaus ; 306. Meulen, Siege of Besancon, 1674 ; 24. Colson, Sleeping girl ; 265. Cham- paigne, Presentation in the Temple. The adjacent second court contains the Musee Archeologique (fee 50 c). 1st Room : Ancient and mediaeval bronzes, weapons , keys , car- ronades, etc. — 2nd R. : Mediaeval sculptures and tombstones. — 3rd R. : Ancient sculptures and tombstones from the Castrum Divionense (the Rom. Dijon) , milestones , remains of an ancient boat found in the Loire in 1859, etc. — The concierge also shows the vast kitchen of the Dukes, erected in 1445. The doors belong to the period of the original structure. ^* ,y 4 Route 1. CHALON. From Paris Farther E. is the church of St. Michael, -with a facade in which the Gothic and Renaissance styles are strangely combined, conse- crated in 1529. — * Notre Dame (N. of the Palais), consecrated in 1445, possessing a peculiar unfinished portico of the 13th cent., is more purely Gothic. — The principal church is that of *St. Be- nigne (S. of the Porte Guillaume), -which has undergone frequent restoration , with portal of the 10th cent. In the vicinity are St. Philihert, of the 12th cent., and St. Jean, consecrated in 1458, the latter now disfigured by modern paintings. The Castle (N. of the Porte Guillaume), now in a half-ruined condition, was erected by Louis XI. (in 1478 — 1512), after the union of Burgundy with France. It was subsequently employed as a state-prison. — Pursuing the same direction round the town the stranger next reaches the bronze Statue of St. Bernhard (born in 1091 at Fontaine lez Dijon), erected in 1847; round the pe- destal are celebrated contemporaries. The town contains a number of picturesque buildings of the Renaissance period, especially interesting to architects. The old ramparts have been converted into promenades. The line to Macon crosses the Ouche and the Canal de Bourgogne (p. 2), and skirts the base of the sunny vineyards of the Cote d'Or, which extend almost the entire distance from Dijon to Chalon and produce the choicest qualities of the Bur- gundy wines (Chambertin, Clos de Bhze, Clos de Vougeot , Ro- manee, Tdche, Nuits, Beaune, etc.). To the r. of stat. Corgoloin is the village of Aloxe, another well-known wine-producing place (Corton, Charlemagne, Clos du Roi). Stat. Beaune, with 11,000 inhab. , on the Bouzoise, contains several Gothic edifices and a monument of the mathematician Monge, who was born here in 1747 (d. 1818). Stat. Meursault. From stat. Chagny a branch-line diverges by Le Creuzot to Nevers. The line passes under the Canal du Centre, which connects the Saone and the Loire, by means of a tunnel, intersects the Col de Chagny, and enters the valley of the Thalie. Stat. Fontaines. Chalon-sur-Sadne (Trois Faisans; Hotel du Chevreuil ; Hotel de V Europe), with 19,000 inhab., the Cabillonum of the Romans, is situated at the junction of the Canal du Centre with the Saone, which is here navigated by steamboats (to Lyons in 5 — 6 hrs.). The town contains little to detain the traveller. The early Go- thic Cathedral, recently restored, exhibits the transition to that style from the Romanesque. (The express trains do not touch Chalon, the branch line to which diverges from the junction St. Cdme.) The line follows the r. bank of the Saone; to the 1. in the distance the Jura is visible ; to the r. in clear weather the snowy summit of Mont Blanc, 150 M. distant. Stat, Tournus (5500 inhab.) possesses a fine abbey-church (St. Philibert). to Nice. BESANgON. 1. Route. 5 MS.COU (Hdtels du Sauvage, des Champs Elysees^ de V Europe ;' Bail. Restaurant) , capital of the Department of the Saone and the Loire, with 18,000 iahab., is another great focus of the wine- trade. The remains of the early Romanesque cathedral of St, Vin- cent are interesting to architects. The line now continues to follow the r. bank of the Saone. ^ Scenery pleasing. The stations between Macon and Lyons, thir- | teen in number, present little to interest the traveller. ^' / Lyons see p. 6. '^ From Strasbourg (Bale) to Lyons by Mulhouse , Besangon, and Bourg^ the most direct route between the S.W. of Germany and S. France.

Mulhouse is the junction of the Bale-Strasbourg and the Bale-Paris lines. The first station of importance is Belfort (8000 inhab.) , a fortress on the Savoureuse , erected by Vauban under Louis XIV. ; the Paris line diverges here.

It is now the capital ot Franche Gomte , with 46,900 inhab. Its peculiar situation in a wide basin , on the Doubs, which flows round the town and once rendered it an important mili- rary point, is described by Caesar (De B. Gal. I. 38). The substantial , old-fashioned architecture of the town is interesting, and modern innovations are comparatively rare. One of the^finest structures of the 16th cent, is the Bdtel de Viile in the Place St. Pierre , bearing the civic motto: Beo et Caesari fidelis perpetuo. The \" Museum is established in a modern building in the Place de I'A- bondance (admission on Sundays 1 — 4 o'cl. gratis, at other times by payment of a fee). The vestibule and the staircases are adorned with Roman inscrip- tions and antiquities. The principal saloon contains pictures : 1. '' 92. A.

Farther on is the ''Forte Noire , a triumphal arch of the late Roman period , of very graceful pro- portions and adorned with sculptures and reliefs , most of which are almost obliterated. The date of its erection is unknown. The r. side has been restored.

Railway Stations. The Oare de Perrache (PL H , 4, 5) is the principal station, where all the trains arrive and depart. The Paris trains also stop at the Gare de Vaise (PL B, 6), reached in 8 min. from the central station; and the Geneva trains at the Gare des Broteaux (PL D, 1), 19 — 24 min. from the central station. Lyons , the ancient Lugdunum , which after the time of Augustus gave its name to one-third part of Gaul, is now the second city, and the most important manufacturing place in France, with 324,000 inhab. Silk is the great staple commodity. Lyons is an archiepiscopal see, As an episcopal residence it is to Nice. LYONS. L Route. 7 mentioned at a very early period. The first bishop St. Potinus is said to have suffered martyrdom in 177, during a fearful perse- cution of the Christians under Marcus Aurelius, which raged here, as well as at Vienne and Autun. The situation of the city at the confluence of the Rhone and Saone is imposing. The Saone is crossed by 10, the Rhone by 7 bridges. Of the latter the Pont de la Guillotiere is the most ancient; its construction is erroneously attributed to Pope Inno- cent IV. (1190). Lyons is one of the best built towns in France. Grand al- terations have been accomplished within the last 50 years, so that the general aspect of the city is modern. It consists of three distinct portions, the original town on the tongue of land between the Rhone and Saone, the suburbs of Les Broteaux and La Guil- lotiere on the 1. bank of the Rhone, and the suburb of Vaise on the r. bank of the Saone. The city is guarded by 18 forts, which form an extensive circle of nearly 12 M., extending from Ste. Foy and Fourvieres and the heights above the suburb of La Croix Rousse (connected with the city by means of a curious railway on an inclined plane, fares 15 and 10 c.) to Les Broteaux and La Guillotiere. The beauty of the situation and the extent of the city are best appreciated when viewed from the ** Height of Fourvieres, i crowned by its conspicuous church, to which a number of different ways lead. The direct route is between the handsome modern Palais de Justice (PI. 67) and the cathedral, through narrow and steep streets, passing the hospital of Les Antiqualles, which occu- pies the site of the ancient Roman palace where Claudius and Caligula were born. The stranger may now continue to follow the main street , or he may proceed r. by the 'Passage Abreye' (5 c.) , which leads past gardens , vineyards , and a number of fragments of Roman masonry, with explanations attached to them, which however are not to be implicitly trusted. This footpath leads to the Observatoire on the summit, not far distant from the church of Notre Dame de Fourvieres (PI. 25), which contains a highly revered 'miraculous' image of the Virgin (visited by up- wards of IY2 million pilgrims annually) and numerous votive tablets. The church is a modern structure, surmounted by a gilded statue of the Madonna. The terrace adjoining it commands a noble prospect, which is still more extensive from the tower (25 c). A more picturesque view, however, is enjoyed from the so-called ' Observatoire'' already mentioned , a small wooden tower (50 c. ; adjacent is a caf^-restaur.) in the vicinity, the route to which is indicated by sign-posts. At the feet of the spectator lie the imposing city with its environs, the two rivers and their bridges, and the well cultivated district in the neighbourhood; E. in fine weather Mont Blanc, 85 M, distant, is sometimes visible, 8 Route 1. LYONS. From Paris ffarther S. the Alps of Daupliine, the Mts. of the Grande Char- ; treuse and Mont Pilat, W. the Mts. of Auvergne. The Cathedral of St. Jean Baptiste (PL 41) on the r. hank i of the Saone, adjoining the Palais de Justice, a structure of the 13th cent., possesses sereral remarkable features, a fine central tower, stained glass windows, and a curious and complicated clock of 1508, resembling that of Strasbourg. The Bourbon chapel (1st on the r.), erected by Cardinal Bourbon and his brother Pierre de Bourbon, son-in-law of Louis XI., contains some fine sculptures. On the 1. bank of the Saone , about 1/2 M- lower down , is situated the church of the Abbey d'Ainay (PI. 24) , one of the oldest in France , dating from the 10th cent. , the vaulting of which is borne by four antique columns of granite. Its Latin name was Athenaeum^ supposed to be derived from the fact that Caligula once founded an Athenaeum^ or school of rhetoric, here. Beneath the sacristy are the former dungeons. In the Place des Terreaux (PI. 3), in which the Hotel de Ville and the Museum are situated, Richelieu caused the youthful Mar- quis de Cinq-Mars, who for a brief period was the favourite of Louis XIIL, and his partisan de Thou to be executed as traitors, Sept 12th, 1642. Numerous victims perished here by the guillotine in 1794, until the more wholesale system of drowning and shooting was introduced. In the Hotel de Ville (PI. 62), a handsome edifice of the 17th cent. (1647 — 55), the revolutionary Tribunal, under the presidency of Collot d'Herbois, held its sessions. This miscreant, who had previously been an actor, and whose perfor- mances had been hissed at Lyons, availed himself of this oppor- tunity to wreak his revenge on the unfortunate citizens. He was subsequently banished to Cayenne, where he died in 1796. In the Avenue des Martyrs (in the quarter Les Broteaux) a chapel has been erected to the memory of the 2100 victims who perished here during the Revolution. In the Palais des Beaux Arts, or Museum (PL 69 ; admission gratis, daily 9 — 3 o'clock), under the arcades of the spacious court, are some remarkable Roman antiquities, a taurobolium (sacrifice of oxen), altars, inscriptions, sculptures, etc. The Picture Gallery is on the first tloor.

Gallic weapons, vases from Athens, etc. — There is also a M\\isee d'Histoire I^^aturelle here , containing zoological and mineralogical collections. — Finally a Library. The second floor of the Palais du Commerce et de la Bourse contains the Musee d'Art et d' Industrie, founded in 1858; the specimens in illustration of the silk-cultuie are particularly in- structive (admission daily 11 — 5 o'clock). The Civic Library (PL 6), possessing 150,000 vols, and 2400 MSS., is situated on the bank of the Rhone. In the vi- cinity rises the bronze Statue of Marshal Suchet (born at Lyons in 1770, d. 1826), ^Duc d\" Albufera' , who once served as a mer- chant's apprentice in the adjacent house. Two new magnificent streets, the Rue Imperiale und the Rue de V Imperatrice , lead from the Hotel de Ville to the * Place Louis le Grand, or Bellecour (PI. E, 3), one of the most spacious squares in Europe, which was destroyed during the Revolution in 1794, but subsequently restored, and adorned with a Statue of Louis XIV. in 1825. The Place Napoleon (PL F, 4) is adorned with an Equestrian Statue of Napoleon I. in bronze, erected in 1822. Adjoining the E. side of this Place is the broad Cours Napoleon, planted with trees, situated between the Rhone and Saone, with the rail. Stat. La Perrache. The Places Louis le Grand and Napoleon, and the streets connecting them (Rue de Bourbon etc.), are the most aristocratic quarter of Lyons. Beyond the station, occupying the entire point of the tongue of land between the rivers, is the suburb Perrache, named after its founder (1770) and still rapidly increasing. The traveller may proceed as far as the point of union of the Rhone \\ and Saone (liji M. from the railway-station Penache; omnibus from the I 10 Route 1. VIENNE. From Paris rTlace de la Charite to the Pout de Mulatiere 25 c.) , where the rivers are ' separated by a breakwatei*. The different characters of the two streams are I here distinctly observable. The Rhone, a genuine mountain-river, is clear ! and rapid, whilst the current of the sluggish and muddy Saone is scarcely perceptible. Steamboats ply on both rivers. The starting-place of the Steamboats is near the Place Napoleon : to Avignon every morning in 7—10 hrs. , to Aries in 13 hrs. (fares 30, 20, 10 fr.). Stations Vienne , Tournon ^ Valence^ Avignon^ Beaucaire , Aries. Those whom time permits will find the steamboat-journey more entertaining \\ than the railway. The former distantly resembles a trip on the Rhine, I but the scenery of the Rhone is less striking, and the steamers ('papins') I far inferior. ' The Jardin des Plantes at the Croix Rousse has since the construction of the railway been converted into a square fnear it is the Place Sathonay with the bronze Statue of Jacquard by Foyatier), and is superseded by the * Pare de la Tete d'Or, on the 1. bank of the Rhone, at the N. extremity of the Quai d' Albert (1 M. from the Place des Terreaux), containing rare plants, hothouses, and pleasure-grounds in the style of the Bois de Boulogne at Paris. ^■^ The Railway to Marseilles (station see p. 6) crosses the Rhone, affording a glimpse of the imposing city, passes La Guillotiere (p. 6), and traverses an attractive district surrounded by mountains. Stations Saint-Fans, Feysin with handsome cha- teau on the Rhone, Serezin, Chasse, and Estressin. Vienne (* Hotel Omhry, R. IV2 — 2 fr. ; du Nord; Table Ronde, R. 2, D. 3, A. 1 fr.), the Vienna Allobrogum of the ancients, with a popul. of 24,800, lies on the 1. bank of the Rhone, at the influx of the Gere. Several interesting mementoes of its former greatness are still extant. The so-called * Temple of Augustus, of the Corinthian order (88 ft. long, 49 ft. wide, 56 ft. high), with 16 columns, and hexastyle portico, Is approached from the ancient forum by 12 steps, in the middle of which stands an altar. The edifice was used in the middle ages as a church and seriously disfigured, but has been restored as nearly as possible to its original condition. It formerly contained a Museum of Roman antiquities which has been temporarily remo- ved to the Hotel de Ville and will eventually be transferred to *St. Pierre, an ancient basilica of the 6th cent., disfigured du- ring the past century , but now undergoing restoration. Those who contemplate a visit to the temple and church should apply to the architect M. Quonin, Place St. Maurice 9. The works now in progress will probably not be completed for several years. — The * Cathedral of St. Maurice (between the temple and the bridge across the Rhone), commenced at the close of the 11th cent., but not completed till 1515, possesses a fine facade of the transition period. The interior is the most ancient part of the edifice. — On the high road, 1/4 M. S. of the town , stands an archway surmounted by an obelisk termed the * Plan de V Aiguille, which once served as the meta (goal) of a circus, The visitor to Nice. VALENCE. 1.

Vienne is not visible from the railway, which passes through a tunnel beneath part of the town. Immediately beyond the town rises the Plan de 1' Aiguille , mentioned above. The banks of the Rhone rise in gentle slopes , planted with vines and fruit-trees. On the r. bank, at some distance from the river, towers Mont Pilat f3689 ft.) , a picturesque group of mountains, at the base of which lie the celebrated vineyards of La Cote Rotie. The line continues to follow the course of the Rhone, at some distance from the river. Several small stations , then St. Ramhert (branch -line to Grenoble, p. 31). Ruined castles and ancient watch-towers are occasionally seen on the adjacent heights. Beyond stat. St. Vallier rises the Chateau de Vals, near which is the Roche Taillee. Farther on are the pinnacles of the Chateau de Ponsas, where Pontius Pilate is said to have resided during his exile. Stat. Serves; then Tain, where the valley of the Rhone con- tracts; on the 1. rises the extensive vineyard of Ermitage, where the well known wine of that name is produced. In the dis- tance to the 1. the indented spurs of the Alps are conspicuous, above which in clear weather the gigantic Mont Blanc is visible. Tain is connected by means of a suspension-bridge with Tournon, on the opposite bank , a small town with picturesque old castles of the Counts of Tournon and Dukes of Soubise. On the 1. a view is now disclosed of the broad valley of the Isere (ascending towards the Little St. Bernard) , on which Grenoble, the ancient Cularo, subsequently Gratianopolis , capital of the Department of the Isere , is situated. In September, B. C. 218, Hannibal ascended this valley with his army, crossed the Little St. Bernard and the Alps within 15 days, and during the same autumn gained the signal victories of the Ticinus and the Trebia over the Romans. Stat. Roche-de-Glun. The train crosses the Isere and commands a view of the snowy summits of Mont Blanc to the 1. To the r. lies St. Peray with its far-famed vineyards , on the limestone pinnacles beyond which stand the ruins of the Chateau de Crussol, once the seat of the Crussol family, Dukes of Uzes. Then, on the opposite bank, Valence (Lion d'Or; Tete d'Or, both of humble pretension; *Cafe Armand) , the Valentia of the ancients, once the capital of the Duchy of Valentinois, with which the infamous Caesar Borgia was invested by Louis XII. It is now the chief town, with 20,000 inhab. , of the Department of the Drome. The situation is picturesque, but there Is little else to arrest the traveller's attention. The principal curiosities are a few anti- quated houses, e. g. that of the Mistral family, termed Le Pen- dentif, near the cathedral, date 1548; another in the Grande Rue, 12 Route 1. ORANGE. From Paris near the Place aux Clercs, with quaint decorations in the style of the 16th cent. On the ground-floor of No. 4 in the same street Napoleon once lodged when a sous-lieutenant of artillery. On Aug. 29th, 1799, Pope Pius VI. died in captivity at Valence. His bust with basrelief by Canova is preserved in the old Ro- manesque cathedral. The Museum, with collections of art and natural history, is insigniticant. On the Rhone-promenade stands the monument of General Championnet (d. 1800j, the conqueror of Naples, who was a native of Valence. The town is connected with the r. bank by a suspension -bridge. Branch line hence to Grenoble (see p. 31) in 31/2 hrs. On the height above St. Peray rises the Chateau de Beauregard, erected, it is said, by Vauban in the form of a mimic fortress, now converted into a vast depot for the highly esteemed produce of the neighbouring vineyards, the reputation of which is hardly in- ferior to that of Champagne itself. Stat. LEtoile is picturesquely situated on the hill. Then Stat. Livron, where a branch line diverges r. to Privas. A short distance farther the influx of the Drome is observed on the 1. j the line crosses this river at stat. Loriol and again approaches the Rhone. Stat. Montelimart. The ancient castle of the once celebrated family of the Monteil d'Adhemar rises on an eminence from the midst of mulberry -trees. The line here quits the Rhone, the plain on the r. expands. The silk-culture has been successfully prosecuted in this district since the campaign of Charles Vlll. against Italy in 1494. About 12 M. to the S. E. is situated the Chateau] de Grignan, once the seat of the son-in-law of Madame de SMg7i4, burned, down during the Re- volution. The window at which the illustrious letter-writer is said to have sat is still shown. Mad. de Sevigne died here in 1696 in her 70th year and was interred in the neighbouring church. On the r. bank, farther on, lies the episcopal residence of Viviers , once capital of the Vivarais , with a conspicuous eccle- siastical seminary. The railway runs to the 1. in the plain, by Chdteauneuf, JDonzhres and Pierrelatte; opposite the latter is Bourg St. Andeol, with a handsome suspension-bridge. Next stat. La Palud; then La Croisiere, which is also the station for Pont St. Esprit on the r. bank; the long stone bridge of the latter, with 26 arches, was constructed in 1265—1310. To the S.E. towers the majestic Mont Ventoux (6813 ft.). Stations Mondragon, Mornas, Piolenc, and, situated 3 M. from the Rhone, the small town of Orange (*E6tel des Princes or Poste, R. 2, B. 1 , D. 3, A. 3/^ fr.), the Arausio of the Romans and once a prosperous place of considerable importance. In the middle ages it was the capital of a small principality, which, on the death without issue of the last reigning prince in 1531, fell to his nephew the Count of Nassau, and until the death of William III. (d. 1702), king to Nice. CARPENTRAS. 1. Route. 13 of England , continued subject to the house of Nassau-Orange. By the Peace of Utrecht, Orange -was annexed to France, and the house of Nassau retained the title only of princes of Orange. The antiquarian should if possible devote a few hours to the interesting Roman remains at Orange. On the road to Lyons, 1/4 M. N. of the town , is a *Triumphal Arch , part of which is in good preservation, with three archways and 12 columns. The sculptures are sadly defaced; their style appears to point to the latter half of the 2nd cent, as the period of their origin, not to the time of Marius or Augustus as has been conjec<^ured. On the S. side of the town, at the foot of an eminence, lies the *Roman Theatre, 129ft. in height, 355 ft. in length, with walls 14ft. in thickness (the concierge lives on the spot , 1/2 fr.). The ad- mirably preserved wall of the stage, from which an awning used to be stretched, still contains the three doors from which the actors emerged. The semicircular space for the spectators, which rises opposite , is in a much more dilapidated condition ; the tiers of seats have almost entirely vanished. The acoustic arrangement of the structure is admirable. Words spoken in a loud and distinct voice on the stage are perfectly audible on the highest tier. Scanty remnants of a Circus adjoin the theatre. The height above the theatre , once occupied by the citadel of Orange which was destroyed by Louis XIY., affords a good survey of the neighbourhood. The promenade is adorned with a statue of the Comte de Gasparin (d. 1862). Beyond Orange the line traverses a plain, in which olives begin to indicate the proximity of a warmer climate, at a consi- derable distance from the Rhone and the mountains.

The first conspicuous edifice, as the town is entered, is the hospital, with a statue of the founder in front. Hence in a straight direction to the Palai.% de Justice, the court of which (application should be made to the concierge) contains a small Roman ''Triumphal Arch of the 3rd cent. A. D. The sculptures on the side represent two barbarians bound to a tree, on which trophies are suspended. The frieze and attic are wanting. Adjacent is the late Gothic church of .Si^. Sdverin, the S. por- tal of which merits notice. The town is encircled by ramparts with agree- able promenades, in which (1. from the station) the Museum containing an- tiquities and paintings is situated. Mont Ventoux (p. 12) bounds the horizon on the E.

The town was once a Roman colony, afterwards belonged to the Burgundians, then to the Franks, be- came capital of the County of Venaisin, lost its independence to Louis VIII. in 1226, fell into the hands of Charles of Anjou in 1290, was the residence of the popes from 1309 to 1377, seven of whom, from Clement V. (Bertrand de Goth) to Gregory XL, reigned here (the latter transferred his seat to Rome in 1377), and continued subject to the pontifical sway until it was annexed to France by the Revolution in 1791. The town lies on the 1. bank of the Rhone , a short distance above the influx of the Durance, and is connected with Villeneuve on the opposite bank by a suspension-bridge. It is commanded by the abrupt Rocher des Dons (rupes dominorum), 300 ft. in height, which is surmounted by the Cathedral of Notre Dame, (PI. lOj, a structure of the 14th cent. , recently restored. The portico is of considerably earlier origin. The church contains the handsome *monument of Pope John XXII, (Euse of Cahors), d. 1334, and that of Benedict XII. (d. 1342) in the 1. aisle. Im- mediately behind the cathedral is La Glaciere, a square tower which derives its appellation from an ice-cellar in the vicinity; it once served as the prison of the Inquisition, and during the eventful month of October, 1791, was the scene of the exe- cution of 63 innocent victims. Near the cathedral rises the *Papal Palace (PI. 3), now a barrack, a lofty and gloomy pile, erected by Clement V. and his successors, with huge towers and walls 100 ft, in height. The faded frescoes in the Chapelle du St. Office were executed by Simone Memmi of Siena (d, 1339), Rienzi was incarcerated here in 1351 in the Tour des Oubliettes, at the same time as Petrarch was entertained as a guest. Opposite the palace stands the Ancienne Mairie (PI. 2, now Conservatoire de Musique), the mint of the papal period. The portal bears a relief representing flowers, armorial bearings etc. Pleasant grounds have been laid out on the hill near the cathedral. The best point of view is a rocky eminence in the centre. The ** prospect, one of the most beautiful in France, embraces the course of the Rhone and its banks; Villeneuve on the opposite bank with its citadel and ancient towers; in the distance towards the N.W. the Cevennes; N.E.

On the promenades is a statue to Jean AUhen , erected in 1846, out of gratitude to him for having introduced the cultivation oif madder, which now forms the staple commodity of the district (used extensively in dyeing the French red military trowsers). At the base of the liocher des Dons lies the Grande Place^ with a number of handsome modern edillces. In front of the Theatre (^Pl. 30) are statues of liacine and .Moli^re; the medallions above represent John XXII. and Petrarch. The neighbouring Hotel de Ville (PI. 24j possesses a quaint clock with figures \\\\hich >trike the hours. In front of it stands a Statue of Crillon (PI. 34), erected 1858. This hero was a scion of a Pieduiontese family who settled in France in the loth cent. ; he distinguished himself at the early age of 16 under the Duke of Guise, then under Francis of Lorraine, and above all at the siege of Calais. He sub- sequently became a Knight of Sf. John and an intrepid antagonist of the Turks. He died at Avignon in 1615. His motto 'Fats ton devoir' is inscribed on the pedestal of his statue. In the Rue Calade is situated the *Musee Calvet (PI. 26) (ac- cessible daily, custodian 1 fr.). The Ground Floor contains a line collection of Roman antiquities, reliefs and inscriptions j two monuments, found at Vaison near Orange, are especially remarkable lor their size and excellent preservation. On the First Floor is the Picture Gallery: 80. Lor. di Credi, Ma- donna-, 101. Eeckhoui , Crucifixion: 106. Jnn. da ImoUt, Madonna; three small pictures attributed to Holbein. The back of the saloon is exclu- sively devoted to works of the Vernel family, natives of Avignon (Joseph^ the painter of Madonnas, his son Carle and his celebrated grandson Horace): Madonnas and sketches hy Joseph; a Cossack hy Carle; ''Mazeppa hy Horace, in two copies, unfortunately retouched. — Also a collection of ancient and niedittval coins, statuettes, crystal, lamps, sculptures of the Renaissance, furniture (a collection of republican assignats), cameos, engravings, drawings, a beautiful ivory Crucifix executed in 1689 by J. Guillermin, etc. — The Library contains 80,000 vols, and 2000 MSS. In the garden at the back of the Museum a monument was erected in 1823 by Mr. Charles Kensall to the memory of Petrarch's Laura. Her tomb was formerly in the Eglise des Cordeliers, but was destroyed with the church during the Revolution. In 1326, when Francesco Feirarca, then 22 years of age, visited Avignon, he beheld Laura de Xoves, who was in her 18th year, at the church of the nunnery of St. Claire. Her beauty impressed the ardent young Italian so profoundly, that, although he never received the slightest token of regard from the object of his romantic attachment, either before or after her mar- riage, with Ungues de Sade, he continued throughout his whole lifetime to celebrate her praises in songs and sonnets. In 1334 he quitted Avignon for Vaucluse, travelled in France, Germany, and Italy, and returned to Avignon in 1342 (with his friend Cola di Rienzi), where he found Laura the mother of a numerous family. She died in 1348, bowed down by domestic aftliction. Petrarch lived till 1374, and long after Laura's death dedicated many touch- ing lines to her memory.

An Excursion to the Fountain.\" ofVauclufle may easily he accnmpli,'<hod in th»> r(nir.«c of an afternoon with the aid of tho Avipnon- Cavaillon hrancli-raihva\\ . Aftor several unimportant stations, the traveller arrives at L' hie fur Sorgur (in 1 — I'j-j hr. ; fares 2 fr. 70, 2 fr., 1 fr. 50 r.). Thence by carr. or on foot up the valley of the Sorgue , following its sinijo- sities towards Mont Ventoux , to the (3 M.) village of Vauclusc (Hotel de Laure). A footpath leads hence in '|4 hr. into the Vnudunt' ravine, a rocky gorge, above which the ruined castle of the Hishops of Cavaillon rises on the r. At its extremity the .scmrces of the Surgue emerge from a profound grotto, at one time in precipitate haste, at another in gentle ripples. This spot is mentioned by Petrarch in his 14th Canzone : 'Chiare, freache e dolcl acque.' Shortly after quitting Avignon the line crosses the broad bed of the often impetuous and turgid Durance, the Roman Druentia, which descends from the Cottian Alps to the Rhone. Olive-trees are abundant in this district. Stations Barbentane, Gravexon, and Tarascon {lintel des F.mpereurs . R.

On the opposite bank, and cotjnected with Tarascon by a bridge, is situated the busy town of Beaucaire (where an important annual market takes place in July), commanded by an ancient castle of the Counts of Toulouse. From Tarascon to St. Rdmy (10 M. , one-horse carr. for the ex- cursion 10 fr.). On the site of the ancient Glamiin, 'jj M. above the small town, are situated two interesting Roman Monume nts. One of these, 53 ft. in height, resembling the celebrated monument of Igel near Treves, was erected by the three brothers Sexttis , Lucius, and Marcus Julius to the memory of their parents. It is constructed of massive blocks of stone, and consists of three ditVerent stories : the reliefs on the lowest represent battle scenes, above these are garlands and tragic masks; the next story consists of an open double arch; the third is a circular temple borne by 10 columns, with two portrait -statues. This magnificent relic belongs to the time of Ceesar. Adjacent to it is a half rtiined 'Triumphal Arch, also adorned with sculptures (Victoria with a prisoner), which appear to point to the victories of Marcus Aurelius. St. Remy, which lies at the foot of the barren limestone rocks of the Alpines, was the birthplace of the celebrated physician and astrologist Michael Soslradamus (1503 — 66), who stood high in the favour (»f Catharine de' Jledici.

Guizot, the celebrated statesman and historian, son of an advocate of Nimes, was born here iu 1787. The town is surrounded by agreeable Boulevards, which terminate in the Esplanade, adorned with a handsome modern fountain-group (representing the city of Xemausus, with 4 river-deities beneath). The e.xtreniely interesting Roman antiquities are not far distant from the station. The stranger first reaches the Arena, or Amphitheatre {PI. 3), consisting of two stories, each with 60 arcades, together 74 ft. in height. The exterior is in admirable presei vation. The interior contains 32 tiers of seats (entrance on the W. side, where a notice indicates the dwelling of the concierge; 50 c), and could accommodate 33,(KlO spectators ; greater axis 148, less 112 yds., height 74 ft., inner arena 76 by 42 yds. The upper gallery is about '/« W. in circumference. The founder is unknown, but is con- jectured to have been the emperor Antoninus Pius, about B.C. 140, whose ancestors were natives of Xemausus. The four original entrances are still recognised. Doors in the pavement of the arena lead to the (modern) 'sou- terrain', the ceiling of which is supported by beams. In the middle ages the Arena was employed by the Visigoths and afterwards by the Saracens as a fortress. Extensive works of restoration are now going on, especially in the interior and the E. side of the exterior, as the Arena is still employed for the exhibition of bull-fights (but of a bloodless character). The next object of interest is the \"Maison Carrie (PI. 19) (the route to which passes the modern church of St. Paul) , a well preserved Temple (88 ft. long, 42 ft. wide), with 80 Corinthian columns (10 detached, 20 im- mured), dating from the reign of Augustus or Antoninus Pius, employed as a church in the middle ages and subsequently as a town-hall. The inscrip- tion is conjectured (from the holes made by the nails bv which it was for- merly attached) to have been as follows: C. CAESARI. AVGVSTI. F. COS. L. CAESARI. AVGVSTI. F. COS. DESIGNATO. PRINCIPIBVS . R^VEN- TVTIS., according to which the temple would appear to have been dedicated to Caius and Lucius C2esar, the grandsons of Augustus. The edifice is, how- ever, probably of later origin, as the style of the decorations points rather to the age of the Antonines. This temple was connected with other build- ings, the foundations of which still exist, and in all probability constituted part of the ancient forum , like the similar Temple of Augustus at Vienne (p. 10). It now contains a 'Museum of antiquities and pictures , of which the following merit inspection; '1. Xaver Sigalon ., Narcissus and Locusta experimentalizing on a slave with the poison destined for Britannicus (1824) ; 2. Paul Delaroche , Cromwell at the coffin of Charles I. (painted 1831); 74. Rigaiid., Portrait of Turenne : 38. Rubens, Head of a girl; 104. Titian, John the Baptist; 54. Greuze, Old woman; 27. Van Loo, Portrait of his mother: 112. Caravaggio, Portrait of a boy; 45. Grimoux, A young girl. Also antique mosaics, fragments of sculptures, numerous inscriptions, etc. The concierge lives opposite (1 fr.). From the Maison Carre'e the visitor should next proceed by the Bou- levards and the canal to the Jardin de la Fontaine, where the ^N u nij> ha e- um (PI. 28), formerly supposed to be a Temple of Diana, is situated. This fine vaulted structure, with niches for the reception of statues, has partly fallen in; it contains statues, busts, architectural fragments, etc. from the excavations which have been made here.
