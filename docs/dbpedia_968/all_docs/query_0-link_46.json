CARDUCCI A Selection of his Poems, with Verse Translations Notes, and Three Introductory Essays BY G. L. BICKERSTETH. M.A. (CHRIST CHURCH, OXFORD) WITH A PORTRAIT LONGMANS, GREEN, AND CO. 39 PATERNOSTER ROW, LONDON NEW YORK, BOMBAY AND CALCUTTA I9I3 i|?ji.#,X> y A.37?oo5 ,1 J Hi'i ;j I) ;) Y I i.M iVHIll /■ ■?*/ /O //y TO MY MOTHER WHO FIRST ENCOURAGED ME TO WRITE THIS BOOK PIREFACE My object in writing this book was to introduce to English readers a poet who (with the exception of our own Swin- burne) was certainly the greatest alive in Europe at the opening of the twentieth century. As a nation we are pro- verbially slow to appreciate the Hterary achievements of foreigners. During the last forty years Italy has more than once rung throughout its length and breadth with the name of Carducci; selections from his poems have been trans- lated into half a dozen European languages ; an exhaustive study of his Ufe and work has recently appeared in France ; there is, I believe, a Carducci Society in Berlin ; and yet it is doubtful whether at the present time as many as five per cent, of our own poetry-reading public are even aware that such a man ever existed. If this be a true statement of the facts, I do not suppose I need apologise for wishing to fill up a ^p (surely worth filling up) in the average English- man's knowledge of modem Itahan literature — a hterature which, even though Carducci is dead, can still boast that it possesses the most versatile literary genius now living. I have selected, therefore, just under seventy of such of Carducci's poems as I thought best represented his genius in all its aspects. Personal preference for this rather than for that poem has, of course, to a large extent influenced my choice. As to what were his masterpieces, I have also been guided by the opinion, as expressed in anthologies, of the poet's own countrymen. But several poems — ^notably the selections from Giambi ed Epodi — are included in this book for no other reason than that they serve to illustrate the various stages through which Carducci passed in the long course of his development both as man and poet. ' I have provided all the poems in this book with verse translations, about which a word of explanation is necessary. viii CARDUCCI Any one who ventures to translate Italian poetry must soon become acutely conscious of the truth contained in Dante's well-known warning: 'Nulla cosa per legame musaico armonizzata si pu6 della sua loquela in altra trasmutare senza rompere tutta sua dolcezza e armonia' (Convito, i. 7). It is hardly necessary for me to say that I do not put forward the translations in this book as in any sense an equivalent of their originals. That they were never so intended the mere fact that I have printed the ItaUan text en regard is suffi- cient proof. The ideal translator of poetry must not only be a poet himself, but must probably also be capable of writing poetry in the language which he is translating. And unfortimately the Rossettis of hterature are few and far between. Translation, however, may be practised as one of the useful arts by those who lay no claim to be them- selves poets. It constitutes indeed a very valuable addition to the equipment of the critic, besides being a fascinating occupation in itself. My versions of these poems of Carducci were not made for those who can read the ItaUan at sight. Written in the first place to satisfy myself that I understood the poet's meaning, I pubhsh them now in the hope that they will serve not as a substitute for, but as an interpre- tation of, the original to those imacquainted or only slightly acquainted with the Italian language. So far as my own knowledge and skill went, I have tried to render faithfully at once the substance, the form, and the spirit of the ItaUan. If my translations enable any reader, who cannot yet appre- ciate Carducci in the poet's own tongue, to come even a Uttle nearer than he would have done without them to the poetry of the original, if they stimulate him to study the original, then they wiU be serving the purpose for which they are now pubUshed. The three Introductory Essays are intended to help the reader to understand Carducci's place in the political and Uterary history of his time, as weU as to appreciate the poet's own point of view with regard to the theory and prac- tice of his art. The essay on the metres of the Barbarian Odes— a. subject which no book professing to deal with Carducci's poetry could whoUy omit — need not be read by PREFACE IX those whom the bare technique of poetical composition does not interest. Perhaps I ought to apologise here for attempting to keep so closely in my versions to the metre and rhyme-sequences of the originals. It would need a Tennyson or a Mr. Bridges to treat with convincing success some of the Enghsh imitations of classical metres {e.g. the Asclepiad) with which I have rather rashly experimented. My only excuse is that I did not know how else to give the EngUsh reader any idea of the metrical problems which Carducci himself tackled so successfully. The Notes to the poems have been made as brief as pos\"- sible, and are only meant to explain the more obscure of the literary and historical allusions with which Carducci's poetry aboimds. In this volume I do not profess to treat of Carducci in any other light than that of poet. Nothing is said here of Carducci the critic, the scholar, the historian, the archaeo- logist, the greatest Italian prose-writer of his time. Nor have I touched upon the man in his private relationships, a subject upon which his intimate friends alone possess any right to speak with authority. ' Carducci the friend, Carducci in the simplicity of his daily life, is known to few ' (so the Italian poetess, Signora Annie Vivanti, told a London audience only last month) ; ' and those fortunate few to whom were revealed the immense and ingenuous goodness, the strength, the humihty and purity, of that great soul, speak of him with broken voices, write of him with trembling fingers, remember him with anguish and tears ' (the Times, i6th May 1913). But at least the striking portrait which forms the frontispiece of this book will reveal to those who can judge of the character from the features that Carducci, besides being a great poet, must also have been a great man. Before acknowledging in a short bibUography my more general obUgations to previous writers on Carducci, I must here express my very deep sense of gratitude to two friends, Mr. John Bailey and the Rev. W. H. Draper, for the help they have given me. How much I was able to learn from Mr. Bailey, how invaluable to me were the encourage- ment and sympathy he gave me in my work, can only be X CARDUCCI properly appreciated by those who read his brilliant study of Carducci's poetry in the Edinburgh Review some three years ago, and the masterly translations from the Barbarian Odes which he published in the Fortnightly at the end of last year. For all his helpful and kindly criticism (especially of the essay on the metres and of my versions of the Barbarian Odes) I cannot be sufficiently grateful. Mr. Draper spared time to read through my proofs. His fine taste as a judge of poetry showed me where I could improve many weak translations, and for his suggestive advice on numerous points I here tender him my most heartfelt thanks. No translator, I imagine, is ever satisfied with his work, and I can only express regret that so many blemishes still mar what I have done my best to make a worthy interpre- tation of Carducci to English readers. I must thank Messrs. Zanichelli of Bologna for arranging to let me print the Italian text of the poems here selected from their copyright edition of Carducci's Poesie, and the Editor of the Spectator for permission to include in this book one of my translations which appeared in his paper. G. L. B. Marlborough, June 1913. BIBLIOGRAPHY I DO not pretend to have touched more than the fringe of the already vast literature dealing with Carducci.

LIFE OF CARDUCCI GiosuE Carducci was bom on 27th July 1835 at Val di Castello, a hamlet of the Versilia, Ijdng at the foot of the Apuan Alps in Tuscany, not far from the sea. His father, Michele Carducci, of an old Florentine family which had been settled for some time in the Versilia, was a country doctor by profession ; in politics a violent Liberal, having suffered imprisonment for taking an active part in the Romagnol revolt of 1831. Probably owing to political rea- sons he left Val di Castello, when his son was three years old, and settled at Bolgheri, a village in the Tuscan Maremma, where he remained for eleven years, a period called by the poet his ' triste primavera.' ^ In an essay on Manzoni,^ written in later Ufe, Carducci has given us a vivid account of his boyhood and of his father's method of educating him. This was decidedly unconventional, and was responsible for implanting in the boy's mind ideas and passions which characterised him throughout Ufe. Allowed to run wild about the countryside, he learnt to love his Italy with that absorbing devotion which inspired aU his finest poetry. When time permitted his father taught him Latin, his mother ' read to him Alfieri. He was further permitted to browse in his father's scanty hbrary, which consisted of translations of the Mneid and the Iliad, histories of Rome and of the French Revolution, together with Manzoni's I promessi sposi and Morale Cattolica. Love of the classics 1 Cp. poem ' Nostalgia' {Poesie, p. 597). * Op., vol. iii. p. 143. » Her maiden name was Ildegonda Celli. Her two other sons, Dante and Valfredo, were born in 1837 and 1841 respectively. Chiarinl calls .her • una donna di una bonti rara, che si faceva conoscere e apprezzare al prime avvicinarla ' {Mem., p. 76). A 2 CARDUCCI and love of liberty were thus instilled into his mind from the first ; but in the endeavour to make his son as enthusiastic a Manzonian as himself, Michele Carducci was not so suc- cessful. He would shut up the boy on summer afternoons with the Morale CattoUca and Silvio PeUico's / doveri deW uomo, and order him to study them. ' I hated,' says the poet, ' I hated those books with a Catihnarian hatred. To me they spelt mortification, solitude, loss of hberty, of air, of combat, hunger for great literature, a new Tulhan prison.' ^ From this time forward Roman Catholicism and Roman- ticism, which his boyish imagination conceived to be inseparably united, remained his hfelong foes. After the struggle of '48, in which the poet's father took an active part, the famUy settled in Florence, where for the first time it was possible for Carducci to go to school. He was sent to the Scuole Pie in that city, and took the usual course of six years in classics and Italian Uterature. He did so well that he went to the Scuola Normale at Pisa already with a great reputation as a scholar. Here he prepared himself for the teaching profession. His chief friend and fellow- pupil at Florence was Nencioni, who was as enthusieistic a student of foreign literature as Carducci was of Greek, Latin, and Italian. Nencioni introduced him to Schiller, Scott, Byron, and Leopardi. Even at this early period he had begun to write verse translations of the classics and poems in imitation of Horace, thus learning that command over the technique of his art which he was afterwards to turn to such good account in the Odi Barbare. He was, however, developing most quickly his powers of political and Uterary satire, finding at Pisa abimdant material on which to exercise both. The University at that place was paying the penalty for its past Liberalism, and any signs of free-thinking were mercilessly crushed out. All this tended to increase Carducci's animosity against the Church. He had already surrounded himself with a circle of clever friends, of a Uke mind with himself, among whom Chiarini was the most intimate. A letter to the latter, who had thought of coming to the Scuola Normale at Pisa, is a mixture 1 Cp. op., vol. cit., p. 145. INTRODUCTION 3 of humour and disgust at the education to be had there, the pedantry, ignorance, and narrow-mindedness of the teachers, ' questi viU oppressor! e castratori degli ingeni giovanili,' who refused to aUow a man to think. His political opinions are best illustrated by the amusing caricature of an inno sacro ' Al beato San Giovanni deUa Pace,' written at Pisa in 1856, in which occur the verses : — Libextk, indipendenza Paganissima Utopia Offendevan la decenza De la santa teoria, Ora stabile e fondata Su rEuropa incatenata. Guarda mo', Castelbriante ! La tua Francia toma a Die : Bonaparte e novo Atlanta A la cattedra di Pio : Fan da Svizzeri a San Piero I nepoti di Voltero.^ In 1856 Carducci was nominated Professor of Rhetoric at the Gymnasium of San Miniato al Tedesco. While here he published his first volume of verse, which showed little originality, being chiefly imitations of the classics. Yet much that is specially characteristic of the Poesia Carducciana may here be found in the germ, the sense of form, the hatred of emotionalism, the love of action, the fiery patriotism, and above all, the deUght in battle. ' I feel it my duty to fight, if I am touched,' wrote Carducci more than twenty years later, when excusing the republication of the Juvenilia ; and, while admitting the puerile nature of many of these 1 Independence and Pagan Love Of Liberty 1 Oh, hush, the mere Words are highly contemptuous of The Holy and Catholic Idea Of a Church fixed on the firm foundation Of servile Europe's humiliation. Look, Chateaubriand, pluck up heart I Your France is as Christian as it can be : Like another Atlas, Buonaparte Has become the prop of the Papal See : And the Swiss that guard St. Peter's chair Are mostly the progeny of Voltaire. 4 CARDUCCI youthful verses, he yet adds complacently, ' and these poems prove that I began to fight early.' ^ The book, chiefly on account of its frankly pagan sentiment, caused a mild sen- sation in the Florentine world of letters. To the criticism it eUcited, much of which was very sound, Carducci rephed with a series of burlesque sonnets. The principles of him- self and his friends at this period he summarises as being ' in politics, Italy above everything : in aesthetics, classical poetry above everything : in action, candour and strength above everything.' 2 Such principles brought him into direct conflict both with the Government and with the literary tradition of the day. His earliest Uterary polemic — the first of a long series — ^was undertaken on behalf of his friend Gargani in defence of classical traditions in Italian poetry against the contemporary poets of the Romantic school, of whom Guerazzi was the chief representative in Florence. With the literary was involved a political quarrel. The Government could hardly continue to over- look one whose persistent and unrepentant attitude to the time was that so pungently expressed in the last line of his sonnet on Metastasio,* where he had summed up the age as ' II secoletto vil che cristianeggia.' He himself saw it was impossible for him to retain his professorship at San Miniato, which he quitted, therefore, in 1857.* He was elected to an educational post at Arezzo, but the Government quashed the appointment, having perceived no indication that his views had changed. So he returned to Florence, and plunged into a mass of literary and journal- istic work, Hving in great poverty, haunting the libraries, and reading numberless books, which he loved to discuss with his friends.

INTRODUCTION 5 upon the poet's character. He felt his youth was over, and set himself sternly to the real business of life, which after his brother's death had at first seemed hardly worth living, but to which fresh ties were now soon to attach him. Ben io vivrd : ch6 a me I'anima awinta Di piii tenace creta ha la natura, £ officio forse e carit^l il suade. The love and duty here referred to were owed to a wife ; for after finally establishing himself at Florence he had married the daughter of his friend and connection Menicucci. This made no difference to his manner of living — he worked harder than ever — ^but it gave him a new personal interest in Ufe at a time when he sorely needed it. Meanwhile his poetic powers continued to develop, stimulated by frequent meetings with his friends in his own or Menicucci's or Chiarini's house, where they read together the classics and Italian literature, and discussed eagerly not only books but politics. War with Austria, which had been brewing for months, now broke out,^ and Carducci and his friends followed every detail of it with intense interest. Carducci himself burned to enlist, and would have welcomed the death of a Komer or Mameli. But duty to those who depended upon him for their livelihood kept him in Florence, and he was forced to find vent for his fiery patriotism as usual through his pen. Though hard at work for his friend the publisher, Barbara, incidentally laying well and truly the foundation of his vast erudition by editing the edizione diamante (reprints of Italian classics, to which he suppHed prefaces and notes), he found time to write the poems on contemporary events and persons that were now beginning to make his name known to a much wider circle than that of his immediate acquaint- ances. Politics had succeeded in awakening the poet's true self. His own personal enthusiasm now gave life and character, if not originality, to poetry, which had before been mere imitation. He and his friends published at this ' April 1859. On the 27th of this month the Tuscan dynasty fell ; and owing to Ricasoli's genius and perseverance the province of Tuscany was in i860 incorporated in the kingdom of Sardinia. 6 CARDUCCI time a literary and political periodical called II PoUziano, whejre his poems generally appeared. His 'Canzone a Vittorio Emanuele ' and his ' Croce di Savoia ' (which was set to music) were a great success. In January i860 he went to Pistoia as Professor of Greek and Latin, a post which had been offered him by Salvagnoli, the Education Minister of the new Liberal Government. It was just after he had settled at Pistoia that all the world heard of Garibaldi's Sicilian Expedition. Carducci wrote ' Sicilia e la Rivoluzione ' in Manzonian decasyllables. Da le vette dell' Etna fumanti Ben ti levi, o facella di guerra : Su le tombe de' vecchi giganti Come bella e terribil sei tu ! Oh, trasvola ! per I'itala terra Corri, ed empi d'incendio ogni lido ! Uno 11 core, uno il patto, uno il grido : N^ stranier ne oppressori mat piii ! ^ Mamiani, who became Minister of Education at Turin, wished to get him to the Turin Lycee, as a stepping-stone to a post in some Italian university. Much as he would have liked the latter, he preferred to remain in Tuscany. He really wished to return to Florence. On the i8th August Mamiani wrote to him offering him the chair of eloquence in the University of Bologna, and Carducci accepted. In Bologna he remained till his death forty-six years later. These forty-six years were an almost unbroken progress to the highest Uterary fame. In the poet's outward life, however, which is the regular one of a university professor, there is Httle that calls for special comment. From this time onward the interest of his career entirely consists in tracing the various lines of influence which converged to limit and mould his poetic genius. Though he did not take any active part in the closing scenes of the Italian Risorgi- mento, yet so intense were his pohtical sympathies that no event, however insignificant, occurred in those exciting times without his being intimately affected by it. For three years after his arrival in Bologna he kept silent. His * Cp. Poesie, p. 244. INTRODUCTION 7 lectures and all his new work can have left him scanty leisure to write poetry. But though he published Uttle his mind was maturing. It was a more fruitful period than it seemed. It is impossible to understand his development as a poet at this period without grasping what were his political views. In 1859, although his s5Tnpathies were republican, he had, hke aU good Italians, 'accepted the Garibaldine formula — Italia e Vittorio Emanuele — with- out any enthusiasm for the moderate party and its leaders, but loyally.' ^ Constitutional monarchy he considered to be in the abstract logically absurd, in practice immoral. It was a hybrid form of government, but he accepted, if he did not welcome, it as the best possible for the time. The course of events, however, in the next ten years induced him gradually to return to RepubUcanism with renewed ardour and conviction. The Peace of ViUafranca shook his allegiance to the House of Savoy. He was indig- nant, but kept silent. Aspromonte disgusted him. He wrote ' in a few hours ' ' Dopo Aspromonte,' ^ with its terrific onslaught upon Napoleon iii., which afterwards made even his Liberal pubUsher, Barbara, nervous of reprinting it. It became increasingly obvious both to his friends and the Government that he was no longer a Monarchist in anything but name. Yet it was not tiU after Mentana that he broke entirely for a time with the House of Savoy, and openly denounced it with scorn and hatred scarcely less bitter than that which he had poured forth on the Pope and Napoleon. Literary ambition had its share in this change of the poet's poUtical opinions. While in his own soul he despaired of emulating, as he had once hoped to do, the productions of Leopardi and Monti,^ he began to perceive that he might succeed to the position hitherto enjoyed by Prati and Aleardi, who had been 'considered the poets of the Liberal party, but were no longer able to satisfy the more fiery patriotism ' op., vol. iv. p. 148. (Preface to Giambi ed Epodi.) * Cp. Poesie, p. 340. » Cp. Lettere, pp. 68, 72. ' Di me che ho a dirti ? Che mulino sempre poesie in testa, e non scrivo mai un verso : per verissimo timore anzi disperazione che il f atto non risponda all' idea mia. Pur un giorno qualche cosa scoppier^ : e o sar^ un fiasco orribile, e allora addio alia poesia, o sarH qualche cosa.' This ' qualche cosa ' was the ' Hymn to Satan.' 8 CARDUCCI of the rising generation. This latter lacked all sympathy with the ideas which had animated the writers of Manzom s school. It cried for stronger meat. If Prati and Aleardi were not rightly to be labelled Romantics, yet they had all the f avdts of Eclectics, and could no longer voice the nation ; while Zanella, popular as he was beginning to be among certain classes, seemed with his \" po' di scienza e po' di religione ' ^ of far too gentle and melancholy a temper to suit the young Garibaldines. These hailed with delight Carducci's defection from the Monarchist camp. In 1865 he had written the ' Hymn to Satan,' and republished it in 1869 over the signature ' Enotrio Romano,' when it made him famous in one day. The poem is a psean of triumph, somewhat incoherent in places, celebrating under the name of Satan the victorious advance of the modernist Liberal spirit against the forces of obscurantism and reaction, represented by the Church and all monarchies.* Salute, O Satana, O rebelHone O forza vindice Delia ragione 1 Sacra a te salgano Gl' incensi e i v6ti ! Hai vinto 11 Geova Dei sacerdoti. These two concluding verses of the poem became the war- cry of the extreme Republican party, who now claimed the author for their own. These were certainly trying times for all good Italians, and it is not surprising that to Carducci of all men, with his passionate temperament and burning patriotism, the slow methods of diplomacy seemed the betrayal of a great cause. The Government, however, though they might allow for his feelings as a man, felt bound to reprove him as an official. In November 1867 they transferred him from Bologna, where his views were tumul- tuously acclaimed by the students, to the chair of Latin in Naples. Carducci replied with courtesy that he was not • Cp. op. cit., p. 143. ' Op., vol. iv. p. 89 (Polemiche Sataniche), for letter of Carducci to Filopanti explaining and justifying his poem. INTRODUCTION 9 qualified to accept a professorship of Latin, and that he preferred therefore to remain at Bologna. A few months later he was suspended from teaching, on the charge of a ' notoriously demagogical spirit ' and ' constant opposi- tion to the acts of the Government.' Fortunately for Carducci, who was prepared to defend himself with vigour, a change of ministry caused the whole affair to be dropped.^ In 1868 he published Levia Gratma, the first collection of his poems printed since the San Miniato volume. It con- tained no political poems, as he probably deemed it tactful at this particular juncture to omit anything that might further irritate the authorities. Consequently the reader finds himself here back again with the old Carducci, the literary imitator, unchanged save that he appears as a more practised versifier and gives some evidence of genuinely feeling the deep melancholy which pervades the book. ' In it,' said Carducci himself many years later, ' may be seen the man who has no faith in poetry or himself : ... in re-read- ing myself I judge myself to have been as one dead.' ^ In the circumstances, therefore, it is not surprising that the book fell still-bom from the press. Apart from his gift for writing political verse, Carducci was not able as yet to compete with Zanella in pubUc popularity. He was dis- appointed at the reception given to Levia Gramia, and when his friend Barbara offered to publish a collected edition of all his poetry up to date, he accepted gladly. The book appeared in 1870, divided into three parts, the first of which contained the political poems, under the title Decennali (1860-70), in later editions merged under the more general title, Giambi ed Epodi {Iambics and Epodes). These poems throb with a patriotic sentiment as noble and exalted as any that ever inspired Italians throughout their long struggle for liberty. But as poetry they are too often marred by the savage virulence shown in denouncing those whom the poet considered the arch-tyrants and foes of freedom, Pius IX. and Napoleon iii. Many fine poems are spoilt by • Cp. the Preface to Giambi ed Epodi {Op., vol. iv. p. 154). » Op., vol. iv. p. 142. ' Di questo volumetto che do a ristampare veggo e sento la livida screziatura e U freddo, come un pezzo di marmo che aggiungo a murare il sepolchro de' miei sogni di gioventii.' lo CARDUCCI a frenzy of hatred and blind passion of revenge, ' urli di furore e gridi di rabbia felina' (as one critic called them),^ which distort facts and aHenate the sympathy of the reader. Nor is his regret much diminished when he discovers that many of these extravagancies are not original but copied, sometimes even hterally translated, from Les CMtiments of Victor Hugo, whose influence was strong upon Carducci at this time.^ It was inevitable that Carducci's genius should outgrow the Sturm und Drang period through which he was now passing. He did indeed for many years continue to write political poems in the same vein as before ; for he was not satisfied even when Vittorio Emanuele entered Rome, and Italy was at last united around its ancient capital He had yearned for a glorious conclusion to the long years of struggle, and he was disgusted at the tame, even sordid, ending to the great drama of the Risorgimento. But other influences were beginning to work upon his imagination. Since 1862 he had been studjdng with industry German literature, especially Goethe and Schiller, Platen and Heine. With the latter especially he conceived himself to have strong affinities, and took to consciously imitating both his prose and verse style. Platen and Klopstock attracted him for the severe beauty of their classical forin ; while from the lyrics of Goethe, and especially Schiller, he learnt to feel the force, when under proper control, of the subjective element in romantic poetry, and first perceived the literary value of the romantic ballad. These influences, combined with two great bereavements which he suffered in the year 1870, wrought a gradual change in Carducci's spirit. On 9th November his Uttie son, bom in 1867, to whom he was passionately attached, died ; and in the same year he lost his mother also. Carducci had idolised this boy: 'All his joys, all his hopes, all his future were wrapped up in the child.' His mother, whom he tenderly loved, had died in old age. He mourned, * Cp. Chiar., Mem., p. 367. » Carducci weis also much influenced by Barbier. Cp. M. Jeanroy's Giosue Carditcci. L'homme et le poite, pp. 103-13, for an account of tiie poet's debt to Victor Hugo. INTRODUCTION ii but could not resent, her death. But the loss of his son he felt to be almost too bitter to bear. ' Some seem to think,' he wrote to Chiarini, ' that the death of a little baby three years old should be a tolerable sorrow. This is not true. Three parts of one's Hfe depart with it.' ^ Two of his most beautiful poems,^ that must have burst from his very heart, were inspired by this great bereavement. Consequently when in 1873 Galeati published a new volume of his poetry, under the title Nuove Poesie, the pubHc soon discovered in it a Carducci unknown to them before. ' In the Nuove Poesie,' says Chiarini, ' the poet was really himself with a definite and characteristic physiognomy, which could not be confounded or compared with that of any other. And in that physiognomy what various, new, and wholly original features ! What a wonderful contrast of sounds, colours, attitudes in that httle volume of lyrics ! ' ^ The book made a great impression, and brought its author European fame.* In Italy itself the criticism it excited induced Carducci to write Critica ed Arte, perhaps the most brilliant of his prose works, in which he completely reduced to silence those who had accused him of being a mere plagiarist. In 1875 ZanicheUi of Bologna, who henceforth became his authorised publisher, was entrusted with a second edition of the Nitove Poesie. Carducci was now at the height of his Uterary activity, which his amazing industry enabled him to combine with university lectures and constant hard reading. Pupils flocked to him. ' Can the young men of to-day,' says one of the poet's modem critics, \" reahse what Carducci was to the generation bom between '60 and '70 ? It is impos- sible : poUtical and social conditions, intellectual currents, exigencies, life are too much changed. . . . Can the yoimg men of to-day appreciate the pecuharly Italian frankness, the classical serenity, the patriotic ardour, the humane dignity of Carducci's work ? They cannot understand how 1 Cp. Chiar., Mem., p. 181. * ' Pianto Antico ' and ' Funere mersit acerbo.' Cp. pp. 148, 140. » Cp. Chiar., Mem., p. 367. * It was reviewed by C. Hillebrand in the Attgemeine Zeitung; by L. 6tienne in the Revue des deux Mondes. 12 CARDUCCI at that period he dominated all currents of ideas and seemed to our hearts to embody the very soul of the Fatherland.' ^ Study of German literature had sent Carducci back with renewed ardour to the Latin and Greek classics, and he was already meditating the Odi Barbare. In reading German he had been especially impressed by the value of the short poem in ballad form for presenting a vivid historical picture, and by the possibility of adapting ancient classical metres to modem themes. On i6th December 1873 he sent to Chiarini and Targioni for criticism the ode ' Su I'Adda.' In January 1874 he wrote : ' I wish to compose other odes of the same kind in similar metres — I wish also to com- pose elegies in hexameters and pentameters like Goethe. I do not see why what he accomplished in stubborn and untractable German could not be done in plastic Italian.' ' I am reading now in leisure hours the conversations of Goethe with Eckermann, and the Roman elegies, and this reading sends me back with my whole heart and soul to the great literature of Greece. When all is said, let us confess it, the world's greatest poetry is Homer, Pindar, Sophocles, Aristophanes, Theocritus. They are the extreme limits of the beautiful of the highest type, youthful, blooming, serene. After them comes the bent, the twisted, the old. We feel some wintry frissonnements, and deem them to be thrills of inspiration.' ^ In writing the Odi Barbare Carducci wished to create a literary revolution, to rescue poetry from the depths to which he considered it had sunk in the last two generations of foreign romantic influence. He con- demned Romanticism as an exotic, imported chiefly from Germany. It had introduced into the poetry of Italy a sickly sentimentaUsm, which clothed itself in ' lunghi meandri di versi sciolti o cadenzati intrecciamenti di strofe senza una cura al mondo del pensiero.' ' Essentially foreign to the blithe, pagan, simny spirit of the Italian, it ought to be banished for ever together with the priest, of whose pernicious doctrines it had been made the vehicle » E.

INTRODUCTION 13 by Manzoni and his followers. In leading a classical reac- tion he pictures himself as a standard-bearer storming the hiUs of art and planting there ' la bandiera garibaldina ' ^ symbol of the freedom — religious, political, intellectual — which modem Italy had wrested from the Pope and from the foreigner. The Odi Barbate were published in 1877, preluded by the exquisite little Sapphic ode ' Odio I'usata poesia,' 2 and opened by the noble Alcaic ' Ideale,' ^ wherein he sings of the new Hellenic ideal which was to inspire this hterary Renaissance. Carducd had not expected his book, with its metrical experiments, to be well received by the public. ' Sono cose che devon parer molto brutte ' ; and he was more than justified in his expectation. Chance had it that Zanichelli pubUshed Guerrini's Postuma at the same time as the Odi Barbara. The contrast between the two was too great not to be seized upon by the critics, who contrasted Guerrini's felice facilitcL with the strange and uncouth metres of the Barbarian Odes.* Carducci was neither surprised nor disappointed. The elegant immorality of the Postuma would have ensured Guerrini immediate popularity apart altogether from the high literary merit of his book. Car- ducci, on the other hand, was well aware that he had to educate up to his level a public which had for long been unaccustomed to read any poetry demanding the least intellectual effort for its comprehension. The Odi Barbare, however, steadily gained supporters, and gave rise to a host of interesting questions connected with art, metre, and so on. As time went on the critics were found to be objecting to them, not so much as poetry, but because they breathed a political spirit so different from that of the Iambics and 1 Card., Lettere, p. 182. 'Costui EUmseiq almeno non fu vile: egli continub nell' arte quel che i garibaldini fecero con la spada. . . . Costui, che non aveva mai combattuto una battaglia si tolse in mano la gloriosa bandiera del '60 . . . la piantb sur uno dei vertici dell' arte, sur uno dei vertici no, sur un colle.'

They were answered by Guerrini in Polemica and Nova Polemica, and by Carducci in Novissima Polemica. Cp. Chiar., Mem., pp. 383-4- 14 CARDUCCI Epodes, In other words, the gradual transformation of Enotrio Romano the politician to Giosue Carducci the poet was anything but appreciated in Republican quarters. Upon the publication in 1878 of the ' Canto d' Amore ' and ' L' Ode alia Regina ' the democrats broke out in unconcealed wrath against the author whom they had for so long con- sidered their own particular preserve. Even his friends were surprised at his ' Ode to the Queen.' But the explana- tion to any who had studied Carducci's development during the last decade was not difficult. His political views had long been mellowing. For with the increasing settlement of the country his interest in politics had naturally yielded to his interest in literature. He remained a strong Liberal, but became more and more reconciled to the monarchy, especially as its development along democratic lines was inevitable. In 1877 he had visited the Umbrian plain on educational business, and in that lovely district, over which the spirit of St. Francis still seems to hover,^ he had felt himself moved to write a song of love. — Salute, o genti umane affaticate ! Tutto trapassa e nuUo pu6 morir. Noi troppo odiammo e sofferimmo. Amate, II mondo h belle e santo e I'avvenir. — The ' Ode to the Queen ' was the outcome of this general state of mind, although his personal f eehngs towards her, as he himself was at pains to point out,^ had not a little to do with the genesis of the poem. She was a Saxon by birth, and acquainted, therefore, with Klopstock and Goethe and German literature generally. She was one of the few persons in the kingdom who had immediately appreciated the Odi Barbare.^ She was a beautiful woman, and had been kind to him. He was a gentleman, and thanked her in a manner becoming both to a gentleman and a poet. 1 Card., Lettere, p. 192. 'Fui ad Assisi : ^ una gran bella cosa, paese, citt4 e santuario, per chi intende la natura e I'arte nei loro accordi con la storia, con la fantasia, con gli afietti degU uomini.

' She is reported to have said : ' II Carducci 6 da vero il primo dei nostri poeti viventi ' (cp. op. cit., p. 340). INTRODUCTION 15 Nor had his political friends any real grounds for dissatis- faction. He had been ready to stand for Parliament in the Democratic interest in 1876, and his speech, ' Per la Poesia e per la Libert^/ may be found among his published works ^ — a proof, if any be needed, of the unfitness of a poet for politics. He himself, in the Preface to the 1882 edition of the Iambics and Epodes, states clearly enough his views with regard to political poetry in general, his own in par- ticular. ' Poetry,' he says, ' like that of the Iambics and Epodes belongs only to a period, and that a brief period, of Ufe when the artist feels and reproduces a fleeting moment in history, with which he is either sjmipathetic or the reverse.' And he adds that if the poet continues to write poetry in the same vein when the original inspiration has faded, he is simply posing and caricaturing himself. ^ Absorbed as Carducci was in his new experiments with ancient metres, he was almost equally interested in develop- ing that kind of lyrical-epic poem with which his name has been particularly associated, but the idea of which had been suggested to him, as has already been mentioned, by the historical ballads ^ of Goethe, Schiller, Uhland, and Heine. When disgusted with the course of current events, he had always been accustomed to seek and find consola- tion in studying the Past. The time came when it almost seems as if he thought that the Past was the only subject worthy the modem poet's attention.* German Uterature had taught him the possibilities of making the lyric an artistic means of reanimating dry historical facts. As historian and poet he was eminently quaUfied to try his hand at the « op \" oi iv p. 170. His poUtical attitude was weU described by him- self at a banquet given to him at Volterra in 1882, where he said : ' M' han Qui chiamato il poeta del ribellione : ebbene, io devo dire che oggx alia democrazia sono state aperte tutte le vie legaU e scientifiche: e nbelle sarebbe chi da qui innanzi tentasse opporsi al suo logico e necessano pro- eresso' (cp. Chiar., Mem., p. 249). » Carducci had once included the romantic baUad in his general condem- nation of Romanticism, but that was because he was reaUy unacquainted with it. Cp. Op., vol. XX. p. 425. _ > , ,, .. a j 1 « Cp. note to • Alia citt4 di Ferrara ' {Poeste, p. 1032).

The former, though comparable in some respects to Hugo's Ligende des Sitcles, revealed Carducci in quite a new light as a master of dramatic narrative ; and it must always remain a matter for regret that he never finished the poem. Qa ira was on publication as much misimderstood as the Odi Barhare. Critics assumed that political opinions expressed in it were those of the poet ; whereas Carducci had been particularly careful to eliminate the personal element, and to represent purely objectively a series of historical events, so selected, arranged, and condensed as to form an artistic whole.^ For the rest of his life Carducci may be said to have ' specialised ' in the historical poem either in baUad form or more usually on the Horatian model, recurring anniversaries of great events in Italian history being a continual stimulus to his pen.^ A new volume of poems, published in 1889 under the title Rime Nuove, completely vindicated his continued powers of writing rhjmied verse, which the second collection of Nuove Odi Barhare, pubUshed in 1882, had led some people to doubt. The Rime Nuove contained nothing but rhymed poems, and was prefaced by the brilliant lyric * Alia Rima,' which defends at the same time as it splendidly illustrates the use of rhyme.^ The versatility of talent to which the Rime Nuove, taken in connection with the two volumes of Odi Barhare, bore witness, won immediate recognition both in Italy and other countries. Carducci henceforth had an assured position among great European poets. His German translators included the novelist, Paiol Heyse, and the great Roman historian, Theodore Mommsen. ^ Carducci answered his critics in what Chiarini calls ' una delle sue prose piii belle,' fa ira. Cp. Op., vol. iv. p. 386. * E.g. on 20th September 1890-1-2 he published respectively ' Piemonte,' ' Bicocca di san Giacomo,' ' Cadore.' ' The ' Ode to Rhyme ' had been published as a ' Congedo ' to the first series of Odi Barbare. ' Volli congedarmi,' wrote Carducci, ' da' lettori co'i versi alia rima, proprio per segno che io con queste odi non intesi dare veruna battagUa, grande o piccola, fortunata o no, a quella compagna antica e gloriosa della nuova poesia latina' (Chiar., Impress, e Ricord., p. 262 ; also Preface to Odi Barbare), INTRODUCTION 17 The poet's life yearly became fioller and more interesting. Although he had paid his first flsdng visit to Rome as early as 1874, he had had time to see nothing but the Pantheon, Colosseum, and Baths of Caracalla. ' St. Peter's,' he said, ' I left to the Pope.' His first visit of any duration took place in March 1877, when he was accompanied by a friend who knew Rome well. His sensations were such as the occasion was well calculated to arouse in the heart of a man to whom the Eternal City was a symbol of aU the noblest ideas by which his Ufe and poetry had been inspired. He expressed his feeUngs in the two splendid odes, ' NeU' AnnuaJe deUa fondazione di Roma' and 'Dinanzi alle Therme di Caracalla.' To him Rome was the mother of Italy, the mother of the nations : — E tutto che al mondo e civile Grande, augusto, egli e romano ancora. After 1877 Carducci returned to Rome every year ; in fact, his election to the ' ConsigUo superiore deUa istruzione ' frequently compelled him to go thither on business. In 1884 he had begun to spend his holidays in the Italian Alps, and from this year onward wrote many poems on the scenery of the districts he had visited, his favourite resort being Madesimo. The last ten years of the century were as busy as any in his lifetime. In 1889 he published the Terze Odi Barbare, which was to be the last collection of his poems written only in classical metres. It contained the fine elegiac ' Presso I'uma di P. B. SheUey,' one hne of which, Sol nel passato k 11 hello, sol nella morte e il vero, seems to strike the keynote of the poet's final attitude towards art and hfe. The mood of pensive melancholy which it suggests — natural enough to a man of Carducci's views, who had been deprived by death of many of his dearest friends, and who was now himself entering upon old age — tinges all the poet's latest work. His poUtical evolution had by 1890 entered upon its final stage, and as usual the change is faithfully indicated in his poetry. Under the influence of his friend, the great statesman, Crispi, and prompted also by his keen hatred of B i8 CARDUCCI Socialism, he had completely severed his connection with the extreme Repubhcan party in order to become once more a Monarchist— this time a loyal one. The ode ' Piemonte/ pubhshed in July 1890, was mtended as a pubUc declaration of his renewed allegiance to the House of Savoy. It even contained a defence of Charles Albert, ' re per tant' anni bestemmiato e pianto,' whom the poet calls the Italian Hamlet. In the last month of the same year the Govern- ment responded by making Carducci a senator. Those of his pubUc who had obstinately shut their eyes to the gradual emancipation of the poet's mind from the extreme Radicahsm of his early days were furious at this — as they considered it— open defection. To the Romagnol youth, indeed, he always remained the poet of the Iambics and Epodes. But Carducci himself was fuUy contented with the wider Liberahsm to which he had fought his way. It enabled him to interpret the history of his country for the last fifty years with a large-hearted charity, which suited well the milder views he was now begiiming to entertain concerning other bugbears of his youth.^ His hatred of Christianity had never been more than a hatred of Roman CathoHcism. Even in his youth he had never extended it to the person of Christ. As long ago as the ' Canto d'Amore ' he had been willing to reconcile himself with the Pope ; and now that Pio Nono was dead, Rome the capital of a vmited Italy, and the Temporal Power destroyed, he could study with a relatively unbiassed mind, and even learn to appre- ciate, the real services rendered to the world by the Church. It was impossible for him ever to become a Christian in the Churchman's sense of the word. Hatred of asceticism, with which, rightly or wrongly, he identified the teaching of Christ, was too deeply engrained in his nature.* But he was a lover of great ideas ; and just as the study of history had widened his poUtical views, so it taught him the poetic value, if nothing else, of the Christian conception of the * He had begun to revise his sweeping condemnation of Romanticism as early as 0:884.

INTRODUCTION 19 Church. This seems an adequate explanation of the reasons which prompted him to write the famous poem on the Church of Polenta, the publication of which caused a greater sensation throughout the whole of Italy thsin anything he had ever written, except perhaps the ' Hymn to Satan.' Cer- tainly from one who not so very many years before had written ' In a Gothic Cathedral,' and whose Ufe had been one long attack on the Catholic Church, such lines as the follow- ing seemed at first sight to come strangely : — Salve, chiesetta del mio canto ! A questa Madre vegliarda, o tu rinnovellata Itala gente da le molte vite, Rendi la voce De la preghiera : la campana squilli Ammonitrice : 11 campanil risorto Canti di clivo in clivo a la campagna Ave Maria. Ave Maria ! Quando su I'aure corre L'umil saluto, i piccioli mortali Scovrono il capo, curvano la fronte Dante ed Aroldo. Yet it is quite clear that aesthetic rather than religious considerations prompted Carducci to write this poem, and a careful examination of the verses themselves proves that their beauty is due to the inspiration of historical and Uterary reminiscence rather than of religious fervour. How unchanged, as a matter of fact, were Carducci's feelings towards the Christian religion may be judged by the uncere- monious manner in which, with a brief telegram ^ to the Secolo, he put an end to all rumours that he was about to return to the bosom of the Catholic Church. The truth is that Carducci throughout his whole Ufe had been such an uncompromising partisan that when in old age he took to expressing his opinions more mildly, people were at first inclined to believe that the opinions themselves had altered. 1 The actual words of the telegram were : ' Agli scrittori del Secolo. N6 preci di cardinali, ni comizl di popolo. lo sono qual fui nel 1867 ; e tale aspetto immutato e impertnrbato la grande ora. — Salute, Giosue Car- ducci' (Chiar., Mem., p. 420). Carducci never believed in the divinity of Christ He bowed before Him as the ' great human Martyr.' 20 CARDUCCI As a matter of fact, the poet remained true to his creed of ' Italy for the Italians/ which had been the life-blood of all his poetry, mitil the very end of his career. His last volume of poems, published in 1899 under the title Rime e Ritmi, reveals him as a strong advocator of an irre- dentist national poUcy, and this in no party spirit, nor simply because he was the friend of Crispi. He honestly believed that so long as she permitted Trent and Trieste to remain in Austrian hands, modem Italy was showing herself incapable of rising to that high ideal of patriotism which had inspired the dead heroes of the Risorgimento. His wrath at Crispi's fall was not resentment at the defeat of a friend so much as grief at the thought that National Idealism was dead.^ The spirit which animates such lines in ' Cadore ' as Id vo' rapirti, Cadore, I'anima Di Pietro Calvi ; per la penisola lo voglio su Tali del canto Aralda mandarla. — Ahi mal ridesta, Ahi non son I'Alpi guancial propizio A sonni e sogni peifidii adulter! ! Levati, fini la gazzara : Levati, 11 marzio gallo canta ! — is identical with that which in earlier days had bade him urge on his ' patria vile ' to the capture of Rome. The ' Congedo ' of Rime e Ritmi seems to show that the poet felt that his poetical career was finished. And yet the sonnets ' In riva al Lys' and ' Sant' Abbondio,' composed just at this period, were, Chiarini thinks, as good as anything he had ever written. During the last years of his life honours flowed in thick upon him. Even his critics were silenced amid the general chorus of homage and applause which any new work from his pen was now sure to elicit. In 1895, on the completion of thirty-j&ve years' work in Bologna, he was given the freedom of that ' Cp. the poem 'Alia figlia di Francesco Crispi,' loth January 1895 especially the lines Ei nel dolce monile De le tue braccia al bianco capo intomo Scordi il memento vile E della patria il tenebroso giorno. INTRODUCTION 21 city and presented with a gold medal. Count Pasolini crowned him with a laurel plucked from Dante's tomb at Ravenna. In 1899 he had a stroke which practically de- prived him of the use of his right arm, and Severino Ferrari the poet, his favourite and most brilliant pupil, was per- mitted to help him in his University work. In 1901 ZanicheUi published the well-known one-volume edition of his complete poetical works. In this year, the fortieth anni- versary of his coming to Bologna, the students held a celebration in honour of him rather against his wishes. What pleased him far more was that the Queen, while leav- ing him the use of it, bought his hbrary, and thus ensured its preservation.^ In 1904 the Government voted him a pension of 12,000 lire. In the following year the premature death of Severino Ferrari, whom he had loved as a son, proved to be a shock from which the old poet never recovered. In December 1906 the King of Sweden sent a special deputation to Bologna to present him with the Nobel prize for Uterature. Two months later, on i6th February 1907, he died from pneumonia, following upon an attack of influ- enza. All Italy was represented at his funeral.^ II. THE POETRY OF CARDUCCI When men are engaged in a long struggle for hberty they are apt to allow pohtical prejudices to colour all their judg- ments, as ItaUan hterature during the last century dis- covered to its cost. It is perhaps true to say that no Italian poet, from Alfieri to Carducci, has escaped criticism, which, however much it claim to be purely literary in character, is not in reaUty strongly influenced by pohtical or religious considerations. In Carducci's case it has already been shown how his political evolution affected at once his own develop- ment as a poet and the attitude of his pubhc. Now that 1 After his death she also bought his house, and presented it to the nation. It is now known as the ' Casa Carducci,' and its garden is adorned with statuary symbolical of the various aspects of his poetical works. ' Florence offered him a tomb in Sta Croce, the Itahau Pantheon. But his family preferred to bury him in the beautiful cemetery outside Bologna. 22 CARDUCCI he is dead, and the events about which he wrote are already passing into history, it should be easier for the critics to approach their task in a more dispassionate spirit, and endeavour to discover what lasting merits the Poesia Carducciana, as poetry pure and simple, really possesses. Carducci himself recognised, as we have seen, that much of his work, especially his earlier political poetry, was only ephemeral. Yet, on the other hand, several of his poems — ' II bove,' ' Pianto Antico,' the Roman Ode, and some dozen others — have already won a permanent place in anthologies ; and his admirers claim that the vast mass of his later poetry, represented by the Rime Nuove, the OM Barbare, and the Rime e Ritmi, is destined to form an imperishable part of his country's Uterature.^ Nor can it be denied that, from one point of view at any rate, these confident predictions will prove correct. As a political poet, and as the inventor of a new type of verse, Carducci will undoubtedly always secure for himself the attention of the historian and literary student of the future. Pro- fessor Benedetto Croce has, indeed, already distinguished two periods in modem Italian literature, the first extending from 1865 to 1885, and the second from 1885 or 1890 to the present day.^ To the earlier of these periods he gives the name Carduccian, the later he calls that of D'Annunzio, Fogazzaro, and Pascoli. In these three poets and their age he discovers the greater finesse and intellectual subtlety; while to Carducci, on the other hand, he attributes the grand quality of sincerity. A man, then, who is big enough to dominate his country's literature for nearly a quarter of a century, who if he did not, like Manzoni, found a school, is at least the father in the Muses of many poets — among them two so eminent as Severino Ferrari and Giovanni Pascoli — ^whose historical odes are taught in all Italian schools, who earned for himself the title of ' Vate d' Italia ' * E.g. Mazzoni says : ' L'eterniti d'amore risplenderi su lui finch^ la sua poesia sara sentita, ammirata, amata ; e sar4, finch6 la lingua di Dante duri strumento di tutto quanto il pensiero e di tutto quanto il senti- mento del popolo nostro, dalle Alpi alia SiciUa ' (cp. Chiar., Mem. p. 431). * Cp. B. Croce's Letteratura e critica dell Letteratura contemporanea in Italia. Due saggi, p. 11. INTRODUCTION 23 in the most supreme moments of modem Italian history, will assuredly never be forgotten. But whether his poetry will be read in the future for the sake of its own intrinsic merit is another question, and one which, to judge from the tone of some modem critics both in his own country and outside it, will not perhaps be answered in the affirmative quite so imanimously as the jealousy of his admirers would desire. An attempt, therefore, to discover the characteristic merits and failings of Carducci's verse may serve to help the reader to form his own opinion as to the poet's trae greatness. Carducci's importance in literature is due to the fact that he introduced a new ideal into Itahan poetry. It is essential to define at the outset the nature of this ideal in order to avoid the error, committed by some critics, of blaming him for not performing something which he never set out to achieve. Carducci was one of the most outspoken of poets. He was provocatively frank both in his criticism of con- temporary hterature and in the statement of his own views. Caring nothing at all for pubUc opinion, he never wrote to catch a pubhc. ' Let a poet express himself, his moral and artistic convictions, as sincerely, straightforwardly, and resolutely as he can : the rest is not then his affair.' ^ Such was his attitude, and it should not be difficult to discover what these convictions were. They are summarised dis- tinctly enough in a letter which he wrote at a time when his disgust with contemporary hterature was at its height. After a very acute analysis of the genesis and the progress of Itahan Romanticism, he defines the need of the present age in the following terms : — ' We must make art realistic : represent what is real, in more natural terms, with tmth. We must do away with the ideal, the metaphysical, and represent man, nature, reaUty, reason, hberty. To that end unite study of the ancients, who are realistic and free. Homer, Aeschylus, Dante, and of the popular poetry with modem sentiment and art.' ^ If to this statement we add 1 Cp. Critica ed Arte (0/>., vol. iv. p. 285), where he quotes these words of his own. ' Lettere, p. 143. ' Bisogna fare I'arte realistica : rappresentare quel che 6 reale, in termini piti naturali, con la verity. Bisogna cacciar via 24 CARDUCCI the first three verses of his brilUant lyric ' The Poet ' we shall obtain a sufficiently clear conception of what Carducci set before himself as the ideal poetic figure for his time. II poeta, o vulgo sciocco Un pitocco Non k gi^, che a 1' altrui mensa Via con lazzi turpi e matti Porta i piatti Ed 11 pan ruba in dispensa.

It is obvious that, on its negative side, Carducci's diagnosis of the hterary maladies of his age was defined by that hostility to the Italian Romantics to which we have already referred.^ Because Romanticism indulged in the mystical and the vague, Carducci loved the real and the matter of fact; because the Romantic school was the school of the neo-CathoMcs and neo-Guelfs, Carducci stood for intellectual freedom and political independence ; because Romanticism was attracted by the eccentric ajid abnormal, Carducci aimed at sanity of thought and strictness of form. But, on the positive side, Carducci's poetic ideal resulted quite logically from the nature of his own personal character, from his views on the relationship between poetry and I'ideale, il metafisico, e rappresentare I'uomo, la natura, la realty, la ragione, la liberta. A cib accoppiare lo studio degli antichi, che sono realistici e liberi, Omero, Eschilo, Dante, e della poesia popolare, col sentimento moderno e con I'arte.' Cp. also the article ' Di alcuni condizioni della presente letteratura' {Op., vol. ii. p. 502), where he sums up the pro- gramme for a fresh departure in literature in the two words, ' innoviamo rinnovando ' — ' Let our innovations be renovations.' 1 P. 12. INTRODUCTION 25 politics, and from the fact that he possessed the true scholar's enthusiasm for classical literature His was an essentially practical nature. He was never troubled with doubts or questionings about life, nor did the great problems of modem philosophy interest him at all. He was a Hellenist who, finding this world lovely and good to live in, did not concern himself about the next. He loved hfe for its own sake, and if in old age he is oppressed by melancholy at the thought of death, it is not the melancholy of Leopardi's ' Shepherd of Asia,' questioning the moon Che sia questo morir, questo supremo Scolorar del sembiante, E perir dalla terra, e venir meno Ad ogni usata, amante compagnia, and yearning for an explanation of the secrets of the universe, but rather that of the Greek anthologist. Oh, tanto Breve la vita ed h si belle il mondo ! or of the cultured humanist, for whom the dark entrance to the unseen world is lit up by the calm radiance of Greek poetry : — A me prima che rinvemo stringa pur I'anima mia II tuo riso, O sacra luce, O divina poesia ! II tuo canto, O padre Omero Pria che Tombra awolgami. Hence he turns with relief, if not with contempt, from the barren speculations of the metaphysicians and theologians. ' The lazy fool, in hazy day-dreams rapt ' is no true poet, or at least not the poet for modem Italy. What the country needed were men who, far from wasting time and energy over the ' questions, the broods that haunt sensation insurgent,' would employ all the resources of their imagina- tion and insight in solving the practical problems of the national hfe. When a nation is coming into existence, the most pressing problems that call for solution are political. So far from divorcing politics from poetry, it seemed to Carducci that the poet had a most necessary part to play on the political 26 CARDUCCI stage — a part, moreover, which none but he could play, and which could not be omitted without risk of disaster to the State. The poet, he maintained, when contented to pass with the public either for a pitocco, the servile minion of a patron or a party, or for a giardiniero, the writer of pretty but shallow, and possibly vulgar, society verse, is miserably failing in the duties of his own high calling. The nature of these duties may be deduced from Carducci's ideal picture of himself as his coimtry's poet-seer. In Critica ed Arte, after dividing the history of poetry into clearly defined epochs, he thus describes the one at the close of which he himself was Uving : ' And lastly there are other ages less glorious, in which, the nation being in a state of transition to new political conditions, the poets whom I will not by ah archaism call true vati (seers), but who feel instinctively, like certain animals, a nervous uneasiness before the earthquake, begin transforming certain forms of art which are fully developed. These are the critical ages, when poets fight over their work with offensive and defen- sive weapons : and Alfieri writes the letter to Calsabigi, and Manzoni the letters on the dramatic unities and on Romanticism, and Victor Hugo the preface to Cromwell.' ^ Here, then, he defines the poet-seer or vate as one who watches the times, who, by the exercise of a sense of intuition pos- sessed by himself alone, perceives earlier than others the direction in which events are tending, and whose duty it is to warn and guide the nation in every crisis through which it may have to pass. It is the practical value of the imaginative faculty upon which Carducci here insists. The poet's function in his capacity of vate is moral. Him- self anchored fast to some great guiding principle — in Carducci's case the ideal of a united Italy — he must, through good report or ill report, and without respect of person or of party, perform the office of inspired prophet of his people, expressing for them in outbursts of lyrical passion the emo- tions they feel but cannot utter, and equally prepared with warning or reproach whenever, through ignorance or blindness or pride, they seem to his clear sight in danger of falling short ' op., vol. iv. p. 27S. INTRODUCTION 27 of their own highest ideals. For these reasons Carducci never feared the charge of being inconsistent in politics. The poet, as he rightly considered, has no concern with political consistency. ' I intend, and have always intended, to express by a process of psychological purgation, with the greatest sincerity and efficacy possible, certain fancies and passions by which my spirit is moved, and to represent them exactly with the momentary shapes and colours in which I myself feel and see them, not with the shapes of yesterday, to-morrow, or some other day, and not with the shapes and colours in which other people wish to make me believe that other people will be better pleased to see them, or in which other people may be able to see and feel some- thing similar.' 1 The poet, in fact, must be absolutely genuine, and if true to himself preserves a fundamental consistency that remains unaffected, however many times he may chjinge sides in the conflict of political parties. If personal characteristics and political enthusiasm were instrumental in shaping his poetic ideal, this was no less profoimdly affected by his instincts as scholar and humanist. His innate hatred of the vague and superficial, not only in thought but in the realms of art and criticism, increased yearly in proportion as the true scholar's attention to accuracy and thoroughness of workmanship grew with him into a habit. The sense of clearly defined form, the lack of which he deplored in poets of the Romantic school, seemed to him to be an absolute essential of the great poet ; and he held that it could only be learnt from the Greek. It was their power of treating romantic subjects with ' that great classical art which is of all time ' 2 that caused him to place Goethe and Schiller so high above the German poets of their age. He himself was never tired of apply- ing the principles of Greek art in the composition of his own verse, with the result that probably no poet that ever lived has composed so few slipshod lines or written his own language with greater purity of diction. But he loved the classics not only for what they taught him about beauty of form. That beauty was to him only » op. cit., p. 286. ' Letiere, p. 140. 28 CARDUCCI the outward and visible sign of the life and ideals of the ancient Greek world, to which he was as passionately devoted as the mediseval humanist himself. ' The ancients who are realistic and free ' — ^by this he meant that, in contrast with the prevalent modem opinion, the old Greeks considered hfe to be something worth hving for its own sake, not a mere vestibule of the world to come. Their thought was free because unfettered by dogmatic religions and unclouded by the vague abstractions of mysticism. Theirs was a concrete, not spiritual world, in which love was untinged by sentimentality, the virtues of the cloister unknown, and patriotic pride and manly vigour not yet superseded by the Christian quaUties of resignation and humility. Into Carducci's ideal of poetry there entered, therefore, a very definitely pagan element. And herein he differs from other so-called classicists, who have earned the name merely in virtue of their allegiance to certain literary forms and conventions. Carducci wished to make the content of his poetry classical also, to regard both man and nature (so far as modem thought permitted) from the same point of view as the ancient Greek poets or as those Latin poets who had modelled themselves on the Greek. By so doing he hoped to knit up again a literary tradition, which the Romantic movement in Italy had interrapted, but which he believed to be as distinctively native to his country as it was sanctioned by its antiquity and eternal youth. It was for these reasons that in his earlier work he employed every device of language and hterary reminiscence, not excepting even Uteral translation, to reproduce as far as possible both the substance and the atmosphere of the Greek, Latin, and Italian classics ; while in his later poetry he resorted more and more to his country's past, both in myth and history, as being the fittest of all possible subject- matter to inspire a patriot poet. So much having been said, it becomes easier to under- stand why his poetic ideal took just the form it did. We shall expect to find him as a poet banishing from his verse all intellectual vapouring, meaningless abstractions, and vague emotionalism— suppressing, in fact, the subjective INTRODUCTION 29 element 1 in poetry, as far as may be, altogether in order to concentrate his efforts on the objective presentation of Hfe as it really is, in its beauty and ugliness, its joy and sorrow. If he is true to his own theories, we shall expect to find him pouring, as it were, the ancient Greek and ItaUan ideals into moulds of thought and language modelled, as closely as a sympathetic study of the classics can make them, upon those used by the ancient Greek and Italian poets. And, finally, we shall expect to find in him one who, by the true poet's gift of prophetic intuition, knows how to point his countrymen towards the glorious destiny that his ardent patriotism has imagined for them, while guiding, comforting, and exhorting them in their efforts to reach it. If all this be summed up in his own words as the ' repre- sentation of reality with truth,' study of his poetry will reveal the fact that few men have more honestly put their own principles into practice. Carducci's conception of reality, considered from the artistic point of view, controls his treatment of aU the chief themes of his poetry, as will at once become apparent if we examine any of these at all closely. Man, Nature, and Liberty, for instance — ^he held it incumbent upon the poets of his own time to deal mainly with these three, and they constitute accordingly a large portion of the subject-matter of his own verse. How are they treated according to the canons of Carduccian realism ? If we consider first the human element in his poems, it will be found that he eschews all abstract reasoning about mankind as such. Mankind, to Carducci, meant simply individual men and women. These men and women, moreover, are not creations of the poet's own brain, like Browning's ' Cleon, Norbert, and the fifty.' We find in Car- ducci's poetry no long reflective monologues, no dramatic ' Carducci considered the most characteristic mark of Romanticism to be the exaltation of the io. Cp. Op., vol. x. p. 286. ' La nota piii sicura a cui liconoscere il romanticismo quale prevalse dal Rousseau in poi k, non la msilinconia, non il ravvivamento del misticismo religioso piii o meno ciistiano, non I'imitazione del medio evo e generalmente della poesia settentrionale, ma il predominio della personalita, deU' io indipendente da qualcosa piii che le regole e le consuetudini nella mutevole libertEt delle impressioni e delle espressioni, I'esaltazione dell' io, la morhositi dell' io.' 30 CARDUCCI lyrics, in which the inmost working of the human mind is revealed, and the hidden springs of action are traced to their source. On the contrary, it is the action itself, not the psychological dissection of the mind of the agent, which interests Carducci. Consequently the men and women that move across his pages are not there to illustrate his reading of human nature ; they are not t5^es but indi- viduals, considered purely from the outside, objects of his respect, his hatred, or his admiration for something they have done or suffered in real life. They are, as already said, not created by his imagination at all, but contem- poraries of himself or persons famous in pohtical or literary history. Life, as lived in his own day or in past ages, teemed with poetic figures, ready to the poet's hand : men like Carlo Alberto, ' the Italian Hamlet ' ; Garibaldi and Napoleon iii. ; women like Marguerite of Savoy and Elizabeth, Empress of Austria. To be realistic, according to Carducci, is to take advantage of such historical figures as these, rather than to feed the fancy on the joys and sorrows of beings whom that fancy has itself created. Nor do the demands of realism end with the selection of subject ; treat- ment must be realistic also. At this point Carducci the historian and Carducci the opponent of Romanticism join hands. No veil of romance must be spread by the poet over the personalities with which he deals. Imagination, which tends to idealise men out of all relation to humanity as it really exists, must be strictiy controlled by historical fact. Yet Carducci did not believe that a man, simply be- cause historical, is of necessity a good subject for a poem. A man's career or character, to admit of poetic treatment, must be raised by some element of tragedy, beauty, or romance above those of the common herd. It is the duty of the poet as artist to isolate such figures in life or history as are suitable to his purpose from the milieu in which they occur, and then present them as graphically and truthfully as he can. For where the romantic element is a matter of historical fact, there is no need for the poet to invent it. On the other hand, it generally happens that the poet alone can disentangle that element from essentially prosaic ones by INTRODUCTION 31 which it is obscured. Carducci therefore is realistic, because he insists that if the romance is not there the poet must not imagine it ; he is an idealist, in so far as he perceives that though facts (t^ yev6/ieva) be his subject-matter, his art must confine itself to those facts only which are in them- selves instinct with poetry.^ What such facts may be it is for the poet alone to say. A poem like ' At the Station on an Autumn Morning ' shows, at any rate, that Carducci, without falling away for an instant from his own high standard of poetic form, yet lacked none of the ability — which the modem realist is apt to consider peculiarly his own — to unearth poetry in apparently altogether prosaic material. Carducci, then, felt that the more realistic, in the sense of truer to history, a poet shows himself to be, the greater will be the appeal of his poetry, just because it is true. And this was a consideration which in his character of poet-seer, with a moral function to perform, he could not afford to neglect. Consequently his men and women are not only historical characters, and hence obviously true from one point of view, but they are drawn with realistic touches either of person or setting, which serve to bring the man or the scene very vividly before us, and by their truth to fact and locality convince our reason at the same time as they stimulate our emotion. Take, for instance, the picture of Garibaldi retreating from Mentana : — II dittatore, solo, a la lugubre Schiera d'avanti, rawolto e tacito Cavalca : la terra e 11 cielo Squallidi, plumbei, freddi intomo. Del suo cavallo la p&ta udivasi >■ Guazzar nd fango : dietrp s'udivano Fassi in cadenza e sospiri De' petti eroici ne la notte.* This is realistic, and it is poetry. The poetry consists in the ' Cp. Arist., De art. poet., ix. 9. ' Even if he (the poet) chances to take a historical subject,, he is none the less a poet; for there is no reason why some events that have actually happened should not conform to the law of the probable or possible, and in virtue of that quaUty in them he is their poet or maker ' (Butcher's translation). ' Cp. p. 220. 32 CARDUCCI historical truth of the picture, both subject and treatment. Garibaldi, the hero of the nation : fighting to win Rome, the ideal of the nation : retiring defeated because unsupported by the Government of the nation ! Here is no figment of the poet's brain but a tragic fact. The poem focuses and embodies for all time the storm of outraged patriotism which swept over Italy after the battle of Mentana. The realism of Carducci's descriptive touches intensifies but does not create the tragedy. Again, to quote the last two matchless verses of the Alcaic ode ^ on the death of the Prince Imperial : — Sta nella notte la corsa Niobe Sta suUa porta donde al battesimo Le usciano i figli, a le braccia Fiera tende su '1 selvaggio mare : E chiama, chiama, se da rAmeriche, Se di Britannia, se da I'arsa Africa Alcun di sua tragica prole Spinto da morte le approdi in seno. Does not the tragedy of this wonderfvd picture gain immensely in effect from the fact of its historic truth ? The mother of the Napoleons mourning for her children ! How much less poignant would have been the haunting pathos of that ' chiama, chiama ' had Letizia never lived but in the imagination of the poet, or had her offspring been just ordinary children and not Napoleons ! If this is what Carducci means by representing reality with truth in his treatment of humanity, we shall find a still clearer instance of his apphcation of the same prin- ciple when he deals with Nature. He loved Nature ; but for him the word had no abstract significaition. He con- structed no reUgion of Nature like Wordsworth or Meredith ; he made no allegories about her like Shelley ; he had not the naturalist's knowledge of her that Tennyson possessed. Nature for him meant primarily the country as opposed to the artificiality of the town — the mountains, the sea, the sky, and all the beautiful and familiar scenes of country life. But he does not describe the country in general. ' Cp. p. 216. INTRODUCTION 33 Never having travelled abroad, he identifies Nature with the Italian landscape ; nor is it even the Italian landscape in general, but limited in much of his poetry to the scenery of the Maremma and the Versilia, in the midst of which he had been brought up, and which he loved to revisit. When in later life he took to spending his hohdays in the Italian Dolomites, this district also comes in for its due share of attention, though his descriptions of it lack the spontaneous charm that breathes from every verse of a poem hke ' Davanti San Guido.' The point, however, to be empha- sised is that the country he paints in his poetry is always real. It actually exists apart from his imagination. In- deed, the accuracy of the descriptions in many of his poems — ' Piemonte,' for instance — errs not infrequently on the side of being too photographic, and at times even smacks a little of the guide-book. But Carducci felt that the natural beauty of Italy, like the poetry of such a career as Garibaldi's, needs the adornment of no romantic colouring. His principle was to use his eyes, not to read into Nature what was not there, but to describe what he saw with exactness and sympathy. Just as the reader can never appreciate the true beauty of such a poem as Browning's ' Englishman in Italy ' except by visiting Sorrento and Amalfi, so he must have travelled in the Tuscan Maremma, walked through the Versiha, or wandered among the moun- tains round Cadore to realise how convincingly Carducci has caught and expressed the poetry of his native land. He tends to become conventional, however, the moment he attempts to describe what he has not seen. Thinking of Nature always as she appears in certain localities known to himself, he could not give verisimilitude to a purely ideal landscape.^ What is particular and matter of fact in Nature appeals to him. He has been called VirgiHan in his treat- ment of Nature, but he has none of Virgil's haunting sense of the mysterious power shadowed forth in natural pheno- » This accounts for the literaxy atmosphere of the Sicilian landscapes in the ' Primavere Helleniche' (Dorica) (cp. p. 156), which is comparable to the literary landscape of Tennyson's ' Lotus-Eaters ' or Virgil's Eclogues. Had Carducci visited Sicily we should have had something much more r^eilistic. 34 CARDUCCI mena. He is Virgilian only in his affection and reverence for simple country scenes and rustic pursuits. The figures of man and beast at work in the fields, illustrating what he so happily calls ' La giustizia pia del lavoro,' ^ as opposed to the unnatural conditions under which labour is pursued in great cities, never fail to make instant appeal to his imagina- tion. He loves, hke Virgil, to sing Wheat and woodland. Tilth and vineyard, hive and horse and herd. Over and over again his poems bear convincing testimony to the intimate sympathy he felt with all the homely details of the peasant's Ufe. Characteristic scenes and incidents of the Italian countryside are drawn with such a sure and vivid touch that even a single line or phrase frequently contains a complete picture ; while the moral symboUsm of toiling cattle or changing season is expressed (as in ' II bove ' and ' Canto di Marzo ') with g, grave simphcity a:nd power, which recall Millet in painting, but to which it would be hard to find a parallel in the whole range of modem poetry. It is interesting, further, to observe how characteristically Carducci's attitude towards Nature is affected by his patriotism. Many of his finest descriptions of ItaUan scenery occur in poems deahng with historical events and personages. He does not, however, simply make use of landscape as the cadre or setting for the historical and literary associations which must of necessity attach them- selves to almost every square yard of an ancient country like Italy, and which it was his special dehght, as a historian and archaeologist, to discover. His love of Nature and his love of history are really only two different manifestations of a deeper emotion stUl, his love of country ; and patriotism enables him to combine the two in the description of a paessaggio storico in such a way as to give equal effect to both. Thus in the historical ode ' Cadore ' ^ the poet's patriotism forms an emotional bond between the beauty of the mountain scenery and the heroism of Pietro Calvi's 1 In ' La Madre \" (cp. p. 238). a Translated, p. 267. INTRODUCTION 35 deed. Pelmo and Antelao are pictured as sympathising with the band of patriots fighting below them. For the mountains are Italy, and Pietro Calvi was fighting for Italy ; and it is because Carducci loves Italy that not only the natural beauty but the historical associations of Cadore appeal to him so forcibly. Consequently it is in deference to no mere literary convention that Carducci is led to personify Italy. He feels that she really is his motker, and he adores her with a filial affection. It is she who has given him, as she gave them to Dante before him, L'abito fiero e lo sdegnoso canto E 11 petto ov' odio e amor mai non s'addorme. She is the bond that unites aU the many nations that have ever called themselves Italian ; all the poets who have ever stmg her praises; aH the patriots who ' for her sake have fallen' ; aU those 'who for her sake shall live.' His love for her makes it easy and natural for him to pass from describ- ing her beauty, as seen in mountain, stream, and sky, to reminiscence of her people and her history. He visits Sirmio,^ for instance, and the peninsula suggests memories of Catullus, Virgil, and Dante ; they are indeed histori- cally connected with the locality, but Carducci's interest in the place is not merely archaeological. The real link between the three poets and himself is the common affection which all have cherished for ' Italia bella,' ' Italia madre.' Sirmio, with its lovely scenery, is the outward and visible object by which this common affection is symbolised, and as such has a message for the poet which the archaeologist would have missed. The best example of this intermingling of Nature- description and historical reminiscence is afforded by the ' Alle fonti di Clitumno,' ^ one of the most characteristically Carduccian (for this reason) of all Carducci's poems. He there exclaims : — A pie de i monti e de le querce a Tombra Co' fiumi, O Italia, h, de' tuoi carmi il fonte. Carducci believed this with his whole soul, just because his 1 Cp. p. 212. ' Cp. p. 204. 36 . CARDUCCI intense patriotism saw in mountains, trees, and rivers not merely beautiful natural objects but his Mother Italy ; and to him they were doubly a source of poetry, since besides their own intrinsic loveliness he looked upon them as Hnks with the Past, beings whom he could compel by sheer force of learned imagination to speak to him of aU the wonderful events of which they had been witnesses. Turning now to Carducci's treatment of Liberty, a theme which for a hundred years had more than any other inspired Italians to be poets, we shall find him as careful as ever not to lose touch with concrete reality. Of all his earlier poetry Liberty may be said to have been the dominating theme. It never ceased to be one of his main sources of inspiration. But if we are to call him a poet of Liberty, we must use the title in a very differ- ent sense to that in which he himself conferred it upon SheUey. The author of the Prometheus Unbound pursues Liberty as an abstract ideal, fashioned after a pattern laid up in heaven, and only dreams of it as whoUy realisable in some paradise of the poet's imagination. Such a Platonic conception as this Carducci would have speedily banished 'tra le fantasmagorie di un mondo impossibile.' It partook far too much of the romantic and mystical; whereas his own ideal of the free citizen in the free state presented a practical end, clearly conceived and capable of very definite statement. That practical end was neither the liberation of the human soul nor of the world in general, but the freedom of Italy. As an ideal to be fought for, it calls up visions of the battles and heroes of the Eisorgi- mento, of Pisacane, the brothers Cairoli, and above all. Garibaldi ; as an ideal to be realised, it simply means the Tricolour fijTing over Rome. Not until Rome is free and the Papacy overthrown does his conception of Liberty at aU widen its scope ; and the poet, with the history of ancient Rome in his mind, dreams of a time when the capital of united Italy shaU once more become the central source of aU principles of freedom and justice throughout the world.^ 1 Cp. op., vol. i. p. 23 (' Lo Studio di Bologna ').

It was obvi- ously impossible for him, holding the opinions he did, to be a love-poet in the ordinary sense of the term. Much of modem love-poetry is essentially romantic. It springs from the idealisation of woman. The lover endows his mistress, whether she possesses them or not, with every imaginable grace and virtue, and sets her on a pedestal, from which, Hke a deity, she is permitted to influence his life for good or bad. Carducci, as Professor Croce has pointed out,2 removes Love from this central position in Hfe ; and he does so by rehumanising woman. He brings her down from her pedestal, and transforms her again into a creature of flesh and blood. With a healthy naturalism which is never coarse, he loves, hke Walt Whitman, to dweU upon the mere physical attractiveness of a beautiful woman. nali, perche non potrebbe cMamar questa eti. a ricevere ne' nuovi ideali politici, dei quali irrequietamente ella va in traccia, quanto del diritto pubblico romano non fu di dispotismo imperiale ?
