During the succeeding hundred years or so, the Muslim conquerors threatened continental southern Italy with their raids and even established some permanent settlements at Garigliano, Agropoli and Bari. However, by the early 11th century, the Muslims had lost all their territory in Southern Italy, although they still held the island of Sicily . On the other hand, Byzantium then controlled the whole of Puglia [Apulia], the land of Otranto, and the major part of Calabria in continental southern Italy. A Papal bull dated 1024, organising the ecclesiastical province of Canosa-Bari, shows that the Byzantines held Bari, Canosa, Meduno, Giovenazzo, Melfi, Rubo, Trani, Canne, Minervino, Aquatecta, Montemelo, Lavello, Cisterna, Bitalbi, Salpi, Conversano, Polignano, and Ecatera at that date . Two charters dated 1003 and 1005 show that Venosa was also held by the Byzantines . Liudprand, describing the ecclesiastical province of Otranto, names Otranto, Turcico, Gravina, Matera and Tricarico as Byzantine possessions . Taranto, Brindisi and Acerenza were also Byzantine territory in the early 11th century . At that time, the Lombard principalities and duchies of Benevento, Salerno, Capua, Naples, Amalfi and Gaeta still existed in southern Italy, see the document SOUTHERN ITALY (1), but in a weakened state.\n\nThe first rebellion against the Byzantine rulers in southern Italy was led by Melus in [1009/10]. He was defeated in [1017] and sought help from Emperor Heinrich II, who created him duke of Apulia but does not appear to have intervened at that time with practical help. The family of Melus is shown in Chapter 1 of the present document. The Chronica Monasterii Casinensis and Amatus both record the arrival in southern Italy around the same time from Normandy of five brothers, Gilbert, Rainulf, Asclettin, Osmond and Rodolphe, who supported Melus in his rebellion . The family of these brothers in shown in the sub-chapter dealing with the Conti di Aversa, in the province of Campania, in the document SOUTHERN ITALY (2). Orderic Vitalis records that one of the brothers, Osmond, was the first Norman to settle and that he was granted \"oppidum\" by \"principe Beneventanorum\", although the report is a little garbled on points of detail . However, their expedition may not have represented the first intervention of the Normans in the affairs of southern Italy: Guillaume of Jumièges records that Turstinus cognomento Scitellus was the leader of primus Apuliensibus Normannis who were Waimalchi ducis Salernii stipendarii . No further details of this expedition have been found. Nor has it been ascertained whether at that time any of the visitors settled permanently in southern Italy and left descendants. Guillaume of Jumièges records that, after the death of Turstinus cognomento Scitellus, Normanni principes chose Ranulfum et Richardum as their leaders . The former is identified as the brother of Osmond Drengot.\n\nA second wave of arrivals from Normandy in the mid-1030s included the sons of Tancred de Hauteville who emerged as leaders of the Norman immigrants. Orderic Vitalis names Turstinus cognomento Citellus et Ragnulfus, Richardus Anschetilli de Quadrellis filius, filii...Tancredi de Alta-Villa: Drogo...atque Umfridus, Willermus et Hermannus, Rotbertus cognomento Wiscardus et Rogerius et sex fratres eorum, Willermus de Monsteriolo et Ernaldus de Grentemaisnilio among those who left Normandy and settled in Apulia , although it is unlikely that all these individuals arrived at the same time (particularly the sons of Tancred de Hauteville who, as can be verified from other primary sources, arrived in two waves). Tancred´s son, Guillaume, was elected count in Sep 1042 , as the vassal of Guaimar IV Principe di Salerno who was named \"Duke of Apulia and Calabria\" in charters dated between Jan 1043 and 1047 . Guillaume´s county developed into the county of Apulia [Puglia], which was elevated to the status of a duchy by the Pope in 1059. The Normans, from their base in Apulia, extended their rule and carved out a new country for themselves in the southern Italian mainland. Their conquest of the island of Sicily was completed by 1091, and in 1127 the duchy of Apulia and the county of Sicily were combined under the rule of Count Roger II who, in 1130, was able to pressure the pope into investing him as king.\n\nThe emergence of the kingdom of Sicily as a new power in the 12th century changed the diplomatic balance of the European medieval world. It was seen by the declining empire of Byzantium as a significant threat to its security, and by the Pope as a useful counter-balance to the troublesome kings of Germany. It should be noted that the kingdom is referred to invariably in primary sources, throughout most of its history, as \"the kingdom of Sicil y\" despite most of its territory being in the mainland of southern Italy and its capital being the city of Naples.\n\nThe Norman dynasty of the kingdom of Sicily became extinct in the legitimate male line at the end of the 12th century. The Hohenstaufen dynasty from Germany succeeded as kings between 1194 and 1266, when Charles Duke of Anjou [Capet] defeated and killed Manfredo King of Sicily and succeeded as Sicilian king with Papal support. Pedro III King of Aragon, who had married the eldest daughter of King Manfredo, also claimed the kingdom of Sicily on the death of his father-in-law. There was little that King Pedro could do in the short term to assert his claim, the general rebellion in Sicily against French rule in 1282 prompted the Aragonese king Pedro to take advantage of the situation. He was offered the Sicilian crown by the inhabitants of Sicily in August 1282 and at the end of that month landed at Trapani to take his kingdom. He quickly conquered the island of Sicily. An Aragonese fleet defeated the Angevin forces in the bay of Naples 5 Jun 1284 and captured Charles d'Anjou Principe di Salerno, heir to the Anjou-Capet kingdom. The dispute escalated, and the two rival kingdoms of Sicily continued in existence side by side until the death of the Angevin Queen Jeanne II without direct heirs in 1435. Queen Jeanne left her kingdom to her distant relation René Duc d'Anjou, although during her lifetime she had promised to make Alfonso V King of Aragon and Sicily her successor. King Alfonso finally imposed himself as ruler in Naples in 1442 and declared Sicily and Naples united to form the \"Kingdom of the Two Sicilies\". On his death in 1458, Sicily reverted to the crown of Aragon, while his illegitimate son Ferrante succeeded as king of Naples.\n\nChapter 1. DUKE of APULIA 1017-1019\n\n[Two] siblings, parents not known:\n\n1. MELUS [Melo] (-Bamberg 23 Apr 1020, bur Bamberg) . The Annales Barenses record that \"Longobardia cum Mele\" rebelled in 1010, captured \"Curcua\" (Kourkouas, Byzantine katepan) 9 May, made war \"in Betete\" {Bitetto, near Bari} where many Barenses were killed, adding that \"Ismael\" made war against the Greeks \"in Monte Peluso\" where Pasiano fell . Lupus Protospatarius records that \"rebellio\" started in May 1009, without mentioning the leaders, adds that the Muslims captured Cosenza in the same year, that \"Curcus\" died in 1010 and \"Basilius catepanus Marsedonici\" arrived in Mar 1010 . The Chronicon Barensi records that \"Ismaël\" made war \"in Monte Pelusio\" with the Greeks in 1011 and captured \"Pasiano\" . Cedrenus records that \"Basilium Argyrum Sami et Contoleonem Cephalleniæ præfectos\" were defeated by \"Meles\" whom Emperor Basileios had sent them to attack in southern Italy . The Chronica Monasterii Casinensis records that \"Melus Barensium civium immo totius Apuliæ primus cum Dato ipsiusque Meli cognato\" rebelled against the Greeks . The Annales Barenses record that \"catepano Basilio cognomento Sardonti\" besieged Bari in Apr 1013 for 61 days before the town surrendered . The Chronica Monasterii Casinensis records that the Norman brothers \"Giselbertus [cum] quatuor fratribus suis, Rainulfo, Asclittino, Osmundo, atque Rodulfo\" arrived in Capua where they joined \"Melus\", dated to [1015/16] from the context . Amatus records that the brothers \"Gilbert Rainulf, Asclettin, Osmund and Rodulf\" went to Capua where they found a man of Apulia named Melus, who had fled there because he had rebelled against the emperor of Constantinople with whom they crossed into Apulia and helped fight the Greeks, placing Melus on the throne of his honor because of the strength of the Normans . It is unclear whether this passage means that Melus was recognised from that time as duke of Apulia, a title later granted to him by Emperor Heinrich II. Lupus Protospatarius records that \"Turnichi catepani\" fought \"cum Mele et Normannis Leo Patiano exubitus\" in 1017, and 22 Jun of the same year defeated \"Melem et Normannos\" when \"Patiano\" died . Amatus records that Melus \"went to the court of the [German] emperor to beg for aid\" but died soon after and was buried in the church of Bamberg . It is assumed that it was some time during his visit to Germany that Emperor Heinrich II created him Duke of Apulia, a title which is attributed to Melus in later German sources (see below) but which he could never have used in Southern Italy as he died while still in Germany. Lupus Protospatarius records that \"Mel cum aliquantis Francis\" fled \"ad Enerichum imperatorem\" in 1019, and that \"Melis dux Apuliæ\" died in 1020 . The Notæ Sepulcrales Babenbergenses record that \"Ysmahel, quem sanctus Heinricus constituit ducem Apullie\" was buried in Bamberg . \"Heinricus Romanorum imperator augustus\" commanded on the request of \"Argiro\" that no other burials take place in the grave of \"patris sui Ismahel ducis Apulie qui et Melo vocabatur\" at Bamberg, by charter dated 29 May 1054 . m ---. The Chronica Monasterii Casinensis records that, after the recapture of Bari (dated to mid-1013 in the Annales Barenses, see above ), the Byzantines captured \"uxorem ipsius Maraldam [=Melus] et filium Argyro\" and sent them to the emperor in Constantinople . The name of Melus's wife is not known. However, the name attributed to Melus's son suggests that she may have been --- Argyre, daughter of ---. Melus & his wife had [three] children:\n\na) [--- Argyros (-Constantinople 1034). Lupus Protospatarius records the death at Constantinople in 1034 of \"Argiro Barensis\" . No other record has been found of this person. It is not known whether he was an older son of Melus. If that was the case, he presumably made peace with the Byzantines as the source makes no reference to his dying in captivity.]\n\na) ARGIRO (-after 1057). The Chronica Monasterii Casinensis records that, after the recapture of Bari (dated to mid-1013 in the Annales Barenses, see above ), the Byzantines captured \"uxorem ipsius Maraldam [=Melus] et filium Argyro\" and sent them to the emperor in Constantinople . It is assumed that \"Argiro\" was originally a family name, maybe inherited from his mother as suggested above. The Annales Barensis record that Byzantine forces with \"Argiro filio Meli\" arrived in Bari in 1040 . Prince of Bari. The Annales Barensis record that \"Normanni et cives Barisani\" chose \"Argiro, qui et Meli\" as their \"principem et seniorem\" in Feb 1042 . Lupus Protospatarius records that \"Argiro\" was made \"Barensis princeps et dux Italiæ\" in Feb 1042 . Amatus records that \"when the Normans had lost their faithless leader [Atenulf, brother of Pandulf VI Prince of Benevento], they turned to Argyrus son of Melus and they elected him their prince\", dated to [1041] from the context, but also records that \"Argyrus spoiled the victory [at Trani] by his folly, for he opposed the victorious wrath of the Normans\" . Argyros´s leadership over the Normans must have been short-lived as the next passage in Amatus records their choice of Guillaume, son of Tancred d´Hauteville, as their leader, dated to early 1042. Patrikios, katepan: the Annales Barensis record that \"Argiro\" defected to the Byzantines and was granted \"patriciatus an cathepanatus vel vestati honoribus\" in 1042 . The Chronicon Breve Normannicum records that \"Argyrus Bariensis imperialis catapanus et dux Græcorum\" defeated the Normans at Taranto in 1045 . Lupus Protospatarius records that \"Argiro patricius\" left for Constantinople in 1046 . Lupus Protospatarius records that \"Argiro magister vesti et dux Italiæ, filius Melis\" left Bari in Mar 1051, and defeated \"Romoaldus et Petri fratres\" who were sent in chains to Constantinople . The Chronicon Breve Normannicum records that \"Argyro catapano Græcorum\" was defeated by the Normans and forced to flee near Taranto in 1052 . \"Heinricus Romanorum imperator augustus\" commanded on the request of \"Argiro\" that no other burials take place in the grave of \"patris sui Ismahel ducis Apulie qui et Melo vocabatur\" at Bamberg, by charter dated 29 May 1054 . The Chronicon Farfense records that \"Argiro magister vestis et dux Italie, Calabrie, Sicilie, Paflagonie, qui et Melis\" granted letters to Farfa dated 1057 . The Anonymi Barensis Chronicon records that Argyros died as proedros .\n\nb) [IOANNACUS . No reference to Ioannacus has been found apart from the entry for his son (see below), whose name suggests a connection with the family of Melus. If this is correct, it is possible that he was the same person as Melus´s son \"Argyros\" named above.] m ---. The name of Ioannacus´s wife is not known. Ioannacus & his wife had one child:\n\ni) --- Argyros (-after 1079). Lupus Protospatarius records that \"Argirichi, filii Ioannaci\" killed \"Bisantius cognomento Guirdeliku in Baro\" . [m ---.] [Two] children:\n\n(a) daughter . The Gesta Roberti Wiscardi records that \"Argiricius\" married his daughter to \"Abagelardus, filius Unfredi\" . m (after 3 Feb 1079) ABELARD, son of ONFROI Conte di Apulia & his wife --- di Salerno (-Constantinople after 1082).\n\n(b) [JACINTA [Jakvinta] (-Constantinople after 1115) . Du Cange states that \"Jacinthæ Archyrizzi nobilis filiam\" was the wife of Konstantin Bodin but the primary source which he cites has not yet been traced . She was the daughter of the leader of the pro-Norman party in Bari, Apulia . She ordered the capture of her husband's first cousin Branislav in [1093/95], anxious to safeguard the rights of her children over Branislav's family in case her husband died. It is likely that these events took place during King Konstantin's imprisonment by the Byzantines . She poisoned Vladimir King of Duklja in [1114], installing her son Djordje as king in his place. When the latter was deposed in [1118], Jakvinta was arrested and sent to Constantinople where she died . m (Apr 1081 ) KONSTANTIN BODIN King of Duklja, son of MIHAILO King of Duklja & his wife --- (-[1101/08]).]\n\n2. [daughter . It is not certain that Datus was married to a sister of Melus. It would also be consistent with Amatus´s text (see below) if he had been the brother of Melus´s wife.] m DATO, son of ---. The Chronica Monasterii Casinensis records that \"Melus Barensium civium immo totius Apuliæ primus cum Dato ipsiusque Meli cognato\" rebelled against the Greeks . The Chronica Monasterii Casinensis records that, after the recapture of Bari (dated to mid-1013 in the Annales Barenses, see above ), \"Dattus\" fled to the abbey of Montecassino, and from thence to Pope Benedict VIII who granted him \"turre de Gariliano\" . Amatus records that Melus \"had a brother-in-law called Dattus\" who on the order of the Pope was given the tower of Garigliano near the river [in Capua] but was attacked by Pandulf [of Capua] who handed him to the Greeks who drowned him at sea . Dato & his wife had three children:\n\na) STEFANO (-after 1022). Amatus records that Emperor Heinrich II gave \"the territory called Comino and its castello\" to Melus´s nephews together with the support of Turstain and twenty four Normans . Conte di Comino. Chalandon identifies these Normans as \"Gilbert, Osmond, Asclettin, Toustain le Bègue, Gautier de Canisy et Hugues Falluca\" . The Chronica Monasterii Casinensis records that \"Stephano autem, Melo et Petro nepotibus præfati Melo\" were granted \"comitatum Cominensis\" (by Emperor Heinrich II) together with \"in auxilium Normannos, Giselbertum, Gosmannum, Stigandum, Torstainum balbum, Gualterium de Canosa et Ugonem Falluccam, cum aliis decem et octo\", dated to [1022] from the context . Chalandon identifies these Normans as \"Gilbert, Osmond, Asclettin, Toustain le Bègue, Gautier de Canisy et Hugues Falluca\" .\n\nb) MELO (-after 1022). Amatus records that Emperor Heinrich II gave \"the territory called Comino and its castello\" to Melus´s nephews together with the support of Turstain and twenty four Normans . Conte di Comino. The Chronica Monasterii Casinensis records that \"Stephano autem, Melo et Petro nepotibus præfati Melo\" were granted \"comitatum Cominensis\" (by Emperor Heinrich II) together with \"in auxilium Normannos, Giselbertum, Gosmannum, Stigandum, Torstainum balbum, Gualterium de Canosa et Ugonem Falluccam, cum aliis decem et octo\", dated to [1022] from the context . Chalandon identifies these Normans as \"Gilbert, Osmond, Asclettin, Toustain le Bègue, Gautier de Canisy et Hugues Falluca\" .\n\nc) PIETRO (-after 1022). Amatus records that Emperor Heinrich II gave \"the territory called Comino and its castello\" to Melus´s nephews together with the support of Turstain and twenty four Normans . Conte di Comino. The Chronica Monasterii Casinensis records that \"Stephano autem, Melo et Petro nepotibus præfati Melo\" were granted \"comitatum Cominensis\" (by Emperor Heinrich II) together with \"in auxilium Normannos, Giselbertum, Gosmannum, Stigandum, Torstainum balbum, Gualterium de Canosa et Ugonem Falluccam, cum aliis decem et octo\", dated to [1022] from the context . Chalandon identifies these Normans as \"Gilbert, Osmond, Asclettin, Toustain le Bègue, Gautier de Canisy et Hugues Falluca\" .\n\n1. ISMAEL . The Annales Barenses record that \"Longobardia cum Mele\" rebelled in 1010, captured \"Curcua\" 9 May, made war \"in Betete\" where many Barenses were killed, adding that \"Ismael\" made war against the Greeks \"in Monte Peluso\" where Pasiano fell . This passage suggests that \"Ismael\" was not the same person as Melus. It seems surprising that Ismael, a Muslim name, could be confused with the Lombard Melus. Two passages in German sources appear to conflate the two individuals: the Notæ Sepulcrales Babenbergenses record that \"Ysmahel, quem sanctus Heinricus constituit ducem Apullie\" was buried in Bamburg , and \"Heinricus Romanorum imperator augustus\" commanded on the request of \"Argiro\" that no other burials take place in the grave of \"patris sui Ismahel ducis Apulie qui et Melo vocabatur\" at Bamberg, by charter dated 29 May 1054 .\n\nChapter 2. COUNTS & DUKES of APULIA, COUNTS & KINGS of SICILY (NORMANS)\n\nA. COUNTS of APULIA 1042-1059, DUKES of APULIA 1059-1127\n\nTANCRED de Hauteville ([980/90]-[1041]). Contemporary sources are contradictory concerning Tancred's origin, varying from \"of quite distinguished family\" in Malaterra to \"of obscure origin\" in the Alexeiad . He is described as \"one of the household of the count of the Normans Richard II\" by Geoffrey Malaterra, who recounts a colourful story of Tancred having killed a boar which had been flushed out by the count during a hunting expedition . Hereditary seigneur de Hauteville-le-Guichard, near Coutances, Normandy . Orderic Vitalis records that Tancredus de Alta-Villa originated de pago Constantino .\n\nm firstly MORIELLA, daughter of ---. Malaterra names \"Moriellam\" as the first wife of Tancred . A myth, not based on any evidence, emerged in the 16th century to the effect that both wives of Tancred de Hauteville were daughters of Richard I Duke of Normandy .\n\nm secondly FRESSENDA, daughter of --- (-bur Church of St Eufemia, near Lampetia ). Malaterra names \"Fresendis\" as the second wife of Tancred . A myth, not based on any evidence, emerged in the 16th century to the effect that both wives of Tancred de Hauteville were daughters of Richard I Duke of Normandy . Orderic Vitalis records that Fredesendis uxor Tancredi de Alta-Villa was buried at ecclesiam Sanctæ Eufemiæ...super littus Adriatici maris .\n\nThe names and order of birth of the children of Tancred de Hauteville are uncertain, although there appears to be unanimity among the various sources about their number. The Annals of Romoald name Tancred's twelve sons (in order) \"Sarnus qui miles insignis extitit comes Coffridus Drogo comes Guillelmus ipse comes Brachiferreus prenomine dictus comes Unfridus Malgerius comes probus atque famosus Robertus Guiscardus Alberedis armis strenuous Tancredus Wilhelmus de Sancto Nicandro Frumentinus Rogerius Sicilie comes\" and in addition state that he had three daughters (unnamed) . Malaterra names (in order) \"Gulielmum cognomine Ferrea-branchis, Drogonem, Humfredum, Gaufredum et Serlonem\" as five sons of Tancred by his first wife and \"Robertus Guiscardus Malgerius, Willelmus, Alveredus, Hubertus, Tancredus, Rogerius\" as his seven sons by his second wife . The name differences between these two sources are not difficult to reconcile: presumably \"Sarnus\" and \"Serlo\" are the same, and even \"Frumentinus\" and \"Hubertus\" bear some similarity. It is possible that the variations are due solely to errors in transcribing unclear script. The differences in the order of birth of the sons are less easy to reconcile. The sources only agree that Roger was the youngest son. The order in which Tancred's sons by his second wife are shown here follows Malaterra. However, the order of birth of his sons by his first wife follows Romoald, with one minor adjustment, for the reasons explained below.\n\nTancred & his first wife had six children:\n\n1. SERLON de Hauteville ([1005/10]-after [1027/35]). Malaterra names \"Serlonem\" fifth in order of Tancred's five sons by his first wife . He is shown first in the list in the Annals of Romoald . As Serlon remained in Normandy after his brothers went to Italy, it is more likely that he was the eldest son who remained at home to inherit his father's lands. At first sight this appears to be contradicted by Orderic Vitalis who records that Tancred d'Hauteville \"passed on his whole inheritance to his son Goisfredus [Geoffrey]\", advising the others \"to seek their living by their strength and wits outside their native land\" . However, Malaterra records that Serlon fled to Brittany after committing murder, some time during the reign of Robert I Duke of Normandy, and from there launched raids against Normandy . The departure of the other brothers for southern Italy is dated to [1035] in other sources (see below). It is possible therefore that Serlon's difficulties occurred at the same time and that this caused a last minute change of plans which involved the promotion of the second son Godefroi. Serlon's birth date range is estimated assuming that he was an adult when obliged to flee Normandy in [1027/35] and provides some support for the hypothesis that he was the oldest son. m ([1027/35]) ---. This marriage took place after Serlon was pardoned by Duke Robert and returned to Normandy, according to Malaterra , so some time during Duke Robert's reign assuming the source is accurate. Serlon & his wife had one child:\n\na) SERLON (-killed in battle near Nicosia, Sicily summer 1072) . Malaterra names \"Serlonem nepotem suum [Rogerii] Serlonis fratris suis filium\" when recounting that he came to Italy, helped his uncle Roger in the capture of Messina (in 1061), and in a later passage that he distinguished himself at Cerami (in 1063) . It was intended that he should share in the government of Sicily , but he was killed in battle before this could be implemented. Malaterra records that \"nepotis sui Serlonis \" was killed \"apud Siciliam a Saracenis\" . m as her first husband, --- di Molise, daughter of RODULF de Moulins Conte di Boiano & his first wife Altruda di Guardia. Malaterra names \"miles Ingelmarus\" and records his marriage to \"uxorem nepotis sui Serlonis filia Rodulfi Bojanensis comitis\" . She married secondly Ingilmar.\n\n2. BEATRIX de Hauteville ([1005/10]-1101) . The Annals of Romoald state that Tancred had three daughters without naming them or stating by which marriage they were born . The chronology of her descendants strongly suggests that Beatrix must have been born in [1005/10] and therefore was one of her parents' older children. The primary source which confirms her name and two marriages has not yet been identified. Beatrix is shown as the daughter of Tancred by his first wife in Europäische Stammtafeln . The basis for this is not known. However, it appears more likely that she was the daughter of his second marriage if her estimated birth date range is correct, especially in light of the approximate date of birth of her brother Robert \"Guiscard\" in [1020]. The Gesta Roberti Wiscardi names \"Robertus de Scabioso Monte comes Gosfredi frater, et ambo orti germana fuerant ducis\" . Guerrieri highlights that \"Gosfredi\" in this passage has been identified as Godefroi Conte di Conversano but that it is not possible to confirm whether this is correct . If the speculation is right, Beatrix was the same person as the daughter of Tancred who is shown below as married to \"--- [di Conversano]\". m firstly ARMAND de Mortain, son of ROBERT Comte d'Eu [Normandie] & his first wife Béatrice ---. m secondly ROGER, son of ---.\n\n3. GODEFROI de Hauteville (-1063) . Malaterra names \"Gaufredum\" as fourth son of Tancred & his first (unnamed) wife . He is shown second in the list in the Annals of Romoald . According to Orderic Vitalis, Tancred d'Hauteville \"passed on his whole inheritance to his son Goisfredus [Geoffrey/Godefroi]\", advising the others \"to seek their living by their strength and wits outside their native land . This suggests that Godefroi was the oldest son. As explained above, the career path of Serlon suggests that there may have been a last minute change of plan which resulted in Godefroi being chosen to inherit their father's lands. For this reason, Godefroi is shown here as second son. Amatus records that the brothers \"Mauger, Geoffrey, William and Roger\" arrived in Apulia from Normandy , dated from the context to [1054/57]. Malaterra records that the Capitanata had been held by \"Gaufridum fratrem suum\" before it was granted to Mauger . Conte di Loritello.\n\n- CONTI di LORITELLO.\n\n4.

Casinensis names (in order) \"Guilelmum, Drogonem et Humfridum Tancridi filios\" when recording their recent arrival from Normandy with 300 other Normans . According to the Annals of Romoald, \"Guillelmus comes Brachiferreus\" was fourth son, after Drogo . The order in Malaterra is the same as in the Chronica Mon. Casinensis . Guillaume is shown here as older than his brothers Drogo and Onfroi because it is considered more probable that the order of succession between them as Counts of Apulia reflected their relative seniority in the family, although it is of course not impossible that Guillaume was more junior among the brothers who left for Italy and that his initial appointment as count was due to personal ability rather than seniority. Orderic Vitalis records ...filii...Tancredi de Alta-Villa: Drogo...atque Umfridus, Willermus et Hermannus, Rotbertus cognomento Wiscardus et Rogerius et sex fratres eorum among those who left Normandy and settled in Apulia . He went to southern Italy with his brother Drogo in [1035], serving in the army of Rainulf the Norman, who was at that time fighting in support of Guaimar IV Prince of Salerno . Amatus records that Prince Guaimar made \"William son of Tancred\" as his captain . They joined the Byzantine forces led by general Giorgios Maniakes, which had sailed from Constantinople in summer 1038 to reconquer Sicily from the Muslims . During the siege of Syracuse in 1040, Guillaume killed the military governor of the town, earning his nickname \"Bras-de-fer\". After returning to Apulia from the Sicilian campaign, he was among the forces which captured Melfi in Mar 1041, aiming to make it the Norman centre from which to lead campaigns to expel the Byzantines from Italy. Within days they captured Venosa, Lavello and Ascoli. They defeated the Greeks on the banks of the river Olivento near Venosa 17 Mar 1041, at Montemaggiore in May where Guillaume was general, and at Monte Siricoloso near Montepeloso 3 Sep 1041. Amatus records that \"the Normans decided among themselves to place a count over them and chose William, son of Tancred\" and after installing him as their count went to the court of Prince Guaimar of Salerno [and] from that hour Guaimar called him prince and Guaimar called himself rector (although this passage would be more consistent with other sources if it read Guillaume called him prince and Guillaume called himself rector) . This represents the moment when he is taken to have become GUILLAUME Conte di Apulia, although it is not apparent from the primary sources that he used the title at the time. Lupus Protospatarius records that \"Guillelmus\" was elected \"comes a Matera\" in Sep 1042 . Ascoli was his fiefdom: Amatus records that \"the Normans divided among themselves\" the lands at Melfi, following their victories against the Byzantines dated to 1041, and that William received Ascoli; Drogo had Venosa; Arnolin had Lavello; Hugh Toutebove had Monopoli; Rodulf had Canne; Walter, Civitate; Peter, Trani; Rodulf son of Bebena, Sant´Arcangelo; Tristan, Montepeloso; Hervey, Grumento; Asclettin, Acerenza; and Rainfroi, Malarbine, adding that Prince Guaimar of Salerno invested each one of them . The Chronica Monasterii Casinensis records the division of properties agreed at Melfi, dated to Feb 1042, as follows: \"Guilelmo Asculum, Drogoni Venusiam, Arnolino Labellum, Ugoni Tutabovi Monopolim, Petro Tranum, Gualterio Civitatem, Rodulfo Cannim, Tristaino Montem pilosum, Herveo Grigentum, Asclittino Acerentiam, Rodulfo Sanctum Archangelum, Raimfrido Monerbinum\" . That Guillaume was the vassal of Guaimar IV Principe di Salerno is confirmed by the prince and his son assuming the title \"Duke of Apulia and Calabria\" in charters dated between Jan 1043 and 1047 . Lupus Protospatarius records \"Gulielmus filius Tancredi\" entering Calabria with \"Guarimari principe\" in 1044 and capturing \"Stridulam castellum\" . Lupus Protospatarius records the death in 1046 of \"Gulielmus\" specifying that his brother \"Drago\" succeeded as count . m ([Sep 1042]) [GUIDA] di Salerno, daughter of GUIDO di Salerno Conte di Conza [Duca di Sorrento] & his wife --- ([1030/32]-). Amatus records the marriage of \"Guida the daughter of his [Guaimar IV Prince of Salerno] brother\" to Guillaume d'Hauteville when the latter was installed as Count of Apulia . Considering that the birth of her father´s older brother is estimated to [1011/12], it is unlikely that Guida could have been born earlier than [1030/32]. She was therefore still a child when she married.\n\n5. DROGO de Hauteville ([1010/20]-murdered Castle of Monte Ilaro 10 Aug 1051, bur Venosa, Monastery of Santissima Trinità) . The Chronica Mon. Casinensis names (in order) \"Guilelmum, Drogonem et Humfridum Tancridi filios\" when recording their recent arrival from Normandy with 300 other Normans . According to the Annals of Romoald, Drogo was the third son, before \"Guillelmus comes Brachiferreus\" . The order in Malaterra order of succession of Guillaume, Drogo and Onfroi as Counts of Apulia reflected their relative seniority in the family, although it is of course not impossible that Guillaume was more junior among the brothers who left for Italy and that his initial appointment as count was due to personal ability rather than seniority. [Orderic Vitalis records that Drogo quidam Normannus miles left on pilgrimage to Jerusalem and, on his return, stopped \"cum sociis suis Waimalchus dux [Guaimar IV Duke of Salerno] apud Psalernum\", from where he expelled \"Sarracenorum\" who had been demanding tribute . It is possible that this passage refers to another Drogo as filiique Tancredi de Alta-Villa: Drogo... are named in a later part of the text, without a reference back to the earlier Drogo.] Amatus records that \"William son of Tancred [came] from Normandy [to Italy] with his two brothers Drogo and Humphrey\" , probably dated to [1035]. Orderic Vitalis records ...filii...Tancredi de Alta-Villa: Drogo...atque Umfridus, Willermus et Hermannus, Rotbertus cognomento Wiscardus et Rogerius et sex fratres eorum among those who left Normandy and settled in Apulia . Venosa was Drogo´s fiefdom from early 1042: Amatus records that \"the Normans divided among themselves\" the lands at Melfi, following their victories against the Byzantines dated to 1041, and that William received Ascoli; Drogo had Venosa; Arnolin had Lavello; Hugh Toutebove had Monopoli; Rodulf had Canne; Walter, Civitate; Peter, Trani; Rodulf son of Bebena, Sant´Arcangelo; Tristan, Montepeloso; Hervey, Grumento; Asclettin, Acerenza; and Rainfroi, Malarbine, adding that Prince Guaimar of Salerno invested each one of them . the Chronica Monasterii Casinensis records the division of properties agreed at Melfi, dated to Feb 1042, as follows: \"Guilelmo Asculum, Drogoni Venusiam, Arnolino Labellum, Ugoni Tutabovi Monopolim, Petro Tranum, Gualterio Civitatem, Rodulfo Cannim, Tristaino Montem pilosum, Herveo Grigentum, Asclittino Acerentiam, Rodulfo Sanctum Archangelum, Raimfrido Monerbinum\" . The Romoaldi Annales record that \"Drogo Normannorum comes\" captured and burnt \"civitatem Bibinum\" {Bovino} in 1045 . Lupus Protospatarius names \"Drago\" as brother of \"Gulielmus\", specifying that he succeeded the latter as count in 1046 . The Gesta Roberti Wiscardi records that \"Unfredum cum fratre Drogone\" disputed the succession of their brother Guillaume with \"Petrus consanguinitate propinquus\" . He succeeded his brother in 1046 as DROGO Conte di Apulia. Guillaume of Jumièges records that Constantiniensis Drogo filius Tancredi de Alta-villa was made princeps Normannorum in Apulia . Amatus records that \"Drogo and Rainaulf\" were \"put into possession of their counties\" by Emperor Heinrich III, dated to 1047 . A charter dated 1047 is the last time in which Guaimar IV Prince of Salerno is named with the title \"Duke of Apulia and Calabria\" . The timing suggests that this may have followed Emperor Heinrich III´s confirmation of Drogo, who thereby presumably ceased to be Guaimar´s vassal. He received Benevento from Emperor Heinrich III in 1047, jointly with Rainulf II Conte di Aversa, after the latter confiscated it from the citizens who had refused to open its gates to him, although the Beneventans invited Pope Leo IX to take over the town. \"Drogo dux et magister Italie comesque Normannorum totius Apulie atque Calabrie\" donated property for the souls of \"fratris mei Guillelmi, Unfredi, Roberti\" by charter dated 1053 . Chalandon discusses the possible spurious nature of this document but opts for its authenticity . The Annals of Romoald record the death of \"Drogo Normannorum comes\" in Aug 1050 . Lupus Protospatarius records that \"Drago\" was killed in 1051 \"in monte Ilari a suo compatre Concilio\" . Guillaume of Jumièges records that Constantiniensis Drogo filius Tancredi de Alta-villa was killed dum vigilias in ecclesia beati Laurentii IV Id Aug by Wazo Neapolitanus comes . Orderic Vitalis records that Drogo was murdered by Waszo Count of Naples at the altar of the church of St Lawrence . m firstly ALTRUDA, daughter of --- (before 1045). \"Riccardus Senescalcus maximi comitis Drogonis filius\" donated property to Cava, for the souls of \"predicti patris mei et Roberti Guiscardi magnifici ducis et Rogerii ducis et Boamundi filiorum eius et Altrude coniugis mee atque Rocce sororis mee et Altrude matris mee\", by charter dated Mar 1115 . It is likely that she was Altruda, related to the comital family of Salerno of Conte Alfan son of Conte Petrus, as shown by the charter dated Aug 1079 under which \"Alfanus filius quondam Petri comitis et Aloara uxor eius filie Castelmanni comitis\" donated property to Cava, for the soul of \"Riccardus parenti illorum filius fuit bene recordationis domni Drogonis comitis qui fuit germanus domni nostri ducis\" . m secondly (1046) as her first husband, GAITELGRIMA di Salerno, daughter of GUAIMAR IV Prince of Salerno & his [second wife Purpura ---] ([before 1032]-after Jan 1087). Amatus records that \"Guaimar\" [Guaimar IV Prince of Salerno] gave Drogo his daughter in marriage \"with a very grand dowry\" after his succession . \"Domina Gaytelgrima comitissa filia Robberti ducis\" donated property to the monastery of La Trinità at Cava for the souls of \"suprascripti domini Robberti et domini Drogonis et domini Affridi comitum qui fuerunt viri sui\" by charter dated Jan 1087 , although the parentage attributed to her in this document is presumably a copyist's error. It is also curious that the document omits any reference to Gaitelgrima's second husband. This copy of the document appears to be defective as another copy records that \"dominæ Gaytelgrimæ comitissæ filiæ bonæ recordationis domini Guaimarii principis et ducis\" donated property for the souls of \"domini Drogonis et domini Roberti et domini Alfredi comitum qui fuerunt viri sui\" and for the souls of \"Purpure genitricis suæ et Ricardi filii sui qui de ipso Roberto comite marito suo primogenitum habuit\" . Amatus records that \"Guaimar\" [Guaimar IV Prince of Salerno] gave Drogo his daughter in marriage \"with a very grand dowry\" after his succession . The chronology of this family suggests that Gaitelgrima was still a child at the time of this marriage. She married secondly ([end 1051/May 1052]) Roberto di Lucera Conte di Gargano. Amatus records that Prince Guaimar gave \"Count Drogo's [daughter]\" to \"Robert brother of Count Richard\", the editor of the edition consulted speculating that \"daughter\" must be an error for \"widow\" . She married thirdly Conte Affred. Count Drogo & his first wife had three children:\n\na) RICHARD ([1047/51]-[1118/Sep 1125]) . \"Petronus comes in Tarentine civitatis\" donated the church of San Giorgio to the abbot of San Benedetto di Taranto, with the consent of \"mei nepoti et seniori domini Riccardi comiti\", by charter dated May 1072 . \"Alfanus filius quondam Petri comitis et Aloara uxor eius filie Castelmanni comitis\" donated property to Cava, for the soul of \"Riccardus parenti illorum filius fuit bene recordationis domni Drogonis comitis qui fuit germanus domni nostri ducis\" by charter dated Aug 1079 . \"Riccardus Drogonis comitis filius et Altrudis coniux mea\" donated the churches of San Angelo, Santa Catarina and San Vito in Mottola to the abbot of SS Trinitá de Cava by charter dated May 1081 . \"Richardo comes cognomento Senescalcus filius bone memorie Drogonis comitis\" donated the church of San Angelo di Terrisino, and property \"Salernitanam civitatem in Lucaniensibus finis in locis Tyrisinum et Staynum et Licosa\" confiscated from \"Ioannes filius Truppoaldi comitis palatii et filii eius Matrone uxori ipsius Ioannis filia cuiusdam Constantini\" by \"Rogerium ducem\", to the abbot of SS Trinitá de Cava by charter dated Jul 1090 . \"Rocca filia Drogoni comiti domina et residente que sum in castello Ullano\" donated property to Monte Cassino, with the consent of \"domino Richardi Senescalco fratri meo et Alexandri filio meo et Drogoni et Uberto toti tres biscerali filii mei, atque mundualdi\", by charter dated Feb 1098, witnessed by \"Guidelmo archipresbiter, Drogoni et Ubberto qui sumus filii predicte domine, Augeri iener qui sum Guidelmo filius Roberto \" . \"Riccardus Siniscalcus Magni quondam Rogerii filius cum domina Albenda uxore mea\" donated the church of Santa Maria de Hospitali Ponti to San Anastasio di Carbone by charter dated May 1100, witnessed by \" Riccardi de Maustrarello, Ruberti Auggæ, Roberti filii Riccardi Senescalchi \" . \"Riccardus comitis Drogonis filius atque Roberti Guiscardi totius Calabrie et Apulie atque Sicilie ducis atque fili eiusdem Rogeri et ipsius heredis dapifer\" donated property inherited from \"soror mea Aumburga\" to the bishop of Nicastro and the church of San Pietro founded by \"sorore mea Aumberga\" by charter dated 1101, witnessed by \"Ugo de Claromonte, Rogerius Roberti ducis filius Dragus frater Alexandri Alexander nepos Riccardi dapifer\" . \"Riccardus Senescalcus filius bone memorie domni Drogoni magnifici comitis\" donated the church of San Pietro apostolo detta de Schlavezolis near Giola to the abbot of san Nicola di Bari, for the souls of \"domne Altrude coniugis nostre et predicti patris nostri et domni Roberti ducis patrui nostri et domni Rogerii ducis domnique Boamundi principis Anthioceni, et domne Rocce nostre sororis, domnique Alexandri militis filii eius, cuius corpus iuxta Sancti Nicolai basilicam in civitate Bari tumulatur\", by charter dated Apr 1108 . \"Ricchardus Senescalcus maximi comitis Drogonis filius cum domina Albereda coniuge mea\" donated the church of Santa Maria di Scanzana to the abbot of Santa Maria di Pisticci by charter dated Mar 1113 . \"Riccardus Senescalcus maximi comitis Drogonis filius\" donated property to Cava, for the souls of \"predicti patris mei et Roberti Guiscardi magnifici ducis et Rogerii ducis et Boamundi filiorum eius et Altrude coniugis mee atque Rocce sororis mee et Altrude matris mee\", by charter dated Mar 1115 . \"Richardus Senescallus, magni comitis Drogonis filius\" donated property to \"cnobio S Salvatoris de Monte Thabor\" by charter dated 15 Jun 1115 . \"Albereda domina Colubrarii et Policorii\" donated property to SS Trinità di Venosa, for the souls of \"Rogerii de Pomareda viri mei\" and for the health of \"viri mei Riccardi Senescalli militis Domini comitis Drogonis filii, et filii mei Roberti\", and with the consent of \"Riccardus Senescallus domini comitis Drogonis filius\", by charter dated 1118 . \"Alexandro de Claromonte et Riccardo fratre meo\" confirmed the donation of the church of Santa Maria di Scanzana to the monastery of San Anastasio di Carbone by \"beatæ memoriæ Riccardi Sinescalci et dominæ Alberedæ amitæ nostræ et Petri Boiti et clarissimi dynastæ domini Boamundi\", by charter dated Sep 1125, witnessed by \"Hugo filius Raneri et Comestabulus, Hugo filius Ascintini de Claromonte \" .

Although the parentage of \"Acreburga\" is not specified in this source, the reference in the following charter to Eremburga having founded the church of San Pietro in Nicastro suggests that the two documents may refer to the same person. It is unclear how \"Acreburga\" would have been authorised to instal a bishop.] \"Riccardus comitis Drogonis filius atque Roberti Guiscardi totius Calabrie et Apulie atque Sicilie ducis atque fili eiusdem Rogeri et ipsius heredis dapifer\" donated property inherited from \"soror mea Aumburga\" to the bishop of Nicastro and the church of San Pietro founded by \"sorore mea Aumberga\" by charter dated 1101, witnessed by \"Ugo de Claromonte, Rogerius Roberti ducis filius Dragus frater Alexandri Alexander nepos Riccardi dapifer\" .\n\n6. ONFROI de Hauteville ([1015/20]-spring 1057, bur Monastery of Santissima Trinità, Venosa) . The Chronica Mon. Casinensis names (in order) \"Guilelmum, Drogonem et Humfridum Tancridi filios\" when recording their recent arrival from Normandy with 300 other Normans . According to the Annals of Romoald, \"Unfridus\" was the fifth son . The order in Malaterra is the same as in the Chronica Mon. Casinensis . Onfroi is shown as fifth son here because it is considered more probable that the order of succession of Guillaume, Drogo and Onfroi as Counts of Apulia reflected their relative seniority in the family. While it is not impossible that, as explained above, Guillaume's initial appointment as count was due to personal ability rather than seniority, it is difficult to imagine that the order of succession of Drogo and Onfroi would have been decided by any factor other than age. Amatus records that \"William son of Tancred [came] from Normandy [to Italy] with his two brothers Drogo and Humphrey\" , probably dated to [1035]. Orderic Vitalis records ...filii...Tancredi de Alta-Villa: Drogo...atque Umfridus, Willermus et Hermannus, Rotbertus cognomento Wiscardus et Rogerius et sex fratres eorum among those who left Normandy and settled in Apulia . Onfroi is not named as having received territories under the agreement reached at Melfi in Feb 1042 (which names his brothers Guillaume and Drogo, see above). The Gesta Roberti Wiscardi records that \"Unfredum cum fratre Drogone\" disputed the succession of their brother Guillaume with \"Petrus consanguinitate propinquus\" . The Chronicon Breve Normannicum records that \"Humphredus\" captured \"Trojam\" and built \"castrum in Bachareza\" in 1048 . Malaterra records that \"fratrem suum Umfredum Abagelardum comitem\" was given \"castrum Lavel\" by his brother Drogo . \"Unfredus comes \" subscribed the charter dated 1053 (misdated) under which \"Drogo dux et magister Italie comesque Normannorum totius Apulie atque Calabrie\" donated property for the soul of \"fratris mei Guillelmi, Unfredi, Roberti\" . He succeeded his brother 1051 as ONFROI Conte di Apulia. Lupus Protospatarius records that \"Drago\" was killed in 1051 \"in monte Ilari a suo compatre Concilio\" and succeeded by \"frater eius Unfreda\" . Guillaume of Jumièges records that Umfridus frater eius succeeded in principatus ei after Constantiniensis Drogo filius Tancredi de Alta-villa was killed . Pope Leo IX, faced with the increasing threat from the Normans to the stability in southern Italy, launched a holy campaign against them, but was defeated and captured at Civitate in 17 Jun 1053. The Chronicon Breve Normannicum records that \"Leone Papa et Principe Beneventano et Catapano imperiali\" fought the Normans \"in principatu Beneventu\", but that \"Rodulphus Princeps\" escaped and Pope Leo was captured by \"Humphredo et Northmannis\" in Jun 1053 . He was only allowed to return to Rome 12 Mar 1054, and died there the following month. The Normans made the most of their advantage, capturing large parts of southern Italy. By end 1055, Oria, Nardon and Lecce had fallen to them. Lupus Protospatarius records the death in 1056 of \"Umfreda\", specifying that his brother \"Robertus\" succeeded as duke . The Chronicon Breve Normannicum records the death in 1056 of \"Humphredus\" and the succession of \"comes Apuliæ Robertus qui dictus est Guiscardus\" . m (after Aug 1051) as her second husband, GAITELGRIMA di Sorrento, widow of RODOLFE Conte d´Aversa, daughter of --- di Sorrento & his wife --- ([1015/20]-). \"Gaitelgrima comitissa senatrix\" donated property to the monastery of San Blasio, for the soul of \"domni Rodolfi comiti seniori mei\", by charter dated Mar 1048, dated to \"comitante domno Guilielmo et domno Herimano in castro Aversum anno primo\" . Amatus refers to the wife of Humphrey as \"the Duke of Sorrento's sister\" . The fact that these references are to the same person is confirmed by the Gesta Roberti Wiscardi which names \"genitus genetrice Hermannus [Comte di Canne] eadem Unfredi fuerat qua filius Abagelardus\" , Abelard being the son of Onfroi and Herman presumably being the son of Rodolfe (who was reported as having received Canne under the treaty of Melfi in 1042 ). Her birth date range is estimated based on her having had children by both her marriages. Onfroi & his wife had five children:\n\na) GEOFFROI . The Gesta Roberti Wiscardi names (in order) \"Gosfridus, Gocelinus, Abagelardus\" as sons of \"Unfredi\" .\n\nb) GOSCELIN .

The Gesta Roberti Wiscardi names (in order) \"Gosfridus, Gocelinus, Abagelardus\" as sons of \"Unfredi\" . Guillaume of Jumièges records that Umfridus left Abailardum filium suum to the protection of Roberto fratri suo...Wischardum cognominaverat together with ducatu Apuliæ . The Annals of Romoald record that \"Bagelardum filium [=Onfridi]\" was his father's successor in 1057 but was deprived and expelled by his uncle Robert \"Guiscard\" . His father appointed his uncle Robert Guiscard as his guardian 1057 , but the latter seized his lands on the death of Onfroi. Amatus recounts that \"Abelard his brother's son\" was among the conspirators against Robert \"Guiscard\" , undated but the context suggests this was in the early 1060s. The revolt spread and was strengthened by a contingent of Varangians which arrived from Constantinople in 1066, captured Bari, Brindisi and Taranto, but was recalled to Byzantium in 1068 to fight the Seljuks. Abelard capitulated in early 1068. The Cronica Trium Tabernarum et de civitate Catanzarii records that \"Robertus Guiscardus\" granted \"Tabernam\" to \"Baialardo nepoti suo, Unfredi comitis filio\" who rebelled against the duke and granted Taberna to \"Guillelmo Capriolo cum nepte sua Adilitia\" . He was one of the leaders of the rebellion against Robert Guiscard in autumn 1078 , seeking refuge in the Byzantine province of Illyria after the rebellion was crushed. The Chronicon Breve Normannicum records that \"Abiligardus comes\" captured \"Trojam\", expelling \"Boamundum filium Rogerti Ducis\", and \"Asculum\" in 1079, although the latter was recaptured by Duke Robert after which \"Abiligardus cum militibus suis\" fled to Constantinople where he died .

The passage does not specify the circumstances by which Giordano lost Taberna. The Cronica Trium Tabernarum et de civitate Catanzarii records that \"comitissa Loritelli vidua\" governed \"terram [Tabernæ] et suos parvulos filios\" after the death of \"Radulfus comes\", adding a dispute arose between \"Iordanum Capriolum et Guillelmum Carbonendum et comitissam Loritelli\" about Taberna .\n\n(c) GUIDO .

If Orderic Vitalis is correct in saying that \"Geoffroy di Conversano\" was nepos of Robert \"Guiscard\" Duke of Apulia, his mother must have been the Duke's sister . This is confirmed when Malaterra records that \"Gaufridum de Conversano neptem suis [Roberti ducis] filius sororis suæ\" . The Gesta Roberti Wiscardi names \"Robertus de Scabioso Monte comes Gosfredi frater, et ambo orti germana fuerant ducis\" . Guerrieri highlights that \"Gosfredi\" in this passage has been identified as Godefroi Conte di Conversano but that it is not possible to confirm whether this is correct .

Malaterra names \"Robertus dictus a nativitate Guiscardus \" first among the sons of Tancred & his second wife . Orderic Vitalis records ...filii...Tancredi de Alta-Villa: Drogo...atque Umfridus, Willermus et Hermannus, Rotbertus cognomento Wiscardus et Rogerius et sex fratres eorum among those who left Normandy and settled in Apulia . Lupus Protospatarius names Robert as brother of \"Umfreda\", specifying that he succeeded the latter in 1056 as duke . Amatus records that \"a man from Normandy Robert later called Guiscard\" arrived in southern Italy \"in aid of his brother whom he asked to give him some land as a benefice, but his brother did not give him any aid or counsel\", dated to [1047] from the context . The same source states that, at first, he joined \"Pandulf\" [Pandulf IV Prince of Capua], who promised him his daughter in marriage . Malaterra records that Robert was given the command of the garrison of Scribla near Cosenza by his half-brother Drogo Count of Apulia, dated to 1049 . This grant was presumably made after the death of Prince Pandulf IV, which is recorded in Feb 949. Amatus records that Robert´s brother gave him \"[in] the very limits of Calabria a very secure mount whch was well supplied with timber [named] San Marco\" {San Marco Argentano, between Malvito and Bisignano } and \"put him in possession of the whole of Calabria\" . Robert´s bandit activities in the region earned him his nickname. After the Normans' victory against Pope Leo IX at Civitate in 1053, they went on to capture further territory in Italy, with Robert taking Minervino, Otranto and Gallipoli, after which his half-brother ordered him back to Calabria fearful of his growing power. The Chronicon Breve Normannicum records that \"Robertus comes\" entered \"Callipolim\", after \"Humphredus\" defeated \"Græcis circa Oriam\", and captured \"Hydrontum et Castrum Minervæ\" in 1055 . His half-brother Onfroi appointed him guardian of his infant son Abailardo, but he seized the latter's lands on Onfroi's death. The Chronicon Breve Normannicum records the death in 1056 of \"Humphredus\" and the succession of \"comes Apuliæ Robertus qui dictus est Guiscardus\" . He was formally acclaimed as his half-brother's successor as Conte di Apulia at Melfi in Aug 1057. Guillaume of Jumièges records that Umfridus left Abailardum filium suum to the protection of Roberto fratri suo...Wischardum cognominaverat together with ducatu Apuliæ . Triggered by the famine of 1058, the population rebelled against their Norman oppressors, the revolt rapidly spreading throughout Calabria. With help from his brother Roger, the rebellion was suppressed. Sweeping aside earlier differences, the papacy under Nicholas II agreed an alliance with the Normans to suppress anti-Pope Benedict X. The anti-pope was captured, unfrocked and imprisoned in the church of Sant'Agnese in Rome. At the Council of Melfi in Aug 1059 Robert declared himself vassal of the Pope, initiating a long alliance between the two powers, which the Normans put to full advantage in consolidating their position of power in Italy and later in Sicily. Pope Nicholas II declared him ROBERT Duke of Apulia, Calabria and Sicily, although the Normans had not then made any claim on Sicily nor set foot there, and encouraged him to complete the conquest of the remaining parts of Italy held by the Byzantines. The Chronicon Breve Normannicum records that \"Robertus comes Apuliæ\" was made \"Dux Apuliæ, Calabriæ et Siciliæ\" by \"Papa Nicolao in civitate Melphis\" to whom he swore homage for all his lands in 1059 . The Chronicon Breve Normannicum records that \"Robertus\" captured \"civitas Tarenti\" in May 1060 and that he later captured \"Brundusium\" . Robert captured Reggio in 1060, and Brindisi in 1062. The Chronicon Breve Normannicum records that \"Miriarcha cum expercitu Imperiali\" defeated \"Robertum et Malgerum\" in Oct 1060 and recovered lands including \"Hydrunte\" . While his brother Roger turned his attention to Sicily, Robert continued his campaigns in Apulia. The Chronicon Breve Normannicum records that \"Robertus Dux\" captured \"Acherontiam\" and besieged \"Melphim\" in 1061, and in 1062 recaptured Brindisi (where he captured \"Miriarcham\") and Oria, and established \"castrum in Mejana\" . Orderic Vitalis records that Robert de Grantmesnil, ex-abbot of Ouche, in seeking his restoration as abbot sought help from Rodbertum Wiscardum Calabriæ ducem who invited him and his monks to install themselves permanently there and granted ecclesiam Sanctæ Eufemiæ...super littus Adriatici maris to him, dated to [1061/63] . Having suppressed the rebellion of his nephew Abelard in 1068, he took advantage of the withdrawal of Byzantine troops to fight the Seljuks in Asia Minor, and laid siege to Bari. The Chronicon Breve Normannicum records that \"Robertus Dux\" defeated \"Græci\" at \"campo Litii\" and captured \"Gavianum, Obbianum et Barim\" in 1069 and \"Brundusium\" in 1071 . Bari surrendered 16 Apr 1071 after a three year siege, following the arrival of support from Robert's brother Roger from Sicily. They moved on together to Sicily and captured Palermo in 1072. The Chronicon Breve Normannicum records that \"Robertus Dux\" invaded Sicily with a large fleet in 1072 and that \"Goffridus comes\" besieged and captured Palermo . Robert claimed suzerainty over the island, having been invested as Duke by the Pope several years earlier, but installed his brother Roger as Count of Sicily and left Sicily for the last time himself end 1072. The Chronicon Amalphitani records that \"Dux Robertus Guiscardus de gente Normannorum\" expelled Duke Ioannes from Amalfi in Nov 1074 . In 1076, he laid siege to Salerno, the last Lombard state in southern Italy. After its surrender on 13 Dec 1076, Robert installed his capital there. On 19 Dec 1077, he attacked Benevento, which resulted in the Pope excommunicating him a second time 3 Mar 1078. After the death of his ally Richard Prince of Capua, he was obliged to lift the siege. Later in the year, several of his principal vassals rebelled against Robert. The revolt spread rapidly to all his mainland Italian territories, but was suppressed the following year . After years of rivalry with Pope Gregory VII, a meeting was arranged 29 Jun 1080 at which Robert swore fealty for the lands which he held from the Papacy. Robert then turned his attention to Byzantium, in particular the Byzantine province of Illyria where his rebel nephew Abailardo had sought refuge, on the pretext of revenging his daughter who had been put in a convent after her betrothal to Konstantinos Dukas had been broken in 1078. After capturing Durazzo in 1081, most of the Illyrian coast fell under his control. Called upon to defend Pope Gregory VII against Emperor Heinrich IV and his anti-Pope Clement III, Robert was obliged to return to Italy. In 1084, he attacked Rome, but was faced with a popular uprising against the excesses of his troops, and saved by his son Roger \"Borsa\". Returning to Greece, he succeeded in recapturing Corfu which had been lost in his absence, but died of fever on his way to capture Cephalonia.

Amatus records that \"Gerard who was called Buonalbergo\" came to Robert \"Guiscard\" who was visiting his brother in Apulia, proposed his marriage to \"my aunt, my father´s sister Alberada\" (specifying that Robert´s brother Drogo at first opposed the marriage) and agreed to serve him in Calabria, dated to [1050/51] from the context, adding that Gerard was \"believed to have been the first to call him Guiscard\" . Malaterra names \"Alberadam\" as the first wife of Robert \"Guiscard\", recording that they were separated on grounds of consanguinity , although the precise relationship between husband and wife is not known. The Chronica Mon. Casinensis names the first wife of Robert as \"Alveradam amitam suam [=Girardus de bono alipergo]\", recording the couple's separation on grounds of consanguinity .\n\nm secondly ([1058/59]) SICHELGAITA di Salerno, daughter of GUAIMAR IV Prince of Salerno & his wife Gemma of Capua ([1040/45]-Salerno 27 Jul 1090, bur Monte Cassino). The Gestis Ducum Normannorum names \"primogenitam filiam Gaumarii principis Salerni Sichelgaitam\" as the wife of \"Robertus Wiscardus Normannigena dux Apuliæ\" . The Annals of Romoald in 1060 record the marriage of \"Sikelgaitum Guaimerii principis filia\" and \"Robbertus Guiscardus\" . Malaterra names \"filiamque Gaimari Salernitani principis Sigelgaytam\" as the second wife of Robert \"Guiscard\" . The Chronica Mon. Casinensis names the second wife of Robert as \"sororem Salernitani principis Sikelgaita\" . Her birth date is estimated from her having borne children immediately after her marriage. Her husband became heir to the Principality of Salerno through this marriage, although her husband forestalled his inheritance by conquering Salerno in 1077. The Alexeiad names Robert \"Guiscard\"'s wife Gaita when recording that \"she went on campaign with her husband and when she donned armour she was indeed a formidable sight\" . She successfully laid siege to Trani, while her husband did the same at Taranto, as part of their campaign to suppress the rebellion of autumn 1078. She also fought in the battle to capture Durazzo in 1081/82. The Annals of Romoald record the death in Apr 1090 of \"Sikelgaita ducissa mater Rogerii ducis\" .\n\nRobert \"Guiscard\" & his first wife had [two children]:\n\n1. MARCO [Bohémond] of Apulia (1052-Canosa di Puglia, Apulia 6/7 Mar 1111, bur Cathedral of Canosa di Puglia) . The Annals of Romoald name \"Boamundum\" as the son of Robert \"Guiscard\" & his first wife . The Lignages d'Outremer name \"Beymont\" as son of \"Robert Guichart qui conquest Puille\", stating that he was \"prince de Tarente\" before he was granted Antioch . William of Tyre records \"Boamundus\" as son of Robert Guiscard in 1097 . He inherited the large size and height of his father . However, it is clear from subscription lists in charters that Bohemond was excluded from the succession in Apulia, at least from the time his half-brothers were of age. For example, \" Marchisus cognomina Boiemont \" is listed sixth among the subscribers of the charter dated 19 Feb 1076 under which \"Rotbertus dux\" made concessions to the cathedral of Santa Maria at Melfi . \" Marcus qui Abbamonte dicor filius eius \" subscribed the charter dated 19 Jun 1080 under which \"Rubbertus dux\" granted property to Montecassino, after his half-brother Roger . His father gave him command of the campaign against Byzantine Illyria in 1081. He captured Valona, was defeated in a naval battle by the Venetians allied with Byzantium, but then laid siege to Durazzo. During his father's temporary absence attacking Rome, Bohémond lost most of the conquered territory. On the death of his father, he fought his half-brother Roger, whom his father had designated sole heir in Apulia. Moving southwards from his castle at Taranto, he captured Oria and Otranto, and was able to force peace in return for the grant, not only of Oria and Otranto, but also of Gallipoli, Taranto and Brindisi together with the region between Conversano and Brindisi, with the title Prince of Taranto. In 1090, he annexed Bari but was faced with rebellion by the Count of Conversano and the Lord of Montescaglioso. As one of the leaders of the First Crusade, he acceptance to swear allegiance to Emperor Alexios I in Apr 1097, agreeing that the emperor should become overlord of any new principalities founded by the crusaders and that any land captured which had previously belonged to the empire should be handed back to Byzantium . Albert of Aix records that \"Boemundus\" swore allegiance to the emperor and agreed not to conquer any territory within the empire without the emperor´s consent . He played a decisive role in the capture of Antioch 28 Jun 1098 after a siege lasting 8 months. After the fall of Antioch, Bohémond declared himself BOHEMOND I Prince of Antioch in defiance of his oath of allegiance to the emperor. Faced with attacks from both the Turks and Byzantium, both of whose interests were threatened by the establishment of the new principality of Antioch on their borders, Bohémond left his nephew Tancred as regent in Antioch and returned to Europe in 1104 to prepare a larger-scale campaign against Byzantium to overthrow Emperor Alexios I. With English, French and Papal support, he marched on Byzantium but was defeated at Avlona near Durazzo on the Adriatic coast Oct 1107. Emperor Alexios confirmed Bohémond as Prince of Antioch, but obliged him to accept Byzantine suzerainty in the Treaty of Devol in 1108 . Bohémond lived the remaining years of his life in Apulia.\n\n- PRINCES of ANTIOCH.\n\n2. [EMMA ([1045/55]-). She is named Emma in the Gesta Tancredi and by Tudebodus Imitatus, both of whom state that she was the sister of Robert \"Guiscard\" . Orderic Vitalis also says that she was the sister of Robert \"Guiscard\" but does not name her . William of Tyre records \"Tancredus\" as \"ex sorore nepos\" of Robert Guiscard . Albert of Aix names her son \"Tancredus filius sororis Boemundi\" . Guibert, on the other hand, refers to \"Tancredum, Marchionis cujusdam ex Boemundi, nisi fallor, sorore filium, cujus frater cum Hugone Magno præcesserat cui Guillelmus erat vocabulum, et quemdam qui dicebatur de priima civitate Richardum nominatiores agnovimus, virum sane pulchra corporis habitudine spectandum: quem pro Constantia, Boemundi conjuge, ad Franciæ regem vidimus legatione perfunctum\" . Tancred is described as Bohémond's nephew \"so nevolo de una sorella\" in Itinerario di la Gran Militia a la Pavese . Chronologically it is more probable that Emma was the daughter, rather than sister, of Robert \"Guiscard\". If she had been his sister, she could not have been born much later than 1030, which appears inconsistent with the likely birth dates of her two sons in the early 1070s. If she was his daughter, it is unlikely that she could have been born from Robert's second marriage as she would have been too young to have given birth in the late 1060s/early 1070s. It is also possible that Emma was Robert's illegitimate daughter, although this seems improbable if her husband was as illustrious as appears from his title, and also inconsistent with her son marrying the daughter of the king of France. m ODO [Guglielmo] \"le Bon\", son of --- (-after 1085). Marchese. Orderic Vitalis records that Tancred was the son of \"Odonis boni marchisi\" . William of Tyre, on the other hand, records Tancred as \"Tancredus Willelmi marchionis filius\" . \"Tancrede figliolo di Vuillermo Marchion\" is also recorded in Itinerario di la Gran Militia a la Pavese . He is simply called \"Marchisum\" in the Gesta Tancredi, which states that Tancred was \"a patre quidem haud ignobilis filius\" . Tudebodus Imitatus refers to the father of Tancred as \"qui Marchusus dictus est\" . His sons are consistently referred to as \"Marchisi filius\" in contemporary chronicles concerning the First Crusade. These references suggest that he was alive at the time and, because he is referred to without a name, that he was such a well-known figure as to be recognisable only by his title. The illustrious marriage of Tancred son of \"the Marquis\" to the daughter of Philippe I King of France in 1106 is also best explained if the bridegroom had good family connections on his father's as well as his mother's side of the family. The names \"Guglielmo\" and \"Odo\" suggest a family relationship with the northern Italian family of the Marchesi di Monferrato, although it is not known what connections they may have had with southern Italy. Pushing this speculation further, the name of the first wife of Guglielmo [III] Marchese di Ravenna, the father of Ranieri Marchese di Monferrato, is unknown. Assuming that his connection with southern Italy could be proved, it is not impossible that Guglielmo married firstly Emma daughter of Robert \"Guiscard\" and was father by her of Tancred. The highly speculative nature of these conjectures must be emphasised. However, no other contemporary marchese Guglielmo or Odo has so far been identified in records relating to either northern or southern Italy. Orderic Vitalis records that Robert \"Guiscard\" Duke of Apulia summoned \"Odon the Marquis\", among others, to his deathbed in 1085 , which also gives some indication of the relative importance of Odo/Guglielmo in contemporary southern Italy.]\n\n- PRINCES of ANTIOCH.\n\nRobert \"Guiscard\" & his second wife had eleven children:\n\n3. MATHILDE of Apulia ([1059]-after 6 Jun 1112, bur Girona) .

The Alexeiad records that Robert \"Guiscard\" betrothed \"one daughter to Raymond, son of the Count Barcinon\" but does not name her . Her parentage is confirmed by the Vita Sancti Ollegarii which names her son Raymundum comitem Barchinonensem filium filiæ Roberti Guisardi principis Apuliæ . She was known as MAHALTA in Catalonia. She was strongly supported by Guillem Ramón Seneschal of Catalonia and his brothers after the murder of her first husband. Her second marriage is deduced from the testament of her son by her first marriage \"Raimundus Berengarii Barchinonensis comes et marchio\", dated [8 Jul] 1130, which appoints \"Aimericum fratrem meum\" as one of the testator's manumissores . \"Aimericus vicecomes Narbone et uxor mea Mealtis et filiorum eius\" donated property to the abbey of Saint-Martial on leaving for the Holy Land, by charter dated [1100/01] .
