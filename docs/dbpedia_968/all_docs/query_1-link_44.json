In the fourth year of his reign, the Prussian armed forces invaded Westphalia, beginning the brutal First World War. Between 1866 and 1870, there was nothing but stalemate on the front-lines. Eventually, the war ended in victory for Prussia and her allies, leaving France humiliated and defeated. Napoleon is often considered the worst French Emperor."
