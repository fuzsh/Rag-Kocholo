        "text": "by Scott Mehl\n\n© Unofficial Royalty 2017\n\nThe modern Kingdom of Italy was established in 1861 when the kingdoms of Sardinia and The Two Sicilies (itself made up of the former kingdoms of Sicily and Naples) were united into one new kingdom. Ruled by the House of Savoy, the Kingdom of Italy ceased to exist in 1946 when the country abolished the monarchy and became a Republic. When it came to burial sites, there were several traditional locations, as well as a new site decided upon by the second king, Umberto I.\n\n********************\n\nHautecombe Abbey was the traditional burial site of the House of Savoy from the late 1100s until the early 1500s. Located on the shores of Lake Bourget in Saint-Pierre-de-Curtille, France, Hautecombe began as a religious community in about 1101, and in 1125 moved to its current location, on land it was gifted by Amedeo III, Count of Savoy. The area, later part of the Duchy of Savoy, was annexed by France in 1792 and returned to the Kingdom of Sardinia in 1815. It returned to France in 1860, in part of the agreement which led to the establishment of the modern Kingdom of Italy.\n\nHautecombe Abbey once again became a Royal burial site in 1983 when the last King of Italy, Umberto II, was interred there. His wife, Queen Marie José, was also buried there in 2001.\n\nThe Basilica of Superga, built on a hill in Turin, was another traditional burial site for the House of Savoy. The Basilica was built in the early 1700s, with the crypt inaugurated in 1778 by King Vittorio Amedeo III of Sardinia, who had the remains of several members of the House of Savoy moved there.\n\nThe crypt is divided into five rooms, including the Hall of Kings, the Queens Hall, and the Hall of Infants. Traditionally, at the death of the sovereign, his remains were placed in the center of the Hall of Kings. Upon the next death of a sovereign, the previous King’s remains were then moved to one of the niches surrounding the room. The last Sovereign buried there was King Carlo Alberto of Sardinia, whose tomb remains in the center of the Hall. None of the Kings of Italy are buried here, but it is the burial site of the wife and children of King Vittorio Emanuele II, the first King of Italy.\n\nThe first two Kings of Italy chose The Pantheon, in Rome, as their burial site. Originally a Roman temple built in the 2nd century, The Pantheon is one of the best-preserved ancient Roman buildings in Europe and has been in continual use as a church since at least the 7th century. Upon the death of King Vittorio Emanuele II in 1878, it was decided that The Pantheon should be the burial site for the Italian kings. Vittorio Emanuele II, his son, Umberto I, and Umberto’s wife Margherita, are all buried there.\n\n********************\n\nThe Italian Monarchs\n\nVittorio Emanuele II of Italy – reigned March 17, 1861 – January 9, 1878\n\nUmberto I of Italy – reigned January 9, 1878 – July 29, 1900\n\nVittorio Emanuele III of Italy – reigned July 29, 1900 – May 9, 1946\n\nUmberto II of Italy – reigned May 9, 1946 – June 12, 1946\n\nUnofficial Royalty: Italian Index\n\n**********\n\nKing Vittorio Emanuele II of Italy\n\nreigned March 17, 1861 – January 8, 1878\n\nUnofficial Royalty: King Vittorio Emanuele II of Italy\n\nKing Vittorio Emanuele II was the first King of Italy, reigning from 1861 until 1878. He was born on March 14, 1820, at the Palazzo Carignano in Turin, the eldest son of Carlo Alberto, Prince of Carignano, and Archduchess Maria Theresa of Austria. In 1831, his father became King Carlo Alberto I of Sardinia, having succeeded a distant cousin. On April 12, 1842, he married Archduchess Adelheid of Austria, and the couple had eight children: Maria Clotilde (1843); King Umberto I (1844); Amedeo (1845); Oddone (1846); Maria Pia (1847); Carlo Alberto (1851); Vittorio Emanuele (1852); and another Vittorio Emanuele (1855). He became King of Sardinia upon his father’s death in 1849. After his wife’s death in 1855, Vittorio Emanuele married a second time – morganatically – to his longtime mistress, Rosa Vercellana, with whom he already had two children: Vittoria (1848) and Emanuele (1851). On March 17, 1861, Vittorio Emanuele proclaimed himself King of the newly unified Kingdom of Italy.

Remarkably intelligent, he became an avid promoter of the arts and had a great passion for archeology, natural history, and literature, amassing large collections of items of each. At just nineteen years of age, Oddone died on January 22, 1,866 at the Royal Palace of Genoa.
