        "text": "Queen consort of Spain from 1870 to 1873\n\nMaria Vittoria Carlotta Enrichetta Giovanna dal Pozzo, 6th Princess of Cisterna d'Asti and of Belriguardo (9 August 1847 – 8 November 1876), was an Italian noblewoman who was Queen of Spain from 16 November 1870 until 11 February 1873 as the wife of King Amadeo I. Maria Vittoria inherited her princely title after the death of her father.[1] In 1867, she married Amadeo, then Duke of Aosta, second son of King Victor Emmanuel II of Italy. In 1870, her husband became the king of Spain, making her queen consort. King Amadeo abdicated after a reign of less than three years, and he and Maria Vittoria returned to Italy. She died in Sanremo, Italy, in 1876.\n\nEarly life\n\n[edit]\n\nShe was the eldest and only surviving child of Carlo Emanuele dal Pozzo della Cisterna, 5th Prince of Cisterna d'Asti and of Belriguardo, and his wife, Countess Louise de Mérode-Westerloo.[1] Upon the death of her father in 1864, she inherited his noble titles and thus became the Princess of Cisterna d'Asti and of Belriguardo, Marquise of Voghera and Countess of Ponderano, among other titles, in her own right.\n\nMarriage\n\n[edit]\n\nOn 30 May 1867 in Turin, she married Prince Amadeo of Savoy, the Duke of Aosta and second son of King Victor Emmanuel II of Italy.[1] An urban legend circulates that claims numerous tragedies to have befallen the wedding of Maria Vittoria and the Duke of Aosta.[2]\n\nHer husband was elected to occupy the vacant Spanish throne on 16 November 1870. She lived a discreet life in Spain and only involved herself in charity. Amadeo resigned from his position on 11 February 1873, and he and Maria Vittoria returned to Italy. Her health was damaged by the trip and childbirth, and she died later that year of tuberculosis in Sanremo.[3]\n\nIssue\n\n[edit]\n\nPrince Emanuele Filiberto of Savoy-Aosta, Duke of Aosta (13 January 1869 – 4 July 1931), Marshal of Italy, married to Princess Hélène of Orléans and had issue.\n\nPrince Vittorio Emanuele of Savoy-Aosta, Count of Turin (24 November 1870 – 10 October 1946), died unmarried.\n\nPrince Luigi Amedeo of Savoy-Aosta, Duke of the Abruzzi (29 January 1873 – 18 March 1933), Vice Admiral in the Italian Royal Navy, died unmarried.\n\nHonours\n\n[edit]\n\nKingdom of Italy : Dame Grand Cross of the Order of Saints Maurice and Lazarus.[4]\n\nAustria-Hungary : Dame of the Order of the Starry Cross.[4]\n\nAncestry\n\n[edit]\n\nReferences\n\n[edit]"
