Royal Haga Cemetery, Stockholm, Sweden\n\nInteresting accounts of royal burials. Often choice of burial ground is a good indication of affinity and affection. Even descendants of our early Celtic and English princes still choose to have their ashes scatered over the royal burial grounds at Iona. I recall from my school history that when William I fell and died his courtiers were so afraid of him in death his body lay unattended for days, it supturated and decomposed before anyone would deal with it. A fitting end no doubt for the man who ordered the last English king, when captured at Senlac, to be gelded, eviscerated alive then his spine axed through by his close personal Norman thugs. The chivalrous Normans wouldn't allow the English to bury their dead. They lay where they fell for years. Interesting that 30% of land in England still \"owned\" by the descendents of Breton, Flemish, Norman and French mercenaries in William's service.\n\nAs far as I can tell, Jonny, Princess Alice is still buried at the Church of St. Mary Magdalene in Jerusalem.\n\nThe Duke of Edinburgh and Princess George of Hanover visited the church in 1994 for a ceremony honoring their mother.. but I have found nothing to indicate that she has been re-interred elsewhere.\n\nThey didn't even move her there until 1988, almost 20 years after her death. I doubt they would move her yet again, considering it was her wish to be buried in Jerusalem.\n\nwell not quite......alice was a great granddughter of the old queen...\n\nqueen victoria> princess alice grand duchess of hesse>princess victoria of hesse>princess alice of battenburg.\n\nbtw....some years ago i had read that the remains of princess alice was to be removed from her burial place in jerusalem......but i do not know the outcome of this.....i would be very interested to know the outcome please !!\n\nOops, sorry, my mistake in omitting \"great\" before granddaughter. Thank you for the correction, jonnydep. There is a wonderful biography called \"Alice, Princess Andrew of Greece\" by Hugo Vickers and in the epilogue, Vickers details all of the obstacles surmounted before Alice could be moved to Jerusalem. As far as I know, her body still lies there near her aunt.\n\nI thought this would be fun and interesting.. the burials of the Pretenders!\n\nBurials of the Jacobite Succession\n\nHouse of Stuart\n\nJames Francis Edward Stuart (1688-1766)\n\n\"King James III of England, VIII of Scotland\"\n\nBuried - St. Peter's Basilica, The Vatican\n\nMaria Klementyna Sobieska (1702-1735)\n\nwife of James Francis Edward Stuart\n\n\"Queen Maria, Consort of England and Scotland\"\n\nBuried - St. Peter's Basilica, The Vatican\n\nCharles Edward Stuart (1720-1788)\n\nBonnie Prince Charlie\n\n\"King Charles III of England and Scotland\"\n\nBuried - The Cathedral Basilica of St. Peter Apostle, Frascati, Italy (1788)\n\nRe-interred in 1807 - St. Peter's Basilica, The Vatican\n\nHis heart and \"praecordia\" were left at the Cathedral in Frascati\n\nPrincess Louise of Stolberg-Gedern (1752-1824)\n\nwife of Charles Edward Stuart\n\n\"Queen Louise, Consort of England and Scotland\"\n\nBuried - Castellani Chapel, Basilica di Santa Croce, Florence, Italy\n\nHenry Benedict Stuart (1725-1807)\n\n\"King Henry IX of England, I of Scotland\"\n\nBuried - St. Peter's Basilica, The Vatican\n\nUpon Henry's death, the succession passed to the House of Savoy through Henrietta Anne, youngest daughter of Charles I, and devolved upon her great-great grandson.\n\nHouse of Savoy\n\nCharles Emmanuel IV of Sardinia (1751-1819)\n\nKing of Sardinia\n\n\"King Charles IV of England and Scotland\"\n\nBuried - Church of Sant'Andrea al Quirinale, Rome, Italy\n\nMarie Adélaïde Clotilde Xavière de France (1759-1802)\n\nQueen Consort of Sardinia\n\nwife of Charles Emmanuel IV of Sardinia\n\n\"Queen Clotilde, Consort of England and Scotland\"\n\nBuried - Church of Santa Caterina a Chiaia, Naples, Italy\n\nVictor Emmanuel I of Sardinia (1759-1824)\n\nKing of Sardinia\n\n\"King Victor of England and Scotland\"\n\nBuried - The Basilica of Superga, Turin, Italy\n\nArchduchess Maria Teresa of Austria-Este (1773-1832)\n\nQueen Consort of Sardinia\n\nwife of Victor Emmanuel I of Sardinia\n\n\"Queen Maria Teresa, Consort of England and Scotland\"\n\nBuried - The Basilica of Superga, Turin, Italy\n\nMaria Beatrice of Savoy (1792-1840)\n\nArchduchess of Austria-Este, Duchess of Modena, Reggio and Mirandola\n\n\"Queen Mary III of England, II of Scotland\"\n\nBuried - Chiesa di San Vincenzo, Modena, Italy\n\nSuccession devolved upon the House of Austria-Este and the son of Maria Beatrice of Savoy.\n\nHouse of Austria-Este\n\nFrancis V, Duke of Modena (1819-1875)\n\n\"King Francis I of England and Scotland\"\n\nBuried - Capuchin Church, Vienna, Austria\n\nPrincess Adelgunde of Bavaria (1823-1914)\n\nDuchess of Modena\n\nwife of Francis V, Duke of Modena\n\n\"Queen Adelgunde, Consort of England and Scotland\"\n\nBuried - (presumably) Capuchin Church, Vienna, Austria\n\nMaria Theresia of Austria-Este (1849-1918)\n\nQueen Consort of Bavaria\n\n\"Queen Mary IV of England, III of Scotland\"\n\nBuried - Chapel at Castle Wildenwart, Bavaria, Germany\n\nRe-interred in 1921 at the Cathedral of Munich, Bavaria, Germany\n\nSuccession devolved upon the House of Wittelsbach and the son of Maria Theresia of Austria-Este.\n\nHouse of Wittelsbach\n\nRupprecht, Crown Prince of Bavaria (1869-1955)\n\n\"King Robert I of England, IV of Scotland\"\n\nBuried - Crypt of the Theatine Church St. Cajetan, Munich, Bavaria, Germany\n\nMarie Gabrielle, Duchess in Bavaria (1878-1912)\n\nCrown Princess of Bavaria\n\nwife of Rupprecht, Crown Prince of Bavaria\n\n\"Queen Marie Gabrielle, Consort of England and Scotland\"\n\nBuried - Crypt of the Theatine Church St. Cajetan, Munich, Bavaria, Germany\n\nAlbrecht, Duke of Bavaria (1905-1996)\n\n\"King Albert of England and Scotland\"\n\nBuried - Kloster Andechs, Andechs, Bavaria, Germany\n\nCountess Marita von Trakostjan (1904-1969)\n\nDuchess of Bavaria\n\n1st wife of Albrecht, Duke of Bavaria\n\n\"Queen Marita, Consort of England and Scotland\"\n\nBuried - Kloster Andechs, Andechs, Bavaria, Germany\n\nCountess Marie-Jenke von Buzin (1921-1983)\n\nDuchess of Bavaria\n\n2nd wife of Albrecht, Duke of Bavaria\n\n\"Queen Marie-Jenke, Consort of England and Scotland\"\n\nBuried - Kloster Andechs, Andechs, Bavaria, Germany\n\nThe current Jacobite king is Franz, Duke of Bavaria, born in 1933 to Albrecht and his first wife Marita. He is recognized as \"King Francis II\".

It's interesting\n\nhi nat....\n\nwell these early kings of england was more french in outlook then english....william the conqueor was duke of normandy (a french duchy) before he become king of england and held land within france. his granddaughter queen matilda had married the french count of anjou and thier son king henry II had married the greatest french heiress of the day....eleanor of aquitaine....thus henry held land and ruled an empire which strecthed from the scottish border to the pyrenees (the angevin empire). although he was king of england and england provided him with great wealth....the heart of the empire was indeed anjou the land of his forefathers..... thus these kings perhaps regarded themselves as french, rather than english !! hence as to why they wished to be buried in thier beloved france !!\n\ni hope you can understand in what i am trying to say nat !!\n\nAfter a brief search, I found a list which shows Henry II and Richard I buried in France but it also lists William the Conqueror as being buried at Waltham Abbey. That can't be right, can it?\n\nthis sometimes happens where the remains of kings and queens are buried in two separate places.....two examples of which are...\n\nking robert I (the bruce) of scotland.... he was buried in dunfermline abbey scotland, whilst his heart (in accordence to his dying wish) is buried in melrose abbey, scotland !!\n\nqueen marie of rumania (a granddaughter of queen victoria) her heart was also buried elsewhere to that of her body...firstly in her chapel at balcic , but was later removed, (just prior to the bulgarians taking the possession of the territory) and was placed by her daughter princess ileana in the queens castle at bran !!\n\nbut i am not sure if this is the case with king william though !!.....\n\nCaroline Mathilde is not buried in Roskilde Cathedral. She was thrown out of Denmark after the affair with Struensee was discovered and spend her remaining years (she was only 26 at the time of her death) in Celle, near Hannover, Germany and she is buried in the vault of Celle Castle Church.\n\nyes i agree !!\n\ni have just checked in my book..burkes royal families of the world.... and yes it does state that the queen had died at celle 10 may 1775 and was buried there !!\n\nsorry queen catherine.....\n\nI think Caroline Matilda and Christian VII were both tragic figures.\n\nChristian was severely mentally ill when he married the fifteen year old Caroline, possibly suffering from schizophrenia. He was even the one that brought Struensee to court.\n\nOf course, Caroline and Christian were divorced and Struensee was executed. Caroline spent the remainder of her life in Celle and never saw her children again.\n\nFrom that point on, Denmark fell under the regency of the Dowager Queen Juliana and Christian's younger brother Frederick, until Christian's son became regent in 1784. Christian VII died 1808 in Rendsburg, which is where I live.\n\nCaroline's daughter, Louise Auguste of Denmark, is almost certainly Struensee's daughter, and portrait comparisons strongly suggest this.\n\nLouise Auguste became the Duchess of Augustenborg through her marriage, and was the mother of another Queen of Denmark, Caroline Amalie, the second wife of Christian VIII. She died without issue, and it is this Caroline that is buried at Roskilde."
