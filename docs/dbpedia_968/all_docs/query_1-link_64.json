Considered one of the most beautiful and brilliant performers of her age, her voice possessed an exceptionally flexible quality, and contemporaries such as the novelist Fanny Burney, and the antiquarian Horace Walpole commented on the beauty of her vocal range. Her talent was combined with an extraordinarily capricious nature, and the often high-handed treatment she accorded to enamoured royalty and members of the nobility, all added to make her an extremely picturesque public celebrity. Her career was one of great success, and Catterina sang and performed throughout all the major courts and capitals in Europe. Also an able business manager, she was able to retire an extremely wealthy woman. Caterina Gabrielli died (Feb 16, 1796) aged sixty-five.\n\nGabrielli, Charlotte de Bonaparte, Princess â (1795 â 1865)\n\nFrench Napoleonic princess\n\nChristine Charlotte de Bonaparte was born (Feb 22, 1795) at St Maximin, the elder daughter of Lucien Bonaparte (1775 â 1840) the first Prince de Canino-Musignano and his first wife Christine Boyer (1773 â 1800), the daughter of Pierre Boyer. She was the granddaughter of Carlo Bonaparte and his wife Letizia di Ramolino, and was the niece of the Emperor Napoleon I. Charlotte was educated by nuns in Italy and her grandmother Madame Mere nicknamed her âLolotte.â Plans for her marriage to the Spanish prince Ferdinando of the Asturias (Ferdinand VII) were discarded by Napoleon due to the princeâs unsavoury reputation.\n\nWith Napoleonâs divorce from the Empress Josephine (1809), her father hoped that the emperor might marry Charlotte, thus making her empress, and also consolidating family power. Charlotte was sent to live with Madame Mere in Paris (March, 1810) but Napoleon did not favour a marriage with his niece. Charlotte, her father and stepmother Alexandrine, and her siblings and household were later captured by the British (Aug, 1810) whilst enroute for America, and were forced to reside in England until the fall of Napoleon (1814).\n\nWith his short return to power Charlotte was then granted the title of Princesse of France (March 22, 1815) with the qualification of Imperial Highness. Princess Charlotte was then married in Rome (Dec 27, 1815) to the Italian peer Prince Mario Gabrielli (1773 â 1841) and became the Princess Gabrielli (1815 â 1841). An outspoken and undevious woman the Italians referred to Princess Gabrielli as âa true Bonaparte.â Her surviving letters were full of Imperial court gossip in Paris, and her own behaviour in society was sometimes a source of concern for the French Imperial family. Nevertheless, with the fall of Napoleon, her fortune and that of her own children was safe, but she always remained loyal to the Bonaparte family, particularly to her grandmother Madame Mere to whom she remained attached until her death (1839). Charlotte survived her husband as the Dowager Princess Gabrielli (1841 â 1865) and the the following year she quietly remarried to her faithful admirer the Cavaliere Settimio Centamori. With the rise of Emperor Napoleon III the princess was officially recognized as Princesse Bonaparte with the qualification of Highness (Feb 21, 1853).

Sources which claim that Gaitelgrima was also married to her husbandâs brother Count Humphrey (Onofrio) (died 1057), and was still living as his widow (1091) are mistaken, this lady must have been an unnamed sister.\n\nGaither, Frances Ormond â (1889 â 1955)\n\nAmerican author and biographer\n\nBorn Frances Jones (May 21, 1889), in Somerville, Tennessee, she was the granddaughter of a cotton planter.

She specialized in watercolour paintings of flowers and native grasses. One of her works which depicted thistles was exhibited at the Royal Academy.\n\nGale, June â (1911 â 1996)\n\nAmerican film and television actress and vocalist\n\nJune Gilmartin was born (July 6, 1911) at San Francisco in California, into a theatrical family. As a child she performed in vaudeville with her siblings as The Gale Sisters, and they appeared together in the film Poor Little Rich Boy (1932). Thereafter Gale appeared in small film roles, often as a band member or a dancer such as in Folies-Bergere de Paris (1935), Folies-Bergere (1936), One in a Million (1936) and Thin Ice (1937).\n\nGale was married firstly (1939) to the pianist and composer Oscar Levant (1906 â 1972) and under her married name of June Levant she appeared in the film Pigskin Parade (1936).

Susannah Gale died (Sept 1, 1906) aged eighty-two, in Sydney.\n\nGale, Zona â (1874 â 1938)\n\nAmerican novelist, story writer and dramatist\n\nZona Gale was born (Aug 26, 1874) in Portage, Wisconsin, and attended college in that town. She attended the University of Wisconsin, and worked as a journalist in Milwaukee and in Hew York. Her first published work was the overly sentimental novel, Romance Island (1906), though her literary talent remained evident. Increasingly drawn towards feminism and the fight for female suffrage, Gale also held strong pacifist views. Her novel Birth (1918), was later adapted for the stage under the title of, Mr Pitt (1924), but she achieved real public recognition and fame for her real-life depictions of life in the midwest for her popular novel, Miss Lulu Brett (1920), and she received the Pulitzer Prize (1921) for the stage version. Her other novels included, Papa le Fleur (1933), and the story anthology, Yellow Gentians and Blue (1927). Gale was a strong supporter of the suffrage campaign to enfranchise women, and was an admirer of the work accomplished by Jane Addams at Hull House.

Catterina later returned and made a second tour of England (1720 â 1721). Her roles during this visit included Agenor in, Astarte, Tigrane in, Radamisto, Amulio in, Numitore, and Lucio Tarquinio in, Muzio Scevola. Details of her later career are unknown.\n\nGaleria Copiola â (fl. c100 â c70 BC)\n\nRoman actress\n\nGaleria Copiola almost certainly of slave status, and had been manumitted by a member of the Galerii gens, who would almost certainly have arranged for her to be trained for the stage. A performer of some considerable talent, she was famous enough to be recorded by the elder Pliny, who referred to her as an emboliara grandaeva, or an elderly dramatic actress.\n\nGaleria Fundana â (c37 â after 70 AD)Â\n\nRoman Augusta (69 AD)\n\nGaleria Fundana was perhaps the daughter or sister of Publius Galerius Trachalus, consul ord. (68 AD). Galeria was married (c57 AD) as his second wife, to the Emperor Vitellius (15 â 69 AD), who granted the title of Augusta to his wife and mother Sextilia at the same time (69 AD). Galeria moved with her children and mother-in-law into the famous palace of Nero but both women felt distinctly uncomfortable in such opulent surroundings. Neither she nor Sextilia were seduced by the hollow flattery of court life. Dio strangely accuses Galeria Fundana of haughtily complaining of the poor quality of the Imperial robes that she found in the palace, but the testaments to her modesty are too strong to give credence to this stsatement.\n\nWhen Vespasian and his army reached Rome, they came upon Vitellius, Galeria Fundana and their daughter, who had emerged from the Capitol, all dressed in mouring for the Augusta Sextilia who has recently died. As his precarious reign had dissolved into chaos, Vitellius offered to resign the Imperial throne, but he was killed by the mob. The empress and her children remained unmolested. Her son Vitellius Germanicus (62 â 70 AD) was killed by Mucianus as a political danger to the Flavian dynasty, but the empress herself was left unharmed and granted an income by the new Flavian dynasty. Tacitus in his Histories alludes to a home in Rome that was the empressâs personal property. Her surviving child Vitellia Fundana was treated as an Imperial princess, and was provided with a suitable dowry by the emperor Vespasian (70 â 79 AD). Through this daughter Galeria Fundana was the ancestress of the Antonine Dynasty.\n\nGalgai, Leonora â (1571 â 1617)Â\n\nItalian courtier\n\nLeonora Galgai was of Florentine birth, and was the childhood companion of Marie de Medici, who became the second wife (1599) of Henry IV of France, and whom she accompanied to the French court. She was married (1601) to the dashingly handsome courtier, Concino Concini, and the two worked together to enrich themselves at the expense of the French royal coffers.\n\nSmall, thin, and ugly, Leonora nevertheless managed to ingratiate herself with many prominent courtiers, such as the kingâs mistress Henriette de Verneuil, for whom she obtained (1601) the position of Mistress of the Robes to the queen. With the death of the king (1610) Marie de Medici assumed the regency for Louis XIII, and Concini was made marquis dâAncre. During this period the couple enjoyed boundless power, which they used to enrich themselves, and were the causes of great friction between the queen, the king, and their respective supporters. In 1616 Leonora was one of the chief ladies who greeted the kingâs bride, Anne of Austria, upon her arrival in Paris. Finally, despite the protests of Queen Marie, Louis XIII assumed full power (1617). On April 24, Concini was shot by a royal guard on the drawbridge of the Louvre Palace, and Leonora was made prisoner by the kingâs supporters. In May following, Leonora was condemned to death for sorcery, despite pleas for her release made by the queen mother. Leonora was beheaded and her body burned (July 8, 1617).\n\nGalgani, Gemma â (1878 â 1903)\n\nItalian Catholic nun and saint\n\nGalgani was born (March 12, 1878) at Camigliano, near Lucca, and was raised by relatives after the deaths of her parents. She experienced mystical visions and the signs of the stigmata. The priest who recorded the phenomena she evidence was so impressed, that he became her biographer. Gemma Galgani died (April 11, 1903) at Lucques, aged only twenty-five.\n\nGalgoczi, Erszebet â (1930 â 1989)\n\nHungarian novelist\n\nGalgoczi was born (Aug 27, 1930) at Gyor in western Hungary. She was raised under the new Communist regime and her novels portrayed rural farming life. Her works included Vidravas (Otter Trap) (1984) which dealt with the 1956 uprising, the novels A Kozos Bun (Common Sin) (1976), Kinek torvenye? (Whose Law?) (1971), and Bizonyitek nincs (There Is No Proof) (1976). Galgoczi later worked in Budapest as a journalist, and was the recipient of the Joszef Attila Prize (1976) and the Kossuth Prize (1987). Galgoczi was for several years a member of the Hungarian parliament. Erszebet Galgoczi died of cancer (May 20, 1989) aged fifty-eight, at Menfocsanak.\n\nGaliena â (fl. 1209)\n\nEnglish medieval witchtrial victim\n\nGaliena was a native of Norfolk, and was accused by her neighbour Agnes, the wife of Odo. She was arrested and taken to trial but she denied all guilt. Galiena cleared herself by successfully undergoing the ordeal of the hot iron.\n\nGalilei, Maria Celeste â (1600 â 1634)\n\nItalian nun and letter writer\n\nBorn Virginia Gamba (Aug 13, 1600) in Padua, she was the illegitimate daughter of the famous astronomer Galileo Galilei and Marina Gamba. She was raised with her sister Livia in a convent in Florence. Virginia later took the veil in the Clarissan convent of San Matteo (1616) at Arcetri, near Florence, where she served as apothecary to the sisters. She took the name of Maria Celeste in religion. Almost one hundred and twenty-five of her letters to her father (1623 â 1633) have survived. They were edited and published in the twentieth century (1935). She may have prepared the manuscripts for several of her fatherâs books. Maria Celeste Galilei died (April 2, 1634) aged thirty-three, of dysentery, in Florence.\n\nGalina, G.A. â (1870? â 1942)\n\nRussian poet and childrenâs writer\n\nBorn Glafira Adolfovna Mamoshina, she originally worked as a telegraphist (1890 â 1896). Galina published collections of verse such as, Poems (1902) and Pre-Dawn Songs (1906), as well as several collections of fairy-tales. She composed a poem on the Boer War (1899 â 1902) in Africa, which later became a popular folk-song, and emigrated with her second husband after the 1917 revolution.\n\nGalindo, Beatrix â (1474 â 1535)\n\nSpanish humanist scholar\n\nBeatrix Galindo was born in Salamanca, and may have been educated in Italy. She had resisted her parents wish that she become a nun, and devoted herself to scholarly pursuits. On account of her prestigious learning, she was appointed as a professor of philosophy, rhetoric and medicine at the University of Salamanca. Because of her learning she was popularly known as âLa Latina,â and was made tutor to Queen Isabella I of Castile. Her husband, Francisco Ramirez, was a soldier by profession, and became the secretary to King Ferdinand V, husband of Isabella. Beatrix Galindo wrote Latin verses, and commentaries on the works of Aristotle and other classical authors. She founded several schools and hospitals throughout Spain, including one in Madrid which she endowed and in which she was buried at her death.\n\nGalitzina, Adelaide Amalia von Schmettau, Princess â (1748 â 1806)\n\nGerman Pietist\n\nBorn Adelaide von Schmettau (Aug 28, 1748) in Berlin, Prussia, she was the daughter of General von Schmettau, and in 1768 she married Prince Dmitri Galitzine (1738 â 1803) the Russian ambassador to the courts of The Hague and Versailles. From 1766 she served as a lady-in-waiting to Princess Louise of Prussia. A woman of well known literary tastes, and an extraordinarily amiable disposition, she became noted for her piety, culture, grace and adherence to the Catholic faith. Adelaide later seperated from her husband, and went to reside at Munster in Westphalia, where she established a circle of pietists. The famous conversion of Count Friedrich Leopold von Stolberg to the Roman Catholic Church (1800) took place in the princessâs private chapel at Munster. It was due to her influence that her son prince Dmitri Augustine Dmitrivitch Galitzine (1770 â 1841) became a Roman Catholic in 1795, and was later ordained as a priest in America. Princess Adelaide died (April 27, 1806) at Munster, aged fifty-seven.\n\nGalitzina, Catherine Helene von Carlow, Princess â (1891 â 1940)\n\nGerman-Anglo royal\n\nBorn Countess Catherine von Carlow (Aug 6, 1891) at Oranienbaum, near St Petersburg, Russia, she was the first daughter of Duke George Alexander of Mecklenburg-Strelitz (1859 â 1909) by his morganatic marriage with Natalia Feodorovna Wonliarsky (1858 â 1921), created Countess von Carlow, and bore her motherâs title and rank from birth. Countess Catherine was married at St Petersburg (1913) to Prince Vladimir Emmanuelovitch Galitzine (1884 â 1954), as his first wife.

Three of her still-life works preserved in the Pinocoteca Civica of Cremona are thought to be examples of Galiziaâs later paintings, though many other unidentifiable still-lifes are rather doubtfully attributed to her.

Yvonne Gall died (Aug 21, 1972) aged eighty-seven, in Paris.\n\nGalla â (fl. c390 â c410 AD)\n\nGallo-Roman patrician\n\nGalla became the wife of Eucherius from a senatorial family. With her husband Galla was the recipient of a letter from Paulinus, Bishop of Nola, recorded his his Epistulae which styled her clarissima femina. She was also mentioned in the Vita Consortiae and in the Consolationes of John Cassian. She retired with her husband Eucherius to live the religious life at the Abbey of Lerins. Eucherius was appointed as Bishop of Lyons whilst Galla took vows as a nun.\n\nApart from two daughters named Consortia and Tullia of whom nothing is known except their names, Galla was the mother of two sons, Salonius who had been appointed as bishop of Geneva by 439 AD and was still living (c455 AD) when he attended the Council of Arles, and Veronius (living c475 AD) who had become Bishop of Vence by 450 AD.\n\nGalla, Aurelia â (c490 AD â c540)\n\nRoman patrician\n\nAurelia Galla was the daughter of Quintus Aurelius Memmius Symmachus, prefect of Rome (476 â 491 AD), consul (485 AD), later put to death by Theodoric of Italy, and was sister to Rusticiana, the wife of Severinus Boethius. Galla was married in her youth, but was widowed after only one year. Soon afterwards, Fulgentius, Bishop of Ruspe wrote her a letter (dated c508 â c523) on the theme of widowhood. This missive is preserved in his Epistulae and in it he referred to Galla as dominae vere illustri et in Christi timore venerabili filiae Gallae. Deciding against remarriage, Galla chose to embrace the religious life, and necame a nun in the monastery of St Peter in Rome. Galla died there of breast cancer, after a life devoted to religious piety and charitable concerns, and was said to have had visions of St Peter on her deathbed. Regarded as a saint, her feast (Oct 3) is recorded in the Roman Martyrology and in the Acta Sanctorum.\n\nGalla, Flavia Julia â (c324 â 352 AD)\n\nRoman Augusta (350 â 352 AD).\n\nFlavia Julia Galla was the only daughter of Prince Flavius Julius Constantinus and his first wife Neratia Galla, the sister of consul Neratius Cerealis, and was paternal granddaughter of the Emperor Constantius I Chlorus (293 â 306 AD) and his second wife Flavia Maxima Theodora. She was married (c340 AD) to her cousin Constantius III (317 â 361 AD) as his first wife, the marriage being designed to unite the two branches of the Imperial house. There were no children. With her husbandâs accession Galla was accorded the rank of Augusta (350 AD) but she remains a shadowy figure.\n\nGalla, Neratia â (c305 â 327 AD)\n\nRoman Imperial princess\n\nNeratia Galla was the daughter of a wealthy consular family that held high court offices for several generations. She was the sister of the two consuls Vulcacius (347 AD) and Neratius Cerealis (358 AD). She became the first wife (c322 AD) of Prince Flavius Julius Constantinus (c302 â 337 AD), a younger son of the Emperor Constantius I Chlorus (293 â 306 AD) and half-brother to the Emperor Constantine I the Great (306 â 337 AD). Galla resided with her husband in Tuscany and in Korinth in Greece but died, probably from the effects of childbirth, before Julius moved his family to Constantinople. Her three children were Flavia Julia Galla (c324 â 352) the first wife of the Emperor Constantius II (317 â 361 AD), the future Emperor Gallus (325 â 354 AD) who married Flavia Constantina, daughter of Constantine I but died childless, and an unnamed son who was murdered with his father during the purge of the Imperial house (337 AD).\n\nGalla, Valentinia â (370 â 394 AD)\n\nRoman Augusta (387 â 394 AD)\n\nValentinia Galla was the eldest daughter of the Emperor Valentinian I and his second wife Aviana Justina, the widow of the Emperor Magnentius. She was the elder sister of Emperor Valentinian II (383 â 392 AD). With her fatherâs death (375 AD) Galla and her two sisters Justa and Grata were removed with their mother to the Imperial palace at Milan in Lombardy where they resided until 387 AD. When Magnus Maximus invaded Italy the family fled to the court of Theodosius I at Constantinople for safety.\n\nThe Dowager Empress Justina staged a dramastic scene presenting her daughters before Theodosisu. Beautiful and accomplished Galla made a favourable impression upon the widowed Theodosius who then asked Justina for her hand. In return Justina asked that Theodosius avenge the murder of her stepson the Emperor Gratian. He agreed and Theodosius and Galla were married in Constantinople (387 AD). They spent the next winter with Gallaâs brother valentinian II in Thessalonika and soon afterwards her mother and sisters returned by sea to Rome. She became stepmother to the emperors Arcadius (395 â 408 AD) and Honorius (408 â 423 AD) and though Theodosius adored her Gallaâs relationship with Arcadius was anything but friendly. When Theodosius left for the west (390 AD) leaving Arcadius in power in Constantinople, he and Empress Galla took a violent dislike to each other. This ended with Arcadius expelling his stepmother and her infant daughter from the palace. However with the return of Theodosius the empress was restored to her position, and stepmother and stepson were reluctantly reconciled. Empress Galla died in Constantinople (April, 394 AD) aged only twenty-three, from the effects of childbirth. Gallaâs importance was only dynastic, her two sons Gratian (392 AD) and Johannes (394 AD) died in infancy, and her only surviving child was the famous Empress Galla Placidia, the mother of Valentinian III.\n\nGalla Placidia, Aelia â (388 â 450 AD)Â\n\nRoman Augusta (417 â 450 AD)\n\nAelia Galla Placidia was the daughter of Emperor Theodosius I (379 â 394 AD) and his second wife Valentina Galla, the daughter of Emperor Valentinian I. She was the younger half-sister to the emperors Arcadius and Honorius. From 397 AD she was raised and educated in the household of the Dowager Empress Laeta, the widow of Gratian in Rome. Galla Placidia was taken hostage during the sack of Rome (410 AD) by the Visigoth king Alaric, and was later married (414 AD) at Narbonne, in Gaul, to his successor Athaulf. Their only son Theodosius died an infant. With Athaulfâs murder (415 AD) the Goths subjected her to some mistreatment but eventually handed her back to Rome.\n\nGalla Placidia was then forced by her brother to marry Constantius (363 â 421 AD) general to Honorius, at Ravenna (417 AD). By Constantius she was the mother of the emperor Valentinian III and of Justa Grata Honoria. After quarrelling with her brother, Placidia fled to the court of Constantinople (423 AD). She was later restored to power in Rome with the backing of an eastern army. The usurper Johannes was suppressed and her six year old son Valentinian was installed in Rome as emperor (Oct 23, 425 AD), with the empress as regent. Her influence remained paramount for some time, but eventually the influence of the military commander Aetius rose in ascendancy and from about 433 AD his influence displaced that of the empress mother. The empress now devoted herself to works of religious patronage and charity, and built churches and her famous mausoleum in the Church of the Holy Cross, in Ravenna. When her daughter Honoria plotted with the court official Hyacinthus to offer her hand to King Attila of the huns, Placidia had to personally intervene to save her daughterâs life when the plan was discovered. Empress Galla Placidia died (Nov 27, 450 AD) aged sixty-two, in Rome. Her famous tomb in Ravenna which had a life-sized figure of Galla Placidia seated on a throne of cypress-wood, survived several hundred years before being accidentally destroyed in a fire, caused by two children playing with matches. She was commemorated on the coinage by a surviving gold solidus minted in Ravenna (c430 AD).

Therefore his brothers cast him from the kingdom, deeming that the aforesaid queen was not slain without his prompting.â\n\nChilperic soon regained his kingdom but this murder was the beginning of the deadly and destructive feud that existed thereafter for three decades between Fredegonde and Chilpericâs sister-in-law, the famous Brunhilda the wife of Sigebert I, King of Austrasia, who was Galswinthaâs younger sister.
