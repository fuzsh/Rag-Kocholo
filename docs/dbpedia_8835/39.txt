Exeter City FC wanted to improve its old and outdated 1920s structures and the solutions delivered mark a superior improvement in the overall facilities. After a period of consultation, Stadia by GL events worked closely with Exeter City Council to overcome several challenges, ensuring the project was delivered on schedule and within budget.

The impressive new Stagecoach Adam Stansfield stand at St James Park has seating for 1,600 football supporters. It’s built on a concrete structure and features a protective cantilever roof and glazed side panels. Its red and white seating is arranged to spell out the letters ‘ECFC’ – maximising the overall brand appeal.

Our design incorporated a raised disabled access platform which complies with disability, safety and building regulations, so that all supporters can enjoy their favourite sport in safety and comfort. Supporters also gained a new and improved toilet block facility, bar-fit-out and concessions.

Redevelopment works at Exeter City FC started in the off-season. The new facilities were then ready for the official opening, sixteen months later.
