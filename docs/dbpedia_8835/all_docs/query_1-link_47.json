I have something he will want.\" \"You are bluffing,\" said Sir Evelyn but did not call his dogs forward. \"What do you have?\" Gregov took a deep breath, \"London is going to be destroyed by a weapon of mass destruction.\" \"How do you know?\" \"Because,\" said Gregov. \"I sold the weapon.\" So starts the race to save London, led by an SAS major dishonourably discharged from the army, a young man still at university and three old men, an assassin, an intelligence expert and a breaker of men. If they fail, the world as we know it will cease to exist.\n\n\"synopsis\" may belong to another edition of this title."
