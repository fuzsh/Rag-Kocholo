        "text": "The Exeter City Supporters‚Äô Trust are proud to reveal the brand-new Surfer Flag to be passed along the Thatcher‚Äôs Big Bank.\n\nThe flag, which measures 15m x 10m features the ‚ÄúProud to be Supporter Owned, since 2003‚Äù badge on a red background.\n\nTo celebrate everyone who has made the past twenty years so successful, the flag also features the surnames of every adult Trust member signed up before September 1, 2023, embossed in the design.\n\nOur story is a unique one, being saved from possible liquidation in 2003, by the hard working and generous Trust members who funded the sale of the club back in September 2003. Across the last twenty years, our membership has grown, and so have our success on and off the pitch because of it.\n\nThe Trust‚Äôs biggest strength has been and always will be its membership and this long-term design is a great way for us to celebrate together, everyone who has made the last 20 years possible.\n\nThe idea of the Trust surfer flag came from the Communications Working Group, headed by Julen Beer Ayo, due to the age, wear and tear of the previous Adam Stansfield Shirt which has graced the Big Bank for the last 12 years.\n\nThis likely will not be the last time we see the Adam Stansfield Flag which has become an iconic sight for City fans on the Big Bank and at Wembley Stadium, as we cherished Stanno‚Äôs story over the years, though natural wear and tear to the flag has limited its use in the last few years.\n\nThe Comms group believe, as we commemorate the twentieth anniversary of Trust Ownership, now is a great time to semi-retire the Stanno Flag and create a new surfer flag for the future.\n\nBoth the club and Trust are also looking at options to repair the Adam Stansfield Flag and will keep fans updated on the progress.\n\nThe flag will first be revealed and used on the Big Bank ahead of Saturday‚Äôs twentieth-anniversary celebration match against Leyton Orient on September 9.\n\nWe will be looking for a couple of volunteers to help unfurl the flag, so if you would like to help please head down to the front of the Big Bank around 20/30 minutes before kick-off."
