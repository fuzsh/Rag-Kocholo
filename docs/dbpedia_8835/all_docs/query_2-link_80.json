        "text": "Birmingham City have been the subject of a staggering 78% of all League One bets placed through Oddschecker this season. Blues, having dropped down to the third tier from the Championship on the final day of last season, have been engulfed in excitement and optimism as the new campaign looms with the hosting of Reading on Saturday.\n\nKnighthead have ensured that Blues have a transfer budget which is the envy of most Championship clubs; indeed only one or two in the second tier, those aiming for promotion to the Premier League, have actually spent more on recruiting players this summer. They've so far brought in a wealth of exciting talent and potential.\n\nAlfie May, last year's League One Golden Boot winner, heads those arrivals, along with Emil Hansson, Willum Willumsson, Bailey Peacock-Farrell, Ryan Allsop, Christoph Klarer, Ryan Leonard, Luke Harris and Alex Cochrane. New boss Chris Davies has presided over a largely impressive set of pre-season friendly results, too.\n\nREAD: Birmingham City vs Reading team news for League One opener\n\nREAD: Birmingham City and Alfie May tipped for success as League One odds revealed\n\nBlues' financial muscle and firepower in League One, compared to that of their rivals who would aim to challenge them at the top end of the table, means that they are big favourites to return to the Championship at the first time of asking. Generally speaking they're as short as 9/4 to be crowned champions and claim the title.\n\nOddschecker have confirmed now that Blues winning League One accounts for 78% of all third tier bets placed. To put that into context, Manchester United have been the most backed to win the Premier League with 21% of all top flight bets. Leeds United have been backed by 28% of all Championship gamblers to win the second tier, while Port Vale account for 31% of all League Two bets to clinch that title."
