        "text": "I've grown to like Craig Bellamy a lot over recent years but his threat to never kick a ball again if City don't name him in their squad grated.\n\nHe's 31, played arguably the best football of his career last season and is currently being pursued by some of the best managers in Britain.\n\nTake a reality check on your life Craig. Or let me give you one.\n\nAnother 31-year-old striker, Adam Stansfield, played arguably the best football of his career last season for Exeter. Until it was cut short in early April when he was diagnosed with colorectal cancer.\n\nHe died this week. Leaving behind, not the sister Lisa that Jeff Stelling used to refer to whenever he scored on a Saturday afternoon, but a wife and three boys.\n\nWhat they, and everyone else who knew him, would give to see Adam kicking a ball again.\n\nThink about it Craig.\n\n*********\n\nPeople who slag off players retiring from international duty must lead pretty sad lives.\n\nIf a 30-something decides he can't be bothered traipsing around the world's hotels as third-choice patsy in a team that wins only dog's abuse, surely that's up to him?\n\nYet there they were again, those plastic patriots, tearing into Paul Robinson and Wes Brown for packing in international football.\n\nIn this of all weeks. When internationals interrupted the build-up to the return of REAL football, with games about as relevant to our lives as the result of the election of a dog warden in Hokapalokaville, New Mexico (pop: 64). Let it go eh?\n\n*********\n\nI'm as disgusted as the next Englishman that Fabio Capello didn't make that phone-call to David Beckham. He should have picked up the phone. Two years ago.\n\nAnd said: \"David, you are 33, a part-time dead-ball taker for a Hollywood circus troupe, underwear model and brand-spreader. But you are not an international footballer. So I'm not going to bow to a skint FA and a mawkish nation who want me to let you stand inside the touch-line for three minutes at the end of every friendly until you beat Pete Shilton's caps record. That would be a pathetic indictment on a once-great player and a once-great country. Arriverderci.\"\n\nThat we're still debating it is an ever bigger indictment."
