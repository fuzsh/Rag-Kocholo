        "text": "Exeter City’s legendary players to have a “seat” in the crowd at Wembley playoff game\n\nMeasures introduced by the club to help fans attend the match in ‘virtual form’ means 12 much-loved players will join their fellow Grecians in the capital.\n\nThousands of Exeter City fans have paid to have their faces put on environmentally friendly cut-outs, which will be taken to Wembley and placed in the stands to create an audience with a difference.\n\nUniversity of Exeter heritage experts, who have worked with the club and the Supporter’s Trust to create the ECFC Museum and Grecian Archive, have collaborated with the club’s commercial and marketing teams to make sure that members of the club’s official Hall of Fame will be in the stadium.\n\nThe Hall of Fame recognises and celebrates the character and achievements of individuals in representing the club.\n\nThose going to Wembley include Adam Stansfield, Dick Pym, Reg Clarke, Sid Thomas, Alan Banks, Dermot Curtis, Peter Hatch, Tony Kellow, Graham Rees, Cliff Bastin, Arnold Mitchell and Jimmy Giles.\n\nThe club initially launched its Grecian in the Ground campaign for the League Two play-off semi-final against Colchester United, when the coronavirus pandemic meant that the match had to be played behind closed doors.\n\nThe final at Wembley Stadium will also be played without fans physically present, and so the Supporters’ Trust, which owns the majority shareholding of the club, has made sure that all of the cut-outs will be there to represent the fan-base in the capital for this crucial game.\n\nDr Will Barrett, from the University of Exeter, ECFC Museum and Grecian Archive, said: “These players have stood out in some of the most memorable sides to appear at St James Park, and as individuals they have set standards, both on and off the pitch, that have set them apart from their peers as Exeter City legends.\n\n“We are delighted that they will ‘join’ other fans at Wembley for this historic game. As heart breaking as it is that the club’s incredible supporters can’t be there to watch it in person, we at least have the chance to make sure that Exeter City’s proud history and incredible fan-base is represented at Wembley.\n\n“I’m sure people will enjoy trying to spot all the faces in the crowd, as well as cheering for Matt Taylor and the team on what will be another special occasion for our football club.”\n\nThe ECFC Museum and Grecian Archive is ran in collaboration between the University of Exeter, Exeter City Football Club, the ECFC Supporters’ Trust, and is supported by the National Lottery Heritage Fund."
