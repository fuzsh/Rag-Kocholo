It arrived beautifully packed with lovely hand-written and decorated labels. Really pleased with the way it now looks framed, and hung behind my bird collection.\n\nResponse from Sharon Hiley\n\n26 Oct 2018\n\nThank you so much for your reviews. I have just looked up the jug you refer to and I can see the connection! You sound to have a beautiful collection of work.
