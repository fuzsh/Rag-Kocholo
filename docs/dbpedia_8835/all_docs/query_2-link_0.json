        "text": "He is OFF THE MARK! 💥 Erling Haaland celebrated his 100th appearance for Manchester City by finding the net, bringing his goal tally to 91 🤯 To achieve this level of dominance in just TWO seasons is simply extraordinary… His rapid rise is a prime example of how nurturing talent is key to building a high-performing organisation. Is another golden boot pending? 👀\n\nThis is SHOCKING for some, but not for me 👀 Having spent nearly two decades in elite football, this behaviour was relatively common (and is) completely accepted in this world. This is actually a light \"telling-off\" compared to what I’ve seen... However, as a Founder and CEO in the business world, I recognise the importance of fostering a respectful and constructive workplace culture. I do wonder how my HR & Training Manager would react if I had this type of outburst on one of my Fulfilment team members for packing the wrong shots in a box 😅 What makes this type of behaviour acceptable in the world of elite sports and unacceptable in a business/office environment? Asking for a friend 😉\n\nHave you seen the news about the ASA banning ads for Huel and Zoe?! We’ve experienced similar frustrations at The Turmeric Co. 😔 But there's a clear difference between a genuine customer experience and a misleading celebrity endorsement…. 🔬 We’ve gone a step beyond to clinically validate our products through independent trials. 🧫 We’ve analysed blood samples of those who take our shots and those who don't, proving the efficacy of our formula. ❌ We’ve been banned from openly sharing testimonials that rave about the relief that our turmeric shots bring to inflammation and aches. Apparently, that's \"misleading\" according to the ASA. The science is there, the lived experiences are there, and the impact is undeniable. Time for guidelines to be updated, and for small businesses to be empowered to share authentic customer stories 👏\n\nThis is insane 🤯 Team GB’s Rose Harvey has revealed that she finished the Olympic women’s marathon with a broken leg! After battling hip pain from the second mile, she completed the race with a stress fracture. AND still completed the race in under 3 hours… 😅 Can you imagine the mental and physical strength it took to push through that pain? The power of the mind is unstoppable 👏\n\nA sign of desperation or innovation? 😅 Coca-Cola and Oreo are set to launch a limited-edition cola (I thought this was a late April Fools too! 🤣) For me, this just shows how the beverage industry is at a crossroads. While some brands are opting for short-term gains with sugary collaborations, others are investing in products that truly care about consumer health. The Turmeric Co. and Raw Hydrate will set a new benchmark for the industry, one that actually cares about the health of our generation and the next. It’s time for change 🤝\n\nThe Olympic dream is alive and well in Britain! A YouGov poll revealed that 27% of Brits believe they could qualify for the 2028 Olympics if they started training today 🤯 The real question is: who's signing up for the 10m Air Rifle trials? 15% of the population seem to think they've got what it takes… Andy Murray’s response is brilliant - I’d love to see the % of people who reckon they could play pro football 👀\n\nA craze no-one could have predicted 😅 Paris 2024 delivered countless iconic moments, but one athlete stole the show without even securing gold... Yusuf Dikeç's silver-winning shooting stance became the signature victory pose across Olympic sports 🔫🤣 He’s even appeared in a mural too! Sometimes, authenticity and originality can outshine any polished marketing campaign. I reckon we’ll see a few 'The Dikeçit’ celebrations this season… ⚽️\n\nA victory 40 years in the making! 🇵🇰🥇 Arshad Nadeem’s Olympic gold is a historic moment for Pakistan. Setting a new Olympic record of 92.97m, he’s secured the nation’s first-ever individual gold medal in athletics. What stands out for me is the contrast between his journey and the commercialised landscape of today's Olympics. While many athletes are affiliated with major sports brands, Arshad has defied the odds to succeed despite minimal support and a lack of training facilities. His early career was even funded by his villagers, who chipped in to help him compete!!! This gold medal is the product of pure, organic talent, relentless drive, and human spirit 👏"
