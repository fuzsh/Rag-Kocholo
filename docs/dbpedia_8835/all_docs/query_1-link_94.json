        "text": "MANFY SHARPE, EXETER CITY WOMEN’S TEAM\n\nLast weekend saw a focus on Women’s football, with the Women’s Football Weekend. Over 70,000 supporters attended games in the Super League as the Women’s game continues to grow in communities throughout the country. With the success and national television exposure of the England National team this summer, the WSL has seen crowds increase by 47%. That growth is without including the high profile games played at the men’s home stadium, such as the 31,000 that watched the Manchester derby at the Etihad Stadium in September. Arguably, Women’s football has never been in a better place, and after hitting over 100 goals in a promotion winning season last year, Exeter City Women’s team are following that upward trajectory. This week I was able to get the thoughts on Women’s football at SJP from Manfy Sharpe.\n\nWith names such as Megan Rapinoe and Ellen White hitting both front and back pages over the summer, Manfy feels that there is a change in how Women’s football is starting to be viewed. “I think that the women’s world cup being televised has helped certain spectators open their mind to women’s football that perhaps wouldn’t have before, maybe just to begin watching more often or even to get playing. The progress of the England Women’s team is giving young girls role models, when I was younger I never had that. I wanted to be Paul Scholes! It can only be a positive for young people to aspire to be strong and successful athletes.”\n\nParticipation is perhaps the most important step forward, 2.6 million women stated that they played football during the month of June, a record number. Since October the Community Trust has been running sessions at the Exwick Sports Hub designed to get women of all ages and abilities playing. It’s free to go so worth a look. Exeter City Football club has a positive transitional set up for Women, from the Wildcats for young girls, to the Development Centre as they progress. The partnership with Exeter College will then oversee the passage into the Women’s team. This partnership has already reaped rewards as Georgie Barbour Gresham was been called up to the England College’s U19 team, something that Manfy feels is well deserved. “We are all so chuffed for Georgie, it’s a massive achievement but she really does deserve it, she always works so hard in training. Georgie is a fantastic player to play with and a massive character too, I’m really pleased for her.”\n\nManfy started at Exeter City in 2015, winning the Player of the Year in 2017, and has noticed plenty of change in that time. “We, as a Women’s team, are really lucky to have the backing of the club, many Women’s teams don’t have that. From posts on the social media account, having our photo’s done in the same facilities as the first team and hearing about our fixtures over the tannoy on game days at SJP, it makes us feel really involved with the club. I think Exeter is a forward thinking club, with things like the annual Women’s day at SJP and “Lexi” the Lion, they are really supportive of women in football.”\n\nA big step forward for the Women’s team was last season’s cup match against Buckland Athletic being held at SJP. 2012 had been the last occasion Women’s football had been played at the venue and that day a crowd of 162 watched City take on Brislington in the FA Cup. 606 were in attendance to see an entertaining game in February, with Matt Taylor offering his support from the stands. “We were so pleased to have the opportunity to play at SJP, it was a massive occasion for all of us and to have such a turnout of people to come and watch made it even more special.” With Women’s football growing, both in terms of professionalism and involvement, and the WSL even securing overseas TV deals the chances of seeing more fixtures at SJP looks likely. “I think the way we are progressing in some of the cup competitions there may be an opportunity to play there again this year. It’s always going to be special to play in such an environment, so I think it would definitely be good, but at the same time the facilities at Cullumpton, where we play our home games, are really good. It’s like our own little fortress.”\n\nWith all areas of the club from Julian, Social Media, the Community Trust and the Supporters Trust all turning attention towards the women’s team a successful future looks possible. Yeovil Town, a club similar to ourselves, competed in the top flight last season. They averaged crowds over 700 and in 2017 drew close to 1,900 in a fixture against Liverpool. Is the ambition to match our Somerset neighbours achievements? “Definitely. I think we have to have the ambition and desire to want to be the best of the best. With the players coming through the Girls Development Centre having such huge potential, it is hard not to see the team doing really well in the future.”\n\nWomen’s football continues to be met with a degree of ignorance. Sensitive souls will continued to be triggered by someone like Rapinoe, but opinions are changing. “I believe they are. Since the Women’s World Cup more people talk about it and want to come and watch. I do think there will always be people that are not willing to open their mind to it and that’s fine, but they are missing out.”\n\nExeter City Women’s team have responded well to the step up this season and are having a very solid league campaign under the management of Abbie Britton and Clive Watts. Women’s football is here to stay and is being embraced at SJP. Manfy is confident that both she and the club will continue moving forward in the future. “I would like to continue playing and improving with Exeter City for quite a while and building myself with the team. I really enjoy the setup here, I don’t think I’d get the support and coaching that I get at Exeter City anywhere else. I am ambitious to be the best I can be and I think I will achieve that here.”\n\nSHAUN PARKIN OF THE ADAM STANSFIELD FOUNDATION\n\nAs the players enter the pitch at St. James Park, a familiar drum beat begins, applause gradually grows in rhythm and volume as those in attendance rise to “sing a song for our Stanno.”\n\nBorn in 1978, Adam Stansfield began his career playing Non League Football for Cullompton and Elmore. It would be at the later age of 23 that he would sign his first Professional contract, then Yeovil Town manager, Gary Johnson bringing him to Huish Park in 2001. Adam finished as the leading scorer for the Glovers in his first season, sixteen goals, including eight in the club’s successful FA Trophy run. Scoring the second in a 2-0 victory over Stevenage at the Millennium Stadium, Cardiff, would conclude an exciting first year in the Professional game. Unfortunately, Adam suffered a broken fibula and tibia on the first day of the following season and his progress was curtailed. Yeovil Town would go on to win the Conference title that season and Stanno would only feature sporadically the following year as Gary Johnson’s side adjusted to life in the Football League and the player himself returned from long term injury. However, during Adam’s first season in the Football League he would hit six goals, including his first against, then League Two side, Swansea City, showing he had the capability to perform at a higher level.\n\nAfter leaving Somerset in the summer of 2004, Adam headed to Hereford United. An excellent first season would see a return of 24 goals, a career best. Hereford would narrowly miss out on promotion that season, losing in the Semi Final to Stevenage. The following year would prove more successful, Adam started the game in a 3-2 Extra Time victory against Halifax Town, as Herford won the Play Off Final and gained promotion to the Football League.\n\nSo to 2006. Whilst inbetween the management tenures of Ingelthorpe and Tisdale, the board brought Adam to SJP. Stanno would go on to score 37 in 142 appearances for the mighty Grecians, win Promotion twice, play at Wembley twice and, with a goal at Oxford in a Play Off Semi Final, give most City fans one of their all time favourite moments. On a personal note, it was about more than goals with Adam, it was his work rate, attitude and determination. As a supporter you can forgive many things, but a lack of effort is the one that most wont and you could never accuse Adam of not caring. My foremost memory of Stanno is from a League win over Leeds United in 2010. We were one goal ahead in the game, but Leeds were considerably on top, Adam was playing the lone forward role and he put the United defence under continuous pressure. When the ball came up field, Adam won free kicks, throw ins, corners, anything he could to take the pressure of his team. That work rate and unselfish play ultimately led to us winning the match. Come the end of the game he was suffering badly with cramp purely from the effort he had expended to help his team. Paul Tisdale perfectly surmised in his eulogy when he said “always courageous in the fight, Adam was the engine to our train.” Unselfish, committed, determined, there is not one football supporter who would not have wanted an Adam Stansfield in their team.\n\nAfter being diagnosed with Bowel Cancer in April of 2010, Adam would pass away on August 10th of the same year, aged 31 years old. A heart breaking loss to those at Exeter City Football Club, a devastating loss to his Family.\n\nAfter Adam’s passing the Stansfield family were inundated with donations and people wanting to raise money in his name. Shaun Parkin of the Foundation recalls how the concept of the charity began. “Ads used to help out at Jay’s Football team, Twyford Spartans in Tiverton. There was a young lad who was playing in trainers and Ads told him to wear boots for the next session. The boy explained that his Mum could not afford to buy him new boots so Ads bought him a pair. Wayne, Ads older brother, remembered this and the idea of the Foundation to help Under 16’s who were disadvantaged developed.”\n\nAs a registered charity, the Foundation set out to promote participation and healthy recreation for the benefit of Children up to the age of 18 in Devon, Somerset and Herefordshire. The success that has been achieved has been considerable, Shaun explains “We have worked extensively with all three Community teams in Exeter, Yeovil and Hereford. We have supported a range of activities from Coaching courses, Power Chair Football and Soccer Tots, as well as Downs Syndrome, Deaf and Ability Counts Football. The Foundation also helps individuals from disadvantaged backgrounds with boots, kit, subscriptions and recently goggles for visually impaired footballers. We have also helped schools and teams with strips, equipment and facility hire.”\n\nWhilst heavily committing to aid young people in sport, the Foundation also focuses it’s resources on raising awareness of Bowel Cancer and has worked closely with other charities. “We have worked with the “Know the Score” initiative in partnership with Mr Brightside, The Bobby Moore Foundation and the PFA. During Bowel Cancer Awareness Month (April) all Football League Clubs got involved.”\n\nThe past year has been one of incredible highs for the Foundation and its future. Exeter City supporter’s Tom and Jack Vickery set out with the bold target of raising £3,000 to assist with funding and future ambitions for the charity. With an unmatched dedication and the help of the Football Family around the country, the brothers raised a phenomenal £35,000 in 2019. A game changing moment for all involved. “Tom and Jack have been amazing, these boys are driven! I’m not sure they’re going to stop! We have asked them for ideas for projects, which they are considering. We have supplied over 135 primary schools in the three Counties with Football equipment in 2019. We hope to roll this out to Secondary Schools, starting with Tom and Jack’s school this year.”\n\n2020 sees the Foundation enter its tenth year and Shaun certainly feels it is a reflective moment. “Knowing we have made a difference to 70,000 5-11 year olds with the Primary School Initiative, helping individuals participate in football when everything was against them doing so, working with disabled and special need groups, we have had some wonderful success.”\n\nIn 2018 the unveiling of the new Family Stand at SJP proudly stated Adam’s name above it, Elmore Football Club had led the way with a similar gesture in 2011. Supporters continue to show their admiration for Stanno with an annual match being held between Yeovil Town and Exeter City supporters for the Adam Stansfield Memorial Trophy. At Exeter, the Number 9 shirt remains retired and the memory of Adam is still on prominent display as you enter the Cat and Fiddle Training Ground. As the Foundation continues to honour his legacy, Shaun sees an interesting future ahead. “We only expected the Foundation to last 5 years. We have four main roles all completed by family in their own time. We do it for Ads, we do it for his children and we do because there are still supporters out there who loved and respected him.”\n\nThe Foundation, like all charitable organisations, lives on donations and fundraising. Raising awareness of the charity will always be significant, but equally important, is promoting how the Foundation can help and support young people. Something Shaun explains is not always that easy “We love to help individuals and often they are not aware of the support we can give them. We have emailed over 450 schools in Devon on how we can support some of their pupils – no response. We informed staff and issued leaflets with 135 Primary schools on how we can support their pupils – no response. The Foundation wants to make a difference to young people’s lives through participation in healthy recreation.”\n\nThe future of the Foundation looks strong, the Vickery’s incredible efforts will allow a difference to be made to the lives of many youngsters with a love for sport. However, there is a caution to that optimism. “When visiting Yeovil Town FC in April 2019 I discovered that staff in their reception didn’t know who Adam Stansfield was. We are aware that we have a “shelf life,” but we don’t know how long that is. We will keep working hard as a family in Adam’s name. Until then, we continue to make a difference to those we can help and continue to support fundraisers who want to help us.”\n\nSo it rests with us. The Adam Stansfield Foundation exists to remember Adam in the most positive of ways. A Foundation that gives to those who need assistance, to honour the legacy of the type of man who would choose to buy a boy football boots simply because his family could not afford to buy him his own. Keep supporting the Foundation and its many activities, help them to keep helping others, and do so in the name of a player who gave many happy memories to those who watched him play.\n\nhttp://www.adamstansfieldfoundation.com\n\nNICK HAWKER, CHAIR OF THE SUPPORTER’S TRUST\n\nThe year is 2003. The Club Secretary leaves St James Park with a carrier bag full of pound coins, she has just been paid thanks to the emptying of the fruit machines in the Centre Spot. Earlier in the season, then manager, Neil McNab has gone to introduce his Assistant to the playing squad but forgotten his name. A £9,000 bill for a train used by Michael Jackson lay in the tray marked “UNPAID,” it is a very full tray.\n\nOn the 3rd of May 2003 Exeter City Football Club would be relegated out of the football league with debts totalling nearly 5 million pounds. Rock bottom had been hit. However, that summer, as Dr David Treherne emerged from Ivor Doble’s Jewellery shop in Sidwell Street, a glimmer of hope appeared. Exeter City were now owned by the Supporters’ Trust.\n\nThe gradual progress made by the club in the last seventeen years has been well documented, we are a true rags to, slightly more expensive, rags success story. “We Own Our Football Club” is an expression we take great pride in stating, while others battle for their identity and exsistence, at Exeter City, we are safe in our own skin. The vast majority of Grecian fans will know of our Trust ownership, most will argue the positives of it, but as to how our ownership model works in practice? Perhaps the picture is not so clear. This week I met with Trust Chairman Nick Hawker to get an insight into how the club functions in its own unique way.\n\nNick is in his third year as Chair of the Trust, occupying the role of Trust Secretary for four years previous to that. There are many Supporter Trusts around the country but the significance of what we have at Exeter City appears to be the representation at Board Level. During his involvement with the Supporters’ Trust, Nick acknowledges that this fairly recent change has been a big step forward. “The Club Board consists of eight voting Directors, four of whom are proposed by the club for their expertise, and the remaining four appointed from the Trust Board. Previously, only the Trust Chair sat on the Club Board. Every decision is debated and determined by all eight directors, so the Trustees, acting as Directors of the club, are involved in every decision made. Not very much of any significance can occur without the Trust knowing or agreeing to it.”\n\nAs majority shareholders of the Club, you may expect the Chairman of the Trust to be more prevalent. However, the ownership model of the club provides more fluidity to the roles that both Chairmen undertake. “Julian is the Club Chairman, he is the face of the club. He is also the Executive Director of Football and in addition is responsible for our many excellent strategic partnerships that we have. My role is more about ensuring the ethos of the club and supporter ownership is considered and adhered to strategically, but also in the day to day functioning of the club.”\n\nMajority Shareholders at football clubs are generally renowned for one thing, cash. Newcastle fans will tell you Mike Ashley doesn’t put enough money in, Manchester United fans will tell you the Glazers take too much money out. Whilst the owners of Exeter City provide a different service to the club, the question remains a valid one. So how much does the Trust contribute? “The Trust donate £100,000 a year to the Club. On top of this there are various sponsorship arrangements that we have, either with the Club or with the Club’s Charitable partner at the City Community Trust. We want the Club to be self sufficient. In reality though, and compared to other Clubs, what we contribute is miniscule to what a millionaire owner might put in. The difference of course, is that we will not walk away, get bored, or distracted.”\n\nWith respect to the funding contributed, the progress at SJP has not been solely driven by these donations. The Trust has been successful for Exeter City largely due to the ethos on which we run, youth. The Academy at the Club has been prolific. Other Clubs are increasingly confident spending large fees to lure players away from Devon due to the committed and proven way in which the Club educates and improves it’s young footballers. Whilst this ethos has peeked in recent years, that success, largely down to the unjust EPPP system, may start to decrease and lead to tougher times ahead. Nick accepts that this is a worry, but one the club are trying to address. “Player sales form an important part of our business model. Some of this comes directly from the Academy, but we shouldn’t discount our ability to develop non-Academy players. There is also a significant cost saving against player salaries when you promote a youngster into the 1st team, as opposed to signing an experienced player. Matt is doing brilliantly at merging all three types of player together, thus optimising our playing budget. However, more recently we have seen the EPPP system work very much against us. I know Julian is working hard with the EFL to make the process fairer to lower league clubs but this will take time, if it happens at all.”\n\nWhilst the Trust Ownership model has continuously been hailed and, on the whole, been harmonious, in 2016 some fractions did appear. Paul Tisdale’s notice served on his contract led to divides appearing within the club’s support and a situation that, on reflection, could have been dealt with better. Nick recognises that lessons were learnt. “We did learn from it. Club and Trust needed to be talking more coherently and accurately with one another. Likewise the Trust Board and it’s Membership.”\n\nJulian Tagg, by his own omission, made a strong statement at the recent AGM. Simply put, what next? Do we recognise that our ownership model will have highs and lows? Do we seek outside investment of our own regulating? The current playing budget is inflated due to money from player sales, when that is spent, and should no further income from transfers arrive, then what? I asked Nick if our Trust Ownership has a ceiling. “Yes and No. In reality the ceiling is set by the income you can generate and create profit from. So what we generate through the gate, sponsorship and other income sources determine what we should reasonably expect to achieve. What we don’t have is a wealthy benefactor to provide substantial cash input at any given time. However, you might view this as artificially raising the ceiling, there is no guarantee a benefactor would do this repeatedly, nor is there a guarantee of success even if they do.”\n\nThere are currently only three Trust run clubs in the EFL, ourselves, Newport County and AFC Wimbledon. The Dons recently voted on outside investment in an attempt to make up the shortfall for their proposed move to a new stadium, it was voted down. A bond scheme has now been set up where supporters can invest in their club’s future. You have to admire the supporter’s at Wimbledon and their commitment to keeping Trust ownership in place, given their recent history, you can certainly understand why that passion remains. So what to Exeter City’s future? A positive increase in Membership numbers comes with a caution. “Both Adult and Junior Membership has grown. However, along with most other clubs that I’ve spoken to, it’s the retention of Junior Members that is the challenge. The youngsters reach 14-16 and have other distractions and drift away, though they may return later in life! We’d love to change that, so if anyone has any ideas… Encouragingly, there is evidence young people are engaging with our Trust in particular. What we have to do as a Trust, is make the experience a positive and beneficial one, for Trustees, but also members.”\n\nThose who wondered lost around the SJP turf following the final whistle and subsequent relegation in 2003 will need little persuading as to the benefit of the Trust at Exeter City. But what of the younger supporters who have mainly been associated with the Club during the Tisdale-Trust era? Yasmin Western and Jon Beer are positive examples of how a younger generation can impact the Trust and help build for the future. “It was pleasing to see Yas achieve success at the election. One of the core problems of course, is that being on the Trust Board can be very time consuming and people have education and careers to focus on. This is very much on my mind as to how we can help with that.”\n\nExeter City Supporters Trust will be 20 years old this year. We have come a long way from putting padlocks on doors to keep out our, soon to be arrested, owners. Nick is confident that the club’s future is promising. “At present we are reviewing the business in terms of what we could do more efficiently as well as looking at other revenue opportunities. The Trust Finance & Governance Group are leading on this (for the Trust) and the Club Finance Director is leading on behalf of the Club. This review will cut across the entire business, including those areas directly related to football. Alongside this, of course, the pure matter of being successful, with the aim to become a sustainable League One side.”\n\nHow the future of Exeter City Football Club evolves is open to many variables. Those EPPP rules could really do with changing, any player showing promise at SJP can depart aged 16 and we would recieve a mere £12,500. How would the Club look in 2020 if a young Ollie Watkins and Matt Grimes had moved away at 16 for a combined sum of £25,000 and not the £3.5 million we did receive after progressing them through the first team environment? The bar may move again, maybe we will get the chance to develop players such as Ben Chrisene, maybe Ollie Watkins will get a deserved move to the Premier League and a substantial sell on fee will come our way? Difficulties will no doubt rear up in the future. However, taking over a club £5million in debt was difficult. Updating a stadium with little funding to do so was difficult. But the club, as a collective, came through those challenges and found a way. I believe it is positive to question our ownership model, that is how we make progress. Anyone not asking “could we be doing something better” is not fulfilling their role efficiently. After hitting the peak of our last successful curve in 2011, the following years led to difficulties in giving the first team manager a competitive budget and a decline in the health of the Club on and off the field, perhaps there was not enough talk of a “juggernaut coming” prior to that downturn? However, having seen so much horror in the early part of my time supporting this club, I truly believe Trust ownership is right for us. We may be facing a crossroads as to how we progress from the wonderful position we are currently in, but when it comes to continuing the good work already in place at SJP, #thisCITYcan\n\nJOIN THE TRUST #ecfc\n\nYAS WESTERN, NEWLY ELECTED TRUSTEE\n\nWhat do supporters need to do to have a say in how their football club is run? Win the Lottery? Supporters at West Ham, Newcastle and Manchester United are among those contemplating that question currently. At Exeter City anyone can have the opportunity, the act of putting your name forward to run in the Trust election offers the chance to sit on the Trust Board. With this, your voice can be heard as the club builds it’s strategy for the future, it is a unique offer that only very few clubs in the EFL provide. Not only is this opportunity available to strive for, you can also fulfil the role whilst studying for a degree and training at Advanced Level Olympic Weightlifting! Or at least Yasmin Western can. As a newly elected Trustee, I spoke to Yas about how she balances life around her studies, social time and her role at Exeter City.\n\nThe prospect of seeking election may be daunting for many. Football supporters dominant social media and critique from those who may never have met you can be brutal and unfair. You can willingly put forward a suggestion only for @redcardigan8008, with their non existent profile picture, tell you you’re an idiot. Being the face of anything is not easy in 2020. Thankfully, Yas accepted that and relished the challenge. “I felt I had a lot on my shoulders at some points, being the only female running and the youngest running. I did feel, to a certain extent, that I had to represent young women in football properly. I had to come across that I knew what I was talking about, as I did worry that people would use my age and gender to discredit me. I wanted to ensure that I was portraying a clear message throughout the process, to give people a reason to vote for me and keep me accountable.”\n\nThe worst thing any organisation can be is narrow minded, a place for a certain type of person, with a certain type of idea, to then facilitate the addition of other like minded people. It happens in all walks of life, a lack of diversity in the way ideas are cultivated leads to a lack of growth in business. At Exeter City that is not the case, the idea of having a young female Trustee was welcomed. “There were so many people that spurred me on, it wasn’t very difficult to find people to nominate me and I was overwhelmed with the votes I received. I ran because I knew I had something that could benefit the Trust and the Club. I really wanted to make sure I could learn the ins and outs of the club, so when times get tough in the future, there are people of the next generation who know how to help.”\n\nNick Hawker stated last week of the importance of the next generation of Grecian supporter having their voice heard. If the younger supporters we have now do not embrace our Trust ownership model then it could ultimately lead to a diminishment of the Trust’s role and the uncertainty that all that could bring. The role Trustees such as Yasmin and Jon Beer can play in the exposure of Trust activities will be important. “Ultimately, the current custodians of the club will not be around forever. It is the youth’s role to learn from those who founded the Trust and saved the club. Equally, football is for all ages, if we want to brand ourselves as a family club then we need to cater for supporters of all ages. It is also important to have young people represented to inspire others to do the same. I was definitely inspired by Jon Beer the year before me, I hope I have done the same for other young people.”\n\nTalking of wanting a younger element within the Trust is one thing. Giving the winning nominees the opportunity to explore their own ideas and creative processes is another. The Trust is not the committee meeting from the Vicar of Dibley, where you have a chat, a custard cream and go home. Despite only winning a place on the Trust Board at the end of 2019, Yas has been quickly getting to work. “It has taken me a little while to find my feet and get updated on all of the information that I need to know. Now I’ve picked up what I need to, I’m starting to put my ideas out there, especially in regard to the Trust 20th Anniversary preparations. Equally, I’ve been asked to work on things that I usually would not choose to do, such as the Finance and Governance Group. It has been really interesting and a good skill to acquire. The biggest lesson I have learnt so far is that everyone on the Trust has different strengths and we can compliment each other really well.”\n\nFulfilling the role of a Trustee is a huge commitment. I would be confident in assuming Yas did not receive encouragement to stand for election solely due to her cheery disposition on away days, her passion to be successful is evident and the desire to make the Football Club better is the driving force to that. Balancing her many responsibilities is not always easy though. “I enjoy being busy. During exams it was definitely busy, going from a two hour Law exam to dial into a Trust Board was quite a lot in one day! I wouldn’t have it any other way though! Nick and the other Trustees have been amazing at checking in with me and I know there is help if I need it. We really are a team as opposed to twelve individuals.”\n\nI am a neutral watcher of the Premier League. I have my favourites, but generally am not overly fussed who does what. This year has been a hard watch, a lack of competition coupled with the introduction of VAR has turned many away from the TV screen and onto the terraces. There has been a “Support your Local” movement growing throughout football. The joy of travelling the country, meeting new people, spending time with friends and watching football, whatever the result, appears to becoming more embraced with younger supporters. At Exeter City, you not only can support your local, you can help run it! Quite the opportunity and one Yas is keen to maximise. “I would definitely encourage anyone to get involved. Everyone’s opinion is valid and should be heard, not just young people. It is important we get a wide variety of skills and assets on the Trust board, things like technological know how and social media knowledge are strengths that most young people have and can be used. Being a Trustee is a lot of work! There are less intense ways to get involved. You can join a working group and that allows you to do things you are interested in that benefit the Trust. There are working groups in four different areas and I would definitely encourage young people who don’t think they can fulfil the role of a Trustee to attend those working groups.”\n\nExeter City offers the chance to have your voice heard, it seems a simple gesture, but at so many football clubs that is not the case. I am sure Yas did not necessarily see herself as a future Trustee a few years ago, but a love and dedication to improve the football club she supports has lead down this path. This is no synthetic gesture. Yas is required to contribute and enhance the Trust and Club with her responsibilities as a Trustee, something she is clearly already achieving. There are many things we could do to assist the Club, not all are possible. Time, budget restraints, work, family… there are often many barriers that prevent us from perhaps offering more than we currently do or would like to. However, at Exeter City, the one barrier there is not, is age.\n\nDANIEL NARDIELLO\n\nWe have all got our favourite moments supporting this glorious football club. Stacey against Carlisle? Logan at Plainmoor? Great occasions, but one night I will never forget, for the good, the bad and the ugly, was 9th November 2010. A trophy that has since become the subject of much contention meant everything that night as the Devon Derby returned after an eleven year absence. Ninety minutes on the clock, balls breaks in midfield, Sercombe to Logan, Logan to Nardiello… bedlam. What a night. This week I got the opportunity to speak to Daniel Nardiello about his time at the better, redder half of Devon.\n\nDaniel signed for City in July 2010. After spending most of the previous two season’s out on loan from his parent club Blackpool, and suffering with injuries, Paul Tisdale offered the chance to move to Devon. “I had moved around a bit throughout my career and Exeter was another move. I had been injured for two years so I was thankful a few clubs still wanted me, when meeting with Tis I was more than happy to move down south. Paul’s an honest bloke. He talked about football in what I believe is the right way, that was confirmed when I started working with him. He’s not got a bad dress sense either.”\n\nIt was to prove a tough start to his Grecian’s career, just a few weeks into the new season the club was rocked by the death of Adam Stansfield. As we mourned the loss of our former No.9, it would be Daniel who scored the opening goal in an emotional occasion against Bristol Rovers at SJP weeks later. “I obviously didn’t know Adam that well but it was a difficult time. I know how much the players, staff and fans loved him. He will never be forgotten in Exeter and it is nice to see his son doing so well.”\n\nDespite being based in the north for most of his career, the move south didn’t faze Daniel. As he settled in at SJP he briefly lived with David Noble. “I lived with Nobes when we were teenagers at Lilleshall so I knew what he was like – he’s a great character and I had fun living with him. Don’t know if I could have done it full time though!”\n\nThat November evening at Home Park would be the moment the name Nardiello would forever be remembered in Exeter City folklore, a bitter sweet evening that hadn’t started how he wanted. “I was fuming on the sidelines that I hadn’t been brought on and then I got the call with five minutes left – I think it was because I was a decent penalty taker. I made those few minutes count though and it was probably my most enjoyable goal, simply for the timing of it and how much it meant to the fans and club.”\n\nIt was proving to be a dramatic season at SJP and only two weeks later Daniel and City were at it again. Three goals down at Oldham before half time, Richard Logan pulled one back on 77 minutes, Jamie Cureton scored on 85 minutes, Ryan Harley missed a penalty on 88 minutes and then a Nardiello goal moments later rescued a point. “Again, I was not happy being on the bench! I came on at half time and was playing left wing against a young seventeen year old. Me and Noble both came on and made a real impact in the game, it was a great comeback.”\n\nThe 2010-11 season ended with a home win over Plymouth Argyle and the most extraordinary visit to Hillsborough, Daniel levelled the game at 1-1 before Archibald-Henville clinched a memorable winner. “The highlight was Troy’s goal but Tis coming on was a massive surprise, I dont think Megson was too happy! We played Sheffield Wednesday off the pitch that day.”\n\nThirteen goals in Thirty Seven appearances represented a good first season with plenty of big moments and Daniel had settled well under the management of Paul Tisdale. “He’s one of the best. I had some awful managers who were terrible people but Tis was the complete opposite. Although I didn’t agree with everything he said he was always honest and straight with his players. Easily in my top two I have played for.”\n\nIt was a frustrating summer at SJP, with more ins than outs and key players departing. “It really cost us. It was a shame and tough to take as player, but that’s the nature of the game unfortunately.”\n\nSeason Two in red and white was sadly less successful, a relegation battle followed from the excitement of the previous year. However, a strong Liverpool team visiting SJP in the League Cup did provide a memorable moment. “We couldn’t believe the line up when we saw it. It was nice to score against Reina, especially when he was such a brilliant penalty saver. Something I can tell the Grandkids.”\n\nA red card at Charlton for arguing with the linesman over the loss of sight in both his eyes earned a suspension, but on his return Daniel hit his best form. Eight goals in six games included the opener in a thriller at Sheffield United. “I was in a rich reign of form at the time. My wife and her parents were late and my father in law told my wife not to worry because I never score early goals, I scored after about five minutes I think. It would have been a great game for the neutral to watch and we deserved at least a point out of it.”\n\nUltimately the season ended in relegation and after a good spell in Devon the opportunity to join Rotherham United and challenge for promotion was a chance not to be missed. Daniel still has fond memories of his time at SJP despite the disappointing end to his time here. “It was a lovely place and the fans were fantastic. The club was very different to others I have been to and the community spirit and family side of it is something I feel is very important. I have found memories of Exeter and always look out to see how they have done. It was also a lot warmer and dryer than Manchester!”\n\nJULIAN TAGG\n\nIn 2002 Julian Tagg was working alongside Eamonn Dolan in the attempt to develop and regenerate an Academy that had dwindled away to nothing. As someone who had began coaching the club’s under twelve’s, Julian had progressed that team through their perspective age groups and, at the time, his involvement in all things Exeter City, alongside his role with the Trust, started and ended with that responsibility. Then, sadly for pretty much everyone involved, John Russell and Mike Lewis arrived. The duo set out their intention to close the Academy. It would be Julian’s desire to fight this that would begin a behind the scenes journey that has ultimately lead to him becoming Chairman of the club he had grown up watching. It has certainly been an interesting ride, this week I spoke with Julian about his current focus and what the future holds.\n\nThe 1st of June 2018 was to be a pivotal date in the history of Exeter City Football Club. The confirmed departure of Paul Tisdale, alongside the anticipated departure of Steve Perryman, saw the end of an era at SJP. Tisdale, Perryman and Julian Tagg had been a cohesive and ever-present off field team, a trio that had experienced all number of highs and lows together. Whilst, I am sure, they may not have always agreed, their combined passion for the Club had seen a negotiation of tough times and a undeniable desire to be successful. On a personal level, the loss of two close associates must have been tough, but on a professional level it has led to a slight change in role for the current City Chairman, as he has filled many of the gaps left by Perryman’s departure. A change Julian has enjoyed. “I am most happy looking after and working with our Academy programme. The challenge of working with different managers, understanding what makes them tick, knowing when to get involved, but more importantly when not to, is a big challenge. On occasions it has been very uncomfortable and really difficult, but most of the time it is a privilege.”\n\nMany will not have seen Paul Tisdale’s departure as a surprise. However, the appointment of Matt Taylor was swift. Were the contingencies for Paul’s departure already in place? “I think about successive planning most of the, if not every, day. Even about the replacement for myself. Matt and many others had been considered and, whilst I am hoping Matt will stay for many years, the thinking behind what comes next started the same day Matt did.”\n\nWith the on field emphasis at Exeter City focussing on succession through the Academy, Taylor’s appointment, and the subsequent progression of Dan Green, may suggest a similar ethos in the coaching set up. “We are always looking to innovate in any possible way to gain an advantage. We have recently restructured parts of the way we organise as a group and how the coaches deliver. What it takes to be exceptional is constantly tested, quantified and reshaped. Alongside this there is a strategic plan that will be the base that takes us through at least three more years.”\n\nThat progression within the coaching set up may have been a subject for more discussion after Matt Taylor was approached earlier in the season. Thankfully, he chose to stay and build at SJP. For a man with no managerial experience, Taylor has certainly started his career impressively. “Matt is becoming an extremely good manager. I’m reluctant to say what I really think as I am fearful that other clubs higher up the food chain may become even keener. For someone with little managerial experience he shows considerable maturity in how he handles the many aspects of the business he is responsible for. ”\n\nIn 2008 Exeter City achieved promotion from Non league football, in 2009 a second successive promotion was achieved. Players departed for high fees, crowds were good and the club was truly at its peak. Fast forward to 2014 and, following relegation from League One, the club had a summer transfer embargo and were reliant on a PFA loan. Whilst Exeter City are currently prosperous, when Julian raised the question of the club’s future at the AGM for successive years, it is important we all pay attention. After all, he has seen it all before. “Only time can answer the question of “have we prepared enough for our future?” All I can say, probably too often, is that “it’s not the survival of the fittest, it’s the survival of the adaptable.” I am told I am always in too much of a hurry, but my motivation is that I worry about our future.”\n\nOne contributor to the Club’s immediate future could be a perspective transfer of Ollie Watkins. The City youth star was awarded the EFL London Player of the Year Award this past week and his form in the Championship for Brentford has been exceptional. “Any transfer is always hugely significant for us. In the past, we have always tried to work on the premise of “thirds.” That generally allows us to allocate a third to the managers budget, a third to the Academy, which often goes into facilities, and finally a third for the club for a plethora of central projects and demands.”\n\nPaul Tisdale regularly used the phrase “we are what we are.” As is representative of our former manager, this tended to split supporters, with some nodding in agreement and others annoyed by its lack of ambition. The limitations to a club in a City such as Exeter may well have been reassessed with the heights the Chiefs have reached. Has the success at Sandy Park opened the eyes of those who feel Exeter City has certain boundaries? “I would like to think so. Having played in a couple of Cup Finals in the mud and mire that was the County Ground, and watched what used to be the big games barely attract a thousand people, to go there now and see a twelve thousand sell out must say something about what can be achieved in our burgeoning City.”\n\nThe Club’s model for assisting income has largely relied on producing good young players, developing them through the first team environment and selling for a high profit. Such has been the success that these players are now being poached younger, are we the victims of our own success? “Very much so. Our success with individual players, as well as how well our youngsters have performed in the Leasing.Com and Under 23 games, has attracted what sometimes feels like a Jamboree of Scouts to our games.”\n\nThe main point of contention over how we monetise our successful ability to develop players has been the controversial EPPP ruling. Is there regret amongst EFL clubs over the agreement to the deal? “Many clubs were between a rock and a hard place. Our own financial position back then was pretty dire, but on reflection, and in hindsight, they should. It must be said that the grant money that comes from the Premier League has been hugely significant in helping us develop players and achieve our current secure financial footing. However, its inception was some years ago now. The games finance, player values and wage demands have significantly changed during that period. It is now reasonable to expect to lobby for changes, some of the arbitration fees are now too far below real value and need to be reassessed. I am spending much of my time trying to influence the FA, the EFL, the Premier League and the government to achieve that.”\n\nFrom coaching, Russell, Lewis, CVA’s, administration, relegation, promotion, play off finals, trips to Brazil and ground development there is not much Julian Tagg has not seen as his involvement at SJP has increased. “Sometimes when I look forward and get despondent and worry about what needs to be done, I get solace and satisfaction out of looking back and seeing how far we have come. Under Trust ownership it has been an amazing journey and one that so many have played a significant part in.”\n\nJulian will one day step aside from the Club and perhaps then will be the time to fully appreciate his contribution. However, his significant part in helping Exeter City rise from the ashes that was the Russell, Lewis, Geller circus, should not be understated. Without the desire to seek public attention or glorification, Julian Tagg has been the focal point as the club has made giant strides in its infrastructure in the past decade and dedicated itself, even when the funds barely permitted it, to having a successful, progressive Academy. Many off field heroes of the Club’s past have come and gone but Julian has remained a constant, that type of consistency in leadership is undeniably important and it’s reliability helps others fulfil their roles with more ease. Whoever eventually replaces our current Chairman will certainly have big shoes to fill."
