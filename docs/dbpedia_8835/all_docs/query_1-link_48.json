        "text": "Projects\n\nExeter City Football club, new bar and changing rooms\n\nArque has been involved in a number of projects at St James Park over the last few years, including a new bar and the brand new Heritage Lounge, which was developed from executive boxes to make a bright open space for commercial activities at the club. We have also built new toilets and changing rooms which have improved conditions for both the Exeter City team and visiting teams and officials.\n\nArque also assisted in overseeing the construction of the new Stagecoach Adam Stansfield Stand, completed in 2018. These works demonstrate Arque's Flexibility for running both small and large works for its dedicated clients. Overseeing the erection of the new stand would not have been possible without our highly experienced and capable staff being able to manage multiple subcontractors while also cooperating with the Client, and the Principle contractor G + L Events to give them a stand that matched their vision.\n\nThe high profile nature of this project meant that no corners could be cut and that everything had to be up to the highest standards of safety and quality. Luckily for Arque, this is our usual operating procedure, and we were able to uphold these standards with minimal difficulty while keeping to schedule at all times."
