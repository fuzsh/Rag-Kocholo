It certainly would be a much better image for the club to have the cameras pointing in the opposite direction, but maybe it could work in our favour also. Away players and fans may be surprised by the atmosphere and crowd that we can generate on big match days these days, having only seen pictures on TV prior to that. I think out of the many factors players consider when moving to a new League One club, how the stadium appears on TV would be low down the list. We don't go after the top players, so their choices are already limited anyway. They will be much more concerned with location, salary and playing prospects. If any of our own fans are embarrassed by the view on TV, they should have a look around at some of the other stadiums in the division. They may have all four sides filled by seats, but a great deal of them are not as pretty as ours."
