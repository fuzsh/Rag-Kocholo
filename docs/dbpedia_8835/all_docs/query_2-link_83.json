        "text": "Marco Silva has played down speculation linking Jay Stansfield with a transfer away from Fulham in a blow to Birmingham City and the striker's other suitors.\n\nBlues have registered an interest in re-signing Stansfield, who scored 13 goals for the club on loan last term, despite their relegation to League One. New Blues boss Chris Davies has transformed his squad with 11 new arrivals and Stansfield would be the icing on the cake this transfer window.\n\nBut Fulham manager Silva has other ideas. When asked about Stansfield's situation earlier this week, the Portuguese said: \"Everything that we planned for Jay in the last two seasons - and this is going to be the third - happened. Last season in the Championship he was one of the best players at Birmingham and scored the goals we expected him to score. There has been a lot of approaches from Championship clubs but I have decided he is going to be part of our squad.\n\n\"In Portugal he didn't play because he had a small issue in one training session and we had to protect him. Last Saturday he played two friendlies, one in the afternoon against Hoffenheim and he played in the morning too. I can say to you he scored as well. He is going to be a player for Fulham football club. There is nothing more to say. We can keep receiving approaches, OK, but our idea is to keep him in our squad.\"\n\nREAD: Dion Sanderson makes costly mistake as Nathan Jones applies Birmingham City pressure\n\nREAD: Chris Davies gives Willum Willumsson injury update before trip to Wycombe\n\nWith that in mind, here is a rundown of everything that has happened in the Stansfield saga to date...\n\nWhat Stansfield has said\n\nAt the club's end of season awards dinner, Stansfield confirmed how much he'd enjoyed himself in a Blues shirt despite relegation, and he also predicted that the club would return to its rightful place quickly, setting aside the disappointment of the drop so early into Knighthead's highly ambitious project.\n\n“Going up there and knowing my teammates have voted for me, and the supporters, I just felt sad to be leaving,” Stansfield said. “It’s one of those things, I signed up for a season’s loan and I’ve loved every minute and learnt a lot. I think I’ve just built up such a relationship with the fans and the club that I wanted to give my all in every game. The goal early on helped. I earned my respect on the first day and could show everyone why I chose Birmingham.\n\n\"We came up short in the end and everyone around the club is feeling hurt. I think the club will be back where it belongs very soon. Hopefully next season they can push on. Being around the city and seeing the fans, and seeing how welcoming and hard-working everybody is, there are amazing people everywhere round here.\"\n\nRead in full what the striker said of his future\n\nWhat Blues have said\n\nDavies addressed the Stansfield situation recently and didn't shy away from the fact Blues are interested in the forward. He said: \"He’s a player that won all the awards last year, and when I analysed the team before I came in he was the stand-out player.\n\n\"He’s gone back to a really good Premier League club that obviously value him highly and they have their own plans and their own ambitions. If he became available and we could do it, it would be something that would be really exciting for everyone. But everyone knows it will be a challenge to do that.”\n\nThe domino effect\n\nFulham's stance could soften if they need some cash to sign a target of their own. Stansfield is clearly a saleable asset and they have a willing buyer at the other end of the phone in Blues.\n\nAll Premier League clubs are treading a fine line with Profit and Sustainability Regulations (PSR) and Fulham could need to make some cash at some stage. The Cottagers are expected to complete the transfer of Emile Smith Rowe from Arsenal in the near future, in a deal which could be worth up to £34m, while reports emerged on Thursday that they have also bid £20m for Manchester United midfielder Scott McTominay.\n\nBlues are ready to act if Fulham decide they want to sell Stansfield. Equally, they are also looking at other targets in the meantime.\n\nThe price tag\n\nBlues would have to break the League One transfer record to sign Stansfield, who is valued in excess of £5million. The biggest fee paid for a player by a League One club is currently the £4m Sunderland spent to sign Will Grigg from Wigan in January 2019.\n\nStansfield's contract at Craven Cottage runs until 2027 so they hold all the cards. Fulham surely wouldn't entertain loaning Stansfield to a League One club, with a number of Championship sides showing interest in temporary moves. Cardiff City and Hull City are among the second tier clubs keen on Stansfield but that list is likely to be longer after Blues beat half the Championship to his signature last year."
