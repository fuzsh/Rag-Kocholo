        "text": "I have walked out of HP early once in my life. It was maybe 2013/14 when we played them up the road in what I think what is now the EFL Trophy. So-called Argyle ‘fans’ chanted ‘Adam Stansfield - he’s better off dead’. By my reckoning, Jay would’ve been 12 or 13.\n\nNo wonder the lad hates us.\n\nStansfield has been caught in a sad and unfortunate situation. The chants you mention are terrible but it has to be said that this whole crap show was started by Exeter fans mocking the death of Alan Nicholls in a motor cycle crash-they didn't cover themselves in glory by some of the things chanted about Bradley Wright Phillips mother either, although that spectacularly backfired on them. Start these things and retaliation will follow, same as in the Manchester United/Liverpool exchanges about Munich and Hillsborough-not excusing it, it's totally pathetic that football should invoke such vitriol but that's the way of it sadly.\n\nThe old saying is “you do your talking on the pitch”.\n\nI don’t know if he was getting any gip from the fans in the away game, but after he scored (a great goal) he certainly made a point of riling the away end.\n\nAnd the T-shirt at HP was so immature. If players can get fined for showing a T-shirt with a brand logo then something clearly intended to antagonise the crowd should have got him a one-game ban. The lad needs to grow up - hopefully still on loan in the lower leagues.\n\nIf someone had taunted me over my Dad's death I'd never forgive or forget it......I don't blame the lad at all for goading Argyle fans, I'd do exactly the same\n\nWe are talking a tiny minority of total idiots which every club have. Hardly fair to tar Argyle fans with that brush.\n\nFootball's a funny old game. Once we get our new manager in, imagine if we tried to sign him on a season long loan.\n\nNo doubting his quality. I wonder if he would take up such an offer?\n\nThink I know the answer to that!\n\nWe are talking a tiny minority of total idiots which every club have. Hardly fair to tar Argyle fans with that brush.\n\nWhere did I say all Argyle fans ? You're right it is a brainless minority of morons but he ain't gonna forget it & I don't blame him.\n\nHas everyone else forgotten the Devonport end display in honour of his Father ? I'm also sure more than a few pence made its way North to support the charity set up in his memory.\n\nCastigate our brain dead morons by all means, but we shouldn't let the minority cloud the memory of the majority positive responses that were sent his and their clubs way from our neck of the woods. They're obsessed with us enough, only ever wish us ill while ignoring the good from us and the equally bad from them. He'd do well to consider that as well.\n\nPotentially a very good player but his career needs to stop being based on loans. He might have more reason than most to have a genuine dislike of our club (although it's literally a minority of idiots), life is rubbish at times but our hardships are never an excuse to behave like an idiot.\n\nI’d have him playing in a green shirt in a heartbeat- quality player.\n\nAs a player I agree, but I can’t see that happening on any level given the back story around his dad / argyle etc. he’s made his point aroujd “once a read always a red” and it would never happen\n\nWe are talking a tiny minority of total idiots which every club have. Hardly fair to tar Argyle fans with that brush.\n\nOh and I agree but he won’t see it that way would be? To him, that’s what we will represent / think. I’d wager if I was him you’d struggle to make the distinction.\n\nAbsolutely correct that those songs represent only a tiny section of the fan base"
