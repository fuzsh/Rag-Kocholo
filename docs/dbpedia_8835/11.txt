A heart-breaking but beautiful story has emerged from League One today, when Jay Stansfield scored two goals in Exeter City's 2-0 win over Barnsley.

They were the 19-year-old's first league goals, as he wore his late father's no. 9 jersey. His dad, Adam Stansfield, was an Exeter City stalwart from 2006 until his death from cancer in 2010. His jersey was retired until this season, when his son joined on loan to the club from Fulham.

Stansfield already has Premier League caps to his name, and his dad will undoubtedly be looking down on him with a proud smile on his face, after getting off the mark in the English league.

Jay Stansfield also told a lovely story to The Guardian recently, about finding his dad's old boots.

"When it was lockdown I was out in the garden playing with my brothers and I found a pair of boots under the bed. They were old [Nike] Tiempo 90s. I asked Mum: ‘Can I wear them?’ I went out in the garden and wore them and in my head I was going to wear them in the next game.

"I thought it would be a nice touch but they didn’t last, the bottom fell off. I’ve got a lot of his boots in glass boxes. It is nice to have things around. Mum gave me his watch to wear to prom when I finished school. I like looking at photos but obviously it makes me upset, and I don’t always want to be upset.

There are positives in life that I can take from it. I try to be as strong as possible and look like I’m OK when sometimes I’m not.”
