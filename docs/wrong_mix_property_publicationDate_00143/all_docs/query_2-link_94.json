        "text": "May’s Short Story of the Month is ‘The Visit’ by Jaki McCarrick, an award-winning writer of plays, poetry and fiction.\n\nMcCarrick won the 2010 Papatango New Writing Prize for her play, Leopoldville, and her play Belfast Girls, developed at the National Theatre London, was shortlisted for the Susan Smith Blackburn Prize and the 2014 BBC Tony Doyle Award. The Scattering, from which ‘The Visit’ is taken, was shortlisted for the Edge Hill Prize.\n\n‘The Visit’ takes place against the backdrop of Bill Clinton’s visit to the border town of Dundalk in Ireland – a visit that was very much a part of the Peace Process.\n\nThe Visit\n\nThis is an extract. Read the full short story for free on the Seren website.\n\nIt had been a day of weather: snow and wind, sunshine and rain.\n\nWater dripped from the overhanging hedges in the drive and\n\nthe path was thick with pine needles. Brendan made a mental\n\nnote to sweep them up once Pat had gone. He stopped before\n\nthe gates and pulled his trousers up by their creases to check\n\nhis shoes and thought that maybe he should’ve worn his boots.\n\nHe walked on. Pat would make him forget. Pat could make you\n\nforget all kinds of silly woes. He glanced over at Coogan’s and\n\nnoticed the stars and stripes flag, still and wet on the pole.\n\nAfter McCaughey’s he looked over at Joy Callan’s neat line of\n\nlaundry crowning her raised side lawn: a small satin-rimmed\n\nblanket, black stockings, two blue ballroom gowns, a pair of\n\norange nylon pillowcases. As he approached her house he saw\n\nher in the yard, bright and chic in pink slacks and a tight white\n\njumper. She was raking up leaves. He watched her part the\n\ndresses then yank the wet leaves into a pile. It made him smile;\n\nshe might have hung the gowns out after she’d raked, but Joy\n\nalways seemed to do things differently from others. And anyway,\n\nhe was glad, because she made the task so mesmerising. He\n\nrecalled how after her husband had gone she had kept body and\n\nsoul together by moonlighting, rather originally he thought, as\n\na mushroom picker in Clones. Otherwise, as a relief teacher\n\nshe had taught both his children in the Friary, though she had\n\nnot been popular. He waved and wondered would she be at\n\nthe Square tomorrow. He made a mental note to call in one\n\nof these evenings with the picture of Sean’s wedding in the\n\npaper.\n\nWalking on, his thoughts returned to Pat. He looked forward\n\nto seeing him. There would be much talk of the ‘great\n\nadventures’ as Brendan called them, the London times, the days\n\nof the Black Lion where he had been manager for nearly a\n\ndecade and where Pat had been its most notorious barfly. He\n\nwas proud to think he’d organised some of London’s most\n\ncelebrated lock-ins, booked musicians from Dublin and Doolin\n\nand Donegal, and had the likes of David Bailey and Donovan\n\nin attendance. Soon he and Pat would be reminiscing about\n\nthose times, about the dog races at Hackney and White City,\n\nthe times they’d played poker in Holland Park with Jack Doyle.\n\nHe walked up the cobbled lane towards the station. He could\n\nsee clearly on the cold day the sprawl of the town towards the\n\nhills. The trees by the church were draped in ropes of white\n\nlights, and a flurry of flags hung from Carroll’s Apartments. He\n\nwas amazed to think that here, in this small dot on the face of\n\nthe globe, he and Pat would stand together tomorrow evening\n\nand see the President of America.\n\nThe big station clock said ten to three. He had a few minutes\n\nyet to gather his thoughts, stare over at the glass wall of the\n\nbrewery. He sat outside on the iron seat. The gulls hovered\n\nabove him, filling the air with their cries. The sweet wort’s more\n\npungent today, he thought, as his gaze fixed on the huge copper\n\nkettle glistening through the glass. It had been his first job in\n\nthe brewery to wash the kettle out once the sweet wort had been\n\nsiphoned off. He would then prepare it for the following\n\nmorning’s shipment of hops and grain. He had spent the best\n\npart of five years inside that copper drum, up to his ankles in\n\nthe remnants of fresh hops, proteins and sticky clumps of\n\ncaramelised sugar. It had given him time to think; to put into\n\nperspective all that had happened in ’74.\n\nThere was a rumble on the tracks. He turned and saw the\n\nsleek green body of the Enterprise stack up like a metallic snake\n\nalong platform two. He walked over and watched from the\n\nticket office. The doors of the carriages swung open. Women\n\nwith pull-up trolleys, young men in dishevelled suits, Mrs Little\n\nand her daughter, Edel. As the crowds dispersed he saw a ghost,\n\nthe tall, hulking frame of Pat Coleman standing stock-still on\n\nthe busy platform. The springy hair was all white, the once firm\n\nchest now visibly lax. Brendan watched his friend remove a\n\ncigarette from behind his ear, ask a girl for a light, then take\n\nthree or four concentrated puffs before flicking the stub behind\n\nhim onto the tracks. Pat’s short-sleeved shirt seemed frowsy\n\nand unironed; the thick brown arms with their blue tattoos\n\nrecalled to Brendan Pat’s nickname on the sites: Popeye. Popeye\n\nPat had had the strength of ten men, and once, in a drunken\n\nrage, Brendan had seen him flatten as many.\n\nHe followed Pat’s gaze. Up to the pale, elusive sky of the\n\nNorth; out to the striking sweep of the white-capped hills, the\n\ngreen spire of the Protestant church peeping up against them.\n\nHe began to feel unfamiliar pangs of pride for the town, as if\n\nthrough Pat’s languorous impression, he, too, was glimpsing\n\nit for the first time. The town was his wife’s town, and he had\n\nalways found it hard to appreciate its people with their\n\nwariness, their industrious, practical approach to things. His\n\nwife had been right; he had put up a resistance. She had\n\naccused him often of hiding away in the brewery kettle like a\n\ngenie. But the friendships he had formed here had been\n\nwithout the closeness of his London bonds. The men he knew\n\nfrom the town were nothing like that famous man on platform\n\ntwo.\n\n…"
