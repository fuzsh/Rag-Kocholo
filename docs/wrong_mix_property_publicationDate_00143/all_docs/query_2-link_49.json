        "text": "Citation preview\n\nForeword Toby Litt\n\nRecently, I caught the wrong bus (a number 21) from Norwich City Centre to the University of East Anglia – where the first International conference on the work of J. G. Ballard, ‘From Shanghai to Shepperton’ took place, in May 2007. Instead of heading to the campus directly, up the beautifully named Unthank Road, the bus went via Bowthorpe – it also went via Ballard. Our slow, winding, doubling-back route took in Norwich Research Park and the recently built Norfolk and Norwich University Hospital. A bright low sun reflected off the artificial lakes, at least I assumed they were artificial. Most of the houses we saw, as we crawled along, were on the peripheries of housing estates – facades of pale pink brick and thickly double-glazed windows, lawns which give nothing away and decals on the bedroom windows of suicidal teens. A pregnant woman with a bindi got on; a research scientist I had taken for a student got off. Eventually, the bus arrived at the UEA campus, famous for its unapologetically concrete architecture, especially the stack-box ziggurats in which first-year students are accommodated. We had arrived, also, at Ballard. Sometimes, when I think about J. G. Ballard the man, I find it hard not to suspect that – somehow or other – he gained access to Google Earth over 40 years ago. His fictional project seems to have been based on a cold assessment of what (apart from woods and fields) takes up most of our country’s surface area, what is most obtrusive when viewed from space. Hence, carparks and motorways, airports and their runways, high rise buildings, suburban housing estates, psychiatric hospitals, shopping centres. No other novelist has paid such close attention to the quiddity of where we now live and work – in all its recalcitrant mundanity. The rest of us, for the most part, pass through these spaces with the thought, ‘What could possibly happen in this emptiness?’ The Ballard bluff, or double bluff, has always been that he actually likes it here, not least because he sees it not as void but as unbounded plenitude. Everything can happen here. At the end of his introduction to Vermilion Sands (1971), he mischievously writes of his guess-at-thefuture, ‘I wait optimistically for it to take concrete shape around me.’ This way, or so he insists, is his; the technological, the surface-loving, rather than all the possible others: atavistic, cthonic, nostalgic, theistic.\n\nviii\n\nFOREWORD\n\nWhat we lack in the United Kingdom is any glamour of our present selves. (America, by contrast, suffers from the opposite problem: glamour-dazzle.) But, as an outsider-insider, or an insider-outsider, Ballard manages to see what we can’t. He has no interest in our history or, even worse, our heritage. This, in itself, is remarkable. One of the thought-experiments I play with any British writer is to reimagine them as coming from another country. For example, I refigure Graham Greene as a French writer. How much more seriously he would have been taken, as an existential thinker. Then I move to Muriel Spark and sense how the distance-travelled of translation from German to English would bring her metaphysics so much closer. Then I turn to Ballard. A French Ballard, I think, would be a normalized, de-radicalized Ballard. His characters behave, anyway, more like characters in French art movies than in other British novels contemporary to his own (let alone the ooh-er-missus intersex relations of British cinema 1950–1980). But how about a full-on German Ballard? – with autobahns for motorways, with the motorik regularity of his sentences, with Hitler as an unforgettable erotic backdrop. That has an eerie rightness about it. As another thought-experiment, I find it suggestive, following Gilles Deleuze and Félix Guattari’s approach to Kafka, to speak not of Jim Ballard but of the Ballard Writing Machine (sweet echoes of the Burroughs Adding Machine).1 This might take away the taint of Shepperton, but it might also take away the tang of Shepperton. How does the Ballard Writing Machine work? It has a definite prediliction for certain formalities. For example, the form of titles, both book and chapter, is very often Definite Article plus Adjective plus Noun (from The Drowned World (1962) to The Atrocity Exhibition (1970)) although later this becomes Adjective plus Noun (from Concrete Island (1974) to Super-Cannes (2000)). It favours a conservative structure. The novels come with numbered, titled chapters. Even the Machine’s most extreme production, The Atrocity Exhibition, does not deviate from this template. The contents page of a BWM novel, therefore, manages to suggest something both opaque and transparent. No plot developments are given away, but – if we have encountered the Machine’s work before – we already know the parameters of the likely action. There will be a building-up which is, at the same time, a breakingdown. People collectively will become involved in some regularized mania, within the elaboration of which the actions of the main characters will prove decisive but from which they themselves will remain essentially detached. The BWM-men will have affairs with the BWM-women. These will start and end abruptly, without great difficulty or regret. Sex will occur but it will be less focused upon, in the writing, than those moments when the dreamworlds of the lovers coincide most closely. The Machine is more interested in the jerky choreography of meeting and parting\n\nFOREWORD\n\nix\n\nthan the flowing entanglement of hearts. I don’t believe any BWM novel features a couple who meet, marry and remain faithful unto death. The lovers are, in a sense, too easily distracted for that; not immoral, just unfocused. Often, it seems almost as if they never come to full consciousness, they are always half-dreaming one another. But let’s stop the Machine and return Ballard’s humanity to him, if only for the sake of some slightly less inelegant sentences. Despite Ballard’s insistence upon the parapsychological (see V. Vale’s Quotes and Conversations), it seems to me as though he has no interest in the Freudian subconscious as such. His interchangeable heroes – only a couple of short steps away from the active, square-jawed ciphers of 1950s sci-fi – do not have rich mental lives. But as soon as one takes the external world which they inhabit as their subconscious, as soon as one sees sublimation as being replaced by efflorescence, by architecture, then one begins to see Ballard aright. In this reading, there remains no barrier between external and internal worlds. Ballard is a true Surrealist. But his distance from the originals of that movement is made clearer when you realize how useless a tool automatic writing would be to him. Either all his writing is automatic, or none. And, either way, it accesses the same well-springs. While reading Ballard, I don’t generally feel – as I do with other writers – that this or that passage has come from some deeper place within the psyche. Ballard’s explorations are relentlessly horizontal – until, with the internal/external flip, one realizes that they have all along taken the horizontal for the vertical. (Here, he coincides with Warhol.) There follows a moment of vertigo: instead of driving, one has been flying; instead of exploring, one has been perpetually plunging. This simultaneous effacement and enactment of depth is one of Ballard’s greatest achievements. In fact, the post-Warholian displacement of depth, the removal of it as an aesthetic criterion, is one of the qualities most important in Ballard. As far as I’m aware, he did not spend a moment mourning it. Nor does he, like the 1980s Brat Pack writers, allow a satire of vacuity to be deduced by morally sophisticated readers. Patrick Bateman may be the genetic successor of Ballard’s emptied heroes, but Ballard is never so obvious as to leave behind a trail of eviscerated bodies. He is, instead, strangely gentle with his characters, even when injuring them – almost, at times, courteous in his approach to their demise. In Ballard’s writing, there are things which are there, which fill pagespace, but which function only to assert their own irrelevance. That the male and female characters are sexually attractive is, after you’ve read a book or two, taken as a sine qua non. This is the libidinal economy within which the Ballardian exchanges take place. It is a post-pill world. No female character can get pregnant, because that would impede the narrative flow; and if any woman does get pregnant, she must have an abortion immediately, silently. Children rarely feature as important\n\nFOREWORD\n\nx\n\ncharacters. What can happen sometimes, without ever mattering, is love. Though it is very likely to be over before it is described as such. All emotions go nowhere, unless they hasten destruction or self-destruction. In a Ballard novel we expect certain events, and expect them not to bother us particularly; we are instead reading for the rhythm – it is in the wavelength or the pulse of each novel that its true meaning lies. Ballard’s periodicity has always been spot on: he leaves out exactly the right things. Technology is central to his vision, but, at the same time, entirely irrelevant to it. The plots of his stories and novels almost never depend upon a recent invention (unless the automobile is recent). It is new conditions rather than new devices which he perceives; services rather than goods. There is a particular Ballard-sentence. They lead up to and then away from the comma. Very often, the first half of the sentence gets the respectable, necessary job of narration out of the way. There follows a pause, after which the dreamworld of the novel floods through, most often in simile. Each book has its parallel world, from which its comparative imagery is drawn. But also, in some novels, there is a closed-circuit of reference, where a simile in one part of a book (Crash is perhaps the strongest example of this) refers or seems to refer to an object or incident at the other end of the book. On a level of similitude, it is emphasized that – from this particular world – there is no escape. The works of few living writers could withstand the attentions of a two-day academic conference. That, at the end of ‘From Shanghai to Shepperton’, it still felt as if there was much more to be said, as if we had only started to establish a basic knowledge of the territory, was an indication of the enduring strangeness of Ballard’s world.\n\nNote 1.\n\nDeleuze, G. and Guattari, F.

The explosion of reading groups and literary blogs, of university courses and school curricula, and even the apparent rude health of the literary marketplace, indicate an ever-growing appetite for new work, for writing which responds to the complex, changing and challenging times in which we live. At the same time, readers seem ever more eager to engage in conversations about their reading, to devour the review pages, to pack the sessions at literary festivals and author events. Reading is an increasingly social activity, as we seek to share and refine our experiences of books, to clarify and extend our understanding. It is this tremendous enthusiasm for contemporary fiction to which the Contemporary Critical Perspectives series responds. Our ambition is to offer readers of current fiction a comprehensive critical account of each author’s work, presenting original, specially commissioned analyses of all aspects of their careers, from a variety of different angles and approaches, as well as directions towards further reading and research. Our brief to our contributors is to be scholarly, to draw on the latest thinking about narrative, or philosophy, or psychology, indeed whatever seemed to them most significant in drawing out the meanings and force of the texts in question, but also to focus closely on the words on the page, the stories and scenarios and forms which all of us meet first when we open a book. We insisted that these essays be accessible to that mythical beast, the Common Reader, who might just as readily be spotted at the Lowdham Book Festival as in a college seminar. In this way, we hope to have presented critical assessments of our writers in such a way as to contribute something to both of those environments and also to have done something to bring together the important qualities of each of them.

Ballard and the Contemporary JEANNETTE BAXTER\n\nBALLARDIAN: (adj) 1. of James Graham Ballard (J. G. Ballard; born 1930), the British novelist, or his works. (2) resembling or suggestive of the conditions described in Ballard’s novels & stories, esp. dystopian modernity, bleak manmade landscapes & the psychological effects of technological, social or environmental developments.\n\nJ. G. Ballard’s entry into the Collins English Dictionary provides a useful starting point for this collection. The first meaning of Ballardian invokes one of the most significant and challenging writers of the contemporary period. In the course of a career spanning over half a century, Ballard has produced a diverse and voluminous body of work which has courted literary praise and cultural controversy in almost equal measure. While the publication of Crash (1973) initiated cries of moral outrage and accusations of wilful perversity from its readers and reviewers, the publication of Empire of the Sun (1984) initiated a round of critical acclaim, winning the Guardian Fiction and the James Tate Black Memorial prizes, and narrowly missing out on the Booker Prize. Subsequent adaptations of these novels to screen by David Cronenberg (Crash, 1995) and Steven Spielberg (Empire of the Sun, 1987) have gone some way to cementing Ballard’s place and popularity within the wider cultural imagination. The same can be said for Ballard’s non-fictional writings (essays, reviews) which have appeared in publications as various as the Times, Vogue, the Daily Telegraph and Playboy. That Ballard is recognized and valued as a contemporary cultural commentator is evident in Jason Cowley’s witty observation that whenever the nation found itself plunged into moments of crisis or trauma (the death of Princess Diana, for instance, or a terrorist attack), the following cry would echo through the Times newsroom: ‘Call J. G. Ballard’ (Cowley: 2001). Apparently, Ballard was seldom at home. Or if he was, he was not answering the phone. It is precisely this ability to anticipate and give an account of the myriad realities of our disturbed modernity to which the second meaning of Ballardian points. Indeed, Ballard, the so-called Seer of Shepperton, has acquired something of a reputation for predicting some of the more unusual shifts within contemporary culture. Most famously in The Atrocity Exhibition (1970), Ballard imagined the rise of Ronald Reagan\n\n2\n\nJ. G. BALLARD\n\nfrom Hollywood Cowboy to US President. Then, following the death of Princess Diana in a Parisian underpass in 1997, Salman Rushdie wrote a piece for The New Yorker in which he suggested how the parameters of the Princess’s life and death – a pornographic tale of sex, death and celebrity – had been sketched out, to some degree, in Ballard’s Crash. A more recent demonstration of Ballard’s prescience occurred with the publication of Millennium People (2003), a story of terrorist violence which opens with the bombing of Terminal 2 at Heathrow airport. Within months of the novel’s completion, anti-terrorist forces rolled into Heathrow Airport in response to a threatened Al-Qaeda attack. Within this context, Ballardian also functions as a kind of trigger for conjuring up a series of distinctive images and landscapes which capture the contemporary condition in all of its violence and ambiguity: murdered celebrities, crashed cars, surveillance technologies, media politicians, gated communities, vast shopping malls; drowned cities, nuclear weapons ranges and testing sites, landscaped business parks. These are just a few of the objects and architectures that make up the world of a J. G. Ballard novel or short story. What is important to bear in mind, however, is that their Ballardian resonance lies less in their straightforward recognizability and more in the way in which these familiar aspects of contemporary culture are rendered strange and unnerving. If the adjective Ballardian is to be understood as providing some kind of mirror on the contemporary world, then it is a mirror which distorts. At the same time that Ballard’s inscription into the English language can be taken as a sign of cultural and literary recognition – a term that has been operating unofficially amongst Ballard readers and scholars for years has finally been authorized and made official – this act of recuperation poses certain problems for a writer like Ballard. Following the commercial and critical success of Empire of the Sun, for instance, Ballard was offered a CBE (Commander of the Order of the British Empire) medal which he turned down, saying: ‘I just don’t want anything to do with all that nonsense, a Ruritanian charade that helps to prop up our top-heavy monarchy’ (Ballard cited in Baxter 2004: 35). As the novelist Toby Litt puts it in his Foreword to this collection, this is the voice of J. G. Ballard as ‘outsider-insider, or insider-outsider’ who remains resistant to the lures of assimilation. We can trace Ballard’s disquiet with his adopted country back to the ‘shock’ which he insists he felt when he first encountered postwar London: When I actually arrived in 1946 I found a London that looked like Bucharest with a hangover – heaps of rubble, an exhausted ferret-like people defeated by war and still deluded by Churchillian rhetoric, hobbling around a wasteland of poverty, ration books and grotesque social division. (Ballard 1996d: 185)\n\nTo the dislocated expatriate from war-torn Shanghai, England was a foreign country, an imaginary homeland that did not quite live up to the\n\nJ. G. BALLARD AND THE CONTEMPORARY\n\n3\n\npicture-book images which Ballard had been force-fed as a young boy. This is a point which Sebastian Groes picks up and develops in his chapter in this volume. Focusing on Ballard’s literary representations of London, Groes places the spatial embodiment of British political, cultural and economic power at the heart of Ballard’s imagination in order to examine the author’s ambivalent relationship towards England and its capital city. Tracing Ballard’s first encounter with London back to the network of signs, stories and fictions which circulated throughout colonial Shanghai and Lunghua camp, Groes reads London as a master narrative which Ballard’s writing attempts to dislocate. What Groes’s reading illustrates is how Ballard’s initial sense of physical alienation soon developed into one of social and psychological estrangement as he began to reflect critically on England’s class-ridden system and its allegiance to Empire: ‘In short, did the English pay a fearful price for the system of self-delusions that underpinned almost everything in their lives?’ The question, he continues, ‘played a large role in the difficulty I had settling down here. It fed into my troubled sense of who I was, and encouraged me to think of myself as a lifelong outsider and maverick’ (Ballard 2008: 127). No wonder, then, that Ballard flatly refused to become an honorary member of what he perceived to be a political fiction. It comes as no surprise to learn that, in the same year that Ballard refused the CBE, he also turned down membership of the Royal Society of Literature (Oramus 2007: 267). After all, Ballard has become defined precisely by his decision to operate on the fringes of literary culture. He is, as Roger Luckhurst has argued, one of those ‘awkward voices who refuse to play the literary game; their off-centre locations echo their ex-centric, discomfiting writings’ (1997: xii). Ballard’s authorial ex-centricity is clearly delineated in his initial decision in the 1950s to reject the dominant mode of social realism and the extreme innovations of literary modernism in favour of science fiction. Whilst Ballard considered the stylistic conventions of the social realist novel (‘sequential narrative, characters “in the round”, consecutive events, balloons of dialogue attached to “he said” and “she said”’ (Ballard 1996g: 126)) to be outmoded and imaginatively restrictive in a postwar climate of capitalist expansion and cultural transformation (Ballard 1996g: 126–30), he deemed the experimental aesthetics of James Joyce and T. S. Eliot to be ‘alienated’, ‘introverted’ and thus thoroughly inappropriate (Ballard 1996c: 205). Instead, with its long tradition of innovative response to science, technology and rapidly shifting political and cultural climates, Ballard identified science fiction as the only authentic literature of the day: At present, science fiction is almost the only form of fiction which is thriving, and certainly the only fiction which has any influence on the world around it. [. . .] In essence, science fiction is a response to science and technology as perceived by the inhabitants of the consumer goods society, and recognises\n\n4\n\nJ. G. BALLARD that the role of the writer today has totally changed – he is now merely one of a huge army of people filling the environment with fictions of every kind. (Ballard 1996c: 205–6)\n\nIn contrast to the parochialism of mainstream literature, science fiction’s expansive vision promised to respond to the competing vocabularies of the late twentieth century – science, technology, advertising, capitalism, consumerism – in a way that just might make sense. This was a process of intelligibility which also called for a transformed sense of what it was to be a writer: in a world saturated by fictions of every kind, the contemporary writer’s job was not to overlay these external fictions with his or her own private fantasies, but to ‘invent the reality’ (Ballard 1995: Introduction). Although Ballard’s appropriation of science fiction situated him outside of the literary mainstream, his refusal simply to adopt traditional science-fiction tropes and conventions meant that his ex-centricity was doubled (see Luckhurst 1997: 1–36). The so-called ‘Voice’ of the New Wave science-fiction movement, Ballard published a controversial and provocative manifesto which set out to re-map the trajectories of postwar British science fiction: ‘Which Way to Inner Space?’ (1962). Contemptuous of science fiction’s generic constraints and hackneyed subject matter of ‘interstellar travel, extraterrestrial life forms, galactic wars and physical scientific facts’ (Ballard 1996i: 197), this polemic called for a highly innovative form of science-fiction writing which would no longer look to the skies, but keep a critical and creative eye on the ‘alien’ landscapes of the contemporary period. Furthermore, turning its back on the ‘rocket ships and ray guns’ (Ballard 1996i: 195) of outer space, Ballard’s renewed and renewable form of science-fiction writing would set off in search of ‘inner space’; that is a series of shifting and hybrid imaginative geographies in which the outer world of reality and the inner world of the psyche fuse in a number of fascinating and startling ways. This is the imaginative territory which Brian Baker maps in his wide-ranging chapter. Offering a reassessment of Ballard’s early short stories and novels within the contexts of New Worlds and New Wave writing, Baker explores Ballard’s antagonistic relationship towards genre science fiction in order to set up a series of anti-dystopian readings which insist on the symbolic rather than the social significance of Ballard’s imagination. Focusing on the importance of the Space Age to the iconography of Ballard’s short stories and novels, Baker then goes on to challenge the extent to which the provocative manifesto, ‘Which Way to Inner Space?’ (1962), engenders a departure from the topoi of outer space. He does so, however, in order to demonstrate how New Wave science fiction in general, and Ballardian science fiction in particular, constituted a radically experimental form of contemporary\n\nJ. G. BALLARD AND THE CONTEMPORARY\n\n5\n\nliterature which would go on to pose difficult and urgent questions pertaining to time, subjectivity, history and reality. Most notably, Ballard’s experimentalism manifested itself in his transformation of science fiction along visual lines of influence. Specifically, Ballard looked to cinema, Surrealist painting and Pop Art, representational forms, which, for him, had become ‘more and more concerned with the creation of new states of mind, constructing fresh symbols and languages where the old cease to be valid’ (Ballard 1996i: 197). In contrast to the ‘technological pantomime’ (Ballard 1996e; 16) which one would find in films such as Star Wars (1977), Ballardian science fiction engaged creatively and critically with the contemporaneous French New Wave cinema. In his numerous journalistic writings on European and World cinema, for instance, Ballard foregrounds two innovative and influential works: La Jetée (1962) by Chris Marker and Alphaville (1965) by Jean-Luc Goddard. A fusion of photomontage (the film is entirely constructed from still photographs), science fiction and ‘psychological fable’ La Jetée is a post-nuclear narrative in which time, space and reality are radically dislocated. As Ballard notes, it is precisely the succession of disconnected images which this short film boasts that creates ‘a series of potent images of the inner landscapes of time’ (Ballard 1996f: 28). Alphaville, meanwhile, draws on the iconography of Pop Art, comic books and film noir precisely in order to place the most alien planet – Earth – under scrutiny. Ballard writes how the alienated landscape of Alphaville is utterly indistinguishable from contemporary Paris: ‘Godard makes the point that in the media landscape of the present day the fantasies of science fiction are as “real” as an office block, an airport or a presidential campaign’ (Ballard 1996h: 19). As Corin Depper argues in his chapter, cinema remains a powerful expression of contemporary culture for Ballard at the same time that if offers new and alternative ways of responding to contemporary culture. Reading The Atrocity Exhibition (1970), Crash (1973), and Empire of the Sun (1984) through their filmic adaptations, Depper illustrates how Ballard’s cinematic imagination continues to raise complex questions about form, time, narrative and movement in, and across, written and visual texts. Depper’s critical enquiry remains haunted by one persistent question, however, why are three texts which are so intimately bound up with the mechanics, history and spirit of cinema so resistant to their own transformation into images? Although Ballard has always expressed an eclectic taste for the visual arts, two twentieth-century art movements stand out as particular influences on his writing career: Surrealism and Pop Art. Identifying compatibility between Surrealism’s enquiries into the unconscious, Pop Art’s obsession with the circulating images and objects of the media and consumer landscapes, and his own abstract and analytical mode\n\n6\n\nJ. G. BALLARD\n\nof science fiction, Ballard set about constructing a creative and critical analysis of both the chaotic surface realities of contemporary culture and its hidden, unconscious depths: The subject matter of science fiction is the subject matter of everyday life: the gleam on refrigerator cabinets, the contours of a wife’s or husband’s thighs passing the newsreel images on a colour TV set, the conjunction of musculature and chromium artefact within an automobile interior, the unique postures of passengers on an airport escalator – all in all, close to the world of the Pop painters and sculptors, Paolozzi, Hamilton, Warhol, Wesselman, Ruscha amongst others. (Ballard 1996c: 207)\n\nPop Art’s dedication to the aestheticization of everyday objects (cars, celebrities, cans of soup, soap powder boxes, kettles, Coca Cola bottles) combined with its taste for literatures of mass culture (comic books, magazines, advertising brochures) provided Ballard with an ally. Indeed, as early as 1956 when Ballard visited what has commonly been celebrated as the birth of British Pop Art, the ‘This is Tomorrow’ exhibition (held at Whitechapel Gallery, London), Ballard recognized a keen affinity with Pop Art’s revisioning of consumer goods, mass-advertising, and modern communications, and his own personal vision of how science fiction should develop as both an analysis of contemporary culture and an art of the now. Ballard’s associations with Pop Art proved to be particularly intense and fruitful during the late 1960s and early 1970s, and some of the most formally experimental and contextually challenging work of this period was carried out in collaboration with Eduardo Paolozzi – sculptor; screen printer; science fiction fan and late twentieth-century Surrealist. Surrealism has shaped the imaginative and critical trajectories of Ballard’s writing from the beginning of his career (see Baxter 2009). Its visual and literary influences are evident, for instance, in Ballard’s first science fiction short story, Prima Belladonna, which was published in New Worlds in 1956. Surrealism’s drive to dismantle boundaries between the unconscious and conscious, self and object, reason and imagination in order to liberate the mind and spirit from the paralysing sphere of rationalist thought spoke directly to Ballard’s non-realist desire to explore ‘a heightened or alternate reality beyond that familiar to our senses’ (Ballard 1996b: 84). In Surrealism, Ballard not only recognized a common need to dismantle socially constructed notions of identity, subjectivity, and reality in order to open art, literature, history and politics to new ways of seeing, but he also recognized an aesthetic practice that was particularly appropriate to the post-Second World War era: ‘The techniques of surrealism have a particular relevance at this moment when the fictional elements in the world around us are multiplying to the point where it is almost impossible to distinguish between the ‘“real” and the “false”’ (Ballard 1996b: 88). For Ballard, the\n\nJ. G. BALLARD AND THE CONTEMPORARY\n\n7\n\nsignificance of Surrealist aesthetic practices (such as collage, montage, psychic automatism) lay in their ability to penetrate the sub-texts of the contemporary consumer landscape and to expose the network of unconscious energies and insidious psychologies at work within it. It is this Surrealist aspect of Ballard’s writing which Jake Huntley sets out to illuminate and interrogate in his essay. Reading The Atrocity Exhibition as a radical textual experimental which is still in process, Huntley explores questions of characterization, narrative time and form, and textual (re)composition in relation to Ballard’s literary Surrealism. Revised, rewritten and extended with additional stories, authorial notes, illustrations and photographs, the latest version of The Atrocity Exhibition, Huntley suggests, may be read as a contemporary Surrealist performance. Beyond its aesthetic innovations, Surrealist art and literature also provided Ballard with complex and often ambiguous ways of (re)thinking and re-presenting contemporary history. With their hidden perspectives and concealed energies, the time-saturated landscapes of Salvador Dali, Max Ernst and Paul Delvaux (among others) offered up alternative and provocative historical indexes. For Ballard, the confrontation with ‘past traumas and experiences’ and the ‘discharging of fears and obsessions’ (Ballard 1996: 146) which preoccupied Surrealist painting confirmed its historical and psychological significance in the age of Auschwitz and Hiroshima. Following the Surrealists’ visual investigations into latent and manifest forms of historical violence, Ballard’s writings have staged a series of complex, and often ethically challenging, enquiries into contemporary representations of historical atrocity. As a result of this work, a tenacious critical perception of the author has become established which pictures him as a nihilistic and solipsistic historical voyeur whose writing is emotionally detached and morally vacuous. This is a historical picture of J. G. Ballard which many of the essays in this collection confront and challenge. Indeed, responding to the current (re)turn to history in contemporary literature and criticism, the contributors to this collection offer critical perspectives which reread Ballard’s work as complex and controversial engagements with history, memory and trauma. One consequence of this step towards historicizing Ballard’s work is that it reveals the inadequacy and inaccuracy of the second meaning of Ballardian which places his work within a rigid framework of dystopian loss. This is far too simplistic and reductive a way of thinking about how Ballard’s writings engage with twentieth and twenty-first century histories. While texts such as The Atrocity Exhibition and Crash are in thrall to contemporary representations of war, death and mutilation, the waning or ‘death of affect’ produced by the texts’ relentlessly violent energies also sets up exigent discussion about the erosion of moral and critical distance within contemporary culture. This is an area for critical discussion which Jeannette Baxter pursues in her chapter. Challenging dystopian readings of Ballard’s European fictions, Baxter\n\n8\n\nJ. G. BALLARD\n\nrereads Cocaine Nights (1966) and Super-Cannes (2000) as nightmarishly utopian in impulse. In the absence of history, morality and memory, she suggests, the ‘nowheres’ of Ballard’s postwar Europes emerge as dangerous breeding grounds for neo-fascistic forms of power, violence, and aestheticized racism. Yet at the same time that the process of reading these texts challenges us, the readers, to immerse ourselves in their deviant logics and emerging psychopathologies, it also forces us to confront some rather unnerving questions about our own complicity in the criminal horror of contemporary European culture and history. Ballard’s postmillennial fictions continue to explore disquieting issues of historical guilt, amnesia and complicity by exhibiting repeated acts of meaningless violence and perversion. This is an ambiguous fictional trajectory which Phil Tew charts in his chapter. Drawing on René Girard’s work on violence, sacrifice and community, Tew explores what he sees as a homicidal compulsion at work in Super-Cannes, Millennium People (2003) and Kingdom Come (2006). Evaluating representations of compulsive violence in Ballard’s recent fictional phase and the earlier novels of Crash and Concrete Island (1974), Tew considers the sense of communal unease and violent aggression that dominates these postmillennial fictions in relation to complex questions of ritual, sacrifice and trauma. As Tew’s reading of the evil and redemptive possibilities of Ballardian representations of sacrificial violence suggest, ambivalence is a key word when thinking about Ballard’s writings. Ballard is fascinated by both the creative and the destructive nature of violence; his work records the eradication of historical reality within contemporary visual culture at the same time that it sets out to recover it; he carries out cool and analytical dissections of contemporary culture which are fiercely emotional, ethically engaged and highly amusing. This latter, and much neglected, dimension of Ballard’s writing is one which Victor Sage gives focus to in his reading of Crash. Paying close attention to the parodic textures of Ballard’s pornographic language, Sage explores the ways in which Ballard’s deadpan humour emerges as a primary medium for Gothic effects. The force of this kind of rereading lies in its move to confront the ambivalent and unnerving mixture of horror and humour in Crash: replete with gothic jokes and grotesque metaphors, Sage suggests, Crash can be read as a radical and ambivalent encyclopaedia of imaginary perversions which are rich in satirical and social critique. It is this sense of Ballard’s work as a prolonged experiment in the representation of tensions and ambiguities inherent in contemporary history, culture and language which renders the very existence of the definition ‘Ballardian’ distinctly odd, even redundant. In some ways, Ballard’s entire literary project can be seen as an unrelenting challenge to the very systems of order, classification and knowledge which texts such as dictionaries and encyclopaedias put in place. Highly innovative short stories such as ‘Notes Towards A Mental Breakdown’ (1976) and ‘The Index’ (1977) flaunt an irreverence to the authority, coherency and\n\nJ. G. BALLARD AND THE CONTEMPORARY\n\n9\n\nveracity of linguistic systems. ‘Notes Towards a Mental Breakdown’ consists of an 18 word headline in which each word is explained in a series of footnotes that are laid out in textual blocks. What quickly emerges in the process of reading, however, is that the text’s footnotes contradict and undermine one another at every turn. Instead of offering a continuous and complete scientific report on the mental health of an anonymous Broadmoor patient, Ballard’s story functions as a parody of realist forms of documentation which lay claim to certainty. Fittingly, the story ends on a paradoxical note: ‘It seems possible that although the synopsis conceals a maze of lies and distortions, it is a simple and incontrovertible statement of truth’ (Ballard 1976: 855). ‘The Index’ continues in this manner, taking the form of a ‘found document’ which the reader is encouraged (by an attached ‘Editorial note’) to interpret as the index to ‘the unpublished and perhaps suppressed autobiography of a man who may well have been one of the most remarkable figures of the 20th century [. . .] Henry Rhodes Hamilton’ (Ballard 1977: 940). Again there is no single, coherent narrative to be made from these partial fragments of alphabetized knowledge. The reader may be seduced into attempting to forge narrative links by cross-referencing certain events or personalities recorded in the Index, but such attempts are ultimately rendered futile: just as the life of Henry Rhodes Hamilton (whomever he may be) cannot be contained or ordered within this particular linguistic system neither can it be decoded and made intelligible. It is in the contexts of definition and categorization that we can return to the first meaning of the word ‘Ballardian’ in order to problematize it further. As a number of the commentators in this collection argue, Ballard’s repeated interrogations into the unstable nature of identity and subjectivity through fictionalized versions of himself not only raise complex issues of textual authority, authorial reliability and the ethics of life-writing, but they also pose the question: who is J. G. Ballard? This is an intricate and elusive line of enquiry which Umberto Rossi follows in his chapter. Tracing the interpenetration of factual and fictional histories across three versions of Ballard’s life, Empire of the Sun, The Kindness of Women (1991) and Miracles of Life (2008), Rossi explores the intertextual nature of these works within the specific context of war literature. By insisting that Ballard’s texts should be read as generically distinct from one another, Rossi focuses on the ways in which specific textual features and narrative techniques encourage a simultaneous engagement with, and disengagement from, complex narratives of historical violence, trauma and memory. At the same time that each literary rendering of Ballard’s life invites the reader to make connections between the author and his fictional selves, he suggests, any straightforward manoeuvre to locate coherency and consistency in and across Ballard’s war narratives is rendered redundant. Although the question – who is J. G. Ballard? – remains a compelling one, it is ultimately hollow because, in a sense, there is no one J. G. Ballard\n\n10\n\nJ. G. BALLARD\n\nto be found. As Toby Litt suggests in his Afterword, all critical moves to capture, know and ‘explain’ J. G. Ballard and his work are fraught with ambiguities, paradoxes and, ultimately, uncertainty. But perhaps this is, in part, what makes J. G. Ballard (whomever he may be) a contemporary writer. In much the same way that the contemporary is a mutable and renewable cultural category which evades easy categorization, so J. G. Ballard and his work continue to elude definition.\n\nCHAPTER ONE\n\nThe Geometry of the Space Age: J. G. Ballard’s Short Fiction and Science Fiction of the 1960s BRIAN BAKER\n\nChapter Summary: Taking Ballard’s New Worlds manifesto, ‘Which Way to Inner Space?’ as its starting point, this chapter explores the implication of time, space and psychology in Ballard’s early fiction. Baker traces the connections between Ballard’s early novels and the development of his short fiction and attempts to map out the different phases of his exploration of the inner space age. Key Words: The Drowned World; The Drought; The Crystal World; science fiction; inner space; space-time continuum; psychology; space age; fugue states; short story form; New Worlds; ‘Which Way to Inner Space?’; evolutionary biology\n\nThe relationship between J. G. Ballard and the genre of science fiction (sf) is an unusual one. Ballard was first published in the British sf magazine Science Fantasy, one of several edited by E. J. ‘Ted’ Carnell in the 1950s. Ballard’s first novel, The Drowned World, was serialized in another of this stable, a magazine called Science Fiction Adventures in 1962, and many other stories were published in the most famous of this group, New Worlds. Edited by Carnell until 1964, when Michael Moorcock assumed the editorship, New Worlds was the most important British sf magazine in the postwar period until the cessation of its monthly publication schedule in 1970 (it has since been revived by Moorcock and\n\n12\n\nJ. G. BALLARD\n\nothers in a variety of formats). Carnell and then Moorcock oversaw the rise to prominence of a generation of British sf writers that included Moorcock himself, Ballard, John Brunner and Brian Aldiss. In the Encyclopaedia of Science Fiction, John Clute and Peter Nicholls describe New Worlds as at first providing ‘a stable domestic market for the leading UK writers [and] encouraged a species of sf more sober in tone than much US material [which] began a shift in emphasis towards psychological and existential sf’ (Clute and Nicholls 1999: 868, col.1). Under Moorcock’s editorship from 1964, New Worlds would become the home of the ‘New Wave’ in sf, a late flowering of Modernist topoi and textual practice in the science fiction genre. The archetypal New Wave sf story was textually experimental and formally and/or generically self-conscious; alienated from the mores and conventions of contemporary mainstream culture (and mainstream ‘literary’ writing); often influenced by models of depth-psychology with regard to its protagonists; and with a cynical, dystopian or counter-cultural political flavour, quite often symbolized in the generic use of the scientific concept of entropy. Ballard is a central New Worlds and New Wave writer. His story ‘The Terminal Beach’ (1964), which narrates, in a series of titled paragraphs, the journey to the nuclear-testing site island of Eniwetok of an alienated protagonist called ‘Traven’, treats of the images and ideas of the Cold War in an oblique and disturbing way. The story can be seen as offering a kind of template for Ballard’s own later career (the ‘T-’ character is central to the ‘condensed novels’ later collected in The Atrocity Exhibition of 1970) and even of New Wave short fiction as a whole (one thinks of Moorcock’s ‘Jerry Cornelius’ sequence of stories and Pamela Zoline’s seminal ‘Heat Death of the Universe’ (1967)). Ballard’s textual practice, and his ideas and manifestoes such as the guest editorial in a 1962 edition of New Worlds later collected as ‘Which Way to Inner Space?’, were crucial to the development of New Wave sf in the 1960s, but his connection to mainstream sf has always been problematic, even more so than the New Wave in general. In the Encyclopaedia of Science Fiction, Clute and Nicholls underscore this tension by noting that Ballard has never won an award from within the sf community for his work, and his Nebula Award nomination for ‘The Drowned Giant’ in 1964 was for a text which is untypical of Ballard’s work as a whole. In this chapter, I want to explore Ballard’s problematic association with mainstream sf. Specifically, I chart the ways in which Ballard’s fictions of the 1960s move away from postwar models of sf writing, characterized by the US dystopian tradition and the peculiarly British tradition of the ‘disaster novel’, towards a new and idiosyncratic form of sf writing which is marked out by processes of physical and psychological transformation which are both ambiguous and ambivalent. Although Ballard’s early fictions have been attacked for not being\n\nJ. G. BALLARD’S SHORT FICTION\n\n13\n\novertly interested in the kinds of social and political critique which certain literary critics expect and value, it is my contention that Ballard’s fictions are not entirely dislocated from the socio-cultural landscapes of the postwar period. As the title of my chapter indicates, it is not the Cold War but the Space Age (partly concurrent but definitely not coterminous) which regulates the imaginary and iconography of Ballard’s early fiction, and is at the same time abstracted, made strange. Through a series of close textual readings, I explore the ways in which Ballard subverts sf tropes and conventions in order to produce a different kind of ‘space fiction’, namely one which explores the deep implications of time, space, psychology and evolutionary biology in order to dismantle anthropocentric narratives and, in turn, open up alternative ways of experiencing, and conceiving of, contemporary human subjectivity.\n\nTowards a poetics of transformation: rereading Ballard’s ‘space fiction’ In order to fully understand Ballard’s significance it is necessary to contextualize the British sf scene in relation to that of the USA. Brian Aldiss (1973) and Roger Luckhurst (2005), in their respective histories of sf, locate a ‘twin tradition’ at work within the history of Englishlanguage sf: the British tradition of the ‘scientific romance’, inaugurated by H .G. Wells and inherited by John Wyndham, John Christopher, and in his early career, Ballard himself; and the US ‘pulp’ tradition, from Hugo Gernsback’s Amazing (from 1927), to John W. Campbell’s Astounding Science Fiction (from 1937), to H. L. Gold’s Galaxy Science Fiction (from 1950). These crucial magazines and editorships shaped the development of North American sf and the careers of such canonical sf writers as Isaac Asimov, Robert Heinlein and Frederik Pohl. This tradition encompasses the kind of ‘hard sf’ that is based upon scientific and technical knowledge, and in the case of the Campbellian interest in ESP or ‘psionics’, at least the rigorous exploration or extrapolation of such a ‘novum’ (see Darko Suvin’s (1971) term for an invention or innovation from which the sf world is extrapolated) upon the world created. In the 1950s, US sf turned more towards the dystopian, sociological and satirical mode, probably in reaction to the Cold War and the corporate, consumerist, suburban and conformist imperatives of the Eisenhower years. Classic dystopian sf, such as Vonnegut’s Player Piano (1952), Ray Bradbury’s Fahrenheit 451 (1953) or Pohl and Cyril M. Kornbluth’s The Space Merchants (1953), offers satirical visions of a world of superabundance, of a material plenty that masks an underlying totalization of political and cultural life. These consumerist dystopias were much praised by Kingsley Amis in his New Maps of Hell (1961), an early critical essay on sf for a mainstream audience (and first given as a series of lectures at Princeton). Amis also praised Ballard’s early work: on the back\n\n14\n\nJ. G. BALLARD\n\nof the 1965 Penguin edition of The Drowned World, he is quoted as declaring ‘Ballard is one of the brightest new stars in post-war fiction.’ This enthusiasm waned as the 1960s drew on and Ballard began to publish his Atrocity Exhibition texts. As Ballard himself has commented, Amis was no fan of the political radicalism and literary experimentation of the New Wave with its ‘shock tactics, tricks with typography, one-lined chapters, strained metaphors, obscurities [and] obscenities’ (Ballard 1996b: 190). However, it is clear to see why Amis might have been attracted to Ballard’s early work, particularly that which is in a dystopian vein: ‘The Concentration City’, published in 1957 (set in a vast, literally endless urban accretion) and ‘The Subliminal Man’ of 1963 (in which the protagonist discovers that subliminal road signs are driving the furious energies of consumerism) can certainly be seen as variants of the 1950s American vein of satirical, dystopian sf, though both of these stories were published in New Worlds rather than in an American magazine. The ultimate failure of the protagonist to resist the pressures of consumerism in ‘The Subliminal Man’, however, marks Ballard’s subtle difference from his US counterparts (who usually offer some kind of moment of suspended possibility of change at the end of the text), and points towards the embracing of catastrophe that is found in The Drowned World and elsewhere. It has also brought critical opprobrium down upon Ballard’s head. H. Bruce Franklin, in his essay ‘What Are We To Make Of J. G. Ballard’s Apocalypse?’ (1979) is highly critical of Ballard’s ‘failure’ to offer a sustained critique of the capitalist imperatives that drive his human subjects towards alienation, dislocation and ultimately possible psychological fragmentation. Franklin argues about Ballard’s reliance on depth-psychology: My criticism is that Ballard does not generally go down far enough below the unconscious to the sources of the alienation, self-destruction, and mass slaughter of our age. He therefore remains incapable of understanding the alternative to these death forces, the global movement toward human liberation which constitutes the main distinguishing characteristic of our epoch. (Franklin 1979: 93)\n\nBallard’s work is characterized by Franklin as ‘ultimately a literature of despair, negation and death’ (Franklin 1979: 93), and he reserves his praise only for ‘The Subliminal Man’, which is much closer to the kind of critical and dystopian works one finds in 1950s American sf. Franklin reproduces a common critical trope in considering Ballard, the tendency to attack him not for what he does, but for what he does not do: offer a left-oriented critique of contemporary capital, and the possibility of resistance to its determinations. Ballard has demonstrated very little overt interest in the ideological premises of the world he lives in, or the worlds he creates. Later texts such as Running Wild (1988), Super-Cannes (2000) or Kingdom Come (2006)\n\nJ. G. BALLARD’S SHORT FICTION\n\n15\n\nindicate an interest in the control of social (and particularly privatized) space which is of considerable contemporary political urgency, but it is also possible to see these texts in similar terms to the psychological narratives he produced in the early and mid-1960s. The thematic interest in space is apparent in such early stories as ‘The Concentration City’ (1957), where the search for ‘free space’ (Ballard 2001: 25) leads to an ultimately circular journey around a globe now encased in urban ‘buildup’ (Ballard 2001: 27). More typically, in stories such as ‘Manhole 69’ (1957), a group of postoperative patients (whose need for sleep has been surgically excised) find themselves trapped in a consensual hallucination of collapsing space: ‘The gymnasium was shrinking. Inch by inch, the walls were moving inward . . . As they shrank towards each other their features altered’ (Ballard 2001c: 60). In ‘The Enormous Space’ (1989), meanwhile, the first-person narrator retreats to smaller and smaller spaces, finally climbing into a freezer cabinet which contains his dead wife, where ‘a palace of ice will crystallise around us’ (Ballard 2001a: 1138). As with most of Ballard’s early fictions, the physical world of ‘The Enormous Space’ is an exterior manifestation of a psychological landscape; as Andrzej Gasiorek puts it, the events ‘depicted exteriorise psychological adjustments and transformation’ (2005: 32). Space is psychologized, and so the boundary between inner and outer worlds becomes blurred. Ballard’s main self-declared sf antecedent is Ray Bradbury, whose own relations to sf, fantasy and mainstream literary fiction are almost as problematic as Ballard’s own (See Ballard 1996a: 205–7). Ballard is usually understood to be writing out of a peculiarly British mode of sf: the ‘disaster novel’ of John Wyndham and John Christopher, what Brian Aldiss characterized as the ‘cosy catastrophe’ in which a group of men and women survive in an apocalyptic scenario and comfortingly (even heroically) retain a grasp on conventional social and cultural values (See Aldiss 1973: 294). The ‘cosiness’ of the catastrophe is a product of the unchanged state of subjectivity produced by the events of the novels. With the exception of The Wind from Nowhere (1962), Ballard’s first published (and later disowned) novel, written at speed to break him into professional writing, Ballard’s early novels and short stories depart radically from the formula of the British disaster novel. Indeed, finding in it a liberation from the subjectivity constructed by social and cultural institutions, Ballard’s protagonists are only too eager to embrace the transformative possibilities of the disaster, even if this is at the cost of personal dissolution. David Punter indicates Ballard’s interest in challenging conventional encodings of human subjectivity, an argument which runs counter to Franklin’s assessment of Ballard’s ‘despairing, death-oriented’ narratives: The long tradition of enclosed and unitary subjectivity comes to mean less and less to him as he explores the ways in which person [sic] is increasingly controlled by landscape and machine, increasingly becomes a point of\n\n16\n\nJ. G. BALLARD intersection for overloaded scripts and processes which have effectively concealed their distant origins from human agency. (Punter 1985: 9)\n\nThis critique of human agency, most manifest in the seemingly ‘passive’ ways in which the protagonists of his fiction react to disaster, suggests a much keener edge to Ballard’s writing than Franklin allows. It is not that Ballard fails to move ‘below the unconscious’ to the determining ideological base, but that he focuses upon subjectivity itself as a crucial and constitutive framing of human experience. Perhaps, as Gregory Stephenson insists, there is a thirst for transcendence in Ballard’s fiction, a move, that is, towards an ‘absolute, authentic being . . . an ontological Eden’ (1991: 49), but it is subjectivity itself, and its corollary and condition, time, that first must be dissolved.\n\nDissolving time, space and subjectivity: or how to escape the contemporary Ballard’s recurrent interest in the Space Age is perhaps curious considering his 1962 New Worlds guest-editorial-cum-manifesto, ‘Which Way to Inner Space?’, which called for an sf not of rockets and naïve futurology, ‘robot brains and hyper-drives’ (Ballard 1996c: 195), but one that would take place on Earth; ‘it is inner space, not outer, that needs to be explored. The only true alien planet is Earth’ (Ballard 1996c: 197). Ballard nonetheless returned repeatedly to the icon of the astronaut in stories from ‘A Question of Re-Entry’ (1963) to ‘The Object of the Attack’ (1984), indicating the significance of the space programme to his concerns. In ‘A Question of Re-Entry’, he writes: The implication was that the entire space programme was a symptom of some inner unconscious malaise afflicting mankind, and in particular the Western technocracies, and that the space-craft and satellites had been launched because their flights satisfied certain buried compulsions and desires. (Ballard 2001g: 453)\n\nThe Space Age and the NASA programme is not in itself crucial: as elsewhere in Ballard’s work, it makes manifest latent or unconscious (‘buried’) human desires that underlie and precede the conscious, and the structuring of subjectivity. Underlying Ballard’s use of the icon of the astronaut is the sense that the NASA programme is a biological, or evolutionary, mistake, a kind of grand transgression against nature which produces unforeseen psychological consequences. In ‘Memories of the Space Age’ (1982), one of three connected stories from the early 1980s which return to similar ideas and images (the others being ‘News from the Sun’, 1981 and ‘Myths of the Near Future’, 1982), the\n\nJ. G. BALLARD’S SHORT FICTION\n\n17\n\nprotagonist Mallory, a doctor in the NASA programme, confesses to his unconscious complicity in the first orbital murder. He had allowed a borderline-disturbed astronaut named Hinton to go into space, where he had murdered one of his colleagues. This act produces a kind of ‘space-sickness’ of fugue-states and loss of temporal awareness that is centred on Cape Canaveral: ‘he had torn the fabric of time and space, cracked the hour-glass from which time was running’ (Ballard 2001d: 1049). The disaster is an evolutionary one, a hubristic giant leap out of the biological scheme, and out of time. This is made explicit in ‘News from the Sun’: ‘By leaving the planet and setting off into outer space man had committed an evolutionary crime, a breach of the rules governing his tenancy of the universe, and of the laws of time and space’ (Ballard 2001f: 1019). For Ballard’s protagonists the consequences are liberating as well as catastrophic. In his early-1980s trilogy of stories, as well as in ‘The Illuminated Man’ (1964), time is spatialized, coagulating like the jewelled forest of The Crystal World. This itself has an interior, psychological root: slowing or freezing time is connected to the ‘fugue’ states which the protagonists of these fictions increasingly experience. The symptoms of this ‘sickness’ are outlined in ‘Myths of the Near Future’: At first touching only a small minority of the population, it took root like a lingering disease in the interstices of its victims’ lives, in the slightest changes of habit and behaviour. Invariably there was the same reluctance to go out of doors, the abandonment of job, family and friends, a dislike of daylight, a gradual loss of weight and retreat into a hibernating self. (Ballard 2001e: 1064)\n\nThese symptoms are in fact the very model of the paths to alienation taken by Ballard’s protagonists in many of his fictional texts. What the Ballardian protagonists embrace is the transformative possibilities of the ‘disease’ that is a rupture in the fabric of space and time, but whether it is time itself or the protagonists’ experience of time remains unresolved. Inner and outer worlds are again blurred. In inhabiting ‘fugue time’, the protagonists become something other, yet are still themselves – perhaps a more full version of themselves, with linear time collapsed into spatial dimensions, onto their own bodies: A ruby light glimmered around Sheppard . . . He looked down at his wrists, at his incandescent fingers. The sun was annealing plates of copper light to his skin, dressing his arms and shoulders in a coronation of armour. Time was condensing around him, a thousand replicas from the past and future had invaded the present and clasped themselves to him. (Ballard 2001e: 1074)\n\n18\n\nJ. G. BALLARD\n\nIf time is the fourth dimension, then the jewelled armour that the crystallized subjects wear (a concretized version of their past and future selves encrusted on their limbs) in The Crystal World, (Ballard 1985a: 97, 98) or the dazzling figure of the decrepit Elaine revivified by her young self in ‘Myths of the Near Future’ (Ballard 2001e: 1067–8), are in a sense four-dimensional beings. (One of Ballard’s early short story collections was called The Four-Dimensional Nightmare.) When, in The Atrocity Exhibition, Dr Nathan explains to Margaret Travis about the ‘chronograms’ of Etienne-Jules Marey, which he describes as ‘“multiple-exposure photographs in which the element of time is visible”’ (Ballard 1985: 10), he is also revealing the master-image of Ballard’s sf texts. In The Crystal World or ‘Myths of the Near Future’, we see time played upon the very material being of the characters. The evolutionary emphases of these three stories explicitly connect Ballard’s later short fiction with his 1960s disaster novels. In fact, ‘Myths of the Near Future’ recapitulates the beginning of The Crystal World: in both, the protagonist travels into the heart of the ‘psychic disaster area’ (Ballard 2001e: 1068) where time has come to a stop, called by a letter received from a former wife/lover who imprecates ‘wish you were here’ (Ballard 2001e: 1068), this wife/lover being subject to a fatal disease which will be cured by the phenomenon through an escape from linear time. Where Sheppard’s wife Elaine in ‘Myths’ is wasting away through the onset of the ‘space sickness’ (Ballard 2000: 1064), in The Crystal World, Suzanne Clair has contracted the leprosy that she and the protagonist Sanders were attempting to minister to in their ‘leproserie’ (Ballard 1985a: 37). The ‘nodular lumps all over her face and in the lobes of her ear’, the ‘leonine mask’ which is one of the symptoms of leprosy (Ballard 1985a: 126), echo the encrusted, bejewelled world of the forest: The process of crystallization was more advanced. The fences along the road were so heavily encrusted that they formed a continuous palisade, a white frost at least six inches thick on either side of the palings. The few houses between the trees glistened like wedding-cakes, their white roofs and chimneys transformed into exotic minarets and baroque domes. On a lawn of green glass spurs a child’s tricycle glittered like a Fabergé gem, the wheels starred into brilliant jasper crowns. (Ballard 1985a: 75)\n\nThe connection between leprosy and crystallization underscores the foundational importance of the biological in these fictions. David Pringle suggests that the vegetation and self-immolated characters in The Crystal World become ‘embalmed in eternity’ (Pringle 1979: 32). Certainly, the bejewelled forest, itself a symbol of Heaven or the City of God, and the scenes where Father Balthus bestows the gem-encrusted cross onto Sanders to aid his survival (at the same time embracing his own crystallization) does seem to support a spiritual or religious reading of the text. Perhaps, though, the catastrophic zone can be more properly typed as paradisal, the return to a lost psychical or evolutionary Eden, before the\n\nJ. G. BALLARD’S SHORT FICTION\n\n19\n\nonset of human ‘civilization’. In ‘News from the Sun’, the infantile babble of the fugue-state is revealed as a kind of lost pre-lapsarian language: ‘“Leave Trippett . . .” Franklin tried to speak, but the words slurred on his tongue’ (Ballard 2000: 1035). Reverse evolution and the idea of a return before a ‘fall’ into language, culture and time are repeatedly overlaid. Even The Drought, the novel of the 1960s which least falls into this pattern, shares this rhetoric of reverse evolution, when Lomax tells the protagonist Ransom, pointing ‘to the dusty villas along the river . . . “They look like mud huts already. We’re moving straight back into the past”’ (Ballard 1985b: 46). In fact, in The Drought, a novel that falls into three unequal parts (the onset of the drought and the journey from Mont Royal to the beach; a period some years later when Ransom clings on to a precarious beach-zone existence with his formerly-estranged wife; and the return journey, having abandoned his wife, back to the city of Mont Royal), the suggestion is that Ransom has not moved back in time enough in the middle section, a kind of false hiatus in the long trajectory towards deep or symbolic time that characterizes all Ballard’s novels of this period. The strange children of Quilter and Miranda Lomax that Ransom encounters at the end of the novel also suggest mutation or transformation, the next generation being better adapted to the coming world, even if the spots of rain at the end of the novel – not felt by Ransom – suggest that the world is changing again (Ballard 1985b: 188). The evolutionary dynamic is most explicit in The Drowned World. Bodkin, the scientist who, like the protagonist Kerans, refuses to evacuate the flooded, tropical London they had been sent to investigate and map explains to Kerans the underlying biological or evolutionary dynamic at work: Everywhere there’s been the same avalanche backwards into the past . . . Everywhere in nature one sees evidence of innate releasing mechanisms literally millions of years old, which have lain dormant through thousands of generations but retained their power undiminished . . . I am convinced that as we move back through geophysical time so we re-enter the amniotic corridor and move back through spinal and archaeopsychic time, recollecting in our unconscious minds the landscapes of each epoch, each with a distinct geological terrain, its own unique flora and fauna, as recognizable to anyone else as they would be to a traveller in a Wellsian time machine. Except that this is no scenic railway, but a total re-orientation of the personality. (Ballard 1965: 43)\n\nThis long quotation requires a little unpacking. Note the insistent re-insertion of humankind into the biological realm. There is no sense that humans can stand outside evolutionary processes and pressures, observing and retaining the mental landscapes of ‘civilization’ (as in the ‘cosy catastrophe’). The human is a biological entity, and as such is as much affected by the changing world as are the lizards or the vegetation. Interestingly Ballard uses the biological ideas of phylogenesis and\n\n20\n\nJ. G. BALLARD\n\nontogenesis (that the development of the human foetus in the womb ‘recapitulates the entire evolutionary past’ (Ballard 1965: 43)) to displace human beings from an assumed place at the top of the evolutionary tree. As Ballard put it in conversation with Brendan Hennessy, ‘I wanted to look at our . . . whole biological inheritance, the fact that we’re all several hundred million years old, as old as the biological kingdoms in our spines, in our brains, in our cellular structure’. Ballard continues, ‘our very identities reflect untold numbers of decisions made to adapt us to change in our environment, decisions lying behind us in the past like some enormous largely forgotten journey (Ballard cited in Hennessy 1971: 164). Ballard’s sf is immersed not only in Freudian depth-psychology but, like the science fiction of H. G. Wells to which he refers, also in a modern evolutionary biology that fatally undermines the idea of human dominion over the Earth. The adaptive determinism of natural selection (the best-adapted species variations survive) feeds the seeming ‘passivity’ of the Ballardian protagonist. Ballard’s protagonists embrace the catastrophe because they accept the logic of evolutionary change. In ‘Myths of the Near Future’, Sheppard tells his companion Anne Godwin: This space-sickness – it’s really about time, not space, like all the Apollo flights. We think of it as a kind of madness, but in fact it may be part of a contingency plan laid down millions of years ago, a real space programme, a chance to escape into a world beyond time . . . Our sense of our own identity, the stream of things going on around us, are an optical illusion. Our eyes are too close together. Those strange temples in the forest, the marvellous birds and animals – you’ve seen them too. We’ve all got to embrace the sun. (Ballard 2001e: 1078)\n\nAs I suggested above, subjectivity itself is bound up with time, and this is what must be discarded to enter the ‘archaic Eden’ of non-time, where ‘“[e]verything that’s ever happened, all the events that will ever happen, are taking place together”’ (Ballard 2001e: 1078). The Ballardian escape from contemporary conditions is less bound to an economic critique of the social, then, than a willed transformation out of consciousness, the conditions of subjectivity, into a state which is at the same time transcendent and profoundly bodily and biological. This is particularly evident in both The Drowned World and in ‘News From the Sun’. In The Drowned World, Kerans refuses to go back to the temperate polar stations which are the last institutional refuge of contemporary ‘civilization’ (and here we must decode this as the contemporary ‘developed’ world), and instead yields to the biological logic of change. At the end of the novel he heads away from the lagoons of London: So he left the lagoon and entered the jungle again, within a few days he was completely lost, following the lagoons southward through the increasing\n\nJ. G. BALLARD’S SHORT FICTION\n\n21\n\nrain and heat, attacked by alligators and giant bats, a second Adam searching for the forgotten paradises of the reborn sun. (Ballard 1965: 171)\n\nIn ‘News from the Sun’, Franklin, who is able to move and to communicate in the fugues, attempts to save the elderly astronaut Trippett at the end of the story and is himself trapped among the solar mirrors of the Soleri II community, awaiting rescue: Franklin waited for her to fetch him, glad that she had learned to feed herself. He knew that he would soon have to leave her and Soleri II, and set off in search of his wife. Happy now to be free of time, he embraced the great fugue. All the light in the universe had come here to greet him, an immense congregation of particles. (Ballard 2001f: 1036)\n\nThe word ‘congregation’ here, and the reference to Adam in The Drowned World, very clearly open the possibility of a quasi-religious reading of these texts: that ‘transcendence’ is a shedding of the material world, a release of the spirit from the body (see Stephenson 1991: 1). (‘Myths of the Near Future’, ‘News from the Sun’ and ‘Memories of the Space Age’ are pervaded by images of flight.) In ‘Myths’ the ending sees a revivified Elaine rather than death, however in The Crystal World to conjoin with the jewelled forest is not to immolate oneself, but to enter a physical realm where material substance achieves full consummation: Above the banks the foliage glowed like painted snow, the only movement coming from the slow traverse of the sun . . . he passed the half-crystallised bodies of men and women fused against the trunks of the trees, looking up at the sun. Most of them were elderly couples seated together with their bodies fusing into one another as they merged with the trees and the jewelled undergrowth. (Ballard 1985a: 163–4)\n\nTransformation, the key to the imagery of the 1960s novels and the short stories, is extended not only to the Ballardian protagonist, but also to landscape, to the physical world itself. In his Introduction to the 2001 The Complete Short Stories, Ballard argues forcefully for the importance of the short story form: ‘Short stories have always been important to me. I like their snapshot quality, their ability to focus intensely on a single subject. They’re also a useful way of trying out the ideas later developed at novel length’ (Ballard 2001b: ix). This process of revisiting, or even rewriting, can be seen most clearly in the relationship between the ‘The Illuminated Man’ (1964), and the novel The Crystal World. Large parts of the story are cannibalized and appear verbatim in the novel, although the setting has been changed (the location of disaster switches from Florida to West Africa) and the characters altered. The fundamental narrative remains intact, however. This constant reworking of images, themes, ideas and narratives has led to Ballard’s work being characterized as ‘obsessional’, but it does at the\n\n22\n\nJ. G. BALLARD\n\nleast provide a remarkable consistency to his body of work. Strangely, his short story writing seems to have come to a halt; his last published collection was War Fever in 1990. Perhaps this can be ascribed to the most mundane of reasons: the availability of publishing outlets. Ballard’s first period of creativity in the short story, publishing consistently between 1957 and 1969, can be connected to his prominence in the Carnell stable of sf magazines and particularly in New Worlds in the 1960s. He had a short story renaissance in the later 1970s when many of his stories appeared in the literary magazine Bananas. The Complete Short Stories collection contains only 17 stories written since 1980, and none since 1992, but his novel writing has continued undimmed. Indeed, since that time, his ‘literary’ reputation has grown in stature considerably. Clute and Nicholls, in the Encyclopaedia of Science Fiction, argue that Ballard has stopped writing sf altogether; certainly, his current fictional interest in the psychopathologies of gated communities, science parks and shopping malls is oriented away from the generic sf and short story forms of which he is an undoubtedly highly skilled, and genuinely original, practitioner.\n\nCHAPTER TWO\n\nDisquieting Features: An Introductory Tour of The Atrocity Exhibition JAKE HUNTLEY\n\nChapter Summary: Focusing on the formal complexities of The Atrocity Exhibition, this chapter considers how one is to proceed with reading this most innovative and elusive text. Huntley explores the influence of Surrealism on Ballard and the impact of the distortion of time on the text. Key words: The Atrocity Exhibition; science fiction; literary experimentation; popular culture; subjectivity; identity; Surrealism; repetition; collage; juxtaposition; temporal and narrative distortion; paratext; reader-response.\n\nChic and hard and gleaming Following a cycle of novels that, on the surface at least, share resemblances with conventional science fiction, J. G. Ballard’s writing shifts into a harsher and more experimental phase in the late 1960s and early 1970s, one that is more grimly apocalyptic than exuberantly speculative. While the counter-culture swirls around him, shaking off recent memories of austerity with psychedelic and psychotropic abandon, Ballard seems to take a more epistemic turn, reappraising his approach and the genre with an apparent dash of optimism: A whole new raft of science fiction writers had come along who had read their Kafka, their James Joyce; they were aware of the larger world of the\n\n24\n\nJ. G. BALLARD twentieth-century experimental novel [. . .] [science fiction] seemed so chic and hard and gleaming, like a brand-new showroom radiator grille. There was a hope that science fiction could take a great leap forward and transform itself into a more sophisticated kind of fiction altogether. (Ballard quoted in Self 1996: 349)\n\nThe transformation in Ballard’s work is indeed sophisticated and the book resulting from the period between 1966–70, The Atrocity Exhibition (1970), is perhaps his most innovative piece of prose, replacing, as Angela Carter once put it, drowned cities, vast desert landscapes and crystallizing jungles with something as ‘jagged as broken glass’ (Carter quoted in Vale 1984: 140). As Ballard explains in the introduction to Crash – that subsequent (and now infamous) novel which grew out of the condensed ‘Crash!’ (1969) chapter – the question of literary invention needs to be comprehensively re-examined: ‘What is the main task of the writer? Can he, any longer, make use of the techniques and perspectives of the traditional 19th century novel, with its linear narrative, its measured chronology, its consular characters grandly inhabiting their domains with ample time and space?’ (1985: 8).\n\nFor Ballard, the answer is emphatic: no, he cannot. And he has no wish to do so. Traditional linear narrative, enervated, exhausted and redundant, is almost the wrong medium entirely in which to be operating. Ballard’s response, after all, is a celebration of the brand-new radiator grille as it is subjected to Warholian repetition, examined from epochal distance and in forensic detail, presented at its most defamiliarized and abstracted. Radical, explicit and experimental, The Atrocity Exhibition is a jarring montage of jump-cut prose – narrative rather than novelistic, convoluted by repetitive free-association – which is probably more accessible to an audience familiar with frenetic, unrelenting modern media than to the text’s contemporary readership, whose nearest touchstones might have been Luis Buñuel’s Un Chien Andalu (1929), Maya Deren’s Meshes of the Afternoon (1943), or Alain Reisner’s Last Year in Marienbad (1961). Rather than displaying ‘ample time and space’, The Atrocity Exhibition is constructed from blocks of hard, gleaming prose assembled into 15 chapters that are concentrated, condensed and compressed, randomized bursts triggered from a faulty space–time continuum, so that they read more like the field notes for some wayward medical research than a novel. Moreover, on a quotidian note, Ballard offers a caveat: ‘You’ve got to remember that the individual pieces that make up The Atrocity Exhibition were written independently – virtually as short stories – and published independently, all of them in various magazines. So a certain element of inconsistency crept in’ (Ballard quoted in Vale 2005: 258). It is, consequently, a text that both resists and entices readerly response, frustrating exposition and scuttling\n\nTOUR OF THE ATROCITY EXHIBITION\n\n25\n\nsummarizing inclinations as it exhibits a psychologically-inflected landscape where conflicting media exist simultaneously and characters are reduced to mere pools of identity, as precarious as mercury.\n\nAnother face The Atrocity Exhibition presents a markedly fraught, harried or jeopardized version of sundered subjectivity. The central figure of The Atrocity Exhibition, variously named Traven, Travers, Talbot, Talbert and Travis, is the most acute expression of the slippage of identity that occurs throughout the text. Just as the naming process hovers around a small, closed linguistic circuit without settling definitively, so the restless figure of the doctor-patient traverses a series of repeated, reworked backdrops, urgently attempting to establish the conditions under which he intends to ‘“revolt against the present continuum of time and space”’ (Ballard 1990: 12) and destroy the ‘“imbalance of an asymmetric world”’ (Ballard 1990: 14) – in short, to declare World War III on the psychological plane. At least, this is Dr Nathan’s initial diagnosis. Latterly – alternately – Nathan refines his case notes: ‘“What the patient is reacting against is, simply, the phenomenology of the universe, the specific and independent existence of separate objects and events”’ (Ballard 1990: 34). As if faced with a galloping pathology, Nathan ultimately reassesses the patient, suggesting Travis is also trying to use car crash scenarios, psychological responses to ‘atrocity’ and the ‘alternate’ assassination of President Kennedy to somehow save the victims of the Apollo disaster: ‘“Trabert will try to reintegrate space and so liberate the three men in the capsule. For him they still wait there on their contour couches”’ (Ballard 1990: 48). Perhaps the fullest view of the Travis diagram is that presented retrospectively, by Captain Webster, who explains the aftermath of a crashed landing: “He was alive when they got him out, but at one point in the operating theatre his heart and vital functions failed. In the technical sense he was dead for about two minutes. Now, all this time later, it looks as if something is missing, something that vanished during the short period of his death. Perhaps his soul, the capacity to achieve a state of grace. Nathan would call it the ability to accept the phenomenology of the universe, or the fact of your own consciousness. This is Traven’s hell. You can see he’s trying to build bridges between things – this Kennedy business, for example. He wants to kill Kennedy again, but in a way that makes sense.” (Ballard 1990: 36)\n\nTravis’s instability is perpetual, somehow existing within the tension of irreconcilable contradiction: ‘“was my husband a doctor, or a patient?”’ (Ballard 1990: 12) asks Margaret Travis. Instead, Travis, collectively, is trapped in a temporal suture, a 2-minute stitch in time. He is caught in a compulsive process of change and transformation that has no\n\n26\n\nJ. G. BALLARD\n\npurposeful end-point and cannot be resolved in a way that makes sense. This leaves him flickering through the passages in a series of ghostly afterimages, more an entropic sloughing of selfhood than a diagrammatic projection. In the latter stages of the text he seems to fade out, or perhaps diffuse, entirely. There only remain the chrysalis husks, exhausted and abandoned at the end of each chapter, from which the subsequent instalment of Travis has emerged. In an alternative reading, Roger Luckhurst refers to Travis as the ‘T-Cell’, suggesting that he acts as a contagion, multiple in the manner of bacilli, which infects the narrative (1997: 86). If this is the case, then his peripatetic nature is strategically vital in inaugurating World War III, revolting against time and reintegrating space, his movements carrying instability until it reaches pandemic proportions. Travis’s hell then becomes other people’s.\n\nVariously aligned conscripts Sundry characters are drawn into the orbit of Travis’s plans. Some, such as the pilot with inchoate features, the woman with radiation burns (‘couriers from his own unconscious?’ (Ballard 1990: 11)) and the ‘Watching Trinity’ (Ballard 1990: 45) of Kline, Coma and Xero, are strange, haunting presences, externalized symptoms of Travis’s psychopathology who seem to drift through the empty car parks, corridors and desert spaces in his wake. In his marginalia for the Re/Search edition of The Atrocity Exhibition), Ballard calls the latter trio ‘shadows projected from Traven’s unconscious’ (Ballard 1990: 32), rather as if they were negatives to his luminescent positive. It is part of the palimpsestic operation of the text that these figures are as present as some of the staff of the unnamed clinic such as Dr Nathan and Dr Catherine Austin; shadows apparently as substantial as the people casting them. Certainly, on a textual level, the reliance on impersonal pronouns heightens this effect: it is quite impossible, at times, to decide which ‘he’ is looking at which ‘she’. This flattening of independent, autonomous identity can also be seen in the way (pre-empting Crash), Nathan, Austin, Webster and Karen Novotny are all presented at points in the text as mannequins or posed figures, and are nearly all subject to repeated, ‘conceptual’ deaths: ‘Once again Karen Novotny had died, Talbert’s fears and obsessions mimetized in her alternate death’ (Ballard 1990: 57). Unwilling performers in Travis’s strategic manoeuvres, they are frequently ‘staged’ in ways that contradict linear narrative, and their lines intersect not only with each other but with alternate versions of themselves. Thus, an effect may be concurrent with, or even precede, its cause, and a character’s death may not be their telos: Novotny, for example, is confronted with adverts and other reminders of the film depicting her ‘sex-death’; Dr Nathan, Webster and Austin all ‘die’ in the first chapter, the trinity of corpses creating ‘a small tableau by the bunkers’ (Ballard 1990: 17). In Travis’s attempts\n\nTOUR OF THE ATROCITY EXHIBITION\n\n27\n\nto overhaul time and space, lifelines become hopelessly tangled, their ‘real’ presence may be overlaid with images generated anywhere from deep spinal memories to posthumous synaptic bursts. These interactions throughout The Atrocity Exhibition may be tricky to follow, tangling and looping, binding and bordering. The effect is an interwoven structure, or surface, where ‘lines’ (characters, events) may cross, meet in opposite directions or become folded. Frequently related to inanimate artefacts, the characters come to stand as a sort of ‘furniture’ of the exhibition and, as such, could be treated as analogues with the mysterious collection left by Travis for Dr Nathan to solve: He peered at the objects on the tray offered to him by the nurse. ‘So, these are the treasures he has left us – an entry from Oswald’s Historic Diary, a much-thumbed reproduction of Magritte’s ‘Annunciation,’ and the mass numbers of the first twelve radioactive nuclides. ‘What are we supposed to do with them?’ Nurse Nagamatzu gazed at him with cool eyes. ‘Permutate them, doctor?’ (Ballard 1990: 31)\n\nAs the ramifications of Travis’ assault on the space–time continuum become apparent, these characters are patched throughout the chapters, caught within the shuffling structure and subject to the exhibition’s recursive properties. The ‘correct’ angle from which to see these figures is unclear – the perspective is equivocal, the focal point somehow askew. Rather, in the manner of the clinic’s annual exhibition of patient’s paintings where it is uncertain whether the art or the artists are the true subject of the display, the line appears indiscernible, the margin of a mirage.\n\nExploded view – astronomical perspective Elsewhere, Ballard’s dismantling of identity is more explicit – and prosaic. Karen Novotny is bluntly reconfigured as simply a quantifiable set of sensory stimuli: ‘“In a sense,” Dr Nathan explained to Koester, “one may regard this as a kit, which Talbert has devised, entitled ‘Karen Novotny’ – it might even be feasible to market it commercially”’ (Ballard 1990: 54). The 16 items, ranging from manufactured body parts to medical notes, swabs and speech samples, create ‘“an adequate picture of a woman, who could easily be reconstituted from it”’ (Ballard 1990: 54). Recalling the Surrealist automata of Hans Bellmer (a surrealist figure who also repeats throughout the text), ‘Karen Novotny’ is brought to life through an arrangement of inanimate pieces, the scattered data accumulating to manufacture a perverse Golem. This mechanical reproduction is an example of the ‘liberation of sexual and machine libido’ (Ballard 1990: 99) that rebounds throughout the text. In the Re/Search edition, directly opposite ‘The Sex Kit’ is one of a series of ‘medical illustrations’ by Phoebe Gloeckner, a cross sectioned\n\n28\n\nJ. G. BALLARD\n\nimage of oral sex that bears some relation to the text (Ballard 1990: 55). The picture is labelled (glans being ‘a’), although the ‘key’ is missing and one of the inserts corresponds to the ‘“nipple marked by a small ulcer”’ (Ballard 1990: 54) mentioned in the kit. Only with the illustration of an appendix (to accompany the four additional chapters, naturally enough) (Ballard 1990: 110) do the text and illustrations achieve full synchronicity, albeit on the level of a visual pun. Most of the anonymized pictures of dissociated body parts seem to be in arbitrary collision with the text or, in a more appropriate formulation, these visual interpolations are flung viscera, evidence of the explosive propensities of the text. The body, just as much as identity, is liable to be enrolled in this particular theatre of conflict. It is not just Karen Novotny who is left in pieces. In a bid to draw Travis out or distract his plans, Dr Nathan arranges for a series of photographs of Margaret, Travis’s wife, to cover the numerous billboards furnishing The Atrocity Exhibition, casting her as casus belli and neutralising agent. These vast displays of photographically enlarged body parts, ‘“an immensely magnified portion of the skin over the iliac crest [. . .] a segment of lower lip, a right nostril, a portion of female perineum”’ (Ballard 1990: 15) are pasted across 500 billboards screening off the hospital so that Margaret Travis’s fragmented form comes to contain and shield the entire building, the architecture ‘housed’ within her body. Yet the images of Margaret Travis are so radically distanced from the ‘reality’ of the woman that it requires a helicopter pilot to supervise the operation, much as the Gloeckner illustrations featuring isolated body parts or cellular views become abstracted and mysterious Billboards characterize the landscape, displaying depersonalized body parts for spectators and creating connections across strata or pathways for those touring The Atrocity Exhibition. Despite the extreme realignments that occur, some figures retain a coherence or integrity unachievable by others: ‘“the multiplied body of the film actress [becomes] one of the few valid landscapes of our age’” (Ballard 1990: 56). Celebrity proves the most resilient of connective tissue, allowing Elizabeth Taylor, Marilyn Monroe, Ronald Regan, John F. and Jackie Kennedy to endure the fractures, distortions and compressions of the text. The famous maintain a persistence of vision, stabilized in a way that cannot be imitated, casting them as fixed points within the kaleidoscope and allowing everyone else to navigate by the stars.\n\nLittle psychological machines In conversation with Graeme Revell, Ballard states: In a sense, I’m assembling the materials of an autopsy, and I’m treating reality – the reality we inhabit – almost as if it were a cadaver, or, let’s say, the\n\nTOUR OF THE ATROCITY EXHIBITION\n\n29\n\ncontents of a special kind of forensic inquisition. We have these objects here – what are they"
