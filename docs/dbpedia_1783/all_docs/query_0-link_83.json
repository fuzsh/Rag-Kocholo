        "text": "The series is featuring occasional works of fiction. This is one.\n\n~~~\n\nSome years ago my husband and I rented an apartment in Paris to celebrate our twentieth anniversary. On the morning of the afternoon we were to leave I packed, putting our clothes and books into two suitcases. I stashed our money and other documents in a leather wallet with many compartments, some hidden within others. I dropped this clever wallet into a quilted backpack. Then, wearing the backpack, I went out for a last stroll on the Boulevard Saint Michel. There, at a kiosk, I bought a lacey shawl for my adored aunt and some oversized hoops for my ears. I came back. I threw the backpack on the bed. And discovered that the clever wallet and its contents, including, God help us, our passports, were gone.\n\nI peeked into the living room at the kindly man I’d married, who was patiently making his way through Le Monde. Was the kindly man to end the vacation, not to mention the marriage, by strangling me? Leaving the backpack on the bed I ran back to the kiosk where I had bought the lacey shawl for my accursed aunt and the hoop earrings for my ridiculous self. I’d paid with money from the clever wallet – I’d had it then. I begged the proprietor to return it. He retorted that he didn’t have it. “Those gypsies,” he shrugged. “Perhaps this is yours,” handing me a red scarf. I tied it around my head, knotting it at the nape. Perhaps this disguise would encourage the gypsy band to accept me as one of their own, and I could filch my clever wallet from them. I retraced my steps to the apartment, my eyes on the sidewalk. No clever wallet. No gypsies either.\n\n“Oh, dear,” murmured the probable strangler when I told him my – our – plight. A moment earlier I’d thought I couldn’t feel worse. His kindness was my undoing, and I burst into tears which for the next several hours I never quite burst out of.\n\nWe picked up our suitcases and locked the door, gave the key to the concierge, and boarded the RER to the airport. There we threw ourselves on the kindness of Air France. Its representative at the ticket counter broomed us towards an executive, her specialty tourists in trouble. She led us into a small windowless room and went through what probably is the usual procedure with people like us – calm husband, hysterical wife with Carmen delusions. She called the United States State Department and got connected to the proper authority. Authority said that if these people can identify themselves – if their answers to certain questions match the answers a pair named Pearlman supplied when applying for passports – you can let them go.\n\nAnswer questions? There was the little problem of my larynx, drenched in tears. There was the problem of my total body tremor. My husband, noting these things, gallantly went first. The questions seemed to be, judging from his answers, Date of birth, Mother’s maiden name, Father’s place of birth. He handed the telephone to me.\n\nWhat is your date of birth, said Authority. I told her. “I know it’s hard to believe,” I said, smiling winsomely into the receiver. “But, honestly, I have not had work done. Well, maybe a little eyelid tweak …”.\n\nWhat was your mother’s maiden name?\n\n“Estelle. Though everybody called her …”\n\nSurname.\n\nI told her, this time without embellishment.\n\nAnd where was your father born?\n\nWe seemed to be one word away from liberty.\n\n“He was born in ….” I faltered.\n\n“He was born in ….” I attempted.\n\n“He was at born at home,” I managed. “Most people were in those days. On a bed with a straw mattress.”\n\nAnd where was home.\n\n“A shtetl.”\n\nAnd where was the shtetl?\n\n“Outside a small town called Zashkiev. My aunt – not the one I bought the lace for, another one — loved to reminisce about the peasants marching home from the fields in the early evening, singing.”\n\nHow lovely. And Zashkiev was where? wondered Authority.\n\n“Where my father was born, I told you!”\n\nYes. And its country?\n\n“Oh, Russia,” I said in an offhand voice. “My father was born in Russia. He was … He was … “\n\nI paused. I had just recalled that my father was Nicholas II. I remembered that I was his sole surviving offspring. I could if I were so inclined claim the treasure supposedly residing in a French Bank; I could claim the crown now under glass in Moscow; I could claim all those eggs Fabergé made for my family. All I had to do was say to Authority: He was the Tsar.\n\nBut mention of my royal blood would probably make my husband anxious. He was looking anxious already. So I wound up with a modest statement: “He was Russian.”\n\nOur baggage was hustled off in one direction and we in another. “Where …” I began. “Shut up,” said my husband, for the first time in our marriage. We were escorted onto the waiting plane – it had been kept at the gate for us — and faced two hundred disgruntled passengers. I was still wearing headscarf and earrings, and I had draped my aunt’s lace shawl over my shoulders to complete the ensemble. A voice on the loudspeaker said “We are sorry for the delay,” in two languages, neither of them Russian. A stewardess escorted us delicately to our seats as if we were indeed royalty, or maybe a graduate of Charenton and her physician. Even before take-off that same stewardess slipped me a tot of something, which she rightly divined I could use.\n\nEdith Pearlman is the author of four collections of short stories, including, most recently, “Binocular Vision,” which won the 2011 National Book Critics Circle Award and the Boston Authors’ Club Award. She also received the 2011 PEN/Malamud award for excellence in short fiction."
