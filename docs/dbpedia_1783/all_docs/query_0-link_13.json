        "text": "BIRTH\n\nFLORENCE AMELIA GROSE was born on Tuesday 13th November 1855 in Rushen, Isle of Man (most likely at Ballacorkish) and baptised on Wednesday 28th November 1855 at Kirk Rushen.\n\nFlorence was the youngest daughter of Mine Captain, Matthew Grose junior (1819-1887) and his first wife, Annie Weston Grose (nee Read) (1818-1868). Matthew Grose did have other daughters with his second wife, Elizabeth (nee Qualtrough/Luff), but Florence was the youngest daughter with Annie.\n\nCHILDHOOD\n\nAt the age of five, Florence appeared on the 1861 census, living at Ballacorkish, Rushen with her parents and siblings.\n\nHer father, Matthew Grose was listed as “Lead & Copper Mine Agent” and mother, Annie, an “Agents wife”.\n\nThere were also Florence’s siblings, Matthew John (age 17), Emma (age 15), Walter Henry (age 14), Francis (age 8), Clara (age 6), Albert (age 3) and Horace (9 months). Her brother Alfred Matthew has not yet been found on the 1861 census.\n\nIn May 1868, when Florence was 12 years old, her mother, Annie, passed away. On 22nd September of the same year, her father, Matthew Grose remarried, a Butler’s widow, Mrs Elizabeth Luff (nee Qualtrough) at Bishopscourt. On the 12th October 1868, two of Florence’s older brothers (Matthew John and Alfred Matthew) were sentenced to two months hard labour for grand larceny (theft) of apples and peaches.\n\nOn the 1871 census, Florence was living on Ballakilpatrick Road (more commonly known by the Manx version Ballakilpheric -thanks Robert and Catherine!) as a fourteen year old scholar with her father, Matthew Grose, step-mother, Elizabeth and siblings, Matthew, Clara, Francis, Albert, Horace and half-sister, Beatrice.\n\nA YOUNG WOMAN\n\nBy October 1879, Florence was 23 years old and working as a domestic servant.\n\nOn Wednesday 21st October 1879, she appeared at the Court of Criminal Inquiry, before His Honour, Deemster Drinkwater, charged with stealing wearing apparel – a cloth jacket, pair of gloves and other articles from 21 year old, Emily Mona Clegg (Clague), who resided with her parents at 9 Christian Road in Douglas.\n\nDeemster William Leece Drinkwater is remembered as a judge whose record was..:\n\n“…one of which any man would have had good reason to be proud. His profound knowledge of both English and Manx law, his common sense and his impeccable impartiality made him almost the perfect judge.”\n\nThe Manx Sun newspaper reported Florence’s court case on Saturday 25th October 1879 in a section called ROBBERIES BY SERVANTS (there were many that week – perhaps a common occurrence). Florence Grose pleaded guilty to the charges and was sentenced to three months imprisonment with hard labour in Castle Rushen gaol.\n\nIMPRISONED\n\nUpon her incarceration she was unwell for many weeks\n\n“We who live in prison, and in whose lives there is no event but sorrow, have to measure time by throbs of pain, and the record of bitter moments.”\n\nOscar Wilde\n\nIn 1879, Castle Rushen Gaol was no place for a young, sick woman.\n\nThe gov.im website describes how\n\n“Unless prisoners were too ill they were expected to work and produce a set amount each day. Goods produced included mats, matting and scrubbers, stone breaking and oakum picking (picking out fibres from old rope so they could be re-used).”\n\nOn 26th February 1879, a writer reported on Castle Rushen Gaol and Manx Police in the Mona’s Herald newspaper …\n\n“It is said there is even a time when the cat takes compassion on the captured mouse, but the law or its officers seem insensible to mercy.”\n\nand continued…\n\n“How little the world cares for the unfortunate waifs and strays.”\n\nIn 1900, “History of IOM” described how prior to 1891…\n\n“The only prison was the old Castle Rushen, where it was impossible to adopt the system of solitary confinement in its full extent; and, indeed, it had been palpable for many years past, that the state of things existing there was, from the point of view both of humanity and of the maintenance of proper prison discipline, intolerable.”\n\nDEATH\n\n24 year old Florence Amelia Grose died in Castle Rushen Gaol on Tuesday 16th December 1879.\n\nAn inquest was held the following day and the outcome was described in the newspaper on Saturday 20th December 1879.\n\nDEATH IN THE GAOL.—On Tuesday last one of the prisoners, a young woman, died in the Gaol of Castle Rushen. An inquest was held on Wednesday, and from the evidence given it appeared that she had been in a weak state of health when lodged in gaol, and had received constant medical attendance and proper care. A verdict of \"Death from natural causes\" was returned.\n\nDeath from natural causes? Would Florence and others have died if they hadn’t been incarcerated in a prison with INTOLERABLE conditions and gaolers “INSENSIBLE to mercy”?\n\nAn article in the Isle of Man Times, the following February questioned the conditions in the Gaol.\n\nIt would be satisfactory to know what are the sanitary arrangements of Castle Rushen Gaol and tbe military barracks at Castletown, for although tbe more direct and palpable effects of overcrowding and deficient ventilation may be unrecognisable, there are certain other conditions, perhaps equally grave though not so well pronounced, which should not be overlooked.\n\nThe gov.im website describes how…\n\nBy the 1880s it was obvious that Castle Rushen was not adequate to house in good conditions the number of prisoners in custody. There was no possibility of separating prisoners and it was very hard to keep order. The first inspection by the chairman of the Commissioners for Prisons in England and Wales took place in 1885. His report recommended that a new prison should be built.\n\nFlorence Amelia Grose was buried at Rushen on Thursday 18th December 1879.\n\n“Physical ills are the taxes laid upon this wretched life; some are taxed higher, and some lower, but all pay something.” – Lord Chesterfield\n\nThis post will look at the ancient parish church of St Runius in Marown, Isle of Man… and an interesting grave marker for members of the Grose family in the churchyard there.\n\nIn the previous post we looked for the graves of the Mining Engineer, Matthew Grose junior (1819-1887) & his second wife, Elizabeth nee Qualtrough (1835-1918), both buried at Kirk Christ, Rushen, Isle of Man.\n\nSome questions remain…\n\nWhere is his first wife (Anne Grose nee Read, 1818-1868) buried?\n\nWhere is his father (Matthew Grose senior, 1788-1849) buried?\n\nPhoto © Phil Catterall (cc-by-sa/2.0)\n\n…\n\nSketch of 1834.

Old St Runius continued to be used occasionally for special services.\n\nFrom the Isle of Man Guide website\n\n…\n\nAccording to a note by the late Professor Sir John Rhys, in “Mannin” (No. 2) :” the Parish Church of Marown, spelled variously Marown, Maronne, and Maroon. Skeeley Maroon is dedicated to a Saint called Maronog, in the Irish Calendar; and in the Scottish Calendar, Ronan.”\n\nIn the Manx Doomsday Book, or Manorial Rent Roll, of 1511, A.D. , the parish is styled St. Runii—St. Runy was evidently one of the Columban missionaries who came to the Isle of Man probably about the 7th Century, and it is in the Old Churchyard of Marown where his remains, with those of St. Lomanus and St. Onca are supposed to be buried, ” and these for ever lie un-molested.”\n\nFrom A Manx Note Book\n\n…\n\nWhy was a new church built?\n\nWith the improvement of the Douglas/Peel main road in the early 19th Century population growth focused on Crosby and the old church became too small and too far from the congregation.\n\nIn 1844 Phillip Killey, owner of a brewery in Douglas, gave land from his estate adjoining the main road between Crosby and Glen Vine for a new Church.\n\nTynwald approved the scheme in 1847, the foundation stone was laid by Bishop Auckland in 1849 and the Church consecrated in 1859.\n\nFrom A Manx Note Book\n\n…\n\nMany years later on the 5th Oct., 1924, A.E. CLARKE wrote about this event at Marown Vicarage…\n\nNeedless to say that , this gift was accepted. and in a few years time from this date, the Old Church, so far as public worship was concerned, was forsaken for the new.\n\nIt was not so, however, with regard to burials.\n\nThe people of Marown still clung tenaciously to the old ground, where the remains of their forefathers lay for generations.\n\n…\n\nPhoto of Marown Old Church courtesy of Andy Stephenson [CC BY-SA 2.0], via Wikimedia Commons\n\n…\n\nThe ‘Grose’ Obelisk:\n\nIn the churchyard of St Runius, Marown, Isle of Man there is a granite obelisk and two fallen headstones surrounded by railings. The granite is possibly from ‘the fine granite quarry’ that the Grose family opened at Foxdale.\n\nPhoto © Robert Cannell\n\n…\n\nOver the years there have been discussions (and confusion!) about the individuals buried there.\n\nBy studying a combination of hard-to-read memorial inscriptions and incomplete burial records, this is our best interpretation of the burials. If any further information comes to light, then it will be corrected and shared on the blog.\n\nPhoto © Richard Hoare (cc-by-sa/2.0)\n\n…\n\nWho is buried there?\n\nThe Grose family used St Runius as their main local church for baptising, marrying and burying for many years. There was a track from their home at Cornelly/Jones Mine (part of Foxdale Mines) to the church. Other churches were used too (eg, Patrick), but there is a lot of activity at St Runius.\n\nIt is likely that three generations of the Grose family are buried at St Runius, Marown… Matthew Grose senior (1788-1849) with both of his wives, his daughter-in-law and perhaps five of his grandchildren.\n\nThe first ‘Grose’ burial was likely Matthew Grose senior’s first wife, Mary Grose (nee Wearn) buried 1839. She doesn’t appear in the burial records, but the inscription on the headstone (see section below) and newspaper obituary indicates this.\n\nManks Advertiser, Tuesday, January 08, 1839; Page: 3 (Via iMusuem)\n\n…\n\nAn infant, John Grose, was buried in Marown in 1845. This is likely, John Matthew Grose the son of John Grose and Charlotte (nee Clucas).\n\nVia iMuseum\n\n…\n\nMatthew Grose senior was buried in 1849\n\nManx Liberal, Saturday, June 23, 1849; Page: 3\n\n(Via iMusuem)\n\n…\n\nFrederick William Grose (Matthew junior’s son) buried 1858\n\nMona’s Herald, Wednesday, June 16, 1858; Page: 3\n\n(Via iMusuem)\n\n…\n\nMatthew Grose senior’s second wife Mary Grose (nee Tregonning) buried 1864\n\nMona’s Herald, Wednesday, November 23, 1864; Page: 3\n\n(Via iMusuem)\n\n…\n\nMatthew Grose junior’s wife, Anne Weston Grose (nee Read) was buried 1868\n\nMona’s Herald, Wednesday, May 13, 1868; Page: 7\n\n(Via iMusuem)\n\n…\n\nFrom Isle of Man, Burial Index, 1598-2003 via Ancestry UK\n\n…\n\nAdditionally, 3 children of Matthew senior’s daughter, Jane Powning (nee Grose) are buried at Marown.\n\nFrom Isle of Man, Burial Index, 1598-2003 via Ancestry UK\n\n…\n\nIn the Press…\n\nThe ‘Grose’ obelisk at Marown has been written about in the newspapers…\n\nFrom the Isle of Man Weekly Times (1 Oct 1932)…\n\nComparatively few of the gravestones in Marown are used to point the moral of the shortness of life at its longest and the possible suddenness of death.\n\nCaptain Matthew Grose [junior] of the Ballacorkish mine, Rushen, erected a monument to his son [Frederick] in the form of an obelisk, bearing on its four sides the words,\n\nTime, how short!\n\nEternity, how long!\n\nLife, how uncertain!\n\nDeath, how sure!\n\nhttp://www.isle-of-man.com/manxnotebook/gazateer/gyards/mn.htm\n\n…\n\nAnalysing the Memorial inscriptions:\n\nThere are inscriptions on the fallen stones and obelisk.\n\nFrom a long discussion on a Manx genealogy forum (from 2006) we can see the following incomplete inscriptions were recorded…\n\nhttp://www.isle-of-man.com/genealogy/messageboard/index.pl/md/read/id/509238\n\nIn memory of Ann Mary Grose the beloved wife of Capt Matthew Grose …………….mines…………..January 8th 1839\n\nWeep not for me my ………..\n\nMy children dear my ……………\n\nPrepare yourselves………\n\nalso the above named capt Matthew Grose who died on the 19th Jun 1848 1849 aged 62 years\n\nThanks to Rob Cannell for cleaning the headstone, so the ‘Ann’ above could be corrected to ‘Mary’ which corresponds to Mary Grose (nee Wearn).\n\n…\n\nIn memory of Frederick William son of Capt Matthew Grose [junior] and Ann Weston his wife of Ballacorkish Parish of Rushen\n\nBorn March 15th 1850 died June 2nd 1858\n\n…\n\nConclusion:\n\nConfusion reigned for a long time because there was an 1839 obituary for a Mary Grose, but it seemed her burial was recorded in 1864. Turns out they were both right – they’re two different people! Both wives of Matthew Grose senior and both called Mary!\n\nAdd to the mix a memorial inscription from 1839 transcribed as Ann Grose instead of Mary Grose! Then it turns out that there are actually two Mary Groses… and an Anne Grose buried there too! Anne being a wife of a Captain Matthew Grose too… no not that one – his son!\n\nWe got there in the end (hopefully!). It’s a reminder to check as many sources as possible and see the originals, not transcriptions where possible.\n\nOriginally erected by the mining engineer, Matthew Grose junior, mourning his young son Frederick, the granite obelisk is a fine monument to the generations of the Grose family buried at St Runius, Marown and elsewhere on the Isle of Man.\n\nMatthew Grose junior may now be in an unmarked grave at Rushen, but the monument he created for others in his family has stood for almost 160 years.\n\n…\n\nThanks and Further Reading:\n\nI must thank Rob Cannell for providing plenty of information and some of the great photos for this post. Also for cleaning up that headstone!\n\nA Manx Note Book\n\nEllan Vannin Volume 1\n\nIOM Photography\n\nIsle of Man Guide\n\nThe Younger Sister:\n\nChristian Grose (1773-?) was the younger sister of Cornish Mine Captains, Matthew Grose (1761-1824) and Samuel Grose (1764-1825).\n\nHer brothers worked at mines in Somerset and Cornwall and have already been written about on the ‘Adventurous Ancestors’ blog here and (in more detail) here.\n\nChristian Grose was baptised at St. Uny in Redruth, Cornwall on 12th April 1773 to parents Matthew Grose and his wife Mary (nee Davey).\n\nAt the age of nineteen, Christian Grose married Richard Angove (1772-) on 15th October 1792 at St. Uny, Redruth. Both were likely illiterate as they marked (did not sign) the marriage register. The witnesses of their marriage were John Angove and Benjamin Davey (likely relatives of the bride and groom).\n\nInteresting that, (unlike Christian Grose), her brothers had been educated as both signed their marriage registers, (Matthew in 1783 and Samuel in 1786).\n\nAfter marriage, Christian (nee Grose) and Richard Angove encountered drama and troubles in 1795. I contacted their descendant, Peter Gardner, about the incidents I’d read about in his fantastic essay “A Convict in the Family”:\n\nPeter commented that Christian and Richard Angove were…\n\n“Desperate people in desperate times.”\n\nThis moving and meaningful interpretation inspired me to share their story here (mainly extracts from Peter’s essay and other sources).\n\n1795 certainly epitomised “desperate people in desperate times”. It was the year of bread riots across England – wheat shortages meant starving people and a country on the brink of famine.\n\n…\n\nThe Angoves of Plain-an-Gwarry:\n\nRichard Angove was baptised in Redruth, Cornwall on 22nd March 1772 to parents John Angove and his wife Elizabeth (nee Launder).\n\nRichard Angove (1772-?) and his ancestors hailed from Plain-an-Gwarry, near Redruth\n\n“Plain-an-Gwarry (Cornish: Plen an Gwari) is a hamlet in the west of Redruth, Cornwall… It is entirely surrounded by the town of Redruth… The name derives from Cornish plen an gwari (meaning “playing place”), an open-air performance area used historically for entertainment and instruction.”\n\nvia Plain-an-Gwarry – Wikipedia\n\nIn this case, Plain-an-Gwarry is a residential hamlet, but elsewhere in Cornwall the term refers more generically to an outdoor entertainment space…\n\nA plen-an-gwary, also known as a playing place or round (Cornish: Plen an Gwari), is a medieval Cornish amphitheatre. A circular outdoor space used for plays, sports, and public events, the plen-an-gwary was a Cornish variant of a construction style found across Great Britain. Formerly common across Cornwall, only two survive nearly complete today…\n\nThe theatre area could be used for local gatherings, sports events, and production of plays. Cornwall culture had a type of play called miracle plays, written in the Cornish language, that would were meant to spread Christianity. To capture the attention of the audience, “the plays were often noisy, bawdy and entertaining.”\n\nvia Plen-an-gwary – Wikipedia\n\nPeter Gardner writes about Plain-an-Gwarry in his essay:\n\n“Plain An Gwarry was built early in the Eighteenth Century to house miners for the nearby North Downs tin and copper mines. The conditions in this and other similar villages by today’s standards were appalling. In 1833 when Plain An Gwarry was over 100 years old it was reported that there were just 11 privies for over 130 dwellings. These houses were overcrowded with large, extended families and lodgers being taken in to supplement incomes. Streets were given names like Dirty Court and Poverty Court.”\n\n…\n\nChristian’s ‘ill-behaved husband’:\n\nMining Consultant, William Jenkin wrote a letter to Samuel Grose (Christian’s ‘Mine Captain’ brother) on 21st March 1795 which mentions Christian and other relations:\n\nThy Aunt Kate has behaved unkind to the little Alice Richards whom I have this day fixed with thy Uncle Richard Nicholls of Michell -who has taken her home with him and promised to take good care of her, and I believe he will do so. I am pleased with him from the little I have seen of him. Little Mary still lies on hands – but as she seems a well behaved industrious girl, and is in constant employ, I hope she will not stand in need of much assistance.\n\nAll these family members require further research. The letter continues about Christian…\n\nThy sister Kitty [Christian] and her ill-behaved Husband [Richard Angove] vexed me much one day this week by laying wait at thy Father’s door in the morning, and as the little girl opened it, they rushed in and seized the bed and bolster which he lay on while he lived, and carried it away, and then brought back an old bed of theirs in it’s stead. The little Girl [Mary] came up to me in a great surprise to tell me of it. I immediately went down, and by threatening them got back the Bed and bolster again–and I think it will be well, if I don’t hear from thee soon, to take all the goods to my House\n\nVia ‘News From Cornwall’, by A.K. Hamiliton Jenkin\n\n…\n\nSevere Whipping:\n\nAnother letter followed from William Jenkin to Samuel Grose, on 16th October 1795\n\nA strong rumour prevailed here yesterday that Kitty’s [Christian’s] husband [Richard Angove] was dead, and that Dug [Launder – a relative] was dying – and the Hill [A poor quarter of Redruth, near Plain-an-Gwarry] was in an uproar. It was asserted that their death was owing to the severe whipping they had last week. But on enquiry today I find it was a false report. I believe they had a pretty close trimming. I am sorry for thy sister [Christian] who I understand is far gone with child, and must unavoidably suffer by her husband’s misbehaviour.\n\nVia ‘News From Cornwall’, by A.K. Hamiliton Jenkin\n\nPeter Gardner writes more about this event in his essay :\n\nIn 1795 Richard Angove… was sentenced, with a relative, to 2 years in Bodmin prison for the theft of 4 pence worth of tin ore. His young wife Christian (nee Grose) was pregnant.\n\nWendy Angove in her history of the Angove family wrote:\n\n“William Launder of Redruth, tinner, and Richard Angove of Redruth, tinner, were convicted of taking 20lbs of ore, value 2d, 20lbs of tin stuff, value 2d, the property of Sir John St Aubyn and others, adventurers of Wheal Peevor. Sentenced to hard labour for 2 years, and to be publicly whipped until their backs are bloody, in Bodmin, at the beginning and end of their punishment.” [Angove, Wendy. The Jigsaw Puzzle Tree, The Author, Brigend Wales, 2003 p.78]\n\nThis was an extremely severe punishment in troubled times. Launder and Angove were either cousins or uncle and nephew and appear to have been ‘tributers’ (contract miners) in Wheel Peevor.\n\nAn estimate of the theft in today’s values (2015) is difficult and the 4d could have been as low as $40. Estimates of earnings of tributers about this time averaged from £2 to £3 per month so 4d would equal at least 1/120th of a monthly wage. However if their pitch (contracted area of the mine) turned poor or they had a poor contract they may have earned very little or nothing. Some prices of foodstuffs about this time (1801) included butter at 8d per pound, bacon 8d per pound and barley 6s bushel.\n\nThe crime almost certainly was one of ‘kitting’ – taking ore from another part of the mine away from their own ‘pitch’ or designated place and presenting it at as their own. This practice was generally frowned upon by miners and definitely so if the ore was stolen from another group of tributers’ pitch – in other words stealing from mates. However in this instance it appears that the ore was removed from a part of the mine not being worked by their fellows – in other words they were stealing from the company.\n\nThis and the harshness of the punishment meant they had strong support amongst the community\n\nPeter also writes insightfully about the riot:\n\nThe riot that followed this cruel punishment was typical Cornish behaviour to injustice and in desperate times. It followed on from food riots in Redruth at the market earlier in the year. From this behaviour we can conclude that those being punished had the support of the community and that the spirit of revolt was very strong.\n\n…\n\nChildren of Christian (nee Grose) and Richard Angove:\n\nOn 6th October, 1793, a daughter, Alice Angove was baptised at St Uny, Redruth.\n\nIn October 1795, Christian was pregnant when her husband was whipped (no baptism record found yet).\n\nA son, Richard Angove baptised on 21st October, 1798 at St Uny, Redruth who likely died as an infant.\n\nOn 26th April, 1801, they baptised another son, Richard Angove at St Uny, Redruth.\n\n…\n\nConclusion and Further research:\n\nThese letters of William Jenkin again show the close association that he had with the extended Grose family.\n\nOther family members are mentioned in ‘News from Cornwall’ by A.K. Hamilton Jenkin who can be researched:\n\nAssuming ‘Aunt Kate’ is an aunt of Matthew, Samuel and Christian Grose – she is either a sister (or sister-in-law) of their parents Matthew Grose (1732) and Mary Davey.\n\nThe same theory can be applied for ‘Uncle Richard Nicholls’ meaning he’s likely a brother-in-law of Matthew Grose (1732) or Mary Davey.\n\nIt is unknown whether Alice Richards is a family member, or perhaps a servant. The Richards/Grose family connections have been mentioned in other letters of William Jenkin and these will be looked at on another post.\n\nMary is likely a younger sister, cousin or niece of Matthew, Samuel and Christian Grose.\n\nFurther research is required for Christian (nee Grose) and Richard Angove and their descendants. Currently have not found a death or burial record for them.\n\n…\n\nResources and ‘Thanks’:\n\nSincere thanks to Peter Gardner for giving permission to use extracts of his essay on the blog.\n\nIn the previous post, the mining careers of brothers, Matthew Grose (1761-1824) and Samuel Grose (1764-1825) were covered. Info was studied in four books containing extracts of their correspondence with William Jenkin (1738-1820).\n\nAll three men were from Redruth, Cornwall. Jenkin looked after mining interests for the Marquis of Buckingham. He appointed Matthew and Samuel Grose as Mine Captains in Cornwall and Somerset.\n\n…\n\nFamily History Clues:\n\nMine Captain!\n\nFrom Jenkin’s letters, we see Matthew Grose (1761-1824) was Mine Captain at Loxton, on the Mendip Hills in Somerset.\n\nWe’d previously discovered that his son (Matthew Grose 1788-1849) and niece, Mary (1788-?) were baptised here at the Parish Church of St. Andrew in Loxton:\n\n© Image courtesy of Somerset Heritage Service; Taunton, Somerset, England; Somerset Parish Records, 1538-1914; Reference Number: D\\P\\LOX/2/1/1 (Somerset, England, Church of England Baptisms, Marriages, and Burials, 1531-1812 via Ancestry.co.uk)\n\n…\n\nInitial research suggested it was a brief, unsuccessful copper mining venture, but Jenkin’s letters show it was a long captaincy.\n\n…\n\nMissing baptisms, children John and Elizabeth Grose:\n\nWith baptism records missing for two of Matthew Grose’s children – John Grose (1793-1842) and Elizabeth (1797-?), we can check again for misspelled records – focusing on Loxton and surrounding area.\n\nFrom Jenkin’s letters we know that Matthew Grose (1761-1824) was still in Loxton in 1794.\n\n1794: Josiah Holdship comes to Somerset seeking the mineral ’emery’. He approaches Matthew Grose at Loxton first, who sends him on to Samuel Grose in Dodington.\n\nvia “Two Men of Very Different Minds”… – Adventurous Ancestors\n\nThis bodes well for finding John and Elizabeth Grose’s baptism records nearby… unless for some reason they were baptised elsewhere!\n\nThere is also the following challenge:\n\n“The early Loxton parish registers were badly worn, thus many entries on the fiche are illegible and others are taking a considerable amount of time to transcribe…\n\n…before 1800 many surnames of similar sound were spelt in a variety of ways, now referred to as variants. There was not the standardised spelling that we have today and few people could write. Many churchwardens couldn’t spell and educated clergyman had to enter a written name that best fitted the sound of the name. It was open to misinterpretation particularly when one considers the various dialects around the country.”\n\nvia Loxton Baptism Registers…. – Somerset Village of Loxton\n\n…\n\nSon, Matthew Grose and grandson, Thomas Grose:\n\nWe know Matthew Grose (1761-1824) was back in Dodington, Somerset by 1820, installing a pumping engine in the Beech Grove House.\n\nBy 1821, his son, (Matthew Grose, 1788-1849) and daughter-in-law, Mary (nee Wearn) are with him. They baptise their son, Thomas Grose at Dodington, Somerset.\n\n(© Image courtesy of Somerset Heritage Service; Taunton, Somerset, England; Somerset Parish Records, Church of England Baptisms, 1813-1914 (via Ancestry.co.uk)\n\n…\n\nMatthew (1788-1849) is listed as a ‘Miner’ on son Thomas’s baptism. Was Matthew working in the Dodington area too, or visiting his bold father, or perhaps en-route to another mine?\n\nWork ceased at the Dodington (Buckingham) mine in 1821 and equipment was sold off in 1822.\n\n…\n\n20 July 1822 – Royal Cornwall Gazette – Truro, Cornwall, England (© Image courtesy of The British Library Board accessed via FindMyPast)\n\n…\n\nGrose family in Sticklepath, Devon?:\n\nIn the 1823 newspapers, at Okehampton, Devon, (approximately 50 miles southwest of Dodington, Somerset), we see a Mine Captain called Matthew Grose at the Sticklepath Copper Mine.\n\nCould this be one of our Cornish Mine Captains – either Matthew Grose (1761-1824), or his son ‘Foxdale‘ Matthew Grose (1788-1849)?\n\n12 June 1823 – Exeter Flying Post – Exeter, Devon, England (© Image courtesy of The British Library Board accessed via FindMyPast)\n\n…\n\nCheck for Clues!\n\nNear to Sticklepath in Devon are the villages of South Zeal and Belstone.\n\nWe see Elizabeth Ash (nee Grose) (1797-?) and her miner husband Obadiah Ash in South Zeal around this time because there are baptism records for their children here.\n\neg, Obadiah Ash junior baptised in 1822.\n\n© Image courtesy of The National Archives of the UK; Kew, Surrey, England; General Register Office: Birth Certificates from the Presbyterian, Independent and Baptist Registry & Wesleyan Methodist Metropolitan Registry; Class Number: RG 5; Piece Number: 172 England & Wales, Non-Conformist and Non-Parochial Registers, 1567-1970 via Ancestry.com\n\nThe mother on the baptism record Elizabeth Ash (nee Grose) is the daughter of Matthew Grose (1761-1824), so the younger sister of Matthew Grose (1788-1849).\n\n…\n\nOn 18th March 1824, we see a baptism in Belstone, Devon for a John Grose, son of Matthew and Mary Grose. Their abode is Sticklepath and the profession of the father is Miner.\n\n© Images courtesy of South West Heritage Trust and Parochial Church Council (Accessed via FindMyPast)\n\n…\n\nAll this evidence points to the Mine Captain of Sticklepath, Devon being ‘Foxdale’ Matthew Grose (1788-1849).\n\nThis is just four years before he migrates to the Isle of Man.\n\nThere is a slim chance that his father is the Mine Captain at Sticklepath, with Matthew just a miner, but unlikely.\n\nHis father, Matthew (1761-1824), passes away this year in August 1824 and from extracts in “Men & Mining on the Quantocks” (Second Edition, Hamilton & Lawrence, 2008) he stubbornly resided in Dodington, (trying to attract new investors for the Buckingham Mine) and died there in grinding poverty.\n\nWas Matthew Grose (1761-1824) alone when he died a pauper in 1824? Were his wife (Jane/Jennifer nee Williams) and youngest daughter, Eliza (1807-1864) still in Somerset at that time too?\n\nTo be resnearched another time!\n\n…\n\nMining Career Clues:\n\nOnly a few gaps remain in the career timelines for the Redruth brothers, Matthew and Samuel Grose. With further analysis of the information from Jenkin’s letters, this will now be easier to research.\n\n…\n\nCONCLUSION:\n\nFound!\n\nFrom reading a few books about mining and further online research, we’ve been able to solve other family history mysteries…\n\n‘Foxdale’ Matthew Grose (1788-1849) was a miner at Dodington, Somerset in 1821 because he was baptising his son Thomas Grose (1821-1882) there.\n\nThis date ties ‘Foxdale’ Matthew to working in Dodington with his bold father, because Matthew Grose (1761-1824) is installing an engine at Beech Grove (and subsequently upsetting the Marquis by moving it to the Glebe House!).\n\nAlso, from connecting a random newspaper clipping about Sticklepath Copper Mines in Devon to the Grose family, we’ve discovered ‘Foxdale’ Matthew Grose (1788-1849) was likely Mine Captain there by 1823.\n\nHis abode was Sticklepath and he baptised his son John Grose at nearby Belstone in 1824.\n\nInteresting to note that ‘Foxdale’ Matthew Grose (1788-1849) chooses a ‘Church of England’ church to baptise his son, John (1824-1888), in Devon.\n\nHis sister Elizabeth Ash (nee Grose) (1797-?) chooses the nearby Methodist Church to baptise Obadiah Ash junior (1822-?).\n\nThe connection between the siblings, Elizabeth Ash (nee Grose) and Matthew Grose, is of particular interest because BOTH migrate to the Isle of Man.\n\nThis will be looked at more closely in a future post.\n\n…\n\nStill to find!\n\nBe nice to find the baptisms for two children of Matthew Grose and Jane/Jennifer Williams:\n\nJohn Grose (1793-1842)\n\nElizabeth Grose (1797-?)\n\nUnless the Loxton Parish Registers are just too badly worn!\n\n…\n\nThanks for reading. Please comment or contact if you’re enjoying the blog, or if you have any info or ideas that might help with some of the mysteries!\n\nThis post covers the mining escapades of two brothers, Matthew and Samuel Grose born in Redruth Cornwall in the 1760’s and worked at mines in Somerset and Cornwall. They were first written about here.\n\nRecap:\n\nMatthew Grose (1761-1824) is the father of Matthew Grose (1788-1849) who moved to be Captain at Foxdale Mines, Isle of Man.\n\nHis brother, Samuel Grose (1764-1825) is the father of ‘the famous engineer’ Samuel Grose junior (1791-1866) who was a pupil of Richard Trevithick and designer of the Cornish engine.\n\n..\n\nIntroduction:\n\nAfter reading these four fantastic books, extra info has been gathered:\n\n“Men & Mining on the Quantocks” (Second edition) by J.R. Hamilton and J.F. Lawrence\n\n“News from Cornwall” by A.K. Hamilton Jenkin\n\n“Mines and Miners of Cornwall (Hayle, Gwinear & Gwithian)” by A.K. Hamilton Jenkin\n\n“The Historic Landscape of the Quantock Hills” by Hazel Riley (free: here)\n\nThe details about Matthew and Samuel Grose in the books are mostly sourced from letters written and received by William Jenkin of Redruth in Cornwall (1738-1820).\n\nWilliam Jenkin looked after the mining interests of the Marquis of Buckingham in Cornwall and developed mining on the Marquis’s Dodington Estate in Somerset.\n\nWilliam Jenkin had a close friendship with Samuel Grose, but an antagonistic relationship with Matthew Grose and this is reflected in his letters. The books interpret this accordingly – hailing sensitive Samuel Grose ‘a Cornish artisan’ whilst outspoken Matthew Grose is deemed the ‘less reputable, impulsive brother’!\n\nMost of the ‘quotes in italics’ in the following timeline are brief extracts from their extensive correspondence with William Jenkin.\n\n…\n\n“Two Men of Very Different Minds”: 1786-1824\n\nCORNWALL TO SOMERSET:\n\n1786: At the age of 25, Matthew Grose leaves Cornwall for Somerset, boldly claiming he is ‘the first miner introduced to seek for Copper at Dodington’ [in recent times]. Matthew begins mining work with a few Cornish Miners on Dodington Common in Somerset. He is then established at the Garden Mine at Dodington in a supervisory capacity.\n\nRelations between the Cornish Miners and locals of Somerset are delicate. Jenkins writes that the local ‘inhabitants seem quite disposed to be offended’.\n\nMatthew’s staff now consists of coal miners from Radstock, Somerset, but he finds them unmanageable and wishes to replace them with Cornishmen, but William Jenkin refuses.\n\nMatthew Grose is overly enthusiastic and unwisely gives the Marquis of Buckingham an exaggerated impression of the value of the veins discovered in Dodington. This annoys William Jenkin and his opinion of Matthew wavers.\n\n1788: Matthew Grose moves sideways to be Captain at the Marquis of Buckingham’s Mine at Loxton, on the Mendip Hills. (His son, Matthew Grose (1788-1849) – is baptised at the Parish church of St. Andrew’s here).\n\nParish church of St. Andrew’s, Loxton © Copyright John Baker and licensed for reuse under this Creative Commons Licence.\n\n1791: Whilst Matthew is in Loxton, his brother, Samuel Grose is appointed senior Mine Captain at Dodington. Some Cornish miners in his employ return to Redruth and it is difficult to attract others to Somerset because ‘the spirit of Mining is high in Cornwall’. Jenkin asks Samuel Grose to give any remaining Cornishmen proper encouragement to stay, or ‘get some of the Somerset young men to become handy’.\n\nSamuel’s ‘famous engineer’ son, Samuel Grose junior (1791-1866) is born at Nether Stowey, Somerset.\n\n1793: The French First Republic declares war on Britain.\n\n1794: Josiah Holdship comes to Somerset seeking the mineral ’emery’. He approaches Matthew Grose at Loxton first, who sends him on to Samuel Grose in Dodington.\n\n1795: Samuel Grose resides at Newhall, near Dodington which has a:\n\n‘colony of unpleasant neighbours… the most profligate and abandoned part of mankind’.\n\nMatthew Grose is still at the Loxton Mine and similarly writes about the:\n\n“…ill-natured prejudice in the behaviour of the inhabitants at Loxton and it’s vicinity against suffering any but themselves to inhabit the county.”\n\nMatthew seems at his wits end about:\n\n“…tenants as could accommodate Shippam Miners with lodging and would not do it.”\n\n1796: Spain declares war on Britain.\n\n1797: A French invasion of Britain is rumoured. Samuel Grose writes that:\n\n‘I cannot think that the French will come here, but I think they will ruin our country by threatening to come.’\n\nThe French briefly invade at Fishguard.\n\n1798: William Jenkin holds shares in Wheal Alfred Mine in Cornwall (named after his son).\n\n1799: There is crisis in the copper trade as prices fall.\n\n1800: Samuel Grose’s spirits fall too. Partly due to the imminent failure of the Dodington mine (a pump is desperately required) and also due to the ‘enormous advanced price of the necessities of life’. Poverty has become extreme in Somerset and Cornwall for working people, including miners.\n\nAfter a woman (about to be arrested for theft) hangs herself in Samuel Grose’s garden, he writes:\n\n“Glad should I be if circumstances should alter so that my removal was nigh from such bad people and such a disagreeable house as Newhall is at this time. I do not believe we can live there. Let the consequence be what it will.”\n\nand\n\n“I would not have my children frightened by this shocking affair, not for all the Gold in the Universe.”\n\nRuined building at New Hall. © Copyright Nick Chipchase and licensed for reuse under this Creative Commons Licence\n\nSamuel desires to move to the Counting House in Dodington (the mine company’s headquarters), but understands ‘it would require £20 to fit it for a dwelling’. Also the mine is unprofitable and closure inevitable.\n\n1801: Jenkin writes to a friend about Samuel Grose:\n\n“…poor Capt. Grose appears to be falling back again. His doctors seem to think that his native air might be of service to him. In that case I could take him back to Cornwall with me, after going to Dodington to supervise the closure of the mine.”\n\nJenkin also writes directly to Samuel:\n\n“Thou shall not want for anything that I can command or procure – therefore write me freely as one Friend should to another”\n\nJenkin makes plans to install Samuel as Captain at Wheal Alfred Mine back in Cornwall.\n\nHe writes to Samuel (about Wheal Alfred Mine and Matthew Grose):\n\n“Thy brother Matthew had set his mind on this appointment for himself but the preference is given to thee. I hope for the sake of his Family that a place will be found by and for him also, but I am sorry to observe that poor Matthew does not make many friends amongst those who would be most likely to have power to serve him. He is too great a talker and too full of himself. A little disappointment may probably be in the ordering of Providence…”\n\nand\n\n“The mine which Matthew is in is likely to go down. I wish he had so good an opening for future employment as thou hast – but he has not thy abilities to recommend him.”\n\n…\n\nAfter fourteen years, mining at Dodington ceases in 1801, with Samuel Grose and a dozen men departing. William Jenkin laments about the ‘scattered bunches of rich ore’ and supposes that at a deeper level it will be more ‘regular and collected’. A powerful steam engine is required to work the deeper, richer veins, but no investment is forthcoming.\n\nAlso in 1801, change is afoot internationally as the fighting with France dwindles and a peaceful conclusion draws near. Jenkins writes:\n\n“After the scourge of War and famine which has long threatened the inhabitants of this land, this is the method that they take to manifest their thankfulness for so great a deliverance. Illuminations, Shouting, Bawling, Huzzaing, Cursing, Drinking, Squibbs, rockets and fire balloons are poured out and scattered through Earth and Air, while the poor and needy are neglected and forgotten.”\n\n…\n\nBACK IN CORNWALL\n\n1802: The Treaty of Amiens temporarily ends hostilities between the French Republic and Britain.\n\n1803: Now back in Cornwall, Samuel Grose is in better spirits as Captain at Wheal Alfred Mine with an engine. “The water is very quick… but I believe we shall be able to endure… I have now a better opinion of Wheal Alfred than I ever had.”\n\n1804: Spain declares war on Britain (again)\n\n1805: Thomas Poole from Nether Stowey in Somerset considers promoting a reopening of the Buckingham Mine at Dodington. (Thomas Poole is a great friend of the poets Samuel Taylor Coleridge and William Wordsworth and for some time they reside closely) .\n\n1806: The eminent inventor and chemist, Humphry Davy is approached for capital and geological advice regarding the peculiar shell limestone formations in Dodington. He responds advising that:\n\n‘Miners from Alston Moor and Derbyshire would understand your Country [mines] better than Cornish miners.’\n\nHumphry Davy declines to ‘adventure’ (invest in the mines) because he is saving to embark on a scientific expedition to Norway, Lapland and Sweden.\n\nPottery mogul Josiah Wedgwood II is also approached to invest, but he’s averse to adventuring money on Somerset Copper mining.\n\nHowever, the high price of copper attracts interest from other investors and mining again at the Buckingham Mine in Dodington becomes a possibility.\n\n1807: Thomas Poole meets with William Jenkin and Samuel Grose for advice on mining matters. Samuel won’t be persuaded back to Somerset as he is now the Mine Agent at ‘a truly great copper mine’ (Wheal Alfred in Cornwall). Jenkin advises that Samuel Grose might be able to give direction by travelling to Somerset three or four times a year. Jenkin does not get directly involved either, however remains as an active well-wisher and helps recruit Cornish miners for the venture in Somerset.\n\n1808: Thomas Poole travels to Cornwall again to see ‘the mines and gigantic machinery employed about them.’ Jenkin doesn’t meet with him – now weary of the Somerset men merely talking about mining, with no action.\n\n1810: Sweden declares war on Britain\n\n1811: Ardent Methodist, Samuel Grose and John Davey (Mine Agents) begin a Sunday School at Wheal Alfred for 250 to 300 children after observing the:\n\n“…profligacy of the Children of many Labourers in that Mine, -and particularly of those who cannot read.”\n\n1812: William Jenkins writes:\n\n“There is too much Copper bringing to Market for the demand”\n\nand of the Anglo-American war of 1812:\n\n“The American War is a great Evil to the Mining Interest in Cornwall. The price of Copper has been gradually declining as the prospect of Peace receded.”\n\n1814: Proposals are made for reworking Herland Mines near Gwinear. According to William Jenkin, his old nemesis, Matthew Grose, has written “a great, blown-up prospectus” .\n\n“Matthew Grose does not, in my opinion, possess that solid Judgement nor that thinking deliberate turn of mind which I consider an essential ingredient to make a Captain fit to direct so weighty an undertaking. One who can indulge himself in what he calls good living so as to become even now unable to go to the bottom of Wheal Alfred, shall not be the Captain of my choice. I do not think he is truly careful of speaking honestly and truly so as to give his employers clear and honest answers to their enquiries – in short he is not Sam, but Matthew Grose – two men of very different minds.”\n\n1815: Matthew Grose and Richard Nicholls proudly return from London with a long list of Adventurers prepared to invest in the Herland Mines. They specify certain conditions about how they are to be paid. They’ve also discovered a shallow level of Silver in the mine that was overlooked in the former working.\n\nWilliam Jenkin grumbles:\n\n“How it may turn out is past my judgement to say – but I don’t feel very sanguine [optimistic] about it.”\n\nWhilst things are possibly looking up for Matthew Grose, his brother Samuel Grose has been under pressure and has run up a debt of £12,000 on Wheal Alfred because…\n\n“…willing to comply with the clamorous demands of some of the Adventurers, [he] kept out of sight some heavy bills for coals, timber, and other articles in order to make dividends.”\n\nJenkin ‘trembles for the consequences’… should this mine go down’ with 1200 men, women and children employed there. He suggests it is the secret wish of some for Wheal Alfred to go down because it would cause copper prices to rise again.\n\n1816: In February, Richard Trevithick’s famous, powerful pole-puffer engine is set to work at Herland Mines.\n\nHowever, by October, Jenkin writes that:\n\n“The Herland business has been so badly managed that the Mine has been stopped for want of money.”\n\n200 labourers are turned idle.\n\n“I wish it may be the last time that London adventurers become directors and managers of Cornish Mines.”\n\nMeanwhile, Samuel Grose is called to write an account of the Buckingham Mine in Dodington, Somerset for newly interested adventurers, attracted by Thomas Poole again.\n\nAlso, 1816 was the year without a summer, with crop failure and food shortages across Britain and beyond. Welsh families became refugees, travelling and begging for food. Global temperatures had decreased by around 0.5°C, possibly due to a volcanic eruption in the East Indies the previous year.\n\n…\n\n1817: Things seem to have gone from bad to worse in Cornwall. Jenkin writes that:\n\n“The two Parishes of Phillack and Gwinear are very populous, chiefly Miners, and are, I believe, more distressed than any other district in this County, for there is not now one Mine in either of the parishes to give employment to them.”\n\n…\n\nBACK TO SOMERSET\n\n1817-1820 A new shaft is sunk and an engine-house is erected at Beech Grove, behind Dodington House in Somerset.\n\nBeech Grove Engine House © Copyright Nick Chipchase and licensed for reuse under this Creative Commons Licence\n\n1820: After an absence of twenty seven years, Matthew Grose returns as Mine Captain to Dodington. He supervises the installation of a Boulton & Watt engine in the Beech Grove house.\n\nShortly afterwards, Matthew requests that the engine be removed from Beech Grove and re-erected at the Sump (Glebe) Shaft to cope with an influx of water.\n\nMatthew Grose writes to John Price on 25 February 1820…\n\n“I am happy to inform you for his Lordship’s information that our prospects in the mine is very good…”\n\nand\n\n“The great increase of water is not a bad symptom, its generally found in all mines the more water, the more ore. I believe shares in this mine may be got at a very easy rate as the pockets of some of the adventurers is very much exhausted, and will not well be able to encounter the expense of removing the engine.”\n\nDisputes arise between various shareholders with the Marquis of Buckingham pressing for a revision of terms and other Adventurers wanting to suspend operations as costs mount. Thomas Poole exercises proxy votes for his friends, forcing the minority to continue. He remains in control for another year.\n\nThe engine is moved to the Glebe Engine House as per Matthew Grose’s request. Although good quality copper ore is raised, the mine remains unprofitable.\n\nGlebe Engine House © Copyright Chris Andrews and licensed for reuse under this Creative Commons Licence\n\nThe Marquis is offended. He strongly opposed the moving of the engine because it would no longer be on his land, so in the event of closure he will find it harder to secure new adventurers (investors). He blames Matthew Grose (as Mine Captain) for orchestrating the manoeuvre.\n\nMatthew Grose now faces impending closure of the uneconomical mine, loss of earnings and the wrath of an antagonistic Marquis.\n\nMatthew writes to the Estate Steward:\n\n“I have learned with some concern that I am discredited with you… for removing the engine without his Lordship’s leave for doing so… I hope no blame can possibly be attached to me.”\n\nMatthew Grose then goes onto explain his many technical and economic reasons for moving the engine from Beech Grove to the Glebe House and the unavoidable costs involved.\n\nThe Marquis’s wrath continues as he expresses more displeasure – he’d been told there were manganese deposits in his mine at Dodington, but these have proved non-existent.\n\nMatthew Grose tries to explain a convoluted catalogue of errors (including an adventurer dying en-route to the mines). He insists the lack of manganese isn’t his fault and blames Richard Symes for mixing up samples of ore:\n\n“Mr Symes says now, the samples he sent must have come from Loxton” [not Dodington]\n\nIn August 1820, Matthew tries to restore relations with the Marquis by sending him a box of mineral specimens:\n\n“…esteemed valuable acquisitions…. better collected for a grotto than the cabinet.”\n\n1821: Work ceases at the uneconomical Buckingham Mine in Dodington after an expenditure of £20,000 and paltry sales of ore of £2,500.\n\nMatthew Grose writes to the Marquis, saying he recommended the:\n\n“Company to stop the mine altogether rather than continue to work with it in a paltry way. “\n\nHe also says:\n\n“I believe that no company that was engaged in mining business was so completely ignorant of the principles of mining, as the Buckingham Mining Company, nor no mine was ever worked in such a shily-shaly way.”\n\nMatthew’s comments about his employer result in his dismissal from the company. He laments:\n\n‘…this extraordinary and unexpected event originated from the belief that I am more inclined to serve his Lordship than the company; though what produced this belief, I know not’\n\nMatthew Grose is instructed to leave the house where he and his family live. No wages are to be paid until he’s complied.\n\nStubbornly, he remains in residence and becomes captain at a small mine 25 miles west of Dodington (likely Luccombe, or similar in the Alcombe-Wootton Courtenay district).\n\nMatthew Grose writes letters to Thomas Crawford, pleading for employment at the Dodington Mine:\n\n‘no person knows the mine as well as myself’\n\nCrawford responds that:\n\n‘You were the company’s servant and as they have suspended working the mine and do not choose to continue you in their service, I do not know in what way I could help you.’\n\nMatthew Grose is not easily silenced and in June 1821, he indignantly writes to Thomas Crawford again:\n\n‘what right has the company to sell gravel from the mine and carry off so much without making acknowledgement to his Lordship?’\n\nand\n\n‘I keep the keys of the counting house, the office and materials house… A small stipend [salary] with the little I receive from the mine in the west will serve to keep my head above water. I ask no more till it is settled.’\n\nIn September, five months after his dismissal, Matthew is offered his wages, only payable up until when the mine had ceased work. He rejects the offer, demanding his salary right up until September. He also rejects their demand that he pay rent on the house.\n\n1822: In August the company surrenders the mining lease. Some adventurers remain interested and want to continue some operations. The Marquis obtains a new report on the mine from Alfred Jenkin and Captain Francis, but it is unfavourable and deters investors.\n\nMatthew Grose remains steadfast and faithful to the mine, despite failing health and an empty pocket. He writes a new prospectus, desperately trying to promote for a new company to rework the Dodington mine. Refusing to return to Cornwall, he lingers on in poverty at Dodington.\n\n1823: Matthew wins the interest of Charles Carne of Exeter who liaises with Matthew Grose’s son John.\n\nCarne applies for a mining lease at the Buckingham Mines, Dodington, but struggles to agree terms.\n\n1824: In February, Charles Carne arranges a meeting with interested parties at the Royal Inn in Bridgwater to raise capital for a new engine for Dodington. Unfortunately the meeting does not happen because Charles Carne has been imprisoned in Exeter ‘by means of a most unlucky adventure in a tin mine in Cornwall.’\n\nAccording to the book, “Men & Mining on the Quantocks (by J.R. Hamilton and J.F. Lawrence)”, Matthew Grose dies as a ‘starving pauper’ in ‘grinding poverty’ and is buried at Dodington Churchyard on 11 May 1824.\n\nThis date concurs with Matthew’s burial record in 1824 and the information from his Memorial which was erected in Gwinear, Cornwall.\n\n…\n\nConclusion:\n\nMatthew and Samuel Grose’s mining adventures (and misadventures) show the struggle between the reality of mining economics and the optimism of miners.\n\nIn the book, “The Historic Lanscape of the Quantock Hills”, Archaeologist, Hazel Riley pays tribute to Matthew Grose’s final bold project:\n\n“The Glebe engine house survives virtually intact to its original roof level. The scatter of red tile fragments around its base shows that it originally had a tiled roof. A large infilled shaft, some 16m in diameter, lies to the south of the engine house and spoil heaps lie to the east. The thick bob wall was on the southeast, the cylinder opening, with a brick arch, was in the northwest wall. Some good quality copper ore was raised from these deeper levels: 100 tons of ore from the Buckingham mines was sampled and shipped from Combwich in 1820 when it was described as ‘rich and of prime quality’ (Hamilton and Lawrence 1970, 62). The engine houses are remarkable testaments to the business acumen of Tom Poole and the practical enthusiasm of Matthew Grose, the mine captain. The Glebe engine house is the oldest intact beam engine house in southwest England (Stanier 2003).”\n\nGlebe Engine House and ruined Miners’ Store © Copyright Nick Chipchase and licensed for reuse under this Creative Commons Licence\n\n…\n\nResources and Further Reading:\n\nBooks:\n\n“Men & Mining on the Quantocks” (Second edition) by J.R.

He managed Ballacorkish Mines on the island and also inspected many others, too numerous to cover in one post.\n\nHe was a mining man through and through. His father, also called Matthew Grose (1788 – 1849), born in Loxton, Somerset, was a Mine Agent who worked in Cornwall, then at Foxdale Mines, Isle of Man from 1828-1846, before opening a ‘fine granite quarry’.\n\nHis grandfather, another Matthew Grose (1761 – 1824) and great uncle, Samuel Grose (1764 – 1825) were Cornish Mine Captains born in Redruth, who worked at mines in Cornwall and Somerset.\n\nMore information about his family can be found here.\n\nPhoto of Matthew Grose 1819-1887 (Courtesy of Manx National Heritage)\n\n…\n\n1819 Matthew was baptised at Phillack, Cornwall on 19th March, 1819.\n\n1828: At the age of nine, Matthew moved to the Isle of Man where his father becomes a Mine Agent at Foxdale Mines.\n\n1841: The census shows Matthew is living and working at Foxdale Mines with his father who is the Mine Agent there. Matthew is working as a miner and his brothers, Thomas and John are engineers. Later that year he married Anne Weston Read.\n\n1846: Slater’s Directory (Douglas) lists Captain Mathew Grose as the Agent to the Foxdale Mining Co. Adress given as Moore’s court, Market place. This is his father, but undoubtably both were still working closely. This is the year his father was dramatically dismissed from Foxdale Mines. The Crown Agent, John Taylor, then stepped in and gave him setts of land & he opened a fine granite quarry.\n\n1846-1851: At some point adventuring, exploration and lead mining begins at Ballacorkish (Rushen Mines) on the hillside above Colby.\n\n1851: The census shows Matthew Grose residing at Ballagawne in Rushen with wife, Annie, four of his children and a house servant. His occupation is given as Agent of Mines.\n\n1852: The Brig Lily is shipwrecked on the islet of Kitterland.

Two shafts had been sunk 600 yards apart and the sett was worked as two separate mines which were known simply as North and South with no connections being made underground. The North, or Phosphate shaft (Rushen mine) was sunk to a depth of 360 feet (60 fathoms) with levels at 15, 30, 45 and 60 fathoms. The bottom levels were driven for 180 feet south and 780 feet north. The South shaft (Ballacorkish) was sunk to a depth of 450 feet (75 fathoms) with levels driven at 12, 24, 36, 60 and the bottom at 75 fathoms which had been driven to a length of 390 feet south and 1470 feet north. Both mines had to pump water out at the rate of about thirty gallons per minute but an adit level driven from the main road also helped to drain the mine and reduce the pumping cost.\n\nExtract from: http://www.manxmines.com/BALLACORKISH.htm\n\n1863: Thwaites Directory (Rushen) lists Captain Matthew Grose as the manager of South Foxdale Mines (Ballacorkish).\n\nThe South Foxdale Silver-Lead Mining Company have recently been established for the working of a set of mines lying south of the Foxdale mines. The set includes the Ballacorkish Mine and is upwards of four miles in extent. The capital of the company is £25,000 raised in shares of £6 each. The works comprise an edit level driven about 300 fathoms, which has yielded a considerable quantity of lead ore and blonde. About 200 fathoms from the entrance is a large east and west lode, from which, within a very small space, a cargo of rich silver ore was raised. About 80 fathoms in advance of this edit, two shafts have been sunk about 20 fathoms deep, and several parcels of ore raised; and a few fathoms from the present end of edit, several lumps of ore near the surface have been found in an east and west direction, yielding from 60 to 60 ounces of silver to the ton of ore.\n\nAlso,\n\n“Captain Grose… has for years past entertained a high opinion of the property”\n\nMona’s Herald, Wednesday, July 01, 1863; Page: 2, Courtesy of Manx National Heritage\n\n1863: Matthew is involved with other mining operations on the island.\n\n“LEAD MINE AT KERROW – MOAR , LEZAYRE .— Some two years ago a company commenced operations in search of the metal in this district, and after bestowing considerable labour and expense , were so ill remunerated for their outlay and trouble that the project was by them abandoned. Not discouraged, however, by a past failure , a new company has been formed, and a number of miners and labourers are now engaged in sinking a shaft and making other necessary preparations for searching for hidden treasures. The new company have not taken to the old working, but opened a new one a little higher up the hill, though in the immediate neighbourhood of the old mine. We bave been informed, on reliable authority, that they have already, during their progress, obtained large Quantities of ore, with encouraging prospects before them. Under the mining skill of Captain Grose, there is no doubt that the resources of this new mine will be fully developed; and if successful ia the enterprise, it will prove a great boon to the labouring classes of this locality.”\n\nMona’s Herald, Wednesday, December 16, 1863; Page: 3\n\n1868: Mining operations are going well at Ballacorkish.\n\nIsle of Man Times, Saturday, May 09, 1868; Page: 6\n\nHis wife Anne died in May 1868.\n\nHe takes out a notice in the newspaper to state that he won’t be responsible for debts contracted by others.\n\nIsle of Man Times, Saturday, June 13, 1868; Page: 8\n\nIn September 1868 he marries his second wife, a widow, Elizabeth Luff (nee Qualtrough).\n\nIn October 1868, two of his sons are in bother for stealing apples.
