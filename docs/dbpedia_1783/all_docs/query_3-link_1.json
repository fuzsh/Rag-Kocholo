        "text": "Grose History, Family Crest & Coats of Arms\n\nOrigins Available:\n\nEngland\n\nGermany\n\nThe history of the Grose family name begins in the German province of Bavaria. Grose is a nickname surname, a class of German names derived from eke-names, or added names, that described people by a personal characteristic or other attribute. Grose is a name for a large person. This family name is derived from the German word gross, indicating prodigious size.\n\nLoading...\n\nEarly Origins of the Grose family\n\nThe surname Grose was first found in Bavaria, where this family name became a prominent contributor to the development of the district from ancient times. Always prominent in social affairs, the name became an integral part of that turbulent region as it emerged to form alliances with other families within the Feudal System and the nation. Guenther Gross, founder of the Bavarian line von Trockau, appeared as early as 1097, when he fought under Gottfried von Bouillon against the infidels; after his period of service he settled in Franconia.\n\nLoading...\n\nEarly History of the Grose family\n\nThis web page shows only a small excerpt of our Grose research. Another 118 words (8 lines of text) covering the years 1501 and 1783 are included under the topic Early Grose History in all our PDF Extended History products and printed products wherever possible.\n\nLoading...\n\nGrose Spelling Variations\n\nIn the medieval era, many different cultural groups lived in the German states. There are thus many regional variations of German surnames from that era. Westphalians spoke Low German, which is similar to modern Dutch. Many German names carry suffixes that identify where they came from. Others have phrases attached that identify something about the original bearer. Other variations in German names resulted from the fact that medieval scribes worked without the aid of any spelling rules. The spelling variations of the name Grose include Gross, Grose, Groes, Grosse, Groess, Groesse and many more.\n\nLoading...\n\nEarly Notables of the Grose family\n\nMore information is included under the topic Early Grose Notables in all our PDF Extended History products and printed products wherever possible.\n\nGrose Ranking\n\nIn the United States, the name Grose is the 6,542nd most popular surname with an estimated 4,974 people with that name. 1\n\nLoading...\n\nGrose migration to the United States +\n\nThousands of German settlers came to North America between the mid-17th and mid-20th centuries.
