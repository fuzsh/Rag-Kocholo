        "text": "anything you would watch out for when naming a child with the last name Gross ([name]Long[/name] O) as far as teasing, etc.? All I have thought of so far is to avoid certain word names and one syllable names. [name]Just[/name] curious if any of you have thoughts on things to avoid to prevent teasing and for a nice name flow. thanks!\n\nIn all seriousness-- are you sure you want to pass this name on? I assume your husband/partner has the name, not you. [name]How[/name] does he feel about it? I think it’s a sterling example of how a perfectly normal, blameless name in its original context takes on a very problematic modern meaning.\n\nIf its non-negotiable (I.e. no Gruss, [name]Grove[/name], hyphenation, creation of a new name from the two of your surnames, etc) then I would say a) teasing at some point is inevitable, but it’s survivable and b) select a cool name which isn’t cartoonish of over the top. [name]Donovan[/name], for example, is a pretty cool-guy name, and it can help lighten and distract attention from Gross. Bolt or [name]Maximus[/name] or Bellissima or something would heighten it. I would also pick something 3+ syllables again to lighten and attract more emphasis away from Gross.\n\nhaha… in all seriousness, it is non-negotiable We are pretty traditional. I took my husband’s last name, dropped my maiden name, and this will be our future children’s last name. I realize some teasing is inevitable with the modern meaning. I agree with your suggestion of something not too over the top. We are attracted to classics or classics with a twist, vintage/meaningful family names. I think [name]Leland[/name] “[name]Lee[/name]” is a likely contender for a boy name and girl names I am all over the place and constantly changing my mind- but I like [name]Elizabeth[/name] “[name]Lizzie[/name]” lately. My great aunt just passed today, her name is [name]Ruby[/name] [name]Lucille[/name], which I find lovely. thanks for you suggestions!\n\nThats a pity then that it is non-negotiable, but then again the meaning of the surname is “tall, big.” So your children can always say ‘look up the meaning! I think you are getting it wrong.’\n\nI agree with blade, something longer than three syllables that isn’t comical would work.\n\nPerhaps something like these?:\n\n[name]Lucinda[/name]/[name]Lucilla[/name]\n\n[name]Emilia[/name]\n\n[name]Aurelia[/name]\n\n[name]Lydia[/name]\n\n[name]Thalia[/name]\n\n[name]Helena[/name]\n\n[name]Nathaniel[/name]\n\n[name]Alexander[/name]\n\n[name]Frederick[/name]\n\n[name]Evander[/name]\n\nI grew up knowing a family with the surname Gross. I’ll be honest, I never thought twice about their last name, perhaps because I knew them from birth and was just accustomed to the sound. I never saw them being teased for their surname; my little church-school really had no bullies, though when they moved on to public school perhaps they took some flack. As [name]Blade[/name] said, “gross” teasing would be survivable. The son had a classic name ([name]Michael[/name]). Daughters were [name]Stephanie[/name] and [name]Brandy[/name]. I thought their names were just fine.\n\nthank you for your input, everyone!! I do not think much of it either, but just wanting to avoid any names that could be obviously teased… example: [name]Isabella[/name], Is, [name]Izzy[/name] is Gross?? I think I would prefer to do with at least a 2 syllable name also. sunshine kid- thanks for the “Tall, big” meaning!!\n\nI know someone with that last name too and as far as I know she’s never encountered problems with it. OH has a one-syllable surname with teasing potential too, so I know your fear in wanting to have a first name that detracts from it. I think something with length would be a good place to start. [name]Elizabeth[/name] ‘[name]Lizzie[/name]’ Gross actually works really well.\n\nI’d avoid anything which can shorten to something inappropriate - [name]Dick[/name] Gross or [name]Willy[/name] Gross can be flipped to Gross [name]Dick[/name]/Gross [name]Willy[/name] - basically meaning disgusting male genetalia, which a boy might struggle with - so I’d rule out [name]William[/name] and [name]Richard[/name] immediately.\n\nI never use the word Gross, so the name doesn’t sound that bad to me…trust me I’ve heard much worse, for example Klitou (Klit-oo) and Cokayne. But I guess it’s where you live is the problem. I know gross is commonly said in the USA/[name]CANADA[/name] so it’s hard to understand how people will react where you are from. But just look at it this way- if people around you are used to your name, they will eventually forget the bad association and to them it will just be another surname (I don’t get shocked anymore when I hear the two previous surnames I mentioned). At the end of the day there’s nothing much you can do about it. [name]Just[/name] choose names you like, but I would suggest a name with at least 2 syllables so you focus more on the first name than the second.\n\nI hope this helped a little!\n\nI know a lot of people named Gross or some combo with Gross- something.\n\nHonestly, I would not have taken it as a married name but I don’t think it’s even the worst surname of people that I know. (Which is probably Lipschitz… or maybe Fuchs… ch said as k…)\n\n[name]Lucilla[/name] or [name]Lucinda[/name] is nice and the length distracts. [name]Elizabeth[/name] is very pretty and unassailably classic. I would probably use a longer R name than [name]Ruby[/name] if given the option - [name]Rowena[/name] or [name]Rosemary[/name] or something.\n\nI was going to suggest you could just relocate to a [name]German[/name] speaking country. Gross = Big in [name]German[/name]. Considerably better association I think. Joking aside…\n\nI agree with pp’s. I\"d avoid names that have a higher teasing potential on their own. [name]Ismene[/name] (Is meanie) for example. Also…\n\nI would also avoid [name]Virginia[/name] as it’s just too close to Virgin and Gross Virgin would be unfortunate."
