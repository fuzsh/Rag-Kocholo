Zurnach, Switzerland? He and his brother, Theobald Gross, came to America in 1741 aboard the ship, Europa.Â They settled in Lancaster County, PA.Â Theobald died a few years later but Simon's descendants eventually came to Southern Kentucky where they became the ancestors of the Clinton County, KY and Pickett County, TN Groce's.\n\nÂ\n\nIt has been reported that when Willis was four, his father,Jesse, met an untimely death at the age of 32 in 1849. I do not believe this is true, however, because I have found Jesse, Sarah, Granville and Willis in the 1850 census living in Overton County, Tennessee under the name âGrossâÂ At any rate, in 1859, when Willis was fourteen years of age, his mother, Sarah, bought a 246-acre farm in the Lovelady Community of Overton (now Pickett) County, Tennessee known as the\"Old Mayberry Place\".Â The farm has been owned for many years by Dave and Robbie Hassler and is the present-day home of Robbie who is the great great grand-daughter of Jesse and Sarah Groce through their son, Willis (Willis-Sarah- Mary-Robbie).Â Robbie has arranged to place the farm in the Land Trust for Tennessee through the granting of a permanent conservation easement for the remaining 155 acres of the âOld Mayberry Placeâ.Â In 1859, the farm represented a new beginning for Sarah and her two sons as they came from nearby Clinton County, KY to their new home in Tennessee.\n\nÂ\n\nThe farm apparently had a crude log cabin on it at the time,for their first major undertaking was to build a new log home.Â The log house, with substantial modification and modernization is presently occupied by Robbie Hassler.\n\nÂ\n\nIn 1861, with the beginning of the Civil War, Granville was eighteen and enlisted to serve with the Confederate Army.Â Willis was only sixteen at the time and stayed atÂ home to look after their mother and to complete the log house they had started earlier.Â During the War, Willis assisted the Confederates by serving as a scout in the area. He often had to hide in the caves along the bluffs of the Wolf River to avoid detection by the Union Soldiers.\n\nÂ\n\nThe log house was completed sometime during the Civil War.Â On November 14, 1867, Willis and Mary Elizabeth Huddleston, the daughter of Wiley Howard Huddleston, who owned a neighboring farm, made the twenty-mile trip to Livingston, TN, the county seat,obtained a marriage license and were married by Simon H. Flowers,Â a local minister.Â At that time, the trip must have taken at least two days.Â The marriage license required taking out a bond to the State of Tennessee for $1250.00, payable if there arose any legal reason why the two parties should not be married.Â Willis and Mary had nothing to worry about -- their first child , Sarah, was three years old at the time and their second,Viola, was born seven months later.\n\nÂ\n\nWhen Willis' brother, Granville, returned from the War, he met Mary's sister, Janette Caroline Huddleston, and the two of them were married, probably in 1868.Â As children began to arrive to the two couples, the little log home was beginning to show signs of over-crowding.Â The census of 1870 shows nine people living there:Â Sarah; Granville and Nettie and Permelia, a 9-month old daughter; Willisand Mary, Sarah (6), Viola(3), and Lumilda (6mos). By early 1879, there were fifteen people in the two families including Sarah.Â It has been suggested that Willis and Maryand their children had moved to a small cabin somewhere between the location of the cabin he had built during the Civil War and Mary's home place, Wiley Huddleston's home, now called the Sims place in Lovelady.\n\nÂ\n\nIn December of 1877, Willis bought the 252-acre farm that had belonged to Capt. Creed T. Huddleston (who died \"of disease in Mexico City\" during the war with Mexico). The sale was by theÂ courts to settle the inheritance of SophranaHuddleston, the minor daughter (and only child) of Simon W. Huddleston, the son of Creed T. Huddleston.Â Simon died in 1863 at the age of 28, probably in the War between the States, and a W.H.Harrison, probably her maternal grandfather, had been appointed as Sophrana'sguardian.Â The sale was held on December 27, 1877 and Willis bought the farm and \"the mansion house\" for$325.00. The deed finalizing the sale was dated February 26, 1878.\n\nÂ\n\nProbably at Willis' request, in March of 1879, Sarah deeded the 246-acre farm in Lovelady to her sons, Granville and Willis, maintainingfor herself a life estate.Â Immediately,(the deed was dated two days previously) Willis sold his interest in the property to Granville for $550.00.\n\nÂ\n\nWillis then moved his family, at that time Mary and six of their twelve children, to the farm about 1/2 mile south of Byrdstown where he lived the remainder of his life.Â Willis died September 18, 1911 at the age of sixty-six and Mary died March 14, 1913 at the age of seventy one.Â Both are buried in the Groce Family Cemetery near the old home place.Â\n\nÂ\n\nIn 1907, Willis sold 100 acres of the farm to his son,Granville Armster, and the balance was distributed among other family members in settlement of Willis' estate.Â Armster's grand-daughter, Karen Â Smith, Betty's daughter, and her husband,Lynn, Â nowÂ own the remainder of the farm Armster bought from Willis in 1907.\n\nÂ\n\nSarah continued to live with Granville's family at the Old Mayberry Place in Lovelady until her death in 1891.Â Granville and his family sold the farm in 1896 and moved a short distance down the Wolf River where they bought the farm that was home to him until his death in 1924 and then became the \"Turney Groce Place\".Â Granville had sold the Old Mayberry Place to a couple by the name of Chilton who lost it in 1909 by foreclosure from Pickett County Bank and Trust Co.\n\nÂ\n\nWillis and Mary raised a large family, with nine of twelve children surviving.Â Most of them went onto higher educations and became teachers andÂ professionals.Â Willis Curtis became a doctor and carried on a lifelong family practice in Byrdstown and Pickett County.Â Ben Eston, the youngest son, was teaching school in Willow Grove, TN in about 1929Â when he was asked to represent a local person in a lawsuit brought against that person. Although Ben had no legal training or experience, he successfully argued the case and won the lawsuit for the local person.Â Some local citizens were so impressed with his performance that they arranged for Ben to attend Cumberland Law SchoolÂ in Lebanon for a time sufficient enough for him to pass the Tennessee State Bar Examination.Â He then became an attorney after having taught school for a number of years.Â He conducted an active legal practice in Byrdstown until his death in 1950.Â He was also Superintendent of the County Schools for several terms. He was an avid fisherman and spent much time on the new Dale Hollow Lake after the dam was built at Celina and the lake was enclosed in 1943.Â His favorite fishing holes were in the Wolf River backwaters of the lake. He kept a boat tied up near the old highway 42 bridge over the lake and would go there often to test his skills.Â Â Ben's love for fishing has been passed on to many of his descendents, now about eighty, asÂ we move on into the 21st century.Children were: Lou Groce, Viola Ann Groce, Sarah A.
