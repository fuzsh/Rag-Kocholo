        "text": "My name is Carson Grose and I'm 16 years old and go to Round Rock High School in Round Rock, Texas. I'm a pitcher and infielder, and sometimes play outfield. The biggest obstacle I've had to overcome so far is a growth plate fracture in my elbow. It has since healed and I am working hard to catch up with my teammates so I can make the team this year. I have been growing so I am now throwing harder. Also, I've always done a good job of hitting my spots with the three pitches that I have and have a high percentage of strikes.\n\nI started playing baseball around 4 or 5. At first i didn't like it and would ask my dad if we could leave after the game had just started because it was boring. After a few seasons, I got a coach that turned me on to the game and after that I have loved it.\n\nBaseball has taught me that there's going to be good days and bad days but I've got to keep being positive and focus on the next play or the next day to make it better than yesterday.\n\nMy parents and grandparents have influenced me on who I am. They've told to never back down from anything that's in my way. My dad has paved the way in things such as guiding me and giving the opportunity to play baseball.\n\nMy goals for high school baseball are to make the team every year and to be a starter. In the classroom my goals are to have at least an 85 average in every class. For college, one of my biggest aspirations is to earn a scholarship at a school where I can earn a degree in an area that I am interested in, play great baseball on a team where I fit, and give back to the school and its community."
