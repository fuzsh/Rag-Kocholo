        "text": "Presumably there is a family seat, eg manor associated with this family. You may not find exact records for some but the thing is to look for family seat, court records, law records, so you can establish where they are likely to baptise children and marry. If they are part of Royal Court they would have to ask permission to marry. Have you tried Debretts which lists family tree for aristocratic families? The family in the earlier dates may still have had lands in France and may have married overseas.\n\nThe Gross family are not descended from William le Gros. Howevere my Basset family is descended from his eldest dasughter vias the Chichester and Courtenay families. So if you have a Basset in your Gross family you will be descended from him.\n\nI have all the family back to Hugo and Alicia . A branch of the family from William le Gros went back to France and lived in Dijon. So we know from them that the le Gros family came from the Moselle, Lorraine region of France . Anyone (Christian )with the surname Gross from the German side of the Rhine and from Switzerland is also descended from them.\n\nThey arose during the lifetime of Charles Le Gros Duke of Lower Lorraine, died 1025, but it is not known if he was an ancestor . However they lived in an estate and large house built by him called Le Gros Chateau Neuf. It is on the Chateau Landon estate.\n\nI am descended from 2 Gross families who moved to Cornwall, both sons of John Gross and Margery Candler. By 1600 to 1890 my Gross family were landed gentry in Cornwall and owned most of the Lizard peninsula. They married into the Basset family and the descendants of Thomas Arundell. They were staunchg royalists and lost against Oliver Cromwell in Oxfordshire.\n\nHi All\n\nl am new to this site so not really sure how it works but l am also researching the surname Gross to date from Chelveston Cum Caldecote Northamptonshire England.\n\nMy Earliest Gross is my Distant Grandfather Joseph Gross Born maybe around 1760 ?? Where unknown as can not as yet find a baptism that if if he was, Joseph was a farmer in Chelveston and married a Anna Maria Lenton on 18th April 1787 at chelveston Northamptonshire.\n\nJoseph And Anna had the following children:\n\nThomas Gross Baptized 10th June 1787 Chelveston and married Mary Sopps they had 6 Children\n\nMay Gross Baptized 24th March 1793 Chelveston\n\nWilliam Gross Born about 1796 Chelveston\n\nAnna Maria Gross Baptized 19th September 1805 Chelveston\n\nmarried Josiah Batson/Bateson they had 11 Children\n\nSarah Ann Gross My Distant Grandmother Baptized 19th September 1805 Chelveston the same day as her sister Anna Maria Sarah married Simon Allen on 13th July 1826 Chelveston they had 9 children.\n\nl thought l would add my Gross link incase someone relates to my information\n\nKind Regards\n\nNadine\n\nHello, I hope this post finds you three years after the fact but I stumbled upon this while doing some research just now. I am posting a link to a site that seemingly as all the information you are looking for within the Gross Family Tree, beginning with Sir William Le Gross. The tree is considered \"complete\" and holds up against my own research as well as others'. Best of luck in your research, may this hold the answers you seek\n\nA Gross Family member,\n\nTrel\n\nhttp://www.ourfamilyhistories.org/getperson.php?personID=I15346&tree=00"
