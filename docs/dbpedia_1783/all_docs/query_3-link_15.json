With him or soon afterward came his brother Edmund Gross, a seafaring man, who was a proprietor of Boston as early as 1639, and was admitted to the Boston Church March 22, 1645, with his wife Katharine.

Charles Edward, son of Mason Gross, was born in Hartford, August 18, 1847. He attended the public schools of Hartford, and graduated from Yale University in 1869. While in college he was a member of Alpha Delta Phi, and was one of the leading members of the Phi Beta Kappa fraternity. The first year after leaving college he taught in Hall’s school at Ellington. In 1870 he returned to Hartford and took up the study of law under Hon. Charles J. Hoadley, the state librarian, and later in the office of Waldo, Hubbard & Hyde. In September 1872, he was admitted to the bar of Hartford county, and remained as a clerk with Waldo, Hubbard & Hyde. Four years later in January 1877, he was admitted a member of the firm. On the death of Judge Waldo in 1881, the firms name was changed to Hubbard, Hyde & Gross, and after Governor Hubbard’s death in 1884 it became Hyde & Gross & Hyde. Later after the death of Hon. Alvan P. Hyde, it became Gross, Hyde & Shipman, which it still remains, the partners now being Charles E. Gross, William Waldo Hyde, Arthur L. Shipman, Charles Welles Gross and Alvan Waldo Hyde, all graduates of Yale. Mr. Gross has had a very large practice as an insurance and corporation lawyer, with few equals in the state, and has gained an enviable reputation for his skillful handling of the many important cases which he has conducted. He stands among the first in the state in his profession. He is a director in the Aetna Insurance Company and has been a director of the Phoenix Mutual Life Insurance Company since its reorganization in 1889. In 1893 he was chose a director of the New York & New England Railroad Company. He is vice-president of the Society of Savings, the largest institution of the kind in Connecticut. He has been since 1898 the president of Holyoke Water Power Company which controls the dam across the Connecticut river at Holyoke, Massachusetts. For a number of years he represented Mrs. Samuel Colt on the board of directors of the Colts Patent Fire Arms Manufacturing Company and has been an active director in many other corporation.

He was one of the organizers of the Hartford Board of Trade and has been a member of it’s board of directors since its organization and was for several years it’s president. In 1885 he became secretary of a committee of twenty appointed to arouse the public interest to the importance of action on the license and other public questions, and no man on the committee did more work or showed greater interest in the work than he. In 1891 he was one of a special committee of five, appointed by the town, under Professor John J. McCook as chairman, on outdoor alms. It was found that the United States led the world as to expense per capita on outdoor alms giving, that Connecticut led the states, and that Hartford led Connecticut. Mr. Gross attended to the legal questions and bearings of the case in the report of the committee and did efficient work. The report created a sensation in the city and state, and was the direct means of stopping abuses. It has since been introduced into several colleges as a text book on charitable work, on account of it’s great statistical value. Mr. Gross was the first president of the City Club, created for municipal reform. In all his work Mr. Gross has the best interests of the city at heart. The Hartford Courant speaks as follows of the important service rendered by him to the medical practitioners of Connecticut: “The active struggle before the last legislature over the Medical Practice Act is still remembered all over the state, as is the fact brought out at the hearing that Charles E. Gross, who so ably managed the ease for the Connecticut Medical Society, declined to accept any fee for his services. The doctors, however, have taken another way to testify their appreciation of his assistance, and yesterday the society, through its officers, presented him with a unique and very choice testimonial. It is in the shape of a beautiful hand-made volume, bound in white morocco, and enclosed in a rich silk case. The book, on opening is found to consist of a number of parchment pages on which are exquisitely engrossed the resolutions of thanks passed by the society. The illuminated lettering in colors is worthy of the old monks, and the whole work is noticeably beautiful *** The resolutions which were printed in the volume are as follows: In recognition of the distinguished service rendered to the people of Connecticut by Charles E. Gross, Esq., in connection with the recent passage of the Medical Practice Bill by the legislature, and in view of the fact that this service has included many scores of conferences with the members of the committee which represented this society in securing such legislation, the drafting of the bill and subsequent modifications of it: the presentation of the most cogent of arguments in favor of its enactment: which latter has covered some years and all of which has been done without compensation, and often with great personal inconvenience and sacrifice of business interests, and with such devotion to the welfare of all concerned as to render it almost if not quite unique in character; therefore, “Resolved: That the Connecticut Medical Society hereby expresses its high appreciation of these services of Mr. Gross, and begs to extend to him in behalf of its members and its constituency its thanks and congratulations, that this resolution be spread upon the records of the society, and that a copy be suitably engrossed for presentation to him.” He married October 5, 1875 to Ellen C. daughter of Calvin and Clarissa M. (Root) Spencer of Hartford.
