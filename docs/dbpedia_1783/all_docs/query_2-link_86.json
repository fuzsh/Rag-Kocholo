        "text": "About the UO School of Music:\n\nAs a member of the American Association of Universities, the University of Oregon is considered one of the top research universities in the country, at the same time it has been acknowledged as being one of America’s “best buys” for a college education, by such publications as the Fiske Guide.\n\nThe UO School of Music is the only professional school for music in Oregon, and is consistently regarded as one of the best on the West Coast. If you are interested in learning more about the UO tuba/euphonium studio, or the UO School of Music,\n\nContact Michael Grose\n\nmgrose@uoregon.edu\n\nAbout Professor Grose - https://music.uoregon.edu/people/faculty/mgrose\n\nWhat about the UO tuba/euphonium studio…what makes it special?\n\nEnvironment: The studio mood is serious, but supportive and friendly. Studio members are expected to work hard, however, there is much opportunity for fun and camaraderie.\n\nTime and attention: Professor Grose is full-time at UO. He is not an adjunct professor. As a result, in addition to the standard weekly lesson (1 hour), there is studio class (1 hour), and tuba/euphonium ensemble (1 hour), all of which adds up to 3 hours each week of student/teacher contact. When you shop around you will not find very many other tuba/euphonium programs that offer so much weekly attention with the professor, especially at colleges where the tuba/euphonium professor is an adjunct.\n\nResults: Mr. Grose’s teaching is highly regarded. Many former students have gone on to fill positions in major orchestras major military bands, music educator posts, and have been admitted to top music schools and conservatories around the United States, such as Curtis, Yale, and Peabody, to name a few. Here is a list of notable student successes:\n\nUO School of Music Tuba/Euphonium Studio Achievements 2002-present\n\n2024 The Salvation Army USA Divisonal Encore!
