        "text": "Logged off for the final time last night after 2.5 years at Common Room. This journey all started a startup ago, when I realized that selling our great product was a lot harder than it should be. When I dug into the why, I found that another startup was controlling the narrative in the space, positioned as the default choice within our market (observability). The secret sauce: they had a community of practitioners with over 15K members within their Slack. They owned the place where their target persona hung out and were present for all the conversations. They built content with these individuals and had the opportunity to learn faster through exposure. In spite of having a superior product, it was going to be an uphill battle converting folks to our ideology. That’s how I found Common Room. I was researching how to reproduce this “community” for our prospects and customers. I knew high value users preferred to interact in these channels, because during an early experiment, I had customers that spent >$500K asking their questions in Slack and answering for others. I just had to know who these individuals were. And better yet, find a way to map this experience across all the other touchpoints they had with our company, regardless of if it came from how they used the product, their interactions with marketing, or where they were in the sales process. And unbeknownst to me, a stealth company called Common Room was just starting on their journey to solve this. I jumped at the opportunity to figure out how to turn this idea into a business. 2.5 years later, I’m filled with pride, pride in the companies that bet on me and our product, pride in weathering and even thriving at a time when the market conditions decimated our core buyer and our more established competitors, and pride in the consistency and effort it took to build the brand that we have today. As with anything important in life, there are a ton of folks that contributed to my success. You know who you are. That product leader that sold me with your clarity of vision, customer empathy, and high bar. That Engineering team that delivered and kept delivering. Those design wizards that turned heads in every demo. The leadership that trusted me and supported me as navigated transaction after transaction, each with more complexity. Our small but mighty community team, the secret to how we built trust and belief in our brand. Our marketers, somehow finding a way to tell a cohesive and powerful story in spite of an ever-changing product and market. To our customer success team, keeping us rooted in delivering outcomes for customers regardless of the effort required. And finally, to our customers and community. You were the first thing I thought about when I woke up and the last thing I checked on every night (yeah, I’ve got a problem). The time y’all shared with me is something I value beyond belief. Thank you. #nextplay"
