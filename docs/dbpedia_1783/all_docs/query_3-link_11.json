        "text": "Leaving the south west and heading north.\n\nMatthew Grose, born in 1788, is the Adventurous Ancestor who left the mines of Cornwall and Somerset in England.\n\nAround 1828 he was seeking new opportunities in the mines of Foxdale in the Isle of Man.\n\nMoving with his wife, children, other family members, friends and mining / engineering colleagues from Cornwall – they all headed across the breezy Irish Sea.\n\n…\n\n…\n\nUpon arrival in the Isle of Man, his community-minded wife, Mrs Mary Grose (nee Wearn), would have noticed the hustle and bustle in the town of Douglas.\n\n“Women often with round hats, like the Welsh, and girls without shoes and stockings, though otherwise not ill dressed..”\n\n(Extract from a visitor’s diary in 1828)\n\n…\n\nBringing mining expertise to the island\n\nMatthew Grose came from a renowned family of mining captains and engineers. Like other Cornishmen migrating to the Isle of Man, he brought with him specialised skills and direct experience of new technologies that were revolutionising mining at that time.\n\nPreviously we’ve read about his father, Matthew Grose (1760 – 1824) and uncle, Samuel Grose senior (1764 – 1825) who were mining captains in Cornwall and Somerset.\n\nCaptain Matthew Grose (1788 – 1849) was a first cousin to Captain Samuel Grose junior (1791 – 1866), who was a pupil of Richard Trevithick. Samuel Grose junior was called the ‘most scientific engineer in Cornwall’.\n\n…\n\n…\n\nMany of Matthew Grose’s sons became mine captains, agents and engineers. His sisters and daughters married into families of other Cornish mine captains and engineers.\n\nTimeline for Matthew Grose (1788 – 1849)\n\n1788 Matthew Grose is baptised at the parish church of St Andrew, Loxton, Somerset. His father, Matthew Grose and uncle, Samuel Grose are likely in Loxton with other Cornish miners on an expedition to explore the green veins that have been found in the caves there. Unfortunately these contain no copper and the venture is abandoned.\n\n1789 (likely earlier) – 1800 His father, Matthew and uncle, Samuel are mine captains at the Dodington copper mines.\n\n…\n\n1793? His brother John baptised in ?\n\n1797? His sister, Elizabeth baptised in Somerset? (Wife of Obadiah Ash?).\n\n1801 Dodington copper mine in Somerset closes when unable to raise capital to buy a steam pumping engine.\n\n1801 His brother William and sister Grace are baptised in Gwinear.\n\n1807 His sister Elizabeth (Eliza) is baptised in Gwinear\n\n1809 His sister, Mary, marries Henry Francis in Gwinear.\n\n1809 Aged 21, he marries Mary Vivian Wearn in Phillack.\n\n1810 His uncle, Samuel Grose snr and cousin, Samuel Grose jnr, puts their names to a ‘protest of miners’ at Wheal Alfred in the Royal Cornwall Gazette. They are distancing themselves from political reformist, Edward Budd who was establishing a new newspaper (the West Briton or Miners Journal). A ‘Matthew Grose’ signs the petition too – likely him (or father).\n\n1812 His daughter, Emma is baptised in Phillack.\n\n1814 His daughter Jane is baptised in Phillack. On one census she describes herself as from Relubbus. Perhaps her father worked at mines near there.\n\n1817 His daughter Mary is baptised in Phillack\n\n1817 Dodington Copper mines in Somerset reopen when a steam pumping engine is installed.\n\n1819 His son, Matthew is baptised in Phillack.\n\n1821 His son, Thomas is baptised in Dodington, Somerset\n\n1821 Dodington mines in Somerset close after heavy losses.\n\n1824 His father, Matthew Grose, is buried in Dodington, Somerset\n\n1826 His son John is born in England. (No baptism record found yet). John is husband of Charlotte Clucas.\n\n1826 His daughter Mary is baptised in Phillack.\n\n1828 Isle of Man mining company formed by investors from Liverpool, Chester and Flintshire and lease Foxdale mines.\n\n1831 His daughter Eliza Grace is baptised in Marown, Isle of Man\n\n1832 His son Edwin William Wearn Grose is baptised in Marown, Isle of Man\n\n1833 His daughter Lavinia is baptised in Marown, Isle of Man\n\n1835 His eldest daughter, Emma, marries Captain Jonathan Harrison (both ‘of Foxdale Mines’) at Kirk Patrick, Isle of Man. The couple move to Llanidloes in Wales, then onto Meadowtown, Westcott and Snailbeach mines in Shropshire.\n\n1835 His son, Samuel Grose is baptised in Marown, Isle of Man\n\n1837 His sister, Eliza, marries Captain Absalom Francis in Shrewsbury, Shropshire and then to the mines of Halkyn, Flintshire.\n\n1839 His wife Mary Wearn passes away at Foxdale Mines, Isle of Man. Her obituary in the West Briton newspaper, Jan 25, 1839 reads\n\n“On Tuesday, the 8th instant, at Foxdale Mines, Isle of Man, Mary, the beloved wife of Captain Matthew Grose, aged 49 years, deeply regretted by all her family and friends. Her charities and benevolence had endeared her to all classes, and in her the poor of the surrounding district have lost a kind benefactor and adviser.“\n\nManks Advertiser, Tuesday, January 08, 1839; Page: 3, Courtesy of Manx National Heritage\n\n1839 Aged 51, He marries his second wife, Mary Tregonning in Holywell, Flintshire\n\n1840 His daughter, Jane, marries Richard Powning in Marown, Isle of Man. The witness to their marriage is Foxdale Mine Captain Edward Bawden.\n\n1841 He appears on the 1841 census at Foxdale Mines, Isle of Man as a Mine Agent along with his children Matthew (miner), Thomas (engineer), John (engineer), Mary, Eliza, Edward, Lavinia and Samuel.\n\n1844 Examines lead ore in Castletown\n\nManx Sun, Saturday, May 04, 1844; Page: 4, Courtesy of Manx National Heritage\n\n1841 His son, Captain Matthew Grose, marries Anne Weston Read in Kirk German, Isle of Man.\n\n1841 His mother, Jane/Jennifer passes away in Goldsithney, Perranuthnoe, Cornwall. Her obituary in the West Briton newspaper reads\n\n“At Goldsithney, in Perranuthnoe, on the 23rd instant, at the house of her son, Capt. John Grose, Mrs. Jane Grose, aged 80 years, relict of the late Capt. Matthew Grose, formerly of Gwinear, and of Dodington in Somerset, much regretted and respected by her numerous family and friends. Her end was peace.”\n\n1846\n\nDramatically dismissed (see separate blog post) from the Isle of Man Mining Company\n\nManx Sun, Saturday, January 10, 1846; Page: 8, Courtesy of Manx National Heritage\n\n1846\n\nOpens stone quarry to send granite to Birkenhead for building docks.\n\n1849\n\nMatthew Grose passes away.\n\nManx Sun, Wednesday, June 27, 1849; Page: 5\n\nHe is buried at Marown, Isle of Man\n\n…\n\nResources and further reading:\n\nhttp://www.manxmines.com/manx__mines__history.htm\n\nhttp://www.bbc.co.uk/history/domesday/dblock/GB-226000-476000/page/10\n\nhttp://www.nmrs.org.uk/assets/pdf/BM3/BM3-34-42-introduction.pdf\n\nhttps://www.gov.im/lib/docs/mnh/education/trb/mining/teachersresourcebkpt2thestoryofmi.pdf\n\nhttp://www.cornish-mining.org.uk/delving-deeper/cornish-mining-isle-man\n\n…\n\nPlease contact if you spot any errors, or have additional information to improve this post!\n\nResearching the Grose family history in the Isle of Man leads us over to Cornwall where Mining Captain Matthew Grose (1819 – 1887) was born.\n\nHis parents were Matthew Grose and Mary Vivian Wearn who married in Phillack, Cornwall on 6th June, 1809.\n\nHe was baptised in Phillack, Cornwall on 19th March, 1819 and buried in Arbory, Isle of Man on 14th October, 1887.\n\n…\n\nSome questions included…\n\nWho was his father, (also called Captain Matthew Grose), born c1788 and buried in Marown, Isle of Man on 23rd June, 1849? It had always been a struggle to find a baptism record for him.\n\nWas there any family connection to Captain Samuel Grose (1791 – 1866), ‘the most scientific engineer in Cornwall’?\n\nThe breakthrough came from two baptism records written side-by-side from the parish church of St Andrew in LOXTON, Somerset!\n\n…\n\nResearching Matthew and Samuel Grose\n\nIn the 1700s and 1800s, the names ‘Matthew Grose’ and ‘Samuel Grose’ appear many times. There were confusing connections between Redruth, Hayle, Phillack and Gwinear in Cornwall, Somerset, Halkyn in Flintshire and the Isle of Man.\n\nTime to attempt to work out ‘who was who’ and ‘what was what’.\n\nLet’s start with two other mining captains, also called Matthew and Samuel Grose – two brothers baptised at St Uny in Redruth in the 1760s. (They had other interesting siblings – to be discussed another time).\n\nThese two brothers, Matthew and Samuel Grose worked as mine captains at Dodington in Somerset.\n\nTheir parents were likely Matthew Grose (1732- ) and Mary Davey.\n\nCAPTAIN MATTHEW GROSE (1761-1824)\n\nMatthew Grose was baptised at St Uny, Redruth on 24th May, 1761.\n\nHe married Jane/Jennifer Williams on 21st April, 1783 at St Uny, Redruth.\n\nMatthew and Jane/Jennifer Grose’s children:\n\nMary baptised in St Uny, Redruth, Cornwall, 11th April 1784\n\nMary baptised in St Uny, Redruth, Cornwall, 14th May 1786\n\nMatthew baptised at St Andrew’s Church in Loxton Somerset in 1788. This is who married Mary Vivian Wearn in 1809. They migrated to the Isle of Man in the 1820s where he was a Mine Captain at Foxdale and Ballacorkish (Rushen) mines. He married his second wife, Mary Tregonning, in Flintshire in 1839. (His son was Captain Matthew Grose (1819 – 1887) who took over at Ballacorkish mines & also captain at others).\n\nJohn baptised in ? in 1793?\n\nElizabeth baptised in Somerset in 1797? Wife of Obadiah Ash.\n\nWilliam baptised in Gwinear, Cornwall, 27th December, 1801\n\nGrace baptised in Gwinear, Cornwall, 27th December 1801\n\nElizabeth (Eliza) baptised in Gwinear, Cornwall, 15th March 1807. Likely the second wife of Absalom Francis, married in Shropshire, 1837 and lived in Halkyn, Flintshire.\n\nThis Matthew Grose, born 1760, was buried in Dodington, Somerset in 1824.\n\n…\n\nCAPTAIN SAMUEL GROSE (1764 – 1825)\n\nSamuel Grose was baptised at St Uny, Redruth, 26th December 1764.\n\nHe married Eleanor Giddy at St Uny, Redruth on 21st June 1786\n\nSamuel and Eleanor Grose’s children\n\nEleanor baptised in Holford, Somerset, 24th December 1786 (born 12th October, 1786)\n\nMary baptised in St. Andrew’s Church in Loxton, Somerset in 1788\n\nMary baptised in Luxborough, Somerset in 1789 (TBC)\n\nSamuel baptised in Somerset, 1791. He married Ann Vivian in 1812. He was a pupil of Richard Trevithick and designer of the Cornish Engine. ‘The oldest and most scientific engineer in Cornwall.‘\n\nMatthew baptised at All Saints church in Dodington, Somerset, 11th December 1795. Unmarried, copper miner/Mine Agent on censuses of 1841 and 1851 in Gwinear.\n\nEdward Giddy baptised in Nether Stowey, Holford, Somerset, 22nd November 1799 (&/or 28th Nov 1799 in Taunton, Somerset).\n\nElizabeth Giddy baptised in Gwinear, 6th January 1805.\n\nJames baptised in Gwinear, Cornwall, 25th February 1810. Wesleyan Methodist Minister.\n\nThis Samuel Grose, born 1764, was buried in Gwinear in Cornwall in 1825.\n\n…\n\nMining Captains on the move!\n\nThe baptism locations of their children all have links to the mining and engineering activities of the Grose family in Cornwall and Somerset.\n\nRedruth, Cornwall\n\nBoomed from the 1730s for tin and copper mining when steam engines were used to pump water out of deeper mines. Town grew rapidly in the late 18th century.\n\nLoxton, Somerset\n\nLoxton Cavern was written about in ‘The Gentlemans Magazine’ in 1794.\n\nCornish miners came to the caves in the 1790s where green veins were tested for copper. Upon assay they contained no copper and the venture was abandoned. The Cornish miners removed stalactites, possibly for sale or souvenirs.\n\nDodington, Nether Stowey and Luxborough, Somerset\n\nThe Dodington estate was inherited by the Marquis of Buckingham in 1762.\n\nWilliam Jenkin (a close associate of the Grose family) was the mine agent for the Marquis’s Cornish mines and developed mining on the Dodington estate.\n\nCopper was mined sporadically from the 1780s until 1801, but the mine closed when unable to raise capital to buy a steam pumping engine.\n\nTom Poole’s business acumen and ‘the practical enthusiasm of Matthew Grose‘ the mine captain, lead to a steam pumping engine being installed and mining began again from 1817 until ceasing in 1821 after heavy losses.\n\nGwinear, Cornwall\n\nGwinear lies two miles east of Hayle and there were many mines and engineering works in the area.\n\nSamuel Grose (1791-1866) designed the Cornish engine and some were built by Sandys Vivian and co. at the Copperhouse Foundry in Hayle.\n\nMaking Connections\n\nDescending from the two brothers from Redruth, Cornwall who went copper mining in Somerset – we can see that Captain Matthew Grose (1788 – 1849) who migrated to the Isle of Man was the first cousin of Captain Samuel Grose (1791 – 1866), ‘the oldest and most scientific engineer in Cornwall.’\n\nSources and further reading:\n\nMost records from searches on Ancestry, FamilySearch and Find My Past\n\nhttps://www.amazon.co.uk/Mining-Quantocks-John-Frederick-Lawrence/dp/0900187190\n\nhttp://www.friendsofcoleridge.com/MembersOnly/Dunning.html\n\nhttp://www.cornish-mining.org.uk/delving-deeper/mining-somerset\n\nhttp://archaeologydataservice.ac.uk/archiveDS/archiveDownload?t=arch-1416-1/dissemination/pdf/9781848021648_Quantocks_all.pdf\n\nhttp://www.iomfhs.im/resources/lawsons/v2/spouses.pdf\n\nhttp://petergardner.info/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/Samuel-Grose-1793-1866.pdf\n\nhttps://navsbooks.wordpress.com/2017/01/30/samuel-grose/\n\nNote: Any errors or omissions in this post are unintentional and might be my mistakes, or transcription errors.
