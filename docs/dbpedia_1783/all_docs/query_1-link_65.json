        "text": "Why did I read this strange book from 1992 that is a lot about baseball? Because I couldn’t fit my latest book by an author whose surname begins with a D onto the TBR shelf, and removing this one made room for the new one. I didn’t understand a word about the baseball, and before long started skipping huge chunks of a metaphor that seems overdone to me, but I rather liked the picture that emerged of an underprivileged American life that seems rich and fulfilling all the same.\n\nFeminists beware: this story is about a family of six children, but the two girls are definitely an afterthought, perhaps because they don’t play baseball. (Or do they?) Well, fair enough, the book is called The Brothers K, so we can’t say we weren’t warned…\n\nThe title is a clear allusion to Dostoyevsky’s The Brothers Karamazov which I read a million years ago when I was far too young to make anything of it. I needed Wikipedia to remind me about its plot:\n\nComposed of 12 “books”, the novel tells the story of the novice Alyosha Karamazov, the non-believer Ivan Karamazov and the soldier Dmitri Karamazov. The first books introduce the Karamazovs. The main plot is the death of their father Fyodor, while other parts are philosophical and religious arguments by Father Zosima to Alyosha.\n\nand its themes:\n\nThe Brothers Karamazov is a passionate philosophical novel set in 19th-century Russia, that enters deeply into the ethical debates of God, free will, and morality. It is a spiritual drama of moral struggles concerning faith, doubt, judgment, and reason, set against a modernizing Russia, with a plot which revolves around the subject of patricide.\n\nWell, The Brothers K is a modern American version with four brothers instead of three, (plus two largely irrelevant sisters as noted before) and the patricide is more a case of a father’s spirit being killed by the way his ambition and talent as a baseball player is compromised by his circumstances. His life is one of drudgery as one of the working poor, made more unbearable by his wife who is a fanatical Seventh Day Adventist.\n\nThis fanaticism is the source of a split within the family, and the Vietnam War is the catalyst for its tragedy. Three of the brothers reject Adventism, but Irwin remains devout into adulthood. There is irony, then, in that of them all, he is the only one who gets drafted, because apparently (who knew??) Adventists were automatically granted the status of Conscientious Objectors and were exempted from the draft. Brothers Peter and Kade win university scholarships to achieve endless deferrals, and Everett flits over the border to Canada, but the fanatical Elders at the church take out their resentment of the unbelieving brothers by rejecting poor dopey Irwin as one of their own, partly also because he has taken a vulnerable young woman under his wing and (you guessed it) got her pregnant. So expelled from his religious community, off Irwin goes to be a grunt in Uncle Sam’s army, where it turns out that, well, yes, he really is a conscientious objector and that causes enormous trouble with long-lasting effects.\n\nOnce I sifted out all the stuff about baseball (and there really is far too much of it) it’s a satisfying novel. Those of us of a certain age who lived through the Vietnam Years will connect with the family conflicts, though in the novel it’s not really about the morality of the war per se, but rather about conscription. Everett, who is the most radical of the brothers, is portrayed as a man more in love with his own profile as a radical than as one with genuine objections to the war, and I bristled a bit at that because I admire the generation of Australian radicals who led the Moratorium movement here and stopped the war – in a way that successive generations have not bothered to do over Iraq or anywhere else.\n\nBut the portrayal of the impact on family is perceptive. Everett chooses radicalism while Peter chooses a monastic pursuit of other religions, and Kade the narrator feels a sense of loss:\n\n… it wasn’t the choice between rebellion and renunciation that generated that comfortlessness: it was an unnameable sadness that filled both halves – a loss of unity, of solidarity, or brotherhood. Something precious was being taken from us, or squandered by us. And neither Everett the Revolutionary nor Peter the Monk was taking even a moment to look back and mourn for it. But to me…\n\nTo me it felt as though two old and intimate friends, after sixteen years spent hiking shoulder to shoulder, had come to a fork in the trail, and without even noticing had taken different paths. When they first looked up and saw what had happened, they were not at all far apart: they could still speak quietly to each other, could still see each other perfectly well. But they just kept going! All those years spent side by side, yet they didn’t hesitate, didn’t wave goodbye, didn’t even acknowledge that they’d parted. Somehow this chilled me to the heart. (p. 207)\n\nThe representation of religious fanaticism is also excellent, and with a little tweaking, still highly relevant to the current menace of fundamentalism of other varieties as well:\n\nIn a head-on collision with Fanatics, the real problem is always the same: how can we possibly behave decently toward people so arrogantly ignorant that they believe, first, that they possess Christ’s power to bestow salvation, second, that forcing us to memorise and regurgitate a few of their favourite Bible phrases and attend their church is that salvation, and third, that any discomfort, frustration, anger or disagreement we express in the face of their moronic barrages is due not to their astounding effrontery but to our sinfulness? (p.227)\n\nIndeed.\n\nThe Brothers K is 640+ pages long (less if you skip the baseball) but there is much more to it than I have outlined here and I’m not sorry I bought it now…"
