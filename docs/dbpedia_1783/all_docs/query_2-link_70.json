        "text": "Oklahoma City will pay $331,000 to settle lawsuits filed by the families of three young women who were killed and one who was seriously injured last year in a car crash involving a city police officer.\n\nLast week, the city council approved settlements with the families of two victims, sisters Dorothea and Kristen Delaney, and with the survivor, Michelle Grose.\n\nRobert and Marge Delaney will receive $95,000 for Kristen's death and $50,000 for that of Dorothea, the driver of the car. Kristen was a 22-year-old part-time college student when she died. Dorothea was 18.\n\nGrose, who was 18 at the time of the accident, will receive $93,000.\n\nLast month, the council approved a $93,000 settlement with Madelyn Kay Tedford, mother of Douglass High School student Charise Nicole Smith, another crash victim.\n\nThe accident occurred Jan. 6, 1985, when a police cruiser driven by officer Patrick Byrne slammed into a Ford Fiesta driven by Dorothea Delaney.\n\nPolice reported the accident occurred about 1 a.m. at NW 23 and Indiana as Byrne was going to set up surveillance on a car used in an armed robbery in the area.\n\nDelaney's car was trying to turn left onto Indiana from the westbound lanes of NW 23 when it was was struck broadside and flipped several times.\n\nCity attorney Robert Allen said the settlement amounts are near the $100,000 maximum for which the city is liable under state tort law.\n\n\"It has to be a pretty horrendous set of circumstances for me to recommend an amount that high,\" Allen said.\n\nStill, he said, \"if it was your 18-year-old, you'd feel the city was being kind of chintzy about it.\"\n\nGrose's attorney, David Cheek, said, \"Under all the circumstances, that's a fair settlement. I'm glad to hear they approved it.\"\n\nA memo from Allen to council members said Grose suffered a compound fracture of a leg and received numerous cuts and bruises. She spent a week in intensive care and was hospitalized 20 days, he said.\n\nCheek said Grose has recovered nicely, though she will have some permanent scarring and disability. She missed about a year of school but now has returned to the University of Oklahoma, he said.\n\nCheek said other claims involving the accident are still pending.\n\nThe attorney for the Delaneys could not be reached for comment.\n\nAllen's report to the council said that although some evidence indicates Dorothea Delaney's negligence may have been the accident's major cause, her alleged fault would not prevent a jury from awarding to her and the passengers a judgment based on other evidence.\n\nAfter the accident, a review board issued Byrne a written reprimand for the speed at which he was driving at the time of the accident, police said. Byrne was not operating the squad car's emergency lights or siren at the time, police reported.\n\nA medical examiner's report stated Dorothea Delaney was intoxicated when she died.
