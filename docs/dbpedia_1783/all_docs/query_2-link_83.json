        "text": "Well-known Anglo-American song\n\nFor other uses, see Yankee Doodle (disambiguation).\n\n\"Yankee Doodle\"SongPublished1780s\n\n\"Yankee Doodle\" is a traditional song and nursery rhyme, the early versions of which predate the Seven Years' War and American Revolutionary War.[1] It is often sung patriotically in the United States today. It is the state song of the U.S. state of Connecticut.[2] Its Roud Folk Song Index number is 4501.\n\nOrigin\n\n[edit]\n\nThe tune of \"Yankee Doodle\" is thought to be much older than the lyrics, being well known across western Europe, including England, France, Netherlands, Hungary, and Spain.[3] The melody of the song may have originated from an Irish tune \"All the way to Galway\" in which the second strain is identical to Yankee Doodle.[4][5] The earliest words of \"Yankee Doodle\" came from a Middle Dutch harvest song which is thought to have followed the same tune, possibly dating back as far as 15th-century Holland.[6][7] It contained mostly nonsense words in English and Dutch: \"Yanker, didel, doodle down, Diddle, dudel, lanther, Yanke viver, voover vown, Botermilk und tanther.\"[3][8][7] Farm laborers in Holland were paid \"as much buttermilk (Botermelk) as they could drink, and a tenth (tanther) of the grain\".[8][7]\n\nThe term Doodle first appeared in English in the early 17th century[9] and is thought to be derived from the Low German dudel, meaning \"playing music badly\", or Dödel, meaning \"fool\" or \"simpleton\". The Macaroni wig was an extreme fashion in the 1770s and became slang for being a fop.[10] Dandies were men who placed particular importance upon physical appearance, refined language, and leisure hobbies. A self-made dandy was a British middle-class man who impersonated an aristocratic lifestyle. They notably wore silk strip cloth, stuck feathers in their hats, and carried two pocket watches with chains—\"one to tell what time it was and the other to tell what time it was not\".[11]\n\nThe macaroni wig was an example of such Rococo dandy fashion, popular in elite circles in Western Europe and much mocked in the London press. The term macaroni was used to describe a fashionable man who dressed and spoke in an outlandishly affected and effeminate manner. The term pejoratively referred to a man who \"exceeded the ordinary bounds of fashion\"[12] in terms of clothes, fastidious eating, and gambling.\n\nIn British conversation, the term \"Yankee doodle dandy\" implied unsophisticated misappropriation of upper-class fashion, as though simply sticking a feather in one's cap would transform the wearer into a noble.[13] Peter McNeil, a professor of fashion studies, claims that the British were insinuating that the colonists were lower-class men who lacked masculinity, emphasizing that the American men were womanly.[14]\n\nEarly versions\n\n[edit]\n\nThe song was a pre-Revolutionary War song originally sung by British military officers to mock the disheveled, disorganized colonial \"Yankees\" with whom they served in the French and Indian War. It was written at Fort Crailo around 1755 by British Army surgeon Richard Shuckburgh while campaigning in Rensselaer, New York.[15] The British troops sang it to mock their stereotype of the American soldier as a Yankee simpleton who thought that he was stylish if he simply stuck a feather in his cap.[1] It was also popular among the Americans as a song of defiance,[1] and they added verses to it that mocked the British and hailed George Washington as the Commander of the Continental army. By 1781, \"Yankee Doodle\" had turned from being an insult to being a song of national pride.[16][17]\n\nAccording to one account, Shuckburgh wrote the original lyrics after seeing the appearance of Colonial troops under Colonel Thomas Fitch, the son of Connecticut Governor Thomas Fitch.[18] According to the Online Etymology Dictionary, \"the current version seems to have been written in 1776 by Edward Bangs, a Harvard sophomore who also was a Minuteman.\"[15] He wrote a ballad with 15 verses which circulated in Boston and surrounding towns in 1775 or 1776.[19]\n\nA bill was introduced to the House of Representatives on July 25, 1999,[20] recognizing Billerica, Massachusetts, as \"America's Yankee Doodle Town\". After the Battle of Lexington and Concord, a Boston newspaper reported:\n\nUpon their return to Boston [pursued by the Minutemen], one [Briton] asked his brother officer how he liked the tune now, – \"Dang them\", returned he, \"they made us dance it till we were tired\" – since which Yankee Doodle sounds less sweet to their ears.\n\nThe earliest known version of the lyrics comes from 1755 or 1758 (the date of origin is disputed):[21]\n\nBrother Ephraim sold his Cow\n\nAnd bought him a Commission;\n\nAnd then he went to Canada\n\nTo fight for the Nation;\n\nBut when Ephraim he came home\n\nHe proved an arrant Coward,\n\nHe wouldn't fight the Frenchmen there\n\nFor fear of being devoured.\n\nThe sheet music which accompanies these lyrics reads, \"The Words to be Sung through the Nose, & in the West Country drawl & dialect.\" The tune also appeared in 1762 in one of America's first comic operas The Disappointment, with bawdy lyrics about the search for Blackbeard's buried treasure by a team from Philadelphia.[22] An alternate verse that the British are said to have marched to is attributed to an incident involving Thomas Ditson of Billerica, Massachusetts.[23] Ditson attempted to purchase a Brown Bess musket from a British soldier in the 47th Regiment of Foot in Boston in March 1775; after a group of the soldier's comrades spotted the transaction as it was occurring, they tarred and feathered Ditson in order to prevent any such illegal purchases from happening in the future. Ditson eventually managed to secure a musket and fought at the Battles of Lexington and Concord.[24] For this reason, the town of Billerica is called the home of \"Yankee Doodle\":[25][26]\n\nYankee Doodle came to town,\n\nFor to buy a firelock,\n\nWe will tar and feather him,\n\nAnd so we will John Hancock.\n\nAnother pro-British set of lyrics believed to have used the tune was published in June 1775 following the Battle of Bunker Hill:[27]\n\nThe seventeen of June, at Break of Day,\n\nThe Rebels they supriz'd us,\n\nWith their strong Works, which they'd thrown up,\n\nTo burn the Town and drive us.\n\n\"Yankee Doodle\" was played at the British surrender at Saratoga in 1777.[28] A variant is preserved in the 1810 edition of Gammer Gurton's Garland: Or, The Nursery Parnassus, collected by Francis Douce, now in the Bodleian Library, Oxford:\n\nYankey Doodle came to town,\n\nHow do you think they serv'd him?\n\nOne took his bag, another his scrip,\n\nThe quicker for to starve him.[29]\n\nFull version\n\n[edit]\n\nThe Spirit of '76 (aka Yankee Doodle)ArtistArchibald WillardYearc. 1875TypeOilDimensions61 cm × 45 cm (24 in × 18 in)LocationUnited States Department of State\n\nThe full version of the song as it is known today:[30][31]\n\nYankee Doodle went to town\n\nA-riding on a pony,\n\nStuck a feather in his cap\n\nAnd called it macaroni.\n\n[Chorus]\n\nYankee Doodle keep it up,\n\nYankee Doodle dandy,\n\nMind the music and the step,\n\nAnd with the girls be handy.\n\nFather and I went down to camp,\n\nAlong with Captain Gooding,[a]\n\nAnd there we saw the men and boys\n\nAs thick as hasty pudding.\n\n[Chorus]\n\nAnd there we saw a thousand men\n\nAs rich as Squire David,\n\nAnd what they wasted every day,\n\nI wish it could be savèd.\n\n[Chorus]\n\nThe 'lasses they eat every day,\n\nWould keep a house a winter;\n\nThey have so much, that I'll be bound,\n\nThey eat it when they've a mind to.\n\n[Chorus]\n\nAnd there I see a swamping[b] gun\n\nLarge as a log of maple,\n\nUpon a deuced little cart,\n\nA load for father's cattle.\n\n[Chorus]\n\nAnd every time they shoot it off,\n\nIt takes a horn of powder,\n\nAnd makes a noise like father's gun,\n\nOnly a nation[c] louder.\n\n[Chorus]\n\nI went as nigh to one myself\n\nAs 'Siah's underpinning;\n\nAnd father went as nigh again,\n\nI thought the deuce was in him.\n\n[Chorus]\n\nCousin Simon grew so bold,\n\nI thought he would have cocked it;\n\nIt scared me so I shrinked it off\n\nAnd hung by father's pocket.\n\n[Chorus]\n\nAnd Cap'n Davis had a gun,\n\nHe kind of clapt his hand on't\n\nAnd stuck a crooked stabbing iron\n\nUpon the little end on't\n\n[Chorus]\n\nAnd there I see a pumpkin shell\n\nAs big as mother's basin,\n\nAnd every time they touched it off\n\nThey scampered like the nation.\n\n[Chorus]\n\nI see a little barrel too,\n\nThe heads were made of leather;\n\nThey knocked on it with little clubs\n\nAnd called the folks together.\n\n[Chorus]\n\nAnd there was Cap'n Washington,\n\nAnd gentle folks about him;\n\nThey say he's grown so 'tarnal proud\n\nHe will not ride without 'em.\n\n[Chorus]\n\nHe got him on his meeting clothes,\n\nUpon a slapping stallion;\n\nHe sat the world along in rows,\n\nIn hundreds and in millions.\n\n[Chorus]\n\nThe flaming ribbons in his hat,\n\nThey looked so tearing fine, ah,\n\nI wanted dreadfully to get\n\nTo give to my Jemima.\n\n[Chorus]\n\nI see another snarl of men\n\nA-digging graves, they told me,\n\nSo 'tarnal long, so 'tarnal deep,\n\nThey 'tended they should hold me.\n\n[Chorus]\n\nIt scared me so, I hooked it off,\n\nNor stopped, as I remember,\n\nNor turned about till I got home,\n\nLocked up in mother's chamber.\n\n[Chorus]\n\nTune\n\n[edit]\n\nThe tune shares with the English language nursery rhymes \"Simple Simon\", \"Jack and Jill\", and \"Lucy Locket\". It also inspired the theme tune for the children's television series, Barney & the Backyard Gang, Barney & Friends, and the 1960s US cartoon series Roger Ramjet. Danish band Toy-Box sampled the tune in their song \"E.T\".\n\nNotable renditions\n\n[edit]\n\nDuring the aftermath of the Siege of Yorktown, the surrendering British soldiers looked only at the French soldiers present, refusing to pay the American soldiers any heed. Marquis de Lafayette was outraged and ordered his band to play \"Yankee Doodle\" in response to taunt the British.[35] Upon doing so, the British soldiers at last looked upon the Americans.[36]\n\nThe US state broadcaster Voice of America uses this tune as their interval signal.[37]\n\nSee also\n\n[edit]\n\nYankee Doodle Dandy, 1942 musical film\n\n\"The Yankee Doodle Boy\", 1904 song\n\nNotes\n\n[edit]\n\nReferences\n\n[edit]\n\nFurther reading\n\n[edit]\n\nBobrick, Benson (1997).
