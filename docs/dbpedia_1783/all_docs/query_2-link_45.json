        "text": "It was published by Francis Grose.\n\nFrancis Gorse’s ‘classical Dictionary of the Vulgar Tongue’ was first published in 1785\n\nHe also published a Provincial Glossary, with a Collection of Local Proverbs, and Popular Superstitions in 1787\n\nGrose produced slang dictionaries as they gave an unusual vivid picture of the speech of the day which would not normally find inclusion in standard English\n\nFrancis Grose had a descriptivist attitude as he wanted to explore non-standard English which is why he and his assistant Tom Cocking took midnight walks though London, picking up slang terms in slums and adding them to their ‘knowledge-box’\n\n‘The Vulgar Tongue’ was recognised throughout the 19th century as one of the most important collections of slang in the English language, and it would strongly influence later dictionaries of this kind."
