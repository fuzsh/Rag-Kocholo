        "text": "Because I cover parenting for work, I tend to avoid the subject in the media I consume for pleasure. On social media, a lot of the mom content is aspirational in a way that I find either boring, didactic or passive aggressive. Sometimes all three. Hey Mama! I make these beautiful and elaborate bento box lunches for my children every day, but we are all so busy and I totally understand if you don’t love your children enough to cut their kiwis into tiny flowers.\n\nWhen it comes to TV and movies, I usually want to escape my day-to-day life and watch grown women throw wine at each other and/or fall asleep to “Forensic Files.” I don’t want to watch parents struggling through bedtime. I live that.\n\nBut lately there has been some parenting-related media that I really love, and so I want to recommend it.\n\nFirst, there’s “Nuclear Family,” a three-part documentary series on HBO Max. The filmmaker Ry Russo-Young explores a childhood court battle that deeply affected her and her family. She is the daughter of a lesbian couple who used known sperm donors in the early ’80s. Russo-Young’s mothers included her donor in their lives, and ultimately he sued to gain legal standing as Russo-Young’s father.\n\nThe series is sensitive and illuminating, trying hard to show every person’s perspective with grace and understanding. And it demonstrates how fiercely Russo-Young’s mothers had to fight to become parents in the first place as a gay couple more than 40 years ago.\n\nSecond, I want to recommend some of my favorite TikTok and Instagram parents, because I spend way too much time on both of those platforms. My colleague Farah Miller always says the way to get your kids to stay off social media is to be really into it, so I’m hoping that proves true, since we know that image-based social media can be a garbage fire for some teenage girls.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
