However, in the context of Irish descent, the surname Gross is not commonly associated with Irish heritage. Irish surnames generally have Celtic origins and are derived from Gaelic language and culture. Common Irish surnames include O'Connor, Murphy, and Fitzgerald. The surname Gross is more commonly found in German-speaking countries, where it is derived from the German word \"gross\" meaning \"big\" or \"tall.\" It is likely that individuals with the surname Gross of Irish descent either have ancestors who emigrated from Germany or have ancestors who were given the surname for other reasons, such as intermarriage or adoption. The history of the surname Gross in Irish descent is therefore limited and does not have deep roots in Irish heritage. It is important to note that surnames can change or adapt over time, and individuals with the surname Gross of Irish descent may have a unique family history that influenced the adoption of this particular surname.
