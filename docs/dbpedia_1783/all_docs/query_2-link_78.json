PREFACE TO TBI FIRST EDITION The great approbation with which so polite a nation as France has received the Satirical and Burlesque Dictionary of Monsieur Le Roux, testified by the several editions it has gone through, will, it is hoped, apologize for an attempt to compile an English Dictionary on a sknilar plan ; our language being at least as co- pious as the French^ and as capable of fhe witty equivoque ; besidea which, the freedom of thought and speech arising from, and privtl^ed by,, our constitution, gives a force and poignancy to the expressions of our common people, Qot to be vi PREFACE TO THE found under arbitrary govemtnente, where the ebullitions of vulgar wit are checked by the fear of the bastinado^ or of a lodgii^ duruig pleasure in some gaol or castle. The many vulgar allusicjq^ apd cant expres- sions that so frequently occur in our common conversation and periodicAl publications, make a work of this kind extremely useful, if not ab- solutely neoeissliry, . tot bnl^f t6 ilbfefgners, but even to natives resident at a distance from the Metropolis, or who do not mix in the busy world : without some such help, they might hunt through all the ordinary Dictionaries, from Alpha toOto€ga, iii^se&nrch of the^vrikds,; '' Mack k^, V laitde dtuit, '^j pHomb^-malhoigeror, nip 'eheei^e, ^^•d^ies] aadt'ithe.naw drop^'^ althougt^ llbese ate. all terms <:af> l^ell-known import/'ai' tilMew- market, JBiccllQIige-aUey^ the Gityi -the Pwraide, iliVifa{>ppg,. wd Neli^gate^ n, -: .' > ; .

Respecting the first, that is, tite canlug lan^ guage, take the account given of its ori^, fund the catastrophe of its institotor, fcom Mr. Har- rison's Description of England, prefixed to Hd- iingshead's Chronicle; where, treatii^ of beg- gars, gypsies, &c. he says, ^' It is not yet fifty ^' years sith this trade began : but how it h^h '' prospered sithens that time, it is easy to judge ; *' for they are now supposed, of one sexe and «< another, to amount unto above ten thousand ^* persons, as , I have harde reported* Mqw- ^ over, in counterfeiting the Egyptian roges, they ^* have devised a language among themselves^ €t l€ tiii PREFACE TO THE « ^* which they name Cantiiig<^ but^athers Pedkrci ^ French, a speache compact thirty yean sosce <'^ <rf English, and a great i^amber of odde wiDrds of their own devising, without all ordw or reason; and yet such it is, as. none but *< themselves aite able to understand.

The favouraUe reception with which this Book was honoured by the Public has encouraged the Editor to present a second edition^ more cor- rectly arranged, and very considerably enlarged.

In .,\"■•»'• the jpresent edition, for myself, I have strongly toc>re-echo the sentiments of the former editors, ♦ . namely, that t have neglected no opportunity of excluding indelicate phrases, which might have been adopted by my predecessors, nor of b 2 / • 4 XX PREFACE TO THE softening down others, where propriety pointed out such a course as not only necessary, but, perhaps, essential to render palatable this Classical Dic- tionary OF THE Vulgar Tongue. At all events, if any apology is requisite, the subject in question must be Yievyed j^ b, cwipilation€( sentences col- lected from the lower walks of society, in which a scrupulous attention to nicety of expression is neither expec(;pd 4or looked for.;, the persons al- luded to, from, whose lips they have escaped, not being ^^ partiklar as to a shad^^ in colouring their lingOj or in displaying their taste for ervdititm — their only object being effect. The above argument has been so well h^mdlecl * ■ • ^ \\ . by a celebrated poet,* and is so a-^cjpa^, tlj9^tj I cannot elucidate the subjj^ct better th w Ibj quoting his remarks: — ** With respect to that ,. . ^ ■^. . . ■ -• - ■ . •. ^' peculiar language, called , JFTci^A or St. Gilfis^s '^ Greeks in which Mr. Crib's Memorial ai:id the *' ,other articles in the present volume are written. \" I beg to trouble the reader with a few observa^ ^^ tions.

THIRD EDITION. xxi \" cipher of the diplomatists, for purposes of ^' secrecy, and as a means of eluding the vigi- ** lance of a certain class of persons, called, ** ftashicSj Traps, or in common language, Bow- ^* Street-Officers, it is subject of course to con- ** tinual change, and is perpetually either aher- « ing the meaning of old words, or adding new *' ones, according as the great object, secrecy, '^ renders it prudent to have recourse to such in- novations. In this respect, also, it resembles the cryptography of kings and ambassadors, who, by a continual change of cipher, contrive to baffle the inquisitiveness of the enemy. But, <' notwithstanding the Protean nature of the JFfsuih or Cant language, the greater part of ■ its vocabulary has remained unchanged for centuries, and many of the words used by the Canting Beggars in Beaumont and Fletcher, and the Gipsies in Ben Jonson's Masque, are '< still to be heard among the Crnostics of Dyot- *^ street and Tqthill-fields.

Most of the Cant phrases in Head's English Bogue, which was published, I believe, in 1666i, would be intelligible to a Greek of the present day ; though it must be confessed ^' that the Songs which both he and I>ekker have '' given would puzzle even th^t ' Graie^ gentis \" * decus,' Caleb Baldwin, himself.

By his. father he was left an independent fortane, which he was not of a disposition to add to or even to preserve. He early entered into the Surrey Militia, of which he became adjutant and paymaster; but so much had dissipation taken possession of him, that, in a situation which, above all others, required attention, he was so careless as to XXX BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH OF hare for some time (as he used pleasaatly to tell) only two books of accounts, viz. his right and left hand pockets. In the one he received^ and from the other paid ; and this^ too, with a want of circnmspection which may be readily supposed from such a mode of book-keeping.

The next year he added two more volumes to his Englirii 4 Views, in which he included the islands of Guernsey and Jersey^ which were completed in 1787. This work, which was executed with accuracy and elegance, soon became a favourite with the public \"at large, as well as with professed antiquaries, ifrom the neatness of the em- bellishments,' and the succinct manner in which he con- veyed his information, and, therefore, answered his most sanguine expectations ; and, from the time he began it to the end of his life, he continued without intermission to publish various works, generally to the advantage of his literary reputation, and almost always to the benefit rfhi.^.^ Hi. w«.d good h».»„ .»»*,: abundi^nt source of satisfaction to himself and entertain- I.I . .^.j .

Captain Grose was also a great ob- server of men and manners, and possessed a fine and ac-. carate taste for painting. Dr. Griffiths, Arthur Murphy, Mr. Quick, the celebrated icomedian, &c. Sec. were among the persons who frequently visited the Captain a Hooper's, where they discussed the literary topics of the day. The Captain had a funny fellow, of the name of Tom Coding, one after his own hearty as an amanuensis, and who was also a draughtsman of considerable merit. He was of great service to the Captain in his Tour through England, Ireland, and Scotland. In the latter place. Captain Grose became intimately acquainted with Robert Bums, the poet, who thus describes the Antiquarian: -— If in your bounds ye chance to light Upon a fine, fat, fodgel wight O' stature short, but genius bright, That's he, mark weel— And wow ! he has an unco slight O' cauk and keel.
