Beginning in 1868 marriage licenses were created instead. Since 1851 marriages were also recorded in marriage registers. For an example of a bond, click here.&nbsp For an example of a license, click here.&nbsp For an example of a register, click here.&nbsp Note that the register does not provide all of the information that is recorded on the license. The amount of data recorded on licenses also varies across time. The Society has paper copies of most Rutherford County marriage licenses from about 1868 to 1961. Copies of licenses in our collection may be obtained from the Society. Call or write for details. To find out if a license for which you are searching existed, you can check our index of all Rutherford marriage bonds and licenses from 1779 to 1961. Click here. It should be noted that a few marriage licenses are missing. However, they are still listed in the index since the marriages are recorded in the marriage registers. We also have microfilm of Rutherford County marriage bonds from 1779 to 1868.\n\nThe Society's Rutherford County Death Certificate Collection\n\nDeath certificates began to be recorded in small towns in Rutherford County in 1909, but death certificates for the entire county were not recorded until about 1914. The Society has paper copies of the county copies of Rutherford County death certificates through 1954. The information on the county copies will in most cases match that on the state copies. However, there are differences occasionally. Also, if the state copy is difficult to read, the county copy may not be (and vice-versa). Copies of the county copies in our collection may be obtained from the Society. Call or write for details. To find out if a death certificate for which you are searching exists, you can check our index of all Rutherford County copies of death certificates from 1909 to 1954. Click here.\n\nThe Western Boundary of Tryon County\n\nFollowing the 1763 end of the French and Indian War efforts were made to firmly establish the boundary between Indian lands and the western parts of North Carolina and South Carolina. &nbsp Land between the Catawba and Broad Rivers was ceded to North Carolina by the Catawba Indians in 1763 by the Treaty of Augusta (Georgia). &nbsp Based upon an agreement of 20 October 1765 the Treaty of Fort Prince George in 1766 established the boundary between Indian lands and South Carolina (as far north as Reedy River since at the time lands northeast of there were claimed by North Carolina). &nbsp North Carolina began serious efforts to establish its western boundary with the Cherokee Indians in 1767 and the boundary was ratified 14 October 1768 by the Treaty of Hard Labor. &nbsp The essential documents of Governor Tryon may be viewed at the following links to his papers at the N. C. Archives (links will open in new tabs or windows). &nbsp The western boundary agreement may be viewed on five frames here. &nbsp The 16 July 1767 proclamation by King George III to Governor Tryon which includes prohibition of settlements on the Indian lands may be viewed on two frames here. &nbsp Governor Tryon's proclamation to the colony with the same date may be viewed on two frames here. &nbsp The 14 October 1768 Treaty of Hard Labor may be viewed on five frames here. &nbsp Not by coincidence, a new county was created out of the western part of Mecklenburg County shortly after the Treaty of Hard Labor and was named for Governor William Tryon. &nbsp For all practical purposes the western boundary of Tryon County was extended farther west as part of the Treaty of Long Island (Holston River) 20 July 1777 by which the Cherokee Indians ceded lands east of the Blue Ridge Mountains to North Carolina. &nbsp This is reflected in the description of Rutherford County made in the bill to divide Tryon County (see below).\n\nThe Northern Boundary of Tryon County\n\nBy the Carolina Charter of 24 March 1663 Charles II awarded to eight of his supporters land from Virginia to Florida. &nbsp Seven of the eight Lords Proprietors sold their interests back to the Crown 25 July 1729. &nbsp One proprietor John, Lord Carteret, later Earl of Granville, refused to surrender his interest. &nbsp By the recommendation of a special commission, on 6 December 1743 it was decided that Lord Carteret's lands would be those south of the Virginia boundary extending south to 35 degrees 34 minutes north latitude. &nbsp This huge tract of land became known as the Granville District. &nbsp When Rowan County was created out of Anson County in 1753 its southern boundary coincided with the southern boundary of the Granville District. &nbsp Land south of that Rowan County boundary west of the Catawba River became part of Mecklenburg County when it was created out of Anson County 1 February 1763. &nbsp This resulted in 1769 in the northern boundary of newly created Tryon County being part of the southern line of the Granville District as well. &nbsp Consequently a small portion of present Lincoln, Cleveland, and Rutherford Counties was in Rowan County in the Granville District and not part of Tryon County.\n\nThe Eastern Boundary of Tryon County\n\nThe act creating Tryon County designated its eastern boundary to be the Catawba River extending south to the boundary with South Carolina. &nbsp In 1764 that South Carolina boundary east of the Catawba River had been determined to be the line including the present southern boundaries of the counties of Anson and Union (NC). &nbsp Therefore the eastern boundary of Tryon County extended only as far south as an area near the southeast corner of present York County, South Carolina. &nbsp Assertions that the 1764 line should have been much farther north resulted in the 1772 agreement giving South Carolina the part of Tryon County south of the present NC-SC boundary and known at the time as the New Acquisition.\n\nThe Southern Boundary of Tryon County\n\nWith no specification being made of its southern boundary, by default it became what was then an as-yet-undetermined South Carolina boundary west of the Catawba River. &nbsp That boundary would have extended in some manner from the southern end of the western boundary on the Reedy River to the southern end of the eastern boundary on the Catawba River. &nbsp It would be problematic for settlers in the southern section of Tryon County to know whether they resided in North Carolina or South Carolina. &nbsp If they considered themselves residents of South Carolina they would have been residents of Craven County in that state and part of either Camden District or 96 District (even though they may not have been).\n\nThe Tryon County Charter\n\nAt the N. C. Archives in Secretary of State series S. S. XVIII (Recordkeeping, Miscellaneous), formerly in S. S. 906 (Miscellaneous Papers), is the Charter for Tryon County dated 26 June 1769, giving inhabitants of the county full Power and absolute Authority as heretofore accustomed and directed within our said Province to Name and Elect and send two Representatives for the said County to be present, set and Vote in the House of Assembly of our said Province of North Carolina ... &nbsp For an image of the charter click here.&nbsp See the August 2012 Bulletin, p. 135.\n\nItems Relating to Tryon County in the N.
