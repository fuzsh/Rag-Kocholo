The history of the last name Grose

The surname Grose is of German origin, derived from the Middle High German word "gros" meaning "great" or "large." It likely originated as a nickname for someone of a large stature or impressive size. The name is first recorded in the 13th century in various regions of Germany, particularly in the southern and central areas.

One of the earliest documented instances of the surname Grose can be found in the Bern Shilling Book, a medieval tax record from the city of Bern, Switzerland, dating back to 1288. The name is recorded as "Grosse," which was a common spelling variation at the time.

In the 14th century, the Grose surname began to appear in other parts of Europe, including England and France. It is mentioned in the Hundred Rolls of Cambridgeshire, a census-like record from 1279, where it is spelled as "Grosse." This suggests that the name had spread to England by that time, possibly through German immigrants or travelers.

One of the earliest recorded individuals with the surname Grose was Hans Grose, a German merchant and trader who lived in the late 15th century. He is mentioned in various historical documents from the city of Nuremberg, where he conducted business dealings.

In the 16th century, the Grose surname gained prominence in England, particularly in the county of Norfolk. Notable individuals from this era include William Grose (1510-1587), a wealthy landowner and member of the gentry, and his son, Thomas Grose (1548-1621), who served as a Member of Parliament for the borough of Castle Rising.

Another significant figure was Francis Grose (1731-1791), an English antiquary and writer known for his works on antiquities and folklore. He is best remembered for his publication "The Antiquities of England and Wales," a comprehensive survey of historical sites and monuments.

In the 19th century, the Grose surname continued to be found across various parts of Europe and in the United States. One notable individual was Benjamin Grose (1809-1875), an American politician who served as a member of the United States House of Representatives from Pennsylvania.
