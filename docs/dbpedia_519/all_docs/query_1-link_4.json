        "text": "The Federal Republic of Scanelandia (Swedish: Förbundsrepubliken Skåneland) commonly called Scania or Scanelandia, is a Parliamentary Federal Republic in Northern Europe. It is bordered on the north by the Kingdom of Sweden, on the south and east by the Baltic Sea and on the west by Denmark via the Öresund bridge. Scania covers 19 254 square kilometers and has has an estimated population of 1 895 081. Scania comprises of 4 Counties and 45 Municipalities.\n\nScania may be small but it has a large population on a small area. It's one of the largest sugar beats, Rey and rape producing area in Northern Europe. The economy is modest but growing rapidly, the reason was after the Socialist years (1945-1989). where the economy greatly decreased with economic output decreased with 250%. Scania has now one of biggest military in Scandinavia and is now a part of several international organizations like the European Union, United Nations, NATO, InterPol, Nordic Council, OECD, European Council and many more. The country is very industrialized with a big export sector with the biggest export being automotive, tech and medicine industry.\n\nThe names Scania (Swedish: Skåne) and Scandinavia are considered to have the same etymology and the southernmost tip of what is today the Scandinavian Peninsula, the area was called Scania by the Romans and thought to be an island. The actual etymology of the word remains dubious and has long been a matter of debate among scholars. The name is possibly derived from the Germanic root *Skaðin-awjã, which appears in Old Norse as Skáney. According to some scholars, the Germanic stem can be reconstructed as *Skaðan- meaning \"danger\" or \"damage\" (English scathing, German Schaden, Swedish skada). Skanör in Scania, with its long Falsterbo reef, has the same stem (skan) combined with -ör, which means \"sandbanks\".\n\nThe name Skåneland is first recorded in print in the year 1719. It is unclear what area is meant. Later (1751) Carl Linnaeus uses it, meaning the province of Scania. The modern use of the denomination as a short form for De Skånska Landskapen (\"The Scanian provinces\"), for the combined area of the provinces of Blekinge, Halland and Scania, was launched by the Swedish historian and Scandinavist Martin Weibull (1835-1902) in Samlingar till Skånes historia (Föreningen för Skånes Fornminnen och Historia. published 1868-73 in six volumes) in order to illuminate the common Danish history of Scania, Blekinge, and Halland.\n\nWeibull used the term as a combined term for the four provinces where the Scanian Law had its jurisdiction, as well as the area of the archdiocese of Lund until the Reformation in 1536, later the Danish Lutheran diocese of Lund. This form of Skåneland was then used in the regional historical periodical Historisk tidskrift för Skåneland, beginning in 1901, published by Martin's son, Lauritz Weibull. In 1878 when they declared independence from Sweden and Denmark the name was chosen as a way to emphasize their unique culture and identity apart from Sweden and Denmark.\n\nThe standard way to refer to a citizen of Scania is as a \"Scanian.\"\n\nPopulation and settlements\n\nThe earliest settlements of people was found in the area during the Ice Age when it slowly shifted, at that time the area of Scania was either under ice or a freezing tundra where reindeers lived. The earliest humans came here around 9 000 years ago, the climate in the area shifted very rapidly and the area wasn't permanently settled until the beginning of the agricultural revolution.\n\nThe earliest Danish historians, writing in the 12th and 13th century, believed that the Danish Kingdom had existed since king Dan, in a distant past. Eighth century sources mention the existence of Denmark as a kingdom. According to 9th century Frankish sources, by the early 9th century many of the chieftains in the south of Scandinavia acknowledged Danish kings as their overlords, though kingdom(s) were very loose confederations of lords until the last couple medieval centuries saw some increased centralization. The west and south coast of modern Sweden was so effectively part of the Danish realm that the said area (and not the today Denmark) was known as \"Denmark\" (literally the frontier of the Daner). Svend Estridsen (King of Denmark 1047  ca. 1074), who may have been from Scania himself, is often referred to as the king who along with his dynasty established Scania as an integral part of Denmark.\n\nFrom 1397 to 1658\n\nWhen the Kalmar Union was formed in 1397, the union was administered from Copenhagen. By 1471 Sweden rebelled under Sture family leadership. In 1503, when Sten Sture the Elder died, eastern Swedens independence from Denmark had been established.\n\nIn 1600 Denmark controlled virtually all land bordering on Skagerrak, Kattegat, and the Sound. The current Swedish provinces of Skåne, Blekinge and Halland were Danish and the province of Bohuslän was Norwegian. Skåneland became the site of harsh fighting, especially in the 16th, 17th and 18th century, as Denmark and Sweden confronted each other for control of the Baltic.\n\nSweden intervened in the Danish civil war known as the Count's Feud (15341536), launching a highly destructive invasion of Skåneland as the ally of later king Christian III, who upon his coronation introduced Protestantism to the provinces. Subsequently, in the period between the breakup of the Kalmar Union and 1814, Denmark and Sweden fought in Skåneland in 11 separate wars and other border provinces: the Northern Seven Years' War (156370), Kalmar War (16111613), Torstenson War (16441645), Second Northern War (16571658 and 16591660), Scanian War (16741678), Great Northern War (1700 and 17091720), Theater War (1788), and the Napoleonic Wars (18081809 and 1814).\n\nDuring the Northern Seven Years' War, attacks were launched on Sweden from Danish Halland in 1563, and Swedish counterattacks were launched against Danish provinces of Halland and Skåne in 1565 and 1569. In 1570 peace was finally agreed when the Swedish king withdrew the claims to Danish Skåne, Halland, Blekinge and Gotland, while the Danes withdrew their claims to Sweden as a whole.\n\nDuring the Torstenson War, a theater of the Thirty Years' War, extensive combat took place in the Danish provinces of Skåne, Halland, and Blekinge. By the Second Treaty of Brömsebro (1645) Denmark ceded the Norwegian provinces of Jämtland and Härjedalen and agreed Sweden was to occupy the Danish province of Halland for 30 years as a guarantee of the treaty provisions.\n\nDuring the Second Northern War (16551658), Danish attempts to recover control of Halland ended in a serious defeat administered by Sweden. As a result, in the Treaty of Roskilde (1658), which was largely confirmed by the Treaty of Copenhagen (1660), Denmark ceded the provinces of Skåne, Blekinge and Halland (i.e., Skåneland).\n\nVilhelm Moberg (18981973) in Min Svenska Historia II (Norstedts. 1971) provides a thoughtful discussion of the atrocities which were committed by both sides in the struggle over the border provinces, and identified them as the source of propaganda to inflame people passions to continue the struggle. These lopsided representations were incorporated into history text books on the respective sides. As an example, Moberg compares the history texts he grew up with in Sweden which represented the Swedish soldier as ever pure and honorable to a letter written by Gustavus Adolphus celebrating the 24 Scanian parishes he had helped level by fire, with the troops encouraged to rape and murder the population at will, behavior that may well have been mirrored equally on the Danish side. Skåneland was a rather unpleasant place to dwell for an extended period.\n\nAssimilation with Sweden (1658-1811)\n\nFollowing the Treaty of Roskilde in 1658  but in direct contradiction of its terms  the Swedish government in 1683 demanded that the leading social groups of Skåneland accept Swedish customs and laws. Swedish became the only language permitted in Church liturgy and in schools, religious literature in Danish was banned, and all appointed politicians and priests were required to be Swedish. However the last Danish bishop, Peder Winstrup (16051679) remained in charge of the Diocese of Lund until his death in 1679. To promote further Swedish assimilation, the University of Lund was inaugurated in 1666; the inhabitants of Scania were not allowed to enroll in Copenhagen University until the 19th century.\n\nThe population initially opposed the Swedish reforms, as can be ascertained from church records and court transcripts. The Swedes did encounter civil revolts in many areas, including the Göinge district, in dense forest regions of northern Scania. The Swedish authorities resorted to extreme measures against the 17th-century rebels who were described as snapphanar, a term used for raiding enemy soldiers or bandits. The punishments included the use of impalement breaking on the wheel, as well as the nailing of bodies to church doors. In that way, it could take four to five days before the victim died.\n\nThe transformation of age-old customs, commerce and administration to the Swedish model could not be effected quickly or easily. In the first fifty years of the transition, the treatment of the population was quite harsh. Denmark made several attempts to recapture the territories, the last in 1710, but ultimately conceded the territories as lost.\n\nBefore 1658, one of the provinces of Skåneland, Scania proper, had consisted of four counties: the counties of Malmøhus, Landskrone, Helsingborg and Christianstad. When Skåneland was annexed by Sweden, one of the counties of Scania, Kristianstad County, was merged with Blekinge to form one of a total of three Blekinge counties.\n\nBornholm Rebellion (1658) and Klågerup riots (1811)\n\nIn 1658, shortly after the Swedish Lieutenant Colonel Johan Printzensköld (ca. 1615  December 8, 1658) was sent to Bornholm to start the assimilation process, the population of Bornholm rebelled. Led by Jens Pedersen Kofoed (1628-1691) and Poul Anker (1629-1697) the rebellion formed in the town of Hasle, north of the largest city, Rønne. Before the rebel army reached the Swedish headquarters in Rønne, Printzenskiold was shot by Willum Clausen in the street of Sølvgade, in central Rønne. The Swedish fled the island as a result of the confusion and fear amongst the conscripts; Jens Kofoed installed an intermediate rule and sent a message to King Frederick III of Denmark that Bornholm had liberated itself, and wished to return to Danish rule. This was confirmed in the 1660 peace settlement between Denmark and Sweden.\n\nThe last Swedish assault on the civilian population occurred as late as 15. June 1811, when Swedish military killed \"around 30\" and wounded \"around 60\" peasants in Klågerup. The Swedish army units also arrested 395 people of which 2 became beheaded at \"Stortorget\" (a square) in Malmö at 4. November 1811.\n\nStrikes, Riots and tension building (1811-1878)\n\nIn the beginning of 1820 the Skåne Riots took hold as the populace of the Swedish Counties Halland, Blekinge and Skåne as they felt that the government in Stockholm neglected the southern Provinces, the strikes began in rural farming villages in eastern Scania and Western Blekinge, they believed that Scania should be independent.\n\nIn 1834 a protest in central Malmö resulted in a massive riot where the Swedish military was placed and shot at the big crowd protesting on the central square by the statue of King Charles X Gustaf, 12 people were killed and 45 injured, the event is now named the Malmös Blodbad (Bloodbath of Malmö). This event further grew the idea of secessionism in the area.\n\nThe pro-independence party Skånska Folkpartiet (Scanian People's Party) started in 1851, they were then described as Conservative and Separatist. The party grew larger and larger and by the first election in 1866 they gained 3 seats. But however they began to grew ever more Separatist and the party was outlawed in 1870 one year after the second Swedish Election where they gained 6 seats, the government of Sweden believed that SPP was a threat to the nations security so on the 25th of December 1870 the government disbanded the party and arrested it's leaders and key members such as Gustav Brorson who was their spokesman in the parliament. A month later they were all executed in Malmö on the 25th of January 1871, the remaining SPP members went out in mass protest across the counties of Halland, Scania and Blekinge. The SPP formed a militia in June of 1871 which for several years harassed pro-swedish loyalists. The military was sent in during the spring of 1876 who cracked down on the militia which reformed into the Scanian People's Liberation Army during the summer of 1877 by receiving backing and training from the newly formed German Empire helped train the troops.\n\nScanian War for Independence (1878-1882)\n\nOn May 5th 1878 the SPLA organized a referendum on independence in the three counties, they voted for Independence, on May 20th 1878, Scania, Blekinge and Halland declared independence under the name of Skåneland (Scanelandia), the Swedish military was sent in and the country erupted in a civil war which claimed several hundreds of thousands died, with help from the German Military under the leadership of General a Duke Bernhard III of Sachsen-Meiningen. In 1881 the Swedish Army capitulated and during the fall of 1881 and spring of 1882 the declaration of peace was written up and recognized as well as the first constitution with the offering to Bernhard to become the first duke in a new constitutional Monarchy. Hertigdömet Skåneland (Duchy of Scanelandia) was officially recognized on May 20th of 1882 exactly 4 years after that independence was declared.\n\nDuchy of Scanelandia (1882-1936)\n\nThe country functioned as a constitutional monarchy with a unicameral parliament in the new Capital of Malmö, the Duke was also residing in Malmö Castle. The country was slow to industrialize but in 1900 a large scale project under the SPP lead government industrialized Scania. In 1914 World War 1 broke out and due to its German Duke the country joined on the Germans side, but a early invasion in 1916 by British and Russian troops made them get out of the war. After the Treaty of Versailles they kept their territory and monarch. In 1922 the women gained the right to vote and the eligibility age to vote was lowered to 18 and everyone gained the right to vote, the times were good but in 1928 Bernhard I died and was succeeded by his daughter Feodora who became Feodora I. Then one year later the Wall Street crash happened and the country was slung into a severe economic depression, people moved to the radical sides including the Marxist-Lenninist Worker's Liberation Front and the fascist and nazi inspired Nationalsocialistiska Skånska Folkpartiet (National Socialist Scanian People's Party, NSSPP) who is the far right branch of the SPP who broke of in 1927. They gained huge votes in the 1934 election becoming the second largest party. They allied with the SPP in forming a government and eventually held a bloodless coup with backing from Germany in 1936.\n\nFascism and World War II (1936-1945)\n\nAfter the coup the new fascist government banned all parties and executed their members in the first of 2 great purges who took place between 1936-1937 and 1938-1939. Life in the new Scanelandia changed drastically after the coup, freedom of expression, freedom of assembly and freedom of the press was outlawed. In December of 1938, inspired by the German Kristallnacht the Scanian Leader Anders Karlsberg ordered the arrest, deportation and mass execution of several thousands of Jews. A total of 34 jews were killed in the event and a further thousand was deported to German concentration camps. In 1939 Scanelandia joined World War II on the side of the Germans and assisted in the Invasion of Denmark, they occupied Bornholm, Copenhagen and the rest of Sjælland. But the Russians pushed them back after invading Bornholm in late 1944 and invasion of the mainland in early 1945. During March they took Malmö and Scanelandia capitulated. The Soviet installed a puppet government who controlled everything they gained from WW2 except for Sjælland. The former queen of the Duchy was executed in 1945 by the fascists before their capitulation. The new Communist puppet nation was given the name of Scanian Democratic Republic.\n\nSoviet Puppet and the Cold War (1945-1989)\n\nBetween the years of 1945 and 1947 the country was occupied by the Soviet Union, in 1947 a \"election\" was held however only socialist parties were allowed to run in it. Thus the Scanian Communist Party (Skånska Kommunist Partiet). Their leader Gustav Svensson became President and appointed Jan Fjörling from the old Workers Liberation Front (Arbetarnas Befrielsefront). Together they ruled with an Iron fist completely changing the system, elections were introduced however only Socialist parties were allowed to run in them, all other parties except the Socialist ones allied with the USSR.\n\nAfter a few years of communist rule the populace became ever more restless and agitated because of the undemocratic system. They began to protest but the military with aid of the Soviet military the protests was crushed, but not before the protestors stormed President Gustav Svensson's house and executed him, the soviets organized another election where the more moderate Theodor Björk won, he eased up on the strict laws and after around two decade of ruling the nation the Soviets ousted him and exiled him to Switzerland in 1977. Theodor Björk was later assassinated by the KGB in 1984. After Theodor Björk then Soviet leader Brezjnev appointed Jens Rosling as head of the Scanian Communist Party and leader of the Democratic Republic of Scanelandia. In 1987 Jens Rosling made a terrible mistake by easing up and allowing for some private enterprise which angered the Soviets who cut all ties with Scania, this lead to a huge economic downturn as the Russians weren't financially aiding the Scanian Government. They tried fixing it with more collectivization but that only lead to more starvation, the population began in late 1988 to revolt and in January 1989 they rose up in the January Revolution which saw protests and clashes with the military occurred regularly for several Months. This culminated into the March for Democracy where 100 000 people marched on the parliament in Malmö, it was spearheaded by the secret liberal party named Democracy for Scania (Demokrati för Skåne). Their leader Hans Davidsson was in the front of the march and they stormed the Parliament demanding that Jens Rosling would step down as President of Scanelandia and that free and fair elections were to be held. Jens stepped down and fled to Yugoslavia where he later was killed in a mortar strike during the Bosnian Civil War.\n\nDemocracy and the 2000s (1989-)\n\nAfter Jens Rosling stepped down Hans Davidsson took over as interim president, he helped craft a new constitution and he also disbanded the SKP (Scanian Communist Party). Hans later allowed for several parties to run in the elections and in the constitution gave everyone the right to vote, he set to establish a strong welfare state but couldn't thanks to the weak economy. In 1992 the first elections happened where Democracy for Scania (Now the Liberal Democratic Party) won a majority of the seats and were able to form a one party government, they introduced many reforms such as the legalization of Gay marriage and adoption as well as the current term where the president and Förbundskongressen (Federal Congress) every 4 years with everyone above the age of 18 are eligible to vote.\n\nAfter 3 terms in 2000 the Skånska Socialdemokratiska Parti (Scanian Social Democratic Party) got a majority in the Riksdag and Senate as well as gaining the Presidency, they formed a coalition government of the newly formed Gröna Miljöpartiet (Green Environmentalist Party) and the Socialist Left Party (Socialistiska Vänsterpartiet) who are the remnants of the old Communist Party. The early 2000s also saw a huge economic boom for Scanelandia as many tech companies moved into the country and the automotive industry were built up. In 2005 they became the largest producer of tech in the Nordics, this was also the time they joined the European Union along with several other European Nations. They also strengthened their ties with Sweden by opening up trade and embassies with them. In 2007 they joined NATO and began focusing on their military by introducing conscription and the welfare began taking shape. After the 2008 election the biggest party now became the Citizens Union (Medborgarunionen) which together with Christian Democratic Gathering (Kristdemokratisk Samling), Liberal Democrats (Liberaldemokraterna) and Rural Centrist Party (Landsbygdens Centerparti) formed a coalition government. The country wasn't hit to hard by the 2009 recession and during the 2015 Refugee Crisis they took in huge amounts of people who fled, this saw the rise of the Right Wing Nationalist Scanian People's Party who adopted the same name as the old SPP who fought for independence during the 19th century, they managed to gain seats in the Riksdag but not the senate, the Centre Right coalition managed to stay in power but now in a minority government.\n\nPolitical Geography\n\nScanelandia is located on the Southern Tip of the Scandinavian Peninsula surrounded to the east, south and west by Ocean. To the east and south lies the Baltic Sea and to the west lies the Straight of Öresund and the only drivable connection to Denmark via the Öresund bridge completed in 1999 and opened in 2000. Further to the North West lies Kattegatt which is a part of the North Sea and Atlantic Ocean, to the entrance of Öresund from Kattegatt lies the country's largest shipping port in Helsingborg. To the north is the countries only national Border with Sweden, due to both countries being a part of the EU and Schengen Area the border is open but marked occasionally following rivers and lakes. The country is divided up into 4 counties which is based on cultural, historic and language/dialect lines, these counties have their own smaller governments. The counties is further divided up into municipalities, 45 in total which also take care of administrative areas such as police, schools and infrastructure.\n\nPhysical Geography\n\nThe majority of the country is covered of grasslands mostly used for farming, in the north by the border of Sweden the country is mostly covered in forests primarily made of the famous Scanian Beech Forest. This is also where the highest points of the country is, Halland county is primarily covered in forests and hills, this is also where the highest mountain is, which is not really a mountain mor as a hill. The name is Högalteknall with a height of 226 meters above sea level. The country has a temperate oceanic climate with on average 15-16°C during the summer and -1 to -2°C in the winters. The country doesn't get much snow during the winter much like Denmark how ever this means that rain is very prevalent during October through March. Thats why the average amount of rainfall is 750 mm.\n\nDue to being the 82nd most densely packed nation and most of the population living in urban centers the pollution has become somewhat of a problem, but efforts are being made by the government to reduced CO2 levels by at least half by the year 2025. The nation also has relatively few rivers and streams where the longest river being Rönneå starting in Central Scania eventually flowing into Kattegatt by Ængelholm in northern Scania County, the river has a length of 83 km and a drainage basin of around 19 000 square kilometers. The largest lake is Ivö Lake (Ivösjön) with an area of 50.1 square kilometers. Due to being so flat the nation has a huge agriculture industry with the biggest crops being sugar beets, corn, rapeseeds, rye and wheat. The farms are mostly located in the south east and south west by the two biggest plains, Österlen and Söderslätten. by the west of Kattegatt is two peninsulas famous for its rugged cliffs that goes straight to the ocean, the most famous one is Kullen (The Hill) with the famous lighthouse Kullens Fyr (The Hills Lighthouse). The largest island is Bornholm which is also the southernmost County and Municipality, it's mostly dominated by hilly plains with cliffs to the Baltic Sea\n\nScania has around 1.9 million people, mostly concentrated around the coast and the biggest cities. The population density is 98.2 people/square kilometers.\n\nThe official language of Scanelandia is Swedish how ever it's a special dialect of Swedish where it's almost it's own language as the dialect is quite hard for Swedes to understand, Scanian is quite similar to Danish even using the letter æ when writing. Several word are similar to Danish such as rullebör (Danish: Rullebør, English: Wheel Barrow), Rælig (Danish: Rærlig, English: Ugly, Disgusting or Horrifying) or Mög (Danish: Møg, English: Dirt or Excrement). There are also some Swedish influenced words like Fjåne (Swedish: Fåne, English: Idiot) and Spann (Old Swedish: Spann and modern is hink, English: Bucket).

The counties are lead by a county council (Regionfullmäktige) of elected officials and they preside over things such as Healthcare and Public Transport. The municipalities are lead by the Municipal Council (Kommunfullmäktige) and administer such areas as Urban Planning, Child and Elderly Care, Health and Environmental Issues and Emergency Services. The Counties have special autonomy within the nation. Taxes are also paid on the three different levels, there is the Federal Tax, County Tax and Municipality Tax, the money go to their respective social services.\n\nForeign Relations and Military\n\nScanelandia is very outgoing, being in most international organisations like the United Nations (Since 1946), European Union (Since 2005) and NATO (Since 2007). Scania is also a part of the Nordic Council (Since 1994), this give them very close ties with the nordic countries. Scania also has good relations with Israel and trades with them as one of their closest export partners, much of Latin America also has good relations with Scanelandia as they have signed numerous treaties, the US is also a large partner as they have signed numeral ties and the US sent economic aid to Scania after Soviet years. Norway is the largest exporter of oil to Scanelandia and the leaders have visited each other numerous times. But their closest allies are Denmark, Sweden and Germany, not only having Historical ties to each countries. Sweden and Scania has signed numerous treaties and currently have open borders despite the troubled past with Sweden, Denmark have strong ties to Scania being joint via the Öresund Bridge, Denmark is like Scanias gateway to the rest of Europe. How ever their closest ally is Germany, they have helped each other out since the 1800s and have stuck together as allies since Scanias birth. They have signed numerous treaties and they have many intermarrying, Germany also has the largest population of Scanians outside of Scania as they fled during Soviet years.\n\nMilitary\n\nThe Scanian Armed Forces (Skånska Försvarsmakten) is quite small with a active personel of around 10 000 active duty soldiers and 100 000 in reserves, the military is split into 3 major branches: The National Army (Armén), The Air Force (Luftvapnet) and the Navy (Marinkåren). The President is commander in chief and the Minister of Defense handles the political work of the army like its budget. The current budget of the military is around 1.5% of the GDP. Where the Scanian Armed Forces shines is in the tech, the military uses some of the most advanced techs in the world and thus they are still a force to be reckoned with, some of their weapons include the M4 Carbine and AK5 (Assault Rifles), MP7 and MP5 (Sub Machine Guns) and the Swedish LMG KSP m/39. The current commander of the Armed Forces is Kjell Sturesson.\n\nThere are 4 garrisons in the country, each split up in around the county lines, the garrisons job is to protect the county and train locals. Each solider is assigned to the garrison of their home county. The military has frequent training with the German and Swedish Armed Forces as well as NATO. They have been involved in conflicts such as the Afghan War and the recent Syrian Civil War and the bombing of Syrian Government strategic targets as well as ISIS.\n\nEconomy\n\nThe Scanian Economy is relatively small with a nominal GDP of around 55 Billion US$. The country uses a mix of market economy and wealthfare state, a large portion of the population live on farming as a way to make money, that's why the country has become the Nordics largest producer of Rape, Wheat and Rye. But industry is also huge as the country is among the biggest producers of Tech and Automotive in Northern Europe, most of the industries are privately owned however a few industries like the post service and the selling of liquor and alcohol is state owned under the state owned monopoly. With the rising industry the GDP grows at a steady rate. The big economy gives Scania the opportunity to become a wealth fare state which it is, the government controls areas like public transport, healthcare and schools but there are private alternatives as well which are subsidized by the government.\n\nUnemployment is also relatively low as around 5% is unemployed but the government currently has a program of reducing it to 2% by the year 2020. That plan has been relatively successful as the unemployment was at 8% in 2016 when the current government took power. The biggest export hub is in Helsingborg as thats where the largest port is, this gives Scania a good position as they are in control of the entrance to the Baltic Sea which currently benefits the country greatly as it is seen as a stop of refueling and restocking, thats why Scania is currently cooperating with the Port of Copenhagen as a way to make more money splitting the income of both ports in half.\n\nCulture\n\nArchitechure\n\nTraditional Scanian architecture is shaped by the limited availability of wood; it incorporates different applications of the building technique called half-timbering. In the cities, the infill of the façades consisted of bricks,[70] whereas the country-side half-timbered houses had infill made of clay and straw.[71] Unlike many other Scanian towns, the town of Ystad has managed to preserve a rather large core of its half-timbered architecture in the city centerover 300 half-timbered houses still exist today. Many of the houses in Ystad were built in the renaissance style that was common in the entire Øresund Region, and which has also been preserved in Elsinore (Helsingør). Among Ystad's half-timbered houses is the oldest such building in Scandinavia, Pilgrändshuset from 1480.\n\nMusic\n\nScanian music has been evolving for a long time with traditional music sounding a lot like modern American country music, but there is also an emerging hip hop and metal scene.\n\nFood\n\nThere are many different foods, mostly made of traditional Scanian ingredients. Some famous foods include Pyramid Cakes, Goose Dinner, Egg Cake or Eel Dishes during an Eel Party.\n\nSports\n\nSoccer is the biggest sport in the country with several famous clubs but the most notable is Malmö FF. But there is also many bigger sports like Tennis, Hockey and Orienteering.\n\nInfrastructure\n\nThe country is largely built with an extensive road system going throughout the country and a majority of major motorways beginning here going north into Sweden like the E4 Highway (West to the north east), E6 (South to North), E20 (Connects from Denmark and going North), E22 (From Malmö to Bleking and then into Sweden) and E65 (Southern coast line). But there is also an interconnected web of National Roads and Smaller Roads which connect every part of the country. The railway system is very extensively built out also connecting every main city, the train line is operated by the state owned Scanian Railway Company (Skånska Järnvägar), the center and organ is in Malmö and thats also where the biggest International Airport (Malmö Flygplats, Malmö International Airport) is, the airport is flying to many destinations in Europe like Tallinn, London and Copenhagen. There is also a wide web of phone lines that give everyone a phone connection. Scania also has some of the best Wi-Fi connection as in the most remote places you can still get a signal. The sewage and water system is also extensively built out and has one of the best treatments in the world, practically everyone has access to running water and functioning toilets.\n\nEnergy\n\nThe three largest sources of Energy is from Hydroelectric damms, Wind Turbines and Nuclear Power plants. The two power plants Ringhals and Barsebäcks Nuclear Power plants together producing around 24TWh annually which make up a large portion of the nations total energy production, after that comes Wind Turbine which produce 2.61TWh annually and the third largest energy source is Hydroelectric Power producing around 0.88TWh (880 GWh), the rest is a combination of solar panels, coal and oil power which is often imported from Denmark and Germany. However the country has rapidly seen a switch to Green energy in the last few years with more solar panels and wind turbines being built. Every citizen has access to regular electricity and power lines reverse the country connecting everyone except for those living in the most rural places."
