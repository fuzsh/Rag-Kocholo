The finances of the state are in good condition. All appropriations made by the legislature, when called for have been promptly met. To meet the demands on the Revenue Fund the legislature of 1907 provided for a levy of $1,700,000 upon the taxable property of the state for each of the years 1907 and 1908. In 1907 the maximum of 1.7 mills was levied; in 1908, however, owing to the increased valuation of property, 1.6 mills was used, which will produce the required amount. The legislature of 1907 (Section 35, Chapter 476, G. L. 1907) again au- thorized the Governor, Treasurer and Auditor to make agreements with banks to carry our state warrants for a short time, if it should become de- sirable, or necessary. This provision was employed in the fall of 1907, and again this year, but in moderate sums. In 1907 a total of $787,000 was thus provided for and in 1908 it will not exceed $500,000. Under our law the greater portion of the state revenue is paid into the State Treasury between* the first of February and the first of August, dur- ing those months approximately four million dollars is received from rail- road, insurance, telephone and other corporation taxes alone, and a very large percentage of the general state taxes is paid with the June settle- ment. This is the prime reason for the lean period of the treasury during the months of October, November, December and January, when the treasury is called upon to meet large appropriations. I respectfully suggest to the legislature the advisability of amending the law, so that railroad companies may pay their taxes twice a year. This would equalize the revenue income during the year and avoid the necessity for over-draft or temporary loans. As such an amendment to the law will have to be sub- mitted to the people for ratification at the general election to follow it would be highly desirable for your honorable body to consider this ques- tion at the coming session. The following table shows the estimated receipts and disbursements for the current fiscal year ending July 31, 1909, and the two succeeding fiscal years. In the estimate for 1910 and 1911 a revenue fund levy of $1,000,000 in each year has been used, which sum may be produced by a rate of one mill or less. These estimates show a surplus of $1,275,173.81, which will be available for new buildings and other extraordinary appropriations by the 3 909 legislature. AUDITOR OF STATE.

After the adjournment of the 1907 legislature the constitutionality of Chapter 219, General Laws 1907, appropriating $200,000 annually out of the Revenue Fund for roads and bridges was under discussion. When a claim was presented based on that law, the following letter was sent to the Attorney General requesting his opinion: July 12, 1907. Hon. E. T. Young, Attorney General. Sir: Chapter 219, G. L. 1907, appropriates the sum of $200,000 annual- ly, out of any money in the State Trrnsury, belonging to the General Rev- enue Fund, to aid in building and repairing bridges and in constructing and repairing highways. The said act further provides, that the money shall be expended in such place or places as the Legislature may by law designate. Chapter 405, G. L. 1907, designates the place or places in the state where the money appropriated by Chapter 219 referred to above, shall be expended. The approprif.tions, under Chapter 405, are made available for the two years, beginning August 1, 1907, amounting to $200,000 for each year. A claim against the state was today presented by the County Commis- sioners of Kittson county for $800 for the construction of a bridge in that county, the appropriation for which was contained in the aforesaid Chapter 405, G. L. 1907. Before acting upon this claim, I would respectfully ask, if in your opinion, the above laws appropriating money from the General Revenue Fund for public road and bridge purposes are in accord with our State Constitution. Yours very truly, (Signed) S. G. IVERSON, State Auditor. The Attorney General replied as follows: July 24, 1907. Hon. S. G. Iverson,' State Auditor, Capitol. Dear Sir: In your favor of July 12th you ask my opinion as to whether that portion of Chapter 405, Laws 1907, which makes an approorialion for the purpose of aiding in the drainage and reclamation of wet lands, is con- stitutional under the limitations contained in Section 5, Article IX. I have the honor to advise you that I recently had occasion to examine AUDITOR OF STATE. X111 the road and bridge appropriation of last winter, for the purpose of ren- dering an opinion as to its validity under this same section of the Consti- tution. I came to the conclusion that the act last referred to- was valid and the same reasoning which, in my opinion, sustained the latter act would apply with equal force to the one now under consideration. It seems clear to my mind that the Constitution makers never intended to prohibit the making cf improvements within the state which are neces- sary to the public welfare, and which could not be' secured except by the expenditure of public money therefor. The class of public improvements that was intended to be prohibited were those from the use of which profit might arise and not those which were intended to be made for the benefit of the public without a view to pecuniary profit. The conclusion stated in my former letter on the subject is strength- ened by an examination of the closing words of Section 5 of Article IX of the Constitution, which, after providing that the Legislature might devote to public improvements the proceeds of any land that might be granted to the state for the purpose, added this language: \"And may pledge or appropriate the revenues derived\" from such works in aid of their completion.\" I am, therefore, of the opinion that the appropriation is valid. Yours truly, (Signed) E. T. YOUNG, Attorney General. After the receipt of the Attorney General's opinion we proceeded to pay the claims as they matured under the law and the following circular letter of instructions was sent to county auditors: August 12, 1907. SUBJECT: \"ROAD AND BRIDGE APPROPRIATION.\" ^ To County Auditors: Chapter 405, General Laws ld07, designates the amounts appropriated in each of the counties in the state and determines the manner of its ex- penditure. Section 1 provides that in all cases the work shall be performed under the supervision of the Board of County Commissioners. Section 2 provides that when the work has been completed the Coun- ty Commissioners shall so certify to the State Auditor, stating therein the sum or sums so expended. The State Auditor is then authorized to draw his warrant in favor of the County Treasurer for the amount due. The law requires that the money shall be sent to the County Treasurer. Where the law does not specify the places or amounts to be expended, it rests entirely with the county board to do so. Certain sums may be apportioned to tow4iships or other municipalities as their share in the dis- tribution, but the county board should exercise supervision of the work and certify completion thereof to the State .\\uditor. The amount named for a county is for each of the two fiscal vears end- ing July 31, 1908, and July 31, 1909, except where it is otherwise stated. The appropriation will remain in force up to December 31, 1910. The amounts appropriated for the first year are now available and will be paid promptly upon presentation of the proper vouchers, dulv certified as stated in Section 2. The sums appropriated for the second year will be available for payment by the state on and after August 1, 1908. When the work on any job in a municipality has been completed it can be so certified to this office whereupon payment of the sum expended will be promptly XIV BIENNIAL REPORT made and patyments will continue to be made until the entire sum ap- propriated for the county is exhausted. The sums appropriated under this law (Chapter 405) are separate and distinct from those apportioned by the State Highway Commission. Yours truly, S. G. IVERSON. State Auditor. APPORTIONED SCHOOL FUND. Under Section 2, Article 9, of the State Constitution, the proceeds from sales of land, timber and mineral constitute a perpetual or permanent school fund. The actual receipts from such sales, ending July 31, 1908, amounted to $19,709,383. This sum is invested in interest bearing securities, which average 4 per cent per annum, which amount is credited to what is termed the General School Fund. The General School Fund is apportioned in March and October of each year to the several counties in proportion to the number of scholars of school age, entitled to participate therein. This apportionment is made on the certificate of the State Superintendent of Public Instruction. Since 1887 we have had a state one mill school tax on all the taxable property in the state, which, when paid, into the state treasury has been credited to the General School Fund, and has been dis- tributed twice a year with the apportionment of the other school funds. The following statement, showing the apportionment of the General School Fund to the school children of the state, beginning with 1864 down to and including 1908 has been prepared by the Superintendent of Public Instruction, and with his permission I have included it in my report to the legislature. The one mill state levy appears in amounts noted for 1888 and subsequent years. AUDITOR OF STATE- APPORTIONMENT OF THE CURRENT SCHOOL FUNDS FROM 1S64 TO 1908.

STATE DEBT. The amount of the Miniitsola Funding Bond^. issued under the Act of 1891, remaining unpaid at this time is $250,000; $150,000 having been re- cently called and will be paid on the first of January. 1908. The last of the bonds will be paid within two years. These bonds, it will be remem- bered, were issued to refund the railroad adjustment bonds issued under the act of 1881. The 1881 issue was a re-adjustment of the old railroad bonds of 1858. XVI BIENNIAL REPORT UNCLAIMED MONEY. For a number of years there has been a sum of money in the hands of the State Auditor for the purpose of paying authorized claims growing out of the Railroad Adjustment Act, under Chapter 1, G. L. Extra Session 1881. A commission created under that law set aside a percentage of the amounts paid to claimants to meet other proper and just demands. This unexpended balance was $1,731.83. For many years no claim whatever has been presented against this fund, and as all the laws relat- ing to the matter were repealed by the Revised Laws 1905, no payments can be made hereafter without new legislation. The money can therefore be considered as abandoned and escheated to the state. I have, accordingly, covered this sum into the State Treasury. STATE ACCOUNTS WITH COUNTIES. The state tax accounts with the several counties, kept in this department need harmonizing. I doubt if these accounts have ever been adjusted. It has been the custom to charge the several counties with the amount of the state tax levy, and such additions as may have been made to that levy from time to time, and to credit the payments made in March, June and October settlements, and also to credit reductions by reason of abatements and can- cellations of taxes. These credits are all made upon statements prepared by the county auditors, which have no doubt been carefully and correctly made. But the legislature has authorized at various times, sales of property, forfeited to the state for non-payment of taxes. These sales have been for different amounts, often for less than the total amount of taxes charged against the property. It is undoubtedly extremely difficult to determine just what amounts should have been credited to the several counties by reason of these forfeited tax sales, at any rate the counties have never re- ceived credit for these forfeited tax sales. Other authorized deductions may also have been overlooked in these credits. In statements A and B, found elsewhere in this report, will be seen tables showing the conditions of these accounts with the several counties. They show that on July 31, 1907 there was an unpaid balance of$2,107, 889.04, and for the year ending July 31. 1908. $2,436,036.27. It will be noticed that a few counties had not made their June settlements in full in each year, which would vary the report somewhat, but according to these figures our books show the counties to be delinquent in these amounts on account of state taxes that have been levied. This has continued for a great many years in the past, and has, of course, been grad- ually increasing, and it is a fair presumption that they do not correctly show the true state of these accounts, in other words these figures indicate a large delinquency on the part of property owners, and a corresponding asset on the part of the State, which is to a large extent erroneous. These accounts with the counties should be reconciled, and the only way that it can be done at this time is to obtain from each county auditor an exact statement of unpaid or delinquent taxes, for all years appearing on the tax rolls. After that has been done a basis can be established, and then a system of keeping the records of all changes, whether debits or credits can be perfected. AUDITOR OF STATE. XVU STATE ACCOUNTING AND AUDITING METHODS. During the week ending December 5, 1908, E. S. Pettijohn, Deputy State Treasurer, Frank N. Stacy, Deputy Public Examiner, W. C. Heilbron, Special Public Examiner, and myself visited the 'State financial officers at Madison Wisconsin, Lansing Michigan, Columbus Ohio, Indianapolis In- diana, Springfield Illinois, and Des Moines Iowa. The visit to those states was made after several conferences with Public Examiner Schaefer, with the hope that we could obtain many ideas that could be adopted for improve- ment in our system. The officers of those states courteously granted us every opportunity to become familiar with their methods, and we believe many of the ideas obtained from them can be adopted, which will add to the efficiency of our accounting and auditing departments. Our party was unanimous, however, that taken as a whole, the system we are now using compares favorably with that of any of the States we visited. The financial transac- tions of the state government have increased nearly three fold in the past few years, in both the volume of transactions and the new sources of income, all requiring additional care and management. ASSESSMENT AND TAXATION OF IRON MINES It may be of interest to compare the revenue recieved by the State from the taxation of iron lands since the discovery of iron ore in our state and since mining and shipping began. Under the 1881 law the legislature permitted the taxation of such prop- erty at the rate of one cent for each ton mined and shipped, one-half of which was returned to the treasury of the county in which the mine was located. The following statement shows the amounts received while that law was in force: IRON LAND TAXES PAID INTO THE STATE TREASURY UNDER CHAPTER 54, GENERAL LAWS EXTRA SESSION 1881, AT ONE CENT PER TON, ONE- HALF RETURNED TO COUNTY TREASURER.

XVlll BIENNIAL REPORT Beginning with 1896 the properties were assessed on a valuation basis, and the following shows the valuation of those properties for taxation pur- poses since that time, and the rate of state tax levied for all purposes, which includes the levy of the one mill state school and other funds, the proceeds from which are paid in the same manner as other taxes into the State Treas- ury.

The last legislature (Chapter 328, G. L. Ift07) enacted a law for the taxati'on of mortgages on real property by the payment of a fee of 50 cents for each one hundred dollars, in lieu of the former law, under which they were taxed on a valuation basis, the same as other property. The new law took effect April 30, 1907. The main provisions of the law are easily administered, and it appears to have given general satisfaction. The tax or fee when paid into county treasuries is distributed to all the differ- ent funds, state, county and local municipalities where the property is situated the same as taxes collected under the general law. The. item of credits (No. 22) in the personal property schedule, under which real estate mortgages had heretofore been assessed shows quite' a material decrease by reason of the law, which was to be expected. On May 1, 1906, the total amount assessed in that item was $15,894,826; in 1907, $11,246,479; in 1908, $9,169,710. Our records do not show the total umounts paid to the county treas- uries under the new law, but from the amount apportioned and paid into the State Treasury, it would appear that the total amount paid exceeded the collections under the former method. From April 30 to July 31, 1907, $2,204.49 was paid into the State Treasury, and for the year ending July 31, 1908, $30,552.83 with several large counties unreported. As the state tax AUDITOR OF STATE. XIX rate for the year 1907 was 3.48 mills, it will thus be seen that the mortgage registration tax paid for the corresppnding year was equivalent to the state tax upon more than nine millions of dollars. All things considered, this law is giving general satisfaction. INHERITANCE TAX LAW. The law for the taxation of inheritances (Chapter 288, G. L. 1905) is becoming established as a revenue producer. For the year ending July 31, 1907, $142,358.96 was paid into the treasury; for 1908. $43,454.56; from Au- gust 1, 1908, to November 1, 1908, the sum of $58,323.20 has been received. An important case involving the operations of this law was heard and re- viewed by our supreme court a short time ago. The decision was handed down November 8, 1907 (102 Minn. p. 268). The syllabus and statement of the court is as follows: \"State ex rel, Fred M. Tozer and Others — vs. Probate Court of Washington County and Another. INHERITANCE TAX— TRANSFER TO CORPORATION. A., a man of large wealth, organized a corporation and conveyed to it practically all of his property in return for the issuance to him of all but four shares of its stock. His wife joined in the conveyances, in considera- tion of A. agreeing to transfer to her one-third of all the capital stock of the corporation and to transfer the remainder of his stock to their four children in equal parts, upon their agreement to lease the same stock to A. for his life, not to exceed the period of the corporate existence. The wife also agreed to transfer the stock which she was to receive to the same children, and they were to lease it to her for her life, on the same con- ditions. The various conveyances, transfers, and leases were made accord- ing to the agreements, and the transaction completed January 17, 1903. At that time there was on the statute books what purported to be an inheritance tax, but which was subsequently declared to be unconstitutional. Thereafer a valid inheritance tax law was enacted, which was in force when A. died, in 1905. It was conceded by the state to be immaterial whether A. was seeking to avoid the future payment of an inheritance tax by his heirs under the unconstitutional act then on the statute book or any future law which might be enacted. It was not claimed that any such intent existed. Held: 1. The act purporting to be an inheritance tax law, which was on the statute books at the time being unconstitutional, the transfers and convey- ances are to be considered as having taken place when there was no in- heritance tax law in existence. 2. Chapter 288, p. 427, Laws 1905, the present inheritance tax law, has no application to property which was actually sold and disposed of prior to the time of its enactment. The validity of a transaction such as here involved, at a time when an inheritance tax law is in force, is not involved in this case and is not considered. 3. The children of A. to whom the stock in question was transferred in consideration of the signing of the conveyances by A.'s wife, became the legal owners of the stock. 4. A life estate may be created in personal property, as well as in real estate. 5. The general language used in the leases is restricted by other pro- visions herein, and by the general scope and purport of the instruments when read and considered as a whole. 6. The leases of the stock from the children to A. vested in A. a life XX BIENNIAL REPORT estate in the stock and reserved to the children estates in reversion, which estates were beyond the control of the owner of life interest. 7. The estates or interests of the children in the stock vested in them at the time of the execution of the leases and came into possession upon the termination of the life estate. The stock was not inherited from A. and the inheritance tax cannot be collected thereoai. In proceedings in the probate court for Washington county to admin- ister the estate of David Tozer, deceased, the state auditor appeared and applied for an order of court fixing a time and place for hearing testi- mony concerning the value of the estate of the deceased and the value of the inheritances arising out of the same, and for a citation to each of the heirs directing them to appear and testify at such hearing in order to de- termine the proper amount of the inheritance tax to be imposed. The facts having been stipulated as stated in the opinion, the administrators and heirs of the deceased filed objections to the claim of the state for such tax in respect to the shares of stock of David Tozer Company. The court, F. T. Wilson, J., found the facts as stipulated to be true, found the conclusions of law enumerated in the opinion, ordered an appraisal of the capital stock of the David Tozer Company, and appointed appraisers for that purpose. Thereupon the objectors obtained from the supreme court a writ of certiorari to review this decision. Reversed.\" INEBRI.^TE HOSPITAL TAX. Under Chapter 288, General Laws, 1907, which took effect April 22, 1907, a hospital farm for inebriates was created, and the State Bo^rd of Control directed to select a site and erect suitable buildings, etc. A tax of 2 per cent on all license fees for the sale of intoxicating liquors was provided for, out of which the buildings are to be constructed and the institution maintained. For a time the constitutionality of the law was in question, and a test case was carried to our supreme court. The court sustained the law in every respect. Up to the present time $51,088.40 has been collected, and is in the State Treasury. The State Board of Control has not yet defin- ately selected a site for the Hospital Farm, but will soon be determined. INVESTMENT BOARD. Proceedings of a meeting of the State Investment Board, created by Chapter 340, G. L. 1907, held September 20, 1907. Present: Governor Johnson, Chief Justice Start, J. T. Wyman, Presi- dent Board of Regents of the State University, State Treasurer Dinehart and State Auditor Iverson. George T. Simpson, Assistant Attorney Gen- eral, also present by invitation. It was announced that the state treasury had more than $52,000 of cash belonging to the Internal Improvement Land Fund, which could only be invested in bonds of the United States or of state bonds. The certificates of indebtedness of the University of Minnesota, authorized by Chapter 359, G. L. 1907, were held to be a state obligation under decisions of the Supreme Court. Mr. Wyman offered the following resolution: Resolved, that the state purchase for the Internal Improvement Land AUDITOR OF STATE. XXI Fund, certificates of indebtedness of the University of Minnesota issued pursuant to Chapter 359, General Laws 1907, to the amount of $50,000.00. Said certificates to mature two years from date of issue bearing interest at the rate of 4J^ per cent per annum, and further resolved, the State Treasurer and State Auditor are hereby authorized to complete the pur- chase according to the terms herein stated. The roll being called, the vote being unanimous, all present voting in favor of the resolution, it was declared adopted. No further business appearing the meeting adjourned. JOHN A. JOHNSON, , Chairman. S. G. IVERSON, Secretary. PAYMENTS TO AND FROM COUNTIES. We are often asked for statements showing amounts paid into the state treasury as general state taxes by the several counties and the sums paid by the State Treasury back to the county treasuries for school and other purposes under appropriations made by the legislature. The following fig- ures give the amounts for the present calendar year. The total sum paid into the state treasury for taxes by the 85 counties was $3,648,142.65, and the amount paid back to the counties was $2,630,218.70, leaving a balance or net sum of $1,017,923.95, which remained in the state treasury for the use of the state government. Of the amount paid back to the counties $272,550.00 was for improvement of roads and bridges and $2,357,668.70 for support of schools. It is interesting to observe that in each of 59 counties the amount re- ceived from the state exceeded the total sum of state taxes paid by those counties into the state treasury. The amount of the aggregate excess be- ing $404,143.57. In each of the remaining 26 counties the payments into the state treasury for state taxes were in excess of the amounts received from the state, the aggregate sum of such excess is $1,422,067.54. The twenty-six counties are: Beltrami, Blue Earth, Brown, Clay, Cook, Cotton- w^ood, Freeborn, Goodhue, Hennepin, Itasca, Koochiching, Lac qui Parle, Lake, Lyon, Mahnomen, Mower, Murray, Nobles, Ramsey. Rock, St. Louis, Washington, Watonwan, Wilkin, Winona, Yellow Medicine. Of the general school fund apportionment about $1,000,000.00 came from the state one mill school tax on all the taxable property in the state, and the remainder, $743,188.00 from interest on investments in the Perma- nent School Fund. The general school fund is apportioned by the State Superintendent of Public Instruction to the counties in proportion to the number of scholars of school age, entitled to share therein. The legis- lature has appropriated annually from the general revenue fund, as state aid to higher education, $1,500.00 for high schools, $550.00 for graded schools, $250.00 for semi-graded schools, for common schools of the first class $125.00, and of the second class $50.00.

The business of the State Land Department for the two years ending July 31, 1908, has been very satisfactory. We have received good prices for ^timber sold from pine lands, and the gross receipts therefrom about the same as the preceding two years. The total acreage of agricultural lands sold is somewhat less than the previous period, although the prices obtained about the same. The receipts from mineral lands show a steady increase, and with the opening of new properties next year, the output of from ore will be considerably greater. The following statement show^s the amount of business transacted dur- ing the past four years, for timber cut under permit, sales of agricultural lands, and fees and royalties from mineral lands: TIMBER LANDS. 1905 $433,361.80 1906 547,114.42 1907 573,871.09 1908 535,315.36 $2,089,662.07 AGRICULTURAL LANDS.

The Committee on Drainage in the 1907 legislature, introduced and had passed an act (Chapter 366) providing in substance that when swamp lands had been drained the minimum price thereof shall be $5.00 per acre, plus the cost of draining the same, with three per cent interest on such cost added from the date the drainage assessment was paid by the state, up to the time of sale. Further providing, that when sold the cost of the drain- age and the interest that may be collected shall be credited to the General Revenue Fund of the State, and the remainder credited to the School, Uni- versity or otl^y: trust fund to which the land belonged. Your attention is respectfully called to this law. After two years' trial I doubt its practicability. Its operation is cumbersome, and has retarded the sale of reclaimed lands. The law fixes a minimum price of $5.00 per acre, the same as dry or tillable land, to which must be added the cost of reclaiming them which in many cases brings the minimum price up to ten and twelve dollars an acre. Prior to the construction of the drains these lands were wholly unsalat>le. The state, through its Drainage Commis- sion, or under other laws, caused a demand for these lands by making them useful and capable of cultivation. The operation of this law also makes it necessary to collect the entire amount paid for drainage on each forty-acre tract at the time of sale. This with the fifteen per cent recjuired under the general law, frequently makes the down-payment so high that a sale is prevented. I am of the opinion that the provision for adding the cost of drainage to the minimum of $5.00 should be retained, but should be so amended that the J 5 per cent down-payment should apply to the selling price of the land, including drainage, and the entire proceeds of the sale should be credited to the trust funds to which the land belongs, in- stead of attempting to distribute the principal and interest into several funds. When sold and held under contract these lands at once go on the tax rolls, the same as if entirely owned in fee, thus becoming live pro- ductive taxable property. The amount of the cost of draining those lands will thus soon be repaid lo the public in general taxation. MISCELLANEOUS STATE REAL PROPERTY. The state is the owner of about two acres of land in the city of Duluth, acquired in 1893 for an elevator site, for which it paid $15,565.00. The Supreme Court having held that the state could not engage in the elevator business this site has remained unused. There are also a few scattering tracts of real property acquired in the purchase of assets of suspended banks, and a large number of lots in the old Reform School property in St. Paul, platted as D. W. Ingersoll's Addi- tion. These properties are under the supervision of the State Auditor, the same as school and other lands, but as the law under which other lands are disposed of is not applicable to property of this kind I have refused to make any sales. The time has arrived when the property could be dis- posed of for sums which will repay the state for the amounts invested, and perhaps add a profit. >;XV1 BIENNIAL REPORT I respectfully suggest that a law be passed applying especially to prop- erty of this nature, requiring an appraisal by competent people, and a public sale, fixing the terms of payment at not less than 20 per cent at the time of sale, and giving ten years in which to pay the remainder, at not less than 5 per cent interest. Under such a law sales could be readily made at good figures. DULUTH & IRON RANGE RAILROAD GRANT. We are pleased to be able to report that the grant to this railroad com- pany is susbtantially finished. Under an act of the legisl^plre, approved March 9, 1875, approximately 606,000 acres were granted to that company on the construction of its line from Duluth to Ely; 600,825 acres have been deeded to the company, leaving 5,894 acres. The company has selected about 5,850 acres which will be deeded as soon as patents are received from the United States Government. Under a decision of the Federal Court for the District of Minnesota, rendered in February, 1902, the company was given six months until all the lands in St. Louis, Lake and Cook counties were patented, within which to make the selections to fill their grant. We hope within another year to have the grant entirely adjusted. • STAR ISLAND m CASS LAKE. In my report to the legislature of 19t)7, attention was called to an Act of Congress, approved June 21. 1906, reserving and granting \"Star'* or \"Cooper Island,\" in Cass Lake, near the village of Cass Lake, to the State of Minnesota for a forest reserve or public park, to be so reserved only so long as the state shall use it for park purposes and protect the property. Provision was also made\" for the sale of the land and timber to the state, under such terms as may be agreed upon between the Secretary of the Interior and the Governor of the state. The island contains 967.53 acres, and according to estimates of government cruisers there are 8,066,585 feet of merchantable timber and about 2,000 cords of wood. The logging tim- ber was appraised at from $12 to $14 per thousand feet, and the wood at 50 cents per cord. The total appraisement of land and timber was $125,- 597.33. The land is within an Indian reservation, and if a sale is made the proceeds would go to the funds for the benefit of the Indians. The following letter, written to the Governor on June 29, 1907, is self- explanatory: Washington, June 29, 1907. DEPARTMENT OF THE INTERIOR, OFFICE OF INDIAN AFFAIRS His Excellency, the Governor of Minnesota, St. Paul, Minnesota. Sir: By the provisions of the act of Congress approved June 21, 1906, making appropriations, etc., for the Indian Department for the fiscal year 1907 (34 Stat. L., 325-352). Cooper Island, in Cass Lake, is — hereby reserved for and granted to the State of Minnesota, to be used as a state forest reserve, or public park, upon condition that if AUDITOR OF STATE. XXVll at any time the state shall cease to use the said island so reserved and granted for forest reserve or park purposes, the title to the same shall be forfeited and shall avert to the United States: Pro- vided, that the Secretary of the Interior is authorized to convey the same to the state of Minnesota for such consideration and under such terms as may be agreed upon between said Secretary and the Governor of said state. On March 19 and 21), 1907, Earl W. Allen, Superintendent, in charge of the Red Lake Indian school, was instructed to make an appraisement of the land comprising the island, and the timber thereon, as a basis upon which this department would convey the land to the state of Minnesota, as provided by the act. At the time the Forest Service was requested to detail some one of its employes who was familiar with timber and land values in that locality, to assist Superintendent Allen.* On June 10 Superintendent Allen submitted his report to this office. It appears that he was assisted at different times bv Mr. Burns, Mr. Tomp- kins and Mr. McKinnon of the Forest Service. He submitted two sched- ules (in duplicate), one showing the appraisement of the lands and timber of the allottees, and a like schedule showing the appraisement of the tribal lands and the timber thereon. There are six allotments in severalty on the island, embracing an area of 291 acres. The lands and timber of the al- lottees were appraised at $11,651.80. The tribal lands and timber were ap- praised at $113,945.53, making a total appraisement of $125,597.33. The Acting Secretary of the Interior on June 21, approved these sched- ules of appraisement, and by his direction one copy of each is sent to you herewith. The Acting Secretary instructs me to say that Cooper Island will be conveyed to the State of Minnesota subject to the provisions of the act upon payment of the amounts mentioned in the two schedules. Very respectfully, C. F. LARR.ABEE, Acting Commissioner. I have personally visited this island and know it to be covered with a luxuriant growth of white and norway pine, and the state would do well to acquire it and keep it as a public park. There are a great many dead and down trees that should be cut out and sold, from which a considerable sum could be realized and there would be enough of such timber, sufficient, in my opinion, to pay all the expenses of caring for the property. At the present time it is unprotected, for the reason, that the government, having granted it to the state, has ceased to exercise direct care over it. The ap- praised value of he timber appears to be considerably too high, and no doubt the Governor and the Secretary of the Interior could agree upon much better terms. Active steps should be taken by the legislature to either buy the timber and the land outright or to make an appropriation sufficient to care for and maintain the island for a public park. SWAMP LAND CONTESTS. An unusually large number of contests against the state's claim to swamp lands have been instituted in the United States Land Office at Duluth, during the past two years. One hundred nine (109) swamp land contests were brought by settlers and others, involving 9,774 acres. We have vigorously defended the state's rights in every instance. No case has been allowed to go by default. Decisions involving 2,618 acres have been made favorable to the state and 690 acres against the state. Six home- XXVlll BIENNIAL REPORT Stead entries on school sections involving 880 acres are claimed by set- tlers who have gone on the land before the survey was completed and accepted. We have contested these homestead entries and they are pending before the General Land Office. SWAMP LAND IN THE WHITE EARTH AND THE MISSISSIPPI- CHIPPEWA INDIAN RESERVATIONS. The claim of the state of .Minnesota to the swamp lands granted under Act of March 12, 1860, in the above reservations has made some progress in the last two years, but is not yet definitely adjusted. The following is a summary of the steps taken effecting the lands in the Mississippi-Chippewa reservations, involving about 147,000 acres: On October 22, 1903, a brief in support of the claim of the state of Minnesota to the swamp lands therein was presented to the Commissioner of the General Land Office; on November 14, 1903, the Commissioner re- ferred the question to the Secretary of the Interior; on December 3, 1903, the Secretary rendered his decision sustaining the claim of the state (p. 328, Vol. 32, Public Land Decisions); on December 16, 1903, the Sec- retary prepared Special Lists No. 153 and 154, aggregating 17,474.67 acres which lists were received by the Governor on December 24, 1903. Soon thereafter protests were made on behalf of the Indians, claiming that the lands were not swamp in fact, and thereupon the Secretary ordered an ex- amination of the surveys to determine their correctness. (P. 497, Vol. 32, L. D.) On December 5, 1905, the Secretary of Agriculture in a communica- tion to the Secretary of the Interior objected to the decision of that de- partment, in approving the claim of Minnesota to those swamp lands. The Secretary of the Interior transmitted the legal questions involved therein to the Department of Justice for the opinion of the Attorney General of the United States; on June 16, 1906, the Attorney General rendered his opinion sustaining the opinion rendered by Secretary E. A. Hitchcock, on December 3, 1903. In the fall of 1907 the attorney for the Indians peti- tioned the Secretary of the Interior, James R. Garfield, to reopen the en- tire question, claiming the invalidity of the treaties by which the entire area, of which those swamp lands were a part, was ceded to the United States Government. ■ A hearing was arranged for with the Secretary on December 3, 1907. The Indians were represented by their attorney, and Senators Nelson and Clapp, Governor Johnson, Attorney General Young, and Auditor Iverson appeared on behalf of the State. The entire question was fully discussed. Early in January, 1908, Sec'retary Garfield decided not to reverse the decision of his predecessor, using the following language: **I have decided not to re-open the decision of my predecessor in this matter rendered on an opinion from the Attorney General two or three years ago, except to take un seriously the question whether I can approve lands listed as swamp by the State of Minnesota, which in fact was not swamp in 1860; that the notes of survey followed without further investi- gation w'ould cause the approval of a considerable body of such land seemed to be in evidence.' if AUDITOR OF STATE. XXIX The decision of Secretary Garfield appears to be conclusive on all parties, so far as the legal right of the state to those lands within the reservations which are in fact swamp. The Secretary, accordingly, has caused to be made an examination of the lands in the field in order to determine whether or not the lands so selected as swamp were of that character at the date of the grant. The state was given an opportunity to send representatives to accompany the two crews to be sent into the field by the government to make the examination. We have sent two men, competent both as surveyors and cruisers, to not only assist the govern- ment party but to see that the state's interest is protected. They are now at work and expect to finish by the first of the year. The examination will also extend into the White Earth reservations, where 38,000 acres of swamp lands are under consideration. The questions involved apply with equal force to all these reservations. The large acreage, and the considerable value of the lands has made it a most unusual contest. On behalf of the state we have asserted our rights and claimed only those lands which wercx granted by Congress. We have now clearly established our legal rights, before the departments and the question of identification and approval of the lands remains with the Interior Department. Evidently fearing an early adjustment of this matter a case was brought in the Supreme Court of the District of Columbia, by Gus A. Beaulieu, on behalf of the Chippewa Bands of Indians vs. the Secretary of the Interior, and the Commissioner t}{ the General Land Office, seeking to restrain them from approving and patenting the lands to the state. In this suit the United States Attorney General appeared for the defendants, and on March 13, 1908, filed a demurrer denying the jurisdiction of that court over the defendants in the matter complained of. On April 3, 1908, the Chief Justice of that court filed a decree dismissing the bill of complaint, and sustaining the demurrer. The complainant in the above cause has taken an appeal to the Court of Appeals of the District of Columbia, and it has been set tor bearing on Tuesday, December 1, 1908. Every step in the proceedinijs has thus been closely watched, and the interests of the Indians have also been fully guarded. The state has won every point in the contest thus far. We have reason to feel gratified also that there has been no default on the part of the Indians. In all the various proceedings before the several de- partments and the courts their side of the case has been ably protected. The state is justly entitled to those lands which are swamp, the same as lands belonging to the state under other acts of Congress. We have every reason to believe that it is the intention of the Interior Department to adjust this matter, doing justice, as far as possible, to both sides. The ex- amination of the lands in the field, now being made, will enable the Secre- tary to determine whether or not he can use the field notes of the survey. Some errors will no doubt be found, many tracts shown by the surveys to be swamp are in fact dry, and vice versa. The determination of the char- acter of the land is wholly within the Interior Department. XXX BIENNIAL REPORT MINERAL LANDS.

Besides this additional list there are hundreds of acres of state land very well located with reference to the known iron belts of the state, that have not been explored at all and may contain iron ore. The last legislature repealed the law authorizing the issue of pros- pecting permits on mineral lands. There are at this time 311 mineral con- tracts or leases in force, 61 of which are in the minimum royalty class, and the remainder, 285, are paying an annual fee of $100.00. There are 39,517 acres of land included in the mineral leases now in force. During the two years last past, $432,032.71 was received from all sources from our mineral lands. The following were the active shipping mines: AUDITOR OF STATE. XXXI Missaba Mountain, Pool, Franz, Yates, Wacouta, Alberta, all on the Missaba Range. By our system of inspection we are able to check every carload of ore that is shipped from any of the mines. The indications are that many new mines will be open within the next two or three years, and it will not be long before our annual income from this source will be one million dollars a year, and this will increase as other properties arc developed and prepared for shipment. Regarding a new law for the leasing of state lands for mineral pur- poses, your attention is respectfully called to the report of this depart- ment made to the 1907 legislature, which will be found on page 52 of the text, in which I recommended that the new law, when enacted, should con- tain a provision for a royalty based upon the units of iron in the ore. In the two years that have passed since that report was made I have given the matter further thought, and still believe that such a law would be more just and equitable to both the state and the contracting parties than any other. Contracts between private parties are now usually drawn in this way, and I believe that it is entirely practical, and will not be very expensive to administer. When the state engages in a purely business enterprise of this nature, it should adopt, as near as possible, those business methods pre- vailing in well conducted private concerns. LAKE BED MINERAL LEASES. In my report to the legislature of 1905 and 1907, I recommended that the state should assert ownership over the land under the waters of public or meandered lakes. Iron ore is known to exist under such meandered lakes on the Missaba Range. The people of the state, in my opinion, should have the benefit of those ore bodies. Untold millions of dollars worth of ore might be saved to the people if the legislature would assert its sovereignty over such lands. Owing to the large amounts involved the courts would doubtless have to pass upon our rights before they would be finally established. The legal department of our state has for years favored such a proposition, believing that the land lying beneath the waters inside the meander lines of such lakes is vacant, unoccupied and unclaimed and therefore it of right belongs to the sovereign people of the state. With each passing year the necessity for such a law becomes more apparent, for the lakes for some reason are disappearing. I quote the fol- lowing from F. A. Wildes, State Mine Inspector, representing our depart- ment, under date of September 28, 1908: \"While in Virginia I had a talk with Mr. A. B. Coates. who said that he had purchased the mining rights under the southern part of the Chisholm townsite, being the ore in Lot 5, Section 21-58-20, and that a part of the ore body, some 42 feet thick, extended out under Longyear Lake. His con- tract with the White, Iron Lake Company, provides that in case it be de- termined that the ore under the lake should belong to the state of Minne- sota that he will be relieved from a portion of his minimum outout. He claims to be of the opinion that the ore under the lake belongs to the riparian owner. He expects to open the property some time during the coming year.\" XXXIl BIENNIAL REPORT Under date of October 27, 1908. \"Mr. A. B. Coates, who is operating the Alberta Mine, also owns the mineral lease on the lands near the southern part of Longyear Lake. Part of the ore body extends out under the lake. I am informed he has recently let a contract to strip this mine, and the surface is to be dumped into the lake, thus pushing the water back so that the ore under the water may be mined by the underground system, the same as is done by the Leetonia mine, on its property which lies under Carson Lake. Carson Lake is not a meandered lake as Longyear Lake is. If this is true it is done for the purpose of precipitating the question whether the state owns the ore un- der public meandered waters, or the riparian owner.\" Under date of November 2, 1908: ^'Preparations are being made to strip a part of the Chisholm townsite in order to mine the ore deposit that passes out under Longyear Lake, as I mentioned last week.'* Under date of November 9, 1908: **On my returfi I visited the land near the south end of Longyear Lak? and found Roberts-Kingston Contracting Company had just begun strip- ping between the old school house and the lake. At present they are dumping the stripping south in an old pave-in, making an approach. Long- year Lake is the lowest it has been at this season of the year. Several islands have made their appearance and the south end of the lake is almost dry.\" A bill was introduced in the 1907 legislature, entitled \"An act to de- clare and define the ownership of the state in minerals and mineral lands lying beneath the waters of public meandered lakes and rivers,\" which re- ceived considerable attention, but failed of passage. Such a bill, if enacted into a law would aflfect only lake beds in the mineral districts, or where iron ore or other minerals are supposed to be found. The rights of private parties or owners would not be wronged by a law of this kind. If the courts should ultimately sustain such a law there are possibilities of a large annual revenue for the benefit of all the people of the state. « The Supreme Court of the State of Indiana, in case of State vs. Ports- mouth Savings Bank (106 Ind. p. 435) held in substance that the owner of the land up to the meander line did not get constructive possession of the bed of the lakes. In this case the lake had been drained and the state suc- cessfully claimed it, under its swamp land act from Congress. In the State of Iowa under Legislative Acts the Executive Council of the state is authorized and empowered to survey the meandered lakes and lake beds within the state and sell the same, as provided by law, and they are further authorized to determine what lakes shall be maintained as the property of the state and what meandered lake beds belonging to the state may be drained, improved, demised or sold. (See Section 2900, A-1 to A-32 inclusive of the Supplement Code of Iowa, 1907.) In these states the legislature has recognized the property right of the people in those lake beds. It must be apparent to all that the people of our state have nothing to lose by the positive assertion of ownership. The passage of such a law would give the question standing in our courts, and we would in time have a definite determination thereof. The people of the state have everything to gain and nothing to lose. And if we are ulti- mately successful, as I firmly believe we will be, it will mean a benefit of many millions of dollars to the taxpayers of the state of Minnesota. This subject is again respectfully presented for the consideration of the legislature. AUDITOR OF STATE. XXXlll THE STATE'S TIMBER POLICY. The problem of reforesting cut-over lands unsuited for agricultural uses and saving as much as possible of the remaining forests, is before the American people. In his last message to Congress, read December 8, 1908, President Roosevelt, in speaking of the conservation of natural resources, said: \"If there is any one duty which more than another we owe it to our children and our children's children to perform at oncj, it is to «>ave the forests of this country, for they constitute the first and m-Dst important element in the conservation of the natural resources of the counlry. There are, of course, two kinds of natural resources. One is the kind which can only be used as part of a process of exhaustion; this is true (»t mines, natural oil and gas wells and the like. The other, and, of course, ultimately by far the most important, included the resources which can be improved in the process of wise use; the soil, the rivers, and the forests come under this head. Any really civilized nation will so use all of these three great natural assets that the nation will have their benefit in the future. Just as a farmer, after all his life making his living from his farm, will, if he is an expert farmer, leave it as an asset of increased value to his son. we should leave our national domain to our children, increased in value and not worn out.\" The timely warnings of the president must be heeded. It is well known that forests have an influence on the steady flow of water, climatic condi- tions and temperature, and these aflfect agriculture, manufacturing and commerce, the main springs of prosperity. It is more than a local ques- tion. No state in the Union was more richly endowed by nature in wealth- producing resources than Minnesota. Our great prairies, forests of hard wood and pine, iron ore deposits, lakes and river systems were pointed to with pride by every citizen. The hard wood forests on hillsides and openings, skirting the streams in the southern and southeastern part of the state have nearly disappeared; the same is also true of the big woods of the Minnesota river. The white and Norway pine belt, north of the Twin cities, mainly east of the Mississippi river is but a memory, for thousands of farm homes now cover the bnd where once stood majestic pine forests. For more than fifty years there has been a large annual cut of pine and similar timber for lumber, and yet at thi| time our state has more standing timber than any other state cast of the Rocky mountains. This area ex- tends from Cook county to the edge of the Red River valley. Within thi$ vast timber covered area are the headwaters or soorces of several impor- tant river systems, the waters flowing north to Hudson bay, east to the Atlantic ocean and south to the Gulf of Mexico. Up to the present time these rivers have had a steady flow of water for navigation purposes, and for several of the greatest water powers in the country. Great dams have been constructed for the development of electric energy and many more can and will be built. What will be the condition of these great river systems when the timber cover shall be destroyed, thus drying up count- less millions of tiny reservoirs and springs? The answer is even now found in many parts of our country, and terrible evidences are recorded from some of the older countries of the world. Fortunately the agitation for the preservation of these natural resources began in Minnesota before our rich inheritance was all spent. It is fortunate also that in this movement we XXXIV BIENNIAL REPORT have the active co-operative of many large private owners of timber lands and an awakened public sentiment. Minnesota, by its trust land holdings of about 3,000,000 acres, most of it in the remaining timbered area, is there- fore particularly interested in this question. Well informed men have said that at the present rate and under the usual method of stripping the land, all the merchantable timber will have been cut in twenty-five years. Whether it is twenty-five or fifty years, the present generation should not calmly view the gradual extinction of this natural resource, but we should at once inagurate a practical plan to pre- serve and restore our forests' for future times. For forty-six years it has been the state's policy to sell its pine timber, above a certain size of growth, separate from the land when the timber was reported subject to waste or loss. The chief destroying elements of standing timber, both old and young, are wind storms and fires. Losses from storms have not been serious, but fires have destroyed vast quantities of all kinds of growing timber. If fires can be kept away from young timber, nature would kt once begin a perfect system for restoring the forests. But after the large tim- ber has been cut out, fires have usually followed soon after, and the young trees, representing several years growth, have been burned with the slash- ings and debris. We can therefore conclude that fire is the real enemy of reforestization. and should direct our efforts to stamp it out or effectively control it. If the state owned all the standing timber it would be comparatively easy to solve the fire problem, but there are thousands of private owners, with large and small holdings, who have a right to cut and sell their land and timber, which when cut usually results in damaging fires, and in cer- tain seasons, conflagrations of wide extent. Co-operation with private owners is indispensable. The matter of taxation is likewise very important to private owners who desire to keep their lands for either forest reserves or experimental tree culture. A systematic organization capable of con- trolling fires would require a number of reliable rangers, and would be quite costly, but I believe the large interests, of both lives and property involved, would warrant the expenditure. Private land owners would un- questionably be glad to share the cost in proportion to their holdings. These rangers could perform the duties of state timber cruisers and game wardens in addition to their work as fire wardens. By selling only the mature or dead timber, and protecting the growth of the young trees, which I believe is entirely practical and feasible, the state trust funds would have a large perpetual income from that source. The existing law for the sale of timb^ was framed years ago when pine only was considered of much value, and its provisions were mainly made to cover operations in that kind of timber. Now we have many varieties of swamp and upland timber, each very valuable and each handled in a different way. We have vast quantities of spruce pulpwood, usually sold by the cord; cedar for the various kinds of poles, and tamarack for ties or piling. Our law should be amended with special reference to these mixed kinds of timber. Our State Timber Board, consisting of the Gov- ernor, Attorney General, State Treasurer and State Auditor should have larger powers as regards our timber transactions, and should be empow- AUDITOR OF STATE. XXXV ered to make rules and regulations covering matters of detail, incident to the timber business. Experimental tree planting should be encouraged wherever necessary. Protection of the young timber from fires would be less expensive and perhaps would more cflFectively restore our forests than actual tree planting. It would be quite expensive to plant the trees in the first instance and they would require fire protection the same as the natural growth. But where the native trees cannot get a start, young trees should be planted and pro- tected. The State Forestry Board should have greater scope for its operations and it should be supplied with funds to actually begin the planting of trees, and the purchase of cheap land for such purpose. There are more than 60,000 acres of timber now growing in the southern and western prairie counties, in groves of from two to ten acres each, planted under a tree bounty law, enacted by our legislature thirty years ago. This law gave $2.50 per acre on not exceeding ten acres and for not more than six years. The timber is there today to give evidence of the wisdom of that kind of encouragement. We need more trees, not only in the northern counties, but in every part of the state, in fact in every county. No state bureau can do it all, but must work through county and township organizations and individuals. Every farmer should be encouraged to plant and keep up five or ten acres of good timber. The State University has a forestry de- partment where theoretical tree culture is taught, followed by practical training in the woods. The graduates from this school should find employ- ment in Minnesota. County authorities might be authorized by law to em- ploy a competent forester, if they wished to do so. A trained forester, working with the aid of township supervisors, could in a very few years show splendid results. Barren hillsides and destructive dry runs might be restored to their primitive beauty, if nature is given a fair chance. The wisdom of preserving the water courses and providing timber for fu- ture generations cannot be questioned. Tracts of land that can be made tillable by drainage or otherwise, for agriculture will be needed and so used wherever situated, but non-agricultural lands, wherever practical, should be set aside for growing forests. The losses resulting from the forest fires in the northeastern part of the state only a few months ago, are still fresh in our minds, and demon- strated the inadequate protection for the lives and homes of settlers, thriv- ing villages and standing timber. No time should be lost, as it will require some time to perfect an organization to conquer such fires in their incipi- ency. The new law should be both sound and practical and abreast with the times. I therefore respectfully recommend to the honorable legislature that a stringent fire protection law be enacted, which shall rigidly prohibit the building of open fires in the forest area, and for the organization and main- tenance of a department under the direction of the State Forest Commis- sioner, to enforce its provisions. I further recommend that the law for sale of state timber be so amended that, wherever practical, only the mature and dry timber shall be sold, and that the cutting thereof shall be Jone under state supervision. XXXV) BIENNIAL REPORT A STATE LAND DEPARTMENT. The care and management of school and other trust fund lands is a most important business problem, which will increase from year to year. It is reasonably certain that during the coming fifty years the State Land Department of Minnesota will occupy a conspicuous position in the na- tion, owing to our large natural resources. Many of the states older than ours disposed of their lands years ago, selling land, timber and mineral outright at private, as well as public sales. But our pioneers had in mind a large permanent school fund for the future and laid its foundation in the State Constitution of 1857, by requiring state lands to be sold at public auction and prohibiting the impairment of the fund. Through these and jiiany other safeguards our rich endowments have been preserved for posterity. In 1883 it was estimated that the permanent school fund would ultimately reach eighteen or twenty millions of dollars. It now amounts to more than the last named sum. In my report to your Honorable Body two years ago, I expressed the opinion that our iron lands alone will pro- duce one hundred million dollars in royalties. With the lands, timber and mineral in sight, and the new iron districts discovered within two years, it now seems probable that before the year 1950 our school fund will amount to one hundred and twenty-five million dollars, and the university fund twenty million dollars, and our resources will even then not be exhausted. Every department of the public service should be administered not Only with unswerving devotion to the interests of the people, but with skill and intelligence in business methods, and our people should especially have the best obtainable management of the State Land Department. We now have many departments of far less importance and responsibility than the Department of State Lands. The 'State Auditor has the sole care and control of agricultural and mineral lands, and the same is true of timbered lands, except as to those duties exercised by the State Timber Board, relating mainly to trespass cases and timber sales. Land matters now require a large share of the personal attention of the State Auditor, and w^ith the development of a new policy for the care and sale of timber, and the enactment of a new- mineral leasing law, and the extension of the iron ore field, it is fair to assume that this branch of the work will soon demand nearly all of his time and thought. The Auditing and Accounting Departments are of supreme importance, and must receive carefiil consideration, even now covering transactions of over two million dollars a month. Several boards and commissions also require much of the Auditor's attention. The revenue demands of the state should be correctly and vigorously adjusted, and be properly recorded. Every claim against the state should be audited with the greatest possible care, and in accordance with law. The increase of w^ealth and population will be reflected to some degree in the state's fiscal affairs. The question therefore is, will the best results for the people be ob- tained by continuing the present union of the State Auditing and Land De- partment, or by the creation of a new department to have charge of the land business. The question should be stripped of every consideration, save AUDITOR OF STATE. XXXVll that of the public welfare and our responsibilities and obligations to future generations. I am fully aware of the disinclination of the legislature to burden the people with new departments and offices, which is highly commendable, but, in my opinion, the great interests here involved would be best served by creating a separate well equipped land department, the head of which should be an officer elected by the people. Such a department properly conducted would be no burden to the people, on the contrary, it would justify its creation in increased incomes, and in closer care and administration of our great trust fund inheritances. A strong board consisting of the Gov- ernor, Attorney General, Secretary of State, State Treasurer and State Au- ditor, could be created to act with such land commissioner in an advisory capacity. The conduct of the state's land affairs would then have the benefit of the judgment of all the executive state officers. Respectfully submitted, SAMUEL G. IVERSON, State Auditor.
