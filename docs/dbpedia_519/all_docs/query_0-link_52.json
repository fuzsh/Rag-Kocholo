        "text": "Classic - The bidding is fully handled by the system. The goal is to always place a bid right above the competing bidders but no more than that. The bidding service automatically places bids in your name up to your maxbid. The minimum bidding intervalls vary between items.\n\nComfort - Works like the Classic bid but with the difference that the system takes the current bid and reserve price into consideration in the cases there is one. A good choice if you know you’ll bid high but don’t want to get caught up in bidding below the reserve price.\n\nActive - The bid will be the one you place and is handled manually. Good to use if you want to place a large bid from the start and take home the whole auction, but requires attention from the bidders part in case other bidder might have maxbids in place.\n\nYou can read more about the bidding function here.\n\nThe bid has not yet reached the reserve price which is the price that the seller is willing to sell the item for. If the auction ends without the reserve price being reached, one of the following will happen. 1) The seller accepts the bid and an invoice is sent to the bidder within 3 working days. 2) A representative from PS Auction calls the bidder to negotiate the price within 3 working days. 3) The seller does NOT accept the bid. The item is either not sold at all or re-auctioned."
