        "text": "St. Cloud ( /ˌseɪntˈklaʊd/) is a city in the U.S. state of Minnesota and the largest population center in the state's central region. The population was 65,842 at the 2010 census.[2] It is the county seat of Stearns County[5]. It is named after the city of Saint-Cloud, France (in Île-de-France, near Paris), which was named for the 6th-century French monk Clodoald.\n\nThough mostly in Stearns County, the city also extends into Benton County and Sherburne County. One of the fastest-growing areas in the state, St. Cloud is surrounded by a small metropolitan area, with Waite Park, Sauk Rapids, Sartell, and St. Augusta directly bordering the city, and Foley, Rice, Kimball, Clearwater, Clear Lake, Rockville, St. Joseph, and Cold Spring nearby. With 189,093 residents at the 2010 census, the St. Cloud metropolitan area is the third-largest Minnesota population center, behind Minneapolis-St. Paul and Duluth-Superior, and slightly ahead of Rochester (with 186,011 residents). The population of Fargo-Moorhead is also larger than St. Cloud's or Rochester's, but most of that is in North Dakota, with only 58,999 residents in Minnesota.\n\nSt. Cloud is located 65 miles (105 km) northwest of the \"Twin Cities\" of Minneapolis-St. Paul along Interstate 94, U.S. Route 10, and Minnesota State Highway 23. The St. Cloud Metropolitan Statistical Area (MSA) is made up of Stearns and Benton Counties.[6] The city was included in a newly defined Minneapolis-St. Paul-St. Cloud Combined Statistical Area (CSA) in 2000, even though commuting criteria did not require mandatory inclusion. St. Cloud as a whole has never been part of the 13-county MSA comprising Minneapolis, St. Paul, Bloomington, and parts of western Wisconsin,[7] although its Sherburne County portion is considered part of the Twin Cities metropolitan area by Census Bureau definition.[8]\n\nThe Mississippi River flows through the city, which owns and operates a hydroelectric dam that can produce up to 9 megawatts of electricity.[9][10] The Minnesota Department of Natural Resources designated a 12-mile (19 km) section of the Mississippi south of St. Cloud part of Minnesota's Wild & Scenic Rivers Program in 1976.[11] It has the 30 undeveloped \"Beaver Islands\", multiple channels and sandbars, and no major rapids, and is popular for day trips by canoe.[12]\n\nContents\n\n1 History\n\n2 Parks\n\n3 Popular culture\n\n4 Transportation\n\n5 Education\n\n5.1 Colleges\n\n6 Politics\n\n7 Geography\n\n7.1 Adjacent communities\n\n8 Climate\n\n9 Demographics\n\n10 Culture\n\n10.1 Sports\n\n10.2 Sites of interest\n\n11 Business\n\n12 Media\n\n13 Famous Former Residents\n\n14 Sister cities\n\n15 See also\n\n16 References\n\n17 External links\n\nHistory\n\nMinnesota was organized as a territory in 1849. The St. Cloud area had been opened to legal ownership by non-Native Americans following treaty negotiations with the Winnebago tribe in 1851 and 1852.\n\nSt. Cloud was a waystation on the Middle and Woods branches of the Red River Trails between the Canadian border at Pembina and St. Paul. The cart trains often consisted of hundreds of ox carts; the carters would camp west of the city and cross the Mississippi in St. Cloud or in Sauk Rapids, just to the north.\n\nThe City of St. Cloud was incorporated in 1856. It developed from three distinct settlements, known as Upper Town, Middle Town, and Lower Town, that were established beginning in 1853.[13] The remnants of the deep ravines that separated the three are still visible today. Middle Town was settled primarily by Catholic German-Americans, who were attracted to the region by Father Francis Xavier Pierz. Lower Town was founded by settlers from New England and the mid-Atlantic states. Upper Town, or Arcadia, was plotted by General Sylvanus Lowry, a slave-holding Southerner from Kentucky. Lowry was St. Cloud's first mayor, serving only one year.\n\nLowry battled Abolitionist newspaper editor Jane Grey Swisshelm. At one point Swisshelm's newspaper office was broken into and the press thrown into the Mississippi River. St. Cloud's experience with slavery was brief. Nearly all of the Southerners left the St. Cloud area when the Civil War broke out. Lowry died soon after in 1865.\n\nStephen Miller served a two-year term as Minnesota governor beginning in 1864, the only citizen of St. Cloud to hold the office. Miller was a \"Pennsylvania German businessman\", lawyer, writer, active abolitionist, and personal friend of Minnesota Governor Ramsey. He was on the state's Republican electoral ticket with Abraham Lincoln in 1860.[14] With no previous military experience, Miller enlisted as a private in the Minnesota's First Regiment of Volunteers, and was promoted to lieutenant colonel and eventually \"Brigadier General of Volunteers\".[15] After fighting at Bull Run and in eight other battles, Miller became ill and later transferred to another unit, missing the regiment's famous charge at Gettysburg. His son Wesley, who had enlisted with his father, was killed in the battle.[16] While in military service, Miller also served as commander of Mankato's Camp Lincoln, where 38 Dakota men were executed for their role in the Dakota War of 1862.\n\nAlthough he never attended college, as governor Miller supported higher education, including the state \"Normal\" schools, one of which later became St. Cloud State University. In his final legislative address as governor, he made a strong but unsuccessful argument for a black suffrage amendment to the state constitution.\n\nSt. Cloud was named after Saint-Cloud, the Paris suburb, by John Wilson, a Maine native with French Huguenot ancestry. Wilson later said that his decision came from his interest in Napoleon, whose favorite palace was located in Saint-Cloud.\n\nSteamboats once docked at St. Cloud, although river levels were not reliable. Granite quarries have operated in the area since the 1880s, giving St. Cloud its nickname, \"The Granite City.\"\n\nIn 1917, Samuel Pandolfo started the Pan Motor Company in St. Cloud. Pandolfo claimed that St. Cloud would become the new Detroit for all the Pan-Cars produced. He was later convicted and imprisoned for attempting to defraud investors.[17][18]\n\nSt. Cloud was recently chosen to host the 2012 Can-Am Police and Fire Games.\n\nParks\n\nThe city maintains 95 parks, totaling more than 1,400 acres (5.7 km2) and ranging in size from 80 \"neighborhood and mini parks\" to 243 acres (0.98 km2). The largest developed park, Whitney Memorial Park, is the former location of the city airport. It features numerous softball and soccer fields.\n\nPopular culture\n\nCourtroom scenes in the Disney Film The Mighty Ducks were filmed in St. Cloud, and a few cut scenes were filmed at the Municipal Athletic Center (MAC).\n\nSenator Al Franken and Tom Davis's One More Saturday Night is set in St. Cloud, but was not filmed there.\n\nMarshall Eriksen, of the TV show How I Met Your Mother, is originally from St. Cloud.\n\nJuno was partially set in St. Cloud, which is referred to as \"East Jesus Nowhere\". None of the filming actually took place in the city, however.\n\nThe song \"On a Bus to St. Cloud\", by Gretchen Peters, is on Trisha Yearwood's 1995 album \"Thinkin' About You\".\n\nAcademy Award winner Gig Young was born in St. Cloud and once worked at the Paramount Theater as an usher.\n\nIn the 2007 horror movie 1408, St. Cloud is mentioned as one of the scariest places the protagonist has visited while investigating allegedly haunted houses.\n\nDirector Stephen Sommers attended Cathedral High School in St. Cloud. He then attended college at nearby St. John's University. His 1989 film Catch Me If You Can was filmed in St. Cloud.\n\nWriter/director Wendell Jon Andersson was born and raised in St. Cloud, attending Tech High School. He wrote and directed the film \"With or Without You\" and worked on the Comedy Central television program Mystery Science Theater 3000.\n\nActress June Marlowe, who played Miss Crabtree on The Little Rascals, was from St. Cloud.\n\nJudith Guest and Rebecca Hill's novel Killing Time in St. Cloud is set in the eponymous city.\n\nJohn Bellairs's character Mr. Emerson is from St. Cloud.\n\nIn the novel The Death and Life of Charlie St. Cloud by Ben Sherwood, the main character's mother grew up in St. Cloud.\n\nMattress maker Tempur-Pedic features St. Cloud in its regional \"Cloud\" mattress ad campaign.\n\nNick Yozamp, the winner of the 2010 Jeopardy! College Championship, is from St. Cloud, as is Gary Bechtold, a three-day Jeopardy! champion during the 2009-10 season.\n\nTransportation\n\nSt. Cloud is a regional transportation hub within Minnesota. Major roadways including Interstate Highway 94, U.S. Highway 10, and Minnesota State Highways 15 and 23 pass through the city.[19]\n\nBus service within the city and to neighboring Sartell, Sauk Rapids, and Waite Park is offered through St. Cloud Metro Bus which was recognized in 2007 as the best transit system of its size in North America. An innovative system gives transit buses a slight advantage at stoplights in order to improve efficiency and on-time performance.[20] The Metro Bus Transit Center in the downtown area is also shared with Jefferson Lines.\n\nBus service links downtown St. Cloud and St. Cloud State University with the western terminus of the Northstar Commuter Rail line in Big Lake which in turn links to Minneapolis/St. Paul metropolitan light rail and bus services, providing end to end public transportation between the two metropolitan areas.\n\nSeveral rail lines run through the city as well, which is a stop on Amtrak's Empire Builder line.\n\nSt. Cloud is also home to St. Cloud Regional Airport, from which daily connecting flights to Minneapolis-Saint Paul International Airport were made on Delta Connection, operated by Mesaba Airlines, until January 1, 2010, when the service was discontinued.[21]\n\nEducation\n\nThe city of St. Cloud is part of the St. Cloud Area School District, which serves St. Cloud, St. Augusta, Clearwater, Waite Park, St. Joseph, and Haven Township. The district has eight elementary schools, a new K-8 school in St. Joseph, and two major public high schools, St. Cloud Technical High School and St. Cloud Apollo High School.[22] St. Cloud also has a major private high school, Cathedral High School. Both public high schools offer a broad selection of Advanced Placement courses, and rank high in the state in number of AP tests taken and of test takers.[23] St. Cloud Tech is the older of the two, opening in 1917, and is just west of downtown on the city's south side. Apollo opened in 1970 and serves the expanding north side of the city. Other high schools and secondary schools that serve the city of St. Cloud include St. Robert Bellarmine's Academy, St. Cloud Christian School, Immaculate Conception Academy, St. John's Preparatory School, and St. Cloud Alternative Learning Center. St. Cloud also has one of the most successful charter schools in the state, STRIDE Academy,[24] which is K-8. The nearby cities of Sauk Rapids and Sartell also have their own school districts and high schools, bringing the number of public high schools in the metropolitan area to four.\n\nColleges\n\nThe St. Cloud area is home to several higher education facilities, including the second-largest university in the state, St. Cloud State University. As of 2009, 17,686 students attend SCSU, including 1,905 graduate students. Other post-secondary institutions and campuses in St. Cloud proper include St. Cloud Technical and Community College (SCTCC), Rasmussen College, Globe University/Minnesota School of Business, and the College of St. Scholastica. Additionally, the College of St. Benedict (an all-female private Catholic liberal arts college) is located in nearby St. Joseph, while its all-male sibling school, St. John's University, is in nearby Collegeville.\n\nPolitics\n\nThe mayor of St. Cloud is Dave Kleis, who won reelection in 2008 after his only opponent, Ryan Fagan, abandoned a write-in campaign after receiving little public support. St. Cloud is in Minnesota's 6th congressional district, represented by Michele Bachmann (R). St. Cloud is partly in Minnesota House of Representatives district 15A, represented by Steve Gottwalt (R), and partly in 15B, represented by King Banaian (R). State Senate District 15 is represented by vice chair of the state capital investment committee John Pederson (R).\n\nIn the 2008 presidential election, Barack Obama and Joe Biden won 54% of the vote in the city, and John McCain and Sarah Palin 46%.[25]\n\nPast mayors of St. Cloud include Sylvanus B. Lowry (1856), John L. Wilson (1857–58), E. O. Hamlin (1868), J. A. McDonald (1900), J. R. Boyd (1901), J. E. C. Robinson (1902–05 and 1906), J. N.
