IMf ALL ABOARD With G. E. Mortimore T he cheap sex-and-violence magazines are in¬ tensely depressing to read. They make me think of ugly rooming houses that smell of gas, cabbage and stale tobacco smoke. 'Hie magazines tell of cramped minds. Their storirt are iVTitten for people who live shut indoors with lust, never breathing clean air. The stories disturb me—not because they are obscene but becattse they are boring, damp and unwholesome, like things that grow in the dark. 9px Is a great life force. Those magazines make it appear as a sordid infirmity. What people read those books? Some of them are ordinary people who get their secret kicki from smut. Mostly, however, I think they are the sort of people you see on Granville Street after dark. In case you haven’t been In Vancouver lately, thaf one-time smart shopping thoroughfare is being rapidly taken over by creeps — slouching, loud- talking Jostlers and woman-molesters. They might be endurable if they were light¬ hearted rakes who seemed to be having fun. But they look sour, twisted and full of hatred. Their guffaws of laughter are forced. Those are the people, I think, who buy most of the .smut magazines. I doubt that the magazines made them what they are. 'Hiey are the produrts of a sick society. And I don’t think you could do them^ or the society, much good by clamping a rigid cenk)rship on the newsstands. Our society, and many of the people In it, are badly in need of repair. Many of the people you see on Granville Street after dark really need to be taken to pieces and put together* again in a dif¬ ferent shape.

Sl'NDAV, NOVEMBEK H, IMf A Duncan Hero T he local arts council of the Cowichan community have recommended to the Duncan city council that the memory of Major C. F. Hoey, VC, should be recognized. The idea Is to take advantage of the . icreation of a new city parking lot by beautifying it and in some way a.ssociafe Mth it the name of the Burma hero. Nothing could befit the city of Duncan better. Major Hoey was one of its own sons. He was bom, raised and edu¬ cated there. He served in the local militia before deciding on an army career by going to England, where his quality took him to Sandhurst and a commission in the Lincolnshire Regiment. It was with the Lincoln* he served when adding the Victoria Cross to an earlier-won Military Cross. The official citation describes his “outstanding gallantry and leader¬ ship,” but it is the story of his feat t^at quickens the imagination. A vital Japanese hill post had to be captured and Major Hoey was heard to say “we will take it whatever the cost.** The cost was his own life aiTMmg others, as he led the way and personally wiped out several enemy positions after being twice wounded. He fell only after he reached the objective. — The posthunrwu* award of the empire’s highest and moit coveted military decoration came shortly afterward*;. It was presented to hi* mother, Mrs. Ferguson Hoey, at Government Hou.se here by Lieu¬ tenant-Governor W. C. Woodward in Januar>', 194.5. Thus was bravery above and beyond the call of duty deservedly recognized. The name of Major Charle* F. Hoey is a bright one in the Cowichan valley from which he sprung. It is an inspiration to Island youth In its example of selfless endeavor. TTie city of Duncan will honor itself by honoring its illustrious son, who lie* on a hill-top in Burma with the letters “VC” proclaiming hi* stature. A Test with a Purpose G reat Britain’s first breeder reactor for the production of en¬ riched uranium fuels went into operation last week, as the culmina¬ tion of many months of scientific and engineering effort. At Dounreay, where the massive plant is installed, an inner core of enriched nuclear fuel was made active at heat and pres.sure levels not attempted before. The product after exposure of the main mass of uranium to the intense activity of the volatile core will be plutonium, itself an enriched nuclear fuel many times more potent than uranium in its refined state. Tech¬ nically known as a fast breeder re¬ actor, Dounreay is the most advanced nuclear furnace of its kind in the world. Bev’ond the notable scientific and engineering achievements of the test station is a serious purpose. Britain has already placed a subsidiary part of the load on thermal energy^ gen¬ eration of electricity for its national grid On gas-cooled, graphite¬ moderated nuclear furnaces using ordinary uranium fuels. It* plan* call for a gradual transfer of not less than one-third of such energy de¬ velopment to the nuclear process. Up to now thr operating costs have been higher than would he industrially economical granted even the greatest degree of utilization. If Dounreay lives up to its expectations mounting quantities of enriched nuclear fuel* will be the outcome with direct economic results. A fast breeder reactor literally gives back more fuel than is needed to energize it. The gain comes in a more compact, more adaptable and more potent form, of much higher value than the uranium burned. While Dounreay is new* and exper¬ ience has yet to be weighed, the ex¬ pectation is that it will run with little change until it has completed the transformation of it* first full charge. The enriched nuclear fuel then extracted can he u.sed in many ways, but with the important conse¬ quence that it will have been much more cheaply acquired than is pos¬ sible now’. One use of the enriched product may he for marine nuclear engines. Another, of course, is the prospect of lowering the costs of electric generation. A third result is in a backlog of plutonium for defence and other purposes. If Dounreay gives the results it was designed for there may be sig¬ nificant consequences not only for Britain’s internal program, hut also on the practicability of using en¬ riched nuclear fuels for industrial purposes in the world. Up to now’ the high cost factor has held back development of nuclear reactors for civilian use. If fast breeder reactors cut that cost an enormous source of energy' would become available. One Man’s Poison TN the Ontario Supreme Court the other day. five Canadian manu¬ facturing companies w'ere fined an aggr^'gate of $80,000 for conspiring to prevent competition In the sale of metal culverts and drainage equip¬ ment through price fixing. Two days later, the Public Utili¬ ties Commi.ssion, appointed by the B.C. government, asuspended the licence of a Burnaby trucking firm because it had undercut the agreed freight rate on its Vancouver-Prince George nin. Under ('anadian law,, the action of the five eastern companies in attempting to fix prices was an offence. The statute has been in¬ voked many times in the past in many different industries where there was evidence of combines being set up to defeat the ends of competi¬ tive business. Yet by British Columbia statute, it is an offence if any trucker fails to abide by the rates set by the Provincial Motor Carriers Act. The rate in this instance is fixed and it must not be varied. Yet the trucking firm made the pqint that it had been forced to lower its charge in order to meet “unfair business competition.” It .seems inconsistent that in one industry it is illegal to fix prices, and illegal in another to depart from the agreed rate. The public must certainly be pro¬ tected against creation of monopolies that seek to cut out price competi¬ tion. but it is less obviously in the public interest that legislation should be required to establi.sh minimum price* in a free-enterprise economy. Interpreting the News Adenauer Has His Way By AIAN HARVE% ( anAdian Fresa Staff M riUr D isengagement it dead, subject to the usual political qualifications, that seems to be one certain conclusion to be drawn from Chancellor Adenauer’i three-day vialt to London. After all the talk laat apring about the Rapacki Plan for a *\"denuclearl*ed ’ rone ~iir-eentr.al Europe, after the counties variants on the theme of “freezing of forces.*’ it look* a* though the We*t Ger¬ man leader haa aucceeded in burying the idea for good and all. Prime Mlnlater MacmiOan haa always shied away from the word Itself, prefer¬ ring to talk of “controlled limitation of armaments.'* But ever since hit trip to MosQowr last February, he has shown In¬ creasing sympathy for some method of defusing the trouble spots of «‘ntral Europe. Now it is agreed that the idea carries too much political dynamite for the Fed- ^eral Republic of Germany and for the West in general. In the absence of any clear statement to the contrary, there seems to have been a stiffening of Allied attitudes toward concessions on the German problem, which Is the core of the coM war. There was no algn of any hew Western move In the gtatements the »year-okl ■ A H. [R. h 2 ,. And next It will be Dr. Adenauer who'll want to keep up with the Joneses chancellor made in his Lodnon press con¬ ference. He appeared in good humor, a* though pleased with the results of his talks with Prime Minister Macmillan. British officials have compUlned pri¬ vately that these days they don’t know where they stand with Adenauer—h# changes hla mind so often. There was no sign of any Indecision in hU preaa con¬ ference. Reporters looked in vain for any hint of new German policy. A few weeks ago. the chancellor spoke cryptically of the need for West Germans to “liquidate tha consequences'* of the Second World War. The reference was Interpreted as a pointer to a more flexible attitude on the German Polish frontier question. Adenauer had a reassuring word for those who feel that the new Europe may endanger the Atlantic alliance. Replying to a question, the. chancellor said the new economic groupings in Eur¬ ope wUl not cause any difficulties to NATO: that “ways and means** could be found to avoid a split. Fears about NATO’s future have been expresaed In view of recent French state- ments. revtvtng thoughts of a European third force that would tend to play down ths 15-nation partnership.

Letter from London Real Ruler of Britain Is tha real ruler of Britain? vV The question has been asked.« many times, and the usual answer is “estaWi.shment” — the designation of that coterie of con¬ scientious citizens which persuades the government in power what ia right and proper— and it varies in extent from the rapacity to enforce the abdication of'King Edward VIII to such comparative minor matters as insisting that if a policeman is murdered in the execution of his duty then someone must die on the scaf¬ fold to provide an object les.^on for those who may be similarly Inspired. Rut whilst it is true that the estab¬ lishment exerts a tremendous influ¬ ence It is not the final influence. The real dictator of the United.Kingdom is the chancellor of the exchequer, which in turn means, really, the per¬ manent civil servants who control the treasury. It is a sober fact of political life that the minister who wants to make a succeas of his department must have a sympathetic chancellor and that the real art of ministerial government ia ths rapacity of the minister concerned to persuade the chancellor and ths treasur>’ to make funds available. There Is now a growing move amongst members of Parliament to limit the powers of ths chancellor. The first step, of course, is to maks the annual budget a matter for cabinet discussion. At pre.sent the chancellor Is thf sole arbiter of ths nation’s finances. He prepares his budget in secret and he presents it as an act of courtesy to the cabinet •hnrtly before he presents it to ths House of Commons. It ia essentially By RICHARD L. THO.MA8 one man’s a.sse.ssment of ths rela¬ tive value of all the demands mads upon him by various government department.*. It is painfully obvious that every minister tries to get as much as possible to spend in his own depart¬ ment, in the same way that every member of Parliament wants sub¬ stantial government expenditure in his own constituency. In the result, however, the chancellor, frequently reaches an arbitrary decision on things he knows nothing about -snd the decision is all too often based on the personal a.saessment of the minis¬ ter concerned. The chancellor may regard Bill as a modest sort of chap who would keep his demands to the minimum and give him all he ask.* for but, because Harry does not greatly impress hhn, he-msy well cut his demands substantially. Is it right Of fair that one man should decide the relative merits of a colonial secretary’s demands for colonial development as opposed to a minister of education's demand for new schools or the transport depart¬ ment’s assessment of the needs for new roads? Much too much ia left to the persuasive demands of the minister concerned instead of being decided by the cabinet in conference. The idea behind the dictatorship of the chancellor Is based on fears that a budget leakage could mean fortunes won and lost and that there¬ fore its secrets .should be In the hands of the fewest possible people. It i* an extraordinary contention that the nation’s cabinet cannot be trusted to preserve the nation's secrets — hut even worse is the fact tha^ a demo¬ cratic community In fact Is subject to the dictatorship of one man. The minister of education may approve new schools, or a rise in teachers’ pay but the chancellor can say no. What Can We Do? From the Mnntello (WIscoiMln) Tribune T he following item was distrib¬ uted to every pupil In a Water- town iSDl school. It read as follows: Always we hear the plaintive cry of the teen agers: “What can we do? Where can we go?\" I can make some suggestions. Go home! Remove the storm windows. Paint the woodwork. Rake the leaves. Mow the lawn. Learn to cook. Scrub the floors. Repair the sink. Build a boat. Get a job. Help your pastor, the Red Cross, the 5>*Ivatlon Army. Assi.st the poor. Study your lesson.*. And when you're through — and not too tired — read a good book. Your parents do not owe you en¬ tertainment. The world does not owe you a living. Your village doe* not owe you recreational facilities. You owe the world something. You owe it your time and energy, and your talents, so thi^t no one will be at war or In poverty, or sick, or lonely again. In plain simple words: Grow up; quit being a cry baby; get out of your dream world; develop a back bone, not a wishbone; and start acting like a man or lady. I'm a parent. I’m tired of nursing, protecting, helping, appealing, beg¬ ging. excusing, tolerating, denying myself needed comforts for your every whim and fancy, just because your selfish ego In.stead of common sense, dominates your personality and thinking.

It may be a matter of commenda¬ tion that In fact the chancellor doea u.sually manage to preserve a reason¬ able balance, but few chancellors ran escape a charge of personal prejudice In one form or another. Sometimea his personal prejudice acts Inversely, It was said of one chancellor, for example, that he was exceptionally mean in the amount he made avail¬ able for culture and the arts. Tha reason was that he passionately be¬ lieved in government support for tha arts but he was absolutely determined that he should not be accu.sed of reflecting his own beliefs in tha budget. The result was that he was unjust in an attempt to prove his ow n integrity.

Common Sense .Medical discoveries, designed to lengthen or enhance etijoyment of human life, have always met with opposi¬ tion when the medical profession has attempted to in* trojluce them generally. Pasteurization, appendectomies and numerous other advances which we accept matter-of- tactly toilay are a matter of record. Not only the medical and dental professions hut the public generally' has for geneialions been using for dietary, curative and household purposes many materials which for some purposes are classified as poisons. The commonest example, perhaps. Is ordinary table salt, one of the constituents of which killed and maimed hundreds of Canadian soldiers in the First World War, namely chlorine. This same chlorine is found in many hou.sehold bleach¬ ing compounds, hne of which has the syllable “chlor” in Its name. Fluorescent lights contain a dangeious com¬ pound which emits the white light with which we are familiar. Many natural chemicals found in the earth, absorbed by plants and later ingested when we eift them, are clas.sified as poisons. Should we. then, investigate the composition of every¬ thing we eat, apply to our skin, or use around the home and farm, and then abjiii-e the use of all which contain the remotest .speck of poisonous material? It is largely a matter of degree, and u.se of conyoon sense. Anything used to exti'eme can be dangeious. One can become intoxicated, I have read, by drinking too much vinegar. Sodium fluoride is found naturally in W’ater In many parts rtf the world, and it was the bene¬ ficial effect on the teeth of people using such water which brought it into piominenc*#. It is al.so found in tea. which has been u.sed for generations with no observable iniurv. DAVID SCHOLF.S. 1431 Harrop Road, ^ The Candy Pi^ Mr. Cecil Clark in a re<'ent article on Maple Ray. mentioned a Mr. Lilly who left there to start a candy itore in Victoria. Many years ago. a small boy peeked over a counter and said: “Please give me five cents woith of those candies.” Mr. Lilly, a sub.st,intial figure in white apron, w’earing a brown heard trimmed like that of TMward VII, In silent dignity looked down at me. “Five dollars worth of candy? Yes my boy.” I was too startled to object, but when he put my \"bag of candy on the counter I decided he must have been inking. This unsmiling joke was continued for yeais, but stopped before I gi-ew taller than Mr. Lilly. HLs store on Douglas, between Pandora and Johnson, carried an outstanding stock of candies, fruits, nuts, honey and all the delights of an ice-cream parlor. From the pailor room open stairs a.**cended to the candy kitchen, and on these stairs one often saw pans of chocolates set to cool. Some day's while 1 sat eating Ice-cream, Mr. Ully would pick up some of these fresh chocolates and place them on my table, without a word or a smile, merely blowing dignified cigar smoke as he passed. At noon, as Central School boys stood at attention, we u.sually .saw Mr. Lilly walking home for lunch, up Yates Street hill, puffing serenely on his cigar. Mi.ss Maud Nason, our ever remembered first teacher, presented each of her class of boys, on passing, with a bag of Lilly's candieii. In one front window. .Mr. Lilly kept a large, glistening candy pig. On its side was a magnifying window, reveal¬ ing within beautiful scenery, and fairies that would have won the admiration of Walt Disney himself. There must he many thousands of Victorians who still remember Lilly's candy pig. STIRUNG HANNA. 363 Lampson Street. Why Drink Water?
