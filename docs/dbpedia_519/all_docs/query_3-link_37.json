        "text": "This paper presents case studies on how Cuban universities have increasingly become directly involved with the economic and social development of the country. The paper shows how Cuban universities, from the late 1980s and early 1990s, started reorientation and organization of their scientific research, becoming more directly and intensely involved in the economic and social development of the country. In this connection, special reference is made to the case of a research group at the University of Havana: the Laboratory of Synthetic Antigens. This group developed the first synthetic vaccine for human use approved in the world. In the article, public policies involved in this success as well as different obstacles are discussed. These obstacles demonstrate the difficulties and challenges that universities face when carrying out research and innovation activities related to economic and social development.\n\nSince the beginning of the Revolution in 1959, the advancement of education, from literacy campaigns to primary and higher education, has received top priority in Cuba and consequently, the country can today boast with an extensive pool of human capital, which is situated well above the average for developing countries and in many instances at par with developed countries (Brundenius 2001). Notwithstanding economic, social and human advances, Cuba still has a long way to go in terms of a more effective and widespread utilization of its available human capital, particularly in ways geared towards a decentralised mobilisation of knowledge for the solution of local problems. The recent experience of the country has proven, beyond any doubt, both the relevance of human capital and the crucial need for exploring new ways to transform it into innovation. The severe economic crisis faced by Cuba during the nineties, mainly as the consequence of the demise of &quot;real existing socialism&q...\n\nThis chapter aims to provide an overview of the relation between university, national research, and innovation in Argentina from a historical perspective. As an emerging country, the relation between industry and the production of knowledge is relatively weak. Research and innovation efforts have historically been achieved through national policies; however, these efforts were largely interrupted by de facto governments and economic crises. This chapter addresses some basic R&amp;amp;D indicators and also offers a review of the process that has led to the current institutionalization of the country&amp;#39;s scientific and innovation systems. The role of the university in these relations is further examined. Key features of the Argentine higher education system are described, such as high enrollment and low graduation rates, the creation of new universities, and the large proportion of part-time teachers. Finally, some conclusions are raised regarding the importance of innovation as an imperative of R&amp;amp;D policies and university research in light of the insufficient dynamism of the industry and the weak incentives to foster a close relation between knowledge production and the development of the country.\n\nThis study presents a diagnosis of innovation processes at the Escuela Politécnica Nacional as a case among Higher Education Institutions (HEI) in the Ecuadorian context, and as part of its National Innovation System (NIS). For this purpose, there was built a theoretical model, which considers Capabilities, Results and Impacts (CRI) for quantifying innovation levels. This model was validated by the application of factorial analysis in order to know the interrelationships between variables, and, at the same time, to define which of them helps best to measure innovation.\n\nThis study presents a diagnosis of innovation processes at the Escuela Politécnica Nacional as a case among Higher Education Institutions (HEI) in the Ecuadorian context, and as part of its National Innovation System (NIS).
