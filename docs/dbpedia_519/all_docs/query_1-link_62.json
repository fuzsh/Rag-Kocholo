Established, 1899, by Albert Nelson Marquis. Full cloth. Price, $3.50. The price will be $4.00 per copy after January 1, 1908. This publication aims to give a brief, crisp, personal sketch of every living man and woman in the United States whose position or achievements make his or her personality of general interest, and tells, just the things every intelligent person wants to know about those who are most conspicuous in every walk of life. A valuable feature of the book will be found in the appended addresses.

Thus, the book possesses not only the best attributes of a Biographical Dictionary, but is also a handy Directory of those living people of the United States in whom almost everybody is interested. \"Who's Who in America\" is thoroughly revised, brought down and reissued biennially. No one who aims to keep abreast of the times can afford to be without a copy at his elbow constantly. It contains over 16,000 names and over 2,000 pages.

MARQUIS & COMPANY, CHICAGO 324=326 DEARBORN STREET The Book of Minnesotans A Biographical Dictionary of Leading Living Men of the State of Minnesota EDITED BY ALBERT NELSON MARQUIS CHICAGO A. N. MARQUIS & COMPANY 1907 Copyright, 1907, by Albert Nelson Marquis. 1485714 FOREWORD. The Book of Minnesotans is the result of a conscientious etfort to collect into a single volume of handy dimensions, condensed, accurate, authentic life-sketches of the men of Minnesota who have attained to places of distinctive creditability in the State. The aim has been to in- clude all those living men Avhose worth and work count for most in Minnesota today; the leaders and prominent factors in all public movements and important private enterprises; the controlling and in- fluential representatives in business, financial, industrial, religious, educational, literar}- and other interests of useful and worthy character. In a word, the subjects of this book are the living men whose past en- deavors or present activities have contributed to the progressive achievements and influences of the state. The book is modeled on the plan of \"Who's Who in America,\" a world-famous publication, recognized as the highest authority on per- sonal data pertaining to nationally notable living Americans, but is con- fined to Minnesota, and contains more personal information about leading men of the state than can be found in any other publication. It is intended to be a book of easy reference for the business office and the home library, convenient for use at any moment. It furnishes as complete a compendium and epitome of personal data in regard to those identified with the best movements and interests of IMinnesota as it has been possible to procure by patient care, experienced methods and large outlay of money. It is probable that worthy names have been omitted, but such omis- sions have not been wilfully made by the publishers, and almost every instance of the kind is due to neglect or refusal on the part of the person whose name is missing, to furnish the information requisite for biographical mention. All who Avere considered eligible were 6 THE BOOK OF MINNESOTANS solicited in a respectful way to furnish data. The majority, so re- quested, responded freely to the request and thanks are hereby exten- ded for their courtesy. Such difference in the relative length of the biographical sketches presented in this volume as may be found is not often the result of editorial discrimination. In most instances the sketches which may be regarded as too short have been unduly curtailed because of the in- completeness of the data furnished for the paragraph. Speaking generally, however, the biographical notices combine completeness with brevity, embodying all the salient facts in a succinct narration. Accuracy has been most carefully and earnestly sought. Not only have the facts been procured, wherever possible, from first hands, but the completed sketches have been submitted for correction and verifi- cation, giving to each the force of autobiographical sanction, with very few exceptions. Not a single sketch has been paid for or inserted on account of any financial consideration whatever and all are free from eulogy, and presented in a form that experience has shown to be most satisfactory for read}' reference. The man of business, especially, will find The Book of Minnesotans helpful in many ways. It is in a special degree a work of reference con- cerning the men who represent the business interests of Minnesota. The question often arises, when mention is made of some person : \"Who is he and what does he do ? \" In the fewest words possible, this book aims to answer those questions and, in addition, to present the main facts in the business record of every person mentioned. The book will give the business man a closer insight into the larger business interests of the state and place him in closer touch with the men who are in control of business affairs. To the press of the state, and the whole country, this volume pre- sents features of easily recognized value. Here the newspaper man will find many facts of present interest and by the use of the book many errors resulting from hasty picking up of details from unre- THE BOOK OF MINNESOTANS 7 liable sources may, in a large measure, be avoided. This is quite as important a matter to the individual as to the newspaper, for who would not wish, when he becomes the subject of newspaper notice or comment, to be correctly represented, and thus avoid becoming the subject of ridicule or misconception. The Book of Minnesotans will also be a constant and fruitful source of profit and pleasure in the home librar}^ Often in home conversation the name of some person comes up in such a way as to raise an inquiry or difference of opinion as to his native state, his school or college, his status as to marriage, parentage, business connections, or his past or present civic or other honors or achievements. Such questions, for lack of reliable means of reference, have usually remained unanswered ; but with The Book of Minnesotans in the home library, the ready, reliable and satisfactory solution of such problems will be always accessible. Any person who looks through this work intelligently will be amply rewarded for his time. To the thoughtful student of men and affairs who lingers over its pages, the volume presents a marvelous record of individual achievement and makes plain why ^Minnesota has attained the enviable position she holds today. It is the present purpose of the publishers to make such periodical revision of The Book of IMinnesotans as may seem to be called for by demands of those who find it useful. With this purpose in view the publishers will be glad to receive suggestions of improvement and expansion for use in subsequent editions.
