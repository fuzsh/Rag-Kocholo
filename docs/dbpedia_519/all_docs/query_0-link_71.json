        "text": "Newsweek journalist Stryker Mcguire (2000) in his article on “Shining Stockholm” in February this year. Surfing on the present telecom and Internet euphoria in Sweden he chose to focus on the mechanisms behind the dynamic loop in wireless and broadband in Sweden-a convergence on needs, skills and attitudes that according to one of his informants has made Sweden to “the most advanced consumer test-bed on the planet-far ahead of the rest of Europe and the United States”.\n\nDuring the 1980s and 1990s Finland and Sweden were on the international frontier in telecommunications, pioneering the first‐generation cellular system and leading in the development of the second generation. This strength in telecommunications has developed under various regulatory regimes in a complex industrial history, going back to the nineteenth century. To account for this Fenno‐Swedish telecom trajectory, the article starts out with Porter's model of industrial competitiveness and theories of public procurement, and then focus the attention and analysis in two directions: (i) the historical role of advanced, research‐intensive users and competitive public–private development pairs; and (ii) the emergence and significance of a composite binational clusters and their local agglomerations in the accelerated industry growth in the 1990s.\n\nAbstract The Nordic countries, and most especially Finland and Sweden, have been very successful in the development of international leadership in both mobile telephone penetration and mobile terminal and infrastructure manufacturing. Nokia and Ericsson are often discussed as world leaders in product design and innovation for both terminal and network infrastructure."
