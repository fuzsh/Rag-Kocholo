        "text": "It's hard to hitchhike on trains. But there are ways to get free train rides.\n\nStanding near the train track and be hitchhiking train ? It hardly. But we can succeed.\n\nIf you're in an organised hitchhiking competition...\n\n...then it is very possible. Choose your train and wait at the platform. When the train arrives, work out who the conductor is and run up to him/her. Explain your situation (using an 'international language' such as English often works best, often better than speaking the conductor's native language), show them some documentation for your competition and don't be afraid to beg. Telling a story about a dangerous experience two hours ago on the roadside (true or not...), and how much you want some safe and secure travel after the traumatic experience, works well. By this time, the train is now running nearly a minute late and there is a good chance that the conductor will say Yes, because he needs to end the conversation and keep the train moving. So get in, sit back and relax :).\n\nTom and his two team-mates tried using this trick when train through the Netherlands and Germany on Sheffield University's 'Bummit' hitchhiking competition. 9 out of 13 conductors we asked said Yes, and let us travel as much as we needed on their trains. It didn't work when the train was either crossing an international border, or it was a high-speed train, or the conductor just didn't want to bend the rules...\n\nTrain hopping\n\nIn the United States, train hopping is still quite popular. In many states it's easier than hitchhiking. This is advanced jump style. But be careful on this type of train. It is really dangerous and failure can caused death and of course, you can get high penalty too (Pounds 1000 in United Kingdom). Threat is not only penalty like inside train for passengers.\n\nGeneral train styles and guidelines\n\nTrain hopping in Europe is generally easy as countries don't have a good system to track fines. This means that if you have for example a Spanish passport and got a fine in France, you won't get the fine ever, except if you move to France one day and get a job etc.\n\nThere are different approaches to train hopping but it's good to keep in mind that the ticket inspectors are aware of all tricks and games. You can try and stay in the toilet for the whole journey but in some countries and trains they can unlock the toilet if they suspect you don't have a ticket, especialy in central Europe (Czech, Slovakia, Poland, Hungary). There are toilets checked by controller often especially in long-journey trains (EC, IC, SC). You could leave the door unlocked to try and fool them but that means every passenger would open the door as well... You can run around the train as well, trying to avoid the ticket inspector which may or may not work. These techniques may get you into more trouble and are generally not pleasurable but are very important for people with no ID since if you get caught and the ticket inspector wants to write you a fine, they will ask for a passport and if you don't have one or refuse to give it it is very likely that they call the cops.\n\nSo for people with ID, who are foreigners in the country, in most cases it is OK simply to find a quite place on the train, wait for the ticket inspector and kindly explain to them your situation (imaginary or not). In a lot of countries the law says they are obliged to write you a fine (which you will never have to pay as long as you give a fake address or say you don't have one) but they may kick you off. They may also threaten to call the police. It depends on each person how they prefer to deal with this - whether to argue or not, whether to plea or not but just keep calm as if you get aggressive it is a valid reason to get the cops on you. In case that a ticket inspector actually calls the police without a valid reason (no ID, being aggressive) don't panic, the most that can happen is they search you and/or escort you off the train station. Generally, when choosing which train to take, opt for express trains - those with fewest stops, as you are unlikely to get far with regional ones - and you may get stuck in a station where almost no trains stop. It's very useful to memorize (or write down) the timetable, so that you instantly know which is the best train to take after you get kicked out of the previous one. In central Europe (Czech Republic, Slovakia, Poland, Hungary, Lithuania...) - you can use jump style tat is called short distant ticket trick. Conductor usually check only new passengers and he do not remember their final destination. So you buy ticket only for short distance and you show it to conductor. But after final destination on the ticket you continue journey, sit and sleep. This is not complete free, but cheap. More difficult jump style is similar. Blue jumpr come and he check new passengers. You are new but you do not respond (sleep, look out of window, read a book). Around some big cities - like Stockholm, Helsinki, Oslo - there are local trains without regular checking, only sometimes groups of inspectors in uniforms come. It is easy with these trains. These trains has lot of stops and trains go often (once a 10-60 (120) minutes, close to Helsinki even once a 5 min, around Stockholm once a 30-120 minutes, around Oslo L trains once a 30-120 min). High-speed trains are good, because they have big distance between stops 50-200 km or more = (Pendolino, IC, EC, SJ SnabbTaag, TGV, Freccigarossa, Treno Italo, ICE, night trains). But ticket checking is usually harder (conductors in both sides of wagon and toilet checking too - in Italian Treno Alta Velocita). Usually they kick you out or they ask for ID. Sometimes, they call police or they make extra stop for you in small station with not so many local trains (without waiting room) or even in fields. It happens rarely, if you have bad luck for conductor or if you are too rude. And sometimes they give echo to conductors in next high-speed train.\n\nSearching for train connection and stops during journey\n\nPeterOB tried to write some schedules for trains in Nordic countries, where trains does not go so often. But the schedule can change and some countries (Sweden) has difficult schedule. Important is to find stops during journey, where you can be kicked out\n\nEvery country has their own web for searching connection (Buses, Trains, City public transport), or more web pages. The web pages for searching train connection are vr.fi in Finland, sj.se in Sweden nsb.no in Norway dsb.dk in Denmark, jizdnirady.idnes.cz/vlaky/spojeni/ and cd.cz in Czech-Slovakia (you are welcome to add more pages). But these web pages can be with lot of JavaScript and difficult can be even switching to English. It is possible to find stops during journey there usually, but it can be quite difficult find, how to do. PeterOB tried to find stops at sj.se without success, but there is way, how wind stops during journey.\n\nThere are some web pages for whole Europe, where you can find train connection for example eurail.com But there are not regional or commuter trains so good (if any in some regions). And you can not find stops during journey.\n\nThere is another page, where you can find all train connections include stops during journey for all Europe. It is Czech web for searching connections is Czech-Slovakia (all city transport, buses, trains, planes). But there is trains connection for whole Europe on this web. The link for searching train connections is here jizdnirady.idnes.cz/vlaky/spojeni/ But there is no English. It is possible to find stops during journey on this web But it is not possible to find, if station has waiting room, or when waiting room will be closed. Buses are there for Czech and Slovakia only, except few buses in Europe (these buses are usually connected with train company). There are distances in km for every stops Czech and Slovakian buses and trains that go through Czech-Slovakia.\n\nTranslation for searching connection (Vlaky = Trains Autobusy = Buses, MHD Vsechna = all city public transport, MHD = city public transport, Odkud = from, Kam = to, Datum a cas = date and time - two edit fields, Pouze přímá spojení = without train (or bus) change during journey, Pouze vlaky bez povinné rezervace = only trains without seat reservation obligatory, but it usually does not show many trains, especially long-journey ones).\n\nErrors during request for searching Zadání není jednoznačné, upřesněte prosím zadání - the station or city - town - village is not specified exactly (more stations with this name), write it more exactly. Objekt nebyl nalezen = this station or town or city or village is not in database\n\nIf you click for complete train, you get list of stops and schedule Translating: Stanice = station Příj = arrival Odj = departure Pozn = notes for this stop Km = distance in kilometers from begin of train journey to this station (Distances in km are aviable only for trains that goes through Czech Republic and Slovakia). (zastavuje jen pro nastup = only for boarding, zastavuje jen pro vystup only for getting off, but it is only for ticket-reservation possibility, you can get in-off or be kicked out anywhere).\n\nButtons under connections Zmenit zadani = Changing searching request Nove zadani = new searching request Trvaly odkaz =permanent link to connection, Hledat spatecni spojeni = searching for connection back, in another direction (from destination to start station). And buttons down-left Predchozi = three connections before, nasledujici = (three) connections after. At first request idos.cz will find three earliest connections after selected date and time.\n\nTranslation for connections that has been found And then you find connection, some notes are - Příští stanice = Next Station, Vlak se prave nachazi ve stanici = Train is now in this station, povinná rezervace = seat reservation obligatory, moznost rezervace = seat reservation is possible, jede = train goes at this dates, jede do = train goes until this date, jede od train goes since this date, od = since do = until, globální cena = global ticket price, not interesting for us, vozy 1. a 2. třídy = wagons with first and second class, pouze vozy 2. třídy = wagons only with second class.\n\nAnd there are some symbols, what is in train - like beds, restaurant, bar or bistro, car transporting, etc\n\nError 1 Spojení nebylo nalezeno = Connection was not found Možné příčiny = It can be caused by\n\nspojení v příslušném časovém období neexistuje = no connection exist in this time mezi výchozím a cílovým objektem neexistuje přímé spojení = there can be not direct connection (without changes), (if you have selected direct connections only for searching). spojení nelze realizovat povolenými dopravními prostředky = connection is not possible with selected type of vehicles due to our database status (if you have selected only trains, buses etc.)\n\nThis application usually marks most of regional-commuter trains like blue R some commuter trains are missing (commuter trains by Stockholm, P train in Helsinki), and it marks green all IC, EC or high-speed trains with seat reservation obligatory. it shows seat reservation obligatory in all IC-EC trains. Only few international trainss are red like EN and INT\n\nThe semi-regional trains for longer journey are usually marked like blue too, but the letters are various, some are still like blue R (for example in Sweden OTU - Oresundstaag, in Norway REG trains are regional, not local trains). The long journey trains are usually green with letters EC, IC or specific letters (TGV in France, X2 is SJ Snabbstaag in Sweden, S2 is Pendolino in Finland, Green AE or Red INT is Allegro train between Helsinki and St. Pettersburk, FR or FA is high-speed train in Italy - Treno Alta Velocita, FB is something like IC train in Italy - FB FRECCIABIANCA). Some Night trains are marked ICN (green) and some night Trains like green NZ (Moscow-Helsinki), some night trains are red EN - Euronight. Many night trains (in Finland, in Sweden are marked like green IC or even blue REG in Norway)\n\nBut some Long Journey IC trains are still blue like regional (ICs in Norway are marked like blue REG, long journey trains from Stockholm to Narvik or (Goteborg) Stockholm-Lulea or Lulea-Narvik are marked sometimes like blue R Arcitic circle train)\n\nSometimes - one trains is marked like two another trains (R train Helsinki-Tampere, trains between Oslo and Goteborg), and some trains has two symbols (for example train between Helsinki and St. Peterburg is red INT or Green AE ). Even some high speed trains can be missing there (probably purple Treno Italio - AV train in Italy).\n\nThe most important for this Czech database is that you can find stops during journey Unfortunately - you can not find in this Czech application, which stations has waiting room, or when waiting room is closed.\n\njizdnirady.idnes.cz/vlaky/spojeni/ is only for trains, it is part of idos.cz , where you can find all buses and trains and city public transport in Czech Republic and Slovakia (not in Europe, you can find only trains and few buses in whole Europe). You can find all stops, time table (arrival and departure) and for Czech republic and Slovakia only - you can find length of journey between stations in km. Unfortunately - this page is not in English.\n\nThis application is created by CHAPS (software for transport schedules) and there is possible to download database of schedules and trips from chaps.cz like complete database, only trains (in Europe) or only buses (Czech and Slovakia) or city public transport for selected city in Czech-Slovakia. And there should be database of planes too. Unfortunately, English is missing.\n\nAustria\n\nFreeriding trains in Austria works fairly good.\n\nIn long distance trains they usually check tickets of everyone only once or twice during a journey. Usually in beginning of the journey. So if you manage to hide during the initial checking (toilet, luggage compartment, walking around the conductor pretending to be calling on phone…) you can then just sit down and pretend to be checked already. After the initial checking they will just ask for new passengers so you just read your book and don’t react. Also if you enter the train not in the first station you can just pretend to be already checked. Most long distance trains start either in Wien or Graz or somewhere in neighboring countries. So if you for example wanna go from Salzburg to Innsbruck the train comes from Wien and was most likely controlled already so they will ask just for new passengers. If the train comes from other country they change the crew on the border so then the Austrian crew is likely to check everyone. With the long distance trains you can cross whole Austria without having any problem. Usually it is mostly about avoiding the one time they control everyone and then just ignoring them when they ask for newcomers.\n\nDon't pretend to be sleeping. It is better to just read o book or look in phone and ignore them when they ask for new passengers. If you pretend to sleep (or if you sleep) they are likely to wake you up and ask for your ticket.\n\nSometimes you are unlucky and they think you are new in train and ask you for a ticket. The best think is to stay calm and tell them that you already showed the ticket and that you come from... (Graz, Wien, whatever big city that the train is coming from). After saying this just look back to your book or phone so that the conversation is finished. It often works and they let you be.\n\nSome of the long distance trains are the new fancy once (similar style as ICE or TGV) but some are bit more oldschool. For freeriding it does not make much difference. Unless you like to hide in a luggage compartment. The new fancy trains have usually shelves for luggage where you can hide behind your backpack. The older once often don't have those shelves and have just a shelve above the seats. So forexample the trains from Wien to Innsbruck and Switzerland are the new ones and trains from Graz to Salzburg or Innsbruck are the older ones without luggage shelves.\n\nIt seems liket that there is a clear pattern on when they control everyone. So if you ride regularly you can kind of figure it out.\n\nFrom Graz to Salzburg (and oposite direction as well) they check everyone in the begining and then they ask just for new passengers.\n\nFrom Graz to Innsbruck they check in the very begining and then ask for new passengerrs but as the train ride is very long it is possible that the conductor will change and new conductor might control everyone again.\n\nFrom switzerland (or Bregenz) to Wien they control between the begining and Innsbruck. Then it is chill again. Then they control between Kufstein (or Worgl) and Salzburg. Between Salzburg and Wien they usually just ask for new passengers.\n\nFrom Wien to Switzerland (or Bregenz) They control somewhere between Wien and Salzburg. From Salzburg to Innsbruck they just ask for new passengers. Between Innsbruck and Switzerland they might control again.\n\nBetween Wien and Graz (in each direction) they often control in begining and then just ask for newcommers but it seems to be not so sure as sometimes they control bit later. So keep attentive.\n\nAll those information is just from observation so there is no guarantee that it works always like this but it seems to be usually like that. It is experiences from 2023 so in future it might change.\n\nRegional trains are often without any control. But often they do control. Maybe 50% of time there is a conductor and 50% of time not. But that is very not precise estimation. If you are lucky there is no conductor and you can just relax and enjoy your ride. If there is conductor there is not much you can do because the regional trains are quite small so it is easy for conductor to have overview about who they already checked and who not. You can buy a ticket just for few stations and stay in the train for longer. Regional trains often have a ticket machine inside of a train. You are supposed to buy a ticket before boarding the train but in some little stations there is no ticket machine so you shall buy it inside of the train after entering. That can be very useful because you can just go into the train without ticket and if you see that there is a conductor you can go to the machine and buy a ticket. They might be unhappy about that because you are supposed to have ticket before but you can just say that you were super much in hurry to catch the train so you could not buy it before. They might be bit grumpy but nothing more.\n\nIf you get caught without a ticket they will probably ask you to pay and if you refuse they might ask for your ID or kick you out. The penalty is about 140 euros. IF you get fined and you don’t pay it you might get debts but you can not be put in prison for that. It is a debt to a private company (even though state owned) but not to state directly so nothing more than having debts can happen to you. If you are foreigner chances that something happens are even smaller. If you are not aggressive or anything like that and you say you have no money and no ID they will most likely just ask you to get out on the next station. The chances that they will call cops to get your ID are very low. The few conductors that have kicked me out until now where quite chilled and polite. It is really not a big deal to get caught. They just kick you out and you wait an hour or two for the next train.\n\nThere is a lot of police controls while entering Austria from south and while leaving to Germany. So if you are crossing the border you maybe don’t want to be hiding in a toilet. Cops usually walk through and look for people with darker skin to ask them for papers. They are not interesting in tickets. But maybe if they find you hiding behind your backpack they might tell it to the conductor.\n\nThere are no gates to get into trains so you can always just get in. Same applies for public transport in cities. In cities you can also freeride trams, subway and most buses. Most of the time it will be relaxed. But of course you can be unlucky and get controlled but the controls are rather rare.\n\nhere is the old article with a lot of useless information:\n\nAustria is not so big country in the middle of Europe and big part of this country is with mountains – Alps. There is big motorway A1 from Germany to Hungary (Munchen – Salzburg – Linz – Wien – Budapest). You can easily hitchhike there at exit of fuel stations. Another motorway goes to south – not so far from Rosenheim (Germany), the A1 motorway split to Munchen and south branch to Insbruck and Kufstein. And around Insbruck – the motorway spilts too – one direction to west (Switzerland) and one direction to Italy (Brenero, Bolzano, Verona). Insburck is big crossroad with beauty-full mountains around (up to 3300 m.n.m.). One hitchhiking place is fuel station before Insbruck. Many cars go to Italy (Sea, Skying), but there are only few cars in this fuel station, few cars go to Italy, and many hitchhikers waited there very long (few hours or even two days). Another possibility is hitchhiking with sign (Italy, Switzerland, Salzburg, Germany) before entrance to motorway in east Insbruck. Hitchhiking to Italy or Switzerland can be really bad here. If hitchhiking does not work, you just go to train station. Is it easy to jump on city bus inside Insbruck and taking it for free. (or another city in Austria) (penalty in city public transport can be for example in Wien 103 Eur) and you can go to train station or big road at the end of city.\n\nIf you want escape from cold to Italy. You try to get to Insbruck and from Insbruck to Brennero and Italy. But hitchhiking does not work so good from Insbruck to Italy. Brennero-Brenner is border Austria-Italy. It is around 1200 m above sea, it is narrow valley between mountains. There is motorway and rail road. It is highest and coldest point of journey. There is snow usually from November-December to March-April. Mountains around are high – up to 3300-3700 m above sea. And there is already snow in July in some places up in mountains. There is a lot of police checking in Brennero because of migration (on direction from Italy to Austria). Train track goes not so fast downhill to Insbruck (around 38km long by road). And train track goes quite fast downhill to Bolzano with a lot of tunnels. There are EC trains wit few stops and Italian local train (Treno Regionale) with lot of stops, but there s almost ticket checking. There is warmer in Bolzano than in Isbruck or Brennero, but Alps are there still, mountains and hills continue to Tremto, Rovento. Just around 30 km before Verona is tunnel for train, it means end of hills and warm low-land with palms. And south from Verona to Sicily – temperature rises, but quite slowly. It is long journey and around 5-10 degrees difference between Verona and Sicily.\n\nTrain stations in Austria are quite good. You can find on the station all trains (arrivals and departures) with all stops for every train and time for arrive and departure in every stop during trip. It is important. Some small stations for local trains can be without waiting room, But big stations are open during night (just some sitting places are closed), because of night trains. But it can be quite cold in the stations too, not so good heating system can be there.\n\nThere is no ticket control during entering into station or entering into train. But if your appearance is like homeless or backpacker, conductor can ask you for a ticket while entering into night train. There are not so many passengers in night trains.\n\nConductor usually does not check toilets. You can try to hide there and does not lock the door. But do not stay in toilet too long, because another passengers can go there too. Stay there just when conductor is passing around. Or you can just play like you were already checked or you just hide between many passengers, especially close to bigger town. You tan try short distance ticket trick in regional trains R and REX. You buy ticket for 15-40 km (around 5-8 Eur), you let be checked and you continue much further after. But it is quite expensive in EC and RailJet trains with not so many stops. If you are captured, you can be simply kicked out, especially from regional train. There is bigger probability, that conductor write fine for you in EC, RailJet or night train. Or he just kick you out. Some Peter's friends was captured in Austria (Austrian residents too), and they sometimes got fine, which will be never paid, or they has been kicked out. Penalty is around Eur 103, but you don't need to pay, if you are not from Austria, or you can give fake address.\n\nThere are really a lot of police checking in trains from Italy to Austria and Germany (especially direction to Germany), and maybe in trains from Wien to Munchen can be police too. They control everything on platforms and many times in train (especially close to Italy-Austria border), because of Immigrants. Police checks toilets, space under seats too. But they are searching for immigrants, they do not check usually European people. And they checks ID, not tickets. But they can check some drug smuggling too.\n\nFirst type is regional train R. This train have a lot of stops, every 3-10 km. Interval to next train is usually 1-2 hours. PeterOB have not tried this train. There can be a lot of people inside close to big city and conductor can go only one time, or not so often. But it is dubious. The REX train is similar to R train. But distance between stops is bigger, around 15-30 km and interval to next train can be around 2 hour (include R trains shorter). You can try short distance ticket trick – you buy ticket only for short distance (around 15-30 km, it cost 6-8 Eur), you will show ticket and you will continue longer than destination in you ticket. Or you can try to hide between passengers close to big town or toilet tactic (you just sit on toilet when conductor goes around and you don't lock the door). You can play that you were already checked after first control too, when conductor goes around.\n\nIf you want to go to Italy, stops for REX train are: (Innsbruck Hbf, Matrei am Brenner, Steinach in Tirol, Brennero/Brenner – border with Italy, few stations to Bolzano (3 or 7)). Between Brennero to Bolzano is easy to jump – Italian regional train goes there, usually without checking. From Italy to North – there is regional train (treno regionale) from Bolzano to Brenero once a hour. Conductor usually do not check tickets but police is searching for immigrants. There is truck stop with wingette selling for Austria and fuel station in Brenero. Really Lot of trucks are there. But you have to cross motorway with not so many cars. You have to be careful during this action. Or you can take EC train from Verona to Germany, it is one stop from Brennero to Insbruck, and conductor goes there (and police too). Then you take for free city bus to east Insbruck and there is entrance to motorway.\n\nNight trains are good, because they have not so many stops. But there are only beds with reservation and it is possible that you can't get inside coupe and you stay at corridor with backpack and conductor will see you. These trains are international, with police, and conductors too, of course. And conductor might ask you for a ticket during boarding. But these trains are quite long and you just get in as in shade as possible.\n\nIf you want to go to Italy, from Insbruck – stops for EC and night trains are Munchen or Wien …...... Insbruck HBF, Brennero (border), Brixeno, Bolzano, Tremto, Verona …..… Rome, Bolonga or Milano or Venezia.\n\nR 409 (red at idos.cz) is best night-day train from Moscow to France, it is the best, with fewest stops:\n\nMoskva Belorusskaja 11:18, Wjasma 14:10-14:36, Smolensk 16:33-16:38, Orscha Central 17:49-18:05, Minsk(BY) 20:22-20:37, Brest Central 0:24-0:50, Terespol 1:08-1:58, Warszawa Wschodnia 3:49, Warszawa Centralna 4:25, Warszawa Zachodnia 4:35 , Katowice 7:13-7:18, Zebrzydowice 8:22-8:23, Bohumín 8:43-9:07, Břeclav 10:50-11:18, Wien Hbf 12:27-12:41, Linz Hbf 14:19-14:26, Bischofshofen 17:37-17:41, Innsbruck Hbf 20:44-21:21, Brennero/Brenner 22:00, Bolzano/Bozen 23:53-23:55, Verona Porta Nuova 1:16, Milano Rogoredo 2:55, Genova Piazza Principe 4:34, San Remo 6:44-6:46, Bordighera 6:58-7:00, Ventimiglia 7:10-7:58 , Menton 8:08-8:10, Monaco-Monte-Carlo 8:19-8:21,Nice Ville 8:34\n\nBut long journey train R409 does not go every day.\n\nNext type is EC train. EC train goes usually once a 1 hour or once a 2 hour. Distance between stops are usually 30-80 km, conductor goes usually every stops. PeterOB tried only two EC trains for one stop only, he was hiding in toilet with unlocked doors when conductor pass around. But you can just play that you were already checked. Ticket for shorter distance than you go is possible, but not so cheap. And some EC trains (from-to Italy) are only with few passengers, these trains are quite empty. There are lot of coops in direction from Italy to Germany and they look everywhere (toilets, under seats), because they check immigrants.\n\nThere are EC trains between Munchen (DE) and Verona (IT) once a two hours, in both directions. Some trains continue from-to Venecia or Bolonga. Stops are: (München Hbf , München Ost, Rosenheim , Kufstein, Wörgl Hbf, Jenbach, Innsbruck Hbf, Brennero/Brenner, Fortezza/Franzensfeste, Bressanone/Brixen, Bolzano/Bozen, Trento, Rovereto, Verona Porta Nuova, Bologna Centrale, or erona Porta Nuova, Vicenza, Padova, Venezia Mestre , Venezia Santa Lucia). There are Italian conductors in Italy and probably German conductors in Germany. Situation between Insbruck and Rosenheim is better, because there goes RailJet train to Wien once a hour.\n\nNext and best type of train is blue Railjet, because of fewest stops. The distance between stops is around 40-100 km or even longer. There are usually two conductors and a lot of passengers. You can hide in toilet and play shitting when conductor is passing around, PeterOB already tried it successfully. Or you can try just be between passengers and play that you were already checked.\n\nRailjet or EC train between Munchen (DE) – Wien (- Budapest) goes once a two hours, but between Salzburg and Wien more than once a hour: Journey Munchen-Wien takes only 4 hours and it is 2:40 hours from Wien to Budapest, stops are (München Hbf, Salzburg Hbf , Linz Hbf, St.Pölten Hbf, Wien Meidling, Wien Hbf ) and some Railjet trains from Munchen continues to Hungary with stops ( Wien Hbf, Hegyeshalom, Mosonmagyarovar, Györ, Tatabanya, Budapest-Kelenföld, Budapest-Keleti pu). The Night train EN 463 Kalman Imre has the same stops (München Hbf 23:35 …... Wien Hbf 6:35-6:39 …... Budapest-Keleti pu (9:24).\n\nWien – Budapest: The journey is around 2:40 hours, RailJet train goes every hour, stops are (München Hbf, Salzburg Hbf , Linz Hbf, St.Pölten Hbf, Wien Meidling, Wien Hbf ). Railjet or EC trains usually begins at Munchen Hbf. Some EC trains continues behind Budapest, for example 4 hours more to Nyiregyhaza , stops are: (Budapest-Keleti pu, Szolnok, Törökszentmiklos, Kisujszallas, Karcag, Püspökladany, Hajduszoboszlo, Debrecen, Nyiregyhaza).\n\n(Zürich HB - Switzerland) - Insbruck-Wien: It is around 4:15 hod long journey, RailJet trains goes every hour (from Zürich HB to Insbruck Hbf once a two hours). Some RailJets begin in Switzerland (Zürich HB) and some RailJet trains does not stops between Salzburg and Insbruck. Stops are: (Zürich HB , Sargans , Buchs SG, Feldkirch, Bludenz, St. Anton am Arlberg, Landeck-Zams, Imst-Pitztal, Ötztal, Innsbruck Hbf, Wörgl Hbf , Kufstein, Salzburg Hbf, Linz Hbf, St.Pölten Hbf, Wien Meidling, Wien Hbf, Flughafen Wien).\n\nWien – Bratislava SK: There are local trains from Slovakian train company, train runs once a 30-60 min from 4am to midnight. It is 66 km and 66 minutes and 7 stops. You can try just hide between passengers or in toilet. Short distance ticket trick can be more difficult. Stops are: (Wien Hbf, Wien Simmering, Wien Stadlau , Wien Hausfeldstrass, Siebenbrunn-Leopoldsdorf, Marchegg, Devínska N.Ves, Bratislava hl.st.).\n\nFrom Graz to Wien and Czech Republic: There is RailJet train once a 2 hours (Graz – Wien - Prague), and few EC trains goes from Wien to Czech Republic. It is 90 km and 54 minutes from Wien Hbf to first Czech station Breclav. Most of trains are RailJet and they continue to Brno, Prague. Stops are (Graz Hbf , Bruck/Mur, Kapfenberg, Mürzzuschlag, Semmering, Wiener Neustadt Hbf, Wien Meidling, Wien Hbf, Breclav, Brno hl.n., Ceska Trebova, Pardubice hl.n. Praha hl.n.). RJ from Wien 19:02 has four more stops in Czech – Blansko, Letovice, Svitavy, Kolin.\n\nThere are EC trains, which goes from Wien to Breclav and Ostrava, Bohumin, Poland. EC 104 Sobieski 8:10 from Wien continue to Breclav, Hodonin, Ostravava hl.n. 10:59-11:01, Warszawa Centralna 15:04-15:20, Gdansk Glowny 11:11-18:14, Gdynia Glowna 18:36. From Wien 14:10 EC 102 Polonia continue to Warszawa, the same EC 406 Chopin from Wien 22:50 to Warszawa and D 100 Moravia (with beds too) from Wien 18:10 to Bohumin 21:08. But it os much more stops on the journey. It is only one stop from Wien to Breclav (CZ), 8 stops from Breclav to Bohumin (last CZ station), 9 stops from Bohumin to Warszawa Centralna, 6 stops from Warszawa Centralna to Gdansk Glowny and from Gdansk Glowny last 5 stops to Gdynia Glowna (18:36). Only train from Wien 8:10 continue behind Warszawa to Baltic sea (Gdansk).\n\nThere are local trains from Wien to Breclav too, they runs once a two hours, it is from Wien Hbf 1:29 hour and 9 stops in Wien, 14 more stops after Wien to Breclav. This train can be with a lot of passengers close to Wien and conductor can go only 1-2 times. But it is much more better to take EC or RailJet train without stop between Wien and Breclav, than local train R or REX with lot of stops.\n\nThere are trains from Linz to CZ (Ceske Budejovice and Prague). It can be only 5 stops from Linz to Summerau (last stop in Austria), next stop is Horni Dvoriste (CZ) and 10 more stops to Ceske Budejovice. But some local trains from Linz hbf has 14 stops to Summerau and more 12 stops from Horni Dvoriste to Ceske Budejovice. Many stops are Request only. REX trains has from Linz 5 stops to Summerau usually and stops in Czech: (Rubnik, Kaplice, Velesin mesto, Ceske Budejovice, Tabor, Praha hl.n., Praha Holesovice) – not so many stops in Czech Republic. There is usually one local train from Linz to Ceske Budejovice once a 2 hours and REX train from Linz directly to Prague only once 4-6 hours, these trains are best with fewest stops in Czech.\n\nLast type is ICE train. ICE trains goes usually in Germany and only few ICE goes to Austria. One ICE goes from Wien to Munchen and Hamburg. Another ICE goes from Insbruck to Munchen and more further (Berlin, Hamburg). ICE has in Austria the same stops like RailJet or IC trains, but in Germany – ICE are faster (up to 300 kph) and with not so many stops. Distance between stops can be 100-500 km. Conductor check it in Germany very hard and you can get fine or conductor call the police. 'Germany is not recommended for BlackRiding. PeterOB's friend was two times captured in Germany (train and tram) and he was 14 days in prison. But it is probably not so hard now, it was few years back. Usually only one or two ICE a day gets from-to Wien or Insbruck.\n\nBelgium\n\nIn Belgium you can get fined for not having a ticket, or not using the one that you have correctly. Taking a train from Charleroi to Brussels, a conductor issued a fine of 72 euros for a 12 euro journey, all because the details of the trip (a 10 journey pass) where written in pencil and not in pen. Be careful.\n\nRegional trains are very bad, sometimes they're checked quite heavily, and, since they have so many stops you are unlikely to make it anywhere. There are non-Thalys TGV trains going to France from Brussels, although it may not be that obvious at first.\n\nMuch to their own annoyance, Belgian railway staff do not have any legal right to ask for your ID, so under no circumstances show it when they ask for it! Prino 09:58, 3 May 2011 (CEST)\n\nCzech Republic and Slovakia\n\nThere are many types of train in the Czech Republic and Slovakia. This two countries are very similar about free riding in trains.\n\nThe local trains (OS) have many stops, distances between stops are usually 3-10 km. These trains have only few carriages and one conductor. But there are often small amount of people in this type of train. Faster local train is (SP - spesny vlak). This type is similar to local train (OS) but average distance between stops is about 10 mm. Local trains have many stops and relative short journey usually less than 100 km. The interval to next train is usually 1 to 2 hour.\n\nThe R-trains (and some ex trains) have stop usually once a 10-35 km, about 5-8 carriages and usually two conductors or only one conductor. The interval between trains s 1 or 2 hours but in the most frequent area (Prague-Olomouc) is the interval between trains 30-60 min.\n\nThe long-journey trains EC, IC, Ex (often international trains) have about 7-11 wagons, restaurant wagon and first class wagon .This type of train have large number of passengers and two conductors. The distance between stops is 40-70 km (25-50 km for EX trains) and especially in overcrowded trains conductor check tickets and the time interval to next control is long (30-60 min and more). But if you are captured, you will bee challenged to pay penalty or the conductor ask for your ID card. The time to next stop is long and conductor have enough time to write the penalty.\n\nIn Czech is the ticket price equal for all trains belongs CD (Ceske drahy). The speed train EX, EC, IC and R have the same price like OS. You have to buy seat reservation only in SC/Pendolino - PeterOB does not recommend it. But some EC/IC trains (Black Leo Express and yellow Regiojet, this trains belongs private company) have another special tickets and this trains are very difficult. In Slovakia R-trains are little bit more expensive than OS-trains and EC,IC trains are more expensive (difference is about Eur 2-4). Regiojet have yellow OS train in Slovakia and this type is OK.\n\nImportant: Do not use the speed long-journey train SC (Pendolino). It is expensive a you have to buy seat reservation. There are small number of passengers and big probability for get penalty. Be careful on the journey between Prague and Ostrava. The most of trains in Czech and Slovakia belongs to state company and trains that belongs CD are OK. But some IC trains (yellow Regiojet and black Leo Express) belongs private companies. Problems is that you have to seat reservation and the conductor have all reserved seats in computer and conductor do not ask for tickets. But if you are on the seat and the conductor's computer signalize free seat, but you are on the seat - this is problem. This is reason that you can use short-journey ticket trick or similar tricks. And black IC \"Leo Express\" is worst - you have to show ticket before boarding. Regiojet have some local trains in Slovakia. In yellow local trains is all OK. You can use the short distance ticket trick (see bellow). Unfortunately many stops and small amount of passengers is reason that travel complete free is very difficult.\n\nImportant: Conducter is in the train always except some local trains, but the inspector (reviser) randomly enter in trains, check the tickets (like in public transport), but he check too conductor's work and if the inspector find some person without ticket, he can give a penalty for conductor. The inspector check all - passengers, toilets, conductor's work. Some Person travelled from Prague to Ostrava and had ticked only for short distance (to Pardubice). But the ticket inspector came and gave them penalty for every stop (6 stops without ticket = 6 fines), the passenger showed the short distance ticket which end far away. Fortunately, the inspector in train is quite rare, once a 10 000 km. PeterOB has travelled more than 70 000 km and meet inspector 5 times and paid only one penalty. The inspectors do not wear a uniform, conductors usually wear a uniform (blue suit, pink in region and black in Leo express). You can detect conductor relative easily.\n\nGenerally -there are few trick how to travel in train without ticket. I travel in Czech Republic in trains during years 2009-2014 more than 70 000 km and this contains 50 000 km without ticket. Because his appearance is not average, PeterOB does not travel without ticket complete, but usually uses short journey ticket trick. He paid penalty CZK 400 (USD 20) only once a time (the inspector came) but he had to leave the train about 10-15 times and had to buy ticket about 15 times (more expensive ticket, difference is CZK 40 CZK about USD 2, in Slovakia about Eur 2). He has met a train inspector 5 times.\n\nThe very successful method in not complete free but very cheap travel. PeterOB used it for more than 70 000 km in last 5 years. For extreme case - he traveled 346 km and paid only CZK 26 / EUR 1. New record for one ticket is 447 km from Prague main station to Zilina (390 km without ticket). PeterOB have ticket only from Prague-Liben to Kolin - one station behind Prague (57 km / about Eur 2.2), he showed this ticket (before Kolin) and continued behind Kolin (Sleep, read a book, look out of window). In Horni Lidec (Czech-Slovakian border) conductors crew changed but Slovakian conductor went only one time to Zilina and PeterOB walked around the conductor. Important is that the conductor check only new passengers in the next control, usually ask who is new (Pristoupili?) You buy ticket only to short journey, conductor check you and you do not leave train in stop, where your ticket end, and continue the journey. Conductor do not remember terminal stations on passenger's tickets and look for new passengers. You can look out of window, \"sleep\" or read a book. If the conductor remember your terminal station, you tell that you do not know where is or tell that you asleep. Important is that the conducter must come before terminal station, which is written on the ticket. PeterOB usually looks where the conductor is and the direction of inspection and goes near him. The optional distance is 10-20 km or 3-5 stops in local train OS (SP is similar), 1-2 stops or 20-40 km in R train and 1-2 stops or 50-80 km in speed long-journey train with restaurant (EX, EI, IC). The long-distance trains with restaurants have many carriages and two conductors. Because there are many passengers and you do not know the direction of ticket control, the situation is sometimes difficult. If you travel long journey, especially though big city - you can be surprised with conductors change. New conductor check ticket in all passengers (NOT only new passengers). You must have second ticket from the city where conductors changed to near stop.\n\nThe next tactic is for travel complete without ticket. PeterOB has told that conductor check only new passengers and he ask, who is new (Pristoupili?) and you are new but do not respond. If the train have a lot of passengers, the conductor do not remember who is new (but if your appearance is not usual, there is big chance that conductor ask you for ticket). But many of local trains and sometimes too R-trains have small amount of passengers, especially in the night. In the long-journey trains with restaurant (EX,IC, EC) is this method very successful because there are a lot of carriages and passengers and too long time intervals between ticket inspection. Problem is starting the journey in first stop or conductor change. All passengers have to show ticket during first control (or new conductor). You can try go around conductor during ticket inspection and stay in area, where tickets have been already checked. You can go into this already checked area in a stop (get of board an boarding into optional area). In local trains near big city is too a lot of passengers and you can there use another trick. The train with name City Elephant have two floors. If the conductor walk though first floor through carriage, you can go though second floor and get behind the conductor in the zone where tickets were checked. You have to look when conductor is coming into your carriage. You can use similar in one floor long local train with many passengers near big city. Look which part of train is occupied with conductor and you can get off and boarding into opposite part of train in the stop. For example conductor is near first carriage and you go near last carriage.\n\nIf you are captured, you can buy the ticket (for short journey of course) in the train. This ticket is often more expensive (difference is CZK 40 or about USD 2, in Slovakia Eur 1.5), but if you remember the stations without ticket selling - the ticket that you buy in train is for the same price like in station. But if you are captured that you have been hidden and try travel without ticket, you will be kicked out of train in the most cases (in OS or R train) or you have to buy the ticket. PeterOB recommends to look for interval to next train or time of last train before traveling (for example web page www.idos.cz - choose trains (Vlaky)). The local trains have often long interval and the last train arrive quite early. The R-trains, EE, EC, IC is usually more often (1 hour) and last train is just during night.\n\nSometimes, you can get fine (penalty). The fine is CZK 400 or USD 20 (and CZK 1000 or USD 50 if you pay the fine it later than 14 days after you have been captured). You can get the fine especially in the long-distance train with restaurant. In OS or SP and usually R-train you are often only kicked out of the train.\n\nPeterOB does not recommend hiding in toilet, it is very wrong tactic in Czech Republic and Slovakia. Conductor has to check the toilet (it is rule for a conductor) and conductor have special key to open locked door. If you do not lock the door, the conductor sometimes check toilet too and look into toilet. You can try choose relative invisible position in toilet (and other passengers can open the door and see you). Hidden in the toilet is worst in long-journey trains - conductor usually check toilets there. But it is very bad in all type of train.\n\nYou can try walk around the conductor during ticket inspection and go in the area where tickets have been checked. It is much better than stay in the toilet. It is good especially in long-journey EC,IC,EX trains with many carriages and too in local train near city.\n\nAnd one more trick in trains between Bratislava and Kosice, which go through Zilina. This trains have a lot of carriages, and still sometimes crowded. Number of carriages is 10-13 during day with 2-3 conductors and 5-7 carriages during night time with 1-2 conductors. The key is that conductor do not go so often, usually once a 2-5 stations, especially in night trains. You can walk around conductor to area where tickets have been already checked. You can use outside way in some stops or walk around conductor inside train (wait when conductor finish your wagon and return for backpack). Interval to next check is quite long and conductor check new passengers only. You do not answer for new passenger checking (Sleep, look out of window, read a book). But be carefull in station Zilina - this is place for change conductors crew and new conductors checked all passengers. Similar situation is for EC from Prague to Budapest in Slovakian area (From Kuty to Sturovo). Conductor go only one or two times and you can walk around conductor. The similar situation is fror IC and EX trains from Prague to Zilina through Vsetin and Puchov. Conductor go only one or two times and you can change trains in Puchov (train from Bratislava go few minutes after) in Slovakian part. Ticket between last czech and first slovakian stop is quite expensive, and price in train (buy from conductor) can be cheaper than normal. Conductor usually do not go in border Kuty-Breclav but yes in border Horni Lidec - Puchov. If you are captured without ticket, you can be kicked out or conductor ask for paying penalty or your ID in EC train. Because of immigrats and druck, there are usually cops or security in international EC trains and sometimes might check your backpack and pockets (in Czech Area sometimes, especially in trains from Poland). More coops an be in international trains now because of immigrants. Trains between Kosice and Bratislava though Zilina, Trains between Czech Republic and Budapest through Bratislava and trains from Czech to Zilina through Puchov go once a two hours during day time.\n\nJumping in Arctic Circle\n\nThere are four train lines, which goes through Arctic Circle, one in Norway, in Norland between Trondheim and Bodoe, one in Sweden-Norway from Stockholm, Umea to Kiruna, Narvik and two in Finland, first line is from Oulu and Kemi to Rovaniemi and Kemjarvi, second line is from Oulu and Kemi to Kolari.\n\nThere are at least four more train lines in Rusia, that goes behind Arctic Circle. It is Nikel Murmansk linerailway to Murmansk and close to Norwegiad border, with most north stop 69.408 norh. Second line is from Novyj Urengoj to Arctic coast, already est from Ob river. Last station is small tovn by coast 67.910 north. Another railroad behind Arctic circle is by Vorkuta city. Most north stop is village 67.603 north and town 67.599 north. Most north railway in the world is close to island Nova Zemia. It is Obskaya–Bovanenkovo Line that goes from Obskaya (close to Salekhard) north-east to Bovanenkovo region, last stop is Most north station is in small town 70.320 north, last station is Karskaya 70.3168 north. Probably most north railway in America is railway in Alaska from Anchrange to Fairbanks. But Fairbanks station is only 64.851 north, Arctic circle 66.55 north.\n\nThe train line in Norway is by coast and fjords, it is realized by NSB train company. There is a lot of snow in winter and days are short, light is just 1-3 hours long in December. There is quite lot of mountains around and sea too. Summer is with a lot of rain and temperature 10-20. Winter temperature is around zero, from -10 to +5 usually, frost -15 or -20 degrees is rare, sometimes, winter can be colder in Spain or in Greece in mountains.\n\nFrom Oslo, Trondheim to Bodoe, you always have to change train in Trondheim. Lets search for trains from Trondheim to Bodoe. Blue-Black train here can be pretty difficult. You have only one train during day and one train at night. Daily train R or IC (REG 471 at idos.cz) goes from Trondheim S 7:38 and arrives to Bodoe 17:28, so it takes 9:50, almost 10 hours. It is 26 stops and 11 stops are with request only. There are high probability for changing conductors during journey. But conductor all check tickets probably after Trondheim resp. Bodoe and probably not or just few times more far behind Trondheim or Bodoe, but you can try just pretend sleep, conductor do not remember after long time and he does not care so much, who is new.\n\nThis is most north Norwegian train line by NSB, and it goes through Arctic Circle (66.55 degrees or 66 degrees 33 minutes) Arctic circle is between Mo i Rana and Bodoe (60 km north from Mo i Rana), more exactly between Mo i Rana (66.3905 north) and Loensdal (66.7432 north), northest stations are Valnesfjord (67.2995), Tverlandet (67.3019), Moerkved (67.2838), Bodoe (67.2864), northest point of track looks to be by fjord coast (67.3305 north, 15.1567 east).\n\nStops Trondheim-Bodoe REG 471 are: (Trondheim S 7:38 ,Vaernes 8:10-8:11 ,Stjoerdal 8:16-8:17 ,Levanger 9:06-9:07 ,Verdal 9:18-9:19 ,Steinkjer 9:44-9:46 ,Joerstad 10:16-10:17 R ,Snaasa 10:23-10:24 ,Grong 10:50-10:53 ,Harran 11:04-11:05 R ,Lassemoen 11:17-11:18 R ,Namsskogan 11:41-11:42 R ,Majvatn 12:03-12:04 R ,Trofors 12:36-12:37 ,Mosjoeen 13:06-13:09 ,Drevvatn 13:34-13:35 R ,Bjerka 13:55-13:56 ,Mo i Rana 14:17-14:20 ,Loensdal 15:39-15:40 R ,Roekland 16:00-16:01 R ,Rognan 16:14-16:15 ,Fauske 16:37-16:46 ,Valnesfjord 16:53-16:54 R ,Tverlandet 17:10-17:11 R ,Moerkved 17:17-17:18 R ,Bodoe 17:28) R means request stop.\n\nDaily train has a lot of stops and regular checking is probably not so often, there are probably not so many passengers. You can try to hide between passengers or in toilet. You do not need reservation for daily train.\n\nNight train goes 23:40 from Trondheim S to Bodoe 9:15. Type of train is IC or R-Regional (REG 475 at idos.cz). It is 20 stops and 8 stops are request only. Journey takes 9:35. Train stops only for 1-4 minutes at station. There are beds inside and seat reservation obligatory.\n\nStops are REG 475: (Trondheim S 23:40 ,Vaernes 0:05-0:06 ,Stjoerdal 0:10-0:11 ,Levanger 0:50-0:51 ,Verdal 1:03-1:04 ,Steinkjer 1:27-1:29 ,Snaasa 2:06-2:07 R ,Grong 2:37-2:40 ,Namsskogan 3:27-3:28 R ,Trofors 4:24-4:25 ,Mosjoeen 4:54-4:58 ,Bjerka 5:42-5:43 R ,Mo i Rana 6:05-6:08 ,Loensdal 7:26-7:27 R ,Roekland 7:47-7:48 R ,Rognan 8:01-8:02 ,Fauske 8:25-8:30 ,Valnesfjord 8:37-8:38 R ,Tverlandet 8:56-8:57 R ,Moerkved 9:03-9:04 R ,Bodoe 9:15)\n\nBack from Bodoe to Trondheim – situation is the same. One daily train REG 472 and one night train REG 476 only (IC or R at departure board and REG at www.idos.cz). The daily train goes from Bodoe 12:27 to Trondheim S 22:05. Duration is 9:38. It is 26 stops with 11 request stops. There are probably not so many people in train and there is probability of conductor changing during journey.\n\nREG 472: (Bodoe 12:27 , Moerkved 12:32-12:33 R, TVERLANDET 12:40-12:41 R, Valnesfjord 12:56-12:57 R, Fauske 13:08-13:11 , Rognan 13:31-13:32 , Roekland 13:39-13:40 R, Loensdal 14:06-14:07 R, Dunderland 14:48-14:56 , Mo i Rana 15:28-15:31 , Bjerka 15:51-15:52 , Drevvatn 16:11-16:12 R, Mosjoeen 16:38-16:41 , Trofors 17:11-17:12 , Majvatn 17:45-17:46 R, Namsskogan 18:07-18:08 R, Lassemoen 18:31-18:32 R, Harran 18:43-18:44 R, Grong 18:58-19:07 , Snaasa 19:33-19:34 , Joerstad 19:37-19:38 R, Steinkjer 20:13-20:16 , Verdal 20:37-20:38 , Levanger 20:53-20:54 , Stjoerdal 21:32-21:33 , Vaernes 21:34-21:35 , Trondheim S 22:05) R means request stop.\n\nNight train from Bodoe to Trondheim – situation is the same. There are beds and seat reservation obligatory, probably not so many passengers. You can try to hide in the dark coupe and pretended sleeping, but chance of success is dubious (or more persons inside one sleeping bag or one blanket can go with one ticket). Night train goes from Bodoe 21:10 to Trondheim S 7:47. It is REG 476 at idos.cz. Duration is 10:30 and it is 20 stops, 8 request stops include. Train wait at stops from 1 to 13 minutes.\n\nREG 476: (Bodoe 21:10 , Moerkved 21:15-21:16 R, TVERLANDET 21:23-21:24 R, Valnesfjord 21:40-21:41 R, Fauske 21:54-21:58 , Rognan 22:18-22:19 , Roekland 22:26-22:27 R, Loensdal 22:57-22:58 R, Mo i Rana 0:13-0:20 , Bjerka 0:40-0:41 R, Mosjoeen 1:30-1:40 , Trofors 2:09-2:10 , Namsskogan 3:15-3:28 , Grong 4:23-4:26 , Snaasa 4:53-4:54 R, Steinkjer 5:37-5:40 , Verdal 6:02-6:03 , Levanger 6:14-6:15 , Stjoerdal 7:04-7:05 , Vaernes 7:06-7:07 , Trondheim S 7:47) R is request stop.\n\nThe second line is in Sweden, from Boden to Kiruna, Narvik. It goes throught Stockhlm, Gavle, Hudiksvall, Sundsvall, Umea, Boden-Lulea, Kiruna, Narvik. This is most north train line in Shenghen or European Union. There are plenty trains from Stockholm to Gavle, Hudiksvall, Sundsvall, a lot of high-speed trains SJ SnabbTaag and long journey trains (SJ IC, SJ Nattaget, Arctic circle train). Some SJ SnabbTaag goes more north to Umea and there are SJ IC, SJ Orviga ,SJ Nattaget (night train) and local Norrtaag from Umea to Boden and Lulea.\n\nIt is 6 stops between Sundsvall and Umea with SJ Snabbtaag or night trains NZ 91, NZ 92 (NZ 91 and NZ 92 goes between Goteborg, Stockholm and Lulea – SJ Nattaget at departure board). Stops are: (Sundsvall, Timraa, Härnösand, Kramfors, Örnsköldsvik C, Umeaa Östra, Umeaa Central). From Stockholm-Sundsvall to Umea goes one SJ Snabbstaag in morning and 2-3 trains SJ Snabbtaag in afternoon-evening. From Umea goes one SJ Snabbstaag at early morning, one at morning and one at afternoon. NZ 92 goes at early morning 2:58 from Sundsvall and NZ 91 at evening 22:26 from Umea. NZ 91 and NZ 92 can be marked like R 91 and R 91 between Sundsvall and Luleaa at idos.cz and SJ Orviga at departure board.\n\nThere is once a 1-3 hours local train Norrtaag between Sundsvall and Umea, but it is 11 stops and many stops can be without waiting room. Temperature -30C is possible already there. Stops with Norrtaag are: (Umeaa Central, Umeaa Östra, Hörnefors, Nordmaling, Husum(S), Örnsköldsvik Norra, Örnsköldsvik C, Kramfors, Härnösand, Timraa, Sundsvall Västra, Sundsvall Central ). There is SJ Nattaget night train Arctic circle train (NZ 94 to Narvik and NZ 93 to Stockholm only with 4 stops (Sundsvall Central, Härnösand station , Kramfors, Örnsköldsvik C, Umeaa Central). NZ 94 goes at evening 22:34 from Sundsvall and NZ 93 goes at early morning (1:19) from Umea.\n\ntrain from Umeaa to Boden is more difficult, because there are not so many trains. There are only two night trains quite early morning and one train during day. One is NZ 92 from from Umea 6:30 to Boden and Lulea, which can be marked at idos cz too like blue regional R 92 from Sundsvall, Umeaa to Boden, Lulea. This train has 5 stops (Umeaa Central, Vindeln, Bastuträsk, Jörn, Älvsbyn, Boden, Sunderby sjukhus, Luleaa Central). And there is of course night train NZ 94 Arctic Circle train with 4 stops only (Umeaa Central, Bastuträsk, Jörn, Älvsbyn, Boden). There is once a day regional train R 7108 Norrtaag Umea C 16:11 – Boden C 19:27 with 8 stops from Umeaa to Boden, 3 more stops to Lulea central 20:05. Stops are (Umeaa Central, Vannasby, Tvaralund, Vindeln, Hällnäs, Bastuträsk, Jörn, Älvsbyn, Boden, Sunderby sjukhus, Luleaa Notviken, Luleaa Central) So there is only one train per day in some stops and many stations can be without waiting room. Death during exam is possible here. In winter can be -30 degrees often here. All stops extra are between Umea and first stop (Vindeln) Bastuträsk, except Hällnäs. Hällnäs is strange too, only one train Norrtaag to direction Boden, Lulea stops here. From Boden to Umeaa goes at night NZ 93 Arctic Circle train with 4 stops from Boden 21:55 (Boden, Älvsbyn, Jörn, Bastuträsk, Umeaa) and R 91 (SJ Orviga) from Boden 18:25 with 5 stops (Boden, Älvsbyn, Jörn, Bastuträsk, Vindeln, Umeaa). R 91(NZ 91 or NZ 3291) continues to Kramfors and Härnösand (Sundsvall, Stockholm, Goteborg). There is only once a day in early morning one local train R 7103 Norrtaag with 7 stops. Two more stops are between Vindeln and Umeaa. All stops: (Boden, Älvsbyn, Jörn, Bastuträsk, Vindeln,Tvaralund, Vannasby, Umeaa). All extra-stops are close to Umeaa too.\n\nBoden is big crossroad of train lines'. One direction by train and road is to Lulea. It is 1-3 stops and trains goes quite often, in morning and afternoon-evening every 1-2 hours, but no train 11-14 h. There are Long journey SJ IC trains (IC at idos.cz), night trains SJ Nattaget (NZ at idos.cz) and trains SJ Orviga (R at idos.cz) in Boden. From Lulea is road like motorway to Finland, but no train. You can check hitchhicking places at map. First train station with good connection is Kemi and it is one stop and 58 minutes between Kemi and Oulu.\n\nBetween Boden and Kiruna. SJ IC trains goes between Lulea-Boden-Kirina-Narvik (IC 95 from Kiruna, Narvik and IC 96 to Kiruna, Narvik) with four stops and there are long journey trains between Stockholm and Narvik (NZ 94 Arctic Circle train in early morning to Kiruna, Narvik and NZ 93 Arctic Circle train in afternoon-evening from Narvik, Kiruna to Boden, Stockholm) with the same four stops between Boden and Kiruna. Stops for SJ IC and SJ Nattaget (IC and NZ at idos.cz) are: (Boden, Murjek, Nattavaara, Gällivare, Kiruna), journey takes about 3:05-3:40 hours. There are during day 3 regional trains in each direction (one in morning and two in afternoon) Norrtaag train company. Norrtaag train has usually only 4 same stops too, like with long journey trains, BUT one Norrtaag train per day has 3 extra stops (R 7154 Norrtaag Lulea 16:30 Boden 17:03 Kiruna 20:07 and R 7151 Norrtaag Kiruna 6:20 Boden 9:27-9:29 Lulea 9:52) R 7154 and R 7151 has three more stops between Gällivare and Kiruna - (Fjällaasen, Kaitum, Sjisjka). How many stations are with waiting room is dubious, but waiting room can be closed at night. And there are three stations, where is easy to stack whole night or day. Especially in these dangerous stations with only one train per day in one direction - Death during exam is possible here, in case, that you fail. Temperature in winter can be there easily -30 and rarely -40.\n\nBetween Kiruna and Narvik. This is area with mountains and lakes and many small villages and resorts. Narvik has quite mild winter with temperature from -10 to -15, sometimes -15, but rarely -20 and mountains divide warm Atlantic air and cold continental air. There are big temperature differences in small distances or between valley and hill. There are two trains per day in one direction between Kiruna and Narvik. It is 7 or 8 or 11 stops between Kiruna and Narvik. train NZ 94 Arctic circle train (SJ Nattaget) from Stocholm to Narvik (Stockholm 17:29, Kiruna 9:36-9:54 , Narvik 12:29, 7 stops) and from Narvik to Stockholm (NZ 93 Arctic circle train Narvik 15:15, Kiruna 17:58-18:25, Sockholm 9:15, 8 stops). Second train is with 11 stops, IC 96 from Lulea-Boden-Kiruna to Narvik (IC 96 Kiruna 14:19-14:45 and Narvik 17:45, 11 stops) and IC 95 from Narvik to Kiruna-Boden-Lulea (IC 95 Narvk 11:00, Kiruna 13:43-14:02).\n\nMany stations should be with waiting room, but some stations have waiting room open nonstop. Some stations has only one train per day in one direction. There are few skiing centers, like Abisko. Oceanic side of mountains is warmer, but there still can be -15 or even -20. Valleys in mountains and area around Kiruna can be very cold, sometimes -30 or even -40 degrees and death during exam is possible here.\n\nRiksgränsen station (68.4266 north) is station by SE-NO border (in Sweden, 1 km from border). Bjoernfjell is first station in Norway, about 1.5 km from border. This train line is most north at all in Europe, except Russia. Another three train lines goes about 67 degrees only. But train line between Kiruna and Narvik crosses 68 degrees north.\n\nSearching for most north position by GoogleMaps: One of most north point E10 (68.443 north, 18.609 east) and railway (68.43405 north,18.5986 east) is close to big lakes, north-west from tornehamn and Björklidens Golfklubb in Sweden (there is hotel and maybe some good dumpsters too). The second northest possibility is E10 (68.4343, 18.2513) and railway (68.4305, 18.2482) is close to Vassijaure station (68.4290, 18.2603). In Norway is far north station Haugfjell (68.4405, 18.0180) and nordest rail point close to this station (68.4441,18.0481) and Narvik (68.4416, 17.4414). And by fjourd and Atlantic coast, most north place of train line was found. Most north railway (68.4516,17.483) resp. (68.4502,17.5420) and northern E10 is on another place before coast (68.5163,17.8727). NO-SE border on the track is (68.4300, 18.1057) and by E10 (68.4352, 18.1068).\n\nPosition of Stations Kiruna-Narvik by openstreetmaps.org: Kiruna station (67.8677, 20.2000), Abisko Östra Station (68.3490, 18.8288), Abisko Turiststation (68.3574, 18.7825), Björkliden station (68.4065, 18.6858), Laaktatjaakka station (68.4237, 18.3242), Vassijaure station (68.4296, 18.2577), Katterjaakk station (68.4198, 18.1613), Riksgränsen station (68.4266, 18.1207), Bjoernfjell ( 68.4318, 18.0739), Katterat (68.3975, 17.9658), Rombakk (68.4038, 17.7914), Straumsnes unused station (68.4340, 17.6566), Narvik (68.4417, 17.4414). Nordest point of train line close to Narvik (68.4517, 17.4986) and (68.4517, 17.4808), and second nordesr point is between Katterat and Rombakk - (68.4441, 18.0484), SE-NO border rail is (68.4301, 18.1057).\n\nNZ 94 Arctic Circle Train (Stockholm Central 17:29 BO, Arlanda Central 17:50 17:53 BO, Uppsala Central 18:14 18:21 BO, Gävle Central 19:23 19:26, Söderhamn station 20:23, Hudiksvall station 21:16 21:21, Sundsvall Central 22:19 22:34, Härnösand station 23:23, Kramfors 23:52, Örnsköldsvik C 0:44, Umeaa Central 1:40 1:50, Bastuträsk station 3:23, Jörn station 3:46, Älvsbyn station 4:45 4:46, Boden Centralstation 5:24 5:51, Murjek station 7:23, Nattavaara station 7:50, Gällivare station 8:24, KIRUNA STATION 9:36 9:54, Abisko Östra Station 10:57, Abisko Turiststation 11:02, Björkliden station 11:12, Katterjaakk station 11:36, Riksgränsen station 11:41, Katterat 11:59 12:00, Narvik 12:29 GO)\n\nNZ 93 Arctic Circle Train (Narvik 15:15 BO, Katterat 15:42 15:43, Bjoernfjell 15:59 16:00, Riksgränsen station 16:04, Katterjaakk station 16:10, Björkliden station 16:31, Abisko Turiststation 16:41, Abisko Östra Station 16:47, KIRUNA STATION 17:58 18:25, Gällivare station 19:34, Nattavaara station 20:08, Murjek station 20:41 20:42, Boden Centralstation 21:38 21:55, Älvsbyn station 22:24, Jörn station 23:25, Bastuträsk station 23:48, Umeaa Central 1:15 1:19, Örnsköldsvik C 2:17, Kramfors 3:03, Härnösand station 3:31, Sundsvall Central 4:24 4:35, Hudiksvall station 5:39, Söderhamn station 6:18 6:29, Gävle Central 7:25 7:27, Uppsala Central 8:26 8:33 GO, Arlanda Central 8:51 8:54 GO, Stockholm Central 9:15 GO)\n\nIC 96 (Luleaa Central 10:00 BO, Sunderby sjukhus station 10:11 BO, Boden Centralstation 10:26 10:35, Murjek station 11:50, Nattavaara station 12:14, Gällivare station 12:46, KIRUNA STATION 14:19 14:45, Abisko Östra Station 15:54, Abisko Turiststation 15:59, Björkliden station 16:08, Laaktatjaakka station 16:31, Vassijaure station 16:36 16:41, Katterjaakk station 16:47, Riksgränsen station 16:52, Bjoernfjell 16:57 16:58, Katterat 17:13 17:14, Rombakk 17:25 17:26, Narvik 17:45 GO)\n\nIC 95 (Narvik 11:00 BO, Rombakk 11:19, Katterat 11:30, Bjoernfjell 11:44 11:45, Riksgränsen station 11:49, Katterjaakk station 11:55, Vassijaure station 12:02, Laaktatjaakka station 12:06, Björkliden station 12:20, Abisko Turiststation 12:29, Abisko Östra Station 12:35, KIRUNA STATION 13:43 14:02, Gällivare station 15:20, Nattavaara station 16:02, Murjek station 16:30, Boden Centralstation 17:42, Sunderby sjukhus station 18:12 18:13 GO, Luleaa Central 18:22 GO)\n\nThird journey through Arctic circle is in Finland. It goes from Oulu to Rovaniemi and Kemijärvi. There are three daily IC trains and two night IC trains. Daily ICs are one from-to Helsinki, one from-to Kuopio and one just from-to Oulu. Night trains are from-to Helsinki. Rovaniemi is last big city with quite good train connection. Rovaniemi station is still not behind Arctic Circle, it is 66.4980 north, Arctic circle is 66.55 north, it goes through most north houses in Rovaniemi. train line continues east-east-north with two stops Misi and Kemijärvi. These stops are behind Arctic circle already. But only one train per day goes in one direction from-to Misi (66.6179 north) and Kemijärvi (66.7243 north),. It is night train between Helsinki and Kemijärvi. train line continues from Kemijärvi to east-east-north to Murmansk in Russia, without trains. Some HOBO (Freight train) can go there with wood. But Russia is with hard passports and visa checking and it is really violent country. Trains that goes from-to Kemijärvi, has only one stop between Oulu and Rovaniemi, it is Kemi (Crossroad). All other trains stops: (Oulu (Uleaborg), Kemi, Tervola, Muurola, Rovaniemi).\n\nIC 265 Night train From Helsinki (Oulu (Uleaborg) 4:50 4:57, Kemi 6:03 6:07, Rovaniemi 7:28 7:40, Misi 8:16 8:17, Kemijärvi 8:45) IC 273 Night train from Helsinki (Oulu (Uleaborg) 7:19 7:43, Kemi 8:47 8:51, Tervola 9:32 9:33, Muurola 10:19 10:20, Rovaniemi 10:40) IC 711 from Kuopio (Oulu (Uleaborg) 12:24 12:27, Rovaniemi 17:17) IC 415 from Oulu (Oulu (Uleaborg) 18:30, Rovaniemi 20:44) IC 27 from Helsinki (Oulu (Uleaborg) 20:52 20:56, Rovaniemi 23:34) IC 22 to Helsinki (Rovaniemi 5:55, Oulu (Uleaborg) 8:15 8:33) IC 414 to Oulu (Rovaniemi 9:27, Oulu (Uleaborg) 11:50) IC 416 to Oulu (Rovaniemi 12:09, Oulu (Uleaborg) 14:23) IC 710 to Kuopio (Rovaniemi 15:18, Oulu (Uleaborg) 17:37 17:42) IC 266 Night train to Helsinki (Rovaniemi 18:03, , Oulu (Uleaborg) 20:55 21:23) IC 274 Night train to Helsinki (Kemijärvi 19:45, Misi 20:11 20:12, Rovaniemi 20:50 21:15, Kemi 22:30 22:33, Oulu (Uleaborg) 23:36 23:42)\n\nPosition of stations by openstreetmaps.org: Oulu (65.0114, 25.4842), Kemi (65.7368, 24.5745), Tervola (66.0816, 24.7721), Muurola (66.3707, 25.3753), Rovaniemi (66.4980, 25.7053), Misi (66.6179, 26.6865), Kemijärvi (66.7243, 27.4035).\n\nThe last journey is from Oulu, Kemi to Kolari. Kolari is most north Finish station. Kemi is crossroad for roads and trains to direction Kolari, Rovaniemi and Oulu. It is only one stop between Oulu and Kemi and 3 or 1 stops between Kemi and Rovaniemi. There is road-highway between Oulu (FI) – Kemi (FI) and Luleaa (SE), Boden (SE) around Baltic Sea. First Swedish train station is Luleaa. There is no train line through SE-FI border, only buses and cars goes there.\n\nBy idos.cz - From Kolari to south (to Helsinki) goes only few trains, like Ex 270 and Ex 272. Ex 270 goes only 29-30th April and 17th June and Ex 272 goes only 1st May and 15th, 18th June. Both are night trains with beds and wagon for cars.\n\nTrains between Oulu and Kolari seems to be extreme rare. There are only few days at spring with express night train between Helsinki and Kolari. There can be some HOBO (freight train) with wood, but it is possible only in Summer, of course. Stops are: (Oulu, Kemi, Tornio Itäinen, Ylitornio, Pello, Kolari). Tornio Itäinen is station by Baltic coast and SE-FI border. But there are almost no trains, so closest good station is Kemi. train line between and Kolari is by Sweden-Finland border and river.\n\nPosition of stations by openstreetmaps.org: Oulu (65.0114, 25.4842), Kemi (65.7368, 24.5745), Tornio Itäinen (65.8508, 24.18293), Ylitornio ( 66.3244, 23.6825), Pello (66.7843, 23.9928), Kolari (67.3488, 23.8360). Arctic circle (66.55) is between Ylitornio and Pello.\n\nNorth Finland – Lapland is mostly lowland (like almost whole Finland) with plenty of lakes. But west part of Lapland is with mountains. Finland is most east Scandinavian country too, and mountains blocked warm air from Atlantic, but cold an in Russia is not so far. That's why in north-Finland (Lapland) is sometimes extreme cold. If Siberian high spread, then is in Finland clear and super cold. There can e like winter extreme around -35 or -40 in few days, -30 is quite often behind Arctic circle. It can be bellow -40 rarely. Ussual winter temperature in north Finland is 0C to -25C . Day length is in winter just 2-5 hours close to Arctic Circle (icluding twillight, Sun is still bellow horizon), but there is never-ended light in June. Summer is with plenty of mosquitoes. Many stations in Finland have not waiting room, only big stations have waiting room (and waiting room is closed at night).\n\nThen Death during exam is possible in case, that you fail and waiting room is not in your stop (or waiting room is closed at night). You can tell that you have no place to sleep and if you are polite, conductor can let you travel, or he can give you fine, which you don't need to pay (Sweden SEK 1200, Finland Eur 80, Norway NOK 1150). Or conductor can call police, if you refuse to leave train, and police will let you be at their station during night.\n\nThere is really short, but northernmost Scandinavian railway in Norway, by Kirkenes too, it is only from Bjornevatn mine (69.6565,30.0075) to harbour-coast, 8.484 long. By harbour is most north point of this railway, (69.7258,30.0299) Kirkenes statio (69.7220, 30.0326), Bjornevatn station in the mine (69.6683. 29.9979).\n\nOther train lines behind Arctic Circle are not in Scandinavian countries, but in Russia. One of northernmost train lines is close to Finland. You need visa to Russia and it can be hard to get visa. Trains in Russia are relative cheap, iit can be difficult to take it for free. However, the ticket for smaller distance, than you travel can work until conductor change. Trains with reservation obligatory are dubious.\n\nFar north train line is from St. Pettersburg to Murmansk. Murmansk is harbour for cargo at the fjord from Barent sea and lot of freight trains go to Murmask too, cargo from ships to trains is taken there. Position of Murmansk station is (68.972,33.068). Harbour for ships is next to train station. Railway continues more north by Fjord, there are two stops behind Murmansk. Names are in Asbuka, but coordinates are: first stop is north of Murmansk (69.020,33.097) and second stop is north-east from Murmansk, at the end of main railway (69.056,33.377). Railway splits by this place to three branches to town and to military area. Most north point before last stop by some town is (69.064,33.353), by road (47K-079). Most north point after last stop is by the town and fjord, at the end of north branch of railway (69.079,33.402).\n\nHowever, the most north station and railway in this region is not by Murmansk, but railway close to Norwegian border Nikel Murmansk line. About 10 km before Murmansk, in station 1437 KM railway splits to Murmansk and to north-west. Railway continues first south-west to first station (68.8200,32.8179). Next stop is small village (68.969,32.454). At (68.989,32.419) railway split to north to military area and to north-west. Next stops are small villages (69.078,32.123), (69.189,31.694), (69.268,31.245). Next stop is by some mine, and town (69.400,31.106). In this station railway splits to west - to mine, military area, and more far to west with two stops (69.408,30.795) and (69.420,30.257). Main route continues to north-north-west.\n\nMain branch of Murmansk Nikel Line continues to north, to last and northernmost stop (69.5095,31.1630). Railway continues from last stop about 7-10km little bit more north by road P21 and it ends close to swamp, military area and hospital. The railway (with no stops anymore) ends at (69.5695,31.2294), next to road 47K-081. It is not so far from Norwegian border, about 10 km directly. Road P21 continues to border and to Norway, it continue like E105 in Norway, E105 meets with E6 close to Kirkenes. E6 is main Norwegian road from Kirkenes to Oslo and Malmo (SE). There is plan tho connect this railway in Russia with 8.5 log railway from mine to Kirkenes. It means to build 25 km of new railway and it can cost about EUR 1 billion.\n\nRussia is not so free country and traveling by train for free can me more dangerous than in Europe, like everything. You can get into trouble much more easily than in Scandinavia. However many people in Russia try to taking train for free, including train hoping. Railway to Murmansk and close to Norway is more far from sea with more continental climate, and temperature in winter here is ussually -10 to -25, sometimes bellow -30, seldomly -40 or even -45 degrees. And some stations are without waiting room. Probability of being kicked out is bigger than in European countries and it is more dangerous than in Scandinavia, like everything in Russia.\n\nThere is another railway in Russia, which goes behind Arctic circle. It is south from Nova Zemia island, on the way Konosa - Kotlas - Vorkuta - Salechard There is some circle from main railroad by Vorkuta, and there is most north place. Two most north stations are some villages (67.603,63.911) and (67.597,64.107) Vorkuta station is by OSM (67.470,64.027). Most north point of railway is (67.609,64.076) by some cargo place and depo with most north point of depo (67.612,64.083). The crossroad with nord ring and main railway Konosa-Kotlas-Sachelad is (67.112,63.302), already behind Arctic circle.\n\nNorthernmost railway in the world is Obskaya–Bovanenkovo Line, from Obskaya to Yamal peninsula, to Bovanenkovo and Karskaya, behind 70 degrees north en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Obskaya%E2%80%93Bovanenkovo_Line It is connected to main railway Konosa - Kotlas - Vorkuta - Salechard in Obskaya. The end of railway (70.3211,68.3715) is south from town Bovanenkovo, northernmost point is between third last and second last stop (70.3265,68.8329). Last three stops are: Small village (70.2942,68.938), some stop by small road (70.320,68.754), and Karskaya station (70.3168, 68.3909)- south from Bovanenkovo town and close to airport. This railway was built first Obskaya–Bovanenkovo area (to mine) 525 km long, it was extended to Karskaya after, railway is 572 km long. There is plan for extend it to Kharasavey, it will be 678 km long railway. Railway contains 3.8929 km long Yuribey Bridge - longest bridge behind Arctic circle (68.919,69.840 by Wiki). Most north point of railway is by Wiki (70.3750 68.6700) - quite different from OSM.\n\nYamal peninsula is even much colder in Winter, than Lappland. Many stations are just small villages without any house and trains don't go so often here, it can be less often than from-to Kolari or Kemjarvi. Winter temperature is here usually from -20 to -35 and -40 is still quite common. Sometimes can be here -45 or even -50.\n\nThere is another railway, that goes behind Arctic circle - north from Novyj Urengoj. Main railway is in west siberia, Tjumen - Surgut - Novyj Urengoj - Nadym. This main railway has most north point in Novyj Urengoj city (66.097,76.752). Station Novyj Urengoj (66.090,76.691) is with quite big depo, there is crossroad to north,west-south. However it is not behind Arctic circle, Arctic circle is 66.55. From Novyj Urengoj goes railway north, towards fjord of Arctic Ocean. Most north point of railway is close to end (67.9124,74.9148), end is (67.9051,74.8245), most north point of branch in depo at the end is (67.9136,74.8986) resp. (67.9136,74.8643).\n\nThe last station is in town by Arctic coast, it is located (67.9103,74.901). Second last station is just behind this town (67.9015,75.058), third last station is small place (67.797,75.326). 4th last station is small village quite far, but with bigger platform (66.898,75.982), 5th last station is just some depo-platform by Novyj Urengoj (66.154,76.700). It is only 5 stations from Novyj Urengoj to end. Stations are small. Here is already west-central Siberia and here is temperature in winter usually -20 to -40, but sometimes during cold vawe bellow -50 can be in this region. It is much colder than Scandinavia.\n\nSecond most north railway in Russia is Norilsk railway in central Siberia, south Taymyr region en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norilsk_railway. It begins in Dudinka town by huge Yensey river. Begin of Railway is (69.4155,86.158) - Morskyy port - harbour by river. First station is Dudinka (69.408,86.249) and it continuse from Dudinka Station to Norilsk Station 88 km. Norilsk station is located (69.3569,88.1364). From Norilsk station railway continues to north, to Talnakh station (69.4832, 88.3989, 27 km from Norilsk) and last 11 km to Taymyr mine. But there is no more stop after Talnahk, just most north point of main rail (69.510,88.363) and most north point of railway to mine (69.5424,88.3070) resp. (69.5382,88.4677). Railway is just isolated around Norilsk area (it is not connected to other railways), it have more branches and total length is 253 km by Wiki.\n\nNorilsk area and Taymir is located in north-central Siberia. It means that there is quite short Summer, with only around 5-20 degrees. It is huge lowland with big rivers (Yenisey and Ob more west) with lakes and swamps everywhere around. There are plenty of mosquitoes everywhere in Summer, much worse than in Lapland. It is here central Siberia and winter here is totally different than in Scandinavia. It is not so much windy, but ussual winter temperature is here from -20 to -45 and sometimes, during cold vawe can be bellow -50. Taymyr is northernmost region, with most north point in Asia and Eurasia - Nordkapp of Russia and Eurasia is much more north than northernmost point of Alaska or Scandinavia. It is edge of Taymyr (77.7233,104.2540). Only small villages and small roads are in Taymyr peninsula, probably not in northernmost parts. It is not toursit place, like nordkapp in Norway.\n\nMost north rail road in North America is in Alaska - The Alaska Railroad Between Anchorange (south coast) to Fairbanks (middle of Alaska). However this rail road never goes behind Arctic circle. Most north point of railway is (64.9261,-148.0758) and most north station is Fairbanks at the end (64.8511,-147.7403). But it is not heated by Gulf stream, like Scandinavia. Temperature around Fairbanks is usually -15 to -35, but sometimes bellow -40. Railway to Fairbaks is northernmost railway in America. Northernmost railway in Canada is to Churchill, by big lake and Hay river freight station (60.8434,-115.7607), railway ends (60.8577,-115.7343) But it is not rail for people, only for freight trains (It means that HOBO is possible). Churchill Railway station is (58.7678,-94.1743), railway ends (58.7815,-94.1970).\n\nThe Railway with coldest Winter is not so north, it is quite far south from Arctic Circle (66.55). Railway with Coldest winters is in East Siberia, around Baikal, Mongolia, and towards Vladivostok. It is part of Trans-Siberian Railway Moscow-Vladivostok. Trans-baikal railway until Yurty station (56.041,97.636) and East Siberian Railway after. Railway goes Krasnojarsk-Bratsk-Uts-Kurt-Nizneangarsk (by North of Baikal lake)-Tynda-Urgal (BAM from Yurty station). There is some short branch before Krasnojarsk to Lesosibirsk (8.2290,92.4709) and before Ust-Kurt shor branch to Ust-Limsk (58.369,97.090). This Area around Yurty is very cold. Winter tempereature here is usually -30 to -45 and sometimes bellow -50, especially in Yurty. Yurty is small town with about 6000 inhabitants. Most north point of main Trans-Siberian Railway is more east (57.0885,118.938), before station Tynda (55.1393,124.7391). From Tynda to Urgal railway goes already more close to Pacific ocean and winter are not so cold. Tynda is more east and north, it but not so high. There is usually during winter from -25 to -45, sometomes bellow -50. The coldest region in Siberia is around Verchojansk-Ojmjakon, from Tynda north-east few hundersts of kilometers. There is January temperature usually around -35 to -55. From Tynda goes railway north quite far to Tommot ( 58.9675, 126.2267) and Nizhny Bestyakh. Railway station (61.8675,129.9574) is south from town Nizhny Bestyakh (61.96,129.92). Most north point of line in depo is (61.8825,129.981). This station Nizhny Bestyakh is most north railway in East Siberia probably and it should be coldest railway station in the world. Temperature here is in winter from -30 to -50, sometimes even bellow -55. Yurty is one of coldest place too. However coldest average during winter is in Ojmjakon north-east from Nizhny Bestyakh. (There is in winter usually from -35 to -55, sometimes -60). But there is no railway station in Ojmjakon (63.462,142.786) or anywhere around. There is more south railway Yurty-Irkustk (South of Baikal lake)-Ulan-Ude (Line to Ulanbaatar in MOngolia and Being in China)-Cita (line to Being, China)-Never-Tynda. This railway is more south, but more in mountains. Coldest railway in the world should be line to Nizhny Bestyakh and around Yurty too. It is far south from Arctic Cirle (66.55), but East Siberia is very cold.\n\nDenmark\n\nDenmark is very flat country with a lot of sea around. There are very good hitchbility and trains going in Denmark too co course. But there is a lot of rain in Denmark (quite expectable for coastal places), not so ideal for sleeping outside and hitchhiking. So if you want to jump, it is possible. There are no information about stops during journey or map with trains in railway station, so it is quite difficult to find good journey and orientation for non-local people is difficult. Only information about departure and final destination and type of trains are availaible.\n\nRegional trains have distance between stops about 5-15 km and interval to next train is about one hour. These trains have few carriages and number of passengers is medium or not so much. IC trains have distance between stops about 15-40 km (EC trains have longer distances between stops). IC trains go usually once per hour and there are about 3-8 wagons and a lot of passengers.\n\nConductor (blue jumper) go after every station and he checks only new passengers quite quickly. There are about two wagons per conductor and ticket inspection is quite fast after station. He usually do not think so much about who is new passenger. So if your appearance is not so unusual, you only stay or sit somewhere and be reading a book or be looking out of window and do not do anything during control. But it do not work after first stop – at the begin of journey, of course.\n\nYou can very easily use short distance ticket trick (favourite jump style in central Europe). You just buy ticket only for one or two station and you show it to conductor, but do not get of at the end of ticket and you continue journey. Standard ticket price is about 1 danish crown per 1 km, it is Eur 3 per 30 km or 6-8 Eur per 100 km, so it is quite expensive for poor people, but not for local residents.\n\nConductor usually do not check toilets. So when you see that conductor is coming, you go to toilet, lock or do not lock the door and play shitting, hold toilet paper etc. You just go out of toilet after control. But in EC and IC trains are a lot of passengers and passengers go to toilet quite often and you can not hide there because somebody already use it. So it is standard situation – you want to hide during ticket inspection and toilets are with somebody. You can try to walk around conductor or just sit or stay and be looking out of window. Because of conductor have only two carriages usually and check new passengers every stops, walking around conductor to area, where tickets have been already checked do not work correctly.\n\nIf black jumprs (travelers without ticket) have not so good train skills and they are captured, they usually have not been kicked out of train without penalty. Conductor ask them for ID (Passport, Driving licence or identity card). If you refuse to give ID, conductor probably want to call cops. You can try to get more and more time to next stop and you go out of train in next stop, but if you are in EC or IC train, conductor have enough time for writing penalty or calling cops. The fine is Danish Crown 750 (about Eur 100) and it is written in all stops and railways. If you are not Danish, just show identity card. Conductor probably takes only your name and surname and your country, probably not your address or birth date. This is not exact identification of course.\n\nIf you loose on the train - the penalty is your ticket and you can continue with penalty until final station (penalty price do not depend to distance, just tell to conductor your final destination). But you can not use the penalty or classic ticket to next train (You have to change trains sometimes during journey and penalty is not transfer ticket. Ticket are sold by automatic machines, these machines work with coins and credit cards. But you usually can buy ticket only for one train, strange). Good journey is for example from Flensburg (German-Danish border) to Alborg (North Denmark). Through Frederica and Arhaus. There are about 5-7 stops between Frederica and Arhaus and only 3 stops from Arhaus to Alborg for IC trains. But it means too, that conductor have enough time for writing penalty. If you get penalty, you can take with this penalty whole journey for example from Flensburg to Alborg. It is you ticket.\n\nPeterOB travelled in Denmark in August 2015 and he use train too, because it was windy and rain whole day – not so good weather for hitchhiking. PeterOB was train from Kolding to Alborg in North trough Frederica. He was hiding in toilet (he did not lock door, sit and hold toilet paper) or he just stay and look out of window. He do not met conductor in train from Kolding to Frederica. 7 stops from Frederica to Arhaus was more difficult. PeterOB combined toilet tactic and just looking out of window. But only two carriages go from Arhaus to Alborg and PeterOB have to change place in train. New conductor start checking tickets, PeterOB want to go to toilet but there was already somebody. So PeterOB walked around conductor and when conductor went back, he asked for a ticket and wrote penalty for PeterOB. There is a lot of time from Arhaus to first station Randers. So this jump action was not succesfull and PeterOB went with penalty to final destination. But he will never pay the penalty DKK 750 (About Eur 100).\n\nAs you know, Denmark is very rich country and supermarkets waste a lot of food. Trash bins are easily accessible and there are a lot of fruits, vegetables, bread, some sweets and milk product. You can easily eat a lot of food from trash-bins everywhere in Denmark. So if you have not enough jump skills and you are kicked out of train, just find some meal in trash.\n\nFinland\n\nFinland is country in or close to Scandinavia, on the another side of Baltic Sea. People in Finland are one of most peaceful and kind in Europe and it is really hippie area. It is easy to live without money there.\n\nDumpsters close to supermarkets are quite accessible, at especially in Helsinki region. Hitchhiking can be good or bad. But the climate a nature is not so friendly, especially in the north. Summer is relative warm, but with lot of rain and attacking swarms of mosquitoes in the north (it is not so bad in the south). Winter is with pretty short days and super-cold arctic waves (war air from Atlantic is blocked by Scandinavian mountains but continental Arctic air from Russia can flow to Finland easily). Temperature can easily drop bellow -20 or -25 in south, -30 or -35 in the middle and in Lapland can be -30 to -40 or even bellow -40 rarely.\n\nHERE ARE TRAIN SCHEDULES FOR LONG_JOURNEY TRAINS IN FINLAND Train schedules changes by time by minutes or even hours, but number of train, stops during journey, type of train and gear, and how often trains goes to target per day - it stay. For example IC 27 starts in afternoon in Helsinki (after 3pm) and it is in Rovanimemi at night (before midnight). But exact time of departures can be changed during updating.\n\nAt first – How to get to Finland. There are three ways, how to get there. Unfortunately, most of Finland border are with Russia and with Baltic sea. The traveling through Russia is not free or easily possible. You need visa. Visa to Russia cost around Eur 50-100 and it can be difficult with office. So there is no way (hitchhiking, bus, train) through Tallin-Saint Petersburg – Helsinki. There is ferry between Tallinn and Helsinki, it is not so long journey and the price begins from Eur 12 for walkers and they write down ID. You can try to sneek on ferry between people (a lot of people are there in Friday and Sunday) or you can be hidden in someone's car. Getting from Poland to Tallin is relative long journey, but a lot of truck goes there. No train is on this way and hitchhiking between Poland and Estonia is sometimes good, but sometimes bad. Hitchhiking in Poland is easy and there are not so many trains in Poland.\n\nSecond journey is from Stockholm to Finland by ferry. There are two ferry companies – Silja Line and Viking Line. Journey from Stockholm to Turku takes 11 hours and there is plenty small islands around. The daily ferry (Silja line) stops in Aaland isnand. The night line from Stockholm to Turku goes at 7pm and arrives at 7am (Finland has 1 hour more than Sweden). But the night line cost around Eur 60-75. The ferry to Helsinki leaves around 4pm, but it cost around Eur 80 and sneeking is difficult. Day line (Silja Line) leaves Stockholm at 7am and arrives to Turku at 7pm. Day line cost around Eur 10-17, usually Eur 15. Viking Line leaves at 7:45am from another place than Silja Line. Morning ferry (Viking line) cost Eur 10-20 through E-Shop, but Eur 25, if you buy it on the spot. You can try to buy ticket only to Aaland - Mariehamn island, and you can continue to Turku or even to Helsinki. Nobody checkinkg tickets on the ship or during getting of in Turku-Stockholm, they check it only during boarding. Sneeking on ferry is quite difficult by Silja Line. There are many security guys by the entrance gate and going by exit on the ship is almost impossible. It can be possible in moment, when passengers are getting out. Sneeking on Viking line is possible. There are many passengers boarding and you can try to sneek behind somebody. There are almost no security guys around. You can just play to pass the card to reader- your card is not working. In Viking line ferry - they are taking photos of boarding passengers more far behind gate. You can try to go one more floor upstairs, but there is too some photograph. But it is more easy to tell him that you don't want be on picture. It is possible to be hidden in someone's car. There are traveling some Hippie people with car too. Inside ship – you can put luggages into locked cage at begin of journey. There is Cafe In 6th floor in Silja line. Some guests leaves leftovers, but not so many. Only something during afternoon and nothing at Morning. There is buffet one floor more for breakfast and lunch. You can try to sneek there, when the workers does not watch. At Viking line - finding leftovers is almost impossible. There is Aurora buffet. They check everybody, who enter buffet, during morning. But they almost do not check entering passengers after lunch. You can just come into Aurora buffet and eat-dring. There is place for selling tickets to buffet (Eur 39), but they do not stop entering people in afternoon (after lunch).\n\nIf you go by ferry at morning, there is no good place, where to be until Morning in Stockholm. Ferry leaves around 7am resp 7:45am, so it is not possible to sleep out of the Stockholm, because you have not enough time to arrive to terminal. Ferry terminal close around 8pm and you can wait in Stockholm central train station, but it close around 0:30, bus terminal closes around midnight. There is McDonald shitty restaurant, sometimes they do not like waiting people during night and they sometimes kicks them out. Anyway, McDonald shitty restaurant closes at 5am (they had closing time at 2am at spring 2017, and you had to stay outside until 3:15 am, when bus terminal open). 3:15am - bus terminal opens again (it is close to central station, upstairs). Then subway in Stockholm (you need to sneek through gates behind somebody and security guys are around, but it is still easy to sneek) is open from 5am and close around 1 am. Terminal for ferry opens at 5am too - Silja Line. There is park with bench and noisy road close to ferry terminal and you can sleep there. But there are drunken and strange people during night – you can hide more between bushes.\n\nWhen the ferry comes to Turku (Abo) Hamm at evening, there are waiting two IC trains close to Ferry. One to Tampere and One to Helsinki. Second floor is pretty empty and you can hide there in toilet (PeterOB was sitting like during shitting without locked door almost all time). Conductors check tickets sometimes just one time after Turku (evening train is wuite empty, but somethimes, they checks after every station until Kirkonumi). First stop is just behind Tampere, they check usually after this stop. Trains after evening ferry arriving are last, if you will be kicked out, next train goes tomorrow. But if you already get to Kirkkonumi, there is commuter train to Helsinki without regular checking. Karjaa-Karis and Salo are stations without waiting room. If you go towards Tampere, Toitala station is already on main route Helsinki-Tampere with plenty of trains during day (but night is dubious).\n\nAnother ferry is between Umea (SE) and Vaasa (FI) and another ferry with longer journy is between Sundsvall (SE) and Vaasa (FI) There are lot of trains from Stockholm to Gavle, Hudiksvall, Sundsvall (SJ Snabbstaab and long journey SJ IC, Nattaget to north). Some SJ Snabbstaag trains continue to Umea too. Local trains (Norrtaag, X-Taget) has more stops. PetterOB does not know info about ferry between Vassa and Umea (pricing, sneeking, leftovers in restaurants and departure times).\n\nThird journey to Finland is around Baltic see, the Nordic Journey There are plenty trains from Stockholm to Gavle, Hudiksvall, Sundsvall, a lot of high-speed trains SJ Snabbstaag and long journey trains (SJ IC, SJ Nattaget, Arctic circle train). Some SJ Snabbstaag goes more north to Umea and there are SJ IC, SJ Orviga ,SJ Nattaget (night train) and local Norrtaag from Umea to Boden and Lulea. The trains from Sundsvall to Umea are not so often (local trains have more stops). From Umea to Boden goes Norrtaag local train and SJ IC (Arctic circle train) and night train SJ Nattaget. It is only one or two stops from Boden to Lulea (some trains with three stops ?).\n\nThere is road around Baltic sea from Lulea (SE) to Tornio (FI), Kemi (FI), Oulu (FI). It is motorway at least in some parts, like from border to Kemi and around-through Oulu. There is no train from Lulea (SE) to Finland, but only bus (you can try cash trick, but probability of success is not high). train line goes from important crossroad Boden (SE), to Tornio (border) and Kemi, but there are not trains for passengers. Maybe, some feright trains can go there. Tornio (do not exchange Tornio and Tervolta station, it is not the same town) is close to SE-FI border. First good train station is Kemi (Trains in Tornio (border) are pretty rare during Summer half-year and one train per day in one direction in Winter half-year - it is Ex between Helsinki-Tampere-Oulu-Kolari). It is one stop and 58 min between Kemi to Oulu by all IC or Ex trains. There is once a 3-4 hours train from Kemi to north-east (Rovaniemi) with only 3 stops, stops are (Oulu (Uleaborg) – Kemi – Tervola - Muurola – Rovaniemi). Night train IC 265 is with fewest stops and it goes even further (Oulu (Uleaborg) 4:50-4:57, Kemi 6:03-6:07, Rovaniemi 7:28-7:40, Misi 8:16-8:17, Kemijärvi 8:45), by idos.cz - only one train per day – IC265 goes from Rovaniemi to Misi and Kemijärvi. There is most north train line in Finland by border with Sweden to Kolari. But trains there are quite rare, if any. Another train line, which cross Arctic Circle, is from Kemi to Rovaniemi and Kemijärvi. Arctic circle is in north part of Rovaniemi. Once a 1-2 hours runs quite fast IC or Pendolino train between Helsinki – Tampere – Oulu. Some IC has two floors (easy to hide is second floor toilet) and some faster IC and Pendolinos has only one floor. Pendolinos are marked like green S2 at idos.cz and S at departure board.\n\nThe north journey by train and hitchhiking is nice in Summer with never-ending daylight. But there are a lot of Mosquitoes. The situation in winter is terrible. The Swedish train line Stockholm-Lulea is better, most of stations has waiting room, but waiting room is closed during night (no waiting room in some small stations with local trains). Many of stations in Finland are without waiting room. You can wait few hours for next train or longer during night (and next train can get echo from previous one). On the road from Sweden to Finland can be traffic low, almost no cars in some ramps. The winter temperature is here usually -5 to -20, sometimes bellow -30. Here – the death during exam in case that you fail is real treat in winter time.\n\nBlue-Black train (taking trains for free) is relative easy in Finland, it is super easy in region around Helsinki. There are a lot of commuter city trains around Helsinki. These trains goes every 10-30 minutes usually. Commuter city trains around Helsinki are marked as blue R-trains at idos.cz resp. jizdnirady.idnes.cz/vlaky/spojeni/, and they are marked many letters (K,P,R,D and many others) by "
