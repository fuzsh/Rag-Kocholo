13 THE DANNEBROG into Victory for tfie Danisfi crusaders under King Valdemar the Victorious in the Battle of Lmdanxs {Lyndaniz) against the pagan Esthonians The name Dannebrog probably de rives from the Frisian words dan (red) and iroge, which meant originally a coloured cloth, but was early applied to a muln coloured piece of fabric borne at the head of military detach- ments and the like The earliest men- tion of the name by Danish sources IS in the sixteenth century, but Swe- dish accounts dating from the fifteenth century speak of the Dannebrog as a military emblem m Denmark The earliest account of how the Danne brog floated down from the sky in 1219 dates from 1529 At about the same time it is stated that the earliest Dannebrog was captured by the Dit* marshers (of Holstein) m 1500, and after the victory over these in 1559 an old mutilated banner was conveyed to Slesvig Cathedral It may be taken for granted that Valdemar the Vic- torious departed from the current practice, whereby the ruling prince’s coat of arms served also as the stand ard of his army, and introduced the banner of the cross m the period after the expedition to Esthonia In the Tallinn emblem which he instituted there ts a white cross on a red field Probably the banner of the cross was a gife from the Pope for the exped. non against the eastern pagans The first certain evidence of the Danne brog is found on the royal seal of the Scandinavian Union of 1397, where the Danish lions are shown holding the cross flag A flag hung in the Maria Church at Lubeck, probably captured from the Danes in 1427« was the earliest surviving Dannebrog, it is believed to have been destroyed in an air raid during the Second World War Through the years down to the seventeenth century the belief was held that the original banner, fallen from the sky, was m the custody of the lung In a naval engagement against the Hanseatc League in the Sound in 1427, the Danes wan a great victory, 6ut (he men of

golden lion in the top inside corner In 1815 It was superseded by the Swedish flag with the Norwegian national emblem, which was retained until the present Norwegian flag was composed The National

the DaneUw (Danehgtn), where they settled m the course of the ninth century and introduced Da nish minnen and customs, belong to pre heraldic times and so are not tc- presented in the coat of arms, but by uudying its sanous symbols it is pos sible to trace Denmark’s later interna tional engagements ■ The shield with the three lions denies from the family device of the Valdeman, whose three lions passant, crowned or uncrowned, or leopards (lions passant guardant) are first met with m 1190 in the indistinct seal of Knud (Canute) IV, the position of the heads being here uncertain The lion tjpe was officially fixed under Frcdc* rik V/ (l/'6S~tSJ9) The lions were originally m a scutcheon strewn irre- gularly with heart shaped ‘water lily* leaves, at a late period the number of these figures, long regarded by that time as hearts, was fixed at nine and regularly placed The wyvern, symboliamg the vie tory of the warrior Bishop Absalon over the pagan ITends m the island of Rugen m 1H9, corresponds to the title of ‘King of the Wends', this sym bol was, however, first adopted in 1440 by Christopher III After the conquest of Gothland from the Han- scauc League m 1361, Valdcmar IV took the title of 'King of the Goths’, and the emblem for this, a lion pas- sant over nine hearts was borne for the fint time m 1449 by Christian I In 1448, the house of Oldenborg succeeded to the throne in the person of Christian I (since when the Danish kings have been called alternately Oiristian and rrederik, with one ex ception, Hans, whose reign in 1481- 1513 has made the Christians always two numbers ahead of the Frederiks) The Oldcnborgs introduced the cen- 16 daswaik tral incjcutchcofi, the two red bars representing Oldenborg, the cross the Oldenborg province of Delmcnhorst.

It is dif ficult to state the precise size of metropolitan Denmark, as the area is subject to constant variation owing to marine erosion and deposit and to re clamation work Moreover, where tides are active the coastline shifts twice daily Thus on the west coast of South Jutland it changes locally with ebb and flow by up to 10 kilometres (6 miles) The extent of the land is measured by the margin of constant land vegetation Included in the land area are lakes and streams but not inlets (horde) directly connected with the sea among them the lagoon of Ringkobing (Ringkobmg Fjord) which IS linked with the North Sea by the sluices at Hvide Sande Subject to these qualifications the size of Den mark i$ as follows Jutland peninsula 23 792 sq kilometres ( 9 585 sq miles) 100 inhabited islands 19093

Denmark may be described as an archipelago m the fullest sense Where as the land frontier with Germa ny is only 67 7 km (42 miles) the coastline is over 7 400 km (4 600 miles) Thus the Danish area is one of the most dissected land masses in Europe and its coastline is ten tunes as long as the shortest possible coast 1 ne of an island having the same area This fact has undoubtedly helped m many ways to mould Denmark $ destiny and has conditioned an mten sive development of occupations asso ciated with the sea It IS characteristic that periods of great political power in Danish history have been based on strong naval power, as in the Viking petiod and the medieval expansion in the Baltic area and periods of great commercial power can be seen as results of the same factors as they have been based on the effic ency of merchant ship ping Th s IS true of a mercantile ex pans on in the sixteenth century which led to the establishment of colonies m Ind a on the Gu nca coast and m the West Indies and it is true of a flour ishing period of overseas trade in die seventeenth century with adventurous voyages to China The same rule may be said to have carried forward to the large fishing shipbuilding and ship ping activities of today B Position and its Consequences The northernmost point of Denmark The Skaw (Skagens Odde) is situated at 57® 45 N lat the southernmost pome Gedser Odde, at 54® 34 N lat The situation in the northern hemi sphere which is inhabited by over tune tenths of the population of the world and where an even larger share of the productive forces are centred has played a part in Denmark s cul turat and economic development Furthermore the position on the' North Sea has brought advantages through proximity to some of the most densely populated industrial states of Western Europe Other con sequences of the country $ position can be more precisely expressed the length of day ranges over the year between seven and 17*/* hours a factor wh eh governs inter aha the range of cul tivated plants that can be grown The degree of latitude also determines that the sun at noon m midsummer stands at 57’/*“ degrees above the horizon m midwinter at

North Atlantic be tween populous regions of the United States and Western Europe, as well as the corresponding arc across the North Pole to Japan and the great population centres of East Asia ■ Climatic Features Denmark lies on the western fringe of the Eurasian continental block, fronting an ocean which, because it is traversed by water masses from southern latitudes (Gulf Stream), brings

tern perature in the coldest month is 12 degrees higher than the average for 56* N lat At the same time, the water of the Baltic, separating Denmark from the continental land masses, usually ensures that it is not subject to the continental cbmate of Eastern Europe Exceptionally, when in winter the ice closes the Baltic and prevents Its waters from acting as a reserve of heat, cold air streams from the east can spread over Denmark and cause hard winters During one such winter in 1940, the air temperature was the lowest, minus 31® C (-23 8 F), ever recorded in Denmark Conversely, 100^ 3 3 3

four and a half months of the year the mean temperature exceeds 10* C (6S* T), the natural type of vegetation is de* ciduous forest, but at it borders on the coniferous belt, spruce and fir thrive in plantations Natural dc ciduous forest, containing beech, oak, dm, and lime, survive in only a few localities About 10 per cent of the land area is forest, but this, virtually everywhere, has been planted and is cultivated Natural plant communities include dune vegetation and heathland plants, which chiefly occur on the sandy heaths of West Jutland Traces of former cultivation reveal that heath- land plants were not the original vegetation Heather vegetation is also found on steep hill slopes, on the granite terrain of Bornholm, and on gravelly beach ridges Bogs occur in two principal

The Danes strove persistently to do- minate the union and Sweden’s mem- bership ssas of short duration During internal conflicts the union disinte- grated in the course of the fifteenth century and in 1523 it broke down altogether in the face of an inercas- ingly powerful Sweden. DENMARK 73 HISTORY The Struggle for the Baltic (c 1500-1660) ■ Rivalry between the two leading Scandinavian Powers dominated high policy for the next two centuries At the same time the Danish kings especially Hans (1481-1513) and Christian II (1513-23), endeavoured to consolidate the monarchy by means of a more despotic policy towards the aristocratic landowners, aided by the cownspeople especially m Copenha gen the capital These attempts ted to a bitter civil war, markedly political and social m character The revolt to begin with was a failure Three fourths of the land was owned by the lords temporal and spiritual, and m the political struggles and economic troubles of the preceding centuries they had secured control over nearly four fifths of the peasants The nobles had strengthened their position further through the development of a closed aristocratic group of about 250 fami lies, who monopolixed the land as will as national offices and authority The nobility, on the whole emerged victorious from the struggle The real loser, besides burghers and peasants, was the Church The Lutheran move ment had penetrated to Denmark from Germany through southern Jut land and it soon gained the monar chy’s support When the civil war was over and monarchy and temporal nobility restored the Reformation was earned through The State took over Church lands and the king became supreme head of the new Church with the bishops as his officials From the middle of the sixteenth century Denmark experienced a period of economic prosperity The landed nobility with their large cattle exports and the monarchy with its Sound Dues, levied on the rich trade passing through the Sound, recovered their former strength The Renaissance came in its handsome Netherlands style In this flourishing period Chri stian IV (1588-1648) strove hard for a more modern system of trade in a spine of national mercantilism, and endeavoured to strengthen the fighting services for the final struggle for the Baltic and the great international struggles that were to come B In spite of every effort it was too late There were great internal differ enccs between king and nobles and many mistakes were committed on both sides, m particular Denmark, for all her former leadership in Scandinavia, had gradually exhausted herself in the ceaseless struggle and had been fundamentally incapable of renewing her political or military or gamzauon since the Middle Ages The During a peasants revolt n 1S34 tHe manor of Spott up in Sail ng North Jutland was burnt down and the present build ngs were built soon afterwards In sp te of the development of cannon the castle served Its pu pose as a stronghold In a d sir ct where there was more I kef hood of a peasant r s ng than a ege by a regular army Spotirup was a so catted bullock farm concent ating on the breed ng of bullocks for export 74 DANMARK An eternal blot cn the heneur of Christ »n II Is the Stockholm blood bath of 1530 when In spite of a wr ttert pledge ef amnesty after hts preolamal on as hered tsry king of Sweden he caused nearly 80 ef Ms opponents nctuding two b shops to be beheaded Qustarus Vasa who was ch etly responsible lor the break away ef Sweden from Dan sh domlnanee had this print made of the crime as propaganda against Christian ttan6mi6c|atmfl?El/roti(fc= Tfct/ van t>cm RSningt tfeo ZDennes tnarcf/vn^bnt ^mn van £flb(cf /^tgm &m Qw(bw/B<f4j«n/ btn 30. vn 31. itlAq/ 2(nn». 1^64.
