Their stubbornness can lead them to stick to their beliefs and decisions even when presented with evidence to the contrary. However, this unwavering determination can also be a source of strength, helping them to persevere through obstacles and achieve their goals.\n\nTheir possessiveness can manifest in various aspects of their lives, whether it's material possessions, relationships, or ideas. They may have a strong attachment to their belongings and find it difficult to let go of things, even when it's no longer practical or beneficial. In relationships, they may display a desire for control and exclusivity, which can lead to jealousy and conflict if not managed healthily.\n\n2.

They are drawn to people and activities that ignite their passion and creativity. On the other hand, uneasy nervousness and anxious people tend to irritate them, as they disrupt their sense of stability and control.\n\n5.
