This is an increase of nearly 3000 stations from the 2001 ASHRAE Handbook—Funda- mentals. The large number of stations, along with the addition of several new table elements, made printing the tables impracticable. Consequently, only the design conditions for Atlanta, GA, appear in this printed chapter to illustrate the table format. An appendix to this chapter lists all 4422 stations, the complete data tables for which are contained on the CD-ROM. This climatic design information is commonly used for design, sizing, distribution, installation, and marketing of heating, ventilat- ing, air-conditioning, and dehumidification equipment, as well as for other energy-related processes in residential, agricultural, com- mercial, and industrial applications. These summaries include val- ues of dry-bulb, wet-bulb, and dew-point temperature, and wind speed with direction at various frequencies of occurrence. Sources of other climate information of potential interest to ASHRAE mem- bers are described later in this chapter. Design information in this chapter was developed largely through research project RP-1273 (ASHRAE 2004a). The informa- tion includes design values of dry-bulb with mean coincident wet- bulb temperature, design wet-bulb with mean coincident dry-bulb temperature, and design dew-point with mean coincident dry-bulb temperature and corresponding humidity ratio. These data allow the designer to consider various operational peak conditions. Design values of wind speed allow for the design of smoke management systems in buildings (ASHRAE 1994; Lamming and Salmon 1998). Warm-season temperature and humidity conditions are based on annual percentiles of 0.4, 1.0, and 2.0. Cold-season conditions are based on annual percentiles of 99.6 and 99.0. The use of annual per- centiles to define design conditions ensures that they represent the same probability of occurrence in any climate, regardless of the sea- sonal distribution of extreme temperature and humidity. New elements included in this edition are cold-season dew-point temperature with coincident humidity ratio and dry-bulb tempera- ture; warm-season enthalpy with coincident dry-bulb temperature; extreme maximum wet-bulb temperature; 5-, 10-, 20- and 50-year return period for maximum and minimum extreme dry-bulb temper- ature; hottest/coldest month; UTC (Universal Time Coordinated) offset; time zone code; and monthly mean daily dry-bulb tempera- ture range. Also, the monthly tables of 0.4, 1.0, and 2.0% dry-bulb temperature with mean coincident wet-bulb temperature, and wet- bulb temperature with mean coincident dry-bulb temperature, which were included in the 2001 volume only for U.S. stations, are now included for all stations. Additionally, the Outdoor Air Temperature section that was previ- ously contained in Chapter 30 has been consolidated into this chapter under the section on Generating Design-Day Data. This section includes procedures for generating 24 h weather data sequences which are suitable as input to many HVAC analysis methods. The preparation of this chapter is assigned to TC 4.2, Weather Information. 28 long-term hourly observations were available (1972-2001 for most U.S. and Canadian stations, and 1982-2001 for the rest of the world). Compared to the 2001 chapter, the number of U.S. stations increased from 510 to 753 (48% increase); the number of Canadian stations increased from 133 to 307 (131% increase); and the number of other international stations increased from 821 to 3362 (310%). Data from 6 stations published in the 2001 chapter, have been elim- inated from this edition because of data quality problems; values from the 2001 chapter may be used for these stations.

Mean and standard deviation of extreme annual maximum and minimum dry-bulb temperature, °C. 17. 5-, 10-, 20-, and 50-year return period values for maximum and minimum extreme dry-bulb temperature, °C. Monthly Design Conditions Monthly percentiles of dry-bulb and wet-bulb temperature, and monthly mean daily dry-bulb temperature range are provided in col- umns 18-20 of Table 1 for Atlanta, GA. Monthly design conditions are included on the CD-ROM for all 4422 stations. These values are derived from the same analysis that results in the annual design con- ditions. The monthly summaries are useful when seasonal varia- or building use patterns require consideration. In particular, these values can be used when determining air-conditioning loads during periods of maximum solar radiation. The monthly information in Table 1 is identified by the following column numbers: 18. Dry-bulb temperature corresponding to 0.4, 1.0, and 2.0% cumulative frequency of occurrence for indicated month, °C; mean coincident wet-bulb temperature, °C. 19. Wet-bulb temperature corresponding to 0.4, 1.0, and 2.0% cumulative frequency of occurrence for indicated month, °C; mean coincident dry-bulb temperature, °C. 20. Mean daily temperature range for month indicated, °C (defined as mean of difference between daily maximum/minimum dry- bulb temperatures). For a 30-day month, the 0.4, 1.0, and 2.0% values of occurrence represent the value that occurs or is exceeded for a total of 3, 7, or 14 h, respectively, per month on average over the period of record. Monthly percentile values of dry- or wet-bulb temperature may be higher or lower than the design conditions corresponding to the same nominal percentile, depending on the month and the seasonal distribution of the parameter at that location. Generally, for the hot- test or most humid months of the year, the monthly percentile value exceeds the design condition for the same element corresponding to the same nominal percentile. For example, in Table 1, column 9a shows that the annual 0.4% design dry-bulb temperature at Atlanta, GA, is 34.4°C. Column 18 shows that the 0.4% monthly dry-bulb temperature exceeds 34.4°C for June, July, and August, with values of 34.8, 36.8, and 35.8°C, respectively. Data Sources The following three primary sources of observational data sets were used for the calculation of design values: 1. Hourly weather observations from Surface Airways Meteorolog- ical and Solar Observing Network (SAMSON) data from the 28.4 2005 ASHRAE Handbook—Fundamentals (SI) National Climatic Data Center (NCDC) for 239 U.S. observing locations from 1961 to 1990 (NCDC 1991). 2. Hourly weather records for the period 1972 to 2001 for 145 Canadian locations from the Canadian Weather Energy and Engineering Data Sets (CWEEDS) produced by Environment Canada (Environment Canada 2002). 3. Integrated Surface Hourly (ISH) data for stations from around the world provided by NCDC for the period 1982 to 2001 (Lott et al. 2001; NCDC 2003). Two primary periods of record were used in the calculations. The values for most United States and Canadian locations are based on the period from 1972 through 2001. SAMSON data, and in some cases CWEEDS data, were supplemented by ISH data in order to derive design conditions from the longest possible period of record. Values for international locations and a small number of the U.S. and Canadian stations whose data were analyzed from the ISH files, are based on the period 1982 through 2001. The actual number of years used in the calculations for a given station is dependent on the amount of missing data, and, as discussed in the next section, may be as little as 8 years. Additionally, in order to publish as many stations as possible from the 2001 ASHRAE Handbook—Funda- mentals, there are 6 stations whose calculations are based on the 1961-1990 period. Column 1i in Table 1 lists the first and last years of record used to calculate design conditions. Calculation of Design Conditions Values of ambient dry-bulb, dew-point, and wet-bulb tempera- ture and wind speed corresponding to the various annual percentiles represent the value that is exceeded on average by the indicated per- centage of the total number of hours in a year (8760). The 0.4, 1.0, 2.0, and 5.0% values are exceeded on average 35, 88, 175, and 438 h per year, respectively, for the period of record. The design values occur more frequently than the corresponding nominal percentile in some years and less frequently in others. The 99.0% and 99.6% (cold-season) values are defined in the same way but are usually viewed as the values for which the corresponding weather element is less than the design condition for 88 and 35 h, respectively. Simple design conditions were obtained by binning hourly data into frequency vectors, then deriving from the binned data the design condition having the probability of being exceeded a certain percentage of the time. Mean coincident values were obtained by double-binning the hourly data into joint frequency matrices, then calculating the mean coincident value corresponding to the simple design condition. The weather data sets used for the calculations often contain missing values—either isolated records, or because some stations report data only every third hour. Gaps up to 6 h were filled by linear interpolation to provide as complete a time series as possible. Dry- bulb temperature, dew-point temperature, station pressure and humidity ratio were interpolated. However, wind speed and direc- tion were not interpolated because of their more stochastic and unpredictable nature. Some stations in the ISH data set also provide data that were not recorded at the beginning of the hour. When data at the exact hour was missing, it was replaced by data up to 0.5 h before or after, when available. Finally, psychrometric quantities such as wet-bulb temperature or enthalpy are not contained in the weather data sets. They were calculated from dry-bulb temperature, dew-point temperature, and station pressure using the psychrometric equations in Chapter 6 of the 2001 ASHRAE Handbook—Fundamentals. Measures were taken to ensure that the number and distribution of missing data, both by month and by hour of the day, did not intro- duce significant biases into the analysis. Annual cumulative fre- quency distributions were constructed from the relative frequency distributions compiled for each month. Each individual month’s data were included if they met the following screening criteria for completeness and unbiased distribution of missing data after data filling: • The number of hourly dry-bulb temperature values for the month, after filling by interpolation, had to be at least 85% of the total hours for the month. • The difference between the number of day and nighttime dry-bulb temperature observations had to be less than 60. Although the minimum period of record selected for this analysis was 20 years (1982 through 2001 for most stations), some variation and gaps in observed data meant that some months’ data were unus- able because of incompleteness. Some months were also eliminated during additional quality control checks. A station’s dry-bulb tem- perature design conditions were calculated only if there were data from at least 8 months that met the quality control and screening cri- teria from the period of record for each month of the year. For exam- ple, there had to be 8 months each of January, February, March, etc. for which data met the completeness screening criteria. These crite- ria were ascertained from results of RP-1171 (ASHRAE 2004b) and were the same as used in calculating the design conditions in the 2001 ASHRAE Handbook—Fundamentals. Dew-point temperature, wet-bulb temperature, and enthalpy design conditions were calculated for a given month only if the number of dew-point, wet-bulb, or enthalpy values was greater than 85% of the number of dry-bulb temperature values; wind speed and direction conditions were calculated for a given month only if the number of values was greater than 28.3% (i.e., one third of 85%) the number of dry-bulb temperature values. For example, a month of January was included in calculations if the number of dry-bulb temperature values exceeded 85% of 744 h, or 633 h. If there were 712 h with dry-bulb temperature, the month was included in calcu- lation of dew-point temperature design conditions only if dew-point temperature was present for at least 85% of 712 h, or 606 h. The month was included in calculation of wind speed design conditions only if wind speed was present for at least 28.3% of 712 h, or 202 h. Annual dry-bulb temperature extremes were calculated only for years that were 85% complete. At least 8 annual extremes were required to calculate the mean and standard deviation of extreme annual dry-bulb temperatures. Daily minimum and maximum temperatures were calculated only for complete days. A final quality check was made of the calculated design values to identify potential errors. These checks included contour plots, con- sistency checks among the various parameters, and comparison to the 2001 chapter’s values; these checks eliminated 6 stations that had been published in the 2001 edition. Further details of the anal- ysis procedures are available in ASHRAE (2004a). Differences With Previously Published Design Conditions Methodologies used to derive the design conditions were, for the most part, the same as those used for computing previously pub- lished values (ASHRAE 1997c, Colliver et al. 2000). Some very small differences may result from the use of a longer period of record (20 years versus 12 years for most international stations) and the different period of record for most U.S. and Canadian stations (1972-2001 versus 1961-1993). A few subtle differences in the tables’ contents must be noted: • Missing values. Calculation methods used for this chapter’s data required completeness criteria for dew-point temperature, wind speed and direction time series, as well as for the calculation of yearly and daily statistics. For approximately 35% of stations, these criteria were not met and the corresponding design condi- tions appear as N/A in the tables. Methodology used for the 2001 chapter only checked for completeness of the dry-bulb temper- Climatic Design Information 28.5 ature and, for other elements, may have resulted in some values that are not statistically representative. • 99.6 and 99% heating dry-bulb temperatures. Values for the 99.6 and 99% dry-bulb temperatures in this chapter may be sig- nificantly lower than those in the 2001 edition for about 20 sta- tions, located mostly in cold climates, particularly in Canada. This is due to an algorithmic change, explained in ASHRAE (2004a), in which previous heating dry-bulb design conditions were calculated from the dry-bulb/dew-point joint frequency matrix. If dew-point temperature was missing, dry-bulb tempera- ture was not used. In cold climates, dew-point temperature may not be reported at very cold temperatures (<–36°C). For this chap- ter, the dry-bulb design conditions were calculated from the dry- bulb frequency vector, thus eliminating this problem. • Standard deviation of extreme annual dry-bulb temperature. Because of the introduction of completeness requirements for cal- culation of yearly statistics (see the section on Calculation of Design Conditions), and improved quality control of the data used, some of these values (approximately 30%) in this chapter are at least 0.5°C different from those published in the 2001 edi- tion. Further details concerning differences between design condi- tions in this chapter and the 2001 edition are described in ASHRAE (2004a). Differences with the 1993 and previous editions are de- scribed in ASHRAE (1997c) and Colliver et al. (2000). Applicability and Characteristics of Design Conditions Climatic design values in this chapter represent different psy- chrometric conditions. Design data based on dry-bulb temperature represent peak occurrences of the sensible component of ambient outdoor conditions. Design values based on wet-bulb temperature are related to the enthalpy of the outdoor air. Conditions based on dew point relate to the peaks of the humidity ratio. The designer, engineer, or other user must decide which set(s) of conditions and probability of occurrence apply to the design situation under con- sideration. Additional sources of information on frequency and duration of extremes of temperature and humidity are provided in the section on Other Sources of Climatic Information. Further infor- mation is available from Harriman et al. (1999). Heating and Humidification Design Conditions. Column 2 of Table 1 shows the month with the lowest mean dry-bulb tempera- ture. This is used, for example, as input to the ASHRAE clear sky model for generating solar data consistent with annual heating design conditions in Column 3. The 99.6 and 99.0% design conditions in Column 3 of Table 1 are often used in sizing heating equipment. Column 4 provides information for cold-season humidification applications. Columns 5 and 6 of Table 1 provide information for estimating peak loads accounting for infiltration. Column 5 provides extreme wind speeds for the coldest month, with the mean coincident dry- bulb temperature. Column 6 provides the mean wind speed and direction coincident to the 99.6% design dry-bulb temperature in column 3a. Cooling and Dehumidification Design Conditions. Column 7 of Table 1 shows the month with the highest mean dry-bulb temper- ature and is used as input to the ASHRAE clear sky model for gen- erating solar data consistent with annual cooling design conditions (Column 9). Column 8 contains the mean daily dry-bulb temperature range for the hottest month. This value is the mean difference between the daily maximum and minimum temperatures during the hottest month (Column 7) and is calculated from the extremes of the hourly temperature observations. The true maximum and minimum tem- peratures for any day generally occur between hourly readings. Thus, the mean maximum and minimum temperatures calculated in this way are about 0.5°C less extreme than the mean daily extreme temperatures observed with maximum and minimum thermome- ters. This results in the true daily temperature range generally being about 1°C greater than those calculated from hourly data. The 0.4, 1.0, and 2.0% dry-bulb temperatures and mean coinci- dent wet-bulb temperatures in Column 9 of Table 1 often represent conditions on hot, mostly sunny days. These are often used in sizing cooling equipment such as chillers or air-conditioning units. Design conditions based on wet-bulb temperature in Column 10 represent extremes of the total sensible plus latent heat of outdoor air. This information is useful for cooling towers, evaporative cool- ers, and fresh air ventilation system design. Column 11 provides the mean wind speed and direction coinci- dent to the 0.4% design dry-bulb temperature in column 9a and is used for estimating peak loads accounting for infiltration. Design conditions based on dew-point temperatures in Column 12 of Table 1 are directly related to extremes of humidity ratio, which represent peak moisture loads from the weather. Extreme dew-point conditions may occur on days with moderate dry-bulb temperatures, resulting in high relative humidity. These values are especially useful for humidity control applications, such as desic- cant cooling and dehumidification, cooling-based dehumidifica- tion, and fresh-air ventilation systems. The values are also used as a check point when analyzing the behavior of cooling systems at part-load conditions, particularly when such systems are used for humidity control as a secondary function. Humidity ratio values in Column 12 are calculated from the corresponding dew-point tem- perature and the standard pressure at the location’s elevation. Annual Enthalpy Design Conditions. Column 13 of Table 1 gives the annual enthalpy for the cooling season; this is used for cal- culating cooling loads caused by infiltration and/or ventilation into buildings. Enthalpy represents the total heat content of air (the sum of its sensible and latent energies). Cooling loads can be easily cal- culated knowing the conditions of both the outdoor ambient and the building’s interior air. Extreme Annual Design Conditions. Extreme annual design wind speeds in Column 14 of Table 1 are used in designing smoke management systems. The extreme maximum wet-bulb temperature in Column 15 pro- vides the highest wet-bulb temperature observed over the entire period of record and is the most extreme condition expected for evaporative processes such as cooling towers. For most locations, the extreme maximum wet-bulb value is significantly higher than the 0.4% wet-bulb (Column 10a) and should be used only for design of critical applications where an occasional short-duration capacity shortfall is not acceptable. Column 16 provides the mean and standard deviation of the extreme annual maximum and minimum dry-bulb temperatures. The probability of occurrence of very extreme conditions can be required for design of equipment to ensure continuous operation and serviceability regardless of whether the heating or cooling loads are being met. These values were calculated from extremes of hourly temperature observations. The true maximum and min- imum temperatures for any day generally occur between hourly readings. Thus, the mean maximum and minimum temperatures calculated in this way are about 0.5°C less extreme than the mean daily extreme temperatures observed with maximum and mini- mum thermometers. Return Period of Extreme Temperatures: The 5-, 10-, 20- and 50-year return periods for maximum and minimum extreme dry- bulb temperature are shown in column 17 of Table 1. Return period (or recurrence interval) is defined as the reciprocal of the annual probability of occurrence. For instance, the 50-year return period maximum dry-bulb temperature has a probability of occurring or being exceeded of 2.0% (i.e., 1/50) each year. This statistic does not indicate how often the condition will occur in terms of the number of hours each year (as in the design conditions based on percentiles) 28.6 2005 ASHRAE Handbook—Fundamentals (SI) but describes the probability of the condition occurring at all in any year. The following method can be used to estimate the return period (recurrence interval) of extreme temperatures: Tn = M + IFs (1) where Tn = n-year return period value of extreme dry-bulb temperature to be estimated, years M = mean of annual extreme maximum or minimum dry-bulb temperatures, °C s = standard deviation of annual extreme maximum or minimum dry-bulb temperatures, °C I = 1 if maximum dry-bulb temperatures are being considered = –1 if minimum dry-bulb temperatures are being considered F = For example, the 50-year return period extreme maximum dry-bulb temperature estimated for Atlanta, GA, is 41°C (M = 35.8°C (column 16a), s = 2.0 (column 16c), n = 50, I = 1). Similarly, the 50- year return period extreme minimum dry-bulb temperature for Atlanta, GA, is –21.9°C [M = –11.8°C (column 16b), s = 3.9 (col- umn 16d), n = 50, I = –1]. The n-year return periods can be obtained for most stations using the Weather Data Viewer, version 3.0 (ASHRAE 2005), which is discussed in the section on Other Sources of Climatic Information. Calculation of the n-year return period is based on assumptions that annual maxima and minima are distributed according to the Gumbel (Type 1 Extreme Value) distribution and are fitted with the method of moments (Lowery and Nash 1970). The uncertainty or standard error using this method increases with standard deviation, value of return period, and decreasing length of the period of record. It can be significant. For instance, the standard error in the 50-year return period maximum dry-bulb temperature estimated at a loca- tion with a 12-year period of record can be 3°C or more. Thus, the uncertainty of return period values estimated in this way are greater for international and other locations with a period of record from 1982-2001 than for those U.S. and Canadian stations with the longer period of record from 1972-2001. GENERATING DESIGN-DAY DATA This section provides procedures for generating 24 h weather data sequences suitable as input to many HVAC analysis methods, including the Radiant Time Series cooling load procedure described in Chapter 30. Dry-Bulb Temperature. Table 2 gives a representative daily temperature profile in fractions of daily temperature range. To cal- culate hourly temperatures, subtract the fraction of the daily range indicated for each hour from the design dry-bulb temperature. This procedure is applicable to annual or monthly data and is illustrated in the example to follow. Note that the daily range values in Table 1 are the differences between the average daily maximum and average daily minimum for the warmest month (Column 8) and the 12 months of the year (Column 20). More representative design-day temperature profiles might be obtained by determining or estimating conditions for typ- ical hot days at the building site. Dew-Point Temperature and Other Moist-Air Properties. Dew-point temperature is assumed approximately constant over the design day, and limited by saturation. The design dew-point temper- ature is calculated from the design dry-bulb and mean coincident wet-bulb temperatures using the psychrometric chart or equations in Chapter 6, or using psychrometric software. The dew-point temper- ature for each hour is the smaller of the design dew-point tempera- ture and the dry-bulb temperature for that hour. Other moist air properties (e.g., wet-bulb temperature, humidity ratio, and enthalpy) can then be derived using psychrometric procedures. 6 π -------- 0.5772 n n 1– ------------ ⎝ ⎠ ⎛ ⎞lnln– ⎩ ⎭ ⎨ ⎬ ⎧ ⎫ – Thus, tdp,des = DP(tdb,des, twb,des) (2) tdb,h = tdb,des – fh DR (3) tdp,h = min (tdp,des, twb,h) (4) where tdp,des = design dew-point temperature, °C DP = dew-point calculation function tdb,des = design dry-bulb temperature (annual or monthly DB value from Table 1), °C twb,des = design mean coincident wet-bulb temperature (annual or monthly MCWB value from Table 1), °C tdb,h = hourly dry-bulb temperature, °C fh = hourly daily range fraction (from Table 2) DR = daily range of dry-bulb temperature (monthly or annual DR value from Table 1), °C tdp,h = hourly dew-point temperature, °C Example: Deriving Hourly Design-Day Temperatures. Calculate hourly design values for Atlanta, GA, for July using the 2% design conditions. Solution: From Table 1, the July 2% design conditions for Atlanta are 34.9°C for dry-bulb (column 18m), 24.0°C for mean coincident wet- bulb (column 18n), and 9.7°C for the daily range (column 20g). Using Equation (2) and the psychrometric chart (see Chapter 6), tdp,des = 19.6°C. Applying Equations (3) and (4) for hour 1 yields tdb,1 = 34.9 – 0.87 × 9.7 = 26.5°C and tdp,1 = 19.6°C. Referring again to the psychro- metric chart, twb,1 = 21.7°C. Table 3 shows the results after repeating this procedure for all 24 h. Incident Solar Radiation. For many buildings, the primary determinant of cooling load is solar gains from fenestration and as absorbed by opaque surfaces. The ASHRAE clear sky model described in Chapter 31 can be used to estimate hourly clear-day solar radiation for any month of the year in U.S. or similar temperate climates in the northern hemisphere.

Climatic Design Information 28.7 published a variant of the ASHRAE clear sky model; applicable for any climate in the world, it uses visibility as input rather than monthly coefficients that are only appropriate for mid-latitude loca- tions. REPRESENTATIVENESS OF DATA AND SOURCES OF UNCERTAINTY Representativeness of Data The climatic design information in this chapter was obtained by direct analysis of observations from the indicated locations. Design values are provided and used as an estimate of the annual cumula- tive frequency of occurrence of the weather conditions at the record- ing station for several years into the future. Several sources of uncertainty affect the accuracy of using the design conditions to rep- resent other locations or periods. The most important of these factors is spatial representativeness. Most of the observed data for which design conditions were calcu- lated were collected from airport observing sites, the majority of which are flat, grassy, open areas, away from buildings and trees or other local influences. Temperatures recorded in these areas may be significantly different (3 to 5°C lower) compared to areas where the design conditions are being applied. Significant variations can also occur with changes in local elevation, across large metropolitan areas, or in the vicinity of large bodies of water. Judgment must always be exercised in assessing the representativeness of the design conditions. It is especially important to note the elevation of loca- tions, because design conditions vary significantly for locations whose elevations differ by as little as a few hundred metres. Data representing the psychrometric conditions are generally properties of air masses rather than local features, and tend to vary on regional scales. As a result, a particular value may reasonably represent an area extending several miles. Consult an applied climatologist regarding estimating design conditions for locations not listed in this chapter. The underlying data also depend on the method of observation. During the 1990s, most data gathering in the U.S. and Canada was converted to automated systems designated either an ASOS (Auto- mated Surface Observation System) or an AWOS (Automated Weather Observing System). This change has improved complete- ness and consistency of available data. However, changes have resulted from the inherent differences in type of instrumentation, instrumentation location, and processing procedures between the prior manual systems and ASOS. These effects were investigated in ASHRAE research project RP-1226 (ASHRAE 2004c). Compari- son of one-year ASOS and manual records revealed some biases in dry-bulb temperature, dew-point temperature, and wind speed. These biases are judged to be negligible for HVAC engineering pur- poses; the tabulated design conditions in this chapter were derived from mixed automated and manual data as available. It has been rec- ognized that changes in the location of the observing instruments often have a larger effect than the change in instrumentation. On the other hand, ASOS measurements of sky coverage and ceiling height differ markedly from manual observations and are incompatible with solar radiation models used in energy simulation software. An updated solar model, compatible with ASOS data, was developed as part of RP-1226. The ASOS-based model was found less accurate than models based on manual data when compared to measured solar radiation. Weather conditions vary from year to year and, to some extent, from decade to decade because of the inherent variability of climate. Similarly, values representing design conditions vary depending on the period of record used in the analysis. Thus, because of short-term climatic variability, there is always some uncertainty in using design conditions from one period to represent another period. Typically, values of design dry-bulb temperature vary less than 1°C from decade to decade, but larger variations can occur. Differing periods used in the analysis can lead to differences in design conditions between nearby locations at similar elevations. Design conditions may show trends in areas of increasing urbanization or other regions experiencing extensive changes to land use. Longer-term climatic change brought by human or natural causes may also introduce trends into design conditions, but no conclusive evidence or consen- sus of opinion is available on the rapidity or nature of such changes. Wind speed and direction are very sensitive to local exposure fea- tures such as terrain and surface cover. The original wind data used to calculate the wind speed and direction design conditions in Table 1 are often representative of a flat, open exposure, such as at airports. Wind engineering methods, as described in Chapter 16, can be used to account for exposure differences between airport and building sites. This is a complex procedure, best undertaken by an experienced applied climatologist or wind engineer with knowledge of the expo- sure of the observing and building sites and surrounding regions. Uncertainty from Variation in Length of Record ASHRAE Research Project RP-1171 (ASHRAE 2004b) investi- gated the uncertainty associated with the climatic design conditions in the ASHRAE Handbook—Fundamentals. The main objectives were to determine how many years are needed to calculate reliable design values and to look at the frequency and duration of episodes exceeding the design values. Design temperatures in the 1997 and 2001 editions were calcu- lated for locations for which there were at least 8 years of sufficient data; the criterion for using 8 years was based on unpublished work by TC 4.2. RP-1171 analyzed data records from 14 U.S. locations (see Table 4) representing four different climate types. The dry-bulb temperatures corresponding to the five annual percentile design temperatures (99.6, 99, 0.4, 1, and 2%) from the 33-year period 1961-1993 (period used for the 2001 edition’s U.S. stations) were calculated for each location. The temperatures corresponding to the same percentiles for each contiguous subperiod ranging from 1 to 33 years in length was calculated and the standard deviation of the differences between the resulting design temperature from each subperiod and the entire 33-year period was calculated. For instance, for a 10-year period, the dry-bulb values corresponding to each of the 23 subperiods 1961-1970, 1962-1971, . . . , 1984-1993 were calculated and the standard deviation of differences with the dry-bulb value for the same percentile from the 33-year period cal- culated. The standard deviation values represent a measure of uncertainty of the design temperatures relative to the design temper- ature for the entire period of record. The results for the five annual percentiles are summarized in Fig- ures 2A to E, each of which shows how the uncertainty (the average standard deviation for each of the locations in each climate type) varies with length of period. To the degree that the differences used to calculate the standard deviations are distributed normally, the short-period design temper- atures can be expected to lie within one standard deviation of the long-term design temperature 68% of the time. For example, from Figure 2A, the uncertainty for the Cold Snow Forest for a 1-year period is 3.6°C. This can be interpreted that the probability is 68% that the difference in a 99.6% dry-bulb in any given year will be within 3.6°C of the long-term 99.6% dry-bulb. Similarly, there is a 68% probability that the 99.6% dry-bulb from any 10-year period will be within 1°C of the long-term value for a location of the Cold Snow Forest climate type. Table 4 Locations Representing Various Climate Types Cold Snow Forest Dry Warm Rainy Tropical Rainy Portland, ME Amarillo, TX Huntsville, AB Key West, FL Grand Island, NE Bakersfield, CA Wilmington, NC West Palm Beach, FLMinot, ND Sacramento, CA Portland, OR Indianapolis, IN Phoenix, AZ Quillayute, WA 28.8 2005 ASHRAE Handbook—Fundamentals (SI) Fig. 2 Uncertainty versus Period Length for Various Dry-Bulb Temperatures, by Climate Type Fig. 2 Uncertainty versus Period Length for Various Dry-Bulb Temperatures, by Climate Type The uncertainty for the cold season is higher than the warm sea- son. For example, the uncertainty for the 99.6% dry-bulb for a 10- year period ranges from 0.6 to 1.0°C for the five climate types, whereas the uncertainty for the 0.4% dry-bulb for a 10-year period ranges from 0.4 to 0.6°C. A variety of other general characteristics of uncertainty are evi- dent from an inspection of Figure 2. For example, the highest uncer- tainty of any climate type for a 10-year period is 1.1°C for the Cold Snow Forest 99% dry-bulb case. The smallest uncertainty is 0.2°C for the Tropical Rainy 1% and 2% dry-bulb cases. Based on these results, it was concluded that using a minimum of 8 years of data would provide reliable (within ±1°C) climatic design calculations for most stations. Frequency and Duration of Episodes Exceeding the Design Dry-Bulb Temperature Design temperatures based on annual percentiles indicate how many hours each year on average the specific conditions will be exceeded, but do not provide any information on the length or frequency of such episodes. As reported in ASHRAE (2004b), Climatic Design Information 28.9 each episode and its duration for the locations in Table 4 during which the 2001 design conditions represented by the 99.6, 99, 0.4, 1, and 2% dry-bulb temperatures were exceeded (i.e., were more extreme) was tabulated and their frequency of occurrence ana- lyzed. The measure of frequency is the average number of epi- sodes per year or its reciprocal, the average period between episodes. Cold- and warm-season results are presented in Figures 3A and B respectively, for Indianapolis, IN, as a representative example. The duration for the 10-year period between episodes more extreme than the 99.6% design dry-bulb is 37 h, and 62 h for the 99% design dry-bulb. For the warm season, the 10-year period durations corre- sponding to the 0.4, 1, and 2% design dry-bulb, are about 10, 12, and 15 h, respectively. Although the results in ASHRAE (2004b) varied somewhat among the locations analyzed, generally the longest cold-season episodes last days, whereas the longest warm-season episodes were always shorter than 24 h. These results were seen at almost all loca- tions, and are general for the continental United States. The only exception was Phoenix, where the longest cold-season episodes were less than 24 h. This is likely due to the southern latitude and dry climate, which produces a large daily temperature range, even in the cold season.

The frequency vectors used to calculate the simple design conditions, and the joint fre- quency matrices used to calculate the coincident design conditions, are available as a separate ASHRAE product, the Weather Data Viewer, Version 3.0 (WDViewer 3.0) (ASHRAE 2005). The WDViewer 3.0 gives users full access to the frequency vectors and joint frequency matrices for all 4422 stations in the 2005 ASHRAE Handbook—Fundamentals via a spreadsheet. The WDViewer 3.0 provides the following capabilities: • Select a station by WMO number or region/country/state/name or by proximity to a given latitude and longitude • Retrieve design climatic conditions for a specified station, in SI or I-P units • Display frequency vectors and joint frequency matrices in the form of numerical tables • Display frequency distribution and the cumulative frequency dis- tribution functions in graphical form • Display joint frequency functions in graphical form • Display the table of years and months used for the calculation • Calculate the n-year mean extreme maximum and minimum tem- perature return periods for any value of n. The Engineering Weather Data CD (NCDC 1999), an update of Air Force Manual 88-29, was compiled by the U.S. Air Force Combat Climatology Center. This CD contains several tabular and graphical summaries of temperature, humidity, and wind speed information for hundreds of locations in the United States and around the world. In particular, it contains detailed joint frequency tables of temperature and humidity for each month, binned at 0.5°C and 3 h local time-of-day intervals. The International Station Meteorological Climate Summary (ISMCS) is a CD-ROM containing climatic summary information for over 7000 locations around the world (NCDC 1996). Only sev- eral hundred of these locations have observed hourly weather data. A table providing the joint frequency of dry-bulb temperature and wet-bulb temperature depression is provided for the locations with hourly observations. It can be used as an aid in estimating design conditions for locations for which no other information is available. A Web version of this product is now under development and should be available in early 2005. The monthly frequency distribution of dry-bulb temperatures and mean coincident wet-bulb temperatures for 134 Canadian loca- tions is available from Environment Canada (1983-1987). Degree Days and Climate Normals Heating and cooling degree-day summary data for over 4000 U.S. stations are available online at no cost at http://www5. ncdc.noaa.gov/climatenormals/clim81_supp/CLIM81_Sup_02.pdf (NCDC 2002a, 2002b). This publication presents annual heating degree day normals to the following bases (°F): 65, 60, 57, 55, 50, 45, and 40; and annual cooling degree day normals to the following bases (°F): 70, 65, 60, 57, 55, 50, and 45. The 1971-2000 climate normals for the United States are also available online and on CD from the National Climatic Data Center; further information can be found at http://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/nor- mals.html and http://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/oa/documentlibrary/pdf/ eis/c23a.pdf (NCDC 2002a, 2002c). The Canadian Climate Normals for 1971 to 2000 are available from Environment Canada at http://climate.weatheroffice.ec.gc.ca (Environment Canada 2003). The Climatography of the United States No. 20 (CLIM20), Monthly Station Climate Summaries for 1971-2000 are climatic station summaries of particular interest to engineering, energy, 28.10 2005 ASHRAE Handbook—Fundamentals (SI) industry, and agricultural applications (NCDC 2004). These sum- maries contain a variety of statistics for temperature, precipitation, snow, freeze dates, and degree-day elements for 4273 stations. The statistics include means, median (precipitation and snow ele- ments), extremes, mean number of days exceeding threshold val- ues, and heating, cooling, and growing degree days for various temperature bases. Also included are probabilities for monthly precipitation and freeze data. Information on this product can be found at http://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/oa/documentlibrary/pdf/eis/ clim20eis.pdf. Heating and cooling degree-day and degree-hour data for 3677 locations from 115 countries were developed by Crawley (1994) from the Global Daily Summary (GDS) version 1.0 and the Interna- tional Station Meteorological Climate Summary (ISMCS) version 4.0 data. Typical Year Data Sets Software is available to simulate the annual energy performance of buildings requiring a 1-year data set (8760 h) of weather condi- tions. Many data sets in different record formats have been devel- oped to meet this requirement. The data represent a typical year with respect to weather-induced energy loads on a building. No explicit effort was made to represent extreme conditions, so these files do not represent design conditions. Weather Year for Energy Calculations Version 2 (WYEC2) for 52 U.S. and 5 Canadian locations is available from ASHRAE (ASHRAE 1997d). A user manual and software toolkit explain the development, format, and characteristics of these data and provide access and toolkit software. Typical Meteorological Year Version 2 (TMY2) files are avail- able for 239 U.S. locations from the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (Marion and Urban 1995). These were produced using an objective statistical algorithm to select the most typical month from the long-term record. These files were originally intended for the design of solar energy systems, so solar radiation values were weighted heavily. Canadian Weather Year for Energy Calculation (CWEC) files for 47 Canadian locations were developed for use with the Canadian National Energy Code, using the TMY algorithm and software (Environment Canada 1993). Examples of the use of these files for energy calculations in both residential and commercial buildings, including the differences among the files, are available in Crawley (1998) and Huang (1998). Seasonal Percentiles of Dew-Point Temperature Seasonal percentiles of dew-point temperature are available for 381 U.S. and Canadian locations in ASHRAE (1995), with their development summarized in Colliver et al. (1995). Sequences of Extreme Temperature and Humidity Durations ASHRAE (1997b) and Colliver et al. (1998) compiled extreme sequences of 1-, 3-, 5-, and 7-day duration for 239 U.S. (SAMSON data) and 144 Canadian (CWEEDS data) locations based indepen- dently on the following five criteria: high dry-bulb temperature, high dew-point temperature, high enthalpy, low dry-bulb tempera- ture, and low wet-bulb depression. For the criteria associated with high values, the sequences are selected according to annual percen- tiles of 0.4, 1.0, and 2.0. For the criteria corresponding to low val- ues, annual percentiles of 99.6, 99.0, and 98.0 are reported. Although these percentiles are identical to those used to select annual heating and cooling design temperatures, the maximum or minimum temperatures within each sequence are significantly more extreme than the corresponding design temperatures. The data included for each hour of a sequence are solar radiation, dry-bulb and dew-point temperature, atmospheric pressure, and wind speed and direction. Accompanying information allows the user to go back to the source SAMSON and CWEEDS data and obtain sequences with different characteristics (i.e., different probability of occurrence, windy conditions, low or high solar radiation, etc.). These extreme sequences are available on CD (ASHRAE 1997a). These sequences were developed primarily to assist the design of heating or cooling systems having a finite capacity before regeneration is required or of systems that rely on thermal mass to limit loads. The information is also useful where information on the hourly weather sequence during extreme episodes is required for design. Global Weather Data Source Web Page Because of growing demand for more comprehensive global coverage of weather data for HVAC applications around the world, ASHRAE sponsored research project RP-1170 (ASHRAE 2001) to construct a Global Weather Data Source (GWDS) Web page. With the growth of the World Wide Web, many national cli- mate services and other climate data sources are making more information available over the Internet. The purpose of RP-1170 was to provide ASHRAE membership with easy access to major sources of international weather data through one consolidated system via the Web. A survey was distributed to over 100 poten- tial weather data providers in an effort to gather information on type of data, ordering information, inventory information, cost, etc. Responses were received from 30 different data providers. For many of the countries that did not respond to the survey, the GWDS Web page contains a URL or other link to that country’s weather service or data provider. Users select a country from a map or country list, choose the type (e.g., hourly, daily, monthly) and element of climate data, and then receive a list of data sources along with information on how to obtain that data. The GWDS Web page is accessible at http://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/ASHRAE/ gwds-title.html. Observational Data Sets For detailed designs, custom analysis of the most appropriate long-term weather record is best. National weather services are generally the best source of long-term observational data. The WMO World Data Center A at the National Climatic Data Center in Asheville, NC, collects and makes available a significant vol- ume of archived weather observations from around the world. Environment Canada also provides access to historical weather observations. The National Climatic Data Center (NCDC), in conjunction with the Federal Climate Complex (FCC), developed the global Inte- grated Surface Hourly (ISH) database (Lott 2004; Lott et al. 2001) to address a pressing need for an integrated global database of hourly land surface climatological data. The database of approxi- mately 20,000 stations has hourly data from as early as 1900 (many stations beginning in the 1948-1973 timeframe) and is operationally updated with the latest available data. The SAMSON and CWEEDS data sets provide long-term hourly data, including solar radiation values for the United States and Can- ada. The National Renewable Energy Laboratory is currently head- ing a project to update the National Solar Radiation Database, which was used to build SAMSON. A new solar model is required because of the implementation of automated observing systems that do not report traditional cloud elements. An updated SAMSON for 1971-2000 is expected in early 2007. Considerable information about weather and climate services and data sets is available through the World Wide Web. Informa- tion supplementary to this chapter may also be posted on the ASHRAE Technical Committee 4.2 Web site, the link to which is available from the ASHRAE Web site (www.ashrae.org).
