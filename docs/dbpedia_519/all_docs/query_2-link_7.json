At noon the senate was proceeding with routine bu.«iness while attempts wen- being made to bring in ihe two absent members, Sen- ator>' Swanson of Fridley and Kline of Chaska, both of whom were out of town and both said to be sick. Neither town is far from Ft. Paul, and it was expected that both would be brought in or that medical evidence of their inability to com*- would be se- cured. The two bills, with the veto messages, reached the senate shortly after the opening of this mornings ses- sion, having been held back by the house organization until tlie senate friends of the bills were ready for ac- tion.

April 22. — The pope was muih less troubled by his cough today and he was also without fever. As this was the sixth consecutive day on which his temperature has not risen above ncrmal, the physicians decided that they would shortly be able to limit their vitiits to one daily. Climatic conditions evidently influ- ence the pope's health to a great ex- tent. Today was heavy and cloudy and the siroVo or diy wind blew from Africa, all tending to depress the pon- tiff greatly. In spite of thi.-^ he was 1 anxious to resume work. This desire for activity is stiil the great difficulty with v.hich the doctors and tiie at- tendants iiave t<' contend. HENRY O.

St. I'aul, Mion., April 22. — (Special to The Herald.) — Two measures of the first importance, and one of widespread interest, reached the final legislative stage yesterilay afternoon and will now go to the governor for his signature, which they will receive. The first is the workingmen's com- [>ensation law, which repassed the house late yesterday afternot>n by a vote of 84 to ]. only Former Speaker H. M. Dunn voting in the negative.

Pittsburg, Pa., April 22.— The first fatality attending the \"strikes\" of school children organized as protests against Supt. f?. L. Heeter, occurred to- day when a boy, marching with a hun- dred or more of his companions in Penn avenue, was run down by a street car and killed. The \"strike\" was begun yesterday soon after Mr. Heeter who had been ac<iuitted of serious charges preferred against liim by a domestic in his family had returned to work. The strike spread to a number of school buildings this morning. Reports received from four schools showed that scarcely 25 per cent of the pupils were in their places, and at other schools tlie \"strik- ers\" said to have been encouraged by their parents, endeavorefl to prevent pupils not In sympathy with the move- ment from entering the buildings. A feature of the morning was the marching through the down-town streets of a party of several hundred children, none of whom appeared to be more than a dozen years old. They carried banners demanding the removal of the superintendent. Poller ReMerveH Called. All police reserves were called out. Because of the character of 'the ■rioters' the police were almost at a loss to handle the situation, but suc- ceeded in dispersing some of the leatherings by talking with the older children that were leaders. •The strike\" continued to spread and reports are coming in from school after school, that the children have refused to attend the sessions and arc parading about the neighborhood of the school buildings.

Brussels, April 22. — The Belgian gov- ernn>ent is reported to be about to accept a compromise and thus bring to an end the political strike of half a million workers who demand equal suffrage. The strike has crippled in- dustry and commerce in Belgium for the past ten days. Information obtained from an au- thoritative source indicated that the premier and the other members of the cabinet would yield during the session of the chamber of deputies this after- noon and accept the arrangement sug- gested by the Liberal leader.

ALBERT, KING OF BELGIANS. TO LEGISLATE ON CURRENCY Banking Committee Meets After Conference With President Wilson. CLEAN-UP TIME. Washington, April 22. — Secretary Bryan's preliminary plans for a world- wide peace movement probably will be laid informally before the senate for- eign relations committee tomorrow. Mr. Bryan has been at work for some time upon a crystallization of his ideas for international peace and it is under- stood that he is now prepared to rec- ommend a series of world-wide treat- ies for the submission of all disputes to arbitration and a limitation upon armaments. The usual course of discussing his peace plans first with members of the senate committee, has been chosen. It is understood, 'to pave the way in the senate for any subsequent treaties that may be Introduced. While members of the senate generally favored the arbitration treaties, negotiated with Great Britain and. France during for- mer President Taffs administration, those conventions were practically de- feated because the senate would not accept the provision for the submis- sion of all disputes to arbitration. Mr. Bryan's suggestions as to the limitation' of armament, it is said, will include the proposal that when vital questions have been submitted to a commission of Inquiry, neither coun- try, partv to the dispute, shall In any way increase its armament or make further preparation for war until the commission has reported its findings.

Washington, April 22. — Chairman Owc/i of the senate banking and cur- rency committee called its members together toOay and advised them of re- sults of informal conferences with I'resident Wilson, Secretary McAdoo and Chairman Glass, of the house banking committee on the subject of currency reforms. Hearings are to be arranged to be followed by Joint ses- sions of the currency committee of both house and senate, preparatory to currency legislation at the extra ses- sion of congress, provided that the tariff i.s disposed of without unfore- seen delay. Senator CJwen and Representative Glass have been looked upon as tlie men v.-ho will frame a measure to be known as the Owen-Glass bill to be Introduced at the same time in both houses and carrying with it adminis- tration approval. \\\\ hile there has been no final agreement as to the features of currency reform, certain prevalent Ideas, some of which eventually may be found in the bill, became known to- day. These include: RcMcrve UankM. 1 — Fifteen regional reserve banks which would act as fi.scal agents for the government, receiving deposits of public money.*;, acting as banks of dis- count for the banks in their respective regions and receiving a part of the reserves of the banks of the country. Currency would be issued through the regional reserve banks. I'ractically all the capital stock of these institu- tions as well as any accruing profits would be the jiroperty of the banks of each region. 2 — A govern inir board to supervise Washington, April 22.— With the en- tire ways and means committee in ses- sion today for the first time.

The report, submitted bv Chairman Pnderwood, after outlining the oper- ations of the proposed Income tax, said: •The revenues from all Income taxes readily respond to changes of rates and the latter can be raised or lowered within a few days' time without busi- ness disturbances such as general tar- iff changes occasion.

After forcing a passage through the Ice two miles above the point and within four miles of the down bound steamers, the car ferry St. Ignace was forced to return again to the Soo. She reports making scarcely any headway. Ice is windrowed twenty to forty feet in places. A strong south- east wind is necessary to help get tlie ice moving and is the only thing that will effectually oi>en a passage. The ice would pack in behind her as fast as she went forward. The steam- ers above the point are all l<jaded with grain which w^as stored in tliem for the winter.

There wintered at Duluth sixty-one vessels and at the Canadian Head o* the Lakes there were sixty-two. That means that there are approximately 123 vessels headed down the lakes, or about to get under headway. Now these must arrive at Buiiaio some time. There aie also numerous vessels headed Buffalowards from Chicago and othei Lake Michigan points. The long and short of it, according to vesselmen, is that Buffalo is going to have a very strenuous time of it. Just as soon as the break occurs in the ice in the neighborhood of Whitefisii point there will be a lleet of vessels loadfd with grain and other products in a mad race for Buffalo. One hun- dred and twenty-three vessels is some avalanche ' and there are others to come. So far as the coming up matter is concern^■d there will not be the de- mand on elevators, ore docks, etc.. as below. The chief delay up this way will be the unloading'of coal. Since last reports fourteen boats have left the harbor, presumably for lower lake ports. As to whether or not they will get there very soon Is an- other question. Thirteen have grain on board and one has ore. No package freighters have left the harbor yet and will not until conditions at White- fish point are actually known. The package freiglit companies, sensibly, shore freight men say. are content to stay in harbor and let the others bat- tle the ice packs. News from the Soo is to the effect that while Capt. Con Flynn of Duluth feels that it is folly to buck the ice crest around about Whitefish point, he it; going to tackle it again today. Many ships are incased in ice there- abouts bound both up and down and tlieir owners are anxious. A number here last night and to- wav down to the Ice- bound fleet, but, if conditions as wired from the eastern part of the lake are true, they will not get through for at least a week. A serious feature is the probable lack of provisions in case t-he blockade hold.s. And that has been predicted for some -time. But every captain who thinks he is well provisioned takes a chance.

THE SECRET OF SUCCESS Geniiine Merit Requited to Win People's Confidence, tiie TWO BODIES ARE FOUND IN CELLAR Have you ever stopped to reason v.'hy It is that so many products that are extensively advertised, all at once drop out of sight and are soon forgotten? The reason is plain — the article did not fulfil the promises of the manufacturer. This applies more particularly to a medicine. A me- dicinal preparation that has real cur- ative value almost sells itself, as Hlie an endless chain system the remedy is recommended by those who have been cured, to those who are in need of It. In an interview on the subject a prominent local druggist says \"Take for example Dr. Kilmer's Swamp- Root, a preparation I have sold for many years and never hesitate to rec- omntend, for in almost every case It .shows immediate results, as many of my customers testify. No other liid- ney remedy that I know of has so large a sale.\" The success of Dr. Kilmer's Swamp- Root is due to the fact that It fulfils every wish in overcoming kidney, liver and bladder diseases, corrects urinary- troubles and neutralizes the uric acid which causes rheumatism.

Mother and Daughter Evi- dently Murdered in St. Louis; Sister Held, St. Louis, Mo., April 22. — The bodies of Mrs. Ernestine Komnichau and her daughter, Selma, were found shortly before noon today buried in the base- ment of a building at No. 2412 South Broadway. Marie Koranlchau, another daughter, was arrested at the city hospital shortly after noon for an in- vestigation in connection with the mystery. \"The sister, Marie, .was taken to the city hospital two weeks ago, after she had broken her leg in a fall down stairs. A week before that time neighbors noticed the absence of her mother and sister and Inquired about them. Marie replied that her sister Selma, had died and that the mother had taken the body to Illinois for burial. The finding of the bodies resulted from a visit which the owner of the building, Albert Stuhr, made to the premises about 10 o'clock this morn- ing. He noticed a peculiar odor and telephoned to police headquarters that something was wrong about the build- ing. An Investigation by two detectives resulted in the finding of a iiewly made grave. A little work and the feet of a woman were uncovered. Still thinking that only one woman was buried in the basement, the detectives continued the work of uncovering the body. Further search resulted in the finding of the second body. « A speed of fifty miles an hour has been attained by a motorcycle equipped with a new engine which weighs but ten pounds, yet develops G-horse pow- er.

TKc Rigkt Hat for tke Right Woman Not a hat, but the hat, is waiting here in the millinery salon for you. We can say this because the display is so varied in character that somewhere in it there is \"a hat for every face.\" Some faces need the soft little draped toquo, some the tailored turban. Some look best shaded by the drooping \"picture\" style, others with the \"baby\" type of hat, to bring out a certain childlike expreSBion so appealing in a woman's face. Whatever it need.s, somewhere in this big collection the par- ticular hat Is to be found.

Threatenlncr letters of all descrip- tions are cominjf tu the office of Com- missioner William A. Hicken, lioad of the division of public safety, since he clamped a real lid on Dulutli in furth- erance of the law enforcement admin- istration which lias been inaugurated. The letters are all aUlte in that they are anonymous and aro being accorded the same treatment, tlio wastebasltet, where they are deposited witliout even being seen by Commissioner Hicken. lestcrday afternoon a most fear- some-looking epistle was deposited on llie desk of Secretary Harris Trux. It was decorated with a black smear meant to portray tho insignia of the Mafia, the blacltnand. In what was a painfully disguised hand the writer de- clared tliat a terrible vengeance would bo wreaked upon Commissioner Hicken if he did not desist in his policy of law enforcement, in red ink tlie de- mand was made, on penalty of dire l>unishment, tiiat he let Duluth con- tinue as an open town, with privileges extended to the saloons and no inter- ference with the segregated district. Other Letters !«imllar. others letters of a similar nature have been coming in since the saloons were directed to observe the legal clos- ing hours, and tlie dispensation of liquor and music were barred in the red light district. They have not been adorned with the sign of the black- Ixand but they have contained threats of various natures. After the first communications of that nature had bcfn seen by Commis- sioner Hicken he instructed his secre- tary to take care of them. He said that lie does not approve of letters which do not bear the name of the writer any more tlian he can look wltlt favor upon persons who hide behind anonymous signatures. All letters of that kind are now finding their way to the waste pap<*r basket, whence they are conveyed nightly to the furnace. Wherefore it is apparent that time spent in penning letters of that char- acter is just So much labor wasted. The lid continues to fit Duluth very snugly. It is not Impossible that tliere may be a leak or two, but tliey are of the most .secretive and guarded kind. .\\3 soon as a saloon keeper Is found violating the regulations he will lose liis licen.se. The red light continues In existence Iiut in a very quiet way. The \"gimp\" was taken out of it when the sale of intoxicants and the music and dancing were prohibited. At the first orders about forty women left the city for other places. A few of tliem have re- turned, having learned that the district was not to be immediately closed.

Chicago, April 22. — A writ of habeas corpus, returnable immediately, was is- sued today by Judge George Kersten in the case of E. C. C. Von Klein Min- neapolis diamond broker, charged with swindling, through marriage, several women in various states. The writ was obtained by Attorney Charles Erb- stein while the latter's partner was defending Von Klein in another court where his hearing on a fugitive war- rant was taking place. Erbstein'.s move was intended to de- feat the removal of his client to Port- land, Or., for trial on a charse of de- frauding Ethel Newcomb of several thousand dollar.s In jewels after pre- tending to marr.v her. The effect of the writ was to bring the entire case into Judge Kersten's court. Erbsteln declared that Von Klein is not a fugitive from justice and that he was not in the various states at the times the crynes chargvd against him were committed. The attorney explained that he wished to thresh out the entire case in Chicago. CUIM AGAINST WILSON ESTATE Heirs Allege Hackman Be- friended Plaintiff in Present Suit. A claim of $628.32 brought by Michael Jordan against the estate of Jolin (Jack) Wilson, a well known Duluth hackman, who died leaving a small for- tune of about $8,500, is being pressed in district court this morning. Jordan claims that he was employed by Wilson to take care of the latter's barn and liorses, but that no settlement has ever been made. He asks for $8 a week during a ^considerable period of time. The claim was disallowed In probate court and is In district court on an ap- peal. The case Is being tried before Judge Cant and a jury. The Wilson estate, represented by Leo A. Ball, attorne.v, claims that Wil- .son was never indebted at any time to Jordan, and that as a matter of fact, Wilson had allowed him to sleep in a room at the barn. An interesting feature of the case is that both Wilson and Jordan are na- tives of Hamilton, Ont. Jordan Is 57 years old. Wilson'.s heirs consist of a father and several brothers residing at Hamilton. Become a Man Among Men or a woman among women by starting an account at Our Savings Department and deposit weekly.

Railroads SUGGESTIONS FROM COURT CHARGED WITH CARELESS DRIVING MAIL CARRIERS WILL BE REROUTED W. G. Weld, assistant postmaster of Duluth, stated today that numerous changes were contemplated In the routing of the mail carriers. Changes would have to be made on account of the rapid growth of the suburbs of the city It was probable, he said, that the rerouting would be done after the close of the fiscal year on July 1. The record of parcel post business done by the local postofflce last week shows no diminution from any pre- vious weeks. The parcels received at the Duluth postofflce for distribution numbered 8,G48. of which 616. weigh- ing between four and eleven pounds, wore distributed by the wagon used for that purpose. The rest, all of which were small, were distributed by the foot carriers. \"LOOK UP— YOU CAN'T MISS IT.\" MASHER GIVEN JAIL SENTENCE Fact That He Was Drunk Does Not Influence Court. ex- Pleading drunkenness will not cuse any one for Insulting women In Duluth. \"Mashing\" will not be tolerated, whether the \"masher\"' be drunk or That position was set forth V)y Judge Windom in police court today when \\Villiam McGraw. a young man who has been a resident of Duluth for manj' vear-s was arraigned on a charge of di'^orderlv conduct. McGraw entered a i.lna of guilty and when the police re- ported that he J»ad made indecent ad- vances to two respectable women near Third\" avenue west and Superirjr street about 10:30 last night. Judge ^ indom gave him a straight sentence of thirty davs in the county jail. \\fter sentence had been Imposed McGraw pleaded with the court to be more lenient with him. He offered drui'kenness as an extenuating circum- stance. With lips quivering and tears starting to his eyes he declared that he would never have done or thought of The Home Doctor Remotly for Couglis and Cold.s.

The police court will co-operate with the police in stamping It out should it appear. The straight jail sen- tence meted to McGraw this morning is a sample of.what others will get who are arre.sted for mashing or making im- proper remarks to girls or women on Duluth streets. TRIED tOWORK OLD CON GA^E Chauffeur Who Knocked Woman Down Appears in Police Court. M. C. Miller, a chauffeur, was ar- raigned In police court this morning on a charge of driving his machine In a careless manner last Sunday after- noon. It is claimed that he bumped into Mrs. Carl Mork. knocking her down, while crossing Third avenue west. Miller pleaded not guilty and his trial was set for tomorrow afternoon. He asserted that Mrs. Mork dodged in front of the car and that the accident was unavoidable. He .stated that he was traveling at a very low rate of speed and stopped before the machine had gone over a foot. Mrs. Mork was not injured. Jacob Foster, Given Bad Record By Police, Draws Ninety Days, Jacob Foster, said by the police to be a bad egg, was given the alternative of ?100 fine or ninety days In the county jail yesterday afternoon when he plead- ed guilty to \"vagrancy. The police repoi ted that Foster was arrested when he tried to work a bunco game on a man who was en route to Winnipeg. Another man happened to overhear the conversation and informed a policeman, who placed Foster under arrest. His pal escaped. The police claim that Foster was trying to work the traveler with an old con proposition. He found out where the man was going and immed- iately found himself bound for the same destination. Foster had some furniture which he wanted to ship. He had a big check and couldn't get anybody to cash It for him. He was willing to leave the whole check with the trav- eler, provided he would advance $150 or $200 on it, just enough to pay liis necessary expenses. But before he got far enough to find out whetlier or not the intended \"sucker\" would fall, the police interfered. The officers state that Foster worked rather a neat dodge to learn how much of a roll the traveler had with him. WILL RECEIVE $350 FROM CITY.

St. Paul, Minn., April 22. — Sugges- tions concerning the dissolution of the Union Paclflc-Soutliern Pacific mergar with regard to the plan Informally presentf'd by Robert H. Lovett, repr^^- senting the Union Pacific, were made by United States Circuit Judges Wal- t<»r H. Sanborn. Willia«i C. Hook and Walter I. Smith to Mr, Lovett last night and made public todav. The statement sa.vs: \"Circuit court Judges Sanborn, Hook and Smith are not con- cerning themselves regarding the sr.le of Central Pacific stock as this phase of the situation was not mentioned in tentative plan, but are confining their attention to the disposition of the $126,650,000 of Southern Pacific stock which is now unlawfully held by the Union Pacific Railroad company. In this connect^m the following sugges- tions have ueen submitted by the judges to counsel for the Union Pa- cific and also to District Attorney Houpt of St. Paul, representating the government for Attorney General Mc- Reynolds, as a guidance In future dis- solution proceedings: \"1. Any plan for disposing of the $126.6.'>0,000 of Southern Pacific stock owned by the Union Pacific company should have regard to the amount of Southern Pacific stock already owned by Union Pacific stockholders, so that the pre.<?ent holdings of these stock- holders as a body shall not, by the affirmative action of this court, be increased to the point of practical con- trol of the competing company. \"2. In the memorandum of March 1, 1913, submitted by counsel for the Union Pacific, It was said *to a very large extent the 23,000 Individual stockholders of the Union Pacific are also Included among the 15,000 stock- ers of the Southern Pacific company. \"3, It was Intimated at a time when It was supposed that Union Pa- cific stockholder-^ did not hold more than $50,000,000 of the stock of the Southern Pacific company that not more than $40,000,000 of the Southern Pacific stock should be transferred to Union Pacific stockholders. It now appears that the stock books of the two companies of February-, 1913, show that 4,440 Union Pacific stockholders also own $92,162,400 of Southern Pa- cific stock exclusive of the $120,650,- OOO of stock Involved In this suit. Among these 4.440 stockholders are brokerage concerns whose principals are undisclosed, but If they are ex- cluded the fact would still remain that individual Union Pacific stockholder.? own a very large amount of Southern Pacific stock. In view of these facts. it seems that the disposition of aa much as $40,000,000 of Southern Pacific stock, with voting power to the stock- holders of the Union Pacific company might give practical control of that company to Union Pacific stockholders and the question what amount if .any. of Southern Pacific stock may be <»afe- Iv transferred to them Is suggested for argument and consideration.\" • ♦ Railroad Personals.

PRESIDENTlvirSON PROTESTS AGAINST DISCRIMII^ATION IN CALIFORNIA ANTI- ALIEN LAWS (Contlriued from page 1.) deferred lljat subject and immediately took up the alien land situation. Mr. Kaker told the president that if nis course in appealing to the legis- lature proved futile its influence might be lo cause the submission of any iaw passed tc> a referendum.

TO LEGISLATE ON CURRENCY (Continued from page 1.) the r<gl(nal reserve banks would be established to consist of the secretary of the treasury, the secretary of agri- culture and the comptrcdler of the cur- rency as ex-officlo memb»rs; four di- rectors appointed by the president of the United Slates. It is planned to have seven to nine members, the ten- ure of the directors, selected by the banks to be longer than that of the other directors. I'reMent Iiin«ti«tn. 3 — The elatticitv oi tiie currency wculd be provided for l>y conditions calculated to prevent Inflation. Any notes issued would be redeemable in gold by providing a reseivt- for actual gold redt-mption. There has In «'n some question as to wheth»r these notes sliould be Cnited States notes ad- vanced to the banks upon an interest charge high enough to prevent infla- tion vr be bank not«s under like con- ditions. State banks would be re- quired lo Increase their reserves. 4 — The extent to whicli the reserves could bt used has not been determined but cine plan is in favor of permitting their use under a reasonable t.-ix. VVitii respect to the rate of discount, It has been variously suggested that the governing board might re<iulro the rate to be made progressive when there was an increasing demand for currency so as to stiffen the rate and attract gold somewhat after the sys- tem used by the Hank of lOugland. Retire R«»nd-Secared tnrreney. 5 — One ()f the plans suggested and which Representative Glass advocated In a recent speech was to retire the present bond-secur«d currency not at fince but over a period of ten to fifteen years which might Involve a refunding of the 2 per cent bonds with the cir- culation privilege into 3 per cent bonds without the circulation privi- leges. As the bond-secur*d currency would be rt tired, a substitute (Currency based on commercial paper of a fiuall- fied class would automatically take its place. The plan that will be evolved finally, the Democratic leaders assert, will be substantially different from the so- call«d Aldricli plan. There is talk t>f establishing branch banks abroad to obtain for American bankers a share of the foreign trade and commercial transactions. With re- spect to the subject of guaranteeing bank deposits, however, the currency advocates are practically unanimous that this should be kept separate from any currency bill and that if attempted RADICAL READJUSTMENT OF FISCAL POLICY OF U.S. PROVIDED IN TARIFF BILL (Continued from page 1.) revenue system, and at all times af- for.ling a substantial amount of reve- nue, congress could, and tf necessary should annually raise or lower the in- >o,rii; tax ratis In such manner as would prevent eillier a deficit or a sur- plus in the treasury.

A detailed table was firese rited, show- ink by schedules, the total revenue se- < tired under tin- I'ayne law for 1912, an<l the eKtimatCfi revenue under the new law for a twelve— me)nth i>eriod.
