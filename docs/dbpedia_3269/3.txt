Here are some of the sporting highlights of the world of sport in 2009.

On March 3rd, in an incident that shocked the entire sporting world, the Sri Lankan cricket team was attacked by terrorists while heading to the stadium for playing a match. Fortunately no player was seriously injured in the incident.

Juan Martin del Potro surprised the tennis world by winning the US Open that year. He defeated Rafael Nadal in the semi-finals and the then world No. 1 Roger Federer in the finals en-route to his only grand slam win thus far. Unfortunately Juan has since been hampered by frequent injuries that have severely curtailed his potential.

The US Open provided yet another surprise that year when Kim Clijsters won the women's title after a comeback from retirement. Kim was unranked at that time and was handed a wild card entry. This is the only time a wild card player has ever won a title.

Neymar Jr. is a household name now, but in March of 2009, the mid-fielder from Brazil made his debut in La Liga at only 17 years of age. Neymar played 48 games for Real Madrid and scored 14 goals in the season.

In a close contest between Chicago and Rio de Janeiro, that even saw Barrak Obama the President of the United States address the IOC, Rio was selected to host the 2016 Olympics. It is the first time the Olympics will be hosted in a South American country.

New York Yankees won their 27th World Series in their 40th appearance in the finals. Lance Armstrong was somewhat successful in his comeback, finishing third in the Tour de France behind the winner Spain's Alberto Contador (who also went on to win in 2010, but was later stripped of this win).

Nineteen people were killed and 135 were injured in a stampede in the Stade FÃ©lix HouphouÃ«t-Boigny in Abidjan, CÃ´te d'Ivoire, before a 2010 FIFA World Cup qualification match between Malawi and CÃ´te d'Ivoire.
