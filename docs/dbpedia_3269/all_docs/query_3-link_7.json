        "text": "This is probably false.\n\nThe event, known as the \"Maracanazo\", happened on July 16, 1950.\n\nSome of the Brazilian main newspapers at time are still active and keep their archives available online. They reported some incidents with the fans on the next day's editions, but no completed suicides, let alone deaths by suicide inside the stadium:\n\nFolha de SÃ£o Paulo reported 8 deaths, and highlighted 3 had been caused by \"emotion\". Unfortunately, the text of that news is deteriorated and cannot be read, but it's safe to assume no completed suicides happened, since it would be worthy to be put in the title. On the 18, they reported a murder after a fight over the match, but again, no mentions of any deaths by suicide.\n\nO Estado de S. Paulo reported 169 injured people, victims of \"run-overs, falls and other accidents\". Again, no mention to any deaths by suicide.\n\nO Globo reported the same figure of 169 injured, and featured a \"dead by emotion\". They even went as far as reporting the name and address of every single injured/dead. O Globo is based in Rio de Janeiro, the city were the match took place, so I would assume they were in the best position compared to the previous sources. They never mentioned a death by suicide.\n\nOne interesting thing is that the alleged deaths by suicide are barely mentioned by Brazilian press when talking about the Maracanazo. One of the few Brazilian articles mentioning it quotes a journalist dismissing it as rumor:\n\n\"Many players left the field crying [...] It was a great trauma. There were stories about suicides too, but none were confirmed.\""
