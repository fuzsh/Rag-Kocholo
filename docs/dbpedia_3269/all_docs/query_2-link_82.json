        "text": "Since 3rd Degree has moved a couple of times, this post keeps getting lost in the void. Over the years it’s been by far the most asked for, requested, and clicked on things I’ve ever written.\n\nI first wrote this piece back in January of 2009, re-wrote it in 2013, again in 2017 as part of 3rd Degree’s 20th birthday celebration, and last year in 2019 with the move to the new independent site. With the current pause for Covid-19 I figured I could refresh it again for 2020.\n\nEvery time I re-do this post – this is the 5th pass of it – I’ve learned more and read more stories that I try and include. Hopefully, each time this piece gets better. I do update and freshen the lists of players with current players while still keeping old famous examples.\n\nI happen to take numbers very seriously, to me they have meaning. I have strong ideas about what should be worn and by whom. I think they are important.\n\nExcept they’re not. Wear what you want.\n\nBut if you’re trying to pick a number for yourself, or trying to understand why a pro wears what he does, then maybe this will help you by learning some history and meaning for the numbers.\n\nA Brief History of Numbers\n\nWhen our modern sports formed ages ago jerseys didn’t have numbers on them. Or names for that matter. Over time numbers were added to jerseys so fans and media could tell who players were from high in the stands.\n\nThe earliest soccer numbers were handed out based on the lineup. The starting eleven players wore numbers 1 to 11, starting with the keeper as the #1 and moving from the back to the front and right to left.\n\nTo make a long story short, the most common formation when numbering was beginning to be used was the 2-3-5.\n\nYes, that’s two defenders (#2, #3), three midfielders (#4, #5, #6), and five strikers (#7, #8, #9, #10, #11). Although some countries didn’t use numbers until the W-M was in vogue, which makes some small differences.\n\nEvery sport has a history with numbers. In the early days of baseball, the batting order wore numbers 1 to 9 based on the place they hit in the order. Babe Ruth wore 3 and Lou Gehrig 4 because they hit 3rd and 4th in the Yankee order. In college basketball – less so in the pros – numbers are mostly combinations of 0 to 5 like 5, 11, 23, 32, 41, etc. In American football, numbers indicate what position you play. Linebackers are 40s/50s, receivers used to be just 80s but now are also 1 to 19, running backs and DBs are 20s/30s/40s, etc.\n\nIn soccer as the shape of formations changed and evolved over the years the numbers moved in certain patterns depending on the country in which the evolution was taking place, particularly on defense chaos sometimes reigned. Numbers took on a positional meaning that could slowly change over the decades and might have different meanings depending on in which country you are asking.\n\nWhen substitutes were allowed in soccer (originally there was no subbing) the subs would wear numbers starting at 12 and going up to 17 or so, depending on how many bench players were allowed.\n\nPeople have written entire books on the evolution of tactics and you can spend a lifetime studying it. I’m going to try and explain it in a couple of paragraphs and won’t be doing it real justice.\n\nI personally recommend The Simplest Game: The Intelligent Fan’s Guide to the World of Soccer by Paul Gardner or Inverting the Pyramid by Jonathan Wilson for a far greater dissertation on the evolution of tactics.\n\nIn the modern era with the advent of television, the marketing of players, and the sales of jerseys, teams began to assign specific numbers to players for an entire season. Numbers began to become synonymous with players and names started appearing on the back of kits. Amazingly, a few leagues didn’t adopt the one number per player as a rule until the mid-90s.\n\nIn general terms, 1 to 11 remain the most coveted numbers. They are the pure, classic numbers of superstars and the soccer gods. In modern times the numbers in the teens and low 20s have become sought after due to 23 man world cup rosters.\n\nOnly in the last ten to fifteen years with the advent of the massive squads of large teams have we begun to see numbers in the 30s and 40s come into play. As examples, Spain by rule uses numbers 1 to 25 and France 1 to 30.\n\nWith the more recent aberrations of media hype and marketing strangeness, we see numbers like 66 and 99 in countries without number rules.\n\nLet’s run through them.\n\n1 to 11\n\nThe old school starting numbers, the most coveted and sought after numbers from the history of the game.\n\n1 – Goalkeeper\n\nProbably the most pristinely ubiquitous number in soccer is the #1 for the keeper. You just don’t see a field player wear this number. Ever. The 1 is the keeper, period. This rule should never, ever be broken*.\n\nIn fact, in some countries, the #1 kit is a keeper jersey by rule.\n\n*Side Note: Yet this rule was broken and worn in the field. In the 70s, a few countries wore jerseys numbers based on their alphabetical roster, notably Argentina and the Netherlands, so you saw field players with the 1 in the World Cup. I shudder to think of it.\n\nWorld: Peter Schmeichel, Lev Yashin, José Luis Chilavert, Oliver Kahn, Iker Casillas, Gianluigi Buffon, David de Gea, Manuel Neuer. Pretty much any first-choice keeper.\n\nUSA: Brad Friedel, Tim Howard.\n\nFCD: Mark Dodd, Matt Jordan, Kevin Hartman, Jesse Gonzalez.\n\nUsage that makes my head hurt: Any field player wearing #1. That’s just wrong.\n\nFCD Side Story: When Dario Sala joined FC Dallas he and Jeff Cassar both asked for the #1 jersey after Scott Garlick retired. Colin Clark decided that rather than picking someone for the #1 he would let neither have it until one of them won the job outright. Sala stayed with his higher 48 and then 44 even when Cassar was gone.\n\n2 – Right Back\n\nAlmost always a defender, and almost always the right back. The #2 has been the right-sided defender since numbers were added to the game and never moved. It does pop up in the middle of the defense on very rare occasions.\n\nWorld: Dani Alves (w/ Brazil), Dani Carvajal, Cafu, Gary Neville, Ivan Cordoba\n\nUSA: Frankie Hejduk, DeAndre Yedlin\n\nMLS: Tony Beltran, Jonathan Spector\n\nFCD: Eric Dade, Cory Gibbs, Reggie Cannon, Hernan Grana.\n\nUsage that makes my head hurt: Clint Dempsey’s adoption of the “Duce” moniker and the no. 2 jersey. He wore it as a kid and at Furman then carried it over to MLS. With the US, Dempsey wore the proper 8.\n\n3 – The Defender’s Defender\n\nThe purest pure defender, usually a center back and has been so since the earliest days when along with the no. 2 it was the first pair of defender numbers.\n\nSide note: Although Brits seem to think the 3 is a left back because for them the 5 and/or 6 dropped into the backline between the 2 and 3. Rather than the 3 staying in the middle of the defense with the 4 – or the 6 in South America – dropping wide left. I know, brits are funny.\n\nWorld: Pablo Maldini, Jaap Stam, Pique, Giorgio Chiellini, Ashley Cole, Lucio\n\nUSA: Gregg Berhalter, Carlos Bocanegra, Omar Gonzalez, Matt Miazga\n\nMLS: Drew Moor, Ike Opara, Michael Parkhurst\n\nFCD: Ryan Suarez, Carey Talley, Greg Vanney, Ugo Ihemelu, Reto Ziegler\n\nUsage that makes my head hurt: Ex-MLSer Calen Carr was a striker who wore the #3.\n\n4 – The Shifter\n\nThis number is often a defender or wingback and occasionally a midfielder depending on the country or culture. 4 started on the right side of midfield so it is often thought of as a flank player, but can also be seen as a center back in many places… or as a holding mid if your British (see below the 5/6 being center backs in the UK).\n\nAs it was frequently one of the original three midfield numbers (4, 5, 6) that were shifted into the backline it’s commonly a defender’s number.\n\nFCD Side Note: For FC Dallas #4 has been a left back fairly frequently.\n\nWorld: Javier Zanetti, Sergio Ramos, Pep Guardiola, Patrick Vieira, Ivan Rakitic, Jurgen Kohler, Claude Makelele, Frank de Boer, Frank Rijkaard\n\nUSA: Michael Bradley, Tyler Adams\n\nMLS: Tyler Adams, Marvell Wynne, Greg Garza.\n\nFCD: Chris Gbandi (LB), Paul Broome (LB), Diego Sonora (RB), Andrew Jacobson (CM), Bressan (CB)\n\nUsage that makes my head hurt: Cesc Fabregas wears #4. According to Wikipedia, Fabregas idolized Barcelona’s captain #4 Pep Guardiola, who would later give Fàbregas his shirt as consolation when Fàbregas’ parents divorced.\n\n5 – Center Half\n\nThe #5 started as the central half in the 2-3-5 and in most places has stayed there.\n\nIn the US a “center half” remains a midfielder; in England, a “center half” is a central defender; in both places, the #5 is still often a center half. In South America, the 5 often stayed in the midfield as well.\n\nSo cultural background can dictate a lot in how this number is perceived in the midfield versus defense debate… but it’s almost universally central.\n\nWorld: Rio Ferdinand, Fabio Cannavaro, Carlos Puyol, Franz Beckenbauer, Sergio Busquets, Zinedine Zidane (w/ Madrid)\n\nUSA: Thomas Dooley, John O’Brien, Oguchi Onyewu, Matt Besler\n\nMLS: Kyle Beckerman, Matt Besler\n\nFCD: Lubos Kubik, Steve Jolley, Marcelo Saragosa, Tenywa Bonseu, Thiago Santos\n\nUsage that makes my head hurt: Jair Benitez wore #5 for FCD as a left back. Boo, Jair, boo.\n\n6 – Mr. Versatility\n\nPerhaps more than any other number the 6 can pop up in multiple locations all over the field depending on your culture. Like the 5, the 6 started out as a midfielder and in many soccer cultures, it stayed there. Mostly a central player’s number, not typically a flank player.\n\nIn the US, for example, this number is so completely ingrained as the holding-mid that we call the position “the 6.” We define a normal 4-3-3 midfield these days as a combo of 6-8-10.\n\nIn England, the 6 mostly migrated to center back dropping between the 2 and 3. In South American, notably Brazil, it migrated to left back or wingback.\n\nSide Note: The no. 6 is my number.\n\nDefense\n\nWorld: Franco Baresi, Roberto Carlos, Marcelo (w/ Brazil), Bobby Moore, Tony Adams\n\nUSA: Steve Cherundolo, John Brooks.\n\nMLS: Jay Heaps, Kofi Opare, Alexander Callens.\n\nFCD: Steve Morrow, Tom Soehn.\n\nMidfield\n\nWorld: Cristiano Zanetti, Xavi, Paul Pogba, Ronald de Boer, Matthias Sammer\n\nUSA: Brandi Chastain, Maurice Edu, Darlington Nagbe\n\nMLS: Osvaldo Alonso, Darlington Nagbe, Shea Salinas\n\nFCD: Ronnie O’Brien, Pablo Ricchetti, Jackson, Lazo Alavanja\n\nUsage that makes my head hurt: Anibal Chala being assigned the #6 for FC Dallas for an entire season without actually being here in Dallas.\n\n7 – Right Wing\n\nThe #7 is known worldwide as an attacking number worn by a player with flare usually playing out wide, in particular on the right wing. 7 started as the right wing across the front 5 and pretty much stayed there.\n\nIt can occasionally be left or even central depending on club and country, but it feels better on the right.\n\nSide Note: The history of the #7 at Manchester United alone is staggering: Jimmy Delaney, George Best, Bryan Robson, Eric Cantona, David Beckham, Michael Owen, and Christian Ronaldo… to name a few. Reinforcing why we don’t retire numbers in soccer.\n\nWorld: Luis Figo, David Villa, David Beckham, Cristiano Ronaldo, Raul, Kenny Dalglish, Eric Cantona, Johann Neeskens, Andriy Shevchenko\n\nUSA: Demarcus Beasley, Eddie Lewis, Bobby Convey\n\nMLS: Cristian Roldan, David Villa, Josef Martinez\n\nFCD: Mark Santel, Dave ven den Bergh, Jesus Ferreira, Eddie Johnson.\n\nUsages that makes my head hurt: Carlos Gruezo while at FC Dallas. 7 isn’t a holding-mid number, Carlos.\n\n8 – Heart of Midfield\n\nEight is the classic two-way possession (or linking) central midfielder. Short of the #10 the most dominant player in the spine of the team, creative and tough at the same time. A pure midfielder’s midfielder.\n\nThe 8 is so ingrained as the linking-mid we call that position, and that kind of player, an 8 even if there is more than one in the team. The base 4-3-3 often uses a double-8s, for example.\n\nFC Dallas side note: The eight is one of the more important numbers in FCD history because of Oscar Pareja.\n\nWorld: Philipe Cocu, Frank Lampard, Steven Gerrard, Gennaro Gattuso, Andrés Iniesta, Socrates, Dunga, Giuseppe Meazza, Hristo Stoitchkov, Toni Kroos\n\nUSA: Earnie Stewart, Clint Dempsey, Weston McKennie\n\nMLS: Jonathan dos Santos, Graham Zusi, Diego Valeri\n\nFCD: Oscar Pareja, Juan Toja, Richard Mulrooney, Victor Ulloa, Bryan Acosta\n\n9 – High Striker\n\nThis is the pure goal scorer, forever the center forward. The #9 is always the high target-striker.\n\nIt started in the center of the 5-man front line and never left. One of the two most significant numbers in football.\n\nWorld: Ronaldo, Alan Shearer, Robert Lewandowski, Ruud van Nistelrooy, Gabriel Batistuta, Alfredo Di Stefano, Hugo Sanchez, Marco van Basten, Bobby Charlton, Filippo Inzaghi, Patrick Kluivert, George Weah, and many, many more…\n\nUSA: Joe-Max Moore, Herculez Gomez, Mia Hamm, Gyasi Zardes\n\nMLS: Juan Pablo Angel, Jamie Moreno, Ante Razov, Zlatan\n\nFCD: Hugo Sanchez, Jason Kreis, Roberto Mina, Jeff Cunningham, David Texeira\n\nUsage that makes my head hurt: That time Ramon Nunez wore no. 9 for FC Dallas.\n\n10 – The Man\n\nThis is the Big Cheese, the Big Kahuna, El Jefe, the Boss. Wearing the #10 is saying “this is my team.” Wearing the #10 means you will carry the load and the burden both on and off the field. The names on this jersey are the all-time greats of the game. Forward, attacking mid, central mid, playmaker, sweeper even.\n\nPositionally, these days, “the 10” is what we call the attacking-mid or off-striker behind the #9, the playmaker.\n\nWorld: Pele, Maradona, Lionel Messi, Zinedine Zidane (w/ France), Lothar Matthaus, Ronaldinho, Denis Law, Francesco Totti, Alessandro Del Piero, Roberto Baggio, Zico, Dennis Bergkamp, Rivaldo, Ferenc Puskas…\n\nUSA: Tab Ramos, Claudio Reyna, Landon Donovan, Christian Pulisic\n\nMLS: Marco Etcheverry, Carlos Valderrama, Blanco, Landon Donovan, Giovani dos Santos, Sebastian Giovinco, Kaka\n\nFCD: David Ferreira, Dante Washington, Joselito Vaca, Mauro Diaz, Ramon Nunez\n\nUsage that makes my head hurt: Ricardo Iribarren once wore number 10 for the Dallas Burn as a marking back and cursed the franchise’s 10-jersey for years.\n\n11 – The Slasher\n\nThe other forward, perhaps a wing or wide midfielder with an attacking bent. Started as the left winger and has stayed a winger/slashing kind of player. More left-sided.\n\nWorld: Ryan Giggs, Didier Drogba, Robin Van Persie, Romario, Ángel Di María, Francisco Gento, Edgar Davids, Karl-Heinz Rummenigge, Miroslav Klose, Michael Laudrup\n\nUSA: Eric Wynalda, Brian Ching, Stuart Holden\n\nMLS: Javier Morales, Alejandro Bedoya\n\nFCD: Antonio Martinez, Damian Alvarez, Andre Rocha, Fabian Castillo, Santiago Mosquera\n\nUsage that makes my head hurt: Clarence Goodson grew up a forward so he switched to the #11 as a center back when it became available with FC Dallas.\n\nThe Classic 1 to 11 Formation in the United States\n\nAll of this leaves us with something like this for our original 11 as we see them today… give or take. Sorta… Some people want to swap 4 and 3 but I don’t.\n\n12 to 23\n\nIn the current era of 23-man international squads, the numbers 12 to 23 have become modern favorites and are sought after much more than they were, say, 15 to 20 years ago.\n\nPositionally they tend to shift around a lot more than 1-11 as they don’t have a traditional tactical interpretation.\n\nYou could expand this section up to 25 or even 30 if you want as some leagues have number rules and squads that big.\n\nLa Liga in Spain, for example, requires senior professional players to wear numbers 1 to 25 with the keeper in 1, 13, or 25. In France, the roster is 1 to 30 with 1, 16, and 30 reserved for goalkeepers.\n\n12 – High Impact\n\nTraditionally the 12 was the first sub listed, which often meant the keeper in ages past.\n\nNow the number twelve is a large contributor to the team, and in most recent years has begun to transform into an attacking style player and is a frequent starter in large squads. The 12 is sometimes chosen as double 6 (holding mid?) or as 2+10 (right back).\n\nWorld: Marcelo Vieira (w/ Madrid), Olivier Giroud, Julio Cesar, Alex Sandro, Giovanni van Bronckhorst\n\nUSA: Jay DeMerit, Jimmy Conrad, Brad Guzan\n\nMLS: Fredy Montero, Romell Quioto\n\nFCD: Brandon Pollard, Jordan Stone, Arturo Alvarez, Eric Avila, Ryan Hollingshead\n\n13 – Mr. Unlucky\n\nA player with the mojo to wear the “unlucky 13″ and get away with it. A player that will throw their arrogance back in the face of fate and tell it to take a hike. Style, flash, brashness, guts, and attitude are hallmarks of the #13.\n\nOften a midfielder and a second 10, if you will, except in Spain where the 13 is required by rule to be a keeper.\n\nWorld: Michael Ballack, Alessandro Nesta, Maicon (w/ Inter), Eusebio (1966 World Cup), Thomas Muller, Gerd Muller, Rafinha\n\nUSA: Cobi Jones, Clint Mathis, Ricardo Clark, Jordan Morris.\n\nFCD: Brian Haynes, Dax McCarty, Tesho Akindele, Zdenek Ondrasek\n\n14 – The Brains\n\nThe fourteen is a class player, most often in the midfield, and usually, one that gets by with brains rather than brawn.\n\nThe 14 number became famous because of Johan Cruyff, the embodiment of total football. He switched to it in 1970, previously he had been 9.\n\nFC Dallas side note: For FCD these players have a lot of grit and heart added in. It’s arguably the most influential number in club history.\n\nWorld: Johan Cruyff, Jose Maria Guti, Thierry Henry (club), Xabi Alonso, Bobby Moffat\n\nMLS: Chris Armas, Ben Olsen, Steve Ralston, Chad Marshall, Alex.\n\nFCD: Leonel Alvarez, Ted Eck, Drew Moor, George John, Atiba Harris\n\nFCD Side Story: This is the number FCD wanted to give to Simo Valakari when he joined the club because of the history of the number. Unfortunately, the soon-to-be-cut Gavin Glinton was wearing #14 and FCD hadn’t reached an injury settlement to clear Glinton off the roster by the time Valakari was added. So instead FCD gave Valakari #17.\n\n15 – Mr. Personality\n\nFor some reason 15 is often a player with a big personality, whether it is ego, toughness, or just general hubris. Not specifically linked to a position on the field.\n\nWorld: Olivier Dacourt, Nemanja Vidić, Lilian Thuram, Mats Hummels, Daniel Sturridge\n\nMLS: John Wolyniec, Jessee Marsch, Roy Lassiter, Thomas McNamara.\n\nFCD: Chad Deering, Mark Wilson, Adrian Serioux, Jacori Hayes\n\n16 & 17 – The Ten + Whatever\n\nNothing particularly sets these numbers apart except that they are often relatively desired numbers in the modern 23-man squad. Often chosen as ten + whatever number the player really wanted or simply as “any number under 20.”\n\nThese two numbers kick off a string of frequent striker numbers up to 20, but they can be used in other places.\n\nIn general terms, I feel like 16 tends slightly toward midfield as 6+10 while 17 tends toward attack as 7+10.\n\nContrary to that, for FC Dallas the 17 has been defensive.\n\nIn France, the 16 is reserved for a keeper.\n\n16 – Sixteen\n\nWorld: Roy Keane, Daniele de Rossi\n\nUSA: Benny Feilhaber\n\nMLS: Josh Wolff, David Estrada\n\nFCD: Alexy Korol, David Wagenfuhr, Bobby Warshaw, Ricardo Pepi\n\n17 – Seventeen\n\nWorld: David Trézéguet, Pedro, Alexis Sanchez, Kevin De Bruyne, Marek Hamsik, Jerome Boateng, Emmanuel Petit\n\nUSA: Juan Agudelo, Jozy Altidore\n\nMLS: Chris Rolfe, Chris Wingert, Will Bruin\n\nFCD: Zarco Rodriguez, Simo Valakari, Aaron Pitchkolan, Zach Loyd, Nkosi Tafari\n\n18 – The Double-9\n\n#18 is usually, but not always, a striker or forward number. Most often chosen as 9+9.\n\nIvan Zamorano when he was with Inter used to put a little “+” between the 1 and the 8 to make 9. It’s also occasionally chosen as 10+8 for a creative or linking midfielder.\n\nAnd in the USA it’s sometimes a keeper’s number. Perhaps because when rosters were at 18 it was the highest number? Or is it all because of Kasey Keller?\n\nField Players\n\nWorld: Jurgen Klinsmann, Paul Scholes, Shaun Wright-Phillips (England), Lionel Messi (early days Argentina), Ivan Zamorano, Jordi Alba, Ashley Young\n\nUSA: Chris Wondolowski, CJ Sapong\n\nMLS: Dom Dwyer\n\nFCD: Richard Farrer, Richard Mulrooney, Toni Nhleko, Brandon Servania\n\nKeepers\n\nUSA: Kasey Keller\n\nMLS: Pat Onstad, Nick Rimando, Jon Busch, Matt Pickens, Chris Seitz (with FCD)\n\n19 – Ten + Nine\n\nSimilar to the 18, the 19 is often chosen as 10+9.\n\nClinton Morrison while at Crystal Palace also put a little + between the 1 and the 9 on his jersey.\n\nWorld: Lionel Messi (early days at Barcelona), Esteban Cambiasso, Mario Götze, Dwight Yorke, Leroy Sane\n\nMLS: Chad Barrett, Dane Richards, Juninho\n\nFCD: Bobby Rhine, Paxton Pomykal\n\nSide Note: At FC Dallas #19 is now a Homegrown only number to honor Bobby, currently worn by Paxton Pomykal.\n\n20 – The Other 9\n\nRather than being thought of as a playmaker wearing 10×2, #20 is most frequently worn by someone who is a prototypical 9.\n\nNo. 20 was made popular as a striker number in 1982 by Paolo Rossi when he led Italy to the World Cup title as he scored six goals to win the Golden Boot and the Golden Ball. Italy handed out numbers from 1 to 22 in order from defender to striker for that tournament so all the forwards in the Italy squad wore 15 and up that year.\n\nWorld: Deco, Paolo Rossi, Gonzalo Higuain (w/ Juve), Vava, Dele Alli, Ole Gunnar Solskjær, Oliver Bierhoff\n\nUSA: Brian McBride\n\nMLS: Brian McBride, Taylor Twellman, Jack McInerney.\n\nFCD: Carlos Ruiz, Brek Shea, Ronald Cerritos, Arial Graziani, Mickey Trotman.\n\n21 – BlackJack\n\nThe odd duck of the first 23 numbers. If you see someone wearing 21 they were usually assigned #21 and then just don’t bother to change. Landon Donovan, for example, only wore it in the US squad until 10 opened up.\n\nWorld: David Silva, Philipp Lahm, Andre Pirlo, Zinedine Zidane (w Juve)\n\nUSA: Landon Donovan (early days), Paul Arriola\n\nMLS: Dema Kovalenko, Shalrie Joseph\n\nFCD: Michael Barrios, Alex Yi, and a bunch of guys who quickly swapped out of it like Greg Vanney or Ramon Nunez\n\n22 – The Lalas\n\nThe double 2, so more often than not a defender. Partially made famous in the states by Alexi Lalas.\n\nIt’s also often a keeper jersey, particularly for FC Dallas.\n\nWorld: Kaka (AC Milan), Dani Alvez, Willian, Isco, Christian Pulisic\n\nUSA: Alexi Lalas\n\nMLS: William Conde, Davy Arnaud, Ramiro Corrales, Marvell Wynne\n\nFCD: Matt Jordan, Chris Snitko, DJ Countess, Josh Lambo\n\n23 – The Beckham, a.k.a Michael Jordan\n\nThe last World Cup squad number prior to the 2022 roster expansion.\n\n#23 was famously chosen by David Beckham when he went to Real Madrid to “honor Michael Jordan.” In reality, #7 at Real was taken by Mr. Madrid himself, Raul. So Beckham had to pick something else and 23 was available. Because of Beckham and Jordan, this is now a very popular number.\n\nTraditionally in the 23-man international squads where it was the “extra” player added beyond 22 (i.e. two complete sets of 11) this number was frequently the 3rd keeper.\n\nWorld: David Beckham (Madrid), Marco Materazzi, Jamie Carragher, Carlo Cudicini, Massimo Oddo, Massimo Ambrosini, Sol Campbell, Arturo Vidal\n\nUSA: Eddie Pope\n\nMLS: David Beckham, Colin Clark, Ezra Hendrickson, Kei Kamara.\n\nFCD: Blake Wagner, Sergi Daniv, Kellyn Acosta, Thomas Roberts\n\nUsage that makes my head hurt: Stop wearing #23 for Beckham, wear the #7 and honor the world game. Beckham wore 23 after he “sold out” to the money and glamour of Madrid and then American hype. When he was a soccer player first – at Man U and with England – he wore 7.\n\nYou want to bend it like Beckham? Then wear 7.\n\nAnd get off my lawn.\n\n24 to 30 – The Large Squad\n\nThere is nothing in and of itself “wrong” with these numbers, they are a byproduct of larger squads over 23 players. In MLS these are primarily developmental squad numbers as the MLS “senior rosters” hold up to 20 players.\n\nOften, these numbers are just handed out as what’s available, they certainly are with FC Dallas where young players don’t usually get to pick their numbers.\n\nAs squads around the world are bigger, and as players move more frequently, these higher numbers are being used more and more. Some of them have become famous both in MLS and around the world. Here are a few.\n\n24 – Matt Hedges at FC Dallas, Tim Howard at Everton.\n\n25 – Brian Ching, Antonio Valencia, Gianfranco Zola, Walker Zimmerman and, Callum Montgomery at FCD.\n\nRequired by rule to be a keeper in Spain.\n\n26 – John Terry. He chose it because it meant he got to sit next to #25 Gianfranco Zola in the locker room. Yes, seriously.\n\n29 – Franco Jara. The Argentine striker requested the 29 the number he wore with Pachuca.\n\n30 – Kyle Zobeck, Ray Burse, Maarten Paes.\n\n30 is required by rule to be a goalkeeper in France. At FC Dallas the number has never been worn by a non-keeper and is usually the 3rd keeper’s kit.\n\n31 and Up – Oddities\n\nThere are the numbers that really stretch the upper limits of rosters. In massive clubs, they are needed, often for youth players or U21s who are called up. In MLS, they aren’t needed so much but they will still see them, much to my annoyance.\n\nIn very recent times I’ve come to believe some players are sometimes picking these numbers just to be odd. Anything above here pretty much makes my head hurt. I’m too old school, I hate numbers that are silly, goofy, funny, odd, or a joke… which describes pretty much anything above this.\n\n31 – George Weah at Chelsea.\n\n32 – David Beckham at AC Milan. The reverse of 23, obviously.\n\n33 – Kenny Cooper.\n\nThis is the NFL number that you see more on kids than professionals. Cooper wore it because the 9 was taken, then his second choice 3 was taken… Cooper said he had previously worn 3 for a large part of his career to pay homage to a friend of his father.\n\n37 – Maxi Urruti. He has worn this number all but one year of his career.\n\n41 – Ted Eck. He swapped to #41 when Leonel Alvarez briefly returned to the Dallas Burn.\n\n42 – Yaya Torre. The reverse of his number at Barcelona (24).\n\nAlso the ultimate answer to the question of life, the universe, and everything.\n\n45 – Mario Balotelli. Inter Milan youth players wore between 36 and 50, he took 45 as 4+5 = 9… then he scored in all four games in which he wore the number… so he kept it for good luck.\n\n44 & 48 – Dario Sala. Dario said he wore #48 to honor his wife’s father who wore it in college. He later switched to the #44 to honor someone else.\n\n66 – Alain Sutter, when he played for Dallas he wore 66 as an homage to America and Route 66.\n\n69 – Bixente Lizarazu\n\n76 – Andriy Shevchenko at AC Milan. A “birth year” number.\n\n77 – Andy Williams, Luka Dončić. When #7 is taken you double down. Lots of versions of this these days. 66, 88.\n\n99 – The Gretzky.\n\nMade famous by NHL legend Wayne Gretzky who chose it when he was a kid because he wanted the #9 to honor Gordie Howe and on his youth team someone already had the 9.\n\nLike Gretzky, most people who wear 99 actually want 9. See Bradley Wright-Phillips or Ronaldo at AC Milan.\n\n0 & 00 – Another Keeper\n\nA keeper number, particularly in the US college system but occasionally even in MLS. These two numbers are very American as it’s a non-traditional world number."
