        "text": "The State of Qatar’s decision to bid for the FIFA World Cup 2022™ was driven by its leaders’ ambition, starting with an idea and a dream.\n\nIn March 2009, Sheikh Mohammed bin Hamad bin Khalifa Al Thani, the Chairman of the Qatar 2022 Bid Committee, submitted Qatar’s final bid to Joseph S. Blatter, the President of FIFA at the time.\n\nIn addition to the State of Qatar, other well-established sporting countries submitted the bid, either jointly, such as Spain-Portugal and Belgium-Netherlands or individually, such as England, Russia, the United States, Mexico, Australia, Japan, Indonesia, South Korea and China.\n\nHamad International Airport Inaugurated\n\nMay 2014 saw one of the biggest early milestones in FIFA World Cup Qatar 2022™ Journey – the opening of Hamad International Airport.\n\nWith international flights commencing and an expected 70 million passengers annually, the question of transport and travel for the tournament had been answered. Undoubtedly, this strategic project was considered one of the most important ones delivered in preparation for the FIFA World Cup Qatar 2022™.\n\nDespite being a new airport, it has won several international awards, the latest of which was the 2022 Skytrax World’s Best Airport Award, which it also won in 2021.\n\nThe Supreme Committee for Delivery & Legacy Begins Community Outreach Tours\n\nThe Supreme Committee for Delivery & Legacy launched its first introductory tour activities for community outreach, as part of the preparations for hosting the FIFA World Cup Qatar 2022™.\n\nThis introductory tour was an opportunity to introduce the tournament and the sustainable legacy it will leave behind for the State of Qatar and the wider region. The tour has also been instrumental in introducing the local community to the various volunteer opportunities organised by the Supreme Committee for Delivery & Legacy, encouraging the local community to be an active partner in the preparation and organisation process of the FIFA World Cup Qatar 2022™.\n\nHis Highness Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad Al Thani, the Amir of the State of Qatar, inaugurated the Khalifa International Stadium on 19 May 2017. Some 12,000 seats were added to the renovated stadium, bringing the total number of seats to 40,000.\n\nThe Khalifa International Stadium was the first stadium to be declared as ready for the FIFA World Cup Qatar 2022™.\n\nThe Khalifa International Stadium dates back to 1976, holding a special place in the hearts of Qataris for the memories associated with it, as the stadium hosted many local and regional football competitions over the years.\n\nStadium 974 Design Revealed\n\nOn 26 November 2017 the Supreme Committee for Delivery & Legacy unveiled the design of the Stadium 974, the seventh venue for the FIFA World Cup Qatar 2022™.\n\nThe stadium is distinguished by its innovative and bold design. Built using shipping containers and detachable materials – including the walls, ceiling, and seats – the stadium brings together a modern design with a distinctive view.\n\nAl Janoub Stadium Inaugurated\n\n16 May 2019 was an exceptional day in the history of the FIFA World Cup Qatar 2022™, as His Highness Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad Al Thani, the Amir of the State of Qatar, inaugurated the Al Janoub Stadium.\n\nThe Al Janoub Stadium was the first stadium to be fully constructed for the FIFA World Cup Qatar 2022™.\n\nAl Thumama Stadium Inaugurated\n\nOn 22 October 2021, the Al Thumama Stadium was inaugurated. Its design was inspired by the gahfiya, a head garment worn by people in the State of Qatar and across the Arabian Gulf region.\n\nOn its opening day, the stadium hosted the Amir Cup final between Al Sadd and Al Rayyan.\n\nAl Thumama Stadium is located 12 km south of downtown Doha and is close to Hamad International Airport. The stadium’s design, which blends together the past and the present, celebrates decades of rich Arab culture passed from generation to generation in Qatar and across the region.\n\nDesigned by Qatari architect Ibrahim Jaidah, the stadium won the prestigious MIPIM Architectural Review Future Projects Awards in May 2018."
