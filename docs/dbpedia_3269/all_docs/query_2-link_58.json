        "text": "Australian Boomers icon Patty Mills is expected to retire from international competition following their elimination from the 2024 Paris Olympics. The Aussies suffered a heartbreaking 95-90 overtime loss to Serbia in the quarterfinals on Tuesday, August 6, at the Accor Arena in Paris. This defeat ended their medal hopes despite being one of the favorites to reach the podium with their NBA-laden roster. Australia had a bronze medal finish in the last Summer Games in Tokyo 2020 (held in 2021).\n\nAustralian Boomers Legend Expected to Retire After Olympic Elimination\n\nAustralia’s starting point guard Patty Mills, who has represented the senior national team since the 2007 FIBA Oceania Championship, likely played his final game for the country, according to ESPN Australia’s Olgun Uluc. The 35-year-old veteran certainly made his final appearance on the international stage memorable. Mills nailed a tough off-balance midrange jumper to tie the game at 82 apiece and send it to overtime with 1.4 seconds left in regulation.\n\nMills finished the contest with 26 points on 11-of-21 shooting, adding three rebounds and two steals. Despite his efforts, Australia blew a 24-point lead against Serbia, leading to the largest comeback in Olympic history. The Canberra native still spoke positively about the team despite their disappointing finish in Paris.\n\n“We just enjoy every moment of this journey. Hasn’t been the smoothest sailing ship, but we do it together and never take those moments for granted. Through the thick and thin, ups and downs, the happy tears, the sad tears. It’s been an incredible journey to be able to share with those guys.”\n\nAustralia’s roster was filled with NBA talent, including Mills, Josh Giddey, Josh Green, Dante Exum, Jock Landale, Duop Reath, Dyson Daniels, and Joe Ingles. Former Cleveland Cavaliers guard Matthew Dellavedova, who now plays in the NBL, was also part of the team. The team even left out Portland Trail Blazers guard and defensive specialist Matisse Thybulle. The 27-year-old was a member of their bronze medal-winning squad in Tokyo.\n\nIn addition to Mills, Ingles is also expected to retire from the national team. The two have represented Australia in the last five Olympic Games since 2008 in Beijing. Australia head coach Brian Goorjian also coached his last game in his second stint with the national team which began in 2020. The 71-year-old previously coached them from 2001 to 2009.\n\nPatty Mills Is Still A Free Agent\n\nMills remains an unrestricted free agent in the NBA. He last played for the Miami Heat in the latter part of the 2023-24 season. The 6-foot guard inked a contract in March 2024 for the remainder of the campaign. He appeared in 32 regular season and four playoff games under Erik Spoelstra.\n\nThe former Saint Mary’s Gaels player started the season with the Atlanta Hawks, following multiple trades during the 2023 offseason from his previous team, the Brooklyn Nets. The Nets initially traded Mills to the Houston Rockets, who then dealt him to the Oklahoma City Thunder before ultimately landing with Atlanta. The Hawks waived him at the end of February, which led to his move to Miami.\n\nMills recently won the 2022 NBA Sportsmanship Award while with the Nets. He is best known for his lengthy tenure with the San Antonio Spurs from 2012 to 2021. Under head coach Gregg Popovich, Mills was a crucial contributor off the bench during the Spurs’ 2014 NBA Championship run."
