        "text": "Medal table | Olympic schedule |How to watch | Olympic news\n\nLYON, France — Sophia Smith rescued the U.S. women’s national team from a second straight Olympic soccer slog here on Tuesday, and sent the Americans to their first gold-medal final since 2012.\n\nIn another arduous knockout match, after another scoreless 90 minutes, another superstar attacker broke open a locked game in extra time.\n\nThree days earlier, it was Trinity Rodman. Here at the Groupama Stadium, in a semifinal against Germany, it was Smith, another young attacker who has \"just f***ing gone on another level in this tournament,\" as head coach Emma Hayes said postgame.\n\nSmith sped and scrapped past a German defender in the 95th minute, and scored the only goal of a 1-0 victory.\n\nBut at the final whistle, she was not the one to whom teammates ran, indebted. They beelined for goalkeeper Alyssa Naeher, who in the 119th minute, preserved the victory with a flying kick save of a header from point-blank range.\n\nAnd they all embraced, utterly drained, but triumphant.\n\n\"I'm really proud of our ability to just hang in,\" Hayes said, \"even though it was tough.\"\n\nNine days earlier, the USWNT had raced past this same German side. They bolted into the knockout rounds, looking like a team transformed. Their dreary quarterfinal against Japan, though, reminded all involved that knockout soccer is a different animal; and that this semifinal might also be a tactical, physical battle.\n\nAnd for the better part of 90 minutes, it turned into exactly that. Germany wasn’t quite as conservative as Japan had been. But, after a few bright moments in the opening 15 minutes — Rodman created the best chance of the first half for Rose Lavelle — this group-stage rematch reverted to drudgery.\n\nThere were slight swings, modest surges. There were dangerous set pieces at both ends. But every save that Naeher and Ann-Katrin Berger, the two goalkeepers, had to make was routine.\n\nDefensively, the U.S. was sound. Naomi Girma, in yet another big game at yet another major tournament, was imperious. She stone-walled German attackers one-on-one; she read and intercepted through-balls; she cut out crosses.\n\nThe Germans charged into the second half, and suddenly looked like the better team. But they couldn’t find a way past Girma, the best player on the field by far.\n\n\"She's insane,\" Smith said. \"She's the best defender in the world. No one can get past her. She's the glue to our team.\"\n\nHayes went a step further: \"Look, she's the best defender I've ever seen. Ever.\"\n\nThe game, though, one year to the day since the USWNT lost a heartbreaker to Sweden at the Women’s World Cup, began to feel a lot like that infamous night in Melbourne, Australia. The Americans were eager; they were up for a challenge; but they struggled to create many (or any) high-quality chances.\n\nTired legs — the product of five games in 13 days and little lineup rotation — over-hit passes in the final third.\n\nThe game became stretched, but exhausted players couldn’t exploit increasingly open spaces.\n\nA few went down, clutching for cramping muscles.\n\nAnd a second consecutive do-or-die grind — for both teams — headed to extra time at 0-0, and looked destined for penalties.\n\nBut that’s where this story diverged from last summer’s. When asked Saturday whether the Sweden game — in which Smith missed a critical penalty — was on her mind as a similar conclusion loomed, Smith said: “We're moved on from the World Cup.”\n\nThen she proved it.\n\nThe decisive three-pass move started from Girma, and it was excellent. Sam Coffey nestled into a pocket in her midfield pivot position, received the ball on the turn, and played a pass into the feet of Mallory Swanson, who’d popped into another pocket of space further up the field. Swanson’s through-ball was read by German fullback Feli Rauch. But Smith, who had been alarmingly quiet in the second half, chased it down, and guided the ball into the far corner of the net — just as her teammates knew she would.\n\n\"Of course,\" Swanson said.\n\n\"A hundred percent,\" Hayes said.\n\nSmith, for a second or two, smiled and screamed in celebration. \"Just a lot of relief, happiness,\" she later recalled. Then she simply fell to the ground, because: \"F***, we still have to play so much longer.\"\n\nThey had to hang on. But they survived the German aerial assault, thanks to Naeher. And they advanced to Saturday's final, where they'll play Brazil."
