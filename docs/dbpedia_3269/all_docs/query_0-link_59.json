        "text": "In fact it seems like the only problem with this wonderful Christian brother, is that he isn‚Äôt willing to switch clubs to Real Madrid..! :-)‚Äù\n\nToday, that ‚Äúonly problem‚Äù has been solved, since Kak√° is now a Real Madrid player!! This wonderful football player and ambassador of Christ is now the latest star to join my childhood love of Real Madrid üôÇ\n\nKak√°, who just dazzled the world again during the Confederations Cup where he lead Brazil to victory and was selected as the best player of the tournament, will now be even more in the spotlight than he was used to when he was playing for A.C. Milan. A.C. Milan is a large club, but nowhere near the status and size of Real Madrid.\n\nIt‚Äôs great that one of the top three footballers in the world these days (the other two being Real Madrid‚Äôs Portuguese, Cristiano Ronaldo, and Barcelona‚Äôs Argentine, Lionel Messi) is so open about his relationship with Jesus Christ. It‚Äôs beautiful that he makes such an impact on and off the field that people can‚Äôt talk about Kak√° without talking about his faith in Jesus Christ as well. I remember seeing a football magazine in Ukraine with a picture of Kak√° on the cover and the heading said what Kak√°‚Äôs t-shirts always say: ‚ÄúI Belong To Jesus‚Äú. It‚Äôs great that Kak√° helps spread the message of life in Jesus Christ this way to millions of people all over the world who wouldn‚Äôt normally be interested in ‚Äúreligion‚Äù\n\nIt was interesting to see how the Danish newspaper Politiken just yesterday was desperately trying to discredit Kak√°, team captain L√∫cio and the other believers on the Brazilian national team (see picture above) by trying to make it sound as if they‚Äôre part of some mysterious sect as opposed to just being great men who are madly in love with the only Savior and hope of the world, Jesus Christ! The fact that Kak√°‚Äôs favorite book is the Bible, and that he was a virgin when he married his teenhood sweetheart, Caroline, has always been a thorn in the side of the secular sports media all over the world, but the fact is that it stands as a beautiful testimony of a man fully dedicated to his savior and best friend, Jesus Christ in a world of sports where selfishness, stupidity and sex is what normally sells‚Ä¶.\n\nI am looking forward to watching Kak√° strut his stuff in the beautiful white jersey, and I will continue to remember to pray for him to stay strong in Christ and not give into the temptations of this world. There is nothing Satan and the secular media would enjoy more than to see Kak√° fall one way or another. I am thankful, though, that the one who is in Kak√° is stronger than the one, Satan, who is in this world (1. John 4:4)!!\n\nTorben ‚Äì who is hoping to get a Real Madrid Kak√°-jersey for Christmas üôÇ"
