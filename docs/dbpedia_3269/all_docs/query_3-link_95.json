        "text": "FINAL: Riverhounds SC 0, Detroit City FC 0\n\nUSL Match Center / Game Stats\n\nQuality chances were hard to come by in a match pitting two of the strongest defensive sides in the USL Championship, as the Pittsburgh Riverhounds SC battled host Detroit City FC to a scoreless stalemate at Keyworth Stadium in Hamtramck, MI, on Wednesday night.\n\nWith this result, the Hounds (26 points) remain four points behind City FC (30 points) and extend their unbeaten streak to five matches (3-0-2). Goalkeeper Eric Dick made two saves in recording his eight clean sheet of the season.\n\n“At the end of the game, we pushed. We had a better second half. We had a good start, but they started to push the gaps, so we were lucky on a few occasions in the first half,” Riverhounds SC Head Coach Bob Lilley said after the match.\n\nIn each of the past three seasons since the two clubs began playing in 2022, they’ve now played to a draw at Keyworth Stadium, with the last two times neither side able to break through with a goal.\n\nAt the start of the match, the Hounds were solidly organized in a 5-3-2 shape, but could not muster a single shot in the first half, though they played direct quite a bit (38 long passes in first half) and looked to attack from the width, sending 11 crosses, while also forcing Detroit into a dozen clearances.\n\nWith home crowd behind them, Detroit City FC put forth a more inspired first half performance, including the only shot on frame in the first 45 minutes, but Hounds goalkeeper Eric Dick’s quick reaction denied Elvis Amoh’s close range chance.\n\nDick came up big when he needed to, unlike the previous match when had to make eight saves, the Hounds kept Detroit at distance for most of the match.\n\n“I wasn’t as busy because the guys in front of me were shutting things down and working their butts off,” Dick said.\n\n“My role is to move the pieces in front of me. Maybe I don’t touch the ball as much, but when it does come my way, I have to be locked in, and ready to go.”\n\nPittsburgh’s attack started to come to life in the second half. Early on Bradley Sample’s effort was blocked, then in the 57th minute, EJ Johnson’s chance from distance sailed left.\n\nPittsburgh’s first shot on frame came on a Kenardo Forbes free kick in the 63rd minute, that also resulted in a scrum in front of goal, with Hounds’ defender Pat Hogan getting issued a yellow card.\n\nIn the dying moments of the match the Hounds brought more pressure, as they would finish the half (and the match) with nine total shots.\n\nOne corner chance for the Hounds in the 93rd minute fell to the feet of midfielder Jackson Walti, who attempted to hit a volley that sailed across goal, where Suber wasn’t quick enough to react to turn it on frame.\n\nKeeping legs fresh in a week when they’re playing three matches in eight days, Pittsburgh used all five allotted substitutions, as Kazaiah Sterling and Langston Blackstock came on in the 64th minute, then Robbie Mertz and Jackson Walti joined on in the 80th minute. Babacar Diene was the final sub, entering in the 89th minute.\n\nDespite the squad rotation, the Hounds couldn’t get over the hump in matches at Keyworth Stadium, but the defensive effort, the team’s second straight road shutout, is certainly something to build upon for a group needing to finish the season strong to have any chance at earning a trip to the postseason.\n\n“We have a good energy, we’re hungry,” Dick added.\n\n“This time of year, we need all that. We need to be hungry. We’re not trying to look too far ahead. Every game is a different game. This group has a good energy going forward.”\n\nWhile the Hounds couldn’t get closer to Detroit, they did inch forward a point.\n\nWith 11 matches to go, they’ll take any bit of forward progress.\n\n“Look, I’m proud of the guys. We talk a lot about creating more chances, making the keeper work more, but Detroit’s a tough team to break down,” Lilley said.\n\n“It’s not what we were after, but we’ll take the point.”\n\nhttps://twitter.com/RiverhoundsSC/status/1821359324997746931/video/1\n\nNext Up:\n\nThe Riverhounds will return home to face San Antonio FC, at Highmark Stadium on Saturday night (7 p.m. kickoff).\n\nLatest Look at Eastern Conference Playoff Line"
