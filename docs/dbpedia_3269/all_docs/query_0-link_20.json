        "text": "So will the FIFA Under-20 World Cup 2009 round off to the sound of the samba beat? Or to the din of the African drum? Matters in Egypt come to a head this Friday evening, when two of the pre-tournament favourites go head-to-head for the crown and the glory. It is the Satellites against the Sele√ß√£o, the champions of Africa against the champions of South America. It is Ghana vs Brazil.\n\nFor a tournament of so many shocks, it is in a way comforting to see two of the big guns make it to the final. Ghana and Brazil were tipped by many to go far in this competition, and while the likes of Spain, Nigeria and Czech Republic faltered meekly early on, these two have stayed the course all the way to the end. Now, in a repeat of the 1993 final, we will find out which big dog has the sharpest teeth.\n\nPlayers to watch\n\nThe beauty of this year‚Äôs Ghana vs Brazil final is in the cast. A large number of the competition‚Äôs brightest stars will be on display on Friday, and that should hopefully make for an entertaining game ‚Äì (after Uruguay vs Argentina I‚Äôm not overhyping anything!). Both teams have exciting players all over the pitch; Ghana have the grace of Ransford Osei, the dominant, ruthless forward play of runaway top scorer Dominic Adiyiah and the dynamism of Andre Ayew, who was disappointing and substituted in the semi final but will surely lead his team out as captain for the final.\n\nThese gifted forward players are supported by explosive full-backs David Addy and Samuel Inkoom, arguably the tournament‚Äôs best right back and provider of numerous assists. Emmanuel Agyemang-Badu is another player I like ‚Äì a tough but calm holding midfielder who puts in the tackles and keeps the game flowing. It is no surprise that Juventus have scouted him heavily during the competition.\n\nBrazil are also not without talent. Alex Teixeira may be the name on everyone‚Äôs lips but others have shone too. Alan Kardec‚Äôs superb half-volley to win the semi-final against Costa Rica was the high point of an impressive tournament for the youngster. The number 10 Giuliano has captained the team with authority and played with the type of flair his shirt number deserves. And Douglas Costa has also offered tantalising glimpses of his dazzling abilities. If you‚Äôre looking to spot the next generation of great players you‚Äôd be well advised to watch this final.\n\nGoing for goals\n\nGhana and Brazil have scored 30 goals between them out in Egypt so far, The Black Satellites leading the way as tournament top scorers with 16, and with Ghana‚Äôs defence still not wholly convincing I‚Äôd expect there to be goals here. Though Ghana coach Sellas Tetteh‚Äôs side were cruising at half time against Hungary in the semis, they still looked desperately exposed at the back in the second half allowing Hungary to score two soft goals, and it could have been worse still. The Hungarians created a string of chances to nearly rescue what looked a hopeless situation at the break, and this will worry Tetteh ahead of the final.\n\nFriday‚Äôs game will be the fourth time Ghana have played Brazil in a major final at youth level. The score is 2-1 to Brazil right now; they won the 1993 U-20 World Cup final and the 1997 U-17 World Cup final (inspired by a fresh-faced kid going by the name of Ronaldinho). Ghana‚Äôs own triumph came courtesy of a 3-2 win in the 1995 U-17 World Cup final. Can the Black Satellites make it 2-2 in the series on Friday?\n\nIf they do, they will become the first African team to ever win this competition having already lost two finals (in 1993 and 2001). ‚ÄúWe‚Äôll do whatever it takes to win the trophy now,‚Äù Sellas Tetteh told FIFA. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre favourites and we‚Äôre up for the challenge. We‚Äôve played good football throughout the tournament. We have no reason to be nervous. We have the required fitness, and we have the necessary determination.‚Äù\n\nNice words, but will Ghana be fearless enough to stand up to the famous Brazil, who I stated earlier in the tournament seem to have the power to overwhelm teams through name alone?\n\nAfter all, this is no great shakes for the Sele√ß√£o. They‚Äôve been here six times before and won it on four occasions (1983, 1985, 1993, 2003).\n\nSo who will come out on top in Cairo? Will Adiyiah add(iyiah) to his extraordinary goal tally and fire the Satellites to their maiden crown? Or is it still all about Brazil? Find out on Friday, kick-off 20.00 local time or 19.00 in the UK.\n\nAlso, don‚Äôt forget to check back on Just-Football.com when it‚Äôs all over (or you could just subscribe üòâ), when we will be taking a look back at some of the best young players of the tournament."
