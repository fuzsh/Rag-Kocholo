        "text": "In the Sugar Bowl, quarterback Michael Penix Jr. led the Huskies to a dramatic 37-21 victory over Texas, holding off a late Texas comeback. The victory advanced the Huskies to the national championship game versus Michigan.\n\nThe Wolverines won the Rose Bowl game against Alabama to secure a position in the final Division I game of the season, and on January 8, the two teams left in the CFP will square off in Houston.\n\nGiven that Steve Sarkisian started his head coaching career at Washington in 2009, turning around a 0-12 squad and going 34-29 before departing in 2014 to take a position at USC, where he was dismissed in his second season (2015), Monday night's game was particularly difficult for the Texas head coach.\n\nFour minutes into the first quarter, Washington running back Dillon Johnson scored a two-yard rushing touchdown, giving the Huskies their first points in New Orleans. The extra point was then successfully converted by kicker Grady Gross, his first of seven attempts.\n\nBut the Longhorns, spurred on by former player Matthew McConaughey and Texas Governor Gregg Abbott, responded right immediately when running back Jaydon Blue scored a 5-yard touchdown to tie the game at 7 points. In 3:55 minutes, seven plays and 75 yards were required before the Longhorns were able to get a point. Bert Auburn, the kicker, made sure the first of the three extra points was converted.\n\nTwo minutes into the second quarter, Washington took a 14-7 lead thanks to Johnson's second touchdown of the game. However, the Longhorns tied the score in the first half when Texas lineman Byron Murphy II took a handoff and burst through the goal line for a one-yard touchdown.\n\nThen, with 1:27 remaining before the half, Penix hit wide receiver Ja'Lynn Polk for his first score of the game, a 29-yard pass. After two quarters, both teams shared honours as C.J. Baxter raced for a 3-yard touchdown run, giving the Huskies the illusion that they would go into halftime ahead.\n\nFour and a half minutes into the third quarter, wide receiver Jalen McMillan of Washington took the lead on a 19-yard pass from Penix. Gross scored the extra point, his fourth of the game, and the Huskies had some breathing room after a Texas turnover. However, they were unable to capitalise and were only able to get a field goal to extend their advantage to 31-21.\n\nDespite having the ball for the first time in the final fifteen minutes of the fourth quarter, Washington was unable to convert on their first third down, and Gross' 40-yard field goal increased the lead by two touchdowns (34-21).\n\nAfter eventually scoring his first touchdown of the game, a yard throw to Adonai Mitchell from Texas quarterback Quinn Ewers, Auburn completed the extra point to cut Washington's lead to 34-28 with 7:23 remaining in the game.\n\nWith 2:40 remaining, Washington increased their advantage by three points to 37-28 as Gross made a 27-yard field goal. Texas pulled within one touchdown with 1:09 remaining thanks to a 25-yard field goal from Auburn.\n\nWith 15 seconds remaining, Ewers and the rest of the Longhorns offence reached Washington's 12-yard line and had four chances at the end zone in a wild finish to end the second CFP semifinal of the evening. However, Ewers failed on the final three. The last pass was a long, fade to an Adonai Mitchell who was well-covered.\n\nEwers passed for 318 yards and a score in Texas' football team's final Big 12 game before moving to the Southeastern Conference, the team's first-ever CFP appearance. However, it was insufficient to overcome Penix and his wide range of gifted receivers.\n\nUp Next:"
