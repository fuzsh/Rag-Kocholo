Midway through the final quarter, Halligan scored her second goal to help Australia secure a 7-4 cushion.\n\nTwo women's water polo semifinal contests, set for this Thursday, will feature the Netherlands versus Spain (5:35 a.m. PT) and Australia versus the United States (10:35 a.m. PT).\n\nMen's Basketball\n\nFormer UCLA standout Jrue Holiday (2009) scored nine points and totaled three assists and two blocks as the U.S. men's basketball team cruised past Brazil, 122-87, in a quarterfinal contest on Tuesday evening in Paris.
