        "text": "Yesterday's Chelsea-Wigan match in the Premier League was remarkable, but not for the 6-0 scoreline, another heavy concession by Wigan or Didier Drogba's hat-trick of assists. It was remarkable for the fact that there were no corner kicks taken. According to Opta Sports, this is the first time this has happened since the company started collecting in-match corner data in the 2003-04 season.\n\nI am absolutely fascinated by that statistic. When you think of all the actions that would typically cause a ball to be played by the defending team over the end line, whether a deflected shot or pass by a defender, a deflection by a goalkeeper, I find it amazing that none of those actions occurred in this game. It will be a very long time before we see a similar statistic again.\n\nA back-of-the-envelope calculation of the probability of such an event would be a fun exercise, but I have more things to occupy my time right now."
