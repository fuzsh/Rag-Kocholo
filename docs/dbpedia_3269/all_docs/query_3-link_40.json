Corinthians vs Gremio - live score, predicted lineups and\n\nThe only team known to have had so few shots in a Champions League semi-final are Inter - famously defending a lead against Barcelona in 2010. Thankfully the owners came back. I am really grateful to them. We can all make mistakes in life but they were big enough to come back and get me. I was really close to another Premier League job at that time. But when West Ham came in and wanted me back, I thought 'no, I am having a go at that'. But the job I was given to keep the club up was even tougher than the first time. I feared it was going to be too difficult. Thankfully, we got through it.

The travelling Toon Army were in fine voice throughout and there is clearly understandable optimism around Tyneside but this must be tempered by the realism that there is no quick fix or easy route to what they hope will be their final destination. The win lifts the Old Lady within a point of Napoli in third and if Roma fail to win today their place in next season's Champions League will be rubber stamped. Venezia remain six points from safety with just four games remaining. Everyone in Dortmund is really excited about Moukoko because he has everything you need to be a successful striker. The midfield was so deep there was no support for the forwards when they had the ball, left with the job of taking on the whole of the PSG defence by themselves.

I thought he should have got more of the ball. Pritchard was the pivot on which most of the Wearsiders' best work materialised, dropping deep to link midfield and attack, while Patrick Roberts, Jack Clarke and Lynden Gooch provided width to keep the game stretched. results, fixtures, Gremio - Corinthians live Gremio scores and fixtures - follow Gremio livescore, results, fixtures and match details on Livesport.com.

Haaland joined Dortmund in December 2019 and committed to a four-and-a-half-year contract with the Bundesliga giants. Liverpool's medical team will speak to their Senegal counterparts about Mane's condition, though it is normal to have regular contact with all international squads, particularly when a player goes off injured. The 24-year-old registered two key passes and completed as many dribbles in normal time as well as two interceptions to break up Egypt's play. The fundamental things you need to do to win a game of football are first and second balls, be ready for a press, show quality in possession and we didn't show any of those qualities from the first minute to the 45th, 46th minute. When you are successful it sometimes has a knock-on negative effect that way, but I am glad I have people looking at my players rather than nobody interested at all. Saints target 'phenomenal' Celtic win St Johnstone head to Hampden Park on Saturday to face Celtic in the League Cup semi-finals. It doesn't work like that, because if you have an argument, the next thing you think is: 'Ah, I've had enough, I'm only doing it for you,' and the next thing you know you're going out to find a drink, that destructive behaviour you were doing in the first place.

Brighton have hit a bit of form after that long run of draws or defeats they were on before Christmas. Gerrard is doing really well as a manager and everyone is putting two and two together and saying that, if he carries on like this, he will be Liverpool's next manager. He quite possibly will but he always plays that down, which I think is good, because he is fully focused on the job he is in. Thomas Partey is a good player and they have missed him - he should make a difference when he's back - but up front they do not get the ball out wide to the wingers. United's pressing tactics were criticised heavily in the wake of the dismal 5-0 home defeat by Liverpool in October, and the stats also suggest Solskjaer's side were lacking in this regard.
