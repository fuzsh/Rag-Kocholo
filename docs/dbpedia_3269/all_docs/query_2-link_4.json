At this moment he isn’t part of it,” Dunga said at the Brazilian Football Confederation (CBF) headquarters after naming his team.\n\nRobinho in\n\nRobinho, who joined former club Santos on a six-month loan deal from English side Manchester City last month, has been included in the squad.\n\nThe match at Arsenal’s Emirates stadium will be Brazil’s first of the year after an impressive 2009 during which they finished top of the South American World Cup qualifying group and won the Confederations Cup.\n\nFive-time champions Brazil were drawn alongside Portugal, Ivory Coast and North Korea in World Cup Group G.\n\nThey begin their campaign against North Korea in Johannesburg on June 15.\n\nSquad:\n\nGoalkeepers: Julio Cesar (Inter Milan), Doni (AS Roma)\n\nDefenders: Maicon (Inter Milan), Daniel Alves (Barcelona), Gilberto (Cruzeiro), Michel Bastos (Olympique Lyon), Lucio (Inter Milan), Luisao (Benfica), Juan (AS Roma), Thiago Silva (AC Milan)\n\nMidfielders: Elano (Galatasaray), Felipe Melo (Juventus), Gilberto Silva (Panathinaikos), Josue (VfL Wolfsburg), Julio Baptista (AS Roma), Kaka (Real Madrid), Kleberson (Flamengo), Ramires (Benfica)\n\nForwards: Luis Fabiano (Sevilla), Robinho (Santos), Adriano (Flamengo), Nilmar (Villarreal)"
