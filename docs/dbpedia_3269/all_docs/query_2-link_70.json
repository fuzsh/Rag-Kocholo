        "text": "Gareth Southgate and Kieran Trippier faced the press ahead of England's match with Iceland at St James' Park on Monday.\n\nSouthgate confirmed that Trippier will captain the team, with both answering several other questions.\n\nHere's what they had to say.\n\nSouthgate on the fitness of Luke Shaw, Harry Maguire and Anthony Gordon…\n\n\"All are progressing well so we're pleased with that. None of them will be involved tomorrow, same tomorrow for Bukayo Saka and for John Stones. Everybody else will be involved. John reported late. Bukayo is fine but we've decided he will rest tomorrow and he should be available for Friday. Anthony has a good chance for Friday, the other two that's a bit more unlikely but we'll see how they go.\"\n\nSouthgate on Jude Bellingham winning the Champions League…\n\n\"He's had a fantastic season. To join the biggest club in the world and perform the way he has throughout this season has been an incredible year for him. You saw him with his family, they have to take enormous credit. That's the way he is. He is authentic and has humility and understanding. He will be off this week because we want him fresh. We try to think about the individual. He's super professional so he's going to tick over but for us we didn't need to see him before next Saturday.\"\n\nSouthgate on the familiar faces in defence…\n\n\"It's testament to their consistency. They've all been playing at top clubs and have delivered in the biggest matches under the most intense pressure. There is a bit of a bond between that group that you get on those big nights. They've had to dig in and come through those challenges. Their pride, their drive, their determination to win has given us a platform in the seven years we've been in charge.\"\n\nSouthgate on what he wants from these two games…\n\n\"There's a reality with the constraints we've got in that four or five guys aren't with us yet. Some players need minutes, some players are short, the whole group that's been with us have had a couple of weeks without a game so everyone will benefit. There's a physical aspect we're looking at and then an opportunity to see some combinations, see players in different positions, some with fewer caps than others playing in what will be a brilliant atmosphere. Lots of objectives and I think the boys will play well. They've come with a top mentality.\"\n\nSouthgate on whether uncapped players will be involved…\n\n\"That will be varying. We're not in a process of just giving caps, we're preparing for a tournament. There are some things we'd like to see and we're happy with how they've trained. The week already has thrown up some brilliant experiences for them. Some will be involved tomorrow, some might not, some might travel to Germany, some might not. I can’t be definitive on that yet.\"\n\nTrippier on captaining the team tomorrow…\n\n\"It's going to be very special in the stadium I play in every week. I have to thank Gareth for giving me that trust. If I have the armband or not, if I play or not, I'm a leader. That's the type of character I am. My son will be mascot so that's even more special. It'll be a very proud moment for me.\"\n\nTrippier on his own fitness…\n\n\"My calf's feeling great. Obviously it was disappointing to pick up that injury but I've worked extremely hard in my rehab to get myself ready. My fitness is fine and I'm ready to go. All the lads have had a good week's training, they're all ready.\"\n\nTrippier on Bellingham…\n\n\"It doesn't seem like he's a 20-year-old. He's so mature and it comes with pressure at Real Madrid. All the boys are delighted for him. Hopefully he can bring that form with England.\"\n\nTrippier on the expectation ahead of EURO 2024…\n\n\"We shouldn't be shy to say we can win it. We've got a great squad, top manager, top staff, we've been so close recently and it's about taking the next step. I fully believe we can go all the way but we need to earn the right. The most important thing is the togetherness in this squad, it's unbelievable. Gareth has created a culture and we all know what it means to play for England.\""
