        "text": "G20 stands for \"Group of Twenty\". The G20 brings together the countries with the largest economies in the world. The member states meet annually to discuss economic, political and social initiatives. The group defines itself as the main forum for international economic cooperation (agreement reached by the leaders at the Pittsburgh Summit in September 2009).\n\nThe G20 Summit is a meeting between the Heads of State or Government of member countries. The term \"Summit\" comes from its English definition and refers to the highest point of a mountain. The Summit is therefore the culmination of more than hundred G20 meetings over the course of a year.\n\nThe G20 Leadersâ€™ Summit was established in response to the global financial crisis that occurred in the wake of the collapse of the Lehman Brothers bank. The existing G20 Meeting of Finance Ministers and Central Bank Governors was upgraded to the head of state level, and the inaugural G20 Summit was held in Washington D.C. in November 2008. From thereon, Summit meetings were held semiannually until 2010 and annually from 2011 onwards."
