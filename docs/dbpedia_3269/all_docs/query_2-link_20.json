        "text": "[UPDATE: Prosecutors in Spain withdrew fraud and corruption charges against Neymar on Oct. 28 after deciding the case was a civil matter, not a criminal one.]\n\nSÃO PAULO, Brazil — Delcir Sonda still remembers the moment he first saw the boy. Years before he would grow up to become one of the biggest stars in the biggest sport in the world, years before anyone outside of his local community in São Vicente — a dormitory town for the nearby port of Santos — had heard his name, Sonda noticed Neymar playing soccer in a cage.\n\nIt was a chance encounter. Sonda was boating with some friends one Sunday afternoon in the mid-2000s when he spotted a group of boys playing on a hard surface inside a fenced enclosure. Intrigued, he asked his friends to stop so he could take a closer look.\n\n“There was one kid there that was just totally different to the others,” Sonda said of Neymar, who would have been 11 or 12 years old at the time. “He got stuck in my head. I never imagined that this kid would one day become my player.”"
