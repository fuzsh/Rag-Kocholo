        "text": "PARIS (AP) — The Paris Olympics will soon come to a close.\n\nU.S. gymnastics star Simone Biles made a triumphant return, taking her Olympic gold tally to seven. French swimmer Léon Marchand won five medals — four of them gold — fulfilling comparisons to Michael Phelps. Armand “Mondo” Duplantis won another gold medal, but the real show for the 80,000 at the Stade de France — which will be the site of Sunday’s closing ceremony — was when he broke the world record for the ninth time.\n\nThere’s been controversy, too. Boxer Imane Khelif of Algeria has been in the spotlight because of misconceptions about her gender.\n\nOrganizers of the Paris Games have, for the most part, successfully showcased the beauty of the French capital. Beach volleyball has taken place next to the Eiffel Tower. Holding events in the polluted Seine River, however, has proven more difficult.\n\nWho is winning the 2024 Olympics?\n\nThe United States leads the medal standings, with China next in line. Australia, France and Britain are vying for the third spot. Here is Wednesday’s Olympic schedule of events, as well as the overall list of medal winners.\n\nWhat’s the last event of the 2024 Olympics?\n\nThe women’s basketball gold medal game is the last event before the closing ceremony. It’s scheduled to tip off at 3:30 p.m. CEST (9:30 a.m. EDT) at Bercy Arena.\n\nWhen is the 2024 Olympics closing ceremony?\n\nThe closing ceremony is scheduled to begin at 9 p.m. CEST (3 p.m. EDT) on Sunday at Stade de France just north of Paris. It’s expected to last until 11:15 p.m. CEST (5:15 p.m. EDT).\n\nWhat will happen during the closing ceremony?\n\nIt will feature traditional highlights, including the athletes’ parade and the handover of the Olympic flag to the organizers of the 2028 Los Angeles Games. There will be a medal presentation ceremony — for the women’s marathon from earlier in the day.\n\nIt’s a more traditional setting after the Seine River was used for the audacious opening ceremony, but don’t expect it to be dull. It features the same artistic director — Thomas Jolly.\n\nOrganizers said in a recent statement that it will include “over a hundred performers, acrobats, dancers and circus artists.” There will be musical performances and “the participation of world-renowned singers will complete the picture. … Part of the show will take place in the air, while the giant sets, costumes and spectacular lighting effects will take spectators on a journey through time, both past and future.”\n\nJolly added: “It’s a very visual, very choreographic, very acrobatic show with an operatic dimension to give a great visual fresco and say goodbye to athletes from all over the world.”\n\nHow can I watch the closing ceremony?\n\nIt will air on NBC and Peacock."
