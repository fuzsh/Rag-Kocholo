While the ICD ninth revision codes for AHI have been validated in the U.S., there have been no studies on the validity of ICD-10 codes for AHI in Canada. The objective of this study was to assess the validity of an ICD-10 coding algorithm for ED encounters for AHI. We conducted a retrospective cohort study of children and adults who had ED encounters at two large academic, tertiary hospitals in London, Canada, between May and September 2014–2018. We developed an algorithm of ICD-10 codes for AHI based upon a literature review and clinical expertise. Our “gold-standard” definition of AHI was patient-reported heat exposure and documentation of at least one heat-related complaint. To establish positive predictive value (PPV), we reviewed 62 algorithm-positive records and noted which met our “gold-standard” definition. To calculate negative predictive value (NPV), sensitivity (Sn), and specificity (Sp), we randomly reviewed 964 ED records for associated ICD-10 codes and diagnoses. Two independent reviewers completed blinded data abstraction, with duplicate abstraction in 20% of the sample. Of the 62 algorithm-positive records, mean (SD) age was 38.8 (23.8) years; 37% were female. PPV was 61.3 ± 12.1% (95% CI). Of the 964 randomly selected records, mean (SD) age was 41.7 (26.5) years; 51.1% were female. The NPV was 99.7 ± 0.4%, sensitivity 25.0 ± 42.4%, and specificity 100.0 ± 0.0%. An ICD-10 coding algorithm for AHI had high specificity but was limited in sensitivity. This algorithm can be used to assemble and study cohorts of patients who have had an AHI, but may underestimate the true incidence of AHI presentations in the ED.

Early care and education (ECE) providers faced reduced income, increased debt, and material hardships such as food insecurity. Using survey data collected through the Child Care Resource Center (CCRC), this study examines the association between food insecurity risk, sociodemographic factors, and pandemic-related service changes among ECE providers in California. The results showed that income, race, and increased food costs were significantly associated with a higher risk of food insecurity among ECE providers. Compared to incomes greater than USD 60,000, those earning USD 40,000–USD 49,999 and USD 50,000–USD 59,999 had higher odds of food insecurity (OR: 1.94, 95% CI: 0.683–1.86; OR: 2.12, 95% CI: 0.623–1.81, respectively). Black (OR: 1.89, 95% CI: 1.21–2.94) and multi-racial respondents (OR: 1.71, 95% CI: 1.1–2.65) had higher odds of food insecurity than white respondents. Lastly, respondents experiencing increased food costs had greater odds of food insecurity (OR: 4.52, 95% CI: 2.74–7.45). These findings suggest the need for policies and interventions aimed at increasing food access among vulnerable ECE providers. Such interventions will better protect them from financial shocks and the risk of food insecurity, and will support their crucial role in healthy child growth and development.

In-depth interviews were conducted with female farm owners and managers (n = 16) across the state. Interviews were recorded and transcribed, and researchers coded interviews separately before thematic analysis was used to identify common themes. Three primary themes were identified: (i) formal healthcare challenges, (ii) stigma, and (iii) cultural norms. Formal healthcare challenges included time constraints, healthcare costs, and a lack of cultural competence from healthcare providers. Both community and self-stigma were identified as barriers to engaging with mental health resources. Cultural norms that acted as a barrier to care included the prioritization of farm operations, self-reliance, pride, and the minimization of health concerns. Interviewees identified gender differences in the impact of stigma and cultural norms, reporting that these sociocultural barriers were more prominent among older, male producers. Central to many of these barriers is the concept of ‘farm identity’, where farmers’ commitment to their operations consistently trumped concerns about physical or mental health. Future efforts to improve health outcomes among farmers should utilize the concept of farm identity as a guide for tailoring interventions and improving cultural competence among rural healthcare providers.

We examined differences in active physical recreation (APR) participation based on clusters of high and low motor competence and perceptions from grades 3–5. Participants were a longitudinal sample (n = 155; 85 girls) of grade three, four, and five children. Fundamental motor skills (FMSs) were assessed using the TGMD-2, perceptions were assessed using the Self-Perception Profile for Children, and APR was measured using the Children’s Assessment of Participation and Enjoyment. K-means cluster analysis was used to create four clusters per grade based on participants’ FMSs and PPC z-scores. Differences in FMSs, PPC, and APR with cluster group as a factor were examined using a series of factorial ANOVAs. In each grade, participants in the high–high cluster participated in significantly more APR than those in the low–low cluster (p = 0.002 in grades three and four; p < 0.001 in grade five). Among the less accurate clusters (e.g., low FMSs with high PPC) was a trend toward positive FMSs growth among the children with higher perceptions. Results show that combinations of FMSs and PPC influence patterns of engagement or disengagement in active physical recreation persistently across middle childhood.

However, the effectiveness of behavior change interventions is challenged by a lack of spatiotemporal contexts, limiting our understanding of factors that influence the timing and location in which day-to-day activities occur and the maintenance of behavior change. This study explored how behavior change interventions could incorporate spatiotemporal contexts of patient activities for modifying behaviors. Methods: A mixed-methods approach with adapted geo-ethnography techniques was used to solicit detailed descriptions of patients’ day-to-day routines, including where, when, and how patients spend time. Data were gathered from patients in one cardiac intervention program in Nova Scotia, Canada, from June to September 2021. Results: A total of 29 individuals (19 men and 10 women) between the ages of 45 and 81 and referred to the program after a cardiac event participated. The results show three key findings: (1) most patients exceeded the minimum guidelines of 30 min of daily physical activity but were sedentary for long periods of time, (2) patient time-use patterns are heterogenous and unique to contexts of individual space-time activity paths, and (3) time-use patterns reveal when, where, and how patients spend significant portions of time and opportunities for adapting patients’ day-to-day health activities. Conclusions: This study demonstrates the potential for interventions to integrate tools for collecting and communicating spatial and temporal contexts of patient routines, such as the types of activities that characterize how patients spend significant portions of time and identification of when, where, and how to encourage health-promoting changes in routine activities. Time-use patterns provide insight for tailoring behavior change interventions so that clinic-based settings are generalizable to the contexts of where, when, and how patient routines could be adapted to mitigate cardiovascular risk factors.

Therefore, this study investigates the factors associated with psychological distress among sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) migrant workers across Australia and Canada during the COVID-19 pandemic. Method: Data were collected from 378 first-generation migrant workers with SSA ancestry residing in Australia and Canada using the Depression Anxiety and Stress Scale 21 (DASS-21). Multivariate logistic regression analysis was used to determine socio-demographic factors associated with depression, anxiety, and stress among SSA migrants’ populations. Results: Across both countries, migrants with lower levels of education were more prone to reporting feelings of depression, anxiety, and stress during the pandemic. Female participants in Australia were more likely to report feeling of depression. Participants in Australia and Canada who were separated/divorced/widowed were less likely to report stress and depression, respectively. Participants in Australia who had lived in Australia between 11 and 20 years and those between 36 and 50 years old were more likely to report feelings of depression. Participants residing in Australia whose SSA ancestry was Southern Africa/Central Africa were more likely to report anxiety. Participants in Australia who worked as part-time permanent workers and those who worked as fixed-term workers/short-term/casual workers were less likely to report anxiety. Finally, participants in Canada who reported two or more people living with them had higher odds of reporting anxiety. Conclusions: The findings from this study highlight key factors associated with SSA migrant workers’ psychological distress during the pandemic. The results can inform policies and provide insight to the development of mental health intervention strategies for migrant workers to minimize similar distress during pandemics.

These technologies allow for the continuous monitoring of motor development and the state of motor abilities from infancy to old age, enabling early and personalized interventions to promote healthy motor skills. For athletes, they offer valuable insights to optimize technique and prevent injuries, while in old age, they help maintain mobility and prevent falls. Integration with artificial intelligence further extends these capabilities, enabling sophisticated data analysis. Wearable technology is transforming the way we approach motor development and maintenance of motor skills, offering unprecedented possibilities for improving health, performance, and quality of life at every stage of life. The promising future of these technologies paves the way for an era of more personalized and effective healthcare, driven by innovation and interdisciplinary collaboration.

These women—referred to as Tongqi—often discover they are in a loveless marriage, but any effort to change their situation results in intense backlash, discrimination, and stigma from families, village communities, and even government and healthcare institutions. This study explores the experiences of Tongqi, examining the influence of social interaction, community relationships, and macrostructural factors that coalesce to create an environment of chronic enacted stigma. In-depth interviews were conducted with 59 rural Tongqi, 11 of whom contracted human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) or acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) from their spouses. The findings reveal the significant role of extended kinship networks and macrostructural elements, such as hukou (household registration) and government officers, as well as village-level lineage structures. Informant data highlights how lineage relationships, interwoven with gender practices, contribute to the enacted stigma impacting the physical and psychological health of Tongqi. Tongqi report psychological effects such as an array of symptoms reflecting post-traumatic stress, chronic depression, and attempted suicide. Tongqi also report adverse physical health concerns involving reproductive health, unwanted pregnancies, sexually transmitted infections (STIs), and pregnancy complications. These findings helped produce possible policy recommendations to address the most pressing issues faced by Tongqi.

This study investigated the mental health, mental fatigue, quality of life, and stigma of social discrimination among healthcare workers in the United Arab Emirates (UAE) during the COVID-19 pandemic. A correlational, cross-sectional, multi-centric design was employed to collect data from 1383 healthcare workers across various healthcare settings. Participants were recruited using combined cluster and purposive sampling techniques. Standardized questionnaires, including the COVID-19 Pandemic Mental Health Questionnaire (CoPaQ), the Mental Fatigue Scale (MFS), the Social Discrimination Scale-Stigma Subscale (SDS), and the WHO Quality of Life Questionnaire-Brief (WHOQOL-BREF), were administered to assess the study variables. The results indicated significant mental health impacts, with high average scores for post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) (9.37 ± 6.74) and positive coping by inner strengths (17.63 ± 5.72). Mental fatigue was prevalent (8.15 ± 8.62), and stigma of social discrimination scored notably (23.83 ± 7.46). Quality of life was the highest in the social domain (65.38 ± 24.58). Significant correlations were observed between mental health subscales, mental fatigue, and quality of life domains. These findings highlight the critical need for targeted mental health support programs, improved social support networks, and personalized interventions to mitigate the mental health challenges faced by healthcare workers. Healthcare organizations can guarantee a resilient workforce that can handle future health crises by giving mental health resources and support systems top priority.

This study aimed to analyze the association between prolonged leisure screen time and healthy and unhealthy food consumption indicators among Brazilian adults (≥18 years). Methods: Data from the National Health Survey (NHS), conducted in 2019 (n = 88,531), were used. Prolonged leisure screen time (screen time ≥ 3 h/day) was analyzed in three dimensions: watching TV; use of electronic devices; and total screen time (TV and electronic devices). Food consumption was analyzed in two dimensions: healthy (in natura and minimally processed foods) and unhealthy (ultra-processed foods). Poisson regression models were used to calculate prevalence ratios (crude and adjusted (PRa)) by sociodemographic factors (sex, age, schooling, income, area of residence, and race/color) and health factors (weight status, self-rated health, and presence of noncommunicable disease), to assess the association between prolonged screen time and food consumption indicators. Results: Among Brazilian adults, the prevalence of prolonged screen time was 21.8% for TV and 22.2% for other electronic devices for leisure. The highest frequency of watching TV for a prolonged time was observed among women, older adults, and those with a lower income and schooling. Prolonged use of electronic devices was more common among young adults and those with intermediate schooling and income. Prolonged screen time was associated with an unhealthy diet, due both to the higher consumption of unhealthy foods (PRa = 1.35 for TV, PRa = 1.21 for electronic devices, and PRa = 1.32 for both types) and the lower consumption of healthy foods (PRa = 0.88 for TV, PRa = 0.86 for electronic devices, and PRa = 0.86 for both). Conclusions: Prolonged screen time was negatively associated with the consumption of healthy foods and favored the consumption of unhealthy foods among Brazilian adults.

A review of the epidemiology of diarrhoea in children under five showed a high disease burden. This study aimed to identify Diarrhoeagenic Escherichia coli (DEC) and Salmonella spp. contamination of food and water in urban and rural areas of Maputo consumed by children under five with diarrhoea. One hundred and eighty-six children with diarrhoea were selected from Primeiro de Maio and Marracuene Health Care Centres from the Kamaxakeni and Marracuene districts, respectively. Food (n = 167) and water (n = 100) samples were collected in children’s households for diarrhoeagenic bacterial identification. Interviews were conducted using a semi-structured questionnaire to collect data about demographics and foods consumed a week before the children’s diarrhoea episodes. The prevalence of both DEC and Salmonella spp. was 9.8% in food and 5.4% in water samples. DEC was most prevalent in cereals (urban = 2.8%; rural = 2.4%) and water samples (urban = 1.4%; rural = 3.3%). Salmonella spp. was mainly detected in cereals (urban = 0.7%; rural = 0.8%). Diarrhoeagenic pathogens were associated with the type of food frequently consumed by children under five years with diarrhoea (infant formula, fruit puree, ready-to-eat meals, and bottled water), while the association with demographics was absent. We found that the infant foods consumed by children with diarrhoea are associated with DEC and Salmonella spp., and the prevalence of these contaminants is higher in the rural (8.9%) than in the urban area (6.3%), showing the need for caregiver education on food handling practices.

This paper discusses the integration of ICD-11 into UNRWA’s cloud-based electronic medical record (EMR) system, identifying both the barriers and facilitators involved and analyzing trends in clinical documentation and healthcare utilization. The key challenges included data privacy provisions, integration into a coordinated care model, complex classification schema for primary care settings, frequent staff turnover, and limited data analysis capabilities. Conversely, facilitators included physician-tailored training and on-site support, system compatibility, a multidisciplinary team approach, policy support from UNRWA and the World Health Organization (WHO), and leadership commitment and effective change management. Medical officers (MOs) using ICD-11 reported greater satisfaction with the system’s capabilities in managing and visualizing health information. This article contributes to the discourse on health data management in complex humanitarian settings, offering insights into the benefits and challenges of implementing advanced classification systems like ICD-11. Future research should explore longitudinal impacts and further integration with global health systems, ensuring that the advancements in classification continue to support the overarching goal of health equity and access in vulnerable and hard-to-reach populations.

These institutions were established by federal and state governments to forcibly assimilate Indigenous children into foreign cultures through spiritual, physical, and sexual abuse and through the destruction of critical connections to land, family, and tribal community. This literature review focuses on the impact of one of the oldest orphanages, asylums, and Indigenous residential boarding schools in the United States. The paper shares perspectives on national and international parallels of residential schools, land, truth and reconciliation, social justice, and the reconnection of resiliency-based Indigenous Knowledge towards ancestral strength, reclamation, survivorship, and cultural continuance.

This work aims to determine the differences in the six-minute walking test (6MWT) between EE and healthy subjects residing at more than 5000 m. Methods: A prospective, cross-sectional study was performed on 71 men (36 healthy and 25 suffering from EE) living in La Rinconada, Peru (5100 m). Basal levels of [Hb] and Hct were obtained. All the subjects performed the 6MWT, and distance reached, vital signs, dyspnea, and fatigue (Borg scale) at the end of the test were recorded. Results: The average [Hb] and Hct levels in the control group were 18.7 ± 1.2 g/dL and 60.4 ± 7.1%, respectively, contrasting with EE subjects, who showed 23.4 ± 1.6 g/dL and 73.6 ± 5.9% (p < 0.001). However, no statistically significant differences were observed in BMI or other anthropometric parameters. At the end of the 6MWT, the distance traveled and vital constants were similar between both groups, except for arterial oxygen saturation, which was consistently lower in subjects with EE throughout the test. Conclusion: EE does not significantly affect 6MWT performance at high altitudes, nor the hemodynamic control during moderate aerobic exercise of subjects who live permanently in a severely hypoxic environment.

Our objective was to evaluate, with a two-wave perspective design, the relationships of work ability, social support, and occupational stress with workplace violence in nurses. In an Italian public health company, we asked nurses to self-assess their work ability using the Work Ability Index (WAI) and we analyzed the relationship between this indicator and the violence experienced in the previous and following years. A total of 321 out of 344 nurses (99.3%) participated. In a logistic regression model, the WAI score was a significant protective factor for violence experienced in the previous year (OR = 0.94 CI95% = 0.90; 0.98 p < 0.01) and in the following year (OR = 0.88 CI95% = 0.84; 0.92 p < 0.01). In a hierarchical logistic regression model, social support acted as a protective factor (OR = 0.87 CI95% = 0.79; 0.95 for violence experienced in the previous year), while occupational stress was a significant determinant of the risk of aggression (OR = 3.65 CI95% = 1.90; 7.03 in the previous year, OR = 3.54 CI95% = 1.801; 6.947 in the following year). The difficulties that nurses encounter in carrying out their growing work demands in an environment that is not promptly adapted to their changing physical and mental states can lead to an increased risk of violence. Prevention of workplace violence should include organizational and ergonomic measures that reduce stress and increase staff support and work ability.

Understanding the protective and risk factors that influence aging trajectories is crucial for designing targeted interventions that support healthy aging and improve people’s quality of life. The aim of this study was to explore the relationships between variables of aging. A total of 103 Italian participants (55–75 years old) underwent multidimensional assessments that covered cognitive, functional, emotional, and quality of life dimensions. Structural equation modeling was used to analyze the data and elucidate the relationships between depression, quality of life, cognitive reserve, executive functions, and daily autonomy. The findings revealed that a higher quality of life was associated with reduced depressive symptoms. In addition, cognitive reserve emerged as a protective factor positively correlated with both quality of life and daily autonomy. In this study, quality of life was determined using physical health, psychological, social relationships, and environmental domains. Identifying the significant relationships between these variables in a sample of late adults and young-aged people has given us useful elements for designing psycho-educational interventions that can be aimed at preventing frailty in later old age or supporting healthy longevity.

Recovery from a stroke episode can be a long-impacting process with reduced quality of life outcomes. Past studies have explored the quality of life (QoL) of stroke survivors. However, none have explored the QoL of stroke survivors in Southeastern Nigeria. This study therefore describes the QoL of Nigerian stroke survivors in Southeastern Nigeria. One hundred and one participants (44 male and 58 female) were recruited into the study. QoL domains were assessed using the stroke-specific Health-Related Quality of Life in Stroke Patients (HRQOLISP). The physical domain was significantly lower than other domains measured (mean = 2.52, SD = 0.76), contributing to poor quality of life. On the other hand, the spiritual domain had the greatest positive influence on QoL (mean = 3.70, SD = 0.50). We found the physical domain was the poorest part of stroke survivors’ stroke experience. The spiritual domain had a positive impact on improving QoL. There is a need for research on interventions relating to the physical rehabilitation of stroke survivors and a review of how the spiritual domain can be enhanced to improve QoL.

The management of virtual presenteeism, where employees continue teleworking despite being ill, has received limited attention. This study explores the relationship between managers’ stress management competencies (SMCs), mental health, and job performance of virtual presentees, aiming to fostering more functional presenteeism. We examine whether managers’ SMCs promote functional presenteeism by comparing managers’ self-assessments with employee assessments, and analyzing how agreement levels between the two affect mental health and job performance. Data were collected from 365 teleworkers supervised by 157 managers in a large public organization in Québec. The results indicate that virtual presentees’ mental health and job performance are closely linked to employees’ assessment of their managers’ SMCs. Employees who agreed with their manager or overestimated their managers’ SMCs exhibited better mental health and job performance than those who agreed with their manager on low SMCs or underestimated their managers. This study expands on the health-performance framework of presenteeism and self-other agreements, highlighting management practices that should be enhanced in the context of virtual presenteeism.
