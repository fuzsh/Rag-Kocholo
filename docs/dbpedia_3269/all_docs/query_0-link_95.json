        "text": "I might just be the exception to your rule then Tom......\n\nI was 6 in 1990 and didn't remember much except for sitting in my pyjamas watching England play a team in Green (Cameroon as I later found out). But by the next year I was 7 - I was old enough to understand the beautiful game.\n\nI wore out my highlights of the tournament tape - I watched it that often. I almost remember it like it was live. Scifo and Culemans of Belgium, Roberto Baggio's dribble against the Czech's, Platt's volley, O'Leary's penalty, Voller and Rijkaards \"incident\" the drama of penalties, Gazza's tears - England's heartbreak.\n\nSo by 1992 I watched the Euros and that seemed awesome... but the best was yet to come.... surely? I was hooked on the World Cup ideal - I remember watching every single one of England's qualifiers and sitting in tears after the defeat in Oslo left qualification hagning by a thread.\n\nI remember the unfairness and the indignity of defeat in Rotterdam - I remember the dignity of Graham Taylor in falling on his sword and taking responsibility.\n\nSo maybe the reason that my first real World Cup watched (1994) was such a disappointment was the fact that England weren't there. But I suspect that it was more than that. 1990 was held in a country that lives and breathes football. In '94 the greatest competition on earth got the brash, undignified, classless Hollywood treatment. Yes there were some memories.... Houghton's goal, the Bulgarians beating Germany, Baggio's pomp and the Brazil v Netherlands quarter final. But ultimately the tournament disappointed. The final was awful and I was left with such a sense of disappointment.\n\nThen came 1998. Which was fantastic. The flair of Brazil, the dreams of the French nation, the Beckham saga, the emergence of Owen, the lucklessness of the Dutch.\n\nBut personally.... my favourite World Cup was the last one. Germany 2006 had everything, drama, fairytales, good football, goals, excitment, the England hard luck story, Beckham's tears and a dramatic finale.\n\nFor me that is the best World Cup that I've ever seen - 1994 (my first) just doesn't come close.\n\nThe first World Cup I can remember was '94 when I was eight, but as England weren't involved in that, the first tournament to have that nostalgic first-time effect on me was Euro '96.\n\nI remember it so vividly. First of all, it wasn't just about the football. Three Lions was the official anthem and was completely inescapable at the time, much to my glee - everyone used to sing it at the top of their high-pitched little voices on the school bus (restrospectively, I'm surprised that the driver didn't just choose to drive the coach off the nearest bridge at full speed - you don't realise how annoying you must be when you're just a pre-pubescent juvenile). Even when I hear it now, it instantly overloads me that nostlagic jumper-for-goal-posts kind of feeling.\n\nThe whole nation was engaged in the tournament, even those annoying people that don't normally follow football, but get all over-excited when England are playing in a tournament and act is if they're football-crazy (that was the one positive about England not qualifying for Euro 2008 - we didnt' have to put up with those idiots for once).\n\nThat first game against Switzerland (the day before my tenth birthday), which finished 1-1, wasn't exactly breathtaking and did little to entice a restless child of my age. That all changed though the moment David Seaman saved Gary McCallister's penalty against Scotland a week later, which was duly followed by that magical goal from a pre-mental Gazza.\n\nThe rest of England's involvement is so fresh in my memory, it's as if it all only just happened. The 4-1 thrashing of Holland is probably my favourite memory, as when you're ten, seeing your team score four goals in a game is just about the best thing in the world (I support West Ham, so that's something that still does excite me due to the rarirty of it happening regularly!).\n\nWinning the penalty shoot-out against Spain in the quarter-finals was just as exciting. Again, when you're that age, seeing a goalkeeper save a penalty does seem pretty astounding and feels like you've just witnessed the impossible happen. Therefore, despite his Arsenal affiliation, David Seaman does have a special place in my heart (even more so since me and my old uni housemates discovered his genius TV presenting skills in his two DVDs Goalkeeping Nightmares and Jeepers Keepers).\n\nThe semi-final against Germany probably summed up exactly what it's like to support England. It all started off so well with the tournament's top scorer, Alan Shearer, giving England an early lead, before it was cancelled out by some German bloke with a name whose humour was lost upon my innocent ten-year old mind (Kuntz). Then there was the extra-time, made all the more gripping and nerve-racking by the new ill-fated Golden Goal system. Darren Anderton hit the post and Gazza was just a nano-second too late to connect to a cross in front of a practically open goal, which would have sealed it. I also seem to recall Germany having a goal disallowed, which cued a nationwide simaltaneous sigh of relief. We all know how it ended of course. I remember clearly though how excellent England's first five penalties were - just a shame that Gareth Southgate took the sixth!\n\nIt felt horrible to get knocked out in that fashion after we had played so well. I felt like a brand new toy that I absolutely loved had been snatched away by some cruel, arrogant bully. It completely ruined the following Sunday, which should have seen us beating the Czech Republic and lifting the trophy in front of a jubilant Wembley and, indeed, nation.\n\nMaybe that was the best thing that could have happened though, as I learnt at the earliest opportunity how hard and frustrating it can be if you support England. I feel sorry for those older folks whose first England memory was 1966 - imagine how let down they must have felt in the years that followed!\n\n1990 was my first World Cup memory- a great tournamet and a bewildering experience for a six year old. The thing I remember was Gazza blubbing and wondering what was wrong with Chris Waddle.\n\nHowever, this was not the formative footballing trauma that shapped my little footballing brain. That event was Arsenal's defeat to Spurs in the 1991 FA Cup Semi. Again I remember Gazza, my first visit to the Twin Towers was frightening in an exciting way- and most of all I remember the bitterness of defeat- that was when the young lad who loved the Arsenal in a care free sort of way and enjoyed the spin off of being bought fish and chips on a Saturday, chrysatlised into a Gooner. That was when the pain and the passion was unleashed, one might say.\n\nOn the international scene, helped by how rubbish Graham Taylor's England were, the main event for me has to be Euro 96. By this point I knew what football was, played, watched Arsenal home and away and in finals thanks to my Dad, so there was none of the 1990 bewilderment, just an intense footballing experience that I hadn't had with England before. Yet again, the tragic Gazza ranks highly, alongside numerous moments of collective and individual brilliance and drama. Seaman's penalty saves, Adams leading the team like a true lion, the exquisit combination of Shearer and Sheringham in their pomp- priceless and ultimately soul destroying. But that's football eh?\n\nMost people know a piece of music that almost literally electrifies them. Hairs standing on end and tears to the eyes sort of thing. For me one such tune is that Jean Michelle Jarre thing that was played relentlessly (albeit by a rival broadcasting company) during June 1998. I was 7 years old in 94 and had struggled to take in the time differences and the absence of England. But I can remember so much detail from France '98, from the whole Becks saga, to running out into the street because I thought Sol Campbell had scored a winner against Argentina, only for my Dad to yell at me to get back inside. Even things like the Blanc and Barthez tender moments and that Paraguayan keeper that took all their set pieces and Jamaica being made up of retiring Wimbledon players and Croatia embarassing the Germans. It still feels like yesterday.\n\n'02 was hard again because of the time differences but I do remember taking a lot of mornings off school and '06 may have been a let down, partly due to the fact that none of my mates could work out why we had gone to France and not Germany... but both are still just about the biggest reference points I have in my sad life so far and I have high hopes for next year.\n\nThe world cup is just about the best thing there is isn't it?\n\nTom, i think you are right that the first World Cup you remember is the best '82 was mine as well and i remember being amazed that there were so many games to watch, as the tournament progressed you start to realize the importance and why your dad was going on about it for weeks before. Lying awake at night wondering if Keegan and Brooking would be fit, watching Northern Ireland do the impossible and wondering why we couldn't.\n\nOnce England were out was the new sensation of choosing your team for the rest of the tournament, i poured through my Ladybird guide to the World Cup (still a pristine prized possession) to make up my mind; i lucked out and chose Italy the team with the old man in goal and the striker back from a ban for betting. The classic Italy - Brazil game permanently engraved on my brain, the great defence against a little bloke called Maradona.\n\nIt wasn't till the final that i really saw what it was all about and what it meant, Marco Tardelli's goal and his reaction still send a shiver down my spine just thinking about it and i become 8 and 3/4's again, how would i cope if England were in the final? Not sure but know i will try to soak it up like the wide eyed kid i once was if it ever happens. Here's hoping\n\nSo true. So true. So true.\n\nBeing 22 now, my first real tournament was '94. I know I was round for '90, but being 4 it is v.vague.\n\nAnyhow I can somehow remember everything in 94, simply because I breathed, drank, eat that world cup. From watching the genius Hagi performing miracles for Romania, to seeing Escobar scoring THAT unfortunate and sad own goal. From Houghton scoring that cracker against Italy to laughing at Alexy Lalas' ginger mop. From Maradona being banned for testing positive to Roberto Baggio sending that kick over the bar! That world cup had it all.\n\nMost of all though, it was Brazil (unsurprising) that my heart sank towards. Romario's goals, Bebeto's baby celebration, Leonardo's elbow (which i've now realised is wrong, and should now be punished appropriately), Branco's free kick and of course the Adidas advert that kicked of with 'how to play soccer like a brazilian' tune. It was new for the yanks, it was new for me. Dunga, Mauro Silva, I can name you every player in that team to this day. I also took a liking to the Argie, not so much for Maradona, hadn't been educated enough, but because of a young Batistuta who I aspired to be.\n\nPoetry in motion was the '94 World Cup. I'll never forget it. And to think a certain young Ronaldo was on the bench for Brazil - who in my opinion has become the greatest striker ever to grace the game!\n\nThe older I have got the more mixed my feelings about Northern Ireland as a football team have become (I'm from Belfast) and while the \"other\" Irish team feels more comfortable for me in many ways, it's also not *really* my team.\n\nI remember 74 (I dearly wanted the Dutch to win) and 78 - thought the Argentinians again cheated the Dutch. But it is, of course, 82 that sticks in the memory.\n\nMy father, brother and I watched the NI/Spain game and went through every permutation of how NI could get through to the next round, but never even mentioned the prospect of victory. Then the goal - total stunned silence in the house at such a gloriously unexpected moment. And the grim last 15 minutes as Spain poured everything into it and Mal was sent off entirely unfairly.\n\nActually, they played much better football in the Austria game - they clearly had some belief by then and played like a truly world class team and if Martin's perfectly good opener against France had been allowed the whole history of world football could look very different today.\n\nSadly I think the IFA over the years squandered the fact that it was one of the few sporting institutions in the North with cross community buy-in, and I find all the \"GOWA\" and \"OWC\" stuff offensive precisely because it fails to recognise the legitimacy of the other community's aspirations. I'd love to see a 32 county team - the rugby boys have shown how powerful that could be - but not in my lifetime.\n\nAlthough Spain '82 was the first WC I remember anything of (Keegan missing, Maradona sent off, Schumacher's attack) it is '86 I really remember as my first proper WC.\n\nBut even though it's my first I still don't regard it was the best WC I've seen, that would have to go to Italia '90. Yup, the initial group matches weren't that great, but that tournament was everything what being an England supporter is all about. A dreary draw in the first match, a great performance that deserved a win not a draw in the second and a dull win for the final group match. Second round - a tense affair ended in stunning style by Platt. Quarters - cruising at first then Cameroon hit back and we're all but out, two penalties and almost heart failures laters and we're through to the semi's. Semi's - arguably one of the greatest WC matches of all time, two teams going hell for leather and being perfectly matched. One of the greatest ever England performances but it's not to be. Germany did deserve the WC in the end, they were the best team of the tournament.\n\nFor all that though, my outstanding WC moment is the site of Marco Tardelli screaming his own name in tears after he scores what is essentially the winning goal of the '82 WC. If anyone ever asks why football means so much, just show them that celebration. *That's* what it's like to score the winning goal in a World Cup final.\n\nThe first I clearly remember is 86; Maradona, brilliant, Belgium looking good, France going out way too early, Lineker (it's in there)banging in goals for fun and of course my Mexico 86 Panini Sticker album which led to much wasted money over the next 3 or 4 years as I then decided to do each domestic season's album.\n\nLike someone above though I had just got a TV for my room, tiny and really pants but I remember sneakily watching the game against morocco (ouch) and also the one against Poland (much sweeter) and then having to pretend I didn't know the score when I wearily woke the next morning for school (I would have been 10).\n\nI remember my Dad (and me) being relegated to the spare room and a very grainy black and white TV for Espana 82 and being young only thing I remember a spanish player called Juanito diving all over the shop like he had been shot. I believe he died in a car crash years before his time. Still, for the wrong reasons he left an impression on me.\n\nAnally watched USA 94; A levels and school had just finished and could pretty much stay up until whenever watching the games. Also pubs had just been discovered (I mean by me, not in general; that would be a silly comment) so could watch down pub.\n\nItalia 90 had loads of excitement for an England fan like myself but the fouls were cynical and the style of football a word that I cannot write on here. And the mascot \"Ciao\" was no \"Pique\" (or even Naranjito)\n\nWonderful how everyone has such beatiful memories concerning Summer tournaments. Everyone commenting seems to had the best time of their lifes - after all we are all young, curious and football of that level was still something pretty rare to watch on the telly.\n\nMy first World Cup was Italia'90 and despite being not even 7 years of age I can remember most of the games. The shock of Cameroon beating Argentina in the opening game, the draws in England's group, the unbelievable Argentinian penalty killer Goycoechea, the rise of Toto Schillachi, the dramatic game between Argentina and Brazil decided by a moment of magic from Maradona and Caniggia, England's dramatic wins vs Belgium and Cameroon, Waddle's miss and the undeserved and very problematic win of Germany in the final after some very dodgy refereeing.\n\nAs someone stated before all the teams from the past tournaments had one or two star players everyone looked up to and waited anxiously to watch them play and perform their magic.\n\nArgentina - Maradona & Caniggia\n\nBrazil - Romario & Bebeto\n\nCzechoslovakia - Moravcik & Skuhravy\n\nUruguay - Francescoli\n\nBelgium - Scifo & Ceulemans\n\nCameroon - Makanaky (does anyone remember him?)\n\nEngland - Gazza, Lineker and Platt\n\nGermany - Haessler, Moeller, Littbarski and Matthaeus\n\nSweden - Brolin\n\nItaly - Baggio\n\nAnd so on and on. It's pure poetry to say that names. Is it me or we don't have that kind of players nowadays anymore. Or is it due to the fact that football has become so omnipresent that that magic has gone missing in between of all those Champions League games being played all over again.\n\nI remember that in the past tournaments there was always the element of surprise in terms of discovering some new, unknown talent. That is something we can't experience anymore.\n\nI with you Tom, Spain 82 was my first World Cup. Had loads of memorabilia I remember, all of it seemingly involving that tubby orange that was the mascot. Being only 8 I don't remember all that much about the England games, but I do remmeber the Scotland Brazil match and Narey putting Scotland ahead and then Brazil just taking the poor Scots apart. And I remember Northern Ireland's run as well. Also remember racing home from School to watch afternoon games. Somehow I always expect to see Peru and Hungary and Austria and Chile in World Cups, just because they were at Spain '82.\n\nBUT my favourite World Cup memories all seem to revolve around Italia 90. That was my GCSE year, and as I remember it exams were pretty much all over before the tournament began, and was at an age when I could appreciate the football (and boy was it good!) but also had enough youthful naivety not to be cynical. Somehow Roger Mila, being an important figure in both Spain and Italy, is entrinsically linked with the World Cup in my mind. But Italia 90 had it all from Cameroon beating Argentina in the opening game, to Ireland's quarter final run, to the Scots being typically Scottish and bottling it totally, to England's growing momentum to some great players being well... great. And all set against a blazing hot summer. (1990 was a pretty goos summer for sport as I remember it, what with the footy, and Graham Gooch scoring a ton of runs, amongst other things.)\n\nMy first proper World Cup memories were of Italia '90 and it remains THE one I always think of whenever there is mention of the World Cup.\n\nFor one summer, England seemed to genuinely believe we had a chance of winning it...not the same old \"we might win it this year\" throwaway thoughts that we all have every World Cup, but a real, tangible belief that we might do it. We had Gazza in the middle of the park and Lineker to stick it in the net....It didn't happen and the rest is history, but whenever I see re-runs of the games, there's still a part of me watching, waiting, hoping the result goes the other way, just like the first time. It never does.\n\nThere seems to be a never ending list of reasons why that tournament sticks in my mind most and why I'll always look back on that as the best World Cup (unless we win it!!!).\n\nThe passion of the Italians on home turf, Pavarotti belting out Nesun Dorma (Definitely the greatest World Cup theme song of all time!), Lothar Mattheus and Jurgen Klinsmann, Toto Schillaci, my first glimps of 'The Divine Ponytail' as Baggio went on to be known, Roger Milla dancing at the corner flag and teams like Costa Rica and Cameroon (two countries I had never heard of, let alone believed could be at a World Cup)....The list of memories goes on and on.\n\nFor me, reeling off the list of those names still makes the hairs on my neck stand up - they seemed to be gods almost, and no-one would ever be as good as them...\n\nI love football.\n\nI'm Brazilian and was 8 years old living in Rio de Janeiro during World Cup '94. I remember seeing how everything would stop during the games when Brazil played and how everyone would go to the streets and the bars and watch the games together.\n\nThe tournament itself was amazing, we didn't have much faith in our \"selecao\" at the start, but soon they started winning and everyone could sense something was coming. The best part was that no matter where you were you felt like you were in a stadium, you could hear people yelling outside and clapping and cheering.\n\nDuring the final my entire large family watched it over at my Grandmother's house. I remember everyone staring intently at the tv, sufferring with every near miss and cringing at every tackle. After regulation and extra time I decided I had enough, I got up and left the room and went into a bedroom to pray. On my knees with my yellow jersey I sat crouched asking for a victory. I kept praying and after a little while God answered in the form of fireworks and people yelling, \"E Tetra.\"\n\nI was 8 and that night we walked down to the beach (along with 250,000 other people) and my parents were too happy to care about our bedtime.\n\nLove this thread!\n\n1990 was my first & yes, the best. I accept everyone's subsequent comments about the standard of the football, but the festival-of-football aspect was like nothing I'd experienced.\n\nI just want to mention that my dad said that he missed the 1982 final to play with a 2 year-old me. I mean, all credit to him for dedicated parenting, but I mean who does that?!\n\nThe 1986 tournament was, apparently, while we were on holiday in Greece, although I have a feeling we were home in time to watch the final. All I remember of it was a caption saying \"Rumenigge\".\n\nAnyway, 1990 was my first tournament, aged 10. The run-up to it involved collecting things called Cop-A-Cards which were issued by Merseyside Police & you got them from policemen on the street. There was one card for each member of the squad & one showing the whole squad posed together. If you collected all the cards, you could go to the police station & get a green card-holder thing to stick them in. Once I had them all, I faked autographs on them all - how sad! Probably reduced the value of them, too. Then it was collecting the WC guides. I must've had 10 or more, with wallcharts & everything. And yes, I've still got them.\n\nOn the opening evening, my parents insisted I do homework instead of watch the match, so I had the radio on in my room while I was working... until they found out & made me switch it off! I suppose this was a recurring theme as they made me switch off West Germany v Holland at half-time to go to bed (but not before Voller & Rijkaard showered each other in spit!).\n\nI bought the highlights video almost as soon as it came out, so many of my \"memories\" are from the tape & not from the time itself. Things like Baggio's goal against Czechoslovakia, Platt's brilliant volley to knock out Belgium, Gazza crying, the missed pens etc. But there are a few memories that weren't on the tape...\n\n- Scotland v Costa Rica.\n\n- Matthaeus's single-handed destruction of Yugoslavia.\n\n- Argentine 'keeper Nery Pumpido being injured & replaced with Goycochea who was much better.\n\n- Colombian 'keeper Rene Higuita losing the ball to the aged-but- brilliant Roger Milla of Cameroon who scored 2 in that game. Milla always played the game at like half the pace of everyone around him - how did he make it look so easy?\n\n- Dezotti being sent off at the end of the final, after Monzon had become the first to be dismissed. I remember supporting Argentina for the majority of the match & switching allegiance when people kept getting sent off.\n\nCan I just add that Rudi Voller's tumble in the box was somewhat dubious, while Calderon was clearly tripped in the deep of the German box from a corner & Argentina weren't given a pen. Should've been 1-0 to the most defensive, negative side in WC history!\n\n1994 for me was sitting up with my dad watching the only exciting game of the tournament: Argentina v Romania.\n\n1998 was my A-Level summer & I watched every game in a different pub or friend's house, apart from the first game against Tunisia. Having completely failed my AS Electronics exam, I used the rest of the time to write a report of that game! Promised my dad I'd watch the final with him & then went & watched it next door & he wasn't happy!\n\n2002 I remember very little, other than I was staying at my then-girlfriend's family's house in Lytham over the time that we played Brazil & I overslept & missed the game. She & her family weren't the slightest bit bothered.\n\n2006 I watched most games in pubs in Liverpool, apart from the Sweden game (the good one) when I was in a random pub in London. The day we played Portugal was the wedding of a very good friend of mine & probably the hottest day of the summer. Several ushers/guests had secret radios & I was listening to the shoot-out with one of them when the speeches started. I think it was the groom who opened by saying we'd just lost on pens. So that's 2 WCs in a row where I've missed our last game.\n\nSorry this is so long guys!\n\n1978... and Arie Haan scores the greatest goal in the entire history of the game. The wonderful Dutch team are 1-1 with Italy in their final game of the second group phase. No semi-finals in Argentina '78, it's round robin and, at 1-1, the Italians are 'catenaccioing' their way to the final. Holland must win. Enter Mr. Haan (a right back, I seem to recall - but those were the days of totaal foetball). From about 40 yards out, and about 10 yards in from the left hand touchline, he unleashes the most extraordinary right foot missile - he's so far out that Zoff, in the Italian goal, could have managed a quick glass of Pinot Grigio while awaiting it's arrival, but there's nothing he can do anyway and the ball screams into the top right hand corner. Holland win 2-1 and are in the World Cup Final. No-one has ever score a better goal that was as important as Haan's. I've watched it time and again and it continues to amaze - I swear that ball would be orbiting the planet if the net hadn't got in the way. Marvellous stuff!!\n\nWhat a wonderful side that Dutch team was. I'm too young to remember the 1974 Dutch team and they were said to be even better (well, they should've been, they had Cruyff) but the '78 team was also special - Johnny Rep, Johan Neeskens, the Van Der Kerkhoff twins, and best of all, the superb, scandalously underrated (and largely forgotten) Robbie Rensenbrink - as good a player as I've ever seen. I find the perennial fuss about Brazil every time a world cup comes around to be rather bemusing - they're just another bunch of European style chasers these days, too scared to play with wingers and 10 men behind the ball at every opportunity. About the only thing they have in common with Pele, Garrincha, Tostao, Zico, Socrates et al, are the shirts they wear - which sadly is enough to fool most BBC/ITV football 'experts' who gaze at them through gold tinted specs and wax lyrical about 'The Beautiful Game'. Ugh, it's enough to make you want to throw up. Frankly, the 'Beautiful Game' moved it's headquarters from Brazil to Holland in c.1974, and, with the occasional exception (1982, for example), it's resided there ever since. It's a crying shame that this fantastic football nation, which has given so much pleasure, and so many great players to the world, has never taken the ultimate step and won the big one. Naturally, in 1982, they were cheated out of the final - the Argentine Junta, having taken care of the situation to ensure a 6-0 win over a (damn good) Peruvian team just to get into the final, did a similar number on the ref. for the final and the rest is history. I think Johnny Rep has been quoted as saying he was glad Holland lost - he swears they'd never have made it out of the stadium alive if they'd won.\n\nP.S. Has anyone realised Diego Maradona's rather special feat of managing to disgrace himself at 4 consecutive World Cups (sent off for kicking a Brazilian in the stomach in 1982, the 'Hand of God' in 1986, captain of an Argentinian side that had 2 players sent off in the final in 1990 and just about debased the game that day - remember him blubbing whilst the Germans were collecting the trophy - and, last but not least, failing a drugs test and getting sent home in 1990. Way to go Diego Armando!! Anyone else know another player that can match that CV?\n\nMexico 86 for me. I was a wee bit too young to appreciate España 82, despite Davey Narey's glorious thunderbolt against Brazil. Mexico was a spectacular, sun-drenched explosion of 80s technicolor. Queen and Robert Palmer provided the soundtrack (as did Bananarama, unfortunately, though whenever my eardrums are assaulted by 'Venus', by way of compensation I get Proustian evocations of this marvellous footballing event, which is nice!) The tournament was lit up by all manner fantastic goals (Josimar, Negrete to name but two), scintillating individual performances (especially from one Diego Armando Maradona), and brilliant goal celebrations (Gordon Strachan's \"leg-over\" v W. Germany after \"attempting\" to propel his diminutive frame over the advertising hoardings gets my vote; pound for pound still the funniest ever).\n\nScotland were predictably drawn in the so-called Group of Death. Two highly credible performances versus the Danes and the West Germans sadly produced no points. The ignominious final group game against Uruguay still gives me nightmares. Brutally kicked off the park by the worst collection of footballing assassins since Argentina attempted to butcher their way past England in '66, Scotland predictably failed to grasp a golden opportunity to qualify for the 2nd round. Stevie Nicol's woeful side-footed \"attempt\" at a practically empty goal which gave the Uruguayan goalie all the time in the world to recover from a hopelessly stranded position can still produce a volley of foul-mouthed invective from me, just by thinking about it. Gah! Once again, after yet another campaign which had shown much promise, Scotland skulked home with their tails between their legs.\n\nThen there was England, who after a pretty rocky start sparked spectacularly into life with a cracking 3-0 victory v Poland, courtesy of a Gary Lineker hattrick. Paraguay were duly dispatched in similar fashion in the 2nd round, before the moment of reckoning with hot favourites Argentina. I do think that had John Barnes been introduced to the game earlier, England would have at least got to extra time. But little Diego was not to be denied, both by fair means and foul. If his 'divine' hand was greeted with howls of disgust this side of the equator, his second goal will probably go down as the greatest ever scored. It was like watching some Biblical tale unfolding before your very eyes.\n\nBut despite the pyrotechnics and controversy produced by El Dieguito, the best game of the tournament was France v Brazil, a thrilling 1-1 draw which was eventually decided in France's favour by Luis Fernandez's penalty kick. It was everything a World Cup game should be: a spectacular carnival of attacking flair. And the most exciting game of football I had ever seen, and I don't think I've seen much better since.\n\nI certainly have not seen a better World Cup than Mexico 86."
