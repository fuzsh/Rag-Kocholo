        "text": "Socrates, by which name we knew the Brazil football captain Socrates Brasileiro Sampaio de Souza Vieira de Oliveira, was a force of nature – and nicotine. This perhaps helps to explain why he performed with such thrilling slothfulness in taking penalties - that short passage of play that distils all a footballer's virtues and vices into his very essence. Examples abound: Cristiano Ronaldo exposed as a pathological show-off, Stuart Pearce as a sleeve with a pumping heart on it, Socrates as a two-pack-a-day man. While he was playing professional football he was also studying medicine, and post-dated comfortably that era when a footballer's excuse for puffing away was that smoking had not been identified as harmful; the time when the lads could be seen cheerfully dragging on their Woodbines in the communal bath was long gone. Even the great Sir Stanley Matthews, a model of rectitude in his personal habits, saw nothing wrong with endorsing the weed, attributing his \"smooth ball control\" to the \"smoothness of Craven A\". At this time the only real stricture on football and smoking was that it should not take place on the field of play.\n\nA newspaper reporter covering a match in Essex wrote: \"I am not anti-tobacconist but I do not think it is at all good form for a goalkeeper to be seen smoking a cigarette in goal while the game is in progress, and for a linesman to be seen smoking a pipe. Yet both incidents occurred on Saturday at Ilford.\" Come the 1980s, when Socrates captained his nation in two World Cups, he was never so overt with his smoking habit, but it does seem legitimate to wonder whether his skeletal presence moving a little stiffly among the midfield dynamos had something to do with his heroic nicotine intake.\n\nIn 1982 he led the greatest Brazil team to win diddly-squat – a side who might have won the World Cup in Spain had their leader inspired them to defend the 2-2 scoreline against Italy, which would have seen them into the semis at the expense of the eventual champions. It was a day for dynamos. Captain again at the 1986 World Cup in Mexico, Socrates was conspicuous in another failed effort by Brazil. His two-step penalties were masterpieces of their genre.\n\nThe one against Poland in the second round came off. Two leisurely paces and – pow! – Brazil were on their way to victory. But the one against France in the quarter-finals, taken under intense pressure in a penalty shootout, received its proper deserts, turned aside by the flying Joel Bats. In 2004, more than a decade after retiring, Socrates made football's most improbable comeback, playing for Garforth Town in the Northern Counties East League in England. It was the briefest of returns - a 20-minute cameo. He said he smoked too many cigarettes to play any longer. And it was cold. Bless."
