        "text": "Sony Computer Entertainment / ONE37pm\n\nSony Computer Entertainment clearly studied the dominance of Nintendo's Game Boy during the handheld wunderkind's 90s run. And just like Sony's own super influential Walkman audio player, the Japanese tech giant decided to produce a portable device that would enrapture buyers everywhere. And thankfully, that's exactly what happened when the PlayStation Portable launched back on March 24, 2005. Owners of Sony PlayStation's very first handheld gaming machine definitely kept a tower of game and movie cases containing Universal Media Discs. Speaking of games, we're here to make you all realize just how great the console's software library truly is. Here are the 35 best PSP games of all time.\n\nRELATED: The 50 Best PS3 Games of All Time\n\nBest PSP Games\n\nSony Computer Entertainment\n\n1. ‘God of War: Chains of Olympus’\n\nThe fourth God of War game was one of the many PSP games that convinced us that console-like experiences could be replicated on Sony's handheld machine. The same extreme levels of anger, blood, and gore that we loved from the first two GOW games were kept intact for Kratos's latest crusade against the Greek gods in GOW: Chains of Olympus. Kratos' mission to find both the Sun God Helios and the Dream God Morpheus leads to a captivating adventure that's capped off by one of the most heartbreaking moments in GOW history. Shout out to this game for letting us go crazy with the Sun Shield and Gauntlet of Zeus!\n\nBuy Now, $49.62\n\n2. ‘God of War: Ghost of Sparta’\n\nNow the sixth game in the ongoing GOW franchise convinced us even more of the PSP's penchant for delivering worthwhile experiences within Sony's first-party games library. GOW: Ghost of Sparta is truly a tale of learning more about one's self and fighting to repair broken relationships. Kratos embarks on another perilous adventure here and this time he does it in order to find his long-lost brother. And during that new trek through Ancient Greece, players get to tear everything to shreds with new weapons such as the Arms of Sparta and keep their signature Blades of Athena at the ready.\n\nBuy Now, $109.95\n\n3. ‘Killzone: Liberation’\n\nContrary to popular belief, Killzone 2 is actually the third game in Sony's FPS series. Killzone: Liberation is the actual follow-up to the first game in the series and is just as good as its PS2 counterpart. The challenge factor of this gritty handheld top-down shooter is what makes it such a PSP classic - you truly feel like you're deep in the trenches with your fellow infantrymen as you take the fight to waves of unrelenting soldiers. Even though this game is a bit too short for our tastes, we'll always remember enjoying the ride alongside Jan Templar.\n\nBuy Now, $10.98\n\n4. ‘Grand Theft Auto: Liberty City Stories’\n\nOnce Rockstar Games took a bet on the PSP, it hit it big by creating side games that offer more adventures within the series' most beloved city locales. Grand Theft Auto: Liberty City Stories goes the prequel route for its storyline and ends up being great because of it. Embarking on all the illegal activities of the original GTA III in handheld form blew our minds back then! And going back to this game to hop on some motorcycles, get into wild shootouts, and get a good look at landmarks that are being built for the mainline GTA III chronology is awesome.\n\nBuy Now, $29.99\n\n5. ‘Grand Theft Auto: Vice City Stories’\n\nAnother one of the best PSP games that come from the house of Rockstar Games is this prequel to GTA: Vice City. GTA: Vice City Stories is such a great foray into the crime-ridden world of the series thanks to its clever empire-building mechanic in which players open, operate, and defend (in the most violent manner possible!) their own business establishments in order to prosper in Vice City. Running, gunning, driving, and doing all sorts of illegal actions in Vice City Stories points to another reason why we loved Rockstar's games output on the PSP.\n\nBuy Now, $49.99\n\n6. ‘Grand Theft Auto: Chinatown Wars’\n\nOne of the best games on the DS ended up transitioning over to the PSP and got a preferred graphical enhancement in the process. Grand Theft Auto: Chinatown Wars reverts back to the top-down perspective of the first two games and produces one of the best handheld open-world crime simulators that we played far too much in public. The extra missions and radio station selections are just two more reasons why this DS to PSP port is one of Rockstar's finest works. Hotwiring and hacking cars in this game provide us with far too much joy!\n\nBuy Now, $79\n\n7. ‘Secret Agent Clank’\n\nThe PSP did a shockingly great job at giving PlayStation's platforming side characters their time to shine. Ratchet's little robotic buddy got that welcome treatment by taking the main protagonist role in Secret Agent Clank. Clank's responsibilities expanded as he dons a tuxedo to get into James Bond mode and use all sorts of clever gadgets to clear out the opposition. Major props go out to the sadly defunct High Impact Games for crafting this dope handheld platformer and letting us do big damage via the Blowtorch Briefcase.\n\nBuy Now, $15.59\n\n8. ‘Shin Megami Tensei: Persona 3 Portable’\n\nThe Persona spinoff series that falls underneath the Shin Megami Tensei franchise umbrella has always (and still!) enraptures us every time a new entry is unleashed. Shin Megami Tensei: Persona 3 Portable (which you can actually play now on damn near every past- and current-gen console!) is one of the best entries in the demon-hunting, social link-building JRPG chronology. The dark misadventures of the Specialized Extracurricular Execution Squad (SEES) got even better through this PSP release - this update allows players to select an alternate female protagonist, take control of every active party member, and guard against incoming enemy attacks.\n\nBuy Now, $499.95\n\n9. ‘Wipeout Pure’\n\nThe futuristic hovercraft racing games hailing from the Wipeout series will always have a special place in our hearts. And when it sped onto the PSP, we all got treated to one of the best portable racers we've ever played. Wipeout Pure has a bunch of key winning factors, which include its majestic visuals, a huge content suite (this game got hella DLC content, which definitely helped!), and the same incredible slock racing mechanics the series is beloved for. Wipeout Pure is one of the prettiest and super delightful PSP racers.\n\nBuy Now, $20.93\n\n10. ‘Tekken 5: Dark Resurrection’\n\nTekken 5 is already a top-quality fighting game on PS2. But once it got the PSP port treatment, it got a big boost in the form of new characters, stages, and music. Tekken 5: Dark Resurrection blessed us with the debut of the wealthy gymnastic fighter Lili and the military commander Commando Sambo user that are now franchise staples. Armor King II also pops up here to round out one of the best rosters in Tekken history. When you bring up all that and consider just how dope-looking the altered stages are and how catchy the new tunes are, you quickly realize this handheld 3D fighter truly is.\n\nBuy Now, $64.99\n\n11. ‘Metal Gear Solid: Portable Ops’\n\nThe espionage action that made us fall in love with Metal Gear Solid 3: Snake Eater got turned into a handheld spinoff that focuses on recruitment and teamwork. The addiction we once had when it came to putting randoms to sleep and eventually turning them into future squadmates is unparalleled. Tackling tough missions as a part of a four-man squad is certainly harrowing since the threat of permadeath is always in the air. The single-player component and the online-multiplayer component make this a smashing success for the MGS series on handheld devices.\n\nBuy Now, Price Varies\n\n12. ‘Metal Gear Solid: Peace Walker’\n\nMetal Gear Solid: Peace Walker arrived on the PSP with the finest elements of every MGS game that was released up until that point. And because of that approach to development, this handheld spec-ops mission for Snake aka \"Big Boss\" is classic franchise material. Ruling over Militaires Sans Frontières (Soldiers Without Borders) means taking on two mission types that deliver some of the best combat/stealth scenarios in the series. \"Outer Ops\" and \"Co-Ops\" will always be a part of our favorite bits from this PSP original.\n\nBuy Now, Price Varies\n\n13. ‘Ape Escape: On the Loose’\n\nApe Escape on the PS1 is among the long list of awesome platformers that exist on Sony's first home console. And thank the lord that Sony decided to remake it for the PSP. Ape Escape: On the Loose features some minor enhancements here and there - the newly added \"Enemy Book\" made things a bit easier for us when it came to cataloging all the bad guys we confront. Overall, the same awesome monkey-catching gameplay that blew our minds in the original is all here and accounted for. The music definitely still slaps, too!\n\nBuy Now, $6.11\n\n14. ‘Kingdom Hearts Birth by Sleep’\n\nTrying to make sense of Kingdom Hearts' confounding chronology is a lost cause at this point. All we know about Kingdom Hearts Birth by Sleep's plot is that it takes ten years before the first game in the series. Once we figured that whole deal out, we fell in love with the enhanced battle mechanics that fan-favorite characters Terra, Aqua, and Ventus master along their adventures across various Disney-themed planets. Swinging our Keyblades, blasting Heartless with the \"Shotlock\" command, and pulling off sick \"D-Link\" finishers all define why we love this game's combat so much.\n\nBuy Now, Price Varies\n\n15. ‘Patapon’\n\nIf there's one thing you can count on when it comes to Sony Interactive Studio's many first-party game makers, it's that they'll come up with something wholly unique at some point. Pyramid and Japan Studio joined forces to craft one of the quirkiest yet incredibly charming rhythm games of all time. Patapon puts you in the position of an invisible god-like figure who's responsible for adding tons more confidence to your followers. And that's done by commanding them all to perform all sorts of actions to the beat of a drum. The music here is great and we feel the exact same way about its distinctive art style.\n\nBuy Now, $11.99\n\n16. ‘Daxter’\n\nJak's human buddy that got turned into a slick-talking ottsel got to take on a fun job in his solo PSP venture - pest exterminator. The self-titled Daxter is a pretty cool platformer with all the humor you'd expect and fun collect-a-thon gameplay Jak and Daxter fans got a kick out of. We regularly return to this one thanks to its movie spoof-inspired dream sequences - Daxter's wild minigame takes on the likes of The Matrix Reloaded and Raiders of the Lost Ark are done so well.\n\nBuy Now, $47\n\n17. ‘Lumines: Puzzle Fusion’\n\nTetris walked so Lumines could run. The PSP's most prized puzzler will always be this one. The simple act of moving around descending two-colored 2×2 blocks to create 2×2 squares, then watching them get cleared out by an approaching line while a catchy rhythm blares in the background elicits pure joy. Even more good vibes come from changing the music and upping the clearing line speed to add new elements to each addictive puzzle playthrough.\n\nBuy Now, $13.38\n\n18. ‘Jeanne d'Arc’\n\nThe PSP sure had its fair share of quality RPGs and strategy games. From those genres comes another one of the best PSP games that happen to be developed by Level-5 (makers of Dragon Quest VIII and the Professor Layton series). Jeanne d'Arc uses the legend of the great Joan of Arc and plays out her struggles against the English occupation of France in turn-based combat form. If Final Fantasy Tactics is your jam, then this latest pick on our list should fascinate you.\n\n19. ‘Tactics Ogre: Let Us Cling Together’\n\nThe second entry in the classic strategy RPG series known as Ogre Battle never got localized for the SNES during its 1995 launch. Thankfully, the PSP got a top-tier remake of that Square Enix release in the wonderfully named Tactics Ogre: Let Us Cling Together. Besides its enhanced visuals, this remake improves upon the original's already amazing grid-based combat mechanics. Strategy RPG fans most definitely need to check out Tactics Ogre: Reborn, which is a modern-day remaster of this quintessential strategy RPG.\n\nBuy Now, Price Varies\n\n20. ‘Ys Seven’\n\nNihon Falcom is best known for its long-running action RPG series that's recognized for placing Adol Christin in the role of conquering hero. The seventh Ys game comes off so well on the PSP's handheld format - utilizing an array of melee weapons during furious fights against all sorts of monsters is a fast-paced affair that looks and feels great on Sony's portable gaming format. The surprisingly tough boss fights in Ys Seven are what truly tested our mettle and make us appreciate this game that much more.\n\nBuy Now, $179.99\n\n21. ‘Disgaea: Afternoon of Darkness’\n\nDisgaea: Hour of Darkness wowed strategy RPG fans with its anime art style, outlandish battle damage, and humorous themes throughout. The remake of that PS2 classic came out even better with the release of Disgaea: Afternoon of Darkness. When this game's multiplayer was still live, this game provided us with the most fun thanks to its combat between dueling parties. The addition of new battles against familiar characters, plus some extra story elements regarding an alternate timeline focusing on Etna are two more reasons why this PSP remake is beloved.\n\nBuy Now, $52.99\n\n22. ‘Mega Man Powered Up’\n\nChibi Mega Man is so easy on the eyes! And he and the rest of the robots that originated in the first game in the series came back here in a refreshed take on the \"Blue Bomber's\" first crusade against Dr. Wily. Mega Man Powered Up is a fun take on the series thanks to its abundance of Challenge Mode stages and the level editor that let us craft our very own punishing stages. Taking down those famed Robot Masters all over again in Chibi form still hits us right in the nostalgia feels.\n\nBuy Now, Price Varies\n\n23. ‘Mega Man Maverick Hunter X’\n\nMega Man X had a lot of young gamers in a chokehold when it originally dropped on the SNES. The same could be said for us when this PSP remake of that very same game arrived in 2006. Mega Man Maverick Hunter X not only does a phenomenal job of refreshing Mega Man X's first struggle against the \"Mavericks,\" but it also introduces a second playable character in the form of X's foe named Vile. Running around with that mysterious purple bot and blasting enemies out of the sky with his shoulder rocket launcher always makes us feel like a boss.\n\nBuy Now, $32.96\n\n24. ‘Crisis Core: Final Fantasy VII’\n\nThe ending to this Final Fantasy VII sequel will always bring a few tears to our eyes. And that's because of the journey Zack Fair embarks on as a SOLDIER 1st Class in one of the best PSP games and action RPG experiences on Sony's handheld. Crisis Core: FF7 lets players play through Zack's battles against random monsters and SOLDIER defectors in a game that breaks down the unforgivable sins of the Shinra Electric Power Company. Swinging that Buster Sword around and unleashing spiffy cinematic super moves were awesome then and they're even more awesome now in Crisis Core Final Fantasy VII Reunion.\n\nBuy Now, $51.91\n\n25. ‘Every Extend Extra’\n\nEvery Extend Extra looks, plays, and sounds like Rez made sweet, sweet love to Fantavision. What's presented here is a clever mashup between a puzzler and a shoot 'em up. Your ship only has the capacity to blow itself up, which in turn causes other ships to explode and cause a chain effect that raises your high score to epic proportions. Once you get your timing down pat and detonate at the perfect moments, you'll fall into a trance the more you play Every Extend Extra.\n\nBuy Now, $14.35\n\n26. ‘Half-Minute Hero’\n\nOne of the best PSP games that mash up a bunch of our favorite genres is this super quirky timed experience called Half-Minute Hero. What makes it such an anomaly is how it pushes its players to complete varied styles of gameplay (which include an RPG, real-time strategy, shoot 'em up, and action/adventure) with only 30 seconds on the timer for each one. This game's novel approach to progression always kept us on our toes and eyeing the clock as we tried to become as powerful as possible as the simply named \"Hero\" or go crossbow crazy with the \"Princess.\"\n\nBuy Now, $26.99\n\n27. ‘Castlevania: The Dracula X Chronicles’\n\nIt may have taken an excruciatingly long time to get Castlevania: Rondo of Blood ported over to American shores, but it was all worth it in the end since it got the 2.5D remake treatment. And on top of getting access to that refreshed version of a Konami side-scrolling, demon-busting classic, this pick on our list of the best PSP games comes with the original localized version of that aforementioned game and a remastered version of the GOAT known as Castlevania: Symphony of the Night.\n\nBuy Now, $75.34\n\n28. ‘Valkyria Chronicles 2’\n\nThe themes of war, young soldiers, and togetherness are strong in the first Valkyria Chronicles. And they're damn sure kept intact for the sequel that surprisingly launched on the PSP first. Valkyria Chronicles 2's mixture of third-person combat and tactical movement is top-notch, plus its specified class systems and optional character missions offer so much more to explore when it comes to character customization and a meaningful story. When we first made our way through this one, we definitely put the \"Armored Tech\" class to good use.\n\nBuy Now, $99.99\n\n29. ‘Dissidia 012 Final Fantasy’\n\nWe love Dissidia Final Fantasy, so of course we got our money's worth once that game's remake/prequel dropped. Dissidia 012 Final Fantasy adds in even more of our favorites from the franchise and lets us engage in the types of battles that we're used to seeing during the 3D games' grand cinematics. Lightning, Vaan, Laguna Loire, Yuna, Kain Highwind, and Tifa Lockhart join the roster here to take part in a shockingly epic campaign filled with major story reveals that hit harder than you'd expect.\n\n30. ‘Burnout Legends’\n\nBurnout Legends brings together the best parts of the first three games and feels like the ultimate version of the sadly defunct racing game series before Burnout Paradise launched. In handheld form, nothing is truly sacrificed here in comparison to the home console renditions - the face-melting speed, impactful \"Takedowns,\" and wild crashes that grabbed our attention back on the home console versions get replicated here in fine form on the PSP.\n\nBuy Now, Price Varies\n\n31. ‘Syphon Filter: Dark Mirror’\n\nMost folks know development studio Bend Studio is most associated with its PS4/PC zombie survival game Days Gone. But before it delved into post-apocalyptic adventures on a motorcycle, it focused on aspects of espionage and spec-ops with the Syphon Filter games. And when we're talking about the best PSP games, we have to mention the handheld entries in that franchise. First up is Syphon Filter: Dark Mirror, which brings Gabe Logan and Lian Xing back for some intense running, gunning, and hiding. Being able to shoot around corners and hide against walls in a single-player and multiplayer setting in this game makes it feel so much better than its PlayStation and PlayStation 2 predecessors.\n\nBuy Now, $10.99\n\n32. ‘Syphon Filter: Logan's Shadow’\n\nThe follow-up to the last game on our list does everything that title does and does it even better. Anyone who's played this sequel immediately peeped how much more realistic the shooting looks when it comes to taking down your enemies and interactions with objects in the world look. The sneaking and melee options also got expanded, which helps Syphon Filter: Logan's Shadow stands out as our most preferred entry in the (sadly defunct...) IP that Bend Studio birthed on the PS1. The multiplayer modes in this game (especially \"Rogue Agent!\") were pretty solid when the servers were still active.\n\nBuy Now, $21.47\n\n33. ‘Ratchet & Clank: Size Matters’\n\nInsomniac Games handed over the baton to its Ratchet & Clank series over to development studio High Impact Games for this fun series spinoff that has us looking down at our PSP screen until our necks ache. Ratchet & Clank: Size Matters features all the zany weapons and slapstick humor of the PS2 games, plus the space combat of Ratchet & Clank: Going Commando and the addition of \"Giant Clank\" provided a fun new element to that style of play. Those \"Dual Lacerators\" held us down the most in this game!\n\nBuy Now, $19.99\n\n34. ‘Final Fantasy Tactics: The War of the Lions’\n\nFinal Fantasy Tactics is strategy RPG royalty and the best way to experience that classic trip to Ivalice is via this well-received PSP update. Final Fantasy Tactics: The War of the Lions' battle system gives players access to a strong formation of character jobs to master in order to prevail during epic encounters that play out like nail-biting chess matches. The well-tuned character customization and combat systems are this game's strongest features, but we're also quite fond of its wonderful soundtrack and crisp 2D art style.\n\nBuy Now, $40.09\n\n35. ‘LocoRoco 2’\n\nFor those that played the Katamari Damacy games to death, then we're betting those same fans loved every part of the first LocoRoco. By the time that game's sequel arrived, the splendid animated visuals, cheerful music, and merrymaking platforming gameplay stayed as great as we remembered them in the past. LocoRoco 2 adds to its predecessor's most likable features and expands on them through the ability to squeeze through tight spaces and finally go swimming. The simple control scheme and camera maneuvering make this quirky PSP platformer a joy for all types of gamers, no matter their skill level.\n\nBuy Now, $124.99\n\nONE37pm may receive affiliate revenue from some of the links in this article.\n\nDid you like this article?\n\nLiked\n\nDisliked"
