Shadow Hearts Playable ? Minor Issues Works perfectly. Use RECVX emu for full speed gameplay. NTSC-J using RECVX emu works good, at first glance, however, the models will randomly change colors and generally glitch for reasons unknown. Lotteries will hang. Otherwise works perfectly, cleared fully with good ending. You can't get secret Fusion Monster soul for lotteries not working. Shadow Hearts: Covenant Unplayable Unplayable Unplayable Stops after PS2 logo, PAL: Black screen after FMV. [SLUS21041 crashes after selecting New Game] (known in Japan as Shadow Hearts II [シャドウハーツII]). NTSC-J boots no problem, plays the cutscenes and all, but blackscreens on first location load(actual gameplay). The game doesn't hang and music plays, but the screen is black and no reactions to any button presses.\n\ncreating the pkg with --vu1=jit-sync in config allows the level to load, but you will be out of bounds, and unable to move. Also causes strange graphical glitch on the screen with some random model always being there. The game probably can work normally, but requires a lot of research of emulator settings required for it.\n\nShadow Hearts: From the New World ? Playable ?

International versions are unplayable after the player gets to the second ladder in the Assembly of Nihilo, where the prompt for climbing down the ladder never shows up. Otherwise, the game also suffers from minor flickering that doesn't affect the experience (English translated version of \"Maniax Chronicle Edition\" freezes after a few minutes of play).
