        "text": "ü§î Another Sony PSP 2 rumor is circulating online\n\nüëè The handheld will reportedly be able to play PS4 games\n\nüëç Sony will want to ensure its handheld stands out from the competition\n\nüÜö The rumor comes amid talks of an Xbox handheld\n\nA new PSP 2 rumor has emerged that gives us a better idea about the power of Sony‚Äôs next PlayStation Portable.\n\nA report on Resetera by Russian journalist Anton Logvinov, who was one of the first to reveal that PlayStation exclusives would be coming to PC years before it was officially confirmed, said that Sony‚Äôs PSP 2 will be able to run PS4 games.\n\n‚ÄúBy the way, I can confirm that Sony is preparing a new PSP for release, but damn - there are only PS4 games in the launch lineup, which are generally available on PC, and therefore Steam Deck,‚Äù said Logvinov. ‚ÄúRetail chains, by the way, are quite skeptical. Either Sony is doing something completely, or they are still keeping secrets from their partners.‚Äù\n\nThe fact you can play many of the best PS5 games on PC, and therefore Valve‚Äôs Steam Deck, could make a PlayStation Portable 2 a hard sell for some. But the vast majority of console gamers will simply see the PlayStation logo and choose Sony‚Äôs device over a handheld gaming PC.\n\nIf Sony can open up the entire library of PS4 games to players, that could also give the handheld hundreds of games at launch.\n\nEither way, Sony will also want to make sure it‚Äôs handheld stands out from the competition. It could offer perks such as cloud saves, allowing you to take your progress with you when you‚Äôre finished playing on PS5, or Remote streaming, similar to the PlayStation Portal. Whatever it‚Äôs planning, though, it will want to get these six things right with the next PlayStation Portable.\n\nThere‚Äôs clearly a demand for a new PSP that can play games natively. Sony‚Äôs first foray into the handheld market was a success, selling over 80 million units. However, it struggled to find an audience with the PS Vita, which only managed to sell around 10 to 15 million units.\n\nAfter the runaway success of the Nintendo Switch, handhelds are back in a big way. Microsoft has been testing the waters to see whether consumers would like an Xbox handheld, and the Nintendo Switch 2 is due out next year. Sony will want to ensure it doesn‚Äôt miss the boat if handhelds continue to take off in the next few years."
