        "text": "It may have finished a distant second to the Nintendo DS in terms of worldwide sales, but the PlayStation Portable was far from a failure for Sony fans. Gorgeous to look at and packing some serious power under the hood, the Sony PSP was blessed with some of the biggest names in games, including Metal Gear Solid, Ridge Racer, Final Fantasy and Tekken.\n\nGiven that so many people chose the DS back in the day, it's fair to say that the console is ripe for rediscovery; here are 10 PSP games you simply have to sample if you decide to give the console a chance today.\n\nRidge Racer\n\nSony's hardware has a strong connection with Namco's Ridge Racer – many consider the PlayStation conversion of the arcade original to have been instrumental in selling the 32-bit system to the masses – and the arrival of the PlayStation 2 was accompanied by the equally brilliant Ridge Racer V.\n\nWhen the PlayStation Portable hit stores shelves in Japan in 2004 it was almost a given that it would have its own Ridge Racer, and it was one worth buying the console for. Boasting amazing visuals, loads of courses and the trademark drift-heavy gameplay, plain old Ridge Racer (yes, that is the title) was the ideal game to show off to your mates and make them feel bad about sticking with their puny Game Boy Advance.\n\nWipEout Pure\n\nAnother leading PlayStation brand, WipEout took pride of place in the PlayStation Portable's launch lineup with this astoundingly polished anti-grav racer. From the moment you witness the impossibly polished rendered introduction sequence – complete with an original track composed by Orbital's Paul Hartnoll – you know you're in for a treat. The combat racing action which made the franchise so famous is all present and correct, as is the incredible sense of speed and a soundtrack packed with famous names and blistering beats. The equally brilliant WipEout Fusion followed shortly afterwards, and both are worth your time.\n\nRelated\n\nFinal Fantasy Tactics: War Of The Lions\n\nThis turn-based strategy title actually has more in common with the Tactics Ogre series than Square's famous Final Fantasy franchise, and it's one of the finest examples of the genre thanks to its deep and rewarding gameplay, gorgeous visuals, stirring soundtrack and surprisingly mature and engaging plot. This PlayStation Portable update is based on the 1997 PlayStation original and adds in stunning animated cut-scenes and expands the 4:3 aspect ratio to a fill the console's 16:9 widescreen display. Slot this UMD into your PSP and you'll be enraptured for many weeks to come.\n\nMonster Hunter Freedom Unite\n\nCapcom's Monster Hunter series is one of its most lucrative thanks to a fanatic fanbase in Japan, but it was this 2008 portable offering which really gave the franchise serious recognition in the west. The objective is to hunt down and slay massive beasts using a wide range of different armour and weapons, and the mobile nature of the PSP is embraced by the fact that you can team up with other players and tackle missions co-operatively. Monster Hunter is perhaps more closely associated with Nintendo's line of consoles these days, but that will never change the fact that it was Sony's handheld which gave the series its first taste of portable freedom.\n\nMetal Gear Solid: Peace Walker\n\nArguably one of the best handheld games ever made, Peace Walker is a fully-fledged entry in the Metal Gear saga comparable in scope to any of the home console entries. Taking place after the events of Metal Gear Solid 3 and before Metal Gear Solid 5, Peace Walker is one of the most technically demanding PSP releases and packs a gripping, epic storyline as well as robust multiplayer options. It was updated for the PlayStation 3 in the Metal Gear Solid HD Collection, but it works best as a portable title.\n\nPrincess Crown\n\nPorted from the Sega Saturn original – and quite lazily, it has to be said – Princess Crown was exclusive to Japan but thanks to the region-free nature of the PSP is playable on western systems. This side-scrolling action RPG is the precursor to the likes of Odin Sphere and Dragon's Crown, and despite the large amount of Japanese text, it’s quite easy to enjoy and appreciate. While the conversion lacks any additional features, those hand-drawn graphics really pop on the PSP's screen, and the Street Fighter-style battle sequences haven’t lost their ability to excite.\n\nGod Of War: Chains Of Olympus\n\nThroughout the early life of the PSP, there was always doubt that the console could truly deliver the kind of epic experience players were used to seeing on home consoles. That all changed in 2008 when Sony released God of War: Chains of Olympus, a stunning action title which was a close match visually to Kratos's blood-soaked adventures on the PlayStation 2. In terms of pure gameplay, the gap was even closer – this stands as one of the best entries in the entire God of War franchise, which is high praise indeed.\n\nPatapon\n\nWith its marching characters and puzzle elements, Patapon is half rhythm action, half god sim. You control a tribe of cute-looking creations who respond to various button sequences. Learning these combinations is all part of the challenge, and it's strangely addictive to see your button pushes translate into drumming in the game, which in turn drives your plucky people forward. Thanks to its appealing art design and engaging gameplay Patapon comes highly recommended; it's also worth checking out its two PSP sequels, as well.\n\nRelated\n\nBurnout Legends\n\nWhile it is considered to be a spin-off from the main Burnout series, Burnout Legends manages to capture all the thrills, spills and (above all) wanton destruction that makes Criterion's series so popular. Featuring a horde of modes – including standard races, elimination events and even a Chase HQ-style pursuit challenge – Burnout Legends is a pocket-sized companion to the likes of Burnout 3: Takedown and Burnout Revenge, and loses very little in the transition to the smaller screen. To make PSP owners feel even better about their purchase, the DS version of Legends was terrible in comparison.\n\nLumines\n\nHandheld consoles and puzzle titles go hand in hand; the Game Boy had Tetris and the Game Gear launched with Columns. When the PSP arrived it was accompanied by Lumines, the brainchild of former Sega designer Tetsuya Mizuguchi. The block-clearing gameplay doesn't seem revolutionary at first glance, but it's the way that the music connects with the on-screen action that really gets the pulse racing. A sequel followed in 2006 and more recently the game has been released on smartphones, but it's the PSP original which is perhaps the most fondly remembered by fans."
