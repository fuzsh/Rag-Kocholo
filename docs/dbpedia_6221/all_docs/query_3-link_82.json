        "text": "Our comprehensive PSP games on PS5 list lets you know exactly which classic portable games are available on PS5, PS4, and PS Plus with trophies.\n\nLee Brady\n\nPublished 05 Aug 2024\n\nFollowtopics\n\nPlayStation PlusTrophy ListLee Brady\n\nPS Plus Premium subscribers now have a veritable treasure trove of classic trophies to collect thanks to the service's ever-growing PSP games on PS5 list. Below, we've listed all of the PSP games on PS5 and PS4 with trophy lists, the vast majority of which have platinum trophies to help incentivize you.\n\nEvery PSP game with trophies available on PS5 and PS4\n\nEmulated PSP games started showing up on PS5, PS4, and PS Plus Premium in 2022, and since then we've received a steady trickle of new ports every month or so. While not every PSP game on PS5 and PS4 has a platinum trophy, the vast majority do, so there's a good chance you'll have trophy to hunt in your favorite PSP classic.\n\nCheck out the full list of PSP games on PS5 and PS4 below!\n\nApe Academy 2\n\nHere are the Ape Academy 2 trophies\n\nPS5 and PS4 release date: March 2023\n\nTrophy list difficulty: 2/10\n\nMuch like the first game in this series, this Ape Escape minigame compilation spin-off is a fun time-waster, though not exactly something you should be going out of your way to revisit on PS5 and PS4. It does come with a remarkably easy platinum trophy to collect, so that's something, but perhaps check out the original Ape Escape instead?\n\nApe Escape Academy\n\nHere are the Ape Escape Academy trophies\n\nPS5 and PS4 release date: October 2023\n\nTrophy list difficulty: 2/10\n\nThis PSP minigame compilation certainly possess the wacky charm of the Ape Escape series, but its hardly what I'd call a must-play game on PS5 and PS4. The platinum trophy here is pretty easy, so if you're a PSP trophy hunter, this could help kill a few hours. Otherwise, either check out the slightly more feature-rich sequel or just play a full Ape Escape game on PS Plus Premium.\n\nApe Escape On The Loose\n\nHere are the Ape Escape On The Loose trophies\n\nPS5 and PS4 release date: August 2023\n\nTrophy list difficulty: 2/10\n\nI'll be honest with you — before I played Ape Escape On The Loose, I thought the concept of it sounded dreadful. A remake of the first Ape Escape game minus all the analog stick gimmicks that make the original game so iconic? It sounds bad on paper, but upon playing this one, I found it just as fun as the PS1 classic. Those original Ape Escape levels are just a good time! Plus, you can nab this platinum in just a few hours.\n\nBlade Dancer Lineage of Light\n\nHere are the Blade Dancer Lineage of Light trophies\n\nPS5 and PS4 release date: May 2023\n\nTrophy list difficulty: 4/10\n\nBy today's standards, Blade Dancer is a pretty sluggish RPG to revisit on PS5 and PS4, which makes it a hard recommend for anyone looking for a retro JRPG to sink their teeth into. However, the plot does have its moments and the visuals are pretty good for the PSP, so it's worth checking out if you're a massive genre aficionado. Keep in mind that this platinum trophy will prove to be a little more taxing than other games on this list simply by being a massive time sink.\n\nCoded Soul\n\nHere are the Coded Soul trophies\n\nPS5 and PS4 release date: June 2023\n\nTrophy list difficulty: 3/10\n\nI would love to tell you a little more about this PSP JRPG, but unfortunately the PS Plus version of Coded Soul is only available to Japanese subscribers. Looking over the trophy list here, it all seems pretty straightforward, but that's hardly going to help us poor Westerners who can't access the game on PS5 or PS4.\n\nDaxter\n\nHere are the Daxter trophies\n\nPS5 and PS4 release date: June 2024\n\nTrophy list difficulty: 3/10\n\nThis solo spin-off for the little \"ottsel\" with the big mouth is an absolute blast from the past and a sizeable platforming adventure all on its own terms. To unlock Daxter's PSP platinum trophy, you'll need to explore every inch of the game and take part in every side adventure and minigame. Still, it's a delightfully well realized Jak and Daxter spin-off, so absolutely check it out on PS5 and PS4!\n\nEchochrome\n\nHere are the Echochrome trophies\n\nPS5 and PS4 release date: June 2022\n\nTrophy list difficulty: 4/10\n\nThis PlayStation puzzler still feels charming and unique by today's standards, so if you're on the hunt for a PSP game with some meat on its bones, this would be my recommendation. In Echochrome, you're tasked with solving perspective puzzles that draw upon the works of MC Escher. Some of these can get pretty tricky too, so you might need a guide handy if you're going to gun for the game's platinum trophy.\n\nEchoshift\n\nHere are the Echoshift trophies\n\nPS5 and PS4 release date: July 2022\n\nTrophy list difficulty: 4/10\n\nThis sequel to Echochrome takes the same perspective puzzle idea and twists it with a whole new set of gimmicks and additions to further break your brain. It can get pretty hard at times, so if you want to make the hunt for Echoshift's game's platinum trophy, just make sure to have a guide handy.\n\nGravity Crash Portable\n\nHere are the Gravity Crash Portable trophies\n\nPS5 and PS4 release date: July 2023\n\nTrophy list difficulty: 4/10\n\nThis fast-shooting action arcade hit still feels just as good to play today, so if you're looking for a PSP game to get addicted to on PS5 and PS4, this is the one to go for. Those trophies will require a little bit of skill to unlock as well, although remember that you have a rewind button at your disposal.\n\nJak and Daxter The Lost Frontier\n\nHere are the Jak and Daxter The Lost Frontier trophies\n\nPS5 and PS4 release date: March 2024\n\nTrophy list difficulty: 4/10\n\nThis divisive entry in the Jak and Daxter franchise might not have Naughty Dog's seal of approval, but it's still fun to see these characters again after such a long time. The platinum trophy here won't be the easiest — tricky flying missions make it a pain to collect everything. Still, if you're a fan of the series, this PSP spin-off is a must.\n\nJeanne d'Arc\n\nHere are the Jeanne d'Arc trophies\n\nPS5 and PS4 release date: July 2024\n\nTrophy list difficulty: 5/10\n\nThere are a bunch of reasons why you should check out the excellent PS Plus Premium release of Jeanne d'Arc — after all, it is a massively overlooked gem in the PSP games catalog. That said, one key reason is also to pick up that fairly reasonable platinum trophy, which mercifully won't waste your time too much.\n\nSure, you'll have to get invested in all the bonus stages to collect all these PSP trophies, but this tactical RPG is so good you'll probably be doing that anyway!\n\nKillzone Liberation\n\nHere are the Killzone Liberation trophies\n\nPS5 and PS4 release date: June 2023\n\nTrophy list difficulty: 3/10\n\nThe oft-overlooked first portable spin-off in the Killzone series might not have the budget or the first-person camera controls seen in the later portable Killzone Mercenary, but it's still a good time. In Liberation, you play as the protagonist of the first game on a new mission, all of which is present from an overhead camera angle. It's a fun portable shooter, if a little dated, and its platinum trophy should unlock pretty easily for you.\n\nKingdom of Paradise\n\nHere are the Kingdom of Paradise trophies\n\nPS5 and PS4 release date: September 2022\n\nTrophy list difficulty: 2/10\n\nAlso known as Key of Heaven, this PSP action RPG actually does have some pretty fun gameplay if you don't mind a bit of repetition in your combat! The trophy list isn't too tricky either — just invest yourself in doing everything and you'll have that platinum trophy in no time. It's a great one for switching your brain off and just have a chill time collecting trophies on PS5 and PS4.\n\nLocoRoco Midnight Carnival\n\nHere are the LocoRoco Midnight Carnival trophies\n\nPS5 and PS4 release date: July 2022\n\nTrophy list difficulty: 3/10\n\nAll of the LocoRoco games are an absolute delight, and LocoRoco Midnight Carnival is no exception. While it might not have the clean and crisp graphics of the PS4 LocoRoco remasters, it's still a fun experience for fans of the series. The platinum trophy won't prove too challenging either, although you might need to replay a few levels just to get all your little crazy blobs in order.\n\nMediEvil Resurrection\n\nHere are the MediEvil Resurrection trophies\n\nPS5 and PS4 release date: August 2023\n\nTrophy list difficulty: 3/10\n\nIf you're looking to play MediEvil on PS Plus, you could do a little worse than the PSP version of the game. While it can be a little troublesome with its lack of a right analog stick, the game still feels very much like the MediEvil we all know and love. Plus, it's a pretty simple one to platinum — don't forget you can revisit levels when you have all those power-ups unlocked!\n\nNo Heroes Allowed\n\nHere are the No Heroes Allowed trophies\n\nPS5 and PS4 release date: July 2022\n\nTrophy list difficulty: 4/10\n\nNo Heroes Allowed is a pretty tricky strategy/base defense game which, I have to say, plays a lot better than a lot of these PSP ports on PS5 and PS4. You'll find the trophies here a little harder to earn than most games on the list too, although it's also probably one of the more rewarding games to pick up and play.\n\nPinball Heroes\n\nHere are the Pinball Heroes trophies\n\nPS5 and PS4 release date: December 2022\n\nTrophy list difficulty: 2/10\n\nStep back in time to the PS3 era of PlayStation, where franchises like MotorStorm and Uncharted ruled the roost. In Pinball Heroes, you can experience some fun little pinball tables themed after big PlayStation IP. It's perhaps one of the easiest platinum trophies Sony has ever released, which makes it an easy recommendation to those looking to round out their collection of PSP platinum trophies.\n\nPursuit Force\n\nHere are the Pursuit Force trophies\n\nPS5 and PS4 release date: May 2023\n\nTrophy list difficulty: 3/10\n\nOne of the most underrated action games on the PSP, Pursuit Force can be a really enjoyable time so long as you don't feel like comparing it to any modern titles. The game is a pretty simple shooter with some really fun vehicle sections where you leap from car to car arresting and shooting fools. It's also a pretty simple platinum trophy to earn, so why not revisit this one?\n\nPursuit Force Extreme Justice\n\nHere are the Pursuit Force Extreme Justice trophies\n\nPS5 and PS4 release date: August 2023\n\nTrophy list difficulty: 3/10\n\nJust like the first game in the series, Pursuit Force Extreme Justice offers some excellent and underrated PSP action to play on your PS5 and PS4. This time around, the setpieces are even crazier — there's a whole hoverboat chase scene! It's a great time and it's an easy platinum trophy to unlock, so check this one out.\n\nRatchet and Clank Size Matters\n\nHere are the Ratchet and Clank Size Matters trophies\n\nPS5 and PS4 release date: July 2024\n\nTrophy list difficulty: 3/10\n\nWhile this might not be the best Ratchet and Clank outing in the franchise's long history, it's still a perfectly enjoyable romp with your favorite lombax and defective killbot. Plus, there really is no better past time on PS5 or PS4 than collecting Ratchet and Clank platinum trophies, so we're thrilled to see this PSP port get trophy support.\n\nIf you're only used to playing the most recent Ratchet and Clank games, then you might be surprised by how involving this trophy list is. It's still a relative breeze for ardent trophy hunters, but you'll need to unlock all the in-game skill points to access the High Impact Treehouse. That's a feat that will require some effort — or a walkthrough. Besides that, though, this platinum is a piece of cake.\n\nResistance Retribution\n\nHere are the Resistance Retribution trophies\n\nPS5 and PS4 release date: February 2024\n\nTrophy list difficulty: 2/10\n\nWhile it lacks the precision and care of its mainline console cousins, Resistance Retribution is still a worthwhile experience if you're a big fan of this dormant PlayStation IP. The platinum trophy here is an absolute breeze to earn, plus its just fun to shoot Chimera no matter how compressed the graphics are.\n\nSuper Stardust Portable\n\nHere are the Super Stardust Portable trophies\n\nPS5 and PS4 release date: June 2022\n\nTrophy list difficulty: 4/10\n\nThis arcade shooter from the immeasurably talented folks at Housemarque still feels just as great to play today as it did when it released. That's not something that can be said about even half of the PSP games on this list! The platinum trophy for this one can be a little bit trickier, but remember you have a Rewind button if you need a little help.\n\nSyphon Filter Dark Mirror\n\nHere are the Syphon Filter Dark Mirror trophies\n\nPS5 and PS4 release date: March 2023\n\nTrophy list difficulty: 2/10\n\nGabe returns to duty in this PSP follow-up to the beloved PS1 action franchise. While a little bit darker and also a bit less memorable than the last PS1 Syphon Filter game, Dark Mirror still has a lot to offer for fans of PSP games. Plus, it's another simply platinum from the series. All you have to do is beat the campaign and this PSP platinum is yours!\n\nSyphon Filter Logan's Shadow\n\nHere are the Syphon Filter Logan's Shadow trophies\n\nPS5 and PS4 release date: May 2023\n\nTrophy list difficulty: 2/10\n\nThe very last of Gabe's adventures (for now), Syphon Filter Logan's Shadow continues the solid work started by Dark Mirror on PSP. It's a fun action game and it has all the mature violence that was weirdly removed from the game's PS2 version! The platinum trophy here is also pretty easy — just beat the game and this will unlock for you.\n\nThrillville\n\nHere are the Thrillville trophies\n\nPS5 and PS4 release date: December 2023\n\nTrophy list difficulty: 2/10\n\nAt first glance, we thought the trophies for Thrillville looked a little intimidating. However, as it turns out, this theme park sim is a breeze to platinum! Since you don't have to complete any missions or even deal with the final park, you can directly target every challenge on the trophy list without worrying about playing the game 'correctly.' That makes Thrillville one of the easiest PSP platinums available.\n\nToy Story 3\n\nHere are the Disney Pixar Toy Story 3 trophies\n\nPS5 and PS4 release date: June 2024\n\nTrophy list difficulty: 2/10\n\nWhile not as enjoyable as the PS1 take on Toy Story 2, the PSP game Toy Story 3 is still a pretty enjoyable time for fans of these old movie tie-ins. You're still playing as Buzz, wandering around large environments looking for things to collect. The platinum trophy will be the real draw here — you can take unlock this one after just a few hours of gameplay.\n\nPSP games on PS5 lacking trophy support\n\nWhile the Toy Story 3 PSP platinum trophy revealed that third-party PS1 trophy support could be a possibility, there are a few PSP games on PS5 and PS4 that have yet to receive any trophies. All of the games listed below can be played on PS5 and PS4, but don't expect to earn any platinum trophies for doing so.\n\nCheck out the list of PSP games without trophy support below.\n\nDisney Pixar Up\n\nGods Eater Burst\n\nLego Star Wars 2 The Original Trilogy\n\nRidge Racer 2\n\nSoulCalibur Broken Destiny\n\nTekken 6\n\nThrillville Off the Rails\n\nBetween these PSP games and the full PS1 games list of titles that feature trophy support, you have plenty of options on PS Plus Premium for some classic trophy hunting! Let us know in the comments if you plan to earn any of these PSP platinum trophies above!\n\nWritten by Lee Brady\n\nStaff Writer Lee keeps one eye on the future (Astro Bot), one eye on the past (PS1, PS2, and PS3 games), and his secret third eye on junk he really likes (Final Fantasy, Kingdom Hearts, Sonic).
