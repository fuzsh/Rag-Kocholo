        "text": "This page gives details on the DVD releases of the Harry Potter film series. Sections include:\n\nIntroduction to DVD and Blu-Ray Versions of the Films\n\nOther Versions of the Films: VHS, VCD, HD, and UMD\n\nHarry Potter and the Sorcerer’s Stone\n\nHarry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets\n\nHarry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban\n\nHarry Potter and the Goblet of Fire\n\nHarry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix\n\nHarry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince\n\nHarry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 1\n\nHarry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 2\n\nIntroduction to DVD and Blu-ray Versions of the Films\n\nThe official website for the DVD and Blu-ray version releases is Warner Home Video. While this site gives summary information on the various editions available – Regular, Blu-ray, Ultimate, Box Sets, Gift Sets – probably IMDB is the best source of information on various edition release dates for the films on DVD alone – widescreen, full screen, box sets, and gift sets. So many DVD editions/releases have appeared over the years for the same film that it gets very convoluted. Go to the movie page for the specific film you are interested in, and at the very bottom of the page you’ll find a link called “dvd details” in the section called “Related Products.” Then you can select the particular edition you’re interested in from the pull-down menu, and it will generally give both the edition name and release date.\n\nThe Blu-ray website is far better if you want to find specific details on the special features of each film quickly. Search for “Harry Potter” and you’ll get a listing of all Blu-ray versions available: Regular, Ultimate, Box Sets. Then, each individual film offers such details as:\n\nSection with:\n\nImage of package front\n\nDistributor\n\nYear the film was released\n\nLength of main feature\n\nRating\n\nRelease date for the Blu-ray edition\n\nVideo\n\nAudio\n\nSubtitles\n\nNumber of discs\n\nRegions\n\nBundles (e.g., if packaged with other items in box sets or gift sets)\n\nPrice\n\nBlu-ray Rating\n\nPopularity\n\nCommunity\n\nBelow that summary section is a box with tabs to select with:\n\nOverview description\n\nBlu-ray review\n\nScreenshots\n\nUser reviews\n\nRegion coding\n\nNews\n\nForum\n\nNear the bottom of the page, you’ll find a “News and Update” section. It gives links to press releases and other information about that specific film, and others in the Harry Potter series. A good source for content lists of special features is the Blu-ray site. Check out the Blu-ray “News” section, and the individual film edition pages.\n\nHP1 and HP2 Ultimate Editions – Sorcerer’s Stone and Chamber of Secrets. (This press releases has the full listings of features, as well as other important information, such as how many minutes of additional scenes have been integrated into the “extended” version of the films.)\n\nHP3 and HP4 Ultimate Editions – Prisoner of Azkaban and Goblet of Fire. (This listing is not as extensive as the one for HP1 and HP2, but still contains some useful details.)\n\nBlu-Ray Regular Edition Release Dates\n\nHarry Potter and the Sorcerer’s Stone – December 11, 2007\n\nHarry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets – December 11, 2007\n\nHarry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban – December 11, 2007\n\nHarry Potter and the Goblet of Fire – December 11, 2007\n\nHarry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix – December 11, 2007\n\nHarry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince – December 08, 2009\n\nHarry Potter and the Deathly Hallows (Part 1) – April 15, 2011\n\nHarry Potter and the Deathly Hallows (Part 2) – November 11, 2011\n\nBlu-ray Ultimate Edition Release Dates\n\nHarry Potter and the Sorcerer’s Stone – December 08, 2009\n\nHarry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets – December 08, 2009\n\nHarry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban – October 19, 2010\n\nHarry Potter and the Goblet of Fire – October 19, 2010\n\nHarry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix – June 14, 2011\n\nHarry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince – June 14, 2011\n\nHarry Potter and the Deathly Hallows – ??

(No release date publicized yet.)\n\nOther Versions of the Films: VHS, VCD, HD, and UMD\n\n[Images forthcoming.]\n\nIntroducing the Changes in Media Systems\n\nWe have been in a media transition for decades into increasingly digital modes of delivery as the standard. (For some background history on this topic, check out the Wikipedia article on DVD.)\n\nWith sound, this has progressed from vinyl records and reel-to-reel; to eight-track; to cassette tape; to standard CD (compact disc); to enhanced CD/CD-ROM with additional content features and items (like posters, links to websites video clips); to DVD (digital videodisc) and digital editions that greatly expand on the capability of the media, the quality of the sound and mix, and delivery system options (computer, Walkman, iPod, etc )..\n\nWith video, this journey has included the fight between the higher-quality Beta format versus the more popular VHS (Video Home System) format – with VHS the winner; to the laserdisc that was the size of a vinyl record; to DVD; to the fight between HD (High Definition) and Blu-ray formats for enhanced quality of picture and sound; to various forms of digital copies that allow for playing of standard definition or high definition video on various delivery systems from personal computers to smart phones to videogame systems.\n\nAlong the way, VCD (Video Compact Disc) has always been a lesser-known but ever-present cousin to the standard video delivery systems available. VCD typically seems more prominent where personal computers are more common than expensive high-definition and digital equipment. The compact disc capacity being so much less than what’s on a DVD, this meant that a movie that would fit on one DVD usually is split across three VCDs. The smaller capacity also meant few add-on features would fit. So, usually a VCD set has perhaps a movie trailer or two, plus maybe a few featurettes.\n\nHarry Potter Movies on Obsolete and Obscure Media\n\nIn my research to put together the pages on DVD/Blu-ray, I did what I could to figure out how some of the other types of media were used and then discarded over the years. Here’s what I’ve been able to find out so far.\n\nVHS Cassettes. The VHS format was still in wide use during the early part of the 2000 decade. So, VHS editions of the first three movies were produced: Sorcerer’s/Philosopher’s Stone (VHS released in 2002), Chamber of Secrets (2003), and Prisoner of Azkaban (2004). The most common versions on eBay and Amazon are English, Spanish, and French – along with the less-frequently-found UK PAL format editions. VHS versions of For Your Consideration “Awards Screeners” were also available for at least the first two films, to promote the movies to those in various professional fields who would be voting on Academy Awards and the like.\n\nVCD Sets. VCDs are generally found outside North America, most often in Asian markets, and secondarily in Europe and the Middle-East. So, details are harder to figure out. But I have acquired a VCD set for Chamber of Secrets, so I’m assuming VCDs were also produced for at least Sorcerer’s/Philosopher’s Stone. This particular set is bilingual English/Cantonese with Chinese subtitles. In my searches on eBay, I’ve also run across a set of four promotional postcards from Singapore with the slogan, “Own the magic on DVD and VCD!”\n\nHD Discs. There were HD editions produced for only the first five films, and in 2007, the Years 1-5 Gift Set was produced with an HD option as well as in standard definition DVD and high definition Blu-ray. All five were produced as single-disc HD editions, with Order of the Phoenix also issued as a”Combo Pack” of HD plus DVD. HD editions are distinguished by a deep burgundy plastic “clamshell” cases, just as Blu-ray cases are distinguished by that specific color of medium blue and regular DVDs usually by black or white.\n\nUMD Discs. All eight Harry Potter films are available in UMD editions for the PSP PlayStation Portable system. UMD reputedly has similar quality of at least standard DVD.\n\nTo my knowledge, no Harry Potter films were ever produced on Beta cassette or laserdisc; those formats had already passed from the scene.\n\nHarry Potter and the Sorcerer’s Stone\n\nHP1 ~ DVD Bonus Disc Special Features\n\nNever-before-seen footage (7 deleted scenes)\n\nSelf-guided 360-degree tour of Hogwarts\n\nInterviews with director Chris Columbus and producer David Heyman\n\nCast a spell over a scene in 8 languages\n\nMix potions, perform transfigurations, sneak past Fluffy, explore Diagon Alley, have a wand choose you, Catch a Snitch – learn how to play Quidditch, meet the ghosts of Hogwarts, and more\n\nTheatrical trailers\n\nDVD-ROM PC Features:\n\nCollect Wizard trading cards\n\nBe Sorted by the Sorting Hat\n\nDownload screensaver and Remembrall\n\nReceive owl e-mails\n\nLink to the web\n\nBlu-ray Description\n\nFrom J.K.
