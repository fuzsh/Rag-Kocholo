        "text": "ShareCompleted\n\nMicosteri\n\n50%Emulated\n\n4h Played\n\nThe best Harry Potter game yet, but still lacking in quite many departments like overall world building. I liked the upgrades to combat, traveling and flying. Also really enjoyed the new potions mini game. Even still this will be the last \"main\" Harry Potter game of the saga I will play, due to the last two being boring third person shooters and the first 3 only being dungeon crawling. So Hogwarts Legacy here I come!\n\nShareCompleted\n\ndorkman3092\n\n40%Wii\n\n4h 52m Played\n\nWorst of the HP games yet. More a collection of mini games that you walk and watch cut scenes in between. OK the first time, but having to repeat the same 3 over and over was tedious. Motion controls were crappy as well. Luckily it was very short.\n\nShareCompleted\n\nSingis111\n\n30%PC\n\n2h 59m Played\n\nHarry Potter and the Half blood Prince the game is just as dull and boring as the movie its based on. Graphics looks ok, but the animations for everything are just lazy and repetitive. It plays similarly to Order of the Phoenix, except now there's pointless mini-games. Among them are Quidditch, which sounds exciting but it's just flying through stars until its over. And the potions mini-game I used to really like but it just tired me out.\n\nIt's a lazy and boring game, but the one thing that the game has that the movie doesn't is the good music. The music is really good, even if most of the songs are reused from older games, especially the jazz rendition of Hedwig's Theme.\n\nShareCompleted\n\nchocletychip\n\n70%Wii\n\n7h Played\n\nFinally a more polished game (after 4 and 5). However, kind of short and repeating the same 3 activities over and over. And over."
