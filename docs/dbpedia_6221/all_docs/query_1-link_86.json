        "text": "The best open-world games for PS5 and PS4 include Red Dead Redemption 2 and Marvel's Spider-Man 2, but also other remarkable games available on PS Plus.\n\nKes Eylers-Stephenson\n\nPublished 03 Aug 2024\n\nFollowtopics\n\nPlayStation 4PlayStation 5Kes Eylers-Stephenson\n\nUpdate: After years of magnificent updates and free support, No Man's Sky has made it to the list of the best PS5 open-world games. Go and explore, below!\n\nThe best open-world games for PS5 and PS4 also happen to be some of the best titles on PlayStation consoles. So, we've narrowed them down to 21 open-world games playable on PS5 — from Horizon Forbidden West to Hogwarts Legacy — and have made a particular focus on those with the most interesting game worlds and spaces.\n\n21 best open-world games to play on PS5 right now\n\nThis list has been curated by the TrueTrophies team — Editor Kes and Staff Writers Lee and Sean. We have experience in every game listed below and have combined that knowledge with community ratings and review scores to give it a place on the list. All games playable on PS5 qualify: native PS5 titles, backward-compatible PS4 games, and anything available through your PS Plus subscription.\n\nOpen-world isn't a genre per se, but a descriptor of the game format. In short, we're looking for the most interesting game worlds that are free to explore. That means we are putting a big emphasis on how unique the places and spaces you journey through are and how that weaves with narrative, gameplay, and environmental design.\n\nHere are the best open-world games on PS5.\n\n21. Forspoken\n\nRelease Date: January 24, 2023\n\nDeveloper: Luminous Productions\n\nIs it on PS Plus? No\n\nIs that a freaking 7/10 game on our beloved best PS5 open-world games list? Look, hate on Forspoken all you want for its abysmal dialogue (and I encourage you to do so); at the end of the day, it's an abundantly generous open-world game. Movement and action in this game feel incredible — just check out Sean's Forspoken review if you don't believe me.\n\nIt's a shame that the dialogue was so dreadfully managed here as to turn people thoroughly off the game. I do have a quick fix for you, though. Simply go to the audio options and switch the language from English to Japanese. I promise Frey and her standoffishly quippy nature become more palatable in the Superior Nihongo. Make the switch and have fun learning spells and gliding over this wonderful PS5 exclusive open-world!\n\n20. GhostWire Tokyo\n\nRelease Date: March 25, 2022\n\nDeveloper: Tango Gameworks\n\nIs it on PS Plus? No, it was removed from PS Plus Extra in March 2024\n\nI know Staff Writer Sean has a real deep love for this Tango Gameworks open-world after collecting all those GhostWire Tokyo trophies. It's a little lower down this list because the open world doesn't exactly push the boundaries of this style of game. However, it does give us a haunting, abandoned, neon-lit Tokyo to wander around.\n\nIt's a good chance to explore some freaky Japanese mythology in the empty streets of Tokyo and it's not short on weird and unsettling vibes. Plus, if you get caught up in its collection style of completionism, you'll end up having explored every concrete slab in Tokyo. I highly recommend giving GhostWire Tokyo a chance to freak you out!\n\n19. Days Gone\n\nRelease Date: April 26, 2019\n\nDeveloper: Bend Studio\n\nIs it on PS Plus? Yes; PS Plus Extra\n\nIf you haven't embarked on collecting the Days Gone trophies yet, where have you been? This underrated game from the PS4 era is still playable on PS5, and we think you should give it a go! With the story of biker Decon St. John at its core, you'll be shooting at freakers (zombies) as you ride your motor through Oregon forests and the wildernesses beyond. The gameplay loop is compelling and it feels good and meaty to play, especially when a huge hoard comes after you.\n\nAmongst the best PS4 games we voted Days Gone higher than Kingdom Come Deliverance, but those positions have swapped for the best open world list. Why? Well, we think that the Oregonian world of Days Gone is gloriously open and wild, but doesn't quite have the depth of the aforementioned medieval RPG. By no means take that as a slight, though. I think it's a glorious game with American story-telling cheesiness and bombast — I love it!\n\n18. Stellar Blade\n\nRelease Date: April 26, 2024\n\nDeveloper: Shift Up\n\nIs it on PS Plus? No\n\nWhile you are having the time of your life hacking and slashing your way through the many Naytiba in Stellar Blade, there is also a fantastic open world to rummage through. Stellar Blade separates its open world into sections, which I find to be so much more manageable as I get burnt out rather easily when having to explore sprawling open worlds with no end in sight. In particular, having released around the same time as the broad, endless, vastness of Dragon’s Dogma 2, Stellar Blade understands restraint can make for a great open world.\n\nHowever, with Shift Up separating the open world into segments, each area feels fun and fresh to explore. I honestly enjoyed searching every nook and cranny trying to grab all the collectibles, finishing all the side missions, and uncovering the open world's many secrets. I explored every inch of Stellar Blade’s open world twice to grab all of those glorious Stellar Blade trophies and never once felt bored or fed up.\n\n17. Assassin's Creed Mirage\n\nRelease Date: November 15, 2013 (PS4)\n\nDeveloper: Ubisoft Montreal\n\nIs it on PS Plus? No\n\nWhile it may not be particularly high up our best Assassin's Creed game rankings for a reason, Baghdad was a real saving race of Assassin's Creed Mirage. In previous generations, you could've easily slotted in Assassin's Creed Unity's masterful Paris cityscape or Assassin's Creed Black Flag's Caribbean seas. I don't think Baghdad is quite at that level as its parkour and sense of uniqueness aren't quite on the same scale.\n\nHowever, if you do pursue the Assassin's Creed Mirage trophies, you'll find the city to be light and gaudy. It's gorgeously put together and feels like a real slice of life compared to the RPG trilogies' cities. With Arabian being spoken in the streets, distinct districts to explore, and a good amount of verticality — I do recommend a quick exploration!\n\n19. No Man's Sky\n\nRelease Date: November 11, 2020 (PS5), August 9, 2016 (PS4)\n\nDeveloper: Hello Games\n\nIs it on PS Plus? No\n\nThe No Man's Sky trophies are well worth your time exploring space for now it's on PS5 and barely resemble the initial game. Its exploration is terrific and the soundtrack that accompanies it will blow your mind and visceral colors sweep by the sides of your spaceship.\n\nWith exciting flora and fauna, interesting planetary designs, and more to do and customize than ever — No Man's Sky is truly one of the most ambitious open worlds on this list!\n\n15. Hogwarts Legacy\n\nRelease Date: February 10, 2023 (PS5), May 5, 2023 (PS4)\n\nDeveloper: Avalanche Games\n\nIs it on PS Plus? No\n\nIt was a bit of a surprise that in 2023 a game could dominate like Hogwarts Legacy did. But, dominate it did, and for good reason! The recreation of Hogwarts is one of my favorite parts of an open-world map I've ever seen and bursts at the seams with the innovative magic systems presented by Harry Potter.\n\nWith tight, twisting castle corridors and an open courtyard dominated by twisting towers, there is something so special about the place. That feeling is heightened with brilliant music and the mumblings of students, teachers, and moving paintings as you wander the corridors. There is much more than that, of course.\n\nOn your voyage through the Hogwarts Legacy trophies you'll discover interesting characters like the morally compromised Sebastian Sallow. You'll also get to explore the rich Scottish Highlands with their odd villages and damp caves filled with magical creatures. I think the game gets a little lost during the main story, but everything else is here to round out a great package — strong gameplay, creative ideas, and fun side missions. Hogwarts Legacy is a great open-world game for PS5 players!\n\n14. Death Stranding\n\nRelease Date: November 8, 2019 (PS4), Sepember 24, 2021 (PS5)\n\nDeveloper: Kojima Productions\n\nIs it on PS Plus? Yes, PS Plus Extra\n\nDeath Stranding isn't everyone's cup of tea. You play Sam Porter Bridges (Norman Reedus) as he delivers parcels to help reconnect America after it is broken by a cataclysmic event. The line between life and death is now blurred and the results are horrifying — something legendary game designer Hideo Kojima explores with his typical complexity, silliness, and absurdity.\n\nA character named Die Hardman? Sure, mate... sure. But some of the characters like Fragile (Lea Seydoux), Clifford Unger (Mads Mikkelson), and Mama/Lockne (Margaret Qualley) are impeccably written. Ultimately, you are delivering parcels from one place to the next. The game part comes from the voyages you make to and fro, over mountains and chasms, through snow and river, or crowds of strange creatures as acidic rain falls overhead.\n\nWith bikes, trucks, grapples, and cannons to help you negotiate the empty American landscape with your deliveries, you'll find an open-world game that is gorgeous and unique, and certainly something I've never seen anything like before. The environment is the game and that is truly innovative to me. You might think it pretentious and rubbish or you might end up loving it like me, but isn't it worth finding out?\n\n13. Final Fantasy VII Rebirth\n\nRelease Date: February 29, 2024\n\nDeveloper: Square Enix\n\nIs it on PS Plus? No\n\nWhile some open-world games like to dump you into their sandbox and let you have your fun, I’ve always been more interested in the games that slowly dish out their world in chunks. Sure, it means you can’t just jump on the nearest horse and head for the sunset, but I think it’s better for open-world games that also want to pace out a solid story.\n\nFinal Fantasy VII Rebirth pulls off this style of open-world gameplay beautifully, in my opinion. You can get lost doing side quests and messing around for hours at a time, but you never just abandon the story for days at a time. Eventually, you’ll max out everything there is to do in a certain area (at least on your first pass) and need to press on and see what’s next.\n\nWhat’s next also usually happens to be another stunning chunk of open-world gameplay to enjoy, so it’s a win-win for both story-focused gamers and anybody who just likes to get lost in a game. If you’ve read my Final Fantasy VII Rebirth review, you’ll also know I think the rest of the game is pretty incredible too. So, if any of that sounds appealing, you should check out those Final Fantasy VII Rebirth trophies.\n\n12. Dragon’s Dogma 2\n\nRelease Date: March 22, 2024\n\nDeveloper: Capcom\n\nIs it on PS Plus? No\n\nDragon’s Dogma 2’s open world is filled with mysteries and nightmarish terrors to uncover. From a huge humanoid sphinx that will ask you to complete its riddles, to a terrifying Medusa who wants to turn you to stone, something is always lurking around the corners of DD2.\n\nIn fact, Dragon’s Dogma 2 wants nothing more than for you to explore its huge world and get absorbed into all of the little stories. It feels like there is more of a focus on exploring than on the main story (which is still a lot of fun). The open world is where almost all the fun is to be had and I loved delving into all the different caves and scouring the areas for treasure (that I would usually end up selling). Capcom has left no stone unturned by designing a beautiful world for you to wander around.\n\nThose Dragon’s Dogma 2 trophies will also reward you for exploring every nook and cranny you can. You’ll need to find Seeker Tokens, solve riddles, acquire materials, snatch weapons, explore the different vocations, and slay dragons to earn the platinum trophy ‘The True Arisen.’ Are you ready for the challenge?\n\n11. The Elder Scrolls V Skyrim\n\nRelease Date: November 11, 2011 (PS3), October 28, 2016 (PS4), November 11, 2021 (PS5)\n\nDeveloper: Bethesda Softworks\n\nIs it on PS Plus? Yes, PS Plus Extra\n\nWhen you think of massive and immersive open worlds, we would be shocked if Skyrim wasn't one of the first games to pop into your mind. The game is impressive even on PS5. There is so much content to uncover that you can get lost in the world for hours on end as you stumble across side-quests, secrets, and caves filled with enemies to slay. It's an absolute marvel to play and a game that still holds up all this time later.\n\nI had so much fun earning all those The Elder Scrolls V Skyrim trophies (three times thanks to the PS5 version) and spent two months playing nothing but Skyrim. I was enthralled with its world and all of the different lives I could play out in the same game. I remember running around the world finishing odd jobs and didn't even progress the main storyline for dozens of hours. There aren't many games that allow you to focus on anything but the main story and reward you for it. It's Skyrim for goodness sake, just give it a go.\n\n10. Kingdom Come Deliverance\n\nRelease Date: February 13, 2018 (PS4)\n\nDeveloper: Warhorse Studios\n\nIs it on PS Plus? No\n\nBohemia, 1403. King Wenceslaus IV rules as he is under siege from his half-brother and Hungarian King Sigismund. Open on the historically accurate town of Skalitz where we find our mighty hero, Henry. There he is, doing such heroic things as... dodging work, getting drunk, and running around with his mates while his village gets burned to the ground? Wait, now he's trying to learn to read... and how to hold a sword without accidentally slicing his toes off. My word, Henry is a silly boy!\n\nThis realistic RPG is, for our money, the most underrated game of the PS4 generation. You'll take silly peasant Henry from life as a Blacksmith's son to life under the arm of true knight Sir Radzig. Teaching Henry everything is one of the most rewarding gameplay loops I've ever experienced. The world is a glorious recreation of the medieval Czech Republic and the narrative is one of the most captivatingly earnest in all of video gaming — it's funny because Henry doesn't quip (he bumbles), it is emotional because love was put into every character, and it's exceptional because it is modest.\n\nSure, you'll put loads of time into the Kingdom Come Deliverance trophies and have to replay it a few times, but you won't mind. Add in DLC that has finished the game's story and a fair amount of bugginess, this isn't the most AAA experience on this list. But, if I am being honest dear reader, it's the open-world game I love the most. If it wasn't for reason and objectivity, it'd be even higher!\n\n9. Horizon Forbidden West\n\nRelease Date: February 18 , 2022 (PS5, PS4)\n\nDeveloper: Guerrilla Games\n\nIs it on PS Plus? Yes, PS Plus Extra\n\nI wrote in my Horizon Forbidden West review that this game is the most technically beautiful I've ever experienced when played on PS5. I still believe that. From decrepit cities being swallowed by sand with cavernous waterholes resting underneath, to snowy hill villages fortified by cliffs and big stone walls, Horizon Forbidden West is a satisfying game to explore.\n\nIt helps that the lighting is stunning, the small environment tells like ferns moving from beneath you giving it liveliness, and that Aloy physically reacts to the environment. The game also has a really strong story even if the central protagonist doesn't quite engage you in the way she should.\n\nThe RPG-lite does run into issues with the HUD and isn't trying to reinvent the Ubisoft-style open world — but it does refine everything to a tee. Throw in an unbelievably good combat model featuring giant robot dinosaurs, and there is no reason you shouldn't try and platinum the Horizon Forbidden West trophies.\n\n8. Like A Dragon Infinite Wealth\n\nRelease Date: January 26, 2024 (PS5, PS4)\n\nDeveloper: Ryu Ga Gotoku Studio\n\nIs it on PS Plus? No\n\nSomeone was going to do horrible things to us if we didn't mention that choosing to platinum the surprisingly easy Like A Dragon Infinite Wealth trophies is one of the best experiences you can have on PS5 right now. Set in Hawaii this time, you'll be getting your hands back on Ichiban Kasuga's saga which duking it out in a palm tree-coated shirt in a refined turn-based combat system. If the Yakuza series has a reputation for greatness before, then Infinite Wealth has somehow stepped the game up again.\n\nThat odd storytelling that grips you and refuses to let go? It's got that again and it's got you in a chokehold this time. That side-content feast is back and as liberatingly insane as ever. Hawaii is genuinely a gorgeous setting with scale, density, and charm, but make no mistake that returning Japanese settings make this the most complete open-world of the Yakuza games, too. I can't recommend the game to you anymore. If you like Yakuza, hop right in!\n\n7. Ghost of Tsushima\n\nRelease Date: July 17, 2020 (PS4), August 20, 2021 (PS5)\n\nDeveloper: Sucker Punch\n\nIs it on PS Plus? Yes, PS Plus Extra\n\nSucker Punch has the traditional open-world formula down to a tee. Explore, collect, do a bit of story, and then explore some more. That's how the inFamous games did it, and that is how the wonderful Ghost of Tsushima does it, too. Unlike Horizon Forbidden West — its open-world PlayStation exclusive counterpart — the game set in Feudal Japan offers a few small twists on the formula.\n\nFirstly, the island of Tsushima (and Iki Island if you play the DLC) is a landscape that feels different for a Western audience. With long rushes swaying in the wind and small Japanese farmsteads providing real architectural contrast to the usual fair. As we covered in our Ghost of Tsushima review, though, it also uses the environment to its advantage. You'll be guided by the wind towards objectives which reduces the clutter from the menus.\n\nIn doing so, the world seems larger and more immersive because you aren't living your digital life guided by a glowing point on the screen. It's subtle and perfect. If you do go for all those Ghost of Tsushima trophies, then you'll find fantastic combat and a really strong narrative to boot, rounding out the game into the perfect package.\n\n6. Cyberpunk 2077\n\nRelease Date: December 10, 2020 (PS4), February 15, 2022 (PS5)\n\nDeveloper: CD Projekt Red\n\nIs it on PS Plus? No\n\nWhile Cyberpunk 2077 may have had a rocky start, things have changed dramatically since launch and CDPR has worked hard to make Cyberpunk the best version of itself possible. Now, the dystopian metropolis of Night City is filled with content and reasons to explore it. The world is deliriously vibrant and perilously full of life, constantly tearing on the edge of insanity. This odd allure kept me engaged from start to finish. Practically, it's a fantastic world to explore and it is made even more fun with the ability to parkour everywhere with your cyber enhancements.\n\nI was skeptical going into Cyberpunk 2077 but within the first five minutes the game reassured me that all of the issues of the past were just that, distant memories of a buggy mess. Nothing beats taking down the various Cyberpsychos, using your enhanced abilities to annihilate foes, and finishing up engaging side-quests. There is a lot to enjoy in Cyberpunk 2077 and don't even get us started on how awesome the recent expansion is.\n\nEarning every one of the Cyberpunk 2077 trophies along the way (which I did) is one of the best gaming experiences in recent memory, so if you're still sleeping on this epic open world title — what are you waiting for? Jump into it now!\n\n5. Grand Theft Auto V\n\nRelease Date: September 17, 2013 (PS3), November 18, 2014 (PS4), March 15, 2022 (PS5)\n\nDeveloper: Rockstar North\n\nIs it on PS Plus? No\n\nPicking Grand Theft Auto V is categorically boring. Sorry! Do you know why it's here, though? Even 10 years after its release Los Santos remains one of the most vibrant contemporary open worlds put together. As it satirically skewers every aspect of the American world — from its hyper-capitalism to its surface-deep entertainment industry — GTA V also gives you everything else. Satisfying driving? Check. Good gunplay? Sure. A brilliant story? Of course.\n\nI mean, no doubt the Grand Theft Auto V trophies will make you want to put your head through a wall. But when the wall is this well-made, why not? The GTA Online mode is genuinely decent so long as you hide your wallet away and we can't stress enough how much enjoyment you can have just mucking about. So, go on! Have some fun by picking up our most 'boring' pick if you somehow haven't yet!\n\n4. Marvel's Spider-Man 2\n\nRelease Date: October 20, 2023 (PS5)\n\nDeveloper: Insomniac Games\n\nIs it on PS Plus? No\n\nSpider-Man 2's open-world recreation of New York City does things differently from other games. It doesn't exist simply to enhance the player's sense of freedom — rather, it offers players a chance to express the unique movement of Spider-Man creatively through improvised routes and awkwardly shaped roadblocks. In essence, the world gives the player a giant obstacle course to navigate, and it turns the mere act of getting from A to B into a delightful gameplay skill of its own.\n\nWhere Marvel's Spider-Man 2 trumps its predecessors is in upping the video game elements of its open world with the addition of wind tunnels, vents, and Super Slingshots. These elements glow green in the game's HUD because the developers want you to see this open world more like a freeform race track than just another wide space that separates you and your objective. Zipping around always felt good in these games, but it's hard to imagine going back to the older games without Marvel's Spider-Man 2's Web Wings. So, head out and grab the Marvel's Spider-Man 2 trophies — you know you want to!\n\n3. Elden Ring\n\nRelease Date: February 25, 2022 (PS5, PS4)\n\nDeveloper: FromSoftware\n\nIs it on PS Plus? No\n\nWhile I enjoyed my time beating Dark Souls, I did not feel remotely inclined to play another game like it afterward. That was, at least, until I saw Elden Ring — an open-world game with a horse that could double jump. The game promised organic boss fights that would feel naturally integrated into a huge, diverse open world, and after playing the game to collect the Elden Ring trophies, I can say it delivered on that promise.\n\nThe constant risk and reward balance of exploring the world in Dark Souls is amplified magnificently in Elden Ring, letting the player tackle the game in whichever direction they want so long as they've got the skills. It's the ideal water cooler open-world game, as everyone who plays it comes away with their individual story to tell. Plus, despite being massive, The Lands Between doesn't feel boring to traverse due to all the variety out there. That, and the double-jumping horse, of course.\n\n2. The Witcher 3\n\nRelease Date: May 19, 2015 (PS4), December 14, 2022 (PS5)\n\nDeveloper: CD Projekt Red\n\nIs it on PS Plus? No\n\nSometimes, I sit back and just reflect on my times adventuring with Geralt through the fantasy world of The Continent. The Witcher 3 has a magical chemistry of superb writing, innovative high-fantasy, and well-paced gameplay that creates an unbeatable potion of all-time gaming glory.\n\nHowever, what I think separates CD Projekt Red's incredible fantasy RPGs from others like Dragon Age, Skyrim, and even Final Fantasy is that its open world is grounded. It uses landscapes that feel rooted in a world you know. That means it feels as though you could reach out and touch the sodden cliffs of the Skellige Islands, smell the rancid bogs of Crookback, or hear the bustle of university students in Oxenfurt.\n\nWith this tangible world operating in the background you get sucked in because, despite the magic, mutagens, and Gwent cards, it's all something relatable. So, when you also plug in characters that have these perfectly curated emotional arcs, wonderfully complex creatures with perfectly woven narrative context surrounding them, and deliciously underrated hardy Eastern European humor — the result embarrasses every other RPG I've played in the last 10 years. Those The Witcher 3 The Wild Hunt trophies are calling!\n\n1. Red Dead Redemption 2\n\nRelease Date: October 26, 2018 (PS4)\n\nDeveloper: Rockstar North\n\nIs it on PS Plus? Yes, PS Plus Extra\n\nIf you want to talk about a game that was released and just truly embarrassed everything else on the market by being an outrageously good and innovative game, look no further than grabbing the Red Dead Redemption 2 trophies and then we'll really be talking. As the Old West of America is falling to the slow industrialization of the frontiers, cowboy Arthur Morgan grapples with his role as part of the magnetic leader Dutch's gang.\n\nIt's so well written that it might be my favorite story in video gaming, but it almost certainly wouldn't be if the open world didn't push it up a notch. The story isn't just great because of the writing — it's how it interplays with the truly revolutionary environment design. You can interact with everyone and feel like part of this world. You'll come across random events in the forests and end up on a forty-minute journey that'll make you laugh and cry as you try and help a widow in need.\n\nYou'll see gorgeous views that will have you settling down for five minutes just to drink it in while you eat some meat you carved down the muddy way. Nothing you do feels arbitrary here — none of the missions feel grindy or frustrating. It all just feels like one true moment. The result is the best game I've played for a long, long time and one that I don't think I've recovered from yet. Red Dead Redemption 2 is the best open-world game you can play on PS5.\n\nThat is our list of the best open-world games!
