Please help the Harry Potter Wiki by adding notes and/or references to bring the page to a higher standard of quality.\n\nSince the success of the films, different gaming companies have produced several video games based on the Harry Potter series, most notably Electronic Arts (EA), Traveller's Tales (TT), and Portkey Games.\n\nWhile the LEGO Harry Potter games are sold on various markets, the Electronic Arts series is only available for discs/DVD distribution.\n\nElectronic Arts series[]\n\nIn 2001, gaming company Electronic Arts (previously known as EA Games) began releasing adaptations of each of Warner Bros. Harry Potter films, with a considerable respect to the original plot in the book franchise.\n\nAll videogames have been released with the exact titles its film counterparts have in the US. Versions for different platforms of the same title may differ severely; for example, the first two titles (Sorcerer's Stone and Chamber of Secrets) each have five completely unrelated versions by different developers, while the third title (Prisoner of Azkaban) has three. From the fourth title on, multiple versions of a single title across platforms are much more similar, but still have minor differences.\n\nHarry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone (2001)\n\nReleased for PC, Mac, PS1, PS2, Xbox, GameCube, GBC and GBA\n\nHarry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets (2002)\n\nReleased for PC, Mac, PS1, PS2, Xbox, GameCube, GBC and GBA\n\nHarry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban (2004)\n\nReleased for PC, PS2, Xbox, GameCube and GBA\n\nHarry Potter and the Goblet of Fire (2005)\n\nReleased for PC, PlayStation 2, Xbox, GameCube, PSP, Nintendo DS and GBA\n\nHarry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix (2007)\n\nReleased for PC, Mac, PS2, PS3, Xbox 360, Wii, PSP, Nintendo DS and GBA and Mobile\n\nHarry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince (2009)\n\nReleased for PC, Mac, PS2, PS3, Xbox 360, Wii, PSP, Nintendo DS and Mobile\n\nHarry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 1 (2010)\n\nReleased for PC, PS3, Xbox 360, Wii, Nintendo DS and Mobile\n\nHarry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 2 (2011)\n\nReleased for PC, PS3, Xbox 360, Wii and Nintendo DS and Mobile\n\nIn 2003, after the second game, Electronic Arts also released a Quidditch-focused game entitled Harry Potter: Quidditch World Cup.\n\nCast[]\n\nSee List of Harry Potter cast members.\n\nLEGO series[]\n\nFour titles of videogames based on LEGO Harry Potter toy series by the famous block-building toy company LEGO have been released. They feature LEGO toy versions of Harry Potter characters, places and items in cartoon-styled, speechless, often comedic animations, typical to LEGO videogames.\n\nDifferent companies have released these games in two occasions, one at the beggining of the film series and the other near its conclusion.\n\nLEGO Creator (2001-2002)[]\n\nIn 2001, Superscape produced a computer game based on LEGO Harry Potter building toy series: LEGO Creator: Harry Potter, which was published by LEGO subsidiary LEGO Media. The game was part of the LEGO Creator video game series.\n\nA sequel based on the second film, entitled Creator: Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets was produced by Warner Bros. Interactive in 2002 and also published by LEGO Media.\n\nThe two releases received much less attention in comparison to the concurrent Electronic Arts series, thus no more sequels in LEGO Creator Harry Potter series were lately published.\n\nLEGO Harry Potter (2010-2011)[]\n\nWith the film series about to conclude in 2010, LEGO re-acquired rights on the Harry Potter series and, together with its new toy sets, planned the release of a remastered video game based on the Harry Potter series. Traveller's Tales (TT) then produced LEGO Harry Potter: Years 1-4, as part of the LEGO video game series. Focusing on the first four years in the Harry Potter series, the game featured a very detailed and consistent gameplay, in addition to the original soundtrack used in the films.\n\nAfter the large success and positive reviews acquired by LEGO Harry Potter: Years 1-4, TT produced a sequel focused on the last three years of the series, entitled LEGO Harry Potter: Years 5-7, which also received good reviews.\n\nThe two games were published by Warner Bros. Interactive for most platforms.\n\nWonderbook series[]\n\nSCE London Studio, a subsidiary of Sony Computer Entertainment, released a PlayStation-exclusive game called Wonderbook: Book of Spells (or just Book of Spells) in 2012. Directly crediting J. K. Rowling rather than the film series, the game simulates spell learning with a wand, through the Book of Spells by Miranda Goshawk.\n\nA similarily-styled sequel entitled Wonderbook: Book of Potions (or Book of Potions), focused on Zygmunt Budge's Book of Potions, was released in 2013.\n\nHarry Potter for Kinect[]\n\nIn 2012, Eurocom developed a Xbox 360 game designed for the Kinect accessory based on Harry Potter films. The title was Harry Potter for Kinect. It consists mainly of minigames based on clips from the film series.\n\nPortkey Games series[]\n\nThe following games have been produced by Portkey Games:\n\nHarry Potter: Hogwarts Mystery (2018)\n\nReleased for Android, iOS\n\nHarry Potter: Wizards Unite (2019)\n\nReleased for Android, iOS\n\nHarry Potter: Puzzles & Spells (2020)\n\nReleased for Android, iOS, Fire OS, Facebook\n\nHarry Potter: Magic Awakened (2021)\n\nReleased for Android, iOS\n\nHogwarts Legacy (2023)\n\nReleased for PS4, PS5, Windows, Xbox One, Xbox Series X/S, Nintendo Switch\n\nHarry Potter: Quidditch Champions (2024)\n\nThis article or section is a stub.
