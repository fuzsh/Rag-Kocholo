because the architecture of those PlayStation 3 consoles made use of many similar or identical components as the PlayStation 2.\n\nSomewhere along the line, Sony discontinued the 20GB PlayStation 3 and replaced it with one that had a 40GB hard drive instead.\n\nThis led to a move away from PS2-based components as well, so the 40GB PlayStation 3 does not offer any backwards compatibility with the

growing and some titles may be removed in the future when the game is ported to another console.\n\nSome of these titles are conventional disc-based games that you would buy in a regular retail store, while other items mentioned in this PlayStation 3 game list are available for digital download through the PlayStation Network.\n\nThe great thing about digital downloads through services like PlayStation Network, Xbox Live Arcade, and Wii Virtual Console is that developers can take chances that they may not otherwise be able to take with conventional retail releases.\n\nIf you have spent a lot of time playing PlayStation 2 games, then you know that eventually you find yourself searching for PlayStation2 cheat codes websites.\n\nThe following are the most popular cheat code websites that devote a large portion of the site to people who are playing the PlayStation 2 game console.\n\nGame Winners is a less popular site than all of the big names listed above, however it does have an

this is one of the best PlayStation 3 games that must not be missed.\n\nThe Sonic series has spawned over 30 games released on the Genesis, Saturn, Dreamcast, GameBoy and DS consoles, PlayStation 2 and 3, Xbox/Xbox 360, the PC and even the Nokia N-Gage.\n\nThe home gaming system isn't as hot or as new as it used to be, but the PlayStation 2 still offers an incredible and diverse library of games to play.\n\nNow that the holidays are over, it is a much better time to buy a PlayStation 3 on eBay and not pay over the top prices.\n\nYou can also play original PSone games on the PS2, with some

PlayStation 3 and the Xbox 360.\n\nWhen the three consoles were first released the Wii was the cheapest of the three, with a PlayStation 3 costing up to $500.\n\nYou should be able to find it for fairly inexpensive because not only was it one of the greatest hits series for the PlayStation One, but it can probably be found in a used video games section at your local game store.\n\nIn this way, if you're looking to play PlayStation 2 games on a PS3, you will have the most success with these models.\n\nWith the introduction of the 80GB model, Sony re-introduced PS2 backwards compatibility to the PlayStation 3, but this does not work in the same way as the 20GB and 60GB PlayStation 3.\n\nThis means that the ability to play PlayStation 2 games is not based in the hardware or physical components of the PlayStation 3.\n\nIf you are having trouble with playing PlayStation 2 games, one of the best things you can do is to check if you have the latest version of the PS3 firmware.\n\nAs this article has explained, it depends on the exact model of PlayStation 3 that you have, but it also has to do with the specific PS2 titles that you would like to play as well.\n\nAs such, the video game graphics and renders aren't quite as crisp and detailed as the intense visuals you find on the current generation of video game consoles like the Sony PlayStation 3 and the Microsoft Xbox 360.\n\nOne of the most unique games I was able to play around with was \"The Eye of Judgement\" which is being designed for the Sony PlayStation 3.\n\nThe graphics aren't high-end like what you'd find on the Xbox 360 or PlayStation 3 (or even the PSP), but they suit this wonderful offering perfectly and are colorful and vibrant enough to keep a big wide smile on your face.\n\nDance Dance Revolution hit the arcades in 1998, but it took two more years before Konami ported it over to the Sony PlayStation.\n\nEven the Sega Dreamcast has a version of DDR, but you have to import it from Japan and the Dreamcast dance pads are a pain to find if you don't have the PlayStation to Dreamcast adapter.\n\nA game that is very similar to the hugely popular Dance Dance Revolution is In The

faced with the top selling game for the PlayStation One and the results were astounding.\n\nIf you are going to search for other PlayStation ROM sites, make sure they are legit and free of spyware.\n\nIf you are dubious about downloading ROMs from any sites that offer PlayStation ROMs, then considering joining a site that lets you pay a one-time fee to download unlimited ROMs.\n\nIf you own an Xbox 360 or PlayStation 3, for instance, you may be able to find free NFL Madden downloads to try.\n\nThere are many free online role playing multiplayer games . You don't need to have the latest computer hardware or own an Xbox or Playstation to enjoy these games.\n\nRumors are flying that the next Game Boy (Game Boy 2, as many refer to it) will be more like

make life easier for cheaters.\n\nEntering the sixth generation, bit-counts were no longer a matter of concern.Approaching the new millennium, we saw the ill-fated Sega Dreamcast, the DVD-running Sony

over to the PlayStation Network for the PlayStation 3 and the Wii Shop for the Nintendo Wii.\n\nYou will need the program Swap Magic or a Mod Chip, as well as a method to boot burned discs on your PlayStation 2.\n\nAnother major selling point is that the video game is available on a variety of systems, including the Xbox 360, PlayStation 2, PlayStation 3, and the Nintendo Wii.\n\nThere are still some issues being worked out for the PlayStation 3 and Nintendo Wii, but the Xbox 360 versions appear to be fully compatible.\n\nA November 8 release of Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire is scheduled for the PlayStation 2, Xbox, Nintendo GameCube, Nintendo DS, Game Boy Advance, and Windows PC.\n\nIn the mid 1990s, Sega launched a new system, the Sega Saturn, but it was overshadowed by Sony's entry into the console market with the Sony Playstation.\n\nThis was followed by the Sony PlayStation 3 (PS3) and the Nintendo Wii, both of which were released in the fall of 2006.\n\nOne major note on the Playstation was that Sony originally developed a CD-ROM peripheral for the SNES, but Nintendo pulled support for it and Sony decided to go on their own.\n\nIt's the holiday season and the most highly anticipated new Playstation 3 console has just been released, ushering a whole new holiday season of video game gift madness.\n\nFor anyone who travels a lot or likes their video games to

the Playstation in 1996, gave the genre a boost to the top that hasn't really died down much since.\n\nWhile its library may not be as vast as, say, the Sony PlayStation 2, the GameCube aims to provide quality over quantity... and let me tell you, it's got plenty of gems.\n\nFumbling through all of those UMD cartridges can be a bit of a hassle, so wouldn't it be easier if you could just download games directly to your PlayStation Portable?\n\nIt doesn't fully replace the need for regular UMD-style PlayStation Portable games, but it does open up the opportunity for new forms of fun and easy entertainment.\n\nAlthough some people experience Internet browsing problems on the PlayStation 3, the vast majority don't have too much trouble connecting the PS3 to a home Wi-Fi network.\n\nThere, you gain access to all sorts of content and interactivity, including the PlayStation Store.So, what does this have to do with downloading games to the PSP for free?\n\nGoing through the PlayStation Store on the PS3, you will find that there is content available for the Sony PSP.\n\nIn effect, the PlayStation 3 acts as a gateway and the content is then transferred to the PSP over a USB connection.\n\nIn late 2008, Sony issued a firmware update for the PSP that allowed the handheld to connect directly to the PlayStation Network and PlayStation Store, effectively bypassing the need to use the PS3 as an intermediary.\n\nWe do not condone this kind of practice, so we encourage you to stick to the PlayStation Store for the PSP.\n\nOn the PlayStation 2 and 3, you can use the EyeToy to enhance the Dance Dance Revolution games by using your hands.\n\nEven though many people have moved on to the Xbox 360 or PlayStation 3, there are still a lot of people out there who are interested in how to burn PS2 games.\n\nThe Sony PlayStation 2 is a much more affordable option than the current generation offerings and the massive library of existing games is a very big draw.\n\nIn this way, you could say that burning PS2 games falls into the same or similar legal gray area as PlayStation 2 emulators.\n\nOne of the main reasons why you may want to make backup copies of your PlayStation 2 games is because it can sometimes be challenging to fix scratched video games.\n\nThis guide on how to burn PS2 games will assume that you have a physical copy of the original game in your possession and not just a downloadable PlayStation ROM.\n\nJust like you can with the PlayStation 3, you can also search for redemption codes online through sites like eBay.\n\nKatamari Damacy is done in a very block-like cartoon style, which works well for the game, but doesn't exactly show off what the Playstation 2 is made of.\n\nThese player updates are free of charge and can be downloaded via the PlayStation Network or Xbox Live for the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360, respectively.\n\nNow in its 16th offering, Madden NFL 2006 can be found on nearly every video game console out there, including the Xbox 360, PlayStation 2, and Game Boy Advance.\n\nSo many parts of this game just come up short when compared to other RPGs available for the Playstation 2.\n\nWhile the Playstation 2 port is easily the least polished, it's still definitely worth picking up if you don't have a PC or an Xbox.\n\nMedal of Honor Airborne is scheduled for a release in the winter of 2006 for the PlayStation 3 and PlayStation 2 systems, Xbox 360 and Xbox systems and for the Windows PC.\n\nWhile first appearing in arcades in the 90s, the title really caught on with its port over to the Sony PlayStation and later on to the Game Boy Advance.\n\nMusic games have definitely made their mark in the US market, and with all the new innovations, it won't be long until your house contains a grand piano that's hooked into your Playstation 2.\n\nI'd imagine that the graphics on the Xbox 360 would be similar to the PS3 version of NHL 08, but if you opt for the cheaper PlayStation 2 version of the game, the graphics are probably nowhere near as good.\n\nThe following guide is for the Xbox 360 version, but the process is similar on the PlayStation 3 as well.\n\nSo when I saw the PlayStation 2 Namco Museum 50th Anniversary Collection, I just had to try it out.\n\nMost of the cheat codes mentioned in this article are for the Xbox 360, but the codes should work on the PlayStation 2 version as well; just swap out the Xbox 360 buttons for the corresponding buttons on the PS2 controller.\n\nThe cheat codes below are for the PlayStation 2 version of the game, but the title is also available on the Nintendo GameCube, Microsoft Xbox, and Windows PC.\n\nThis camera will be capable of video streaming to the forthcoming PlayStation 3 via Wi-Fi, and might be used for the upcoming HUB PlayStation service.\n\nWell, word on the street is that the next PlayStation Portable is going to have some built-in memory this time around.\n\nNot much else is known about the next PlayStation Portable as far as aesthetics, but it will likely look very similar to the current offering.\n\nAs part of the 32/64-bit generation of gaming machines, the Nintendo 64 was in direct competition with the Sony PlayStation and Sega Saturn, as well as the less successful Atari Jaguar and Panasonic 3DO.\n\nIn fact, many companies such as Sony (known for the popular PlayStation console series) and Microsoft (Xbox) have gone to great lengths to promote the security of their devices against emulators.\n\nTheir place in the market, however, has since diminished significantly, first with the introduction of the Sega Genesis, and later with the PlayStation, PlayStation 2, and Xbox.\n\nWhile nearly everyone has games for the Xbox and Playstation2, some sites do not carry games for the portable game systems or for the original Playstation.\n\nMost PlayStation cheats are not immediately obvious to the gamer, because they may involve a complex button combination at just the right moment.\n\nBetter still, this system opens up the opportunity to cheat in just about every PlayStation 2 game, regardless of whether the original video game programmers decided to include a method for unlimited health or unlimited ammo.\n\nMost people would look to the PlayStation 3 for its ability to play Blu-ray movies and some of the best video games, but the home gaming console is actually a fully functional entertainment machine as well.\n\nThe PlayStation 3 controller was never designed for typing long strings of text, so you are left with a less than stellar on-screen keyboard that can be quite difficult to use.\n\nThe only files that can be downloaded directly from the Internet onto the hard drive are files that the PlayStation 3 would be able to handle on its own.\n\nIt was previously released on PC and the Xbox 360, but it is now also a PlayStation 3 game, boasting improved graphics and sound.\n\nWhile the vast majority of gamers are well ensconced in the current generation of games on the Nintendo Wii, Xbox 360, and PlayStation 3, many still yearn to play the games from the previous generation.\n\nSince then, the PS3 has gone through several iterations that have adjusted some of its inner workings, including the size of the internal hard drive and its ability to play legacy PlayStation 2 games.\n\nJust as there are many versions of the original \"phat\" PlayStation 3, it would not at all be surprising if Sony decided to released multiple versions of the PS3 Slim at some point in the future.\n\nSince there are so many good PlayStation 3 games, the vast majority of people who are interested in the system likely will not need PS2 backwards compatibility.\n\nIn addition to the regular full retail releases of games on the PS3, the console also has access to a vast library of titles through the PlayStation Network in the form of downloadable content.\n\nThrough the PlayStation Network, or PSN for short, PS3 owners have the ability to purchase original content as well as versions of games that had been released in the past on other consoles.\n\nIs the skinnier version of the PlayStation 3 just as good as the original or are there certain sacrifices that must be made?\n\nWhile the original Sony PlayStation 3 started out as being the most expensive next-generation video game console when it launched in 2006, it also offered the most horsepower and the largest hard drive at the time.\n\nMoreover, the differences in specifications have not been provided by Sony, but some users have noticed that the PS3 Slim is slower than the regular PlayStation 3.\n\nThis assumes, of course, that you have already decided to buy a PlayStation 3 instead of an Xbox 360 or Nintendo Wii.\n\nWith the largest selection of PlayStation themes on the Internet, you'll surely be able to find something to fit your style.\n\nBefore you prepare a lengthy email, simply head over to the \"support\" portion of the Playstation Playstation website where you can find helpful suggestions for several PS3-related dilemmas.\n\nIf none of these incidences seem to mimic your specific Playstation woe, then you can return to the main support page where at the bottom right there is a heading titled, \"General Support Resources\".\n\nThis problem is well-addressed on the Playstation support site which gives you the opportunity to enter your eight digit error code into a search engine.\n\nThere is never a shortage of news about the PlayStation 3 and today is no different.\n\nThat said, it is still one of the more popular PS2 emulators out there -- especially for lower-resolution, lower-speed games -- and serves as a benchmark for other PlayStation 2 emulators.\n\nYou won't see it mentioned on the Capcom website right now, but the sleek and pale demonkiller Dante makes a repeat performance on the new PlayStation.\n\nThe next-generation gaming consoles wars are really starting to heat up, and the question on everyone's mind is, \"When will the PlayStation 3 finally become available?\"\n\nSony kept a good thing going with the current PlayStation 2, achieving great success despite some pretty stiff competition from Microsoft in the form of the Xbox, and from Nintendo in the form of the GameCube.\n\nIf Sony does in fact not release the Sony PlayStation 3 until next year, it could find itself at a significant disadvantage, especially if the Xbox 360 and Revolution establish powerful presences in the marketplace.\n\nStill, Sony's GFLOPs figures are impressive, and if no one's lying to us - or if both parties are lying to us by about the same percentage, which is the more likely situation - the PlayStation 3 is your leader.\n\nThe question is, will there be rumors about Sadaam Hussein buying dozens of PlayStation 3s to network together for Scud missile guidance systems, as there were with the PlayStation 2?\n\nThe PlayStation 3 only has a slot for a 2.5\" hard drive; by all indications, Sony will leave this expensive hardware goodie out of their base system as well.\n\nWith the dominance of the PlayStation 2, they have a shot at it - but it'll be an uphill battle.\n\nIf they will only buy one new console, as is often the case, how likely are those 100 million PlayStation 2 owners to buy an Xbox 360 instead of a PlayStation 3?\n\nOther PSX cheat devices actually allow cheaters to bypass the PlayStation's copy protection schemes and browse the contents of the game CDs in the comfort of their living rooms.\n\nLooking at the controller on the Xbox 360 or the PlayStation 2, nearly all of the buttons are used in many wrestling games.\n\nWhether you are looking to buy some of the best PS3 games or you are more interested in the diamond in the rough, it is very possible to pay much less than the regular retail price on the games you want to play on your Sony PlayStation 3.\n\nThis year, Sony is seeking to top themselves with the new Playstation 3, which is speculated to be released in November 2006, boasting a new CPU, multi-platform capability and Blu-Ray laser technology.\n\nGamers will be drooling over the new Playstation 3 with its use of the new \"Cell\" processor, which can handle a workload of intense graphics, downloading video/music clips or just surfing the web.\n\nFollowing in the theme of supreme realism, it doesn't get much better than Gran Turismo 4 for the Sony PlayStation 2.\n\nRayman Raving Rabbids is also available for the Xbox 360, PC, and PlayStation 2, though it's the motion sensitive controls that make RRR such a hit for the Wii.\n\nThankfully, although it is not without its shortcomings, Resistance is absolutely a top-notch offering and easily the best launch title available for the PlayStation 3.\n\nBut, given that Sony is marketing the PlayStation 3 as a processing powerhouse, you would think that the graphics would have more of \"wow\" factor to them.\n\nEvery person who has a PlayStation 3, especially those of you are fans of the FPS genre, should most definitely pick up Resistance.\n\nIt's easily one of the best titles available on the Sony PlayStation 2, especially if you are a big fan of the Lord of the Rings trilogy.\n\nThe reviews on Buzz Quiz Show for PlayStation 2 have largely been quite positive, because the quiz show series is easy to play and it can easily be fun for the whole family!\n\nThe idea of ripping discs quickly gained in popularity with the first two PlayStation video game consoles, so the Sony PlayStation 3 really is no exception to this trend.\n\nHowever, a big part of the price of the PS3 went into the Blu-ray player, so you could make use of that existing technology instead.It should be noted that the PlayStation 3 only contains a Blu-ray player and not a Blu-ray burner.\n\nThe idea is to install a special build of Linux on the PlayStation 3 and then going through a specialized process to successfully dump PS3 Blu-ray movie discs.\n\nThere are resources online where you can find free downloadable PlayStation ROMS, but many of these sites can run into a legal gray area.\n\nIf you're not the proud owner of an Xbox 360 or a PlayStation 3, is it still worth your while to invest in Rock Band PS2?\n\nThere are at least five critical differences that may make you reconsider your decision to buy this rhythm game for the PlayStation 2.\n\nAs such, the Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3 versions of Rock Band offer online play, meaning that you can actually rock out with people all around the world.\n\nThe other set of tracks are available for purchase through Xbox Live Arcade on the Xbox 360 or the PlayStation Network on the PlayStation 3.\n\nIf you've already played through all the Rock Band unlock songs in both the first game and the sequel, then perhaps it is time to spend a little more money by purchasing additional tracks through Xbox Live Arcade or the PlayStation Network.\n\nWell, they've taken a completely different route with the Rumble Roses franchise that debuted last year on the Sony PlayStation 2.\n\nIn this way, it initially competed against the SNES and was winning, until the Sony PlayStation and Nintendo 64 (N64) hit shelves, and literally took the wind out from under the Saturn's wings.\n\nThe Saturn had a heck of a lot of processing power for its time, and is said to be potentially more powerful than both the PlayStation and the N64.\n\nCombining the above-named two factors, Sony quickly began to lose third party support, especially to the Sony PlayStation, just as the Nintendo 64 did due to the limitations and high costs of cartridge games.\n\nNintendo was still pushing Mario on its Nintendo 64, and the PlayStation had quite a few amiable personalities, but the Saturn kind of came up short.\n\nFrom creepy third-party horror games like D to in-house developed racers like Daytona USA, the Sega Saturn had a reasonable selection of games, but nowhere close to the huge library found on the Sony PlayStation.\n\nThe Sony PlayStation was born at the end of 1994 and very quickly became the number one selling console, beating Nintendo's efforts at the time.\n\nSales were strong and SCEI continued to dominate the gaming market, largely due to the support of popular franchises made exclusive to the PlayStation such as the Final Fantasy series.\n\nWith the enormous success of its PlayStation consoles it was only a matter of time before SCEI would enter the portable market.\n\nThe Sony PlayStation hit the home gaming world in 1994 (in Japan; it came to the USA and Europe in 1995) and became an instant wonder.\n\nPlayers flocked to their closest electronics stores and made the PlayStation the best selling home console of all time -- to date, over 100 million units have been sold, including the slimmer PSone.\n\nThe biggest selling points of the PlayStation were its ability to have long cinematic sequences, deep soundtracks, and most of all, innovative games that revolutionized the
