        "text": "11 8,402\n\nDeveloper @aldostools has released an unofficial update for the CFW Flash Writer to support HFW 4.91 on the PS3. This can be a secondary candidate for allowing Custom Firmware installations when bguerville's PS3Toolset (https://www.ps3toolset.com/bgtoolset/) isn't accessible or a self hosting offline option. However, The Ps3toolset is still the preferred and safest method when available for hacking your capable ps3 model so its ready for PS3 Custom Firmware installations.​\n\n33 42,354\n\nScene Developer & Hacker TheFlow who has been a legend in various PlayStation Scene's, has done it yet again!! This time the developer has released \"The first PlayStation 4 Kernel RCE, Supporting FWs upto 11.00\".\n\nWith the newly released (PoC) jailbreak the community will be able to update popular Homebrew Enabler's (Mira & GoldHEN) to support firmware 11.00 with this new jailbreak that TheFlow has disclosed (CVE-2006-4304) through the bounty program and has been patched in the latest PS4 firmware available​\n\n86 89,233\n\nFollowing Sony firmware update of 4.91 for the PS3, developer's across the scene have been updating various exploits and tools. We have seen developer @Evilnat release his 4.91 PS3 Custom Firmware's earlier in the week. Then we recently just had @esc0rtd3w & @Joonie provide PS3HEN (& HFW) updated with 4.91 Support. Now we have developer @bguerville with an update to his PS3 Toolset to support the exploiting of 4.91 OFW for custom firmware installation for capable models.​\n\nThe PS3 Toolset's - System Manager (SM) will allow for exploiting of the PlayStation 3 internal flash, to then allow for a CFW installation such as Evilnat's Custom Firmware. You must have a CFW capable model, the PS3 Toolset will determine if your console is CFW compatible.(All Fat Models and early Slim Models).\n\n​\n\n-STLcardsWS ​\n\n86 326,022\n\nThe Official PS3HEN exploit has been updated to v3.3.0 with some new changes from @esc0rtd3w and @Joonie of Team PS3Xploit to support 4.91. Also, developer Joonie has brought back the webkit exploit from 4.82 to 4.91 with the official HFW release (HFW = OFW with old webkit injected). Its best to use the official HFW when using the official PS3HEN release.​\n\nPS3HEN is an exploit useful for PS3 Console's that do not have the ability to install a CFW ( those later Slim & SuperSlim Models). While it can be installed on all PS3 Models, PS3HEN is not as powerful as Custom Firmware is on your console, but PS3HEN is not far behind and has plenty of features to get the most out of your console. We have created a guide detailing and comparing the differences between the two exploits CFW and PS3HEN, that can be seen > here <​\n\n20 145,264\n\nUPDATE - See 1st post for details, Re-Release a few bugs corrected\n\nPlayStation 3 CFW developer @Evilnat has just released his much anticipated 4.91 Evilnat Custom Firmware following the recent routine update from Sony when they dropped firmware 4.91 last week. If you are on any Custom Firmware currently all you have to do is install this CFW PuP by the USB method. You will not need to wait for an update to bguerville's PS3 Toolset to exploit your system (as its already exploited if you are running CFW).\n\nIf you had updated to 4.91 OFW or by mistake installed a HFW you will have to wait for the PS3 Toolset to be updated. Developer bguerville was waiting for the first 4.91 CFW to drop before making his update and that has just occurred with this release, so it should not be to long before we see bguerville provide a 4.91 update to the toolset as the developer described here in the psx-place forums..​\n\n77 130,436\n\nUPDATE: its now safe to update to 4.91. PS3HEN (& HFW), CFW & PS3 Toolset have been updated to support 4.91.\n\nPS3 Firmware 4.91 is now Live\n\nThe expected once a year firmware update has been executed by Sony, PS3 4.91 Firmware is now Live. While an expected update, could this bring other changes to the firmware? Likely not but its still early to conclude as this update is fresh as of writing .\n\nDo not update, various exploits / tools / essential homebrew will need to be updated to support the latest firmware update of 4.91. See below for a short FAQ on 4.91, as there is always some confusions around the update process. .​\n\n46 24,596\n\nDeveloper @deank who has been continuing development of the (modded version) of the original media center that started on the PS3 (now runs on Android, Amazon Fire Stick, MacOS ,Windown ,Linux & Raspberry pi). The media center originally was named \"Showtime\" on the PS3 but later renamed to \"Movian\" by the original developer Andreas Oman years ago.\n\nSince that time, we have not seen the official project do much in recent years (currently home site is down as of writing), but developer deank has been keeping the project alive and evolving (see changelogs over at brewology for all archived changes). One of the biggest changes you will see within Movian-M7 compared to older version, is the change from the older (abandoned) \"libav\" video decoders/parsers to the current \"ffmpeg\" that was just replaced in the recent M7 update . This should improve compatibility and make for a more up-to date and versatile media player for all supported platforms including the PS3.\n\nAlso, deank has made a quick stop in the forum's, then to see a reported issue and provided a fix (seen here) that is now present in v7.0.2​\n\n4 19,412\n\nFollowing the release of etaHEN (AIO Homebrew Enabler for the PS5) last month from @lightingModz. Now, the release of ItemzFlow has arrived for the PlayStation 5 from developer @ligthingmodz. Originally this Homebrew & Game Manager was released on the PS4, but the developer has made a special Christmas Release now bringing the homebrew app for the PS5 that is handy for managing and preserving your personal backups.\n\n(JUN 27, 2024) Update: v1.06 has been released with new improvements and features.​\n\n10 14,390\n\nThis is a very interesting discovery or rather disclosure from one of the developer's of the PlayStation 1 (PS1) game Alien Resurrection (Martin Piper) who had reached out to YouTuber MVG who has been given permission to disclose something that has always been there all this time in the game, but needed a cheat code to unlock the ability to run backups on a stock retail PS1, acting as a boot disc for the swap method. MVG details the process here in this video:​"
