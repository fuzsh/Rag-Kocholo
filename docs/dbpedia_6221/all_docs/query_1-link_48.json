        "text": "Have you been looking forward to diving into the world of magic spells, potions, and witchcraft? Then, the moment has come. On February 10th, Warner Bros Games released the most-anticipated game of the year developed by Avalanche Software – Hogwarts Legacy. Although you won’t meet any familiar characters from the Harry Potter franchise, as the game’s events take place during the 1890s, you will definitely enjoy getting back to the most famous school of witchcraft and wizardry and immersing yourself in another magical adventure.\n\nBut before you start playing, there is one important question to answer. Which platform will provide you with the most outstanding gaming experience? Hogwarts Legacy is currently available on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X, and Xbox Series S. Later this year, it will also be released for PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and Nintendo Switch. Keep reading to learn more about platforms for Hogwarts Legacy and decide which one to choose.\n\nThe record-breaking release of Hogwarts Legacy\n\nBefore the recent release of Hogwarts Legacy, many doubted the game’s success. Although it was one of the most anticipated games of the year, some Harry Potter fans even called for a boycott. The controversy around it was mostly due to the author of the Harry Potter franchise. Previously, JK Rowling was criticized for her ambiguous comments regarding the transgender community. But on February 10th, the day of Hogwarts Legacy’s release, it became clear that nothing could prevent the game from becoming a major hit.\n\nNeed proof? Here you are. Hogwarts Legacy has already become the biggest Harry Potter game launch of all time.\n\nMoreover, the game experienced the second-highest peak (489,139 players) in history for a paid, singleplayer game on Stream after surpassing Fallout 4 (472,962 players). It also became the fifth most-played game on the platform. Finally, Hogwarts Legacy is currently the most-watched game on Twitch (the peak viewership was over 1,3 million viewers).\n\nIs it really that good? Well, that is up to you to make the verdict. But the critics definitely love it – Hogwarts Legacy has received a 9/10 rating on IGN, 83% on PC Gamer, and an 84 score on Metacritic.\n\nSo whether you’re a loyal Harry Potter fan or just want to see if the game’s really worth it, you probably wonder which platform will ensure the best graphics, interactions, loading times, and overall gaming experience.\n\nWhat is Hogwarts Legacy’s best platform?\n\nAccording to the most recent data, 82% of Hogwarts Legacy sales were on PlayStation 5 when it comes to gaming consoles. The remaining 18% preferred Xbox X|S. However, this significant difference will likely shrink due to the upcoming digital sales for digital-only Xbox Series S.\n\nNow, it’s time to reveal what each platform has to offer to Hogwarts Legacy players.\n\n1. PC\n\nPlaying Hogwarts Legacy on your PC certainly has several advantages to consider. It costs less than PS5 and Xbox versions while released on the same date. Moreover, if your device meets system requirements, this option will provide quite an outstanding gaming experience. Let’s take a closer look at the benefits and potential downsides of Hogwarts Legacy for PC.\n\nStandard Edition price: $59.99\n\nDeluxe Edition price: $69.99\n\nArguments for playing Hogwarts Legacy on PC:\n\nCustomization. The game can be tailored to PC users’ preferences thanks to various mods. This feature will allow you to experiment with the gameplay, enjoy some extra tricks, and even improve the game’s performance. Some of the most interesting mods in Hogwarts Legacy are the Arachnophobia mode (if you can’t stand spiders, it will turn them into harmless cubes), Mouse controls for your broom, and the Ascendio mod that will help you resolve the potential frame rate issues. And the weirdest one – you can even transform your broom into… Shrek!\n\nNavigation and interactions. You can easily navigate the menus and interact with the game’s environment using your mouse and keyboard.\n\nFrame rate and graphics. Ultra 4K experience with high-quality graphics and frame rate are also available for PC users. However, it’s only possible if your hardware meets the most advanced system requirements. Otherwise, you will likely face significant performance issues, especially when streaming or recording your gameplay (more on that in a bit).\n\nThe ability to play anywhere. If you have a gaming laptop, you can play Hogwarts Legacy even while away from home or connect it to your TV.\n\nDrawbacks:\n\nFrame drops and bugs. Unlike PS5 and Xbox X|S owners, those playing Hogwarts Legacy on PC report some issues like frame drops and graphic bugs. However, you can fix most of those problems by disabling Ray Tracing, changing DLSS settings, and turning down your graphical settings from Ultra to High. Besides, you can use the Ascendio mod mentioned above.\n\nStrict system requirements. You need to have a high-end PC to play the game on Ultra with stable 60fps.\n\nTo be more precise, here are the system requirements to play Hogwarts Legacy on your PC:\n\nFor low-quality settings (at 720p with 30fps): Intel i5-6600 (3.3GHz), 16GB of RAM, 85GB of storage, and an Nvidia GeForce GTX 960 with 4GB of memory.\n\nFor high-quality settings (at 2160p with 60 fps): Intel i7-10700 (3.80GHz) with 32GB of RAM, Nvidia RTX 3090 Ti, and 85GB of SSD storage.\n\n2. PlayStation 5\n\nPS5 is probably the most popular platform to play Hogwarts Legacy. It’s likely because PlayStation users will access several extra perks that will become available on other platforms no earlier than in a year. So let’s explore the benefits of getting Hogwarts Legacy on PS5.\n\nStandard Edition price: $69.99\n\nDeluxe Edition price: $79.99\n\nArguments for playing Hogwarts Legacy on PS5:\n\nFast loading times. You won’t likely deal with any loading speed challenges when playing Hogwarts Legacy on PS5.\n\nExclusive content. Perhaps, the biggest advantage of PS5 over other Hogwarts Legacy consoles is some unique content unavailable elsewhere. In particular, that’s the Haunted Hogsmeade Shop Quest, which will appear on other platforms only in a year. Besides, the Deluxe Edition for PS5 includes another bonus – Felix Felicis potion recipe (however, it’s available only if you pre-ordered the PS5 version of the game).\n\nHigh-quality graphics and 4K resolution support. So far, there are no major complaints about the graphics, frame rate, and overall performance of Hogwarts Legacy on PS5. The game is available in many different modes, including Fidelity mode (30fps) and Performance mode (60fps).\n\nA more immersive gaming experience. Another benefit that makes the PS5 version stand out is the availability of DualSense controllers. With the help of adaptive triggers, haptic feedback, LED light feedback, touchpad usage, and other advanced features, you can get better control over your magic wand and cast spells that trigger various special effects and enemies’ reactions.\n\nDrawbacks:\n\nWhile Fidelity with Ray Tracing mode seems to work better on PS5, many users compared Hogwarts Legacy PS5 vs. Xbox Series X, and their experience was more satisfying on Xbox.\n\n3. Xbox Series X|S\n\nXbox Series X and Series S are other popular options to consider. Just like with PS5, Xbox offers quite an extraordinary gaming experience. Let’s look at its specifics in more detail.\n\nStandard Edition price: $69.99\n\nDeluxe Edition price: $79.99\n\nDigital Deluxe Edition price: $79.99\n\nArguments for playing Hogwarts Legacy on Xbox Series X|S:\n\nHigh-quality graphics in different modes. Apart from 4K resolution, which is also available on Xbox Series X and S, this console allows for even more spectacular graphics than PS5 in different modes, including Fidelity, Performance, Balanced modes, and more.\n\nXbox cloud save option. Thanks to Xbox cloud save, you can preserve your game progress on your PC and continue playing whenever you want.\n\nFast loading times. Just like with PS5, you won’t face any loading issues with Xbox Series X and S.\n\nDigital version available. Xbox is a popular option for those who prefer to purchase the game digitally. The Hogwarts Legacy Digital Deluxe Edition was released on the same date as the physical version.\n\nDrawbacks:\n\nNo extra content. Unlike PS5, Xbox Series X and Series S do not provide access to any exclusive quests and locations.\n\nNo Ray Tracing with Series S. Xbox Series S doesn’t support the Ray Tracing option. However, Series X does. Besides, this effect is quite noisy even on high-quality PCs, so it’s not a big loss.\n\nNo haptic effects support. DualSense controller is available only to PlayStation users, so you won’t be able to enjoy a fully immersive experience with Xbox.\n\n4. PlayStation 4 and Xbox One\n\nHogwarts Legacy for previous-gen consoles is cheaper than for PS5, Xbox Series X|S, and PC’s Deluxe Edition. However, they will be released on April 4th, 2023. Therefore, we can only guess what the performance of the PS4 and Xbox One versions of the game will be like. Nevertheless, here are a few things we can tell in advance.\n\nStandard Edition price: $59.99\n\nDeluxe Edition price: $69.99\n\nArguments for playing Hogwarts Legacy on PS4 and Xbox One:\n\nPS4 is more common compared to PS5. The most recent console sales data shows that PS4 still overperforms PS5. In fact, the previous-gen console has outsold the newer version by 3.19 million units. So when choosing between Hogwarts Legacy PS4 vs. PS5, the older version may appear completely satisfying. The same applies to Xbox Series One. But if you’re looking for the highest-quality graphics and excellent gaming experience, note the disadvantages of PS4 and Xbox One.\n\nDrawbacks:\n\nNo 4K support. When talking about previous-gen consoles, only PS4 Pro might allow for 4K resolution, so the game won’t look and feel as stunning as on newer consoles and powerful PCs.\n\nWorse performance and a 30fps lock. The overall performance and frame rate are expected to be much worse on PS4 and Xbox One. In particular, there might be more frame drops, texture glitches, and potential bugs. Moreover, you won’t be able to go beyond the 30fps modes.\n\n5. Nintendo Switch\n\nOur final contestant, Nintendo Switch, has the latest release date of Hogwarts Legacy – it will be available only on July 25th, 2023. So far, it’s quite difficult to predict the game’s performance on this platform. So let’s look at a few things we can be more or less sure about.\n\nStandard Edition price: $59.99\n\nDeluxe Edition price: $69.99\n\nArguments for playing Hogwarts Legacy on Nintendo Switch:\n\nYou can play the game anywhere you want. You can remove your Nintendo Switch from the dock and take it with you wherever you like. Just like with a gaming laptop, this will allow you to play Hogwarts Legacy even when away from home, but even in a more convenient form factor.\n\nJoy-Cons controller. The Nintendo Switch’s controllers have left and right variations with motion controls, which will likely provide you with some exclusive gaming experience when casting spells by moving your wrists.\n\nDrawbacks:\n\nLate release date. When comparing Hogwarts Legacy Switch vs. PS5, Xbox Series X|S, and PC, the Nintendo Switch owners will have to wait for the desired release longer than other users.\n\nPotentially poorer performance. Since Nintendo Switch was designed to be a compact console in the first place, some major performance issues are very likely to occur due to the hardware. Some users on Reddit even assume there will be a cloud-based version of Hogwarts Legacy on this platform. But the official website of the game hasn’t confirmed this theory. So to be compatible with other consoles, Nintendo Switch will need to significantly improve its capabilities and unique features, including the Joy-Cons controller.\n\nSo, which platform should you choose?\n\nNow, let’s summarize our comparison to determine which platform works best for playing Hogwarts Legacy. We will consider only PS5, Xbox Series X|S, and the PC version since the game hasn’t been released for previous-gen consoles and Nintendo Switch by the time this article is written. Also, note that we consider a PC with powerful hardware that meets the most advanced system requirements.\n\nAs you see, the PS5 platform outperforms PC and Xbox in several aspects. In particular, it provides exclusive content and supports haptic effects thanks to DualSense controllers. On the other hand, Xbox is a great option as well since it offers excellent graphics and frame rates in various modes. Finally, a PC can be your number one choice if your device has sufficient capabilities.\n\nBut no matter which of Hogwarts Legacy platforms – PC, PS4, PS5, Xbox, or Nintendo – you choose, it’s worth prioritizing your privacy and security when playing your beloved games. And that is where a reliable virtual private network (VPN) service like VeePN comes in handy.\n\nWhy use a VPN when playing your favorite games\n\nApart from masking your IP address and rerouting your traffic through a remote server, a VPN encrypts your data and protects your device from various cyber threats. This way, you can preserve your privacy and secure yourself, whatever you’re up to and wherever you are. Moreover, a virtual private network is a multi-platform solution. You can use a VPN for Hogwarts Legacy with any platform, including PC, Xbox, and PlayStation.\n\nBesides, you can take advantage of a VPN when playing your favorite online games. Here are several main benefits a VPN for gaming provides.\n\nHave no-lag gaming experience. High ping is one of the most critical challenges you may face when playing online games. But thanks to a VPN, you get a lag-free connection, which means your data will travel to your favorite game’s server and back to your device in no time.\n\nAvoid Internet throttling. When your Internet service provider (ISP) throttles your traffic, they artificially slow down your connection speed and limit your bandwidth. For gamers, this may spoil the whole fun. Luckily, a VPN stops Internet throttling. It encrypts your data, so your ISP and other third parties cannot see what you’re up to when going online.\n\nProtect yourself from distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks. This type of cyber attack is the most common for gamers. According to Acamai research, 37% of all DDoS attacks target the gaming industry. And that is another reason to use a VPN when playing. It will add an extra security layer to your device and ensure a secure gaming experience, especially when you’re playing to stream the game.\n\nEnjoy Hogwarts Legacy with VeePN\n\nLooking for a powerful solution to securely play and stream Hogwarts Legacy and other favorite games?
