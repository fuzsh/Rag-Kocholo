So if you coveted one then but missed out now is your chance to pick one up for free!\n\nThe Lego Harry Potter Years 5-7 video game tells the story of Harry‚Äôs final years at Hogwarts School Of Witchcraft and Wizardry.\n\nIt is a sequel to the first, highly successful (ie addictive!) Lego Harry Potter game released in 2010, and contains scenes and characters from the last three books (or last four films); Order Of the Phoenix, Half Blood Prince and Deathly Hallows.\n\nThe game will be available for Wii, Nintendo DS, XBox, Playstation 3, Playstation Portable and PC.\n\nStill Confunded?\n\nRead more about the Lego Harry Potter Years 5-7 Video Game."
