        "text": "PlayStation Portable PSP-1000 Developer Sony Type Handheld game console Generation Seventh generation Release date 2004 Discontinued 2014 Predecessor PocketStation Successor PlayStation Vita Emulated ✓\n\nFor emulators that run on the PlayStation Portable, see Emulators on PSP.\n\nThe PlayStation Portable (PSP) is a handheld game console made by Sony. The system was released in Japan on December 12, 2004, in North America on March 24, 2005, and in the PAL region on September 1, 2005. It was retailed for $249. It had a MIPS R4000 CPU at 333 MHz with 32 MBs of RAM. Later revisions of the PSP came with 64 MBs of RAM, allowing for faster load times.\n\nThe PSP had one of the most active modding scenes of any handheld console starting from the very early days of its life, utilized for homebrew, emulation, and piracy. Additionally, the PSP's software architecture that required the use of Sony's static libraries for many console functions made the simple and fast HLE approach both reasonable and accurate. Emulation efforts began as early as 2006, with games booting two years later, although overall game compatibility was poor. This early work was used as a basis for PPSSPP at the start of the 2010s, which has developed PSP emulation into a polished, fast, and accurate experience.\n\nEmulators[edit]\n\nComparisons[edit]\n\nPPSSPP\n\nAn HLE approach PSP emulator and released in November 2012. Compatibility is higher than JPCSP and games runs significantly faster. Despite limitations in its PSP hardware feature support, PPSSPP shines as an emulator with impressive enhancement capabilities. The emulator is currently capable of playing the vast majority of the PSP library, while remaining 3687 titles are still unreported.\n\nJPCSP\n\nAn LLE approach PSP emulator, and it requires the Java Runtime Environment to be installed. It is also slower compared to PPSSPP, and it was built around debugging and was never really meant to be a standard emulator. They made it so they could understand the PSP's inner workings better. Thanks to the JPCSP team, and other PSP homebrew teams, PPSSPP developed at breakneck speeds. Both teams communicate a lot and contribute with each other.\n\nOfficial Sony emulators\n\nEmulating some of the PSP library of games is possible with a Jailbroken PS3. Using the unlocked firmware's internal PSP emulator, there are 2 available modes: Remaster & Mini's we can utilize each giving different result depending on the title. See this guide for more information.\n\nHardware features[edit]\n\nConnectivity[edit]\n\nPSP supports local multiplayer on the same network via Ad-Hoc and local multiplayer over the internet with XLink Kai (see setup guide). PSP also supports online multiplayer using private servers via Infrastructure mode.\n\nPPSSPP supports local multiplayer on the same network[1] and local multiplayer over the internet[2][3] via Ad-Hoc PRO Online. However there is no support for XLink Kai at the moment. Infrastructure mode emulation support is in work-in-progress, see this issue page for more information.\n\nJPCSP supports local multiplayer on the same network and local multiplayer over the internet via XLink Kai.\n\nSee these sources for Ad-Hoc PRO Online compatibility list and revived private servers for Infastructure mode;\n\nAd-Hoc local wireless connection compatibility list, Ad-Hoc local wireless multiplayer over internet servers for PPSSPP. See LAN Tunneling programs for more information about LAN Tunneling.\n\nInfrastructure-compatible PSP games with revived private server for online multiplayer, see Preservation projects page for more information about private server revive projects.\n\nPlayStation 3 communication[edit]\n\nAdhoc Party support, remote play (via the PS3 system's wireless LAN), copying games to play on a PSP system that can be played on either PS3 or PSP systems etc.\n\nUsing remote play (via the PS3 system's wireless LAN)\n\nCopying games to play on a PSP system that can be played on either PS3 or PSP systems\n\nUMD Music, UMD Video and UMD-PG[edit]\n\nDuring the era of the PlayStation Portable (PSP), \"UMD Movie\" was more common as it represented the main function of the format but as UMD adoption expanded beyond movies and included other types of video content such as TV shows, music videos, and documentaries, \"UMD Video\" became a more generic term to encompass the full range of applications. While UMD primarily focused on movies and video content, there was also some limited use of the format for UMD Music. However, it wasn't nearly as widespread as movie or other UMD Video content. UMD-PG on the other hand stands for UMD-Players Game, and it was used for a unique type of interactive media released on UMDs for the PlayStation Portable (PSP).\n\nPPSSPP has no UMD Video or UMD-PG support at the moment: UMD Movie request and UMD Video and UMD-PG request for PPSSPP. See PPSSPP FAQ: Can PPSSPP play UMD video discs? section.\n\nJPCSP has partial UMD Video support (demonstration). Also see UmdVideoPlayer.java for how it's implemented.\n\nAdrenaline never had UMD Video support.\n\nSee this dedicated page for more information about interactive media and home media playback support for emulation softwares.\n\nSee Ripping games.\n\nXMB and apps[edit]\n\nPSDevWiki: XrossMediaBar\n\nThe XrossMediaBar (pronounced \"cross-media bar\" and officially abbreviated as XMB) is a graphical user interface developed by Sony Computer Entertainment. You can launch various applications from this interface as well.\n\nPPSSPP do not support XMB, but for better immersion with XMB-like interface there are additional UI features for PPSSPP such as;\n\nYou can use custom sound files for PPSSPP UI and game list navigation feedback sounds[1]. Also you can use custom sound files for RetroAchievement notifications[2], for setting these up you need to set \"Settings> UI Sounds: On\", \"UI Background animation: Waves\" and \"Theme: Default\", after these you need to change .wav files from \"\\PPSSPP\\assets\" directory with your custom .wav files. Also there is a feature request for intro sound implementation to PPSSPP UI similar to XMB (concept demonstration).\n\nPPSSPP supports music playback when a game selected in the menu screen[3] similar to XMB, but currently there is no video support on this screen for PPSSPP UI as \"hrydgard\" mentioned in that pull request.\n\nPPSSPP supports background wallpaper change when when a game selected in the menu screen[4] similar to XMB.\n\nPPSSPP's UI font could be changed if you want. For this you need to change .TTF font file from \"\\PPSSPP\\assets\" directory with your custom .TTF font file but it needs to be renamed as “Roboto-Condensed.ttf” just like original PPSSPP one (easiest solution).[5][6]\n\nJPCSP is able to boot the official PSP VSH interface, though the menus are not yet working properly, it is currently only an alpha release.\n\nBooting VSH in JPCSP Guide.\n\nEnhancements[edit]\n\nEmulation issues[edit]\n\nFor more information about PSP hardware and reverse engineering;\n\nMVG: PSP in 2023, How the Sony Playstation Portable PSP Security was defeated, A closer look at the Sony PSP DTP-T1000 Development Kit, Another look at the Sony PSP GO Handheld in 2018\n\nRodrigo Copetti's PSP Architecture Practical Analysis\n\nPPSSPP: Blog, Discord\n\nPSDevWiki - PSP\n\nReferences[edit]"
