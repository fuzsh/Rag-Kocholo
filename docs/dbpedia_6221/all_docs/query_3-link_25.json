        "text": "Following days of speculation, Insider Gaming can report that there’s a new PlayStation Handheld in development.\n\nUPDATE – Sony has now confirmed its next PlayStation handheld is called the PlayStation Portable. You can read more about the device here.\n\nCodenamed the Q Lite, the next PlayStation handheld is the next piece of Sony hardware that aims to be yet another piece of hardware that requires the PlayStation 5. Insider Gaming understands that the Q Lite is not a cloud-streaming device, but instead uses Remote Play with the PlayStation 5 – A feature the console giant has been pushing these past couple of weeks.\n\nSporting adaptive streaming up to 1080p and 60FPS, the new device will require constant connectivity to the internet.\n\nAs for the console’s physical features, early prototypes show the console will look a lot like a PlayStation 5 controller, but with a massive 8-inch LCD touchscreen in the center. The device sports adaptive triggers for haptic feedback and will include what you would come to expect from a handheld – Volume buttons, speakers, an audio input jack, etc.\n\nInsider Gaming understands that the Q Lite is in its QA phase and is scheduled to release before the PlayStation 5 Pro and after the Detachable Disc Drive PS5.\n\nAs previously mentioned by industry insider Jeff Grubb, Sony is planning to announce its “second phase of the PS5”, which was in reference to its future game slate. Ironically though, this “second phase” is very much true for Sony’s hardware offerings, with the new detachable disc drive PlayStation 5, Project Nomad (wireless earphones), Project Voyager (wireless headset), and Q Lite (handheld) all scheduled to release within a very short period. It’s understood that the PlayStation 5 Pro is aiming for a holiday 2024 release.\n\nSo whenever Sony’s next PlayStation Showcase will be, it’s seemingly going to be a big one.\n\nWhat do you think of Sony’s new handheld console? Let us know in the comments below."
