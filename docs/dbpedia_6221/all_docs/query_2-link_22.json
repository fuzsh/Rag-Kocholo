        "text": "Smash Br0 said:\n\nI agree, they left out too many good parts (especially the big fight scene at the end).\n\nNot a bad movie all in all, though... The book was just much better.\n\nThey have done that for every movie thus far, instead of making it 3 hours and filling in all the bloody important storyline plot holes and character development, they just toss in all the action and call it a movie. Hell, the last two books are mostly just drama until the very end, there isn't much fighting and much fewer action moments. I haven't seen the new movie but considering how much was missing from Order of the Phoenix, at least they finally decided to tell some story which is supposed to be dramatic in contrast to the books by the sounds of it. There are those who never read the books so they would never understand all the emotional aspects the characters develop.\n\nHarumy said:\n\nSatangel said:\n\nI've watched all the HP movies in the cinema, but I'm really hesitant about watching this one in the cinema.\n\nApparently it isn't that good at all....\n\nSame here...\n\nThe last movie was bad compared to the book too... The books are huge, but they can do better i think... Maybe a 3 hours film like king kong\n\nYou have to take it for what it is, the book is a huge transition point between Order of the Phoenix and The Deathly Hallows, just the filmmakers are too bloody lazy to make a 3 hour movie because they don't want to spend the money and figure that kids won't want to sit through 3 hours of it, and the Half Blood Prince book is somewhat of a snooze fest so it is boring and some people will probably get bored watching this one. Can't be any worse then the second Matrix movie though which was just filler and almost no action.\n\nI haven't seen the latest HP movie as it's coming this thursday over here, but I don't have high expetations either, so I think I'll be OK with it..\n\nI was pretty much disapointed with every HP movie so far, so I learnt not to expect anything..\n\nMovies are in fact very bad, missing many parts (many IMPORTANT parts) from books, and I mostly don't even like the acters they've chosen..\n\nI do like the books very much (except maybe the last one, it was bit of a letdown), but all in all, I'll go and watch this one as well, and see if they can go even worst then they did so far (judging by comments, they can )\n\nThe movies fail because they don't want to try and lengthen the movies even though they really should, I loved the extended editions of Lord of the Rings because they filled in some missing parts of the story that could not be conveyed in the official release, however as to why they never even bothered with extended editions of Harry Potter is beyond me as I think it has so much potential from a sales perspective.\n\nI haven't seen the movie yet, but I was surprised that this only got a PG rating, while the previous two movie were PG-13 (unjustified, in my opinion). I suppose that it's because Voldemort never makes an appearance in this, but how could Voldemort alone make a movie PG-13, is he just that badass? If I remember correctly, there are Inferi (zombies) in the book, and if that whole scene were in the movie, it would have to be rated PG-13.\n\nAnd Deathly Hallows is going to kick ass since it's two movies, but the only bad thing is that we'll have to wait for it twice.\n\n@DeMoN...\n\nVoldemort is in the movie... just young Voldemort...\n\nThink of it this way...\n\nAnakin Skywalker = Darth Vader\n\nTom Riddle = Voldemort\n\nThey have 10 year old Tom and I'd say 16-18 year old Tom... so yea, Voldemort is in it.\n\nAs for the movie, I haven't read any of the books, but just enjoy the story of the movies. I know I'm missing a ton, but what I really think they were trying to do was (if I can continue with my Star Wars anaolgies), trying for a Empire ending... it seems as if the bad guys are winning... but then they'll pull it out with Jedi in the last movie, where all the good guys win.\n\nI liked the movie myself. They could have added 10 more minutes to the screen time to cram a couple more memories in and make it more complete. Particularly these-\n\nThe scene with Marvolo Gaunt, Morfin, and Merope. And the scene with the fat old witch. Mostly to help explain the horcruxes and what they were better. These didn't need to last long actually. Just get them in there. They also took out the parts with Bill and Fleur, despite their confirmation for Deathly Hallows movie (a set is being built of their house). We still haven't seen Bill in the movies, he's not been attacked by the werewolf, and everything else with their romance. The scene where the Burrow is incinerated was not in the book at all, and I wonder what was going through their heads there...\n\nI liked the acting better than before. The love scenes were pretty uncomfortable to watch, but that was the point. I guess it's for the best they're splitting up the last book into two movies. For financial reasons no doubt, but at least that means more coverage.\n\nI liked the movie. The books are always better, but I can separate myself from the book and the movie. On its own, it's a good one. Judged based on the source material, not as good.\n\nEDIT- the scene near the end in the cavern was really well acted with Dumbledore. It was sad, and I think he really made it disturbing to watch.\n\nI didn't hate it or like it. It was so-so.\n\nWhere I watched the movie was a special screening. It was a fund raiser by my school's PTA. There were a lot of students. They were like \"WOOOOOOOOOOOOOOAHHHH\" at the scene with Harry and that girl who I forgot her name in a robe. They were like that at the other scenes. They reacted in unison. They are the ones that kept me watching. lol\n\nThere was also this damn annoying kid next to me. He kept changing seats (There were three empty seats next to me), he kept turning his DAMN BRIGHT cellphone on and laughed so loud it doesn't sound real."
