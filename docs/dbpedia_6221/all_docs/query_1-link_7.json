        "text": "\"Point me!\"\n\nThis article is about the video game. You may be looking for the novel, film, the soundtrack, the video game soundtrack or the object of the same name.\n\nThe video game adaptation of Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire was released in November 2005 for seven platforms: PC, PlayStation 2 (PS2), Xbox, GameCube, PlayStation Portable (PSP), Nintendo DS, and Game Boy Advance (GBA).\n\nThe third title in EA's action-adventure Harry Potter franchise, it has a unique feel and gameplay, with elements not present in any other game of the franchise, including a camera of a 3D environment that is not player-controlled and a system in which previous levels can be played again at will. Due to higher-quality graphics in comparison to previous Harry Potter video games,[1] characters more closely resemble their movie counterparts. It was also the first Harry Potter game to feature a multiplayer mode.\n\nRelease[]\n\nThe game was first released in North America on 8 November 2005 for all platforms except the PSP. The European release took place two days later. The PSP version was released in North America on 15 November and in Europe on 18 November, the same day the film premiered.\n\nGameplay[]\n\nThe game does not feature an open-world interaction with Hogwarts. Instead, the player selects one among several nonconsecutive levels to play on a special menu that shows Dumbledore's pensieve. In most levels, the player must collect a number of Triwizard Shields, which will unlock new levels. In others, there are different tasks or challenges to be completed.\n\nJust like the previous game, the three playable characters are Harry Potter, Hermione Granger, and Ron Weasley; namely the main characters in the movie. In this game, however, the player(s) can choose which one(s) to control at the beginning of each level (with a few exceptions, such as the Triwizard tasks, in which only Harry appears). In single player, the two other characters will act as supporting NPCs. Similarly to Prisoner of Azkaban, also, the three characters can cast collaborative spells that are more powerful or produce better results, which can happen either in solo or in multiplayer. Characters can also capture moving items using Accio and increase their power with creature and character cards.\n\nMuch to many fans' anger and disappointment (as voiced on such community review sites as Gamespot.com), there is no RPG iteration, unlike with previous titles. Some also criticised that the PC version is not different from the others, unlike previous games. However, the Game Boy Advance version is different.\n\nUnlike all other 3D games in EA's Harry Potter series, the camera is not directly controlled by the player(s); instead, it merely follows their movements. The PC version is keyboard-exclusive, not using the mouse at all, which is also unique.\n\nCharacters[]\n\nPlayable[]\n\nHarry Potter (voice Daniel Larner): A fourteen-year-old wizard in training. Harry is unexpectedly selected as a fourth champion in the Triwizard Tournament and must battle his way through three difficult tasks for the Tournament. He is a combination of both Ron and Hermione's weaknesses and strengths, but frequently needs help from his friends when danger is very near.\n\nRon Weasley (voice Gregg Chillin): Harry's best friend. Ron has an obsession on Bertie Bott's Every Flavour Beans and frequently alerts the team when Beans appear on the screen, He is also an avid runner, but can only perform Double Throw Spells, even when upgraded (unplayable during Triwizard Tournament).\n\nHermione Granger (voice Harper Marshall): Harry's other best friend. Hermione is known for her logic and excellent spell-casting. She becomes quite frustrated during the game at Ron's frequent exclamations about finding Bertie Bott's Every Flavour Beans. She is also a great witch capable of throwing Triple Throw Spells when upgraded (unplayable during Triwizard Tournament).\n\nNon-playable[]\n\nArthur Weasley (voice Dominic Coleman): Ron's father. Mr Weasley accompanies the Weasley family, Harry, and Hermione to the Quidditch World Cup at the beginning of the game. He also helps them out in the fight between the Death Eaters and the Quidditch game's spectators. He regularly makes sure that Harry, Ron and Hermione are safe throughout the journey to find the Portkey.\n\nBarty Crouch Jnr (voice Sam Hazeldine) (disguised as Mad-Eye Moody (voice Stanley Townsend)): The new Defence Against the Dark Arts teacher at Hogwarts. He provides several challenges to increase Harry, Ron, and Hermione's spellcasting abilities.\n\nCedric Diggory (voice Blake Ritson): the first Hogwarts Triwizard champion to be chosen. Cedric tells Harry the secret of the golden egg prior to the second task. In the Third Task, he serves as a loyal friend as he stuns Krum before he could attack Harry. In return, Harry has to save him from the Blast-Ended Skrewts lurking around the hedges. Cedric is Harry's champion card.\n\nFleur Delacour (voice Claudia Renton): the Beauxbatons Triwizard champion. She provides no major part to the game. You only see her during a cut-scene in the game and on one of Ron's cards, as she is Ron's champion card. She's also seen in the bonus movie.\n\nViktor Krum (Voice Boris Mitkova): the Durmstrang Triwizard champion. Under the influence of the Imperius Curse, he tries to attack Harry and Cedric in the Maze. Viktor Krum is Hermione's champion card.\n\nThe Monsters: Throughout their journey, whether in the castle or outside, Harry and his friends must join forces to eradicate dangerous beasts such as Erklings and Dugbogs. Many advanced creatures, such as Skrewts or a hoard of Vampyr Mosps, require the whole team to unite their strength to destroy them.\n\nLord Voldemort (Voice Ralph Fiennes): The most evil Dark wizard of all time. Harry has to fight him in the last level.\n\nDeath Eaters (Voices Duncan Wisbey and Matthew Marsh): The followers and supporters of Lord Voldemort.\n\nLocations[]\n\nPS2, PSP, GCN, Xbox and PC versions[]\n\nQuidditch World Cup Campsite\n\nDefence Against the Dark Arts, Lesson 1\n\nDefence Against the Dark Arts, Lesson 2\n\nMoody's Challenges (5 st)\n\nHogwarts Exterior\n\nForbidden Forest\n\nTriwizard Task 1: The Dragon\n\nPrefects' bathroom (not included on the PSP version)\n\nHerbology\n\nTriwizard Task 2: The Lake\n\nTriwizard Task 3: The Triwizard Maze\n\nVoldemort (At the graveyard in Little Hangleton)\n\nGBA and NDS version[]\n\nQuidditch World Cup Campsite\n\nDefence Against the Dark Arts\n\nForbidden Forest\n\nTriwizard Tournament, First Task\n\nYule Ball\n\nPrefects' bathroom\n\nCare of Magical Creatures\n\nTriwizard Tournament, Second Task\n\nMoody's Challenges\n\nTriwizard Tournament, Third Task\n\nRiddle Graveyard (At the graveyard in Little Hangleton)\n\nSpells[]\n\nCharms are activated mainly as interactive spells when nearby a charm-able object (and thus cannot be performed by themselves out in the open), and can be combined together with multiple characters via casting the same charm on a single target or jinxing a target whilst charming it:\n\nAccio: Summoning Charm. Used to attract many wizarding goods (Bertie Bott's Every Flavour Beans, Pumpkin Pasties, Cauldron Cakes and mini-shields). The strength of Accio can be adjusted depending on the cards you buy and equip. Used only in the console and PC versions, and can be performed on its own. Big Triwizard shields cannot be summoned by Accio.\n\nWingardium Leviosa: Levitating Charm. Can pick up many obstacles at ease, but sometimes requires the whole team to levitate a particularly heavy object (a big rock or a big block). It can be used to throw cauldrons to blast stone walls. It can also be used on creatures, such as Stunned Erklings.\n\nCarpe Retractum: Seize and Pull Charm. Used to pull inanimate objects towards the user. It can also be used to pull drawbridges or other obstacles, and more effective pulling is done by wiggling side-to-side away from the object in question. It can be used to throw Bubotubers on mushrooms or close giant taps. Carpe Retractum can also grapple itself on the Erklings' \"flutes\", or Vampyr Mosps' backs.\n\nAqua Eructo: Similar to Aguamenti (used in the sixth book), this spell creates water to put out fires, which may be created by Salamanders, Skrewts and the Hungarian Horntail. It is also used to cool down Fire Circles that prevent Salamanders from continuously spawning. Moving side-to-side can effectively straighten the stream without it losing its size.\n\nHerbivicus: Plant Growing Charm. Used especially to make lily pads grow for Harry and his friends so that they can safely cross a pond or other bodies of water. It is also used to grow special flowers that the Vampyr Mosps adore, temporarily giving you a distraction for a quick getaway, or could be used on Vampyr Mosps themselves to enhances jinxes. Moving side-to-side can effectively straighten the stream and increases its focus. However, in the handheld versions, it is fired as a projectile spell instead.\n\nAlohomora: Unlocking spell. Blasts open crates and trunks. Used as a projectile spell unlike the rest of the charms. (GBA/Nintendo DS only)\n\nConfundo: Charm that causes confusion on the recipient. Used to momentarily stun and confuse wild beasts. Used as a projectile spell unlike the rest of the charms, and is one of the primary offensive spells used before other variations are allowed on most creatures. (GBA/Nintendo DS only)\n\nGlacius: Instantly freezes water and other liquids, as well as some creatures to make them fragile and easy to shatter. (GBA/Nintendo DS only)\n\nReparo: Mending Charm. Restores broken items back to their original state (GBA/Nintendo DS only).\n\nIncendio: Charm used to conjure fire. Used to burn down plants and for herding Skrewts. (GBA/Nintendo DS only)\n\nVerdimillious: A jet of green sparks is emitted from the end of the wand. (GBA/Nintendo DS only)\n\nVentus: Charm used to emit wind, causing nearby obstacles to be pushed over. (GBA/Nintendo DS only)\n\nExpelliarmus: Disarming Charm in duelling. Used in the final battle primarily by Harry. (GBA/Nintendo DS only)\n\nJinxes are used to defeat monsters (Dugbogs, Erklings, Skrewts, etc.) or to get special surprises from objects (flower vases, dragon statues and dark magic detectors). Fired off as projectile attacks with slight homing properties, and can the button for them on the console and PC versions can be charged up a bit to fire a volley of projectiles for increased effectiveness (which can be enhanced by the purchase-able cards you can equip). Normally, jinxes are projectiles that stun enemy targets after enough hits have been landed, but they change into other spells depending on various conditions and the type of target being cast at.\n\nOrchideous: Reduces stunned Dugbogs or stunned Vampire Mosps charmed by Herbivicus into a bundle of levitating flowers. (console/PC only)\n\nOrbis: Simple blue jinx very similar to the \"Flipendo Jinx\" used in the previous games, which causes the target to spin around in an energy orb and be burrowed into the ground at a high speed. Can be used on levitated Dugbogs and levitated stunned Erklings. (console/PC only)\n\nInflatus: Makes stunned Salamanders being doused by Aqua Eructo swell up and pop, or transfigure the target into a pack of inflated balloons (on Vampire Mosps being pulled by Carpe Retractum or on stunned Skrewts). (console/PC only)\n\nAvifors: Transforms levitated-stunned Dugbogs and levitated-stunned Skrewts into a flock of ravens. (console/PC only)\n\nLapifors: Instantly turns stunned Salamanders into innocent little rabbits. The said rabbits hop around a while before bursting into thin air, or can be jinxed to make them burst sooner. (console/PC only)\n\nDucklifors: Similar to Lapifors in terms of mechanics; turns Skrewts being doused by Aqua Eructo into little ducklings. (console/PC only)\n\nMelofors: Useful spell used to encase an Erkling's head being pulled by Carpe Retractum within an enormous pumpkin. (console/PC only)\n\nPullus: Similar mechanics to Lapifos and Ducklifors; used to mutate stunned Erklings into chickens. (console/PC only)\n\nVermiculus: Transforms stunned Vampire Mosps into a tiny little worm. Works akin to Lapifors, Ducklifors and Pullus. (console/PC only)\n\nEbublio: Mutates Salamanders being doused by Aqua Eructo into a wad of bubbles, and is the primary jinx used in the second Triwizard Task against the Grindylows. (console/PC only)\n\nMagicus Extremos: Increases the power of a spell when it is performed by three people at the same time. (console/PC only)\n\nCreatures and plants[]\n\nDugbog - Marsh-dwelling creatures that resemble pieces of dead wood while stationary, though closer examination will reveal finned paws and very sharp teeth, they will bite.\n\nSalamanders - Fire-dwelling salamanders are an of a fiery red colour, they will try to breathe fire at you. These tend to often respawn at nearby fire circles that can be doused by Aqua Eructo to prevent more from appearing, though some fire circles will stop spawning them on their own if enough are defeated. Most of the time, these creatures need to be doused by Aqua Eructo to ensure jinxes can properly damage them.\n\nErkling - Elfish creatures which are native to Germany. They have pointed faces and a high-pitched cackle, and will try to shoot you with blow darts; the Bavarian kind is slightly more aggressive.\n\nBubotubers - Thick, green, slug-like plants that are covered in swellings filled with a corrosive pus that shoots out if jinxed or touched. Used to destroy obstacles via flinging them like a slingshot with Carpe Retractum, though they will often respawn as they cannot be destroyed permanently.\n\nBlast-Ended Skrewts - Creatures with thick armour and shoot fire out of their blasting ends. Can only be hit with jinxes from behind as a result, and unlike other creatures, can be stunned instantly if they crash into a wall on accident during their charge. Both young and adult versions appear were the size difference is notable.\n\nVampyr Mosp - Fanged wasp-moth hybrid. Giant insects with a curved stinger. Purple variants are less aggressive than red variants.\n\nHungarian Horntail - An extremely aggressive species of dragon.\n\nMushroom - (Possibly Horklumps.) Sending out toxic smoke that blocks the way. Can be destroyed if Bubotubers are flung at them with the Carpe Retractum Spell.\n\nGrindylow - A pale green, tentacled beast that lives in the weed beds on the bottom of lakes in Britain. It is also known as a water demon.\n\nMerpeople - Sentient water creatures that inhabit the Black Lake, resembling a fish-human hybrid.\n\nBowtruckle - A European tree-guardian. (GBA/Nintendo DS only)\n\nRed Cap - Dwarf-like creatures that live in holes on old battlegrounds or wherever human blood has been spilled. (GBA/Nintendo DS only)\n\nFire crab - Resembles a large tortoise with a heavily-jewelled shell. Native of Fiji. (GBA/Nintendo DS only)\n\nNiffler - This burrowing creature has a predilection for anything glittery. (GBA/Nintendo DS only)\n\nCharmed skeleton - Voldemort uses animated skeletons to attack Harry in the last level.\n\nItems[]\n\nBertie Bott's Every Flavour Beans - These beans can be found in the game. You can use the beans to buy cards, though getting hit will drop a certain amount of them when damaged by specific things. Red beans heal your stamina, while blue beans fill the Magicus Extremos metre.\n\nChocolate Frog Cards - Buy these cards to unlock special abilities.\n\nChocolate Frogs - If a human player faints, these will revive him or her. The game starts with 3 chocolate frogs. Cannot be summoned by Accio.\n\nCauldron Cakes and Pumpkin Pasties - They increase Harry, Ron or Hermione's stamina.\n\nPlot[]\n\nFor a complete synopsis see Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire.\n\nHarry Potter is unexpectedly chosen as a fourth contender for the title of Triwizard Tournament champion in his fourth year at Hogwarts. Over the course of the school year, he must learn the spells and tricks necessary for him to be able to get through three difficult tasks and, ultimately, escape the clutches of infamous evil wizard Lord Voldemort.\n\nBehind the scenes[]\n\nDifferent from the previous games, this one has just one version, and not different versions for different consoles.\n\nMany plot elements from the film and book do not appear in the game, such as Ron's jealousness of Hermione going out with Viktor Krum (which is only briefly noted in a cutscene in the handheld versions) or Ron having a row with Harry for the latter being chosen by the Goblet of Fire.\n\nMany of the characters from the book and film appear only in cameos or not at all, including Fleur Delacour, Madame Maxime, and Igor Karkaroff.\n\nThe Entrance Hall Antechamber can be seen in cutscenes, despite the fact that in the movie it was replaced by the Entrance Courtyard. The Entrance Courtyard is not featured at all.\n\nThis is the first game to feature a character been voiced by an actor from the actual movie, in this case Ralph Fiennes as Lord Voldemort.\n\nIn this game, the incantation for the Summoning Charm is pronounced \"ACK-see-oh\" as opposed to the pronunciation used in the films (\"ACK-ee-oh\"). This is corrected in the following game.\n\nWhen near a charm-able target, a small light appears above it with the colour established for the currently-controlled-character as of the prior game (Harry's is green, Hermione's is pink while Ron's is light-brown).\n\n[]\n\nNotes and references[]\n\nSee also[]\n\nHarry Potter and the Goblet of Fire\n\nHarry Potter and the Goblet of Fire (film)\n\nHarry Potter and the Goblet of Fire (soundtrack)\n\nHarry Potter and the Goblet of Fire (character index)\n\nJ.
