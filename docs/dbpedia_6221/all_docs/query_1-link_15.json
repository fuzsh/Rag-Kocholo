        "text": "Anyone keeping up with our coverage of the Harry Potter series knows the first batch of games weren't very action packed. Instead, each offered a platform-heavy puzzle-based experience. Most people compared the gameplay in these titles to some of the later installments in Nintendo's Zelda franchise in that both featured similar lock-on systems and exploration aspects. With the latest title though, and the first title to hit the PSP, Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire, EA has veered from established tacks and shot after a decidedly action oriented approach.\n\nEA has decided to make versions of Goblet of Fire for every platform on under the sun, including PS2, Xbox, GameCube, GBA, DS and PSP. But it's the PSP version we're most interested about since, well, this is a PSP site. To start, the PSP version looks and plays almost identical to the console versions. The game is structured the same way in terms of level design, narrative flow and the like, and there's very little sacrifice when it comes to visual detail. In fact, we'd even say Goblet of Fire is one of the more visually impressive games on the system.\n\nHere's a quick recap for those who need it: The Goblet of Fire splits between 11 locations from the film, each of which has several missions and sub-missions. We could choose to play as one of the three main characters in the film before jumping into each stage, with the other two characters delegated to CPU control. Unfortunately, the single-player story missions are strictly single-player. Like the book, the game follows Harry Potter as he and the Hogwartz School battle against two rival institutions for supremacy in the Tri-Wizard Tournament. This makes for a very different adventure than what fans may recall from earlier installments. And it's not just faster pacing due to action scenarios either, but the overall feel of the game is a little darker.\n\nThe first scenario stage has Harry, Hermione and Ron battle enemies who have invaded the Quidditch World Cup Camp Site. This specific stage helped demonstrate much of what differentiates Goblet of Fire from previous Potter games. First, there's a big emphasis on teamwork and action. Having a trio of young wizards helps in many situations such as combat or to remove roadblocks such as trees and boulders by using magic spells. We also needed to kill overgrown frogs with energy blasts from our magic wands. Having to extra characters helped make the task easier.\n\nUsing the Wingardium Leviosa spell to lift objects only works on stones and small boulders when used by a single wizard, but get three of them using the same spell on the same object garners impressive results. It's also pretty fun, not to mention cool looking, to pick up random stuff and hurl it toward enemies or chucking it randomly. We could choose to play as one of the three main characters in the film before jumping into each stage, with the other two characters delegated to CPU control. Unfortunately, the single-player story missions are strictly single-player.\n\nApart from lifting obstructions, we also had to use the Carp Retractum spell and physically pull items with the PSP's thumbstick to move large branches around the stage. The game has 3 different types of spells, including: Jinx , Charm and Axia. Charm spells help you manipulate the environment. Jinx spells help you attack enemies. And the lone Axia spell summons an entity. We didn't get to see the summon spell in action, unfortunately, so we can't really elaborate on it. It also serves to note this opening level looked pretty good. It seemed as though multi-colored explosions rocked the screen every few seconds. There were also nice environmental touches scattered throughout.\n\nLike most PSP releases, Goblet of Fire packs a bunch of exclusive mini-games that didn't make it into the console versions. There are three in all, all of which support the PSP's game sharing functionality. What this means, of course, is that owners of Goblet of Fire can share the mini-games with other PSP owners who haven't yet picked up a copy of the game. There's also a number of collectible Creature Cards unlocked during the single-player portion of the game that can also be shared with other PSPs wirelessly. These cards can be viewed just for fun, but also can be used in one of the exclusive mini-games.\n\nThe first mini-game, called Niffler Time Attack, drops ups in the role of a small, nimble creature and it's our job to navigate different courses under a strict time limit. There are eight different courses in all, each of which has a series of rings we needed to pass through before the timer ran out. Different courses have different obstacles, although that's not really what's challenging about the Niffler Time Attack; it's controlling the Niffler. He's a wily little thing and is somewhat hard to control. To help with the challenge are a series of power-ups strewn abut each course that add seconds to the clock.\n\nThe second mini-game, Dugbog Bulb Raid, had us protecting a cluster of creatures in the middle of a small arena-like stage while another group of (bad) creatures rushed us and tried to steal our precious cargo. This mini-game particular was pretty fun and features nine rounds in three different locations. Another mini-game, Exploding Snap, played out like a match game where we were shown a card and had to match it with another card belonging to a row of three. At first things were pretty easy, with the match card having an identical counterpart in our pool of three choices. Things later got a little harder because our choices became less clear and a little more obscure.\n\nWizard Pairs plays like a basic memory game. We're given a choice of 10 or so cards and can flip two over at a time. The goal, of course, is to match two cards. The game gets harder with every round won, though, and there are fewer chances to screw up. Plus, there's a timer. And with every round time gets shorter and shorter. As for the exclusive creature cards, we can apparently unlock the Niffler, Landscape Grindylow and Bubotuber by playing the Niffler Time Attack, but can also unlock the Landscape Skeleton, Landscape Mermaid and Bouncing Bulk by playing the Dugbog Bulb Raid. Again, these exclusive cards can be traded with fellow PSP owners wirelessly.\n\nSo there it is. Goblet of Fire looks good and plays well, but we'll need to look at the final build before handing out a verdict."
