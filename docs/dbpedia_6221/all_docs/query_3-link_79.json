        "text": "Sonyâs $200 PlayStation Portal is one step closer to being an actually fun device. Out of the box, the Portal can only stream games from a PS5, and users are barred from remotely accessing the companyâs sizable cloud gaming library service. But now, thanks to two Google engineers, you may soon be able to hack the Portal to run games from a much more useful 20-year-old system: the cult favorite PlayStation Portable, better known as the PSP.\n\nâAfter more than a month of hard work, PPSSPP is running natively on PlayStation Portal,â Andy Nguyen, a cloud vulnerability researcher at Google wrote on X/Twitter. âYes, we hacked it.â PPSSPP is the name of a popular PSP emulator.\n\nNguyen, who said he broke open the device with fellow Google engineer Calle Svensson, posted a picture of a Portal running Grand Theft Auto: Liberty City Stories. According to the engineer, itâs a software-based hack, meaning it doesnât require any soldering or other physical modifications.\n\nIt isnât clear whether Nguyen and his co-hackers plan to publish instructions for the exploit. He said thereâs âno release planned in the near future,â but that raises the chance that there may be one on the horizon. Regardless, the fact that the exploit is possible means independent hackers will double down on efforts to jailbreak the Portal. Sony did not immediately respond to a request for comment."
