        "text": "Set approximately 100 years before the events of Harry Potter, players attend Hogwarts as a fifth-year student as they embark on a dangerous journey to unearth the hidden truth of the magical world.\n\nDesigned as an open-world action RPG that includes the ability to fly brooms, explore Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry and learn magic, this is the game many have dreamt of for years.\n\nThat said, questions have loomed for months since Hogwarts Legacy's next-gen release on PlayStation, Xbox and PC: How will this perform on Switch? Can it even run on the console at all?\n\nMore like this\n\nA fair concern considering just how underpowered the Nintendo system is in comparison. Now we know the answer with plenty of screenshots, gameplay and hands-on experience telling all.\n\nSo, here's everything you need to know about Hogwarts Legacy on Switch, including its release date, where to get the game cheap and how the game performs on the Nintendo platform.\n\nSponsored by LEGO\n\nShop Harry Potter LEGO sets\n\nHarry Potter season is upon us! The Hogwarts Express has left Platform 9 ¾ and we’re getting ready to snuggle up in front of the telly for another wizard movie marathon.\n\nTo help get you in the spirit, why not check out some of the incredible Harry Potter sets now available at LEGO.\n\nThey’ve got everything from Dobby the House-elf minifugures to 4,000+ piece models of Gringotts. Plus, there are sets available for all ages and prices ranging from £4.99 from £429.99. Just Accio your purse and get spending!\n\nShop LEGO Harry Potter sets at LEGO\n\nWill Hogwarts Legacy come to Switch?\n\nYes, Hogwarts Legacy is now available on Nintendo Switch.\n\nAfter first releasing on PlayStation, Xbox and PC, the developers made this clear early on by including the Switch on the list of confirmed platforms on the Frequently Asked Questions page of the game's official website.\n\nThe game was delayed late on in development and arrived nine months after its competitors.\n\nHogwarts Legacy was released on Nintendo Switch on 14th November 2023. The Switch port was previously expected to roll out in July before being hit by a delay one month out from launch.\n\nThis is nine months after other platforms received the game, with the title launching on PC and current-gen consoles in February before then making its way to PS4 and Xbox One in April.\n\nWhere to buy Hogwarts Legacy on Switch\n\nYou can now pick up Hogwarts Legacy on Switch from Argos for £49.99, or get the Deluxe Edition with the Dark Arts Pack from GAME for £59.99.\n\nOn top of this, if you're keen for more Harry Potter action on Switch, don't forget that the LEGO Harry Potter games are available right now on Nintendo's handy hybrid console.\n\nYou can buy them for £30 or less from a wide range of retailers, if you check out the current deals in our magical widget below.\n\nWill Hogwarts Legacy on Switch be a cloud version?\n\nA cloud version of Hogwarts Legacy will not be coming to Nintendo Switch.\n\nThe game has been developed by Avalanche Games specifically for the platform, with many changes being implemented to make sure Hogwarts Legacy can run on Nintendo Switch.\n\nAn extra nine months of development time was allocated after the title arrived on next-gen in February 2023.\n\nHitman 3 and Marvel's Guardians of the Galaxy game, for example, were only available on Switch through the cloud — in other words, you had to be online if you wanted to play them.\n\nWhile many third-party studies have opted for cloud releases of their biggest games, there is no indication that Hogwarts Legacy will do the same.\n\nHow does Hogwarts Legacy perform on Switch?\n\nOne of the biggest questions surrounding Hogwarts Legacy on Switch is how it performs. From early hands-on experiences now that the game has launched, the general consensus is that it works - but sacrifices a lot in return.\n\nThe tech analysis experts at Digital Foundry described the port of Hogwarts Legacy as \"one of the most comprehensively downgraded games I've seen in the modern era\".\n\nMost notably, Avalanche has remodelled a lot of the environments and added several loading screens that were previously not present. One of these is found at the entry to Hogsmeade Village, taking close to 45 seconds to load in.\n\nIn general, loading is looking to take about 15 to 30 seconds.\n\nLighting has been stripped back, which affects the colour tone, while object details like statues, furniture and books have lost fidelity.\n\nThere are fewer assets/different ones implemented, as well - one instance has one wall closed off entirely instead of offering a view of the land.\n\nThe outdoor environment around Hogwarts features fewer trees, branches and scaled-back greenery. Additionally, draw distance has been pulled back, with the difference in water quality showing the last-gen to next-gen difference more than most.\n\nThe good news is that the game is fully playable, and the experience between handheld to docked is not that different. We'd personally recommend playing the game on another platform for how much you lose in return, but at least the option is there for those that want it.\n\nThe full Digital Foundry analysis can be watched below:\n\nYou can buy the game from Amazon or the retailer of your choice, or read more with the links below:\n\nHogwarts Legacy review - our full verdict\n\nHogwarts Legacy potions - all recipes to know\n\nHogwarts Legacy plants - what do they do?\n\nHogwarts Legacy level cap - how to spent talent points\n\nHogwarts Legacy trophies - the achievements you need\n\nHogwarts Legacy release date - staggered launch explained\n\nHogwarts Legacy cast - Simon Pegg and more\n\nHogwarts Legacy house sorting quiz - take the text\n\nHogwarts Legacy character creator - customisation revealed\n\nHogwarts Legacy common rooms - tour all four\n\nWho is Phineas Nigellus Black?
