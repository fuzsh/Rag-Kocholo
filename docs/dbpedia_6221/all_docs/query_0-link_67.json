        "text": "by: Chuck -\n\nMore On: E3 2009\n\nLike everyone else EA has unveiled their parade of games for this year's E3. Here's the full lineup:\n\nArmy of Two:The 40th Day (360, PS3, PSP)\n\nBattlefield: Bad Company 2 (360, PS3, PC)\n\nBrutal Legend (360, PS3)\n\nDante's Inferno (360, PS3, PSP)\n\nDead Space Extraction (Wii)\n\nDragon Age: Origins (360, PS3, PC)\n\nEA Sports Active (Wii)\n\nEA Sports: Grand Slam Tennis (Wii)\n\nFIFA 10 (360, PS3, Wii, PC, PS2, DS, PSP)\n\nFight Night Round 4 (360, PS3)\n\nGI Joe: The Rise of Cobra (360, PS3, Wii, PS2, PSP, DS)\n\nHarry Potter and the Half Blood Prince (360, PS3, Wii, PS2, PSP, DS, PC/Mac)\n\nMadden NFL 10 (360, PS3, PS2, PSP, Wii)\n\nMass Effect 2 (360, PC)\n\nLooks like a solid lineup to me. Interesting to see that Mass Effect 2 is still a 360/PC exclusive and that EA is going to make John happy by bringing Battlefield: Bad Company to the PC. After seeing the list I can see why John and I will be spending nearly three hours with EA next week. If there's something you really want coverage on leave it in the comments and we'll see what we can do."
