History[]

Tuesday, January 12, 1954, NRK conducted its first technical trial. The trial lasted 32 minutes and consisted of a clock with moving seconds and grids. Seansen was held at Marinlyst with the press present.

Sunday, February 3, 1957, NRK sent skating racing from the Bislett stadium with Halfdan Hegtun as a reporter. There were only 51 private individuals in Norway who had the television license when the broadcast went. Most who watched the championship on television saw it in various shop windows where retailers had televisions. The registration fee at that time was 5 kroner. Technically, NRK at this time was able to reach around one million people, mainly in Oslo, Vestfold and Østfold.

NRK started regular TV broadcasts on April 13, 1958. At that time there were eleven employees in NRK Fjernsynet: three on the program side and eight technicians. The three on the program side were Otto Nes, Anders Buraas and Oddvar Foss. On the technical, among others, chief engineer Torbjørn Navelsaker and chief engineer Kjell Løvaas.
