NRK will broadcast a comprehensive range of sporting action at the second edition of the Games and will also show the Opening Ceremony at the Lysgårdsbakkene Ski Jumping Arena.

The Ceremony will be held exactly 22 years to the day after the Opening Ceremony of the 1994 Winter Olympic Games was staged at the same venue.

NRK are due to show coverage of the brand-new cross-country cross event, as well as competition in snowboarding, ski cross, slopestyle snowboard, figure skating and short track speed skating.

They are also scheduled to show biathlon single mixed relay and the ice hockey skills challenge, an individual competition featuring fastest lap, shooting accuracy, skating agility, fastest shot, passing precision and puck control.

The broadcaster will also show ice hockey finals.

“This is maybe one of the biggest days for Lillehammer 2016 so far,” Lillehammer 2016 chief executive Tomas Holmestad said.

“The agreement with NRK will mean a lot for the reach of the event to a broad audience in Norway, and it’s something we’ve worked towards for a long time.

“We are proud to write a new Olympic chapter together with NRK.”

International broadcasting rights holders will also be able to gain access to coverage of the Winter Youth Olympic Games, which features 70 events across 15 disciplines, through Olympic Broadcasting Services, who will produce news packages and highlights.

As well as televised coverage, NRK mp3, a youth radio channel, will also have a presence during the Games, broadcasting live from downtown Lillehammer several hours daily.

“NRK is the home of Winter sports,” NRK executive sports editor Rune Haug said.

“With our ambition of being attractive to young audiences, the Youth Olympic Games in Norway is a great opportunity for us to present exciting sporting events.

“We look forward to presenting the Olympians of tomorrow.”
