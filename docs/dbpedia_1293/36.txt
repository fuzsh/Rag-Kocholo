NRK, the Norwegian public-service broadcaster, has unveiled a tie-up with media giant Warner Bros. Discovery (WBD) to provide full live athletics coverage from the Paris 2024 Olympic Games.

All events from the various athletics disciplines during next year’s summer Olympics will be shown live on NRK, while WBD will maintain its position as the exclusive rightsholder in Norway for every single event from the Paris games.

This tie-up follows on from NRK and WBD between them securing rights to all Olympic Games’ between 2026 and 2032, in January this year.

NRK will cover athletics events on both its linear platforms and on the NRK TV online service.

The Paris Olympics will run between July 26 and August 11, and in addition to TV rights covering the athletics, NRK also holds radio rights for all Olympic events.

Vibeke Fürst Haugen, broadcast manager at NRK, has said: “We believe that this news will benefit the Norwegian public, and look forward to conveying historic sporting achievements together with the talented people at Warner Bros. Discovery.”

Magnus Vatn, program director at WBD Norway, added: “Being able to hand over the baton to NRK for athletics now, we do so with pleasure and knowing that they will manage the right very well. This will be a foretaste of how we will collaborate on the Olympic Games in the future as well.”

WBD holds rights to all Olympic Games through the 2018-24 cycle in 50 European countries in a major deal unveiled in 2015 which is believed to be worth just under $1.5 billion in total.

During the last summer Olympics, in Tokyo three years ago, Norway secured eight medals in total, with three athletic golds.

For the Tokyo Games, action was also covered free-to-air by the VG broadcaster, through a late sub-licensing deal.
