        "text": "Try to watch NRK online, outside Norway, and chances are you’ll come across the message, “Ikke tilgjengelig utenfor Norge”. Which roughly translates as “Not available outside of Norway”. Region-locked websites and services are increasingly common, and are seen with streaming services such as Netflix, BBC iPlayer, and DAZN.

Our team of experts created a strict set of criteria to filter these out until only the best VPNs for NRK remained. Here’s a brief overview of what we looked for:\n\nNorwegian servers: NRK is region-locked, so you’ll need a Norwegian server to use it abroad. We considered how many of these were available, whether they were physical or virtual, and how many other server locations each VPN had to offer.\n\nHigh speeds: Sluggish speeds cause all kinds of problems, from long buffering times to random disconnection. We personally run nine speed tests per VPN and average the results to see how quick and consistent each provider’s performance is.\n\nSecurity and privacy: It’s not enough to be able to stream; you also have to be secure while doing so. That’s why we looked for VPNs with a no-logs policy, protection against IPv6 and DNS leaks, a kill switch, and 256-bit encryption. If more advanced security tools are included, that’s even better.\n\nStreaming ability: The main goal might be to watch NRK, but sooner or later, you’ll probably want to watch something else. Our team tests VPNs against a variety of Norwegian streaming services and international platforms like Netflix so we can say with confidence which are the most versatile.\n\nMulti-platform support: Users should be able to stream safely at all times, and that means finding VPNs that work with a wide range of popular devices and operating systems. We’re big fans of anything that reduces the barrier to entry even further, whether it’s 24/7 live chat, a lack of connection limits, or just beginner-friendly designs.\n\nValue for money: We’ll never recommend services that charge more than they’re worth. Additionally, we search high and low for any deals, discounts, free trials, or money-back guarantees, often claiming these for ourselves to make sure they’re really as straightforward as they seem.\n\nInterested in learning more?
