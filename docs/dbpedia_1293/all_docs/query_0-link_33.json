        "text": "Norwegian pay-television distributor RiksTV has agreed a new long-term carriage deal with the Discovery Networks Norway division of international media company Discovery Communications that will include coverage of the Tippeligaen, the top division of domestic football.\n\nUnder the deal, RiksTV will distribute via television and mobile devices all channels that Discovery plans to utilise for its new six-year football rights deal, which was signed in December and runs from 2017 to 2022.\n\nUnder the deal with the Norwegian Football Association and Norsk Toppfotball, Discovery’s channels will also show coverage of the second-tier OBOS-ligaen. Discovery Networks Norway operates channels such as Eurosport Norway, TVNorge and Max.\n\nDiscovery plans to provide football coverage primarily through Eurosport Norway and Max, but will also use TVNorge to broadcast games on a regular basis.\n\nChristian Birkeland, chief executive of RiksTV, said: “We are very pleased to have landed football distribution with Discovery. Football engages and we can offer this on all platforms, making sure the games are available regardless where customers are in the country through one fixed subscription price.”"
