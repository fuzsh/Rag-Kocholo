        "text": "FIS Ski’s mission is “To be the inspiration and catalyst which drives the appeal of competitive and recreational snowsports in a more sustainable manner”. At the same time the Alpine World Cup organized by FIS is responsible for huge amounts of greenhouse gas emissions each year. Other structural concerns also negatively impact the sport’s sustainability by harming athletes’ physical and mental health, providing an unfair advantage to athletes with lucrative sponsor deals, and leaving national teams from smaller countries in financial difficulties.\n\nThe most effective way for FIS to address all of these problems at once is to create a World Cup calendar which creates predictability in income and costs, protects the welfare of athletes and staff, and minimizes greenhouse gas emissions from travelling while making it possible for individual teams and athletes to make their own further remissions reducing decisions.\n\nThe calendars proposed below are set up to minimize travel needs, have a higher likelihood of natural snow, promote athlete welfare and staff working conditions, and maintain high public interest in alpine skiing as long as possible throughout the season.\n\nIn order to measure emission reductions from the proposed new calendars, KPMG has calculated emissions from both the actual calendar from the 22/23-season and the newly proposed calendar. To be able to sufficiently compare the two calendars, KPMG has created a hypothetical scenario where one athlete travels to all competitions (regardless of them being cancelled) alongside a coach and a service man. Additionally, the athlete only travels by plane, diesel car or transporter (to transport equipment).\n\nKPMG’s analysis has shown that the proposed calendars for the men- and women teams would have the potential to make significant reductions to the climate emissions from travelling and transport for the Norwegian national teams. The men’s team’s emissions could be reduced by as much as 29% of the total travel emissions, per year, while the women’s teams emissions could be cut by approximately 14%. Further explanation of methodology of calculations and comments on results can be found in Appendix.\n\nThe proposed World Cup calendars begin in North America in late November. This could further allow for combining competitions in North America with the fall training camps in Chile in the future, hence reducing the number of times that athletes, staff and equipment travels across the Atlantic throughout the season. However, these are potential emissions reductions that are dependent on national team decisions, and not included in these calculations. When comparing emissions between the two calendars, it is assumed that the athletes start the WC-season in Oslo.\n\nA noticeable change in the proposed calendar is that all the North American runs take place in the first phase of the season, and the men’s teams do not travel across the Atlantic again later in the season (in the 22/23 season this occurred in February).\n\nAfter the first runs in North America, both the men’s and women’s teams travel to Europe, where they compete in another geographical cluster. In the proposed calendar, the men’s teams travel to the Western Alps leading up to Christmas and the women’s teams to the Eastern Alps.\n\nAfter Christmas, the Classic’s Tour kicks off in Austria, for both the men’s and women’s teams. This tour continues after New Year’s until the end of January.\n\nAt the end of January, the men’s teams would head south for the Southern Alps, and the women’s teams would embark on the Western Alps, before there is a break in the calendar for two weeks for the World Championships.\n\nIn the middle of March, both teams would head on to the Scandinavia Tour, where there are typically still good snow conditions later in the season. Finally, at the beginning of April the season finale held in Soldeu for both the men’s and women’s teams. Soldeu is chosen as the example location for the season finale as this was the case for the 22/23-season. For future World Cups, location of the season finale is expected to be rotated between various cities and areas with suitable conditions.\n\nHolding competitions in geographical clusters will reduce the environmental impact of the World Cup season and reduce the necessary travel time for athletes and staff – allowing for more recovery time, improving athletes’ overall experience.\n\nThis measure will reduce greenhouse gas emissions in several ways. First, it will reduce the need for athletes and staff to fly from one competition to another, where they are required to travel long distances and still have adequate recovery time. It will also minimize the travelling needs for media workers, volunteers, and FIS staff. Lastly, the necessary transport of athletes’ equipment will be minimized through clustering. At the time of this report, the only available travel data was for the Norwegian Ski Federation’s own travel. Hence, it is not possible to calculate total potential emission reductions from implementing this measure. However, they are expected to be significant.\n\nIt should be noted that this measure should not be taken too far. Insights from interviewing Norway’s paralympic team shows that holding too many competitions in the same place over a short period of time can lead to a lack of variety in the runs, give an unfair advantage to certain athletes, and increase athlete load. Having too many similar competitions can also be experienced as repetitive and boring, resulting in limited interest in the sport. Therefore, it is important to specify that several runs should be held in the same geographical region, but with variety in disciplines and characteristics of the slope.\n\nAdditionally, when designing the calendar, FIS should take a cluster approach for the para-teams as well. While this approach involves holding runs closer together geographically for the men’s and women’s teams, it would be slightly different for the para-teams. Rather than going to one place, and staying there for several weeks, their runs should be held across larger geographical areas – while still clustered in the same region to limit flying and travel time – to offer more variability.\n\nThis assessment has not covered calculations of emissions linked to the individual venues and competitions during the World Cup. Preliminary calculations made in dialogue with the organizers at Kvitfjell nevertheless indicate that the most material sources of emissions at a typical WC-event is travel for crew and organizers, and snow production. More analysis and data is necessary to verify this assumption, but significant emission reductions are likely if the racing calendar included more combined events, synergies and more economies of scale.\n\nTo reduce emissions FIS should thus explore options for more combined events for the men’s, women’s and para-teams. Combined events could result in more efficient resource use and will likely reduce the total greenhouse gas emissions generated by the World Cup, since runs will be used more times once they are prepared. It would likely also limit the total amount of equipment and crew that needs to be transported to the area the events will be held and will, in some cases, reduce the amount of traveling required by team staff between events.\n\nHowever, arranging combined events is not necessarily simple or even feasible and low-hanging fruit in all cases. There are significant, practical constraints, due to technical requirements and aspects such as available accommodation for athletes, transportation, workload on volunteers, and slopes withstanding a high level of usage from, for example, all men and women teams. These are very real limitations to the viability of combined WC-events, especially between men’s and women’s teams, and our recommendation is therefore for FIS and WC organizers to consider arranging an increased number of combined events at locations where this is assessed to be practically possible.\n\nOn the other hand, creating World Cup calendars that more systematically ensures that competitions “shadow” each other appears to have significant potential. This is especially the case for the para-teams and the women’s teams as well as for the E-cup calendar. Synergies and systematic shadowing would here greatly improve the World Cup quality for para-athletes. Consultations in the development of these recommendations have documented that the athletes experience that events co-organized with (within a week prior to or after) women’s events are typically the events with the best conditions in the season. Adopting this approach in a more way could both reduce emissions and improve competition quality for athletes. Some organizers already have experience and success with this, where both Kvitfjell and Kitzbühel biannually are hosting E-cup events the week after World Cup event.\n\nLong distance training camps generate a large share of the travel emissions for both the Norwegian men’s and women’s national teams.\n\nWith the current competition calendar, trips to New Zealand and Chile are essential to the athletes. This is especially important for downhill skiers, as they need extensive training at high speed in preparation for the season opening. Due to snow conditions in Europe in August/ September, it is difficult to get sufficient training at an equal level of quality here. Not being sufficiently prepared for the season impacts negatively on the teams’ ability to compete and increases the risk of sustaining serious injuries.\n\nAdjusting the World Cup calendar (namely, by moving the season opening to mid-November and locating to North America) makes it easier consider alternative training plans that reduce emissions. These could include, for example, training in Chile in the weeks leading up to a season opening in North America and travelling directly to the competition, limiting the teams’ cross-Atlantic travel to one trip per year. Other changes could also be made and considered.\n\nThere are significant disadvantages in being a first mover in this respect. To unilaterally avoid travels to training camps at long-distance locations like Chile and New Zealand comes at a great price. Thus, from a competitive perspective, the Norwegian national team would not accept the risk of undermining their ability to compete at level terms. If all major national teams came to a collaborative agreement and collectively agreed on limiting long-distance training camps, and/ or the snow conditions made this feasible, the Norwegian national teams would look favorably at making more fundamental changes to the pre-season training.\n\nEmissions reduction – Postponing the start of the World Cup and moving the opening to North America has the potential to lead to significant emissions reductions, as the season opening may even be combined with training trips to Chile. Additional effects might also be achieved through reduce emissions due to a reduced need for artificial snow creation.\n\nCost and economic impact – The direct costs of delaying the World Cup opening and moving it to North America are small. For many teams the potential synergies between training and competition in North America might even reduce costs. However, the World Cup opening is an important marketing event and either delaying or moving its location could lead to resistance from organizers and equipment manufacturers that may experience decreased revenues.\n\nCollaboration – This would require significant collaboration involving many different entities. Changing the World Cup calendar is determined by FIS, which themselves needs to consider a range of important stakeholders like sponsors, TV rights holders, organizers, national teams, etc.\n\nQuality and competitiveness – Delaying the World Cup start will not reduce the competitiveness of any athletes, as they will all be impacted equally. On the other hand, the Norwegian men’s and women’s national teams indicated that delaying the World Cup start would improve their experience, as they would prefer more training time and more natural snow than they get now.\n\nSafety and working conditions – Delaying the World Cup opening will not have a direct effect on athlete safety. However, it could result in fewer cancellations and thus fewer closely scheduled competitions which would reduce the physical load placed on athletes. This is uncertain, however, as there could still be cancellations in an updated calendar.\n\nWeather and climate – This measure is considered possible given weather and climate conditions. In fact, it would make the competition calendar more resilient to the expected coming climate change, as a delayed start will mean colder weather and moving the opening to locations in North America which typically have snow early will compound this effect.\n\nEmissions reduction – This measure does not directly reduce emissions, but makes it more likely that FIS will be able to set up a calendar with lower travel emissions.\n\nCost and economic impact – In the long term, this measure is likely to reduce costs due to operational and travel efficiencies. There will, however, likely be some upfront costs to set up the process. On the other hand, the measure will improve the predictability of revenue and economic stability for organizers and national teams as they will know long in advance which years they will hold World Cup events.\n\nCollaboration – Implementing this measure would require significant collaboration with FIS and the national ski organizations.\n\nQuality and competitiveness – Assuming this measure is implemented along with measure 3, it is expected to lead to a more balanced calendar which will improve the athlete experience. Additionally, planning the calendar 4 years in advance will lead to more stability and make it easier for organizers to plan high quality events.\n\nSafety and working conditions – This measure will make it easier for FIS to plan a calendar that both secure and promote athlete welfare and is therefore expected, if implemented along with measure 3, to improve safety and working conditions.\n\nWeather and climate – This measure is not dependent on any weather conditions nor climate. It is also expected to increase the extent to which weather and climate are taken into account in setting the World Cup calendar.\n\nEmissions reduction – This measure, if implemented as suggested, will lead to significant emissions reductions as it will mean a calendar setting process that explicitly aims to schedule events near each other and limit travel needs.\n\nCost and economic impact – In the long term this measure is expected to reduce costs due to travel and operational costs. However, in the short term, there will be some upfront costs due to the calendar setting process becoming more extensive. There will also be some costs to event organizers who will likely have to increase their environmental monitoring and possibly even engage external experts.\n\nCollaboration – Implementing this measure will require high levels of collaboration among FIS, all national teams involved, and event organizers.\n\nQuality and competitiveness – This measure will lead to a more balanced calendar, taking into consideration athlete welfare, travel optimization, weather and snow conditions, balancing disciplines, and creating interest around the sport. It is therefore expected to improve the quality of the season for athletes.\n\nSafety and working conditions – This measure will bring an explicit focus on athlete safety and mental health into the calendar setting process, which is expected to reduce the physical load they are placed under and improve their overall working conditions.\n\nWeather and climate – This measure is not impacted by weather conditions or the climate and will lead to a competition calendar that is more aligned with the weather and more resilient to climate change.\n\nEmissions reduction – Holding competitions in geographical clusters is expected to reduce greenhouse gas emissions in a several ways. Firstly, it will reduce the need for athletes and staff to fly long distances when travelling from one competition to another. It will also minimize the need to fly for others, including media, volunteers, FIS staff, those responsible for transporting athletes’ equipment. At the time of this report, the only available travel data was for the Norwegian Ski Federation’s own travel. Hence, it is not possible to calculate the potential emission reduction from implementing this measure, but they are expected to be significant. This measure is especially relevant for competitions in North America, as it would significantly reduce emissions by only travelling one time across the Atlantic Ocean.\n\nHolding competitions in geographical clusters would also make it possible for individual teams and athletes to prioritize low greenhouse gas emissions in their decision making. Some athletes today, for example, travel by private helicopter and plane because it allows them more recovery time and provides a competitive advantage. A clustered calendar would limit this advantage and the felt need for it.\n\nCost and economic impact –This measure is expected to reduce travel costs for national teams, individuals, and FIS. At the same time, it will likely mean that some event organizers, or even entire regions, do not get World Cup events (or the corresponding income) every year. This loss of revenue in specific years would be somewhat mitigated by longer term revenue predictability due to the calendar being planned in 4-year blocks, if implemented along with measure 2.\n\nCollaboration – This measure will require collaboration within FIS and event organizers. The measure is increasingly likely to succeed if it is adopted along with measure 2.\n\nQuality and competitiveness – Based on insights from athletes in workshops, holding competitions in geographical clusters is expected to improve the quality for themselves. This is mainly due to improved recovery and overall experience through reduced travel time.\n\nHolding competitions in geographic clusters for the para team, rather than holding many in the same place in a row, is also expected to greatly improve the quality for these athletes. This is because it would increase the variation of the ski runs in their season and reduce the advantage that certain athletes get when the calendar weighted towards their specialty.\n\nSafety and working conditions – Holding the competitions in geographical clusters will mean that more time can be devoted to recovery, which will reduce the physical load the athletes are placed under and will likely reduce the risk of injury. This will also reduce the travel time, and thus improve the working conditions, for coaches and other staff.\n\nWeather and climate – Weather and climate conditions will need to be considered when scheduling runs, but this measure is generally considered possible to adopt given weather and climatic conditions.\n\nEmissions reduction – Moving the World Championship from early February to early March does not have any direct effect on emissions. It might indirectly reduce emissions because it would allow for specific runs that are currently held with bad snow conditions (and therefore using artificial snow) to be held in February, when there is more natural snow, reducing the total energy use by cutting artificial snow production.\n\nCost and economic impact –This measure is not expected to have an impact on the costs associated with the World Cup. It may, however, impact the revenue from World Cup runs. Stakeholders who were consulted during this project were optimistic that holding the World Cup in March would lead public interest in the sport lasting longer in the season, meaning the February World Cup runs have the potential to bring in more revenue than they would if they were held after the World Championships. It would also have a positive impact on athletes, who are paid more by sponsors for their performance before February 15, as it would allow them to fit in more World Cup runs before this date. However, events held after the World Championship are expected to generate lower income and interest, which would be a challenge in this measure.\n\nCollaboration –Moving the World Championships to March would require the agreement of a long list of different actors in alpine skiing, and the practical side would need cooperation for an even longer list, including – for example – the media.\n\nQuality and competitiveness – Moving the World Championship to early March is not expected to a have significant direct impact on the quality of the experience for athletes.\n\nSafety and working conditions – Moving the World Championship to early March is not expected to have a significant impact on the safety or working conditions for athletes or staff. There would still be the same number of total competitions within the same timeframe, this measure only changes the order they occur in.\n\nWeather and climate – There are locations that can host the World Championship at the beginning of March, so weather and climate are not likely to present problems for implementing this measure.\n\nEmissions reduction – Holding more combined events for the men’s and women’s teams at the same locations, or at least in locations that are near each other, is expected to lead to a small reduction in greenhouse gas emissions – dependent on how the measure is implemented. The men’s and women’s teams largely have their own coaches and staff, but holding the events near each other or at the same place will reduce the amount of travel certain key staff members need to do. This is especially relevant for the smaller national teams, who are more likely to have coaches and staff members that are essential to both the men’s and women’s teams. These effects would be more pronounced if the competitions were held in the same locations and not just within the same region.\n\nHolding combined men’s and women’s events may also reduce the total emissions from run preparation and artificial snow production.\n\nHolding para competitions directly after the women’s competitions also has the potential to reduce total emissions, as the runs are already prepared and the equipment would already be in place. This may also lead to a reduction in artificial snow emissions.\n\nCost and economic impact –This measure is expected to lead to some minor cost savings, due to operational efficiencies. It may also lead to increased revenue as these combined events will likely draw more media attention and higher viewership. For the para-teams this might result in a moderate increase of travel costs during the season, but it could be argued that this is a cost-effective way to season/ competition quality.\n\nCollaboration – This measure will require significant collaboration to implement, as holding more combined events will require approval from FIS, and the practical work will require coordination between the women’s, men’s and para’s staffs. Additionally, on the organizer side it will also require coordination between many different actors.\n\nQuality and competitiveness – Holding more combined events is expected to improve the experience for athletes as it will likely result in a better competition quality as well as better atmosphere around the competitions. This is especially true for the para team, as the athletes have stated that their best organized competitions have been those that were held directly following the women’s competitions on the same courses. Competition quality could also be negatively impacted if combined events are arranged at venues where conditions are not appropriate for this.\n\nSafety and working conditions – This method is not expected to have an impact on athlete or staff safety or working conditions.\n\nWeather and climate – This measure is not directly related to weather or climate conditions, although it could make it easier to plan the calendar around weather conditions as FIS would only need to find one suitable location for multiple events.\n\nEmissions reduction – Minimizing long distance travel and training sessions in the southern hemisphere is expected to significantly reduce the national teams’ emissions, with the level of emissions saved dependent on the reduction/restructuring of travelling.\n\nThe impact of this measure would be at its highest if European teams were able to completely eliminate long-distance training camps and train exclusively in Europe. This would, however, have other negative implications and seems less feasible today. A secondary option that will minimize emissions, is to coordinate timing and locations between fall training and season opening. This would be especially effective if measure 1 was implemented and the season opening was held in North America. The national teams could then train in North America (e.g. Copper Mountain) before the first competitions – which would limit travel needs to only two inter-continental flights per year. Alternatively, teams could train in Chile before heading to North America – which would involve three inter-continental flights. Both of these scenarios would represent a significant reduction in emissions.\n\nCost and economic impact – Minimizing long distance travel would reduce national team travel costs.\n\nCollaboration – Reducing or eliminating long distance training camps is a decision that each individual team can make. However, it will require the agreement of many people including athletes and coaches so there is some collaboration required. Additionally, although it is technically possible to implement alone, it is unlikely that any individual team would be willing to do so. Thus, the full adoption of this measure would likely require significant collaboration between teams.\n\nQuality and competitiveness – Based on the level of implementation for this measure, it may weaken the competitiveness of the national teams if they were to train in bad snow conditions in Europe while other teams travel to other parts of the world. The Norwegian para team already trains in Switzerland and Austria leading up to the World Cup, and some athletes have stated that they would be better prepared for the season if they could train in Chile or New Zealand.\n\nTo address this issue, the pre-season training trip can be combined with the potential season opening in North America, which would still allow athletes to train on real snow.\n\nThere can be no doubt that completely eliminating the training camps in Chile and New Zealand would negatively impact the athlete experience. Even if adequate snow conditions could be found in Europe before the season opening, athletes have indicated that these camps are important to them. However, limiting these longdistance training camps to training in Chile in August and in North America right before a World Cup opening in North America could be a potential compromise.\n\nSafety and working conditions – If training camps in Chile and New Zealand were cancelled without finding adequate replacements, this measure would have a substantial negative impact on athlete safety. Alpine skiers are dependent on adequate preparation before the season begins to be able to safely compete, with some arguing that the injuries in the 2023-2024 season are partly due to lack of preparation. This risk would need to be addressed in the implementation of this measure, to ensure that athlete safety does not decline as a result of changing the training schedule.\n\nWeather and climate – Climate and weather is highly relevant for this measure. Climate change is making it harder to find good training conditions in Europe in the fall, and this problem is only expected to get worse. Thus, it is uncertain from a climate perspective whether good alternatives for training camps can be found in Europe or North America.\n\nEmissions reduction – This effectiveness of this measure is dependent on whether or not FIS creates a calendar with competitions organized in geographical clusters. If this were the case, and athletes and staff stayed it the area for the entire cluster rather than travelling home every time there was enough time to do so between events, this measure could significantly reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Even a reduction in the number of annual trips home throughout the season would have an impact on emissions.\n\nThis measure has less of an impact however, if the World Cup calendar is not set up in clusters and the athletes and staff frequently need to fly long distances anyway.\n\nCost and economic impact – This measure is expected to reduce travel costs for individuals and national teams but may increase overall costs due to the cost of spending the night near competition locations.\n\nCollaboration – This measure in and of itself would not require collaboration beyond coordination at the national team level to ensure athletes and staff have somewhere to stay between competitions.\n\nQuality and competitiveness – This measure has the potential to worsen the World Cup experience for athletes who implement it and negatively impact their competitiveness.\n\nSafety and working conditions – Reducing travel home between competitions is not expected to have an impact on athlete safety, although it is expected to negatively impact overall working conditions. Athletes have stated that it is much easier to relax at home than in hotels while on the road. This is a challenge that must be actively addressed.\n\nWeather and climate – This measure is not impacted by weather and climate.\n\nEmissions reduction – Using lower means of transport with lower emissions when possible, such as electric vehicles or train, could moderately reduce emissions. The impact of this measure will depend on the transportation method that would’ve otherwise been used and to which extent the electric vehicle, or train, is being used.\n\nCost and economic impact –This measure is not expected to have a significant economic impact. Currently, the national teams are sponsored by Audi. The car manufacturer has previously communicated that they would only produce electric vehicles from 2026 but later changed their ambition to also continue offering vehicles with internal combustion engines. However, it is possible that Audi would provide the team with electric vehicles when more infrastructure is in place, in order to reach their own climate ambitions. In that case, the economic impact is expected to be minor.\n\nCollaboration – Implementation of this measure would require some collaboration at this point of time. This is mainly due to electric vehicles requiring more time used on charging due to lacking charging infrastructure, which would lead to loss of competitiveness for athletes if this wasn’t also followed by other national teams. If the necessary infrastructure is established throughout Europe, the level of required collaboration will be reduced.\n\nQuality and competitiveness – If the World Cup calendar organized in clusters with shorter distances between competitions, this measure would not have a material impact on athlete competitiveness. With the World Cup calendar as it is today, athletes who chose to travel by using lower impact means of transportation, such as trains or electric vehicles, would be at a competitive disadvantage because of the required time used on charging. This limits recovery time between events, which weakens athletes competitiveness.\n\nSafety and working conditions – As with quality and competitiveness, selecting lower impact means of transportation would not be expected to have an effect on safety and working conditions if the calendar was set up in geographic clusters. Similarly, it would negatively impact athlete safety and working conditions by reducing recovery time if it was implemented with the calendar as it is now.\n\nWeather and climate – This measure is generally considered to be possible given weather and climate considerations. That being said, electric cars do not work optimally in very cold environments, which could be a problem. There would always have to be some gasoline or diesel powered cars in the vehicle fleet to ensure that athletes and staff can complete necessary travels through the season.\n\nEmissions reduction – Conducting partial or full greenhouse gas accounting for the national teams and competition organizers is not expected to have any direct effects on greenhouse gas emissions. The insight gained from this analysis will, however, make it possible to identify more important emissions sources and take action to reduce or eliminate them in the future.\n\nCost and economic impact – This measure will likely require hiring someone to conduct the greenhouse gas accounts, paying for a system which someone will have to learn how to use, or engaging external experts to do the work.\n\nCollaboration – This measure does not require any collaboration and is a step that each individual team and organizer can take independently.\n\nQuality and competitiveness – This measure is not expected to have any impact on event quality or athlete competitiveness.\n\nSafety and working conditions – This measure is not expected to have any impact on safety or working conditions.\n\nWeather and climate – This measure’s implementation is not expected to be impacted by weather or climate conditions.\n\nParticipating in the World Cup requires extensive travel and equipment transport, which generates large amounts of greenhouse gas emissions.\n\nOver the 2022/2023 season, the men’s elite team’s travel to competitions and training camps generated emissions of greenhouse gasses estimated at just under 300 tons of carbon dioxide equivalents (CO2e). For comparison, one person flying round trip to Bergen generates approximately 166kg, or 0.166 tons, of CO2e. The pre-season training trip to New Zealand generated the most emissions (68 tons CO2e) of any individual trip, accounting for almost a quarter (23%) of the total emissions for the season. Training camps to New Zealand and Chile are scheduled to enable trainings on real snow before the World Cup season. This is the main reason that the Norwegian men’s national team, as well as national teams from other countries, travels to the Southern Hemisphere for training. As snow conditions in Europe are not reliable in the early fall, and there are limited ski runs in the world that are long enough and steep enough for athletes to reach the speeds they need to train for competitions, these trips are viewed as necessary. Other trips with high emissions include those to Palisades Tahoe, Copper Mountain, and Beaver Creek in the US. Competitions that are held in geographical clusters tended to generate lower travel emissions, as the athletes didn’t have to fly to the next competition and tended to stay in the area between competitions. This is seen in, for example, Val Gardena and Madonna di Campiglio.\n\nThe Norwegian women’s elite team emitted a total of 224 tons of CO2e due to travel for the 2022/2023 season. Similarly to the men’s team, the pre-season training camp to Chile was the largest single source of emissions (79 tons of CO2e), making up 35% of the team’s total emissions. Also as with the men’s team, this training camp has been set up to ensure the athletes get sufficient speed training before the World Cup starts, at a time of year when snow conditions in Europe are not reliably good. Other trips with high emission levels include those to Killington and Copper Mountain in the US as well as trips to Levi and Soldeu. For the US trips, long flights and a high number of travelers are the most significant driving factors for emissions, while for the Levi and Soldeu trips, many travelers and driving distances with the transporter contribute to emissions. The results from the women’s team are similar to those of the men’s team in terms of certain trips leading to high emissions and significantly lower emission levels resulting from competitions held close to each other in the same time period.\n\nAnalysis of the national teams’ means of transportation shows that flights account for most of the teams’ total emissions, respectively 84% (men’s team) and 79% (women’s team). For the women’s team, travel by transporter (small van) accounts for 13% of their emissions, and diesel cars account for the remaining 8%. The men’s team uses the transporter less, as this only accounts for 4% of their emissions, while diesel cars account for 12%.\n\nThese results indicate that when developing actions to reduce the teams' emissions, the most significant sources are flights, especially long-distance trips, followed by possible ways to reduce emissions from road transport. We have chosen to place our emphasis on measures and actions that will address the main emission drivers. Climate action and impact is our focus, but the measures we suggest have also been assessed in other aspects, such as their possible economic and safety impact. This will be elaborated on later in the report.\n\nIt should be noted that the emission calculations are based on travel data from the Ski Federation and the athletes themselves, and as such, the data’s scope and completeness has not been scrutinized by KPMG and is presumed to be representative of the teams’ actual emissions. Controlling and assuring the absolute accuracy of the data has not been prioritized, as the data quality is viewed as sufficient and has primarily been used to identify the most emissionintensive aspects and calculations that might serve as a basis for the identification of actions.\n\nTo be able to compare emission differences in the actual calendar and the proposed new structure, KPMG have constructed two hypothetical scenarios, one for each respective calendar.\n\nFor both calendars, we use the following assumptions:\n\nThe team consists of one athlete, one coach and a service worker.\n\nThe travel team consists of one athlete, one coach and a service worker.\n\nThis team is assumed to travel to all locations on the World Cup Calendar, regardless of possible cancellations or competition type. It should be noted that this travel pattern is not viewed as representative of all alpine athletes. It does, however, enable comparability between the two calendars, where other variables than the location of events and means of transportation are kept alike.\n\nWhen travelling by road it is assumed that the team use one diesel car and a transporter (small van >7m3). Flights over the Atlantic includes three people, while flights in Europe mainly includes the coach and the athlete, with the transporter either driving to Oslo or the next location.\n\nTravelling patterns in both calendars are decided based on what is considered as “natural” travelling behavior for a person entering all these competitions. This has led to some different return trips back to Oslo, although the number of trips are the same:\n\nWomen – Actual- and new calendar: 8 returns home\n\nMen – Actual- and new calendar: 7 returns home\n\nFor all calendars, the team is assumed to begin their season from Oslo. As highlighted by measure 7, re-structuring the pre-season training and start the season in North America would enable athletes to travel directly from training camps in either Chile or Copper Mountain to the first competition of the season. However, this possibility is not taken into account when comparing the emissions of calendars.\n\nIn terms of calendar differences, the men’s event in Cortina d’Ampezzo is replaced by Åre in order to enable the Scandinavian tour at the end of their season. For the women, both calendars consist of the same events but they’re in different orders. In relation to cancellations, the proposed calendar changes includes no “blank week” for cancellations. The thought is, however, that either the first or last competitions of tours can be held as tentative, in preparation for possible cancellations earlier in the season. This could for example be Kranjska Gora or Bormio.\n\nThe selection of locations used in the calculation of emissions generated through the new calendar structure, are the actual competition venues from the 22/23 season. Implementing a new calendar would likely also include a change in the selection of venues in order to cater for seasonal snow conditions and the practical feasibility at the respective locations. It is thus likely that FIS would achieve even greater reductions of emissions if an optimization of venue locations and seasonal snow conditions was ensured in a criteria-based process. In this exercise the 22/23 locations were used to ensure comparability, and to demonstrate the isolated impact of a calendar revisions without any other changes. The calculations are thus based on actual venues, while the proposed calendar is limited to specifying only the regions where competitions would be held during specific periods in the season, as the aim is to highlight the benefits of arranging competitions in regional clusters. For future World Cup calendars, the locations and timing of competitions will change each year and must consider snow conditions and the probability of cancellation due to weather, on each respective location."
