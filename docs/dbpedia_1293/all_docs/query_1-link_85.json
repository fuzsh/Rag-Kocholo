        "text": "Defending Olympic champion Jakob Ingebrigsten and his brothers Henrik and Filip have added “pop star” to their resume. Ahead of the Opening Ceremony for the Paris Olympics, the three Norwegian track star siblings released a music video they made with the Norwegian broadcaster NRK.\n\nThe single, Ingen gjør det bedre, translating to “Nobody does it better,” is a bona fide bop, and features archival footage of Norwegian Olympians competing at Games past, set against sweeping views of the brothers singing and dancing on a mountaintop—and looking cool.\n\nIt’s a Eurovision-worthy performance by the boy band trio, who are calling themselves “The IngebritZ,” and even non-Norwegian speakers will find themselves jamming along to the song (which is available on Spotify).\n\nThe chorus, translated to English, goes:\n\nNorwegian people\n\nToday we make the king proud\n\nToday we make the king proud\n\nWhen we loft the gold up\n\nNorwegian people\n\nToday we make the king proud\n\nToday we make the king proud\n\nWhen we loft the gold up\n\nNobody does it better\n\nHenrik and Filip are accomplished middle distance runners who have competed at the Olympics and World Championships, but right now, it’s Jakob who will soon have a chance to prove those lyrics. He’s the reigning Olympic gold medalist in the 1500 meters and will be doubling in Paris in both the 1500 and 5,000 meters.\n\nFilip told NRK that the song is “primarily for fun,” and hopes it can be played at the stadium and at after parties. We’re Team USA over here, but the song does its job so well, it may have you rooting for Norway after two and a half minutes under the dulcet spell of The IngebritZ."
