A native of Bonyhad, Hungary, Forman is a veteran of 15 seasons of coaching volleyball. Regarded as one of the sports' top tacticians, Forman came to Starkville from Waco, Texas, where he served in 2003 as an assistant coach at Baylor University. At Mississippi State, Forman works primarily with Bulldog setters. He also assists with the coordination and evaluation of team practices, directs opponent scouting and tape exchange, team travel, and oversees MSU's international recruiting efforts. Prior to his coaching stint at Baylor, Forman established himself as one of Europe's top volleyball coaches during a successful coaching run at the international level. During 1990, 1991, 1994 and 1999 his club teams finished among the top eight in the European Championships and won the Central European Championship in 2000. He returned to his native Hungary this summer to serve as head coach of the Hungarian Men's National Team, which defeated Serbia-Montenegro, runners-up in in 2005 World League Championships. Forman, 40, also enjoyed a successful two-year term as head coach for the Hungarian Junior National Team in 1992 and 1993 before taking the helm of the Hungarian Women's National Team for four years. His 1993 Junior National Team finished 10th in the 1992 European Championship and went on to place fifth in the World Championship held in Brazil. Four years later he guided the Hungarian Senior National Team to wins over host Canada, Germany, and the United States en route to a first-place finish in the 1997 Canada Cup. After graduating from Semmelweis University in Hungary in 1989, Forman began his coaching career as the head coach of the Vasas Sports Club. He guided that team to the 1990 Hungarian Cup title and a fifth-place finish in the European Championships. A year later, while serving on the staff with famed Chinese coach Sun De Lee, Forman's Vasas team again captured the Hungarian Cup and posted another fifth-place finish in the European Championships. He then returned to his alma mater, Semmelweis University, where he served from 1991 until 1999 as an assistant professor in physical education and sports sciences. During his first two years there he coached the Budapest school's volleyball team, posting top eight finishes in the Hungarian Championships in both 1992 and 1993. Forman returned to club volleyball coaching the next season, guiding Tungsram Sport Club to a runner-up finish in the Hungarian Championships and a fifth-place finish in the European Championships. He later coached three seasons with Budapest's BSE Club (1996 to 1999) and then established the Nrk-Nyregyhaza Club, developing a team that became middle Europe's top women's volleyball club. Forman's teams claimed both the Hungarian Championship and the Hungarian Cup three years running (2000, 2001 and 2002). Prior to beginning his coaching career Forman played volleyball 10 years with the U. Dozsa Sport Club (1978 to 1983) and the Hungarian University of Physical Education team (1984 to 1988). He is married to the former Agnes Hargitai of Budapest, Hungary, and they have two sons ??‚Äù Peter, 12, and Adam, 9."
