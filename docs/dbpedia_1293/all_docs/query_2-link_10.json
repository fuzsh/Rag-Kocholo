This year 14 formats from all around Europe will be presented during the session. As every year, we will end the day by awarding the 3 best formats, voted by the audience.\n\nEBU Formats Pitch (29 September 2023, 09:30 - 12:30 CET)\n\n7 new projects will be presented with potential for co-development or co-productions. Producers and/or commissioners will pitch to potential partners in co-development and/or co-production of factual entertainment and/or studio projects. Don't miss this opportunity to have a first-hand pick at tomorrow's next best format.\n\nTake a look at the list of formats that the EBU Formats Experts Group selected to be presented during the event.\n\nThe event will take place at the EBU Headquarters in Geneva, Switzerland. A hybrid option to join the event online will be offered for Members who cannot join the event in person.\n\nThere is no fee to join the event either in person or online, or to submit programmes.\n\nThe three best formats of 2023 have finally been revealed, congrats to:"
