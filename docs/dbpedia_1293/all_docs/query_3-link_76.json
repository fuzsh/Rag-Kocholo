        "text": "I got to contribute to an interesting discussion in the Norwegian media today about Lamine Yamal (16) who is already being labeled as a superstar.\n\nhttps://www.nrk.no/fotballem/slar-alarm-om-em-juvelen_-_-en-tikkende_-psykologisk-bombe-1.16957237\n\nIn this blog post I intend to develop the points that I discussed.\n\n“Jusqu’ici, tout va bien” –“Mais l’important, c’est pas la chute. C’est l’atterrissage” (“So far, so good”- “It’s not how you fall that matters. It’s how you land”)\n\nLamine Yamal set a record as the youngest player to appear in the UEFA European championship. Millions of young kids have possibly found a new hero. Perhaps they will try and replicate his skills when they play on a football pitch, while he becomes their new star on Xbox and PlayStation. In contrast, the previous record holder Kacper Kozlowski’s, who made his UEFA European championship debut with Poland at 17, is now 21 and out on loan to his 7th club and hasn’t played for Poland since 2021.\n\nThere is no doubt that Yamal has brought a lot of excitement to what is otherwise a very average tournament characterized by heavily fatigued players. I have written about how UEFA and FIFA entrenched in a neoliberal ideology of efficiency, growth and competition, are arguably squeezing the last few drops out of their globalised lemon, while degrading the welfare of players (1). Yamal could well be, if not already is, the poster boy for the ‘future market’ that is driving a system towards monotising the commercialisation and premature professionalisation (the race to the bottom) of youth football players. Indeed, following in Lionel Messi’s footsteps, Yamal dropped Nike as his boot supplier in February 2024 to sign a long-term deal with Adidas. The irony here is that that Yamal may not have risen so quickly to this ‘superstar’ status if Barcelona did not have such strict financial regulations imposed on them due to their failures in the ‘market’.\n\nAll this makes me think of another Barcelona teenage sensation Bojan Krkic who broke every goal scoring record in Barcelona’s academy and made his first team debut at 17 years and 19 days. Suddenly he was a vulnerable boy thrown into a man’s world, and he found the change overwhelming. Just like Yamal is now, Bojan was hailed as the new Messi. He later opened up about how such huge expectations brought on overwhelming anxiety attacks, that no one wants to talk about in football. He still lives with the scars and with people saying that his career hasn’t been as expected.\n\nThe recent article in Norwegian newspaper VG (2) provided some good insights into the biggest dangers with a 16-year-old being placed in the football world’s spotlight at such a young age. The examples provided of Fati, Pedri and Gavi and the already extended periods they have spent out injured at such a young age highlights this.\n\nAnsu Fati (21). Barca debut as a 16-year-old, national team debut the following year. Has had 12 interruptions with injury and been out for a total of 590 days.\n\nPedri (21). Debut in Barcelona as a 17-year-old and in the national team as an 18-year-old. 68 games for club and national team in his first Barca season. Has had nine different injuries, mostly hamstring and muscular and has been out of action for 435 days .\n\nGavi (19). Made his debut for Barcelona and Spain right after he turned 17. Played 111 games, 89 from the start, before rupturing his cruciate ligament in the EC qualifier against Georgia last autumn. Been out with an injury for a total of 282 days .\n\nYamal’s body is not fully developed. It is still growing, and the research is very clear that the risk is high for injuries during growth periods. Sean Cumming, a researcher on growth and maturation in sport at the University of Bath, spoke to me about some recent research into injuries in soccer players (3): “Certain apophyseal sites (where the tendon attaches to the bone) in the pelvis are not fully fused until up to 25 years, so technically growth can take quite a period of time.”\n\nIt requires energy to play football, and it requires energy for the body to grow. The danger is that it can be like burning a candle at both ends. It can burn out very quickly, physically and mentally. This coupled with status, social expectations and various external pressures that have been recalibrating our socio-cultural values and now being imposed on child-youth and senior football (1) (4), is potentially a psychological ticking time bomb.\n\nIt is hard for us to discuss if Spain could have done something different, when it comes to Yamal, as we have very little insight into what is happening behind the scenes. However, like Bojan Krkic, the pressure of living up to early expectations and the damaging way people see you through the media are current and future challenges for Lamine Yamal.\n\nWe have created the conditions for this, we have thrown him into this world, let’s be kind to him.\n\nVinz: It’s about a society on its way down. And as it falls, it keeps telling itself: “So far so good… So far so good… So far so good.” It’s not how you fall that matters. It’s how you land.\n\nReferences\n\n1. O’Sullivan, M. (2024, July 5).

You can listen here from about 40 secs: https://www.rte.ie/radio/radio1/clips/22326843/\n\nIn the following text I would like to extend on a few of the ideas that I brought up.\n\nThe choice of who will be the new Irish manager (men and women) is basically addressing the process of solving a short-term need. However, Irish football seems to be at a serious crossroads. Indeed, one could argue that Irish football has been at a serious crossroads for many years now. Financial scandals, pothole politics and more recent unfortunate administrative financial discrepancies, highlights how the FAI and Irish football have merely been dancing at the crossroads since the halcyon days of Jack Charlton, rather than dealing with the serious business of evolving Irish football. The come down has proven costly.\n\nThere is of course a lot of talk about change, the launch of a strategic plan, structures and restructuring, policies, player development pathways, coach education pathway. For me this is just administrators, now the gate keepers of the game, reinforcing, and sustaining the illusion of professionalism. Robert Pirsig’s iconic passage from ‘Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance’ comes to mind.\n\n“If a factory is torn down but the rationality which produced it is left standing, then that rationality will simply produce another factory. If a revolution destroys a government, but the systematic patterns of thought that produced that government are left intact, then those patterns will repeat themselves… There’s so much talk about the system. And so little understanding.”\n\nThe need for an understanding of culture and context within the ecosystem of Irish football has long been ignored and I would argue, its potential greatly underestimated. There is so much talk about the system and so little understanding.\n\nI have listened to the ongoing Irish football debate over the last few years. Even now when the dancing has stopped, the song remains the same and the same patterns of thought get repeated and repeated. A particular feature of these discussions has been the amount of reductionist cause-effect arguments- other countries or clubs do X and they get Y, we need to do the same (a common feature of discussions in other countries). I recently listened to an Irish podcast where an eminent ‘football man’ argued that we need to get the best 8-year old’s together in academies to teach them the game. I discussed this with a friend of mine from Dublin who now lives in Stockholm. He said, “welcome to Dublin schoolboys soccer for the last 30 years”.\n\nWhat is really been referred to here is what has become known as the Standard Model of Talent Development (SMTD) (Bailey & Collins, 2013). Essentially, basing identification on early ability or physiological and/or anthropometrical measures; and the removal of athletes from the system as they progress from one level to the next. Described as a ‘pyramid’ structure dependent on strong coordinated central governance, this model lacks both empirical and conceptual validity (Bjørndal et al., 2016). Indeed, Ford and colleagues (2020) revealed an ongoing difficulty in identifying young players and keeping them in the system, while revealing the systems inherent difficulty in coping with inherent fluctuations in performance and development. In 29 of the best professional soccer clubs from around the world, they highlighted a relatively high annual turnover of players, around 29%, through age groups. Many models based on this ‘pyramid’ shape clearly fail to account for the complexity and nonlinearity of human development (Vaughan et al., 2019; Bailey & Collins, 2013), fundamentally highlighting inherent problems related to the prediction of the future (Finnegan, 2020).\n\nFar too many talent development discussions in Irish football are being driven by anecdotal stories based on survivorship bias within these ‘pyramid’ systems. Select some eggs early, put the eggs in a bag, throw the bag against the wall, take out the egg that doesn’t break- The system works! Make this system the only game in town and it becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy. Well, talent is the graveyard of evidence, nobody sees the dead bodies.\n\nThe process of talent development is complex, dynamic and characterised by uncertainty and unpredictability in relation to future outcomes (Phillips et al., 2010). In European youth football, this complexity has been compounded by some recent developments. For example, alchemic pursuit of identifying and developing young ‘talent’ has gained intensity since the “Bernard case” in 2010. Essentially a follow up to the 1995 Bosman ruling. The European Court of Justice ruled that football clubs can seek compensation, if young players they trained signed their first professional contract with a team in another EU country. Youth football could now be framed as an economic activity, thus encouraging the training of young ’talented’ players as a form of human capital investment (Hendrickx, 2010).\n\nThe process of talent development is complex, and for every complex problem there’s a solution presented that is simple (other countries do X and they get Y so we should do it), neat (administrative strategy document, generic player development pathway), and more than often problematic. It’s the illusion of professionalism. There’s so much talk about the system. And so little understanding.\n\nThere is no copy -paste template\n\nIt is well documented that the FAI, until recently, have been implementing a so-called Dutch model to underpin its player development plan. Referring to my earlier point highlighting a need to understand culture and context within the ecosystem of Irish football, this showed a lack of appreciation for the idea that player development does not take place within a socio-cultural and historical vacuum. Indeed, any player development plan proposed by a national sports governing body that doesn’t take into consideration the specific culture and context, is essentially just a typical generic copy-paste development plan. In a 2015 UEFA study of the top seven football nations North and colleagues (2015) warned against this superficial approach, the uncritical application of practice ideas from other successful countries and clubs. My colleagues and I have carried out research highlighting the risks associated with ignoring the diverse and deeply rooted nature of socio-cultural constraints that shape how the game may be played from locale to locale (O’Sullivan et al., 2021; 2023a; 2023b; 2023c).\n\nThis message was central to a podcast discussion I had with the Dutch FA and the Canadian Soccer Association in May 2020 -If you try and copy and paste someone else’s ideas, it just won’t work!\n\nThe problem is, when you copy a Dutch model or a Dutch way (e.g.,Ajax) in to another country, it will not work. Our infrastructure is so unique for example. – Jan Verbeek (KNVB)\n\nSo, what about the divide between Ireland and other countries on the continent when it comes to player development? This has been another central point of discussion. My research has recently turned up a new twist in the copy-paste template phenomena that I think believe offers Ireland (and other countries) great hope. There is a worrying trend – an emerging, and accelerating, homogenisation of football and coach education through a globalised methodology across football cultures, regardless of context (O’Sullivan et al., 2023c). A sort of ‘methodological imperialism’. In his insightful Qatar World Cup analysis in the Athletic, long time Guardiola mentor and now his assistant coach, Juanma Lillo (2022) referred to the homogenisation of the game, with everyone using the same methods and tactics. Interestingly, Argentina was the exception, returning to ‘la nuestra’ (our game, our values), arguably rebelling against the globalisation and homogenisation of ‘trending’ tactical modes. But that’s another story.\n\nLillo also argued that irrespective of context, a training session in Norway and one in South Africa (for example) would likely be the same, perhaps characterised by ‘two touchism’. As a self-confessed exponent of many of these ideas that have been copy and pasted freely around the world, Lillo reflected on his own contribution to this homogenisation, stating: “if there was one person I would really want to question now, it would be me from 25 years ago”.\n\nI believe that it is somewhere within this homogenisation and globalisation of the game that Irish football now finds itself, lost without an identity, and if the ongoing player development debate is too be believed, still seeking copy-paste solutions from other more successful nations, while been blinded by unicorns and survivors and misled by economic forces. There’s so much talk about the system. And so little understanding.\n\nSo how does this offer Ireland great hope? I have long argued in my research work, that player development frameworks should evolve in interaction with the socio-cultural context in which people are embedded. There is no copy-paste template. The incredible unique culture and context that the ecosystem of Irish football is embedded in, offers so many opportunities for the development of Irish football. Opportunities unique to Ireland alone. For example, Hurling, Gaelic football, rugby, and basketball, provide the potential for a broad movement and skill landscape that can complement and enrich the movement and skills of young developing Irish footballers. Of course, the important point here is, don’t deny kids the opportunity to play other sports and don’t force them play other sports. Provide opportunities and make it affordable. Make coach education affordable. In fact, make it free, especially at the grassroots level. I completed my UEFA A license in Sweden over 10 years ago. I didn’t pay for one course on the way. Value education and place a high value on having highly educated coach educators, this is crucial.\n\nOf course, the SFAI (Schoolboys/girls Football Association of Ireland), the governing body for under-age football in the Republic of Ireland have a major role to play in this. Do the various governing bodies, and I am talking about at the level of administration, want to be system limiters by governing through self-interest or system enablers through placing children at the centre? Football is for children, not the other way around.\n\nThe debate into the development of Irish football needs to move from prioritising the administrative box ticking needs of structure, policy and strategy, towards a more pedagogical, philosophical, and socio-cultural discussion/ investigation, one that places young players and their learning IN development at the centre of the discussion. Only then s can we develop structures and strategies to support the evolution of a player development framework within this unique socio-cultural context. There is no copy-paste template.\n\nThere’s so much talk about the system. And so little understanding.\n\nPodcast: I was lucky to be invited on to the excellent Mike Quirke podcast series.

Once again, arguements displaying a varying level of “infomed” opinion have contributed to a polarised debate. A particular feature of this most recent debate was the amount of reductionist cause-effect arguments. Other countries or clubs do X and they get Y, we need to do the same. If it was only that simple! Further, a basic understanding of math should make it clear that decisons made in recent years (changes in coach education, removing the publication of results and tables before 13 years) have nothing to do with the results of the national team.\n\nAnother misguided argument is that we need more individual/isolated training with the younger players. From a Stockholm perspective, I doubt that there is any other country in Europe that has dedicated more time to individual and isolated training in practice and coach education (until 2014) than Sweden has over the last 25 years. Believe me, I have attended these courses!\n\nThis idea of more and more individualised/isolated training is a ’sticky’ culturally resilient belief that contributes to an inertia in Swedish youth football. It seems to partly have its roots in the false idea that it takes 10,000 hours of practice to become an expert. Indeed, SvFF have themselves contributed to this idea. A UEFA Pro course (highest UEFA coach qualification) held by the Swedish FA (SvFF) in Gothenburg in May 2011, claimed:\n\nBecoming a good player has nothing to do with talent, it’s just about training. Everything is possible to influence through training except its length. There is a more or less accepted belief in the so-called “10-year rule” which states that to become an expert in an area requires a minimum of 10 years of training (Tipselit, 2011).\n\nThe message promoted here is associated with Malcolm Gladwell’s (2008) ‘popular’ misinterpretation of Ericsson and colleagues’ (1993) work on deliberate practice. The incredible momentum of this idea of the 10,000-hour rule, generated in Gladwell’s (2008) book, may go some way to explaining why many clubs, parents and coaches have bought in to the unnecessary generalisation that development of expertise has all to do with accumulated volume of practice (Seifert et al. 2018).\n\nThese generalized ideas are further confounded by a cultural -histiorical inheritance that has had a cascading influence on the type of practices promoted and appreciated in Swedish youth football (as highlighted in the recent debate). This can be traced back to the 1970s, when the pedagogical legitimacy of SvFF’s ‘Swedish model’ (based on the West German model) was being questioned by the successful sporting results and the seemingly more professional nature projected by the ‘English model’ (introduced to Sweden by professional coaches Bob Houghton and Roy Hodgson). The English model promoted a ‘teacher-centered’ pedagogy, where the coach had the overall picture of how the game should be organised and the players needed to comply, internalising the systematised knowledge that the coach promoted (Peterson,1993). This coach-imposed approach drew parallels with behaviourist (neglecting the players agency in thelearning process) (Lyle & Cushion, 2017) and information processing theories (Fitts & Posner, 1967; Schmidt,1975), that have underpinned traditional ‘drill/skill’ approaches (North et al., 2015). This was exemplified in the intricacies of the ‘technical register’ (coaching folder and video archive of 31 films11), that dominated coach education in Swedish football until 2014.\n\nThese type of practices promoted placed an emphasis on instructions and corrective feedback for reproducing forms of movement or predetermined patterns of play.The ‘technique register’ was sold as a ‘gold-standard textbook’ of ideal movements, promoting a reliance on external agency (i.e., high levels of instruction and feedback) in coach education, and a reductionist and mechanistic attitude towards practice and performance. Developed within and across generations, this perspective shaped beliefs, and expectations about coaching and how practice in child youth football should look.\n\nAgainst this cultural-historical tide, the Swedish FA have in recent years done some serious reflection; and utilising a more evidence-based approach to human learning in development have attempted (it is still ongoing) to implement major changes in the area of coach education. In a recent article in Swedish national newspaper Dagens Nyheter, SvFF Technical Director Perra Widén and his colleague Claes Eriksson (head of development U21 national team), made a valuable contribution to this debate that deserves some analysis.\n\nHere Perra highlights a major recent change in coach education:\n\n– We are moving from a top-down steered leadership (coach centered) to a more involved leadership (player-environment centered)-to help players learn to make decisions themselves.\n\nThis is a welcome move towards a more ‘modern’ pedagogy that has the intention of shaking off some rather sticky culturally resilient beliefs and attitudes. For example, the idea of the young player being central to the learning process (not the coach) is something that will require a lot of education and patience, if the recent debate is anything to go by. The coach centered technical register, based on fake fundamentals and a one size fits all approach, has thankfully been shelved. Maybe another blog is needed to highlight how ideas promoted in the technical register may contribute to an excessive number of injuries in young players, having a possible negative effect on well-being.\n\nOn analysing the interview with Perra Widén and his colleague Claes Eriksson, a much deeper and more important message, in line with much of the current research into youth player development, is illuminated. Sweden is NOT Germany, Italy or Holland. We can even break it down, Swedish clubs are NOT Ajax, Barcelona or Liverpool. Context is key! To further highlight this point, North et al (2015) in their UEFA study of 7 top football nations warned against the uncritical application of practice ideas from other successful countries and clubs. It was argued that an approach which works in one socio-cultural context may be DISTRACTING or even DETRIMENTAL in another.\n\nThis message was central to a podcast discussion I had with the Dutch FA and the Canadian Soccer Association in May 2020 -If you try and copy and paste someone else’s ideas, it just won’t work!\n\nThe problem is, when you copy a Dutch model or a Dutch way (e.g.,Ajax) in to another country, it will not work. Our infrastructure is so unique for example. – Jan Verbeek (KNVB)\n\nJason DeVos, who has revamped coach education in Canada and is assistant coach with the Canadian national team that qualified for their first World Cup since 1986, added:\n\nIf I had a dollar for every person that told me that you just need to copy what Germany does, Belgium does, what Iceland does, then I would be able to retire right now – Jason DeVos (Canadian Soccer Association)\n\nYou can find a link to the pod here: https://footblogball.wordpress.com/2020/05/04/different-cultures-similar-issues/\n\nIn summary, player development frameworks should evolve in, interaction with the socio-cultural context in which individuals are embedded- THERE IS NO COPY and PASTE TEMPLATE! (O’Sullivan et al., 2021)\n\nFor a practical example of how to move from a top-down steered leadership (coach centered) to a more involved leadership (player-environment centered)-to help players learn to make decisions themselves.(Sullivan et al., 2021), and place the player at the center of the learning process, please check this link:\n\nhttps://threadreaderapp.com/thread/1581245601659772930.html\n\nSome music\n\nhttps://themightyquark.bandcamp.com/album/the-mighty-quark-presents-the-king-syndrome-sound\n\nReferences\n\nEricsson, K.

The paper, published August 2021, introduces the framework that James Vaughan and I have been using to carry out research at AIK youth football since 2017. More recently, English Premier League club Southampton FC have adopted the research framework (more on this later).\n\nThe article is open access and can be found here:\n\nThe importance of understanding how we become skillful is very important for sports organizations, especially in the realm of athlete development and for enhancing expertise (Clarke, 1995; Ribeiro et al., 2021). It has been recognized that a sports organization is part of a complex, multi-layered system, where the social, cultural, and historical contexts in which development occurs, are important constraints on the development and understanding of skilled performance (Bjørndal & Ronglan, 2019). However, traditional research approaches tend to neglect many of these critical features (e.g., sociocultural constraints) that have important implications for transferring findings to applied settings (e.g., coaching, talent development) (Araújo et al., 2007). Indeed, it was highlighted in a previous blog (see here), how specific unique social, cultural and historical factors, invite the potential for a myriad of possible complex, unpredictable and ill-defined challenges. We need to find ways to highlight and harness these factors (O’Sullivan et al., 2021; Vaughan et al., 2019).\n\nIn response, some colleagues and I proposed the Learning in Development Research Framework (LDRF), as a powerful theoretical and methodological framework to exemplify a move towards understanding human (athlete) action in the very contexts that behaviour occurs (Brunswik, 1955). The LDRF adopts an ecological perspective that simultaneously places an emphasis on both the individual and environment and their reciprocal interactions (Araújo et al., 2017). Consistent with this perspective, learning is understood to occur in the midst of ongoing developmental changes (Adolph, 2019), within speci!c socioecological contexts (Flôres et al., 2019), influenced by numerous contextualized, reciprocal interactions between people and places (Bronfenbrenner & Morris, 2006; Vaughan et al., 2019). More directly, the LDRF offers as a novel way of guiding research and action, supporting the notion that athlete development frameworks should evolve in interaction with the sociocultural context in which individuals are embedded.\n\nIn the paper we provided a case study where we connected the (inter)actions of young players and the intentions of coaches to the sociocultural and historical context. Further, we highlighted how we utilized these findings to devise interventions to probe the system (e.g., amplify and dampen helpful and unhelpful factors that shape learning in development)\n\nThe following paragraph is an example of some of the findings from the first research phase that informed the first action phase (interventions/probes) at the club.\n\nA coach centered “control over context” pedagogical inheritance\n\nIt was identified that coaching skill was being shaped by a landscape of traditional coach edu- cation practices, founded upon specific sociocultural and historical constraints. For instance, training designs in Swedish coach education have historically been underpinned by a culturally dominant planning paradigm, arguably promoting the assumption that human behavior can be predicted and controlled (e.g. coach determines in advance the specific theme, presents predetermined coaching points and controls the sequence and duration for each part of the session). Global-to-local processes were amplified in a coaching culture that attempted to control future outcomes. The actions of young players were routinely ‘drilled’ in choreographed practices where predetermined passing patterns were performed to be later regurgitated in competitive games. Indeed, these practices promoted in coach education highlighted a cultural-historical inheritance. This can be traced back to the 1970s, when the pedagogical legitimacy of the Swedish Football Association’s ‘Swedish model’ (based on West German football) was being questioned by the successful sporting results and the seemingly more professional nature projected by the ‘English model’ (introduced to Sweden by Bob Houghton and Roy Hodgson). This model promoted a ‘teacher-centered’ pedagogy, where the coach had the overall picture of how the game should be organized and the players needed to internalize the systematized knowledge that the coach pro- moted (Eliasson, 2003; Peterson, 1993). Subsequently, Sven Göran Eriksson successfully adopted the English model, developing it into the ‘Swenglish model’ which became the accepted model of prac- tice for the SvFF (Peterson, 1993).\n\nWe hope that this paper can support sports organizations, coaches, practitioners in becoming more aware of the extent to which different and unique sociocultural and historical constraints continuously shape their work. There is no copy and paste template, athlete development frameworks should evolve in, interaction with the sociocultural context in which individuals are embedded.\n\nEarworm!!!\n\nReferences\n\nAdolph, K.

Talent Development in Sport Requires Athlete Enrichment: Contemporary Insights from a Nonlinear Pedagogy and the Athletic Skills Model. Sports Medicine, 51, 1115 – 1122.\n\nÅr 2015 släppte Internationella olympiska kommittén (IOK) en rapport som väckte oro över de senaste trenderna inom ungdomsidrott. Uttalandet ifrågasatte giltigheten av traditionella talangutvecklingsmodeller inom ungdomsidrott, samtidigt som det hänvisade till problematiken med tidig specialisering, föräldrapress, coachstilar, mediesensationalism och synen på ungdomar som handelsvaror (Bergeron et al, 2015). Fortsättningsvis rekommenderade IOK att ramverken för ungdomsutveckling inom idrott måste vara mer flexibla, med en kombination av både bästa träning och erfarenhet som stöds av kvalitetsuppdaterad forskning.\n\nSökandet efter den alkemiska processen för hur man identifierar och utvecklar professionella idrottare/spelare har beskrivits som den ”heliga gralen” för alla idrottsnationer (Weissenteiner, 2017). Miljöer inom fotboll som framgångsrikt utvecklar profesionella spelare kan avnjuta en ökad finansiell vinst och erkännande. (Henriksen, 2011). Detta sökandet har blivit mer intensiv sedan “Bernard -fallet” 2010, en uppföljning av Bosman -domen från 1995. EU -domstolen beslutade att fotbollsklubbar kan söka ersättning, om unga spelare de har tränat tecknade sitt första proffskontrakt med ett lag i ett annat EU -land. Ungdomsfotboll kunde nu beskrivas som en ekonomisk aktivitet och därmed uppmuntra till utbildningen av unga ”talangfulla” spelare som en form av investering i humankapital (Hendrickx, 2010). Detta har utan tvekan påskyndat ett “talent arm race” och resulterat i en trend att importera och reproducera talangutvecklingsmodeller från “framgångsrika” nationer eller klubbar, samtidigt som det delvis gav kontexten för att ytterligare legitimera och motivera den genomgripande användningen av det som har blivit allmänt känt som ’The Standard Model of Talent Development’ (SMTD).\n\nSMTD (Bailey & Collins, 2013) delar gemensamma egenskaper som nu är centrala principer för talangvecklingsprogram runt om i världen (Güllich, 2014; Rongen et al., 2018). Till exempel, basera identifiering på tidig förmåga eller fysiologiska och/eller antropometriska mätningar; samt uteslutande av spelare från systemet när de går från en nivå (åldersgrupp) till en annan (Bjørndal et al., 2017). Denna pyramid-liknande struktur som är beroende av en stark samordnad central stryrning, saknar både empirisk och konceptuell validitet. (Bjørndal et al., 2017).\n\nTrots dessa insikter är strukturerade spelarutvecklingsmodeller världen runt relativt homogena och vanliga, med många klubbar och organisationer som satsar stort på professionalisering av identifiering och utveckling av talanger (Ford et al., 2012, Williams et al., 2020). Forskning av Ford och kollegor (2020) i 29 av de bäst rankade professionella fotbollsklubbarna från hela världen belyste en relativt hög årlig omsättning av spelare, cirka 29%, genom alla åldersgrupper. Detta visade en pågående svårighet att identifiera unga spelare och behålla dem i systemet, samtidigt som de avslöjade systemens medföljande svårigheter att hantera variationer i prestation och utveckling som är naturligt förekommande aspekter av livet och lärandet inom sport (Adolph, 2019; Balagué et al. , 2017; Button et al., 2020;). Många modeller baserade på denna ‘pyramidform’ misslyckas med att ta hänsyn till komplexiteten och det icke linjära i mänsklig utveckling (Vaughan et al., 2019; Bailey & Collins, 2013), vilket i grunden belyser medföljande problem relaterade till framtida förutsägelser (Finnegan, 2020).\n\nForskning har belyst dessa medfödda problem relaterade till det förutsägande värdet av framtida prestation genom tidig identifiering (Williams & Reilly, 2000; Bailey & Collins, 2013; Koz, Fraser-Thomas och Baker, 2012). Exempelvis visade studier i Sverige (Lund & Söderström, 2017) och Nederländerna (Bergkamp et al., 2021) hur tränarnas och scouternas talangidentifiering stöds av ett ”intuitivt” tillvägagångssätt (det som känns rätt!). Men det som känns rätt påverkas starkt av deras erfarenhet av tidigare identifieringar, personliga tolkningar av vad elitfotboll innebär och den tränarkultur som de befinner sig i. Dessutom menades att scouter var medvetna om att tidiga prestationsindikatorer ofta är dåliga förutsägare för framtida prestanda.\n\nDessa subjektiva metoder har kritiserats på grund av det gynnar valet av spelare födda tidigare under (ålderskategori år) (Glamser & Vincent 2004; Helsen et al., 2005), ett fenomen som har kallats Relative Age Effect (RAE). I ungdomsfotboll har det visats hur RAE är mer uttalat i urval för akademin än inom ’grassroots footboll’ (Jackson & Comber, 2020). Förekomsten av RAE inom spelarsutvecklingssystem har förklarats av flera faktorer, såsom mognad, födelsedatum, miljöfaktorer, socioekonomisk klass (Teolda da Costa et al., 2010). Mognadsskillnaderna mellan individer har varit den vanligaste hypotesen. Till exempel, inom ett års åldersspann bland ungdomsfotboll kommer det att finnas en matchning av kronologiska åldrar men inte nödvändigtvis biologiska åldrar (Finnegan, 2020). Kronologiska och biologiska åldrar utvecklas sällan samtidigt i samma takt, vilket antyder att variationen sannolikt kommer att vara större än 12-månader i en åldersgrupp (Vaeyens et al., 2008; Helsen et al., 2005). Eftersom tidigare mognad kan påverka utvecklingen av flera antropometriska och fysiologiska variabler som påverkar valet av “äldre” spelare (Finnegan, 2020), finns det medföljande problem med ramar där varje steg är associerat med en kronologisk ålder. Det har hävdats att barn/ungdomar som missgynnas av födelsedatum eller fysisk mognad kunde blivit lika skickliga senioridrottare om de fick likvärdiga utvecklingsmöjligheter (Doyle & Bottomley, 2018). Trots påståenden från vissa styrande organ, så jämnar RAE inte ut sig i slutändan och ledande europeiska fotbollsklubbar fortsätter att rekrytera fler och fler tidigt födda spelare (Carling et al., 2009; Doyle & Bottomley, 2018).\n\nDessutom, en avgörande betydelse är hur ofta dessa modeller legitimeras och motiveras genom en ’copy & paste’ talangutvecklingsmall importerade från “framgångsrika” nationer eller klubbar. North och kollegor (2015) varnade i sin UEFA -studie, som undersökte utveckling av spelare och coachning i ungdomsfotboll i sju europeiska länder, mot den okritiska tillämpningen av idéer från andra framgångsrika länder och klubbar. Här hävdades att ett tillvägagångssätt som fungerar i ett sociokulturellt sammanhang kan vara distraherande eller till och med skadligt i ett annat.\n\nDet finns tydlig anledning att tvivla på om dessa modeller av talangutveckling (SMTD) och organisation i många elitidrottsstrukturer har tillräcklig vetenskaplig validitet. Det finns ännu mer anledning att ifrågasätta med det okritiska ”copy and paste” av bästa praxis från framgångsrika länder eller klubbar. Även kravet på kontakttid (Finnegan, 2020), där styrande organ använder jämförelser med andra nationer angående antalet timmar som spenderas i träningar ledda av coacher, är ett mycket begränsat perspektiv av utvecklingen när vi överväger komplexiteten i utvecklingen av talanger inom sport (Güllich, 2014; Suppiah et al., 2015; Vaughan et al., 2019). Dessa meddelanden, som förmodligen är förknippade med den falskt främjade uppfattningen om 10 000 -timmarsregeln, kan på något sätt förklara varför många klubbar, föräldrar och tränare har köpt in sig på den onödiga generalisering som utveckling av expertis har att göra med ackumulerad volym av träning. (Seifert et al. 2019). Det är faktiskt ”illusionen av vetenskaplig trovärdighet och validitet” (skapad av idrottspolitiska beslutsfattare) som ger vissa tvivelaktiga idéer en viss auktoritet inom talangutvecklingsmiljö (Bailey & Collins, 2013, Bjørndal et al., 2017).\n\nFör att bättre förstå utveckling i och genom idrott spelar kultur och kontext en stor roll (Araújo et al., 2010; Vaughan et al., 2021; O’Sullivan et al., 2021). Kanske det är dags att undersöka ett sätt att förstå de olika kontextuella komplexiteterna i kulturer, samhällen och situationer för att stödja ett bredare perspektiv på utveckling av spelare/idrottare.\n\nFörslag på hur vi går vidare: Skriv din egen historia?\n\nIdrottsutvecklingsmiljöer, inom ett specifikt land eller en viss klubb, är inte en tomt blad utan socialt, historiskt och kulturellt inflytande (O ’Sullivan et al., 2021; Vaughan et al., 2021). Snarare påverkar sociala och kulturella faktorer kontinuerligt en spelares/idrottares utvecklingsresa. Araujos (2010) arbete med brasiliansk fotboll belyste hur olika typer av tidig specialisering kan existera i olika kulturella sammanhang. I motsats till traditionell praxis från andra sammanhang (t.ex. tidig upprepning av rörelseövningar i strukturerade coach-centrerad träning) utvecklades ett bredare utbud av tidig specialisering, med lite formell coachning, där spelare från tidig ålder specialiserade sig på olika ”bollaktiviteter ‟ (pelada, strandfotboll osv) , som har en direkt överensstämmelse med organiserad fotboll (Côté et al., 2007).\n\nDe typer av övningsdesign som utformas, individer som identifieras som talangfulla och karaktärsdrag som utmärker en bra coach, formas kontinuerligt av sociokulturella faktorer (Redelius, 2013; O ’Sullivan et al., 2021). Denna idé belyser i vilken utsträckning lärande och utveckling är inbäddade i ett större sociokulturellt sammanhang. Dessa specifika unika, sociala, kulturella och historiska faktorer inbjuder till potential för många möjliga komplexa, oförutsägbara och illa definierade utmaningar. (Bjørndal et al., 2019; Vaughan et al., 2019). Det kan därför föreslås att spelarutvecklingskontext (klubb, träning, tävling) kan inte ensam redogöra för sina invånares beteende (Rothwell et al., 2020). Om det var det, kunde vi faktiskt bara ”copy & paste” en lånad mall!!!\n\nInom idrott, liksom andra prestandamiljöer, betyder sammanhang allt. Vi måste skriva vår egen historia! Det som är möjligt i Barcelona eller Amsterdam kanske inte är möjligt eller behövs i Stockholm, Peking eller Dublin. Implikationen är att det inte finns någon ”copy & paste” -mall, spelarutvecklingsmodeller bör utvecklas i interaktion med det specifika sociokulturella sammanhang där individer är inbäddade (Vaughan et al., 2019; O ‘Sullivan et al., 2021). Eftersom det också är uppskattat att inlärning är en icke linjär process-vilket innebär att coachningsmetoder inom idrott ska vara tillmötesgående-är det rimligt att föreslå att idrottsutvecklingsstrukturer och modeller också ska ta hänsyn till denna icke linjärhet. (Sullivan et al 2021).\n\nSom specifika unika, sociala, kulturella och historiska faktorer, bjuda in potentialen för en myriad av möjliga komplexa, oförutsägbara och illa definierade utmaningar, måste vi hitta sätt att lyfta fram och utnyttja dessa faktorer (O’Sullivan et al., 2021; Vaughan et al., 2019). Styrande organisationer och klubbar bör utmana sig själva att anta strategier för att vägleda pålitliga sätt att bedriva forskning och utforma praktiska tillämpningar för att stödja utvecklingen av flexibla ramar inom sin egen ekologi, specifikt för deras sociokulturella sammanhang.\n\nReferenser:\n\nAdolph, K.

Sports Med – Open 6, 36.\n\nDon’t be blinded by unicorns and survivors and misled by economic forces – Ross Tucker\n\nIn 2015, the International Olympic Committee released a consensus statement raising concerns regarding recent trends in youth athlete development. The statement questioned the validity of talent development models in youth sport, while also referring to the problematic nature of early specialisation, parental pressure, coaching styles, media sensationalism, and the view of youth athletes as commodities (Bergeron et al, 2015). Further, the IOC consensus statement recommended that frameworks for youth development need to be more flexible, incorporating a combination of both best practice and experience underpinned by quality up to date research.\n\nThe search and pursuit of the alchemic process of how to unearth and develop professional athletes has been described as the’holy grail’ of any sporting nation (Weissenteiner, 2017). In football, environments that successfully develop professional players can enjoy both increased profits and recognition (Henriksen, 2011). This pursuit has gained intensity since the “Bernard case” in 2010, a follow up to the Bosman ruling. The European Court of Justice ruled that football clubs can seek compensation, if young players they trained signed their first professional contract with a team in another EU country. Youth football could now be framed as an economic activity, thus encouraging the training of young ’talented’ players as a form of human capital investment (Hendrickx, 2010). This has arguably accelerated a ’talent arms race’, resulting in incentives to import and reproduce talent development models from ‘successful’ nations or clubs, while partly providing the context to further legitamise and justify the pervasive use of what has become broadly known as the Standard Model of Talent Development (SMTD).\n\nCoined by Bailey and Collins (2013), the SMTD shares common characteristics that are now central tenets of player development programs around the world (Güllich, 2014; Rongen et al., 2018). For example, basing identification on early ability or physiological and/or anthropometrical measures; and the removal of athletes from the system as they progress from one level to the next (Bjørndal et al., 2017). Described as a ‘pyramid’ structure dependent on strong coordinated central governance, this model lacks both empirical and conceptual validity (Bjørndal et al., 2017).\n\nDespite these insights, structured performance pathways across countries are relatively homogenous and commonplace, with many clubs and organisations investing heavily into the professionalisation of the identification and development of talent (Ford et al., 2012, Williams et al., 2020). More recent work carried out by Ford and colleagues (2020) in 29 of the best professional soccer clubs from around the world, highlighted a relatively high annual turnover of players, around 29%, through age groups. This showed an ongoing difficulty in identifying young players and keeping them in the system, while revealing the systems inherent difficulty in coping with fluctuations in performance and development that are naturally occurring aspects of life and learning in sport (Adolph, 2019; Balagué et al., 2017; Button et al., 2020;). Many models based on this ‘pyramid’ shape clearly fail to account for the complexity and nonlinearity of human development (Vaughan et al., 2019; Bailey & Collins, 2013), fundamentally highlighting inherent problems related to the prediction of the future (Finnegan, 2020).\n\nResearch has highlighted these inherent problems related to the predictive value of future performance through early identification (Williams & Reilly, 2000; Bailey & Collins, 2013; Koz, Fraser-Thomas, & Baker, 2012). For instance, studies in Sweden (Lund & Söderström, 2017) and the Netherlands (Bergkamp et al., 2021) showed how coaches’ talent identification is underpinned by an ‘intuitive’ approach (what feels right!). But what feels right is greatly influenced by their experience of previous identifications, personal interpretations of what elite football entails, and the coaching culture in which they find themselves. It was further suggested that scouts were aware that early indicators of performance are often poor predictors of future performance.\n\nThese subjective methods have been criticised due to a bias towards the selection of players born earlier in the (age category year) (Glamser & Vincent 2004; Helsen et al., 2005), a phenomenon that has been referred to as the Relative Age Effect (RAE). In youth football it has been shown how RAE is more pronounced in selection to the academy than in grassroots football (Jackson & Comber, 2020). The presence of RAE within athlete development systems has been explained by several factors, such as, maturation, date of birth, environmental factors, socioeconomic class (Teolda da Costa et al., 2010). The maturational differences between individuals has been the most common hypothesis. For example, within a one-year age bracket in youth football, there will be a match of chronological ages but not necessarily biological ages (Finnegan, 2020). Chronological and biological ages rarely progress concurrently to the same degree, implying the variance is likely to be greater than the 12-month age band (Vaeyens et al., 2008; Helsen et al., 2005). As earlier maturation can affect the development of several anthropometric and physiological variables biasing the selection of ‘older’ players (Finnegan, 2020), there are inherent problems with frameworks where each stage is associated with a chronological age. It has been argued that children disadvantaged by birth date or physical maturity might have become equally skilled senior athletes if they were afforded equivalent developmental opportunities (Doyle & Bottomley, 2018). Despite claims from some governing bodies, reversals of the RAE rarely exist in a true sense (see here). Yet leading European football clubs continue to recruit more and more early born players (Carling et al., 2009; Doyle & Bottomley, 2018).\n\nAlso, of critical importance is how often these models are legitimised and justified through a ‘copy and paste’ template of talent development models imported from ‘successful’ nations or clubs. North and colleagues (2015), in their UEFA study, investigating player development and coaching in youth football in seven European countries, warned against the uncritical application of good practice ideas from other successful countries and clubs. Here it was argued that an approach which works in one sociocultural context may be distracting or even detrimental in another.\n\nThere is clear reason to doubt whether these models of talent development and organisation in many elite sporting structures have sufficient scientific validity. There is even further reason to reinforce issues associated with the uncritical “copy and paste” of best practice from successful countries or clubs. Even the clamour for contact time (Finnegan, 2020), where Governing Bodies use comparisons with other nations regarding the number of hours spent in coach led training, is a very narrow lens through which to view development when we consider the complexities involved in developing talent in sport (Güllich, 2014; Suppiah et al., 2015; Vaughan et al., 2019). These messages, arguably associated with the falsely promoted notion of the 10, 000 hour rule, may go some way to explaining why many clubs, parents and coaches have bought in to the unnecessary generalisation that development of expertise has all to do with accumulated volume of practice (Seifert et al. 2019). Indeed, it is ‘the illusion of scientific credibility and validity (created by sports policy makers) that provides a degree of authority to some dubious ideas’ evident in talent development structures (Bailey & Collins, 2013, Bjørndal et al., 2017).\n\nTo better understand player/athlete development in and through sport, culture and context do matter (Araújo et al., 2010; Vaughan et al., 2021; O’Sullivan et al., 2021). Perhaps it is time to investigate ways to comprehend the distinct contextual complexities of cultures, communities and situations to support a broader perspective on player/athlete development.\n\nSuggestions for moving forward: Write your own story?\n\nAthlete development environments, within a specific country or club, are not blank slates devoid of social, historical and cultural influence (O’ Sullivan et al., 2021; Vaughan et al., 2021). Rather, social and cultural factors continually shape an athlete’s development journey. Araujo’s (2010) work on Brazilian football highlighted how different kinds of early specialisation can exist in different cultural contexts. In contrast with traditional practices from other contexts (e.g., early deliberate practice, precise repetition of movement drills in structured practice tasks), a broader range of early specialisation was developed, with little formal coaching, where players from an early age specialised in “feet-ball activities‟, that have a direct correspondence to organized football (Côté et al., 2007).\n\nThe types of practice designed, which individuals are identified as talented and the characteristics that distinguish a good coach, are continually shaped by sociocultural factors (Redelius, 2013; O’ Sullivan et al., 2021). This idea highlights the extent to which learning, and skill development are embedded in a larger sociocultural context. These specific unique social, cultural and historical factors, invite the potential for a myriad of possible complex, unpredictable and ill-defined challenges. (Bjørndal et al., 2019; Vaughan et al., 2019). It can therefore be suggested that the athlete development setting (club, training, competition) alone cannot account for the behaviour of its inhabitants (Rothwell et al., 2020). Indeed, if it was, we could just ‘copy and paste’ a borrowed template.\n\nIn sports, like other performance environments, context means everything. We need to write our own story! What is possible in Barcelona or Amsterdam might not be possible, or needed, in Stockholm, Beijing or Dublin. The implication is that there is no ‘copy and paste’ template, athlete development frameworks should evolve in interaction with the specific sociocultural context in which practitioners and individuals are embedded (Vaughan et al., 2019; O’ Sullivan et al., 2021). Also, as it is be appreciated that learning is a non-linear process – implying that coaching methodologies in sport should be accommodative – it is reasonable to suggest that athlete development structures and models should also account for this non-linearity (Sullivan et al 2021).\n\nAs specific unique social, cultural and historical factors, invite the potential for a myriad of possible complex, unpredictable and ill-defined challenges, we need to find ways to highlight and harness these factors (O’Sullivan et al., 2021; Vaughan et al., 2019). Governing bodies, clubs and organisations should challenge themselves to adopt strategies to guide reliable ways of conducting research and designing practical applications to support the evolution of athlete development frameworks within their own ecology, specific to their sociocultural context.\n\nIn a recent discussion with my friend and colleague Michael Cooke at Northern Ireland Sport, he asked two questions that are of relevance to this piece.\n\nWhat opportunities does your culture/ context afford that could support the healthy development and performance of young people as they grow?\n\nWhat are the unique aspects of your sport/ country/ culture that transcend the ‘copy and paste’ culture\n\nMany thanks to Michael Cooke and Andrew Kirkland for being critical friends during the process of writing this piece\n\nOn a separate note: I have re-launched my record label.

Sports Med – Open 6, 36.\n\nIt’s time for better questions: Living up to the idea of as many as possible, as long as good as good as possible\n\nThere is an ongoing discussion within youth football around the subject of ability grouping. The practice of early selection and de-selection of children through ages and stages are now central tenets of player development programs around the world (Güllich, 2014; Rongen et al., 2018) and have become a common point of departure for these discussions. Often pyramid like in structure, these type of development programs have been termed by Bailey and Collins (2013) as the Standard Model of Talent Development. Lacking in both empirical and conceptual validity this model is based on the presumption that development and performance in sport are conceptually linear and predictable (Bjørndal, Ronglan & Andersen, 2017).\n\nLanguage precedes culture\n\nMore recently these models have come under media scrutiny (Shannon, 17 November 2020) highlighting how there are many social norms and organisational pressures present within the facets of professional football that impinge on child youth football. For example, the use of words such as ‘elite’ in reference to children and youth has added to the development of a sensationalist artificial mythology in and around the culture of child youth sports programs (Kirkland, O’Sullivan, 2018).\n\nSimilar concerns were raised by the International Olympic Committee in a consensus statement on youth athlete development in 2015, highlighting possible negative influences on health and well-being. It was suggested that the ‘culture’ of youth sports in general, has become disproportionately both adult and media centered, viewing youth athletes as commodities promoting a sensationalism that has an influential grip on adult expectations (Bergeron et al., 2015).\n\nIndeed, language plays an important role as does acknowledging that learning and development cannot be fully understood without taking in to consideration the environmental, historical, and socio- cultural constraints that can influence learning and development. For example, many resilient beliefs and even the attributes and skills appreciated in young players are culturally embedded in traditional pedagogical approaches, organisational settings and structural mechanisms founded upon specific socio-cultural and historical constraints (Woods et al, 2020). There is a need to investigate which specific sociocultural constraints on behaviours that we need to amplify and which ones we need to dampen (Vaughan et al., 2019)?\n\nIn Sweden, the well-worn cliché “lika barn leka bäst” (children that are alike play best together) is something that I hear regularly in connection with ability grouping in child-youth sport. This for me highlights an important aspect of any youth player development program, how performance can be an unreliable index in relation to learning (Söderstrom & Bjork, 2015).\n\nThe debate here though less polarized is still at time driven by anecdotal evidence with certain individuals referring to the players that ‘they’ have created!\n\nHere, the idea of survivorship bias is something that is worth reflecting over\n\n“You’ve been blinded by the unicorns and survivors, and misled by economic forces” – Ross Tucker (twitter)\n\nTime for better questions- The learner and the learning process\n\nFor a more nuanced approach and in order to place the child/youth/player at the center of this discussion from a long-term learning perspective, we need to turn the question around.\n\nWhen I am asked about ability grouping/selection-deselection (yes or no?), I now answer with another question.\n\nWhat is your understanding of the learner and the learning process?\n\nWhat is your understanding of human learning and development in a youth football context?\n\nRe-conceptualising youth development\n\nAIK Youth Football, took the decision in 2017 to reposition itself within the world of youth football (see here). This decision was underpinned by a long-term strategy; (i) promote the wellbeing of children; (ii) follow relevant guideline documents (e.g. UN Convention on the Rights of the Child); (iii) increase the development and promotion of players to our respective senior teams, as well as increase the number of players in the U16-U19 age groups.\n\nA research and development (R&D) department has been embedded in the club’s daily activities since 2017 to support AIK youth football in its endeavor. Its stance and work can be summed up as follows –\n\nWhile it is understood that human learning is nonlinear in nature, implying that coaching methodologies should account for such nonlinearity, it should also be recognized that there is a need for our player development structures and models to account for this nonlinearity\n\nIf we really want to support the well-being and foster more and better players, then it is important to consider the complexity and non-linearity of human development. This requires an understanding of what learning and development is and what factors that can influence it?\n\nLearning IN Development\n\nThe concept of Learning in development (Adolph, 2019) can help coaches, parents and organisations understand how different factors influence learning throughout development, helping us to gain an understanding of the non-linear and individualized nature of players learning in development.\n\nDevelopment describes the continuous changes (physical, psychological, skilled, social, cultural) in individual-environmental relationships.\n\nLearning takes place in the midst of these developmental changes. Learning is what the player does about these changes.\n\nAs coaches, parents, clubs and governing bodies, we need to find a balance in our between both supporting and challenging young players during their learning IN development.\n\nWhat specific soicocultural constraints on behaviours do we need to amplify and what do we need to dampen?\n\nThe aim with this piece is to stimulate a broad and informed debate within youth sport by emphasising the complexity and non-linearity of human development and the need to understand the dynamic interrelations between various components, if we are to truly live up to the idea of ‘as many as possible, as long as possible, as good as possible’\n\nPerhaps it’s time for better questions?\n\nReferences\n\nAdolph, K.
