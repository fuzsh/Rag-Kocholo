        "text": "In winter, much of Norway transforms into a snow-clad paradise. That provides ideal opportunities for exciting activities in the snowy landscape, and our love for snow is deep. Skiing plays a key role in Norwegian culture and history. During winter, people of all ages head to ski resorts, forests, and mountains to enjoy powdery snow, excellent slopes, and groomed cross-country trails.\n\nYou can also do many fun activities without skis, like tobogganing, snowshoeing, dog sledging, fatbiking and whale watching. Or maybe you want to go for a tranquil fjord cruise, where you can enjoy the view of snow-capped mountains reflected in the water?\n\nWinter is also a great time to experience some of the world’s most beautiful train journeys, without the crowds. In November and December, you can visit charming Christmas markets all around the country.\n\nThe northern lights\n\nWinter nights are long throughout Norway. From the middle of November until the end of January, the sun doesn’t rise at all, or just briefly peaks out over the horizon, in most parts of Northern Norway. However, it is far from pitch dark all the time, and the snow lightens the landscape in a very poetic way. On clear days, especially in the southern part of this region, you might experience several hours of daylight and some beautiful sunset colours, while the sky to the north is a deep midnight blue. In Bodø and Lofoten, the sun only remains completely below the horizon for about a month.\n\nIf you're lucky, the northern lights might dance above your head! They are most commonly seen in the north, but can on rare occasions be spotted throughout Norway. October to March are the best months to try to catch this magical light show.\n\nIn southern Norway, you can expect between six and eight hours of daylight during the winter months.\n\nBook your northern lights adventure with Hurtigruten or see more northern lights holiday offers.\n\nHow to dress for winter weather\n\nIn Norway, some winters are very cold and some are mild. Dressing for outdoor activities depends on what you are doing and where you are doing it.\n\nDress warmly and in layers. Use wool rather than cotton or polyester as an inner layer, and make sure you can protect yourself from getting wet and being caught in the wind. A wind and waterproof jacket will come in handy as you might experience rain. If you are not going to be very active, a thick down jacket and snow pants combined with thermal underwear will keep you nice and warm.\n\nSeasonal food and drink\n\nFresh seafood is at its best in the winter. The end of January also marks the start of the skrei season, when the Arctic cod migrates from the Barents Sea to the warmer waters around Lofoten and Vesterålen to spawn.\n\nDishes based on fish, mutton, pork, or deer are popular Christmas foods and can be found at many restaurants in the run-up to the holiday season. If you are feeling adventurous, you should sample some traditional Norwegian dishes like smalahove (sheep’s head, it's true, honest), lutefisk (cod soaked in lye) and pinnekjøtt (dried, salted and steamed sheep ribs). Don't worry though, supermarkets are well-stocked with a variety of international foods, and you can find delicious restaurants for every taste."
