By portraying a realistic, yet exciting story, each season shows the challenges multicultural teens meet in Norway today.\n\nSeason four, entitled 19, tells the story about 19-year-old Aisha, who dreams about being a strong and independent woman, but lives in a world in which being one proves to be challenging.\n\nOriginal title: 17 / 18 / 16 / 19\n\nDuration: 17/18/16/19 x 7-20 minutes (4 seasons)\n\nGenre: Teen drama\n\nProduced by: NRK\n\nCreated/written by: Marte Sunde Harter, Melike Leblebicioglu Kaveh and Ane Arstad Isungset\n\nDirected by: Bendik Stalheim Møller\n\nDistributor: Primitives\n\nStatus: Aired in 2018, 2019, 2020 and 2021\n\nExecutive producer NRK: Andreas Øyvåg\n\n1814\n\nDanish King Frederik has made a huge mistake. He allied himself with Napoleon. The Swedish king Karl Johan is now at the door with his army demanding Norway as a reward for Sweden’s efforts against the French. The British attacked Copenhagen, stole the entire Danish-Norwegian fleet, and now blocks all trade in and out of Norway.\n\nNorway is hit by a deadly famine, and a Norwegian mother named Vigen is desperate as her daughter Anna is emaciated with hunger. She embarks on an impossible journey. In a small rowboat, she rows from Norway to Denmark to buy grain. After 6 days on the open sea, she is spotted by a British cruiser. Only a hundred yards from shore, the rowboat and the grain are lowered, and Vigen is taken prisoner.\n\nThis is the series about Christian Frederik’s secret plan to keep Norway under Denmark, Swedish Karl Johan’s conquest plans, and Vigen’s struggle to get from an English prison back to her family.\n\nOriginal title: Vigen\n\nDuration: 6 – 8 x 55 minutes\n\nGenre: Historical Drama\n\nProduced by: The Global Ensemble Drama\n\nCreated/written by: Odd Magnus Williamson\n\nDirected by: TBA\n\nDistributor: TBA\n\nExecutive producer NRK: Alec Thom\n\nA Better Man\n\nTom (45) is a smart, but angry and frustrated man with misogynistic tendencies who discovers that the world opens up to him when he dresses in women’s clothes.\n\nHe transitions from a despicable caterpillar into an outrageous trans-butterfly, and eventually blossoms into a decent man over the course of the series.\n\n«A Better Man» is as entertaining as it is relevant in its storytelling and themes. The show addresses issues such as online harassment, gender roles, and cancel culture, but most of all it presents a surprising path from hatred and isolation to intimacy and reconciliation.\n\nSynopsis:\n\nTom’s day job is running his mother’s clothing store, but by night he has been trolling the internet for years. His favourite hate objects are feminists in general and the famous stand-up comedian Heidi Steensvaag (33) in particular. To Tom, Heidi is the manifestation of what he calls the “vaginal state of Norway.”\n\nOne of Tom´s seething hate-comments causes Heidi to break down on stage one night. She shares his comment in public, prompting enraged hackers to expose Tom’s true identity. He is ridiculed, mocked, and threatened. In a desperate bid to go underground, he shaves his beard, and hides in what he has close at hand: clothing for middle-aged women. Scared, homeless and devoid of his online world, he experiences compassion and warmth from strangers.\n\nHeidi, on the other hand, becomes obsessed with Tom when the police suggest he may have committed suicide. She feels responsible, and almost like she’s the only person mourning his death.\n\nWhile Tom discovers the world as Brenda, his neighbour, Audun, is caught in a surreal dilemma that strikes Audun as unbearable, being a modern man and father of young children. Alongside Tom and Heidi, Audun contributes to exploring various aspects of gender roles, identity, and sexuality.\n\n★ Selected for N12\n\nOriginal title: Ølhunden Berit\n\nDuration: 4 x 45min\n\nGenre: Drama\n\nProduced by: Maipo Film on behalf of NRK\n\nCreated /Written by: Thomas Seeberg Torjussen\n\nDirected by: Thomas Seeberg Torjussen and TBC\n\nDistributor: Beta Film\n\nStatus: In production.

In 2020, 30 years later, the reporter reopens the story. On his way to uncover who Agnes Waade really was and why she ran away, he meets with relatives, friends, fellow villagers, health workers, bureaucrats and others, who start painting a different picture of her.

Audun Rikardsen still has the urge to take pictures that no one has ever seen the likes of. And he wins awards all over the world. In this programme, we join him in his work with the photographs. We get to see his creative solutions which result in spectacular encounters with whales, sea eagles – and a bride and groom face a crazy challenge.\n\nIn order to make a good photograph, you have to be playful and pursue your interests. This will provide you with knowledge about the motif, and enable you to be at the right spot at the right time, Audun tells us.\n\nIn his boyhood he loved to go fishing in small rivers, build nesting boxes, and go hiking with his parents. He retained his interest in nature, and today he is a professor of biology at The Arctic University of Norway in Tromsø. He is a grown man, but every time he gets a new idea for a photo, he is like a kid stealing apples. Full of energy, with sparkling eyes, and with an eternally optimistic faith in his project.\n\nThe motifs of his pictures are often found right outside his entrance door. In the programme, he swims with killer whales, and gets so close to them that he has to call out for help. He attaches a camera to the back of a whale, causing it to film its own journey through the waters. He also installs a camera inside a cod’s belly, with the intention of luring the sea eagle to fly with the cod in its claws – thereby filming itself in the air.\n\nAudun sets goals for himself that are extremely technically ambitious, and which also involve wild animals. He is never sure he will succeed, but he has a strong will and great endurance.\n\nThe last few years he has specialized in photos taken right in the middle of the ocean’s surface, thereby showing what’s going on above as well as below the surface. – I was ten years old when I got my first diving mask. Since then, I have always been fascinated by the tiny millimetre dividing two entirely different worlds, Audun relates in the programme.\n\nSeveral people have been fascinated by Audun’s so-called split photographs. Last year he won the Wildlife Photographer of the Year competition with a photo series. The award was presented to him at the Natural History Museum in London. Among all the prizes Audun has won, this was the most distinguished one. – It’s like winning the nature photographers’ Oscar. And I have of course submitted photos for this year’s competition as well, Audun informs us.\n\nOriginal title: Et eventyr gjennom linsa\n\nDuration: 52 minutes\n\nGenre: Documentary / nature\n\nProduced by: NRK\n\nWritten/Directed by: Helge Bones\n\nDistributor: TBA\n\nStatus: Aired in 2016\n\nExecutive Producer NRK: Tone Lein\n\nA New Kind of Wilderness\n\nOn a small farm in the Norwegian forest, the Payne family seeks a wild and free existence. Maria and Nik, together with their four children, embrace self-sufficiency, home-schooling and want to live an independent family life in harmony with nature. To make ends meet, Maria occasionally works as a photographer. She also captures her family, sharing their life on her blog, wildandfree.\n\nHowever, their idyllic world upends when tragedy strikes. Maria dies after a short period of illness, and it forces them to forge a new path into modern society. Nik is forced to sell the farm, and reluctantly, he and his children need to change their isolated and natural lifestyle and be a part of the modern society. They move from the farm; Nik needs to find a job and reluctantly he must enroll the children into the school system. The three youngest ones stay with Nik, while their half-sister Ronja, moves to live with her dad in the city.\n\nFifteen-year-old Ronja desperately tries to reconnect with her siblings, while ten-year-old Freja becomes the family’s rock, caring for her younger brothers and father.\n\nThroughout the film Marias’s photos and stories keeps her memory alive and connects her to the family.\n\nIn A NEW KIND OF WILDERNESS, filmmaker Silje Evensmo Jacobsen captures an intimate and soulful portrait of love, life, and growing up. The Payne’s’ journey, their triumphs, and struggles, invite reflection on our own life choices, our responsibility to the planet and our children, and how we navigate life after loss.\n\n★Winner The World Cinema Grand Jury Prize at Sundance 2024.\n\n★Winner Grand jury prize SIFF 2024 documentary competition.\n\n★Winner Special mention Zagrebdox 2024\n\n★Winner DOK.fest Munchen, SOS-Kinderdörfer weltweit (SOS children villages)\n\n★Nominee Golden Alexander International competition, Thessaloniki film festival 2024\n\nScreened at several well acclaimed festivals all over the world.\n\nOriginal title: Ukjent landskap\n\nDuration: 83 minutes\n\nGenre: Documentary (family, sustainability, environmental)\n\nProduced by: A5 Film on behalf of NRK\n\nCreated/Written by: Silje Evensmo Jacobsen\n\nDirected by: Silje Evensmo Jacobsen\n\nDistributor: DR Sales\n\nStatus: Aires in 2024\n\nExecutive producer NRK: Anne Kvadsheim\n\nBeast\n\nSixteen-year-old Elias is one of the best players on one of Norway’s best youth football teams.

How far is he willing to go to achieve this goal in a sport that is based on being a good team player?\n\nIn Beast we meet a group of young talented boys at a point in their life where anything can happen. They are still playing football for fun, but the dream of being discovered is suddenly within reach.\n\nWhat is it like to combine professional sports with life as a teenager? What do you have to sacrifice to reach the top?

In three instructive episodes we get to see how students stop bullying at their school.\n\nLisa is miserable because other kids exclude her from their game. She’s not the only one who feels this way. Many children experience bad things at school and feel unsafe. If children are not feeling well, adults should help and not give up until the pain stops and everyone is fine.\n\nAnton dreads going to school almost every morning because he is locked out of the game. «Nobody can help me», thinks Anton. But there is someone who can help.\n\nRati feels invisible in her class because no one listens when she tells her story; no one answers when she asks a question. Fortunately, there is someone who can help.\n\nThis TV-series is based on recent international studies on bullying and group dynamics. Conflict is a part of everyday life, as such, so is conflict resolution. Children are often confronted with problems large and small. “Classmates” provides help for these common scenarios.\n\n★ Chicago International children’s film festival (USA)\n\n★ Los Angeles International children’s film festival (USA)\n\n★ Stuttgart international festival of animated film (Tyskland)\n\n★ Ahmedabad international (India)\n\n★ International Children’s rights Film Festival (Tyrkia)\n\nOriginal title: Klassevenner\n\nDuration: 3 x 13 minutes\n\nGenre: Children drama & facts / Infotainment\n\nProduced by: Bivrost Film as on behalf of NRK\n\nCreated by: Bivrost Film as\n\nWritten by: Marianne Müller & Stine Kühle-Hansen\n\nDirected by: Trond Jacobsen & Marianne Müller\n\nDistributor: TBA\n\nStatus: 1st season aired 2020. 2nd season in development.\n\nExecutive producer NRK: Siril Heyerdahl\n\nFar From the City, Close to a Dream\n\nHave you ever dreamt of living close to nature under simple conditions? “Far From the city, Close To A Dream” you meet people who do just that.\n\nIn season after season, this series has captivated Norwegian TV audience. 22 years after the first episode was shown on NRK, the program series still has a large audience, both linear and online.\n\nIn the series, you get to meet a wide range of people – young and old, singles, couples and family people – who face various dilemmas in life. What they have in common is that they have chosen to live in remote places, often close to nature and under simpler conditions, such as on a mountain shelf, a windswept island out in the sea or far out in the wilderness with the polar bear lurking around the house.\n\nAlthough everyday life in these empty spaces can appear exotic and different, we as TV audience recognize ourselves in the people who live there. In each episode we get close to the main characters, and you can mirror your own life in the ups and downs they experience.\n\nWe are fascinated by the difficult life they have chosen, and we are impressed by how they overcome the challenges that everyday life presents, often in an original and inventive way. We are struck by how magnificent and wonderful the nature and scenery around them is, and we often feel drawn there ourselves.\n\nThe series is considered a national treasure, it says something about who Norwegians are, and who Norwegians were, as a people.\n\nOriginal title: Der ingen skulle tru at nokon kunne bu\n\nDuration: 9 seasons: 8 seasons 6 x 40min and 1 season 7 x 40min\n\nGenre: Documentary\n\nProduced by: NRK\n\nCreated by: Oddgeir Bruaset\n\nWritten by: From 2015: Arve Uglum, Noralv Pedersen\n\nDirected by: Noralv Pedersen and Torje Bjellaas\n\nDistributor: TBA\n\nStatus: 10th cleared season in production\n\nExecutive Producer NRK: Kristin Ytre-Arne\n\nJens and Isak on Thin Ice\n\nThe two recent friends Jens Kvernmo and Isak Dreyer dream of living like an Inuit and embark on an adventurous voyage into the wilderness of Greenland.

The place music is performed becomes the stage.\n\nThe story around why the concert is taking place on the specific location, combined with three or four songs performed in a dramaturgic curve, small talk in between, and some important key information, gives the audience the opportunity to get to know artists just a little bit more, maybe a little personal – and maybe get to know new artists.\n\nHopefully the audience will listen to their music in another, more focused way. And maybe it will give more depth to music exploration in general. The variety in every program, comes naturally with new artists in new places: outside a cabin, at a school, on a beach, in the woods – all places with a tiny or big “because”.

What first seems like yet another routine mission for a UN medical platoon quickly changes to a life-altering event for the young man and his squad. In a city bombed to pieces, they find a hospital that looks ready to collapse. And a basement filled with hundreds of patients.\n\nOver a number of highly dramatic days, the medical platoon saves around 300 patients via air, all while being surrounded by forces that are attacking the city. This is the story of a remarkable real-life event and of a young man being forced to make decisions in situations way beyond what could reasonably be expected of him. It’s a story about friendship and courage but also about luck and bad decisions. And about the paradox of trying to impose peace without becoming a warrior.\n\nOriginal title: Det er ikke krig\n\nDuration: 8 x 60 minutes\n\nGenre: Drama\n\nProduced by: Fenomen\n\nCreated /Written by: Linn Jeanethe Kyed\n\nDirected by: Daniel Fahre\n\nDistributor: TBA\n\nStatus: In development\n\nExecutive producer NRK: Alec Thom\n\nRumors\n\nWhat happens when your biggest secret reaches those around you? Will everyone turn on you, or will someone dare to take your side? Rumors is a youth series about friendship and bullying during the final year of middle school. When Erik is assaulted by his friends, he and his mother choose to move from Bergen to a small island outside the city. He gets to know the popular kids, and they take an interest in him.

The island’s influencer creates false hate profiles about Erik on social media, and he is back to where it all began, being bullied and becoming a victim of false rumors.\n\nIn the second season of «Rumors» the youth of Vesterøy start college. Some have always lived on the small island, others just moved here, but all of them see this as an opportunity to redefine themselves. It just isn’t easy to find out who you are or maybe even hope to be in this small and intricate social hierarchy situated on the rural and rugged Norwegian coast.\n\nTake for instance the perfect hunk trying to win back his ol’ boys. He says that nothing has changed, allthough he has developed feelings for one of them and might even be a homosexual. Or the lying influencer who fled when her secrets were revealed. She tries to come back a new and better person, but no matter what she says everyone deems her actions as fake.\n\nAnd then there’s the bad boy showing off his temper and aggression to hide the problems at home – and the newcomer from the capital who hopes to show the backward coastal society that things must change. That women should stir up old male arenas like the fishing industry.\n\nThey all do their best to create a new identity for the college years to come, but you can only define so much on your own – in the end it’s the rumors that decide who you really are.\n\nOriginal title: Rykter\n\nDuration: 30/30 x 10 minutes.

The drama in the story arises when reality turns out not quite to match the dream.\n\nThe underlying theme of the series is about settling for what one has rather than always striving for something more.

Stripped across 8 episodes, family friendly holiday event series.\n\n10 celebrities and one host have been invited to a remote resort in the snow bound Norwegian mountains. On arrival they all learn they’ve been summoned by an celebrity obsessed murderer. Trapped on the mountain they must play the murderer’s sick holiday themed games. Games in the form of Easter, Thanksgiving or any other holiday related competitions. The loser of each competition gets killed in an overly theatric way, often in a nod to a film or murder mystery we’re all familiar with. The host is forced to facilitate each competition. We also learn that the mysterious murderer is a well-known celebrity, and hints to reveal his/her identity will be dropped through the episodes, as the celebs must unmask them before they are all bumped off.\n\nCompetitions are originally based on traditional Norwegian Easter vacation activities, such as skiing, ice swimming, Easter egg hunt and much more. The competitions are funny and challenging but always based on holiday traditions.\n\nOver 8 episodes 10 celebrities compete in 1 new fun filled competition in each episode. That episode’s loser will meet an unfortunate end. The next episode starts with the celebrity playing dead in their own extravagant crime scene as the host and remaining contestants are presented with the new murder to solve.\n\nIn the last episode the remaining three contestants compete to solve the murderer’s identity. This is a national play along murder mystery. The murderer is a household name, and the celebs and audience will speculate through the episodes and especially during the finale. Hints have been placed throughout the series. In crime scenes, in the hotel, during competitions etc. Last celebrity standing only gets to leave the mountain after unmasking the murderer. Easter, from Palm Sunday until Easter Sunday, the audience gets a delicious murder / mystery / whodunnit / competition driven reality packed with elements of humor and feelgood television.\n\nOriginal title: Påskekrimlekene\n\nDuration: 8 x 15-20 minutes\n\nGenre: Competitive reality with a hint of murder mystery\n\nProduced by: : Magga & Anders on behalf of NRK\n\nCreated/written by: Marcus Hukkelås og Magnus Liestøl\n\nDirected by: Marcus Sand Hukkelås, Anders Bremnes\n\nDistributor: Lineup\n\nStatus: Aired in 2024\n\nExecutive Producer NRK: Jan Egil Ådland"
