        "text": "You know how people often talk about bringing/experimenting with/regulating AI in the newsroom and kind of forget what the end goal is? We are very happy to launch this new special series that focuses on journalism rather than algorithms. The first story looks at how Norsk rikskringkasting (NRK) saw audiences doubling their reading time since it started adding automated summaries to its articles. More practical, down-to-earth stories told by journalists to follow. https://lnkd.in/ehpJBhCH\n\nThis is a really interesting article on AI in journalism. While I totally understand the time and cost saving advantages, there are negatives too such as impacting Google search traffic and taking away the need to build relationships out in the local community, let alone eroding the public's trust in news articles. I'm inclined to agree that any AI written piece needs to be clearly marked as such, even if some of them appear obvious (eg; photo captions of people as 'plate of egg and beans'!). https://lnkd.in/e-bXx8jS\n\nYes, part of the work in newsrooms may be substituted by AI like Google's effort, see the story. But hello, AI cannot generate relevant news in very small towns, like in Hanko, where I have myself piloted hyperlocal news media. Why am I saying no job for AI ? - Just because not that much happens over here! There simply are no news 'seeds' available for AI to read in digital form. Here is the point: news stories need to be generated, by digging in, interviewing various people, authorities, enterprices, event organisers, even taxi drivers who do know what is topical in our 'village'. Summary: human touch is needed in hyperlocal news! A call for innovation still left: business model? https://lnkd.in/eEvXENxi\n\n\"Nearly three-quarters (72%) of us would prefer to read content written by a human\". Yes, but are we willing to pay for humans to write it? This will be massive challenge (and temptation) for any news publisher as AI advances continue to develop to help reduce costs and find ways to generate audiences/revenue streams. We have premium ad free versions, will there be premium 'written by humans not AI' versions to come? https://lnkd.in/ezifrTKK\n\nIf you have noticed the new Google AI summaries at the top of your search results ðŸ‘¨ðŸ’» , you should probably read this Vanity Fair article and think about their message. AI is sweeping through everything that is digital and while I enjoy reading news articles on my #ipad compared with a printed newspaper, I still enjoy reading news articles, not a summary that is likely incorrect, generated by some AI. If you feel this way too, click on actual articles and consider supporting your favorite news agency with a monthly subscription. https://lnkd.in/gsVC9vyC\n\nNow that we're officially in the \"grey slime\" era of AI-generated content, what can journalists do about it? This might be a controversial take, but how about embracing it? No, I don't mean actually supporting the kinds of things that Kate Knibbs has been reporting at Wired â€” harvesting domains like the Hairpin and turning them into content farms â€” but accepting that generative AI is part of our content ecosystem now, and the choice is going to become use it for good or for evil, not use it or don't use it. John Biggs has a lot more to say about this in today's edition of The Media Copilot. #ai #aicontent #greyslime\n\nThe rise of AI-powered newsbots poses both opportunities and challenges for the media industry. On one hand, algorithms can churn out high volumes of raw, commoditized news content on topics like weather, traffic, sports scores, etc. This threatens to disrupt traditional media outlets that rely on human reporters to cover hyperlocal news beats. However, as newsbots take over basic reporting, there will be an increasing premium placed on insightful, investigative journalism and thoughtful commentary produced by human writers. While robots can spit out the facts, people still yearn for storytelling, analysis and opinions that only humans can provide. Therefore, as AI proliferates, legacy media brands would be wise to double down on their core competitive advantage - insightful perspectives, investigative pieces and compelling narratives that engage audiences on a deeper level. There will always be an appetite for the type of thoughtful, nuanced writing that only a person can create. As technology changes how we produce and consume news, the human touch remains invaluable. #ai #genai #futurism\n\nAI Upsets News Publishers for Good: Publishers have had a challenging experience with AI in recent months, as highlighted by Microsoft's MSN uploading an AI-generated poll alongside a news article, causing backlash from readers and damage to Microsoft's reputation. MSN has gradually transitioned to using AI automation instead of human editors, resulting in the publication of false or inappropriate content. However, there are efforts to improve AI integration in journalism, with many newsrooms already utilizing AI for various tasks. While concerns about ethical implications remain, the fusion of AI and human creativity in media is an exciting development. - Artificial Intelligence topics! #ai #artificialintelligence #intelligenzaartificiale"
