        "text": "A range of games from pan-European soccer’s UEFA Women’s Champions League (UWCL) will be broadcast free-to-air (FTA) in Norway by a combination of public-service broadcaster NRK and commercial network TV2.\n\nThe broadcasters will split 15 fixtures from the main stages of the 2023-24 UWCL between them, with Norwegian side Brann involved.\n\nBrann’s first group stage match saw them secure a 2-1 victory away to St Polten on Tuesday (November 14) with that clash broadcast live by TV2.\n\nIn addition to a number of matches from the group stage, NRK and TV2 will cover two of the four quarter-finals, both semi-finals and the final on May 25.\n\nAll of Brann’s matches throughout the tournament will also be aired live on radio by NRK’s offering on that medium.\n\nEspen Olsen, sports editor at NRK, said: “This is a good day for NRK, TV2, and Norwegian soccer. Brann will compete with the best players in Europe, and it is extra great that the Norwegian people get to watch these matches on our channels. We are looking forward to following the Champions League closely.”\n\nOn December 13, NRK will broadcast Brann's match against French women’s soccer powerhouses Lyon, which will see Norway national team icon Ada Hegerberg (Lyon) taking on her sister Andrine (Brann).\n\nEarlier this week, UK broadcaster TNT Sports unveiled a major swathe of additions to its women’s soccer coverage, through a sub-licensing deal with global subscription streaming platform DAZN.\n\nAmongst other aspects to the deal, TNT Sports will show one game per match week from the group stage of the UWCL.\n\nDAZN holds UWCL rights in all countries in which it has a presence through 2023-24."
