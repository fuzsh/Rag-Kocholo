        "text": "NRK’s archives encompass a wide range of historical and topical recordings that include news, sport, entertainment, comedy, nature, the environment, science, culture and drama in addition to programmes designed for children and young people – all the work of Norway’s foremost journalists and cameramen.\n\nThe archives contain more than 100,000 hours of audio and video material, in addition to stills.\n\nArchive clips – for professional use\n\nAccess to this valuable archive material is open to other television companies, producers, production companies and advertising and multimedia agencies in Norway and abroad. We can also meet other corporate requirements for various purposes and supply audio and video material for use by museums, libraries and similar institutions.\n\nWe ourselves retrieve clips and copy them in the required format.\n\nTerms:\n\nArchive material may only be used for the specific purpose agreed upon in advance.\n\nPurchasers must themselves obtain permission for use from any other rights holders than NRK.\n\nCredit for archive clips used is to be accorded to NRK.\n\nCredit for stills used is to be accorded both to the photographer and NRK.\n\nLicence fees depend on the rights required, where the material is to be shown/territory, licence period, number of showings/transmissions etc.\n\nApplications must be submitted in writing, i.e. by E-mail to: content@nrk.no.\n\nShould further information be required before submitting an application, please phone us on +47 23 04 41 50.\n\nProgramme sales – sales of complete programmes to commercial undertakings for showing at festivals and on other TV channels\n\nIn Norway, NRK programmes may be viewed on the Corporation’s web site: tv.nrk.no.\n\nFor transmission of NRK programmmes abroad, the Corporation largely relies on external distribution companies. We sell children’s programmes, documentaries, nature programmes, drama and entertainment. For further information E-mail Bente Sagplads at bente.sagplads@nrk.no.\n\nArchive clips and complete programmes – for private use\n\nIf you wish to purchase for private use a clip from a TV or radio programme produced by NRK, please contact NRK’s Public Service:\n\nE-mail: info@nrk.no. Phone: +47 23047000.\n\nRadio programmes dating back to 1933\n\nNRK’s television archives contain material in sound and pictures spanning the years 1960 to the present day. We also have a unique collection of film clips covering the period 1905-1938. The radio archives contain programmes and features from 1933 to date.\n\nThe 75,000 hours of radio material cover everything from news, sport, entertainment, music and children’s programmes to important historical and political events, as well as a selection of sound effects.\n\nSome programme categories, among them radio theatre/plays and a variety of music and cultural series, are almost complete. Much of this material is rights-related and further sale is thus subject to prior approval.\n\nRecordings from the early years of radio broadcasting are limited in number, as in those days recording technology was in its infancy. Moreover, prior to the 1990s many recordings have been erased. Magnetic tape was expensive and for that reason priority was given to material deemed of special importance or worthy of re-use. Nowadays, all radio programmes are recorded and deposited in the Radio archives.\n\nExamples of material available from NRK archives:\n\nNRKs television archives from 1960 to date.\n\nThe complete Thor Heyerdal/Kon-Tiki archive.\n\nFilm clips 1905 – 1938.\n\nNRK’s radio archive from 1933 to the present day.\n\nContact us at content@nrk.no.\n\nAll enquiries are dealt with as quickly and efficiently as possible.\n\nArkivsalg: Informasjon på norsk"
