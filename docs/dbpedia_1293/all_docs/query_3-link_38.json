        "text": "Modern Times Group MTG AB, the international entertainment-broadcasting group, today announced that MTG A/S is launching two new sports channels in cooperation with Danish commercial broadcaster TV 2 DANMARK A/S. The new ‘TV 2 Sport’ channels will provide Danish viewers with high quality local, national and international sports entertainment and will be launched in the first half of 2007.\n\nTV 2 Sport will be available through the Viasat Pay-TV package to subscribers via Viasat’s DTH satellite platform, through IPTV, and through third party cable networks. The new channel will replace Viasat Sport 1 in Denmark and feature a mixture of Viasat and TV 2 sports content, such as soccer, tennis, cycling, boxing and motor sports and will feature up to 2,000 hours a year of live broadcasting, as well as sports editorials. The broadcasted content will be based on sports rights acquired by TV 2 Sport, as well as on the combined pool of sports rights of Viasat and TV2, which includes UEFA Champions League, the summer and winter Olympic Games and the Tour de France.\n\nThe launch of the new channel will not affect sports broadcasting on TV3+. However, the Danish premier league - ‘SAS-ligaen’, will get increased exposure through TV 2 Sport.\n\nAn additional sports channel, ‘TV 2 Sport Xtra’ will be launched alongside TV 2 Sport. The second channel will broadcast events which take place parallel to events broadcasted on TV 2 Sport and will be broadcasted in HD when that format becomes available. A new dedicated web site will be launched in Denmark to complement the new channels. ‘www.tv2sport.dk’ will feature material from both Viasat and TV 2 and will enable viewers to access a wide range of sports content.\n\nThe launch of dedicated sports channels in Denmark will complement Viasat Sport 1 in Sweden and SportN which is broadcasted in collaboration with NRK in Norway. The launch will not affect the pan-Nordic Viasat channels ‘Viasat Sport 2’ and ‘Viasat Sport 3’.\n\nTV 2 Sport will be jointly owned by Modern Times Group and TV 2 DANMARK A/S. The launch of the channel is subject to approval from Danish competition authorities.\n\nHans-Holger Albrecht, President and CEO of MTG, commented: “The launch of TV 2 Sport reflects our commitment to provide customers with the very best in sports entertainment. The new channel will offer Danish viewers an unrivalled sports experience and will make some of the best sports rights broadly available to Danish sports fans and TV viewers.”\n\n***\n\nFor further information, please visit www.mtg.se, email info@mtg.se, or contact:\n\nHans-Holger Albrecht, President & CEO\n\ntel: +46 (0) 8 562 000 50\n\nMatthew Hooper, Corporate Communications\n\ntel: +44 (0) 20 7321 5010\n\nModern Times Group is an international entertainment broadcasting group with operations in more than 30 countries around the world.
