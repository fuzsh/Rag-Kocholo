        "text": "Professor Geir Jordet, author of the new book Pressure: Lessons from the psychology of the penalty shootout (released May 2024) is described by The Times as “The World leading expert on the psychology of penalties”.\n\nGeir Jordet holds a PhD. in soccer and psychology and teaches and conducts research on psychology and elite performance at the Norwegian School of Sport Sciences. This institution is currently ranked #3 in the world on sport science research, among 300 leading sport science universities/departments.\n\nSince 2004, he has studied penalty kicks and published extensively on the topic in scientific journals. This work includes analyses of every penalty shootout in the World Cup, European Championships, and the Champions League from 1976 to today (more than 700 kicks). He has also interviewed the participants about their thoughts, emotions, and experiences with penalties in these matches.\n\nHis most extensive research interests involve performing under extreme pressure, cognitive and perceptual underpinnings of decision making, and talent development/effective learning. A principal aim in all projects is to identify the primary, psychologically related, on-pitch behaviors that drive football match performance. The general focus of his scientific work is on uncovering the psychological aspects of high performance among professional football (soccer) players and he has produced more than 50 peer review articles/book chapters on sub-topics such as visual perception, performing under pressure, effective learning, and applied psychology. He is frequently featured in major media, such as CNN, Wall Street journal, New York Times, The Times, BBC, Sky Sports, Guardian, Spiegel, El Pais, Globo, The Athletic and many others.\n\nIn addition, he is an applied performance psychology consultant working primarily with professional soccer organizations and players, and among his clients are Liverpool FC, Chelsea FC, Arsenal FC, Ajax Amsterdam FC, and Bayern Munich FC. Lately, he has also applied his methodology and expertise in North American ice hockey and basketball, collaborating with several leading NBA and NHL teams.\n\nFinally, Geir Jordet has presented for and consulted with a series of leading business organizations, such as Microsoft, Canon, Shell, PwC, Gambit Hill & Knowlton, Skagen Funds, Storebrand Asset Management, TV2, NRK (Norwegian radio and television public broadcasting company, and the largest media organization in Norway), the Norwegian Special Forces, and many others."
