Please help improve it or discuss these issues in the talk.\n\nNRK, the Norwegian Broadcasting Corporation - is the public service broadcaster in Norway.\n\nThe objective of public service broadcasting is to provide the entire population with access to a broad range of content.\n\nThe Broadcasting Act authorizes NRK to engage in broadcast activities. NRK is 97 percent financed by an individual tax that everybody in Norway has to pay.\n\nThe NRK’s public service remit is set out in the NRK placard, which is incorporated into NRK’s articles of association.\n\nThe Norwegian Broadcasting Corporation (NRK) offers the Norwegian public a wide range of content with three national TV-channels, 14 national radio-channels and the website nrk.no.\n\nServices[]\n\nTelevision channels[]\n\nNRK has organized its programs on NRK1, NRK2, and NRK3/Super to provide the public with three real options when they turn on their TVs, forming a three-channel strategy.\n\nNRK1 is Norway’s biggest channel.

The switch of all nationwide FM-stations followed up on the radio digitization mandate issued by the Storting (the Norwegian Parliament). Whereas the FM system only had space for five national channels, DAB offers around 25, and there is capacity for almost 20 more.\n\nNRK has 14 radio channels.\n\nNRK P1 is Norway’s largest radio station, both in audience figures and in broadcasting hours, with more than one million listeners each day. News, local journalism, music, current affairs, sport, traditions, and entertainment continue to be the main ingredients in the recipe that makes P1 Norway’s first choice among radio listeners. Editorial centers in Trondheim, Oslo, Bergen, and the district offices now reach a broad over-30 audience.\n\nNRK P2 is a specialist channel for culture and society, offering, amongst other things, news and debate with background and analysis throughout the day.
