However, most previous works have focused on specific research questions and included samples from male populations. As part of a larger Fédération Internationale de Football Association (FIFA) project aiming to steer women’s soccer research, our purpose with this scoping review was to give an overview of the current state of psychology-related research within women’s soccer. We searched five electronic databases up to April 2023, from which 280 original peer-reviewed articles met the inclusion criteria. Included records were inductively coded into 75 specific research topics and nine broader research categories. Population characteristics within each topic and category, and overall publication trends, were identified. The results revealed a growth in research attention, with notable increases in publication rates around the international competitions years, over the last two decades. While a notable number of abstracts did not report sufficient details about population age and/or playing levels, senior elite players were identified as the most common population studied. Most studies examined several topics from different research categories, with research focusing on emotions, moods and/or environmental factors, and the specific the topics of anxiety, stress, and coach behavior, receiving most research attention. Our study provides an informative mapping of all psychology-related research activity within women’s soccer, which will enhance researchers’ understanding of the current quantity of literature within this complex, heterogeneous, and growing area of research.\n\nShow summary\n\nBackground The association between SHA and negative mental health increases the need to understand risk factors for SHA victimization, which is important for future development of prevention programs. Objective To examine which combinations of demographic- and mental health factors were associated with subsequent SHA victimization, and the prevalence of elite athletes, recreational athletes, and reference students who experienced sexual revictimization. Participants and setting Norwegian elite athletes and recreational athletes attending sport high schools, and reference students attending non-sport high schools (mean age: 17.1 years) were eligible for participation. Methods The participants answered an online questionnaire at two measurement points one year apart, T1 and T2 (n = 1139, 51.1 % girls). After testing for measurement invariance, data were analyzed with Classification and Regression Tree analysis (CRT) using demographic- and mental health variables from T1 as independent variables, and SHA at T2 as outcome. Results The combination of being a girl with high level of symptoms of eating disorders and other psychological symptoms was associated with subsequent reporting of SHA. Among the students with lifetime experience of SHA at T1 (n = 533, 58.3 %), 49.5 % reported revictimization at T2 (60.9 % girls, 32.2 % boys, p ≤ .001). The prevalence of SHA revictimization was lower among elite athletes (44.3 %) compared with recreational athletes (49.1 %) and reference students (59.4 %, p = .019). Conclusion The combination of female gender and mental health symptoms are risk factors for subsequent SHA victimization. These findings, and the high prevalence of SHA revictimization is important knowledge for developing preventive programs targeting elite athletes, recreational athletes, and reference students.\n\nShow summary\n\nRelative Energy Deficiency in Sport (REDs) is common among female and male athletes representing various sports at different performance levels, and the underlying cause is problematic low energy availability (LEA). It is essential to prevent problematic LEA to decrease the risk of serious health and performance consequences. This narrative review addresses REDs primary, secondary and tertiary prevention strategies and recommends best practice prevention guidelines targeting the athlete health and performance team, athlete entourage (eg, coaches, parents, managers) and sport organisations. Primary prevention of REDs seeks to minimise exposure to and reduce behaviours associated with problematic LEA. Some of the important strategies are educational initiatives and de-emphasising body weight and leanness, particularly in young and subelite athletes. Secondary prevention encourages the early identification and management of REDs signs or symptoms to facilitate early treatment to prevent development of more serious REDs outcomes. Recommended strategies for identifying athletes at risk are self-reported screening instruments, individual health interviews and/or objective assessment of REDs markers. Tertiary prevention (clinical treatment) seeks to limit short-term and long-term severe health consequences of REDs. The cornerstone of tertiary prevention is identifying the source of and treating problematic LEA. Best practice guidelines to prevent REDs and related consequences include a multipronged approach targeting the athlete health and performance team, the athlete entourage and sport organisations, who all need to ensure a supportive and safe sporting environment, have sufficient REDs knowledge and remain observant for the early signs and symptoms of REDs.\n\nShow summary\n\nRelative Energy Deficiency in Sport (REDs) was first introduced in 2014 by the International Olympic Committee’s expert writing panel, identifying a syndrome of deleterious health and performance outcomes experienced by female and male athletes exposed to low energy availability (LEA; inadequate energy intake in relation to exercise energy expenditure). Since the 2018 REDs consensus, there have been >170 original research publications advancing the field of REDs science, including emerging data demonstrating the growing role of low carbohydrate availability, further evidence of the interplay between mental health and REDs and more data elucidating the impact of LEA in males. Our knowledge of REDs signs and symptoms has resulted in updated Health and Performance Conceptual Models and the development of a novel Physiological Model. This Physiological Model is designed to demonstrate the complexity of either problematic or adaptable LEA exposure, coupled with individual moderating factors, leading to changes in health and performance outcomes. Guidelines for safe and effective body composition assessment to help prevent REDs are also outlined. A new REDs Clinical Assessment Tool-Version 2 is introduced to facilitate the detection and clinical diagnosis of REDs based on accumulated severity and risk stratification, with associated training and competition recommendations. Prevention and treatment principles of REDs are presented to encourage best practices for sports organisations and clinicians. Finally, methodological best practices for REDs research are outlined to stimulate future high-quality research to address important knowledge gaps.\n\nShow summary\n\nPurpose: To examine high school students’ disclosure of sexual harassment and abuse (SHA), and awareness of reporting systems and support mechanisms in school among students, leaders, and coaches. Method: Norwegian 17-year-old high school elite athletes (n = 630), recreational athletes (n = 307), and reference students (n = 263) responded to an online questionnaire at two measurement points, 1 year apart (T1 and T2). Leaders and coaches (n = 249) at the participating high schools responded to an adapted version of the questionnaire at T1. Data were analyzed using ANOVA or Welch test, Pearson Chi-Square test, and McNemar test. Results: In total, 11.4 and 34.0% of the adolescents were aware of reporting systems and support mechanisms, respectively, in their schools. Nearly all the leaders, and half of the coaches were aware of these resources. Among the adolescents with lifetime experience of SHA, 20.1% had disclosed their experiences to someone. Girls disclosed more frequently than boys. The eliteand recreational athletes disclosed less often compared with the reference students. A negative change from T1 to T2 was found in disclosure of SHA and awareness of support mechanisms. At T2, 6.5% of the adolescents reported that their school had implemented measures against SHA during the last 12 months. Conclusion: The results emphasize a need for institutional effort to improve information about available report- and support resources and increase the relevance of use of such systems for adolescents.\n\nShow summary\n\nBackgroundPrevious research on the association between sports participation and body composition has shown mixed findings. The family home is considered one of the most influential environments on childhood obesity. Thus, the association between sports participation and body composition in children may be influenced by an obesogenic home environment.ObjectivesTo investigate if an obesogenic family environment moderates the association between sports participation and body composition in children.MethodsA total of 3999 children (54% girls; 11.6 ± 0.7 years) and their parent(s) were included from the ENERGY project. A composite obesogenic family environment risk score was created from 10 questionnaire items. Height, weight (to calculate body mass index), and waist circumference were obtained by trained researchers and used as indicators of body composition.ResultsThe composite risk score significantly moderated the association between sports participation and both waist circumference and body mass index. In children from families with moderate and high obesogenic risk, organized sports participation was significantly associated with smaller waist circumference (moderate risk: −0.29, 95% CI −0.45 to −0.14; high risk: −0.46, 95% CI −0.66 to −0.25) and lower body mass index (moderate risk: −0.10, 95% CI −0.16 to −0.04; high risk: −0.14, 95% CI −0.22 to −0.06), but not in children with a low obesogenic family risk score.ConclusionsEnrolling children in sports activities from an early age can be important for healthy weight maintenance, especially among children from obesogenic family environments.\n\nShow summary\n\nLow energy availability (LEA) occurs inadvertently and purposefully in many athletes across numerous sports; and well planned, supervised periods with moderate LEA can improve body composition and power to weight ratio possibly enhancing performance in some sports. LEA however has the potential to have negative effects on a multitude of physiological and psychological systems in female and male athletes. Systems such as the endocrine, cardiovascular, metabolism, reproductive, immune, mental perception, and motivation as well as behaviors can all be impacted by severe (serious and/or prolonged or chronic) LEA. Such widely diverse effects can influence the health status, training adaptation, and performance outcomes of athletes leading to both direct changes (e.g., decreased strength and endurance) as well as indirect changes (e.g., reduced training response, increased risk of injury) in performance. To date, performance implications have not been well examined relative to LEA. Therefore, the intent of this narrative review is to characterize the effects of short-, medium-, and long-term exposure to LEA on direct and indirect sports performance outcomes. In doing so we have focused both on laboratory settings as well as descriptive athletic case-study-type experiential evidence.\n\nShow summary\n\nFemale endurance athletes are considered a high-risk group for developing Relative Energy Deficiency in Sport (REDs). Due to the lack of educational and behavioral intervention studies, targeting and evaluating the effects of the practical daily management of REDs, we developed the Food and nUtrition for Endurance athletes—a Learning (FUEL) program, consisting of 16 weekly online lectures and individual athlete-centered nutrition counseling every other week. We recruited female endurance athletes from Norway (n = 60), Sweden (n = 84), Ireland (n = 17), and Germany (n = 47). Fifty athletes with symptoms of REDs and with low risk of eating disorders, with no use of hormonal contraceptives and no chronic diseases, were allocated to either the FUEL intervention (n = 32) (FUEL) or a 16-week control period (n = 18) (CON). All but one completed FUEL, while 15 completed CON. We found strong evidence for improvements in sports nutrition knowledge, assessed via interviews, and moderate to strong evidence in the ratings concerning self-perceived sports nutrition knowledge in FUEL versus CON. Analyses of the seven-day prospective weighed food record and questions related to sports nutrition habits, suggested weak evidence for improvements in FUEL versus CON. The FUEL intervention improved sports nutrition knowledge and suggested weak evidence for improved sports nutrition behavior in female endurance athletes with symptoms of REDs.\n\nShow summary\n\nPurpose: To examine the 12-months prevalence and 12-months prospective change in reported sexual harassment and abuse (SHA)-victimization among young elite athletes, recreational athletes, and reference students in three different social settings and identify the perpetrators. Methods: In total, 919 adolescents responded to an online questionnaire in 12th grade (T1) and 13th grade (T2). The sample consisted of elite athletes (n = 482) and recreational athletes (n = 233) attending Norwegian elite sport high schools (n = 26), and reference students (n = 200) attending ordinary high schools with no sport specialization (n = 6). Data were analyzed using Independent sample t-test, Pearson Chi-Square for independence/Fisher’s Exact test, McNemar test and logistic regression analysis. Results: The total 12-months prevalence of SHA was 38.6% at T1 and 35.1% at T2. Most of the participants (74.6-85.0%) reported no change in SHA from T1 to T2. The prevalence of SHA was higher for girls compared to boys, and elite athletes reported less SHA than recreational athletes and reference students, respectively. SHA occurred most often in a free time setting. Verbal SH, non-verbal SH, and physical SHA were reported by 24.6%, 27.0%, and 14.0%, respectively. Peers were reported as perpetrators by 83.1%, trainer/teacher/health personnel by 20.1%, and “other” perpetrators by 56.4%. Conclusions: As one in three elite athletes and nearly one in two recreational athletes and reference students, respectively, reported SHA-victimization within a 12-months period, well-targeted preventive measures are needed for both young athletes and non-athletes.\n\nShow summary\n\nBackground: Use of dietary supplements (DS) and muscle enhancing dietary supplements (MEDS) is frequent among students despite the lack of evidence of effects and health risks related to consumption. We need to increase our understanding of students’ motivation, examine potential gender differences, and explore explanatory factors, to address preventive measures related to use. Therefore, this study aimed to explore the frequency of, and the reasons for, DS use among university students, as well as explanatory factors for use of MEDS. Method: Male and female students from nine Norwegian universities participated in this cross-sectional study. Participants responded to questions about demographics, DS and MEDS use, internalization of body ideals, physical activity- and exercise level, motives for exercise, and exercise context. Independent t-test, Chi-square test, Pearson’s correlation, and logistic regression were used to investigate between group differences, associations, and explanatory factors for use, respectively. P-values ≤ 0.05 were defined as significant. Results: A total of 1001 males (34%) and females, with a mean(sd) age of 24.21(4.76) years, participated. The frequency of DS use was 42% and 40% (p = .414) in males and females, respectively, in which more males than females used DS to improve physical or mental performance (p = < .001), increase muscle mass (p = < .001) and weight for health (p = .014), and improve appearance (p = < .001). In males and females, respectively, 25% and 10% used MEDS (p = < .001). In males, being a fitness center member (OR:3.80), exercising to improve muscle mass (OR:1.96), and a higher physical activity level (OR:1.09) positively explained MEDS use, while exercising to increase endurance (OR:0.49) and being an exercise science student (OR:0.47) negatively explained MEDS use. In females, internalizing the athletic body ideal (OR:1.78) and exercising to improve muscle mass (OR:1.74) positively explained MEDS use. Conclusions: Our main findings indicate that a surprisingly high percentage of male and female Norwegian students use DS and MEDS, and that reasons for use, and variables explaining the variability in frequency of use, differ between genders. Longitudinal studies to investigate direction of associations are needed in future research.\n\nShow summary\n\nPurpose: The overall aim of the present study was to explore the experiences of older adult exercisers participating in an individualized training program lasting 3 months preparing for completing a triathlon competition. Methods: Fourteen older Norwegian adults (median age (interquartile range, IQR) for males (N=10) and females (N=4) were 70.0 (65.0-75.5) and 57.5 (56.3-62.5) years, respectively) participated in 3-month individualized training program comprising three weekly sessions of running, cycling, and swimming. Both field- and laboratory-based testing were conducted. The participants attended two sports nutrition and competitive psychology seminars focusing on triathlon competition. The participants were interviewed in depth in three different focus groups. Thematic analysis was utilized to analyze the findings. Results: Participants improved their performance in all field-based tests. After completion of the thematic data analysis the main finding and overarching theme of well-being and being fit emerged. Additionally, three main themes were identified: 1) motivation; 2) progress and coping; and 3) breaking barriers. Conclusion: Psychological well-being and satisfaction of being fit seem to be vital to participate in a triathlon competition. Promoting specific age-appropriate participation in sports activities can be an effective strategy for promoting a healthy lifestyle among the elderly. Keywords: Running; being fit; cycling; elderly; personalized training; sport participation; swimming; triathlon; well-being.\n\nShow summary\n\nObjective: To investigate the immediate and 12-months effects of a school-based intervention aiming to reduce risk and enhance protective factors for eating disorder development in high school boys and girls. Method: In total, 4,149 adolescents from 30 high schools were eligible for inclusion and 2,446 consented to participate and were randomly allocated to the Healthy Body Image (HBI) intervention or a control group (classes as usual). The HBI intervention is multicomponent consisting of three workshops targeting body image, social media usage and lifestyle. Linear mixed model and intention-to-treat analyses were applied to investigate the effects of group, time, and gender at posttest, 3-, and 12-months follow-up. The main outcome variable was weight and shape concerns, and secondary outcome variables were self-esteem, mental distress, body image flexibility, thin internalization, muscular internalization, drive for leanness, perceived media pressure, protein- and creatine supplement use, and diet aid use. Results: The HBI intervention significantly reduced eating disorder risk factor scores related to ED pathology, thin internalization and perceived pressure from media, which was particularly pronounced in girls. Positive intervention effects on body image flexibility were only observed at posttest for boys but grew increasingly larger for girls across the 12-month follow-up time span. Favorable intervention effects on protein and creatine supplement use were only present at 3-months follow-up in boys solely. A general favorable intervention effect was observed for self-esteem, mental distress, muscular internalization, and drive for leanness. Conclusion: The HBI intervention produced consistent reductions in risk factors and enhancements in protective factors associated with eating disorder development in adolescents.\n\nShow summary\n\nThe syndrome of Relative Energy Deficiency in Sport (RED-S) includes wide-ranging effects on physiological and psychological functioning, performance, and general health. However, RED-S is understudied among male athletes at the highest performance levels. This cross-sectional study aimed to investigate surrogate RED-S markers prevalence in Norwegian male Olympic-level athletes. Athletes (n = 44) aged 24.7 ± 3.8 years, body mass 81.3 ± 15.9 kg, body fat 13.7% ± 5.8%, and training volume 76.1 ± 22.9 hr/month were included. Assessed parameters included resting metabolic rate (RMR), body composition, and bone mineral density by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry and venous blood variables (testosterone, free triiodothyronine, cortisol, and lipids). Seven athletes (16%) grouped by the presence of low RMR (RMRratio < 0.90) (0.81 ± 0.07 vs. 1.04 ± 0.09, p < .001, effect size 2.6), also showed lower testosterone (12.9 ± 5.3 vs. 19.0 ± 5.3 nmol/L, p = .020) than in normal RMR group. In low RMRratio individuals, prevalence of other RED-S markers (—subclinical—low testosterone, low free triiodothyronine, high cortisol, and elevated low-density lipoprotein) was (N/number of markers): 2/0, 2/1, 2/2, 1/3. Low bone mineral density (z-score < −1) was found in 16% of the athletes, all with normal RMR. Subclinical low testosterone and free triiodothyronine levels were found in nine (25%) and two (5%) athletes, respectively. Subclinical high cortisol was found in 23% of athletes while 34% had elevated low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels. Seven of 12 athletes with two or more RED-S markers had normal RMR. In conclusion, this study found that multiple RED-S markers also exist in male Olympic-level athletes. This highlights the importance of regular screening of male elite athletes, to ensure early detection and treatment of RED-S.\n\nShow summary\n\nWe examined both direct and indirect effects of the Healthy Body Image (HBI) intervention on positive embodiment among Norwegian high school students. In total, 2446 12th grade boys (43 %) and girls (mean age 16.8 years) from 30 schools participated in a cluster-randomized controlled study with the HBI intervention and a control condition as the study arms. We tested mediation models using path analysis and found that among several hypothesized mediators, only self-esteem mediated a positive intervention effect on positive embodiment for both boys and girls. A direct effect of the intervention on positive embodiment was only found in girls. The study provides novel findings indicating that health promotion interventions to address a positive embodiment should focus on enhancing adolescent’s self-esteem. Serial mediation modeling might reveal more complex explanations of change mechanisms and could further evolve current knowledge.\n\nShow summary\n\nObjectives: To enhance knowledge on pregnancy and return to sport in the postpartum period in elite female athletes. Methods: 34 Norwegian elite athletes (33.1 years) and 34 active controls (31.5 years) were asked about training and competitive history, pregnancy-related issues, injuries, body dissatisfaction (BD), drive for thinness (DT), eating disorders (ED) and practical experiences, through a questionnaire and interview. Independent samples T-tests or χ² tests for between-group differences and paired-samples T-tests and repeated measures analysis of variance for within group differences were used. Results: No group differences in fertility problems, miscarriage, preterm birth or low birth weight were found. Both groups decreased training volume all trimesters and the first two postpartum periods compared with prepregnancy, and more athletes returned to sport/exercise at week 0–6 postpartum. We found no group differences in complications during pregnancy and delivery, but athletes reported fewer common complaints. Four athletes experienced stress fracture postpartum. Athletes had higher BD and DT postpartum, while controls reduced DT score. Number of athletes with clinical ED was reduced postpartum, while constant in controls. Athletes were not satisfied with advice related to strength training and nutrition during pregnancy. Conclusion: Elite athletes and active controls get pregnant easily, deliver healthy babies and decrease training during pregnancy and the first postpartum periods compared with prepregnancy. Most athletes and every third control returned to sport or exercise at week 0–6 postpartum. Athletes report stress fractures and increased BD and DT, but decreased ED postpartum. However, since relatively few athletes were included these findings need further investigation.\n\nShow summary\n\nWe examined the effects of the Healthy Body Image (HBI) intervention on positive embodiment and health-related quality of life among Norwegian high school students. The intervention comprised three interactive workshops, with body image, media literacy, and lifestyle as main themes. In total, 2,446 12th grade boys (43%) and girls (mean age 16.8 years) from 30 high schools participated in a cluster-randomized controlled study with the HBI intervention and a control condition as the study arms. Data were collected at baseline, post-intervention, 3- and 12-months follow-up, and analysed using linear mixed regression models. The HBI intervention caused a favourable immediate change in positive embodiment and health-related quality of life among intervention girls, which was maintained at follow-up. Among intervention boys, however, weak post-intervention effects on embodiment and health-related quality of life vanished at the follow-ups. Future studies should address steps to make the HBI intervention more relevant for boys as well as determine whether the number of workshops or themes may be shortened to ease implementation and to enhance intervention effects.\n\nShow summary\n\nIntroduction: The beneficial effects of physical activity during pregnancy for the mother and offspring have been reported by several studies but there are conflicting results concerning the possible effect of physical activity on the course of labor and risk of cesarean delivery. This study presents secondary analyses from the Norwegian Fit for Delivery randomized controlled trial, aiming at studying the effect of a lifestyle intervention including group exercise classes, as well as the possible influence of physical activity level in late pregnancy, on labor outcomes. Material and methods: Healthy nulliparous women with singleton pregnancy were randomized to an intervention group, n = 303 (dietary counseling and twice‐weekly exercise classes) or a control group, n = 303 (standard care). The participants were analyzed both by randomization and as a cohort comparing women with lowest (quartile 1, 0 metabolic equivalent of task‐hours moderate‐to‐vigorous physical activity/week) (n = 140) vs. highest (quartile 4, ≥16 metabolic equivalent of task‐hours moderate‐to‐vigorous physical activity/week) (n = 131) physical activity level in late pregnancy, assessed with the International Physical Activity Questionnaire. Result: The intervention group had a longer first stage of labor compared with the control group (293 ± 202 min vs. 257 ± 181 min, p = 0.030). No differences between the randomization groups were seen for time spent in second stage of labor, prolonged labor or mode of delivery. In the total sample, women with the highest physical activity level had lower odds ratio (OR) of acute cesarean delivery (OR 0.33, 95% CI 0.11–0.97, p = 0.044) than did those with the lowest physical activity‐level. Conclusion: A significantly longer first stage of labor was observed in the intervention group than in the control group. A high physical activity level in late pregnancy was associated with lower odds of acute cesarean delivery compared with a low physical activity level.\n\nShow summary\n\nIn persons with anorexia nervosa (AN), compulsive exercise and osteopenia are common symptoms. Although treatment of osteopenia besides weight regain is lacking, maximal strength training (MST) has been found to be effective in other populations. Such training has not been prescribed to those with AN due to uncertainty of tolerance. We therefore examined use of MST in a woman with long-standing AN, osteopenia, menstrual dysfunction, and compulsive exercise. The MST intervention consisted of four exercises: three sets of five repetitions maximum (RM), 3 times per week for 16 weeks. We examined muscle strength, bone mineral density (BMD), AN psychopathology, and compulsive exercise at baseline, posttest, and 6-month follow-up. Attendance rate was 100%. The subject improved muscle strength by 20% to 40%. BMD in lumbar spine improved by 4% to posttest, and by 8% from baseline to 6-month follow-up. The BMD T-scores shifted from values classified as osteopenic to normal values throughout the course of the intervention, despite continuance of menstrual dysfunction and lack of weight gain. No changes in AN psychopathology or levels of compulsive exercise were detected. Perceived psychological benefits including new bodily experiences were self-reported by the subject, emphasizing the importance of close follow-up by competent instructors.\n\nShow summary\n\nBackground: To develop effective health promotional and preventive prenatal programs, it is important to understand perceived barriers to leisure-time physical activity during pregnancy, including exercise and sport participation. The aims of the present study was 1) to assess the effect of prenatal lifestyle intervention on the perceived barrier to leisure-time physical activity during pregnancy and the first year after delivery and 2) identify the most important perceived barriers to leisure-time physical activity at multiple time points during and after pregnancy. Methods: This secondary analysis was part of the Norwegian Fit for Delivery study, a combined lifestyle intervention evaluated in a blinded, randomized controlled trial. Healthy, nulliparous women with singleton pregnancy of ≤20 gestational weeks, age ≥ 18 years and body mass index ≥19 kg/m2 were recruited via healthcare clinics in southern Norway, including urban and rural settings. Participants were randomized to either twice-weekly supervised exercise sessions and nutritional counselling (n = 303) or standard prenatal care (n = 303). The principal analysis was based on the participants who completed the standardized questionnaire assessing their perceived barriers to leisure-time physical activity at inclusion (gestational week 16, n = 589) and following intervention (gestational week 36, n = 509), as well as six months (n = 470) and 12 months (n = 424) postpartum. Results: Following intervention (gestation week 35.4 ± 1.0), a significant between-group difference in perceived barriers to leisure-time physical activity was found with respect to time constraints: “... I do not have the time” (intervention: 22 vs. control: 38, p = 0.030), mother-child safety concerns: “... afraid to harm the baby” (intervention: 8 vs. control: 25, p = 0.002) and self-efficacy: “... I do not believe/think that I can do it” (intervention: 3 vs. control: 10, p = 0.050). No positive effect was seen at postpartum follow-up. Intrapersonal factors (lack of time, energy and interest) were the most frequently perceived barriers, and consistent over time among all participants. Conclusion: The intervention had effect on intrapersonal perceived barriers in pregnancy, but not in the postpartum period. Perceived barriers to leisure-time physical activity were similar from early pregnancy to 12 months postpartum.\n\nShow summary\n\nObesity prevalence has increased the past decades and has become a serious public health problem. The aim of this six-month assessor-blinded, parallel-group randomized controlled trial was to assess the effect of a tailored telephone and email-based exercise intervention on various measures of body composition in a sample of apparently healthy and physically inactive adults. A total of 111 volunteering adults (40–55 yr) in Southern Norway were randomly assigned to an intervention group (IG; n = 39) or a no-information control group (CG; n = 50), by random allocation numbering. The IG received feedback on their health-related physical fitness, information on guidelines and recommendations for physical activity, a leaflet on national dietary recommendations, prompts and reminders in addition to three tailored exercise programs, one every two months, and fortnightly motivational counselling by email or telephone, alternately. The CG received no follow-up during the intervention period. The main outcome measures: weight, body mass index (BMI), waist circumference (WC) and fat percentage by skinfolds (FPskf) were assessed objectively at baseline and posttest. A one-way ANCOVA analysis, adjusted for baseline scores, gender, age, and educational level, revealed a larger reduction on all body compositional measures in the IG compared to the CG (p ≤ 0.043), except for BMI when adjusted for baseline scores. Additionally, a significantly higher percentage of the IG (64.1%) achieved a clinically significant reduction in FPskf compared to the CG (36.2%, p = 0.018). This six-month tailored telephone and email-based exercise intervention induced significant reductions on several measures of body composition in physically inactive adults.\n\nShow summary\n\nEndurance athletes are at increased risk of relative energy deficiency associated with metabolic perturbation and impaired health. We aimed to estimate and compare within-day energy balance in male athletes with suppressed and normal resting metabolic rate (RMR) and explore whether within-day energy deficiency is associated with endocrine markers of energy deficiency. A total of 31 male cyclists, triathletes, and long-distance runners recruited from regional competitive sports clubs were included. The protocol comprised measurements of RMR by ventilated hood and energy intake and energy expenditure to predict RMRratio (measured RMR/predicted RMR), energy availability, 24-hr energy balance and within-day energy balance in 1-hr intervals, assessment of body composition by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry, and blood plasma analysis. Subjects were categorized as having suppressed (RMRratio 0.90, n = 11) RMR. Despite there being no observed differences in 24-hr energy balance or energy availability between the groups, subjects with suppressed RMR spent more time in an energy deficit exceeding 400 kcal (20.9 [18.8-21.8] hr vs. 10.8 [2.5-16.4], p = .023) and had larger single-hour energy deficits compared with subjects with normal RMR (3,265 ± 1,963 kcal vs. -1,340 ± 2,439, p = .023). Larger single-hour energy deficits were associated with higher cortisol levels (r = -.499, p = .004) and a lower testosterone:cortisol ratio (r = .431, p = .015), but no associations with triiodothyronine or fasting blood glucose were observed. In conclusion, within-day energy deficiency was associated with suppressed RMR and catabolic markers in male endurance athletes.\n\nShow summary\n\nBackground: Despite documented health benefits for mother and baby, physical activity (PA)-level tends to decline in pregnancy. Overweight/obese and physically inactive women are two selected groups at increased risk of pregnancy complications. Thus, efficient strategies to maintain or increase PA-level in pregnancy and the postpartum period, especially among these women, are warranted. This secondary analysis examined the effect of a prenatal lifestyle-intervention on PA-level in late pregnancy and the first year postpartum, with subanalysis on initially physically active versus inactive and normal-weight versus overweight/obese women. Method: The Norwegian Fit for Delivery (NFFD) randomized controlled trial included healthy primiparous women with singleton pregnancies and body mass index (BMI) ≥19 kg/m2 assigned to an intervention group, n = 303 (twice weekly group-exercises and dietary counseling) or a control group, n = 303 (standard prenatal care). The International Physical Activity Questionnaire short-form was used to assess PA-levels at inclusion (mean gestational week (GW) 16), GW 36, and six and 12 months postpartum. Results: At GW 36, a positive intervention-effect with a significant between-group difference in total PA-level compared to time of inclusion was found for the total group (530 MET-min/week, p = 0.001) and the subgroups of normal-weight (533 MET-min/week, p = 0.003) and initially active women (717 MET-min/week, p<0.001). Intervention-effect was dependent on exercise-adherence among overweight/obese and inactive women. Compared to time of inclusion, the intervention groups maintained total PA-level at GW 36, while total PA-level decreased in the control groups. The PA-levels increased postpartum, but with no significant differences between the randomization groups. Conclusion: The NFFD prenatal combined lifestyle intervention had a significant effect on TPA-level in late pregnancy among women entering pregnancy normal-weight or physically active, thereby preventing the downward trend typically seen during pregnancy. Intervention-effect among overweight/obese and physically inactive women was, however, dependent on exercise-adherence. Long-term intervention-effect was not observed in the postpartum period.\n\nShow summary\n\nBackground: The International Physical Activity Questionnaire short-form (IPAQ-SF) is frequently used to assess physical activity (PA) level in the general adult population including pregnant women. However, the reliability and validity of the questionnaire in pregnancy is unknown. Therefore, the aims of the present study were to investigate test-retest reliability and concurrent validity of IPAQ-SF among pregnant women, and whether PA is reported differently among those who fulfill (active) vs. do not fulfill (inactive) recommendations of ≥150 min of weekly moderate intensity PA in pregnancy. Method: Test-retest reliability was examined by answering IPAQ-SF twice, two weeks apart (n = 88). To assess validity, IPAQ-SF was compared to the physical activity monitor SenseWear Armband® (SWA) (n = 64). The participants wore SWA for 8 consecutive days before answering IPAQ-SF. PA level was reported as time spent in moderate-, vigorous- and moderate-to-vigorous intensity PA (MPA, VPA and MVPA) corresponding to the cut-off points 3–6, >6 and >3 Metabolic Equivalents (METs), respectively. Results: Test-retest intraclass-correlation of MPA, VPA and MVPA ranged from 0.81-0.84 (95% Confidence Intervals: 0.69,0.90). Comparing time spent performing PA at various intensities; the mean differences and limits of agreement (±1.96 Standard Deviation) from Bland-Altman plots were−84 ± 402 min/week for MPA,−85 ± 452 min/week for MVPA and 26 ± 78 min/week for VPA, illustrating that the total group under-reported MPA by 72% and MVPA by 52%, while VPA was over-reported by 1400%. For the inactive group corresponding numbers were 44 ± 327 min/week for MPA, 52 ± 355 min/week for MVPA and 16 ± 33 min/week for VPA, illustrating that the inactive group over-reported MPA by 13% and MVPA by 49%, while VPA was not detected by SWA, but participants reported 16 min of VPA/week. In contrast, corresponding numbers for the active group were−197 ± 326 min/week for MPA,−205 ± 396 min/week for MVPA and 35 ± 85 min/week for VPA, illustrating that the active group under-reported MPA by 81% and MVPA by 60%, while they over-reported VPA by 975%. Conclusion: IPAQ-SF had good test-retest reliability, but low to fair concurrent validity for MPA, VPA and MVPA compared to an objective criterion measure among pregnant women. Further, women fulfilling PA guidelines in pregnancy under-reported, while inactive women over-reported PA level.\n\nShow summary\n\nObjective: To evaluate the implementation of a community-based exercise intervention (the Norwegian Fit for Delivery study) during pregnancy. Design: Descriptive, explorative. Setting: Healthcare clinics in southern Norway, including urban and rural settings. Participants: Healthy, nulliparous women with singleton pregnancy of ≤20 gestational weeks, age ≥18 years and body mass index ≥19 kg/m2. Methods: Women were randomized to either twice-weekly supervised exercise sessions combined with nutritional counselling (n=303) or standard prenatal care (n=303). The exercise program was based on ACOG guidelines, with the same low-impact workout for all participants, including 60 minutes of moderate-intensity cardiovascular and strength training, performed in a group of maximum 25 women. The aim of the present secondary analysis was to report on the intervention group's experience with participating in an exercise program in the 2nd and 3rd trimester, including satisfaction, adherence, adverse effects, as well as motives and barriers for attending the classes. Results: Of 303 women randomized to exercise, 274 (92.6%) attended at least one class and 187 (68.2%) completed a questionnaire after completion of the trial assessing their experience with the group sessions. For 71.7%, self-reported exercise dosage was ≥75% of the twice-weekly exercise program and more than seven out of 10 reported to be satisfied or very satisfied with the exercise sessions. A total of 95.1% answered that they would recommend this type of exercise for pregnant friends. Reported motives and health benefits included better aerobic capacity, increased energy levels and exercise enjoyment. No harmful effects of the exercise intervention were noted in the mother or the fetus. Key conclusions and implications for practice: Results demonstrated that regular group exercise was feasible, safe, and well tolerated in pregnancy, which may encourage incorporating this program into a routine health care setting."
