        "text": "The new channel structure replaces the current Viasat Sport 1, 2 and 3 channels and reflects the growing demand for localised premium sports content. The new channels will also continue to feature a wide range of major international sports rights including UEFA Champions League football and Formula One motor racing. Both these exclusive rights have today been prolonged to the end of the 2011/2012 seasons. Viasat Football will be Sweden’s only dedicated football channel and have exclusive live broadcasting rights to UEFA Champions League matches; 2010 World Cup qualification games including Sweden, England and Germany’s home fixtures and South American national side qualifying games; the English FA Cup and League Cup championships; Chelsea and Manchester United club TV; the French league; and the German Bundesliga. Viasat Sport in Norway will also have exclusive coverage of the best from UEFA Champions League, the 2010 World Cup qualification games, the English FA Cup and League Cup championships, as well as Formula One, NFL, boxing, cycling, and ice hockey from the Norwegian Get league and Ice Hockey World Championship. Viasat Motor will be the region’s only dedicated motorsports channel and will be available in both Sweden and Norway. The channel will feature the most extensive Formula One coverage imaginable, including live coverage of each race and the qualifying sessions. The channel has also acquired the rights to the MotoGP motorcycle grand prix championship and the Swedish Touring Car Championships, and will also carry the NASCAR Sprint Cup Series from the US. Viasat Sport viewers in Sweden will have access to the Ice Hockey World Championships, Champions Hockey League and Russian KHL League ice hockey, as well as the most extensive coverage ever in Sweden of NFL American football, ATP Masters Series and Davis Cup tennis, and Swedish basketball league and Euroleague basketball. Viasat also has the rights to the European and World basketball championships in 2009 and 2010, respectively. The Danish sports channel offering continues to consist of a powerful offering including joint venture pay-TV channels TV2 Sport and TV2 Sport HD, as well as Viasat Golf. Free-TV channel TV3+ also broadcasts extensive sports coverage including the Danish football league and, from next season and for the first time, Formula One motor racing. Hans-Holger Albrecht, President and CEO of MTG, commented: “Quite simply, we now have the most compelling sports line-up and the most attractive channel offering across each of the Scandinavian markets. Pay-TV subscribers increasingly want dedicated channels with premium local sports content and coverage of the world’s major sporting events, and that is what we are delivering on our own satellite platform, as well as to cable and IPTV networks across the region. The migration of premium sports coverage to our pay-TV channels reflects both the increasing number of localised sports channels in our pay-TV package offerings and the positioning of these channels to provide the very best sports entertainment for paying viewers. We are however continuing to make some of the highest profile sports events available on our broader free-TV entertainment channels in each country, and providing an ever increasing level of content via the internet and to mobile devices”. *** For further information, please visit www.mtg.se or contact: Hans-Holger Albrecht, President & CEO Tel: +46 (0) 8 562 000 50 Investor & Analyst Enquiries Matthew Hooper / Oscar Hyléen Tel: +44 (0) 7768 440 414 / +46 (0) 707 620 024 Email: investor.relations@mtg.se Press Enquiries Bert Willborg Tel: +44 (0) 791 2280 850 Email: bert.willborg@mtg.se"
