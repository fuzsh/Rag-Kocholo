        "text": "SAM – Scandinavian Audiovisual Metadata group\n\nPublisert 08.05.2001 14:45 - Oppdatert 10.05.2001 10:47\n\nRepresentatives of the radio archives and the national libraries/archives of the Scandinavian countries met in Århus, Denmark in August 2000. The agenda of the meeting was to establish a structured and effective cooperation within the field of metadata.\n\nTo best achieve this goal a working group was established.\n\nThe members of the working group were:\n\nElsebeth Kirring, State & University Library, Århus\n\nPer Holst, Danish Broadcasting Corporation\n\nBerit Stifjeld, National Library of Norway, Rana Division, later replaced by Hilde Høgås\n\nGunnel Jönsson, Swedish Broadcasting Resources, Program archive\n\nOlle Johansson, National Archive of Recorded Sound and Moving Images, Stockholm\n\nMarit Grimstad, Norwegian Broadcasting Corporation\n\nThe meeting in Århus discussed the group’s work and agreed on the following mandate for the group:\n\nThe Scandinavian Radio Archives and National Libraries has decided to establish a Scandinavian metadata group with the responsibility of developing a minimum standard for metadata within the area of Broadcasting material and other AV media. The work is to be coordinated with similar work within the EBU and other international organizations\n\nAlready at the meeting in Århus it was decided that the group should base its standard on the existing international standard “Dublin Core” The Dublin Core is as the name signifies a “core standard” meaning that a core of data is common while it allows great local diversity.\n\nThe group has mainly worked through email. We have had one meeting in Copenhagen in November 2000 and one in Århus in April 2001.\n\nThe group also spent some time to further detail the mandate as follows:\n\nWe are mainly working towards a standard for retrieval and transfer of data files between institutions and on an international level. To achieve this we need a minimum list of data (a core list) that can be exported in a format that can be internationally recognized by computer programmes. Locally within each institution the need for data is greater and more specialized. Each institution has their own local databases with all the archival data needed in that institution’s work. All local databases should be able to export data records in the Dublin Core format.\n\nWhat is metadata\n\nMetadata literally means ”data about data”. Any catalogue – card or online – contains metadata. But today the term is increasingly applied by information professionals to the value-added information that they create to arrange, describe, track and otherwise enhance access to information objects.\n\nWhy metadata\n\nThe amount of information and networked resources produced are heavily growing. The backside of this growth is increasing difficulty in finding the relevant information among all available information. To solve this problem we have to enhance the possibilities to find the information. The traditional way to catalogue a document – thoroughly describing any possible information – is not cost effective (or really possible) when you are facing the digital world of today. What might be possible is to describe, in a standardized way, the information necessary to locate the document – in other words – to provide a minimum set of metadata.\n\nMetadata provides a standard way to describe network accessible material\n\nMetadata enables you to make more precise queries\n\nMetadata helps the search engines to present hits grouped by subject rather than a random mix.\n\nIt’s relatively easy to make a list of all the information you can imagine that someone might sometimes find useful in a specific situation – it’s more difficult (but more valuable) to put yourself in the users place and say, Hey, which data do I need to find the information I want.\n\nAnd remember: If you only want 10 % of your resources catalogued/described – use a maximum list with all mandatory fields. But if you intend to describe all your resources – then make a minimum list (which can be extended locally if necessary) with the essential data.\n\nWhy Dublin Core: background (origin), dissemination, recognition\n\nDublin Core has nothing to do with the capital city of Ireland. No, it’s Dublin, Ohio, home of OCLC (Online Computer Library Centre). And it’s the place where The Dublin Core 15 Element Set was proposed and published as DC version 1.0 in December 1996 by the Dublin Core Metadata community.\n\nThe Dublin Core Metadata Element Set (DCMES) grew out of a recognized need for improved resource discovery of web resources. Initially it focused on the requirement of simplicity: ”ordinary” users should be able to formulate descriptive records based on a relatively simple scheme. But over the years there has been a movement to use the DCMES for more complex and specialized resource description tasks and, correspondingly, develop mechanisms for incorporating such complexity within the basic element set. This work is called qualified Dublin Core.\n\nNobody is claiming that Dublin Core is the perfect solution to the problems of resource discovery. But there is consensus that it is suitably subject-neutral to serve as a starting point for providing some form of solution. It has aroused considerable interest since it was consolidated in 1996 and it is obvious that it has many qualities:\n\nIt is a relatively simple format which can be endlessly extended with local fields\n\nIt has international support\n\nIt has proved helpful to users in finding things\n\nIt is broadly recognised and supported\n\nIt can be used directly in websites and as records in a database because of the way it is structured\n\nIt is maintained in a stable environment, and\n\nIt is continuing development seems assured.\n\nAnd, it is proving to be hospitable to a wide range of disciplines and domains, including sound recordings and moving images.\n\nThe Core Elements\n\nThe elements are listed in the order they were developed by the The Dublin Core Metadata Initiative (DCMI), but there are other useful ways to group them. In the following table, you can see that some elements relate to the content of the item, some to the item as intellectual property, still others to the particular instantiation, or version, of the item.\n\nContent Intellectual Property Instantiation or Version\n\nCoverage Contributor Date\n\nDescription Creator Format\n\nType Publisher Identifier\n\nRelation Rights Language\n\nSource\n\nSubject\n\nTitle\n\nDefinitions of Qualifiers\n\nElement Refinement: These qualifiers make the meaning of an element narrower or more specific. A refined element shares the meaning of the unqualified element, but with a more restricted scope. A client that does not understand a specific element refinement term should be able to ignore the qualifier and treat the metadata value as if it were an unqualified (broader) element. The definitions of element refinement terms for qualifiers must be publicly available.\n\nElement Encoding Scheme: These qualifiers identify schemes that aid in the interpretation of an element value. These schemes include controlled vocabularies and formal notations or parsing rules. A value expressed using an encoding scheme will thus be a token selected from a controlled vocabulary (e.g., a term from a classification system or set of subject headings) or a string formatted in accordance with a formal notation (e.g., \"2000-01-01\" as the standard expression of a date). If an encoding scheme is not understood by a client or agent, the value may still be useful to a human reader. The definitive description of an encoding scheme for qualifiers must be clearly identified and available for public use.\n\nMetadata for Audiovisual Resources\n\nThe following element set is based on Dublin Core extended with qualifiers to comply with the special needs for audiovisual resources within the area of Broadcasting material and other audiovisual media.\n\nIt is a minimum set of metadata useable for exchanging data between broadcasters and between broadcasters and national archives. It might be extended locally if needed. A model for data exchange is described in Appendix 1, The Media Archive Warehouse by Ole Hybæk Nielsen, DR.\n\nSAM’s suggestion based on the Dublin Core\n\nElement: Title\n\nName: Title\n\nDefinition: A name given to the resource.\n\nComment: Typically, a title will be a name by which the resource is formally known.\n\nSAM Comment: The title is tied to the archived item; a series – series title, a programme – a programme title, an item – an item title. To differentiate between a series title and programme title when these are identical. Recommended best practice is to a date along the programme title. E.G. News is the series title. News 2000.11.12 is the programme title. Titles are recorded as they appear.\n\nElement refinement: Alternative\n\nComment: Any form of the title used as a substitute or alternative to the formal title of the resource.\n\nElement: Creator\n\nName: Creator\n\nDefinition: An entity primarily responsible for making the content of the resource.\n\nComment: Examples of a Creator include a person, an organisation, or a service. Typically, the name of a Creator should be used to indicate the entity.\n\nSAM Comment: It is recommended that names are written inverted; surname, first name, but they can also be written according to local practice.\n\nElement Refinement: Role\n\nElement Encoding scheme: SAM Role Authority list (appendix no.2)\n\nSAM Comment: The element refinement Role is added by SAM and not part of standard DCMES. The content of the qualifier Role must be taken from a controlled list of authorized roles. SAM Role Authority List is recommended, but can be extended to cover special local needs.\n\nElement: Subject\n\nName: Subject and Keywords\n\nDefinition: The topic of the content of the resource.\n\nComment: Typically, a Subject will be expressed as keywords, key phrases or classification codes that describe a topic of the resource. Recommended best practice is to select a value from a controlled vocabulary or formal classification scheme.\n\nSAM Comment: Persons as subjects are also placed here. Genre of the content is placed under element Type.\n\nElement Encoding schemes: LCSH (Library of congress Subject Heading)\n\nMeSH (Medical Subject Headings)\n\nDDC (Dewey Decimal Classification)\n\nDK5 (Dansk decimalklassedeling 5.utgave)\n\nSAB (Klassifikasjonssystem för svenska bibliotek)\n\nUDC (Universal Decimal Classification)\n\nNorske emneord\n\nElement: Description\n\nName: Description\n\nDefinition: An account of the content of the resource.\n\nComment: Description may include but is not limited to: an abstract, table of contents, reference to a graphical representation of content or a free-text account of the content.\n\nElement Refinement: Table of Content\n\nDefinition: A list of subunits of the content of the resource.\n\nElement Refinement: Abstract\n\nDefinition: A summary of the content of the resource.\n\nSAM Comment: For a Radio or television programme a running order can be used as description. SAM recommends not using the element refinements here, but instead just write a description of the content under the element itself.\n\nElement: Publisher\n\nName: Publisher\n\nDefinition: An entity responsible for making the resource available\n\nComment: Examples of a Publisher include a person, an organisation, or a service. Typically, the name of a Publisher should be used to indicate the entity.\n\nSAM Comment: The publisher given here is the entity which has made the resource available in digital form.\n\nElement: Contributor\n\nName: Contributor\n\nDefinition: An entity responsible for making contributions to the content of the resource.\n\nComment: Examples of a Contributor include a person, an organisation, or a service. Typically, the name of a Contributor should be used to indicate the entity.\n\nSAM Comment: If in doubt whether an entity is a creator or contributor use the element contributor. It is recommended that names are written inverted; surname, first name, but they can also be written according to local practice.\n\nElement Refinement Role\n\nElement Encoding scheme: SAM Role Authority List (appendix no.2)\n\nSAM Comment: The element refinement Role is added by SAM and not part of standard DCMES. The content of the qualifier Role must be taken from a controlled list of authorized roles. SAM Role Authority List is recommended, but can be extended to cover special local needs..\n\nElement: Date\n\nName: Date\n\nDefinition: A date associated with an event in the life cycle of the resource.\n\nComment: Typically, Date will be associated with the creation or availability of the resource. Recommended best practice for encoding the date value is defined in a profile of ISO 8601 [W3CDTF] and follows the YYYY-MM-DD format.\n\nElement Encoding scheme: DCMI Period\n\nW3C-DTF\n\nElement Refinement: Issued\n\nComment: Date of formal issuance (e.g. publication) of the resource.\n\nSAM Comment: It is recommended to use this element to show the date the content was issued, i.e. the broadcasting date of a radio programme. It is recommended best practice to use the element both for recordings that are “born-digital” and recordings that are digitised. The date for digitising is placed in Date.Digitised\n\nElement Refinement: Created\n\nSAM Comment: It is recommended to use this element to show the date the content was created. It is recommended best practice to use the element both for recordings that are “born-digital” and recordings that are digitised.\n\nElement Refinement: Digitised\n\nSAM Comment: The element refinement Digitised is added by SAM and not part of standard DCMES. The date an analogue recording is digitised is placed here.\n\nElement: Type\n\nName: Resource Type\n\nDefinition: The nature or genre of the content of the resource.\n\nComment: Type includes terms describing general categories, functions, genres, or aggregation levels for content. Recommended best practice is to select a value from a controlled vocabulary (for example, the working draft list of Dublin Core Types [DCT1]). To describe the physical or digital manifestation of the resource, use the FORMAT element.\n\nSAM Comment: If it is necessary to give more than one type repeat the type element.\n\nElement Encoding Schemes: DCT1\n\nSAM Type Authority List (appendix no.3)\n\nPTY display terms\n\nElement: Format\n\nName: Format\n\nDefinition: The physical or digital manifestation of the resource.\n\nComment: Typically, Format may include the media-type or dimensions of the resource. Format may be used to determine the software, hardware or other equipment needed to display or operate the resource. Examples of dimensions include size and duration.\n\nRecommended best practice is to select a value from a controlled vocabulary (for example, the list of Internet Media Types [MIME] defining computer media formats).\n\nElement Refinement: Extent\n\nDefinition: The size or duration of the resource\n\nSAM Comment: Recommended best practise is to use Extent to give the duration of a recording. The duration should be written in the form HHMMSS\n\nElement Refinement: Medium\n\nDefinition: The material or physical carrier of the resource\n\nComment: The content of the qualifier follows a list of authorized Media.\n\nElement Encoding schemes: IMT\n\nSam Format Authority List (appendix no.4)\n\nElement: Identifier\n\nName: Resource Identifier\n\nDefinition: An unambiguous reference to the resource within a given context.\n\nComment: Recommended best practice is to identify the resource by means of a string or number conforming to a formal identification system. Example formal identification systems include the Uniform Resource Identifier (URI) (including the Uniform Resource Locator (URL)), the Digital Object Identifier (DOI) and the International Standard Book Number (ISBN).\n\nSAM Comment Recommended best practice is the EBU standard UMID for broadcasting Resources.\n\nElement Encoding Schemes: UMID\n\nURI\n\nElement: Source\n\nName: Source\n\nDefinition: A Reference to a resource from which the present resource is derived.\n\nComment: The present resource may be derived from the Source resource in whole or in part. Recommended best practice is to reference the resource by means of a string or number conforming to a formal identification system.\n\nSam comment: Recommended best practice is to use a unique identifier to identify the physical Source which has been used to create the digital resource. In the case of a digitised analogue recording, it is the recording used for digitisation which is the source. For commercial recordings the label and number is normally given here. For talking books the ISBN and/or label and number for the talking book (not the original book) is given here. If no label or number is available, the title and/or the statement of responsibility etc. of the digitised recording is recorded here. For a digitised radio programme the production number is normally given here\n\nElement: Language\n\nName: Language\n\nDefinition: A language of the intellectual content of the resource.\n\nComment: Recommended best practice for the values of the Language element is defined by RFC 1766 [RFC1766] which includes a two-letter Language Code (taken from the ISO 639 standard [ISO639]), followed optionally, by a two-letter Country Code (taken from the ISO 3166 standard [ISO3166]). For example, 'en' for English, 'fr' for French, or 'en-uk' for English used in the United Kingdom.\n\nSAM Comment: Recommend best practise is to use the ISO-639-2 3 letter codes.\n\nElement Encoding scheme: ISO-639-2\n\nElement: Relation\n\nName: Relation\n\nDefinition: A reference to a related resource.\n\nComment: Recommended best practice is to reference the resource by means of a string or number conforming to a formal identification system.\n\nSAM Comment: Relation is used to show the relation in content to another resource. E.g. IsPartOf is used to show the relation between a part of a radio programme and the whole programme, or for a cut on a record album. If more to the point other information than identifier e.g. Title ca be given to show the relation to another resource.\n\nElement Refinement: IsVersionOf\n\nHasVersion\n\nIsReplacedBy\n\nReplaces\n\nIsRequiredBy\n\nRequires\n\nIsPartOf\n\nHasPart\n\nIsReferencedBy\n\nReferences\n\nIsFormatOf\n\nHasFormat\n\nElement Encoding schemes: URI\n\nUMID\n\nElement: Coverage\n\nName: Coverage\n\nDefinition: The extent or scope of the content of the resource.\n\nComment: Coverage will typically include spatial location (a place name or geographic coordinates), temporal period (a period label, date, or date range) or jurisdiction (such as a named administrative entity). Recommended best practice is to select a value from a controlled vocabulary (for example, the Thesaurus of Geographic Names [TGN]) and that, where appropriate, named places or time periods be used in preference to numeric identifiers such as sets of coordinates or date ranges.\n\nSAM Comment: Coverage is used to show various time and place aspects of the subject of the content. For example the geographical origin of folk music is placed here.\n\nElement Refinement: Spatial\n\nDefinition: Spatial characteristics of the content of the resource.\n\nElement Encoding Scheme: DCMI Point\n\nISO 3166\n\nDCMI Box\n\nTGN\n\nElement Refinement: Temporal\n\nDefinition: Temporal characteristics of the content of the resource.\n\nElement Encoding Scheme: DCMI Period\n\nW3C-DTF\n\nElement: Rights\n\nName: Rights Management\n\nDefinition: Information about rights held in and over the resource.\n\nComment: Typically, a Rights element will contain a rights management statement for the resource, or reference a service providing such information. Rights information often encompasses Intellectual Property Rights (IPR), Copyright, and various Property Rights. If the Rights element is absent, no assumptions can be made about the status of these and other rights with respect to the resource.\n\nSAM Comment: By rights we here mean the rights to the programme (sound file etc.) as a whole. For rights covering parts of the file (music, poetry etc included in the file) keep these in the institutions locally. Here register for instance NRK, BBC or the production company responsible for the programme or the record company which owns the rights to a phonogram. Here one can use an URL to point to places with more information on rights.\n\nSAM References\n\nDublin Core General\n\nDublin Core Metadata Element Set, Version 1.1: Reference Description\n\nDublin Core Metadata Element Set\n\nDublin Core Qualifiers\n\nDublin Core Qualifiers\n\nUsing Dublin Core\n\nUsing Dublin Core\n\nDublin Core Metadata for Resource Discovery.
