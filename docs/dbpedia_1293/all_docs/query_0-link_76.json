        "text": "Eastern Norway and Southern Norway: The warmest and most stable weather usually occurs here, especially on the south coast between Mandal and Oslo. Temperatures can reach as high as 25 degrees Celsius or more. The highest temperatures are often inland. Setesdal, Hallingdal, and Telemark are famous for record high temperatures. Along the coast, a cool sea breeze will often refresh you.\n\nFjord Norway: A coastal climate, with lots of rain and wind close to the coast. A lovely sunny day can be followed by a day of rain and fog, and vice versa. You can experience both in one day! Inner fjords often have a much drier and sunnier climate.\n\nTr√∏ndelag: The coastal climate varies quite a bit, with more stable and warmer weather further inland."
