They will augment equipment already available at hospitals as the Ministry works towards expanding quality healthcare services in line with Universal Health Coverage principles. This donation will undoubtedly ensure the safeguarding of lives and enhance the ability to treat and care for all patients in a timely manner. Additionally, this donation obviously lays the groundwork for future collaboration and promotes health and prosperity for all.\"\n\nDr. Shangula further highlighted the importance of readily available medical equipment in all health facilities nationwide.\n\nThe Minister commended Ohorongo Cement and the support of ULM e.v. while calling upon all stakeholders to join the Ministry in its efforts to improve service delivery."
