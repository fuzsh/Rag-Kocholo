        "text": "The Ohorongo Cement plant has recently received some important visitors. First, in the second week of February, the plant was visited by the Zambian Deputy High Commissioner, Ms Dorothy Nachilongo, and the Zambian First Secretary Political/Administration, Mr Lome Kachingwe, who visited the Ohorongo plant to check out the production facilities and the product quality. Ohorongo Cement has successfully passed the required audit to be able to export cement to Zambia and does so in small quantities. It has also obtained ISO 14001:2009 and ISO 9001:2008 certification, the environmental management and quality standards. Ms Nachilongo was so impressed with the Ohorongo Cement plant, that she expressed her desire to also erect such a plant in Zambia.\n\nThe second visit was from a delegation of eight people from the National Housing Enterprise (NHE), who visited the plant on 13 February to brainstorm possible future shared project interests. During the visit, both parties agreed to support Namibian businesses and products in line with the Governmentsâ€™ Growth At Home Initiative to also create local employment opportunities.\n\nAdapted from press release by Katherine Guenioui"
