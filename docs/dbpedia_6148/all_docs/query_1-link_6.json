        "text": "Oriole Resources PLC (AIM:ORR) CEO Tim Livesey joined Proactive's Stephen Gunnion with an update on the company's Senala gold project in Senegal after its partner at the project AGEM Senegal Exploration, part of Managem Group, completed a six-year earn-in period. Livesey said over the six years, AGEM aimed to earn up to 70% ownership through an $8 million investment but concluded the period with a roughly 59% stake. The Senala project, described as a \"legacy asset\" by Livesey, is part of Oriole's portfolio despite a recent focus on Cameroon. As the partnership moves forward, Livesey said Oriole will evaluate its involvement based on forthcoming work plans and budget proposals from the joint venture, considering the substantial investments required for further development. Oriole Resources PLC is an AIM-listed #gold #exploration company, operating in West Africa. Watch at #Proactive #ProactiveInvestors https://lnkd.in/eh57Pmat #AIM #ORR\n\n#siemreap #cambodia APOPO Cambodia Landmines & Bombs During the Vietnam War, the US dropped around 26 million bombs, with approximately 2.6 million remaining undetonated in fields, posing ongoing risks. Additionally, from internal civil conflicts, about six million landmines persist, requiring removal for the land to be returned to the people for farming. Over the past 25 years, efforts to remove these explosives have been continuous, with only 17% successfully deactivated. A notable and efficient method involves rats trained in Tanzania by the NGO APOPO, which operates in various Asian and African countries. These rats undergo a year of training before being deployed to Cambodia through the NGO to later assist in targeted areas. The cost of the explosives can reach up to $300 USD, and the overall deactivation process, which includes rat training, meals, personnel and camp sites, amounts to approximately $7,000 USD per explosive making it a costly and timely process. Life is not fair, but we can make a difference\n\nAnd I am clapping for you, too, Njieforti Princewill Gana. You are correct. We must not only seek to criticise, but to celebrate. Let us eradicate our harmful practices, but at the same time, let us be equally robust in sustaining the good and building on it. In so doing, we shall grow. In so growing, we shall lead. Cheers to Cameroon, plantain and celebrity farmers everywhere. #agribusiness #foodsecurity #sustainability"
