The remainder of the production will be sold to southern Angola, Botswana and Zambia, which due to poor domestic infrastructure can be more efficiently supplied from Namibia.\n\nSector(s)\n\nIndustry\n\nProposed EIB finance (Approximate amount)\n\nEUR 100 million.\n\nTotal cost (Approximate amount)\n\nEUR 210 million.\n\nEnvironmental aspects\n\nA Social and Environmental Study was undertaken, which included a satisfactory level of public consultations. The plant is expected to be built with satisfactory environmental standards.\n\nProcurement\n\nThe borrower, a private company, operates in a liberalised sector open to free market competition. The main equipment and services was tendered amongst specialised international engineering companies.\n\nStatus\n\nSigned - 13/11/2009"
