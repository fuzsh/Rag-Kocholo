Ohorongo, ongoing training is critical for the creation and maintenance of an adequate number of qualified staff. To enable the workforce to acquire the necessary skills, a large number of employees have already received suit- able training in Europe at Schwenk, Polysius and the Association of German Ce- ment Plants. In addition, a number of cement experts temporarily visit Ohorongo for periods of up to six months, during which Ohorongo employees receive hands-on, in-house training. Managing Director, Hans- Wilhelm SchÃ¼tte, said that the current exciting and important task is to roll out the sales and distribution network. With a production capacity of 700 000 tons of cement per annum, the Ohorongo plant will be able to supply about double the amount currently demanded by the local Namibian mar- ket. According to SchÃ¼tte, Ohorongoâs products will be available for purchase from a dense network of retailers throughout Namibia, as well as from vendors in southern Angola. SchÃ¼tte pointed out that in line with Ohorongoâs service ethos and keen appreciation of its clients, expert sales people stand by to develop made-to- measure solutions to meet their specific requirements. âMoreover, experienced and qualified technical advisors will stand by to assist cus- tomers in the appropriate application of Ohorongoâs products,â SchÃ¼tte added. All experts consulted are confident that Ohorongo will have a positive impact on the socio-economic environment of the region. This will be affected not only through poverty reduction as a result of increased employment, but also due to business oppor- tunities that will emerge as a direct result of Ohorongoâs operations. This is borne by the fact that already a number of companies have opened their doors in the Otjozond- jupa and Oshikoto regions in response to new trading openings. Given a multiplier effect of 5 â 7, it has been calculated that Ohorongoâs presence in the area will re- sult in the creation of 2 000 further additional jobs. Apart from the fact that the Otjozondjupa Region as such will benefit from Ohorongo, Namibia as a whole will also profit from the companyâs commercial activities. For example, while Namibia is currently a net importer of cement, in future Ohorongo will not only replace import- ed cement with a high qual- ity local product, but it will sell the commodity abroad, turning Namibia into a net cement exporting country.\n\nP:17\n\nWednesday February 09 2011 Ohorongo Ofï¬cial Opening Page 23 Daily SunMilestones of Ohorongo CementIssue of EPL (holder: Ongopolo) 25-11-2005 POWER LINE AFRICADiamond core drilling 12-03-2006Purchasing of EPL 3371 from Ongopolo 19-05-2006 PO Box 1468 Tsumeb Namibia Tel +264 67 220750Founding of Ohorongo 03-06-2006Public participation process & public meetings 20-09-2007 Thank you Ohorongo Cement forGeological resource calculation report 10-02-2008 investing in our beloved andEnvironmental Impact Assessment & beautiful country, Namibia.Environmental Management Plan 13-02-2008Issue of Mining License No. 153 06-07-2008 May the foundations you haveFinal business decision 08-07-2008 casted now, remain strong for allSigning of turn-key contract with Polysius 14-07-2008Milestone event in Windhoek 13-08-2008 generations.Starting work on access road 28-08-2008Arrival of cement from Schwenk for plant construction 08-12-2008 P.O.BOX 1328, TSUMEBStart of construction of the Ohorongo cement plant 01-01-2009 TEL: 067-221910 / 221456, FAX: 067 â 221556Groundbreaking ceremony 29-01-2009Signing of agreement with TransNamib to construct 566 HAGE GEINGOB Avenueprivate siding 16-12-2009Roof wetting celebrating 04-02-2010 QWAufafaotleridtryparHboaloerï¬dPnwrgiacPerreso.,dEulectcstrAicvaalilaanbdle atFirst blast in quarry 25-03-2010First group of recruits sent to Germany for training 27-04-2010 LceetmâsebnutialdnwewithNOahmoirboinagoSwitch over from 11 kV to 132 kV power supply 12-08-2010Securing iron ore supply from Okorusu 12-08-2010Securing gypsum supply from Elpse Minerals 25-08-2010First clinker production 28-11-2010First cement production 08-12-2010Ofï¬cial opening by Pres.
