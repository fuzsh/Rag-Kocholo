        "text": "Cement factory in Namibia\n\nOhorongo Cement is a cement factory on farm Sargberg near Otavi in the Otjozondjupa Region of Namibia. It is one of two Namibian cement factories and has a production capacity of 0.7 Mt (690,000 long tons; 770,000 short tons) per annum.[1]\n\nThe ground breaking ceremony for the construction of the plant was held in January 2009.[2] A roof wetting celebration took place in February 2010, when the preheater tower reached its final height of 109 meters.[3] Production started in December 2010.\n\nInitially wholly owned by the Schwenk Zement KG,[4] Ohorongo states that ownership is to be transferred to Namibian institutions over time.[5] In 2019, Schwenk still owned 69.83%, with the Development Bank of Namibia the largest minority shareholder. After the 2018 production start of Cheetah Cement, a second, larger, cement factory nearby, Schwenk offered its shareholding for sale.[1] A 2019 acquisition offer by investment company West China Cement, however, was turned down by the Namibian Competition Commission because West China already owns Cheetah Cement.[6]"
