        "text": "30 Best Alfred Hitchcock Movies Ranked\n\nThis post may contain affiliate links\n\nHitchcock Blondes, why Alfred Hitchcock was such a great director, and the best Alfred Hitchcock Movies & Filmography ranked from the ‘Master of Suspense.’\n\nAlfred Hitchcock was nicknamed “The Master of Suspense,” for good reason, his mastery of the suspense genre and how he kept audiences in suspense for decades across his long career.\n\nA number of his films consistently rank as the greatest films of all time.\n\nHitchcock directed over 50 films, in addition to helping with dozens of other films, and also directed a famous television series.\n\nAlthough he launched his career in the UK (his \"British period\"), upon arriving to Hollywood, he was able to create bigger productions with famous stars from the Hollywood Golden Age.\n\nWhy was Alfred Hitchcock such a successful director?\n\nAlfred Hitchcock was such a successful director since he harnessed his incredible IQ, palpable film fanaticism, and brute work ethic into a singular goal--turning his cinematic dreams into reality.\n\nThis included meticulously managing every aspect of making a film.\n\nEvery single intricate detail mattered to him, including the story, setting, characters, actors, and even their wardrobes.\n\nIn terms of wardrobes and costumes, Alfred Hitchcock paid passionate detail to his characters' styles and looks.\n\nTheir outfits set the mood and atmosphere, and brought his stories to life.\n\nWhether it was the leather bomber coat of a military man on the run or it was Kim Novak's iconic gray suit in Vertigo, these was crucial elements to his films.\n\nFor 11 of his films, he enlisted the legendary Old Hollywood costume designer Edith Head, to work with him.\n\nHitchcock was also paid painstaking detail to the casting of his characters.\n\nFrom the leads to the side characters, he chose the very best for the role.\n\nSome of his favorites included the Old Hollywood legends like Cary Grant, Joseph Cotton, Jimmy Stewart, Grace Kelly, and Ingrid Bergman.\n\nHitchcock Blondes\n\n\"Blondes make the best victims. They're like virgin snow that shows up the bloody footprints.\" -- Alfred Hitchcock\n\nHitchcock is also famous for creating the idea of a \"Hitchcock Blonde.”\n\nThis is basically the vintage version of a bond girl...or perhaps more fitting, the 50’s version of the film noir era’s femme fatales.\n\nThey are perfectly coiffed and dressed, cool and aloof, always sexy and sometimes dangerous.\n\nThink of Grace Kelly in To Catch a Thief or Kim Novak in Vertigo.\n\nAccording to The Take, a Hitchcock blonde is:\n\n“...a beautiful, sophisticated, poised woman who carries with her an air of mystery and indirect sex appeal. She carries the film as an unexpected source of duplicity, and can be a cunning and intelligent adversary. She also represents Hitchcock’s idea of a perfect woman.”\n\nWe done our very best to rank the Hitchcock films below, but they are the work of a genius, so you could say that they are in no particular order.\n\nAlfred Hitchcock Best Movies Ranked #1 - Vertigo (1958)\n\nWatch on Amazon\n\nA romantic mystery thriller starring James Stewart, Kim Novak, and Barbara Bel Geddes.\n\nA former San Francisco police detective, who struggles with a crippling fear of heights, is pulled into a web of intrigue, after his friend asks him to trail his hauntingly beautiful (and possibly insane) wife.\n\nKim Novak portrays a cool “Hitchcock blonde” in Vertigo, with Hitchcock helping design her wardrobe, along with Edith Head.\n\nFor a movie recap and to see all of her stunning fashion in the film, you might like:\n\nKim Novak’s Wardrobe in Vertigo makes her the Ultimate Hitchcock Blonde\n\nGreatest Alfred Hitchcock Filmography #2 - North by Northwest (1959)\n\nWatch on Amazon\n\nA suspenseful thriller starring Cary Grant, Eva Marie Saint, and James Mason.\n\nA dashing New York advertising executive goes on a cross country run for his life, after he is mistaken for an important government agent.
