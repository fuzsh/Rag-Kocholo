        "text": "These are good times for Alfred Hitchcock. The refurbishment of the director’s reputation, which began in 1966 when François Truffaut published his landmark book of interviews, “Hitchcock/Truffaut,” reached its conclusion in 2012 when the film critics polled by Sight and Sound voted “Vertigo” the greatest film of all time, kicking Orson Welles’s “Citizen Kane” from a top spot it had enjoyed for decades. Wellesians bit their knuckles, and the rest of us scratched our heads. “Vertigo” is not Hitchcock’s best, but rather, with its lush morbidity, somnolent pace, poor box office and relative scarcity of jokes, the Hitchcock film for those who most wish he were French. Flops make film critics feel useful — they are the film-crit equivalent of the deserving poor. What else can you do with a gleaming hit maker except overpraise his misses?\n\nIt’s just one poll, but beneath it, broader tectonic shifts can be detected. If a director who was repeatedly slighted by the academy during his lifetime is today the most acclaimed and certainly the most watched director of classical Hollywood, it may well be because modern Hollywood has largely rebuilt itself in his image. Back in 1976, when Hitch’s last film, “Family Plot,” was dragging itself from theater to theater in search of an audience, his virtues — string-of-pearl set-piece construction, perpetual-motion plots, coupled with a healthy disrespect for American landmarks — seemed as cobwebbed as Norman Bates’s ma. “Jaws” had come out the year before. “Young Spielberg,” Hitchcock said after seeing Steven Spielberg’s perversely gleeful frightener, “is the first one of us who doesn’t see the proscenium arch.” Nowadays, nobody does. If Christopher Nolan’s “Inception” is our “Spellbound,” and David Fincher’s “Zodiac” our “Psycho,” then every other summer blockbuster aspires to the state of acute, hummingbird Zen first reached in “North by Northwest,” a thriller about nothing except the curious delight of going nowhere fast.\n\nSince his death in 1980, books have multiplied like gravestones, now numbering in the hundreds, with his biographers falling into two camps. There are those who side with Donald Spoto in “The Dark Side of Genius” (1983), who had him pegged as a troubled man whose deepest creative energies were coupled with fear, lust, sadism and a thoroughly unwholesome interest in his actresses — a creep with a movie camera. More recently, Patrick McGilligan’s “Alfred Hitchcock: A Life in Darkness and Light” suggested a corrective to Spoto’s damp-palmed portrayal: Exhaustively researched, bursting with Hollywood lore, that book showed us Hitchcock the ebullient, industrious craftsman — pleasuring the audience like a gigolo.\n\nHitchcock liked doubles and doppelgängers, so we should know how this turns out. The two portraits are in fact — shock! horror! — the same man, “a shuddering, shivering human being,” in the words of his new biographer, Peter Ackroyd, “beaming amid his nightmares,” in the even better words of the screenwriter Ben Hecht, giving off “plot turns like a Roman candle.” A man of “exaggeratedly delicate sensibilities,” according to John Houseman, driven by fear, guilt and loathing of his own body, yet dainty to the point of effeminacy in his gestures and attitudes, wielding his bulk with the grace of Fatty Arbuckle. “Never ruffled, never gave any sign of being worried, never shouted, was always in control,” Karl Malden said of working with the director on “I Confess.” Perhaps the best comment, though, comes from the producer David Selznick, who repeatedly tussled with Hitchcock for control of “Rebecca”: “Not exactly a man to go camping with.”"
