        "text": "At the grand age of 60 this film remains a masterpiece of intrigue and double-dealing; from the opening modernist title credits and cameo appearance of Hitchcock to the iconic chase scene where a solitary Cary Grant is hunted down by a murderous crop-duster aeroplane.\n\nEva Marie Saint was happily married with two young children when Hitchcock cast her as his latest blond muse. His choice of female star came as a surprise as she was known for being a method-trained actress who was more usually to be found as a downtrodden, drab housewife. Far removed from being a sex symbol. In fact Hitchcock joked with her about the role: “You don’t cry in this one. There’s no sink.”\n\nHe had hoped to lure Grace Kelly back to Hollywood for the part, but when that failed he put all his efforts into transforming Eva Marie Saint into the alluring woman described in his script. He supervised everything from her hairstyle to make-up and wardrobe. He also advised her to lower her voice, keep her hands still and to look Cary Grant in the eyes when talking to him.\n\nThe result was a fine nuanced performance of a conflicted double agent and it surprised many critics who were more used to seeing her playing shy, dowdy characters rather than a teasing, subtle seductress. Hitchcock even went shopping with his leading lady at the exclusive Bergdorf Goodman in New York, where they viewed a parade of models and selected the outfits he wanted her to wear.\n\nTime for a hit\n\nFollowing disappointing box-office returns for The Wrong Man (1956) and Vertigo (1958), North by Northwest (1959) was a return to classic Hitchcock.\n\nThe mix of suspense, adventure and romance involving an innocent man pursued by both criminals and the police had all the finest ingredients for a hit movie. And with Cary Grant at the helm the film oozed class and effortless Fifties’ style.\n\nThe male lead had appealed to another Hitchcock favourite, James Stewart, who had already appeared in four films from the famous director. But while Hitch loved him, he didn't think he was right for the debonair Roger Thornhill. He wanted Cary Grant for the part but did not want to hurt Stewart's feelings. Hitchcock opted to wait until Stewart was contracted to another film (Bell, Book and Candle) before casting the role.\n\nFinancial acumen\n\nGrant accepted the role and, being financially astute, did very well out of it when filming over ran its shooting schedule. He was paid an additional $5,000 per day (around $41,000 today) for the production running over – and it ran 78 days over schedule.\n\nBut the star found the screenplay baffling, and midway through filming told Hitchcock:\"It's a terrible script. We've already done a third of the picture and I still can't make head or tail of it!” Hitchcock believed this confusion would only help the film as Grant's character had no idea what was going on either.\n\nThe sexy flirting on the train between Grant and Saint is one of the highlights of the film and references a similar scene from The 39 Steps, but with different outcomes. Instead of being rejected by the woman as Hannay was in the earlier film, Thornhill is protected by Eve. Although this does turn out to be duplicitous.\n\nYou wouldn't expect Hitchcock to have to sneak around, but even the Master of Suspense was no match for the United Nations, which did not allow filming at its New York headquarters, not even in the plaza outside. So to get the shot where Grant walks into the building in search of his kidnapper, Hitchcock hid a camera in a nondescript truck and filmed in secret from across the street."
