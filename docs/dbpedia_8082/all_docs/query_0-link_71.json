        "text": "New Restoration\n\n“Epitomizes the whole of [Hitchcock’s] work in America.”\n\nFrançois Truffaut\n\nAt once a monumental thriller and a light comedy, North by Northwest, Hitchcock’s follow-up to Vertigo, marked his final collaboration with Cary Grant. Grant plays all-surface ad-man Roger Thornhill, who meets his shadow in George Kaplan, the spy name he’s mistakenly matched with. Or is it a mistake? As critic Robin Wood has pointed out, while North by Northwest bears similarities to earlier Hitchcocks like The 39 Steps and Saboteur, here the peril isn’t just a matter of an external diabolical plot, but is presented—in glorious VistaVision!—as matters internal to Thornhill, every set-piece an outcropping of his personality. Eva Marie Saint, James Mason, and Martin Landau make indelible appearances, while the script by Ernest Lehman (Sweet Smell of Success) is perfectly insidious—jokes, threats, and innuendo form a seamless relationship. This brand-new restoration is presented following its premiere at the TCM Film Festival.\n\nNorth by Northwest will be preceded by a video introduction by Turner Classic Movies’s Ben Mankiewicz."
