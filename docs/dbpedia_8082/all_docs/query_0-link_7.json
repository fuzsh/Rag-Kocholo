        "text": "ABOUT THE FILM:\n\nCary Grant stars as an innocent man mistaken for a spy in one of director Alfred Hitchcock’s greatest thrillers. While leaving New York’s Plaza Hotel, advertising executive Roger Thornhill (Grant) has the misfortune of standing just as the name “George Kaplan” is paged–starting a lethal case of mistaken identity and a nonstop game of cat and mouse as he is pursued across North America by espionage agents trying to kill him–and by police who suspect him of murder.\n\nFORMAT: 70mm\n\nDISTRIBUTOR: WARNER BROS.\n\nCOUNTRY: USA\n\nNORTH BY NORTHWEST (1959) was filmed in VistaVision and released in 1.85. Motion Picture Imaging scanned the original 8 per 35mm VistaVision camera negative in 13k with all restoration work completed in 6.5k. The 70mm film print was created by filming out a new 65mm negative. The 5.1 audio mix was created from the original mono stems. The Film Foundation has given approval of the restoration."
