        "text": "â€˜NORTH BY NORTHWESTâ€™\n\nPlease feel free to comment on my review.\n\nDestination Hitchcock\n\nâ€˜The Master of Suspense weaves his Greatest Tale!â€™\n\nAlfred Hitchcock is regarded as one of the most highly regarded film directors of his time in the 20th century. Better known as â€˜the Master of Suspenseâ€™, Hitchcock directed films such as â€˜Vertigoâ€™, â€˜The Man Who Knew Too Muchâ€™ (two versions), â€˜Rear Windowâ€™ and his most famous film of allâ€¦â€˜Psychoâ€™!\n\nI was introduced to Alfred Hitchcockâ€™s films by my parents as a kid. Yeah, I know. A kid watching Hitchcock films?! ðŸ˜® Nevertheless, I saw them and enjoyed them. I have my personal favourites from Hitchcockâ€™s line of films and one of them happens to be â€˜North by Northwestâ€™. Itâ€™s one superb movie!\n\nâ€˜North by Northwestâ€™ stars Cary Grant as Roger Thornhill, a man who gets kidnapped for being a spy and is soon on the run by the police for being a â€˜wantedâ€™ man. He eventually meets Eva Marie Saint as Eve Kendal, who he falls in love with and they work together to stop the menace of James Mason.\n\nJames Mason stars as Phillip Vandamm, who may be suspected for stealing government secrets. He and his accomplice Martin Landau as Leonard mistake Roger Thornhill for being a man called â€˜George Kaplanâ€™, to which Thornhill categorically denies. They donâ€™t believe him in spite of his claims.\n\nI was pretty engrossed in the film from watching it as a kid. I liked how things unravelled themselves in terms of what the mystery was about and why Roger Thornhill was mysteriously mistaken for being â€˜George Kaplanâ€™. Iâ€™ve seen this film for the umpteenth time to know whatâ€™s coming next here.\n\nI probably didnâ€™t understand what was going the first time being a kid, but nevertheless the film held my attention throughout. â€˜North by Northwestâ€™ is cited as being a Hitchcock classic and was claimed to be â€˜the Hitchcock picture to end all Hitchcock picturesâ€™. That isâ€¦until he did â€˜Psychoâ€™ of course. ðŸ˜€\n\nIn fact, it was the screenwriter Ernest Lehman who wanted to write this film as â€˜the Hitchcock picture to end all Hitchcock picturesâ€™. Iâ€™m not sure why he wanted to do that considering Hitchcock was in high demand at the time. Hitchcock is well-known for making a cameo in every film he makes.\n\nHitchcock was like the Stan Lee of his day in doing a cameo in every film he directs. For this film, he is seen trying to get on a bus before the door slams in his face. This happens as his directorâ€™s credit appears on the screen. Itâ€™s funny to see that after the opening credits as I watch this film every time.\n\nCary Grant is the star of the movie as Roger Thornhill. Usually in Hitchcock films, James Stewart would be cast in the main leading role. In fact, James Stewart was considered for the role of Roger Thornhill in this. I donâ€™t think James Stewart would be as superb as Cary Grant is for this specific film.\n\nI like how Cary Grant plays the ordinary man who is bemused by whatâ€™s going on with being kidnapped; getting forcibly drunk and almost killed by enemy agents. Roger Thornhill becomes increasingly curious about whatâ€™s going on, without knowing that danger is around the next corner.\n\nEva Marie Saint stars the leading lady of the film. Eve Kendal is a very attractive blonde-haired lady who Roger Thornhill gradually discovers is a spy working for a secret organisation. They meet on a train and instantly fall in love. Yeah. Even they admit that itâ€™s ridiculous them falling in love in an instant.\n\nIt was interesting and tense as Roger Thornhill makes the assumption Eve Kendal is working with Philip Vandamm, feeling betrayed. But thereâ€™s a lot more to it than that. I became anxious when Eve Kendal shot with him a gun in a cafe at Mount Rushmore. But did she really kill Roger Thornhill here?\n\nJames Mason stars as the villain of the film, Philip Vandamm. Heâ€™s a mysterious character indeed here. Upon first meeting him, Thornhill assumes heâ€™s a â€˜Mr. Lester Townsendâ€™ who lives in a big country house once heâ€™s abducted there. But as the mystery unfolds, it turns out not to be the case.\n\nItâ€™s not made clear why Vandamm wants government secrets and why he would assume Roger Thornhill would be this â€˜George Kaplanâ€™ person. Heâ€™s very attracted to Eve Kendal who becomes his girlfriend in this. But once he realises sheâ€™s betrayed him, will he be allowed to live once on a plane?\n\nMartin Landau stars as Leonard, Vandammâ€™s confidante and friend in the film. Martin Landau is well-known for starring in TV shows such as â€˜Mission: Impossibleâ€™ and â€˜Space: 1999â€™. Itâ€™s interesting how Leonardâ€™s character is revealed with this hint of homosexuality especially before Vandamm and Eve.\n\nThe film also features Jessie Royce Landis as Clara Thornhill, Rogerâ€™s mother. I did find Rogerâ€™s mother was unsupportive of his sonâ€™s claims to being forcibly drunk and almost killed by evil men. She finds it absurd. I know sheâ€™s meant to be comic relief, but couldnâ€™t she be more caring than that?\n\nThereâ€™s also Leo G. Carroll as the Professor whoâ€™s in charge of a secret organisation working to expose Vandammâ€™s criminal activities. Apparently, Leo G. Carroll has been in many Hitchcock films and he would later go on to be in â€˜The Man From U.N.C.L.E.â€™ TV series. Heâ€™s very good in this movie.\n\nThe film also features Josephine Hutchinson as â€˜Mrs. Townsendâ€™, who is actually fake and really Vandammâ€™s sister and thereâ€™s Philip Ober as the â€˜realâ€™ Lester Townsend. Thereâ€™s also Edward Platt, who is well-known for playing the Chief of Control in â€˜Get Smartâ€™, as Victor Larrabee, Rogerâ€™s lawyer.\n\nThereâ€™s also Adam Williams as Valerian and Robert Ellenstein as Licht, Vandammâ€™s henchmen who kidnap Roger Thornhill early on in the film. Thereâ€™s also Les Tremayne as the auctioneer who gets frustrated by Roger Thornhill disrupting the auction taking place as he makes very confusing bets. ðŸ˜€\n\nThe film is very well-written by Ernest Lehman, who provides plenty of tension and drama in this action-packed thriller. As well as the impressive plane attack sequence in the crop fields on Roger Thornhill, thereâ€™s the iconic Mount Rushmore scene where Thornhill and Eve Kendal are escaping. ðŸ˜€\n\nThereâ€™s also an impressive musical score provided by Bernard Herrmann. The music for the filmâ€™s opening credits is memorable. Itâ€™s often the signature piece for some tense and dramatic moments. This includes moments where Roger Thornhill is escaping danger and avoiding capture by the police.\n\nThe DVD special features are as follows. Thereâ€™s a â€˜Cast & Crewâ€™ list; an audio commentary by screenwriter Ernest Lehman; the behind-the-scenes documentary â€˜Destination: Hitchcock: The Making of North by Northwestâ€™, hosted by Eva Maria Saint and a theatrical trailer. Thereâ€™s also a stills gallery; a music only audio track by Bernard Herrmann and a TV commercial.\n\nâ€˜North by Northwestâ€™ is definitely one of the best Alfred Hitchcock films ever made from 1959. Itâ€™s one of my favourites from â€˜the Master of Suspenseâ€™. Itâ€™s rated very highly by critics. The film comes highly recommended with such brilliant cast performances; directing; writing; action and music score.\n\nCary Grant, Eva Marie Saint and James Mason excel in the film. Itâ€™s amazing to look back on this film with fond childhood memories. It still impresses me to this very day and itâ€™s one of these films that shouldnâ€™t be forgotten. Iâ€™m pretty sure that it wonâ€™t be the case since Hitchcockâ€™s films are the best!\n\nâ€˜North by Northwestâ€™ rating â€“ 9/10"
