A masterclass of concise writing, too – there’s nothing here that could be shaved off to make the film any better.” Jacob Stolworthy\n\n“Cary Grant is at his urbane best in a tale that effortlessly blends menace with romance and sly humour.” James Healy\n\nLists\n\nHappy 100th birthday to Eva Marie Saint: 5 essential films\n\nBy David Parkinson\n\nHappy 100th birthday to Eva Marie Saint: 5 essential films\n\nThe Greatest Films of All Time\n\nThe Greatest Films of All Time\n\nThe Greatest Films of All Time\n\n10 great\n\n10 great spy films\n\nBy Matthew Thrift\n\n10 great spy films"
