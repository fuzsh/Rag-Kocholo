        "text": "There is no terror in the bang, only in the anticipation of it.\n\nWhen I first started getting interested in films, Alfred Hitchcock was really the first directer I started looking into. I don’t really know why, other than he’s just such a big icon I guess. Whatever the reason, I have come to love his films. I’ve seen nearly half of them at this point. Hitchcock is in strong contention for my favorite director of all time; the only person I can really see giving him a run for his money is Martin Scorsese, but that’s a discussion for another day.\n\nThough I’m still working through Hitch’s filmography, I have reviewed most of the film I’ve seen pre-blog as part of my Hitchcock marathon that ran from the middle of December ’12 to January ’13. Since then, I seem to be stuck on doing Hitchcock in marathon form, so I have a lot of announcement and wrap up posts, way more than usual.\n\nIf you feel like talking Hitchcock, leave a comment below!\n\nRankings and Other Assorted Posts:\n\nAlfred Hitchcock Day 2013\n\nThe Hitchcock Marathon: Phase One Wrap Up\n\nGood Evening.
