        "text": "Back in 1958, when they were working on “North by Northwest,” Alfred Hitchcock told screenwriter Ernest Lehman that they weren’t making a movie. Instead, he explained, “We’re constructing an organ ... and we press this chord, and now the audience laughs; we press that chord, and they gasp, and we press these notes and they chuckle.”\n\nHitchcock was only partly right. Yes, “North by Northwest” manipulates its audience flawlessly, coaxing laughs, gasps and chuckles just like the master planned. But it’s not just an audience-response generator — it’s a truly great movie, exhibiting the sort of precision and craft you don’t see much anymore.\n\nAnd, on the just-released Blu-ray, it looks better than it ever has on home video. In fact, once you pop this into your player, you’ll be seeing virtually the same image audiences saw in theaters in 1959.\n\nThe premise of “North by Northwest” is simple but offers virtually endless possibilities: Ultra-smooth ad man Roger O. Thornhill (Cary Grant, pretty smooth himself) flags down a bellboy paging a “Mr. George Kaplan.” Thornhill just wants to send a telegram, but it turns out Kaplan is a secret agent, and now the badguys think Thornhill is he. From there, “North by Northwest” takes a wild cross-country trip, from the United Nations building to Chicago to Mount\n\nRushmore, with a memorable pit-stop involving a cornfield, a crop duster and a gasoline truck.\n\nThough James Stewart was considered for Thornhill, Grant is perfect for the role, bringing his trademark wit and unflappable charm. He’s in mortal peril for most of the movie, but he reacts to everything like it’s just another minor annoyance in the life of Roger O. Thornhill. He makes running for your life look like a rousing romp, and by the end of the film, you’re wishing you could be him — and not just because he winds up with Eva Marie Saint.\n\nBesides the movie, the new “North by Northwest” Blu-ray includes a commentary track from Lehman, a making-of feature hosted by Saint, a documentary examining Hitchcock’s style and another doc telling Grant’s life story. And, as if that weren’t enough, there are trailers, stills, commercials and other promotional materials. But the real star here is the movie. Not only is it great — one of Hitchcock’s best, and probably his most purely fun — but it looks downright amazing. Everything just leaps off the screen.\n\nIf you just got a Blu-ray player or you’re planning to get one for Christmas, I can’t think of a better disc than this one to give it a test drive.\n\nFrom the Vault: Four favorites from the master of suspense\n\nIf “North by Northwest” whets your appetite for Hitchcock, here are a few more suspenseful suggestions:\n\n“Shadow of a Doubt” (1943): Hitchcock claimed it was his favorite film, and it’s easy to see why. The all-American small-town vibe contrasts perfectly with Joseph Cotten’s devilish turn as a serial killer.\n\n“Psycho” (1960): Hitch’s follow-up to “North by Northwest” changed movies forever with its combination of sex and violence in one notorious shower scene.\n\n“Saboteur” (1942): It’s not as polished as “North by Northwest,” but this cross-country chase has its moments, including a startling finale atop the Statue of Liberty.\n\n“Rear Window” (1954): Jimmy Stewart thinks he’s seen a murder, and Grace Kelly helps him investigate. Trivia note: The songwriting neighbor is Ross Bagdasarian, who created “Alvin and the Chipmunks.”\n\nIntroducing ‘Fire at Will’\n\nHave a movie question you’re dying to get answered? Did you catch a glimpse of some film late at night and now, in the cold light of morning, you have no idea what it is? Need a recommendation for a special night of viewing? My new feature, “Fire at Will,” is here to help.\n\nSend your movie questions — whatever they may be — to me, Movie Man Will Pfeifer, at wpfeifer@rrstar.com. Put “Fire at Will” in the subject line, and I’ll do my best to find and answer and share it in this column. Please include your full name, city and daytime phone number (which isn’t for publication)."
