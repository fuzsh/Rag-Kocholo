        "text": "This is one of the only two films that Alfred Hitchcock wished he had made. Claude Chabrol was known as the \"French Hitchcock,\" and \"Le Boucher\" was considered by many to be his masterpiece. This is a sort of Hitchcock style is he / isn't he a serial killer - thriller set in the stunning Perigord area of France.\n\nThey're several Hitchcockian themes in the film that keep repeating throughout its story. Smoking is one of the major themes that gets brought up again and again, and interestingly enough we never see Popaul smoking unless Helene decides to light up. Another Hitchcockian visual look is of the protoganist that plays Miss Helene. She is played by actress St√©phane Audranis who married the director Claude Chabrol in 1964, after a short marriage to the French actor Jean-Louis Trintignant. Her blond hair, is purposely shown many times from behind, one particular moment the camera actually zooms in, as she presents a look very similar to Hitchcock's actress Tippi Hedren. The way Popaul admires and watches Helene can be a similar parallel to the way director Hitchcock obsessed and molded his particular actresses that he worked with throughout his career. Another theme is Popaul's face admiring Helene, always watching her, most famously his face being seen in the frame of the classroom window. The first time that scene occurs it is looked at as slightly childish and humorous, the second time near the conclusion of the film, it gives off a voyeuristic and disturbing feel. Church bells ringing are another theme that is repeatedly heard throughout the soundtrack of the film, which can look at as a metaphor of time slowly running out between the two fatal characters.\n\nIt's regrettable that Hitchcock and Bogart, two icons on their respective fields and of the same generation (they were born the same year), never collaborated. Was Hitchcock too protective of his aura not to let Bogie steal his thunder, or was the opposite? I do believe that a Hitch-and-Bogie movie wouldn't have been as inconceivable as having John Wayne in a musical, for there is at least one Bogart movie that proves me right, a film with something Hitchcockian about his character, Vincent Parry, whose face is only revealed at the third act, but I'll get to that later.\n\nYes indeed, \"Dark Passage\" is either full of reminiscences or premonitions of what would become Hitch's instantly recognizable trademarks, plot and style-wise. It's a paranoid thriller enrobed with a restrained romance finally blooming when approaching the finale, it's a suspenseful drama where everyone is a suspect from the mind of the wrongly suspected one, it's a tale of false identities and real assassins, it's one of the most memorable movies set in San Francisco and it's the third starring the legendary Bogart and Bacall duo. Yet, for once, the fascination doesn't rely on their undeniable chemistry (that mostly showed through Howard Hawks' movies) but on these little details that will remind you of Hitch's classic, so let's start the count.\n\n1/ THE WRONG MAN / SUSPICION / NORTH BY NORTHWEST: The false identity or the wrongly accused man is a common source of thrills in Hitch movies: a generally harmless man taken for a dangerous criminal, especially when every friend he visits meets with an unfortunate accident‚Ä¶ that's a premise, banal to say the least, but it gets spiced up when the hero's only way to prove his innocence is risking his life and dirtying his hands. In \"Dark Passage\", Parry said farewell to Irene (Bacall) but his honor forces him to come back when her life's threatened by a blackmailer, just like in \"North by Northwest\" when Thornhill is free but learns that Eve is still in danger. There's always the moment where the protagonists turn from passive to heroic, many Bogart characters show their nobility at the end of the film, like many Hitchcock heroes‚Ä¶ in other words, they're late-bloomers.\n\n2/ PSYCHO : The film was released with the Red Scare as political backdrop, it failed at the box-office after Bogart and Bacall retracted their protest actions and ended up testifying before the HUAC, but it's nonetheless a film of its era : dark, suspicious and paranoid. On that last aspect, \"Dark Passgae\" is a showcase of how paranoia can be conveyed by good writing and film-making, like Marion Crane, after she stole the money in \"Psycho\", every encounter is startling and unsettling, the less she wants to talk, the more talkative people get, the less suspicious she tries not to, the more she looks, exactly what Vincent goes through during the film. A man asking for a match, a cab driver too much questions, leading him to a plastic surgeon, but it could've been a police office as well ‚Ä¶ and speaking of cops, the dialog where a new-faced Vincent tries to outsmart a detective is pure example of verbal suspense. Action is an easy catalysis for thrills but to make it through dialogs is pure virtuosity.\n\n3/ VERTIGO: Perhaps after \"Vertigo\", this is the only film where I saw relevance for it being set in San Francisco (not just for a car chase scene). The local touch is significant to the plot; not just some screenplay blank filler, like the scene where an exhausted Vincent climbs the interminable stairs to go to Irene's house on the highest side of that bumpy town, or how about his fist-fight near the Golden Gate. While it's easily forgettable that \"Maltese Falcon\" was set in San Francisco, it's rather impossible with \"Dark Passage\".\n\n4/ REAR WINDOW / VERTIGO : The fall of Madge (Agnes Moorehead) out of the window looks exactly like Jeff's fall at the climax of \"Rear Window\" and it's more convincing, too, but it's also closer to those from \"Vertigo\" ... with the obligatory shrill female scream, naturally.\n\n5/ SPELLBOUND : And lastly, there's this brilliant piece of surrealism during the face transformation sequence, working like an original and creatively designed parenthesis and a great transition between the first third of the film (subjective camera) and the second (Bogart's face covered with bandages), a sort of kaleidoscope of all the characters confusingly interacting in Vincent's mind‚Ä¶ who's with him? who's against him? This is not Dali with his eyes and scissors, but it's mesmerizing nonetheless. Isn't the mark of a great movie to blow your mind, just when you think you had enough‚Ä¶ with the long overuse of the subjective camera?\n\nSpeaking of the subjective camera, isn't that something to have one third of the film without showing Bogart's face (for obvious reasons) and the second third in bandages. That's the kind of audience-fooling, tricks Hitch loved to do, he who deprived his audience from Marion Carne all through \"Psycho\" second half, Delmer Daves deprives us from Bogie's face all through the first (and more) but we don't lose much since the film is rich in great supporting performances notably, from Houseley Stevenson as the wacky (in a spooky way) mad-scientist, to Agnes Moorehead whose interplays with Bogart almost overshadowed the romantic interludes with Bacall.\n\nEspecially the surgery scene is quite demented. Bogie goes under the knife and sees (or imagines) multiple dissolves and triple exposures of the odd doctor, with a distant Bacall at the center. Its a nightmarish sequence, something out of Hitchcock.\n\nFrom one superstar to the other. Who doesn't want to see Marilyn Monroe in a Hitchcock Movie? Well, this is the best one could get.\n\nVertigo is one Hitchcock movie that has influenced dozens of other movies. But what if someone told you it had a huge influence of NIagara on itself! Many people will, no doubt, experience a certain sense of deja vu as they watch some passages in this movie as it contains a number of similarities to Alfred Hitchcock's \"Vertigo\". The most striking ones are the presence of a blonde femme fatale, an obsessed male, the significance of bell towers to the plots and the prominent use of some very memorable location shots. The positions in which the dead bodies in the bell towers lie is also virtually identical. The fact that \"Niagara\" predated \"Vertigo\" by some years, leads to the view that Hitchcock must have been profoundly influenced by many of the elements of Hathaway's movie.\n\nIf there is any noir film that holds it noir gloom even though shot largely in daylight, not in a city, and in vivid color, Niagara is it. There are a handful of color noir films, not including some from the 1970s and later that get swept into the category in an expansive but not always helpful way (Chinatown, for one). But this is the real deal, and it's not a perfect film by any means, but it's also a neglected movie, valuable for it's unique feel, for the terrific night scenes it does have, and for the Niagara Falls, which Hitchcock was probably jealous of. There are lots of Hitchcock parallels--famous landmark for a setting, stereotypes played both ways, calm before the disaster, undisguised back projection and its confession of open artifice, innocents caught in a murderous world--but it it's better to see what this movie has on its own terms.\n\nOne thing Niagara has is Marilyn Monroe playing Rose Loomis. Monroe the actress is forced (or reinforced) into her recurring role as helpless siren, but she also shows off as the actress she always was, not brilliant, but very effective and smart. The disdain she has in a momentary sneer as she rolls over the second time in bed in her first scene is the first of a thousand good examples--listen to her in the shower backlit, or watch her at the souvenir shop, or on the phone. With a number of adjustments, her role here could have created a paradigm for the two-faced femme-fatale in the 1950s Hitchcock Movies--her coy chill, her thinly disguised greed, her human failings. We never mind sympathizing with a criminal when she is going down at the end if she has earlier shown her complexity and vulnerability.\n\nWhen I have recently viewed this wonderful film noir, I felt it was the right time because I had already got to know the greatest films of the genre, not superior ones but similar ones. What I mean by that are the films directed by the master of suspense, Alfred Hitchcock. When seeing SUDDEN FEAR, you had better be acquainted with some of Hitchcock's best films because then, you may realize that SUDDEN FEAR has so much in common with the gem of noir. It's Hitchcock's fertile theme and Miller's stylish bravura. From the characters, objects, undertones, certain details, doom-filled atmosphere to the unique charm of San Francisco and the utterance that seems to be the core of Hitchcock's suspense: \"This place is so perfect for an accident.\" Let me broaden some aspects of David Miller's picture which make us see it as one of the greatest representatives of its genre in the purest form.\n\nThe TORMENTED LEADING CHARACTER, Myra Hudson played brilliantly by Joan Crawford, highlights something truly ahead of its time. As an executive producer of SUDDEN FEAR, Ms Crawford allows viewers to get into her inner psyche and provokes a progressive approach: we psychoanalyze her as a character! Nothing like a linear storytelling, forget it! Yet, something that talks about a psychological world. We psychoanalyze her 'professional eye' in the theater scene, her coldness melted on a train at the match game that becomes as mysterious as the manipulative flirts, her 'blind confidence' in wedding Lester, the seeds of doubt that are being slowly planted from the moment he does not answer her phone. As a matter of fact, this is a purely genius scene when viewers-observers, unlike Myra herself, are granted a signal: \"something is wrong about him.\" As a result, we differ from Myra, we feel suspicion earlier than her and, consequently, wait for her disillusion. When the unbelievable shock comes in her library and she confronts the reality, her behavior is utterly unpredictable: she does not resort to a state of blending fantasy with reality but remains cold and disguised both to us and to the people around her. In that respect, isn't she a typical Hitchcock's leading lady? Apart from one difference - she is not a blonde. Nominated for Oscar, Joan Crawford offers us a pure masterwork of acting.\n\nJACK PALANCE, who replaces Ms Crawford's initial wish of casting Marlon Brando or Clark Gable, is truly surprising as a leading man. The fact we are not used to him in such a highlighted performance that combines a doe-eyed romanticist with a secret fox makes the effect even more memorable. An important fact here to state is that Lester is equally appealing in the psychoanalyzing approach as Myra. His pretense at the beginning, his patronizing behavior on the train, his look at hands, and his gradual 'promotion' in Myra's eyes beautifully depict an ambitious type. Later, his vitality and efforts are, somehow, focused on two women: Myra and Irene. When Myra begins to be his object of wealth's desire, Irene becomes his object of lust's desire. She is a 'blonde of lust.' Their scheme is a realization of their sexuality - something very Hitchcock-like where crime goes with sex. \"Kiss me hard...\" Note the love scene at the fireplace in the summerhouse and the way it is shot. Oscar nominated for Best Supporting Actor, Jack Palance appears to give a performance beyond our expectations.\n\nWritten by \"Charade\" writer Peter Stone, this movie will keep you testing on \"What is going on\" theories till the end. The Story goes like: When a man calls the police to report his wife missing, nobody is overly concerned. Even when a reluctant Inspector Levine (Jack Klugman) finally drives out to get Daniel Corban's (James Franciscus) statement about how his wife drove off after an argument and hasn't returned since, Levine still maintains that Corban shouldn't worry, she'll probably reappear soon enough. And he appears to be proved right when the local priest, Father Kelleher (Joel Fabiani) visits Corban and tells him his wife wants to come back - but as soon as Elizabeth (Elizabeth Ashley) walks through the door, Corban insists that this woman is NOT his wife! And that's just the very beginning of the movie.\n\nNow Corban tries to prove to Levine and Kelleher that the woman is an impostor, while Elizabeth tries to convince them that her husband is disturbed and potentially in need of psychiatric help. It is up to Levine to find out the truth.\n\nThe mystery is extremely well crafted and full of plot twists, until the viewer can no longer be sure as to who is doing what to whom and why. At the same time, it has a great sense of humor, exploring the absurdly comical side of the situation as well as the mystery. Especially Levine has a lot of funny lines, and it is hilarious to watch the couple arguing over whether she is or isn't his wife in front of a rather puzzled-looking Kelleher and Levine as spectators to the domestic drama.\n\nAdapted from a stage play, the teleplay is excellent. The casting is great, and so is the acting. A true masterpiece of hitchcockian elements. If you get a chance, you should definitely watch it! Every once in a while you might catch it on TV. It's around on VHS, and it's also on youtube.\n\nCritic Rex Reed huffed and puffed that ‚ÄúIf Hitchcock could only laugh at himself, this is the movie he‚Äôd make.‚Äù\n\nThis is the Second Audrey Hepburn movie on the List. Let me remind you, audrey never worked with Hitchcock, so this and Charade are the closest you'll get to see her in a Hitchcock movie..\n\n\"The best Hitchcock film that Hitchcock never made\". It think that is very true. Most of the film is shot within this basement apartment unit. And the thriller is so great because of Hepburn being blind and these three bad guys freely walking into her unit and introducing themselves as her husband's friends, or police, or some neighbour. But they all forget one thing: She uses her ears like no regular person does, she doesn't need eyes. But that is where the thriller kicks in. Sometimes it is pretty painful for us to watch (us who can see) because she seems so vulnerable. Wrapping around of all this is Henry Mancini's music. He is using a technique that he also used in the film \"Night Visitor\" where there is this melody on the keyboard and after everynote there is the detuned note following it. Pretty cool effect.\n\nThese slow, intricate developments are fascinating to watch but most importantly, lead to a climatic ending reaching Hitchcock levels of suspense. As the title of the film suggests, you really have to wait until dark to fully appreciate how well made this film is.\n\nThe fact is, that this could so very easily have become a very mediocre 'stage play to film' adaptation. What makes it that little bit special is very hard to pinpoint. Perhaps it's because it's NOT a Hitchcock, but could so very easily have been. One can only ponder how the master of suspense himself could have improved this gem of film?\n\n4 Major Points that literally shouts of Hitchcock influence are :-\n\nFirst, we have the doll. This is a classic \"MacGuffin\" in the Hitchcock tradition. A MacGuffin is an object on which the plot hangs, which drives the characters' actions. It could be anything -- a box of chocolates with diamonds inside, a slip of paper with incriminating evidence -- it doesn't matter what the item is that pushes the story along, and indeed we don't know what the doll contains until the last couple of reels -- precisely because it is inconsequential to the workings of the film.\n\nSecond, we have the central suspense-building technique of the film, which is that the audience knows what is going on while the protagonist does not. The blindness of the central character affords wide latitude in exploiting this idea. It is a technique often used by Hitch to manipulate the audience, memorably for example in Sabotage and Rope, to name only two. It works here to great effect.\n\nThird, there is really only one \"jump out and say boo!\" moment in the movie and it is extraordinarily well-timed. After the suspense has been built to a fever pitch and artificially deflated there is an almost cathartic moment of leap-out-of-your-seat-and-scream shock before the last suspenseful moments. Compare it to Psycho, for example, and the final moments in the basement in that picture -- a similar effect on the audience.\n\nFourth, the criminals' plot is a little too involved to be realistic. But like the doll it exists only to produce suspense in the audience. On this level it richly succeeds. Hitchcock by and large dismissed credibility as key to a plot (read Hitchcock/Truffaut for many interesting thoughts on this). If the film is to engage the suspense of the audience on a cinematic level, to such an extent that they suspend their disbelief, the plot's purpose is to provide a framework in which this can occur. Again, the picture works on this level.\n\nFans of this will also like: \"Rear Window,\"(1954) \"Memento,\" (2000) and \"Vertigo\" (1958)."
