        "text": "Whoever Kaplan is, he’s\n\ngot nothing on Cary Grant\n\n“The Godfather” was released in 1972. At the time, Cary Grant was 68 years old — ideal, perhaps, for Vito. Is it possible to imagine Grant in the role of Don Corleone? No, not really. That wasn’t the Cary Grant brand, he likely was never seriously considered for it, and so the role went to Marlon Brando, only 48 around that time, giving Brando the upper hand in the argument as to who was the greatest film actor ever.\n\nThe standard-bearer of the Cary Grant brand is “North by Northwest,” a Hitchcock pairing that swerves wonderfully from adventure to comedy to suspense. But as the legend goes, Grant might not’ve been the first choice; Jimmy Stewart supposedly had the role until “Vertigo” proved to be a box-office clunker. According to anecdotes, even Grant was surprised at the popularity of “North by Northwest.” Taken literally, the plot is absurd. Somehow, Grant and Hitchcock make it buyable, producing some of Hollywood’s most famous scenes.\n\nThere is a curious little parallel with the 21st century version of the “Ocean’s 11” series helmed by George Clooney. The films want to remind us periodically that this isn’t so much Roger Thornhill or Danny Ocean, but Cary Grant and George Clooney. We’re watching the real thing more or less playing himself, under the very thin guise of a character. The “Ocean’s” movies might have been tired remakes, but something about “North by Northwest” is a triumphant tribute to the persona known as Cary Grant.\n\nGrant pretty much always played the hero, but in “North by Northwest” is introduced as not the most likable sort. He’s a fast-talking advertising executive who will scam someone out of a taxi. “In the world of advertising there’s no such thing as a lie — there’s only the expedient exaggeration,” he declares.\n\nLike many other Hitchcockian males, he has issues with his mother, and their relationship seems more like a business arrangement. When she agrees to obtain a room key in scurrilous fashion for $50, it should be alarmingly tacky, but instead is hilarious. Whatever his values, there is something likable about Roger Thornhill’s determination, defiance and cool. This is a guy who suddenly walks into one life-threatening situation after another yet is merely interested in making it home in time for a play.\n\nWe see how Roger Thornhill could be legitimately mistaken for Kaplan during a busy lunch. From that point on, we gladly suspend disbelief. The idea that bad guys could go to such lengths to commandeer a home of a VIP, then quickly undo it all, puts this film high up on the lengthy list of Overthinking Criminals. You would think, being such an efficient organization, they would want to verify the identity of “Kaplan” before wasting any of their time on him. And why would they take the time to stage a car accident rather than just push him over the cliff? It is almost criminality for the sake of being clever. But again, we don’t care, and the extremism is actually compelling. Someone has gone to such bizarre lengths to frame Roger Thornhill, we can’t help but wonder why.\n\nGrant’s roots were at least partly in comedy, and one wonders how funny he could’ve been if he ever let himself go. As Thornhill, he never flinches once, but gradually extends the character to the point we can believe what he does at the end. He is never afraid of the bad guys, just annoyed by them. He has to bungle his way out of his early troubles, but gets better and better at the art of spying and deception, dropping a funnier and funnier deadpan line each time. His best comes when he has made a mockery of an art auction, then while being dragged away declares, “I haven’t finished bidding yet!” And he does most of it in the same suit; an unflappable Madison Avenue guy.\n\nGeography is a big part of the film’s appeal. New York is an exciting place, and Hitchcock expertly taps into the hustle and bustle to get the film off the ground, much like Oliver Stone does in a much different movie, “Wall Street.” You see all kinds of people in suits, conducting business lunches in fine hotels, angling for cabs, briskly walking to their next appointment. And we’ll soon be taken to the U.N., site of many movie assassination plots, but none quite as striking as this one.\n\nFans of Grant and/or fans of Hitchcock have likely also seen “Notorious” and will easily note the similarities. The government is conducting espionage against the enemy du jour and is heartlessly using a non-professional young woman as its informant. In each film Grant plays the designated protector of the woman, but in “Northwest” he is merely an amateur himself. This is an appealing theme used in many other movies (let’s say, for this example, Karen Black in “Airport ’75” or Harrison Ford in “The Fugitive”), where an amateur is suddenly forced to become a real professional at something and quickly figures it out.\n\nAs in “Notorious,” Grant will question or doubt the government’s intentions and at some point accuse the woman of too readily agreeing to take part in the scheme. But “Notorious” is a celebration of great drama that happens to include great stars; “North by Northwest” is a celebration of Cary Grant that happens to be wrapped in appealing entertainment.\n\nHitchcock takes virtually every scene to its extremes, in particular the famous crop-dusting attack. Every year during the Oscars, the montage of great moments in motion pictures tends to include this snippet. Like the rest of the film, it is so bizarre, a ridiculously overplanned attack that allows for stunning visuals. But is it truly a perfect series of scenes? The bullets seem to fly well after the biplane has passed. This would be explained if the shooter was firing from the rear, although it would figure to be harder to see that way.\n\nThe opening credits reveal the movie was filmed in VistaVision. It produces a glossy, vibrant picture perfectly suited for the extreme depictions. There are people getting knifed at the U.N., people getting shot at from biplanes, people climbing the faces on Mount Rushmore. In black and white, it would almost seem a farce, but in vivid color, it is exciting and curious.\n\nAs the story goes, Eva Marie Saint was a replacement for Grace Kelly. She is perfunctory, adequate, but does not match the appeal of Bergman in “Notorious.” There is almost something a bit troubling about the courtship of Roger and Eve. She seems at times like she could be his daughter, odd for Grant, given his obsession with age-appropriate roles for himself. Their chemistry on the train is not great, although the scenes at Vandamm’s home make up for it.\n\nOne appealing element is the depiction of train service from a bygone era, the type that hasn’t existed for decades. Yes, there probably are luxury ways to travel on Amtrak, but certainly not with well-dressed porters, chefs, and mini bathrooms in the spacious cars. Unfortunately, the action in this movie tends to slow on the train, the Grant-Saint pairing unable to ignite the overly long scenes. The hide-and-seek game is predictable until disembarking, when Grant pulls a gotcha.\n\nAlso overly long is the daytime encounter between Grant and Saint near Rushmore, after the shooting. They should be in a much bigger hurry; there’s little emotional hook to their conversation. The action at Vandamm’s home is exhilarating, only to lead to another overly long stint on Rushmore. The ending is neatly done and involves a fine unexpected moment when Vandamm’s henchman appears that he will help; it just takes a few too many slippery rocks to get there.\n\nJames Mason, as Vandamm, is a decent villain, not a great one. As always, he has the voice. He has much in common with the Sebastian character in “Notorious,” being so clueless as to not know his lover was a spy. But Sebastian was a renegade Nazi; Vandamm is a businessman with apparent Soviet connections. This is the Sputnik, not WWII, era. It is harder to root against him or fear him than it should be.\n\nAccording to the famous American Film Institute 100 greatest films list, “North by Northwest” ranked 40th in 1998, then fell to 55th in the updated list a decade later. It figures to have endless staying power, with a quirky tone and a Hollywood giant that may forever go unmatched.\n\nShould it, though, be the pinnacle of Cary Grant? Critics lament that the highly trained actor who “pulled himself up from the bootstraps” would shun the most challenging, and potentially rewarding, roles someone of his status could easily acquire. From the late 1940s on, he saw himself as a suburban father type who could ring the box office register and please the fans with a routine script.\n\n“I offended him,” said one of his former wives (he had four, plus a widow), Betsy Drake, interviewed for a PBS documentary in 2004, “because I'd seen him in a picture called ‘The Bishop’s Wife,’ and I said to him, ‘You are in a position now where you can choose the most wonderful movies — why are you doing this?’ He never answered, because he was deeply offended.”\n\nGrant was said to joke about his own persona and didn’t shy away from his given name, Archibald Leach. Despite Cary Grant’s James Bond-esque panache, the real man was relatively unsophisticated. He worked to make a living, took his profession very seriously, and was not interested in trying ground-breaking or thought-provoking things, at least not if they risked altering his box office appeal. He was a poor child, who grew up knowing he had to work hard to make ends meet. This is an impressive life credential, but maybe constraining for a man whose unfathomable fame got well ahead of him and stayed there. He knew it, and likely didn’t want to somehow blow it, even at the long-term expense of selling himself short. That doesn’t disqualify him from conversations about the greatest film actor ever. In “North by Northwest,” he should have no regrets.\n\n4 stars\n\n(November 2008)\n\n“North by Northwest” (1959)\n\nStarring Cary Grant as Roger O.
