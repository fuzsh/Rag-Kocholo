        "text": "Along with the first flush of the liberal reforms that attended the collapse of the commune system, the classic feature films of the 1980s’ “fifth generation” were part of a widespread flowering of the arts, overturning the “socialist realism” of the Maoist era.\n\nAs with the other arts, while Chinese films and documentaries have continued to adapt (see e.g. Social issues in rural Hunan), it remains worth celebrating this early body of work—made just around the time when I was becoming familiar with folk music and ritual in village China, fostering my concern to consider wider social change. For more films (mainly documentaries) on Chinese ritual and rural life, see here.\n\nThere’s a wealth of academic and media coverage, but here I’ll make a little selection of some films—just the Usual Suspects, for those already in the know—that explore the lives of ordinary people (both rural and urban), including their folk music. Often set in the barren landscapes of rural Shaanbei and Shanxi, several of these works use amateur actors—always a good sign. Some are verité depictions of the early reform period itself, while others are set in the Maoist and pre-Liberation eras, but they were all important in helping revise our image of China. Of course, as fieldworkers we hope to document all three periods.\n\nA seminal film from the early days was\n\nYellow earth (Huang tudi 黄土地, Chen Kaige, 1984). Set in the Shaanbei base area during the War against Japan, exemplifies the travails of early CCP folk-song collectors (cf. Hequ 1953) as they were confronted by the poverty of rural China, and the vast cultural gulf separating them from the peasants they were seeking to rescue from “feudal superstition”. It’s framed by the opening wedding scene, and the final rain ritual:\n\nOld well (Laojing 老井, Wu Tianming, 1986, with Zhang Yimou) [1] is based on a poor village’s struggle against constant drought. One well-observed vignette (from 1.20.19) features a village story-telling session with blind musicians, and the peasants’ taste for “dirty songs” licensed by a token politically-correct speech (cf. Bards of Shaanbei, under “Old and new stories”):\n\nDespite the 1989 Tiananmen massacre, this wave persisted into the early 1990s. A timeless, mystical story of a rural blind bard in a stunning landscape is\n\nLife on a string (Bianzou bianchang 邊走邊唱, Chen Kaige, 1991):\n\nIn more verité style, filmed in rural and urban Shaanbei, is\n\nThe story of Qiu Ju (Qiu Ju da guansi 秋菊打官司, Zhang Yimou, 1992), surely Gong Li’s greatest and most uncharacteristic role as a sullen, aggrieved, confused peasant, a far cry from her standard fragrant image—with the street scenes particularly authentic, and a soundtrack punctuated by gutsy wanwanqiang singing by Li Shijie 李世傑 (sorry, no English subtitles here):\n\nAlso influential was Xie Jin’s 1986 film Hibiscus town (Furong zhen 芙蓉镇), set in Hunan:\n\nOn the insidious pressures of urban family life under Maoism, a most moving film is\n\nThe blue kite (Lan fengzheng 蓝风筝, Tian Zhuangzhuang, 1993):\n\n(For more on Tian Zhuangzhuang, click here.)\n\nAnd in similar vein,\n\nTo live (Huozhe 活着, Zhang Yimou, 1994), based on a novel by Yu Hua:\n\nIn these two films I find links with depictions of the lives of ordinary people under the GDR.\n\nAmong many films revising images of Tibet within the PRC (note Robbie Barnett’s chapter in Conflicting memories, and §4 of his Columbia course) is\n\nThe horse thief (Daoma zei 盗马贼, Tian Zhuangzhuang, 1986):\n\nSimilar themes and approaches were to be explored in the work of directors such as Jia Zhangke, set in small-town Shanxi.
