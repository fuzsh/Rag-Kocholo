        "text": "A child needn’t know the historical context, complexity or details of either the Cultural Revolution in China or the Japanese internment in America to sense the trauma they wrought. Even adults recoil from contemplating it. Yet two new picture books offer narratively strong, visually arresting and moving examples of why and how picture books can convey with immediacy and resonance the impact of profound historical events.\n\nAlthough “Red Kite, Blue Kite” and “Fish for Jimmy” tell dissimilar stories, set in different eras and in different places, each explores the effects of great social and political forces on the everyday lives of young boys, and shows how government edicts trickle down to the household level, dislocating children and separating them from their loved ones — fathers, in these two cases.\n\n“Red Kite, Blue Kite,” written by Ji-li Jiang and illustrated by Greg Ruth, takes place during the Cultural Revolution in China, when millions of families were uprooted, and children were forced to leave their homes and schools to do menial farm work. Before this upheaval, Tai Shan and his Baba loved to fly kites together, and Baba would tell Tai Shan stories. “Then a bad time comes,” Tai Shan recounts in the straightforward manner of young schoolboys. Baba is sent to a labor camp, while Tai Shan goes to a nearby village where he lives with a farmer, Granny Wang.\n\nTai Shan misses his father terribly and dreams of being back home with him and flying their kites, even as his father comes to visit every Sunday. When Baba can no longer visit (menace is implied, but the precise reasons are mercifully unstated), each resolves to fly his kite alone, as a signal sent across the great span of distance that separates them. When Tai Shan sees his father’s kite, he imagines, “The kite waves at me and whispers, ‘Here I am, my son.’”"
