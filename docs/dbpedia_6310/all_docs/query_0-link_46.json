        "text": "This movie is just breathtaking in its many symbolism. It’s amazing how many of them were used to imply the negativity of the political movements in China. Already in the beginning we are hinted at the topics that are to come in the movie.\n\nA brief synopsis (for this story truly is complicated and has many obstacles in it):\n\nThis story is told through the eyes of a young boy, Tietou. He takes us through his life, from his parent’s marriage to the day he was born, to his father’s untimely death, to his mother’s second marriage, to his second father’s untimely death, to his mother’s third marriage, to his third father’s untimely death and till the very day that he lies down on the ground at the end of the movie looking up at his broken blue kite, unsure of his mother’s fate, as well as his.\n\nTo read a more detailed synopsis of this film, please click here.\n\nI had great fun picking out the symbolism in the film. I could figure out some of the symbolism, but others I could only point out because I was not entirely sure what they meant.\n\nThe very first one we see, is the wedding gift from Uncle Li, Tietou’s father’s colleague who afterward became Tietou’s second father. The wedding gift is that of a pair of clay horses, male and female. The head of the brown horse, which i assume is the male horse, dropped off at the end of the wedding. I assume that the brown horse therefore symbolizes Tietou’s first father.\n\nWhen I first watched it, I knew that the beheaded horse is very significant to the story. But I couldn’t quite yet figure out why. It’s only after I re-watched the film again did I realize that Li, who had caused Tietou’s father to be sent to work camps, was the direct cause for Tietou’s father’s death there. Therefore, Li being the one who gave the clay horse to them, and having the head of the male horse, which symbolizes the first father, dropped off after that, symbolizes how Li was the maincause of death of Tietou’s father. And it’s cool how the lyrics of the song that was being sung at that time coincides with the picture. Beautiful synchrony.\n\nAnother symbolism that is recurring is the blue kite. It appeared in the beginning when Tietou’s father made him one. And references to it occurred throughout the film. Towards the end, the kite is torn and is way out of reach on top of a tree. The blue kite, to me, symbolizes hope. There was always this tinge of hope throughout the film. But in the end, that hope was shattered and out of reach. It was as ambiguous as the ending, for we do not know what happened to Tietou and his mother, and that we feel like there is no longer any hope left for them.\n\nAnother symbolism that was mentioned in the film is the red cloth that acts as the guest book during his mother’s wedding. On the red cloth are names of the attendees of their wedding. And it was mentioned towards the middle of the film, that everybody whose names are on that red cloth have either died, criticized the party and got into trouble or worse. The colour red could be a symbol of the political party. And it could also be the colour of blood. So they both go hand in hand; how blood from these people whose names are on the cloth are spilled in the hands of the political party. What a strong, negative symbolism. It’s no wonder that this film was banned in China, and it was after this film that earned Tian Zhuangzhuang a further 10 years ban from filming.\n\nAnd just to mention a few other symbolism; there were sparks literally flying between Uncle Li (second father) and the mother. These sparks actually came from the firecrackers that were set off during the new year. The framing was done perfectly with the sparks flying directly between Li and the Mother. And soon afterward, they agreed to marry. How foretelling.\n\nThe next symbolism occurs at the first father’s workplace. There was a meeting on the issue of who they will have to report to the Communist Party as a “rightist” in order to meet Mao’s quota. And at that moment, the father quickly leaves for the bathroom. And this is where the beautiful symbolism is: The father left the meeting room through the left door, opening it with his left hands. He re-enters through the same door, but this time from his point of view, it was the right door and he had opened it with his right hand.\n\nHow beautiful is that? And after that, every worker in the meeting room had agreed to write his name in as the “rightist”. He left as a “leftist” but he returns as a “rightist” to the eyes of his colleagues.\n\nIt’s enjoyable to find all these tiny symbolism. There are many more, of course. In fact, I think there are too many to be able to successfully find all. But it’s a great pleasure to discover them all the same.\n\nThe most chilling part of the story, I must say, is the ending, when teenagers and students revolt against their teachers and their elders, following the teachings of the political movements. It was really horrible looking at students mistreating their principals or parents. It’s the exact same fear that George Orwell expressed in his book “Nineteen Eighty Four”, of children acting as thought-police, reporting on their parents who are having negative thoughts about Big Brother. Extremely chilling.\n\nDespite being an overall depressing film, I actually enjoyed being depressed. It was a good experience watching this film, feeling all sorts of emotions; watching all his three fathers dying… that was really sad. And to see his mother being taken away… unimaginable.\n\nHaunting ending.\n\nLet me just add one more wonderful mise en scene.\n\nHAUNTING."
