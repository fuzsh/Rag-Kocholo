Tian Zhuangzhuang's touching and humane story is reflected through the experience of young Tietou, following the trials, tribulations and devastation's of a Beijing family as they experience the political and social upheavals in 1950's and 60's China.\n\nWith two educated parents (a librarian and a school teacher) Tietou's upbringing is one surrounded by the bustle of growing political awareness. His parents, both loyal communist party members, learn that innocent criticism can at once be misinterpreted by the Party as imperialist propaganda, to the detriment of family peace and prosperity. Tietou observes these mounting pressures and the adverse effects of party policy on his family for fifteen years, learning to hold dear the values of his heritage and keep tight reins on the string of the precious blue kite given to him by his loving father."
