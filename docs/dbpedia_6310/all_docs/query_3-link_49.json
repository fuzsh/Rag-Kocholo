        "text": "Translating a book into a movie can be a very elusive task for many reasons. This is due to the fact that a book has many key points in it and compressing them all into a certain time frame can be very arduous. Mark Forster’s adaptation of Khaled Hosseini’s novel the Kite Runner is a rather weak portrayal of what the author had originally wrote because of its bad casting choices, very significant and harmful cuts to the novel and scenes added throughout the film. Although the director’s intention to recreate a very touching story into a movie was a great idea, the author could have given more attention to some crucial and important aspects of the novel.\n\nIn the book, the characters had distinguishable traits which may have hinted to …show more content…\n\nAs in all movies that are based on a book, the movie developers chose to add some scenes to the movie that were not from the original story. These additions were most likely aimed to substitute for the scenes removed, however this, once again, took away from the important details that really made the book what it is. On Hassan’s birthday, he was not given surgery to remove the harelip from his face; instead, Baba took him to a special kite shop and let him choose any kite that he wanted. The decision to replace the surgery with a present failed to show Baba’s appreciation for his ‘secret’ son. Although the love for kite running is clearly shown, David Benioff’s decision to have Hassan explain the concept of kite running to Amir was very unrealistic. This event goes against Hassan’s characteristics of being less intelligent and superior than Amir, and creates an allusion that Hassan had superiority and he knew more than Amir about flying kites. Hassan’s loyalty to Amir, and Amir’s superiority is shown in the quote, “Sometimes, up in those trees, I talked Hassan into firing walnuts with his slingshot at the neighbour’s one-eyed German shepherd. Hassan never wanted to, but if I asked, really asked, he wouldn't deny me. Hassan never denied me anything,” page 4. The day Hassan and Ali decided to leave because of Amir’s betrayal was a very sad moment in the book. Khaled Hosseini described the setting as a very dark day,"
