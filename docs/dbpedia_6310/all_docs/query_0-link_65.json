        "text": "Lexi Joyce\n\nCurrently stationed at Lancaster University escaping deadlines. Born and raised with Manchester whims, loves Irish bands and even a crispy Guinness. Dabbles in radio, always found wearing flares with headphones bigger than my head on.\n\nCanada’s art-punk collective Crack Cloud tease their upcoming studio album ‘Red Mile’ with enticing single ‘Blue Kite’\n\n‘Blue Kite’ is a story inspired by concepts of political environments and individual perceptions of culture. Crack Cloud’s new musical project holds an upbeat facade but unfolds revealing its deadly secrets. With lingering tinges of the climax of punk in the late 1970s, this is a shift away from the angst present in the start of their career, and we’re feverishly waiting for what is on the horizon for Crack Cloud\n\nTheir new album ‘Red Mile’, out on 26th July, could certainly be in the running for one of the defining record of the summer, melting the restrictive environment of people claiming the death of rock music. Crack Cloud are pushing the boundaries of their previous projects into a more freeing musical experience.\n\nThere’s an addictive build up of strings and hollow violins until everything is forced to the front in a crushing climax. Choy’s inspiration for the video came from a Chinese 1993 bildungsroman-style film, where a Beijing boy escapes the constricting walls of his political environment by flying his kite. ‘Blue Kite‘ is a similar escape for Crack Cloud, guiding us with their unique brand of punk.\n\nThe energy of MGMT and Phoenix is combined the depth of the teeth-gritting vocals of a late-night punk gig, with a scratchy, pounding bass surrounding Choy’s guiding mouth. The instrumentation plays out in a menacing way, like a warning call or siren, until the backing vocals come screeching in to captivate me into their land in true catharsis.\n\nWatch/Listen to ‘Blue Kite’ here:"
