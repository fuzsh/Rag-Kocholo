The film's central message encourages kids and adults to explore the natural world all around them just outside their door—and disconnect from electronic devices that keep them inside. When I had the opportunity to speak with her after a screening, Susan Todd, the writer, director, and a producer of the film, affirmed her goal for the film was to support outdoor exploration by every child.\n\nLEARN MORE\n\nScreen Daily\n\n- 04/21/2018\n\nA celebration of scientific excellence and an account of a discovery which has ramifications for natural environments the world over, The Serengeti Rules makes for compelling viewing. Based on an acclaimed book by Sean B.
