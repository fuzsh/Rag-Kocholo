        "text": "This research analyzed a contemporary independent Indonesian film entitled The Day the Sky Roared (2015) that was directed by Jason Iskandar. This 10-minute silent film talked about the anxiety of Chinese-Indonesians through the eyes of a mother and her daughter regarding the historical trauma of the May 1998 tragedy. The fact that the film was produced about 17 years after the tragedy suggested the director’s awareness that the trauma remained due to the absence of reconciliation and closure. This research would show how the short film frames the incident and trauma of the Chinese-Indonesians. The research was a combination of trauma studies and film studies that focuses on the visual analysis of the film’s cinematography and mise-en-scene to show the cinematic representation of Chinese-Indonesians’ trauma. The findings show that the portrayal of Chinese-Indonesians still strongly suggests unrelieved psychological discomfort, albeit, at different levels, that is closely related to ...\n\nThis essay examines the acceptance and public interpretation of modern China’s rather turbulent past in light of Yu Hua’s novel To Live and Zhang Yimou’s film adaptation. It explores how fictionalized traumatic experiences have the ability to ultimately and effectively communicate social truth. Other aspects examined are the utilization of death as an effective political critique, the overall significance of and interpretive variances caused by the urban-rural divide in Chinese society, and also the particular molding of citizens’ lives that occurs due to either Mao’s overbearing presence or the conspicuous lack thereof. Types of sources referred to and used throughout the analysis include other significant interpretations of the text and film, recent studies that reveal new perspectives on relatively unexplored territory in China’s past such as the Great Leap Forward and its famine, and other articles that strictly examine Yu Hua’s writing style and his treatment of trauma througho...\n\nThis chapter examines Gao Xingjian’s aesthetic exploration of Cultural Revolution trauma in his selected short stories. In order to establish a space of introspection that is free from political distractions, Gao’s aesthetic technique of “flow of language” portrays the scarred subjectivity rather than the devastating political and ideological struggles during the Cultural Revolution. Paradoxically, this intentional silence towards politics adds diversity to the state-controlled narrative of Cultural Revolution trauma."
