Comrade Stalin’s death postpones Lin Shaolong and Chen Juajan’s marriage. Their son’s voiceover notes the delay. Like David Copperfield, he refers to time even prior to his birth. At the ceremony, his future parents first pay respect to the wall portrait of Mao Zedong. Mao’s image, actually, falls between them—the iconography of pervasive political power. A year later, the narrator is born. First he is called Lin Dayu—“Big Rain”—because of the weather that day; thereafter, Tietou—“Iron Head”—for the strength it indicates by way of compensation for that weather. This is normal stuff regarding parental names for children. But everything, including this, takes on a different meaning when symbolical power must be drawn to compensate for the everyday autonomy one isn’t allowed. In this context, I differ with most commentators as to the (gorgeous) visual punctuation that Tian Zhuangzhuang, the filmmaker, provides with shots of the blue kite sailing in the open sky. Freedom and hope, others say. I say: compensation for the lack thereof, and implicit defeat and resignation. Of course, I and everyone else are both right.\n\nThis is a narrative film—hence, one that is highly reliant on Mao Xiao’s script. This is a family and community saga, but one in which Tian’s patient, incisive filmmaking counts most heavily. Politics determine everyone’s life, including the lives of those who deny the importance of politics.\n\nNothing inherent in communism as political ideology helps explain the constraint under which ordinary people’s lives are put. This isn’t a negative film, only a particular, sharply observant one. The boy grows up and passes on the kite.\n\nCritic Andrew Sarris has called Lan feng zheng “[t]he most amazing act of political courage and defiance I have seen in the cinema.”\n\nCould be.\n\nB(U)Y THE BOOK\n\nMY BOOK, A Short Chronology of World Cinema, IS CURRENTLY AVAILABLE FROM THE SANDS FILMS CINEMA CLUB IN LONDON.
