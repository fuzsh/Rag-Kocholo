        "text": "Introduction\n\nThe motion picture is a tool of memory, for which various visual elements are deployed to recapture the past, to formulate a narrative of the bygone time, with the complexity of cinematic language that the viewers are brought to revisit their past. What in the past would people like to revive? Probably the most exciting and the most painful moments; for example, The Cultural Revolution has been a national trauma in the late history of China, while many people survive those chaotic days, and have become the audiences of those films in the 1990s, which framed the Cultural Revolution as a history full of emotions.\n\nTwo films will be discussed as examples of such projects of visual reconstruction of the past: The Blue Kite 藍風箏 (1993) directed by Tian Zhuangzhuang, and In the Heat of the Sun 陽光燦爛的日子 (1994) directed by Jiang Wen. These films are chosen as they have shown two distinctive approaches to reveal the past as narratives full of complexity and ambiguity, in contrast to the simple, progressive grand narrative suggested by the authority; and both films have reflexively question the authenticity and possibility of the reconstruction of historical trauma, in the form of visual memory, or storytelling in a cinematic way.\n\nHistorical and Contemporary Background\n\nThe Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is usually called in short “the Cultural Revolution’’, according to Encyclopaedia Britannica Online, which was a nation-wide political campaign initiated by the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) chairman Mao Zedong, from 1966–1976, until he died. Fearing that he would further lose power in the party, and that China would follow the direction of the Soviet Union, Mao launched the Cultural Revolution in 1966, targeting at first his comrades that those potential rivals were replaced by those more loyal to him; and secondly, the young people who had no revolutionary experience, now got a chance to revolt against the authority — namely as “The Red Guard’’, they were empowered to publicly and abusively “criticize” their teachers, government officials and others in senior positions.\n\nThis is depicted in The Blue Kite, almost at the end, the protagonist Tietou joined the gathering, led by senior students, which aimed at “criticizing” the school principal, who was deeply insulted. The innocent Tietou was delighted and shared with his mother that he also spitted at the principal like other students. The subversiveness and pervasiveness were soon dramatized as the Red Guards broke into the house of Tietou’s step-father, who was a Communist cadre, and they took him away regardless of the fact that he was a patient suffering from cardiac illness.\n\nNevertheless, as the Red Guards became out of control, Mao felt disappointed with them, thus shifting his endorsement to the army, in 1968, and many of the Red Guards were forced to move from the urban to rural areas, so that their power could be dissolved. In 1969, the Defence Minister Lin Biao was designated by Mao as his official successor, and then the military force gained central control in the Cultural Revolution. But brutal power struggle continued when Lin was charged as allegedly having a plan to assassinate Mao, and he died in an air crash in 1971, during a flight to the Soviet Union.\n\n1972–76 were deemed as the final years of the Cultural Revolution, while Mao’s health was degrading, the power struggle swung between the Premier Zhou Enlai’s coalition with Deng Xiaoping, and Jiang Qing (Mao’s wife)’s group — “the Gang of Four”. This was the background of In the Heat of the Sun, in which teenagers like the protagonist Ma Xiaojun and his friends were free from the ideological fervour of the Red Guards — thus their libido had to seek other ways to release — courtship and street fight, for example (Braester, 352).\n\nThe Cultural Revolution officially ended in 1977, but in fact the campaign came to an end with the death of Mao in September 1976. Deng Xiaoping finally grasped the power and became the national leader after this chaotic decade (Lieberthal, “Cultural Revolution”. Encyclopaedia Britannica Online).\n\nFilming the past is not only about the past, it is also about the present, that the filmmakers inevitably view the past through the lens from a temporal distance. Different filmmakers may take different positions as points of departure to look at the past, but they are also susceptible to the social, cultural and political forces surrounding them, in terms of how they revisit and represent the past, as well as how the viewers comprehend the past as revealed. The Blue Kite and In the Heat of the Sun were made in the early 1990s.\n\nZhang Xudong points out the significance of that period, the post-revolutionary era of rapid economic reform, as not only after the Mao’s reign, but more specifically, after the June-4 incident in 1989, which was the bloody crackdown by the CCP of a democratic movement which cried for a political reform. The violent crackdown called a halt to the hopeful “New Era” in the 1980s, during which the intellectuals were eager to learn from the West for the pursuit of modernity and looked forward to cultural and social liberalization, after the overall regression due to the Cultural Revolution (Zhang, 624–5).\n\nReassuring through the June-4 Incident, China did not become a liberal democratic state like many other post-Communist countries, after the end of the Cold War; yet it pragmatically stepped into the “free world” of global capitalism. After 1992, Deng had a tour to the southern provinces to relaunch the project of marketization, one that would open further to the world market, by which “China has been rapidly entering its own ‘postmodern’ stage called market socialism” (Zhang, 625). Since the Chinese government took the lead to marketization in the economic realm on one hand, while stayed despotic politically, intellectuals and artists like Tian Zhuangzhuang and Jiang Wen in the early 1990s and their filmmaking have to be situated in this new global context, as their works were subject to the force of commodification in the system of global capitalism, as well as the state force of censorship. As Zhang points out, these filmmakers “embody a cinematic language that absorbs local and national vocabulary while compatible with the international grammar of symbols and ideology via the highway of modernism” (626–7).\n\nThe Blue Kite: beyond melodrama\n\nThe Blue Kite is a moving melodrama which reviews the history in the Maoist era that the state was an absurd and enigmatic force which had devastated the life of an ordinary family, from the point of view of a child, Tietou.\n\nIt was not new for a Chinese filmmaker to recapture the Cultural Revolution in the form of melodrama. In the 1980s, director Xie Jin had worked on films such as the famous Hibiscus Town (1986); however, Wang Ban criticized that “through melodrama it offers a form of memory that forgets more than it remembers” (162). Xie’s works were made in Deng’s era, the age of reform which has allegedly broken away from the chaotic Cultural Revolution, therefore the trauma was seen from a distance, that Xie’s films could “assume the stance of a survivor on this side of the abyss, looking back at the past with a cold sweat, yet confident of his present security” (Wang, 155).\n\nIn Xie’s films, the family and social community still provided shelter to the poor characters from the political turmoil, and finally there was hope of redemption. Such optimistic representation of the traumatic past can be understood allegorically that in the 1980s, cultural elites like Xie Jin enjoyed a sense of liberation and progression that the state had been astray but now it has returned to the right track, and they looked forward to a brighter future (Wang, 157). In contrast to that, The Blue Kite revisits the historical wounds as if they had not passed.\n\nOrdinary families in The Blue Kite were far from the safe haven but exactly the centre of trauma, in which the protagonists became more hopeless because even the family was destroyed by continuous political campaigns. It is signified in the film in the repeated family-gathering scenes, in which Tietou and his mother Shujuan came to the house of Shujuan’s mother to eat together around the table. However, this family circle was made incomplete due to the continuous political campaigns. Firstly Tietou’s father and Shujuan’s little brother were taken away as they were accused as the “rightist” in the “Anti-rightist Movement’’ in 1957; but the hope for reunion was in vain even when Shujuan’s little brother came back (while Tietou’s father had died), because Shujuan’s elder sister, a faithful Communist cadre, was taken away by the Red Guards during the Cultural Revolution.\n\nSimilar narrative is also found in the “core family” of Tietou with his parents. The film is divided into three parts, in each part Tietou had a different father, and it also shows the tragedy of Shujuan as a vulnerable woman who simply desired a normal family with a husband but such desire was repeatedly destroyed by the political force. The first part began with the wedding of Shujuan and Shaolong (Tietou’s father) and ended with Shaolong’s death, which was related to the punitive labour assigned to the “rightists.”\n\nThe second part was about “Uncle Li”, who acted as Tietou’s step father even before he married Shujuan, but died soon because of the political movement — malnutrition due to the hunger caused by the Great Leap Forward (1958–60).\n\nIn the third part, Shujuan married a Communist cadre, a nice man who seemingly would provide economic and political security for the orphan and widow. But the Cultural Revolution as the climax of the feverous and elusive Maoist politics proclaimed the hopeless fate of Shujuan and Tietou’s desire for a stable, undisturbed family, as the cadre father also became the new target of political campaign, and he died soon after being arrested by the Red Guards.\n\nQuestioning the unwilling sacrifice of people in the name of revolution (Zhang, 629), the traumatic story of an ordinary family has casted a passive challenge and criticism to the CCP authority and other factors as a whole (for example, the conflicts among the Red Guards and CCP members that were unexpectedly out of the control of Mao) have formed an enigmatic external force that devastated the mundane lives of ordinary people (Wang, 158–9). In The Blue Kite there is a cry for humanity, kind of a negative liberty that one can choose to stay away from political disturbance, which was destined to be futile.\n\nThe blue kite as a symbol in the film carries more personal significance than the collective — while those porcelain busts and posters of Chairman Mao found in the backdrop of ordinary households, marking the time period and the pervasiveness of the personal cult of Mao, in contrary the blue kite was more significant for Tietou to look up to. First of all, it is blue, distinctive from the communist red; and it represents the wounded subjectivity of Tietou and his personal desire for a stable family. The blue kite appeared at the beginning and the end. In both scenes the camera tilted up to frame the kite in the sky. At the beginning, as the sky was also blue, the floating blue kite seems obscure. This prefigured the personal experience in the dramatic historical context that the dream of an undisturbed, stable family was in view but from a distance, and could be grasped as something certain (Wang, 156).\n\nThe blue kite concludes the film in a similar perspective: this time the kite was not fluttering in the wind, but broken and hanging between the branches of a tree. This is a point of view from Tietou, who had been beaten by the Red Guards, lying with bruises and wounds. The broken kite symbolized Tietou as the wounded subject and his shattered family. When Tietou was a toddler, if he lost the blue kite, his father would make him another. But this time he could ask no one to repair the kite as all his fathers were gone — even worse his mother was also taken away by the enigmatic power behind the political movements.\n\nContrary to Xie Jin’s works that give an optimistic and healing resolution to the traumatic history, and imply the possibility of redemption with a sense of progressive history (Wang, 161), Tian has disappointed those viewers who expect a melodramatic happy ending. The blue kite centering in the frame has rather revealed the enigmatic nature of history and politics, that what “confronts the characters is some incomprehensible, bewildering force working against everybody’s well-being and chronically inflicting pain and death” (Wang, 158–9).\n\nThe personal, existential approach of revisiting a traumatic past in The Blue Kite can be regarded as an ahistorical or timeless past, as Zhang argues, that could be particularly traumatic to those audiences who survive the ceaseless political turmoil while they may find “the way these political events are represented here is not the way they were experienced by the vast majority of the people” (Zhang, 628). The defamiliarization of the past is traumatic as the cathartic function of historical drama has been deprived. The viewers are not informed of any resolution or something to be “learnt from history”. The Blue Kite seems suggesting to them the wound was still there — a wound about every one, about humanism.\n\nAs Zhang points out that The Blue Kite and the likes are “treating personal experience as autonomous, that is, in the disinterested realm of the aesthetic” and “their political poignancy is realized precisely by its insistence on being viewed not as a political indictment, but as an ontological speculation of the ultimate meaning of existence” (628), the care and respect of ordinary people against the inhuman power from outside, thus embody an existential theme of humanism, which could gain appreciation universally.\n\nTherefore the film can be found moving among viewers in various counties even when they lack historical knowledge of contemporary China, as long as they share the humanistic concern as shown in the story of Tietou and Shujuan. The melodramatic framework can be situated in other times and spaces — it could be about an innocent family in Argentina in the 1980s, or about a mother and a son who lived in the Nazi Germany, etc. Nevertheless, the June-4 crackdown reassured that the “existential exploration of the human experience under an invisible, opaque authoritarian order” (Wang, 159) is still an ongoing project, like the broken kite hanging high and untouchable.\n\nIn the Heat of the Sun: deconstructing the past\n\nThe comical Bildungsroman In the Heat of the Sun was produced in 1994, one year after The Blue Kite; however, as Zhang puts Tian Zhuangzhuang in the list of “the Fifth Generation” filmmakers, with Zhang Yimou and Chen Kaige (623–4), but Jiang Wen is not included. It is probably because Jiang was not a director but a movie star in the 1980s while the Fifth Generation emerged, until he produced In the Heat of the Sun (Braester, 351); and that Jiang has a personal style and cinematography distinctive from those of the Fifth Generation whose works in the early 1990s show a traumatic melodrama of the past, focusing on the ontological experience and ordinary lives (Zhang, 623–4). In the Heat of the Sun revisits the Cultural Revolution not as a trauma, although it is situated in the context of the Cultural Revolution.\n\nWhile The Blue Kite is a story of winter, In the Heat of the Sun is a story of summer. The stark contrast in terms of the interpretation of the Cultural Revolution was probably related to the different personal experiences of the directors. Tian was one of the victims of the political upheaval that his parents were accused of as “bad elements” by the Red Guards; and more cruelly, Tian, then a teenage boy, was forced to “criticize” his parents publicly (Wang, 155). On the other hand, Jiang enjoyed his puberty during the Cultural Revolution, free from the political pressure and chaos (at least comparatively) as he was the son of a senior officer in the army, living in the military family housing (Bennett, “Back in Action”. Time.com; Braester, 354). In the Heat of the Sun is adapted from the novel of Wang Shou “Wild Beasts”, in which the protagonist Ma Xiaojun also spent his days delightfully in the military housing in Beijing. Jiang recalled in an interview that “For people my age… the Cultural Revolution was actually a lot of fun. We were just kids being kids.” (Bennett, “Back in Action”)\n\nTherefore, even though the comical representation of the Cultural Revolution may be found uncomfortable by many who had suffered during that painful decade, In the Heat of the Sun still retains a certain degree of honesty about the event, and reveals the complexity of the construction of history. Moreover, reading of the film is further complicated as Braester points out that actually Jiang Wen was criticizing the Maoist history and grand narrative in those years, implicitly as farce or satire (351). In the film, that means smoking, class-skipping, street fights, and courting girls. Xiaojun loved to hang around with a group of friends, among which Liu Yiku was the leader. Xiaojun had a talent to crave a skeleton key with which he could break into the others’ house when people went to work. He once intruded into the room of a girl Mi Lan, and got obsessed with her.\n\nOfficially the Cultural Revolution was a great enterprise led by the admired leader Mao. To be moral was to be revolutionary, and people might learn from the heroic figures in the Model Plays. Braester refers to Ban Wang that “the youth of the Cultural Revolution found both an object of admiration and an identity for themselves in Mao and the State, which ‘because of their sublime qualities, were seen as an enlargement of [the Red Guard’s] own selves. By loving these objects, they loved themselves even more” (354).\n\nHowever, when these appeared in the story Xiaojun, they became jokes and failures, and the grand narrative of revolution was subverted (Braester, 351, 354). For example, Xiaojun wanted to be “heroic”, but that has nothing to do with revolution. Actually he was cowardice that in a street fight, he stood aside watching his friends fighting, until his group overwhelmingly won the battle, and forced a yielder to the corner, Xiaojun broke the head of the surrendered boy with a brick. Far from heroic, he was shameless. Moreover, Jiang juxtaposes the revolutionary song “The Internationale” with the fighting scene, which has rendered the socialist ideal degrading to meaningless battle among vigorous kids (Braester, 358) — actually it can also be an ironic comment on the fanatical Red Guards who were engaged in persistent violence mistaking that there were something ideal and sublime in the back; or otherwise, they just grasped the chance to release the irrational impulse against the weak when they were backed up by Chairman Mao, so that is also far from heroic but faint-hearted and brazen.\n\nAnother cinematic juxtaposition of Xiaojun’s story with the “Maohistory” that has formulated a sarcastic while romantic “revolution” against “the Revolution” was that, Mi Lan has replaced the irreplaceable Mao in the climax of the latter’s personal cult. As seen in The Blue Kite, in the wedding the newlywed bowed to Chairman Mao instead of traditionally the Heaven and the ancestors. Also in Shujuan’s home there was a niche in which a bust of Mao was placed. Chairman Mao had replaced the god in the tradition, but he was replaced by Mi Lan in Xiaojun’s heart. Instead of a picture of Mao on the wall, Xiaojun was fascinated by a bust photo of Mi Lan on the wall. It was probably his imagination as Mi Lan said she had not taken such a photo, in which she was in a red swimming suit. The red colour implies that she was the substitute of Mao — the Red Sun — as the object of admiration of Xiaojun. This explains why Xiaojun became unexpectedly courageous when he wanted to please Mi Lan, by climbing up a very tall chimney regardless of danger. If Mao was the source of empowerment and gallantry for the Red Guards, Mi Lan was the sensuous goddess who gave Xiaojun his guts and an ideals that was bigger than himself (Braester, 360–1).\n\nApparently, Jiang’s ambition was not simply telling a past under-represented — the delightful Cultural Revolution as it was — rather, In the Heat of the Sun suggests a deconstruction of the authenticity of historical narratives based on memory, and redefines memory not as a vehicle of retrieving the “true” past, but of myth-making that when memory is incapable of recording and recalling the past, it is inevitably compensated by imagination. Moreover, the film reflexively shows that the cinematic can serve as a tool of representing and reconstructing the past, by obfuscating and blending the “truth” with the imagined (Braester, 350–1).\n\nThe most significant scene of the film would be the fight between Xiaojun and Liu Yiku in the Moscow Restaurant, which did not exist as the narrator clarified. In this scene Xiaojun stabbed at the chest of Yiku repeatedly, after some seconds Yiku showed a facial expression of surprise that was reminding the viewers that something was strange, that Xiaojun was stabbing “too much” while Yiku found himself in no blood — suddenly comes the freeze frame, and the narrator, i.e. the grown-up Xiaojun, intervened:\n\n“Haha!… Don’t believe any of it. I never was this brave or heroic. I kept swearing to tell the story truthfully, but no matter how strong my wish to tell the truth, all kinds of things got in the way, and I sadly realize that I have no way to return to reality.” (translation in Braester, 352–3)\n\nHe confessed that what had been told could be fictitious, that he could not differentiate between reality and imagination. He even suspects that he might never become a close friend of Mi Lan, or that he had mixed Mi Land with another girl, in his memory. However, after the confession to the viewers that the visual memory of Ma Xiaojun was unreliable, he decided to tell the story again, without judging whether that would be totally real or not. And then the frames rewind, to the point when the friends arrived at the Moscow Restaurant.\n\nBraester finds such a twist important that “Memory finds itself at a standstill. The inability to capture the past — the impossibility of ever reconstructing the past as reality — causes the narrative to grind to a halt” (353). This is a mock at the viewers, the narrator himself, and those who believe that memory is a reliable vehicle to the past, and that may also include Jiang Wen, Tian Zhuangzhuang and other directors who have tried to recapture the past in films.\n\nThrough the freeze frame as a rupture of a narrative of the past, Jiang points out that essentially talking about the past can never be authentic because memory is unreliable. The narrator explained that “My emotions changed my memories, which have in turn played with me and betrayed me. It got me all mixed up to the point where I can’t distinguish between true and false” and that “I started telling the story wishing to be sincere, yet my determined efforts have turned into lying.” (translation in Braester, 355) In order to articulate the past, imagination or wrong memory become inevitable, as supplement to the deficient memory, while the real and the not-real mix together, and there are always residues of inconsistency, reminding the impossibility of a “true” memory.\n\nBraester calls this approach the “street-smart (pizi) history” — “Where memory is brought to a standstill, the historian becomes a smooth operator, sliding between fact and fiction and playing one against the other” (355–6). Being street-smart also means it is in contrast to the grand History provided by the authority, not only in Mao’s era, but also in the years of reform. Actually Xiaojun’s story was looked back from the early 1990s, from a distance that the filmmaker could acquire knowledge about the Cultural Revolution besides his own experience as a teenager, a distance which has allowed him to revisit the Cultural Revolution more critically.\n\nMoreover, the criticism and sarcasm can be brought to the time of early 1990s, as the film ended in the present time, when Xiaojun has grown up. This sequence was shot in black and white, in contrast to the former part saturated in a warm tone. This creates an alienating effect that the past looks more vivid and “real” than the present. Although memory is not reliable, perception and representation of the present time can also be misleading and fictitious.\n\nWhat is behind the inability of one to remember the past (Braester, 357)? The nation under Deng’s leadership still conveyed a grand narrative of “reform” and “development”, in place of the revolutionary jargons in Mao’s era. But according to the “street-smart history”, those narratives are still a mixture of reality and fantasy. Moreover, the Tiananmen Incident in 1989 was a traumatic event that once again has left a point of rupture and blank in the memory, as it has been the political taboo until today. About this second trauma after the Cultural Revolution, people have to forget or ignore — or they can compensate for the blank with their imagination. This unspoken past to Jiang and other filmmakers in China, reaffirms the “memory blank” as an inevitable element of the PRC history. The “street-smart” storyteller can only confess that what has been told and can be told would not be the total truth about the past.\n\nThen the “street-smart history” is matching with Deng’s pragmatism, as embodied in the “market socialism” — economic development without political reform. Actually the translation of “pizi 痞子” as “street-smart” by Braester may miss something. “Pizi” carries a negative sense of shamelessness and deceptiveness that “street-smart” does not imply. On the other hand, “pizi” is different from hypocrite in that, the masses have to be hypocrites — disguising as if they had a true memory of the past; or claiming to learn from the painful lesson and confirm the new goal of China — economic prosperity via market economy. While pizi are those shameless people who admit that they are not telling the truth, as they cannot retrieve the past honestly, but continue to do so.\n\nConclusion\n\nBoth The Blue Kite and In the Heat of the Sun acquire a popular form, so that they can reach the masses not only in their own country but also international viewers, as they have grasped the opportunity when China opened itself to global capitalism. Unfortunately The Blue Kite was official banned (Zhang, 624), but it is a prize winner in some international film festivals, which proves that the depiction of the lives of ordinary humans, as an universal and existential subject, has gained support from viewers who have not experienced the Cultural Revolution. The concrete history was abstracted and reset as a background, as well as an example of a suppressive force against humans, in a universal existential narrative.\n\nOn the other hand, In the Heat of the Sun does not get rid of history, rather it embraces more than one History, deconstructing and reconstructing the multiple possibility of history-making as myth-making. It is because memory as the vehicle to the past is unreliable, and the narrative of the past necessarily blends imagination with reality together. Therefore there is always the possibility to rewrite the past.\n\nBoth films cast a challenge not only to the official narrative in Mao’s era as “revolution” but also to that in the reform era, when “economic growth” and “development” have taken the place of the the official narrative, showing a progressive view of history that the traumatic past of the Cultural Revolution had gone far away, and the future was bright under the leadership of Deng Xiaoping and his successors. But the June-4 incident in 1989 has proved that what was traumatic in Mao’s era still haunts. This was the context of the production of The Blue Kite and In the Heat of the Sun, and it is worth noting that Zhang concludes his essay that the real trauma is not about the past, but “the anxiety that history has not yet truly begun” (638), the “history” of liberty, humanism and democracy in China is still far away not in the past but in the future, as obscure and distant as the broken blue kite hanged in the tree."
