Full reviews of all current releases, movie trailers, showtimes and tickets: nytimes.com/movies.\n\n‘ANTICHRIST’ (No rating, 1:49) Women: evil or just misunderstood? Leave it to Lars von Trier to ask the tough question, and to provide answers that are both incoherent and appalling. (A. O. Scott)20091204\n\n‘BAD LIEUTENANT: PORT OF CALL NEW ORLEANS’ (R, 2:01) Werner Herzog’s pungent, pulpy cop story is, above all, the vehicle for a sustained display of marvelously inventive acting from Nicolas Cage, who plays the title character — a New Orleans detective with serious problems — with nearly lunatic bravura. (Scott)20091204\n\n‘THE BLIND SIDE’ (PG-13, 2:00) Sandra Bullock does good, and then does good some more in this true story of a rich white Memphis family that adopts a homeless young African-American football prodigy. (Scott)20091204\n\n‘BOONDOCK SAINTS II: ALL SAINTS DAY’ (R, 2:01) Much of the original cast returns for Troy Duffy’s sequel, which arrives a decade after the original “Boondock Saints.” Apparently the world has been waiting for another cartoonishly violent, broadly comic, Boston Irish Catholic vigilante action movie with gay overtones. (Mike Hale)20091204\n\n★ ‘BRIGHT STAR’ (PG, 1:59) Jane Campion, following the biographical record closely, tells the story of John Keats (Ben Whishaw) and Fanny Brawne (Abbie Cornish), star-crossed literary lovers of the Regency period. Thanks to the passionate performances and the director’s rough, almost breathless style, what might have been a prettified period drama becomes a seething, swooning inquiry into the nature of love. (Scott)20091204\n\n★ ‘BROKEN EMBRACES’ (R, 2:08, in Spanish) Exuberant melancholy from Pedro Almodóvar. A blind writer (Lluís Homar) is pulled back into his past, when he was a filmmaker in an ill-fated love affair with an actress played by Penélope Cruz. (Scott)20091204\n\n‘THE BROOKLYN HEIST’ (PG-13, 1:25) Julian Mark Kheel’s indie comedy tracks three bumbling bands of would-be crooks as they all plan to burglarize the same Brooklyn pawn shop. Each gang is filmed in a separate style: rap video, black-and-white art house or early Scorsese. Unfortunately, the jokes, and the ethnic stereotypes, are tired in every style. (Hale)20091204\n\n‘COCO BEFORE CHANEL’ (PG-13, 1:10, in French) Less a biopic than a study in the manners and morals of a bygone era, Anne Fontaine’s film follows the complicated love life and budding ambition of Gabrielle Chanel (Audrey Tautou) on her path from early poverty and heartbreak through independence toward eventual fame. Ms. Tautou, wary and astringent, is excellent, as is Benoit Poelvoorde, who plays Coco’s aristocratic lover, Étienne Balsan. (Scott)20091204\n\n‘DISNEY’S A CHRISTMAS CAROL’ (PG, 1:35) A big, 3-D spectacle, directed by Robert Zemeckis and starring Jim Carrey as Ebenezer Scrooge (and also as some of the ghosts who haunt him), this film has a magic that lies not in its effects but in its fidelity to the language and mood of Charles Dickens’s immortal tale of greed and grace. (Scott)20091204\n\n‘AN EDUCATION’ (PG-13, 1:40) Jenny, a London schoolgirl in the early 1960s — played with verve and brass by Carey Mulligan — learns the ways of the world at the hands of an older gentleman (Peter Sarsgaard), who turns out to be sleazier and less worldly than he seems at first. Adapted by Nick Hornby from a memoir by Lynn Bradley and directed by Lone Scherfig, this film is a bit too charmed by its own period atmosphere to take account of the uglier implications of the story it tells. (Scott)20091204\n\n★ ‘FANTASTIC MR. FOX’ (PG, 1:28) A children’s adventure story or a Wes Anderson movie. Both, of course, and Mr. Anderson, using a painstakingly old-fashioned stop-motion animation technique, turns Roald Dahl’s slender fable into his most satisfying film since “Rushmore.” (Scott)20091204\n\n‘THE FOURTH KIND’ (PG-13, 1:38) This supernatural thriller may be humorless, paranoid nonsense, but its biggest failure is its inability to scare. (Stephen Holden)20091204\n\n‘GOOD HAIR’ (PG-13, 1:35) Spirited, probing and frequently hilarious, Jeff Stilson’s documentary follows the comedian Chris Rock as he investigates the complex, often troubled relationship between African-American women and their crowning glory. From beauty shops in America to a Hindu temple in India, the film coasts on the fearless charm of its frontman and the eye-opening candor of its interviewees. Digging gingerly into wounds both political and personal, Mr. Rock transforms a world of hurt into a medium for insightful and often uncomfortable observations on race and conformity. (Jeannette Catsoulis)20091204\n\n‘HOME’ (No rating, 1:38, in French) Ursula Meier directs a Swiss art-house domestic comedy, with a tragic undercurrent, about an isolated, eccentric family (Isabelle Huppert plays Mom; Oliver Gourmet plays Dad) that becomes undone when the highway next door opens to traffic. (Manohla Dargis)20091204\n\n★ ‘THE HURT LOCKER’ (R, 2:10) In this tense, insightful film about a United States Army bomb-disposal squad in Iraq, Kathryn Bigelow has made a crackerjack action picture that is also a drama of character, psychology and ideas. Jeremy Renner, as a soldier who approaches danger with the conviction of an artist and the compulsiveness of an addict, is simply amazing, and the rest of the cast, notably Brian Geraghty and Anthony Mackie, is nearly as strong. (Scott)20091204\n\n‘KILLING KASZTNER: THE JEW WHO DEALT WITH NAZIS’ (No rating, 2:00) This thorough but overlong documentary explores the life and legacy of Rudolf Kastner, a Hungarian Jew who negotiated with Nazis to save more than 1,600 Jews on a rescue train from Budapest to Switzerland. (Holden)20091204\n\n★ ‘LA DANSE: THE PARIS OPERA BALLET’ (No rating, 2:38, in English and French) Frederick Wiseman, master of the long-form, fly-on-the-wall documentary, watches dancers and choreographers, marketers and managers, and the result is a blissful immersion in the world of ballet, which feels by the end like the only world worth knowing. (Scott)20091204\n\n‘LAW ABIDING CITIZEN’ (R, 1:48) A grisly, pointless story of revenge, in which a regular guy (Gerard Butler) turns himself into a murderous superman after his wife and daughter are killed. Jamie Foxx is the prosecutor who tries to stop him but only succeeds in making him madder. (Scott)20091204\n\n‘THE MAID’ (No rating, 1:35, in Spanish) Catalina Saavedra plays the title character in this Chilean movie about a live-in maid whose constricted world begins to crack, allowing life and air to slip in through the fissures. Sebastián Silva directs, slyly. (Dargis)20091204\n\n★ ‘ME AND ORSON WELLES’ (PG-13, 1:53) A charming and modest backstage tale set in 1937, when Orson Welles (Christian MacKay) was preparing a revolutionary modern-dress production of “Julius Caesar” at the Mercury Theater on Broadway. Zac Efron is the teenager who falls in with Welles’s company, and in love with Sonja (Claire Danes), the backstage manager. (Scott)20091204\n\n‘THE MEN WHO STARE AT GOATS’ (R, 1:35) Grant Heslov directs George Clooney, Ewan McGregor and Jeff Bridges in a likable, lightweight comedy, based on the nonfiction book of the same title by Jon Ronson, about an Army unit’s experiments in parapsychology. (Dargis)20091204\n\n★ ‘THE MESSENGER’ (R, 1:45) Ben Foster and Woody Harrelson are Army officers with the grim task of informing the families of soldiers that their loved ones have died overseas. Samantha Morton plays a widow who takes the news with calm sorrow. The terrific performances complement Oren Moverman’s sensitive, understated direction and the rich, observant script he wrote with Alessandro Camon. (Scott)20091204\n\n‘NEW YORK, I LOVE YOU’ (R, 1:50) The feeling is not mutual. (Scott)20091204\n\n‘NINJA ASSASSIN’ (R, 1:36) World governments are hiring ninjas to do their dirtiest deeds, and only a rogue ninja (played by Rain, the South Korean former boy-band member) and an Interpol-style cop (Naomie Harris) can expose them. Perhaps in homage to his rippling star, the director, James McTeigue, drenches the film in water; but not even some lovely flashbacks — first love, first wounds, first downpour — can redeem a movie more committed to bloodletting than to any of its characters. (Catsoulis)20091204\n\n‘OLD DOGS’ (PG, 1:35) Not even the combined talents of John Travolta and Robin Williams can breathe levity into this incoherent family comedy: the worst major studio movie of 2009. (Holden)20091204\n\n‘PARANORMAL ACTIVITY’ (R, 1:39) Best seen at midnight with a crowd, this minimalist fright-fest, directed by Oren Peli, demonstrates the effectiveness of simple horror-movie techniques. (Scott)20091204\n\n‘PIRATE RADIO’ (R, 1:55) A fanciful fiction from Richard Curtis about rebel broadcasters (played by Philip Seymour Hoffman, among others) who, in the mid-1960s, blasted British airwaves and eardrums with the Kinks and other youth-quaking greats of the era. (Dargis)20091204\n\n‘PLANET 51’ (PG, 1:31) Almost every element of this animated film about an American astronaut who lands on a distant planet populated by “Shrek”-like little green men and women is borrowed from earlier movies, then tweaked (and invariably softened) to become a reference rather than a copy. (Holden)20091204\n\n★ ‘PRECIOUS: BASED ON THE NOVEL “PUSH” BY SAPPHIRE’ (R, 1:49) This potent blend of naturalism and melodrama, directed by Lee Daniels, unites a cast that includes the pop stars Mariah Carey and Lenny Kravitz, the comedian Mo’Nique and a fearless newcomer named Gabourey Sidibe in the story of an abused Harlem teenager struggling for dignity and survival. Ms. Sidibe, in the title role, is the key to the film, and her steady, moving performance is a revelation. (Scott)20091204\n\n‘THE PRINCESS AND THE FROG’ (G, 1:35) It’s not easy being green, as the heroine of this polished animated fairy tale — the first from Disney with a black heroine — discovers on kissing a frog. But to judge from how this period movie deals with race, it is a lot more difficult to be black. (Dargis)20091204\n\n‘THE PRIVATE LIVES OF PIPPA LEE’ (R, 1:33) If Rebecca Miller’s film fits into the dreaded category known as the dysfunctional-family drama, it steers away from the weepy clichés and quasi-therapeutic mumbo-jumbo that have given the genre a bad name. (Holden)20091204\n\n‘RED CLIFF’ (R, 2:28, in Mandarin) The seminal action director John Woo returns after a six-year layoff with this tale of warring kingdoms, set in the third century A.D., which reunites him with the marvelous Hong Kong actor Tony Leung. While handsome and intelligent and perfectly easy to sit through, it never really approaches the visceral tug of Mr. Woo’s 1980s-’90s crime dramas. (Hale)20091204\n\n‘THE ROAD’ (R, 1:59) How does the world end? Not with a bang or a whimper, but with polite applause for this noble, earnest adaptation of Cormac McCarthy’s novel and something stronger for Viggo Mortensen’s performance as a father trying to help his young son survive a post-apocalyptic nightmare. (Scott)20091204\n\n★ ‘A SERIOUS MAN’ (R, 1:45) Old Testament mishigas from Joel and Ethan Coen, who retell the Book of Job as a suburban shaggy-dog story about a harmless physics professor (Michael Stuhlbarg) whose life comes unraveled. The usual Coen brothers’ whimsy, with its edge of nihilism, takes on a surprising metaphysical resonance. You don’t have to be Jewish to like this movie, but it will hurt more if you are. (Scott)20091204\n\n‘THE SUN’ (No rating, 1:50, in English and Japanese) A beautiful and eccentric act of historical imagination from the Russian director Alexander Sokurov about the emperor Hirohito during the period leading up to and following Japan’s surrender to the United States in 1945. (Dargis)20091204\n\n‘2012’ (PG-13, 2:38) Roland Emmerich serves up Old Testament-style destruction with a smile. (Dargis)20091204\n\n‘THE TWILIGHT SAGA: NEW MOON’ (PG-13, 2:10) Ready, set, squeal! Chris Weitz directs, Kristen Stewart mopes, Robert Pattison sparkles, and Taylor Lautner growls. (Dargis)20091204\n\n★ ‘UNCERTAINTY’ (No rating, 1:45) A taut, skillful exercise in cinematic clockwork, with dialogue largely improvised by the actors, this movie splits into two parallel stories, one a family drama, the other a thriller, after an opening scene in which young lovers (Joseph Gordon-Levitt and Lynn Collins) meet on the Brooklyn Bridge on a Fourth of July morning. (Holden)20091204\n\n★ ‘WHERE THE WILD THINGS ARE’ (PG, 1:40) Spike Jonze directs this alternately perfect and imperfect if always beautiful live-action adaptation of the Maurice Sendak children’s book about a solitary boy, Max (Max Records), liberated by his imagination. The film has been pitched to a distinctly older audience than the picture book’s original readers, and some younger children might be scared by the snuffling, growling wild things (voiced by James Gandolfini, among others). (Dargis)20091204\n\n‘WILLIAM KUNSTLER: DISTURBING THE UNIVERSE’ (No rating, 1:25) A refresher course on the history of American left-wing politics in the 1960s and ’70s, as well as an affectionate personal biography of the left-wing political lawyer, this documentary portrays him as a heroic crusader for justice, but is not entirely uncritical. (Holden)20091204\n\n‘ZOMBIELAND’ (R, 1:21) Ruben Fleischer directs this minor, overly self-amused, splatter-slicked diversion about a world overrun with the undead. Jesse Eisenberg and Woody Harrelson trade quips and zombie-killing techniques. (Dargis)20091204\n\nFilm Series\n\nLITHUANIAN CINEMA 1990-2009 (Friday through Monday, and Wednesday and Thursday) This overview of Lithuanian film production since the country gained its independence from the Soviet Union begins with a 1991 movie, “Three Days,” by Sarunas Bartas, the enigmatic avant-gardist whose moody work pays poetic tribute to his country’s ancient pagan gods. Mr. Bartas will introduce his film at 7 p.m. on Friday; his haunting 1997 film “The House” will be shown at 3:30 p.m. on Saturday. Among the other filmmakers represented are the documentarian Arunas Matelis (“Before Flying Back to Earth” on Saturday and Sunday); Kristina Buozyte (“The Collectress” on Saturday and Monday); and Lithuania’s most famous film world exile, Jonas Mekas (“Lithuania and the Collapse of the USSR” on Wednesday). Museum of Modern Art Roy and Niuta Titus Theaters , (212) 708-9400, moma.org. (Dave Kehr)20091204\n\nSPANISH CINEMA NOW (Friday through Thursday) The Film Society of Lincoln Center’s annual two-week survey of Iberian production opens on Friday with Daniel Monzón’s “Cell 211,” in which a prison revolt reflects contemporary tensions within Spanish society. There are some familiar names on the schedule, including José Luis Graci (represented by the historical epic “Bloody May”), Fernando Trueba (the heist film “The Dancer and the Thief”) and Marc Recha (the social drama “Little Indi”), as well as newcomers like Gabe Ibáñez (“Hierro”) and Joaquín Oristrell (“Mediterranean Food”). Retrospective programs are devoted to the overlooked documentary maker (and Buñuel associate) Carlos Velo (“Moroccan Romance,” “Torero”) and the actor José Luis López Vázquez (with his signature performance in Carlos Saura’s 1974 “Cousin Angelica”). Walter Reade Theater, 165 West 65th Street, Lincoln Center , (212) 975-5600, filmlinc.org. (Kehr)20091204\n\nJAMES WHALE (Friday through Thursday) It was James Whale’s paradoxical fate to become one of the cinema’s most famous unknown filmmakers. His monumental achievements in the horror genre — this one-week series begins with a double bill of “Frankenstein” (1931) and “The Invisible Man” (1933) on Friday and “The Bride of Frankenstein” (1935) and “The Old Dark House” (1932) on Saturday — have cast his other accomplishments in the shade. But the same seductive blend of tenderness and dread that informs his shockers can also be felt in his melodramas (“Waterloo Bridge,” Sunday), romantic comedies (“Impatient Maiden,” Monday) and a single, outstanding musical (“Show Boat,” Wednesday). Sunday brings a rare screening of his 1933 masterpiece, “The Kiss Before the Mirror,” an audaciously stylized drama (complete with a stunning 360-degree panning shot) about a Viennese lawyer (Frank Morgan) who suspects his wife (Nancy Carroll) of infidelity. Brimming over with masochistic longing, it’s one of the glories of the early sound period. Film Forum, 209 West Houston Street, west of Avenue of the Americas, South Village , (212) 727-8110, filmforum.org; $12. (Kehr)20091204"
