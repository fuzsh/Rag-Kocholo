        "text": "Cold, calculating, and clinical. The feeling of distance and withdrawal from society is at an all-time, record-breaking high here. Not even a third as slow as I thought it would be, but still is fairly quiet and slow-moving. Few of Us is a fantastically shot film that is incredibly thought-provoking, challenging, and a great meditative mood piece that possess few words but speaks gigantic volumes through cryptic, almost indecipherable symbolism and imagery. But I'm sure one of you guys has to break the code, right?\n\nI guarantee that those you have seen this didn't have a single clue has to how this was going to end. Surely unexpected and goes down a path that few would guess it would. It's…\n\nThis is a huge allegory for the Lithuanian independence from the USSR, which is something I’m by no means an expert on, but just as a film itself this is extremely cathartic. It’s very slow, but doesn’t feel like it, and Bartas has so much damn confidence in the way he pulls off such still, immersive photography here. Wish I could find this in HD because it’s stunning. The amount of ambiguity is incredible here too. Although there’s a thread line of a plot, there’s no real backstory or exposition to the characters or their actions but it’s real easy to read between the lines. The main character, a mysterious woman who is dropped off in Siberia and links up…\n\nCould be about so many things. I read up on Bartas’ work before seeing this and while much of his oeuvre deals with the political ramifications of Lithuanian independence from the then-USSR, this seems to be his least political film. Though there is a sense of a world newly separate from the one before, as the film begins with calming, isolated shots of a tiny town up in the mountains, as if this is the idealist view many in Lithuania saw the country heading after the split. Yet as the film wears on, disconnection becomes a prevalent theme.\n\nPeople are totally silent, like they’ve been reduced to a lesser species or are at one with the nature surrounding them. Sometimes…\n\nFew of Us straddles the line in between the slow cinema movement and more explicitly art-oriented, abstract works like those of James Benning. The film capitalizes on the running concern of filmmaker Šarūnas Bartas with the political struggle for independence of Lithuania in order to transpose this critical-mood into the backdrop of Few of Us, where we find in the Sayan Mountains of Siberia a tribe called the Tolofars, whose nomadic and minimal lifestyle contrast with a visiting young woman, who appears to be an outsider to the whole of their lives. In this way the explicit Otherness which possesses the film becomes explicit - our protagonist is as Other to the Tolofars as they themselves are to the rest…\n\n90/100\n\nFew Of Us is a moody meditative piece where a young woman seems to take voluntary refuge within an unnamed indigenous tribe, secluded from the rest of the world, keenly observing their daily lives. With no dialogue in the film, Bartas' minimalist style is reduced to the purest essence of cinematic communication ― visual storytelling. It cleanses the soul.\n\nThere is no well-defined plot or character arc to speak of, and little is revealed about the woman's motivations or thoughts, allowing and encouraging us to fill in the blanks with our own interpretation of the images presented; resulting in an unparalleled level of immersion within this alien world. The camera zooms up close to study faces and tiny fluctuations…"
