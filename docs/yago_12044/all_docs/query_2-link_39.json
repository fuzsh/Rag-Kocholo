I think threads like these are great for recommendations and for broadening one's film horizons. So, I would post a brief summary/review each day of a film from world cinema. November has 30 days, so I'd post 30 films from 30 different countries. I'll also try to keep to films that one can have easy access to, if anyone is interested in watching them. So, what do you guys think? Is anyone interested in something like this?\n\nPost by themoviesinner on\n\nI love the support this idea is getting. Ok, so it's decided. We will start on November 1st and I'll be posting a summary and my thoughts on a film I consider worth watching every day until November 30th, in alphabetical order by country. I hope everyone finds something interesting to add to their watchlist. And just to raise the excitement a little, the first film I'll be writing about will be from\n\nAlbania.\n\nI hope everyone enjoys this thread!\n\nPost by themoviesinner on\n\nDay 1\n\nFilm: Tomka And His Friends (Tomka Dhe Shokët E Tij)\n\nDirector: Xhanfise Keko\n\nYear: 1977\n\nCountry: Albania\n\nA group of kids gets upset when some German soldiers set up camp on the field they play football on, so they decide to exact revenge with the help of their parents. This World War II film is refreshingly uplifting, since everything is shown from the perspective of the kids, for which even the most trivial childish matters seem important and worth fighting for, and is always highlighting the innocence and nonconformance of youth. Xhanfize Keko manages to get some very good performances from her child actors and the beautiful black and white cinematography adds to the picturesque figure of the setting (a small Albanian town). The film can become a bit too patriotic at times (it’s obvious that Albania’s communist government at the time had a hand in its production), but, overall it’s a nice, affective film and a huge landmark for Albanian cinema.\n\nIf anyone is interested the film can be found on Youtube with english subtitles.

I have the list at home.)\n\nPost by themoviesinner on\n\nDay 2\n\nFilm: La Flor\n\nDirector: Mariano Llinas\n\nYear: 2018\n\nCountry: Argentina\n\nA film comprised of six different stories, in which director Mariano Llinas plays with different narrative techniques and genres. A massive work, not only in scope, but also in ambition, it took nearly 10 years to be made. The stories may seem unrelated at first, but the whole film can be seem as a self-reflective statement about the nature of art, how a director relates to his work and his actors and the processes he goes through to find inspiration. The four main actresses that connect the stories shine in all the different roles they are required to play and gradually the film commentates on them as well, on the progress they make to perfect their craft and the relationship they develop with the director and each other. The film can be frustrating and unclear at parts and requires a lot of patience and perseverance to sit through, but it’s one of the best postmodern films of the 21st century and, in my opinion, essential viewing for every film buff.\n\nThankfully, the whole film (all 800 minutes) can be found in the Internet archive (a free web library), so anyone interested can watch it there or download it legally.

The film is a pretty interesting drama, that tackles, not only the difficulties that civilians face during wartime, but also the tensions that arise when people from very different backgrounds (rich or poor, different religions, etc.) are forced to travel and engage with each other. The steamboat can be seen as a model of Bengali society and the film constantly commentates on the various social differences of the passengers, which even war fails to mitigate. The film has some technical problems, as it was obviously shot on a very low budget, but it is interesting nevertheless mainly because it is so closely tied to its country’s ways and culture. Actually, director Humayun Ahmed is regarded as one of the greatest novelists of his country.\n\nFor anyone interested the film can be found on Youtube with english subtitles, although the quality isn't very good:\n\nPost by jimmalone on\n\nI'm not sure if I want to sit through a 800 minute movie, but thanks for putting it on my radar anyways.\n\nThe Bangladeshian film (another country I miss on my have-seen-list) again has a topic that usually draws my interest immediately. Might check it out as well.\n\nPost by themoviesinner on\n\nDay 4\n\nFilm: The Given Word (O Pagador De Promessas)\n\nDirector: Anselmo Duarte\n\nYear: 1962\n\nCountry: Brazil\n\nA landowner in order to thank Saint Barbara for saving his donkey from illness promises to carry a large wooden cross on his back all the way to her church. This sarcastic drama was the winner of the Palme d’Or prize in 1962. The film is an acidic critique on organized religion and how the church and the media can exploit certain events and their followers’ faith and twist them so as to suit their own needs or promote their own beliefs. But the film also explores the relationship one develops with their own faith in an insightful and affecting way. It is definitely among the best and most characteristic works of the Cinema Novo film movement.\n\nThere are multiple full length videos of this film on Youtube, but none of them have English subtitles.\n\nPost by themoviesinner on\n\nI've wanted to watch this for a while, and was so happy to see that it's available!\n\nWithout subtitles.\n\nStop trolling me, man.\n\nThere actually was a version with English subtitles a few weeks back, but got deleted. YouTube DMCA rules are all over the place. Why delete that but have five or six other videos (there are a lot of them) of the film without subtitles or with Greek and Portuguese ones? It doesn't make any sense. But, you know what I do in these circumstances? I just download the video from YouTube, find matching subtitles from the various subtitle sites and then watch the film with VLC player. No DMCA policy will ever stop me.\n\nPost by themoviesinner on\n\nDay 5\n\nFilm: The Goat Horn (Kozijat Rog)\n\nDirector: Metodi Andonov\n\nYear: 1972\n\nCountry: Bulgaria\n\nSet in the 17th century this film tells the story of a shepherd whose wife is raped and killed by four men. Planning to enact revenge, he raises his daughter as a son, teaching her to fight and kill. But as she grows up she longs for a better life. This is one of the most successful Bulgarian films of all time, but it’s far from what one would consider a commercial film. Shot in stark black & white and with minimal dialogue, it is a film that’s brutal and unflinching in its portrayal of hardship and violence. The father-daughter relationship is explored extremely well and the alienation that’s created between them as the daughter discovers her repressed sexuality and grows more empathic for the world around her is handled superbly. A masterful film and one of the greatest tragedies in film history.\n\nThe film is available on Youtube. Here it is if anyone is interested in watching it:\n\nPost by themoviesinner on\n\nDay 6\n\nFilm: The Last Supper (La Ultima Cena)\n\nDirector: Tomas Gutierrez Alea\n\nYear: 1976\n\nCountry: Cuba\n\nA pious plantation owner attempts a reenactment of the Last Supper using twelve of his slaves with the hope of teaching them about Christianity. This is a bold and challenging film with a clear basic theme: how the teachings of the Christian faith are completely contradictory to the interests of imperialism and capitalism. The film is an attack on the hypocrisy of the rich and powerful, who act as devout Christians even though their whole way of life and most of their behavior often counters the teachings of their faith. It also shows how Christianity itself has been twisted throughout history by the people of power, so as to justify their position and actions, that the world must have masters and servants, rich and poor, hunters and prey, otherwise it would be a world of chaos, a world where “Satan” would reign supreme. One of the best films of the 70s for me, a truly daring and intelligent work.\n\nThe film is on Youtube with english subtitles, but the quality isn't very good:\n\nPost by themoviesinner on\n\nDay 7\n\nFilm: Happy End\n\nDirector: Oldrich Lipsky\n\nYear: 1967\n\nCountry: Czechoslovakia\n\nThis is an absurd black comedy about a murder and its consequences. What makes it extremely unique is that the story is told backwards, but not backwards like Memento for instance, but in actual rewind. The film begins with a severed head attaching itself back to the body and it becomes stranger and stranger as the narrative unfolds. We see the main character become happier and happier as he starts to get younger. The dialogue, although backwards (the answers come before the questions for instance), is cleverly written and extremely funny, as are the various gags, which, naturally, rely heavily on the bizarre gimmick. And at only 71 minutes the film doesn’t overstay its welcome. This is one of the most innovative comedies out there.\n\nThere was a version of this film on Youtube with english subtitles, but they deleted it. I can't find it online anywhere with subtitles for free, but it is available on the site easterneuropeanmovies.com, which is a great film site with a lot of obscure films from countries like Poland, Hungary, Russia etc. that you probably won't find anywere else. Here is the link for Happy End on there (it's not for free):\n\neasterneuropeanmovies.com/comedy/happy-end"
