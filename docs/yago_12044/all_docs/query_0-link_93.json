        "text": "The Lithuanian Film Week, the most extensive presentation project of Lithuanian cinema in Poland over the last few years, kicked off Friday night in Warsaw’s Iluzjon cinema. The occasion crowns the year-long series of events celebrating Lithuanian cinema and the centenary of Lithuanian statehood. The opening of the Lithuanian Film Week invited members of Poland’s cultural community, film lovers and representatives of foreign diplomatic missions residing in Warsaw to see Mindaugas Survila’s celebrated documentary The Ancient Woods. The guests were greeted by the Lithuanian Minister of Culture Liana Ruokytė-Jonsson, a press release from the Lithuanian Film Centre states. […]\n\nThe name of Lithuania will be reiterated louder than ever at this year’s Karlovy Vary International Film Festival which opens today. After a 15-year hiatus the audiences will have an opportunity to see a retrospective of classics from the Baltic countries titled “Reflections of Time: Baltic Poetic Documentary”. World premieres of two renowned Lithuanian filmmakers will take place at the festival with both films participating in the competition programmes. Lithuanians will also actively take part in industry events, a press release from the Lithuanian Film Centre states. […]\n\nThe Cinémathèque Française in Paris is hosting one of the biggest projects presenting Lithuania’s national cinema, a two-week long film retrospective which opened yesterday. It also marks the launch of a cycle of events in France to celebrate the centenary of the restoration of Lithuania’s statehood. The French cinema-going public will have the chance to explore the most extensive programme of Lithuanian film put together in recent years, covering several generations of filmmakers and a variety of genres and styles, Lithuanian Film Centre announced in its press release. […]\n\nOrganizers of the film festival Šeršėliafam have decided to exclude the movie featuring Šarūnas Bartas, the film director under the suspicion of sexual harassment, from the opening night, delfi.lt news portal said on Friday. […]\n\nLithuanian film director Šarūnas Bartas on Tuesday said he disagreed with the sexual misconduct accusations leveled against him by two female artists, adding he would move out of the premises leased by the municipality for his Kinema studio on preferential terms. […]\n\nCulture Minister Liana Ruokytė-Jonsson on Monday voiced her support for women and men who come forward about sexual abuse as public accusations of sexual misconduct were made against Lithuania’s internationally-known film director Šarūnas Bartas. […]\n\nThe decision was taken by the Lithuanian committee of the American Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences. Frost, which is the latest work of the filmmaker Šarūnas Bartas, competed for the right to run for the prestigious award in the category of the best foreign language film with the other two candidates – The Saint directed by Andrius Blaževičius (2016) and Together For Ever by Lina Lužytė (2016). […]\n\nAfter a long break, Lithuanian filmmakers will present their works at two leading film festivals of Venice and Toronto. Lithuania is the only Eastern European country to present its productions to the audiences of the key autumn events in Europe and North America. […]\n\nOn 22 May, 2017, during the 70th Cannes International Film Festival, representatives of the Polish Film Institute and the Lithuanian Film Centre – director Magdalena Sroka and director Rolandas Kvietkauskas – signed an agreement to strengthen cooperation between the two national institutions in the field of cinematography and the implementation of joint film projects.
