        "text": "The film “Frost” (“Szron”), a minority co-production co-financed by the PFI – Polish Film Institute and directed by Šarūnas Bartas, has qualified for the Quinzaine des Réalisateurs (Directors’ Fortnight) section at the 70th Cannes Film Festival. Grzegorz Mołda’s film “Time To Go” had previously also qualified for the Short Film Competition.\n\n“Frost”\n\nRokas and Inga, a couple of young Lithuanians, volunteer to drive a cargo van of humanitarian aid to Ukraine. When plans change and they find themselves left to their own, they cross the vast snowy lands of the Donbass region in search of allies and shelter, drifting into the lives of those affected by the war. They approach the frontline in spite of danger, growing all the more close to each other, as they begin to understand what it is like to be living through war.\n\nThe Creators\n\nThe film is a French-Lithuanian-Ukrainian-Polish co-production. The Polish co-producers of the film, which was made by a Lithuanian director, are Maria Blicharska and Monika Sajko-Gradowska from Donten & Lacroix Films.On the French side, the movie was co-produced by KinoElektron and Reborn Production, with Studija Kinema the Lithuanian co-producer and Insight Media and Tato Film the Ukrainian co-producers. The film was directed by Šarūnas Bartas, who co-wrote the script with Anna Cohen-Yanay. In addition to the Lithuanian actors, the film also features performance by Polish actor Andrzej Chyra. French actress Vanessa Paradis also appears in the film.\n\nThe Lithuanian Director’s Latest Film in Cannes\n\n“Frost” is the ninth film in the career of its Lithuanian director and his fifth to be presented at the Cannes Film Festival. His previous film, “Peace to Us in Our Dreams”, was screened in the Quinzaine des Réalisateurs section in 2015.\n\nThis year, the Quinzaine des Réalisateurs section will show 19 feature films and 10 shorts.\n\nPolish Accents in the Quinzaine des Réalisateurs\n\nPreviously, the Quinzaine des Réalisateurs section has presented such films as “The Here After” by Magnus von Horn, “Refugiado” by Diego Lerman with photography by Wojciech Staroń, “Four Nights with Anna” by Jerzy Skolimowski and “Code Blue” by Urszula Antoniak, as well as the short films “Drawn From Memory” by Marcin Bortkiewicz, “Fragments “directed by Agnieszka Woszczyńska and “The Congress” by Ari Folman.\n\nThe Polish Film Institute Supports International Co-Productions\n\n“Frost” received financing from the PFI – Polish Film Institute in the 3/2016 session with the new priority on supporting international minority co-productions.
