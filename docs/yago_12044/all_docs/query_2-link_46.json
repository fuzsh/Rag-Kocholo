Au Crépuscule (Dusk) was financed by Film Center Serbia/Serbia’s Biberche Productions, Lithuania’s Studija Kinema and France’s KinoElektron. His Frost (2017) DP Eitvydas Doskus, who also lensed Bartas’ yet-to-be-released documentary Watermarker (Acqua Alta) featuring Toni Servillo, is on hand for the project, which stars Alina Zaliukaite-Ramanauskiene, Marius Povilas Elijas Martynenko, Arvydas Dapsys and Vita Siauciunaite. Bartas picked up some awards out of the Berlin Forum with his 1991 debut Three Days and competed in Venice with his 2000 title Freedom. Cannes has featured Bartas the most to date, with his 1996 film Few of Us and 1997 film A Casa programmed in Un Certain Regard, while 2017’s Frost, featuring Vanessa Paradis, played Director’s Fortnight.\n\nGist: Co-written by Ausra Giedraityte, an actress making her screenwriting debut, the latest from Bartas is a period piece set in 1948, about a 19-year-old who joins a group of partisans resisting Soviet occupation."
