        "text": "Launched 13 years ago, the Cannes Classics focuses on screening digitally-remastered prints of the masterpieces of world cinema. As stated by its creators, this festival section is an homage to the remastering work done around the world and to the efforts of film organisations, copyright holders, film archives, and production companies around the world. The Cannes Classics screenings are often accompanied by Q&A sessions with the filmmakers and the crew involved in the digital remastering process.\n\nThe film continues the story of the family of Mateusz Birkut, the protagonist of Wajda's earlier film Człowiek z marmuru (Man of Marble). During the events that took place in Poland in August 1980, Aleksander Ścibor-Rylski, wrote the script in six days, based on documents from the strike in the Gdańsk Shipyard, eye-witness accounts, and tape recordings. The film also featured previously unreleased footage from the events of December 1970.\n\nGolden Palm and Oscar Nomination\n\nCzłowiek z żelaza (Man of Iron) was made at an impressive speed; the film was still in principal photography as it was edited and translated into French to be able to screen in Cannes. The print arrived barely in time for its screening on May 27, 1981, which did not prevent the film from winning the Palme d'Or. Człowiek z żelaza (Man of Iron) then went on to receive an Oscar nod in the Best Foreign Language Film category.\n\nThe film's Polish premiere was delayed, mainly due to the director's adamant stance resisting censorship — it was finally released on July 26, 1981. As Andrzej Wajda recalled, he had been asked to remove scenes or dialogue that cast the authorities in an unfavourable light; the censors were particularly sensitive about the parts of the film that focused on the events of December 1970.\n\nLater that year, the film received the Solidarity award at the Polish Film Festival in Gdańsk, followed by an Oscar nomination for Best Foreign Language Film a few months later.\n\n\"Man of Iron complemented my civic education and shaped my way of thinking about our country and history. I sometimes come to the terrifying realisation that if I hadn't met the right people, read the right books, I would have remained a clueless imbecile. The film touches on a similar theme: thanks to Birkut, Agnieszka enters the world of thinking people, which changes her completely,\" recalled Krystyna Janda years later.\n\nJerzy Radziwiłowicz in the Lead Role\n\nThe film stars Jerzy Radziwiłowicz, with supporting performances by Krystyna Janda, Marian Opania, Bogusław Linda, Janusz Gajos, Andrzej Seweryn, Marek Kondrat, Bożena Dykiel, Artur Barciś, Janusz Zaorski, and Krzysztof Zaleski. Człowiek z żelaza (Man of Iron) was lensed by Edward Kłosiński and produced by Zespół Filmowy X.\n\nOver time, the film received more critical opinions that emphasised its lack of nuance, however Człowiek z żelaza (Man of Iron) remains indisputably one of the most important films in Polish cinema. Martin Scorsese included Man of Iron in his selection of the Masterpieces of Polish Cinema.\n\nMarta Sikorska\n\nTranslated by Karolina Kołtun\n\n----\n\nROMAN POLAŃSKI'S FILM SUPPORTED BY THE POLISH FILM INSTITUTE IN CANNES LINE-UP\n\nRoman Polański's new feature Based on a True Story, co-financed by the Polish Film Institute, will screen in official selection at the 70th Cannes International Film Festival, playing out of competition.\n\nBased on a True Story\n\nRoman Polański's latest feature is based on \"D'après une histoire vraie,\" a novel by Delphine De Vigan, published in France in 2015. Based on a True Story is the third film by Roman Polański to be supported by the Polish Film Institute, and the second to be co-produced by Monolith Films.\n\n\"This is the story of a writer who greatly resembles the author. She too has written a book that became a bestseller, in which she painted a portrait of her suicidal mother with a borderline personality. Her success leads to a series of book signings that leave the writer completely exhausted. To top it off, she starts receiving anonymous letters, accusing her of exploiting her mother's death for fame and of slandering her family. One day she meets L., a women of a similar age. They become friends. Delphine confides in L., who shows her a level of compassion and understanding like no one else. L. moves in with Delphine and takes care of her. She even begins replying to emails sent to Delphine. How far will L. go? Has she come into Delphine's life to fill a void, or to wreak havoc? Vigan brilliantly portrays the toxic relationship between the two women that leads to one gradually gaining control of the other,\" reads a statement on the website of Sonia Draga, the Polish publisher of De Vigan's book.\n\nThe Cast & Crew\n\nStarring Eva Green and Emmanuelle Seigner, the film shows a stand-off between two strong female personalities competing for supremacy and even struggling for their lives. The script was written by Roman Polański and Olivier Assayas, and the film was lensed by Paweł Edelman. The leading producer is Paris-based WY Productions.\n\nThe film was co-financed by the Polish Film Institute within the framework of the new initiative for supporting minority co-productions. Two other films financed within this support scheme: Scaffolding by Matan Yair and Frost by Šarūnas Bartas were selected for this year’s Cannes.\n\nScreenings:\n\n27.05, 08:30, 14:30, 19:00 Grand Theatre Lumiere\n\n1900 feature film submissions for this year's Cannes fest\n\nThis year's Cannes festival saw over 1900 feature film submissions.

Asher's father sees the boy as the successor to the family business — a company that specialises in building scaffoldings. Meanwhile Asher forges a special bond with his literature teacher Rami and begins to see life outside his father's business. At least until a tragic accident completely changes the course of events.\n\nOne of the greatest strengths of this film by first-time director Matan Yair is the exceptionally believable performance by the lead non-professional actor Asher Lax.\n\nInternational Co-Production Supported by the Polish Film Institute\n\nScaffolding was made as a co-production between Israeli production company Green Productions (Tom Shoval's Youth), Polish company Film Produkcja run by Stanisław Dziedzic (Illegitimate by Adrian Sitaru and upcoming Gareth Jones by Agnieszka Holland), Mastershot (Thrice Falles The Saint to be presented at New Horizon's Polish Days Goes to Cannes during Marché du Film) and Israeli company United King.

To me, this success is a reward for the years of work so far, which is why I’m thrilled almost beyond words\".\n\nThe Best Fireworks Ever (Najpiękniejsze fajerwerki ever)\n\nThe Best Fireworks Ever is set in a contemporary European city and it tells the story of a day in the lives of three young friends who are forced to change their plans for the future in the face of armed conflict in their country. The film features Justyna Wasilewska, Malwina Buss and Piotr Polak in the leading roles and cinematography by Michał Dymek, with Beata Rzeźniczek as its executive producer.\n\nSecond time Munk Studio has had a film in competition at Cannes\n\nThe Artistic Director of Munk Studio-PFA, Jerzy Kapuściński, remarks that \"This is the second time Munk Studio has had a film in competition at Cannes. And again, it’s a source of immense delight. We know that every artist dreams of their film having its premiere there. We had faith in the success of Aleksandra Terpińska’s film from the outset and we firmly believe that Cannes is the perfect springboard for her\".\n\nThe film was made on the basis of Aleksandra Terpińska’s winning entry to the Blind Chance thirty-minute screenplay competition held by Telewizja Kino Polska (Polish Cinema TV), the Polish Audiovisual Producers’ Chamber of Commerce, Munk Studio-PFA and TOR Film Production in 2016 to mark Kieślowski Year. Munk Studio-PFA is the producer of the film and the other organisers of the competition are the co-producers, along with MX35 and Dreamsound. Ewa Jastrzębska, Production Director for Munk Studio, notes that \"The Best Fireworks Ever caught my interest at the screenplay stage. But with such a tight timescale and such a modest budget, I did wonder whether a team of young filmmakers would succeed in accomplishing all the concepts and scenes. And, believe me, they weren’t easy. Nonetheless, the entire team has proved that, even with tight time limits and a small, fixed budget, it’s possible to make the film you want to make and without departing from the screenplay or going for the easy way out, either\".\n\nDistribution of the film is being handled by New Europe Film Sales, the company responsible for representing this year’s winner of the Oscar for Best Live Action Short Film, Sing, and works by Ruben Ostlund and Magnus van Horn, amongst others.\n\nScreenings:\n\n24.05, 14.30 Miramar\n\n24.05, 20.00 Miramar\n\n26.05, 18.30 Alexandre III\n\nAleksandra Terpińska\n\nA director and screenwriter of short films, commercials and music videos, Aleksandra Terpińska studied directing at the University of Silesia in Katowice and psychology in Wrocław.
