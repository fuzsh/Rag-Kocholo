        "text": "There are always so many strands taking place at Il Cinema Ritrovato that I often don’t see more than one or two of any of the others. The main one with the largest most diverse collection of films, united only by the fact that they have been recently restored, is ‘Recovered and Restored’ (which is where The Annihilation of Fish and I’m an Elephant, Madame both sit). There was a strand on actor Marlene Dietrich, director Sergei Parajanov, directors Gustaf Molander and Pietro Germi (I didn’t see anything of these), documentaries, films of 1904 and of 1924, something called ‘Dark Heimat’ (which I also managed to miss entirely due to clashes), and a few other smaller ones, dedicated to small gauge celluloid and children’s films.\n\nPerhaps the most surprising film I saw, mainly because it was a film that came out while I’ve been going to movies by a director I really admire that I had no idea about, was The Annihilation of Fish (1999). I’ve been a fan of Charles Burnett ever since seeing the restored rerelease of Killer of Sheep back when I first visited New York in 2003. What I didn’t know was that even then discussions were in progress between Burnett and Milestone to get his then-latest film out and that’s it’s taken until now for that to be realised. Indeed I’d never even heard of this film but it turns out to be rather a sweet delight. It’s a film with a lot of broken people struggling through life but there’s no sense of malice about them or the film, which treats each of them—mad as they are—as people just living their lives and trying to get through and somehow meeting one another on the same level. James Earl Jones plays a man who literally wrestles with a demon and when he throws it off the filmmakers construe to have the tree beneath his window shake each time as if the demon is real, because I suppose it is. Less certain is Jones’s Jamaican accent but his presence is warm and grounding and the film is a great rediscovery.\n\nAnother restored rediscovery was the West German film I’m an Elephant Madame (1969). There was quite a rich seam of experimental filmmakers in West Germany in the 60s it seems. Some of them went on to fame as part of the New German Cinema and some of them made films that sort of disappeared from view (well, at least, my view). I think of narratives like The Cat Has Nine Lives (from a feminist perspective) or this one, which has a somewhat more contested relationship to its culture I feel, in the sense that I’m not quite clear whose side it’s on (possibly just its own). There are teachers at a school and there are the students and all seem equally ridiculous in their ideological positions (perhaps if…. is another point of comparison, made the previous year). Personally I love the style, which involves a lot of well-lit frontal compositions, edited with Vertov-like verve and set to a largely Velvet Underground soundtrack. After a while it feels a little wearing (at which point it switches to documentary reactions from people in the street to a swastika-based provocation) but I think it adds up to some kind of statement about contemporary Germany.\n\nMoving to the Marlene Dietrich strand is the silent-era movie The Woman Men Yearn For (1929), and as you might expect it’s Dietrich who plays the title (if not central) role. What a glorious, richly textured and vibrant world we lost (for a few years at least) when sound cinema took over. This film has all the hallmarks of bold Soviet montage with its presentation of the factory setting, the beautiful train images when Dietrich is introduced, and the climactic New Year’s ball with its long elegant tracking shots through dancing crowds. The story itself is about an adulterous man who falls for Dietrich’s character, only to discover she has been claimed by another murderous suitor, but it has all the requisite melodrama and the performances are pitched exactly right for the silent screen. Our accompaniment was solo piano from Donald Sosin, which kept things moving along nicely.\n\nFrom the documentary strand (not restored, but shown on 35mm) is the civil rights piece The Bus (1965). Director and cinematographer Haskell Wexler documented a bus journey from San Francisco to Washington for the march in 1963, capturing some of the organisation involved in bringing it together at a small local level and a lot of the discussion amongst the people on the bus as they cross America. We hear from the well meaning white people, including the bus driver and some of the young people, who play folk tunes to pass the time, but there’s also a contingent of Black travellers of all ages, including a veteran of both world wars, another who recounts being chased from Washington due to race riots in 1919, and a guy arguing that if the purpose of the people on the bus is to uphold the struggle for civil rights they should be supporting him to hop off the bus to get some cigarettes in Maryland without being harassed. Anyway, the film sticks purposefully to just the ordinary participants as they arrive in Washington (there’s no footage of the speeches or MLK), and ends with a resounding chorus of “this may be the last time” (I’d say spoilers but we all know that this doesn’t end).\n\nFinally, taking a different turn, the Sergei Parajanov strand featured a lot of his works, including some of his earliest, less well-known, films like The First Lad (1959). If you’ve watched his mature works you’ll have an idea of the Parajanov’s filmmaking style and this socialist realist musical romcom set on a Ukrainian collectivised farm is probably not it. There is some question, apparently, as to whether this is a satire but it seems so ridiculously overblown and camp that I can’t quite imagine how it isn’t (reminding me a little of the jokey tone of Cherry Town from a few years later). In any case it follows the familiar sort of format of the happy (and extremely clean, given the amount of farming dirt) peasants falling in love and getting into capers, for some reason involving a football-based kolkhoz rivalry. Anyway, it’s all very bright and jolly and silly and it amused me.\n\nCREDITS\n\nThe Annihilation of Fish (1999) [USA] — Director Charles Burnett; Writer Anthony C.

Therefore, for my Global Cinema entry this week I’ve gone back to Soviet times, to Boris Barnet’s well-regarded film set on and near the Caspian Sea, which plays an important part in the country’s identity.\n\nRepublic of Azerbaijan (Azərbaycan)\n\npopulation 10,127,900 | capital Baku (Bakı) (2.15m) | largest cities Baku, Sumqayit (325k), Ganja (323k), Mingachevir (100k), Lankaran (85k) | area 86,600 km2 | religion Islam (97%) | official language Azerbaijani (Azərbaycan dili) | major ethnicity Azerbaijani (92%) | currency Manat (₼) [AZN] | internet .az\n\nA Eurasian country in the South Caucasus, it sits alongside the Caspian Sea, with mountains the north and plains inland, and an exclave to the west (Nakhchivan), cut off by neighbouring Armenia. It also includes a contested territory, the Republic of Artsakh (or Nagorno-Karabakh), of primarily Armenian ethnicity, which has its own government but is internationally recognised as part of Azerbaijan. The name derives from the Persian satrap Atropates, who ruled around the time of Alexander the Great, which is itself a transliteration of Old Iranian for “Land of the Holy Fire”, and while the name evolved over millennia, it was only first applied to the region in the 20th century. The earliest settlement dates to the Stone Age, with Scythians and Medes arriving to create their own empires, merged into the Achaemenid Empire in the 6th century BCE. Subsequent Sasanian Empire rule gave way to the Umayyads, then Turkic rule from the 11th century. A number of dynasties, many Persian, competed for control over the following millennium until the Russians invaded in the early-19th century. When that Empire collapsed, the Azerbaijan Democratic Republic was declared in 1918, though it was invaded again due to its strategically important oil and made an SSR in 1920. It declared independence in 1991, celebrated as 18 October. It has an elected President, who forms the Cabinet and appoints a Prime Minister.\n\nThe earliest films were made in the country in 1898 in the capital Baku, a prosperous oil town. A steady number of productions were made in successive decades, particularly after it became an SSR under Soviet control, though never more than a handful each year given its small size and the small number of cinema screens.\n\nBy the Bluest of Seas (1936). The blue sea of this film’s title is the Caspian, and the film concerns two strapping young men who are shipwrecked and taken in by a seaside kolkhoz in Azerbaijan only to fall in love with the commune’s leader Masha (Yelena Kuzmina). It’s a very simple set-up, but there’s something engaging about director Boris Barnet’s way with waves, which seem to frame much of the film’s action, whether crashing over fishing boats, dragging away comrades to their (apparent) deaths, or just in the backdrop of the landborne action. The simple competition between these two men drives the film, one a tall blonde muscular heroic type (Nikolai Kryuchkov) and the other and native Azeri (Lev Sverdlin), shorter and solidly-built—though hardly unattractive either (Soviet or not, this is still the movies). Their aims are of course noble, and when they fall out it’s over their lack of commitment to the collective (with a side order of trying to impugn the other in the eyes of Masha), but the rivalry remains that of two friends, and when the final decision is made, it reminds you that it’s not just the men’s feelings which are at stake.\n\nCREDITS\n\nУ самого синего моря U samogo sinego morya (By the Bluest of Seas, 1936) — Director Boris Barnet Бори́с Ба́рнет; Writer Klimentiy Mints Климентий Минц; Cinematographer Mikhail Kirillov Михаи́л Кири́ллов; Starring Yelena Kuzmina Еле́на Кузьмина́, Nikolai Kryuchkov Николай Крючко́в, Lev Sverdlin Лев Све́рдлин; Length 72 minutes. Seen at home (YouTube), London, Wednesday 22 July 2020.\n\nThe Ukrainian director Kira Muratova died in 2018 after a long career starting in the 1960s. Her filmmaking is perplexing, perhaps wrought from the chaotic times she worked through, dense with allusion and busy with action, almost breathlessly so. I can’t pretend to understand all the details, and in some cases much of it seems to wash over me, but I can’t deny she was doing something fascinating and her films remain worth watching if you can (and they are not always easy to track down). However, she befits inclusion in my Soviet (and post-Soviet) cinema theme week.\n\nThe Asthenic Syndrome (1989). I remember reading a rave Jonathan Rosenbaum review for this film around 25 years ago, but it doesn’t exactly get many screenings, so it’s been on my ‘to watch’ list for quite some time. It’s 30 years old now, and it’s as bitter and bleak as any Soviet film from this era could hope to be, though whether it’s this bleakness or the nudity that got it into trouble with the censors is unclear to me.\n\nEither way, it’s a film that has Muratova’s familiar manic style—of characters who just talk and talk, or don’t stop moving and emoting and punching, kicking, screaming and generally raging against, well, whatever there might be to rage against (but one imagines the State or society itself is a target at some level)—but this is matched with moments of equal calm. This calm, when the movie just sort of stops for some still lifes, or quiet times with its characters shorn of music or sound effects, can come across as soporific or, in the case of one of the main characters Nikolai (Sergei Popov, one of the co-writers), narcoleptic. He’s seen asleep on public transport and all sorts of inconvenient locations, such as a movie screening, ostensibly of the first (black-and-white) section of the film.\n\nIt’s impossible, really, to explain the plot in any way that’s adequate, because this is a film of excesses and it doesn’t hang together so much around its narrative, as around its contrasts, the interplay of its characters and settings, the constant noise and vibrancy and then the quiet. It’s not a film that uses the beauty of its images, because it remains quite resolutely ugly at times, but it’s clearly saying something nonetheless about the state of things. It’s just that it’s a message that can be difficult to take in, especially over two-and-a-half hours.\n\nChekhovian Motifs (2002). Muratova often garners the description “idiosyncratic”, which seems fair: her films are odd. This one is ostensibly a comedy, but in that way that it’s done in her part of the world—with plenty of bleakness mixed in. Not that I really understood it, but then maybe I’m resistant to the atmosphere. There are two strands (from two Chekhov stories): one is a rural family where the elder brother wants to leave and asks his dad for money; the other is a wedding ceremony beset by troubles while the priest is doing his thing. It’s also shot in a high-contrast black-and-white, reminiscent of Alexei Gherman (something too about these former-Soviet auteurs and their opaque films). Odd, almost defiantly so.\n\nCREDITS\n\nАстени́ческий синдро́м Astenicheskiy sindrom (The Asthenic Syndrome, 1989) [USSR, black-and-white and colour] Director Kira Muratova Кира Муратова; Writers Aleksandr Chernykh Александр Чёрных, Sergei Popov Сергей Попов and Muratova; Cinematographer Vladimir Pankov Владимир Панков; Starring Olga Antonova Ольга Антонова, Sergei Popov Сергей Попов, Galina Zakhurdayeva Галина Захурдаева, Natalya Buzko Наталья Бузько; Length 153 minutes.
