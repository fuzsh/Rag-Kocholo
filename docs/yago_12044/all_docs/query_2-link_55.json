This spectacle invades his mind as virus and turns his life inside out. Obsessed with the incident, he starts spying on the young and beautiful widow of the victim, pry her having sex affair with stranger and slipping into insanity. Meticulously inspecting murderers' faces in his mind he trying to fin answer to some sort of a puzzle. This is a film about personality turnout, the birth of murderer. Finally, when identity is born, he came to police and admits having commited the murder. This is a story of false murderer, the murdere without victim but himself.\n\nDirector’s filmography\n\nDmitry Mamuliya (b. 1969, Georgia) is the author of films Moscow and Another Sky, he is also the artistic director of the Moscow Film School of New Cinema. In 1999 he won the first prize for his screenplay What Anne and Vera Have from Tbilisi's Adam and Eva Studios.

The main character seems to be trying on different masks, the one of a murderer, the one of a murdered. It appears that neither suits him. Or is there the one which does? This very question I hope won’t leave the audience while actually watching the film. The script Witness to Murder is based on the encounters of a lonely man looking for his own self. The key character is truly captive. Apart from the key theme, there are lots of secondary ones in the script. The secondary characters are replicating the solitude of the main one.The camera operator and the film director both formed their own unique styles.\n\nContact / Presenters\n\nKINOKULT Ltd.\n\nRochdelskaya street, 15-23, 123002, Moscow, Russia\n\nEmail: [email protected]\n\nMILIMETER FILMS\n\nAhmeteli 10a, 0159, Tbilisi, Georgia\n\nEmail: [email protected]\n\nDmitry Mamuliya | Film Director, Scriptwriter\n\nEmail: [email protected]\n\nTamara Nikishina | Film Producer\n\nEmail: [email protected]\n\nMobile: +790 558 45755"
