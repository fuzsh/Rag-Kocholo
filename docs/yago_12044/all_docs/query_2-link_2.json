Bartas has been likened to fellow Eastern Europeans and PFA favorites Alexander Sokurov and Bela Tarr for his visionary minimalism and the depiction of a society at an impasse following the Soviet collapse. He has also been compared with Werner Herzog for his hallucinatory landscapes, and to Michelangelo Antonioni for his abstract narratives and lost characters. Bartas's extended takes focus on extreme close-ups of faces and longshots of spectacular landscapes, both industrial and natural. His use of sound is minimal but vital, suggesting complex situations just beyond the frame-things sensed but not fully perceived, engrossed as his characters are in their inner worlds.\n\n“Narration doesn't interest me,” Bartas claims. “A film should concentrate on images.” His scant narratives, more sketches than stories, are often circular, ending as they began, emphasizing stasis over change, the present over the past or future, and thus despair over hope. And yet the detail of his observation, the deep integration of an ethnographic sensibility into his intangible fictions, reveals an intense concern with today's society.\n\nIn 1989 Bartas established Studio Kinema, the first independent film production studio in Lithuania. His films have been screened at numerous international film festivals, including San Francisco, Rotterdam, Cannes, Berlin, Tokyo, and London.\n\nKathy Geritz"
