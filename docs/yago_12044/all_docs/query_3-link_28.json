It was co-produced by Studija Kinema (Lithuania) and KinoElektron (France) as well as Russian Lookfilm. International sales rights have been earlier acquired by NDM Ventas Internacionales.\n\nOne summer day, a Man, his new Wife and his Daughter arrive to their countryside house to spend a weekend. The sixteen-year-old Daughter lives with her father, whose attention she lacks. He is tired of his daily routine at work and does not know how to find strength to carry on living. His Wife, a violinist, does not feel any joy of life, as she is confused in her priorities – music, love and career. Despite the fact the Man and his Wife love each other, their relationship is tense and on the brink of collapse.\n\nIn the countryside, the Daughter befriends a Boy, whom she knows from her childhood. They go for walks, swim in the lake, talk. One day the Boy steals an optical sight rifle from a hunters' company. A big chase starts in the countryside."
