In this “Roundtable,” we will dive into how this initiative came to be, both from the perspective of the Viddsee executives and from the series’ creators themselves, as well as discuss the current state and upcoming prospects of online streaming platforms for short-form video contents.\n\nGuests: Kenny Tan (Viddsee Executive Producer) and the creators from the series in selection\n\nKorean Short Films : Current Status and Prospect of Globalization\n\nApril 30, 2022 | Saturday | Cine Lounge, 6F, Busan Cinema Center\n\nMany Korean films and TV series have won awards at major international film festivals and performed well on the OTT platform NETFLIX, indicating that Korean films and video contents are becoming extremely popular on a worldwide scale. There has not been much discussion concerning the globalization of Korean short films, despite the international interest and reputation of Korean films. The Busan International Short Film Festival, which has worked tirelessly to promote the globalization of Korean short films, has organized a forum for participants to debate “the current status and prospects of expanding the international reach of Korean short films.”\n\nGusts: Rimante Daugelaite (Vilnius International Short Film Festival Head of the Festival), Zoé Protat (Festival du Nouveau Cinéma de Montreal Director of Programming), Jayil Pak (Director), Kim Seunghee (Director)\n\nBISFF TALK With Šarūnas Bartas (Film Director)\n\nMay 1, 2020 | Sunday | BISFF Official Youtube Channel | 11:00 am (See link below)\n\n“BISFF Talk” provides an opportunity for a filmmaker and the audience to discuss films together. It is a great chance for a filmmaker to introduce his or her works, as well as for a filmmaker and the audience to communicate together and broaden their horizons on films and the world. This year, we will be joined by Šarūnas Bartas, a world-class cineaste from Lithuania, for BISFF Talk. The invited speaker will talk about his film world, as well as the meaning and role of film in the current global situation.\n\nLINK: https://www.youtube.com/c/BusanInternationalShortFilmFestival\n\nTo know more please visit: http://www.bisff.org/"
