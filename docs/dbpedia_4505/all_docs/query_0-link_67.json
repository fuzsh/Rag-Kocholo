        "text": "Offers the intellectual rationale for the NEH-funded Institute “Worlds in Collision: Nahua and Spanish Pictorial Histories and Annals in 16th Century Mexico” to be held on the campus of Adelphi University from July 19 - Aug 9, 2020. Eleven visiting scholars will present research on the “New Conquest History,” exploring the newly accessible archives concerning 16th century Mexico, which include multiple forms (maps, pictorial histories and annals), many by indigenous and mestizo authors. Three weeks of daily seminars, enhanced by frequent roundtable discussions, will explore the ways in which these newly translated and interpreted documents can be integrated into existing and/or new curricula involving the encounter of cultures in 16th century Mexico. We will make a special outreach to seek applicants from community colleges, including adjunct faculty and qualified graduate students."
