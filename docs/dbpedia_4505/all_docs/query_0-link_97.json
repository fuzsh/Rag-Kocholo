With sixty formal papers and scores of scholars attending from four continents, this conference was larger and longer than its predecessor. As before, our gathering was marked by a special event, the production of an opera, Patientis Christi memoria, composed by Johann Bernhard Staudt and originally performed in 1685 at the Jesuit college in Vienna. Our performance in the chapel of St Mary’s Hall, Boston College, was produced by T. Frank Kennedy, S.J., and directed by Michael Zampelli, S.J. In the appendix to this volume T. Frank Kennedy provides an introduction to the opera and his translation of the libretto to accompany a digital videodisc (DVD) of the opera contained inside the back cover. Our motivations for a second conference on the religious and cultural history of the ‘Old Society,’ that is, the Society before the general suppression of 1773, were like those for the first. We sought to bring together an ever growing community of scholars working on the Jesuits from diverse perspectives and provide them with the opportunity to discuss their work in relation to interdisciplinary themes and overarching historiographical questions. In general terms, our goal was to continue to deepen our understanding of Jesuit corporate culture and its interaction with the ambient cultural fields of Europe and the overseas missions. A leitmotif of the first conference revolved around the question of whether or to what extent the Jesuits had a distinctive approach to issues – what the Jesuits called ‘our way of proceeding’ (modus noster procedendi). A number of papers in this volume continue and enrich that discussion. The disciplinary scope of the second conference and volume reflects, as before, the interests and proclivities of the editors, namely, the history of music, science, and art and architecture. Or, to invoke a somewhat dated but none the\n\nxviii Preface less useful term, the contributions in both volumes may be considered variegated explorations of Jesuit Kulturgeschichte. Neither in the first volume nor in this one have we sought, however, to offer a comprehensive survey of every aspect of the Society in all its multifarious activities over almost two and a half centuries. The volumes leave practically untouched, for instance, the involvement of the Jesuits in politics and diplomacy, an aspect of their activities for which, rightly or wrongly, they are perhaps best known in legend and in novels, opera, and drama. They leave practically untouched their polemics with Protestants, the administration and structure of their universities, and the internal governance of the Society. They leave untouched the Jesuits’ almost countless writings on spirituality. The list could go on. Even though the subjects covered in this volume reflect in a general way those covered in the first, we have tried in certain particulars to move the argument along. We have, for instance, organized this volume differently. Whereas in the first we wanted to show the interdisciplinary relationships within categories of Jesuit activities, in this volume we want to indicate the different expressions a given discipline might take. We have organized most of the sections accordingly. To complement the regional coverage of the first volume, we here present articles on the Flemish and Iberian provinces, and on the missions in Japan and in post-suppression Russia and the United States. The performing arts are more broadly treated than before, with essays on theatre as well as music. In addition to continued attention to painting and architecture, readers will find essays on a range of objets d’art, including statuary, reliquaries, and silver and gold pieces used in the liturgy, as well as on gardens, mechanical clocks, and related automata. Other themes unexplored in the first volume but at least touched on in this one are finances, natural theology, the Society’s relationship with women, and ‘adult education’ in the lay confraternities and sodalities that operated under Jesuit guidance. Perhaps most important, we have endeavoured in this volume to give more attention to the eighteenth century, which is much less well researched for the Jesuits than the seventeenth, the Society’s supposed ‘golden age.’ A number of contributors to this volume explore the richness and complexity of the Society’s activities during that later century, including its ‘age of disasters’– the negative papal ruling on Chinese rites, the destruction of the Paraguay Reductions, the suppressions of the order that began in Portugal and culminated in the general suppression of 1773. This expanded time frame raises questions about the adequacy of received categories and periodization schemes when applied to Jesuit historiography. There are historians of the eighteenth century, for instance, who now speak of a ‘Catholic Enlightenment.’ How do the Jesuits figure in that category? Or can we\n\nPreface\n\nxix\n\nspeak of an ‘early modern Catholicism’ that encroaches on the time and turf of the philosophes? In rethinking Jesuit historiography, might we not wish to revisit Jean Delumeau’s periodization as set out in the title of his best-known book, Catholicism between Luther and Voltaire? Surely it is more than a curiosity that the years marking the death of Luther (1546) and of Voltaire (1778) bracket almost exactly the life span of the ‘Old Society.’ We raise such questions not with the promise that readers will find the answers to them in these pages, but rather with the persuasion that simply asking them alerts readers to issues of the relationship between religion and culture that transcend the Jesuit story. In this matter, as with the whole history of the pre-suppression Society, we are very much aware that, even with the combined efforts of our many excellent contributors to these two volumes, we offer our readers only selected glimpses into a complex and subtle historical record. the editors\n\nThis page intentionally left blank\n\nAbbreviations\n\nMonumenta Historica Societatis Iesu Epist.

The bull essentially incorporated into itself a slightly revised version of a document drawn up in the spring of 1539 by the original ten companions of Paris, informally headed by Ignatius of Loyola, to indicate to the papal curia what they hoped for from their new organization and how they planned to achieve it. That document, known as the ‘Five Chapters,’ might well be called the five (long) paragraphs because it is only about five pages long. The bull in the revised and somewhat expanded form of Exposcit debitum, approved by Pope Julius III on 21 July 1550, remains to this day the licence officially allowing the Jesuits to operate within the Catholic church. It is the charter of the Society, never superseded. As a charter it specifies, among other things, the purposes for which the order was founded and the means it will use to accomplish them. The Jesuits are free to make whatever changes in their Constitutions and ‘way of proceeding’ they deem appropriate, as long as the changes do not run counter to any major provisions of the bull. Should a proposed change run counter to the bull, the Jesuits must, even now, appeal to the Holy See for explicit permission to make the change. Officially known as the ‘Formula of the Institute,’ the bull could not be more sacrosanct. It is the equivalent of ‘the Rule’ in other religious orders. It is the first place to look on the level of official documentation to discover what the Society of Jesus is all about. A brief revisiting of the provisions of the Formula that deal directly with Jesuit ministries will provide, I believe, a helpful framing for what follows in our volume.1 For the readers’ convenience I have appended to this introduction the text of those provisions, with indications in boldface type of changes introduced in 1540 and 1550 into this section of the ‘Five Chapters.’ It might be helpful to take a glance at that appendix before reading further.\n\nxxiv\n\nIntroduction\n\nThe bull faithfully reproduced the purpose the ten founders set forth in the ‘Chapters.’ The new order was to be ‘a Society founded chiefly for this purpose: to strive especially for the progress of souls in Christian life and doctrine and for the propagation of the faith.’ The purpose seems generic and bland, but it deserves some explanation. ‘Christian life and doctrine’ can best be read as ‘Christian life and Christian Doctrine,’ so as to make clear that doctrine here refers to Christian Doctrine in the sense of basic truths to be lived and practised. In the sixteenth century Christian Doctrine was a synonym for catechism. ‘Christian doctrine’ in the Formula, therefore, is not an allusion to the advanced education in philosophy and theology the companions received at Paris; it does not presage the Jesuits’ later formal cultivation of those disciplines in a number of different forms; far less is it a manifesto of orthodoxy in a Reformation context. It implies, rather, a practice-related context. It points to a directly pastoral concern, the imparting of basic teachings as a means of spiritual progress. It is therefore intimately related to ‘Christian life’ because catechism, whether done by preaching, lecturing, or some other means, was conceived as an introduction to Christian living, to the ordinary obligations incumbent upon every believer, even the humblest. This meant teaching prayers, especially the Lord’s Prayer. It meant teaching the Decalogue, especially as preparation for confession. It meant teaching the Apostles’ Creed, usually in the form of stories about the life of Jesus. It meant, almost invariably, teaching the seven spiritual and corporal works of mercy as the expressions of what it meant to live as a Christian. ‘Christian life and doctrine’ meant precisely what John Van Engen has so helpfully encapsulated with the term Christianitas – basic beliefs and practices shared by Christians of all social classes.2 The second purpose was ‘propagation of the faith.’ Today we can hardly speak of Christianity without using the word mission, yet in the sixteenth century mission was just coming into usage in its contemporary sense of evangelization of people not yet Christian.3 The emergence of this usage coincided with the founding of the Society, and the word in fact occurs, somewhat precociously, in other places in the Formula. The Jesuits in relatively short order would be largely responsible for its gaining currency and gradually replacing the older term, even though as late as 1622 the Roman congregation founded to deal with the overseas missions of the Catholic church was called the Congregation for the Propagation of the Faith (De propaganda fide). In 1540, surely, ‘propagation of the faith’ (or ‘journeying to the infidel’) was still the technical term for the enterprise, so we should not be surprised that the companions used it here to express the fundamental missionary character of the order they were founding. They had originally banded together, after all, to\n\nIntroduction\n\nxxv\n\ntravel to Palestine as ‘missionaries,’ even though the term missionary did not yet exist. As a result of their deliberations in 1539, they specified farther on in the Formula that they wanted to be bound by a special vow to obey the pope ‘for missions,’ circa missiones. In their vocabulary, as time went on, ‘missions’ became for a while an almost distinctively Jesuit word. It recurs frequently, for instance, in Part VII of the Constitutions, entitled ‘The Distribution of Members in the Vineyard of the Lord.’ Besides pointing to overseas evangelization, the word points to the basically itinerant style of ministry the companions envisaged for themselves. Indeed, the section of Part VII dealing with missions received from the pope in fulfilment of the special vow implies that these missions would generally be of short duration, about three months. The members of the order originally saw themselves as most characteristically being on the road, with lots of comings and goings.4 Instead of simply ‘the propagation of the faith,’ the Formula was modified in the 1550 version to read ‘the defense and propagation of the faith.’ As has often been noted, the addition of ‘defense’ took account of the growing awareness among the Jesuits of the role they more and more felt called upon to assume in confrontation with Protestantism. Although the Society was not founded to confute the Reformation, as so often asserted, it soon began to take up that cause, and in certain parts of Europe, especially in Germany and England, it would become identified almost exclusively as an anti-Protestant force. In other parts of the world, such as Latin America and Asia, the Reformation entered relatively little into the Jesuits’ self-understanding and practice. Unlike the other modifications Exposcit debitum made in the original bull and in the ‘Five Chapters,’ this one was not an elaboration or specification of something already present but was something new – which points to the obvious fact that the Society was an ongoing enterprise that did not assume its full identity in 1540. The ‘defense of the faith,’ which in the sixteenth century often came down to defences of papal primacy, does relate to the opening statement of the ‘Five Chapters,’ which immediately precedes the section we have been discussing: ‘Whoever wishes to serve as a soldier of God beneath the banner of the cross in our Society, which we desire to be designated by the name of Jesus, and to serve the Lord alone and his vicar on earth, should, after a solemn vow of perpetual chastity, keep what follows in mind. He is a member ...’ The bull of 1540 almost verbatim repeats this mention of the pope, but the 1550 bull modifies it with mention of the church itself: ‘... to serve the Lord alone and the church, his spouse, under the Roman pontiff, the vicar of Christ on earth ...’ ‘Soldier of God’ suggests the stereotype of the Jesuit as a militant, a stereotype suggested even by the title of the bull – ‘militantis ecclesiae.’ Many Jesuits\n\nxxvi\n\nIntroduction\n\nsubsequently appropriated military imagery to describe themselves and the mode of the Society. But in the foundational documents such imagery is much less prevalent than, for instance, in the early writings of Erasmus, that great enemy of militant Christianity. It was traditional religious language. As Antonio de Aldama reminded us, moreover, in his authoritative commentary on the Formula, ‘“To serve as a soldier of God” (militare Deo) is a medieval expression meaning religious life. In the prologue to his Rule, St. Benedict addresses the novice who is “about to join battle for Christ the true King.”’ De Aldama goes on to suggest that in the words ‘under the banner of the cross’ we hear an echo of the Meditation on Two Standards in the Spiritual Exercises.5 ‘To serve ... his vicar on earth’ indicates a connection with the papacy that is, for example, much less prominent even in the Rule of St Francis and completely absent in the Rule of St Benedict. In the ‘Chapters,’ however, I think the mention of the pope must be related to the pope’s pastoral role, as the companions understood it, that is, the role they hoped to see him play in sending them on mission. It should not be understood in the context of Reformation controversies about the papacy and, hence, as a soft way of indicating an obligation to ‘defend’ the institution. In 1550 the wording was changed, as noted earlier, to read ‘to serve the church ... under the Roman pontiff, the vicar of Christ on earth.’ In this shift the connection of papacy with the vow to be missionaries seems less operative, and with the appearance of the word ‘church’ the Jesuits imply a greater awareness of their role in the larger ecclesiastical scene. They now were explicitly claiming for themselves an ecclesiastical mission. They did so, however, according to their own ‘way of proceeding.’ They refused, for instance, to assume any office in the hierarchical structure, and they refused to undertake the staffing of parishes, the ecclesiastical unit under the supervision of a bishop. It is instructive to note, moreover, that in Ignatius’s huge correspondence of over seven thousand letters – the largest extant collection of any sixteenth-century figure – the expression ‘to serve the church’ never occurs. What appears on almost every page is, instead, ‘the help of souls.’ I call attention to the two adverbs in the Formula’s description of purpose – ‘chiefly’ (potissimum) and ‘especially’ (praecipue). They occur in the ‘Five Chapters’ and are repeated in the two papal bulls. They are qualifiers, and therefore leave the door slightly ajar. I see in them an anticipation of a characteristic of Jesuit ‘way of proceeding’ and style that finds consistent expression in the Constitutions. Almost every provision in that remarkable document is accompanied by qualifications. Such and such is to be done, ‘unless something else seems better in the circumstances.’ It is, thus, a document filled with escapeclauses.6 The same can be said of the directives Ignatius offered to individual\n\nIntroduction xxvii Jesuits in his correspondence. As John Bossy observed many years ago, ‘Few religious superiors can have told members of their order so firmly to forget the rules and do what they thought best.’7 Flexibility and adjustment to circumstances were thus inculcated from the very beginning. They were principles explicit in the text of the Spiritual Exercises regarding the way in which individuals were to be guided in them. The Jesuits were surely not the only group in the sixteenth century to advocate and practise flexibility in their endeavours. Indeed, flexibility was a quality commended by the humanistic tradition for persons in authority. There can be no doubt, however, that it was notably present in the Jesuit ethos even though sometimes in tension with countervailing tendencies. By what means did the first Jesuits intend to further their goal of progress of souls in Christian life and doctrine and the propagation of the faith? In the ‘Five Chapters’ they succinctly listed ministry of the Word, Spiritual Exercises, works of charity, and, ‘specifically,’ the teaching of catechism to ‘children and unlettered persons.’ The bull Regimini echoed this list but with the addition of striving for ‘the spiritual consolation of Christ’s faithful through the hearing of confessions,’ a sacramental dimension missing in the original draft. The subsequent bull, Exposcit, expanded that last provision to include ‘the administration of other sacraments’ and then indicated further works of charity, beyond teaching catechism, that had emerged in the ensuing decade as noteworthy – ‘reconciling the estranged ... devoutly assisting and serving those ... found in prisons or hospitals, and indeed performing any other works of charity, according to what will seem expedient for the glory of God and the common good.’ The primacy the first Jesuits assigned to ‘ministries of the Word,’ as well as its correlate, the hearing of confessions, indicates how neatly in that regard they fit into the pattern of ministry set by the great mendicant orders of the Middle Ages, especially the Dominicans and Franciscans. The list begins to diverge from the pattern with the mention of the Exercises, a form of ministry created by Ignatius with no precedent in the other orders. That ministry invited people to an inward journey and provided various road maps for making it, including in its most elaborate form a withdrawal for a month from the distractions of life. Although the practice of retiring from one’s ordinary circumstances for reflection and meditation is older than Christianity itself, the Exercises was the first book to organize and codify procedures in a practical, organized, yet flexible way. In effect, it created a new ministry in Christianity, the spiritual ‘retreat,’ and the promotion of that ministry helped contribute to the Jesuits’ self-definition and style. What the Jesuits meant by ‘works of charity’ was the seven spiritual and seven corporal works of mercy, which were in large part elaborated out of the famous Last Judgment scenario in Matthew 25. One of the spiritual works was ‘teaching\n\nxxviii\n\nIntroduction\n\nthe ignorant.’ The first ‘work of charity’ the Jesuits specified for themselves was precisely that, ‘the education of children and unlettered persons in Christianity,’ the teaching of catechism, that is, Christian Doctrine, which sends us back to the statement of purpose, ‘the progress of souls in Christian life and doctrine.’ There is therefore circularity and considerable cohesion in these few lines of the Formula. The original grounding of the Society in simple catechesis helps explain how later, for all the Jesuits who moved in high circles, many others continued to be engaged with more humble folk in more humble pastoral enterprises. In the version of 1550, two further specifications of works of charity were added, in recognition of activities in which members had been particularly prominent in the Society’s first decade: reconciling the estranged (‘peacemaking’) and serving prisoners in jail and the sick in hospitals. The section of the Formula we have been considering clearly established the fundamentally pastoral and missionary character of the order. As I indicated, broadly speaking the Jesuits in that regard would be doing what the Dominicans and Franciscans were doing. These two orders were active in the mission fields, for instance, long before the Jesuits arrived on the scene. But, as I also indicated, a significant difference in pastoral activity was the giving of the Exercises. Another, less obvious, was the explicit articulation of the pastoral and missionary character, the more explicit intentionality. The difference points to the character of the founders, to the kind of training they had received, and thus to a different cultural context. It thereby hints at further traits that would become part of the Jesuits’ ‘way of proceeding,’ their style. The style would favour a reflective and fully articulated approach to problems and their resolutions. There was still another difference. The Formula established a commitment to works of social assistance of various kinds. In 1540, the year of the founding, Ignatius was instrumental in the creation of an orphanage in Rome and shortly thereafter of the Casa Santa Marta, a refuge for prostitutes who wanted to put their situation behind them. Although the mendicants, as well as the monks, engaged in various works of charity, for charity was intrinsic to being Christian, peculiar to the Jesuits was the explicit articulation of it as an essential element of what they were about. They were not only preachers of the Word and administrators of the sacraments, they were also, and professedly, agents engaged in the construction of institutions of social assistance. This commitment from the very earliest years would lead them into varied and intense relationships with confraternities, the institutions that by the sixteenth century undertook most of the ongoing commitments to the poor, the sick, and other groups on the margins of society such as prostitutes. In the 1550 version the list of ministries ends by commending anything that contributes to ‘the common good.’ Up to that point the vocabulary of the section\n\nIntroduction\n\nxxix\n\nof the Formula we have been considering has been directly or indirectly derived from the Bible or from traditional Christian usage. ‘Common good’ derives not from those sources but from philosophy. It appears for the first time in 1550, after ten years of experience and after Juan Alfonso de Polanco became Ignatius’s confidant and aide in formulating the official documents of the Society. The expression implies an openness regarding what might be included in the future in ‘works of charity.’ More important, it suggests, I believe, a concern for this world and its betterment, a shift away from strictly evangelical goals – the common good. The older orders doubtless had this concern and expressed it in various ways, as their histories make clear, but the up-front commitment to it in the Formula is what deserves our attention. I mention Polanco because I believe he would be more likely to think in philosophical terms than Ignatius, and also because of the letter he wrote to Antonio de Araoz in Ignatius’s name on 1 December 1551.8 That is just a year after the publication of the revised version of the Formula, in the wording of which he played an important role. In the letter Polanco proffers fifteen goals the Society hopes to achieve through its schools. The last six are various benefits for the cities or towns in which the schools are located, and the penultimate one reads as follows: ‘Jesuits will encourage and help in the establishment of hospitals, houses of convertidas [prostitutes seeking to change their lives], and similar institutions.’ In the mind of Ignatius and the others, therefore, there was a correlation between the schools and works of social assistance, with a clear awareness of benefits for the city. The last reason is even more comprehensive in that regard: ‘Those who are now only students will grow up to be pastors, civic officials, administrators of justice, and will fill other important posts to everybody’s profit and advantage.’ That goal could have been written by Erasmus, Pierpaolo Vergerio the Elder, or any of the other theorists about the program of studies promoted by Renaissance humanists. The achievement of that goal is precisely what the humanists promised by their educational program. That fifteenth reason shows how profoundly the early Jesuits had appropriated the literature on the subject, and how easily they correlated it with the evolving mission of the Society. I say ‘evolving mission’ because, like all social realities, the Society would continue to change in a number of ways. There was one change, however, that was of absolutely primary importance and that was already under way in 1550, when Exposcit debitum was published. It was the momentous impact on the Society of the decision to undertake schooling as a formal ministry, a decision first grounded in the opening of the collegio in Messina in 1548. The decision in very short order affected almost every aspect of the Jesuits’ selfunderstanding up to that moment, and gave the Society an enlargement of its\n\nxxx\n\nIntroduction\n\npurpose or mission that was at best only potential at the beginning. In 1550 this change, though under way, was still too inchoate to make its way into Exposcit debitum. At this point, therefore, we must abandon the Formula. Absolutely crucial though the Formula is for understanding the foundations of the Society, it fails to mention the ministry that would come almost to define the Society, and that in ways big and small had a transforming effect on all the other ministries and on almost every aspect of Jesuit procedure. With slight qualification, the Constitutions suffer the same major defect. They were composed at approximately the same time as the Formula of 1550 and were never adequately revised regarding the schools before their official approbation by the First General Congregation, 1558, two years after the death of Ignatius. This is a dramatic instance of how limited and misleading official and normative documentation can be for understanding a social reality. As the Jesuits had recourse to the Formula, they would get no guidance for the role the Society had in fact assumed as ‘the first teaching order in the Catholic church,’ and they would do only slightly better with the Constitutions. In the correspondence from the Jesuit curia even during the lifetime of Ignatius, it is clear how massive the commitment to ‘the colleges’ had become in just a few years, but the correspondence would not be readily available to scholars or Jesuit superiors until its publication in the twentieth century. The very momentum of the commitment carried the enterprise forward without much questioning, at least at the beginning, as to whether running schools was an authentic pursuit for Jesuits. But the evangelical vocabulary of the Formula does not seem easily reconcilable with teaching horsemanship or with writing books on rhetoric or, for sure, on dance! What we have here is a radical redefinition that was never fully articulated in official documentation and at best was only suggested in most other writings by Jesuits. What did that redefinition entail? In the first and most obvious way it entailed a shift from the Jesuits’ being essentially a group of itinerant preachers and missionaries to their becoming resident schoolmasters. For the schools, moreover, the Jesuits acquired huge properties. Despite their almost Franciscan avoidance of money transactions in the beginning, they became, in order to sustain the schools, ‘the first professional fundraisers,’ as Olwen Hufton argues in this volume. More profoundly, they initiated for themselves a new relationship to learning and the arts in the wake of their commitment especially to the humanistic program. What kind of schools were these schoolmasters operating, therefore, and for whom? Although some of the schools had the full course of studies eventually prescribed in the Ratio studiorum, 1599, which culminated in the ‘higher disci-\n\nIntroduction\n\nxxxi\n\nplines’ of philosophy and theology, they all taught the ‘lower disciplines’ of the humanistic program – grammar, rhetoric, history, drama, and so forth. They taught the program not as a preparation for theology, the traditional clerical rationale, but as a program complete in itself, with its own proper goals, that would provide laymen with the learning and skills they needed to make their way in this world. And to make their way so as to be a help to others and a benefit to the communities in which they lived. That at least was the ideal. I believe that up to now we have not taken seriously enough how this reality entailed a redefinition of what the order was really about. Or, perhaps better, how it entailed a significant enlargement and enrichment of the mission of the order. The religious mission remained fundamental, and the other missions had to be integrated into it and even subordinated to it. As an ideal this mission remained steady through the centuries. But because of the schools the Jesuits had a commitment to culture, to urbanity, to civiltà, to conversazione, and to the honneste homme in the world that was new for a religious order. That commitment is one of the great themes to emerge clearly in our two volumes dealing with the Jesuits’ relationship to ‘cultures, sciences, and the arts.’ We still tend to look upon the Jesuit schools as church schools, as confessional schools, even as Counter-Reformation schools. That indeed they were. But what happens if we turn the picture around to look upon them as civic institutions – usually requested by the city, in some form paid for by the city, established to serve the families of the city, which service entailed listening to the expectations of those families and, when feasible, making adjustments to accommodate them? They were often the leading cultural institution, especially in the smaller cities and towns. They provided library resources in an age before public libraries, and they provided public entertainment. As especially Judi Loach and Giovanna Zanlonghi show in this volume, the cultural mission sometimes burst the walls of the classroom to effect an even more pronounced civic presence. Coordinated with this social reality, moreover, was the educational theory of the studia humanitatis, affirming that those studia were the apt instrument for producing men dedicated to the public weal, to ‘the common good.’ It was this commitment to the studia humanitatis that distinguished the Jesuits culturally from the mendicant orders. Those orders, too, as their various programs of study unmistakably reveal, had serious commitment to ‘learned ministry,’ as grounded in the institutions of learning they established for their own members. But these orders were founded before the Renaissance, and their programs were already fixed before the humanists’ propaganda had reintroduced the studia in an organized and self-conscious way into the Western world. The studia were not part of the system of the Dominicans and Franciscans, though individual Dominicans or Franciscans might be proficient in them. But they\n\nxxxii Introduction were part of the Jesuit system, the first studies every member of the order undertook and the subjects that almost every member taught professionally at some stage of his career. The Jesuit commitment to the studia was thorough and systemic. There had to be repercussions. A text that every Jesuit was familiar with and that many of them taught year after year was Cicero’s De officiis – ‘On Duties,’ which I translate as ‘On Public Responsibility.’ Here is a well-known passage: ‘We are not born for ourselves alone ... Everything that the earth produces is created for our use, and we, too, as human beings are born for the sake of other human beings that we might be able mutually to help one another; we ought therefore to take Nature as our guide and contribute to the common good of humankind by reciprocal acts of kindness, by giving and receiving from one another, and thus by our skill, our industry and our talents work to bring human society together in peace and harmony’ (I.7.22; my translation). Jesuits, I opine, would easily have correlated this passage with the section opening the Spiritual Exercises entitled ‘Principle and Foundation,’ which affirms that we were created for the praise, reverence, and service of God. In the Christian context, that praise, reverence, and service, the Jesuits knew well, could not be divorced from concern for one’s neighbour. Yet the passage from Cicero is directed to the betterment of this world rather than to one’s eternal salvation. I suggest that the Jesuits saw this text as an amplification of the message of the ‘Principle and Foundation’ rather than as a contradiction of it. As an amplification, it gave the ‘Principle and Foundation’ an important new modality. It is not insignificant that the term ‘common good’ occurs in it. We must remember, these ‘pagan’ texts were taught not simply as models of style but as sources of ethical inspiration. If Erasmus could invoke ‘St Socrates,’ I think some Jesuits, if they let themselves go, could have invoked ‘St Cicero.’9 I do not know of any who did, but Cornelius à Lapide, the Jesuit exegete, said of a passage from Epictetus, ‘O wonder, these words ring of the gospel, not just moral philosophy.’10 The tradition of character-formation for the good of the city goes back all the way to Isocrates and is at the heart of the paideia that the Renaissance humanists worked so hard – and, ultimately, so successfully – to revive. I find it almost impossible to believe that teaching, day after day and year after year, the classical authors such as Cicero who inculcated this ideal did not have an impact on the Jesuits’ sense of the mission of the Society and thus on their sense even of their own vocations. Did this not give them an anchor in this world and a concern for it that, for their times and particularly in the early years, was special for clerics? Partly as a result of our two conferences I have been moving towards an affirmative answer.\n\nIntroduction xxxiii In making this point I am not trying to exalt the quantity and quality of the Jesuits’ civic and cultural accomplishments in comparison with those of other religious orders. The cultural benefits the Benedictines have conferred upon Western civilization are incalculable. The Jesuits produced no artist of the calibre of the Dominicans’ Fra Angelico. For all the importance of the Gesù in Rome, the church never had the civic significance of the Franciscans’ Santa Croce in Florence. I am not, therefore, trying to say that the Jesuits did more or did it better. I am saying, rather, that with the Jesuits their civic and cultural accomplishments assumed a new mode and were undertaken with a new rationale and a more explicit intentionality. I am saying that with the schools the Jesuits produced civic and cultural institutions that were new for a religious order and that had a more professedly this-worldly orientation in large measure because they sprang out of persuasions originating in the classical world, not the Christian world, even though they were now revived for the Christian world. I am saying that the mode of Jesuit engagement with culture in a civic context was different in that it was centred in humanistic schools. This meant that most Jesuits spent most of their day in a secular space, not in the pulpit or the cloister. This meant that they taught secular subjects – indeed, pagan literature, as well as mathematics, physics, and astronomy, sometimes botany and natural history. This meant that they taught secular students, not clerics or members of religious orders. This meant that, especially in teaching the classical dramatists, they were drawn into music and dance in ways new for clergy. ‘Ecco, i preti delle commedie!’11 This meant that by such engagement with ‘the sciences and the arts’ they shocked most notably the Jansenists, with some of the dire consequences Marc Fumaroli indicates below. If I am correct in assigning to the Society a cultural and civic mission, it means we must re-examine that most sensitive and telling aspect of the Jesuits’ reality, their spirituality. At its deepest level, Jesuit spirituality derived from the Spiritual Exercises. As a spiritual classic, the Exercises is a plastic text, open to a range of interpretations, including the highly moralizing interpretations of the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. There can be little doubt, however, that the concluding meditation on the love of God promotes a positive appreciation of all created reality. It is a longer version of St Ignatius’s exhortation to Jesuits in the Constitutions to ‘find God in all things’ (no. 288). Ignatius further exhorts them not to be afraid in their ministries to make use of ‘natural’ means as well as ‘supernatural’ (no. 814). Jesuit spirituality, as has often been remarked, has a decidedly activist, even this-worldly cast to it. I believe that this cast provided a potential that contact with the humanistic tradition activated in a cultural and civic direction. The tradition was mediated to\n\nxxxiv\n\nIntroduction\n\nIgnatius in the early years by Polanco and by Jerónimo Nadal, but it then worked its way into the very fabric of Jesuit consciousness by the sheer repetition year after year of the teaching of classical texts about civic virtue in institutions geared to the welfare of the city and its citizens. I propose that we can begin to speak of Jesuit spirituality as a civic and culturally aware spirituality. Or we can at least say that in many Jesuits their spirituality had a civic and culturally aware dimension. This was a dimension that for the most part was more implicit than explicit. It would be manifested much more by actions than by words, by what we can infer than by what we can directly verify. This dimension, almost negated by the normative documents, can be retrieved only by the kinds of studies contained in our two volumes, studies representative of the exciting turn taken in Jesuit historiography in the past ten or fifteen years, studies that have moved away from the normative to the actual. This dimension was, moreover, too much contrary to the conventions of writing and thinking about ‘spirituality’ to be conceivable until we had a more capacious understanding of what spirituality might mean even in a religious-ecclesiastical context. If by spirituality we mean something like the deep wellsprings of our motivation and the impulses within us that prompt us to make certain decisions and not others, especially as the decisions express dedication and self-transcendence, then we are here dealing with a reality absolutely critical for understanding Jesuit style, critical for understanding the Jesuit ‘way of proceeding.’ We are dealing with a reality altogether critical for understanding the Jesuits’ relationships to ‘cultures, sciences, and the arts,’ and hence for understanding in their fullness the studies contained in this volume.

Scholars in the past decade have turned their eyes in new ways to the Jesuit schools as cultural institutions. They have now begun to ask perhaps the most obvious and fundamental question: How were these institutions, some of them of great size and complexity, funded? Olwen Hufton here addresses that question and in so doing addresses the seemingly perennial issue of the ‘modernity’ of the Society, arguing that the Jesuits were the first of that profession we are today all too familiar with, that of the fundraiser. In his revealing study of Jesuits as translators, Peter Burke comes close to a similar conclusion about the modernity of the Society by seeing much of the Jesuits’ work as translators as a program of self-promotion for the Society, another feature of modern life with which we are very familiar today. But his study goes much deeper, showing how diligent at least a small corps of Jesuits were in introducing books written for one culture into another, engaging to some extent in what is currently known as ‘cultural translation.’ While such activity manifests once again the radically international ethos and sensibility of the order, it also points, somewhat paradoxically, to the grounding the Jesuits often had in the local scene and their concern for it. As Burke indicates, translations into the local vernaculars had a big impact on the development of those vernaculars, especially in East-Central Europe, where the Jesuits were especially influential in that process. The Jesuits were the only large religious order of men not to have a women’s branch, an early and adamant decision of St Ignatius. Scholars have begun to study the implications of that decision, sometimes taking as their point of departure the first and still most fundamental work on Ignatius’s relationship to women, Hugo Rahner’s Saint Ignatius Loyola: Letters to Women (Freiburg im Breisgau, 1960). As Elizabeth Rhodes here argues, from the beginning women found something that attracted them to the Society that seems to go beyond the personality of individual Jesuits whom they knew. Rhodes makes the point that it was the very masculinity of Jesuit spirituality, as codified in part in Ignatius’s Spiritual Exercises, that drew them to the Society, for on some level they realized that, as they applied it to themselves, it moved them to a more active and dynamic role than society seemed to prescribe for them. She tellingly illustrates this point, for instance, with the story of Luisa de Carvajal y Mendoza, a selfappointed missionary to Protestant England at the turn of the seventeenth century. Aspects of women’s relationship to the Society are taken up again in Part Five by Haruko Nawata Ward and in Part Six by Alicia Fraschina. One of the special features of this second volume, as we indicated in the\n\nThe Society in Society\n\n3\n\npreface, is the attention we give in Part Six to that still unwritten history of the suppression of the Society. Many factors led up to the traumatic event, but certainly among them was the diffusion and long life of a work published a century and a half before 1773, the Monita secreta Societatis Jesu. This book, the magna carta of anti-Jesuit propaganda, purported to be secret instructions from the superior general of the order informing Jesuits how they were to fleece widows, work their way into the secret counsels of princes in order to advance the nefarious purposes of the Society, and do other crafty deeds. Often refuted as a crude forgery, the book shows through its publication history that it had enough verisimilitude to tap into the fears of at least certain segments of society. Despite its importance, it had never been systematically studied until Sabina Pavone recently turned her attention to it. She provides below an overview of her research on this book, which was still being published, and presumably given credence, in the late twentieth century. Just as the Jesuits did not have a women’s branch, so they did not have a ‘third order’ for laypersons as did older orders such as the Dominicans and Franciscans. They did have, however, their ‘Marian congregations,’ which functioned in largely the same way. These congregations were essentially a Jesuit adaptation of the late-medieval confraternity and, as recent scholarship has begun to show, one of the strongest ways in which the Society of Jesus reached out to affect the society in which it functioned, especially through forms of social assistance to the poor. Judi Loach here presents a striking instance, however, of a Jesuit using a congregation as a form of ‘adult education’ to effect what amounts to upward social mobility. The Jesuits and the culture of the seventeenth century is the subject Peter Davidson explores in ‘The Jesuit Garden’ – the garden as garden, a particularly seventeenth-century fascination, the garden as a bed for exotic and newly discovered plants, the garden as expression of the symbolic mode of discourse so characteristic of that century. Davidson’s article is a fitting conclusion to this section on the Society of Jesus in society, for it suggests the harmony and good order the Jesuits saw as an ideal for society that perhaps in some measure could be achieved.\n\nThis page intentionally left blank\n\n1 / Every Tub on Its Own Bottom: Funding a Jesuit College in Early Modern Europe OLWEN HUFTON\n\nThe history of the Jesuits, as the contents of this volume demonstrate, can be written in many ways, its infinite diversity contained within no single traditional subcategory of the discipline. My involvement with the Jesuits developed in the course of an ambitious research project concerned to explore the funding behind early modern Catholic social reform initiatives. That is to say, charitable, educational, and welfare concerns designed to transform, to ameliorate in every possible sense, and to discipline society. This exploration was conducted not merely as an exercise in social or economic history but as one that pursued cultural values and constraints. The approach of the Jesuits to their major educational enterprise entailed major debates and generated self-questioning as well as an exceptionally rich and varied documentation. What follows is an attempt to make some very broad working generalizations, ones open to infinite expansion and modification, about Jesuit college funding, with particular emphasis on the comparative experience of Italy, France, Spain, and the Southern Netherlands.1 Such an exercise involves a consideration not merely of where the money came from, the question of donors or concessions made by local and national rulers, the nature, in short, of the endowment, but also of the potential and limitations of particular types of funding and the reasons for mounting debt. In particular, I shall seek to locate an understanding of the funding of colleges in the fiscal, political, intellectual or cultural, and dynastic and family history of the period 1500–1760. In so doing, I shall explore the solidity or frailty of resources by reference to the broader social and economic climate of early modern Europe. John W. O’Malley in his landmark The First Jesuits remarked very pertinently that the educational mission was not the only Jesuit mission.2 It is indeed true that a Jesuit had to preach as well as teach and to reach out to the newly colonized pagan world across the seas. However, the educational aspect of Jesuit activity could be called the mother of missions since it was intended to produce\n\n6 Olwen Hufton manpower, both for the order and outside it, as part of the grand design to transform secular society through the education of the young. In ‘De collegiis fundandis’ the first purpose, deemed to be the immediate concern, was prioritized: Because the Company’s aim and goal is travelling to various parts of the world at the commands of the vicar of Christ our Saviour, to preach, hear confessions, and show to children and other unschooled persons the commandments, mortal sins, and other foundations of our holy Catholic faith, it seemed to us convenient and indeed necessary that those who enter [the Society] be persons of good morals and some sufficiency in letters. And because people both good and lettered are few in comparison with the rest, and of the few there are those who want to rest from their past labours, most having benefices ... or important offices or other sources of livelihood ... we find it very difficult to increase the Company by such lettered persons, even good and learned, both because of the greater labour necessary in it [the Society] and because of the ... travelling even to the end of the world ... therefore it seemed to us all, desiring the conservation and augmentation of it [the Society] that we take another path, that is, of colleges.3\n\nBut this relatively restricted and arguably inward-turning goal by 1546 had been overtaken by the broader appeal to the second concern, the general education of youth. The early fathers of the Society of Jesus were to become the first systematized and urgent protagonists of the principle that an entire civil society is the product of its educational system, and that tomorrow’s world depends on the intellectual and social development acquired in youth. Legatees of the humanist tradition conspicuous in the work of Erasmus of Rotterdam,4 themselves honed in the Sorbonne and impressed by the rigorous intellectual training they received there, the Jesuits sought to improve the moral and intellectual formation of youth by encouraging the development of self-discipline and selfconfidence. Their goal would be achieved through the structured study of the classics, the humanities, and rhetoric – the art of persuasion. This was not the full extent of the curriculum content, since development occurred, but it formed the core of the grand design. A third concern related to the college was its large building, planted conspicuously in the urban landscape, where it would stand as a powerful and substantial marker of a collusion of interests between secular and ecclesiastical powers. Important for my particular story, the creation of colleges was the only aspect of Jesuit life for the sake of which members of the Society had authority to depart from their mendicant commitment to poverty and to raise money and make it work, own property, and build up endowment income. The process of doing this transformed the individuals forming the Society from mendicants to money raisers and managers, a conspicuous metamorphosis and one that involved a\n\nFunding a Jesuit College in Early Modern Europe\n\n7\n\ndifficult learning process not completed overnight. Not all members of the Society were comfortable with the process or its implications for their life mission.5 No Jesuit I have encountered in the records joined the order to keep the books. But having committed themselves to this work, they began to learn on their feet the discreet and less than discreet art of finding money and, having acquired it, of making it work. The result was the creation of the biggest network of private schools Europe has known, with something in the order of five to six hundred distributed across the Continent, though most thickly in certain regions of France, the Southern Netherlands, and Italy. In Central Europe the number of schools was smaller, as indeed was the population. Moreover, these areas were theatres of war between peoples and armies of different confessions. Even where the schools were apparently well established, their number and that of their pupils was slightly flagging in some countries by the late seventeenth century.6 This shrinkage reflects, perhaps, as well as a reduction owing to war, something of a decline in the popularity of the collegiate model. The decline was visible in both Jesuit and Oratorian colleges (notoriously Jansenist) and thereby suggests that the struggles between Jansenists and Jesuits did not reinforce the one at the expense of the other. By that date as well, the number of teaching orders had proliferated. The didactic strategies of many of the newer orders (Piarists, Salesians, etc.) often reflected some Jesuit influence on method of teaching and structured content of learning, but these orders’ schools operated on a more modest scale and were cheaper for civil authorities to fund. The Jesuit schools remained the biggest, however,7 and the suppression of the order could not obliterate the mark they made on subsequent schooling models – not least on the laicized French lycée (in terms of size and approach to learning by memory). Our point of departure must be that we are looking at a huge success story, even if one pitted with frequent financial problems that were everywhere slightly different and everywhere somewhat the same. Every college tells a story, but the plot has common themes, and among these money and debt loom very conspicuously. A basic principle informing the educational mission was that Jesuit education was to be offered free to the consumer: the Jesuits thus cut off an obvious source of revenue. Education had to be paid for, however, and the enterprise, given its scale and intensity, was not to be cheap. It is probable that the early fathers had absolutely no idea of what it might cost. They knew, however, that money would have to be courted. Indeed, it is my contention that the genesis of the Jesuit college saw the birth of the modern educational fundraiser, one instantly recognizable to the development office of a prestigious university in our time. ‘Our way of proceeding’ progressively had to include financial strategies and business management. The fathers in the first forty years of the enterprise evolved a\n\n8 Olwen Hufton mission statement that promoted an educational product so enticing and worthy as to demand consideration. It was to be attractive to those eager either to commemorate themselves or to opt for this way of fulfilling a Christian imperative. Or else the fathers offered enticements to civic governments – we can improve your citizenry, morally and intellectually, and hence the standing of your city. A recent Oxford thesis has shown that Henri IV of France, who would seem an unlikely supporter given his Protestant origins yet who probably is the royal figure who gave the most to the Jesuits, was persuaded that a Jesuit education would discipline an unruly nobility. A social transformation from a warring noblesse primed only by self-interest to one recognizing higher values and the good of church and state was France’s main hope of avoiding perpetual conflict.8 Like modern fundraisers, the Jesuits wooed the potential powerful donor by means of inducements. They targeted kings, dukes, and influential churchmen, who, in the building of a college, were offered the early modern equivalent of what development offices in our own times term ‘the naming opportunity’; the appeal was to the commemorative instinct. In Ignatius’s own words: ‘If he were thinking of leaving a monument to himself after finishing his days, it is evident that this work is quite to his purpose. It would be a great and lasting monument to his whole family.’9 The major donor would also have the title of founder, and he and his family after him would be publicly acknowledged at the annual founder’s ceremony, with its particular founder’s candle. It should be noted that the Jesuit building program followed upon an important watershed in building history. Gradually, from the mid-fifteenth century, the big donor came, as it were, out of the closet, and accepted the public renown that followed the construction of an elegant building for a recognized public good. Discreet generosity (let not thy left hand know what thy right hand doeth) was an outmoded virtue in the modern baroque world. The magnificent man, in the Aristotelian model, left a visual record of his presence in the urban landscape. This development was fundamental to the Jesuits’ building endeavours.10 The great donors, however, were tardy to present themselves without assurance that they were backing a winning program. Like a modern development office, the Jesuits from the 1540s sought to construct networks of supporters starting in the Celestial City itself and, perhaps most significantly, initially among the Spanish ambassadorial community. Court groups were obviously crucial in the long run, and success in one Catholic court, given the mobility of any supporter, could lead to developments in another. These networks have been neglected in Jesuit studies, but without them the mechanics of expansion cannot be fully understood. The group at the Palazzo Madama around Margaret of Austria, for example, progressively endorsed Jesuit aims while indulging their\n\nFunding a Jesuit College in Early Modern Europe\n\n9\n\nown Spanishness with sermons in their language and the services of Jesuit confessors.11 In time, more complex sociability patterns developed that bound supporters together and moved them to work for targeted ends. These supporters (whom we would call the ‘friends’) were supplied with information specially tailored to evoke their confidence and enthusiasm, such as carefully edited (so as to preserve the enthusiasm) letters from distant Jesuits recounting developments. As the colleges took on more form, certain events such as spectacles, special sermons, and the celebration of canonizations promoted the cohesion of groups and a sense of togetherness. School performances played a particularly important role in enhancing this sentiment while also imparting spiritual information.12 Reciprocation of favours, where possible, occurred. Finding consonance of interests and creating networks lay at the heart of the business of successful fundraising. In seeking patrons and founders, the fathers were located in a hierarchy of relationships with important families, some of whom constituted the civic government, whose input also mattered. Togetherness was of the essence. It was also important to manage money, once acquired, to the best effect. This included both borrowing and lending at interest, and the question of at what levels this could be done taxed some of the early fathers considerably. No one thought more about the morality of money management than Juan Alfonso de Polanco and Pedro de Ribadeneira, who were seriously disturbed by the high levels of interest paid on loans in the 1560s, levels which could reach 20 per cent as governments issued bonds and became heavily involved in deficit funding to cope with the expenses of war.13 The friars still defended a prohibition on usury, but once again the Jesuits had taken the more modern line. Nevertheless, as Polanco’s agonized comments reveal, they were uncomfortable with levels exceeding 6 per cent. As borrowers they could not afford such levels, but as lenders (for both processes occurred concomitantly) they were also offended. As lenders they preferred to invest with the Monte di Pietà, which was safe and below market rates and which generated money for helping the poor. How could colleges become a reality? Where could they start? The early band conceived of the colleges in terms of a trinity of actors – first, rulers or the ruling secular and civic elites of important families, and second, ecclesiastical authorities (princes and bishops), both as donors, along with themselves, finally, to oil the works. The lines between endowment and building costs were not clearly drawn in their minds, and the fruits of their persuasion of big donors were slow to materialize.14 The start was very hard. The Jesuits were unknown entities, and lack of papal support in the tough formative period of the Carafa years (1555–9) was a handicap. So, in specific Italian contexts, was the predominantly Spanish constituency of the early fathers.\n\n10\n\nOlwen Hufton\n\nA working model, and one that in the long run turned out to be the dominant model in western and southern Europe, was offered to the Jesuits in 1551 by the Spanish viceroy of Sicily, Juan de Vega, who met Ignatius through his wife, Leonor Osorio de Vega, in the Palazzo Madama circle. In this model, a civic government (prompted by a king, duke, etc.) invites the Jesuits to open a college with a specified number of classes requiring a specified number of teachers, and provides a residence, classrooms, and running costs. The City of Messina to Father Ignatius Loyola Being well informed that in the congregation of religious of the name of Jesus, which is under the direction of Your Reverence, there are persons of learning and virtue, who by doctrine and apostolic ministry make themselves of great use in the Christian state, this city wishes very much to have some of your subjects to teach, preach, and produce the same fruit that has resulted from their labours wherever they have resided. As it were to actuate the desire of the citizens, Our Lord has condescended to place over them as Prince and Viceroy Juan de Vega, who, with that piety, prudence, and virtue conspicuous in him, has approved our supplication to Your Reverence [my emphasis]. Our request is that you send us five masters to teach theology, the arts, rhetoric, and grammar and another five to pursue their studies and give assistance in works of Christian zeal. The city will furnish them with food, clothing, and a residence suitably furnished: and in order to execute our will in proper form, the citizens have considered it in council and given it their unanimous sanction, to which is added that of His Excellency, the Viceroy.15\n\nThis is a critical text in the history of the Jesuit college, and it offered the way forward to secure financing. Where the civic government would raise the funds is not detailed, but its own revenues from indirect taxes and deficit funding can be assumed. The endowment is thus a form of public funding, but – and here we must look at the actual Sicilian model – gifts will follow and will permit a building program. Private funding thus intrudes. In due course, de Vega himself and his wife built a college at Messina, and other members of the family at Palermo and Bivona. In short, there was a development – a building program that followed the establishment of funds to ensure running costs and short-term buildings. The Jesuits themselves were expected to work with ruling dynasties and generate gifts from individuals who had been converted to the plan, and thus would accelerate the building of the great college that would grace the urban landscape. The success in Sicily (a specific story involving Spanish elites who were office holders and generals) was impressive, but Sicily was an offshore island and did not fundamentally forward the grand plan. The big cities, first Rome and then Florence, were the main targets and were to prove difficult to crack.\n\nFunding a Jesuit College in Early Modern Europe\n\n11\n\nThe de Vega model involved one long-term problem arising from the (in)flexibility and nature of municipal funding; I will return to this issue. In the immediate term the problem was actually to secure the initiative of a ruler or dominant official that made local and national governments open to a process of negotiation. The unknown early Jesuits used the not always successful technique of sending in representatives to preach and pave the way to an accord through a supportive local network hoping to promote the desired end. They usually approached a well-disposed highly placed contact. This strategy could run into difficulties: if the ruler and civic government did not respond, the Jesuits and the local support group they had constructed could seek to accelerate the process by borrowing money for renting premises and starting a fledgling school. However, unless an official accord promising regular support followed, they could be left in a very embarrassing state. The Spanish historian Antonio Astráin graphically describes how the pilot teams could become victims of their own enthusiasm by placing too much store in the promises of individuals, and how negotiations could break down during the process of obtaining permission to start from Rome. Gifts could be disputed by the family of the donor – for example, gifts that proved to be covert attempts at tax evasion by being postponed until after the death of unborn generations of heirs. One early lesson had to be the discernment of the real offer. The worst situation occurred when the early pilot group tried to stay on and had to find interim funding for themselves and the classes they had begun. In Spain (and also in the Southern Netherlands) the local friars contested the times at which the Jesuits might preach and, by extension, appeal for gifts or raise a collection. They claimed a monopoly over peak attendance hours at mass and were sustained in their claim by Pope Paul IV. The stranded Jesuits could find themselves obliged to appeal to the parents of the children they were teaching, thereby undermining their own credibility, since they had promised education for free.16 The problems were not confined to Spain. The disasters in Ignatius’s lifetime at Modena or even Ferrara taught the Jesuits to get an agreement with the civic authority before opening a class, or at least to have obtained some security from a patient and affluent donor to tide over the enterprise. The dreadful state of most of the thirty-two initiatives, totally precarious at the time of Ignatius’s death, provided cautionary tales ranging in focus from the absolute necessity of being able to guarantee teachers enough food and rest, to the need for written evidence of committed donations. From the 1580s the Jesuits became strict archive keepers so as to have a documentary base from which to confirm their possessions.17 On Ignatius’s death, Diego Laínez closed a handful of the weakest colleges and shifted the members of their depleted staffs elsewhere. His decision thereafter never to go in without an accord with civic authorities and never to accept a\n\n12\n\nOlwen Hufton\n\nscheme for fewer than two hundred pupils made sense, if only it could be achieved. It was not always possible to keep to such principles, however, in warravaged regions or where reconstruction of a Catholic educational base took place in politically difficult circumstances. If the Jesuits never sought to build colleges where the national ruler was hostile, still in the 1580s they could find sections of civic elites, as in the Southern Netherlands or eastern or southern France or Rhenish Germany, overtly antagonistic. Moreover, in Central Europe their progress was constantly jeopardized by religious war until the mid-seventeenth century, and even civil authorities who welcomed the idea of a Jesuit presence lacked the means to support it. It is very difficult to point to a specific moment at which the Jesuits entered upon easier times. Furthermore, the de Vega model was not always adopted as the sine qua non in places where the Jesuits believed they were dealing with significant frontières de catholicité.18 It would seem, however, that in Italy a major break was certainly the advent of Pope Gregory XIII (1572–85), who identified the Jesuits as an important agency in Catholic reform and was prepared to build the Collegio Romano and to find for it a benefice income sufficient to constitute a plausible part of an endowment. In 1553, Ignatius gave Polanco several reasons why the Roman college was the most significant of all the colleges: first, when established it would attract many pupils to all disciplines; second, the city of Rome was in need of reforming institutions (buone opere); third, the college would operate to the benefit of Italy generally, where universities left much to be desired, by attracting good international professors who could teach in the Parisian model; fourth, the glory of the college would reflect upon the Apostolic City, whose intellectual and moral status needed a boost; fifth, the college would provide the pope with talented and capable people to serve the church, and missionary priests for the heretic and pagan lands. It would also serve as a model and competent authority for other colleges. A very important consideration must be that at the court of Rome were present princes, ambassadors, and bishops, who, witnessing success, would be inspired to found similar institutions in their own countries (as patrons). Finally, Ignatius pointed to the Roman institution as critical to the formation of preeminent Jesuits serving as leaders in other colleges; by their efforts excellence would be reproduced, and the single model, one capable of operating in all social environments, would be endorsed.19 Polanco needed little convincing, but the initiative was rent by broken promises and defaulting. First, Pope Julius III (1550–5) had promised an annual 1,500 scudi to help build and endow the college (insufficient but something, and from the right source). He delayed in spite of a petition from six cardinals and died before anything was handed over. The next pope, Paul IV (1555–9), gave nothing to the new institution. Francisco Borja, who on entering the order had\n\nFunding a Jesuit College in Early Modern Europe\n\n13\n\nplaced about 5,000 scudi with Ignatius to refurbish a church and buy some houses to serve as a novitiate building, instructed his heirs to pay the Jesuits 1,000 scudi per annum to help endow the college. There were problems in transmitting this inheritance, and Philip II opposed the outflow of Spanish money to Rome. In 1552, debts stood at 1,200 scudi.20 Ignatius was actively searching for a founder among noteworthy ecclesiastics and reached a certain stage of agreement with the bishop of Sora, Tommaso Giglio, one of the most influential ministers of Cardinal Alessandro Farnese. But the bishop had his own agendas, offered insufficient money, and insisted upon the founder’s title.21 Ignatius held back, knowing that once the ‘naming opportunity’ had been ceded the big donor in search of Aristotelian ‘magnificence’ would not come forward. The difficulties did not lessen in times of war, and the clerics at the college lived on alms for much of the 1550s and were decimated by fever. Cardinals and popes over the next decades were strapped for funds. The usually hopeful Polanco summed up the situation to Jerónimo Nadal in June 1561: ‘The difficulty is to know where to apply.’22 Over the next twenty years, a new builder-donor was found in the Marchese de Tolfa, who was the widow of Camillo Orsini and was intent upon erecting a building in his memory. But relationships between the widow and the Jesuits did not run smoothly. Their demands exceeded what she was prepared to give.23 The denouement of the thirty-year saga was that Gregory XIII became the major builder and endowed the college with an abbey in commendam, Chiaravalle, worth 6,000 scudi a year. After a long haul in which tenacity and Ignatius’s unshaken belief that in spite of setbacks the college would come about, the flagship Collegio Romano at last acquired some solidity – at least for the next eighty years or so. The Tridentine movement also created a new generation of bishops prepared to endorse and to help, and by the early seventeenth century there were active secular as well as ecclesiastical elites, not only in Italy but in France and the Southern Netherlands, prepared to embrace education as a way forward. If the financial history of the Roman college has some distinctive actors, the problems it experienced in its formation were replicated almost everywhere, and its ensuing history of debt accumulation likewise is typical of lesser institutions. The financial history of early modern Europe is one of shortage of specie and ready money. The wealth of kings was far from flexible and was caught up in wars and in the rewards and pensions system for their supporters. They themselves wanted to borrow, and in the second half of the sixteenth century they did so at astronomical rates (up to 20 per cent), which made borrowing difficult for others. It was a tough money market, in which there were winners (the lenders) and losers (the borrowers). The Jesuits had expected that their major donors would be great princes,\n\n14\n\nOlwen Hufton\n\nwealthy dynasties, and ecclesiastics seeking commemorative building projects. They were to discover that, in fact, only a very few among those groups could or would generate the means. The reasons in large part are attributable to the nature of inherited wealth. The wealth of great men, expressed in inherited land, was tied to the next generation; the incumbent was merely an agency through which family wealth passed in a clearly demarcated system of entail. Every father of a family knew the limitations of his disposable wealth. The part of an individual’s estate that could be designated new wealth – that accruing from office, pension, or favour or made in speculative investment, from having charge of state business, for example, or the handling of the silver ships, or from generating deficit funding for the government, or from colonial position, or as a result of military involvement or naval campaigns or investment in mercantile activity – was in a different position. Even then, family costs such as the marrying of a daughter could erode the proceeds. In short, the big donor was usually childless and in a position to draw upon new wealth. Some bishops who embraced Jesuit ideals after Trent were honoured as founders (for example, Guillaume du Prat, the bishop of Clermont, at Billom and Paris). But most, though childless, had family obligations in that they were responsible for restoring investments made by their families of origin to secure their promotion. Nor were all bishops rich, especially in southern France, where the Avignon popes had split dioceses and their revenues as a way of multiplying supporters. Moreover, for some grand churchmen who wished to make a statement of ‘magnificence,’ building or refurbishing a church was seen as the best statement of all.24 Most post-Tridentine bishops were also eager to associate their names with the founding of a diocesan seminary. In short, there was an embarrassment of causes to support. Not all liked the Jesuits, and in Spain the heavy presence of the old mendicant orders in the episcopate also accounts for a holding back there. It followed that the ecclesiastic was generally more likely to be part of a consortium of donors to a college and to be recognized as founder by agreement (rather than as a result of having contributed the largest sum) to the building or endowment. Individual bishops of the Southern Netherlands eventually became deeply involved and proved ingenious in providing sources. Gérard de Groesbeek at Liège in 1580, for example, may serve as an illustration. He considered that the income from a benefice left vacant for twelve years (not the same benefice, but six benefices for two years or four for three) would accumulate sufficient funds to endow a college.25 In the late sixteenth and early seventeenth centuries, a number of rulers embraced the ‘naming’ or commemorative opportunity (Henri IV at La Flèche, for example, or Duke Albert of Bavaria at Ingolstadt). These great flagship\n\nFunding a Jesuit College in Early Modern Europe\n\n15\n\nbuildings were perhaps the exception rather than the norm, and many rulers were allowed founder status when their contribution was in fact relatively small and the main burden of financing the building had been assumed either by a consortium of donors or by someone prepared to forego the status of founder. An outstanding example of such a renunciation was at Ferrara, where the widow Maria Frassoni del Gesso put up some 70,000 scudi against the miserable 1,000 loaned by Duke Ercole d’Este, who nevertheless was given the founder’s title. The Jesuits saw the ruler’s name as lending an aura of distinction to the college, and as serving to encourage further gift-giving by those who sought association with initiatives of the ruler. In fact, association with a particular ruling dynasty could be crucial for sustained support. Much can be learned from certain early ventures in which women committed themselves to Jesuit college building,26 since they reveal an eagerness on the part of the Jesuits to recognize their contribution and at the same time an anxiety to grant the honour of founder status to men. For the Jesuits in the early days, a window of opportunity in the dynastic stranglehold on family wealth was offered by the widow. Sixteenth-century great families could put up to a fifth of the value of their estates into dowries as a way of creating links with other great families; the interest on the sum provided a usufruct enabling the bride to meet her living costs. In widowhood the whole sum could become hers to reappropriate. It was expected that such wealth would pass to her children or, in default of issue, back to her family of origin on her death. But the widow could leave a will in another direction, or use the income on her wealth freely. The extent of her power to do so varied according to national laws. Venetian and Bolognese women seem to have had more control over their resources than did Florentine or Roman women. The potentially wealthiest sixteenth-century aristocratic widows were Spanish (and this included those of Naples and Sicily) because they controlled not only their dotal wealth but 50 per cent of all new wealth accumulated after marriage by their husbands. A number of trends are to be noted. One is that wealthy women were supporters of the early fathers, and that their assets figured largely in the funding of pioneer forays to promote the establishment of sixteenth-century colleges. There were a number of women founders in the early days, but fewer later on, as families began to guard themselves by active litigation, or to push for legislation, restricting the amount of money widows could bestow on a religious order.27 Or, in some cases, husbands gained more control of these considerable resources. Here we approach the question of the competition for women’s money. Litigation over the deployment of widows’ resources by anxious families threatened to blacken the Jesuit name and contributed to scandal.28 One is struck by the disappearance of women’s names over time. But it may be deceptive: ways\n\n16\n\nOlwen Hufton\n\naround prohibitions could be found, and noticeable is a shift in widows’ giving post mortem to annuities established in vivo, where the woman makes her investment from her dotal funds (and regards it as a gift) but receives an income in her lifetime. In every college the construction of endowment income had to be carried out quite separately from the meeting of building costs if the institution was to survive. The triennial reports on the financial state of the house relate only – and in very broad terms – to endowment income and to expenditure; the nature of the debt is described generally, and the reader is accordingly left with tantalizing questions. How much debt came from repairs to buildings, for example?29 Each college, as the recipient of designated gifts or civic income, had to be a tub on its own bottom.30 Civic support in the dominant model was usually in the form of an agreed percentage of indirect taxes sometimes bolstered, especially at the beginning, by further concessions from the national ruler (notably from the profits of justice of bankruptcy cases), or, as in the case of Henri IV and his successor, by revenues from forest rights or the gabelle. It was expected that civic concessions would be topped up by gifts, and that many such gifts, cumulatively, would enhance revenues to the point where civic endowment could be reduced. If such was the expectation, as at Lyon, it did not happen. In a mature portfolio, endowment income contained land, which could be a direct gift, or could be purchased from the sale of other forms of gift, or – and perhaps most likely – could come into Jesuit hands as part of the concession of a Benedictine abbey in commendam. Land was less the dominant form of income in Europe than in Central and South America, though it could still represent the most valuable element in the post-suppression valuations. Theoretically, land attached to a benefice in commendam gave the Jesuits control of some good agricultural land, tithes, and seigneurial dues, but from the income had to be deducted the cost of a priest for the benefice, the upkeep of any ecclesiastical buildings that were part of the benefice, and sometimes the maintenance of the remaining resident Benedictines themselves. These last were invariably resentful, and claimed neglect of the upkeep of the fabric of the church and monastery. Such dissent could result in a withholding of revenues.31 Some benefices, however, were very profitable. They usually generated grain and were the source of the s"
