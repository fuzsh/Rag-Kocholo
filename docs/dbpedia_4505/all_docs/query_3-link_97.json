        "text": "If you ask Mudbugs coach Karlis Zirnis if it’s been a hard week, he would strongly agree with you as the Mudbugs won at George’s Pond 3-2 in overtime over the Amarillo Bulls on Saturday night.\n\nThis was the third consecutive overtime game for the Mudbugs this week.\n\n“Oh yeah, all week every game is overtime,” Zirnis said.\n\nThe Mudbugs have clinched a playoff spot but are battling for home ice in the first round. Zirnis isn’t looking at the standings, though.\n\n“We’re obviously trying not to look at the standings,’’ he said. “That can get you in trouble. We are just trying to focus one game at a time, one period at a time. Just simple as that. This is behind us, learn from it, get better at it, and go back to work on Monday and focus on the game on Friday.”\n\nThe Mudbugs could not shake the pesky Amarillo Bulls, who they swept for the home series this year. An overtime game-winning goal from Gueorgui Fedulov sealed the 3-2 victory.\n\n“I just stayed in front of the net,’’ Fedulov said. “I looked for the shot, tipped it, and then broke his stick, and then buried it. It’s always nice to win in regulation, but we come together so well in overtime.”\n\nFrankie Melton made the sole goal with a wrist shot from the left wing to give the Bugs a 1-0 lead at the end of the first period. The goals lead could have been bigger but the referee disallowed a goal at a little over 2 ½ minutes into the first period for not allowing the goalie to play position. The Bulls seemed to focused on taunting Mudbugs’ Dominick Procopio towards the end of the first period.\n\nTensions rolled over from the first period to the second period as Amarillo kept trying to target Procopio. Procopio and Amarillo’s Matt Nehl’s came to blows to give each player a five-minute major for fighting along with a 10-minute unsportsmanlike conduct.\n\nAmarillo’s defense stood strong as the Mudbugs pounded Bull’s goalie Nikita Babinstev with 19 shots. Shreveport couldn’t light the lamp, though.\n\nWith a little more than 3 minutes remaining, Amarillo’s George Mika took advantage of a flying save by Shreveport’s John Roberts as the puck deflected off of his pads to give the straight shot to the goal and knot the game up at 1-1 to end the second period.\n\nIn the third period, Amarillo was plagued by penalities as it gave the Mudbugs three power play opportunities in the period.\n\nOn the first penalty, Shreveport took advantage as Jackson Hartje grabbed the opportunity to score early in the third period and regain the 2-1 lead. Amarillo’s defense continued to stop the Mudbugs. Shreveport looked to have the game in control until 5 minutes remained when Nestor Plarsmo slipped one past the right corner of the goal to tie the game up 2-2 and send the Mudbugs to their third overtime game of the week.\n\nThe Bulls continued to find themselves in the penalty box even in overtime as Alex Truscutt received a tripping infraction. Amarillo’s defense stayed strong again and survived the power play in the shortened period. The Bulls defense was not strong enough as the puck deflected off in front of the goal at the right time for Fedeuolov to get the game winning goal in overtime."
