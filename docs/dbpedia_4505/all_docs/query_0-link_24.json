A literary critic with a clear style and valid observations, Maya has studied the works of writers within Colombia, from Hernando Dominguez Cemargo, the colonial poet, to Leon de Grelff (1895), a contemporary lyrist who began the march of the vanguard writers in his native land. Maya has also written critical studies of writers from other countries, such as Cervantes, Goethe, Hugo, Garcia Lorca, Santos Chocano and Juana de lb arbour ou. Frequently, he is called upon to give the 1 keynote address at conventions end festivals where he captivates the audience with his lucid presentations and logical development of the topic under discussion. Nor Is his mastery of literary principles confined to theory, for he began to write poetry as a young man, and throughout his life he has been faithful to the Inspiration of the Muse. The latter aspect of Maya's life, that Is, his con­ tribution to Colombian letters In the field of poetry, has been chosen as the theme of this dissertation, not because his labor as a teacher, critic and orator Is Inferior, but because the attention which his lyrical works have received In the United States Is not consonant with their merit. As early as 1925 Jean Cassou, the eminent French critic, in reviewing Maya's first collection of poems, La vlda en la sombre.1 remarks that \"M. Maya a une faclllte extra- 2 / ordinaire.\" Mariano Picon Salas, the Venezuelan critic, Immediately recognised the potentiality of Maya whose \"vos ... es entre todas las voces nuevas la qua parece 1 Rafael Maya, kf Yfr*l fB 1* (Bogota: Cromos, 1925). 2 Jean Cassou, \"Sobre La vlda en la sombra.\" Revue de l'Aaerloue latine, X (Aout, 1925), 159. « % mas clara y segura.\" In 1928, the year his second book, Coros del nedlodfa. was published,* another French critic, Georges Pillament, In his review, prophesied the develop­ ment of a gift possessed by Maya which would blossom with maturity after he had tasted more of the sorrows of life. He commented that It did not matter that he did not have an exact knowledge yet of life and its creations, nor if his experience was superficial because \"11 y a en lui des dons qua, nous l'esperons, se realiseront.”5 The passing of the years has not diminished Rafael Maya's prestige. In 1944 the Brazilian, Mario Mendes Campos, characterizes Maya as \"uma excelsa voz da poesia colombiena, portador de excepclonais dons de sabedoria, serenldade estetica e aguda percepcao da beleza ... ^Mariano Picon Salas, \"Uh nuevo gran poeta de Colom­ bia: Rafael Maya,\" Atenea.

More recently the Bolivian critic, Femendo Dies de Medina, calls Maya \"uno de [los] mas preclaros lngenios\" of Colom­ bia, creator of \"el verso terso, nltido, perfeeto ... Dies de Medina laments the tardy arrival of Maya's poems to Bolivia— \"pocos, pero puros, radlantes, lmagen fiel de A la mas noble poesla.\" Angel Martin Sarmiento, C.M.F., a Spaniard who has written several articles about Maya's poetry, calls it a \"magnifies obra ... produceion llterarla de un tan gran maestro\" in which he found \"tesoros lnsos- 9 pechados.\" Significant, also, is the inclusion of Maya among world-renowned writers in the Lealkon der welt- llteratur im 20. Jahrhundert.10 Although it may seem superfluous to note the reception Maya's poetry has had among Colombian critics, such as Baldomero San In Cano, Jose Umana Bernal, Javier Arango Ferrer, Nicolas Bayona ^Fernando Dies de Medina, \"Figures de America: Rafael Maya, poeta de Colombia,\" Bolivar. XXXIX (Marso-Agosto, 1955), 745. 8Ibid., p. 746. 8Angel Martin Sarmiento, C.M.F., \"Carta a Rafael Maya,\" Bolivar. XXXVIII (Enero-Abril, 1955), 629. 10T^rikon der weltliteratur im 20. Jahrhundert (2 vole.; Freiburg: Herder, 1961), II, 413. Posada, Eduardo Caballero Calderon and Carlos Arturo Capa- rroso, it Is significant that so many of them place him among their outstanding contemporary writers, as Leon de Greiff and German Pardo Garc£a (1902). Why, then, has so little attention been given to Rafael Maya in the United States? Is his poetry good, but not great? Has he remained aloof from the main stream of life, or is there a universal scope to his philosophy? Is there a distinguishing quality in his lyrical works that sets him apart from the ordinary poet? Can the problem of which Diez de Medina complains, that Maya's works were slow in reaching Bolivian readers, be applied to readers in the United States as well? Is there a reticence among students of Latin American literature to discuss the merits of a living author? Has too slight an emphasis been focused on the contribution of Latin American writers in recent times? Certainly, the answer to the last three queries is \"No.\" All of Maya's works, both prose and verse, can be located in the United States, although his poetry has re* calved here far less recognition in anthologies and articles than it has in other countries. Federico de On£s does Include \"Capitan de velnte aHos\" from Coroe del medio- die In hie anthology published four years ago In New York.11 And \"Alla lejos,\" accompanied by an English trans­ lation by R. Hays, is incorporated into an Anthology of ggntfflffgrtry p9 ? m by Dudley Fitts.12 Five poems recited by Maya have been taped for the Hispanic 13 Section of the Library of Congress in 1962. These in­ clude \"Bn las prlmeras horas\" from Coros del medlodla. \"La esplna,\" \"La mansion abandonada,\" and \"Recado a mis , 14 amigos\" from Navegaclon nocturne and \"Sangre\" published In the newspaper, El Tiemno. of Bogota.15 But this is 1XFederico de Onfs, ed., Antologla de la noesla esoa- nola e (1882-1932) (New York: Las Americas Publishing Company, 1961), pp. 1013-1016. 12 Dudley Fitts, ed., Anthology of Contemporary Larin American PQetrv (Norfolk: New Directions, 1942), pp. 442- 445. 13 Francisco Aguilera, comp., Index of Genres and Tonics to the Beading in Spanish by selected authors from the Library of Congress Archives of Hispanic Literature on tape (Washington: Library of Congress Reference Depart­ ment, 1962). ^Rafael Maya, Navegaclon nocturne (Bogota: Librerfa Voluntad, 1958). 15E1 Tiampo (Bogota), Sunday, May 14, 1961, Section II, p. 2. inappreciable in comparison to the poems of and articles about Maya found in periodicals, such as Poesfa df (Mexico), Renertorlo americano (Costa Rica), Ateneo de Honduras. A&gagg (Chile), and Revlsta chilena and antholo­ gies originating from Spain and Argentina.^ The studies devoted to Octavio Paz (1904), Clro Alegrfa (1909), Pablo Neruda (1904), Jorge Carrera Andrade (1902), and Jorge Luis Borges (1900) among many others prove that American students do not hesitate to consider the works of living men. The vast number of books, articles, theses and university courses in the United States dedicated to the examination of their writings attest to the growing realization of their value. This dissertation proposes to answer the questions posed on page 5. By examining closely all of Maya's poetry, 1 shall try to discover his greatness, and illus­ trate how he matures from the young imitative writer to the independent thinker. By a thorough scrutiny of his lyric production 1 hope to show that his provincial educa­ tion does not make him unaware of universal human probleois 16Thesa entries will be Included in the bibliography in order to be of service to those interested. nor that the confines of a small country like Colombia do not limit his thinking in terms of all mankind. I shall endeavor to demonstrate the support and validity that his meter, imagery and diction give to his poetic thoughts. In order that this study be systematic and that its conclusions be valid, Maya's six collections of poems will be the primary source of my investigations. These books include, La vide en la sombre, seventy-eight poems of diverse form and theme, Coros del mediodfa. a compilation of nineteen poems considered by some to be his masterpiece, Despues del silencio.17 six poems in dialogue averaging over three hundred verses each, Final de romances v otras 18 canclones. eleven poems, four of which are written in ballad form, Tiempo de lux. 7 a collection of fifty sonnets and his last book of poems, Navegaclon nocturne, a compila­ tion of one hundred one poems of varying meter and rhyme which climaxes Maya's published poems to this time. 17Rafael Maya, Despues del silencio (Bogota: Editorial Minerva, 1938).

Before undertaking the examination of Maya'a poetry, it aeema relevant to give a brief sketch of hla life in order to focus his poetic creation in the proper perspec­ tive. This sketch, with a brief description of the edi­ tions of his poetry, will conclude the introduction. Usually a poet has set ideas about poetry. If he does not have a theory per se, he may reveal these concepts throughout the course of his poetic production. When asked about poetic theory, Maya disparaged those poets who first offer \"their aesthetic ideas,\" but whose theories are more Interesting than their application. He suggests that a poet not speculate about his art but dedicate himself exclusively to its creation leaving the exegesis for 20 others. Although Maya has no theory, as such, about poetic creation, he does state or suggest in his poems various thoughts about this art. Chapter II will be a discussion of thesa ideas as an aid to a better under­ standing of his art. Is there a unique quality in Maya's poetry as he 20 Rafael Maya in an interview with Julio Aguirre Quintero, \"El pensamiento de Rafael Maya,\" Bolivar. XIV (Jullo-Septleobre, 1961), 190. 10 progresses from youth to maturity. Is Maya constrained by the limits of a colonial Colombian town or is there a universal dimension to his work, is there a distinct character, and an original flavor In his treatment of imagery which would attract readers beyond the confines of Colombia? Chapters III to VI will attempt to answer these questions by treating each one individually, illustrating by the philosophy contained in his poems, the themes treated, the moods expressed and the artistry exhibited that the poetry of Rafael Maya deserves greater recogni­ tion. Chapter VII will be a resume and evaluation of the matter considered in the body of the paper. Biographical Sketch of Mava Since Rafael Maya is not widely known in the United States it seems fitting to mention something about his life in order to facilitate the analysis of his poems. Poetry is affected and influenced by one's early years, his edu­ cation, his activities and his accomplishments. Maya's works reveal this fact. The poet was born in the colonial city of Popayan, 11 Colombia, on March 21, 1898.^ He racaivad hie secondary education In the Seminary of Popayan and studied Law at the Unlversided dal Cauca of the same city and at the Uni- versldad Nacional in Bogota. With regard to his education Maya says: .. • yo soy un autodldacto y ml cultura tlene tramandas lagunas porque en mi tiempo no hab£a donde nl como hacer estudios organlzedos de ninguna especle (me reflero a los estudios llterarlos y humanlsticos), y ten£a uno qua entrar fatalmente a la facultad de Derecho o a la de Mediclna. Yo perd£ muchos anos sobre los codigos. En el Seminario de Popayan tuve algunos rudimsntos de huma- nldades, es declr, el conoclmlento fragmentarlo de al­ gunos autores latinos, pero eso, no obstante lo elemental de la enseSanza, me ha servido touch£slmo posterlormente.

As early as 1919 two of his sonnets had been published in Costa Rica, \"Fatum\" and \"De mas alia,\" which had appeared , 24 earlier in Cronos (Bogota). These two poems were in­ cluded in his first published book of poetry, La vide an By 1929 he held the post of rector of the Escuela de Bellas Artes in Bogota, and through the years he has been a professor of literature in many colegioa of the same city. In 1941 he was elected dean of the School of Human! - 25 ties in the Unlversidad Javerlana. It is only natural that having held positions of this nature for so many years that he would be designated with the affectionate title of ntftr? by his students. 23 Ortega Torres, p. 935. 24 , Repertory ffltrjcano (San Jose, Costa Rica), I (Febrero, 1919), 23 (de Cronos [Bogota]). 2^\"Rafael Maya, Decano,\" Revista de las Indlaa.

Many of these discourses have been published In magazines and In 1941 they were collected In a single 27 volume. The speech that he gave In Call during the fes­ tivities commemorating the centenary of Jorge Isaacs' birth was Incorporated under the title, \"Jorge Isaacs y la reall- dad de su espfritu.\" Others Included were \"Vlda, muerte y resurrecclon de una cludad,\" given In Manlzales to honor the founders of the city, and \"La Iglesla, la Bucarlst£a y la cultura,\" delivered In Medellfn at the Inaugural assembly of the second Colombian Eucharlstlc Congress. Another address Included In this collection Is \"Un sfmbolo* de America\" which he delivered In Bogota at the unveiling of the monument erected there In honor of Jose Santos Chocano. \"Popayan de Belalcazar\" given In Maya's native city during Its fourth centenary celebration also appears In Alabansas ...

In addition to the unswerving dedication of Maya In his role as writer, educator and orator, he has also served his country as cultural attache of its embassy in Chile, as representative in the House in 1947 and as director of the National Radio between 1948 and 1951, where he directed a series of cultural programs. He founded and directed the magazine Bolivar. the official organ of the Ministry of Education and also the Biblioteca Popular de Culture * Colombiana from 1951 until November of 1955 when he was nominated delegate to UNESCO in Paris. Maya returned to Colombia after several months in Europe in the early part 29 of 1958. Among the honors that have been accorded him are the title of Doctor of Philosophy and Letters, Honoris Causa, and the signal privilege of being an appointed mem­ ber of the Colombian Academy of Language and a correspond­ ent of the Spanish Academy.

Much o£ his time Is spent among the books In his library where he meditates and writes. Julio Aguirre Quintero gives this admirable description o£ him: ...

El ambiente es exceptional: inslnua el dlalogo e Invlta a o£r la viva palabra cuyo mag is ter lo ha ennoble - ddo con tanta generosidad tantas conciencias.

It was common to see him standing and conversing animatedly with his students on the cypress-lined walk of the campus during my seminar there. The poet is very self-assured and this confidence Is evident In his tone of voice and manner of speaking. He Is very young for his sixty-seven years. His taut complexion and his dark, though thinning, hair belie his age. His hand clasp is firm and cordial, and his 30 \"El pensamiento de Rafael Maya,\" Bolfvar.

The Poetry of Mays Rafael Maya had Initiated his lyrical career several years before his first collection, La vlda en la sombre. was published in 1925. The sonnet \"Fatum\" was published in Cromos and in Repertorio «m«rie«nQ as early as 1919,31 and was printed in the Revlsta chilena in 1921. \"De mas alia,\" another sonnet, also appeared in 1919* In 1924 Repertorio americano published another poem of Maya, \"Vol- r 1 34 verte a ver [sic].\" Since the publication of his first poetic compilation, Maya's poems have been included in numerous newspapers, reviews and anthologies. Less extensive-'nineteen poems— but excelling Maya's first collection in quality according to the judgment of critics within and out of Colombia is Coros del\" medlodfa.

Only four poems have asso­ nance. Of the remaining fifteen only nine have a set meter of mixed heptasyliable and hendecasyliable verses. After a decade Maya published his least extensive production, Desoues del silencio. This Is comprised of six dialogued poems averaging over three hundred verses each. Maya shows daring In his combining meter and rhyme within the poems. \"Rosa mecanica,\" the most varied, contains stanzas of five, six, seven-eleven, ten-six, eleven and twelve-syllabled verses with perfect and Imperfect rhyme, couplets and free verse. In 1940 these three books of Poame--La vlda en la sombra, Coros del \"t*119*^1 and Desoues del silencio— were published simultaneously In Poesfa.35 Four years later when a second edition of Poesfa was published It also Included Final de romances v otras can- 36 clones. The 1944 edition of Final ... contains eleven 35 Rafael Maya, Poes fa (Bogota: Llbrerfa Voluntad, 1940). ^Rafael Maya, Poes fa (2a ed.; Bogota: Llbrerfa Volun­ tad, 1944). 18 poems, four of them with octosyllabic meter and assonance In the even verses. The remaining seven varied between sonnets and poems of hexa-, hepta-, hendecasyliable or Alexandrine lines. Tiempo de lux was the first collection of Maya's poems to be composed entirely of sonnets. It contains fifty In the original edition, forty-nine of which are Included in the third edition of Maya's complete works entitled Obra poetlca.3^ This edition represents thirty years of Maya's poetic production, and the repeated print­ ings attest to the favorable reception his work has re­ ceived. Once again in 1958 the edited poems of Maya were re- 38 published.

It Is the most extensive of his collections numbering one hundred one poems with a predominance of aasonantal rhyme and a predi­ lection for seven-eleven and eight-syllabled verses. These books are enumerated here only by way of an Introduction and a more adequate description of them will be given In the course of this study. In a letter dated May 15, 1964,^ from Rafael Maya to the present writer he says, \"Publlcare pronto dos llbros, uno de poems■ ... Thus, Navegaclon nocturne will not be the last collection of Maya's poams. CHAPTER II MAYA’S POETIC THEORY XaiPlratlcm of the Muse Throughout the centuries £rom the tine of the Dia­ logues of Plato and the Poetics of Aristotle, the Ars Poetlea of Horace, down to the Art poetioue of Boileau-- a link of the ancient past with the present— and T. S. Eliot's On Poetry fly1 great minds have focused on the problem of poetry, its definition, content and tech­ nique and on the poet himself. Rafael Maya is no exception in this matter, although his ideas are not collected in one essay but appear throughout his poetry. This chapter will be devoted to presenting these ideas in order to have a further criterion by Which to judge the value of Maya's poetic works Many critics have termed Maya a classic, and his ad­ herence to the custom of the classical poets of regarding 20 21 the Muse a* the source of poetic Inspiration Is one aspect In which Maya conforms to this category. In the poem with which he Initiates his first lyrical works, La vlda an la sowbra. Maya professes his creed in her. \"Credo” begins: En cade hora, an cede minuto silencloso de ml vlda da hoy, de ml vlda paseda, se conflrma ml credo lumlnoso. Creo en vosotras, Musas ... 1 So Maya believes In the Muses, these \"Musas perfeetas, cares ... claras,\" who have entwined a garland of fresh myrtle and blossoming laurel around his brow despite his 2 brief spring. The poet has tread the wine press and now he says: busco con mas amor vuestro sereno arrimo, vuestra pot ante eglda. (Vlda. p. 10) The poet recognises that the Muse has treated him bene­ ficently, infusing him with the gift of lyrical creativity. Now he looks for her serene support and powerful protec­ tion, and he begs: Rafael Maya, Obra noetlca (5a ed.; Bogota: Editorial ABC, 1958), p. 9. The five books of this edition, which was used for this study, will be referred to henceforth with the abbreviations: Vlda. Coros. DPS (Pesnues del silanclo). and Lui. p. 9. Sedme, Musas, proplcias. and in return Yo labrare mis suenos a la sonbra del tr£pode colmado de priiplclas, del arco en que vlgllan los numenes rlsueHos. Sere £lel al dlctado de vuestros lab los, armonlosos de abejas, algun d£a he de morlr al pie de vuestro pllnto yo, cantor engendrado en la alegr£a, ... (Vlda, p. 10) Thus Maya begins his poetic production, cognizant of the fact that much of a poet's work is pure inspiration--the result of the goodness and bounty of the Muse. In return for her aegis, \"vuestra potente eglda,\" he will spend his days faithful to her promptings, and, satisfied that he has responded to her whisperings, he will die happily at her feet. Maya does not advance too deeply into La vlda an la sombra before he pauses to advise the \"alada Musa,\" in \"Exhortacion,\" not to run after the applause lavished by others, but to seek for pleasure in everything she sings of, just as a mirror is satisfied looking for nothing more than the gracefulness with which things discover their own beautiful reflection looking into the clear depths of the mirror. Furthermore, Maya bids the Muse to rejoice daily 23 in the miracle of the newly-born world, and to praise the divine marvel of life— life that is humble, sad, silent 3 and good. He enjoins her not to search for some vague desire in superfluous rhetoric that suffocates the soul, but to say everything with clear words, damp with her spirit, which bring an aura like that of the primeval morning. And lastly, he urges her to meditate vastly on the deep mystery 4 which envelops mankind. Maya'8 exhortation urges lyrists to find satisfaction in their work, recommending them to look for inspiration in simple things, expressing thei elves in sxmple language while fortifying the creative act with meditation on the mystery of life that surrounds them. The Poet Just as poetry cannot exist without the inspiration of the Muse, inspiration cannot exist without the poet. Maya has many observations to make about him, his audience, his isolation and his rejection. He waits until the 3£Ldft’ pp. 34-35. 4Ibid.. p. 35. 24 publication of his third collection of poetry, Desouas del sllencio. before presenting his public with the dramatic dialogued poem, \"La crucifixion del poeta,\" whose very title discloses the fact that Maya considers the poet a victim rejected by the world. Throughout the course of this poem of two hundred eighty-two verses the poet hangs dying, and one by one a child, a man, a woman, the crowd and the earth speak to him. Of those surrounding him only the child addresses him kindly, calling him \"amigo de los ninos,\"^ almost canon­ izing the poet when he speaks of his \"boca bendlta.\" The townspeople on the other hand accuse him, charging him with being \"el mortal lmp£o que fue os ado a revelamos la in- mortal belleza ... \"** And the woman complains: Tu, ... contabas con destrulr ml domlnlo sobre los pueblos, y sobre el alma de los hombres, y aun sobre el Instlnto de la bestla. (DPS, p. 191) The poet cries out from his Ignominious death-bed and explains that he suffers on that Inaccessible rock because, having fulfilled his fatal destiny, he robbed the Rhythm of the flower that blossoms in the eternal mansion of 5PPS. p. 191 6Ibld.. p. 191. 25 the gods 7 But the poet is not completely forsaken In his hour of agony. Earth speaks up and calls him his son. He likens this son to the substance of seeds and to the nature of water, saying that he is blessed with the same quality as metals, and filled wiia the spirit which breathes over the void its germinal shower. Maya, using Earth as his mouthpiece, explains that the poet grows like seeds, purl** fies like water, constructs with the metal of his poetry, 0 and fertilizes the world with his verse. The woman then returns to the scene and calls the poet a spinner of words, a buffoon dressed in bells, a builder of ladders, and a maker of nets to rob and capture divine things. The people call him the Lord of Rhythm and Prince a of the Word. And the man who has been forced to r d him ascend the steep hill of his agony suggests that he might be an unknown king, a lord of some mysterious isle, an in* habitant of the boundless heavens, or the tranquil monarch of hell. And finally* he calls him the anonymous redeemer of the world.10 7 , DPS, p. 192. *IUd. 10Ibid.. p. 196. 9Ibid.. p. 194. It takes little Imagination to see that Maya has drawn an analogy between the death of Jesus Christ on the cross and the lot of the poet in his role among man. The poet whose task it is to bring \"immortal beauty\" to man is con­ sidered \"impfo\" and \"osado.\" The woman, scorning his efforts, derides him. His only comfort comes from nature who is about to welcome him into its bosom and from a child--\"Have you not heard that out of the mouths of babes and sucklings comes forth perfect praise. Leaving this poem temporarily and moving on to a son­ net entitled \"Acaso\" in Tiempo de luz. one perceives an entirely different mood. The poet describes couples in love who wander in the country, and he warns them that there is always a poet lying in ambush who will divulge their secret in song. For the poet listens with genteel care to the whispering indiscretion of a chance poem in the multiple voice of the universe. And then in some transi­ tory strophe, perhaps, he will narrate the happiest part 12 of their existence. Taking the ordinary occurrence of life, a young love, Maya wishes to show that the poet lW XXI, 16. 12Lua. p. 337 will often choose e simple event to eleborete in a poem. Thus, here, these lovers become unwittingly a source for his poem, and he involuntarily publicises their secret. In Navegaclon nocturne Maya speaks not so much of the individual poet nor of his ubiquity but of his contribution to the whole of poetics. In the poem \"Conclerto\" he says that each poet brings but one note and one single song to the world of poetic music. Bach poet is a chord which gives a distinct sound in the concert of the Immense cre­ ation. And all together these sounds or notes form that powerful voice which universally resounds like the choir of God. Therefore, he bids the listener not to look for the universal meaning of the total vision in a single verse nor in but one diapason. For a single poem transmits but a fleeting gesture of the indefatigable spirit which is the unity of love. But, he counsels, all songs, from those when the first dawn plucked the strings of its lyre to those of the present day, must be united in order to dis­ cover in them, with distinct tremor*, the diverse stories 13 of a single heart. In this poem Maya means to say that 1 ^ Rafael Maya, Navegaclon nocturne (Bogota: Llbrerfa Voluntad, 1958), pp. 114-115. In referring to this book in the future the abbreviation NN will be used. 28 each poet has something unique to shere with humanity, and that it is only the harmonious unity of each one's note that creates the perfect, integral concert. For whom does the poet write, create? Who listens to him? What will be the tenor of the reception he is given? In the romance. \"El hues pad canoro,\" from Final da romances v otras canciones the poet draws an analogy between the poet and the \"ruble perla del alba\" who invades the house in the early morning and fills it with song. After having hopped or flown from room to room, he is chased by mother, nurse, children and gardener until at last he finds refuge in the great outdoors. He flies above the house and fades away to something less than a speck in the abyss. Now no one listens to his warbling in the vast heavens--that warbling which that very morning had filled the house with 14 joy. The ecstasy of the uninvited bird, which swelled in the Intimacy of the hearth but is lost in the broad spaces, is like the joy that a poet disperses with his song: As£ es tu amor ioh poata! Solo vale en la serena 14JUfHL pp. 269-272. quletud de tu hogar pequaSo, entre los tuyos, en medio de tu gente y de tus campos. SI los sacas al espaelo y al vasto mundo lo arrojas, so plerde entre la Injurlosa frlaldad de seres y almas qua llenan calles y plazas, o^en la sorda noche lnmensa, mas alta qua las estrellas. (Final, pp. 271-272) According to Maya the poet's work Is valued only In the serene atmosphere of his home among his family, In the midst of his people and his country. If It Is cast to the vast world, It Is lost among the coldness of the creatures who wander through the streets, or it Is swallowed up In the Insensible night more removed than the distant stars. The deprecating remarks of those surrounding \"La crucifixion del poeta\" have been mentioned. Returning to this poem the reader finds the crowd pressing near, chiding the poet for his self-imposed Isolation and asking why he did not descend to their midst and eat his bread from their table so that his song and his Images, with their obscure allusions, might be clarified for them. Thus his song could have filled their cups and flowed through the reed 30 used for the simple music with which they mourned the tender sorrow of their deily lives. But, they continue complaining, everything in his poetry was emblematic and everything in his language was a formula grafted in a world of vague suggestion. He sent out the radial messages of his spirit from one tower to another, far above their simple mentalities.15 Maya speaks for the common man who is eager for a draft of poetic ambrosia but who is deprived of sating his thirst because so much is mysterious and enigmatic in poetry. The poet, too, feels the isolation which separates him from the ordinary man and he cries out, \"jOh, soledad del alma! / Oh, infinita tristesa de ir cantando / humanamente solos, / isolos bajo la noche quo se ahonda / con un rumor de estrellas ignoradas!\"1* In the Introduction to \"La crucifixion del poeta\" the people who have followed curiously after the poet to wit­ ness his cruel end make this stinging remark: 15PPS. pp. 194-195. ^\"Bajo la noche,” Vlda. p. 48 31 iCuan Miserable esta! La tlerra mlsma qua acepta las escorlas de la noche, hublerase negedo a sepultarlo en su seno. (DPS. p. 187) The very earth that accepts the offscourlng of the night would refuse burial to the poet. This idea of the utter rejection and abandonment of the poet upon the cross appears in \"Clamor,\" a poem of the later years of Maya in NgYmg*.on nq&tma- But here one does not feel the com­ plete desolation that the poet portrays in the former poem. For although in \"Clamor\" no one comes to administer to him, he suddenly sees e plant of health blooming at his feet which lifts up its flower like a rare goblet and offers him a nectar of a pure, delectable flavor. And he adds that this nectar is love. And so, completely satiated by this draft the poet is able to cry out, \"I commend my soul after this terrible agony into thy hands, oh sacred, eternal Poetry.\"*7 Thus the awful dereliction that a poet may suffer in his younger years seams to have been alleviated. For everyone knows that events take on a new dimension as one matures and that love tempers many a heartache. PP* 76-77. 32 Once again In \"La crucifixion del poeta\" the woman deplores the self-imposed isolation of the poet When she remarks: Y tu pasaste, sin mas compaSera qua tu sombre, diciendo palabras dulces pero axtrafias. (DPS, p. 189) Not only is the poet exclusive, but his language is incom­ prehensible to his audience* Poetry Tfcng ,#qd. Plggf Qt fotfPiWion Night seems to be the favored hour for the moments when inspiration inundates the poet. Several of Maya's poems Incorporate this idea. In the sllva \"Caller\" from La vlda en la sombre the poet asks his companion to be still for they have talked all afternoon. Now he wishes to be filled up again, drop by drop, with mystery. He desires to be penetrated with the silent star of memory. This is the hour that the angel of night hovers around everything. And if the poet is responsive to the prompt­ ings of the nocturnal atmosphere, at the first instant of dawn he will be able to recount the message of the night-- 33 the marvelous working of silence on the soul. The Idee thst the poet receives his Inspiration at night recurs In \"Canto del hoobre cautlvo\" from Coros del mediodfa. That Is the tine when the poet recollects him­ self by the light of his lamp, and he feels as secure as a child who has closed the French doors of his bedroom on a windy night. His dreams grow beneath the benign light. Outside night sifts Its Impalpable ashes upon the timid brow of the world. Within the poet thinks. The entire universe Is reduced to a band that binds his temples. And then his nocturnal cogitation becomes universal conscious­ ness. Remote voices sing within him, and there springs up In his spirit a dawn In whose light seraphs of fire are purified. Like dew on blades of grass, pearls of words form In him as well as buds of expression In whose center the germs of the world mature. Streams of light fertilize his being and he blossoms Into golden flowers. Each word that Issues from his mouth, lost among men, swells In the night like a bright echo. His poetry, stained with the color of the earth, free as the wings of an arrow, pierces the broad starry heart— night. The night watches over his 19 solitude, and he also keeps vigil. Thus, elded by the mjrsterious quality of night, man gains accessibility to the mighty grandeur of the universe and his thoughts germinate Into flowers of song. The refulgence of the infused light Is so great that even the burning angels can be refined in it. And the echo of the poet's lyre travels with the ease of a released arrow into the center of night and ex­ pands In the vast silence of the starry vault. Inspiration must be snatched when the moment Is oppor­ tune. When does it come? According to Maya in \"Inspira- clon,\" not when the messenger of God fills his head with a fever of perfect images, nor when he casts a golden arrow to awaken the heart sleeping upon the hard rock of sorrow, nor in the hour when, triumphantly, the will awakens, capable of conquering, with one sole cry, the entire cre­ ation. Nor does it come when the blood of divine beasts flows through his body and the messenger gives the poet a semblance of nature, nor when the herald lifts the poet's mightiest powers to the ultimate sphere and his spirit 19Coros. pp. 164-167. foresees e vest respiration of stars. This Is not the moment when the poetic announcement arrives, but When, naked in Infinite, Insensible, human misery, the poet trembles without discerning his own fear, like the withered leaf which forebodes the hurricane at the 20 first breath of a light breeze. Poetic inspiration, therefore, comes not when one most expects it In periods of great exhilaration, or triumph or sorrow, moments when one Is regaled or comforted, but, when stripped of all hindrances, the poet's soul is prepared to respond to the first gentle stirrings of the breath of poecic inspiration. There is not only a time for inspiration but also an atmosphere, a place and a season. In the sonnet, \"A los abuelos difuntos,\" in Ticmpo de luz the provincial cemetery deigns to lend to the poet substance for his lyrical creativity. Speaking to his ancestors whom he venerates, the poet tells them that amid the sorrow that his memory effects he goes choosing words for his songs at the foot 21 of each tomb. What the ordinary layman might consider subject for sad reflection, the poet finds a rich source 20NN, pp. 111-112. 21 L u z. pp. 335-336 36 £or his ingenuity. With regard to the atmosphere conducive to the poet's task, Maya states that there is nothing better than grey for meditation. He affirms that the sun melts the mind, and that the rude brightness of the day kills the mystery that should encompass the poet so that the Muse, a daughter of darkness, may come. When the sun sinks its dart into one's skin, he continues, the demon of sensuality begins to roam. And the darkest desires of the fatal beast return to one's blood from the forest of Pan. Besides, he adds, light is the enemy of all hidden good. The sun paints, emphasises and Improvises his mural in each fragment of air, wielding a daring brush. But the soul meditating in the penumbra engenders its celestial order— ideas that are like stars and which begin to gyrate, following silent 22 orbits, through interior solitude. This is an interest­ ing idea that Maya puts forth and might explain why the poet considers the night hours the most productive of inspiration since the tropical Colombian sun might impede his activity in the daytime. 22\"Cris,\" NN, pp. 89-91. 37 The season for poetry may be spring, or summer or autumn but not winter. In the early part of his career Maya asks in a poem entitled \"Mi verso,\" \"A donde ire mi verso ... ahora que las hojas comienzan a rodar? ... jA donde ira ... ahora que las eves se alistan a emigrar? ... iA donde ire ... ahora que la brisa no quiere per** fumar?\" And he answers that his poetry, like all things 23 in nature, will die of an \"exquisito mal. But just as spring follows every winter, when the grass begins to stir beneath the cold ground, his poetry will return to sing of the ever-recurring joys of life. It is a poet's clever manipulation of language that makes poetry what it is, gives it its distinctive quality and sets it apart from prose. Maya, speaking on this sub­ ject, addresses the morning lark in \"Salutacion\" and says, \"Mi voz con tu retorica universal confundo. / La palabra es un vino mejor cuanto mas viejo, / pero en cada una de ellas debe mirarse el mundo / cual si por vez primers se asomara 24 a un espejo.\" The vocabulary the poet wields in 23Vida. pp. 33-34. 24Ibid.. pp. 20-22. 38 fashioning his lyrics should have a universal appeal* avoiding novelty and singularity. Seasoned words* chosen with care* should be used to reflect with accuracy the image of the idea the poet has captured and wishes to share with his audience. Maya reiterates this idea of clarity in language when* in \"Babel** from Navegaclon nocturne, he indicates to the poets that their language has become confused. He asserts that they erected soaring towers* placing verses one on top of another* like huge stones* with the purpose of reaching the very stars. But suddenly their efforts ceased* their tools stopped* and confusion burst forth in hundreds of languages. Later the poets became scattered over the face of the earth. Maya recalls in \"Babel\" that in the early days poets utilised only direct words that went to the heart of things* like a delicate dart. In those days God spoke in the ear of the lyrist* and the heavens were like a book which clearly showed the hidden face of the entire creation on open pages. The relations of the soul were in perfect accord with beings of nature and fellow creatures. Murmur­ ing bees were the rapid messengers between the poet and nature, competing with the engels. If a voice or a chord vibrated In the spaces, the bees responded In unison with a secret palpitation from the minute petal to the burning stars. In early days the firmament followed in rapt atten­ tion the slow agony of the birds or the death of the grass. The twilight died imitating the color of autumn leaves. But pride accompanied the work of the poet. Little by little words took on almost a divine awareness. They forgot their lowly origin, and they bestowed on themselves a regal air, casting aside their sandals and maiden's sash. Poets failed to subdue them. How the feathers of mytho­ logical birds flew! How they erected dwellings of foam and pearls, with towers in the clouds and foundations in the mist! How they enjoyed ascending in strange raiment, riding \"clavilenos\" of dust and wood! And how they desired to forge a fantastic soul which defied the stars with its wings of white wax! Then the breath of God blew and a scene of aimless gestures and unintelligible grimaces followed. Confusion reigned everywhere and a tremendous babbling altered the song of the harp into a cacophony of voices. And from that time poets have not understood one another. 40 Locked In a double prison, the prison of the poem end that of the poet's spirit, the devices they employ to be comprehended are useless'-useless the bonfires that they send from hilltop to hilltop, futile the antennas they put in the wind, and even the letters the homing pigeons carry at their necks or the anagram that each tree wears oh 'Its bark. Before terminating ''Babel\" Maya tells the poets to mourn the death of their divine knowledge which formerly united the terrestrial orb with the star-studded sphere. Their message approaches with a false brightness now, and it is only a tenuous reflection of that old consciousness which at the Inspiration of God burned like a gigantic torch.^ Maya, an eclectic who has never been identified with any \"-isms\" and who would not concur with poets who are exaggerated in their concept of poetics, complains in \"La crucifixion del poeta\" of the lyrist whose language is enigmatic. He repeats his plaint in \"Babel\" where he draws an analogy between the descendants of Noah and the modern 25!2L PP- 130-135 41 poet8. The former presumptuously attempted to build a tower reaching to heaven and were prevented In their scheme by suddenly speaking In different languages, unable to understand one another. Maya reproves the poets for allowing pride to govern their activity and falling Into the same fate as the citizens of Babel. Thg&fi. Is a poet restricted In the subject matter of his poetry? Do certain topics lend themselves more readily to lyrical compositions? In one of the poems of his early period Maya enumerates those \"vain, useless and absurd things\" that he considers suitable for a poem. In \"Bajo la noche\" he explains to his companion, who does not like his poetry, what he considers appropriate: esa ansla indefinible de exquisites ternuras. Ese vivir sonando en un amor mas alto y claro, como un extasIs. Esa trlsteza vaga por todos los palsajes, el deseo premloso de vivir en la forma pasajera, de perpetuar la gracla en solo un gesto y aprIsloner la fuga del Instants. 26Gen., XI, 1-9 42 Esa clamor que vlene de tan hondo, por algo que perdure en le vleja mud ansa de loa seres. Aquella pledad inmotivada de las noches hermosas, cuando es tan claro el clelo como el alma que escucha, de rodillas, las vagas confidenclas del ablsmo. Las lagrlmas suaves que lloramos, a veces, en la noche por nuestra juventud y por los ojos de una mujer lejana que ya no hamos de ver. Y la lnefable santa melancolfa de los atardeceres que nos lienan de una luz celestial todo el pasado. (Vlda. pp. 46-47) It will be noted that almost nothing that Maya mentions In this passage Is tangible--dreaming of a higher, brighter love, a vague sadness for all the countryside, preserving the gracefulness of a gesture, Imprisoning the fleeting moment, sweet tears that we shed for our youth, and the melancholy of a dying afternoon. He Is faithful to this directive In many Instances throughout his poetry although he does not limit himself to just these Ideas or feelings. In \"Invltaclon a navegar\" from Coros del roedlodla the poet tells us that he whittles a reed In order to sing of old sorrows and future deceptions. Both the past with Its memories and the future with Its surprises capture the fancy of the poet and are considered appropriate themes 43 27 for hia poetry. 9f-?PfttEy When the word, nature, la uaed In the heeding It ref era to the lntrln8lc power of poetry, the quality and e88ence that la an Integral part of It according to the Interpretation that Maya glve8 It. In the aonnet, \"Flor y poema,\" the poet recalla a day years ago when he marked the favorite paaaage In a collection of poema with a flower. Time paaaed and he had forgotten completely about thl8 Incident, being taken up with other booka and Intere8t8. But In a reminiscent mood one day he was thumbing through the anthology and chanced upon the marker which he dis­ covered was perfectly Intact. Despite the passing of time the flower had not faded because the poem knew how to In­ fuse It with Its eternal freshness.Poetry, when It has been conceived In humility beneath the fecundity of the night and dressed in clear, direct language, has the unique quality of sustaining life because It shares Its vivifying faculty. In the same book, Tiempo de lug. Maya compares life 27, Coroa. p. 141. with poetry in the eonnet \"Vide y poes£a.\" He observes that at tlines one can devise in the fields, beneath the sun which scorches the grass, a trace of green on the slopes which is fed by an underground stream. So, too, wherever a poem stealthily treads, spring Imprints its sign. Each verse reverberates on a stalk, and rhythm rises high on a flower. Years and verses are joined in genteel alliance. An analogous cadence continuously moves a poem and hope. A strophe begs for the rhythm of the heart, and existence, like a verse, is measured with Immortal syllables.^ Maya makes life and poetry intertwine and exchange attributes. Poetry, as in a former poem, has a life-giving quality. Where the song spreads its roots, flowers spring up and they in return engender poetry. And life, usually measured by heart beats gives her cadence to the poetry, accepting in return the rhythm of its song. Poetry is also imperishable and infallible according to Maya. In \"Correspondencies” the poet compares verse, accents and rhyming words of poetry to the incarnation of Vishnu, so that if the former should perish they would 29Luz. p. 327. 45 return to life egaln me avatars who continue In space end in consciousness. Like them poems will continue or, at least, return to renew life. Maya also states that poetry is Infallible, and in order to substantiate his claim he points out to what scientists affirm as the cause of wind— the balance and equilibrium of the atmospheric conditions. He asserts that this is not the cause at all but what \"la infallble poesfa\" suggests--'the cries of men suspended on high, the choruses and hymns of ancient priests and liturgies, the song of reveling, the voice of vengeance, the prayer of the people, the supplication of the field, the cooing of the birds, the white symphony of the water, the blow of the bellows, the manly hymn of the hamsers, the plaint of the cattle in unison, the untiring elytron, the sonorous insect, and above all the echo of the illustrious harps, the flute, the rustic fifes and the three-winged horn. All these sounds in the atmosphere, which are captured by the leaves of the trees and in the blades of grass, are the cause of the wind. Thus when the poet passes through the woods, 30Lu*. pp. 339-340. 46 and the wind begins to blow, shaking the branches, a uni­ versal concert swells up and he hears that divine music o£ man, the music of the earth, more sublime than the mechani­ cal sound of the spheres. This Is the Infallible message 31 of poetry. Vitalising, Immortal and unerring--this Is how Maya has described poetry. In addition he says that although things may be surrounded by a vague poetic atmosphere, an air of blue sighs that encircle them ceaselessly, they also possess a nucleus— a prison of pure essence--where life reveals the mystery of Its origin. The important thing for the poet to do Is to look Into their center where the occult resides, the pure force which Impels them to help themselves In the eternal rotation, reinforcing the links 32 of the universal chain. Mature and the Poet Throughout the course of his life Maya has linked various creatures of nature with poetry to bring out the potential that the latter possesses. The poem \"Salutaclon\" 31\"Vlento,\" NN, pp. 68-70. ^\"No busques, poeta ... ,\" NN, pp. 80-81. 47 quoted above mentions the mutual power of the lark and poetry. Speaking to the melodious bird the poet says to him: Slentes qua hay en el inundo una armon£a secrets tin apaclble ensueno y un mlsterloso encanto qua preslente el poets mientras tu lo adivlnas, buena alondra, en el canto. (XiSg, p. 21) The simple creature and the poet perceive the secret har­ mony, that peaceful fantasia, that mysterious enchantment that the common man either overlooks or misses. They possess that tremendous ability to reach beyond the ordi­ nary and pierce the less comprehensible. In the poem which Maya dedicates to the stars, \"A las estrellas,\" he calls them \"palabraa lumlnosas\" and \"Ideas lnmortales.\" Since words and thoughts are the main tools with which a poet forges his product It can be Inferred that when he speaks to the stars, he Is speaking to the Instruments he uses. He says that they are serene rhythm and concordant music above the terrestrial chaos and above the Insane confusion of our souls. And he asks what effect our ancient denials would have against them or what power a fleeting thought conceived on earth could muster against the eternal brightness In which they bathe or against 48 33 the pure silence In which their perpetual light shines. Luminous words and inmortal thoughts dwell In the heavens shining like stars, Immune to the confusion on earth. They are the products with which the poet works and nothing earthly can have any dominion over them. Maya likens the poet to streams In \"Oda a las fuentes\" from Navegaclon noctuma. He sings to the rivers--the beneficent, everlasting currents. To all of them— those that begin In the depths of the high mountains, those that leap In white foam carving with their lightning flash the excavated rock, those that descend through the deep chasms In rapid turbulence carrying their music to the highest branches of the trees, those that are formed drop by drop In the age-old caverns, spilling over with the urgency of a filled amphora, those which receive their existence from some evanescent cloud that does not pass without sending Its refreshing dew on a torrid night. In fine, he sings to all the streams, large and small, hidden or exposed.3^ And he adds: 33Vlda. p. 103 ^NN, pp. 105-106. 49 Como ellM [1m fuentes], tu, poeta, de la cantara da tu paeho sac as el agua pura del cantar, qua siempre ae funde con el r£o da 1m lagrlmas. (MS, p. 105) Like the rivers and streams, the poet takM from the tree- t sury of his breMt the pure water of song and shares the joy of it with the sorrowing world. PgEpongl. Rgftotigng. pf_Mgyg Rafael Maya began his poetic production under the aegis of the Muse, shared his advice with fellow poets, discussed the position of the poet in the midst of his fellowman, the time and place of his inspiration, the sub­ ject and language of poetry, its peculiar quality and essence. But before leaving his IdeM concerning poetic creativity, I should like to examine a few thoughts he shares with regard to his own personal experience as a poet. It is a well known fact that many men who begin a career brilliantly do not always end so magnificently. It would have been more advantageous for their eternal glory to have been cut off in their prime so that their con­ temporaries would have to conjecture their unattalned 50 greatness. This is the thought that Maya presents in \"Si hublese muerto\" in lu». He says that if he had died when he was only twenty someone would have compared his existence, for its fugacity, to sweet spring. And perhaps, an unfinished poem, severed in a verse, in the height of its emotion, on summing up his youth would have told the total avidity which pulsed within him. This destiny, according to the poet at about fifty years old, would have been preferable to a white old age filled with glory and to the bronze at the end of his road. For the word \"never,\" for sole insignia, would eternally lift up his memory with the beauty of a truncated column.^ Does this mean that Maya realizes that the potential with which he began as a young man, when he showed signs of being a great poet, never fully developed? Not neces­ sarily. He could be echoing the sentiments of an acquaint­ ance, repeating another's thought or suffering a moment of melancholy which every man endures when he does not fully appreciate his own talent. On the other hand, he could be lamenting the lack of recognition accorded him in his ^~*Luz. p. 338. 51 maturity In comparison to that received In his younger years. Another sonnet, from the collection just mentioned, reveals more Insight Into the functioning of this poet. In \"Temblor” he says, \"Pues ya no brota ml canclon como antes, / no asegurels que el manantlal ha muerto.\" Beneath the arid sand of the desert a thousand refreshing streams course. The poet admits that he does not now surrender his only good (his poetry) to the delirious winds nor to the open horizon, that uncertain tremor which iden­ tifies stars with lovers, that tremor, called poetry, which measures the rhythm of the cosmic harmony like an Infinite pendulum, a tremor which he manifests in his spirit which Is flame, wind, a storm or a shout- and often immortal 37 silence. In his maturity the poet, tempered by the years, does not cast the song of his lyre to the open air as before. His music which has been a burning, rushing, violent and anguished strain now concedes, at times, to be immortal silence. In Wavaaacion nocturne Maya likens his poetry to a globe and to a river. This \"Globo\" of his poetry ^^Luz. p. 346 37B>i4. 52 vacillates through the ether o£ the hours between night and day, constantly attracted by these two poles. And like his verse, he says, his heart and the world endure these 38 two distinct forces. The river of Maya's poetry, unlike a normal stream, does not rush over its bed to spill out and join other waters. It flows in reverse, retracing its steps and 30 returning to its source. The water of his poetry, having streamed from its source in the direction of the sea of life, now that it is reaching the end of its course gladly returns to the source from which it received its being. Death has never been far removed from the thoughts of the poet, but in Naveftacion noctunu Maya leaves a message for his friends which makes the reader of \"Recado a mis amigo8\" feel that the poet senses the imminence of death. He instructs his intimate friends with regard to his burial and the inscription to be engraved on his headstone. The poet reminds them that he has never been an ascetic, nor a soldier, nor a farmer, a blacksmith, nor a sculptor, but that he devoted his life to watching bees 38NN. p. 56. 3*\"Mi poes£a,\" NN, p. 44 53 fly about, interpreting their music, and the secret of their hives. This is where his art has resided and here his knowledge rests. Nevertheless, he has tried his faith­ ful epic on \"greater things,\" such as always noting how the telegraph wire, if grazed by a swallow, sings in the wooden posts. He has also followed the route of a red ant when it studiously encircles, as if drawing a meridian, the green sphere of a pear. And he has faithfully recounted the agony Which glorifies the withered leaf, trembling on a tree and burning like a star. In order that he might enjoy his final rest, he be­ seeches his friends to lay on his breast or beneath his temples a beautiful book of poems--a book where his only passion is mentioned— the earth with its water and rocks, the abundant harvest, the black mountains of pine and the golden valleys of oatflelds. He wants a book of moisture and oxygen because he wants the verses to exhale their beneficent quality and deeply penetrate him with the pros­ perous fragrance of the soil as the sun after a storm en­ velops the earth in the mist of a manorial kitchen. Thus his passing will be but a new life where his body will share the vegetal existence. And he hopes that the 54 palpitating nerves of his body will be like grasping claws 40 which maintain it ever united to the great maternal womb. Although Maya has not been exclusively devoted to writing poetry in his life, this poem reveals how important he considers this avocation. In order to insure transition from life on earth to its continuance, resting in the bosom of earth, he requests a book of poems that had its origin and inspiration in the land toward which he goes. Returning to \"La crucifixion del poeta\" which is almost a compendium of his poetic thought, one reads what power the poet has after his death. Earth,says to him: Has muerto. Te disolveras en mis entranas, y flulras en el £mpetu de mis arteries, y haras mover mi corason lncansable qua regula la palpltacion del mar con el ritmo salvaje con que ayuntabas las palabras para imponer sobre los vlentos la musics de , tu esplritu. Fecundaras toda la tierra Bajaras haste las rafces de mis montanas y entraras en la composlcion del oro integrando cada una de mis vertebras, para sallr luego a la superficie de mis tendones transformado en el temblor de la hlerba sec a que ondula 40 NN, pp. 151-155. 55 Y te confundlras con mis noches, como las rocas lnvadldas por la maraa de ^ la sombre, y surglras fundldo en los metales del d£a, pregonando en la juventud del fuego la redlante lnmortalidad de la palabra slempre nueva. (DPS, p. 197) Maya repeats the Idea he has enunciated before, that Is, the generative power of the poet and of the poem. Letting Earth speak for him, It says that the poet will die and dissolve In its breast. He shall flow In the veins of the earth setting In motion Its Indefatigable heart and order­ ing the tide of the sea with the savage rhythm with which he assembled words to Impose their music on the wind. The poet will make the earth fruitful. He will descend to the roots of the mountains, be transformed Into gold, ascend to the surface of the earth and with his life-giving power transform Its face to saving grass. He will become lost in the darkness of the earth and will rise up again fused in the brightness of the day, preaching the radiant im­ mortality of the word forever new. Of all the poems that Maya has written there is one which he says Is his favorite. It is the one in which everything has not been said, the unfinished poem, the 56 song without rules, where each word serves es support for the gyrations of the liberated spirit which casts itself adventurously from one end of space to another.In the poem where everything has been said and the form is Im­ prisoned by rules there is no room for imagination and freedom of expression. That is why Maya prefers the former type. What has been discussed in the preceding pages reveals some of the ideas that Maya has about poetry itself. The following chapters will demonstrate how the poet adheres to these suggestions. ^■\"Aventura,” NN, p. 185. CHAPTER III THE UNIVERSAL QUALITY OF MAYA'S POETRY The Relevance of Universality In weighing the merits of poetry one must consider the reception it would enjoy in varying eras, in different areas and among various peoples. Does the poet treat themes that revolve around the age-old truths and problems that have beset man for centuries— life and death, love and hatred, beauty and nature? If these be the source of his poems, how does the diction, tone, and imagery he employs reinforce the subject matter of his work? Do his composi­ tions retain a unique quality that set him apart from contemporary poets? Do they possess the stamp of his en­ vironment without restricting him at the same time to the confines of hi*» country no matter how broad or narrow they may be? The purpose of the present chapter is to demonstrate the fact that from the inception of his first published 57 58 poetic work In 1924, La vide en la ■ombre, down to the publication of Navegacion nocturne in 1958, the poetry of Refeel Maya has a universal quality that is acceptable to varied times, regions and races. Some of the topics found in Maya's poetic works that have a universal appeal to all peoples and at all times are those centering on classical themes dating from ancient times: life (its meaning and duration), the struggle of man (with himself and the enveloping world), death (its inescapability), night versus day (night, the time of germination; day, the time of hope and rebirth), beauty, love and nature. In the later books of Maya, Timn de lua (1951) and Navegacion nocturaa (1958), the poet not only continues to elaborate most of these subjects but also introduces other time-honored themes— fugacity of time, memories of the past, oblivion, the shipwreck of man, his solitude and desolation, Immortality, man's search for a supreme being, hell— problems that have captured the imagination of great writers throughout the ages. In the course of Maya's poetic production, as he decreases his choice of mythological topics, he increases his interest in the life of man, the struggle that persists within man's consciousness and his ultimate end. In order to substantiate the statement that Maya's poetry possesses a universal quality, the aforementioned themes will be discussed from the viewpoint of subject- matter only, in the present chapter, insofar as the poet has developed, lessened or changed his attitude toward certain considerations. The characteristics of his par­ ticular style will be treated in a following chapter. Classical Themes and Mythological Symbols Classical themes that have withstood the test of time find a place in the depository of Maya's works, although it should be noted that they are much more prevalent in his first collection, La vide en la sombre, than in his later works. As has already been mentioned in the second chapter, Maya initiates his vocation as a poet by invoking the muse, the ancient patroness of poetry, and declares his belief in the assistance of her inspiration. There are nine more poems in this compilation that have direct bearings on mythological subjects which sig­ nifies that over a tenth of the seventy-eight poems that comprise the complete works of La vide en la sombre derive 60 their inspiration from works of antiquity. An Indian, possibly the descendant of a Chibcha chief­ tain, wandering through the crowds of Bogota, might have recalled to the poet the adventures of Odysseus. Dis­ guised by Athena as a beggar, he passed among his people unnoticed and unrecognized. In the poem, \"Desconocido,\" Maya addresses the hero: Frente de Key ofendido, ojos de dlos tacltumo, peso de heroe que ha perdldo su coturno. Aai vas, altivo y triste, llorando el fausto pasado de un imperio del que fuiste desterrado. Mas nadie sabe tu nombre y entre el vulgo indlferente pasas siempre.como un hombre i tan ausente! The poet asks the exiled hero, who laments his happy past, about his home and his faithful wife: iQue Dlos protege tus lares? $No recuerdas tu palsaje? Rafael Maya, Obra noetica (5a ed.; Bogota: Editorial ABC, 1958), p. 14. The five books of the edition used for this study will be referred to henceforth with the abbrevi ations: Vida. Coros. DPS (Desnues del sllencio), Final and Idl&’ 61 ^No tlenes, dime, una belle uujer que guerde tu lecho, con su telle de doncelle slempre eetrecho? (Vide, pp. 14-15) But the poet realises thet the hero cannot avoid the In­ exorable hand of Fete, so he urges him on, encouraging him to hope In the future: Perece, Desconocldo, que lleves, con vego esombro, todo un mundo destruldo sobre el hombro. Slgue, envuelto en tu qulmera, lejeno, trlste y err ante, que qulsas algo te espera adelante. (Vida, p. 15) Another poem Inspired by the wanderings of Odysseus Is the sonnet, \"Odlsea.\" Odysseus, condemned with the rest of the Greeks for the crime committed against Neptune, Is favored by Athena and saved by her from a precipitous death. Nevertheless, he Is left to roam over land and sea, and held prisoner on Calypso's Island where he spends his days scanning the horlson for a ship, dreaming of Penelope and Telsmachus, and longing to see the smoke curling up from his hearth, following It in his musing from a vantage point in his orchard: 62 Cruzar aaules golfos an pos da una ancantada ciudad, dormir al vlento da calidos palmares, y dasatar un d£a, sobre la mar dorada, tropal ascalonado da valas triangulares. Cantar, bajo las vines, la juventud sagrada, abrlos dal rojo mosto qua nutrio los lagares, y, la sandalia rota, dejar la nave armada por al humo lejano de los ftales hogares. Taner un huerto ameno y un caracol sonoro en cuyo fondo al aco da las aguas retoza y apacentar los ados antra colmanas da oro. En tanto que an la clara ciudad qua al sol £ulgura fuertas mancebos uncen a la trlunfal carroza los atlcos corealas que hlanden la llanura. (Vida, pp. 64 and 65) The poet addresses Aphrodite in his poem, \"Canto a la belleza,\" when he consecrates his song to her: Mi canto, diosa da los ojos bellos qua adoraron los hijos dal sonoro pialago, te consagro. Yo, como alios, te di tambien, an canastilla da oro, la ofranda juvanil da mis caballos. (Vida, p. 95) The shore, the sea and the sirens which remind one of Odysseus' story also appear in this poem: ... ni la playa ajena, ni al mar qua ofrace soladad y olvido, ni al ascollo an qua canta la sirena, romper me hiciaron la gantil cadena qua circunda tu carman floracido. (Vida, p. 95) Lika Aphrodite's myrtle, the poet wishes to grow old, entwining the fragrant wreaths of dawn at her feat: 63 Y, corno el mlrto que planto, pequeSo, junto e tu alter la mano labradors, 70 qulero envejecer, Numen risueno, renovando a tue pies, con dlarlo empeno, las £ragantes gulmaldas de la aurora. (Vida, p. 95) Wise with the wisdom of Athena whose tree Is the olive, Maya proposes to retell the tales narrated of old by Homer and Virgil: HIjo de los ilustres olivares que 8ombrean tu monte, yo, el postrero 8ere, Diosa que diga los cantares antlguos que en los golfos seculares entonaba el errante marlnero. (Vida, p. 96) He recalls the happy times when shepherds offered their first-fruits, when the woodland nymphs danced to Pan's pipes, and the merchants from afar came with gifts to Aphrodite's altar. But the centuries have passed, and incense no longer rises in her temple: Hoy, fuerte Diosa del fecundo seno, se olvldaron tus himnos perfumados, y el hondo azul de tu mirar sereno resigneda apaclentas sobre el heno que arralga entre tus marmoles volcados. tVIda, p. 96) The shepherds no longer whittle reeds to play for Aphrodite, but they chase after other beautiful women. So the poet, with his ability to recapture the past, draws near to renew her cult--the beauty and youthfulness of the 64 goddess so sdsptsble to the songs of his lyre: For eso yo me ecerco, 1lustre Dive, e renover tus ritos ancestrales. Vive por siglos tu belleza, vive tu eteme juvantud, libre y altlva, en medio de los dioses inmortales. (Vide, p. 97) An ancient chalice, perhaps discovered by a laborer tilling his fields, and now an adornment in the poet's house, recalls an old pastoral scene in the frieze deco­ rating its sides. \"A una cope antigua' 1 is written in the TfTTIgl of Dante which is not a form found frequently among Maya's poems: Cope que hoy eres de mi case adomo: sun renuevas las vlejas pastorales en el frlso que elite tu contomo. Salvada de los exodos prediales qulza te hallara labrador sencillo removiendo sus prosperos cereales. (Vida, p. 87) The design sets the poet musing about the history of this chalice. Perhaps it listened to the flute fill the meadow with its gay song, or moistened the lips of the hunter. It may have been bought when Aphrodite still reigned in Athens, or it may have accompanied the farmer's daily repast. It is very likely to have been an adjunct at the wine festivals. But by soma good fortune it was buried in a field and found recently, aa was the Venus de Milo, the \"diosa manca,\" as the poet calls her. The sight of the chalice rejuvenates the poet who is subjugated to the yoke of the chariot that encircles its sides: Cops, tu genio oculto me subjuga, y, esclavo de tu edad, a su carrosa con aureo leHo mi cervis enyuga. Un alegre vigor nutre y remoza mi juventud ante tu vista, ... (Vida, p. 89) In the last two stanzas of the poem there is a com­ mingling of the pagan with the Christian which appears from time to time in Maya's work. Maya himself says, \"Y no podfa ser de otro modo. Veinte siglos de cristianismo moldean nuestra conciencia y mas cuando se ha nacido en una ciudad catolica y recibldo desde la infancia esas ensefian- 2 zas.\" The poet says that he, a devotee of antiquity, knows how to treasure this exhumed chalice which was offered by a divine Man whose brow was crowned with the light of dawn: 2 Rafael Maya, \"Ezegesis de La vlda en la sombre.\" from AllfrlMli djl-hqafort. I <*1 ll U m i (Bogota: Editorial Santafe, 1934), p. 285. 66 Vtitago de^los tlampos mas remotos, 70 ta sabre guard ar, copa exhumeda, cono he guardado los altares rotos en donde fueras ya sacrificed® por el Hombre dlvino que trala, sobre la mansa frente coronada, toda la luz con que ae anuncla el d£a. (Vida, p. 89) The divine Man refers to Jesus Christ about whoa It Is written: \"And having taken a cup, he gave thanks and said, 'Take this and share it among you . . . '”3 And the light which encircles his brow is most appropriate for Him who said of Himself, \"1 am the light of the world. He who follows me does not walk in the darkness, but will have the light of life.”4 In the poem, \"La Muerte de Adonis,\" composed of sixty- two hendecasyllabic verses, Maya paraphrases a Greek poem about the death of Adonis.3 Three times in a heptasyliable verse the sad news re-echoes, \"Ha muerto el bello Adonis.\" 3St. Luke, XXII, 17. 4St. John, VIII, 12. ' ’ Maya seems to draw inspiration from Idyll XXX, \"The death of Adonis,\" of Theocritus. In the translation by C. S. Calverley, the remorse of the boar is stressed; Maya dwells on the mortal wound of Adonis and the Inconsolable grief of Cythera. C. S. Calverley (translator), Theocritus (3rd ed.; London: George Bell and Sons, 1892), pp. 169-171. 67 The blood-red anemone springe from the earth dampened by hie blood: ... De eu muelo bianco fluye un cardeno arroyo que humedece la tierra maternal . •. corre la eangre del herido muelo, empaga el vientre enjuto y colorea de purpura caliente los costados. (Vida, p. 74) Aphrodite cries disconsolately as she kisses the young man: ... Y Clprls llora desolada y besa el labio mustlo del mancebo. (Vida, p. 74) And she begs him: besame con el beso de tus labios tlblos aun, no sigas tras la hue11a del Rey medroso, de Akeron nocturno. Trenza a mi cuello tus floridos brasos, alza el pecho febril, besame, Adonis. (Vida, p. 75) But when she realizes that her supplications are to no avail, she calls out to Persephone, the Queen o£ the Dead, with whom she has shared Adonis, to receive him into her kingdom: i Persefona inhumana! reclbe al caro esposo que desclende hacia tu reino. Acogelo pladosa. (Vida, p. 75) Aphrodite has never relished the idea o£ Adonis' hunting in the wild forest, £or he was too immature to wield the 68 bow Against beasts, such as boars: jCuan imprudente fue! Mo manelaba el arco, puss bus brasos careclan de la fuersa adquirida en el estadlo, y era debil y £ino como un junco. Y as£ se fue a la salva, una mailana, a perseguir las bestias camiceras. (Vida, p. 75) With Aphrodite the Eros mourn, \"Ha muerto el bello Adonis.\" In order to manifest their wrath, they destroy the instru­ ments responsible for bringing him to his death: ... Y uno pisotea las fleehas, otro el arco, y ese rompe el carcaj emplumado. (Vida, p. 75) After unsuccessful attempts to rouse Adonis, the Eros tell Aphrodite to hush, for her entreaties will be of no avail before Persephone who turns a deaf ear to terrestrial sorrows: ICalls, por fin, oh dulce Citerea! Persefona no entrega al que en sus brazos cayo. La madre subterranea esqulva su duro o£do ante el dolor terreno. (Vida, p. 76) Since there is no hope, they bid her to cast aside her nuptial crown and call Hymen to extinguish the light of her bright torch: Arroja presto la nupcial corona y has que Hlmeneo, el de florldos ramos, 69 en el unbral de le mortuorle eat ancle la luz extlnga de su clara an tore ha. (Vide, p. 76) Although the complete text of \"La muerte de Adonis\" is not Included here, from the verses that have been In­ corporated, one can see how aptly Maya has employed the hendecasyliable line with free verse to portray the feeling of activity in the forest and the flowing of Adonis' blood. In thirteen verses he uses enjambment to effect this sensa­ tion of motion. Diana, the Roman Artemis, who is known as the Hunt­ ress, the goddess of the Moon, and the pure Malden-Goddess, is the inspiration for the sonnet, \"Diana Victrix.\" In the first quatrain where the poet refers to the unsurpassable beauty of Diana, he also implies her swift-footed prowess as a huntress when he mentions her \"ligera sandal la.” The sun, which lends its light to the moon, gilds the temples of the Moon goddess and bums in her eyes in the second quatrain. Diana's title of huntress is again alluded to in the first tercet. And when the poet speaks of her \"barren womb\" in the last tercet he is thinking of Diana as the Maiden Goddess: 70 N1 las altas doncellas qua Sandro, con ligera sandalla y aureos valos, pinto bajo al ramaje danso da floras, gosan tu pura prlmsvera nl dlsfrutan al clelo da tu natal palsaja. El sol dora tus slanas como un oro salvaje, axda an tus ojos toda la lus da la pradera, y hay un parfuma exotico qua nos racuarda un viaja lejano, si dasatas la fuarta cabellera. Eras alta y flexible. Con al arco podrfas cruzar la salva al trota largo da tus labrales. En tu seno divides las noches y los d£as como la tlerra. Y nunca da tu vlentre Infacundo daras, ni aun a la sombra da tus arboles fielea, nuava came da angustla y da dolor al mundo. (Vida, p. 100) The subject shifts from specific mythological charac­ ters to scenes reminiscent of them in the poem, \"Jardln antlguo.\" One imagines a vista that might have been woven in tapestries or painted around amphorae. In the light of an autumnal moon the ancient garden lies with its marble gnawed by time, the graceful flow of its fountains stilled, white statues hidden in recessed corners, the pavement obliterated by invading ivy, and the holy sarcophagus of Silence guarded by erect old cypresses. The poet, gazing on this melancholic spectacle, recapitulates his ideas when he states: Quiero abrir la petrea carcel de tus fuentes agotadas — fuentes nacidas al pie de las colinas lejanas— 71 y perderme en el arboreo laberlnto de tus send as ante el crepuaculo tlblo que anublan las hojas secas. Qulero llorar^a la sombra de tus estatuas vencldas, dlgnas del clasico olvldo bajo una selva de enclnas, y descifrar el mis ter lo del ave antlgua que vela inmovll sobre el acanto de tus columns de pledra. (Vida, p. 77) This scene of death, taking on an aura of mystery under the charm of the moon, represents the inevitable passing of the transitory which Maya captures in this poem of eighteen hexadecasyliable couplets. Another scene, not of slow death but of peaceful living, is that which Maya represents in the sonnet, \"Pastoral,\" invoking those pacific countrysides that Virgil frequently portrayed in verse. The time is late afternoon when the sky lights up with the brilliance of the setting sun. Blue smoke rises slowly over the village, and an emptied cart, returned from the labors in the fields, rests beneath the pensive laurel. The ruddy tint of the sky changes to violet, and the song of the flute can be heard in the distance. A star appears in the serene blue sky as the fleecy clouds make the afternoon resemble a sheep- fold where the sun's rays feed golden hay to the flock: La tarda an lumbres da arrebol sa lnmola y daja an la collna un fugitivo temblor, como al carmfn da un Prlmltlvo qua la faz da la Vlrgen arrebola. El humo azul dal cab anal tranola sobra al valla falls de esmalte vivo, y debajo da un sauce pensatlvo esta volcada la carrata sola. Huye al ultimo lampo de violate por el cenlt. Dasda el lejano rlsco llora una flauta su anodon secret a. La e8tralla naca an al asul sereno, y ya toda la tarda as un aprlsco donde floraea la humlldad dal hano. (Vida, p. 45) One cannot help but think that Maya had In mind poets such as Theocritus, Virgil and Horace when he wrote the poem consisting of twenty-three triplets, \"A los poetas primitives.\" The authors of The Winged Horse tell us that Hesiod wrote poetry suited to a quiet, friendly life and that he \"made a kind of encyclopedia of the gods, their ancestry, birth, adventures, and habits. . . .\"** In de­ scribing Horace, who wrote of the joys of the simple life, Auslander and Hill say that he \"sat among his grapes and books, dreamed under dark trees beside singing water, and ^Joseph Auslander and Frank Ernest Hill, The Wiraad Horse (The Story of the Poets and Their Poetry) (New York: Doubleday, Doran and Company, Inc., 1940), p. 32. 73 celebrated the riches of the spirit at peace with the world.Horace frequently longed for the simple joys of the countryside In the midst of the bustle of Rome. It reminds one of Maya's love for the quiet life when Horace In the second Epode, \"In Praise of Country Life,\" exclaims: What joy, beneath some holm-oak old and grey Or on thick turf, one's limbs to lay; While streams past toppling banks roll down their flood, And the birds croon In every wood, And fountains murmur with their gushing streams Sounds that shall sooth to sleep and dreams. They also point out that Virgil first wrote about the earth and the farmers and the simple things of life in his o Eclogues which resembled the pastorals of Theocritus. In his Georgies. besides exalting the labor in the fields, he speaks of \"the intoxication of April and the brother­ hood of plant, animals and men.\"1® In Virgil's first pastoral \"Tityrus and Mellboeus\" one detects the same ^Auslander and Hill, p. 60. ®John Marshall et al. (translated by Various Hands), The Complete Works of Horace (London: J. M. Dent and Sons, Ltd., 1931), pp. 113-114. o Auslander and Hill, p. 67. 10Ibid.. p. 69. \\ 74 nostalgia for tha familiar fields and homeland that Maya expresses in his poem, \"A los poetas prlmltlvos.\" The pastoral begins: Beneath the shade which beechen boughs diffuse, You, Tityrus, entertain your sylvan muse. Round the wide world In banishment we roam, Forced from our pleasing fields and native home; While, stretched at east, you sing your happy loves, And Amaryllis fills the shirty groves.11 The peaceful mood that permeated the verses of these ancient poets pervades the first stanzas of Maya's poem in which a subtle fragrance fills the air, and the earth shares its divine murmur with the poets who greet the evening star from the sides of the road: Vivistels bajo el cielo da la infancla y fue vuestra vision, en la distanda, un cielo que era un poco de fragancia. Os dlo la tlerr» su rumor divino y en las tardes, a or 11 las del camino, saludasteis al astro vespertlno. (Vida, p. 100) Although the simple beauty would bring the poets to their knees \"en medio de esa pastoral sencilla,\" they would also leave the peacefulness of life to sing of amorous \"Pastoral I--Tityrus and Mellboeus,\" John Dryden (translator), The Works of Virgil (London: Oxford Univer slty Press, 1961), p. 3. 75 caprice* and the life of the immortal gods: Ya, dejando la pas da los plantlos, 1lorabais amorosos desvarlos en la agreate ribera de los r£os, o bien, bajo los fertiles psrrales, cantabais con las arpas ancestrales la vida de los dioses inmortales. (Vida, p. 101) Maya acknowledges the tremendous inspiration with which these ancient poets were endowed when he writes in another triplet: Y en el alba del cielo adolescente bajo la inspiracion, calladamente, como un halo de oro a vuestra frente. (Vida, p. 101) Not only were the poets gifted with inspiration but also were successful in its use, and so ... los ninos, en festivo coro, os ofreclan el laurel sonoro entre el rumor de las cigarras de oro. (Vida, p. 101) Maya recalls in the next triplet the love that some of these poets had for the labor in the fields when the grains were heavy with seeds: For vosotros fue dulce la faena rural y al punto, de simientes llena, sobre los surcos se doblo la avena. (Vida, p. 101) Four stanzas ratall the story o£ Homer’s hero, Odys­ seus, when his raft is torn apart by the storm sent by Poseidon, and fate carries him to the land of the Phaea- cians, where he sleeps covered by a heap of dry leaves until awakened by the maidens of the princess of the 12 country. A vosotros, en golfos seculares, llegaban melancollcos cantares que atra£an las velas triangulares; pero lumbres amigas en el cielo mostraron siempre a vuestro raudo anhelo la curve playa del nativo suelo. Y al dejar, coronado de gaviotas, hendldo el mastil y las jarclas rotas, el barco que sureera agues remotes, os recibieron, bajo verdes ramas, las doncellas, flexibles como llamas, danzando entre la flor de las retamas. (Vida, p. 102) Maya mentions again the poets' predilection for rural thsskes, mingled with the conversation they enjoy with the gods: Y labrastels la tierra primitive ceSlda en vuestros cantos de una viva guirnalda, como una anfora votive. 12 Edith Hasdlton, Mythology (New York: Mentor Books, 1957), p. 209. 77 Y entre el sesgo dorado de las hocas escucho vuestro ofdo las valoces palabras dal mensaje da los dlosas. (Vida, pp. 102 and 103) In tha final stanza Maya compares tha slmpla and vast vision of tha aarly poets with space in which tha sea is inlayed with tha irldascant light of its chaste pearl: Y fue vuastra vision sancllla y vasta como al aspacio an donda al mar angasta la luz mudabla da su parla casta. (Vida. p. 103) This poem, a summation of tha spirit and themes of the aarly Greek and Roman poets, is tha last of tha nine in La vida an la eombra that Illustrate Maya's choice of mythological inspiration. In a variety of forms— couplets, tr i p le ts , T1HHI TV\"! q u atrain s, sonnets and combinations 13 of hepta-, hendecasyliable and Alexandrine verses — the poet has conveyed many moods— awe, pleasure, sorrow, nos­ talgia, joy and admiration. These poems have been a re­ capitulation of mythological themes in Maya's first book of poetry. In his later works the poet tends to use these themes in a metaphorical rather than a narrative sense. 13 In Spanish verse an Alexandrine line is one of four­ teen syllables with a caesura between the hemistichs. Maya always places the caesura after the seventh syllable em­ ploying hiatus and dlaersls wherever necessary. 78 Corot del mediod£a, published In 1928, differs sub­ stantially from Maya's first anthology, La vlda en la t sombra. The first considerable difference is the decreased nupober of poems (there are nineteen in Coros t seventy-eight in Vida). Furthermore, the poet breaks with classical forms employing free verse and mixed meters in many of the poems. Maya*8 treatment of human problems— man's struggle in life, his attraction to high ideals, and his ultimate end, death— give to Coros del mediodfa a cohesiveness which is not so apparent in his earlier work. In order not to im­ pinge on an aspect of his universality which will be dis­ cussed later--Maya's concern with the age-old concerns of man— they will be set aside temporarily, in order to remark here on those classical symbols which Maya utilizes to fortify the Impact of his message. The first poem of Coros del mediodfa. \"Interior, refers to an interior light which is \"traditionally . . . I4Coros del mediodfa from Rafael Maya, Obra poet lea (5a ed.; Bogota: Editorial ABC, 1958), pp. 117-118. 79 equated with the spirit.By means of the symbol of light, Maya introduces his readers into the milieu of Coros dfiLatglsdift- -the conscience of man and his constant war­ fare with spiritual enemies inside his personality. Outside, the afternoon diffuses its ancient splendor, burning in the fire of a red and violent spring: La tarde dlfund£a su resplandor antiguo sobre el mundo. Era la luz venlda de los campos remotos, ardidos en el fuego de una roja y violenta prlmavera. (Coros. p. 117) Speaking in the first person, the poet says that as they were conversing an internal brightness illumined her countenance like the genial atmosphere of amber that sur­ rounds the sweet images on illustrious walls: Conversabamos. Una dlafanidad interna lluminaba tu fas, como esa tibia atmosfera de ambar que rodea a las dulces imagenes de los muros 1lustres. (Coros. p. 117) The afternoon becomes even brighter as it lights up ^Juan Eduardo Cirlot, A Dictionary of Symbols (London: Routledge and Kagan Paul, 1962), p. 179. 80 gloriously like a t ample that has bean invaded by dishev­ eled barbarians with burning torches: La tarde se encendfa glorlosamente como un templo donde hub las en penetrado, con teas encendIdas, los birbaros grenudos, ensmlgos del oro de los techos y de las colgaduras cuyos pllegues de purpura revlsten el resplandor llturgico del cedro. (Coros. p. 117) Suddenly the light goes out. The hills in the dis­ tance darken, changing expressions, like a face struck by human tragedy. The world is extinguished. Pero de pronto fuese apagando la luz. ^En la dlstancla se opacaron las rustless colinas, canbiando de expresion como los rostros por donde pass la tragedla humane. El mundo se extingu£a. (Coros, p. 118) While the light from without is being snuffed out, the lamps within are slowly lit, and she, whose face was illu­ mined by an Internal brightness as they spoke, withdraws beyond the mist of the pallid gold shed by the evening lamps. Mas entonces, en tu alcoba profunda, poblada por los dlafanos espejos que multipllcan tu ademan a modo de una ague movll, se encendleron, lent as, las lamparas de plata. 81 D«Jut« la vantana y yo te vl aleJarte, delgmda, blanca, rftmlca, con tua aereos dados sujetando la rubla cabellara, a traves da la bruma da oro palldo qua vert£a la noche da tus lsmparas. (Coros, p. 118) Ona cannot overlook tha luminosity that Maya craatas in this poem. If it is not tha exterior brilliance of an afternoon sun, it is the radiance diffused by tha lamps within* A lamp, as well as light, is a \"symbol . . . of tha spirit,”^ and Maya employs this traditional sign in tha introduction of Coros dal madiodfa to indicate tha direction the poems of this collection will take toward problems of tha spirit. In tha poem \"Invitacion a nevegar\"17 man's existence is equated with tha sea. Tha great epics contain many epi- 4 sodas that involve tha sea which has traditionally bean considered \"not only as tha source of life but also as its In tha first stanza tha poet wonders: l6Cirlot, p. 168. *7Coros dal madiodfa. pp. 138-141. *®Cirlot, p. 268. 82 Cuando, cuando llegara al d£a en qua me dlea: ea nacaaarlo navagar. Allsta,una nava qua tanga un timon y un palo para colgar la vala nomade qua ha da pardaraa an al mar ancho. (Coros, p. 138) Tha poet asks whan ha will be told to ready a ship to sail tha vast sea* He comas from a race which bora tha sign of mariners upon its brow. One ancestor was so brave that ha compares him to Ulysses: Mi rasa llevaba en la frente al Imgeratlvo mandato. Despues lo grabo an su escudo un poeta qua fue corsario, y puso un angel con un remo y una torre qua eleva un faro. La^tlbia noche da mi lnfancia oyo una historla da naufraglos an qua ml abuelo, qua ten£a un corason da Ulises barbaro, murio da vlajo an una isla comiando datiles dorados. (Coros. p. 139) But the only sea that he is to sail is that measured with tha beat of classic versa, for ha lives far from tha sea, in a city of granite and marble surrounded by tall, mute hills: Vino despues al mar medldo con al compas dal verso clasico. 83 Pero yo tmci en una urbe hecha da granlto y de maxmol, con aacudoa de pledra toeca que unen la clave de los arcos, y liana de polvo y de hues os como un antlguo catefalco. Lejos del mar! Altas colines estrechan, nudes, el eublto. (Coros. p. 140) The sea represents freedom for the poet because he says that he will depart for the numerous roads opened up to him In space, and he will leave behind earth with Its bitterness and sorrows: Yo partire ... y ya solo tendre delante los mil camlnos del espaclo. Y he de grltar: Adios joh tlerra! amasada con polvo y llanto bajo la furla de tus clelos, y crusade por r£os amargos que te clSen a la clntura el vlejo sayal de los campos. (Coros. pp. 140-141) Nothing will detain him. A strange wind whistles. The mist clears. He bids us to lift the gallant mast for the nomadic sail which will be lost In the vast sea. Ah! mas nada sera bastante a detenerme. Un vlento ext ratio sllba. La bnsna se despeja. 84 Clavamos el mastil gtllacdo para colgar la vala nomade qua ha da pardaraa an al mar ancho. (Coro*, p. 141) \"Invitacl6n a navagar” is a call for man to embark on hla journey through tha aaa of Ufa, unencumbered by ter­ ras trial cares. For Maya, It Is tha vocation of a poet which attracts him: Corte la caiia qua se else an la ribera da los lagos, para cantar panes antlguas o venlderos desengaSos, y, sobra al cielo o al inflemo, cada verso quedo temblando como con al peso da un eve suala dob1area un junco largo. (Coros. p. 141) In this stanza the poet declares that ha whittled a flute to sing of old sorrows and of future deceits. Man, like tha poet, must make tha choice of tha route he will follow over tha paths of tha sea. Man faces many hardships as he sails over tha sea of life and tha struggle ha encounters whan ha loses tha wings 10 of equilibrium is suggested in tha poem, \"Las alas.\" Tha poem which begins l9Coros dal madiodfa, pp. 151-155 85 Yo tanfa do* *1**, •1 *1* azul, *1 al* roja (Coro*. p. 151) remind* one of the Greek deities depicted with wings that portrayed love or victory. In Maya'* concept they symbo­ lize victory and ascent. These two wings— the one blue and the other red**-are the forces that balance man. The former Is protective, like the wing of a warrior angel who \"deflende a los ninos / y vela el stxeSo de las vfrgenes.\" It Is also like \"el pabellon de flores / que protege los ldlllos campes- tres.\" The blue wing Is also compared to a multi-colored tent in a festival and to the shadow of the church bell- tower. The red wing, on the other hand, signifies ascent. This wing was on his shoulder to furrow the paths of the sky, to fly above the sea and earth, to discover celestial shores, where beacons are lit to guide ships and shepherds through the roads of the earth, and to follow the river of light that springs from the rosy meadows of Paradise where unclad virgins pick dew In their hands: El ala roja era [en] ml hooabro para surcar las rutas aereas. Para el vuelo soberblo sobre el mar y la tlerra. 86 Part descubrir 1m costM ealutta, donde se anclendan los faros qua orisntan a 1m naves y a los eonductorM da rebaftos por los camlnos da la tiarra. Para sagulr al cauca da la lus qua nace en 1m rosadM praderM dal Para£so donda 1m v£rgenes daanudM recogan al roc£o an sus rnsnos. (Coros, p. 154) Tha poet In tha 1m t nineteen verses laments for man the loss of these two wings, a loss which makes him totter as a laborer returned from the grape harvest. He cries In vain for the wings that he does not find. Alone, wandering and distracted, each step (without his wings) brings him closer to the great nocturnal chaos: Hoy, cuando de ml vlda penden los aSos muertos, como 1m floras sec as de 1 m ven tanas abler t M para los festlvalM mundamos, camino por la tlerra tambaleandome a modo dal labrador que vuelve de la vendimla, porque he perdldo mis dos alM. Vanamente, en la noche clega, por 1m cludades qua festajan con ramllletes de faro1m su trlunfo da lujurla y de sangra, clamo por mis dos alM. No 1m encuentro y solo, arranta y abstra£do, voy como fundlendome, p m o a p m o , an al gran caoa noctumo. (Coros, p. 155) 87 Maintaining tht 14m of wings and tha aacant of nan in his attaapta to soar Into tha hlghast reaches of spaca, Maya utlllsaa tha development of alrplanas in tha twantiath century, conbining an aneiant idaa with a nodarn invention, to coonunicata this notion. In \"Capitan da valnta aSos\"20 tha poat asks tha young pilot to carry him in his light plana. Lika birds who (by naans of wings) risa Into tha sky, tha pilot will fly with his body alongatad by tha impetus of tha sudden start and with a last raflection of terrestrial verdure in his ayes, contracted by tha fury of tha wind which seises hln in its whirlwind as it seises tha gods: Cono sa ranontan los pajaros con al solo equips ja de sus plumas, y llevando una hoja con la ultima rana an qua sa posaron, as£ vas a las rutas aareas con tu cuerpo alargado an al fmpetu dal arranque, y un ultimo rafla jo dal vardor terrastra m tus ojos astrangulados ya por la furia dal vlanto qua ta arrebata an su torbellino cono a los diosas. (Coros. p. 182) They will fly through tha norning like tha first voice of nan. Tha poet's heart, a prisoner of earth like tha 20Coros dal nediodia. pp. 180-184 88 roots of a tree, will beat above hie life like the pilot's propeller. They will fly through the morning purified In the light which renews the conscience of "
