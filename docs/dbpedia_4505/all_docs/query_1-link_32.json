Prior to the Leagues Cup, we hit a phase of injuries, where we lost our style of play and Leagues Cup has helped us recover it and helped us get our players back into game rhythm. Our play style has evolved positively throughout the tournament. We are very happy to get to the Round of 16 after three different games against three different teams.â\n\nOn Euguene Ansahâ¦Â\n\nâ(Eugene) Ansah is a player that changes the game. He has energy, throughout his career he has always scored goals. He scored because he is positioned well, all throughout the danger zone. Ansah is a player that is calm on the ball. I am very happy with how well he has fit into FC Dallas.â\n\nForward Eugene Ansah\n\nOn scoring the match winning goalâ¦\n\nâIt felt amazing to score the goal tonight. When Iâm on the bench I look forward to scoring and making an impact when I come in because when youâre sitting there as a player you want to prove yourself. Tonight I wanted to come into the game to push the team and help contribute. Iâm very happy that I was able to come into the game and score to help us win and Iâm looking forward to the next match.â\n\nOn mentally preparing to come in as a substituteâ¦\n\nâWhen I am sitting on the bench I am always focused on the game. Coming from the bench I already knew what I needed to do when coming into the game. It makes me feel really good that I am able to contribute to the team. It is important to always keep pushing and stay motivated as we have to fight until the end.âÂ\n\nForward JesÃºs Ferreira\n\nOn the teamâs performanceâ¦\n\nâI think we started off the game with the right intensity and the right mindset. We knew it was going to be hot, we knew it was going to be a long game. I think overall the team handled business and we kept pushing until we could score the second goal and finish out the game.â\n\nOn teammate Eugene Ansahâs play latelyâ¦\n\nâHeâs a guy that works hard. Heâs a guy in training thatâs always asking and demanding from players. Heâs always willing to adapt and to listen to guys that have already played in this role and this system. Weâre glad with his performance and weâre glad that heâs able to come in and score goals and make a difference. Weâre happy to have him here.â\n\nALAN VELASCOÂ\n\nAbout the matchâ¦\n\nâThis was a difficult game with it being very hot. I am glad we were able to pull this off and we are now rewarded with advancing to the Round of 16.â\n\nOn the penaltyâ¦Â\n\nThe penalty taker is Jesus Ferreira, he was going to take the penalty kick but I spoke to him and he humbly allowed me to take the penalty shot. I was going through a tough time after losing a loved one. Jader came up to the ball but I told him that I was going to take the penalty kick. Thankfully I was able to score and it helped us get the win.Â\n\nOn the Round of 16 matchupâ¦Â\n\nâAt the beginning of the tournament, I was not expecting us to take on Inter Miami CF. We are going to welcome Lionel Messi and Inter Miami CF until the game starts. It will be a dream to play against Messi.âÂ\n\nMAZATLÃN POSTGAME QUOTESÂ\n\nHead Coach Rescalvo Ismael\n\nOn tonight's gameâ¦Â\n\nâIt feels a bit bitter to lose a game we could have won. FC Dallas scored its opportunities and we did not. We did not have the ball tonight. We lost the ball too quick. We cannot attack if we do not have the ball which we did not have throughout the first half.â"
