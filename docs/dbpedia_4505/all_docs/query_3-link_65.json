        "text": "The Clinical Research Unit (CRU) facilitates the clinical research of TTUHSC investigators on the Amarillo campus by providing numerous services such as design support, IRB assistance, committee assistance, biostatistics, skilled nursing assistance, clinical space/exam rooms, and guidance with grant and publication submissions.\n\nThe CRU strives to help investigators as much as possible, to increase the likelihood that projects will be quickly approved by the IRB and that studies will be publishable in peer-reviewed journals. Faculty members interested in increasing their overall publications and becoming more competitive during reviews for tenure or promotion are highly encouraged to take advantage of the CRU. The CRU also provides assistance to students and residents interested in research.\n\nResearch Highlights:\n\nInfantRisk Center:\n\nThe InfantRisk Center is currently recruiting for several research projects! For more information on the studies below, go to https://www.infantrisk.com/\n\n1. Milk repository study: investigates the transfer of selected drugs from mothers into their mother's milk. Some of the drugs being reviewed are: Atomoxetine (Strattera), Brexpiprazole (Rexulti), Brivaracetam (Briviact), Buspirone (Buspar), Carprazine (Vraylar), Domperidone (Motilium) 120+ mg/day, Guanfacine (Intuniv), Ketamine, Lacosamide (Vimpat), Lisinopril, Lurasidone (Latuda), Promethazine (Phenergan)\n\n2. Changes in breastmilk color survey: The InfantRisk Center is #researching #breastmilk color changes: what do you think causes it? Did it affect #breastfeeding? Pay it forward to future moms and their clinicians through this survey.\n\nMaternal and Child Health Research Lab:\n\nThe Maternal and Child Health Research Lab is currently recruiting participants in Amarillo for the Maternal Well-Being Study. The goal of this study is to explore the ways that mothers' access to proper nutrition and social support can be enhanced using advances in health technology and healthcare delivery. To be eligible, participants must be able to speak English or Spanish, are between 28-36 weeks pregnancy, 18 years or older, and screen positively for food insecurity or qualify for Medicaid, WIC, SNAP, or TANF.\n\nPlease see the links below for more information:\n\nMaternal and Child Health Research Lab\n\nCheck if you're eligible here\n\nDr. Skye McLaurin-Jiang, MD, Assistant Professor, Department of Pediatrics, and Dr. Christine Garner, PhD, RD, CLC, Assistant VP of Research, Amarillo and Assistant Professor in the Department of Pediatrics and InfantRisk Center, have initiated the Maternal Well-Being Project, which is generously sponsored by The Don and Sybil Harrington Foundation, Amarillo Area Foundation, United Way, Laura W.

Vasylyeva, MD, Ph.D., received a prestigious PCORI grant. Working with colleague Dr. Alisa Khan, MD, MPH from Boston Children's Hospital, Harvard Medical School, Dr. Tetyana Vasylyeva has received a subcontract from the Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Institute for $438,756. The project entitled “Comparing Three Approaches to Communication with Hospitalized Children and Families with Limited English Proficiency” will be implemented in Amarillo, Texas. The goal of the project is to compare different translation approaches with families of patients in clinical care at the hospitals in West Texas to see how these approaches reduce the likelihood of adverse events in this vulnerable patient population.\n\nDr. Olu Adesanya, MD, Associate Professor of Pediatrics, received $15,000 from the Office of Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion as well as another $10,000 for the Health Disparities Research Program to initiate her projects entitled \"Pediatric residency curriculum training for screening and addressing Social Determinants of Health (SDOH) for our pediatric population to improve health equity outcomes\" and \"Addressing Social Determinants of Health (SDOH) in the Pediatric outpatient setting at Texas Tech in Amarillo, Texas.\" These projects will help to understand how to break down barriers to healthcare access for West Texas pediatric patients and train our next generation of residents in this area to meet the needs of vulnerable patients."
