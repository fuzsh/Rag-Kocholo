One of those, \"Saved by a Poem\" he directed in Teatro del Pueblo's 2006 Political Theatre Festival. According to Teatro Del Pueblo, it is that very play, which also goes by the name \"Fecha Feliz\" (\"Happy Date\") which earned Amarilla his Nobel nomination.\n\nBased on a true story, \"Saved by a Poem\" takes place in the countryside of Paraguay in 1975, when General Alfredo Stroessner was in power. In the play, the mother tries to save the life of her only son from dictator Stroessner through a poem.\n\nThe list of nominees for a Nobel prize are normally not revealed until fifty years after the award is given, but news of Amarilla's nomination was leaked to the press. The winner of the Nobel Prize for Literature will be announced in October. If Amarilla were to win, he would be its youngest recipient.\n\nTeatro del Pueblo is currently in the second week of its ninth annual Political Theatre Festival, continuing through March 13, 2010.\n\nLinks to Related Topics (Tags):\n\nHeadlines: March, 2004; Peace Corps Paraguay; Directory of Paraguay RPCVs; Messages and Announcements for Paraguay RPCVs; Writing - Paraguay; Minnesota\n\nWhen this story was posted in March 2010, this was on the front page of PCOL:\n\nPeace Corps Online The Independent News Forum serving Returned Peace Corps Volunteers\n\nFeb 10, 2010: Senator Dodd to Retire\n\nDodd retires from Senate 6 Jan\n\nCameron Hume named US Ambassador to Pakistan 8 Feb\n\nFlorida RPCVs sponsor Everglades Experience 6 Feb\n\nJeff Hall brings aid to Sierra Leone 1 Feb\n\nPeace Corps to reach 11,000 PCVs in 2016 1 Feb\n\nHugh Pickens writes: Standing Bear Looks to the Future 27 Jan\n\nAnn Varghese survives 55 hours in Haiti rubble 26 Jan\n\nJohn Guy LaPlante at 80 was oldest PCV 17 Jan\n\nSteve Radelet to advise Hilary Clinton on Development 15 Jan\n\nObituary for Co-Author of Â‘The Ugly American' 14 Jan\n\nPeace Corps Establishes Program in Indonesia 11 Dec\n\nWhat Happened to Obama's Promise? 3 Dec\n\nGeorge Packer writes: Obama's Troubles 24 Nov\n\nPC Mourns Loss of Morocco PCV So-Youn Kim 17 Nov\n\nPeace Corps volunteers return to Madagascar 16 Nov\n\nPC to grow by several thousand over next 2 years 15 Nov\n\nFormer Hostage John Limbert named to Iran Bureau 11 Nov\n\nCarrie Hessler Radelet named PC Deputy Director 9 Nov\n\nGaramendi Sworn into Congress 9 Nov\n\nJesse Lonergan writes graphic novel \"Joe and Azat\" 4 Nov\n\nDavid Macaray writes: Hearts and Minds in Afghanistan 29 Oct\n\nDustin Hogenson writes: Sauna in Kazakstan 26 Oct\n\nMemo to Incoming Director Williams\n\nPCOL has asked five prominent RPCVs and Staff to write a memo on the most important issues facing the Peace Corps today.
