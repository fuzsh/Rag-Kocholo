        "text": "Austin FC begins its journey in the inaugural Leagues Cup this Friday night, when the Verde & Black will host Liga MX opponents MazatlÃ¡n FC in the South 1 Group Stage opener. The match is scheduled for a 7:30 p.m. CT kickoff at Q2 Stadium.\n\nLooking to learn more about Leagues Cup? Click here for everything you need to know about the brand-new tournament and Austin FCâs participation in it.\n\nTune-In\n\nFans can watch the match for free in English or Spanish in over 100 countries on MLS Season Pass on Apple TV.\n\nStream: Click here to watch the match, or access it through any device compatible with the Apple TV app. An MLS Season Pass subscription is required in order to watch.\n\nRadio: The match will be broadcast live locally in English on iHeart Radioâs Alt 97.5, and in Spanish on Univisionâs TUDN Radio Austin (104.3-HD2, KLQB-FM).\n\nAustin FC Outlook\n\nAustin enters the Leagues Cup in its best stretch of league form this season. The Verde & Black are 4-1-1 in their last six MLS matches, scoring 13 goals in those matches and moving from 12th to 5th in the Western Conference standings.\n\nThat run also includes three straight home wins at Q2 Stadium, which bodes well for Head Coach Josh Wolffâs side as they host both of their Leagues Cup group stage opponents and look to carry momentum into the tournament. Ethan Finlay and Gyasi Zardes have both scored in each of those three home wins: a pair of 3-0 victories over in-state rivals Dallas and Houston in June, and a 2-1 triumph over Sporting KC last Saturday.\n\nIn order to advance to the Leagues Cup knockout rounds, Austin FC needs to finish in either first or second in its three-team group with MazatlÃ¡n and JuÃ¡rez. A victory in Fridayâs match would ensure that no matter what happens in next Tuesdayâs game between the two Liga MX teams, the Verde & Black would need only a draw to advance when they play JuÃ¡rez on July 29.\n\nATXFCâs sights will be firmly set on winning the group though, which would ensure hosting rights in the Round of 32, Round of 16, and Quarterfinal for Austin.\n\nMazatlÃ¡n FC Outlook\n\nLike Austin, MazatlÃ¡n was founded recently, playing their first match in 2020. They currently sit 15th in the Liga MX standings, with two draws and one loss from their opening three matches of the new season in Mexico.\n\nMazatlÃ¡n is coached by Spaniard Ismael Rescalvo, who previously had stints at multiple clubs across South America. MLS fans might recognize MazatlÃ¡n striker Luis Amarilla as a familiar face, who scored 15 goals in 60 appearances for Minnesota United FC before making the move to Mexico.\n\nCenter back NÃ©stor Vidrio captains the team, and has over 400 professional appearances to his name in a career spanning back to 2007. Vidrio won an Olympic Gold Medal with Mexico in 2012. MazatlÃ¡nâs only goal thus far this season was scored by Venezuelan international Eduard Bello in a 1-1 home draw against Pachuca.\n\nPossible MazatlÃ¡n Lineup"
