        "text": "Short-horned grasshoppers are important constituents of grassland ecosystems, with some species causing substantial damage to rangeland. A statewide, comprehensive inventory between 1959 and 1961 listed 117 species from Oklahoma with 2,101 county records documented. From June 2019 through October 2020, short-horned grasshoppers were surveyed in all 77 Oklahoma counties. The surveys, combined with a thorough examination of museum specimens, resulted in five new state records and 734 new county records. Our results increased the number of known records by 35%, bringing the total number of county records for Acrididae and Romaleidae in Oklahoma to 2,835. The five new state records were Trachyrhachys aspera (Scudder), Trimerotropis melanoptera McNeill, Metaleptea brevicornis (L.), Melanoplus macclungi Rehn, and Phrynotettix tshivavensis (Haldeman). County records for the subfamilies Leptysminae and Cyrtacanthacridinae had the greatest relative increase (70 and 55%, respectively), while Romaleinae and Melanoplinae had the least (26 and 25%, respectively). The data update current ranges of economically important species as well as species of potential conservation concern.\n\nMantids (Insecta, Mantodea) are a monophyletic group of insects in the Dictyoptera clade. The group has not been well studied for Mexico, and its diversity and biogeographical patterns are not well documented. In this work, specimens were collected in the field, mounted, and identified using morphological and molecular characteristics. A taxonomic list, photographs, and an identification key are provided for families, genera, and species of mantids of Morelos. This work provides new empirical evidence of geographical distribution of mantids in Central Mexico.\n\nUntil recently, the State of Puebla, Mexico had no official reported chronic cases of Trypanosoma cruzi Chagas. The State has conditions of social and ecological marginalization for transmission of infectious agents to be effective. Entomological indices and triatomines at the municipality of Xayacatlán de Bravo, Puebla were analyzed, as well as the DTU of circulating T. cruzi. In total, 117 triatomines were collected. The isolated strains of T. cruzi were molecularly characterized using the 24Sa rRNA and miniexon markers. Results indicated Meccus pallidipennis Stål and Triatoma bassolsae are at the municipality of Xayacatlán de Bravo. We found natural infection rate of 33.3%, and the circulating DTU was TcI. Data indicated the need to study biological and bionomic aspects associated with triatomines that are adapting to human dwelling.\n\nAedes albopictus (Skuse, 1894) has an opportunistic feeding behavior with preference for mammals in different ecological landscapes. However, little is known of the host-seeking behavior and how host selection affects Ae. albopictus. Previously, we found the sex and physiological stage of rats [Rattus norvegicus (Berkenhout), strain Wistar] affected the attraction of Ae. albopictus females. Here, we studied whether blood from different sexes and physiological stages of rats affected the reproduction of Ae. albopictus females in laboratory. The gonotrophic cycle of female mosquitoes fed blood from immature female rats was shorter than those fed blood from mature rats. Time to egg hatching ranged from 1.85 to 1.89 days. Mean time of larval development of Ae. albopictus varied from 8.44 to 8.50 days, and the mean time of duration of the pupal stage of Ae. albopictus varied from 2.01 to 2.07 days depending on the type of blood source the females were fed. The mean total time for development of immature Ae. albopictus was 10.48 to 10.50 days. Female mosquitoes laid more eggs, the percentage of eggs that hatched was greater, and emerged adults had a female-biased sex ratio when fed blood from immature female rats compared to those fed other rat sources of blood. Results of the study are relevant, considering Ae. albopictus might be a potential vector of zoonotic and human arboviruses.\n\nSome Orthoptera species have been studied for their large amounts of phenolic compounds and bioactive potential. This work focused on Pterophylla beltrani Bolívar & Bolívar as a source of compounds with bioactive potential. Concentrated ethanolic extract of P. beltrani was evaluated for antioxidant effects, protective potential of proteins against free radicals, and antimicrobial effects and was analyzed for tentative identification of metabolites. The extract showed total phenolic compounds, flavonoids, and antioxidant capacity. The antibacterial effect was greatest in Bacillus subtilis Cohn. An antifungal assay showed no inhibition of mycelial growth. No protective effect against degradation of proteins by free radicals was observed. Tandem mass spectrometry enabled tentative identification of derivatives of fatty acids, amino acid derivatives, alkaloids, phenolic compounds, terpenoids, piranocumarins, and fatty amides in the extract. Results highlight P. beltrani as a source of metabolites with bioactive potential for future applications.\n\nTomato (Solanum lycopersicum L.) plants have developed or adapted over time efficient defense mechanisms against insect attack. Because the mechanisms often fail to be effective enough, alternatives are needed to help counteract attacks by pests. Sodium menadione bisulfite (MBS), a compound derived from vitamin K3, possesses insecticidal properties. In this work, bioassays were done to verify insecticidal effect of MBS on Bactericera cockerelli (Sulc) and Bemisia tabaci (Gennadius). MBS killed more than 80 and 60% of the insects evaluated, with LC50 of 54.79 and 521.72 ppm, respectively. MBS also deformed B. cockerelli adults hatched from nymphs exposed to concentrations of MBS tested under in vitro conditions. Therefore, menadione can be considered an alternative for integrated management of B. cockerelli and B. tabaci.\n\nAn expert opinion survey was administered to document use and cost of insecticides applied to manage beet leafhopper, Circulifer tenellus (Baker), on potato, Solanum tuberosum L., and carrot, Daucus carota L., crops in the Columbia Basin region of Oregon and Washington. Estimated total average cost of beet leafhopper management was $56.33 in carrot and $41.71 per hectare in potato. Perceptions of lost yield attributable to damage by beet leafhopper varied greatly. Estimates of yield loss were 0 to 15% in carrot and 0 to 30% in potato.\n\nIn the order Hemiptera, leafhoppers are the most diverse family, with more than 25,000 species distributed worldwide. Leafhoppers (Auchenorrhyncha: Cicadellidae) are of phytosanitary importance, because they are efficient vectors of plant pathogens such as phytoplasmas and other bacteria and viruses that cause diseases in a wide range of plants. Citrus variegated chlorosis disease is caused by the bacteria Xyllela fastidiosa (Wells et al. 1987), currently distributed and causing problems in citrus crops in Argentina, Brazil, Paraguay, and Costa Rica. However, there are only a few studies of Mexican leafhoppers associated with disease and relationship with a host plant. This research focused on taxonomy of Cicadellidae mainly on species related to citrus plants (Rutaceae). As a result, 25 leafhopper species were identified on the Peninsula of Yucatan. But, only four species, according to the literature, were associated with citrus plants: Homalodisca sp., Oncometopia clarior (Walker851), Phera obtusifrons Fowler, 1899, and Hortensia similis (Walker,1851). The rest of the leafhopper species collected, apparently used citrus plants only as temporary habitat, although some might be important pests of other crops.\n\nAlfalfa (Medicago sativa L.) is attacked by pests that cause serious damage when not controlled. Among the insect pests are pea aphid, Acyrthosiphon pisum Harris; spotted alfalfa aphid, Therioaphis maculata Buckton; armyworm, Spodoptera exigua Hübner; alfalfa leafhopper, Empoasca fabae Harris; and three-cornered alfalfa hopper, Spissistilus festinus Say. In the Comarca Lagunera, insecticides seldom are used to control alfalfa pests that are regulated by beneficial insects. However, species that provide this service are little known. The objective of this study was to identify Trichogrammatidae collected with a sweep net each week from 3 March to 30 December 2011 in an alfalfa plot at the Unidad de Producción 18 de Julio at Universidad Autonoma Chapingo at Bermejillo, Durango. Species identified were Aphelinoidea nr. roja Triapitsyn 2005; Oligosita sanguina Girault 1911; Paracentrobia punctata Howard 1897; Ufens nr. simplipenis Owen 2005; and Trichogramma pretiosum Riley 1879. A. nr. roja, O. sangunea, P. punctata, T. pretiosum, and U. nr. simplipenis on alfalfa are new records for Mexico. With the exception of T. pretiosum, the other species are pest insects with sucking habits.\n\nBiological control using native parasitoids is a sustainable alternative to control tephritid flies. We tested whether landscape attributes surrounding guava trees might affect incidence of fruit flies and their parasitoids. From July to September 2019, we collected guava fruit at six locations at Nayarit, México. Pupae obtained from the fruit collected were reared in a laboratory until emergence of adult flies and parasitoids. We combined in situ georeferenced information with 2019 SPOT-7 satellite images to characterize the landscape in circular 500-m buffers. Spearman-rank tests were used to analyze correlation between abundance of Anastrepha striata and parasitoids with the proportion of each soil coverage. Mann-Whitney U and Kruskal-Wallis tests were used to evaluate the influence of management intensity with abundance of the fruit fly and parasitoids. We collected 15.7 kg of guava fruit from six localities. Anastrepha striata was at all localities sampled. Infestation of fruit was 9.4%, ranging from 0.5 to 35.2 larvae per kilogram. The four parasitic wasp species attacking A. striata were Doryctobracon areolatus, Trichopria drosophilae, Aceratoneuromyia indica, and Leptopilina boulardi and are new records of interactions in the State of Nayarit. The wasps attacked 7.5% of the fruit fly pupae.\n\nGalls or cecidia are a microhabitat for many wasp species of the family Cynipoidea. Diversity and richness of wasps of the Cynipini tribe were estimated indirectly from their microhabitat (gall). We also inferred the relationship between galls and environmental factors in the temperate forest of Sierra Fria, Aguascalientes. Ten sites were sampled; two permanent plots 50 × 50 m were established and sampled in rainy and dry seasons at every site. In each plot, presence, and abundance of galls in oaks were quantified, as well as weather and geographical data. Richness and alfa (Hill series) and beta (βtotal, βrepl, and βrich) diversity were determined per period, site, and host level. Canonical correspondence analysis was used to evaluate effects of environmental factors on wasp richness. A total richness of 78 galls was found, which could represent 35 to 40 wasp species. Differences in abundance and diversity were found among sites, hosts, and time periods. βtotal showed variation in diversity was explained by replacement of species rather than differences in richness. Species richness and hosts were affected by weather and geographical variables. Use of galls as an indirect indication of richness and diversity, host-parasite interaction, and its environmental interaction were discussed for conservation purposes.\n\nTriatoma nitida Usinger es vector del parásito Trypanosoma cruzi (Chagas) causante de la enfermedad de Chagas, con alta capacidad de adaptación a zonas con diferencias geográficas y climáticas, lo que podría llegar a afectar a la población humana. Considerando la problemática actual de las enfermedades reemergentes el presente estudio se realizó con los objetivos de delimitar la distribución actual de T. nitida en Latinoamérica, identificar las variables ambientales de mayor influencia sobre la distribución de la especie para el clima futuro (2041-2060 y 2081-2100) bajo los escenarios SSP1-2.6 y SSP5-8.5 (GtCO2) e identificar las nuevas zonas con alta idoneidad de hábitat. Se generó una base de datos con 55 registros geográficos. Se descargaron 19 variables bioclimáticas del periodo actual con resolución de 2.5 arc-min. Para la proyección del clima futuro se consideró el modelo de Beijing Climate Center-Climate System Model para los años 2041-2060 y 2081-2100 bajo los escenarios SSP1-2.6 y SSP5-8.5. La superficie estimada para Latinoamérica fue de 2,089,284 km2, abarcando 17 países y 13 estados de México con zonas potenciales para la presencia de la especie. La superficie estimada para los climas futuros fue de 205,515 km2 para 2041-2060 y de 857 km2 para 2081-2100, siendo la mayor distribución en los estados de Oaxaca y Chiapas en México y los países centro y sudamericanos Guatemala, El Salvador, Honduras, Nicaragua, Venezuela, y Brasil. Se puede señalar que bajo este modelo la tendencia de disminución del área de distribución de T. nitida representa un menor riesgo epidemiológico para la población humana. Aunque la tendencia de los resultados muestran dicha disminución, se encontraron nuevas zonas geográficas de invasión las cuales poseen características climáticas ideales para el establecimiento del vector, lo que podría contribuir a su adaptación, incrementar su capacidad vectorial, así como ampliar la distribución de la enfermedad de Chagas a nuevas zonas de Latinoamérica, por lo anterior es importante considerar las áreas con alta idoneidad de hábitat.\n\nEn los últimos diez años la producción de café en Guatemala ha sido afectada por la mosca del Mediterráneo, la cual acelera el proceso de maduración del fruto, con la caída temprana del grano y menor calidad comercial. Recientes resultados de investigación han ofrecido una nueva alternativa para el monitoreo con el atrayente CeraTrap®. En un ensayo en el municipio de Acatenango, Dept. de Chimaltenango, Guatemala fue evaluada la efectividad biológica de botellas Pet con atrayente CeraTrap y las aspersiones terrestres de GF-120 (Spinosad), para el control masivo de C. capitata. Los datos muestran que al usar estaciones cebo tipo botellas Pet con 200 ml de CeraTrap a razón de 25 trampas por hectárea, se logró contener la incidencia de tres picos poblaciones de las moscas hembras y machos entre los meses de marzo-abril logrando una densidad final de 1,767 y 0.69, respectivamente. Mientras que siete aspersiones de GF-120 tuvieron registros elevados con menor reducción de la plaga: 4,802 y 2.26. La efectividad biológica calculada indica que las botellas Pet con CeraTrap produjeron un control total de adultos del 74.1%, superando a GF-120 quien solo obtuvo una efectividad 39.4%.\n\nDiversity of beetles collected with flight interception traps at Parque Estatal Bosque de Arce, Talpa de Allende, Jalisco, Mexico was studied. Sampling was done during dry and wet seasons. In total, 3,857 individuals of 29 families, 214 morphospecies, and 73 genera were collected. Two sites, one with great diversity in the spring and the other with greatest diversity in winter, were sampled. Most abundance and species richness at both sites were in summer. Complementarity values near 1 and low similarity of the beetle assemblage between seasons and sites, described different composition between sites and increased diversity at the landscape level in the forest. Four beetle species and two new genera records were recorded for the State of Jalisco.\n\nThere is insufficient knowledge of wild plant hosts of the tomato/potato psyllid, Bactericera cockerelli, one of the worst pests of solanaceous crops. We found B. cockerelli can complete its life cycle in the field on the widespread, unreported plant host, greenleaf five eyes, Chamaesaracha coronopus (Dunal) A. Gray (Solanaceae) at Galeana, NL, Mexico. After 48 hours in a laboratory, adult survival of B. cockerelli on C. coronopus and Chamaesaracha coniodes was 73.3 and 6.6%, respectively (p < 0.05). There was no oviposition on C. coniodes. Some Chamaesaracha species might contribute to population dynamics of B. cockerelli in North America."
