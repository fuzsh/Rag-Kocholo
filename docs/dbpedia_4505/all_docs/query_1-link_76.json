        "text": "It's a tight contest, I admit.\n\nIn my opinion, Vargas even he played LB, his best was a LW/LM. That's why didn't get a call. Same as Solano.\n\nBenítez had a short but highly praised career in the NT, included a nominee in Best XI at Copa America 1959. Velasquez also had a great peak but won in longevity. But at club level, I get the edge to Benitez, who played very good in all leagues: Peru, Argentina & Italy. Velasquez was an absolute legend in Peru, but had a poor career overseas.\n\nSo, NT: Benitez<Velasquez, Club: Benitez>>Velasquez.\n\nIn Delgado's case he was among the top defenders in at least two Copa America, Melendez has 1 Copa America, even he won it, I considered more a team award than individual accolade. At club level, Melendez was moved to his CB role just a couple of years before he was signed in Argentina, and then get back to Perú after a severe injury. So, the peruvians didn't watch his best years at live, something that they did with Delgado. That's why most people rated Delgado above Melendez, maybe whether it exist Television back then, it would be the other way.\n\nSo, NT: Delgado>Melendez, Club: Delgado<Melendez.\n\nIn this case I gave the to Delgado because he had the complete package for a defender, he could be finest defender but also an athletic and rude player if needed.\n\nwhy do you say that he played well in italy? what made it \"good\"? was it that his team won the IC?\n\nBenitez did not play as much for Peru because of the rules of his days..overseas players cannot represent the country there is also not as much footage of Benitez as there is of the Paron, poeta and nene midfield...that would explain his fan favorite tag\n\ndont get the Didi midfield reference? his midfield was Challe and Mifflin\n\nCalderon was the coach in charge of Poeta, Patron and Cubillas\n\nIn the 1960s, Serie-A was arguably the strongest league in the world, they allow two foreign players in their clubs. Someone would be very good to be in. And Benitez stayed there for 8 years!\n\nhttp://forums.bigsoccer.com/threads/best-south-american-players-50s-60s.1383569/#post-20346445\n\nhttp://forums.bigsoccer.com/threads...he-americas-ever.1320185/page-4#post-19885958\n\nHe was starter for Milan in the semifinal and final match in the EC 1963 and also the final match in the IC. He played for both, the greatest italian clubs at the time AC Milan and Inter, also spent some seasons in minnow clubs, but he did it good there (in one of them he was captain, too), that he was resigned the next season for the big two. In this video he scored one in Milan Derby (being a DM).\n\nHere some contemporary sources, rating him as a \"good\" player, not necessarily extraordinary when playing there.\n\nhttp://www.magliarossonera.it/protagonisti/Gioc-Benitez.html\n\nDiego came back for the 95 apertura, along with Cannigia. There were lots of changes after the 95 clausura. That is when Kili Gonzalez made his debut as well. I still cannot believe that team with Diego didn't win the title. They finished second to Bianchi's Velez.\n\nYeah, the one with Caniza and Gamarra was the most common one, both at the qualifiers and the WC. At eliminatorias and WC 2002 they were usually lining up with three center backs, Arce and Caniza as fullbacks, three midfielders (Acuña in the middle) and two forwards.\n\nHere's one from 2006\n\nWhile we wait I want to share an anecdote from Argentine football tangentially related to Roberto Matosas. For our friends who are not South American, this might bring a bit of a window into our crazy futbol culture.\n\nBack in the sixties when Roberto Matosas was one of the referents at River, there was this young woman, large, obnoxious and overbearing, who used to be a feature at every River Plate game, and after every match she would always ask Matosas for his jersey. Finally after one match, Matosas gave it to her. Since that day, for the rest of her life (until her death in 1996) the woman went to every River game wearing his jersey, cut up to fit her large size, and she became know as \"La Gorda Matosas\", (The fat woman Matosas).\n\nLa Gorda Matosas became a symbol at River and a sort of de-facto cheerleader, both loving her team and hating Boca, and hating Diego Maradona in particular from the time he chose to play at Boca over River. Sometimes she would also go to Boca matches to support whoever was playing against Boca.\n\nHer story is that she became an orphan at age 5, and River became her life. She once said: \"Mi único amor es River. River es mi novio, mi marido, mi amante... y con eso tengo bastante\". (My only love is River. River is my boyfriend, my husband, my lover...and with that I have enough.)\n\nLa gorda Matosas became a target of opposing fans, who would sing vulgar songs about her, and she replied in kind, with vulgar language and gestures. She became an integral part of the experience whenever River played, and to this day she is remembered by both friends and foes as a symbol of River. Interestingly, Boca Juniors also had a similar fan referent, a very masculine and vulgar woman known as \"La Raulito\", about whom a movie was made. I have to say, though, that compared to \"La Gorda Matosas\", \"La Raulito\" was a princess.\n\nYears after he retired, Roberto Matosas was asked by a journalist about his time at River Plate, to which he quipped, \"At River la Gorda Matosas is more famous than I am\".\n\nLA GORDA MATOSAS\n\nI suppose since I already sold my soul and got all these gayina players, I can draft La Gorda Matosas to be my team's number one fan.\n\n14: Peñarol (Uruguay)\n\nBENGOECHEA, Pablo (AM, CM | Uruguay)\n\nCAETANO, Omar (SB | Uruguay)\n\nGESTIDO, Álvaro (SB, DM | Uruguay)\n\nGONÇALVES, Néstor (DM |

This is a opinion for many peruvian old timers.\n\nWhile we wait, I'd like present an all-time Libertadores XI, I think is very well picked and described, albeit in Spanish.\n\nhttp://www.eluniverso.com/2009/02/08/1/1429/EEEF66AD428245638700EB98D8F85826.html\n\nEl puesto de arquero es, justamente, el más controvertido. Elegimos a Éver Almeida por ser un notable golero, doble campeón (1979 y ’90), atajador y rematador de penales, decisivo en las conquistas de Olimpia y hombre récord de la competencia (16 años y 113 partidos). Sin dudas, Higuita, Henao, Chilavert, Rogerio Ceni, Zetti, Manga y Santoro le pisan los talones en calidad y rendimiento, sin embargo, el uruguayo-paraguayo es el indiscutible arquero de la historia. Éver parecía el perfecto antiatleta, pero fue un maravilloso evitador de goles (por si acaso, la misión esencial de un guardameta).\n\nDos brasileños se disputan el lateral derecho: Cafú y Nelinho. Elegimos al primero por ser bicampeón y por representar a un equipo histórico: el San Pablo de Telé. Pero haber visto los bombazos teledirigidos de Nelinho es toda una fortuna. Pablo Forlán (Peñarol), Chiqui Arce (Gremio, Palmeiras), el Negro Ibarra (Boca Juniors) son otros referentes del puesto.\n\nHugo De León, triple ganador con Nacional y Gremio, caudillo con clase y estampa, y Francisco Sa, hexacampeón, gran intuitivo en la marca, es la dupla de zagueros. La zaga es, quizás, donde menos estrellas recuerda la Copa. El lateral izquierdo debería ser unánime: el uruguayo Ricardo Pavoni, sangre charrúa, fabuloso en el mano a mano, abonado al gol, capitán, ganador, impasable. Junior, campeón con Flamengo en el ’81, es otra mención ineludible, pero el Chivo ganó cinco copas. Más que eso: Pavoni “es” la Libertadores. Incuestionable.\n\nTodos los que jugaron o enfrentaron a Pedro Virgilio Rocha tienen un concepto unánime: fue un crack. Reunía técnica, potencia y gol. Coronado con Peñarol (’61 y ’66), ídolo en el San Pablo, es el “8” ideal de la Copa. Y un caballero de las canchas.\n\nZito, esclarecido distribuidor de juego del Santos, es el centromedio titular. Jugaba o raspaba, según viniera la mano. Para Pelé, “un fenómeno”. Claudio Marangoni, exquisito volante de Independiente en 1984, fue otro excepcional exponente del círculo central. Claudio lucía más, pero Zito era el comandante de la victoria.\n\nRicardo Bochini es “el” 10, entre varios prodigios como Zico, Riquelme o Francescoli. Además de genio, Bochini los aventaja en números: ganó cuatro coronas, siempre como figura esencial. Es hereje excluir a Riquelme (conductor cerebral y tricampeón con Boca), sin embargo, no alcanza la estatura de jugador del Bocha.\n\nDos veces jugó la Libertadores, en ambas fue campeón, en una goleador. Imparable, insuperable. Si aún no bastara con eso, digamos su nombre y termina todo: Pelé.\n\nEl equipo de todos los tiempos arranca con un ecuatoriano y diez más. Es Alberto Spencer. El 9 de la marca irrepetible: 54 goles. Y por si acaso, tricampeón (1960, ’61 y ’66). Palhinha, Fernando Morena, Raúl Vicente Amarilla, Hernán Crespo hicieron muchos goles vitales. Pero ni se acercan a Cabecita de Oro.\n\nLa punta izquierda la retiró del mercado Juan Ramón Verón el día que dejó el fútbol. La Bruja, tricampeón con Estudiantes (68-69 y ’70), era completo: hacía los goles, enloquecía al público, daba brillo a un equipo mañero y áspero. Un inmortal.\n\nQue quede claro: son los que más méritos hicieron en la Libertadores. No cuentan títulos mundiales ni otras hierbas. Pasemos en limpio: Almeida; Cafú, De León, Sa y Pavoni; Rocha, Zito, Pelé y Bochini; Spencer y Verón.\n\nTreinta y tres títulos en solo once jugadores. Cuatro uruguayos, tres brasileños, tres argentinos, un ecuatoriano. Cuadrazo del revés y del derecho.\n\nYet more evidence of the fact that Riquelme is generously underrated.\n\nRiquelme played in Europe from 2002 to 2006, four crucial years of his prime (including a Semi Final appearance in the 2005-06 Champions League), and yet Bochini gets the nod despite the fact that Bochini played his entire prime in South America. The truth is, Riquelme could've won the 2006 Copa Libertadores, that is, considering the fact that a lesser version of Riquelme did win the 2007 Copa Libertadores with Boca. Riquelme also would've almost certainly won another Copa Libertadores between 2002 and 2005, which would've taken his tally to 4 or 5 Copa Libertadores titles: that is, as many or more titles than Bochini, on top of having humbled Real Madrid at the Intercontinental Cup (2000).\n\nBochini gets the nod purely because of political reasons: he played his entire prime at the same club, in South America. Riquelme played 4 of his prime years in Europe, and yet he still came painfully close to winning 4 Copa Libertadores, and yet \"Riquelme no alcanza la estatura de jugador del Bocha.\" Most probably, Riquelme was as good or better than Bochini.\n\n\"es hereje no incluir riquelme\" means it's heresy not to include riquelme.\n\nthe only thing that separates bochini from riquelme, according to the writer, is the amount of titles.\n\nBochini suffered as much due to politics as it helped him. Remember Alonso being picked ahead of him in 78? Bochini was at his prime, yet disregarded because he was from Independiente, not River. Alonso got injured anyway, and a prime Bochini was left watching from the sidelines. Imagine how much his legacy could have increased if he was part of that WC winning team. Kempes gets all the glory but Bochini would have been a star in the tournament, without a doubt.\n\nIt wasn't surprising to see Maradona forced Bilardo to bring him on in 1986 semi final as a mark of respect and he wanted him involved in a WC win, which was robbed from him.\n\nAlso not surprising that the phrase 'pase bochinesco' is still used.\n\nI know you guys are discussing Copa Libertadores, but if there's anyone who has been stopped from being an all time legend here, it's Bochini.\n\nAs for the two, I'd like to know what Riquelme would have done in a match like the 1978 final when Bochini's Independiente was down to 8 men, thanks to some political interference again and he drove them to the win, scoring both the goals.\n\nThere's a lot to like about Riquelme but El Bocha's character is far superior than his. In my opinion.\n\nDude, Riquelme (during his prime) wasn't taken to the 2002 WC, and Argentina was eliminated in the Group Stage. Bochini not getting included into a WC winning Argentina team, how exactly is that worse than Riquelme not being included into the 2002 WC team nor into the 2010 WC team??\n\nAnd that proves that Bochini was better?? You just arbitrarily selected a highly specific situation, and then acted as though that conclusively proves some particular important point. In any case, I'd like to see Bochini play 4 of his prime years in Europe (23 years old, 24 years old, 25 years old, 26 years old, and 27 years old, all which Riquelme spent playing in Europe), and still win 3 Copa Libertadores, with a 4th Final that wasn't won.\n\nThe only thing that separates them, according to the writer, is the amount of titles that Bochini won after playing his entire career in South America, as compared to Riquelme spending the most crucial portion of his prime in Europe. That's a highly political argument imo."
