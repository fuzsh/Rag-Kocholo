        "text": "from the collection of the Museum of the City of New York\n\nIn the 18th century Elbert Herring's vast land holdings, known as the Herring Farm, stretched west from The Bowery to Christopher Street, and north from approximately today's Houston Street to Waverly Place. His estate was divided among his heirs, with Nicholas Herring inheriting the section of land bounded by Broadway (then known as Great George Street at this point) east to Lafayette Place. He quickly sold the land on May 12, 1789 to Anthony L. Bleecker for $812, who divided it into fourteen building lots.\n\nNo. 714 was purchased by Smith Ely. A member of the legal firm Bartlett & Ely, he was married to the former Abigail Belknap Bartlett. The couple had a daughter Adelaide V.\n\nIn the meantime, John Moon had purchased No. 716, and immediately leased it to Philip and Catharine Dunscomb Hone. Hone had served as mayor of New York City in 1826-27. A wealthy merchant, he was a founder of the Mercantile Library Association and the first president of the Delaware and Hudson Canal Company. Like his neighbors, he and Catharine had moved northward with the tide of fashion. They had previously lived in an elegant residence on Broadway across from City Hall Park.\n\nIt is a marked, peculiar, and striking likeness of the original--with great and extraordinary merit as a work of art. The young artist has thrown into the features of Mr. H., a great deal more intellectual expression than we ever saw the original breath forth in Wall street or at the dinner table.\n\nThe Financial Panic of 1837 seriously affected Smith Ely and John Moon. Both houses were lost in foreclosure in 1841. On April 30 auctioneer E. H. Ludlow auctioned the Elys' \"elegant furniture\" on the premises of \"No. 714 Broadway, Marble Colonade Building.\" Included were mahogany parlor furniture, two pier mirrors which had cost $365 in 1836 (more than $10,000 today), and a \"city-made Piano Forte.\"\n\nCharles Goadsby Ferris died in his marble mansion on July 10, 1848. Catherine and Caroline Adelia remained in the house, joined by Caroline's husband Glover Clapham whom she married in 1850. Clapham died within a year of their wedding and in 1851 Caroline married Samuel Lewis\n\nIn the meantime, No. 714 had been home to physician Francis E. Berger, who sold it in 1852 to another doctor, Samuel S. Fitch. Drs. Calvin M. and Josiah P. Fitch worked in their father's practice, and Calvin lived in the house with his parents.\n\nDr. S. S. Fitch, author of six lectures on the prevention and cure of consumption, asthma, diseases of the heart, &c, has removed his office from 787 Broadway to 714 Broadway. All examinations of the chest and heart and whole case, and medical opinion and advise, always gratis.\n\nMeanwhile, Samuel and Caroline Adelia Lewis continued to occupy No. 716. In 1874 son Samuel Ferris Lewis was a sophomore at Columbia University and his brother Charles Ferris Lewis was studying at Columbia University's Law School."
