        "text": "Jonathan Trumbull, Sr. Papers\n\nA Guide to the Jonathan Trumbull, Sr. Papers at the Connecticut Historical Society\n\nCollection Overview\n\nRepository : Connecticut Historical Society Creator : Jonathan Trumbull, Sr. Title : Jonathan Trumbull, Sr. Papers. Dates : 1637 - 1787 Extent : 4.5 linear feet (11 boxes) Abstract : Collection consists of personal and business correspondence; bills and accounts; sermon notes, diaries, and legal documents. Location: Manuscript stacks Language: English\n\nBiographical Sketch\n\nJonathan Trumbull, Sr. was born on October 12, 1710 in Lebanon, Connecticut, the second son of Joseph and Hannah (Higley) Trumble (sic). He received his early education from the second minister of the town, Samuel Welles. Welles moved to Boston shortly before Trumbull reached university age, which might explain why he attended Harvard instead of Yale, which was both nearer to home and less expensive. He completed his studies in 1727 and by 1731 was considering serving as Minister in Colchester, Connecticut. His plans were thwarted, however, by the death at sea of his elder brother, Joseph, and Jonathan took his brother's place in the family business.\n\nFour years later, on December 9, 1735, Jonathan Trumbull married Faith Robinson, daughter of Rev. John Robinson of Duxbury, Massachusetts. Together they had four sons and two daughters.\n\nOver the decades, Trumbull developed an extensive trading business. Unlike most colonial traders, who went through middle men in New York and Boston, he established direct connections with merchants in Great Britain. By the 1760s, Trumbull's business was very successful. However, in 1766 he began to suffer irreparable losses in trade and by 1769 he was virtually bankrupt and retired from business.\n\nDespite his compromised financial position, the General Assembly of Connecticut elected Trumbull governor in 1769 upon the death of William Pitkin. Trumbull had enjoyed a long career in politics and public service, having first entered the General Assembly in 1733 and having served as a speaker in 1739. At the start of the hostilities with Great Britain in 1775, Trumbull was the only governor to support the position of the colonies. He had long been a supporter of colonial rights and during the war supplied General Washington with food, clothing, and munitions. Trumbull remained in the governor's seat until his retirement in 1784. His distinguished life came to an end on August 17, 1785.\n\nReturn to the Table of Contents\n\nScope and Content\n\nCollection consists largely of correspondence, letters, and supporting material written in both personal and official roles.
