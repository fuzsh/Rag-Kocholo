        "text": "Notes for Maj. James Fitch\n\n“res. Norwich, New London Co., CT”. 1006\n\n“Res. Saybrook, Norwich, Preston, Plainfield, and Canterbury, Conn. Major in Indian Wars; Representative Conn. General Court; Assistant, 1681. He gave glass and nails for the first building of Yale College, and in 1701 gave 637 acres of and to the college.” 1729\n\nRegarding his marriage date to Elizabeth Mason, “The printed version of Torrey Marriages says the date was Jan. 1670. In his original mss. - although it is easy to see how a transcriber might have read it as 1670 - it is just as easy to read it as 1676, which agrees with the printed version of the Norwich VF, cited here.” 1006\n\n“The Will of James Fitch Senior, [his father] made 7 Feb. 1695/6, proved at Norwich, 2 Dec. 1702, named his son James . . . “ 556\n\n“James, Jr., the oldest child, was undoubtedly the most famous of the fourteen children of Rev. James. He was dubbed ‘Black James’ by some, and, according to contemporary quotations, was the author of ‘open and scandalous villanies’ and ‘a great land pirate.’ In 1680 and again in 1684, while James, Sr., was still very much alive, James, Jr., persuaded Owaneco, son of Uncas and a sachem of the Mohegans, to accept him as guardian and to vest title of Quinebaug County - some one million acres - in himself. In 1686, he sold 15,100 acres of his land for Â£30 to form the town of Pomfret, Windham Co., CT. In 1687, he received more land from Owaneco, comprising parts of Plainfield and Canterbury, both Windham Co., CT, the latter being a town he founded and to which he removed in 1697. And, as one of Joshua’s legatees (Joshua was the Christian name of Attawanhood, brother of Owaneco), James obtained 5000 acres in Windham and Willimantic in Windham Co., and Mansfield in Tolland Co. By 1698, when his enemy, Major Fitz John Winthrop, became governor, James, Jr., lost his seat on the Council, to which he had been elected in 1680. Because of the questionable validity of all the Indian grants, he was accused of being ‘exceedingly busy selling the lands of this colony.’ Figure 4 [on file] shows his signature and seal on an indenture, dated 7 May 1686, in which he sold Indian lands in eastern Cannecticut and adjoining parts of Massachusetts to Samuel Shrimpton and Wait Winthrop.” 1006\n\n“Not long after his father’s death, James, Jr. was in trouble, not only with the state, but the church as well. On 9 April 1704, ‘Maj. James Fitch being guilty of drunkeness made public confession thereof and was reconciled to ye Church.’ In 1717, the Council issued a warrant for his arrest. In respoonse he wrote ‘I do freely confess that I have . . . acted very indiscretely and disrespectfully to his honor the Governor [and] am heartily sorry and condemn myself therefore.’ He then retired to his home in Canterbury, where he died ten years later.” 1006\n\n“On the credit side of the ledger, James was an early patron of Yale College, where he is memorialized in an archway. He served in the army, rising during the King Philip’s War to the rank of Major. He was also, at one time, a magistrate in New London, New London Co., CT, though even in that role, not without controversy (one time he apparently fined three men on the basis of a grand jury indictment, without bothering to wait for a trial). He married twice: first, Elizabeth Mason (his step-mother’sister) and second, a widow, Mrs. Alice (Bradford) Adams. He and his first wife had four children; he and his second wife had eight.” 1006\n\n“They settled at Norwich, where he was elected one of the assistants of the Colony of Conn. in 1681.”1707\n\n“The first Commissioner of Justice appointed by the General Court for the town was ensign John Mason, 1672. . . In 1678, James Fitch and Thomas Tracy.” 1732\n\n“Thomas Leffingwell held a Lieutenant’s commission in 1676, and performed active service against the Indians, but did not succeed to the captaincy. The highest civil officer, assistant or magistrate of the town, probably had a prior claim, as in May, 1680, James Fitch was confirmed Captain of the Norwich train-band, Thomas Leffingwell Lieutenant, and William Backus Ensign.”\n\n“After the death of his first wife, Major James Fitch removed to Canterbury, Conn., and m. 8 May 1687, Mrs. Alice (Bradford) Adams, dau. of Major William Bradford of Plymouth, and his first wife Alice Richards; and grand dau. of Gov. William Bradford of the Mayflower.”1707\n\n“Major James’s gravesone in the Canterbury burying ground, shown in Figure 5 reads:\n\n‘Here Lies the Body of Majr. James Fitch, Esqr. Son of ye Revd Mr James Fitch Postor first of Baybrook then of Norwch. He was born at Saybrook 1647 He was very Useful in his Military & in His Magistracy to which he was chosen & Served Successively many years to ye Greate Acceptance & advantage of His Country being A Gentleman of Good Parts & very forward to Promote ye Civil and Religous interest of it He Died Novr 10 1727 Ageed 80.’ [The ‘aged 80 on the g.s. results from using a birth in 1647, a year before his parents were married. According to Rev. James(1)’s own entries in both the Saybrook LR and Norwich VF, James (2) was actually born Aug. 1649 and was, therefore, 78 years old when he died].”1006\n\n“The Winthrop brothers dubbed him ‘Black James’ and described him as a leader of ‘rude fellows of desperate fortune’ as well as the author of ‘open and scandalous villanies.’ Two of his fellow magistrates labeled him ‘a great land pirate,’ worse than Wat Tyler or robin Hood, and asked the General Assembly to ‘seriously consider how pernicious’ he was to ‘the rising generation in this colony.’ Sir Henry Ashurst damnedhim as ‘the Cananite . .. in your land.’ The object of this obloquy from the genteel was James Fitch, politician, land speculator, and disturber of the established order in colonial Connecticut.” 1727\n\n“Fitch rose rapidly in the public affairs of his locality and colony. In 1679 he was elected a norwich deputy to the General Court. The ligislature itself acknowledged his promise by appointing him a magistrate for the town and treasurer of New London County. . . In 1680 and again in 1684, Fitch was able to persuade Owaneco to accept him as his guardian and to vest in him title to a great tract of land called the Quinebaug Country. If Fitch could in some manner perfect his possession of this great tract of more than one million acres, he would be the greatest land magnate in New England. . . .In 1680 Fitch was elected to a coveted seat on the Connecticut Council and appeared to be on the verge of becoming a commanding figure in the colony. . . One irritating problem was the competing claim of the brothers Wait Still and Fitz John Winthrop to the Quinbaug lands. . . The other threat, appearing suddenly at mid-decade was the plan of the Stuart kings to bring rational order to their New World possessions by consolidation of the independent provinces of New England under a royal governor. . . [After the fall of the Dominion], In April 1689 the old leaders of the colony preferred a policy of inaction while testing the political winds, but Fitch agitated for an immediate meeting of the freemen. . .During these year, Fitch’es private enterprises also flourished. his opponants complained that he was ‘exceedingly busy in selling the lands of this colony. . . [In 1698] not only had his public and private enemy been elected governor, but the voters did not return Fitch to the Council. . . In 1700 Fitch regained his seat in the Upper House and began a long campaign to undermine public confidence in the governor and the old magistrates. . .. .Despite his ability to continually vex his enemies, Fitch was losing control of events and was at last ousted from the Quinebaug lands. . . Left out of the Quinebaug settlement, a disgruntled Fitch retired from public affairs for a period. . . [In 1717] Endless lawsuits and title disputes had brought Fitch into financial difficulties, and he began selling land in the Wabbaquasset country, a portion of the Mehegan lands whose title he had been denied by the Assembly. . . The Contil confidently took up the challenge and issued a warrant for the arrest of the ‘scandalous and seditious’ Fitch. Lameness prevented Fitch’s arrest . . . Resolution of the conflict was finally provided by Fitch himself. His land titles as frail as his health, the old rebel wearily admitted that ‘upon due consideration of matters and things appearing to me now with another fact than at the time when I labored under great temptations, [I] do freely confess that I have in so doing acted very indiscretely and disrespectfully to his honor the Governor, am heartily sorry and condemn myself therefore. Not satisfied to have Fitch ‘on the stool of repentence,’ the governor pressed for a Â£20 fine, but the Lower House insisted the confession was adequate and the farcical episode was ended. Stripped any any remaining illusions regarding his influence, Fitch retired to Canterbury where he died on 10 November 1727.” 1727\n\n“Three acres of Mr. Fitch’s home-lot he afterward transferred to his son, Capt. James Fitch.” 1732\n\nThe Patent of the Town of Norwich, A.D. 1685 lists “Mr. James Fitch senr, Capt. James Fitch” as two of the proprietors of the township of Norwich and grants them land. [text to be entered] 1732\n\n“Few persons of that period had more influence in this part of the colony than Captain, or as he was afterwards styled, Major Fitch. He was a noted friend and patron to the Indians, and after the death of Major Mason, possessed more sway over the sachems than any other individual, not excepting their other distinguished advocate, Capt. Samuel Mason. The signature of Owaneco, subsequent to the year 1680, was considered of no value unless countersigned by Capt. Fitch; the Sachem, with the consent of the General Court, having authorized him to act as his guardian. [Copy of signature from 1682 on file]. Major Fitch stands forth remarkably prominent in connection with the landed interest of eastern Connecticut. He was noted as a land-surveyor, land-registrar, land-speculator, and a land-holder to an immense extent. By legiislative grants, by purchase from other grantees, and intimate connection with the Indian sachems, he accumulated a vast number of acres. In 1684, he obtained from Owaneco the native right and title to a broad tract of unsettled land, comprised under the general name of ‘the Nipmug and Wabaquassuck countreys.’ The southern line of this territory, beginning at the Quinnabaug river, north of the present town of Brooklyn, and running west, was estimated at forty-five miles, and from this western point the line running north extended beyond the northern boundary of Massachusetts. Out of this tract, the town of Pomfret was purchased of Capt. Fitch for thirty pounds. It was called the Mashamoquet Purchase, and consisted of fifteen thousand one hundred acres, which was assigned by Fitch to certain proprietors, May 5, 1686, the deed being countersigned by Owaneco and Josiah. In 1687, Owaneco conveyed to Major Fitch, parcels of land in the towns of Plainfield and Canterbury, of such extent as also to be measured by miles. A mortgage deed, executed in favor of Simeon Stoddard of Boston, Nov. 19, 1691, maps out a portion of Major Fitch’s accumulated land claims.\n\n1st. A tract ‘in the crotch of the rivers /showtuckett and Queenabauge,’ a mile and a fourth on one river, and nearly three miles on the other, now the southern part of Lisbon. 2d. Four thousand acres, in two parts: two thousand on each side of the Quinebaug, int he present towns of Plainfield and canterbury. 3d. Five thousand acres, in two parts, lying south of New Roxbury, alias Woodstock. 4th. A cultivated farm of two hundred acres in Preston.\n\nFollowing Major Fitch by his various deeds on record, we might suppose that during a part of his life he changed his local habitation with every revolution of the sun. On one occasion he is spoken of as an inhabitant of Preston.\n\nIn 1697, he writes himself, ‘I, James Fitch of Norwich.’\n\nIn 1698, ‘I James Fitch of Peagscomsuck.’ [Deed recorded at Norwich]\n\nIn 1699, ‘I James Fitch of Kent, alias Peagscomset.’ [Deed recorded at New London]\n\nin 1701, ‘I James Fitch of Plainfield.’\n\nIn 1703, ‘I James Fitch of Canterbury.’\n\nBut through Major Fitch had farms and dwelling-houses in several townships,and seems to have circulated freely through his possessions, he retained his connection with Norwich as a legal inhabitant down to the year 1697. He then removed his family to Peagscomsuck, in the Quinebaug river, - a plantation that he designed should be called Kent. The name, however, obtained but a limited currency, and was soon changed to Canterbury. Of this town he was pre-eminently the founder. He purchased the land, made the first clearings, laid it out in farms and house-lots, and built himself the first barn and the first framed house within its limits. He drew after him from Norwich other substantial settlers: the names of Backus, Bradford and Tracy appearing early upon the annals of the town. Canterbury and Plainfield grew up like twin plantations, side by side. Major Fitch was one of the first proprietors in each. . . Major Fitch and his brother Daniel were highly esteemed as brave soldiers and experienced partizans in Indian warfare. In the summer of 1696, a band of Mohawks committed some depredations on the western in Massachusetts, and a rumor having reached Capt. Fitch that a party of them had been seen skulking about Woodstock, he hastened from his farm to Norwich, collected a band of whites and Mohegans, and plunged into the forests in pursuit of the enemy. From Woodstock, he sent a part of his force under his brother Daniel, to range the woods further to the west, which they did, scouring country as far as Oxford, Worcester, and Lancaster. Tradition and record give intimations of one defect in the character of the gallant Major. He could not always resist the temptation to convivial excess, but he appears to have had the Christian grace to acknowledge the fault when committed, and repent of it. He continued his connection with the Norwich church long after his removal to canterbury, and perhaps till his death. He was under the temporary discipline of the Norwich church in 1704. Yale College honors Major Fitch as one of its earliest patrons. He contributed to the funds gathered for its first establishment, gave the glass and nails for the college edifice, and endowed it with 637 acres of land in the town of Killingly. He was twice married, and had thirteen children. . . Major Fitch died in Canterbury, Nov. 10th, 1727. “ 1732\n\n“By a deed of trust, Dec. 22, 1680, Owaneco assigned to James Fitch, Jr., the care and disposition of all his lands on Quinebaug river. A few years later, absolute deeds of sale of these and other tracts of land were executed by the sachem in favor of the same Capt. Fitch. In 1695, Owaneco and Capt. Samuel Mason, who, by his own choice and the authority of the government, had been appointed his trustee, requested that a committee of the town should be empowered to survey the 300 acre grant and fix its bounds. The next year, Capt. Fitch, being then proprietary clerk, recorded the whole grant to himself, as included int he large purchases he had made of Owaneco in 1684 and 1687. The town entered a formal protest against the claims of Capt. Fitch, particularly to the 300 acres at Quinebaug Falls, which had been guarantied to the Indians with a proviso that it should not be alienated. The course of Capt. Fitch in regard to these Indian purchases was distasteful to the town, and no clear account can be given of the basis upon which the difficulty was settled. Apparently the town, after some murmuring, acquiesced in the claim of Capt. Fitch to what was called the 1800 acre grant. Capt. Fitch sold this grant in 1694 and ‘95, to certain purchasers from Ipswich, Mass., vix., Joseph Safford, Richard Smith, Meshach Farley, Matthew Perkins, and Samuel Bishop.”1732\n\n“In 1686, Capt. James Fitch, the first of these grantees was allowed sufficient land near the water side to accommodate a wharf and warehouse. Not long afterward, Capt. Caleb Bushnell obtained a similar grant. These facilities were near the mouth of Yantic Cove. It was here that the wharfing, cuilding, and commercial enterprise of Norwich Landing began.” 1732\n\n“After the death of Joshua, his son and heir, Abimilech Joshuason, claimed the greater part of what is now Lebanon. In 1693, he gave a power of attorney to Major James Fitch and Lieut. Thomas Leffingwell, to settle the bounds between his land and the towns of Norwich and Windham.”1732\n\nText of deed from Major James Fitch to his son Theophilus dated 8 May 1722 to be entered. “Plainfield June the 20th 1722 the subscriberhere unto Major James Fitch Esqr personally appeared and acknowledged this above written deed to be his free act and deed before me Timothy peirce Justice of ye peace Received this deed July ye 6th 1722 and truly recorded pr me, Joseph Admas Town Clerk.” 1708\n\n“I also attribute two new pieces to Franklin: the satiric preface to the wonderfully bad poem by Major James Fitch on the Connecticut apostasy, 11 March, and the class-conscious essay by \"Dingo,\" 15 July, which contains the first use of an Afro-American personae in American literature.” 1736\n\nThe satiric preface to Major James Fitch’s poem is as follows:\n\n“Mr. Dryden obferes, That the Pindarick Verfe allows more Latitude than any other: And Mr. Norris fays, That the Nature of it is to be loof and free, and not to keep one fettled Pace, but fometimes like an impetuous Stream to bear down all before it. this is undoubtedly true of Kitelick Poetry; and a greater onour is not due to Pindar, than to the Immortan Dr. H_____k, the firft Inventer of this fort of Verfe, the Numbers of which are as boundlefs as thofe of the pindarick. Yet upon the firft Appearance of the Doctor’s Elegy on Mrs. Kitel, this Kind of Verfe was thought capable of Improvement; and as great Wits will not want Imitators, the Honourable Major James Fitch Efq; has exercis’d his Talent this way, and (I think) brought Kitelick Poetry to Perfection. And tho’ the Major’s Fame begins in his old Age, yet what Ovid fays of Aratur,\n\nGum Sole et Luna femper Aratus erit,\n\nmay properly be apply’d to this Honourable Verfifyer. His Poem was occafion’d by the late Revolution in Connecticut, and all wrote in the Month of October, as appears by its being dated twice in that Month. It has been communicated to me, with a Defire to have it made publick, and I fhall prefent it to my Readers as a perfect Pattern for all Kitelick Poets. It is as follows.\n\n‘Oh! now alas, alas, what’s come to pafs\n\nIn our Horizon?\n\n‘Tis frange for to tell, five Stars are now fell;\n\nAnd a very great one . . .\n\nAnd is it not to our Sorrow a great Aggravation,\n\nThat fuch in our College had their Education?\n\nThat out of that Mother of Learning did fpring,\n\nThat fhould her Sons and Churches mortally fting.\n\nAlas for us, who gave to the College fo willingly,\n\nCould we in that Day fuch a great Evil efpy?\n\nAnd to the Rector my Donation,\n\nWas it to go and get a new Ordination?\n\nNo, No, nothing fo.\n\nBut we hope God will accept our good Will therein;\n\nSo it is not ours, but heirs great Sin.\n\nWritten by the Honourable Major James Fitch Efq; of Canterbury. ‘ [Full text of poem to be entered] 1737\n\n“On 12 Jan. 1721/2 James Fitch of Canterbury sold to John Dyer 12 acres and on 28 March 1723 he sold to his son-in-law John Dyer all his land in Canterbury not otherwise disposed of.” 536\n\n“James Fitch of Canterbury gave or sold land to his son Ebenezer three times: 90 acres (part of Majr Fitches Farm) 13 April 1711, 3 pieces 9 March 1912, and 650 acres 4 Aug. 1714. On 29 Jan. 1712/3 Ebenezer Fitch of Windsor returned the land from the first deed to his father and sold the three pieces in the second deed to John Fitch of Windham and William Whiting of Hartford.” 536\n\n“James Fitch served in King Philip’s War and was an assistant in 1681.” 536\n\n“On 7 April 1710 James Fitch of Canterbury, Esq., sold land in Little Compton which he had bought in 1703.\n\nOn 9 March 1712 James Fitch of Canterbury gave his son Ebenezer Fitch of Canterbury 3 pieces of land; Ebenezer was of Windsor when he sold this land on 29 Jan. 1712/3. On $ Aug. 1714 James gave Ebenezer more land. On 4 Feb. 1719 James gave his son Daniel Fitch of Canterbury 350 acres. On 8 May 1722 James sold to son Theophilus Fitch land in Canterbury. On 29 June 1722 James gave his son Jabez Fitch of Canterbury 100 acres. And on 28 March 1723 James sold his son-in-law John Dyar all land in Canterbury not otherwise disposed of.” 536\n\n“No Windham, Conn., probate records were found for James Fitch.” 536\n\n“It has long been known that Major James Fitch, in order to avoid the expense and trouble of probate, did not leave a will, but, instead, disposed of his property by deeding it to his children, subject to an agreement with them that they would support himand his wife as long as they lived. From the above document, it would seem that the two surviving children by his first wife, Elizabeth Mason, namely Jedediah who removed to Nantucket, and Samuel, who resided at Jamaica, Long Island, were not parties to this agreement, although they had no doubt been well provided for at the time of their marriage.”1708\n\nExtension of notes notes for Maj.
