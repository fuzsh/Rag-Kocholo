        "text": "What Is Fitch Ratings?\n\nFitch Ratings is an international credit rating agency based in New York City and London. Investors use the company's ratings to determine which investments are less likely to default and yield a solid return. Fitch bases the ratings on several factors, such as what kind of debt a company holds and its sensitivity to systemic changes like interest rates.\n\nUnderstanding Fitch Ratings\n\nFitch is one of the top three credit rating agencies in the world. The Fitch rating system is very similar to other rating agencies in that they all use a letter system.\n\nThe Fitch rating system breaks entities into two categories, investment grade, and non-investment grade. The investment grade ratings are:\n\nAAA: companies of exceptionally high quality (established, with consistent cash flows)\n\nAA: still high quality; still has a low default risk.\n\nA: low default risk; slightly more vulnerable to business or economic factors\n\nBBB: a low expectation of default; business or economic factors could adversely affect the company\n\nThe non-investment grade ratings are:\n\nBB: elevated vulnerability to default risk, more susceptible to adverse shifts in business or economic conditions; still financially flexible\n\nB: degrading financial situation; highly speculative\n\nCCC: a real possibility of default\n\nCC: default is a strong probability\n\nC: default or default-like process has begun\n\nRD: issuer has defaulted on a payment\n\nD: defaulted\n\nFitch Ratings and Sovereign Nations\n\nFitch offers sovereign credit ratings that describe each nation’s ability to meet its debt obligations. Sovereign credit ratings are available to investors to help give them insight into the level of risk associated with investing in a particular country. Countries will invite Fitch and other credit rating agencies to evaluate their economic and political environments and financial situations to determine a representative rating. It’s essential for countries to obtain the best sovereign credit rating possible, particularly in the case of developing nations, as it aids in accessing funding in international bond markets.\n\nIn 2018 Fitch awarded the United States the highest AAA long-term sovereign credit rating. On the lower end was Brazil with a BB-. However, in 2023, Fitch downgraded the U.S. to AA+, a rating between AAA and AA that signifies a slight reduction in confidence that the country can pay its debts—but the agency believes the U.S. is still a high quality investment with a low risk of defaulting.\n\nFitch Ratings of Companies and Others\n\nFitch Ratings also analyzes the issues of companies, local governments and agencies, and financial institutions for their creditworthiness. For example, the agency analyzed two of Jacksonville, Florida's special revenue bonds, awarding them an AA- investment grade rating. This means the municipality is rated between a low risk of default and a low expectation of default on its two issuances, which total more than $290 million. The bonds are intended to refund earlier bond issues and finance capital equipment and improvements in the city.\n\nAt the financial institution level, Fitch rated London-based National Westminster Bank mortgage-covered bonds at AAA, with a stable outlook. This rating is the highest available, signifying Fitch's confidence in the bank's bonds.\n\nThe Bottom Line"
