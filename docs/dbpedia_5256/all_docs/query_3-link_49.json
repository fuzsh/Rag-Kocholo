Requires a redstone signal to be activated. Supports three upgrade types; Width Modifier increases width of push area by 1 block; Height Modifier increases height of push area by 1 block; Distance Modifier increases the distances mobs are pushed by 1 block\n\nIron Spikes: damages players and mobs which touch it. Mobs killed by the Iron Spikes drop experience, but they do not count as player kills\n\nMob Masher: an upgradeable mob grinding machine. Requires a redstone signal to be activated. Any living thing that touches it while it is active will continuously take damage. Anything killed by the Mob Masher counts as a player kill and drops experience. There are 6 upgrade types; Sharpness increases damage done per hit; Looting increases the quality of drops; Fire Aspect increases the fire damage and duration; Smite increases the damage done to undead mobs; Bane of Arthropods increases the damage done to arthropods; Beheading increases the chance of a slain mob dropping its head by 10% per upgrade\n\nAbsorption Hopper: automatically picks up experience and items from a target area. You can see the area by pressing “Show Area” in the Absorption Hopper GUI. You can also move this area around using the offset buttons. All six of the sides of the Absorption Hopper can be configured to give various types of output by clicking on the Down, Up, North, South, West, and East buttons. The Absorption Hopper can also be given up to 6 Radius Upgrades which increases the size of the area in which the Absorption Hopper picks up items and experience.\n\nEntity Conveyor: pushes any entity which is on top of it in a direction. The player can avoid being pushed by sneaking (holding shift)\n\nEnder Inhibitor: prevents entities from teleporting within 8 blocks of the Ender Inhibitor\n\nWither Boss Death Muffler: stops wither boss death sounds within an 8 blocks radius. Right clicking on the muffler also hides the Boss Bar\n\nEnder Dragon Death Muffler: stops the Ender Dragon Death sounds within a 32 block radius.
