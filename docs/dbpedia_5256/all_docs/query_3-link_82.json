        "text": "Treatments and interventions\n\nPeople treated with appropriate antibiotics in the early stages of Lyme disease usually recover rapidly and completely. The antibiotics most commonly used to treat Lyme disease include doxycycline, amoxicillin, or cefuroxime axetil. Early diagnosis and proper antibiotic treatment of Lyme disease can help prevent more severe disease.\n\nThe antibiotic used and the length of treatment depends on many factors, including:\n\nPatient symptoms\n\nAge\n\nAllergies\n\nPregnancy\n\nPost-exposure antibiotics\n\nIn general, CDC does not recommend antibiotics after tick bites to prevent tickborne diseases. However, in certain circumstances, a single dose of doxycycline after a tick bite in an area where Lyme disease is common may lower risk of Lyme disease. Ask your healthcare provider if antibiotics after a tick bite are appropriate for you."
