Proof can be found here.\n\nLong Page\n\nThis article currently has 20,097 bytes and may take a long time to load. Please proceed with caution and wait for it to load patiently.\n\nListen to this article!\n\nCineBlox Productions (known as simply CineBlox), is an animation production studio, which also serves as main cinema chain in the United States. CineBlox houses offices and their two headquarters in Brookhaven and CineBlox City, respectively and CineBlox Studios Theme Park in the neighborhood of Bloxywood in Bloxburg.\n\nBlox Home Entertainment Systems and Cinemas, formed in June 1976, began with distributing direct-to-video pictures for home media releases before expanding to release films for cinemas; they also co-developed the television series RSCP. However, the company's quality began to deteriorate and nearly went bankrupt as a result of a major change in leadership and a lack of funds. In 2000, the company rebranded as Cineblox Holdings Incorporated and began to form a cinema chain, eventually becoming the most successful cinema chain in the United States by the 2010s, surpassing X Cinema. Loui officially formed the studio on August 9, 2019, and began producing feature films for their cinema clain. Since then, they have created more than 42 feature films and short films. First beginning with the short film Noob Astronaut (2019), their first feature film, Pumpking was released later in the year. Their most recent release, Half-Blox, was first released in theaters on May 16, 2024. Their upcoming state of films include Game Over, which is slated to be released in the fall of 2024, and Pandora's Box, which has an uncertain release date.\n\nSince its major rebrand in 2019, CineBlox has collaborated with over eight production studios to produce films, including FoxScreen Production, Studio D313, Gorge Entertainment, SP Studios, Nova Studios, and Daring Industries, one of the most critically and commercially successful production studios. Several television series were also produced, such as Obby Lord and Joey & Chloe, and a streaming service, titled OddoTV. Depending on which movies are in theaters, the movie theater can restrict Robloxians above a certain age at any time. Currently, the movie theater is not restricted, but the movie theater warns that there might be unrealistic light blood on the movies.\n\nHistory[]\n\n2000–2019: as CineBlox Holdings, Inc[]\n\nCineBlox's former name was CineBlox Holdings, Inc., and started operating small with over 20 theaters. CineBlox had grown to over 100 theaters in Robloxia after its founding. Their headquarters were in the City of Robloxia, before it rebranded.\n\n2019–present: Rebrand as CineBlox Productions, start of producing features and major success[]\n\nOn August 9, 2019, Cineblox Holdings, Inc. had a whole rebranding, in which, they changed their name to just Cineblox Productions, and they moved their headquarters further down to Brookhaven. Cineblox expanded again with 100+ more theaters in the United States. Cineblox Productions began production on their debut short film and feature film in the same month as the rebranding.\n\nLater in the year, the studio officially released their debut work, Noob Astronaut, which received favorable reviews. Following Noob Astronaut, on December 25, 2019, Cineblox Production announced their first superhero feature, Blaze, co-produced with the newly founded production company Daring Industries, which would be released in cinemas in January 2020.[1] The film was a tremendous commercial and critical success.\n\nTheir second major film, Bolt, was announced in April 2020 and directed by oddgotbanned[2]; it was released the following month in May to great reviews. Originally set for a theatrical release, due to the on-going COVID-19 epidemic, the film was instead distributed on streaming sites, making it the ninth-most watched film of the week. On August 9, 2020, a year after the branding, one of the most popular theaters had a substantial remodeling known as \"V2.\"\n\nFollowing the release of several films from other studios that were co-producing with Cine, on May 24, 2020, just days after the release of Bolt, the studio announced Riding Hood, a horror film directed by samfox_4; the film was officially released in theaters in October 2020, and despite positive reviews, it was a box-office flop. In July 2020, the company announced Blaze 2, which was released on October 17, 2020, the same month as Riding Hood.[3] A concert was held on the same day as the film's premiere.[4] The picture was a tremendous success. The film's timing was one of the key reasons that contributed to Riding Hood becoming a box office disappointment, due to how Blaze was popular.\n\nThe studio released Crazy Vacation, directed by samfox_4, in September 2020, and the picture received great critical reviews.[5] The picture grossed more than $200 million at the box office, making it a triumph.\n\nTwo further films, Pumpking 2 and Christmas Chaos, were released on November 28 and December 19, 2020, respectively. Both films were critical and commercial successes, ranking as the eighth and ninth highest-grossing pictures of the year. Cineblox Productions also added a new premium cinema experience, called CBX, in part of their another rebrand. It is a one-of-a-kind premium-movie experience, with it having a very large screen with the BMAX movie format, a lot of seats, LED lighting all over the theater, and many premium-front row seats. It was added in all theaters.\n\nAs of June 10th, 2023, the theater is liked by 692 Robloxians, disliked by 105 Robloxians, favourited by 2,098 Robloxians, and the total visitor count is 244,052 Robloxians. Theaters are airing a lot of movies, and the theaters varies for seat occupancy depending on the theatre. The maximum occupancy of the theaters as a whole is 700.\n\nTheaters are where Robloxians can explore many of the cinema franchise's incredible movie creations, buy a ticket, eat popcorn, watch a movie, hang with friends, and do so much more. Unfortunately, theaters have no plans for private showings.\n\nOn December 15, 2021, permits were introduced to the theaters for the first time. Three permits exist:\n\nFront Row Seats: This allows Robloxians to purchase premium front row seat tickets for an extra 40 ROBUX.\n\nSpeed Boost: This allows Robloxians to run on the theater for an extra 40 ROBUX.\n\nAll Theater Access: This allows Robloxians to visit any theater at almost any time for 60 ROBUX.\n\nAs of July 2023, these permits listed above are not for sale anymore at CineBlox, and new ones have been introduced. The CineBlox Productions company have also made the CineBlox app on phones so that one can book seats for movies early for an extra 7 ROBUX. This extra fee is independent on the type of theatre one wants the movie to be in. The app was introduced around the same time that CineBlox had rebranded their theatres.\n\nCineBlox have rebranded their theatres and started a heavy construction project in the theaters in 2023 due to unknown reasons. The heavy construction project, once completed, will add two new premium types of theatres, CBX and 4DX-CBX. There will also be more theatre screens. These changes were announced by the CEO in April 2023.\n\nOn August 25, 2023, the Robloxian federal government closed the main theaters due to unknown reasons. The theater was placed under investigation by the Robloxian federal government until October 11, 2023. The theater reopened.\n\nTheaters[]\n\nAll theaters are owned by CineBlox and are the same as the theater in Brookhaven. Right before entering is the Blox Office for movie tickets, and there are screens showing what movies are airing. It has self-ticket machines. When entering the doors, Robloxians are greeted with the concession area and the entrance to the CBX premium theatre. The arcade is located in another building right next to the theatre. Across from the Concession, there is a hallway that will lead to the auditoriums. Staff will do a ticket scanning procedure before entering the auditoriums section, and before heading to the movie. After a scan is completed, the Robloxian enters the Auditoriums section.\n\nThere are 7 auditoriums on each side and are numbered as odd and even. It includes screens 1-15. Screens 6, 5, 10 and 9 (the main CBX theatre) are CBX theatres which include BMAX, premium seating and a big screen, and are really big theatres, has LED lighting all over the theatre, and has Dolby Vision. Screens 7-8 are 4DX-CBX theatres, which uses the Roblox ScreenX format (fictional but is actually real) and 4D effects with special 4DX seating in a 4-4-4 configuration on 3 levels. Screens 1, 2, 3, 4, 11, 12, 13, 14 and 15 are all regular movie auditoriums, with a medium screen and big seating. In late July 2023, a theater extension was added, with 6 new screens, one of them being a CBX theater.\n\nList of released and upcoming movies[]\n\nList of all movies in CineBlox Cinemas (As of 8/15/24) Movie Producer Premiere Date Notes The Storm l1u2i3 (Loui)\n\nNoob Astronaut (4D)\n\nl1u2i3 (Loui) This animated short movie is CineBlox's first animated film.
