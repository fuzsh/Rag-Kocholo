Jackson to William B. Lewis, February 7, 1825, Correspondence of Jackson, ed. Bassett, 3:276.\n\n8. Clay perhaps detested Jackson more, the enmity stretching back to Clay’s leading the House fight to have Jackson censured for his unauthorized attack on Spanish posts in Florida in 1818. See David S. Heidler and Jeanne T. Heidler, Old Hickory’s War: Andrew Jackson and the Quest for Empire (Mechanicsburg, Pa.: Stackpole Books, 1996; reprint, Baton Rouge: Louisiana State University Press, 2003), 214–18. Further, Clay had no real knowledge of where Jackson stood on such important national issues as the Bank of the United States, internal improvements, and a protective tariff, all of which were crucial in Clay’s view to the proper development of the country.

Crawford had been chosen by the Republican caucus in 1824, a mark of distinction in previous elections but a harmful designation in the new political climate of participatory democracy.\n\n13.

When Jackson and Rachel Donelson Robards married, they assumed that her abusive first husband had obtained a divorce, only to learn several years later that this was not the case. When Lewis Robards finally received his divorce, by then on the grounds of bigamy and adultery, the Jacksons quietly married again. These events had occurred more than 30 years earlier on a frontier with more relaxed attitudes toward such matters. The attacks on Rachel Jackson, a pious, elderly matron of impeccable character, seemed beyond the bounds of decency to many people, especially to her husband who had killed to protect her virtue.\n\n22.
