        "text": "For an exp farm your mobs will have to fall 24 blocks to be killable on one hit. That way you get the xp and the special drops.\n\nFor mobs to spawn very efficiently you want to be 128 blocks away from any other potential spawning points for them (blocks with block light lower than 8), so you should be 128 blocks above the highest block in an 128 x 128 area around your spawner.\n\nI think the best would be around 24 blocks for the floor. This way you can one hit them and get the exp. you can also add more levels on top of that."
