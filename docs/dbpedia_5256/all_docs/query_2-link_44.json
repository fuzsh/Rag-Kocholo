        "text": "Netflix announced on Sunday that it will begin streaming the anime film of Shinichi Ishizuka's Blue Giant manga in the United States and Canada on September 1.\n\nSeven Seas Entertainment is publishing Ishizuka's 10-volume Blue Giant manga series as five omnibus volumes, and it describes the story:\n\nMiyamoto Dai, a student with a taste for basketball, changes his life the first time he sees a live jazz performance. The incredible music strikes a chord deep inside him, and he immediately decides to dedicate himself to the saxophone. He has no skills, no formal training, and no idea what he's up against, but his obsession drives him to play that instrument day after day. Will passion be enough to become the player of his dreams? This award-winning manga from Shinichi Ishizuka, compiled into five omnibus volumes for its English debut, is a pitch-perfect drama about the power of music.\n\nThe film opened in Japan in February 2023, and it earned 116,561,020 yen (about US$867,600) in its first three days. The film has earned over 1 billion yen as of April 2023. The film had a sneak preview screening at the 2023 Annecy International Animation Film Festival in June 2023.\n\nGKIDS screened the film in theaters in North America in October 2023. The company also released the film on Blu-ray Disc and \"all major digital platforms\" on April 30.\n\nYuzuru Tachikawa (Death Parade, all three seasons of Mob Psycho 100, Deca-Dence) directed the film at studio NUT. NUMBER 8, the editor of the Blue Giant manga and the story director for the Blue Giant Supreme manga, wrote the screenplay. TOHO animation is distributing the film.\n\nWorld-renowned pianist Uehara composed the original music that the film's in-story jazz trio JASS performs, and also played the piano for the character Yukinori Sawabe. Saxophonist Tomoaki Baba played the saxophone for the character Dai. Shun Ishiwaka, the drummer of the Millennium Parade band, played drums for Shunji Tamada.\n\nIshizuka (Gaku - Minna no Yama) launched the manga in Big Comic in May 2013, and ended it in August 2016. The manga was nominated for the eighth Manga Taisho Awards in 2015, as well as the ninth awards in 2016. The manga won the Grand Prize in the Manga Division of the 20th Japan Media Arts Festival Awards in 2017.\n\nIshizuka then launched Blue Giant Supreme sequel manga in Big Comic in September 2016, and ended it in April 2020. The manga had 10 volumes.\n\nIshizuka launched a new sequel manga titled Blue Giant Explorer in Big Comic in May 2020.\n\nThe Blue Giant manga series has a cumulative total of 10 million copies in circulation."
