        "text": "For our latest Weekend Watch Party, we revisited the broiling Brooklyn of Spike Lee’s “Do the Right Thing,” a film whose unflinching, complex depiction of racial tension has not dated much in 31 years. What has changed is that the movie, enormously controversial when it was released in 1989, has been embraced as a classic.\n\nIt’s part of the curriculum now: we received comments from high school students who watched it for class as well as remarks from some teachers. The students had a lot to say about Lee’s painful themes and arguments, which, among other things, dynamically put Martin Luther King Jr. and Malcolm X into play.\n\nUnlike too many contemporary (OK, white) critics who focused on their own racial fears, the students also appreciated Lee’s art. Badly made films seldom make history, and one reason that “Do the Right Thing” remains resonant is that it is still, as Vincent Canby said in his New York Times review, “one terrific movie.”\n\nI’ve come to the conclusion that Lee believes that the “right thing” is actually less important than the action of “doing the right thing,” which X and King themselves both embraced through constant direct action against racism. — Kalyan N, Sunnyvale, CA (senior at the Harker School in San Jose, Calif.)\n\nA.O. SCOTT I saw “Do the Right Thing” for the first time in Baltimore, the week it opened. Of course, I remember what we’re now in the habit of calling “the discourse” — the critics and commentators warning that it would provoke riots; the TV news panels about the State of Race in America; Spike Lee’s disinclination to play nice in the media — but mostly I remember the excitement of feeling that I was watching one of the great films of my lifetime.\n\nAfter this last viewing — I lost count a long time ago — I still feel that way. But what I also felt, maybe for the first time, was something like nostalgia. Bill Nunn and Danny Aiello, who played Radio Raheem and Sal, are both gone, following Ossie Davis, Ruby Dee and Robin Harris. Looking at some of the other faces, I marvel at how young they look, and also at Lee’s often underrated skill as a director of actors. There is so much life and personality here, a truthfulness that bursts out of the narrow conventions of realism and turns into something else.\n\nBut I have to be honest: through most of this viewing what I was thinking about most was pizza. I miss pizza so much.\n\nAs part of a series of tough conversations on difficult issues, my congregation selected this film as a jumping off point to discuss racism and our roles in continuing it. It was probably the most enlightening conversation we ever had. Although we have always viewed ourselves to be progressive, liberal, white do-gooders; those images of ourselves were exposed for what they were … skin deep (pun intended). — Julie, Portland\n\nMANOHLA DARGIS A few things jump out at me now, including how heavily history presses down hard on the film via Martin and Malcolm but also Dee and Davis. Their offscreen roles as artist-activists set an exemplary model for a conscious, conscientious life, yet that history makes a biting, poignant contrast with their roles here. Davis plays Da Mayor, a shambling souse who’s by turns tolerated, mocked and valued by younger people, while Dee’s Mother Sister mostly watches the world pass by.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
