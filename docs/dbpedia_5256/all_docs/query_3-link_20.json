        "text": "This is an FRC of the type that you see on ERRVs and SOME OSVs:\n\nThis is a MOB-boat that you find on most ships, except those fitted with Lifeboats that is approved as MOB-boats.\n\nRidget type:\n\nInflatable type:\n\nThe “Economy size” MOB-boat:\n\nALL are SOLAS approved and require regular maintenance per SOLAS.\n\nI don’t believe this is quite correct. AFAIK cargo ships are not required to carry MOB boats. They have two enclosed lifeboats and one is designated as the rescue boat.\n\nPerhaps the ships with free-fall boats are required to have an extra boat.\n\nDo the regs mention MOB boats?\n\nThis boat looks like it would be suitable for recovering a MOB\n\nThis is what a “designated rescue boat” looks like:\n\nIt’s a lifeboat - that’s been “designated” as a rescue boat.\n\nYou can tell it’s a designated rescue boat because it has the word “RESCUE” painted on it.\n\nThat is what I have been saying all along.\n\nA Rescue boats (MOB-boat) is NOT a FAST RESCUE CRAFT (FRC) but a FRC CAN be used as Rescue boat (MOB-boat)\n\nhttps://www.wartsila.com/encyclopedia/term/rescue-boat-man-over-board-(mob)-boat\n\nFRCs are used on ERRVs and OSV used as Standby boats to rescue survivors from platforms, rigs and FPSOs etc. in an emergency.\n\nThey are also used to transport personnel to/from SOVs used on wind farms:\n\nTo operate FRCs require personnel trained and certified per STCW:\n\nPS> Davit launched lifeboats MAY be dedicated as Rescue/MOB-boat subject to complying with SOLAS rules foe Rescue Crafts.\n\nFree fall lifeboat cannot be so dedicated.\n\nI think we can agree (you, me and Wartsila) that enclosed lifeboat are not very suitable as MOB-boat. (Post # 7)\n\nThat the visibility from the manoeuvre position is limited is quite obvious.\n\nThe limited maneuverability is also well known.\n\nThe small hatches on either side and the relatively high freeboard (when not fully loaded with people) is not very conducive to the ease of pulling people from the water.\n\nHow they can be approved as “Designated Rescue Crafts” is a good question.\n\nSOLAS III, Reg 31 - Survival Craft and Rescue boats**\n\n31.2 - Rescue Boats\n\nCargo ships shall carry at least one rescue boat complying with the requirements of section 5.1 of the Code. A lifeboat may be accepted as a rescue boat, provided that it and its launching and recovery arrangements also comply with the requirements for a rescue boat.\n\n“MOB” Boats is not a SOLAS term and not an international term. Frankly, I have never heard it ever other than on gCaptain. Never at sea and never on shore.\n\nI have not been able to find where an FRC is required by regulation over a rescue boat, any guidance from this crew on that would be appreciated I am always looking for opportunities to be smarter.\n\nAccording to the LSA Code, the only difference between an FRC and a Rescue Boat is capabilities such as size, speed, maneuverability, etc.\n\nAside from on RO/Pax ships they are not required on ordinary Merchant ships\n\n.\n\nAs said several times in this and the original thread; they are uses on ERRVs and some OSVs, as well as on SOVs. That is by nature of their tasks, not as a SOLAS requirement, but they would usually then double as Rescue/MOB-boat to meet that SOLAS requirement.\n\nMOB-boat is a commonly used term all over the world. (But frequently confused with FRC),\n\nMaybe not by American seafarers, sailing on US flag ship.(??)"
