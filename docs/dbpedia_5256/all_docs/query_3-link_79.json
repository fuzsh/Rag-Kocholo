        "text": "Sprint Speed Leaderboard\n\nCurrent: Sprint Speed\n\n▾\n\nSprint Speed is Statcast’s foot speed metric, defined as “feet per second in a player’s fastest one-second window” on individual plays. For a player’s seasonal average, the following two types of plays currently qualify for inclusion in Sprint Speed. The best of these runs, approximately two-thirds, are averaged for a player’s seasonal average.\n\n* Runs of two bases or more on non-homers, excluding being a runner on second base when an extra base hit happens\n\n* Home to first on “topped” or “weakly hit” balls.\n\nThe Major League average on a \"competitive\" play is 27 ft/sec, and the competitive range is roughly from 23 ft/sec (poor) to 30 ft/sec (elite). A Bolt is any run above 30ft/sec. A player must have at least 10 competitive runs to qualify for this leaderboard.
