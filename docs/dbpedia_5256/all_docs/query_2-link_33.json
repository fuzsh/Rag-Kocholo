        "text": "They may be great, but some still had us checking our watches and rushing to the washroom before the sweet bliss of their end credits. For this list of the longest Hollywood movies ever made, I have narrowed my picks to only mainstream Hollywood movies that must have been over 200 minutes long when shown originally in theaters. We’re also excluding experimental films, director’s cuts and extended versions.\n\nThis epic drama may’ve received mixed reviews, but with a budget that big and 4 Academy Award wins, it’s hard to ignore “Cleopatra.” Elizabeth Taylor, Richard Burton and Rex Harrison’s performances have been singled out, but then there’s its running time of 4 hours and 8 minutes! It was 1963’s highest grossing film and, despite some inaccuracies, it is considered a fairly close look at Ancient Egypt during the time of the last active pharaoh – so we guess the length was necessary.\n\nDon’t mess with director Kenneth Branagh, especially when it has to do with Shakespeare. Of all the Bard adaptations he’s done in his career, none has surpassed this 4 hour and 2 minute drama. Directed by Branagh and starring him in title role, this feat of a movie includes every single scene from Shakespeare’s original version! Talk about dedication. Despite being set in the 19th century, “Hamlet” is well known as one of the most faithful Shakespeare adaptations in history.\n\nWhen this epic historical drama was first released in theaters, it was screened with an overture, intermission, musical pause, and exit music, giving it a running time of between 234-238 minutes; but the film’s actual length is closer to 221 minutes. Regardless of the exact number, “Gone with the Wind” won 10 Oscars and earned much critical praise. Perhaps the secret to its success can be found in the central quartet of characters: headstrong Scarlett O'Hara; charming Rhett Butler; and the less colorful but equally complex Ashley Wilkes and Melanie Hamilton, who complete a tangled romantic foursome thrown together and cast apart by chance, destiny, and the fortunes of war.\n\nOver 40 years have passed and this Oscar winner still sets the standard for greatness in the epic adventure genre. And what an epic it is! At 3 hours and 42 minutes, “Lawrence of Arabia” keeps us captivated the whole way through thanks to a phenomenal cast, an insightful script, breathtaking cinematography and masterful direction by David Lean. Meanwhile, Peter O'Toole's legendary performance as Lawrence will undoubtedly live forever.\n\nIf you’re looking for a religious epic that won’t disappoint, then “The Ten Commandments” is a safe bet. Adapting the biblical story of Moses onto film, the Cecil B. DeMille production is 3 hours and 40 minutes of pure entertainment with versatile performances. Extravagant, excessive, and bold, the Oscar-winning film was also one of the highest-grossing flicks of the 1950s and DeMille’s last work before his death.\n\n“Ben-Hur” dominated the Oscars following its 1959 release. In the epic historical drama, Charlton Heston stars as a rich Jewish prince during the time of Jesus who is turned into a slave by the Romans. Years pass and then, Ben-Hur is after his former childhood friend who turned against him. The William Wyler-directed film is also known for the scene showcasing a 9-minute long chariot race, as well as its lengthy but fitting score, all of which serves to fill this epically long film with so much excitement it seems much shorter than its 212 minutes.\n\n“The Irishman” is …an incredibly Dostoyevskian statement from Scorsese. Its 209 minutes, for the most part, fly by. There’s an unfortunate shapelessness to the first 20 or so minutes which introduces us to a very young and, off-puttingly, de-aged De Niro and how he managed to go from meat-packing driver to finally get into the mob business as a hitman. At that point, the drama starts to elevate, the de-aging a little less of a distraction and we are thrust into a 1960s America filled with crime, both societal and political. It doesn’t let up for the next three hours, with only a few (very short) dull stretches here and there, as a whirlwind of characters and plot twists are thrown at us at fervorous speed. “The Irishman” could have surely benefitted from being, actually, a little longer.\n\nThe conclusion to Peter Jackson’s “Lord of the Rings” trilogy is epic fantasy at its absolute best – at least that’s what an overwhelming amount of critics and moviegoers seem to think. After all, “The Return of the King” earned 11 Oscar statues and $1 billion in box office receipts around the world. Following hobbits Frodo and Sam with the One Ring, as well as Gandalf, Aragorn and more as they battle Sauron, the film is 201 minutes of incredible effects, emotional storytelling and so much more.\n\nWith a running time of 201 minutes, “Giant” earned its director an Academy Award, but James Dean didn’t even live to see the final product: a car crash took his life when he was just 24. Following the tale of a Texas ranching family, the drama is a multifaceted and visually stunning one that tackles social, political and racial issues with depth. Today, it remains a classic of American cinema and further cemented Dean’s status a cultural icon.\n\nPut a screenplay co-written by Spike Lee based on the life of Malcolm X together with an Oscar-nominated performance by Denzel Washington and what do you get? An incredibly poignant biographical drama, also directed by Lee, which brings to life the most crucial moments in the African-American activist’s time on Earth. Well-received by critics and finishing third at the box office during its opening weekend, “Malcolm X” definitely had people riveted for all of its 3+ hours.\n\nIt’s a gangster film, a crime epic and a masterpiece. Directed by Francis Ford Coppola and serving as both a prequel and a sequel to 1972,’s “The Godfather,” “Part 2” is a cinema classic revolving around Al Pacino-as-Michael Corleone and Robert De Niro’s Oscar-winning portrayal of Vito Corleone during two different time periods. Running for 3 hours and 20 minutes long, “The Godfather Part II” continues to be respected today and is often considered one of the finest achievements ever.\n\n[Original WatchMojo article was written by yours truly has been edited for current-day numbers]"
