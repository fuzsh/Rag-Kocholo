        "text": "Mob mentality, herd mentality, pack mentality, groupthink, or crowd psychology â the concept has many names. These all boil down to the same idea: Individuals are influenced by a larger group. Regardless of whether that group includes people in your class, your neighborhood, or an entire nation, you may experience mob mentality.\n\nIn the 1950s, researchers conducted a famous conformity experiment that showed how readily people conform or change their behavior to match social norms. It involved:\n\nA single participant was put in a room with seven undercover accomplices.\n\nAsch presented the group with four lines, and the goal was to determine which two lines were the same length.\n\nEven though the answer was obvious, the undercover accomplices purposefully gave an incorrect answer.\n\nThe real participant answered last.\n\nThe intent of the experiment was to see if the real participant would give a false answer â conforming with the accomplices â even if the correct answer was clear.\n\nâThe results were surprising. About one-third of the real participants answered incorrectly. They conformed to the wrong answer given by the rest of the group.\n\nWhy did they do it? When the participants heard the incorrect answer, some started to believe the incorrect answer was actually correct. The participants conformed mainly because they wanted to fit in with the rest of the group and thought the rest of the group was more informed than they were.\n\nDegrees of Mob Mentality\n\nThe Asch conformity experiments were artificially created scenarios that you probably wonât encounter in real life. However, you probably have regular chances to get caught up in mob mentality without realizing it.\n\nEveryday mob mentality. Conforming to the group is rarely conscious or dramatic. In your everyday life, consider how often you go to specific places, watch specific shows, or eat certain foods because your friends do. This process makes decision-making easier and keeps you from standing out in a group.\n\nCrowd behavior. Public groups and mobs are the most obvious examples of mob mentality. Whether gathering to grieve, protest, or cheer on a sports team, a crowd can quickly adopt a group mentality.\n\nOne of the dangers of mob mentalities is the type of influence it can have. According to research about mob mentality, a small population within the mob makes the informed decisions that other people conform to. The larger the group gets, the fewer informed members there are.\n\nThis situation can become dangerous. As a crowdâs perceptions and actions change and conform, an event can become violent. However, with organized leadership, a crowdâs beliefs can be informed and directed in a more appropriate way.\n\nCauses\n\nYou might get caught up in mob mentality for a few reasons. If disagreeing with the group poses a risk, you are more likely to stay silent. That risk can be small, like getting dirty looks, or large, like being punished.\n\nYou probably wonât conform to a group you have nothing in common with. There are several situations you may find yourself in that may make you more open to mob mentality.\n\nYour group is going through a stressful situation.\n\nGroup leadership is intimidating or overbearing.\n\nThe group has a tendency to agree on every decision.\n\nThere is no predetermined process for decision-making.\n\nThe group only interacts with itself.â"
