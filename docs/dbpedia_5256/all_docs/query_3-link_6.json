        "text": "There are three test modes on the MOB1; Functional, DSC and AIS/GPS.\n\nThe Functional test should be carried out once a month and will display the length of time the battery has been used for. It will also apply a load to the battery to test that the battery is not faulty or has been discharged. It carries out other functional tests on the electronic circuitry. It does not test the GPS or make test transmissions.\n\nThe DSC test should be carried out no more than two times a year. This test sends a single DSC transmission to the MMSI programmed into the MOB1, which will be displayed on the vessels DSC radio. It does not send a Distress or Distres Relay call and the call does not contain the position.\n\nThe AIS test should be carried out no more than three times a year. This test activates the GPS receiver and after the position is determined it makes an AIS transmission, which will display on a suitable AIS receiver or chartplotter. The received AIS message will show the position determined by the MOB1 GPS receiver. There is also a transmission of the AIS text message containing the words “MOB TEST”. Note that this test must be done with the MOB1 in full view of the sky. Without a valid position, the MOB1 will not transmit any AIS messages.\n\nThe limitation on the number of tests a year is to ensure that the battery will still have its full operational life at the expiry date of the battery.\n\nIf the unit fails to programme, showing the flashing red LED on completion, please try again. Turn the MOB1 on in programming mode again and retry. There is no need to exit the programming screen on the programme. If the programming page is showing, simply press F10 again to commence the programming sequence again. Note that the red flashing may tecke several seconds to start after the on screen sequence has finished.\n\nIf you are having problems programming your MOB1, please check the following guidance.\n\n1) Make sure that your screen brightness is set to maximum, using the controls on the monitor or device.\n\n2) Ensure that you have commenced programming within 50 seconds of putting the MOB1 into programming mode. Failure to do this will cause the MOB1 to have turned off before communication starts. Note that once programming has commenced (The white box is flashing) the MOB1 should stay on until the programming sequence is completed. Ideally the MOB1 should be put into programming mode just before placing the MOB1 in front of the white square.\n\n3) Ensure that the MOB1 is placed over the white square with the rubber programming adaptor firmly touching the screen and with the aperture in the rubber close to the centre of the white box.\n\n4) Avoid programming the MOB1 in bright ambient light conditions. If necessary point the screen away from direct or bright sources of light such as sun through a window. (In extreme circumstances, especially with older screens that have lost their brightness, place a thick cloth over the screen and MOB1 to block out the ambient light.)\n\n5) The MOB1 configuration software requires precise timing, which may be disrupted by other applications running at the same time, especially on slower computers. If you still encounter problems, try shutting down all un-necessary applications, including anti-virus software.\n\n6) On laptops, the F10 key will require using in conjunction with the Function (labelled Func or Fn) to start the white box flashing black and white to send the data to the MOB1. Most keyboards will colour the F keys in the same colour as the Function key to identify this.\n\n7) The MOB1 MMSI programming software is only available for Windows PCs. For users of other operating systems and smart phones and tablets there is an online application available.\n\nAll AIS and DSC MOBs are pre programmed at the time of manufacture with the self identification MMSI number. In the case of the rescueME MOB1, or the M100, this number will always start 97260—-. The 972 identities the device as an MOB device and the 60 identifies the device as manufactured by Ocean Signal.\n\nIt is not possible for the user to change this number, which is a requirement of the relevant approval standards.\n\nThe DSC MMSI number programmed in by the user is the number the MOB1 will send the distress calls to. Compatible radios will still show the ‘from’ MMSI number as the 972 number printed on the rear of the MOB1. Likewise the target displayed on an AIS plotter will also show with the target address as the 972 number."
