        "text": "For other uses of \"Eobard Thawne\", see Eobard Thawne (disambiguation).\n\nProfessor Eobard Thawne (c. 2151[1] - 2022),[2] also known as the Reverse-Flash and nicknamed the Mysterious Yellow Flash by onlookers[3] was a meta-human speedster from the twenty-second century, a descendant of the late Eddie Thawne, a time criminal and the archenemy of Barry Allen/The Flash. A massive fan obsessed with the twenty-first century's Flash all his life, Eobard recreated the accident that was behind the Flash's powers, becoming a speedster himself. Almost two centuries from the 21st century, Thawne met Flash and learned various ways to become faster than anything. However, when Thawne was about to make his grand entrance and be hailed as a hero, the Flash beat him to it and stole his greatest moment from him, therefore humiliating him. That coupled with his discovery that he was destined to become the Flash's greatest enemy, the Reverse-Flash, Thawne lost his mind and took his rage out on his idol out of envy of not being who he is and spite for humiliated him. Therefore, he decided to embrace his inescapable destiny and become the greatest arch-nemesis he ever had, prove his superiority as Reverse-Flash and becoming the opposite of his former idol and defeat him. This included creating his own negative version of the Speed Force using negative energy and exercising his raw emotions, which he used to travel through time without the Flash I being able to detect him. Since then, the two speedsters battled each other for many years, but neither of them was strong or fast enough to defeat the other.\n\nAfter learning the Flash's secret identity, Eobard traveled back in time to kill Barry as a child to erase his foe from existence but was thwarted by the Flash of 2024 who brought the younger Barry to safety. The enraged Eobard then killed Nora Allen and framed Henry Allen for the crime instead, being known as the Man in Yellow after the incident. However, Eobard's connection to the Speed Force began fluctuating, trapping him in the early twenty-first century. Realizing that Barry was the only way to return to his time, Eobard killed a man in order to assume the identity of Harrison Wells as the director of S.T.A.R. Labs, and to push through for the creation of a particle accelerator to ensure that Barry would become the Flash. Posing as Wells, Eobard mentored the Flash and became the leader of a team that he assembled to stop the meta-human threats, to increase his protégé's speed so that Eobard could use the hero's connection to the Speed Force to return to his own time. During this time, he also developed a bond with Cisco Ramon as another protégé. After his plan was exposed and subsequently foiled, Eobard was erased from existence after his ancestor Eddie killed himself to stop him.\n\nOne year after Eobard was erased from existence, Barry prevented Eobard from murdering Nora, creating the Flashpoint timeline and holding him captive for months. After realizing this mistake, Barry released Eobard, allowing him to kill Nora again; as a result of being pulled out of the timeline Eobard was spared from his fate and continued to exist as a time remnant, while his original actions remained intact. Due to his own nullified state of existence; he was hunted by the Black Flash, forcing him to seek out the Spear of Destiny in order to restore his natural existence. Unable to find the object and outrun the enforcer at the same time, Eobard formed a supervillain alliance. Eobard and his co-conspirators eventually retrieved the Spear of Destiny, which they used to rewrite reality to their whims. Despite its initial success, Eobard's plan was foiled by the Legends' de-powering the object, and Eobard was vaporized by the Black Flash.\n\nLater, Eobard mysteriously resurfaced as an ally of the New Reich of Earth-X. He originally tried to carry out the Fuhrer's request to perform heart surgery on Overgirl. However, when the Reich's defeat eventually became inevitable, he abandoned his allies to their deaths at the hands of Team Flash, Team Arrow, the Legends, and Supergirl.\n\nIn 2034, Eobard was incarcerated in the meta-human wing of Iron Heights, where his powers were negated by Cicada's dagger. In 2049, he began mentoring Nora West-Allen, claiming to be working towards a less villainous legacy, as he was scheduled for execution. However, the real reason why he mentored Nora in traveling to the past was to destroy the dagger and free him. After the dagger was destroyed, Eobard was freed, moments before his execution. He briefly fought Nora and Barry before Nora began to be erased from existence. After the two ran away to enter the Negative Speed Force at Eobard's fervent suggestion, Eobard made his escape.\n\nFollowing the Anti-Monitor Crisis and the creation of the new multiverse, Eobard's spirit joined the other versions of Wells of the old multiverse in being fused to the brainwaves of Harrison Nash Wells. As Eobard's body was a copy of Earth-1 Wells, it gave him an easier access to possessing Nash. His specter was composed of negative particles and emotions, with a hatred for everyone as he wanted to brutally kill Barry and Team Flash. However, Nash was freed as Eobard's consciousness was expelled from Nash's body as negative tachyons. Months later, the Speed Force reconstituted Eobard to help against August Heart who he defeated. After seeing Barry's speed was too great for him, Eobard retreated to fight for another day.\n\nEobard later created and became the host of the Negative Still Force, which allowed him to travel in time wherever he pleased and alter/manipulate time to his desires. This kickstarted Armageddon as part for his masterplan to defeat his arch-nemesis once-and-for all. He started by manipulating time to cause the death of Joe West and erasing Barry's memories of the event. Eobard then started manipulating time to drive Barry insane, such as framing him for being Black Hole's mole, which got Barry suspended from the CCPD.\n\nEobard's machinations caused his nemesis to supposedly go rogue and cause the destruction of the Earth in 2031, by Armageddon, which led to Despero to travel back in time to 2021 in an attempt to stop Barry. After escaping Despero, Barry traveled to 2031 to try to stop himself from destroying the Earth and much to his horror, he found out that Eobard used the Negative Still Force to become a successful businessman and get engaged to Iris West-Allen. However, with Damien Darhk's help, Barry ultimately prevented the alternate timeline that Eobard created from ever happening.\n\nAfter the timeline was changed back to normal, Eobard was being erased from existence by the timeline itself, even his connection to the Negative Speed Force was not able to prevent this from happening. As a result, Eobard asked Team Flash to help save his life. The group as a whole was initially reluctant to do so, but Barry ultimately saved Eobard's life by severing the latter's connection to the Negative Speed Force. Eobard was then sent to an A.R.G.U.S. prison.\n\nThe time displaced version of Eobard was made into the protector of a fixed point in time, having been brought back to life and stripped of his powers by the Time Wraiths after his death by the Black Flash. Placed in 1914 to ensure the assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand and, thus, the resulting world war, Eobard came to agree that the timeline could not and should not be changed. However, Eobard agreed to help the Legends attract the Waverider by changing the circumstances of Ferdinand's death. When the Legends' plan went awry, Eobard was killed by Sara Lance's robot clone and was ultimately replaced as the protector of the fixed point by Nate Heywood's robot clone. This version was later resurrected a second time by the Time Wraiths to give him a chance for redemption as he never gave up his post as the protector of the fixed point and eventually meet Meena Dhawan, helping her and falling in love with her. However, after the Negative Still Force killed the bad Eobard, the good Eobard was unwillingly sacrificed as part of a resurrection plan that the Negative Forces developed to bring the bad version back.\n\nAfter ripping through his good self and regaining his powers, Thawne vowed to destroy Barry for good this time; also taunting him about Iris was used for his rebirth. Traveling back to the Negative Speed Force, he absorbed the powers of the Negative Forces. However, Thawne would eventually be destroyed by his nemesis in battle, with his entire body being disintegrated by his own negative energies.\n\nBiography[]\n\nOriginal multiverse[]\n\nEarly life[]\n\nEobard Thawne was born in the year 2151[1] into the distant future, a modern time where technology has vastly advanced to the maximum extent but cows were unfortunately extinct.[1] When he was a child, he was taught astro-navigation in grade school,[4] and grew up as a diehard fan who passionately idolized the Flash, the 21st century superhero speedster whom inspired him all of his life to the point of being like the man for as long as he can remember.[5] A scion of the Thawne family consisting of notable generations of scientists, politicians, and industrialists, he is a well-respected member within his own beloved family and his first name \"Eobard\" is apparently distinguished.[6] Eobard is also very aware and knowledgeable of his ancestor Eddie Thawne despite history having virtually no record of Eddie's existence, however, Eobard doesn't hold Eddie in high regard as he himself scornfully considers his distant ancestor to be a failure of within their family by his standards due to having an uneventful life.[6]\n\nAmbitions to be a hero and save the world[]\n\nGrowing up, Eobard had altruistic dreams, desires, ambitions, and visions to achieve greatness, reach higher feats, advance science and improve the world of its greatest problems. Therefore he became a scientist and a physicist, eventually joining the academia as a student, researcher and professor and dedicated his life to learning, unlocking and discovering the Speed Force's secrets with the hopes to fulfill that wish.[4][7]\n\nBecoming a speedster[]\n\nHaving spent years trying to discover the Speed Force's secrets, Eobard became so fascinated and obsessed with the Flash to the point that between the 2170s or 2190s he learned of his lifelong idol's origins and how these super-powers were obtained. All years of research, investigation and studies eventually culminated in where he duplicated the transformation that was originally behind said powers of superhuman speed, thus Eobard became a meta-human speedster with the power of time travel via a connection to the Speed Force, and presumably created or obtained a suit with the opposite colors.[5] At some point, he also designed an anti-speedster rifle that is now in possession of the legends.[8][4]\n\nThe feud's start[]\n\nUsing his superpowers, Thawne somehow learned many ways to channel and his speeds, becoming faster than anything alive and also learned to use this to travel through time. Thawne then traveled to the future, approximately two centuries from the 21st century and finally met the Flash for the very first time. In his own words, he was about to present himself to the world and start his heroics, but the Flash intervened to save a random crowd from an unknown disaster, attracting the attention and praise that Thawne was meant to earn, stealing his greatest opportunity and shattering his most memorable moment and therefore putting his longtime diehard fan to shame in the process. In that very moment, Thawne grew resentful of the Flash because for all the praise he has admired his idol, he gets paid back with betrayal and indignation and vowed to become faster than the Flash to prove himself as the fastest man alive.[9]\n\nEobard presumably then navigated back to an unknown point in the 21st century and some time during his travel but unfortunately he discovered from his ability to travel through time that he was tragically doomed to become mortal enemies with the Flash and the reverse of everything that his idol was and stood for, instead of a successor and the hero he desperately strived to become.[5]\n\nDevastated to his very core by this realization, Thawne was left horrified, shocked, confused, and disillusioned. He could not believe the revelation himself after everything he wanted to do to save the world. To make matters even worse, Thawne was driven insane and lost his mind, which incited him to take his anger out on his former idol and cause a rampage against the man's life.[10] Thawne then became consumed with an insatiable and everlasting hatred for the Flash who he began to see as the villain from his point of view. In desperation, he adopted the supervillain moniker of the \"Reverse-Flash\" and fulfilled his inescapable destiny as his fallen idol's greatest archenemy while descending into madness on path to the abyss.[5][10]\n\nBecoming his opposite adversary[]\n\nIn both his obsession to be the Flash's exact opposite to surpass and defeat as well as to time travel undetected, Eobard obtained this with an energy that first tapped into him by feeding off of his hatred for his former idol therefore becoming the avatar of the the Negative Speed Force.[11] This also gave him the idea to exploit this energy source for his own uses and therefore he built a biometric lightning oscillation chamber to increase his connection to it and use it to its full potential, thinking that he created this energy all by himself with the actual case however being that it has always existed.[2] From this point forward, Eobard underwent massive changes in his personality, behavior and mental health due to his exposure to the negative tachyons that it made him more dangerous and unstable every time he abused it, to the point he rendered himself nearly invulnerable to timeline changes.[11][7] Out of revenge for being shamed and envy for being a foil, he vowed destroy the Flash's life, career, and dream, so much that for everyone saved Thawne would kill more. Thawne then made it his life's work to surpass the Flash as a speedster, to defeat by whatever means necessary (including killing loved ones and worthy successors), and usurp his nemesis.[5]\n\nPursuit of his former idol[]\n\nEobard is implied to have met Rip Hunter, the designer of the first Time Sphere, whom he considers an \"interesting man\", which could be how he also obtained possession of Gideon, an artificial intelligence program created by the Flash, and began searching various moments throughout history to learn when the Flash was active. He began traveling back in time to find when the Flash was active and after several searches proved fruitless, he eventually traveled back to the year of the Flash's origins, starting their war across time.[5]\n\nReverse-Flash arrived in January 2016, Central City.[12] After Gideon confirmed his whereabouts, he began searching for the Flash. Eobard rigged a truck to drive at high speeds and collide with a building to lure the Flash out, and was successful. Pleased to have located the exact time era the Flash was active, Eobard planned his return home to properly plan his next attack and broke into one of Mercury Labs' offsite facilities, and prepared equipment designed to act as a time machine to send him back to his own time. However, Eobard was unable to replicate the tachyon power source and sought out Dr. Tina McGee.\n\nStorming Mercury Labs and striking four guards, he confronted Tina but was interrupted by the Flash's arrival. However, Reverse-Flash was surprised when the Flash addressed him by his real name, revealing the Flash already met him at some point in the future and that the Flash had seen him die. However, Reverse-Flash simply thanked the Flash for telling him of his impending fate and told the Flash he now knew what time period the Flash was from and that his nemesis would soon die instead, and he knocked the Flash out before taking Tina to the offsite facility.\n\nWhen Eobard showed his device, Tina recalled a \"man in a yellow suit\" tried to steal another tachyon device the previous year. Upon hearing this, Eobard realized that he must have gotten stuck in the past at some point in his future, having been unable to access enough energy of the Speed Force. Eobard ordered Tina to accelerate the energetic properties within the tachyon device. But when Tina expressed doubts, Eobard vibrated his hand and calmly told Tina to learn or be killed.\n\nWar with the Flash[]\n\nVibed timeline[]\n\nAfter Tina finished the work at 9:52pm, Eobard killed his hostage anyway and used the tachyon device to return to his timeline. Because Cisco vibed this event 3 hours and 52 minutes in advance the Flash was given enough time to locate them.[5]\n\nChanged timeline[]\n\nAfter Tina finished the work at 9:52 pm, Eobard prepared to kill Tina anyway but the Flash arrived, subdued him, and destroyed the machine. Angered but soon unwavered by his nemesis's sabotage to his trip home, Eobard said he would find another way to travel to the future and boasted his superiority to the Flash before issuing a challenge to catch him. Both Reverse-Flash and the Flash began racing throughout the streets of Central City, but the Flash managed to anticipate his path and intercepted him, culminating with the Flash catching Reverse-Flash. The Flash proceeded to severely beat Reverse-Flash almost to death in a fit of rage for his future actions. Only reluctantly stopping himself from delivering a death blow, the Flash instead knocked him out and placed him in S.T.A.R. Labs' pipeline prison.\n\nDuring his imprisonment, Eobard was visited by Cisco Ramon/Vibe, asking how his ring worked. Confused yet curious, Eobard talked to Cisco and deduced he must have a history with him in the future, but was confused as to why the engineer only wanted to know how his ring worked. However, Cisco told Eobard of being the one that found him because of the young engineer's metahuman powers given by his future self. Cisco also revealed that Eobard would help build the very prison he was incarcerated in, leaving Eobard puzzled to learn of his future actions and developed an almost instant fascination with Cisco.\n\nEobard was later approached by the Flash (unmasked but concealed in the shadows), asking for his hatred's source. Eobard explained his obsession with his desire to be like his idol himself, so much that he spent years learning how his idol gained these powers and succeeded in replicating the reaction. Then he traveled through time and learned that he was going to become his own idol's greatest enemy, rather than be like the Flash. He opted to become the reverse of everything the Flash was, vowing to kill as many people as the Flash saved. As his former idol was disgusted to learn what was behind Eobard's motivations, even revealing that someone had been killed by Eobard's future self, Eobard angrily stated that he had become better than the Flash and was the one thing the Flash could never stop, and he promised that one day he would learn his nemesis's real name.\n\nShortly after, Eobard was approached by an intelligent individual and realized that his imprisonment has ruptured the timeline. However, Eobard doubted the individual knew how to send him back without Tina's tachyon device, but the man said he had instead developed an alternate method to send him home. Fascinated with his warden, Eobard asked the man's name, but the man refused to identify himself, claiming to be no one of consequence, yet Eobard was unconvinced and was instantly fascinated by the individual.\n\nEobard was released from his cell and informed of Team Flash's alternate method of sending him back to the future, to have both him and the Flash run at high enough speeds to create a wormhole through which Eobard can return to his own time. Eobard also gloated of winning again, mockingly speaking in the past tense for all his future actions. As they prepared, Eobard vowed the two would meet again and the Flash agreed but also vowed to stop him every time, and both the Flash and Reverse-Flash sped around the particle accelerator's ring. After gaining enough speed, the wormhole was created and the Flash hurled Reverse-Flash through the portal and Reverse-Flash successfully returned to his own time and plan his next attack.[5]\n\nWar in the past[]\n\nAfter his first showdown, Eobard would subsequently go on to travel through time again and again to the early 21st century to fight the Flash. The two speedsters would then fight each other in various different times, with neither one managing to defeat the other,[1] eventually to a point where they had \"been at this a long time\" as their fights as spanning over the course of centuries to which Eobard ended up confident of being one step ahead.[13] Whatever transpired, Eobard would sometimes ponder of \"which of us is right\" to hate the other and seemed to have some respect for his nemesis, acknowledging his former idol as a veteran hero and an intelligent individual who wouldn't use time travel for selfish or foolish reasons, unlike himself.[14]\n\nDuring his time-travels, Thawne learned about Cisco's \"great and honorable\" destiny as the superhero Vibe, as well as Dr. Caitlin Snow's alternate split personality Killer Frost.[15][16] In addition, Thawne became quite knowledgeable about his nemesis' other major enemies, including Clifford DeVoe/The Thinker, Savitar and David Hersch/Cicada; he considered himself a \"big fan\" of the Thinker's work and viewed Cicada as the \"one who got away.\"[17][18] Thawne learned about numerous other 21st century individuals and events, such as history books on the Starling City vigilante Oliver Queen/Green Arrow and hacker Felicity Smoak/Overwatch with the latter's recorded death at age 86 and lack of information on the former as well as the various women that have been known as the Black Canary.[19][20]\n\nLike most speedsters, Eobard had at least one encounter with the Time Wraiths, which he came to fear, trying his best to avoid as no speedster knew how to kill these creatures. Because of the Time Wraiths' dangers, Eobard became more strategic about his timeline alterations, only making necessary alterations to achieve his primary goal, and not recklessly upsetting history and risk being found by the Speed Force's enforcers.[21] He also became familiar with other speedsters, having been aware of Jesse Quick, Libby Lawrence, and Danica Williams.[21][18]\n\nAt some point in his personal timeline, Eobard learned how to travel through the multiverse. He may learned of Hunter Zolomon/Zoom of Earth-2 and Jay Garrick/The Flash of Earth-3; this can be attributed to his acknowledgement of a certain helmet.[1][4][18] Eobard also learned of the various doppelgangers of Harrison Wells, such as the version from Earth-1 who was the supposed reason that several meta-humans (including Flash) appeared thanks to the S.T.A.R. Labs particle accelerator which was successfully launched in 2020, Harry Wells and Harrison Sherloque Wells.[22][23][24] For unknown reasons, he fought Superman where the Man of Steel was fast while Eobard was faster, but their confrontation's details are unknown, only that Eobard told this to Supergirl of Earth-38.[20]\n\nAt some point, Eobard eventually learned his archenemy's real name: Barry Allen. He began studying the Allen family, learning of Henry Allen and Nora Allen[1], as well as Iris West-Allen[6][14] and Barry's and Iris's daughter (who was named Dawn in this timeline). He also somehow learned that Savitar was ironically a version of his nemesis from an alternate future who had an amusing \"pizza face.\"[18] Eobard began to develop a plan to finally defeat the Flash, which was to erase his former idol from existence by murdering Barry as a child.[1] But before that happened, Eobard wanted one more match against his enemy.\n\nCrisis of 2024[]\n\nReverse-Flash traveled to the midnight of April 25, 2024, and fought The Flash, Green Arrow, Atom and Hawkgirl in the streets of Central City, causing the most destruction the city had ever seen. The fight also somehow caused the sky to turn a deep crimson color. Their fight caused several trucks to start leaking their contents onto the streets, and caused power outages spread over 20 blocks throughout the city. The speedsters then started battling over two overturned tanker trucks, and the lightning emitted from them caused the oil from one of them to ignite. While sounded by smoke, the two speedsters had a very heated conversation on an unknown matter before speeding off, leaving Green Arrow, Atom, and Hawkgirl behind. The two then continued their fight up and down an unknown avenue before Flash and him vanished without a trace in an explosion of light.[25] According to Iris in 2049, some sources describing the battle claimed that Reverse-Flash controlled an army of shadow demons and that Flash was instead or also aided by Batwoman, Elongated Man and Supergirl.[26]\n\nTraveling to 2000[]\n\nDuring the explosion of light, Reverse-Flash traveled back in time to the night of March 18, 2000,[27] aiming to murder the 11-year-old Barry and erase his nemesis from existence as he had planned before, but he was pursued by the Flash from 2024, hindering his plans. The two fought inside the Allen house around Nora, each landing solid hits on each other but their skills were fairly equal. When the 11-year-old Barry entered the room, Reverse-Flash moved in for the kill, but Flash intervened and transported the younger Barry to safety 20 blocks away, much to Reverse-Flash's outrage. However, Reverse-Flash quickly theorized another way to achieve his goal: kill Nora and frame Henry for the crime in the hopes that such a tragedy would traumatize Barry enough to derail from his nemesis's destiny, and he'd be free to return to a future without Flash.[1]\n\nLife as Harrison Wells[]\n\nStranded in the past[]\n\nReverse-Flash grabbed a kitchen knife and stabbed Nora in the heart leaving Nora to die, and fled the scene to return to his own time which he hoped would now be one without the Flash, but he was stopped by a sudden loss of connection to the Speed Force. After Gideon confirmed that his powers fluctuated somewhat due to his latest time jump, Reverse-Flash realized that he was now stranded in the 21st century with no way back to his time, and he screamed in frustration.\n\nEobard soon realized that the reason for his unstable connection to the Speed Force was because his own status as a speedster was dependent upon Barry's. Therefore, if Barry never was Flash in the past, then Eobard never would have been Reverse-Flash in the future. With this revelation, Eobard realized he needed Barry to be a speedster in order to return to his own time.[22]\n\nIdentity theft[]\n\nA month after killing Nora,[28] Eobard traveled to Starling City to stalk Dr. Harrison Wells and Tess Morgan, knowing that the couple would create a particle accelerator in 2020 behind Barry's powers. Eobard spied on the couple while on a date where Harrison proposed S.T.A.R. Labs' concept to Tess downtown in Starling City. Eobard plotted to use Harrison's reputation and his own futuristic knowledge to recreate the particle accelerator himself as quickly as possible. Later that night, Eobard rigged the road with a spike strip and caused Harrison's car to crash, killing Tess and injuring Harrison. He dragged Harrison out of the car, and identified himself to Harrison as well as the terrified scientist's supposed role in 2020. Eobard then took out his appearance-stealing device, and attached one end to Harrison and to the other to himself, acclimating Harrison's DNA which literally made himself an identical duplicate on a genetic level while his victim died in the process. Afterwards, he buried Harrison's body in a grove near the bridge,[29] and took his victim's place in the car. When the police found him, he introduced himself under his stolen identity at that point.[22]\n\nThawne told the police the car crashed due to a tire blowout, thereby keeping Harrison's murder a secret. Thawne then moved to Central City to carry out his plan and build S.T.A.R. Labs there instead to ensure success, giving the cover story that he moved away from Starling City because of too many reminders of Tess.[30][29] Now officially as \"Harrison Wells\" to the public, Thawne devoted his life to S.T.A.R. Labs' creation and its particle accelerator, using past knowledge but taking precautions to ensure his plan would work, keeping close observation throughout Barry's whole life by setting up cameras all over Central City, and even in the West household, where Barry lived following Nora's death.[25] To avoid the Time Wraiths' attention, Thawne took precautions to avoid unnecessary timeline alterations.[21] Thawne also came to like Big Belly Burger as one the few reasons to stay in the 21st century since cows were extinct in his own time; however, he ultimately despised living in the 21st century, a situation he deemed \"barbaric\" and compared to \"living amongst the dead.\"[1]\n\nAlong with S.T.A.R. Labs' creation, Thawne built the Time Vault, a secret room accessible only via hand-print where he kept his belongings, including the Gideon program which was still able to stay informed of future events, including a newspaper article written by Iris on the crisis of 2024[31][32] which acted as a deadline as to Thawne's remaining time to harness Barry's speed and Thawne further used it to keep tabs on the timeline, and if any changes occurred, take the necessary steps to get the timeline back on track for his own sake.[31][33] Thawne kept his Reverse-Flash suit on a display case and stored a second suit away in the room.[13][34] He also set himself up in a mansion but he never kept any future belongings in his house itself for security reasons,[35] and also built what was later known as the speed lab.[36]\n\nShortly after, he began the particle accelerator's constructions but made some alterations first to ensure the dark matter released would spread throughout Central City, with the aim of creating a lightning bolt that would strike Barry with a connection to the Speed Force, though did not care that other people would either become meta-humans themselves or be killed.[35] To ensure Barry's cooperation when the time came, he built the particle accelerator to act as a time machine of sorts that Barry could use to go back and prevent Nora's death while Thawne could return to his time in the wormhole left behind as a result of this time venture. To account for the possibility of Barry's increasing speed against him, Thawne planed to exploit Barry's speed only when Barry was fast enough to time travel not one second later, thereby giving him enough opportunity to kill Barry if necessary.[1] To motivate Barry further when the time came, Thawne began working on a way to restore his own connection to the Speed Force via various tachyon technologies, thus giving him significantly faster speed than as compared to Barry's novice abilities. But because of his own unstable connection to the Speed Force, these fixes of tachyon energies would only be temporary and would unexpectedly vanish from time to time, leaving him powerless.[13][35]\n\nThawne observed Barry's personal life as an unseen influence, initially looking upon his future enemy with nothing but hate but soon growing fond of the youth (as he hated but the Flash's future version).[25] Thawne's actions had profound impacts on Barry's life both as the so-called \"man in yellow\" (an alternate name before his true alter ego was revealed) and as Wells. As the former, he became Barry's greatest fear and driving force to be a C.S.I. with the Central City Police Department, with Barry hoping to one day find some evidence of Henry's innocence and uncover the true killer's identity. As the latter, Barry would grow to idolize him and was described as being obsessed with him without knowing who he really was (an ironic reverse of events as Thawne had once been obsessed without knowing his former idol's identity either), not learning much about him despite reading his 600-page biography twice.[22][33] Thawne also kept just as close observation of Eddie and took whatever precautions were needed to ensure Eddie would continue their bloodline, thus ensuring his own existence.[6]\n\nAs Wells, Thawne met various CEOs, such as Simon Stagg and Robert Queen.[37][38] He knew Stagg wasn't really a philanthropist but a greedy and corrupt man famous for others' scientific achievements.[37] He once met Queen at a charity event, with one of the subjects of discussion being Oliver.[38] Thawne also thought of Felicity in his search for promising young minds to help with his work as he foresaw Felicity's \"great things\"[39] and became an acquaintance with a younger version of Tina because of Harrison, though Tina always sensed something was different after Tess's death.[40] At some point after Thomas Snow's faked death, Thomas kept in touch with several scientists (including Thawne) who created a secret video feed from S.T.A.R. Labs to the site that Thomas was hiding in the North Pole.[41]\n\nIn 2004, Thawne was approached by General Wade Eiling to work on a military project together to create soldiers with physic abilities, presenting new opportunities financially and scientifically and Thawne agreed. While working at S.T.A.R. Labs, Eobard adopted Grodd, a pet gorilla that he kept at S.T.A.R. Labs who he became close, with Grodd later viewing Thawne as a \"father.\" In 2009, Thawne learned that Eiling had been using Grodd as a test subject and was torturing the gorilla in the process. When Thawne discovered this, he berated Eiling in a furious argument with the general and cancelled the project, but still had \"big plans\" for Grodd.[42]\n\nSometime prior to 2011, Thawne hired Caitlin, Ronnie Raymond, and Hartley Rathaway as employees of S.T.A.R. Labs.[35] On Caitlin's first day, Thawne said \"A scientist's work is never finished.\"[43] Thawne grew especially close to Hartley during the particle accelerator's construction, often bonding through activities such as games of chess and the fact that Hartley was the only other person who knew how to speak Latin.[35] Thawne also hired Arthur Light, a man who developed a lethal high powered shockwave rifle. However, Eobard fired Arthur for apparent insanity around 2012.[44]\n\nIn 2013, Thawne hired an earlier version of Cisco, knowing of Cisco's engineering talents based on his first interaction with Cisco's future self in 2016. Thawne started growing close with Cisco, much to Hartley's dismay, though Thawne assured Hartley that Cisco wouldn't get in the way of their friendship.[35] At one point during the particle accelerator's construction, Thawne gave S.T.A.R. Labs' team a strict deadline to work on the synchrotron, causing the team to struggle.[45] Eventually, Hartley realized that the particle accelerator was faulty and could explode, threatening Thawne's plans. Thawne subsequently had Hartley fired and threatened to ruin Hartley's career if anyone was ever told.[35] After Hartley's termination, Thawne grew closer to Cisco and came to view Cisco as a surrogate son.[46]\n\nAt some point before the particle accelerator's launch, Channel 52 visited S.T.A.R. Labs, and Thawne spoke on how the particle accelerator's activation would revolutionize several fields of science overnight.[17]\n\nThe particle accelerator's explosion[]\n\nOn December 11, 2013,[47] Thawne held an event at which he planned to switch on S.T.A.R. Labs' particle accelerator. He began speaking on stage, claiming that the particle accelerator would create a brighter future, bringing advancements in power and medicine, as well as physics as they knew it.[31][48][18] After opening up to questions, Marlize DeVoe asked Thawne if he had indeed planned for every event and outcome after the particle accelerator's activation. Thawne recognized the DeVoe name and realized that Clifford was also there. He told Clifford of being a big fan, subtly hinting at the man's future as one of the Flash's greatest enemies, and wished Clifford luck.[17]\n\nBack in the cortex after the press conference, Cisco alerted Thawne of an oncoming storm, but Thawne assured Cisco that it would not effect the particle accelerator's activation.[48] As Thawne was about to turn the particle accelerator on, he got the sensation that something was amiss; Thawne's suspicion was indeed rightful as a version of Barry from 2018 and another speedster had time-traveled to 2013 and had just then entered S.T.A.R. Labs. Thawne left the room and walked towards the Time Vault, with the two speedsters having just phased inside. Before he could investigate, he was stopped by Cisco and Caitlin. Thawne asked Caitlin to have Ronnie run the particle accelerator's numbers one more time and to bring the bottle of Dom Pérignon out to celebrate. After Caitlin left, Thawne told Cisco of his belief that the youth would go on to do great things, subtly hinting at Cisco's future that he once witnessed. The two then attempted a handshake before heading back to the lab.[18] The particle accelerator was then switched on. As the team celebrated, however, particles began to behave abnormally, such as liquids floating in the air, followed by a loud bang from the particle accelerator. Thawne sent Ronnie and Cisco down to manually shut the particle accelerator down before anything bad happened.\n\nAfter Ronnie had vented the system to assure S.T.A.R. Labs' safety but was seemingly killed in the process, Cisco called Thawne down to the chamber. Thawne made his way down but before doing so, went into the Time Vault to see Barry struck by lightning, pleased to see that his plan worked.[48] The wave of energy from his resulting explosion also resulted in countless meta-humans and led to at least 16 people dying.[33] Additionally, Grodd was also affected by the particle accelerator, and the dark matter (combined with Eiling's drugs which had been injected years earlier) activated and mutated Grodd into a hyper-intelligent gorilla and escaped the cage; Thawne allowed Grodd to roam free in the sewers, continuing to grow in intelligence and size.[6] Thawne also suspected that Cisco was affected by the dark matter but could never confirm his suspicions as Cisco showed no signs of having powers.[1]\n\nFollowing the particle accelerator's explosion, Thawne was brought to Central City Hospital just as the comatose Barry was. He was recognized by Dr. Ambres who reported that he had no feeling below his waist. As the doctors examined him, Thawne watched Barry's comatose body being taken in.[18] Thawne began pretending to be paralyzed from the waist down, not just to keep suspicion of his future activities as Reverse-Flash away from himself, but also rigging his personal wheelchair with a machine to feed him a connection via tachyons and make him faster than even Barry and maintain his already ruptured connection to the Speed Force.[19] He also used the wheelchair to store a flash drive in which he kept his personal notes.[49]\n\nAfter Barry was put into a coma due to the lightning strike caused by the shock-wave, Barry's condition eventually went critical and Thawne convinced Joe West (Barry's foster father) to allow him to move Barry to S.T.A.R. Labs. However, Joe never fully trusted Thawne and knew something wasn't right but was so desperate to see Barry awake and ignored those feelings. While Barry was at S.T.A.R. Labs, Thawne remarked how amusing it was to see how helpless Barry was, and how easy it would've been to just kill then and there. He also remarked the irony of him going back to kill and now needing to ensure Barry's existence to return to his own time, and though remarking how interesting it's been watching Barry grow up. However, Thawne firmly stated \"nothing is forgiven\" and that one day Barry will die.[25]\n\nAt some point, Thawne cracked the multiverse's source code and discovered the time language which allows the user to retain knowledge of previous timelines due to its immunity to timeline changes, recording this presumably for personal usage.[49] Due to S.T.A.R. Labs' reputation being tarnished following the particle accelerator failure, Thawne ordered their Starling City branch to be shut down and the supplies moved back to Central City. Thawne sent Caitlin and Cisco to inventory supplies where the two unexpectedly encountered Deathstroke's army.[44]\n\nWorking with the Flash[]\n\nAfter Barry woke from the coma, Thawne was called down to the lab to talk to Barry. He took Barry around S.T.A.R. Labs, explaining what had actually happened on the night of the particle accelerator explosion and how they'd moved Barry. Before they could run more tests, Barry left. After having realized Barry had the ability to run at superhuman speed, Thawne and the team went to an airfield where they sought to test Barry's speed. Thawne cautioned restraint, although Barry instead ran at full pelt, accidentally running into barrels of water. Back at S.T.A.R. Labs, Barry told Thawne the story of Nora's murder and suspected belief that perhaps there were more powerful humans, perhaps like the man who murdered Nora, oblivious to the fact of talking to the very man responsible. Keeping this secret safe, Thawne told Barry of being most definitely unique.\n\nFollowing a later run-in with Clyde Mardon's weather manipulation, however, Barry returned, angry that Thawne had seemingly lied. He admitted fault, explaining that the explosion had released various forms of seemingly theoretical energy across the city, including anti-matter, dark energy, and x-elements. Barry mentioned planning to stop Clyde, though Thawne attempted to stop Barry from taking the risk, as Barry was incredibly important in terms of scientific advancement. Despite Thawne's claims that Barry was not a hero but only simply a boy who was struck by lightning, Barry furiously stormed out of S.T.A.R. Labs, determined to subduing Clyde.\n\nThough seemingly for scientific reasons, Thawne's words were clearly an attempt to sway Barry away from a heroic destiny and exploit Barry's powers without worrying about an impending death by other metahumans' hands. Following Barry's departure, Thawne eventually realized the only way to make Barry faster was to allow the youth to fight the other meta-humans, to push himself to his limits. As Barry struggled to unravel a tornado Clyde had made, Thawne intervened over the communication, apologizing, reassuring Barry that he did, in fact, believe, that Barry was a hero and could right Thawne's wrongs. Barry, encouraged by his mentor's words, then managed to unravel the tornado and stop Clyde. Thawne later went into his secret room and checked up on the future and was relieved to see the future was intact.[31]\n\nAfter having acted as a hero, Barry returned to S.T.A.R. Labs, where Thawne again cautioned restraint to Barry, telling his protégé to make sure to know limits. When Barry later tried to act the hero again and passed out, Barry was taken to S.T.A.R. Labs and despite being scolded, they decided to try some tests. Barry began running on a modified treadmill and the youth to eventually pass out, Thawne identified that it had to do with Barry's glucose levels due to an extremely fast metabolism processing it too fast. They hooked Barry up to 40 IV bags before the youth finally awoke. As they began discussing a new diet for Barry, Joe entered the room; Thawne was surprised to see Joe. He reassured Joe that they were looking out for what was best for Barry, though Joe disagreed that what they were doing was the way to do it, leading to an argument between Barry and Joe. After Barry returned to S.T.A.R. Labs after been beaten up by another meta-human identified by blood samples as Danton Black, Barry decided against trying to take Black down despite Thawne's support and was adamant that what they were doing was a mistake.\n\nFollowing that, Thawne went to talk to Joe. After briefly talking with Stagg, he claimed to Joe that next time Barry suited up, the youth would doubt himself. Thawne headed back to S.T.A.R. Labs, where Caitlin was able to grow a clone of Black from a replicating cell, so they called Barry in and explained this. The clone promptly awakened, presumably due to Black's prime self activating some clones, and Joe hurried in through the doors, shooting the clone and reassuring Barry that only a meta-human could stop meta-humans, realizing Thawne was potentially right. They talked to Barry when the youth reached Stagg Industries and Thawne noted that his protégé had to find Multiplex's prime self. After Barry gained the upper hand and attempted to save Multiplex from falling to death but Multiplex actually wished to die before forcibly letting go of Barry's hand and killing himself, the team watched a news report of it on the TV afterwards. Barry mentioned having tried to prevent Black's death, but Thawne reflected that sometimes people break and can't be put back together. Following that, Thawne visited Stagg with Stagg making claims to exploit the so-called Streak. Seeing Stagg's greed as an obstacle to his own plans for Barry, Thawne stood up from his wheelchair and fatally stabbed Stagg, claiming that the Flash (as his protégé would come to be known as) had to be kept safe.[37]\n\nAfter the Darbinyan crime family were gassed to death by a presumed meta-human, S.T.A.R. Labs' team began researching what they could, all of them excited by the potential prospects. Joe noted that they would have to find somewhere to hold a meta-human as Iron Heights was less than ideal and Cisco suggested the particle accelerator, Cisco and Thawne went down to the particle accelerator's core chamber. Thawne had to go do some modifications while Cisco waited (using the information he acquired from his own imprisonment in 2016). The two later assisted Barry in going after a mist-controlling meta-human inside the Central City Shopping Mall. However, Barry discovered that the man could turn himself into gas, and inhaled some of the toxic gasses, before racing back to S.T.A.R. Labs where the team painfully extracted the poisonous gas. The team was soon able to identify the makeup of the gas: hydrogen cyanide with traces of a sedative to which Barry figured that the two would be mixed in a death row execution and they identified the meta-human as Kyle Nimbus (proudly nicknamed The Mist by Cisco). Barry went to protect Joe (the next target) and the team supported this. Unable to outrun The Mist, they suggested Barry make The Mist tired, and would have to revert to physical, human form eventually; Barry succeeded and The Mist is taken back to S.T.A.R. Labs, where Nimbus was locked up in the prison.[48]\n\nThawne defeated Barry in a game of chess while Barry also played a game of table tennis with Cisco and a game of Operation with Caitlin. When Felicity visits S.T.A.R. Labs, Thawne greeted Felicity and was more than pleased to meet Felicity, noting he's aware of all the woman's accolades and that he always keeps an eye out for such talent. When Felicity questioned about the possible dangers of what Barry does, Thawne reassured Felicity that everything they do is to ensure Barry's safety and that Barry is in good hands. Thawne was later furious at Cisco for building a cold gun powerful enough to overcome Barry's speed abilities and kill without any consent by Thawne, though Cisco built it prior to Barry waking from the coma and was stolen by master thief Leonard Snart. After telling Cisco that weapons don't belong in S.T.A.R. Labs, Thawne ordered Cisco to track down where the cold gun is and to do so immediately. After Felicity left, Thawne noted Felicity was a remarkable young woman. Thawne told Cisco to never do anything as to build such a weapon again, though he was unaware of another weapon that Cisco had built which was also stolen.[39]\n\nWhen the metahuman Bette Sans Souci seemingly begun destroying facilities around the city, Barry revealed that Bette is being pursued by General Eiling to which Thawne revealed his history with Eiling. After Barry met with and convinced Bette not to kill a scientist Bette had a grudge against, Thawne and Caitlin tended to Bette at S.T.A.R. Labs. The team learned that Bette was affected by thermite when the particle accelerator went off and everything Bette touches explodes, thus why Bette was captured by Eiling and experimented on. However, Eiling personally tracked Bette but Thawne distracted the general long enough for Barry to get Bette out of the facility. When the team later learned that Bette's condition couldn't be reversed, Thawne met with Plastique, and manipulated Plastique into killing Eiling. Plastique is stopped by Barry then killed by Eiling but Bette's body began building up to an explosion, forcing Thawne to coach Barry on running on water to drop Bette's body in the water to explode safely. Thawne is later visited at S.T.A.R. Labs by Eiling to propose an alliance again but he refused and threatened the general's life if he is ever blackmailed again.[42]\n\nAfter Barry failed to stop Tony Woodward, Thawne told Barry they'd find a way to stop Tony, but told Barry to rest and heal for the time being. A day later, Thawne is visited by Joe, asking for help on Nora's murder case (as Joe did not know that Thawne was the murderer). When Joe asked if his particle accelerator was possibly involved, Thawne reminded Joe that the murder occurred 14 years ago long before his contraption was even thought of. After a few other suggestions from Joe, Thawne told the detective that the theories were all highly unlikely. After Barry tries to stop Tony alone, Thawne is furious as they had yet to find a way to stop Girder. Although Barry could just heal, Thawne said Barry can't heal after possibly being killed. Thawne then told Barry could stop Girder if only moving fast enough as any material can be struck at a high enough velocity.\n\nThe following day, Thawne had a drink with Joe, where Joe subtly suggested that Thawne was involved as he arrived in Central City shortly after Nora's murder. Thawne told Joe to look up Tess before leaving. Joe looked up Tess, later visiting Thawne at S.T.A.R. Labs and apologized for accusing him of murder. Thawne then told Joe about his \"past\" and why he moved to Central City as there were too many painful memories to endure (presumably acting on Harrison's memories). Later that night as Joe was reviewing the evidence of Nora's murder, Reverse-Flash reappeared and encircled Joe to frighten the detective, briefly allowing his suited face to be seen and stealing the evidence shortly afterward. Before leaving, Reverse-Flash left a death threat towards Iris by pinning a photograph of Iris to the wall with a knife, and the words \"stop or else\" to scare Joe away.[30]\n\nIn an entry in his personal log, Thawne noted that Barry was driven to use these powers to help people, but stated that this was keeping Barry from realizing full potential. He later told Barry to \"kick it up a notch\" in the training: Farooq Gibran attacked a transformer station, and Barry confronted Farooq but lost the speed abilities. When Thawne went to check on the future, he learned, to his shock and rage, that the timeline had altered; instead of the crisis in 2024, the future now told of the post office's permanent shutdown and there was no record of Flash. While Thawne desperately searched for a solution, Farooq attacked S.T.A.R. Labs seeking vengeance for his friends' deaths caused in the particle accelerator explosion, and caused a blackout that rendered the lab completely exposed to attack.\n\nTo stop Farooq, Thawne theorized that Barry's cells were still altered. If they could redirect dark matter directly into Barry, they could recharge his protégé's cells. As Cisco worked on using the treadmill as a conduit to achieve this, Thawne released Tony and offered freedom in exchange for killing Blackout to buy them enough time to achieve their plan though this came at the cost of Tony's life. Later, he had a brief argument with Barry about sacrificing Tony to stall Blackout, angrily insisting that he had merely done what was necessary, though Barry was disgusted that Thawne would so willingly sacrifice someone's life, unaware of the man's future reputation of doing just that.\n\nWhen Blackout cornered the team, Thawne confronted Blackout, reciting from memory the names of everyone who died in the particle accelerator disaster, and demanding that Blackout leave the others alone, saying that he was the only one who deserved to be punished. Blackout agreed and blasted him out of his wheelchair. He was seemingly helpless to move (though faking in reality), however, Barry finally regained his own speed and allowed Blackout to drain once more but the amount of power overloaded and killed Blackout, while the resulting energy fed back on the Flash and charged up his protégé's speed further. After the Flash defeated Blackout, Thawne made another log entry, stating that he had previously been mistaken and that Barry's desire to help others was the key to developing the Flash's potential, not an obstacle as he had thought. Thawne later took a blood sample from Farooq's corpse, while signaling The Mist to stay quiet, saying that he was interested in finding out how the Flash's powers were drained.[33]\n\nAfter Rainbow Raider robbed a bank by forcing everyone inside to go angry and attempt to murder each other, Thawne aided the team in figuring out how the man did. However, they were distracted by the appearance of The Arrow of Starling City who both Thawne and Joe distrusted, due to the vigilante's previous body count and the terrorist attacks committed by Malcolm Merlyn/Dark Archer and Deathstroke since Arrow was active. Barry, however, defend Arrow saying the vigilante is a hero and insisted the two were wrong but Thawne and Joe told Barry to see that Arrow is out of Central City by tonight. Thawne was already aware of Arrow's true identity (presumably because of his future knowledge). Later when the Flash suffered the effects of Rainbow Raider's powers and went crazy and tried to murder Eddie, Thawne insisted Felicity call Arrow for help, deliberately revealing Oliver's identity to Team Flash. Preparing a device to make Barry regain his own senses by correcting emotions via the colors of the emotional spectrum, Thawne and Joe arrived just as the Flash and Arrow fought and used the device to restore Barry's stability. After capturing Roy Bivolo, Oliver addressed Team Flash and Thawne also thanked Oliver for the help. Oliver left, felling that something was off about Thawne.[38]\n\nAs a thank you for their help, Barry gave Thawne, Cisco and Caitlin a Christmas present each, but Thawne declined Barry's offer of eggnog. To motivate his protégé further, Thawne planned to attack as Reverse-Flash. A few hours later, Reverse-Flash stormed Mercury Labs looking for a tachyon prototype device, killing the guards yet was unable to reach the device due to the doctor sealing it away and he stormed off. Thawne \"helped\" Joe and Barry track down Reverse-Flash by building a trap as Joe and Barry secured the bait. Reverse-Flash later spied on Barry as the youth talked to Iris. Barry then noticed him and ran after him, demanding to know why he killed Nora, but Reverse-Flash instead challenged Barry to a fight in a stadium. Reverse-Flash proved to be the better speedster, severely beating Barry down using several coordinated attacks. He told Barry already that they'd fought for a long time. He also told Barry it would be destiny to die at his hands as it was Nora's, leaving the young speedster very confused.\n\nLater S.T.A.R. Labs orchestrated the trap using the tachyon prototype and lured Reverse-Flash in, aided by Eddie's taskforce. Unknown to anyone, Thawne rigged a hologram of himself as Reverse-Flash that would answer only to Wells. Once the hologram was active, Thawne, Joe, Eddie and the taskforce went down stairs to confront Reverse-Flash. As Thawne addressed his hologram, the force-field appeared to fail to stabilize (but actually nobody was inside for it), and Thawne rushed into the force-field so fast to make it look like Reverse-Flash pulled him into the field to trap himself inside. In the force-field, Thawne created a life-like speed mirage of himself then suiting up as Reverse-Flash in his hologram's place and repeatedly punched his after image, making it appear to everyone else that Reverse-Flash was trying to kill him.[46] After the force-field disappeared when Joe sabotaged the machine, Reverse-Flash grabs the device to take to his secret room then reappears in the basement, and while still bouncing back and forth to maintain the speed-mirage of Wells. Reverse-Flash kills Eddie's taskforce in seconds without any effort but hesitates when he approaches Eddie, shoving the detective to the side rather than killing (since this would risk his own existence), and attacks Joe.\n\nReverse-Flash reminds Joe of being warned. But before he can kill Joe, the Flash intercepts and drags him outside. However, Reverse-Flash again proved superior to the Flash. But as he was timely stopped by a pyrokinetic meta-human, Reverse-Flash vowed their fight wasn't over and ran off. Arriving back in time to take his speed mirage's place, Thawne gets tended to by Caitlin and Cisco who profusely apologizes for the force-field failing. Though he assured Cisco it wasn't anyone's fault, Thawne expressed annoyance towards them for not informing him of Ronnie's survival, but assures Caitlin that they'll find Ronnie. As his wounds healed, Thawne later places the tachyon prototype on his Reverse-Flash suit. While watching his device harness its power, he says \"Merry Christmas\" with his distorted voice.[13]\n\nThawne, Cisco, and Caitlin continue to train to improve Barry's speed using a drone to fire at. After Cisco dubbed the man in yellow as the \"Reverse-Flash\" instead, Thawne approved of the name unlike Caitlin. After Leonard returned, Barry decided to pursue Leonard, though Thawne warned Barry that Reverse-Flash is a greater threat. Due to Leonard's threat, Thawne and Cisco presented the CCPD with a shield that could withstand Leonard's cold gun. During Barry's battle with Leonard and Mick Rory, Thawne realized the best way to let Leonard's and Mick's guns cross streams is to move slower.[50]\n\nThawne guided the Flash to detour the Royal Flush Gang. After a suggestion from Cisco, Barry, Cisco, Caitlin and Thawne all took a group picture together. Later that night, Thawne is in his mansion to get off his wheelchair. He received a phone call then gets attacked. After Barry, Cisco and Caitlin arrive, Thawne told them he won't require help with the case. Barry realized it couldn't have been a teenage prank and Thawne told Barry he knew who it was.\n\nOriginal timeline: After the Flash stopped Hartley from attacking Rathaway Industries, Hartley told the Flash of knowing of Thawne's secret. After Hartley is locked up in the meta-human prison, Thawne asked how Hartley figured out that the Flash worked with S.T.A.R. Labs and Thawne is told Hartley figured out through triangulation. Thawne leaves Hartley and taunted him by claiming to know his \"deep, dark secret\" which prompted a level of worry from Thawne. Thawne returned to his team and admitted he knew there was a chance of the particle accelerator explosion, yet choose to proceed because of the reward it could offer. After Hartley escaped the prison, Thawne ran out of his secret room but collapsed to the ground after losing his speed. Hartley approached Eobard and asked him if Hartley was still \"his guy.\"\n\nThawne later decided to regain his team's trust by publicly admitting he was aware of the chance of the particle accelerator exploding. He was then asked by Mason Bridge if he had any plans in the future of turning the particle accelerator on. When Pied Piper attacked the Keystone Cleveland Dam, the Flash is quickly stopped with sound waves though Thawne transmitted waves through the cars at the damn, stopping Pied Piper. Thawne then told he wished to one day regain the trust of the team but Barry told him he already had. Thawne later returned to the Time Vault, reporting to Gideon that his speed comes and goes. Gideon reports being unsure how longer the tachyon device is viable and Thawne told Gideon that it was only meant to be a temporary fix and the real end game was coming.[35]\n\nDue to a timeline change caused when Barry time-traveled from different places in time, most of these events have been erased and replaced by the following.\n\nCurrent timeline: As Pied Piper attacked Rathaway Industries but was stopped by the Flash from 2015, the Flash's 2016 version time-traveled to intervene and incapacitate the Flash's 2015 self before switching emblems to avoid confusion, causing an interference with the team's communication devices in the process. The Flash's 2016 self then proceeded to capture Pied Piper just like in the original timeline, taking the embittered protégé to S.T.A.R. Labs but confusing Thawne slightly. Hartley was subsequently locked up in the Pipeline prison before Barry remembered that Hartley escaped captivity in the original timeline by using EMTs within hearing aids, causing Barry to ask Cisco to test for explosives within Hartley's hearing aids much to Thawne's shock. Barry was correct, and Hartley was ordered to take out these hearing aids with Thawne offering to replace Hartley's with non-destructive ones. Thawne was then approached by Barry to present a new equation to getting faster, surprising Thawne to see that Barry had devised such a complex equation with Barry's knowledge in such a short time. As Barry returned after facing a ghost-like creature (which Cisco dubbed a \"Dementor\" from the Harry Potter books) that had attacked the C.C.P.D. and seeing the creature while running to stop Hartley, Thawne realized the answers to his recent confusion: The youth with them hailed from the future and the so-called \"Dementor\" was a Time Wraith from the Speed Force who'd followed its target back. Thawne invited Barry into his quarters to discuss the speed equation. With Barry's back was turned, Eobard stood up and knocked Barry out, claiming that he \"figured it out.\"\n\nLater while waiting for Barry's 2016 version to wake up, Thawne was visited by another future version of Barry from 2018 with Nora West-Allen. Thawne mistook Nora's name for Dawn, and mocked Barry on the idea of having at least one woman with Nora's name as well as questioning a transmitter device he was convinced to fix so that his master plan to get back to his time can apparently continue. But when the two get into an argument, Nora tells Thawne the device is for Cicada, and Thawne laughed at the idea of Cicada being stopped. Knowing that Barry's 2016 self would be waking up soon, Thawne reluctantly agreed to help while offering Nora water.\n\nIn the lab, Thawne gave Nora water, and questioned how Barry would get Cicada's dagger to which Nora answered by showing him a piece of Savitar's suit. Thawne was stunned and mocked how Barry hated him with a passion, yet Savitar from an erased future was a way \"bigger jerk\" then he ever was. Thawne, however, praised Barry's idea to use a piece of Savitar's suit to defeat Cicada, but complimented the \"clever girl\" after learning it was Nora's idea. After repairing the tool, Thawne bid farewell to the two speedsters and quickly ran to the Time Vault, preparing to talk to Barry's 2016 version. Knowing Nora was still watching him from the lab, Thawne waved at the camera before Nora left.[18]\n\nAfter Barry's 2018 version and Nora went to 2013, Thawne interrogated Barry's 2016 version but the youth played dumb. Thawne sped in plain view and saw Barry didn't even flinch. Barry then attempted to phase out of the cuffs but failed, further proving the fact that the youth hailed from the future as Thawne had yet to teach his protégé how to phase. Finally Barry referred to him by real name, thus confirming Thawne's theory. Barry told Thawne of needing him to teach how to get faster. However, Thawne quickly realized that Barry being alive in the future could only mean his own plan failed and tries to kill Barry in a rage. However, Barry quickly claimed that Thawne did win, and that he'll be successful into using Barry's speed to get back to his own time. Unfortunately, a singularity had formed and that's why Barry is in the past, to get faster in order to stop it but needed Thawne's help. Thawne saw this as an opportunity to curb his bloodlust, but Barry claimed that there's a letter left for his protégé if something happened, detailing Thawne's plan worked and how to stop him. Thawne reluctantly listened to Barry.\n\nAt the same time, the Time Wraith found a way to S.T.A.R. Labs and attacked Cisco, Caitlin and Hartley but they were able to fend it off just as both Thawne and Barry arrive via speed. When Cisco and Caitlin leave for solutions, Barry asked Thawne how to kill a Time Wraith but Thawne revealed there is no known way to kill these creatures hence why speedsters try to avoid them. As Barry searched the police department for any clues, Thawne searched S.T.A.R. Labs, but Cisco and Caitlin were unable to replicate the frequency Hartley used to stop the Time Wraith. As they debated how to stop the Time Wraith, Barry of the present day showed up just as Barry of the future returned. To shut up Barry of the future accidentally revealing future knowledge trying to convince the team of being from the future, Thawne played dumb and pretended that he'd just met Barry of the future, and told the team to prepare the particle accelerator, telling Barry of the future to travel through time to outrun the Time Wraith, while they build a sonic weapon to stop the Time Wraith for good when returning with Barry to 2016. Before sending Barry back, Thawne gave Barry a drive with on tachyon enhancement information, and Flash successfully made it back to the future with Thawne's speed increasing information.[21]\n\nAfter Shawna Baez broke Clay Parker out of Iron Heights, Joe deduced Clay was a meta-human, however, Thawne corrected Joe, stating there was a woman's DNA matched with Clay's. Using the DNA, they learn the DNA belonged to Shawna. After learning Shawna's powers, Thawne told Barry they should focus on learning Shawna's limits. The following day, Thawne learned from Cisco that Hartley was let out of the meta-human prison by Cisco, much to his disappointment. Thawne later learned Peek-a-Boo can't teleport in dark space, as Peek-a-Boo can only teleport to what Peek-a-Boo can see. When the Flash went after Peek-a-Boo, he reminded the Flash that Peek-a-Boo can't teleport if the woman couldn't see, leading to the Flash busting out all the lights in the tunnel.[51]\n\nAfter Firestorm attacked Quentin Quale, Thawne tells the team letting Ronnie roam free was no longer an option. Thawne and Caitlin decide to have a stakeout outside of Clarissa Stein's home, assuming Firestorm would be nearby to watch over Clarissa. While waiting for Firestorm, Thawne swore to Caitlin that his work won't be finished until he brings Firestorm back to normal. Shortly after, Firestorm came by and the two quickly contacted Barry who fights Firestorm until Caitlin interrupted. After learning Firestorm's two halves could be separated, Thawne said it was possible, but only theoretically as splitting a human and an atom were different concepts.\n\nThawne learned that Firestorm's form was in rejection, causing an exothermic reaction and a possible nuclear explosion. Due to the two only have hours before Firestorm's body detonates, Thawne suggested they may have to kill Firestorm. While the team were outraged of the concept, Thawne told them that Firestorm would likely sacrifice themselves. In the Time Vault, Thawne pulled a hand gun and Gideon said it was a crude weapon. Thawne then decided to make a quantum splicer using the tachyon device, though Thawne is told it would delay his timeline. Thawne told Gideon there would be no timeline if Central City gets blown up. Cisco and Thawne built the tachyon device which is given to Barry and Caitlin to take to Firestorm. After the splicer was placed on Firestorm, Thawne tells the two to get away from Firestorm.[43]\n\nThawne greeted Ronnie, thanking Ronnie for sacrificing himself to protect those around and is introduced to Professor Martin Stein. Thawne then did medical work on Martin, checking if the professor still had the ability to harness nuclear energy. Thawne learned Martin's unable to and reported this to the team. When Eiling attacks Ronnie, Thawne pays a visit to the general. Eiling asked Thawne to surrender Firestorm, Thawne refused but the general brought up the Flash's identity. While conversing with Martin, Thawne spiked the professor's drink. With Martin passed out, Thawne contacted Eiling, and Eiling took Martin away. Thawne claimed to the team he was left helpless when Eiling came by to take Martin. Barry was determined go after Eiling, but Thawne reminded Barry what Eiling could do.\n\nIn search for Martin, the team used Ronnie as the two are still connected and Eobard convinced them both to use the quantum splicer to merge again, but this time accept the balance they successfully became more stable as Firestorm. Fixing another obstacle, Reverse-Flash later abducts Eiling from a military office to Grodd's \"home\" in the sewers. Unmasking himself, Thawne told Eiling that he protects metahumans (his own kind) and unleashed Grodd both to silence Eiling, and for vengeance for what the general did to Grodd years before.[52]\n\nIdentity revealed[]\n\nThawne and Cisco pass the time at S.T.A.R. Labs watching old Buster Keaton movies. Cisco was shocked of never seen this before, while Thawne sarcastically remarked \"must have been before my time\" and approved Cisco's request to make a list of movies to see. However, Thawne also reminded Cisco of Dante Ramon's birthday party but Cisco decided the best thing was to not go at all, remarking how things had been much better since Cisco stopped seeing Dante. Though Thawne is saddened to learn Cisco was still on bad terms with the Ramon family, they were distracted by an alert of a break in at the Central City Morgue, though Thawne gets confused as to why anyone would rob a morgue.\n\nOriginal timeline: When Barry returns, they all find out that Mark Mardon is the killer and on a vendetta to avenge Clyde; Thawne deduced Mark was affected by the particle accelerator the same way Clyde was. Thawne is later told by Barry that his protégé saw himself while running toward the morgue. Thawne says it could've been a speed mirage or an illusion. Thawne then told he would further investigate this after Mark is taken in, though Thawne seemed to be aware that Barry saw a future version of himself. A couple days later, Caitlin took Thawne to Jitters for a coffee. When Caitlin insisted they enjoy their drinks at Jitters, Thawne reluctantly agreed yet noticed Caitlin acting nervous around him. While talking, Thawne realized that Caitlin was trying to keep him distracted and away from S.T.A.R. Labs. Thawne suggested they could adjust the satellite to possibly pick up a storm to help catch Mark. When Thawne told Caitlin that they should go to S.T.A.R. Labs to alert Cisco, Caitlin turned around to get their coffee in to go cups but Thawne (now sure Caitlin was distracting him) takes off, leaving behind his wheelchair and revealing his deception to Caitlin.\n\nWhen Cisco had discovered a hologram was used that night, Thawne reveals his true identity to Cisco. Thawne revealed to Cisco that his original intent was to kill Barry as a child and not Nora, and revealed that he'd only been training Barry as a means to an end, as his protégé's speed was the key to returning to his time. Thawne said nothing would stop him from returning to his home, though Cisco offered help. Thawne noted Cisco to be smart, but not smart enough to bring him back to his time. Thawne phased his arm through Cisco's chest, killing the protégé who showed him what it was like to have a son, and left the building.[46] Because Barry time-traveled by accident for the first time, these events never occurred and instead are replaced by the following.\n\nCurrent timeline: Barry stopped after running, confusing Thawne and Cisco and reminded Barry to get to the morgue but Barry claimed to have been there yesterday, confusing them both. When Barry returned, they're all told that Weather Wizard is the killer and on a vendetta to avenge Clyde and Thawne deduced Mark was affected by the particle accelerator the same way Clyde was. However, Barry finished Thawne's sentence and correctly guessed almost every word Cisco and Caitlin were about to say to each other before the two did. With this, Thawne realized that Barry had in fact time traveled. After learning Barry had traveled back one day, Thawne stressed the importance to his protégé of keeping history intact which meant repeating the events of the day again without and to not tell anyone or alter anything. Thawne checked in with Gideon but is assured the future remained intact.\n\nBarry, however, ignored Thawne's advice and went and captured Mark anyway before Mark could commit these crimes. Angered that Barry had altered time, Thawne reminded his protégé that whatever tragedies time had averted would somehow replaced with even worse ones. Thawne had Barry run on the treadmill in an attempt to re-create the conditions that allowed Barry to time travel in the first place, but even Barry's highest speeds couldn't achieve it. After learning that Leonard had returned with Lisa Snart and kidnapped Cisco, Thawne begun trying to track Cisco down but Barry begged Eobard to talk about the previous yesterday and Thawne reluctantly agreed. Barry states that Weather Wizard was about to destroy the city and Iris admitted to have feelings for Barry. Thawne reminded Barry the feelings were buried deep in Iris's consciousness and remained unrealized without Mark's actions, Barry's powers could furthermore cause serious havoc upon the world.\n\nCisco returns to S.T.A.R. Labs tearfully quitting the team in shame, having been released by Leonard and Lisa after revealing the Flash's secret identity or Dante would've been killed, however, Thawne reminded Cisco that choosing between loved ones is an impossible choice and Cisco regardless is still family and stays. Reverse-Flash later went to Central City Picture News and attacks Mason for writing an article implicating Wells (Thawne) to Stagg's murder and Eiling's disappearance. Learning from Bridge that everything about him was on a drive, Reverse-Flash killed Mason. To cover his tracks, Reverse-Flash then noted that the reporter was really was onto something. He destroyed all the evidence, fixed the office, and moved Mason's body. Later at S.T.A.R. Labs, Thawne consulted Barry's decision to let Leonard go. Barry was about to ask Thawne something but halted, and Thawne asked what Barry's question was. Barry simply said it was nothing wished him goodnight, to which Thawne returned.[53]\n\nWhen a terrorist known as the Trickster attacked the park by dropping bombs disguised as presents, Thawne assisted the team in searching for a means to locate this new individual identified as the Trickster. However, Thawne noticed Barry seemed cranky but Joe assured him that Barry was just having a bad morning. Later when the Trickster made another broadcast, Barry showed further signs of angst towards Thawne but he surmised it must be because of Barry's previous visit with James Jesse in prison brought back memories of Henry's incarceration. When the Trickster uploaded a broadcast informing the public of a bomb in the city and left it's rough location, the Flash failed to find it but Thawne realized it was a trick but the Flash refused to listen to him much to everyone else's confusion. Thawne's proven right as there was no bomb and it was a diversion so the Trickster, now identified as Axel Walker, could break Jesse out of prison and take Henry hostage.\n\nWhen the two Tricksters made their move to poison everyone at a fund raiser held by Mayor Bellows, Iris called Joe on the cellphone to clue in and Thawne begun working on the antidote to the poison. However, the Flash had a bomb placed on by Axel which would explode if the Flash didn't run faster than 600 miles an hour or try to remove it, so Thawne taught the Flash how to phase through a truck which separated the Flash from the bomb. After succeeding in foiling the Trickster's plot, Barry brought Henry to S.T.A.R. Labs to meet everyone where Henry thanked all of them for their efforts, especially Thawne. When Thawne remarked how remarkable Henry was and how lucky Barry is, Barry said the same about Thawne. However, Thawne knew that Barry's beginning to suspect who he really was.[22]\n\nThawne helped Barry investigate Lindsay Kang's strange death at the hands of numerous honey bees, but where interrupted when Felicity arrived with aspiring superhero Ray Palmer seeking help on Ray's suit. After the bees took Bill Carlisle as a second victim, one of the bees followed Barry back to S.T.A.R. Labs while Barry, Felicity and Ray were out to dinner with Iris and Eddie leaving only Caitlin, Cisco and Thawne to fend off the bees. When the bee came for him, Thawne almost broke his own cover to evade it but Barry arrived in time to stop it. They shockingly discovered it wasn't a bee at all but a robot and learned the previous victims worked at Mercury Labs and paid a visit to Tina. His \"old friend\" confirmed the bees were Brie Larvan's work but the bees went after Tina while Brie herself was sheltered some miles away, so Barry and Ray teamed up to stop Brie and the bees while Thawne and Felicity assisted over communications.[40]\n\nAfter the Flash failed to catch up to a thief who could change into any person of any age, Thawne was worried that this meta-human could copy Barry's likeness and speed and told his protégé to stay away from the criminal, which is eventually confirmed to be Hannibal Bates. After Bates goes on a killing spree while posing as Eddie, and infiltrated S.T.A.R. Labs while posing as Barry then came close to killing Iris and Caitlin, Thawne figured out Everyman's deception, as the imposter's left-handed whereas Barry's right-handed, and used a taser to force Everyman into unconsciousness. After Joe and Cisco returned from Starling City, Thawne gave his regards to Eddie and talked to Joe about the visit, but Joe questioned why he never went back. Thawne again lied and claimed it was because of Tess but reflected that they had one trait in common of being widowers, regarding Iris's mother who Joe never talked about and Thawne presumed dead as a result, and Thawne offered to have another drink with Joe sometime which Joe agreed to.[29]\n\nThawne later returned to the Time Vault to ask for an update from Gideon but he's assured that everything was fine, unaware that Barry, Cisco and Caitlin were in his secret room just seconds before. He later helped Cisco and Caitlin work on a device to induce lucid dreaming, which they claimed was for physiologists dealing with people traumatized by meta-human incidents. Thawne later called and informed Barry of a fire in a building nearby. The Flash was unable to retrieve all the civilians before the fire burnt out of control to which Thawne told the Flash to rotate his own arms at high velocities which extinguished the flames. After Thawne returned from a conference, Caitlin informed him that Cisco finally figured out how Reverse-Flash \"escaped\" and Thawne realized his cover was blown. Thawne sent Everyman to pose as Wells and spring the trap the team had set for Thawne as a means to get a confession to Nora's murder. After Joe killed Bates, Thawne finally dropped his façade and addressed the team via the intercom, admitting to using Bates as a distraction by promising freedom. As Barry and Caitlin expressed their anger for ruining everyone's lives, Thawne actually claimed that his actions have actually improved their lives, even admitting that he had grown to love working with the team. Barry angrily told Eobard in having a confrontation, and Thawne assured his former protégé that they would fight again, very soon. Thawne then quickly returned to S.T.A.R. Labs to retrieve his Reverse-Flash suit from the Time Vault before leaving once again.\n\nTo secure leverage, Reverse-Flash ambushed Eddie and Iris, just as Eddie was proposing and knocked out Eddie before moving in on Iris. Before Reverse-Flash could kill Iris, the Flash arrived and Reverse-Flash abducted Eddie instead, taking Eddie to his secondary lair underneath S.T.A.R. Labs.[6] Upon hearing that Eddie was already aware he wasn't Wells, Reverse-Flash decided to reveal his true identity and relation to Eddie, answering Eddie's questions as to why he didn't kill Eddie at Christmas, and referring to Eddie as his \"insurance.\"[25]\n\nTo distract Team Flash, Thawne ordered Grodd to be a distraction using whatever means Grodd saw fit while he constructed a device to re-power the particle accelerator, while keeping Eddie tied to a chair. Eddie continued questioning his claims but Thawne stood by his pride, considering Eddie to be the one failure in the Thawne family (consisting of Eddie's father, mother, grandmother and descendants which are also Eobard's ancestors). He then showed his ancestor the newspaper from 2024 shows that Iris is destined to marry Barry. Thawne later finished his device and activated the particle accelerator.[6] Before leaving, Thawne tried to justify himself to Eddie by asking to reflect on Eddie's own life and think of all the things that define it and what would to do if having lost everything, if to simply accept this new life or get back everything lost.\n\nAfter the particle accelerator's reactivation, Reverse-Flash escaped the facility with Barry in pursuit but released Peek-a-Boo as a distraction for the rest of the team. Despite Barry's efforts, his former protégé was unable to keep up, and Reverse-Flash escaped. Thawne returned 36 hours later when the particle accelerator was ready for reactivation, but Barry stopped him outside. Thawne commended Barry's failed but brave attempt to transport the meta-human prisoners to safety, having been foiled by Captain Cold earlier after being forced to reluctantly work with, but justified his own actions as necessary and only doing what he needed to. As Barry asked about his plan, Thawne invited his former protégé inside to show but Barry didn't fall for his deception. Thawne questioned Barry's plan to face him again since Barry failed every time before, but suddenly Firestorm and Al Sah-him arrived. Despite being outnumbered, Thawne was unfazed and confident he could fight the three, and he engaged them all at once.\n\nReverse-Flash and the Flash fought but Reverse-Flash managed to subdue the Flash and sent Firestorm flying miles away, forcing the Flash to save Firestorm. Al Sah-him was able to hit him with an arrow laced with nanites (courtesy of Atom) which delivered a high-frequency pulse that disabled Reverse-Flash's speed, keeping him from running for \"quite a while\" and forcing him to fight Al Sah-him in hand to hand. When his speed recovered, he pinned Al Sah-him to the ground, taunting Oliver's apparent original future death at age 86, and prepared for the kill only for the Flash to save Al Sah-him. The speedsters then fought all over S.T.A.R. Labs. As both the Flash and Reverse-Flash reached the edge of S.T.A.R. Labs' roof, Firestorm intervened and blasted Reverse-Flash off before Al Sah-him finished him off with another arrow of nanites, emitting a high frequency pulse that disabled his speed and kept him from recovering temporarily.[19]\n\nCeasing to exist[]\n\nThawne was placed inside the pipeline. Sometime afterward, Barry visited him to get answers, addressing him by his real name, and asked why he killed Nora. Thawne explained their feud, the circumstances and reasoning for Nora's murder, and that he needed Barry to be a speedster in order to generate enough energy from the Speed Force to create a wormhole though which he could return home, and Barry could simultaneously return to the night of Nora's murder thus undo Henry's imprisonment and Thawne's actions. Barry didn't believe him but eventually opened up to his plan. While enjoying a Big Belly Burger, Thawne explained that his plan required using the particle accelerator, explaining that Barry would have to run at Mach-2 speed through the particle accelerator and collide with a single hydrogen particle. Doing so would send Barry back to any time desired and create a wormhole behind which could be used by Thawne to return to his own time. But what Thawne neglected to tell Team Flash is that doing so would result in a singularity's creation. When he gets chastised by Team Flash, he assured them they would have enough time for both to achieve their goals, 1 minute and 52 seconds, and once accomplished they would be able to close the portal.\n\nWhile building a potential time machine for Thawne, Cisco visited him for advise on materials. Cisco also asked how his Reverse-Flash ring worked (reminiscent of Eobard's first meeting with Cisco in 2016). After he tells Cisco what's required, Thawne gets infuriated and confused that Cisco didn't have as much sympathy, comparing his predicament stuck in a different time to Cisco's own family estrangement. Cisco then revealed to Thawne that he killed his surrogate son in an erased timeline. Thawne apologized, not for killing Cisco and justifying that he had a good reason, but to learn that Cisco is indeed a meta-human as he'd suspected for sometime and informed Cisco what awaited his son-esque protégé. The Flash eventually prepared for the jump and ran at the speed required and Thawne tutored on how to access the time the Flash wanted, and successfully time jumped to that night to prevent the Allen family from suffering Eobard's actions.\n\nAfter the singularity opened, Thawne admired Cisco's Time Sphere, admitting that its original creator would be impressed. After a strange helmet arrived, Thawne knew this it was time to leave and bid farewell to Cisco and Joe. As he's to take off, the Flash returns and destroys Thawne's pod. Enraged, he asked why the Flash didn't save Nora and would have had \"everything [Barry] ever wanted\" but the Flash simply told him of already having it. The Reverse-Flash spitefully charged at the Flash and the two speedsters fought. As Team Flash worked to close the portal, Reverse-Flash beat the Flash into submission and prepared to kill the Flash, vowing to kill everyone else his former protégé loved, including Henry. As he declared his victory and dived in for the kill, Eddie shot himself in the heart, causing Reverse-Flash's body to flux uncontrollably as his existence began to fade. As Eddie's heart failed, Thawne started fading out of existence as his face reverted from Wells's likeness back into his original form since Eddie just erased the Thawne family after Eddie and before Eobard.\n\nAfter Eddie died of the self-inflicted injury, Eobard's body begun to crack apart as he arrogantly joked that he had controlled Barry's life for so long and asked how to get along without him, right before his body was incinerated and his existence erased from the timeline. However, his actions remained intact, which caused a paradox that reopened the singularity. The singularity engulfed Eddie's body,[1] caused Ronnie's death when Firestorm helped the Flash to close the singularity,[27] and later served as a doorway to Earth-2.[54]\n\nVideo will[]\n\nIn the event of his demise and his plan to return to his own time were to fail, Thawne made a video confession to Nora's murder for Henry's freedom. Initially, Thawne stood his ground in saying that Barry will never truly be happy, and believed he himself was never really the enemy but the real enemy was in fact Barry himself. Thawne then confesses to Nora's murder, much to his former protégé's and Caitlin's shock and delight.[27]\n\nReturn[]\n\nTraveling to Earth-X[]\n\nThawne was able to preserve himself in the timeline, returning to life once again using the Negative Speed Force,[15] and retained his memories from his years with Wells's likeness.[55][20] He traveled to Earth-X and encountered the New Reich, meeting der Führer/Dark Arrow (Oliver's Earth-X counterpart), along with the Schutzstaffel generals Overgirl and Prometheus. Thawne joined the elite SS forces, modifying his Reverse-Flash suit to add a complex mask and the SS double lightning runic symbol, being one of the high-ranked SS generals by leading the research regarding invasions of other universes and being the designer of the Wellenreiter.[20] While the Führer's agenda was related to Overgirl's overwhelming sun radiation poisoning resulting in an incurable health condition, Thawne wished to use the New Reich to conquer Earth-1 and remake the world by his own rule.[55]\n\nEarth-1's invasion[]\n\nIn late 2017, the Führer captured dimensional transporter technology from rebels led by a vigilante, and the New Reich made plans to invade and take over Earth-1. Reverse-Flash later reunited with Dark Arrow and Overgirl at Earth-X without Prometheus after attacking Barry's and Iris's wedding, calling out the couple's strike as foolish, as his co-conspirators hadn't been fully prepared yet. The Führer said that there was an opportunity to be seized to which Thawne said the opportunity had cost Prometheus being captured. Overgirl quickly stepped in to stop the arguing between the two and to save it for their enemies.[56]\n\nAfter Prometheus's suicide, the three New Reich Generals ventured back to Earth-1, managing to steal a device needed to give the Wellenreiter a \"doomsday device\" capability similar to a neutron bomb. Confronted by Kara Danvers/Supergirl, Green Arrow and the Flash, the SS Generals revealed their identities, with Thawne especially reveling in still using Wells's likeness \"for old times sake\" and in how he was still alive despite all of his initial erasure from existence, taunting the Flash with this. After a brief fight with the superheroes, the SS Generals escaped with the device, allowing Thawne to work closer on the Wellenreiter. As he worked, he was once again approached by Overgirl, and he asked to make sure that the Führer remembers the mission of conquering Earth-1, instead of only focusing on Overgirl's survival. Thawne brought how everything fell apart for the original Führer, to which Overgirl replied that their leader is ten times what Earth-X's original leader was, and wouldn't allow passions to cloud a sense of duty. Thawne would later assist the Schutzstaffel troops in capturing the Earth-1 superheroes, Alex Danvers and Supergirl.[55]\n\nThawne was put in charge of managing Overgirl's heart transplant operation at S.T.A.R. Labs, intending to weaken Kara with a simulated red sun, cut out Kara's heart and transplant to Overgirl's body. Reveling at his old workplace by taking a drive in his wheelchair once again, Thawne mentioned how he hated this life for fifteen years and wished to escape. Toying with Kara, he gets ready to begin his operation, but the electricity was cut off by Felicity and Iris, stopping the New Reich's plans even as the Wellenreiter entered Earth-1. Capturing Felicity, Thawne threatened to kill Felicity if the code needed to remove the computer virus isn't revealed, which the hacker eventually did after Kara pleaded not to throw their lives away.[20]\n\nNevertheless, the pause allowed the Legends to reach S.T.A.R. Labs in time, with Atom shrinking to microscopic level, forcing Thawne's scalpel away from Kara, before enlarging himself and blasting the SS Generals away (including Thawne). Informing the Führer that Overgirl could no longer be held safe in S.T.A.R. Labs, Thawne was ordered by the two to rejoin the New Reich forces on the Wellenreiter, despite his protests. During the chaos of escaping, Eobard encounters Harry. Thawne intended to vibrate his hand through Harry's chest, but Harry's body was filled with nano-robots that would reject any speedster contact, causing Thawne to flee.[57] Reverse-Flash would assist the New Reich's assault on Central City, primarily tasked with fighting the Flash. During the two speedsters' long fight, Thawne was overwhelmed by the Flash trying to perform Reverse-Flash's own vibrating hand trick on him. Thawne screamed at Flash, urging his nemesis to finish him; whether out of genuine desire to fall at the Flash's hand or as part of some reverse-psychology scheme. One way or another, the Flash refused to kill Thawne, telling him to just get away from the battlefield. Thawne agreed and taunted Flash by wondering what face he'd wear the next time they'd meet. Grinning smugly, Reverse-Flash raced away, abandoning his Earth-X allies to eventually die.[23]\n\nImprisonment in Iron Heights[]\n\nAt some point after this in his personal timeline,[58] Thawne traveled to the future for unknown reasons and somehow ended up as a prisoner at Iron Heights' meta-human wing, circa 2034; it's implied that the CCPD was responsible for his imprisonment.[59] He was forced to wear a jumpsuit containing Cicada's lightning dagger that would negate his powers along with the power dampeners in his cell.[60] Despite keeping Wells's face and voice, Thawne's hair partially reverted to its natural color and showed his natural age due to the dagger negating his powers.[15] His guard Trevor Shinick would come in from time to time to inflict a painful shock to Thawne, saying it was \"time to repent.\" Thawne would spend the next fifteen years imprisoned in Iron Heights with appearently customized set-up similiar to the Time Vault until he was scheduled for execution in 2049 with a clock counting down to his execution installed, and only had one visitor during his imprisonment.[59] Thawne knew that Cicada is the one villain the Flash wasn't able to stop, which is why Cicada's dagger was never destroyed, thus he wanted to use that information to his advantage. Thawne remembered the encounter he had with Barry in 2015 when Nora pointed out Cicada is involved, giving him the idea to earn Nora's trust and use as a tool to manipulate the timeline so he patiently bided his time until when Nora approached him.[15]\n\nIn 2049, with days to go before his execution, Thawne is visited by Nora. Now that his plan is finally able to come into motion, he convinced Nora that he was not a threat by listing off the ways his cell was speedster-proof with a backup in case of failure. He was bemused when all the CSI wanted to know about was about a robbery from a chemical lab. Thawne rebuffed Nora's questions about how to stop a speedster, but quickly deduced that Nora was a speedster by physical clues. As Nora begged him to help, Nora got led out of the cell while Shinick came in. Thawne knelt, and Trevor delivered a painful shock complete with red lightning, as Nora watched this with horror.\n\nAfter Godspeed had killed Nora's best friend, Thawne is begged by Nora on how to defeat a speedster, while Thawne did not want to. Nora pleaded and eventually Thawne gave in. He guided Nora via comms from his cell to the stabilizing agent that Godspeed needed to keep Velocity 9 in Godspeed's system, and listened as Nora ran from the Velocity-enhanced speedster. Knowing Nora could not outrun Godspeed, Thawne gave Nora the same speech he gave Barry on how to phase. Unlike Barry, Nora could not try to phase, so Thawne suggested that Nora hit Godspeed with electromagnetic pulses from Central City Citizen Media's satellite dishes. Thawne's plan worked, and Godspeed was arrested.\n\nNora visited again as Thawne enjoyed a Big Belly Burger, claiming that Nora could learn a lot from him. Thawne quietly admitted that he could not teach Nora due to his time running out, as he noted the clock in his cell, which read a little over an hour left. Nora realized that the clock was actually a countdown to his execution, and the Big Belly Burger was Eobard's last meal. Thawne asked what Nora knew of the Flash, and guided the young speedster to the Time Vault inside the Flash Museum, where Nora discovered from Gideon that Barry was the Flash and uncovered Barry's final video message to Nora that was recorded during the Crisis of 2024.[59]\n\nWhile keeping the truth about tormenting and harassing Nora's various family members, Thawne mentored Nora on time travel.[10] He urged Nora to travel back in time to the Thinker's Enlightenment and assist in destroying S.T.A.R. Labs' satellites, and thus Orlin Dwyer is now an easier-to-stop version of Cicada.[61] They kept in contact while Nora was in the past through a journal, with Nora sending information to Thawne's cell through Gideon's limited time travel capabilities in regards to information, using the \"time text\" to remain consistent through timeline changes.[18]\n\nAfter Nora returned from a joint mission with Barry where an earlier version of himself combined a piece of Savitar's suit with a device used on Zoom to ultimately disable Cicada's dagger, Nora sent the latest journal entry to Thawne's cell. As Thawne read Nora's entry, the young speedster had arrived in person to confront him about his past actions. He exited Nora's entry and agreed they needed to talk.[18] He commented on how Nora had been gone for a long time. Nora was infuriated with how heartless he was by killing Nora's namesake. Although Thawne expressed remorse for his actions, he also told Nora that his actions indirectly served the greater good, changing not only Barry's destiny, but Nora's as well. He also offered to help Nora in order to pay for his crimes and repair his tarnished legacy, but Nora simply stated that he only cared about himself and bid him farewell before running off. Nora later reappeared again, telling Thawne of wanting to believe there is a good side within Thawne and wants his help. Thawne agreed to help Nora, after which he looks at the countdown, reminding them both that he has little time left.[10]\n\nNora later returns to inform Thawne that Sherloque suspected Nora to be working with someone. Thawne assured Nora that Sherloque had yet to discern the mystery partner's identity, otherwise Barry would travel to 2049 and threaten to phase a hand through Thawne's heart. Nora was more scared of being hated by Barry if the truth came out, so Thawne suggested to distract Sherloque by helping the detective fall in love.[24] After resetting the timeline 52 times to stop Dwyer from killing Team Flash's members, Nora visited Thawne to ask if he was certain that they weren't making things worse. Thawne angrily insisted that he was the only speedster who knew best. Calming himself, he encouraged Nora to stick to their plan, promising they would see Dwyer defeated, Cicada's dagger destroyed and apparently save Barry.[62]\n\nWhen Nora visited once again to inform Thawne that the Meta-human cure is finished and ready to use on Dwyer, in turn, he informed Nora of a newspaper article depicting the last public confrontation between the Flash and Cicada is slowly changing, hinting that something or someone is going to set into motion a new timeline.[63] Thawne's 'fears' were soon proven true as Nora returned to inform him that Team Flash successfully cured Dwyer, but another equivalent of Cicada showed up and took both Dwyer and the dagger. Thawne stated he already knew as evidenced by the unchanged article. He sadly admitted that there was nothing he could do to help and strongly advised Nora to tell the truth to Barry.[49]\n\nAfter Nora'"
