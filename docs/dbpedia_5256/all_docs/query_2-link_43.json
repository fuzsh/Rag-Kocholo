Yes Java Edition Classic 0.0.2aThe version number is now displayed in the top-left corner. Includes the fps and chunk updates. 0.0.23aAdded an option to turn on the debug screen. The current version name is always displayed even when the option is disabled. Java Edition Indev 0.3120100202Added \"E\" entities value, \"P\" particles value, and \"LT\" value. Upon placing chests, the second value of \"LT\" would go up upon every chest placed.The first value seemingly is unaffected by this. 20100206Removed \"LT\" value. FPS and chunk updates have been moved next to the version number and are now contained within parentheses.Moved \"E\" value below \"C\" value, and moved \"P\" value below \"E\" value.\"C\", \"F\", \"O\", \"B\", \"I\", and \"T\" values have been added.\"C\" values cover rendered/total chunks, \"F\" values are chunks outside the field of view, \"O\" values are chunks culled by occlusion culling, \"B\" values are culled entities that are hidden in a chunk and can't be seen, \"I\" values are individually culled entities, and \"T\" values are terrain and lighting data. 20100212-1Added \"L\" lighting updates value. 20100212-2Added Free memory and Allocated memory.

Now only displays when the option is enabled. Java Edition Infdev 20100227-1Removed \"L\" value. \"T\" value no longer displays a value.\"O\", \"E\", \"B\", and \"I\" values no longer function. 20100316\"E\" and \"I\" values now function again. 20100413Added \"All\" and \"Counted\" values. \"All\" displays the total number of loaded entities.\"Counted\" seemingly serves the same function as \"All\". 20100420Removed slash from \"All\" value. Removed \"Counted\" value. 20100624Added second \"E\" value. Second \"E\" is located right next to \"O\" value.Second \"E\" displays number of empty chunk sections which may be skipped due to not yet being loaded and rendered, or has nothing to draw in the current render pass; all render passes are counted.Lagometer added.Separate from debug screen, requires F6 to be held down and can be displayed with the debug screen. 20100627Changed Free memory to Used memory. Now displays MB in parentheses right next to the value percentage. Java Edition Alpha v1.1.1The debug screen is no longer listed as an option and now requires F3 to be held down to activate. v1.2.0?The lagometer is now part of the debug screen. v1.2.3The coordinates have been added to the debug screen. Java Edition Beta 1.3The debug screen, along with other function key controls, has now become a toggle. When the debug screen is open, it now shows numbers above every mob; these numbers being the mob's Entity ID. These numbers are visible through blocks, making F3 a useful mob-finder. 1.7The \"f\" coordinate has been made visible in the debug screen (facing direction). 1.8Pre-releaseThe ability to see the level's seed has been added to the debug screen. Entity numbers being shown above a mob's head have been removed from the debug screen. Some players felt that it was cheating and that it took away from the game. Java Edition 1.0.0October 2, 2011The first images of a runtime performance profiler with a pie chart is revealed. Beta 1.9 Prerelease 3The profiler has been added to the debug screen. 1.2.11.2Information about the biome and light level of the player's location have been added to the debug screen. The seed in multiplayer has been made hidden from the debug screen and now shows as \"0\". 1.2.4Pressing F3 (Fn + F3 on Mac and some laptops) brings up the debug screen, but without the graphs. The graph appears upon pressing ⇧ Shift + F3 (Fn + ⇧ Shift + F3 on Mac and some laptops). 1.3.112w18aInformation about the player's speed and whether the player is touching the ground have added to the debug screen. Coordinates within the debug screen are now rounded to 5 digits. 12w21aInformation about the world's seed has been removed from the debug screen, seen instead by pressing the chat key and typing /seed. The frame time graph has been removed from the debug screen. 12w30aThe y coordinate now shows both the feet level and the eye level. 1.4.212w39aFl, x and z chunk coordinates, and more rotation (f) information have been added to the debug screen. 12w41a⇧ Shift + F3 now shows the profiler graph in the debug screen. F3 + H now shows durability on damaged tools, weapons and armor pieces. 1.4.41.4.3F3 + B now shows the hitbox around entities. At this point, the hitbox is white and opaque and does not have an outline. 1.7.21.7.1F3 + B visual changed. The entity hitbox is now completely transparent, with a thin white outline. 1.814w02aThe debug screen now shows which axis the player is facing after the cardinal direction: \"Toward positive/negative X/Z\". 14w04aThe crosshair in the debug screen now displays 3 short colored lines to indicate the direction of each axis: x/red, y/green, z/blue. The x coordinate line in the debug screen now appears bold when looking east/west, similarly the z coordinate line now appears bold when looking south/north. 14w05aText within the debug screen now has a background. X, y, z, b, bl and other labels within the debug screen have been replaced with more understandable labels.\"Light\" is now the light levels at feet, not eyes. 14w06aX, Y, and Z title in the debug screen has been changed from 'Feet' in the previous snapshot, to 'XYZ'. A day counter, which increases by 1 every dawn, has been added to the debug screen.The debug screen now displays regional difficulty: Peaceful starts at 0.00, Easy starts at 0.75, Normal starts at 1.50, and Hard starts at 2.25.The debug screen now displays player rotation in degrees and quadrants. 14w11aOn the right-hand side of the debug screen, a display now shows up if the player is looking at a block, showing its ID and block states. 14w17aAll blocks now have their info displayed on the right-hand side of the debug screen. The \"Facing negative/positive x/z\" from the debug screen has been removed. 14w20aThe \"Facing negative/positive x/z\" has been readded to the debug screen. 14w25bF3 + B now also shows which direction entities are looking using a blue line. The line on the right-hand side that had displayed the name of the block model the player was looking at has been removed from the debug screen. 14w29aA 'Reduced Debug Info' toggle now exists within multiplayer settings to enable/disable reduced information on the debug screen. The reducedDebugInfo gamerule allows the player to enable/disable reduced information on the debug screen. This overrides all 'reduced debug info' settings in clients. 14w30aThe debug screen now displays how many chunk sections are being rendered currently and how many chunk sections are out of view in percent, the OpenGL version, display size, vendor and GPU. \"Vanilla\" has been added to the version number within the debug screen. 1.8.2pre1The frame time graph within the debug screen has been readded and redesigned, so that it can now be activated using Alt + F3. 1.915w32aF3 + N now toggles between Creative and Spectator modes, when the player is in either of them. The player needs to be allowed to use /gamemode for this to work. 15w43aThe debug screen now shows more information. F3 + Q gives help and shows all F3 + key combinations.F3 + F now increases render distance by 1 (Minimum and Maximum are 2-32).F3 + ⇧ Shift + F now decreases render distance by 1 (Min and Max are 2-32).The debug screen now shows if the pie chart and fps chart are shown on screen.The debug screen now shows text in chat when the player reloads chunks, sounds, etc.The debug screen now does not open when the player uses a specific key combination like F3 + N, F3 + B, etc.F3 + S has been removed from the debug screen, which previously reloaded sounds.F3 + T now reloads all resource pack content, including sounds.Red, blue and green lines have now changed in size within the debug screen and now change relative to the GUI scale.The debug screen is now toggled when the F3 key is released, instead of when it is pressed. 1.1016w20aF3 + G toggles the visible chunk borders around the player. The 3 lines indicating direction now have a small black outline when looking at an area with bad contrast. 1.1318w11aPressing F3 + C now copies the player's current location to the clipboard in the form of a /tp command, though holding for 10 seconds and releasing still forces a debug crash. 18w14aThe debug screen now gives a warning before forcing a debug crash. 18w22cThe debug overlay now shows the fluid the player is looking at, separately from blocks. pre6F3 + I copies block or entity data to the clipboard.
