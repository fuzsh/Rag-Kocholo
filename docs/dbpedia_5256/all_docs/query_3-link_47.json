However, we may earn affiliate revenue on this article and commission when you buy something.\n\nIf you have internet connection, I’m sure you’ve heard about the rise of mob wife aesthetic. In short, it’s a rebellious response to the less-is-more, clean girl movement. Now, before you go all Carmela Soprano with piles of jewelry and unapologetic fur coats and animal prints, there are a few tips to ensure those femme fatale outfits feel a bit more elevated and less chaotic.\n\nNaturally, celebs like Kendall Jenner, Rihanna, and Irina Shayk are on the list of early adopters, showing us exactly how it’s done. In Paris during Couture Fashion Week, Rih delivered an elegant, edgy take by cinching a Saint Laurent leather scarf with a gold cuff around her neck. The toughness of the leather was balanced by the soft draping—a key styling trick to keep in mind when channeling the exotic—often times unhinged—glamour of the mob wife aesthetic.\n\nWe can always count on Rih Rih to take everything she does to the next level, and she even went full retro with blonde side-swooped tresses and voluminous height that defied gravity. But if you’re looking for hairstyle inspiration too, a perfectly undone messy updo is the effortless way to go and Jasmine Tookes nails it in the photo below.\n\nAhead, we’ve gathered three ways to dip your toe (or should I say your red acrylic full set) into the pool of the mob wife movement with ease.\n\nInstead of a Low-Key Stole, Go All Out With Fluffy Coats\n\nWhile in Aspen, Jenner showed us how to master the mob wife aesthetic while wearing a brushed shearling Phoebe Philo coat. For added elegance, finish the look with sheer tights and kitten heels.\n\nInstead of understated sparkles…drip in gold\n\nOf course, diamonds are forever, but the appeal of chunky gold earrings adds a retro twist that feels classier than ever to any outfit. Take notes from Tookes and finish your look with a tousled updo and mysterious smokey eye makeup.\n\nInstead of Head-to-Toe Animal Print, Try Subtle Splashes of Leopard\n\nJoyfully chaotic animal prints can sometimes feel overwhelming, so ease them into your outfits in small doses, à la Irina Shayk."
