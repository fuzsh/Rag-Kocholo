        "meta_description": "9-year-old Brian (Rowen Smyth) has a supernatural encounter with God, an experience that sends him on an adventurous quest to “find out more about what Christians believe”. He faces heavy opposition from the world around him especially his own father Simon (Matt Lindquist), an atheist TV newscaster. Brian finds allies in the pastor of a local church (Wilford Brimley) and a wounded U.S. Marine (Jeremy London). Brian’s pure and innocent faith brings about manifestations of God’s extraordinary power that quickly become breaking news. Don't miss out on this miracle packed adventure!",

        "text": "I Believe is a story about using childlike faith, which can result in great blessings—sometimes even miracles. Brian is a little boy, very intelligent, who grew up in a non-Christian home, but as he writes a paper in school about the pilgrims, he learns of their faith. His parents discourage him from pursuing the Christian faith, but Brian is very interested in learning more. His father even tells him not to read the Bible, but he persists in seeking God.\n\nBrian believes in God’s word, and prays for a veteran who is missing one leg. In addition, Brian sends a woman home to pray for her blind baby. A news reporter attempts to make a mockery out of Brian’s faith; subsequently, Brian’s family faces severe tests and trials. Brian is kidnapped by the mob, but this leads to one of the greatest miracles of all, especially for Brian’s family. This wonderful film focuses on faith and making a stand for God’s word. We are pleased to award our Faith-Friendly Seal for All ages this inspiring movie, however this film is not intended for very young children. This movie proves that childlike faith brings about great results!"
