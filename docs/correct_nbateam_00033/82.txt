A report by Yahoo! Sports has Shawn Marion being traded to the Dallas Mavericks in exchange for Jerry Stackhouse in a rare four-team NBA trade.

Stackhouse would go Toronto, then Memphis, where he will be bought out and become an unrestricted free agent.

It is a sign-and-trade for Marion who picks up a five-year deal worth $35-$40 million from the Mavs, who boast an aging but still great starting five.

Marion will join Dirk Nowitzki, Jason Kidd, Josh Howard, and potentially Marcin Gortat, who recently signed an offer sheet with Dallas that Orlando is not expected to match. Last year’s Sixth Man of the Year Jason Terry will likely resume his role coming off the Mavericks' bench.

Although the league has not approved the trade, the deal is expected to include Dallas sending Stackhouse to Toronto, money to Memphis to help buyout Stackhouse’s contract, Antoine Wright and Devean George going to Toronto, Kris Humphries joining Marion in Dallas, and Orlando sending Hedo Turkoglu to the Raptors in exchange for a sizeable trade exception.

I told you it was complicated.

Dallas gets Marion and Humphries.

Toronto gets Wright, George, and Turkoglu.

Memphis gets money.

Orlando acquires a trade exception.

Toronto desperately needed help at SF this off-season, as they were expected to, and did lose Marion and Anthony Parker (expected to sign with Cleveland) to free agency.

The Raptors drafted DeMar DeRozan and now potentially have Wright, George, and Turkoglu, who are all capable of playing SF for the Raptors.

Good work by GM Bryan Colangelo.
