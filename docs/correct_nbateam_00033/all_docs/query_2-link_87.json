        "text": "DALLAS (105.3 THE FAN) -- Former Dallas Mavericks forward Shawn Marion has been a staple with the team over the past five seasons, contributing heavily during the team's NBA Championship run in 2011.\n\nBut the 4-time NBA All Star signed with Cleveland this offseason, where he will team up with LeBron James in search of another ring.\n\n\"It was tough,\" said Marion with Shan & RJ on 105.3 The Fan. \"It was up in the air. I was contemplating a lot of different things, but I felt like I really wanted to pursue another championship and I felt like this is the best way for me to do that.\"\n\nThe Cavs are considered the heavy favorites in the weaker Eastern Conference, particularly with Kevin Love joining the young core and James in Cleveland.\n\nMarion welcomed the birth of his first son in April. His son, Shawn David Marion, will be living in Chicago, which also factored into his decision to relocate to Ohio.\n\n\"It wasn't about the money. I got offered more money from different teams. It's with just a matter of what I'm comfortable with. And also, from Cleveland to Chicago is not that far. It's driveable and a quick flight.\"\n\nMarion plans to make Dallas his permanent home, and says there are no hard feelings towards the organization and owner Mark Cuban. Cuban acquired Marion via trade in 2009.\n\n\"We still talk. We've been friends for a longtime. Prior to me coming to Dallas and being a player -- that's my guy.\"\n\nMarion believes that Dallas is a deep, solid team heading into 2014, saying \"anything is possible\" and wishing them luck.\n\nBut the idea of playing alongside James and Love in Cleveland...\n\n\"It's going to be fun. We've got a chance to do something special. It's going to be fun.\"\n\nFull Court Press Album\n\nMarion is collaborating with a number of athletes -- along with T-Pain, Dorrough and Young Cash -- to create \"a clean, motivational\" hip hop record.\n\nIn one single, \"I'm A Champion\", Marion salutes the Mavericks and the city of Dallas.\n\nHere's a preview:\n\n(Â©2014 CBS Local Media, a division of CBS Radio Inc.
