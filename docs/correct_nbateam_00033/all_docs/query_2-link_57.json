        "text": "Kevin Durant shot 36 percent from the floor and committed 10 turnovers during the Thunder’s two losses to the Mavs in Oklahoma City. What did Shawn Marion do to disrupt Durant’s rhythm? Well, Durant points out that Marion is getting a whole lot of help. “I’m not playing one-on-one,” Durant said. “I could see if he was totally locking me up and I would get in the post and he would block my shots and steal the ball, but I’m not playing one-on-one. “Every time I get the ball, it’s one-on-two, one-on-three. And as you know as a little kid, you can’t play like that. So I’m passing the basketball and trying to find open spots. He’s a good defender, but, sorry, it’s not just him.”\n\nDallas Mavericks star Shawn Marion is gonna be busy next month — because we’re told, he’s shooting a pilot for a reality TV show … right around the same time the Mavs crush Miami in the NBA finals (if there is a God). It’s tentatively called “The Ladies in My Life” — and big surprise … it’s all about Shawn and the important women in his day-to-day … including his mom, sisters, publicist … and his endless stream of lovers. One of the featured family members is Shawn’s twin sister Shawnett — who’s 6-feet tall and can DUNK a basketball!!\n\nMarion’s teammates and coaches mercilessly criticized him during film sessions the last couple of days. They wouldn’t accept his lack of aggression in the first two games of this series, when Dallas had by far its worst defensive performances of the postseason. The Matrix’s response: He embraced the challenge. Unlike the last two games, Marion was the aggressor from the get-go.Marion was the main man in the Mavs’ defense of Kevin Durant, who made only seven of 22 shots from the floor and went 0-of-8 from 3-point range during a horribly inefficient 24-point performance. He set the tone for Dallas returning to the in-your-grill defensive style it had during the first two rounds, when the Portland Trail Blazers and Los Angeles Lakers failed to crack triple digits in any game.\n\nOKC started the contest 1 for 7 from the field, went 4 for 17 in the first period and continued to shoot less than 30 percent for the game until 2:51 remained in the third quarter. “We wanted to make sure they felt our presence out there,” said Mavs forward Shawn Marion, who tied for team-high honors with 18 points. “Every time they got a shot, somebody was in their face. That’s the defense we’ve been playing all playoffs.” OKC finished 1 for 17 from 3-point range, with Russell Westbrook making the team’s final attempt of the game. That’s the worst 3-point performance in the playoffs since the Mavericks went 1 for 18 against Phoenix in 2005. “They had several opportunities … and it didn’t fall,” Mavs sixth man Jason Terry said. “It happens like that in basketball. Good thing we had the lead to hold them off.”"
