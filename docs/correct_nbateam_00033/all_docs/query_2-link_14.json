        "text": "Phoenix Suns legend Shawn Marion has a big night ahead of him- he will officially have his number 31 jersey retired in a post game ceremony to cap off a contest with the New York Knicks.\n\nMarion, the number nine pick in the 1999 NBA draft out of UNLV, played for the franchise from 1999-2008, and was a central figure of one of the most entertaining teams in basketball history.\n\nKnown for his unorthodox shooting form, defensive versatility, and game-breaking athleticism, Marion was a fan-favorite from day one prior to his eventual displeasure with former Suns governor Robert Sarver and exit in a trade that brought Shaquille O'Neal to Phoenix in February 2008.\n\nThe Suns worked quickly to repair the fractured relationship with Marion quickly after Mat Ishbia took control of the franchise. Now, Suns fans can remember and reminisce over the good times exclusively.\n\nHere are some of the most memorable parts of Marion's tenure with Phoenix:\n\n2004-05: All-NBA Selection\n\nMarion started all 81 games he played in, a season in which Phoenix went 62-20 in. Marion also was a two-time player of the week selection, was selected an all-star for the second time, and got an all-NBA third team selection to cap off an incredible season.\n\nMarion was also the only player in the 2004-05 season to place in the top 25 in points, rebounds, steals, blocks and minutes across the entire season.\n\nHe also joined David Robinson as the second player in league history to place top five in both steals and rebounds in the same season (steals began being tracked in 1973).\n\nHe also lead the Suns to the Western Conference Finals - a series in which Phoenix fell to the San Antonio Spurs in five games.\n\nMay 20, 2005: 38 Points to Send Suns to WCF\n\nThis is quite possibly the single most memorable moment for Marion in a Suns uniform.\n\nThe Suns, missing sharpshooter Joe Johnson due to injury, leaned heavily on the efforts of Marion and Steve Nash.\n\nBoth delivered in incredible fashion.\n\nMarion scored 38 points, grabbed 16 rebounds, hit four three-pointers, and most importantly helped the Suns shed a seven-point fourth quarter deficit to win the game in overtime.\n\nThe Suns obviously came up short of winning a title, but this was a particular game that showed how much #31 meant to the franchise and city.\n\nFebruary 22, 2006: Career-High Scoring Night\n\nThe Matrix was truly in control of this game, a night where Phoenix weathered a 2-for-13 night from Steve Nash to beat a bad Boston Celtics team 103-94.\n\nMarion boasted a stat line of 44 points (a career-high) to go along 15 rebounds, 4 steals and 3 blocks.\n\nThis was a year in which Amar'e Stoudemire missed virtually the entire season due to a knee injury, and Marion was the key catalyst in Phoenix managing to win 54 games anyways.\n\nThis is just another specific showing of the degree to which Marion could truly impact any given game.\n\nFebruary 25, 2006: 30 Point, 20 Rebound Effort\n\nMarion had another massive night just three days after his career high scoring night, becoming the first Sun to record a 30-point, 20-rebound game since Charles Barkley in a win against the Charlotte Bobcats.\n\nMarion scored 31 points and grabbed a career-best 24 rebounds that night- and etched himself alongside a former Sun that won an NBA MVP in the process.\n\nMay 16, 2006: 36 Points to Put Suns Up 3-2 in WC Semis\n\nPhoenix went into game five of their Western Conference Semifinals series against the Los Angeles Clippers tied 2-2 in unexpected fashion.\n\nMarion delivered and then some, playing 54:37 of a possible 58 minutes in a game that went into double overtime.\n\nThe Matrix had yet another vintage performance, dropping 36 points and grabbing 20 boards in a 124-118 Suns win.\n\n2006-07: DPOY Candidacy, 10K Career Points\n\nThis was the last full season for Marion in the Valley, and it was a memorable one.\n\nMarion reached 10,000 career points in the Suns' opening season game against the Los Angeles Lakers on October 31. He also spent much of the year in the defensive player of the year race, leading the league in steals at 156 for good measure.\n\nWhile the Matrix didn't win the award, he finished fourth, received seven first-place votes, and was once again selected as an all-star.\n\nThe Suns faced yet another untimely exit, losing to the Spurs once again in a six-game series, and it was the beginning of the end of one of the most exciting brands of basketball ever seen on a court.\n\nSuns fans should look back at these times with fondness. Marion is undoubtedly one of the most iconic players in a long line of Suns' greats.\n\nHere's to hoping tonight is a great night- both on the court and in the post-game ceremony."
