        "text": "Shawn Marion\n\nDrafted by:\n\nPhoenix, Round 1, pick 9.\n\nEXPERT ANALYSIS\n\n\"Shawn Marion is a 6-7 athlete who runs the floor and finishes with spectacular flair. He is a great transition player that has tremendous potential on the defensive end and can run with speed and stamina.\n\nAlthough he is an accomplished scorer, Marion is not a great shooter. He struggles with his range and consistency, and has some difficulty hitting the pull-up jumper. Marion is best along the baseline, where he can attack the basket and crash the offensive boards. He needs to improve upon his ballhandling and passing skills.\n\nWhile he has the size to see the entire floor, Marion does not yet know the game and does not make good decisions all the time. Marion is big and strong for a small forward, and needs to add ball skills and shooting consistency to his tremendous athletic potential.\"\n\n-- ESPN's Jay Bilas\n\nCollege: UNLV Height: 6-7\n\nWeight: 215 pounds\n\nPosition: Forward\n\nAge: 21 (May 7, 1978)\n\nBirthplace: North Chicago, Ill.\n\nCareer highlights\n\nEarly-entry candidate for 1999 NBA draft\n\nPlayed two seasons for coach Dan Sparks at Vincennes University (junior college) and is school's all-time scoring leader\n\nTwo-time recipient of the Allen L.
