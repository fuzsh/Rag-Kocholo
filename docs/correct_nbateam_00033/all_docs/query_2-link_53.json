        "text": "Marion is hands-on in everything he does, including the design of all his homes. With his Dallas home, he approved every accessory, fabric, and finish.\n\nIn the living room, Marion's taste for neutral, sleek interiors is reflected in the house's organic color palette, the use of metals such as stainless steel.\n\nAll of the art in the house was commissioned and carried out by Dallas painter and sculptor Doug Van Voorhis. Because the furniture and fabric were muted, the art could pop with color, explains Wyll.\n\nThe Softer Side of Modern\n\nThe Matrix's design influences? Some of the most stylish hotels in the country where he's spent many nights on the road and the multimillion dollar modernist cribs that belong to teammates and friends. \"A lot of contemporary homes and hotels are not livable,\" says Marion, who names the W Hotels as one of his favorites. \"I've been in places that were beautiful, but dude, you don't want to touch nothing, and you don't know what's what, or what's where, because everything is hidden in the walls. You can't find anything. I didn't want that. You gotta have that home feel.\"\n\nThe massive dining room allowed for large-scale custom pieces such as a 13-foot buffet and 12-foot table, both custom made of ribbon sapele mahogany by William & Wesley Co. Chairs are by Brueton and Beacon Hill. The cut crystal obelisks are by Dallas artist Kathleen Allen of Verita.\n\nWhen Marion's home in between games, you'll likely find him hanging out in the kitchen grilling fish or turkey burgers for friends. Those gleaming cabinets are made from African macassar ebony.\n\nNBA-Size Luxury\n\nFor Marion, that \"home feel\" means comfort. And for a guy who's 6' 7\" and 228 lbs., comfort means custom made. All of the furniture in his house was built by Dallas-based William & Wesley Co., not only to fit Marion's NBA-sized frame but to accommodate the luxurious scale of the house with its 32-foot ceilings. Chairs and sofas were made deeper than normal and a cast bronze bed was commissioned with an extra large mattress that took months to make. All of the paintings and sculptures in the house, many of them colorful, were custom made by Dallas artist Doug Van Voorhis.\n\nMarion's bed is custom made from cast bronze. Because he's too tall to fit comfortably in a king sized mattress, an extra-large custom one was made.\n\nCustom-Made Crib\n\n\"We did a limited number of really good furniture pieces so that everything stands out,\" says Wyll, who used materials such as stainless steel and exotic woods such as sapele mahogany, with some of the furnishings accented in silver leaf. Mohair and leather upholstery in Marion's favorite colors -- brown, taupe, and black -- keep it all soft and luxurious.\n\nBespoke is definitely better, Marion attests. \"I didn't want anything you can go into a store and grab. You won't see anything in my house anywhere else.. There's a higher markup when you get things made, but you gotta do it right,\" he says, then starts laughing. \"The highest markups I pay are on furniture and alcohol.\"\n\nA favorite decor item, Marion bought this silver-plated jewelry box skull online.\n\nThe master bath is done in light Emperador and Carrara marbles."
