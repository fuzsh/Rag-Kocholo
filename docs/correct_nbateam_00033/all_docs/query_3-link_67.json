        "text": "Earlier this year, the NBA released its list of the 75 greatest players in league history, and it caused quite the stir.\n\nFormer NBA All-Star Shawn Marion recently joined the large group of people who have an issue with the list. The 43-year-old, who was not included on the list, feels that he should have been included.\n\n“I feel like I should have been top 75,” Marion said. “… I didn’t get the attention everybody else got, but I’ll tell you what: My numbers don’t lie, though. So, when you go back and look at it, you like, ‘Damn, damn, did he really do that at 6’7″?’ … The things I did ain’t normal.”\n\nMarion finished his playing career with averages of 15.2 points, 8.7 rebounds and 1.9 assists per game. He knocked down 48.4 percent of his shots from the field and 33.1 percent of his shots from beyond the arc.\n\nHe earned four All-Star selections during his playing days and accomplished the ultimate goal of winning an NBA title in 2011. He won that title with the Dallas Mavericks.\n\nOriginally a first-round pick in the 1999 NBA Draft, Marion ended up spending 16 years in the league. He played for five different teams, but the majority of his years in the association came with the Phoenix Suns, who drafted him.\n\nHe certainly had a career worth celebrating, but it apparently wasn’t enough for him to land on the NBA’s list of its 75 greatest players. Still, he’ll always be able to say that he won a championship and accomplished a lot throughout his lengthy career."
