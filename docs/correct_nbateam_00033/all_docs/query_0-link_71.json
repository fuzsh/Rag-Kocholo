        "text": "Cleveland Cavaliers forward Shawn Marion is calling it quits. According to Paul Coro of the Arizona Republic, the man famously known as “The Matrix” plans to retire at the end of the season. He cited being away from his 8-month-old son as one of his main reasons to finally say goodbye to professional basketball.\n\nIn speaking with Coro, Marion explained,\n\n“I wanted to go out on my own terms. The biggest thing is having a son. I got attached to him. Seeing him periodically is hard. Watching him grow up on pictures and videos is hard.”\n\nMarion considered hanging it up prior to this season, but instead opted to team up with the greatest player on the planet, LeBron James, and chase one last ring.\n\nThe UNLV product was drafted ninth overall by the Phoenix Suns in 1999 and has gone on to have a long, illustrious career with the Suns, Miami Heat, Toronto Raptors, Dallas Mavericks and Cavaliers. In 15 seasons, Marion has racked up over 17,500 points and 10,000 rebounds, and has established himself as one of the league’s premier defenders.\n\n“It’s been a great ride.” Marion said, reminiscing of the past 16 years. “I went from being a high flier to shooting three’s to being a slasher to all kinds of things to win. I had to reform myself.”\n\nJust last month he became the first player in NBA history to record 15,000 points, 10,000 rebounds, 1,000 blocks and 500 made three-point field goals.\n\nIt has been an up-and-down season so far for “The Matrix,” but regardless of the final outcome, Marion will have accomplished what he set out to do. After being drafted, he stated he hoped to play in the NBA for 15 years."
