        "text": "Centre O'Neal, forward Jamario Moon and a conditional draft pick were exchanged for four-times All-Star Marion, guard Marcus Banks and cash from the Heat.\n\n\"I am obviously very familiar with Shawn (pictured on the right) on both a personal and professional level and feel he will ideally complement our roster and benefit our team in a significant way,\" Raptors General Manager Bryan Colangelo said.\n\n\"As far as his pending free-agent status, this is not a move intended to clear space or predetermine a next move. It will, however, provide flexibility to both Shawn and the Raptors.\n\nNBA\n\nPierce leads Celtics fightback\n\n13/02/2009 at 08:05\n\n\"Marcus will add scoring and defensive punch to our lineup and should benefit from the change of address. This is a win-win for both Toronto and Miami and we wish JO and Jamario the best.\"\n\nMarion, 30, has averaged 17.9 points, 10.0 rebounds and 1.9 steals in 717 regular season games over the last decade with the Phoenix Suns and Miami.\n\nThe 30-year-old O'Neal, who joined the Raptors from the Indiana Pacers in July, was averaging 13.5 points and 7.0 rebounds in an injury-plagued first season in Toronto."
