        "text": "When I wrote about Steve Nash’s pair of somewhat controversial MVP selections last week, I held up the decline of Shawn Marion’s game after leaving Phoenix as an example of the way Nash helped his teammates put up offensive numbers that were beyond their “true” ability level. However, a reader was quick to point out that while Nash had an effect on Marion, the inverse was also true, and that Marion’s decline was probably due more to age, injuries, and 2 different teams than Nash’s absence.\n\nSo today I decided to use Roland Beech’s great stats at 82games.com to take a closer look at Marion’s numbers with and without Nash to try and show even more clearly how much he benefited from the terrific synergy they developed together in Phoenix.\n\n2004\n\n2003-04 was Nash’s last year in Dallas; Stephon Marbury and Leandro Barbosa were the PGs of note alongside Marion for Phoenix.\n\nAge Tm G Min ORtg %Pos Floor% T/Min %Pass %Shoot %Fouled %TO 25 PHO 79 3217 106.5 22.2 0.495 0.90 42 45 8 5 P/36 2P% 3P% FT% TS% %Astd %FGA AsR ToR PPR FTr 3Ptd OR% 16.3 46.5 34.0 85.1 51.3 60.0% 24.7% 11.7 11.3 -0.41 20.0 19.8 7.5\n\nShot Att. eFG% Ast’d Blk’d Pts Jump 70% .404 61% 3% 9.5 Close 20% .548 52% 8% 3.6 Dunk 8% .951 80% 1% 2.5 Tips 3% .450 0% 0% 0.5 Inside 30% .640 59% 6% 6.6\n\n2005\n\nThis was Nash’s first year as Marion’s point guard; the two played 2266 minutes together and were one of the league’s top player pairs at +14 pts/100 of efficiency while on the court together.\n\nAge Tm G Min ORtg %Pos Floor% T/Min %Pass %Shoot %Fouled %TO 26 PHO 81 3146 116.2 20.6 0.532 0.77 36 51 9 5 P/36 2P% 3P% FT% TS% %Astd %FGA AsR ToR PPR FTr 3Ptd OR% 17.0 52.6 33.4 83.3 55.6 73.0% 23.1% 7.5 9.7 -0.71 21.3 26.5 8.4\n\nShot Att. eFG% Ast’d Blk’d Pts Jump 64% .438 75% 3% 8.9 Close 22% .552 70% 9% 3.8 Dunk 12% .935 80% 1% 3.5 Tips 3% .361 0% 0% 0.3 Inside 36% .662 72% 6% 7.7\n\n2006\n\nIn ’06, Nash won his 2nd consecutive MVP award and Marion set a career high with 15.4 Win Shares.\n\nAge Tm G Min ORtg %Pos Floor% T/Min %Pass %Shoot %Fouled %TO 27 PHO 81 3263 118.1 21.3 0.551 0.77 32 51 12 5 P/36 2P% 3P% FT% TS% %Astd %FGA AsR ToR PPR FTr 3Ptd OR% 18.4 57.7 33.1 80.9 59.1 76.0% 23.3% 6.8 9.0 -0.91 21.8 21.2 8.7\n\nShot Att. eFG% Ast’d Blk’d Pts Jump 60% .433 80% 3% 8.7 Close 22% .663 71% 10% 5.0 Dunk 15% .922 84% 0% 4.7 Tips 3% .487 0% 0% 0.5 Inside 40% .748 74% 6% 10.1\n\n2007\n\nAnother strong year for Marion, although he began expressing more and more displeasure about the fact that Nash and (especially) Amare Stoudemire received more credit for the Suns’ accomplishments than he did.\n\nAge Tm G Min ORtg %Pos Floor% T/Min %Pass %Shoot %Fouled %TO 28 PHO 80 3010 117.6 18.5 0.547 0.71 36 48 11 5 P/36 2P% 3P% FT% TS% %Astd %FGA AsR ToR PPR FTr 3Ptd OR% 16.1 58.7 31.7 81.0 59.4 78.0% 20.7% 6.7 10.2 -0.82 23.2 23.5 7.0\n\nShot Att. eFG% Ast’d Blk’d Pts Jump 57% .442 74% 3% 6.7 Close 24% .605 77% 8% 3.9 Dunk 17% .923 88% 2% 4.2 Tips 2% .318 0% 5% 0.2 Inside 43% .717 81% 5% 8.3\n\n2008: Suns\n\nUnhappy about his contract and his perceived role on the team, Marion finally requested a trade at midseason & was shipped to Miami for Shaquille O’Neal.\n\nAge Tm G Min ORtg %Pos Floor% T/Min %Pass %Shoot %Fouled %TO 29 PHO 47 1713 119.0 16.8 0.550 0.73 44 45 7 4 P/36 2P% 3P% FT% TS% %Astd %FGA AsR ToR PPR FTr 3Ptd OR% 14.9 59.9 34.7 71.3 59.4 85.0% 19.7% 8.4 8.4 0.95 18.7 28.9 6.2\n\nShot Att. eFG% Ast’d Blk’d Pts Jump 50% .471 86% 2% 5.8 Close 28% .537 90% 12% 3.7 Dunk 20% .920 84% 3% 4.4 Tips 2% .455 0% 0% 0.2 Inside 50% .684 84% 8% 8.4\n\n2008: Heat\n\nUpon going to the Heat, Marion’s numbers slipped precipitously — he went from 11.9 WS/3K in Phoenix to merely 4.4 in Miami.\n\nAge Tm G Min ORtg %Pos Floor% T/Min %Pass %Shoot %Fouled %TO 29 MIA 16 602 99.3 21.2 0.479 0.88 45 40 7 7 P/36 2P% 3P% FT% TS% %Astd %FGA AsR ToR PPR FTr 3Ptd OR% 14.0 49.4 25.8 69.0 50.3 69.0% 21.7% 12.1 15.5 -1.72 20.1 14.8 9.8\n\nShot Att. eFG% Ast’d Blk’d Pts Jump 51% .355 74% 4% 5.1 Close 29% .475 66% 16% 3.9 Dunk 14% .867 85% 3% 3.5 Tips 5% .636 0% 0% 0.9 Inside 49% .608 66% 11% 8.3\n\n2009: Heat\n\nIn his second half-season with Miami, Marion became more passive than ever on offense, and was dealt at the deadline to Toronto.\n\nAge Tm G Min ORtg %Pos Floor% T/Min %Pass %Shoot %Fouled %TO 30 MIA 42 1516 108.8 16.9 0.526 0.69 44 43 7 5 P/36 2P% 3P% FT% TS% %Astd %FGA AsR ToR PPR FTr 3Ptd OR% 12.2 51.0 20.0 78.8 52.2 67.0% 17.7% 8.2 11.7 -0.31 19.1 9.0 8.4\n\nShot Att. eFG% Ast’d Blk’d Pts Jump 54% .386 64% 3% 4.4 Close 26% .517 72% 10% 2.9 Dunk 14% .887 80% 2% 2.6 Tips 6% .400 0% 0% 0.5 Inside 46% .615 70% 6% 6.0\n\n2009: Raptors\n\nAcquired mainly for monetary reasons, Marion played out the string as a mere shadow of the player he’d been in Phoenix.\n\nAge Tm G Min ORtg %Pos Floor% T/Min %Pass %Shoot %Fouled %TO 30 TOR 27 954 105.4 20.2 0.514 0.85 45 42 7 6 P/36 2P% 3P% FT% TS% %Asth %FGA AsR ToR PPR FTr 3Pth OR% 14.5 50.2 15.4 80.6 52.3 64.0% 21.3% 11.1 13.2 -0.73 18.1 3.8 9.1\n\nShot Att. eFG% Ast’d Blk’d Pts Jump 44% .315 57% 6% 3.5 Close 42% .559 66% 7% 5.9 Dunk 11% .919 82% 8% 2.5 Tips 4% .538 0% 0% 0.5 Inside 56% .627 67% 7% 9.0\n\nSo, what do we learn about the Nash-Marion relationship from these numbers? Look at the % of made field goals by the Matrix that were assisted, before, during, and after his days alongside Nash:\n\nWithout Nash, Marion doesn’t enjoy anywhere near as much of the benefit of being set up for his baskets, even when playing 454 minutes alongside Jose Calderon, a passer almost on the same level as Nash. And he cannot operate on the same level of efficiency without those high assist rates: look at the precipitous decline in his offensive rating as he left Phoenix for supposedly greener pastures. It’s no coincidence that he peaked at 119 pts/100 possessions when he was assisted on a career-best 85% of his field goals.\n\nIn fact, we can even see this in action when we plot his eFG% vs. his %Ast’d:"
