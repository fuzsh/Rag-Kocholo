        "text": "Former Phoenix Suns star Shawn Marion became a first-time nominee for the Naismith Hall of Fame this past year.\n\nDespite failing to earn induction for the 2020 class, the 6-foot-7 forward is almost certain his day will come.\n\n\"I think the legacy I left for the game is there,\" Marion told The Athletic's Michael Lee. \"But who is it to decide? Who is making the decisions? What do they base it off of? If you look at all the numbers, to me, I should be a shoo-in. Should I not?\n\n\"What am I supposed to do? What am I not supposed to do? It's out of my control. I know it's a political thing. It's a lot more other stuff going on. But certain things, you earn that. I earned that.\"\n\nMarion shined for parts of nine seasons with the infamous \"Seven Seconds or Less\" Suns of the mid-2000s. He earned four All-Star selections and was named to the All-NBA third team twice during his time in the desert.\n\nSurprisingly, Marion was never named to an NBA All-Defensive team, but he was ahead of his time as a small-ball power forward with the ability to guard multiple positions.\n\n\"I'm a big (reason) why the game is what it is today,\" Marion said. \"And I can walk out of my house and hold my head held high and talk about this game, because I know what I was able to do on this floor. What I was able to do is the model of what everybody is trying to do right now.\"\n\nMarion, who was selected ninth overall by Phoenix in 1999, averaged 18.4 points, 10 boards, and 1.9 steals across 660 appearances for the Suns. He also spent five seasons with the Dallas Mavericks, where he won his lone title in 2011.\n\nThe UNLV product is the only player in NBA history to finish their career with at least 17,000 points, 10,000 boards, 1,500 steals, 1,000 blocks, and 500 triples."
