        "text": "Given their cap restrictions, the Cavs will likely target experienced players who are willing to take less money for a chance to win, just as Amar’e Stoudemire and David West did with Miami and San Antonio respectively. It’s the same method the Cavs used last off-season when acquiring Shawn Marion and Kendrick Perkins. With Williams in the mix and the possibility of re-signing both Matthew Dellavedova and J.R. Smith, the Cavs will likely search for another wing to backup LeBron James as well as provide overall depth on the perimeter. Adding a difference maker, however, appears improbable.\n\nShawn Marion FINALLY unloaded his Miami condo … the one he was so desperate to sell, he once offered up Super Bowl tickets to any takers! The former NBA champ closed the deal on the massive, 7,373 sq. ft pad, which features six bedrooms and seven baths. It’s located in a super exclusive Coconut Grove gated community. Marion lost money on the deal — he sold it for $1.8 million after buying it in 2008 for just under $2.5 million."
