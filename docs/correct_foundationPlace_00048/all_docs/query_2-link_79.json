Dave -----Original Message----- From: tycho-dev-bounces@xxxxxxxxxxx [mailto:tycho-dev-bounces@xxxxxxxxxxx] On Behalf Of Igor Fedorenko Sent: Wednesday, 13 April 2011 7:59 AM To: tycho-dev@xxxxxxxxxxx Subject: Re: [tycho-dev] tycho-p2-extras, 0.11.0 release? I staged tycho-extras 0.11.0 and staging repo is available from [1]. I also created tycho-extras-0.11.x branch for 0.11.0 release work and updated master to use 0.12.0-SNAPSHOT version. Also, why emma and p2-extras plugins use groupId=org.sonatype.tycho? I think org.sonatype.tycho.extras is more appropriate in this case. What do you think?
