        "text": "No Arguing Over the Bill\n\n2nd August 2002 (NISER)\n\nBy Gopal Nair\n\nIntec Telecom Systems, a global leader in Operations Support Systems (OSS) for fixed, mobile and IP/next-generation networks, announced that Swisscom Mobile, Switzerland's leading provider in the Swiss mobile communications market, has begun operation with its InterconnecT intercarrier billing solution.\n\nWith the help of Intec's implementation team, Swisscom Mobile successfully configured and installed the InterconnecT solution, generating highly accurate interconnect bills in its first run. Swisscom uses InterconnecT, the world leader in domestic and international intercarrier billing, to charge other carriers for using its network facilities. Intec's InterconnecT PREP pre-mediation technology has also been installed as a front end to the billing system.\n\n\"Thanks to Intec's experience and professional support we were able to get the system up and running according to our time plan,\" said Kurt Schmid, head of Network Strategy at Swisscom Mobile. \"Intec's solution is a standard, off-the-shelf mature product that can be installed relatively quickly. The revenue generated by our billing solution will be used to help finance our expanding portfolio of services.\"\n\nInterconnecT will support Swisscom Mobile's forecast growth in the GSM market by maximising network revenues and minimising costs. The solution will enable the company to achieve a strategic commercial advantage by accurately billing and auditing the interconnect charges that make up a large portion of any mobile operator's revenues and cost base."
