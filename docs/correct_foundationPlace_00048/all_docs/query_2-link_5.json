        "text": "The Information & Communication Technologies (ICT) world has undergone significant change over the past five years due to the increasing convergence of mobile, telco and I.T. technologies.\n\nWe can deliver technology that keeps up with the evolving digital landscape and help companies deploy solutions to compete more effectively. The future looks bright for our network as we continue to revolutionise specialist support services for SMEs.\n\nWe help partners become full-service technology solutions providers.\n\n​Our acquisition model stands out in the market. In all cases, we acquire a controlling interest but the partners management remain the same. We see this as a very important element in ensuring that customers immediately have trust and confidence in exploring technology solutions.\n\nOur route to market differentiates us from other consultancies in the technology sector and makes a compelling proposition for investors. We work with SMEs offering fully scalable digital technology solutions that can grow with their businesses.​\n\nWe give our partners the ability to offer technology solutions and consulting services to their customers immediately, without having to invest their time and resources into building the necessary skill sets in house.\n\n​We share GP generated from services we provide to their customers and inevitably uncover further opportunities for them.\n\nThe partnership is a 2-way benefit. Our partners get access to the technology skills, consulting resources and full back office support necessary to grow their businesses (including Finance, Customer Relationship Management, Marketing, Billing, Leasing, HR) and we gain a loyal customer base that has been developed and nurtured over several years.\n\nIn 2018, we received investment from Maven Equity Finance/The Northern Powerhouse Investment Fund* allowing us to scale our network following the acquisition of Hale Communications and fuel a recruitment drive to further strengthen our team. In May 2019, we successfully secured £4m in growth capital funding from BOOST&Co. In August 2019 we added Cheshire Business Services to our expanding portfolio, followed by Titan Networks in November 2019. In March 2020, we welcomed iTek Computer Solutions to our group whilst RivaNET™ joined the inTEC GROUP in October 2020.​\n\nIn July 2021 we entered into a £20 million facility agreement with Duke Royalty, allowing us to finance out our existing funders and provide additional capital for future acquisitions. We have subsequently acquired Miller Waite in September 2021, Provident IT and Firefly Enterprises in January 2022, Opal IT in February 2022 and Astec Computing in April 2022. In February 2023, we acquired Frog IT Services Ltd and Sweethaven in July 2023."
