        "text": "Our philosophy is based on the conviction that innovative engineering in plant technology requires a commitment to quality and sustainability. With our production in Germany, we stand for this basic claim every day.\n\nOur systems are installed worldwide and, as “made in Germany”, stand for highly efficient, long-lasting systems with environmentally friendly technologies. With our innovative technologies, we develop renewable energy sources and generate energy and process heat from waste.\n\nWe ensure the quality of our products with continuous data analysis. Preventive maintenance and care of the systems maximize availability while minimizing costs. We can identify potential dangers at an early stage and incorporate them into the execution of future projects.\n\nWe bear and live responsibility for our world. We pay attention to preserving the diversity of plants and animals and to a healthy environment for our children and grandchildren... and their children.\n\nINTEC is inspiring because we rely on fair, open and positive interactions with one another. Our partners are always partners on an equal footing. We keep our social and ecological responsibility in focus. Consistency and reliability ensure the trust of our employees and partners and the quality of our work.\n\nOpen approach to other cultures without prejudice, real remuneration and recognition of achievements, \"FAIRE TRADE\", are among our most important basic attitudes.\n\nThey are the basis of our success.\n\nOur customers appreciate that we, together with our suppliers, service partners and subcontractors, concentrate entirely on them.\n\nSuccess and security are particularly evident in the economic categories. The economy and profitability of our technology result in sustainable customer relationships. In the long term, it's always about added value for the customer and for our company.\n\nWhen customers say to us, \"the INTEC system is very profitable,\" we see it as an expression of our clients' satisfaction.\n\nWe have been working successfully with numerous customers for decades. For us, this means that our principle “the pursuit of the best quality” is accepted.\n\nKeeping the ecological footprint as small as possible is reflected in the entire manufacturing process, purchasing, distribution and safety policy.\n\nOur responsibility towards the environment and our fellow human beings is an irrefutable principle that has shaped our thinking for more than a quarter of a century."
