        "text": "Berlin, January 8, 2020 – TIS Inc., a comprehensive IT service provider based in Japan, covering a wide spectrum of industries and sectors with everything from core systems to applications (including development, data-centers and cloud services), and the University of Aizu have announced the successful completion of a Proof of Concept (PoC) which will further help the automation of a logistics system, through effective collaboration between Inventory Management Systems and Autonomous Mobile Robots.\n\nThe PoC took place on November 26-29 at LICTiA, University of Aizu’s Laboratory for leading-edge ICT. The first university in Japan solely dedicated to computer science and engineering, Aizu trains robot engineers and foster the adoption of robotics technologies through activities such as research and development of robots, their software, cloud robotics, and standardization in the robotics domain.\n\nPart of the TIS INTEC Group (comprising 60 IT companies and 20,000 employees worldwide), TIS Inc. has more than 3,000 customers across varied industries such as financial services, manufacturing, logistics/distribution, public services and telecommunications, with a strong presence in China and the ASEAN region. Besides providing cutting-edge IT solution services, TIS Inc. contributes to the growth of its customers’ businesses by being their technology partner and offering global support.\n\nTIS Inc. has been a Gold member of FIWARE Foundation since 2018, applying FIWARE to data interfacing with robot-to-robot connections as well as data interfacing with robots, IoT, open data and other solution components.\n\nA social-economic Background\n\nUsing service robots in human places is a promising approach to solve social problems such as labor shortage and an aging population. However, the role of robots has not yet been defined in conventional business systems. TIS has been developing RoboticBase to enable the collaboration between service robots and business systems.\n\nOn that front, TIS and the University of Aizu plan to launch a new PoC targeted to solve social problems in several cities in the Fukushima prefecture, such as Aizu-Wakamatsu and Minami-Soma.\n\nAbout RoboticBase\n\nRoboticBase is a platform for commercial use, based on RoboticBase-Core to achieve integrated management of service robots and IoT sensors based on FIWARE, which provides the fundamental framework of RoboticBase for IoT and Smart City applications. RoboticBase includes RoboticBase-Core for research and development and RoboticBase for enterprise use.\n\nIt enables the integration and management of heterogeneous robots, which have different tasks such as security, cleaning, transportation and other tasks, supporting the collaboration of the robots with people and business systems. The current version supports only service robots but will support drones in the future.\n\nAbout RoboticBase-Core\n\nRoboticBase-Core provides core components of RoboticBase for research and development. TIS provides it in the form of open source software.\n\nUpcoming Outreach and Shows\n\nExpanding the outreach of the project in the field of service robots, TIS will push the standardization of data models used in the interface between the RoboticBase system and autonomous mobile robots facilitating the connectivity. Furthermore, several actions are planned to validate and register the defined data models as FIWARE data models. This standardization effort will take place as part of the activities of the Robotics Tech Roadmap Working Group (WG).\n\nCoordinated by FIWARE Foundation, the WG discusses the potential of FIWARE technology in the Robotics field and it is composed by FIWARE Foundation members, such as TIS, Fraunhofer IML, Atos, eProsima, and many others. The Working Group is planning to publish a position paper on Robotics and FIWARE during the Hannover Fair (April 20-24, Germany). Stop by at FIWARE’s booth (Hall 8, Stand C25) to learn more about FIWARE’s community complete offering for Industrie 4.0. and meet the FIWARE partners who will be showcasing FIWARE-powered solutions and use cases for Smart Industry."
