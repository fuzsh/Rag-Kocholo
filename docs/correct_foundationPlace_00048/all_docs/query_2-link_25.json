Subject: [Seagull-users] Diameter Grouped AVP & external data file Hi, I'm currently trying to use an external data file with Diamter. Specifical= ly I'd like to replace the Subscription-Id-Data avp which is part of the Su= bscription-Id grouped avp. After many failed attempts trying to get this t= o work I followed the example on the associated wiki page which details thi= s very scenario. However when I modify my dictionary to substitute \"OctetS= tring\" for \"Grouped\" in relation to the Subscription-Id avp as suggested I = get the error \"value is mandatory for [avp] definition\" when I try to run. I'm currently running version 1.6.0 of Seagull. Any help would be apprecia= ted.
