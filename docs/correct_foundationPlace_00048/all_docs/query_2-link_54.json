From this starting point the company has expanded both organically and through acquisition. Intec became a public company in 2000, following its IPO on the London stock exchange. The following year it completed its first acquisition, with the purchase of Computer Generation Inc (CGI). In 2002 Intec further consolidated the interconnect billing market with acquisitions from ICL and Ericsson. In 2003 Intec entered the IP services mediation and charging market with the acquisition of Digiquant (subsequently sold to [http://www.volubill.com/ Volubill] ). The Digiquant acquisition was followed in 2004 with the acquisition of the Singl.eView product line from ADC . In 2007 Intec acquired EUR systems, a USA based provider of bureau services, which has been integrated with Intec’s other managed services and outsourcing facilities.\n\nExternal links"
