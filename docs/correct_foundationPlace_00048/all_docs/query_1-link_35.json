        "text": "ATLANTA & LONDON--Intec Telecom Systems today announced that it has successfully completed a performance benchmark of Intec Convergent Billing v6, its market-leading billing and customer care system, using Sun Fire(TM) E6900 servers running the Solaris(TM) 10 Operating System (OS). The benchmark demonstrated the capability to handle sustained, minimal latency throughput for a tier 1 mobile carrier with a customer base equivalent to over 20 million pre-paid subscribers. The benchmark was based on a current customer implementation and reflected realistic operating conditions and data. Intec Convergent Billing v6 offers scalable, leading-edge performance for any combination of payment method and communications technology, including pre- and post-paid, fixed, wireless, and next-generation services, for operators and service providers of all types and sizes.\n\n\"Both outright performance and true scalability are key requirements for our high-growth customers, many of whom are adding millions of new subscribers every year,\" said Gary Bunney, Intec's COO. \"Showing that Intec Convergent Billing can support more than 20 million pre-paid subscribers on just two Sun servers is an outstanding result. This benchmark provides further evidence of our ability to provide both new entrant and tier 1 service providers with market-leading performance and scalability on our completely convergent charging and billing platform.\"\n\nThe benchmark was conducted in April 2007 at Sun Microsystems' performance laboratory in Frankfurt, Germany on two Sun Fire E6900 servers, each with 24 dual-core processors running at 1.8 GHz, in a clustered configuration with a shared database. The benchmark demonstrated high performance and linear scalability across a range of real-time convergent rating, balance management, on-line transaction processing, charging and billing tasks from a typical large carrier environment.\n\n\"This benchmark shows that the Sun Fire E6900 server platform running the Solaris 10 OS is an excellent choice for large communications service providers,\" said Kent Lockyer, Director of Communications Solutions, Sun Microsystems. \"We are proud that Intec Convergent Billing v6 on Sun Fire E6900 servers is able to manage the demanding workloads and deliver the real-time performance necessary for a modern, converged service provider.\"\n\nThe test included both on-line and off-line charging. While performing on-line charging (a standard requirement in pre-paid or now-paid services), Intec Convergent Billing v6 achieved sustained throughput representing 25 million service requests per hour. Transaction latency was outstanding, averaging less than 32ms per service request.\n\nIntec Convergent Billing v6 is Intec's market leading billing and customer management system, relied upon by many of the largest and most innovative telecommunications service providers worldwide. Its efficient architecture allows service providers to lower their operating cost by supporting all rating, balance management, charging and billing tasks on a single platform, serving pre-paid, post-paid and multi-pay customers for all classes of product.\n\nAbout Intec\n\nIntec supplies solutions to over 60 of the world's top 100 telecoms carriers and is one of the world's fastest growing major BSS/OSS (business and operations support systems) vendors.
