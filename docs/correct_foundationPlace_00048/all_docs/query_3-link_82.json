        "text": "Synopsis\n\nPrivate 5G/4G cellular networks – also referred to as NPNs (Non-Public Networks) in 3GPP terminology – are rapidly gaining popularity across a diverse range of vertical industries. The utilities sector is no exception to this trend and will see global spending on dedicated cellular networks grow at a CAGR of 15% over the next three years. Estimated to account for nearly $2 Billion in cumulative infrastructure spending between 2023 and 2026, private cellular networks for utilities range from wide area 3GPP networks – operating in 410 MHz, 450 MHz, 900 MHz and other sub-1 GHz spectrum bands – for smart grid communications to purpose-built 5G and LTE networks aimed at providing localized wireless connectivity in critical infrastructure facilities such as power plants, substations and offshore wind farms. Some notable examples are listed below:\n\nAmerican utility companies have made substantial investments in acquiring 900 MHz and 3.5 GHz CBRS PAL (Priority Access License) spectrum within their service territories. Ameren, Evergy, Hawaiian Electric, LCRA (Lower Colorado River Authority), SCE (Southern California Edison), SDG&E (San Diego Gas & Electric), Southern Company and Xcel Energy are among the growing number of utilities that are implementing 3GPP-based private wireless networks in support of grid modernization programs.\n\n450connect is rolling out a nationwide 450 MHz LTE network for the digitization of energy and water utilities as well as other critical industries in Germany.\n\nUsing its 410 MHz spectrum holdings, ESB Networks is implementing a national private mobile network to meet the wireless connectivity needs of smart grid applications for the control, protection and management of Ireland’s utility assets.\n\nFrench multinational electric utility group EDF is deploying private mobile networks to bring secure cellular connectivity to its nuclear power plants.\n\nEnel's global private communications platform leverages a multi-national secure MVNO service for connectivity across the Italian energy giant's global footprint and end-to-end private LTE/5G networks to provide localized wireless coverage for reliable communications in business-critical areas.\n\nFollowing the conclusion of pilots, pre-implementation testing and procurement contracts, PGE (Polish Energy Group) is implementing a 450 MHz mission-critical LTE network for the wide area operations of electricity and gas DSOs (Distribution System Operators) across Poland.\n\nBahrain's EWA (Electricity and Water Authority) has deployed a 410 MHz private LTE network as part of an effort to modernize, digitize and automate its distribution infrastructure for improved grid efficiency, performance and security.\n\nCSG (China Southern Power Grid) relies on both LTE-based private cellular systems and end-to-end 5G network slicing over commercial mobile operator networks to fulfill the wireless communications needs of its smart electric power grid.\n\nSGCC (State Grid Corporation of China) has deployed a private 5G NR-U (NR in Unlicensed Spectrum) network – operating in license-exempt Band n46 (5.8 GHz) spectrum – to support video surveillance, mobile inspection robots and other 5G-connected applications at its Lanzhou East and Mogao substations in China's Gansu province.\n\nKEPCO (Korea Electric Power Corporation) has implemented private 5G network infrastructure – operating in 4.7 GHz and 28 GHz spectrum – at two of its substation sites to enhance real-time monitoring and control capabilities through digital twin technology, 5G-connected wearable cameras and autonomous robots.\n\nKansai Electric Power is using a local 5G network and 5G-connected drones at the Eurus Akita Port wind farm in Akita (Tohoku), Japan, to enhance the maintenance and inspection of wind turbine blades.\n\nEdesur Dominicana relies on a custom-built 2.3 GHz LTE network to connect critical grid assets that require high availability close to 100%.\n\nCPFL Energia has set up a 250 MHz private LTE network in São Leopoldo (Rio Grande do Sul), Brazil, to facilitate the automation of devices in distribution and transmission networks.\n\nThe \"Private 5G/4G Cellular Networks for Utilities: 2023 – 2030\" research package provides detailed market analysis and forecasts for private 5G and LTE networks across 15 vertical industries, including utilities. The package includes the full edition of SNS Telecom & IT's \"Private LTE & 5G Network Ecosystem: 2023 – 2030 – Opportunities, Challenges, Strategies, Industry Verticals & Forecasts\" report and a datasheet with additional private 5G/4G infrastructure investment forecasts for the utilities sector.\n\nTable of Contents\n\nReport 1: The Private LTE & 5G Network Ecosystem: 2023 – 2030 – Opportunities, Challenges, Strategies, Industry Verticals & Forecasts\n\n1 Chapter 1: Introduction\n\n2 Chapter 2: An Overview of Private LTE & 5G Networks\n\n3 Chapter 3: Private LTE/5G System Architecture & Technologies\n\n4 Chapter 4: Key Vertical Industries & Applications\n\n5 Chapter 5: Spectrum Availability, Allocation & Usage\n\n6 Chapter 6: Standardization, Regulatory & Collaborative Initiatives\n\n7 Chapter 7: Review of Private LTE/5G Installations Worldwide\n\n8 Chapter 8: Private LTE/5G Case Studies\n\n9 Chapter 9: Key Ecosystem Players\n\n10 Chapter 10: Market Sizing & Forecasts\n\n11 Chapter 11: Conclusion & Strategic Recommendations\n\nFor a more detailed table of contents, please visit: https://www.snstelecom.com/private-lte\n\nDatasheet 2: Private 5G/4G Cellular Networks for Utilities: 2023 – 2030 – Infrastructure Spending Forecasts\n\nGlobal Private 5G/4G Network Infrastructure Revenue in the Utilities Sector: 2023 – 2030 ($ Million)\n\nGlobal Private 5G/4G Network Revenue in the Utilities Sector by Infrastructure Submarket: 2023 – 2030 ($ Million)\n\nGlobal Private 5G/4G RAN Unit Shipments in the Utilities Sector: 2023 – 2030 (Thousands of Units)\n\nGlobal Private 5G/4G RAN Revenue in the Utilities Sector: 2023 – 2030 ($ Million)\n\nGlobal Private 5G/4G Mobile Core Revenue in the Utilities Sector: 2023 – 2030 ($ Million)\n\nGlobal Private 5G/4G Transport Network Revenue in the Utilities Sector: 2023 – 2030 ($ Million)\n\nGlobal Private 5G/4G Network Revenue in the Utilities Sector by Technology Generation: 2023 – 2030 ($ Million)\n\nGlobal Private LTE Network Revenue in the Utilities Sector by Infrastructure Submarket: 2023 – 2030 ($ Million)\n\nGlobal Private 5G Network Revenue in the Utilities Sector by Infrastructure Submarket: 2023 – 2030 ($ Million)\n\nGlobal Private 5G/4G RU Shipments in the Utilities Sector by Cell Type: 2023 – 2030 (Thousands of Units)\n\nGlobal Private 5G/4G RU Revenue in the Utilities Sector by Cell Type: 2023 – 2030 ($ Million)\n\nPrivate 5G/4G Network Infrastructure Revenue in the Utilities Sector by Region: 2023 – 2030 ($ Million)\n\nNorth America Private 5G/4G Network Revenue in the Utilities Sector by Infrastructure Submarket: 2023 – 2030 ($ Million)\n\nAsia Pacific Private 5G/4G Network Revenue in the Utilities Sector by Infrastructure Submarket: 2023 – 2030 ($ Million)\n\nEurope Private 5G/4G Network Revenue in the Utilities Sector by Infrastructure Submarket: 2023 – 2030 ($ Million)\n\nMiddle East & Africa Private 5G/4G Network Revenue in the Utilities Sector by Infrastructure Submarket: 2023 – 2030 ($ Million)\n\nLatin & Central America Private 5G/4G Network Revenue in the Utilities Sector by Infrastructure Submarket: 2023 – 2030 ($ Million)"
