This loan applies directly to your tuition and fee account when Scholarships & Financial Aid receives the signed Master Promissory Note. If you have signed a Master Promissory Note for an Emergency Tuition and Fees loan from a prior semester, you do not have to sign another promissory note.\n\nAfter the loan is approved, you will receive instructions on how to sign a promissory note.\n\nDepending upon timing, any financial aid refund may apply toward your ETFL, but this is not always the case. It is your responsibility to use any refunds issued to you to repay an outstanding ETFL and to ensure your outstanding ETFL balance is at zero by the loan due date.\n\nFor more information, refer to the Emergency Tuition & Fee Loan\n\nThe Watkins International Loan Fund was created in 1993 to assist international students who face short-term financial emergencies. The fund is named after Tina Watkins, who was the Director of ISS from 1979 to 1995. She recognized the urgent need for such a loan fund because of the special circumstances that international students experience.\n\nThe fund allows a small number of international students to be helped with short-term, repayable, no-interest loans of $1,000 or less in case of financial emergency. The number of loans that can be approved is limited by the modest size of the fund.\n\nGraduating students have been important supporters of the fund by donating to the fund upon completion of their studies. Contributions to the Watkins International Loan Fund of any size are always welcome and are tax deductible to the extent permitted by law.\n\nFor more information, contact ISSS directly\n\nAlternative (private) loans are administered and processed by private lending institutions to be used for educational costs.\n\nFor more information, please see the Alternative Loans page or visit ELMSelect to search for an Alternative Loan.\n\nOther Scholarship Opportunities\n\nThe Florence Terry Griswold Scholarship is awarded annually by the Pan American Round Tables of Texas. This scholarship, named in honor of the founder of the Pan American Round Tables, assists a female student from one of the Pan American countries (other than the United States) in pursuing her studies in the state of Texas.\n\nFor more information, please refer to the Pan American Round Tables of Texas"
