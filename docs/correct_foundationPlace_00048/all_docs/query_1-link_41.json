        "text": "Rick Woods, Volubill's newly appointed\n\nVice President of North America\n\nLondon and Atlanta, Georgia, USA. April 19, 2010 — Volubill, a provider of charging and policy control systems, has established its North American headquarters in Atlanta, GA, and appointed industry veteran, Rick Woods as Vice President of the region. The office and appointment will support Volubill’s growing customer base in the US, while adding value to the existing regional team.\n\nRick has joined Volubill from Intec Telecom Systems where he was a Vice President in the Product organisation and working in mediation technology. He will now be responsible for growing North American sales and operations, and from 2011, that of Central and Latin America (CALA).\n\n\"US operators are looking at Policy Control and Online Charging with great interest as a means to intelligently manage their network resources and reconnect their revenue model with their cost model,\" said John Aalbers, CEO, Volubill. \"This is clearly being reflected by the significant increase in interest we are seeing in our product set in North America. In the case of mobile broadband, great devices, great applications and customer appetite have caused demand for bandwidth to skyrocket, With flat rate charging models prevalent, US operators need concrete solutions to help them better manage that growth whilst making their data services profitable. Volubill is delighted to bring its expertise and its solutions direct to operators in the region through our new local presence.\"\n\nAalbers continues, “We are making a significant investment in North America and we need an exceptional leader to take the reins. Rick Woods is a charismatic visionary who combines deep technical strength with insightful market awareness and customer orientation. His experience in taking new products into new markets will serve us extremely well as we look to support a growing demand for our solutions in the Americas.”\n\nVolubill’s policy control and charging systems aim to equip service providers with immediate and cost-effective relief to efficiently manage exploding data usage. Fully compliant with 3GPP's Policy and Charging Rules Function (PCRF) specifications, Volubill’s CHARGE-IT™ and CONTROL-IT™ products provide real-time intelligence so that operators can dynamically allocate resources to maximise throughput within the limits of their existing networks, helping to control network growth-related capital expenditures and capitalise on premium, revenue-generating new services.\n\nVolubill provides innovative 'on the network' charging and policy control systems to telecom operators worldwide. These enable operators to manage bandwidth based on subscriber- and service-centric usage policies and quotas, in order to maximise revenues and service experience and eliminate churn. Transcending the boundaries between the network and IT systems, Volubill provides flexibility and unlocks the potential of real-time BSS integration. Founded in 2001, Volubill is a global company with more than 75 customers worldwide."
