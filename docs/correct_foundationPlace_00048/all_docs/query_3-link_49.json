Introduction Intec 2023: the decline of the pyramids, governing the ecosystems\n\nBoth the economy and the provision of public services are evolving towards a new software-enabled model, which implies higher update rates and the need for more public-private collaboration in problem solving. In Spain, the low level of penetration of key technologies in our productive fabric is serious,...\n\nFurther information\n\n1. Generative AI in search of business models\n\nThe explosion of generative artificial intelligence leaves open questions about the availability of information, the business models and use cases that will really justify its application in the economy and, of course, the ethical implications of its generalisation.\n\nFurther information\n\n2. The awakening of intelligence in textiles\n\nThe impact of textiles on the planet, especially the environmental cost of the production of raw materials and the waste derived from them, forces us to rethink their function and their capacity to last, as a way to facilitate a change in consumer habits.\n\nFurther information\n\n3. mRNA vaccines, the new paradigm\n\nVaccine development has undergone a qualitative shift with the emergence of messenger RNA-based solutions during the pandemic and the effects will also be felt in personalised therapies - it is time to pave the way for an explosion of innovation.\n\nFurther information\n\n4. Digital fire extinguishers\n\nBoosting innovation and investment in the prevention phase is one of the tasks ahead in tackling one of the most dramatic consequences of climate change, while improving the availability and processing of data.\n\nFurther information\n\n5. Reinventing the way we inhabit our homes\n\nFrom new materials to the circular economy and, of course, the digital revolution: the way we build and the refurbishment of existing building stock has become an avenue for innovation that integrates many sectors.\n\nFurther information\n\n6. The quantum revolution, on the verge of exploding\n\nThe promise of the second quantum revolution is already on the horizon, but to make it a reality, innovation challenges such as those related to materials and their availability or device design must be overcome.\n\nFurther information\n\n7. A technological shield for all-out cyberwarfare\n\nThe protection of digital assets and critical infrastructure has not only become a challenge for the economy, but will shape the ability of individuals to exercise their freedoms and of democracies to function without constraints.\n\nFurther information\n\n8. Intelligent diagnostics, technologies for anticipating life\n\nHealthcare systems will undergo a huge transformation as the confluence of digital technologies, genetics and photonics enables earlier diagnosis of diseases and even real-time monitoring of people's condition.\n\nFurther information\n\n9. The heartbeat of 5G private networks\n\nNew connectivity technologies, such as 5G-6G and Wi-Fi 6e-Wi-Fi 7, will drive automation on a scale never seen before, and pose an innovation and business model challenge that the regulatory framework must help solve.\n\nFurther information\n\n10. The new face of nuclear energy\n\nThe race for Small Modular Reactors (SMRs) is on around the world and could determine the competitiveness of economies as well as their contribution to reducing CO2 emissions and producing green hydrogen.\n\nFurther information\n\nDownloads:"
