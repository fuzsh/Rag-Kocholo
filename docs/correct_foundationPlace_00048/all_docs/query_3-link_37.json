        "text": "Abstract\n\nThis study shows why and when optical systems need thickness as well as width or area. Wave diffraction explains the fundamental need for area or diameter of a lens or aperture to achieve some resolution or number of pixels in microscopes and cameras. This work demonstrates that if we know what the optics is to do, even before design, we can also deduce the minimum required thickness. This limit comes from diffraction combined with a concept called overlapping nonlocality C that can be deduced rigorously from just the mathematical description of what the device is to do. C expresses how much the input regions for different output regions overlap. This limit applies broadly to optics, from cameras to metasurfaces, and to wave systems generally.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1126/science.ade3395\n\nView details for PubMedID 36603071\n\nAbstract\n\nThe growing maturity of integrated photonic technology makes it possible to build increasingly large and complex photonic circuits on the surface of a chip. Today, most of these circuits are designed for a specific application, but the increase in complexity has introduced a generation of photonic circuits that can be programmed using software for a wide variety of functions through a mesh of on-chip waveguides, tunable beam couplers and optical phase shifters. Here we discuss the state of this emerging technology, including recent developments in photonic building blocks and circuit architectures, as well as electronic control and programming strategies. We cover possible applications in linear matrix operations, quantum information processing and microwave photonics, and examine how these generic chips can accelerate the development of future photonic circuits by providing a higher-level platform for prototyping novel optical functionalities without the need for custom chip fabrication.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1038/s41586-020-2764-0\n\nView details for PubMedID 33028997\n\nAbstract\n\nWe derive four laws relating the absorptivity and emissivity of thermal emitters. Unlike the original Kirchhoff radiation law derivations, these derivations include diffraction, and so are valid also for small objects, and can also cover nonreciprocal objects. The proofs exploit two recent approaches. First, we express all fields in terms of the mode-converter basis sets of beams; these sets, which can be uniquely established for any linear optical object, give orthogonal input beams that are coupled one-by-one to orthogonal output beams. Second, we consider thought experiments using universal linear optical machines, which allow us to couple appropriate beams and black bodies. Two of these laws can be regarded as rigorous extensions of previously known laws: One gives a modal version of a radiation law for reciprocal objects-the absorptivity of any input beam equals the emissivity into the \"backward\" (i.e., phase-conjugated) version of that beam; another gives the overall equality of the sums of the emissivities and the absorptivities for any object, including nonreciprocal ones. The other two laws, valid for reciprocal and nonreciprocal objects, are quite different from previous relations. One shows universal equivalence of the absorptivity of each mode-converter input beam and the emissivity into its corresponding scattered output beam. The other gives unexpected equivalences of absorptivity and emissivity for broad classes of beams. Additionally, we prove these orthogonal mode-converter sets of input and output beams are the ones that maximize absorptivities and emissivities, respectively, giving these beams surprising additional physical meaning.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1073/pnas.1701606114\n\nView details for Web of Science ID 000399995600040\n\nView details for PubMedID 28396436\n\nAbstract\n\nWe show how a spatial mode can be extracted from a light beam, leaving the other orthogonal modes undisturbed, and allowing a new signal to be retransmitted on that mode. The method is self-aligning, avoids fundamental splitting losses, and uses only local feedback loops on controllable beam splitters and phase shifters. It could be implemented with Mach-Zehnder interferometers in planar optics. The method can be extended to multiple simultaneous mode extractions. As a spatial reconfigurable optical add-drop multiplexer, it is hitless, allowing reconfiguration without interrupting the transmission of any channel.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1364/OE.21.020220\n\nView details for Web of Science ID 000323830500075\n\nView details for PubMedID 24105567\n\nAbstract\n\nWe propose a device that can take an arbitrary monochromatic input beam and, automatically and without any calculations, couple it into a single-mode guide or beam. Simple feedback loops from detectors to modulator elements allow the device to adapt to any specific input beam form. Potential applications include automatic compensation for misalignment and defocusing of an input beam, coupling of complex modes or multiple beams from fibers or free space to single-mode guides, and retaining coupling to a moving source. Straightforward extensions allow multiple different overlapping orthogonal input beams to be separated simultaneously to different single-mode guides with no splitting loss in principle. The approach is suitable for implementation in integrated optics platforms that offer elements such as phase shifters, Mach-Zehnder interferometers, grating couplers, and integrated monitoring detectors, and the basic approach is applicable in principle to other types of waves, such as microwaves or acoustics.\n\nView details for PubMedID 23482206\n\nAbstract\n\nWe analyze how complicated a linear optical component has to be if it is to perform one of a range of functions. Specifically, we devise an approach to evaluating the number of real parameters that must be specified in the device design or fabrication, based on the singular value decomposition of the linear operator that describes the device. This approach can be used for essentially any linear device, including space-, frequency-, or time-dependent systems, in optics, or in other linear wave problems. We analyze examples including spatial mode converters and various classes of wavelength demultiplexers. We consider limits on the functions that can be performed by simple optical devices, such as thin lenses, mirrors, gratings, modulators, and fixed optical filters, and discuss the potential for greater functionalities using modern nanophotonics.\n\nView details for PubMedID 23456059\n\nAbstract\n\nWe show that every linear optical component can be completely described as a device that converts one set of orthogonal input modes, one by one, to a matching set of orthogonal output modes. This result holds for any linear optical structure with any specific variation in space and/or time of its structure. There are therefore preferred orthogonal \"mode converter\" basis sets of input and output functions for describing any linear optical device, in terms of which the device can be described by a simple diagonal operator. This result should help us understand what linear optical devices we can and cannot make. As illustrations, we use this approach to derive a general expression for the alignment tolerance of an efficient mode coupler and to prove that loss-less combining of orthogonal modes is impossible.\n\nView details for PubMedID 23188365\n\nAbstract\n\nWe analyze energy consumption in optical modulators operated in depletion and intended for low-power interconnect applications. We include dynamic dissipation from charging modulator capacitance and net energy consumption from absorption and photocurrent, both in reverse and small forward bias. We show that dynamic dissipation can be independent of static bias, though only with specific kinds of bias circuits. We derive simple expressions for the effects of photocurrent on energy consumption, valid in both reverse and small forward bias. Though electroabsorption modulators with large reverse bias have substantial energy penalties from photocurrent dissipation, we argue that modulator diodes with thin depletion regions and operating in small reverse and/or forward bias could have little or no such photocurrent energy penalty, even conceivably being more energy-efficient than an ideal loss-less modulator.\n\nView details for PubMedID 22418679\n\nAbstract\n\nThe use of optical interconnects has burgeoned as a promising technology that can address the limits of data transfer for future high-performance silicon chips. Recent pushes to enhance optical communication have focused on developing wavelength-division multiplexing technology, and new dimensions of data transfer will be paramount to fulfill the ever-growing need for speed. Here we demonstrate an integrated multi-dimensional communication scheme that combines wavelength- and mode- multiplexing on a silicon photonic circuit. Using foundry-compatible photonic inverse design and spectrally flattened microcombs, we demonstrate a 1.12-Tb/s natively error-free data transmission throughout a silicon nanophotonic waveguide. Furthermore, we implement inverse-designed surface-normal couplers to enable multimode optical transmission between separate silicon chips throughout a multimode-matched fibre. All the inverse-designed devices comply with the process design rules for standard silicon photonic foundries. Our approach is inherently scalable to a multiplicative enhancement over the state of the art silicon photonic transmitters.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1038/s41467-022-35446-4\n\nView details for PubMedID 36543782\n\nView details for PubMedCentralID PMC9772188\n\nAbstract\n\nPhase contrast microscopy has played a central role in the development of modern biology, geology, and nanotechnology. It can visualize the structure of translucent objects that remains hidden in regular optical microscopes. The optical layout of a phase contrast microscope is based on a 4 f image processing setup and has essentially remained unchanged since its invention by Zernike in the early 1930s. Here, we propose a conceptually new approach to phase contrast imaging that harnesses the non-local optical response of a guided-mode-resonator metasurface. We highlight its benefits and demonstrate the imaging of various phase objects, including biological cells, polymeric nanostructures, and transparent metasurfaces. Our results showcase that the addition of this non-local metasurface to a conventional microscope enables quantitative phase contrast imaging with a 0.02π phase accuracy. At a high level, this work adds to the growing body of research aimed at the use of metasurfaces for analog optical computing.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1038/s41467-022-34197-6\n\nView details for PubMedID 36543788\n\nView details for PubMedCentralID PMC9772391\n\nAbstract\n\nFree-space optics naturally offers multiple-channel communications and sensing exploitable in many applications. The different optical beams will, however, generally be overlapping at the receiver, and, especially with atmospheric turbulence or other scattering or aberrations, the arriving beam shapes may not even be known in advance. We show that such beams can be still separated in the optical domain, and simultaneously detected with negligible cross-talk, even if they share the same wavelength and polarization, and even with unknown arriving beam shapes. The kernel of the adaptive multibeam receiver presented in this work is a programmable integrated photonic processor that is coupled to free-space beams through a two-dimensional array of optical antennas. We demonstrate separation of beam pairs arriving from different directions, with overlapping spatial modes in the same direction, and even with mixing between the beams deliberately added in the path. With the circuit's optical bandwidth of more than 40nm, this approach offers an enabling technology for the evolution of FSO from single-beam to multibeam space-division multiplexed systems in a perturbed environment, which has been a game-changing transition in fiber-optic systems.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1038/s41377-022-00884-8\n\nView details for PubMedID 35787626\n\nAbstract\n\nThere has been significant recent interest in synthetic dimensions, where internal degrees of freedom of a particle are coupled to form higher-dimensional lattices in lower-dimensional physical structures. For these systems, the concept of band structure along the synthetic dimension plays a central role in their theoretical description. Here we provide a direct experimental measurement of the band structure along the synthetic dimension. By dynamically modulating a resonator at frequencies commensurate with its mode spacing, we create a periodically driven lattice of coupled modes in the frequency dimension. The strength and range of couplings can be dynamically reconfigured by changing the modulation amplitude and frequency. We show theoretically and demonstrate experimentally that time-resolved transmission measurements of this system provide a direct readout of its band structure. We also realize long-range coupling, gauge potentials and nonreciprocal bands by simply incorporating additional frequency drives, enabling great flexibility in band structure engineering.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1038/s41467-019-11117-9\n\nView details for PubMedID 31311928\n\nAbstract\n\nPropagation of light beams through scattering or multimode systems may lead to the randomization of the spatial coherence of the light. Although information is not lost, its recovery requires a coherent interferometric reconstruction of the original signals, which have been scrambled into the modes of the scattering system. Here we show that we can automatically unscramble optical beams that have been arbitrarily mixed in a multimode waveguide, undoing the scattering and mixing between the spatial modes through a mesh of silicon photonics tuneable beam splitters. Transparent light detectors integrated in a photonic chip are used to directly monitor the evolution of each mode along the mesh, allowing sequential tuning and adaptive individual feedback control of each beam splitter. The entire mesh self-configures automatically through a progressive tuning algorithm and resets itself after significantly perturbing the mixing, without turning off the beams. We demonstrate information recovery by the simultaneous unscrambling, sorting and tracking of four mixed modes, with residual cross-talk of -20 dB between the beams. Circuit partitioning assisted by transparent detectors enables scalability to meshes with a higher port count and to a higher number of modes without a proportionate increase in the control complexity. The principle of self-configuring and self-resetting in optical systems should be applicable in a wide range of optical applications.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1038/lsa.2017.110\n\nView details for PubMedID 30167222\n\nView details for PubMedCentralID PMC6062024\n\nAbstract\n\nWe present an iterative design method for the coupling and the mode conversion of arbitrary modes to focused surface plasmons using a large array of aperiodically randomly located slits in a thin metal film. As the distance between the slits is small and the number of slits is large, significant mutual coupling occurs between the slits which makes an accurate computation of the field scattered by the slits difficult. We use an accurate modal source radiator model to efficiently compute the fields in a significantly shorter time compared with three-dimensional (3D) full-field rigorous simulations, so that iterative optimization is efficiently achieved. Since our model accounts for mutual coupling between the slits, the scattering by the slits of both the source wave and the focused surface plasmon can be incorporated in the optimization scheme. We apply this method to the design of various types of couplers for arbitrary fiber modes and a mode demultiplexer that focuses three orthogonal fiber modes to three different foci. Finally, we validate our design results using fully vectorial 3D finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) simulations.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1364/OE.22.000646\n\nView details for PubMedID 24515024\n\nAbstract\n\nWe demonstrate the use of a subwavelength planar metal-dielectric resonant cavity to enhance the absorption of germanium photodetectors at wavelengths beyond the material's direct absorption edge, enabling high responsivity across the entire telecommunications C and L bands. The resonant wavelength of the detectors can be tuned linearly by varying the width of the Ge fin, allowing multiple detectors, each resonant at a different wavelength, to be fabricated in a single-step process. This approach is promising for the development of CMOS-compatible devices suitable for integrated, high-speed, and energy-efficient photodetection at telecommunications wavelengths.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1364/OE.21.010228\n\nView details for PubMedID 23609731\n\nAbstract\n\nWe demonstrate electroabsorption contrast greater than 5 dB over the entire telecommunication S- and C-bands with only 1V drive using a new Ge/SiGe QW epitaxy design approach; further, this is demonstrated with the thinnest Ge/SiGe epitaxy to date, using a virtual substrate only 320-nm-thick. We use an eigenmode expansion method to model the optical coupling between SOI waveguides and both vertically and butt-coupled Ge/SiGe devices, and show that this reduction in thickness is expected to lead to a significant improvement in the insertion loss of waveguide-integrated devices.\n\nView details for PubMedID 23388980\n\nAbstract\n\nWe demonstrate vertical-incidence electroabsorption modulators for free-space optical interconnects. The devices operate via the quantum-confined Stark effect in Ge/SiGe quantum wells grown on silicon substrates by reduced pressure chemical vapor deposition. The strong electroabsorption contrast enables use of a moderate-Q asymmetric Fabry-Perot resonant cavity, formed using a film transfer process, which allows for operation over a wide optical bandwidth without thermal tuning. Extinction ratios of 3.4 dB and 2.5 dB are obtained for 3 V and 1.5 V drive swings, respectively, with insertion loss less than 4.5 dB. For 60 ?m diameter devices, large signal modulation is demonstrated at 2 Gbps, and a 3 dB modulation bandwidth of 3.5 GHz is observed. These devices show promise for high-speed, low-energy operation given further miniaturization.\n\nView details for Web of Science ID 000314914500005\n\nView details for PubMedID 23388742\n\nAbstract\n\nWe design an extremely compact photonic crystal waveguide spatial mode converter which converts the fundamental even mode to the higher order odd mode with nearly 100% efficiency.

This geometry allows the center wavelength of the photodetector's spectral response to be controlled by the silicon fin width, allowing multiple detectors, each sensitive to a different wavelength, to be fabricated in a single-step process. In addition, the detectors are highly efficient with simulations showing ~67% of the light (λ = 800 nm) incident on the silicon fin being absorbed in a region of thickness ~170 nm whereas the absorption length at the same wavelength is ~10 µm. This approach is promising for the development of multispectral imaging sensors and low-capacitance photodetectors for short-range optical interconnects.\n\nView details for PubMedID 23037424\n\nAbstract\n\nThis work presents a novel method to introduce a sustainable biaxial tensile strain larger than 1% in a thin Ge membrane using a stressor layer integrated on a Si substrate.

Simulation results predict that a combination of 1.1% strain and heavy n(+) doping reduces the required injected carrier density for population inversion by over a factor of 60.

An array of nanoslits patterned on a thin metal film is used to couple free-space light into surface plasmon polaritons (SPPs) and simultaneously focus different-wavelength SPPs into arbitrary predefined locations in the two-dimensional plane. We design and fabricate a compact triplexer on a glass substrate with an integrated silicon photodetector. The photocurrent spectra demonstrate that the incident light is effectively coupled to SPPs and routed into three different focal spots depending on the wavelength. The proposed scheme provides a simple method of building wavelength-division multiplexing and spectral filtering elements, integrated with other plasmonic and optoelectronic devices.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1021/nl200938h\n\nView details for Web of Science ID 000292849400022\n\nView details for PubMedID 21627101\n\nAbstract\n\nWe measure the intervalley scattering time of electrons in the conduction band of Ge quantum wells from the direct Γ valley to the indirect L valley to be ~185 fs using a pump-probe setup at 1570 nm. We relate this to the width of the exciton peak seen in the absorption spectra of this material, and show that these quantum wells could be used as a fast saturable absorber with a saturation fluence between 0.11 and 0.27 pJ/μm. We also observe field screening by photogenerated carriers in the material on longer timescales. We model this field screening by incorporating carrier escape from the quantum wells, drift across the intrinsic region, and recovery of the applied voltage through diffusive conduction.\n\nView details for PubMedID 21164905\n\nAbstract\n\nUsing a new general approach to limits in optical structures that counts orthogonal waves generated by scattering, we derive an upper limit to the number of bits of delay possible in one-dimensional slow light structures that are based on linear optical response to the signal field. The limit is essentially the product of the length of the structure in wavelengths and the largest relative change in dielectric constant anywhere in the structure at any frequency of interest. It holds for refractive index, absorption, or gain variations with arbitrary spectral or spatial form. It is otherwise completely independent of the details of the structure's design, and does not rely on concepts of group velocity or group delay.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1103/PhysRevLett.99.203903\n\nView details for Web of Science ID 000251003600020\n\nView details for PubMedID 18233141\n\nAbstract\n\nWe propose a novel semiconductor optoelectronic switch that is a fusion of a Ge optical detector and a Si metal-oxide semiconductor field-effect transistor (MOSFET). The device operation is investigated with simulations and experiments. The switch can be fabricated at the nanoscale with extremely low capacitance. This device operates in telecommunication standard wavelengths, hence providing the surrounding Si circuitry with noise immunity from signaling. The Ge gate absorbs light, and the gate photocurrent is amplified at the drain terminal. Experimental current gain of up to 1000x is demonstrated.

The novel side-entry structure employs an asymmetric Fabry-Perot resonator at oblique incidence. Unlike waveguide modulators, the design is insensitive to positional misalignment, maintaining > 3 dB contrast while translating the incident beam 87 mum and 460 mum in orthogonal directions.

Silicon-based optical modulators have recently been successfully demonstrated; but because the light modulation mechanisms in silicon are relatively weak, long (for example, several millimetres) devices or sophisticated high-quality-factor resonators have been necessary. Thin quantum-well structures made from III-V semiconductors such as GaAs, InP and their alloys exhibit the much stronger quantum-confined Stark effect (QCSE) mechanism, which allows modulator structures with only micrometres of optical path length. Such III-V materials are unfortunately difficult to integrate with silicon electronic devices. Germanium is routinely integrated with silicon in electronics, but previous silicon-germanium structures have also not shown strong modulation effects. Here we report the discovery of the QCSE, at room temperature, in thin germanium quantum-well structures grown on silicon. The QCSE here has strengths comparable to that in III-V materials. Its clarity and strength are particularly surprising because germanium is an indirect gap semiconductor; such semiconductors often display much weaker optical effects than direct gap materials (such as the III-V materials typically used for optoelectronics). This discovery is very promising for small, high-speed, low-power optical output devices fully compatible with silicon electronics manufacture.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1038/nature04204\n\nView details for PubMedID 16251959\n\nAbstract\n\nDispersive thin-film stacks are interesting as compact, cost-effective devices for temporal dispersion compensation and wavelength multiplexing. Their performance depends on the total group delay or spatial shift that can be achieved. For general multilayer stacks, no analytic model exists relating the performance to the stack parameters such as the refractive indices and the number of layers. We develop an empirical model by designing and analyzing 623 thin-film stacks with constant dispersion. From this analysis we conclude that, for given stack parameters, the maximum constant dispersion value is inversely proportional to the wavelength range over which the dispersion is achieved. This is equivalent to saying that, for constant dispersion, there is a maximum possible spatial shift (or group delay) that can be achieved for a given material system and number of layers. This empirical model is useful to judge the feasibility of dispersive photonic nanostructures and photonic crystal superprism devices and serves as a first step in the search for an analytic performance model. We predict that an 8-channel wavelength multiplexer can be realized with a single 21-microm-thick SiO2-Ta2O5 thin-film stack.\n\nView details for PubMedID 15943271\n\nAbstract\n\nWe use Hamiltonian optics to design and analyze beam propagation in two-dimensional (2D) periodic structures with slowly varying nonuniformities. We extend a conventional Hamiltonian method, adding equations for calculating the width of a beam propagating in such structures, and quantify the range of validity of the extended Hamiltonian equations. For calculating the beam width, the equations are more than 10(3) times faster than finite difference time domain (FDTD) simulations. We perform FDTD simulations of beam propagation in large 2D periodic structures with slowly varying nonuniformities to validate our method. Beam path and beam width calculated using the extended Hamiltonian method show good agreement with FDTD simulations. By contrasting the method with ray tracing of the bundle of rays, we highlight and explain the limitations of the extended Hamiltonian method.

Unlike a conventional spectral signature discrimination system, which needs a dedicated computation subsystem running a discrimination algorithm, the time-domain filtering architecture embeds much of the computation in the filtering, which will aid the design of integrated miniaturized spectral signature discrimination systems.\n\nView details for PubMedID 19466081\n\nAbstract\n\nWe demonstrate how to design thin-film multilayer structures that separate multiple wavelength channels with a single stack by spatial dispersion, thus allowing compact manufacturable wavelength multiplexers and demultiplexers and possibly beam-steering or dispersion-control devices. We discuss four types of structure--periodic one-dimensional photonic crystal superprism structures, double-chirped structures exploiting wavelength-dependent penetration depth, coupled-cavity structures with dispersion that is due to stored energy, and numerically optimized nonperiodic structures utilizing a mixture of the other dispersion effects. We experimentally test the spatial dispersion of a 200-layer periodic structure and a 66-layer nonperiodic structure. Probably because of its greater design freedom, the nonperiodic structure can give both a linear shift with wavelength and a larger usable shift than the thicker periodic structure gives.\n\nView details for PubMedID 12638890\n\nAbstract\n\nWe present a method of spectral discrimination that employs time-domain processing instead of the typical frequency-domain analysis and implement the method in a Michelson interferometer with a nonlinear mirror scan. The technique yields one analog output value per scan instead of a complete interferogram by directly filtering a measured scan with a reference function in the time domain. Such a procedure drastically reduces data-processing requirements downstream. Additionally, using prerecorded interferograms as references eliminates the need to compensate for scan nonlinearities, which broadens the field of usable components for implementation in miniaturized sensing systems. With our efficient use of known spectral signatures, we demonstrate real-time discrimination of 633- and 663-nm laser sources with a mirror scan length of 1 microm , compared with the Rayleigh criterion of 7 microm.\n\nView details for Web of Science ID 000176623100019\n\nView details for PubMedID 18026389\n\nAbstract\n\nStructured optical elements that control the spatial and temporal characteristics of femtosecond light pulses are analyzed and synthesized. We show that unique spatiotemporal effects can be attained based on the diffraction, refraction, and dispersive effects that appear in the femtosecond regime. We argue that the design requirements for ultrafast optics are beyond the achromatization considerations that are usually applied to incoherent illumination because of the need to consider coherent effects. Despite fundamental limitations in the space-time control of ultrashort pulses, we show the potential of this technique to improve simultaneously the spatial and the temporal resolution of a lens and to generate ultrafast pulse sequences.\n\nView details for Web of Science ID 000170759400022\n\nView details for PubMedID 18049613\n\nAbstract\n\nWe present a rigorous electromagnetic formalism for defining, evaluating, and optimizing the degrees of freedom of an optical system. The analysis is valid for the delivery of information with electromagnetic waves under arbitrary boundary conditions communicating between domains in three-dimensional space. We show that, although in principle there is an infinity of degrees of freedom, the effective number is finite owing to the presence of noise. This is in agreement with the restricted classical theories that showed this property for specific optical systems and within the scalar and paraxial approximations. We further show that the best transmitting and receiving functions are the solutions of well-defined eigenvalue equations. The present approach is useful for understanding and designing modern optical systems for which the previous approaches are not applicable, as well as for application in inverse and synthesis problems.\n\nView details for Web of Science ID 000086764500010\n\nAbstract\n\nA rigorous method for finding the best-connected orthogonal communication channels, modes, or degrees of freedom for scalar waves between two volumes of arbitrary shape and position is derived explicitly without assuming planar surfaces or paraxial approximations. The communication channels are the solutions of two eigenvalue problems and are identical to the cavity modes of a double phase-conjugate resonator. A sum rule for the connection strengths is also derived, the sum being a simple volume integral. These results are used to analyze rectangular prism volumes, small volumes, thin volumes in different relative orientations, and arbitrary near-field volumes: all situations in which previous planar approaches have failed for one or more reasons. Previous planar results are reproduced explicitly, extending them to finite depth. Depth is shown not to increase the number of communications modes unless the volumes are close when compared with their depths. How to estimate the connection strengths in some cases without a full solution of the eigenvalue problem is discussed so that estimates of the number of usable communications modes can be made from the sum rule. In general, the approach gives a rigorous basis for handling problems related to volume sources and receivers. It may be especially applicable in near-field problems and in situations in which volume is an intrinsic part of the problem.\n\nView details for PubMedID 18345068\n\nAbstract\n\nWe present a 2-kbit, 50-Mpage/s, photonic first-in, first-out page buffer based on gallium arsenide/aluminium-gallium arsenide multiple-quantum-well diodes that are flip-chip bonded to submicrometer silicon complementary-metal-oxide-semiconductor circuits. This photonic chip provides nonvolatile storage (buffering), asynchronous-to-synchronous conversion, bandwidth smoothing, tolerance to jitter or skew, spatial format conversion, wavelength conversion, and independent flow control for the input and the output channels. It serves as an interface chip for parallel-accessed optical bit-plane data. It represents the first smart-pixel array that accomplishes the vertical integration of multiple-quantum-well modulators and detectors directly over active silicon VLSI circuits and provides over 340 transistors per optical input-output. Results from high-speed single-channel testing and real-time array operation of the photonic page buffer are reported.\n\nView details for Web of Science ID A1996UL34600012\n\nView details for PubMedID 21085380\n\nAbstract\n\nWe describe, demonstrate, and characterize an analog self-electro-optic-effect device that gives a difference between two optical output powers that is linearly proportional to an electrical or an optical drive. Such a device should permit bipolar (positive and negative) processing in novel image processing arrays. The device is able to operate over a range of more than 4 orders of magnitude of optical power from 50 nW to 2.5 mW, corresponding to uniform incident intensities as low as 3.3 mW/cm(2). The frequency response (3-dB limit) varies linearly from 7 kHz at 1-µW absorber power to 3.5 MHz at 1 mW of absorbed powers.\n\nView details for Web of Science ID A1994NC58600019\n\nView details for PubMedID 20862176\n\nAbstract\n\nWe describe an analog self-electro-optic-effect device that gives a difference between two optical output powers that is linearly proportional to electrical or optical drive, permitting bipolar processing in novel image-processing arrays.

The cascadable NOR gate has a fanout of six, restores both the logic level and timing, and can operate at bit rates of up to 0.2 THz. In addition, we show that soliton dragging can be represented as a generalized exclusive-or module with high functionality. Two such modules can be interconnected as NOR and AND gates or broadcast and routing switches.\n\nView details for Web of Science ID A1990DW76800011\n\nView details for PubMedID 19770950\n\nAbstract\n\nWe present new optoelectronic logic devices or circuits consisting of electrically connected quantum well PIN diodes capable of implementing any boolean logic function. One class of circuits uses single beams to represent the logic levels and compares their intensities to a locally generated reference signal. A second class of circuits routes signals as differential pairs. The connections of diodes in these circuits resemble the transistor connections in NMOS and CMOS logic families. We demonstrate simple optical programmable logic arrays (e.g., E = AB + CD) using both of these classes of circuits.\n\nView details for Web of Science ID A1990DC61800023\n\nView details for PubMedID 20563144\n\nAbstract\n\nWe demonstrate quantum well tri-state logic devices for possible use in optical bus architectures. These optical devices are analogous to the tri-state devices often used in electronic buses, where each device can be actively on, actively off, or disabled with at most one device on the bus active at a time. We show two methods of generating these tri-state data, one using tri-state quantum well modulators and one using optical tri-state self-electrooptic effect devices, and we demonstrate a simple optical bus consisting of two such devices. Finally, we comment on the limitations on the number of devices that can be connected to a bus of this type.\n\nView details for Web of Science ID A1990CU29200019\n\nView details for PubMedID 20562974\n\nAbstract\n\nMany semiconductor light modulators rely on changes in excitonic absorption induced by electric fields. We study their temporal response in the framework of a one-dimensional model, for which we solve exactly the timedependent Schrödinger equation. For a homogeneously broadened system, the electroabsorption response time is found to be simply the inverse of the (field-induced) exciton linewidth, which can be as short as 50 fsec.\n\nView details for Web of Science ID A1990CH36900021\n\nView details for PubMedID 19759711\n\nAbstract\n\nUsing a 6 X 6 array of integrated quantum-well self-electro-optic-effect devices, we demonstrate an optically addressed spatial light modulator able to convert a visible, incoherent image into coherent infrared (IR) light. Depending on the IR wavelength used, the output is either a positive, binary-thresholded version of the input (bistable mode) or its linear, negative (self-linearized) mode. This device can also function as a dynamic bistable memory that can retain its internal state without power for times as long as 30 sec.\n\nView details for Web of Science ID A1988M704700014\n\nView details for PubMedID 19745878\n\nAbstract\n\nIt is shown theoretically that optical bistability will exist in a material whose optical absorption is more than linearly proportional to the degree to which the material is excited. No cavity or external feedback is required. The underlying principle of this bistability appears to be a generalization of several previous independent discussions of mirrorless bistabilities in specific physical systems. This bistability and associated differential gain are demonstrated experimentally using a thermal nonlinearity in a GaAs/GaAlAs multiple-quantum-well semiconductor. Theory and experiment show good agreement.\n\nView details for Web of Science ID A1984SP80800006\n\nView details for PubMedID 19721530\n\nAbstract\n\nWe demonstrate an optical-level shifter and a modulator whose transmission varies linearly with drive current, both based on a new, negative-feedback mode of operation of the recently discovered quantum-well self-electro-optic effect device.
