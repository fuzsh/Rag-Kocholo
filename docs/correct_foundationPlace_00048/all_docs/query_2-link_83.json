        "text": "Maxxis 5 weighing controller for precise control of truck scales\n\nThe Maxxis 5 with truck weighing application can control the entire weighing process, including predefined processes for:\n\nFirst and second weighing\n\nControl of traffic lights and barriers\n\nControl of dosing processes for lorry loading\n\nMaterial and order-related receipts, recipe reports, utilisation logs and production statistics can be printed out via a printer or exported to a PC.\n\nThe Maxxis 5 weighing controller is also suitable for tandem scales. Two weighing platforms are connected and the combined weight value is calculated.\n\nto the product\n\nA truck scale is a weighing system that is used to weigh the load of a vehicle. It is mainly used in recycling plants, factories, quarries and agriculture. Generally, a truck scale uses a structured platform made of metal/concrete, solid concrete or solid steel with load cells and a control transmission system to display the total weight of the vehicle and the goods loaded on it.\n\nVarious aspects should be considered when purchasing and using a truck scale. In the recycling industry, for example, the vehicles are generally longer, goods such as stones or paper spill and impair the function of the truck scale. Access and cleaning requirements under the truck scale are therefore important. If the value of the goods to be weighed is high, the requirements for the accuracy of the load cells for the truck scale also increase. In agriculture, on the other hand, the requirements for the width of the vehicles are different and, of course, the requirements for overload protection of the truck scales are high. In companies located near the ocean or sea, for example, there are requirements for water and corrosion protection. In the logistics and warehousing industry, where the truck scales are part of the factory's overall IT system, which is often linked to purchasing, storage and sales systems, there are many vehicle entries and exits, which requires fast measurements and high traceability functions.\n\nAs with most scales, the main central component of a truck scale is the load cell, usually between 4 and 8 load cells, depending on the number of modules on the platform. The load cells are mounted under the lower part of the truck scale platform using a mounting kit. The signal cables of the load cells are connected to the weight indicator via a junction box to display the weight. In addition to these basic elements, the truck scale can be equipped with a second indicator, the so-called weight repeater, depending on the user's needs, a system that ensures that the driver can check that the truck scale is at zero and that he can see his weight when he is standing on the scale. Other devices, such as weighing terminals, can independently control the management and recording of weighing operations.\n\nThe location of a truck scale must be carefully considered: Is the surface strong enough to bear the weight of the scales and the loaded lorry? Does the weighbridge have to cope with traffic in one or both directions? Does the site provide adequate drainage for rainwater? Does the site provide enough space for trucks to enter and exit the truck scale without problems? Is the site large enough to add a new weighbridge if required? Is a waiting area provided so that waiting lorries do not block traffic on the carriageway? You need to know the compressive strength of the soil, frost and water levels at the installation site and make sure that the chosen location is suitable for the installation before you draw up the exact construction plan. The load-bearing capacity under the foundation of the weighbridge varies between 7,300 kg/m2 and 12,200 kg/m2. If the site conditions do not fulfil this requirement, reinforcement must be provided. The foundation of the vehicle bridge must be excavated deeper.\n\nDo not install the device in the vicinity of strong sources of interference, such as post and telecommunications offices, television towers, large transformer stations and high-voltage power lines. Electromagnetic and electrostatic couplings cause interference with the load cell signals transmitted by the transmission cables, and the longer the signal lines, the stronger the interference."
