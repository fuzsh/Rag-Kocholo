Residual impact is still affecting some Microsoft 365 apps and services, and Microsoft 365 engineering are continuing to conduct additional mitigation actions to provide relief. We are continuing to observe an increase in functionality and availability for the remaining impacted scenarios and we're monitoring this closely to ensure we're progressing towards full recovery. Microsoft is continuing to treat this event with the highest possible priority.\n\n‚ö†Ô∏è 19/07/24: Update on Global Microsoft Services Disruption ‚ö†Ô∏è A disruption in Microsoft‚Äôs global services has been reported earlier today. The root cause is currently under investigation, and Microsoft is actively working on mitigation strategies. The outage has had a widespread impact, with reports of service interruptions affecting various sectors, including airlines, media outlets, and financial institutions. Notably, SIMS cloud services, Sky News, and RyanAir are experiencing downtime. Early signs are suggesting the outage is related to Crowdstrike, which is a security product largely used in Microsoft Azure. This may affect inTEC clients but investigation is still underway. If you are a client of inTEC we want to assure you that our team is on standby to provide any assistance you may require during this time. Should you encounter any service disruptions, please do not hesitate to reach out to us by contacting your inTEC Account Manager. Alternatively, please call 0345 565 1767 or email info@intecbusiness.co.uk and we will endeavour to support you promptly. Thank you. #Microsoft #Outage #GlobalOutage #inTECGROUP\n\n‚ö†Ô∏è *GLOBAL MICROSOFT OUTAGE* ‚ö†Ô∏è IT outages are reported across the world, affecting airlines, media, and banks. The cause is not known - but Microsoft says it's taking mitigation action. SIMS cloud, Sky News and RyanAir are confirmed to be offline, so this appears to be a global issue. We are awaiting further information from Microsoft, but currently this appears to be isolated to cloud based patching - however, that is not fully confirmed. If you are an inTEC GROUP client and experience any outage issues, please call 0345 565 1767 or email info@intecbusiness.co.uk and we'll be happy to help.
