        "text": "The Chair in Science and Society of the Rafael del Pino Foundation prepares the report Ten technologies to boost Spain. Under the supervision of Professor Javier García Martínez, the Chair's team drafts an annual document that identifies the ten emerging technologies that offer a competitive advantage to the Spanish economy and society.\n\nThe report Ten technologies to boost Spainis an analysis and prospective work led by the Rafael del Pino Foundation professor Javier García Martínez. The team behind it is made up of Fernando Gomollón Bell and Eugenio Mallol, with editorial coordination by Jordi Sánchez Navas. It is backed by a committee of experts made up of 14 leading figures in science and technology, who contribute their experience and knowledge in various fields.\n\nThis report on ten technologies to give Spain a competitive edge does not seek to disseminate the latest and most striking innovations in the field of research, but rather to recognise those science and technology-based initiatives that are in the process of being incorporated into economic activity, by connecting their innovative nature with a high degree of maturity in their development and application.\n\nThey are currently members of the Committee of Experts:\n\nMaría José Alonso Fernández.

PhD in Chemical Sciences and Master in Business Administration. From 2007 to 2017. Former director of Repsol's R&D and technology division, with global responsibility in this area.\n\nPresentation in Madrid in mid-2021\n\nThe presentation of the report took place on 17 November 2021 in an event held at the Madrid headquarters of the Rafael del Pino Foundation, with the participation of researcher Sonia Contera, Professor of Physics at Oxford University, and Iñaki Berenguer, investor, entrepreneur and founder of companies such as Coverwallet and Pixable, among others.\n\nThe report draws on a long tradition of such documents promoted by leading international organisations and reputable scientific publications. This is the case of the Top ten emerging technologies The World Economic Forum, the World Economic Forum's version of this report, the magazine Scientific American or the selection made each year by MIT with the title 10 breakthrough technologies.\n\nThe report, applied to the specific case of Spanish competitiveness, prepared by the Chair in Science and Society of the Rafael del Pino Foundation, incorporates the experience of its director Javier García Martínez, who is a member of the Committee of Experts that draws up the list of the World Economic Forum and participates in the drafting of the publication that Scientific American dedicates to this subject.\n\nTelemedicine\n\nTelemedicine harnesses digital resources and advances in telecommunications to bring about a leap forward in healthcare systems. Its impact benefits the most disadvantaged sectors, such as the elderly, the vulnerable sick and people living far from urban centres.\n\nFurther information\n\nPhotonics\n\nPhotonics has the potential to transform the telecommunications industry, as well as to revolutionise robotics and automation processes, advanced medicine and wearable technologies and quality control checks in different sectors.\n\nFurther information\n\nGreen hydrogen\n\nSpain can lead the European transition to the hydrogen economy. Our position as a leader in the renewables market guarantees that we will be able to produce green hydrogen in large quantities and at very competitive prices.\n\nFurther information\n\nNeuroscience\n\nMachines that anticipate our thoughts and prevent accidents, neural interfaces that improve our memory and advanced implants capable of curing diseases such as Parkinson's or epilepsy will soon be a reality.\n\nFurther information\n\nMathematics for data processing\n\nSpain leads pioneering initiatives in mathematical research and model development, thanks to the work of universities and the CSIC. However, the importance of mathematics in our economy is still far below that of other European countries.\n\nFurther information\n\nAugmented reality\n\nA commitment to innovation in augmented reality, across all sectors, is a guarantee of success; it will revolutionise healthcare, education, engineering and logistics, as well as transforming activities such as tourism, shopping and leisure.\n\nFurther information\n\nQuick tests\n\nRapid tests could revolutionise the way we diagnose diseases. According to the WHO, these tests work without the complexity of a testing laboratory, give results within minutes and are easy to use, so they also do not require the intervention of medical professionals.\n\nFurther information\n\nSupercomputing\n\nSupercomputing is a technology that has enabled revolutionary breakthroughs. The development of new, even more powerful computers will transform almost every industrial sector, from the development of new pharmaceuticals and connected health systems to the creation of more efficient manufacturing processes and more sustainable technologies.\n\nFurther information\n\nPrecision farming\n\nThanks to satellites, drones, autonomous machinery and artificial intelligence, precision agriculture will be able to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, maximise resource efficiency and crop sustainability.\n\nFurther information\n\nNanomedicine\n\nThe applications of nanotechnology in medicine include diagnosis, treatment, reduction of side effects and even the enormous potential to fight more effectively against infectious organisms such as SARS-CoV-2 or antibiotic-resistant bacteria. For years, Spain has led innovation in the field of nanomedicine. Now...\n\nFurther information\n\nDownloads:"
