        "text": "PALO ALTO, Calif., April 28 /PRNewswire/ -- Aricent®, a global innovation, technology and services company focused exclusively on communications, today announced that Nepal Telecom, Nepal's largest and most prolific telecom operator, has awarded the company a three year systems integration contract to provide Convergent Mediation and Convergent Interconnect Billing solutions that enable a wide range of next-generation communication services.\n\nFollowing on the heels of Aricent's announcement of its Innovation Lab in support of systems integration for service providers, Aricent will act as the primary systems integrator for Convergent Mediation and Interconnect solutions. As a turnkey implementation provider offering supply, delivery, installation and commissioning, Aricent will integrate systems, which together enable next-generation product and service offerings for both pre-paid and post-paid customers. In support of the agreement, Aricent will be implementing and integrating its proven and broadly deployed Active Mediation System, in conjunction with Intec's market-leading InterconnecT software. The engagement also includes post-deployment managed services in support of the converged solution.\n\nNepal Telecom provides a wide range of telecom services to its existing five million customers in a variety of networks such as Fixed, GSM, CDMA and Data. The company's customer base is estimated to grow to over nine million subscribers in the next three years.\n\n\"As the leading telecom service provider in Nepal, we strive to bring the best experience to our customers,\" said Amar Nath Singh, managing director of Nepal Telecom. \"We are confident that Aricent's solution will allow us to create a unified mediation platform as well as a single interconnect system for our entire network. This will also simplify billing and operational parameters for our customers, and allow us to provide them with world-class capabilities and technologies, including high speed next-gen networks and services.\"\n\n\"We are thrilled to partner with Nepal Telecom and help them deliver an innovative, scalable subscriber experience for their customers,\" said Sanjay Dhawan, president and COO at Aricent. \"We've had the privilege of working with some of the largest network operators in the world and we are pleased to add Nepal Telecom to our roster of service provider stars.\"\n\nThe broad compatibility of Aricent's solution across different networks and systems will pioneer operational convergence within Nepal Telecom by enabling the operator to create a common, unified mediation platform and a single interconnect system for the entire network. The solution has the potential to reduce total cost of ownership and minimize revenue leakage.\n\n\"Intec's market-leading InterconnecT software is proven with operators of all sizes and in numerous markets, worldwide,\" said Graeme Paynter, vice president for Intec, Asia Pacific. \"InterconnecT continues to demonstrate a level of functionality and performance that simply cannot be matched and we look forward to working with Aricent in helping Nepal Telecom enjoy unrivalled ROI and exceptional operational savings.\"\n\nAricent's user friendly Active Mediation System supports real-time data collection and charging for both pre-paid and post-paid services and can process billions of Call Detail Records (CDRs) and Usage Data Records (UDRs). It allows efficient management of services and billing for next generation converged networks, thus improving revenue realization. The intuitive Web-based Graphical User Interface (GUI) ensures easy management, while the ready to use plug-in adaptors reduce integration time for new and innovative service launches. It is coupled with the InterconnecT System – an out-of-the-box solution supporting interconnection needs of fixed, mobile and content customers for both national and international operations. The system enables operators to optimize cash flow by equipping them to negotiate agreements that facilitate rapid receipt of revenue and define rates based on traffic volumes while supporting a comprehensive set of discounting scenarios.\n\nAricent's telecommunications system integration practice delivers advanced and reliable Business Support Systems and Operations Support Systems (BSS/OSS) solutions, and in general, these accelerate the launch of new services, enhance customer experience, improve connectivity and ensure efficient partner settlement and organizational level data consolidation. Particularly, in case of the project with Nepal Telecom, the Convergent Mediation and Convergent Interconnect Billing solutions will be used for its upcoming Convergent Billing System.\n\nAbout Aricent\n\nAricent is a global innovation, technology and services company focused exclusively on communications.
