Here are some of the services we offer.\n\nStep-free access\n\nAll the floors in Wellcome, including the entrance, have step-free access.\n\nAccessible toilets\n\nThere are accessible toilets on every floor.

We’re open between 09:00 and 17:00, Monday to Friday.\n\nWe aim to maintain high standards at all times, and we’re keen to improve what we do and how we do it. We accept complaints and other feedback about anything that we do or are connected with.\n\nIf you make a complaint to us, we will aim to resolve the complaint to your satisfaction and ours.\n\nWe have separate complaint processes for:\n\nour normal operations\n\nproperties that we are directly responsible for.\n\nThese are set out below.\n\nIf you have a general query or question, please contact us by submitting a general enquiry form. If your question is related to funding, please email fundingsupport@wellcome.org.\n\nGeneral complaints process\n\nThis applies to all complaints against Wellcome except properties that we are directly responsible for.\n\nIf you’ve been dealing with someone at Wellcome already, you can send your complaint directly to them.\n\nIf you prefer, you can email talktous@wellcome.org.\n\nStage 1 Your complaint will be investigated and responded to by an appropriate member of our staff. Who this is will depend on what the complaint is about.\n\nWe aim to resolve all complaints, to your satisfaction and ours, at Stage 1.\n\nStage 2 If you’re not satisfied with the response at Stage 1, we may refer your complaint to a member of our Executive team to investigate further and respond to you.\n\nStage 3 If you’re not satisfied with the response at Stage 2, and if the Executive team member handling the complaint thinks it is serious enough, they may refer it to Wellcome’s Director for further review. The Director’s decision will be final.\n\nComplaints about grants\n\nIf your complaint is about how a grant was handled or any aspect of our application process, please be aware that any funding decision is final and we cannot reconsider it as part of the complaint process.\n\nComplaints about property\n\nIf you have a complaint relating to management of a property that we’re directly responsible for, you should follow this process.\n\nStage 1 Put your complaint in writing as soon as possible after the incident and send it by post or email to the manager responsible for the property. If you don’t know which manager is responsible, send it to propertycomplaints@wellcome.org and we will either forward it to the relevant property manager or give you their contact details.\n\nYou will need to follow the property manager’s complaints procedure to its conclusion before you raise a complaint directly with us.\n\nStage 2 If you have completed the property manager’s procedure and you are not satisfied with the result, you can ask for the decision to be referred to Wellcome’s property investment team for review. In most cases this will be the final stage.\n\nIf we receive a complaint that hasn’t already been through Stage 1, we may refer it back to that stage.\n\nStage 3 If the property investment team thinks that the complaint is serious enough, it may be referred to a managing partner of Investments for review. Their decision will be final.\n\nThis process doesn’t apply if:\n\nyou are asking for information\n\nyou are asking to amend records\n\nthere are legal proceedings in process.\n\nIn these cases, you should contact the property manager with any queries.\n\nOur approach to complaints\n\nWe aim to respond quickly and politely, and to give fair and reasonable responses. We expect complaints to be made in the same spirit.\n\nIf a complaint is unreasonable, or if the person making it acts unreasonably, we may depart from our usual complaint processes. Unreasonable behaviour might include excessive communication, harassment of staff, abuse and refusal to acknowledge communications.\n\nWe will not respond to complaints that constitute bullying and harassment, including messages that are abusive or threatening, and any such messages may be reported.\n\nWe may vary our complaint processes if we think it appropriate, for example to escalate a particular complaint to a later stage.\n\nComplaints are confidential but we may, if necessary, involve third parties to understand the issues and investigate fully.\n\nWe record all serious complaints. We use their outcomes to monitor the performance of our service providers and identify where we can make improvements.\n\nIf we receive complaints through any other channels, we will still use the same processes to handle them."
