        "text": "Engineering Science is a profession that involves the application of different scientific principles and the associated mathematics that underlie engineering. It integrates engineering, biological, chemical, mathematical and physical sciences with the arts, humanities, social sciences and professions to face the most demanding challenges and promote the well-being of the global society.\n\nThat said, engineering is applied in order to merge multidisciplinary resources to propose and develop innovative and lasting solutions, and transform the latest scientific discoveries to allow new technologies. Engineering scientists research, develop and design new materials, devices, sensors and processes for a wide range of applications.\n\nIn the third year of the course, students take general subjects of various engineering professions in order to merge their multidisciplinary resources. While, in the fourth year, they concentrate on an area of ​​interest, in order to propose and develop innovative and lasting solutions, to transform the latest scientific discoveries, giving way to new technologies.\n\n\"INTEC / PSU: 2 + 2\" starts from August of 2009, with the possibility of becoming part of program every August (1). Students admitted to the programs included in the \"2 + 2\" will have an automatic provisional admission in PSU. During their training cycle at INTEC, they will receive the necessary advice and follow-up to comply with the requirements demanded by this university. Upon successful completion of the first two years, they will automatically enter the chosen career. The academic title will be issued by Penn State University and the Technological Institute of Santo Domingo (INTEC)\n\nNotes: (1) Students who enter in August will be assured to take 2 years in INTEC and 2 years in PSU. However, students who enter the institution outside of this date are not guaranteed this period of stay; it will vary according to the terms of the foreign university."
