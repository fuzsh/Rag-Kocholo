Intec's combined solutions will help to overcome the technical difficulties currently preventing state-owned SOTELMA from supporting interconnection network activity with Mali's recently launched new GSM mobile operator.\n\nSOTELMA will use InterconnecT ITU to seamlessly handle domestic interconnect and international settlements generated from the second operator and future intercarrier partners in Mali. The solution will also offer full compliance with the standards imposed by the International Telecommunications Union (ITU) and will be used to handle international settlements with all international operators that SOTELMA is interconnected with around the globe.\n\nInter-mediatE will enable SOTELMA to acquire information on calls being provided over its network for use in producing accurate interconnect invoices and traffic statements. This will be achieved by feeding data into the existing retail and InterconnecT billing systems.\n\n- With the liberalisation of the market SOTELMA decided to gain the capability to support interconnectivity between operators through the use of quick and efficient billing systems, explains Sheik Sidi-Mohamed Nimaga, CEO of SOTELMA.\n\n- At present we do not have the means to manage interconnection fees for calls generated from customers using the second GSM's mobile services, he adds. \"The only efficient way to solve this problem is to implement effective OSS systems such as Intec's InterconnecT ITU and Inter-mediatE.\"\n\nAccording to Mr Nimaga, \"these solutions, which have been proposed by Intec Telecom Systems, were selected following an Open Request For Proposal for their performance in supporting Call Detail Records (CDRs), summarising traffic data and creating accurate billing information for use in checking accounts between operators-all with total ease and complete serenity.\"\n\nThis agreement increases Intec's customer base in Africa, which already includes Maroc Telecom, Cell C Mobile, Telkom South Africa, Telecom Egypt, M-Tel Nigeria, Orange Madagascar, Orange Réunion Island and Senegal's Sonatel.\n\nBy Balancing Act staff writer\n\n© afrol News / Balancing Act\n\n- Create an e-mail alert for Mali news\n\n- Create an e-mail alert for Technology news\n\nTweet Printable version\n\nOn the Afrol News front page now\n\nRwanda\n\nRwanda succeeds including citizens in formal financial sector\n\nafrol News - It is called \"financial inclusion\", and it is a key government policy in Rwanda.
