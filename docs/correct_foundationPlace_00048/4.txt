A leading supplier of business and operations support systems to the global telecoms industry, Intec Telecoms says its revenue and earnings are substantially ahead of the same period last year and in line with market expectations.

Notable competitive wins include VimpelCom, the Carphone Warehouse and a major US operator.

Intec Telecom has also announced that China Netcom has gone live with the company’s convergent mediation software.

The first phase of the project will generate 40 million call detail records per day and is expected to grow to more than three times its size when a later phase is implemented.

Intec Telecom’s chief executive officer Kevin Adams said: “The multi-product, multi-million pound contract wins we are achieving and our growing participation in leading edge projects indicate the continuing momentum and potential of the business.

“Intec has an unmatched product range, a substantial and proven global delivery capability and broad customer base.

“These are vital assets in our quest for continued growth.”
