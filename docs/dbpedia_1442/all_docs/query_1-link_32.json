        "text": "Nomination Guidelines\n\nNomination dossiers must have at least 3 and not more than 5 letters of support documenting the nominee’s contributions to and impact on geography in the specific Honors category for which they are being nominated, and must also include the candidate’s CV. Efforts to improve diversity, equity, and inclusion in the discipline need to be addressed in the nomination letters. Self-nominations are allowed, but must include the required letters of support.\n\nNomination dossiers should be submitted by the deadline by completing the online application form. Please gather all required supporting documents before completing the online application. The Application Form will require you to upload all supporting documents before being able to complete your submission. You cannot save a partially completed form and return to it later, so it is important to have all materials ready before accessing the online Application Form. For questions, please reach out to grantsawards@aag.org.\n\nThe nominations are reviewed by the AAG Honors Committee, comprised of at least two members who have previously received AAG Honors. A final slate of nominees is presented to the AAG Council at its annual Fall meeting. The names put forward to the Council are accompanied by an award citation indicating the contribution which forms the basis of the proposed award. The final decision for awarding AAG Honors rests with the Council.\n\nNominations for these awards are solicited in late spring and announcements are published in the AAG Newsletter and on the AAG’s social media platforms, along with electronic distribution to specialty and affinity groups, department chairs, all AAG members, and other interested parties.\n\nIn addition, AAG Councilors and members of the AAG Honors Committee may also share the call for nominations and encourage submissions to the AAG Honors program. AAG Honors Committee members are not allowed to submit nominations for AAG Honors and must recuse themselves from deliberations on a candidate they may have close and active professional or personal ties to (some examples: departmental colleague; research, fieldwork or grants collaborator; mentor/mentee; supervisor or supervisee; spouse or domestic partner, etc.).\n\nIn making a nomination, please be aware that under current guidelines:\n\nNo more than eight individuals may be awarded AAG Honors in a single year. However, depending on the pool of nominees, fewer than eight awards are sometimes made.\n\nNormally only one award is made annually in each category, although more than one is permitted. However, there is no requirement to make an award in every category if there are insufficient nominations.\n\nNominees must be AAG members if they are residents of the United States; if they reside elsewhere, the membership requirement is waived. In some cases, professionals from other disciplines or professions are eligible for consideration.\n\nNominations of a group of individuals for an AAG Honors are allowed if the achievements of the group clearly demonstrate outstanding accomplishments in one of the following areas: research & scholarship, teaching, education, service to the discipline, public service outside academe. All individuals in the group being nominated must be eligible under these eligibility criteria. Groups of individuals are not eligible for the AAG Lifetime Achievement Honors.\n\nPrevious AAG honorees (see list below) may be nominated for a second AAG honor in the same category but, if nominated again, the nomination must be for distinction achieved since their first award.\n\nThe contributions of some nominees may span two or more of the award categories. In this situation, nominators may suggest more than one category for the award. The final decision of award category rests, however, with the AAG Council.\n\nNo more than one AAG Honors can be awarded posthumously in any given year in any Honors category, while still not exceeding the total maximum of eight Honors per year.\n\nNomination dossiers will be automatically carried forward for two years after the initial nomination, unless the nominee or the nominator withdraws the nominee from consideration, or unless the nomination is judged not to meet the minimum requirements for AAG Honors.\n\nThe AAG strongly encourages nominators and the Honors Committee to consider broad and inclusive criteria for AAG Honors nominations and selections. Such criteria can include (but are not limited to): race, age, religion, creed, color, ancestry, citizenship, national or ethnic origin, disability, military or veteran status, sex, gender identity or expression, sexual orientation, but also institutional diversity (i.e., teaching institutions, Historically Black Colleges and Universities, tribal institutions, research institutions, Associates’ degree-granting programs, private or public sector organizations, non-profit organizations, etc.).\n\nAs with all other AAG awards, eligibility also rests on the nominee being in compliance with the AAG Professional Conduct Policy. Nominations may be revoked, and the AAG Honor may also be revoked for any candidate or AAG Honoree who is found in violation of the AAG’s Professional Conduct Policy.\n\nAAG Honors Recipients\n\n2024\n\nJennifer Collins, Distinguished Scholarship Honors; Patricia Lopez, Distinguished Teaching Honors; Rafael de Miguel Gonzalez, Gilbert Grosvenor Honors for Geographic Education; Cindi Katz, Lifetime Achievement Honors\n\n2023\n\nLi An, Geraldine Pratt, Distinguished Scholarship Honors; John Strait and Ava Fujimoto-Strait, Distinguished Teaching Honors; David R.
