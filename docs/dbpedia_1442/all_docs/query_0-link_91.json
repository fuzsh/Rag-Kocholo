For example, chronic diseases, many of which are preventable, account for more than 50% of all deaths each year (King et al. 2008). Almost half of all adults have at least one chronic illness (Wu and Green 2000). Obesity, a major risk factor for numerous health conditions, has grown to epidemic proportions in the United States (Ogden et al. 2007, 2008): one-third of all adults and almost one-fifth of people 6–19 years old are obese. Improvement in health has been inconsistent, and major disparities in health associated with socioeconomic circumstances, race, and ethnicity persist (Williams et al. 2010).\n\nDespite major medical advances and large health expenditures, many Americans are unable to achieve their full health potential; this affects not only the quality and duration of their lives but their ability to be engaged and productive members of society. Poor health also has important economic implications—for lost productivity and for the costs of diagnosing and treating chronic conditions. Those costs affect individuals, communities, and society at large (WHO 2001; Hammitt 2007; Mackenbach et al. 2007). For example, costs for medical care have mushroomed both in amount and as a portion of the U.S. GDP because of the increases in medical care itself, the increases in use of the health-care system, the aging of the population, and the higher rates of chronic diseases. Health-care spending accounted for 7% of the U.S. GDP in 1970 and 16% of it in 2008 (CMS 2011); it is projected to be close to 20% by 2019 (CMS 2010), and this projection does not take into account the substantial increases in morbidity and mortality that will result from the obesity and diabetes epidemics. Diabetes alone accounted for $174 billion in health-care costs in the United States in 2007; diabetes incidence is expected to increase from 7 per 1,000 to 15 per 1,000 by 2050 and diabetes prevalence from 14% to 21% by 2050 and in some scenarios up to 33% (Boyle et al 2010). Thus, the consequences of not preventing chronic health conditions are large, not only in years of healthy life lost but in monetary costs.\n\nThere is growing recognition among scientists, communities, and policy-makers that health is affected by an array of factors that operate on multiple levels and throughout a person’s lifetime (Adler and Stewart 2010). Although the importance of access to and quality of health care is well recognized, prevention is key. Disease prevention and health promotion require addressing a much broader set of factors and policies that shape health-related behaviors in addition to trying to modify biologic processes specifically related to diseases. Efforts to improve early detection and treatment of diseases through improved access to high-quality medical care must be complemented by approaches that address the underlying or root causes of disease. The underlying causes include the factors that shape the conditions in which people are born, grow, live, work, and age, and the policies that affect them. Those factors and their implications for health have been highlighted in a number of recent reports (see, for example, WHO 2002; CSDH 2008; RWJF 2009).\n\nThe root causes that have been identified indicate that many policies or programs thought to be unrelated to health may have important health consequences. Indeed, it has been argued that major health problems, such as the obesity epidemic and its associated health and monetary costs, are essentially unintended consequences of various social and policy factors related, for example, to the mass production and distribution of energy-dense foods (Ledikwe et al. 2006; Mendoza et al. 2007; Wang et al. 2008) and the engineering of physical activity out of daily life through changes in how transportation is organized and how neighborhoods are designed and built (Gordon-Larsen et al. 2005; Li et al. 2008; Frank and Kavage 2009; Fitzhugh et al. 2010). Such policy and planning decisions have powerful implications for individual behaviors and public health. The prevention of today’s major health problems requires understanding and intervention to affect the root causes of ill health and the policies that shape and affect the root causes. To address them effectively, a better understanding of the possible health consequences of proposed policies and planning decisions as they are being developed is needed so that adverse health effects can be anticipated and minimized and health benefits maximized.\n\nIn summary, the health implications of decisions need to be considered explicitly not only to prevent harm but to promote health. Indeed, it can be argued that major improvements in the health of the U.S. public cannot be achieved without attention to the root causes of ill health and to the policies and programs that affect them. Furthermore, many root causes of ill health are common to the entire U.S. population, so interventions that address them can have broad-based impacts that benefit both high-risk groups and the general public.\n\nCONCLUSIONS\n\nAs a society, we routinely make decisions and implement a variety of policies, programs, and strategies without knowledge of their health implications. But those actions could substantially affect the health of the population and health disparities. The health consequences can have economic and social costs, which can have multiplying and cumulative effects. Identifying the potential effects in advance is fundamental for disease prevention and could have important consequences for trends in diseases and for social inequalities in a wide variety of health outcomes.\n\nBy tackling issues that other policy-analysis tools do not systematically incorporate or address, HIA has both a more expansive vision and a number of barriers to overcome to be accepted as a decision-making tool. Thus, it holds great potential but also presents a number of challenges. The following chapters discuss the key elements of HIA, review the status of HIA, and propose ways to improve the quality and utility of HIA in the future."
