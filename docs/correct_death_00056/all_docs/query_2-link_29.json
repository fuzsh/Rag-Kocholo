        "text": "(1943–93). American tennis player Arthur Ashe won the men’s singles title at the United States Open championship in 1968, becoming the first African American man to win a Grand Slam event, one of the four major tournaments in tennis. Ashe was also a noted social activist.\n\nArthur Robert Ashe, Jr., was born on July 10, 1943, in Richmond, Virginia. He grew up in a segregated Richmond, leading a quiet childhood with his mother, Mattie, who died suddenly when he was 6 years old. He exhibited a talent for tennis, and he was discovered at age 10 by an African American physician who trained tennis players in his spare time. Ashe eventually won a tennis scholarship to the University of California at Los Angeles (UCLA).\n\nAt UCLA he led the tennis team to the National Collegiate Athletic Association tennis championship. In 1963 Ashe broke the color barrier in tennis when he became the first African American selected to represent the United States as a member of the Davis Cup team. From 1963 to 1978, he compiled a 27–5 record as a Davis Cup singles player. In 1965 he won the intercollegiate singles and doubles titles. He graduated from UCLA in 1966 with a bachelor’s degree in business administration.\n\nAshe followed his 1968 U.S. Open win with the men’s singles title at the Australian Open in 1970. His powerful serves, stunning backhand, and hard-hit, topspin ground strokes helped bedevil his opponents. In the 1975 Wimbledon championship, Ashe calmly defeated the heavily favored Jimmy Connors to win the men’s singles title.\n\nAshe was a poised and eloquent spokesman for effecting social change both on and off the court. In 1973, he was finally granted a visa to travel to South Africa after three previous attempts, and he became the first African American to reach the final of the South African Open. Although the winnings from his 51 tournament titles and numerous other professional victories in addition to his product endorsements made Ashe a millionaire, his wealth did not impede his social activism. He was very supportive of the antiapartheid movement in South Africa; he helped raise awareness about the plight of inner-city children and Haitian refugees in the United States; and he was forceful in his efforts to educate the public about AIDS, the disease that claimed his life.\n\nAshe retired from professional tennis in 1980, but he did not end his active involvement in the sport. He served as a non-playing captain of the Davis Cup team from 1981 to 1985, during which time the United States won championships in 1981 and 1982. In 1985 Ashe was inducted into the International Tennis Hall of Fame. He published an autobiography, Off the Court (1981), and the three-volume A Hard Road to Glory: A History of the African-American Athlete (1988). Ashe also received numerous honorary doctorates.\n\nIn 1979, after having ranked among the top ten players for 15 years, Ashe was stricken with the first of three heart attacks. He underwent quadruple bypass surgery in 1979 and double bypass surgery in 1983. It was reportedly through a transfusion during his second surgery that he contracted the virus that causes AIDS. In 1988, he suffered a severe bacterial infection in his head, and blood work revealed that he had AIDS. Ashe announced his condition to the public in April 1992 after he learned that a newspaper was preparing a scoop. Part of his legacy was the organization of the Arthur Ashe Foundation for the Defeat of AIDS. Ashe died on February 6, 1993, in New York, New York."
