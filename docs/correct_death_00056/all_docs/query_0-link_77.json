        "text": "Stadium History | Transportation & Parking | Seating Options | Rules & Guidelines | Food & Beverages\n\nArthur Ashe Stadium History\n\nArthur Ashe Stadium is named after legendary tennis player Arthur Robert Ashe, Jr. Born in Richmond, Virginia, Ashe was the winner of the inaugural 1968 US Open — the first in which professionals could compete. By 1975, he was ranked the No. 1 tennis player in the United States. He passed away in New York in February 1993.\n\nLocated at Flushing Meadows-Corona Park in Queens, New York, Arthur Ashe Stadium opened in 1997 as part of the USTA Billie Jean King National Tennis Center. When Arthur Ashe Stadium opened, it replaced Louis Armstrong Stadium as the main tennis facility in the park. The stadium opened by hosting the US Open and Grammy winner Whitney Houston, who sang “One Moment in Time” during the inauguration ceremonies as a tribute to the late Arthur Ashe. The first official tennis match that was played on the court was at the 1997 US Open, when Thailand’s Tamarine Tanasugarn beat Chanda Rubin from the United States in two sets.\n\nWhen it opened in 1997, the stadium was originally built without a roof, but after years of event delays due to weather, a lightweight retractable roof was completed in 2016. With a capacity of 23,771, Arthur Ashe Stadium is the largest tennis stadium in the world. The stadium features a bronze statue of the tennis player Arthur Robert Ashe, Jr. sculpted by Eric Fischl. Titled “Soul in Flight” and sponsored by the USTA, the statue features Ashe standing tall with his left arm pointing up. It’s inscribed with a quote from Ashe that reads: “From what we get, we can make a living; what we give, however, makes a life.”\n\nIs Arthur Ashe Stadium used for anything other than US Open?\n\nOutside of the US Open, the indoor and outdoor courts of the stadium are open to the public during the rest of the year. Other annual events held at the center are rare, but include the Eastern Wheelchair Tennis Championships and the Mayor’s Cup high school tennis championships.\n\nThe stadium has also hosted the occasional event such as the first-ever outdoor regular season WNBA game in 2008, the Fortnite World Cup esports tournament in 2019, and All Elite Wrestling in 2021.\n\nGetting to and Parking at Arthur Ashe Stadium\n\nGetting There by Car\n\nIf you’re traveling by car to the US Open, putting USTA Billie Jean King National Tennis Center into your GPS will get you there.
