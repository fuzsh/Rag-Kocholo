        "text": "African American History\n\nI was camping with my brothers when Arthur Ashe beat Jimmy Connors in Wimbledon, the most famous of all tennis tournaments. We could not even watch the match on television, though we had a small black and white television with poor reception. We also had a transistor radio.\n\nMost importantly, Arthur Ashe, an African American man, had won the Men's Singles Championship at Wimbledon in England. He was the first African American man to win the title. It also didn’t hurt that he beat Jimmy Connors, who we all did not like much.\n\nArthur Ashe was our hero but especially my hero. I played tennis as a young boy in Washington, D.C. I learned the sport from Roumainia Peters Walker, one of the two legendary Walker sisters. Walker ran a tennis camp in Washington D.C. at Rose Park Recreation Center and tennis courts in the summer. Ashe even came to visit the camp one year to much fanfare."
