        "text": "The Arthur Ashe Monument is at the intersection of Monument Avenue and Roseneath Avenue, and is located at the western end of the line of monuments. The Monument Avenue Commission circulated background material on it for a public forum in August, 2017:1\n\nDate Conceived: In 1992, DiPascuale discussed the concept with Arthur Ashe. Upon Ashes death on February 6, 1993, the Arthur Ashe Monument Committee was formed.\n\nDate Erected: July 10, 1996\n\nLocation: Intersection of Monument Avenue and Roseneath Avenue\n\nSculptor: Paul DiPascuale\n\nOrganizers: Paul DiPascuale and Arthur Ashe monument committee\n\nDescription: The 12 bronze statue stands on a 12 pedestal and is located at the intersection of Monument Avenue and Roseneath Avenue at edge of the historic district. Ashe is dressed in athletic clothes and holds a tennis racket in his left hand which is outstretched. In his right hand, held higher than his left, is a stack of books. At his feet are four children looking up at him each with one hand outstretched. The granite cylindrical base is inscribed on the east side with ARTHUR R. ASHE , JR. / 1943-1993 / World Champion, Author, Humanitarian founder of Virginia Heroes , Incorporated / Native of Richmond, Virginia / This monument was placed at Monument Avenue and Roseneath Road on July 10, 1996 to inspire people and children of all nationalities. The West side (front) has inscribed a quote from Hebrews 12:1 Since we are surrounded by so great a cloud of witness, let us lay aside every weight, and the sin which so easily ensnares us, and let us run with endurance the race that is set before us.\n\nBeginning in 1993 Richmond had a heated and on-going public argument about the placement and artistic quality of the statue. People across Virginia weighed in with their thoughts of the appropriateness of Ashe sharing Monument Avenue with the Confederate generals. Others welcomed the idea of all people being represented on the citys impressive avenue.\n\nConfederate Monuments in Virginia\n\nHistory-Oriented Tourism\n\nMonument Avenue in Richmond\n\n- Robert E.
