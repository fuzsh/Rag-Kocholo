        "text": "popular name: Tony Conigliaro\n\ndate_of_death: February 24, 1990\n\nage: 45\n\ncause_of_death: Pneumonia and kidney failure\n\nclaim_to_fame: Sports\n\nbest_know_for: Tony C was a phenomenal baseball player who, in his first at bat for the Boston Red Sox hit a towering home run on the first pitch. During his 1964 rookie season, Conigliaro batted .290 with 24 home runs and 52 RBI in 111 games. At the age of 22, at age 22, he not only reached a career total of 100 home runs, but attained that milestone at the youngest age for an American League player. Sadly his promising career was derailed by a fastball to the face that left him with debilitating injuries.\n\npopular name: Joe Dugan\n\ndate_of_death: July 7, 1982\n\nage: 85\n\ncause_of_death: Pneumonia following a stroke\n\nclaim_to_fame: Sports\n\nbest_know_for: After a slow start with Connie Mack's Philadelphia Athletics baseball team, Jumping Joe Dugan eventually made his way to the fabled New York Yankees where he developed into one of the greatest defensive third baseman and played in five World Series with the Yankees. Despite his solid record, he never made it into the Baseball Hall of Fame.\n\npopular name: Junior Seau\n\ndate_of_death: May 2, 2012\n\nage: 43\n\ncause_of_death: Self-inflicted gunshot wound to the chest\n\nclaim_to_fame: Sports\n\nbest_know_for: For 20 seasons—an eternity for a professional football player—there were few better linebackers in the NFL than Junior Seau. Strong, swift, and imbued with an fanatical work ethic, Seau terrorized opposing offenses so much that they largely avoided him, preferring to take their chances against his teammates. During his career with the San Diego Chargers, Miami Dolphins, and New England Patriots, Seau was selected to 12 Pro Bowl teams and was an First-Team All Pro six times. As he walked away from the game at the end of the 2009 season, there was no question that Seau would be inducted into the Pro Football Hall of Fame. Sadly he was suffering from chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE), a degenerative brain disease from all violent and jarring hits his body and his head were subjected to during all the years in football beginning in junior high school and ending after 20 years in the National Football League. Consequently he took his own life at his home in Oceanside, California."
