        "text": "The death Saturday of tennis legend Arthur Ashe stunned the sports world, which paid tribute to his achievements on and off the court.\n\nAshe, the first black to win Wimbledon, died Saturday of pneumonia resulting from AIDS, 10 months after he revealed he had the disease.\n\nSpectators at the heavyweight title fight between champion Riddick Bowe and Michael Dokes at New York's Madison Square Garden stood in silence in Ashe's memory as the timekeeper rang the ring bell for the tennis star's final 10-count.\n\nBefore the match between Jimmy Connors and Brad Gilbert in the Volvo tournament at San Francisco, the crowd at the Bill Graham Civic Auditorium stood for a moment of silence in honor of Ashe.\n\nAshe admitted at a news conference April 8, 1992, that rumors he had AIDS were true. He said he felt hounded by the news media into admitting his infection.\n\nMagic Johnson, who retired from the Los Angeles Lakers in 1991 after learning he was HIV positive, said Saturday was a sad day for the world.\n\n\"Not only was Arthur a leading figure and pioneer for minorities in sports and business, but also in the fight against HIV and AIDS,\" Johnson said in a statement. \"He was one of the best men of his generation, and his loss is a loss for all of us. If one can look for hope, however, on this very sad occasion, it is that this is yet another compelling reminder of just how important it is to find a cure for this horrible disease. My prayers and those of my wife, Cookie, are with Arthur's family.\"\n\nFormer tennis star Billie Jean King, a crusader for women's rights, remembered Ashe as a crusader and pioneer for the rights of blacks and AIDS awareness.\n\n\"Arthur always said that it was tougher being a black man than having AIDS,\" said King, holder of 20 Wimbledon titles. \"We talked about it a lot. We had a lot of good talks. Arthur rarely revealed himself emotionally before he had AIDS. I think after he had AIDS he opened up more. He became a lot warmer person. He would hug and kiss people more, which was never his nature.\"\n\nShe thought Ashe's desire to help others kept him alive.\n\n\"He accomplished so much in his life. His schedule was so busy. He was always going and doing, and I think that kept him alive longer.\"\n\nGilbert L. Carter, a childhood schoolmate of Ashe who is now Richmond's (Va.)deputy parks director, said he and Ashe met last month to discuss building a hall of fame for black athletes.\n\n\"We were all kind of hoping he had a little bit more time,\" Carter said. \"I know there were quite a few things he still felt he had to do.\"\n\nHarold Solomon, a close friend of Ashe and one of the final eight players in the Grand Prix Masters in 1978, said the tennis star was an inspiration on and off the court.\n\n\"I was with him on one of his last trips to South Africa and I saw what he saw and how it affected him. Then he came back and he took a stand against apartheid when it was not the vogue thing to do and that spoke a lot for him.\"\n\n\"A great leader has been taken away,\" said tennis player Tim Mayotte, a 1981 Wimbledon semifinalist once ranked seventh in the world. \"It's a tragic moment. For someone to come through this much adversity is a real inspiration.\"\n\nMayotte, now a TV commentator, said in San Francisco: \"The sport has lost a great leader, a great human being and a great teacher. Arthur showed such courage in the face of adversity, first in dealing with racism on the tour and then in handling his disease.\"\n\nAshe had said the happiest moment of his life was not winning Wimbledon in 1975 but when anti-apartheid political prisoner Nelson Mandela was freed from jail Feb. 11, 1990.\n\n\"I had known for a long, long time since he had it,\" said Charlie Pasarell, Ashe's roommate at UCLA and Davis Cup partner. \"He had some bad moments, some bad days. He talked openly to me about it. I got used to seeing him in good and bad moments. I can't tell you how many times I've had that bad dream about this. I knew this day would come, but it's so hard \"\n\n_ Information from the Associated Press, the Washington Post and Reuters was used in this report.\n\nAIDS victims\n\nHere are some of the athletes who have died of AIDS:\n\n1986: JERRY SMITH _ All-Pro tight end for the Washington Redskins from 1965-77. Was first pro athlete known to have died of AIDS. Oct. 15, age 43.\n\n1987: THOMAS WADDELL _ Member of U.S. decathlon team in 1968 Mexico City Olympics.
