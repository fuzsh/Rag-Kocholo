They won the Boys 17-18 and Boys 10 and under categories, respectively. He along with the other winners, ranging in ages from 10 to 18, were selected out of close to 2,600 entries submitted last month. Each winner received a New York City travel package from Aug. 22-24.\n\nNoland and Mahankali received a two-night stay at the Grand Hyatt 42nd Street in New York City for themselves and a parent/legal guardian. The trip also included tickets to New York’s critically-acclaimed theatrical show “The Ride,\" a Circle Line Liberty Cruise sightseeing tour, and VIP status in the President’s Box during the 2014 Arthur Ashe Kids’ Day presented by Hess. The weekend wrapped up with an awards luncheon, hosted by former New York City Mayor and USTA board member David Dinkins, where the winners will received an honorary plaque.\n\nA member of Harlem Junior Tennis and Education Program (HJTEP), Noland attends Regis High School on the Upper East Side. In addition to playing tennis, he also participates in the New York City Children's Chorus. Mahankali is entering sixth grade at Nathaniel Hawthorne Middle School in Queens, and is a member of New York Junior Tennis and Learning (NYJTL). In addition to playing tennis, Mahankali is a member of his school’s chorus and drama club.\n\nTo enter the contest, children were asked to write an essay of 350 words or less, responding to a specific question about Arthur Ashe and his great accomplishments. This year’s question asked: “Arthur Ashe used his time and skills to impact others. How have you used your time and skills learned through tennis and educational programming to impact the lives of those around you?” A USTA sub-committee selected the winning essays based on knowledge of Arthur Ashe, message clarity and writing style.\n\n\"The USTA Foundation is proud of this year’s Arthur Ashe Essay contest winners,\" said Dan Faber, executive director of the USTA Foundation. “This is a particularly exciting year for the foundation, as we have joined with the NJTL network. It’s a unique opportunity for us to continue supporting students who are truly deserving of this recognition. Their response to this year’s question is truly profound, and reflects the ideals and inspiration behind Arthur Ashe’s leadership and legacy. Congratulations!\"\n\nIn January 2014, the USTA Foundation, formally USTA Serves, combined with USTA NJTL, a national network of 630 community-based tennis and education programs serving more than 330,000 youth, to become a fully operational foundation. This marks the 20th anniversary of the USTA Foundation and the 45th anniversary of NJTL, which was founded by Arthur Ashe, Charlie Pasarell and Sheridan Snyder.\n\nCredit photo: Jen Pottheiser, USTA\n\nBarbara Wynn, Arthur Ashe Essay Contest Founder; Andreas Noland, boys 17-18 winner; David Dinkins, 106th Mayor of New York City; Dan Limbago, USTA Foundation Programs & Services National Manager"
