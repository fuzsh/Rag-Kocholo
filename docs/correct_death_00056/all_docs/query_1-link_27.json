        "text": "On December 3, 1992, two months before his death, Arthur Ashe announced the creation of the Arthur Ashe Institute for Urban Health (AAIUH) in response to concerns about health care delivery in urban America. He knew that the disproportionate amount of illness and death from preventable diseases in our nation’s mult­­i-ethnic communities was not only caused by inadequate health care delivery, but also by late detection - the result of limited and, too often, culturally inappropriate health education information.\n\nTwenty-Five years later, the Institute remains true to Arthur’s vision addressing health inequities through community outreach and education, facilitating behavior change and expanding access to care among the most vulnerable populations in urban areas."
