        "text": "Today in History:\n\nOn Feb. 6, 1993, tennis Hall of Famer and human rights advocate Arthur Ashe died in New York at age 49 from AIDS-related pneumonia.\n\nOn this date:\n\nIn 1778, during the American Revolutionary War, the United States won official recognition and military support from France with the signing of a Treaty of Alliance in Paris.\n\nIn 1788, Massachusetts became the sixth state to ratify the U.S. Constitution.\n\nIn 1815, the state of New Jersey issued the first American railroad charter to John Stevens, who proposed a rail link between Trenton and New Brunswick. (The line, however, was never built.)\n\nIn 1862, during the Civil War, Fort Henry in Tennessee fell to Union forces.\n\nIn 1899, a peace treaty between the United States and Spain was ratified by the U.S. Senate.\n\nIn 1911, Ronald Wilson Reagan, the 40th president of the United States, was born in Tampico, Illinois.\n\nIn 1922, Cardinal Archille Ratti was elected pope; he took the name Pius XI.\n\nIn 1933, the 20th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution, the so-called “lame duck” amendment, was proclaimed in effect by Secretary of State Henry Stimson.\n\nIn 1952, Britain’s King George VI, 56, died at Sandringham House in Norfolk, England; he was succeeded as monarch by his 25-year-old elder daughter, who became Queen Elizabeth II.\n\nIn 1998, Carl Wilson, a founding member of The Beach Boys, died in Los Angeles at age 51.\n\nIn 2000, first lady Hillary Rodham Clinton launched her successful candidacy for the U.S. Senate.\n\nIn 2008, the Bush White House defended the use of the interrogation technique known as waterboarding, saying it was legal, not torture, and had saved American lives.\n\nIn 2013, toy maker Hasbro Inc. announced that Monopoly fans had voted online to add a cat token to the board game, replacing the iron.\n\nIn 2018, casino mogul Steve Wynn resigned as chairman and CEO of Wynn Resorts amid sexual misconduct allegations.\n\nIn 2021, George P. Shultz, who was President Ronald Reagan’s secretary of state as part of a long career in public service, died at his California home; he was 100.\n\nIn 2022, Queen Elizabeth II celebrated the 70th anniversary of her ascendance to the British throne, an unprecedented reign that made her a symbol of stability in the United Kingdom."
