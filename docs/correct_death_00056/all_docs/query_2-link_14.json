        "text": "Arthur Robert Ashe, Jr., tennis champion and human rights activist, was born in Richmond, Virginia on July 10, 1943, the son of Arthur Robert Ashe, Sr. and Mattie Cunningham Ashe. He grew up adjacent to Brook Field park, a segregated playground where his father served as superintendent. His mother died in 1950 when he was six years old; his father remarried Lorene Kimbrough in 1955. Ashe first began to play tennis on the park courts at about age seven. He recalled watching Ronald Charity, the most accomplished black tennis player in Richmond, practicing at the park: \"At some point Charity stopped his practice. Walking over to me, he gently asked, 'Would you like to learn to play?' 'Yes, I would', I replied. As casually as that, my life was transformed\".\n\nBy the mid-1950s, Ashe was winning trophies as a junior player, although he was barred from most of the area public courts, which were reserved for whites. Charity arranged for him to attend a camp in Lynchburg, Virginia run by Dr. Robert Walter Johnson, a physician and mentor of black tennis prodigies, including Althea Gibson. In 1957, he became the first African American to play in the Maryland boys championships, his first integrated event. The following year, as a student at Maggie Walker High School, Ashe reached the semifinals of the junior national championships. He won the singles title at the United States Tennis Association (USTA) National Junior Indoor championships in 1960 and 1961. In 1961, Ashe also won the USTA Interscholastic singles championship and was named to the Junior Davis Cup team in 1961 and 1962.\n\nJohnson arranged for Ashe to complete his senior year of high school in St. Louis and to live and train full time with teacher and tennis official Richard Hudlin. He graduated from Sumner High School there in 1961, and was accepted and enrolled at the University of California at Los Angeles (UCLA) on a tennis scholarship. In 1963, he won the United States Hardcourt Championships and was named to the Davis Cup team. He would play on the Davis Cup team from 1963 to 1970, as well as in 1975, 1976, and 1978. Also in 1963, Ashe made his first trip outside the United States, to play at Wimbledon. In 1965, Ashe won the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) singles and doubles championships and led UCLA to the team title. He was named to the All-American team from 1963 to 1965. After taking time off from school to play in Australia, he received his bachelor's degree in business administration from UCLA, along with an ROTC commission, in 1966.\n\nAshe entered the United States Army as a second lieutenant in 1967, and served for two years as a systems analyst at Fort Benjamin Harrison in Indiana and the United States Military Academy at West Point. He continued to compete in national and international tennis tournaments and took part in the debates regarding the changing status of amateurs and professionals. In September 1968, while still an amateur, Ashe defeated Tom Okker to capture the United States Open. He was ranked number one in the world for the first time, sharing that honor with Australian Rod Laver. After the Davis Cup matches in December, he toured Asia, including Vietnam where he visited troops and held tennis exhibitions.\n\n1968 was also a year in which Ashe's political consciousness began to mature. Two years earlier, the 22-year old Ashe had told The New York Times: \"I'm no militant Negro, no crusader. I want to do something for my race, but I figure I can do it best by example, by showing Negro boys the way. That's what Jackie Robinson and Willie Mays have done\". He added that when people saw that his closest friend on tour was white Texan Cliff Richey, \"it must do a little good\". In January 1968, the Times reported that Ashe would deliver his first political speech at a church in Washington, D. C. Martin Luther King, Jr. wrote a letter of encouragement: \"Your eminence in the world of sports and athletics gives you an added measure of authority and responsibility. It is heartening indeed when you bring these attributes to the movement\". He also soon joined Jackie Robinson and others in a statement urging the United States Olympic Committee to support a continued ban on South Africa's participation in the Olympics. Although the Army reprimanded him for giving the Washington speech, he noted in his autobiography, Off the Court, that \"I gradually admitted to myself that I had a strange sense of satisfaction for speaking out....[It] marked the beginning of a period of political activity - in and out of tennis\".\n\nIn 1969, after completing his tour of active duty with the Army, Ashe turned professional. That year, he applied for a visa to play in South Africa and was rejected. At the same time, he also began a business association, which would continue for the rest of his life, with his friend and Davis Cup captain, attorney Donald Dell, and Dell's management company ProServ. With fellow players Charles Pasarell and Eugene Scott, Ashe helped create the USTA National Junior Tennis League, a program designed to develop tennis players from impoverished urban areas.\n\nIn January 1970, Ashe won the second of his three Grand Slam singles titles defeating Dick Crealy for the Australian Open championship. Soon after, he toured Africa giving tennis exhibitions, however, his visa application to South Africa was again denied. He later wrote that \"from the early 1970s, I consciously made South Africa the focus of my political energies inside and outside the United States\". To protest its apartheid policies, Ashe called for the country to be expelled from the International Lawn Tennis Federation (ILTF). \"I'll keep trying until I get in or they're kicked out of the Davis Cup or the ILTF\", he told The New York Times.\n\nAs a result of its racial policies, particularly the denial of a visa to Ashe, in March 1970, the Davis Cup nations banned South Africa from Davis Cup play for the next two years. In 1973, Ashe was finally granted a visa and, after consulting with a number of political and cultural leaders, decided to make the trip. He became the first black professional to play in the South African national championships, reaching the singles finals and winning the doubles title with Okker in a stadium where tickets in previously segregated sections were distributed to nonwhites, according to an agreement that Ashe had reached with South African tennis officials. He hoped that the policies of apartheid were beginning to loosen and that the lines of communication could be kept open.\n\nIn 1972, Ashe joined the board of directors of a new players' union, the Association of Tennis Professionals (ATP), and participated in its boycott of Wimbledon the following year to protest what the players viewed as the reactionary rules of the ILTF. He also served as ATP president in 1974-1975, as the organization prospered from the growing popularity of tennis which resulted in an increase in tournaments and prize money. He remained on the board until 1983. In 1975, Ashe upset Jimmy Connors to win at Wimbledon, and was again ranked number one. He continued to speak out against apartheid and worked with his friend, Representative (later Ambassador) Andrew Young, to raise funds to bring black South Africans to the United States to attend college. After the 1976 Soweto uprising and Olympic boycott by other African nations, he vowed not to return to South Africa until the government made significant changes in its policies.\n\nOn February 20, 1977, Ashe married Jeanne Moutoussamy, a photographer whom he had met at a benefit for the United Negro College Fund four months earlier. The ceremony was performed by Andrew Young. After missing much of the 1977 season with injuries and seeing his ranking plummet, Ashe regained his form and planned to play for at least several more years. However, while taking part in a tennis clinic in New York he suffered a heart attack in July 1979, and underwent quadruple bypass surgery that December. After suffering chest pains while jogging a few months later, he retired from competitive tennis in April 1980. Ashe was named captain of the United States Davis Cup team in September 1980 and served in that position for five years. His teams won the cup in 1981 and 1982. In June 1983, he had a second bypass operation. Following his retirement from competitive tennis in 1980, Ashe became involved in a host of projects and activities. He had already written one book, Portrait in Motion with Frank Deford in 1975, a diary of his experiences over the course of a year on the tennis tour. In 1981, he completed Off the Court with Neil Amdur and Arthur Ashe's Tennis Clinic, based on a series of articles for Tennis magazine. That year, he also became national campaign chairman to raise funds for the American Heart Association. From the late 1970s, Ashe had served as a consultant for the Aetna Life and Casualty Company, then sponsor of the World Cup tennis competition, and in 1982 he joined the board of directors. He found this work \"fascinating and satisfying\", as it involved him with issues of health, finance and diversity.\n\nIn 1983, Ashe taught a seminar at Florida Memorial College in Miami on \"The Black Athlete and Contemporary Society\", which led to his researching and writing a comprehensive history of African-American athletes, A Hard Road to Glory: A History of the African-American Athlete. That same year, continuing his anti-apartheid work, he founded Artists and Athletes Against Apartheid with Harry Belafonte to persuade other athletes and performing artists to boycott South Africa. Along with others, he was arrested during an anti-apartheid protest outside the South African embassy in January 1985. That July, he was inducted into the International Tennis Hall of Fame in Newport, Rhode Island. Ashe also served as a television commentator for HBO and ABC and continued a column in the Washington Post, begun in 1977, writing about racism in sports and society, athletes and education, apartheid, and many other subjects.\n\nAshe became a father in 1986 with the arrival of his daughter Camera. He continued his work on A Hard Road to Glory and adapted it for a television documentary, winning a 1986 Sports Emmy for writing. The three-volume study was published in 1988. He maintained his involvement in junior tennis and player development as a member of USTA committees, as well as in anti-apartheid activities, particularly as a board member of TransAfrica, a lobbying and research group on African affairs, headed by his childhood friend Randall Robinson. With tennis instructor Nick Bollettieri, he founded the Ashe-Bollettieri Cities (ABC) Tennis Program. \"Our idea was to use tennis as a way to gain and hold the attention of young people in the inner cities and other poor environments so that we could then teach them about matters more important than tennis\", he later wrote. That program was followed by the Athlete-Career Connection to increase graduation rates of minority students and the Safe Passage Foundation, which absorbed the ABC Tennis program in 1990. Ashe received numerous awards for his activities, including the Kappa Alpha Psi fraternity Laurel Wreath Award and honorary doctorates from Virginia Union, Virginia Commonwealth, Trinity (CT), St. John's, Princeton, Dartmouth, Wake Forest, the University of South Carolina, Long Island University, Ohio Wesleyan, and William and Mary, among others.\n\nIn September 1988, after Ashe had experienced symptoms of weakness and numbness, tests revealed that he was HIV-positive. Ashe and his doctors believed that transfused blood he had received in order to shore up his strength after his second bypass surgery in 1983 was the cause of the disease. He made the decision to keep the news of his illness confidential except for his family and a few close friends believing that his health was \"no one's legitimate concern except my own\". He continued his writing and lecturing, business ventures, and travels, revising A Hard Road to Glory and participating in an October 1991 tour of South Africa as part of a 31-member delegation of prominent African Americans invited by Nelson Mandela.\n\nBy April 1992, editors at USA Today had heard rumors concerning Ashe's health and intended to publish a story if the rumors could be confirmed. Anticipating the revelation, Ashe held a press conference on April 8 to announce that he had AIDS. Although at first angry at the invasion of his privacy, he soon became active in the fight against AIDS, raising funds and speaking throughout the country to increase public awareness. He established the Arthur Ashe Foundation for the Defeat of AIDS, spoke to the United Nations on World AIDS Day, and joined the National Advisory Council of the Harvard AIDS Institute. He was also arrested again for his political activities, in front of the White House protesting the Bush administration's treatment of Haitian refugees. In the months prior to his death, he continued to receive awards for his work and was named Sports Illustrated's Sportsman of the Year. With scholar Arnold Rampersad, he began work on an autobiography, Days of Grace: A Memoir, completed days before his death.\n\nAshe died of pneumonia in New York City on February 6, 1993, and was buried in Richmond, Virginia. His impact on the lives of others, as an athlete, author and activist was reflected in the many posthumous tributes he received, including honorary degrees from Yale, Columbia, New York University, Amherst, and Haverford, and the Presidential Medal of Freedom. Three years after his death, a statue of Ashe was unveiled on Richmond's Monument Avenue, in sharp contrast to the statues of Confederate war heroes which lined the avenue. He is surrounded by children, holding a tennis racquet in one hand and books in the other. A new stadium at the National Tennis Center in Flushing Meadows, New York, dedicated in 1997, was named in his honor, as was the UCLA student health center.\n\n[Unless otherwise noted, quotations are taken from Ashe's autobiography, Days of Grace: A Memoir.]"
