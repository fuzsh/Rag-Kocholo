        "text": "Arthur Ashe was a Hall of Fame tennis player, and an even better man. The beloved social justice icon earned a reputation as someone who treated everyone he encountered with kindness and as equals.\n\nFormer Solano College tennis player Connor Ard is going to be recognized for many of those same qualities.\n\nArd will join the world’s best tennis players later this month at the U.S. Open in New York City, where he will receive the national Arthur Ashe Award. The trip will include the awards banquet at the Yale Club in New York City and participation in Arthur Ashe Kids Day as well as the Tennis Mentoring Program at Cary Leeds.\n\nArd found out about the award recently at a tournament in Stockton.\n\n“I already knew I was nominated, but hadn’t heard anything about the regional award for a while,” Ard said. “I was playing with my doubles partner (Jackson DeVries) in Stockton and somebody recorgnized him and said the ITA (International Tennis Association) had done a story featuring him. We went online and saw that I had won the award. I was shocked and amazed and at first it didn’t cross my mind that this was a national award. My coach congragulated me and said he was proud I won.”\n\nHis coach, Connor Van Alstyne, knew about the good news three days before Ard did but was told to keep it a secret.\n\n“I received the news in an email and was very excited. Obviously to win it nationally and not regionally hits a little bit differently,” Van Alstyne said. “I had to contain myself not to tell him because I was overjoyed and wanted to share the news.”\n\nThe coach said that even though Ard only played one year at Solano (he’s transferrring to Fresno State this fall) he was glad to have been his coach.\n\n“He deserves this because he’s a generational type player,” Van Alstyne said. “His energy is unparrelled and and his work ethic is second to none. How he treated his teammates and coaches from Day 1 is like nothing I’ve ever seen. That first day of practice is usually awkward and a tough way to break the ice, but he always introduced himself and made everyone feel comfortable. He took a lot of pressure off people.”\n\nSo where does that attitude spring from?\n\n“I guess a lot of it comes from my friends and family and previous coaches I’ve had,” Ard said.\n\nArd, who went to high school at Fairfield, says he’s honored to receive an award named after Ashe, the first Black player selected to the United States Davis Cup team and the only Black man ever to win the singles title at Wimbledon, the U.S. Open, and the Australian Open. He retired in 1980.\n\nIn 1975 Ashe was awarded the Martini and Rossi’ Award, voted on by a panel of journalists, and the ATP Player of the Year award. In the ATP computer rankings, he peaked at No. 2 in May 1976.\n\nAshe is believed to have acquired HIV from a blood transfusion he received during heart bypass surgery in 1983. He announced his illness in April 1992 and began working to educate others about HIV and AIDS. He founded the Arthur Ashe Foundation for the Defeat of AIDS.\n\nAshe died from AIDS-related pneumonia at the age of 49 on Feb. 6, 1993. A few months later he was posthumously awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom by President Clinton.\n\n“I know a bit about him (Ashe) and I know he was the pinnacle of what good sportsmanship is,” Ard said. “He did a lot for tennis and I’m really glad I’m winning this award named after him.”\n\nDuring Ard’s one year at Solano, he went 12-7 in singles and 14-0 in doubles play, winning the Big South Conference doubles title. He made the semifinals in the conference’s singles championships.\n\nFresno State cut its men’s tennis program after the 2021 season, but Ard plans on playing in park and recreation leagues. He plans on studying biology so he can one day be a veterinarian.\n\n“As a coach I can’t speak highly enough of him,” Van Alstyne said. “I was blessed to have the one season with him and it’s just the beginning of great things to come for him.”\n\nArd is scheduled to receive the Ashe award between Aug. 26-28."
