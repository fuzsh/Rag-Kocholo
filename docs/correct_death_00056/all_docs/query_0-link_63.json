        "text": "Option 1: Take the subway.\n\nThe train stops at Mets-Willets Point. Follow the signs within the station to Flushing Meadows Corona Park and the National Tennis Center.\n\nFare: $2.90 for most riders.\n\nThere is an accessible exit from the Flushing-bound platform that is open for major events only. Exit on the right-hand side of the train and take the ramp.\n\nFor Manhattan-bound service, use the ramp and take a Flushing-bound train to Flushing-Main St and remain on the train as it will return to Manhattan.\n\nOption 2: Take the Long Island Rail Road or Metro-North Railroad.\n\nThe Mets-Willets Point Station is on LIRR's Port Washington Branch and slightly closer to the National Tennis Center than the subway station. Direct train service to events is available from Penn Station, Grand Central, Woodside, and all stations on the Port Washington Branch. Or, transfer at Woodside from other branches.\n\nOn Metro-North, connect to the LIRR or the at Grand Central. Use the MTA TrainTime app to buy your ticket from a Metro-North station to Mets-Willets Point. For an accessible trip, use the subway from Grand Central. The Mets-Willets Point LIRR station is not accessible.\n\nTake your ticket with you when you exit the train. It will be checked at the station before you can exit.\n\nAfter the event, trains may be held at Mets-Willets Point to ensure all customers have an opportunity to board. As a result we may not always be able to hold connecting trains at Woodside or Penn Station.\n\nFare: Plan a trip to see your exact fare. Fans traveling from branches other than the Port Washington Branch who change at Woodside will not need a separate ticket for that part of the journey. Since Mets-Willets Point is located in Fare Zone 1, tickets to Woodside or Penn Station are valid to Mets-Willets Point as well.\n\nMets-Willets Point is not an accessible station. For an accessible trip, transfer at Woodside for the subway."
