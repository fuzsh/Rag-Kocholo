        "text": "It is difficult to believe, but many of the fans walking into Arthur Ashe Stadium at the U.S. Open this summer will not have the slightest notion of who Arthur Ashe was. And so, on the 25th anniversary Tuesday of Ashe’s all-too-early death at the age of 49, I feel compelled to provide a mere sketch of this special human being.\n\nI am grateful to have been Ashe’s friend, lawyer and business adviser for 23 years. He was the definition of grace, dignity, elegance and style. As one of the world’s greatest tennis players, he was the consummate professional: fiercely competitive yet respectful, disciplined yet creative, a genuine student of the game. The late tennis chronicler Bud Collins called him the “thinking man’s tennis player.”\n\nHe had the championships to validate his immense athletic talents and strategic skills. He won the first U.S. men’s singles championship of the Open era in 1968 at Forest Hills while still an amateur. He captured the Wimbledon singles title in 1975 and recorded many triumphs representing the United States in Davis Cup play, including winning the Cup for the U.S. in 1968 and 1969 as part of a team I captained.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAshe’s impact off the court was profound. Far too many of today’s elite athletes seem to run away from the pressures of being a role model, but he embraced it. He was a true humanitarian, launching or working on behalf of a range of causes. He was committed to creating tennis and sports opportunities for underserved youth. The movement against apartheid in South Africa became a longtime passion for which he protested often, more than once being led away in handcuffs. Ashe took up the cause of public health when the heart disease that ran in his family struck him, and again when he contracted HIV during a second open heart surgery, making it his mission — his last — to alleviate the fear of the disease and those with AIDS.\n\nHis various causes reflected his insatiable curiosity. Art, music, history, politics, international affairs — he was a keen observer of all of these. He read voraciously, wrote six books and had a celebrated public feud with Georgetown University basketball coach John Thompson over the NCAA raising academic standards for college athletes. Ashe believed raising academic standards, not lowering them, was the right course, epitomizing his confidence in what young athletes could do if properly challenged.\n\nEducation, and learning for its own sake, were central to Ashe. He was deeply interested in the history of the black athlete in America. When he found no such definitive history, he decided to write one. The result was the three-volume “A Hard Road to Glory,” which was eventually produced as an Emmy-winning documentary.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI often joked with Ashe that he was a true citizen of the world, and indeed he was. Recognized internationally as much as any athlete of his time save perhaps for Muhammad Ali, he always felt at home in Washington. He conducted countless clinics, visited schools and community centers, and took advantage of his time in D.C. to share his thoughts with policymakers.\n\nOne occasion is emblematic of Ashe’s global stature. Following his release from prison in South Africa, Nelson Mandela came to New York to address the United Nations and launch a multi-city American tour. After landing in New York, his staff told Mandela that he could see and talk with anyone he wanted. What international leader or intellectual did he wish to see? Almost without hesitation, Mandela said, “How about that man, Arthur Ashe?”\n\nWhile imprisoned, Mandela had followed Ashe’s groundbreaking trip to South Africa in 1973, cognizant of the impact this visit would have on his black countrymen. The following year, Ashe returned to South Africa and visited Mandela in his prison cell on Robben Island. When the meeting in New York came about, what I witnessed was two men of unswerving principle, each appreciative of the other’s conviction and courage.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPerhaps it is that first tour of South Africa that is most emblematic of Ashe’s legacy. What I remember most vividly is the faces of the children who came to see him play in the national championships or conduct tennis clinics. Ashe’s presence, the deference afforded him by whites, his command of the proceedings, was likely a tableau they had never witnessed. Even the simple act of Arthur being handed a towel by a white ballboy — rather than the other way around — inspired looks of disbelief on their young, hopeful faces. Among those young people was Mark Mathabane, who wrote movingly of his astonishment at the scene in his best-selling memoir, “Kaffir Boy: The True Story of a Black Youth’s Coming of Age in Apartheid South Africa.”\n\nSimilarly, I look back in wonderment at the life and legacy of Arthur Ashe, a man of great vision and character who left this world too soon. A quarter-century on, for me and no doubt countless others, both the admiration and the sorrow endure. Arthur: America, and the world, misses you.\n\nDonald L.
