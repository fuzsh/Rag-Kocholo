        "text": "An evening of friendly cosplay competition led to surprises and a history lesson for housemates in the second episode of Season 2 of Summer House: Martha’s Vineyard.\n\nHow to Watch\n\nWatch Summer House: Martha’s Vineyard onPeacock and the Bravo app.\n\nThe object of the fun and games was to choose a decade and then dress the part of a character from that era, as seen in a new preview clip for the episode, airing Sunday at 9/8c.\n\nBrand consultant Nicholas “Nick” Arrington served up 1970s tennis great Arthur Ashe, a renowned sports figure and social activist who’s clearly had made an impression on him. Nick believed he aced his cosplay efforts, but his housemates, just didn’t get it.\n\nAfter giving him a reception that amounted to crickets, Nick got unceremoniously booed off the stage, as you can see in the clip, above.\n\nWho is Arthur Ashe?\n\nArthur Ashe was a trailblazing American tennis player. He was revered not only for his sporting prowess but also his activism and efforts for equality. Ashe was the first Black man to win the US Open (1968), Australian Open (1970), and Wimbledon (1975), per tennisfame.com. His wins elevated him to iconic status in tennis history.\n\nOff the court, Ashe was a vocal advocate for civil rights and AIDS awareness. Ashe believed he contracted HIV through a blood transfusion, and ultimately died at age 49 in 1993.\n\nHis namesake Arthur Ashe Stadium is in Queens, New York.\n\nWhat Happens in Episode 2 of Summer House: Martha's Vineyard\n\nNick knows Ashe’s history — and his look. To dress the part he wore glasses and raided his closet for a traditional tennis vibe: blue shorts, a white crew neck shirt, and a white warm-up jacket.\n\nHere's what you missed on Bravo:\n\nWhy Silas Cooper Isn’t Returning to Summer House: Martha's Vineyard\n\nMeet the Cast of Summer House: Martha's Vineyard\n\n\"Nothing's Off the Table\" in the Summer House: Martha's Vineyard Season 2 Sneak Peek\n\n“You gotta explain the attire, 'cause I don’t know,” said Noelle Hughley, a newcomer to the house in Season 2.\n\nPhoto: Kareem Black/Bravo\n\n“If you guys don’t know who Arthur Ashe is … ” replied Nick, who was practically speechless.\n\nHousemates stared blankly, checked their text messages, and sipped their drinks.\n\nWhen asked directly by a producer, Noelle looked stumped. Bria Fleming sought a digital assist from Siri. Amir Lancaster admitted he had “no idea who Arthur Ashe is.” Nick, meanwhile, said that “Arthur Ashe was arguably one of the best tennis players of all time.”\n\nBria eventually got a version of that same answer from Siri, and when she looked at a picture of Ashe, she observed: “He looks like Nick.”\n\nGuess the costume was a success!\n\nHowever, during his time in the cosplay spotlight, Nick said, “I’m just here to win championships.”\n\nLed by Shanice Henderson, heckling rose up in the room: “Boo. Get off the stage. Boo. Get off the stage.”\n\nA housemate said, “The people have spoken.” It was game over for Nick.\n\nThe Season 2 house also includes Jasmine Ellis Cooper,Jordan Emanuel, Preston Mitchum, Summer Marie Thomas, and Alex Tyree. What other fun and games do they all get into?"
