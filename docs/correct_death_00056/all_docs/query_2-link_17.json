        "text": "Control is very important to me,” ARTHUR ASHE used to say.\n\nAs a boy, he was very aware of having no control over so many things — where he would go to school, where in the city he could go, where on the bus he could stand, and what he could and couldn’t say. He was born in 1943, raised in Richmond, Virginia as a “Negro” when it was still a very segregated city — and in his first flush of fame was a hero only to the “Negro” side of the city. But by the end of his too-short life, he’d become a hero to the whole city and, indeed, to the world.\n\nFrom the age of five or six, Arthur was determined to understand why things were as they were. Racism was impossible to rationally understand or approve, but he made a mental adjustment. ‘White people can wake up and go about the day’s business. We black people have bits of our day snatched from us simply because some aspect of what we say or do or simply ARE challenges a white person in some way. I have to keep this to a minimum.’\n\nHe was always comfortable with himself, patient, willing to explain himself if someone didn’t understand, tolerant, enjoying things quietly. Once at a club tournament two white club ladies with beehive hairdos and frozen smiles walked over to Ashe.\n\n“Oh, God,” said Arthur Ashe. “Here they come to put me at ease.”\n\nArthur’s parents met at the Westwood Baptist Church, and brought him there to church every Sunday. He played sports at old Brook Field.\n\nAs a small boy, Arthur was very close to his mother, Mattie. They read books together and she helped him fall in love with reading. But Mattie died when Arthur was six.\n\nHe was “skinny as a straw” but a natural athlete who took to tennis right away. Never, though, at the cost of a general interest in life. He was deeply interested in history — getting it right, understanding it and preserving it.\n\nAll through his life, he kept this passion for history. As a famous tennis player, he went around talking at largely white colleges and urged his audience to choose a black college, adopt it, and give it money every year. And the reason was not just that Tennessee State needed the money more than Yale but because Tennessee State was a repository of black culture, and he didn’t want that culture to be lost.\n\nHe was a sharp young man, observant, and had the luck, or good sense, to develop a great sense of humor. He was low-key and polite, and his convictions were entirely his own, and were mostly but not entirely liberal. His laugh was high-pitched, almost a screech, and it came out of such a serious, measured personality that it surprised you.\n\nAshe left Richmond at 18, tired of its insularity and its bigotries. He went all the way west to Los Angeles, California and UCLA. All his life, he talked about how terribly important it is to get young people to go to college, to improve and socialize their bright young minds, to expand the world view of poor and marginalized kids. Ashe was sure that a failure to educate these young people was a tragedy not just for them but for the nation.\n\nAshe led the UCLA tennis team to a team title while winning a single titles himself. In 1965, he graduated from UCLA, in 1966 he got a B.A. in Business Administration, and then he became an African-American trailblazer on the pro tennis circuit.\n\nHe was pleased, to an extent, by the rise to prominence of black public intellectuals — but not when they told him what to think or say. Then he was right back in Richmond, Virginia in 1950, and he balked. The black activist Harry Edwards tried to convince Ashe to boycott the 1968 Olympics. No dice. Edwards made clear that to take part in the Olympics would make people “in the community” regard Ashe as an “Uncle Tom.” Ashe took this in, in his measured way, and said it made little difference to him.\n\nIn 1968, he won the U.S. Open — the first African-American to do so. He was proud of being black, proud of his African ancestry. But he was also eager to escape simplistic labels. He didn’t want to be confined to being simply “a tennis player” and certainly didn’t want to be confined to being “a black tennis player.”\n\nIn 1975, Arthur Ashe won Wimbledon, beating the great Jimmy Connors. The key to this upset was that Ashe saw that Connors fed off the powerful ground strokes of his opponents. Connors had mastered the art of using the power of the other player against him. Ashe beat Connors with a bunch of dink and change of pace shots. There was no power to return, and Connors was thrown off his game. As Connors grew frustrated, Ashe took control of the match.\n\nHe could have contented himself with fame and wealth on the pro circuit, but he felt it was important for athletes, and for all those privileged by fame and money, to speak out and, where necessary, to lead. He always liked to be around good people, but recognized that he was, at heart, a loner.\n\nIn 1983, Ashe needed heart surgery, and when some transfused blood he got was infected with AIDS, Ashe came down with AIDS.\n\nHe refused to feel sorry for himself. He figured if he said, ‘God, why me?’ then he’d also have to say, ‘God, why me?’ for all of his success in tennis, for all of his happiness. He preferred not to question why his life had happened, but simply to live it.\n\nWhen white people said they were sorry he had AIDS, Ashe might say quietly that being an AIDS patient in the United States wasn’t as hard as being black. In 1993, after a brave and dignified battle, Arthur Ashe died of AIDS, and in 1995, Richmond’s Planning Commission voted not only to have an Arthur Ashe statue in the city, but to put it on Monument Avenue, the city’s great avenue.\n\nSince Ashe didn’t want to be remembered for his tennis as much as for the hard work he’d done to try to improve the world, I’ll try to describe one piece of that work, a trip Ashe took to South Africa in 1973, at the height of apartheid.\n\nSouth Africa was a brutally racist nation then. Many liberals were saying “Apartheid must go!’ — but very few of them thought it would go anywhere in their lifetime. The South African government didn’t even allow television to be broadcast in the country for fear that people would see, and want to imitate, unwholesome things like race-mixing.\n\nWhen Ashe was in a London hotel, a few hours away from boarding the plane to South Africa, a delegation of South African exiles asked to meet with him. He said sure. ‘Don’t go!’ they said. One of them was urgent, almost pleading: “They’re using you, Arthur!”\n\nAshe paused, then replied, “I know that. But I’m using them, too.”\n\nHe stayed in a wealthy neighborhood of Johannesburg, saw the tourist spots but also visited a black township in Soweto, giving extra time to the children, one of whom said “Master, I never even SAW a free black man before.”\n\nHe met a white transplant surgeon, a hero in South Africa’s medical world, who told Ashe that blacks were like children and would always need looking after. Black crowds called Ashe “Sipho!” He learned that it meant “gift,” in Swahili.\n\nAshe kept his wry humor. He met with some children with dark black skin, and shook his head and told a sportswriter who was with him, “I’m too light here. No matter where I am, I’m never the right color.”\n\nThe last place Ashe went in South Africa was Stellenbosch, the Afrikaner Harvard, the “best” school for the elite white kids.\n\nIt was a sort of ambush they’d laid for Ashe, because they’d asked him to debate racial integration against a star of the Stellenbosch faculty, an Anthropology professor named Christof Hanekom, and three of his best debate students.\n\nAshe and a few companions were led into a beautiful courtyard. There were mighty oak trees above, and jacaranda blooming. At tables with pressed white tablecloths, 50 guests had been invited to witness the debate. Tea and finger sandwiches were served, and the politeness, the civility was in garish contrast to the principle being advanced — that this international tennis star and public intellectual was not the equal of the professor and his young acolytes simply because he had dark skin.\n\nOne of the students praised apartheid, and told Ashe complacently, “This way we don’t have the riots that you suffer in your country.”\n\nAshe replied, “Perhaps riots are a small price to pay for freedom of expression.” A capable volley, but now Ashe came to the net. He turned on Professor Hanekom: “Tell me, professor, are you scared?”\n\nHanekom had to gather himself before he could reply, and his “No” didn’t sound very convincing, even to his own partisans.\n\n“Boy, I’d be, if I were you,” said Ashe, with a ghostly chuckle. He spoke of the racial murders committed by whites, the rapes, the innocent blacks taken prisoner.\n\nThe South African debaters tried to rally, pointing out that President Kennedy had been assassinated in the U.S., arguing that Ashe was himself “culturally white.”\n\nThen Ashe said, “All the intellectual and political position papers forgotten, in your heart, in YOUR HEART, do you think it’s right?”\n\nThe students dropped their eyes. Professor Hanekom, perhaps alarmed by what his heart was telling him, retreated to the cover of jargon and apartheid slogans.\n\nAshe pressed his point: “Forget all that, professor. Just what about THIS MAN?”\n\nAshe had found the one other black man in the courtyard, a dignified gentleman, dressed in a coat and tie. Ashe pointed to him and said, “Why can you vote and THIS man can’t? Why are you free and this man isn’t?”\n\nProfessor Hanekom was silent for a minute, then said, “Mr. Ashe, that is an ace up your sleeve. I cannot defend that.” He appeared stunned, as did the audience, Professor Hanekom’s pet students, and the journalists in the courtyard.\n\nThe only one who seemed unsurprised by how the debate had ended was Arthur Ashe."
