        "text": "A big moment for tennis and New York City was Aug. 25, 1997, when the Arthur Ashe Stadium opened at the Billie Jean National Tennis Center.\n\nWith over 23,000 seats, it was then and still is the largest tennis stadium in the world.\n\nâWhat they were thinking was 23,000 people wanted to come out day and night for 14 days to watch the US Open,â Danny Zausner, COO of USTA Billie Jean King National Tennis Center, said. âSo it was a brilliant move and 25 years later we have record-breaking grounds every year.â\n\nWhat You Need To Know\n\nArthur Ashe Stadium opened Aug. 25, 1997 at the Billie Jean King National Tennis Center\n\nWith over 23,000 seats, Arthur Ashe Stadium is the largest tennis stadium in the world\n\nThe stadium is named in honor of one of the sport's greatest champions. Arthur Ashe was the first and, so far, only Black man to win the US Open, the Australian Open and Wimbledon\n\nArthur Ashe Stadium helped make tennis more accessible at the US Open.\n\nâTook it more from an exclusive intimate environment to a larger public environment to more cultures and creeds of New York and our country,â Christopher Clarey, a tennis correspondent for The New York Times, said.\n\nThe stadium is named in honor of one of the sportâs greatest champions. Arthur Ashe was the first and, so far, only Black man to win the US Open, Wimbledon and the Australian Open.\n\nHe was beloved not just for what he did for tennis but also the world. He addressed a wide range of social issues.\n\nâNaming it for Arthur Ashe was a stroke of genius. I think it was a great call. It was an appropriate gesture. With Arthurâs history in the game. Being a pioneer as he was,â Clarey said.\n\nThe arena is a lot like the city it calls home.\n\nFans who have experienced âAsheâ call it loud â full of energy, even gritty.\n\nâIt think itâs electric because I think you could have a really good vantage point from seat in the stadium. And the fans are always so supportive of the Americans and everyone whoâs come to play. Itâs just a fun atmosphere to be a part of of,â tennis fan Natalie Hirschfeld said.\n\nOver the years, Arthur Ashe Stadium hosted some of the biggest moments in tennis.\n\nThe year it opened, a 17-year -old Venus Williams made her first Grand Slam final.\n\nTwo years later, also at 17, little sister, Serena Williams, won her first of 23 Grand Slams.\n\nIn 2016, as part of a $500 million renovation to the tennis center, the USTA put a retractable roof over the stadium.\n\nAnother crowning achievement for an iconic arena that, after 25 years, still reigns supreme."
