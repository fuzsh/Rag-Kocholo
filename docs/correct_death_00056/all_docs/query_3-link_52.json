        "text": "“Richmond is known as a city of monuments. And the marquee street for monuments is Monument Avenue,” declared Richmond sportswriter Paul Woody in a 1995 column. “But the unfortunate impression left on some by the statues is that the street is reserved for Confederate leaders and Matthew Fontaine Maury. This impression should be changed. What better way to bring about change than by having a statue of [Arthur] Ashe on the city’s grandest boulevard?”\n\nNo one disputed that Arthur Ashe, the African-American tennis champion, humanitarian, and Richmond native son who had died recently from AIDS contracted during a blood transfusion, deserved a statue. Whether a street known internationally for its statues of Confederate heroes was the right place for Ashe or the only place for Ashe was the subject of a debate that focused international attention on Richmond.\n\nAs Richmonders in 2017 debate the future of Monument Avenue’s Confederate statues, it is useful to recall how 21 years ago – and 19 years after African Americans achieved majority control of the city government – Richmond integrated its most famous street.\n\nUnlike the organizational efforts responsible for the five previous Monument Avenue statues, the Ashe statue originated almost by accident. After meeting Ashe in 1992 and learning of Ashe’s dream of building an African-American Sports Hall of Fame in Richmond, sculptor Paul DiPasquale proposed a statue of Ashe to be located at the Hall of Fame. Ashe approved DiPasquale’s idea and stipulated a short list of features he wanted the statue to incorporate. Shortly before sculptor and subject were to meet, Ashe died on February 6, 1993.\n\nThe Sports Hall of Fame proposal went moribund after the death of its inspiration, but the statue lived on. It came to public attention in late 1994 when Virginia Heroes, a mentoring organization founded in 1990, announced a $400,000 fundraising campaign. Richmond City Council pledged $100,000 toward the project.\n\nFormer Virginia Governor L. Douglas Wilder (the nation’s first elected African-American governor) suggested that the statue should be erected on Monument Avenue. For the next 18 months, Richmonders and interested outsiders engaged in a wide-ranging discussion of the past, present, and future meaning of Monument Avenue.\n\nAs Paul Woody had written, placing the Ashe statue on Monument Avenue made a powerful statement about a new, more inclusive, Richmond. That symbolic gesture met with expected and unexpected opposition during a debate that confounded the customary racial battle lines.\n\nPredictably, Confederate heritage groups and individuals who considered Monument Avenue “hallowed ground,” protested the inappropriateness of adding Ashe’s statue. The reason, ostensibly, was not the color of Ashe’s skin, but the nature of his accomplishments. A letter to a Richmond weekly paper complained that putting Ashe on Monument Avenue would be “a palpable breach of commemorative protocol. It violates categorical distinction of motif. Ashe was not a military hero, and General Lee and his Confederates were not playing competitive or diversionary sports.”\n\n“In reality,” the letter went on, addressing the proverbial elephant in the room, “the Ashe statue is the symbol of a racially factional commemorative turf invasion, conveniently using a sports arriviste for a pretext.”\n\nThe undeniable intention to integrate Monument Avenue also drew dissent from Richmond’s (African-American) mayor and the outspoken editor/publisher of the African-American weekly Richmond Free Press. “Arthur Ashe, a true hero whose shining performance on and off the tennis court gave him world fame, deserves far more than Monument Avenue,” wrote Raymond Boone in June 1995. “Monument Avenue, in all its natural and architectural beauty, celebrates the worst in our history – traitors who fought against human freedom and a mentality still with us today, that screams ‘never’ to justice for black people.”\n\nBoone and Mayor Leonidas Young lobbied to build the statue downtown. Others embraced the ironic symbolism of locating it near the public tennis courts that segregation laws had prevented young Ashe from using.\n\nAs politicians, pundits, and the public weighed in, the city’s architectural and planning boards approved the Monument Avenue location. On the eve of a planned groundbreaking, City Council put on the brakes, acknowledging that there had been no opportunity for public input. Council set a date for a public hearing; public officials and media from around the world prepared for another bitterly divisive showdown over race and the Confederate legacy for which Richmond had become famous.\n\nInstead, the hearing turned out to be what Mayor Young pronounced the city’s “finest hour” and resulted in early morning unanimous Council vote to erect the statue on Monument Avenue. The hearing impressed journalist Tony Horwitz, who expected to witness an “angry meeting.”“What I witnessed instead,” he wrote later in Confederates in the Attic, “was a thoughtful discourse on public art, the potency of historic symbols, racial healing, and affirmative action – albeit for a deceased black male who had fled Richmond at eighteen to escape what he later called ‘its segregation, its conservatism, its parochial thinking.’”\n\nWithin a few days of that cathartic Council vote, voices in Richmond’s art community suggested that the design of the Ashe statue needed public input and the kind of formal design competition that had characterized the earlier Monument Avenue statues. Paul DiPasquale’s design based on his subject’s own requirements featured a casually-dressed Ashe holding a tennis racket in his wrong (left) hand and books in the other looking down on the torsos, heads, and uplifted arms of racially diverse children. Standing on a trophy-like 16-foot base, the relatively diminutive statue (12 feet to the top of the books) struck many of its supporters as “a third-rate monument masquerading as an honor to a first-rate man.”\n\nAs the arts community lobbied for a new design, Ashe’s widow, Jeanne Moutoussamy-Ashe, threw the whole project into doubt with an op-ed column published on New Year’s Day, 1996. “No, I am not in agreement with the decision to place the ‘Arthur Ashe monument’ on Monument Avenue,” she explained. “My reasons are not politically driven; nor are they artistically or racially motivated. I have always felt that in all the controversy, the spirit that Arthur gave to Richmond has been overlooked. I am afraid that a statue of Arthur Ashe on Monument Avenue honors Richmond, Virginia, more than it does its son, his legacy, and his life’s work.” She urged, instead, that the city return to her husband’s original idea: an African-American Sports Hall of Fame."
