        "text": "Drawn to Michigan 〽️ “I just applied to Michigan because I'm from the Midwest, but Michigan was at the back of my mind, and I just didn't even think I would get an interview. I interviewed the last week of January, and I almost didn't interview because I was like ‘The last week of January? Clearly, they don't want me.’ I was satisfied with the other schools that I got into, so I just decided I’ll go to the Michigan interview for the experience… And, I'm like everybody likes it. People are really happy here. They loved it. Nobody had a bad thing to say. I asked the faculty and the students to name just one thing that you don't like about Michigan, but everything they said to me wasn’t even really a con. I just felt like people were genuinely happy here. And, when I talked to the black students, they all had their reasons for coming here, and they all seemed valid to me, so I was like ‘Hmm, interesting.’ And I left. That was my last interview.” A month later, Chidera Osuji was accepted to Michigan. Chidera, now entering her second year of medical school, grew up in the suburbs of Minneapolis. A natural communicator, she thought she had found her calling in journalism as a way to inform and connect with people. But, as she experienced the world, her passions began to shift. She earned a bachelor’s degree in human physiology from Boston University and decided to earn her certified nursing assistant license. “My grandpa was a judge, and I was his first grandchild, so it was always destined on me that I would become a lawyer. Even though my path went in a different direction, I’m very grateful that my family always supported me and my ambition. Both of my parents are hardworking professionals, and they never said that I couldn’t do something because of my gender or my race.” Although Chidera admits that medical school has been a humbling experience for her, it’s also been an opportunity to explore global health, as a citizen of both Nigeria and the United States, and medical innovation. “People are being left out and growing up in a predominantly white space, I never wanted anybody to be left out, and I feel like that's still happening. I don't want people to be left out. I want us all to be moving forward.”"
