        "text": "American actor\n\nIan Andrew Ziering ( ; born March 30, 1964) is an American actor best known for his role as Steve Sanders on the television series Beverly Hills, 90210, which he played from 1990 to 2000. He is also the voice of Vinnie on Biker Mice from Mars. From 2013 to 2018, he starred as Fin Shepard in the Sharknado film series. In 2019, he played the DC Comics character Blue Devil on the series Swamp Thing.\n\nEarly life\n\n[edit]\n\nZiering was born in Newark, New Jersey, the youngest of three boys for Muriel (1925–1998) and Paul M. Ziering (1921–2008), an educator, orchestra leader, and saxophonist.[1][2][3] He grew up in West Orange, New Jersey and has two older brothers, Jeff and Barry. Ziering is Jewish (his family is from Russia and Austria).[4][5] He graduated from West Orange High School in 1982, and from William Paterson University in 1988.[6]\n\nCareer\n\n[edit]\n\nIn 1990, Ziering began his portrayal of the character Steve Sanders on the hit series Beverly Hills, 90210. Sanders was a high school student and friend of Brandon Walsh (Jason Priestley), one of the series' other central characters. He is one of only four series regulars to appear on the show for its entire duration of ten seasons until 2000.\n\nIn 1998, Ziering was cast as the voice of Dr. Niko \"Nick\" Tatopoulos in Godzilla: The Series, which was a direct follow-up to the 1998 film. Ziering replaced Matthew Broderick, who portrayed Nick Tatopolous in the film.[7]\n\nIn 2006, Ziering produced, directed and starred in the short film Man vs. Monday, which won the Audience Choice Award at the 2006 Fort Lauderdale International Film Festival.[citation needed] Also in 2006, he won the Best Actor Award at the 2006 Monaco Film Festival for his portrayal of Francis in the independent film Stripped Down.[citation needed]\n\nZiering has also appeared in the television series JAG, What I Like About You, The Doctors as Erich Aldrich and Guiding Light as Cameron Stewart. He also had a role in the videogame Freelancer as the protagonist, Edison Trent.\n\nHe was a celebrity dancer in 2007 on Season 4 of Dancing with the Stars.[8] His professional dance partner was Cheryl Burke, who won the competition in Season 2 with partner Drew Lachey and Season 3 with partner Emmitt Smith. Ziering made it to the semi-finals, and received a perfect score (three 10s) from the judges for one of his two dances in the round. However, it was not enough to reach the finals: he and Burke were eliminated during the results show the next day on May 15, 2007. In 2016 Burke said the experience of working with Ziering made her want to \"slit her wrists\".[9] She later apologized, not to Ziering, but for making a thoughtless reference to suicide. Ziering did not comment publicly on Burke's comments beyond re-tweeting a message from a former co-worker that praised him as a great person to be around.\n\nOn June 18, 2007, Variety reported that Ziering had auditioned the previous week for the opportunity to succeed Bob Barker as host of The Price Is Right.[10] The job ultimately went to Drew Carey.[11] Ziering's ex-wife, Nikki, was a model on the show from 1999 to 2002.\n\nIn May, 2013, it was announced that Ziering would be performing with Chippendales as a celebrity guest star for four weeks at the Rio All Suite Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas.[12]\n\nIn 2015, he appeared on Celebrity Apprentice on NBC.\n\nIn 2018, he competed on Worst Cooks in America: Celebrity Edition.[13]\n\nIn 2019, he was cast to play the superhero, Blue Devil, on the show Swamp Thing, in the DC Universe streaming service. The show ran for only one season, though it was positively received by critics and audiences.\n\nPersonal life\n\n[edit]\n\nZiering married Playboy model Nikki Schieler in July 1997. She converted to Judaism before marrying him.[14] They filed for divorce in February 2002, citing irreconcilable differences.[15] Nikki has said that the separation was contentious and she was not given any support or help moving out; a spokesperson for Ziering stated Nikki was \"compensated above and beyond the prenup\".[16]\n\nOn February 3, 2010, Ziering announced his engagement to Erin Ludwig.[17] The couple married at a ceremony in Newport Beach, California, on May 28, 2010. They have two daughters, Mia Loren (b. April 25, 2011)[18] and Penna Mae (b. April 25, 2013).[19] On October 31, 2019, Ziering announced that the couple had separated. The divorce was finalized October 4, 2022.[20][21]\n\nZiering was involved in an altercation with a group of mini-bike riders in Los Angeles December 31, 2023. Ziering reported on social media that both he and his daughter, Penna, who was in the car when the group attacked her father, were uninjured.[22]\n\nFilmography\n\n[edit]\n\nFilm\n\n[edit]\n\nYear Title Role Notes 1981 Endless Love Sammy Butterfield Film debut 1995 Savate Cain Parker Direct-to-video 1995 No Way Back Victor Serlano 1996 Mighty Ducks the Movie: The First Face-Off Wildwing Flashblade Voice, direct-to-video 2005 Domino Himself 2005 Six Months Later Michael Short film 2006 Stripped Down Francis 2006 Man vs. Monday Dan Smith Short film; also director 2007 Tyrannosaurs Azteca Cortes 2009 Step Seven Richard Miller/Brother Abraham Short film 2010 Hopelessly Devoted unknown role Short film 2011 The Legend of Awesomest Maximus Testiclees 2012 That's My Boy TV Version Donny 2012 McKenna Shoots for the Stars Mr. Brooks 2013 Disney's Vehicle Movies unknown role Voice, short film 2013 Snake & Mongoose Keith Black 2014 Christmas in Palm Springs Teddy 2016 Killer Deal Nick Steel Short film; also producer 2017 F the Prom Ken Reede 2019 Malibu Rescue Gavin Cross Netflix film 2021 Hunters\n\nTelevision\n\n[edit]\n\nYear Title Role Notes 1981–1982 The Doctors Erich Aldrich 2 episodes 1987 Guiding Light Cameron Stewart Contract role 1988 ABC Afterschool Specials Randy Forrester Episode: \"Terrible Things My Mother Told Me\" 1990 CBS Schoolbreak Special Donnie Episode: \"Flour Babies\" 1990 Married...with Children The Kid Episode: \"The Unnatural\" 1990–2000 Beverly Hills, 90210 Steve Sanders, Ronnie Robertson Series Regular; 292 episodes\n\nProducer of 8 episodes\n\nDirector of Episode: \"I'm Using You 'Cause I Like You\"\n\nWriter of Episode: \"Sentenced to Life\" (story by) 1992 Melrose Place Steve Sanders 3 episodes 1992 The Legend of Prince Valiant Unknown Voice, 2 episodes 1992 Parker Lewis Can't Lose Himself Episode: \"Geek Tragedy\" 1993–1996 Biker Mice from Mars Vinnie Voice, main role 1994 Aaahh!!!
