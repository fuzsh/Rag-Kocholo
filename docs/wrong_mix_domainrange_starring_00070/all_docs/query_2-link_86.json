        "text": "Contact: Colleen Roche/Brenda PÃ©rez (212) 788-2958\n\nMAYOR GIULIANI PROCLAIMS MONDAY, MAY 18TH AS GODZILLA DAY IN NEW YORK CITY\n\nMayor Rudolph W. Giuliani today proclaimed Monday, May 18th as Godzilla Day in New York City, kicking off tonight's premiere of the movie Godzilla, a TriStar Pictures release and Centropolis Entertainment production. Joining the Mayor at the press conference at the Waldorf Astoria were Mayor's Office of Film, Theatre and Broadcasting Commissioner Patricia Reed Scott, Film Director Roland Emmerich, Film Producer Dean Devlin, and stars Matthew Broderick, Jean Reno and Maria Pitillo.\n\nThe Godzilla production was filmed on location throughout New York City during the month of May 1997, employing hundreds of New Yorkers. Many of New York's best known landmarks are prominently featured in the film, including the Brooklyn Bridge, the Chrysler Building, the Flatiron Building, Central Park, Wall Street and Madison Square Garden.\n\n\"Dean Devlin and Roland Emmerich chose New York City as their location for Godzilla because our world-famous cityscape is immediately recognized all over the planet,\" Mayor Giuliani said. \"Movie lovers will be treated to a Godzilla that piques the interest of old-time monster film fans and at the same time, thrills today's action film buffs. New York will hold its breath to find out whether the City can withstand the wrath of the King of the Monsters.\n\n\"We are delighted that thanks to productions like Godzilla we will continue reaping the benefits of a surging film industry that contributes billions of dollars to our economy and employs thousands of New Yorkers.\"\n\nCommissioner Scott said, \"Godzilla's visit in New York City last May was a near-perfect partnership between City residents and agencies, and one of the best film productions that we have ever assisted. With resourceful collaborators like Roland and Dean, anything is possible in the greatest City in the world.\"\n\nDirector Roland Emmerich said, \"We're very excited to be back in New York for Godzilla Day and tonight's premiere at Madison Square Garden. It was a great experience to bring Godzilla back to life here in New York and we are glad to have this opportunity. We thank the citizens of this great City for helping us make the movie.\"\n\nGodzilla will open nationwide on Wednesday, May 20th in over 7,000 movie theaters, making it the largest movie opening of all time.\n\nwww.ci.nyc.ny.us\n\nGo to Press Releases | Giuliani Archives | Mayor's Office | NYC.gov Home Page\n\nContact Us | FAQs | Privacy Statement | Site Map"
