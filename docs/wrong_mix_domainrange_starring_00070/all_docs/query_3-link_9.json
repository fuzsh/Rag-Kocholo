        "text": "ICML 2021 Workshop: Tackling Climate Change with Machine Learning\n\nAbout\n\nMany in the ML community wish to take action on climate change, but are unsure of the pathways through which they can have the most impact. This workshop highlights work that demonstrates that, while no silver bullet, ML can be an invaluable tool in reducing greenhouse gas emissions and in helping society adapt to the effects of climate change. Climate change is a complex problem, for which action takes many forms - from theoretical advances to deployment of new technology. Many of these actions represent high-impact opportunities for real-world change, and are simultaneously interesting academic research problems.\n\nThis workshop was held as part of the International Conference on Machine Learning (ICML), one of the premier conferences on machine learning, which draws a wide audience of researchers and practitioners in academia, industry, and related fields.\n\nSchedule Full Recording\n\nThe main workshop took place digitally on July 23rd, 2020, featuring 89 posters, 13 spotlight presentations, along with invited speakers and panels.\n\nTime (UTC) Event Opening Remarks Solomon Assefa: Addressing Enterprise Decarbonization and Climate Resiliency Goals with Advances in AI, Cloud, and Quantum Computing (Invited Talk) Details: (click to expand)\n\nSpeaker: Solomon Assefa, IBM Research\n\nTitle: Addressing Enterprise Decarbonization and Climate Resiliency Goals with Advances in AI, Cloud, and Quantum Computing\n\nAbstract: Climate change mitigation and adaptation requires a global response across industries, and the call for action is being amplified by regulatory, investor, and consumer pressure. Over 20% of the world’s largest companies have set long term net-zero and climate resiliency targets. For example, energy and utility companies are planning to make a low-carbon transition and develop climate resilient infrastructure and integrate renewables. Companies spanning various industries want to manage physical asset risk, managing emission hotspots across their supply chain, and demonstrate regulatory compliance.\n\nFurthermore, the financial sector is looking to identify, quantify, monitor risks in their investment portfolio and drive capital management. Hence, enterprises across various industries will need innovative technologies to help them reduce their emissions while building operational resiliency to the impacts of climate change.\n\nThis talk will explore how recent advances in AI, quantum computing, and cloud platforms could be applied towards addressing the aforementioned industry use cases, thereby enabling climate change mitigation and adaptation.\n\nBio: Dr. Solomon Assefa is a Vice President at IBM Research.

These contributions are technical in nature, but they are also in areas of policy, responsible innovation, and social change. I'd like to explore a view on these topics using work from the Royal Society report on digital technology for the planet, decolonial AI, and machine learning for environmental science. Our discussion will interweave the role of data in achieving net zero, the growing interest in digital twins, making better predictions of environmental variables, and deeper considerations of inequality and harms that arise from the coupling of climate change and technology. With this I hope to leave space for our later community discussion on methods and priorities for how we as machine learning researchers can make our contributions to achieving net zero emissions.\n\nBio: Dr Shakir Mohamed works on technical and sociotechnical questions in machine learning research, aspiring to make contributions to machine learning principles, applied problems in healthcare and environment, and ethics and diversity. Shakir is a research scientist and lead at DeepMind in London, an Associate Fellow at the Leverhulme Centre for the Future of Intelligence, and a Honorary Professor of University College London. Shakir is also a founder and trustee of the Deep Learning Indaba, a grassroots organisation aiming to build pan-African capacity and leadership in AI.

Using Machine Learning to Understand Present and Future Climate Changes: an Invitation (Invited Talk) Details: (click to expand)\n\nSpeaker: Kate Marvel, NASA, Columbia University\n\nTitle: Using machine learning to understand present and future climate changes: an invitation\n\nAbstract: In this talk, I'll briefly discuss the standard methods we use to understand the role of external influences like greenhouse gases and aerosols on climate trends and events. Using the ongoing megadrought in the North American Southwest as an example, I'll show how we can disentangle the relative roles of these external \"forcings\" and natural climate variability. I'll discuss some areas in which machine learning might be able to help scientists learn about climate modeling and observations. I hope to start a conversation about the most appropriate role for these techniques.\n\nBio: Dr. Marvel uses climate models, observations, paleoclimate reconstructions, and basic theory to study climate change. Her work has identified human influences on present-day cloud cover, rainfall patterns, and drought risk. She is also interested in future climate changes, particularly climate feedback processes and the planet's sensitivity to increased carbon dioxide. Dr. Marvel teaches in Columbia's MA in Climate and Society Program and writes the \"Hot Planet\" column for Scientific American. Named one of \"15 Women Who Will Save the World\" by Time Magazine, she has been profiled by the New York Times and Rolling Stone, and her 2017 TED talk has been viewed over one million times. Before becoming a climate scientist, she received a PhD in theoretical particle physics from Cambridge University, where she was a Gates scholar.\n\nSpotlight Presentations (81) Manju Murugesu, \"Enhancing Laboratory-scale Flow Imaging of Fractured Geological Media with Deep Learning Super Resolution\" (83) Mark Roth, \"On the Role of Spatial Clustering Algorithms in Building Species Distribution Models from Community Science Data\" (13) Maike Sonnewald, \"Revealing the impact of global warming on climate modes using transparent machine learning and a suite of climate models\" (79) Gyri Reiersen, \"Tackling the Overestimation of Forest Carbon with Deep Learning and Aerial Imagery\" (53) Akansha Singh, \"Designing Bounded min-knapsack Bandits algorithm for Sustainable Demand Response\" Draguna Vrabie: Differentiable Predictive Control (Invited Talk) Details: (click to expand)\n\nSpeaker: Draguna Vrabie, PNNL\n\nTitle: Differentiable Predictive Control\n\nAbstract: Current control technology practice in energy industries implements rule-based controls based on engineering insights. Deep learning control technology can cost-effectively displace current control technology and contribute to climate change mitigation and adaptation. First, I introduce our recent work on modeling dynamic systems with deep learning representations that embed domain knowledge. Next, I will introduce differentiable predictive control (DPC), a data-driven approach that uses physics-informed deep learning representations to synthesize predictive control policies. DPC presents an approximate data-driven solution approach to the explicit Model Predictive Control. Unlike imitation learning approaches, DPC provides neural control policies for time-varying references while satisfying state and input constraints. I illustrate the methodology with application examples of energy-efficient buildings. I conclude with a broader set of control-related problems that machine learning can solve.\n\nBio: Draguna Vrabie is a chief data scientist in the Data Sciences and Machine Intelligence Group at Pacific Northwest National Laboratory. She serves as Team Lead for the Autonomous Learning and Reasoning Team. At the intersection of control system theory and machine learning, her work is on the design of adaptive decision and control systems. Her current focus is on deep learning methodologies and algorithms for high-performance cyber-physical systems. Before joining PNNL in 2015, she was a senior scientist at United Technologies Research Center, East Hartford, Connecticut. Vrabie holds a doctorate in electrical engineering from the University of Texas at Arlington and an ME and BE in automatic control and computer engineering from Gheorghe Asachi Technical University, Iaşi, Romania.\n\nClosing remarks and awards Poster Session 3 Details: (click to expand)\n\nPosters presented in this slot are listed below.\n\nPapers track:\n\n(2) A human-labeled Landsat-8 contrails dataset\n\n(15) Learning Optimal Power Flow with Infeasibility Awareness\n\n(35) DeepPolicyTracker: Tracking Changes In Environmental Policy In The Brazilian Federal Official Gazette With Deep Learning\n\n(41) Reducing Carbon in the Design of Large Infrastructure Scheme with Evolutionary Algorithms\n\n(45) BERT Classification of Paris Agreement Climate Action Plans\n\n(46) Quantification of Carbon Sequestration in Urban Forests\n\n(56) Reconstruction of Long-Term Historical Electricity Demand Data\n\nProposals track:\n\n(65) Powering Effective Climate Communication with a Climate Knowledge Base\n\n(66) Solar PV Maps for Estimation and Forecasting of Distributed Solar Generation\n\n(70) Virtual Screening for Perovskites Discovery\n\n(74) Street2Sat: A Machine Learning Pipeline for Generating Ground-truth Geo-referenced Labeled Datasets from Street-Level Images\n\n(78) MethaNet - an AI-driven approach to quantifying methane point-source emission from high-resolution 2-D plume imagery\n\n(80) Learning Why: Data-Driven Causal Evaluations of Climate Models\n\n(81) Enhancing Laboratory-scale Flow Imaging of Fractured Geological Media with Deep Learning Super Resolution\n\n(85) Reducing greenhouse gas emissions by optimizing room temperature set-points\n\n(88) Leveraging Domain Adaptation for Low-Resource Geospatial Machine Learning\n\nGather.town networking\n\nAccepted Works\n\nWorks were submitted to one of two tracks: Papers or Proposals.\n\nClick the links below for information about each submission, including slides, videos, and papers.\n\nPapers\n\nTitle Authors (1) Examining the nexus of environmental policy, climate physics, and maritime shipping with deep learning models and space-borne data Tianle Yuan (University of Maryland, NASA); Hua Song (NASA, SSAI); Chenxi Wang (University of Maryland, NASA); Kerry Meyer (NASA); Siobhan Light (University of Maryland); Sophia von Hippel (University of Arizona); Steven Platnick (NASA); Lazaros Oreopoulos (NASA); Robert Wood (University of Washington); Hans Mohrmann (University of Washington) (2) A human-labeled Landsat-8 contrails dataset Kevin McCloskey (Google); Scott Geraedts (Google); Brendan Jackman (Google); Vincent R.

Each submission should make clear why the application has (or could have) a pathway to positive impacts regarding climate change. We highly encourage submissions which make their data publicly available. Accepted submissions will be invited to give poster presentations, of which some will be selected for spotlight talks.\n\nThe workshop does not publish proceedings, and submissions are non-archival. Submission to this workshop does not preclude future publication. Previously published work may be submitted under certain circumstances (see the FAQ).\n\nAll submissions must be through the submission website. Submissions will be reviewed double-blind; do your best to anonymize your submission, and do not include identifying information for authors in the PDF. We encourage, but do not require, use of the ICML style template.\n\nPlease see the Tips for Submissions and FAQ, and contact climatechangeai.icml2021@gmail.com with questions.\n\nSubmission Tracks\n\nThere are two tracks for submissions. Submissions are limited to 4 pages for the Papers track, and 3 pages for the Proposals track, in PDF format (see examples from NeurIPS 2020, ICLR 2020, NeurIPS 2019, and ICML 2019). References do not count towards this total. Supplementary appendices are allowed but will be read at the discretion of the reviewers. All submissions must explain why the proposed work has (or could have) positive impacts regarding climate change.\n\nPAPERS Track\n\nWork that is in progress, published, and/or deployed.\n\nSubmissions for the Papers track should describe projects relevant to climate change that involve machine learning. These may include (but are not limited to) academic research; deployed results from startups, industry, public institutions, etc.; and climate-relevant datasets.\n\nSubmissions should provide experimental or theoretical validation of the method presented, as well as specifying what gap the method fills. Authors should clearly illustrate a pathway to climate impact, i.e., identify the way in which this work fits into broader efforts to address climate change. Algorithms need not be novel from a machine learning perspective if they are applied in a novel setting. Details of methodology need not be revealed if they are proprietary, though transparency is highly encouraged.\n\nSubmissions creating novel datasets are welcomed. Datasets should be designed to permit machine learning research (e.g. formatted with clear benchmarks for evaluation). In this case, baseline experimental results on the dataset are preferred, but not required.\n\nPROPOSALS Track\n\nEarly-stage work and detailed descriptions of ideas for future work\n\nSubmissions for the Proposals track should describe detailed ideas for how machine learning can be used to solve climate-relevant problems. While less constrained than the Papers track, Proposals will be subject to a very high standard of review. Ideas should be justified as extensively as possible, including motivation for why the problem being solved is important in tackling climate change, discussion of why current methods are inadequate, explanation of the proposed method, and discussion of the pathway to climate impact. Preliminary results are optional.\n\nTips for Submissions\n\nFor examples of typical formatting and content, see submissions from our previous workshops at NeurIPS 2020, ICLR 2020, NeurIPS 2019, and ICML 2019).\n\nBe explicit: Describe how your proposed approach addresses climate change, demonstrating an understanding of the application area.\n\nFrame your work: The specific problem and/or data proposed should be contextualized in terms of prior work.\n\nAddress the impact: Describe the practical implications of your method in addressing the problem you identify, as well as any relevant societal impacts or potential side-effects. We recommend reading our further guidelines on this aspect here.\n\nExplain the ML: Readers may not be familiar with the exact techniques you are using or may desire further detail.\n\nJustify the ML: Describe why the ML method involved is needed, and why it is a good match for the problem.\n\nAvoid jargon: Jargon is sometimes unavoidable but should be minimized. Ideal submissions will be accessible both to an ML audience and to experts in other relevant fields, without the need for field-specific knowledge. Feel free to direct readers to accessible overviews or review articles for background, where it is impossible to include context directly.\n\nAddressing Impact\n\nTackling climate change requires translating ideas into action. The guidelines below will help you clearly present the importance of your work to a broad audience, hopefully including relevant decision-makers in industry, government, nonprofits, and other areas.\n\nIllustrate the link: Many types of work, from highly theoretical to deeply applied, can have clear pathways to climate impact. Some links may be direct, such as improving solar forecasting to increase utilization within existing electric grids. Others may take several steps to explain, such as improving computer vision techniques for classifying clouds, which could help climate scientists seeking to understand fundamental climate dynamics.\n\nConsider your target audience: Try to convey with relative specificity why and to whom solving the problem at hand will be useful. If studying extreme weather prediction, consider how you would communicate your key findings to a government disaster response agency. If analyzing a supply chain optimization pilot program, what are the main takeaways for industries who might adopt this technology? To ensure your work will be impactful, where possible we recommend co-developing projects with relevant stakeholders or reaching out to them early in the process for feedback. We encourage you to use this opportunity to do so!\n\nOutline key metrics: Quantitative or qualitative assessments of how well your results (or for proposals, anticipated results) compare to existing methods are encouraged. Try to give a sense of the importance of your problem and your findings. We encourage you to convey why the particular metrics you choose are relevant from a climate change perspective. For instance, if you are evaluating your machine learning model on the basis of accuracy, how does improved accuracy on a machine learning model translate to climate impact, and why is accuracy the best metric to use in this context?\n\nBe clear and concise: The discussion of impact does not need to be lengthy, just clear.\n\nConvey the big picture: Ultimately, the goal of Climate Change AI is to “empower work that meaningfully addresses the climate crisis.” Try to make sure that from the beginning, you contextualize your method and its impacts in terms of this objective.\n\nMentorship Program\n\nWe are hosting a mentorship program to facilitate exchange between potential workshop submitters and experts working in topic areas relevant to the workshop. The goal of this program is to foster cross-disciplinary collaborations and ultimately increase the quality and potential impact of submitted work.\n\nExpectations:\n\nMentors are expected to guide mentees during the CCAI mentorship program as they prepare submissions for this workshop.\n\nExamples of mentor-mentee interactions may include:\n\nIn-depth discussion of relevant related work in the area of the Paper or Proposal, to ensure submissions are well-framed and contextualized in terms of prior work.\n\nIterating on the core idea of a Proposal to ensure that the climate change application is well-posed and the ML techniques used are well-suited.\n\nGiving feedback on the writing or presentation of a Paper or Proposal to bring it to the right level of maturity for submission.\n\nMentees are expected to initiate contact with their assigned mentor and put in the work and effort necessary to prepare a Paper or Proposal submission by May 31.\n\nWe suggest that after the mentor-mentee matching is made, a first (physical or digital) meeting should take place within the first week (May 1-8) to discuss the Paper or Proposal and set expectations for the mentorship period. Subsequent interactions can take place either through meetings or via email discussions, following the expectations set during the initial meeting, culminating in a final version of a Paper or Proposal submitted via the CMT portal by May 31.\n\nMentors and mentees must abide by the following Code of Conduct: https://www.climatechange.ai/code_of_conduct.\n\nApplication\n\nApplications are due by April 28.\n\nApplication to be a mentee: https://cmt3.research.microsoft.com/CCAIMICML2021\n\nApplication to be a mentor: https://forms.gle/efYnYF7zKrHqLuJe7\n\nFrequently Asked Questions\n\nMentorship Program FAQ\n\nQ: Are mentors allowed to be authors on the paper for which they provided mentorship?\n\nA: Yes, mentors can be co-authors but not reviewers.\n\nQ: What happens if the mentor/mentee does not fulfill their duties, or if major issues come up?\n\nA: Please email us at climatechangeai.icml2021@gmail.com and we will do our best to help resolve the situation. Potential breaches of the Code of Conduct will be responded to promptly as detailed therein.\n\nQ: What happens if I apply to be a mentee but do not get paired with a mentor?\n\nA: While we will do our best, we cannot guarantee pairings for everyone. Even if you do not get paired with a mentor, we encourage you to submit a Paper or Proposal to the workshop, and our reviewers will provide you with guidance and feedback on how to improve it.\n\nQ: What happens if my submission does not get accepted to the workshop?\n\nA: While the mentorship program is meant to give early-career researchers and students the opportunity to improve the quality of their work, sometimes submissions will need further polishing and elaboration before being ready for presentation at a CCAI workshop. If this is the case, we invite you to take into account the comments made by the reviewers and to resubmit again to a subsequent CCAI workshop.\n\nQ: I cannot guarantee that I can commit at least 4 hours to the program over the time period. Should I still apply as a mentor?\n\nA: No. While the 4 hour time commitment is a suggestion, we do believe that it is necessary to ensure that all mentees receive the help and guidance they need.\n\nQ: I do not have a background in machine learning; can I still apply to be a mentor/mentee?\n\nA: Yes! We welcome applications from domains that are complementary to machine learning to solve the problems that we are targeting.\n\nQ: What happens if my mentor/mentee wants to continue meeting after the workshop?\n\nA: We welcome and encourage continued interactions after the official mentorship period. That said, neither the mentor nor the mentee should feel obligated to maintain contact.\n\nSubmission FAQ\n\nQ: How can I keep up to date on this kind of stuff?\n\nA: Sign up for our mailing list!\n\nQ: I’m not in machine learning. Can I still submit?\n\nA: Yes, absolutely! We welcome submissions from many fields. Do bear in mind, however, that the majority of attendees of the workshop will have a machine learning background; therefore, other fields should be introduced sufficiently to provide context for the work.\n\nQ: What if my submission is accepted but I can’t attend the workshop?\n\nA: You may ask someone else to present your work in your stead.\n\nQ: Do I need to use LaTeX or the ICML style files?\n\nA: No, although we encourage it.\n\nQ: It’s hard for me to fit my submission on 3 or 4 pages. What should I do?\n\nA: Feel free to include appendices with additional material (these should be part of the same PDF file as the main submission). Do not, however, put essential material in an appendix, as it will be read at the discretion of the reviewers.\n\nQ: Can I send submissions directly by email?\n\nA: No, please use the CMT website to make submissions.\n\nQ: The submission website is asking for my name. Is this a problem for anonymization?\n\nA: You should fill out your name and other info when asked on the submission website; CMT will keep your submission anonymous to reviewers.\n\nQ: Do submissions for the Proposals track need to have experimental validation?\n\nA: No, although some initial experiments or citation of published results would strengthen your submission.\n\nQ: The submission website never sent me a confirmation email. Is this a problem?\n\nA: No, the CMT system does not send automatic confirmation emails after a submission, though the submission should show up on the CMT page once submitted. If in any doubt regarding the submission process, please contact the organizers. Also please avoid making multiple submissions of the same article to CMT.\n\nQ: Can I submit previously published work to this workshop?\n\nA: Yes, though under limited circumstances. In particular, work that has previously been published at non-machine learning venues may be eligible for submission; however, work that has been published in conferences on machine learning or related fields is likely not eligible. If your work was previously accepted to a Climate Change AI workshop, this work should have changed or matured substantively to be eligible for resubmission. Please contact climatechangeai.icml2021@gmail.com with any questions."
