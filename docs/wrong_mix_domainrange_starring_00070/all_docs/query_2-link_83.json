        "text": "(light music) (thunderous pounding) (creature bellowing) >> Steve: This is Tokyo, once a city of six million people.\n\nWhat has happened here was caused by a force which, up until a few days ago, was entirely beyond the scope of man's imagination.\n\nTokyo, a smoldering memorial to the unknown an unknown which, at this very moment, still prevails and could at any time lash out with its terrible destruction anywhere else in the world.\n\nThere were once many people here who could have told of what they saw.\n\nNow there are only a few.\n\nMy name is Steve Martin.\n\nI'm a foreign correspondent for United World News.\n\nI was headed for an assignment in Cairo when I stopped off in Tokyo for a social call.\n\nBut it turned out to be a visit to the living hell of another world.\n\n(dramatic music) Emergency hospitals were overflowing with the maimed and the dead.\n\nFor the living, the horror of last night was over.\n\nThe only thought left was the paralyzing fear that it could happen again today, or tomorrow.\n\n(Geiger counter clicking) Everyone who had survived without serious injury was helping to repair the human wreckage.\n\nOne of the survivors was Emiko Yamane, the daughter of Japan's famous paleontologist.\n\nFor some of the victims, there was hope.\n\nFor others, there would be no tomorrow.\n\n(child wailing) I don't know how many hours went by before an auxiliary hospital unit found me.\n\nI knew it was daylight.\n\nI was surprised to be alive.\n\nThe odor of scorched flesh permeated the air.\n\nThe sight of all the helpless human wreckage snapped me back to stark reality.\n\n(wailing continues) (woman sobbing) Emiko.\n\nEmiko!\n\n>> Steve.\n\nSteve Martin.\n\nAre you badly hurt?\n\n>> After last night, I'm lucky to be alive.\n\n>> I guess we're all living on borrowed time.\n\nOh, Steve, what brought this upon us?\n\n>> I don't know, Emiko.\n\nI don't know.\n\nYour father, is he all right?\n\n>> Yes.\n\nHe's meeting with the security officials now.\n\n(groans) Don't move, Steve.\n\nI'll try to get a doctor for you.\n\n>> Steve: It was still hard for me to believe that I could be lying here in a hospital alive when I think of the thousands of others dead and dying in the ruins around me.\n\nWhen I think back, only a few days ago I was en route to Cairo with a few days' layover in Tokyo.\n\nI was looking forward to a visit with an old college friend, Dr. Serizawa a theoretical scientist who was gaining great recognition in the Far East for his unusual experiments.\n\nWhile I was unaware of it at the time 10,000 feet below, an incident was about to take place that would shake the foundations of the civilized world.\n\n(upbeat music) (explosions booming) (man exclaims) (men clamoring) (creature bellowing) (all screaming) (morse code beeping) This morning, it would have been impossible for anyone to convince me that I would ever see Tokyo like this again.\n\n>> Pardon.\n\nYou are Mr. Steve Martin?\n\n>> Yes.\n\n>> I'm Shigeo Ioto, assistant to Dr. Serizawa.\n\n>> Oh, how do you do?\n\nAnd how is Serizawa?\n\nHis health is fine, but he regrets not being here to meet you.\n\n>> Something wrong?\n\n>> Dr. Serizawa had to go inland on some field experiments.\n\nHe wanted to delay them until after your visit but they were much too important.\n\nHe hopes that you understand.\n\n>> Of course.\n\nOh, when's he planning to return?\n\n>> Perhaps before your departure to Cairo.\n\nMeanwhile, if there's anything I can do, please feel free to call me.\n\n>> I certainly will.\n\n(man speaking Japanese) (man speaking Japanese) >> I'm sorry, Mr. Martin, but we must ask you to come to the security office for questioning.\n\n>> Is this a polite way of telling me I'm under arrest?\n\n>> No, no arrest.\n\nJust questioning.\n\nBut it is imperative that you come.\n\n>> Of course.\n\n>> I'll take your bag.\n\nHotel Mikasu?\n\n>> No.\n\nStill the Imperial.\n\n>> Announcer: Flight 104 is arriving at ramp seven.\n\n(man speaking Japanese) >> How do you do, Mr. Martin?\n\n>> Mr. Iwanaga.\n\n>> During your flight last night, did anything unusual occur?\n\n>> Well, I didn't notice anything.\n\nI was busy writing and reading, and the rest of the time I was sleeping.\n\n>> Oh, I see.\n\n>> I understand you've questioned everyone on my flight.\n\nWhat is it you're trying to find out?\n\nI represent United World News.\n\n>> I don't know, Mr. Martin.\n\nI don't know whether it should be printed or not.\n\n>> I don't follow you.\n\n>> You see, we don't know what it is we're dealing with.\n\nAt 3:30 this morning, a ship from Tokyo was literally wiped from the surface of the ocean in a matter of seconds.\n\n>> Anything from the ship's radio?\n\n>> It said there was a blinding flash of light and the ocean burst into flame.\n\n>> Could have been a mine or a collision.\n\n>> Why would the radio men not report a mine or a collision?\n\n>> That's a good point.\n\nWell, whatever's being done I'd like to find out about.\n\n>> All right.\n\nCome with me.\n\n(man speaking Japanese over radio) (people clamoring) This is the chart room of the Nankai Steamship Company.\n\nIt was their ship which was sunk.\n\n(men speaking Japanese) >> You mind telling me what they're discussing?\n\n>> They're at a loss to explain how their ship could disappear so suddenly.\n\n(man speaking Japanese) >> Any survivors?\n\n>> No, not yet.\n\nThey're in direct contact with the rescue ship now.\n\nIt should arrive at the scene of the sinking in a few hours.\n\n(horn blows) (excited chattering in Japanese) >> Operator, give me Paul, please.\n\nRush.\n\nPaul?\n\n(speaking Portuguese) >> That's it, operator.\n\nMr. George Lawrence, United World News Chicago, U.S.A. Japanese ship disasters puzzle world.\n\nEight ships obliterated by mysterious blinding flash of fire.\n\nNo survivors found.\n\nRadio reports from stricken ships gave same message.\n\nThat's right.\n\nTerrible sea of fire engulfs all.\n\nStaggering death toll forces all shipping schedules be canceled.\n\nWill remain Tokyo unless word from you.\n\nSign it Steve Martin.\n\nYou've got it.\n\nThanks.\n\nLike a creeping illness, panic began to spread all over Japan.\n\nThe Nankai Shipping Company swarmed with distraught families pleading for news of lost crews.\n\n(man speaking Japanese) (all shouting) (men speaking Japanese) The few survivors who had been found died in a matter of minutes from shock and strange burns.\n\n(morse code beeping) (crowd clamoring) (man speaking Japanese) With disaster following disaster, the terror-stricken people demanded action be taken.\n\nSecurity officials and scientists were called together.\n\nDr. Yamane, Japan's leading paleontologist was among the top scientists invited to the meeting.\n\nI had met Dr. Yamane through my friend Serizawa several years ago.\n\nIf there was to be an answer to these mysterious ship disasters it would come from these men.\n\n(men speaking Japanese) I'm afraid my Japanese is a little rusty.\n\n(man speaking Japanese) >> Dr. Yamane is suggesting to the officials that they question the natives of a small island.\n\nHe says that Odo Island is close to the area where the disasters have taken place.\n\n>> Steve: Odo Island, a bleak spot of land in the Pacific populated with several hundred natives who were now half paralyzed with fear.\n\n(man speaking Japanese) (murmuring excitedly) These people were the only ones who had seen some of the fires at sea.\n\n(people shouting) (chattering excitedly) (shouting in Japanese) (chattering excitedly) They were also the only ones who saw a survivor of the sinkings and his visit was a short one.\n\n(shouting in Japanese) (man speaking Japanese) (shouting) (aircraft roaring) The next morning, a helicopter was dispatched from Tokyo.\n\nThe security officer, Mr. Iwanaga, had arranged for me to join the group of officials who were to question the natives of Odo Island.\n\nWhile various natives of the island were being interrogated by the officials, Tomo and I went out among the natives.\n\n(men speaking Japanese) Hey, Tomo, we make him mad?\n\n>> He's frightened.\n\nHe's terribly frightened.\n\n>> He must've seen something.\n\n>> He claimed he saw a monster, a horrible monster.\n\n>> If he saw a monster, he's had too much sake.\n\n>> No, no, Mr. Martin.\n\nThese island people are very superstitious.\n\n>> Well, let's see what else we can find out.\n\nIt was decided that we'd spend the night and it gave me an opportunity to witness a rare ceremony one that was all but forgotten.\n\n>> The island people are beset by many dangers, Steve, some real, some imagined.\n\nThis ceremony is dedicated to one such danger.\n\nThere's a legend among the island people that somewhere off their shores there exists a monster too terrible for a mortal to conceive.\n\nMany centuries ago, they used to send a young girl out on a raft each year as a sacrifice.\n\n>> What's the name of this monster?\n\n>> Godzilla.\n\nGodzilla!\n\n(man speaking Japanese) >> Did you hear that?\n\nGodzilla.\n\n>> They believe their, uh, Godzilla is responsible for all these ship disasters?\n\n>> They're certain of it.\n\n(wind gusting) (thunderous pounding in distance) (all speaking Japanese) (boy shouting in Japanese) (shouts) (creature bellowing) (thunderous pounding) (creature bellowing) (boy shouting) (all shouting) >> Steve: It was more than wind, rain, and lightning.\n\nMuch more.\n\nI wasn't just sure what it was.\n\nNo one was sure.\n\nNo one except the natives, and they were positive.\n\nThey said it was Godzilla.\n\nThe next morning, the officials brought some of the islanders back to Tokyo to make a direct report.\n\n(chattering in Japanese) (man speaking Japanese) Each of the natives of Odo Island told his own story of the sudden turbulence and had his own ideas of its cause.\n\nThey were all of the opinion that the destruction was brought about by a living creature.\n\n(man speaking Japanese) (audience applauding) >> I have not been to the island myself but the world today is filled with many mysteries.\n\nIn the Himalayas, footprints of snowmen have been found.\n\nNo one knows anything about them so there's no one who can explain a phenomenon at the top of the world.\n\nIs it not possible that some other unexplainable phenomenon might exist at the bottom of the ocean?\n\nA research party should be organized to make a scientific survey of Odo Island.\n\n(people applauding) >> I'm going to catch Dr. Yamane.\n\nI'll see you later.\n\nIt seems to me there are still forces left in this world that none of us can understand.\n\n(man speaking Japanese) Oh, excuse me.\n\n(people chattering) Dr. Yamane.\n\n>> Steve Martin.\n\nIt is good to see you.\n\n>> You take this monster talk seriously?\n\n>> Who can tell?\n\n>> I understand you're heading the research group to Odo Island.\n\n>> Yes.\n\nWe leave this afternoon.\n\n>> With your permission, I'd like to come.\n\nI've been cleared by the security office.\n\n>> Of course.\n\nPier J at 2:00.\n\n>> Good.\n\nI'll see you then.\n\n(people shouting) (upbeat music) Pier J swarmed with well-wishers for Dr. Yamane and his party.\n\n(shouting continues) (horn blowing) (all speaking Japanese) But there was still a feeling of anxiety among us all for every ship that had taken this course had vanished from the face of the earth.\n\nYes, there was a feeling of anxiety.\n\nBut perhaps the two exceptions were Emiko and a young marine officer named Ogata.\n\nAt the moment, they seemed more interested in each other.\n\nWhen I'd last seen Emiko she had just become engaged to Dr. Serizawa.\n\nIt was the usual triangle only this time it was to play an important part in the lives of millions of people.\n\n(man speaking Japanese) (Geiger counter clicking) >> This well is contaminated.\n\nPlease stay back.\n\nThis ground is dangerous!\n\n(people exclaiming) >> Mr. Ojihara, these are footsteps of a living creature.\n\n(flashbulb pops) (rapid clicking) >> They're also radioactive.\n\nThis ground is dangerous!\n\nEverybody, please stay back!\n\n(crowd chattering) >> Emiko, a trilobite, a three-ringed worm which was thought to be extinct.\n\n>> Don't hold it in your bare hands!\n\n>> What does that mean?\n\n>> It's a fabulous discovery.\n\n>> Trilobite?\n\nIsn't that a- (bell clanging) >> Godzilla!\n\n(shouting) >> What's that, Tomo?\n\n>> It's safer up on the hills.\n\n(panicked shouting) (thunderous pounding) (all screaming) (Godzilla roaring) (woman screams) (Godzilla roaring) (Godzilla roaring) >> Emiko!\n\nEmiko!\n\nEmiko!\n\n(crowd shouting) >> Emiko!\n\nOgata!\n\n(panicked chattering) (man shouts in Japanese) (men speaking Japanese) >> Look at the size of those footprints!\n\n>> It can safely be assumed that two million years ago this brontosaurus and other ancient reptiles roamed the earth.\n\nIt was known as the Jurassic age.\n\nDuring this period, there was another species which we may call the intermediary animal a cross between the land-living and the sea-living animals.\n\nLet us call this creature Godzilla, according to the legend of Odo Island.\n\nAnd judging from this photograph this creature is over 400 feet tall.\n\n(all murmuring) (man exclaiming in Japanese) Of course, the question we are asking ourselves is how this animal happened to reappear after all these centuries and so near to the coast of Japan.\n\nOne answer could be that some rare phenomenon of nature allowed this breed of the Jurassic age to reproduce itself and for a long span of time, it had no reason to reappear to the world.\n\nBut now that analysis of radioactivity of the creature's footprint shows the existence of strontium 90, a product of the H-bomb, it is my belief that Godzilla was resurrected due to the repeated experiments of H-bombs.\n\n(people murmuring) (speaking Japanese) (people shouting) >> Hello?\n\n>> Can you hear me okay, George?\n\n>> You're comin' in clear.\n\nNow, let's have it, Steve.\n\nWhat about this monster story of yours?\n\n>> Well, it's big and terrible, more frightening than I ever thought possible.\n\n>> You realize your story's front-page all over the country?\n\nWe want to know what's being done about this monster.\n\n>> Well, here's your headline: \"Security Decides to Use Depth Bomb on Godzilla.\"\n\n>> Oh, that's fine.\n\nBut how can they use depth bombs against something they can't even see?\n\n>> Same way they look for a submarine: sonar.\n\nOh, they'll find him, all right.\n\nThe big question is, will they kill him?\n\n>> Well, stay on it, Steve, and keep us posted.\n\n>> I will.\n\nSo long, George.\n\n(phone ringing) >> Hello?\n\n(speaking Japanese) Steve, you are a better newspaperman than a linguist.\n\nIt is good to hear from you.\n\n>> I just got the message that you called.\n\nDid you finish with your experiments?\n\n>> Yes, I finished.\n\n>> Good.\n\nLet's have dinner tonight.\n\n>> Steve, make it tomorrow.\n\nEmiko is coming over this evening, and she said it was important.\n\n>> All right.\n\nI'll check with you tomorrow.\n\n>> That will be fine, Steve.\n\n>> Sayonara.\n\nThe marriage between Emiko and Dr. Serizawa had been arranged when they were both children.\n\nAnd while Emiko wasn't in love with the great scientist she had great respect and admiration for him.\n\nIt proved difficult for her to tell him she was going to marry Ogata.\n\n>> It...\n\nIt's good to have you home, Dr. Serizawa.\n\n>> It is good to be back, Emiko.\n\n>> I'm glad we have this time together.\n\nThere is something important I must tell you.\n\n>> But there is something far more important which I must show you.\n\n>> Eh?\n\n>> Come with me.\n\n(murmurs agreement) (machinery humming) (exclaims) (machine whirring) Stand back!\n\n(Emiko screams) Emiko-san!\n\nThe world must not know of this.\n\nPromise to keep my secret.\n\n(murmurs agreement) >> I won't even tell my father.\n\n>> What happened?\n\n>> Nothing.\n\nNothing.\n\n(upbeat music) (explosion booms) (explosion booms) (explosions continue) Father, what is it?\n\n>> They are so wrong.\n\nGodzilla should not be destroyed.\n\nHe should be studied.\n\nEmiko, please, leave me alone.\n\n>> Hai.\n\n>> Steve: By the end of the day, it was generally assumed that the underwater demolition had ended the short but terrible reign of Godzilla.\n\nThere was a feeling of relief throughout Tokyo, even celebration.\n\nBut both the hope and celebration were short-lived.\n\n(tropical music) (thunderous pounding) (woman gasps) (Godzilla roaring) (people screaming) >> Godzilla!\n\n(screaming continues) (panicked shouting) >> Steve: Within minutes, the city was aware that Godzilla was inside Tokyo Harbor.\n\nAmong the people, there was a state of panic.\n\n(man speaking Japanese) The military used every man and machine available in an effort to stem the oncoming terror.\n\n(dramatic music) >> Has Emiko returned?\n\n>> Emiko: Hai.\n\n(klaxon siren sounds) (thunderous pounding) (man speaking Japanese) Ogata-san!\n\nI couldn't tell Dr. Serizawa about us.\n\nI understand, Emiko.\n\n(pounding continues) (Godzilla roaring) (guns blasting) (sirens wailing) (dramatic music) >> Let's go up on the hill.\n\n(shouting in Japanese) (dramatic music) (people screaming) (people laughing) (people screaming) >> He's leaving!\n\n(Godzilla roaring) >> But he will be back.\n\n>> Steve: The damage had been severe, but fortunately confined to the dock section of the city.\n\nGodzilla was still in Tokyo Bay and there was every reason to believe he would return unless some means was found to stop him.\n\n(man speaking Japanese) >> Steve.\n\nHey, Steve.\n\n>> Hi, Tomo.\n\n>> What did you run out of the meeting for?\n\n>> Got to get this story off to the paper.\n\nAnything happen after I left?\n\n>> Yes.\n\nThey're making one last big effort to stop him.\n\n>> And what's that?\n\n>> Come here.\n\nI'll show you.\n\nTokyo is surrounded by high-tension electrical towers.\n\nTo get to the heart of the city, Godzilla would have to break through 300,000 volts of electricity.\n\nThe officials are trying to have everything ready by nightfall.\n\nNow I must report back to my station.\n\n>> All right.\n\nAnd thanks, Tomo.\n\n>> So long, Steve.\n\n>> Sayonara.\n\n>> Steve: The security officials ordered a general evacuation of all nonessential personnel.\n\nIt was a monumental job, but a job which had to be done.\n\n(panicked shouting) (man speaking over P.A.\n\nin Japanese) By nightfall, everyone was off the streets.\n\nThe news office commanded a good view of Tokyo and was receiving all reports directly from security headquarters.\n\nThis tape recording is for George Lawrence, United World News, Chicago, U.S.A. Everyone remaining in the city was on a watch-and-wait basis.\n\nThe wait was not a long one.\n\n(dramatic music) George, here in Tokyo, time has been turned back two million years.\n\nThis is my report as it happens.\n\nA prehistoric monster the Japanese call Godzilla has just walked out of Tokyo Bay.\n\nHe's as tall as a 30-story building.\n\nAnd now he's making his way toward the city's main line of defense: 300,000 volts of electricity strung around the city as a barrier, a barrier against Godzilla.\n\n(buzzer blares) (Godzilla roaring) (guns blasting) (Godzilla roaring) I can hardly believe what has just happened.\n\nNow it seems Tokyo has no defense.\n\n(Godzilla roaring) (dramatic music) (panicked shouting) (screaming) (sirens wailing) They're moving an entire tank corps to point-blank firing range.\n\nI'm saying a prayer, George, a prayer for the whole world.\n\n(tanks blasting) George, the tanks have been wiped out by a wall of flames.\n\nNeither man nor his machines are able to stop this creature.\n\n(people screaming) (man speaking Japanese) (Godzilla roaring) (shouts in Japanese) (man screams) (panicked shouting) (shouting continues) (Godzilla roaring) (dramatic music) Godzilla has turned the heart of Tokyo into a sea of fire.\n\nBeneath the flames, thousands lie dead or dying.\n\n(clock tolling) (men speaking Japanese) (Godzilla roaring) (people screaming) Nothing can save the city now.\n\n(Godzilla roaring) (man speaking over P.A.\n\nin Japanese) (buildings crashing) This is it, George.\n\n(Godzilla roaring) Steve Martin signing off from Tokyo, Japan.\n\n(Godzilla roaring) (dramatic music) (woman speaking Japanese) (announcer speaking Japanese) (Godzilla roaring) (aircraft roaring) (frantic music) (woman screaming) (woman sobbing) >> Watch it!\n\nHi, Emiko.\n\n>> You've been sleeping very nervously.\n\n>> Hello, Ogata.\n\n>> Hello, Steve.\n\n>> Anything new develop?\n\n>> Nothing new will develop unless- >> Unless what?\n\n>> I was shown a terrible secret, which is probably the only weapon which could destroy Godzilla.\n\n>> What is it?\n\n>> I promised Dr. Serizawa never to reveal his secret to anyone.\n\n>> Emiko.\n\nEmiko, last night Tokyo was destroyed.\n\nTomorrow it might be Osaka or Yokohama.\n\nIf you can help, you must.\n\n>> When I went to see Dr. Serizawa I had intended to tell him about Ogata and me, but there was something he wanted to show me first.\n\n(man speaking Japanese) (Emiko screams) Dr. Serizawa had been experimenting with oxygen when he came upon a terrible chemical discovery, a way to destroy all oxygen in water, thereby disintegrating all living matter.\n\nAn amount no larger than a baseball could turn Tokyo Bay into a graveyard.\n\nSerizawa had found a terrible destructive power, and until he could find a counteracting good that would come from this discovery, he didn't want the world to know his secret.\n\n(both speaking Japanese) (liquid bubbling) He made me promise never to tell what I had seen.\n\n>> Emiko, we need Serizawa's help.\n\nThere's no other way.\n\n>> If I could only see him, just talk to him.\n\n>> Perhaps I can change his mind.\n\nOgata will go with me.\n\n>> Whatever you do, Emiko, you mustn't fail.\n\n>> Serizawa-san.\n\n>> Sit down.\n\n>> Doctor, I know of your Oxygen Destroyer.\n\nWe must have it.\n\n>> I don't know what you are talking about!\n\n>> I broke my promise, Serizawa.\n\nI told Steve Martin and Ogata.\n\nThey both agree.\n\nYou must use your Oxygen Destroyer against Godzilla.\n\n(sobbing) >> No.\n\n>> Serizawa-san!\n\nSerizawa-san!\n\nAh, Serizawa-san!\n\n>> Let go!\n\n>> We must have the formula!\n\nWe must!\n\n>> Let go!\n\n>> Please stop!\n\n(men shouting) (glass clattering) (Emiko screams) >> Serizawa-san!\n\n>> Ogata-san!\n\nOgata-san!\n\n>> Sorry, Ogata.\n\nThe Oxygen Destroyer cannot be used.\n\n>> If we don't defend ourselves from Godzilla now, what will become of us?\n\n>> And what will become of us if a weapon such as I now have falls into the wrong hands?\n\n>> Then you have a responsibility no man has ever faced.\n\nYou have your fear, which might become reality, and you have Godzilla, which is reality.\n\n(gasps) >> Announcer: Attention.\n\nAttention, people of Japan.\n\nAt this moment, a nationwide prayer is being observed for the survivors of devastated Tokyo.\n\nThe voices of our children are raised in a prayer for the courage to surmount the destruction of today and look forward with hope for peace and light.\n\n(choir singing in Japanese) Have you decided?\n\n>> Yes, but this must be the only time the Oxygen Destroyer will be used.\n\n(Emiko sobbing) (upbeat music) (Geiger counter clicking) >> Steve: The boat finding the location of Godzilla the Oxygen Destroyer, all these have been accomplished.\n\nSerizawa insisted upon helping Ogata place the weapon.\n\n>> And now the divers are descending.\n\nWe ask the whole world to stand by.\n\n(somber music) >> They have reached the bottom.\n\n(men shouting in Japanese) >> Serizawa!\n\nSerizawa!\n\nSerizawa!\n\n>> Announcer: One diver is up.\n\nIt is Ogata.\n\nDr. Serizawa has not yet started his ascent.\n\n(excited chattering) (water churning loudly) (somber music) Serizawa!\n\nSerizawa-san!\n\n(man speaking Japanese) >> Ogata, it is working!\n\nLive happily with Emiko.\n\nGood-bye.\n\n>> Serizawa!\n\nPull the line up!\n\nAnswer me!\n\nSerizawa!\n\n>> Serizawa!\n\n(Godzilla bellowing) (people murmuring) >> Announcer: People of the world, Godzilla is dead.\n\nGive us strength to rebuild our beloved land.\n\n(Emiko weeping) >> He said, \"Be happy together.\"\n\n(Emiko sobbing) >> Steve: The menace was gone.\n\nSo was a great man.\n\nBut the whole world could wake up and live again.\n\n(somber music) (thunderous pounding)"
