        "text": "The Carney Center for Computational Brain Science and the BRAINSTORM Program is organizing a two-week computational modeling workshop with a focus on computational modeling of cognition, behavior, and brain/behavior relationships. Workshop attendees will learn the basic tools for understanding, developing, and applying models to brain science questions, and have the opportunity to apply these techniques in a novel behavioral dataset.\n\nWeek 1 will consist of workshops and live tutorials, including daily lectures spanning basic to advanced topics, accompanied by hands-on coding tutorials. Attendees will learn the basic tools for understanding, developing and applying computational models, with a focus on hypothesis testing, quantitative fitting, Bayesian methods, and model checks and comparisons. Additionally, advanced modeling sessions will provide a deeper theoretical understanding and application of complex modeling techniques.\n\nDuring Week 2, participants will have the opportunity to work in teams to apply these skills to analyze a real dataset provided by the organizers, with potential for novel discoveries. Prizes will be awarded for models with the most predictive power, rigor, creativity, and innovation.\n\nFor details on last years’ workshops and modeling competition, visit the Center for Computational Brain Science website. Previous syllabi are available here. We will cover most of the same basic topics, with a few tweaks and additions (based on participant input and guest speakers).\n\nNote: The organizers will host a follow-up workshop on an advanced topic “Automated Scientific Discovery” from July 29 - August 2 at the Institute of Cognitive Science in Osnabrück, Germany. You get more information and sign up for this workshop here.\n\nIntended Audience: This workshop is open to the members of the Brown community, and is designed for researchers across fields, backgrounds and levels of experience: computation “novices” with no experience and those with more computational experience who may want to augment their toolkit with advanced approaches to parameter estimation or specific classes of models. Although there is no computational experience required, those with modeling backgrounds will still benefit from the advanced modules, and will have the opportunity to learn new skills and state-of-the-art computational approaches.\n\nMaximum number of participants: Participation is limited to 20, but we do keep a waitlist.\n\nOrganizers: Sebastian Musslick, Younes Strittmatter, Michael J. Frank\n\nContact: Please reach out to Sebastian Musslick ([email protected]) with any questions.\n\nWe are pleased to invite you to a virtual workshop on the Human Neocortical Neurosolver (HNN), jointly organized by the Stephanie Jones Lab and MetaCell, scheduled for May 8th. The workshop is aimed at researchers and clinicians with an interest in neuroscience but without formal computational modeling or coding experience. It will offer a detailed exploration of HNN, a tool designed to interpret the neural origins of human MEG/EEG data.\n\nWorkshop Highlights:\n\nComprehensive Overview: The workshop will begin with a didactic presentation on the background and development of HNN, providing a foundation for its application in neuroscience research.\n\nPractical Application: Participants will learn how to utilize the HNN graphical user interface (GUI) to investigate the circuit origins of commonly measured signals, including event-related potentials (ERPs) and low-frequency brain rhythms.\n\nAdvanced Interface Training: Discover how to use the HNN-core Python interface.\n\nWorkshops Hosts:\n\nStephanie Jones, PhD\n\nMainak Jas, PhD\n\nNicholas Tolley\n\nRyan Thorpe\n\nDylan Daniels\n\nAbout the Workshop Content:\n\nMEG/EEG signals are correlated with several healthy and pathological brain functions. However, it is still extremely difficult to infer their underlying cellular and circuit level origins. This limits the translation of MEG/EEG signals into novel principles of information processing, or into new treatment methods for pathologies. To address this limitation, we have built the Human Neocortical Neurosolver (HNN): an open-source software tool to help researchers and clinicians without formal computational modeling or coding experience interpret the neural origin of their human MEG/EEG data.\n\nHNN provides a graphical user interface (GUI) and a programmable Python interface to an anatomically and biophysically detailed model of a neocortical circuit, with layer specific thalamocortical and cortical-cortical drives. Tutorials are provided to teach users how to begin to study the cell and circuit level origin of sensory event related potentials (ERPs) and low frequency rhythms in the alpha, beta and gamma band, based on our prior publications.\n\nUnique to HNN is an underlying neural model that accounts for the biophysics generating the primary electric currents underlying EEG/MEG signals, enabling visual and statistical comparison of model output to source localized data from a single brain area (in nAm). Users can change model parameters in the GUI for testing hypotheses on signal differences under varied experimental conditions. Further, visualizations are shown of detailed circuit activity including layer-specific responses, cell spiking activity, and membrane voltages.\n\nWe look forward to introducing you to our one-of-a-kind tool for cell and circuit interpretation of MEG/EEG!\n\nRegistration Information:\n\nThe workshop will take place online on Wednesday, May 8th from 9am to noon ET. It is limited to 20 participants to ensure a productive learning environment. Given the specialized nature of this workshop, we anticipate high interest. To secure your participation, we recommend registering as soon as possible. A registration fee of $25.00 is required to help us cover the costs of organizing the event.\n\n“Empowering Career Growth and Professional Resilience Through Strategic Networking” is a workshop facilitated by Mari Anne Snow, CEO/Founder, Sophaya and the Remote Nation Institute (RNI) and Dr. Katherine M.

To identify the mechanisms and circuits underlying this computation, I study the neurobiology of decision-making. Humans and other primates predominantly use vision to gather information, and therefore, I use nonhuman primates as a model for studying the neural correlates of decisions communicated by eye movements. I designed novel tasks that deconstruct the decision process to understand (i) how the decision can be paused and resumed after interruptions and (ii) how the decision can be terminated to be reported later. While the monkey was engaged in these tasks, I recorded tens to hundreds of neurons simultaneously from the parietal cortex. When a decision is interrupted by intervening eye movements and needs to be updated, I demonstrated the population of parietal neurons represents the decision continuously without interruption—by transferring decision-related activity from neuron to neuron across intervening eye movements.\n\nFurthermore, I showed that if the termination of a decision is separate from the expression of the decision, different groups of parietal neurons represent the When and What of the decision. Yet, these representations are correlated on single trials, suggesting the When and What of a decision remain coupled via a single evidence accumulation process. Together, my results reveal the building blocks of the decision process and how these units are put together to guide flexible behavior. Based on my findings, I hypothesize that behavioral flexibility can be explained by the many ways neurons can communicate within and across brain areas to cater to various task demands. My future research will test this hypothesis by probing hundreds of neurons simultaneously from the parietal and frontal areas while the monkey makes decisions under varying task demands:\n\n1. Different information types (i.e., value and sensory).\n\n2. Different rules or contexts.\n\n3. Different ways to gather information.\n\nMy research benefits from the latest innovation in neurotechnology for probing neural populations and the set of sophisticated analyses and models to identify neural mechanisms and circuits for decision-making. Through this approach, my research aims to uncover the general principles governing cognition.\n\nSaransh Sharma, MIT, will present a talk, “Miniaturized biomedical devices for navigation, sensing and stimulation.”\n\nAbstract: Medical electronic devices are an integral part of the healthcare system today and are used in a variety of applications around us. The design of such devices has several stringent requirements, the key being miniaturization, low power operation, and wireless functionality. In this talk, I will present CMOS-based miniaturized, low-power and wireless biomedical devices in three broad domains: (a) in-vivo navigation and tracking, (b) in-vivo sensing of biomarkers and physiological signals, and (c) in-vivo stimulation and drug delivery. For the first part, I will talk about ingestible and implantable devices that can be used to achieve sub-mm tracking accuracy in 3D and in real time inside the human body, which is very useful for localizing devices in the GI tract, during precision surgeries and minimally invasive procedures. In the second part, I will present the design of a novel on-chip 3D magnetic sensor that is highly miniaturized and low-power, thus making it suitable for many biomedical applications. In the last part, I will briefly talk about my recent work on a wearable device for multi-modal sensing from sweat, followed by ongoing work on devices for stimulation and drug-delivery. I will end the talk with a glimpse of my future research direction.\n\nBio: Saransh Sharma received the B.Tech. degree in Electronics and Electrical Communication Engineering from IIT Kharagpur, India, in 2017 and the M.S. and Ph.D. degree in Electrical Engineering from Caltech, Pasadena, CA, USA, in 2018 and 2023 respectively.

Yet, the precise mechanisms orchestrating experience-dependent modifications of cortical synapses remain incompletely understood. To address this gap, my research focuses on conditioned taste aversion – a robust associative learning paradigm known to alter rodents’ taste perception following adverse experiences. Specifically, I seek to identify the synaptic plasticity mechanism pivotal for regulating the specificity and generalization of associative taste memory.\n\nUsing ex vivo physiology and activity-dependent genetic labeling methods, I uncovered that homeostatic synaptic scaling plays a crucial role in constraining postsynaptic weights in excitatory neurons within the gustatory cortex during memory consolidation. I demonstrated that this homeostatic regulation via\n\nsynaptic scaling is key to ensuring the specificity of associative taste memory. Intriguingly, I found that sensory experiences associated with strongly negative consequences can override synaptic scaling, resulting in pervasive increases in postsynaptic strengths within the cortical network and the generalization of learned taste aversion. Collectively, my work unveiled a novel mechanism whereby\n\nhomeostatic synaptic scaling shapes the specificity of associative taste memory while laying the groundwork for elucidating the synaptic underpinnings of memory overgeneralization in mental disorders such as post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD).\n\nIn an ongoing work, I also established a two-photon in vivo calcium imaging method to longitudinally track taste-evoked activities in cortical neurons. This novel approach will further propel me to delineate how synaptic scaling—and other forms of synaptic plasticity—guides the transition in neuronal representations of taste in the gustatory cortex during taste learning.\n\nIn the future, I plan to elucidate how the interplay between cortical excitatory and inhibitory synaptic\n\nplasticity modifies the functions of taste circuitry and shapes familiar taste perception. I will then examine the mechanism by which cortical inhibitory drives gate the interaction between current and future taste experiences. By leveraging interdisciplinary strategies from cellular and behavioral neuroscience, my\n\nresearch will advance our understanding of how synaptic computation at the cellular level systematically instructs taste coding in the cortex, ultimately providing insight into how such neural adaptability fails in animal models of psychiatric disorders.\n\nPeiyan Dong, Northeastern University, will present a talk, “Towards Ultimate Efficiency in Ubiquitous ML Powered Intelligence and Green AI.”\n\nAbstract: As AI techniques continue to advance, the efficient deployment of deep neural networks on resource-constrained devices becomes increasingly appealing yet challenging. Simultaneously, the proliferation of powerful AI technologies has raised significant concerns about sustainability and fairness, demanding increased attention from the community. This talk presents two novel software-hardware co-designs for improving the efficiency and sustainability of deep learning models. The first part introduces a hardware-efficient adaptive token pruning framework for Vision Transformers (ViTs) on embedded FPGA, HeatViT, which achieves significant speedup under similar model accuracy compared to the state-of-the-art. HeatViT is the first end-to-end accelerator for ViT on embedded FPGA and also achieve practical speedup by data-level compression for the first time. The second presents PackQViT and Agile Quant, a paradigm of the efficient implementation for transformer-based models by sub-8-bit packed quantization and SIMD-based optimization for computing kernels. Our framework can achieve better task performance than state-of-the-art ViTs and LLMs with significant acceleration and power saving on edge processors, such as mobile CPU, Raspberry Pi and RISC V. This work not only marks the first successful implementation of the LLM on the edge but also addresses the previous limitation where edge processors struggled to efficiently handle sub-8-bit computations. At the conclusion of the presentation, the speaker will discuss today’s challenges related to AI sustainability and fairness and outline her research plans aimed at addressing these issues.\n\nBio: Peiyan (Peggie) Dong is a final-year Ph.D. Student at Northeastern University, Boston, advised by Prof. Yanzhi Wang.

Despite this broad success, it is a classically open question whether they can represent and generalize symbolic structure; in which there are entities which are represented as atomic symbols (CAT, MUFFIN), and there are abstract content-independent functions that operate over those symbols (e.g. NOT, AND, OR). In principle, neural networks are universal function approximators and can learn any function, but in practice, learning symbolic structure from data without the use of architecture specific to symbolic structure has proven challenging. However, modern neural models (e.g. large language models) are able to learn extremely powerful representations over the course of their training, which calls into question whether learning representations of symbolic structure is within their capacity.\n\nIn this thesis, we explore the hypothesis that representations of symbolic structure can emerge during training in prototypical neural sequence models. We evaluate LSTM- and Transformer-based neural network models with low inductive biases and without extensive architectural engineering on symbolic tasks borrowed from developmental psychology and cognitive neuroscience. We focus on carefully controlled experimental paradigms and small models in order to yield interpretable results. In the first chapter, we evaluate whether neural network language models can differentiate logical operators in a symbolic reasoning task within a propositional logic setting, and find that models’ performance relies on the degree to which the operators are separable given their distribution in the data. In the second chapter, we evaluate object-tracking models from computational vision at a task from the developmental psychology literature which tests reasoning by exclusion within a visual setting, and find that models do not generalize to the logical inference when it is not explicitly featured in their training data. Finally, within a computational cognitive neuroscience setting, we find that Transformer models trained on a working memory task mimic biological functionality for storing and recalling items within working memory, despite not having an explicit “memory” component themselves. Overall, our results provide insight into the conditions within the training data and architecture of neural models which are necessary for representations of symbolic structure to arise, which can inform evaluation of neural models across the field of artificial intelligence.\n\nHost: Professor Ellie Pavlick\n\nThe Advance RI-CTR Clinical and Translational Research Seminar Series showcases clinical and translational research from across Rhode Island.

Data from a pilot study assessing community need, recommendations, and implementation of a new model of care for people living with PD will be presented. First, qualitative data collected during a series of focus groups with people living with Parkinson’s disease (PwPD) and their care partners (CPs) and individual health provider interviews will be discussed. Second, those recommendations characterizing an efficient and effective model of support that meet the healthcare needs of PwPD were implemented as the EMPOWER PD Clinic pilot study. Data presented will reveal a novel approach to improve the lives of PwPD and their caregivers and supports the clinic as a model that would empower PwPD to more fully participate in decision making and management of their health.\n\nAbout Dr. Clarkin\n\nChristine Clarkin, PT, DPT, PhD received her B.S. degree in Physical Therapy from the University of Vermont in 1987, her DPT from Simmons University in Boston in 2010, and her PhD in Neuroscience from the University of Rhode Island in 2020.

Zuckerman Mind Brain Behavior Institute, Columbia University\n\nThe ability of the visual system to store and use learned information, or perceptual priors, is essential for interpreting complex visual scenes, such as identifying obscured objects or imagining scenes not currently visible. This process relies on the interaction between processing incoming sensory data and existing knowledge stored in the synaptic strengths throughout the brain. Although the importance of top-down and bottom-up integration is recognized, the precise ways in which they enable the brain to piece together information from different sources remain largely unknown.\n\nMy research aims to reveal the mechanisms underlying these processes by demonstrating how the brain’s need to function reliably in noisy environments influences the development of these pathways, enabling visual processing abilities like resolving visual occlusion and visual imagination. The phenomenon of illusory contours and shapes, exemplified by the Kanizsa optical illusion and Rubin’s face-vase illusion, serves as an ideal case study for how the brain combines sensory input with past experiences to create a coherent perception. Previous studies have shown that such illusory contours invoke activation in specific layers (L2/3) of the early visual cortex but not in others (L4). I will demonstrate the recapitulation of these findings within a deep convolutional model optimized for object recognition, powered by a theory-grounded, biologically plausible algorithm that processes activations through forward and feedback pathways iteratively. This represents the first instance of a large-scale, image-computable model that, while primarily optimized for recognizing objects, also explains how illusions are perceived in the visual cortex as a result of integrating sensory data with learned information.\n\nZooming out, the insights from this computational modeling suggest a resolution to the debate over whether the brain functions primarily as a generative or a pattern recognition neural network, and explaining a number of experimental findings regarding specificity of computations in cortical layers.\n\nAbstract: Proper regulation of gene expression is a crucial component of life, yet remains poorly understood despite a recent explosion in the quality and availability of genomic measurements. A paradigm that has emerged involves training neural networks that take in genomic sequences and predict these measurements directly. Far from being uninterpretable, these models can be paired with feature attribution algorithms to discover building blocks of the regulatory code. In this talk, I will introduce our ongoing work on a neural network called DragoNNFruit that extends this paradigm to modern data sets where measurements are available for each of many individual cells. A distinguishing feature of DragoNNFruit is that the parameters of this method are dynamically generated for each cell in the experiment based on properties of the cell, rephrasing the learning task as that of learning how to process genomic sequence in a cell-specific manner. When applied to data from cells that are slowly transitioning across types, DragoNNFruit uncovers the regulatory code of both endpoints but also how this code gets rewritten as cells alter their identity, and even how individual nucleotides can be involved in different regulatory programs in different cell types. Afterwards, I will briefly discuss pitfalls that one can encounter when applying machine learning to genomics data, and introduce my vision for new directions that these machine learning models can take.\n\nBio: Dr. Jacob Schreiber is a postdoctoral scholar in the Department of Genetics at Stanford University, where he develops machine learning-based methods for studying the genome.

While many animals play, human play is distinguished by the sheer diversity of goals that we pursue, even as adults. Yet the seeming inutility of play belies one of the hallmarks of intelligence: a remarkably flexible ability to reason and plan in novel situations. What kind of mind generates and pursues so many goals, and has so much fun in the process? I suggest that answering this question takes us beyond current accounts of rational action and exploration. In this talk, I will present three lines of work on reasoning and decision-making in (mostly) playful contexts. I will begin with a case study of goal-directed reasoning: how children assess speculative conjectures in the absence of any evidence. Then, I will discuss the proposal that play in humans reflects a novel kind of exploration, in which players are trying to figure out what problems they can pose and solve. I will present a number of empirical studies – spanning exploratory play to rule-based games and imaginative pretense – illustrating how children and adults choose goals and actions when trying to have fun, compared with under other objectives. This research suggests that inventing and pursuing novel goals is an intrinsically rewarding activity, and I will speculate on why that might be valuable for human cognition. I will end by briefly discussing ongoing research on goal generation and creativity, in both humans and machines. By paying attention to the goals we adopt and the problems we make for ourselves, I aim to explain the richness and flexibility of the human mind.\n\n“Piecing the Puzzle Together: Building a Bridge to Discovery Using Health Informatics Approaches for Autism Spectrum Disorder”\n\nAdvisor: Dr. Elizabeth Chen\n\nChildren with high-needs, including those with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD), require extensive medical, behavioral, and educational support due to their complex conditions. These challenges necessitate innovative data-driven approaches to inform decision-making and improve care. The Learning Health System (LHS) framework systematically incorporates data-driven insights and evidence-based knowledge into healthcare practice to enhance patient outcomes.\n\nThis dissertation focuses on the knowledge discovery aspect of LHS by using a mixed methods approach, combining qualitative insights and computational findings to inform a tailored healthcare intervention. The three aims are to: (1) Conduct an in-depth qualitative study with caregivers of children with high-needs to examine unmet needs, social challenges, emotional impacts, and essential resources; (2) Use computational methods to study the ASD population and associated comorbidities using statewide clinical data; and, (3) Integrate the qualitative and computational findings to create a comprehensive strategy for a technology-based application that addresses the identified needs. This overall approach not only strengthens the basis for more informed healthcare technologies but also supports the LHS principle of continuous, evidence-based improvement.\n\nThe findings highlight the need for enhanced mental health support and personalized care plans, specifically focusing on the increased risk of suicidal thoughts and behaviors in individuals with ASD. The combined research findings further inform a concept and wireframe prototype for a digital safety plan application that addresses mental health safety and provides customized resources, aiming to improve access to necessary services for high-needs children and ASD. By integrating diverse research outputs, design and functionality of targeted technological solutions can be improved, leading to more effective and personalized health interventions.\n\nThe components of this dissertation introduce a nested framework within the larger LHS paradigm for knowledge discovery in healthcare, emphasizing the bridge of qualitative insights and computational findings. The proposed Bridge to Discovery in Learning Health Systems (BD- LHS) framework showcases an integrated approach, leveraging the combination of stakeholder insights and computational data analysis to drive evidence-based interventions. This holistic approach aims to generate a responsive, adaptive healthcare system that meets community needs and sets a new standard for interdisciplinary collaboration in health informatics, fostering continuous improvement in health outcomes.\n\nBuilding Performant and Brain-Like Recurrent Models from Neurons and Astrocytes\n\nLeo Kozachkov, Ph.D., Postdoctoral Associate, McGovern Institute for Brain Research, MIT\n\nThe brain’s ability to perform challenging tasks is facilitated by its many inductive biases—hardwired biological features that predispose it to process information in certain ways over others. These features include anatomically distinct brain areas, as well as specialized cell types such as neurons and glia. Inductive biases grant the brain computational powers that currently surpass artificial intelligence systems in many domains. In this seminar, I will cover two recent avenues of research that leverage the brain’s inductive biases to build highly performant, recurrent artificial networks.\n\nIn the first half of my talk, I will discuss recent progress in understanding the computational role of different cell types. I will focus on neuron-glial interactions. An intriguing fact is that most human brain cells are not neurons, but rather glia. There is mounting experimental evidence suggesting that astrocytes, a specialized type of glial cell, play a significant role in learning, memory, and behavior. However, our theoretical understanding is lagging far behind. I will cover recent work that aims to bridge this gap by relating dynamical, energy-based neuron-astrocyte networks to powerful AI models such as Modern Hopfield Networks and transformers.\n\nIn the second half of my talk, I will discuss how and why the brain maintains a balance between flexibility and stability through “dynamic attractors”, which are reproducible patterns of neural activity in response to (potentially time-varying) stimuli. This work reveals an unexpected and useful theoretical link between dynamic attractors and modularity. Specifically, recurrent neural networks with dynamic attractors can be combined into large, modular “networks of networks”, reminiscent of the brain’s macroscopic organization, in ways that provably preserve stability. These higher-order, stable networks can then be optimized for state-of-the-art performance on benchmark sequential processing tasks, demonstrating that dynamic stability is a useful inductive bias for building brain-like performant recurrent models.\n\nThe Advance RI-CTR Clinical and Translational Research Seminar Series showcases clinical and translational research from across Rhode Island.

Be it a simple computation or a complex behavior, all biological functions involve many individual units. A theory of function must specify how to bridge different levels of description at different scales. For example, to predict the weather, it is irrelevant to follow the velocities of every molecule of air. Instead, we use coarser quantities of aggregated motion of many molecules, e.g., pressure fields. Statistical physics provides us with a theoretical framework to specify principled methods to systematically ‘move’ between descriptions of microscale quantities (air molecules) to macroscale ones (pressure fields). Can we hypothesize equivalent frameworks in the nervous system? How can we use descriptions at the level of neurons and synapses to make precise predictions of activity and behavior? My research group will develop theory, modeling, and machine learning tools to discover generalizable forms of scale bridging across species and behavioral functions. In this talk, I will present lines of previous, ongoing, and proposed research that highlight the potential of this vision. I shall focus on two seemingly very different systems: mouse brain neural activity patterns, and octopus skin cells activity patterns. In the mouse, we reveal striking scaling behavior and hallmarks of a renormalization group- like fixed point governing the system. In the octopus, camouflage skin pattern activity is reliably confined to a (quasi-) defined dynamical space. Finally, I will touch upon the benefits of comparing across animals to extract principles of multiscale function in the nervous system, and propose future directions to investigate how macroscale properties, such as memory or camouflage, emerge from microscale level activity of individual cells.\n\nJonathan Viventi, Associate Professor in Duke University’s Department of Biomedical Engineering, will present a talk entitled, “Flexibile electronics for neural interfaces.”\n\nRight now, all of the tools that interface with our brains face a fundamental trade-off. We can either sample with low resolution, over large areas of the brain, or we can sample with fine resolution, over very small areas of the brain. This doesn’t fit with the way our brains are structured. With over 12 million neurons in each square cm of brain surface, we need to sample with high resolution over large areas in order to understand the way the brain works. The limitation is wiring. Every contact we put in the brain requires an individual wire and we can’t fit more than about 100 wires inside our heads. Using the same electronics that enable a digital camera to have millions of pixels without millions of wires, we can move some of the signal processing right to the sensors, allowing us to overcome the wiring bottleneck. The challenge is that traditional electronics are rigid and brittle. They are not compatible with the soft, curved surfaces of the brain. The solution is to make electronics that are flexible. Think of a piece of 2x4 lumber and a sheet of paper, they’re both made out of the same material, but have dramatically different physical properties. Leveraging that idea, we can make electronics that are extremely flexible, by making them very thin. Using these flexible electronics, we have developed high-density electrode arrays with thousands of electrodes that do not require thousands of external wires.\n\nThis technology has enabled extremely flexible arrays of 1,024 electrodes and soon, thousands of multiplexed and amplified sensors spaced as closely as 25 µm apart, which are connected using just a few wires. These devices yield an unprecedented level of spatial and temporal micro-electrocorticographic (µECoG) resolution for recording and stimulating distributed neural networks. I will present the development of this technology and data from in vivo recordings. I will also discuss how we are translating this technology for human clinical use.\n\nThe Advance RI-CTR Clinical and Translational Research Seminar Series showcases clinical and translational research from across Rhode Island.

Women with racial and ethnic minority identities, specifically Hispanic and Black women exhibit suboptimal physical activity-related behaviors and are disproportionately burdened by obesity and physical-activity related chronic diseases. Mothers often report too many responsibilities and prioritizing their children’s needs and extracurricular activities as barriers to engaging in more physical activity. Drs. Tayla von Ash and Bess Marcus designed an intervention to promote physical activity among mothers in a community setting they regularly spend time for their children’s extracurricular activities, circumventing this barrier. Moms on the Move is the first physical activity intervention delivered to mothers during their children’s sports practices, and additionally circumvents transportation and childcare barriers, which are also commonly cited, especially by low-income and racial and ethnic minority mothers. During this talk, Dr. von Ash will provide an overview of the intervention and present preliminary findings regarding feasibility, acceptability, and efficacy\n\nAbout Dr. von Ash\n\nTayla von Ash is an Assistant Professor of Behavioral and Social Sciences and Center for Health Promotion and Health Equity at the Brown University School of Public Health. She initially joined Brown as Presidential Postdoctoral Fellow in 2018 after having received her ScD in social behavioral sciences and public health nutrition from Harvard University. She did her MPH training at Yale University and undergraduate training at UCLA. Dr. von Ash’s research focuses on obesity prevention in racial and ethnic minority and low income families. Most of her research has focused on parenting behaviors and child health outcomes, but her recent work, which she will present on today, additionally targets parents own health behaviors. Dr. von Ash utilizes both qualitative and quantitative data to better understand the contextual factors that contribute to health disparities and design innovative intervention approaches to address them.\n\nThursday, February 8, 2024 (12:30 - 1:00 PM)\n\nLouisa Thompson, PhD: “Digital Approaches to Detecting Cognitive Decline Among Older Adults in Primary Care Settings”\n\nGrowing rates of Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and greater awareness of its symptoms should translate into earlier diagnosis. However, there is a shortage of specialists with expertise in dementia diagnosis and care, and also a shortage of efficient and accurate tools to assist with screening in general medical settings. Novel methods of assessing AD risk and detecting preclinical disease are in development and are beginning to be used in prevention-focused clinical drug trials. These methods also have the potential to inform screening for cognitive decline and other early markers of AD in clinical practice. Some of these methods include digital tools for detecting subtle cognitive decline, quantification of AD biomarkers in the blood and retina, and AD risk genotyping. This talk will focus on describing some of the latest research on these new approaches to early detection and discuss what next steps are needed to move them toward clinical implementation.\n\nAbout Dr. Thompson\n\nLouisa Thompson, Ph.D., is an Assistant Professor in the Department of Psychiatry and Human Behavior at the Warren Alpert Medical School of Brown University and a Neuropsychologist in the Memory and Aging Program at Butler Hospital in Providence, Rhode Island. Her research aims to use smartphone apps and other novel digital tools to improve cognitive screening methods for use in older adult populations. In particular, she seeks to validate and implement digital assessment approaches that are feasible for use in primary care settings and are sensitive to the subtle cognitive and neuropathological changes associated with ADRD. Dr. Thompson’s research is funded by grants from the Alzheimer’s Association, National Institute on Aging, and Advance-CTR (IDeA-CTR/NIGMS) pilot funds. Additionally, she serves as a co-investigator on several NIH-funded studies investigating other cost-effective and minimally-invasive methods for the early detection of ADRD, including the use of retinal imaging and plasma biomarkers. Dr. Thompson’s long-term research objective is to inform changes in clinical care that will lead to earlier ADRD diagnosis and ultimately better health outcomes for patients living with dementia.\n\nHow does the generative AI revolution remind us that medicine, at its core, is a knowledge processing discipline?\n\nPresented by Isaac Kohane, MD, PhD\n\nA reception will immediately follow the lecture.

Goodman ’74 Memorial Seminar Series\n\nCo-sponsored by the Center for Computational Brain Science\n\nPerception & Action Seminar\n\nSpeaker: Wilson S Geisler III, University of Texas at Austin\n\nTitle: Visual Search in Natural and Other Complex Backgrounds\n\nAbstract: Visually searching for specific objects is a fundamental task that humans and other animals are performing almost continuously. Over the past 5-6 years we have been measuring and modeling the factors that determine human search performance in natural and other complex backgrounds. Our goal is to develop a general theory that can quantitatively predict visual search performance and guide studies of the underlying neural circuitry. We are taking a systematic three step approach. The first step is to measure and model the scene and sensory factors that determine the identifiability of specific targets at known locations across the visual field, in arbitrary scenes. The second step is to measure and model covert search where the specific target can appear at random locations within the visual scene with some prior probability distribution, and the observer’s task is to report the location of the target or that it is absent. In the covert search task, the stimulus is presented for the duration of a typical fixation during overt search. The third step is to measure and model overt search, which can be regarded as a sequence of covert searches where information is extracted and combined over the series of fixation locations selected by the observer. To obtain principled biologically plausible hypotheses for the decision processes in covert and overt search we have been using “Bayesian Heuristic Decision Analysis”, where we derive the Bayesian ideal searcher and use it as the benchmark for systematically evaluating heuristic decision processes. This talk will summarize our progress in this three-step approach, including a number of rather surprising discoveries.\n\nMichael S. Goodman ’74 Memorial Seminar Series\n\nThe Developmental Brown Bag (DBB) is a speaker series dedicated to investigating developmental origins, trajectories and mechanisms. Speakers consider development from a cognitive, social, and cultural perspective.\n\nSpeaker: Brian Leahy, Brown University\n\nTitle: Evidence that children appreciate possibilities emerges in parallel in language and behavior\n\nAbstract: When we speak, words like ‘maybe’ and ‘might’ can be used to mark a sentence as merely possible, as one member of a range of competing alternatives for a single reality. These words allow us to coherently describe incompatible possibilities in a single, coherent sentence. It’s incoherent to say that Jim is in Paris and Jim in Rome, but there’s nothing incoherent about saying that Jim might be in Paris and might be in Rome. Cognition has elements that perform this function as well, flagging propositions as merely possible, enabling us to store information about multiple incompatible possibilities in a coherent model that supports effective action. I call any element that has this function a “possibility concept”. How do possibility concepts support reasoning and decision-making, and how do they develop? In this talk I will show curious lapses in preschoolers’ decision-making when they are faced with multiple incompatible possibilities. These lapses indicate that they are not deploying possibility concepts. Then I will show that these lapses are related to language comprehension. Many children have mastered parts of the English modal auxiliary system by 36 months of age. But mastering the full system takes much longer; many 4-year-olds still have not mastered the full system. But those 4-year-olds who have mastered the full system do not show these curious\n\nlapses in their decision-making. Four-year-olds who have not yet mastered the auxiliary system show the same curious lapses as much younger children. These data prompt a challenging question: does learning to talk about possibilities play a role in the development of concepts for thinking about possibilities?\n\nMichael S. Goodman ’74 Memorial Seminar Series\n\nPerception & Action Seminar\n\nSpeaker: Daniel Dilks, Emory University\n\nTitle: Three scene systems: neural, causal, and developmental evidence\n\nAbstract: The human ability to recognize a place (or “scene”) forms the bedrock for many of our essential everyday behaviors. In a brief glance, we extract a wealth of information from scenes, such as the category of the scene (e.g., a kitchen), and other critical properties such as what behavior is appropriate for the current context (e.g., cooking). At the same time, we extract information that is vital for navigation, allowing us to effortlessly find our way through the local environment without running into the kitchen walls or banging into the kitchen table, for example. What’s more, we can situate the local environment within a broader spatial map, allowing us, for instance, to know where our favorite restaurant is relative to our house. But how do we accomplish these remarkable feats? One promising strategy for attempting to understand human visual scene processing is to characterize the neural systems that accomplish it. Cognitive neuroscience of the past three decades has revealed a set of three cortical regions that together make up the human visual scene processing system: the parahippocampal place area (PPA), the occipital place area (OPA), and the retrosplenial complex (RSC). However, beyond establishing the general involvement of these regions in scene processing (i.e., responding more to images of scenes than to images of everyday objects or faces in human neuroimaging experiments), a fundamental and yet unanswered question remains: What precise role does each region play within the broad domain of human visual scene processing? In this talk, I will provide converging neural, causal, and developmental evidence that human visual scene processing is composed of three distinct systems: one we call the “scene categorization” system (including PPA), which is involved in recognizing a scene as a kind of place (e.g., a kitchen); another we call the “visually-guided navigation” (including OPA), which is involved in finding our way through the local environment, avoiding boundaries and obstacles; and a third we call the “map-based navigation” system (including RSC), which is involved in making our way from a specific place to some distant, out-of-sight place.\n\nMichael S. Goodman ’74 Memorial Seminar Series\n\nThe Developmental Brown Bag (DBB) is a speaker series dedicated to investigating developmental origins, trajectories and mechanisms. Speakers consider development from a cognitive, social, and cultural perspective.\n\nSpeaker: Jennifer Gómez, Boston University\n\nTitle: Cultural Betrayal, Sexual Abuse, & Healing: Implications for the Family\n\nAbstract: The impact of child sexual abuse (CSA) on adult survivors is affected by the interpersonal and societal contexts in which the abuse occurs. According to betrayal trauma theory (Freyd, 1996), CSA perpetrated by someone close, like a parent, is classified as a high betrayal trauma because the abuse violates the child’s trust and/or dependence on the parent. Such high betrayal traumas are associated with costly mental, physical, and behavioral health outcomes (e.g., Adams-Clark et al., 2020). Moreover, family betrayal, such as family members’ unsupportive responses to a child’s CSA victimization, is further linked with dissociation and PTSD (Delker et al., 2018). In addition to this interpersonal context, structural racism (Mills, 1997) and intersectional oppression (e.g., interlocking racism and sexism; Collins, 1991) further impact Black female survivors. Specifically, cultural betrayal trauma theory (Gómez, 2012, 2023) proposes that if a Black father sexually abuses his Black daughter, the girl’s outcomes are impacted by both people experiencing discrimination in society. Specifically, because of structural racism, within-group violence–Black perpetrator, Black victim–includes a cultural betrayal harm because it violates the solidarity, or (intra)cultural trust, developed within the Black community that protects against the racism. Cultural betrayal trauma is associated with a range of outcomes, including dissociation, PTSD, and internalized prejudice (Gómez, 2023). Taken together, CSA that occurs within a Black family can include high betrayal (Freyd, 1996), family betrayal (Delker et al., 2018), and cultural betrayal (Gómez, 2023). Despite often being the site of intimate terrorism via male-perpetrated CSA and other violence in the home (United Nations General Assembly, 1993), the family unit can alternatively provide a haven for healing. In this talk, Dr. Gómez will review the literature on betrayal trauma theory (Freyd, 1996), family betrayal (Delker et al., 2018), structural racism (Buggs et al., 2020), intersectional oppression (Crenshaw, 1991), sexual violence (Gómez & Johnson, 2022), and cultural betrayal trauma theory (Gómez, 2023). She then will detail the strengths found in many Black families, including extended networks of support from elders, parents, siblings, children, other relatives, loved ones, and friends (McAdoo & Younge, 2009), who provide connection, cultural identity, safety, protection, and solidarity against oppression (e.g., hooks, 1984; Zinzow et al., 2021). Taken her from book, The Cultural Betrayal of Black Women & Girls: A Black Feminist Approach to Healing from Sexual Abuse (Gómez, 2023; American Psychological Association), she will then discuss avenues for Black women’s healing from CSA both within and outside of the family. Lastly, Dr. Gómez will close with hope for creating a world in which violence and inequality no longer exist.\n\nBME Seminar with Jiayi Joanna Zhang (Fudan University, Shanghai)\n\nTitle: Titanium nanowire arrays as artificial photoreceptors: from non-human primates to first-in-human clinical trials\n\nAbstract: Retinal prostheses could restore image-forming vision in conditions of photoreceptor degeneration. However, contrast sensitivity and visual acuity are often insufficient. In this talk, we will report the performance, in mice and monkeys with induced photoreceptor degeneration, of subretinally implanted gold-nanoparticle-coated titania nanowire arrays providing a spatial resolution of 77.5 μm and a temporal resolution of 3.92 Hz in ex vivo retinas (as determined by patch-clamp recording of retinal ganglion cells). In blind mice, the arrays allowed for the detection of drifting gratings and flashing objects at light-intensity thresholds of 15.70–18.09 μW mm–2, and offered visual acuities of 0.3–0.4 cycles per degree, as determined by recordings of visually evoked potentials and optomotor-response tests. In monkeys, the arrays were stable for 54 weeks, allowed for the detection of a 10 μW mm–2 beam of light (0.5o in beam angle) in visually guided saccade\n\nexperiments, and induced plastic changes in the primary visual cortex, as indicated by long-term in vivo calcium imaging. We also demonstrated that nanomaterials as artificial photoreceptors ameliorate visual deficits in patients with photoreceptor degeneration.\n\nBio: Dr. Jiayi Zhang received her B. Sc. Degree from Hong Kong Baptist University and Ph.D. degree from Brown University.

Goodman ’74 Memorial Seminar Series\n\nSocial Cognitive Science Seminar\n\nLocation: Dome Room, Metcalf 305 and via Zoom, https://brown.zoom.us/j/95166664847\n\nFirst Year Talks\n\nSpeaker: Laila Johnston\n\nTitle: Reasoning with Compositional Concepts in the Probabilistic Language of Thought\n\nAbstract: Humans organize the world using concepts: we say that people run, and we generate and understand novel concepts, like running unicorns. How do we understand the meaning of these concepts? Past theories usually approached the study of concepts in one of two ways. Symbolic approaches directly specify conceptual meaning; running is an action with a defined, discrete set of properties. Symbols naturally compose to form complex novel concepts, but don’t allow for uncertainty in learning, representation, and reasoning. Statistical approaches learn from data and represent concepts probabilistically. These allow for uncertainty but lack the formal compositionality key to symbolic approaches; new concepts must be learned from scratch. Here we investigate the probabilistic language of thought hypothesis (PLoT), which expresses the compositional and probabilistic nature of concepts in a unified computational framework. We evaluate PLoT in an intuitive “tug-of-war” tournament scenario in which uncertainty and compositionality play key roles. For example, winner is defined as the team that most strongly pulls the rope, where team, pulling, and strength are also concepts in the model. PLoT model predictions closely track human judgements and compare favorably with alternative models, including large language models, demonstrating the viability of PLoT as a framework for how humans learn, represent, and reason with concepts.\n\nSpeaker: Ziwei Cheng\n\nTitle: Reward Processing in Depression: Insights from Complementary Computational Analyses\n\nAbstract: Depression is a prevalent and disabling psychiatric condition that commonly emerges in adolescence and young adulthood and is associated with reward processing abnormalities. However, findings are mixed regarding the specific dimensions of reward processing that are altered in depression. In 726 adolescents and young adults varying in depressive symptoms and diagnoses, this study evaluated depression-related abnormalities in reward processing using the Probabilistic Reward Task (PRT) and complementary computational models. Analyses showed that both reinforcement learning and drift diffusion models explained reward-seeking behavior. Individuals with depressive disorders showed lower response bias compared to youth with no history of psychopathology, and higher levels of anhedonia were associated with slower evidence accumulation during decision-making. Parameters varied in reliability, and depression-related effects showed fair to adequate replication in cross-fold validation. Complementary modeling approaches provide insight into reward processes in depression, but results underscore the importance of evaluating parameter psychometrics and replicability of clinical effects.\n\nMichael S. Goodman ’74 Memorial Seminar Series\n\nSocial Cognitive Science Seminar\n\nSpeaker: Jason Leng, Shenhav Lab\n\nTitle: Mutual inclusivity improves decision-making by smoothing out choice’s competitive edge\n\nAbstract: Decision-making forms a central bottleneck to most of our tasks, one that people often experience as costly. To mitigate these costs, previous work has proposed adjusting one’s threshold for deciding (e.g., satisficing) to avoid over-deliberating. Here, we test an alternative solution to these costs, one that targets the basis for most choice costs: the fact that choosing one option sacrifices others (mutual exclusivity). Across 4 studies (N = 385), we test whether this tension can be relieved by framing choices as inclusive (allowing more than one option from a set, similar to a buffet), and whether doing so improves decision-making and the experience thereof. We find that inclusivity makes choices more efficient, because of its unique impact on the level of competition between potential responses as participants accumulate information for each of their options (resulting in a more “race”-like decision process). We find that inclusivity also reduces the subjective costs associated with choice, making people feel less conflicted in conditions where it was hard to choose which good option to acquire or which bad option to get rid of. These inclusivity benefits were distinct from those achieved when trying to merely reduce deliberation (e.g., tightening one’s deadline), which we show can in some cases lead to similar increases in efficiency but only carry the potential to diminish not improve the experience of choosing. This work collectively provides key mechanistic insights into the conditions under which decision making is most costly, and a novel approach aimed at mitigating those costs.\n\nJoin us on Monday, October 23th, for a BNC workshop where we will provide a comprehensive overview of the XNAT neuroimaging data platform, in addition to showcasing the latest features in our data processing tools.

In order to do so, sensory neurons must tune their detection and transduction mechanisms to match environmental states. Drosophila photoreceptors are polarized sensory neurons in which the apical plasma membrane is expanded and specialised to optimize photon absorption leading to sensory transduction. Signal transduction is underpinned by G-protein coupled phospholipase C activation leading to the rapid hydrolysis of phosphatidylinositol 4,5 bisphosphate (PIP2) and ending with the activation of calcium permeable TRP channels. Following PIP hydrolysis, this lipid is resynthesized by a series of biochemical reactions that are distributed both on the apical plasma membrane as well as membranes in the photoreceptor cell body. The mechanism by which these two sets of reactions in physically distinct sub-cellular locations are coupled remains unresolved. Photoreceptors contain membrane contact sites (MCS), regions of close proximity between the plasma membrane and the endoplasmic reticulum. I will describe our work, using genetic and physiological studies in Drosophila, on the structural organisation of these MCS, the function of several proteins localised to these and how MCS organisation is tuned to ongoing photoreceptor function in this specialised cell type.\n\nA reception with light refreshments will follow.\n\nMichael S. Goodman ’74 Memorial Seminar Series\n\nThe Perception & Action Seminar Series explores a wide range of research in the domain of human perception and controlling action.\n\nSpeaker: Peter Neri, École Normale Supérieure (virtual)\n\nTitle: The unreasonable recalcitrance of human vision to theoretical domestication\n\nAbstract: We can view cortex from two fundamentally different perspectives: a powerful device for performing optimal inference, or an assembly of biological components not built for achieving statistical optimality. The former approach is attractive thanks to its elegance and potentially wide applicability, however the basic facts of human pattern vision do not support it. Instead, they indicate that the idiosyncratic behaviour produced by visual cortex is largely dictated by its hardware components. The output of these components can be steered towards optimality by our cognitive apparatus, but only to a marginal extent. We conclude that current theories of visually-guided behaviour are at best inadequate, and we turn to neural networks in an attempt to establish whether the idiosyncratic character of human vision may be learnt from a larger repertoire of functional constraints, such as the statistics of the natural environment. We challenge deep convolutional networks with the same stimuli/tasks used with human observers and apply equivalent characterization of the stimulus–response coupling. For shallow depth of behavioural characterization, some variants of network-architecture/training-protocol produce human-like trends; however, more articulate empirical descriptors expose glaring discrepancies. Our results urge caution in assessing whether neural networks do or do not capture human behavior: ultimately, our ability to assess ‘‘success’’ in this area can only be as good as afforded by the depth of behavioral characterization against which the network is evaluated. More generally, our results provide a compelling demonstration of how far we still are from securing an adequate computational account of even the most basic operations carried out by human vision.\n\nMichael S. Goodman ’74 Memorial Seminar Series\n\nThe Developmental Brown Bag (DBB) is a speaker series dedicated to investigating developmental origins, trajectories and mechanisms. Speakers consider development from a cognitive, social, and cultural perspective.\n\nSpeaker: Ashley Thomas, Harvard University\n\nTitle: Intuitive Theory of Social Relationships\n\nAbstract:\n\nEvery day, we recognize social relationships and use knowledge about social relationships to inform our behavior. For example, we recognize that it is acceptable to eat off our spouse’s plate, but unacceptable to eat off our employer’s plate. We may laugh at our boss’s joke to maintain our deferential relationship or do a favor for a coworker to maintain a cooperative one. Previous research on social cognitive development has largely focused on infants’ and children’s social reasoning either at the microscale of an individual person’s actions, thoughts, and beliefs (e.g., ‘theory of mind’), or at the macroscale, of societal groups and social categories (e.g., ingroups and outgroups, gender, or race). My research program is situated between these scales, focusing on how humans think about relationships between individuals which we depend on for our survival and wellbeing. In this talk I will consider findings from developmental psychology and propose that throughout our lives, our representations of social relationships are intuitive theories. I propose three central components of this intuitive theory: evaluating whether a relationship exists; categorizing it into a model (i.e., type, schema, concept) and computing its strength (i.e., intensity, pull, or thickness). Following Relational Models Theory (Fiske, 1991, 2004), I propose that from infancy, humans recognize relationships that belong to three models: communal sharing (where people see themselves as one), authority ranking (where people see themselves as ranked), and equality matching (where people see themselves as separate and track reciprocity). A single relationship can be organized according to any of these models depending on the context, but relationships tend to use a dominant model. The other component is a relationship’s strength and can be thought of as a continuous representation of obligations (the extent to which certain actions are expected and morally evaluated), and commitment (the likelihood that people will continue the relationship). In communal sharing relationships this may be felt as attachment, in authority ranking relationships it may be felt as allegiance or loyalty, and in equality matching relationships it may be felt as trust. One hypothesis regarding strength is that the stronger a connection, the less interchangeable the person or people. These representations, and the assumption that others share them, allow us to form, maintain and change social relationships by informing how we interpret and evaluate the actions of others and plan our own.\n\nThe Carney Center for Computational Brain Science and the Brainstorm Program is organizing a two-week computational modeling workshop with a focus on computational modeling of cognition, behavior, and brain/behavior relationships. Workshop attendees will learn the basic tools for understanding, developing, and applying models to brain science questions, and have the opportunity to apply these techniques in a novel dataset.\n\nWeek 1 will consist of workshops and live tutorials, including daily lectures spanning basic to advanced topics, accompanied by hands-on coding tutorials. Attendees will learn the basic tools for understanding, developing and applying computational models, with a focus on hypothesis testing, quantitative fitting, bayesian methods, and model checks and comparisons. Additionally, advanced modeling sessions will provide a deeper theoretical understanding and application of complex modeling techniques.\n\nDuring Week 2, participants will have the opportunity to work in teams to apply these skills to analyze a real dataset provided by the organizers, with potential for novel discoveries. Prizes will be awarded for models with the most predictive power, rigor, creativity, and innovation.\n\nFor details on last years’ workshops and modeling competition, visit the Center for Computational Brain Science website. Previous syllabi are available here. We will cover most of the same basic topics, with a few tweaks and additions (based on participant input and guest speakers).\n\nIntended Audience: This workshop is open to the members of the Brown community, and is designed for researchers across fields, backgrounds and levels of experience: computation “novices” with no experience and those with more computational experience who may want to augment their toolkit with advanced approaches to parameter estimation or specific classes of models. Although there is no computational experience required, those with modeling backgrounds will still benefit from the advanced modules, and will have the opportunity to learn new skills and state-of-the-art computational approaches.\n\nMaximum number of participants: Participation is limited to 20, but we do keep a waitlist.\n\nRegister here.\n\nOrganizers: Andra Geana, Debbie Yee, Alana Jaskir, Michael Frank\n\nBarun Dutta, Chief Scientist at IMEC and key developer of the Neuropixels platform for high-channel interfaces to the brain, will discuss the design and challenges related to the Neuropixels, latest developments, and future opportunities for single neuron level electronic medicine.\n\nAbstract: Recent advances in CMOS integrated MEMS, has enabled and increased routine extracellular electrophysiology recording capability and capacity from dozens to thousands of neurons in animal models. Applying “a scaling platform approach”, the Neuropixels platforms, will enable next generation of systems to record from and visualize activity of 10’s to 100’s of thousand neurons. I will review our work to develop very high channel count electrophysiology device systems: “the Neuropixels probe”, and the prospects for another 10-50X capacity increase, and address progress towards “recording form the whole brain”.\n\nIn addition, to the technology, I will illustrate a few transformational neuroscience experiments that this technology is enabling, and its power to co-integrate different modalities. I will also discuss some of the challenges the Neuropixels data volume has created, with bottlenecks in analysis, using frequently used techniques, aspiring to produce single neuron activity records, called spike sorting. I will compare different algorithms, show their frequent alarmingly divergent results, and discuss what fraction of this new data volume seems reliable. I will discuss initial work and the potential for single neuron based neuro-electronic medicine.\n\nAn advanced technology platform to impact and accelerate an inter-disciplinary science team of semiconductor engineers, neurotechnologists, neuroscientists, and clinicians will require the power of a global eco-system. I will close by opening a discussion of the needs and limits of electrophysiology recording, asking how many neurons are enough number of neurons?\n\nBiography: Barun Dutta has been the Chief Scientist of IMEC since 2010, leading multiple R&D programs in Silicon Technology Systems, with an emphasis on wafer scale manufacturable patterning and process integration of novel materials and device technologies.

Although the grammaticalization of like has been happening for quite a long time, like has not been systematically analyzed in terms of its demonstrational function, which allows it to selectively depict the speech event in terms of its delivery, intonation, or whichever aspect the speaker may choose to demonstrate. In this research, I investigate how demonstrational like interacts with different kinds of predicates and examine the readings that arise from it. It was found that demonstrational like licenses two kinds of readings: i) content reading whereby the reading focuses on what is being delivered via quote and such that the form of the quoted material is something similar to the original utterance ii) manner reading whereby the demonstrational like phrase modifies the manner of the action performed by the agent. Based on this, this research provides the semantics of the manner reading, the content reading, cases where both readings are licenced, and the underspecified case of be like. With the analysis based on the content-bearing criterion (Moltmann, 2013, 2019) and the analogy between the manner adverbs and demonstrational like phrases, I argue that like phrases work as manner modifiers in principle and that, depending on whether the predicate allows for a null content, the content reading is licensed.\n\nMichael S. Goodman ’74 Memorial Seminar Series.\n\nSpeaker: Ilona Bass, PhD - Postdoctoral Research Fellow- Harvard University\n\nTitle: Reasoning about the Beliefs of Teachers\n\nAbstract : The ability to teach and be taught by others is a cornerstone of human intelligence. Formal frameworks of pedagogy help explain how teachers can best select evidence for others, and why learners can draw richer inferences from pedagogically demonstrated data. These models rest on an implicit assumption that teachers have an accurate representation both of the subject matter being taught and of the learner’s beliefs. But in real-world social learning scenarios, there are many reasons that these assumptions won’t always hold true: As teachers, we may not be able to tell learners every single thing they need to know; we may not be fully aware of each individual learner’s ability level, making it unclear what we should teach next; we may not be able to fully attend to every learner and give canned responses as a result. Are children able to perceive these subtle breakdowns in teaching and adapt their inferences and learning accordingly? I will present results from three converging lines of work suggesting that they can. As early as the preschool years, children (1) detect and evaluate teaching that is under-informative in very subtle ways, (2) calibrate decisions about challenge-seeking to teachers’ false beliefs about their competence, and (3) expect teachers to engage thoughtfully with learners in the moment, as opposed to relying on rote, automatic reasoning processes. For each set of studies, I will present empirical results from both adults and children (age 4-10), and I will also review some of the formal models that underpin our predictions. I will close by thinking about future empirical and theoretical directions, particularly for the third line of studies, which is ongoing work I’m currently conducting in my postdoc.\n\nJoin us on Monday, April 24th, for a BNC workshop where we will provide a comprehensive overview of the XNAT neuroimaging data platform, in addition to showcasing the latest features in our data processing tools.

But as our metaphors for consciousness grow increasingly technological — as we come to see our brains as hardware, and our minds as software — these interior worlds have come to seem less reliable, premised as they are on what the philosopher Daniel Dennett has called the myth of ‘privileged access.’ Our conception of our inner lives is also changing due to current debates about consciousness and the emergence of advanced technologies. At a moment when algorithms are learning to write sonnets and online political discourse has been infiltrated by bots, the ability to believe in the interior lives of others (and of ourselves) is becoming more fraught and requires, at times, a leap of faith.”\n\nMeghan O’Gieblyn is the author of God, Human, Animal, Machine: Technology, Metaphor, and the Search for Meaning (Doubleday, 2021) and Interior States (Anchor, 2018), which won the 2018 Believer Book Award for nonfiction. Her essays have appeared in The New Yorker, Harper’s Magazine, Wired, The Guardian, The New York Times, Bookforum, n+1, The Believer, The Paris Review, and elsewhere. She is the recipient of three Pushcart Prizes and her work has been anthologized in The Best American Essays 2017 (Mariner) and The Contemporary American Essay (Anchor, 2021). She also writes the “Cloud Support” advice column for Wired.\n\nThis event was a part of the Greg and Julie Flynn Cogut Institute Speaker Series, which brings high-profile speakers in the humanities to the Brown University campus. Each visit includes a public lecture and a separate seminar-style meeting with undergraduate students. Brown University undergraduate students and faculty members can nominate future speakers.\n\nPain is protective and necessary for quality of life. Chronic pain is different. It persists well beyond an injury or illness. It may last a lifetime and be resistant to over the counter medications. It’s among the most common conditions in the United States and is one of the most prevailing reasons adults in the U.S. seek medical care. A February 2022 article in the journal Pain found that at least 50 million adults (one in five people) reported pain on most days or every day, with the most common pain locations in the back, hip, knee and foot.\n\nAll this pain has implications for almost every aspect of daily life. A decade ago, researchers estimated that, in the U.S. alone, the annual economic costs attributable to pain — in the form of health care costs and lower worker productivity — ranged from $560 to $635 billion. This is greater than the costs of heart disease, cancer and diabetes combined. Overprescription by unscrupulous pain clinicians has also fueled an opioid epidemic that continues to take a heavy toll on American communities, with more than 80,000 opioid-related deaths reported in 2021.\n\nIn this Carney Conversation, we’ll dig into the neuroscience behind pain, look at some of the new treatments and tools being put into practice to assist those who are suffering, and a novel way that some scientists are rethinking our understanding of pain as a form of “learned behavior” that the brain may be able to unlearn.\n\nGuest Panelists:\n\nZiya L.

Adeno-associated viruses (AAVs) have been of particular interest as a gene delivery vehicle (vector) due to their low toxicity and high engineering potential, although their low efficiency and selectivity have required invasive surgical procedures and transgenic animals. To fulfill the pressing need for toolkits for efficient and precisely targeted non-invasive gene delivery, we have developed high-throughput engineering and screening approaches for advancing recombinant AAV vectors. Initially, we developed a high-throughput selection platform based on directed evolution, named Cre recombinase-based AAV targeted evolution (CREATE), that allows us to effectively narrow down a vast library of capsid variants to dozens of promising candidates over a couple of iterations. With this method, we identified several capsid variants that can deliver genes broadly and efficiently to the central and peripheral nervous systems of mice and non-human primates through systemic administration. Next, to further characterize the tropism of AAV vectors, we developed an ultrasensitive sequential fluorescence in situ hybridization (USeqFISH) method for the spatial transcriptomic profiling of both AAV and endogenous transcripts in intact brain tissue. This method achieves exceptional sensitivity that only requires the unique sequence of 14-nucleotide (nt) in cultured cells and 40-nt in tissue for selective RNA visualization, allowing short barcoding of AAV genomes. With an RNA-retaining tissue clearing and a two-step signal quenching method, we established USeqFISH available for quantitative detection of endogenous and virally delivered genes (up to ~50) via sequential labeling in three-dimensional, intact brain tissue. Using USeqFISH, we profiled the transduction of pooled systemic AAVs carrying unique barcodes across tens of genetically defined cell types in diverse mouse brain regions, revealing the distinct cell-subtype tropism of each variant. We also demonstrated the applicability of USeqFISH to the non-human primate (NHP) brain, showing its potential translation into in situ AAV profiling and multimodal, single-cell, intact-tissue analysis in this species. We believe these two approaches provide a powerful, high-throughput technology that will accelerate the engineering of targeted non-invasive gene delivery vectors and bring us closer to successfully translating AAV vectors into safer, more accessible gene therapeutics.\n\nMichael S.

When a single morphosyntactic feature gets more than one form, we call it allomorphy. Recent work has embraced the idea that something similar or identical happens in the semantics, sometimes referred to as allosemy: a single morphosyntactic feature can get more than one meaning. In this talk, I show how allosemy resolves a long-standing tension in the analysis of action nominalizations, which have been understood since Grimshaw 1990 to be systematically ambiguous. For example, transmission can have basically the same meaning as the verb transmit (as in ‘Jyn Erso’s transmission of the Death Star plans’) or it can refer to a concrete object (as in ‘The transmission is lying on the floor’). The tension is that the systematic ambiguity suggests that nominalizations should have a uniform structure, but one reading suggests that the structure contains a verb phrase, while the other suggests the opposite. I review arguments based on Icelandic data that all readings of nominalizations can and should be derived from a single structure, by inserting different allosemes into that structure. After showing how this resolves the analytical tension, I compare allosemy and allomorphy more broadly, and suggest that they really are parallel — the same basic mechanism operating in different interfaces — despite two intriguing differences in how they seem to be used.\n\nJoin us for a day of exploring the careers of physician-scientists and their impact on medicine and health.\n\nSchedule:\n\n8:15 - 9:00 am Breakfast and Poster Set-up\n\nBreakfast will be provided.\n\n9:00 am - 9:15 am Introductory Remarks (Dean Mukesh K.
