        "text": "By Scott Ross\n\nI am about to admit to a level of cinematic heresy that will likely, to some, invalidate everything I have ever written about the movies.\n\nI have never cared much for Greta Garbo.\n\nCertainly I can see how pulchritudinous she was, just as I recognize how different she seemed from the general run of American picture stars of her time. I still find her a bore — except in Ninotchka.\n\nIf you stop to analyze it, the comedies of the early talking-picture era (from roughly 1933 or ’34 to around 1939) share a number of factors in common, and what is often the most remarkable (if un-remarked upon) is who wrote and who made them: Paramount Pictures had the market cornered on smart, sophisticated, witty dialogue comedies but Columbia made them too, as did Warners, although theirs tended to be a little cruder, and even staid old conservative MGM produced some daffy screwballs. The same writers’ and directors’ names show up in connection with great talkie comedy as well, directors like Howard Hawks, George Cukor and Leo McCarey (and later, Preston Sturges) and screenwriters such as Samson Raphaelson, Ben Hecht (with our without Charles MacArthur), Viña Delmar, Robert Riskin, Donald Ogden Stewart, Sidney Buchman, Jules Furthman, Morrie Ryskind and Charles Lederer. Frank Capra is sometimes included in this group but aside from It Happened One Night his comedies tend to be lugubrious, not sharp and snappy, and weighted down with phony populist Social Significance. The filmmaker whose name was most synonymous with bright, sexy Europe-set romantic comedy was Ernst Lubitsch, usually although not always working from a Raphaelson script. Their 1932 Trouble in Paradise has long seemed to me the epitome of soignée adult comedy (Dwight MacDonald wrote that it was “as close to perfection as anything I have ever seen in the movies”) and Ninotchka, although it was produced under a more stringently-observed Production Code than its predecessor, has the same seemingly effortless sparkle and sheen.\n\nBilly Wilder, who shared the screenplay credit on Ninotchka with his writing partner Charles Brackett, on loan from Paramount, along with Walter Reisch, told his biographer Maurice Zolotow that Lubitsch took a trip to Russia in the late ’30s and came back shaken, and silent about what had disturbed him. Around the same time MGM wanted a comedy for Garbo and it fell to Reisch to come up with a three-line suggestion that tied Soviet Russia, Greta Garbo and Ernst Lubitsch together. (Melchior Lengyel was credited with the story Lubitsch eventually filmed.) An anti-Soviet satire, the picture is more interested in depicting the way its heroine is softened by romance than in making endless, sour jokes about Stalin. Indeed, Reisch’s conclusion (“Capitalism not so bad after all”) is not entirely supported by the depiction of White Russians in Paris as exemplified by Ina Claire as the Grand Duchess Swana who stands almost as a living embodiment of the titled parasitism that afflicted (if not infested) Czarist Russia. Of course, Ninotchka is herself a jest on the Soviet, the sort of emotionless doctrinaire automaton many in the West imagined all Party functionaries to be, so it all balances out. She at least is mutable, which is more than can be said of Swana, the type of woman raised to believe that her needs are the most important in the world, and any itch she suffers demands an army of uncomplaining plebians to scratch it. Free of charge, of course… to her.\n\nNinotchka is so beautifully observed by Lubitsch, so charmingly written by Wilder & Co. and so disarmingly played, by Garbo as well as everyone else in its cast, it seems not merely the product of another century but another planet from the one we now inhabit. It contains gorgeous black-and-white cinematography by William H. Daniels and a marvelous company of actors beginning with Garbo and the splendid Melvyn Douglas as the genteel gigolo for whom Ninotchka falls, Sig Rumann, Felix Bressart and Alexander Granach as the three rogue apparatchiks Nina Yakushova is sent to France to collect, and Claire, and carrying through to George Tobias as a hilariously intransigent Russian visa official and Richard Carle as Douglas’ valet, appalled at the idea of being liberated from oppression. (Bela Lugosi also shows up as Ninotchka’s dour superior, but it’s a nothing role. How swiftly was the star of Dracula reduced to such things.) The picture is filled with wonderful set-pieces and bubbling comic dialogue yet the single funniest line, one of Garbo’s in response to Douglas’ effervescent romanticism, is all of three syllables.\n\nNote: The Ninotchka advertising tag-line (“Garbo Laughs”) was a take-off on the slogan for the 1930 Anna Christie, Garbo’s first sound picture (“Garbo Talks!”) and was the product of Howard Dietz‘s fertile mind.\n\nIf ever a musical defined the word “unnecessary,” it’s Silk Stockings. I can imagine that someone (probably Feuer and Martin, the original producers of the Broadway show) thought that Ninotchka plus Cole Porter was a natural. The Porter of 1948 or 1950 might possibly have come up with a musical score that matched or at least approximated the Lubitsch/Brackett and Wilder original but the Porter of 1954, when the show was written, could do little but manufacture Cole Porter Moments, more or less consistent with similar numbers in his better musicals. Perhaps I’m being too tough on Porter, but since I admire him almost inordinantly the songs in Silk Stockings depress me almost as much as the Broadway-style jokes and playing-to-the-groundlings gags and “business.” Nothing depresses me more, however, than this having been Fred Astaire’s final MGM musical, and his last screen musical of any consequence. He was allegedly disturbed by the increasing chronological distance between himself and the young females with whom he was starring, and he was right to be; in certain shots the age spots on his hands and the wrinkled flesh on his neck cruelly betray his age. And for what? Warmed-over anti-Soviet satire and terrible numbers like “The Red Blues,” in which it is obvious all Porter could come up with was a punning title, so he just keeps repeating it, to a faux-Slavic melody, for ten minutes.\n\nWorse, for an Astaire musical there are only three creative dances. (Four, if you count Porter’s idiotic “The Ritz Roll ‘n’ Rock,” which I don’t.) One, to another anemic Porter anthem, “Fated to Be Mated,” performed with aplomb by Fred and Cyd Charisse in and around a curiously un-cluttered movie studio property area, is charming. Another, Astaire and Charisse dancing to “All of You,” is little more than a recap of all the romantic ballroom numbers Fred had done elsewhere. The first, “Stereophonic Sound,” is satire that works on-stage, where it lampoons all those technological innovations embraced by an increasingly desperate Hollywood to lure in paying customers happy to give up the movie habit for what’s on offer in their living rooms (“You gotta have glorious Technicolor/Breathtaking CinemaScope/And Stereophonic Sound!”) Performed in a movie, which was itself filmed in CinemaScope and Eastman Color and using 4-track stereo, it seems to be making fun of the very picture we’re watching. What on earth is the point of that? It makes you long for the genuine Hollywood satire of Singin’ in the Rain. That Astaire was still the greatest popular dancer in America, even into his 60s, was evidenced in his subsequent three “Evenings with Fred Astaire,” from 1958 to 1960 and his fourth, “The Fred Astaire Show,” in 1968, in all of which he featured Barrie Chase, whom he met while working on Silk Stockings. It isn’t Fred that’s the problem, it’s the movies in which he starred. He was pretty clearly uninspired by the stuff in this one.\n\nThe director, Rouben Mamoulian, supposedly chosen because he was a Russian-Armenian exile and would have an appreciation for the story’s comic anti-Sovietism, seemed to have no notion of what to do or how to frame the thing. He had once been an imaginative, if artsy, filmmaker but the new technology appears to have defeated him; Silk Stockings is among the squarest and most boringly literal, and artificial, of all Arthur Freed/MGM musicals. The movie needed a Minnelli or a Donen and got a Norman Taurog. But what could any director do with Cyd Charisse? Dancing she was a star. Singing she was somebody else, usually Carol Richards. Speaking she was numbing, her line-readings, as Stephen Harvey wrote in his Pyramid Movie History book on Astaire, “Novocain-tinged.” Need I add that when she intones the three-syllables I mentioned above, the line lands with an audible thud? Even Astaire, normally so silkily urbane, cannot speak the ardent lines, “Oh, Ninotchka, Ninotchka!” as Melvyn Douglas did without sounding foolish.\n\nThat the performer least attuned to musicals (Peter Lorre) is the most amusing to watch in his numbers says something about your movie, and it isn’t good. Janis Paige gets the brassy-broad songs (“Satin and Silk” and “Josephine”) and she quickly becomes tiresome too, although I admit her role is stupidly written — she’s an Esther Williams-type swimming star whose running-gag is trying to get water out of one ear, a bit that must have lain them in the aisles in what Eliot M. Camerana calls sophisticated Noo Yawk. It took three librettists (George S. Kaufman, Leueen MacGrath and Abe Burrows) to come up with this tripe to begin with, and three more (Leonard Gershe and Leonard Spigelgass, plus an uncredited Harry Kurnitz) to transmogrify it, embossed in gold and presented as if it was Holy Writ, to the screen. The one pleasant surprise is hearing Porter’s “All of You” in, amazingly, an un-Bowdlerized, Production Code-approved version, complete with double entendre; I guess the censors didn’t get that Astaire was singing about Charisse’s body, especially in that jaw-dropping reference to gaining control of “the east, west, north and/The south of [her].” The wooden-headedness of Silk Stockings is made manifest in a single throwaway moment: When Charisse as Ninotchka opens up her portable typewriter and begins cobbling together a report on the wayward commissars (Jules Munshin, Joseph Buloff and Lorre in this edition) it’s immediately apparent than she’s just rhythmically slamming her fingers over the keys. She doesn’t even attempt to look as if she’s actually typing. Was everyone involved in this thing asleep at the wheel?\n\nText copyright 2024 by Scott Ross\n\nAs ever, click on the highlighted links for complete reviews (&cet.)\n\nBy Scott Ross\n\nThe Terminator (1984) Asked where the plot for this accomplished and highly entertaining fantasy thriller came from, its writer and director James Cameron blithely replied, “Oh, I ripped off a couple of Harlan Ellison stories.” Unfortunately for him, and for Orion, which financed the picture, the person to whom Cameron said this was Tracy Tormé, son of Mel and a friend of Ellison’s; already suspicious that The Terminator, which he admitted to loving, too closely resembled his short story “Soldier from Tomorrow” and his own adaptation of it as “Soldier” for a 1964 episode of “The Outer Limits,” Ellison sued. The result, aside from an undisclosed out-of-court financial settlement, was screen credit, although even that was handled in a grudging manner, during the final credits, appearing on the screen while most of the audience was standing up and turning toward the theater aisle. (Generally speaking, it’s only nuts like me who stay to the last credit, to the annoyance of theater employees attempting to clean up the auditorium.) Cameron reminds me of Mark Twain’s observation about the burglar who “isn’t the least sorry he stole but is terribly sorry he got caught,” and I mention all of this because its says something fundamental about the man.* He could have gone directly to Ellison, or even to the “Outer Limits” rights-holders, and made a deal for the story, but was instead content to plagiarize the work of one of his betters, smugly believing no one would notice and that even if he admitted to the theft outright he’d get away with it. Cut to Harlan Ellison chomping a carrot and saying, “Ehhh… he don’t know me vewwy well, do he?”\n\nThe Music Man (1962) The wonderful Meredith Willson musical, given a fulsome representation by the Bros. Warner which among other things preserves Robert Preston’s star-making Broadway performance.\n\nBabes in Toyland (1934) If Hal Roach had to keep putting Laurel and Hardy into filmed versions of old operettas, the very least he might have done was to make them all as charming and funny as this one. Frank Butler and Nick Grinde’s amusing screenplay places the boys (as Ollie Dee and Stannie Dum) as incompetent assistants to the Toymaker (William Burress) scheming to stop the nasty miser Silas Barnaby (Henry Brandon) from evicting their landlady, the Old Woman Who Lived in a Shoe, aka the Widow Peep (Florence Roberts), streamlines the Victor Herbert/Glen MacDonough score so we don’t have to sit through a lot of fustian vocalization and throws in a mob of nightmarish creatures called the Bogeymen to serve as Barnaby’s creepy hench-things. Rather amazingly, Roach and MGM got permission from Walt Disney to include not merely the song “Who’s Afraid of the Big Bad Wolf?” and Three Pigs who resemble the trio in his 1933 cartoon but even Mickey Mouse, seen as a well-animated puppet with a strangely fat, monkeyish (or perhaps rat-like?) tail.\n\nPossibly because they don’t sing as much as they might have, Charlotte Henry and Felix Knight make an engaging Bo-Peep and Tom-Tom, Brandon (billed as Henry Kleinbach, and only 22!) overacting outrageously is a perfectly hissable villain, Burress an understandably irritated Toymaker, and if your eyes are sharp you may catch Ellen Corby and Charlie Hall as townspeople, Tiny Sandford as the Dunker who administers Ollie’s punishment (Stan, of course, with his usual luck, is spared his) and Dickie Jones and the young Gene Reynolds among Toyland’s children. Hardy often said, with characteristic modesty and without the slightest trace of self-pity, that he was merely second-banana to one of the greatest comedians in the world and while those of us who love this team disagree vociferously with Ollie’s self-assessment it’s certainly true that Stan usually gets the most memorable gags and set-pieces such as, here, Stannie Dum’s demonstration of his prowess with the game of “Pee Wee,” which Ollie Dee attempts to best, with entirely predictable results.\n\nThe picture was reissued in the 1950s as March of the Wooden Soldiers, and Walt Disney made his own version in 1961 with Gene Sheldon and Henry Calvin, immortal to us lovers of “The Dick Van Dyke Show” as Ollie in a sketch with Van Dyke, as Laurel and Hardy-type characters.\n\nAmarcord (1973) Federico Fellini’s bittersweet reminiscence of his 1930s adolescence in the Adriatic seaside town of Rimini. Funny, sad and filled with wonders.\n\nNever Cry Wolf (1983) If you have not read Farley Mowat’s 1963 memoir you may enjoy this Disney live-action adaptation of it. Being a Mowat admirer, I found it beautiful but dismayingly inexplicable. It took three credited screenwriters (Curtis Hanson, Sam Hamm and Richard Kletter), one uncredited one (Ralph Furmaniak) and an additional trio (Eugene Corr and Christina Luescher and the star, Charles Martin Smith, under an alias) to botch Mowat’s (allegedly fictionalized) account of his study of Alaskan wolves and to, instead of using the author’s voice, thoroughly obliterate it. What’s left is some remarkable cinematography by Hiro Narita, often lovely direction by Carroll Ballard, a likeable performance by Smith, and a horrible lot of hokum, served up with relish. This includes Brian Dennehy’s role as a reckless pilot who later shows up as a newly-minted entrepreneur bent on destroying the Alaskan wilderness as he exploits it (the pilot of the book does no such thing, nor is he the genial sadist of the movie), a reversal of the ages of the two Inuits who befriend Mowat, and the inescapable implication at the end that the younger has betrayed the adult wolves for profit and orphaned the cubs, a portrayal which ought to have been actionable. When the picture sticks to the events Mowat described it’s good entertainment; when it doesn’t, the movie stinks. The irretrievable wrong-headedness of the thing is made manifest in the scene in which Smith grabs up a piece of the caribou the pack is eating to prove to himself that the animal had bone disease and the wolves, instead of tearing out his throat, passively back away from the carcass. Pull the other one, Ballard.\n\nThe Aristocats (1970) The enjoyable but anachronistic (and linguistically schizophrenic) Disney animated feature.\n\nSwiss Miss (1938) An extremely silly demi-musical featuring (alas, not starring) Laurel and Hardy and redeemed solely by them and, by their encounters with a gorilla. In the Swiss Alps. Which makes as much sense as anything else in this idiot musical in which Walter Wolf King, who three years earlier beat Harpo Marx and got made to look ridiculous during a performance of Il Trovatore, is a composer of, on the evidence of the movie, bad operettas who sequesters himself in the mountains to write his magnum opus. (Some of the nastiness of that previous performance seems to cling to him here, or perhaps he was simply, like Kevin Spacey, unpleasant in any role.) Della Lind simpers broadly as his soprano-star wife, while Eric Blore is utterly wasted as King’s manager, behaving more like a cowering manservant. Stan and Ollie are mousetrap salesmen stranded in the Alps, Adia Kuznetzoff is the mean chef who enslaves them, and the diminutive make-up man Charles Gemora is the gorilla, whose final act of vengeance against the boys absolutely killed me. It seems to have been inspired by the climax of the team’s second talkie short, the 1929 Berth Marks but, perhaps because the gag in Swiss Miss was filmed at greater distance, and with a longer or wider lens, it’s correspondingly that much funnier.\n\nStan was allegedly exasperated with Hal Roach’s editorial meddling, and Roach cut sequences willy-nilly, as when a musical number with Stan and Ollie involving mousetraps is cut off before it can even begin. There were some otherwise good writers on this one, so I won’t embarrass their shades by mentioning their names. In the funny sequence in which Stan attempts to rook a vigilant St. Bernard dog out of his flask of brandy, by the way, Stan’s belly puts paid to the idea that Stan Laurel was “the skinny one.” As Penn Jillette has pointed out, Laurel is only thin in contrast to Hardy.\n\nMacbeth (1948) Made as a personal challenge at the Poverty Row Republic Pictures studio for under $1 million and in only 24 days, Orson Welles‘ second major tilt at “The Scottish Play” after the so-called “Voodoo Macbeth” in Harlem is one of the great Shakespeare movies, especially in its restored edition which returns his actors’ Scots burrs, re-dubbed by the filmmaker at the insistence of Republic.\n\nArabesque (1966) An entertaining trifle wrestled to the ground and pinned repeatedly by a self-indulgent Stanley Donen, who apparently felt his had to “save” the material with elaborate, arty camera tricks that do little but annoy the viewer. One of the era’s many knock-offs of Charade, itself directed by Donen, involving a pair of box-office idols in an elaborate comedy-mystery with violent overtones, Arabesque concerns international espionage involving Gregory Peck and Sophia Loren, the latter dripping with Yves Saint-Laurent in every scene. The occasionally witty script was written by Julian Mitchell, Stanley Price and the Charade screenwriter Peter Stone under his pseudonym Pierre Marton, which tells you he was not happy with what they ended up with, and while it doesn’t add up to much surely it didn’t require the sort of mad stylistic rococo Donen imposed on the material. Aside from the stars, who are relaxed and funny, the best things in Arabesque are Henry Mancini’s alternately tense and soignée musical score, the silkily creepy and vaguely psychopathic performance by Alan Badel as the villain and, when Donen allows him space to breathe and isn’t asking him to muck things up with fish-eye lenses and absurd camera angles, Christopher Challis’ lovely widescreen color cinematography.\n\nThe Gypsy Moths (1969) This beautifully-rendered adaptation by John Frankenheimer (direction) and the playwright William Hanley (screenplay) of James Drought’s exceptional short novel is one of the unheralded wonders of late-’60s American filmmaking.\n\nThe Bliss of Mrs. Blossom (1968) A silly, funny, eye-poppingly “mod” 1960s sex-farce with Shirley MacLaine at her most appealing, more or less happily married to the sexless brassiere manufacturer played by Richard Attenborough but keeping a younger lover (James Booth) in the attic for years. (Somewhat amazingly, the basic notion was based on a real case.) Adapted by Alec Coppel and Denis Norden from Coppel’s stage play, it’s a self-conscious piece of comedic pop-art that is almost consistently engaging, gorgeously shot by Geoffrey Unsworth and directed with wit by Joseph McGrath. Made in 1966, The Bliss of Mrs. Blossom sat on the shelf for two years, an indication of Paramount’s lack of faith in the project. That time-lapse probably cost the picture its audience; it’s very much of movie of 1966, almost a period-piece two years later. The critics were certainly divided on it: Time Out‘s notice contended that it was “coarse comedy which looks a little like Joe Orton gone disastrously wrong.” There’s something to that criticism. The picture does feel a bit like a less socially satirical imitation of Orton, especially in the inclusion of an effeminate (yet possibly heterosexual?) police detective played with wild abandon by Freddie Jones, and Bob Monkhouse’s psychoanalyst, who is possibly madder than his patients. The comedy also sags a bit toward the end. But most of it is engaging and, if not knock-down hilarious, gives the viewer a consistent smile of pleasure. Among its delights are the spritely score by Riz Ortolani, the vivid production design of Assheton Gorton, the cheerfully crazy costumes by Jocelyn Rickards, the wonderful paintings by Sally Scott and some droll supporting performances by, among others, William Rushton, Patricia Routledge, Barry Humphries and, in a sequence that almost seems a precursor to one of his Monty Python sketches, John Cleese as an uproariously uncertain post office clerk.\n\nThe novelty act The New Vaudeville Band appears in a party sequence, filmed a year before the group, astonishingly, copped the Best Contemporary Single Grammy for “Winchester Cathedral” over The Association’s “Cherish,” The Beach Boys’ “Good Vibrations,” The Monkees’ “Last Train to Clarksville,” The Mamas & the Papas’ “Monday, Monday” and The Beatles’ “Eleanor Rigby.”\n\nThe Baker’s Wife (La Femme du Boulanger; 1938) Another, very different, comedy about adultery, and one I wish I liked better than I do, especially considering its elaborate reputation. Written and directed by Marcel Pagnol from an episode in the Jean Giono novel Blue Boy and with dialogue by Pagnol and Giono, it’s a poetic-realist fable about the new baker in an isolated Provençal town whose young wife goes off with an amorous shepherd, causing him to cease caring about making bread. As with the work of Jean Renoir, Pagnol is concerned with the people in his pictures, and I’m afraid that may be why I have a difficult time responding positively or emotionally to either man’s movies, even as I admire them: I tend to regard their characters as types, or symbols, but in any case outside my ken. (Feudal Japan is more graspable to me than early 20th century France.) The people in these movies can be arresting or amusing but they don’t, somehow, feel entirely real as even the most outlandish characters in, say, a Lubitsch comedy do. I can’t explain that.\n\nThe cinematography by Georges Benoît is lovely, especially in the print on Criterion Blu-ray, and I liked the antagonistic dialogues between the pinch-faced, censorious priest (Robert Vattier) and his opposite, the Socialist schoolteacher (Robert Bassac); while both are rendered with a satirist’s eye, it will not surprise a reader of these pages when I confess to being much more in sympathy with the latter than the former. The most impressive element in The Baker’s Wife, however, is the central performance by Raimu as the baker Aimable, which is indeed everything I’ve been hearing about it for decades. It’s total acting, without being in the least actorly. Raimu is like a genial bear with a limp which everyone notices but him, shambling along more or less happily but who, when stung by a blow from a child’s peashooter, becomes unreasonably hurt by the action. Aimable doesn’t see what everyone around him does, that his marriage is almost entirely unsuccessful and that his wife has a roving eye, and when she leaves him he falls apart.\n\nAlthough it neither moved me to tears nor even, despite Leonard Maltin’s assurance that the picture is “hilarious,” much to laughter — I prefer the lovely score of Stephen Schwartz’s flop musical version of The Baker’s Wife to its source — the movie is filled with wonderful faces and physiques among the villagers: Charles Moulin, Charles Blavette, Marcel Maupi, Fernand Charpin, Odette Roger and Maximilienne, who gives a great comic performance as a hypocritical hatchet-faced spinster. Ginette Leclerc is Aurélie, the wayward wife, and while she hasn’t much to do in the picture she shares with Raimu a beautifully observed final scene in which he finally (if obliquely) expresses his anger at her and the pair quietly come to terms.\n\n*Nor do I exempt from Cameron’s sins one Gale Anne Hurd, his producer and then-girlfriend and co-author of the script.\n\nText copyright 2024 by Scott Ross\n\nI had a friend in the Army, a sergeant, a parachutist for about twenty years. He used to say that jumping was not only a way to live, but also a way to die. Damn few things are. — Mike Rettig (Burt Lancaster)\n\nBy Scott Ross\n\nThis beautifully-rendered adaptation by John Frankenheimer (direction) and the playwright William Hanley (screenplay) of James Drought’s exceptional short novel is an unheralded wonder of late-’60s American filmmaking, and one of Frankenheimer’s two personal favorites among the pictures he made. It concerns a trio of skydivers (Burt Lancaster, Gene Hackman and Scott Wilson) over a fateful Fourth of July weekend in a small Kansas town and, as skeptical as I am about literary transmigration to film, the picture succeeds to a remarkable extent, not least due to the exhilarating aerial photography, achieved by the real stuntmen filming their own jumps, which must have been gripping on a big theater screen. Hanley and Frankenheimer wisely do not attempt to explain the inexplicable, and while I missed the voice of the Wilson character’s first-person narration, much of the more pungent dialogue in the script comes directly from the book and what doesn’t is a superb simulacrum of Drought’s style. Hanley’s only miscalculation, it seems to me, is when Lancaster’s Mike Rettig asks the woman (Deborah Kerr) in whose home the jumpers are staying to leave her strange, cold husband (William Windom) and go off with him. Dramatically, their dialogue is unimpeachable, especially Kerr’s, which explains her character almost as well as her self-revealing monologue to Lancaster before their sexual tryst, but her rejection of his offer places a possible reason for his subsequent actions that is wrong and becomes a red-herring I don’t think the filmmakers intended.\n\nAside from a couple of back-projection shots that are typically poor for that period of filmmaking and likely not his fault,* Philip H. Lathrop’s cinematography elevates the quality of the storytelling just as Frankenheimer’s measured, un-hysterical direction does. Like Sidney Lumet and George Roy Hill, who also came from live television, Frankenheimer has always struck me as one of the most thoughtful, intelligent and articulate filmmakers of his time, both in his life and behind the cameras. While he was adept at action and his work is often viscerally exciting (cf., The Manchurian Candidate, Seven Days in May, Black Sunday, French Connection II and Ronin) he understood that what makes movies — what makes all dramatic forms, from short stories and novels to plays and television dramas — memorable and of worth is the people in them and their conflicts with each other and themselves; thus is his 1973 edition of The Iceman Cometh for the American Film Theatre Frankenheimer’s finest work. In The Gypsy Moths much of this human interaction is understated, indeed even unstated. It’s in the looks the people in it give each other, or the way they don’t connect at all, or how, to cite a poignant example, as he tenderly reveals his emotional self to the woman with whom he shares a bed the Hackman character suddenly realizes she is asleep and hasn’t heard a word.\n\nLancaster and Kerr, who had been incendiary lovers in From Here to Eternity, were sixteen years older in The Gypsy Moths and both looked and seemed so. While neither were callow young things in the previous picture they’re notably middle-aged here, with the increased gravity and concerns of those who have long since left their hot youth behind. Each is eaten away with discontent, and with anomie both vague and specific. When they come together on the living room sofa with her husband on the floor above them their lovemaking has a desperate, joyless quality which the revelation of Kerr’s naked breasts does nothing to mitigate. When he asks her to leave her loveless, dispiriting life — a life in which her husband resents her for her long-ago, premarital love for Wilson’s father and in which she must take periodic lovers to keep in touch with something real — and go away with him she’s terrified by the prospect; after he says he’s offering her a way out she snaps, “I don’t want a way out!” These are lines of Hanley’s not in Drought’s book but so keenly approximate his style and idiosyncratic point of view they feel entirely organic.\n\nFrankenheimer and Lathrop use space, not aerial space, but the physical space between people, to emphasize their essential aloneness, and never in that showy cinematic fashion my friend Eliot M. Camarena calls “Look-a-me!” The characters in The Gypsy Moths are almost without exception so lonely they don’t know how to close the gap except through sex, in varying degrees of affection, and the dangerous stunt dives the parachutists perform for goggle-eyed crowds of strangers.\n\nIt certainly helps that Frankenheimer assembled a cast this good, and this intelligent. There was always a little something unknowable about Lancaster, which his big, athletic frame emphasized and his moments of cheerful bonhomie did little to dispel. His character here shares that vague sense of disquiet, and neither of Rettig’s compatriots can understand why he keeps taking unnecessary and dangerous chances. Even he may not know. Kerr brings to her performance as Elizabeth an uneasy mixture of natural warmth and learned aloofness which finds moving expression in how she reacts to seeing her estranged nephew again, wanting to embrace him but finally unable to. (Malcolm, Scott Wilson’s character, is equally uncomfortable with such intimacy with the woman who should have been his adopted mother; only at the end, after agonizing loss, and each suspecting neither will ever see the other again, do they overcome their reticence.) Kerr, who I suspect read Drought’s novel, also takes a physical cue from the description of her character’s habit of rubbing her arms as if she is cold.\n\nOn his DVD commentary, Frankenheimer heaped well-deserved praise on Gene Hackman, whom he correctly believed incapable of a bad performance. As Browdy, the practical manager of the trio, Hackman is earthy, ribald, funny and exasperating in equal measure, a devoted sensualist who nonetheless never misses a Sunday Mass. This was the period, after Bonnie and Clyde and before The French Connection, in which Hackman was quietly amassing a legacy of superb performances (Downhill Racer, in which along with the skiing sequences he was the best thing in the movie, I Never Sang for My Father) and, as Frankenheimer also notes, you never catch him acting. There is tension between all three men in the troupe and Hackman’s Browdy knows it and can do little to alleviate it except, in an unguarded moment, from punching Wilson, and apologizing sincerely for it. When he takes up with a local waitress/stripper (Sheree North) it’s only a brief respite from his anxieties, and at the end when he parts company with Wilson you get the sense that even Browdy suspects his unformed Hollywood dreams will go unrealized as he drifts into something else along the way.\n\nScott Wilson exhibits great sensitivity as the youngest member of the team, and the one who’s the most clear-headed about what’s going on. Like Browdy, Malcolm knows that Rettig is taking too many chances, and courting death with every jump, but is helpless either to discover why or to help the older man out of his unfathomable state. His connection with Annie (Bonnie Bedelia), the college boarder of his aunt and uncle, is one of the few things in his life that makes any sense or brings a sense of relief, but it too is impermanent and Wilson suggests without saying so that he both knows and regrets this transience but is incapable of altering its contours. Bedelia, whose first picture this was, could not be bettered, nor could North as the amiable stripper or Windom as the distant husband. Elmer Bernstein contributed one of his brief, emotionally resonant scores to the picture, including a main theme that encapsulates the melancholy quality of the divers’ lives, their yearnings and the excitement of the stunts. I feel I should also mention Henry Berman’s fluid editing, the aerial stuntmen and photographers (J. David Jones, Carl Boenisch, Ray De La Motte and Jay Gifford) who contributed such thrilling verisimilitude to the dives, and the costumes by Bill Thomas, particularly those he created for Deborah Kerr’s Elizabeth. When we first see her she’s in a soft white organdy and later, an unsightly, shapeless green sack; it’s as if she gussied herself up to meet her guests and, having slept with one of them and bared more than her body with him, no longer feels the need to show herself off in front of anyone. I was also taken with the set decoration by Henry Grace and Jack Mills which includes, in Elizabeth’s kitchen, several of those copper jelly molds which housewives of the time were so taken with but which seldom, if ever, served as anything other than wall decoration. (My mother had some too, and never made anything in them.) That makes its own statement, even if only a few of us notice it.\n\nThe Gypsy Moths was sabotaged by MGM, which gave it a perfunctory release, with little fanfare, and then shelved it. Or perhaps I should say it was torpedoed by James Aubrey, who ran the studio at the time, and eventually ran it into the ground. As a bizarre footnote, when John Frankenheimer mentioned Aubrey critically specifically on his 2002 commentary, Warner Bros. dropped out his voice, censoring the name. Why was the owner of MGM’s film library still protecting the man known universally as the Smiling Cobra, who had died nearly a decade earlier? Were they afraid his ghost would sue?\n\n*Those bad insert shots were necessary, to show the faces of the lead actors during the dives.\n\nText copyright 2024 by Scott Ross\n\nBy Scott Ross\n\nThe Disney writers, composers, designers and animators responsible for the studio’s enormous 1967 hit The Jungle Book also produced this linguistically schizophrenic feline adventure, which made only slightly less than its predecessor. If The Jungle Book was occasionally too hip for its own good, the verbal and musical anachronisms were limited to Phil Harris’ Baloo and Louis Prima’s King Louis, and their echoes by the boy Mowgli. Here there’s an entire sub-set of cat characters who bring a deliberate late ’60s vibe to what is supposed to be post-Fin de siècle Paris. The picture is set in 1910, yet not only does a bunch of literal hep-cats play jazz (or a facsimile of it) itself only being developed, in New Orleans, at the time, but their guitarist is a 1968 hippie, complete with long hair, shades and love-beads. It’s the sort of lapse that is taken for granted today but which tended to throw people in 1967 when Harris routinely threw around words like “swinging” and phrases like “get with the beat” and the Beatles were evoked (or at any rate, John Lennon was) by a quartet of vultures in what one presumed was the Indian jungle of the 1800s. By 1970 this indifference to chronology had solidified into a house style, and an irritating one; as a child I was vaguely bugged by the anachronisms in The Jungle Book even as I adored it.\n\nAlong with replicating The Jungle Book‘s relaxed attitude toward time, location and language, The Aristocats inaugurated the “Hee-Haw”-ization of Disney animation by throwing Southern American characters, usually voiced by George Lindsey and Pat Buttram (with Ken Curtis thrown in as a wild-card, as in the 1973 Robin Hood) into places and situations where they manifestly do not belong. Thus we get Napoleon and Lafayette, two Deep Southern hounds who’ve inexplicably landed on a farm in the rural outskirts of Paris. The rub is that the sequences in which these two canine miscreants appear, and through their love of giving chase to motor vehicles inadvertently gum up the plots of the duplicitous English butler Edgar (English butler? to a Parisian former opera star?) are, admittedly, the funniest in the movie; the Aristocats team had only planned one but when they saw how effective the first was, immediately went to work on a sequel. (The dogs also get the picture’s final laugh, a good variation on an old vaudeville routine and the payoff to one of the movie’s verbal running-gags.)\n\nThe overlarding of famous figures is the result, from The Jungle Book on, of the Disney animation unit’s embrace of celebrity voices to, I believe, the detriment of the movies in which they were heard, because the celebrity became the character rather than the reverse. (The only “star” voices I can think of in a Disney cartoon feature before this time who weren’t hired strictly as vocalists were Cliff Edwards, the Jiminy Cricket of Pinocchio and Ed Wynn and Jerry Colonna, the Mad Hatter and the March Hare, respectively, in Alice in Wonderland, and neither of the latter was as famous in the 1950s as he’d been in the 1930s and ’40s.) With The Aristocats, half the cast were contemporary stars, on television: The Hungarian Eva Gabor as the French cat Duchess and Buttram as the bloodhound Napoleon, both of “Green Acres”; Lindsey (the basset Lafayette) of “Mayberry, R.F.D.”; and Nancy Kulp (“The Beverly Hillbillies”) as the speaking voice of (appropriately) the horse Frou-Frou, with Ruth Buzzi (“Laugh-In”) singing for her at the end. Paul Winchell, known chiefly for his television work as ventriloquist and voice-over artist, provided the speaking voice of the unfortunate, piano-playing Siamese cat, a characterization seemingly calculated to insult every Chinese viewer in the world, and this is not to mention Thurl Ravenscroft, eternally the commercial voice of Tony the Tiger for Kelloggs, as the bass-playing Russian alley cat and Vito Scotti, known primarily to TV viewers, as a concertina-playing cat. Monica Evans and Carole Shelley, who provided the voices of a pair of sibling geese, weren’t as familiar, and weren’t from TV, but their characters are essentially waterfowl variations on their Pigeon sisters in Neil Simon’s The Odd Couple.\n\nI may be giving the impression I don’t care for The Aristocats. I do; it’s a pleasant, likeable picture, beautifully designed by Ken Anderson and effectively if coolly directed by Wolfgang Reitherman. Yet it’s also dramaturgically irresponsible, in a way that was taken less for granted by the wider culture in 1970 than it has since proved but was already becoming the somewhat depressing norm at the Disney studios. Walt’s people (including Disney himself before his death in late 1966) seemed to think that everything in an animated feature could be either Anglicized or Americanized, from characterizations to songs to dialogue, treated to modern slang, with nationalities mixed profligately among the voices, and that none of it would matter, or be noticed. They were probably right to assume the latter. Yet when Edgar, discovering he’s the sole beneficiary of Madame’s will only after the cats are gone, sputters, “After all, there are millions of reasons why I should [get rid of them]. All of them dollars!” as dollar signs appear in his eyes, it’s a disconcerting effect: In the France of 1910 surely those millions would be francs. This linguistic and histrionic latitude bordering on chauvinism and extended toward pretty much everything led, eventually, to such atrocities as Eddie Murphy voicing a wise-cracking, presumably black American, dragon in 4th century China, a characterization (and a character) that ruined an otherwise impressive movie. The tone was off: Mulan wasn’t a wild, Looney Tunes-influenced Aladdin or Hercules, where nothing was to be taken seriously and a Robin Williams djinn or a supernatural villain voiced by a sarcastic James Woods were simply part of the overall craziness; the anachronisms and the olio of accents in pictures like The Aristocats inevitably take you out of the story. Charles Lane was a wonderful character actor, for example, but hearing his distinctly American voice speaking lines for the French lawyer of Hermione Baddeley’s millionairess (British, with no French overlay) is as jarring as the mix of accents (British and American) employed by Duchess’ trio of kittens. (No one ever says she’s a widow, so exactly where did they come from, anyway?)\n\nThe musical score, as with The Jungle Book, is schizophrenic too. As usual, the songs by Richard M. Sherman and Robert B. Sherman are respecters of setting and period whereas those by Terry Gilkyson and the team of Floyd Huddleston and Al Rinker are much looser and less specific. From the latter comes the movie’s big production number, the allegedly jazzy “Ev’rybody Wants to Be a Cat,” which (especially in its refrain) actually sounds more like mild rock-n-roll, and from the former the ring-a-ding-ding Sinatraesque “Thomas O’Malley Cat” for Phil Harris. The alley cat band was supposed to have been fronted by Louis Armstrong, who had also been Walt’s hope for King Louie in The Jungle Book until someone, blessedly, realized how incredibly insensitive it would be to ask a black man to voice a cartoon ape; this time, alas, Armstrong’s poor health precluded his involvement.* (He did, however, cut an LP for Disney’s Buena Vista label, the 1968 Disney Songs the Satchmo Way.)† Armstrong’s replacement, the actor-singer Scatman Crothers, does a very creditable job if you don’t know who they originally wanted, slightly less so if you do. (He was reportedly asked to perform as if he was Armstrong.) Too many of the Shermans’ songs were cut during pre-production, including the lovely “She Never Felt Alone,” planned as a solo for Madame and a reprise by Duchess but eventually reduced to a brief spoken interlude over music. (Robie Lester, the Disney answer to Marnie Nixon, dubbed Gabor’s singing voice.) I have a feeling the number of songs by the Shermans cut from The Aristocats was a large part of the reason the brothers left Disney, where they had been house composers since the early ’60s, around this time. One could scarcely blame them, when their contributions were limited in the final picture to two numbers, the charming “Scales and Arpeggios” (albeit trimmed of a chorus) and the bright main title song, for which the team coaxed Maurice Chevalier out of retirement. Note that Chevalier eschews the Shermans’ Americanized “Paree” in favor “Paris,” which elides the rhyme of “Paree/pedigree” but gives the old trooper some Gallic dignity.\n\nAside from his production design, Ken Anderson also worked on the screen story, along with, among others, Larry Clemmons, Frank Thomas and Ralph Wright. (Tom Rowe wrote the book on which it was based, which was then elaborated upon by Harry Tytle and Tom McGowan.) The Disney veteran Al Dempster did backgrounds and the animating directors included “Old Men” Milt Kahl, Eric Larson, John Lounsbery, Ollie Johnston and the protean Thomas, solely in charge of Duchess, O’Malley, Amelia and Abigail, Napoleon, Lafayette and Edgar. Among the splendid non-star voices were those of Bill Thompson, the originator of the phlegmatic Droopy for Tex Avery, as the Gabbles’ genially soused Uncle Waldo; Sterling Holloway as the helpful mouse Roquefort (apparently no one at Disney had heard of a Terry-Toon rodent by that name); and Roddy Maude-Roxby, dripping imperturbable two-faced sang-froid as Edgar. George Bruns composed the nifty underscore, which is especially memorable in the Napoleon and Lafayette sequences and, although it borrows outrageously from Henry Mancini’s “Baby Elephant Walk,” the waddling theme for the geese. The characteristically spritely orchestrations were by Walter Sheets.\n\nThe Aristocats, made for $4 million, took in only slightly less than its predecessor ($10 million to The Jungle Book‘s $11.5), was a huge hit in France and even more popular in Germany. Proving, I suppose, that anachronism sells, in Europe as well as America.\n\n*Just to illustrate how a Disney-obsessed child’s mind works (or at least, how my Disney-obsessed mind worked): In 1968 I was convinced by his singing style and his scatting that the eventual King Louie, Louis Prima, was black. And when my father and his brother went to a dime-a-dozen sale of 45s one afternoon and brought back a copy of Louis Armstrong’s 1964 hit “Hello, Dolly!,” I at first confused him with Prima. (That is, until I listened to the record.) It wasn’t until I was much older that I understood Prima was Italian. Had I looked more closely at my parents’ compact record collection, I would have seen a representation of that other Louis in their copy of the live 1956 Ambassador Satch LP. For some reason, I didn’t notice that one until the early ’70s when I pulled it out, played it and became an Armstrong fan for life.\n\n†With The Lion King, a black actor (Robert Guillaume) did voice an ape, the mandrill Rafiki, but he was a mystical character, not a lazy, pleasure-seeking comic like Louie. In any case, almost no one commented on Rafiki other than the Professionally Aggrieved who seek for, and find, “isms” in everything: Rafiki was thus a racist concept because he, voiced by a black man, works for a white lion. Not an actual white lion (although there was one in the background, Kimba, the 1950s anime character whose name and background are suspiciously similar to those of “Simba” but whom everyone at Disney still pretends didn’t exist) but a lion whose voice belonged to a Caucasian. And never mind that everyone works for a king, or that his father was James Earl Jones. Such is the game these types play, and which nearly everyone else with a functioning brain is becoming thoroughly fed up with.\n\nText copyright 2024 by Scott Ross\n\nBy Scott Ross\n\nIf there is such a thing as perfect musical play, The Music Man qualifies. I’ve loved it since first encountering the movie adaptation of it on television when I was 11; that love deepened on my attending a live stage presentation at age 13 and expanded fully when, five years later, I stage-managed a production of it in the spring of my senior year in high school. What gives it, to my mind, a quality above the general run of American musical theatre of its time, and even since, is its astonishing assurance and a concomitant brilliance of execution, both in its musical and its dramatic elements. I say “astonishing” because it was the first such effort by a man who had never written a musical, and while he had assistance, from Franklin Lacey on the book and (or so I suspect) from his mentor Frank Loesser on a few of the lyrics and perhaps even some of the music, Meredith Willson’s triumph in December, 1957 was not only that he had essentially created what would become a classic musical comedy from scratch, but that he hit every dramatic note with such seeming ease. From its remarkable opening to its crowd-pleasing finale, The Music Man has the unity and accomplishment of a light masterwork, and Willson had no business to do it.\n\nYet Meredith Willson was uniquely placed to write this show. Virtually a lifelong musician — when he evoked John Phillip Sousa in “76 Trombones” he knew what he was talking about; he played flute and piccolo in Sousa’s band for three years in the 1920s — and his Mason City, Iowa background informs (to use an idiom he would have appreciated) every jot and tittle of his musical’s characters, action and dialogue. What some commentators saw as the show’s “corn” is in fact astute social comedy, refracted through the mature sensibilities of a child of its time grown to maturity and able, as James Thurber was, to see his former elders with a humorist’s eye without ridiculing them as a mere caricaturist would. (One wonders whether it was the Iowa corn-country setting of the play that suggested that word to Willson’s critics.) Moreover, in many of his lyrics Willson employed rhythmic talk in a way that had never been heard before on the Broadway stage, at least to this level and frequency, and his use of it begins in the show’s opening moments.\n\nDuring rehearsals for the show that marked my theatre debut at age 12, our director was at pains to explain to those of us who had not appeared in a musical before (half the cast) the importance of the opening number which, she stressed, sets the tone for the show; you tell the audience what to expect from the evening. In “Rock Island,” the first number in The Music Man, Willson depicts a railway train filled with traveling salesmen debating the changes in their profession and the merits or debits of the mysterious “music man” Harold Hill in the slang of the day and with multiple references to the salesman’s long-replaced stocks-in-trade (the noggins and the piggins and the firgins) and doing so, moreover, in a way that imitates the vehicle they’re riding on, from slow locomotive pull-out to spine-jarring station arrival. A year earlier on Broadway Alan Jay Lerner and Frederick Loewe had written Rex Harrison’s My Fair Lady songs to fit his voice, which had a limited range; what Harrison as Professor Henry Higgins did was sprechtstimme, essentially speaking on pitch, and in rhythm. Higgins’ songs could be sung, as Ian Richardson proved in the 1976 My Fair Lady revival, but most actors who followed Harrison took refuge in the fact that they didn’t have to be. The salesman in The Music Man, however, are not speak-singing; they’re speaking. Mark Cabaniss, who wrote a terrible book on Willson and the show, claims that numbers like “Rock Island” and “Trouble,” Harold Hill’s initial sales pitch to the stubborn Hawkeyes of the musical’s fictional River City, are the first examples of rap on a Broadway stage, a patent imbecility which if you followed its logic would inevitably lead to the conclusion that auctioneers pioneered hip-hop in the 19th century.\n\nEven when the characters in The Music Man do sing, their lyrics are peppered with colloquialism of the period (1912) and humorous, and what’s even better, intelligent asides, as when Hill performs “The Sadder-But-Wiser Girl” for his old friend and one-time partner in crime Marcellus Washburn:\n\nI hope, and I pray\n\nFor Hester to win just one more “A”!\n\nHill as a character is one of the most articulate figures in an American musical, and he’s not just a smart-ass. He’s probably actually read The Scarlet Letter, which is more than nearly anyone else he encounters can claim. And when the mayor’s wife and her equally hidebound and censorious cronies clamor to explain to Hill why the town’s librarian, the fabled Marion Paroo, is a woman of dubious morals, their gossip takes the explicit form of a hen-party’s cacophonous squawking:\n\nPickalittle, talkalittle,\n\nPickalittle, talkalittle,\n\nCheepcheepcheep,\n\nTalkalot, pickalittlemore…\n\nMany of the character songs in The Music Man reflect the sensibilities of a man who, although a neophyte lyricist, was pretty clearly word-drunk. Willson’s prose writing reflects this; he had a bestselling memoir in 1948 called And There I Stood With My Piccolo and later wrote a very entertaining account of the writing and first production of the show entitled But He Doesn’t Know the Territory, and while the books are breezy they’re also remarkably witty. And speaking of Willson’s verbiage: During her 1975 Carnegie Hall concert Barbara Cook, the first Marion, sang the original lyric for “My White Night” which doesn’t get to the familiar chorus until a full two minutes in but which is filled with hilarious rapid-fire patter about what the character doesn’t want.\n\nNo Lothario shoe-salesman,\n\nNo band-leader, no railroad conductor\n\nOr any other charmer, either of me or anybody else.\n\nNo Chautauqua advance-agent,\n\nNo vaudevillian, no depot telegrapher\n\nI’m not dazzled over any such a kind of fascinatin’ swain.\n\nAll I want is a plain man, a modest man, a quiet man,\n\nA straightforward and honest man to sit with me\n\nIn a cottage somewhere in the state of Iowa\n\nAnd listen with a smile to a poem or a song\n\nThat is neither a five-line limerick about St. Peter and the man from Duluth,\n\nOr a sing-song lament of a purple cow…\n\nMeredith Willson was himself a popular band-leader — how Marion would have disapproved! — on radio (“The George Burns and Gracie Allen Show” and “The Big Show” with Tallulah Bankhead) and the composer/lyricist of, among other things, “The Iowa Fight Song” and the charming secular holiday carol “It’s Beginning to Look at Lot Like Christmas,” in Bing Crosby’s 1951 recording one of my childhood favorites. (I loved that line about silver lanes that glow, or as Crosby sang it, were “a-glow.”) He later wrote, as the anthem of President Kennedy’s Physical Fitness Program for school children the rhythm-speak song “Chicken Fat,” recorded by his Music Man star Robert Preston in 1962, which even in the late ’60s was a weekly feature of my second and third-grade gym class. He started working on the show that eventually became the biggest hit of his career in the late 1940s or early 1950s, going through draft after draft before engaging Franklin Lacey as co-author and Kermit Bloomgarten as producer. (Feuer and Martin courted him repeatedly but ultimately dropped out, to their eternal regret.) Meredith’s original, The Silver Triangle, focused in part on a spastic child called Jim Paroo, in danger of institution, and while this certainly seems a dubious prospect for a Broadway musical then (I can see it being done today) he was eventually persuaded to drop the character, replacing him with the lisping Winthrop Paroo, Marion’s little brother, devastated by the death of his father. The lisping child was originally limited to his refrain in the “Wells-Fargo Wagon” number, a small joke that seems a little cruel in retrospect, since Willson wanted badly to show with the spastic boy that the handicapped were to be embraced, not thrown away. Additionally, Winthrop’s singing those joyful lines despite his obvious verbal affliction, and Marion’s emotional reaction to it, is the most moving moment in the show and provides the impetus for his sister to sabotage her own intended torpedoing of Harold Hill.\n\nThe songs are not merely rhythmic, however, or funny. They’re sophisticated musically. Three times in the show Willson combines songs in contrapuntal fashion: First when the barbershop quarter sings “Goodnight, Ladies” in counterpoint to the women’s refrain of “Pickalittle, Talkalittle”; second when the composer juxtaposes a barbershop waltz (“Lida Rose”) with a paean to romantic ambivalence (“Will I Ever Tell You”?); and finally when, at the moment his anti-hero realizes his emotions are sundering his larcenous plans, he sings a reprise of “76 Trombones” while she intersperses into his pauses lines from her anthem of yearning, “Goodnight, My Someone,” until, eventually, the singers switch tunes. Nor is this simply cleverness, or good character writing (Marion and Harold are becoming intimately intertwined, in the romantic sense); Willson composed the two numbers as inverse mirrors of each other.\n\nWhat strikes me now as I look at the entire list of songs in The Music Man is how stacked it is: Thirteen numbers in Act One and Eleven in Act Two. Although five of these (“Seventy-Six Trombones,” “Pickalittle,” “Gary, Indiana,” “It’s You” and “Goodnight, My Someone”) are brief reprises, that’s still 19 individual numbers in a single score, not including dances. That’s not a record for a non-opera but it’s one of the longest song lists for a Broadway musical until Follies in 1971, yet the show doesn’t feel music-heavy, or overlong, either in song or dialogue scene. The variety of musical styles within that song-stack is remarkable too, yet each of them respects the time in which they are supposed to be sung. There isn’t a single anachronism, as far as I can tell, in the show, either in the songs or the dialogue. In popular dramatic art these days, when almost no one knows how people spoke or what sort of music they listened and danced to ten or twenty years in the past, let alone 45, there’s an anachronism every few minutes.\n\nI said The Music Man was perfect. Let me amend that: I don’t understand why little Amaryllis, who pines for Winthrop, also makes fun of the way he lisps her name. That’s a damn funny way to prove your love to someone.\n\nOther than that, I stick by my statement.\n\nThe stage musical was so large a phenomenon that it and its composer-lyricist-librettist were featured on the cover of Time magazine, and it became such a Broadway and national institution that in The Apartment, released in 1960 but set in 1959, it’s the show corporate executives treat their out-of-town clients to; when the philandering Fred MacMurray tells his suburbanite wife over the telephone that he’s got to stay in town for the evening to take a client to dinner and a show and she asks which one he replies, “Music Man — what else?” Billy Wilder and I.A.L. Diamond knew that not just New York audiences but the rest of America would get the joke.\n\nAgainst the odds, Warner Bros. did right by The Music Man when it came to make the movie adaptation. As usual, Jack Warner sought above-the-title star power and offered the role of the phony band salesman Harold Hill to James Cagney, Bing Crosby, Cary Grant (whom he would later court, equally fruitlessly, for My Fair Lady) and Frank Sinatra. Willson, fortunately, had contractual cast approval, so Preston, an “overnight success” after nearly 20 years of playing villains in forgettable movies, got the job, and an eventual Academy Award nomination as Best Actor in 1962. Barbara Cook, however, probably never stood a chance. She was short, and not conventionally pretty, certainly not in the accepted 1950s/early 1960s mode, and she’d already lost out on the movies of Oklahoma! (she was Laurie in the 1951 City Center Revival) and Carousel (Carrie Pipperidge in 1954, also at City Center). In her second live Carnegie album, in 1981, Cook performed a song by Wally Harper and David Zippel called “The Ingenue” in which she brought down the house when she sang this somewhat unwieldy lyric, which held a killer joke:\n\nThe parts for boys you play against\n\nThey bring out all the clones to do\n\nAnd movie roles you live to play\n\nThey give to Shirley Jones to do…\n\nJesting apart, I like Shirley Jones, and I especially like her in this movie. Her recent Oscar as Best Supporting Actress for playing the vengeful whore in the 1960 Elmer Gantry probably helped her with Warner, but if she hadn’t played Marion it’s hard to imagine who else could have, at least without extensive dubbing, always a drawback in a musical. Julie Andrews could have done it nicely (albeit with a British accent) but she was not yet a name in Hollywood and Doris Day, who was, didn’t have the vocal range. Day also strikes me as too contemporary in her basic persona. Her style with humor was dry when not shrill, and despite her sideshow virgin reputation, it’s hard to imagine her as innocent as Marion needs to be. Not that the character is a dummy: Marion is rightly suspicious of “Professor” Hill from the beginning, and even when she falls for him she knows he isn’t what he professes, I word I choose with care. She alone has the sense to see how Hill has improved the tenure and the texture of life in River City, and to shame the townspeople into admitting it. Jones locates the loneliness and yearning in Marion’s personality that hides below the moral rectitude that keeps her aloof from others and probably contributes to their narrow-minded distrust of her. There are two wonderful moments in Jones’ performance that confirm the warmth Marion conceals from others, and both take place during the extended “Marion the Librarian” dance — really a ballet designed to show not just how seductive Hill can be but how fulsome Marion’s latent womanliness is when she gives it release. The first is the way, when Hill croons to her those lines of the release that begin, “Now in the moonlight…” and the strings and horns shimmer in counterpoint Jones looks up at Preston with wide-eyed, romantic longing before she catches herself and retreats back into the starchy “No!” with which she cloaks herself. The second is when she eventually joins in the high school boys’ dance, climbing up onto a library table and smiling with the joy of giving in to an impulse that isn’t merely academic or (as her mother accuses her in “The Piano Lesson”) a part of that self-constructed persona in which she’s wrapped herself, a concoction of her “Irish imagination, [her] Iowa stubbornness and [her] liberry full of books!”\n\nRobert Preston was not an actor who, prior to December 1957, anyone thought of for musical comedy. Not a singer in the usual sense, he was exceptionally gifted at the sort of musical expression Willson was creating with his Music Man score. (Preston could sustain a note, but he was an actor primarily.) I don’t think there had ever been, as the star of a musical on Broadway, a performer quite like Preston before, and Harold Hill fit him like a bespoke suit. Hill (and by extension, Preston-as-Hill) is brash, self-assured, witty in the sense both of humor and of being wily, and endlessly adaptable; a supremely confident swindler — and “confidence” after all is the root of “con-man”: The moment Hill is challenged, by anything and anyone, he shifts into a line of blarney carefully designed to flatter his adversary, and generally does. Only when he hasn’t done what would now be called his “due diligence,” as when he fails to identify the pool-hall against which he inveighs in “Trouble” and “76 Trombones” as belonging to the Mayor and one of his unwitting agents, the teenage Zaneeta, is the daughter of the Mayor, does he run into turbulence. And even that doesn’t slow him down much. As with Harrison in the movie of My Fair Lady, Preston had played his role hundreds of times yet there is nothing studied about what he does on film. He seems as fresh as I imagine he did on opening night at the Majestic Theatre. His ebullience fairly explodes from the screen and if you can imagine anyone else in the part you still might be hard-pressed to imagine that performer being better at it.\n\nWhen I say that Warners did right by the play, as they would later do with My Fair Lady, I mean the studio respected the material enough to replicate it more or less intact, something that seldom happened with Broadway transfers, which when adapted to film were routinely shorn of half their musical numbers, even for scores and shows as venerated as The King and I. Probably these truncations were due to concerns about theater-owners not wishing to book long movies that caused them to lose daily screenings. (Warners in the 1950s, by contrast, produced remarkably faithful movies of The Pajama Game and Damn Yankees.) Marion Hargrove, credited with the Music Man screenplay, altered very little of Willson and Lacey’s book aside from substituting the ludicrous “great honk” for young Tommy Djilas’ “blasphemous” euphemism “jeely kly” and breaking up some of the dialogue, such as that between Hill and his former protégé Marcellus, into different scenes. Hargreaves’ one deathless contribution was in introducing Hill earlier than the play does — or at any rate, introducing his voice, since he remains anonymous and all we see of him is his back and a bit of his face in quarter-profile — and giving him a classic line (if indeed it was hers) in response to one of the salesmen on the train with whom he is playing cards:\n\nSalesman: How far you goin’, friend?\n\nHill: Wherever the people are as green as the money… friend.\n\nIt’s notable that, as he says the words, Preston is waving the wad of cash Hill has just won from the others — presumably, for all their collective cynicism, suckers all.\n\nJack Warner, perhaps wishing to preserve what made the show special, even hired the director of the Broadway production. Morton DaCosta. (It certainly didn’t hurt that DaCosta’s debut in film, also at Warner’s, the 1958 movie of Auntie Mame, which he’d also directed on stage, was the second highest-grossing picture of its year.) DaCosta developed an odd habit on his previous movie, of emphasizing its source’s theatricality by blacking out everything around the central actors at the end of a scene, putting a literal spotlight on them (usually in the person of Rosalind Russel), then fading out. He does this twice in The Music Man, once at the end of the first half and a second time when the River City School Board members played by the Buffalo Bills quartet perform the faux-barbershop number “Lyda Rose” in counterpart to Marion singing “Will I Ever Tell You?” on the front porch of her home. Split-screen might have worked as well but I have to admit that the stage-lighting solution, while born of live-theatre stagecraft, focuses our attention on the singers in a curiously successful fashion; as good stage directors know, a spotlight can be the theatrical equivalent of a close-up. (Although, conversely, a spotlight in a movie is not necessarily used in a close-up.) The picture as a whole has an overall artificiality, since most of it was shot on sound-stages and the open sets of River City (in “Iowa Stubborn” and the “76 Trombones” reprise at the end) were likely filmed on the Warners back-lot. Yet somehow the thing works, even when, in the finale, the drab, faded, ill-fitting band uniforms on the kids turn, magically, into gleaming new costumes; DaCosta & Co. seem in this moment to acknowledge the unreality of the material and to wholly embrace its fantasy.\n\nDaCosta also had an eye for the Technirama widescreen canvas, and how to frame his images within it. Auntie Mame was in widescreen too, but possibly because most of its sequences are set in interior spaces, it never feels as expansive as The Music Man. (The 2:40:1 aspect ratio is enormous, and must have been spectacular on a big movie theater screen.) I only have two additional criticisms to levy at DaCosta. The first is the unnecessary presence of Monique Vermont as Amaryllis in Marcellus’ stable when Hill is singing “The Sadder-But-Wiser Girl,” and laughing and applauding at the finish. Since Harold Hill is not only singing of adult matters but revealing something of himself that might seem unsavory (although it at least suggests he does not take advantage of unworldly virgins) why is a 10 year-old child eavesdropping on him? The second directorial instance (actually two, since the device is repeated) of editorial misstep is something I’m not sure he was responsible for: The numbing literal-mindedness of the moments in “Rock Island” in which as the salesman’s lyrics imitate the movement of a train there are cuts to the steam locomotive’s smokestack or its wheels and the corresponding, and equally annoying, cuts, during and just before “Pickalittle,” to actual hens pecking at the ground. Someone — whether it was Jack Warner, Morton DaCosta, a department head or a nameless committee of “experts” at the studio — didn’t trust moviegoers to get what hundreds of thousands of theatre audiences across the country, on Broadway and along the touring route, instinctively understood. Whoever’s dumb idea it was, these inserts are so literal they land with a thud every time they’re indulged. This should serve as a reminder, if one is needed, that the people who run movie studios think the rest of us are boobs.\n\nSpeaking of “Rock Island”: I had somehow forgotten that the main salesman in the number, who performs most of the lyrics, was Max Showalter. How I could have mistaken that distinctive, raspy voice of his for anyone else, I don’t know. Alert eyes and ears, however, can never misidentify the actor playing the train’s conductor: Percy Helton of the perennial man-boy voice. (In my more perverse fantasies I imagine a production of Waiting for Godot starring Helton and John Fiedler as Estragon and Vladimir, with Eric Blore as Pozzo and Rondo Hatton as Lucky.)\n\nIt is, by the way, over 400 miles from Brighton, Illinois, where the picture begins, and Mason City, Iowa, the real-life River City, yet the train journey in the movie takes only the time necessary for the salesmen to perform a truncated version of “Rock Island.”\n\nWhen I staged-managed that production of The Music Man in 1979 I consoled several student actors who were disappointed in not getting cast as either Harold Hill or Marion (we all wanted to be Harold Hill or Marion)* by assuring these friends that the supporting characters they got cast as would be the most memorable in the show. Although I counseled them thus largely because our Harold and Marion lacked a certain… shall we say dynamic interest?… as actors, I also knew how well those other characters were written: Mayor Shinn, his wife Eulalie Mackechnie Shinn, Mrs. Paroo, Winthrop, Charlie Cowell the anvil salesman, Tommy Djilas, Zaneeta Shinn — these aren’t just the then-standard “second lead ” or “secondary couple” figures of a muscial-comedy; they were and are exceptionally rich, and funny, supporting characters for any musical or even for any comic play. (David Burns, the original Mayor Shinn, took home a Tony Award for his non-singing performance and, I would argue, for the role itself.) Willson remembered the “types” of his Mason City childhood and, with Franklin Lacey, expanded them into marvelous comedic archetypes who burst the seams of the book and explode into often dazzling comic life. Example: In addition to Hermione Gingold’s hilariously ignorant and imperious, yet somehow enormously likable, Mrs. Shinn, the other ladies of her mobile kaffeeklatsch: The ever-treasurable Mary Wickes (Mrs. Squires), roly-poly Peggy Mondo (Ethel Toffelmier), prim Sara Seegar (Maud Dunlop), the eminently perturbable Jesslyn Fax (Avis Grubb) and, especially, Adnia Rice who as the morally outraged Alma Hix gets center position in “Pickalittle, Talkalittle” (“Oh, yes, that woman made… Brazen overtures/With a gilt-edged guarantee!”) One of the few regrettable trims from stage to movie is the loss of the Second Act “Pickalittle” reprise in which the ladies extol their newly-acquired love of those self-same “dirty books” they earlier inveighed against Marion for advocating, without which we are robbed of the delicious sight and sound of Gingold holding up a library volume and grinning, “Bal-zac!”\n\nMarcellus is less interesting, being essentially little but a stooge for Hill, although Buddy Hackett (of all people) does a fine job with it, but the cheerfully malaprop-dropping stage-Irish Mrs. Paroo is warmly and amusingly enacted by the veteran Pert Kelton (she was in the stage show), Timmy Everett as Tommy Djilas and Susan Luckey as Zaneeta Shinn make a charmingly goofy comedic Romeo and Juliet (Zaneeta to the Mayor: “It’s Capulets like you make blood in the marketplace. Ye gods!”) and Everett is the finest dancer in the picture. The other chorus boys are as good as you’d expect in a big movie-musical but Everett is a real dancer; every move he makes, as Harold Hill might say, bespeaks that fact. Harry Hickox is both funny and a little frightening as Hill’s nemesis Charlie Cowell and little Ronny Howard is just about perfect as Winthrop. The character is supposed to be 10, and Howard was a small seven when The Music Man was filmed and a year into playing Opie on “The Andy Griffith Show” but there the similarity ends. Even at his young age Howard differentiates Winthrop Paroo from Opie Taylor, and although I hesitate to use an overused word, he is an adorable presence in the picture. When he sings those lisping solo lines in “The Wells-Fargo Wagon” you feel something akin to what his sister Marion feels at that moment.\n\nPride of place, however, goes — as it did every time he made an appearance on stage or television or in a movie — to Paul Ford. With Ford’s trademark booming, pompous voice and air of supreme self-importance masquerading as sanctimonious concern with the public weal, Mayor Shinn becomes the embodiment of the perennial office-holder constantly on the alert ere he reveal something of his actual self or speak a word that can’t be deemed a true-blue, rock-ribbed endorsement of the status quo. It’s Shinn who changes the least throughout the action of The Music Man, yet you know he will ride Hill’s ultimate success for the rest of his political life.\n\nThe bright, rich Technirama color photography was the work of Robert Burks, among whose pictures are Rear Window, The Trouble with Harry, The Spirit of St. Louis, Vertigo and North by Northwest . The splendid period costumes were Dorothy Jeakins’, the equally fulsome art direction was by Paul Groesse and the rococo-Americana set decoration was George James Hopkins’. Don Walker, who was one of Broadway’s finest orchestrators (he did the originals for Carousel, Finian’s Rainbow, The Pajama Game, Fiddler on the Roof, She Loves Me, Anyone Can Whistle, Cabaret, Zorba, The Rothschilds and 70, Girls, 70) performed a splendid job with the stage Music Man, and Frank Comstock and Gus Levine did comparable work setting the songs for the movie, including adding a distinctive ocarina solo for “Wells Fargo.” I’m especially taken with the way they adapted the “Marion the Librarian” ballet music, as I am of Onna White’s choreography for it, and for the short, vigorous cakewalk Preston and Jones execute during the “Shiopoopi” dance. (The venerable Ray Heindorf was the supervisor, and conducted the Warners studio orchestra.)\n\nOf equal importance, especially for a musical, was the contribution of the picture’s sound recordist, George Groves. Groves was the recording engineer for The Jazz Singer in 1927, and worked his magic at Warners for 46 years. I don’t know to what extent he is responsible for the unparalleled clarity of Warner soundtracks, but I have always been struck by the sound of Warner Bros. movies and cartoons, where a gunshot doesn’t just sound like a gunshot but like a Warners gunshot: It’s an explosion of sound. In most movies musicals there is a distinct difference between the ambient sound recorded on the soundstage and the softer, more controlled sound of the singing, recorded in a studio. In The Music Man, there’s no difference, as there is also no difference — at least as I remember things from my last viewings of them, years ago — in The Pajama Game and Damn Yankees. It’s as if everyone was recorded singing on the set, a thing which after the early talkies rarely happened in movies. (The most notable exceptions are Rex Harrison’s vocals in My Fair Lady, recorded live because he either couldn’t lip-sync, or refused to.) In any case, The Music Man sounds as good as it looks.\n\nWhat really sells the show, however, and the movie, is a more benign version of the thing Harold Hill employs, disingenuously, to sell his band instruments and uniforms — an essential sunniness that courts but never tips into obviousness or sentimentality. Willson wrote his people with a rare generosity of spirit, even when they’re at their most gullible or naïve. Maybe it took a Broadway outsider to eschew the cynicism at the heart of most slick, satirical shows, and perhaps that elision, rare in a non-Rodgers-and-Hammerstein, as much as his glorious, idiosyncratic music and lyrics, was what even (to use my friend Eliot M. Camarena’s phrase) jaded Noo Yawkers of 1958 took to their hearts. Mayor Shinn, constantly upbraiding the newly amiable (and constantly barbershop-singing) members of the School Board to get Hill to show them proof of his academic and professional standing at one point barks at them to “get that spellbinder’s credentials!” The real spellbinder of The Music Man, however, wasn’t Hill. It was Meredith Willson.\n\n*My compensation for not playing Harold Hill, although I didn’t know it at the start, was being assigned the role of stage manager by a very canny director. It was the beginning of a love-affair with the position which, while brief, was intense and, even better, fun.\n\nText (aside from Meredith Willson’s and David Zippel’s lyrics) copyright 2024 by Scott Ross\n\nAs ever, click on the highlighted links for complete reviews (&cet.)\n\nBy Scott Ross\n\nSaboteur (1942) Although several of Alfred Hitchcock’s British movies (The Man Who Knew Too Much, The 39 Steps, Secret Agent, Sabotage, The Lady Vanishes) had glanced off the growing international tensions of the 1930s, and the 1940 Foreign Correspondent anticipated Britain and America’s involvement in what would later be called the Second World War, Saboteur was the first of his pictures to deal expressly with the war itself. (Lifeboat would follow, two years later.) Despite its overall air suggesting Office of War Information-directed propaganda and (as a result) occasionally stilted dialogue, Saboteur is a tight, entertaining thriller but from which, unfortunately, its maker borrowed too much from his earlier work, particularly The 39 Steps. The picture is predicated on the Wrong Man scenario: Barry Kane (Robert Cummings), a defense factory employee, is accused of murdering his best friend in an act of explosive industrial sabotage at an airplane factory and is forced underground to prove his innocence and catch the killer. Borrowings from The 39 Steps include the hero’s being handcuffed for much of the action; the suave villain (Otto Kruger) who reveals his complicity to Kane the way Godfrey Tearle tips Robert Donat off, both men convinced they are safe to do so; and the presence in the narrative of a blond woman (Madeline Carroll there, Priscilla Lane here) with whom against her will the innocent man becomes involved and who first tries to betray him to the authorities before joining his cause. There’s also in each picture a sequence set in a crowded theater (the Palladium in The 39 Steps, Radio City Music Hall in Saboteur) and in which gunshots factor. The terrifying Statue of Liberty climax in Saboteur, however, owes nothing to any of Hitchcock’s previous work, even if the villain’s fall is unconvincing by dint of the actor (Norman Lloyd) holding one arm out stiffly as he plummets to his death. In the main, though, the sequence is good Hitchcock. Bad Hitchcock is exemplified by the mistimed explosion at the battleship, depicted largely by the camera raising the shocked faces of the spectators, as if to suggest without showing it that they are being flung into the air. It’s one of those terrible, entirely unpersuasive ideas that permeate the director’s filmography and that you wish someone, perhaps his wife Alma, had talked him out of.\n\nThe picture was cleverly written (Peter Viertel, Joan Harrison and Dorothy Parker were the credited scenarists), beautifully shot by Joseph A. Valentine, and Cummings is better than you might expect as the hero. There is a charming sequence in the wagon of a community of circus freaks in which Pedro de Cordoba as the living skeleton and Anita Sharp-Bolster as the bearded lady give lovely performances, and Lane provides an engaging account of the emotionally mercurial young woman. Although his character virtually defines the phrase “too good to be true,” Vaughan Glazer as her blind uncle is an annealing presence and his forest cottage a serene refuge from the chase — he, and it, are a bit like enchanted figures in a fairy-tale who assist the besieged children fleeing the witch on their trail. As the wily titular character, Lloyd gives what I have always regarded as a very strange performance; he either underplays or overplays his reactions, and he reads lines not as if he was unaccustomed to speaking English but unaccustomed to speaking at all. Even the way he walks is odd. Many people love Lloyd in the picture, however, so take my reaction to him as a minority opinion.\n\nBrother, Can You Spare a Dime? (1975) Philippe Mora’s Depression documentary, sans narration but bursting with clips from period newsreels and Hollywood movies, in which Mora posits James Cagney as America’s representative figure, and Franklin Roosevelt as Everyman’s (and -woman’s) personal savior. The FDR hagiography is more than a little thick (the picture all but canonizes him as Saint Franklin) but I will admit that nowhere else have I seen sound footage of Giuseppe Zangara, his attempted assassin, or a striking shot of a naked Gary Cooper emerging from his swimming pool. The more familiar moments, such as the young Orson Welles looking spooked at his press conference the morning after the “War of the Worlds” radio broadcast and Walt Disney being given one large Academy Award and seven little ones by a gushing Shirley Temple for Snow White, are always a pleasure to see again, as are the numerous excerpts from Cagney’s pictures and the clips from King Kong, I Am a Fugitive from a Chain Gang, Citizen Kane, The Roaring Twenties, Wild Boys of the Road (that excruciating moment when the train runs over young Edwin Phillips’ legs), the young Fayard and Harold Nicholas dancing up a storm, and Walter Huston in the little-seen or remembered Capra-directed American Madness. There is also an except from a statement by the actress Betty Compson that is the last word in narcissistic ballyhoo, at least before the TikTok age. The music, as may be imagined of a documentary about the 1930s, is rich and varied and includes recordings and appearances by Paul Robeson, Bing Crosby, Al Jolson, The Andrews (but, alas, not the far superior Boswell) Sisters, Benny Goodman and, especially, Cab Calloway singing “Smokey Joe” while demonstrating the fluid moves the Fleischer brothers immortalized in their Betty Boop cartoons — and Michael Jackson later imitate. Some effective clips, such as Joan Blondell singing (in Etta Moten’s voice) the searing, “Brother”-derived “Remember My Forgotten Man” in Gold Diggers of 1933, might have been made more potent by better juxtaposition with the otherwise effectual newsreel footage of Douglas MacArthur leading the brutal destruction of the 1932 “Bonus Army” camp, a betrayal on top of a betrayal and one of the darker marks against Herbert Hoover’s administration. (Those armed thugs were so blood-thirsty you’d almost think they’d been trained, as our current police squads are, by the IDF.) That Warner Bros. permitted a number as frankly left-wing as “Remember My Forgotten Man,” and as implicitly critical of Hoover, even after his term in office was over, in one of its otherwise escapist musical extravaganzas, is illustrative: No other movie studio would have gone near it; the Warners reveled in it. There’s also a telling bit of film showing Cecil B. DeMille barking at his cast and crew that I imagine, to him, showed his command but to anyone else depicted a megalomaniac and professional martinet.\n\nWhile the Hollywood film clips are enjoyable, the most pointed bits involve the social and political history of the Depression: Of Eleanor Roosevelt speaking; Huey Long addressing Congress (and getting laughs Jack Benny might have envied); half-dead looking boys and girls in the dance marathons whose desperation was immortalized by Horace McCoy in They Shoot Horses, Don’t They?; a minister who admits to a camera interviewer that he has just voted Socialist; the many talking heads clearly either reciting memorized texts or reading from cue cards; Bessie Smith’s voice heard singing over newsreel film of floods*; apocalyptic views of the Dust Bowl accompanied by a recording of “Nobody Knows You When You’re Down and Out”; the faces of poor children, and of black Americans in the streets, looking painfully bewildered by what has happened to them; John Dillinger’s body in the morgue and, after his killing, his articulate father John Wilson Dillinger; Humphrey Bogart in the 1937 Black Legion joining a fictionalized edition of the Ku Klux Klan, and surreptitious film of the actual Klan in action; young hepcats Jitterbugging; the New York premiere of Citizen Kane; brief glimpses of Winston Churchill, sanctimoniously asking, “Aren’t we all going through hard times?” (as if you ever missed a meal, Winnie); Roosevelt’s doomed 1940 rival, whose name always makes me think of the Gremlin in the Bob Clampett-directed Bugs Bunny short Falling Hare shouting, “It ain’t Wendell Wilkie!”; paid thugs putting down food strikes (sound familiar?); and newsreel bits from the first and second match between the German symbol of Aryan supremacy Max Schmeling and the “Brown Bomber” Joe Louis. Their initial meeting, in 1936, was a humiliating defeat not merely for black America but for the nation as a whole. At their second, in 1938, Louis felt “the whole damned country was depending on me.” His victory gave everyone, white and black, but especially black, a reason to feel hopeful. While I personally deplore the blood-sport of boxing, sometimes a symbol transcends its origins, and Louis’ symbology had enormous power for positive national allusion.\n\nIn 1975, the footage in Brother, Can You Spare a Dime? of that self-righteous, puffed-up little bantam cock J, Edgar Hoover droning about his agency’s “conduct, intelligence and integrity” drew derision, especially from the young, many of whom had been betrayed in their own social, civil and antiwar movements by FBI spies posing as fellow-travelers.† Today these images would presumably be blown away by gales of knowing laughter… except perhaps from Democrats, who would doubtless fall into fainting swoons at the sight of one of their current heroes.\n\nLifeboat (1944) The second Hitchcock war-time thriller. Like the 1948 Rope it’s an experiment, but unlike that artificial, set-bound (and rather poorly acted) fiasco the limitations the filmmaker put on himself here don’t make the experiment a trial to sit through. Set, aside from some briefs views of ships either in distress or in a threatening position, in the lifeboat of an Allied craft bombed by a German submarine — which was itself destroyed in turn — the movie takes the time to give its characters weight and personality and relationships to one another. (Naturally, the black stevedore played by Canada Lee has fewer dimensions than the Caucasian characters, and tends more to stereotype, in this case of the subservient, conventionally Christian, doormat. And this is all the actor who played Bigger Thomas in Native Son under Orson Welles’ direction in New York could hope for in Hollywood.†) The story was written by John Steinbeck, whom in the wake of the success of John Ford and Nunnally Johnson’s adaptation of The Grapes of Wrath Fox was eager to exploit in its publicity. Unfortunately for Darryl Zanuck, Steinbeck loathed the completed movie and criticized it publicly and that, coupled with hostile press which, idiotically, argued that the picture glorified and ennobled the Nazi Superman played by Walter Slezak, made Lifeboat a flop in its time.\n\nConfining your action to a small boat on the high seas is an arresting notion, although the tank at 20th Century-Fox was a poor substitute for location work, and I’m afraid there’s never a moment in Lifeboat during which you are not aware of how essentially phony it all is. What matters, and what keeps the enterprise afloat in a dramatic sense are the relationships of the survivors huddled on that small skiff to each other and their interdependence for survival, and while they are largely by-the-numbers “types,” the often incisive and even witty screenplay by Jo Swerling, in which Ben Hecht also had an uncredited hand (he reportedly re-worked the ending) and whose strengths are emphasized, at one extreme by the soignée reporter played by Tallulah Bankhead and the wily industrialist portrayed by Henry Hull and, on the other, by Hume Cronyn’s telegraph operator, William Bendix as the gravely wounded prole, and the sadder-but-wiser girl played by Mary Anderson. The German U-Boat survivor they take in, and who is entirely and complacently convinced of his own Übermenschen status, is well played by Walter Slezak but in conception so silkily rotten it’s astounding that some of the picture’s commentators thought his character was being upheld by Hitchcock as a model. John Hodiak’s Red-leaning laborer, who spars with Bankhead before (naturally) they recognize their animal attraction to each other, is poised midway between flesh-and-blood and convenient social stereotype, although it seems to me that his natural snarling hostility toward the capitalist Hull is entirely and intelligently justified, and he hardly represented the “slurs against organized labor” Steinbeck perceived in him. Nor is Lee’s character the “stock comedy Negro” Steinbeck accused him of being, although he is embarrassingly servile and all-too-conventionally pious. Bankhead, essentially playing a variation on the public’s perception of her (and which she exploited ruthlessly for years afterward) comes off best, in part because she has the best lines but also because her character is slowly stripped of everything she values: Her camera, her documentary footage of the ship’s sinking, her typewriter, her fur and, eventually, the jeweled bracelet that represents to her how far she’s come from her proletarian beginnings, and what she’s had to pay for that ascension. It’s a neat (if perhaps a shade too neat) device and ultimately renders her more than a comic technical contrivance. The savagery of the climax, however justifiable, is disturbing, and was meant to disturb, although I suspect the Zionist Hecht disposed of Slezak’s Nazi with a certain amount of joy.\n\nI close with this anecdote concerning Lifeboat‘s lack of a musical score aside from the opening and closing credit sequences: Hitchcock thought the idea of a more conventional score in a picture about people stranded at sea risible, asking, “Where would the orchestra come from?” to which his composer, Hugo Friedhofer, astutely replied, “Where would the cameras come from?” Hitchcock sounded like one of those producers of early talkies who insisted there could be no music except in performance because otherwise the audience would wonder where the musicians were hiding. You’d think by 1944 someone as accomplished as Hitchcock would know better; more, you’d think such ideas would have long since been laughed out of existence.\n\nRascal (1969) Another Disney literary adaptation that, like the 1964 Those Calloways, suffers greatly by comparison with its source. Sterling North’s somewhat fictionalized Rascal: A Memoir of a Better Era is a book necessarily filled with the quiet pleasures of an early 20th century Wisconsin boyhood and which holds the sort of charm and enchantment of the best stories about children and animals. Someone at Disney — possibly the producer, James Algar — decided that North’s gentle story needed a dose of slapstick, overly-sentimental plot complications and even the presence of a friendly/meddling minister with a lisp-producing overbite getting quietly sloshed on fermented juice. Since Algar wrote another, much more effective and enjoyable, Disney adaptation (of Sheila Burnford’s The Incredible Journey) which eschewed such unnecessary interpolations, I can’t imagine why anyone thought material as good as North’s needed them. I don’t mind so much that Sterling’s age was raised since he’s played by the engaging Bill Mumy (he’s 11 in the book and Mumy was 14 when the movie was filmed) but little else that was changed is an improvement on the original. I very much appreciated Walter Pidgeon’s voice, narrating as the older North, and the lovely cinematography by William E. Snyder, and the art direction (John B. Mansbridge), set decoration (Emile Kuri and Frank R. McKelvy) and period costumes (Rosemary O’Dell) seem to me just about perfect as evocations of their time and place. Still, it’s telling to me that I recalled a mere three moments from Rascal, which I first saw on its initial release, and only one of those came from Sterling North’s book.\n\nSkin Deep (1989) It’s too bad John Ritter made such a success on television, especially in that smarmy 1970s sitcom of his, that it robbed him of a certain level of movie stardom, particularly in high comedy and slapstick, at both of which he was a master. (Surely Ritter was a greater comedian than, say, Chevy Chase, whose career went on well beyond anyone’s ability to comprehend how it happened, or why.) Oddly, very few makers of comedy saw how good he was. Peter Bogdanovich, who considered Ritter for Sonny in The Last Picture Show and would like to have cast him as one of the two leads in his Nickelodeon, used him in a smaller role in that and later gave him larger ones in They All Laughed and his very funny adaptation of the Michael Frayn stage farce Noises Off; he saw Ritter’s potential in movies early on, but almost no one else did. Ritter, with his verbal abilities and his insouciant brilliance at vigorous physical humor, seemed a natural for Blake Edwards, and this late-’80s sex-comedy is a good vehicle for what both did so well. In addition to his intelligence as a writer of dialogue, Edwards’ gifts as a framer of action are on view (the beautiful color photography is by Isidore Mankofsky) and there is a sequence involving glow-in-the-dark condoms, achieved through a combination of black screen and imaginative animation, that is riotously funny.\n\nRitter’s character, the writer Zach Hutton, is spiritual cousin to Dudley Moore’s in Edwards’ “10” and Burt Reynolds’ in the writer-director’s American version of the Truffaut Man Who Loved Women: Men who in these post-“MeToo” times, would doubtless be considered unforgivably “rapey” but who genuinely like and admire women even as they’re hopeful of bedding them. (When women are honest they often admit to similar feelings about the men to whom they are attracted, but just making that observation probably puts me beyond the pale.) We may regard Zach as compulsive, perhaps even priapistic, and still find him charming and witty, as we wait for the inevitable change to take place in the final reel. Like Ritter vis-à-vis Dudley Moore, Vincent Gardenia’s barkeep calls to mind Brian Dennehy’s “10” coeval at the resort hotel, serving as father-confessor, unpaid advisor and verbal sparring-partner, and his dialogues with Ritter remind the viewer of both how witty Blake Edwards could be, and how appealing Gardenia was. Alyson Reed is enormously engaging as Zach’s ex-wife (neither of them can live either with our without the other), Nina Foch has a fine late-career role as Reed’s mother and Michael Kidd is terribly funny as Zach’s half-cynical, half-confused psychiatrist, but as played by Bo Foxworth the role of Reed’s allegedly heterosexual college-age son is no more convincing than he’d have been had Matt Lattanzi or Jake Gyllenhaal been cast in it.\n\nOur Relations (1936) Last month in my remarks about The Bohemian Girl I observed that too many of Laurel and Hardy’s features make the team the victims of overly-deliberate pace. Then, lo and behold! I encountered this pearl of a comedy, which I had somehow never seen before. Although the opening third, in which two sets of identical Stans and Ollies (and the wives of one pair) are set up, is leisurely, once the action begins it doesn’t slow down for a moment, except to allow us to savor an especially funny bit or exchange of clever dialogue. The director, Harry Lachman, keeps up a screwball pace and the screenplay by Felix Adler and Richard Connell is filled with wonderful situations and some gloriously dizzy verbal humor. Perhaps the picture’s having been based on a short story (“The Money Box,” by William Wymark Jacobs, adapted by Jack Jevne and Charley Rogers) made a difference, or maybe it was Stan’s position as the official producer. I don’t know, but whatever it was, after seeing it I revised my contention that Way Out West and Sons of the Desert are the team’s best features and have added Our Relations to that short-list. Nearly everything about it works, from the long-lost-brothers/mistaken-identity plot, the crisp black-and-white cinematography by Rudolph Maté and Bert Jordan’s kinetic editing to the terrific supporting cast. This includes Alan Hale (Sr.) as a surly innkeeper, Sidney Toler (the future Charlie Chan) as the sailor set of Laurel and Hardys’ dyspeptic Navy Captain, Daphne Pollard as the landlubber Ollie’s easily-insulted wife, Betty Healy as Stan’s equally touchy helpmeet, Arthur Housman as a drunk (naturally), Iris Adrian and Lona Andre as a pair of mooching good-time girls and, supremely, James Finlayson as the sailor team’s nemesis. Although the Laurel and Hardy characters are essentially the same regardless of which twins they represent (Laurel is “Stan” and “Alf,” Hardy “Ollie” and “Bert”) their way with a comic line, a situation or a physical gag remains peerless, and there’s an equally hair-raising and uproarious sequence at the climax involving two sets of feet encased in pairs of concrete shoes careening wildly over a seaside dock that is (to 1936) the team’s funniest sequence since the pie-fight in The Battle of the Century.\n\nMeet Me in St. Louis (1944) is, I think, my favorite American movie about a happy family, and it seems more miraculous every time I see it. This portrait of the upper-middle-class Smiths from the summer of 1903 to the spring of 1904 and the opening of the St. Louis Exposition is intelligent, charming, wistful, engaging, poignant, expressive (and, during the Hallowe’en sequence, Expressionist), often very funny, and captures both the pains and pleasures of adolescence and as well the quotidian experience of a settled world poised delicately between the relative gentility of the 19th century and the coming hurly-burly of the 20th.\n\nThe Russians Are Coming! The Russians Are Coming! (1966) This adaptation by William Rose of the satirical Nathaniel Benchley novel The Off-Islanders is not only still surprisingly funny but also unsettlingly relevant, what with both Democrats and Republicans ratcheting up the seemingly unstoppable, Hillary Clinton-generated hysteria about the largest holder of nuclear weapons and Biden, Blinken and Sullivan — as unfunny a trio of stooges as ever fronted an American presidential administration"
