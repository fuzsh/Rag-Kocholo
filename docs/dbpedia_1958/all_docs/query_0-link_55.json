C.\n\nTO THE MEMORY OF MY PARENTS\n\nStephen Needham, Pugh\n\nand\n\nIsabel Forbes Pugh\n\nPREFACE\n\nTHE PURPOSE of this book is to depict life on the northeast side of the Pasquotank River as exemplified by the careers of certain individuals who have lived here during the past three centuries. The river was recognized as dividing Pasquotank County geographically into two separate areas long before the formation of Camden County in 1777. Even when this part of Carolina was known simply as the County of Albemarle and was under the supervision of the Governor of Virginia, land grants along the river carefully located themselves as being on “the northeast side” or “the southwest side.” This distinction lapsed into disuse only after the northeast region became Camden County and the description was therefore no longer necessary.\n\nThe scope of these narratives is limited to events of local import and to selected persons who have distinguished themselves while residents, except in four instances of unique significance to Camden. The history is not developed in the conventional manner, being confined to a series of informal biographical sketches which are in general chronologically arranged according to the death of the subject.\n\nAs a basis for determining the selection of individuals to be included, the following criteria were set up:\n\n(1) Those who preformed some outstanding deed or service.\n\n(2) Those who achieved prominence because of their association with some significant activity.\n\n(3) Those who left a permanent reminder of their presence.\n\n(4) Those who were typical of a class or group—one for each period of our history.\n\nThe first three of these objectives almost automatically pointed to those who should be chosen. The fourth standard presented difficulties since in any era there are obviously many people who may be regarded as typical of their times, and the inclusion of all such would not be practicable.\n\nThe aim has been to present these miniature biographies objectively. The pattern set by the chroniclers of the Bible has been taken as a guide to impartial presentation. In other words the intention has been to follow the well known directions spoken by Othello: “Nothing extenuate or aught set down in malice, but speak of me as I am.” And it is further hoped that these pages will serve not only as a source of useful information for those now living but also as a helpful\n\nstarting point for those who may wish to contribute additional data in the future.\n\nThe sources of the materials employed are listed separately for each biographical sketch. As may be noted, I have made frequent use of North Carolina, a History of a Southern State, by Hugh Talmage Lefler and Alfred Ray Newsome, a volume which helped me greatly to keep my subjects in their proper historical perspective and, as needed, supplied me with background information. I acknowledge with appreciation my indebtedness to the authors for the use of their history. Professor Lefler was also kind enough to read the sketches in manuscript and offer many practical suggestions, especially so to an amateur writer. I also wish to express my thanks to Dr. W. P. Jacocks of Chapel Hill for his encouragement and guidance in the preparation of this book.\n\nAll persons who have contributed information are listed in the Sources and to them I hereby wish to make known my gratitude. I should like especially to acknowledge my obligation to Dr. Elizabeth Gregory McPherson of the Library of Congress staff. She has cheerfully and tirelessly supplied valuable data from the great storehouse of materials in the Library. To Mrs. Jane Gregory McPherson my sincere thanks are due for her courtesy in relating many local traditions and items. I am also indebted to Mr. and Mrs. W. J. Burgess for their generous contributions of facts and folklore.\n\nMany individuals have assisted in the mechanical preparation of this book. The excellent map showing where the subjects of the bibliographies lived and also the miniature used between the sketches are the work of Mr. S. A. Tuten, Jr., Camden's County Agent, and I sincerely thank him therefore. I am greatly indebted to my niece, Mrs. J. H. Chapman (Faye Pugh) of Portsmouth, who volunteered to type the bulk of the manuscript. My thanks are also due to Mrs. Raymond Maxwell of Raleigh both for her assistance in copying materials as well as for her encouragement. I also wish to express my obligation to the following persons who typed the appendices: Mrs. H. R. Topping, Mr. E. Ray Etheridge and Rev. Carl Calloway, and I gratefully acknowledge my indebtedness to Mr. E. D. Fowler of The Seeman Printery, Durham, whose suggestions were most helpful in arranging the contents and in selecting a cover design. In fact, this book has been made possible through the generous efforts of others.\n\nJESSE FORBES PUGH\n\nOld Trap.\n\nJuly 10, 1957\n\nCONTENTS\n\nPrefaceviiEarl of CamdenPortrait and sketchfacing page 3George FlemingAn Early Settler3William JenningsAn Early Prison5Paul LathamFirst Clerk of the Court8John PhilpottA Tragedy10William RaymondAn Ancient Place-Name13Cornelius JonesThe Genial Mariner15John NortonAn Indian Fighter18John DansonThe Beginning of Shiloh21William JoyA Permanent Name24Thomas BarecockAncestor to Many26Robert MorganHost to the Provincial Assembly28William ReedActing Governor30Ann JonesSite of an Ancient Meeting House33Gabriel BurnhamLeader in North End of the County35Samuel WilliamsA Colonial Planter37McRora ScarboroughAn Aristocrat39John SolleyAn Important Ferry43Caleb SawyerFirst Attempt to form the County45Thomas HunterBuilding a Watermill47William BurgessFounder of Shiloh Baptist Church50John BurgessA Burning Light53Griffith JonesA Rowdy Leader55Samuel LowmanThree Captains of the Colonial Militia58Josiah NashNehemiah JonesJohn OggsThe Race Problem62Thomas WrightIshmael64John ForbesDulce et Decorum67Gideon LambA Gallant Father and His Son70Abner LambLemuel Sawyer, Sr.High Sheriff in Two Counties75Abner HarrisonA Confiscation Commissioner77John GrayCamden's First Representatives79Caleb GrandyThomas Humphries\n\nHenry AbbottPreacher and Patriot83Hezekiah LintonA Patriotic Family87Jehu LintonJesse LintonSilas LintonSelby HarneyKnight-Errant89Isaac GregoryThe Master of Fairfield Plantation92Dempsey BurgessFirst Congressman from Camden97Joseph JonesThe Formation of Camden County101Peter DaugeAn Industrious Soldier106Amy Burfoot, Sr.Mother and Daughter109Amy Burfoot, Jr.Benjamin JonesThe Dismal Swamp Canal112Peter MercerThe Innkeeper114Frances, Marchioness CamdenPortrait and sketchfacing page 118Elisha McBrideThe Coming of the Methodists118Arthur OldA Later Immigrant123James S.

His longest tenure was as Chief Justice of Common Pleas; after his elevation to the peerage in 1765 he was made Lord Chancellor. His defense of the cause of the colonies and his praise of their conduct during the Revolution won for him wide popularity in the United States. He once stated that he would have exchanged half of his fortune for the privilege of having been a member of the Congress which drew up the Declaration of Independence. In his opinion this gathering constituted “the most virtuous public body of men which ever had or ever would meet together in this world.” Many towns and counties in this country bear his name. The portrait is after one of Sir Joshua Reynolds. The black and silver of Lord Camden's coat of arms suggested the colors used in the covers of this book.\n\n• An Early Settler\n\nGEORGE FLEMING\n\nca 1635-1694\n\nNO ONE KNOWS who was the first settler on the northeast side of the Pasquotank River, but George Fleming was evidently one of the first to establish a residence there. For one thing, the waterway which has been known as Raymond's Creek for at least two hundred and fifty years was previously called Fleming's. “fflemins creek” is referred to in the Colonial Records as a boundary of a tract of land in a noted trial which took place during the same year in which this pioneer died.\n\nApparently he was living here when the Lords Proprietors received this territory in 1663 from Charles II and when they tried during the first years to replace the old Indian names with designations honoring themselves. Thus, Pasquotank River became “Craven River” and Currituck and Pasquotank (the latter included present day Camden) were formed into the Precinct of Carteret. Therefore one reads in the land grant books that a patent was issued in 1681 to one of Fleming's neighbors, “Isaac Gilford of Craven River,” for 100 acres “in Carteret Precinct on the riverside.” Happily, the vitality of the Indian names survived this attempt to obliterate them and they had reappeared officially when the County of Albemarle became the Province of North Carolina in 1689.\n\nBefore 1700 practically all settlers in the Albemarle area selected a site with water frontage, and Fleming was no exception to this practice. His house stood on one side of a small gut or slough issuing into a larger creek which was to bear his name; and his close friend, Simeon Rice, lived on the other side of the smaller stream. His dwelling probably approximated the dimensions of Rice's house, which were twelve by eighteen feet. The small window openings were without glass and were closed to the elements by wooden shutters, while the floors were “the good earth.” The exterior walls were covered with upright hand-rived boards and the roof with wood shingles of the same manufacture, the customary mode of building employed by the early settlers, especially those in the lower economic brackets. According to\n\ncontemporary descriptions, such a house was usually contained in an all-purpose room—kitchen, living room and bedroom.\n\nThere is no record of a patent issued to Fleming, who probably never received any documentary title to his small estate. Before the territory became the property of the Lords Proprietors, some of the newcomers effected a purchase of lands from the Indians but more often they simply moved in, cleared a few acres, erected a crude structure and, in their minds at least, acquired title “by right of possession.” Sometimes a grant would be obtained for a tract several years after it had been occupied by the grantee.\n\nFleming held no public office nor asserted himself in public affairs. He was typical of the majority of colonists who of necessity literally wrested a livelihood from the wilderness with their bare hands. To him the business of making a living often presented rather grim aspects, so exacting was the struggle for self-preservation. An axe, a gun, a hoe, an iron pot for cooking—such utilitarian items were tremendously valuable because they could not immediately be replaced and without them the hardships of frontier life were intensified. Having known privations, Fleming became acutely aware of the needs of his neighbors.\n\nHis will is a concrete expression of his desire to help those who lived about him, even though he had only meager possessions with which to express his sentiments. His bequests were: to Thomas Elliott, “my longest gun”; to James Robinson, “a cow and a calf”; to Henry Bray, “my best coate, briches, shirte, draweres and hatt”; and to his executor, Simeon Rice, “my loving friend,” he left the rest of his property should his daughter, an only child, die without issue.\n\nThat Fleming in turn enjoyed the friendly esteem of his neighbors of every degree is indicated by the witnesses to his will. There were four and they were: Elizabeth Jones, wife of Captain Cornelius Jones, prosperous merchant trader and representative in the Provincial Assembly; John Philpott, clerk of the court and man of affairs in the Albemarle; Isaac Gilford, a very substantial citizen; and William Bray, son of the William Bray who was deputy marshal for Currituck. Here too, perhaps, one may perceive how life in the wilderness fostered a feeling of common brotherhood, which is essentially a fundamental principle of democracy.\n\nWhy have certain place names disappeared, and why have others continued to remain? Whatever the reasons for this whim of history, the adjoining neighbors, George Fleming and Simeon Rice, afford an interesting illustration. As we have already noted, the larger creek\n\nfronting the two small farms was called “Fleming's.” Meanwhile, the little stream running between the two dwellings was named “Lydai's,” evidently for Rice's wife Lydai. Within ten years after Fleming's death, the larger creek became Raymond's and has been so designated to this day. Erosion transformed the narrow slough long ago into a swamp. Nothing is known of Lydai Rice except her name, but the small morass is still called Lydai's Creek.\n\n• An Early Prison\n\nWILLIAM JENNINGS\n\nca 1635-1687\n\nTHE FIRST YEARS following the transfer of the territory including North Carolina to the Lords Proprietors were characterized by weak government and continuous unrest, erupting at times into defiance and actual violence. William Jennings first appears in 1677 in one of the most spectacular episodes, the so-called Culpeper Rebellion, as the custodian of Thomas Miller, collector of customs and representative of the governor, and who had been imprisoned by the “rebels.” A brief explanation seems necessary to make clear the part played by Jennings.\n\nAlthough ineffectual administration under the Proprietors was a contributing factor, the basic reasons for dissatisfaction stemmed from two deep-seated causes originating before the Proprietors took over. In the first place, those early settlers who were substantial landowners generally resented the transfer of this territory from the Crown to the Proprietors. Since William Jennings aligned himself with this group, this may indicate residence here before the transfer, for although the records do not show when he arrived or how his property was acquired, he owned a sizable plantation.\n\nThe other basic reason for dissatisfaction, and shared by all classes of settlers, was the restrictive trade measures known as the Navigation Acts, which were enacted in 1651 and 1660 and required all colonial commerce to be carried in British, Irish or colonial vessels, and certain items, notably tobacco, could be shipped only to England. What was\n\nregarded as a further unnecessary restriction were the Plantation Acts of 1673 which permitted shipments to other colonies provided an additional duty was paid on the goods, for example, a penny per pound on tobacco, which had become the chief money crop. Many colonists felt that British subjects should have the same trade privileges regardless of their habitation. Consequently, flagrant and open violation of the Navigation and Plantation Acts became a common practice.\n\nThus it came to pass that Deputy Governor Peter Carteret, disheartened because of opposition to the enforcement of the Plantation Acts, resigned his post in 1673, leaving affairs of the colony in the hands of John Jenkins. Backed by influential George Durant and John Culpeper, Jenkins displayed no inclination to enforce the offensive statute. Support of enforcement was led by Thomas Eastchurch, Speaker of the Provinical Assembly, and Thomas Miller. In the tussle between the two factions Miller was thrown into jail, whereupon Eastchurch managed to depose Jenkins and also imprison him. Miller escaped and he and Eastchurch in London were able to obtain support of the Proprietors for their cause. Eastchurch was appointed governor and Miller, secretary and collector of customs. Stopping in the West Indies on the return trip, Eastchurch became attracted to a “woman of considerable fortune” and very practically “took hold of the opportunity” and married her. While he was consummating this pleasant diversion, he sent Miller on before to act as president of the council and to handle matters pending the governor's arrival.\n\nMiller arrived and forthwith set about with great zeal and little tact to enforce the hated laws and to collect the customs. He also meddled in precinct elections and in general comported himself in such a manner as to kindle burning wrath on the part of his opponents. The situation came to a head when Miller arrested Captain Zachariah Gillam, master of a trading vessel, for violation of the Navigation Acts. The opposition led by George Durant, John Culpeper, Valentine Byrd and others, surrounded Miller's house, captured him and threw him in prison.\n\nThis rebellion received favorable support from the people. The Provincial Assembly met and appointed a new council of state and Culpeper was chosen governor. Miller and others were tried and he was again imprisoned. Later, he again escaped from his jail and with Timothy Biggs went to London to present their cause before the Proprietors.\n\nIn London a complete investigation was ordered by the Privy Council. Several depositions were taken and the imprisonment of Miller was frequently referred to. For example, one Peter Brockwell testified that Miller was a “prisoner in Irons as he was to ye uppr end of Pasquotank River at one old Wm Jennings his house under a strong guard to whom none was admitted to speake except publiquely and a little while after ye Deponent saw ye sd Miller enclosed in a logg house about 10 or 11 foot square purposely built for him.” It is therefore clearly in evidence that Jennings sided with the “rebels” in the Culpeper Rebellion and that his house was used as a place of confinement for the leading figure in the conflict.\n\nThere were two reasons for using Jennings’ residence as a prison; no jails had been erected and the location was not readily accessible to sailing vessels. The house was quite probably on the outer edge of the settlements which had been made thus far and is not regarded today as “the upper end”—the description now refers to the head waters of the river in the vicinity of the modern village of South Mills. Incidentally, ownership of the Jennings plantation soon passed to the Murden family, and as “Murden's Landing” it was long one of the sites designated for the inspection of foreign commodities prior to the Revolution. The identity of its early use is revealed in a deed dated 1736, when Jeremiah Murden, Sr., gives to his son Jeremiah, Jr., the plantation “joyning on the mouth of Sawyers Creek and being commonly known as William Jennings Plantation.” The mouth of Sawyers Creek is about four miles above Elizabeth City or “the Narrows,” as the site was then known.\n\nJennings possessed a substantial plantation and owned both Negro and Indian slaves at the time of his death. His two guns, both valuable and necessary items in those days, were carefully bequeathed: to his son John, “my longest gun,” and to his son-in-law “Ralph Garrot, the gun as I bought of Captain Gillam.” Jennings was one of the most interesting of the early settlers who lived on the northeast side. With the exception of his grandson of the same name, however, the members of this family have generally dwelt on the southwest side of the river in what is now Pasquotank County from colonial times until the present.\n\n• First Clerk of the Court\n\nPAUL LATHAM\n\nca 1643-1693\n\nTHE DOCUMENTS which reveal Paul Latham as Clerk of the County of Albemarle in 1676 also recorded an interesting item of history in this region. The “County of Albemarle,” the first official designation of North Carolina, included the territory bordering on the ocean from Chowan River to the Virginia Line.\n\nThe second governor of Albemarle was Samuel Stephens who died in 1669. Stephens had acquired possession of Roanoke Island, which he bequeathed in entirety to his widow, the former Frances Culpeper. In 1670 she married Sir William Berkeley, governor of Virginia, and in 1676 he sold all of the island to Captain Joshua Lamb, a New England mariner. Lamb sold a one-half interest to one Nicholas Paige of Boston, who in turn devised this interest to his niece, Mrs. Martha Hobbs, who later married Nathaniel Oliver, also of Boston.\n\nThe records of the transactions having been destroyed or misplaced in the Albemarle, a question arose as to the legality of the Olivers’ title to the property. With characteristic foresight, however, the New Englanders had prudently had duplicate copies made of all the transactions. Thus, when a history of the several transactions was reviewed before the local courts, one of the supporting documents submitted was a deposition by John Culpeper that he had been a subscribing witness when Sir William Berkeley signed the deed of sale of Joshua Lamb on April 17, 1676. The deposition was made before Paul Latham, Clerk of the Albemarle County Court.\n\nBy an interesting coincidence Latham and Captain Joshua Lamb were referred to at a later date in connection with the subterfuges resorted to by the planters to avoid compliance with the requirements of the Navigation and Plantation Duty Acts. Many devices were employed by the planters to evade payment of any duties, especially on tobacco, their most profitable crop, and those stratagems were effected with the active cooperation of some of the New England traders. The following verbatim quotation from a deposition made by one Solomon Simmons in 1679 describes one of the methods: “This depont saith . . . he sawe sundry Hds Tobacco shipt by Josh & Caleb Lamb 2 New Engld traidrs from ye aforesd Crawford's Plantation undr ye motion of Bate as the said Lambs did afterwards publiquely owne and boast of.”\n\nObviously the shippers could not avoid payment of all duties and when they did pay they were permitted, in lieu of specie, to do so with an amount of tobacco equal in value to the duty levied. This gave rise to another sharp practice of meeting such obligations with tobacco of poor quality, the better grades being withheld for the trade. In a deposition made in 1679 Paul Latham stated in effect that one Captain Haron had protested taking on board a shipment to England of this inferior tobacco because it was unmarketable and was not worth the freight charges and, consequently, would “leave his owners in debt.” As attorney for Captain Haron, Latham added, he had made the suggestion to Robert Holden, Collector, not to send this tobacco that was “so bad” to England, but to permit Latham to see if he could “gett anything for it of ye New England men.” Evidently the enterprising New Englanders knew of markets where the customers were not too discriminating as to quality.\n\nHolden was obdurate, however, and insisted upon making the shipment despite the protests. Furthermore, according to complaints made during this period, Holden was performing his duties in a high-handed manner and refusing to cooperate with local officials. According to an existing document, the Comptroller of Customs and Surveyor-General of the province, Timothy Biggs, who by virtue of his office designated the places from which vessels should obtain clearance papers, wrote a letter to Holden reprimanding him for failing to recognize the comptroller's deputy, Samuel Pricklove, and for ignoring the comptroller's clearance orders. This letter, so the record affirms, was delivered to the collector at the residence of George Durant, February 4, 1679, in the presence of Colonel John Jenkins, Paul Latham, and others. True to form, Holden angrily declared he would have nothing to do with the bearer of the letter or with Biggs either.\n\nLatham was the first clerk of the court to reside on the northeast side of the river. He was clerk of the Albemarle Court in 1676 and again in 1692, although this latter term may have been restricted to duties in Pasquotank Precinct. The few surviving references to Paul Latham's career are sufficient to identify him as an active participant in various phases of the public life of his time. Thanks to an affidavit by the man who married his widow, we are informed of more personal details. His plantation was known as “Rich Thicket,” consisted of 150 acres and had been part of the estate belonging to John Philpott, who had sold him the tract. Since it is known that Philpott, who was to serve later as\n\nclerk, lived in the forks of Raymond's Creek, the approximate location of Latham's residence is therefore established.\n\n• A Tragedy\n\nJOHN PHILPOTT\n\nca 1630-1694\n\nONE OF THE TRAGIC figures who have lived on the northeast side of the Pasquotank River was John Philpott. After a long and respectable career with “honor and troops of friends” he came suddenly and dramatically to an ignominious end.\n\nMany instances can be cited to show that he must have had a wide acquaintance in the province. He was serving as clerk of the court in 1689 when the official designation of the County of Albemarle was changed to the Province of North Carolina, and he held the same office in 1693. His appearance at different places and with various persons seems to indicate an individual ubiquitous in his habits. We find him over in Perquimans as witness to the will of the pioneer leader, George Durant. With such widely scattered gentlemen as Thomas Jarvis, Thomas Pollock, Thomas Miller and Henderson Walker he was joint sponsor of an act making any persons liable to imprisonment without bail who “cast forth any opprobious language against any person . . . whereby to cause animosities and disaffection amongst any inhabitants of this County”—an effort made obviously to calm the public during the turbulent period following the ousting of Governor Seth Sothel. And over on the southwest side of the river when that wealthy Quaker, John Archdale, had in 1686 established his daughter Ann Archdale upon a thousand-acre tract, Philpott was prompt in submitting a written obligation to deliver pork. Incidentally, he was a merchant of consequence as evidenced by his accounts with those Bermuda merchants, Messrs. Duncombe and Robison.\n\nJohn Philpott was obstinate in his views and his occasional lawsuits may also denote a contentious disposition. Tenacity of opinion, however, may have been an ancestral trait, for either a direct or collateral\n\nancestor was that John Philpott who wrote a violent treatise against the Anabaptists, and who was continually engaged in controversy and was finally burned at the stake in 1555 as a heretic and Protestant martyr during the reign of Mary Tudor. The devotion of Philpott and William Bray, among others, to the Established Church may well explain why the Society of Friends was never able to gain any adherents in the Camden area while at the same time the Society increased rapidly in numbers on the Pasquotank side.\n\nA glance at one or two phases of contemporary history will serve to throw some light upon the mental state which the aging Philpott finally displayed. As will be recalled, James II was deposed in 1688 and his daughter Mary and her husband, William of Orange, were brought from Holland to occupy the English throne. Philpott had been loyal to James and, characteristically, was unwilling to accept the new sovereigns. He had little sympathy with the violence and lawless restlessness which culminated with the capture and imprisonment of Thomas Miller, and due to his influence, one suspects, no one in the populous Raymond's Creek community—where Philpott lived—took part in the so-called Culpeper Rebellion. In brief, he seems to have been a stickler for law and order and by temperament opposed to radical changes. And, too, the growing influence of the Quakers must have presented to him an alarming situation.\n\nWhatever the explanation, on the evening of September 9, 1694, he attended a gathering in the home of Major Alexander Lillington, “High Sheriff of Albemarle County,” who lived over in Perquimans Precinct. Quite likely the latest political gossip was the appointment of John Archdale to succeed Thomas Smith as Governor of North and South Carolina. The significance of this information stemmed from the fact that Archdale was a wealthy Quaker from England who had already spent some time in Pasquotank Precinct. The prospect of an administration under an adherent of the Society of Friends group was the last straw, it may be, which snapped the self-control of the disgruntled Philpott. At any rate, when a toast to King William was proposed, he not only refused to drink but cursed his sovereign with a mighty oath and declared, “I'le drink King James’ health for he is the right king.” The records state that upon being admonished by the company as to what he had said, he asked what had he said “in a most malicious manner”; and when his remarks were repeated to him, he roundly cursed King William again.\n\nPhilpott was charged with treason, tried at the November court and found guilty. The sentence imposed was forfeiture of all his possessions\n\nto the Crown and that he should “suffer imprisonment for one whole year and a day without bail.” Then the minutes state “and upon the humble peticon of ye sd Philpott and in comiseration of his weakness and age,” the court ordered the estate to be appraised, deductions made for expenses of the trial, and the remainder to be returned to said Philpott, “he giving good security and to render an acct of ye same to ye Grand Council.”\n\nDuring this period when another man was charged with verbal indiscretions, he offered as his excuse, “they were a drinking of clarett.” According to the court minutes the aged recalcitrant did not deign to offer any justification; in this respect he remained his stubborn self. Despite his conviction, however, he still stood high in public opinion as to his personal character; even with the shadow of public disgrace upon him, Thomas Relfe, Surveyor-General, and Daniel Akehurst, Secretary of the Council, came to witness his will.\n\nDeath followed his sentence quickly and mercifully, for he was dead when court convened again in the February following. Confiscation must have been thorough because his widow, Mary Philpott, petitioned the court to grant her “some apparel that are in ye custody of sd marshal.” With an air of generosity the justices ordered not only the return of her clothing but permitted her to choose “three sows with piggs.”\n\nAt the time of his death Philpott's residence was evidently on his plantation in the forks of Raymond's Creek. Later deeds reveal that at an early period one dwelling stood at the Fork Landing on the creek and one near a live oak, which still stands. Both of the structures disappeared long before the memory of any persons now living, but one of those houses could well have been Philpott's home. And across a little branch near the live oak careful scutiny will still reveal ballast stones placed there as grave markers centuries ago. Since this burial ground was on Philpott's lands, one of the crude stones may mark his grave. Incidentally, his will points to a product which had already become of commercial importance to the colonists hereabouts. To one of his devisees he leaves 6,000 pounds of pork with which to buy a Negro slave.\n\n• An Ancient Place-Name\n\nWILLIAM RAYMOND\n\nca 1660-1713\n\nSomewhat with a flourish one of the Raymonds identified himself as being a citizen of “Ye citie and Port of Dover in ye County of Kent, Kingdom of Great Brittaine.” Presumably, therefore, this information names the place from which the family originally came.\n\nWilliam Raymond appeared in the Province in the early 1690s at the beginning of an era of comparative stability in the public life of the colony. For more than a decade there had been controversy and violence, invited largely by the tactless efforts of Thomas Miller, collector of customs, and of Governor Seth Sothel to enforce the unpopular Navigation and Plantation Duty Acts. But under the administration of Phillip Ludwell, who followed Sothel, and continuing with his able and conscientious successors, Thomas Jarvis, Thomas Pollock and Henderson Walker, the Province experienced a restful period of efficient government such as had not heretofore been known under the administration of the Lords Proprietors.\n\nRaymond seems to have located on the northeast side prior to 1694 although his patent was not issued until 1696. He took up 450 acres covering an old grant to which the title had lapsed, and another small tract occupied by a squatter who had failed to secure legal title to his site. In 1681 one John Dye had obtained title by letters patent to a strip of land beginning at the mouth of a creek on “Craven River,” as Pasquotank River was designated for a brief period. Dye chose to settle on other properties in Perquimans Precinct and therefore failed to seat his holdings along the Pasquotank according to regulations prescribed under the Proprietors. “To seat” a property the grantee had to erect thereon a habitable dwelling and to clear and cultivate at least two acres of land within five years. Raymond could therefore lawfully gain possession of the abandoned Dye acreage, and he proceeded also to satisfy the claims of Simeon Rice, the man who was without title to the small farm on which he lived.\n\nEvidently this newcomer possessed means sufficient so that it was not necessary for his family to undergo the rugged privations endured by more destitute arrivals. Owning a few slaves, he was able at once to build a more comfortable habitation than most, construct a warehouse along the river for convenience in disposing of forest products from his\n\nacreage, and without too much delay was able to begin shipping tobacco, pork and other items. Moreover, since he was the type of citizen who was immediately recognized as an asset to the community about him, his family was accepted as a welcome addition to the neighborhood and his daughters began to marry among the local gentry.\n\nAssociated with William Raymond are three items of historical interest to the inhabitants of Camden County. First of all, one of our most ancient place-names derives from him. The creek upon which this planter located his plantation had previously been known as Fleming's but by 1700 the name of Raymond had been substituted therefor, and it has been in use from that time until the present.\n\nIn the second place, the Raymonds were just about the last to settle in what was probably our oldest settlement, whose origin is concealed in the dim beginnings of our early history. This community embraced present-day Old Trap and the lands bordering the conjunction of the Pasquotank River and the Albemarle Sound. We have already met such local leaders as Paul Latham and John Philpott. Here also lived for a period Philpott's friend and prominent colonial official, Daniel Akehurst, and such other substantial settlers as Joseph Gilford, Phillip Torksey, Cornelius Jones and Francis Delamere. Special mention should be made, it seems, of John Hawkins and his wife Sarah. Because of their blood ties with the Hawkins, Archdales and other noble families of England, these two could probably lay claim to the most patrician lineage of any couple who has lived within the borders of Camden. The site of their first local residence was southeast upon the modern village of Shiloh and they called it Wickham (or Wycombe), doubtless for Wycombe Abbey in England where were found the Archdale and Hawkins ancestral estates. But after the appearance of the Raymonds, John and Sarah Hawkins purchased and moved to the attractive Tommy's Point plantation along the river. With aristocratic disregard for their other neighbors roundabout they described their property simply as “being southeast upon the swamp called Raymond's.”\n\nAnother fact which protrudes itself to one who examines the materials of Raymond's career is the impressive stature of some of his descendants. Whether this be mere coincidence or whether it be illustrative of certain sociological aspects of the breed, the prospect is not without interest. If the statements of certain historians be accepted as authoritative, the following observations may be regarded as factual.\n\nWilliam Raymond's son Thomas and family returned to Dover in later years and the other son, Edward, emigrated to parts unknown. For illustrative purposes this account is limited to the descendants of\n\none only of the Raymond daughters, Elizabeth, and because her life is fairly well documented. She first married John Scarborough. Their daughter Sarah became the first wife of William Burgess, who founded Shiloh Baptist Church in 1729. From this union came two outstanding ministers of the colonial period, the brothers John and William Burgess. John was the father of Lieutenant Zephaniah Burgess and Colonel Dempsey Burgess of the Revolutionary era, the last named being a delegate to the Halifax and Hillsboro Conventions and afterwards a member of the Congress of the United States. Sarah Scarborough's sister Elizabeth married William Wright, and their descendants merged into the Stevens and Burfoot families, the latter being a paternal line of the late U. S. Senator Willis Smith. Elizabeth's second husband was —Smith (probably James), and there is some likelihood that through this union she became again a direct ancestress of Senator Smith and also of Congressman William Smith of South Carolina.\n\nRaymond's Creek is a continuous reminder of a family which made a lasting contribution to a vigorous citizenship in this county.\n\n• The Genial Mariner\n\nCAPTAIN CORNELIUS JONES\n\nca 1660-1714\n\nOVER IN CURRITUCK during the reign of Queen Anne, William Parker charged that Martha Richardson did “Devillishly and Maliciously Bewitch and by Assistance of ye Devill afflicted ye body of ye sd William Parker”; and in the same precinct a few days later Thomas Bourthier accused Susannah Evanes, “Not having the fear of God before her Eyes but being led by Instigation of the Devill,” of having bewitched “with Mortal paynes” his wife Deborah Bourthier “whereby the sd Deborah departed this life.” Both women were accused also of bewitching other persons who were not identified.\n\nWhen general court convened for the County of Albemarle, Cornelius Jones and fifteen other men in the province were impanelled to consider the charges of witchcraft against the two Currituck women. The jury deliberated and in both instances the verdict was “Wee of ye Jury find no Bill.” This firm action effectively controlled a situation\n\nwhich might easily have developed into an epidemic of “witch-hunting” such as had plagued Massachusetts. Since Cornelius Jones, a well-known merchant trader and representative from Pasquotank in the Provincial Assembly, and Robert Wallis, sometime member of the Council of State, were the most prominent members of the panel, a reasonable inference would seem to be that the verdict was influenced by their opinions.\n\nAttention is focussed on Jones because according to the few remaining records of this period he was often called for jury duty, which fact could indicate popular respect for his judgment. In any event, the juries of which he was a member did not habitually return verdicts of acquittal. For an instance, when Mathew Winn accused John Jennings of defamation of character because the latter had said to him, “You are a perjured Rogue you are a Hogstealing Rogue and I'le prove it,” the defendant was found guilty and ordered to pay to Winn two pounds and ten shillings and also the court costs.\n\nThe witchcraft incident is presented because it graphically points up those qualities of firmness and tolerance which stood Cornelius Jones in good stead in facing the problems and hazards confronting him during his lifetime. For there were perils, literally both by land and by sea. The pirate Blackbeard, the chief racketeer of the period, had become a menace to every merchant trader, who had of necessity to be constantly on the alert not only to escape the clutches of that vicious outlaw but other lesser known imitators of the same ilk. Incident to the time of Queen Anne's War (1702-1713), French and Spanish privateers freely patrolled the Carolina coast, swooping down upon any hapless schooner which could be overtaken, and at times their crews landed and pillaged coastal areas. Even more trying to a man having business to do with the public were the animosities and disputes created by the abortive rebellion headed by Colonel Thomas Cary of Bath, a struggle which left the colony exhausted. And hard on the heels of the rebellion came the most terrifying experience of all, the savage attack and massacre by the Tuscarora Indians, threatening for a time the very existence of the colony.\n\nDespite the seemingly insurmountable difficulties which he faced, Cornelius Jones managed to be a useful citizen as well as a successful one. According to the fragmentary records of the time he was one of the members of the Provincial Assembly from Pasquotank at least during the years 1708-09. He prospered in his business enterprises so that in addition to his trading operations he held title to upwards of 2500 acres of land at his death, including half of Collington Island.\n\nHe had probably followed the sea from his youth because he was master of an ocean-going vessel at least as early as 1691, in which year is noted a receipt given to him by Sarah Culpeper in behalf of her husband, John Culpeper, for a quantity and variety of items from foreign markets. In those days Captain Jones had an especial reason for pride in his vocation of merchant trader. Water-borne commerce was essential to the economic life of the settlers. There being as yet no roads, no other means of transportation remained except the ships; without them there could be no exports or imports.\n\nFor a solid historical reason in the chronicles of Camden it is necessary also to explain the relations of this successful sea captain with one James Robinson, a wandering sailor. Robinson was typical of the breed in every age who are content only to wander from one land to another, always in search of adventure in new or unknown places. Unwilling to accept the responsibilities of a family, they often sever all family ties and continue their peregrinations until restrained by infirmity or old age. Robinson may have been a business associate with Jones, more probably he was one of the crew on the master's sailing vessel. By some unknown means this sailor had acquired title to a tract of some five hundred acres adjoining Captain Jones’ plantation. In his will (probated 1700) he names his “friend” Captain Cornelius Jones as his executor and to him he bequeaths all his possessions. These lands will be referred to again because on this tract was to be built the first meeting house of Shiloh Baptist Church, organized after 1720. Here, therefore, is the beginning of the history of that ancient organization.\n\nBy contrast with Robinson, when Captain Jones made his will in 1714 he had a family to whom he was devoted. As he proceeded to divide his possessions, there may have been a twinkle in his eye and there may have been some deeper emotion. Whatever he felt, he accomplished a remarkable thing in making a bequest to his youngest daughter Ann, who was not more than seven years of age. With a few words he not only left to her a sizable legacy, he also bequeathed to her a permanent reminder of their happy associations together. The bequest reads as follows: “I give and bequeath unto my loving daughter Ann Jones and unto her heirs lawfully begotten of her body forever a peice of land out of the tract called Robinson's all the land on the east—the Plantation called the water million path walnott tree neck and ye can dance.”\n\nNot much imagination is required to visualize the adoring father and his little girl as they strolled happily around the estate. Sometimes, in season, they would go to the “walnott tree neck” to gather the tasty\n\nnuts; sometimes they took the “water million path” in pleasant anticipation of the luscious fruits awaiting them. And on occasion they paid a visit to a forest arbor of such appealing beauty the little girl danced with glee. This would be the place, of course, where “ye can dance.”\n\nAmong the multitudes who have passed their existence on the northeast side of the river, it would be difficult to find one who apparently lived with greater enjoyment or more worthily than Captain Cornelius Jones, “gentleman.”\n\n• An Indian Fighter\n\nCAPTAIN JOHN NORTON\n\nca 1680-ca 1718\n\nA GREAT MANY people in the Province of North Carolina must have taken part in some form of military activity during the years from 1702 to 1718. There were no less than four different fields of conflict, not to mention the continual brushes on the side, so to speak, with the pirates. While actual conflict with the enemy was limited during Queen Anne's War, 1702-1713, occasional forays by French and Spanish crews and the presence of their vessels off the coast made it necessary to organize and arm for defense. Numbers were active in the three-year period of internal strife known as Cary's Rebellion, 1708-1711. Troops were raised to suppress the Tuscaroras following their surprise attack and massacre of upwards of 130 colonists in 1711. And scarcely had the colony time to return to normal living after the Indian War when it was called upon by South Carolina to come to the aid of that hard-pressed colony against the Yemassee Indians.\n\nAlthough this period must have been, therefore, a time when many men were “marching as to war,” the items of information which have been preserved relating to individual participation are few and far between. John Norton is one of a small number concerning whom a few brief but authentic bits of information have survived. Even so, his life is partly a matter of surmise. Since he and Colonel William Reed were closely allied during the time of Cary's Rebellion and since Reed is known to have sided with Governor William Glover against Cary, it seems plausible to assume that Norton, a professional soldier, was\n\nactive with the Glover partisans. The first documented item about Norton's military career, however, referrs to his service in the Tuscarora War.\n\nFollowing the devastating onslaught by the Tuscaroras, Governor Edward Hyde in desperation appealed to both Virginia and South Carolina for assistance. Virginia agreed to help if pay and other concessions were guaranteed, but South Carolina immediately dispatched a few whites with about five hundred Indians under the command of Colonel James Barnwell. Joining with the North Carolina contingent the combined forces succeeded in defeating the Tuscaroras in three engagements and a truce was effected in the spring of 1712. The North Carolinians were disappointed because the Indians had not been completely subdued and refused to reimburse the South Carolinians for their efforts. In an effort to obtain some sort of recompense the soldiers from the southern colony seized some of the Tuscaroras after the truce and carried them home as slaves.\n\nIncensed at this high-handed treatment, the Tuscaroras resumed their attacks during the summer and fall of 1712. Meanwhile the condition of North Carolina had now worsened. An epidemic of yellow fever had claimed many victims, including Governor Hyde. Able Thomas Pollock, acting governor by virtue of his position as president of the council, appealed to South Carolina for help once more. That colony again responded with about 1,000 troops, mostly Indians, under Colonel James Moore.\n\nIn a public letter written in December, 1712, to “friends and neighbors” in the colony, and sent out by two Currituckians, Lieutenant Woodhouse and Thomas Johnson, Pollock stated: “I am informed by Mr. Knight that Captain Norton sailed last Saturday from Pasquotank in Major Reed's sloop with 30 or 40 men, provisions, and two Barrels powder and ten barrels I think of shot.” In all probability, therefore, Captain Norton joined Colonel Moore's command and participated in the capture of the Tuscaroras’ stronghold, Fort Nohoroco, on Contentnea Creek, in March, 1713, when the power of this warlike tribe was completely destroyed.\n\nIn 1715 the picture was reversed, for the existence of the colony of South Carolina was threatened by a fierce uprising of the Yemassees, the same tribe, incidentally, which had helped to subdue the Tuscaroras. That province directed an urgent appeal to North Carolina for help. The members of the Council of State were mindful of the help received in their hour of distress; they responded. At a meeting held May 25, 1715, the Council ordered Captain Benjamin West, Captain John Palin\n\nand Captain John Norton to call for volunteers among their companies, promising to every soldier responding to this inducement, “immediately out of ye publick treasure five pounds for and towards providing them with necessaries for their Expedition.” By this time it appears the inhabitants many have become war weary because the Council's order continued somewhat grimly: “in case of any Obstinacy or Reluctancy” the captains were ordered “to draw tenn able men from each of their Companies provided they are not those who have ye most numerous familyes.” Since North Carolina went to considerable expense to assist her neighbor to the south, it is assumed that Norton, Palin and West, and the men, accompanied the expedition. Parenthetically, it is somewhat singular that the three captains dispatched by the Council were all from Pasquotank.\n\nNorton must have come to the northeast side for an interval before 1709 because in that year he was one of the five representatives from Pasquotank in the General Assembly. In 1710 he purchased 300 acres from William Sawyer and wife Mary the part accruing to William Jennings, son of John Jennings, from his joint patent of 600 acres with Thomas Johnson in 1696. Three years later Norton and his wife Mary assigned 200 acres to Captain John Blish. The title must not have been transferred, however, since Norton's son sold this same acreage in 1724. When the northeast side of Pasquotank was formed into the Parish of St. Peter by legislative enactment in 1715, Captain John Norton was named one of the vestrymen.\n\nIn 1716 this soldier was involved in a tragic accident. He fatally shot his brother-in-law, Thomas Johnson, when the two were stalking a deer. At the hearing called to investigate the death, Norton declared he had mistaken a movement in the bushes for a deer. This occurred on December 29, 1716, and in the following January he gave William and Mary Jennings a life use of “the easternmost room above and below in my house on my plantation in the fork of Aranuse Creek” and also the privilege of raising “hoggs, cattle and fowles.”\n\nThereafter, the remainder of Norton's life is largely a matter of conjecture. His first wife Mary died at some time after 1713 and his next wife was named Jane, probably the daughter of William and Mary Jennings, since the relationship would explain the lease he gave to the couple for rooms in his house. He must have died prior to the fall of 1719, the time of the marriage of his widow, Jane Norton, to Colonel William Reed.\n\nSo far as we know, John Norton has the distinction of being the\n\nfirst “regular army man” in the Camden area whose military record is supported by authentic documents.\n\n• The Beginning of Shiloh\n\nJOHN DANSON\n\nca 1665-ca 1720\n\nTHE OPENING SCENE in the history of the village of Shiloh discloses all the elements of high romance and colorful drama. The main characters are the head of an ancient family in England who was also governor of the provinces of North and South Carolina, his two daughters, and merchant princes of London, Rotterdam and elsewhere.\n\nAn influential person in this narrative is John Archdale, whose ancestral home, Wycombe Abbey, was twenty-eight miles from London. At the age of twenty-five he was sent on a diplomatic mission to New England and for a period served as a colonel in the Maine militia. Following the death in 1678 of Lord John Berkeley, one of the Lords Proprietors, Archdale purchased this share in the name of his son, Thomas Archdale, and visited the Carolinas in 1683, where he and members of his family lived for at least three years inasmuch as he was acting governor during the absence of Seth Sothel, 1685-86. A goodly portion of those years was spent in the Albemarle, doubtless because he had found here numerous adherents of the Society of Friends, which faith Archdale had espoused. Meanwhile he had obtained a patent for 1006 acres in Pasquotank binding the river on the northwest side of “New Begun” Creek, and when he departed for England with his daughter Mary, he left his daughter Ann established upon this plantation. In 1688 Ann married Emmanuel Lowe of Pasquotank and shortly thereafter Mary became the wife of a wealthy London merchant, John Danson, the subject of this sketch.\n\nAs a business venture Danson had subscribed to a number of shares of stock in the Lords Proprietors’ enterprise for developing the territories included in the Carolinas, and as a more or less routine procedure he was granted a number of acres as reimbursement for his investment. It would seem, however, that the location of this grant on the northeast side of the Pasquotank River on a tract almost opposite the plantation already\n\noccupied by his wife's sister Ann was not an accidental occurrence. The patent was issued under the authority of Danson's father-in-law, John Archdale, who had been appointed Governor of North and South Carolina in 1694. The Governor and his kinsman, John Hawkins, also acquired title to tracts nearby on the east side of Portohonk Creek, and although his official residence was in Charleston, he spent two months in the Province of North Carolina during the summer of 1695 and made a similar visit in 1696. Archdale evidently expected his daughter Mary and her husband to make their home eventually in the Carolinas, and the Danson property was quite plausibly approved with the knowledge that the two sisters would be conveniently located near each other.\n\nDanson's grant of 3640 acres included not only the present day village of Shiloh but all the land binding the river from Portohonk Creek to Arenuse Creek, as the following verbatim description clearly shows: “beginning at a pignut at the mouth of Portabunk Creek [up] said Creek by various courses to over a branch thereof to a red oak by the side of the said branch then by a line of marked trees N. 5 degrees East 730 poles to a hiccory by a swamp of Arnoes Creek thence down the Creek by various Courses to a pine on the bank of Pasquotank River at the mouth of Arnoes aforesaid. Then down the said River by various courses to the 1st station.”\n\nThis tract became known as Danson's Manor and is so designated on the map which Edward Moseley published in 1733, even though Danson had never lived upon this spacious estate along the river. Perhaps he did not share the enthusiasm of his wife's family for living in the colony; perhaps his numerous business interests elsewhere constrained him. Whatever the reason, he procrastinated in leaving London, even after he was the recipient of a much larger portion in the Carolinas. In 1705 his father-in-law, John Archdale, bought the share formerly held by Sir William Berkeley and within a year or so bestowed this acquisition as a gift to Danson, who was permitted a choice of four “baronys” consisting of 12,000 acres each as he might select “except the lands taken up by the Yemassee Indians.” Danson still delayed, the years slipped by, and the prospect of a lordly demesne overseas never materialized, for death came to him in London about 1720.\n\nThe estate then passed to Danson's only son Jothan (or Jonathan) who had become a successful merchant in Rotterdam. Upon the death of this young man in 1724 the property fell to his only sister, Barbara, “spinster” of London, reserving always the dower rights of the widowed mother, Mary Danson. Within the next sixteen years the property changed hands several times either by purchase or bequest until it was\n\nacquired by William Dolly, a wealthy ironmonger of Middlesex. In 1740 Dolly sold the entire tract to Thomas Pendleton, except a parcel which Mary Danson had sold through her attorney, Gabriel Newby, to Sarah Bates. Pendleton was a wealthy planter who lived on the southwest side of the Pasquotank River in what is now Posquotank County.\n\nWithin a year or so Pendleton sold all of the manor lands to various individuals, the largest purchasers being William Burgess, at whose dwelling on Raymond's Creek a Baptist congregation had been organized several years before, and Samuel Williams, a well-to-do recent arrival. For almost a half century, therefore, the modern community of Shiloh remained undeveloped territory because of the ownership by John Danson, the absentee landlord who never came to occupy his domain. There had indeed been living thereon a few settlers who had failed to obtain any legal title to their habitations, and the memory of one of them, John Billet, has been perpetuated in the landmark, “Billet's Bridge.”\n\nThe effect of this long period of absentee ownership by the Danson family upon the history of this small county can best be imagined by a brief glance at what had been taking place in the meantime in several nearby settlements. In the Raymond's Creek area (now Old Trap) was the most populous community to be found on the northeast side. Two places of worship had been erected—“the Down River Chappell” by the Established Church of England and a meeting house by the Baptists. Some outstanding citizens were Cornelius Jones, William Raymond, William Burgess, John Scarborough, Isaac Guilford, John Hawkins, Alexander Canady and Phillip Torksey, who had succeeded earlier leaders like Paul Latham and John Philpott. To the north of Danson's Manor there flourished an impressive neighborhood sometimes referred to as “the aristocracy of the Forks of Arenuse Creek and North River.” Here were the homes of Thomas Gregory, probable builder of that ancient plantation, “Mt. Pleasant,” William Gregory, Colonel Griffith Jones, Colonel William Reed, Captain John Norton and William Collins. In the Sawyers Creek region were found Colonel John Solley, John Upton, Robert Morgan, Thomas and Caleb Sawyer, and others of that energetic family. Here the Established Church had built a chapel, name unknown, on the lands of Thomas Sawyer. And in the northern part of the county within the general area of South Mills, there dwelt those worthy settlers: Gabriel Burnham, Thomas McBride, Patrick Kelly, Alexander Spence, John Jones, William Joy, Robert Edney and Robert Taylor. They, too, had built a place of worship, “Forke Chappell,” near the Fork Bridge on Joy's Creek.\n\nHad development of Danson's Manor been contemporaneous with the growth of other settlements along the river, it is not improbable that here would have been the first town along the Pasquotank. What did happen when the tract was opened up was that the bay fronting the Manor soon became a place of considerable activity and several warehouses were erected for the convenience of shippers. Windmills were put in operation on the banks of the river until there were five, perhaps the largest number ever constructed on one location in Pasquotank. The name first given to the site was, understandably, Mill Town.\n\nThe opportunity for development had come too late, however. Already larger trading vessels of deeper draught were replacing the early light draught boats. Wharves would therefore be built where deeper water was convenient to the shores. Thus events were already deciding that the location of a town would finally be at “the Narrows,” as the site of Elizabeth City was then known.\n\n• A Permanent Name\n\nWILLIAM JOY\n\nca 1670-1725\n\nTHE HISTORY of the northeast side of the Pasquotank River begins around the creeks, for along these placid bodies of water the earliest settlements were made. Naturally enough the first concentration of population was along the creek most accessible to the newcomers as they came up the river from the sound. In the beginning the influx of immigrants was very gradual; in fact, the community around Raymond's Creek in the southern end of Camden flourished for about three decades before grants were issued for lands in the upper end of the county. Meanwhile, around 1690 colonization in appreciable numbers began in the neighborhood of Arenuse and Sawyers Creeks in the central part. It was around 1700 when the vanguard appeared of those who were to occupy the northern or South Mills area.\n\nAmong those later pioneers was a restless individual by the name of William Joy who seemed to have had difficulty in deciding upon a place for a permanent abode. Before 1700 he had obtained a patent for two hundred and sixteen acres, the title to which lapsed because he had\n\nfailed “to seat” it properly, that is, did not erect thereon a dwelling house or clear the acreage necessary to establish ownership. Apparently he met those requirements on another tract of three hundred and sixty-four acres, which he named “The Poplar Tables” and which he soon sold to Joseph Monck. In 1716, however, he received grants aggregating upwards of a thousand acres lying within a fork between a creek and the upper reaches of the Pasquotank River; and on these lands he was destined to spend his last days.\n\nFor more than a century the site of his holdings was referred to in real estate transactions as Joy's Fork, but the creek has continued to bear his name until the present, although in recent years the spelling has been corrupted to “Joyce.” Apparently this wanderer would not have remained in this location for any length of time, had he not been stricken with blindness. True to form, he had already begun to dispose of his properties before his affliction came upon him, two of his transactions being to Cornelius Forehand and James Jones—whose families still survive in the area. In 1717 he was blind and petitioned the court to exempt him from taxation because of his infirmity. He died in December, 1725.\n\nWilliam Joy shares with William Raymond the distinction of being one of the two individuals whose names are perpetuated in Camden by creeks—Raymond's in the southern end and Joy's in the northern. Sawyers Creek was apparently so-called for several related individuals and not for any one person. With the possible exception of Portohonk, none of our several small estuaries carry Indian designations, though Arenuse, which is a corruption of Arrownose, may have been suggested to the whites by the Indian's description of the unusual conformation of this stream.\n\nJoy's wife was named Margery and this item almost concludes the personal statistics which can be stated with certainty. Two of the legatees mentioned in his will, Solomon and Sarah Easter, may indicate a daughter and a son-in-law. Then, too, a deed of gift by his widow to Gabriel Burnham suggests another relationship. In 1733 Margery Joy, who had removed to Virginia, authorized an attorney to sell all her possessions.\n\n• Ancestor to Many\n\nTHOMAS BARECOCK\n\nca 1653-1721\n\nIT IS NOT ONLY possible for a native of Camden to be a blood relative to fifty percent or more of the county's population, but this is probably the true status of many individuals now living here. For those whose ancestors were in this vicinity two hundred and fifty years ago there must have been as a biological necessity either sixty-four or one hundred and twenty-eight distant grandparents, depending upon the intervals between generations, who were living generally in the Albemarle region. From the beginning of the Revolution in 1776, immigration to this area has been slight, especially on the northeast side of the Pasquotank River. As a consequence succeeding generations have intermarried so that over the years many family relationships have become extremely complex. Because this characteristic is so much a historical aspect of the Camden people, one early settler is included in these sketches for the purpose of indicating the multiplicity of family ties which may exist.\n\nWe do not know when Thomas Barecock became a resident but we know he was living here in 1679 with his wife, who was a daughter of another pioneer, William Jennings. According to Barecock's will, he was the father of nine children—two boys and seven girls—all of whom were married in 1721. The marriages contracted by seven of his offspring are fairly well documented and they are reviewed briefly herewith in an attempt to indicate the ensuing ramifications.\n\nOne son, William Barecock, who was evidently named for his godfather, William Jennings, married Jane Peggs who lived across the river in what is now Pasquotank County and to this couple were born two daughters and six sons. The male issue of this union would seem to be the antecedents of all of the name to be found in northeastern North Carolina, southeastern Virginia, and scattered localities in other states. Incidentally, the spelling was changed in the period immediately preceding the Revolution to “Barco,” thereby conforming orthographically to the pronunciation. A well-known parallel on the coast is found in Ocracock, which is pronounced locally as if the last syllable were spelled co.\n\nTo the genealogist the marriages of the Barecock sisters are of especial interest because their husbands were either the first of their names to settle hereabouts or, at the most, of the second generation. For example,\n\nElizabeth married the first of the Uptons—John. Although they had five sons and two daughters, let us consider only one of their progeny, a daughter Mary. She too become the bride of a newcomer, Peter Brown, and through their daughter Jane (or Jean) the Barecock strain merged into many families, the names of some of them being Bell, Burfoot, Bartlett, Forbes, Gregory, Guilford, Hughes, Squires, Stevens and Wright. Likewise, Sarah Barecock was the wife of a pioneer settler, John Sanderlin. From their four sons would seem to have derived all the Sanderlins in the regions roundabout and in neighboring parts of Virginia. In addition to those already named, among the connections of this household are those who bear the name of Burgess, Duncan, Jones, McPherson, Pritchard and Sawyer.\n\nIn October of 1701 arrived James Forbes, probably by way of Connecticut, with his wife, a daughter and five sons. Two of the latter, James and John, proceeded to woo and lead to the altar Rebecca and Martha Barecock. The descendants of those two sisters intermarried with the Brays, Learys, Torkseys and many others.\n\nIf Margaret and Priscilla Barecock did not marry brothers, their husbands did bear the same name—Gregory—and their first names were Richard and, probably, Thomas. In addition to her three sons, Margaret Gregory was also the mother of two daughters, Sarah and Mary, who merit especial mention because they took as their spouses two pioneers, a Grandy and an Humphries, both of whose descendants have played a conspicuous part in local history. Priscilla Gregory was the mother of six sons and an unknown number of daughters. The Gregorys have been numerous in the county for the past two centuries and for this reason Priscilla and Margaret may occupy a more important position, genealogically speaking, than the other children of Thomas Barecock. The Gregory connections are almost legion and some of the best known are Ferebee, Lamb, Morgan and Williams.\n\nBecause any further analysis would only add to the tediousness of innumerable details, further exploration will be omitted. What has been enumerated thus far would seem to be sufficient to establish the significance of Thomas Barecock as an ancestor in the chronicles of Camden County.\n\nBesides the details of his family, very little is known of this tribal chieftain. He owned four hundred acres of land and lived somewhere in the southern half of the county, probably near Sanderlin Swamp inasmuch as his son William is known to have lived nearby on “Barco's Island,” now known as “Garlington's Island.”\n\n• Host to the Provincial Assembly\n\nROBERT MORGAN\n\nca 1670-1727\n\nAS THE SETTLERS increased in numbers the Indians found themselves being correspondingly deprived of their lands and restricted in their hunting areas. Some of the more scrupulous of the white newcomers were both tactful and honest in their dealings with the natives. Others failed to live up to their bargains with the redskins, subjected them to gross mistreatment, and there are a few instances of record where an Indian was forced into slavery without any legal or moral justification. The Indians, also human beings, responded in kind to their treatment. They repaid broken promises with trickery and dishonesty with theft. According to one irate planter, one of their most exasperating performances was to fall upon a fat shoat feeding in the forests and to enjoy an impromptu feast of barbecued pig on the spot.\n\nIn an effort to solve the problems of friction and mounting tension between the two races, the provincial leaders began to set aside specified areas for the sole use and benefit of the Indians. Apparently the Council of State had been considering the circumstances of the Yawpim Indians on the northeast side of the Pasquotank River for a number of years without taking any definite action. In 1704 the situation seems to have become acute for on April 12, at a meeting held at the house of Captain John Hecklefield “in Little River,” the Council adopted the following directive: “Ordered that the Surveyor General or Deputy shall (with what expedition is possible) upon complaint of the Yawpim Indians lay out for the sd Indians (where they now live) four square miles of land or the quantity not injuring any of the old Settlements which was made before the order of Council bearing date in October, 1697. And Mr. John Hawkins, Mr. Thomas Taylor, Mr. Robert Morgan and Mr. John Relfe or any three of them are hereby required to attend the Surveyor or Deputy in laying out the same. To John Anderson Dep. Surveyor or to be directed to Captain Thomas Relfe to execute with Speed and make returns.”\n\nThe survey was made by Thomas Relfe and, according to a petition\n\npresented a few years later by his widow for reimbursement for his services, the tract contained 10,240 acres. The Moseley map of 1733 clearly indicates the Yawpim village with a cluster of wigwams on the reservation which included most of the present day communities of Sandy Hook and Indiantown with several thousand acres of swamp lands binding North River. The arrangement seems to have been satisfactory to the Indians inasmuch as they continued to maintain peaceful relations with their white neighbors until their departure in 1774 to join the Iroquois in New York. Fortunately the lands furnished an abundance of food supply; bear and deer are still found in the swamps and North River is a popular attraction for fishermen. Incidentally, the Indians taught the settlers a method of cooking fish which is still regarded as a gastronomical treat in the southern part of the county. When fish are netted during the late summer and fall months, the practice is to dress a freshly caught mullet, mount it on a skewer of aromatic wood, such as bay or myrtle, apply salt and pepper liberally, and roast it over a bed of coals prepared on the shore.\n\nSupervising the Yawpim survey is the first recorded appearance of Robert Morgan in a public capacity. He next appears as one of the five members in the House of Burgesses from Pasquotank during the years 1708-09. Of the few minutes of the proceedings surviving, one item records Robert Morgan and Nicholas Crisp as bringing a message “from the lower House” to the upper or Council.\n\nAn incident in which Morgan was involved in 1713 may be illuminative as to the public mind during the succession of Indian wars of that period. As a concession to the religious beliefs of the Society of Friends, whose tenets forbade them to bear arms, legislation had been enacted to permit a man to pay a fee of five pounds in lieu of military service. In Pasquotank Precinct, so the Deputy Marshal reported, Robert Morgan, John Sawyer, Sr., John Sawyer, Jr., Edward Williams, Richard Hastings and Robert Sawyer “utterly refused” to pay the five pounds due from them by act of assembly for “not going out in yeIndian Warr.” These men, who lived around Sawyers Creek, were not Quakers; indeed, three of them, including Morgan, were members of the vestry of the Parish of St. Peter. Nor was the incident an isolated one. On the southwest side of the river a man was arrested for refusing to be “impressed,” and over in Currituck two men were charged with “seducing and turning men aside” from performing military duty. Whether this attitude resulted from resentment because the Quakers were exempt from active service, or from fear that their own families would be exposed to savage attacks while they were away on the\n\nexpeditions, is not clear. Certainly no public stigma seems to have resulted from the refusal of Morgan to comply. Afterwards he was twice elected to the Assembly and also received an appointment as one of the “Gentlemen Justices” who presided over the precinct courts of quarter sessions and common pleas.\n\nA distinction, unique in Camden's history, came to Morgan during the 1725 session of the Assembly, of which he was a member. Since no capitol building had as yet been erected, legislative sessions were customarily held at the residence of one of the members. According to the minutes they first met at “Edistow,” but on November 2, the entry reads: “House mett according to adjournment with Mr. Robt. Morgan, Representative from Pasquotank.” So far as is known, this is the only time a provincial assembly was convened within the borders of what is now Camden County. The entire membership of the assembly at the time did not exceed thirty-five.\n\nThe exact location of Morgan's residence in the vicinity of Sawyers Creek has not been determined. His first recorded purchase was in 1698 for two hundred acres, and he owned eight hundred at the time of his death. It may not be amiss to add that he was a direct ancestor of General Isaac Gregory of the Revolutionary era and of the late Governor J. C. B. Ehringhaus, and he was also the progenitor of the well-known Morgan families in Currituck and elsewhere.\n\n• Acting Governor\n\nCOLONEL WILLIAM REED\n\nca 1667-1728\n\nON NOVEMBER 7, 1724, an official came to a dwelling in the forks of Arenuse Creek and presented to the dignified resident a summons from Governor George Burrington to answer certain complaints. The reaction of the indignant old man approximated an explosion. In the first place he imperiously commanded the process server not to address him as Mister but as President; in the second place he bluntly stated that he did not value the governor's orders; and, finally, in pungently crude language he directed the emissary not to leave the governor's order behind him. The arrogant gentleman was Colonel William Reed, President\n\nof the Council, who himself had a few months before completed a two-year period as acting governor of the Province of North Carolina. Obviously only a simpleton or a person entirely confident of his position would defy the official head of the government in such a brazen manner. Reed continued to be president of the council until his death four years later; and this fact would seem to be a sufficient comment upon the incident.\n\nWilliam Reed came to the Camden area after living almost thirty years in Currituck. He is mentioned as a juror in that precinct as early as 1692. For the next few years he appears to have devoted himself diligently to his business affairs and in 1700 he and Richard Sanderson were the two largest landowners in their precinct. He continued to acquire additional properties in both Currituck and Pasquotank until at the time of his death in 1728 he probably possessed the largest acreage of any person in either territory. In the meantime he had become owner of several Indian slaves whom he had apparently obtained as a result of the conquest of the Tuscaroras. In 1719 he married his second wife, Jane, presumably the widow of Captain John Norton. This would seem to be the most plausible reason for changing his residence around 1720 to the Norton estate on Arenuse Creek, where he lived the remainder of his life.\n\nReed's development as a political and military leader was a gradual process. Sessions of the General Court of Albemarle were held at his house during the years 1697-98. In all likelihood his military career began during Queen Anne's War (1702-13) when it became necessary to take steps to defend Currituck from attacks by the crews of French and Spanish privateers belligerently patrolling the coastal areas. He is known to have sided with William Glover in the struggle for control of the Assembly between that official and Colonel Thomas Cary. When the latter gained ascendancy, Reed was required to put up a peace bond of five hundred pounds. That he also participated actively in the campaigns against the Tuscaroras is a quite plausible inference. As has been noted in a previous sketch, Captain John Norton used Reed's sloop to carry ammunition to be used in the final campaigns against the Indians. During the five-year period beginning with 1710, Reed is successively referred to as captain, major and colonel. And he was a member of the Council which in 1715 ordered a detachment of troops to be raised for assistance to South Carolina. During this same year he was named one of the vestrymen of the newly formed parish in Currituck.\n\nUpon the death of Governor Charles Eden in 1722, Thomas Pollock, President of the Council, became acting governor by virtue of his position.\n\nIn September Reed was elected president, succeeding the aged and infirm Pollock, and as acting governor was voted the same salary as the governor, pending the arrival of the new appointee. George Burrington took office in 1724 and Reed continued as President of the Council until his death.\n\nIn his official capacities he displayed a prudence and restraint which seem at variance with characteristics he exhibited sometimes in his more personal affairs. His outstanding qualities were those of resoluteness and courage. His elevation to the Council in 1712, the most desperate period the colony had experienced, was a significant tribute to the boldness and strength which Thomas Pollock and the other leaders sorely needed in an era of panic and dismay. His sixteen years on the Council is the longest tenure in that body of any colonial leader, with the exception of Pollock.\n\nDespite his distinguished public career, Reed at times exhibited traits of surprising pettiness. A man of violent prejudices, he had the knack of arousing intense antagonisms. He was charged, apparently with some justification, of spreading a rumor that Governor Burrington, whom he disliked, had once been put in jail in England for beating an old woman. A young neighbor who was a witness against him in court was promptly accused by Reed with misconduct as administrator of an estate. In 1724 the Pasquotank commissioners, having decided to erect a courthouse, levied a tax for building purposes. Reed, as one of the tax collectors, attempted, so it seems, to withhold the funds in order to force acceptance of a site selected by him, instead of the one already decided upon by the commissioners. The commissioners overrode Reed but even though he was wrong in his methods, it seems only fair to observe that he may have been “wiser than his generation.” With the population increasing rapidly in the upper end of the county, he apparently foresaw that Newbegun Creek would in the near future no longer be the center of population, as well as being inconveniently located for that part now Camden County because of the wideness of the river at Newbegun and the consequent hazards in crossing. Thirty years later when the commissioners decided to move the courthouse to a more convenient location, they selected the same site Reed had chosen in the first place.\n\nAccording to an affidavit made by Colonel Thomas Swann, Colonel Reed died at his home in the forks of Arenuse Creek “in the night between the 11th and 12th of September,” 1728. The circumstances incident to his death afford such an interesting comparison between\n\ntransportation facilities in that time with the present as to justify their inclusion. According to a contemporary report he was “taken speechless.” A courier was immediately sent to summon a physician in Edenton. No doubt the messenger crossed the three intervening rivers, creeks and swamps with all possible dispatch. Doubtless the physician hastened to attend the distinguished patient. But when he arrived, Colonel Reed was dead and had been buried “the day before the doctor arrived.” Today the round trip can be made in less than two hours without violating any speed laws.\n\nIn his violent nature, it would seem, Reed more nearly reflected the undisciplined and near-lawless temper of the people he attempted to govern than any other early colonial leader. Neglected for more than two centuries, he has in recent years been the subject of some attention from state historians. Under the auspices of the State Department of Archives and History, a marker to designate the site of his last residence was erected nearby on May 23, 1954.\n\n• Site of an Ancient Meeting House\n\nANN JONES\n\nca 1709-ca 1740\n\nALTHOUGH EXISTING RECORDS afford such fleeting glimpses of Ann Jones as to suggest the appearance of a wraith in our history, actually she occupies a very permanent niche, though small, in the annals of Camden County. We see her, so to speak, only in two scenes, brief but somewhat moving.\n\nShe first appears in another sketch, it will be recalled, as the little girl who received as a heritage from her father, Captain Cornelius Jones, a tract of land with whimsical names which were probably a product of her childish imagination. They could hardly fail to serve as a reminder of the happy associations of a father and daughter as they wandered through those “pleasant delightful groves.”\n\nIn the second scene she is a young woman past her twenty-first birthday. She is harassed by some urgent financial need, the nature thereof not being indicated. In order to meet the emergency she gives to William Burgess a mortgage assignment on her property in the amount\n\nof eight hundred pounds, which, by the way, was a sizable sum for a young lady to have in hand in those days. The financial necessity seems to have become more imperative inasmuch as on July 14, 1730, she gives an outright deed to the aforesaid Burgess for an additional sum of one hundred pounds.\n\nThe deed is a verbal curiosity among the ancient transactions on record in Pasquotank Court House. There is no mention of boundaries or acreage. Following a statement that the tract had been bequeathed to her by her father, Cornelius Jones, the description reads as follows: “a piece of land called Robertson's [a misspelling of Robinson] all ye land on ye east side of the plantation called ye water million path walnut tree neck & ye can dance be ye same more or less. . . . ” This distressed young lady was selling much more than two hundred and twenty-five acres, the size of the tract as revealed in later transactions; with reluctance she was relinquishing the cherished dominion of her childhood dreams and pleasures.\n\nIt is gratifying to be able to state that by this transaction she secured for herself a permanent part in the history of one of Camden's most valued historical possessions, Shiloh Baptist Church. A congregation of Baptists had been organized prior to 1730 at the dwelling of William Burgess, the purchaser of Ann's estate. The first house of worship, according to Morgan Edwards, was built about 1736 on Burgess's lands and “largely at his expense.” There may be a question as to the accuracy of the year given by Edwards, but there is no doubt as to the approximate location of the building. Burgess eventually sold the Jones land in three separate transactions, the last one being for fifty acres to one Gideon Needham and the date was April 15, 1752. He plainly describes this land as being the remainder of a tract purchased in 1730 from Ann Jones. The deed is made in fee simple with the usual warranty “excepting the Meeting House & half an acre of land whereon the said House stands.” Since later transfers of the property can be traced, the approximate site can therefore be definitely established.\n\nFollowing the sale Ann recedes from view like a ghost and nothing further is known of her unless one accepts a dubious suggestion of marriage to young John Relfe, a member of an outstanding Pasquotank family. Unhappily, no authoritative proof has been located to support an old wives’ tale of a young woman who may be seen on occasion, when the moon is low in the west, moving with matchless grace through the woods of Wickham, as a part of Ann's estate is now known. But\n\nif satisfactory evidence were available, surely without further ado even the most cautious historian would concede the identity of the lovely apparition. For who but Ann would return again and again to her beloved domain? Who else indeed in the waning moonlight would emerge from “ye walnut tree neck” to stroll with delight along “ye water million path,” and finally in joyous abandon to pirouette with ineffable grace across the fairy swards of “ye can dance” toward the setting moon?\n\n• First Influential Citizen in North End of the County\n\nGABRIEL BURNHAM\n\nca 1690-ca 1740\n\nTHE FIRST MEN of influence on the northeast side emerged, generally speaking, in the same order as the communities in which they resided had been settled. Thus, the first two leaders, Paul Latham and John Philpott, lived in the immediate vicinity of Raymond's Creek, the earliest settlement. Death had terminated their careers by 1694 and about a decade later Robert Morgan, John Upton and the Sawyers began to be in evidence in the central part of the county—the region of Sawyers and Arenuse Creeks. Some ten or fifteen years afterwards a settler on Joy's Creek in the northern area became an influential figure and he was Gabriel Burnham.\n\nBurnham must have made a favorable impression in his neighborhood from the time of his arrival in Joy's Fork shortly before 1715. In that year by legislative enactment the northeast side of the river became the Parish of St. Peter, and he was named one of the vestrymen. For the next ten years the journals of the House of Commons have been lost, but when the records begin in 1725 we find him to be one of the representatives from Pasquotank in the Provincial Assembly, an office to which he continued to be elected through 1735. He served at least two years as treasurer of Pasoquotank, was a member of the precinct court, and “the landing of Mr. Gabriel Burnham” was designated as a place for the collection of quitrents.\n\nIn the House of Commons the parliamentary chore of courier from the lower house to the upper or council of state seems to have been\n\na special assignment of Burnham's. During eight years of his career as a member, “Mr. Burnham,” more often than any other member, was one of the pair of representatives designated to carry the messages. Some of the bills he helped to draw up where for “the Destruction of Vermin,” regulating the currency, “establishing and fixing circular courts,” and inspecting and settling accounts of all “concerned with the Publick Money.”\n\nFor some unknown reason he failed to introduce a measure very much desired by his constituents. As recorded in the proceedings of the House of Commons for November 12, 1733, this body heard the petition of “the inhabitants of Pasquotank that the N. E. Parish be erected into a sepaarte Precinct”; and Charles Sawyer and Gabriel Burnham were named as a committee to prepare a bill accordingly. They did not then submit any proposal nor when the Assembly convened again in 1735, and as a consequence the measure was introduced by two other Pasquotank lawmakers, Caleb and Daniel Sawyer. Although Governor Gabriel Johnston killed the ensuing enactment with a veto, one suspects the attitude of Burnham and Charles Sawyer in this matter explains why they were not elected thereafter to the Assembly.\n\nHe was often referred to as “Captain” Gabriel Burnham because he operated a trading vessel along with other commercial enterprises. He was a successful business man and a lucky one as well. In addition to several acquisitions of real estate by purchase, he received as a gift from Elizabeth Gambling a sizable tract “to my brother-in-law,” and William Joy's widow Margery gave him a “messuage,” the reason therefor not being stated. That he was a person of superior social standing was clearly indicated by the able, if somewhat dogmatic, Colonel Edward Moseley. The population of the Camden area in 1733 must have been upwards of a total of three hundred; nevertheless, in Colonel Moseley's opinion there were only four men hereabouts who were important enough to merit a reference on his map. Those four individuals were John Hawkins, Griffith Jones, Alexander Spence and Gabriel Burnham.\n\n• A Colonial Planter\n\nSAMUEL WILLIAMS\n\nca 1700-1751\n\nTHE COLONY of North Carolina gradually emerged into a period of comparative quiet and contentment as a result of the elimination of the Indian menace, suppression of piracy, and a more efficient governmental administration. The return of the colony to the Crown in 1729 accelerated improvement in the over-all situation. Population continued to increase rapidly and confidence in government stimulated the pursuits of agriculture and commerce. Higher standards of living to a degree not heretofore realized were clearly in evidence; roads were laid out, even if poorly maintained, trading vessels plied the waters, and more comfortable dwellings were erected. It is probably no exaggeration to state that during the fifty years or more before the Revolution, a state of prosperity was achieved in the Albemarle region not be equalled again until the advent of World War II.\n\nEvidences of individual prosperity were the plantations, those farms containing, let us say, from a few hundred acres upwards. Plantation life represented the highest standard of living and the owners were dominant factors in the economic as well as the social life about them. Dr. John Brickell, who lived in Edenton in 1730 and who wrote The Natural History of North Carolina, portrays plantation life in these words: “The Planters by the richness of the Soil, live after the most easie and pleasant Manner of any People I have ever met with: for you seldom hear them Repine at any Misfortunes in life, except the loss of Friends, there being plenty of Necessaries convenient for Life: Poverty being an entire Stranger here, and the Planters the most hospitable People that are to be met with. . . .”\n\nThe northeast side did not contain many individuals of great wealth but there were several whose possessions enabled them to live comfortably and leisurely and who were recognized as members of the planter class. Samuel Williams, who is selected as typical of the group whose chief interests were their households and friends, lived on a six hundred-acre plantation and possessed smaller tracts nearby and in Currituck, where he had formerly resided. He owned eight slaves, employed some additional help and he seems to have specialized in cattle raising, since he maintained two herds on the Outer Banks and a larger number on\n\nhis plantation. The boundaries of his estate, formerly a part of Danson's Manor, can be definitely determined and the house he built before 1750 is still standing, though in a badly dilapidated condition. One can easily visualize the vista afforded from his front porch when the lawn extended almost a quarter of a mile to the banks of the Pasquotank River, three miles wide at this point, and over which rode skipjacks, sloops and spritsails, busily engaged in traffic, somewhat the counterpart of modern motor traffic on a much traveled highway.\n\nNo study of a plantation may be considered complete, perhaps, without some attention to the members of the planter's household as individuals. Evidently Williams never held nor aspired to public office; nevertheless the many occasions on which he was called to act as trustee, guardian and member of commissions to settle estates, indicate the public estimate of his character. Other attributes are reflected in his will—often a self-revealing document. He did not follow the example of many planters—leave all real estate to his son and divide the feather beds and slaves among the womenfolk. Nor did he leave a portion of his possessions to his wife “until death or marriage”; instead he states “during her Natural Life & att her desese to be devided amongst her children as she sees fit.” He makes an equable division of his properties among his wife, son and two daughters: two slaves to each, and so on. Noteworthy are especial bequests to the girls. To Barbara he devises “all the stock of catel that belongs to me in the Kear of James Toler on the Banks.” Rebecca receives “all my catel in the Kear of Adam Baum at the Banks.” This would seem to offer proof that forage conditions on the Outer Banks two hundred years ago were superior to grazing facilities afforded there today.\n\nWilliams wrote his last testament on October 20, 1750; and six days later he adds this codicil of tragic content: “Some adishonal clases to this my last Will and Testament as it hath pleased God to take my well-beloved son Samuel before me.” He redivides Samuel's portion between his daughters and adds an unusual provision: “and further my will and desire is that my Negro James being a faithful & Trusty Servant may be free at my wife's deceas and likewise my desire is that ye sd Negro James may have two hundred and forty akers of land at Powels Point in Currituck whereon Parsifull Peace did live—to him and his proper use forever.” Williams had previously given this slave to his son Samuel.\n\nLike the head of the household, his wife and children comported theirselves with dignity and decorum all their lives. In 1750 Barbara\n\nwas married to young Captain Stephen Brent. Five years later she was a widow. Since further information is lacking, one speculates as to whether he was a casualty of the French and Indian War, lost on a trading vessel at sea, or died from natural causes. Twelve years later his widow married John Powell of Currituck, whose family is perpetuated by the landmark, Powell's Point. In 1756 Rebecca married John Forbes, who as a captain in the N. C. Militia was mortally wounded at the Battle of Guilford Courthouse, March 15, 1781. Many years afterwards Rebecca married William Snowden, who also held the rank of captain in the Revolution and was of the family from which the village of Snowden in Currituck derives its name. One wryly humorous bit of information survives concerning the widow, Mary Williams. She married one Alexander Watson, who seems to have been a person of no means but who immediately after his marriage initiated litigation to protect his “property rights.”\n\n• An Aristocrat\n\nMcRORA SCARBOROUGH\n\nca 1693-1752\n\nINSOFAR AS WE KNOW, before 1700 there were three planters on the northeast side of the river whose seals bore the imprint of a coat of arms. Those men were Thomas Merriday, his kinsman John Hawkins, and Augustine Scarborough. The latter possessed considerable acreage on both sides of the river and was one of the wealthiest citizens in the precinct. Like many of his station he also had a career as a public official—representative in the Provincial Assembly, treasurer for Pasquotank, and the like. The parentage of the seven Scarboroughs of the second generation is not clear—whether they w"
