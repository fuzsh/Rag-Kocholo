        "text": "The Fox Movie Channel has halted a summer festival of Charlie Chan films because of complaints from Asian Americans, the Los Angeles Times reports.\n\nThe network said it had been \"made aware\" that the films, which began in the 1930s, \"may contain situations or depictions that are sensitive to some viewers,\" according to the Times.\n\nThe Chan mystery series starred white actors - Warner Oland and later Sidney Toler - as a Chinese detective who cleverly solved various crimes. Chan's foil - his \"No. 1 son\" - was played by Asian actors.\n\nThe Times said the Organization of Chinese Americans Inc. was among the groups that complained about the Chan films. In a letter to Fox, the group described the movies as a \"painful reminder of Hollywood's racist refusal to hire minorities to play roles that were designated for them.\""
