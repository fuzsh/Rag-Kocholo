        "text": "Call of the Wild is a 1935 American adventure film directed by William A. Wellman which was released on August 9, 1935 by 20th Century Pictures and United Artists.\n\nIt is adapted from Jack London's 1903 novel of the same name.\n\nPlot[]\n\nSet during the Klondike Gold Rush in Alaska, traveler Jack Thornton purchases a sled dog to help him lead the way towards the treasure, but he reconsiders his journey when he finds a jilted married woman.\n\nCast[]\n\nClark Gable as Jack Thornton\n\nLoretta Young as Claire Blake\n\nJack Oakie as \"Shorty\" Hoolihan\n\nReginald Owen as Mr. Smith\n\nFrank Conroy as John Blake\n\nKatherine DeMille as Marie\n\nSidney Toler as Joe Groggins\n\nProduction[]\n\nFilming for \"Call of the Wild\" took place from December 14, 1934 to March 18, 1935 in California (at Big Bear Valley, Feather River, Tuolumne County & Mammoth Lakes), Washington (at Lake Chelan & Mount Baker) and Lake Tahoe, Nevada.\n\nProduction for the film was originally slated to film in the Southern Sierra Nevada near Sonora, but it moved when a warm front melted the snow, forcing a hasty and expensive move to Washington.\n\nDuring filming, Clark Gable and Loretta Young had an affair which resulted in the birth of their daughter, Judy Lewis. In order to avoid a scandal that would've hurt both their careers, Young claims that she went away for a while, found Judy and adopted her; however, in 1994, Judy revealed the truth in her book, \"Uncommon Knowledge.\"\n\nIn 2015, Linda Lewis (Loretta Young's daughter-in-law) stated publically that Young confided to her before her death that she was raped by Gable and even though the two of them flirted on-set, there was no affair between them.\n\n\"Call of the Wild\" was the last film released under the Twentieth Century Pictures' banner before it merged with Fox Film Corporation to create 20th Century-Fox (now renamed 20th Century Studios).\n\nCritical Reception[]"
