        "text": "Here, at the second to last of the 20th Century Fox Charlie Chan movies, after 10 years, 25 films, and two Chans, we somehow arrive at one of the very best in the series! It has all the right elements - a touch of exotica, extended nightclub dancing and singing, a psychic, affectionate rapport between Chan and his number two son Jimmy, a good mystery, and a strong supporting cast filled with red herrings. Harold Huber is along for the ride again in his fourth Chan appearance once again as the local police chief, enjoying every moment of it. Mary Beth Hughes is a joyful highlight as an angry jealous beauty with a drinking problem. And best of all Iris…\n\nHarry Lachman’s mystery comedy in which Charlie (Sidney Toler) finds a woman dead after she killed the singer she loved. Also starring Victor Sen Young, Mary Beth Hughes and Cobina Wright.\n\nThis entry in the Charlie Chan franchise concentrates on the Chinese sleuth (Sidney Toler) and his No. 2 son (Victor Sen Yung) who attempt to crack nightclub killings in Rio de Janeiro.\n\nSidney Toler gives a good performance in his role as the title character Charlie Chan, the Chinese detective who is determined to find out who is responsible for the murders, while Victor Sen Yeung is respectable as Jimmy, Charlie’s No.2 son helping him with the case.\n\nElsewhere, there are fine performances to be had from Mary Beth…\n\nRemake of an early Warner Oland Chan film The Black Camel (1931), one of the strongest Chan films with an excellent supporting cast and impressively directed by Hamilton MacFadden. MacFadden appears in a supporting role in this remake — the Bulldog Drummond wannabe, Bill Kellogg. His performance does not reveal how he felt about arriving at that point in his career. On the evidence of The Black Camel, he was a talented director. But he did not direct another film after 1937, and his last acting role in a film was in 1944’s Wilson. After that, he seems to have dropped off the map. MacFadden’s film had an A-level budget, with scenes shot on location. This B-grade programmer recreates Rio…\n\nFamous Chinese detective, Charlie Chan (Sidney Toler) comes to Rio de Janeiro to execute an international arrest warrant, and instead winds up investigating a mysterious murder involving, among other things, a sexy nightclub singer and a shady Hindu fortune-teller. Sounds exotic, right? In reality though, all we get is a teeny bit of stock footage, followed by a whole lot of white people having conversations in bland-looking rooms. (Okay, it's not all white people. Victor Sen Yung - as Chan's dumb-ass \"Number 2 son\", Jimmy - is here, as is Iris Wong as a housemaid who's mad-thirsty for said dumb ass.)\n\nThe mystery is fairly decent, and there's a whole bunch of potential suspects to choose from, even if not…\n\nEverybody needs to get to Rio sometime. The sweet samba notes float down Copacabana like a drug. But so does murder and Charlie and his Number 2 son Jimmy (Victor Sen Yung) are in Rio to arrest a murderer and bring her back to Honolulu. Why he brings his son along is a mystery. It must be take your son to work day. Victor must have been popular with the movie going audience and though listed seventh in the credits takes center stage in this one. They are here to arrest Lola, the nightclub singer (we get two musical numbers) for killing a man a few years in the past. It turns out to be a sweet and sour night…\n\nPart of the mystery involves a psychopnotist (I think that's what they called the character) who puts people into a trance by giving them a mixture of *stimulants* involving an, ahem, special herbal cigarette and coffee. Anyone got a feeling that times have changed a bit?\n\nAll the Chinese characters are shown a lot of respect, only Chan is played by a non-Asian, his son ends up getting drafted into the Army and is ready to join the war and a Chinese maid reminds someone that she doesn't speak Chinese as she is a Chinese-American and was raised in the US.\n\nSeriously, anyone who complains about these films being racist needs to get their head examined and step off their high horse."
