        "text": "HOLLYWOOD, Sept. 28 (UPI) —Mantan Moreland, the comedian who played the chauffeur Birmingham Brown in the Charlie Chan movies, died today at the age of 72.\n\nMr. Moreland made a total of 310 screen appearances. He specialized in what he called his, “indefinite” routine, which he performed in the Chan films with the late Benny Carter.\n\nOne would begin a sentence, the other would interrupt, and the, exchanges would lead into mental brick walls. Nothing made sense to the viewer, but it did to them.\n\nMr. Moreland's trademarks were his pop‐eyed expression and his line, “Feets, do your stuff.”\n\nBorn in Monroe, La., Mr. Moreland ran away with a circus at 14, later joining a comedy vaudeville act. Joe Louis „got him his first film role, in “Spirit of St. Louis,” and he subsequently worked in the “Frankie Darro” movie series for:Monogram and then moved on to the Chan whodunits with all three who played the role, Warner Oland, Sidney Toler and Roland Winters."
