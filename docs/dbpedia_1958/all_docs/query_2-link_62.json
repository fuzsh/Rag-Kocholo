        "text": "A season of 23 restored Charlie Chan films was yesterday pulled from American television following a storm of protest over its depiction of Asians and African-Americans. Showcasing 23 films from the 30s and 40s, the Charlie Chan Mystery Tour had been playing every Monday night on the cable TV station Fox Movie Channel. Each film revolves around the adventures of a wily oriental detective and his faithful black manservant.\n\nA statement by the station insisted that the aim of the season was to accentuate the \"positive aspects\" of the series, namely its \"complex stories, interesting characters and Charlie Chan's great intellect\". But it added that: \"Fox Movie Channel realises that these historic films were produced at a time when racial sensibilities were not as they are today.\" Yet Richard Konda, director of the Asian Law Alliance, disagrees. \"These films use every stereotype about Asians and other minorities that is out there,\" he says. \"The movies were racist in the 1930s and they are still racist in 2003.\"\n\nA huge hit at the time, the Charlie Chan franchise cast white actors (first Sidney Toler and later Warner Oland) as the Asian sleuth. Both Toler and Oland used sticky-tape in order to give their features a slant-eyed, \"oriental\" look and generally played Chan as a fiendishly clever yet inscrutable eccentric. The depiction of the detective's docile, uncomplicated black chauffeur also drew criticism from viewers. \"As a result of the public response to the airing of these films, Fox Movie Channel will remove them from the schedule,\" said a statement from the company."
