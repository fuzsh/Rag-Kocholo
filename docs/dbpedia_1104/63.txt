Sharlto Copley is a hot commodity in Hollywood these days. After breaking out in District 9, the actor has been showing up everywhere. In the coming months we’ll see him in the sci-fi thriller Elysium and also in Spike Lee’s Oldboy remake. It’s going to be another big year for Copley and undoubtedly, another successful one.

This week we’ve received news that the actor has chosen his next project. Titled Hardcore, the film will be directed by Ilya Naishuller. The Russian filmmaker caused a bit of buzz a while back when he did two POV shorts that impressed many. Now he has a feature deal and plans to use the same POV style.

Timur Bekmambetov is on board to produce and according to The Wrap, “the stylized action movie will feature sci-fi elements and find Copley killing a lot of bad guys to save a damsel in distress.”

Speaking to CHUD, Naishuller had this to say about Hardcore:

[The film is] a fine balance between action and story, and allows Sharlto –of whom I’ve been a big fan since District 9– to really go nuts. I don’t want to spoil anything, but his performance of the Jimmy character is sure to be very entertaining…While ‘Hardcore’ will feature a tremendous amount of breathtaking stuntwork, I will keep the amount of CGI to a minimum, sticking to our path of ‘blood, sweat and tears’ that has so far served me well.

Admittedly, I’m not familiar with Naishuller or his shorts, but this project definitely has my attention. The POV style mixed with the stylized action should make for an exciting watch and Copley always excels in sci-fi films.
