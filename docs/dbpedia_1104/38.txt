“Hardcore” is the name of a new sci-fi action film Ilya Naishuller (of ‘Bad Motherfucker‘ fame) put together. The film is shot entirely from the perspective of the hero (think a first person shooter video game.)

Serj Tankian has contribtued some music to the film, which stars Sharlto Copley of ‘District 9‘, etc. fame.

This is truly a film like no other.
