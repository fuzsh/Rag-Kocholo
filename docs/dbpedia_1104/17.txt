Ilya Naishuller, the filmmaker who brought us the two POV action short films "Insane Office Escape" and "Insane Office Escape Part 2," is developing a feature length film called Hardcore. This movie will be the first ever action film entirely shot from the POV of the main character. The film stars Sharlto Copley (District 9, A-Team), and it’s being produced by Timur Bekmambetov (Wanted).

They are currently trying to secure the funding they need to finish the movie at Indiegogo, and they’ve released some badass teaser footage that gives you an idea of what they are trying to accomplish. Here’s a description:

HARDCORE is a modern, action Sci-Fi story about HENRY, a newly resurrected cyborg who must save his wife/creator ESTELLE (Haley Bennet) from the clutches of a psychotic tyrant with telekinetic powers, AKAN (Danila Kozlovsky), and his army of mercenaries. Fighting alongside Henry is JIMMY (Sharlto Copley), who is Henry's only hope to make it through the day. Hardcore takes place over the course of one day, in Moscow, Russia and it's all shot in the same style as BAD MOTHERFUCKER to be released in cinemas worldwide.

The movie looks like it could be awesome! I’ve really enjoyed this guy's short films, and I always thought it would be great to see a feature film based on that POV idea. It looks like it’s coming, and I can’t wait to see how it turns out!

The video below starts out with the director talking about the film, and explains what they need the additional money for. It also features a message from Copley, who introduces the footage.
