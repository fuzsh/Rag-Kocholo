        "text": "Probably one of the coolest movies I had the pleasure of experiencing at the 2016 SXSW Film Festival was Ilya Naishuller’s Hardcore Henry, the violently frenetic actioner that puts you, the viewer, squarely into the mix of all the insanity with its first-person POV. Produced by the always forward-thinking Timur Bekmambetov (Wanted, Unfriended), the film stars Haley Bennett (The Equalizer), Danila Kozlovsky, Tim Roth (Reservoir Dogs), and Sharlto Copley (District 9), who also became a huge part of the process in getting Hardcore Henry successfully made.\n\nAt a recent press day for the film, Daily Dead had the chance to speak with Bekmambetov, Copley and Naishuller about their experiences working together on Hardcore Henry. The trio discussed the difficulties of telling the story via an action-driven vision, the challenge of sustaining the POV format, collaborating on the project, and how Hardcore Henry pushed their limits as a collective filmmaking unit.\n\nCheck out our video interview below and look for Hardcore Henry in theaters everywhere on Friday, April 8th, courtesy of STX Entertainment."
