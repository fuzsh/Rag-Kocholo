        "text": "Way before we all came to know and love Sharlto Copley as Wikus in District 9, he was actually working on a budding career as a director. Back in 2006, Copley co-directed a feature with production partner Simon Hansen, a thriller starring Rutger Hauer and Darren Boyd (\"Personal Affairs\") called Spoon. And after many years of waiting, an early teaser trailer has hit the web, courtesy of Twitch, giving us our very first look at Rutger Hauer as Victor Spoon. It's kind of creepy in a sense, almost in a Cronenberg kind of way, and it's about a guy who blacks out during moments of extreme stress. So uh, just check this out... if you're curious.\n\nWatch the teaser trailer for Simon Hansen & Sharlto Copley's Spoon from YouTube:\n\nA thriller with supernatural overtones about a man with a medical condition that causes him to black out during moments of extreme stress, which helps lead him to make a remarkable discovery about himself.\n\nSpoon was both co-directed and co-written by South African filmmakers Sharlto Copley and Simon Hansen, who run the company Inspired Minority Pictures and have been working together for a while. Hansen is also a producer and also worked with Copley on Neill Blomkamp's Alive in Joburg short film. A company named Distant Horizon is listed as a distributor in the US, but we're not sure if that's accurate. Either way, we'll do our best to follow Spoon, which Twitch says \"is now complete\" and coming soon. Is anyone interested?"
