A beautiful woman called Estelle (Haley Bennett), who claims to be Henry's wife, explains that he has been reanimated from the brink of death as a half-human, half-robotic soldier with superhuman powers.\n\nBefore she can explain further, an albino crimelord called Akan (Danila Kozlovsky) storms the facility with his henchmen and abducts Estelle.\n\nHenry's in an unfamiliar city of Moscow, and everyone wants him dead. Everyone except for a mysterious British fellow called Jimmy (Sharlto Copley).\n\nBlood flows and the body count rises as Henry completes a series of gruesome tasks, leading to a showdown with Akan, who possesses telekinetic powers.\n\nIf Henry can survive the insanity and solve the mystery, he might just discover his purpose and the truth behind his identity."
