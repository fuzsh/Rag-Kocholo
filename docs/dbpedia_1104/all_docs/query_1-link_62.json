        "text": "The first thing you notice about Sharlto Copley, who grew up in South Africa and had not acted much until recently and somewhat fell into the lead role of the sci-fi extraterrestrial extravaganza “District 9,” is that he looks nothing like Hitler.\n\nWhich is probably not what he expects to hear on his first press tour for his first film.\n\nBut it’s also not what you’re expecting after you see Copley’s squirrelly, convincing performance in the movie, directed by an old friend, Neill Blomkamp.\n\nCopley plays a South African bureaucrat charged with evicting the Sasquatch-size lobster men who have been stranded in Johannesburg for 20 years, driving them from one shanty slum to the next, increasingly more degrading camp. As a parable for apartheid, it’s overt.\n\nBut the Hitler thing is not. Copley plays Wikus — the name itself almost suggesting Blomkamp thought of the character as a kind of Wiki for “tyrannical company man.”\n\nWikus, as Copley plays him, is one part Michael Scott from “The Office,” boxy and awkward, one part totalitarian creep, ensuring that the marginalizing of his targets is handled with a bloodless, efficient hand.\n\nBut he’s not a villain, not ultimately, and Copley, in his mid-30s, is leaner and more movie-star rugged than the picture suggests.\n\nQ: You haven’t heard the Hitler comparison yet?\n\nA: No, and it’s fascinating. The mustache, I see. But it is a Hitler hairstyle in the film!\n\nQ: Your idea?\n\nA: All Neill — the character came from a short he made in 2005, but he let me create the rest of it, and improvise all of the dialogue.\n\nQ: Improvising against nothing? Against CGI?\n\nA: Well, no. The next biggest role in the film was held by this guy named Jason Cope, who played all of the creatures in the film. He was in this gray suit, which they kind of painted the aliens onto later. Neill had a script and a structure, but it was much looser while shooting.\n\nQ: Yet you’re not an actor, though, not really. You helped found a TV station in South Africa and produced lots of commercials and videos. Do you set out to talk to bureaucrats to figure out how to play this — people who were involved with apartheid?\n\nA: No. Neill told me to imagine an old bureaucrat from the apartheid era, but imagine it’s an alien situation. He has to go once a month and leave his desk to deal with these creatures, which he doesn’t want to do. My character really developed on camera, when other actors asked me questions.\n\nQ: You know, the thing I wondered while watching the film was whether a chunk of the audience — presuming the film is being sold to young men — will even pick up on the apartheid metaphor, regardless of how obvious it is. In the 15 years or so since black rule, it’s remarkable how little you hear of apartheid. You’re more likely to hear of South African beaches.\n\nA: I think you certainly have those issues here — I am fascinated by this whole fence or wall or whatever they want to build between the U.S. and Mexico. But I take your point — it’s incredible how fast everyone chooses to forget those things. The amazing thing is it did change. As a white South African, I was proud to say that 75 percent of whites voted for a democratic South Africa.\n\nI went to a private school with other kids from families who had money, and people don’t know this but these were British system-type schools, which took kids from all races. I had a mini-United Nations environment. My best friends were black and Indian. Every now and then you went into Soweto, and I had been in townships during apartheid, but it was really only after high school did I understand it. The government was very good at creating an illusion of normalcy.\n\nQ: Did you set out to play Wikus as a South African who knows what he’s doing is wrong?\n\nA: He had to be naive to certain things and never thought about them, and to have taken negative qualities from his parents and from society — but, no, I think he totally believes what he is doing is right, and he feels he has tested his ideas and seen certain behavior and validated it.\n\nBut he has never really thought about it. And as an actor, you’re playing what all human beings do — he has his own little world and value set, and it’s not convenient for him to test it and still get through the day.___"
