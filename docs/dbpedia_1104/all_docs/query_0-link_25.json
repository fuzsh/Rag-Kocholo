        "text": "Sharlto Copley, the star of director Ilya Naishuller‘s video game-inspired Hardcore, likened the film’s viewer experience to a rollercoaster ride during a sit-down with The Hollywood Reporter at the Toronto Film Festival.\n\n“It’s an immersive experience more than just a film. It’s sort of a spectacular ride,” the actor said of the film, billed as the first-ever action movie filmed entirely from the hero’s first-person viewpoint. “When these guys originally approached me with it, I thought, ‘If I was an 18-year-old boy playing video games, I would go crazy to see a film shot like this.’ ”\n\nNaishuller noted that Hardcore was filmed with a specially-designed camera that utilized multiple GoPro mobile cameras to catch all of the stunt sequences, all of which were shot by professional stuntmen.\n\n“Every shot in the film — bar maybe two or three — was shot by a stunt guy/cameraman. Everything we see is not just the camera being thrown off the side of a building. It’s a guy getting thrown off the side of a building,” he told THR. “All the stunts are real.”\n\nSome of the action stunts the stuntmen and actors involved in the making of the film had to endure included hanging from a helicopter, flying out of a bus window and getting set on fire.\n\nNiashuller added, “We actually have a safety record that beats big Hollywood productions. We have five stitches on a guy’s head on a stunt. That’s it. I thought we’d break an arm or a leg.”\n\nWatch THR‘s full chat with the Hardcore cast in the video above."
