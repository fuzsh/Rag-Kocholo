        "text": "\"We're gunna make you cool, and tough!\" Yesterday Sony debuted the first trailer for the new movie from Neill Blomkamp, titled Chappie, which tells the story of a young robot being brought into a brutal world. Fans of this music group may have already spotted them, but for everyone else, it's time to introduce you to Ninja and Yo-Landi Vi$$er from the South African group Die Antwoord. We've known they were in the cast since they were included in the early production announcements last year, but it's good to see them in the trailer and it seems they are main characters with a key role in the plot. View even more photos below.\n\nDie Antwoord, which translates to \"The Answer\" in English, is a popular South African rap group formed in Cape Town in 2008. Neill Blomkamp was born in South Africa and has shot most of his three films there, including Chappie, so it makes sense he would reach into the local community (the same way he did casting Sharlto Copley in District 9). So Ninja and Yo-Landi were cast in the movie, along with Dev Patel, Hugh Jackman, Sigourney Weaver and Sharlto Copley (as the voice of Chappie), and are making their acting debut in a Hollywood movie. Timed with the release of the trailer their new music video for \"Ugly Boy\" launched.\n\nCheck out the music video above, along with the photo of Ninja (L) and Yo-Landi (R) from the trailer. In Chappie, Dev Patel programs a humanoid robot to have life-like AI features, but the robot ends up on the streets. As far as we know, he's eventually \"adopted\" by Ninja and Yo-Landi who raise him like their own child, teaching him how to be tough and cool, and how to survive on the streets. Eventually you can see Chappie wearing gold chains and looking gangsta while rolling around town. But, of course, when the bad guys want their robot back these two get mixed up in the mayhem. I love the story setup, and I'm curious to see how it plays out in Blomkamp's world. Here's a few shots from the trailer of Ninja, Yo-Landi & Chappie:\n\nFor more on Die Antwoord, check out their official website or grab their latest album \"Donker Mag\". We expect them to be a part of the marketing as this gets closer to release, but for now I'm glad they're showing up in the trailer this much. Maybe they have a future in film? For more on Chappie follow @SonyPictures.\n\nEvery child comes into the world full of promise, and none more so than Chappie: he is gifted, special, a prodigy. Like any child, Chappie will come under the influence of his surroundings – some good, some bad – and he will rely on his heart and soul to find his way in the world and become his own man. But there's one thing that makes Chappie different from anyone else: he is a robot. Chappie is the third film written and directed by South African sci-fi auteur Neill Blomkamp, following up his films Elysium and District 9 previously. The script was co-written by Terri Tatchell, based on Blomkamp's short Tetra Vaal. Filming took place down in South Africa last year, with a cast including rappers Die Antwoord and Hugh Jackman. Sony Pictures has Blomkamp's Chappie set for release starting on March 6th, 2015 next year. We're in."
