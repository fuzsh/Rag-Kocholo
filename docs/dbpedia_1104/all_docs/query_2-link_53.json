        "text": "“The Witcher” Season 4 has cast Sharlto Copley, James Purefoy, and Danny Woodburn, Variety has learned exclusively.\n\nCopley will play the infamous bounty hunter Leo Bonhart from “The Witcher” novels. Purefoy will play Skellen, a high-ranking spy and court advisor to Emhyr who is also a prominent figure in the novels. Woodburn will play Zoltan, a fan favorite dwarf character from the novels and “Witcher” video games.\n\nThe trio join previously announced cast members Liam Hemsworth, who takes over the lead role of Geralt of Rivia from Henry Cavill, as well as Anya Chalotra, Freya Allan, Joey Batey, and Laurence Fishburne.\n\nCopley is best known for his breakout role in the sci-fi film “District 9.” He has since starred in features such as “The A-Team,” “Elysium,” “Chappie,” and “Hardcore Henry.” He also stars in Dev Patel’s upcoming film “Monkey Man” and appeared in multiple episodes of the Netflix series “Russian Doll.”\n\nHe is repped by UTA.\n\nPurefoy has previously appeared in live-action Netflix shows like “Altered Carbon” and “Sex Education,” as well as animated shows like “Trollhunters: Tales of Arcadia” for the streamer. He is known for his roles in TV shows like “Rome” at HBO and “Hap and Leonard” for Sundance Channel. He has also starred in films such as “Mansfield Park,” “A Knight’s Tale,” and “Fisherman’s Friend.”\n\nHe is repped by CAA, Independent Talent Group, and Brillstein Entertainment Partners.\n\nWoodburn is perhaps most recognizable for his time on “Seinfeld” in the role of Mickey, an actor and friend of Kramer’s. He has appeared in dozens of other notable series, including “Murder, She Wrote,” “Baywatch,” “Beverly Hills 90210,” “CSI,” “One Tree Hill,” “Monk,” and “Bones.” Woodburn is also a celebrated activist and advocate for people with dwarfism and disabilities within the entertainment industry and at large.\n\nHe is repped by International Artists Management and Priluck Company.\n\n“The Witcher” Season 4 will begun production this spring. Season 3 of the series aired on Netflix between June and July 2023. The official description for the new season states:\n\n“After the shocking, Continent-altering events that close out season three, the new season follows Geralt, Yennefer, and Ciri who are faced with traversing the war-ravaged Continent and its many demons apart from each other. If they can embrace and lead the groups of misfits they find themselves in, they have a chance of surviving the baptism of fire — and finding one another again.”\n\nLauren Schmidt Hissrich serves as the creator, showrunner, and executive producer of “The Witcher.” Sophie Holland is the casting director. Steve Gaub, Mike Ostrowski, and Javier Grillo-Marxuach executive produce along with Tomek Baginski and Jarek Sawko of Platige Films and Jason Brown and Sean Daniel of Hivemind Content."
