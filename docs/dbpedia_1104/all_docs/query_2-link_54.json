        "text": "Capsule reviews: CHAPPiE\n\nErin: If Robocop were a three-year-old.\n\nCassandra: You’ll probably feel the same way about it as you did the first time you saw Starship Troopers.\n\nErin’s Take\n\nAccording to the sources I tend to trust on the quality of movies, I was supposed to hate this one. And certainly that was what I expected going in, but we had been invited by friends, and I was determined to not be a critical d-bag about the film choice. My low expectations helped me take the film for what it was and enjoy it despite its flaws.\n\nThe other thing that primed me to like CHAPPiE was our theater’s decision to show clips of related films before the main feature–a luxury of not having to show advertisements. What they chose is telling of the film: Robocop (1987, dir. Paul Verhoeven), Short Circuit (1986, dir. John Badham), and I, Robot (2004, dir. Alex Proyas). CHAPPiE plays like a mash-up of these three films. That seems to bother many critics who don’t see how the three different sets of ideas and tones match up, but I had no problem navigating the film’s turns. It may also be telling, however, that with the exception of Robocop, these films are seen as mediocre on RottenTomatoes and Metacritic.\n\nCHAPPiE’s premise: In the near future, in Johannesburg, a company named Tetra Val has created robot “Scouts” to assist police and has effectively dropped crime. But inside the company, there are two developers with different plans. One is Hugh Jackman’s mulleted Vincent Moore, who has designed a human operated robo-tank named “Moose.” It has less appeal to the police than the Scouts because it is big, ugly, and overkill. The other developer is Scout-creator Deon Wilson, played by Dev Patel, who has managed to create a conscious AI. He wants to test his program on a Scout set to be demolished, but Tetra Val boss Michelle Bradley (Sigourney Weaver) wants none of it. She wants Deon to be happy with the Scouts’s success. But was God satisfied with his success after day 5 of creation? So Deon steals the Scout body set for destruction to install his consciousness.dat file. In the meantime, a group of street criminals (played by Die Antwoord) botch a job and get in debt big to the local kingpin. They think that if they can get one of the guard keys to the Scouts, they can reprogram it to work for them and pull a huge heist to get them out of their $20 million debt. So they kidnap Deon with the Scout in the back and the guard key to install the consciousness program. Thus Chappie is born–and he truly is an infant at the start. He learns as a human learns, though faster, and the street criminals and Deon play at-odds parents to the fledgling AI. Also meanwhile, Moore has plans to make Moose more appealing to the police.\n\nOkay, so one of the film’s flaws is pretty clear from that premise: there is too much plot here. And the grand explosive finale doesn’t quite justify the threats to Chappie from all sides. But that’s all I want to say about that.\n\nWhat really got me good, got me truly hooked, was the depiction of Chappie on his second day of “life” which roughly corresponds to toddlerhood. He’s picking up phrases, mimicking the humans around him, he accepts guidance and criticism in short “yesses” and “nos.” He was, in short, my nearly 3-year-old. The writing, the animation, and Sharlto Copley’s performance combined to absolutely make it authentic.\n\nIn fact, throughout the film, Chappie is, ironically, the most realistically human of all the characters. The other characters are all overblown caricatures. I believe this is a feature, not a bug. Hugh Jackman’s Moore is the first tip-off of this. He sports a mullet, open carries a handgun, and after the meeting where the police tell him Moose isn’t necessary or welcome to what they hope to accomplish on the streets, he looks into a mirror (suggesting a split of his personality but also calling to mind Maleficent in Sleeping Beauty) and takes on a villainous grin. His character is writ so largely he might as well be a Disney villain. After seeing that in Jackman, who can act subtly when called for but clearly isn’t doing so here, the fairy tale-esque characters are visible everywhere. Our caricatured street thugs played by Die Antwoord, Deon the Creator, even Weaver’s boss, all of them seem more suited to satire or cartoon than a realistic sci-fi film. The ending of the film likewise is fairy tale-esque.\n\nThis is where Paul Verhoeven’s influence is felt (both Robocop and Starship Troopers). Because while this film smacks of the allegorical, it is a slapsticky smack. This film is not taking itself too seriously. While it doesn’t overtly seem to be satirical, it rides that border. With the allegorical elements, the comedy makes for an interesting statement on the construction of human violence–the elements that combine to push a person from innocent, curious child to remorseless killer. The film doesn’t take a light hand with this lesson, but the comedy makes it far more enjoyable.\n\nCassandra’s Take\n\nI watched the CHAPPiE trailer on Hulu, ’cause robots. I was amused to see Die Antwoord and touched by the emotive Briareos antennae and childlike sense of wonder. But I knew we weren’t going to catch it in the theater. I can still count on my hands the number of films we’ve seen on a screen since our toddler was born, but only just.\n\nI sort of rode the initial excitement generated by the trailer and the almost inevitable souring and cynical backlash as the marketing process and early reviews spooled out. I think a lot of folks expect Blomkamp to replicate the feeling they got from District 9, a feeling a lot of the same folks have reconsidered in the intervening years. I wasn’t chasing anything.\n\nCHAPPiE‘s a good movie. It juggles a lot plot with deft hands. You’ve got the accelerated learning curve of an emerging artificial intelligence, several interpersonal and professional conflicts, and an unsustainable social crisis maintained and exacerbated by the primary subject of the story. As a viewer, you’re never confused. Never bored.\n\nThat’s because CHAPPiE is a fairy tale. Concise. Clean. Broad. Abrupt. Erin mentioned that the robot is the most human character and that’s kind of the point. The supporting cast is made up of familiar types grafted onto a recognizable context built from generic conventions. If Robocop, Appleseed, Short Circuit, or Blade Runner come to mind, then it’s working as intended. The viewer feels at home and can move on.\n\nFor some critics, this kind of thing can become a game they play with themselves, the director, and their audiences. Where’s this shot from?\n\nThat’s a bit of a trick, actually. It’s everywhere because it’s amazing and evocative. It really should be in everything from wedding photos to Star Wars. My point is that the visual references to Almost Human, Dredd, and whatever else are there to delight and dazzle because the Johannesburg of CHAPPiE is impossible. As impossible as a kingdom whose princes are turned to ravens.\n\nAnd just like that kingdom, everyone but the protagonist is there to serve a purpose. Chappie’s creator, his adoptive parents, his nemesis, his cool uncle, the CEO. You get the idea. Chappie lives in and because of these relationships.\n\nLike a fairy tale, it refracts the values of the viewer. Sure, it has a message. You can’t miss the commentary on drone warfare and the militarization of police departments.\n\nMake no mistake, though, CHAPPiE is a comedy in pretty much every sense of the word. I suppose whether it’s funny or not is up to you, dear viewer. But it’s not taking itself too seriously. Because it’s a fairy tale, because it’s impossible, it allows stuff like assault with a deadly weapon in the workplace to go unremarked. Consciousness is revealed to be more or less identical whether silicon or carbon. There are cuts to security camera footage that those of us in the theater seats seem to be the only monitors of. And there are moments like this which you’ve seen countless kids and dogs do.\n\nThe movie focuses the competing influences arrayed about Chappie once he gains sentience and how those influences are absorbed and integrated into the person he becomes. Yup, person. There’s a journey from object to subject, from child to adult, and from creation to equal.\n\nExplosions and body horror accentuate the chaotic, nonlinear, asymmetric process we all go through growing up. In true fairy tale fashion, violence externalizes the social and psychological conflicts inherent in becoming a member of a community and establishing boundaries. Like Starship Troopers, it goes considerably over the top, so your mileage may vary.\n\nThe forthcoming back-end of Once Upon a Time’s season 4 has us trying to bone up on the new villain trio: Cruella De Vil from 101 Dalmations, Ursula from The Little Mermaid, and Maleficent from Sleeping Beauty. We started with the latter, skipping the classic Sleeping Beauty film for the recent re-imagining of the story, Maleficent.\n\nIn this retelling, we get a very different view of Maleficent, starting with her joyful youth in the Moors, the fairy-magic world, continuing to her meeting of a young human whom she falls in love with, and then his betrayal of her, turning her bitter and vengeful. When she hears that the human, who betrays her to become king, has recently had a baby, she visits the Christening and curses the child in the familiar way: by the child’s sixteenth birthday, she will prick her finger on a spindle and fall into a death-like sleep which only true love’s kiss can bring her out of. It’s an ironic out clause–Maleficent no longer believes true love’s kiss even exists.\n\nThen, as the girl ages, Maleficent watches her in vengeful obsessiveness, slowly growing to care about her. She realizes the girl might be the one to heal the rift between the fairy and human lands.\n\nAngelina Jolie stars as the title character with cosmetically emphasized cheekbones and massive horns and wings, and she ends up being kind-of perfect for the role. She plays the traditional villain with aplomb, sporting that bright red lipstick and devilish smile to thrilling effect. Much of her acting happens in close up in her eyes–a wariness toward the “beastie” that is young Aurora, a disdain for the three fairies left in charge of caring for and protecting Aurora, open vulnerability as Aurora gets closer to the curse’s fate and Maleficent cannot call it off.\n\nOpposite her is Sharlto Copley, who also played the infected bureaucrat from District 9, as Stefan, her once love now betrayer and king. Copley’s Stefan is written and acted with less range–after all, he’s the villain here. What he does portray wonderfully is the dangerous madness his betrayal and Maleficent’s curse drive him to.\n\nElle Fanning does fine in the film, but she lacks the dynamic charisma of Jolie or even Copley in their roles. The world-building is beautiful, though at times a little fake looking, and I can imagine that certain scenes where Maleficent is flying were breath-taking in 3D.\n\nWhat truly elevates the film is the twists Disney has given to its classic villain’s origins and the concept of true love. The rest of this review will have spoilers in it, so abandon ship now if so desired.\n\nMaleficent is a joyful and protective character until her betrayal. Stefan, a man she had loved and who she thought loved her, drugs her and cuts off her wings. It plays like a date rape, although in suggestion more than explicitness–this is Disney, after all. Her shock and agony upon waking to find her wings gone is truly painful to watch. I had tears well up in my eyes–a testament to Jolie’s acting to portray the anguish. The betrayal makes her into the vindictive villain she becomes, and this makes a statement about the circularity of violence and abuse, especially when her violence turns itself onto the next generation, Aurora, rather than being directed back at Stefan.\n\nBut most interesting is a repetition of a twist we see in Frozen as well. Maleficent and Stefan are both sure that true love doesn’t exist. The fairies and Maleficent first try to get Prince Philip to kiss Aurora, but as he points out, they hardly know each other, so how could it be true love? His kiss fails. It turns out to be a kiss of familial love–that from Maleficent for Aurora that stops the violence and lifts the curse. So again, Disney is subverting its own cliches in its modern movies."
