        "text": "Sony previewed the new trailer as well as 10 minutes of footage from their upcoming sci-fi thriller Elysium for IGN and other select members of the press Monday, with director Neill Blomkamp, producer Simon Kinberg and stars Matt Damon (via satellite from Germany) and Sharlto Copley in attendance. The trailer will debut online tomorrow.\n\nHere's the official synopsis for the movie: \"In the year 2159, two classes of people exist: the very wealthy, who live on a pristine man-made space station called Elysium, and the rest, who live on an overpopulated, ruined Earth. The people of Earth are desperate to escape the planet's crime and poverty, and they critically need the state-of-the-art medical care available on Elysium - but some in Elysium will stop at nothing to enforce anti-immigration laws and preserve their citizens' luxurious lifestyle. The only man with the chance bring equality to these worlds is Max (Matt Damon), an ordinary guy in desperate need to get to Elysium. With his life hanging in the balance, he reluctantly takes on a dangerous mission - one that pits him against Elysium's Secretary Delacourt (Jodie Foster) and her hard-line forces - but if he succeeds, he could save not only his own life, but millions of people on Earth as well.\"\n\nIt might be too early to say he's done it again, but from the new trailer and 10 minutes of sizzle reel footage Blomkamp showed Elysium certainly looks as daring and cool as District 9. Visually, it could almost be the same Earth from District 9, but decades after the aliens left. It is a similarly impoverished and segregated society, but this time along economic lines rather than species. Where District 9 was a sci-fi allegory for racism, Elysium is about economic disparity; think of it as a sci-fi action movie for the 99%, although Blomkamp said he was not directly influenced by that movement as his film was already in production when Occupy Wall Street was going on. The outskirts of Mexico City, including shooting in one of the world's largest garbage dumps, doubled as Earth's shanty towns, while the scenes on Elysium (which the director dubbed \"Bel Air in space\") were shot in Vancouver.\n\nWithout delving into too many SPOILERS, the footage began with Max, an ex-con who now works in a factory of sorts,getting roughed up by police droids who break his arm for being a wiseass during questioning. We then see Max at a hospital where he is reacquainted with Fray, a nurse who is also an old flame of his. (Later in the footage we see that she has a child, who we're not sure is supposed to be Max's or not.) Back at work, we meet Max's a-hole boss and then see Max get irradiated in a workplace accident.\n\nGiven just five days to live, he accepts a job from some toughs (played by Wagner Moura and Diego Luna) to have an exo-skeleton painfully grafted to his ailing body -- which gives him superior strength -- so he can help them attack a tycoon named John Carlyle (William Fichtner), who is protected by the armored droids humans have come to fear and loathe. Managing to shoot down Carlyle's vessel as it heads to earth on business and take out the droids during a vicious firefight, Max and his cohorts then jack into Carlyle's head and steal information from his brain -- downloaded data that threatens Elysium's very way of life.\n\nThis theft prompts Elysium's Jessica Delacourt to send the vicious Spec Ops agent Kruger (Copley) after Max and retrieve the stolen data. As payment, Max wants the toughs to get him passage to Elysium -- where they wealthy live in a world without diseases and where machines can even eliminate cancer -- where he can cure himself before time runs out.\n\nRocking a very nasty, unkempt beard, Kruger has metallic pieces embedded in his face and body that serve as magnets and latches for him to quickly snap on and off different armor or apparatuses during battle. This is a man who will shoot down space ships illegally headed toward Elysium with an air-to-surface shoulder-fired rocket. He's all about the job, not necessarily the politics of the mission. Although wealthy enough to live on Elysium, Kruger instead lives in the slums of Earth so he can be called into service as needed.\n\nAfter toying with different nationalities and accents, Copley and Blomkamp settled on making Kruger a South African, but using a South African accent unfamiliar to most American audiences. Copley said he patterned Kruger after members of South Africa's 32 Battalion, who served in the bush for extended periods of time during different campaigns."
