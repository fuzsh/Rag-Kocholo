        "text": "The filmmakers behind upcoming action movie “Hardcore” have released the first footage, which features a character blowing up bad guys through his point of view, while “District 9” star Sharlto Copley leads the way.\n\nWritten and directed by Ilya Naishuller, an Indiegogo campaign seeking $250,000 for post-production costs is positioning “Hardcore” as “the first ever action POV feature film.”\n\nAlso read: Former DGA President Michael Apted Launches Indiegogo Campaign for ‘Married in America’\n\nUniversal’s 2005 adaptation of popular video game “Doom” used the same perspective for a 5-minute sequence intended to pay homage to the first-person shooter. While the movie was panned by critics, Naishuller and producer Timur Bekmambetov (“Night Watch”) are hopeful that audiences can appreciate an entire movie that unfolds as if they’re watching someone else play a violent video game.\n\n“Hardcore,” which has already been shot and edited, follows a newly resurrected cyborg who must save his wife/creator (Haley Bennet) from the clutches of a psychotic tyrant (Danila Kozlovsky) with telekinetic powers, and his army of mercenaries.\n\nAlso read: ‘District 9’ Star Sharlto Copley Joins Michelle Forbes in ‘Powers’\n\nCopley, who was last seen on the big screen as a crazy king in Disney’s “Maleficent,” plays the hero’s sidekick, of sorts.\n\nNaishuller’s first feature comes after his POV-style short, “Bad Motherfucker,” racked up over 23 million views on YouTube, and Bekmambetov approached him with the idea of making a theatrical release shot in the same style.\n\nSee video: TheGrill: Crowdfunding Experts Ponder the Question of What’s In It for the Crowd (Video)\n\nNaishuller calls it “one hell of an experience,” so watch the footage (above) and decide for yourself."
