        "text": "“Hardcore Henry” is an intense action attraction told completely from the point-of-view of an all but dead, apparently very dangerous fellow who awakens without memory or voice to find himself being turned into a cyborg.\n\nHenry escapes from an attack on the facility where he’s being put together, but not before the bad guys kidnap the beautiful woman, Estelle (Haley Bennett), who resurrected him and, oh yeah, tells him she’s his loving wife. Chased through the streets and outskirts of Moscow by armies of assassins, Henry must figure out how to rescue her, who he is and what’s going on. The path of destruction is awesome.\n\nSharlto Copley does not play Henry, but is the actual star of the film. While the title character, whom we never see, was essayed at various times by a dozen or so stuntmen, director Ilya Naishuller or a member of the camera crew wearing GoPros rigged onto their faces, Copley’s Jimmy is the only guy to come along to maybe help the confused protagonist. Until he gets killed. But then he shows up again, slightly different, and with more key information. Blow head off, rinse, repeat, immolate, et cetera.\n\n“There are 11 different incarnations of the same character,” the 42-year-old Copley, who was also an executive producer on the film, explains. “That was the highlight of the project for me, getting to play different characters, and interesting characters, too. They couldn’t be too different, and we were testing how far they could go.”\n\nThat was hardly “Hardcore Henry’s” biggest challenge. The South African actor, best known for putting himself through all kinds of torment for pal Neill Blomkamp’s sci-fi epics “District 9,” “Elysium” and “Chappie,” had to both talk to and perform various sorts of physical action against mute “co-stars” who were also constantly moving and framing cameras for what turned out to be more than a first-person shooter production.\n\n“This was officially the hardest movie I’ve ever made,” Copley confirms. “One of the most challenging aspects of the filmmaking process for me as an actor was that, normally, you’re used to playing against another actor or, in exceptional circumstances, just an eyeline on the wall or a visual effects mark for something that’s going to be put in later.\n\n“This was a strange sort of hybrid. The guys had the GoPro mounted underneath their own eyes, sort of like a helmet face mask. I’d start a scene, maybe with Ilya the director and he’s actually acting with you, engaging non-verbally, and then all of a sudden he disconnects and he’s just framing you, watching, judging your performance. Then suddenly, he’s engaging you again.”\n\nTakes were, of course, blown. The fact that Russia doesn’t provide anywhere near the location shooting support filmmakers enjoy in North America and the rest of Europe (Wanna shoot a car chase on the streets of Moscow? Don’t expect the city to close off roads for that and, by the way, it’s probably best not to even ask for permission) was a factor in that. Safety requirements are pretty non-existent, too, leaving Copley marveling that, after 85 stunt days worth of shootouts, explosions, car wrecks, rooftop chases and the like, the total casualty count was six stitches and a chipped tooth.\n\nSome days, it seemed a lot worse.\n\n“We had to do three takes of the scene where I’m driving and hitting police cars,” Copley recalls. “The first time, I actually thought I’d killed a stunt guy, because after he’d let go of my vehicle we felt a ‘ba-dunk’ and thought we’d driven over him. Ilya was in the passenger seat filming and we both blew the take, we both turned and our faces went ashen. We saw this guy lying in the road, there was normal traffic now coming past and the radio wasn’t working, he wasn’t moving and we didn’t know if he was just in character now.\n\n“I was certain I’d driven over him. We had to go around this very long block because it was a one-way street. When we got back, he was standing there going ‘Did you get it?’ and I’m like ‘No. Sorry man, I thought I’d killed you.’ It was a bump in the road right there. It was the worst three minutes of my life, driving around that block.”\n\nWhile the movie’s dialogue is about one-third Russian and two-thirds English, Copley could only communicate with Naishuler, who lived in London from age 8 to 14, and maybe two other people on the set. Even an app that translated Russian to English only worked about half the time, resulting in much amusement from the local crew whenever Copley tried to converse.\n\n“Some of them could understand English but not speak it, and you never knew how well,” Copley says. “For example, that same scene with the car, I’d never driven a car through another car and didn’t know how hard I’d have to hit the stationary one. I didn’t know how much I’d have to accelerate, so I asked the stunt coordinator how fast do I drive and he’d be like, ‘Eh, quite fast.’ Then I’m like, ‘How fast do I drive when the stuntman’s holding on the side of the window?’ and he says, ‘Not too fast’ and that’s it.”\n\nAlthough the movie boasts some 1,800 digital enhancements, many of them fell under the category of erasing safety wires and lighting rigs the run-and-gun filming process inevitably caught in frame. “Hardcore Henry’s” endless action scenes, though, were all staged practically.\n\n“As difficult as it was for me, this was way harder for the stuntmen,” Copley points out. “These guys are so trained and get very focused. Then we tell that guy in that Zen-like space, ‘You’re going to also wear this helmet with this camera on in front of your face, and once we set you on fire you’ve got to turn over there and film that other guy who’s doing a full body burn as well, as long as you can until you’re burning too much, then you jump out of the window. Don’t break the GoPro, go put yourself out and then film the other guy running out of the truck on fire.’\n\n“I think this is the most incredible tribute to stunt performers of any film in recent history.”\n\nCopley also thinks “Hardcore Henry,” which actually sees a nifty little sci-fi plot emerge amidst the mayhem, is more than a live-action videogame.\n\n“What we learned was that you can actually do quite a lot of narrative in this format,” Copley explains. “And there’s enormous potential there that we just vaguely touch on in this, because it’s an action movie. If this film does well, I think you’re going to see lots of people try to tell all kinds of stories in this POV format.”"
