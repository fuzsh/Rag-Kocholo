        "text": "In Regarding Henry, Henry Turner, an established lawyer and unforgiving husband is shot twice during a robbery. He is shot in the head and the heart, cutting off some oxygen supply to his brain. Once he awakes from his coma, he really is transformed from a selfish, mean man when he was controlled by his id, to a giving and sweet man, now controlled by his super ego. Henry's natural state is his selfish, id state.\n\nWith any successful business, the boss and management play a very essential part when coordinating a specific task. In a film, the director plays the same role and holds just as much importance. The director is in charge of making “crucial decisions about performance, staging, lighting, framing, cutting, and sound” (Bordwell). At some point during the 1950’s, the French brought forth the term auteur for those directors at the time in Hollywood which they felt had a unique approach to film.\n\nThe art of storytelling is a primary foundation for human communication and understanding. Whether it is through myths — Greek, Roman, Egyptian, you pick — or wives tales or even Grandpa telling his old war stories, stories have power. Through technological advancements in the last 150+ years, there are multiple mediums to tell stories; film being the most potent medium used. Film has the power to not only entertain but enlighten too. Filmmakers have the ability to challenge and manipulate the power of the story through creative resistance; by exploring other elements of storytelling: location, voice, color, angles, rhythm, language, filmmakers can create dramatically different films out of the same story.\n\nHenry also known as “The youth” begins as an egotistical teen that wants to show off to girls while wearing his army uniform so Henry confidently enlisted himself into the war. He slowly starts to doubt himself. He had just heard stories about the famine and the bloody bones sticking out through slits of faded uniforms. “ A little panic-fear grew in his mind. As his imagination went forward to fight, he saw hideous possibility. He contemplated the lurking menaces of the future, and failed in an effort to see himself standing stoutly in the midst of them.” As he had time to Henry fears of the death in battle, so he can already see himself failing already. He tried really hard to prove to himself that he would not run from a battle, but Henry lacked courage. However through the courses of the many battles of the war, he has\n\nAt this point, Henry and is date are welcomed by another very powerful man. This man orders a table ‘down in front’ for the couple and then the camera pans left to show a waiter carrying this table. Though the camera is now not focusing on Henry and this other man, we still hear their voices loud and clear as if they were up close to the camera. This maybe makes the audience keep their attention on Henry because as we can still hear his voice, we know that he will be back on the camera once again soon. When the table is placed down at the front pretty close to the stage, Henry and his girl take their seats. Once they are settled, the girl asks ‘What exactly do you do?’ and he replies, ‘I’m in construction.’ We know quite well that Henry is not in construction, as people would not care to treat an ordinary builder like some royalty in a club. This tops off how effective this scene is. The audience has not been told directly what Henry does for a living, but what they do know, it must be something quite secretive, dark, dangerous and underground.\n\nA long time ago in a galaxy far far away The Movie Brats were at the top of the film industry, producing new blockbusters every year. The Movie Brats were a group of directors who were changing the film industry with their blockbuster movies American New Wave movement in the American film industry. The directors who made the most impact during this time period were no other than Francis Ford Coppola, George Lucas, John Milius, Brian De Palma, Steven Spielberg, Paul Schrader. Now will we only look into these three directors Francis Ford Coppola, George Lucas and also the great Steven Spielberg. All of these directors have created some of the greatest films in the film industry from “American Graffiti, Mean Streets, The Conversation, Jaws, Taxi\n\nIn the film industry, directors have control over the entire production process and shape the film to fit their vision (Creativeskillset.org, 2015). In 1954, François Truffaut took this notion, applying it one step further, in his essay entitled ‘A Certain Tendency in French Cinema’, by saying that directors have complete creative control over the film’s production and that the director is the sole creator. (Nelmes, 2012). Developing this newfound term, auteur theory, coming from the French word ‘author’, François Truffaut came to this conclusion after studying the filmography of famous directors including the works of Alfred Hitchcock and Jean Renoir (Acu.edu.au, 2011). François Truffaut noticed that many elements\n\nThere is no straightforward answer when one asks the question of: “What exactly makes a great director?”. The truth is that it can be an array of different factors, from the director having a distinctive or original way of shooting scene, to him or her having a well-written script. But what separates a great director from an iconic one, is how their films inspires not only the current, but also the new generation of filmmakers. The well-known Quentin Tarantino is one of those iconic directors. Born Quentin Jerome Tarantino on 27 March, 1963, he is arguably one of the most famous/influential modern directors of our generation to such an extent, that his name alone can sell a movie. Just as recognisable as his name, is his directing. Renowned\n\nWith this short but very interesting and informative class I have just scratched the surface of the what it takes to make a full fleged film. It takes much more than I had presumed to make a movie in Hollywood. The number of people that it takes to make a minute of a movie let alone the entire movie was astonishing to me. There are many things that it takes to start making a movie but without an idea of some sort there is no movie to be made."
