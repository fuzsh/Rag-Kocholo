        "text": "COPLEY: It was interesting because I didn't say to anyone, “I have to be Ted the whole time!” But the crew was really into it. They started calling me Ted, and did so throughout the shoot and I just went with it.\n\nThere was so much research available, so much material available to us that really helped put me in his mindset. Our researchers just kept finding stuff for me to read and feed off of - 10,000 pages or so of his own thoughts in which he would psychoanalyze himself and the people around him.\n\nHe was very eloquent and a brutally honest man. Painfully honest about certain things that were going on at the time. So, there was so much material to draw from.\n\nAnd just listening to him speak really helped. When I heard his voice and how different it was from any other version that I've seen portrayed in the media, I was like, “This guy's not how he's being portrayed, he's way more complex.”\n\nHe's energetic and when you listen to his prison interview, he sounds like the guy that you could sit down and have a coffee with. Like he would be an interesting person to talk to and not someone who is going to creep you out in any way.\n\nHe had so many different facets. But then, he would be very uncomfortable with people in different settings.\n\nSo I would say, I just approached it as honestly as I could. I tried to find parallels between his life and my life, in terms of being somebody who was brought up very anti-violence, but intellectually seeing that societies live with this violent underbelly or threat of violence, which is what the police do, which is what the army does.\n\nWe're not evolved beyond violence as much as we like to pretend that we are.\n\nThese were things that I've been interested in my own personal life. For example, why is Hollywood so anti-violence and yet makes so much violent material? Why is Hollywood so anti-gun, but everything's got guns in it.\n\nI’m not making excuses because I have been in my fair share of violent films, but it made me think. It made me think about people watching our movies 2000 years from now and believing that we lived in such a violent society.\n\nORIGINAL-CIN: Yes, but you’re not going to resort to violence to try to make a point.\n\nCOPLEY: No, but clearly something snapped in Ted. He was at peace in nature, away from everything that made him crazy. He described the forest and the animals in the forest as his family. The anger he felt at the trees getting chopped down, that there would be no place for the animals and a road being put through one of his favorite pieces of land, that really made him angry.\n\nORIGINAL-CIN: What was more useful to you, his diaries or speaking to the people who knew him or had communicated with him. Because some of those people are actually in the film.\n\nCOPLEY: That's right. We used a bunch of people who knew him and had meetings with him, including Sherri (Wood) the librarian.\n\nI would say the writings were definitely the most informative because they really were what was going on inside his head.\n\nAnd I think many times the people who encountered him didn't really get to know him well enough to know what was going on inside his mind. So they've got a very one-dimensional view of him. I was talking to them and they would talk as if they knew him, but they really didn’t.\n\nSherri the librarian might have been a bit of an exception, because she did know him and spent the most time with him. She talked for hours when he came into the library. When I asked her what she remembered most about him she said his humor!\n\nShe said, what I miss most about him is laughing. We just used to laugh together, going through files. He was apparently a very funny guy. His brother would talk about his humor as well. His writings were filled with self-deprecating humor.\n\nIt was a fascinating journey, that I can assure you. He was a very complex character. Very extreme. I don't think, I mean, everyone has their views, but I don't think he's crazy. I think he's extreme, which is a difference to me.\n\nORIGINAL-CIN: He was clearly an evil genius. He was Harvard-educated, and then something must have snapped when he went off to go live off the land in the mountains. It had to have been more than just intriguing to play him. Perhaps one of the biggest challenges of your career?\n\nCOPLEY: It was difficult, but I have to say this role came at the right time in my career, when I've had more experience and I guess I was ready for it.\n\nIt was a beautiful environment to be shooting in, and I really tried to embrace the beauty and tranquility around me. I would literally just be sitting next to the water during setups. It was quite meditative out there between takes.\n\nI understand how Ted must have felt living there. Most of the time he was at peace when he was out there, except for the times that he felt outsiders were invading his territory. I realized making this movie that this sense of peace was something that I miss and so it was a very cathartic experience.\n\nIt wasn't a very stressful experience. The worst part of it was dealing with the cold. It was really freezing at times.\n\nORIGINAL-CIN: You actually committed one full year to this project, not taking on any other projects. How hard was it to jump in and out of Ted’s skin so to speak.\n\nCOPLEY: It wasn’t too hard, but there were different stages of growing the beard, and getting in and out of Ted mode was interesting.\n\nTruthfully, what always stayed with me were the issues he was so passionate about. Having done the movie, I really feel enslaved by my tech. And not just me. I watch my young daughter, how she's influenced by what she sees on TV. And her personality is being modeled by that, and what she thinks is being modeled by that."
