        "text": "Lionsgate/Roadside Attractions has released a first-look trailer for their upcoming action flick “Boy Kills World.” A mature satirical fantasy actioner that sees Swedish actor Bill Skarsgård (“John Wick 4”) playing a deaf-mute protagonist (Bill’s brother Alexander sort of played a similar character in Duncan Jones’ cyberpunk thriller “Mute”) who is on a path of revenge in a wild violent sci-fi world that would perfectly fit within an episode of “Rick & Morty.” It debuted last year at the Toronto International Film Festival and hails from German director Moritz Mohr, who is obviously going to be on a lot of studio radars after “Boy Kills World.”\n\nThe rest of the cast of this awesome-looking action pic includes Jessica Rothe, Michelle Dockery, Brett Gelman, Andrew Koji, Isaiah Mustafa, Famke Jensen, Sharlto Copley, and Yayan Ruhian. Also, Boy’s inner dialogue showcased in the trailer is provided by comedian H. Jon Benjamin, who you will likely recognize from the popular Fox cartoon “Bob’s Burgers” and the goofball animated spy series “Archer.”\n\nHere is the film’s official logline:\n\nBill Skarsgård stars as “Boy” who vows revenge after his family is murdered by Hilda Van Der Koy (Famke Janssen), the deranged matriarch of a corrupt post-apocalyptic dynasty that left the boy orphaned, deaf, and voiceless. Driven by his inner voice, one which he co-opted from his favorite childhood video game, Boy trains with a mysterious shaman (Ruhian) to become an instrument of death and is set loose on the eve of the annual culling of dissidents. Bedlam ensues as Boy commits bloody martial arts mayhem, inciting a wrath of carnage and blood-letting. As he tries to get his bearings in this delirious realm, Boy soon falls in with a desperate resistance group, all the while bickering with the apparent ghost of his rebellious little sister.\n\nThis isn’t the only big action project starring Skarsgård, as he’s also leading Lionsgate‘s remake of “The Crow” from director Rupert Sanders (“Ghost In The Shell”) that will be heading to theaters this summer on June 7. After taking over the release date of “John Wick” spinoff “Ballerina” it was pushed to June 6, 2025, as there are additional reshoots that are being planned for later this year.\n\n“Boy Kills World” will be unleashed on April 26 in theaters and you can watch that aforementioned trailer below.\n\nSOURCE: LIONSGATE/ROADSIDE ATTRACTIONS\n\nNeill Blomkamp is back to making movies after a hiatus after multiple projects not coming together (Alien 5, RoboCop Returns, Greenland), focusing on his Oats Studios shorts, and attempting to put together a new original project, Inferno.\n\nThe filmmaker is currently developing District 10, a sequel to his debut film District 9. That isn’t the only sci-fi project he wants to return to explore. While promoting his new movie Demonic, he spoke with The Playlist on their podcast and briefly voiced his desire to return to the world of Elysium.\n\n“I would love to do more films in the world of Elysium. I love the setup of that world. The world that it puts forward is very interesting to me.”\n\nELYSIUM – In the year 2154, humanity is sharply divided between two classes of people: The ultrarich live aboard a luxurious space station called Elysium, and the rest live a hardscrabble existence in Earth’s ruins. His life hanging in the balance, a man named Max (Matt Damon) agrees to undertake a dangerous mission that could bring equality to the population, but Secretary Delacourt (Jodie Foster) vows to preserve the pampered lifestyle of Elysium’s citizens, no matter what the cost.\n\nWe already have idea what he’d like to tackle in follow-up.\n\nIn 2016, Neill Blomkamp mentioned to Empire the idea of revisiting the Agent Kruger character in a low-budget spinoff, a violent mercenary (played by District 9’s Sharlto Copley) that is hired to do the dirty work for Elysium. He eventually turned into main antagonist of the original film once Jodie Foster’s character was killed-off.\n\n“I did ask [Media Rights Capital?] who paid for Elysium, I was like ‘what if you did a lower budget of this where Kruger is the lead character and is absolutely non-arc, don’t expect the character to to arc, he just doesn’t, he just does a bunch of shit that’s awesome’ and he was like ‘that does sound like that could be cool.'”\n\nIt’ll be interesting to see if he’ll tackle a Kruger-focused prequel or a direct sequel.\n\nYou can listen to that full interview below.\n\nSOURCE: THE PLAYLIST\n\nFans of Neill Blomkamp’s debut film District 9 have been patiently waiting for a sequel as the end of original film finished on a cliffhanger on the promise of Wikus being transformed back into a human.\n\nThe filmmaker has revealed on Twitter that they’ve started work on the sequel’s script with himself, his wife Terri Tatchell (co-wrote the original) and Sharlto Copley working on it.\n\nIt’s unknown at this point if Peter Jackson’s WingNut Films or Sony Pictures will be involved. We know that Neill had a falling out with the head of Sony Pictures, Tom Rothman, over the failed film adaptation of Halo when Tom was the head of 20th Century Fox. Blomkamp stopped working with Sony Pictures conveniently around the same time Rothman joined the studio and attempted to make Alien 5 at Rothman’s former studio 20th Century Fox.\n\nDISTRICT 9 – Thirty years ago, aliens arrive on Earth — not to conquer or give aid, but — to find refuge from their dying planet. Separated from humans in a South African area called District 9, the aliens are managed by Multi-National United, which is unconcerned with the aliens’ welfare but will do anything to master their advanced technology. When a company field agent (Sharlto Copley) contracts a mysterious virus that begins to alter his DNA, there is only one place he can hide: District 9.\n\nSOURCE: NEILL BLOMKAMP"
