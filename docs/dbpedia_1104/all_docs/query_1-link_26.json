        "text": "Starring Sharlto Copley and directed by Neill Blomkamp.\n\nRated R for bloody violence and pervasive language.\n\nHave you heard the hype for this movie? It's pretty thick thanks to an innovative marketing campaign and crazy media blitz in the last couple weeks - including a ton of critics giving it the 'MUST SEE' branding. After being excited for this film a long time ago BEFORE all the new attention that was paid to it, I was still extremely excited to see it. I was not disappointed. This is a must-see movie.\n\nDistrict 9 is the story of aliens from outer space where their ship randomly stops working over the city of Johannesburg. Eventually the city sets up a refugee camp for the aliens which turns into a slum called District 9. The plot centers around a man played by Sharlto Copley that is required to serve eviction notices to the aliens and move them to a new location away from the city.\n\nThe movie has intense layers of emotion and political commentary mixed with the obvious thriller/sci-fi/action that the trailers suggest. It all fits relatively nicely together by being grounded by lead actor Copley. Copley is a wonder in this film, especially since it is his first time acting in a film. The emotional content and the political messages are all centered around his character and without the powerful performance he delivers, the movie would fall flat. Copley has a fine future ahead if he can continue to land roles that take advantage of his skills. Other than Copley, the movie stars mostly CGI aliens that look like big bugs. They don't really talk except in 'alien' speak and as such you read what they say - this is pretty ingenious way of making the flick as it cuts out a budget for voice actors and the design of the aliens practically hides their mouth so matching what they say to noises is not as time consuming, thereby cutting more budget on something very simple.\n\nDistrict 9 was made for 30 million on things like this and still looks like a 100 million box office spectacular effects driven thriller. Since I didn't have a chance to write this review till after the opening weekend - mainly because I watched it a couple times - I have the opportunity to let you know that District 9 did above expectations at the US Box Office and pulled in 37 million on it's opening weekend. That means a profit for a starless independant flick with a good story and first time director. It's against all odds that it did this well, but should help to open more doors to get other original independant flicks in the US Theatres. And I sure hope so - it's these type of flicks that are the most exciting to watch as you really do experience something new at the movies.\n\nThis film is spectacular and you should go out and see it now. It is a bit violent and can be pretty disgusting in parts, but wading through that, an emotional story of love and understanding opens up. Plus, it keeps you on the edge of your seat and kicks you in the butt - GO EXPERIENCE THIS EPIC PIECE OF CINEMA TODAY!! I highly recommend it."
