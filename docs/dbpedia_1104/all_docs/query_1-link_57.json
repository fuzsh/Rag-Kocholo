        "text": "Under the cut contains an interview about his upcoming movie Elysium including his upcoming projects (Maleficent) and plans, A Europa Report Review plus the current Rotten Tomatoes rating so far, and new Open Grave Stills with an official synopsis.\n\nSharlto Copley is an actor, producer and director from Johannesburg, South Africa. His most recent role was that of Murdock in 2010′s A-Team. On August 9, he’ll be filling the role of “Kruger” opposite Matt Damon in Neill Blomkamp’s sci-fi action film, Elysium.\n\nWhat can you tell me about Elysium?\n\n(Laughs) “I’m supposed to keep most of it a secret. I’m never quite sure what I can say and what I can’t say, but it’s really cool. Can I say that? It’s a great summer action movie that has deeper themes and issues going on in it. In a way, it is similar to District 9.\n\nYou play Kruger; what can you tell me about your character?\n\n“Well, Kruger is the villain of the movie. He is trying to stop Matt Damon’s character from getting onto Elysium. He could be described as a futuristic black ops soldier. The kind of person you would drop behind enemy lines and have them living amongst the enemy until he is activated for a specific mission. But, unfortunately for him, he has to live on earth (which is not the best environment in the movie because it has become a real slum) and wait until he is activated for a mission.”\n\nThis is the second time you have worked with Neill Blomkamp. What is he like as a director?\n\n“Neill is fantastic, especially this time, for this movie. Neill had said he wanted to stay close to the script. I improvised parts of my dialogue in District 9. This time, Neill said he wanted to keep it as close to the script as possible because we were shooting in a much more structured way. So, day one I arrived and was sticking to my lines, and the other actors that I was working with started to improvise and I said, ‘What’s going on? She’s not sticking to her lines.’ Neil said, ‘I’ve decided to relax that,’ and so I went totally off my lines and improvised most of the dialogue. I think most of the big moments in this movie are the improvised moments.”\n\nAs an actor does that present some chaos on the set?\n\n“No, because in this case I‘m really the only one doing that at an extreme level and still sticking to the structure and acting on cue. I would basically be given a starting line that everyone would be aware of. My guy is not a big talker anyway. He is more of a doer than a talker.”\n\nDo you still own your own production company?\n\n“I do.”\n\nSo what do you have going on there?\n\n“I’m working on a couple of projects that I’m writing myself, but nothing that I would want to talk about at the moment. I’m just getting excited about getting a few things going. The last thing I was involved in at full force was the Judge Dredd movie, which was shot in Cape Town. I was involved in production of it in South Africa. I’m in development on four different projects, but I’m really not ready to talk about them at the moment.”\n\nCan you compare what it is like working behind the scenes with working in front of the camera?\n\n“I find working in front of the camera, overall, just a lot more fun and easy. When you work behind the scenes, you are trying to control something that you can’t really control. When you’re producing, you are really trying to steer an uncontrollable beast. With acting, you just work within the framework they give you, and you just do the best you can within the structure of the scene. So I find acting very enjoyable. But, behind the scenes, in a way, you have more creative control. It can be more fulfilling, but also more stressful.” (Laughs)\n\nHow difficult is it to film a movie with a lot of special effects?\n\n“Now, I enjoy that. I think the effects in this movie (Elysium)are unbelievable. They really outdid themselves in that respect; it’s such a big part. I just don’t like it when effects are done badly. But I think it’s incredible what they can do with special effects, and I certainly try to embrace them as much as I can from a performance point of view.”\n\nDo you do any of your own stunts? Is there a lot of stunt work in this movie?\n\n“There are a lot of stunts and a lot of fighting. Matt and I did a lot of training, both fighting and physical training for the scenes that we had. We are in these echo suites and they were heavy and it took its toll on us. It really keeps you in the right frame of mind when you’re fighting. Next time, I just want them to make stuff a little lighter.” (Laughs)\n\nAs a child, you were a big fan of the A-Team and then you got to play Murdock as an adult. Was he your favorite as a child, also?\n\n“Murdock was my favorite character. He and B.A. Baracus were my two favorites. We used to say you can’t really like one without the other. That is what was so fun on the A-Team movie; Rampage and I got to play those two characters and bring them to life again. It made that process so much fun. I must say working with Matt [Damon] was a lot of fun, too, because it was just playfulness. Matt had done a South African film called Invictus. So, Matt, in addition to being a great actor, does a great South African accent, and he kept doing my lines. So, I would be standing there preparing for something and be really focusing on my character and he would say, ‘Sweet man coming,’ which is one of (my) lines in District 9 (Copley played the role of Wikus Van De Merwe). And every now and then I would hit him with the line, so we would spend a lot of time doing that.”\n\nDo you ever find it difficult to switch up accents?\n\n“I enjoy doing different accents! It’s been my thing since I was very young. I was always playing around with voices and playing around with characters. Now that I’ve gone seriously into acting I take pronunciation very seriously and try to be as accurate as I can. I find there is stuff you can sort of get away with, and then there are times when you have to be as technically perfect as possible with the dialect. I try to be as technically accurate as I can, especially when I want the accent to fit with the character. I really enjoy it. It helps me to become someone else.”\n\nWhat is your favorite scene from Elysium?\n\n“My favorite scene would have to be (just because it’s personal to me) when Kruger sings a nursery rhyme. It’s a very famous South African nursery rhyme, and the fact that I got to sing this nursery rhyme in the midst of Hollywood– I’m just really glad for that moment.”\n\nWhich was the hardest scene to film?\n\n“The hardest would definitely be a big fight I have with Matt that was very, very draining.”\n\nKruger is a sort of black opts guy. At any point in the movie does he ever become resentful that he is stuck on earth when he is really working for the other side and could be having a sort of paradise life?\n\n“All I will say is that he does get a little hot under the collar at times about his situation.”\n\nDoes he ever have a change of heart?\n\n“I can’t tell you anything like that.”\n\nIf you had your pick of a favorite type of movie to star in would it be action, drama or comedy?\n\n“It would be either science fiction or fantasy. I like characters that are a little bit larger than life and entertaining to people who go to the movies and want to watch an action figure. Those are the types of characters I like bringing to life.”\n\nDoes Murdock (A-Team) have an action figure?\n\n“He does have an action figure, which is amazing. I have the original Murdock and I have myself as Murdock, which just blows my mind because I owned A-Team toys as a child. So, in my office, I have my original Murdock and the new one. It is so surreal.”\n\nSo you took good care of your toys and didn’t destroy them like most boys do?\n\n“You would have to talk to my mother, but I think she would concur that I took great care of my toys.”\n\nSo he was out of the box?\n\n“He was out of the box. I played with him.”\n\nWorking behind the scenes with your production company, what would you rather be doing: the big blockbuster with special effects or a more independent film?\n\n“Again, I would probably go towards the blockbuster. The thing that is key with me is that I like what most people like. My artistic sensibility is keyed in to what is commercial. It’s important to do a character that people like and as much as possible. I try to be in work that people will want to see—that is something that I am passionate about. Genre-wise, what I might choose to produce or direct– I want to believe that it really has a chance of reaching a lot of people. It wouldn’t be an art-house movie. I wouldn’t want to do it because it might explore a certain part of humanity or something like that, for the sake of the art. I want to entertain. This is my primary passion–to try to give people an entertaining experience.”\n\nSo it’s not that you specifically go out looking for the blockbuster, it is that you make good choices?\n\n“I try. With acting, your choices are kind of limited to whatever options are on the table for you at any given point in your career. That’s the advantage of developing your own stuff: you can be more specific about what really moves you. Whereas your choices before were limited to what was at the top of the acting pile (if you know what I mean).”\n\nHave you ever gone out and actually fought for a part?\n\n“Oh yes, absolutely! With Maleficent, for example, I did a screen test and spoke adamantly with my agents to get to Angelina [Jolie]. I had met Angelina about two years prior and I just kind of clicked with her. She was very impressed with my performance in District 9 and said, ‘I hope we get to work together some time.’ I just really resonated with the character in Maleficent and I liked the idea of playing off Angelina. So, I went after that very quickly with a series of complex scenes that I shot myself. For Murdock (A-Team), I shot a series of scenes in my hotel room in Austin, Texas, while we were promoting District 9, and we just improvised scenes in an afternoon. I’m really thinking of putting them online just to show people what it takes and what is involved. I’m thinking of doing that on my Facebook page.”\n\nAside from Elysium, Copley is in post-production on two other movies: Maleficent and Oldboy. He just completed another movie, Open Grave, which will be released sometime before the end of 2013. He is now in pre-production on a 2014 release entitled Chappie.\n\n________________________________________ __________________________________\n\nTwo currently popular strands of genre filmmaking, the low-budget sci-fier and the found-footage thriller, merge to reasonably plausible and impressively controlled effect in “Europa Report.” Meticulously crafted by Ecuadorian helmer Sebastian Cordero and his team, this futuristic tale of astronauts searching for signs of life near Jupiter was ostensibly shot using cameras positioned aboard their spacecraft; their video diaries have been cannily reassembled into something coherent and genuinely compelling on their own low-key terms, if a touch over-earnest at times. Commercially, Magnet’s Aug. 2 release may fall into that unfortunate audience vacuum in which genre trappings and arthouse cool cancel each other out, though its methodical, science-positive approach stands to be appreciated by the curious and discerning.\n\nIt spoils nothing to note that the mission documented here does not end particularly well, as one might expect from a speculative dramatic thriller following a small crew of space explorers into uncharted territory. Yet “Europa Report” refreshingly avoids the usual sci-fi hack-’em-up conventions, not least because the astronauts in question, rather than coming off as another stereotypical bunch of wiseacres, instead have been conceived as quietly intelligent, dedicated individuals with (gasp) an actual aptitude for science. Rather than falling victim to yet another race of bloodthirsty extraterrestrials (a la 2012′s “Prometheus” and last month’s Cannes-preemed “The Last Days on Mars”), they encounter perils of a far more persuasive and unsettling nature.\n\nSet in a post-NASA future when space travel has become a matter of private enterprise, the film concerns the Europa One, a $3.7 billion manned spaceship sent to explore the surface of Jupiter’s moon Europa. (The premise was inspired by the November 2011 discovery of lakes beneath Europa’s frozen surface.) Philip Gelatt’s screenplay adopts a polished faux docu format: Almost every scene is presented as footage transmitted from the ship’s maiden voyage, spliced together with commentary from an on-the-ground commander (Embeth Davidtz), who gravely recalls the moment, about seven months into the mission, when the video feed suddenly went dark.\n\nSpliced by a team of editors into a somewhat achronological but easy-to-follow narrative, the onboard footage reveals how, having lost contact with Earth, the astronauts soldiered on toward Europa, led by mission chief William Xu (Daniel Wu) and navigated by pilot/archivist Rosa Dasque (Anamaria Marinca). The most laid-back member of this otherwise sober, hard-working crew is Engineer James Corrigan (Sharlto Copley), who, shooting video on his own handheld camera, eases us into the wonder and the monotony of deep space. The sense of immersion in the ship’s mundane rhythms isn’t the only passing reminder of “2001: A Space Odyssey”; listen closely for a quick snippet of “The Blue Danube” in an early scene.\n\nWhat overtakes these explorers before and after they land on Europa is fairly simple, even banal, which is partly why it seems so convincing; almost without fail, the crew’s setbacks are rooted in technical malfunctions and human miscalculations, their every step recorded by the omnipresent cameras and the ship’s sophisticated network of display screens. Without contriving any sort of overt threat, the film conveys the terror of deep space as a still, silent void, indifferent to human suffering or survival, and Cordero’s direction maintains an eerie calm even as the astronauts slowly begin to grasp the likely outcome of their mission; they may take risks and make sacrifices on each other’s behalf, but always in cool, levelheaded fashion.\n\nWhile none of the characters are especially individuated, the actors make them as authentic and relatable as they need to be. South African thesp Copley, so memorable as the lead in “District 9,” touches the film’s most poignant notes as a particularly homesick member of the crew, while Romanian actress Marinca, best known for “4 Months, 3 Weeks and 2 Days,” again reveals her ability to command the camera through her silent, watchful presence alone.\n\nThe unfussy internationalism of the cast — which also includes Christian Camargo, Swedish thesp Michael Nyqvist and Polish-American actress Karolina Wydra — represents a slyly hopeful wink at what the future of space travel may hold. Indeed, there isn’t a whiff of satire to “Europa Report,” whose upbeat vision of global cooperation and sincere belief in the life-changing possibilities of space exploration at times skirt the boundaries of naivete. Still, unapologetically pro-science films are sufficiently rare as to make this one’s earnestness seem all the more refreshing.\n\nThis science-minded approach extends to the film’s formal rigor and extraordinary level of detail, courtesy of production designer Eugenio Caballero (who won an art-direction Oscar for “Pan’s Labyrinth”), whose sterile-yet-functional conception of the ship’s interiors has been brilliantly integrated with the f/x work supervised by John Bair; the occasional roughness of the visuals, such as the slightly pixelated images captured on Europa’s surface, feels consistent with the built-in technical limitations of the premise. The editors carve a clear enough path through d.p. Enrique Chediak’s extensive camera coverage, at times using quick cuts and split screens to playful effect, and Bear McCreary’s fine string-based score is aptly underplayed before coming resoundingly to the fore during the closing credits.\n\n________________________________________ ________________________________________ ____\n\n(Note: I had to google translate this from Italian so I apologize for the broken English)\n\nOpen Grave arrives in theaters Wednesday, August 14, Italy distributed by Eagle Pictures, Open Grave, the mysterious horror of the summer that will jump out of the chair even more adventurous viewers. The film, directed by Gonzalo López-Gallego , tells the story of a man who woke up in a mass grave surrounded by inert bodies, must take into account its tragic situation. How will it be finished in that horrible place? Who killed all those men? The answer to this question may be late in coming. Jonah, the protagonist ( Sharlto Copley ), can not remember how and why he ended up in the mass grave. When he manages to get out, he runs into a hut, where he meets five strangers, who, like him, can not remember who they are minimally or not the reason why you are in that place. The six characters are desperate for food and for answers, and discover that they may not be alone. The group, plagued by questions about his fate, he begins to fall apart: the members, in panic, they begin to turn against each other. The only person who might have the answers is \"Brown Eyes\" ( Josie Ho ), a girl that suit their situation knows much more than they could imagine. A short answers and time, Jonah and his companions warn that to survive in the wilderness must decipher the inexplicable hostility enclosed in the darkness of the abandoned landscape.\n\nSOURCE 1 2 3 4\n\nThat interview make me more excited about Elysium than before, I think I might die when he starts singing the nursery rhyme in the film\n\nHonestly Europa Report is a like-it or hate-it type of film, I thought it was okay but its definitely not for everyone, I believe what truly hurts it from being great is its non-linear story line.\n\nAnd damn, those biceps, that's all I have to say"
