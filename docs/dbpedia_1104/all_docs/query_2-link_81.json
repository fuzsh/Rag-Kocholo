        "text": "Economic gap builds dark Eden\n\nBy John Beifuss\n\n\"Elysium,\" like much quality science fiction, is not so much a portrait of another world as an exaggerated picture of our own.\n\nWriter-director Neill Blomkamp has taken note of the growing economic gap between the world's have and have-nots and made it literal by imagining a \"diseased, polluted and vastly overpopulated\" future Earth that has been abandoned to the so-called 99 percent while the privileged 1 percenters live in security and luxury on the ring-shaped orbiting \"habitat\" of Elysium, named for the Eden-like afterlife of Greek mythology.\n\nElysium is green, clean and tranquil; Earth is dusty, brown and chaotic, a grim slum of aggressive android police, robot parole officers and public transportation systems as unreliable as our own. \"It's a giraffe, they lived in Africa,\" says a little girl, reading from a picture book, and the past tense is tragic.\n\nThe movie's evocation of the impoverished Los Angeles of 2154 ? imagine the world of \"Wall-E,\" but with people ? is so convincing, precise and matter of fact that my dread of the letdown of an overextended action finale actually interfered with my enjoyment of the terrific first half of the film; I was like a kid who can't enjoy dinner when he's afraid prunes will be served for desert. Sure enough, the movie's final act, with its unnecessary fight scenes and overcomplicated ticking time-bomb plot devices, is a disappointment. Even so, \"Elysium,\" like its title environment, is far above the heads of most of the competition.\n\nBlomkamp's much-anticipated follow-up to 2009's sleeper Best Picture nominee \"District 9,\" \"Elysium\" casts Matt Damon as Max (the name is certainly an homage to director George Millers' post-apocalyptic hero, Mad Max), a shaven-headed, tatted-up orphan who has abandoned a notorious criminal career \"You used to be a legend, and now what?\" asks a former collaborator (Diego Luna) for the steady if inadequate paycheck of an assembly-line worker in a defense industry plant that relies on the paranoia of Elysium's coddled citizens to ensure its profits.\n\nBlomkamp and his fellow wage slaves are thematic kin to the subterranean workers in Fritz Lang's \"Metropolis\" (1927), another science-fiction tale that literalized the notion of an upper and lower class. They have no labor rights (\"All workers must reach weekly quotas,\" we hear a robotic voice intone), and health care has been all but eliminated. When Max is poisoned by radiation in a work accident that could have been avoided but for his boss' orders, he is given some pills, told he has five days to live, and fired.\n\nThis death sentence inspires Max to return to lawbreaking to reach Elysium, where he can be cured. Fitted with an exoskeleton, he agrees to be pull a \"data heist\" for Spider (Wagner Moura), a local criminal/revolutionary; he also eventually agrees to help his longtime friend and fellow orphan Frey (Alice Braga), a nurse whose young daughter is dying of leukemia.\n\nThe violent heist attracts the unfortunate attention of Elysium's hard-line defense secretary (Jodie Foster), who is plotting a coup against the orbiting world's \"soft\" president, with the help of surveillance systems the NSA would envy. She looses her secret weapon on Max, a brutal mercenary (Sharlto Copley, showing his versatility after his nerdish star turn in \"District 9\") whose comic-book aggression seems somewhat out of place in this otherwise relatively \"realistic\" fantasy.\n\nBlomkamp is from South Africa, and \"District 9\" ? a commercial as well as critical hit ? was a parable of apartheid, distorted through a science-fiction lens. \"Elysium\" is similarly political, and similarly sympathetic to the disenfranchised: The movie is an immigration story and a parody of the current battle over border safety. Spider attempts to smuggle people to Elysium aboard small space shuttles, but the defense secretary has no qualms about shooting down these \"illegals\" in their \"undocumented ships,\" even when the crafts contain women and children. Those who oppose such uncompromising measures have been weakened by political \"sickness,\" she says.\n\n\"Elysium\" suggests that indifference rises with insulation ? that the higher one goes up the social scale, the more likely one is to lose interest in the welfare of those below. As is often the case in popular cinema, a taste for classical music ? the people of Elysium listen to piano concertos and string quartets ? and a precision of diction are associated with those who are aloof and sinister, while those on the ground, the honest and dirty, prefer booming beats and slang.\n\nTechnically, \"Elysium\" is an unqualified success. The effects and production design lack the cartoonish unreality that characterizes too much digital imaging; all this only makes the last half-hour or so particularly disappointing.\n\nLate in the movie, Max remembers ? and Blomkamp repeats ? significant scenes from the early part of the film; Blomkamp seems to think viewers can't remember an hour into the past (unlike most of this summer's would-be blockbusters, \"Elysium\" is under two hours long). In a painfully clichÃ©d gimmick, flashbacks are announced with bright bursts of light and whooshing sounds. But if \"Elysium\" isn't as startling as \"District 9,\" it confirms Blomkamp's status as a filmmaker with a valuable voice and vision."
