        "text": "If Hollywood hadn’t witnessed Sharlto Copley’s rise to fame firsthand, there’s a good chance the cynics would have assumed some screenwriter had whipped the whole thing up. For the better part of almost two decades Sharlto ran a production company through which he met director Neill Blomkamp. The man who would, in 2009, turn Sharlto into a global star by casting him as Wikus van de Merwe in “District 9.”\n\nThat little South African film ended up taking Hollywood by storm, snagging a Best Picture Academy Award nomination and revealing the quirky, capable and endlessly endearing actor to be a true hidden gem.\n\nIt didn’t take long for Hollywood to get Sharlto’s uniqueness on the big screen again, wooing him to play Murdock in the “A-Team” reboot. As that movie gets a nationwide push today, PopWrap caught up with Sharlto to talk about his personal Murdock memories, what this introduction to big budget filmmaking has been like and if Wikus could return in “District 10.”\n\nPopWrap: When did you find out they were remaking “The A-Team?”\n\nSharlto Copley: I heard it was being remade at the same time I heard they wanted me for Murdock, or that they were extremely interested in me for Murdock. I was concerned it would be a cheesy remake because I loved the show so much – particularly Murdock. He had such an influence on me as a child, that I couldn’t resist the opportunity to play it.\n\nPW: What was it about the script that changed your mind once you read it?\n\nSharlto: I have to be honest, it wasn’t the script that grabbed me. It was Joe [Carnahan, director] who has done “Narc,” and finding out Liam Neeson was attached. I thought, “wow, that’s damn interesting casting.” I did not actually respond to the script really, especially since Murdock wasn’t written in that script the way he comes across in the final film.\n\nPW: How was he different?\n\nSharlto: They had taken out all the fun stuff about him changing accents, doing impersonations and stuff like that. I wanted to show Joe what I could do with the character, so I shot a couple little videos in my hotel room called Things That Could Happen To Murdock. That was more in line with the original Murdock – different voices, crazy comedic stuff, almost caricature-ish if you will and I said to Joe, if you’re prepared to do it like this and leave me room to improv, I would love to do it.\n\nPW: I had a feeling a lot of your stuff was improv — did your favorite make the final cut?\n\nSharlto: It did. The “Braveheart” thing was totally made up. Joe suggested it to me when I saw me doing the Blue Man Group bit and he said, “what about ‘Braveheart?’” And I actually knew the speech so I was like, “let me do the end of that.” The two of us had a great backwards and forwards on set, and that ended up being my favorite thing in the movie. Which actually almost didn’t make it in. But it tested well, thank god, and they left it in.\n\nPW: What was it like going from a very small production on “District 9” to this supersize Hollywood movie?\n\nSharlto: This was a whole new world for me. I actually stayed in my trailer for the first four nights with Liam Neeson because it was so cool. The two of us camped out in the desert in British Columbia because it was over an hours drive to the motel, and our trailers were nicer than the hotels. He’d barbecue outside of his trailer every evening and I turned my trailer into a petting zoo. I had a lemur. Apparently this is what it’s like on a big budget movie.\n\nPW: What was the most surprising thing for you going from indie to blockbuster?\n\nSharlto: I was surprised at how involved the studio was in very small decisions. I didn’t expect a studio to get involved in little decisions like hairstyles or wardrobe. At times you felt like you were making a really big commercial. I was quite surprised by how mechanical the whole process could be was at times. Like a system that has people acting like cogs in the wheel as opposed to having real creativity happening all the time, which is interesting to me. But we were still able to do creative and exciting work.\n\nPW: You mentioned earlier that the producers approached you for the role, what’s it like being sought out like that?\n\nSharlto: That is an awesome blessing. It’s something I’m very grateful for. I have a lot of respect for the Hollywood engine even though at times you can wish it were more creative. Overall it tends to respond to what audiences reposed to. For me, the biggest shift is that I’m an actor now instead of a behind the scenes guy. But I am headed back on the other side.\n\nPW: Anything you can talk about?\n\nSharlto: I can’t really tease. It said in the press that I was going to be in “I am Number Four” while we were trying to work out schedules still, so I’ve learned a new Hollywood lesson – to be very quiet about what you’re thinking about doing. Sorry to get all secretive on you [laughs].\n\nPW: There has also been rumors of a “District 9” sequel called “District 10” — but it would seem that your character Wikus couldn’t return given the ending.\n\nSharlto: I always find it interesting that everyone has jumped on that theory that it’s Wikus at the end. It’s interesting everyone just assumes that is Wikus, which I find quite funny. If that’s how you see it, I won’t question it.\n\nPW: How do you see it?\n\nSharlto: No comment. You’ll have to stick around [laughs]\n\nPW: So theoretically “District 10” could open up on the same shot “9” ended on and the camera might pan right and we’d see a human Wikus sitting there?\n\nSharlto: Anything is possible man. Here’s what I’ll tell you, anything Neill does wouldn’t be lame. He’d never make a cheesy sequel. Whatever choice he makes would be creative or exciting.\n\nPW: Are you excited about returning to your more indie roots with the next project?\n\nSharlto: If I had to choose, I would probably go the independent route. Especially since I think they can still be commercial. But it’s fun in the big Hollywood engine too. It’s less stressful, it’s less demanding – a lot of other people carry the weight. It’s not sitting on you in the same way. It’s not sitting on anybody in the same chain. It’s a very different beast.\n\n“The A-Team” is now in theaters\n\nPhoto: Twentieth Century Fox"
