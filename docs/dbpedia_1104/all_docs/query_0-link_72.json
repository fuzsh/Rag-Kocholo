        "text": "I have tickets to tomorrow night's Ultimate Fan Experience pre-show. I am cautiously stoked for this. Look nauseating.\n\nDid you see it? How was it? Nauseating?\n\nI'm hoping to go this weekend, but will probably see Everybody Wants Some first so I dunno if I'll have time.\n\nYes I saw it. I enjoyed it thoroughly. It wasn't nauseating due to its first person perspective, although it definitely is jarring. It's relentless and hilarious, I am personally glad it didn't take itself too seriously. Highly recommend, and side note: I saw this with a buddy of mine and we were drinking before the film. Not sure if that was a prerequisite, but not a bad call on our parts.\n\nI feel sort of bad, me and my buddy were 2 of 6 people for the prescreening. In a weekend of new releases up against The Boss and Evereybody Wants Some, I hope people decide to bring Henry into their lives. Raucous good fun.\n\nMidnight Special and Demolition are also going wide this weekend. Kinda crowded at the box office, but I think this film might have a specific enough demographic to do decent. I'll definitely be seeing it on a big screen at some point soon.\n\nI saw this movie this weekend and if you are a fan of FPS video games then I highly recommend it. It's brainless fun so don't go in expecting much of a story or anything else besides nonstop action, cursing, and a gratuitous nudity segment. The movie doesn't take itself seriously and if you don't as well, you should enjoy it immensely. It's very un-PC and very immature so be forewarned. I did feel a little queasy at one point, but not for long and I get very bad motion sickness on rides so I don't think it should be a big problem for most people.\n\nI thought this was dope.\n\nIt's not a great film, but they do some really neat stuff with the camera... and it's basically all you could really want from an action flick. I thought the POV thing would wear thin pretty quickly, but they did a good job of sustaining interest for the 90+ minutes. Kinda seemed like a mix of Crank and The Raid (two movies I thoroughly enjoy).\n\nSaw this lastnight. It was such a fun little bastard! One of my friends had to leave halfway through though because he was feeling nauseous from the camera movement and everything, ha. But I loved it. It's probably not one I'll wanna see again anytime soon, but it was a lot of fun and a nice twist to the typical action movie."
