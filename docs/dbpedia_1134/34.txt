Grammy Award Mixing Engineer

I’m a Mixer, Producer, Recording Engineer, Front of House Live Engineer and Mastering Engineer with over 20 years of international experience. My broad knowledge of all facets of the recording and live process allows me to offer professional mixes with fast turnarounds and high-quality mastering at a competitive price. Additionally, my Studio has top-notch equipment, hence I deliver results quickly without sacrificing quality.

Originally from Brazil, I’ve worked with the most well-known Brazilian artists for over 15 years. Gilberto Gil, Lenine, Ana Carolina, Gabriel o Pensador, Roberta Sa, Cidade Negra, Lulu Santos and Marina Lima are a few of them. Subsequently, in the USA I started out as Personal Engineer and Mixer for Itaal Shur who wrote the song “Smooth” with Rob Thomas, performed by Santana, Grammy’s Song of the Year in 2000.

During this time, my work in-studio and live counts with an array of artists such as Ricky Martin, Draco Rosa, Santana, Jewel, Chick Corea, Stanley Clark, Sergio Mendes, Imani Coppola, Lucy Woodward, Eric Zayne, Fred Schneider of the B-52s, Sugar Ros, Maria Rita, Angelique Kidjo, Bebel Gilberto, Omar Rakim, Aloe Blacc, Q-tip, Candace Springs and Les Nubians.

In addition to the above, I was nominated for a Latin Grammy in 2016 for Best Pop Contemporary Album with Larrisa Luz.
