        "text": "Information has never been more easily accessible than today: with mobile connectivity and fast-speed internet everywhere, virtually all known data is a couple of taps away. Encyclopedic information of absolutely all fields of knowledge is free to be found. Maps and all sorts of location systems are all equally available. However, to form an opinion about a foreign land, people rely not only on the news but also on the specific depictions that entertainment media provide: music, gaming, films and series, and the internet. Such images would paint a rather incomplete picture, as their intention to be accurate is more often than not put aside in favor of perpetuating stereotypes that are more easily distinguishable for a lot of different reasons.\n\nBrazil is a very good example of such a phenomenon. Throughout its history, the South American nation has had a struggle with being truly recognized by the outer world. It was only during the early 20th century that Brazil started to establish itself as a modern nation, and coincidentally at the same time the radio and the cinema became a reality for the average person.\n\nFor a lot of reasons, the local and foreign entertainment industries started propagating an image of Brazil that had a clear intention of simplifying all of the countries’ plural cultural expressions, through the use of well-known stereotypes.\n\n“Entertainment makes itself possible only by insulating itself from the totality of the social process, making itself stupid and perversely renouncing from […] the inescapable claim of any work, even the most trivial: in its restrictedness to reflect the whole” (Adorno and Horkheimer, 2002, p. 115-116).\n\nThe case of Brazil also expands on Adorno and Horkheimer’s view of the culture industry as opposed to mass media, with the consequences of having a whole country reduced to a cultural product. It leads to its last consequences the idea that “[the culture industry] is interested in human beings only as its customers and employees and has in fact reduced humanity as a whole, like each of its elements, to this exhaustive formula” (Adorno and Horkheimer, 2002, p. 118). It provides a clear case of how mass media can shape the representation of a country from inside out when a whole culture is reduced to a cultural product.\n\nThis essay will focus on some of the images that Brazil has spread to the world through its portrayals on music, film, and TV over the last century. It will also propose and discuss how stereotypes were established and maintained, and what were the reasons and consequences of such depictions.\n\nThe country of the future had music\n\nBrazil was first a colony, then a monarchy, and in 1889 became a Republic, only one year after abolishing slavery. During this First Republic, Brazil’s musicality flowered. Samba had already passed its embryo stages as a mix of genres as diverse as Austrian polka (reflecting the previous Brazilian aristocracy that financed the music halls) and Angolan lundu – one of many traditions brought by the huge slave population. A rich musical tradition developed independently from Europe – the Brazilian people organically developed a multitude of rhythms derived from the varied background of its individuals.\n\nMany rhythms were being developed in different parts of the country, either as new manifestations of African or indigenous traditions or as brand new genres as different as maxixe, modinhas, baião, forró, frevo, maracatu, coco, moda de viola, música sertaneja, among others. All these new ramifications would develop independently and eventually become what is now referred to as “Brazilian music”, an expression always at risk of not including all the distinct styles it’s supposed to encompass.\n\nWeek of Modern Art of São Paulo posters, 1922, Prefeitura de São Paulo\n\nThe Week of Modern Art in 1922 proposed a modern Brazilian identity molded by a mix of Brazil’s own indigenous cultural traits and manifestations with European, African, and Asian influences. Oswald de Andrade, one of the most respected modernist poets of Brazil, published in 1928 the Cannibal Manifesto: a metaphoric manifesto in which he proposed that, just like the cannibal indigenous tribes that allegedly lived in Brazil before the Portuguese arrived, Brazilian art forms should also eat all their “enemies” and thus make them into their own totems – effectively absorbing all the influence from outsiders and creating something new from it.\n\nBrazilian artists were growing increasingly eager to find new national symbols. Throughout the 1920s, the carnival party, especially in the then-capital Rio de Janeiro, started to become an original and spontaneous cultural landmark associated with samba. The first samba ever released, Pelo Telefone (“On the telephone”), was composed by Donga in 1917. It was the biggest hit in the Carnival of 1917 and later was recorded by Baiano for the record label Casa Edison (Walsh, 2010, p.27). It was released as a 78 RPM gramophone record.\n\nIn 1928 the carnival party had been established: the first samba school, “Let Them Speak” (Deixa Falar) paraded in Rio. Around the same time, the newspapers started to follow the carnival, reviewing the samba school competitions. This unique, authentically Brazilian party would soon become a national institution, although its Rio version would remain arguably the biggest and most important one.\n\nThe fact that both samba and carnaval became huge in the capital at that time would contribute to its acceptance nationwide, but it was not yet a unifying symbol. It would be impossible to determine exactly why those were chosen to be symbols of Brazil, but those mass cultural manifestations would eventually be turned into a politically-oriented global cultural product.\n\nBrazil as an unexplored Ally\n\nFranklin Roosevelt and Getúlio Vargas in Natal, 1943, Memorial da Democracia\n\nIn 1930 Getúlio Vargas became the president of Brazil. As a populist ruler who wanted to create an uphanistic idea of Brazilianess, he did not take long to start using media to project his ideals to the people.\n\n“In a 1936 interview, Lourival Fontes, director of the Department of Propaganda and Cultural Diffusion (DPDC), insisted on the need for greater government attention to the medium. Fontes argued that in other nations – he was thinking of Italy and Germany in particular – government radio stations already served to create a spirit of national unity [...]: ‘We cannot underestimate the work of propaganda and culture undertaken on the radio... it is not enough to say that radio reaches where the school and press do not, to the farthest points of the country, to the understanding of the illiterates.’” (McCann, 2004, p. 19).\n\nThe government had an active role in the definition of samba as a national musical expression, although in what nowadays can be seen as an obvious whitewashed manner.\n\nIn 1939, Ary Barroso composed Aquarela do Brasil, is a good example of that: an intentional attempt to paint Brazil as the country of samba, it was performed for the first time during a benefit concert at the Municipal Theatre of Rio sponsored by the First Lady, in the presence of the president himself.\n\nThere was a meaningful setback on the way, though: the Department of Press and Propaganda wanted to censor the line terra do samba e pandeiro (“land of samba and tambourine”), for saying it was “derogatory”. Ary Barroso had to speak personally to the censors and convince them to keep the line. In the end, they let it pass. (Cabral, 2016)\n\nIn the same year, it would be released as a 78 RPM by Francisco Alves and the orchestra of Radamés Gnattali. It would grow to become an internationally famous jazz standard, covered in many different versions under the simple name “Brazil” by names like Django Reinhardt, Frank Sinatra, Bing Crosby, and Ray Conniff, among many others.\n\nAmerican president Roosevelt started the “Good Neighbor Policy” around the same time, first with the intention of increasing trade between neighboring countries in the American continent. However, with the onset of war and fear of “losing the West” to socialist or fascist ideologies, the USA made a serious effort to reinforce the friendship between all American nations. Interestingly, Brazil was the only Latin American country to enter the Second World War in 1942.\n\n“In mid-1940s, the Inter-American Development Commision was founded, with the objective of promoting the economic potential of the ‘other American Republics’. In the eyes of U.S. strategists, the economic, social, and military weakness of the Latin American countries was a direct threat to the United States.” (Tota, 2010, p. 26)\n\nImpressions and characterizations in Hollywood\n\nCarmen Miranda poster with fruit in her head, 2019, Amazon\n\nNo person contributed to the image that the world had of Brazil during those years as much as Carmen Miranda.\n\n“Taken to the United States in 1939 by Broadway agent Lee Shubert to sing and dance on Broadway stages, Miranda and her samba were introduced as familiar symbols of an authentic South American identity. [...] In the early 1940s she was already referred to in the press as ‘The Good Neighbor Policy in person’” (Canelo, 2014, p. 66-67).\n\nA great singer, she was comfortable portraying an exotic role that would come to represent Brazilian people in a less than meticulous way. The most famous depiction involves a turban with fruits on top – an image that has no actual relation to any Brazilian ‘character’ but managed to define itself deeply as a generic representation of a tropical, Latin American sign.\n\nIt should be noted that the “woman with fruit in her head” image was created by Miranda herself based on the baianas, traditional women from Salvador, Bahia that dress up with long white dresses and pearls. That provides a more realistic insight into how those stereotypes were many times devised as an unpretentious cultural depiction by a country that was still finding its own image. In 2005, the baianas and their sale of the typical food acarajé received the title of intangible heritage of the culture of Bahia.\n\nModern baiana de acarajé, 2013, Maiana Belo/G1\n\nOvalle (2011, p. 58), also notes that\n\n“Trained as a seamstress and milliner, Miranda exaggerated and maximized the baiana style to create a signature look that complimented her body: she enhanced her petite frame with a turban, used European influences to devise platform sandals that created the illusion of height, tightened the skirt to highlight her hips, and added a surplus of large necklaces and a midriff shirt to further amplify her style.”\n\nCarmen Miranda went on to star in many movies and help build and maintain this “pan-American” image. Such portrayals were met with contempt in the countries depicted in the movies for their grotesque inaccuracy of musical genres, often mixed up completely. In Brazil, she was famously booed during her first concert in Rio, after going to Hollywood, for being a false, “Americanized” characterization. She would, however, sing and release authentic Brazilian sambas.\n\n“Audiences south of the U.S. border easily grasped how GNP representations disregarded the complexity of Latin-American cultures and social reality. Those who perceived their nations as modern, like Brazilian elites, completely refused, and regretted, the picture Carmen Miranda conveyed. [...] Also Argentinean and Cuban audiences deplored the superficial and clumsy representation of aspects of their cultural identity in two of Miranda’s films, Down Argentine Way (1940; Irving Cummings) and Weekend in Havana (1941; Walter Lang). In the case of the former, the careless confusion of tangos and rumbas led to the withdrawal of the film from theaters in Argentina; in the latter, Cubans complained about a mix of Hawaiian and Brazilian rhythms introduced as Cuban” (Canelo, 2014, p. 76)\n\nWalt Disney notably created two live-action animated films, Saludos Amigos (1942) and The Three Caballeros (1944) – released in Brazil under the name “Have You Been to Bahia?”. Featuring examples of samba, they also displayed live-action footage of carnival and beaches. José (“Joe” in the English version) Carioca, a character created by Disney to represent Brazil, is a cool, cigar-smoking parrot who helps Donald with some “black magic” on The Three Caballeros.\n\nOn the main promotional poster released for Saludos Amigos at the time, the only human character displayed is, again, a woman with a colorful dress and a fruit turban. This constant mischaracterization reflects the intent to create a product easy to absorb in favor of accurately representing the cultural aspects of all the countries presented. It could be said that the fact that the name of the movie was a Spanish expression also contributed to the misunderstanding of actual Brazilian culture, although it also presented most other Spanish-speaking countries of the continent.\n\nPromotional poster for Saludos Amigos, 1942, IMDb\n\nThis tendency to group all South American countries when portraying them led to the settlement of an imprecise, mixed understanding of Latin American music that remains today. Current releases of Saludos Amigos portray José Carioca playing maracas on the cover – an instrument not exactly common in Brazilian music, if not absent.\n\nFootball, bossa nova and war tanks\n\nAfter the world war was over, Brazil underwent a series of profound social and political changes. Internationally, it started to become the country of football: as the biggest South American country – the only market where football was popular outside of war-torn Europe –, Brazil hosted the FIFA World Cup in 1950. It was the first one after the 12-years break due to the war. Although Brazil lost to Uruguay in the finals, in 1958 the national squad won the World Cup for the first time, and then again on the next tournament in 1962.\n\nMusically, the country also became more international: in 1959 João Gilberto released Chega de Saudade, developing what would soon be called bossa nova. It was a fresh, mellower form of samba that absorbed a lot of the jazz instrumentation, improvisation, and feel to it. There was a so-called “bossa nova’s pilgrimage to Carnegie Hall” when American record producers and the Brazilian Ministry of Foreign Affairs made efforts to bring this new rhythm to an American audience (Castro, 2003, p. 244-245). Tom Jobim and Vinicius de Moraes made songs like Girl from Ipanema become even more associated with Brazil than the songs previously sponsored by Disney.\n\nThe sentiment of growth and modernism came to a halt in 1964, when a military dictatorship was installed. Aligned with the American side on the Cold War global sphere, the new military rulers of Brazil intended to protect the country against “the communist threat”. After 1968 the congress was closed, and torture, kidnappings, and people going missing became commonplace – but not officially. That regime would last another 25 years with almost absolute media control.\n\nThis censorship was also directed towards foreigners: in 1966 the Brazilian Tourism Agency (Embratur) was created, and it encouraged campaigns that depicted Brazil as a party country, intending to show it as a liberal, democratic land. Images of sunny Rio and Carnival were exploited to exhaustion by a government worried about not letting its dark truth come up.\n\nMilitary tanks in the rally of president João Goulart in Central do Brasil, Rio, 1964, CPDOCJB/Folhapress\n\nWhen Brazil won the 1970 World Cup for the third time, the military were quick in using that on their behalf. President Médici was the first person to congratulate the athletes on national soil, and national chants of unity were used to celebrate the victory. The dictatorship stimulated the creation of football teams and stadiums in places where the military were not met with acceptance. (Praga, 2011, p. 8)\n\nThe MPB (Brazilian Popular Music) artistic movement started to incorporate all of the national arts to create a confrontational, highly artistic, and creative repertoire. Main artists like Caetano Veloso, Gilberto Gil, and Chico Buarque, who are recognized today as amongst the greatest poets of Brazil, were arrested and exiled. All the incredible music that was created during that era was shadowed by the censorship, limiting the access of the population to art but also effectively preventing the world from discovering much of the country’s best musical efforts. A lot of the songs from that era, or at least the ones released in Brazil, coped with the censorship by using intricate metaphors and hidden messages to protest against the dictatorship.\n\nIt should be noted that unlike other South American countries who built many memorials and museums to create a memory of the dictatorship’s negative impacts on society – in special the tortures that were commonplace –, in Brazil not so many initiatives were made in that direction. This may be traced to the national publicity campaign put in operation by the military, painting the Brazil of those decades as a “beautiful country of football”.\n\nIn reality, during the dictatorship years, Brazil was experiencing deep problems that were many times simply not addressed, such as the proliferation of slums in big cities, setbacks in infrastructure and technology, police brutality, and social exclusion of the lower classes.\n\nMachine guns and new, old representations\n\nBrazil slowly walked its way back to democracy, with first general elections for president being held in 1989. When free international trade was made possible again, along with the computer revolution, Brazilians found themselves inserted in the global technological playground.\n\nThe entertainment industry exploded and new styles of music started to be heard. Some of those genres are axé and samba reggae in Bahia, manguebeat in Pernambuco, rap in São Paulo, and baile funk in Rio’s favelas – as Brazil’s communities made up of slums are known.\n\nThe favelas, in particular, soon started to be present in the national cultural output, either in films, music, or TV. The baile funk music was polemic from its beginnings: a mostly electronic genre derived from African traditions and American hip hop and funk, it often features explicitly sexual lyrics.\n\nIn the early 2000s, Brazil’s cities reached record levels of criminality, and national movies started to show that reality. City of God (2003) and Elite Squad (2007) are probably the most famous cases. Both movies displayed favelas in Rio as being drug-ruled places filled with horrendous crimes and morally dubious characters. The importance that baile funk has for those communities was also shown. As they were acclaimed worldwide, they gained unprecedented visibility and kickstarted a new, modern Brazilian stereotype, that somehow still suited Carmen Miranda’s exotic paradise: beach cities filled with lively, different music, but now with the population living in slums on hills.\n\nThat stereotype soon joined the other stereotypes, as it was shown on The Simpsons’ episode Blame It On Lisa (2002, Fox Network), where they go to Brazil: not only Bart puts a fruit turban on and everybody plays football everywhere, Homer gets kidnapped. And no advances in musical depiction: there are conga lines everywhere.\n\nThe next main depiction of Brazil was the 2011 animation Rio, by Blue Sky Studios. Again, it portrayed Rio as a samba paradise, with almost no mention of baile funk. The omnipresent fruit turban made its appearance as well – on a bulldog. The perception of crime as being common also made the script, with criminals from a favela kidnapping a macaw bird.\n\nThis new stereotype seems like it will continue as technology evolves: it was also present on the videogame Tom Clancy’s Rainbow Six Siege (2016), by Ubisoft, that has a favela as one of its maps. Many other games had similar maps. Baile funk music has become famous worldwide by electronic music enthusiasts. At the same time, different Brazilian music keeps reaching an ever-growing number of consumers through audio streaming.\n\nFavela map in Tom Clancy’s Rainbow Six Siege, 2016, Ubisoft\n\nConclusion\n\nIt is important to understand how the stereotypes in media that came to represent the country relate to the actual reality of Brazil.\n\nA land doomed to always be considered “exotic”; a country that, for authoritarian reasons, eventually promoted itself as samba, football, and beaches for too long; a musically opulent nation that fails to change its image of a poor country.\n\nBrazil, a multifaceted nation, is all of that and many other things, too.\n\nThe perception of Brazilian culture by the rest of the world in the last 80 years has been shaped by interesting reasons, and it makes one wonder how influential those reasons are to Brazilian life, people and culture nowadays. Stereotypes are full of hidden meanings – there is a lot we can learn from them if we understand what were the intentions behind their creations.\n\nList of references\n\nAppleby, D.P., 1983.
