I have made many trips to Brazil in the last half dozen years and my husband, Terry, has accompanied me on virtually all of them. He has been a wonderful partner, terrific explorer, great taster, and indefatigable eater. We have visited new places together and returned to old ones. On several of our trips our daughters, Vanessa and Allison, have joined us. We have enjoyed sharing this part of our lives and careers with them, and they have come to love the country and the project as much as we have. All three of these wonderful family members have assisted me in the conceptualization and production of this book. I especially want to thank Alli and Terry for their readings and suggestions through multiple drafts of these chapters. My Brazilian family of Maria José and Tinôco warmly accepted me into their extended family when I was studying Portuguese in Salvador. The meals we ate together are some of the warmest memories I have and, of course, some of the best culinary examples I have experienced. Another long-lasting and wonderful friend in Salvador is Mariaugusta Rosa Rocha, who first taught me to make moqueca and then taught me how to celebrate the Festa de Yemanja in grand style. In Rio de Janeiro many friends got on board to help me learn about food, culture, and family. I want to thank Aparecida Vilaça, José Padilha, and Eduardo Viveiros de Castro, all of whom shared meals, stories, and ideas with me. Each of these friends had suggestions about where to go, what to see, and what to eat. I thank them all. São Paulo is usually our first stop in Brazil and often our last as well. Good friends like Dominique and Richard Gallois are important connections in this city. Clarice Cohn has given us extended hospitality and shown us interesting neighborhoods and restaurants as well as good music. Gabriela Masciola introduced me to the haute cuisine world of São Paulo and the community of exciting chefs and restaurants. I really appreciate her introductions to Alex Atala, Ana Luisa Trajano, and others, and look forward to future adventures with her. My thanks also to Alex Atala for a wonderful tasting meal, fascinating conversation, and his critical study of LeviStrauss’s theories of the cultural basis of cuisine (Atala n.d.). Longtime friend, former student, and “big sister” to my daughters, Leda Martins, welcomed us into her family in Brasília. Her parents, Maria and Julio Martins, gave us extended hospitality. Maria gave me some very important cooking lessons. On the other side of Brasília we enjoyed extended time with Carmen Figueiredo and\n\n– ix –\n\nx • Acknowledgments Rodrigo Balbueno, who also hosted us with warmth and advice. Carmen and Rodrigo had previously lived in Porto Alegre, where they introduced us to the strong ethnic cuisines of the Southern regions and the important churrasco cultures of the South. Brasília has a large anthropological community with many people who like to eat and drink, talk and work. I’d like to thank Esther Katz; Robert Miller and his wife, Carla; Enzo Lauriola; and Patricia Mendonça de Rodrigues for spending time with us, and helping us think about food, identity, and regional differences. Our contacts in Curitiba started with Marcel and Natalia Taminato and spread to their parents, Marie and Hiro Taminato. The Taminatos seem to know everyone in that city and helped us meet and talk with a great variety of people across many ethnic communities and many professions and interests. One contact they made for me was with Ivan Koch who generously spent time describing the food and culture of Paraná, about which he has written extensively. Over many visits to Belém, I have appreciated the experience and knowledge of Louis Forline and his wife, Amália; Paulo Martins; and Ofir Oliveira. I also want to thank Pascale de Robert for pricking my interest in tacaca, Carmen Rial for her hospitality and ethnographic counsel in Florianopolis, and Silvia Martins for her advice and guidance in a wonderful visit to Maceio. Since my husband, Terry, has worked with the Kayapó Indians for fifty years, we have many friends among their villages. I have been privileged to know and learn from Megaron Txukarramãe, Yabuti Mentukitre, Ropni Mentuktire, and Bedjai Txukarramãe. Finally, in Ithaca, I’d like to thank Luciana Ferreira for her help, Marcus Smolka and Beatriz Almeida for the wonderful Brazilian meals they have provided, and the nostalgia we all feel for Brazil on cold winter afternoons. I want to thank CU-Advance and the Department of Anthropology Cornell University for grants to support this research.\n\n–1– Introduction\n\nSea and sun, samba and soccer, and nowadays, coffee, soy, ethanol, and oil: these are the associations that the name Brazil evokes. Visual and sonorous vignettes of a huge and varied nation, they highlight Brazil’s increasing presence on the global stage. Brazil is a nation of continental expanse, and enormous variation in geography and climate and rich diversity in its constituent cultures and languages. Inside its boundaries are distinctive regions, each with its own customs, history, and unique identity. In many cases, food, beverages, dishes, and festivals play important parts in defining the character and cohesiveness that underpins a region’s distinctiveness. Food also plays a part in defining the region’s shared identity with the encompassing nation-state. Among other cultural markers, regions are known for their cuisine, their local ingredients, and the festive occasions that showcase both. While regional foods embody the community, the terroir, and the essence of a place, food is also easily transportable and such comestibles are frequently found outside their region of origin. When they are found in new locations, these transports may convey symbolic properties about the region from which they come and the people who traditionally prepare and consume them. Alternatively, culinary transplants may shed such specific characteristics and take on new symbolic and social properties as components of the new cultural identities in which they become included. In this global age, cuisine is fundamental for understanding notions of identity, regional cohesion, and the presentation of national culture to outsiders. The great Danish chef René Redzepi started exploring the idea of regional identity. He asked “What is a region? What is the sum of the people we are, the culture we are? What does it taste like?” (Kramer 2011). This book explores the role that food plays in the construction of identity on both the regional and national level through key case examples. Through the lens of these studies, I examine these same questions and look at the role that food and food events play as media of social relations, in constructing notions of terroir, and as revealing perceptions of race, ethnicity, class, gender, and other features of identity. Gastro-tourism and culinary exports are features of an increasingly globalized society. Several iconic ingredients and dishes have managed to transcend their regional origins to become integral in national and international perceptions of Brazil. Because my emphasis in this book is on the role of cuisine in the construction of identity, I do not examine the many aspects of food production and exportation that have made Brazil such an important player in the world market (e.g., commodities\n\n–1–\n\n2 • Brazilian Food like soy or beef). To highlight the salient nexus of culture and cuisine, I have selected particular products, some of which have become synonymous with Brazil abroad, such as açaí, and tracked the variation and evolution of their uses, values, and perceptions as they move beyond their points of origin. Each chapter is a study of the way that aspects of regional identity are created and then parlayed into a wider network of meaning and value. The focus is one that should be familiar to many American and Europeans analysts: how does a concept of nationality coexist in a dialectical relationship with notions of regional identity on the one hand and international and global networks on the other? When applied to the topic of comestibles, a further question becomes how does food become an element in both differentiating and uniting a people?\n\nWhy Food? Why Brazil? I first went to Brazil in 1982 with my husband and infant daughter. At the time I was recently returned from fieldwork in Papua New Guinea and was writing my dissertation on the Baining of East New Britain Province, Papua New Guinea. In my analysis of the Baining, food became an increasingly important component of the day-to-day construction of social life and the meaning of sociality. I was therefore thinking about food much of the time and concomitantly exploring and enjoying the, to me, new cuisine of Brazil. The shift from Baining food to Brazilian food took many years during which time I enjoyed teaching a course on the Anthropology of Food and Cuisine and examining food cultures around the world. Only after studying Portuguese to enjoy trips to Brazil with my husband did I become interested in exploring the topic of Brazilian food as a case example of the food and cuisine subjects that I had been teaching for years. I have been visiting Brazil annually for the last six or seven years. This book evolved from this circuitous route. I begin my analysis in Chapter 1 with a discussion of Bahian food, the unique cuisine that first piqued my interest and curiosity about Brazilian regional cuisines.\n\nBrazilian Food Looking first at some general ideas about food in Brazil, one in particular stands out. Brazilians feel food should be satisfying and substantial. These qualities are frequently expressed in the word farta, “filling” or “satisfying.” In conversations with me, numerous Brazilians of different regions and classes mentioned this widespread desire for comida farta (filling food) and spoke of it as a pervasive value. Rice and beans are the principal vehicles of comida farta. Although rice and beans are not the universal basis of a meal in Brazil, most Brazilians feel that a midday or evening meal is incomplete without them. Comida farta in many minds thus tends to mean rice and beans.\n\nIntroduction • 3 The different combinations or configurations by which people meet the need for satisfying food in Brazil, and how these paths meet the expectations of different social groups, is part of the story in this book. We shall begin then with the question of why and whether food can be perceived as fulfilling the quality of farta or not.\n\nComida versus Alimentação Brazilian anthropologist Roberto Da Matta attended graduate school in the United States. When he and his family arrived in Cambridge, Massachusetts, in the early 1960s, it took them awhile to set up a proper household and get used to living in a foreign country. During this time, his young daughter complained that in the United States, they had only comida and not alimentação (Da Matta 1964). Her pronouncement set her father to thinking about the linguistic and classificatory contrast between these two categories. In Brazil, comida refers to the category of foods that are primarily assembled rather than cooked and transformed. Comida is food as nourishment whereas alimentação is a prepared meal. Comida includes sandwiches and salads, fruits and beverages, precisely the sorts of foods that a family with a rudimentary kitchen and a busy schedule might resort to in order to keep the energy up and the children from crying. Da Matta’s daughter, however, missed the heavier prepared dishes of beans and meat, rice and farofa, roasts and stews, fish and barbecue, of her native Rio de Janeiro. For her, the new home was made even more alien than the new country by the lack of familiar and sustaining dishes that she recognized as alimentação. She longed for proper alimentação, which could transform an alien place into a comfortable and familiar home. The food she received in the United States was nourishment, but it failed to impart that quality of well-being that is captured by the adjective farta. She grasped the distinction by recognizing American food as comida but not alimentação (hot, prepared, and appropriately filling). As a child, she missed the familiar dishes that until that point had been an inseparable aspect of home. Food helps to make a place a home, although sometimes one does not realize its powers of transformation until it fails to do so. Many people experience this longing or nostalgia for dishes from “home.” Certain dishes of one’s childhood take on the iconic properties of “comfort food.” This book examines the ways that food helps to make a place a home and how it comes to represent home to those who are “away” from home. Where you are from and what you eat is a significant part of who you are and who are the others that are like you. This is not a unique or new observation; many people, most famously Brillat-Savarin ([1825] 2011), have described how food is part of identity and how one defines one’s identity and ethnicity in part through culinary habits. Much of people’s awareness of this aspect of life and identity, like so many other components of life, only make themselves apparent when they are absent or transformed. Da Matta’s daughter framed her memories of home around food, and Da Matta recognized that even these elementary qualities are a subject for anthropological analysis. Food\n\n4 • Brazilian Food taken out of its mundane context becomes a marked category and one that demands to be consciously considered.\n\nFood and Identity Since we are all “what we eat” in the broad sense, our identities are intertwined with our food. Food has both metaphorical and metonymical properties, so it is an apt medium for creating identity. Certain foods are thought to impart more concrete substantive properties and others more symbolic associative ones. Metaphorically, color and shape, spiciness, smell, and location can imbue foods with properties of health, wealth, longevity, or sexual potency, among other significant qualities. Hot foods are often associated with passion; long noodles are associated with longevity in many parts of Asia; rice is associated with abundance because it has multiple grains so it is thrown at weddings to symbolize fertility; almonds are also associated with fertility, springtime, and rebirth because they are the first trees to flower in the spring; round foods are often associated with money and thus of wealth, and so forth. Associations with the sea or forest, connection to deities, the sound of the name, or a connection to history can give food metonymical properties as well. These associative properties adhere to an object because of their proximity to another entity that has symbolic value. Foods associated with deities convey qualities of potency borrowed from the power of these gods. Foods associated with the forest can embody properties of nature and health beyond mere nutritive qualities; foods associated with the sea impart the essence of water, life, and life-giving salt. In many cases, food takes on the symbolic properties of its place of origin, the manner of its production, the characteristics of the producer, and the shape, color, smell, and habitual uses of its material context. French wine, Italian olive oil, and Russian caviar convey the value of authenticity because of their associations with particular places and traditions. Cold-pressed oil, barrel-aged wine, and organic grain garner status through the methods employed in their production. Homestead cheese, handmade sausage, and artisanal preserves are valued because of the labor that goes into them and the association with tradition that convey a connection to the past. By eating such products people consume more than just the nutritive and substantive properties of the food but also ingest the symbolic properties that give them additional value. This process of absorbing the symbolic properties of food and internalizing them creates a relation of metonymy. Food is never just nutrition, it is always imbued with the values of production, kinship, and status; even mass-produced foods gain symbolic value through the advertisements and branding that promote them, and buying or consuming them imparts some of this value to the consumer. When people recognize these qualities of their food, they often feel that they gain value and potency by ingesting it. They metonymically incorporate these qualities into themselves and thus take on aspects of locality, substance, form, tradition, potency, history, and other symbolic properties that are associated with the food they eat. Not all foods are felt to have such distinctive properties,\n\nIntroduction • 5 and not all the properties of a particular food are imbued with the same content by all consumers, but most people nevertheless are “what they eat” in this sense or become what they want to be by eating it. This aspect of consumption is sometimes associated with a desire to gain status and distinction through what one consumes and how one selects and discriminates among choices. Whether one is choosing white bread over multigrain or multigrain over white, organic over factory-produced meat, or homemade cookies over bakery cookies, the decision is often enveloped in notions of status, identity, and economic constraints (Bourdieu 1984; Barthes 1968; Terrio 1996; Roseberry 1996). Manifesting a discriminating palate gives a person a reputation for knowledge and taste. Eating is frequently a social act, so what you eat and with whom you eat can mark the kind of person you are (or want others to think you are) and augment your status.\n\nThe Taste of Place Food not only takes on the properties of its color, shape, smell, and status, it also acquires particular qualities through its relation to a particular locale. This quality is what the French call terroir, and Amy Trubek (2008) translates as “the taste of place.” Terroir is a complex concept that combines the climate, soil, exposure, sun, wind, and gradient of a particular property with the particular species of a plant or animal, and the techniques and practices of production (the latter including cultural beliefs and practices). All of these characteristics combine to give a product, be it wine, cheese, meat, or coffee a particular taste. That unique amalgamation of factors results in a recognizable taste that reflects the source and care that have gone into the product. The French initially described this essence and have applied it to particular regions and products within their country. Other countries have followed suit, and many of them have protected the products of a particular terroir with legal controls that restrict the right to use particular names to products from that region. While many products reflect a taste of place, not all of them have protected status. Nonetheless, many foods and traditionally made products incorporate the idea of terroir into their essence and people use this special identity to mark them as different from similar products from other places. Foods like açaí, cachaça, tucupi, dendê, and others discussed in this book are imbued with qualities of place even though Brazil has not instituted protected status on any of these ingredients. People ingest these foods and dishes and take on some of the qualities of the place from which they originate. Many people hanker after the food from their home region and see it as part of their identity.\n\nIdentity Identity has many connotations and has been used differently in different social science disciplines. To begin with, identity is a term that people use in practice\n\n6 • Brazilian Food every day. People use identity to describe shared attributes with others, their relations to people, beliefs, activities, and political and social entities (Brubaker and Cooper 2000: 4–5). But identity is also an analytical term. In anthropology, identity has come to mean the sense of belonging to a particular group on the basis of a vague but generally agreed upon set of criteria: usually including religion, ethnicity, sexuality, place of birth or residence, and general social location (class, region, gender, occupation, age, affiliation, etc.). Identity tends to overlap with a number of other forms of classification but does not necessarily share the same boundaries or same implications. Identities are often created, defined, and employed in settings where one or more people are confronted with others who differ in some or many of the criteria held in common throughout the group. Some analysts prefer to describe these processes as modes of identification (MacClancy 2004: 64). Identity and alterity are imbricated in the process of production. Although people often adopt an identity as a marker of themselves and their own cohort, identities are also applied and defined by those who are outside the group. In this book, I look at different levels and types of identity: regional, national, gendered, class, and race. These intersect and overlap but not always in the same way. How people self-identify shifts and changes depending on where they are and with whom they are interacting. As the anecdote about Da Matta’s daughter at the beginning of this chapter suggests, the identity of being Brazilian comes into focus much more clearly when one is comparing oneself to non-Brazilians. In such situations, being a Nordestino (a person from the Northeast of Brazil) or a Carioca (a person from Rio de Janeiro) becomes less relevant when one is no longer in Brazil. Within Brazil, however, being a Nordestino takes on relevance when one is no longer in the Northeast but loses explicit relevance when one is with other Nordestinos. Being a woman or a man may be part of one’s everyday consciousness, but being Jewish or Catholic, or of Japanese or German heritage, may not. Identity shifts between emphasizing sameness and difference. Debates on identity/alterity have been widespread in anthropology, philosophy, cultural studies, and literary criticism (Baumann and Gingrich 2004). To some degree discourses of identity in disciplines like cultural studies have tended to reduce a great many topics to issues of difference. In anthropology, the notion of context becomes very important, and shifting contexts of various sorts, including social, economic, and political forces, can lead to shifting identities and vice versa. In all of these contexts, individuals are always negotiating their own identities vis à vis others and using implicit frames for defining and adjusting relationships. In reality, many relations are fluid and involve cross-cutting types of status and identity. How individuals identify in different situations depends on many factors that can recede or come to the fore in numerous ways. What a food can impart to a person can also fluctuate. The same food can mark one as a Nordestino in general, a hillbilly in particular, an indigenous person, or a sophisticate depending on where and with whom it is consumed.\n\nIntroduction • 7 Brazilian notions of identity are understandably complex but are entwined with associations with region of origin or even one’s parents’ or grandparents’ regions of origin, local residence, occupation, class, race, ethnicity, education, religion, and associations with groups on the basis of elective affinity, such as music, dance, capoeira, soccer, and countless others. Mediating between different groups are relations of status, employer/employee, teacher/student, performer/audience, producer/ consumer, and so forth. These differences take on added salience as connections are formed or broken through family, employment, migration, religion, and other intervening social factors.\n\nDiversity and Equality Brazil is a country with great geographical diversity from temperate zones to the tropics and from the Atlantic Ocean to the foothills of the Andes. Upon this geographical diversity is juxtaposed an even greater social diversity. The popular myth is that Brazil is composed of three “races”—the indigenous people, the Europeans, and the Africans. In reality, there are many more. Brazil, like the United States and many European countries, has received immigrants from around the world, from Japan, China, Lebanon, Portugal, Spain, Italy, Germany, Ukraine, and many Latin American countries. Despite this diversity, the myth of the three races persists. Constructed on top of this myth is the belief that Brazil is a “racial democracy” (Skidmore 1993: 216–17; Skidmore 2010: 76–77; Burns 1993: 323; Reichmann 1999). This idea carries the connotation that Brazilians are free from racial prejudice and that everyone in the country has equal rights to all resources. Although patently untrue, this view insists that it is not racial prejudice that impedes individual success or opportunity but class, instead, which constrains success and bars entrance to opportunities (Skidmore 2010: 76–77; Eakin 1997: 116–17). The popular view of inequality in Brazilian society, in other words, acknowledges that class is an important determiner of status, opportunity, and well-being while mitigating race as a significant factor. Within the denial of racial prejudice, however, lurks the realization that race and color matter. As in a number of Latin American countries, miscegenation is considered an important social phenomenon in Brazil and a key to creating a more homogenous society. Within the notion of racial democracy, the process of “whitening” (embranquecimento) holds value for both individuals and society as a whole as the intermixing of races creates a whiter/mulatto general public (Skidmore 1993, 2010: 82–84, 104; Caldwell 2007: 30–31, 90). Although an ideal, the process of miscegenation encounters social impediments across all sectors of the society, since many parents discourage their offspring from marrying someone “too dark” while at the same time hoping they will marry up the social scale by marrying a lighter person (Goldstein 2003: 122–25; Scheper-Hughes 1992). So the fear of darkening is the flip side of the goal of whitening. This apprehension derives from the assumption that\n\n8 • Brazilian Food darker people have fewer opportunities. This recognition of covert racial prejudice emerges in the widespread ploy that many employers use when hiring people, especially for jobs that will provide the public face of their businesses, such as shop assistants or receptionists, jobs that often do not need many prerequisites to qualify, that the applicant be of “good appearance” (boa aparencia) (Edmonds 2010: 109; Goldstein 2003). This term is widely interpreted as a euphemism for light-skinned (Goldstein 2003; Edmunds 2010). Despite denials about overt racism these sorts of attitudes form the basis of many social interactions and expectations. Despite the persistence of different types of identity in Brazil, there is still a strong, and arguably strengthening, overarching sense of encompassment in a single nation. Politics, media, and sports are important venues in which people across the country share common goals, hopes, and identities. However, a “paradigm of inclusion is the tool of the dominant (white) society” (Sjorslev 2004: 84). So, many of the themes and developments that are seen as Brazilian, from Carnival to the Olympics, from soap operas (Telenovelas) to ecotourism, are developed and controlled by the already powerful elites. Despite recent moves toward fuller democratization, Brazil still functions as a hierarchical society in which power is no longer vested in the authoritarian military regime but in which a class of people traditionally accustomed to holding power maintain hegemony. This class is predominantly white, wealthy, and educated. These exclusive structures are well illustrated in some of Da Matta’s work on civil behavior (1986, 1987; Da Matta and Hess 1995). Da Matta discusses how rules and laws are applied unequally and how the poor and marginal people are the ones subject to discipline according to such strictures. The elite and wealthy expect special privileges due to their “exceptional” character or status (Da Matta 1987). Such people can sidestep the system by appealing to their position or their connections to others with higher and more important positions. These forms of “dodging” the rules and regulations, which in all honesty were made for “others,” are classified under the Portuguese term jeito. To fix the problem or manipulate others to your advantage is to get them to give you a pass (dar um jeito). Da Matta ties this sense of privilege in with the common expression “Você sabe com quem você esta falando?” (“Do you know to whom you are speaking?”) This expression is meant to put the other in his or her place and imply the speaker is of higher status and authority. When used, it implicitly threatens the addressee and suggests he or she may suffer if the higher-status person is not treated with care. This expression can be used up and down the social ladder so people who are put down by those above them will turn around and use this technique on those they believe below them when they judge it to be to their advantage. While Brazil as a nation does not have rigid rules of caste or apartheid, it does have strong values surrounding social divisions, and different races and classes are kept apart in important ways. In cities, the poor most frequently live on the hills, often very steep ones, and the upper classes live on the flats, often near the beach and sea. The wealthy almost never enter the poor areas commonly known as favelas. Poorer\n\nIntroduction • 9 people cross over into wealthier spaces, however, often as workers and domestic employees but even in this capacity they are viewed with wary suspicion. Such service workers are kept apart by separate entrances to buildings and apartments and separate elevators. Overt hostility threatens those who cross the line (Goldstein 2003: 109–10; Gillam n.d.: 99). Even within a house or apartment, rich or poor, lighter or darker, employer and employee are separated into social and service areas. Domestic workers (empregadas literally meaning “employee” but used to designate domestic workers) shop, cook, and do laundry in the service areas of the home, entering the social areas only to clean and serve. Employers traditionally only enter the service areas to instruct the servants.\n\nFeeding and Food Exchange Anthropologists tend to see processes of exchange and gift giving as creating social relations and mediating between different parties. Exchange is often viewed as a reciprocal relationship with gift givers becoming receivers at a future point in time. This connection holds true to some extent in Brazil but fails significantly in other ways. Although an intimate relation, the bond between workers and employers remains one where service is exchanged for money, therefore, the relation remains one of abstract wage labor. Despite the fact that empregadas cook the employers’ food and care for their children, their relationship with their employer falls short of a reciprocal exchange. Domestic workers shop, cook, and prepare food but do not share it in a commensal relationship.1 If empregadas do eat the same food as their employers, they usually eat the leftovers in a separate space. Domestic workers may eat with or feed the children of their employers, but this shared commensality evokes the sense that such employees are more like children than adults, a perception that again separates them from their employers. Donna Goldstein describes the awkwardness of eating with her domestic servant in her book Laughter out of Place. The social distance the relationship required was collapsed in this act, and the employer/employee relationship shifted to one of friendship, a relation that could not be accommodated in the more formal business relation. Friendship won out in this case (Goldstein 2003: 40–41). This complex relationship of intimacy and distance, while far from unique, underscores the complex race and class relations in Brazilian communities. Who eats with whom is also a significant aspect of the social criteria for community. In the microcosm of a home, those who eat together and share sustenance also share deeply penetrating connections encapsulated in the symbol of shared substance. Producing, preparing, and consuming a meal is an act that creates and transforms both the ingredients and those who act and consume them. Those who produce the foods do so as labor, but in contemporary society labor is a multifaceted process. Planting, growing, and harvesting food for the table is no longer an essential part of feeding oneself and one’s family. Instead the work involved in acquiring the ingredients for\n\n10 • Brazilian Food a meal involves shopping in markets or stores. As Marx recognized, a living wage must suffice to fulfill not just the material requirement for a worker’s survival, but the extended requirement for the worker to reproduce himself or herself and the larger unit to which he or she belongs. Food, clothing, housing, and education for the laborer and his or her family should all be subsumed in this set of endeavors. Even for those engaged in wage labor, the procurement of food is necessary labor. In capitalism, the laborer earns a wage that serves to enable him or her to meet these needs and provide for the extended network of family (Marx 1978: 156–57). The connections created by nurturing and providing break down when the provider is not investing in the maintenance of her or his own unit of reproduction but that of an employer. The values of exchange and reciprocity, the creation of connection through commensality and shared substance, become severed from the productive processes of cooking, feeding, and imbuing the food with the value of one’s own labor. In this environment the notions of exchange or reciprocity become unhinged from social intimacy. The act of giving such items as food takes on a different meaning if the person who makes the food cannot eat it himself or herself. The symbolic properties of food, the notions of shared substances, the sociality of commensality, are all suppressed in this social context, but certain aspects of symbol and meaning persist even in these tortured relations. The desire to make these exchanges part of a social network, however, frequently overwhelms the structural distance between care-giver and cared-for enabling deep emotional ties to develop. Authors such as Giberto Freyre helped promulgate the notion of the racial democracy, based in large measure on the existence of such deep ties that develop between white children and the darker women (mãe pretas) who care for them as children (Freyre [1933] 1986; Skidmore 1993: 191). In addition, the ubiquitous meal of rice, beans, and meat, cooked by lower-class women, often descendants of slaves, undergirds the national sense of a people suffused with its colonial and slave past that is refreshed on a daily basis through the food they all eat. If you are what you eat, then to that extent, in the Brazilian context, you are all the same.\n\nFood and Status The relationship of food and status has long been a subject of analysis and reflection. As Goody argued several decades ago, people and cultures express inequities through a number of criteria (1982). This mode of displaying distinction through the selection, preparation, and display of food remains significant in Brazil today. The principal diet of 90 percent of the world’s population for much of human history has been based on a staple starch such as, but not restricted to, rice, wheat, potato, manioc, barley, or taro, often with a small portion of meat or greens as a relish. The wealthy have usually signaled their distinction by eating a more varied diet, often including rare or hard-to-come-by ingredients (Tannahill 1973). Many of our\n\nIntroduction • 11 assumptions about what is valued are based on our evaluation of who eats it. Elites or dominant classes may select foods because they are difficult to acquire. Spices, exotic meats, birds’ nests, pigeons’ tongues, caviar, and so forth are all foods that have met these criteria. Rich foods in our Western parlance are so termed because they were the choice of the rich. Even in cases where the wealthy do not eat a diet substantially more varied than the rest of society, they often display their status by eating more than others and by selecting the best quality ingredients for their meals. In fact, they have the ability to determine what is considered the best quality (Bourdieu 1984; Goody 1982; Spittler 1999; Terrio 1996; Roseberry 1996). They also have the luxury to change such evaluations at will. While a large percentage of Brazilians still rely on a carbohydrate-based diet of rice, beans, and manioc, status and wealth are signaled through the accompaniments to these staples. The national dish, feijoada, is a basic rice and bean dish, but can be raised to a higher level through the addition of multiple meats and sausages. A feijoada completa, as we will see in Chapter 6, becomes a celebratory meal. As social patterns and norms have shifted, so have the criteria for fine dining. Increasing the quantity of protein (meat or fish) is the most frequent way of elevating the status and prestige of a meal. As we will see in later chapters, some restaurants cater to diners’ desires to consume large quantities of varied meats while others entice them with small dishes of exotic ingredients in creative combinations. In these and other cases, the pleasure of consumption is compounded by the pleasure of signaling one’s belonging to a community recognized as sophisticated and powerful because of that consumption. Globalization, media, and new values around cooking and eating have altered consumption around the world. Many of these changes are beneficial: new foodstuffs, vegetables, fruits, starches, new styles of preparation, an appreciation for other cuisines, and new gastronomic techniques applied to familiar foods all broaden the array of choice of what we eat. The double-edged sword of these new choices is that many people have been seduced by diets higher in sugar, fat, salt, and calories, which, along with a lifestyle that is more sedentary, has led to increases in “lifestyle” diseases, many of which are consumption-based. Obesity, high blood pressure, and diabetes have resulted from changing patterns of consumption. Fortunately, currently many fewer Brazilians than in the recent past are suffering from malnutrition caused by insufficient foods, but other health factors have now become a significant issue. Until recently, the lower classes were often unable to sufficiently feed their families to prevent malnourishment and even starvation (Scheper Hughes 1992: 129–45, 153–63, 207; Goldstein 2003). This atrocious state of affairs has improved considerably as a result of a number of different trends. The first was the introduction of conditional transfer payments to eligible families. These payments were made to families with children to encourage the families to keep their children in school rather than send them out to work. If they meet\n\n12 • Brazilian Food attendance requirements, the family receives an automatic payment for each child designed to go toward food, medicine, and clothing. Other programs provide assistance for families with different needs. These programs have drastically reduced the prevalence of hunger and malnutrition in Brazil although they have not sufficiently alleviated poverty. The booming economy in Brazil, however, has created new jobs and opportunities and raised a larger proportion of Brazilians into the “middle class.” In the midst of such changes, a proliferation of “haute cuisine” (fine dining) establishments and the associated phenomena of gourmet stores, magazines, TV programs, and cookbooks has raised the bar on how people can set themselves apart from others through refined tastes and consumption. Stores, restaurants, magazines, TV shows, home construction and renovations are all part of a changing landscape. Restaurant culture has long been a part of Brazilian life, particularly among the middle and upper classes who eat out when they cannot return home for lunch or whenever there is no one to cook for them. Even poorer people may consume food cooked by others since they often do not have functioning kitchens, utensils, and so forth, so they buy prepared food from street vendors or small shops. In the past, fine dining often referred primarily to European-style restaurants in the French and Italian tradition. This presumption has changed considerably as Japanese, Chinese, Thai, Portuguese, and even Brazilian restaurants have attained high gastronomic standards and international renown. In the last several decades, however, restaurants have become global as Brazilians apprentice in Europe and the United States and as Europeans and others move to Brazil and open starred restaurants. Brazilian chefs and restaurants are now part of the international scene and accorded the same honors and status as those that were formerly reserved for a more exclusive community. Within this landscape, foods and cultures have become reevaluated. A particularly good example of this phenomenon is the way that new chefs showcase ingredients from the Amazon, the cerrado and the mata atlántica. These items have become valued culinary treats in regions far from their places of origin. Additionally, the foods introduced or used by slave populations or early explorers and foods brought by relatively recent immigrants have risen in the national value system as people look to their own heritages to distinguish themselves from the Euro-American hegemony. Status and identity take multiple forms in many places, but this truism holds particularly strong in Brazil. Different regions value different forms of music, art, cuisine, dance, recreation and appreciate different body types, house construction, and family relations. The roles played by food, its production, distribution, consumption, and cultural valuation in this complex pattern of social differentiation are the focus of the following chapters, which examine cuisine, identity, value, and social relations in a variety of Brazilian communities. In Brazil, certain foods take on an iconic status as foods that convey meaning, identity, status, race, class, and gender. In the various chapters of this book I examine\n\nIntroduction • 13\n\nVIGNETTE: CAFÉ DA MANHÃ: STARTING THE DAY Many Brazilians begin the day with a simple meal of coffee, hot milk, and a roll. This meal is named and conceptualized around the coffee and is often referred to as “drinking” (tomar) breakfast. Despite this phrasing, many poor people cannot afford coffee and begin the day with either nothing or a roll. Parents often leave for work before feeding their children. Young children are often left a small sum of money to buy a few rolls from the bakery or local food stall to share among themselves before school. A working woman, often a domestic worker, will leave home early in the morning to arrive at work in time to prepare café da manhã for “her family.” She may pick up fresh rolls and perhaps ham and cheese to accompany the rolls. She makes coffee for the family and may also have a cup herself. After cleaning up the breakfast dishes, she usually shops for the employers’ lunch or dinner. In the past, many families ate a large midday meal and those who worked outside the home often came home to eat. Nowadays, this practice is less common since work and home are often long distances apart. If part of the family is home, the domestic will prepare a meal. She may also prepare a dinner/ supper to put in the refrigerator that the family can heat up for dinner. She then starts to clean the house or apartment. The family might choose not to eat at home in the evening. Most cities have a range of restaurant options from very casual barracas (stalls), which serve soups or fried fish, to informal family-style restaurants that serve pizzas, steaks, or stews, to fine dining restaurants with a full menu. Restaurants that serve a variety of meats in an all-you-can-eat setting are a Brazilian specialty that will be more fully described later. Middle-class dining differs from that of the poor in quantity and often in substance too. The poor may share the diet of rice and beans with manioc and pasta but without the fresh greens and meat that the others can afford. The value of comida farta is a constant, however. In some regions of Brazil, breakfast is a more substantial meal, often including porridges made of corn, manioc, wheat, or rice. Often made at home, these dishes are also sold on street corners and markets to passersby. Restaurants and hotels often offer a breakfast buffet that includes coffee, hot milk, fruit, juice, rolls, and specialty rolls like pão de queijo, cheese rolls, ham and cheese, and even eggs and frankfurter-like sausages in tomato sauce. This restaurant-style breakfast is found throughout the country. In certain parts of the country, however, weekend breakfasts may take on a special regional flair. These cafes da manhã regionais are found in many rural and semirural areas. Such restaurants, often with pavilion or open-air seating, may offer regional specialties like açaí and tapioca, tapioca or corn cakes, sun-dried meat and manioc flour, and numerous other regional dishes. Extended families often gather to enjoy these repasts on their way to shopping or other weekend errands.\n\na few of the foods and food traditions that instantiate these properties and the social relations and communities that value them. The Afro-Brazilian dishes of the Northeast, the indigenous ingredients of the Amazon, the hearty stews of the European colonists are all embedded in communities that see themselves as the embodiment of their heritage and terroir. As was true of Da Matta’s daughter, some of these meanings only become evident when they are lost or threatened; others are valued in the repetition of daily life, and this esteem is demonstrated, either in the attention that is given to them or the ubiquitousness of their presence.\n\n14 • Brazilian Food\n\nMigrations and Flows Brazil is not only a country of immigration but also a country of internal migration and external emigration. These multiple flows across space and time have impacted the notions of identity and regionality. As a settler colony, Brazil’s earliest immigrants were Portuguese explorers and land owners. These early arrivals were often seeking their fortunes and were frequently in motion. They moved among the native populations and often relied on them for food, medicine, and shelter. Without in any way going native, the colonists adapted to new foods like manioc, and açaí, tucupí, guaraná, cupuaçu, maracujá, and pirarucu, among many others (Camara Cascudo 1983; Radel 2006; Bosisio 2000; Lessa and Meideiros 1999). Early accounts describe not only the pleasure these immigrants took in the local foods (and women) but also the nostalgia (saudade) they felt when they returned to Portugal or elsewhere for the land, people, and food. The Belem dining table in 1665 was totally indigenous, a permanent feast of roast fish, game and seasonal fruits. Although not yet the fashion, drinking assay [açaí] wine, was a daily and much appreciated habit. Even among the authorities and soldiers few traces remained of Portuguese cuisine, and there were cases of colonial officials returning home who almost died from nostalgia, particularly for the dishes created by the native cuisine. (Souza in Bosisio 2000: 128)\n\nAlthough most people now see the Amazon region as something of a hinterland, and nowadays the majority of the population lives in the southern regions of Brazil, the earliest arrivals entered along the Amazon River, and Belém was the first capital of Brazil. Foods that are only just now reentering broad popular consumption were then well known and prized by diverse ethnic groups. As immigration shifted from explorers to settlers, the population moved south, especially along the coast of the Northeast triangle, which became the dominion of sugar barons. The second capital of Brazil was Salvador de Bahia in the heart of the sugar industry. Brazil was the first major producer of sugar plantations and the first to break the monopoly of the sugar trade from the east. As Brazilian plantations came into production, the price of sugar dropped in Europe and the market expanded exponentially. The effects of sugar production on trade and the industrial revolution in Europe and North America have been excellently examined elsewhere (Mintz 1985; Camara Cascudo 1983; Skidmore 2010; Burns 1993), but in Brazil it determined much of the country’s early history and economy. Early attempts to recruit labor from the indigenous populations led to a drastic decimation of that population. However traumatic that was for those indigenous groups (Tupi and Guarani primarily), it was also economically problematic for the local plantation owners who needed enormous manpower to cultivate sugar. In the absence of local labor, they turned to importing slaves from the west of Africa. Over the course of almost three centuries,\n\nIntroduction • 15 more than three and a half million Africans were captured and survived the transatlantic voyage to Brazil (Burns 1993: 43). This constituted the largest trade in slaves in history. This huge influx of labor dominated the sugar industry and continues to dominate the culture of much of Brazil. Although primarily destined for plantations on the northeast coast of Brazil, some slaves were transported to plantations and farming schemes in the Amazon (Nugent and Harris 2004; Acevedo and Ramos de Castro 2004) and others were subjected to the mining of precious metal and gems in the present-day state of Minas Gerais (Burns 1993). Slaves were put to work in all manner of tasks from back-breaking labor in the fields to boiling the cane juice over huge fires, to excavating deep mines, but they were also employed to make sculptures, compose church music, as well as cook, clean, and mind the children for upper-class households (Burns 1993: 45). Pockets of descendant slave populations reside throughout all these regions. Communities of escaped slaves (and some freemen) formed communities called quilombos or mocambos, which are still dotted across these regions, often in less accessible areas (French 2009). Descendants of this slave population are today estimated at between 30–50 percent of the total population, but actual figures are hard to verify because census data allows people to self-classify across numerous categories. A number of descendant communities are now documenting their history and status under the Quilombo clause in the 1988 Constitution that makes quilombola communities eligible for community land reserves (French 2009: xiv). Many of these communities had forgotten or disavowed their heritage and become generic caboclos, or mixed-race peasants. Since the 1960s and the civil rights movements in the Unites States, black political and cultural consciousness has expanded tremendously in Brazil as well as elsewhere in the Americas, and there has been a resurgence of local groups searching for their roots (French 2009). When slavery was finally abolished in Brazil in 1888, most former slaves continued as workers or sharecroppers on plantation and agricultural land, but the economy of Brazil was shifting, first to other agricultural/pastoral pursuits (cattle raising, cacao, coffee farming, rice cultivation, and later soy and wine grapes), and then to more industrial development. The locus of this new activity was south of the sugar belt and as drought and poverty pushed small farmers off their traditional lands and homes, thousands and hundreds of thousands moved to urban and industrial areas looking for better livelihoods. Migrant communities sprang up in most cities, often in shantytowns on the hillsides and peripheries of those urban centers. These shantytowns, now called favelas, have proliferated and evolved in every city. Residents of these communities service the homes and businesses of wealthy residents, although some entrepreneurs also began to provide goods and services to favela residents. This pattern of rural to urban migration persists today. The new agricultural ventures also drew migrants from war-torn and povertyprone areas in Italy, Germany, Japan, Lebanon, and Eastern Europe, among other\n\n16 • Brazilian Food places. Many of these immigrants settled in ethnic enclaves that still preserve an Old World character a century or more later. Religion, language, dress, music, architecture, and particularly food, mark the distinctive heritage of these groups. Each group has added its own important dishes and ingredients to the national diet, ranging from kibe to sushi to stroganoff. Contemporary migrations from Ukraine, China, Spain, and Portugal increase Brazil’s diversity of food and culture. A few years ago there was an extremely popular telenovela called América on Globo TV, the most widely watched channel in Brazil.2 The underlying theme of the series was to “follow your dream,” and for many young Brazilians this meant leaving home for better opportunities elsewhere (in a few cases it meant striving to make their dream come true at home). It narrated the story of several individuals in the midst of migrating to big urban areas from the hinterlands and others migrating from urban Brazil to North America. The heroine of the story crosses into the United States from Mexico and lives as an illegal alien in Miami. The glorification of the search for a better destiny became a popular ideal, encapsulated under the title América. Several journalists and analysts believed it enticed more people to try to migrate to the United States. Although the journey across the border from Mexico was depicted in gruesome detail, the success of the heroine’s venture gave hope to many who currently dream of a migration northward. The movement of peoples from the periphery to the center(s), and the fantasy of the movement northward, demonstrates the mobility of Brazilians both past and present. As Brazilians migrate to the United States, the availability in that country of Brazilian foods like farinha, pão de queijo, churrasco, guaraná, and many others increases as groceries and restaurants cater to both an expatriate community and a cohort of foodies into exploring this cuisine. Another important flow of emigration and migration occurs between Brazil and Portugal. This migration has ebbed and flowed and shifted and reversed numerous times over the past five centuries. The waves of migrants from Portugal to Brazil and from Brazil to Portugal have coincided with the economic destinies of these two countries. Brazilians have privileged access to Portugal, which they have taken advantage of during the prosperous years of the European Union, and Portuguese have flooded the labor markets of Brazil during the latter’s times of prosperity. The two nations continue to creatively incorporate elements from the other’s culture. The Portuguese traditions in both food and culture remain an important substrata to Brazilian culture. In particular, Portuguese food traditions ranging from salted cod dishes to seafood stews to cakes and custards heavy with milk, sugar, and butter have influenced many Brazilian food habits. These dishes have been adapted to the ingredients available in Brazil but are recognizably related to those found in Portugal. Portuguese merchants and slave traders traveled around the world conveying people, ingredients, and recipes from one continent to another. All of these flows have influenced Brazilian food and cuisine.\n\nIntroduction • 17\n\nFood and Flows People travel and food travels and in the process both change and adapt. Food often takes on different meanings and relevance for the community that enjoys it. Sometimes the meaning becomes reified and holds on to a fossilized set of associations and conceptions. Fried polenta in the regions inhabited by central Italian immigrants to Brazil exemplifies this ossification. This dish is ubiquitous in the southern states of Brazil and is served as an appetizer in many homes, restaurants, and community festivals. Polenta was the staple for many immigrants in their home regions of Italy, where it was associated with their hard-scrabble life of scarcity and poverty. Serving it now in immigrant-descended communities commemorates this heritage and a communal sense of shared hardship. Today’s elders, however, claim the younger generation has lost appreciation for these meanings of polenta and either view it as boring or as some sort of ethnic stigma attached to the group. Nonetheless, serving the polenta is a continuing tradition. In contrast, mocotó, a stew (guisado) made of cow’s hooves and manioc pieces, is a cartilaginous and sometimes boney concoction that was a staple in both the Northeast and far South of Brazil, both cattle-raising areas, which retains a symbolic value for a range of consumers. This stew instantiates the poverty of the regions and the meager portions of a butchered cow that were affordable to the poorest residents in these regions. Nowadays it is a comfort food to displaced migrants and is served in restaurants in São Paulo and Porto Alegre as a special dish on certain days of the week. In such ways, foods and their meanings can create a sense of well-being, of place, home, body, and memory for communities of an immigrant diaspora. This sense is constantly renewed and reinforced but its origin may not be consciously recognized. Consciousness surfaces as gaps or absences, changes in availability, cost, and other impediments come into the picture. Sometimes foods take on an iconic status as representing a tradition or a place, but sometimes the sense and value of a food or a dish changes as people move, or as the dish or food becomes available in regions or venues apart from the accustomed areas.\n\nTravel for Food Culinary tourism has become mainstream. Restaurants, cooking schools, and markets are now standard components if not highlights of the traveler’s itinerary. Glossy cookbooks and magazines proliferate in many languages and supplement the standard dining guides. How do we explain this abundant interest in gastronomy? Is culinary tourism a product of affluence, a reflection of a new hedonism, or recognition of the vital role that food plays in all aspects of our social and cultural life? In this mix, several Brazilian foods, and even whole cuisines (such as the foods of Bahia or Minas Gerais), have circulated in an increasingly global society. Brazilian\n\n18 • Brazilian Food restaurants have opened around the world, so tourists arrive with expectations about the foods they will sample. Enjoyment of these delights becomes a principal way that Brazilians and others overcome the distances between outsiders and themselves. Feeding others and sharing foods are almost universal ways to show solidarity and create good will. Receiving food with respect and enjoyment fosters this relationship and creates a pathway to sharing both substance and meaning. But food plays an important role in drawing distinctions as well. Food is an important marker of identity, and thus is used to emphasize difference as well as similarity. This book is an examination of the relationship between food, kinship, race, and place in diverse regions in Brazil. I have made no attempt to be inclusive but to pick foods and regions that illustrate the way food exemplifies, creates, and enhances relationships and encounters in daily life. Each chapter focuses on a few dishes and ingredients that form a nexus of meaning rooted in a particular region and examines why certain dishes and ingredients have special salience for food and identity, and speak to issues of race, class, and gender. I examine the contrasts between the ways the foods are appreciated in their home territories with the ways they have come to be used and valued outside the region. In this wider context, many of them have become elements of the emergence of a new food culture in Brazil that is vibrant and creative, and as such, form essential parts of the ongoing transformation of this dynamic nation and its rapidly changing culture.\n\n–2– Is Bahian Moqueca Just Fish Stew? Food and Identity in Salvador, Bahia\n\nWhen I first went to Brazil in 1982 as a young wife and mother, we lived for four months in Rio de Janeiro. I became accustomed to the beaches and boulevards, cafes and markets of that beautiful city. After accustoming myself to that Brazil, I was amazed to arrive in Salvador, Bahia, and find a very different atmosphere and culture. In place of the iconic tile sidewalks and tall apartment buildings, Salvador offered cobblestone streets and plazas and colonial architecture. Music, from samba to capoeira and from Angolan drumming to Yoruba drumming, reverberated through many of the public spaces and drifted through windows, doors, and around street corners. Wafting over all these sensory stimuli was the smell of dendê oil and other unfamiliar food scents, mostly prominently emanating from corner stands where Bahian women cooked acarajé in pots of the iconic red palm oil boiling over a charcoal fire.1 Although I had eaten a Bahian moqueca before arriving, I was unprepared for the array of dishes that constituted the regional cuisine nor had I anticipated the pervasive salience Bahian cooking held for the residents of Salvador and the surrounding countryside. Immediately enthralled by this new gustatory experience, I sought to both experience as many dishes as possible and to learn as much as I could about their preparation. My hostess generously shared a few key recipes with me, but being an academically minded person, I sought the written texts as well. My husband and I searched bookstores and restaurants for Bahian cookbooks, but they seemed thin on the ground. We finally found two small collections in Portuguese (Papeta 1979; Junqueira 1977). What made this enterprise even more interesting, and perhaps disconcerting, was the incredulity of my middle-class friends as to why I would want to acquire these books. Why would I want to cook Bahian food? Two things come into perspective in thinking about this cultural dissonance: the first is their wonderment about why I would want to prepare Bahian food; and the second was why I would want to do it myself. In the middle-class Brazilian culture of Rio and São Paulo, if one wanted to eat Bahian food outside of Bahia, one would hire a Baiana (Bahian woman) to come to one’s home to cook, or one would go to a Bahian restaurant, of which I learned of only one in Rio. Twenty-five years later a new friend gave me\n\n– 19 –\n\n20 • Brazilian Food a third alternative: one could fly to Bahia. In these conversations I came to realize two things: cooking Bahian food is a manifestation of one’s identity as a Bahian, or putting it another way, one has to be Bahian to make this food. The second was an iteration of something I had already experienced but not fully understood, namely that middle-class Brazilians almost never cook for themselves. Leaving the second insight aside for a moment, I want to examine the first.\n\nBahian Identity Bahia is a large state in the northeastern part of Brazil. It has a long coastline with numerous bays (bahias) and islands along the shore. The interior of Bahia is contiguous with the sertão or dry, semiarid region of the Northeast. Bahia was an important sugar-growing area from the 1550s onward and for many years was the richest state (until the discovery of gold in the late seventeenth century). Salvador da Bahia, the principal city in the state, became the capital of Brazil until 1763. The old city and harbor were built during this colonial time and remain classic examples of the colonial architecture. The old section of Salvador was named a UNESCO heritage site in 1985. The center of this district is called the Pelorinho after the old pillar that was used to whip and punish unruly citizens and particularly slaves. As the center of the sugar industry, Bahia also became one of the centers of the slave trade. Slave auctions were held in the Largo do Pelorinho, the site of the pillory post. The aftermath of the slave trade remains prominent in the vibrant Afro-Brazilian culture for which Bahia is renowned. This legacy highlights music (samba, axe samba, reggae samba, capoeira, Angolan drumming, Yoruba drumming), food, and religion. Activities that had been stigmatized in the context of poverty and racism for their connections to the slave past in the Northeast have, in recent decades, become touted as rich components of a cultural heritage that gives the region a unique identity (Van de Port 2005). In conjunction with this revaluation, the old colonial center of Salvador de Bahia, which had become rundown and impoverished, has been at least superficially refurbished to highlight its charming colonial architecture, plazas, and dramatic views over the harbor. This city and especially the central Pelorinho became a destination for tourists both internal and foreign who were drawn by the syncretic blend of music, religion, and local history. One of these magnetic elements is Bahian food, which constitutes a small but distinctive cuisine based on the intersection of foods from Europe, the Americas, and Africa. Although Bahian food has been well known for its distinctive characteristics for a long time, in the last several decades it has emerged as one of the pillars of Bahian identity. Locals repeat the mantra that Bahia is a mixture of indigenous, European, and African cultures, and while this aphorism is true of much of Brazil, it is most strikingly manifest in Bahia, especially in Salvador, and in its distinctive cuisine. Although the food is a well-integrated mixture of indigenous, African, and global ingredients, styles, and\n\nFood and Identity in Salvador, Bahia • 21\n\nFigure 2.1 Baiana in full white attire selling acarajés on the beach in Salvador da Bahia. Photograph by Jane Fajans.\n\ntechniques, it is best known for its African qualities in large part because it is closely associated with the worship of a pantheon of African deities. These African flavors and the food they create continue to carry their original slave era and diasporic context in the present. As Bahian identity has increased in prominence, several aspects have taken on iconic status as markers of the region and its culture. Bahian ethnicity and identity became recognizable around the country in the form of a Bahian woman dressed in lacy white clothes of eighteenth-century design. This image is found on tourist posters, magazine and airline advertisements, and in regional guides. Although one can find women clad in this attire in tourist venues in old Salvador, they are also commonly found on street corners or on the beaches throughout the region, cooking and selling acarajé dumplings and traditional sweets made from boiled coconut, cocoa, and sugar. These Baianas set up their stalls nightly on street corners, on weekend days on the beach, or periodically in the many plazas of the cities during festivals such as the Festas Juninas or Carnaval.2 Most Baianas de acarajé are attired in turbans, lacey blouses with puffy sleeves, and full skirts with multiple layers. These outfits are mostly white, but can also be in the vibrant colors of West African fabrics. The dress is reminiscent of African market women and the house slaves of the colonial era master’s house. The symbol of the Bahian woman is multivocal. She represents roots, nurture, continuity, and a kind of purity in her appearance and occupation. Part of her\n\n22 • Brazilian Food\n\nFigure 2.2 Acarajé with filling of vatapá, shrimp, and peppers. Photograph by Jane Fajans.\n\nsymbolic appeal is the purposeful links her attire, her skin color, and her ingredients make to West Africa and the people and food there. This combination highlights her roots with Africa and the food eaten there. Her ability to feed and nurture others with scant resources is associated with female values of the wife and mother. What makes her visual appeal most arresting, however, is her ability to maintain an unblemished frilly white outfit on an urban street corner while deep frying dumplings in hot and sputtering red oil. She is thus a symbol of an idealized wife and mother spanning past and present. Acarajés, which are Bahian dumplings, are made of black-eyed peas soaked and pounded or blended into a paste. This is then made into a ball and deep fried. The dumpling is served hot, split in half, and filled with vatapá (a kind of bread pudding made with soaked stale bread, nuts, and dendê oil) and topped with dried shrimp and a hot pepper sauce. The acarajé is eaten in one’s hands, with the vatapá and other condiments spilling and dripping over the sides, making this a fitting food for outdoor eating. This dumpling and the red palm oil in which it is fried are both derived from West African Yoruba cuisine. Beyond its African-ness (Hamilton 2001), this dumpling incorporates the abundant seafood caught off Bahia’s miles of coastline, the European flavors of bread and wheat, and native crops like cashews and pimentos. This dish thus incorporates ingredients from the various flows that have converged upon Bahia. Although messy to eat, this whole dish is portable and can be eaten as you walk or loll in your beach chair. It encapsulates Bahia.\n\nFood and Identity in Salvador, Bahia • 23 As I mentioned above, the quintessential symbol of Bahia is a Baiana woman selling acarajé and doces (coconut sweets) on a street corner. These foods are only a few of a number of street foods sold on the plazas and beaches of Brazil. Street food is very popular in Brazil and people, often whole families, promenade in the evenings to snack. On the weekends, they may spend hours on the beach. During these outings, they can sample a variety of foods such as shrimp, cashews, grilled cheese, popsicles, coconuts, popcorn, soft drinks, beer, and acarajé. Many of these snacks are sold by perambulating vendors who snake through the crowds selling their wares, but small beachside stalls also set out tables and beach chairs that families appropriate for hours, intermittently ordering beer or a snack while also buying from the itinerant vendors and acarajé sellers who set up near these beach-front establishments. The informality of beach culture, including the lack of clothing, which makes Brazil (in)famous in the Euro-American imagination, contrasts greatly with the old-fashioned formality of the Baiana cook. She sits among these scantily clad people in her full skirt, turban, and lace top, like an anchor to the past, a representative of what has transformed in today’s society of leisure and relative plenty. She is a symbol of what is particularly Bahian in the midst of the more generic Brazilian pastimes of the beach and carnival.\n\nSão Joaquim Market While the Baiana is the public face of Bahia, behind the scenes there is a less elegant and less pristine side to Salvadorian cuisine. São Joaquim Market in Salvador is a vibrant and fascinating place. São Joaquim is neither a street market nor a designated municipal plaza filled with market stalls. Rather, the market is a warren of streets and alleys in which some stands open into small store-like spaces and others are just stalls set up in the middle or sides of the alley. São Joaquim is a permanent market that has grown and folded into itself over the many decades of its existence. Although there are sections of the market that specialize in certain foods, meats, beans, flours, fish, live chickens and ducks, and cooking pots, this order is not totally consistent and different types of foods coexist haphazardly with Candomblé (AfroBrazilian religion prevalent particularly in the Northeast) artifacts, tropical birds, soaps, and utensils. On the fringes of the densest part of the market are small corrals where goats and chickens are kept until needed. Although some of these animals are there to be butchered and sold in the stalls, many are bought live and taken to the Candomblé terreiros for ritual sacrifices. This bustling and frenetic place is the heart of food culture in Salvador, but until recently was off the beaten track for tourists and outsiders. In an attempt to change this, and coincidently underscore the African heritage of the community, in 2006, the Prefecture sponsored a photo exhibit in the market itself. The photographs constituting the exhibit, Lá e Cá (“Here and There”), were hung on lighted boxes throughout\n\n24 • Brazilian Food\n\nFigure 2.3 A stall selling beans, rice, dried shrimp, and dendê oil in the São Joaquim Market in Salvador. Photograph by Jane Fajans.\n\nthe market, suspended over the aisles, tucked in the corner of an open stall, on the wall of a building, and any other nook that could possibly take a photo. Given the visual confusion of the market with its laden counters, stacked shelves, and various meats, lanterns, hooks, ropes, baskets, pots, and other goods hanging from overhead beams, this was not an ideal venue for a photo display. It was hard to know if one had actually perused the entire exhibit since the pictures were essentially camouflaged and there were so many other visual stimuli in the market. This exhibit certainly made more people aware of the market (it was advertised in newspapers, brochures, and on the sides of buses) but I did not notice much difference in the clients actually strolling around the market. The photos were taken in and around Angola, Africa, and Salvador, Brazil, both Lá e Cá, “Here and There,” as the exhibit title connotes. The implicit theme of the exhibit stressed the similarities between the two historically connected regions. The photos portrayed children playing, women cooking, portraits of old and young, female and male, streets with people and animals, and market stalls with bottles of dendê oil and piles of ceramic pots. None of the pictures had labels or designations on them indicating in which country they were taken.3 No one I spoke to claimed they could tell which picture had been taken in which place, and I certainly did not have any grounds for distinguishing them. It seemed a matter of pride to many of the Brazilians I spoke with that they could not tell the origin of one photo or another. This exhibit had the effect of making visual what had been strongly believed and valued already: Bahia retains much of its African heritage. On one level,\n\nFood and Identity in Salvador, Bahia • 25 however, the exhibit objectified the people and settings it portrayed by decontextualizing them; but on another level, it powerfully conveyed the feeling of a shared identity that transcended different contexts (and different continents). Near the São Joaquim Market is a municipal fish market. This market is markedly and immediately different from the bustling and undisciplined activity of the Feira de São Joaquim. Here, in a new and tiled building with a ceiling two stories high, fish vendors sell their wares in neat cubicles. The fish are kept in refrigerators or on trays of ice, and counters and scales are clean and clear. Many of the stalls have prepackaged containers of cut-up seafoods ready to be used for moqueca or bobó, two of the signature Bahian dishes. These plastic bags have layers of shelled mussels, shrimp, crab, and fish ready to be marinated in lime and simmered in a wok-shaped moqueca pot for a moqueca or bobó meal. Shoppers do not need to choose or weigh their selections; they just pick a bag of the appropriate size. To make the dish even easier to prepare, a small stall containing crates of tomatoes, peppers, limes, coconuts, and cilantro, the principal ingredients for moqueca, stands near the market entrance. This stall provided the only nonmarine products available in this market. Assuming a household has dendê, rice, and coconut milk at home, a busy cook could drop by here and in one stop pick up the wherewithal for the evening or weekend meal. In contrast to the Feira de São Joaquim, this market was practically empty when I visited it.\n\nHome Cooking Food in Bahia is a family affair. Discussions around food focus on who made it, what was served, and who was there to eat it. Family meals, especially family gatherings, are important and frequent, and many extended families gather for a weekly meal. Friends like to describe the different meals that their families enjoyed on weekends. One man described how he cooked on Saturday mornings and made bobó de camarões (a shrimp and manioc dish), which he presented to his extended family at mid-day. Another described how his family gathered every Sunday for cozido (a meat and vegetable stew). Most families gather on Saturday, but this latter informant’s family accommodated the schedule of one son who took courses on Saturday so they postponed their weekly meal until Sunday. Holding family gatherings on Sunday, instead of Saturday, is not an uncommon practice in response to scheduling conflicts. The family get-together, as well as the food consumed, creates a comfort zone of familiarity and satisfaction. Along with the popular cozido (meat and vegetable stew), bobó de camarões (mashed manioc with shrimp and dendê oil), and moqueca, one finds family celebrants eating other dishes like frango com molho pardo (chicken with a dark sauce of chicken’s blood) and abobora com camarões (pumpkin stuffed with shrimp). Of the dishes mentioned above, bobó de camarões is the most popular meal at these sorts of gatherings. Bobó de camarões is a polenta-like mush, although made of manioc instead of corn, with shrimp, vegetables, and dendê oil. It is a filling ( farta) comfort food.\n\n26 • Brazilian Food\n\nBobó de Camarão Ingredients 2 lbs. of fresh shrimp 2 lbs. of manioc (can be bought frozen in many stores) 1 onion 4 sprigs of cilantro 2 cloves of garlic 1 tomato Salt to taste ½ cup of dendê oil (available outside of Brazil online, or in specialty stores) 1½ cups of coconut milk\n\nPreparation 1. 2. 3. 4.\n\nCook the manioc until soft like a potato. Make a moqueca with the shrimp and tomatoes (see recipe on following pages). Beat the manioc with the coconut milk. Stir in the moqueca.\n\nOutsiders associate Bahian food with the Baiana, and see it as produced by a femalegendered body. In particular, cooking for the orixás is done by the women adepts of the terreiros (see next section). Inside Bahia most household cooks are women and cooking is still a feminine activity; however, many men are proud of their cooking skills and enjoy cooking for their families. Since Bahian food is such an important part of Bahian identity, the ability to prepare this food and offer it to others is one many Bahians, including men, seek to share. Cooking and eating are equally valued activities and can be done by both genders, although women are usually the public face of the cuisine. As in other parts of the world where food is so embedded in the meaning and rhythm of everyday life, Bahian food is seen as enmeshed in the fabric of family and religion. It combines and recombines a number of ingredients, including dried shrimp, seafood of all kinds, tomatoes, onions, peppers, cilantro, manioc, cashews, coconut milk, and dendê oil. There are countless variations on the dishes. Modes of preparation are passed down between generations and among friends. Each family prides itself on its own variation, which they consider the best.\n\nMore Than Just a Good Meal: Candomblé and Feeding the Orixás Bahian food exists to feed an other worldly realm in addition to the local and foreign inhabitants of this earthly one. Behind the public presence of the Baiana is the world\n\nFood and Identity in Salvador, Bahia • 27 of Candomblé, the Afro-Brazilian religion practiced widely across the nation but closely associated with the African slaves brought to the Northeast sugar-producing regions. Baianas also feed the deities of the Candomblé pantheon. Female members of the terreiros (religious houses) continue to dress in outfits inspired by African and eighteenth-century colonial styles. As adepts in these religious houses, they honor the deities, orixás, by preparing ritual foods for each one on special occasions. Each orixá is associated with a particular food, a fruit, a drink, a color, a day of the week or month, and an environmental niche. Many people in Bahia wear white on Fridays, to show their respect for Oxalá, the god of creation who has become associated with that color and that day. Acarajés are ritually important as the food of a Candomblé deity named Yansá (Iansá). Adepts feed her this food once a month on Wednesday, which is her day.4 Xangô is fed caruru, an okra dish, and Oxum is given ximxim de galinha, a chicken stew, as well as moqueca. Moqueca is also offered to Yemanjá, the goddess of the sea (Ribeiro 1962; Radel 2006). Some of these foods have also come to be associated with Catholic saints through their association with particular African deities. Syncretistic cults like Candomblé are products of the mixture of African and Catholic religions, and the long history of repression of African cultures in the New World. Each god in Candomblé is associated with a saint in the Catholic Church, although the actual saint associated with an orixá may vary from region to region or terreiro to terreiro (Ribeiro 1962). Feast days intended to celebrate particular African gods, the orixás, were simultaneously associated with certain Catholic saints such as São Cosme or São Damião, Santa Barbara, the Virgin Mary, and many others who came to stand in for a different orixá and provide occasions for worship that were acceptable to the dominant society. In such cases, Bahians may prepare an honorific and festive meal dedicated to a Catholic saint too. One such ritual meal is caruru. Ordinary caruru is a vegetable dish made with okra, and is called caruru só (only caruru). If you invite someone to a caruru festa, however, the guests expect a ritual meal of ximxim de galinha, vatapá, acarajé, caruru, farofa, efó, milho branco, yams, beans, and pipoca.5 This meal is prepared for the deity Xangô and on saints’ days like those of São Cosme and São Damião6 or for a festival like the second of February, the day of the sea goddess, Yemanjá, or for less formal celebrations like a birthday or family reunion (Ribeiro 1962). Individuals occasionally plead with a saint or orixá to grant a request for health, love, prosperity, or other personal desires, vowing to provide such a feast if the wish comes to be. The fulfillment of such a vow provides food and faith for a community of adherents. An important aspect of the Candomblé religion is animal sacrifice. Goats and chickens are the most commonly sacrificed animals. This ritual practice was made very apparent on one of my visits to the public market of Salvador, São Joaquim, where I came close to being run over by a wheelbarrow trundling a goat out of the market, bound for sacrificial rendezvous with the deity.\n\n28 • Brazilian Food\n\nTwo Moquecas If there is one signature ingredient in Bahian cooking that embodies the culture, heritage, and identity of the place and people, it is azeite de dendê, dendê oil. This oil is pressed from the pulp, not the kernel, of the red palm tree ( Elaeis guinensis), which is native to West Africa and is orange-red in color. Although high in antioxidants, it is also high in saturated fat, which has made it less popular with cholesterol-conscious consumers. Although still an essential ingredient in Bahian food, it is no longer used in as great quantities as it once was. Except in the case of acarajé, dendê oil is not usually used as a basic cooking oil, but as a flavoring, usually added shortly before finishing a dish. It gives a tangy flavor and a slightly viscous texture to any dish to which it is added. In Bahia, most locals do not know that other regions produce moquecas, vatapás, and carurus too. They think of these dishes as local specialties unique to the Bahian (or at least Northeast) region, and as a product of the ethnic confluence of Portuguese, African, and Brazilian indigenous influences. Bahians were surprised to hear that I had eaten moquecas in Espirito Santo (a state just to the south of Bahia) and vatapás in Pará. In particular, they were aghast to learn that Espirito Santo claimed superiority in the art of making moqueca. Outside of Bahia, however, the moquecas of Espirito Santo are well known and touted by the cognoscenti. I was first told of them by acquaintances from Rio and planned a visit to Espirito Santo on their recommendation. In Espirito Santo the competition between the two regions is best expressed by the saying “Moqueca é so Capixaba7 o resto é peixada” (“The only moqueca is Capixaba, the rest is only fish stew”), a saying flaunted on posters throughout the capital of Espirito Santo, Vitória. This culinary competition pits the old Afro-Brazilian state of Bahia (and by extension other Northeast states) against the more European-influenced state of Espirito Santo. The travel literature on Espirito Santo emphasizes the Swiss-like farms and woodland scenery of the interior where wine and cheese production are important industries. While both moquecas are delicious, the Espirito Santo moqueca is actually the dish more akin to ordinary Brazilian fish stew ( peixada) in its ingredients and the way they are prepared. The Bahian moqueca is a distinctly different sort of dish. Bahian moqueca is made from seafood, shrimp, crab, mussels, fish, and/or a combination of the above. These ingredients are marinated in a ceviche-like lime, hot pepper, and cilantro mixture and cooked in coconut milk and dendê, which as noted above, was originally brought from Africa. The result is a creamy distinct flavor with a bit of a bite. The moqueca is served with rice and a polenta-like porridge ( pirão) made with manioc flour and dendê. Bahian food, which is based on dendê oil, is very distinctive. The ingredients that go into Bahian food are self-consciously understood by the Bahians as representing their cultural/ ethnic mix of European, African, and indigenous cultures (the manioc flour is recognized as indigenous).\n\nFood and Identity in Salvador, Bahia • 29\n\nFigure 2.4 Moqueca Baiana with pirão, rice, and farinha in a typical presentation. Photograph by Jane Fajans.\n\nSeafood Moqueca (Moqueca Mariscara) from Bahia For 6–8 people Ingredients 1 lb. of fresh shrimp or prawns 1 lb. of meaty fish fillet (scrod, sea bass, monk fish, etc.) 1 lb. of squid (optional) 2 lbs. of mussels or crab legs (to garnish the top) 1 bunch of cilantro 2–3 tomatoes 1 green pepper 1 sweet white or red onion 1–3 chili peppers (by taste) 2–4 limes ½ cup of good olive oil 1–2 cups of coconut milk (or one 14-oz. can) Salt ½ cup of dendê oil\n\nPreparation 1. Smash or chop ½ of the cilantro with salt. Mix with the juice of the limes, and diced chili pepper.\n\n30 • Brazilian Food 2. Marinate the fish and squid in the lime, cilantro, and pepper mixture for at least ½ hour. 3. Slice the onion, pepper, and tomatoes in rings. 4. Arrange layers of vegetables in a pot. Bahians use a red clay pot shaped like a wok, so a wok is a reasonable substitute. 5. Add olive oil and turn the heat on medium-low. 6. When vegetables begin to cook and oil is hot, add fish, squid, and coconut milk. 7. When the fish is almost done, add shrimp and mussels or crabs to the top of the dish and drizzle dendê oil over the top. 8. Cook until shrimp are pink and oil is “cooked.” 9. Garnish with cilantro. 10. Serve with plain rice and pirão if desired.\n\nThe Capixaba moqueca, in contrast, does not include coconut milk or red palm oil, and instead uses urucú (annatto or colorão) and tomato to give a red color to the stew. The fish and vegetables (tomato, onion, cilantro, and garlic) are cooked together in a fish stock (Santos Neves and Pacheco 2002: 104, 107). The result closely resembles the fish stews of Mediterranean Europe. Capixabas (people from Espirito Santo) say that their moqueca is purer and that a good fish stew does not need the extra flavors of coconut milk and dendê.\n\nMoqueca Capixaba Ingredients 2 lbs. of fish (badejo) in cutlets 1 lb. of diced tomatoes 1 lb. of diced onions 1 bunch of cilantro 2–3 spring onions 2 cloves of chopped garlic ½ cup of olive oil ¼ cup of annatto 2 limes Salt to taste 1 cup of fish stock\n\nPreparation 1. 2. 3. 4.\n\nHeat the olive oil in an earthenware pan and brown the onion lightly. Add half the diced tomato and onion. Season the fish cutlets with salt and lemon and place in the pan. Cover the fish with the rest of the tomato and onion.\n\nFood and Identity in Salvador, Bahia • 31 5. 6. 7. 8.\n\nAdd the coriander, salt, annatto, and stock. Allow to cook for about 10–15 minutes without stirring. Check to see if the fish is cooked and with sufficient salt. Add a few drops of lemon juice. (Santos Neves and Pacheco 2002: 35)\n\nFor Capixabas the extra flavorings (tempero) of Bahian moqueca are excessive (Ezekial 2006), and they claim their moqueca is simple and pure. But what is this simplicity and purity? It is essentially the absence of African ingredients, not the absence of flavorings per se. Without saying it, but with an implicit meaning, the Capixaba moqueca advertises itself as a white, purely European, dish, more like the seafood dishes of Portugal or France. There is, thus, a racist undertone to the culinary competition. In effect, the Capixaba are saying, “We have no African heritage and thus we make a purer moqueca.”8 The Bahians, by contrast, say their moqueca is a unique dish that stands apart from virtually all other fish dishes because of the signature combination of ingredients. The competition between Espirito Santo and Bahia over moqueca versus fish stew is also a way of marking the differences between the two states and their people. Espirito Santo is whiter, richer, and more European in outlook. This signals inclusive and exclusive categories of race and class, of difference, purity and exoticism. Because moqueca has become such an important part of Bahian identity, Bahians presume it is a Bahian dish. The Capixabas are trying to\n\nFigure 2.5 Moqueca Capixaba, often served with pirão as well. Photograph by Jane Fajans.\n\n32 • Brazilian Food undermine this presumption and prove themselves superior in the culinary domain. They actively promote their cuisine as a tourist attraction and as a symbol of their distinctive identity. But how is it that Espirito Santo focuses on this competition while Bahia does not even seem to be aware of it? Herein lies the power of identity politics. Although poor and until recently economically underdeveloped, Bahia has preserved a strong regional identity and presence in the national and international arenas. Bahian music, religion, and food are markers of place and community. In the past, and frequently in Brazil today, people have a hard time conceiving of Bahian food outside of Bahia, and even if it is prepared outside of Bahia, they imagine it must be prepared by a Baiana (Bahian woman). For Bahians the foods constituting their essence are not just recipes: they are the residue of a history and a unique regional and cultural identity of which they are proud. Eating certain foods can make you Bahian, and food is Bahian because of where and by whom it is cooked. You are what you eat, but you also make/cook what you are. For this reason, Bahian food is intrinsically associated with those whose essence it embodies. Espirito Santo does not seem to have such a definite identity, and it is not generally seen as an interesting tourist destination, either inside or outside of Brazil. Food and foodways do not immediately differentiate a Capixaba from anyone else in Brazil except Bahians. Instead the immigrants who settled there and their descendants who now live there are of European extraction. Espirito Santo has a much smaller Afro-Brazilian population than Bahia. Interestingly, according to my personal, nonrandom, and unscientific sample of (non-Bahian) Brazilians I encountered and worked with, when middle- or upperclass Brazilians from other regions attempt to make moqueca or order it at restaurant, they tend to prefer the Capixaba to the Bahian variety. Many claim that the dendê oil is too heavy or unhealthy. They seem to feel more comfortable with the “purer,” less African, more familiar version. These preferences are hard to express in overt cultural terms. They cannot talk about people in terms of difference or purity so this sense of social and cultural difference is imputed to a taste difference. The race and class differences are masked by displacing them onto an external object, a fish stew, which takes on symbolic importance beyond its substance. Food is identity and identity is food. For this reason, moqueca can never be just fish stew.\n\nEmbodied to Disembodied, Inalienable to Alienable: Bahian Food Becomes Global Brazilians see Bahian food as inextricable from the body of a Bahian who both produces it and is produced by it. Bahians are open to sharing both their food and culture. They are particularly pleased to teach others to prepare their signature dishes,\n\nFood and Identity in Salvador, Bahia • 33 and although they are not as prevalent as in some parts of the world, there is an increasing number of cooking classes and cookbooks, in Salvador, the capital of Bahia. The language schools of Bahia typically offer a trinity of extracurricular classes that includes cooking, capoeira,9 and samba. I took the cooking and samba classes. Although distinctive in flavor, Bahian dishes are relatively simple to make. As I mentioned above, when I first went to Bahia in 1982, I became enamored with the food and wanted to prepare it myself. My search for a regional cookbook finally netted two small collections of recipes (Papeta 1979; Radel 2005). These collections were just slightly fancier than mimeographed collections such as those put out by clubs or associations in the United States, and they have fallen into pieces with the years of use I have given them. On more recent trips over the past few years, I have noticed a florescence of glossy cookbooks with fabulous color photos and expanded discussions of the role of food in the regional cuisines of Brazil (Dos Santos 2005; Radel 2005, 2006). These new books are very much oriented toward a tourist market, and they have full translations in English and more extended discussions of the ingredients employed. Cookbooks symbolize several processes of identity building (Appadurai 1988). They signify a collection of dishes that can be labeled as belonging to a group: regional, national, religious, community, ethnicity, and so forth. They also betoken a change in the attitude people have toward their cuisine. A cuisine that can be represented in a book is alienable. It is no longer something that comes into being through activity alone, it exists as an abstraction beyond any particular manifestation of it. Recipes are no longer things that reside in people’s heads and hands. They can be detached and exchanged with others, taught in the aforementioned cooking classes, and laid out in print and photos. Such a cuisine is no longer embodied in particular subjects or understood as an extension of that subject’s relations with the world. I believe Bahian food was, and still is thought of, to some extent, as inalienable. Cooking it is still assumed to be an embodied practice that one can only do if it is a part of one’s socialization. This is why Brazilians from outside Bahia and the Northeast assume that if you want Bahian food, you must hire a Baiana/o to make it. The commodification of this cuisine through cookbooks and restaurants is aimed at an audience primarily beyond Brazil who see the food as less embedded and embodied in a regional identity, and as alienable from their religious, social, and regional connections. For these reasons, the lovely and expensive books have English and Spanish translations.\n\nThe Indigenous Side of Bahian Food Although the popular conception of Bahian food focuses on its African ingredients, many of its ingredients are indigenous to the Americas. Of the nonmarine ingredients in moqueca, tomatoes, pepper, and the manioc meal mush (pirão) are all native\n\n34 • Brazilian Food American foods (Foster and Cordell 1992). In Bahia, and especially in Salvador, the most common description I heard was that Bahia was a region in which Portuguese, African, and indigenous cultures came together. This confluence is recognized in several domains. Socially, the confluence emerges in the variety of mixed-race people throughout the state. This mixture is further evidenced during syncretic rituals such as those that constitute Candomblé. When participants of this ritual go into trance, I was told during such an occasion, they can be possessed by one of two types of spirits: an African spirit or a caboclo spirit. The caboclo is a person of mixed-race (Brazilian or Afro-Brazilian and Indian). The different types of spirits have different personalities; the caboclos are more serious while the Africans are “happier” and imbibe a great deal of alcohol while in trance. The same person can be possessed by both spirits (at different moments) and onlookers observe their behavior to judge which spirit has taken possession. The interweaving of the various ethnicities is also present in the language, where words like orixá, Candomblé, and acarajé are part of the daily language in the Northeast and are not commonly spoken in the rest of Brazil. A parallel case, considered in a later chapter, is the influx of Amazonian Indian words in the daily language of the northern region, of which Bahia is only one part.\n\nFestas Juninas Although distinctive in many ways that I have been attempting to describe, Bahia shares many traits with other Northeastern states and to some extent with the rest of Brazil. The rural, inland region of Bahia with its rituals and foods is essentially continuous with this distinctive regional culture. The shared continuities are evident in another important Brazilian festival. This celebration lasts for almost a month and is called the Festas Juninas (June Festivals). This s"
