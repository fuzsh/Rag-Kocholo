It was generally associated with Brazilians of East-Asian descent but was not a very widely diffused identity, with few people self-identifying as amarelo. bandeirantes backwoodsmen, explorers The main explorers of the Brazilian frontier and later the subject of myths and folklore as well as a symbol of national identity. This traditional image of the bandeirante is that of a swashbuckling male with superhuman courage who combats the forces of nature and dangers threatening the natives, although throughout history, a wide range of people joined in the bandeiras (expeditions), including plantation owners, traders, mulattos, and the military. Many bandeirantes were involved in capturing and enslaving indigenous people. bandeiras flags The name for the expeditions undertaken by the bandeirantes into the interior of the continent. bóias-frias cold lunch A name for farm workers who do not have land of their own to work on.
