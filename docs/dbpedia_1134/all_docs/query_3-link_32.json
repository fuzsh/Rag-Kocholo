To date, however, no comprehensive distributional record nor impact assessment exist for the spread of the genus, precluding informed management strategies. To provide these tools, our study aims to (1) provide an annotated checklist of species for this taxonomically confusing genus, (2) survey all available literature on the spread of the genus and summarize and map its invasive distribution, and (3) assess the overall socioeconomic and environmental impact of the genus on a global scale using the Generic Impact Scoring System (GISS). First, we provide an updated annotated species list. We then summarize seventy-one unique invasion records along with twenty-one instances of demonstrated impacts. Species of the genus Pterygoplichthys have now invaded five continents and twenty-one countries, and show an extended range in their native South America. Impact analysis yielded a GISS score of 18 to 19, indicating low to moderate levels of socioeconomic and environmental threats. However, to bolster the confidence in this analysis in future iterations, more research should aim to move beyond just “first records” and instead empirically evaluate species’ effects on native ecosystems.\n\nKeywords: Generic Impact Scoring System, Armored sailfin catfish, Distribution, Aquarium trade, Fisheries\n\nBACKGROUND\n\nThe genus Pterygoplichthys (Siluriformes: Loricariidae) includes several popular aquarium species that have become invasive in tropical, subtropical, and warm-watered regions around the world (e.g. Hoover et al. 2004). Commonly called armored sailfin catfish, janitor fish, peces diablos (devil fish), or “plecos,” species of the genus exhibit most of the characteristics that predispose certain fishes to successful invasion (Marchetti et al. 2004; Ruesink 2005; García-Berthou 2007). This suite of biological traits include: (1) high fecundity (Hoover et al. 2004; Gibbs et al. 2008), (2) broad physiological tolerance (i.e. salinity (Capps et al. 2011; Brion et al. 2013), pH (Harter et al. 2014), pollution (Liang et al. 2005), and hypoxia (i.e. enlarged, hypervascularized stomachs allow for air-breathing and survival for up to 30 hours out of water (Armbruster 1998; Gibbs and Groff 2014)), (3) rapid growth of 10 cm/year (Liang et al. 2005; Gibbs et al. 2013), (4) an armored exterior with powerful pectoral spines (Ebenstein et al. 2015), (5) life span of more than 5 years (Gibbs et al. 2013), and (6) high aquarium-vectored propagule pressure. Human-mediated factors also foster the spread of Pterygoplichthys spp., namely the popularity of members of the genus in aquariums and subsequently aquaculture, contributing to high propagule pressure (e.g. Hoover et al. 2014). Once established, these fishes are extremely difficult to remove (Hill and Sowards 2015).\n\nAlso common to the genus is a complicated taxonomic history, including numerous generic and specific synonymies (e.g. Armbruster 2004). Such taxonomic confusion can make sifting through literature for past invasion records difficult and lead to uninformed management decisions. Further complicating management strategies is the diffuse nature of invasion records for Pterygoplichthys spp. There is no database that tracks the genus’ spread comprehensively. Online distribution databases such as the Global Biodiversity Information Facility (GBIF) and the Global Invasive Species Database (GISD) are incomplete, providing fragmented records and excluding non-established invasion records that can be valuable for predicting and thwarting future invasions (Kulhanek et al. 2011; GISD 2017, respectively). Further complicating potential management efforts is the lack of any quantitative or comprehensive framework for threats to colonized areas that these fishes may impose. A quantitative, flexible, and generic framework for analyzing impacts can be useful for prioritizing control and eradication efforts (Nentwig et al. 2010; van der Veer and Nentwig 2014).\n\nIn an effort to fill these knowledge gaps and provide tools to aid in future management efforts, our study has three objectives: to (1) provide an annotated checklist of species for this taxonomically confusing genus, (2) survey all available literature on the spread of the genus and summarize and map its invasive distribution, and (3) assess the overall socioeconomic and environmental impact of the genus on a global scale using the Generic Impact Scoring System (GISS). We then discuss some common themes and knowledge gaps in the literature. Finally, we conclude by making suggestions for future studies of this highly invasive genus.\n\nMATERIALS AND METHODS\n\nLiterature Survey\n\nWe conducted an exhaustive literature search using Web of ScienceTM (Reuters 2017), Google Scholar (2017), and online government databases (e.g. USGS Nonindigenous Aquatic Species Database (2017)). Literature was surveyed through October 1, 2017. We considered peer-reviewed scientific publications, technical reports, theses and dissertations, and governmental records. To ensure accurate reporting of records, we only included studies with deposited voucher material and/or high-resolution photographs of specimens, along with identification remarks for the specimens, excluding any records not conforming to these criteria, such as personal communications. Such practices are recommended to avoid erroneous records of introduced taxa (Bello et al. 2014). In cases of redundant records such as those reporting on the same species in the same locality, we included the more comprehensive record and excluded the other(s). Keywords we used to find relevant literature were ‘Pterygoplichthys’, ‘Liposarcus’, ‘Glyptoperichthys’, ‘armored catfish’, ‘invasive’, ‘record’, and combinations thereof. We read each work, extracted relevant data, and catalogued the data into a summary table of all unique records. We also used the literature survey to compile an annotated list of species.\n\nDistribution Mapping\n\nAll exotic occurrences of the genus were mapped. We generated the map using Esri’s ArcGIS version 10.4 software based on all records available in Appendix 1. To show finer-scale distributions, we split some countries into second- level geopolitical subdivisions. We represented the global distribution of Pterygoplichthys spp. with solid geopolitical polygons for established populations, solid circles for potentially isolated detections, and an open circle with a red X for eradications. We designated each species using a unique color. Geopolitical areas with multiple species established are displayed with a multicolor pattern using the relevant species’ colors. The Gulf Coast/Caribbean region and central Indo-Pacific region were represented in higher resolution map insets with red and yellow borders, respectively.\n\nQuantifying Impacts\n\nTo assess the degree to which introduced Pterygoplichthys spp. impart socioeconomic and environmental impacts, we used the Generic Impact Scoring System (GISS). The GISS was developed by Nentwig et al. (2010) and refined by Nentwig et al. (2016) and Rumlerová et al. (2016). This scoring system is robust to gaps in data, not taxon-specific, and can be customized per case of interest (Lavoie 2017; Nentwig et al. 2016). The system uses a six-level scale ranging from 0 (no detectable impact) to 5 (the highest possible impact) (Table 1).\n\nNormally these criteria are applied to six environmental and six socioeconomic categories to assess overall impact. Categories may be excluded (or otherwise receive a score of 0) for taxa for which the categories do not apply (Lavoie 2017). For our study, terrestrial-specific categories (n = 2) were excluded to include only those categories for which Pterygoplichthys spp. potentially have an impact. Given the lack of evidence of interspecific differences in impacts (Table 2) and the difficulty in species-level identification of members of Pterygoplichthys, we pooled species in order to increase the power of the data set and assess the overall impact of this genus of ecologically and physiologically similar species following the treatment of the genus by the Global Invasive Species Database (GISD 2017). All categories followed Nentwig et al. (2016). The environmental categories we used were effects on (1) plants or vegetation, (2) animals, (3) native species through competition, (4) native species through the transmission of diseases or parasites, (5) native species through hybridization, and (6) ecosystems. The four socioeconomic categories we used were effects on (1) animal production, (2) human infrastructure and administration, (3) human health, and (4) human social life. We used in our analysis all demonstrable impacts relevant to any of the abovementioned categories encountered in the literature review. We followed the GISS scoring rubric as closely as possible per the instructions provided by Nentwig et al. (2016) in assigning scores to achieve a summed impact score.\n\nTable 1.

We included seventy-one unique records. Seven introduced species or hybrids of the genus Pterygoplichthys have been reported from five continents, plus an extended range in their native South America, and twenty-one countries (Fig. 1).\n\nOf these, fifteen records involve detections (i.e. species present but whose establishment status is unknown) and fifty-five instances are established (i.e. reproducing) populations. A single successful eradication of a previously established population of P. disjunctivus is reported from the Rainbow River, Florida, USA (Hill and Sowards 2015). The most abundant established populations are those of P. disjunctivus and P. pardalis (n = 22 each), followed by P. multiradiatus (n = 5), P. ambrosetti (n = 4), and likely hybrids of P. disjunctivus x pardalis (n = 2) (Table 3).\n\nThe first established population was reported from Florida, USA in the late 1950s (Fuller et al. 1999). Since 1985, the number of both detected and established reports in the literature has rapidly risen (Fig. 2). The summarized data will be deposited online through GBIF.\n\nGeneric Impact Scoring System (GISS)\n\nOur literature survey produced twenty-one papers providing evidence on the impacts of Pterygoplichthys spp. in their nonnative ranges. In table 4, we provide detailed justifications for scores along with references used to calculate the GISS. The six environmental categories yielded a score of 11-12 (of a possible 30), while the four socioeconomic categories evaluated yielded a score of 7 (of a possible 20), resulting in a cumulative GISS of 18-19 (of a possible 50) for the genus.\n\nTable 3.

These consistent invasions by a select few species likely reflect the ubiquity of those species in the aquarium trade (ABO personal observation). The rise in popularity of these species in aquaria coupled with increased sampling effort is likely responsible for the steep uptick in detections and the disparity between detections versus establishments observed since 2005 (Fig. 2). While reproductive success following aquarium dumping is not a guarantee, increased propagule pressure results in more frequent detections, a higher rate of failed establishment, and a higher rate of successful establishment (Lockwood et al. 2005). However, to our knowledge, no comprehensive, geographically widespread survey of genus composition in the aquarium trade has been performed and species availability likely fluctuates temporally and geographically.\n\nSuch a survey, when complemented with molecular analysis, may also help to elucidate the nature of the morphologically intermediate forms that have been noted in many places around the world, particularly between P. disjunctivus and P. pardalis. One hypothesis posits that these intermediate forms represent hybrids (Capps et al. 2011; Wu et al. 2011; Nico et al. 2012). Nico et al. (2012) suggests these cases may be best described as “hybrid swarms”.\n\nAlternatively, it has been suggested that P. disjunctivus and P. pardalis are synonymous, actually representing extremes of variation in pigmentation (Wu et al. 2011; Jumawan et al. 2011). This is not unreasonable considering that, unlike other species of Pterygoplichthys that exhibit allopatric native distributions, P. pardalis and P. disjunctivus occur in sympatry in their native range. They are also the most commonly reported “species” to be hybridizing in invaded waters. P. disjunctivus is noted as occurring in the Upper Madeira River Basin as well as the main channel of the upper Amazon River, while P. pardalis occurs in the lower and middle stretches of the Amazon River (Weber 1991 1992). Overlap occurs over a wide section of the middle Amazon River Basin (Weber 1991 1992; J.W. Armbruster, personal communication). Original descriptions of these species diagnosed them by lateral and abdominal pigmentation alone - primarily the density of ventral mottling (Weber 1991 1992; Armbruster and Page 2006).\n\nThese perplexing forms may provide a unique opportunity to study the prevalence and consequences of hybridization among multiple invasive species or, at the very least, suggest the need to revisit the alpha-taxonomy of the genus.\n\nThreats and Eradication\n\nPterygoplichthys spp. impose threats to their invaded ranges. The most well-documented of these impacts were the displacement of native fishes (Bunkley-Williams et al. 1994; Chavez et al. 2006a; Hubilla et al. 2008; Cohen 2008; Krishnakumar et al. 2009; Mendoza-Alfaro et al. 2009; Chaichana et al. 2011; Wei et al. 2017), bioturbation and increased turbidity (Hoover et al. 2004; Hubilla et al. 2008; Nico et al. 2009), and damage to fisheries gear and subsequently fishermen livelihood (Chavez et al. 2006a; Wakida- Kusunoki et al. 2007; Krishnakumar et al. 2009).\n\nThis impact evaluation is comparable to the one done by Hoover et al. (2014), which also analysed the genus’ environmental effects. Hoover et al. (2014) based their analysis on expert opinion in which researchers studying the genus ranked its environmental impacts as Low, Medium, or High. The analysis was restricted to the United States. Three experts ranked the impacts as Low, three as Medium, and seven as High. These results suggest a moderate to high level of environmental impact in the United States, which is higher than the 18- 19 GISS score that the present study recovered. Unlike the study by Hoover et al. (2014), we evaluated both socioeconomic and environmental impacts and did so on a global scale using many more data. Future studies may shed further light on the true nature of the threats that species of Pterygoplichthys pose.\n\nBased on the current GISS score, impacts of the genus are present but somewhat low. Still, depending on locality and local densities, these fishes may merit eradication efforts by managers. One previous successful eradication occurred via hand- and spear-removal in a Florida, USA river (Hill and Sowards 2015). However, such physical removal is intractable for large or widespread populations. Fortification of bank walls to prevent burrowing males from allowing egg deposition is another avenue. While possible, this strategy can be expensive and has been utilized very little; for example, in some south Florida, USA communities (GISD 2017; K. Gestring, personal communication). Other options for removal include incentivizing the development of food fisheries for these high-biomass species and/or the collections of their eggs from male-guarded burrows to sell in the aquarium trade. Both of these options lend socioeconomic benefits while removing wild Pterygoplichthys. For example, successful commercial and recreational fisheries of invasive red lionfish (Pterois volitans) (Linnaeus 1758) are underway in the United States and have been shown to help inhibit local lionfish population growth (Barbour et al. 2011). Unlike the predatory lionfish, however, a food fishery for members of the genus should be cautioned in certain localities where polluted waters have led to potentially dangerous bioaccumulation of heavy metals and coliform bacteria of resident Pterygoplichthys detritivores (Chavez et al. 2006b). Rotenone may also be used as a piscicide but its application should be limited and follow appropriate guidelines (e.g. Britton et al. 2011).\n\nEradication is not typically feasible (Hill and Sowards 2015). Removal of these fishes is difficult and potentially time consuming and expensive per the reasons discussed earlier (see Introduction). Where resources are limited, managers may wish to focus efforts on containing the current established populations and preventing future introductions (Hill et al. 2017; Lawson et al. 2015). The best means of accomplishing this is by educating the public on the importance of not releasing unwanted aquarium fishes into local waterways. Educational campaigns have been found to be successful, inexpensive options in minimizing the release of unwanted fishes (Maceda-Veiga et al. 2016).\n\nCONCLUSIONS\n\nOur study highlights the paucity of data in many areas relevant to informing management schemes. The present GISS assessment should be evaluated with caution in light of the empirically robust data. For example, the means by which invasive Pterygoplichthys spp. displace native fishes is largely unknown but may be food competition (Hubilla et al. 2008) or space (Mendoza-Alfaro et al. 2009). Also unknown are the effects of the siltation produced by burrowing males on aquatic flora. In fact, the vast majority of studies surveyed focus on fauna and socioeconomic impacts. Finally, most studies are local and almost none are regional or national. In general, the scope of research remains modest and more data are needed. Future research should focus on empirically evaluating impacts rather than reporting simple “first records” or anecdotal evidence. Once additional data are available, they should be subjected to the GISS and compared to this analysis to maintain the best available evidence-based resources for managers. Our paper also provides the first comprehensive list of records and impacts and aims to inform managers as best as currently possible, while also highlighting research areas in need of more attention. We conclude by offering the following recommendations for collecting future data. Researchers should (1) collect voucher specimens and tissue sample for identification purposes and genetic studies, (2) publish explicit collection and identification remarks in methodology to better compare across studies and demonstrate study limitations, (3) employ empirical evaluations of local impacts through observational and/or manipulative experiments to establish causal rather than anecdotal relationships, (4) use the GISS to roughly quantify and track impacts as new data are available, and (5) deposit collection material, including high-resolution photographs and voucher accession codes, to online databases such as GBIF.\n\nSupplementary materials\n\nAppendix 1.\n\nAll detected, established, or extirpated records of Pterygoplichthys spp. through June, 2017.
