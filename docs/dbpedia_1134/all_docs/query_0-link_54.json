        "text": "Abstract\n\nThis research, part of a broader exploration of the sources of current Brazilian critical criminology, aims to map the canonical works in the field, especially the publications and research of the 1970s, in order to identify theoretical guidelines, methodological perspectives, and to which extent there is an alignment with the debate of the Global North. This exploration seeks to identify (a) the theoretical perspectives, (b) the empirical emphasis, (c) how gender and race issues were faced, and (d) whether the boundaries between criminology and criminal law were delimited in the general framework of criminal sciences. The conclusion presents a synthesis of the foundational methodological guidelines and the present state of critical criminology in Brazil.\n\nIntroduction1\n\nIn the historiography of Brazilian critical criminology, it is possible to identify numerous movements and perspectives that have their origins in the late 1960s. But, in this varied trajectory, the importance of the corpus of two authors is indisputable: Roberto Lyra Filho and Juarez Cirino dos Santos. According to Vera Malaguti Batista (2012: 117), Latin American critical criminology served as a utopian dam against the violence of the military cycles, and Roberto Lyra Filho and Juarez Cirino dos Santos produced ‘the truest and deepest reading of Marxism on the criminal issue in Brazil’.\n\nIn the 1970s, virtually throughout Latin America, ‘the left wing in penal law studies was in the trenches against state arbitrariness and truculence’ (Batista, 2012: 125). In this context of authoritarianism and institutional violence, in addition to the militancy for civil rights and democracy, critical criminologists developed work that deserves to be revisited, especially for its innovativeness. An important contribution was made along two lines: (a) a political one in defence of liberties, with a focus on criminal justice, as well as social movements and political parties opposing the dictatorship; and (b) an academic one, in the production of knowledge capable of verifying the extent of institutional violence and, at the same time, of denouncing arbitrariness, through what Andrade (2020: 24) calls ‘cognitive resistance’.\n\nThis perception, promoted in the first phase of critical criminology and developed during the dictatorship period, allowed, in the following decades, the national critical thinking to transcend negative views (criminology of denouncing) and the proposal of new public policies (criminology of praxis) aimed towards the efficacy of rights (for example, policies to address mass incarceration, reduce police violence, revise the programme of war against drugs, increase access to justice, revaluate victims, and so on) (de Carvalho and Achutti, 2021; de Carvalho and Matos, 2021a). In the current century, Brazilian critical criminology expands its domains, developing further research in specific areas like cultural and green criminology and the intersection of race, class, and gender through black, feminist, and queer criminology (de Carvalho, 2022).\n\nIn this way, the objectives of this article are first, to map the canonical works in the field, especially the publications and research of the 1970s, and second, to identify their theoretical and methodological perspectives so that current debates – inevitably a return to former ones – do not need to return to square one. With such an exploration, the study intends, in the context of the current discussion about critical criminology in both the Global South and Global North, to outline the first phase of Brazilian critical criminology in order to identify (a) its foundational theoretical perspectives, and (b) the resulting empirical investigations. Second, it seeks to point out (c) how gender and race were addressed, and (d) how the boundaries between criminology and criminal law were delimited in the general framework of criminal sciences. The conclusion outlines the main methodological guidelines and a justification of the present critical criminology in Brazil. As in most western countries, both in the Global North and the Global South, Brazilian critical criminology, despite constituting a practical and theoretical movement consistent with political and academic representation, has always been marginalised, since the official academic and administrative criminology still operates on a positivist orientation.\n\nTheoretical perspectives in the first phase of Brazilian critical criminology: from Lyra Filho (essayistic) to Cirino dos Santos (systematising)\n\nFrom the point of view of theoretical construction, the works of Lyra Filho and Cirino dos Santos founded critical criminology in Brazil. Dialectical Criminology (Lyra Filho, 1972) and Radical Criminology (Cirino dos Santos, 1981) represent a paradigm shift for the Brazilian criminal sciences.\n\nThe first phase of Brazilian critical criminology (1970s) corresponds to the transition from an essayistic perspective to a systematising (scientific) one. Such a classification is appropriate because Cirino dos Santos systematically organised his criminological thinking and Lyra Filho did not. Although both have competently applied critical theory to criminal sciences, Cirino dos Santos’s first publications are clearly systematic: (a) in Criminology of Repression (1979), he presents a scientific project in which he delimits method and object from the critical analysis of positivist theories (biological and sociological positivism); (b) in Radical Criminology (1981), the critique of positivism is replaced by the immersion of criminology in critical theory, especially its effects on the concepts of crime, repressive politics, and alternatives to social control (positive political-criminal guideline); and (c) in The Roots of Crime (1984), he delimits the object of criminological critique at the structural and institutional levels, tackling the concrete violence produced by the economic system and its materialisation in the selectivity proper of punitive institutions globally, in Latin America and in Brazil. In addition, Cirino dos Santos and Sergio Tancredo were responsible for the translation of Critical Criminology (Taylor et al, 1980).\n\nLyra Filho’s style is different. He produced dense, highly complex reflective content in articles, manifestos, manuscripts, handouts, conference presentations, seminars, and classes. Dialectical Criminology (Lyra Filho, 1972), published a year before The New Criminology: For a Social Theory of Deviance (Taylor et al, 1973), is a consolidation of his ideas presented in courses and published in articles from the late 1960s. For this reason, the term essays better represents this collection.\n\nThe point is that this freedom of style should not be confused with a lack of method, especially since the dialectic is maintained throughout Lyra Filho’s academic trajectory. Alexandre A. Costa and Inocêncio M. Coelho (2017) remind us that the non-systematic character of Lyra Filho’s work in no way compromises its conceptual structure, coherence, and objective of elaborating an emancipatory theory of law by confronting the orthodoxies of positivist legalism and sociological scientificism. It is for this reason, after Lyra Filho’s visit to Italy in 1977, that Ferracuti (1978) expressed the hope that Lyra Filho’s work would be published in English, ‘so that it can receive, outside Brazil, the recognition it deserves’ (Ferracuti, 1978: 284).\n\nThe works of Lyra Filho and Cirino dos Santos are thus a point of no return for Brazilian criminology. Given Dialectical Criminology and Radical Criminology, any attempt to reduce crime to explanations of individuals’ action and statistical procedures (classificatory dimension) without addressing structural and institutional violence (dimension of power), including the unequal social distribution of crime (criminalisation and selective immunity), will sound, at the very least, like scientific naivety.\n\nEmpirical perspectives in the first phase of Brazilian critical criminology\n\nResearch in critical criminology in Brazil since its emergence in the 1970s has never been restricted to theoretical reflection. This assertion and its substantiation are important because historically, even in Europe and the United States, considerable criticism of critical criminology is centred on its apparent lack of interest in empirical data. Recalling Larrauri’s response to Aebi’s accusations is apropos: ‘pointing out the lack of interest in the empirical as proper to critical criminology is mistaken’ (Larrauri, 2006: 265).\n\nOne of the main concerns of critical theory (and criminology), in its opposition to traditional theory (and criminology) (Horkheimer, 1983), is related to the fact that, in the technological era, scientific research is governed by a bureaucratic, utilitarian rationality that limits knowledge to descriptive and classificatory activity (data accumulation) (Horkheimer, 1983). Thus, a weak way of doing science held sway, a way that ‘is characterized by the implicit presumption of positivists that the general empirical procedures used by science naturally correspond to reason and truth’. In effect, ‘theory is reduced to a simple instrument, and theoretical means of transcending reality become metaphysical nonsense’ (Horkheimer, 2002: 84).\n\nAs has been discussed elsewhere (de Carvalho and Matos, 2021a), critical theories reveal that the empirical is not to be confused with the concrete, that the phenomenon is not confused with the object, and that the concept is not a mere classificatory resource, but a mediation that allows ‘going against the object and not considering its passive assent… to make processes that occur intimately within society manifest’ (Cohn, 2008: 21). In this sense, ‘[research] instruments and techniques are means used by the researcher to “take hold of the matter”, but should not be identified with the method: similar instruments and techniques can serve (and do serve), on a varied scale, different methodological conceptions’ (Netto, 2011: 26). The opposition of critics, therefore, is not in relation to research techniques or the empirical object but ‘to the valorization of empirical datum as such, of the mere fact observed in the name of its objectivity of [a] given thing’ (Cohn, 2008: 22). In Cohn’s example, class (or gender or race) is not a concept that serves exclusively to designate an object or a qualifying resource relating to the identification of who belongs to which class in a given society, because the concept cannot be unbound from the object. Working with the concept of social classes ‘is not the same as classifying social phenomena; it means noting the real processes that, in a given society, force those who want to know it to speak in terms of class’ because the concepts ‘point deeper to what is in the object but is not evident in the phenomena’ (Cohn, 2008: 22). But critical theory and criminology are not content with the negative, as can be seen below.\n\nThe overvaluation of the instrument and the ‘empirical as such’ are expressions of a scientific posture that leads to methodological fundamentalism. In this sense, Ferrell et al (2008) caricature this positioning in Datasaurus, a beast with a tiny theoretical brain, a huge methodological body, a pretentious and confused statistical instinct, and a small and insubstantial tail that wags thoughtlessly from database to database.\n\nIn his first essay, Lyra Filho importantly denounces the ‘creeping empiricism’ of positivist criminology and functionalist currents of liberal sociology. The ‘creeping empiricist’, in addition to being content to collect as much data and as many facts as possible, often confuses broader theoretical efforts with ideology. Lyra Filho (1972) also denounces the ‘crude dogmatism’ that seduced some Marxist interpretations of society (in general) and the criminal issue (in particular). Crude dogmatism is the result of a ‘lazy Marxism’ that determines reality from a book or an author, transforming interpretation into a harmless mythology, unconnected to ever-changing reality (Lyra Filho, 1972: 41).\n\nUnderstanding critical criminology as critical theory applied to the field of criminal sciences, it departs from the empirical, the research stage where the traditional scientist remains, to question the contradictions of social relations with the purpose of ‘overcoming the resistance of the object… at the very point where the quick positivist hare stagnates and rests, the indefatigable dialectical turtle finds courage to continue in its critical course, expanding the limits of the field to the furthest extent’ (Cohn, 2008: 27). Empirical investigation is therefore essential for critique, in order to avoid mystifications of reality based on unfounded speculations; and the theoretical effort is decisive in giving social and historical meaning to empirical findings, removing them from the risk of political irrelevance.\n\nIt is for this reason that critical work begins with overcoming the dialectic of false oppositions such as theory/method, reflection/performance, must-be/being, normativity/experience, among others. Critical criminology, through a methodological approach that articulates concepts and categories, interprets the criminal issue in the concreteness of social relations.\n\nThe point ‘is not that there is too much theoretical and too little empirical work, nor too much empirical and too little theoretical work. Actually, there is not enough of either theoretical or empirical work. In both dimensions and not only in one or the other, it is necessary to think beyond [what has been done], think further, not to be worn down’ (Cohn, 2008: 27). More theory and experience are therefore necessary to ‘think beyond’. Baratta (1981), one of the first critics to bridge the gulf between the criminology of the Global South and that of the Global North, and with a strong influence on Brazilian criminal sciences, also noted this tension and pointed out ways to overcome these false dilemmas (Baratta, 1981: 27). In the same vein, Lyra Filho (1969) and Melossi (1983) noted the presence of research that overcomes the equally false opposition between micro and macro criminology as one of the historical challenges of criminology.\n\nIn this scenario, it is essential to remember that, parallel to the construction of theoretical bases and discussions about the conditions of the possibility of an autonomous critical criminology at the periphery of capitalism in 1970s Brazil, much fieldwork was conducted to test the hypotheses of the new criminology. This is because, since the emergence of Brazilian critical theory, Brazilian scholars have considered understanding how the punitive system functions, especially the criminal justice and prison systems, imperative for empirical studies. It should be emphasised, therefore, that the first theoretical essays written in Brazil had their basis in empirical research, among which are those of Augusto Thompson, Tereza Miralles, Julita Lengruber, Nilo Batista, Yolanda Catão, Elizabeth Sussekind, Wanda Cappeler, Sergio Tancredo, Cristina Rauter and Cirino dos Santos himself.\n\nThe Penitentiary Issue (Thompson, 1991), an account of Augusto Thompson’s experience as Superintendent of the Penal System of Guanabara; Attitudes and Perceptions of Incarcerated Woman in Rio de Janeiro (Miralles, 1973) by Tereza Miralles; and Cemetery of the Living (Lengruber, 1983), an investigation begun in 1976 by Julita Lengruber, constitute fundamental historical documents pertaining to critical praxis in Brazil. These are theoretical and methodological canonical works that are aligned with critical studies of prisons developed in the Global North in the same period, for example, Foucault’s Discipline and Punish, published in France in 1975, two years after he presented at a conference at the Pontifical University of Rio de Janeiro that inspired Truth and Judicial Forms (1973), and The Prison and the Factory by Melossi and Pavarini, edited in Italy in 1977. Research shows not only that Brazilian critical criminology was up to date with the Global North’s state of the art, but mainly that it was concerned with its ‘adaptation’ to the Brazilian reality, not being content with the mere validation of foreign theories. Remember, also, that Brazilian criminology had already exposed the dysfunction of prison punishment through the anti-prison manifesto Penance of a Penitentiary (1957) by Roberto Lyra, the father of Lyra Filho (for more on the legacy of Roberto Lyra in Brazilian critical criminology, see de Carvalho and Matos, 2021b).\n\nElisabeth Sussekind (2014) recounts how, in the early 1970s, this immersion in the prisons of Rio de Janeiro was possible through the work of research groups coordinated by João Mestieri and Tereza Miralles and Heleno Claudio Fragoso. These research works consolidated the initial perception of the nationwide reality in prisons and established methodologies that were used in numerous subsequent empirical studies. Field studies in prisons (Batista, 1979), asylums (Rauter, 1982), and juvenile reclusion units (Thompson, 1979) were all analyses of the functioning of the criminal justice system, with special emphasis on the selectivity of procedures, resolution of criminal cases, and quality of judicial provision (Miralles et al, 1974; Batista and Catão, 1978; Sussekind and Batista, 1976). Innovative work on the structural links between social inequality and crime was also carried out (Santos and Tancredo, 1977; Cappeller, 1982).\n\nIronically, the assertion that empirical research is absent in Brazilian critical criminology lacks empirical demonstration.\n\nGender and race perspectives in the first phase of Brazilian critical criminology\n\nIn compiling the data of the empirical research conducted by the 1970s critical criminology school, the significant participation of women analysing the gendered disparities of treatment in prison became evident. The studies by Miralles and Lengruber, and later those by Catão and Sussekind, conducted in women’s prisons in Rio de Janeiro, evinced already at that time an interdisciplinary orientation based on a productive dialogue between critical theory and feminist thought.\n\nLengruber’s (1983) Cemetery of the Living: Sociological Analysis of a Women’s Prison stands out precisely because of the link between incisive fieldwork, carried out between 1976 and 1978, and a highly sophisticated theoretical-critical reflection. In the introduction, based on Carol Smart’s work, Lengruber (1983) critiques causal perspectives and discusses how material and structural changes in Western society, linked to the struggle for gender equality and the demand for female work after the sexual revolution, increased the number of women in the criminal system. Lengruber’s research was intense and involved: she explored the prison, conducted interviews, and undertook document analysis. She also observed prison life, aiming to understand why women entered prison, their daily life, adaptation, and organisation; labour; and relations with other prisoners and with the prison administration, including affective ones. This research journey included a rich dialogue with Foucault. However, Lengruber does not merely confirm the Foucauldian thesis that the real function of prison, unlike the official discourse of prevention (rehabilitation and the prevention of recidivism), is to distinguish, distribute and reproduce crime, in addition to expanding the control network in prisons. Lengruber refines the denunciation of selectivity related to social class and points to issues of race and gender as factors that ‘aggravate’ criminalisation:\n\nIn this context, it can be definitively said that in the case of female prisoners of Tavalera Bruce, we have the non-citizen par excellence: they are criminals, women mostly of colour and from the lower strata of society. They are part of the mass of individuals who experience daily injustices and arbitrariness in prison that, in fact, was already part of their life prior to incarceration, but that now takes on distinct and dramatic contours. Arbitrariness and injustice is present in their lives in a tragic and inexorable way, from the violence of the police system that illegally arrests, tortures, and kills, to the violence of the legal system, which by giving differentiated treatment clearly shows that the benefit of the law cannot always be enjoyed by those who possess nothing. (Lengruber, 1983: 135)\n\nIn addition, Lengruber anticipated a conclusion widely explored by contemporary feminist criminologists concerning the impact of patriarchy on women’s judgments (sentencing). Lengruber stresses that women’s deviation represents a violation of a double order: violation of the legal norm, materialised in the criminal process, and violation of the moral norm, established by gender social roles.\n\nLengruber’s pioneering work draws attention to how structural and institutional violence related to the incarceration of women constitutes a problem not yet addressed in the Brazilian prison system. Thus, in addition to marking a theoretical moment in Brazilian critical criminology by introducing intersectionality – that in itself evidences the value of the Lengruber’s work – the methodology of her research is continually being applied (for example, Chies, 2005; Oliveira, 2020).\n\nA different style and methodology were used by Zahidé Machado Neto in Criminal Law and Social Structure: Sociological Commentary on the Criminal Code of 1830 (Z. Machado Neto, 1977), another canonical work in Brazilian critical theory. In her extensive documentary research, Zahidé Machado Neto reveals the close relationship between the legislative process of criminal codification and the social organisation of the post-independence period. Mayora Alves (2018) highlights the three axes of Zahidé Machado Neto’s study: (a) class, education, and the theoretical influences of the authors of the Criminal Code; (b) its ‘ideology’; and (c) the effort to connect liberalism, patriarchy and slavery. In the historiography of Brazilian critical criminology, Zahidé Machado Neto’s research inaugurated a series of important studies on the theoretical and ideological bases of Brazilian penal codes. Following Z. Machado Neto’s (1977) study of the 1830 code, the following doctoral theses have been completed: Gizlene Neder, inspired by Rusche and Kirchheimer, on the Code of 1890 (Legal Discourse and Bourgeois Order in Brazil (Neder, 1987)); Camila Cardoso de Mello Prando, on the Code of 1940 (The Knowledge of Jurists and Criminal Control (Prando, 2013)); Marcelo Mayora Alves, on the Penal Code of 1969 (The Penalists in the Civilian-Military Dictatorship (Alves, 2016); and the definitive revision of Brazilian criminal law recently carried out by Nilo Batista (Notes for a History of Brazilian Criminal Law (Batista, 2016).\n\nAlthough Zahidé Machado Neto did not directly confront sexism in her doctoral work, her later academic and political trajectory, especially the militancy in the feminist movement, is marked by a fight against oppression and gender and race violence. In addition to shifting to broader reflections in sociology (general and legal) (L. Machado Neto and Z. Machado Neto, 1966; 1978), her studies on feminism in the early 1980s are innovative (Z. Machado Neto, 1979; 1982a; 1982b; Z. Machado Neto and Simões, 1980), especially for their emphasis on north-eastern women, a theme that allows her to denounce the intersection of oppressions of gender, race, and class.\n\nThe development of research on the living and working conditions of and violence against women, and investment in public policies of gender equality, made Zahidé Machado Neto one of the forerunners in feminist studies and activism in Brazil. Her early death in 1983 resulted in her oblivion, not only in criminology but in social sciences in general, which makes it all the more important to ‘restore, in the history of Brazilian feminism, the role of the individual agency of a researcher who, in a time hostile to research on women, helped to construct a field whose fruits are still harvested today’ (Fernandes et al, 2016: 110).\n\nEster Kosovski’s Adultery (1981), based on research she conducted between 1978 and 1981, is also worth mentioning. The work is important for several reasons, especially because it includes the elements that make up the integrated critical model of criminal sciences (Lyra Filho, 1972; Muñoz Conde, 1977; Baratta, 1980), as will be explored later on.\n\nFrom a methodological point of view, Kosovski not only breaks with the dualism of the neo-Kantian tradition, using a markedly interdisciplinary approach, but also transversalises the subject through the critique of the patriarchal regime that justifies the criminalisation of adultery. Kosovski begins with a social reconstruction of patriarchy in parallel to the (legal theory) analysis of the elements of the criminal type of Article 240 of the Penal Code. Among the topics she addresses is the ‘legitimate defence of honour’, a trope that historically justified the murder of women and that, according to Kosovski, is the symptom of a culture that incites revenge and makes femicide routine in Brazil: ‘were it not for, on the one hand, the legal argument of the defence of honour in the case of adultery and, on the other hand, social complicity, the perpetuation [of femicide] could not take place’ (Kosovski, 1983: 68). The second part of the work analyses the social perception about affection and sexuality, and the changes in culture after the sexual revolution. The thesis ends with extensive fieldwork entitled ‘In the Language of the People’, an opinion poll of 496 residents of Rio de Janeiro that is complemented by statistical data about the indexes of criminal and family court cases in the State Court of Justice.\n\nBased on the results of her research, Kosovski reported that there were almost no criminal prosecutions for adultery but, despite the de facto decriminalisation, the legal incrimination produced significant effects: first, in the sphere of family law, data on adultery were used to justify legal suits on money restitution and custody of children – the investigation revealed that offenders were sent to family court instead of criminal court; and second, in the criminal field, as a kind of the genus ‘crime against honour’, adultery justified femicide (legitimate defence of honour), no doubt because the trials of these crimes were carried out by the popular court (jury). The study concludes by calling for the decriminalisation of adultery, a political-criminal proposal that was only implemented in 2005 with the publication of Law 11.106/05, an amendment to the Penal Code.\n\nThe works of Lengruber, Zahidé Machado Neto, and Kosovski inaugurated feminist criminology in Brazil. Research that, besides initiating a dialogue between critical criminological and feminist theories, anticipated problems that are still significant (gender violence and female incarceration), and indicated methodological alternatives regarding the form of investigation and political-criminal projects related to the modification of criminal law and the implementation of public policies for the protection and respect of women.\n\nThese texts also evidence a clear concern to bring to the debate the matter of race, along with the issues of gender and class. In fact, the racial issue is not only explored in the research of Lengruber and Zahidé Machado Neto, but also in other critical theoretical and empirical works, especially those that explore the system of criminal justice and the penitentiary system.\n\nCritical criminology, in its departure from the causal etiological paradigm, shifted its analysis from the classificatory dimension to the dimension of power. From a microcriminology that orbited around crime, critical criminology directs its questionings to the structural and institutional forms of violence and, consequently, to criminalisation processes. It is for this reason that selectivity and immunity are key matters in the production of critical criminologists. Due to the base theory that grounds critical criminology, the initial discussions about selectivity were especially tied to variables of class, and the racial issue was secondary, even in countries that had a history of slavery and, like Brazil, have not developed state policies for the true inclusion of black people.\n\nDespite the emphasis on the economic factor in critical criminology, Thula Pires (2016) highlights that it was ‘critical criminologists [who] demonstrated the racialization of the penal system and the racial selectivity of control promoted by the penal norm’ (Pires, 2016: 186). Even so, the diagnosis of Felipe Freitas (2016) is correct: traditionally, criminology (even critical criminology) dealt only marginally with the issue of race, limiting itself to pointing it out as another one of the effects of selectivity: greater vulnerability of black people to criminalisation and imprisonment. In Brazilian critical criminology, it is works such as those of Piza Duarte (1998) (Criminology and Racism: Introduction to Criminological Theories in Brazil) and Flauzina (2006) (Black Body Fallen to the Ground: The Penal System and the Genocidal Project of the Brazilian State) that pulled racism away from the periphery. Such research allowed criminologists to defog their lens and point out how the structural dimension of racism should be addressed: ‘racism is the structuring axis of inequalities, and criminology cannot expand its explanatory repertoire of this Brazilian phenomena while ignoring this important dimension’ (Freitas, 2016: 493). Only from this perspective is it possible to understand phenomena such as police brutality and hyperincarceration as manifestations of a policy of extermination of black people (Flauzina, 2006; Reis, 2015; Freitas, 2016; 2015; Pires, 2016).\n\nPerspectives on legal theory in the first phase of Brazilian critical criminology: the integrated critical model of criminal sciences\n\nA particular issue involving the Roman-Germanic criminal sciences is the relationship between criminal law (normative) and criminology (empirical). In common law countries, the confluence of criminology and sociology minimises disciplinary tensions, even when criminological studies take place in law schools. On the other hand, in civil law countries, the preponderance of criminal law over criminology remains, for the latter is historically understood as an auxiliary discipline. From the point of view of traditional theory, this is still an open issue because Neo-Kantianism only partially solved it.\n\nDespite recognising the specificity of method and object of the criminal and criminological disciplines, one of the tasks imposed on critical thinking was overcoming Neo-Kantian dualism. In an attempt to rescue philosophy at the beginning of the last century, in an environment dominated by naturalistic positivism, and to adapt, under the same orientation, criminal and criminological theory, neo-Kantianism established an anti-dialectical chasm between normative and empirical phenomena. In this sense, the ‘object of legal theory is the complex of the concepts, the principles, the institutes that it, in its process of abstraction, elaborates with the data provided by positive law’ (Fragoso, 1954: 184). This is different from the ‘object of criminology [which] is the research of the causes and conditions of crime, that is, the reasons that condition and originate the crimes, their “why”’ (Fragoso, 1954: 192). In these terms, a ‘divorce between being and value, between the ontological and axiological spheres’ (Muñoz Conde, 1977: 94) was established, creating ‘two epistemologically incommunicable worlds’ (Batista, 2005: 28). For Batista (2005), the construction of criminal legal theory was marked by an ‘Olympian contempt for reality’, a situation that became a ‘schizophrenic practice’ (Batista (2005): 28).\n\nThe critical project of criminal sciences sought to dialectically redefine the relationship between criminal law and criminology, and to expand its objects of exploration. For Nagel (1971), if it was the abandonment of the etiological basis that conferred a critical character on criminology, this rupture also provided the revision of its object, from then on occupying the criminological lens of violence promoted in the name of order and authority (state crimes) (Nagel (1971: 1974). From a methodological point of view, the turn was represented especially by ‘ending the incommunicability’ between criminal law theory and criminology (Andrade, 1997: 227). Moreover, criminal law itself became the object of critique (Andrade, 2012: 343).\n\nHowever, the rupture in the Neo-Kantian scheme did not imply the negation, absorption, or subjection (hierarchisation) of one discipline by another, as had occurred in the epistemological disputes of the late 19th century, especially in the hegemonic versions of Liszt and Rocco. One of the greatest achievements of critical criminology (in the Roman-Germanic tradition) was the integration of the normative (legal-criminal) and empirical (criminological-experimental) spheres.\n\nIn Brazilian critical criminology, Lyra Filho thought embryonically of this integrated critical model of criminal sciences that was later claimed by Muñoz Conde (1977), and developed masterfully by Baratta (1997; 1981), Bustos Ramirez and Hormazábal Malarré (1997), and, more recently, Vera Andrade (2012). It is a new type of system in which the empirical knowledge about criminalised subjects and selective criminalisation processes informs and guides technical work. In the first part of Dialectical Criminology (1972), Lyra Filho overcomes the internal dichotomies of criminological discourse, especially the false opposition of object and method (micro/macrocriminology), and the image of man (determinism/free will). In the second part, he takes on the relationship between criminal law and criminology and reconfigures criminal unfairness and culpability from a material interpretation that incorporates data related to criminal subcultures and judicial pluralism (Lyra Filho, 1972; de Carvalho, 2020). In the synthesis of Inocêncio Coelho (1971), Lyra Filho ‘marks original plans of communication between, on the one hand, the problem of formalization, effectiveness, and legitimacy of norms, and, on the other hand, legal works in the strict sense, breaking the dams of technicality, for the free transit of speculation, and enriching them with the scientific perspectives of criminology, which, already in itself, forms a prodigious crossroads’ (Coelho (1971: 127).\n\nIn this scenario, Giamberardino (2012) points out the two broad directions of Brazilian critique since his first formulations in the 1970s: first, the criminological critique of violence, especially structural and institutional violence; and second, legal theory’s critique of the foundations of and criteria for attributing criminal responsibility, broadly and solidly referenced by empirical data about the performance of punitive agencies (Giamberardino (2012: 233). Both perspectives (criminal and criminological) are markedly part of the horizon of investigations in critical Brazilian criminology and have achieved, in recent decades, highly productive results.\n\nThe confluence of criminology and legal-criminal theory allowed for the development of a critical criminal law that uses the data provided by criminology and transforms them into technical arguments focused on judicial practice: ‘from critical criminology it is possible to enter and review each element of criminal legal theory [theory of the criminal norm, theory of the crime, and theory of the penalty] for concrete constructions within criminal law’ (Bustos Ramirez, 1987: 24).\n\nOf the studies that confronted criminal legal theory with empirical data provided by criminology, those that stand out are Nilo Batista, Juarez Tavares, Juarez Cirino dos Santos, Maria Lúcia Karam, Heitor Costa Júnior and, as mentioned above, Ester Kosovski. Throughout the 1970s, books were published that, although still focused on the legal theory debate, already projected an integrated critical model based on empirical knowledge, conforming to what has been designated by Vera Andrade (2012) as a ‘critical and criminologically grounded guarantee’ (Andrade (2012: 99).\n\nIn this sense, the trajectory of Cirino dos Santos serves as an example: in the 1970s, a conceptual review of culpability under dialectical influx (Santos, 1974); in the 1980s and 1990s, the ‘critique of the legal theory of crime’ and the proposition of ‘an alternative theoretical model’ inspired by the inequalities of peripheral capitalism (Santos, 1985); in the 2000s, the consolidation of a theory whose\n\nfundamental presupposition of scientific concepts and political ideas’ of criminal law theory is that only real democracy can reduce the structural and institutional violence of unequal and unfair societies and, thus, reduce the personal violence of individuals deformed by adverse social conditions that are unbearable and insuperable via the usual ways of the capital/paid work relationship. (Santos, 2017: ii)\n\nThe trajectories of two other authors are not that different: Tavares (2018) elaborates a critical theory of crime that ‘confronts normative elements with empirical data to prevent the formation of a purely normative and deformed structure of crime’ (Tavares, 2018: 20), while Zaffaroni and Batista (2010) outline an analysis of crime with reductive functionality (conflictive) that aims to ‘negatively value the punitive power in general and the penalty in particular (from the denial of its manifest functions, based on the failure of legitimizing theories), and to attribute to criminal law the political task of, as a dam predisposed by the rule of law, containing the punitive flow of the state of police’ (Zaffaroni and Batista (2010: 60).\n\nFinal considerations: synthesis of methodological guidelines\n\nThe foundational research that theoretically and methodologically guides Brazilian critical criminology reveals the guidelines that have been consolidated since the 1970s. It is possible to argue, along the lines proposed by Antonio Martins (2018), that critical criminology is critical theory applied to criminal sciences (first guideline). It is an anti-positivist directive that reveals methodologies anchored in dialectics (second guideline). Thus, critical criminology and the critical theory of criminal law stand together to overcome isolationism and Neo-Kantian binaries such as must-be/being, normative/empirical, law/sociology, criminal law/criminology (third guideline). By breaking with the (false) dichotomy theory/practice, the critical model needs to be interdisciplinary in the way it addresses themes and in the multiplicity of research procedures (fourth guideline). The accusation that critical criminology, not only in Brazil, privileges theoretical studies (theoretical criminology) to the detriment of empirical research is therefore fallacious and lacking empirical demonstrability.\n\nCritical criminology re-establishes an integrated model of criminal sciences in which criminology is not reduced to the description of criminal phenomena (individual or social), and criminal law is not limited to normative systematization (fifth guideline) (Costa and de Carvalho, 2021). The dialectical overcoming of disciplinary isolationism brings about an emancipatory, libertarian, and markedly anti-authoritarian know-act (praxis) (sixth directive).\n\nIn this context, critique in criminal sciences is instrumentalised in three areas (seventh guideline): (a) critical criminal legal theory: interpretation of legal categories in defence of human rights (‘garantismo penal’ theory); (b) epistemological critique of criminal legal theory: meta-theoretical analysis of the fundamentals of the legal-criminal science; and (c) critical criminology in the strict sense: investigation of the functioning (lethal and selective) of the punitive system. The intersection between criminology and criminal legal theory represents the virtue (not the vice) of this model because ‘the critical criminologist will be a critical criminal lawyer and the criminal lawyer will be a critical criminologist as well’ (Bustos Ramirez, 1987: 538).\n\nThe link between critical criminal legal studies and critical criminology is one of the central issues today well beyond Brazil. It changes punitive grammar and has real effects on secondary criminalisation. If the theory of criminal law guides judicial practice, especially the work of magistrates, a critical criminal legal theory, guided by the data of reality, alters jurisprudence from within and, in its limits, carries out the defence of fundamental rights independently of macro projects of political change. By valuing legal theory and creating alternatives, as has been done since the 1980s (Zaffaroni and Batista, 2010; Santos, 2017; Tavares, 2018), critique is not reduced to ‘programmatic agendas’ or ‘negative critiques’, but is instead carried out as praxis.\n\nNevertheless, since Baratta’s work (2004), critique understands human rights as the object and limit of criminal law and, in this sense, explores the structural and institutional forms of (re)production of violence (state violence), integrating the micro and macro criminological spheres (eighth and ninth guidelines). By expanding the predominantly economic reading of the 1960s and 1970s (critique of capitalism), critical critique has been updated to encompass the dimensions of gender (critique of patriarchy and LGBTI-phobia) and race (critique of racism), without losing sight of the new forms of global violation of rights (financial macro crime/market crimes, environmental degradation, genocide, war crimes, crimes against humanity), according to Morrison (2006), Ferrajoli (2013), Zaffaroni (2007) and Zaffaroni and Santos (2020) (tenth guideline).\n\nNagel, already in 1971, turned the spotlight on the object of the new criminology (crimes of power) by questioning where the analysis on the bishop who blesses the cannons that destroy hundreds and thousands of people is. This is because criminologists before World War II dealt only with ‘muggers’ and the effects of ‘prison work’ (Nagel, 1971: 75). After Nuremberg, however, the ethical imperative that guides critique is the one announced by Adorno (1986): ‘let Auschwitz not be repeated’ (Adorno, 1986: 33). In Brazil, Auschwitz could be seen to be re-enacted as a symbolic image by the massacre in the Carandiru penitentiary in 1991.\n\nThis article is a translation.
