        "text": "The Federation of the Brazilian States is a federal republic consisting of 31 states, three communes (including the Autonomous City), and three islands.\n\nThe Brazilian territory comprises a contiguous territory, by the west of the Río de la Plata region to the Atlantic Forest in the east, including the islands in the Atlantic Sea, and the Amazon Rainforest in the north.\n\nThe territory of Brazil is limited by Granada by the northwest; the Andine Confederation by the west, and Argentina by the Southwest. Except for Chile and Patagonia, Brazil borders every country in South America.\n\nHistory[]\n\nThe present states of Brazil trace their history to a combination of the captaincies established by Portugal following the Treaty of Tordesillas, the Treaty of Ilhéus which conceded to the continental Brazil, treaties that defined the borders in the Amazonian region, purchases, and wars, such as the Brazilian–Dutch War for Guyana.\n\nWhen the independence was formalized, the Code of the League of Brazilian States established 12 states, Bahia, Espírito Santo, Goiás, Guanabara, Maranhão, Mato Grosso, Minas Gerais, Pará, Pernambuco, Piauí, Rio de Janeiro, Santa Catarina, São Paulo, São Pedro, and the territory of Rio Negro. When the Constitution was promulgated, the states of Paraguai and Sacramento (later renamed to Uruguai) were created, along with the establishment of the Brazilian dominion in Barbados. In 1801, the city of Rio de Janeiro, the former capital of the Colony of Brazil, became the Commune of Guanabara, and two portions of the state of Pernambuco formed the states of Ceará and Rio Grande.\n\nTreaties[]\n\nSince the establishment of the Republic, the Brazilian government was interested in the expansion of its territory. In 1814, the Treaty of Paris ceded the French territory in South America to Brazil, under negotiation between Brazilian and British diplomats. In exchange, Brazil granted to Great Britain and France to open the ports for foreign trade, and extraterritoriality for the British (relinquished in 1866). The territory was merged into the state of Pará.\n\nIn 1905, diplomats of Brazil and the United Kingdom gathered several times to resolve the question of the sovereignty of the Ascension Island, and initially, Saint Helena, and Tristan da Cunha. The question of Saint Helena and Tristan da Cunha was dropped, while the Brazilian government could reach into an agreement with the British cabinet to the transfer of Ascension Island in twenty years, allowing the United Kingdom to keep a military base on the island.\n\nWars[]\n\nThe Brazilian–Dutch War was a conflict fought between the Free State of Brazil and the United Kingdom of the Netherlands between 1833 and 1836, due to the Dutch territory in South America. Over the past decade, the Brazilian and the Dutch clashed several times in the North Atlantic Ocean. Both countries seized each other dominions on The Guianas. Despite initial Dutch victories by the sea, the war ended with the Brazilian victory after the Battle of Paramaribo. A treaty was signed by the Neerlandese and Brazilians in Belém, which ceded the Dutch territory on the Guyanas to Brazil.\n\nThe Platine War was fought between the Argentine Confederation and an alliance between the Federation of Brazilian States and the rebellious provinces of Corrientes and Entre Ríos. It happened between 1851 and 1852 and ended with the victory of Brazil, ensuring its hegemony in the Platine region. Brazil annexed a portion of the province of Corrientes. In 1870, the Brazilian Civil War was officially over after the Treaty of Iguaçu, where the Republic of Catanduva was dissolved, and Mato Grosso, as a punishment, was divided between four states: Araguaia, Cuiabá, Guaporé, and Juruena.\n\nBetween the late 19th century and the early 20th century, the Acre War was fought between Brazil, the short-lived Republic of Acre, and the Andine Confederation. The region of Acre possessed rich gold deposits and an abundance of timber, principally rubber trees, and the rise of Brazilian settlers in the region was observed by the Andine authorities, who set up a customs office, upsetting the Brazilian settlers, which set the Republic of Acre, engaging into a war between Brazil and the Andine Confederation. The war ended with Brazilian victory, and with the two nations signing the Treaty of Petrópolis, mediated by Granada.\n\nName changes[]\n\nThe first name change was from the state of Sacramento, now Uruguai. In the 1820s, there was a nativist movement in the state, led by later President Frutuoso Rivera. Following a successful movement, the state changed its name from Sacramento (from the city of Colônia do Sacramento, the first Portuguese settlement in the state) to Uruguai (the pronunciation of the Charruan word for \"the river of the urú\".\n\nThe state of São João was initially named São João das Duas Barras, but shortened to São João, though, the name is still used in official documents. The Governor himself is referred to as the Governor of the State of São João das Duas Barras (\"Governador do Estado de São João das Duas Barras\").\n\nAdministrative divisions[]\n\nStates[]\n\nFlag Federative state Abbreviation Capital Population Statehood Acre AC Penápolis 803,513 15 June 1962 Araguaia AR Paranatinga 1,037,281 01 March 1870 Bahia BH Salvador 15,794,539 9 September 1793 Ceará CE Fortaleza 8,452,381 28 April 1801 Corumbá CO Corumbá 4,651,235 3 March 1815 Cuiabá CUI Cuiabá 3,826,194 01 March 1870 Cunani CN Caiena 4,123,872 20 May 1838 Espírito Santo ES Vitória 3,929,911 9 September 1793 Goiás GO Goiânia 9,525,511 9 September 1793 Guaporé GP Porto Velho 1,768,204 01 March 1870 Guianas GU Dirceópolis 6,198,652 20 May 1838 Iguaçu IG Umuarama 4,841,235 18 September 1946 Juruena JU Sorriso 1,555,852 01 March 1870 Madeira MD Manaus 3,537,653 18 September 1946 Maranhão MA São Luís 6,574,789 9 September 1793 Minas Gerais MG Belo Horizonte 18,286,645 9 September 1793 Palmares PL Cidade dos Palmares 5,583,869 20 May 1838 Pará PA Belém 8,578,051 9 September 1793 Paraná PN Paranaguá 7,444,727 29 August 1853 Pernambuco PE Recife 13,317,375 9 September 1793 Piauí PI Teresina 3,204,028 9 September 1793 Rio de Janeiro RJ Niterói 8,358,286 9 September 1793 Rio Grande RG Porto Alegre 11,286,500 9 September 1793 Roraima RR São Joaquim 505,665 15 June 1962 Santa Catarina SC Ondina 6,819,190 9 September 1793 São Francisco SF Barreiras 2,078,525 13 September 1943 São João SJ Palmas 1,572,866 14 September 1821 São Paulo SP Campinas 24,676,110 9 September 1793 São Roque SR Natal 3,442,175 28 April 1801 Solimões SL Tefé 606,944 18 September 1946 Tapajós TP Santarém 1,721,818 18 September 1946 Triângulo TR Uberlândia 2,882,146 27 July 1820 Uruguai UR Sacramento 9,128,741 25 August 1800\n\nCommunes[]\n\nFlag Official name Abbreviation Cities Population Autonomy Capital Largest Autonomous City of Trindade CA Trindade 564,290 25 August 1800 Commune of Guanabara GB Rio de Janeiro 10,191,738 28 April 1801 Commune of Piratininga PT São Paulo 21,242,939 26 November 2008\n\nIslands[]\n\nFlag Official name Abbreviation Cities Area Population Established Capital Largest Barbados BR São Michel 439 km² 277,821 - Ilha da Ascenção AS João da Nova 88 km² 1,206 - Fernando de Noronha FN Fernando de Noronha 17 km² 3,061 -\n\nFormer administrative divisions[]"
