Yet, the city has historically and currently been the home of Black collective action, cultural production, and Black life. This article focuses on the “I Africanize São Paulo” T-shirt, its designer, and photo campaign. Rather than consider São Paulo antithetical to Black aesthetic and cultural production, I find that the “I Africanize São Paulo” T-shirt demonstrates a form of Afro-aesthetics that emerges from São Paulo’s tradition of Black politics and culture. I focus on the history of Black political and cultural activity that preceded the T-shirt production as well as the factors that contribute to the obfuscation of Black culture in the city."
