        "text": "Overview of race and ethnicity in Brazil\n\nBrazilian society is made up of a confluence of people of Indigenous, Portuguese, and African descent. Other major significant groups include Italians, Spaniards, Germans, Lebanese, and Japanese.[1]\n\nLatin Europe accounted for four-fifths of the arrivals[when?] (2.25 million Portuguese,[2] 1.5 million Italians, and 700,000 Spaniards).\n\nBrazil has seen greater racial equality over time. According to a recent review study, \"There has been major, albeit uneven, progress in these terms since slavery, which has unfortunately not wholly translated into equality of income: only in 2011 did the black-to-white income ratio eclipse its 1960 level, although it appears to be at an all-time high. Education and migration were important factors in closing the gap, whereas school quality and discrimination may explain its persistence.\"[3]\n\nHistoric background\n\n[edit]\n\nThe Brazilian population was formed by the influx of Portuguese settlers and African slaves, mostly Bantu and West African populations[4] (such as the Yoruba, Ewe, and Fanti-Ashanti), into a territory inhabited by various indigenous South American tribal populations, mainly Tupi, Guarani and Ge.[5]\n\nIn the late 19th and early 20th centuries, in what is known as Great Immigration,[6] new groups arrived, mainly of Portuguese, Italian, Spanish and German origin, but also from Japan, the Middle East, and Eastern Europe.[1]\n\nWhen the Portuguese reached what is now called Brazil in 1500, its native population was probably composed of about 2.5 million Amerindians.[7] Up to 1532, the Portuguese made no real effort to colonise the land, limiting to the establishment of \"feitorias\" to organise the trade of brazilwood.[8]\n\nWhen it became clear that this policy would result in the land being taken by other European powers, namely the French and the Dutch, the Portuguese Crown decided to effectively occupy the territory by fostering agricultural activities, especially sugarcane crops, in Brazil.[9] This resulted not only in the growth of the population of Portuguese origin, but also in the introduction of African slavery in Brazil.[9]\n\nDuring the colonial period, the Portuguese prohibited any influx of other Europeans to Brazil.[10] In consequence, the Portuguese and their descendants constituted the overwhelming majority of the White population of colonial Brazil.[11] However, in the Southern Brazilian areas disputed between Portugal and Spain, a genetic study suggests that the predominant genomic ancestry of the Brazilian Gaúchos (inhabitants of the Pampas) may be Spanish, not Portuguese.[12][13]\n\nAlso a small number of Dutch settlers remained in the Northeast after the Portuguese retook Dutch Brazil[14] and may have contributed to the demographic composition of Northeastern Brazil.[15] Even then and after the country's independence in 1822, immigration to Brazil was mainly Portuguese, though a significant number of German immigrants settled in the Southern region.[1]\n\nEuropean, Arab and East Asian immigration\n\n[edit]\n\nCombined with the European demographic crisis[clarification needed], this resulted in the immigration of about 5 million people, mostly European peasants, in the last quarter of the 19th century and first half of the 20th. The majority of these immigrants were either Portuguese or Italian (about 1,500,000 each), though significant numbers of Spaniards, which possibly include Portuguese emigrating from Vigo on false passports[16] (690,000), Germans (250,000), Japanese (170,000), Middle Easterns (100,000, mostly people from what are now Syria and Lebanon arriving on Turkish passports), and Eastern Europeans (mostly Poles and Ukrainians arriving on Russian passports) also immigrated.[1]\n\nThere are few reliable statistics on the Brazilian population before the 1872 census, in Brazil of 1872 were:\n\n3,787,289 Whites (European mainly)[17]\n\n4,188,737 Mixed-race (Pardo)\n\n1,954,452 Blacks (African)\n\nThese figures do not yet reflect the influx of the five million immigrants mentioned above[clarification needed], since up to 1872 only about 270,000 immigrants had arrived in Brazil.[18] According to Judicael Clevelário's calculations, the total population of immigrant origin in 1872 would be of about 240,000 people;[19] consequently, the total White population of non-immigrant origin for that year would be of about 3,540,000 people at least.\n\nIn the 2010 census, Whites were the largest single group, but not the majority. In 2010, the ethnic backgrounds of Brazilians were:\n\n91,051,646 Whites (European mainly)[20]\n\n82,277,333 Mixed-race (Pardo)\n\n14,517,961 Blacks (African)\n\n2,084,288 East Asians (Japanese mainly)\n\n817,963 Indigenous (Native)\n\nOrigin Period 1830–1855 1856–1883 1884–1893 1894–1903 1904–1913 1914–1923 1924–1933 Portuguese 16,737 116,000 170,621 155,542 384,672 201,252 233,650 Italians — 100,000 510,533 537,784 196,521 86,320 70,177 Spaniards — — 113,116 102,142 224,672 94,779 52,405 Germans 2,008 30,000 22,778 6,698 33,859 29,339 61,723 Japanese — — — — 11,868 20,398 110,191 Levantines — — 96 7,124 45,803 20,400 20,400 Others — — 66,524 42,820 109,222 51,493 164,586\n\nAbolition of slavery (1888)\n\n[edit]\n\nFurther information: Slavery in Brazil\n\nThere seems to be no easy explanation of why slaves were not employed as wage workers at the abolition of slavery[citation needed]. One possibility is the influence of race-based ideas from the second half of the 19th and early 20th centuries, which were based on theories of White superiority[citation needed]. On the other hand, Brazilian latifundiaries had been using slave manpower for centuries, with no complaints about the quality of this workforce, and there were not important changes in Brazilian economy or work processes that could justify such sudden preoccupation with the \"race\" of the labourers[citation needed]. Their embracing of those new identitarian ideas, moreover, proved quite flexible, even opportunist: with the slowdown of Italian immigration since 1902 and the Prinetti Decree, Japanese immigration started in 1908, with any qualms about their typically non-European origins being quickly forgotten[citation needed].\n\nAn important, and usually ignored, part of this equation was the political situation in Brazil, during the final crisis of slavery. According to Petrônio Domingues, by 1887 the slave struggles pointed to a real possibility of widespread insurrection. On October 23, in São Paulo, for instance, there were violent confrontations between the police and rioting Blacks, who chanted \"long live freedom\" and \"death to the slaveowners\".[21]: 73 The president of the province, Rodrigues Alves, reported the situation as following:\n\nThe massive flight of slaves from several fazendas threatens, in some places in the province, public order, alarming the proprietaries and the productive classes.[21]: 74\n\nUprisings erupted in Itu, Campinas, Indaiatuba, Amparo, Piracicaba and Capivari; ten thousand fugitive slaves grouped in Santos. Fights were happening in daylight, guns were spotted among the fugitives, who, instead of hiding from police, seemed ready to engage in confrontation[citation needed].\n\nIt was as a response to such events that, on May 13, 1888, slavery was abolished, as a means to restore order and the control of the ruling class,[21]: 76 in a situation in which the slave system was almost completely disorganised[citation needed].\n\nAs an abolitionist newspaper, O Rebate, put it, ten years later,\n\nHadn't the slaves fled massively from the plantations, rebelling against the masters ... Hadn't they, in more than 20,000, gone to the famous quilombo of Jabaquara (out of Santos, itself a center of abolitionist agitation), and maybe they would today be still slaves ... Slavery ended because slaves no longer wanted to be slaves, because slaves rebelled against their masters and against the law that enslaved them ... The law of 13 May was nothing more than the legal recognition – so that public authority wasn't discredited – of an act that had already been accomplished by the mass revolt of slaves.[22]\n\nAnother factor, also usually neglected, is the fact that, regardless of the racial notions of the Brazilian elite, European populations were emigrating in great numbers – to the United States, to Argentina, to Uruguay – which African populations certainly were not doing, at that time. In this respect, what was new in \"immigration to Brazil\" was not the \"immigration\", but the \"to Brazil\" part. As Wilson do Nascimento Barbosa puts it,\n\nThe collapse of slavery was the economic result of three conjugated movements: a) the end of the first industrial revolution (1760–1840) and the beginning of the so-called second industrial revolution (1880–1920); b) the lowering of the reproduction costs of the White man in Europe (1760–1860), due to the sanitary and pharmacological impact of the first industrial revolution; c) the rising costs of African Black slaves, due to the increasing reproduction costs of Black men in Africa.[23]\n\nRacial and ethnic theories\n\n[edit]\n\nImmigration discussion and policy in the 19th century\n\n[edit]\n\nSee also: Immigration to Brazil\n\nIn Brazil, particularly in São Paulo, the dominant idea was that national workers were unable to develop the country, and that only foreign workers would be able to work in a regime of \"free\" (i.e., wage) labour. The goal was to \"whiten\" Brazil through new immigrants and through future genetic mixing in which former slaves would disappear by becoming \"Whiter.\"[24]\n\nIn 1878, ten years before the abolition of slavery, Rio de Janeiro hosted the Congresso Agrícola (Agricultural Congress) and that meeting reflected what the Brazilian elite (especially coffee planters) expected from their future workers.[25] Although national workers were an option to some of the participants, especially to those not from São Paulo, most of them, under the lead of coffee planters from São Paulo, agreed that only immigration would be good to Brazil,[26] and, moreover, European immigration. The Congresso Agrícola showed that the elite was convinced that Europeans were racially and culturally superior to other races.\n\nAlthough discussions were situated in a theoretical field, immigrants arrived and colonies were founded through all this period (the rule of Pedro II), especially from 1850 on, particularly in the Southeast and Southern Brazil. These discussions culminated in the Decree 528 in 1890, signed by Brazil's first President Deodoro da Fonseca, which opened the national harbors to immigration except for Africans and Asians.[27] This decree remained valid until October 5, 1892 when, due to pressures of coffee planters interested in cheap manpower, it was overturned by Law 97, which allowed the entry of Japanese immigrants to work on the coffee plantations, because, until that moment, the Brazilian ports could receive Whites only, who came mainly from Europe and the Middle East.[28]\n\nAs a result of those discussions and policies,[29] Brazil experienced immigration mostly from countries such as Portugal, Italy, Spain, Germany, France, Poland, Russia, Ukraine, etc, during the end of the empire and the beginning of the republic period (late 19th and early 20th centuries). Later immigration, from 1908 on, was not so much influenced by that race discussions and Brazil attracted, besides Europeans, more immigrants from Lebanon, Syria and Japan, for example.[30][31]\n\nOliveira Vianna and the ideology of \"Whitening\"\n\n[edit]\n\nSee also: Racial whitening\n\nRacial whitening, or \"whitening\" (branqueamento), is an ideology that was widely accepted in Brazil between 1889 and 1914,[32] as the solution to the \"Negro problem.\"[33][34] The Brazilian government, as was commonplace at that time, endorsed positions expressed by Brazilian intellectuals and scientists. An example is a text, written by Oliveira Vianna, that was issued as introductory material to 1920 Census results. Many pages of Vianna's work were dedicated to the discussion of a \"pure race\" of white Brazilians. According to the text, written by Oliveira Vianna, the first Portuguese colonists who came to Brazil were part of the blond Germanic nobility that ruled Portugal, while the dark-haired \"poor\" Portuguese only came to Brazil later, in the 17th and especially the 18th century.[35]\n\nAccording to Oliveira Vianna, the blond Portuguese of Germanic origin were \"restless and migratory\", and that's why they emigrated to Brazil. On the other hand, the Portuguese of darker complexions were of Celtic or Iberian origin and came when the Portuguese settlement in Brazil was already well established, because, according to him, \"The peninsular brachyoids, of Celtic race, or the dolicoides, of Iberian race, of sedentary habits and peaceful nature, did not have, of course, that mobility nor that bellicosity nor that spirit of adventure and conquest.\"[35]\n\nThe text reported the different levels of intelligence found among blacks and highlights the existence of \"lazy blacks\" (Gêgis and Angolans) or \"laborious blacks\" (Timinins, Minas, Dahomeyanos) and also the existence of \"peaceful and obedient blacks\" and of \"rebels and fierce\" ones. Vianna also compares the \"morality\" and intellectual level found among blacks and reports that Gêgis, Krumanos and Cabindas revealed the \"mental inferiority, typical from the lowest types of the black race.\"[35]\n\nGilberto Freyre's work\n\n[edit]\n\nIn 1933, Brazilian anthropologist Gilberto Freyre published his famous book Casa-Grande & Senzala (The Masters and the Slaves). The book appeared at a moment when there was a widespread belief among social scientists that some races were superior to other ones, and in the same period when the Nazi Party in Germany was on the rise. Freyre's work was very important to change the mentality, especially of the white Brazilian elite,[36] who considered the Brazilian people as \"inferior\" because of their African and Amerindian ancestry. In this book, Freyre argued against the idea that Brazil would have an \"inferior race\" because of the race-mixing.\n\nThen, he pointed the positive elements that permeate the Brazilian cultural formation because of genetic mixing (especially between Portuguese, Amerindians and Blacks). Freyre's book has changed the mentality in Brazil, and the mixing of races, then, became a reason to be a national pride. However, Freyre's book created the Brazilian myth of the Racial democracy, which held that Brazil was a \"post-racial\" country without identitarianism or desire to preserve one's European ancestry. This theory was later challenged by several anthropologists who claim that, despite the race-mixing, the white Brazilian population still occupies the top of the Brazilian society, while Blacks, Indians and mixed-race people are largely found in the poor population.\n\nGilberto Freyre on the criticisms that he received\n\n[edit]\n\nThe life of Gilberto Freyre, after he published Casa-Grande & Senzala, became an eternal source of explanation. He repeated several times that he did not create the myth of a racial democracy and that the fact that his books recognized the intense mixing between \"races\" in Brazil did not mean a lack of prejudice or discrimination.\n\nHe pointed out that many people have claimed the United States to have been an \"exemplary democracy\" whereas slavery and racial segregation were present throughout most of the history of the United States.[37]\n\n\"The interpretation of those who want to place me among the sociologists or anthropologists who said prejudice of race among the Portuguese or the Brazilians never existed is extreme. What I have always suggested is that such prejudice is minimal ... when compared to that which is still in place elsewhere, where laws still regulate relations between Europeans and other groups\".\n\n\"It is not that racial prejudice or social prejudice related to complexion are absent in Brazil. They exist. But no one here would have thought of \"white-only\" Churches. No one in Brazil would have thought of laws against interracial marriage ... Fraternal spirit is stronger among Brazilians than racial prejudice, colour, class or religion. It is true that equality has not been reached since the end of slavery ...\n\nThere was racial prejudice among plantation owners, there was social distance between the masters and the slaves, between whites and blacks ... But few wealthy Brazilians were as concerned with racial purity as were the majority of Anglo-Americans in the Old South.\"[37]\n\nRacial legislation\n\n[edit]\n\nDuring the 19th century, there were some instances of legally formalized racism.[38] In 1809, when a provincial militia was formed in Rio Grande do Sul, it was established that the members should be \"White\", this being defined as \"those whose great-grandparents were not Black, and whose parents were free-born\".[39]\n\nOn July 28, 1921, representatives Andrade Bezerra and Cincinato Braga proposed a law whose Article 1 provided: \"It is prohibited in Brazil immigration of individuals from the black race.\" On October 22, 1923, representative Fidélis Reis produced another project of law on the entry of immigrants, whose fifth article was as follows: 'It is prohibited the entry of settlers from the black race in Brazil and, to Asians, it will be allowed each year, a number equal to 5% of those existing in the country.(...)'. Both bills were decried as identitarian and rejected by the Brazilian Congress.[40]\n\nIn 1945, the Brazilian government issued a decree favoring the entrance of European immigrants in the country: \"In the admission of immigrants, the need to preserve and develop, in the ethnic composition of the population, the more convenient features of their European ancestry shall be considered\".[41]\n\nGenetic mixing between ancestral groups\n\n[edit]\n\nFurther information: Pardo Brazilian and Mixed-race Brazilian\n\nThe degree of genetic mixing between ancestral groups in Brazil has been very high, as Brazil was colonized by male Portuguese adventurers who tended to procreate with Amerindian and African women.[42] This made possible a myth of \"racial democracy\" that tends to obscure a widespread discrimination connected to certain aspects of physical appearance:[43][44] aspects related to the concept of cor (\"colour\"), used in a way that is roughly equivalent to the English term \"race\" but based on a combination of skin colour, hair type, shape of nose and lips, and even clearly cultural phenomena such as neighborhood of residence, linguistic habits and class. It is possible for siblings to belong to different \"colour\" categories.[45] So a \"White\" Brazilian may be understood as a person perceived and socially accepted as \"White\", and thus \"white\" potentially regardless of ancestry or sometimes even immediate family.[46] Nonetheless, and in conjunction with recent emphases on genetic testing, a variety of social movements, government programs, and academic and popular initiatives have led to an increasing emphasis on historicity and ancestry in racial identification in Brazil and this has tended to counteract what many commentators have long sought to characterize—perhaps incorrectly, perhaps correctly, as a Brazilian racial mutability or malleability.[47]\n\nThe patterns of racialized \"assortative mating\" in Brazil are complex. The genome of the first generation offspring of European fathers and African mothers was 50% European and 50% African, but the distribution of the genes that affect visible features (skin colour, hair type, lip shape, nose shape) was random. Those of the second generation with features considered closer to a \"White\" stereotype would have tended to procreate with others like themselves, while those considered closer to \"Black\" would also have tended to procreate among themselves; in the long term producing \"White\" and \"Black\" groups with surprisingly similar proportions of European and African ancestry.[48]\n\nIBGE's racial categories\n\n[edit]\n\nThe Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics (IBGE), which has conducted censuses in Brazil since 1940, racially classifies the Brazilian population in five categories: Branco (White), \"Pardo\" (Multiracial), Preto (Black), Amarelo/Asiático (Yellow/Asian), and Indígena (Indigenous). As in international practice,[50] individuals are asked to self identify within these categories.\n\nThe following are the results for the different Brazilian censuses, since 1872:\n\nBrazilian Population, by Race, from 1872 to 2022 (Census Data) Race or Color Brancos (\"whites\") Pardos (\"mixed\") Pretos (\"blacks\") Caboclos (\"indig­enous\"/ ​\"mestizo\") Amarelos (\"yellow\"/ ​\"East Asian\") Indig­enous Unde­clared Total 1872 3,787,289 3,801,782 1,954,452 386,955 - - - 9,930,478 1890 6,302,198 4,638,496 2,097,426 1,295,795 - - - 14,333,915 1940 26,171,778 8,744,365 6,035,869 - 242,320 - 41,983 41,236,315 1950 32,027,661 13,786,742 5,692,657 - 329,082 - 108,255 51,944,397 1960 42,838,639 20,706,431 6,116,848 - 482,848 - 46,604 70,191,370 1980 64,540,467 46,233,531 7,046,906 - 672,251 - 517,897 119,011,052 1991[51] 75,704,927 62,316,064 7,335,136 - 630,656 294,135 534,878 146,815,796 2000[52] 91,298,042 65,318,092 10,554,336 - 761,583 734,127 1,206,675 169,872,856 2010[53] 91,051,646 82,277,333 14,517,961 - 2,084,288 817,963 6,608 190,755,799 2022[54] 88,252,121 92,083,286 20,656,458 - 850,130 1,227,642 203,080,756 Race or Color Brancos Pardos Pretos Caboclos Amarelos Indig­enous Unde­clared Total 1872 38.14% 38.28% 19.68% 3.90% - - - 100% 1890 43.97% 32.36% 14.63% 9.04% - - - 100% 1940 63.47% 21.21% 14.64% - 0.59% - 0.10% 100% 1950 61.66% 26.54% 10.96% - 0.63% - 0.21% 100% 1960 61.03% 29.50% 8.71% - 0.69% - 0.07% 100% 1980 54.23% 38.85% 5.92% - 0.56% - 0.44% 100% 1991 51.56% 42.45% 5.00% - 0.43% 0.20% 0.36% 100% 2000 53.74% 38.45% 6.21% - 0.45% 0.43% 0.71% 100% 2010 47.73% 43.13% 7.61% - 1.09% 0.43% 0.00% 100% 2022 43.46% 45.34% 10.17% - 0.42% 0.60% 100%\n\n^1 The 1900, 1920, and 1970 censuses did not count people for \"race\".\n\n^2 In the 1872 census, people were counted based on self-declaration, except for slaves, who were classified by their owners.[55]\n\n^3 The 1872 and 1890 censuses counted \"caboclos\" (White-Amerindian mixed race people) apart.[56] In the 1890 census, the category \"pardo\" was replaced with \"mestiço\".[56] Figures for 1890 are available at the IBGE site.[57]\n\n^4 In the 1940 census, people were asked for their \"color or race\"; if the answer was not \"White\", \"Black\", or \"Yellow\", interviewers were instructed to fill the \"color or race\" box with a slash. These slashes were later totaled in the category \"pardo\". In practice this means answers such as \"pardo\", \"moreno\", \"mulato\", \"caboclo\", etc.[58]\n\n^5 In the 1950 census, the category \"pardo\" was included on its own. Amerindians were counted as \"pardos\".[59]\n\n^6 The 1960 census adopted a similar system, again explicitly including Amerindians as \"pardos\".[60]\n\nControversy\n\n[edit]\n\nAs the IBGE itself acknowledges, these categories are disputed, and most of the population dislike it and do not identify with them.[61]: 1 Most Brazilians see \"Indígena\" as a cultural rather than racial term, and don't identify as such if they are part of the mainstream Brazilian culture; many Brazilians would prefer to self-describe as \"morenos\" (used in the sense of \"tanned\" or \"brunettes\");[62] some Black and parda people, more identified with the Brazilian Black movement, would prefer to self-describe as \"Negro\" as an inclusive category containing pardos and pretos;[61]: 2 and if allowed to choose any classification, Brazilians will give almost 200 different answers.[61]: 4\n\nAccording to the American scholar Edward Telles,[63] in Brazil there are three different systems related to \"racial classification\" along the White-Black continuum.[64]: 80–81 The first is the Census System, which distinguishes three categories: \"branco\" (White), \"pardo\", and \"preto\" (Black).[64]: 81 The second is the popular system that uses many different categories, including the ambiguous term \"moreno\"[64]: 82 (\"tanned\", \"brunette\", or \"with an olive complexion\").[65] The third is the Black movement system that distinguishes only two categories, summing up \"pardos\" and \"pretos\" as \"negros\".[64] More recently, the term \"afrodescendente\" has been brought into use.[66]\n\nThe first system referred by Telles is that of the IBGE. In the census, respondents choose their race or color in five categories: branca (white), parda (multiracial), preta (black), amarela (yellow) or indígena (indigenous). The term \"parda\" needs further explanation; it has been systematically used since the census of 1940. People were then asked for their \"colour or race\"; if the answer was not \"White\", \"Black\", or \"Yellow\", interviewers were instructed to fill the \"colour or race\" box with a slash. These slashes were later summed up in the category \"pardo\". In practice this means answers such as \"pardo\", \"moreno\", \"mulato\", and \"caboclo\". In the following censuses, \"pardo\" became a category on its own, and included Amerindians,[59] which became a separate category only in 1991. The term describes people who have a skin darker than Whites and lighter than Blacks, but doesn't necessarily imply a White-Black mixture.\n\nTelles' second system is that of popular classification. Two IBGE surveys (the 1976 PNAD and the July 1998 PME) have sought to understand the way Brazilians think of themselves in \"racial\" terms, with the explicit aim of adjusting the census classification (neither, however, resulted in actual changes in the census). Besides that, Data Folha has also conducted research on this subject. The results of these surveys are somewhat varied, but seem to coincide in some fundamental aspects. First, there is an enormous variety of \"racial\" terms in use in Brazil; when Brazilians are inquired in an open ended question, from 135 to 500 different race-color terms may be brought. The 1976 PNAD found 136 different answers to the question about race;[67] the July 1998 PME found 143.[68]: 18 However, most of these terms are used by very small minorities. Telles remarks that 95% of the population chose only six different terms (branco, moreno, pardo, moreno-claro, preto and negro); Petrucelli shows that the 7 most common responses (the above plus amarela) sum up 97%, and the 10 more common (the previous plus mulata, clara, and morena-escura) make 99%.[68]: 19\n\nPetrucelli, analysing the July 98 PME, finds that 77 denominations were mentioned by only one person in the sample. Other 12 are misunderstandings, referring to national or regional origin (francesa, italiana, baiana, cearense). Many of the \"racial\" terms are (or could be) remarks about the relation between skin colour and exposure to sun (amorenada, bem morena, branca-morena, branca-queimada, corada, bronzeada, meio morena, morena-bronzeada, morena-trigueira, morenada, morenão, moreninha, pouco morena, queimada, queimada de sol, tostada, rosa queimada, tostada). Others are clearly variations of the same idea (preto, negro, escuro, crioulo, retinto, for Black, alva, clara, cor-de-leite, galega, rosa, rosada, pálida, for White, parda, mulata, mestiça, mista, for \"parda\"), or precisions of the same concept (branca morena, branca clara), and can actually grouped together with one of the main racial terms without falsifying the interpretation.[68]: 19 Some seem to express an outright refusal of classification: azul-marinho (navy blue), azul (blue), verde (green), cor-de-burro-quando-foge (literally, \"the color of a donkey that has run away\", a humorous Portuguese term for a color that cannot be determined).\n\nPetrucelli grouped those 136 terms into 28 wider categories.[68]: 47 Most of these 28 wider categories can be situated in the White-Black continuum when the answers to the open-ended question are compared to the answers in the IBGE format:\n\nCategory Frequency White Mixed-race Black Amerindian Yellow Total difference between White and Black branca (White) 54.28% 98.96% 0.73% 0.11% 0.07% 0.14% 100.00% 98,85 loira (Blonde) 0.05% 95.24% 0.00% 4.76% 0.00% 0.00% 100.00% 90,48 brasileira (Brazilian) 0.12% 91.20% 6.05% 2.27% 0.00% 0.47% 100.00% 88,93 branca + (adjectivated White) 0.14% 86.47% 9.62% 0.00% 3.91% 0.00% 100.00% 86,47 clara (of light colour) 0.78% 86.40% 11.93% 0.35% 0.14% 1.18% 100.00% 86,05 galega (Galician) 0.01% 70.99% 19.78% 0.00% 0.00% 9.23% 100.00% 70,99 castanha (Brown) 0.01% 63.81% 36.19% 0.00% 0.00% 0.00% 100.00% 63,81 morena clara (light Morena) 2.92% 38.35% 57.12% 1.46% 2.27% 0.81% 100.00% 36,89 jambo 0.02% 14.47% 77.96% 2.39% 5.18% 0.00% 100.00% 12,08 morena 20.89% 13.75% 76.97% 6.27% 2.62% 0.38% 100.00% 7,48 mestiça, mista (miscegenated, mixed) 0.08% 17.29% 59.44% 14.96% 7.60% 0.70% 100.00% 2,33 parda (multiracial) 10.40% 1.03% 97.25% 1.40% 0.21% 0.10% 100.00% −0,37 sarará 0.04% 9.09% 60.14% 23.25% 0.00% 7.53% 100.00% −14,16 canela (of the colour of cinnamon) 0.01% 11.13% 57.55% 26.45% 4.87% 0.00% 100.00% −15,32 mulata (Mulatto) 0.81% 1.85% 71.53% 25.26% 1.37% 0.00% 100.00% −23,41 marrom, chocolate (Brown, chocolate) 0.03% 4.56% 57.30% 38.14% 0.00% 0.00% 100.00% −33,58 morena escura (dark Morena) 0.45% 2.77% 54.80% 38.05% 4.15% 0.24% 100.00% −35,28 escura (of dark colour) 0.38% 0.59% 16.32% 81.67% 1.42% 0.00% 100.00% −81,08 negra (Black) 3.14% 0.33% 6.54% 92.62% 0.50% 0.02% 100.00% −92,29 preta (Black) 4.26% 0.37% 1.73% 97.66% 0.17% 0.06% 100.00% −97,29\n\nThe other categories, except, naturally, for \"amarela\" (Yellow) seem related to Amerindian \"race\":\n\nCategory Frequency White Mixed-race Black Amerindian Yellow Total vermelha (Red) 0.02% 58.97 8.22 0.00 21.56 11.24 100.00 cafusa 0.01% 6.02 65.14 22.82 6.02 0.00 100.00 caboverde (Capeverdian) 0.02% 0.00 48.72 23.08 28.21 0.00 100.00 cabocla 0.02% 3.60 49.37 10.43 36.60 0.00 100.00 bugre (Indian) 0.00% 12.50 37.50 0.00 50.00 0.00 100.00 amarela (Yellow) 1.11% 3.27 0.98 0.24 0.15 95.36 100.00 indígena (Indigenous) 0.13% 0.44 2.12 0.00 96.13 1.30 100.00\n\nThe remarkable difference of the popular system is the use of the term \"moreno\". This is actually difficult to translate into English, and carries a few different meanings. Derived from Latin maurus, meaning inhabitant of Mauritania,[68]: 14 traditionally it is used as a term to distinguish White people with dark hair, as opposed to \"ruivo\" (redhead) and \"loiro\" (blonde).[69] It is also commonly used as a term for people with an olive complexion, a characteristic that is often found in connection with dark hair.[70] In connection to this, it is used as a term for suntanned people, and is commonly opposed to \"pálido\" (pale) and \"amarelo\" (yellow), which in this case refer to people who aren't frequently exposed to sun. Finally, it is also often used as a euphemism for \"pardo\" and \"preto\".[71]\n\nFinally, the Black movement system, in direct opposition to the popular system, groups \"pardos\" and \"pretos\" in a single category, \"negro\" (and not Afro-Brazilian).[72] This looks more similar to the American racial perception,[73] but there are some subtle differences. First, as other Brazilians, the Black movement understands that not everybody with some African descent is Black,[74] and that many or most White Brazilians indeed have African (or Amerindian, or both) ancestrals – so a \"one-drop rule\" isn't what the Black movement envisages.[75]\n\nRace and class\n\n[edit]\n\nAnother important discussion is the relation between social class and \"race\" in Brazil. It is commonplace to say that, in Brazil, \"money whitens.\"[76] There is a persistent belief, both in academy and popularly, that Brazilians from the wealthier classes with darker phenotypes tend to see themselves and be seen by others in lighter categories. Other things, such as dressing and social status, also influence perceptions of race.\n\nHowever, some studies, focusing in the difference between self- and alter-classification show that this phenomenon is far more complex than \"money whitens\". For instance, according to a study conducted by Paula Miranda-Ribeiro and André Junqueira Caetano among women in Recife, while there is significant inconsistency between the \"parda\" and \"preta\" categories, most women are consistently classified by themselves and interviewers into \"brancas\" and non-brancas. 21.97% of women were consistently classified as White, and 55.13% of women were consistently classified as non-White, while 22.89% of women where inconsistently classified.\n\nBut the inconsistently classified women reveal an important aspect of economic \"whitening\". \"Self-darkening\" women, i.e., those who view themselves as \"pretas\" or \"pardas\" but are classified as \"brancas\" by the interviewers (4.08% of women) have above average education, while the 18.82% \"self-whitening\" women have a low average education, lower indeed than that of consistently non-White women.[77]\n\nThis, assuming, that there is a correlation between wealth and education,[77] would show that, rather than \"Brazilians from the wealthier classes with darker phenotypes seeing themselves and being seen by others in lighter categories\", either wealth affects their perception by others, but does not affect, or at least affects considerably less, their self-perception, or that wealth in fact affects their self-perception in the opposite way: it is poor people who are more prone to self-whitening. This, naturally, contributes to show that self-classification in censuses is in fact more objective than alter-classification; but most importantly, it shows that economic differences between Whites and non-Whites effectively exist.\n\nIt is important to notice that the alter-classification in this survey was made by a group of college students, i.e., mostly middle-class people.\n\nDavid de Micheli argues that the recent phenomenon of racial reclassification toward blackness is a result of the expansion of public education.[78]\n\nRacial disparities\n\n[edit]\n\nThere are important differences in social position concerning \"races\". These differences encompass income, education, housing, etc. According to the 2010 IBGE Census, White workers wages were almost twice those of Blacks and \"Pardos\" (Multiracial). The illiteracy rate among White people over 5 years old was 5.9%; among Blacks, 14.4%, and among \"Pardos\" (Multiracial), 13%. The 2010 IBGE Census shows that Whites also dominate higher education in Brazil, considering the age group between 15 and 24 years old, 31.1% of the White population attended university. In relation to \"Pardos\" (Multiracial) and Blacks, the rates are 13.4% and 12.8%, respectively.[79]\n\nAccording to the 2007 Brazilian national resource, the White workers had an average monthly income almost twice that of Blacks and \"Pardos\" (Multiracial). The Blacks and Mixed-race earned on average 1.8 minimum wages, while the Whites had a yield of 3.4 minimum wages. Among workers with over 12 years of study, the difference was also large. While the Whites earned on average R$15.90 per hour, the Blacks and Mixed-race received R$11.40, when they worked the same period. Among the 1% richest population of Brazil, only 12% were Blacks and Mixed-race, while Whites constituted 86.3% of the group. In the 10% poorest there were 73.9% of Blacks and Mixed-race, and 25.5% of Whites.\n\n45.3% of the Brazilian population identify as Brown/Mixed-race. Those that identify themselves as White form 43.5%, the Black 10.2%, the Indigenous 0.8% and the East Asian 0.4%, according to the IBGE. The region with the highest proportion of Mixed-race is the North, with 67.2%. The population of the Northeast is composed of 13.0% of Blacks, the largest proportion. In the South, 72.6% of the population is White.[80]\n\nGenetic studies\n\n[edit]\n\nAutosomal studies\n\n[edit]\n\nGenetic research on ancestry of Brazilians of different races has extensively shown that, regardless of skin colour, Brazilians generally have European, African, and Amerindian ancestors.\n\nA 2015 autosomal genetic study, which also analysed data of 25 studies of 38 different Brazilian populations concluded that: European ancestry accounts for 62% of the heritage of the population, followed by the African (21%) and the Native American (17%). The European contribution is highest in Southern Brazil (77%), the African highest in Northeast Brazil (27%) and the Native American is the highest in Northern Brazil (32%).[81]\n\nRegion[81] European African Native American North Region 51% 16% 32% Northeast Region 58% 27% 15% Central-West Region 64% 24% 12% Southeast Region 67% 23% 10% South Region 77% 12% 11% Brazil 62% 21% 17%\n\nAn autosomal study from 2013, with nearly 1300 samples from all of the Brazilian regions, found a predominant degree of European ancestry combined with significant African and small Native American contributions, in varying degrees. 'Following an increasing North to South gradient, European ancestry was the most prevalent in all urban populations (with values up to 74%). The populations in the North consisted of a significant proportion of Native American ancestry that was about two times higher than the African contribution. Conversely, in the Northeast, Center-West and Southeast, African ancestry was the second most prevalent. At an intrapopulation level, all urban populations were highly admixed, and most of the variation in ancestry proportions was observed between individuals within each population rather than among population.'[82]\n\nRegion[82] European African Native American North Region 51% 17% 32% Northeast Region 56% 26% 16% Central-West Region 58% 28% 16% Southeast Region 61% 27% 12% South Region 74% 15% 11%\n\nAn autosomal DNA study (2011), with nearly 1000 samples from every major race group (\"whites\", \"pardos\" and \"blacks\", according to their respective proportions) all over the country found out a major European contribution, followed by a significant high African contribution and a very small, yet still important Native American component.[83] \"In all regions studied, the European ancestry was predominant, with proportions ranging from 60.6% in the Central West to 77.7% in the South\". The 2011 autosomal study samples came from blood donors (the lowest classes constitute the great majority of blood donors in Brazil[84]), and also public health institutions personnel and health students.\n\nRegion[83] European African Native American Northern Brazil 68.80% 10.50% 18.50% Northeast Brazil 60.10% 29.30% 8.90% Southeast Brazil 74.20% 17.30% 7.30% Southern Brazil 79.50% 10.30% 9.40%\n\n\"An autosomal DNA study from 2009 found a similar profile \"all the Brazilian samples (regions) lie more closely to the European group than to the African populations or to the Mestizos from Mexico.\"[85]\n\nRegion[86] European African Native American North Region 60.6% 21.3% 18.1% Northeast Region 66.7% 23.3% 10.0% Central-West Region 66.3% 21.7% 12.0% Southeast Region 60.7% 32.0% 7.3% South Region 81.5% 9.3% 9.2%\n\nAccording to another autosomal DNA study from 2008, by the University of Brasília (UnB), European ancestry dominates in the whole of Brazil (in all regions), accounting for 65.90% of heritage of the population, followed by the African contribution (24.80%) and the Native American (9.3%).[87]\n\nSão Paulo state, the most populous state in Brazil, with about 40 million people, showed the following composition, according to an autosomal study from 2006: European genes account for 79% of the heritage of the people of São Paulo, 14% are of African origin, and 7% Native American.[88] A more recent study, from 2013, found the following composition in São Paulo state: 61.9% European, 25.5% African and 11.6% Native American.[82]\n\nSeveral other studies have suggested that European ancestry is the main component in all Brazilian regions.

[PubMed]), saying that: \"Salzano (28, a study from 1997) calculated for the Northeastern population as a whole, 51% European, 36% African, and 13% Amerindian ancestries whereas in the north, Santos and Guerreiro (29, a study from 1995) obtained 47% European, 12% African, and 41% Amerindian descent, and in the southernmost state of Rio Grande do Sul, Dornelles et al. (30, a study from 1999) calculated 82% European, 7% African, and 11% Amerindian ancestries.[89]\n\nMtDna and y DNA studies\n\n[edit]\n\nAccording to a genetic study about Brazilians, on the paternal side, 98% of the White Brazilian Y Chromosome comes from a European male ancestor, only 2% from an African ancestor and there is a complete absence of Amerindian contributions. On the maternal side, 39% have a European Mitochondrial DNA, 33% Amerindian and 28% African MtDNA.[90] This analysis only shows a small fraction of a person's ancestry (the Y Chromosome comes from a single male ancestor and the mtDNA from a single female ancestor, while the contributions of the many other ancestors is not specified).,[91] but it shows that genetic mixing in Brazil was directional, between Portuguese males and African and Amerindian females.\n\nAnalyzing Black Brazilians' Y chromosome, which comes from male ancestors through paternal line, it was concluded that half (50%) of the Black Brazilian population has at least one male ancestor who came from Europe, 48% has at least one male ancestor who came from Africa and 1.6% has at least one male ancestor who was Native American. Analyzing their mitochondrial DNA, that comes from female ancestors though maternal line, 85% of them have at least a female ancestor who came from Africa, 12.5% have at least a female ancestor who was Native Brazilian and only 2.5% have at least a female ancestor who came from Europe.[92][93]\n\nEuropean and Middle Eastern lineages contributions to Y-haplogroup in the Brazilian population:[94]\n\nRegion Central-West Northern Northeastern Southeastern Southern Portugal 45% 36% 18% 42% 63% France 17% 52% 14% - 0% Italy - 1% 61% 27% 14% Germany 16% - 7% 19% 17% Lebanon 23% 12% - 13% 4%\n\nEuropean and Middle eastern lineages contributions to R1b1a-M269 sub-haplogroups in Brazilian population[94]\n\nRegion Central-West Northern Northeastern Southeastern Southern Portugal 47% 34% 20% 37% 12% Spain 11% 35% 52% 27% 46% France 21% 16% - 20% - Italy 3% 6% 8% 5% 10% Netherlands 11% 7% 3% 9% 7% Germany - 2% 11% 2% 21% Lebanon/Turkey 7% - 6% - 3%\n\nDescendants of colonial-era population\n\n[edit]\n\nSérgio Pena, a leading Brazilian geneticist, summed it up this way:\n\nThe correlation between color and genomic ancestry is imperfect: at the individual level one cannot safely predict the skin color of a person from his/her level of European, African and Amerindian ancestry nor the opposite. Regardless of their skin color, the overwhelming majority of Brazilians have a high degree of European ancestry. Also, regardless of their skin color, the overwhelming majority of Brazilians have a significant degree of African ancestry. Finally, most Brazilians have a significant and very uniform degree of Amerindian ancestry! The high ancestral variability observed in Whites and Blacks suggests that each Brazilian has a singular and quite individual proportion of European, African and Amerindian ancestry in his/her mosaic genomes.[95]\n\nBrazil's racial base are its colonial-era population, consisting of Amerindians, Portuguese settlers, and African slaves:\n\nAt least 50% of the Brazilian paternal ancestry would be of Portuguese origin.[91]\n\nEuropean ancestry predominates in the Brazilian population as a whole, in all regions of Brazil, according to the vast majority of all autosomal studies undertaken covering the entire population, accounting for between 65% and 77% of the ancestry of the population.[96][97][98][99][100][101][102]\n\nAfrican ancestry is high in all regions of Brazil. 86% of Brazilians would have over 10% of their genes coming from Africans, according to a study based on about 200 samples from 2003.[103] The researchers however were cautious about its conclusions: \"Obviously these estimates were made by extrapolation of experimental results with relatively small samples and, therefore, their confidence limits are very ample\". A new autosomal study from 2011, also led by Sérgio Pena, but with nearly 1000 samples this time, from all over the country, shows that in most Brazilian regions most Brazilians \"whites\" are less than 10% African in ancestry, and it also shows that the \"pardos\" are predominantly European in ancestry, the European ancestry being therefore the main component in the Brazilian population, in spite of a very high degree of African ancestry and significant Native American contribution.[100] The African contribution was found to be thus distributed according to the 2011 autosomal study: 10.50% in the North region of Brazil, 29.30% in the Northeast of Brazil, 17.30% in the Southeast of Brazil and 10.30% in the South of Brazil.[100] According to an autosomal study from 2008, African contribution accounts for 25% of the heritage of the population,[99] and according to an autosomal study from 2010, it accounts for 14.30% of the ancestry of the population.[96]\n\nNative American ancestry is significant and present in all regions of Brazil.[96][97][98][99][100][101][102][104]\n\nDescendants of immigrants\n\n[edit]\n\nThe largest influx of European immigrants to Brazil occurred in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. According to the Memorial do Imigrante statistics data, Brazil attracted nearly 5 million immigrants between 1870 and 1953.[105][106] These immigrants were divided in two groups: a part of them was sent to Southern Brazil to work as small farmers. However, the biggest part of the immigrants was sent to Southeast Brazil to work in the coffee plantations. The immigrants sent to Southern Brazil were mainly Germans (starting in 1824, mainly from Rhineland-Palatinate, the others from Pomerania, Hamburg, Westphalia, etc.) and Italians (starting in 1875, mainly from the Veneto and Lombardia). In Southeastern Brazil, most of the immigrants were Italians (mainly from the Veneto, Campania, Calabria and Lombardia), Portuguese (mainly from Beira Alta, Minho and Alto Trás-os-Montes), Spaniards (mainly from Galicia and Andalusia) and smaller numbers of French (most came from the southern regions) and Dutch (from the Netherlands and Belgium).[107]\n\nNotably, the first half of the 20th century saw a large inflow of Japanese (mainly from Honshū, Hokkaidō and Okinawa) and Arabic-speaking Levantine Christians (from modern day Lebanon and Syria) immigrants.\n\nTotal of entries of immigrants in the Port of Santos, São Paulo (1908–1936) – Gender.[108] Nationalities Total % Male % Female Portuguese 275,257 67.9 32.1 Spaniards 209,282 59.4 40.6 Italians 202,749 64.7 35.3 Japanese 176,775 56.2 43.8 Germans 43,989 64.3 35.7 \"Turks\" 26,321 73.4 26.6 Romanians 23,756 53.2 46.7 Yugoslavians 21,209 52.1 47.9 Lithuanians 20,918 58.6 41.4 Syrians 17,275 65.4 34.6 Poles 15,220 61.9 38.1 Austrians 15,041 72.7 27.3 Others 47,664 64.9 35.1 Total 1,221,282 63.8 36.2\n\nEthnicities by region\n\n[edit]\n\nHistorically, the different regions of Brazil had their own migratory movements, which resulted in racial differences between these areas. The Southern region had a greater impact of the European immigration and has a large White majority, which contrasts with the Northern and Northeastern regions, which have a large Pardo (mixed-race) majority. In all regions of Brazil, European ancestry predominates in the population, followed by African and Amerindian ancestries. In Northern Brazil, native Amerindian ancestry is more significant than the African one, while in the Northeastern, Central-Western and Southeastern regions African ancestry is more important than the indigenous one.[109][110]\n\nThe Census of 2007 revealed that the self-reported White population had its higher proportion in the state of Santa Catarina (86.6%) and the lowest in Bahia (20.9%). The Multiracial (Mixed) proportion was higher in Amazonas (72.4%) and lower in Santa Catarina (9.4%). The Black proportion varied from 17% in Bahia to 2.4% in Amazonas. Because of their small number, the Amerindian and Asian population were counted together and they had a higher proportion in Mato Grosso and Roraima (2.3%) and a lower proportion in Paraíba (0.1%).[111]\n\nDistribution by color or race by federative unit UF White Black Multiracial (Mixed) Yellow (Asian) Indigenous No answer AC 23.3 5.7 66.9 2 2.1 0 AL 31 6.6 60.8 1.1 0.4 0 AP 23.8 8.4 65.7 1.1 1.1 0 AM 21.2 4.1 69 0.9 4.8 0 BA 22 17 59.5 1.2 0.4 0 CE 31.6 4.6 62.3 1.2 0.2 0 DF 41.8 7.6 48.6 1.7 0.3 0 ES 42.1 8.3 48.7 0.6 0.3 0 GO 41.4 6.5 50.3 1.7 0.1 0 MA 21.9 9.6 66.9 1.1 0.5 0 MT 37.2 7.4 52.8 1.2 1.4 0 MS 46.8 4.9 44.1 1.2 2.9 0 MG 45.1 9.2 44.6 1 0.2 0 PA 21.6 7 69.9 0.9 0.5 0 PB 39.7 5.6 52.9 1.2 0.5 0 PR 70.1 3.1 25.4 1.2 0.2 0 PE 36.5 6.4 55.5 1 0.6 0 PI 24.2 9.3 64.3 2.1 0.1 - RJ 47.4 12.1 39.6 0.8 0.1 0 RN 40.8 5.2 52.8 1.1 0.1 0 RS 83.2 5.5 10.6 0.3 0.3 0 RO 35 6.8 55.8 1.4 0.9 0.1 RR 20.9 6 60.9 1 11.2 - SC 83.9 2.9 12.6 0.4 0.3 0 SP 63.7 5.4 29.4 1.4 0.1 0 SE 27.7 8.9 61.8 1.3 0.3 0 TO 24.5 9.1 63.6 2 0.9 0\n\nDistribution by color or race by region Região White Black Multiracial (Mixed) Yellow (Asian) Indigenous No answer Brazil 47.5 7.5 43.4 1.1 0.4 0 Center-West 41.5 6.6 49.4 1.5 0.9 0 North 23.2 6.5 67.2 1.1 1.9 0 Northeast 29.2 9.4 59.8 1.2 0.4 0 Southeast 54.9 7.8 36 1.1 0.1 0 South 78.3 4 16.7 0.7 0.3 0\n\nSouth\n\n[edit]\n\nThe South of Brazil is the region with the largest percentage of Europeans. According to the 2005 census, people of European ancestry account for 79.6% of the population.[112] In colonial times, this region had a very small population.\n\nThe region what is now Southern Brazil was originally settled by Amerindian peoples, mostly Guarani and Kaingangs.[113] Only a few settlers from São Paulo were living there. This situation made the region vulnerable to attacks from neighboring countries. This fact forced the King of Portugal to decide to populate the region. For this, settlers from the Portuguese Azores islands were sent to the coast in 1617.[114]\n\nTo stimulate the immigration to Brazil, the king offered several benefits for the Azorean couples. Between 1748 and 1756, six thousand Portuguese from the Azores moved to the coast of Santa Catarina. They were mainly newly married who were seeking a better life. At that time, the Azores were one of the poorest regions of Portugal. They established themselves mainly in the Santa Catarina Island, nowadays the region of Florianópolis. Later, some couples moved to Rio Grande do Sul, where they established Porto Alegre, the capital. The Azoreans lived on fishing and agriculture, especially flour. They composed over half of Rio Grande do Sul and Santa Catarina's population in the late 18th century.[115] The state of Paraná was settled by colonists from São Paulo due to their proximity (Paraná was part of São Paulo until the mid-19th century).\n\nWith the development of cattle in the interior of Rio Grande do Sul, African slaves began arriving in large numbers. By 1822, Africans were 50% of Rio Grande do Sul's population. This number decreased to 25% in 1858 and to only 5.2% in 2005. Most of them came from Angola.[116]\n\nAfter independence from Portugal (1822) the Brazilian government started to stimulate the arrival of a new wave of immigrants to settle the South. In 1824 they established São Leopoldo, a German community. Major Schaeffer, a German who was living in Brazil, was sent to Germany in order to bring immigrants. From Rhineland-Palatinate, the Major brought the immigrants and soldiers. Settlers from Germany were brought to work as small farmers, because there were many land holdings without workers.[117]\n\nTo attract the immigrants, the Brazilian government had promised large tracts of land, where they could settle with their families and colonize the region. The first years were not easy. Many Germans died of tropical disease, while others left the colonies to find better living conditions. The German colony of São Leopoldo was a disaster. Nevertheless, in the following years, a further 4,830 Germans arrived at São Leopoldo, and then the colony started to develop, with the immigrants establishing the town of Novo Hamburgo (New Hamburg).[118]\n\nFrom São Leopoldo and Novo Hamburgo, the German immigrants spread into others areas of Rio Grande do Sul, mainly close to sources of rivers. The whole region of Vale dos Sinos was populated by Germans. During the 1830s and part of the 1840s German immigration to Brazil was interrupted due to conflicts in the country (Ragamuffin War). The immigration restarted after 1845 with the creation of new colonies. The most important ones were Blumenau, in 1850, and Joinville in 1851, both in Santa Catarina state; these attracted thousands of German immigrants to the region. In the next five decades, other 28 thousand Germans were brought to Rio Grande do Sul to work as small farmers in the countryside.[119] By 1914, it is estimated that 50 thousand Germans settled in this state.\n\nAnother immigration boom to this region started in 1875. Communities with Italian immigrants were also created in southern Brazil. The first colonies to be populated by Italians were created in the highlands of Rio Grande do Sul (Serra Gaúcha). These were Garibaldi and Bento Gonçalves. These immigrants were predominantly from Veneto, in northern Italy. After five years, in 1880, the great numbers of Italian immigrants arriving caused the Brazilian government to create another Italian colony, Caxias do Sul. After initially settling in the government-promoted colonies, many of the Italian immigrants spread themselves into other areas of Rio Grande do Sul seeking further opportunities.[120]\n\nThey created many other Italian colonies on their own, mainly in highlands, because the lowlands were already populated by Germans and native gaúchos. The Italian established many vineyards in the region. Nowadays, the wine produced in these areas of Italian colonization in southern Brazil is much appreciated within the country, though little is available for export. In 1875, the first Italian colonies were established in Santa Catarina, which lies immediately to the north of Rio Grande do Sul. The colonies gave rise to towns such as Criciúma, and later also spread further north, to Paraná.\n\nA significant number of Poles have settled in Southern Brazil. The first immigrants arrived in 1869 and until 1959, it is estimated that over 100,000 Poles migrated to Brazil,[121] 95% of whom were peasants. The State of Paraná received the majority of Polish immigrants, who settled mainly in the region of Curitiba, in the towns of Mallet, Cruz Machado, São Matheus do Sul, Irati, and União da Vitória.[122]\n\nSoutheast\n\n[edit]\n\nThe Southeastern region of Brazil is the most ethnically diverse part of the country. Europeans make up 55.16% of its population, those of mixed-race 35.69%, and African descent 7.91%. It has the largest percentage of Asian Brazilians, composing 0.8%, and a small Amerindian community (0.2%).\n\nSoutheast Brazil is home to the oldest Portuguese village in the Americas, São Vicente, São Paulo, established in 1532.[123] The region, since the beginning of its colonization, is a melting pot of Africans, Natives, and Europeans. The Indigenous peoples of the region were enslaved by the Portuguese. The race mixing between the indigenous females and their European masters produced the Bandeirante, the colonial inhabitant of São Paulo, who formed expeditions that crossed the interior of Brazil and greatly increased the Portuguese colonial territory. The main language spoken by these people of mixed Indian/Portuguese heritage was Língua geral, a language that mixed Tupi and Portuguese words.\n\nIn the late 17th century the Bandeirantes found gold in the area that nowadays is Minas Gerais. A gold rush took place in Brazil and thousands of Portuguese colonists arrived during this period. The confrontation between the Bandeirantes and the Portuguese for obtaining possession of the mines led to the Emboabas' War. The Portuguese won the war. The Amerindian culture declined, giving space to a stronger Portuguese cultural domination. In order to control the wealth, the Portuguese Crown moved the capital of Brazil from Salvador, Bahia to Rio de Janeiro. Thousands of African slaves were brought to work in the gold mines. They were landed in Rio de Janeiro and sent to other regions. By the late 18th century, Rio de Janeiro was an \"African city\": most of its inhabitants were slaves. No other place in the world had as many slaves since the end of the Roman Empire.[124] In 1808 the Portuguese Royal Family, fleeing from Napoleon, took charge in Rio de Janeiro. Some 15,000 Portuguese nobles moved to Brazil. The region changed a lot, becoming more European.\n\nAfter independence and principally after 1850, Southeast Brazil was \"inundated\" by European immigrants, who were attracted by the government to replace the African slaves in the coffee plantations. Most immigrants landed in the Port of Santos and have been forwarded to the coffee farms within São Paulo. The vast majority of the immigrants came from Italy. Brazil attracted nearly 5 million immigrants between 1870 and 1953. The large number of Italians are visible in many parts of Southeast Brazil. Their descendants are nowadays predominant in many areas. For example, Northeast São Paulo is 45% Italian.[125]\n\nThe arrival of immigrants from several parts of Europe, the Middle-East and Asia produced an ethnically diverse population. The city of Bastos, in São Paulo, is 11.4% Japanese. The city of São Paulo is home to the largest Japanese population outside Japan itself. [126]\n\nNortheast\n\n[edit]\n\nThe population of Northeast Brazil is a result of an intensive race mixing, which has occurred in the region for more than four centuries. According to the 2006 census people reported as \"Pardo\" (Multiracial) make up 62.5% of the population. Those reported as African account for 7.8%.\n\nThis region did not have much effect from the massive European immigration that took place in Southern Brazil in the late 19th century and first decades of the 20th century. The Northeast has been a poorer region of Brazil since the decline of sugar cane plantations in the late 17th century, so its economy did not require immigrants.\n\nThe ethnic composition of the population starts in the 16th century. The Portuguese settlers rarely brought women, which led to relationships with the Indian women. Later, interracial relationships occurred between Portuguese males and African females. The coast, in the past the place where millions of African slaves arrived (mostly from modern-day Angola, Ghana, Nigeria and Benin) to work in sugar-cane plantations, is where nowadays there is a predominance of Mulattoes, those of African and European ancestry. Salvador, Bahia is considered the most African city in Brazil, with almost 80% of its inhabitants being African-Brazilians or Pardos. In the interior, there is a predominance of Indian and European mixture.[127]\n\nNorth\n\n[edit]\n\nNorthern Brazil, largely covered by the Amazon rainforest, is the Brazilian region with the largest Amerindian influences, both in culture and ethnicity. Inhabited by diverse indigenous tribes, this part of Brazil was reached by Portuguese and Spanish colonists in the 17th century, but it started to be populated by non-Indians only in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. The exploitation of rubber used in the growing industries of automobiles, has emerged a huge migration to the region.\n\nMany people from the poor Northeast Brazil, mostly Ceará, moved to the Amazon area. The contact between the Indians and the northeastern rubbers created the base of the ethnic composition of the region, with its mixed-race majority.\n\nCentral-West\n\n[edit]\n\nThe Central-West region of Brazil was inhabited by diverse Indians when the Portuguese arrived in the early 18th century. The Portuguese came to explore the precious stones that were found there. Contact between the Portuguese and the Indians created a mixed-race population. Until the mid-20th century, Central-West Brazil had a very small population. The situation changed with the construction of Brasília, the new capital of Brazil, in 1960. Many workers were attracted to the region, mostly from northeastern Brazil.\n\nA new wave of settlers started arriving from the 1970s. With the mechanization of agriculture in the South of Brazil, many rural workers of German and Italian origin migrated to Central-West Brazil. In some areas, they are already the majority of the population.\n\nDays celebrating racial groups in Brazil\n\n[edit]\n\nIn Brazil, the \"Day of the Caboclo\" (Dia do Caboclo) is observed annually on June 24, in celebration of the contributions and identity of the original caboclos and their descendants. This date is an official public holiday in the State of Amazonas.\n\n\"Mixed Race Day\" (Dia do Mestiço) is observed annually on June 27, three days after the Day of the Caboclo, in celebration of all mixed-race Brazilians, including the caboclos. The date is an official public holiday in three Brazilian states.\n\n\"Indigenous Peoples Day\" (Dia dos Povos Indígenas), observed annually on April 19, recognizes and honours the indigenous peoples of Brazil.\n\n\"Black Awareness Day\" (Dia da Consciência Negra) is observed annually on November 20 as a day \"to celebrate a regained awareness by the black community about their great worth and contribution to the country\". The date is an official public holiday in five Brazilian states.\n\nSee also\n\n[edit]\n\nDemographics of Brazil\n\nRacism in Brazil\n\nSocial apartheid in Brazil\n\nRacial whitening\n\nRacial democracy\n\nPost-abolition in Brazil"
