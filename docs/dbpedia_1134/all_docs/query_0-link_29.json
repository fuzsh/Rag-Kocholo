Almost the entire national territory is located between the Equator and the Tropic of Capricorn, and the Earth axial tilt to the south certainly makes Brazil one of the countries of the world with greater extent of land in proximity to the sun. The Brazilian coastline, where most of its population lives, is more than 8,500 km long. Due to geographic characteristics and cultural trends, Brazilians are among the peoples with the highest annual exposure to the sun. Epidemiological data show a continuing increase in the incidence of non-melanoma and melanoma skin cancers. Photoprotection can be understood as a set of measures aimed at reducing sun exposure and at preventing the development of acute and chronic actinic damage. Due to the peculiarities of Brazilian territory and culture, it would not be advisable to replicate the concepts of photoprotection from other developed countries, places with completely different climates and populations. Thus the Brazilian Society of Dermatology has developed the Brazilian Consensus on Photoprotection, the first official document on photoprotection developed in Brazil for Brazilians, with recommendations on matters involving photoprotection.\n\nKeywords: Dermatology, Protection, Solar radiation, Sun protection factor\n\nCHAPTER I\n\nELECTROMAGNETIC SPECTRUM AND SOLAR RADIATION INTRODUCTION AND CONCEPTS\n\nElectromagnetic radiations are classified according to the length or frequency of wave propagation. For example, radio waves, microwaves, infrared, visible light, ultraviolet, X rays and gamma rays are names of radiation bands, ordered from the longer to the shorter wavelength. They can also be ordered from the smaller to the larger frequency, since wavelength and frequency are inversely proportional.\n\nInfrared, visible light and ultraviolet radiations comprise almost the total radiation emanating from the sun. According to the International Radiation Commission (CIE, from the French Comission Internacional de l'Eclairage), this set of radiations is called optical radiation.1 Only a fraction, less than 1% of solar radiation, does not consist of optical radiation and, therefore, aggregates other bands like microwaves, X rays or gamma rays. Generally, the solar radiation reaching the top of terrestrial atmosphere is basically composed of:\n\n■ Ultraviolet radiation (UVR), characterized by wavelength radiations between 100 and 400 nm**, represents about 10% of total solar radiation reaching the top of the atmosphere, but suffers intensive attenuation until it reaches the surface. UVR is accountable for a series of important photochemical and photobiological reactions;\n\n■ Visible radiation, comprised of wavelengths between 400 and 780 nm, represents 40% of the radiation emanating from the sun and is defined as any radiation able to cause a visual sensation. Compared to other wavelengths, visible radiation undergoes less attenuation when going through the atmosphere of the Earth;\n\n■ Infrared radiation, a wide band with wavelengths longer than 780 nm, represents the remaining 50% of solar radiation. Infrared radiation is strongly absorbed by water vapor and carbon gas present in significant amounts in the atmosphere, being therefore intimately connected with climate changes in the planet.\n\n■ **nm = nanometer. A nanometer is equivalent to one billionth of a meter, that is, 1 nm = 10-9. Another widely used submultiple is one millionth of the meter, called micrometer (µ m = 10-6 m = 1000nm)\n\nIt is important to note that these percentages concerning quantities of each radiation band show small variations related to cycles and disturbances of solar activity. In addition, there are no precise limits for the spectral band of visible radiation, since these limits depend on the quantity of radiant energy reaching the retina and the sensitivity of the observer. The lower limit is usually between 360 and 400 nm, while the upper limit is between 760 and 830 nm.\n\nIn the specific case of UVR, the terms UVA, UVB and UVC were introduced in 1930 by Committee 41 of CIE because of the different photobiologic effects of these spectral bands.2 Therefore, the UVR was divided into:\n\n■ UV-C, between 100 and 280 nm;\n\n■ UV-B, between 280 and 315 nm; and\n\n■ UV-A, between 315 and 400 nm.\n\nThe same limits and designations of these spectral bands are also adopted by the International Organization for Standardization (ISO, 2007). CIE highlights the importance of international standardization, since such bands are widely used in different medical and scientific research fields and, although some investigators use the 320 nm limit for the division of UVA and UVB bands, the norm adopted in 1930 is still the one recommended.\n\nAnother very common division found in literature concerns the UVA band, which is divided into two parts: UVA1 (315-340 nm) and UVA2 (340-400 nm). This division is based on recent research that shows different types of photobiologic interaction between such bands and the DNA. Although this division may have some practical value, neither CIE nor ISO recommend the division of UVA radiation into these two sub-bands.2,3\n\nBesides the fact that it is the smallest part of solar radiation that reaches the top of the atmosphere, UVR is strongly attenuated by the terrestrial atmosphere and reaches the surface in quantities that are small, but sufficient to provide significant photobiologic effect. UVC is completely absorbed by the oxygen and ozone present in the stratosphere, while UVB radiation undergoes strong absorption by ozone and is intensively scattered by molecules.\n\nTherefore, superficial UVR is mostly composed of UVA radiation that, while also being actively spread by the molecules present in the atmosphere, undergoes smaller ozone absorption. In addition to these, several other environmental factors also interact with UVR, as shown below.\n\nENVIRONMENTAL FACTORS THAT INFLUENCE ULTRAVIOLET RADIATION\n\nIt is important to emphasize that the superficial UVR levels depend on a group of meteorological, geographic and temporal factors. Therefore, we cannot evaluate the influence of each of these environmental factors separately, but only as a group of elements that may depend on and influence each other.\n\nOzone\n\nOzone, the main absorber of UVR, is produced for the most part in the terrestrial stratosphere of the equatorial region of the planet. However, due to the transportation mechanisms existing in the high atmosphere, a great part of the produced ozone is transported to higher latitudes. Therefore, the equatorial region of the planet has smaller quantities of ozone than higher latitude regions and the poles.\n\nOzone layer is the name given to the region with high concentration of this gas in the Earth's atmosphere, located at a height between 15 and 30 km. This layer contains between 80 and 90% of the total ozone in the terrestrial atmosphere and is responsible for the intensive absorption of UVB radiation and part of the extinction of UVC radiation. The rest of the ozone is mostly found in regions close to the terrestrial surface.\n\nDuring the 1980 decade, scientists observed that the ozone layer was strongly diminished in high latitude regions, especially in the poles. It was found that this drastic reduction, that may reduce by 80 to 90% the total concentration of the gas in the atmosphere, is mainly produced by the free chlorine released by chlorofluorocarbons (CFC), gases created by man and intensively used as manufacturing propellents and refrigerating fluids in the entire planet.\n\nThe presence of chlorine (or bromine) in great quantities in the atmosphere unbalances the ozone formation and destruction chain, accelerating its destruction process. With less ozone, there is less absorption of UVR and, therefore, increased presence of superficial radiation. Comparisons of ozone contents measured between 1964-1980 and 2002-2005 show an average decrease of 3.5% in the ozone content of the Earth's atmosphere, more intensively in high latitudes and less representative in the tropics.4\n\nWith the objective of slowing down this process of ozone destruction, in 1987 the Montreal Protocol (http://www.protocolodemontreal.org.br/) was established to forbid the production and consumption of CFCs and other gases that destroy the ozone layer. Adhesion of the nations to the Protocol was massive and the elimination of CFC consumption has allowed a recovery of ozone levels in the entire planet. It is foreseen that by the middle of this century the ozone layer will be completely recovered to levels existing prior to production of CFCs.5 A study by UK Chemistry and Aerosols shows that the Montreal Protocol will prevent the onset of two million new skin cancer cases until the year 2030.6\n\nAltitude\n\nThe higher the altitude of a location, the thinner is the atmosphere above it and, consequently, the larger the quantity of UVR reaching the surface. In situations of clear and cloudless skies, the UVR flux may increase between 5 and 10% for each 1000 m altitude. Nevertheless, this altitude-related increase in URV may vary to values close to 20% per kilometer, as it depends on a series of other factors, such as the quantity of ozone in the lower layers of the atmosphere, the type of surface that reflects UV radiation, the particulates present in the atmosphere and even the position of the sun.7\n\nThe time of day and the season of the year\n\nIn a clear sky situation, the \"higher\" the Sun is in the sky, the higher the levels of UV radiation are. This means that the farther the Sun is from the horizon, the shorter the optical pathway the radiation has to cross in the atmosphere. Under these conditions, UVR undergoes less interaction with gases and particulates and, consequently, is less attenuated. Therefore, at times close to solar noon, UVR reaches its highest daytime values.\n\nThe same reasoning may be used to evaluate the variation of UVR fluxes in relation to the season of the year. In the summer, the Sun reaches higher positions in relation to the horizon than in the winter and, consequently, the UVR flux is more intense. The differences between the seasons of the year become more relevant as the latitude becomes higher. That is, in the tropics there is little difference between the position of the Sun in the summer and in the winter, while in higher latitudes this difference is quite significant.\n\nClouds\n\nThe UVR levels in clear sky days, that is, when there are no clouds, are usually higher. However, the presence of clouds tends to attenuate UVR and diminish the quantity of surface radiation. Nevertheless, the attenuance levels may vary considerably and the clouds do not always exert adequate protection against UVR. Deep and dark clouds, as seen in rainstorms, may almost totally attenuate UVR fluxes, but thinner and lighter clouds can attenuate them only partially.\n\nDue to this great variability, it is not possible to provide a parameter or an UVR attenuation percentage for nebulosity. There are even particular situations when the presence of cumulus or cirrus clouds may trigger a UVR intensification phenomenon and, for a short period of time, make UVR fluxes superior to those that would be observed on a clear sky day.\n\nAerosols\n\nSolid or liquid particles found in the atmosphere are called aerosols. Soot emitted by automobiles, motorcycles and trucks or burning biomass, suspended soil dust or even sea salt from evaporated ocean water are examples of atmospheric aerosols. These particles interact with UVR, most often reflecting the radiation to other directions. However, some types of aerosols are also able to absorb part of the incident UVR.\n\nThus, polluted environments or those with suspended dust may show UVR attenuation in relation to clear sky situations. Some studies demonstrate that polluted locations, such as São Paulo(SP)8 or Mexico City,9 may present situations with around 20% of the incident UVR. Nevertheless, such decrease of UVR is observed in periods of intense pollution and aerosols should not be considered as protective agents concerning sun exposure.\n\nSurface reflection (albedo)\n\nThe term 'albedo' is used to express the relationship between the radiation reflected by a surface and the radiation such surface receives from the Sun. Therefore, UVR is reflected in different ways, depending on the surface it incides on. This is the reason why albedo may be a determining factor in the evaluation of the quantity of radiation reaching an individual. Very light colored surfaces, such as freshly fallen snow, may reflect up to 90% of the incident radiation; therefore, wearing adequate protection for the eyes and skin is required in environments like mountains and ski tracks.\n\nAs regards the environments typically observed in Brazil, the urban and blacktop paved areas generally present 3 to 5% albedo. Sand has albedo variable between 2 and 12%, depending on sand type and humidity. Grassy surfaces present low albedo, around 1 to 4%, but light colored concrete may reflect between 10 and 20% of the UV radiation.10\n\nULTRAVIOLET INDEX (UVI)\n\nThe ultraviolet index (UVI) is a scale of values recommended by WHO (World Health Organization), related to the intensity of UV radiation that induces the onset of erythema in human skin.11 This scale has the purpose of simplifying information of UVR levels to the lay public according to a table of whole values, where zero is the smallest value while the largest value is usually represented by the symbol 11+. However, it is important to emphasize that there is no upper limit. The higher the value, the greater is the potential of solar damage to skin and eyes.\n\nThe variables that influence the calculation or measurement of UVI are those introduced in the previous subchapter. That is, the total ozone content of the atmosphere is taken into account, as well as the geographic position of the location (the closer it is to the Equator line, the higher the UVI); the altitude of the surface (at high altitudes, higher UVI are observed); the time of day (most of the UVR reaches the surface at times close to solar noon); season of the year (the UVI escalates in the summer and diminishes in the winter); atmospheric conditions (the UVI are generally higher in days of cloudless skies); and type of surface.\n\nThe use of this scale is an important tool to orient the population regarding the risks of excessive solar exposure. It is especially useful for those groups that are more vulnerable to the damaging effects of UVR, like people with low phototypes (I and II), children, the elderly and tourists, people with history of great cumulative solar exposure and/or skin cancer, etc.\n\nThe UVI scale and WHO general recommendations for photoprotection are shown in .\n\nThe category designated \"low UVI\" usually happens at times close to dawn and sunset, in addition to moments when a great mass of dense clouds covers the sky. However, it is always very important to be extremely careful in evaluating UVI when there are clouds, since nebulosity may not significantly attenuate UVR or even intensify radiation levels in short periods of time. It should be remembered that WHO recommends sun protection measures when UVI values are over 3.\n\nULTRAVIOLET RADIATION EMMITED BY LAMPS AND ARTIFICIAL SOURCES\n\nEver since the second half of last century, studies about the UVR emitted by artificial sources have been carried out to clarify the relationship between the use of fluorescent lamps and the incidence of cutaneous melanoma. Such studies reflect the concern about the possibility of increased risk of incidence of skin cancer, melanoma and non melanoma, in individuals exposed to UVR emitted by these lamps.\n\nIn 1988, for example, Swerdlow et al. already pointed to a connection between skin cancer and exposure to indoor tanning methods.12 Nevertheless, a short time before, in 1985, English et al. showed that there is no connection between the incidence of melanomas and exposure to fluorescent lamps regularly used at home and in the office.13 In 1990, Diffey indicated the main situations of UV radiation risk derived from artificial sources: artificial tanning chambers, medical and dental phototherapy, industrial photoprocesses, sterilization and disinfection, laboratory investigation, insect traps and lighting for environments in general.14\n\nThe types of lamps found in the market are halogen quartz lamps, incandescent lamps with a tungsten filament, tube fluorescent and compact fluorescent lamps. In all of the continents, discussions regarding the rational use of energy are increasingly frequent subjects and a priority in government agendas. In this scenario, incandescent lamps with a tungsten filament are being replaced by compact fluorescent lamps due to their low energy consumption, both for domestic and commercial use.15\n\nFew papers have been published related to UVR emission by artificial lighting sources. The quantities of UVA and UVB emitted by commonly used lamps are very small and totally blocked by the protective membrane currently included in the glass casing of lamps. Thus, there are no reports about UVR emission by the lamps found on the market.16,17\n\nAlthough they do not emit UV radiation, the lamps are visible light emitting sources and present variations within the electromagnetic spectrum that may affect individuals with other skin diseases, such as melasma, for example, depending on exposure intensity and frequency.18 At any rate, it is important to emphasize that there is no relationship between exposure to common artificial lamps at home and in the office and skin cancer.\n\nCHARACTERISTICS OF SOLAR RADIATION IN BRAZIL\n\nA significant set of data collected in the last few years in several regions of Brazil allows us to trace the behavior of ultraviolet solar radiation in Brazilian soil more accurately. We will see that these data show a great need to better educate our population regarding the risks of solar exposure without adequate protection.\n\nIn Brazil, there is generous offer of ultraviolet radiation. UVR roughly presents higher values for smaller geographic latitudes, but other factors like altitude, season of the year, time of day and meteorologic characteristics such as presence of clouds and atmospheric pollution also influence the intensity of solar radiation. Despite these variations, UVR levels in clear sky conditions are always very high in every season of the year and in almost the entire Brazilian territory.19\n\nTaking into account geographic position, the North and Northeast regions present the highest cumulative doses of ultraviolet radiation. This means that, in those regions, UVR levels are high and vary little during the entire year. On the other hand, in the South and Southeast regions the effect of the seasons of the year is quite perceptible, so that UVR levels show great variability between winter and summer.20\n\nIt is important to highlight the fact that, in the summer, the Southeast region presents record UVR intensity observed in the country, with levels even higher than in the Northeast region. This occurs due to the geographic position of the Brazilian Southeast region. The city of São Paulo (SP), for example, is at 23º latitude south and this angle coincides with the angle of inclination of the planet in relation to the sun. Therefore, in the summer, the sun reaches its highest point at noon and, consequently, in a clear sky day, UVR levels are more intense.\n\nThe UV radiation distribution here presented considered only the geographic positions of Brazilian regions. However, it is important to take into account also the meteorologic factors, such as the occurrence of rainy seasons, with the presence of deep clouds that significantly attenuate UV radiation. The Central region of Brazil, for example, may receive great incidence of solar radiation during the dry seasons (autumn and winter), as there is less rainfall and an even larger number of clear sky days.\n\nThis daytime UVR variability due to the presence or absence of clouds influences the cumulative radiation dose to which an individual is exposed. According to WHO, the recommended daily dose of UV radiation a person should be exposed to is 108 J/m2. UVR readings collected in São Paulo (SP), Ilhéus (BA) and Itajubá (MG) between 2005 and 2009, demonstrated that the daily means of UV radiation are similar, around 3300 and 3800 J/m2, with smaller variation in value amplitude in the Northeast when compared to the Southeast region. In the summer, the daily means are still larger and may reach values over 7000 J/m2. It is a reason for concern to observe that, even in the winter, a person exposed without protection in the period between 8:00 a.m. and 5:00 p.m., may receive a UVR dose higher than recommended. This is a reality for many Brazilian workers.20\n\nIn our country, the cultural trend of solar exposure on beaches is still very popular. Most of the tourists visit Brazilian beaches in the period of greater incidence of UVR, being subject to large UVR quantities and their related hazards. An experiment carried out at the Ponta Negra beach, in Natal (RN), is a clear example of the high UV radiation levels to which an individual may be exposed. In readings taken in the morning, the cumulative dose registered between 9:40 a.m. and noon was 5250 J/m2, that is, over 50 times the maximum daily dose recommended by WHO and almost 12 times the necessary dose to trigger erythema in an individual of phototype IV.20 However, it is important to point out that this kind of dose is not observed only at seaside resorts, but also in urban centers.\n\nAwareness of this UVR incidence pattern, as well as the cumulative daily dose Brazilians are apt to receive, are fundamental tools to define skin care policies.\n\nIn Brazil, the UVI observed in cloudless days and at solar noon is frequently found at extreme levels during the summer in all of the country. In winter, the North and Northeast regions may present UVI at these same extreme levels, while in the South and Southeast mean UVI levels may be observed.19,21-23 shows the distribution of maximum UVI in the country on a day in August 2013. Daily UVI data are available at the site of the Center for Weather Forecast and Climatic Studies of the National Institute for Space Research.24\n\npresents mean ultraviolet index values for clear sky conditions (without clouds) on solstice and equinox days, in four Brazilian locations.25\n\nIt is important to point out some elements in . In the summer (solid line), UVI values on clear sky days reach extreme values in all of the regions in the country. In the spring and fall such values may also be reached, mainly in the North and Northeast regions, and even in the Southeast region. Even when such figures present particular situations of cloudless and clear sky, these values are commonly observed and recorded in the literature. In addition, times usually recommended for sun exposure (before 10:00 a.m. and after 4:00 p.m.) may also present high and very high UVI values and, consequently, cause damage to the skin and eyes.\n\nExcessive sun exposure and ignorance of these data by the greater part of the population have been considered the main factors in the increasing incidence of skin cancer.26 Encouraging the population to take the necessary precautions based on conscious sun exposure may reduce the undesirable consequences of this practice.\n\nRECOMMENDATIONS OF THE BRAZILIAN CONSENSUS ON PHOTOPROTECTION\n\nResearch on solar radiation characteristics in Brazil should be encouraged to better understand the sun exposure peculiarities faced by Brazilians, producing public photoprotection policies adapted to our reality.\n\nThe Ultraviolet Index should be better divulged to the Brazilian population, by means of printed and electronic communication media, as a form of orientation regarding daily photoprotection, suggesting the use of photoprotective measures that meet the specific conditions of that location and on that specific day.\n\nThe dermatologists and the scientific community should be aware of the solar radiation peculiarities in Brazil, avoiding the automatic incorporation of concepts originated in countries that have climates distinct from ours.\n\nSBD (Sociedade Brasileira de Dermatologia) agrees that the use of tanning chambers for esthetic purposes should be forbidden in Brazil.\n\nHowever, the use of artificial radiation for the treatment of some skin diseases should be permitted, under the guidance of the dermatologist in charge.\n\nCHAPTER 2\n\nEFFECTS OF SOLAR RADIATION ON THE SKIN (ULTRAVIOLET RADIATION, VISIBLE LIGHT AND INFRARED RADIATION)\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nThe reactions caused by sunlight on the skin are many and may be both positive and negative. They depend, among other factors, on radiation intensity and wavelength, as well as on the type of skin of each individual. Moreover, it is a known fact that the dose of energy depends on the time of exposure, the proximity to the sun and radiation wavelength (the longer it is, the greater the penetration of light in the skin).\n\nThe effects of ultraviolet radiation (UVR) on the skin may be considered immediate (acute) and delayed (chronic). The immediate ones are erythema, increased skin temperature, skin thickening, immediate pigmentation, persistent pigmentation, delayed tanning and vitamin D production,27,28 while the delayed ones are photoaging and skin cancer.29-31 In addition, visible light (VL, 400-780 nm) and infrared radiation (IR, 780 - 1 mm) also exert both acute and chronic effects over the skin, which have also been intensively studied.32\n\nFACTORS THAT INFLUENCE ULTRAVIOLET RADIATION EFFECTS ON THE SKIN\n\nThe classification proposed by Fitzpatrick for skin types ( ) is a numerical scheme used to describe skin response to sunlight.33 It meets the purpose of evaluation of erythema and pigmentation formation secondary to UV radiation exposure, but it is not fully adequate for the evaluation of a mixed race population. In this sense, currently different authors report that the classification proposed by Fitzpatrick is not exactly related to the color of the skin in those of non-Caucasian origin, particularly the Hispanic and Asian populations. A study carried out with a small Brazilian population group34 demonstrated that the erythematogenic response of this population differed from Fitzpatrick's classification.\n\nCHART 1\n\nSkin phototypeCutaneous reaction to UVRIAlways burnsNever tansIIAlways burns easilyTans minimallyIIIBurns moderatelyTans moderatelyIVBurns minimallyTans easilyVRarely burnsTans easily and substantiallyVIAlmost never burnsTans promptly and intensely\n\nIn spite of this, this classification is still used, since there is no other that is more apropriate. Phototypes I and II burn more easily than tan. Thus, individuals with these types of skin have an increased incidence of skin cancer when compared to those with higher phototypes, who tan more easily than burn. The reason for this may be explained by the finding that skins that are more melanocompetent have reduced UVR penetration and faster DNA repair rates, when compared to lighter skins.35\n\nAnother important observation is that UVR penetration also varies according to the irradiated part of the body, due to the different thicknesses of the corneal layer, as well as of the entire epidermis, in different body areas. In this sense, there is greater penetration in areas where the epidermis is thinner.27,28,36 Furthermore, other factors are important when the effects of UVR and VL on the skin are evaluated, such as age, gender, degree of hydration, UVR or VL dose (variable according to the time of day), latitude, reflection rate of environmental surface (for example, sand versus snow), temperature and the use of photosensitizing medications.27,37\n\nErythema\n\nIt is an acute reaction, accompanied by edema, local burning sensation and, in more intense cases, onset of vesicles and blisters. The light skinned individuals react more intensively than those who are dark skinned.\n\nThe erythema begins after a latency period of 2 to 7 hours, when the skin is exposed to a single and intense radiation dose, which persists for hours or days. The maximum intensity of erythema occurs in around 12-24 hours, then declines. An increased radiation dose diminishes the threshold period and increases the persistence of the erythematous reaction.27,32\n\nSunburn is an acute inflammatory reaction characterized, at first, by vascular dilation, increased vascular permeability and migration of polymorphonuclear leukocytes. The main factor responsible for this is UVB (280-315 nm), with smaller participation of UVA (315-400 nm). As a result of UVB action, vascular dilation substances are formed, particularly prostaglandins, determining the threshold period, which may be partly delayed by drugs that inhibit prostaglandin synthesis, such as acetylsalicylic acid and indomethacin.\n\nUVA and infrared (IR) radiation exert their action directly over the vessels of the dermis, determining vascular dilation and erythema, without interference of mediators. The erythema appears later and may become gradually more intense. The action of UVR on epidermal cells is over the DNA, where it is absorbed mainly by pyrimidines, with DNA chain break. Later on there is repair by enzymatic mechanisms such as repair by excision, photoreactivation and recombination. Accompanying the immediate erythema caused by intense sun exposure, the body temperature rises and is followed by sudoresis for regulation by IR action. If the radiation is very intense, sunstroke may occur.27,30,32\n\nSunstroke\n\nIt is a group of symptoms that may occur after intense exposure to sunlight, resulting in excessive escalation of body temperature, which could be fatal. Usually the body is cooled by sweat, but in some situations this mechanism is not sufficient. In these cases, the body temperature of an individual may rise rapidly and damage vital organs.\n\nThere are environmental variations that also interfere in the ability of the body to cool itself in high temperature environments, such as, for example, the presence of increased air humidity. In addition, other factors interfere in the body temperature regulation ability, such as age (it is smaller in children and the elderly), obesity, fever and dehydration.\n\nThe main sunstroke symptoms are: abnormally high body temperature, erythematous skin, tachycardia, cephalea, dyspnea, vertigo, nausea, vomit, dehydration, confusion and loss of consciousness.38-40\n\nPigmentation\n\nPigmentation, which should be differentiated from delayed tanning (DT), presents a biphasic response. Immediate pigment darkening (IPD) occurs in minutes of exposure to UVA and VL, and may last up to two hours. IPD is followed by Persistent Pigment Darkening (PPD), with a peak in two hours that may last for 24 hours. DT occurs between three and five days after sun exposure, may persist for several weeks and even for months.27,32\n\nIPD and PPD are derived from the Meirowsky phenomenon, where photo-oxidation of melanin previously formed in the melanosomes takes place, as well as its transference from the melanocytes to the keratinocytes. They depend on UVA and also on VL.27\n\nDifferently from IPD and PPD, DT happens because there is an increase in melanin production by the melanocytes, which have had their number, size and activity increased. DT may disappear in months or years, in accordance with individual characteristics. DT depends on UVB, as well as on UVA and VL.27\n\nThe ability to acquire pigmentation (IPD, PPD and DT) is influenced by genetic factors and is stronger in darker skins.27,32\n\nPhotoimmunosuppression\n\nThe immunosuppression caused by UVR has been more frequently described since 1970, when Kripke demonstrated the absence of tumor rejection by mice previously irradiated with UVR.41\n\nFurthermore, UVR causes suppression of the immune response of the skin to several antigens, like microorganisms, protein complexes or even haptens. Information on UVR action over immune response is obtained mainly by means of studies with animals.\n\nImmunosuppression caused by UVR may affect the skin, internal organs, lymphatic and blood tissues. The immune function may be diminished, depending on UVR wavelength, on UVB, UVA2 (315 - 340 nm) and UVA1(340 - 400 nm), energy dose (erythematous or suberythematous), frequency of URV exposure and area of irradiation.\n\nUVB alters Langerhans cells in number, morphology and their main function, which is antigen presentation. These alterations have also been described regarding exposure to UVA.\n\nImmunosupression by UVR is mainly modulated by IL-1β, TNF-α, IL-10 and IL-12. The modification in antigen presentation by Langerhans cells, particularly influenced by IL-10, activates Th2 lymphocytes, to the detriment of Th1. This unbalance leads to more IL-10 and IL-4 production.42 IL-12 seems to have the tendency to neutralize IL-10 action, inhibiting UVR-induced immunosuppression.\n\nImmunosuppression or tolerance induced by UVR seems to be conducted by suppressor/regulatory cells, particularly CD4+ CD25+ and Tr-1.43\n\nIt is believed that the urocanic acid, undergoing photoisomerization from the form trans to the form cis when exposed to UVR, may increase IL-10 production, becoming, therefore, a photoimmunosuppression agent.\n\nThe immunosuppression triggered by UVR leads to alterations of cell response to allergenic and infectious antigens, while allowing the promotion of skin carcinogenesis, which turns UVR into a complete carcinogen (induction/promotion).41\n\nPhotoaging\n\nSkin aging involves intrinsic and extrinsic factors. Intrinsic or chronologic aging is defined as a set of clinical, histological and physiological alterations that take place in the skin non exposed to the sun. Clinically, the skin is atrophic and shows loss of elasticity. The epidermis becomes thinner and the dermoepidermal junction is straightened and flattened, becoming more fragile.44 The tissue reparation process becomes slower, due to diminution of fibroblast metabolism. There is less capacity for proliferation of keratinocytes and fibroblasts, due to smaller response to growth factors. There is also diminution of vitamin D3 synthesis, caused by smaller production of 7-dehydrocholesterol in the altered epidermis.45\n\nExtrinsic aging or photoaging consists in the development of deep wrinkles, skin thickening, dilation of blood vessels and onset of multiple pigmented lesions in photoexposed areas. It is the outcome of a combination of damage caused by UV radiation associated with intrinsic alterations.32 Within the cells, protein codes are stored in the nuclei and mitochondria. Mitochondria are organelles producing adenosine triphosphate (A TP), an energetic molecule. The reactive oxygen species (ROS) are products of this process and may damage lipids, proteins and the DNA itself.46\n\nMitochondrial DNA presents a high mutation rate, due to its deficiency in histones, low repair capacity and proximity to ROS. This unbalance between the oxidative stress and the enzymes that eliminate free radicals has been held responsible as one of the causes of mitochondrial damage.47 Mutations in mitochondrial DNA are observed in larger quantity in photoexposed skin, when compared to photoprotected skin, and apparently UVA is the most involved. As a consequence of this process, skin aging takes place.48\n\nSkin that is little or not photoexposed undergoes a continuous remodeling of dermal collagen. The enzymes responsible for degradation and remodeling of collagen fibers are known as metalloproteinases (MMPs) of the extracellular matrix and are produced by fibroblasts, keratinocytes, macrophages, mastocytes, endothelial cells and eosinophils.30 In photoaging, there is increased synthesis of metalloproteinases, with more collagen breakdown and degradation. This process is stimulated by biochemical pathways through UVR action, with release of several interleukins (IL) and growth factor receptors, such as the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), tumor necrosis factor α (TNF-α), platelet activation factor (PAF), IL-1 and insulin. The accumulation of ROS stimulates the κβ nuclear factor (NF-κβ), which in turn stimulates production of IL-1, IL-5 and TNF-α, generating an inflammatory process in the photoexposed skin and, consequently, more ROS production.45,49\n\nThe UV radiation is able to activate EGFR by means of its phosphorilation. After this event, GTP (guanosine 5'-triphosphate) binding proteins are activated, stimulating MAP kinase cascades (MAPKs). These kinases stimulate transcription of protein activating pathway - 1 (AP-1). The transcription of several MMP families is regulated by the AP-1 complex, formed after UVR. Thus begins the role of MMPs in the degradation of extracellular matrix proteins.49\n\nProfibrotic cytokine TGF-β regulates multiple cellular functions, including differentiation, proliferation and synthesis of the main extracellular matrix proteins, that is, collagen and elastin. In human skin, TGF-β inhibits proliferation of keratinocytes and stimulates fibroblasts. It also inhibits production of some MMPs, thus preventing collagen breakdown. However, UVR is able to inhibit the TGF-β pathway, resulting in decrease of pro-collagen I and increase of MMP synthesis, leading to progressive degradation of collagen fibers.45,50\n\nIn conclusion, chronically irradiated skin may become metabolically more active, leading to epidermal hyperplasia, irregular pigmentation, telangiectasias, elastosis, collagen reduction and wrinkles. Studies have evidenced that wearing sunscreen prevents these alterations associated with photoaging.51,52\n\nPhotocarcinogenesis\n\nPhotocarcinogenesis consists in the development of skin cancers induced by UVR.32 UVR produces radical complexes, such as hydroxyl, aqueous electrons, hydrogen radicals and superoxide. These products, in their great majority, are produced by direct and indirect photosensitive reactions inducing DNA breakdown and base damage, being therefore lethal and mutagenic. In the skin, melanin is an important chromophore, which acts as a filter in the absorption of UVA, UVB and VL radiation. Melanin strongly absorbs visible radiation, helping to transform this energy in heat and dispersing it among hairs and blood vessels (capillaries). It also helps to eliminate radicals, such as hydroxyl and oxygen molecules, preserving the DNA against formation of pyrimidine bases.30,53\n\nThe sensitivity of somatic cells to UVR is due to defects in pyrimidine dimer reparation induced by UVR. It is noteworthy that exposure to UVB leads to formation of cyclobutane - pyrimidine dimers and pyrimidine-pyridone photoproducts, as the main lesions to DNA. The incorrect repair of these products leads to mutations. Furthermore, the UVR may also produce non dimer photoproducts, like cytosine photohydrates, purine photoproducts and single-stranded DNA breakdown.54-56 As regards UVA radiation, its exact role in carcinogenesis is still unkmown.\n\nIn this sense, although the photons in the UVA spectrum are less energetic than UVB ones, it is believed that they can still produce mutations and cancer. As the DNA can absorb little of the UVA energy, the lesions typical of UVB, like pyrimidine dimers, are not important in carcinogenesis caused by UVA. It is assumed that UVA genotoxicity would be induced by indirect mechanisms, where free oxygen radicals are generated after the photons are absorbed by still unidentified photosensitizers.57 When these mutations affect the function of oncogenes and of tumor suppressor genes, such as TP53, PTCH1, BRM and RAS, there is a loss of cellular cycle control, with possible keratinocyte and melanocyte transformation and the onset of tumors.58\n\nThe photoexposed skin is susceptible both to non-melanoma skin cancers, such as basal cell cancer and squamous cell cancer, and to melanoma. The non-melanoma skin cancers have been strongly linked to UV radiation exposure, since both UVA and UVB cause DNA damage and immunosuppression.59 As to melanoma, a direct relationship has been demonstrated between UVR exposure and the risk to develop this type of tumor. However, there seems to be an association with acute and intense exposure.60\n\nEffects of visible light\n\nVL is the part of electromagnetic radiation visible to the human eye and it represents around 40% of all solar radiation reaching the surface of the Earth.61 Its effects on the skin have been extensively studied.\n\nIt was observed that, in large doses, VL causes cutaneous erythema. When a source of light emitting 98.3% of VL, 1.5% of infrared radiation and 0.19% of UVA-1 was used, Mahmoud et al. demonstrated that the type of skin is the main factor determining the intensity and duration of this signal. VL induces erythema in skins with phototypes IV to VI, which disappears within a two-hour period. In these types of skin, the degree of erythema escalates with the increase of VL doses. However, it cannot be induced in phototype II skin, even at high fluencies.\n\nThe authors proposed that perhaps VL induces a reaction inside the chromophores that generates heat, and then increased concentrations of melanin in higher phototypes would result in more production of heat, leading to vasodilation and erythema.61\n\nAs regards pigmentation, limited information is available on the role of VL. In a study by Ramasubramaniam et al.62 in India, it was observed that immediate pigmentation induced by VL was not significantly different from that produced by UV radiation, and that the spectra of action of VL and UVR upon inducing pigmentation were similar. Nevertheless, when compared to VL, UVR is 25 times more efficient to induce pigmentation. The investigators also concluded that the persistent pigmentation response afforded by VL is significantly less intense than that induced by UVR.62 Likewise, Mahmoud et al. also found evidence that pigmentation can be induced by VL.61\n\nIt seems that VL also contributes to free radical production. A study carried out in 2006 with simulated solar radiation on ex-vivo skin revealed that the presence of ascorbate radicals was directly proportional to irradiation. The production of this radical by UVR and VL in the corneal layer was approximately 67% and 35%, respectively.63\n\nFinally, there was evidence that VL, together with IR, promotes an increase in MMPs, diminishing the expression of procollagen type I, therefore contributing to photoaging.64\n\nAlthough artificial sources emit visible light, there are no studies demonstrating that the dose received is sufficient to lead to the above described effects.\n\nEffects of infrared radiation\n\nInfrared radiation (IR) consists in wavelengths longer than 780 nm and up to 1 mm, representing approximately 50% of the solar radiation that reaches the Earth. It has been divided into IR-A (780-1400 nm), IR-B (1400-3000 nm) and IR-C (3000 to 1 mm). IR-A and IR-B can penetrate the epidermis, the dermis and the subcutaneous tissue, while IR-C is almost completely absorbed by the epidermis due to the presence of water. IR exposure is noticed by human beings through heat sensation.65\n\nStudies have revealed that IR can cause temporary erythema, probably secondary to vasodilation by thermal effect.66,67 Another important observation is that infrared radiation, especially IR-A, contributes to photoaging. The mechanisms involved in this process have been investigated. It is assumed that they include: metalloproteinase-1 induction without induction of its inhibitor, the tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase-1, which results in collagen breakdown,68 disorder in electron flow of the mitochondrial electron transport chain, leading to an inadequate production of energy by dermal fibroblasts;69 angiogenesis stimulation and increased number of mastocytes.70\n\nFinally, there was evidence that the IR-A seems to be associated with oxidative stress. Darvin et al. proposed that free radical formation would be influenced by the increased temperature occurring during IR radiation.71 Jung et al. examined the heat effects on the association between IR and free radical formation in in vitro model of human fibroblast. They demonstrated that IR exposure at a temperature of 37ºC did not induce free radicals; however, at temperatures of 39ºC or higher, free radicals were produced.72\n\nPhotodermatoses\n\nSeveral skin diseases can be influenced by sunlight.73\n\nIdiopathic photodermatoses:\n\nPolymorphic light eruption\n\nActinic prurigo\n\nSolar urticaria\n\nHydroa vacciniforme\n\nChronic actinic dermatitis\n\nPhototoxic contact dermatitis\n\nPhotoallergic contact dermatitis\n\nPhotosensitivity caused by medications - by toxicity or allergy\n\nIt occurs with diuretics, antibiotics, antipsychotics, sedatives, anti-hypertensives, non-hormonal anti-inflammatories, oral hypoglycemic agents and others.\n\nGenophotodermatoses:\n\nXeroderma pigmentosum\n\nTrichothiodystrophy\n\nCutaneous porphyria\n\nKindler-Weary syndrome\n\nBloom syndrome\n\nRothmund-Thomson syndrome\n\nCockayne syndrome\n\nDiseases that are aggravated by sunlight\n\nMelasma\n\nVitiligo\n\nLupus erythematosus\n\nDermatomyositis\n\nReticular erythematous mucinosis (REM)\n\nEczema\n\nSeborrheic dermatitis\n\nPsoriasis\n\nPityriasis rubra pilaris\n\nAcne vulgaris\n\nRosacea\n\nLichen planus\n\nEndemic pemphigus foliaceus\n\nBullous pemphigoid\n\nFamilial benign chronic pemphigus (Hailey-Hailey disease)\n\nGrover disease\n\nPellagra\n\nCarcinoid syndrome\n\nCutaneous T-cell linphoma\n\nDisseminated superficial actinic porokeratosis\n\nDarier's disease\n\nPolymorphus erythema\n\nHartnup syndrome\n\nDiseases caused by UVR immunosuppression\n\nHerpes simplex\n\nViral exanthema\n\nVerruca plana\n\nSkin carcinomas\n\nRECOMMENDATIONS OF THE BRAZILIAN SOCIETY OF DERMATOLOGY\n\nStudies that can better assess the characteristics of the Brazilian population regarding the effects of solar radiation should be encouraged, especially the search for more adequate skin type classification methods when compared to Fitzpatrick's Classification.\n\nAs regards public health, the escalation of skin neoplasm incidence in the Brazilian population and the importance of solar radiation in the development of such diseases justify the concern about implementation of photoprotection actions.\n\nSBD recommends the development of investigations that can better clarify the effect of non-ultraviolet radiation on the skin.\n\nPHOTOPROTECTION\n\nGENERAL CONCEPT\n\nAlthough it has not been clearly defined in literature, photoprotection could be understood as a group of measures directed to reducing sun exposure and preventing the development of acute and chronic actinic damage.\n\nThe following are considered photoprotective measures: photoprotection education (photoeducation), topic photoprotection, oral photoprotection and mechanic photoprotection (achieved by roofs and glass, clothes and accessories).\n\nThe success of an adequate photoprotection program depends on the combination of the largest possible number of measures, taking into account the profile of the patient, including age, phenotypical characteristics (phenotype, color of skin, eyes and hair), habits, professional activity, geographic location of domicile, individual and familial antecedents of sun exposure-related diseases.\n\nIt is up to the healthcare professional, particularly the dermatologist, to identify and promote measures that are appropriate for the patient or the population group involved.\n\nThe following chapters seek to present, in condensed form, the main characteristics of different photoprotection measures, their indications and the recommendations of the Brazilian Society of Dermatology (Sociedade Brasileira de Dermatologia - SBD) for each situation.\n\nCHAPTER 3\n\nPHOTOEDUCATION\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nThe term \"photoeducation\" was introduced in 1988 to integrate the basic photoprotection concepts, determining why, where and how important protection against harmful effects of UV radiation (UVR) is. Over time the photoeducation concept was expanded, with emphasis on the positive and negative effects of sun exposure.74,75\n\nThe consequences of excessive photoexposure depend on genetic, behavioral and geographic situation factors, as well as on the influence of external agents, such as concomitant diseases, transplants and use of medications. Among the negative effects of the mentioned photoexposure above the acceptable levels are premature aging, influence on the immunological status and mainly the onset of skin cancers.\n\nSkin cancer is the neoplasm with the highest incidence in several countries in the world, including Brazil, with increased morbidity and mortality deriving from its progression. Multiple factors seem to be related to these findings, among them the change of habits of the population regarding solar exposure, estethical valuation of skin tanning and especially the increased exposure to ultraviolet radiation (UVR).76,77\n\nThere are estimates that, in the whole world, 45% of the cancers that may be prevented are cutaneous and that most of the deaths caused by melanoma could be avoided.77-79 In this sense, several studies have emphasized the need for educational photoprotection measures for the population.80,81 Even patients who have already been diagnosed with cutaneous neoplasms have diverse behaviors regarding careful awareness of sun exposure and they do not always change their routine, including tanning habits.82\n\nACTIONS FOR THE YOUNG PUBLIC\n\nSeveral factors turn children and adolescents into a quite important public for photoeducation campaigns: solar exposure at the beginning of life has a crucial impact on the onset of skin cancer; children are more receptive than adults to receive guidance regarding prevention; photoprotection habits acquired in childhood and adolescence may modify behaviors and even affect the attitudes of the parents.83-85\n\nThere are several models that have been succesful in this regard, involving measures like sending mail and information, continued education programs at school and even national programs to encourage photoprotection.86-89\n\nIt is of fundamental importance to adopt measures in accordance with the age group of the population. Information directed to children younger than 8 years of age should have a different approach than that directed to preadolescents and adolescents. Two systematic reviews concluded that educational measures to improve behavior concerning solar protection in elementary school and recreational activities were effective.90,91\n\nThere are studies showing that small modifications in child behavior promoted with educational models implemented in schools, such as the SunWise School Program, developed by the US Environmental Protection Agency, significantly reduce the risk for skin cancer, consequently reducing expenses with this health problem for society.92\n\nThere are few randomized studies to assess actions in health related to photoprotection and photoeducation, but evidences suggest that the participation of schools is essential.93 They are the easiest way to reach children and adolescents. In this regard, it is interesting to have the contents inserted into science and human physiology programs, with the relative depth of their degree of understanding. Transmission of knowledge may take many varied forms, including theater plays and dramatizations that allow active participation. They are ludic and the most appropriate for some age groups.\n\nThe content should focus the fact that there are benefits and drawbacks, and that the intensity of damage depends on the resistance of the skin and of individual habits.94 In addition, schools are important intervention locations, as the students spend a lot of time in outdoor activities.92,95 The experience of other countries shows interesting alternatives, like the USA where the CDC (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention) prepared a routine of norms to guide schools in the implementation of programs for skin cancer prevention.96\n\nThe World Health Organization (WHO) has also divulged guidelines for an initiative entitled \"Solar Protection and Schools: How to make a difference\". In this sense there are not only guidelines regarding the importance of this type of strategy but also a practical manual about implementing these practices in the schools.97\n\nExamples of other actions targeted at skin cancer prevention and directed at children include initiatives like the Brazilian Society of Dermatology (Sociedade Brasileira de Dermatologia - SBD) children section in their website and the campaign \"The Sun, a Friend of the Children (Sol Amigo da Infância)\" which, in addition to the distribution of comic books, sponsored teacher training and the preparation of a law project.98\n\nThere is a law project currently going through the motions to be approved that aims at establishing the program \"Skin Cancer Prevention - The Sun, a Friend of the Children\" as a mandatory extracurricular activity for preschool and elementary I and II children at public and private school networks. According to this project, dermatologists certified by the Brazilian Medical Association (Associação Médica Brasileira) will conduct teacher training on the adequate content for children and adolescents.\n\nAnother important aspect to be considered regarding photoeducation is that the strategies should be adapted to reach adolescents, including orientation about the harmful effects of indoor tanning.99-101 A study carried out in Brazil showed that adolescents are aware of the damage caused by the sun but, despite this fact, believe that tanning improves the appearance and justifies the risk.83 In other countries, the scenario is similar: despite the knowledge about the harmful results of excessive sun exposure, behavior changes among the adolescents are unsatisfactory.102\n\nThe orientation programs should also be included in the educational content, by means of guided study such as review work, search on the Internet and participation in the creation of educational tools like websites and through the social networks.103 It is recommended to promote lectures with specialists trained in the language of young people, mainly medical students, who would be more appropriate than older educators. In addition, it is important to offer the possibility of clearing doubts, including availability for private talks, showing alternatives to the esthetic aspect of tanning.\n\nACTIONS FOR THE ADULT POPULATION\n\nThere are few randomized clinical studies that assess photoeducation interventions in adults.85 Most of them are based on computer models to generate orientation, which varied from 15 minute sessions to counseling given by professionals in person, in writing or by telephone.104-108 The behavior differences in relation to sun exposure after the interventions, although statistically significant, were small and it is still not clear if they are clinically representative.85\n\nAs regards young adults, studies conducted with college students focused the issue of attempting to change standards based on the appearance, that is, highlighted the harmful effects of ultraviolet radiation in photoaging, rather than messages related to skin cancer prevention.109-112 The interventions varied from fact sheets to 30-minute videos. When groups that used artificial tanning were evaluated after the intervention there was a 35% decrease; however, the follow-up period of these studies was short.109,111,112\n\nMost of the interventions that were effective in promoting behavior modifications regarding photo-protection incorporated the use of computers. All of the studies with young adults focused the concern with the appearance, emphasizing the harmful effects of sun regarding premature aging. There is evidence that this argument makes this population group more sensitive to guidance, especially the women. It is interesting to highlight that interventions regarding photoeducation should vary in accordance with gender and age.85\n\nAnother group of people who are particularly susceptible to the risk of excessive sun exposure are workers who are engaged in outdoor activities; data show the increase of pre-neoplastic lesions and nonmelanocytic neoplasms.113 These individuals are traditionally more resistant to change of habits and wearing photoprotection because they believe it is a waste of time or it is uncomfortable.\n\nThe perception of attitudes taken by the hiring company, like the implementation of programs, is a strong factor of change for its employees, more marked in those with lighter phototypes, in women, in those with a better educational level and those that always work in open areas.114,115\n\nResults of other countries cannot always be extrapolated to Brazil, but we know that our problems are similar, the climate may be very adverse in several regions of the country and that some companies already include photoprotection among their occupational safety requirements. The result of these initiatives may bring relevant data to the upcoming campaigns and health policies.\n\nA questionnaire was recently proposed and validated to estimate the current and past characteristics of photoexposure, as well as photoprotection practices (Sun Exposure and Behaviour Inventory - SEBI).116 This instrument may become very useful in studies about the incidence of skin cancer and risk modifications, as it will allow data comparison, currently very difficult due to the different methods and evaluations used in the studies.\n\nLAY MEDIA APPROACH\n\nThe impact of written and/or visualized information is very important regarding knowledge, perception of risk and behavior modifications. Studies carried out in Austria demonstrated that printed media, television, radio and family are the most relevant in terms of adherence to changes, much more than medical advice. The Internet is more used by male individuals, while women are more attentive to printed material in magazines and information supplied by companies that manufacture sunscreens. At the same time, most of the interviewed believe that the doctor is the most reliable source of information and that flyers or posters attract little attention.117\n\nThese results demonstrate that the photoeducation approach should include different resources and that the doctor must be an actor adequately trained in multiple techniques to guarantee a lasting promotion of good health habits.118\n\nEducational campaigns targeted at different types of public have been promoted in several countries, in an effort to diminish the tendency of increase in skin neoplasm cases. Although these campaigns have increased attention regarding cutaneous cancer, they have not resulted in behavior modification, and the majority of the people continue to rely only on sunscreen as protection, even increasing the time of exposure because they believe they are protected.119,120\n\nBeing tanned continues to have a strong impact on the perception of physical attractiveness, especially among adolescents and young adults.120 There is great contribution of the media to that effect, attributing a positive esthetic appeal to outdoor activities in the sun, showing opinion leaders and fashion models always tanned. Furthermore, it is commonly believed that darker skins show imperfections less and the general aspect is improved by sharper contrast with clothes and even the scenario.120\n\nIn order to achieve modification of tanning habits, the concept of \"being tanned is a synonym of beauty\" should be modified. Direct or subliminary messages should be positive and perceived as rewards, since individuals rarely respond to negative affirmations, without an immediate benefit.\n\nThe attitude of emphasizing the advantages of careful solar exposure to preserve health and beauty, as well as detailed description of the consequences of excessive sun exposure in terms of pigment alterations, drying of skin and premature onset of wrinkles may be more effective than warnings about a distant and not confirmed risk of neoplasms.121,122\n\nThe complicity of lay persons who are not part of the medical environment, mainly those the public identifies with in real life or would like to resemble brings results of great significance. Different forms of communication at premium times, through channels accessible to all types of public, examples of real situations that are repeated and associated with success and attractiveness have a great chance of being effective for that purpose.\n\nHealth education and prevention may be easily integrated into doctor-patient communication. However, this measure alone does not have the required coverage. Mass communication requires a coherent, direct and always consistent speech, regardless of the professional involved.\n\nIn order to achieve this goal it is necessary for messages to be based on supporting material prepared by specialists, not only regarding the medical aspect but also the communication. They should be conveyed in all possible ways, from schools and universities, above all taking the opportunities offered by the media, as TV, radio and newspapers. Associations of specialists, such as the Brazilian Society of Dermatology, are able to supply and divulge routines to contact communication media keeping the content uniform.\n\nRECOMMENDATIONS OF THE BRAZILIAN CONSENSUS ON PHOTOPROTECTION:\n\nActions targeted at photoeducation should be divided into four large groups: Children and Adolescents, Adults, Outdoor Workers and Media Actions.\n\nActions for the public composed of Children and Adolescents:\n\nThe school should participate in this type of education and it is the easiest way to reach children and adolescents.\n\nActions targeted at children younger that 8 years of age should have a different focus than those targeted at preadolescents and adolescents.\n\nIncorporate into the school curriculum a space for education regarding photoprotection and photoeducation.\n\nAdolescents should receive orientation about the harmful effects of tanning.\n\nEstablish a long-term photoeducation program combining SBD and governmental initiatives, as well as third sector non-governmental institutions.\n\nActions for the adult population:\n\nWhen targeted at young adults, the harmful effects of ultraviolet radiation in photoaging should be emphasized more than messages related to skin cancer prevention.\n\nThe participation of public figures increases adherence to and visibility of campaigns, which was confirmed in our National Skin Cancer Campaign. Nevertheless, such participations should be continued.\n\nKeep photoprotection guidance as part of the permanent campaign of SBD.\n\nInclude Photobiology and Photoprotection classes in the Undergraduate Medical curriculum. SBD could contribute with the preparation of the plan and minimum content of this presentation.\n\nActions for outdoor workers\n\nDevelop education projects on photoprotection to be presented at the companies that employ workers who are engaged in outdoor activities.\n\nDevelop projects to better assess methods able to measure the level of solar radiation to which outdoor workers are exposed.\n\nOffer continuous training to doctors of companies with the above described profile.\n\nPromote efforts, together with governmental authorities, to create specific legislation about sunscreen transformation and photoprotective measures like wearing Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) for outdoor workers.\n\nMedia Actions:\n\nOffer training programs to specialized media about the effects of solar radiation and prevention mechanisms.\n\nDevelop within the roll of SBD members, through the department of photobiology, a group of dermatologists especially prepared to respond to media requests and give interviews or clarification as SBD spokespersons.\n\nPrepare and keep available to members the norms of conduct and posture before the media, as well as detailed instructions regarding the position of SBD on photoprotection issues, so that the message is clear and uniform.\n\nCHAPTER 4\n\nSUNSCREENS\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nHistorically, sunscreens have been idealized to prevent sunburn in labor activities and to prolong outdoor leisure and sport time spent in the sun, in addition to permiting a certain degree of tanning. The first formulas date back to 1928 and aimed at reducing the incidence of UVR-B, the main inducer of erythema and DNA damage, on the skin.123\n\nIt was only in the 70s that commercial scale production of topical sunscreen was started, making their use popular. Studies in the 80s evidenced the importance of UVR-A in photoaging and its coadjuvant role in cutaneous carcinogenesis.123\n\nConceptually, topical sunscreen (or sunscreen) are products that are applied on the skin, composed of substances that interfere with solar radiation, reducing its biological effects on the tissues.124\n\nCHAPTER 4 A -\n\nFORMULATION OF TOPICAL SUNSCREEN\n\nUV FILTERS\n\nUltraviolet filters are the elements present in photoprotector formulas that interfere directly with the incident solar radiation through absorption, reflection or dispersion of energy.123\n\nFrom the structural viewpoint, ultraviolet filters may be organic or inorganic compounds. The organic actives (or chemical filters) absorb UVR photons, promoting an alteration in their molecular structure. The inorganic actives (or physical filters) have a mineral origin and promote the reflection of UVR to the external part of the tissue.125\n\nOrganic filters are conjugated aromatic compounds that operate through a molecular mechanism of UVR absorption and return of this energy to the environment by means of emission of longer and less energetic wavelengths, such as visible light and infrared radiation.125\n\nCompared to inorganic filters, they present a greater potential of sensitization, greater risk of percutaneous absorption and smaller photostability, strongly dependent on its chemical structure and combination of actives in the formula.125\n\nMore recently, a new generation of organic filters was presented, with larger photostability and lower potential of dermal permeation, substantially reducing the risk for development of sensitization.125\n\nDepending on their molecular structure, the organic filters may better absorb UVB or UVA radiation. Some more recent molecules are able to produce peaks of UVA and UVB absorption and, for that reason, are called broad spectrum filters.125\n\nInorganic filters present a minimum potential for allergic sensitization and high photostability. However, their reflective properties may cause excessive shine and a whitish aspect, limiting their exclusive use to formulas due to the low cosmetic acceptance.126\n\nInorganic filters like zinc oxide and titanium dioxide act on the surface of the skin, reflecting incident radiation; nevertheless, when micronized, they may permeate the corneal layer and in addition to reflection, act by diffraction and dispersion.\n\nThe size of the particles of the inorganic filters is, therefore, a factor that determines their effect. The smaller the particle, the better the skin coverage and, consequently, reflection; but refraction is worse. Therefore, reflection and refraction are inversely related. The efficiency of inorganic filters is related to the size and dispersion of their particles.126\n\nWhen micronized, these filters diminish the whitish appearance of the skin and favor the stability of the emulsion. They may be coated with silicone, silica, aluminum oxide, estearic acid, aluminum estearate, among others, improving the dispersion of the filter, avoiding agglomeration of particles and altering the rheology of the emulsion. Titanium dioxide, for example, can only be associated with avobenzone when coated with silica and dimeticone. On the other hand, only some inorganic filters with particle sizes larger than 200 nm are able to reflect in the visible light range, therefore offering protection.126\n\nThe different photoprotector actives also present curves characteristic of UVR absorbance. Usually, commercial sunscreen use a composition of physical and chemical filters to expand the photoprotection spectrum (UVA and UVB), explore synergistic properties and minimize the adverse effects linked to a specific active.\n\nIn Brazil, sunscreen are categorized by the Brazilian Health Surveillance Agency (ANVISA) as cosmetics (risk degree: 2), which waives the need for a medical prescription to be sold. However, there are regulations concerning the UV filters permitted and the need for studies to be carried out to ascertain their safety and efficacy.127,128\n\nlists 33 actives regulated by ANVISA for commercial use in Brazil.\n\nCHART 2\n\nFILTER (COMMON OR COMMERCIAL NAME)OTHER NAMES/INCI*COVERAGEANVISA*PABA4-Aminobenzoic acidUVB15Padimate OEthylhexyl dimethyl PABA (EHDP)UVB8Ethoxylated EthylPEG-25 PABAUVB10-4-AminobenzoateMexoryl SOCamphor benzalkoniumUVB6methosulfateMexoryl SD3-Benzylidene camphorUVB2Eusolex 63004-methylbenzydilidene camphor (MBC)UVB4Mexoryl SWPolyacryamidomethyl benzylidene camphorUVB6Mexoryl SLBenzylidene Camphor Sulfonic AcidUVB6% (expres-sed as acid)CinoxateCinoxateUVB3Neoheliopan E1000Isoamyl p-methoxycinnamateUVB10Parsol MCXEthylhexyl methoxycinnamate (OMC ou EHMC)UVB10Neo Heliopan OSEthylhexyl salicilate (EHS)UVB5Eusolex HMSHomosalateUVB15Neo Heliopan TESTriethanolamine salicylate TEA salicilatoUVB12Parsol SLXPolysilicone-15UVB10Eusolex OCROctocrylene (OCR)UVB10 (of acid)Neo Heliopan HydroEusolex 232Phenylbenzimidazole Sulfonic acid (PBSA)UVB8 (as acid)Uvasorb HEBDiethylhexyl butamido triazone (DBT)UVB10Uvinul T150Ethylhexyl Triazone (EHT)UVB5Benzophenone-3 (Oxybenzone)Benzophenone-3 (BP-3)UVA/B10Benzophenone-4Benzophenone-4 (acid) (BP-4)UVA/B10 (expressedas acid)Benzophenone-5Benzophenone-5 (Na)UVA/B5% (expres-sed as acid)Benzophenone-8Benzophenone-8UVA/B3MerediMateMenthyl anthranilate (MA)UVA5AvobenzoneParsol 1789Butyl methoxy dibenzoyl methane (BMBM)UVA5Neo Heliopan APDisodium phenyl dibenzimidazole tetrasulfonate (DPDT)UVA10% (expres-sed as acid)Mexoryl SXTerephthalylidene dicamphor sulfonic acid (TDSA)UVA10 (expressedas acid)Uvinul A PlusDiethylamino hydroxybenzoyl hexil benzoate (DHHB)UVA10Mexoryl XLDrometrizole trisiloxane (DTS)UVA/B15Tinosorb SBis-ethylhexyloxyphenol methoxyphenyl triazine (BEMT)UVA/B10Tinosorb MMethylene bis-benzotriazolyl tetramethylbutylphenolUVA/B10Titanium DioxideTitanium DioxideUVA/B25Zinc OxideZinc OxideUVA/B25\n\nIn addition to protection against ultraviolet radiation, there has been interest about actives able to interfere with visible light and infrared radiation.\n\nFilters able to protect against visible light act only by a reflection mechanism, producing a whitish aspect with low cosmetic acceptance. As an alternative, formulators use different pigments as active blockers in this radiation range, that give an appearance of makeup foundation to the formula, limiting its use by some individuals, mainly those of the male sex.\n\nUp to the moment, there are no ANVISA approved substances able to absorb, disperse or reflect in the infrared range. Sunscreen that have the ability to protect against infrared radiation achieve it through the addition of ingredients that can reduce cellular or molecular damage derived from this radiation.\n\nThe different photoprotective actives present characteristics of solubility, compatibility among themselves, their vehicles and supplements, besides curves of solar spectrum absorbance that rule the choice of topical photoprotector formulation components.129\n\nTechnologies for vehiculation of actives\n\nThe processes of vehiculation of actives based on particles allow the control of molecule release at different tissue levels. The different polymers behave as vectors of the actives and divide into monolithic type and reservoir type.\n\nIn monolithic vectors, the active is adsorbed by the particle surface. According to the size of the polymeric particles used, the vectors may be classified as microparticles (1-250 micra) and nanoparticles (1-100 nm).\n\nIn systems of controlled release like the reservoir type, the active is involved by a membrane or another colloidal complex such as liposomes, cyclodextrine, nanocapsules and microemulsions).\n\nMicro and nanoencapsulation of organic filters is a strategy to improve retention in the skin, provide photostability and increase effectiveness for favoring the formation of a film on the surface of the tissue.\n\nThe use of solid lipidic nanoparticles, for example, reduces systemic absorption of oxybenzone, increasing its concentration in the corneal layer and demanding smaller concentrations of the active to reach the desired effectiveness.130\n\nThe capture of organic actives in silica microspheres, for example, improves solubility of actives in water, reducing chemical incompatibility problems among actives and tissue hypersensitivity reactions.\n\nCOMPOSITION OF SUNSCREEN AND PHARMACEUTICAL FORMULAS\n\nA pharmaceutical formula is composed of active ingredient, vehicle and excipients (emollients/solvents, emulsifiers, moisturizers, preservatives, fragrance, stabilizers, therapeutic supplements, among others). The substance that will develop the desired therapeutic activity is called active ingredient. The vehicle is the excipient appearing in the formula in the largest amount, promoting incorporation of the other components. It does not have a specific effect, but may interfere in the final result of the formula and in photoprotective activity.130\n\nDepending on the vehicle used (according to its composition and physical-chemical state), the type of formula, as well as the type of skin it is recommended for may be identified. The other components, called excipients or additives, should be inert; however, they have an important role in the preparation, stability, appearance, safety and effect of the product.\n\nEmulsifiers, auxiliary ingredients, fragrance and preservatives are examples of excipients. The choice of vehicle, excipients and pharmaceutical formula should take into account the active ingredient chosen, the objective of the treatment and the characteristics' of the patient that will use the product.131,132\n\nSome polymers are added to the formula to control spreadability, absorption and formation of film on the skin, which should be homogeneous and stable in conditions of sweat, heat and minimal physical contact. The quality of film formation is one of the most important characteristics for continuance of the photoprotector effect.\n\nThe solvents (emulsifiers) used in the formulas to make the mixture of organic filters with the vehicle possibly interfere in the characteristic absorption curve of actives, as well as in the photoprotective measures of the formula. It is a known fact that even order, speed, technique and temperature of the mixture of formula components generate final products with different properties and may interfere in the effectiveness of the photoprotector, which should alert dermatologists regarding the reliability of sunscreen masterful formulas.\n\nTopical sunscreen may be used in different pharmaceutic formulas.129-134\n\nOils: The first sunscreen preparations used oil as vehicle. They were popularly known as tanning lotions. They are monophasic formulations with good spreadability, easy application and very stable when incorporating liposoluble actives. In such cases, manipulation is simple and can be done at room temperature. Unfortunately, the easy application results in low effectiveness as it leaves a thin transparent film on the skin, with reduced SPF. The cosmetic effect is also a limiting factor.\n\nGels: Gels are vehicles composed of a liquid phase, usually water or alcohol, and another solid, represented by gelling agents. The latter are most often polymeric substances, interpenetrated by a liquid so as to modify their physical state (rheology). According to the quantity of gelling agents present in a formula, different types of rheological effects may be obtained. A smaller quantity will obtain serum, after that a fluid, then a gel and a larger quantity, starch gel. In addition to modifying the physical state of the formula, the quantity of gelling agent may result in a \"sticky\", inadequate formula.\n\nThe photoprotective gels incorporate hydrosoluble actives that actually are compounds insoluble in water that, associated with solubilizers (usually non ionic surfactants), allow their incorporation. Hydroalcoholic bases, on the other hand, may allow the dissolution of liposoluble molecules in alcohol, and in this manner be solubilized in water. These vehicles may be classified, regarding the type of disperser used, into hydrophilic or hydrogels; alcoholic and hydrophobic or oil gels. The photoprotective gels should have a pleasant appearance, easy application and removal, fast drying, smoothness and elasticity. Their main indication is for oily or acneic skins.\n\nEmulsions: Emulsions are composed of an oily phase and a watery phase, not miscible, that through the action of an emulsifying agent form a homogeneous mixture. These special surfactants allow two systems that are immiscible to disperse and form a stable product. The composition of this pharmaceutic formula presents then a dispersed phase and an interface. This vehicle has the properties of being versatile, cosmetically pleasant and compatible with the incorporation of lipo- and hydrosoluble substances, which make it one of the most prescribed topical pharmaceutic formula.\n\nEmulsions may be classified in several ways: by the physical aspect they may be liquid (fluid emulsions or milks) or pasty (creams); by the pH they may be acid, alkaline or neutral. However, the most commonly used classification takes into consideration the proportion between the oily and the watery phases, that is, they may be grouped according to the predominant dispersing media. This way oil in water or water in oil emulsions may be obtained. Nowadays, the outstanding emulsions are: silicone in water, propylene glycol in silicone, triphasic emulsions, microemulsions and polymeric emulsions, often called pseudo-emulsions. Sunscreens may be incorporated into any of them, as long as the adequate pharmacotechnique is employed.\n\nThe oil in water emulsions (O/W) present low greasiness, produce a refreshing effect, dry rapidly and may be easily washed in water. Such advantages are due to the fact that the continuous phase of the emulsion is watery, and the dispersive phase, oily. The water in oil emulsions (W/O) have a greater percentage of oil, and this is the continuous phase. They make the skin greasier and shiny; repeal water and offer protection against humidity and cold. However, they are thermolabile.\n\nCream Gel: The cream gels result from the incorporation of a gelling agent into an emulsion. They are very popular in photoprotective formulations, especially in tropical countries, for imparting the sensory effect of gels and the softness of emulsions, without their disadvantages (stickiness and greasiness, respectively). They are indicated for daily use in sunscreen, including for people with oily skin, as they incorporate fat sequestering agents.\n\nMousses: A mousse is typically a fluid emulsion to which a propellent was added. They require special flasks with a valve that, when pressed, releases an elegant, easy to use and easily spreadable foam.\n\nAerosols: Aerosols are colloidal dispersions of a liquid in the atmosphere. They are usually oily, which may enhance their spreadability, but make the skin greasy. Modern formulas, with silicone or similar substances, have been employed as sunscreen that have good acceptance but questionable results, not only by the difficulty in assessing the amount applied, but also for its irregular distribution on the skin. They are more useful when used to reinforce the effect of a photoprotector worn in the form of emulsion or gel, when a reapplication is necessary.\n\nSticks: Composed of waxes and oils, they have a solid or semisolid structure to which inorganic and/or liposoluble organic filters are incorporated. This association results in products that are quite water resistant. They are indicated for application on the lips, as lip pencil, dorsum of the nose, or other restricted skin areas.\n\nPowders and Foundations: These are cosmetic products designed for makeup, reducing skin shine, giving it uniform color and texture, besides protecting from solar radiation. Inorganic filters are usually incorporated into face powders; however, both organic and inorganic filters may be used in fluid foundations and compact powders.\n\nsummarizes characteristics of formulas connected with the vehicles utilized.\n\nCHART 3\n\nPresentationSkin sensationWater ResistantNeed for ReapplicationCream/Lotion (emulsion)PleasantYesLess FrequentMoussePleasantYesLess FrequentOily GelOilyYesLess FrequentAqueous GelPleasantNoFrequentHydroalcoholic GelPleasantYesLess FrequentCreamy GelPleasantYesLess FrequentSticksGreasyYesLess FrequentSpray/AerosolOilyYesLess FrequentOilOilyYesLess Frequent\n\nOTHER ACTIVES IN SUNSCREEN FORMULAS\n\nOne of the issues involved is adherence of the user to daily and routine wearing of sunscreen.135 Many times, sunscreens are perceived as sticky or uncomfortable products to wear. At the same time, the patients do not perceive the benefits derived from their use, since prevention of photo damage and skin cancer occur mainly on a long term basis.136 In this regard, sunscreen containing other actives in the same formula have been developed by the pharmaceutical industry with the intention of offering, in addition to photoprotective properties, benefits that may be felt in the short term, thus encouraging frequent use and guaranteeing better protection against the sun.\n\nMoisturizers in sunscreen\n\nTopical moisturizers are substances designed to improve and maintain the cutaneous barrier.137 They are used to restore the barrier function of the epidermis, cover small cutaneous microfissures, provide a soft protective film and increase the amount of water in the epidermis, while improving the appearance and tactile properties of the skin.138 Occlusive substances like dimethicone and petrolatum, as well as moisturizers, such as glycerol and propylene glycol, among others, may be used for this purpose.\n\nStudies demonstrate that products containing moisturizers and sunscreens in the same formulation are able to provide effective photoprotection against actinic damage.139 At the same time, they may be useful in helping to maintain and restore the epidermal barrier. Such characteristics encourage acceptance and adherence of the user, favoring routine application of the product.\n\nAntioxidants\n\nFree radicals are species that present unpaired electrons. In live systems, free radicals are represented mainly by reactive oxygen species (ROS). They are extremely unstable and tend to rapidly react with neighboring molecules, donating one electron (oxidation). When not neutralized by antioxidants, they may lead to cascading reactions with subsequent cellular damage.140\n\nIn addition to endogenous sources of free radicals (mainly mitochondrial oxidative metabolism) there are exogenous sources, among them ultraviolet radiation (UVR).140 There are several studies that ascertain the participation of UVR, through excessive ROS production, into degenerative molecular and cellular processes that lead to photoaging, immunosupression and carcinogenesis.140-143\n\nAlthough there are endogenous control mechanisms of cellular oxidative stress in face of more extreme situations, these mechanisms may be overcharged and fail.143 In this regard, besides physical and chemical filters, other photoprotective strategies are being investigated, among them the antioxidants (AOx).\n\nThe beneficial effect of AOx associated with sunscreen has been demonstrated in humans.144,145 Moreover, there is vast literature about the antioxidant ability of some substances.146-149 Nevertheless, creating formulations that combine sunscreen and AOx while guaranteeing the effectiveness of both in the final product is still a challenge.143,149\n\nUsually, AOx are naturally unstable and should remain stable and bioavailable in the final formulation. At the same time, AOx must penetrate the corneal layer and remain in adequate concentrations in the epidermis and dermis as long as it is desired that sunscreen continue on the surface of the skin for appropriate protection. From a legal viewpoint, when this benefit is mentioned on labels, it becomes necessary to ascertain its safety and bioavailability in the formula.\n\nIn vivo studies are required to determine the best AOx to be used in these formulas and how these products will be formulated to guarantee the effectiveness of all components.\n\nRepellents in sunscreen\n\nAccording to ANVISA, repellents are classified as cosmetics and follow a specific legislation150 which determines the allowed ingredients and concentrations, while demanding safety and effectiveness studies. As happens with sunscreen, ANVISA also determines that repellent labels should include certain mandatory information.\n\nThe best known repellent active is diethyltoluamide (DEET), which presents toxicity and effectiveness against several mosquito species like Anopheles, Phlebotomus, Aedes, Culicidae, ticks and fleas.151,152\n\nRegarding the addition of solar protection actives in repellents, although the ingredients may be used in a formula, there are a few details to be considered: the ability of the sunscreen to filter ultraviolet radiation may be diminished by repellents such as DEET, which is the most common, while the toxicity of the repellent is increased by the sunscreen, especially in children.153,154\n\nThe problem is exacerbated by the application instructions, which are a paradox: while sunscreen should be generously and frequently applied (every two hours or more often, if necessary), insect repellents (DEET) should be applied no more frequently than every two to six hours, depending on the concentration.151,155\n\nThere are other repellent actives, like essences and icaridin, but their benefits when associated with sunscreen have not been defined yet.\n\nCONCLUSIONS\n\nThe challenges of the pharmaceutical industry connected with topical photoprotector formulations involve the photostability of organic filters, broadening the effectiveness spectrum and parameters, incorporating active ingredients, improving cosmetic and sensory aspects, individualizing vehicles, besides nanotechnology for vehiculation of actives and the use of substances that increase the effectiveness of actives, without increasing their concentration in the product (enhancers or boosters).\n\nFinally, the ideal photoprotector formulation should take into consideration aspects like efficiency for the proposed indication, scope of protection spectrum (UVA and UVB), safety and tolerability for topical use, stability, no staining of clothes, adequate cosmetics, pleasant fragrance, resistance to water, spread-ability, high extinction coefficient, substantivity*** and affordable cost.123-125,139,140\n\nPhotoprotector manipulation requires not only knowledge of pharmacotechnique, but also of regulation and market aspects. On the other hand, the dermatologist, as prescriber, has the role of evaluating the diverse products available in the market, indicating the most adequate for each situation. The magistral prescription for sunscreen lacks safety regarding information about the actual protection factor required and labeled, as it is unfeasible to determine the protection factor in the small amounts produced and the different compositions of actives used.\n\nCHAPTER 4B\n\nEVALUATION OF SAFETY AND EFFICACY OF SUNSCREEN\n\nNecessary safety requirements for ultraviolet filters\n\nBrazil has an official list of ingredients classified as ultraviolet filters, which are allowed for use in formulations.127 This list has as reference the European list of allowed ingredients for sunscreens.\n\nFor a molecule to be approved for topical use in a photoprotector, a safety dossier must be presented to ANVISA containing standardized topical and systemic toxicological studies, besides evaluation of cutaneous permeation, whose absence makes systemic effects impossible.\n\nFollows , with the required studies for safety evaluation of raw material to be used in sunscreens.156\n\nCHART 4\n\n1. Acute toxicity 2. Subchronic toxicity 3. Percutaneous absorption 4. Irritatio of mucous membranes or skin 5. Sensitization 6. Photoirritation, photosensitization 7. Mutagenicity 8. Photomutagenicity\n\nAny of the effects cited above may be demonstrated by toxicological tests. According to calculations, data base and complementary toxicological tests, dose/concentration and route of administration are then established.156 Thus the importance of toxicological studies of a cosmetic raw material before its use in formulations.\n\nAll of the substances on ANVISA's list of ingredients for sunscreens are free from systemic toxicity and carcinogenesis when used topically and in the recommended concentrations.\n\nEndocrine effects of sunscreens\n\nSchlumpf et al.157 published, in 2001, a scientific article with the title: \"Estrogenicidade in vivo e in vitro de filtros ultravioleta\", in which the authors evaluated the estrogenic potential of benzophenone-3 (B3), avobenzone (BMDM), 4-methylbenzylidene camphor (4-MBC), octyl methoxycinnamate (OMC), homosalate (HMS) and octyl dimethyl PABA filters, through in vitro readings and experiments in guinea pigs.\n\nIn vitro readings were made with culture of breast cancer cells. In this experiment, the authors observed estrogenic potential in all filters, except in avobenzone.\n\nIn the in vivo study, a slight increase of uterine weight (estrogenic action) was observed with oral use of benzophenone-3 filter and a moderate increase with filters 4-MBC and OMC. Filters avobenzone, octyl-PABA and homosalate did not affect uterine weight with oral use.\n\nWhen use was topical, the only filter that caused changes in uterine weight was 4-MBC.\n\nBased on the findings of Schlumpf et al., the Scientific Committee On Consumer Safety (SCCS) organized, in July of 2001, a panel of experts in toxicology to evaluate the real estrogenic potential of these ingredients and verify the need for changing permission regarding its use in photoprotective formulations.158\n\nThe conclusion of the Committee was that the organic filters evaluated and authorized for use in cosmetic formulations in the European Union did not present estrogenic effects that could pose risks to human health. The results obtained by Schlumpf in his study arose from the use of excessively elevated doses of active ingredients, topically or orally, unlike the usual exposition to the ingredients when in normal use conditions.\n\nThis way, these products were not prohibited in the European Union or anywhere else, being amply used in sunscreen formulations for many years.\n\nANVISA standardization: safety in sunscreens\n\nSunscreens are considered cosmetic according to Brazilian law (risk degree: 2), that is, with greater risk of interaction with human skin.127 Every product categorized as solar filter must obey a specific law that regulates labeling, FPS and UVA protection determination method.128 When a manufacturer applies for registration with ANVISA, he should send the studies and a draft of the product label for evaluation.\n\nTherefore, any product, regardless of the manufacturer or country of origin, must adapt itself to the norm of the law. If the product has any additional allegation (example: protection against invisible light, hypoallergenic, for oily skin, etc.) it must present evidence for that allegation.128,156\n\nANVISA recommends that some safety studies be developed to ensure greater safety for the consumer, like studies on photoirritation and photosensitization.156 The ingredients in sunscreens are developed seeking to reduce adverse reactions to a minimum, and when these occur, they must not be systemic but occur on the application site.\n\nAccording to Schauder and Ippen,159 the typical patients with adverse reaction to sunscreens are women with history of photodermatosis, such as polymorphous light eruption, for they are continuous users and on skin already inflamed, with altered cutaneous barrier. The most common type of described reaction is photosensitization.160\n\nNanotechnology in sunscreens\n\nNanotechnology in sunscreens allowed enhancement of product cosmetics, better transparency and spreadability, besides better stability when delivered in nanospheres.\n\nThe technical groups that regulate the use of this technology in countries such as the USA, European Union and Japan, which have been discussing nanotechnology in cosmetics, divide the safety concern in two big groups: nanovectorized ingredients, through nanocapsules, such as liposomes and nanospheres; and nanoparticles, which are the nanoparticulate active ingredient itself.161\n\nThe first ones have a toxicological profile identical to the molecule without the delivery system, and would not need complementary studies; regarding the nanoparticulate active ingredient, the particles which have been studied for sunscreens are titanium dioxide and zinc oxide.161\n\nNanoparticulate titanium dioxide and zinc oxide have been intensely studied and current evidences indicate that there is no substantially greater permeation of the skin than the active ingredient in its conventional form.162\n\nHowever, there seem to be risks in the inhalation of titanium dioxide, in manufacturing conditions, although not for the end user. In Brazil, some forums are being created in ANVISA to discuss the theme and to capacitate future national discussions on the subject.\n\nEVALUATION OF THE EFFICACY OF SUNSCREEN\n\nThe benefits of wearing sunscreens in the prevention and treatment of different conditions or dermatological diseases are already well established in the literature.\n\nIts most immediate and evident benefit is the prevention of sunburn, which, by the way, was the motivation behind the researchers in the beginning of the twentieth century to develop products capable of avoiding it, particularly for aquatic and leisure activities.163\n\nAs regards public health, on the other hand, the main benefit of the correct"
