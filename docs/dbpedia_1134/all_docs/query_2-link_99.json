The country is the soul of history and culture and includes nightlife, scenic beauty, white sandy beaches, inland waterways and lush green forests that are among one of the largest in the world.\n\nHistory\n\n[edit]\n\nBefore Columbus arrived in the Americas, the area now known as Brazil was home to people mainly of the Tupi and Guarani ethnic groups. Colonization by the Portuguese began late in the 16th century, with the extraction of valuable wood from the pau brasil tree, from which the country draws its name. Brazil was colonized and developed by the Portuguese and not the Spanish, who claimed much of the Americas. Eastern Brazil was a waypoint on the Cape Route between Europe and Asia. During Portuguese rule, some parts of Brazil formed a Dutch colony between 1630 and 1654. The Dutch founded several cities, such as Mauritsville, and many sugar cane plantations. The Dutch fought a grim jungle war with the Portuguese, and without the support of the Republic of their homeland due to a war with England, the Dutch surrendered to the Portuguese, though they did not officially recognize Portuguese rule, which led to an all-out war with Portugal off the coast of Portugal in 1656. In 1665 the Peace Treaty of The Hague was signed, Portugal lost its Asian colonies and had to pay 63 tons of gold to compensate the Dutch Republic for the loss of its colony.\n\nBrazil became the center of the Portuguese Empire by 1808, when the King Dom João VI (John VI) fled from Napoleon's invasion of Portugal and established himself and his government in the city of Rio de Janeiro.\n\nThe following four centuries saw continued exploitation of the country's natural resources such as gold and rubber, alongside the rise of an economy based largely on sugar, coffee and African slave labor. Christianizing and exploitation of natives continued, and the 19th and 20th centuries saw a second wave of immigration, mainly Portuguese, Italian, Spanish, German (in southern Brazil), Japanese, American (mainly in São Paulo State), Polish and Ukrainian (in the south), adding to the set of factors that generated today's complex and unique Brazilian culture and society.\n\nIndependence was a far less revolutionary undertaking in Brazil than in its Spanish-speaking neighbors. The Portuguese king Dom João VI fled along with the Portuguese royal family in 1808, when France under Napoleon Bonaparte invaded Portugal during the Napoleonic Wars.\n\nFrom 1815, Brazil started to have the same status as Portugal, ceasing to be a colony. The separation was gradual and supported by Prince Pedro, son of Dom João VI. Pedro initially stayed in Rio as provisional regent. Following the ideals of the leader of the independence movement in South America, Simón Bolívar, Pedro declared independence from Brazil on September 7, 1822 and was crowned Emperor Dom Pedro I. Six years later, in 1828, the province of Cisplatina became independent after a long war involving Argentina and Brazil, becoming what is now Uruguay.\n\nUntil 1889, Brazil was an Empire under the rule of Dom Pedro I and his son Dom Pedro II. By this time, it became an emerging international power. Slavery, which had initially been widespread, was restricted by successive legislation until its final abolition in 1888. Many factors contributed to the fall of the monarchy and the rise of nominal Republicanism thereafter, but, in effect, there was military intervention in Brazil after fall of the empire until 1894. Since then, democracy in Brazil was interrupted by coups and dictatorships until 1985, when a new civil and democratic government was elected and a new constitution was enacted three years later.\n\nBy far the largest, most populous and prosperous country in Latin America, it has emerged from more than two decades (1964-1985) of military dictatorship in the governance of the country to pursue democratic rule, while facing the challenges of continuing its industrial and agricultural growth and developing its interior. Exploiting vast natural resources, enormous geographic area, and a large labor pool, today Brazil is Latin America's leading economic power and a regional leader, overshadowing the likes of Mexico and Argentina. Political corruption, as in most of Latin America, and high barriers to entry of markets including labor, remain pressing problems. A consequence of this is high crime rates, especially in large cities.\n\nThe \"pink tide\" in Latin American politics has brought greater economic disparity in Brazil as in other countries, with political classes growing in wealth and number while poorly educated and politically poorly-connected people suffer from high barriers to entry into labor markets, higher education and other markets. Discontent with the Brazilian government erupted into open protests during the 2014 World Cup football tournament, and again during the 2016 Summer Olympics. Government forces had begun forcibly removing people from their homes before the tournaments began, and the response to the protests was brutal by most accounts. Some protesters pointed out the absurdity of building expensive stadiums in faraway places when people were living in slums with no property rights.\n\nWidespread discontent with the economy led to the election of far-right populist candidate Jair Bolsonaro as president in 2018. Bolsonaro has pledged to end environmental protections and roll back indigenous and minority rights in exchange for pursuing economic development, though how this will affect the country's human rights record and the lives of ordinary Brazilians remains to be seen.\n\nGeography\n\n[edit]\n\nWith a land area of 8,515,767 square kilometres (3,287,956 sq mi), Brazil is the world's fifth largest country. It is about the same size as the contiguous United States and half the size of Russia.\n\nBrazil's landscape is characterized by extensive tropical forests from the Amazon plain in the north to plateaus, hills and a mountainous coastline in the south and southeast. While the basis of the country's agriculture is in the savannas of the Midwest, most of the population lives near the Atlantic coast, where almost all major cities are also.\n\nThe Brazilian territory also has the archipelagos of São Pedro and São Paulo, about 800 km off the Brazilian coast, which have only one lighthouse built on them, and the former penal colony of Fernando de Noronha, which is not far from the rocky group. Both are on the Mid-Atlantic Ridge, in the equatorial Atlantic. The islands of Trindade and Martim Vaz, which belong to the state of Espírito Santo, are of volcanic origin. The oval-shaped Rocas Atoll spans several kilometers and has been listed as a UNESCO World Heritage Site for its exceptional wildlife.\n\nBut the largest island in Brazil is the Marajó Island, in the Amazon. It is the largest river island in the world and, with an area of ​​around 48,000 km² (18,532.90 square miles), is larger than Switzerland. However, as large parts are flooded in the rainy season, the island is populated only in a few places. Bananal Island is also one of the largest river islands in the world with an area of ​​approximately 20,000 km². It is located in a national park in the state of Tocantins on the Araguaia River and its size is similar to Jamaica.\n\nGovernment and politics\n\n[edit]\n\nBrazil is a federal republic, modeled after the American presidential system. The people directly elect a president who is both head of state and head of government. The president is elected for a four-year term, with the right to only one re-election.\n\nThe legislative branch is the National Congress, a bicameral parliament that consists of the Federal Senate and the Chamber of Deputies. Both houses are directly elected. Senate members are elected for 8-year terms, with renewal of one or two thirds every 4 years. Members of the Chamber of Deputies are elected every four years through the proportional representation of each state. The Supreme Federal Court, the Superior Court of Justice and other Superior Courts, the National Justice Council and the Regional Federal Courts form the judicial branch. The political system follows a multiparty system. The main political parties represented in National Congress are the Workers' Party, the Brazilian Democratic Movement, the Brazilian Social Democracy Party, the Social Democratic Party, the Liberal Party and the Brazil Union. It is common for many Brazilian politicians to switch parties frequently.\n\nOne of the main problems in Brazilian politics is corruption. Clientelism, nepotism, political favoritism and overpricing of public funds are common. In addition, the unrestricted multiparty system and the high number of parties make Brazilian politics highly fragmented, making the president needing support from alliances of several different parties in order to implement his governmental agenda (a phenomenon called coalition presidentialism).\n\nCulture\n\n[edit]\n\nOwing to Brazil’s continental dimensions, varied geography, history and people, the country’s culture is rich and diverse. It has several regional variations, and in spite of being mostly unified by a single language, some regions are so different from each other that they look like different countries altogether.\n\nMusic plays an important part in Brazilian identity. Styles like choro, samba and bossa nova are considered genuinely Brazilian. Caipira music is also in the roots of sertanejo, the national equivalent to country music. MPB stands for Brazilian Popular Music, which mixes several national styles under a single concept. Forró, a north-eastern happy dancing music style, has also become common nationwide. New urban styles include funk - a name given to a dance music genre from Rio's favelas that mixes heavy electronic beats and often raunchy rapping - and techno-brega, a crowd-pleaser in northern states, that fuses romantic pop, dance music and Caribbean rhythms.\n\nA mixture of martial arts, dance, music and game, capoeira was brought to Brazil by African slaves, mainly from Portuguese colonies Angola. Distinguished by vivacious complicated movements and accompanying music, it can be seen and practiced in many Brazilian cities. Later immigrants from Japan brought their traditional martial arts with them, which gradually evolved into a unique style known as Brazilian jiu-jitsu.\n\nIn classical music, the Modern Period is particularly notable, due to the works of composers like Heitor Villa-Lobos and Camargo Guarnieri, who created a typical Brazilian school, mixing elements of the traditional European classical music to the Brazilian rhythms, while other composers like Cláudio Santoro followed the guidelines of the Second School of Vienna. In the Romantic Period, the greatest name was Antonio Carlos Gomes, author of some Italian-styled operas with typical Brazilian themes, like Il Guarany and Lo Schiavo. In the Classical Period, the most prominent name is José Maurício Nunes Garcia, a priest who wrote both sacred and secular music and was very influenced by the Viennese classical style of the 18th and early 19th century.\n\nCandomblé and Umbanda are religions with African roots that have survived prejudice and persecution and still have a significant following in Brazil. Their places of cult are called terreiros and many are open to visit.\n\nIndigenous traits can be found everywhere in Brazilian culture, from cuisine to vocabulary. There are still many indigenous groups and tribes living in all Brazilian regions, although many have been deeply influenced by Western culture, and several of the country's surviving indigenous languages are in danger of disappearing completely. The traditional lifestyle and graphic expressions of the Wajãpi indigenous group from the state of Amapá were proclaimed a Masterpiece of the World's Intangible Heritage by UNESCO. The vast majority of the world's last uncontacted peoples reside within the dense Amazon rainforest of Brazil.\n\nGlobo, the largest national television network, also plays an important role in shaping the national identity. The other five major Brazilian TV networks are SBT (the second largest), RecordTV, Band, RedeTV and Cultura (the public and educational television network). There are also many other local or regional TV channels. In addition, Brazilians increasingly have access to many other cable or satellite TV channels. Nine out of ten households have a TV set, which is the most important source of information and entertainment for most Brazilians, followed by radio broadcasts. TVs broadcast sports, movies, local and national news and telenovelas (soap operas)– 6-10 month-long series that have become one of the country’s main cultural exports.\n\nPeople\n\n[edit]\n\nThroughout its history, Brazil has welcomed several different peoples and practices. Brazil constitutes a melting pot of the most diverse ethnic groups, somewhat mitigating ethnic prejudices and racial conflicts, though long-lasting slavery and even genocide among indigenous populations have taken their toll. Prejudice is generally more directed towards different social classes rather than between races. Nevertheless, race, denoted by skin colour, is still a dividing factor in Brazilian society and you will notice the skin typically darkens as the social class gets lower: wealthy upper-class people are mostly light skinned; most average middle-class people are tan; and the majority of poor people are black. Nowadays, however, Afro-Brazilians and Amerindian populations are increasingly aware of their civil rights and of their rich cultural heritage, and they can hope to achieve social mobility through education.\n\nIn general, Brazilians are a fun-loving people. While Southerners may be considered somewhat colder and more reserved, from Rio northward, people can boast a vivacious attitude and enjoy leisure time.\n\nFriendship and hospitality are highly prized among Brazilians, and both family connections and social interactions are valued highly. To people they have met, or at least know by name, Brazilians are usually very open, friendly and sometimes quite generous. Once introduced, until getting a good reason not to, a typical Brazilian may treat you as warmly as he would treat a best friend. Brazilians are reputedly one of the most hospitable people in the world and foreigners are usually treated with respect and often with true admiration. That being said, tourism in Brazil, as in most of the world, brings out the darker side of humanity.\n\nAttitudes towards foreigners may also be subject to regional differences:\n\nThe state of Santa Catarina welcomes their Spanish-speaking tourists with bilingual signs and welcome committees.\n\nIn Salvador, the largest city of the Northeast, anyone talking, acting or looking like a tourist (even other Brazilians!) could be charged higher prices, such as in parking lots, in restaurants, etc.\n\nMost Brazilians are honest and genuinely friendly, but many are used to small acts of corruption in their everyday lives, the so-called jeitinho brasileiro. If you obviously look like a tourist, you are a potential target; for instance, a vendor may try to sell goods at higher prices, or a taxi driver may choose the longest route to the destination. It doesn't mean that you can't trust anyone, just that you have to be a bit more alert and careful, particularly if someone seems too friendly.\n\nWhereas the \"Western\" roots of Brazilian culture are largely European, especially Iberian, as evidenced by its colonial towns and sporadic historical buildings between the newer skyscrapers, there has been a strong tendency to adopt a more \"American way of life\" which is found in urban culture and architecture, mass media, consumerism and a positive attitude toward technical progress. Despite this, Brazil is still a nation facing the Atlantic rather than Hispanic America, and the intellectual elites are likely to look up to Europe, especially France, as sources of inspiration, as opposed to the US. Many aspects in Brazilian society, such as the educational system, are inspired by the French, and may seem strange at first to North American visitors.\n\nThe contrasts in this large country equally fascinate and shock most visitors, especially Europeans. The indifference of many locals towards the social, economic and ecological problems can upset visitors accustomed to addressing these issues at home. While an elite of well-educated professionals and the political class partake in the amenities of modern society, child labor, illiteracy and grossly inferior housing still exist even in cities blessed by economic growth and huge foreign investment such as São Paulo or Rio.\n\nAs much as Brazilians acknowledge their self-sustainability in raw materials, agriculture, and energy sources as an enormous benefit for the future, most of them agree that without enormous changes in education and access to entrepreneurship for all, there will hardly be a way out of poverty and underdevelopment.\n\nSince the beginning of the 21st century, Brazil has faced an increasing wave of immigration from China, Bolivia and Haiti.\n\nClimate\n\n[edit]\n\nBrazil is a huge country with different climatic zones, although most of the country is in the tropics. Temperatures vary greatly depending on the altitude of the place you are and the distance from the equator. In the Amazon region, from northern Mato Grosso to western Maranhão, there is a tropical rainforest climate, with very frequent rains, high temperatures and a reduced thermal amplitude. There is an almost uninterrupted rainy season in the Amazon rainforest, with the main rainy months from November to March. In the Northeast, the coast has frequent rains in the winter.\n\nThe interior of the Brazilian Northeast has a semi-arid climate, where there are very high temperatures, rare rains and frequent droughts. The central areas of Brazil have a tropical savanna climate, with extremely dry winter, low humidity levels in the middle of the year (below 30%) and a hot and rainy summer.\n\nIn the southeast, the coast is hot and humid and suffers the direct action of the tropical Atlantic mass, with frequent rains in the summer. In the highest areas of the Southeast, with altitudes between 500m and 1000m or more, there are the lowest temperatures in the entire tropical area, reaching an average lower than 18º C. In the south of the state of São Paulo and in the three southern regions of the states of In Brazil, the climate is subtropical, with rains evenly distributed throughout the year. The summer is very hot and has an average temperature of 30º, whereas the winter, considered very cold, has frequent frosts and low temperatures, sometimes getting less than 0° C. In many cities of altitude over 1000m in Santa Catarina and north of the Serras Gaúchas region of Rio Grande do Sul, temperatures are even colder, even occurring snow.\n\nReligion\n\n[edit]\n\nBrazil is one of the world's most religiously diverse countries. Brazilians follow a variety of religious faiths and religious freedom is guaranteed by the constitution.\n\nChristianity is the largest religion in Brazil, with most Brazilians being followers of the Roman Catholic Church. Catholicism was introduced by the Portuguese in the 16th century and used to be Brazil's official state religion until the 19th century. A significant portion of Brazilians are Protestants; most Brazilian Protestants are followers of Pentecostalism and the number of Protestants has grown considerably over the past few decades.\n\nBuddhism was introduced to the country by Asian immigrants and Brazil has one of the largest Buddhist populations in the Americas. More than 250,000 Brazilians are adherents of Buddhism.\n\nJudaism came to the country during the 15th or 16th century. Brazil is home to one of the largest Jewish communities in the world and has the second largest Jewish community in South America. More than 120,000 Brazilians are adherents of Judaism.\n\nIslam is one of Brazil's largest minority religions. Islam is believed to have been introduced to the country by African slaves from West Africa.\n\nAfro-Brazilian religions, such as Umbanda and Candomblé, have many followers, syncretizing African deities (orixás) with Catholic saints. Spiritism is the third most followed religion in Brazil and the country has the largest number of Spiritists in the world.\n\nHolidays and working hours\n\n[edit]\n\nBrazil observes the following 13 national holidays:\n\nNew Year's Day - 1 January\n\nCarnaval - February/March (movable - 40 days before Easter. Monday and Tuesday are the actual holidays, but celebrations usually begin on Saturday and last until noon of Ash Wednesday, when shops and services re-open.)\n\nGood Friday - March/April (movable) two days before Easter Sunday\n\nTiradentes - 21 April\n\nLabour Day - 1 May\n\nCorpus Christi - May/June (movable) sixty days after Easter Sunday\n\nIndependence Day - 7 September\n\nDay of Our Lady of Aparecida (Patron Saint of Brazil) and Children's Day - 12 October\n\nDay of the Dead (Finados) - 2 November\n\nRepublic Proclamation Day - 15 November\n\nChristmas - 25 December\n\nWorking hours are usually from 08:00 or 09:00-17:00 or 18:00. Banks open Monday to Friday, from 10:00-16:00. Street shops tend to close at noon on Saturday and re-open on Monday. Shopping malls normally open from 10:00-22:00 or 23:00, Monday to Saturday, and from 15:00-21:00 on Sundays. Some malls, especially in large cities, are also open on Sundays, although not all the stores may be open. It is also possible to find 24-hour stores and small markets that are open on Sundays.\n\nTime zones\n\n[edit]\n\nBrazil spans four standard time zones from UTC-2 to UTC-5 (in Brazilian terms, \"Brasilia time -2\" to \"Brasilia time +1\").\n\nBrasilia time +1 (UTC-2): Fernando de Noronha and some other smaller islands in the Atlantic.\n\nBrasilia time (UTC-3): Southeast, South, Northeast, Goiás, Distrito Federal, Tocantins, Pará, Amapá.\n\nBrasilia time -1 (UTC-4): Roraima, eastern Amazonas, Rondônia, Mato Grosso and Mato Grosso do Sul.\n\nBrasilia time -2 (UTC-5): Acre and western Amazonas.\n\nSince 2019, daylight saving time is no longer observed in Brazil.\n\nVisitor information\n\n[edit]\n\nVisit Brazil website\n\nGet around\n\n[edit]\n\nTravelling between major cities in Brazil can take a lot of time.\n\nBy plane\n\n[edit]\n\nAir service covers most of Brazil. Many flights make many stops en route, particularly in hubs such as São Paulo, Rio de Janeiro or Brasilia. Some airports with regular passenger traffic are still operated by state-owned company Infraero, although many international airports already had their operation privatized.\n\nThere are now several Brazilian booking engines that are good (although not perfect) for comparing flights and prices between different companies. They will mostly include an extra fee, hence it is cheaper to book on the airline's own site.\n\nThe Brazilian airline scene changes surprisingly often. The largest Brazilian carriers are the flag carrier LATAM Airlines and low-cost airlines Gol and Azul. These airlines have flights that serve all capitals and major cities in the country. Azul's subsidiary Azul Conecta and VoePass offer short-haul flights to smaller regional airports throughout the country. There are also regional carriers.\n\nMany domestic flights have so many stops that some, including yours, may be missing from the listings in the airports. Double check your flight number and confirm with ground staff.\n\nCertain domestic flights in Brazil are \"international\", meaning that the flight has arrived from abroad and is continuing without clearing all passengers through customs and immigration. This means all passengers must do this at the next stop, even those having boarded in Brazil. Do not fill out a new immigration form, but show what you were given upon actual arrival to Brazil.\n\nBy car\n\n[edit]\n\nSee also: Driving in Brazil\n\nBrazil has the largest road network in Latin America with over 1.6 million kilometres. A car is a good idea if you want to explore scenic areas, e.g. the historic cities of Minas Gerais, the Rio-Santos highway, or the beaches in North-East Brazil. There are the usual car rental companies at the airports. Many roads are in good condition, especially in the east and south of the country and along the coast. In other areas and outside the metropolitan regions there are also gravel and dirt roads for which an off-road vehicle can be strongly recommended. This especially applies to the Amazon area where many roads are difficult or not at all passable during the rainy season from November to March. This is why it is advisable to travel with a good map and to be well informed about distances, road conditions and the estimated travel time. Road maps of the brand Guia Quatro Rodas was available in the most newsstands in Brazil until 2015, but they ceased to be published from that year. Many Brazilian drivers also tend to use online maps such as Google Maps and Waze to find the best routes. In theory, the driving rules of Brazil resemble those of Western Europe or North America. In practice, driving in Brazil can be quite scary if you are used to European (even Mediterranean) or North American road culture, due to widespread violations of driving rules, and the toleration thereof.\n\nDistances kept to other vehicles are kept at a bare minimum, overtaking whenever close to possible, and changing lanes without much of a prior signal. Many large cities also suffer from hold-ups when you wait at a red light in the night. Even if there is no risk of robbery, many drivers (including of city buses) run red lights or stop signs at night when they do not see incoming traffic from the cross street. Drivers also indulge in \"creative\" methods of saving time, such as using the reverse direction lanes. In rural areas, many domestic animals are left at the roadside, and they sometimes wanders into the traffic. Pedestrians take enormous chances crossing the road, since many drivers do not bother to slow down if they see pedestrians crossing. The quality of the paving is very varied, and the presence of enormous potholes is something that strongly discourages night-driving. Also consider the risk of highway hold-ups after dark, not to mention truck drivers on amphetamines (to keep awake for days in a row).\n\nIn Brazil cars are driven on the right hand side of the road.\n\nA flashing left signal means that the car ahead is warning you not to pass, for some reason. If the car ahead of you wants to show you that it is safe to pass it will flash the right signal. The right signal is the same signal to indicate that you're going to stop on the side of the road, so it means you're going to slow down. On the other hand the left signal is the same signal to indicate you're going to pass the car ahead, meaning you're going to speed up.\n\nFlashing, twinkling headlights from the cars coming on the opposite side of the road means caution on the road ahead. Most of the time, it indicates that there are animals, cops or speed radar ahead.\n\nKeep the doors locked when driving, especially in the larger cities, as robberies at stop signs and red lights are quite common in some areas. You'll make it much easier for the robber if he can simply open up the door and sit down. Be equally careful with keeping your windows wide open, as someone might put their hands inside your car and steal a wallet, for instance. Leave your handbags and valuables out of sight.\n\nBy bicycle\n\n[edit]\n\nIn smaller cities and towns the bicycle is a common means of transport. This does not mean that cyclists are usually respected by cars, trucks, or bus drivers. But you may find good roads with little traffic outside the cities. It is also easy to get a lift by a pickup or to have the bike transported by a long-distance bus. Cycling path are virtually non-existent in cities, except along certain beachfronts, such as Rio de Janeiro and Recife.\n\nThere are bicyclers groups around the country, e.g. Sampa Bikers in São Paulo which meets weekly.\n\nBy train\n\n[edit]\n\nBrazil's railway system was mostly wrecked during the military regimes. Today, few interstate passenger lines remain after the dismantling and scrapping of rail transport in Brazil. However, there are several urban or short-distance tourist lines between municipalities in the same state, mainly in the southern and southeastern states.\n\nFrom Belo Horizonte, Minas Gerais to Vitória, Espírito Santo - Daily trains operated by Vale leave Belo Horizonte at 07:30 and Cariacica (10 km of Vitória), at 07:00. Travel time is about 12½ hours. Seats are limited and it is not possible to reserve, so it is advisable to buy in advance at the Vale's website. The railway is the second longest passenger line of Brazil, almost 700 km long.\n\nFrom São Luis, Maranhão to Parauapebas, Pará - interesting because part of it passes through the Amazon rainforest and it's the longest passenger railway of Brazil, almost 900 km long. It is operated by Vale. The train leaves São Luís at 08:00 on Mondays, Thursdays and Saturdays. From Paraopebas, the train leaves at 06:00 on Tuesdays, Fridays and Sundays. 15 hours of travel.\n\nBy inter-city bus\n\n[edit]\n\nLong-distance buses are a convenient, economical, and rather comfortable way to travel between regions. Bus stations (Terminal Rodoviário, Estação Rodoviária or Rodoviária) in Brazilian cities play a role akin to train stations in many countries. You should check travel distance and time while traveling within Brazil; going from Rio de Janeiro to the south region could take more than 24 hours, so it may be worth going by plane if you can afford it.\n\nBrazil has a very good long-distance bus network. Basically, any city with more than 100,000 people will have direct lines to the closest state capitals and also to other major cities within the same range. If there is no bus station in a city, there may be some form of public transport (a bus, probably) to a bus station of a city nearby.\n\nSometimes you may need to go to the bus station in person to buy a ticket, although today the big bus companies make reservations and sell tickets online, as long as you get your ticket in advance. In some cities, you can also buy a ticket over the phone and receive it at the hotel for an extra fee of R$3 to R$5. Some companies have also adopted the ingenious pricing policy of airlines: in some cases, buy with advance can save more than 50%. The ease of flagging a bus and getting on it (if there are no seats available, you will have to stand, still paying full price) is common in the country. This is less likely to work along a few routes where armed robberies have happened frequently, such as those leading to the border with Paraguay and to Foz do Iguaçu.\n\nNo bus company serves the whole country, so you must identify the company that connect two cities. Buser and National Land Transport Agency[dead link] website can be a quick way to find bus tickets to many Brazilian cities. Another possibility is to call the bus station of one city. Flixbus serves the country and has rides in every part of Brazil except in the area of the Amazon river\n\nBus services are often sold in three classes: Regular, Executive and First-Class (Leito, in Portuguese). Regular may or may not have air conditioning. For long distances or overnight travels, Executive offers more space and a folding board to support your legs. First-Class has even more space and only three seats per row, making enough space to sleep comfortably. All trips of more than 4 hours are covered by buses with bathrooms and the buses stop for food/bathrooms at least once every 4 hours of travel.\n\nSome big cities like São Paulo and Rio have more than one bus station, each one covering certain cities around. It is good to check in advance to which bus station you are going.\n\nBus stations in some Brazilian cities tend to be located far from downtown areas. They can be in quite remote neighborhoods, so if you travel at night, be prepared to take a taxi to and from the station. There will also be local bus lines. Even if you have a valid ticket purchased elsewhere, some Brazilian bus stations may also require a boarding pass. This can be obtained from the bus company, usually for an additional fee. If you buy a ticket at the departure bus station, you will also receive this boarding pass.\n\nIn Brazil, bus stations can include many services, including fast-food restaurants, cafes, internet cafes, restrooms and left-luggage office. As a general rule, the bigger the city, the more expensive the services can be (for example, leaving a suitcase as luggage in a smaller city can cost R$1, but in a capital like Recife it can cost R$5).\n\nAs required by Brazilian federal law, when buying tickets, as well as boarding the bus, an identification document may be requested (which for a foreigner means your passport). Not all drivers can read foreign passports, so be prepared to show them that the passport name really is the same as the ticket name.\n\nBy ride sharing\n\n[edit]\n\nMany people offer shared rides between many popular destinations. The most notable website for finding rides is BlaBlaCar, which also has a rating system for drivers, making the trip very secure, especially for Brazilian standards. This way, you can easily bring down your transport costs by 40-50%. Costs are about R$20 per 100 km.\n\nAlso, it can be considerably faster, without unnecessary stops at restaurants and such. The BlaBlaCar website is free, and you only pay the driver directly. But they will almost certainly charge in the future like they do for other countries as well. But until the taxation status of such services (including Uber) is settled by the government, the free system will not change.\n\nIf you would like to see the price of the shared ride in the app in reais, you need to select BRL (Brazilian real) after installing the app. If you have the app on your smartphone already in another currency, you need to delete the app and reinstall it.\n\nDo not underestimate the desire of Brazilians to discuss and talk about everything, and to give their opinions about even the most remote nonsense. This can be highly stressful if you have a different temperament, prefer a quiet drive, and just want to reach your destination.\n\nBy city bus\n\n[edit]\n\nMost cities have extensive bus services. Multiple companies may serve a single city. There is almost never a map of the bus lines, and often bus stops are unmarked. Be prepared for confusion and wasted time. The bus schedule for the urban passenger transport service in large and small cities can be consulted on the site, in addition to Google Maps, it includes some services.\n\nBuses have a board behind the windshield that advertises the main destinations they serve. You may have to ask the locals for information, but they may not know bus lines except the ones they usually take.\n\nIn most cities you have to wave to stop the bus when you want to take it. This in itself would not pose a problem; however, in big cities there may be dozens of bus lines stopping at a given bus stop and bus stops are not designed to accommodate so many vehicles. Frequently one cannot observe the oncoming buses due to other buses blocking the view. Bus drivers are reluctant to slow down for a bus stop if they are not sure someone will take their bus, so it is common to miss your bus because you could not see it coming to wave on time or the driver did not see you waving in between buses already at the stop. Some people go into the middle of a busy street to wait for their bus to make sure they see it and the driver sees them. In some places, like Manaus, drivers even tend to ignore stop requests (both to get on and to get off) if it is not too easy to navigate to the bus stop.\n\nMost city buses have both a driver and a conductor. The conductor sits behind a till next to a turnstile. You have to pay the conductor; the price of the bus is usually advertised on the windshield. The turnstiles are narrow, and very inconvenient if one carries any kind of load (try balancing a heavy backpack over the turnstile while the bus is running). Larger buses often have a front section, before the turnstile, meant in priority for the elderly, handicapped and pregnant women - you can use it but you still have to pay! Typical prices are around R$3.\n\nYou can try asking the conductor to warn you when the bus is close to your destination. Depending on whether he or she understands you and feels like helping you, you may get help.\n\nIn addition to large city buses, there are often minibuses or minivans (alternativo). You pay the driver when you go aboard.\n\nBy boat\n\n[edit]\n\nIn northern Brazil, it is possible to travel many distances by boat. In fact, the boat is the main and most accessible means of transport to get around the Amazon, since the Amazon Forest is cut by many rivers and some cities are inaccessible by road. The best boat services in the country are in the Amazon, where you can ride on speedboats and comfortable yachts or small wooden boats. The main navigable rivers are the Amazon River, the Araguaia River, the Xingu River and the Tapajós River. It is necessary to know the geography of the region, as in some places waterfalls are formed.\n\nBy e-hailing\n\n[edit]\n\nBrazil has availability of some e-hailing services, Uber being the largest of them. Notable e-hailing services in Brazil, are:\n\nTalk\n\n[edit]\n\nSee also: Brazilian Portuguese phrasebook\n\nNon-verbal communication\n\nBrazilians use a lot of gestures in informal communication, and the meaning of certain words or expressions may be influenced by them.\n\nThe thumbs up gesture is used to mean everything's OK, yes or even thanks. Avoid using the OK hand gesture for these meanings, as it can be considered obscene.\n\nWagging your extended index finger back and forth and/or clicking your tongue behind your teeth two or three times means no\n\nUsing your index finger to pull down one of your lower eyelids means watch out.\n\nStroking your two biggest fingers with your thumb is a way of saying that something is expensive.\n\nSnapping a few times means fast or a long time (ago).\n\nStroking your lips and then snapping means delicious; pinching your earlobe means the same in some regions.\n\nMaking a fist with your thumb between the index and middle finger, known as the figa, is a sign of good or bad luck depending on the region.\n\nTouching the palm with the thumb and making a circular movement with the hand means I am being robbed/ripped off/ in some regions.\n\nThe hush gesture is considered extremely impolite, about the same as shouting \"shut up!\" to someone.\n\nAn informal way to get someone's attention, similar to a whistle, is a hissing sound: \"pssiu!\" It is not perceived as impolite, but gets really annoying if repeated too often.\n\nThe official language of Brazil is Portuguese.\n\nBrazilian Portuguese is remarkably different from European Portuguese. For instance, there are a number of pronunciation differences, some words are written differently, some words have a completely different meaning in Brazil, and there are numerous loanwords from English, French, German, Italian, and Japanese.\n\nAlthough most Brazilians learn English at school, the focus is entirely on formal writing and grammar rather than actual conversation. Thus, many Brazilians are not that proficient in the language. You might find an English speaker in a major hotel or an area populated by tourists. Younger Brazilians are more likely to speak English. If you wish to travel to Brazil independently, you should have a solid knowledge of Brazilian Portuguese.\n\nSpanish speakers are usually able to get by in Brazil, especially towards the south, due to the proximity of the states of that region to Uruguay and Argentina and due to the tourists from those countries who visit the states of that region. While written Portuguese can be quite similar to Spanish, spoken Portuguese differs considerably and is much harder to understand. Compare the number 20 which is veinte (BAYN-teh) in Spanish to vinte (VEEN-chee) in Brazilian Portuguese. Even more different is gente (people), pronounced \"HEN-teh\" in Spanish and \"ZHEN-chee\" in Brazilian Portuguese. The letters CH, D, G, J, R, RR, and T are particularly difficult for Spanish speakers to understand, and that's without even considering the vowels. Often confusing to Spanish, even English speakers, is the pronunciation of the letter \"R\" in the beginning of most words. Common first names such as Roberto, Ronaldo and Rolando are not pronounced as you would think: the \"R\" is pronounced as \"H\". Thus you would say Hobertoo, Honawdoo and Holandoo. Rio is pronounced \"HEE-oo\".\n\nOther minority languages are spoken in some parts of Brazil. In the Amazon, several indigenous languages are still spoken, mainly Nheengatu, Tukano, and Baniwa, all of which have a co-official status in the municipality of São Gabriel da Cachoeira, in Amazonas. In the south, in cities that have received German and Italian immigrants, these languages and their dialects are also spoken by a small portion of the population, as in Pomerode, Santa Catarina, which has German and the Pomeranian dialect with co-official status and in Serafina Corrêa and Caxias do Sul, municipalities in Rio Grande do Sul, where the co-official language is Talian, a dialect of the Venetian language spoken in northern Italy. Due to immigration, it is becoming more common in some cities to find speakers of other foreign languages, such as Italian, Japanese, Mandarin Chinese, Korean, Arabic, Polish, Ukrainian, French and Haitian Creole.\n\nThe primary language of the Brazilian deaf community is Brazilian Sign Language (BSL), known locally as LIBRAS. When an interpreter is present in public, he or she will use BSL. It is influenced by French Sign Language (LSF) and also uses a one-handed manual alphabet very similar to that of LSF. Users of British Sign Language, Auslan, or New Zealand Sign Language, however, will have great difficulty understanding it. Those languages differ markedly in vocabulary and syntax from LSF, and also use a two-handed manual alphabet.\n\nVirtually all movies, in addition to foreign shows broadcast on Brazilian TV channels are dubbed into Portuguese. However, some pay TV channels have dual-audio (original audio with subtitles as an option available to be turned on by the user). If you want to watch the latest movies in English, not dubbed into Portuguese, you may be able to see them in some theaters in the capitals and biggest cities. Look for the Portuguese word \"Legendado\" (original with subtitles). You are unlikely to find films shown in their original language without subtitles.\n\nDrink\n\n[edit]\n\nAlcohol\n\n[edit]\n\nBrazil's national booze is cachaça (cah-shah-sah, also known as aguardente (\"burning water\") and pinga), a 40% sugar-cane liquor known to knock the unwary out quite quickly. It can be tried in virtually every bar in the country. Famous producing regions include Minas Gerais, where there are tours of distilleries, and the city of Paraty. Pirassununga is home to Caninha 51, Brazil's best-selling brand. Outside Fortaleza there is a cachaça museum (Museu da Cachaça) where you can learn about the history of the Ypioca brand.\n\nDrinking cachaça straight, or stirring in only a dollop of honey or a bit of lime juice, is a common habit on the Northeast region of the country, but the strength of cachaça can be hidden in cocktails like the famous caipirinha, where it is mixed with sugar, lime juice and ice. Using vodka instead of cachaça is nicknamed caipiroska or caipivodka; with white rum, it's a caipiríssima; and with sake it's a caipisaque or saquerinha (not in every region). Another interesting concoction is called capeta (\"devil\"), made with cachaça, condensed milk, cinnamon, guarana powder (a mild stimulant), and other ingredients, varying by region. If you enjoy fine brandy or grappa, try an aged cachaça. Deep and complex, this golden-coloured spirit is nothing like the ubiquitous clear liquor more commonly seen. A fun trip is to an \"alambique\" - a local distillery, of which there are thousands throughout the country - not only will you be able to see how the spirit is made from the raw cane sugar, you will probably also get a better price.\n\nWell worth a try is Brazilian whisky! It's actually 50% imported scotch - the malt component -and approximately 50% Brazilian grain spirit. Don't be misled by American sounding names like \"Wall Street\". It is not bourbon. Good value for money and indistinguishable from common British blends.\n\nWhile imported alcohol is very expensive, many international brands are produced under license in Brazil, making them widely available, and fairly cheap. You can buy booze in the tax-free after landing at Brazilian airports, but it generally is more expensive than buying it outside the airports.\n\nBeer\n\n[edit]\n\nBeer in Brazil has a respectable history because of the German immigrants. Most Brazilian beer brands tend to be way less thick and bitter than German, Danish or English beer. More than 90% of all beer consumed in Brazil is Pilsner, and it is usually drunk very cold (at a temperature close to 0°C). The most popular domestic brands are Brahma, Antarctica, and Skol. Traditional brands include Bohemia, Caracu (a stout), Original and Serra Malte (another stout). They are easily found in bars and are worth trying but are usually more expensive than the popular beers. There are also some national premium beers that are found only in some specific bars and supermarkets; if you want to taste a good Brazilian beer, search for Baden Baden, Colorado, Eisenbahn, Petra, Theresopolis and others. There are also some international beers produced by national breweries like Heineken and Stella Artois and have a slightly different taste if compared with the original beers.\n\nThere are two ways of drinking beer in bars: draft or bottled beer. Draft lager beer is called chope or chopp ('SHOH-pee'), and is commonly served with one inch of foam, but you can make a complaint to the bartender if the foam is consistently thicker than that. In bars, the waiter will usually collect the empty glasses and bottles on a table and replace them with full ones, until you ask him to stop, in a \"tap\" charging system. In the case of bottled beer, bottles (600ml or 1l) are shared among everyone at the table and poured in small glasses, rather than drunk straight from the bottle. Brazilians like their beer nearly ice-cold - hence, to keep the temperature down, bottles of beer are often kept in an insulated polystyrene container on the table.\n\nWine\n\n[edit]\n\nRio Grande do Sul is the leading wine production region. There are a number of wine-producing farms that are open to visitors and wine tasting, and wine cellars selling wine and fermented grape juice. One of these farms open to visitors is Salton Winery, located in the city of Bento Gonçalves. The São Francisco Valley, along the border of the states of Pernambuco and Bahia, is the country's newest wine-producing region. Brazilian wines are usually fresher, fruitier and less alcoholic than, for instance, French wines. Popular brands like Sangue de Boi, Canção and Santa Felicidade and others with prices below R$6.00 are usually seen as trash.\n\nIn Minas Gerais, look for licor de jabuticaba (jabuticaba liquor) or vinho de jabuticaba (jabuticaba wine), an exquisite purple-black beverage with a sweet taste. Jabuticaba is the name of a small grape-like black fruit native to Brazil.\n\nCoffee and tea\n\n[edit]\n\nBrazil is known world-wide for its high-quality strong coffee. Café is so popular that it can name meals (just like rice does in China, Japan and Korea): breakfast in Brazil is called café da manhã (morning coffee), while café com pão (coffee with bread) or café da tarde (afternoon coffee) means a light afternoon meal. Cafezinho (small coffee) is a small cup of strong, sweetened coffee usually served after meals in restaurants (sometimes for free, just ask politely). Bottled filtered coffee is being replaced by stronger espresso cups in more upscale restaurants.\n\nChá, or tea in Portuguese, is most commonly found in its Assam version (orange, light coloured). Some more specialised tea shops and cafés will have Earl Gray and green tea available as well.\n\nMate is an infusion similar to tea that is very high in caffeine content. A toasted version, often served chilled, is consumed all around the country, while Chimarrão (incidentally called mate in neighbouring Spanish-speaking countries) is the hot, bitter equivalent that can be found in the south and is highly appreciated by the gaúchos (Rio Grande do Sul dwellers). Tererê is a cold version of Chimarrão, common in Mato Grosso do Sul and Mato Grosso state.\n\nSoft drinks\n\n[edit]\n\nIf you want a Coke in Brazil, ask for coca or coca-cola, as \"cola\" means \"glue\" in Portuguese.\n\nGuaraná is a carbonated soft drink made from the guaraná berry, native to the Amazon area. The major brands are Antarctica and Kuat, the latter owned by Coke. Pureza is a lesser known guaraná soft drink specially popular in Santa Catarina. Other local guaraná brands are Fruki, very popular in Rio Grande do Sul, and Dolly, popular in São Paulo. There is also a Guaraná Jesus, a sweet pink soft drink that is popular in Maranhão. Almost all regions in Brazil feature their own local variants on guaraná, some which can be quite different from the standard \"Antarctica\" in both good and bad ways. If traveling to Amazonas, be sure to try a cold \"Baré,\" which due to its huge popularity in Manaus was purchased by Antarctica and is becoming more available throughout northern Brazil.\n\nTubaína is a carbonated soft drink once very popular among Brazilians (particularly the ones born in the 70s, 80s and early 90s) and becoming extremely hard to find. It was once mass-produced by \"Brahma\" before it became focused on beers only. If you happen to find a place that sells it, try it.\n\nMineirinho (or Mate Couro) is also a popular soft drink made of guaraná and a typical Brazilian leaf called Chapéu de Couro. Although most Brazilians say that it tastes like grass, older people (+70 years) claim that the drink has medicinal properties.\n\nFruit juices\n\n[edit]\n\nFruit juices are very popular in Brazil. Some cities, notably Rio de Janeiro, have fruit juice bars at nearly every corner.\n\nNothing beats coconut water (água de coco) on a hot day. (Stress the first o, otherwise it will come out as \"poo\" (cocô)). It is mostly sold as coco gelado in the coconut itself, drunk with a straw. Ask the machete-wielding vendors to cut the coconut in half so that you can eat the flesh after drinking the water.\n\nAçai (a fruit from the Amazon) is delicious and nutritious (rich in antioxidants) and can be found widespread across the nations. In the Amazon region it's used as a complement to the everyday diet, often eaten together with rice and fish in the main meal of the day. Curiously, outside of the Amazon region, it's typically used in blended in combination with guarana (a stimulant) powder and a banana to re-energize from late-night partying. It is served cold and has a consistency of soft ice. There are also açai ice creams available.\n\nMaracuja (passion fruit) (careful during an active day as this has a relaxant effect)\n\nCaju (cashew fruit) and\n\nGarapa or caldo de cana: freshly pressed sugarcane juice\n\nManga (mango) are also great juice experiences.\n\nMangaba\n\nUmbu\n\nVitamina: milk shake with fresh fruits\n\nBrazilians have great taste when it comes to mixing juices.\n\nSleep\n\n[edit]\n\nHigh season in Brazil follows the school holidays calendar, December and January (summer) being the busiest months. New Year, Carnival (movable between February and March, see Understand above) and Holy week are the peak periods, and prices can skyrocket, especially in coastal cities like Rio and Salvador. Also, during those holidays, many hotels restrict bookings to a 3 or 4-day minimum and charge in advance.\n\nHotels are plentiful in just about all areas of Brazil and can range from luxury beach resorts to very modest and inexpensive choices. The Brazilian tourism regulation board imposes specific minimum attributes for each type of facility, but as the 1-5 star rating is no longer enforced, check in advance if your hotel provides the kind of services you expect.\n\nPousada means guesthouse (the local equivalent of a French auberge or a British boarding house), and are usually simpler than hotels, and will offer fewer services (room service, laundry etc.). Pousadas are even more widespread than hotels.\n\nIn wilderness areas like the Pantanal, travelers usually stay in fazendas, which are ranches with guest facilities. In small towns of Minas Gerais people are fond of hotéis-fazenda (farm hotels) where you can swim, ride, walk, play football, and camp as well as sleep in picturesque barracks.\n\nAlso there is great fun in going on a boat hotel which will take you to inaccessible places on the rivers and lakes for great fishing trips or for simply relaxing and watching and photographing the wildlife which is very abundant in the Pantanal. The boats are large, safe, and comfortable with air-conditioned rooms (very necessary). Several small aluminum boats with outboard motor, carried by the boat hotel, driven by experienced fisher/guide will take 2 or 3 tourists to the best \"points\".\n\nYouth hostels (albergues da juventude) are becoming increasingly common.\n\nMany ho(s)tels give discounts if you do not use the monopolistic reservation website in the middle, especially in Rio. So, checkout their website directly or drop them a message.\n\nMotels vs hotels\n\n[edit]\n\nA quick word of caution; in Brazil a \"motel\" is not the same as what one normally finds in the United States. The term motel in Latin America usually refers to a place of accommodation where the rooms are rented on a short term basis, typically for romantic assignations, very similarly to a Japanese love hotel. Hotels, by contrast, are places of accommodation for travelers and are typically family friendly. Many hotels will not permit persons who are not registered as guests to go beyond the reception area. This is for the safety of both the guests and hotel staff and also to protect the hotel's reputation in what is still a culturally conservative and Catholic country. So visitors looking for a place to enjoy the physical company of another, will often use motels. Also privacy is something of a premium in Brazil, with children often living at home until they are married. For this and other practical reasons, couples, even married couples desiring a little intimacy, sometimes rent a room at a motel. These motels are common in Brazil and do not carry the social stigma that used to be associated with so called \"no tell motels\" in the United States or Canada. The quality and price of motel accommodations varies, sometimes drastically, with most being clean and well kept. Rooms are engaged anonymously with the tariff and any associated charges usually being paid on a cash only basis.\n\nWork\n\n[edit]\n\nBrazil is known for its very welcoming stance towards immigrants. Many people from South American countries live and work in Brazil and there is an abundance of work opportunities in the country.\n\nWith an unemployment rate of 7.5% (as of December 2023), finding a job in Brazil can be a competitive affair. A decent knowledge of Portuguese will enhance your employment prospects in Brazil and put you ahead of most people applying for jobs in the country.\n\nTo work in the country, you must have a work permit (Autorização de Trabalho) from the Ministry of Labor. To obtain it, you must be sponsored by an employer before entering the country. The process of hiring non-Brazilians can be a pretty complex task; employers are required, by law, to prove your skills to the government and simultaneously hire and train a replacement for you.\n\nIf you are a native English speaker, you may be able to find an English-teaching part-time job, but don't expect that to save your holidays. Although working in the informal market can seem hassle-free at first, there are risks as well. The pay will be under-the-table without contract, so it will be difficult for you to claim your labor rights later. In the bigger cities, there is also the danger of being turned in to the authorities by a rival school, which may see you to a plane home earlier than you had planned.\n\nThere is also a growing demand for Spanish language classes, so native Spanish speakers should have no trouble finding work, especially in the major cities. In both cases, it's always much more lucrative to find work privately rather than through schools. This can be done easily, for example by putting an ad in the classifieds section of the newspapers Folha de S. Paulo and Estado de S. Paulo (in São Paulo), O Globo (in Rio de Janeiro) and Zero Hora (in Porto Alegre) or in the Veja national weekly news magazine (you have to pay for it) or by putting up signs on the notice boards at universities like USP (free of charge).\n\nRefer to the Ministry of Labour website[dead link] for more detailed information.\n\nVolunteering\n\n[edit]\n\nWorking as a volunteer, learning Spanish and seeing the country on a shoestring is popular with many travellers in South America. Mostly people with lot of time opt for this kind of travelling, getting to know the country and its people.\n\nVolunteering can be done as part of a large organisation, or for local families. When working with or for local families, they often provide you with food and accommodation for about 3-5 hr work per day. Such engagements can be found with any of the following websites, which differ by length and type of stay: Workaway, HelpX, Wwoof, and Worldpackers. The website generally demand a small commission or a yearly fee.\n\nUse the rating system of these websites to determine good and reliable hosts. And beware, many locals just use those websites to find cheap labour, offering a terrible experience, sometimes no food or no decent accommodation. Avoid such offers, which are just badly managed businesses, and opt for placements that really depend on volunteers (like green farming, education, NGOs, etc.).\n\nIn general, avoid paying for volunteering. You can also contact a bunch of international NGOs and let them know you are interested in working for them. Sometimes you can also get a paid job after doing some volunteer work. Just be clear that you are able to stay a fixed amount of time for unpaid work, and that you would need some money to continue your work.\n\nStay healthy\n\n[edit]\n\nWhen visiting the Midwestern states of Brazil, the relative humidity can be below 30% during the dry season from June to September. It is important to drink plenty of water to avoid the unpleasant effects of dehydration.\n\nFood from street and beach vendors has a bad hygienic reputation in Brazil. The later in the day, the worse it gets. Bottled and canned drinks are safe, although some people will insist on using a straw to avoid contact with the exterior of the container. Bear in mind the heat and humidity when storing perishable foods.\n\nTap water varies from place to place, (from contaminated, saline or soaked with chlorine to plain drinkable) and Brazilians themselves usually prefer to have it filtered.\n\nIn airports, bus stations, as well as many of the cheaper hotels and malls, it is common to find drinking fountains (bebedouro), although not always safe. In hostel kitchens, look for the tap with the cylindrical filter attached. In more expensive hotels, there is often no publicly accessible fountain, and bedrooms contain minibars, selling you mineral water at extremely inflated prices — buying bottled water from the store is always the best alternative.\n\nVaccination against yellow fever and taking anti-malaria medication may be necessary if you are travelling to Midwestern state of Mato Grosso or northern (Amazon) regions. If you're arriving from Peru, Colombia or Bolivia, proof of yellow fever vaccination is required before you enter Brazil. Some countries, such as Australia and South Africa, will require evidence of yellow fever vaccination before allowing you enter the country if you have been in any part of Brazil within the previous week. Check the requirements of any country you will travel to from Brazil. In coastal Brazil there's also a risk for dengue fever, and the Zika virus outbreak in Latin America hit Brazil hard with more than 60,000 confirmed cases in 2015 and 2016.\n\nBeware that air conditioning in airports, intercity buses etc. is often quite strong. Carry a long-sleeved garment for air-conditioned places.\n\nAlthough Brazil is widely known as a country where sex is freely available, it is sometimes misunderstood regarding HIV. Brazil has one of the best HIV prevention programs and consequently, a very low infection rate compared with most countries. Condoms are highly encouraged by governmental campaigns during Carnaval, and distributed for free by local public medical departments.\n\nHealthcare\n\n[edit]\n\nBrazil has both a public tax-funded health care system similar to the NHS in the United Kingdom (Sistema Único de Saúde, known by its acronym in Portuguese, SUS) and a large private health care system. Public hospitals tend to be crowded and terrible, but they attend any kind of person, including foreigners. Most cities of at least 60,000 inhabitants have good private health care. Treatment in private hospitals is expensive. When travelling to Brazil, you should take out comprehensive travel insurance. The level and availability of care varies from region to region, but in general, care in private clinics is of a good standard. On the free public side, waiting times can be long, so access to private medical care is quicker. Public health care is available to tourists in emergencies, but after emergency treatment, care is usually transferred to the private sector. Adequate care may not be available outside urban areas.\n\nIn cases of acute serious illness, call an ambulance on emergency number 192 or 190 (Servico de Atendimento Móvel de Urgência, SAMU), but you must speak Portuguese. The ambulance will take the patient to the public hospital emergency department (Emergência), where a doctor will assess the need for transfer to the intensive care unit. If the patient has travel insurance or can pay for the treatment, he or she will be transferred to a private hospital.\n\nIf you have a minor illness, you can go to the nearest municipal emergency department, the UPA (Unidade de Pronto Atendimento), or to a private hospital. In large cities, there are first aid stations open 24 hours a day.\n\nRecommended hospitals for foreigners include:\n\nBrasília: Hospital Sírio-Libanês and Hospital Brasília.\n\nSão Paulo: Hospital Israelita Albert Einstein, Hospital Sírio Libanês and Hospital Alemão Oswaldo Cruz\n\nRio de Janeiro: Hospital Copa D`Or (Copacabana) and Hospital Samaritano (Botafogo)\n\nPorto Alegre: Hospital de Clínicas and Santa Casa Hospital Complex\n\nIn the private health sector, you can obtain services either through travel insurance, Brazilian health insurance or by paying by card or cash. On the private side, you must agree in advance whether you will pay for treatment through insurance, cash or a guarantee cheque. Some places only accept cash payment.\n\nDental services are cheaper than in western countries. In general, the quality of their work is good, especially in the big cities, but ask a local for advice and a recommendation.\n\nPharmacies are plentiful, offer a wide range of medicines and depending on the city, can be open 24/7. Certain medicines (e.g. antibiotics) can only be obtained with a valid prescription. Some medicines can be bought without a prescription. Not all medicines sold in Finland may be available.\n\nLarger pharmacies also offer services such as COVID testing."
