        "text": "Today I will take you with me once more to my home State, Bahia. A mosaic of options when the subject is tourism. There you can spend relaxing days on the white sandy and peaceful beaches, dance during a week on the street carnival, go visiting historical cities or tracking between endless valleys, as in the destination we go to explore now. Are you ready?\n\nChapada Diamantina is a macro region of Bahia that represents around 7% of the state. Altogether there are about 32,000 km2, within this area there is the Chapada Diamantina National Park with only 1,530 km2. Its history was marked by the panning for precious materials. For many years the main labor used for the garimpo was the slave one, and there are documents dated 1922 that still sign letters of manumission. The first report of diamond discovery was in 1830 in Mucugê, considered the oldest town of the track, which lies 150km from Lençóis. There was reported the work of up to 20 thousand men.\n\nAnother important village is Lençóis, which in the past was very privileged by the amount of diamonds found on its area. Not to mention that, between the 80’s and 90’s, tourism began to emerge as the main source of income of the city and, so to this day, it stands out among travelers. This was also our base during our last trip around this park.\n\nHOW TO ARRIVE IN CHAPADA DIAMANTINA\n\nConsidering that you are already in Brazil, there are 3 ways to get there:\n\n— Flight from Salvador to Lençóis: there are 3 directly flights per week and in 1 hour you are there;\n\n— By car. From Salvador for example you need close to 6 hours to reach Lençóis. In many parts of the path you need to be patient with so many trucks in front of you and not enough space to overtake. But, I did it 2 times and I also love road trips!\n\n— By bus. If you don’t want to hire a car, or don’t feel safe to drive in the Brazilian highways, you can easily take a bus in the Main Terminal in Salvador or another city of the country. The travel from Salvador takes around 6h30, the bus has an air con and departures 3 times per day. I would suggest you to take the one in the night, so you can sleep during traveling, save the hotel and arrive in Lençóis to enjoy the total day ahead. Tickets start on R$89 (in euro it would be around 20,00.\n\nWHERE TO STAY\n\nThis is a difficult question to answer. It will depend on your budget, number of days you have to explore the park, what exactly do you wanna do.\n\nAs Lençóis is the easiest city to reach (considering you can even arrive with the plane), and they have a good touristic structure, including hotels, hostels, tour agencies, pharmacies, mini markets, restaurants I would say it’s a great choice if this is your first time and you don’t have as much time. From there you can do some basic tracks and start to fall in love for this place! Click here to check the options. For all the ones I have been in, Hotel de Lençóis was the best. I’ve been also in the Casa da Geléia. The rooms, the food, the owners, the price… Everything was good!\n\nMany people also love to stay in Mucugê. It’s another simple village, with 2 main streets, colorful houses, a main square and the Guide Association, where you can book your tour around the park. I recommend the Pousada Monte Azul. But you can also check others here.\n\nIf you instead have plenty of time and will do a big tour around the Chapada, I would truly suggest you to organize your stay with your guide. He will be able to plan in the best way your locations, provide a place on locals houses also in case you don’t want to sleep on the tents and be your right hand over there. Please contact Luís Célio from the @zyonaventuras and trust on his suggestions. He is an amazing person and knows all about the place!\n\nWHAT TO BRING WITH YOU\n\nAs you are going to visit a place in the middle of the nature, you should be prepared for the situations or conditions you will may find there. Below I list some items you must have with you:\n\n— sunscreen (even if you go during the winter)\n\n— cap (if you have those that protect also your neck even better)\n\n— sunglasses\n\n— bug spray\n\n— comfy shoes (if you don’t have the one for trekking, take good sneakers)\n\n— mid or long socks\n\n— a small backpack to bring for the small tours\n\n— a bottle for water (for less plastic around the world)\n\n— a rain coat\n\n— swimwear\n\n— a quick-drying towel (to bring with you during the trekking)\n\n— pullovers or jackets (it’s important to pack in layers and prepare for sun, rain, and cooler temps)\n\nWHAT TO DO\n\nWell, how many days and power do you have? 😀\n\nThat’s important to know, cause you can spend just a few days in the main cities, as the ones I listed above, as you can also go trekking only in one of the valleys during 5 to 7 days. Chapada Diamantina is one of Brazil’s most glorious national parks, with plenty of options for hiking and trekking through those gorgeous valleys, mountain plateaus, and enchanting caves. NEVER GO WITHOUT A GUIDE! The tracks are not so signalized so good that you can be independent, specially if you are not an expert.\n\nCLASSIC TOUR\n\nSuggested for you who have no more than 3 days to visit the park.\n\nLapa Doce Cave\n\nThe most famous cave in Chapada, the Lapa Doce was founded in 1986, in that period, the cave was thought to be the largest in Brazil. The cave is in the region of Iraquara and is different from many of the other caves as it airy and mostly flat.\n\nThe Lapa Doce Cave covers an area of 20 km, with an area of 850m open to the public. The biggest space within the cave is 60m wide and the entrance and 72m high. You will walk for 1h30 equipped with a flashlight, your guide will show you the stunning stalactites sculptured by the water inside this cave. The dimensions and formats will let you speechless! In the area exists around 42km of cave. The entrance is allowed in small groups, with a maximum of 12 people, and to get to the cave you go from the BA-122.\n\nPratinha & Blue Cave\n\nIt is distant from Lapa Doce about 20 minutes by car. This place is located inside a farm and your eyes will not believe on what they look at. It’s a kind of paradise in the middle of nowhere.\n\nIts water was elected the 3rd most crystalline water in the world. You can do some activities there as to float in this amazing water with bluish tonality, where you can see a large variety of fish, to do zip-line for 80 meters long and 12 meters high. The route conveys a feeling of free flight and ends up sliding on the crystal clear river; kayak, SUP and pedal boats.\n\nPai Inácio Hill\n\nAround 30km far from Lençóis this hill is 1.120 meters above the sea level and offers you a 360º of an amazing view. Lots of people love to arrive on its top for the sunset. But any time you go, you will love it! It’s only 20 to 30 minutes of hiking (depending on your conditions). The level of difficulty is not high. I saw even kids going up there.\n\nIf you are traveling with the family and any of the group doesn’t want to go, this person can stay in the par space on the base and wit for you to arrive back. The entrance costs around R$6,00 and when you organize the tour with a guide some tickets are already included, remember to check it out.\n\nPoço do Diabo\n\nThis part of the tour, like the Pai Inácio, is more hard to anyone who has heart or muscular problems or joints. For all the others ready for this, the view is just wow! The black water of the pit, the vegetation around, the stones, the energy… everything conspires for a blast of emotions. It’s important to have good shoes to not slip, water and a cap.\n\nIf you have more days and also are better prepared for trekking and hiking, let’s go forward and explore other areas, in this case in a more difficult level than the options I commented before.\n\nFumaça Waterfall\n\nThe second bigger waterfall of Brazil, Fumaça is located in the Capão Valley, in Palmeiras, and will ask for more preparing and good knees than the ones before. The waterfall is high over 300m, which are reached after a 12km climb/walk. I would say 4km are hard with a higher level of inclination, the rest is ok to be done.\n\nIt was a challenge to arrive at the top, and the worst came after all (but I will talk more ahead). The important is, the view and the feelings you will have at that point will compensate all the efforts. Specially during the high water season (winter), when the sound and volume of water on the waterfall are simply stunning!\n\nTry to go as earlier as possible, specially in the high season, to avoid the crowd and the heat (there is no shadow in this path). DON’T FORGET THE WATER, TO USE SUNSCREEN & TO HAVE A CAP WITH YOU! Our guide provided a “lunch” and a drink, but you should have more water with you. My husband got sunstroke after the trekking, and the next 3 days were spent on the bed. So don’t underestimate the heat, even if there is a fresh breeze sometimes.\n\nRiachinho\n\nThe place to relax after the trekking to Fumaça. It’s delicious to cool down from the heat, give a rest to your muscles while you appreciate an amazing sunset trough the valley.\n\nPati Valley\n\nIf you have enough time, please, don’t let this valley out of your plans. It’s an absolutely insane path, with beautiful views, an amazing energy and contact with the local community. It will be for sure unforgettable!\n\nHere you need to be fit! There is a small path with around 40km and a bigger one with 84km. You will walk some hours per day, trough valleys, jump from a stone to the other, take out your shoes to cross rivers, climb, walk more, sleep in the natives houses, who will cook for you with vegetables from their gardens for example, a simple way of life, but I am sure you will be amazed by this beautiful and peaceful place.\n\nIt’s extremely important to have a local guide. Again I recommend you to contact Luís Célio from the @zyonaventuras and trust on his suggestions. He will provide all what you need during your days there.\n\nPoço Encantado & Poço Azul\n\nMany of Chapada Diamantina’s best-known views are atop a plateau with sweeping valley view, but the area is also home to an astonishing number of Brazil’s caves, some with super-clear, still waters that can be explored with specialty swimming or diving tours.\n\nFar from Mucugê around 60km, the wells are truly magic! Your eyes will probably not believe in what they see. From April to September, everyday from 9am to 2pm, you can see that light which penetrate the well bringing to the light the amazing blue water and the shapes of the rocks.\n\nIn one of them you can float in the crystal clear water, after you take a shower to remove all the waste that you may have on your body and hair. The surface will trick you sometimes, when you can not understand what’s the surface or what is the ground.\n\nAs I had also my parents on a trip to this place, we tried to do not so intense things too. A beautiful option is to visit the Park of Orchids. Many exemplars of this stunning flower can be seen in a small area close to Pai Inácio Mountain. Another important detail of the history of this place is also available to visitors, the equipments and photographies of the men who tried the lucky on the hunt for diamonds.\n\nThere are many other alternatives of trekking around Chapada Diamantina. This park is bigger than some countries in Europe, so you can imagine the immensity of it. Go with time, and you will enjoy Bahia on its best. After all this days walking and climbing you can maybe read the post about Boipeba and choose it as your next destination, to have days of pure relax at the beach.\n\nNow I let you with some nice tips.\n\nWHEN TO GO?\n\nFrom April to May there are much less tourists, temperatures are good, varying from 21º to 30º and prices start to get better. You will have more chances to have clear sky with much more stars.\n\nFrom June to August is a bit colder, with 7º during the night and 20º during the day. The disadvantage is the fog, which can disrupt contemplation on some tours and force your guide to change the route.\n\nFrom September to November the temperatures are mild, but the volume of water is not the best to see the waterfalls or rivers in the most beautiful way.\n\nFrom December to March the rains are stronger, the river and waterfalls will get full, the days are hot and it’s the moment when Chapada receive more tourists. Considered the high season.\n\nOTHER TIPS:\n\n— Voltage is 220v\n\n— ATM can be easily found in Lençóis and Mucugê. Many hotels, shops and restaurants accept credit cards.\n\n— Cell service is unreliable. Another reason to have a guide is the lack of connectivity. He will be able to make arrangements for you sans cell service, which is essential in the park. Of course, there will be an extraordinary amount of opportunities to take shots on a trip to Chapada Diamantina, so definitely bring a camera. But know that cell phone service in the park is spotty at best. This is the perfect opportunity to leave your phone on airplane mode for a bit, disconnect, and enjoy nature without distraction.\n\nI hope I could help you to understand better this park, but if you still have any doubt leave me a comment and I will try my best to answer you."
