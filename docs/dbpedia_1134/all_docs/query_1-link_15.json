        "text": "Race as a Cultural Binder\n\nThe extensive mixing of races in Brazil has fascinated scholars who have often traced parallels with the United States. Historically speaking, in the United States racism was founded on biology (one-drop rule), while in Brazil stigmatization and discrimination were based on phenotype, that is, there was a veiled preference for Caucasian physical characteristics (Nogueira 287–308). In the United States, the Jim Crow laws guaranteed the separation between blacks and whites, and under the one-drop rule, African Americans with no visible signs of African ancestry would still be considered black, and would be punished for violating segregation laws or crossing the color line and trying to “pass” for white.1 Unlike African Americans, Afro-Brazilians did not need to circumvent the laws by pretending to be white, or negate African ancestry, because the “mulatto escape-hatch”2 and the absence of institutionalized forms of discrimination afforded many Afro-Brazilians opportunities unavailable in the United States.\n\nWhile, for the most part, the United States adopted a bi-racial system of classification, Brazil embraced a pluralistic system, based on “physiognomic characteristics and degrees of pigmentation” (Toplin 137). The popular expression dinheiro embranquece (“money whitens the skin”) illustrates the argument that, rather than racial discrimination, Brazilians usually hold a class prejudice, in which case skin color is not an impediment for class mobility (Toplin 140). To be considered black in Brazil, one should not have any percentage of white ancestry, otherwise he or she would fall into other racial categories such as pardo/a, mulato/a, moreno/a, and numerous other classifications. This information was confirmed in a 1976 study conducted by the Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics (IBGE) to respond to the needs of the people who complained that the five racial categories (white, black, brown, Indian, and Asian) that had been previously used to classify the population were insufficient to describe the variety of existent skin colors. Attempting to respond to the people’s complaint, the IBGE conducted a survey and collected 134 self-identifying terms, many of which just described physical appearance (Instituto Brasileiro de Geografia e Estatística 386).\n\nHoward Winant presents a revisionist reading of race categorization in Brazil and the United States. He reveals that the Brazilian racial complexity and the American bipolarity have undergone changes because “race has taken new forms in both countries as a result of new conflicts and new perceptions about racial identity, racial politics, and the very meaning of race in everyday life” (99). Winant observes that in the contemporary United States “racial identity is being transformed from dualistic to multipolar, in the case of minorities,” while in Brazil, “black identities are becoming more dualistic (as opposed to continuous)” (106). As an example, he cites the “color line,” which used to play a defining role in racial identity in the United States and has eroded now (106). Even though biracialism was the verifiable measure to define race classifications in the United States, in reality not all people were distinguished or treated just in terms of that bipolarity. It is a fact that light-skinned African Americans historically received a more preferential treatment than those who were darker. Robert Brent Toplin concludes that “out of America’s own subtle sliding scale of racial values came a socioeconomic pattern that resembled the Brazilian situation in many ways. The once popular American saying ‘If you are white, you’re right; if you’re brown, stick around; if you are black, stay back’ would be understood by many Brazilians regarding their own society” (148).3\n\nA number of scholars have examined the slippery nature of race categories in Brazil by discussing, for instance, how the word mulata (a parda woman) is oftentimes interwoven with the term morena (technically a brunette, olive-skinned woman). For Eakin, this exemplifies “the fluidity and ambiguity of Brazilian color categories” and how “all skin tones are in the eye of the beholder” (109).4 Natasha Pravaz wonders if the term mulata is not simply “a privileged signifier in a large paradigmatic chain of associating cultural terms such as cabrocha, morena, and baiana,” terms that can “denote ‘black woman’ or ‘light-skinned black woman’ and are inscribed in Brazil’s complex system of racial classification” (“Brazilian” 116). Adele Fátima, one of six young women that Oswaldo Sargentelli recruited for his original “show de mulatas,” in 1971, in the night club Sucata in Rio de Janeiro (Sargentelli 37–40), is considered a morena by most people. It remains to be determined if her success (in Sargentelli’s shows and as a model) owes much to the fact that her phenotype (lighter skin color) links her to the concept of boa aparência. The infamous concept of “good appearance”—which signals a lighter skin tone, straight or softly curled hair, and thin lips and nose—was so widely accepted or used in Brazil that it was included in job advertisements. Individuals who had “good appearance” were generally given preference when competing for employment, housing, a school spot, or other social and professional opportunities. Roberto DaMatta calls this veiled way of discriminating “racism the Brazilian way” (Relativizando 61), a practice that survived to the end of the twentieth century, even if it was not as conspicuous as it was in the 1950s and 1960s. The concept of “good appearance” finds a counterpart in the theory of um defeito de cor” (“a color defect”), as children would be categorized when born with a darker complexion or other physical characteristics that could indicate non-white ancestry.5\n\nAlthough guided by different principles and ways of categorizing and addressing race, both the United States and Brazil considered the black race a “problem” to be solved (Roosevelt 410). In the United States, white supremacists fought hard to keep the Caucasian population “untarnished,” while in Brazil miscegenation was already so prevalent that, in the beginning of the twentieth century, the alternative was to encourage interracial marriages to accelerate the process of “whitening” the population. Since the identification of a person’s race in Brazil is mostly determined by phenotype rather than ancestry, it was believed that miscegenation would dilute blackness to a point that most of the population would eventually be considered white, or almost white, by Brazilian standards. The white elite and the governing authorities hoped that through miscegenation, by the third generation, the children of interracial marriages would have lost most of the physical characteristics that could categorize them as direct descendants of African slaves. An illustration of such theory hung on the walls of the National Museum of Rio de Janeiro. The 1895 canvas by Modesto Brocos y Gómez, A Rendenção de Can (“The Redemption of Ham”) portrayed three generations affected by interracial mixing. At the back of the painting, Brocos y Gómez painted an older black woman and, in the center, he positioned a parda mother holding a light-complexioned child on her lap and sitting next to a white European companion/father of her child.\n\nBy the end of the nineteenth century, the large Afro-Brazilian population of both sexes had already successfully tiptoed its way past many racial and social crossroads. In the beginning of the twentieth century, the number of mixed-race individuals was high and, it was not uncommon for them to have formal education, or occupy some important positions in areas of political, military, literary, and artistic milieus. Consequently, miscegenation, the fluid racial interactions, the absence of racial segregation, and a certain preference for interracial sexual relations at the lower strata of society contributed to the pervasive image of Brazil as a racial democracy. Caulfield summarizes such discussions by stating that “Brazilians’ supposed tolerance, or even predilection, for interracial sexual relations was central to the theory that the population was ‘improving’ because of the ‘whitening’ effect of miscegenation” (146). As she further explains, these “contradictory ideas became pillars of nationalist ideologies of left and right in the 1920s and integral elements of the corporatist authoritarianism that eventually prevailed in the state policy in late 1930s” (146). Theodore Roosevelt rightfully predicted in 1914, during his visit to Brazil, that miscegenation would become a disseminated practice at the economically lower branches of Brazilian society, whereas the elite would remain mostly white since interracial marriages were not as common at that social and economic level (411). Nevertheless, as Thomas Skidmore, Carl N. Degler, Florestan Fernandes, and Thales de Azevedo, among others, have discussed, even if interracial marriages were not as common in the upper levels of Brazilian society, between 1900 and 1920, the ideology of whitening became popular in all strata of society because it was reaping social benefits and creating a desirable effect. By embracing a laidback attitude toward interracial marriages or co-habitation, the population could become whiter and be conceived as more modern and prosperous.\n\nThus, from the late 1890s to the first decades of the twentieth century, the established order bet on miscegenation to whiten the population hoping that it would make Brazilians look more “civilized” and socially more fluid. Miscegenation could provide another advantage: it would establish a positive image of the country as a flexible and harmoniously organized society that had a superior ethical attitude toward race (especially in comparison with the United States). This is an aspect that the newspaper O Paiz promoted on June 14, 1920, describing Brazil’s lack of discriminatory laws and the absence of hateful attitudes toward people of color as a strong indication of the moral superiority of its people (Caulfield 258, n. 2). The prospect of having a mostly white nation delighted the elite, and the pardo and black population also saw benefits because the ideology of whitening could accelerate their inclusion in society. The “mulatto escape-hatch” created a racial bridge between whites and blacks in Brazil, and a cultural and social ease so pervasive that it became part of the definition of the country’s national identity, celebrated in all arts and popularized in the twentieth century. A case in point is the popular 1939 song “Aquarela do Brazil” (“Watercolor of Brazil”) by Ari Barroso which overstresses the beauty and assets of Brazil, describing it as the land of the mulato inzoneiro” (“the good-looking mulatto”), and the morena sestrosa (“the beautiful brown girl”)6\n\nIt was not just Brazilians who applauded the ideology of whitening and embraced the concept of a racial democracy. Scholars have examined reports and other writings of American travelers and researchers who, until the 1950s, were enamored with the absence of racial violence and legal segregation in Brazil, and who considered the Brazilian model as a viable, or superior, alternative to standards in the United States.7 David J. Hellwig reveals that even African Americans saw Brazil as a model of racial democracy that should be emulated by the United States (18). To illustrate his point, he compiled twelve articles written between 1914 and 1926 which praised the Brazilian racial model. Most of them were published by African American thinkers in journals and magazines destined for a similar reading public (Hellwig 35, 45, 48, 52, 58, 82–83). In the 1930s, the effects of the Great Depression contributed to halt such publications presumably because people took fewer trips abroad, or because there was less money to invest in the publishing business (Hellwig 87). In the 1940s, the topic gained considerable attention again. France Windance Twine mentions that a study conducted by Donald Pierson (which concluded that racial issues were not a deciding factor in social opportunities in Brazil) and E. Franklin Frasier’s research (which also praised the country’s racial dynamics) are good samples of how a positive image of the Brazilian harmonious racial interaction continued to draw foreign attention (7).8 In commenting about why, in the 1940s, African Americans assumed Brazil was a racial democracy, Patrícia de Santana Pinho concludes that they were misguided by their country’s racial classification. As she discusses, “one of the reasons both Brazil and Cuba then became known as versions of racial paradise for African American travelers is due in part to how they, informed by the US one-drop rule, mistook mulattoes, several of whom were occupying high social and political positions, for blacks” (25).\n\nIn the 1930s and 1940s, Gilberto Freyre’s publications played a significant role in validating the concept of a Brazilian racial democracy. He wrote extensively about the African impact on Brazilian culture, and his texts, particularly his 1933 Casa Grande a Senzala (“The Masters and the Slaves,” 1946 translation), influenced the definition of Brazil as a race-embracing democratic republic. Vianna construes that The Masters and the Slaves broke with previous ways of analyzing Brazilian culture because Freyre argued that miscegenation played a positive role in distinguishing Brazil as a nation that embraced racial equality (43). Freyre also promoted the importance of African-derived cultural manifestations, considering them the sincerest expression of Brazilian culture (Vianna 278). Even if Freyre did not coin the expression “racial democracy,”9 from the 1930s to the 1950s, his influence on cultivating the idea of miscegenation as evidence of lack of racism contributed to propagate the idea of a racial egalitarian society in Brazil. Therefore, cultural products like samba and Afro-Brazilian cuisine became powerful symbols of diversity and inclusiveness and were integrated into Vargas’s populist agenda. The government also included capoeira, soccer and carnaval into the nationalist project of the late 1930s and 1940s which contributed to validate several forms of popular cultural. For Eakin, “while samba became the symbol par excellence of mestiçagem, in popular music, carnaval emerged in the 1930s and 1940s as the principal ritual showcasing the Freyrean vision” (90). By streamlining manifestations of African origin into the concept of a national identity, Vargas’s policies affected those cultural productions in Brazil positively, and drew attention to some unique features of popular culture (Taylor 18). However, as Vianna argues, the Vargas regime found itself at a crossroad: to elevate practices of African origin—most of which were prosecuted and forbidden until the mid-1930s—and embrace the idea of a Brazil mestizo par excellence it would require abandoning “the old ideal of ‘whitening’” (113). The way to work around this conundrum was to make those practices of African origin and the idea of mestiçagem significant by convincing intellectuals and the white elite to adopt the cause. Even if the idea was not homogeneously accepted, it gradually took root and became the trump card used to advocate the notion that, as a racially-mixed society, Brazil was morally superior (especially when compared to the United States) because it was more inclusive and open-minded. In analyzing the impact of Vargas’s policies, Vianna contends that “Brazil was perhaps the first country in which mestiço pride and elements of urban popular culture combined to create a widely consensual national identity” (113).\n\nVargas’s ideological project and populist policies of the 1930s and 1940s were revisited and reformulated by the 1964–1985 military dictatorship (Chauí 90, 99). From the late 1960s to early 1980s, popular culture became part of the ideology of a national integration which the authoritarian regime implemented. In this political environment, during the so-called “economic miracle years” of the 1970s, the dictatorship used popular culture to promote an image of Brazil as a joyful, sexy, carefree, and fast-developing country. Echoing Vargas’s dogmatic bent and nationalist guidelines, the authoritarian government reinforced the concept of a racial democracy by focusing on several popular traditions that could nurture and inspire the sense of pride in Brazil’s cultural and racial diversity. By officially linking popular culture to national identity, the governing authorities provided the masses with a coping mechanism, diverting attention from the regime’s pervasive atrocities against human rights and/or its callous censorship against freedom of the press and speech. At that time, the country witnessed a substantial growth in the demand for and appreciation of African-derived popular culture. It was then that capoeira was promoted to the status of a “national sport,” soccer was Brazil’s jogo bonito, and carnaval festivities exuded sensuality, creativity, and fun. The government used a diversity of cultural productions to sew together the image of unity in diversity.\n\nThe “Made-in-Brazil Mulata”\n\nimportance to sex in defining themselves as a people because, as Richard G. Parker notices, “individually and collectively, most of them derive their sense of identity from a positive perception of their sensuality” (8). The exotic and erotic lure of the Afro-Brazilian woman, established in colonial and imperial Brazil, contributed to foment existing sexual stereotypes about Afro-Brazilian females. Freyre’s tireless descriptions and analyses of parda women as sexual partners is a legacy that remains alive because the theorizing of national identity in Brazil still includes references to gender, race, and sexuality/ sensuality (S. Costa 42). Lélia Gonzalez (229–35) traces the myth of the parda woman’s unhinged sensuality/sexuality and their everlasting disposition for sex to the practice of selecting female African descendants to work as mucamas in the plantation houses. According to Gonzalez, when the term mucama (a Kimbundu word meaning “mistress slave”) made its way into the Portuguese language, it gained some additional meanings. It was still used to refer to young women of African ancestry who were selected to be special concubines and perform sexual favors for slave owners and younger males of the families, but it also referred to those who were assigned lighter domestic chores and/or kept company with the lady of the house (a lady-in-waiting). Mucamas often found themselves in ambiguous situations: if they did not fulfill expectations, they could receive physical punishment or be sexually abused; if they engaged in sexual affairs with the slave owners, they could be submitted to attacks of jealousy by white mistresses. Most mucamas adapted to the situation and took advantage of the system, in some cases, they managed to maintain long-lasting relationships with white men of the household (Giacomini, Mulher 23–28). Thus, it was not unusual for mucamas to utilize their social and intermediary position in the house—as retainers and as a source of sexual pleasure—to negotiate better living conditions, or even their freedom. It is in this context that the Afro-Brazilian women’s social and physical mobility also contributed to disseminate the idea that they were highly skilled in the art of lovemaking.\n\nIn colonial days, white men avoided criticism from their families and/or ecclesiastic authorities for their dissolute behavior, licentious conduct, or moral double standards by blaming parda women’s ardent temperament. By categorizing them as irresistible creatures whose lack of moral values, bewitching charm, and a tantalizing sexuality seduced them, they reversed the argument. These are some characteristics that Freyre details in chapters four and five of The Masters and the Slaves, when he analyzes the African impact on sexual and family life in colonial Brazil, and traces the deployment of the myth of the Afro-Brazilian woman’s everlasting disposition for sex (278–476). He writes that scholars such as Raymundo Nina Rodrigues and José Veríssimo contributed enormously to disseminate such ideas. Rodrigues championed the concept of “the lascivious hybrid woman” by describing her as “an abnormal, sexually superexcited type,” while Veríssimo considered her a “‘dissolvent of physical and moral virility’” (Freyre, Masters 402). In Freyre’s opinion, there were also other major contributing factors to such stereotyping; namely: a) the impact that popular songs had on disseminating ideas about the parda women’s lust and sensuality; b) fear of homosexuality; c) the imposition of virginity to white, unmarried women; and d) the role travel narratives played in describing Brazilian lifestyle and costumes. The songs of the colonial period often referred to the Afro-Brazilian women’s allure and sinfulness, most probably because those females did not have to abide by the strict moral, religious, and social codes forced on white females.\n\nFor historical and social reasons, black and white women had fewer opportunities than the brown population to overtly express their sexuality and sensuality. White women were excessively guarded before and after marriage, and black women were overridden as unattractive, oftentimes overworked and too tired to engage in lovemaking. The belief that brown women had an everlasting disposition for sex was also born out of a fear of homosexuality that permeated every plantation house. As Freyre discusses, to avoid mockery and secure heirs, parents made heterosexual intercourse an integral part of their boys’ rite of passage from childhood to puberty, or from puberty to adolescence. They crafted opportunities for their sons to be sexually initiated by slave women, usually young, charming, and well-groomed mucamas. The lighter the skin, the more probability a slave had of being chosen for such a position. Therefore, the standards by which masculinity was measured, and progeny was secured, depended heavily on the acceptance and glorification of men as womanizers and procreators, most often at the expense of Afro-Brazilian women. The third category to which Freyre refers is the strict Catholic and patriarchal codes of honor, morality, virginity, and chastity for women of the upper social class. As a result, Afro-Brazilian females become the repository of the white men’s lust, and indirectly protected the virtues of white damsels.\n\nThe topic has drawn the interest of literary critics, historians, anthropologists, and social scientists. For instance, Parker contends that, for most Brazilians, “the mulata possesses a charm and attractiveness unimaginable in any other woman anywhere else in the world” (153). Queiroz Júnior traces the development of that myth in songs and literature, discussing the important role that literary texts played in establishing the mestizo woman as an aesthetic and sexual symbol of Brazil.10 John Burdick’s work also examines the experience of women of African descent in Brazil and discusses “the color of love” and “the mulata and morena in the courtship arena” (26–50). In tracing and examining the long-standing association of mixed-race women, food, and sex, Sant’Anna argues that literary texts popularized the image of the Afro-Brazilian woman as someone who is always “good in bed and in the kitchen” (O canibalismo, 19). Sant’Anna questions the rules of erotic-racial-economic endogamy and exogamy by describing how those texts dramatize the play between the white women who could become spouses, and the parda females who should be mistresses and thus be “eaten,” that is, laid (O canibalismo, 19). To this day, examples of the association between parda women, sex, and food abound. Several incarnations of oversexed Afro-Brazilian women who cook well appear in novels, poems, songs, films, television programs, advertisements, and jokes. In those venues they are also linked to certain flavors, smells, and exotic spices which, when combined, connote their sensuality and eroticism.11\n\nDaMatta also analyzes the metaphors of eating and having sex in O Que Faz o Brasil, Brasil? (“What Makes Brazil What It Is?”). He gives several accounts of situations in which eating is used as a reference for having sex, an indication that women are considered food to be savored. The comparison also applies to homosexual relationships where the terms “active” and “passive” are often used (51–64). As DaMatta summarizes his analyses:\n\nA relação sexual e o ato de comer, portanto, aproximam-se num sentido tal que indica de que modo nós, brasileiros, concebemos a sexualidade e a vemos, não como um encontro de opostos e iguais … mas como um modo de resolver essa igualdade pela absorção. (60)\n\nA sexual act and the act of eating, therefore, are so entangled that they reveal how we Brazilians conceive sexuality, not as an encounter of opposite and equal sexes … but rather as a hierarchy in which the one who eats swallows the one eaten.\n\nThe representations of women as “edible” substances so prominent in novels such as Jorge Amado’s Gabriela, Clove and Cinnamon and Dona Flor and Her Two Husbands, and Aluísio de Azevedo’s O Cortiço also appears in telenovelas, and songs. Those texts emblematize the longstanding admiration in Brazilian society for texts and contexts that link women to mouthwatering food and spicy sex (especially in reference to women of color). DaMatta endorses this cultural trend when he considers that “Gabriela revoluciona com as armas que possui: seu corpo, seu tempero, sua comida, seu cheiro de cravo e seu sabor de canela (“Gabriela revolutionizes by using her body, cooking abilities, and appealing to the senses with the taste of exotic food”; O Que 112). The same type of associations can be found in television commercials. For instance, in 2002, to advertise a beer brand during carnaval, a computer-generated advertisement established a visual connection between a brown body and a dark beer bottle. The commercial began with a morena dressed in a skimpy bikini, dancing samba on the top arch of the sambódromo, Rio de Janeiro’s five-block amphitheater built especially for samba parades. (The amphitheater is crowned by a large concrete M that has been popularly interpreted as a reference to the word mulata.) For about thirty seconds at a time, the intermittent image of the woman’s body and the beer bottle complemented and supplemented each other, shape-changing to the frenzied rhythm of the carnaval songs. The connection between the pleasure of drinking beer, and the visual delight of watching the seducing body, was unmistakably clear as the image of the brown beer bottle and the parda woman and its gustativevisual-sexual discursivity sustained a voyeuristic pleasure.12\n\nTelenovelas offer another source of promoting the benefits of miscegenation and racial democracy and depicting women of color as symbols of Brazil’s sexuality, sensuality, and culinary talents. Banking on the fact that the concept of an all-inclusive national identity is popular, television networks in Brazil—with Globo leading the way—have aired a string of serialized dramas that connect food and sex with brown women because it is a topic that still appeals to viewers. Of special significance are Globo’s telenovelas that air at prime time because they are broadcast at a time when they reach a large number of viewers. A good example is O Clone (“The Clone”), a telenovela aired in 2001–2002, in which Solange Couto played the role of Dona Jura. She had the emblematic part of the parda woman who used any excuse to have a party, dance, flaunt her wiles, and display her outstanding cooking abilities. She owned a bar in São Cristóvão, a working-class neighborhood of Rio de Janeiro, and her culinary abilities and the festive environment of her commercial establishment were so impressive that they attracted customers from all social classes, including VIPs who became regulars.13 In real life, at the age of sixteen, Couto became one of the Afro-Brazilian women who were part of Sargentelli’s 1969 pioneering show of mulatas (Dalevi).14 In the scene taped on April 12, 2002, Sargentelli lent his prestige to his former mulata by visiting her bar to savor her exotic food while interacting with Afro-Brazilian women dancing samba. Ironically, and sadly, Sargentelli was overtaken by the emotion of reconnecting with Couto in an environment that reminded him of the first group of performers he promoted and suffered a heart attack at the age of seventy-eight while still at the studio.15 As distressing and unfortunate as this news was, it seemed to reinforce the idea that brown Afro-Brazilian women possess an irresistible, arresting, and dangerous sex appeal, all of which combined with exotic and spicy foods could prove too strong for the weak heart.\n\nThe sensuality of the Afro-Brazilian woman is a concept so embedded in Brazilian cultural ethos that it guarantees a captive audience. In 2003, Globo launched Da Cor do Pecado (“The Color of Sin”), another prime time telenovela showcasing a beautiful brown Afro-Brazilian woman (Taís Araújo) who was an excellent cook/restaurant owner, romantically involved with a white man. The title of the telenovela undermines any positive projection of her character because pecado is closely associated with seduction, temptation, and promiscuity, and the title suggests that those character deviations are genetic blueprints (resulting from the color of her skin). Since the interest in the topic is pervasive, in the telenovela America (2005–2006), Couto was cast again, this time as Dalva, a samba dancer who embodied the concept of the “made in Brazil mulata,” and reached international recognition (or so she claimed) by dancing in European night clubs. Twelve years later, when her mother (who was her child’s caretaker) died, Dalva returned to Brazil to reveal the name of the boy’s father so that he could raise him, and she would be free to return to Europe. While she waited for the right moment to make her announcement, Couto’s character boasted about her lifestyle in Europe and graced Vila Isabel’s dance floors with her samba skills. Dalva reinforced several stereotypes regarding Afro-Brazilian women: she embraced the mulata profession, was oversexed, and uninterested in raising her child because she was unfit for motherhood (supposedly a pious and sanctimonious quality which a true mulata would not have). Although Couto played an important part in America, her role withstood the racial ambivalence of the Brazilian social system which promotes women of color as national symbols of sensuality and sexuality, gastronomy, and cultural ambassadors of samba and carnaval, but does not deviate from those roles.\n\nIn the 2007–2008 prime time telenovela Duas Caras (“Two Faces”), Globo added a little twist to the plot by raising awareness about the dangers of signing up to “dance samba” in Europe because of the extensive trafficking of women and prostitution rings. The plot introduced Faustina, a woman who disappeared for a few years and returned to Brazil as countess Finzi-Contini. In the fantasy realm of the telenovela, she met an old nobleman in Italy who rescued her from prostitution and slavery, married her, named her the sole heir of his immense fortune, and died shortly after. To educate Afro-Brazilian women about the perils of attempting to pursue the mulata profession in Europe, and end up enslaved in a prostitution ring, she established an NGO in Brazil. Although the telenovela draws attention to a very serious and real problem, it still idealizes the mulata profession by conveying the idea that, even if the chances are slim and the price is high, beautiful and young Afro-Brazilian women can climb the social ladder by dancing samba and marrying rich European counts. Since, for the most part, Globo’s telenovelas have a purported social, cultural, and didactic agenda, Duas Caras also educated the population about racial respect and tolerance, by having the characters use politically correct terms, and by highlighting the perils of a racist society, and the importance of cordial race relations. However, while the telenovela reveals the racial ambivalence often found in Brazilian society, and questions Brazil’s racial democracy, it also reinforces the ideology of whitening by presenting several interracial marriages (as a solution to correct or eradicate racism). The theme is recurrent. A case in point is the 2017–2018 telenovela, O Outro Lado do Paraíso (“The Other Side of Paradise”), which offered discussions about racism, presented interracial couples, and cast an Afro-Brazilian woman in the role of a good cook. The positive change in O Outro Lado do Paraíso was that the character moved out of poverty, not by dancing samba or embracing the mulata profession—as presented in previous telenovelas—but by working her way out of poverty, attending law school, and becoming a competent judge. Thus, the brown Afro-Brazilian woman is one of the most celebrated, discussed, and stereotyped female character. She appears in travel accounts, paintings, songs, films, television programs, cultural shows, popular sayings, and in modern time, she is featured in advertisements, and sought after for sex tourism.16\n\nVisual artists, musicians, and intellectuals in the first decades of the twentieth century adopted the concept of mestiçagem and celebrated the “made-in-Brazil mulata.” A case in point is Emiliano Di Cavalcanti, one of the most prestigious painters of Brazilian Modernism, who asserted that, by definition, mulatas have to be Afro-Brazilians because they are living proof of the country’s policy of miscegenation, symbolize the concept of “Brazilianness,” and thus represent a “national product.” In explaining why he painted Afro-Brazilian women so frequently, he confided that, for him, as a symbol of Brazil, the parda woman holds a racial and social intermediary position; she also likes music and soccer: “Para mim, a mulata é o símbolo do Brasil. Ela não é nem preta nem branca. Nem rica nem pobre. Ela gosta de música e futebol” (qtd. in R. Rosa). Di Cavalcanti’s definition of a mulata goes beyond a race category to express what she likes and dislikes, establishing her as the measure of real Brazilianness. Such concept continued to expand and became so polyvalent that since the late 1960s the word mulata has acquired other meanings. It has been used, for instance, to refer to young females of African ancestry who make a living dancing samba in night clubs or tourist spots (Sargentelli 44, 70–71), advertising carnaval on television, traveling in dance groups, or participating in sex tourism. Thus, the term mulata can refer to a parda woman, but it can also denote a profession embraced by Afro-Brazilian females who master the art of samba dancing to perform in public spaces.\n\nIn his autobiography Ziriguidum, Sargentelli recalls that, in 1969, during a roda de samba (a samba gathering) at a bar, he was brainstorming with friends for an idea to produce a cultural show when he suddenly thought of the word mulata, inspired by the traditional carnaval marchinha, “O Teu Cabelo Não Nega” (“Your Hair Does Not Deny It”) that his uncle, Lamartino Babo, popularized in 1931 (37). In the song, the lyric voice identifies a brown Afro-Brazilian woman by her phenotype (her hair) and invites her for a night of lovemaking:\n\nO teu cabelo não nega, mulata\n\nPorque és mulata na cor\n\nMas como a cor não pega, mulata\n\nMulata, eu quero o teu amor.17\n\nYour hair reveals, mulata\n\nThat you are a mestizo woman\n\nBut since skin color is not contagious,\n\nMulata, I want your love.\n\nThe song harbors notions of color prejudice and a cordial racism as it informs that the male considers it acceptable to have the Afro-Brazilian female as a sexual partner only because race is not contagious or sexually transmittable, in other words, he does not run the risk of becoming racially compromised and, consequently, socially impaired. In analyzing the lyrics of “O Seu Cabelo Não Nega,” Pravaz writes that “a close look at the syntax and semantics of the song might give us a clue into the reasons why the Carnivalesque march has come to be considered one of the most important recordings of Brazilian popular music and one of the most successful Carnival songs of all time” (“Imagining” 53).\n\nSargentelli banked on the conventional description of Afro-Brazilian women as hybrid, licentious, and sensuous figures, and in 1969, produced and directed a “mulata program” in which he featured only young and beautiful Afro-Brazilian women (Sargentelli 37–52). While he is not responsible for the pervasive stereotyping regarding Afro-Brazilian women, and while he borrowed and adapted the idea for his shows from performances that featured white women in Brazil and Europe, Sargentelli takes credit for having shaped the contours of the “made-in-Brazil mulata,” and for having put his signature on a new profession (39). As he acknowledges, he modelled his shows after Carlos Machado who had previously produced similar programs for the night clubs Night & Day and Casablanca. The difference is that Sargentelli decided to include only Afro-Brazilian females who he handpicked to showcase the concepts of miscegenation and a racial democracy as they danced to the samba rhythm (Sargentelli 39).18 In his autobiography, Sargentelli confides that his career as a mulatólogo (“mulata producer”) began after the 1964 military coup d’état, when the authorities considered his radio and television shows subversive and forbade him from working as a journalist. Ironically, he found a niche for his new career in the government’s cultural and political agenda that elected carnaval, soccer, capoeira, and other lay and religious festivities as representative samples of Brazilian cultural identity (Sargentelli 43–47). He and his associates opened night clubs in Rio de Janeiro (Sambão, Sucata, and Oba, Oba), and he directed a cultural show which consisted of stand-up comedy routine, and Afro-Brazilian women parading their bodies dressed in scant bikinis, dancing samba in impeccable postures to the feverish rhythm of carnaval music. As seasoned performers accustomed to dealing with captive audiences, they were aware of the power of their bodies, exuded sensuality, and exchanged vibrational energy with the public.\n\nSargentelli was so successful in his new professional endeavor that, in addition to the three night clubs in Rio de Janeiro, he and his associates opened other similar venues in São Paulo and Porto Alegre, and in 1974, developed a touring company called “Oba, Oba” (Sargentelli 44, 70–71).19 To staff his performances, he recruited up to forty women who worked for him at different night clubs. He also promoted the show in Europe, calling it “Sargentelli e as Mulatas Que Não Estão no Mapa” (“Sargentelli and the Out-of-This-World Mulatas”; Sargentelli 37–52). He successfully sugarcoated his stand-up comedy and musical program with the ideological argument that, by choosing only Afro-Brazilians to perform in his shows, he was promoting “Brazilianness” and creating job opportunities. He personally selected the women whose age group ranged from sixteen to twenty-five years old, most of them from economically challenged neighborhoods. To be selected, they had to conform to the parameters and definition he outlined in an interview in which he explained that “Mulatas have thin waists, thick thighs, naughty little-girl faces, good teeth, and very good smell; they shake and jiggle, making everyone’s mouth water” (Dalevi). Sargentelli’s definition of the made-in-Brazil mulatas does not describe them racially; it adopts a misogynist and mercantile concept presenting them as objects of desire and consumer goods. In some ways, his selection criteria reproduce the colonial model that slave owners would use to pick Africans in the slave markets or choose mucamas to work in the plantation houses.\n\nSargentelli’s cultural shows became so popular that they generated a series of copycats. To meet the demand of the tourism industry, several night club programs and folkloric groups began recruiting experienced mulatas for their programs, shows, and cultural events which, in turn, led special groups in Rio de Janeiro to train candidates for the mulata job. As Sônia Maria Giacomini mentions, those courses prepared young, pretty, brown-skinned women—who were also skilled samba dancers—to become competitive in the market (“Aprendendo” 213–46). They learned choreography and how to apply makeup, acquired some sophisticated norms of etiquette and posture, mastered the art of seducing/engaging an audience and, at the conclusion of the course, received a certificate. The list of the attributes and skills that Giacomini compiled reveals that for mulatas to be tall is a plus, and to be construed as a mulata one should also be responsible, keep appointments, arrive on time for rehearsals, and groom the body well, similar to the requirements for a modeling profession.20 Pravaz distinguishes between passistas who do not charge for their dancing talents and usually parade during the carnaval festivities, and mulatas, “women who engage in dancing the samba in a commodified spectacle and receive some form of remuneration” (“Imagining” 48).21 Such distinction can be used as a general way of discussing the profissão mulata; however, it does not account for the fact that one category does not eliminate the other. For instance, Valéria Valenssa and Adele Fátima offer two outstanding samples of how malleable these categories are. As illustrated in Roberto Faustino’s video recording Escolas de Samba: O Espetáculo. A Documentary of Rio’s Carnaval, Globeleza Valenssa embodied the mulata category and was a passista in carnaval parades in Rio de Janeiro and São Paulo. Adele Fátima was both part of the group of six women selected by Sargentelli to dance samba in his first mulata show, and a famous passista, holding the coveted position of madrinha da bateria (“carnaval queen”).\n\nAs seducers of audiences, mulatas resemble erotic dancers, and walk a tight rope between a belly dancer and a prostitute. As far as the economic and social gains that performing jobs or media attention can bring, the mulata profession could be compared to the work of Victoria’s Secret models, although not considered as glamourous. The mulata coaching in Rio de Janeiro that Giacomini discussed resembles the preparation that Venezuelan women receive to compete in international beauty pageants, or geisha training in Japan. It can also be argued that Couto, Valenssa, or the other “made-in-Brazil mulatas” have jobs similar to Las Vegas showgirls, or even Playboy bunnies. In all these professions there are similarities as to the use of the body and the endorsement of the exploitative model. Nevertheless, even if images of white women (fashion models, for instance) are part of the concept of a sensual Brazil, the parda women have an additional task: they are the emblematic tokens of a purported racial democracy and a brown nation. The mulata is described as a symbol of Brazil, and as such, she holds the key to the understanding of the significance that sexuality-sensuality and eroticism-exoticism plays “within the paradoxes of Brazilian life, within the double standard of a patriarchal tradition developed in a slaveholding society,” as Parker contends (153). In no other cultural manifestation in Brazil have women of color manifested their dance skills so vividly or projected a sensual image so deliberately than during the carnaval season. In Carnivals, Rogues, and Heroes, DaMatta discusses Rio’s carnaval parades as a representation of the complexity of Brazilian culture (61–82). His interpretation of Brazilian carnaval presupposes a symbiotic harmony of gender, race, and class in which people intermingle democratically on the streets, and invert relations of power by moving from the margins to the center during the parades, projecting the image of a country united in its liveliness and exuberance. However, as the “mulata profession” exemplifies, the image of a hybrid, resourceful, and playful country also promotes a quest for identity through the exotic and erotic experience and overlooks the ambiguities prevalent in gender and race relations in Brazil.\n\nCarnaval: Tokens Mistaken for Wonders22\n\nSince the mid-nineteenth century, carnaval festivities have been associated with masks and costumes which have been popular in Brazil. It was then that the first bands and adorned floats paraded on the streets of Rio de Janeiro, and the revelers marched or danced to the sound of instruments and carnaval songs. Since 1928, samba schools (associations that parade during carnaval) have taken to the streets of Rio de Janeiro with their dazzling displays of colors, costumes, and floats, creating a visual extravaganza rivaled only by the fast and contagious rhythms of the musicians and dancers.23 The participants in the samba parades usually live in shantytowns or impoverished neighborhoods, but dress up in lavish costumes, create elaborate floats and choreography, and put on an unmatched show for national and international spectators. It is in the media-controlled and monitored environment of carnaval parades that the image of the mulata comes forth as a national product, an erotic ideal, and an intrinsic part of “the sensual ethos”24 of Brazilian life, in general, and of the carnaval season, in particular.\n\nSuch a symbolic representation was highlighted in the early 1990s when Globo Television Network created the character Globeleza (“Globo’s beauty”) and selected Valéria da Conceição dos Santos (who adopted the stage name Valéria Valenssa) to play the role. The first step in that direction happened in 1989 when she entered a beauty pageant, The Tropical Girl, a variation of The Girl from Ipanema contest. Valenssa did not win the competition because, she argues, the title is traditionally awarded to a Caucasian beauty, and she was “the only black woman in the pageant” (Bergallo and Duarte 44). Analyzing her professional transformation, she considers that, in a way, she won a larger and more important beauty pageant because the Tropical Girl contest gave her the visibility she needed to be noticed by Globo executives (Valenssa, “Personal interview”).25 She competed with more than 100 women from São Paulo and Rio de Janeiro and won the audition to become the face of Globo’s advertising campaign for carnaval parades, in 1990 (Valenssa, “Interview” by Barbosa; Bergallo and Duarte 45). In 1993, Globo’s producers re-invited her to star in the Globeleza’s promotional vignette, and she signed a long-term contract with the network, becoming its carnaval ambassador-at-large (Valenssa, “Interview” by Barbosa).\n\nFor the next fourteen years the two main designers—Hans Donner, from Austria, and his first wife Sylvia Trenker, from Switzerland—created the drawings that were rendered on Valenssa’s body. The “costume” that she wore for Globo’s vignettes, and occasionally to parade with the samba associations, consisted of decorative body paint and a thin strip of surgical tape that partially covered her pubic area. The chromatic code the designers developed to market the Globeleza character explored the visual appeal of a few designs in glittering, water-resistant colors painted on her body. Donner and his team fashioned an arresting image of Globeleza by drawing different geometrical designs on Valenssa’s body. The media followed those developments closely and applauded every representation of Globeleza, focusing on the artistic aspects of the designs and on her construed sensuality. Her performance established a “libidinal investment”26 as it reinforced the imperatives and urgencies of a specific discourse that established the “lure of desire” and “lure of mimetic reflection,”27 with the purpose of enticing viewers to watch Globo’s broadcast of carnaval celebrations.\n\nFor a decade and a half, during the carnaval season, in ten to fifteen second television spots, Valenssa performed as Globeleza, and graced the front pages of popular magazines and internet sites. Her performance aimed at inducing viewers to watch the network’s advertisement of parades and other carnaval celebrations. In doing so, the network construed an erotic enterprise to represent the Brazilian seductive energy (Petrini 130). The intermittent fleeting images of Valenssa’s body parts dancing to the rhythm of a catchy jingle functioned as a provocative and flirtatious performative device that teased the viewers, inviting them to piece together her body in movement. Set to enrapture the viewers in the message of unity in diversity, the Globeleza vignette combined visual, acoustic, and linguistic effects to establish a connection between cultural production and national identity.\n\nThe language of traditional jingles is catchy and simple, the verses rhyme, they last just a few seconds, and are intended to advertise consumer goods. Intent on reaching a pre-established market and generate commercial success, Donner and his team set the Globeleza image to an engaging tune composed by Jorge Aragão. The Globeleza jingle delivers the message connecting the mulata body, national product, and carnaval celebrations:\n\nVem pra ser feliz,\n\nEu tô no ar, tô Globeleza,\n\nEu tô que tô legal\n\nNa tela da TV,\n\nNo meio desse povo,\n\nA gente vai se ver na Globo.28\n\nCome to be happy.\n\nI am on air, I am Globeleza,\n\nI am doing just fine,\n\nOn the TV screen,\n\nIn the middle of the people,\n\nWe will see each other on Globo.\n\nBy presenting variations on a theme every year, Globo built a cultural dynamic with viewers, simultaneously re-asserting old meanings and introducing new visual parameters. For instance, in 2000, Brazil celebrated the 500-year anniversary of the official “discovery” of the country, and themes related to the land, its peoples, and Portuguese colonization dominated the carnaval festivities. Apparently, in the spirit of celebrating the indigenous people of Brazil, Globeleza wore a stylized headdress and her body was painted to resemble the designs imprinted on the bodies of the indigenous women the Portuguese encountered, and which Pero Vaz de Caminha detailed in a long letter he wrote to Dom Manuel, the King of Portugal, between April 26 and May 7, 1500. Caminha informed the monarch that, on their way to India, the Portuguese fleet had found a new land. He offered a meticulous account of the people, their surroundings, and lifestyle, and described how captivated he felt by the people’s natural ways of living and the looks of their bare bodies. He explained that their attire consisted mainly of body paint, headdresses, and pieces of bones pinned to their lips and earlobes.\n\nIn referring to women, he described their physical attributes in very complimentary terms, paying special attention to one of them whose body was rounded, well-shaped, and painted from top to bottom with a special tincture of different colors. Caminha had equal admiration for the fertility of the land, the abundance of water, and good weather.29 His letter became the first historical document and literary text about Brazil, and provided an intellectual synthesis and a gendered interpretation of the land and the people the Portuguese encountered. Thus, it must have escaped Donner and Globo’s executives that their thematic choice was ideologically telling. They reproduced the colonial model by connecting Valenssa’s body painting and headdress to the designs the Portuguese colonizers admired on the bodies of the indigenous women they first encountered in Brazil, and whose original coastal cultures were decimated in less than a century after the “discovery.”\n\nIn 2002, Donner and his design team decorated Valenssa’s body with twelve stylized butterflies which the media interpreted as a creative novelty because it connected her to nature and presented a light and fluid design that contrasted, in a positive way, with the geometrical format of several other drawings previously imprinted on her body. The butterflies were hailed as symbols of her lightness, representations of the fluidity of her dance movements, markers of her sensuality, and an indication of a more evolving pattern. In this case, the free-floating lightness that the butterflies represented could also purportedly embody the volatility of the mulata body in the general consensus of race and sexuality in Brazil. It could further, and ultimately, be interpreted as embodiment of the malleability of Brazilian racial relations, and the dynamics of social mobility that carnaval represents. In the 2003 carnaval season, another significant variation occurred because Valenssa was pregnant with her first child. To offer the viewers something original, Globo compiled images of her previous performances to present the carnaval vignette and surprised the spectators by ending it with the image of an expectant Globeleza in the nude. Valenssa mentions that she received several letters from women who thanked her for performing the Globeleza character while noticeably pregnant. Those letters expressed viewers’ support and gratitude for her bold gesture and contribution to demystifying taboos about pregnancy and sensuality (Valenssa, “Interview” by Barbosa).\n\nThe letters Valenssa received from her fans corroborate the information that Célia Abicalil Belira collected in large urban centers in Brazil for her study on photography, pregnancy, sensuality, eroticism, and the space of the expectant body in Brazilian society. Belira discusses the changes that have taken place since the actress Leila Diniz was photographed sunbathing in a small bikini while pregnant in the 1970s (411–23). In sync with new waves of Feminism in Brazil, in the 1980s and 1990s, “the aesthetic of pregnancy” challenged the traditional patterns of behavior that associate expectant mothers with modesty and piety. To disseminate the new aesthetic and win public opinion more easily, several famous models and actresses agreed to pose in the nude, or in semi-nudity, in advanced stages of their pregnancies, for photos on front pages or covers of reputable newspapers and magazines such as Jornal do Brasil and Pais e Filhos (Belira 421). This new visual received the readers’ positive acceptance, and the images of pregnant-nude women contributed to create a “space of eroticism” for expectant mothers, establishing new standards for the evaluation of sexuality and sensuality (Belira 421). In this cultural context, it is easy to understand why several women believe Valenssa contributed to improve their self-esteem and advance the feminist cause in Brazil.\n\nWhile it is not an overstatement to say that social, racial, and sexual categories in Brazil are malleable, it is also true that the borderline between having a prudish attitude toward the body and allowing it to be exploited in commercial ventures is fuzzy and often overlooked. A case in point is the definition of sensuality expressed in the popular magazine Revista Época which, in 2000, elected Valenssa “the natural heir of the feminists from the 60s and 70s” (1). It theorizes that she had become the prototype of an emancipated modern woman who “takes control over her body without letting go of seduction” (1; see also Moreno 44–46). Such discourse contributes to create a social and cultural displacement since the image that is promoted—a feminine and feminist woman is the one who is not afraid of exhibiting or displaying her body—masks an ideology of marketing, and reinforces the notion that “femininity” should always be attached to the word “sexy,” both in its metaphorical associations and in its explicit connotation of arousing, or tending to arouse, sexual desire. It seems that only in this context can the mulata profession be considered a career for emancipated women.\n\nWhen she became pregnant for the second time, Globo used the advanced technology of a studio in Los Angeles to produce a digital replica of Globeleza (Valenssa, “Interview” by Barbosa). To avoid recapping the same kind of image that had already been aired in the previous carnaval season, Donner taped the vignette when she was still in the early stages of her pregnancy (Valenssa, “Interview” by Barbosa). Aired on January 11, 2004, the advertisement displayed a computerized adaptation of her performance. In comparison with previous vignettes, the virtual Globeleza looked highly manufactured, robotic, cartoonish, and stiff, an image that resembles the structure and material on which the concept of Globeleza was built and first aired in 1991. (As described by Donner in his autobiography, Hans Donner e Seu Universo, before Globo assigned a real person for the carnaval advertisement, it used a cardboard design and a stylized mannequin for the commercial).30 Having consistently chosen Afro-Brazilian women to advertise its carnaval programs, Globo fabricated the misconception that women of all races have equal opportunities in the corporation.\n\nAs Valenssa discusses, her role as Globeleza opened some doors for her to pursue entrepreneurial ventures. Complementary to her job as the Globeleza character, she attempted a performative career as a singer and dancer by participating in a show organized by the group É o Tchan, in São Paulo, and joined the show Ela Brasil, in Garden Hall, in Rio de Janeiro (Valenssa, “Interview” by Barbosa; Donner 194; and Bergallo and Duarte 95–103). From 2000 on, Donner designed products stamped with the Globeleza brand—jewelry, a lingerie collection, a video recording, and a calendar—to be sold during the carnaval season (Valenssa, “Interview” by Barbosa).31 In the video recording Aprenda a Dançar Samba com Valéria Valenssa (“Learn How to Dance Samba with Valéria Valenssa”), she introduces herself as “the symbol of Brazilian carnaval” and discusses the process of producing and taping Globeleza’s vignettes. During the footage in which Valenssa gives samba lessons, the video production intertwines her body and dance movements with images of Rio de Janeiro (especially the sinuous patterns of Copacabana and Ipanema sidewalks, and the curvaceous landscape of the city that the Guanabara Bay and the mountains Corcovado and Pão de Açúcar exemplify).32 The connection Donner makes between Valenssa’s body and Rio’s sites is remarkably similar to the associations Caminha presents in his letter to the king of Portugal in 1500 in which gender, race, ethnicity, and sexuality become markers of cultural and ideological spaces. Thus, Donner helped Globo perpetuate its neo-colonial model and economic agenda by selling the images of his wife as the hybrid, sensual mulata, and by collapsing the difference between her (exotic) body and the (tropical) landscape of Rio de Janeiro. When some people in Brazil and abroad criticize him for masterminding the promotion and sale of his wife’s naked images, he justifies and defends his choices. For him, nudity is a beautiful and sensuous enterprise that must be shared. As he explains, Valenssa is not really naked because her skin color works as a sort of formal dress that covers her entire body:\n\nCerta vez, estava com um engraxate na rua, acabando de dar o brilho nos meus sapatos, quando ele me perguntou referindose a Valéria: “Seu Hans, como é que você consegue mostrar sua mulher daquele jeito?” Não é só no Brasil que isto acontece. Jornalistas estrangeiros passam por aqui e, depois de tomar um pouco de intimidade, acabam fazendo a mesma pergunta\n\n… Sinceramente só posso dizer que acho a Valéria tão deslumbrante, que não é justo guardá-la só para mim … A cor da sua pele já é uma vestimenta, um traje de gala.” (180–81)\n\nOnce, I was having my shoes shined when the shoeshine boy asked me a question in reference to Valéria: “Mr. Hans, how do you have the courage to display your wife like that?” It is not just in Brazil that I get this type of question. As soon as foreign journalists who are traveling around here get acquainted with me, they ask me the same question … Honestly speaking, I find Valeria’s beauty so stunning that I do not think it is fair to keep it just for myself … The color of her skin is already a type of clothing, a fancy evening gown.\n\nHis comments indicate that he does not seem to perceive, or chooses to ignore, that by foregrounding Valenssa’s nudity as a symbol of the erotic, exotic, and sexual Afro-Brazilian woman, he is not only denigrating her as a woman but also an entire race category. By weaving her image into a larger ideological complex (the ideology of whitening and the myth of the race democracy), he links gender, race, and identity, and consequently fragments her subjectivity. In attempting to erase Valenssa’s nakedness, Donner’s constructed discursivity creates a reverse effect. By establishing her body and race as emblematic tokens of Brazilian carnaval, and construing Valenssa’s race as a sort of attire, he discloses his perception of race and gender. Such a comment also displays the estranged logic of a white foreigner and his neo-colonial sexualracial politics and establishes a roadmap for the discourse of “otherness” (the different, exotic, and erotic). Hence, metaphorically speaking, Donner has tattooed his Globeleza with the discourse of “the piccaninny” (the other/the conquered),33 and has confined her to the display of a construed sensuality that fits the traditional pattern of a slave-holding mentality.\n\nIn 2005, after Valenssa had played the Globeleza role for more than fourteen years, the network decided to replace her. Although Globo terminated her contract, Valenssa still appeared on the pages of its official site until 2006. During that period, the network kept an interactive site, where visitors could stimulate their voyeuristic cravings by drawing and painting on Valenssa’s virtual, stark-naked body. The digital model moved to the sound of the samba rhythm creating the illusion of an interaction and enticing spectators to clothe her body physically and emotionally. From 2005 on, Globo introduced new faces: Aline Prado, Giane Carvalho, Nayara Justino, and Éricka Moura filled the Globeleza position (Bergallo and Duarte 91, 116). Justino starred as the new Globeleza in 2013, but her term was short-lived (C. Gomes). She believes the network acquiesced to viewers’ complaints that she was “too dark” to play the role, and in the following year a lighter-skinned mulata was selected for the Globeleza position (C. Gomes). This episode reveals “a sliding scale of prejudice”34 and a range of skin color for mulatas. As previously discussed, it also reinforces the concept of “good appearance,” which can function as a measurement during job selection.\n\nIn analyzing the relationship between the field of cultural production and national identity, Jen Webb asserts that “the fragments of the concept of a ‘nation’ can be welded together, at least momentarily, by the representation of ‘us’ in story or performance or visual forms” (157). This is the concept that Globo adopted in 2017, when it changed the Globeleza’s image and, for the first time since 1990, the character wore a costume and danced with other performers who represented several regions of Brazil. The new vignette flashed quick images of folkloric costumes and regional carnaval celebrations and reunited them into the picture of an energetic, beautiful, and centripetal Globeleza surrounded by the regional representations, all dancing to the jingle: “No meio desse povo / A gente vai se ver na Globo” (“In the middle of the people / We will see ourselves in Globo”). In commenting on Globo’s choice to end the era of Globeleza’s nudity in the carnaval vignettes, Valenssa seems nostalgic and saddened because she believes that the beauty of Brazilian women is no longer held in high esteem: “A beleza da mulher brasileira não é mais valorizada” (Extra, n.p.). However, she also acknowledges that carnaval culture has changed and gives Globo credit for adapting to the new reality.\n\nValenssa finds the changes that Globo’s executives made in the carnaval vignette very radical, but she also opines that the network is attempting to catch up with the cultural transformations that have taken place in Brazil in the last decade: “Se essa mudança foi tão radical é que eles também estão tentando acompanhar essas mudanças” (Extra, n.p.). When discussing pursuit of fame, financial gain, success, and her professional mulata ventures, Valenssa does not question Globo’s ulterior motives in casting only Afro-Brazilian women as Globeleza, or her husband’s Svengali behavior. She appears to be content with her mulata career, the financial benefits it brought her, and the spotlight she enjoyed dancing samba on many Brazilian and European stages (Valenssa, “Interview” by Barbosa). She confides that her desire to work as a mulata goes back to her childhood dreams when she aspired to be hired as “Sargentelli’s mulata,” ascend socially, and marry “a blue-eyed man” (Bergallo and Duarte 27–29).35 With regard to the public display of her body, she considers it a type of “artistic nudity” as in visual arts (Valenssa, “Interview” by Barbosa).\n\nAs Valenssa’s comments reveal, she does not seem to realize that globelezas and other “made-in-Brazil mulatas” are tokens of a national identity mistaken for wonders of a racial democracy. Valenssa and the other women who work in the mulata profession find themselves in a no-win situation: the marketing techniques that producers of mulata shows bring them many benefits, but to climb that social and economic ladder they become an object of sexual voyeurism, and a new version of a the colonial mucama. Analyzing the question from a different angle, Valenssa contended that it is also important to consider how difficult it can be to rebuff the opportunity to ascend socially and become well known in the entertainment industry, especially because there are fewer prospects for women of color (Valenssa, “Interview” by Barbosa). She used autobiographical details to make this point and justify her choices, explaining that she was born and raised in Pavuna, an underprivileged neighborhood on the outskirts of Rio de Janeiro, and did not have many opportunities to study or advance socially (Valenssa, “Interview” by Barbosa). As she argued, it is enticing for anyone, regardless of race or gender, to exchange menial jobs, or subservient positions (she worked in telemarketing), for the opportunity to hold high-paying jobs, and to be known far beyond the frontiers of one’s national territory (Valenssa, “Interview” by Barbosa; Bergallo and Duarte 58).\n\nIn her analysis of space, subjectivity, gender, sexuality, and the politics of identity, Kathleen M. Kirby writes that “it is precisely when the space of the body coincides with the space of ideology that [symbolic] violence can occur” (13). However, as she further analyzes, for symbolic violence to occur it needs consent; that is, women must agree to be “woven into a larger ideological complex,” by endorsing the system that “tears apart their subjectivity” and defines them by the surface of their bodies (13). Webb presents a similar analysis of symbolic violence, discussing it as an ancillary form of aggression that is dangerous specifically because it is misrecognized and accepted as something that is natural, or “the way things work” (25). In tandem with Kirby’s and Webb’s theoretical discussions, critics of the mulata profession see it as a form of concealed violence. For instance, in coining and discussing the label and ideological formula “mulata cordial,” Sant’Anna argues that women who agree to have their race and bodies exploited for financial gain contribute to mask racial and social conflicts (Canibalismo 41). Mariza Corrêa adopts a similar point of view to analyze the development of the parda woman’s pride in mestiçagem and uses the term mulatice as a critical way to refer to the attitude of Afro-Brazilian women who embrace the mulata profession uncritically (47–48). Pravaz adopted Corrêa’s neologism to argue that it would be simplistic to interpret those performers as mere victims of an oppressive system, “not only because of the immense delight women take in showcasing their talents, but most importantly because mulatice is understood by many as a source of racial pride itself” (“Brazilian” 133).\n\nWhen Afro-Brazilian women sport the “made-in-Brazil mulata” trademark with pride and zeal, they overlook the fact that those engaged in the creation and development of the mulata profession treat them as commodities. They do not seem to realize that, by endorsing the system that exploits them, they transform their bodies into a one-dimensional paradigm sized to fit into the symbolic map of a mixed-race nation. By uncritically accepting the mulata profession, Valenssa and other Afro-Brazilian women assimilate and endorse that model of exploitation and become complicit with the system that undermines their individuality and denigrates their race and gender. For them, the mulata profession is considered an enviable award, an emblem of power, or a sign of inclusion into the entertainment industry. The females who adopted this profession also have a counterpart in the famous parda women characterized in Brazilian literature and popular songs as symbols of sensuality and sexuality. Their descriptions can be found, for instance, in the poetry of Gregório de Matos e Guerra (1636–1696) whose irreverent and satirical poems spared no social class in Bahia, and reserved for brown Afro-Brazilian women his sharpest criticism because, in his opinion, they were untrustworthy creatures whose unrestrained sexuality and thriving promiscuity could only harm a man (Queiroz Junior 33).36\n\nThe concept of a sensual and unreliable brown Afro-Brazilian woman is repeated in Azevedo’s O Cortiço (“The Slum”).37 Published following the aftermath of the abolition of black slavery in Brazil, the end of the Bragança Monarchy and the proclamation of the Republic, O Cortiço captures social, political, and cultural transitions. It documents the social changes of the time, presents a grim picture of Rio de Janeiro’s urban society, and summarizes the upheavals of a convoluted society and a city swollen by the influx of urban migration (mostly displaced freed slaves and soldiers returning from the Canudos War), and the inflow of European immigrants who were brought to Brazil to replace the black work force. Following the deterministic bent of the time, the text summarizes the best expression of Brazilian Naturalism in its description of the appalling reality of tenement dwelling in a city infested with dire poverty, serious public health issues, and bulging housing problems.38 It focuses on themes of displacement, migration, immigration, racial stereotyping, and prejudice as it presents a variety of characters from different backgrounds, races, and ethnicities. The main character, however, is the tenement itself, a collective entity that exerts a powerful negative influence on all people who dwell in it. The novel presents a stereotypical picture of the mixed-race population of both genders, describing them as flawed human beings. Firmo (the capoeirista) and Rita Baiana (the samba dancer) are represented in the novel as conspicuous examples of Afro-Brazilians who hold an intermediary racial and social position and, because of that, do not pledge alliance to any group. Consequently, their ambiguity and character ambivalence portray them as undeserving of trust (they are intelligent, sensual, and physically attractive, but are also arrogant, unfaithful, selfish, and prone to deceiving). As Barbara Browning discusses (in another context), “the so-called mulato capoeirista is a figure moving between categories. He exists at the anxious point of contact between blacks and whites. And while that point of contact was sexualized in the body of the mulata sambista, it is made violent in that of the capoeirista” (96).\n\nThe mixed population of African descent was often described as people who upheld little or no racial allegiance and withstood low moral standards. As for Afro-Brazilian men, they emblematized untrustworthy individuals who were prone to violent and mean behavior and, therefore, needed to be feared. The gendered perception of race was stigmatized in the image of parda females because they allegedly possessed a bewitching charm and a boundless sexuality as evidenced in the characterization of Rita Baiana. In addition to her conspicuous sensuality and sexuality, Azevedo added a few more ingredients to his formula: Rita Baiana is beautiful, happy, sociable, and dances samba well. Her name also adds a touch of “authenticity” to her racial profile as it refers to someone from Bahia (the cradle of the African diaspora in Brazil), and indirectly connects her to the Afro-Brazilian women described in Matos’s poetry. Thus, Rita Baiana reproduces some of the stereotypes that Matos made popular in the 1700s and establishes new typecasts. Azevedo portrays her as a trickster, someone whose seductive powers and unbridled sexuality sow unrest and stir discord. The combination of those characteristics—which are more noticeable when she dances—ruins the lives of men bewitched by her charm and has a decimating effect on Firmo and Jerônimo (the Portuguese immigrant who leaves his family because of her).\n\nInspired by Azevedo’s character, in 2011, John Neschling and Geraldo Carneiro composed the song, “Rita Baiana,”39 in which they catalogue and inflate a long list of stereotypes associated with her everlasting disposition for sex. While Azevedo’s narrative is told in a third-person narrative voice, Neschling and Carneiro’s song presents a first-person female voice explaining to the man of her affection why she is so voluptuous. The lyric voice describes the overwhelming sexual need that afflicts her as a heavy burden, a form of slavery, a biological trap, an illness triggered by the tropical climate of Rio de Janeiro.\n\nOlha, meu nego,\n\nIsso não dá sossego.\n\nE se não tem chamego,\n\nEu me devoro toda de paixão.\n\nAcho que é o clima feiticeiro,\n\nDo Rio de Janeiro que me\n\nAtormenta o coração.\n\nListen, my dear,\n\nThis feeling gives me no break.\n\nWhen I do not make love,\n\nI burn in passion.\n\nI think it is caused by\n\nRio de Janeiro’s bewitching climate\n\nThat torments my heart.\n\nIn a way, her explanation reproduces the old mentality that it was nearly impossible for a male to resist the sensuality and sexuality of the parda woman because it is so uncontrollable that not even she can tame or avoid it as described in the following verses:\n\nEu nem consigo pensar direito,\n\nCom essa aflição dentro do meu peito.\n\nAi, essa coisa que me desatina,\n\nMe enlouquece, me domina,\n\nMe tortura e me alucina.\n\nE me dá\n\nUma vontade e uma gana dá\n\nUma saudade da cama dá.\n\nQuando a danada me chama\n\nMaldita de Rita Baiana.\n\nI cannot even think straight,\n\n‘Cause I feel so afflicted.\n\nAi, this feeling unhinges me,\n\nIt drives me crazy, it dominates me,\n\nIt tortures me and makes me crazy.\n\nIt gives me\n\nAn uncontrollable desire\n\nAnd a craving for a bed.\n\nWhen this sexual craving calls me\n\nRita Baiana is doomed.\n\nThis song was also recorded and made popular by Zezé Motta, a well-known singer and a distinguished black actor in Brazil. By lending her voice, prestige, and fame to popularize the song, Motta reinforced several stereotypes addressed in the song “Rita Baiana.” Yet, it was not the first time that Motta embraced formulaic roles designed for Afro-Brazilian women. For instance, she played the leading role in the 1976 film Xica da Silva40 which focuses on the life of an Afro-descendant woman named Francisca da Silva de Oliveira, better known as Chica da Silva (1732–1796), who lived in the mining town of Diamantina during the gold and diamond rush. The film caricatures Silva’s life by focusing on her construed bewitching charm, burning sexuality, and her occasional grotesque attitudes and behaviors. A case in point is the refrain of the thematic song (“Xica da, da, da Silva”)41 which is a play on words: da from her name Chica da Silva, and dá from the conjugated form of the verb dar (“to give”). Both words are pronounced the same way and the pun, intended to provoke laughter, reveals the hidden Brazilian discourse of gender and sex. That is, in addition to the traditional meaning it has, in colloquial Brazilian Portuguese the verb dar can also mean the act of willingly consenting to having sexual intercourse. The word da/dá is repeated and thus emphasized throughout the song’s refrain which is played at every sex scene, or when it is suggested that Silva knows some powerful sexual tricks capable of holding any man to her side. The focus on her sexuality submits the idea that her eroticism might have been the only gift she had and the single reason such an influential white man selected her to be his long-term companion.\n\nSilva became the slave and mistress of the richest and most powerful white man of the region who freed her six months later and, disregarding the colonial laws, co-habited openly with her for fifteen years, and helped her raised their thirteen children until he had to move to Portugal for business reasons (Furtado 15–20). In her historical account of Chica da Silva’s life, Júnia Ferreira Furtado questions several myths about her sexual allure by focusing on her sense of empowerment, the attention she gave to her children’s education, and the respect (or fear) she earned as the richest woman in Diamantina. However, as Furtado also mentions, to gain such a prominent place in a slave-driven society, Chica endorsed some of the ideologies of the white society that had enslaved her. She also had African and Afro-Brazilian slaves, adopted manners and values sported by the upper echelons of Diamantina’s society, and used dissimulation to be part of the social circles that had previously scorned her (Furtado 17).\n\nIn a conversation with Henry Louis Gates Jr. in her residence in Rio de Janeiro—when he was filming the documentary Brazil: A Racial Paradise?—Motta described the racist comments she heard when she auditioned for the movie Xica da Silva. She confided to Gates that the producer and/or the director did not want to cast her because she was considered “too black” and not beautiful enough for the part.42 She had to fight hard to play that leading role. Motta also rightly complained about the lack of opportunities for black women to work in cinema and television; however, by accepting the role, or insisting to play parts that depreciate or mischaracterize her peers, Motta reinforced the status quo. The part she played in the film Xica da Silva, and her choice of recording and performing the song “Rita Baiana” during the popular television program Fantástico did not contribute to advance Afro-Brazilian women’s causes. Motta does not seem to realize that the entertainment industry continues casting stereotypical roles exactly because women will compete fiercely to play them.\n\nBut not all are gray areas in terms of race in Brazil. A number of poets and musical groups have adopted a judicious position in reference to the “mulatto escape-hatch,” the parda woman mystique, the “cordial mulata,” and the myth of racial democracy. They reiterate the criticism voiced by activists, cultural anthropologists, historians, and sociologists who often analyze the ambiguous relations of race and gender in Brazil. The poet and anthropologist Edimilson de Almeida Pereira is one of those writers who turned his attention to such topics. For instance, his book-length poem, Caderno de Retorno (“Notebook of a Return”)43 addresses historical silences and revisits individual and collective memories related to the Portuguese colonization and black slavery. The poetic voice connects past and contemporary discourses, and links local and global spaces by analyzing movements of migration, immigration, and slavery. Pereira draws a literary picture that spills beyond Brazil’s frontiers as he reconfigures the social and cultural position of several minorities on the “skin-map” of a globalized world. The following stanza is a catalyst of emotions for the narrative voice and a compass for the reader to navigate the ambiguous characteristics of race relations and the myth of racial democracy in the ambiguous landscape of Brazilian society:\n\nTenho doze anos.\n\nAo entregar a roupa limpa,\n\nme indicam a entrada de serviço\n\nmal iluminada.\n\nO menino deliza o hades das garagens\n\nAdivinha a campaminha em braile.\n\nA cozinha abre a porta\n\n(até quando fará os mesmos gestos?)\n\nsorri recolhe as peças\n\ne mergulha outra vez\n\nno Brasil colonial.\n\nSerá o dublê de mucama que\n\nareou vasilhas\n\nsábados a fio?\n\ne engomou por força o próprio destino?\n\n(Pereira 208)\n\nI am a twelve-year-old delivery boy. When I hand over the clean clothes,\n\nthey point to the poorly lit\n\nservice entrance to me.\n\nThe kid glides through the garage’s darkness\n\nAnd blindly fumbles in search of the bell.\n\nThe cook opens the kitchen door\n\n(until when will she repeat those gestures?)\n\nsmiles and receives the clothes\n\nand once again she recedes\n\ninto colonial Brazil.\n\nCould she be a mucama’s double who\n\nshined dishes\n\nSaturdays on end?\n\nand was obliged to press her own destiny?\n\nThe verses cited above analyze the emotional experiences of a twelve-year-old boy who is entrusted with the task of delivering a bundle of cleaned clothes to one of his parents’ clients. At the front door of the house he is reminded to use the “service entrance” which is located at the back of the house. (The entrada de serviço and elevador de serviço, which a number of critics consider a veiled form of apartheid,44 are ambiguous and ambivalent spaces found in higher-end and middle-class homes and apartment buildings in Brazil.)45 To reach the “service entrance,” he must go through the unlit space of the garage. At this point there is a reference, in lower case, to the mythological Hades (“O menino deliza o hades das garagens”), connecting the dim garage to the underworld and alluding to the dark space of separation between the front and back doors where the “service entrance” is located. The garage suggests not only the physical dark space he has to traverse to reach the “service entrance,” but also the emotional and intellectual crossing he must undergo for his rite of passage to take place (the recognition of social and racial differences). In arriving at the “service entrance,” he looks at the smiley Afro-Brazilian woman who opens the kitchen door and receives the clothes. At that moment, a shift in narrative voice takes place, marking the loss of childhood innocence.\n\nLike a mythological quester, he reaches the zenith of his apprenticeship when—face-to-face with the smiling female servant and her submissive acceptance of her fate—he begins to question the passageways of Brazilian history and the myth of the racial democracy. Pereira conveys this change by having the twelve-year-old poetic voice—which addresses the reader in the first person of discourse at the beginning of the stanza—transmute into an enquirer/narrator who uses the third person of discourse to raise questions about the Brazilian racial and social systems. Pereira compares the role the woman plays as a servant in modern Brazil to how mucamas behaved in the big plantation houses in the colonial past. Bemused by the fact that she looks happy, the adultpoetic voice ends the stanza with incisive questions about how unaware Afro-Brazilian women who work as domestic servants are of their exploitation in the social and economic strata.\n\nIn the poem “Mulher” (“Woman”), Sant’Anna also invites the readers to look at historical facts, this time to evaluate the traditional moral codes and the amalgamation of gender, race, and sexuality in colonial Brazil. He paraphrases a popular saying that associated women’s social and sexual function in the domestic structure, a construct that Freyre discussed in The Masters and the Slaves.46 The following verses elucidate Sant’Anna’s (95) parodic interpretation of it, calling attention to the fact that not much has changed in Brazilian society since then:\n\nLá está ela: como no tempo do avô\n\nnuma tríade exemplar:\n\na mãe preta no eito, a mulata no leito,\n\na mãe branca no lar.\n\nThere she is: just like she was in old times\n\nin a prototypical triad:\n\nthe black woman in the fields,\n\nthe mestizo woman in bed,\n\nthe white mother at home.\n\nA similar revisionist analysis appears in the poem “Passado Histórico” (“Historic Past”) by Sônia Fátima da Conceição in which she questions the racial-sexual-biological generalizations of black and parda women. As the poem illustrates, usually the black woman is not considered sensual or beautiful, and the parda female is mischaracterized as too sensual to be a good worker. She points out the historical silences that disregard the parda woman’s capacity to work and omits that she was also submitted to the rules and punishments of the slave system. Those historical omissions also hide the black female’s physical attractiveness and sex appeal as discussed in “Passado Histórico” (118):\n\nDo açoite\n\nda mulata erótica\n\nda negra boa de eito e de cama\n\n(nenhum registro).\n\nOf the whipping\n\nof the erotic mestizo woman\n\nand the black woman good at working\n\nand in bed\n\n(there are no records).\n\nThe poems by Sant’Anna and Conceição are thematically in sync with Angela Gilliam’s discussion of Freyre’s theoretical views about the contribution women of color have given to Brazilian society. In her critique of Freyre, Gilliam sees “the need to visualize the burden of slavery from the perspective of the slave woman,” and labels his concept of mestiçagem “the-Great-Sperm-Theory-of-Nation-Formation” because she believes Freyre “degrades the Afro-Brazilian women by postulating their roles as perennial sex objects” (“Women’s” 226–27).\n\nTinkering with two different voices, in the poem/song “Mulata Exportação” (“Made-in-Brazil Mulata”), Elisa Lucinda also captures and highlights some paradoxes of Brazilian history and culture. Using a call and response technique, the two poetic voices establish a contrastive tone between past/present, male/female, and white master/black slave. Even though the text is, at times, structured as a discursive play of thesis and antithesis, the message it conveys goes beyond a mere set of oppositions because it also highlights historical intersections, social interplays, and the struggles of forces that those conflicts reflect and/or describe. The first part of the poem is told from a slave-owner mentality and a male-controled point of view that pokes fun not only at women, but also at any type of Afro-Brazilian resistance. For instance, the male voice ridicules the cultural opposition the malês47 represented in Bahia, from 1827 to 1831, when they organized insurrections, openly challenging Catholicism and the slaveholding system. The following fragments of the first part of the poem corroborate such readings:\n\nRebola meu bem-querer\n\nQue eu sou seu improviso\n\nSeu karaoquê\n\n[…]\n\nVem ser meu folklore,\n\nVem ser minha tese, Sobre nego malê.\n\nSwing your hips, honey\n\nFor I am your improvisation,\n\nYour karaoke.\n\n[…]\n\nCome be my folklore,\n\nCome be my thesis,\n\nOn Afro-Brazilian malês.\n\nIn the second part of the poem, Lucinda emphasizes the complex and ambivalent position that race, gender, sexuality, and sensuality have acquired in Brazil. Embodied by a female voice, this segment offsets the male ideological position by presenting a counter-discourse that questions the general perception of Afro-Brazilian women as products owned, bought, or sold as sexual objects. In the second part of “Mulata Exportação,” the poetic voice warns that the injustices of the slave system cannot be erased in modern-day by simply hiring a parda woman to dance samba in cultural shows, night clubs, or to play stereotypical roles on television or in cinema:\n\nOlha aqui, meu senhor:\n\nEu me lembro da senzala\n\nE tu te lembras da casa grande.\n\nVamos juntos, sinceramente,\n\nEscrever outra história.\n\nDigo, repito e não minto:\n\nVamos passar essa verdade a limpo\n\nPorque não é dançando samba\n\nQue eu te redimo ou te acredito.\n\nHear me out, sir:\n\nI remember the slave quarters\n\nYou remember the plantation house.\n\nLet’s together, in an honest way,\n\nRewrite history.\n\nI say it, I repeat, and I do not lie:\n\nLet’s be clear about something\n\nIt is not dancing samba\n\nThat I redeem or believe you.\n\nBrazilians’ heightened awareness of their sensuality and sexuality adds captivating liveliness and joie-de-vivre to their lifestyle, yet it also helps promote a superficial image of the country (which the mulata profession epitomizes). The song “Mucama,” released in 1994 by the musical group Cidade Negra,48 examines some of these aspects. To draw a comparison with the behavior of mucamas, it analyzes how Afro-Brazilians (male and female alike) appear to be unaware of how exploited they are. The lyrics of the song compare the discrimination Afro-Brazilians undergo in modern days to the way slave owners treated Africans and their descendants. However, the lyrics of the song also stress their co-optation with the system that exploits them. The song berates Afro-Brazilians for assimilating ideas, moral codes, patterns of behavior, and values steeped in the colonial ideological paradigm. It censures them for appearing to be satisfied with the cultural norms and social system as long as they can watch television, participate in carnaval festivities, dance in cultural shows, function as sexual toys, or accept the position of provisional icons of a cultural identity. In addressing the role the parda women have in this cultural scenario, the lyrics of the song criticize them for endorsing practices that subjugate them (for instance, the fierce competition to play the Globeleza character).49 The song criticizes both the promoters and the performers who are involved in the ambivalent form of inclusion of mulatas into the national imaginary as sexual symbols, and their exclusion from other significant aspects of Brazilian cultural identity. It censures all of those who engage in, endorse, and foster the consumption of women’s bodies as advertising tools or consumer goods, as the following verses reveal:\n\nMucama na cama do patrão\n\nMe chama, me chama de negão:\n\nPaga salário de pão,\n\nMas come o que a população\n\nNão come.\n\nO que se espera de uma nação\n\nQue o heroi é a televisão?\n\nQue passa todos os seus meses mal,\n\nMelhora tudo no Carnaval?\n\nEu só vou te usar,\n\nVocê não é pra mim,\n\nJá temos outra pra botar no teu lugar.\n\nPirlimpimpim!\n\n(Cidade Negra, faixa 1)\n\nMucama in the boss’s bed\n\nCall me “big black”\n\nThe pay is chicken feed,\n\nBut the boss eats what\n\nThe crowd does not.\n\nWhat can be expected of a nation\n\nIn which the hero is a television set? I\n\nt suffers during the whole the year,\n\nAnd everything gets better during carnaval?\n\nI am just going to use you,\n\nYou are not good enough for me,\n\nWe already have another one to replace you. Pirlimpimpim!\n\nThe rap part of the song addresses the Afro-Brazilian working class whose dreams of social and economic growth only materialize in carnaval costumes, music, and dance. It characterizes the Afro-Brazilian population as a type of lady-in-waiting and a slave mistress (mucama) who continues to be exploited but seems content to abide by the rules: “E o povo-mucama continua sorrindo.” The song also reveals that the “made-in-Brazil mulata” concept masks domination and stigmatization, and the mulata profession is a concession made to the patriarchal ideology and a slaveholding mentality. The criticism about the passive attitude of the Afro-Brazilian population is most evident when the poetic voice censures them for their lack of social ambition and higher aspirations, and for accepting scraps of food, small pieces of land, and stray bullets, clear references to the dire violence so prominent in the shantytowns of urban centers in Brazil.\n\nMucama que nada exclama,\n\nQue não se inflama,\n\nQue não reclama,\n\nE se acalma vendo novela.\n\nMucama who does not say anything, Who does not get upset,\n\nWho does not complain,\n\nAnd calms down watching telenovelas.\n\nIn 2002, the rap artist Nega Gizza (Gisele Gomes de Souza) released the album Na Humildade (“In Humility”) in which she addresses questions related to race, citizenship, division of wealth, violence, gender, and the myth of a racial democracy. Nega Gizza is a resident of a favela ironically named Parque Esperança because it is a place where there is no park or hope. The first song of the album, titled “Filme de Terror” (“Horror Movie”), presents a litany of problems that afflict the impoverished and (mostly) black and pardo population of Brazil (poverty, hunger, lack of decent housing, violence in the favelas, and empty promises by politicians). It also lists police persecution and brutality, a staggering division of wealth, separation of physical and social space (the rich people live near the beaches and the poor up on the hills). As Frederick Moehn has analyzed the thematic contents of Na Humildade, “her album presents a black woman favela resident’s perpective on rap, race, class, miscegenation and Brazilian citizenship. It is a subject position she regards as alienated by the discourse of miscegenation, and deprived of the full complement of rights associated with modern citizenship in the West” (116). The first lines of the song sarcastically introduce stereotypes of a tropical and carefree mixed-race country and establish a dialogue with the songs and poems previously mentioned:\n\nPaís da democraca racial\n\nDa mulata exportação\n\nBrasil! nação feliz, um país tropical\n\nPaís da pedofilia, futebol e carnaval\n\nBrasil que nos condena a viver\n\nComo animal irracional\n\nVamos fingir que vai passar\n\nVamos fingir que é natural.\n\nCountry of racial democracy\n\nOf the made-in-Brazil mulata\n\nBrazil! happy nation, a tropical country\n\nCounty of pedophilia, soccer and carnaval\n\nBrasil that condemns us to live\n\nAs irrational animals\n\nLet’s pretend it will go away\n\nLet’s pretend it is natural.\n\nAs the examples discussed reveal, revisionist poets, composers, and activists address stereotypes, historical omissions, taxonomies, social immobility, and paradoxes that feed into the ambiguous racial system in Brazil. Their texts illustrate that they often work hand-in-hand with historians, cultural anthropologists, and sociologists to review assumptions, question misleading concepts, and debunk the idea of a Brazilian harmonious synthesis of racial diversity. In a number of ways those texts reveal hidden conflicts and uneven layers of society. The poems and songs discussed in this chapter also criticize Afro-Brazilian women for partaking in the exploitative enterprise that contributes to stigmatize Brazil as a country of erotic utopia. They illustrate the efforts made to raise awareness in the Afro-Brazilian population, in general, and women in particular, about the dangers of becoming symbolic representations of a national identity. Their criticism also reiterates Renato Ortiz’s discussion that, if the idea of a mixed-race Brazil presumably makes it possible for everyone to recognize each other as part of a national identity, it also conceals racial conflicts by acting as an ideological formula that slackens national consciousness (Cultura 44, 94). Ortiz construes that the ideology of syncretism, which mestiçagem and the concept of a racial democracy symbolize, masks stratified class and race divisions and presupposes the idea of a society where conflicting relations of power do not exist (Cultura 95). And, as is examined in the following chapter, no other Brazilian cultural manifestation can translate the image of a country where those conflicting relations of power are downplayed to a minimum than soccer."
