        "text": "Introduction\n\nJust as Olórun represents the principle of generic existence, Èsù is the principle of differentiated existence in consequence of his function as a dynamic element that leads him to propel, develop, mobilize, grow, transform, and communicate.\n\n4As Èsù is a differential principle, “[...] a dialogic and mediator between Western and African mythemes” (Martins, 1995, p. 56), we reinforce its importance as a symbolic operator in this article, as a dynamic propeller in the diffusion of Afro-Brazilian civilizational values, especially those of ancestry. Philosophically, Èsú plays a fundamental role in safeguarding African memory, both in Africa and in the diasporic region and, therefore, in the dissemination of Afro-oriented and Black-referenced narratives.\n\n7The dichotomous gaze focused on history versus memory, theory versus practice, and writing versus orality has contributed to the perpetuation of the binarism typical of the positivist mode of thinking about knowledge, whose perspective categorically delegitimizes the plurality of ways of preserving memory. In the context of African and Afro-diasporic cultures, therefore, also in the context of Brazilian culture, Martins (2003) states that:\n\nAs wind, breath, diction, and performative event, the spoken and sung word is written in the performance of the body, portal of wisdom. As an index of knowledge, the word is not petrified in a static deposit or archive, but is, essentially, kinesis, dynamic movement, and requires attentive listening, since it refers to a poiesis of the performative memory of sacred songs and lines sung in the context of rituals. The study of this textuality highlights the inscription of African memory in Brazil in various domains: in the bundles of poetic and rhythmic forms and in the aesthetic and cognitive procedures founded on other modulations of creative experience; in the techniques and genres of textual composition; in the methods and procedures of safeguarding and transmitting knowledge; in the instrumental attributes and properties of the performances in which the body that dances, vocalizes, performs, composes, writes (Martins, 2003, p. 67).\n\n10By ignoring the writing of the Black body in the social spaces of power, relegating it to invisibility, we reject the various hypotheses that view corporeality as a document also produced by gesturality, producer of body techniques that express the ancestral heritage of the African matrix, thus, Black identity(ies). Orality, in this sense, is taken as an ancestral African foundation for the construction of knowledge (Alves Neto, 2019).\n\n11As such, bearing in mind orality as a method of disseminating knowledge, listening was used as a procedure to carry out the research into artistic and pedagogical practices in Afro-Gaúcha Dance. In this sense, it is worth reflecting on the concept of oral tradition proposed by Hampantê Bâ (2010), since it presents aspects of how the African tradition spreads possibilities and ways of thinking about orality as an African civilizing value, available as a methodological resource for learning about ancestrality in the territories of the Black Diaspora. According to Bâ (2010, p. 169):\n\nThe oral tradition is the grand scale of life, and retrieves and relates all aspects of it. It may seem chaotic to those who remain unaware of its secret, and employ the Cartesian mentality used to separating everything into well-defined categories. Within the oral tradition, in fact, the spiritual and the material are not dissociated. By moving from the esoteric to the exoteric, oral tradition manages to put itself within the reach of men, speaking to them according to human understanding, and revealing itself according to human aptitudes. It is at once religion, knowledge, natural science, art initiation, history, amusement, and recreation, since every detail always allows us to go back to the primordial unity.\n\nMaestra Iara and the Dance\n\n13Maria Iara Santos Deodoro was born on September 25, 1955, daughter of Verônica da Silva Santos, known as Tia Lili, and of Vilson Santos. She grew up in the Petrópolis neighborhood, in Porto Alegre-RS, surrounded by her two biological sisters and an adopted brother. At the age of four, she lost her father.\n\n14Eager to keep the family together, her mother took on the responsibilities of motherhood alone. For this reason, Verônica dos Santos, Tia Lili, dedicated herself to work, and for a long time served as a cook, eventually becoming a famous chef for the Jewish bourgeoisie in Porto Alegre. Hoping to guarantee a quality education for her daughters and to be able to work calmly, in relation to the safety and well-being of the children in her care, Tia Lili began to look for scholarship opportunities in private schools around the city.\n\nShe (Tia Lili) created a protection system for us, especially for me being the youngest, so my middle sister, when I was four and she was eight, she was responsible for me. So she had to take care of my needs. My mother would leave home early and only come back late, because she worked in a family home and then in a restaurant, and then at night she would come home with lots of things, loads of food, and our house became an all-female house, and we were four women! (Deodoro, 2018).\n\n16Within a private school context, mostly attended by white people, Maestra Iara claims that she did not feel prejudice in her childhood. “If I did, and probably should have, I didn’t realize it. Nowadays, racism is much more aggressive” (Deodoro, 2018).\n\n17Education in Brazil, specifically in the period referring to the second half of the 20th century, does not discuss the social conflicts and inequalities resulting from racism, which structures the organization of Brazilian society. School is also marked by a theoretical line that tries to spread the idea that Brazil lives in a racial democracy, and the Brazilian educational system adheres to and spreads this discourse on racial equality, masking racism in ambiguous declarations. Schools refused to discuss the real conditions of subordination and social exclusion bequeathed to the Black population before and after May 13, 1888, when Law 3.353/1888, known as the Lei Áurea (Golden Law), was enacted (Gomes, 2017).\n\n18As a teenager, Maestra Iara practiced Olympic gymnastics at SOGIPA (the Porto Alegre Gymnastics Society). The group was strongly influenced both by the movements that sought to catalog the traditional expressions of gaucho culture, with a focus on dance, and on the media culture of the time. The songs that played on local radio stations, which were on the soundtracks of international movies, besides being used for warm-up and body preparation, served as a theme for Ms. Nilva Pinto’s creations. The performances on soap operas and in the movies, as well as artistic gymnastics, strongly influenced the group’s work (Alves Neto, 2019).\n\nShe created a dance that was a rehash of an Umbanda session; we had white clothes with a cloth tied around us, I was the only Black person in the group, but it was a well-executed choreography, a patchwork of things that she noticed from the ritual (Deodoro, 2018).\n\n20Besides teaching at Colégio Santa Inês in 1974, Ms. Nilva Pinto also taught dance classes at Colégio Anchieta in Porto Alegre. The classes got to know each other and the greatest differential of the dance group from Colégio Anchieta was dancing to live music, produced by the school choir.\n\n21In the group of instrumentalists that accompanied the choir, there was a young Black man named Marco Aurélio Faria, known as Maestro. Maestra Iara recounts that:\n\nThe group from Colegio Anchieta danced with the choir. The choir sang. There was a choir and a band. And in the band, there was a boy. He was the only Black kid there. I was the only Black girl here. We joined together, right! We joined forces, instinctively. And then Marco, along with his friends, including Paulinho, started to do this thing that is AfroSul. But it was only music. The kids started researching Black music. At that time, there was a very well-known African band, Osibisa. They listened to that sound and found it very familiar to them. And then they went to take part in a festival at Rosário High School, a student festival (Alves Neto, 2019).\n\n22Interested in researching African and Afro-diasporic musical aesthetics, marked by the anti-racism discussion, the young Marco Faria got together with some friends and proposed the composition of a protest-music that would address the racial issues in the Brazilian context. The song Pergunta was born, composed to be released in a student music festival that was to take place in the Colégio Marista do Rosário amphitheater, in Porto Alegre-RS. With the intention of producing a complete artistic performance for the presentation, the musicians decided to invite the young dancer, Iara Deodoro, and four other dancers to comprise the group.\n\n23The song composed by Maestro Marco Farias, in 1974, loosely translated as: I want an intelligent answer to calm myself down/What did my grandfather do wrong to make this happen?/ Sometimes I walk through the crowded street and you can’t look at me/You never tried to listen to me or understand me/Why do you think you are more?/I will cool my head down like my ancestors/I will offer you an agreement where we will all be equal/because.../ After life there is more and you don’t know.\n\n24During this period, Maestra Iara joined the group, which was renamed Afro-Sul. Since its creation in 1974, the group has been active, functioning as a powerhouse in the teaching and creation of Afro-Brazilian dances and music in southern Brazil. Her joining the group was fundamental for the young dancer to carry out artistic research in a collaborative manner, which later helped in the creation of her choreographic works and grounded her teaching method in Black Dances. These points encouraged the creation of Afro-Gaúcha Dance, bringing a particular accent to dance in Rio Grande do Sul, which reaffirms the presence of Black culture, from the African matrix, documented in bodies.\n\nA piece of Africa in the South\n\n27The space remains as the headquarters of the group and is strengthened as an urban ‘quilombo’, a ‘terreiro’. Sodré (1988, p. 54) points out that the ‘terreiro’ does not intend “[...] to exclude the partners in the game (whites, mixed race, etc.) nor to reject the local landscape, but to enable the practice of an exiled cosmovision”, because “[...] culture was not made there as a demonstration effect, but as a vital reconstruction to encourage a continuity that generates identity” (Sodré, 1988, p. 54).\n\n28This cultural settlement at the crossroads of knowledge between Africa and Rio Grande do Sul is a territory that emanates ancestral African and Afro-Brazilian knowledge in its colors, sounds and gestures of resistance in the midst of the urban geography of Rio Grande do Sul’s capital city. Knowing more about that space demanded an awareness of the history of struggles waged since the 1970s by Black artists in movement, engaged in creating life possibilities through art. Here, dance appears as a symbol of resistance that constitutes organized entities within the Black Social Movement struggling for equality and social justice. Corporeality is the language for manifestos about ancestry, among other Afro-Brazilian civilizational values. As Amélia Conrado (2006, 2018) explains, in the 1970s, groups emerged in Brazil that provided visibility and legitimacy to Black culture through dance and music, such as Núcleo Cultural Afro-Brasileiro, Sociedade Malê Cultura and Arte Negra, Grupo Negô, Grupo de Teatro Palmares Inarone, and the Afro-Brazilian Blocks, such as Ilê Aiyê, all of them in Bahia. In Pernambuco, the Balé Popular do Recife was founded. It is at this moment of national reaffirmation of the Black presence that Grupo Afro-Sul de Música e Dança emerges in 1974. Other organized entities, such as Sociedade Cultural Floresta Aurora and Sociedade Satélite Prontidão were part of this movement for the promotion, affirmation and legitimization of Black culture in the state.\n\n29Since the 1980s, artistic and cultural activities have been developed in the Afro-Sul space. From percussion classes, with teachers and masters from Porto Alegre and Africa, to regular Afro-Gaúcha Dance classes with Maestra Iara, as well as an event called Cultural Sunday and charity ‘feijoadas’, among other actions that give the space the status of a Cultural Point recognized by the Ministry of Culture (MinC). The engaged, militant and poetic artistic-pedagogical practices operate in the political dimension through gesture, whether in music or dance, just as the group did on their debut at the music festival in 1974 (Martins, 2016).\n\nBlack Insurgency to the sound of the drum\n\n30The 1970s, the period in which Grupo Afro-Sul de Música e Dança (Afro-Sul Music and Dance Group) was founded, is marked by the struggle of social movements against the political regime that curtailed the rights historically achieved by the Brazilian population. In this period, organized groups from the Black Social Movement emerged in several cities in Brazil. Below are some references to contextualize the historical moment of the debate about ethno-racial relations led by the movement of Black people engaged in the anti-racist and anti-colonial struggle, which exerted an important influence on the national and local scene in the second half of the 20th century.\n\n31The emergence of the Movimento Negro Moderno (Modern Black Movement) in the 1970s is the result of the learning and political movements undergone in the first half of the 20th century. Among them are actions in the urban space, marked above all by recurrent political demands dating back to the post-abolition period in Brazil. Education has always been one of the central themes, debated in order to demand reparation for the long period of slavery. However, the State remained insensitive to the situation of the Brazilian Black population. In 1929, the first Congress of Black Youth was announced, but it didn’t take place. One of the relevant agendas for the event was access for the Black population to the public education system (Pereira, 2010).\n\n32It is important to mention the Frente Negra Brasileira (Brazilian Black Front - FNB), based in São Paulo and organized around 1930, which was active in the construction of public debate about the Black population and the world of work. The group intended to build public policies that would safeguard the right of the Black population to join the Civil Guard of São Paulo, consequently setting a precedent for the entry of Black people into other spaces in the workplace (Pereira, 2010).\n\n33This history of struggles continues to develop and certain groups continue to move politically through artistic practices, presentations of performances, drawing or other arts. This use of Afro-oriented language deserves to be highlighted in the history of the Arts and represents a major contribution to consolidating the Black Social Movement on a national level. Below, we present some examples of groups that articulate the performing language and Afro-centered political movements and others that advance the political conversation, without being linked to artistic movements. In addition, we correlate the historical period that is the background for these political and/or artistic actions.\n\n35In several cities in Rio Grande do Sul, Black Social Clubs were created, especially between the end of the 19th century and the beginning of the 20th century. It is worth noting that these clubs were not exclusive to Black people, but were run by Black communities and welcomed people of different ethnic-racial identities. The Black Social Clubs are important territories of sociability, education and resistance in the antiracist struggle. They are powerful centers of networking and Black political training, necessary to confront the hardships resulting from the way in which racism operated in Rio Grande do Sul (Nunes, 2016). Around the 1970s, the modern Black movement emerges, which is characterized by the affirmation of a Black identity as a way to negotiate the integration of Brazilian society. These modern groups erupt with issues guided by movements prior to this decade. Groups like the Frente Negra (Black Front), União dos Homens de Cor (Colored Men’s Union), among other Black spaces, assumed a “[...] nationalist ideology of integration and assimilation, leaving the defense of African cultural forms out of this mobilization” (Guimarães, 1999 apud Campos, 2006).\n\n36In the face of the recession experienced during the Military Dictatorship (1964-1988), Institutional Act 5 (AI-5), issued by President Arthur da Costa e Silva on December 13, 1968, was a milestone in the trajectory of this generation that created political strategies through the educational power of Art because, besides suppressing the legislative branch, resulting in the loss of parliamentary mandate for those opposed to the military dictatorship, AI-5 legitimized measures to control artistic and cultural production in Brazil through interventions carried out by the Department of Political and Social Order (DOPS).\n\n37The main characteristic that marked the Black movement during the republican period, the New State and the beginning of the civil-military dictatorship was the focus placed on claims about the inclusion of blacks in society through access to education and the labor market (Pereira, 2011) since, at that time, few Black people were able to become literate, attend training courses or work in the labor market with pay equivalent to that of a white person in the same position. The labor market restricted the Black presence, a reflection of the racist ideology permeated systemically in Brazilian society at the time.\n\n38Another outstanding group emerged in 1971, in the city of Porto Alegre: the Palmares Group, created by young university students and led by the poet and professor Oliveira Silveira. The group was responsible for organizing November 20 as Black Consciousness Day, in honor of the quilombola leader Zumbi dos Palmares (1655-1695). The proposal opposed the commemoration of the abolition of slavery, which occurred on May 13, 1888, in reference to the enactment of Law No. 3,353 of 1888. The justification for the change was based on criticism of the lack of guarantee for fundamental rights and the marginalization of the Black population in the post-abolition period (Campos, 2006).\n\nResolved to seek alternatives to May 13, Oliveira Silveira, Antônio Carlos Cortes, Ilmo Silva and Vilmar Nunes held some discussions at Andradas about the lack of other references to blacks in official history. Based on this observation, they decided to research dates that could be representative for Black people. A magazine from the collection Grandes Personagens da História (Great Characters from History), published by Editora Abril, about the figure of Zumbi dos Palmares, caught the group’s attention. This was a strong reference because he was a libertarian character, not a liberated one. At the same time, the resistance history of Palmares was recognized, albeit unofficially, as a landmark of the Black presence in Brazil (Campos, 2006, p. 51).\n\n39Since then, November 20th has been celebrated as Black Awareness Day, in reference to the assassination of Zumbi dos Palmares, which occurred on November 20, 1695. Besides including November 20 in the national calendar, the Palmares Group (RS) was one of the precursors in including the agenda of building a new Black identity, referenced in global and local aspects, since the political debate on the importance of Africanity was latent. In this regard, the work of Oliveira Silveira is noteworthy for featuring the theme as a central and extremely relevant point in his poetics, to the point of later becoming known as the Poet of Black Awareness. Oliveira Silveira (2021) stated that, for the Black population and for the Black movements, Black Awareness meant “[...] the search for a knowledge about ourselves”.\n\n40The political action of the poet Oliveira Silveira and other militants from Rio Grande do Sul engaged in the anti-racism struggle in the 1960s and 1970s made the country realize that there are Black men and women in Rio Grande do Sul, especially in terms of raising fundamental political and artistic issues for the emancipation of Black body-subjects in Brazil and, simultaneously, resisting and challenging the privileges of the whiteness that reside in the state with the largest number of European colonies in Brazil.\n\n41Since the foundation of Afro-Sul, in 1974, the members have played a leading role in the development of research focused on African and Afro-Brazilian art and culture, especially in the study of performances that intersect music and dance, evident in the body-drum relationship. The territory promotes real encounters between people interested in (some measure of) dialogue about racial issues that plague the Black Brazilian population. These gatherings, accompanied by dance executed in soft and strong gestures, cadenced by contractions, which are present in the technique developed by Maestra Iara, take on a political-aesthetic character. In a definition of territory Sodré (1988) says:\n\nTerritory and its sociocultural articulations appear as a dynamic category of their own, irreducible to representations that turn it into a pure receptacle of forms and meanings. This dimension encourages the production of thinking that seeks to discern the movements of circulation and contact between groups and in which spaces emerge not as autonomous data, strictly determinant, but as a vector of their own effects, capable of impacting the conditions for the effectiveness of certain human actions (Sodré, 1988, p. 15).\n\n43The artistic-pedagogical actions developed by Grupo Afro-Sul are many, and take place according to the institutional schedule. Usually, they are open to the general public, or inside the kitchen, in the intervals between classes, rehearsals, or during long hours of conversation that focus on topics ranging from techniques for preparing a good ‘feijoada’ to analyses of the international political situation. These actions promote the diffusion of Afro-Brazilian civilizational values, as well as indicate the historical disparities revealed by racism and point out strategies for the fight against racism, both in the local and global contexts, implementing channels for an education in ethno-racial relations through art. This is made possible through the efforts of Maestra Iara in promoting artistic-pedagogical practices that explicitly link the techniques and poetics of Black Dances to Afro-Brazilian civilizational values.\n\n44Over the course of 30 years, Maestra Iara has been working on the grounding of her own pedagogy, which is constantly changing and is known by her students as Pedagogia da Bagunça (Pedagogy of the Mess). Markedly feminist and anti-racist, her pedagogy assumes that the power of anti-racist education lies in the gestures taught and learned in dance and percussion classes.\n\n45The relationship between body, drum, and ancestral memory is exalted in the dances of Black expression and aesthetics, whether in sacred rituals or artistic creations. According to Maestra Iara (Alves Neto, 2019), listening to the drum was one of the first procedures she experimented with for the creation of her artistic and pedagogical work. The polyrhythm present in the language of the beats was embodied and translated into dance. As a creator in Black Dances, the language of the drum was a fundamental element in the experience of accessing and strengthening her ancestral memory, in and through the body.\n\n47These choreographies present unsubmissive Black corporealities that through their poetics foment strategies for social emancipation. Besides being a dancer, Maestra Iara is a trailblazer in the production of an aesthetic-corporal contribution of an anti-racist and decolonial political nature in the field of the Performing Arts, particularly in dance, in the capital of Rio Grande do Sul.\n\n48The poet Oliveira Silveira had fraternal ties with members of the Grupo Afro-Sul and, when questioned by Maestra Iara, who felt removed from the bureaucratic routines of meetings held by groups of intellectuals from the Black movement, Oliveira Silveira affectionately attested to the importance of the dance know-how developed by the teacher in the fight against racism, as a means of developing Black awareness. Oliveira Silveira reinforced that arts education is a legitimate place for Black activism, since Black bodies in movement unveiled a political-aesthetic thought-action based on Afro-Brazilian civilizing values. These values underpin her artistic-pedagogical proposal to stimulate an effective political debate on ethno-racial relations in dance (Deodoro, 2018).\n\nConsiderations for other final gestures\n\nMemory is the content of a continent, of its life, its history, and its past, as if the body were the document. It is no wonder that dance, for Black people, is a moment of liberation. The Black man cannot be free until he forgets, through gesture, that he is no longer a captive (Nascimento, 1989).\n\n49The Black Brazilian intellectual Muniz Sodré (1988) points out that European colonization also occurred through attacks in the semantic field. This implies considering that several symbolic relations of the order of knowing and doing, in relation to the African ethos, the arche, the memories anchored in the body, the gesture, the orality and other materialities of info-communicational competence were aggressively submitted to invisibility by the modern-colonial world system.\n\n50We reiterate that certain justifications used by the academic canons emphasized a supposed illiteracy in Black African and Afro-diasporic cultures, and this discourse is reinforced by our contemporaries who ignore and delegitimize orality, gesture, and the body as possibilities for memory writing. For the authors Serrano and Waldman:\n\nThe adoption of orality by many African peoples ended up being used as a sign of illiteracy. It should be recognized that the expression ‘illiteracy’ makes no sense for certain African peoples, because their cultural choices have always enabled efficient communication, even dispensing with the written word in many contexts. (Serrano; Waldman, 2007, p. 95).\n\n51Regarding the literacy of Black men and women in Brazilian Portuguese, one example is the historiographical data about the creation of several newspapers (printed) whose editorial staff was composed entirely of Black men and women in the first years after the abolition of slavery in 1888. There are records that report the existence of actions of this nature since the mid-19th century, during the slavery period in the country, in which Black men popularized anti-racist discourses through writing made possible by the profession of typographer (Oliveira, 2017).\n\n52Historically, the legacy of Africanity in Brazil has been erased, not only in the South, but throughout all the routes of the communities once enslaved and dispersed in the process of the African Diaspora. The presence of the Black population in the most diverse fields of knowledge intends to recognize this presence.\n\n53The presence of resistance gestures, especially in the context of the history written in dance by Maestra Iara intends to contribute to the recognition of the diversity of Black authorship in the field of Black Dances and, thus, to consolidate the proposition, in the social space, of performative actions that are intimately linked to Black and affirmative political discursiveness. This form of existence and resistance articulates counter-hegemonic narrative possibilities. I return to the understanding of gesture as a visual materiality that creates clouds of meaning (Gil, 2004) that write discourses on lived experience in the world. Such an interpretation recalls valuable contributions by the celebrated Black poet and historian Beatriz Nascimento (1942-1995), who points to memory as the content of a continent, a formative corporeality in the writing of the body in the world and, above all, announces dance as a space of liberation."
