        "text": "Deep inequalities from structural racism continue to permeate every aspect of Brazilian society, including its education system. These inequalities prevent Black, Indigenous and Quilombola learners from accessing opportunities that help them gain economic mobility. As a result of these barriers, they experience lower learning and life outcomes compared to their more privileged, white peers. Within larger communities, this has led to a significant underrepresentation of leaders in positions of power, and an underinvestment of their organizations and ideas. In recent years, the global pandemic and political instability have compounded these inequalities and made these challenges more dire. Through co-creation with our partners, we believe that philanthropy can play a stronger role in creating a more equitable and just future in Brazil."
