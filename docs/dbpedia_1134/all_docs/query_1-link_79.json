        "text": "The Tropicália movement (1967–1969) appeared to represent a radical break away from popular music tradition in Brazil, its heterogeneous, irreverent aesthetic seen as retrograde to Brazil’s struggle for cultural autonomy. This dissertation intends to demonstrate the authenticity of Tropicália as a Brazilian music by situating it in a number of Brazilian cultural traditions. My argument will focus on Tropicália’s use of ‘cultural cannibalism’, a Brazilian modernist method of constructing cultural identity by way of ‘devouring’ the cultures of others. Ultimately, by drawing attention to Tropicália’s heterogeneous and chaotic reflection of Brazilian society, this dissertation aims to expose the inauthenticity of nationalist essentialisations of Brazilian popular music.\n\nThroughout the last century, linkages between music and race show how rhythm, melody, harmony, and dissonance have been ever-present as Brazilians negotiate their physical and symbolic places in society. This article focuses on just two intersections of race and music in Brazil: the transformation of samba from localized sound to national music, and the creation and subsequent global commercial success of samba-reggae. This analysis should inform any situation where music or any other social/cultural form are both present in the ongoing (re)creation of cultural identity and simultaneously a force used for explicit political or economic gain.\n\nLocated in the eastern Brazilian Amazon roughly three hours by boat from the open Atlantic, the port city of Belém do Pará has been an important point of convergence for transnational flows of commodities, people, and culture, including a vast array of up-tempo Caribbean dance genres known locally as lambada. Since the late twentieth century, inhabitants of Belém and surrounding areas have sought to make a virtue of their liminal position between the hegemonic centers of southeastern Brazil and the circum-Caribbean. This article shows how musicians, dancers, listeners, and culture brokers draw on the local history of Caribbean cosmopolitan musicality to articulate an alternative Amazonian regional identity, one characterized by connectedness and proximity to their Caribbean neighbors rather than by isolation and provincialism. In so doing, the article contributes to the remapping of the cultural contours of Brazil, the Caribbean, the Amazon, and Latin America.\n\nShohat and Stam put forward the idea of a Tropical Orientalism in Brazil. They interpret the contemporary Brazilian imaginary of the orient against the backdrop of a Moorish-Sephardi unconscious, thus highlighting not only the positive cross-Atlantic historical, discursive, and cultural links between \"the Orient\" and \"the Occident,\" but also the anxieties that such links provoked."
