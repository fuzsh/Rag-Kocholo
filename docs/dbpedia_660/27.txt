History

Westfield Heritage Village was established by two Brantford, Ontario high schoolteachers in 1961 who purchased land near Rockton, Ontario, using their own money. Their goal was to save heritage buildings that were in danger of being destroyed and also to create a hands-on educational facility to teach pioneer life. The original name of the facility was the Westfield Pioneer Village until 1981 when the name was changed to Westfield Heritage Village as much of the collection was not actually of the pioneer era.
