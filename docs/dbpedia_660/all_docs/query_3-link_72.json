St James is full of wonderful information about the Yorkshire Wolds, its history, landscape, villages, walks and places to visit, as well as some of the most beautiful stained glass. Warter is a village and civil parish in the East Riding of Yorkshire. Situated approximately 4 miles east of Pocklington. It is the location for Warter Priory which was an Augustine Priory dedicated to St James and founded in 1132. There are a number of events held at the Heritage Centre each year The Heritage Centre is inside a church which was saved from destruction by those with the insight to develop it as a local Heritage Centre. There are two large half-circle stained glass windows saved from the demolished Mausoleum to the Lord Nunburnholm Family. Disabled access. Children welcome. Smoking not allowed.",
