        "text": "Location: Highway 52, off Highway 8, just west of Rockton, Ontario\n\nSince its opening in 1964, the Westfield Heritage Centre has had a long and interesting past. The centre offers a view of what life in Ontario was like prior to Confederation. It is built on 340 hectares (840 acres) of land in the Rockton area, near the African Lion Safari, with a number of historical buildings designed to take visitors through a piece of Ontario's history.\n\nWestfield is the product of three Brantford teachers' desire to provide a hands-on educational experience from which their students would learn about pioneer life. Their idea was to preserve mid-19th century buildings and equip them with appropriate artifacts and tools, in order to make the experience of visiting the village as authentic as possible.\n\nComing to be known as the Westfield Pioneer Village Association, the historical group planned for the site to include a village church, school house, grist mill, covered bridge, general store, an inn, a printer's shop, a shoemaker's shop, a cabinet maker's shop, a drug store and a number of homes.\n\nIn 1961, the Association acquired 30 acres of land for the project. Shortly thereafter, the Toronto, Hamilton and Buffalo (TH&B) railway house at Jerseyville was moved to the village. A frame hotel from Middlesex County and a printing shop from Huron were also acquired for the site. Equipment for a general store was brought in from Elgin County, while hotel furnishings and early farm equipment Norfolk and apothecary equipment were brought in from from Oxford. An authentic 1500's-style press was placed in the print shop.\n\nThe village was unofficially opened to the public in June of 1963, and an official opening was held the following year, in June of 1964.\n\nAn ancient Indian church, which had been moved from the Six Nations Indian Reserve to Westfield was opened in 1965. It was built in 1814 at Stone Ridge (on the Six Nations Reservation), making it the oldest church in Ontario. When it was moved to the site, it was dedicated to all Christian faiths.\n\nBy 1967, the village founders began seeking Wentworth County Council support, even though the village was not experiencing any financial difficulty. The founders simply wanted county administration of the village and for the county to assume responsibility for its continued operation. They were also hoping that if the County were to take over the village, then it would not only find a place on the map, but would also be safe if current members of Westfield Pioneer Village Association lost interest or died.\n\nIn May of 1968, the Westfield Pioneer Village was purchased by the county for $32,700. It became an official county property on November 1,1968. At this time, plans were being made to further expand the village by acquiring at least eight more buildings.\n\nOne of the buildings that opened not long after the County's acquisition of the village was Dr. Beattie's Drug Store. Originally located in the small north-Burlington community of Kilbride in the late 1800s, it was moved to the village and re-opened on August 15th, 1971. It was fully-equipped with authentic mid-19th century items. In 1971 there was also the opening of the Apple Hill post office.\n\nUnfortunately, by this time the village was beginning to run into some financial difficulties. The centre was over budgeted and the county began to have doubts as to whether it should continue its involvement with the village. The City Council voted to place elected officials in control of the village. In 1972, ownership of Westfield Pioneer Village was transferred to the Hamilton-Wentworth region.\n\nThe village continued its expansion in 1975 by acquiring such buildings as a mud block house and spinning wheel shop which were built in 1837. In 1977, TH&B Engine 103 was moved to the village from Gage Park. Later, in 1981, a TH&B caboose dating back to World War I was also acquired.\n\nIn 1981, the region's Economic Development Committee recommended Council change the name of Westfield Pioneer Village to Wentworth Heritage Village because a major portion of the village's collection represented not the pioneer era of 1792 - 1812, but rather the period of 1814 to 1910. Most of the heritage that Westfield presented was related to the United Empire Loyalists and other early settlers, such as farmers and artisans. The name \"Pioneer Village\" was somewhat misleading, and it was hoped that by changing it, the village would be able to rid itself of a \"Walt Disney approach\" to its heritage.\n\nDespite its new name, the village's deficit continued to rise, and in 1983 discussions began about the possibility of the Hamilton Region Conservation Authority taking control of Westfield. By 1984, it was decided that the Wentworth Heritage Village was in serious need of approximately $1 million in repairs. If these repairs were not done, a great deal of the centre would be in ruin. Rumors circulated about funds being spent inappropriately. Records indicated that while the buildings were falling apart, a major portion of the money had been spent on acquiring new artifacts rather than on maintenance.\n\nOn September 3, 1984, Wentworth Heritage Village ceased operation. This shut-down took place 3 months before the planned closure for that season, with no guarantees of a re-opening in the following April.\n\nWith the centre still closed in 1985, discussions began on the possibility of re-locating the centre. The Christie Conservation area and Confederation Park were both considered viable alternatives. The idea was that a relocation to a better area might have attracted more visitors to the village. On May 12, 1986, the Regional Economic Development and Planning Committee recommended leaving the village in its current location and working instead on repairing the damage. Repair costs were estimated to be $1 million, whereas moving the entire site would have cost at least $1.7 million.\n\nFurther study was done on the repairs that the village would require. By February, 1987, it was estimated by the regional committee that $3 million of tax payer money would be required over the next five years to have the Wentworth Heritage Village suitable for re-opening. Later that year, the region decided to implement a plan which would call for the opening of the centre in 1990. The Regional Council approved spending $1.73 million over the next seven years to restore the heritage centre. Another $750,000 would be raised through donations and grants. It was calculated that $300, 000 would be required annually by the village to operate effectively and to cover the shortfall in revenues. Also, it was decided that the Wentworth Heritage Village's emphasis should be placed on education and wood-working.\n\nAlthough it seemed like a good idea at the time, the wood-working theme was eventually dropped in favour of yet another idea. This time, plans were being drawn up to have the heritage centre converted into a $10 million historical amusement park. By this time, the Hamilton Regional Conservation Authority had taken control of the village and it was up to them to figure out what should be done with it. Flamborough Mayor Jim Robb found it \"disgusting even to think about\" giving up on the village. By November of 1989, the amusement park idea was dropped, and discussions now focused on what reasonable action could be taken to save the Wentworth Heritage Village.\n\nRedevelopment of the site began in 1990, with a re-opening on November 30, 1990, occurring just in time for Christmas. The centre was now a \"special events theme centre,\" known as Westfield Heritage Centre, with its first theme being entitled Christmas in the Country. Redevelopment was scheduled to continue over the next five years, but at least the site was safe for the public to visit.\n\nBy 1991, episodes of the Canadian television miniseries \"Road to Avonlea\" were being filmed at Westfield Heritage Centre and the sets and props were put on display, attracting a great number of visitors. Actors from the series have occasionally hosted autograph sessions at the site, drawing a great number of fans eager to meet them.\n\nCivil war re-enactments are also played out at Westfield Heritage Centre. In fact, since the early 1990s, a different battle has been re-enacted each August. The re-enactors are people with a passion for accuracy and detail, learning how to march and carry their weapons with precision. The battles are fought before audiences who are later encouraged to speak with the actors to get a better understanding of what a civil war battle was really like. More than 50,000 Canadians fought in the civil war, and about 1,500 of these were Hamiltonians.\n\nThe Westfield Heritage Centre also holds a maple syrup program every spring, so visitors can explore the historic pioneer and modern maple syrup harvest.\n\nToday, Westfield is a living, breathing recreation of the past, with volunteers dressed in historically appropriate costumes working as their ancestors did in the past. The centre is divided into the following buildings:\n\nAlbrecht Siep Boot and Harness Shop\n\nAs long as horses were the source of power for wagons, buggies and ploughs, the leather worker's skill as a harness maker was essential to the community. This shop was a two-man enterprise. The master craftsman and his apprentice made all of the leather boots and harness from hides originating from the farms in the community. This shop dates back to 1859 and is from Waterloo County.\n\nBake Oven\n\nThis functional bake oven was used during the summer months when it was too hot to bake indoors. Bread could be baked on heated bricks, once the coals from the blazing fire were removed. Up to 25 loaves of bread could (and still can) be baked on this oven at one time.\n\nBamberger House\n\nBuilt c. 1806 by Samuel Bamberger, Bamberger House was moved from Hamilton's west-end in July 1993. It is Hamilton's oldest surviving building and is currently under restoration. When completed, the home will represent an 1850 upper-middle class homestead.\n\nBlacksmith Shop\n\nThis is a fully-equipped building typical of the blacksmith shops found throughout Ontario. The hand-cut pine rafters and oak studding remind visitors of the rugged simplicity of pioneer craftsmen. In addition to shoeing horses or oxen, the versatile blacksmith forged and repaired farm tools, wagon parts and many other necessities. This building dates back to 1853 and is from Wellington County.\n\nCabinetmaker's Shop\n\nThis building has been reconstructed from a cabinetmaker's shop in Burlington. It highlights the tools and techniques of the trade.\n\nCathcart School No. 24\n\nDating back to 1845 in Brant County, this school was donated by Mr. Alex Szombati, Sr., of the hamlet of Cathcart. This typical one-room schoolhouse served as a community school until 1865 when it became a residence.\n\nThe few textbooks were supplemented by the large charts and maps that can still be seen hanging on the wall. Slates were used for daily work, conserving pens, ink and paper for the final product that might be viewed by the inspector on his next visit. The children helped to maintain their school by keeping the stove burning, filling the water bucket, sweeping, as well as cleaning slates and brushes. The cane hanging behind the teachers desk reminds us of an earlier, harsher view of discipline.\n\nThe construction of this building is notable for the exceptional wide logs (the largest is 27 inches) that were positioned by man and animal power. Doors and windows were cut out after the logs were in place.\n\nD'Aubigny's Inn\n\nThis 1820 Brant County home was converted to an inn by William D'Aubigny in 1836-37. Many pioneer settlements grew up around a crossroads inn that also provided a village meeting place. The large, centrally located fireplace was typical of buildings of this period and the accommodations offered were very primitive. This inn once welcomed people at the outskirts of Brantford on the road to London.\n\nDrug Store\n\nThis building combines the examining room of Dr. Beattie and a drug store (or Apothecary), originally located in the village of Kilbride, in the Regional Municipality of Halton, in 1879. The many items on the shelves, which were gifts of the White Drug store in Aylmer, Hyde's Drugstore in Woodstock and Scott's Drugstore in Norwich, were used in the practice of medicine in the 1890s. These items include a saw, a capsule-making device, and a suppository-maker. The stained glass window, showing a mortar and pestle was made for the first drug store in St. George in Brant County.\n\nSince doctors were rare in the rural areas, farm families would have to be self-reliant in times of illness. Home remedies, many using native plants and learned from native peoples, were passed down from generation to generation. Medicinal herbs were also part of every home garden in urban areas.\n\nEdmundson House\n\nThis house is a gift of the City of Brantford, where it was built in 1827.\n\nEpiscopal Methodist Church\n\nThis church was built in 1854 by Charles Mount in Mountsberg and restored in 1970. A tower and spire were added as was the pulpit furniture which was used by a Methodist church in Elgin County. Until 1870, women were seated to the right and men on the left.\n\nGate House\n\nThis building serves as an administration office where admission can be paid and public washrooms are available.\n\nGeneral Store\n\nThe general store (c. 1848, Elgin County) was the center of the social and economic life of the village. Farmers came here to read the newspapers and catch up on the local gossip. The children enjoyed shopping errands since the general store was likely their only source of sweets, such as the rock candy which is still on sale at the store.\n\nGeorge Potts' Spinning Wheel Shop\n\nThis shop originally stood on the outskirts of the town of Simcoe. Dating back to 1886, this is where George Potts would manufacture Doolittle's spinning machines and is thought to be the only complete spinning wheel shop preserved in Ontario.\n\nGillen House\n\nThis elegant house (c. 1862) was home to four generations of the Gillen family at 100 Wellington Street, Brantford. Dubbed \"Old Hundred\" by the Gillen grandchildren, the house bears this name on the letter slot, and is a gift of the city of Brantford. The home was built by Robert Gillen, a magistrate, who died the very year it was completed. His widow and four daughters, the youngest of whom was only three, were its first occupants. Their love of culture and music is reflected in the furnishings throughout: in the front parlour, a Mason and Risch Victrola and a music box that operates on the organ principle using reeds and air; in the back parlour, a zither (an instrument similar to an autoharp), a Fischer square grand piano, and an Excelsior pump organ.\n\nInn Driveshed\n\nThe driveshed sheltered horses and carriages while its owners rested at the Inn.\n\nIronwood Tea House\n\nThe Ironwood Tea House is a nostalgic building and serves as Westfield's restaurant during special events and as a lunch facility during school programs. Food services are provided by the Friends of Westfield and features a delightful menu.\n\nLockhart Farmstead\n\nBuilding and maintaining a farmstead like this one, which typically has four buildings (house, smoke-house, outhouse and barn), took the labour of the entire family with little time for leisure. Many of the early settlers here, such as the Loyalists who were granted lands in British North America in return for their loyalty to the Crown during the American Revolution, had limited knowledge of farming and were even less prepared for clearing the wilderness. This building dates back to 1854 and was originally built in Oxford County.\n\nLog Church\n\nBelieved to be the oldest log church in Ontario, this building was erected in 1824 as a school but used as a church at Kanyengeh on the Six Nations Reserve until 1854. This is a reminder that the Mohawk came to this area as Christian Loyalist settlers, important British allies in North America.\n\nThe church was constructed of hand cut logs which was assembled without nails and chinked with oakum. The pews were handmade and seated about forty people. In 1962, the church was rededicated at Westfield in a service conducted in Mohawk and English.\n\nLog House\n\nA few different log houses exist at Westfield Heritage Centre, moved from various locations and representing different periods in history.\n\nMarr Shop\n\nCurrently under restoration, this small 1800's timber frame building was built in Ancaster.\n\nMcRobert Dry Goods Store\n\nOriginally from the village of Troy and dating back to 1850, this dry goods store has been furnished for the year 1899 with goods donated by individuals and stores in Wentworth County. The store took its name from storekeepers Brice McRoberts and his nephew Alexander McRoberts. The upstairs was originally used as a meeting place for community functions.\n\nMisener House\n\nThis building was occupied by Conrad Misener in 1832 and is an excellent example of a timber frame house in Upper Canada. It was built in the village of Troy and donated to Westfield by the Misener family.\n\nPotts Building\n\nA replica of the original mud block house of the Potts family from Simcoe, c. 1840, it features a display of Victorian \"heirlooms\", a small portion of the over 30,000 artifacts at Westfield..\n\nSawmill\n\nThis sawmill, built circa 1870, turned settlers' logs into lumber. This allowed a greater range of building types, and provided an important export item.\n\nSeth Fothergill's Print Shop\n\nA great step forward in the development of any district was the establishment of a print shop, such as this one constructed in Goderich. Here a village's weekly newspaper was printed along with handbills announcing sales, auctions, sporting events, political meetings and even funerals. The fine collection of wooden types in the cases at the back of the shop are still ready for use on the 1863 Washington flat bed press, the gift of the Hurley Printing Co. of Brantford. The Hoedrum type press, also dating from the 1860's, was operated by steam and required at least three men to operate it.\n\nTrading Post\n\nWentworth area trading posts have been located in what is now Crook's Hollow and at the site of Dundurn Castle in the 1700s. Trade with the native people remained an important part of Upper Canada's pioneer economy as late as the 1830's. Natives traded pelts, produce, basketware and leather beadwork for sugar, tobacco, gunpowder, blankets and other commodities. This c. 1830 two-storey building of tamarack logs from Leeds County, the former Dorman family residence and the gift of Mr. Hollis Dorman, shows many of the items stocked in a traditional trading post including traps, blankets, barrels, stoneware crocks and snow shoes."
