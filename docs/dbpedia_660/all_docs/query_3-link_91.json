        "text": "Yesterday, the bee keeper at Pickering Museum Village told us we had to visit the Bala Museum, so today we set off to check it out. What we found was not only a treasure trove of L.M. Montgomery information, but an amazing treasure in its proprietors as well.\n\nFirst, one needs a bit of background on why the Museum at Bala is significant. Montgomery and her husband used to vacation in PEI until the summer of 1922 when Ewan was in the middle of a lawsuit over a driving accident. Because of the legal hassles, they were discouraged from leaving the area. The situation was eventually resolved, but not before it was too late for a trip to PEI. So, the couple made the 80 kilometer trek from Leaskdale to Bala. They didn’t actually stay at the Bala Museum, then called Treelawn Lodge, but the Roselawn Lodge across the street. The Roselawn Lodge, however, didn’t serve meals, so they took their meals at Treelawn. It was actually the summer she spent at Bala which inspired Montgomery’s The Blue Castle, the only Montgomery novel set outside of PEI.\n\nThe way the Huttons got the house is nothing short of a miracle of Providential timing. They had just gotten married and decided to take a trip to PEI because of Linda’s love of Lucy Maud Montgomery. Jack, a writer himself, went along with the idea because of his love for Linda, but remarked that he had, at the time, never read Anne because it was considered “sissy” by young boys in school. When his new wife read it to him on their honeymoon, however, he was hooked. He then purchased The Alpine Path, a collection of Montgomery’s poetry and fell in love with her work.\n\nMeanwhile, Mary Rubio and Elizabeth Waterson, both Montgomery scholars, took a cruise on a steamboat in the area, trying to find the Island that is mentioned The Blue Castle. Mary and Elizabeth tried to find where Maud had stayed in Bala, and weren’t able to, so they left a note at the public library explaining she knew that Montgomery had stayed at Roselawn, but had mentioned in her journals taking her meals at a tourist home. “Does anyone know where that is?”\n\nWhen Jack and Linda returned, they were out taking a walk and saw the house for sale. They were fascinated by it, since it reminded them of the style they had seen in PEI. They toured it as a possible museum site, but dismissed it due to the long list of repairs needed. Then, the librarian showed them the letter from Mary Rubio. From a phone call to the owner of Roselawn, they were able to discover that Montgomery had stayed at Roselawn, but taken her meals at the very house they had toured. It had been owned by “Crazy Fanny,” who was described by Montgomery as “a lady cumbered by much serving.” When Linda discovered that the house where Montgomery had taken her meals was still around, and that, with the loss of the original lodge at Roselawn in the 1940’s, this would be the last tie to The Blue Castle and Montgomery’s experience in this area, she was appalled, especially when she learned there were plans to tear the house down due to its poor condition. She pleaded with Jack to buy the house, and he relented when he saw how important the project was to his new wife. The Huttons purchased the home, and Linda began a year of renovating the home. In addition to a stove they found in the shed from the 1920’s when Montgomery was staying there, the Hutton’s were able to find a number of antiques from the time period in order to decorate. David Montgomery, L.M. Montgomery’s grandson, first loaned several artifacts to the museum, then eventually decided they belonged with the house. The Huttons also have acquired one of the most complete sets of Montgomery’s books, including many first editions. They also have quite a bit of early Anne memorabilia, including the story of and actual first translation of the book into Japanese, translations into a number of languages, the only complete set of Green Gables imprinted dishes, the silver tea service given to Montgomery as a wedding present, and many Anne dolls and movies. Additionally, for the Anne of Green Gables fans, the Museum contains many items from both the Anne movies and The Road to Avonlea series, including costumes and even the Lily Maid boat in which Megan Follows, (who incidentally spent a summer with her family at Bala), played the Lady of Shalott.\n\nBut, in addition to the incredible collection of Anne items, we were entranced by the knowledge and stories of Jack Hutton, who shared so much of Maud’s life, even quoting extensively from her journals and works. As an added bonus, Jack is an incredible pianist, who performs on many of the steamboats nearby. He consented to play for us before we left. Jack and Linda co-authored a book entitled Lucy Maud Montgomery and Bala which shares, not only their story, but additional little known information about Montgomery. They have also recreated the Anne of Green Gables 1919 silent movie. This Museum is truly a jewel to visit.\n\nAfter attending Catch the Fire Toronto (formerly the Toronto Airport Christian Fellowship of revival fame), we set off for Pickering Museum Village. The village had come up on our search for Anne sites, and we were excited to see what we could find. It was a tad difficult to find, since we didn’t have an address, so for anyone else trying to find it, the address is: 2365 6th Concession Road in Greenwood, Ontario, Canada.\n\nBeing a Civil War reenactor myself, I am quite at home in living history and love history done well. Pickering Village, from beginning to end, was just such a place. We had lucked out on the day to come to Pickering Village, since it was also The Duffins Creek Spring Fair. So in addition to the normal fun of the village, there were a number of activities and food to enhance the day. We were able to see metal rims fitted to a wheel; sample beans, bread, and rhubarb cake; and learn about local beekeeping and honey. Additionally, each reenactor was extremely knowledgeable.\n\nWhen we first walked in and explained that we were from the states and interested in the Anne sites, we were directed to Mandy Smiles, who seems to wear a variety of hats\n\nin addition to her role as event programmer. Mandy had just finished judging the Beard and Moustache Competition, and, being an Anne fan herself, was quite willing to take us to all the filming locations around the Village.\n\nFirst, we went to The Cole House, which served as Moody Spurgeon’s House in Anne of Green Gables, Angus McCorkadale’s house in Road to Avonlea and farmhouse in An Avonlea Christmas. It is the notorious spot where Anne both walked and fell off the ridge pole. It also sports the fence Josie Pye walked before jumping into Gilbert’s arms.\n\nAfter that, we headed to the Oddfellows Hall, which today hosted the Quilt show, but was previously used as the site of Anne’s Christmas ball (Carmody Town Hall) and the staircase she and Diana walked down before the big dance. It was also used as the Avonlea Town Hall in a number of episodes of Road to Avonlea (My favorite being “The Materializing of Duncan McTavish.”) The Bible Christian Church was also used as the town hall in a number of episodes.\n\nAdditionally, we saw the Collin’s House, the Log House, and the Blacksmith’s Shop, all of which were used as various farmhouses in different Avonlea episodes. The General Store was also used in An Avonlea Christmas and as the Police Station in “Aunt Janet Rebels.”\n\nMandy told us that Pickering Museum Village will be hosting its own Anne of Green Gables Day, to celebrate their part in the Avonlea Series. The Anne of Green Gables Day will be held June 30, 2012, so anyone in the Toronto Area (or loyal fans from abroad), be sure to check it out.\n\nMandy also shared with us some of the other local sites, including The Parkwood Estate (270 Simcoe Street North in Oshawa), which was used in Anne the Continuing story, as Jack’s mother’s house and garden where they have tea at the end of the movie. (When we left, we were able to stop by there, though we didn’t get to tour the house, since we arrived about the time the gates were closed.) She also directed us to Katrina, who was able to help us find Lucy Maud Montgomery’s Toronto house, which we will visit another day.\n\nAll in all, our trip to Pickering Museum Village was an amazing time, and I was incredibly impressed with how helpful each staff member was, how knowledgeable and friendly each reenactor was, and in short, what a well run historical site this is!\n\nToday (8/2/11), was supposed to be a rainy day, but it was clear when we woke up, so we decided to risk going to Victoria. Victoria doesn’t have anything to do with Lucy Maud Montgomery (Though the Victoria Women’s Institute managed to secure a grant by convincing the committee that it did because Anne and Gilbert: The Musical debuted there.), but it was on the way to “Gus’s Lighthouse” from the Road to Avonlea series, so we decided to stop in.\n\nVictoria has the major attraction of a program called “Follow the Fiddler.” This is an incredibly imaginative way of telling the history of Victoria through a walking tour complete with fiddling, story telling, puppets, and an amazing finale with singing and dancing. It was definitely worth the price of admission ($18 for adults, kids 14 & under a free.) It actually ended up a connection to Montgomery after all, though. The finale featured the PEI anthem, written by Lucy Maud Montgomery herself (Unfortunately, I realized that too late to record it…).\n\nAfter that we headed to Seacow Head where “Gus’s Lighthouse” from the Road to Avonlea series is located (As well as some of the intro shots in Anne of Green Gables. It was amazing to see, though a storm was coming in, so it wasn’t as nice as it otherwise would have been. It’s been cool to rewatch the episodes and identify places we’ve been (Jasper’s barns and the lighthouse were featured on today’s episonde.)\n\nLeaving there, we were planning on just heading to Summerside where we would catch Anne and Gilbert: The Musical, but as we were driving through Bedeque, I remembered that Lower Bedeque was the location of one of the schools L.M. Montgomery taught at during her three years of teaching. We located the building–the museum was closed–and were able to take a few pictures, a difficult task while trying to swat mosquitoes with the hand NOT holding the camera. I may revisit there again to see what all is inside the school house.\n\nFinally, we went to Anne and Gilbert: The Musical. We were super early, so I got to take a few evening pictures around Summerside. Then, it was time to start. The musical was very fun! I think we all enjoyed it better than Anne of Green Gables because we were so familiar with that story, while this one was an entirely unique story using the same characters. The kids loved it and were even singing songs from the production on the way home. Very well done indeed. Tomorrow, it’s another rainy day, so back to Charlottetown to research and then to Bideford for Wednesday Evenings with L.M. Montgomery."
