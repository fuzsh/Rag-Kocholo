        "text": "Westfield Parramatta, September 2017. Image: Anna Namuren, Parramatta Heritage Centre\n\nThe Westfield retail centre was launched in Parramatta in 1975 [1] in the same year that consumers were introduced to Bankcard, Australia’s first credit card. [2]\n\nWestfield Shoppingtown Parramatta, as it was then known, was the largest shopping centre in Australia for many years. [3]\n\nWestfield Parramatta currently occupies five levels of retail stores, spanning five blocks which are bordered by Church, Argyle, Marsden and Campbell Streets.\n\nThe global company started as a retailing partnership in 1956, between John Saunders and Frank Lowy, who arrived in Australia in their twenties. [4] After opening the first Westfield in Blacktown in July 1959, the partners were soon influenced by the concept of the ‘one-stop-shopping’ model of retailing from the United States, which came to characterise future Westfield developments. [5]\n\nWestfield development awning, Sydney c. 1960s. Image: Westfield History\n\nPlanning for the Parramatta retail complex commenced in 1971, with the aim of incorporating the existing Grace Bros store which had been established on the corner of Church Street and Argyle Street since 1933. [6]\n\nIn May 1974 development was approved by Parramatta City Council, with further consent for an expanded retail floor area and a tavern. [7] In the same year, the redeveloped Grace Bros included a food hall and supermarket, with specialty butcher’s shop, delicatessen, bakery and take-away food. There was a hardware and ‘handyman’ section on the ground floor. Over 2000 cars per day could be accommodated in the multi-level carpark. [8]\n\nWestfield Shoppingtown advertising banner, c. 1980s. Image: Parramatta Heritage Centre, ACC/002/077/002\n\nThe completed Westfield shopping centre opened in September 1975 and did not undergo any major alterations until 1986 when approval was granted to expand to over 300 specialty shops and a four-theatre cinema complex. [9]\n\nIn 1989 a proposal to build an underground pedestrian underpass to link the shopping centre with the railway station precinct to ease the passage of commuters to the stores was submitted and subsequently approved. [10]\n\nWestfield Parramatta expanded its retail footprint further in 1992, to encompass properties on the north side of Aird Street between O’Connell and Marsden Streets, and the eastern half of the block bounded by Aird, Marsden, Campbell and O’Connell Streets. This included redevelopment of part of the original Westfield Shoppingtown on the corner of Argyle and Marsden Streets, and the northern side of Campbell Street. [11]\n\nThe excavation area measured 3,240 square metres out of a total of more than 17,500 square metres, and was one of the largest archaeological excavation sites in Parramatta. The site revealed the foundations of buildings on what would have been the fringes of Parramatta town in the 19th century. [12]\n\nPlan of a two-roomed cottage built prior to 1823 on Allotment 16, Aird Street. Image: Edward Higginbotham & Associates Pty Ltd\n\nIn 1996 the David Jones department store relocated to Westfield Parramatta from its former site on Church Street beside Parramatta River, [13] joining Grace Bros, which became known as ‘Myer’, in the expanded centre.\n\nWestfield was a major sponsor of the Sydney 2000 Olympic Games [14] and in the same year Westfield Parramatta celebrated its 25th Anniversary with a visit by fashion models Jerry Hall and Claudia Schiffer. [15]\n\nThe decade which followed was characterised by the construction of a skybridge across Church Street linking the cinemas with the shopping centre [16] and the introduction of a site-wide Smoke-free zone which included shops and the carpark. [17]\n\nIn recent years, the Westfield Corporation adopted strategies in line with technological and social changes, which have seen traditional retail stores compete to remain operational with the consumer shift to online shopping. In 2016 Westfield Labs was established in San Francisco to help prototype innovative, new ways to engage shoppers globally online. [18]\n\nOn December 12, 2017, the Westfield Corporation was sold to the European company Unibail-Rodamco for $32 billion. The Lowy family retained a small stake in Scentre Group, a separate company, which operates the Westfield shopping centres in Australia and New Zealand. [50]\n\nWestfield timeline\n\nEarly 1800s: In Parramatta many retailers sell a great variety of goods.
