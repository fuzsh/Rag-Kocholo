        "text": "Westfield Heritage Village hosts its annual Star Party on Friday, May 13th from 7 to 10pm and invites you to experience the wonders of the night sky through the eyes of trained astronomers. Presented in partnership with the Royal Astronomical Society and McMaster University, this dazzling event will provide an opportunity to learn about the night sky through a fun and interactive evening of exploration and discovery.\n\nYou will be able to meet experts from McMaster University’s Let’s Talk Science and Sidewalk Astronomy groups and well as the Royal Astronomical Society of Canada Hamilton Centre.\n\nOnce the sun sets, stargazing will be a highlight of this evening, and visitors will have opportunities to peer through both antique and modern telescopes. Under the guidance of a member of the Royal Astronomical society, you will be able to look deep into the sky through the rare 1884 Bell refracting telescope. Astronomers using modern telescopes will also be stationed in the Village Green, where they will introduce visitors to modern-day astronomy techniques. Old or new, the view through these telescopes is sure to take your breath away.\n\nIn addition to stargazing, there will be lots of other activities happening during the evening. You can watch A Trip to the Moon, a unique 1902 film by French filmmaker Georges Méliès, make a charming take-home craft in the one room schoolhouse, buy sweet treats, including star cookies, at the General Store, and watch a magical traditional shadow play that tells the stories of popular constellations. You can even take your picture on a Paper Moon!\n\nOutdoor activities and star viewing will be weather permitting. Only select historical buildings will be open for this program. Historic buildings will close at 9:00pm and stargazing will continue until 10:00pm.\n\nWho can attend: Everyone\n\nFee: Adults $8.50, Seniors $7.50, Children $5.50. Five and under are free.
