        "text": "A popular NHS blood donation centre in Westfield Stratford City has extended its presence at the shopping centre and moved to a new floor, after becoming one of the most successful blood donor centres in England for the number of blood donations made.\n\nThe NHS Blood Donor centre in Westfield Stratford City has facilitated over 50,000 blood donations since opening in 2020 – over 14,000 of which were new donors. First set up temporarily during the pandemic to collect convalescent plasma, the original Westfield Stratford City donor centre became very popular with donors and remained open to collect whole blood.\n\nThe new Stratford blood donor centre is located on the First Floor (next to Clarks and opposite John Lewis and Costa Coffee) at Westfield Stratford City, London, E20 1EJ, shown on this map.\n\nCaroline Eaton-Howell, Area Manager for London donor centres at NHS Blood and Transplant said:\n\n\"The success of blood donation in Stratford – particularly with new donors and donors of Black heritage – since we first made our presence known in 2020 has showed there is huge demand for blood donation opportunities to continue in the area.\"\n\n\"We are delighted to keep collecting blood in Westfield Stratford City and would encourage anyone considering becoming a donor, or if you’ve not donated in a while, to come along to the new centre and help the NHS save even more lives.\"\n\n\"Last week, the first full week since moving floors, we collected a record 784 blood donations since opening back in 2020 which is fantastic to see.\"\n\nOver 1,800 people of Black heritage give blood in Stratford. This is the largest number of active Black heritage donors in one venue in England.\n\nMore than 800 new Black heritage donors signed up and gave blood for the first time in Stratford last year, the largest number in the country.\n\nThere is an urgent need for more donors of Black heritage as they are more likely to have the blood type needed to treat sickle cell patients – the fastest growing genetic blood disorder in the UK and which mostly affects people of Black heritage.\n\nThe demand for ethnically matched blood for these patients is on the rise and has already doubled in recent years.\n\nOnly a short walk from its previous location within Westfield Stratford City, the new Stratford blood donor centre is a comfortable modern environment with a caring team to welcome all donors into the new site.\n\nAlyson Hodkinson, General Manager at Westfield Stratford City commented:\n\n\"We are proud to be continuing our support of the NHS blood donor centre as it relocates within Westfield Stratford City. By providing an even more convenient and accessible location for blood donation, our centre continues to serve a vital role in supporting the local community and helping the NHS to save lives.”\n\nInformation for visiting the centre\n\nThe new opening hours are:\n\nMonday, Wednesday, Friday, Saturday, Sunday: 08:30 – 12:05 & 13:40 – 16:55.\n\nTuesday, Thursday: 10:30 – 14:05 & 15:40 – 18:55\n\nCar parking is available in the Westfield Stratford City car-park. Only a few minutes’ walk away, Stratford station provides easy access to the centre via Central, Elizabeth, Jubilee, Overground, and DLR lines.\n\nPermanent donor centres in towns and cities generally have greater availability and longer opening hours than mobile sessions that are held in community venues such as church halls.\n\nBlood is needed to help the NHS treat patients with cancer, blood disorders and those suffering medical trauma or undergoing surgery, and O negative blood is mostly used for emergency care.\n\nEach donation can save or improve up to three lives."
