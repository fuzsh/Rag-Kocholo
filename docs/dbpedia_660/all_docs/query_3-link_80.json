        "text": "The museum will be open free of charge on Saturday, March 9, and Sunday, March 10, 2024.\n\nWHEATON, Md. – Montgomery Parks, and Westfield Montgomery Mall are partnering to honor Black History Month by offering free entry to the Josiah Henson Museum and Park, which is located on the former plantation of Isaac Riley where Reverend Josiah Henson was enslaved. The museum and park will be open free of charge on Saturday, March 9, between 10 a.m. and 4 p.m., and on Sunday, March 10, from 12 to 4 p.m. Reservations are not required.\n\nThe museum is a historic resource of local, state, national, and international significance because of its association with Reverend Henson, whose 1849 autobiography, The Life of Josiah Henson, Formerly a Slave, Now an Inhabitant of Canada, inspired Harriet Beecher Stowe’s landmark novel, Uncle Tom’s Cabin.\n\n“We appreciate the partnership with Westfield Montgomery Mall and encourage people to come out and visit the museum and learn about the incredible life and story of Reverend Josiah Henson,” said Mark Thorne, Historic Site Manager at Josiah Henson Museum and Park.\n\n“Westfield Montgomery is proud to partner with Montgomery Parks and the Josiah Henson Museum and Park to use our platform to help share the inspiring story of Reverend Henson with our community,” said Stuart Amos, senior general manager of Westfield Montgomery.\n\nAbout Josiah Henson Museum & Park\n\nThe Josiah Henson Museum & Park, located at 11410 Old Georgetown Road in North Bethesda, is the first museum in the United States dedicated to Reverend Josiah Henson. Situated on the grounds of the former plantation where Henson was enslaved prior to self-emancipating to Canada, the site includes a Visitor Center, a historic house with an attached log kitchen dating to 1850, and a 4-acre landscaped park with accessible walking paths. Indoor and outdoor interpretive exhibits throughout the property detail Henson’s inspirational life story, enslavement in Maryland, and the ongoing struggles for racial equality and justice. The Josiah Henson Museum & Park is part of the National Park Service National Underground Railroad Network to Freedom program.\n\nBorn into slavery, Henson defied the odds to become an influential author, Methodist minister, abolitionist, public speaker, and world-renowned figure. Among Henson’s many accomplishments was his 1849 autobiography, The Life of Josiah Henson, Formerly a Slave, Now an Inhabitant of Canada, which inspired Harriet Beecher Stowe’s landmark anti-slavery novel, Uncle Tom’s Cabin.\n\nAbout Montgomery Parks\n\nMontgomery Parks manages more than 37,000 acres of parkland, consisting of 419 parks. Montgomery Parks is focused on promoting physical activity, social connectivity, and environmental stewardship, especially in diverse and urbanizing areas, with an emphasis on teens, working-age adults, and seniors.
