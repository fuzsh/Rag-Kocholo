        "text": "Interested in a little summer time travel? Westfield Heritage Village is a stunning collection of over 30 historical buildings, making it one of the most interesting historical destinations in Ontario. Carefully restored and staffed with costumed interpreters, the buildings capture the true charm and spirit of early Canadian culture.\n\nWestfield Heritage Village provides educational, all-ages fun, as Frugal Mom Eh! Blogger, Elizabeth recently found out, “Westfield Heritage Village is a true treasure and so interesting and fun for all ages, and I am thrilled that we discovered it!”\n\nRead all about Elizabeth’s trip to Westfield Heritage Village with her young daughter below.\n\nEXPLORE EARLY CANADIAN CULTURE AT WESTFIELD HERITAGE VILLAGE #HAMILTONHALTONBRANT\n\nELIZABETH – I spent the afternoon with my Sister, Keira and Ava walking through Westfield Heritage Village, located in Rockton (Hamilton), Ontario.\n\nWestfield Heritage Village is a collection of over 40 historical buildings sourced from the surrounding area and restored as accurately as possible in order to recreate a village typical of the late 19th century.\n\nThe village is staffed with costumed historical interpreters and offers many demonstrations of how things were done at the time.\n\nNote that the village is mostly in the middle of a woodlot so be sure to bring not only sunscreen but insect repellent as well. It is also partially wheelchair accessible which also means only partially stroller accessible. I would recommend using a baby carrier if possible as getting baby in and out of the stroller to look through buildings with second floors or steps gets a bit silly.\n\nMost of the village is walk-able via dirt path and it is fairly large. I think we got to maybe 1/2 of the buildings, so we will definitely be heading back later in the summer to take in the rest, perhaps during the Ice Cream Carnival in August.\n\nOur first stop was the Blacksmith’s House which was built before 1828 in Beverly Township. It apparently housed a family of 10 with one large main room, a parlour, a pantry and an upstairs loft for sleeping quarters.\n\nRight across from the Blacksmith’s house is the Blacksmith Shop which was one of the very first buildings moved to Westfield. The Blacksmith was happy to demonstrate use of the billows as well as to share with us many fascinating details of his trade.\n\nWe loved walking through the covered bridge which is a reproduction of the style of bridge you would find in the Victorian Era. The details, right down to the lantern holders are really special. It reminded me of the covered bridge in Road to Avonlea.\n\nI have to say that all the interpreters we came across were quite excellent. All were very knowledgeable and obviously interested in the history of the building they were interpreting.\n\nThe newest addition to Westfield is the Westbrook House, which apparently just opened in May for viewing. The building was brought over from Brant County and was build by the family of Haggai Westbrook around 1810. The Westbrook House is in striking contrast to the Blacksmith’s House which was more the type you would find in Upper Canada at the time. The Westbrooks were obviously wealthy and the house is what would have been considered large at the time.\n\nMountsberg Church was built in 1854 by Charles Mount in Mountsberg. According to the guide, until 1870 women were seated to the right and men on the left. Our interpreter had a wealth of information to share with us about the building – it’s history and its restoration. The Church is also available for contemporary weddings which would be pretty amazing between the use of the Church, the beautiful grounds themselves and the Hall also available for events.\n\nMy sister was particularly interested in visiting the Drug Store which combines the examining room of Dr. Beattie with an apothecary. The stained glass window, showing a mortar and pestle, was made for the first drug store in St. George. The interpreter playing Dr. Beattie demonstrated how a tooth would have been pulled at the time as well as how medicines and pills would have been made at the time.\n\nLocated right behind the Drug Store is the The TH&B station, originally located in the village of Jerseyville, was built in 1896 and operated between Hamilton and Brantford. It was also featured in the movie Anne of Green Gables and the television series Road to Avonlea. Keira got a train ticket which she faithfully held on to the rest of our day.\n\nVisitors are able to even venture inside one of the cars of the train which seemed to particularly fascinate Keira. It was actually really interesting to see inside, I was surprised by all that I found in there, I wouldn’t have expected some of the facilities we found inside.\n\nTH&B Locomotive 103, this Class “G” Consolidated type steam locomotive was built in Montreal in 1910 for the Toronto, Hamilton and Buffalo Railway as No. 52, but its number was changed twice, finally to 103. After many years of service, this mighty locomotive, one of two of its type to be preserved, was placed in Hamilton’s Gage Park before being moved to Westfield in the early 1970’s.\n\nMcRoberts Dry Goods Store was originally located in the town of Troy, the second floor depicts the working and living area of a seamstress. The main floor features ready-made clothing, materials, and trimmings for making your own. It features a rather large and impressive collection of clothing from the time period, including a section of baby and childrens clothing.\n\nStopping in at the General Store is a must. The building is from the village of Springfield in Elgin County, circa 1848. The storekeeper also served as a banker, extending or denying credit to his customers. Eddie D. Cat Confectionery features old-fashioned candies and other treats.\n\nIt was hot so this was the perfect time to buy some ice cold soda from the General store and enjoy it out on the boardwalk. I definitely recommend the Black Cherry. Yum!\n\nAnother of our favourite stops was the Cathcart School. Built in 1845, from Brant County. The schoolhouse was particularly interesting to us as our dad actually attended a one-room schoolhouse before it burnt down in 1957, the very same one my grandmother attended in the 1920s.\n\nKeira loved practising her letters on the slate boards with real slate pencils. The school also features a bell the teacher may let you ring if you’ve been well behaved and remember to clean your slate.\n\nOperated by Hamilton Conservation Authority, Westfield Heritage Village is open Sundays and Holidays from 12:30 p.m. until 4:00 p.m. from March through October.\n\nNext time we will show up at opening and planned to stay for the day, and we will definitely be returning to see the rest and to experience the village during different seasons. Westfield Heritage Village is a true treasure and so interesting and fun for all ages, and I am thrilled that we discovered it!\n\nWestfield Heritage Village is open for Canada Day, and I can’t think of a better way to celebrate than by exploring life at the very beginning of our wonderful Country."
