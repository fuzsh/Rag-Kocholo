Home to beautifully preserved historic buildings and reminiscent of times bygone, the Westfield Heritage Village is a magnificently restored heritage center. The motive of the village is to educate the public about early Canadian culture. Visitors can experience live history demonstrations and take part in guided tours of the 130-hectare site which is bordered by beautiful woodlands, meadows and trails. The volunteers and staff are dressed in period costume and were very knowledgeable about the property and its heritage. A number of special events take place here on a regular basis.
