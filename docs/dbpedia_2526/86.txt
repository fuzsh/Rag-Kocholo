PSALM 125

In convertendo Dominus captivitatem Sion, facti sumus sicut consolati.

Tunc repletum est gaudio os nostrum, et lingua nostra exsultatione. Tunc dicent inter gentes: Magnificavit Dominus facere cum eis.

Magnificavit Dominus facere nobiscum; facti sumus laetantes.

Converte, Domine, captivitatem nostram, sicut torrens in austro.

Qui seminant in lacrimis, in exsultatione metent.

Euntes ibant et flebant, mittentes semina sua. Venientes autem venient cum exsultatione, portantes manipulos suos.

When the Lord brought back the captivity of Sion, we became like men comforted.

Then was our mouth filled with gladness; and our tongue with joy. Then shall they say among the Gentiles: The Lord hath done great things for them.

The Lord hath done great things for us: we are become joyful.

Turn again our captivity, O Lord, as a stream in the south.

They that sow in tears shall reap in joy.

Going they went and wept, casting their seeds.

But coming they shall come with joyfulness, carrying their sheaves.
