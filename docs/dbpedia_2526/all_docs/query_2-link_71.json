        "text": "This article is about Psalm 126 in Hebrew (Masoretic) numbering. For Psalm 126 in Greek Septuagint or Latin Vulgate numbering, see Psalm 127.\n\nPsalm 126 is the 126th psalm of the Book of Psalms, beginning in English in the King James Version: \"When the Lord turned again the captivity of Zion, we were like them that dream\". In Latin, it is known as In convertendo Dominus.[1] It is one of the fifteen Songs of Ascent in the Book of Psalms whose opening words in Hebrew are \"Shir HaMaalot\" (שיר המעלות בשוב ה’, a Song of Ascents). In the slightly different numbering system used in the Greek Septuagint version of the Bible and in the Latin Vulgate, this psalm is Psalm 125.\n\nThis six-verse psalm forms a regular part of Jewish, Catholic, Lutheran, Anglican and other Protestant liturgies. It is well known in Judaism as the preliminary psalm recited before the Birkat Hamazon (Grace After Meals) on Shabbat and Jewish holidays, and as such is sung to a wide variety of melodies. It has also inspired hymns based on it, and has often been set to music, such as Jean-Philippe Rameau and Jules Van Nuffel who set the psalm in Latin."
