        "text": "ARTICLE II\n\nSecondly, we ask:\n\nIs there memory in the mind?\n\n[ARTICLE De ver., 19, 1; I Sent., 3, 4, 1; III Sent., 26, 1, 5, ad 4; IV Sent., 44, 3, 3, sol. 2, ad 4; 50, 1, 2; Quodl., III, 9, 21; XII, 9, 12; C.G., II, 74; 1 Cor., c. 13, lect. 3; S.T., I, 79,6; 1-11, 67, 2; De memor. et remin., 2 . ]\n\nSecundo quaeritur utrum in mente sit memoria Difficulties Et videtur quod non. It seems that there is not, for Quia secundum Augustinum, XII de Trinitate, illud quod est commune nobis et brutis non pertinet ad mentem. Memoria autem nobis et brutis communis est, ut patet per Augustinum, Lib. X Confess. Ergo memoria non est in mente. 1. According to. Augustine, that which we share with brute animals does not belong to the mind. But memory is common to us and to brute animals, as is also clear from Augustine. Therefore, memory is not in the mind. Praeterea, philosophus in cap. de memoria et reminiscentia dicit, quod memoria non est intellectivi, sed primi sensitivi. Cum ergo mens sit idem quod intellectus, ut ex dictis patet, videtur quod memoria non sit in mente. 2. The Philosopher says that memory does not belong to the intellective but to the primary sensitive faculty. Therefore, since mind is the same as understanding, as is clear from what has been said above, memory does not seem to be part of the mind. Praeterea, intellectus, et omnia quae ad intellectum pertinent, abstrahunt ab hic et nunc; memoria vero non abstrahit; concernit namque determinatum tempus, scilicet praeteritum; memoria namque praeteritorum est, ut dicit Tullius. Ergo memoria non pertinet ad mentem vel intellectum. 3. Understanding and all that belong to understanding abstract from space and time. Memory, however, does not so abstract, for it deals with a definite time, the past. For memory concerns things past, as Cicero says. Therefore, memory does not pertain to mind or understanding. Praeterea, cum in memoria conserventur aliqua quae non actu apprehenduntur, ubicumque ponitur memoria, oportet quod ibi differat apprehendere et retinere. In intellectu autem non differunt, sed solum in sensu. Propter hoc enim in sensu differre possunt, quia sensus organo corporali utitur; non autem omne quod tenetur in corpore, apprehenditur. Intellectus autem non utitur organo corporali; unde nihil in eo retinetur nisi intelligibiliter; et sic oportet quod actu intelligatur. Ergo memoria non est in intellectu sive in mente. 4. Since in memory we retain things that are not being actually apprehended, it follows that, wherever there is memory, there must be a difference between apprehension and retention. But it is in sense only, and not in understanding, that we find this difference. The two can differ in sense because sense makes use of a bodily organ. But not everything that is retained in the body is apprehended. But understanding does not make use of a bodily organ, and so retains things only according to the mode of understanding. So, these things have to be actually understood. Therefore, memory is not part of understanding or mind. Praeterea, anima non memoratur antequam aliquid apud se retineat. Sed antequam aliquas species recipiat a sensibus, a quibus omnis cognitio nostra oritur, quas retinere possit, est ad imaginem. Cum ergo memoria sit pars imaginis, non videtur quod memoria possit esse in mente. 5. The soul does not remember until it has retained something. But before it receives from the senses, which are the source of all our know ledge, any species which it can retain, it already has the character of image [of the Trinity]. Since memory is part of that image, it does not seem possible for memory to be in the mind. Praeterea, mens, secundum quod est ad imaginem Dei, fertur in Deum. Sed memoria non fertur in Deum; est enim memoria eorum quae cadunt sub tempore; Deus autem est omnino supra tempus. Ergo memoria non est in mente. 6. In so far as mind has the character of image of God, it is directed toward God. But memory is not directed toward God, since it deals with things that belong to time. But God is entirely beyond time. Therefore, memory is not in the mind. Praeterea, si memoria esset pars mentis, species intelligibiles in ipsa mente reservarentur sicut conservantur in mente Angeli. Sed Angelus convertendo se ad species quas penes se habet, potest intelligere. Ergo et mens convertendo se ad species retentas; et ita posset intelligere sine hoc quod ad phantasmata converteretur; quod manifeste apparet esse falsum. Quantumcumque enim aliquis scientiam in habitu habeat, laeso tamen organo imaginativae virtutis vel memorativae, in actum exire non potest; quod non esset, si mens in actu intelligere posset non convertendo se ad potentias quae organis utuntur. Unde memoria non est in mente. 7. If memory were part of the mind, the intelligible species would be maintained in the mind as they are in the angelic mind. But the angels can understand by turning their attention to the species which they have within them. Therefore, the human mind should be able to understand by turning its attention to the species it retains, without referring to phantasms. But this is obviously false. For, no matter to what degree one has scientific knowledge as a habit, if the organ of the power of imagination or memory is injured, this knowledge cannot be made actual. This would not result if the mind could actually understand without referring to powers which use organs. So, memory is not part of the mind. Sed contra. To the Contrary Philosophus dicit in III de anima, quod anima est locus specierum, praeter quod non tota, sed intellectiva. Loci autem est conservare contenta in eo. Cum igitur conservare species ad memoriam pertineat, videtur quod in intellectu sit memoria. 1. The Philosopher says that the intellective soul, not the whole soul, is the place of the species. But it belongs to place to preserve what is kept in it. Therefore, since the preservation of the species belongs to memory, memory seems to be part of understanding. Praeterea, illud quod se habet aequaliter ad omne tempus, non concernit aliquod tempus particulare. Sed memoria, etiam proprie accepta, se habet aequaliter ad omne tempus, ut dicit Augustinus, XIV de Trinitate, et probat per dicta Virgilii, qui proprie nomine memoriae et oblivionis usus est. Ergo memoria non concernit aliquod tempus particulare, sed omne. Ergo ad intellectum pertinet. 2. That which has a uniform relation to all time is not concerned with any particular time. But memory, even in its proper acceptation, has a uniform relation to all time, as Augustine says and proves with the words of Virgil, who used the names memory and forgetfulness in their proper sense. Therefore, memory is not concerned with any particular time, but with all time. So it belongs to understanding. Praeterea, memoria, proprie accipiendo, est praeteritorum. Sed intellectus non solum est praesentium sed etiam praeteritorum. Intellectus enim compositionem format, secundum quodlibet tempus intelligens hominem fuisse, futurum esse, et esse, ut patet III de anima. Ergo memoria, proprie loquendo, ad intellectum potest pertinere. 3. Strictly speaking, memory refers to things past. But understanding deals not only with what is present, but also with what is past. For the understanding judges about any time, understanding man to have existed, to exist in the future, and to exist now, as is clear from The Soul. Therefore, memory, properly speaking, can belong to understanding. Praeterea, sicut memoria est praeteritorum, ita providentia est futurorum, secundum Tullium. Sed providentia est in parte intellectiva, proprie accipiendo. Ergo eadem ratione et memoria. 4. As memory concerns what is past, so foresight concerns what is in the future, according to Cicero. But foresight, properly speaking, belongs to the intellectual part. For the same reason memory does, too. Responsio. REPLY Dicendum, quod memoria secundum communem usum loquentium pro notitia praeteritorum accipitur. Cognoscere autem praeteritum ut est praeteritum, est illius cuius est cognoscere nunc ut nunc: hoc autem est sensus. Sicut enim intellectus non cognoscit singulare ut est hoc, sed secundum aliquam communem rationem, ut inquantum est homo vel albus vel etiam particularis, non autem inquantum est hic homo, vel particulare hoc: ita etiam intellectus cognoscit praesens et praeteritum non inquantum est hoc nunc et hoc praeteritum. According to the common usage, memory means a knowledge of things past. But to know the past as past belongs to that which has the power of knowing the now as now. Sense is this power. For understanding does not know the singular as singular, but according to some common character, as it is man or white or even particular, but not in so far as it is this man or this particular thing. In a similar way, understanding does not know a present and a past thing as this present and this past thing. Unde, cum memoria secundum propriam sui acceptionem respiciat ad id quod est praeteritum respectu huius nunc: constat quod memoria, proprie loquendo, non est in parte intellectiva, sed sensitiva tantum, ut philosophus probat. Sed quia intellectus non solum intelligit intelligibile, sed etiam intelligit se intelligere tale intelligibile, ideo nomen memoriae potest extendi ad notitiam, qua etsi non cognoscatur obiectum ut in praeteritione modo praedicto, cognoscitur tamen obiectum de quo etiam prius est notitia habita, inquantum aliquis scit se eam prius habuisse; et sic omnis notitia non de novo accepta potest dici memoria. Since memory, taken strictly, looks to what is past with reference to the present, it is clear that memory, properly speaking, does not belong to the intellectual part, but only to the sensitive, as the Philosopher shows. But, since intellect not only understands the intelligible thing, but also understands that it understands such an intelligible thing, the term memory can be broadened to include the knowledge by which one knows the object previously known in so far as he knows he knew it earlier, although he does not know the object as in the past in the manner earlier explained. In this way all knowledge not received for the first time can be called memory. Sed hoc contingit dupliciter: uno modo, quando consideratio secundum notitiam habitam non est intercisa, sed continua: alio vero modo, quando est intercisa; et sic habet plus de ratione praeteriti, unde et magis proprie ad rationem memoriae attingit; ut scilicet dicamur illius habere memoriam quam prius habitualiter cognoscebamus, non autem in actu. Et sic memoria est in parte intellectiva nostrae animae: et hoc modo videtur Augustinus memoriam accipere, ponens eam partem imaginis: vult enim, omne illud quod habitualiter in mente tenetur ut in actum non prodeat, ad memoriam pertinere. This can take place in two ways, either when there is continuous study based on acquired knowledge without interruption, or when the study is interrupted. The latter has more of the character of past, and so it more properly participates in the nature of memory. We have an example of this when we say that we remember a thing which previously we knew habitually but not actually. Thus, memory belongs to the intellective part of our soul. It is in this sense that Augustine seems to understand memory, when he makes it part of the image of the Trinity. For he intends to assign to memory everything in the mind which is stored there habitually without passing into act. Quomodo autem hoc possit contingere, diversimode a diversis ponitur. Avicenna enim in VI de naturalibus ponit, quod hoc non contingit (quod anima habitualiter notitiam teneat alicuius rei quam actu non considerat) ex hoc quod aliquae species actu conserventur in parte intellectiva; sed vult quod species actualiter non consideratae non possunt conservari nisi in parte sensitiva, vel quantum ad imaginationem, quae est thesaurus formarum a sensu acceptarum; vel quantum ad memoriam, quantum ad intentiones particulares non acceptas a sensibus. In intellectu vero non permanet species, nisi quando actu consideratur. Post considerationem vero in eo esse desinit: unde, quando iterum actu vult considerare aliquid, oportet quod species intelligibiles de novo fluant in intellectum possibilem ab intelligentia agente. There are various explanations of the manner in which this can take place. Avicenna holds that the fact that the soul has habitual knowledge of anything which it does not actually consider does not come from this, that certain species are retained in the intellectual part. Rather, he understands that it is impossible for the species not actually considered to be kept anywhere except in the sensitive part, either in the imagination, which is the storehouse of forms received by the senses, or in the memory, for particular apprehensions not received from the senses. The species stays in the understanding only when it is actually being considered. But, after the consideration, it ceases to be there. Thus, when one wants actually to consider something again, it is necessary for new intelligible species to flow from the agent intelligence into the possible intellect. Nec tamen sequitur, secundum ipsum, quod quandocumque aliquis de novo debet considerare quae prius scivit, oporteat eum iterum addiscere vel invenire sicut a principio, quia relicta est in eo quaedam habilitas per quam facilius se convertit ad intellectum agentem, ut ab eo species effluentes recipiat quam prius; et haec habilitas est habitus scientiae in nobis. Et secundum hanc opinionem memoria non esset in mente secundum retentionem aliquarum specierum, sed secundum habilitatem ad accipiendum de novo. However, it does not follow, according to Avicenna, that the new consideration of what was known previously necessarily entails learning or discovering all over again, for one retains a certain aptitude through which he turns more easily to the agent intellect to receive the species flowing from it than he did before. In us, this aptitude is the habit of scientific knowledge. According to this opinion, memory is not part of the mind because it preserves certain species, but because it has an aptitude for receiving them anew. Sed ista opinio non videtur rationabilis. Primo, quia cum intellectus possibilis sit stabilioris naturae quam sensus, oportet quod species in eo recepta stabilius recipiatur; unde magis possunt in eo conservari species quam in parte sensitiva. Secundo, quia intelligentia agens aequaliter se habet ad influendum species convenientes omnibus scientiis. Unde si in intellectu possibili non conservarentur aliquae species, sed sola habilitas ad convertendum se ad intellectum agentem, aequaliter remaneret homo habilis ad quodcumque intelligibile; et ita ex hoc quod homo addisceret unam scientiam, non magis sciret illam quam alias. Et praeterea, hoc videtur expresse contrarium sententiae philosophi in III de anima, qui commendat antiquos de hoc quod posuerunt animam esse locum specierum quantum ad intellectivam partem. But this does not seem to be a reasonable explanation. In the first place, since the possible intellect has a more stable nature than sense, it must receive its species more securely. Thus, the species can be better preserved in it than in the sensitive part. In the second place, the agent intelligence is equally disposed to communicate species suitable for all the sciences. As a consequence, if some species were not conserved in the possible intellect, but there were in it only the aptitude of turning to the agent intellect, man would have an equal aptitude for any intelligible thing. Therefore, from the fact that a man had learned one science he would not know it better than other sciences. Besides, this seems openly opposed to the opinion of the Philosopher, who commends the ancients for holding that the intellective part of the soul is the place of the species. Et ideo alii dicunt, quod species intelligibiles in intellectu possibili remanent post actualem considerationem, et harum ordinatio est habitus scientiae; et secundum hoc vis qua mens nostra retinere potest huiusmodi intelligibiles species post actualem considerationem, memoria dicitur: et hoc magis accedit ad propriam significationem memoriae. Therefore, others say that the intelligible species remain in the possible intellect after actual consideration, and that the ordered arrangement of these is the habit of knowledge. In this classification the power by which our minds retain these intelligible species after actual consideration will be called memory. This comes closer to the proper meaning of memory. Answers to Difficulties Ad primum igitur dicendum, quod memoria quae communis est nobis et brutis, est illa in qua conservantur particulares intentiones; et haec non est in mente, sed illa tantum in qua conservantur species intelligibiles. 1. The memory which we have in common with brute animals is that in which particular intentions are preserved. This is not in the mind; only the memory in which intelligible species are kept is there. Ad secundum dicendum, quod philosophus loquitur de memoria quae est praeteriti, prout est relatum ad hoc nunc, inquantum est hoc; et sic non est in mente. 2. The Philosopher is speaking of the memory which deals with the past as related to a particular present in so far as particular. This is not in the mind. Unde patet responsio ad tertium. 3. The answer to the third difficulty is clear from what has just been said. Ad quartum dicendum, quod in intellectu possibili differt actu apprehendere et retinere, non ex eo quod species sit in eo aliquo modo corporaliter, sed intelligibiliter tantum. Nec tamen sequitur quod semper intelligatur secundum illam speciem, sed solum quando intellectus possibilis perfecte fit in actu illius speciei. Quandoque vero est imperfecte in actu eius scilicet quodammodo medio inter puram potentiam et purum actum. Et hoc est habitualiter cognoscere: et de hoc modo cognitionis reducitur in actum perfectum per voluntatem, quae, secundum Anselmum, est motor omnium virium. 4. Actual apprehension and retention differ in the possible intellect, not because the species are there somehow in a bodily manner, but only in an intelligible way. However, it does not follow that one understands according to that species all the time, but only when the possible intellect becomes that species perfectly in act. Sometimes it has the act of this species incompletely, that is, in some way between pure potency and pure act. This is habitual knowledge. The reduction from this to complete act takes place through the will, which, according to Anselm, is the mover of all the powers. Ad quintum dicendum, quod mens est ad imaginem, praecipue secundum quod fertur in Deum et in seipsam. Ipsa autem est sibi praesens, et similiter Deus, antequam aliquae species a sensibilibus accipiantur; et praeterea mens non dicitur habere vim memorativam ex hoc quod aliquid actu teneat, sed ex hoc quod est potens tenere. 5. Mind has the character of image [of the Trinity] especially in so far as it is directed to God and to itself. It is present to itself and God is present to it before any species are received from sensible things. Furthermore, mind is not said to have the power of memory because it actually preserves something, but because it has the power to preserve something. Ad sextum patet responsio ex dictis. 6. The answer to the sixth difficulty is clear from what has been said. Ad septimum dicendum, quod nulla potentia potest aliquid cognoscere nisi convertendo se ad obiectum suum, ut visus nihil cognoscit nisi convertendo se ad colorem. Unde, cum phantasma hoc modo se habeat ad intellectum possibilem sicut sensibilia ad sensum, ut patet per philosophum in III de anima, quantumcumque aliquam speciem intelligibilem apud se intellectus habeat, nunquam tamen actu aliquid considerat secundum illam speciem, nisi convertendo se ad phantasma. Et ideo, sicut intellectus noster secundum statum viae indiget phantasmatibus ad actu considerandum antequam accipiat habitum, ita et postquam acceperit. Secus autem est de Angelis, quorum intellectus obiectum non est phantasma. 7. No power can know anything without turning to its object, as sight knows nothing unless it turns to color. Now, since phantasms are related to the possible intellect in the way that sensible things are related to sense, as the Philosopher points out, no matter to what extent an intelligible species is present to the understanding, understanding does not actually consider anything according to that species without referring to a phantasm. Therefore, just as our understanding in its present state needs phantasms actually to consider anything before it acquires a habit, so it needs them, too, after it has acquired a habit. The situation is different with angels, for phantasms are not the object of their understanding. Answers to Contrary Difficulties Ad primum vero eorum quae in contrarium obiiciuntur, dicendum, quod ex auctoritate illa haberi non potest quod in mente sit memoria nisi secundum modum praedictum, non autem quod proprie. 1. The authority cited can prove only that memory is in the mind in the way we have mentioned, not that it is there properly. Ad secundum dicendum, quod verbum Augustini est intelligendum quod memoria potest esse de praesentibus obiectis; nunquam tamen potest dici memoria nisi consideretur aliquid praeteritum, ad minus ex parte ipsius cognitionis. Et secundum hoc etiam dicitur aliquis sui oblivisci, vel memorari, inquantum de seipso, qui est praesens sibi, non conservat vel conservat praeteritam cognitionem. 2. We must understand Augustine’s statement to mean that memory can deal with present objects. However, it can never be called memory unless something past is considered, at least past with reference to cognition itself. It is in this way that we say someone, who is present to himself, forgets or remembers himself because he retains or does not retain the past knowledge about himself. Ad tertium dicendum, quod inquantum intellectus cognoscit differentias temporum secundum communes rationes, sic formare potest compositiones secundum quamlibet temporis differentiam. 3. In so far as understanding knows temporal differences through common characters, it can thus make judgments according to any difference of time. Ad quartum dicendum, quod providentia non est in intellectu nisi secundum generales rationes futuri; sed ad particularia applicatur mediante ratione particulari, quam oportet mediam intercedere inter rationem universalem moventem et motum qui in particularibus consequitur, ut patet per philosophum in III de anima. 14. Foresight is in the understanding only according to general considerations about the future. It is applied to particular things through the mediation of particular reason which must act as the medium between general reason, which is the source of movement, and the movement which follows in particular things, as is clear from what the Philosopher says. ARTICLE III\n\nIn the third article we ask:\n\nIs memory distinguished from understanding as one power from another?\n\n[ARTICLE I Sent., 3, 4, 1; S.T., II, 74; S.T., I, 79, 7; 93, 7, ad 3.] Tertio quaeritur utrum memoria distinguatur ab intelligentia sicut potentia a potentia Difficulties Et videtur quod non. It seems that it is not, for Diversarum enim potentiarum sunt diversi actus. Sed intellectus possibilis et memoriae, prout in mente ponitur, est idem actus, qui est species retinere; hoc enim Augustinus memoriae, philosophus autem intellectui possibili attribuit. Ergo memoria non distinguitur ab intelligentia sicut potentia a potentia. 1. Different acts belong to different powers. But the possible intellect and memory, as part of the mind, are said to have the same act, to preserve the species. For Augustine assigns this function to memory and the Philosopher assigns it to the possible intellect. Therefore, memory is not distinguished from understanding as one power from another. Praeterea, accipere aliquid non concernendo aliquam temporis differentiam, est proprium intellectus, qui abstrahit ab hic et nunc. Sed memoria non concernit aliquam differentiam temporis, quia, secundum Augustinum, XIV de Trinit., memoria est communiter praeteritorum, praesentium, et futurorum. Ergo memoria ab intellectu non distinguitur. 2. To receive something without paying attention to any difference of time belongs properly to understanding, which abstracts from the here and now. But memory pays no attention to difference of time, for, according to Augustine, memory deals indifferently with things present, past, and future. Therefore, memory is not distinguished from understanding. Praeterea, intelligentia accipitur dupliciter secundum Augustinum, XIV de Trinit. Uno modo prout dicimur intelligere illud quod actu cogitamus; alio modo prout dicimur intelligere illud quod non actu consideramus. Sed intelligentia, secundum quam id tantum dicimur intelligere quod actu cogitamus, est intelligere in actu; quod non est potentia, sed operatio alicuius potentiae; et sic non distinguitur a memoria sicut potentia a potentia. Secundum vero quod intelligimus ea quae non actu cogitamus, nullo modo a memoria distinguitur, sed ad memoriam pertinet; quod patet per Augustinum, XIV de Trinitate, ubi sic dicit: si nos referamus ad interiorem mentis memoriam, qua sui meminit, et interiorem intelligentiam, qua se intelligit et interiorem voluntatem, qua se diligit; ubi haec tria simul semper sunt, sive cogitarentur, sive non cogitarentur; videtur quidem imago Trinitatis ad solam memoriam pertinere. Ergo intelligentia nullo modo distinguitur a memoria sicut potentia a potentia. 3. According to Augustine, intelligence can be taken in two ways. According to the first, we are said to understand that which we actually think. According to the second, we are said to understand that which we do not actually consider. But intelligence, in the meaning of understanding only that which we actually think, is understanding in act. This is not a power, but the activity of a power; hence, it is not distinguished from memory as a power from a power. But, in so far as we understand those things which we do not actually consider, understanding is not in any way distinguished from memory, but belongs to it. This is clear from Augustine: “If we look to the inner memory of the mind by which it remembers itself, to the inner understanding by which it understands itself, and to the inner will by which it loves itself, where these three are always together, whether they are thought about or not, we will see that the image of the Trinity belongs only to the memory.” Therefore, understanding is in no way distinguished from memory as a power from a power. Si dicatur, quod intelligentia est quaedam potentia secundum quam anima est potens actu cogitare, et sic etiam intelligentia, qua non dicimur intelligere nisi cogitantes, distinguitur a memoria sicut potentia a potentia. Contra: eiusdem potentiae est habitum habere, et uti habitu. Sed intelligere non cogitando, est intelligere in habitu; intelligere autem cogitando, est uti habitu. Ergo ad eamdem potentiam pertinet intelligere non cogitando, et intelligere cogitando: et sic per hoc non diversificatur intelligentia a memoria sicut potentia a potentia. 4. Someone may say that intelligence is a power through which the soul is able actually to think, and so, also, that the intelligence through which we are said to understand only when we are thinking is distinguished from memory as one power from another.—On the contrary, it belongs to the same power to have a habit and to use that habit. But to understand when not thinking is to understand habitually, whereas to understand when thinking is to use the habit. Therefore, to understand when not thinking and to understand when thinking belong to the same power. And so, for this reason, understanding does not differ from memory as one power from another. Praeterea in intellectiva parte animae non invenitur aliqua potentia nisi cognitiva et motiva vel affectiva. Sed voluntas est affectiva vel motiva; intelligentia autem est cognitiva. Ergo memoria non est alia potentia ab intelligentia. 5. In the intellective part of the soul there are only the cognoscitive and motive, or affective, powers. But the will is the affective or motive; understanding, the cognoscitive. Therefore, memory is not a different power from understanding. Sed contra. To the Contrary Est quod Augustinus dicit, XIV de Trin., quod secundum hoc anima est ad imaginem Dei quod uti ratione atque intellectu ad intelligendum Deum et conspiciendum potest. Sed potest anima conspicere secundum potentiam. Ergo imago in anima attenditur secundum potentias. Sed imago in anima attenditur secundum quod haec tria in ea inveniuntur, memoria, intelligentia, et voluntas. Ergo haec tria sunt tres potentiae distinctae. 1. Augustine says that “the soul partakes of the image of God in this, that it can use reason and understanding to know and see God.” But the soul can see through its powers. Therefore, the image in the soul is considered according to its powers. But the image in the soul is considered according to the presence of memory, understanding, and will in the soul. Therefore, these three are three distinct powers. Praeterea, si ista tria non sunt tres potentiae, oportet aliquod eorum esse actum sive operationem. Sed actus non semper est in anima; non enim semper actu intelligit vel vult. Ergo ista tria non semper erunt in anima; et sic non semper erit anima ad imaginem Dei, quod est contra Augustinum. 2. If these are not three powers, there must be one of them which is act or activity. But act is not always in the soul, for one does not always actually understand or will. Therefore, these three will not always be in the soul, and consequently the soul will not always be in the image of God, contrary to Augustine. Praeterea, inter haec tria invenitur aequalitas, per quam aequalitas divinarum personarum repraesentatur. Sed inter actum et habitum vel potentiam non invenitur aequalitas; quia ad plura se extendit potentia quam habitus, et habitus quam actus; quia unius potentiae sunt plures habitus, et ab uno habitu plures actus eliciuntur. Ergo non potest esse quod aliquod eorum sit habitus, et aliud actus. 3. There is a certain equality among these three which portrays the equality of the divine Persons. But there is no equality among act, habit, and power, because power embraces more than habit and habit more than act. For many habits belong to one power, and many acts can come from one habit. Therefore, one of these cannot be habit and another act. Responsio. REPLY Dicendum, quod imago Trinitatis in anima potest assignari dupliciter: uno modo secundum perfectam imitationem Trinitatis; alio modo secundum imperfectam. We must say that the image of the Trinity in the soul can be predicated in two ways: one in which there is perfect imitation of the Trinity, the other in which the imitation is imperfect. Anima quidem perfecte Trinitatem imitatur secundum quod meminit, intelligit actu, et vult actu. Quod ideo est, quia in illa Trinitate increata, media in Trinitate persona est verbum. Verbum autem esse non potest sine actuali cognitione. Unde secundum hunc modum perfectae imitationis assignat Augustinus imaginem in his tribus: memoria, intelligentia et voluntate; prout memoria importat habitualem notitiam, intelligentia vero actualem cogitationem ex illa notitia prodeuntem, voluntas vero actualem voluntatis motum ex cogitatione procedentem. Et hoc expresse patet ex hoc quod dicit in XIV de Trinit., sic dicens: quia ibi, scilicet in mente, verbum esse sine cogitatione non potest (cogitamus enim omne quod dicimus illo interiori verbo, quod ad nullius gentis pertinet linguam); in tribus potius illis imago ista cognoscitur memoria scilicet, intelligentia, voluntate. Hanc autem nunc dico intelligentiam, qua intelligimus cogitantes; et eam voluntatem, quae istam prolem parentemque coniungit. For the mind perfectly imitates the Trinity in this, that it actually remembers, actually understands, and actually wills. This is so because in the uncreated Trinity the middle Person is the Word. Now, there can be a word only with actual cognition. Hence, it is according to this kind of perfect imitation that Augustine puts the image in memory, understanding, and will. In it, memory refers to habitual knowledge, understanding to actual cognition which proceeds from the habitual knowledge of memory, and will to the actual movement of the will which proceeds from thought. This appears expressly from what he says in The Trinity: “Since the word cannot be there,” in the mind, “without thought; for everything which we speak we think with that internal word which belongs to the language of no people, the image is found especially in those three: memory, intelligence, and will. Intelligence I now call that by which we understand when thinking; I call that will which joins this offspring [thought] with its parent [intelligence].” Imago vero secundum imperfectam imitationem est, quando assignatur secundum habitus et potentias; et sic assignat Trinitatis imaginem in anima, IX de Trinitate, quantum ad haec tria, mens, notitia et amor; ut mens nominet potentiam, notitia vero et amor habitus in ea existentes. Et sicut posuit notitiam, ita ponere potuisset intelligentiam habitualem: utrumque enim habitualiter accipi potest, ut patet ex hoc quod dicit in libro XIV de Trinitate: numquid recte possumus dicere: iste musicus novit quidem musicam; sed nunc eam non intelligit, quia eam non cogitat; intelligit vero nunc geometriam, hanc enim nunc cogitat? Absurda est quantum apparet, ista sententia. Et sic secundum hanc assignationem haec duo, quae sunt notitia, et amor, habitualiter accepta, ad memoriam tantum pertinent, ut patet per auctoritatem eiusdem in obiiciendo inductam. We have the image in which there is imperfect imitation when we designate it according to habits and powers. It is thus that Augustine bases the image of the Trinity in the soul upon mind, knowledge, and love. Here, mind means the power; knowledge and love, the habits existing in it. In place of knowledge he could have said habitual intelligence, for both can be taken in the sense of habit. This is clear from The Trinity, where he says: “Can we correctly say that the musician knows music, but he does not now understand it because he is not now thinking about it, or that he now understands geometry because he is now thinking about it? This opinion is obviously absurd.” So, in this sense, knowledge and love, taken as habitual, belong only to memory, as is clear from the authoritative citation from Augustine in the objections.” Sed quia actus sunt in potentiis radicaliter sicut effectus in causis; ideo etiam perfecta imitatio, quae est secundum memoriam, intelligentiam actualem et voluntatem actualem, potest originaliter inveniri in potentiis, secundum quas anima potest meminisse, intelligere actualiter et velle, ut per verba Augustini inducta patet. Et sic imago attendetur secundum potentias; non tamen hoc modo quod memoria possit esse, in mente, alia potentia praeter intelligentiam: quod sic patet. But, since acts have radical existence in powers, as effects in their causes, even perfect imitation according to memory, understanding in act, and will in act can in the first instance be found in the powers through which the soul can remember, actually understand and will, as the citation from Augustine shows. Thus, the image will be based upon the powers, though not in the sense that in the mind memory could be some power besides the understanding. This is clear from what follows. Potentiae enim non diversificantur ex diversitate obiectorum nisi diversitas obiectorum sit ex his quae per se accidunt obiectis, secundum quod sunt talium potentiarum obiecta; unde calidum et frigidum, quae colorato accidunt, inquantum huiusmodi, non diversificant potentiam visivam: eiusdem enim visivae potentiae est videre coloratum calidum et frigidum, dulce et amarum. Quamvis autem mens sive intellectus aliquo modo cognoscere possit praeteritum, tamen, cum indifferenter se habeat ad cognoscenda praesentia, praeterita et futura; differentia praesentis et praeteriti est accidentalis intelligibili inquantum huiusmodi. Unde, quamvis in mente aliquo modo possit esse memoria, non tamen potest esse ut potentia quaedam per se distincta ab aliis, per modum quo philosophi de distinctione potentiarum loquuntur; sed hoc modo solummodo inveniri potest memoria in parte animae sensitiva, quae fertur ad praesens inquantum est praesens; unde, si debeat ferri in praeteritum, requiritur aliqua altior virtus quam ipse sensus. Diversity of objects is the source of differentiation of powers only when the diversity comes from those things which of themselves belong to the objects, in so far as they are objects of such powers. Thus, hot and cold in something colored do not, as such, differentiate the power of sight. For the same power of sight can see what is colored, whether hot or cold, sweet or bitter. Now, although mind or understanding can in a certain way know what is past, still, since it relates indifferently to knowledge of present, past, and future, the difference of past and present is accidental to what is intelligible, in so far as it is intelligible. For this reason, although memory can be in the mind in a certain way, it cannot be there as a power distinct of itself from other powers in the way in which philosophers speak of the distinction of powers. In this way, memory can be found only in the sensitive part, which is referred to the present as present. For this reason, a higher power than that of sense is needed if it is to relate to the past. Nihilominus tamen, etsi memoria non sit potentia distincta ab intelligentia, prout intelligentia sumitur pro potentia, tamen invenitur Trinitas in anima etiam considerando ipsas potentias, secundum quod una potentia, quae est intellectus, habet habitudinem ad diversa, scilicet ad tenendum notitiam alicuius habitualiter et ad considerandum illud actualiter, sicut etiam Augustinus, distinguit rationem inferiorem a superiori secundum habitudinem ad diversa. Nevertheless, although memory is not a power distinct from intelligence, taken as a power, the Trinity is still in the soul if we consider those powers in so far as the one power of understanding has an orientation to different things, namely, habitually to keep the knowledge of something, and actually to consider it. It is in this way that Augustine distinguishes lower from higher reason, according to an orientation to different things. Answers to Difficulties Ad primum igitur dicendum, quod quamvis memoria, prout est in mente, non sit alia potentia ab intellectu possibili distincta; tamen inter intellectum possibilem et memoriam invenitur distinctio secundum habitudinem ad diversa, ut ex dictis patet. Ad primum vero in contrarium dicendum, quod Augustinus ibi loquitur de imagine inventa in anima, non secundum perfectam imitationem, quae est quando actu imitatur Trinitatem intelligendo eam. 1. Although memory as belonging to the mind is not a power distinct from the possible intellect, there is a distinction between memory and possible intellect according to orientation to different things, as we have said. Et similiter dicendum est ad quatuor sequentia. 2. The same answer can be given to the four following difficulties. Answers to Contrary Difficulties Ad primum vero in contrarium dicendum, quod Augustinus ibi loquitur de imagine inventa in anima, non secundum perfectam imitationem, quae est quando actu imitatur Trinitatem intelligendo eam. l. In the passage cited, Augustine is not talking about the image which is in the soul according to perfect imitation. This is present when the soul actually imitates the Trinity by understanding It. Ad secundum dicendum, quod semper est in anima imago Trinitatis aliquo modo, sed non secundum perfectam imitationem. 2. In the soul there is always an image of the Trinity in some way, but not always according to perfect imitation. Ad tertium dicendum, quod inter potentiam et actum et habitum potest esse aequalitas secundum quod comparantur ad unum obiectum; et sic imago Trinitatis invenitur in anima secundum quod fertur in Deum. Et tamen, etiam communiter loquendo de potentia, habitu et actu, invenitur in eis aequalitas, non quidem secundum proprietatem naturae, quia alterius modi habet esse operatio, habitus et potentia; sed secundum comparationem ad actum, secundum quam consideratur horum trium quantitas: nec oportet quod accipiatur unus actus tantum numero, aut unus habitus, sed habitus et actus in genere. 3. Between power, act, and habit there can be equality inasmuch as they are referred to one object. Thus, the image of the Trinity is in the soul inasmuch as it is directed to God. Still, even in the ordinary way of speaking about power, habit, and act, there is an equality among them. However, this equality does not follow the distinctive character of the nature, because activity, habit, and power have the act of existence in different ways. But it does follow the relation to act according to which we consider the quantity of these three. It is not necessary to consider only one act numerically, or one habit, but habit and act in general. ARTICLE VI\n\nIn the sixth article we ask:\n\nDoes the human mind receive knowledge from sensible things?\n\n[ARTICLE De ver., 19, 1; Quodl., VIII, 2, 3; S.T., I, 84, 6; Q.D. de anima, 15; Comp. Theol., cc. 81-82.] Sexto quaeritur utrum mens humana cognitionem accipiat a sensibilibus Difficulties Et videtur quod non. It seems that it does not, for Eorum enim quae non communicant in materia, non potest esse actio et passio, ut per Boetium in Lib. de duabus naturis patet et per philosophum in libro de generatione. Sed mens nostra non communicat in materia cum rebus sensibilibus. Ergo non possunt sensibilia agere in mentem nostram, ut ex eis menti nostrae aliqua cognitio imprimatur. 1. Action and passion cannot take place between things unless both are material, as is clear from Boethius, and also from the Philosopher. But our mind does not share in matter with sensible things. Therefore, sensible things cannot act on our mind to imprint knowledge on it. Praeterea, obiectum intellectus est quid, ut dicitur in III de anima. Sed quidditas rei nullo sensu percipitur. Ergo cognitio mentis a sensu non accipitur. 2. What a thing is, is the object of intellect, as is said in The Soul. But the quiddity of a thing is not perceived by any sense. Therefore, mental cognition is not received from sense. Praeterea, Augustinus dicit, X confessionum, loquens de cognitione intelligibilium, quomodo a nobis acquiratur: ibi, inquit, erant, scilicet intelligibilia in mente nostra; et antequam ea didicissem, sed in memoria non erant. Ergo videtur quod intelligibiles species non sint in mente a sensibus acceptae. 3. When speaking of the way in which we acquire cognition of intelligible things, Augustine says: “They were there” that is, intelligibles in our mind, “before I learned them, but they were not in my memory. Therefore, it seems that intelligible species are not received in the mind from the senses. Praeterea, sicut Augustinus probat in X de Trinitate, anima non potest amare nisi cognita. Sed aliquis antequam aliquam scientiam addiscat, amat eam; quod patet ex hoc quod multo studio eam quaerit. Ergo antequam addiscat illam scientiam, habet eam in notitia sua; ergo videtur quod non accipiat mens cognitionem a rebus sensibilibus. 4. Augustine proves that the soul can love only what it knows. But one loves a science before he learns it, as is clear from the eagerness with which he seeks this knowledge. Therefore, before he learns such a science, he has some acquaintance with it. So, it seems that the mind does not receive knowledge from sensible things. Praeterea, Augustinus dicit, XII super Genesim ad litteram: corporis imaginem non corpus in spiritu, sed ipse spiritus in seipso facit celeritate mirabili, quae ineffabiliter longe est a corporis tarditate. Ergo videtur quod mens non accipiat species intelligibiles a sensibus, sed ipsa eas in se formet. 5. Augustine says: “The body does not make the image of the body in the spirit. Rather, the spirit itself with a wonderful swiftness which is ineffably far from the slowness of the body makes in itself the image of the body.” Therefore, it seems that the mind does not receive intelligible species from sensible things but constructs them in itself. Praeterea, Augustinus dicit, XII de Trinitate, quod mens nostra de rebus corporalibus iudicat secundum rationes incorporales et sempiternas. Sed rationes a sensu acceptae non sunt huiusmodi; ergo videtur quod mens humana non accipiat cognitionem a sensibilibus. 6. Augustine says that our mind judges about bodily things through non-bodily and eternal principles. But principles received from the senses are not of this kind. Therefore, it seems that the human mind does not receive knowledge from sensible things. Praeterea, si mens cognitionem a sensibilibus accipiat, hoc non potest esse nisi inquantum species quae a sensibilibus accipitur, intellectum possibilem movet. Sed talis species non potest movere intellectum possibilem. Non enim movet ipsum in phantasia adhuc existens, quia ibi existens nondum est actu intelligibilis, sed potentia tantum; intellectus autem non movetur nisi ab intelligibili actu, sicut nec visus nisi a visibili in actu; similiter nec movet intellectum possibilem existens in intellectu agente, qui nullius speciei est receptivus, alias non differret ab intellectu possibili; similiter nec existens in ipso possibili intellectu, quia forma iam inhaerens subiecto subiectum non movet, sed in ipso quodammodo quiescit; nec etiam per se existens, cum species intelligibiles non sint substantiae, sed de genere accidentium, ut dicit Avicenna in sua metaphysica. Ergo nullo modo esse potest ut mens nostra a sensibilibus accipiat scientiam. 7. If the mind receives knowledge from sensible things, it must do so because the species received from sensible things set the possible intellect in motion. But such species cannot influence the possible intellect. For, when they are in the imagination, they are not intelligible actually, but only potentially, and so cannot set the possible intellect in motion. The intellect, however, is moved only by something actually intelligible, just as the power of sight is moved only by something actually visible. Similarly, something existing in the agent intellect cannot move the possible intellect, because the agent intellect does not receive species. If it did, it would not differ from the possible intellect. Again, these representations do not actuate the possible intellect by existing in it, for a form already adhering in a subject does not set the subject in motion, but is, as it were, at rest in it. Finally, they do not cause movement in the possible intellect by existing of themselves, for intelligible species are not substances, but belong to the class of accidents, as Avicenna says. Therefore, in no way can our mind receive knowledge from sensible things. Praeterea, agens est nobilius patiente, ut patet per Augustinum, XII super Genesim ad litteram, et per philosophum in III de anima. Sed recipiens se habet ad illud a quo recipit quasi patiens ad agens. Cum ergo mens sit multo nobilior sensibilibus et sensibus ipsis, non poterit ab eis cognitionem accipere. 8. The agent is more noble than the patient, as is clear from Augustine and from the Philosopher. But the receiver is related to that which it receives, as a patient is related to the agent. Since, therefore, the mind is much more noble than sensible things and the senses themselves, it cannot receive knowledge from them. Praeterea, philosophus dicit in VII Phys., quod anima in quiescendo fit sciens et prudens. Sed anima non posset accipere scientiam a sensibilibus, nisi moveretur aliquo modo ab eis. Ergo anima non accipit scientiam a sensibilibus. 9. The Philosopher says” that the soul comes to acquire knowledge and prudence by coming to rest. But the soul cannot receive knowledge from sensible things unless it be somehow set in motion by them. Therefore, the soul does not receive knowledge from sensible things. Sed contra. To the Contrary Sicut dicit philosophus, et experimento probatur, cui deficit unus sensus, deest una scientia, sicut caecis deest scientia de coloribus. Hoc autem non esset, si anima aliunde acciperet scientiam quam per sensus. Ergo a sensibilibus per sensus cognitionem accipit. 1. As the Philosopher says, and as experience proves, one who lacks a sense is deprived of one kind of knowledge, as the blind have no knowledge of colors. This would not happen if the soul received knowledge from a source other than the senses. Therefore, the soul receives knowledge from sensible objects through the senses. Praeterea, omnis nostra cognitio originaliter consistit in notitia primorum principiorum indemonstrabilium. Horum autem cognitio in nobis a sensu oritur, ut patet in fine Poster. Ergo scientia nostra a sensu oritur. 2. At first, all our cognition consists in the knowledge of first undeducible principles. But the cognition of these arises in us from sense, as is clear from the Posterior Analytics. Therefore, all our knowledge arises from sense. Praeterea, natura nihil facit frustra, nec deficit in necessariis. Frustra autem dati essent sensus animae, nisi per eos cognitionem de rebus acciperet. Ergo mens nostra a sensibilibus cognitionem accipit. 3. Nature does nothing to no purpose and does not fail in necessary matters. But senses would have been given to the soul to no purpose unless the soul received cognition from things through them. Therefore, our mind receives knowledge from sensible things. Responsio. REPLY Dicendum, quod circa hanc quaestionem multiplex fuit antiquorum opinio. The views of the ancients on this question are manifold. Some held that our knowledge derived completely from an external cause separated from matter. There are two explanations of this position. Quidam enim posuerunt ortum scientiae nostrae totaliter a causa exteriori esse, quae est a materia separata: quae in duas sectas dividitur. Quidam enim, ut Platonici, posuerunt formas rerum sensibilium esse a materia separatas, et sic esse intelligibiles actu, et per earum participationem a materia sensibili effici individua in natura; earum vero participatione humanas mentes scientiam habere. Et sic ponebant formas praedictas esse principium generationis et scientiae, ut philosophus narrat in I Metaph. Sed haec positio a philosopho sufficienter reprobata est; qui ostendit quod non est ponere formas sensibilium rerum nisi in materia sensibili, cum etiam nec sine materia sensibili in universali formae naturales intelligi possint, sicut nec simus sine naso. Some, as the Platonists, held that the forms of sensible thing existed apart from matter and so were actually intelligible. According to them, real individuals come about through the participation by sensible matter in these forms, and the human mind has knowledge by sharing in them. Thus, these forms are the principle of generation and knowledge, as the Philosopher says. But the Philosopher has adequately confuted this position by showing that sensible forms must exist in sensible matter, and that sensible matter in general is necessary for the understanding of physical forms, just as there is no snub without nose. Et ideo alii non ponentes formas sensibilium separatas, sed intelligentias tantum, quas nos Angelos dicimus, posuerunt originem nostrae scientiae totaliter ab huiusmodi substantiis separatis esse. Unde Avicenna voluit, quod sicut formae sensibiles non acquiruntur in materia sensibili nisi ex influentia intelligentiae agentis, ita nec formae intelligibiles humanis mentibus imprimuntur nisi ex intelligentia agente, quae non est pars animae, sed substantia separata, ut ipse ponit. Indiget tamen anima sensibus quasi excitantibus et disponentibus ad scientiam; sicut agentia inferiora praeparant materiam ad suscipiendum formam ab intelligentia agente. For this reason, others, bypassing separated forms of sensible things, demanded only intelligences, which we call angels, and made separated substances of this sort the sole source of our knowledge. Accordingly, Avicenna holds that just as sensible forms are not received into sensible matter except through the influence of the agent intelligence, so, too, intelligible forms are not imprinted on human minds except by the agent intelligence, which for him is not a part of the soul, but a separated substance. However, the soul needs the senses to prepare the way and stimulate it to knowledge, just as the lower agents prepare matter to receive form from the agent intelligence. Sed ista etiam opinio non videtur rationabilis: quia secundum hoc non esset necessaria dependentia inter cognitionem mentis humanae et virtutes sensitivas; cuius contrarium manifeste apparet: tum ex hoc quod deficiente sensu deficit scientia de suis sensibilibus, tum etiam ex hoc quod mens nostra non potest actu considerare etiam ea quae habitualiter scit, nisi formando aliqua phantasmata; unde etiam laeso organo phantasiae impeditur consideratio. Et praeterea praedicta positio tollit proxima rerum principia, si omnia inferiora ex substantia separata immediate formas consequuntur tam intelligibiles quam sensibiles. But this opinion does not seem reasonable, because, according to it, there is no necessary interdependence of the human mind and the sensitive powers. The opposite seems quite clear both from the fact that, when a given sense is missing, we have no knowledge of its sensible objects, and from the fact that our mind cannot actually consider even those things which it knows habitually unless it forms some phantasms. Thus, an injury to the organ of imagination hinders consideration. Furthermore, the explanation just given does away with the proximate principles of things, inasmuch as all lower things would derive their intelligible and sensible forms immediately from a separated substance. Alia opinio fuit ponentium nostrae scientiae originem totaliter a causa interiori esse: quae etiam in duas sectas dividitur. Quidam enim posuerunt humanas animas in seipsis continere omnium rerum notitiam; sed per coniunctionem ad corpus praedictam notitiam obtenebrari. Et ideo dicebant nos indigere sensibus et studio, ut impedimenta scientiae tollerentur; dicentes, addiscere, nihil aliud esse quam reminisci; sicut etiam manifeste apparet quod ex his quae audimus vel videmus, reminiscimur ea quae prius sciebamus. Sed haec positio non videtur etiam rationabilis. Si enim coniunctio animae ad corpus sit naturalis, non potest esse quod per eam totaliter naturalis scientia impediretur: et ita, si haec opinio vera esset, non pateremur omnimodam ignorantiam eorum quorum sensum non habemus. Esset autem opinio consona illi positioni quae ponit animas ante corpora fuisse creatas, et postmodum corporibus unitas; quia tunc compositio corporis et animae non esset naturalis, sed accidentaliter proveniens ipsi animae. Quae quidem opinio et secundum fidem et secundum philosophorum sententias reprobanda iudicatur. A second explanation has been given by those who make an inferior cause the complete source of our knowledge. There are also two explanations; of this position. Some held that human souls had within themselves knowledge of all things, but that this cognition was darkened by union with the body. Therefore, they said that we need assiduous use of the senses to remove the hindrance to knowledge. Learning, they said, is nothing but remembering, as is abundantly clear from the way in which those things which we have seen and heard make us remember what we formerly knew. But this position does not seem reasonable. For, if the union of soul and body is natural, it cannot wholly hinder natural knowledge. And if this opinion be true, we would not be subject to the complete ignorance of those objects which demand a sense faculty of which one is deprived. This opinion would fit in with the theory that holds that souls were created before bodies and later united to them. Then, the conjunction d body and soul would not be natural, but only an accidental accretion to the soul. This opinion must be rejected on the score both of faith and philosophic tenets. Alii vero dixerunt, quod anima sibi ipsi est scientiae causa: non enim a sensibilibus scientiam accipit quasi per actionem sensibilium aliquo modo similitudines rerum ad animam perveniant; sed ipsa anima ad praesentiam sensibilium in se similitudines sensibilium format. Sed haec etiam positio non videtur totaliter rationabilis. Nullum enim agens, nisi secundum quod est actu, agit; unde si anima in se format omnium rerum similitudines, oportet quod ipsa in se actu habeat illas similitudines rerum; et sic redibit in praedictam opinionem, quae ponit omnium rerum scientiam animae humanae naturaliter insitam esse. Other proponents of this second opinion said that the soul is the cause of its own knowledge. For it does not receive knowledge from sensible things as if likenesses of things somehow reached the soul because of the activity of sensible things, but the soul itself, in the presence of sensible things, constructs in itself the likenesses of sensible things. But this statement does not seem altogether reasonable. For no agent acts except in so far as it is in act. Thus, if the soul formed the likenesses of all things in itself, it would be necessary for the soul to have those likenesses of things actually within itself. This would be a return to the previous opinion which held that the knowledge of all things is naturally present in the human soul. Et ideo prae omnibus praedictis positionibus rationabilior est sententia philosophi, qui ponit scientiam mentis nostrae partim ab intrinseco et partim ab extrinseco esse; non solum a rebus a materia separatis, sed etiam ab ipsis sensibilibus. Cum enim mens nostra comparatur ad res sensibiles quae sunt extra animam, invenitur se habere ad eas in duplici habitudine. Uno modo ut actus ad potentiam: inquantum, scilicet, res quae sunt extra animam sunt intelligibiles in potentia. Ipsa vero mens est intelligibilis in actu; et secundum hoc ponitur in anima intellectus agens, qui faciat intelligibilia in potentia esse intelligibilia in actu. Alio modo ut potentia ad actum: prout scilicet in mente nostra formae rerum determinatae, sunt in potentia tantum, quae in rebus extra animam sunt in actu; et secundum hoc ponitur in anima nostra intellectus possibilis, cuius est recipere formas a rebus sensibilibus abstractas, factas intelligibiles in actu per lumen intellectus agentis. Quod quidem lumen intellectus agentis in anima procedit, sicut a prima origine, a substantiis separatis et praecipue a Deo. Therefore, the opinion of the Philosopher is more reasonable than any of the foregoing positions. He attributes the knowledge of our mind partly to intrinsic, partly to extrinsic, influence. Not only things separated from matter, but also sensible things themselves, play their part. For, when our mind is considered in relation to sensible things outside the soul, it is found to be related to them in a twofold manner. In one way, it is related as act to potency, to the extent that things outside the mind are only potentially intelligible. The mind itself, however, is intelligible in act, and it is on this basis that the agent intellect, which makes potentially intelligible things actually intelligible, is held to be included in the soul. In another way, it is related to things as potency to act, inasmuch as determined forms of things are only potentially in our mind, but actually in things outside the soul. In this respect our soul includes the possible intellect, whose function it is to receive forms abstracted from sensible things and made actually intelligible through the light of the agent intellect. This light of the agent intellect comes to the soul from the separated substances and especially from God as from its first source. Et secundum hoc, verum est quod scientiam mens nostra a sensibilibus accipit; nihilominus tamen ipsa anima in se similitudines rerum format, inquantum per lumen intellectus agentis efficiuntur formae a sensibilibus abstractae intelligibiles actu, ut in intellectu possibili recipi possint. Et sic etiam in lumine intellectus agentis nobis est quodammodo originaliter omnis scientia originaliter indita, mediantibus universalibus conceptionibus, quae statim lumine intellectus agentis cognoscuntur, per quas sicut per universalia principia iudicamus de aliis, et ea praecognoscimus in ipsis. Ut secundum hoc etiam illa opinio veritatem habeat quae ponit, nos ea quae addiscimus, ante in notitia habuisse. Accordingly, it is true that our mind receives knowledge from sensible things; nevertheless, the soul itself forms in itself likenesses of things, inasmuch as through the light of the agent intellect the forms abstracted from sensible things are made actually intelligible so that they may be received in the possible intellect. And in this way all knowledge is in a certain sense implanted in us from the beginning (since we have the light of the agent intellect) through the medium of universal conceptions which are immediately known by the light of the agent intellect. These serve as universal principles through which we judge about other things, and in which we foreknow these others. In this respect, that opinion is true which holds that we previously had in our knowledge those things which we learn. Answers to Difficulties Ad primum igitur dicendum, quod formae sensibiles, vel a sensibilibus abstractae, non possunt agere in mentem nostram, nisi quatenus per lumen intellectus agentis immateriales redduntur, et sic efficiuntur quodammodo homogeneae intellectui possibili in quem agunt. 1. Sensible forms, those, namely, which are abstracted from sensible things, cannot act on our mind unless they are rendered immaterial through the light of the agent intellect, and thus in some way are made homogeneous with the possible intellect on which they must act. Ad secundum dicendum, quod circa idem virtus superior et inferior operantur, non similiter, sed superior sublimius; unde et per formam quae a rebus recipitur, sensus non ita efficaciter rem cognoscit sicut intellectus: sed sensus per eam manuducitur in cognitionem exteriorum accidentium; intellectus vero pervenit ad nudam quidditatem rei, secernendo eam ab omnibus materialibus dispositionibus unde non pro tanto dicitur cognitio mentis a sensu originem habere, quod omne illud quod mens cognoscit, sensus apprehendat; sed quia ex his quae sensus apprehendit, mens in aliqua ulteriora manuducitur, sicut etiam sensibilia intellecta manuducunt in intelligibilia divinorum. 2. A higher and lower power do not operate in the same way even in respect to the same thing, but the higher power acts more nobly. Thus, when sense knows a thing through a form received from things, it does not know it so effectively as the intellect. Sense is led through it to a knowledge of the external accidents; the intellect reaches to the bare quiddity of the thing, distinguishing it from all material dispositions. Thus, when the mental knowing is said to take its origin from sense, this does not mean that sense apprehends all that the mind knows, but that, from those things which sense apprehends, the mind is led on to something more, just as the intellectual knowledge of sensible things leads to knowledge of divine things. Ad tertium dicendum, quod verbum Augustini est referendum ad praecognitionem qua particularia in principiis universalibus praecognoscuntur; sic enim verum est quod ea quae addiscimus, prius in anima nostra erant. 3. The statement from Augustine refers to that precognition by which we know particulars in universal principles. In this sense it is true that what we learn is already in our soul. Ad quartum dicendum, quod aliquis antequam aliquam scientiam acquirat, amare eam potest, inquantum eam cognoscit quadam cognitione universali, cognoscendo utilitatem illius scientiae, vel visu, vel quocumque alio modo. 4. One can love scientific knowledge before he acquires it in so far as he has some general acquaintance with it by sight, or by knowing its usefulness, or in some other way. Ad quintum dicendum, quod secundum hoc intelligenda est anima seipsam formare, quod per actionem intellectus agentis formae intelligibiles factae intellectum possibilem formant, ut dictum est; et secundum quod etiam vis imaginativa potest formare diversorum sensibilium formas; quod praecipue apparet dum imaginamur ea quae nunquam sensu percepimus. 5. The soul is to be understood to fashion itself in this sense, that the forms which arise from the activity of the agent intellect determine the possible intellect, as has been said. And in this sense, too, the imaginative power can fashion the forms of different sensible objects, as especially appears when we imagine things which we have never perceived by sense. Ad sextum dicendum, quod prima principia quorum cognitio est nobis innata, sunt quaedam similitudines increatae veritatis; unde secundum quod per ea de aliis iudicamus, dicimur iudicare de rebus per rationes incommutabiles, vel per veritatem increatam. Hoc tamen quod Augustinus ibi dicit, referendum est ad rationem superiorem, quae aeternis contemplandis inhaeret; quae quidem, quamvis sit dignitate prior, est tamen eius operatio tempore posterior, quia invisibilia per ea quae facta sunt, intellecta, conspiciuntur, Rom. I, 20. 6. The first principles of which we have innate cognition are certain likenesses of uncreated truth. When we judge about other things through these likenesses, we are said to judge about things through unchangeable principles or through uncreated truth. Nevertheless, we should refer this statement of Augustine to higher reason, which confines itself to the contemplation of eternal truths. Although this higher reason is first in dignity, its operation is subsequent in time: “For the invisible things of him [God]... are clearly seen, being understood by the things that are made” (Romans 1:20). Ad septimum dicendum, quod in receptione qua intellectus possibilis species rerum accipit a phantasmatibus, se habent phantasmata ut agens instrumentale vel secundarium; intellectus vero agens ut agens principale et primum. Et ideo effectus actionis relinquitur in intellectu possibili secundum conditionem utriusque, et non secundum conditionem alterius tantum; et ideo intellectus possibilis recipit formas ut intelligibiles actu, ex virtute intellectus agentis, sed ut similitudines determinatarum rerum ex cognitione phantasmatum. Et sic formae intelligibiles in actu non sunt per se existentes neque in phantasia neque in intellectu agente, sed solum in intellectu possibili. 7. In the reception through which the possible intellect receives species from phantasms, the phantasms act as instrumental and secondary agents. The agent intellect acts as the principal and first agent. Therefore, the effect of the action is received in the possible intellect according to the condition of both, and not according to the condition of either one alone. Therefore, the possible intellect receives forms whose actual intelligibility is due to the power of the agent intellect, but whose determinate likeness to things is due to cognition of the phantasms. These actually intelligible forms do not, of themselves, exist either in the imagination or the agent intellect, but only in the possible intellect. Ad octavum dicendum, quod, quamvis intellectus possibilis sit simpliciter nobilior quam phantasma; tamen secundum quid nihil prohibet phantasma nobilius esse, inquantum scilicet phantasma est actu similitudo talis rei; quod intellectui possibili non convenit nisi in potentia. Et sic, quodammodo potest agere in intellectum possibilem virtute luminis intellectus agentis, sicut et color potest agere in visum virtute luminis corporalis. 8. Although the possible intellect is simply more noble than the phantasm, nothing prevents the phantasm from being more noble n a certain respect, namely, that it is actually the likeness of such a thing, whereas this likeness belongs to the possible intellect only potentially. Thus, in a certain sense, we can say that the phantasm acts on the possible intellect in virtue of the light of the agent intellect, just as color can act on sight in virtue of bodily light. Ad nonum dicendum, quod quies in qua perficitur scientia, excludit motum materialium passionum; non autem motum et passionem communiter accepta, secundum quod quodlibet recipere pati dicitur et moveri; sic enim philosophus dicit in III de anima, quod intelligere quoddam pati est. 9. The rest in which knowledge is achieved eliminates the movement of material passions. It does not eliminate movement and passion in a general sense, inasmuch as all receiving is called passion and movement. In accord with this, the Philosopher says in The Soul: “Intellection is a kind of passion.” ARTICLE VII\n\nIn the seventh article we ask:\n\nIs the image of the trinity in the mind as it knows material things or only as it knows eternal things?\n\n[ARTICLE I Sent., 3, 4, 4; S.T., I, 93, 8] Septimo quaeritur utrum in mente sit imago Trinitatis secundum quod materialia cognoscit, non solum secundum quod cognoscit aeterna Difficulties Et videtur quod non solum secundum quod cognoscit aeterna. It seems that it is not only as the mind knows eternal things, for Quia, ut dicit Augustinus, libro XII de Trinitate, cum quaerimus Trinitatem in anima, in tota quaerimus, non separantes actionem rationalem in temporalibus a contemplatione aeternorum. Sed mens non est ad imaginem nisi secundum quod in ea Trinitas invenitur. Ergo mens est ad imaginem non solum secundum quod inhaeret aeternis contemplandis, sed etiam secundum quod inhaeret temporalibus agendis. 1. As Augustine says: “When we look for the Trinity in our soul, we look for It in the whole soul without separating the activity of reason concerning temporal things from the contemplation of things eternal.” But mind has the character of image only as it has the Trinity in it. Therefore, the mind has the character of image not only in so far as it applies itself to the contemplation of eternal things, but also in so far as it engages in activity concerning temporal things. Praeterea, imago Trinitatis consideratur in anima inquantum in ea repraesentatur aequalitas personarum, et earum origo. Sed magis aequalitas personarum repraesentatur in mente secundum quod cognoscit temporalia, quam secundum quod cognoscit aeterna; cum aeterna in infinitum excedant mentem, mens autem non in infinitum temporalia excedit. Origo etiam personarum repraesentatur in cognitione temporalium, sicut et in cognitione aeternorum, quia utrobique ex mente procedit notitia, et ex notitia procedit amor. Ergo imago Trinitatis non solum est in mente secundum quod cognoscit aeterna, sed etiam secundum quod cognoscit temporalia. 2. We consider the image of the Trinity in the soul in so far as the equality and origin of the persons are represented there. But the equality of the persons is better represented in the mind as knowing things of time than as knowing eternal things, since the latter are infinitely above the mind, whereas the mind is not infinitely above things of time. The origin of the persons, too, is displayed in cognition of things of time as well as in cognition of things eternal, for in both instances knowledge proceeds from the mind and love proceeds from knowledge. Therefore, it has the character of image of the Trinity not only in so far as it knows eternal things, but also in so far as it knows temporal things. Praeterea, similitudo est in potentia diligendi; sed imago in potentia cognoscendi, ut habetur in II sententiarum, XVI distinct. Sed mens nostra per prius cognoscit materialia quam aeterna, cum ex materialibus in aeterna perveniat; et etiam perfectius, cum materialia comprehendat, non autem aeterna. Ergo imago magis est in mente secundum quod comparatur ad temporalia quam secundum quod comparatur ad aeterna. 3. Likeness is in the power of loving, but the image is in the power of knowing, as is said in the Sentences. But our mind knows material things before it knows things eternal, since it goes from material things to eternal things. It also knows material things more perfectly, since it has a comprehensive grasp of temporal things, but not of things eternal. Therefore, the image is in the mind more according to temporal things than according to eternal things. Praeterea, imago Trinitatis invenitur in anima quodammodo secundum potentias, ut supra, dictum est. Sed potentiae indifferenter se habent ad omnia obiecta ad quae potentiae determinantur. Ergo imago Dei invenitur in mente respectu quorumlibet obiectorum. 4. The image of the Trinity in the soul somehow follows its powers, as has been said above. But the powers are related indifferently to all the objects to which they are directed. Therefore, the image of God is in the mind with reference to any of its objects. Praeterea, perfectius videtur illud quod in seipso videtur, quam quod videtur in sui similitudine. Sed anima videt seipsam in se, Deum autem non nisi in similitudine, in statu viae. Ergo perfectius cognoscit seipsam quam Deum. Et ita magis est attendenda imago Trinitatis in anima secundum quod anima cognoscit seipsam, quam secundum quod cognoscit Deum; cum in nobis secundum id imago Trinitatis inveniatur quod perfectissimum in natura nostra habemus, ut Augustinus dicit. 5. Something seen in itself is seen more perfectly than something seen in its likeness. But the soul sees itself in itself; whereas in this life it sees God only in a likeness. Therefore, it knows itself more perfectly than it knows God. So, we should look for the image of the Trinity in the soul rather as it knows itself than as it knows God, since the image of the Trinity is in us according to that which is most perfect in our nature, as Augustine says. Praeterea, secundum hoc personarum aequalitas in mente nostra repraesentatur quod memoria, intelligentia et voluntas tota, invicem se capiunt, ut patet per Augustinum, X de Trinitate. Sed ista mutua comprehensio non ostenderet earum aequalitatem, nisi quantum ad omnia obiecta se comprehenderent. Ergo ratione omnium obiectorum imago Trinitatis invenitur in potentiis mentis. 6. The equality of the persons is represented in our mind in this, that memory, understanding, and the whole will each grasp the others, as is clear from Augustine. But this mutual comprehension shows forth the equality only in so far as they grasp themselves with reference to all objects. Therefore, the image of the Trinity is in the powers of the mind by reason of all their objects. Praeterea, sicut imago est in potentia cognoscendi, ita caritas in potentia diligendi. Sed caritas non solum respicit Deum, sed etiam proximum; unde et duplex ponitur actus caritatis, scilicet dilectio Dei et proximi. Ergo et imago non solum est in mente secundum quod cognoscit Deum, sed etiam secundum quod cognoscit creaturas. 7. As the image is in the power of knowing, so charity is in the power of loving. But charity looks not only to God, but also to the neighbor. Thus, there is a double act of charity: love of God and love of the neighbor. Therefore, the image, also, is in the mind not only as it knows God, but also as it knows creatures. Praeterea, potentiae mentis in quibus consistit imago, aliquibus habitibus perficiuntur, secundum quos imago deformata dicitur reformari et perfici. Sed potentiae mentis non indigent habitibus secundum quod comparantur ad aeterna, sed solum secundum quod comparantur ad temporalia, quia habitus ad hoc sunt ut secundum eos potentiae regulentur; in aeternis autem error non potest accidere, ut ibi regula opus sit, sed solum in temporalibus. Ergo imago magis consistit in mente secundum quod cognoscit temporalia quam secundum quod cognoscit aeterna. 8. The powers of the mind in which the image resides are made perfect by certain habits, according to which the deformed image is said to be re-formed and made perfect. But the powers of the mind do not need habits inasmuch as they are related to things eternal, but only to things temporal. For we have habits in order that powers may be regulated according to them. But there can be no error in things eternal to need regulation, but only in temporal things. Therefore, the image is more in the mind as it knows temporal things than as it knows eternal things. Praeterea, Trinitas increata repraesentatur in imagine mentis nostrae, praecipue quantum ad consubstantialitatem et coaequalitatem. Sed haec duo inveniuntur etiam in potentia sensitiva, quia sensibile et sensus in actu efficiuntur unum, et species sensibilis non recipitur in sensu nisi secundum suam capacitatem. Ergo etiam in potentia sensitiva imago Trinitatis invenitur: multo igitur magis in mente, secundum quod temporalia cognoscit. 9. The uncreated Trinity is represented in the image of the mind especially according to consubstantiality and equality. But these two are also found in the sensitive power, because the sensible thing and sense are made actually one, and the sensible species is received in the senses only according to their capacity. Therefore, the image of the Trinity is in the sensitive power, and so, a fortiori, it is in the mind as it knows temporal things. Praeterea, metaphoricae locutiones secundum aliquas similitudines attenduntur, quia, secundum philosophum, omnes transferentes secundum aliquam similitudinem transferunt. Sed a quibusdam creaturis sensibilibus magis fit transumptio in divina per metaphoricas locutiones, quam etiam ab ipsa mente; sicut patet de radio solari, ut dicit Dionysius, cap. IV de divinis nominibus. Ergo creaturae sensibiles aliquae magis possunt dici ad imaginem quam etiam ipsa mens. Et ita non videtur aliquid impedire quin mens, secundum quod temporalia cognoscit, ad imaginem sit. 10. Metaphorical expressions are accepted according to certain likenesses, for, according to the Philosopher, every term used figuratively is applied according to some likeness. But the application to God through metaphor is taken rather from certain sensible creatures than from the mind itself. This is evidently what Dionysius does when speaking of the rays of the sun. Therefore, some sensible creatures can be said to have the character of image more than the mind. And so, there seems to be nothing to prevent the mind, as knowing temporal things, from having the character of image. Praeterea, Boetius dicit in libro de Trinitate, quod formae quae sunt in materia, sunt imagines illarum rerum quae sunt sine materia. Formae autem in materia existentes sunt formae sensibiles. Ergo formae sensibiles sunt imagines ipsius Dei; et ita mens, secundum quod ea cognoscit, videtur ad imaginem Dei esse. 11. Boethius says that forms which exist in matter are images of those things which exist without matter. But forms existing in matter are sensible forms. Therefore, sensible forms are images of God Himself. Thus, the mind, as knowing them, seems to have the character of image of God. Sed contra. To the Contrary Est quod Augustinus dicit in XV de Trinitate, quod Trinitas quae in inferiori scientia invenitur, licet ad interiorem hominem iam pertineat, nondum tamen imago Dei appellanda est vel putanda. Inferior autem scientia est, secundum quod mens temporalia contemplatur; sic enim a sapientia aeternorum distinguitur. Ergo imago Trinitatis non attenditur in mente secundum quod temporalia cognoscit. 1. Augustine says: “The trinity which is found in a lower science should not be called or be thought to be the image of God, although it doe’s belong to the inner man.” But a lower science is that according to which the mind considers temporal things, and is thus distinguished from wisdom, which refers to eternal things. Therefore, the image of the Trinity is not to be found in the mind according to its knowledge of temporal things. Praeterea, partes imaginis secundum ordinem debent tribus personis respondere. Sed ordo personarum non invenitur in mente secundum quod temporalia cognoscit. In cognitione enim temporalium intelligentia non procedit ex memoria, ut verbum a patre; sed magis memoria ab intelligentia, quia ea quae prius intelleximus, memoramur. Ergo imago non consistit in mente secundum quod temporalia cognoscit. 2. The parts of the image, considered according to their order, should correspond to the three persons. But the order of the persons does not appear in the mind as it knows temporal things. For, in knowing temporal things, understanding does not proceed from memory, as the Word from the Father, but memory rather proceeds from understanding, for we remember those things which we have previously understood. Therefore, the image is not in the mind as it knows things of time. Praeterea, Augustinus dicit, XII de Trinitate: facta ista distributione mentis, quae scilicet dividitur in contemplationem aeternorum, et actionem temporalium, in eo solo quod ad contemplationem pertinet aeternorum, non solum Trinitas, sed etiam imago Dei; in hoc autem quod derivatum est in actione temporalium, etiamsi Trinitas possit, non tamen imago Dei potest inveniri; et sic idem quod prius. 3. Augustine, having given that division of the mind (into contemplation of things eternal and activity concerning temporal things), says: “Not only the Trinity, but also the image of God, exists only in that part which is concerned with contemplation of eternal things. Even if we could find a trinity in that which is derived from activity about things of time, we still would not find the image of God there.” Thus, we conclude as before. Praeterea, imago Trinitatis semper existit in anima, non autem cognitio rerum temporalium, cum per acquisitionem habeatur. Ergo imago Trinitatis non invenitur in anima secundum quod temporalia cognoscit. 4. The image of the Trinity always exists in the soul, but knowledge of temporal things does not, since it is acquired. Therefore, the image of the Trinity is not in the soul as it knows temporal things. Responsio. REPLY Dicendum, quod rationem imaginis similitudo perficit. Non tamen quaelibet similitudo ad rationem imaginis sufficiens invenitur; sed expressissima similitudo, per quam aliquid repraesentatur secundum rationem suae speciei; et ideo in corporalibus imagines rerum attenduntur magis secundum figuras, quae sunt specierum propria signa, quam secundum colores et alia accidentia. Invenitur autem in anima nostra aliqua similitudo Trinitatis increatae secundum quamlibet sui cognitionem, non solum mentis, sed etiam sensus, ut patet per Augustinum XI de Trinit.: sed in illa tantum cognitione mentis imago Dei reperitur, secundum quam in mente nostra expressior Dei similitudo invenitur. Likeness brings the character of image to completion. However, for the character of image not every likeness is sufficient, but the fullest likeness, through which something is represented according to its specific nature. For this reason, in bodies we look for the image more in their shapes, which are the proper marks of species, than in colors and other accidents. There is a likeness of the uncreated Trinity in our soul according to any knowledge which it has of itself, not only of the mind, but also of sense, as Augustine clearly shows.” But we find the image of God only in that knowledge according to which there arises in the mind the fuller likeness of God. Ut igitur cognitionem mentis secundum obiecta distinguamus, triplex cognitio in mente nostra invenitur. Cognitio, scilicet, qua mens cognoscit Deum, et qua cognoscit seipsam, et qua cognoscit temporalia. In illa igitur cognitione qua mens temporalia cognoscit, non invenitur expressa similitudo Trinitatis increatae neque secundum conformationem, quia res materiales magis sunt Deo dissimiles quam ipsa mens, unde per hoc quod mens earum scientia informatur, non efficitur Deo maxime conformis; similiter etiam neque secundum analogiam, eo quod res temporalis, quae sui notitiam parit in anima, vel intelligentiam actualem, non est eiusdem substantiae cum ipsa mente, sed extraneum a natura eius; et sic non potest per hoc increatae Trinitatis consubstantialitas repraesentari. Therefore, if we distinguish the knowledge of the mind according to objects, we find in our mind a threefold knowledge. There is the knowledge by which the mind knows God, by which it knows itself, and by which it knows temporal things. In the knowledge by which the mind knows temporal things there is no expressed likeness of the uncreated Trinity, either according to adaptation or according to analogy. It is not according to the first, because material things are more unlike God than is the mind itself. Thus, the mind does not become fully conformed to God for being informed by knowledge of these material things. Nor yet is it according to analogy, for a temporal thing, which begets knowledge, or even actual understanding of itself in the soul, is not of the same substance as the mind, but something extraneous to its nature. Thus, the consubstantiality of the uncreated Trinity cannot be represented through it. Sed in cognitione qua mens nostra cognoscit seipsam, est repraesentatio Trinitatis increatae secundum analogiam, inquantum hoc modo mens cognoscens seipsam verbum sui gignit, et ex utroque procedit amor. Sicut pater seipsum dicens, verbum suum genuit ab aeterno, et ex utroque spiritus sanctus procedit. Sed in cognitione illa qua mens ipsum Deum cognoscit mens ipsa Deo conformatur, sicut omne cognoscens, inquantum huiusmodi, assimilatur cognito. But in the knowledge by which our mind knows itself there is a representation of the uncreated Trinity according to analogy. It lies in this, that the mind, knowing itself in this way, begets a word expressing itself, and love proceeds from both of these, just as the Father, uttering Himself, has begotten the Word from eternity, and the Holy Spirit proceeds from both. But in that cognition by which the mind knows God the mind itself becomes conformed to God, just as every knower, as such, is assimilated to that which is known. Maior est autem similitudo quae est per conformitatem, ut visus ad colorem, quam quae est per analogiam, ut visus ad intellectum, qui similiter ad sua obiecta comparatur. Unde expressior similitudo Trinitatis est in mente secundum quod cognoscit Deum, quam secundum quod cognoscit seipsam. Et ideo proprie imago Trinitatis in mente est secundum quod cognoscit Deum primo et principaliter: sed quodam modo et secundario etiam secundum quod cognoscit seipsam et praecipue prout seipsam considerat ut est imago Dei; ut sic eius consideratio non sistat in se, sed procedat usque ad Deum. In consideratione vero rerum temporalium non invenitur imago, sed similitudo quaedam Trinitatis, quae magis potest ad vestigium pertinere, sicut et similitudo quam Augustinus assignat in potentiis sensitivis. But there is a greater likeness through conformity, as of sight to color, than through analogy, as of sight to understanding, which is related to its objects in a way similar to that of sight. Consequently, the likeness of the Trinity is clearer in mind, as knowing God, than as knowing itself. Therefore, properly speaking, the image of the Trinity is in the mind primarily and mainly, in so far as the mind knows God, and it is there in a certain manner and secondarily, in so far as the mind knows itself, especially when it considers itself in so far as it is the image of God. As a result, its consideration does not stop with itself, but goes on to God. There is no image in the consideration of temporal things, but a kind of likeness of the Trinity, which can partake more of the character of vestige. Such is the likeness which Augustine attributes to the sensitive powers. Answers to Difficulties Ad primum igitur dicendum, quod Trinitas quidem aliqua invenitur in mente, secundum quod se extendit ad actionem temporalium; sed tamen illa Trinitas non dicitur imago increatae Trinitatis, ut patet per ea quae ibidem Augustinus subiungit. 1. There is indeed a trinity in the mind, as it applies itself to activity concerned with temporal things. But this trinity is not called the image of the uncreated Trinity, as is clear from what Augustine adds to that passage. Ad secundum dicendum, quod aequalitas divinarum personarum magis repraesentatur in cognitione aeternorum quam temporalium. Non enim est attendenda aequalitas inter obiectum et potentiam, sed inter unam potentiam et aliam. Quamvis autem maior sit inaequalitas inter mentem nostram et Deum, quam inter mentem nostram et rem temporalem; tamen inter memoriam quam mens nostra habet de Deo, et actualem intelligentiam eius et amorem, maior invenitur aequalitas quam inter memoriam quam habet de rebus temporalibus, et earum intelligentiam et amorem. Ipse enim Deus per seipsum cognoscibilis est et diligibilis, et ita tantum a mente uniuscuiusque intelligitur et amatur, quantum menti praesens est; cuius praesentia in mente ipsius memoria in mente est et sic memoriae, quae de ipso habetur, intelligentia et huic voluntas sive amor adaequatur. 2. The equality of the divine persons is better represented in the knowledge of eternal than of temporal things. For we should not look for equality between object and power, but between one power and another. Moreover, although there is greater inequality between our mind and God than between our mind and a temporal thing, yet between the memory which our mind has of God and actual understanding and love of God there is greater equality than between the memory it has of temporal things and the understanding and love of them. For God is knowable and lovable of Himself and is understood and loved by the mind of each to the degree in which He is present to the mind. His presence in the mind is memory of Him in the mind; thus, intelligence is proportioned to the memory of Him, and will or love is proportioned to this intelligence. Res autem materiales non sunt secundum se intelligibiles et diligibiles. Et ideo respectu earum talis aequalitas in mente non invenitur, nec etiam idem ordo originis cum ex hoc nostrae memoriae praesentes sint, quod a nobis intellectae fuerunt; et sic memoria ex intelligentia oritur potius quam e converso; cuius contrarium in mente creata accidit respectu ipsius Dei, ex cuius praesentia mens intellectuale participat lumen, ut intelligere possit. However, physical things as such are not intelligible or lovable and so there is not this equality in the mind with reference to them. Neither is there the same order of origin, since these are present to our memory because we have understood them, and so memory arises from understanding rather than conversely. The opposite of this takes place in the created mind with reference to God from whose presence the mind participates in intellectual light so that it can understand. Ad tertium dicendum, quod quamvis cognitio quam de rebus materialibus habemus, sit prior tempore illa notitia quam habemus de Deo, tamen haec est prior dignitate. Nec obstat quod materialia a nobis perfectius cognoscuntur quam Deus; quia minima cognitio quae de Deo haberi potest, superat omnem cognitionem quae de creatura habetur. Nobilitas enim scientiae ex nobilitate sciti dependet, ut patet in principio I de anima; unde et in XI de animalibus philosophus praeponit modicam scientiam quam habemus de rebus caelestibus omni scientiae quam de rebus inferioribus habemus. 3. Although the knowledge which we have of physical things is prior in time to that which we have of God, the latter is prior in dignity. And the fact that we know physical reality better than we know God offers no difficulty, because the least knowledge which can be had about God surpasses all knowledge about creatures. The nobility of knowledge depends on the nobility of the thing known, as is clear from The Soul. For this reason, the Philosopher puts the little knowledge which we have of heavenly things before all the knowledge which we have about things here below. Ad quartum dicendum, quod quamvis potentiae se extendant ad omnia sua obiecta, tamen earum virtus pensatur ex ultimo in quod possunt, ut patet in I caeli et mundi. Et ideo id quod ad maximam perfectionem potentiarum mentis pertinet, scilicet esse ad imaginem Dei, attribuitur eis respectu nobilissimi obiecti, quod Deus est. 4. Although powers extend to all their objects, their capacity is measured by the highest thing which they can reach, as appears in Heaven and Earth. Therefore, that which belongs to the highest perfection of the powers of the mind, namely, to be in the image of God, is attributed to them with reference to the most noble object, which is God. Ad quintum dicendum, quod quamvis mens perfectius seipsam cognoscat quam Deum, tamen cognitio quam habet de Deo, est nobilior, et per eam magis Deo conformatur, ut dictum est; et ideo secundum ipsam magis est ad Dei imaginem. 5. Although the mind knows itself more perfectly than it knows God, the knowledge which it has of God is more noble, and through it the mind becomes more conformed to God, as has been said. Therefore, it is rather according to this that the mind is in the image of God. Ad sextum dicendum quod quamvis aequalitas ad imaginem pertineat, quae in mente nostra invenitur, non tamen oportet quod respectu omnium imago attendatur; respectu quorum aliqua aequalitas invenitur in ipsa, eo quod plura alia ad imaginem requiruntur; unde ratio non sequitur. 6. Although the equality belongs to the image which is in our mind, it is not necessary to consider the image with respect to everything, with reference to which some equality is found in it, since many other things are needed for an image. Hence, the argument does not follow. Ad septimum dicendum, quod quamvis caritas, quae imaginem perficit, respiciat proximum, non tamen sicut principale obiectum, cum eius principale obiectum sit solus Deus; in proximo enim nihil diligit caritas nisi Deum. 7. Although charity, which brings the image to completion, looks to the neighbor, it does not do so as to its principal object, since only God is its principal object. For charity loves nothing in one’s neighbor except God. Ad octavum dicendum, quod potentiae imaginis aliquibus habitibus perficiuntur etiam secundum quod comparantur in Deum, sicut fide, spe et caritate, sapientia, et aliis huiusmodi. Quamvis enim in ipsis aeternis error non inveniatur ex parte ipsorum, potest tamen accidere error nostro intellectui in cognitione eorum; difficultas enim in eis cognoscendis accidit non ex eis, sed ex parte nostra, ut dicitur II Metaphysic. 8. The powers of the image, even in so far as they are related to God, are made perfect through certain habits, as faith, hope, charity, wisdom, and others like these. For, although in these eternal things there is no error on their part, there still can be error on the part of our understanding in its knowledge of these. The difficulty in knowing them comes not from them, but from us, as is said in the Metaphysics.” Ad nonum dicendum, quod inter sensibile et sensum non invenitur consubstantialitas, eo quod ipsum sensibile est extraneum a sensus essentia; nec etiam invenitur aequalitas, cum quandoque non semper tantum videatur visibile, quantum visibile est. 9. There is no identity of substance between sense and the sensible thing, because the sensible thing is outside the essence of the senses. Nor is there equality, for sometimes the visible thing is not always seen to the full extent of its visibility. Ad decimum dicendum, quod creaturae aliquae irrationales possunt quadam similitudine magis Deo assimilari quam etiam rationales, quantum ad causandi efficaciam: sicut patet de radio solari, quo omnia in inferioribus causantur et renovantur; et ex hoc convenit cum divina bonitate, quae omnia causat, ut dicit Dionysius. Tamen secundum proprietates sibi inhaerentes magis creatura rationalis Deo est similis quam quaecumque irrationalis. 10. With reference to the effectiveness of their causality, certain irrational creatures can in some way become more like God than even rational creatures. This appears in the sun’s rays, by which everything in lower bodies is caused and renewed. In this way, it is like the divine goodness which causes all things, as Dionysius says. Still, according to properties inhering in it, the rational creature is more like God than any irrational creature. Hoc tamen quod a creaturis irrationalibus frequentius metaphoricae locutiones transferuntur in Deum, contingit ex ratione dissimilitudinis; quia, ut Dionysius dicit, cap. II caelestis hierarchiae, ea quae sunt in vilioribus creaturis, ideo frequentius transferuntur in divina, ut omnis errandi tollatur occasio. Translatio enim a creaturis nobilioribus facta aestimationem posset inducere, quod ea quae metaphorice dicerentur essent secundum proprietatem intelligenda; quod opinari nullus potest de ipsis vilioribus creaturis. That metaphorical expressions are more frequently taken from irrational creatures and applied to God is due to their dissimilarity. This is done because, as Dionysius says, what belongs to less noble creatures is more frequently transferred to God to remove all occasion for error. For the transfer made from noble creatures could bring about the belief that those things which are applied metaphorically were to be understood properly. No one can think this about less noble things. Ad undecimum dicendum, quod Boetius formae materiales ponit esse imagines non Dei, sed formarum immaterialium, id est rationum idealium in mente divina existentium, a quibus secundum perfectam similitudinem oriuntur. 11. Boethius makes material forms images, not of God, but of immaterial forms, that is, of the ideal natures existing in the divine mind, from which material forms arise with a perfect likeness. ARTICLE VIII\n\nIn the eighth article we ask:\n\nDoes the mind know itself through its essence or through some species?\n\n[ARTICLE De ver., 8, 6; S.T., II, 75; III, 46; S.T., I, 14, 2, ad 3; 87, 1; Q.D. de anima, 16, ad 8; II De anima, 6, nn. 304-308; III de anima, 9, nn. 721, 724-726.] Octavo quaeritur utrum mens seipsam per essentiam cognoscat, aut per aliquam speciem Difficulties Et videtur quod per aliquam speciem. It seems that it knows itself through some species, for Quia, ut philosophus dicit in III de anima, intellectus noster nihil intelligit sine phantasmate. Sed ipsius essentiae animae non potest accipi aliquod phantasma. Ergo oportet quod per aliquam aliam speciem a phantasmatibus abstractam mens nostra seipsam intelligat. 1. As the Philosopher says: “Our intellect understands nothing without a phantasm.” But it cannot receive a phantasm of the very essence of the soul. Therefore, our mind must understand itself through some other species abstracted from phantasms. Praeterea, ea quae per sui essentiam videntur, certissime cognoscuntur sine errore. Sed de mente humana multi erraverunt: cum quidam dicerent eam esse aerem quidam ignem, et multa alia de ea inepta sentirent. Ergo mens non videt se per essentiam suam. 2. Those things which are seen through their essence are most certainly apprehended without error. But many err about the human mind, for some say it is air, others fire, and hold many other foolish opinions about it. Therefore, the mind does not see itself through its essence. Sed dicebat, quod mens per essentiam suam videt se esse; errare tamen potest in inquirendo quid sit. —Sed contra, scire aliquid per essentiam suam, est scire de eo quid est, cum essentia rei sit idem quod q"
