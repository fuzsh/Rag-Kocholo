No wonder choral music—of one sort or another—can be traced far back in history and found just about anywhere. Its strongest and most prolific source, however, is in Western civilization and Christianity, starting with the Gregorian reforms of the 6th century. Developing most notably in Europe and North America, it became an increasingly important medium for intercultural exchange during the 20th century, and choruses are now springing up throughout the world. More remarkably, while the canons still prevail in many quarters, current styles are increasingly varied and experimental, presented in a growing array of languages (and occasionally no language at all). Clearly, choral music is now more widespread than ever before, providing pleasure to the larger public than could ever have been imagined. This Historical Dictionary of Choral Music focuses mostly on familiar figures like Bach, Beethoven, Brahms, and Britten. But its scope is considerably broader, for it covers all periods of Western music: medieval, classical, romantic, and modern. It includes all sorts of music—religious, secular, and popular—from sources throughout the world, even if it is focused more heavily on those in Europe and America. And it presents an incredible roster of composers, some well recognized but others barely known (at least for their choral works) or simply forgotten, as well as technical choral information and terminology. The dictionary itself includes more than one thousand entries. The choral art’s long pedigree is traced in a chronology, and an introduction puts it in perspective. Finally, a comprehensive bibliography allows for further reading, directing readers to other works, whether general or specialized, to various forms of choral music, and to the individuals who have composed or practiced it. ix\n\nx •\n\nEDITOR’S FOREWORD\n\nThis volume in Scarecrow’s series on literature and the arts was written by Melvin P. Unger, who comes to the topic from several perspectives: as a practitioner, who conducts the B-W Singers at the BaldwinWallace College Conservatory of Music (Berea, Ohio) and the Singers’ Club of Cleveland; as a teacher who holds the Riemenschneider Chair in Music at the B-W Conservatory; as a scholar and researcher, directing the Riemenschneider Bach Institute; and finally as an author on the topic—four books in all, with a particular focus on Johann Sebastian Bach. Although this historical dictionary will certainly not be read in one sitting, it should be both of value to anyone interested in choral music and a necessary reference to choral-music students and researchers. Jon Woronoff Series Editor\n\nPreface\n\nThis Historical Dictionary of Choral Music provides, in one volume, basic information about the most important composers, genres, conductors, institutions, styles, and technical terms of choral music. It also provides an extensive bibliography. Where sources diverge on matters of fact, I have whenever possible followed the second edition of The New Grove Dictionary of Music and Musicians. While intended for musicians at all levels, it is aimed particularly at those who seek factual information about composers and their choral works, the development of genres, or historical choral practice. It is restricted in scope almost entirely to choral music of the Western world. Inevitably, it reflects my own choral experiences and education. For this reason, readers will discern a distinct North American slant. About two-thirds of the entries deal with composers and their works. The remainder covers the following categories (ranked here according to frequency of appearance): technical terms (including compositional styles); genres; conductors; choirs; institutions and organizations; other individuals; collections; and individual works. In lists of composers’ works, performance forces are sometimes not specified for the sake of economy. This applies particularly to works for unaccompanied mixed chorus, whose scoring (almost always SATB) is implied by the omission. Where vocal scoring is provided, soloists are distinguished from choral forces by the use of commas (S, A, T, B = soloists; SATB = choir). The dates given for individual works are usually dates of completion and/or publication rather than dates of composition. One of the most difficult tasks in compiling a comprehensive book of this type is deciding what to include and what to omit. In making these judgments, the most important consideration is the apparent significance of each potential entry for the development and propagation of choral music. In some instances, composers who wrote little choral xi\n\nxii •\n\nPREFACE\n\nmusic have been included because they exerted considerable influence on others who did. In other cases, composers relatively unknown today have been retained because of their considerable output. Most major choral works do not receive independent treatment. Instead, they are covered in the composer entries (an exception being compilations). Technical terms possibly outside a layperson’s vocabulary are included. Major genres are dealt with at considerable length. To keep the book within manageable limits, operatic and other dramatic vocal literature have generally not been addressed. For this reason, opera choral ensembles and their directors have also been omitted. Readers who are interested in further information on this repertoire may consult the guide published David P. DeVenney, David and Craig R. Johnson (see bibliography). Objective facts—names, dates, places, definitions, numbers and types of compositions, and the like—make up most of the information. Although aesthetic judgments can be inferred from the inclusion or exclusion of a particular person, institution, or genre (as well as from the amount of detail included), they are generally not included within the entries themselves. For composers with prodigious oeuvres, the disposition across genres is given; in other instances, representative works are listed. (As a result of this approach, the length of composers’ entries are not necessarily proportionate to the size of their oeuvres.) To provide the philosophical, sociological, and/or religious context for composers’ works, some biographical details not immediately related to their choral activities have been included. For similar reasons, significant historical developments (such as the establishment and growth of the English cathedral choral tradition), are treated at some length. For composers whose countries use the Julian rather than the Gregorian calendar, birth and death dates are given according to both systems (the Julian date appearing first). Within the dictionary, section items that appear in bold within the text have an individual entry. Other cross-referencing is shown by See and See also.\n\nAcknowledgments\n\nBaldwin-Wallace College provided generous support for this book, for which I am grateful. In particular, I wish to express my thanks for the assistance of institutionally funded student researchers, Samantha Inman, Carmen DiTurno, and Rory O’Connor, who helped gather massive amounts of material. I also thank all those individuals who kindly responded to my requests for personal information so that the book could achieve a certain degree of consistency.\n\nxiii\n\nAcronyms and Abbreviations\n\nA a. acc. accdn.

This desire apparently stems from a deeply rooted human instinct. Consequently, choral performance historically has often been related to human rituals and ceremonies, especially rites of a religious nature.\n\nTERMINOLOGY The term choir is often used synonymously with chorus: both designate ensembles performing vocal music (with or without instrumental accompaniment), often in parts, with more than one singer performing each vocal part. Most choirs sing under the direction of a conductor or choirmaster. By extension, the term chorus is also applied to a choral movement in a larger work. Sometimes a distinction is made between the two terms, with choir being restricted to ensembles performing sacred music in church settings, and chorus being reserved for ensembles performing in secular settings. Qualifying terms are often added to signify a choir’s constitution, repertoire, function, or institutional affiliation. Accordingly, an ensemble may be referred to as a mixed choir (i.e., with male and female voices, and often designated SATB—for soprano, alto, tenor, and bass voices), male choir (often designated TTBB), women’s choir or treble choir (often designated SSA), children’s choir, symphonic choir, madrigal choir, chamber choir, vocal jazz choir, show choir (in which members dance while singing), barbershop choir, church choir, cathedral choir, school choir, college choir, glee club, community choir, schola cantorum, amateur choir, or professional choir. When is a vocal ensemble not a choir? It is important to note that vocal ensemble music does not always constitute choral music, strictly speaking. Much of the so-called standard choral repertoire was originally intended 1\n\n2 •\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nfor one singer per part. Examples include much of the secular music in the Medieval and Renaissance eras (including, for example, most chansons and madrigals). After 1660, too, when solo singing was viewed as the ideal medium for rhetorically effective delivery of a text, concerted ensemble music was often intended for soloists. According to scholars such as Joshua Rifkin, even the church cantatas of Johann Sebastian Bach and his contemporaries were performed “one on a part.” Because such sacred repertoire has long been regarded as the province of church music directors, the arguments regarding Bach’s performance forces and how he used them have become the subject of long and fierce debates. It is of course possible (and often very effective) to render music originally intended for an ensemble of vocal soloists with choral forces, provided that textural clarity and textual intelligibility can be reasonably maintained. Nevertheless, to alert the reader to the possible distinction between this type of performance, this dictionary sometimes (self-consciously) employs the term vocal ensemble music rather than choral works.\n\nTHE HISTORY OF CHORAL SINGING For hundreds of years, the history of Western choral music largely paralleled the development of singing in the Western Christian church. Throughout the Medieval and Renaissance eras, sacred vocal music was performed in churches and monasteries by male voices. Later exceptions (where women were allowed to participate) included convents and the churches attached to Venetian ospedali—four charitable institutions founded for the musical training of orphaned or abandoned young girls. Choirs were small by modern standards: in the late Medieval era, cathedral choirs usually numbered under 20 singers. Even after polyphony was invented (toward the end of the first millennium) choirs initially performed only monophonic music; polyphony was the province of soloists. Secular polyphonic music, too, was performed by mostly amateur male or female solo singers (with instruments doubling the voices or substituting for them), who performed for convivial entertainment in the homes of aristocrats or wealthy commoners. For festive occasions at court, however, choruses of professional singers might perform.\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\n• 3\n\nEvidence suggests that around 1430 sacred polyphony began to be presented by multiple singers on each part. By the end of the century a standardized four-part range of three octaves or more had been established, the associated vocal parts eventually called superius (later, soprano), altus, tenor (from its function of “holding” the cantus-firmus), and bassus. This standard four-part vocal scoring did not preclude compositions for either fewer or more voices, however. During the Renaissance, works for grand occasions often included many vocal parts; these were usually divided into sub-choirs (as in the case of a famous motet by Thomas Tallis, Spem in alium, whose 40 voices are divided into eight choirs of five parts each). Soprano parts continued to be sung by boys; alto parts were sung by boys and/or by men with an unusually high vocal range or a proficiency at singing in falsetto. In the later 1500s castrati began appearing in Catholic church choirs (especially in Italy). Despite official church opposition to the practice of castration, castrati continued to sing in church choirs well into the 19th century. Meanwhile, secular music (madrigals, chansons, and the like) was being written for social occasions—often at the courts of the nobility. Church and chapel choir size increased during the Renaissance era; by the early 17th century, choirs of important establishments such as King’s College (Cambridge), Magdalen College (Oxford), and the Papal Choir stood at 32. On the other hand, a few court chapels had large musical establishments—for example, the Bavarian court chapel during the time of Orlande de Lassus boasted a choir roster of more than 60 singers and half that many instrumentalists. In the wake of the Reformation some Protestant groups (such as the followers of John Calvin) discouraged choral music. Others— Lutherans and Anglicans in particular—continued to cultivate it, more or less following Catholic choir models (though stressing the vernacular over Latin). Female singers were still excluded. While Lutherans stressed the didactic role of choral performance in the service, Anglicans (with the exception of some counter movements) tended to value and conserve Catholic musical traditions for their aesthetic value. Choirs in Anglican churches were divided into two parts and seated according to the “split chancel” model: the decani seated on the south side (on the congregation’s right, near the dean), and the cantoris seated on the north side (on the congregation’s left,\n\n4 •\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nnear the cantor). This arrangement favored antiphonal and responsorial performance, and encouraged the development of the English verse anthem. During the Baroque era, ecclesiastical choirs stayed about the same in size; in some cases (such as in German cities during the Thirty Years’ War) they were actually smaller. Polychoral and concertante writing, cultivated especially at San Marco (St. Mark’s Basilica) in Venice, became popular throughout Europe. In France, the grand motet exploited the contrast between a group of solo voices (petit choeur) and the full choir (grand choeur). Choirs also played a role in early Baroque Italian operas (e.g., in the works of Claudio Monteverdi), in some later French and English theatrical works, and especially in Baroque oratorios, where the chorus reached its greatest structural and dramatic significance in the oratorios of George Frideric Handel, despite a relatively modest size of some 25 singers. After Handel’s death oratorio festivals honoring the composer emerged in England, with hundreds of singers participating. These festivals stimulated the establishment of singing societies, and of amateur choral singing in general—not only in England but in the rest of Europe. Under the influence of Enlightenment ideas, civic choral music-making became an important aspect of the social fabric in many European countries, often taking on a patriotic cast (especially in male choir organizations). Choral singing was thus liberated from its earlier ecclesiastical ties. On the other hand, the popularity of choral festivals fostered the creation of large-scale choral works intended for concert performance. After Ludwig van Beethoven’s Choral Symphony, other composers followed suit in employing choirs in their symphonic works. The chorus became increasingly important in Romantic opera, too, and some of the choral movements from 19th-century operas have found their place in the standard choral concert repertoire. While most sacred choral works composed during the Classical era were kept within the reach of the relatively small choirs in churches and court chapels, compositions during the Romantic era tended toward the grandiose as composers exercised their growing artistic autonomy. These concert-oriented works (e.g., Beethoven’s Missa Solemnis, Anton Bruckner’s masses, and the requiem settings of Hector Berlioz and\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\n• 5\n\nGiuseppe Verdi, among others), in turn gave rise to reactionary movements such as the Cecilian movement, which aimed at restoring unaccompanied polyphony to the Catholic liturgy. In Protestant churches (both in Europe and North America), a desire to improve the state of choral singing led to systematic efforts to train singers—in colonial America this included itinerant music teachers (such as William Billings) who offered singing schools. About this time, too, women began appearing in church choirs. American veneration of European musical models led to the importing of Anglican anthems, the adoption of English and German music styles, and the formation of singing societies honoring the legacy of English and German composers (one of the earliest being Boston’s Handel and Haydn Society, founded 1815). Large choral festivals following European models were organized. After the emancipation of slaves in the United States, singing in black churches flourished and, with the help of touring ensembles such as the Jubilee Singers, the black spiritual entered the choral repertory. As music entered the curricula in systems of universal education, the role of schools and colleges in choral music education became increasingly important. Mixed choruses became the organizational standard at most institutions (even while the male glee club tradition continued, supplemented by women’s glee clubs). Increased emphasis on choral techniques (especially in unaccompanied singing) raised the artistic standard of performances. Influential choral conductors in North America included F. Melius Christiansen, John Finley Williamson, Fred Waring, Robert Shaw, and Roger Wagner. Their emphasis on a refined technique, which addressed vocal balance, tonal blend, clear diction, and tonal and rhythmic precision, was admired and emulated by many other conductors. More significantly, these techniques and a canon of choral literature were disseminated in advanced degree programs in American universities (ultimately leading to the Doctor of Musical Arts [DMA] degree in choral conducting) and through the activities of choral organizations such as the American Choral Directors Association (ACDA) and similar groups in other countries, many of whom joined together to form the International Federation for Choral Music (IFCM). Individually and collectively these organizations sponsored choral conferences, symposia, workshops, festivals, journals, and (more recently) online resources.\n\n6 •\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nToward the end of the century, a growing interest in the sounds of other cultures led conductors to modify the ideal of a uniform tone and refined technique. Hand in hand with the exploration of native and non-Western music (and reproducing it authentically) went the ongoing pursuit of historically informed choral practice. While large-scale performances of Baroque and Classical works continued to be popular, interest in chamber-size performances (in keeping with the smaller scale of original performances) increased, with a concomitant emphasis on lighter and clearer tone production. On the other end of the spectrum were choral pieces of the avant garde, which often required extended vocal techniques. Choral singers were now expected to be more versatile, able to produce the varied types of tone production and diction required by a heterogeneous repertoire. Under the influence of visually dominated media, choirs increasingly began to incorporate visual elements into their performances as well. To some extent these challenges were met by the establishment of specialized choirs: madrigal (or chamber) ensembles, gospel choirs, show choirs, etc. One other notable development in the later 20th century was the founding of many gay and lesbian choirs in the United States and Europe, now organized internationally as The Gay and Lesbian Association of Choruses (GALA). While amateur choral singing had always been motivated in part by its social dimension and sometimes by a shared belief system or cause, the extent and cultural impact of this fastgrowing phenomenon was historically unprecedented. A more modest development in the 20th century was the growth of professional choruses to meet the rising artistic expectations created by touring choirs and the recording industry. While European choral ensembles were often state supported, choirs in North America had to be much more enterprising in raising their support. To help provide artistic as well as organizational resources for these ensembles Chorus America was formed. All of these developments encouraged the exchange of information among choirs, a certain competitiveness among ensembles, and an awareness of the artistic levels to which both amateurs and professionals could strive.\n\nThe Dictionary\n\n–A– ABENDMUSIK [GER. “EVENING MUSIC”]. A late afternoon or evening concert in the Marienkirche of Lübeck made famous by Dietrich Buxtehude after he became organist there in 1668. Apparently begun as organ recitals by his predecessor, Franz Tunder, Abendmusiken continued until 1810. Buxtehude’s more ambitious concerts included sacred concertos and oratorios, whose larger choral and orchestral forces necessitated the construction in 1669 of four extra balconies capable of holding 40 performers. Buxtehude also changed the time of the performances from a weekday to 4:00 p.m. on the six Sundays before Christmas (with a pause for the first Sunday of Advent, resulting in a total of five concerts). For most of their history these concerts were free, though donors received a printed libretto and a choice seat. A CAPPELLA [IT. “IN THE STYLE OF THE CHAPEL”]. Choral music (sacred or secular) sung without accompanying instruments. At the beginning of the Baroque era (about 1600), the term was used to distinguish the older contrapuntal style of composers from the concertato style then being developed. During the 19th century, when Roman Catholic church musicians idealized Renaissance polyphony (and the works of Giovanni Pierluigi da Palestrina in particular), they encountered the term in historical sources. Not realizing that instruments had often been used to double or replace vocal parts during the Renaissance and finding no instrumental parts included in the sources, they interpreted the term to mean unaccompanied vocal singing. This meaning has been retained to the present day.\n\n7\n\n8 •\n\nADLER, SAMUEL\n\nADLER, SAMUEL (4 MARCH 1928– ). American composer and conductor. Born in Germany to a Jewish cantor/composer, he emigrated to the United States in 1939 with his parents. He was educated at Boston and Harvard universities, where his teachers included Aaron Copland, Paul Hindemith, Randall Thompson, and Archibald Davison. He also studied conducting with Serge Koussevitzky at the Berkshire Music Center. After successful service in the U.S. Army as an orchestra conductor, he worked for a while as a conductor and lecturer before receiving an appointment in 1957 as professor of composition at North Texas State University. From 1954 until 1958 he was music director of the Dallas Lyric Theater and the Dallas Chorale. He taught at Eastman School of Music from 1966 until his retirement in 1995, serving as chair of the composition department for the last two decades of his tenure. He subsequently taught at Juilliard. Adler’s hundreds of compositions (of which more than 200 have been published) cover a wide range of styles (including diatonic and pandiatonic harmonies, serialism, and avant-garde techniques) and often reflect a penchant for counterpoint and rhythmic vitality. Many of his choral works employ sacred texts. Among them are several Sabbath services and other larger-scale pieces, including The Vision of Isaiah, for brass, mixed chorus, and orch. (1962); From out of Bondage, for S, A, T, B, mixed chorus, brass qnt., perc., and org. (1968); We Believe, for mixed chorus and 8 insts. (1974); A Falling of Saints, for 2 male vv., chorus, and orch. (1977); Choose Life, an oratorio for Mez., T, SATB, and orch. (1986); and Ever Since Babylon, for 4 solo vv., SATB, and 8 instr. (1991). He also wrote a large body of liturgical pieces and many secular partsongs. AGAZZARI, AGOSTINO (C. 1580–JANUARY 1642). Italian composer and theorist. As a church musician working primarily in Sienna and Rome, Agazzari composed music in a generally conservative, lateRenaissance style, but he also acknowledged newer trends with concertato writing in sectionalized forms and an overall text-dominated orientation to composition. His treatise on the thoroughbass is an important document for understanding performance practice of the time. Agazzari’s compositions are mainly sacred and include one volume of masses, three volumes of psalm settings, seven settings of the Litany of Loreto, devotional madrigals, and many volumes of motets (with continuo), all of which were disseminated widely.\n\nALBRIGHT, WILLIAM\n\n• 9\n\nAGOSTINI, PAOLO (C. 1583–3 OCTOBER 1629). Italian organist and composer of sacred music. His surviving compositions include many masses, which are striking for their contrapuntal artistry, especially their complex canonic writing. Also extant are some motets and psalm settings, which demonstrate his familiarity with concertato style. AGRICOLA, ALEXANDER (?1445/46–15 AUGUST 1506). FrancoFlemish composer who worked in Italy, France, and the Low Countries and who was famous for his works in all contemporary genres—but especially for his secular pieces. Though few of his works can be dated exactly, he appears to have taken Jean de Ockeghem’s long-breathed, nonimitative style as a point of departure. He also used pervasive imitation, which became popular during the time of Josquin des Prez. To these general compositional trends he added a distinctively eccentric, extravagant restlessness that was both praised and criticized. His extant vocal works often make use of borrowed material and include 8 masses, 4 Credo movements, other liturgical music including Lamentation and Magnificat settings, 18 motets, and about 50 secular works (most for three voices, often in formes fixes). ALBERTI, GASPARO (C. 1489–C. 1560). Italian composer who spent his career at the basilica of Santa Maria Maggiore in Bergamo. He copied choirbooks and wrote liturgical music, including masses, motets, Magnificats, Passions, and Lamentations. His style incorporates imitative and nonimitative polyphony, falsobordone, and cantus firmus; and he was one of the first composers to use polychoral technique. ALBRECHTSBERGER, JOHANN GEORG (3 FEBRUARY 1736– 7 MARCH 1809). Prolific Austrian composer, organist, and teacher. From 1793 he served as Kapellmeister at St. Stephen’s Cathedral in Vienna. He championed polyphonic writing and, as one of the most sought-after teachers of his day, he influenced many composers, including Joseph Haydn and Ludwig van Beethoven. Extant choral works include 6 oratorios, 35 masses, and a great deal of other liturgical music. ALBRIGHT, WILLIAM (20 OCTOBER 1944–17 SEPTEMBER 1998). American composer, organist, and pianist. After studies at various American institutions he went to Paris to study composition\n\n10 •\n\nALFVÉN, HUGO\n\nwith Olivier Messiaen. From 1970 until his death in 1998, he taught at the University of Michigan. His music is characterized by a wideranging eclecticism that includes references to American popular music (e.g., ragtime). Among his choral works are two masses (including Chichester Mass, commissioned for the 900th anniversary of Chichester Cathedral in 1974); some psalm settings (1982), an oratorio, A Song to David (C. Smart), for solo vv., 2 choruses, and org. (1983); Take Up the Song (Edna St. Vincent Millay), for S, SATB, and pf. (1986); Antigone’s Reply (Sophocles), for S, Bar., SATB, and pf. (1987); Deum de Deo, for SATB and org./pf. (1988); Dona nobis pacem, for SATB and pf. (1992); and hymn settings. ALFVÉN, HUGO (1 MAY 1872–8 MAY 1960). Swedish composer, conductor, and violinist. From 1904 he led various choirs, including the Orphei Drängar (1910–47), which toured extensively in Europe. From 1910 to 1939 he also served as the music director of Uppsala University. His choral compositions include about 60 works to Swedish texts, among them, larger works with orchestra. About two-thirds of his pieces are for male voices; some of these are also scored for mixed voices. His arrangements of folksongs became very popular. He himself regarded Herrans bön [The Lord’s Prayer], an oratorio characterized by lush harmonies and complex contrapuntal writing, as one of his most significant works. ALLEGRI, GREGORIO (1582–7 February 1652). Italian singer and composer active in Rome. His works continue the a cappella contrapuntal style of Giovanni Pierluigi da Palestrina and were very popular in Rome, being recopied many times. His most famous work, Miserere (Psalm 1), was performed annually by the papal choir for two centuries—but in versions altered by others, therefore owing little to Allegri’s original. His other extant compositions are mostly for unaccompanied double choir; they include four masses (for five to eight voices) and motets. ALTERNATIM. A historical style of liturgical performance in which alternate passages of a text are rendered by contrasting forces, especially in the singing of psalms and canticles. Often a soloist singing chant alternates with a choir singing polyphony. Other options include the alternation of choir and organ.\n\nANDRIESSEN, HENDRIK\n\n• 11\n\nAMERICAN BOYCHOIR. A choir of young male singers resident at the American Boychoir School in Princeton, New Jersey. It was founded in 1937 in Columbus, Ohio, by Herbert Huffman, whose aim was to provide a learning environment in which the experience of performing great choral literature would foster the well-rounded development of boys. The group moved to Princeton in 1950, and changed its name to the American Boychoir in 1980. The choir tours extensively, both at home and abroad. From 1985 to 2001 the choir was conducted by James Litton. AMERICAN CHORAL DIRECTORS ASSOCIATION (ACDA). American choral organization. Founded in 1959, ACDA is a nonprofit organization, whose mission is to “promote excellence in choral music through performance, composition, publication, research, and teaching.” It is organized by region and state, each having its own conventions, newsletters, festivals, etc. National conventions are held biennially in odd-numbered years; they alternate with divisional conventions, held in even-numbered years. ACDA’s official publication is the Choral Journal, which is issued 10 times each year. AMERICAN CHORAL FOUNDATION. A foundation formed in 1954 by Margaret Hillis. It publishes the American Choral Review and the Research Memorandum Series, both distributed by Chorus America. AMSTERDAM BAROQUE CHOIR. See KOOPMAN, TON. ANDRIESSEN, HENDRIK [FRANCISCUS] (17 SEPTEMBER 1892–12 APRIL 1981). Dutch composer, organist, and teacher. His organ and choral works (most of which have organ accompaniment) played a leading role in the renewal of Catholic liturgical music in the Netherlands. Favoring a French classicist approach in which beauty is seen in objective terms, he wrote music characterized by melodiousness, relatively conventional harmonies, and a generally contemplative mood. Among his choral works are some 20 masses, including Missa in Honorem Ss Cordis, for 2 vv. and org. (1919); Missa Diatonica, for 6 vv. (1935); Missa Christus Rex, for chorus, male chorus, and org. (1942); Missa Cogitationes cordis, for 4 vv. congregation, and org. (1960); and Missa ter dankzegging [Mass of Thanksgiving], for chorus, congregation, and org. (1972). Most of his\n\n12 •\n\nANERIO, FELICE\n\nother three dozen sacred choral works have Latin texts; among them are a Magnificat for chorus and org. (1937), a Te Deum for chorus and org. (1943, orchestrated 1946), and a handful of psalm settings. He also wrote some two dozen secular pieces, most of them unaccompanied. Noteworthy examples are Sonnet de Pierre de Ronsard (1917), Omaggio a Marenzio (1965), and Carmen saeculare, for S, T, chorus, and orch. (1968). ANERIO, FELICE (C. 1560–26/27 SEPTEMBER 1614). Italian composer, brother of Giovanni Francesco Anerio. He worked in Rome, ultimately succeeding Giovanni Pierluigi da Palestrina in 1594 as papal composer. At the beginning of his career he wrote madrigals; later he turned to sacred music. Like his brother, he associated himself with the work of Filippo Neri, and wrote some works in theatrical style for his Oratory. Surviving works include canzonettas, madrigals, sacred madrigals (eight of which are for double choir), sacred canzonettas, masses (some of which are polychoral), other liturgical music, and motets. ANERIO, GIOVANNI FRANCESCO (BORN C. 1567; BURIED 12 JUNE 1630). Italian composer and organist, who worked in Rome (active at Filippo Neri’s Congregazione dell’Oratorio), Verona, and Warsaw, Poland. He employed both conservative (polyphonic) and progressive styles, the former derived from Giovanni Pierluigi da Palestrina (though now usually with continuo), the latter following the new theatrical trends being developed in Italy at the beginning of the 17th century. His works include madrigals and much sacred music, including masses (for four to 12 voices) and other liturgical music, psalm settings, and a great many motets. The works in his Teatro armonico spirituale of 1619, intended for devotional exercises in Roman oratories, and notable for intensity of expression and obbligato instrumental writing (new to Rome). ANGLICAN CHORAL MUSIC. See ENGLISH CATHEDRAL MUSIC OF THE REFORMATION AND RESTORATION; ANTHEM. ANIMUCCIA, GIOVANNI (C. 1520–C. 20 MARCH 1571). Italian composer. Originally from Florence, he was in Rome by 1550, where he served Cardinal Guido Ascanio Sforza (1518–64). In 1555 he succeeded Giovanni Pierluigi da Palestrina as director of the Cappella Giulia, a position he retained until his death, at which time\n\nANTHEM\n\n• 13\n\nPalestrina returned to the position. He was associated with the religious gatherings of Filippo Neri, for which he composed two collections of laude. The first (published in 1563) contains standard works in Italian for four voices; the second (1570), is more adventurous, comprising settings of both Italian and Latin texts in contrasting textures of two to eight voices. In 1567 he published a book of masses for four to six voices, written according to the requirements of the Council of Trent, namely, that the text be intelligible, that chant be given its proper place, and that anything obviously secular be avoided. Accordingly, the masses paraphrase chant throughout; thus they revisit a style that had received little attention since the time of Josquin des Prez. Animuccia’s other publications include 3 volumes of contrapuntal madrigals for four to six voices (among which are some madrigal cycles), 1 volume of motets for five voices (many of which paraphrase chant), 1 volume of three-voice motets and madrigals (among which are some madrigali spirituali), and a collection of 20 Magnificats for four voices, characterized by continuously changing textures. See also ANERIO, FELICE. ANTHEM. A choral setting of an English text to be performed as part of a church service. The term originally derived from antiphon. Although analogous to the motet, the anthem is essentially English in its origin and development. After the Reformation in England it came to mean a polyphonic work for the Anglican liturgy. Earliest examples of anthems are found in the Wanley and Lumley Partbooks; in addition to anonymous works, they include compositions by Robert Johnson, William Mundy, John Sheppard, Thomas Tallis, and Christopher Tye. Their works are generally simple four-part polyphonic settings in syllabic style. Some of them are contrafacta of Latin motets. During the last decades of the 16th century, verse anthems began to appear: larger works in which verses sung by soloist(s) with independent accompaniment (organ or instruments) alternate with choruses sung by the choir, doubled by the instrument(s). Verse anthems soon became more popular among composers than full anthems. Anthem composers of the pre-Restoration era included William Byrd, Thomas Morley, Thomas Tomkins, Thomas Weelkes, Orlando Gibbons, William Child, William and Henry Lawes, and Walter Porter, among lesser figures. Their works remained largely unaffected by Continental trends: neither the polychoral style nor the developing\n\n14 •\n\nANTHEM\n\nItalian theatrical style had much influence. After the restoration of the English monarchy in 1660 (when elaborate church services resumed) composers such as Matthew Locke and Henry Cooke worked at the Chapel Royal. When King Charles II instituted a larger string ensemble (modeled after the Vingt-quatre violons du Roi of Louis XIV), verse anthems with orchestral accompaniments and interludes (“orchestral anthems”) became popular. Composers included Pelham Humfrey, John Blow, and especially Henry Purcell. With the decline of the Chapel Royal after the accession of James II (1685), interest turned from liturgical music to opera and concert music. The anthem accordingly declined in importance, although some significant anthems were written by George Frideric Handel, William Croft, Maurice Greene, and William Boyce. The decline of English church music continued through the rest of the 1700s, though some worthy anthems were written by Jonathan Battishill and Samuel Wesley, who championed the music of Johann Sebastian Bach. During the reign of Queen Victoria (r. 1837–1901), a revival took place. Leading composers included Frederick A. G. Ouseley, Robert Pearsall, Henry Smart, and Thomas Walmisley, and especially, Samuel Sebastian Wesley (whose anthems were influenced by oratorio and could last 20 minutes); less individualistic anthems were composed by Joseph Barnby, John Stainer, and Arthur Sullivan. During the 20th century, Hubert Parry and Charles Villiers Stanford made significant contributions to reviving a distinctive English anthem style. Lesser composers included Eric Thiman and Charles Wood. The works of later English composers, Ralph Vaughan Williams, Gustav Holst, Arnold Bax, William Walton, Benjamin Britten, Herbert Howells, William Mathias, and John Tavener (who converted to Greek Orthodoxy), tend to be less suited for regular liturgical use. In the United States the first anthems were ones imported from England during the later 1700s. While native composers such as William Billings began to make important contributions, English anthems continued to provide the standard repertory, as is demonstrated by the high number of English composers represented in The Boston Handel and Haydn Society Collection of Church Music published by Lowell Mason in 1822 (reprinted many times). After 1850 many American composers went to Germany for study. Upon returning to the United\n\nARCHER, VIOLET\n\n• 15\n\nStates they began writing challenging anthems beyond the reach of volunteer church choirs. Accordingly, there arose a demand for simpler material, which led to the publication of unassuming pieces such as those issued by Edmund Lorenz in The Choir Leader (a monthly publication modeled after Novello’s Musical Times). Leading anthem composers around the turn of the century were Dudley Buck and Horatio Parker. While Parker’s works were more sophisticated, Buck’s anthems were more popular. Later 20th-century composers of anthems in North America included F. Melius Christiansen, Leo Sowerby, Clarence Dickinson, Tertius Noble, Healey Willan (the latter two British-born), Daniel Pinkham, Alan Hovhaness, and Lee Hoiby, among others. ANTIPHON. A liturgical chant usually sung both before and after a psalm or canticle. ANTIPHONAL. A “call and response” style of performance in which two or more distinct groups perform in alternation. ANTIPHONY. Music written in antiphonal style. The performing forces are divided into distinct, often spatially separated groups, which respond to each other in contrasting ways. See also POLYCHORAL STYLE. ARCADELT, JACQUES (?1507–14 OCTOBER 1568). FrancoFlemish composer active in Italy (Florence and Rome) and France. In 1539 he was appointed to the Julian Chapel, in 1540 to the Sistine Chapel. He remained in Rome until returning to France in 1551. In contrast to a handful of sacred works (among them, three masses) Arcadelt’s secular output includes about 120 chansons and about 250 madrigals. Most of both genres are for four voices. It was for his madrigals that Arcadelt became most famous. Their accessibility led to an immediate and lasting popularity—his first volume was reprinted 58 times during his lifetime, ensuring that their creator’s legacy continued long after his death. ARCHER, VIOLET (24 APRIL 1913–21 FEBRUARY 2000). Canadian composer and educator whose studies with Béla Bartók and Paul Hindemith influenced her style. An untiring promoter of Canadian music and 20th-century compositions in general, she produced a wide-ranging body of work, including about 30 choral works, among them settings of biblical psalms and other sacred texts. Larger works\n\n16 •\n\nARGENTO, DOMINICK\n\ninclude Choruses from “The Bacchae,” for female chorus and orch. (1938); Leaves of Grass, for SATB and orch. (1940); Apocalypse, for S, mixed chorus, brass, and timp. (1958); and Paul Bunyan, for mixed chorus and pf. (1966). ARGENTO, DOMINICK (27 OCTOBER 1927– ). American composer who studied with Luigi Dallapiccola and Henry Cowell, known especially for his operas. Among his choral works are Gloria, for SATB and pf./org. (1963; arr. for SATB, org., perc., hp., and strs. in the opera The Masque of Angels, 1964); Sanctus, for SSAATTBB and pf./org. (1963, also used in Masque of Angels); The Revelation of St. John the Divine, for T, male chorus, brass, and perc. (1966); Let All the World in Every Corner Sing, for SATB, brass qt., timp., and org. (1980); Jonah and the Whale, for T. Bar., nar., SATB, and chamber ens. (1973); I Hate and I Love, for SATB and perc. (1982); Te Deum (Verba Domini cum verbis populi), for SATB and orch. (1987); The Vision, a motet for chorus and str. qt. (2000); Orpheus, for SSA (2002); and Evensong: Of Love and Angels (in memory of Carolyn Bailey Argento, 1930–2006), for S, treble, reader, chorus, and orch. (2007). ARIA. Most commonly, a lyrical vocal solo with instrumental accompaniment within a work of operatic style (e.g., opera, oratorio, or cantata). In contrast to recitative, its rhythm is metrically regular, and its text often set melismatically. In dramatic terms, it usually represents a pause in the dramatic action, during which a character conveys his or her reaction to the situation. In the later 17th and early 18th centuries the da capo aria became very popular—its ABA structure encouraging embellishment during the repeated section. The name derives from the practice of indicating the repetition of the A section with the rubric “da capo.” ARIOSO. A lyrical style of vocal solo writing, whose regular tempo contrasts with the declamatory and unmetered style of recitative; a short passage in this style, often appearing at the end (or middle) of a recitative. ARMSTRONG, ANTON (26 APRIL 1956– ). American choral conductor and teacher. A graduate of St. Olaf College (Northfield, Minnesota), he returned to his alma mater in 1990 to conduct the St. Olaf\n\nAUGENMUSIK\n\n• 17\n\nChoir. He is active internationally as a guest conductor and lecturer. His area of expertise is youth and children’s choral music, and since 1998 he has served as the founding director of the Youth Choral Academy of the Oregon Bach Festival. He is editor of a multicultural choral series published by Earthsongs Publications and coeditor of the revised St. Olaf Choral Series issued by Augsburg Fortress Publishers. In 2006 he received the Robert Foster Cherry Award for Great Teaching from Baylor University. ARNELL, RICHARD (15 SEPTEMBER 1917– ). English composer and professor of music theory who made numerous trips to the United Sates. He is known primarily for his instrumental works and film scores. His choral works include The War God, op. 36, a cantata for chorus and orch. (1949); Ode to the West Wind, op. 59, for chorus and orch. (1949); Town Crier, op. 118, for speaker, chorus, and orch. (1970); and Xanadu, for chorus and orch. (1993). ARNOLD, SAMUEL (10 AUGUST 1740–22 OCTOBER 1802). English composer (especially of works for the stage), organist, conductor, and editor. His extant choral works include some 9 oratorios, 9 odes, 6 services, 17 anthems, several published volumes of hymns and psalms, and catches, canons, and glees. AUBER, DANIEL FRANÇOIS ESPRIT (29 JANUARY 1782–12 MAY 1871). French composer known for his opéras comiques. As a youth he studied composition privately for three years with Luigi Cherubini. His early career was devoted to opera. In 1842 he became the director of the Paris Conservatoire (where he emphasized vocal instruction), and in 1852 he became maître de chapelle to Napoleon III. His choral works, which are little known, date mostly from this later stage of his life. They include some 40 pieces for the Mass (mass movements and settings of “O salutaris”), more than a dozen other sacred motets, and secular cantatas. In general the works written for the royal chapel are homophonic and melodydominated. Most of them exist in two versions: one with organ (and perhaps harp) and one with orchestra. AUGENMUSIK. A term used to describe musical notation whose meaning can be seen in the notation but not heard in the sound. It was common in madrigals of the Renaissance era. Examples include\n\n18 •\n\nBACH, CARL PHILIPP EMANUEL\n\nthe use of black notes used to signify blackness, night, or mourning; white notes to suggest light, day, or even eyes.\n\n–B– BACH, CARL PHILIPP EMANUEL (8 MARCH 1714–14 DECEMBER 1788). German composer, keyboard player, and church musician. As a son of Johann Sebastian Bach, Philipp Emanuel attended the Thomasschule in Leipzig, where his father was Kantor. Shortly before 1740 he gained his first major music position—that of harpsichord player in the orchestra at the court of Crown Prince Frederick of Prussia (later Frederick the Great), an avid music lover. The situation in Berlin was not a happy one for Bach, and he made several unsuccessful attempts to gain a church position (among them, two applications to follow in his father’s footsteps in Leipzig). C. P. E. Bach eventually succeeded Georg Philipp Telemann as director of the principal churches in Hamburg, taking up his duties in 1768. There he relied to a great extent on the works of others. Although he wrote many Passions, his settings are actually pastiches that borrow choruses and other music from the works of others (his own father among them). For special occasions, however, he wrote original music. In addition to about 20 Passions, his choral works include about 20 cantatas and choruses, and several oratorios. Noteworthy is Heilig, a work for double chorus, 2 ob., bn., 3 tpt., timp., str., and continuo (1776), which has a striking double fugue. Bach’s oratorios received considerable attention, their fame reaching beyond German borders. They include Die Israeliten in der Wüste (1769), Die Auferstehung und Himmelfahrt Jesu (1774), and Du Göttlicher (1770), a Passion cantata based on his first St. Matthew Passion. BACH COLLEGIUM JAPAN. See SUZUKI, MASAAKI. BACH, JOHANN CHRISTIAN (5 SEPTEMBER 1735–1 JANUARY 1782). German composer active in Milan and London. The youngest son of Johann Sebastian Bach, Johann Christian converted to Catholicism and accordingly wrote liturgical music for the Catholic rite, including about 20 works for soloists, chorus, and orchestra (among them, mass movements, 3 Magnificats, and psalm settings). He also\n\nBACH, JOHANN SEBASTIAN\n\n• 19\n\nwrote 1 English anthem and 1 or 2 each of odes, cantatas, oratorios, and serenatas in Italian or English. Unlike his instrumental works, the sacred works are often conservative in style, with polyphonic or antiphonal passages paying homage to tradition. BACH, JOHANN CHRISTOPH (BORN 8 DECEMBER 1642; BURIED 2 APRIL 1703). German composer and organist. He was the uncle of Johann Sebastian Bach, active in Eisenach as church organist and court harpsichordist, and was held in high regard by the family as a composer. Therefore he probably had a significant influence on his young nephew. His choral works include 11 motets (five of them for a single five-part chorus and six for a double four-part chorus), and a half-dozen vocal concertos with demanding instrumental parts (including two for five-part double chorus). BACH, JOHANN SEBASTIAN (21 MARCH 1685–28 JULY 1750). German composer and organist. During his lifetime he was renowned as an organ virtuoso; after his death (especially from the beginning of the 19th century) his status as a composer rose to unparalleled heights. In his music expressive beauty and formidable structural complexity come together, clothed in a language that synthesizes many of the styles and techniques of his day, while surpassing its models in originality and coherence. His own prowess as an organist evidently led him to expect much of others, for his music places great technical demands on the performer—in particular, the difficulty of Bach’s vocal writing lies in its “instrumental” character. His unsurpassed mastery of counterpoint (especially fugue) and harmonic invention had clear and direct influence on composers of later generations, including Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart, Ludwig van Beethoven, Robert Schumann, Felix Mendelssohn, and Johannes Brahms, once they had encountered his music. Born into a family that had produced church musicians for generations, Bach apparently received his first keyboard lessons from his older brother, Johann Christoph, an organist in Ohrdruf, after the death of his mother and father in 1694 and 1695, respectively. There he stayed until 1700, when he enrolled in the school at St. Michael’s Church in Lüneburg (near Hamburg), where he sang in the Mettenchor, an ensemble of about 15 choristers, and received free schooling. He traveled more than once to Hamburg, where he\n\n20 •\n\nBACH, JOHANN SEBASTIAN\n\nwas influenced by J. A. Reincken, the organist at St. Catherine’s Church. During this time he also became acquainted with French style and taste, due to the influence of the nearby court at Celle, with its orchestra of French musicians. After a brief stint at the minor court of Duke Johann Ernst in Weimar, Bach assumed his first significant post as organist at the New Church in Arnstadt (1703–7). There he was soon in conflict with the consistory due to a disagreement about the extent of his duties and some unruly students. After overextending a leave of absence to hear Dietrich Buxtehude in Lübeck, Bach accepted an organ position at St. Blasius Church in Mühlhausen, where he stayed for only one year. Although he was not expected to produce cantatas regularly in either Arnstadt or Mühlhausen, he wrote some of his earliest cantatas during these years (e.g., BWV 106 and BWV 71). When he resigned his position at Mühlhausen in 1708, he stated that he had experienced hindrance in his life’s goal of instituting a “wellregulated church music.” The fact that his pastor was a Pietist may have contributed to the congregation’s apparent antipathy toward elaborate church music. In 1708 Bach assumed the position of court organist at the court of Duke Wilhelm Ernst August (the older brother to his former employer). Bach composed many of his organ works during this time. It was also during these years that he familiarized himself with the music of Antonio Vivaldi. Until 1714, when the title Konzertmeister was conferred on him, he was not responsible for the regular production of cantatas; thereafter he was expected to produce one cantata every four weeks. Because of a family feud between the two ducal courts in Weimer, Bach eventually fell out of favor with Duke Wilhelm. He accordingly demanded his release so that he could accept an offer from the Prince of Anhalt-Cöthen, where in 1717 he became Kapellmeister at the court. Because the prince was Calvinist rather than Lutheran, Bach’s duties were largely related to the production of instrumental music and the occasional cantata for birthdays or holidays. At the end of 1721, the music-loving prince married. Unfortunately his bride was not nearly so interested in music. By 1722, when Johann Kuhnau died in Leipzig, Bach was ready to apply for the vacant position. Although he was not the town council’s first choice, Bach eventually got the post, and he moved there with his family in 1723.\n\nBACH, JOHANN SEBASTIAN\n\n• 21\n\nIn Leipzig Bach assumed the most prominent music position in the city, a post with dual titles and roles. As Kantor he was responsible for the music education of the boys enrolled at the Thomasschule. As director musices he was responsible for the musical activity of the city, above all, for providing music in the four principal churches. Bach began his duties on 30 May, the first Sunday after Trinity, at the Nikolaikirche. During the next 27 years, until his death in 1750, he wrote most of his vocal works, including almost all of the surviving, securely attributed cantatas—about 210 in number, of which approximately 16 are secular (questions of attribution and the existence of works in multiple versions make it difficult to establish unequivocal totals), the Magnificat, the St. Matthew Passion, the Christmas Oratorio, and the Mass in B Minor. The St. John Passion, too, belongs to the Leipzig period, although at least parts of it were evidently composed earlier. Bach’s weekly obligations in the four churches were divided among four ensembles comprising students from the Thomasschule, professional town musicians, and instrumentalists from the university as needed. While he himself directed the best choir (a group of 12 to 16 members), appearing on alternate Sundays in the Thomaskirche and the Nikolaikirche, student prefects led the other three groups. For the primary churches, Bach was expected not only to prepare but also to compose the principal music (Hauptmusik) for Sunday services. Such pieces were defined functionally—they served as musical exegesis of the day’s scriptural theme(s)—and were not yet called cantatas. (Not until the 19th century was the term was applied generally to such works, notably by Philipp Spitta and the editors of the Bach Gesellschaft, who were primarily interested in their stylistic characteristics.) He also provided vocal music for special occasions such as weddings, funerals, inaugurations of newly elected city officials, and—at his insistence—the orations and four yearly festivals (Christmas, Easter, Whitsunday, and Reformation Day) at the University Church (St. Paul’s Church). Since Bach did not have a large body of cantatas on which to draw, he began composing immediately. His first two cantatas were particularly ambitious: BWV 75, Die Elenden sollen essen and BWV 76, Die Himmel erzählen die Ehre Gottes are large, 14-movement works, about 40 minutes in duration, with matching chiastic structures. Within a few years, Bach had produced several liturgical cycles. According to his\n\n22 •\n\nBACH, JOHANN SEBASTIAN\n\nobituary, there were five cycles in all. Of the estimated 300 cantatas, however, only 200 survive. According to the chronology established by scholars in the 20th century, the five cycles may be dated thus: I (1723–24), II (an unfinished cycle based on chorales, 1724–25), III (1725–27), IV (a cycle using texts by Picander, 1728–29?), V (?–1740s?). Bach clearly slowed his cantata production after 1730, perhaps in part because of discouragement with his work environment. One of the most important documents of the time, the so-called Entwurf (“Short but most necessary draft for a well appointed Church Music”), makes clear his dissatisfaction with the number of musicians available to him. This memorandum has become the object of much scholarly debate, for in it Bach argues that at least 12 singers were needed for each choir—a statement that has been interpreted by Joshua Rifkin and others to mean that, while Bach was requesting 12–16 members per choir, he was not implying that he would use the entire roster for cantata performances; on the contrary, that he actually used only one singer per part. In cantata performances Bach himself directed the musicians (often apparently from the harpsichord, which was frequently used to double the continuo part), while the regular organists served as primary continuo players. Other choral elements in the Sunday service included an introit motet, usually taken from the Florilegium Portense by Erhard Bodenschatz—a collection of Renaissance motets that was later expanded under the name Florilegium Portense (1618–21), and a Kyrie and Gloria (rendered as chant or polyphony in whichever church the first choir was singing). The introit motets were performed without instrumental doublings but with continuo (harpsichord) accompaniment. Some of Bach’s greatest vocal works were composed for special occasions. One of these, Bach’s Magnificat (surviving in two versions), was evidently originally written for his first Christmas in Leipzig (1723). At that time it included four interpolated movements with texts appropriate for Christmas Day. When Bach revived the work in the early 1730s he moved it to the key of D, added flutes to the orchestration, made a few instrument substitutions, and removed the movements specific to Christmas. The St. John Passion was first performed at the afternoon Vespers Service on Good Friday, 7 April 1724. Bach revised the work at least three times (1725, about 1732, and 1749); in the final version Bach\n\nBACH, JOHANN SEBASTIAN\n\n• 23\n\nrestored previously deleted movements, largely reestablished the original sequence, and enriched the orchestration. For many years it was thought that the St. Matthew Passion was first performed in the 1729 Good Friday afternoon service at the Thomaskirche in Leipzig. More recent research has suggested a performance already two years earlier: 11 April 1727. Longer and more reflective than the St. John Passion, and written for the more expansive forces of double choir and double orchestra, the work is considered to be one of Bach’s greatest masterpieces. After Bach’s death, the work lay neglected for decades, until it was revived in 1829 (one hundred years after its assumed first performance) by Felix Mendelssohn, in a performance that sparked the Bach revival of the 19th century. The Christmas Oratorio (1734–35), essentially consists of six separate cantatas to be performed on different days between Christmas Day and Epiphany. Perhaps the most musically significant aspect of the work is its extensive use of parody—much of it is borrowed from Cantatas 213, 214, and 215, all congratulatory works for the Elector of Saxony and his family. Bach’s six or more motets were also occasional works, several of them apparently composed for funerals. There is still dispute concerning their number; at issue is the authenticity of several works and whether certain works should be classified as motets or cantata movements. Except for BWV 227, Jesu meine Freude (which is written for five voices), the motets call for a double choir. Unlike the cantatas, they have no solo writing. While instruments were no doubt used on many occasions to double the vocal parts (such parts exist for BWV 226, Der Geist hilft unser Schwachheit auf—strings doubling one choir, woodwinds doubling the other), there are no obbligato parts in the six traditionally identified motets. After 1729, when Bach assumed direction of the Leipzig collegium musicum (an association of university students and professional musicians, which gave weekly concerts), Bach composed a number of secular cantatas, of which about 15 survive; most of these were probably performed at one time or another by the Collegium Musicum. Among these is the Coffee Cantata. While Bach never composed an opera, he demonstrated with these works that he had the dramatic flair for doing so. Bach’s greatest work is arguably the Mass in B Minor. Compiled at the end of his life, the work began as a set of parts for a Kyrie and\n\n24 •\n\nBACH, JOHANN SEBASTIAN\n\nGloria, which he sent in 1733 to the elector of Saxony, Frederick Augustus II (1696–1763), in hopes of gaining a title as court composer. The rest of the mass was not assembled until the end of Bach’s life (sometime between August 1748 and October 1749): various movements (many of them adaptations from previous works) were gathered and numbered into three primary divisions: the missa became no. 1, the Credo (Symbolum Nicenum) became no. 2; the Sanctus, no. 3; and the Osanna / Benedictus / Agnus Dei et / Dona nobis pacem, no. 4. The result is a work of grand proportions. Because it is too long for most liturgical settings, Bach’s purpose for the work is unclear. Incorporating a wide variety of techniques and styles, it demonstrates Bach as the supreme master in a genre that had for centuries been considered the most important in church music. Despite the heterogeneous origins of the individual movements, Bach was able to impose a remarkable unity on the whole. In particular, the Credo forms a symmetrical structure in which the “Crucifixus” marks the center of a chiastic arch. Furthermore, by reusing the music of “Gratias” in “Dona nobis” Bach provided cyclical unity on a large scale. During the late 1730s and the following decade, Bach took a particular interest in the old polyphonic style of Latin liturgical music. This preoccupation resulted in some transcriptions of works by Giovanni Pierluigi da Palestrina, among others, and the creation of four short masses (BWV 233–236)—two-movement works (Kyrie and Gloria) appropriate for the Lutheran liturgy. Dating from about 1738, these four works are based on music from earlier cantata movements. Bach’s vocal works display a wide range of formal devices and styles. The earliest cantatas (e.g., BWV 4, “Christ lag in Todesbanden”) did not yet incorporate arias and recitatives in the modern theatrical manner. In time, however, they resembled operatic models more and more, with clearly distinguished recitatives and arias setting poetry especially designed for these forms. In Leipzig, where the regular production of church cantatas was his principal responsibility, he typically began his cantatas with an extended choral movement (often on a biblical text), ending them with a simple four-part chorale. In between stands a series of alternating recitatives, arias, and sometimes additional chorales, with a wide range of imaginative instrumentation. In his chorale cantatas, the hymn tunes and texts are retained in the opening and closing movements (occasionally also in inner\n\nBACH, JOHANN SEBASTIAN\n\n• 25\n\nmovements), while the others (whose poetic texts often paraphrased intervening chorale stanzas) are set as freely composed arias and recitatives. The chorale cantata may have been Bach’s own invention, for Bach’s contemporaries made little use of chorale melodies in their cantatas. Bach’s fondness for chorales is evident even beyond the chorale cantata cycle. Many of his works incorporate chorales in one way or another; the Christmas Oratorio, for example, includes 15 of them. The three works that Bach called oratorios (the Easter Oratorio, BWV 249 [1725], the Ascension Oratorio, BWV 11 [1735], and the Christmas Oratorio, BWV 248 [1734–35]), are all basically parodies of previously composed secular cantatas. The two surviving Passions are of the Oratorio Passion type, in which the entire biblical text is retained verbatim (with dialogue distributed among soloists and chorus) and reflective commentary is provided by additional intervening arias, chorales, and even recitatives. In 1737, Bach’s musical style came under criticism by the writer J. A. Scheibe for being unnatural and unnecessarily complicated. While other writers took to Bach’s defense, the criticism pointed out that Bach’s music was not in keeping with the new aesthetic ideals of the Enlightenment. Nevertheless, works such as Cantata 181, Leichtgesinnte Flattergeister (1724), the Coffee Cantata (c. 1734), the “Christe eleison” of what later became the Mass in B minor (1733), and the Peasant Cantata (1742) demonstrate that he was capable of writing in that style if he chose to do so. After Bach’s death much of his music remained in obscurity for a century. Felix Mendelssohn’s revival of the St. Matthew Passion did much to revive interest in Bach’s works, and in 1850 a Bach Society was formed to publish a complete edition of his works. While performances of the time were greatly romanticized with large choruses and orchestras, dramatic contrasts in dynamics and tempo, and even “improved” orchestrations, they served to spread Bach’s fame. During the 20th century, a growing historicism gave rise to attempts to recreate authentic performances of Bach’s works. Leaders in this movement included Nikolaus Harnoncourt, Gustav Leonhardt, Joshua Rifkin, and Andrew Parrott. Others, such as Helmuth Rilling, argue that the significance of Bach’s works is best communicated through performances moderated by present-day considerations. It is no doubt a testimony to the inner logic of Bach’s\n\n26 •\n\nBACH, P. D. Q.\n\nmusic that it sustains its appeal through a range of interpretations. See also other members of the Bach family. BACH, P. D. Q. See SCHICKELE, PETER. BACH, WILHELM FRIEDEMANN (22 NOVEMBER 1710–1 JULY 1784). Composer and organist, eldest son of Johann Sebastian Bach. Trained in keyboard playing and composition by his father, he also studied at the Thomasschule and at the University of Leipzig. Throughout his career he was known for his skills as an organist, especially for his talent for improvisation. In 1733 he successfully competed for the position of organist at the Sophienkirche in Dresden. In 1746 he became organist at the Liebfrauenkirche in Halle. This was a more prestigious position, and it included responsibility for producing cantatas on feast days and on every third Sunday. To fulfill his duties, Wilhelm Friedemann often availed himself of his father’s compositions. Due to various conflicts with authorities, he became increasingly unhappy, and he eventually left Halle in 1764. Thereafter he was unsuccessful in securing another permanent position despite his reputation as an organ virtuoso. As a composer he focused especially on keyboard music. His extant choral compositions include some 22 cantatas (of which six are at least partly parodies), 2 masses, and a few other sacred works. BADINGS, HENK (17 JANUARY 1907–26 JUNE 1987). Dutch composer. He was born in Java, where his father served as an officer in the Dutch East Indies army. Orphaned at an early age, he was subsequently raised in the Netherlands. His guardian opposed his desire for a career in music, forcing him to study mine engineering and geology instead. Nevertheless, he taught himself composition, and in 1934 he received an appointment in composition and theory at the Rotterdam Conservatory. During the German occupation he was director of the state conservatory in The Hague (1941–45). For his collaboration with the Nazis, he was shunned after the war. Nevertheless, his international reputation as a composer began to grow. In 1960–61 he directed the electronic music studio at the University of Utrecht, and from 1961 until 1977 he taught acoustics there, while simultaneously holding an appointment in composition at the Stuttgart Conservatory (1962–72). A prolific composer, Badings became renowned for his experimentation with new scales (especially the 31-note scale), micro in-\n\nBALLETTO\n\n• 27\n\ntervals, and new tuning systems, as well as with electronic techniques (often combining conventional instruments and electronic media). Most of his music, however, is acoustic, covering all genres. Among the choral compositions are some 17 works with orchestra, including the oratorio Apocalypse, for solo vv., chorus, and orch. (1948); Symphony no. 6 (1953); Psalm 147, for children’s chorus, chbr. chorus, chorus, and orch. (1959); Hymnus Ave Maris Stella, for female chorus and orch. (1965); and numerous cantatas, among them, the “Whitman Cantata” (Kantate VIII), for nar., chorus, and winds (1973). Some 30 additional works for mixed chorus include Trios chansons bretonnes (1946); Missa brevis (1946); Maria, 14 songs for solo vv., chbr. chorus, fl., and vc. (1947); Languentibus in purgatorio (1959); Cinq poèmes chinois (1973); Requiem (1978); and Missa antiphonica (1985). He also wrote more than 20 pieces or sets of pieces for male chorus, and another dozen for female chorus. BAIRSTOW, EDWARD (22 AUGUST 1874–1 MAY 1946). English organist, composer, conductor, and teacher. As conductor of the York Musical Society (1913–39) and of the Leeds Philharmonic Society (1917 until his death), he gained a significant reputation. His own compositions include 29 highly regarded anthems (e.g., I Sat Down under His Shadow) and some services. BALLADE. In the context of the Medieval and Renaissance eras, one of the French formes fixes, with the pattern aab + refrain (where letters designate musical units). It normally includes three stanzas. BALLATA. Italian dance song and poetic-musical form of the 1300s. The form of the ballata corresponds to that of the French virelai: AbbaA, where letters designate musical units, and the use of uppercase letters indicates repetition of text as well as music. BALLETTO (BALLETT). The vocal balletto is a simple, syllabic, dancelike, strophic, and primarily homophonic piece with a refrain (which is sometimes polyphonic) on nonsense syllables such as “fa-la-la.” It is typically in two sections, each repeated, with the refrain ending each section. The balletto flourished between 1690 and 1625 and was evidently related to its instrumental counterparts. Michael Praetorius and Thomas Morley both credit Giovanni Gastoldi with inventing the genre. Other composers include Adriano Banchieri, and Orazio Vecchi. Italian models were imitated in\n\n28 •\n\nBANCHIERI, ADRIANO\n\nGermany by Hans Leo Hassler, and in England (where they were called balletts) by Morley (who actually parodied some of Gastoldi’s works). Other composers include Thomas Weelkes, Francis Pilkington, Thomas Tomkins, and John Hilton. See also CANZONETTA; MADRIGAL; VILLANELLA. BANCHIERI, ADRIANO (3 SEPTEMBER 1568–1634). Italian composer, organist, and writer. A Benedictine monk, he wrote psalm settings, 12 masses (relatively simple settings, so that the words could be understood, as mandated by the Council of Trent), and motets (called by various names; some are for double choir, most are with continuo). His secular works include six volumes of canzonettas for three voices, and six volumes of madrigals (most for five voices, some with continuo). The texts in each of these volumes are related, providing a plot of sorts and producing, in essence, a madrigal comedy. BANTOCK, [SIR] GRANVILLE (7 AUGUST 1868–16 OCTOBER 1946). English composer. A tireless and prolific worker, he produced many large-scale works on heroic and exotic themes (influenced by early Richard Wagner and Richard Strauss), while also promoting the music of Edward Elgar, Hubert Parry, Charles Stanford, and Jean Sibelius. His large works for solo voices, chorus, and orchestra include Omar Khayyám (a vast trilogy of oratorios on Edward FitzGerald’s free translation, 1906–9); The Song of Songs (1922); and The Pilgrim’s Progress (1928). He also wrote ambitious choral symphonies for unaccompanied voices—Atlanta in Calydon (1911), The Vanity of Vanities (1913), and A Pageant of Human Life (1913)—and many other works for male, female, mixed, and children’s choruses. BARBE, HELMUT (28 DECEMBER 1927– ). German composer. He studied with Ernst Pepping, and later held teaching appointments in church music. He has written many choral works, most of them sacred. They combine a wide range of techniques and textures (including 12-tone procedures) with imaginative instrumentation to produce intensely expressive works. Diverse examples include Missa brevis, for chorus, 2 fl., ob., eng. hn., bn., and vc. (1961); Golgatha, for Bar., 3 vv., str., and perc. (1972); Ursuliner Messe, for 4 vv., fl., ob., cl., b. cl., bn., and tpt.; (1972); Te Deum, for Bar., 3 choruses, and orch. (1976); Potsdamer Te Deum, for Mez., 2 choruses, orch., and org.\n\nBARTÓK, BÉLA\n\n• 29\n\n(1992); and Canti di Ungaretti, for chorus, hp., accdn. (1998) [after Antonio Vivaldi]. BARBER, SAMUEL (9 MARCH 1910–23 JANUARY 1981). American composer. His lyricism, directness of expression, sensitivity to text, and chromatic but tonal language have made some of his relatively few choral works enduringly popular. These include Let Down the Bars, O Death (1936); A Stopwatch and an Ordnance Map, for male vv. and 3 timp. (1940); Reincarnations (1937–40); Prayers of Kierkegaard, a complex work for S, A ad lib., T ad lib., chorus, and orch. (1954); and Agnus Dei, for chorus, and org./pf. ad lib. (arr. of 2nd movt. of Str. Qt., 1967). Among the works performed less frequently are the two unaccompanied choruses of op. 42 (Twelfth Night and To Be Sung on the Water [1968]); and The Lovers, op. 43, a cantata for Bar., chorus, and orch. (1971). BARBERSHOP. A form of unaccompanied male four-part singing (in quartets or choruses) that evidently originated in American barbershops around 1900. It is typified by close harmony, with the melody presented by the lower of two tenor parts. The texture is usually chordal, with consonant harmonies that emphasize dominant seventh (or augmented sixth) chords. Lyrics tend to be sentimental. In 1938 the Society for the Preservation and Encouragement of Barber Shop Quartet Singing in America, Inc. (SPEBSQSA) was founded. Women took up the style, and in 1945 formed Sweet Adelines, Inc., the counterpart to the male association. Emphasis in barbershop performance is on precisely tuned, blended, and balanced chords (producing an acoustical effect called the “expanded sound,” “ringing chords,” or “fifth voice”), unified phrasing, and memorized delivery. BARTLE, JEAN ASHWORTH (7 MARCH 1947– ). Canadian choral conductor. In 1978 she founded the Toronto Children’s Chorus, which has received widespread acclaim. She is author of Sound Advice: Becoming a Better Children’s Choir Conductor. BARTÓK, BÉLA (25 MARCH 1881–26 SEPTEMBER 1945). Hungarian composer, pianist, and ethnomusicologist. His eclectic style transformed and synthesized a wide variety of influences (e.g., folk music, Claude Debussy, Igor Stravinsky, Arnold Schoenberg).\n\n30 •\n\nBASSANO, GIOVANNI\n\nBartók saw himself as moving from a Beethoven-like orientation (with emphasis on originality and harmonic construction) toward a Bach-like one (with emphasis on craftsmanship and counterpoint). Bartók first attracted attention as a virtuoso pianist while a student at the Academy of Music in Budapest. As a composer he struggled to find his own style. Enamored at first with the music of Richard Strauss, he soon developed an interest in the peasant music of Hungary, believing that it would provide the way to the development of a truly national style. This interest remained a central focus throughout his life. With Zoltán Kodály, whom he first met in 1905, he tirelessly collected thousands of examples of ethnic folk music (especially Hungarian, Romanian, and Slovak music) analyzing them for their underlying melodic and rhythmic structure. In turn, this music influenced Bartók’s own compositions more and more. In 1940 Bartók fled Nazi expansionism, settling in the United States, where he continued to compose, perform, and lecture. Although most famous for his instrumental works, Bartók nevertheless produced a great number of songs and a lesser number of choral works. Among the latter are Three Village Scenes, for female voices and chbr. orch. (1926); Cantata profana “A kilenc csodaszarvas” [The Nine Enchanted Stags], for T, Bar., double chorus, and orch. (1930); Evening, for male voices (1903); Two Romanian Folksongs, for female voices (c. 1909); Four Old Hungarian Folksongs for male voices (1910); Slovak Folksongs, for male voices (1917); Four Slovak Folksongs, for SATB and pf. (about 1916); Hungarian Folksongs, for mixed voices (1930); Székely Folksongs, for six male voices (1932); Twenty-seven Two- and Three-Part Choruses (traditional Hungarian), for children’s voices (vols. 1–6) or female voices (vols. 7–8) (1935–36); and From Olden Times, for three male vv. (1935). BASSANO, GIOVANNI (1560/61–16 AUGUST 1617). Venetian composer and wind player, known today primarily for his 1585 book on ornamentation and his 1591 book demonstrating how continuous ornamentation could be applied to the music of Adrian Willaert, Clemens non Papa, Thomas Crecquillon, Orlande de Lassus, Cypriano de Rore, Alessandro Striggio, Giovanni Pierluigi da Palestrina, and Luca Marenzio. He also composed chansons, motets, canzonettas, and madrigals.\n\nBAX, ARNOLD\n\n• 31\n\nBASSETT, LESLIE (22 JANUARY 1923– ). American composer. Having studied at the University of Michigan, he taught there from 1952. He was a founding member of the university’s electronic studio, and served as head of the composition department from 1970. His vocal music tends to be instrumental in character. Choral works include The Lamb for SATB and pf. (1952); Out of the Depths (Psalm 130), for SATB and org. (1957); For City, Nation, World, a cantata for T, SATB, children’s chorus ad. lib., congregation, 4 trbn., and org. (1959); Moonrise, for SSA, and 9 insts. (1960); Remembrance, for SATB, and org. (1960); Eclogue, Encomium and Evocation, for SSA, pf., hp., and 2 perc. (1962); Follow Now That Bright Star, a carol for SATB (1962); Prayers for Divine Service, a Latin setting for TTBB and org. (1965); Hear My Prayer, O Lord (Psalm 64), for SA and org. (1965); Notes in the Silence, for SATB and pf. (1966); Collect, for SATB and tape (1969); Moon Canticle, for S, amp. nar., SATB, and vc. (1969); Celebration: in Praise of Earth, for amp. nar., SATB, and orch. (1970); Of Wind and Earth, for SATB and pf. (1973); A Ring of Emeralds, for SATB and pf. (1979); Sing to the Lord (Psalm 95), for SATB and org. (1981); Lord, Who Hast Formed Me, for SATB and org. (1981); Whoe’er She Be, for SSA and pf. (1986); Almighty, Eternal, for SATB and org. (1990); and Maker of Our Being, for SATB and org. (1993). BASSO CONTINUO (CONTINUO, THOROUGHBASS). The foundational bass line of a Baroque composition with its accompanying harmonies, which are realized usually on a keyboard instrument. Numerals above or below the notes indicate the harmonies to be played. BASSO SEGUENTE. A type of basso continuo consisting of the lowest sounding part at any given moment in a musical texture. BATTISHILL, JONATHAN (?MAY 1738–10 DECEMBER 1801). English organist and composer. He was a choirboy at St. Paul’s Cathedral, where he grew to be a fine organist and tenor soloist. His choral works include some 13 anthems with organ accompaniment (the most famous being Call to Remembrance [Psalm 25:6]), songs, hymns, glees, and catches. BAX, [SIR] ARNOLD (8 NOVEMBER 1883–3 OCTOBER 1953). English composer influenced by late Romantic composers. His choral\n\n32 •\n\nBBC SINGERS\n\nworks include some 20 works, seven of which include soloist(s) and orchestra. He also wrote a Gloria, Nunc Dimittis, Te Deum, and Magnificat, for chorus and organ. BBC SINGERS. Professional chamber choir of the British Broadcasting Corporation. Formed in 1924 by Stanford Robinson as the Wireless Chorus, it was later renamed the BBC Chorus, receiving its present name in 1971. Chief conductors have included Leslie Woodgate (1934–61), Peter Gellhorn (from 1961), John Poole (from 1971), Simon Joly (from 1989), Stephen Cleobury (from 1995), and David Hill (from 2007). BEACH, AMY (5 SEPTEMBER 1867–27 DECEMBER 1944). Leading American female composer of her time. A prolific composer, she left about 40 sacred choral works, including Mass in Eflat, for chorus and orch. (1890); Service in A, op. 63, for chorus and org. (completed 1906); The Canticle of the Sun, op. 123, for S, Mez., T, B, 4 vv., and orch. (1928); and much other service music. She also wrote some 35 secular works, many of them being partsongs. About ha"
