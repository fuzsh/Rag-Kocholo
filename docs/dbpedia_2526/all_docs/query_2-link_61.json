        "text": "1 When the Lord turned again the captivity of Sion: then were we like unto them that dream.\n\n2 Then was our mouth filled with laughter: and our tongue with joy.\n\n3 Then said they among the heathen: The Lord hath done great things for them.\n\n4 Yea, the Lord hath done great things for us already: whereof we rejoice.\n\n5 Turn our captivity, O Lord: as the rivers in the south.\n\n6 They that sow in tears: shall reap in joy.\n\n7 He that now goeth on his way weeping, and beareth forth good seed:\n\nshall doubtless come again with joy, and bring his sheaves with him.\n\n1 When the Lord turned again the captivity of Zion,\n\nwe were like them that dream.\n\n2 Then was our mouth filled with laughter, and our tongue with singing: then said they among the heathen, The Lord hath done great things for them.\n\n3 The Lord hath done great things for us; whereof we are glad.\n\n4 Turn again our captivity, O Lord, as the streams in the south.\n\n5 They that sow in tears shall reap in joy.\n\n6 He that goeth forth and weepeth, bearing precious seed, shall doubtless come again with rejoicing, bringing his sheaves with him.\n\n1. When that the Lord again his Zion had forth brought\n\nFrom bondage great, and also servitude extreme,\n\nHis work was such as did surmount man's heart and thought,\n\nSo that we were much like to them, that used to dream:\n\nOur mouths were all with laughter filled then,\n\nAlso our tongues did show us joyful men.\n\n2. The heathen folk were forced then this to confess,\n\nHow that the Lord for them also great things had done:\n\nBut much more we, and therefore can confess no less;\n\nWherefore to joy we have great cause, as we begun;\n\nO Lord, go forth, thou canst our bondage end.\n\nWho to deserts dost flowing rivers send.\n\n3. Full true it is, that they that sow in tears indeed\n\nA time will come when they shall reap in mirth and joy:\n\nThey went and wept in hearing of their precious seed,\n\nFor that their foes full oftentimes did them annoy:\n\nBut their return they joyfully shall see,\n\nTheir sheaves bring home, and not impaired be.\n\nVERSION 1. (L. M.)\n\nSurprising deliverance\n\nWhen God restored our captive state,\n\nJoy was our song, and grace our theme;\n\nThe grace beyond our hopes so great\n\nThat joy appeared a painted dream.\n\nThe scoffer owns Thy hand, and pays\n\nUnwilling honors to Thy name;\n\nWhile we with pleasure shout thy praise,\n\nWith cheerful notes thy love proclaim.\n\nWhen we review our dismal fears,\n\n'Twas hard to think they'd vanish so;\n\nWith God we left our flowing tears,\n\nHe makes our joys like rivers flow.\n\nThe man that in his furrowed field\n\nHis scattered seed with sadness leaves,\n\nWill shout to see the harvest yield\n\nA welcome load of joyful sheaves."
