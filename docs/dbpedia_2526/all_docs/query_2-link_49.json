        "text": "DMA, University of Cincinnati, 2023, College-Conservatory of Music: Conducting\n\nConversations regarding underrepresented composers in concert programming create an exploration of possibilities for both new repertoire and previously unconsidered societal perspectives from antiquity to present. Many historical works by underrepresented or excluded composers are continuing to be discovered. One of the barriers for conductors interested in programming these works is a lack of access to critical and performance editions by scholars of these excluded composers. Herein, I provide access to a scholarly edition of a four-voice motet for the purposes of programming. The music of seventeenth-century Northern Italian nun composers represents the largest body of repertoire in Western European music written by women composers during this period, yet their works and their historical significance are often overlooked and underrepresented in comparison with their male counterparts in choral literature. This document specifically focuses on the nun composer Bianca Maria Meda, a late seventeenth-century Northern Italian nun within the convent, San Martino del Leano in Pavia, whose singular volume of motets are one example of the trove of music written by women and published in the seventeenth century. Included is a critical edition of one of the four-voiced motets, \"In foco ardentissimo\" from her volume of motets entitled Motetti a 1, 2, 3, e 4, con Violini, e Senza Consecrati, published in 1691. An analysis of the seventeenth-century rhetorical figures within the motet provides interpretive insight to the era's performance practice. The document also provides historical context of the broader scope of convent life within seventeenth-century Northern Italy, brief bibliographic information on Meda's life, and perspective regarding how Meda's use of sacred, romantic text in tandem with its musical setting blurs the boundaries between the dichotomous perspectives of sacred and secular genres. This critical edition along with historical context and analysis (open full item for complete abstract)\n\nCommittee: L.

He attempts to delineate all contemporaneous music practiced in and around Paris. The treatise is the earliest to include a formal discussion of secular music, in addition to composed and liturgical, in a systematic and pedagogical fashion. Moreover, addressing sociological functions of specific forms and genres is unique for his time. However, Grocheio's discussions of musical forms, genres, and conventional theoretical issues are frequently ambiguous. This study attempts to address the ambiguity. The liturgical portion has suffered much neglect as scholars have directed their attention to Grocheio's discussion of secular music. However, nearly one-third of Grocheio's treatise is devoted to liturgical music. Hence, this study explores the content, approach, and value of Grocheio's discussion of liturgical music. This information must be evaluated if holistic clarity regarding Ars Musicae is desired. Furthermore, this study provides new interpretations of the more familiar topics encountered in Grocheio research. I proceed by first summarizing and frequently reinterpreting the basic contents of the treatise and authorial background. This constitutes the first two chapters. The heart of the study investigates some ambiguous and previously unaddressed issues of terminology and concept: mode, measuring, the motet, and numeric systems. Though I pursue this goal throughout, the latter task constitutes Chapter 3 in its entirety. If one reads Grocheio's way of thinking, character, and work as a collective text, enlightened ideas surface regarding value embodied in academic interaction of late medieval Parisian culture. Grocheio's work reflects human intellect applied to the domain of music. Because of its approach, it presents a rare opportunity to have a glimpse of a distant and deceptively foreign past, a divide frequently underestimated. The diversity and complexity now thought to be characteristic (open full item for complete abstract)\n\nCommittee: Dr. Edward Nowacki (Advisor) Subjects: Music\n\nDMA, University of Cincinnati, 2006, College-Conservatory of Music : Conducting, Choral Emphasis\n\nThis document presents a modern edition of Michel-Richard de Lalande's motet In convertendo Dominus(1684; revised before 1726) along with information that choral conductors attempting to perform grands motetsshould find immediately useful. This particular grand motetis one of several by Lalande that have not previously been published in modern edition. The document presents a brief historical background of the Bourbon monarchy and the artistic climate that gave birth to the Versailles-style grand motetin the grand siecle. The origins of this genre are explored and the grand motet's development is traced up through the works of Lalande to its popularity throughout the remainder of the eighteenth century at the Concert Spirituel. An overview of the primary sources of Lalande's motets is presented, including facsimiles of title and dedication pages of several important manuscripts, along with translations and descriptions of their contents. An overview of current research and thought on the difficulties and ambiguities of French Baroque performance practice is included in hopes of encouraging performers who might otherwise be hesitant to essay such a study and performance. As we approach the three-hundred-fiftieth anniversary of Lalande's birth, it is this author's hope that this document will find its place in the growing body of research about his affective and exciting oeuvre.\n\nCommittee: Dr. Earl Rivers (Advisor) Subjects: Music\n\nPhD, University of Cincinnati, 2004, College-Conservatory of Music : Music (Musicology)\n\nThis dissertation provides the most complete biography to date of the life of the Genoese musician Simone Molinaro, the first comprehensive analysis and discussion of his sacred music, and the first modern edition of nearly all of his extant sacred music. Molinaro is here revealed as one of the most significant figures in the history of Genoese music and as a composer of considerable depth, skill, and refinement whose music bridged, stylistically as well as chronologically, the late sixteenth and early seventeenth centuries. Chapter One provides a brief historical background of the city of Genoa leading up the time of Molinaro's life, citing relevant social, economic, and cultural markers. Chapter Two centers on the history of the Genoese musical institutions for which Molinaro worked, the music chapels of the Cathedral of San Lorenzo and the Ducal Palace. The biography in Chapter Three includes a discussion of the reception history of Molinaro's music up to the current day. Chapter Four consists of a survey of the texts employed by Molinaro in his publications of sacred motets, and a discussion of their use within the context and culture of northern Italian and Genoese sacred music. In the analytical survey of the works in Chapter Five Molinaro's late sixteenth-century style music is examined from a musical-rhetorical perspective. In addition, the relevance of the concept of imitatio in this music and Molinaro's use of compositional models is analyzed. The melding of traditional sixteenth-century and the newer seventeenth-century stylistic elements in the sacred concertos is discussed within an historical context. Chapter Six outlines the editorial procedures employed in the edition as well as provides a complete erratum of all corrections and emendations to the original prints. The diplomatic transcription of the music that follows will be appealing both to scholars and to performers because of its introduction to the repertoire of the period of a heretofore unkno (open full item for complete abstract)\n\nCommittee: Dr. Edward Nowacki (Advisor) Subjects: Music"
