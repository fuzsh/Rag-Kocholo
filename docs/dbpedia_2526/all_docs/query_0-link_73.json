He received his Ph.D. in theology at Helsinki University in 2011. His publications include Luther’s Theology of Music: Spiritual Beauty and Pleasure (Berlin: De Gruyter, 2013). Xavier Bisaro † was professor of musicology at the Université François-Rabelais and researcher in the Centre d’Études Supérieures de la Renaissance in Tours. His publications focused on the musicological history of divine worship and on liturgi­ cal scholarship in modern France. He also managed the project Cantus Scholarum (www.cantus-scholarum.univ-tours.fr), devoted to school singing in modern Europe. David J. Burn is professor of musicology and head of the Early Music Research Group at the University of Leuven. His research focusses on the later fifteenth and sixteenth centuries, with particular interest for Heinrich Isaac and his contempo­ raries, interactions between chant and polyphony, source-studies, and early-music analysis. Together with Sarah Ann Long, he is co-general editor of the Journal of the Alamire Foundation. Andrew Cichy is director of music at the cathedral of St Stephen in Brisbane, Aus­ tralia. A performer-scholar, his research interests include English Catholic music after the Reformation (on which topic he completed his doctoral thesis at Merton College, Oxford in 2014) and Polish repertoires before 1750. His research has been published by Ashgate and Oxford University Press, and appeared in journals in­ cluding Early Music and Music and Letters.\n\nContributors\n\nMarie-Alexis Colin teaches musicology at the Université Libre de Bruxelles and is a­ djunct professor at the Université de Montréal. She edited the opera omnia of ­Eustache Du Caurroy (with the exception of the Fantasies). Her publications in­ clude articles and book chapters on motets, chansons, and the relationships be­ tween music and territoires in France and the southern Low Countries between 1500 and 1650. With Camilla Cavicchi and Philippe Vendrix, she co-edited La musique en Picardie du xive au xviie siècle (Turnhout: Brepols, 2012). Sarah Davies, organist and musicologist, earned her Ph.D. at New York University in 2010 with a dissertation, supervised by Stanley Boorman, on the geistliche rep­ ertoire in Renaissance Swiss and German tablatures for lute and organ. In recent years she has given papers at musicology, keyboard, iconography, and interdiscipli­ nary conferences in both Europe and America. Her current work includes research into the Toggenburg Hausorgel; the place of the organ in German Lutheran church orders; and an ongoing project assessing the German, British, and American organ sermons of the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries. Henk Jan de Jonge is emeritus professor of New Testament and early Christian litera­ ture at Leiden University. His recent research centres on the origins and early history of the Eucharist. He has published on several Old Testament Pseudepigrapha, includ­ ing the Testaments of the Twelve Patriarchs and the Sibylline Oracles. He is a member of the editorial committee of the Opera omnia Erasmi Roterodami (Amsterdam, 1969–2008; Leiden, 2009–) and acted as supervisory editor of The Correspondence of Joseph Justus Scaliger, ed.

Burn and Grantley McDonald\n\nT\n\nhe ideathat music is more than mere sound, but joins the realms of\n\nthe human, the spiritual, and the divine, is as old as writing about music itself. Pythagoras’s interest in musical intervals was not simply abstract, but reflected on their resemblances to proportions inherent in the universe. For Plato and Aristotle, music was not only a source of pleasure, but was also a therapeutic and ethical tool which worked by affecting the soul directly. While such discussions acknowledged music’s power as educational and spiritually enriching, that very admission also meant acknowledging music’s dangerous and disruptive potential. It is little wonder then that nascent Christianity gave music such a central role in its observances, while carefully delimiting the sorts of music appropriate for worship. Throughout the history of the Church, music has regularly been placed under the critical microscope, both by individual thinkers and at an institutional level. Examination of music’s role in the spiritual and liturgical life of the Church and its members has been ongoing. Nonetheless, the intensity of the thought and the firmness of the answers proposed have varied according to circumstances, with periods during which theological doctrine was most intensely re-evaluated also witnessing the most thoroughgoing reassessments of music’s relationship to doctrine. The European Reformations represent one of the most crucial such junctures, offering rich material for examining the possible relationships between music and theology. The present book aims to contribute to the discourse on this topic by examining music and theology during that time from both Catholic and various Protestant perspectives, including research from musicologists, theologians, Biblical scholars, and Church historians. It is no accident that this book appears Music and Theology in the European Reformations, ed. by David J. Burn, Grantley McDonald, Joseph Verheyden, and Peter De Mey, Turnhout: Brepols 2019 (Épitome musical), pp. 25-32 FHG DOI 10.1484/M.EM-EB.5.116359\n\nDavid J. Burn and Grantley McDonald\n\nin such close proximity to the 500th anniversary of the traditional starting-shot of the Reformations, Martin Luther’s presentation of his Ninety-Five Theses in 1517. Complementing the recent flourishing of scholarly work around the Reformations, the chapters in this book aim to address some of the following questions: What difference did the theological and ecclesiological developments of the sixteenth century make to musical forms and practices? What continuities of practice existed with former times? How was the desire to restore the church to an imagined pristine state manifest in music and liturgy? How did developments in exegesis arising from the massively increased knowledge and access to the Bible in Hebrew and Greek affect the way composers wrote and congregations heard? Why did some reformers embrace music, while others rejected it? Although the sixteenth-century Reformations have often been depicted as uniquely disruptive events, recent research has laid bare their long historical roots. The Catholic Church had a long tradition of internal reform, including fierce debates on the role and place of music.1 Sometimes such reforms were initiated from the top, by popes or reform councils. In his decretal Docta sanctorum patrum (1323/24), Pope John XXIII condemned the liturgical use of modern polyphony, which, in his opinion, detracted from the dignity of the ancient chant, confused the modes, and distracted worshippers by delighting their ears without satisfying them.2 This and similar decrees were often repeated and reinterpreted by later generations. Sometimes calls for reform arose from within, as seen in the mendicant orders in the thirteenth century, or the Jesuits in the sixteenth. Yet some late-medieval reformers, such as Jan Hus, John Wycliffe, and Girolamo Savonarola, put their criticisms so trenchantly that they divided opinion rather than united it. Consequently, their calls for reformation were often frustrated, or at least limited to those who agreed with them. The process that ultimately led to the Reformations of the sixteenth century can be viewed initially in the context of internal reform. As Daniel Trocmé-Latter points out, the criticisms of sixteenth-century reformers such as Luther and Bucer—whose 1 2\n\nFor fifteenth-century debates, see especially Rob C. Wegman, The Crisis of Music in Early Modern Europe, 1470–1530 (New York: Routledge, 2005). See Helmut Hucke, “Das Dekret Docta sanctorum patrum Papst Johannes’ XXII”, Musica disciplina 38 (1983): 119–31; Franz Körndle, “Die Bulle Docta sanctorum patrum. Überlieferung, Textgestalt und Wirkung”, Die Musikforschung 63 (2010): 147–65.\n\n26\n\nMusic, Theology, and the European Reformations\n\noriginality and international reach Trocmé-Latter rightly emphasises—built upon criticisms made earlier by Hus, Wycliffe, and Savonarola. The Lutheran Reformation, perhaps the most thoroughgoing to that point, began within the scholarly community of university theologians in Germany. From there, the call for reform spread into the hierarchy of the church, learned sodalities, groups of interested urban craftsmen, and agricultural workers. In each context, this call was heard in different ways, and the variety of responses sometimes led to strikingly different results. And as Trocmé-Latter observes, all reformers, whatever standpoint they ultimately adopted, considered music a central point of concern, whether of suspicion, or as a valuable tool of salvation. Church reform, both internal and external, was characterised by twin desires: to restore elements of the Christian tradition considered ruined by the passage of time, and to preserve what was still good. Displaying a developed sense of historical distance and an understanding of the evolution of Christian doctrine, Wycliffe appreciated that the liturgies of the Church had developed over time, often under the guiding hand of popes and theologians. For conservative Catholics and breakaway Protestants alike, the heritage of the past played a crucial role in constructing a new future, ostensibly the restoration of a lost, formerly pristine state, but often in practice the creation of something new: a Christian past made in the image of a given reformer, which rejected some elements and retained others. Among the clearest manifestations of the desire to return to the most ancient expressions of Christian belief was the revival of interest in the Sibylline prophecies. The Sibyls were widely believed during the Middle Ages to have predicted the birth of Christ, but in fact the “prophecies” dated from the early centuries of Christianity, and drew on earlier Roman beliefs about these prophetic women. At some time in the late Middle Ages, an unknown poet wrote a new series of Sibylline verses, which were transmitted in print from the second decade of the sixteenth century. Orlandus Lassus set these verses, in which the Sibyls were enrolled to demonstrate the truth of Jesus’s divinity, to music in about 1558, while he was working at the court of ­A lbrecht V of ­Bavaria. In Johannes Herold’s Orthodoxographa, Lassus’s source, the Sibyls are presented as exponents of a Christianity that focussed on Christ’s salvific work and, significantly, emphasised the important role of Mary. Contrasting with earlier readings\n\n27\n\nDavid J. Burn and Grantley McDonald\n\nof Lassus’s Prophetiae sibyllarum, Henk Jan de Jonge argues that these settings reflect Duke Albrecht’s desire to promote Counter-Reformation Catholicism in the face of “aberrant” Protestant beliefs. Marie-Alexis Colin shows that in France, the Sibylline prophecies could be used not just for spiritual but also for political ends. Most Christian groups, both Catholic and Evangelical, considered the primitive church, its theology, and its rites, an ideal from which later developments inevitably fell away. For Luther this entailed removing medieval “accretions” to the liturgy such as parts of the mass that reflected a medieval understanding of the Eucharist as a sacrifice. Luther also removed many sequences, especially those which seemed to glorify the saints to the point of idolatry. This same atavistic impulse conditioned the way that many Christian thinkers reacted to music. In at least one case, that of David Chytraeus, discussed by Inga Mai Groote, it even led to the desire to endow music with a history. Some reformers called for the preservation of the oldest music they knew, Gregorian chant. Some pointed out that the music of the earliest Christian worship services was sung in the language spoken by those who performed it, and was a kind of active prayer. Consequently, they argued that modern church music ought to be just as accessible to their contemporaries. More radical reformers, such as Zwinglians, Anabaptists, and Calvinists, took this putative restoration of ancient Christian liturgies even further, in some cases rejecting liturgical music entirely, or limiting it to the singing of the songs of the Jewish Temple and the earliest Christians, that is, the Psalms, translating them into modern languages and metres, and often interlarding their translations with theological commentary congenial to their hearers. With this Swiss development, which took time to crystallize, as Beat Föllmi shows, it was hoped that the singing typically practised in the Roman church, characterised—or caricatured—as mindless babbling, would be replaced by the sincere song of the simple believer, whether ordained or lay. This hope, aired first by late-medieval reformers, was picked up by their sixteenth-century followers, in explicit reliance on the writings of early church fathers. To make the attack all the more complete, critics of the music of the old Church carped that polyphony not merely rendered the words unintelligible; the voices of individual singers within a polyphonic texture often resembled more closely those of beasts than those of humans, as illustrated satirically in a woodcut by Leonhard Beck (Fig. 1).\n\n28\n\nMusic, Theology, and the European Reformations\n\nFig. 1. Leonhard Beck, The Singing Cow and the Lute-Playing Goat (Augsburg, c. 1523) Zürich, Zentralbibliothek, PAS II 25/13\n\nAncient theories of musical ethos resonated with reformers’ attempts to link music and prayer. Indeed, the promotion of ancient models, and the attempt to return to them are fundamentally linked. For Luther, these ancient tropes legitimized the wholesale embrace of music in all its diversity as one of the Church’s most precious ornaments, as Miikka Anttila argues. The same beliefs in music’s power to affect the soul of the listener led to its use as a tool for conversion and recruitment, as Mattias Lundberg’s examples of ostiatim singing demonstrate. Equally, music could console or express communal solidarity: as Luther put it in his unfinished treatise on music’s effects, music delights the soul and chases away the Devil.3 This function of music— which it still regularly fulfils—was particularly important for those who found them3\n\nSee Robin Leaver, “Luther on Music”, in The Pastoral Luther: Essays on Martin Luther’s Practical Theology, ed. Timothy J. Wengert (Grand Rapids MI: Eerdmans, 2009), 271–91.\n\n29\n\nDavid J. Burn and Grantley McDonald\n\nselves in places where their own religious beliefs conflicted with the dominant confession. The tactics and strategies employed in such instances, discussed by Elisabeth Giselbrecht in relation to the Frankfurt publisher Nikolaus Stein, and by the present writers in relation to the composer-schoolmaster Leonhard Paminger, can readily be set alongside similar examples that already have a place in the literature, most notably Ludwig Senfl and William Byrd.4 More radical reformers understood these same tropes about ancient music differently. Yet not even the most radical reformers rejected music entirely. Even the most extreme gave music a place somewhere, even if it was only in the home. Though such restrictions have often been cast negatively, in fact they betray an acknowledgment of the immense power of music to sway the affects. In such contexts, as set out by Hyun-Ah Kim, the comprehensibility of texts sung in church and participation became paramount. Given that the nature and function of faith was so contested during the Reformations, it is hardly surprising that the nature and function of music was also the object of sharply divided opinions, not just between the various confessions, but also within them. Just as the Reformations should be understood in the plural, so too were opinions about music within confessional groups far from monolithic or uniform. The examples presented by Andrew Cichy and Gioia Filocamo demonstrate the considerable variation within the Catholic Church. Furthermore, the implementation of reform could differ from region to region. For example, Nils Holger Petersen shows not only that the Danish Reformation in some respects preserved more of the medieval liturgy than did Luther, but also that, within Denmark, there was much variation between town and countryside. Equally, Luther’s views evolved over time, as did those of his contemporaries. This is strikingly exemplified by evolving Lutheran attitudes towards the role of the organ, as Sarah Davies shows: from an originally hostile position, the organ became not only a sonic, but also a visual and architectural symbol of Lutheranism par excellence. 4\n\nSee for example Craig Monson, “Byrd, the Catholics, and the Motet: The Hearing Reopened”, in Hearing the Motet, ed. Dolores Pesce (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1997), 348–74; Grantley McDonald, “The Metrical Harmoniae of Wolfgang Gräfinger and Ludwig Senfl in the Context of Humanism, Neoplatonism, and Nicodemism”, in Senfl-Studien I, ed. Stefan Gasch, Birgit Lodes, and Sonja Tröster (Tutzing: Schneider, 2012), 69–148; idem, “The Life and Trials of Lutheran Musicians at the Courts of Wilhelm IV and Ludwig X of Bavaria”, in Senfl-Studien II, ed. Stefan Gasch, Birgit Lodes, and Sonja Tröster (Tutzing: Schneider, 2013), 23–41.\n\n30\n\nMusic, Theology, and the European Reformations\n\nProtestant reformers are often seen as diametrically opposed both among themselves, and as a group in relation to the Roman Church. Yet the fact that reformers of all stripes borrowed a good deal from the past, and that the Roman Catholic Church and the reformers shared some goals, meant that there was actually much common ground between the confessions, more indeed than some may have been willing to admit. For example, as Alanna Ropchock Tierno persuasively argues, Luther’s removal of the sacrificial elements of mass did not stop Lutherans from continuing to sing ­Josquin’s mass based on the familiar Eucharistic hymn Pange lingua, closely associated with Thomas Aquinas’s order of vespers for the feast of Corpus Christi. Just as the Reformation’s links with the past are sometimes overlooked, so too is the reaction of the Roman church against the Protestant Reformation at the Council of Trent sometimes exaggerated. Although Tridentine pronouncements in relation to music were limited, they nonetheless agree in some respects with the aesthetic and spiritual aims of reformers.5 The famous Tridentine injunction to clear text-setting overlaps with similar reformist concerns that the words of the liturgy be comprehensible. Catholics also shared with reformers the desire to return to a (fictional) pristine state. Many Catholics also criticised the music of the Middle Ages, and the institutions in which it was born, practised, and preserved, as morally corrupt, perverting music from a worthy form of prayer into a means of profit. Just as Luther stripped away medieval accretions to the liturgy such as sequences and tropes, so too were most removed from the new Tridentine liturgy. Some Catholics even criticised the late medieval liturgy as musically corrupt. The infamous “Medicean” revision of Gregorian chant is simply an extreme example of the desire to restore a tradition believed lost. Like the Evangelical reformers, Catholics too re-evaluated music’s ethical qualities, as Xavier Bisaro shows in his consideration of the casuistic tradition, rarely addressed by musicologists. For all the dominance of theology and confession in the sixteenth century, other factors, such as politics or aesthetic considerations, could sometimes override the spiritual. Alternatively, spiritual and theological tools could be employed for secular ends such as courtly representation of power and prestige. The examples discussed by 5\n\nCraig A. Monson, “The Council of Trent Revisited”, Journal of the American Musicological Society 55 (2002): 1–37.\n\n31\n\nDavid J. Burn and Grantley McDonald\n\nThomas Schmidt in this respect, though extreme, suggest a more general situation that must also have prevailed elsewhere. Frank Dobbins even argues that music could nonetheless retain its own autonomy, however embedded in theological concerns it might be, and even if composed by a priest. Debates concerning the role of music in the service of religion continued even after the Reformation, when they were often strongly coloured by changing perceptions of those religio-political events. In the closing chapter of this book, Peter Malisse draws parallels between the ways in which the Reformations reshaped fictional pasts into new futures, and the ways in which the Reformations were reshaped and reimagined according to the sensitivities and blind-spots of subsequent ages. Most recently, the Second Vatican Council once again overhauled ecclesiastical musical practices drastically and controversially, supported by theological arguments in terms that resonate strikingly in some respects with arguments put forward by sixteenth-century reformers. The study of music and theology is thus not only of historical interest, but also of direct contemporary relevance, a discourse to which new contributions are continually being added. Acknowledgements and dedication\n\nEarly versions of the chapters in the present volume were presented at a conference entitled Music, Theology, and the European Reformations, held at the University of Leuven in September 2012, co-organised by the department of musicology and the faculty of theology. We acknowledge the support of the Research Foundation Flanders (FWO) for a grant to offset the conference costs. The conference took place within the framework of a project entitled Music and Theology in Reformation Germany: The Case of Leonhard Paminger, supported by the KU Leuven Special Research Fund. David J. Burn led this project, and Grantley McDonald worked on it as postdoctoral researcher. We dedicate this collection to the memory of our friend and colleague Frank Dobbins (1943–2012), whose presentation at the 2012 conference turned out to be his last formal musicological engagement: shortly after, he unexpectedly suffered a fatal heart attack. We were also deeply saddened to learn of the death of Xavier Bisaro, at the tragically early age of forty-six, while this book was in its final stages.\n\n32\n\nMedieval Heritage\n\n1 Music, Heretics, and Reformers Daniel Trocmé-Latter\n\nJesus Christus nostra salus\n\nJesus Christus unser Heiland\n\nquod reclamat omnis malus,\n\nder von uns den Gottes Zorn wand,\n\nnobis sui memoriam\n\ndurch das bitter Leiden sein\n\ndedit in panis hostiam.\n\nhalf er uns aus der Höllen Pein.\n\nT\n\nhis hymn,attributed to the Bohemian priest Jan Hus (c.1369–1415),1 was\n\nappropriated by Martin Luther for his sixteenth-century reforms. Luther considered it to be a suitable hymn to be sung after the consecration of the bread, before the blessing of the wine, alongside, or instead of, the Sanctus, and translated it for that purpose.2 It is a well-known fact that Luther made use of pre-existing texts when creating his corpus of Reformation hymnody. But the use of this hymn has a further significance: it is symbolic of the importance attributed to earlier “heretical” preachers such as Jan Hus by the sixteenth-century reformers. Historically, this has been well acknowledged.3 What has not been emphasised, however, is the degree of similarity between the ways late medieval preachers and sixteenth-century reformers considered music’s role in church and its relevance to the faith of their congregations.\n\n1 2 3\n\nThe ascription is partly due to the presence of the acrostic J-O-H-A-N-N-E-S throughout the first eight stanzas; see Thomas A.

Second, rather than attempting to draw a line of direct influence between these preachers and the reformers, I will frame these men within the context of the sixteenth-century Reformation period and the Protestant reformers’ interest in them, considering points of contrast and similarity between the prevalent views on music of that period. Three heretics\n\nIn 1531, Luther rather unashamedly proclaimed that his reformation had been foretold 116 years earlier: Holy Johannes Hus prophesied about me when he wrote from his Bohemian prison that they might now be roasting a goose (for Hus means goose), but in a hundred years they will hear a swan sing, which they will not be able to silence.4\n\nHus had himself been greatly influenced by the fourteenth-century English preacher John Wycliffe (c. 1324–84). Believing strongly in the importance of the vernacular in church, and placing great emphasis on Scripture, Wycliffe ran into trouble with the ecclesiastical authorities, both in England and in Rome, and some of his works were pronounced heretical during his lifetime. Despite this, he managed to avoid execution, eventually dying of natural causes.5 Thereafter, his writings and beliefs were propagated by the Lollards in England and by Hus and his followers in Bohemia. Both Wycliffe and Hus were branded heretics at the Council of Constance in 1415. Wycliffe\n\n4\n\n5\n\n“Sanct Johannes Hus hat von mir geweissagt, da er aus dem gefegnis jnn Behemerland schreib, Sie werden jtzt eine gans braten (denn Hus heisst eine gans,) Aber uber hundert jaren werden sie einen schwanen singen hoͤ ren, Den sollen sie leiden. Da sols auch bey bleiben, ob Gott wil”. WA, vol. 30.III: 387 (see also n. 2); translated in Heiko A. Oberman, Luther: Man between God and the Devil (New Haven: Yale University Press, 1989), 55.

Levy (ed.), A Com­ panion to John Wyclif: Late Medieval Theologian (Leiden: Brill, 2011), both provide bibliographical information on the fourteenth-century preacher. Thomas A. Fudge has published a great deal in recent years on Jan Hus, including The Magnificent Ride: The First Reformation in Hussite Bohemia (Aldershot: Ashgate, 1998); The Memory and Motivation of Jan Hus (Turnhout: Brepols, 2013); and Jan Hus Between Time and Eternity: Reconsidering a Medieval Heretic (Lanham: Lexington Books, 2016).\n\n36\n\nMusic, Heretics, and Reformers\n\nwas condemned posthumously, of course, but Hus was not so fortunate, and was burnt at the stake for his crimes against the Church. Both figures were influential in shaping the ideas of the Protestant Reformation a century later. On matters concerning, for example, the physical nature of the Eucharist, the authority and infallibility of the pope and the Church, and the importance of preaching to congregations, the ideas of Hus and Wycliffe were taken up again during the religious strife of the sixteenth century (see Fig. 1). Lollardy, the movement that followed Wycliffe, enjoyed a minor revival in England during the Reformation, but not so much abroad. Both Martin Luther and Philipp Melanchthon seem to have been familiar with the preacher’s writings to some extent. They referred to Wycliffe’s errors in doctrine,6 even if Luther implicitly approved of Wycliffite theology by endorsing Jan Hus, who in contrast became something of a martyr for the German Reformation.7 After Hus’s death, his followers formed the Bohemian Brethren, a movement which had a significant impact on the Reformation and which has influenced some modern-day religious groups as well. Hus’s works began to be printed relatively early. His first attributed publication was printed around 1472 in Speyer,8 but his works were also published in all the major print centres of Germany. Moreover, there was a significant surge in the printing of his works during the 1520s and 1530s.9 The Lollards were a significant force in England during the first half of the 1400s, but their importance diminished during the latter half of the century. Wycliffe’s works did not begin being printed until the 1540s, well after the Reformation had begun.10 In fact these 6\n\n7\n\n8 9 10\n\nSee Margaret Aston, Lollards and Reformers: Images and Literacy in Late Medieval Religion (London: Hambledon, 1984), 259, citing Robert Parsons, a Jesuit who referred to these acknowledged errors in A Treatise of Three Conuersions of England from Paganisme to Christian Religion, 3 vols (Saint-Omer: Bellet, 1603–04), vol. 2: 186–89.

We can reasonably assume, though, that such writings were in circulation in manuscript immediately before and during the first few decades of the Reformation.11 After the death of Hus in 1415, strands of heretical leanings continued to emerge, and heterodoxy remained a problem for the Roman Church throughout the fifteenth century (and, of course, beyond). Girolamo Savonarola (1452–98), active in Florence at the end of the fifteenth century, also received posthumous sympathy from the sixteenth-century reformers on many matters. During his life, Savonarola had been heavily critical of the singing of religious communities, both in terms of the quality of their singing and their reasons for doing it.12 He wrote laude—simple spiritual songs for the common people to sing—and urged the clergy to reform their ways (musical and otherwise). Savonarola was excommunicated by Pope Alexander VI in 1497 for defying a preaching ban, and was condemned, hanged, and burnt in 1498. His texts were printed from 1489 onwards, and after his execution he was venerated by his followers (known as the piagnoni, or “weepers”), who kept his memory alive well into the sixteenth century. His works were published in several German cities during the sixteenth century.13 Much attention has been paid to the visual aspect of pre-Reformation heretical church life. However, issues of sound have, for the most part, not been approached\n\n11\n\n12 13\n\nAn Historical Account of the Origin and Progress of Printing in Great Britain and Ireland, ed.

Consider, for example, the case of Wycliffe’s Wicket, a Lollard tract discovered in the possession of several people between 1510 and 1521. See Aston, Lollards and Reformers, 232. Many of Wycliffe’s works were not printed until the late nineteenth or early twentieth century, when they were published by the Wyclif Society. Rob Wegman frames Savonarola’s views within the context of a wider continental attack on polyphony at the end of the fifteenth century. See Rob C. Wegman, The Crisis of Music in Early Modern Europe, 1470–1530 (New York and London: Routledge, 2005).

References to ecclesiastical music practice by these two men are relatively rare. This is mainly because both these theologians considered music primarily as an enhancement to worship, not as a pressing issue in need of reform. Moreover, unlike the sixteenth-century reformers, they were not attempting to reform the liturgy. For Luther, however, who famously said that “except for theology there is no art that could be put on the same level with music”,15 song and religion were inextricably bound. Christianity could not be reformed without the use of the vernacular or the use of the art of music. His reforms ensured that the people were given vernacular songs to sing, even if the choir continued to sing in Latin. Other figures, such as Martin Bucer, reformer in Strasbourg at the beginning of the Reformation, also introduced congregational songs, but went further than Luther by abolishing professional choral singing, and indicating a preference for the term “Lord’s supper” (“das Herrn Nachtmahl”) over “mass”.16 However, the concern of Wycliffe and Hus for matters such as the vernacular, the importance of sincerity, and the commercialisation and well-being of the Church can be connected firmly to their interest in the way music was used in ecclesiastical contexts. Services in a large church or cathedral in late medieval times would have provided the congregation with little, if any, opportunity to sing. The choir sang in 14\n\n15 16\n\nRichard Rex glosses over “liturgical performance” without even a mention of music in The Lollards (Basingstoke: Palgrave, 2002), 13–14. Arthur G. Dickens, in his tome on Lollardy in sixteenth-century York, devotes a single paragraph to liturgical music, citing a document from 1552 (Dickens, Lollards and Protes­ tants in the Diocese of York, 1509–1558 [London: Oxford University Press, 1959], 202–03). Eamon Duffy’s monumental The Stripping of the Altars (New Haven: Yale University Press, 1992) mentions liturgical singing a number of times, but usually only acknowledging its occurrence, rather than considering its broader function. Defying this dearth of literature on music among the heresies is Bruce W. Holsinger, “The Vision of Music in a Lollard Florilegium: Cantus in the Middle English Rosarium theologie (Cambridge, Gonville and Caius College MS 354/581)”, Plainsong and Medieval Music 8 (1999): 95–106, which calls for the need to re-evaluate the commentaries of the Lollards in this light. That article, however, examines just one document. Wegman’s Crisis of Music also cites some Lollard and Hussite texts. “Et plane iudico, nec pudet asserere, post theologiam esse nullam artem, quae musicae possit aequari”. WA Br, vol. 5: 639; LW, vol. 49: 428. See also Walter E. Buszin, “Luther on Music”, Musical Quarterly 32 (1946): 84. It is worth noting, though, that Bucer in fact defended the term “mass” on at least one occasion, citing the actions of the “massing priests” (“sacrificuli”) as the problem rather than the liturgy itself. For Bucer’s particular stance on the mass, see Nick Thompson, “Introduction”, in Martin Bucer, De vera et falsa cae­ nae dominicae administratione (1546), ed. Nick Thompson (Leiden and Boston: Brill, 2014), 38–39.\n\n40\n\nMusic, Heretics, and Reformers\n\nLatin: plainchant, polyphony, or a combination. The singers were often paid according to the work they undertook, something which irritated many churchmen over the centuries.17 Masses were often sung for the dead, paid for by the families of the deceased, or through income from endowments. It was no doubt partly the prevalance of such practices that led to the drastic liturgical reforms of the beginning of the Reformation. During the 1520s, many areas of Germany, for example, restructured or even abolished the Latin mass, and this would have led to changes in the music of the divine rite.18 Choirs, if retained, would almost certainly have been told to sing in a fashion which was intelligible to the congregation, at least partially in the vernacular.19 Many towns also began producing vernacular songbooks for the laity so that they would be able, in theory, to sing. During the latter part of the sixteenth century, the congregational psalm became a trademark of Swiss-French reforms in particular and its derivatives in general, but also of martyrs throughout the continent, persecuted for their faith. While Latin polyphony continued to be the characteristic sound of the ­Roman Church, the psalms became the music of the Reformed Church, which were—or at least its proponents wished—sung with vigour, understanding, and sincerity. Music and the reformed liturgy\n\nChurch song must, in the context of this paper, be understood above all as a form of prayer. For Wycliffe, Hus, and Savonarola, as well as for the later reformers, the reform of music in church was based around identifying the most appropriate way for the congregation to pray to, and praise, God. All the most prominent sixteenth-century reformers (with the exception, perhaps, of Huldrych Zwingli20) firmly believed that 17 18 19 20\n\nOn Strasbourg, for example, see Daniel Trocmé-Latter, The Singing of the Strasbourg Protestants, 1523– 1541 (Farnham: Ashgate, 2015; repr. Routledge: Abingdon, 2016). For a broad overview of changes to music in the liturgy in Reformation Germany, see Joseph Herl, Wor­ ship Wars in Early Lutheranism: Choir, Congregation, and Three Centuries of Conflict (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2004). Latin choral music survived in many areas, though. For example, see Heinrich Kätzel, Musikpflege und Musikerziehung im Reformationsjahrhundert dargestellt am Beispiel der Stadt Hof (Göttingen: Vandenhoeck & Ruprecht, 1957), esp. 109–34. On this matter see Kenneth H. Marcus, “Hymnody and Hymnals in Basel, 1526–1606”, The Sixteenth Century Journal 32 (2001): 729; and Markus Jenny, Luther, Zwingli, Calvin in ihren Liedern (Zurich: Theologischer Verlag, 1983), esp. 175.\n\n41\n\nDaniel Trocmé-Latter\n\nmusic should occupy a central position in worship, although they held differing opinions on its use and the extent of its application. They also viewed liturgical practices (including those which involved music) as having strayed so far from the intentions of the early Church as to be almost unrecognisable. By the middle of the fifteenth century, polyphonic settings of the mass ordinary had become commonplace, and other elements of the liturgy were also often set polyphonically, including introits, graduals, and motets. The sixteenth-century reformers, therefore, inherited an ever-flourishing tradition of choral music, but one which they did not consider fit for use in common worship. Church music, they felt, had become too elaborate, and often concealed the text. Furthermore, the Latin language was not comprehensible to the common people, and there was usually no room for congregational participation, as choirs usually sang on behalf of the people.21 The reformers generally considered that previous recommendations by church councils had been ignored, and argued that radical change was needed. Polyphony thereby became one of the most controversial aspects of the sixteenth-century reforms.22 Perceptions about church music during the Reformation are too often polarised into “for” and “against” categories, with Luther traditionally being considered the saviour of church music and Jean Calvin and Huldrych Zwingli being depicted as the epitome—and origin—of Puritan musical hostility. Meanwhile, figures such as the Strasbourg reformer Martin Bucer, who wrote a great deal about the role of music in church, are often overlooked. The reality, of course, involved a great deal more depth 21\n\n22\n\nSee Johannes Janota, Studien zu Funktion und Typus des deutschen geistlichen Liedes im Mittelalter (Munich: Beck, 1968). See also René Bornert, La Réforme protestante du culte à Strasbourg au xvie siècle (1523–1598) (Leiden: Brill, 1981), 472–73; Andrew Pettegree, Reformation and the Culture of Persuasion (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2005), 42. Congregations only sang on special occasions such as some feast days (see the elaborate description of pre-Reformation processions during Holy Week and Easter in Alexandre Straub, Geschichtskalender des Hochstiftes und des Münsters von Strassburg [Rixheim: Sutter, 1891], 69–70). For example, the Council of Basel in 1503 addressed the issue of early curtailment of, and the use of secular melodies in, the Nicene Creed (see section entitled “Symbolum finiatur absque melodia validorum Mendicantum”, in Johann Friedrich Schannat et al. [eds], Concilia Germaniae, 11 vols [Cologne: Kracamp & Simon, 1759–90], vol. 6: 21), and the Council of Salzburg (1490) and Synod of Schwerin (1492) had discussed the matter of intelligibility of sung texts (see Giovan Domenico Mansi et al. [eds], Sacrorum Con­ ciliorum nova et amplissima collectio, 34 vols [Florence and Venice: Zatta, 1759–98], vol. 32: cols 510–11; Schannat, Concilia Germaniae, vol. 5: 655; see also Karl Gustav Fellerer, “Church Music and the Council of Trent”, trans. Moses Hadas, in The Musical Quarterly 39 [1953]: 578).\n\n42\n\nMusic, Heretics, and Reformers\n\nand nuance. Individual reformers each had their own agenda, and, depending on factors such as the extent of their own musical education, and their experiences of the use—or abuse—of music in church, began the Reformation with their own idealistic liturgical scenarios. Just as each reformer had a unique vision for the future of Christendom, each understood the role of music within the Church differently. In both Wittenberg and Strasbourg, music was on the agenda from the dawn of the Reformation. Bucer and his colleagues spoke in depth of the role of music in church in lengthy tracts published in 1523 and 1524.23 Luther strongly believed that the prophets and church fathers desired that the Word of God be sung to music, and both Bucer in Strasbourg and Calvin in Geneva also adopted this philosophy.24 For these reformers, God came to the people whenever the Scriptures were spoken or sung in an intelligible manner. Congregational singing therefore conformed to the Biblical ideal, but what was sung also had to have a scriptural basis, and be in the vernacular.25 Choirs and clergy should no longer be allowed to sing on behalf of the laity. The reformers also complained about payments made to the clergy in return for sung masses or vigils, which they interpreted as a form of simony. The reformers’ scepticism about the existence of purgatory led them to suggest not only that payments for singing were corrupt, but that the singing was ineffectual. Music was therefore no longer to be misappropriated in this way. Whereas Wittenberg was—and still is—considered the centre of Reformation theology, a number of important developments took place in Strasbourg. Martin Bucer was a networker, and the reforms in Strasbourg were influential elsewhere.26 Matthäus Zell, Christeliche verantwortung M.

Second, the church order for Ulm was compiled by Bucer at the request of the Ulm authorities. It stipulates that the aim of church singing is to emulate the singing of Christians since ancient times, and\n\n23\n\n43\n\nDaniel Trocmé-Latter\n\nThe city also had a major printing industry, and there were several publishers in the city who produced books with musical notation. In 1524, Bucer and his colleague Wolfgang Capito wrote to Luther and the Swiss reformers to explain that the city of Strasbourg was introducing congregational singing into its churches. In the letters, they announced that “the whole church” (“ecclesia tota”) should sing not only the psalms but also the Kyrie, the Gloria, and Credo.27 This demonstrates that Bucer was keen to follow his own liturgical programme while at the same time keeping abreast of developments in other centres of reform. Changes to the mass over time\n\nMusic is mentioned rarely in Wycliffite and Hussite texts, but when it is discussed in a contemporary context, writers strongly criticise its appropriation. The reformers and the pre-Reformation preachers shared a common belief in the need to restore the Church to an earlier state, purer and closer to the requirements of Christ. Without a detailed knowledge of the musical practice of the early Church, however, they could propose little under a pretext of authenticity.28 But Wycliffe and others were aware that the liturgy of the mass no longer resembled the form used in the earliest days of Christianity, and they therefore paid it considerable attention in their writings. John Wycliffe’s only serious proposal for change in the liturgy was in the treatise De apostasia, in which he opined that the gatherings of Christ and the apostles were “more perfect” than services of his own time.29 He complained that the Roman Church\n\n27 28\n\n29\n\nexplains how this might be achieved. For more details, see Trocmé-Latter, The Singing of the Strasbourg Protestants, 218–39. Letters to the preachers of Basel and Zurich (November 1524) and to Luther (November 1524). Correspon­ dance de Martin Bucer, ed. Jean Rott et al., 5 vols (Leiden: Brill, 1979–), vol. 1: 285–86 and 293. Biblical passages such as Ephesians 5:18–19 (“Be filled with the Spirit, speaking to one another with psalms, hymns, and songs from the Spirit. Sing and make music from your heart to the Lord”) provided advocates of congregational singing with a convincing argument in its favour. The sixteenth-century reformers gave this more thought than their predecessors, and used historical references to such practice. Bucer, for example, referred to a letter by the Roman governor Pliny the Younger which described the singing of an early covert Christian congregation. See BDS, vol. 1: 276. Pliny’s letter is reproduced in Joseph B. Lightfoot (ed.), The Apostolic Fathers, 5 vols (London: Macmillan, 1889), vol. 1: 50–54. “Igitur religio illa primeva a qua ceciderant fuit sequente perfeccior”. Wycliffe, Tractatus de apostasia, ed.

From this institution of the psalms came introits, graduals, offertories, communion hymns […] to be sung at masses in the Roman Church. Gregory composed sixty-five antiphons, ordered the singing of the Kyrie by the priest at the mass—since it was being sung in the Greek Church by all the people—made the Alleluia to be said outside of Pentecost, and added three phrases to the canon of the Host [i.e., the consecration] […] He also decided the Sunday prayer should be read over the host after the canon [of the mass]. Symmachus the fifty-third [pope] decided that the Gloria should be sung every Sunday and on the feast days of martyrs; which hymn Pope Celestine Telesphorus, the ninth after Peter, himself designated to be sung on the Christmas night […]. Damasus the thirty-sixth [pope] instituted the singing of the Credo […]. Sixtus, the seventh [pope], instituted the singing of the Sanctus; Sergius, the eightieth, lastly instituted that the Agnus Dei be chanted by the clergy.34\n\n30 Wycliffe, Tractatus de apostasia, 236. 31 Wycliffe, Tractatus de apostasia, 237. 32 Wycliffe, Tractatus de apostasia, 239. 33 Marie-Hélène Jullien and Françoise Perelman (eds), Clavis Scriptorum Latinorum Medii Aevi.

The text was previously ascribed to Alcuin of York (c. 735–804). 34 “Celestinus papa 42us constituerat ut psalmi David centum 50 ante sacrificium canerentur anthiphonatim ex omnibus; quod ante non fiebat, sed tantum epistola et ewangelium recitabantur. Ex hoc instituto excepti de psalmis introitus, gradualia, offertoria, communione cum modulacione ad missam in ecclesia Romana cantari ceperunt. Gregorius 65 antiphonarium regulariter centonisavit et compilavit, Kyrieleison a clero ad missam cantari precepit, quod aput Grecos ab omni populo cantabatur; alleluya extra penthecosten ad missam dici fecit, in canone tria verba superadidit hostie […].

In contrast to Wycliffe, who preferred to do without such innovations, ­Luther retained all these additions to the mass, except the canon and a large number of sequences. Although Luther showed concern over the historical modifications of others, he believed that the majority were worthwhile. The mass, he wrote, “is a rite divinely instituted by Christ himself […] [I]t was observed first by Christ and then by the apostles, quite simply and evangelically without any additions.”37 He continued furthermore that figures like Athanasius and Cyprian were to be commended for including the reading of psalms before communion. The Kyrie was also a worthy addition to the rite. However, […] in the course of time so many human inventions were added to it that nothing except the names of the mass and communion has come down to us. […] Later, when chanting began, the psalms were changed into the introit; the Angelic Hymn Gloria in Excelsis: et in terra pax, the graduals, the Alleluias, the Nicene Creed, the Sanctus, the Agnus Dei, and the communio were added. All of these are unobjectionable […]. But when everyone felt free to add or change at will and when the tyranny of priestly greed and pride entered in, then our wicked kings, i.e., the bishops and pastors, began to erect those altars to the images of Baal and all gods in the Lord’s temple […]. What I am speaking of is the canon […]. The mass became a sacrifice.38 35\n\n“Non quidem sanccius hinc est quod erat prius, cum ad sola verba Domini solamque dominicam oracionem consecrabatur.

The pamphlet, Das die papistischen opffermessen abzuthun, was probably not authorised by church officials in the city, and even takes quite an antimusical stance. Song is depicted as a waste of time, rather than something which needs reforming, a statement which suggests that its author held Zwinglian sympathies. Furthermore, it explains that certain individual elements of the liturgy did not originate with either Jesus or the apostles. Even the introit, “which originates from the customs of the first churches, has now been turned into a song, and helps to make the mass idolatrous, even though it was first useful when the Church began”.39 The author describes in even more detail than De divinis officiis how the other parts of the service originated with various popes throughout the ages.40 “In short”, the Strasbourg pamphlet states, “the Lord’s Supper has become a blasphemy.”41 The only remedy was the abolition of the mass. These three texts, from different places, all list the same sorts of changes, but disagree in their assessment of the predicted result of these changes. Of course, it is impossible to know whether one influenced any of the others. Either De divinis officiis or Wycliffe’s tract could have served as the source for the sixteenth-century texts, but similar texts may likewise have circulated. It would seem that Zwingli, or at least Zwinglian theology, influenced the attitudes of the author of the Strasbourg polemic towards the evolution of the liturgy of the mass. Wycliffe’s De apostasia was only available in manuscript sources or secondary citations. Regardless, it is fascinating to see how Luther and Wycliffe adopt similar approaches. Both have their particular preferences, and both are keen to prove their points by demonstrating how unauthentic these various aspects of the mass were. In fact, despite Luther’s apparent keenness to retain the basic form of the Roman mass, he was also conscious that although many impios reges nostros, id est, Episcopos et pastores […] loquor autem de Canone […] ibi cepit missa fieri sacrificum”.

These included organs, hymns to Mary, and, in Lent, the singing of psalms at the graveside, and “the use of clappers instead of the ringing of bells” (“Nicht leuten, Aber klappern”).42 Understanding and sincerity\n\nWycliffe, like Hus, Savonarola, and the many reformers who followed them, firmly believed in the importance of the vernacular. He claimed that those who failed to preach the Gospel in the language of the people refused to do so through fear of exposing the deceitfulness of their own lives. He criticised the fact that they willingly translated the Seven Deadly Sins and the Ten Commandments into English, but never preached or celebrated the liturgy in English.43 But, he countered, “If the soul is not in tune with the words, how can the words have power? If thou hast no love, thou art sounding brass and a tinkling cymbal”.44 Wycliffe’s emphasis on Holy Scripture was another distinctive feature of his writing. He believed that the ceremonies of the Church should be founded in Scripture.45 Bishops and monks expressed “horror” at the thought of translating the Gospel into English or preaching it to the people, an attitude which excluded ordinary people from the kingdom of heaven.46 Wycliffe also observed the importance of sincerity in prayer. To praise God in word was no use if one then blasphemed him in deed.47 As observed by Thomas Fudge, Jan Hus’s commitment to liturgical reform can be (and has been) overstated.48 However, Hus did express his appreciation for the 42 WA, vol. 30.II: 349–50. 43 Wycliffe, Polemical Works in Latin, ed.

But Hus’s writings on hymns, rather than the hymns themselves, reveal similarities with the sixteenth-century reformers. “A nun who repeats a prayer mechanically, without inner feeling, is like a magpie that is taught to say the words of a prayer”, he stated in his Výklad na Páteř (Interpretation of the Lord’s Prayer).51 Luther complained, in even stronger terms, that “even though a monk may have been reading or muttering [the office] for forty years, he has not prayed from his heart for a single hour during all those years.”52 Both theologians insisted that praying after the fashion of a parrot (or magpie) was ineffectual. Similarly, Savonarola, in a sermon on 25 February 1498, objected to the “lukewarm” (“tepidi”) who prayed only with their mouths, and not with their hearts: These lukewarm ones have a mouth and do not speak, but they howl and bark, murmur and speak ill, they flatter the great lords and do not tell them the truth […]. O lukewarm ones, this is not the way; if you want to win, and you believe that God is not with us but with you, say your prayers and live a good life, and God will enlighten you and will make you overcome and uncover the truth. But you do not know how to pray, as the psalm says here,53 and you do not know how to speak.54\n\n49 50 51\n\n52 53 54\n\nEnrico C. S.

See Fudge, The Memory and Motivation of Jan Hus, 149. As mentioned above, Luther was particularly keen on one of Hus’s hymns, Jesus Christus unser Heiland. “Protož ač straka neb jiný pták řieká slova modlitebná, však v pravdě nemodlí sě; a varhany ač vznie, však sě nemodlé: a též i jeptišky, jenž štěbecí a nevědie co, jako straky”.

In 1523, Bucer complained that monks and nuns “claimed their singing and muttering, which they did not even understand, to be work; sleeping half the day was a vigil, and filling themselves up with fish was to fast […]. A Christian must make his vigil not as a monk says matins, getting up in the middle of the night and howling away for an hour or two”.56 Insulting the quality of singing of the clergy, or its lack of purpose and sincerity, was a popular polemical tool that Luther also used. In one of his lectures on Isaiah, he wrote that The Gospel attributes nothing of glory, praise, thanksgiving, and sacrifice to human powers but preaches and extols the divine grace alone. This is what “proclaiming praises within your gates”57 means. It does not mean the praises of the papist matins, which are a blaspheming and howling, but it means praising God alone, giving thanks to Him, and offering praise and glory to God alone.58\n\nDescriptions of the singing of Savonarola’s own songs contrast with such descriptions of the mentally numb prayer of monks and nuns. As an antidote to the excesses of Carnival in 1497, he organised a godly procession, during which many thousands of people, men and women alike, received communion from the hands of the servant of God [Savonarola], singing hymns and spiritual canticles in such a way that one might believe that the angels had come down to dwell with human beings, and so it certainly was […]. Around the infant Jesus were child cantors, who sang psalms and\n\ned. Anne E.

Hus, rather than providing examples of each, often simply suggested the manner in which singing in church should take place. Believing in the power of sung prayer, he wrote that “it behooves […] the priests and the acolytes to stand decently before the people, to pronounce the words clearly, and to wait carefully till the other side (in antiphonal sections) has finished singing or reading, so as to enable both the learned and the simple folk to enjoy hearing and understanding, with reason”.60 The reformers agreed on the importance of singing in the spiritual life of the Christian. Hus conceived of this in terms of late medieval piety, writing that “prayer is oral genuflection, just as we genuflect and sing before the cross on which Christ suffered, or before the mourning veil of the Blessed Virgin Mary, or before other saints”.61 Although the sixteenth-century reformers were less keen on devotions to the saints, Bucer and Luther agreed with Hus concerning the importance of singing to God. Singing, when done properly, was an edifying experience for the good of the Church as an institution and as a community.

He frequently referred to hymns in relation to more general points. In one sermon, Wycliffe justified the inclusion of the Songs of Mary, Simeon, and Zechariah within the liturgy. The first canticle, the Magnificat,65 is used at vespers, he says, because Mary “was the source of redemption among all of us”, the second, the Nunc dimittis,66 at the end of compline “in order that, reaching the end of our pilgrimage [that is, our lives], we may be admitted to purgatory and heaven”. The third canticle is the Benedictus,67 the song of “old Zechariah, the ancient of days, who is the help of the Lord Jesus Christ, and he himself, since he is the beginning and the end, gives fulfilment to the Church in the morning” at lauds.68 These three canticle texts were, owing partly to their Biblical origins, amongst the few that survived the Reformation. The Magnificat formed the basis of the service of vespers, a service appropriated by a number of denominations at the Reformation. Liturgical orders for the revised Protestant service of matins in many parts of Germany made provision for the Benedictus (Song of Zechariah),69 borrowed from the service of lauds. In 1525 the same text was also recommended by Strasbourg’s committee for liturgical revision as a suitable canticle with which to end the service of the Lord’s 63 64 65 66 67 68\n\n69\n\n“durch welche dann unsere gemu tͤ er zů Got, unserem Scho pͤ ffer und Christo, unserem Heiland, und also zů aller zucht, erbarkeit, christlicher liebe und freuntschafft, durcheinander gelert underwisen, gereitzet und gezogen”.

Despite many reformers’ opposition to the cult of Mary, the Magnificat’s scriptural origin assured it a place in the new liturgy. The Nunc dimittis survived, despite the suppression of the office of compline, partly owing to its suitability as a funeral or memorial hymn. Even Calvin’s Geneva, with its extremely limited range of non-psalmic texts, embraced the Nunc dimittis from an early stage.71 The reference to the “rising sun” at the beginning of the Benedictus made it particularly suitable for morning worship, and its description of creation was no doubt deemed an appropriate text with which people could greet their daily life. In other words, many of the sixteenth-century reformers, Luther and Bucer among them, shared Wycliffe’s opinion of the worthiness of these canticles. Simony\n\nLike Wycliffe, Hus criticised not only the doctrine of the Eucharist, but also simoniacal practices. Both maintained that spiritual services were not to be—indeed, could not be—bought or sold as a commodity. It was impossible for people to gain influence over God by offering him temporal objects; nor could a priest affect another person’s chances of entering heaven by singing masses for them. Many late medieval and early modern preachers criticised the use of music as a tool in this business. Wycliffe complained in De simonia about the various fees charged by the Church: fees for benedictions of vestments, of the holy oils, for confirmation and ordination, fees to clerks, barbers, and other figures. It was not only immoral, but against the law of the Church, he said, for simoniacs to perform mass.72 This point was picked up by others, such as the early Lollard Walter Brute: 70 See BDS, vol. 2: 467 (text from Archives de la Ville et de l’Eurométropole de Strasbourg, 1 AST 80, 4, fol. 32v; 1 AST 166, 5.17, fol. 108r). German versions of the Songs of Zechariah (the Benedictus) and of Simeon (the Nunc dimittis) were published together in a Strasbourg pamphlet in 1527, Der siben vnd ­dreyssigst psalm Dauids (Strasbourg: Köpfel, [1527]) [vdm 345]. See Trocmé-Latter, The Singing of the Strasbourg Protestants, 87. 71 Calvin’s first psalter, Aulcuns pseaulmes et cantiques mys en chant (Strasbourg: Knobloch, 1539) [vdm 903], contained the Nunc Dimittis in French verse, but neither the Magnificat nor the Benedictus. 72 Wycliffe, De simonia, ed.
