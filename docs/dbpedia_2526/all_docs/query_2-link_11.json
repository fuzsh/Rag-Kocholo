        "text": "The prominent title is In Convertendo, a grand motet from Rameau’s early\n\nyears as a church organist; and the box is labeled Concert/Documentary. Things should be the\n\nother way around: this is in fact a DVD presenting an excellent documentary, The Real Rameau,\n\nwith In Convertendo and three movements from the Pièces de Clavecin en Concerts as lagniappe\n\n(Lousiana French for “a small gift thrown in free along with a purchase”).\n\nEven such figures as Handel, Bach, Vivaldi, and Telemann are not well-supplied with\n\ndocumentaries on their lives and works, so a presentation of Rameau, certainly the least\n\nwell-known of the great composers of the Baroque, is especially welcome. Rameau, who I like to\n\nthink of as Puccini to Lully’s Verdi, had the greatest second act in the history of music, making\n\nhis debut as opera composer in Paris at the age of 50 after decades in the provinces as an organist\n\n(imagine J.S. Bach moving to Italy in 1735 to write operas!). The documentary begins with a\n\ndramatized discussion of the great composer lifted from Denis Diderot’s Rameau’s Nephew (you can read the complete text here), and\n\nmoves through the course of Rameau’s career with the engaging William Christie as our guide,\n\nalong with musicologist Sylvie Boissou of the Institut de recherché sur le patrimoine musical en\n\nFrance, illustrated by clips from In Convertendo, the Pièces de Clavecin, and the operas (there\n\nare now four available complete on DVD – Les Indes Galantes, Platée, Les Paladin, and Les\n\nBoreades). Christie and Boissou do a fine job of explaining, within the context of a one-hour\n\nfilm, what is exceptional, striking, immortal about the work of this composer. Given more time, I\n\nwould have loved to see more detail on the theatrical dance of the time (we are told that Rameau\n\nwas the greatest composer for the dance before Stravinsky, but we are not shown why this is so),\n\nand perhaps some discussion of how French operatic singing differed from the Italian vocalism\n\nof the period (that it differed greatly is evident from the writings of such Italophiles as Charles\n\nBurney, who execrated French singers).\n\nAfter the operatic stimulation of the documentary (who can see the singing frog-princess, Platée,\n\nwithout wanting to see the whole of the opera?), the more restrained idiom of the motet, as fine\n\nas it is, and as fine as its performance is, is a bit of a let-down. Had Rameau never composed for\n\nthe stage, this work would have suffered the fate of all its fellows produced for the church – to\n\nremain unsung in a library archive – and we should never have had this documentary, a\n\ndocumentary which is a fine introduction to one of the greatest of composers and his works.\n\nTom Moore\n\nimage=http://www.operatoday.com/OA0956D.png\n\nimage_description=Jean-Philippe Rameau: In Convertendo Dominus\n\nproduct=yes\n\nproduct_title=Jean-Philippe Rameau: In Convertendo Dominus\n\nproduct_by=Nicolas Rivenq, Sophie Daneman, Jeffrey Thompson, Olga Pitarch Orchestra and Chorus of Les Arts Florissants, William Christie (cond.)\n\nproduct_id=Opus Arte OA 0956 D [DVD]\n\nprice=$20.99\n\nproduct_url=http://www.arkivmusic.com/classical/album.jsp?album_id=140005"
