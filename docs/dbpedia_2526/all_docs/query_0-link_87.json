Title ML128.C48 S57 2009 782.5 22 2008014351\n\n1 3 5 7 9 8 6 4 2 Printed in the United States of America on acid-free paper\n\nPreface\n\nT\n\nhe purpose of this book is to present and discuss the choral music of the most signiﬁcant composers from the Western Hemisphere throughout recorded history. The selection of composers has been determined by their impact on the development of choral music as an art form, and the selection of repertoire has been determined by the relative merit of compositions as reﬂected by critical acclaim, popularity and frequency of performance, and availability in academic and commercial publications. In other words, composers have been chosen on the basis of their historical signiﬁcance, and compositions have been identiﬁed on the basis of their being acknowledged as artistically superior works of art, on their presence in programs of credited ensembles, and on their existence in scholarly editions. The selection process, therefore, has focused on representative composers and compositions, not on an unqualiﬁed and all-inclusive coverage of composers and their music. By being selective, it is hoped that masterpieces of Western choral music will be brought to light, comprehended, and performed more frequently, and that students, practitioners, and enthusiasts of choral music will be guided through the maze of a large and complex array of repertoire. As an aid in this process, composers and repertoire are presented according to their relative importance. The most prominent composers are given separate entries, with performance annotations of their most noteworthy compositions; the composers of lesser prominence are also given separate entries, but with discussion of their repertoire contained in narrative form; and composers of least prominence are discussed in the beginning material of appropriate countries. All composers discussed in the book are listed in the composers’ index; the ﬁrst page indication following a composer’s name, generally in bold typeface, is the primary entry. The following pages are in regular typeface and indicate secondary references, with speciﬁc composer names in parentheses. Most lists of composers in the narrative introductions to eras and countries are in chronological order. In the process of choosing composers and compositions, decisions have been made regarding the relative status of a composer as a producer of original compositions and the relative originality of those compositions. Composers whose choral output consists mostly of or who are known primarily for their arrangements of preexisting material (i.e., folk songs or spirituals) are generally excluded, as are the arranged compositions themselves. Arrangements are included, however, if they are a part of a composer’s output of original repertoire or if they are substantially original in design. For instance, Renaissance masses that incorporate Gregorian chants or that parody previously composed motets are essentially original compositions, while harmonizations of folk songs and hymns are not.\n\nvi\n\nPreface\n\nThe compositions that are discussed and annotated are considered choral if they were composed for an ensemble of voices—generally soprano, alto, tenor, and bass (SATB). This criterion includes music composed speciﬁcally for ensembles of solo voices as well as music composed for ensembles comprised of multiple singers per voice part. Reasoning for such an inclusive definition of choral music acknowledges and is based on performance practices in existence during the era of composition as well as in subsequent years. For example, madrigals and chansons that were composed during the Renaissance era, while conceived as solo vocal compositions, were frequently performed (with the approval of the composers) by multiple voices and instruments per part. Also, vocal chamber works of the nineteenth century (Brahms quartets, for example) have a long and continuous history of being performed by choral as well as by solo ensembles. Indeed, madrigals, chansons, and other vocal chamber works have been and are on the whole performed more by choral ensembles than by soloists. The material in the book is organized and presented in three categories— historical era, countries within the era, and composers within the country or group of countries. The eras are arranged consecutively in order of time, the countries are arranged according to their relative importance in initiating the era and inﬂuencing other countries, and the composers are listed chronologically according to their birthdates (either documented or assumed). Each era begins with a discussion of its time frame and scope and also with an overview of general stylistic traits, and each country or group of countries begins with a listing of representative composers, genres, and musical characteristics. Genres are identiﬁed according to broad categories of deﬁnition, structure, usage, and style. For instance, requiems are included as masses, passions are included as oratorios, and the various subcategories of motets (e.g., o¤ertories, graduals, and antiphons) are all grouped together. Composers have been placed in eras based on the overall or most salient characteristics of their choral music, their inﬂuence in history, and/or their traditional classiﬁcation by scholars. These are particularly important considerations regarding transitional composers—those who lived and worked in times of change and who wrote music in both old and new styles. Thus Guillaume Dufay, Gilles de Bins Binchois, Jean de Ockeghem, and Antoine Busnois are classiﬁed as Renaissance composers because their most signiﬁcant choral output exhibits traits that would become standard during the Renaissance era; Heinrich Schütz, who lived well into the Baroque era and who subscribed to prima prattica ideals throughout most of his life, and Claudio Monteverdi, whose early music is Renaissance in style, are both identiﬁed as Baroque because their mature and most recognized repertoire is infused with Baroque traits (in addition, Monteverdi was one of the chief proponents of the seconda prattica); Franz Schubert composed a considerable amount of music that scholars classify as Romantic in nature, although he is included with Classical era composers since his choral output (especially that which is sacred) is sim-\n\nPreface\n\nilar in most ways to other Classical era compositions; on the other hand, while Ludwig van Beethoven composed a considerable amount of music that scholars classify as Classical in nature, his most important choral works and his historical impact are Romantic. Each composer entry includes the following information: a brief discussion of his or her life with regard to professional activity, especially that involving choral music; an accounting by genre of choral compositions; and a description of the individual genres, with commentary about speciﬁc compositions. As is mentioned above, the entries of major composers (those who have made the most signiﬁcant impact on the development of choral music or who have composed the most signiﬁcant repertoire) also include performance annotations of important works, listed either according to familiarity (i.e., with the most familiar, frequently performed, or highly acclaimed works listed ﬁrst) or in chronological order according to the date of composition (therefore identifying the works relative to the composer’s development). The annotations include: (1) the original title, with subtitle, alternate titles, and textual source or translation (if critical to the understanding of the work); (2) opus or catalogue numbers as they exist or are helpful to the identiﬁcation of the particular work; (3) date of composition if known; (4) speciﬁc scoring, including use of the term chorus for compositions intended for multiple singers per part and voices for compositions intended for single voices per part, the listing of vocal divisions beyond general distributions (e.g., SSAATTBB), and identiﬁcation of orchestral instruments or requirements beyond those for standard or large orchestra; (5) approximate timings in minutes (rounded to quarter portions); and (6) commentary that elucidates aspects of performance. Regarding titles, works that are polytextual (i.e., works with two or more separate texts that occur simultaneously) are listed with a slash between the individual text sources (e.g., the medieval motet Nuper rosarum ﬂores / Terribilis est locus iste by Guillaume Dufay). Works that are multimovement (i.e., works comprised of separate texts that occur successively) are listed with a dash between the individual text sources (e.g., the Renaissance motet Tu es Petrus Quodcumque ligaveris by G. P. da Palestrina). Regarding sources, all Psalms are identiﬁed according to the modern listing. Regarding scoring, the requirements for soloists are listed as S for soprano or high mezzo-soprano, A for low mezzo-soprano or contralto, T for tenor, and B for baritone or bass. A slash between voice parts, either for solo voices (e.g., S/S) or choruses (e.g., SATB/ SATB), indicates distribution of the voices or choruses in separate ensembles. The term orchestra implies scoring for double winds (two ﬂutes, two oboes, two clarinets, and two bassoons), four horns, two trumpets, three trombones, timpani, and strings (violins in two sections, violas, cellos, and string basses). The term large orchestra implies scoring for triple winds, extra brass, and percussion instruments in addition to timpani. Scoring for instruments beyond these categories is generally indicated in parentheses. Original spellings have been preserved as much as possible, and thus the\n\nvii\n\nviii\n\nPreface\n\nreader will ﬁnd variant versions of the same word. For example, the Latin word for heaven will appear variously as celi, caeli, and coeli. Original capitalizations of titles, both of compositions and of other publications, have also been preserved. However, references to works and certain words have been standardized. For instance, words referring to religious deities such as he, father, and son always appear in lower case. Also, archaic usage of words such as thou and thy have been avoided and changed to you and your. Consistent with modern usage, all abbreviations of the word saint appear without a period (i.e., the abbreviation is St instead of St.). Deﬁnitions of most foreign terms as well as of genres and frequently cited musical words or phrases are found in the glossary and also occasionally in the text narrative. The deﬁnitions are only cursory and not meant to be a full explication of etymology, usage, development, or interpretation. Consequently, the reader may wish to refer to standard music dictionaries. Titles in foreign languages are translated in the text only as the translations provide meaningful elucidation to the substance of the composition. Standard Latin titles (e.g., Ave Maria) and Psalms (e.g., Laudate Dominum) are not translated. However, biblical references are provided for the Psalms. It is hoped that this book will be of use to a wide and diverse readership, including the practicing choral conductor, teacher of choral conducting or choral literature courses, student of choral music, choral enthusiast, and choral scholar. It is further hoped that the encyclopedic organization of material as well as the nature of the material itself will accommodate the di¤ering needs, interests, and experiences of readers. In accommodating those readers who will search for speciﬁc data as well as those who will peruse or study material more comprehensively, certain pieces of information are occasionally duplicated (e.g., titles and dates of compositions appear in both the discussion of works and annotations). However, duplication of information is minimal and thus the reader is encouraged to access both the narrative and annotated portions of material in order to be fully informed about a particular composer, subject, or work.\n\nAcknowledgments I wish to express sincere and heartfelt thanks to the following people: Barbara Reynolds, my dearest and most cherished friend, who faithfully and enthusiastically researched every source and reference, veriﬁed every spelling, made helpful suggestions regarding grammar and syntax, and read the entirety of every page of every draft for clarity and continuity.

Before 900 musical notation was limited to neumes and other symbols that indicated only general pitch and rhythm; there were no means to convey the essential components of music so that it could be reliably transmitted from written characters to aural sounds or from composer to performer. But during the early part of the tenth century treatises such as Musica enchiriadis and manuscripts such as the St Gall cantatorium and St Martial troper indicated either syllables of text or neumatic symbols on staves to ﬁx pitches relative to each other, and during the latter part of the tenth century treatises and manuscripts indicated both pitches and rhythms. By the eleventh century a relatively standardized system of notation had been developed, and at the beginning of the twelfth century distinct genres and individual composers began to emerge and be identiﬁed. Medieval genres consisted of monophonic chants, laude, and songs during the earlier years of the era, and polyphonic mass movements, mass cycles, motets, and secular songs during the later years. The sacred genres (chants, laude, mass movements and cycles, and motets) were generally sung by solo voices in combination with each other or by multiple voices per part. The secular genres (songs by the troubadours and trouvères, and the ballades, rondeaux, and virelais of the formes ﬁxes) were performed by unaccompanied single solo voices (the monophonic songs), by single solo voices accompanied by instruments (the polyphonic compositions with only one texted voice part), or by multiple solo voices with or without instrumental participation (the multitexted polyphonic compositions). Chant (often called plainchant or plainsong) is the monophonic liturgical music of the Christian Church. It is generally divided into various categories that reﬂect historical time frame, geographical location, or sectarian usage: Old Roman is the category of liturgical chant composed\n\nT\n\n3\n\n4\n\nChoral Repertoire\n\nbetween the seventh and ninth centuries; Mozarabic refers to the chant repertoire composed during the same time period but speciﬁcally sung by Christians in Spain under Muslim rule; Gallican refers to those chants composed in Gaul before the tenth century; Ambrosian, named after St Ambrose (ca.340–397), is the chant repertoire centered in Milan during the twelfth and thirteenth centuries and known for several hymn texts, presumably written by St Ambrose himself (including “Deus Creator omnium,” “Veni redemptor gentium,” and “Illuxit orbi”); Gregorian is the label given to the liturgical chant repertoire oªcially sanctioned by the Roman Catholic Church and customarily used throughout Europe from the tenth century onward; and ﬁnally, Sarum is the term used for Gregorian chants that were modiﬁed and used throughout the British Isles between the thirteenth and sixteenth centuries, especially at Salisbury Cathedral. Gregorian chant most likely began in the late seventh century with Pope Gregory (590– 604), who called for a common liturgy as a part of his e¤orts to consolidate di¤erent factions of the Catholic Church throughout Italy and Spain. Pope Leo IV (847–855) termed the sung portions of the liturgy in use during his time Gregoriana carmina (Gregorian songs), and Pope John VIII (872–882) credited Gregory with composing many of the chants. While Gregory may in fact have had a role in the origination of chant, the music was not circulated in manuscripts until the tenth century, and most of the chants that became standardized were either notated or composed in the eleventh and twelfth centuries. Even at this time and after, standardization was still relative. Variations of chants occurred as copyists made mistakes or as modiﬁcations were made as a result of oral transfers. Thus composers living during the Medieval and Renaissance eras might have known di¤erent versions, albeit slight, of the same chant. Complete uniﬁcation of Gregorian chant did not occur until the publication of the Liber usualis, which was ordered by Pope Pius X in a motu proprio of 1903 and prepared by the Benedictine monks of Solesmes, France. The total body of Gregorian chant, which includes music for all the Ordinary and Proper services as well as for the Oªces, is vast and complex. However, the number of chants that have become popular and that are performed separately (apart from liturgical services) is somewhat limited. The best known of these, listed here alphabetically and with page numbers in parentheses where the chants can be found in the 1956 edition, number 801, of the Liber usualis (chants with two page numbers refer to simple and solemn forms, respectively), are Ave Maria (1679), Cantate Domino (826), Dies irae (1810), Hodie Christus natus est (413), Magniﬁcat anima mea (207–212), O magnum mysterium (382), Pange lingua (957), Salve regina (279 and 276), and Victimae paschali laudes (780). Other familiar chants include Alma redemptoris mater (277 and 273), Angelus Domini (787), Ave maris stella (1259), Ave regina caelorum (278 and 274), Christus factus est (655), De profundis (499), Deus in adjutorium (1027), Haec dies (783), Jubilate Deo omnis terra (480), Justorum anime (1547), Lauda sion (945), Laudate Dominum (562), Laudate Dominum (1275), Miserere mei Deus (526), Nunc dimittis (271), O sacrum convivium (959), O vos omnes (767), Puer natus est (408), Regina caeli (278 and 275), Stabat mater (1634), Tristis est anima mea (630), Tu es Petrus (1332), Ubi caritas (675), Veni creator spiritus (885), Veni sancte spiritus (880), Veni sponsa Christi (1217), and Venite adoremus (1052). Most of these chants are syllabic, with occasional melismatic passages (Haec dies, which is predominantly melismatic, is an exception). Most of the chants are also through-composed, although there are notable examples of musical structures that correspond to textual patterns. For\n\nThe Medieval Era\n\n5\n\ninstance, in the solemn version of Salve regina (often called “The Great Salve”), the opening two parallel phrases of text—“Salve, regina, mater misericordiae” (Hail, queen, mother of mercy) and “Vita, dulcedo, et spes nostra, salve” (Life, sweetness, and our hope, hail)—are matched by nearly identical musical phrases. Likewise, the following two phrases that begin “Ad te clamamus” (To you we cry) and “Ad te suspiramus” (To you we sigh) are also musically similar. In the solemn version of Ave regina caelorum, the ﬁrst two phrases begin identically, and in Ubi caritas, the ﬁve phrases of text result in a musical structure of AAABB. Nonliturgical monophonic compositions include laude composed for use in private devotionals, and church dramas composed as theatrical productions within sacred services. The laude are mainly simple syllabic chants set in verse/refrain format to Italian texts. Gloria in cielo e pace in terra from the fourteenth-century Florence Laudario is an example. The church dramas (often called liturgical dramas because of their association with liturgical feasts) are biblical stories set to monophonic melodies for soloists and chorus and are performed with costumes, scenery, and staging. Famous examples include The Play of Daniel, The Play of Herod, The Play of Mary, The Stranger, and The Bridegroom. Monophonic compositions derived from Gregorian chant and polyphonic mass movements and motets are divided into four separate periods—St Martial (1100–1180), Notre Dame (1180–1260), Ars Antiqua (1260–1320), and Ars Nova (1320–1500). The St Martial period, so named because of a large collection of manuscripts housed in the Benedictine monastery of St Martial in Limoges, is characterized by monophonic tropes and sequences, and two-voiced compositions in discant and organum styles. The organum style was especially important to the development of polyphony, for it contained compositional elements that were to be incorporated into most compositions for the remainder of the era. The lower part was a portion of a chant melody with its original Latin text that was set to very slow-moving rhythms, while the upper part, with a di¤erent Latin text, was a freely composed melody set to considerably faster-moving rhythms. The titles of these bitextual compositions, such as Vox nostra resonet / Benedicamus domino, consist of the ﬁrst words of each text, beginning with the top voice part. The Notre Dame period is known for a large body of repertoire that was written for liturgical services at Notre Dame Cathedral in Paris. Two composers are closely associated with this period—Léonin, who was active between about 1180 and 1190, and Pérotin, who was active around the year 1200. Léonin is credited with writing the Magnus liber organi de gradali et antifonario (Great book of organum for the gradual and antiphoner), which is a collection of mostly two-voiced pieces with elaborate melismatic upper parts over very slow-moving lower parts. Pérotin supposedly revised the Magnus liber and added pieces for three and four voice parts. Examples include the four-part Viderunt omnes and Sederunt principes, each of which is set to one text, with the upper parts in a rhythmically active discant style over a slow-moving fragment of chant. The Ars Antiqua compositions continued the convention of rhythmically active upper parts set to their own texts over a slower-moving, chant-based lower part. However, the upper parts were often set to French texts, and each part had individual rhythmic characteristics (one was usually faster moving than the other or others). The lower parts were taken from chant or secular song repertoire. An example, which comes from the Montpellier Codex (one of the richest sources of music from the Ars Antiqua) is Celui en qui / La belle estoile / La belle, en qui / Johanne. In this\n\n6\n\nChoral Repertoire\n\nmotet the top voice part is a secular text that extols the virtues of Lady Marion, the second voice part praises the Virgin Mary, the third part is a secular love poem, and the bottom part is the middle syllable of the name Johannes (St John). The Ars Nova, which took its name from the treatise Ars nova written in about 1322 by Philippe de Vitry, is distinguished by music organized according to isorhythmic techniques (i.e., at least one of the voice parts—usually the lowest—was divided into several identical rhythmic phrases called talea, or identical rhythmic and melodic phrases called color). The upper parts, frequently of similar rhythmic values, shared short musical motifs. While isorhythm was a characteristic throughout the Ars Nova, the relative rhythmic activity between the parts changed. The mass movements and motets at the beginning of the period by such composers as Philippe de Vitry, Guillaume de Machaut, and Johannes Ciconia continued to have fast-moving upper parts against a slower-moving lower part. Music composed at the end of the era by Leonel Power and John Dunstable had parts that were more rhythmically similar. By the time of the earlyRenaissance composers Gilles Binchois, Jean de Ockeghem, and Antoine Busnois, compositions for four voices became the norm, with melodic and rhythmic material integrated among the parts. Almost all of the compositional activity during the early and middle years of the Medieval era was centered in Italy and France. Monophony developed in Italy, polyphony developed in France, and most composers spent their lives in one country or the other. By the latter years of the era compositional activity included England and Burgundy (the area now occupied by northern France and the Netherlands). The major Medieval-era composers are Hildegard von Bingen, who was an innovator in the composition of monophonic plainsong separate from Gregorian liturgical chant; Machaut and Ciconia, the poet-composers whose works were mainly polytextual; and Power and Dunstable, who infused the continental style with British characteristics.\n\nHildegard von Bingen 1098–1179 Hildegard (the name used in all reference sources) was born in Bermerscheim, near Mainz, Germany. She began having mystical visions at age ﬁve, and at eight her parents sent her to a convent associated with the Benedictine monastery of St Disibod near Bingen. She remained at the convent for approximately forty years, leading a completely ascetic life for the ﬁrst half of this time, with contact to the outside world only through letters, and becoming magistra when her superior died in 1126. During the next two decades she became famous locally for her prophecies and miracles, and in 1147 she founded her own convent in the nearby town of Rupertsberg. The convent ﬂourished, and in 1152 it was oªcially recognized by the Archbishop of Mainz. During the 1140s and 1150s Hildegard compiled a book of her visions, notated in poetry and music and entitled Scivias, an abbreviation of the phrase “Scito vias Domini” (Know the ways of the Lord). Two other books of her visions followed before 1160—Liber vite meritorum (Book of the merits of life) and Liber divinorum operum (Book of divine works), which together with Scivias form a trilogy that in modern times has been called Symphonia armonie celestium revelationum (Symphony of the harmony of celestial revelations). Hildegard also wrote two medical treatises during the 1150s—Physica, about herbal cures, and Cause et curae, about compound medicine. In addition, she wrote what is believed to be the ﬁrst sacred musical drama—Ordo vir-\n\nThe Medieval Era\n\n7\n\ntutum (Rite of the virtues). Between 1160 and 1170 she made numerous preaching and missionary visits to cities throughout Germany, and in September 1179 she died at her convent in Rupertsberg at age eighty-one. There are a total of seventy-seven monophonic chants in the three volumes of Symphonia armonie. Hildegard’s poetry for the chants focuses on women, particularly the Virgin Mary and St Ursula, and is replete with exotic imagery. For example, Mary is described as the “viridissima virga” (greenest branch), whose “calor solis in te sudavit sicut odor balsami” (scent was like balsam distilled in the sun), and the “ﬂos quem hyems de ﬂatu serpentis numquam lesit” (ﬂower that the winter of the serpent’s breath has never hurt). St Ursula—the martyred princess of the fourth century who supposedly traveled with eleven thousand virgins before her death by the Huns in Cologne, Germany—is described as a “favus distillans” (dripping honeycomb) with “mel et lac sub lingua eius” (milk and honey under her tongue). The music of the chants is idiosyncratic, with unusual melodic contours set in unconventional modal contexts. While certain melodic motifs occur with frequency, the music seems to have no formal organization. The writing in Ordo virtutum is less irregular; it consists mostly of syllabic settings of narration that relate a morality story about the soul (called “Anima”) struggling with sixteen virtues and the devil.\n\nchants selected and listed according to familiarity\n\nO viridissima virga (in praise of Mary) – 4:15 minutes.

There is conjecture that he died in Naples between 1285 and 1288. However, he may have died in England sometime after 1306. The former conclusion seems most logical, given that Adam spent most of his life in Italy and that the report of his death is in\n\n8\n\nChoral Repertoire\n\na document written by his nephew. From commentary in Adam’s two plays—Le jeu de Robin et de Marion and Le jeu d’Adam ou de la feuillie—it is known that he studied in Paris and that he worked in Italy at the courts of Charles of Anjou and Robert II, Count of Artois. In addition to approximately sixty monophonic songs, Adam composed ﬁve motets and sixteen polyphonic rondeaux. The motets are early examples of the genre’s form and style that would become popular during the later years of the Medieval era: they are polytextual, with two freely composed rhythmically active upper voice parts in French over a rhythmically inactive lower part that is often a fragment of Gregorian chant. This lower part is often untexted, although it is given the Latin name of its derivation in the title of the motet. Examples include De ma dame vient / Diex, comment porroie / Omnes and J’os bien a m’amie parler / Je n’os a m’amie aler / Seculum. The rondeaux, also scored for three voices, are homophonic, with all voices texted and with structures of refrains and verses. Fourteen of the rondeaux are in the formes ﬁxes that would become popular later in the era.\n\nPhilippe de Vitry 1291–1361 Vitry was perhaps born in the Champagne region of France, and he may have studied at the Sorbonne and received a degree in music, though there is no proof of either his birthplace or musical studies. What is known is that he was a canon at Notre Dame in Clermont-en-Beauvais beginning in 1322; that he served in a secretarial capacity to the French kings Charles IV (Charles IV le bel, 1322–1328), Philip VI (Philippe VI de Valois, 1328–1350), and John II (Jean II de France, 1350–1364); and that he was appointed Bishop of Meaux in 1351. He was a noted intellectual, poet, philosopher, mathematician, historian, and musician, and he received praise from many notable people of his day, including the poet Petrarch (Francesco Petrarca, 1304–1374), who called Vitry “the great philosopher of our age” and “an unparalleled poet of France.” Although Vitry most certainly wrote numerous poems, treatises on various subjects, and musical compositions, all that have survived are two poems (Le chapel des trois ﬂeurs de lis and Le dit du franc Gontier), one treatise (Ars nova), and approximately twelve motets. The poems, about political circumstances of the time, were popular and were circulated throughout France. The treatise (ca.1322) is undoubtedly one of the most important musical discourses in history; it presented new concepts of rhythm and notation, and its title became the reference for all music composed until approximately 1500. The motets, which manifest the principles set forth in Ars nova, followed the model initiated by Adam de la Halle of two rhythmically active upper voices above a slower-moving lower part. However, Vitry gave the motet an isorhythmic structural organization that would be emulated by later composers of the fourteenth century. That is, most of the parts were constructed in repeated rhythmic patterns (talea). Six of the motets can conclusively be ascribed to Vitry, another six have a high degree of probable authenticity, and several more are assumed to be by Vitry based on stylistic grounds. Many of the texts, like the poems, deal with political circumstances of the time, and several of the motets are contained in Roman de Fauvel, a collection of pieces by numerous composers that were integrated into a poem by Gervais de Bus. O canenda / Rex quem / Rex regum praises the crusade leader Robert, King of Sicily and Jerusalem, and Petre clemens / Lugentium siccentur / Non est inventus is about the controversial seat of the papacy (Avignon or Rome). Other notable\n\nThe Medieval Era\n\n9\n\nmotets are Garrit Gallus / In nova fert / N[euma] for AAT voices, Tuba sacre ﬁdei / In arboris / Virgo sum also for AAT voices, and Vos quid admiramini / Gratissima virginis / Gaude gloriosa for ATTT voices. In this last-named motet, the lowest voice (which is based on the text phrase “Gaude gloriosa” from the chant antiphon Ave regina caelorum) has a ninety-measure color that is divided into six talea, and the upper voices contain numerous rhythmic repetitions.\n\nJacopo da Bologna fl.1340–1360 Jacopo (referenced under Jacopo, not Bologna) may have been born in Bologna. However, he spent the majority of his life in Milan and Verona—at the court of Luchino Visconti in Milan from 1339 until the death of Visconti in 1349, at the court of Mastino II and Alberto della Scala in Verona from 1349 until the death of Alberto in 1352, and back in Milan thereafter. As with most composer-poets of the Medieval era, his presence in the courts is known not from any documentary evidence, but rather from textual references in his musical compositions and from references in the music of contemporary composers. For instance, Jacopo’s madrigal Lo lume vostro and motet Lux purpurata both praise Visconti, and the madrigal O in Italia refers to twin sons born to Visconti on August 4, 1346. Jacopo’s presence in Milan is conﬁrmed by references in the madrigals of Giovanni de Cascia and Piero (no known other name), who both worked for Mastino II in Verona. Also, Jacopo’s madrigal Non al suo amante, set to a poem by Petrarch (the only known musical setting of Petrarch’s poetry during the poet’s life), was no doubt composed in Milan, where Petrarch was in residence after 1347. Finally, the late three-voiced madrigal Aquila altera / Creatura gentile / Uccel di Dio was most likely composed in 1355 for the coronation of Charles IV, whose crest was depicted with an eagle. The superius (soprano) text speaks of a lofty eagle with a valiant eye; the contratenor (alto) text refers to the eagle as a noble creature, worthy to ascend on high; and the tenor text compares the eagle to the bird of God, who triumphs with great deeds on earth. Jacopo composed one motet, one lauda, and thirty-two madrigals. In addition, he wrote a treatise, L’arte del biscanto misurato (The art of measured polyphony), and numerous poems. The motet Lux purpurata, which is considered to be Jacopo’s most beautiful composition, is for three voices (SAT), two of which (SA) are texted. Twenty-ﬁve of the madrigals are for two voices, and seven are for three voices. All voices are texted and were presumably sung by soloists. Many of the madrigals were quite popular during the latter half of the fourteenth century; they existed throughout Italy in multiple manuscripts and in varying versions (i.e., some of the madrigals are scored for both two and three voices). The best known of these are Aquila altera / Creatura gentile / Uccel di Dio and Si come al canto for TTB voices, Fenice fu’ and Non al suo amante for AB voices, and O cieco mondo for ST voices.\n\nGuillaume de Machaut ca.1300–1377 Machaut was likely born in or near Reims (formerly spelled Rheims), where he spent the major part of his life. Like most other composers of the time, he was a poet as well as a musician, and his poems contain commentary on major contemporary events as well as laudatory tributes to\n\n10\n\nChoral Repertoire\n\nhimself and to the lives of notable people he met. The poems are particularly personal in that he describes his amorous feelings and praises his own music. For example, in his most famous poem, Loange des dames, which was written when he was an old man, he confesses his love for the nineteen-year-old Péronne d’Armentières, and in another poem he states that he ﬁnds pleasure in listening to his rondeau Dix et sept, cinc, trese and ballade Quant Theseus / Ne quier veoir. There is little biographical information in the poetry, however, and as a consequence, all that is known about Machaut’s professional activities are the mere facts of his position as secretary to Jean de Luxembourg, King of Bohemia, from 1323 to the king’s death in 1346, and as a canon at Reims Cathedral beginning in 1340. While in the employ of the king, Machaut traveled widely and became famous for his poems and compositions, and while serving at Reims Cathedral, he was visited by numerous dignitaries, including Charles II, King of Navarre; Jean, Duke of Berry; and Philip the Bold, Duke of Burgundy. Late in his life Machaut reproduced some of his manuscripts for important patrons, and he collected and organized his entire output of poetry and music. Machaut composed one mass cycle, twenty-three motets, one hocket, forty-two ballades, twenty-two rondeaux, thirty-three virelais, and nineteen lais. In addition, he wrote approximately three hundred poems. All his music is in the Ars Nova style as described and exhibited by Philippe de Vitry; all but three of the motets, the Hoquetus David, and four of the mass movements are isometric; and all the works are polyphonic except for the lais, most of the virelais, and one of the ballades. The mass cycle Messe de nostre dame is unquestionably the most famous composition of the Medieval era. Probably composed in the 1360s for Saturday celebrations of the Lady Mass at Reims Cathedral, it is the ﬁrst-known cycle of the ﬁve portions of the Roman Catholic Mass Ordinary. The Kyrie, Sanctus, and Agnus Dei (plus the Ite missa est, which is not part of the Ordinary but which Machaut added at the end of the mass) are isometric and based on the Gregorian chant Kyrie cunctipotens genitor. The Gloria and Credo are free in melodic material and constructed according to non-isorhythmic techniques. The isometric procedures are complex and imaginative. In the Christe portion of the Kyrie, for instance, all four voice parts are divided into three talea, and in addition, the rhythms of two of the parts are mirrored. Speciﬁcally, the triplum (soprano) and motetus (alto) each have talea that begin and end simultaneously; the tenor and contratenor are also paired with talea, although they do not line up with the triplum and motetus; and the tenor and contratenor rhythms, apart from the talea, are grouped in twomeasure segments that mirror each other as seen from the beginning and end of the movement. Furthermore, the triplum and motetus talea are somewhat deceptive in that they are separated by measures of independent rhythm. The non-isorhythmic construction techniques are also worthy of note, especially regarding the modern nature of the material’s organization. As an example, the Gloria begins with a four-measure introduction, proceeds with four large sections that are divided into repeated patterns (A, B, and C), and ends with a short coda-like section. Additionally, there is a motif of seven notes that pervades the entire movement. All of the motets are polytextual. Furthermore, all but two have three simultaneous texts, seventeen are in a combination of French and Latin, and four are only in Latin. As was mentioned above, most of the writing is isorhythmic, with both color and talea, and in ten of the motets the ﬁnal talea is in rhythmic diminution. A few of the motets contain texts that glorify particular people or that comment on political situations of the time. Bone pastor Guillerme /\n\nThe Medieval Era\n\n11\n\nBone pastor qui pastores, for example, was composed in 1324 for Guillaume de Trie, Archbishop of Reims, and Plange, regni respublica / Tu qui gregem / Apprehende arma et scutum et exurge refers to the conquests of Charles, Duke of Normandy. The majority of the motets, however, combine French texts about the anguishes of love with fragments of Gregorian chant. In De souspirant cuer dolent / Tous corps qui de bien amer / Suspiro, the ﬁrst text includes the phrase “Puis que n’a de pité point dou mal que j’endure, qui me fait en desirant languir” (She has no pity for the ills I su¤er, and makes me languish in desire); the second text ends with the phrase “Ou merci procheinnement de ma dame debonnaire, ou morir en languissant” (I must soon receive from love my sweet lady’s grace or else die languishing); and the bottom chant fragment is set to the word “suspiro” (I sigh). While most of the ballades, rondeaux, and virelais are polyphonic, they have only one voice that is texted. That is, they were intended to be performed as solo songs with instrumental accompaniment. Machaut even commented on performance by organ, bagpipes, and other instruments. The three pieces that have multiple texts, including Quant Theseus / Ne quier veoir (a four-part ballade with two texted parts), have become well known. The rondeau Ma ﬁn est mon commencement (My end is my beginning) is famous for its namesake canonic structure: the lower voice part states the same music twice, ﬁrst forward and then backward, while the two upper parts do likewise, interchanging music at the middle of the rondeau.\n\nmass Messe de nostre dame – SATB voices – 27 minutes.\n\nmotets selected and listed in the order machaut indicated in his complete works\n\nDe souspirant cuer dolent / Tous corps qui de bien amer / Suspiro – ATT voices – 3:30 minutes.

However, historical documents citing his presence in Italy, stylistic analysis of his music, and comparison of references in his music to historical events reasonably place his birth at about 1370 in Liège and his employment in Italy. A letter from Pope Boniface IX in 1391 mentions Ciconia’s association with Cardinal Philippe d’Alençon at S Maria in Trastevere, Rome; Ciconia’s madrigal Una panthera was composed later in the decade for the visit of dignitaries to the court of Giangeleazzo Visconti in Pavia; and after 1401 Ciconia composed four motets praising bishops of Padua Cathedral, including O felix templum jubila for Stefano Carrara, Albane, misse celitus / Albane, doctor maxime for Albane Michel, and Petrum Marcello Venetum / O Petre, antistes inclite for Pietro Marcello. In addition, two motets—Ut te per omnes celitus / Ingens alumnus Padue and Doctorum principem / Melodia suavissima / Vir mitis—praise Francesco Zabarella, Archpriest of Padua Cathedral and the person responsible for appointing Ciconia cantor et custos (musical leader and tutor) of the cathedral in 1403. Other compositions include references to Francesco Carrara, Lord of Padua, in the madrigal Per quella strada lacteal del cielo, and Michele Steno, Doge of Venice from 1400 to 1413, in the motet Venecie, mundi splendor / Michael, qui stena domus / Italie mundicie. Like most other notable composers of the Medieval era, Ciconia was a poet who wrote texts that included not only the names of important people of the time, but also his own name. Unlike these other composers, however, Ciconia often elaborated on his name. These references occur frequently in the motets. For example, O felix templum jubila ends with a plea to bishop Stefano Carrara “to receive me, Ciconia, although I am unworthy of such an honor”; the tenor part of Venecie, mundi splendor / Michael, qui stena domus / Italie mundicie ends with the signature “Johannes Ciconia,” which corresponds to the “Amen” at the end of the other texts; and the duplum text of Petrum Marcello Venetum / O Petre, antistes inclite ends with the statement “Help your Ciconia who brought this song into being.” The most signiﬁcant and distinguishing characteristic in Ciconia’s music is hocket. Long passages in most of the motets consist of very short two- or three-note motifs that are passed back and forth from voice to voice with considerable rhythmic activity. Notable examples occur at the ends of Venecie, mundi splendor / Michael, qui stena domus / Italie mundicie and the Gloria Et in terra pax / Spiritus et alme, as well as throughout Doctorum principem / Melodia suavissima / Vir mitis. Ciconia composed eleven mass movements, ten motets, ﬁfteen ballatas, four madrigals, three virelais, and two canons. He also wrote a treatise on music—Nova musica. The mass movements, which are settings of the Gloria and Credo portions of the Ordinary, include four Glorias and three Credos for three voices, and three Glorias and one Credo for four voices. Most of the settings are like motets in that they have text in only the top two voice parts. However, two of the settings have text in only one voice part, and two have text in all voice parts. These latter two settings—a Gloria and Credo paired because of similar melodic material—are unique in that all three voice parts of each setting are of comparable rhythmic density and imitative texture. Most of the motets are scored for three voice parts. The top two (triplum and duplum), with di¤erent texts in Latin, are characterized by fast-moving rhythmic activity, similar ranges, shared melodic material, and extensive passages of hocket. The lower voice part (tenor) is untexted and characterized by slower-moving rhythms. The texts are frequently celebratory in na-\n\nThe Medieval Era\n\n13\n\nture and, as is mentioned above, allude to speciﬁc people, places, or events. In addition to the citations of this sort already mentioned, O Padua, sidus preclarum praises the city of Padua, and Venecie, mundi splendor / Michael, qui Stena domus / Italie, mundicie describes Venice as being the splendor of the world and the pride of Italy. The secular music, all for solo voices, is in French (the virelais), Italian (the madrigals and ballatas), and Latin (the canons). The ballatas, which combine stylistic features of Jacopo da Bologna and Philippe de Vitry, are mostly for two and three voices, with the tenor of the threevoiced pieces generally untexted (although one ballata, Deduto sey, has text in all three voice parts). Three of the madrigals are for two voices, while the fourth is for three voices, all texted. One of the virelais, Aler m’en veus en strangne partie, a farewell to France, is for two voices, while the other two virelais and both canons are for three voices.\n\nmass movements selected and listed according to familiarity\n\nGloria and Credo (listed as numbers 1 and 2 in the complete works) – SST voices (all texted) – 9:30 minutes.

There is also no information about his musical training or youth and little information about his activities as an adult.\n\n14\n\nChoral Repertoire\n\nHe instructed the choristers in the London chapel of Thomas, Duke of Clarence, sometime before 1421, and from 1423 until his death he was associated with Canterbury Cathedral, most likely as a choirmaster. He composed seven complete or partial mass cycles, nineteen individual mass movements, and eighteen motets. Of these works, six are attributed to John Dunstable as well as to Power. Two of the mass cycles contain all ﬁve portions of the Ordinary, one cycle contains all portions except the Kyrie, two have only Gloria and Credo portions, and two have only the Sanctus and Agnus Dei. All of the cycles are uniﬁed by melodic material—a relatively innovative procedure during Power’s lifetime. The ﬁrst of the complete cycles is based on the Gregorian chant Rex seculorum, and the second is based on an unknown source and is therefore referred to as Sine nomine (without name). The almost complete cycle, Power’s most famous, is based on the Gregorian chant Alma redemptoris mater. Two of the remaining partial cycles and many of the individual mass movements are based on Sarum chants. Most of the motets are also based on chant (generally, but not always, the chant corresponding to the motet’s name). In some of the motets, such as Beata progenies and the three-voiced setting of Ave regina celorum, the chant is stated completely in one voice. In other motets the chant is either paraphrased in one voice (as in Gloriose virginis) or treated freely throughout all voices (as in the four-voiced setting of Ave regina celorum). Three of the motets—Beata progenies, the three-voiced setting of Ave regina celorum, and Beata viscera—are in discant style, while most of the other motets are characterized by rhythmically active and independent voice parts. A majority of the motets have only one texted voice part. However, three motets—Alma redemptoris mater, the four-voiced setting of Ave regina celorum, and Gloriose virginis—have two texted voice parts, and four motets—Anima mea, Ibo michi ad montem, Quam pulchra es, and Salve sancta parens—have all voice parts texted. Ave regina celorum is unique in that the texted voice parts (SA) are similar in their rhythmically active texture while the other voice parts (TT) are similarly inactive. This setting of Ave regina celorum is also unique in having passages of hocket.\n\nmotets complete and listed alphabetically\n\nAlma redemptoris mater – ATT voices (A texted) – 5 minutes.

He was an astronomer, mathematician, and musician, and he was in the service of John, Duke of Bedford, and Humfrey, Duke of Glouster. He also was associated with the parish church of St Stephen Walbrook, where he was buried. The sparsity of biographical detail about Dunstable’s life is surprising, considering that he was one of the most famous musicians of the age and praised by numerous authors, including the well-known theorists Johannes Tinctoris and Franchinus Ga¤urius. Dunstable was also credited with originating a new sound called contenance angloise (English countenance), which featured more triadic harmonies and smoother-moving melodies than had been the norm in earlier works by English composers and which was in contrast to mainland European works. Dunstable’s extant compositional output includes ﬁve mass cycles, fourteen individual mass movements, thirty-nine motets, and ﬁve secular pieces. Some of these works are also attributed to Leonel Power and Guillaume Dufay, and there is speculation that Dunstable composed a second Magniﬁcat, the ballade Je languis, and the Christmas carol I pray you all. The mass cycles include two complete settings of the Ordinary (Missa Rex seculorum and Missa Sine nomine), one complete cycle except for an Agnus Dei (Missa Da gaudiorum premia), and two cycles that contain only Glorias and Credos (Jesu Christe ﬁli Dei and a work based on an unknown and unnamed source). The individual mass movements include two Kyries, ﬁve Glorias, three Credos, three Sanctuses, and one Agnus Dei. Almost all of the movements, whether in cycles or not, follow the model of masses and motets written by previous composers. However, Dunstable’s masses are more modern in that the lowest part is frequently texted, and the rhythmic activity of this part approaches that of the upper parts. Approximately half the motets are similar to the mass movements in scoring and texture, and half follow the traditional model of slow-moving and untexted tenor parts. About a third of all the motets are isorhythmic, two-thirds are without rhythmic organization, and several (e.g., the well-known Quam pulchra es) are in discant style. Several motets also feature the new compositional technique of paraphrasing a chant melody in the top voice. These motets include Ave regina celorum, Regina celi letare, and one of Dunstable’s most famous isorhythmic motets, Veni sancte spiritus / Veni creator spiritus, which was copied in ﬁve major manuscripts of the time. The\n\n16\n\nChoral Repertoire\n\nlowest voice part of the motet, precisely the “mentes tuorum visita, imple superna gra-” portion of the Veni creator Gregorian chant, has three color in successively diminished rhythmic values (the ratio proportion being 3:2:1), each composed of two talea. Two di¤erent talea comprise each third of the top voice of the motet, which is a paraphrase of the Veni creator chant. The ﬁrst two talea of this top voice paraphrase the ﬁrst four phrases of the chant (“Veni creator spiritus,” “Mentes tuorum visita,” “Imple superna gratia,” and “Quae tu creasti pectora”), and the last two talea repeat the ﬁrst and second phrases, thus imparting an ABA melodic structure to the top voice part.\n\nmass cycles and mass movements selected and listed according to familiarity\n\nMissa Rex seculorum – ATT voices (A and the ﬁrst T texted) – 28 minutes.

More accurately, the era began during the ﬁnal decades of the ﬁfteenth century and ended, for the most part, by the third decade of the seventeenth century. The attributes that would deﬁne and generally characterize the initial years of the Renaissance—single texts, standard scoring for SATB ensembles, integrated musical material (i.e., motivic material distributed throughout all voice parts), and imitative textures—began appearing as early as the 1470s in the music of such composers as Guillaume Dufay and Jean de Ockeghem. These composers also wrote in Medieval styles (e.g., isorhythmic conﬁgurations in sacred music and formes ﬁxes structures in secular music), and thus the end of the ﬁfteenth century was transitional, with relatively consistent application of Renaissance styles not being evidenced until the beginning of the sixteenth century in the music of Loyset Compère, Alexander Agricola, and Josquin Desprez. The change to new styles was not complete during the early years of the sixteenth century, however. A few Medieval compositional styles continued to be found—such as the combination of original Gregorian cantus ﬁrmus textual phrases along with other texts and long and prolix poems or prose narratives. Similarly, the styles of the Renaissance existed side by side with the new styles of the Baroque era during the ﬁrst two decades of the seventeenth century. Fixing one date for both the ending of the Renaissance and the beginning of the Baroque is particularly troublesome, for the Baroque began in 1600 but the Renaissance did not end until the deaths of Jan Pieterszoon Sweelinck in 1621 and William Byrd in 1623. A few composers even carried the Renaissance style much later (e.g., Melchior Franck, who died in 1639, and Gregorio Allegri, who died in 1652). At the beginning of the Renaissance, styles were mainly characterized by long phrases of text and incipient forms of imitative polyphony (e.g., imitation being conﬁned to duets or imitation not prevalent in all voice parts). By the middle of the era, texts often consisted of only sev-\n\nF\n\n17\n\n18\n\nChoral Repertoire\n\neral short phrases, and textures were generally uniﬁed by pervasive imitation. At the end of the era, compositional traits were varied: sacred works to Latin texts were generally structured of alternating passages of imitative polyphony and homophony; chorales, Psalm settings, and anthems that were composed for the Protestant Reformation sects as well as lighthearted madrigals, chansons, and other related forms were often homophonic; and serious Italian madrigals consisted of continuous phrases of imitative polyphony. The only unifying characteristics of late Renaissance compositions were short fragments of text (i.e., single words or phrases consisting of only several words) that were set to equally short musical motifs, and varied rhythms that reﬂected the expressive implications of speciﬁc words or short phrases. These word-oriented characteristics were the result of a desire—initiated by the Council of Trent and begun in 1542 by Pope Paul III to reform Catholic liturgies—to e¤ectuate clarity of text in performance. Almost all the early Renaissance composers were born and educated in the area of Europe that at the time was called Flanders or northwest Burgundy and that now is occupied by Belgium and northwestern France. These composers—such as Dufay, Agricola, and Desprez—held appointments throughout France and Italy, where they served in various royal or princely courts and where they developed the style of imitative polyphony. By the middle of the era, the majority of recognized and signiﬁcant composers—including Adrian Willaert, G. P. da Palestrina, and Andrea Gabrieli—were born and employed in Italy and were known for their works in a pervasive imitative style (called point of imitation). By the end of the era, there was no single center of compositional activity; composers came from and worked throughout Europe—for instance, Tomás Luis de Victoria in Spain; Hans Leo Hassler and Melchior Franck in Germany; and William Byrd and Thomas Morley in England. England was last in manifesting Renaissance styles because native composers did not study abroad, and it was not until the middle of the sixteenth century that foreign repertoire was available for performance. The Renaissance era was especially important for the creation of genres that either would continue throughout the remaining historical eras or would disappear during the seventeenth through nineteenth centuries and then reappear in the twentieth century. The enduring genres, those newly created during the Renaissance, include the sacred forms developed as a result of the Protestant Reformation—the French Calvinist Psalm setting, German Lutheran chorale and chorale motet, and English anthem. The genres that were created and that ﬂourished during the Renaissance but that did not experience a continuous history are the madrigal (both Italian and English) and chanson. Genres that were created during the Medieval era—the mass (including Requiem), motet, and related sacred genres such as the Magniﬁcat—continued to be popular throughout the Renaissance and all successive eras. Masses during the Renaissance, which were almost always polyphonic and imitative compositions based on preexisting material (chants, other masses, motets, chansons, and madrigals), utilized a variety of interesting construction techniques. The most common technique employed a preexisting tune as a cantus ﬁrmus, usually placed in the tenor voice and scored in longer note values than the other voice parts. The tune was generally presented without modiﬁcation or elaboration; however, it was frequently inverted (upside down), retrograde (backwards), and retrograde inverted (upside down and backwards), as well as in its original form. Further common construction techniques were paraphrase (a modiﬁcation and elaboration of a preexisting tune), parody (the insertion of a polyphonic section of a preexisting composition into the mass texture), soggetto cavato (a cantus ﬁrmus built from pitches derived from the vowels of a person’s name), and quodlibet (the em-\n\nThe Renaissance Era\n\n19\n\nployment of multiple secular preexisting tunes). Motets at the beginning of the era occasionally employed Gregorian chant phrases as a cantus ﬁrmus, whereas motets during the middle years of the era often employed chant material as a basis for point-of-imitation phrases (e.g., Palestrina’s Veni sponsa Christi uses the four phrases of the Gregorian chant as the organizing material for the four phrases of the motet). By the end of the era, motets were by and large free in both melodic content and structure. Magniﬁcats, on the other hand, were most often based on chant and composed in alternatim style throughout the era (i.e., phrases of Gregorian chant alternated with passages of imitative polyphony). Virtually all the Renaissance genres were composed for voices without speciﬁed instrumental accompaniment. Scoring for speciﬁc instruments was one of the main traits of the Baroque. However, instrumental participation during the Renaissance was common, especially during the latter half of the era. The serpent (a bassoon-like instrument) often played along with bass voices in masses and motets, and it also accompanied Gregorian chants (even following the singers when they processed). In addition, the organ was frequently used to support the a cappella textures of sacred genres. Most cathedrals, chapels, and courts had several organs for this purpose, often with an organ in each performance location. For example, St Mark’s Basilica had an organ in each of its four balconies. For festival occasions or for institutions with elaborate musical programs, consorts of instruments (families of recorders, viols, or sackbuts) would play with the SATB vocal parts colla parte. That is, a family or consort of instruments (all recorders or all viols, for instance) would accompany a speciﬁc vocal scoring—either throughout the piece of music or throughout a complete autonomous section of it. Another family or consort of instruments would be used for another piece or for another section of music, the decision being determined by the expressive characteristics of the music or by the instrumental resources available.\n\nO France O hile almost all of the composers who were considered French during the Renaissance worked in France, a number of the composers were born and employed in the region of northwestern Europe that today comprises western Belgium, the southwestern portion of the Netherlands, and northern France. In order to include this area with all of France and properly identify the total territory of musical activity, historians use the term Franco-Flemish. More precisely, however, the term refers to composers and their repertoire from the area of northwestern Europe no farther north than Ghent in Belgium and no farther south than Chartres in France. Eleven composers—Guillaume Dufay, Gilles de Bins Binchois, Jean de Ockeghem, Antoine Busnois, Loyset Compère, Alexander Agricola, Josquin Desprez, Pierre de La Rue, Jacob Obrecht, Nicolas Gombert, and Jacobus Clemens non Papa—were born in this area; six composers—Pierre Passereau, Claudin de Sermisy, Pierre Certon, Claude Goudimel, Claude Le Jeune, and Guillaume Costeley—were born in Paris; and four composers—Jean Mouton, Antoine Brumel, Clément Janequin, and Loys Bourgeois—were born in other cities in northern France. Only two composers at the very end of the era were born elsewhere: Jan Pieterszoon Sweelinck was born\n\nW\n\n20\n\nChoral Repertoire\n\nin the Netherlands and Peter Philips was born in London. Of particular note, the ﬁrst nine composers of the era were from the Franco-Flemish region, and the last ﬁve composers (excluding Sweelinck and Philips) were from Paris. Approximately half of the French composers had appointments in the royal court, where they served kings from Louis XI (1461–1483) to Henri IV (1589–1610). Three of these composers also served in the court of the Sforza family in Milan, and two served in Ferrara. All the signiﬁcant composers born in the ﬁfteenth century wrote sacred music exclusively for the Catholic Church, while all but two (Bourgeois and Philips) born in the sixteenth century wrote sacred music for both the Catholic and Protestant churches. Bourgeois composed only Calvinist Psalm settings and a few chansons, and Philips composed only Latin motets and Italian madrigals. It should be noted that François I, who reigned from 1515 to 1547 and who was called Le Père et Restaurateur des Lettres (the father and restorer of letters), is considered to be the ﬁrst truly Renaissance monarch in France. Dedicated to art and literature, he brought Leonardo da Vinci to France in the last years of the artist’s life, and he greatly increased the holdings of the royal library. Both Henri II (1547–1559) and Charles IX (1560–1574) persecuted the Huguenots (Protestants who were advocates of the precepts of John Calvin) and thus created an atmosphere that limited the composition of Protestant church music. Henri IV, the only Protestant king of France during the Renaissance era, enacted religious liberties that allowed Protestant church music to ﬂourish. The composers not working for French kings were generally employed at major cathedrals, chapels, churches, and courts throughout France and the Netherlands. Dufay, Binchois, and Busnois had positions at the Burgundian court; La Rue served at the Habsburg-Burgundian court; Brumel spent several years at Notre Dame Cathedral in Paris; Janequin’s career was at Angers and Auch cathedrals and also at the court of the Duke of Guise; Clemens non Papa was succentor for two years at St Donaas in Bruges; Bourgeois was a singer and maître des enfants at St Pierre and St Gervais cathedrals in Geneva; Certon had appointments as a clerk and maître des enfants at Sainte-Chapelle in Paris; Philips was organist at the court of Archduke Albert in Brussels; and Sweelinck served his entire life at the Oude Kirk in Amsterdam. The sacred genres for Catholic liturgies consisted of mass cycles (including Requiems), separate mass movements, Latin motets, and Magniﬁcats; the sacred music for use by Protestants was limited to Psalm settings and sacred chansons; and the secular music was almost exclusively devoted to chansons. Virtually all the masses were based on preexisting melodies, used as a cantus ﬁrmus in the tenor voice part early in the era or as material for pervasive imitation in all voice parts during the end of the era. Gregorian chants were the most common sources of preexisting material, although chansons were popular sources with composers early in the era, and Dufay, Ockeghem, Busnois, Compère, Desprez, La Rue, Obrecht, Mouton, and Brumel all set masses based on the L’homme armé tune. Motets were the freest of the genres in terms of musical content and structure: those composed early in the era often incorporated Gregorian chant and exhibited structural techniques such as canon, those in the middle of the era occasionally employed chant as a basis for point-of-imitation phrases, and those at the end of the era utilized text phrases or single words as the basis for imitation or free expression. Magniﬁcats, which were composed by most of the composers in the early and middle years of the era, generally consisted of alternating passages of polyphony and Gregorian chant (called alternatim style). Settings of Psalms followed the publication of various psalters for use by the Huguenots;\n\nThe Renaissance Era\n\n21\n\nBourgeois is credited with composing a number of tunes and four-part hymn-like settings, and Goudimel followed with more homophonic settings and with some elaborated arrangements. Later composers frequently set the psalter tunes in one of three styles—hymn-like, with the tune often in the tenor part; slightly adorned, with the tune in the soprano part and imitative phrases in the other parts; and motet-like, with imitative phrases in all parts. The chansons have a particularly interesting history. Those by the early composers Dufay, Binchois, Ockeghem, Busnois, Compère, Agricola, and La Rue, and the early pieces of Josquin, are mainly in the formes ﬁxes. Later composers such as Obrecht, Mouton, and Brumel composed chansons in the imitative style of motets at the time. By the middle of the sixteenth century, however, a new homophonic style emerged, one popularized by the famous Parisian publisher Pierre Attaingnant. From the late 1520s until his death in about 1551, Attaingnant published approximately thirty-six volumes of chansons, most of them in the new so-called “Parisian” style. Other publishers followed Attaingnant, including Adrian Le Roy and Robert Ballard in Paris, and Jacques Moderne in Lyons. Chansons became so fashionable that composers such as Passereau, Janequin, Sermisy, Certon, Le Jeune, and Costeley devoted their compositional output to, and became known mainly for, contributions to the genre. The Parisian and imitative styles were prevalent throughout the latter half of the sixteenth century, and other styles emerged as well. Janequin wrote chansons in the “programmatic” style (narrative works that featured onomatopoeic sounds), and Le Jeune wrote pieces governed by the rhythmic principles of musique mesurée (long and short rhythms that corresponded to accented and unaccented speech syllables). In addition to the composers cited above and discussed further in this section of the Renaissance era, mention should be made of Antoine de Févin (ca.1470–1512), Jean Richafort (ca. 1480–ca.1548), and Pierre Sandrin (ca.1490–ca.1561). Févin and Richafort composed masses, motets, Magniﬁcats, and chansons in the styles of their day, and several of their works were frequently parodied by later composers; Sandrin composed only chansons, one of which— Doulce mémoire—became quite famous. Three other composers—Adrian Willaert (ca.1490– 1562), Jacques Arcadelt (ca.1505–1568), and Orlando di Lasso (ca.1532–1594)—were born in Flanders and are occasionally listed with other Franco-Flemish composers. They had no employment in France or Belgium, however, and their music does not reﬂect Franco-Flemish styles. Consequently, they are discussed under the countries that best represent them—Italy in the case of Willaert and Arcadelt, and Germany in the case of Lasso.\n\nGuillaume Dufay (Du Fay) ca.1397–1474 Dufay, whose name was spelled Du Fay and pronounced in three syllables during his lifetime (Du-fa-y), was thought for many years of the twentieth century to have been born in about 1400. However, evidence from contemporary documents and musical references place the date more plausibly at about 1397. He was most likely born in Cambrai, where he was a chorister at the local cathedral from 1409 to 1412 and a subdeacon from 1418 to 1420. During the subsequent years he traveled frequently between northwestern Burgundy, Savoy (in southeastern France), and cities in Italy, composing music for his patrons and, like Johannes Ciconia and others, often mentioning their names in the texts. The ballade Resvelliés vous was composed for the wedding\n\n22\n\nChoral Repertoire\n\nof Carlo Malatesta while Dufay was at his court in Rimini from 1420 to 1424, and the motets Rite maiorem Jacobum and Apostolo glorioso were composed for Cardinal Louis Aleman while Dufay was at his court in Bologna from 1426 to 1428. Dufay entered the service of the papal chapel in Rome in 1428 and departed in 1433 because the chapel was in disarray. He then served as maistre de chapelle for Duke Amédée VIII of Savoy for two years, and in 1435 he returned to the papal chapel, which had moved to Florence. While in Florence, he composed his famous isorhythmic motet Nuper rosarum ﬂores / Terribilis est locus iste for the consecration of S Maria del Fiore (the Duomo) by Pope Eugenius IV on May 25, 1436. Political situations necessitated Dufay’s return to Savoy in 1437, although the conﬂict between Pope Eugenius IV, who was deposed in 1439, and Dufay’s former patron Duke Amédée, who became Pope Felix V, made it impossible for Dufay to work at either the papal chapel or Savoy. Therefore, in 1439 he went to the Burgundian court of Philip the Good, who ruled over one of the most lavish musical establishments in Europe from 1419 to 1467. Many important musicians of the time visited the court, including Johannes Tinctoris in 1460 and Jean de Ockeghem in 1463. Dufay remained in the service of the Burgundian court, although he also served as a canon and maître des petits vicaires (master of the children) at the Cambrai Cathedral from 1458 until the end of his life. He was acknowledged by his contemporaries to be the leading composer of his age, and his music served as an important catalyst of compositional techniques during the Renaissance era. Dufay composed six complete mass cycles (a seventh, Missa Caput, is probably by another, unknown composer), seven partial mass cycles, nineteen individual mass movements, approximately ninety motets, four Magniﬁcats, and eighty chansons. Two of the complete masses— Missa Resvelliés vous (formerly listed as Missa Sine nomine) and Missa S Jacobi—were composed early in Dufay’s career and reﬂect late Medieval styles. The other four masses—Missa L’homme armé, Missa Se la face ay pale, Missa Ecce ancilla Domini, and Missa Ave regina celorum—were composed later and exhibit styles that were to become standard during the Renaissance. These later masses are all scored for four texted voices (SATB), they are all based upon preexisting material, and they all employ a tenor cantus ﬁrmus. Basing the mass on secular music was especially modern; Dufay’s Missa L’homme armé may have been the ﬁrst of the dozens of masses set to this tune, and the use of his own chansons as material for Missa Resvelliés vous and Missa Se la face ay pale was certainly unprecedented. This latter mass is notable for several reasons: the cantus ﬁrmus is heard nine times throughout the mass (once in the Kyrie, Sanctus, and Agnus Dei, and three times each in the Gloria and Credo); each movement begins with identical melodic material (a head motif ) stated in the soprano voice; and the Gloria and Credo movements end with the full texture of the chanson’s distinctive triadic harmonies. The incomplete mass cycles, individual mass movements (mostly for three voices,) and Magniﬁcats (each on a di¤erent Gregorian chant tone) also have chant paraphrases in the soprano voice. The famous Gloria ad modum tube is scored for two texted voices (SS or TT) that form a strict canon and two untexted parts that imitate a two-note trumpet call and increasingly diminish in rhythmic values. The motets are of two types—polyphonic and discant. Most of the polyphonic motets are modeled after the older continental style of Ciconia, with multiple texts, rhythmically active upper parts that exchange motivic material, and independent rhythmically inactive lower parts. Thirteen of these motets are isorhythmic, including Dufay’s single ﬁve-voiced work, Ecclesie militantis / Sanctorum arbitrio / Bella canunt gentes / Gabriel / Ecce nomen Domini, composed for the\n\nThe Renaissance Era\n\n23\n\ncoronation of Pope Eugenius IV in 1431, and Nuper rosarum ﬂores, mentioned above in reference to the consecration of the Florence Duomo. The isorhythmic structure of this latter motet features talea that are repeated in the rhythmic proportions 6:4:2:3, which supposedly mirror the architectural proportions of the cathedral’s famous dome by Filippo Brunelleschi. Other notable polyphonic motets are the three-voiced Flos ﬂorum, which has an unusually ﬂorid upper part, and the four-voiced Ave regina celorum, which Dufay composed at the end of his life and which he requested be sung at his deathbed. The discant motets, mostly for three voices, are in the English contenance angloise style of Dunstable, with homophonic textures in a style referred to as fauxbourdon: the lower two voices follow the general shape of the top voice, which is often a paraphrase of a chant melody. The resulting e¤ect is one of parallel motion chords. Examples are Jesu corona virginum; Vos, qui secuti; and the three-voiced setting of Ave regina celorum. The secular pieces, generally scored for one texted voice and intended for soloists, are mostly in the formes ﬁxes. Noteworthy examples include the ballade C’est bien raison and the rondeaux Donnés l’assault and Adieu ces bons vins de Lannoys. Well-known secular pieces with two texted voices include the ballade La belle se siet and the virelai Helas mon dueil. The rondeau Ce moys de may is scored for three texted voices, and Dufay’s best-known secular piece, Vergine belle, is scored for one texted voice (set to an Italian text by Petrarch) and is in a free form.\n\nmass cycles and mass movements selected and listed according to familiarity\n\nMissa Se la face ay pale – SATB chorus – 35 minutes.

He was an organist at the nearby church of Ste Waudru beginning in 1419, and sometime in the 1420s he joined the Burgundian court, remaining there for approximately three decades. From 1452 until his death he served as provost of the church of St Vincent in Soignies. He was held in high esteem during the early years of the Renaissance—his compositions were copied in more than ﬁfty manuscripts during the latter decades of the ﬁfteenth century, and many of his motets and chansons were parodied by other composers. He was often associated with Guillaume Dufay, his probable colleague at the Burgundian court, with whom he is depicted in the famous 1451 illumination entitled Le champion des dames by Martin le Franc. Binchois composed thirty-four mass movements, twenty-eight motets, six Magniﬁcats, one Te Deum, forty-nine rondeaux, and eight ballades. The mass movements, which include three Gloria/Credo and ﬁve Sanctus/Agnus Dei pairs, are based on various Ordinary chants of the mass. For example, the Kyrie “Angelorum” paraphrases the Kyrie from Mass VIII (page 37 in the Liber usualis), the Kyrie “Orbis factor” paraphrases the Kyrie from Mass IX (page 46), and the Kyrie “Cunctipotens” paraphrases the Kyrie from Mass IV (page 25). The motets and most of the Magniﬁcats are in a simple discant or fauxbourdon style, and most are also characterized by crossrelations and repeated use of a four-note rhythmic ﬁgure. Only one motet is isorhythmic—Nove cantum melodie / Tanti gaude germinis / . . . enixa meritis, composed for the baptism of Prince Anthoine of Burgundy in 1431. This motet is of particular interest in that the text names all nineteen chapel singers at the time, including Binchois himself. The secular songs, unlike those of Dufay, generally conform to older practices of scoring for three parts, only one of which is texted. An exception is the well-known Filles à marier for SATB voices, all texted.\n\nJean de (Johannes) Ockeghem ca.1410–1497 Ockeghem was most likely born in Saint Ghislain, near Mons and the family town of Okegem in East Flanders. He was also most likely a chorister with Gilles Binchois at the church of St Germain in Mons. In 1443 or 1444 Ockeghem became a vicaire-chanteur (lay singer) at the Cathedral of Our Lady in Antwerp, and from 1446 to 1448 he held a similar position at the Moulins court of Charles I, Duke of Bourbon. During this time he also had contact with Guillaume Dufay at the Burgundian court under Philip the Good, whose sister was the wife of Charles I. In 1451 Ockeghem joined the royal chapel under Charles VII (Charles le Victorieux, 1422–1461), and in 1454 he was named premier chapelain (ﬁrst chaplain singer). He remained at the royal court under Louis XI (Louis le Prudent, 1461–1483) and Charles VIII (Charles l’A¤able, 1483–1498), becoming maistre de chapelle de chant du roy in 1464. He was highly respected by his contemporaries, including the theorist Johannes Tinctoris, who called Ockeghem the leading composer\n\nThe Renaissance Era\n\n25\n\nof the age, and by his fellow composers Josquin Desprez, Pierre de La Rue, Antoine Brumel, and Loyset Compère, each of whom composed a lament on Ockeghem’s death. Ockeghem composed ten complete mass cycles, three partial mass cycles, one Requiem, ﬁve motets, and twenty-one chansons. The predominance of mass cycles in his sacred output is indicative of a practice that would become common throughout the early years of the Renaissance. Also indicative of more modern practices is the scoring of most masses for SATB voices (all texted) and the parodying of preexisting material. Missa Ecce ancilla Domini is based on a Gregorian chant (Ockeghem’s only mass to use a sacred melody), Missa Au travail suis is based on the cantus ﬁrmus of a rondeau generally ascribed to Ockeghem, Missa Caput is based on the cantus ﬁrmus of a previously composed Missa Caput (formerly ascribed to Dufay), and Missa L’homme armé is based on the popular secular song of the time. Ockeghem’s three most famous masses are not based on preexisting material and are representative of the composer’s penchant for mathematical complexities. Missa prolationum (prolation or mensuration mass), so called because of its simultaneous use of all four of the prolations (time signatures) prescribed by Philippe de Vitry in his treatise Ars nova, consists of double canons that begin in unison and progress through all intervals until the octave; Missa cuiusvis toni (in whatever mode) is designed to be sung in any of the existing modes or key signatures; and Missa Mi-mi uses only a two-note interval as a head motif and unifying factor throughout the mass. The Requiem is the earliest extant polyphonic setting of the mass for the dead. It is divided into ﬁve sections (Introitus, Kyrie, Graduale, Tractus, and O¤ertorium), each of which is based on the Gregorian chant corresponding to its text (notated in the soprano voice part in a slightly ornamented manner). While its overall scoring is for SATB, many sections are scored for two and three voices. Two of the motets are based on Gregorian chants: Salve regina employs the chant in the bass part (not uncommon for Ockeghem), and Alma redemptoris mater paraphrases the chant in the tenor part. The other three motets—Ut heremita solus, Intemerata Dei mater, and Ave Maria— are freely composed. Intemerata Dei mater is interesting in that it is divided into sections, some of which are scored for two and three voices, and all of which have di¤erent meters. All of the secular compositions are scored for three voices and structured in the traditional formes ﬁxes. Prenez sur moi is a triple canon, and Mort tu as navré de ton dart / Miserere, a lament on the death of Binchois, is in ballade form but with both French and Latin texts—the top voice part has ten verses of a French text, while the two middle parts have the text which begins “Miserere pie.”\n\nmasses selected and listed according to familiarity\n\nMissa prolationum – SATB chorus – 32 minutes.

Little is known of his childhood and musical training, although from references in four of his chansons it is probable that he studied in Paris. In 1465 he held a clerical position at the church of St Martin in Tours, and later that year he held a similar position at the church of St Hilairele-Grand in Poitiers. In 1467 he became a singer at the court of Charles the Bold, Duke of Burgundy, and from 1477 until 1482 he served Charles’s daughter and successor, Mary of Burgundy. For the ﬁnal decade of his life Busnois was a cantor at the church of St Sauveur. He was well known and esteemed during his lifetime. The famous theoretician Johannes Tinctoris dedicated one of his treatises to both Jean de Ockeghem and Busnois, Ockeghem composed a lament on his death, and the early Renaissance composer Loyset Compère often praised him. In addition, several of his chansons were parodied by composers in the early years of the sixteenth century: Je ne demande was used as the basis of masses by Jacob Obrecht and Alexander Agricola, and Fortuna desperata was used in masses by Obrecht and Josquin Desprez. Busnois composed two mass cycles, ten motets, one Magniﬁcat, and sixty-one secular pieces (ﬁfty-eight chansons, two Italian madrigals, and one Flemish song). The sacred works are like those of Ockeghem in that they feature mensuration puzzles and canons. The masses— Missa L’homme armé and Missa O crux lignum—are both scored for SATB chorus, with slightly ornamented versions of the tunes on which they are based used as a cantus ﬁrmus in the tenor part, and with head motifs that begin each movement. Several of the motets (e.g., Victimae paschali laudes, Gaude caelestis domina, and both settings of Regina coeli) are based on Gregorian chants. Others are freely composed. Anthoni usque limina, a motet in honor of St Anthony Abbot, contains a puzzle indicated by the picture of a bell, and In hydraulis, composed in 1467 as a tribute to Ockeghem (who Busnois compared to Pythagoras), contains an ostinato on the word “vale” (farewell). Busnois includes his own name in both motets.\n\nThe Renaissance Era\n\n27\n\nThe secular works, most of which are in the older formes ﬁxes, include the chansons Je ne demande for SATB, Fortuna desperata in two versions (one for ATB and one for SATB), A une damme j’ay fait veu for ATB, and Vostre beauté / Vous marchez du bout du pié for SATB.\n\nLoyset Compère ca.1445–1518 Compère was born in Hainaut, Burgundy (now Belgium). Nothing is known about his youth, musical training, or professional activity before 1474, when he became a singer in the cappella of Galeazzo Maria Sforza in Milan. Compère was probably sent to Milan by Ockeghem, who, because of close ties between the Sforzas and Louis XI of France, was asked to provide singers for the Milanese court. With the death of Galeazzo in 1477 and the reduction of the cappella, Compère returned to France and entered the royal court. In 1486 he was appointed a chantre ordinaire under Charles VIII, and in 1494 he was promoted to chappelain ordinaire et chantre de nostre chappelle. After the death of Charles, Compère served as dean of the church of St Géry in Cambrai until 1500 and as provost of the church of St Pierre in Douai until 1504. The last years of his life were spent at the church of St Quentin. Compère composed two mass cycles, several separate mass movements, forty motets, six Magniﬁcats, and approximately ﬁfty chansons. The two mass cycles are based on preexisting material: Missa L’homme armé employs the popular tune as a cantus ﬁrmus, and Missa Alles regrets parodies Hayne van Ghizeghem’s famous chanson. The motets include three groups of motetti missales (works that substituted for portions of the Mass Ordinary in the Milanese rite) and sixteen individual motets. Three of the individual motets warrant mention—Omnium bonorum plena (a parody of Ghizeghem’s De tous biens plaine), Oªcium de cruce (an example of expressive word painting), and Ave Maria, gratia plena (one of the most famous motets of the early sixteenth century). O bone Jesu, previously ascribed to Compère, was probably composed by Francisco de Peñalosa. The Magniﬁcats consist of settings on six of the Gregorian chant tones— tone one for four voices, tone four for two voices, two settings of tone six for four voices, tone seven for four voices, and tone eight for three voices. The chansons, Compère’s most popular compositions, include ﬁve pieces that are polytextual, with both French and Latin texts (e.g., Male bouche / Circumdederunt and Royne de ciel / Regina celi) and approximately forty pieces in the formes ﬁxes (e.g., Venés, regretz for three voices and L’aultre jour for four voices). Fourteen of the chansons were published by Ottaviano Petrucci in Venice.\n\nAlexander Agricola ca.1446–1506 Agricola may have been born in Ghent, Belgium, where he was most likely a chorister at the church of St Nicholas. From 1471 to 1474 he sang in and composed for the cappella at the court of Galeazzo Maria Sforza in Milan—one of the ﬁrst of several Belgian musicians to do so—and from 1474 to 1476 he served in a similar capacity at the court of Lorenzo de’ Medici in Florence. Beginning in 1476 Agricola was employed as a singer at Cambrai Cathedral in northern France, sometime in the late 1480s he joined the French royal court of Charles VIII, he returned to Italy\n\n28\n\nChoral Repertoire\n\nin 1491 to sing at the Florence Cathedral, and for unknown reasons he went back to the French royal chapel in 1492. In 1500 he was engaged as a singer and composer at the court of Philip the Fair, Duke of Burgundy and King of Castile, and during a visit of the court to Spain in 1506 he died of the plague. His death is conﬁrmed in the elegy Epitaphion Alexandri symphonistae regis Castiliae, which may have been composed by Heinrich Isaac and which notes that Agricola died at the age of sixty while traveling with his master. Agricola worked with Isaac in Florence and with Pierre de La Rue in Burgundy, and he was noted as having one of the most beautiful singing voices of the age. The style of his music exhibits characteristics of Ockeghem and Obrecht, with long melodic phrases, sequences, ostinatos, and parallel tenths. However, Agricola’s phrases are often constructed of short motifs, and the long ﬂow of polyphonic lines is interrupted by frequent cadences. Agricola composed eight complete mass cycles, ﬁve separate mass movements (four Credos and one Sanctus), eighteen motets (including two settings of Salve regina), two sets of Lamentations, three Magniﬁcats, and approximately ﬁfty polyphonic secular songs. Most of the masses are scored for four voices and are structured around cantus ﬁrmi of preexisting secular compositions. Missa Je ne demande uses a chanson by Antoine Busnois, Missa In myne zin uses a polyphonic Flemish song by Agricola himself, and Missa Le serviteur and Missa Malheur me bat are most likely based on chansons by Dufay and Ockeghem, respectively. The other masses as well as the Lamentations and Magniﬁcats are all based on Gregorian chants. The motets exhibit a variety of construction techniques. Si dedero is based on chant, the second of the Salve regina settings employs chant plus the tenor of Walter Frye’s motet Ave regina celorum, and the ﬁrst of the Salve regina settings is structured on a complex canon at the interval of the second with the rubric “facie ad faciem” (meaning that the second voice of the canon is to be sung inverted). Transit Anna timor, Agricola’s only secular motet, is a lengthy work in two movements that describes the fortitude of Queen Anne of France during an illness of Louis XII. Nobis sancte spiritus, perhaps Agricola’s most famous motet, is in a freely imitative style. Most of the secular pieces are scored for three voices and are in the formes ﬁxes. Examples include En actendant, Allez regretz, and Vostre hault bruit. Agricola’s popular chanson Je n’ay dueil is for four voices.\n\nJosquin Desprez (des Prez) ca.1450–1521 The spelling “Desprez,” based on an early-sixteenth-century letter, has been standard for many years, although “des Prez” is used in recent studies because Josquin himself wrote his name in three words as an acrostic—IOSQVIN PREZ DES—in the motet Illibata Dei virgo nutrix, and also because there is conjecture that he was born in the village of Prez in northern France. There are also two ways of referring to the composer—by his ﬁrst name Josquin, and by his surname Desprez (or des Prez). He was generally called by his ﬁrst name during and after his lifetime, and thus some historical studies and reference sources (such as The New Grove Dictionary of Music and Musicians) list his name under J. However, because the sixteenth-century letter mentioned above and other contemporaneous documents conﬁrm his surname as Desprez, other attributions (such as those found in libraries) are catalogued under D. In addition to these two spelling and reference issues, there are two customary beliefs with respect to Josquin’s date of\n\nThe Renaissance Era\n\n29\n\nbirth—in about 1440 ("
