Additionally, calligraphic and statistical evidence from the earliest known manuscripts and printed source for the keyboard sonatas is explored. The study is focused on three ornaments--the appoggiatura, trill, and tremulo--and concludes that: the appoggiaturas in this repertoire were short unless cadential or present in a cantabile tempo, in which case they could be one-third to two-thirds the value of the resolution note; trills were begun on the main note unless preceded by a grace note; tremulo was usually an alternation of a main note with its lower neighbor note and this ornament is normally indicated at points of harmonic prolongation. The last chapter discusses general approaches to arranging these works for the guitar and the specific influence of ornamentation on the performance of the sonatas on guitar. Details from eight sonatas arranged for the guitar are used to exemplify the conclusions of the research.\n\nLee, Ji-Eun. \"A comparison of the keyboard sonatas of Domenico Scarlatti and Antonio Soler.\" Master's thesis, University of Cape Town, 2000. http://hdl.handle.net/11427/7844.\n\nFull text\n\nAbstract:\n\nBibliography: leaves 56-57.\n\nThe main objective of this study is to investigate the relationship between Domenico Scarlatti and Antonio Soler through a comparison of their backgrounds, a discussion of various influences on their works, and their placement within the historical context of the development of the keyboard sonata, Among their most prominent similarities are their inspirations found in the use of national Spanish elements in their compositions and also their modification of and experimentation with formal structure. Both composers' sonatas were composed using structural practices already in place. However, it was through experimentation and modifications, which resulted in increased virtuosity in others, that they bridged the gap between the Baroque and the Classical periods, and contributed profoundly to the development of the keyboard sonata.\n\nGiliberti, Patrizia. \"A interpretação das sonatas de Domenico Scarlatti no piano moderno: edição crítica dos manuscritos: \"Manuscrito P-Cug MM 58, 10 da Biblioteca Geral da Universidade de Coimbra\", \"Essercizi per Gravicembalo (1738) da Biblioteca Nacional de Portugal\" e \"Manuscrito F.

Examples are extracted from piano solo and piano concerto compositions, which were written by composers from Domenico Scarlatti, born in 1685, to George Crumb, born in 1929. The glissando was used as a formal compositional device in the eighteenth century, beginning with the works of Domenico Scarlatti. It evolved from the Schleifer and was ornamental and occasionally melodic in function. Composers of the Classical period, like Ludwig van Beethoven and Carl Maria von Weber, expanded the device into octaves, which before the end of the nineteenth century was adopted by Bedrich Smetana, Johannes Brahms, and Mily Balakirev. Franz Liszt produced many two-hand and double-note glissandi, and his output of glissandi is the most numerous in the entire piano repertoire. In twentieth-century, Bela Bartok produced a dry effect in the glissando, while Prokofiev produced the most numerous glissandi in this century. Hindemith wrote an unusual form of black-and-white glissando; Tippett's example is of the \"fanfare\" effect; and Britten contributed many glissandi in a single work, to a degree perhaps exceeded only by Liszt's works. For nationalistic composers, like Manuel de Falla and Heitor Villa-Lobos, the glissando is a fine device to express the feeling of ethnic emotions, such as joyful and energetic. Besides, the use of the black-key glissando gives composers a fine application for impressionistic purposes, since its pentatonic orientation is easy to liken to images of nature: water, wind, etc. Such examples are found in the works of Claude Debussy, Maurice Ravel, and others. Nonetheless, it becomes less crucial in this harmonic consideration in the works of more recent composers, in whose works the concept of tone-clusters or just a \"noise\" is revealed. This thesis also includes two appendices, one contains a chart of 473 glissandi categorized by function, and the second, an original composition by the author, which includes numerous glissandi in various types.\n\nYáñez, Navarro Celestino. \"Nuevas aportaciones para el estudio de las sonatas de Domenico Scarlatti. Los manuscritos del Archivo de Música de las Catedrales de Zaragoza.\" Doctoral thesis, Universitat Autònoma de Barcelona, 2016. http://hdl.handle.net/10803/394016.\n\nFull text\n\nAbstract:\n\nTradicionalment, s’ha donat per descomptat que la difusió de la música de Domenico Scarlatti durant el segle XVIII a Espanya fou escassa. Es creia que la circulació de música de tecla es va circumscriure a la cort de Madrid i la seva propera àrea d’influència, sobretot, per dues raons. La primera, pel fet que el nombre de còpies manuscrites trobades als arxius espanyols era reduïda, cosa que ha canviat en els darrers últims anys. La segona, pel desconeixement de que podria existir a Espanya una gran col·lecció de sonates realitzada en vida de Domenico Scarlatti. No obstant això, el descobriment dels manuscrits de sonates existents a Saragossa, dut a terme pel Dr. José Vicente González Valle, ha permès disposar d’un nou fons documental d’especial transcendència per als investigadors. La present tesi doctoral, que suposa el primer treball realitzat sobre aquestes fonts espanyoles a nivell internacional, ha donat lloc a l’aflorament de noves dades inèdites; i conseqüentment, ha posat de manifest la necessitat de revisar algunes de les tesis assumides pels investigadors més rellevants sobre aquesta matèria. A partir del meu estudi, he arribat a la conclusió que els còdexs van poder ser originàriament propietat del compositor espanyol, d’origen aragonès, José de Nebra, que va estar més de quaranta anys al servei de la cort espanyola. La col·lecció de sonates de Saragossa tindria el seu origen a la possible relació existent entre D. Scarlatti i José de Nebra; músics que van coexistir en la cort des de 1733 (any en què Ferran VI i Maria Bàrbara de Bragança es van instal·lar definitivament a Madrid) fins a 1757 (any de la mort de D. Scarlatti). Considerant el nombre d’obres, l’origen dels manuscrits, els copistes que hi intervenen, la data primerenca de còpia de la música, i el valor musicològic de les versions contingudes, no hi ha cap dubte que la col·lecció de Saragossa és única a Espanya, situant-se al mateix nivell de les col·leccions de Venècia i Parma.\n\nTradicionalmente, se ha dado por supuesto que la difusión de la música de Domenico Scarlatti durante el siglo XVIII en España fue escasa. Se creía que la circulación de sus sonatas para teclado se circunscribió a la corte madrileña y a su área próxima de influencia, sobre todo, por dos motivos. El primero, por el hecho de que el número de copias manuscritas encontradas en los archivos españoles era reducido, algo que ha cambiado en los últimos años. El segundo, por el desconocimiento de que pudiera existir en España alguna gran colección de sonatas elaborada en vida de Domenico Scarlatti. No obstante, el hallazgo de los manuscritos de sonatas existentes en Zaragoza, llevado a cabo por el Dr. José Vicente González Valle, ha permitido disponer de un nuevo fondo documental de especial trascendencia para los investigadores. La presente tesis doctoral, que supone el primer trabajo realizado sobre estas fuentes españolas a nivel internacional, ha dado lugar al afloramiento de nuevos datos inéditos; y consecuentemente, ha puesto de manifiesto la necesidad de revisar algunas de las tesis dadas por sentadas por los investigadores más relevantes sobre esta materia. A través de mi estudio, he llegado a la conclusión de que los códices pudieron ser originariamente propiedad del compositor español, de origen aragonés, José de Nebra, quien estuvo más de cuarenta años al servicio de la corte española. La colección de sonatas de Zaragoza pudo tener su origen en la posible relación existente entre D. Scarlatti y José de Nebra; músicos que coexistieron en la corte desde 1733 (año en el que Fernando VI y María Bárbara de Braganza se instalaron definitivamente en Madrid) hasta 1757 (año de la muerte de D. Scarlatti). Considerando el número de obras contenidas, el origen de los manuscritos, los copistas que intervienen, la fecha temprana de copia de la música, y el valor musicológico de las versiones contenidas, no cabe duda alguna de que la colección de Zaragoza es única en España, situándose al mismo nivel de las colecciones de Venecia y Parma.\n\nIt has been traditionally believed that the diffusion of the music by Domenico Scarlatti during the 18th century in Spain was scarce. It has been taken for granted that diffusion of his sonatas for keyboard was limited to the circle of the court of Madrid and its nearest area of influence. This argument was sustained for a long time mainly because of two reasons. The first one, because the number of manuscript copies found in Spanish archives was small, something that has changed over the last years. The second one, because of the ignorance that there could exist a great collection of sonatas composed during the lifetime of Domenico Scarlatti in Spain. Nevertheless, the founding of a great corpus of sonatas in Saragossa by Dr. José Vicente González Valle, has meant the opening of a new and relevant line of research. In this sense, this doctoral thesis, which is the first work made about these Spanish sources on an international level, has allowed the outcoming of unpublished data; and consequently, has shown the need to revise some of the thesis put forward as true by the most relevant researchers on this field. During my investigation, I have reached the conclusion that the codexes could have been originally owned by the Spanish composer, of Aragon origin, José de Nebra, who served for over forty years for the Spanish court. The collection of sonatas from Saragossa could have its origin in the possible relationship between D. Scarlatti and José de Nebra; musicians who coexisted in the courtfrom 1733 (year when Fernando the sixth and María de Braganza definitely settled in Madrid) and seventeen-fifty-seven (year of the death of D. Scarlatti). Considering the number of works within, the origin of the manuscripts, the copyists that intervened, the early date of the copy of the music, and the musicological value of the versions, there is no doubt that the collection of Saragossa is unique in Spain, being at the same level of the collections of Venice and Parma\n\nCampbell, Alan Douglas. \"The binary sonata tradition in the mid-eighteenth century : bipartite and tripartite \"First halves\" in the Venice XIII collection of keyboard sonatas by Domenico Scarlatti.\" Thesis, McGill University, 2000. http://digitool.Library.McGill.CA:80/R/?func=dbin-jump-full&object_id=33275.\n\nFull text\n\nAbstract:\n\nComparatively few theoretical studies exist on the keyboard sonatas of Domenico Scarlatti. His music remains largely unexplored. This study investigates formal and functional aspects of the \"first halves\" in the Venice XIII collection (K 514--K 543) and reveals links to the aesthetics and traditions of his contemporaries. It suggests and examines relationships to the development of the sonata genre. To accomplish this, the study proposes a theoretical base for critical analysis and presents a specialised terminology to examine the features of mid-eighteenth-century sonata forms. The arguments of Michelle Fillion, J. P. Larsen, and Wilhelm Fischer are central to the discussion. Studies by William Caplin, Barbara Foster, Klaus Heimes, Ralph Kirkpatrick, and James Unger also contribute to the development of the theoretical base. An analysis section views the selected repertoire and some contemporary works according to the criteria the thesis establishes. An epilogue sums up pertinent observations made in the analysis section.\n\nTheodoropoulou, Marina. \"Alessandro Scarlatti - soprano cantatas : edition, commentary and recorded performances of the autograph cantatas in Yale University, Beinecke Rare Book and Manuscript Library, Osborn Music MS 2.\" Thesis, University of York, 2012. http://etheses.whiterose.ac.uk/3808/.\n\nFull text\n\nAbstract:\n\nThe current doctoral study uncovered and revived 28 autograph cantatas for Soprano and Basso Continuo composed between 1704 and 1705 by Alessandro Scarlatti (1660-1725). The studied cantatas are held in a manuscript containing 36 cantatas (one of which misses the beginning) in Yale University, Beinecke Rare Book and Manuscript Library, James Marshall and Marie-Louise Osborn Collection, Call Number: Osborn Music MS 2. The historical context in which the cantatas were written and performed is introduced. A physical description of the manuscript follows, with the aim to assist the reader in achieving a better appreciation and understanding of these cantatas in terms of performance practice. The relation between the text and the music, and the adaptation of the rhetorical characteristics of the text into music, are two of the most salient features of this cantata collection. These features are described in great detail and their implications for the performance of the cantatas have been explored. A major contribution of this study in the field of performance practice is the production of a modern performing edition with an editorial commentary and of a recording of the 28 autograph cantatas with harpsichord accompaniment.\n\nDuell, Trevor. \"The Use of the Trumpet in Early Seventeenth Century Spanish Music Dramas: A Comparative Analysis of Selected Works by Sebastián Durón, Joaquín Martínez de la Roca, and Alessandro Scarlatti.\" Thesis, University of North Texas, 2016. https://digital.library.unt.edu/ark:/67531/metadc955023/.\n\nFull text\n\nAbstract:\n\nThe purpose of this project is to conduct and analysis of the role and symbolism of the trumpet in two early eighteenth century Spanish music dramas: La Guerra de los Gigantes by Sebastian Duron and Los Desagravios de Troya by Joaquin Martinez de la Roca.\n\nHunt, Janet Evelyn. \"The Harpsichord Concertos of Wilhelm Friedemann Bach, a Lecture Recital, Together with Three Recitals of Selected Works of J.S.

Byrd, and Others.\" Thesis, University of North Texas, 1995. https://digital.library.unt.edu/ark:/67531/metadc278911/.\n\nFull text\n\nAbstract:\n\nThe harpsichord concertos of Wilhelm Friedemann Bach (1710-1784) have suffered undeserved neglect. The four authenticated solo concertos remain in manuscript, with the result that his contribution to the history of the keyboard concerto has been largely overlooked. This study begins to correct this situation by examining these four concertos--F41 in D Major, F43 in E Minor, F44 in F Major, and F45 in A Minor--as well as the published two-harpsichord Concerto in E-Flat Major, F46, and the incomplete Concerto in E-Flat Major, F42 in order to assess W. F. Bach's contribution to the keyboard concerto following its origins in the early 1700s. The results of this investigation show that W. F. Bach took the early keyboard concerto of his father's generation and added many of the characteristics which became associated with the mid-eighteenth century concerto. Friedemann retained the polyphonic interplay between tutti and solo, harmonic language, and tonal plan of his father's compositions and added a wealth of rhythmic ideas and a more modern melodic style. He worked within an established four ritornello/three solo plan for the outer movements, but employed a variety of formal plans for the middle movements. Friedemann heightened the contrast between the solo and the orchestra and infused the solo part with formidable virtuosity. At the same time he ensured that the solo and tutti material was related so that the two forces would work together while maintaining distinct identities. This study shows the high merit of W. F. Bach's harpsichord concertos and adds to another chapter in the history of the pre-Classical keyboard concerto.\n\nLively, Judy Sharon. \"Extra-Musical Associations in Selected Pieces From Années de Pélerinage, Troisième Année, by Franz Liszt: A Lecture Recital, Together with Three Recitals of Selected Works of D.

The pieces in volume three serve as a means of expressing a religious pilgrimage. The religiousmeaning is implied by the titles and by letters Liszt wrote concerning specific pieces. For the pieces to have programmatic significance, the music must support the verbal clues. This dissertation maintains that selected pieces in Annees de Pelerinage III are programmatic and that Liszt provided musical clues that have not been discovered or, if noticed, have not been analyzed in detail. Also, the dissertation explores similarities between selected pieces of Annees de Pelerinage III and other programmatic or texted works by Liszt sharing the same subject. The findings reinforce the premise that Liszt deliberately intended to express certain extra-musical ideas within the music itself. The paper briefly analyzes the musical reasons for labeling Annees de Pelerinaae III a cycle. Different sources call these pieces cyclic, citing the shared common religious theme as the reason. This dissertation discusses musical reasons that reinforce the idea of a cycle. Chapter II discusses Liszt's views on program music. Chapter III identifies common themes in Liszt's programmatic works and discusses the symbolic significance of thematic transformation. Chapter IV suggests an approach to analyzing program music. Chapter V discusses Liszt's musical narrative and his use of common rhetorical devices. Chapter VI analyzes extra-musical associations in selected pieces from the Annees de Pelerinaae—Troisieme Annee. Five pieces have been selected for analysis—Anaelus1.

These mélodies show the influence of the trend of salon music and the high-level poetry from the poetic movements of romanticism, Parnassianism, and symbolism. This study deals with Massenet's mélodies relating to the prosody idea, which is conspicuous in his vocal treatment. His melodic styles feature four distinct aspects of vocal treatment including lyrical, recitative or parlando, melodramatic, and déclamation rhythmée, and represent the idea of musical prosody of phonetic, syntactic, and semantic aspects. Massenet's other musical idioms such as harmony, form, and piano treatment, are also closely related to the prosody matter as a semantic aspect, reinforcing the poetic mood and content. In this study, each melodic style related to French versification is examined in detail. The musical analysis regarding the other musical idioms on selected examples presents the semantic feature of prosody idea. The brief review of French versification and opinions regarding the performance are included. Massenet's contribution to the genre of mélodie, with the prose melody and treatment of piano as an equal partner of voice line, is clearly demonstrated. With this contribution, Massenet should be recognized as the most influential composer to the climatic time of French mélodie led by Fauré, and Debussy, and Duparc.\n\nScarlat, Raul Cristian [Verfasser], Georg [Akademischer Betreuer] Heygster, Gunnar [Gutachter] Spreen, and Leif Toudal [Gutachter] Pedersen. \"Improving an optimal estimation algorithm for surface and atmospheric parameter retrieval using passive microwave data in the Arctic / Raul Cristian Scarlat ; Gutachter: Gunnar Spreen, Leif Toudal Pedersen ; Betreuer: Georg Heygster.\" Bremen : Staats- und Universitätsbibliothek Bremen, 2018. http://d-nb.info/1169299059/34.\n\nFull text\n\nPan-Yan, Qian-Fei, and 潘閻芊翡. \"The Analysis and Interpretation of Five Keyboard Sonatas by Domenico Scarlatti.\" Thesis, 2010. http://ndltd.ncl.edu.tw/handle/46938856938624038002.\n\nFull text\n\nAbstract:\n\n碩士\n\n台南科技大學\n\n音樂研究所\n\n98\n\nIn 1685, three great composers were born. In addition to the well-known J. S. Bach and Händel, there was also one composer—Domenico Scarlatti, who had composed 545 keyboard sonatas. Although Scarlatti was not born in Spain, his keyboard sonatas are filled with Spanish ethnic style. Guitar music is especially an important factor in his compositions— throughout his life. Furthermore, in his sonatas, D. Scarlatti utilized many keyboard techniques and skills that had almost surpassed the capacity of the harpsichord at that time, in which the gamut and the skill of harpsichord playing could be explored to an extreme, for example, long-distance jumping with hand-crossing, quick hand alternations during fast passages, repeating the same note swiftly, etc. In contemporary piano playing, such skills remain essential for advanced piano players, also the prerequisite skills for all the players. In the 18th Century, suites consisting of several pieces of dance music prevailed. However, Scarlatti titled his compositions as sonatas. As for the reason, by analyzing Scarlatti’s unique compositional methods, and musical forms in his sonatas, and compare them with 18th Century keyboard and violin suites, the author wishs to understand whether there is any correlation between his sonatas and the suites commonly-composed at that time in Baroque Period. The five keyboard sonatas by Scarlatti studied in this report are: “L. 413/ K. 9”, “L. 108/ K. 213”, “L. 422/ K. 141”, “L. 449/ K. 27”, and “L. 465/ K. 96”. These sonatas include many Spanish guitar music characteristics as well as the more difficult playing skills. Through formal analysis and the exploration of performance interpretation, these aspects can be better understood.\n\nHoug, Yin chi, and 洪瑩綺. \"From Baroque to Twenty Centry - analysis of music by Scarlatti、 Beethoven、Chopin and Barber.\" Thesis, 1997. http://ndltd.ncl.edu.tw/handle/36813468406802381034.\n\nFull text\n\nCAI, XIAWEI, and 蔡夏微. \"A Study on the Style in the Keyboard Sonatas by Domenico Scarlatti (1685-1757).\" Thesis, 2018. http://ndltd.ncl.edu.tw/handle/x86939.\n\nFull text\n\nAbstract:\n\n碩士\n\n東吳大學\n\n音樂學系\n\n107\n\nThe composer Domenico Scarlatti (1685-1757) who created 555 keyboard sonatas, opened up a new path for later composers with the advanced sense of innovation in the development of Western music history.

Este trabalho analisa a sua produção teórica e crítica, relacionando-os com a época da ascensão e consolidação do Estado Novo. Englobando as várias obras do autor, esta análise centra-se sobretudo em A Religião do Teatro, onde debateu a teoria de Friedrich Nietzsche em A Origem da Tragédia, como proposta de regeneração do teatro, e no conjunto das suas críticas de espectáculos publicadas no jornal O Diabo. Embora os seus escritos sejam frequentemente citados por investigadores que estudam a época, a obra de Scarlatti, em si, permanecia até hoje sem investigação. Devido a uma exiguidade da documentação biográfica, este estudo procura identificar e descrever as ideias principais do autor, no que concerne ao diagnóstico que faz ao teatro do seu tempo, assim como as soluções que propõe com vista a uma reforma. Procura ainda traçar uma relação entre estas ideias e o ambiente de repressão ao livre-pensar que então se viveu. Pretende-se também demonstrar que o autor viu como maiores problemas do teatro a intromissão do científico e a influência do ultra-romantismo, foi contra a proposta do fim da palavra e do autor, e procurou a harmonia entre um teatro de ideias e um teatro trágico. Nessa forma de drama e na figura do génio artístico depositou a esperança de uma regeneração social.\n\nABSTRACT: Eduardo Scarlatti (1898-1990), critic and theorist of the portuguese theatre, contributed prominently to the actualization of the dramatic practice between 1925 and 1945. This work analyses his theoretical and critic production, relating it with the epoch of the rising and consolidation of Estado Novo. Encompassing the author’s several works, this study centers itself mainly in A Religião do Teatro (The Religion of Theatre), where he debated Friedrich Nietzsche’s theory of The Birth of Tragedy, as a proposal of theatre’s regeneration, and in the bulk of his critics published in the newspaper O Diabo. Although his writings are often quoted by researchers studying the period in question, Scarlatti’s work remained itself unresearched. Due to an exiguity of biographical documentation, this study sought to identify and describe the author’s main ideas, regarding the diagnosis he makes of his time’s theatre, as well as the solutions he propounds with a view to a reform. It searches, still, to draw a relation between these ideas and the then lived environment of repression to free-thinking. Furthermore, it is intended to demonstrate that, as the biggest problems of theatre, the author saw the intrusion of the scientific and the influence of ultra-romanticism, he was against the proposal of the end of word and author, and sought the harmony between a theatre of ideas and a tragic theatre. In this form of drama, and in the figure of the artistic genius, he placed the hope of a social regeneration."
