        "text": "The roots of Baroque reach back to late Renaissance composers, such as the development of monody by such as Giulio Caccini in association with the Florentine Camerata, a group of humanist intellectuals, about the cusp of the 16th century. The term \"baroque\" is derived of \"barocco\" meaning a pearl of irregular shape in Portuguese. This page is structured differently from the other YouTube histories. Due that specific dates are largely impossible with early classical music we keep the convention of indexing songs by alphabetical order only. That is, they are not in chronological order. Dates are noted by appendage and refer the year of publication if not composition. As for brackets (: [Part 1]), they indicate sections made by YouTube channels. If the composer you're seeking isn't on this page he may be in Renaissance or Classical. Several late Baroque composers are in Classical if they bridged at all. As \"baroque\" suggests, things begin to get a little complicated during that period in a literal number of ways, that is, per cataloguing systems [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6], particularly thematic, as chronological is for a large part simply not possible [see also 1, 2]. Which brings us to opus numbers, the practice beginning circa 1600 perhaps as an alternative to incipits (the titling of songs by their first few words). As both publishers and composers themselves began to assign op numbers for various purposes, the practice led to such confusion that cataloguing systems became requisite to clarity some sort of sequence and establish universally agreeable standards. As for baroque composers, a good companion to this section is 'Greene's Biographical Encyclopedia of Composers' by David Mason Greene & Constance Green (Doubleday 1985): 1, 2. See also: baroque.org; operabaroque; 'A History of Baroque Music' by George Buelow (Indiana U Press 2004) *; 'Musical Authorship from SchÃ¼tz to Bach' by Stephen Rose (Cambridge U Press 2019) *; 'Baroque Music' by Peter Walls (Routledge 2017) *. See also Stanford University's list of opera composers and Opera Glass. As the history of classical music is largely European until its later arrival to the United States in the 19th century, helpful in the use of this account may be chronological maps of Europe and its monarchs mentioned throughout [1, 2, 3, 4]. The earliest major European temporal power to which this history refers throughout is the Roman Catholic Church and the Papal States. Much of the history of Europe is likewise that of the Holy Roman Empire (HRE) from the 9th to the 19th centuries [1, 2, 3; HMEA]. France was a major player alongside the Church in medieval music prior to the Renaissance and became the major European check to the HRE. Venice didn't acquire a lot of territory but became a major cultural center during the Renaissance alike Italy of which it became a part in 1866. Other European nations important to these histories include in alphabetical order Austria, England [GB UK: 1, 2], Germany, Poland [1, 2], Prussia [1, 2], Russia and Spain. Also much affecting European music was northern Europe or, Scandinavia [1, 2, 3], particularly as an adversarial check to Russia. Quick dates for monarchs and popes: 1, 2, 3, 4. See also America [1, 2]. Born 8 Oct in 1551 in Italy, Giulio Caccini was the elder brother of sculptor, Giovanni Caccini, and father to Baroque composer, Francesca Caccini. The Baroque period [1, 2] is generally considered to commence in 1600 AD to stretch well beyond 100 years into 18th century. This history begins the Baroque with Giulio Caccini per his later publication of 'Le Nuove Musiche' ('The New Music') in 1602 [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8]. Containing 12 madrigals and 10 arias, the notable 'Le Nuove Musiche' presented some of the earliest examples of Baroque composition. Giulio had studied lute, viol and harp as a child in Rome. Some time during the sixties Grand Duke Francesco de' Medici brought him to Florence to study music there. Thought to have begun composing about 1570, by 1579 he was employed as a tenor vocalist at the Medici court. During Caccini's years with the Medici family he became involved with the Florentine Camerata [1, 2], a group of humanists, intellectuals, musicians and poets who oft met at the home of Count Giovanni de' Bardi. Another important member of that sphere was Caccini's older contemporary in Florence, Vincenzo Galilei, father to the astronomer, Galileo [*] the latter born when Caccini was 12 years old in 1564. Such the setting in which Caccini became a teacher in great demand during the eighties. Caccini spent his entire career in Florence with the exception of one brief trip to Rome as secretary for the Count in 1592 (following the death of Galilei in '91). Caccini then discovered that his own music was not disliked there, though Rome belonged to Palestrina at the time. Nor did Caccini's music spread throughout Europe as well as Palestrina's. Florence, however, was Caccini's ground w the Florentine Camerata his greater circle. Among the principle concerns of the Florentine Camerata were ancient Greek drama and music. Another member of that group was the slightly younger contemporary of Caccini's, Jacopo Peri, generally credited with having written the first opera, 'Dafne', in 1597. Three days after Peri premiered 'Euridice' on 6 October 1600 in Florence, Caccini's 'Il rapimento di Cefalo' ('The Abduction of Cephalus') was performed on 9 October 1600 before 3800 guests at the wedding of King Henri IV of France and Marie de' Medeci, that in Florence as well. Most of that opera is lost. Be as may, after publishing 'Le Nuove Musiche' mentioned above in July of 1602, Caccini staged his own version of 'Euridice' at the Pitti Palace in Florence on 5 December 1602. In 1614 he published 'Nuove Musiche e Nuova Maniera di Scriverle'[1, 2], another book of madrigals containing 36 songs. Caccini died on 10 Dec 1618. As indicated, among his main contributions to the wane of the Renaissance and early cusp of the Baroque [1, 2] was music theory, such as the development of monody in association with the Florentine Camerata exemplified in 'Le Nuove Musiche' below. Though Caccini died just as the Baroque was beginning to leaf, the period itself would extend another hundred years into the eighteenth century. References: 1, 2, 3. Compositions: 1, 2. Scores.

Though he wrote secular works sacred music was his main concern. He was nephew to composer, Andrea Gabrieli, who may or may not have helped raised him, though likely mentored him. Albeit unknown, being related to Andrea may have found him composing at least as a student by 1570 as a teenager. He later studied with Orlande de Lassus in Munich where he remained until about 1579. 1584 found Gabrieli in Venice where he became lead organist at Saint Mark's Basilica in 1585. He would remain at Saint Mark's the remainder of his life, as well as at the Church of Saint Roch where he was also principal organist. Among Gabrieli's more illustrious accomplishments was his volume of motets, 'Sacrae Symphoniae' [audio], published in 1597 and gaining him his hour of power throughout Europe. 'Sacra Symphonia' contained the first two sonatas to which this history arrives: the 'Sonata pian e forte' Ch. 175 [1, 2, 3] and 'Sonata octavi toni a 12' Ch. 184 [1, 2, 3]. It is thought the sonata [1, 2, 3, 4] was first called such in 1561 (\"sonare\" = Italian for \"to sound\") to distinguish an instrumental piece for lute from a cantata, that is, song. The sonata, however, wouldn't develop into a major vehicle for another eighty to hundred years via Baroque composers such as Arcangelo Correlli and Johann Kuhnau when two kinds of it began to appear: the sonata da chiesa (church sonata) and the sonata da camera (chamber sonata). Be as may, the sonata's first treatment in literature wasn't until 1710, appearing in Brossard's 'Dictionaire de Musique' that year. As for Gabrieli, about 1606, nine years after publishing 'Sacra Symphonia', he fell too ill to work, appointing deputies to execute what he couldn't. He died on 12 August 1612 due to a kidney stone. Among posthumous publications arrived 'Canzoni e Sonate' [*] in 1615 containing 'Sonata XVIII' [*]. Also published that year were ''Sonata XXI: Con Tre Violini' Ch. 214 [1, 2] and 'Sacrae Symphoniae Liber Secundus' [*]. References for Gabrieli: 1, 2. Compositions: 1, 2, 3,. Scores.

As dates vary between sources, data herein is based on a birthdate of circa 1570 for Raffaella Aleotti [1, 2] and circa 1574 for Vittoria Aleotti [1, 2, 3, 4, 5], making Pasquini perhaps 18 years old upon discovering four-year old Vittoria to be especially talented while teaching her older sister, Raffaella [1, 2]. Pasquini is thought to have been mentored by teacher alike to the Aleotti girls, Alessandro Milleville [*]. Pasquini may have remained in service to Aleotti throughout the eighties. In 1592 Pasquini acquired employment at the Benedictine church of Santa Maria in Verona. In 1593 Aleotti published two books of music by his daughters, a volume of motets by Rafaella and a book of madrigals by Vittoria. Rafaella's work, thought to be earliest known compositions by a nun to see print, included two motets by Pasquini along with a dedication to him and Milleville. That same year Pasquini published his poetic favola (fable) in five acts, 'I fidi amanti' ('The Faithful Lovers'), toward the marriage the next year of Don Carlo Gesualdo and his patroness, Eleonora d'Este [*]. Some time before 1597 he succeeded Luzzasco Luzzaschi as organist of the Accademia della Morte in Ferrara, after which he accepted an appointment as organist at St. Peter's Basilica in Rome. He simultaneously held a similar position at Santo Spirito in Sassia in 1604. Pasquini is known to have been residing at a hospital for the mentally abnormal in 1605. In 1606 Pasquini was fired from his bench at St. Peter's for unclear cause, though likely due to a mental condition described in no greater detail then \"crazy\" in so many words. He was apparently rehired until an incident in May 1608 - leaving his organ to approach and speak to the Pope - got him dismissed for good. He was replaced by Alessandro Costantini from June through October, succeeded by Girolamo Frescobaldi after that [1605-08 *]. Biological record of Pasquini disappears henceforth, though he may have lived to as late as 1619. His last composition, 'Jesu decus angelicum', for four voices and organ, may or may not have been published posthumously in Fabio Constatini's 'Scelta di Motetti' in 1618 [*]. Ten toccatas, canzonas and Romanesche were copied posthumously into 'Il Libro di Fra Gioseffo da Ravenna' (I-RAc Ms 545) probably by Benedictine Giuseppe Rasino c 1630-40. Though not known when composed, they are of interest in the development of baroque alongside titles by such as Andrea Gabrieli and Frescobaldi. They are Pasquini's toccatas, canzonas and Romanesche which find him of interest in the development of baroque composition [*]. Pasquini left behind no great volume of works, some thirty pieces for keyboard and several for voice his major haul. References: 1, 2. Compositions: 1, 2.

Though a minor composer, his place in the late Renaissance is established by being credited with writing the first opera, 'Dafne', composed in 1597 to premiere in 1598. Baroque and opera (musical drama) broke out of the gate at about the same time in Europe, both in Italy and both in Peri. Peri was about eleven when he left Rome for Florence to enter into the Servite Santissima Annunziata monastery to become a singer. Sometime afterward he studied w Cristofano Malvezzi [*], the latter who may have attended the first meeting of the humanist Florentine Camerata [1, 2] on 14 January 1573 at the home of Giovanni de' Bardi, Count of Vernio. \"Humanism\" didn't get coined as a term until the early 19th century by theologian, Friedrich Niethammer, in reference to education based on classical systems (: ancient Greece). Thus humanism had been about in one way or another, without an identity, since the 13th century. The importance of humanism which peered back to Greek philosophy and scholastics was one of the defining characteristics of the Renaissance into which latter period Peri had been born. The dome of St. Peter's Basilica [1, 2, 3, 4], designed by Michelangelo Buonarroti, et al, as of 1546 and completed in 1590, had for inspiration the dome of the Florence Cathedral [1, 2] designed after Hadrian's Roman Pantheon [1, 2, 3, 4] constructed from 118 to 125 AD. Hadrian's Pantheon (extant) was a redesign of General Agrippa's about 27 BC under Emperor Augustus, that dedicated to the pantheon (all or complete) of Greco-Roman gods. The building of the dome to the Florence Cathedral affected the incipit of the Renaissance in architecture insofar as its original design by Neri di Fioravanti in 1367 had sparked a rejection of the Gothic flying buttress in favor of returning to the classic Roman dome as free-standing architecture. The genius of Filippo Brunelleschi had won the dome's final design in 1418. With its completion in 1436 the Renaissance-to-come had fairly rang its first bell in Florence. The completion of St. Peter's in 1590 when Peri was about 29 years of age fairly marks the crowning culmination of the Renaissance as the calendar turned baroque. Peri had studied w Malvezzi sometime in the seventies during which time he sang at multiple churches. He was hired as an organist at the Badia Florentina, an abbey and church, in 1579. His most prestigious position arrived with the House of Medici come 1588. Both a singer and keyboard player for the Medicis, he also composed madrigals, which originated in Italy and were the dominant style of secular vocal music in Europe at Peri's time. He also wrote incidental music for plays, and intermedi (intermezzi), that is, intermissions between acts of plays that featured some or other sort of musical performance. During the nineties Peri began associating with Jacopo Corsi and the Florentine Camerata. In 1597 Peri, Corsi and poet, Ottavio Rinuccini, collaborated on the creation of 'Dafne' to premiere in 1598. Two years later Peri and Rinuccini premiered 'Euridice' [1, 2, 3] on 6 October 1600. 'Il Rapimento di Cefalo' [1, 2, 3] followed three days later on 9 October, with music by Giulio Caccini and libretto by Gabriello Chiabrera, making that the third known opera after Peri's. Peri's significance to baroque was in his conservative monodies for solo voice accompanied by no more than basso continuo. Monteverdi took both note and monody to greater fame. Peri died in Florence on 12 August 1633. References: 1, 2, 3, 4. Audio (samples vocal works). Discographies: 1, 2, 3. IA. Other profiles: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5.

Baptized on 15 May 1567 in Cremona, Italy, Claudio Monteverdi was already in his thirties when baroque composition and instrumentation became a branch of exploration in Italy, Monteverdi among its advance guard. As a younger contemporary to Giulio Caccini, Monteverdi was destined to take baroque to such a full and flush splendor that \"early Baroque\" and \"Monteverdi\" are nigh interchangeable. Monteverdi was a gamba (viol) player who studied at the University of Cremona, his first employment as a musician at the Cathedral of Cremona in the choir. Composing seriously as an adolescent, 'Sacrae cantiunculae' was his first published volume of songs in 1582, an assemblage of sacred motets and madrigals. In 1590 he was hired by Vincenzo Gonzaga, Duke of Mantua, with whom he moved up from singer and violist to court composer. In 1607 Monteverdi composed 'L'Orfeo', among the earliest operas nine years after what is considered the first, Jacopo Peri's 'Dafne' having premiered in 1598. 1613 found Monteverdi composing as choir master at the basilica in San Marco. By 1632 Monteverdi had become a priest, sacred music to follow. Among his last works before his death on 29 Nov 1643 was the opera, 'L'incoronazione di Poppea' ('The Coronation of Poppea') in 1642. He'd written some eighteen operas, but only 'L'Orfeo', 'Lamento' (an aria from 'L'Arianna'), 'Il ritorno d'Ulisse in Patria' ('The Return of Ulysses') and 'L'incoronazione di Poppea' have survived. Monteverdi's operas aside, his most important works were his earlier books of madrigals, the fifth in 1605 ('Il quinto libro de madrigali a cinque voci') considered his most significant in the development of baroque, occasioning his discussion of counterpoint and prima pratica [*] versus seconda pratica [1, 2, 3] in his introduction.

The musical Renaissance into the wane of which Praetorius was born had been a considerably Catholic or secular affair, not so grand in Germany as it had been next door in France or over the Alps in Italy, nor even in England across the Channel which experienced some degree of isolation from the Continent during the Reformation as well. Relevantly, the Strait of Dover (English Channel) is only about 21 miles across and could be sailed on a good day in three or so hours. Though the gap between Dover and Calais in France was short enough to encourage both commerce and assault, the Channel nevertheless served as a natural moat when not contested. Howsoever, Praetorius studied divinity, languages, music and philosophy at the University of Frankfurt beginning in 1582 at age eleven. Music likely included composing. He also spent a period at the Lateinschule at Zerbst / Anhalt before graduating from Frankfurt in 1587, upon which he became organist at the Marienkirche in 1587. From thereon and throughout his twenties Praetorius led an itinerant life as an organ specialist, both performing as well as consulting (repair and such). He worked for numerous churches and aristocrats during the last 13 years of the 16th century, among them Henry Julius, Duke of Brunswick-LÃ¼neburg, possibly as early as 1592 [1595 per Zachary Alley]. His journeys from place to place had also made him a well-known composer by the turn of the century. He set 'Es ist ein Ros entsprungen' to music in 1609, an anonymous hymn first appearing in the 'Speyer Psalter' of 1599. Known in English as 'Lo, how a rose e'er blooming', that was a Lutheran Christmas carol, \"Ros\" (Rose) symbolizing the Virgin Mary. The importance of Mary in the liturgical music of the Catholic Church has been noted long since. But before getting too far ahead, Praetorius' hymn behooves us to note the Christmas carol [1, 2, 3, 4] which place is huge in the music of Western civilization. \"Carol\" is Anglo-French for \"choraule\" (choral song) in Latin. Though modern Christmas carols include not a few of secular variety that are famous, such as Irving Berlin's 'White Christmas' of 1942, the most throughout the centuries were in praise, of course, of Christ. One carol, 'Angelâs Hymn', is traced back to 129 AD when Roman Bishop, Telesphous, ordained the song to be sung at midnight on Christmas Eve [1, 2, 3, 4]. Its chorus, \"Gloria in Excelsis Deo!,\" is thought to have passed its way through the centuries to be combined with verses from the French carol of unknown origin, 'Les Anges dans Nos Campagnes', to finally arrive in 1862 as 'Angels We Have Heard on High' [*] with lyrics translated by John Chadwick sung to the tune of 'Gloria in Excelsis Deo!' (not Bach's later cantata) [*]. Christmas and its observance with carols would be outlawed for a time in the 17th century both in Cromwell's England from 1644/47 to 1660 [1, 2] and in American New England from 1659 to 1681 [1, 2, 3]. Other than that the practice too resembled that by Roman Catholics, another reason for the ban was that the date of December 25 had been that of the pagan holiday, Saturnalia, not the actual birthdate of Jesus. There was also issue w people taking the day off from work. As for Praetorius, back a little earlier in 1602 he composed a collection of fourteen Magnificat settings while in Regensburg that saw later publishing in 1611 in a volume called 'Megalynodia Sionia' [1, 2, 3]. He was made Kapellmeister to Henry Julius (above) in 1604. From 1605 to 1610 he published his 9-part 'Musae Sioniae'. 'Musarum Sioniarum: motectae et psalmi latini' appeared in their midst in 1607 [1, 2]. This is thought to contain the first sacred motets, 52 of them, written in style baroque. In addition to the liturgical 'Megalynodia Sionia' in 1611 Praetorius published 'Missodia Sionia' [1, 2], 'Hymnodia Sionia' [1, 2] and 'Eulogodia Sionia' [1, 2] the same year. In 1612 he published 'Terpsichore' [1, 2, 3], a collection of 312 dances for four instruments consisting of bransle, courantes, voltes, ballets and gaillarde. Upon the death of Henry Julius in 1613 Praetorius remained with his successor, Frederick Ulrich. He was also employed by John George I, Elector of Saxony, in 1613. Though already familiar with the Venetian School, he there studied Venetian style which led to his accredited creation of the chorale concerto (not) that would lead to the later chorale cantatas of JS Bach. Other important composers of the chorale concerto were Praetorius' close contemporaries, Samuel Scheidt [*] and Johann Hermann Schein [*]. From 1615 to 1620 Pratorius published three volumes of 'Syntagma musicum' [1, 2, 3], a prose work addressing the reconstruction of musical instruments and their use in Lutheran liturgy. Come 'Polyhymnia Caduceatrix & Panegyrica' ('Hymns of Peace and Praise') in 1619 [1, 2]. Praetorius' published 'Puericinium' [1, 2] in 1621, a collection of 14 motet settings for multiple choirs. That may have been published before his death on his fiftieth birthday on 15 Feb of 1621. Praetorius had been a highly prolific composer, completing no less then twelve hundred chorale and song arrangements, his 312 instrumental dances in 'Terpischore' and numerous other works for the Lutheran church. Along the way he was a major figure in the introduction to Protestant Germany of the \"new music\" that was the baroque surfacing in Catholic Italy.

His father was Vincenzo Galilei and his older brother was the astronomer, Galileo Galilei [*]. In 1593 he went to Poland, likely to play lute for the RadziwiÅÅ family. Poland had had a Renaissance of its own, though a bit out of the way. Returning to Florence in 1599 to apply at the court of Ferdinando I de' Medici, Grand Duke of Tuscany, one assumes that composition or arrangements were among such as Galilei was concerned to present to Ferdinando, in vain, for he was back in Poland in 1600. In 1607 he obtained an honorable court position in Munich with Holy Roman Elector, Maximilian I of Bavaria [*]. Galilei remained in Munich, a principal cultural hot spot in Germany, the remainder of his life. It was 1620 when Galilei published his book of lute pieces, 'Il primo libro d'intavolatura di liuto' [*]. Galilei rose to no great prominence in greater Europe before dying in Munich 3 Jan 1631. Holding principle residencies in Poland and Munich, however, meant a time of regional prestige. Galilei had composed mostly dances like galliards, voltas (voltes), courantes and passamezzos.

By the time Giulio Caccini published 'The New Music' in Florence in 1602 Frescobaldi was about nineteen years of age. Frescobaldi's father was a property owner whose son studied under Luzzasco Luzzaschi in Ferrara before leaving for Rome.Numerous sources have Frescobaldi admitted to the Accademia (Congregation) di St. Cecilia in 1604 where he may have sung and played organ. Such, however, is speculative. Frescobaldi's presence in Rome isn't confirmable until 1607 when he was hired on as an organist at Santa Maria. He was also employed by the Archbishop of Rhodes, with whom he made his only journeys beyond Italy, traveling to Flanders and Antwerp. In 1608 Frescobaldi succeeded Ercole Pasquini as organist at St. Peter's Basilica in Rome, which position he held intermittently until his death. Between 1610 and 1613 Frescobaldi began working for Cardinal Pietro Aldobrandini, keeping that position until 1631. In 1614 Frescobaldi had been hired by the Duke of Mantua. But he found the people \"cold\" and lasted only about five months, that leading to his publishing of 'Toccate e partite d'intavolatura' [*] the next year in Rome. 'Partita sopra l'aria della Romanesca' arrived in 1616 [1, 2]. Moving ahead into the twenties, Frescobaldi published his second volume [1, 2] of 'Toccate e partite d'intavolatura' in 1927. He is thought to have published 'Il primo libro delle Canzoni' [*] in Rome in 1928 before heading to Florence the same year to serve the Grand Duke of Tuscany. He published two important books of arias there in 1630. Rome again exerted its pull in 1634 when Pope Urban VIII offered him a position at St. Peters. He simultaneously found himself employed by Cardinal Francesco Barberini as well. In 1635 he published his 'Fiori musicali'. Frescobaldi died on 1 March 1643 only about ten months the same year before his major rival in Venice, Monteverdi. Frescobaldi wrote no operas as did Monteverdi, his a mastery of instrumental composition, for keyboard especially, authoring canzonas, motets, toccatas, partitas (simply instrumental tunes), capriccios (caprices, usually lively in free form and often virtuosic) and fantasias (improvisational at first but developing more rigid forms over the years).

Caccini's first known performance as a singer was in 1600 at the wedding of Henry IV of France and Maria de Medici. She is thought to have begun composing shortly thereafter, a piece called 'La Stiava', written for Carnival in 1607, among her earliest works. By the time she published 'La Tancia' in 1613, Caccini was in her element, working for the Medici's as a singer, teacher and composer much of scores for stage (opera, she a young woman while opera was being developed [with assistance from her father, Giulio Caccini] and beginning to catch). She followed 'La Tancia' with 'Il Passatempo' in 1614, 'Il primo libro delle musiche' in 1618 and 'La Fiera' in 1619. 'La liberazione di Ruggiero' was published in 1625, written for Prince Ladislaus Sigismondo visiting from Poland. Caccini is documented to have left the Medicis (permanently) in 1641, at which point she disappears from history, perhaps dying that year. Few works by Caccini have survived. Though her operas hadn't the magnificence of Monteverdi's, she otherwise left behind an admirable anthology of vocal pieces, especially solos and duets. What scores of hers survive indicate she was notably more the perfectionist with ink and paper than the average composer. References: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6. Audio samples: 1, 2. Scores: 1, 2.

Their father, Thomas Lawes, was a vicar choral (professional singer) at Salisbury Cathedral. Among composers on this page William owns the distinction, unlike Henry, of not having published any of his works. Both were tutored by John Cooper (aka Giovanni Coprario) who acquainted them w early Italian baroque method. Though the brothers employed baroque method such as basso continuo in their music neither are known so much for baroque as for their areas of expertise in general. Albeit both wrote vocal works Henry is especially noted for those, particularly his songs. Though both wrote instrumentals William is especially noted for those, particularly his consorts. The spiritual climate into which the Lawes brothers were born was Puritan, that is, Anglican with purification from Roman Catholicism its purpose, one good reason for 102 such Puritans, also called Pilgrims, to distance themselves from Europe by boarding the 'Mayflower' to arrive at the Colony of Virginia [*] in 1620. There had been prior aborted attempts to colonize America, and Virginia had been chartered and settled earlier in 1606 and 1607, but they are the passengers of the 'Mayflower' credited with making Virginia America's first permanent colony. The spiritual climate back in Europe on the continent was such that the Dominican friar, Bruno [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6], had been executed in Rome only two years before Lawes' birth for believing in the possibility of multiple worlds in an infinite cosmos. It didn't require the Church a mathematical grasp of infinity, concerning which there is no center, to recognize that the Church wasn't the center of Bruno's reality, though it became such soon upon his conviction of heresy, thereupon stripped and hung upside-down on a stake for burning alive, his ashes tossed into the Tiber. There were multiple realities far and wide on Lawes' own globe during his era. Egypt was approaching a millennium of Muslim Ottoman rule by the time Lawes was born, not many there for whom Rome was at the center of things. The Church had been troubled anywhere and everywhere constantly since the emergence of Protestantism via Luther [*] in 1517. The PolishâSwedish War of 1600-1611 [*] was fought during Lawes' childhood. Poles and Swedes once allied against Russian threat now had the concerns of two opposing faiths mixed into their helter-skelter on Earth. Lawes, too, would arrive to a reality centered in war. Lawes found early patronage in Edward Seymour, 1st Earl of Hertford, who found a teacher for him in composer, John Cooper (aka Coprario) circa 1619, composition no doubt among his studies. In 1635 he was appointed a lute player and singer to the court of King Charles I. Lawes remained with Charles until his, Lawes', early death in 1645. Throughout the history of music in Europe, for a musician to acquire some position at some royal court was to arrive to the peak, there nowhere higher to go. Except in Lawes' case, whose chariot swung low during the English Civil War between Charles, et al, and Parliament from 1642 to 1651, monarchial England the loser following Charles' death in '49. Having joined the Royalist cause as among the king's Guard, Lawes was taken home during the Battle of Rowton Heath, shot to death on 24 September 1645. References: 1, 2, 3, 4. Audio samples: 1, 2.

The list below features a couple airs [1, 2], fantasias and pavans.

(John Dowland had published 'First Booke of Songs or Ayres' in 1597.) 'Consort Set a 6 in G minor' is an air. The fantasia had been around for three quarters of a century by the time Lawes was born. It was originally composed to accommodate improvisation, a fantasy what one called a piece that had no particular form, but developed various forms over time. The pavan (pavane) was a stately slow-tempo dance, such as 'Consort Set a 5 in F' below, which had originated in Venice about a decade before the fantasy.\n\nWilliam Lawes\n\nConsort Set a 5 in F\n\nPhantasm\n\nOrgan: Daniel Hyde\n\nConsort Set a 6 in B flat major\n\nJordi Savall\n\nConsort Set a 6 in G minor\n\nPhantasm\n\nOrgan: Daniel Hyde\n\nDivisions on a Pavan in G Minor\n\nRose Consort of Viols\n\nOrgan: Timothy Roberts\n\nFantasia for 6 viols\n\nThe Orpheon Consort\n\nGather ye rosebuds\n\nSoprano: Suzie LeBlanc\n\nHarp Consort n 8\n\nIl Caleidoscopio\n\nBaptized in Marino on 18 April 1605, Giacomo Carissimi had a barrel maker for a father. Alexander Carpenter at AllMusic has him surfacing from an obscure youth at age eighteen in the choir at the Tivoli Cathedral, becoming an organist at age nineteen. The New World Encyclopedia has him in Assisi at age twenty where he became a chapel master. One could think he was composing by at least that time. He later assumed the same position at the church of Sant'Apollinare in Rome in 1628 and remained there the rest of his life. He became a priest in 1637. Among Carissimi's contributions to the Baroque period was the development of the oratorio, 'Jephte' of 1648 regarded his finest [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]. The oratorio is basically an opera without theatrical drama, for the ear rather than eye. An oratorio could be fashioned into an opera, or if you removed theatre from opera you could get an oratorio. Its subject matter was sacred as compared to opera which concern was usually historical or mythological due its origins in association with humanist intelligentsia (Greek monody). The oratorio probably became common as a term due that they were early performed at the Oratory of Santissimo Crocifisso in Rome. Like opera, oratorios were intended to be grand with soloists backed by powerful choirs and numerous instruments grouped in orchestras (Latin \"orchestra\" from Greek). In addition to oratorios Carissimi wrote cantatas and his parody mass included in MS 1177 in 1672, 'Sciolto Havean Dall'Alte Sponde' [1, 2]. A parody mass can be a secular caricature of a mass, but it was originally a piece of nonliturgical sacred music made to imitate the liturgical mass. The parody mass was nothing new. Palestrina had composed about fifty of them in the 16th century. Carissimi's 'Missa Sciolto Havean' was a parody of his earlier cantata of no later than 1653, 'Sciolto Havean Dall'Alte Sponde'.

Baroque was yet largely an Italian phenomenon during Tunder's time, but what the Roman Church had been to the Renaissance the Lutheran Church would be to high Baroque of JS Bach. Bach, however, wasn't born until 1685, eighteen years after Tunder's death. Tunder had became court organist to Duke Frederick III of Holstein-Gottorp [*] in 1632, age eighteen. He had studied a few years earlier in Italy. in 1641 he became head organist at St. Mary's Lutheran church in LÃ¼beck. In 1647 his position was enlarged to administrator and treasurer as well. Tunder worked in that capacity for the next twenty years until his death on 5 Nov 1667.

By the time Froberger was born early medieval music had reached to a peak in France with the building of Notre Dame circa 1200 (yet in construction). With the intentional study of music among Notre Dame's purposes, being associated with the University of Paris, composing quickly became a sophisticated craft. Troubadours, meanwhile, were traveling about from one estate to the next throughout France. Seeking patronage from royal courts for secular music led to the Burgundian school followed by the Franco-Flemish school in the Low Countries, of which the Renaissance burgeoned in combination with humanism, the latter a scholastic revival of matters classical, that is, largely ancient Greece. As the Renaissance arrived to its greatest muscle in the Roman and Venetian schools Germany arrived to its own cultural Renaissance despite the mindset of Luther's Reformation more concerned with matters Biblical than Greek. Though far away Poland had had its Renaissance as well, Russia even more distant remained largely an observer of matters European. As the term implies, the Renaissance was a bloom of many parts both sacred and secular. Another of its more obvious divisions had been wrought by the Reformation, making it a Catholic Renaissance in southern Europe stretching from Spain to Venice, and a Protestant Renaissance in embattled (contrapuntal, say) northern Europe. Catholics and Protestants, however, weren't the only in the land with an interest in temporal power. Nigh anywhere there was an aristocrat or royal court there was trouble as well, all from counts to dukes to emperors preferring to wield a relatively absolute power on Earth. Among the endless omnipresent arguments between monarchical powers was the Thirty Years War [1, 2, 3, 4], among the deadliest in European history which began on 23 May 1618, four days after Froberger's second birthday. Stuttgart, where he was born, was situated midway between two of that war's main belligerents, France and Bavaria, that is, France and its allies, principally Dutch and Swedish, versus the Habsburg Holy Roman Empire that included, especially, Bavaria and Spain, and was allied with the Roman papacy. Stuttgart was located in present day Baden-WÃ¼rttemberg (belonging to Habsburg Spain) with France its western border and Bavaria (belonging to Habsburg Austria) its eastern. As the Thirty Years War didn't cease until 25 May of 1648 Froberger would have ineluctably experienced, been witness to and begun composing in the midst of the countless miseries of that contest. From three to more than eleven million were killed during the three decades of that struggle. The population in Germany was reduced by 25 to 40 percent. During the more peaceful year of Froberger's birth in 1616 his father was kapellmeister to the WÃ¼rttemberg court and had a library which included above a hundred books of music. To own a book at Froberger's time in Germany was to have money. Gutenberg had invented the printing press about 1450 but a book was yet an expensive thing to buy, something beyond the means of the common Joe. Though probably safe to say that Froberger didn't have to learn how to drive a wagon as a child, what with thirty years worth of corpses to cart around, his education as a youth is otherwise speculative. Little is certain concerning Froberger until 1637, when he and his brother, Isaac, sold their father's library upon the latter's death of plague which took their mother and a sister as well. A more positive event arrived that year upon obtaining employmant as an organist in Vienna. Granted a stipend to study under Frescobaldi in Rome, Froberger spent the next three years in Italy before returning to Vienna in 1641, both a Catholic and composer now if not before. He there worked as an organist and chamber musician before returning to Italy in 1645 to study music under the Jesuit polymath, Athanasius Kircher, in Rome. He returned to Vienna in 1649, there to present Holy Roman Emperor, Ferdinand III, with his completed 'Libro Secundo' [IMSLP], a volume of 24 pieces divided into four chapters containing six each of toccatas, suites, fantasias and canzonas. But the death of Empress Maria Leopoldine, she a brief wife at age seventeen, left a climate on things such that Froberger left Vienna to spend the next few years traveling Europe from Germany to the Low Countries to London. He may have been employed, as well, by Ferdinand III as a diplomat or spy. 1652 found him in Paris where he likely became acquainted with composer, Louis Couperin, before returning to Vienna yet again in 1653. He there completed 'Libro Quarto' [IMSLP] in 1656. Like 'Libro Secundo', 'Quatro' contained 24 pieces divided into four chapters, this time containing six each of toccatas, suites, ricercars and capriccios. Froberger transitioned to Leopold I upon Ferdinand's death in 1657. He that year dedicated 'Libro di capricci e ricercate' to Leopold. Nevertheless, political complexity at Leopold's court found Froberger released from service the same year. Though known to have made a brief trip to Mainz in 1665 he spent the majority of his last ten years in ChÃ¢teau dâHÃ©ricourt in the employ of the dowager Duchess of MontbÃ©liard. He died of apoplexy on 7 May 1667. Unlike many composers of his era, Froberger published none of his work, and only two of his compositions were printed in his lifetime. His teacher in Rome during the forties, Athanasius Kircher, published Froberger's 'Hexachord Fantasia' [1, 2] in his 'Musurgia Universalis' of 1650 [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]. In 1660 FranÃ§ois Roberday published 'Fugues et Caprices' [1, 2] in Paris in which his 'Fugue 5' was a version Froberger's 'Ricercar 1' of 1658. That altered version was the second and last composition by Froberger to see print during his lifetime. The works for which Forberger is best-known and most influential to the Baroque period are his numerous dance suites for keyboards [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] in which he originated the standard order of an allemande first, courante second, sarabande third and gigue fourth. Those seem to be intended more for harpsichord than organ. Froberger's final compositions are thought to have been found in a lost autograph titled 'Livre Primiere' [Asperen] finally emerging at a Sotheby's auction in London in 2006. Froberger's suites are titled Suites in the DTO cataloguing system of Guido Adler [1, 2]. In Siegbert Rampe's [1, 2, 3] more recent system (FbWV) they are called Partitas [*]. Classical Archives presents both [*]. Froberger also composed choral works, two of his motets yet extant: 'Alleluia! Absorpta es mors' and 'Apparuerunt apostolis'. References: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6.

Rosenmuller attended the Lateinschule at Oelsnitz as a youth where music was likely part of his curriculum. He enrolled into the University of Leipzig in 1640 to study theology and might have been composing by that time, as he also studied music under Tobias Michael and acquired employment upon graduating in 1642 as an assistant music teacher at the Thomasschule where he remained throughout the forties. Rosenmuller published his first volume of compositions in 1645: 'Paduanen, Alemanden, Couranten, Balletten, Sarabanden' [1, 2, 3]. 'Kern-Spruche' ('Key-Sayings' from the Old and New Testaments) followed in 1648, a collection of 20 sacred concertos [1, 2, 3, 4]. Rosenmuller was yet a teaching assistant in 1650, but moved up in the world upon becoming an organist at St. Nicholas Church in 1651. He published 'Andere Kern-SprÃ¼che' ('Other Key-Sayings') in Hamburg in 1652 [1, 2, 3], a collection of sacred songs for voice, strings (violin, viol) and continuo (unspecified bass instrument). Becoming musical director in absentia to the Altenburg court some 25 miles south of Leipzig in 1654, he published 'Studenten-Music' [1, 2, 3], a collection of seven dances (Paduans) and 10 suites for unspecified instruments. \"Paduan\" probably refers to the pavane [1, 2], a slow processional court dance originating in Italy in the early 16th century similar to the basse dance [*] emerging in France in the 14th century. Rosenmuller was imprisoned the next year for homosexual activity. Yet 1658 found him enviably employed at St. Mark's Basilica in Venice, he having escaped. Between 1678 and 1682 he taught music at the Ospedale della PietÃ , an esteemed music school and orphanage. His final volume of compositions, 'Sonate Ã 2, 3, 4 Ã¨ 5 Stromenti', arrived in 1682 [1, 2]. He next served the court of Anthony Ulrich, Duke of Brunswick-WolfenbÃ¼ttel, as choirmaster until his death in WolfenbÃ¼ttel on 10 September 1684. Rosenmuller brings us to a couple important elements in baroque, late here in addressing, which bear mention before continuing much further. The first is continuo, also known as basso continuo or figured bass [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]. Continuo dates back to the latter 16th century upon the emergence of polychoral works as an instrumental means of keeping a constant meter or recurring rhythm. That flowed into the Baroque to become a standard method of the period elemental to baroque notation as well. Relatedly, it is during the baroque that bar lines were added to the staff specifically to indicate regular repeating measures. Bar lines in earlier scores of the 15th or 16th century had other divisional purposes, sometimes to define each beat. The basso continuo had been preceded by the ostinato in the interest of persistently repeating musical patterns or phrases. Ostinatos are identified as early as the 13th century in the English rota or round, 'Sumer is icumen in' ('Summer Has Arrived') of 1260 in particular, that possibly written by W. de Wycombe. Rendition by the Hilliard Ensemble. The ostinato made its way into the Baroque to remain ever since, arriving to contemporary times as the riff or vamp. A good example of a modern ostinato ia the driving bass and piano in Henry Mancini's 'Peter Gunn'. References: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6. Scores: 1, 2, 3, 4. Compositions.

The first record of the Couperin name is from 1356. The first musical Couperin is thought be one Mathurin Couperin, an amateur who was a trader by profession. His son, Charles, was the father of Louis. Though Louis played viol as well, the majority of his compositions were for harpsichord and organ. Among first records of him he is discovered to be a cleric in Chaumes by 1641. He was probably composing by some time in the forties and skilled at harpsichord, as his career in music is said to have sparked in 1650 when he and two younger brothers performed compositions by Louis for composer and harpsichordist, Jacques Champion de ChambonniÃ¨res [*], at the latter's home in Le Plessis-Feu-Aussoux near Paris ['Le Parnasse FranÃ§ois' Titon du Tillet Evrard]. ChambonniÃ¨res was impressed, upon which Couperin traded Chaumes-en-Brie for Paris 30 miles of so northeast to began studies under ChambonniÃ¨res. In 1653 Couperin became an organist at the Church of St. Gervais in Paris where he remained the whole of his career. During that time he also worked for Marquis Abel Servien from 1656 to 1658. Couperin died on 29 August 1661, only about age thirty-five, causes unknown. Louis' younger brothers, Charles and FranÃ§ois, with whom he'd begun his career only a decade earlier were also living at St. Gervais. Though literature about Couperin is less than vast, he enjoyed the high esteem of his peers at the time as an especially talented craftsman, both as a composer and performer. A couple hundred compositions by Couperin exist in the Bauyn manuscript of 1690 [1, 2] and the Oldham manuscript discovered in 1957 [1, 2]. Louis himself didn't publish anything during his lifetime. Images of the Couperin family are not uncommonly confused. Research on any of them invariably finds one represented as another somewhere. The image to the right is a portrait Louis' brother, Charles, painted by Claude LefÃ¨bvre sometime between 1665 and 1670. That is the Charles who began his career along with Louis and Francois mentioned above. The portrait is often mistaken for Louis, made easy by the 1979 album issued by Gustav Leonhardt, 'Suiten und Pavane', which has Charles' portrait on its cover as Louis. No images of Louis, if any exist, are found. See 'The Other M Couperin' by Glen Wilson as to Louis' brother, Charles (1639-79). As for Francois (1631-1701), though reportedly popular and talented at harpsichord alike Louis, he remains an obscure figure, not to be confused with Louis' later nephew, FranÃ§ois Couperin le Grand (1668-1733), son of Charles to the right.

As is father taught him music as a youth Giovanni may have been composing by the time of his earliest known employment as organist at the Basilica di Santa Maria Maggiore in Bergamo in 1645 where he remained until 1656. He was ordained as a priest in 1651. He first published in 1654 in Venice, a book of music for Mass and Vespers called 'Concerti Musicali Op 1' [1, 2, 3]. In 1656 Legrenzi became maestro di cappella at the Academy of the Holy Spirit until 1665, that a fraternity of musicians who supplied music in Ferrara. His first of nineteen operas, 'Nino, il giusto', was performed in 1662 in Ferrara. His second opera, 'L'achille in Sciro' [*], premiered in 1663 in Ferrara. Partnering w librettist, Ippolito Bentivoglio [*], that was greatly successful, his now becoming a name. Along w operas Legrenzi wrote numerous oratorios. Oratorios are grand choral and instrumental works like opera but without stage, made to hear rather than see. His first, 'Oratorio del giuditio', premiered in Vienna in 1665. In 1670 he was appointed Maestro di Musica at the Ospedale Santa Maria dei Derelitti in Venice, more commonly called the Ospedaletto. By that time Legrenzi owned land in Clusone, comfortable of numerous published works and several operas. While at the Ospedaletto, Legrenzi composed 'La divisione del mondo' [1, 2] for premiere at the Teatro San Salvador in Venice on 4 Feb 1675, that among his most popular works. He became Maestro di Coro of the Ospedale dei Mendicanti in 1676 until 1682. Legrenzi was a star composer by then, but the early eighties brought increased upon the premiere of 'Il Giustino' at the Teatro San Salvador in Venice on 7 Feb 1683. He followed that the next year w his highly successful 'Publio Elio Pertinace' [1, 2]. Legranzi was appointed Maestro di Cappella at San Marco (St. Mark's Basilica) in April 1685, followed by his final opera, 'Ifianassa e Melampo', that autumn. His last of fourteen oratorios [Wikipedia], 'Erodiade', appeared in 1687. Legrenzi's health had begun to falter by the time he became Maestro at San Marco, less and less able to perform. He is thought to have died in the horrible pain of kidney stones on 27 May 1690. His last two books assigned an opus were 'Sonate a 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 e 7 istrumenti' (Op 18) in 1693 and 'Voci geniali, raccolte in duetti e terzetti' (Op 19) in 1698. Both of these are lost. Works with opus (plural = opera) numbers (: Op 1) in Legrenzi are other than his operas or oratorios and were later assigned due to necessity upon a couple of volumes mistakenly introduced as his tenth. His first opus, 'Concerti Musicali', had been described as \"Opera Prima\" on the title page, not Opus 1. In 1670 his 'Acclamationi Divote' [1, 2] was described as 'Opera X'. Three years later his 'La Cetra' [*] was erroneously printed as 'Opera Decima'. As both couldn't be his tenth, a revised copy of 'Acclamationi Divote' remedied the problem by describing it as 'Opera Xi', the small \"i\" indicating a plural. Legrenzi's volume following 'La Cetra' ('Cantate e Canzonette': 1, 2) was correctly labeled his twelfth in 1676, although 'La Cetra' was reissued in 1682 once again erroneously as his tenth. \"What a lot of baloney!\" he might have shouted to the skies, both editions printed in Bologna. Eventually 'Acclamationi Divote' became as it was, Op 10, 'La Cetra' became Op 11 and 'Cantate e Canzonette' Op 12. References: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7. Publications. Scores: 1, 2.

Originally named Giovanni Battista Lulli, he learned guitar and violin as a youth, taught by a Franciscan friar. In 1646 Charles, Duke of Guise, saw Lully play violin at Mardi Gras and took him to Paris to serve his niece, Mademoiselle de Montpensier (Duchess of Montpensier), as chamber boy, also working in the scullery. He meanwhile assisted her with conversational Italian. As a skilled musician, however, he was soon studying keyboard under Nicolas Gigault and Francois Roberday. Examining theory with Nicolas MÃ©tru, he also performed with the court's musicians. He is later quoted as saying that he learned everything he needed to know about music by age seventeen while in the service of M de Montpensier. He left that position in 1652, not wishing to follow his matron into rural exile, her life in danger duef the Fronde rebellions of 1648-59. Which is one version. The other is that he was dismissed for writing \"scurrilous\" verse. Either way, in 1653 Lully met fifteen year-old Louis XIV, the pair dancing together in a ballet, upon which he became court composer of instrumental music. When Louis began governing in 1661 Lully officially became a French subject and musical director for the royal family, at which point his compositions were automatically published. In 15 years he'd climbed from humble positions in a royal household, albeit that of a duchess up there with the face cards, to a plateau where there was no higher a musician could go. Except to also begin an eleven-year collaboration with the playwright, MoliÃ¨re, in 1661, they producing 'Les FÃ¢cheux' that year, and 'Le Mariage ForcÃ©' in 1664. In 1672 he became director of the AcadÃ©mie Royale de Musique, that is, royal opera, thereafter producing nigh an opera per year until his passing in 1687. During that time in the early eighties he began to fall from Louis' favor, perhaps for being bisexual. In 1687 Lully managed to accidentally puncture his foot with a conducting wand during a performance celebrating Louis' recovery from recent surgery, to die of gangrene in Paris on 22 March 1687. The largest body of Lully's works were intermedes (music inserted between acts or written into another composer's work such as a ballet), ballets du cour (court ballets), sacred motets grand and petit, and operas. Among ballets were his French overtures as well as the comÃ©die-ballet with MoliÃ¨re. One thing you would probably see in a scene in a movie about Louis XIV is the minuet, brought to Earth by Lully, though some think it originated in the province of Poitou, he picking it up for theatrical works which tempo is quicker than for the slower disciplined dance that become popular during Lully's service to Louis. Lully composed some 92 theatrical minuets. Johann Sebastian Bach and George Handel later included minuets in suites, and Mozart's first composition at age 6 was a minuet. It developed into the scherzo w Beethoven. By the time Lully was finished so was Italian dominance of the baroque, that moving to northern Europe. Albeit Italiano, Lully made a point of being a French composer by once stating, \"Italy? Never heard of it.\" References for Lully: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5. Compositions. Scores: 1, 2, 3, 4.

Along w a lot of keyboard music, Pasquini composed largely cantatas, operas and oratorios, forms arising simultaneously and elemental to the Baroque period. Pasquini had studied under Mariotto Bocciantini in Uzzano before following his uncle to Ferrara in 1650 where he became a university organist at Accademia della Morte in 1654. 1657 found him an organist at Santa Maria in Vallicella. In 1664 he began doing double duty as organist at both the Basilica di Santa Maria Maggiore and Santa Maria in Aracoeli. He found patronage in Prince Borghese in 1667. In 1706 Pasquini became a member of the Accademia degli Arcadi, an influential literary and musical circle formed in 1656 by Queen Christina (who had abdicated the Swedish throne in 1654, converted to Catholicism and moved to Rome). Pasquini was buried in the Church of St Lawrence in Lucina upon his death in Rome on 21 Nov 1710. References: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6. Compositions. Scores: 1, 2.

Others think he was born in Holstein when it was part of Denmark instead of Germany. Either way he was Dane with a name Germanized by himself (Diderich to Dietrich). As Buxtehude's father was a church organist in HelsingÃ¸r he likely studied music as a youth. Buxtehude is thought to have been employed as an organist in 1657 in Helsingborg, then at HelsingÃ¸r in 1660. In 1668 he succeeded Franz Tunder as organist at St. Mary's Church in LÃ¼beck. Buxtehude composed largely for organ, harpsichord and voice in a broad variety of forms, though he preferred cantatas, preludes, sonatas and fugues. The librettos to his oratorios survive, but the scores do not. Buxtehude's position at St. Mary's might have been enviable, but only to degree. Wishing to retire in 1703, he offered his station to both Johann Mattheson and George Handel (the pair traveling to visit him together) on condition that it come with betrothal to one of his daughters, Anna Margareta. Both declined, leaving the next day [1, 2, 3]. It wasn't easy for Buxtehude's daughter, unblessed w comely appearance, to be as popular as her father's music: in 1705 Johann Sebastian Bach was twenty years old when he walked more than 250 miles to study under Buxtehude. Though he stayed three months he left a bachelor as well. Buxtehude died two years later on 9 May 1707. His position along w Anna Margareta went to Johann Christian Schieferdecker.

He's not to be confused with Sebastian's uncle or brother, both composers, all three sharing the same name [*]. This Cristoph Bach was elder brother to composer, Johann Michael Bach, with whom German Baroque came into full bloom. Like the musical dynasty of which Louis Couperin was a member [*], there were enough musicians popping out of Bach ovens to run a Nabisco plant [Bach dynasty: 1, 2, 3], of which this history treats only eight. The Couperin name was perhaps a couple centuries older than Bach's. It's thought that at the start of the 16th century there existed four branches of the Bach family, though the first records of a Bach don't occur until Veit (Vitus) Bach about 1550, a baker in Wechmar who had fled Hungary for being Lutheran. The first known musically professional Bach was Johannes Hans, born about 1580, who preferred playing pipe to baking. But with Johann Cristoph and his brother, Johann Michael, the Bach name began to loom large. As the son of Heinrich Bach, the latter a musician, Johann Christoph was taught music as a youth, most likely composing by the sixties. Bach Cantatas has him employed at the Arnstadt castle chapel in Thuringia as of 20 Nov 1663. Two years later he became town organist of Eisenach at St. George's where he remained his whole career. Also employed as organist and harpsichordist at the kapelle (chapel) of the court of the Duke of Eisenach, he likewise held that position until his death. Albeit Johann Christoph Bach was a successful composer and organist, ranked by some as the only other Bach to approach the stature of Johann Sebastian, he didn't have a head for finance, dying heavily in debt in Eisenach on 31 March 1703.

'Webster's' has the term \"serenade\" originating in 1649 from Latin \"serenus\" (serene). Most are familiar w the serenade as a romantic piece performed in open air in the evening for a lover at a window as compared to the aubade [c 1678 'Webster's'] performed in the morning. Stradella's serenatas were composed for performance outdoors in the evening as well, excepting for more elaborate orchestration. Stradella is also credited with the first concerto grosso circa 1675, his one and only to fit the bill before the term was first used by Aracngelo Corelli about 1681 as distinct from his smaller concertinos [*]. Stredella's father may have been a cavalier (knight) and governor of Vignola when Alessandro was born. Sources vary widely on just when he arrived in Rome from 1653 to 1654, but he is apparently on record as a singer at St. Marcello del Crocifisso Cathedral in 1655 ['Choral Repertoire' Dennis Shrock]. Probably beginning to study music soon, come 1658 he was a singer in the employment of Queen Christina of Sweden [All Music Blair Johnston], she having given up her throne at age 28 to live in Rome from 1654 to her death in 1689. Johnston and Shrock have Stradella writing his first composition for Christina in 1663, a motet called 'Chare Jesu Suavissime'. Come 1669 he was composing for the new theatre in Rome, the Teatro Torinona [Greene]. Among other of Stradella's skills, however, was getting into trouble. The first such occasion arrived in 1669 when a failed attempt to embezzle money from the Church had him leaving Rome briefly, returned by 1670. A public dispute with a cardinal in 1677 required leaving for the safety of Venice, he not to see Rome again. Stradella was soon hired in Venice by Doge Alvise Contarini [*] of the Contarini dynasty to tutor his mistress, Agnese Van Uffele. But Alessandro and Agnese ran off to Turin together instead. Contarini followed where he found assistance in the Church, Uffele forced to choose between becoming a nun or wedding Stradella, which the pair did on 10 October 1677 [*]. \"You think?\" Contarini soon thought, then had Stradella assassinated, or so he believed. Stradella survived and was in Genoa come early 1678. Uffele disappeared after those few moments for the annals of history. In Genoa Stradella composed for the Teatro Falcone [1, 2] and local nobility. Stradella's comic opera (opera buffa), 'Il Trespolo tutore' [1, 2, 3], premiered at Il Falcone in January of 1679. Come his opera, 'Doriclea', in 1681. He is thought to have composed 'Moro per amore' the same year, though it wasn't presented to the public until 1695, thirteen years after his death. Stradella was stabbed to death on 25 Feb 1682 at the Piazza Banchi. Once again concerning an affair, this time the cuckold was a member of the Lomellini family, his hitmen more successful than had been Contarini's. Between poking where he oughtn't have and otherwise living dangerously Stradella managed more than 300 works, including a minimum of six operas, 170 cantatas and 27 instrumental pieces. Leaving his manuscripts to an underage son, those were sold with the assistance of a friar to Francesco II d'Este, Duke of Modena, for 600 gold doubloons, now collected at the Estensian Library in Modena [*]. The image to the right is easily mistaken for Stradella as it is nigh universally done. Though the painter remains anonymous, that it is Francesco II, not Stradella, is confirmed by similar depictions, including a nigh identical engraving by Isabella Piccini published in 1690 [*]. Stradella was later the subject of Friedrich Wilhelm Riese's opera, 'Alessandro Stradella', premiering at the Stadttheater in Hamburg on 30 December 1844.

Of the Bach musical dynasty [1, 2, 3] he is the second of only eight addressed in this history. The brothers never worked together, but historically they announced the beginning of the end of Italian dominance in the baroque, that to shift to Germany while France gave it Continental flavors. Like Johann Cristoph, more is known about his music than his life. As his father, Heinrich Bach , was an organist he likely studied music including composition as a youth. Aryeh Oron at Bach Cantatas has him replacing his brother, Johann Christoph, at organ at the Arnstadt castle chapel in Thuringia in 1665. In 1673 Johann Michael was employed as an organist and town clerk in Gehren where he remained until his death. He is thought to have been a craftsman of musical instruments such as the harpsichord, dying on 27 May 1694. References: 1, 2, 3. Das Alt-Baschische Archiv: 1, 2. Scores: 1, 2. Audio: 1, 2.

Blow was of major significance to the music of England as teacher to Henry Purcell at the Chapel Royal as of 1674. Blow himself had studied music as a boy as a chorister at the Chapel Royal as early as 1660, perhaps serving in that capacity earlier someplace else, as that placed him in the high employ of King Charles II. Among titles composed by him as a youth was 'Club Anthem' of 1664 when he was fifteen, written w Pelham Humfrey and William Turner [*]. In 1668 he succeeded Albertus Bryan as organist at Westminster Abbey [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]. He was made gentleman at the Chapel Royal in 1673 and by 1678 he had earned a doctorate. The degree of doctor (\"teacher\") had been around for centuries, ever since the Catholic Church needed academicians to translate Latin. Blow was succeeded at Westminster in 1679 by Purcell. Either dismissed or resigning, he began to concentrate on writing songs about that time. He is thought to have composed his masque, 'Venis and Adonis' in 1683. The masque was something the predecessor to opera, developed in Italy in the 16th century out of a folk tradition in which masked dancers brought gifts to nobles on notable occasions. It eventually split into two types, the intermedio, a great theatrical production exclusive to the court, and the pageant, the public version. In 1685 Blow was appointed a private musician to James II. 1687 found him choirmaster at St. Paul's Cathedral. Blow was back at Westminster in 1695 upon the death of Purcell. He became Composer to the Chapel Royal in 1699, a newly created title. Blow composed fourteen Anglican services, but the anthem was the rabbit in his hat, writing more than a hundred of them. He died on 1 October 1708 and was buried in Westminster Abbey. References: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5. Compositions. Scores: 1, 2; 'Six Songs'. Audio: 1, 2, 3. Discos: 1, 2, 3, 4.

Both Johann Sebastian Bach and George Frideric Handel later studied his work, his concerti grossi in particular. In the meantime Corelli's love of violin kept Italy in the business of baroque. Leaving behind about sixty sonatas, though his chamber works are surely notable, they are his twelve concerti grossi which made the concerto grosso to the latter baroque what the symphony would be to the classical period. Corelli came from a family that had been purchasing land since the early 16th century so, though not of nobility, the clan was prosperous. Corelli is thought to have studied in Faenza and Luga before turning up in Bologna in 1666 at age thirteen to pursue the violin. He became a student at the Accademia Filarmonica di Bologna in 1670 at age seventeen [*]. He may have traveled in Germany before arriving in Rome in 1675 and visited again on later dates, though such is more suspected than certain. Corelli enjoyed a stellar career composing and performing for some of Italy's highest-ranking personalities, such Queen Christina of Sweden, foremost patroness of the arts in Rome upon her exile from Sweden at age 28 (1655). Corelli dedicated his 1681 'Op 1' of twelve trio sonatas to Christina. He dedicated his 1685 'Op 2' of twelve trio sonatas to Cardinal Pamphili for whom he had first performed in 1676 and would become employed again in 1687. His 'Op 3' of 12 more sonatas in 1689 was dedicated to Francesco II d'Este, Duke of Modena whom he was visiting at the time. Francesco II had purchased the collected manuscripts of Alessandro Stradella upon the latter's untimely death in 1682, acquired from Stradella's underage son. Corelli's 'Op 4' of twelve trio sonatas in 1694 was dedicated to Cardinal Ottoboni with whom he'd become employed in 1690 upon the Pamphili's relocation to Bologna. The twelve sonatas which make up Corelli's 'Op 5' [*] of 1 January 1700 went to Sophia Charlotte, Electress of Brandenburg. Corelli's last published work, 'Op 6' [*], consisted of twelve concerti grossi composed in the early 1680s but printed only posthumously in 1714. Corelli had died in Rome on 8 January 1713 with considerable wealth, worth about 120,000 marks with collections of art and fine violins. References: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7. Compositions: 1, 2.

Pachelbel received training in his youth from composer, Heinrich Schwemmer. He matriculated into the University of Altdorf in 1669, the same year he took a position as organist at St. Lorenz Church. 1670 found Pachelbel at the Gymnasium Poeticum at Regensburg with a scholarship. In 1673 he was in Vienna working as a deputy organist at Saint Stephen's Cathedral. Nice as Habsburg Vienna was at the time, he left for Eisenach in Habsburg Germany in 1677, there appointed court organist to Duke Johann Georg I, also making acquaintance of some of the Bach family). In 1678 he was employed at the Predigerkirche in Erfurt where his association with the Bach family continued. During his twelve years in Erfurt where he made his name he taught Johann Christoph Bach (1671â1721, elder brother to Johann Sebastian; not Johann Christoph Bach 1642-1703). Pachelbel further had Johann Christian Bach (1640-1682) for a landlord (not Johann Christian Bach (1735-1782). Pachelbel may have composed his most famous work, 'Canon and Gigue for 3 violins and basso continuo', at Erfurt circa 1680 [1, 2, 3; see also canon]. In 1690 Pachelbel found patronage in Duchess Magdalena Sibylla as musician and organist to the court of WÃ¼rttemberg in Stuttgart. Unfortunately, he had to flee that position two years later. Stuttgart had already been subjected to the horrendous Thirty Years War [1, 2, 3, 4] between France and the Habsburgs which Johann Froberger had survived [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]. That misery ending in 1648, now it was the Nine Years War between France and the Grand Alliance begun in 1688 [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]. Removing himself to Gotha, Pachelbel became town organist there for a couple years, publishing the liturgical collection, 'Acht Chorale zum Praeambulieren', in 1693. In 1695 he was invited to become organist at St. Sebaldus Church in Nuremberg. He there published 'Musicalische ErgÃ¶tzung', a collection of chamber music, as early as 1699. He also published 'Hexachordum Apollinis' in 1699, a set of six keyboard arias. Quite active during his latter years, Pachelbel also completed above ninety Magnificat fugues before his death in 1706, buried on 9 March in Nuremberg. Of Pachelbel's surviving works nigh half are chorales [1, 2]. Simply put, a chorale is the melody of a hymn. Chorales had been being composed since the early 16th century, their impetus being the removal of the Latin language from church music. One very famous instance of an early chorale is Martin Luther's, 'A Mighty Fortress', written about 1528, to which he also supplied the lyrics. A prolific composer, Pachelbel also wrote toccatas, fantasias and suites amidst more than 530 compositions. Though well esteemed during his lifetime, Pachelbel largely fell into neglect thereafter, his great fame during these times occurring of renewed interest in the 20th century.

His youth obscure, consensus has Torelli leaving Verona for Bologna in the early eighties, perhaps appointed maestro di cappella (master of the chapel) at the Imola Cathedral as early as 1681. Torelli studied composition with Giacomo Antonio Perti before joining the Accademia Filarmonica di Bologna [musical association: 1, 2] in 1684. He became Concert Master at the court of George Frederick II, Margrave of Brandenburg-Ansbach, in 1698.

Due largely to the Reformation and situations peculiar to being an island something segregated from continental Europe, music in England rather kept its own pace. While early baroque instrumentation was being developed and pursued in Italy the Brits preferred song like airs and, especially, the madrigal. Albeit Brits kept pace with the rest of Europe in matters of love and hate, and sex and war â which write the history of humankind along w religion (convenient conventional face of the spiritual), economics and technology â they yet far exceeded the rest of Europe in literacy of the common Joe. The printing press that had been invented by Guttenberg in Germany about 1440 didn't translate into concern that the common people know how to read and write until Elizabeth I (1558-1603) by whose end of reign nearly everyone in England was literate. England also exceeded the status quo on the continent with Purcell, a prolific composer of anthems, hymns, catches, odes, songs, suites, movements (sections), fantasies (free form) and sonatas in addition to not a little else. Purcell's father (Henry Sr.) was a musician, indeed, a gentleman of the Chapel Royal of King Charles II (1630-85). His father dying in 1664, Purcell was entered into the care of an uncle, also a gentleman, who had Purcell admitted as a chorister. He thereat began to study music and is thought to have begun composing at about age nine. In 1673 Purcell became assistant to an organ builder. He had studied under multiple music teachers, one of them John Blow, but now he was attending Westminster School, such that he became a copyist at Westminster Abbey in 1676. In 1679 he replaced Blow as organist at Westminster Abbey, five of his songs appearing the same year in John Playford's 'Choice Ayres and Songs to Sing to the Theorbo-lute or Bass-viol' [*]. The next year ('80) he published 'Fantasias and In Nomines' [in nomines: 1, 2, 3, 4]. 1682 found him appointed to the Chapel Royal as organist, and it was in that capacity that most his works were created until his death. Purcell published twelve 'Sonatas of III Parts' in 1683, dedicated to Charles II [*]. His first ode to St. Cecilia was performed in London that year on 22 Nov 1683 and published in '84, 'Welcome to All the Pleasures' [1, 2]. A decade later he composed his sacred work, 'Te Deum and Jubilate in D', in 1694 [scores: 1, 2]. He died the next year on 21 November 1695 and was buried in Westminster Abbey. Purcell's widow, Frances, published numerous of his works posthumously including 'A Collection of Ayres' [1, 2] and 'Ten Sonatas in Four Parts' [*] in 1697 and Books I and II of 'Orpheus Britannicus' in 1698 and 1702 [*; scores: 1, 2; text: songs, complete].
