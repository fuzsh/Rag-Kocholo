A veritable explosion of interest in French Baroque music has taken place since B. T. Batsford in London and W. W. Norton in New York published the first and second (revised) editions in 1974 and 1978. The first French edition (La musique en France à l'époque baroque) published by Flammarion in Paris in 1981 included some new material and some new entries in the bibliography, and many corrections to the references. In 1992 Flammarion published a \"nouvelle édition\" that contains a short new essay (a \"postface\") after the main text, a greatly enhanced bibliography, and an index. None but the last French edition remains in print. The complete revision undertaken in this third English edition attempts to incorporate all new significant research of the last two decades in a systematic way. This is particularly reflected in the bibliography. The majority of its 798 new titles date from the decade 19811991, that is, since the publication of the French edition. In spite of its 1304 entries, the bibliography makes no claim for completeness. When one realizes that by 1975 a single scholar, Norbert Dufourcq, had written more than 100 articles dealing with French music of the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, it becomes clear that even an extended bibliography of this general survey must be highly selective. Inevitably, one chooses those titles that have best served one's research, those articles or books that synthesize, that shed light upon the thorny problems of archival studies, deal with social and economic considerations, extend biographical knowledge, advance stylistic insights, and, yes, merely entertain. A selective number of doctoral theses are included. I have opted, however, to exclude a thesis if its author has carried over the essence from his study into a book or an extended article and left behind the chaff of academia. The interested reader will find scattered throughout the bibliography what Laurence Dreyfus referred to as the \"raucous polemics about over-dotting, vibrato, and the performance of trills\" (and, one might add, the performance of the appoggiatura). Although the first volley in the battle of the double dot was fired by Frederick Neumann, writing in French (1965b), all subsequent articles have appeared in English. On a more elevated note, the rich, archival studies of early twentieth-century scholars such as Michel Brenet, Lionel de La Laurencie, and Romain Rolland have been continued by Marcelle Benoit and, most recently, by Jérôme de La Gorce and Catherine Massip, among others. The chronological boundaries of the book are, of course, respected in the bibliography. They remain generally fixed from about 1581 (Ballet comique de la reine) to about 1733 (death of François Couperin and first performance of Rameau's Hippolyte et Aricie). Whereas it is not possible to posit a specific date to mark stylistic change, any general survey of a stylistic period must have a beginning point and cannot be totally open-ended. The Ballet comique is the first court ballet to adumbrate French Baroque opera. It is not uncommon to find the time span of a book to be framed by its most important people (\"from Monteverdi to Bach,\" for example). François Couperin, if not the most representative composer of the grand siècle, was arguably the greatest composer of the declining years of the Roi Soleil and of the Regency. The choice of the first performance date of Rameau's opera as a terminal point begs explanation. Although elements of Hippolyte refer back to Lullian models and more particularly to préramiste* experiments, changes in Hippolyte were perceived as a break with tradition, a sea change in the music of the French Baroque. For the Almanach des spectacles of 1765, Hippolyte marked the date of a \"revolution\" in French music. One year earlier in the Éloge de M. Rameau, MichelPaul Guy de Chabanon had written, \"This revolution was sudden; the opera Hippolyte began it; Les Indes galantes continued it\" (1764). The ensuing battles between the Lullistes and the\n\nCreated with Print2PDF.

For this reason, Rameau sources are generally restricted in this bibliography to his keyboard music, motets, and cantatasnearly all composed before Hippolyte et Aricie. \"La musique baroque française, existe-t-elle?\" This pointed question, found in a review of La musique en France à l'époque baroque in a Swiss journal (Construire, 8 December 1982), was posed in many French language reviews of this book. It highlights the fact that there is no consensus regarding the coupling of the terms French and Baroque. To the end of his life, Norbert Dufourcq (d. 1990) remained the most forceful (and eloquent) opponent of the concept of ''French Baroque music.\" In a review of Jean-Baptiste Lully and the Music of the French Baroque, in the pages of the important journal that he founded, he wrote: Concerning this subject, we will not reopen this quarrel, vain as it is useless, over acceptance of the word baroque. Let the foreigner give our music the appellation he has chosen, while the French school generally means by classique the entire period that extends from 1661 to Berlioz\" (19881990 Recherches sur la musique française classique 26:236, note 5).\n\nIt is ironic that at Versailles itself, the sanctum sanctorum of the Roi Soleil, a Centre de Musique Baroque de Versailles (CMBV) was established in 1987. An important component of the Centre is the \"Atelier d'études sur la musique française des XVIIe & XVIIIe siècles\" directed by Jean Duron, which has impressive tools for database and library research. The CMBV has enlarged the parameters of French \"Baroque\" music from 15811733 to 15891789, which increases overlap with Dufourcq's French \"Classical\" music (1661 to Berlioz). To be sure, the use of the term Baroque is an over-simplification. Few will deny that French music of the seventeenth and early eighteenth centuries reflects the classical (with a small \"c\") bias of the grand siècle in the plastic and visual arts, architecture, drama, literature, and the history of ideas. Yet there is an extended meaning of Baroque (with a capital B) that embraces purely musical practices, such as the basse continue or the stile concertato, and relates the French Baroque musical experience to that of Germany, Italy, and England. The contrast between the V parties (ed. J. Quitin) have been published by the Société Liégeoise de Musicologie, and the Corpus des luthistes français (CNRS) continues its monumental task of publishing the complete French lute repertory. With very few exceptions, on the other hand, high-caliber performance editions of the music of Jean-Baptiste Lully and Jean-Philippe Rameau, the two giants of the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, respectively, have malingered in limbo. In spite of the Jean-Baptiste Lully. Actes du colloque (1990), Jean-Baptiste Lully and the Music of the French Baroque (1989), and JeanPhilippe Rameau. Actes du colloque (1986), when it comes to the music, itself, we have hardly progressed beyond the incomplete Lully Oeuvres complètes edited by Prunières in the 1930s and the flawed Rameau Oeuvres complètes edited by Saint-Saëns in the early years of this century. There is hope in the fact that committees recently formed in France have undertaken the responsibility of preparing new editions of the complete works of Lully (committee headed by Jérôme de La Gorce and Herbert Schneider) and Rameau (committee headed by Silvie Boissou). In the late 1960s, Gregg Press published facsimile editions of certain French Baroque operas that now, sadly, are out of print (for example, Charpentier's Médée, Campra's L'Europe galante, and Destouches's Amadis de Grèce). The 1970s saw ambitious projects such as facsimiles of the\n\nCreated with Print2PDF.

Chief among the facsimile editions of the 1980s and 1990s are The Eighteenth-Century French Cantata (Garland) in seventeen volumes with commentary by David Tunley, French Opera in the Seventeenth and Eighteenth Centuries edited by Barry S. Brook in seventy-five volumes (eleven of which have already been published by Pendragon Press), and the Mélanges autographs by Charpentier in thirty volumes, mentioned above (Minkoff). Of great importance for any study of primary sources are the more than 700 facsimile editions of treatises and music scores (see, for example, the twenty-nine volumes of clavecinistes français du XVIIIe siècle) published by Minkoff. Knowledge for its own sake is valuable and its accumulation can be justified, but ideally the research involved in books and articles and in musical editions should lead to performance. French Baroque music demands much from the professional and amateur performer. Without becoming distracted by the \"raucous polemics\" of performance authenticity regarding the use of period versus modern instruments, the performer must have some understanding of rhythmic alterations, of the appropriate and refined application of ornaments that is one step removed from improvisation, of correct declamation, and, above all, an appreciation of the central importance of dance gesture to all of this music. Accurate reading of the notes on the page is petit choeur in trio texture and the five-part tous found in the introductory symphonie of Lully's Te Deum owes as much to the stile concertato of the Italian Baroque as Armide's recitative, \"Enfin, il est en ma puissance,\" owes to the classical declamation of Racine. There appears to be more tolerance today in France, if not for total acceptance of the term Baroque (hardly desirable in any case), at least for the coexistence of Baroque and Classical. The simplest and most accurate way of defining this period is to follow Marcelle Benoit, who changed the name of the dictionary published by Fayard under her direction from Dictionnaire de la musique classique en France, 15891789 to Dictionnaire de la musique en France aux XVIIe et XVIIIe siècles. Tangible evidence of increased interest in French Baroque music extends far beyond a statistical study of the lengthened bibliography. Herbert Schneider's Lully Werke Verzeichnis (LWV) was published in 1981, the year French Baroque Music was translated into French. H. Wiley Hitchcock's Catalogue raisonné of the complete works of MarcAntoine Charpentier appeared the following year. In preparation or already completed are the Catalogues raisonnés of the complete works of Michel-Richard Delalande (Lionel Sawkins), Sébastien de Brossard (Jean Duron), Michel Lambert (Catherine Massip), Henry Du Mont (Jean Lionnet), Daniel Daniélis (Catherine Cessac), Guillaume Bouzignac (Marie Joelle Ebtinger), and Nicolas Bernier (Nathalie Berton). A Catalogue thématique des sources du grand motet français was published under the direction of Jean Mongrédien in 1984. A Catalogue raisonné by Carl Schmidt of the livrets of Lully's tragédies lyriques was published in 1995. Unfortunately, in the face of mounting economic difficulties and in spite of the unstinting efforts of Marcelle Benoit, Recherches sur la musique française classique is in grave danger of ceasing publication. XVIIe siècle devotes an occasional issue to some aspect of the music of this period. More recently, through its database and annual Bulletin, the Atelier d'études sur la musique française des XVIIe & XVIIIe siècles serves as an important clearing house for all information on current research. The past decade has witnessed a steady proliferation of performance and facsimile editions of French Baroque music. Happily, it is no longer possible to state, for example, that the motets and Masses by Marc-Antoine Charpentier \"slumber today undisturbed in the archives of the Bibliothèque Nationale and the Bibliothèque Municipale of Versailles\" (French Baroque Music,\n\nCreated with Print2PDF.

A sampling of recent performance editions of Charpentier's music could include the opera Médée; the opera David et Jonathas; Neuf leçons de ténèbres; Charpentier's music for Molière's comedies; and motets, Masses, and oratorios published by CMBV, Éditions des Abbesses, and Musica Gallica. Complementing musical editions of Charpentier's work is a body of important articles and theses, two studies of life and works (a long monograph by Catherine Cessac, and a highly concentrated biography by H. Wiley Hitchcock), a semiannual Bulletin de la Société MarcAntoine Charpentier (ed. Cessac), the first volumes of the projected thirty-volume Mélanges autographes (Minkoff), and an impressive discography. A selected list of music editions would also note that within the last twelve years, a few grands motets by Henry Desmarest have been edited by Jean Duron, and grands motets by MichelRichard Delalande have been edited by Lionel Sawkins and by Philippe Oboussier. The Dialogus de anima by Henry Du Mont (ed. Jean Lionnet) is the first volume of the complete works of Du Mont to be published by the CMBV. The two volumes of Du Mont's Mélanges à II, III, IV, et V parties (ed. J. Quitin) have been published by the Société Liégeoise de Musicologie, and the Corpus des luthistes français (CNRS) continues its monumental task of publishing the complete French lute repertory. With very few exceptions, on the other hand, high-caliber performance editions of the music of Jean-Baptiste Lully and Jean-Philippe Rameau, the two giants of the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, respectively, have malingered in limbo. In spite of the Jean-Baptiste Lully. Actes du colloque (1990), Jean-Baptiste Lully and the Music of the French Baroque (1989), and Jean-Philippe Rameau. Actes du colloque (1986), when it comes to the music, itself, we have hardly progressed beyond the incomplete Lully Oeuvres complètes edited by Prunières in the 1930s and the flawed Rameau Oeuvres complètes edited by Saint-Saëns in the early years of this century. There is hope in the fact that committees recently formed in France have undertaken the responsibility of preparing new editions of the complete works of Lully (committee headed by Jérôme de La Gorce and Herbert Schneider) and Rameau (committee headed by Silvie Boissou). In the late 1960s, Gregg Press published facsimile editions of certain French Baroque operas that now, sadly, are out of print (for example, Charpentier's Médée, Campra's L'Europe galante, and Destouches's Amadis de Grèce). The 1970s saw ambitious projects such as facsimiles of the Manuscrit Bauyn (Minkoff), the Pièces de clavecin by François Couperin, and the Pièces de clavecin by Rameau (Broude Trust). Chief among the facsimile editions of the 1980s and 1990s are The Eighteenth-Century French Cantata (Garland) in seventeen volumes with commentary by David Tunley, French Opera in the Seventeenth and Eighteenth Centuries edited by Barry S.

Accurate reading of the notes on the page is not enough. \"If one plays Lully as written,\" writes Marc Minkowski, \"without ornaments, without declamatory energy, it can very quickly lead to deadly boredom\" (\"Lully au Théâtre des Champs-Élysées,\" Diapason harmonie, décembre 1991). On the other hand, a performance rooted in clear understanding of the basic principles of French Baroque music can fire the imagination and bring the music of the grand siècle to life for late twentieth-century audiences. A fine example of this is the performance of Lully's Atys by \"Les Arts florissants\" under the direction of William Christie. This tragédie en musique, a favorite of Louis XIV, has been performed more than seventy times since 1986 for enthusiastic audiences in Florence, Paris, Montpellier, Versailles, and Brooklyn. This presents an interesting, though not unprecedented, example of research lagging behind practice, for there is no modern, printed full score of Atys. There exists only a piano-voice reduction dating from the 1880s (Chefs-d'oeuvres classiques de l'opéra français) and a 1987 facsimile of a 1709 short score (Société de Musicologie du Languedoc). Therefore, the full score that was used had to be assembled from the scores and separate parts found in the Bibliothèque Nationale and the Bibliothèque de l'Opéra. In addition to William Christie, Jean-Claude Malgloire (\"La Grande Écurie et la Chambre du Roy\"), Mark Minkowski (\"Musiciens du Louvre\"), Gustav Leonhardt (\"La Petite Bande\"), Philippe Herreweghe (\"Ensemble Vocal et instrumental de la Chapelle Royale\"), and, more recently, Jeffrey Skidmore (''Ex Cathedra\") and Christophe Rousset (\"Les Talens lyriques\"), among others, have made of French Baroque music a vital listening experience. In so doing, they have translated the research listed in my bibliography into sound for stage, chamber, and chapel. I wish to express my deepest gratitude to the following individuals who made the preparation of this final edition of French Baroque Music possible. First and foremost, I acknowledge the careful and painstaking work of my wife Louise in the computer preparation of the manuscript and for her rigorous attention to problems of style and content. Without her, I would not have had the courage to continue. I wish to thank the library staff at the Département de la Musique at the Bibliothèque Nationale for their most generous, conscientious work with Jean-Michel Nectoux in verifying and correcting many references for the French edition of 1981, and for their continued patience and many kindnesses. I owe a great debt to Lionel Sawkins, Jean Duron, Catherine Massip, Marcelle Benoit, Jean Mongrédien, and Catherine Cessac for their encouragement and many insights. I must thank Kathy Krauss of Tucson for her invaluable assistance in the early stages of this revision. I take pleasure in thanking Reinhard Pauly, General Editor, Karen Kirtley, former Editorial Director, and Suzanne Copenhagen, Line Editorall of Amadeus Pressfor their expert guidance and strong support. In conclusion, I wish to thank the Bibliothèque Nationale, the Bibliothèque de l'Opéra, the Special Collections at the University of California at Los Angeles for permission to reproduce illustrations, and the Musée du Louvre for permission to reproduce the painting Le Concert by Nicolas Tournier on the cover. Unless otherwise indicated, all translations are mine. I have included the original French for extracts from poetry. Throughout the book, I have employed the original French spelling, and in my translations I have kept the often bizarre capitalizations of the old French to preserve\n\nCreated with Print2PDF.

Surely no other nation has known the allpervasive, hierarchial organization that characterized the France of Louis XIV. On 9 March 1661, Cardinal Mazarin died; and Louis XIV, at age twenty-three, took unto himself the destiny of France. He chose to become his own first minister, thus eliminating the threat of another power-hungry Cardinal Richelieu or Mazarin. \"Above all,\" he wrote in his Mémoires, \"I was resolved not to have a prime minister . . . there being nothing more shameful than to see, on the one hand, all the power and, on the other, the mere title of king\" (Louis XIV, ed. of 1978, 44). To help him govern and direct policy, he appointed talented and ambitious men from the middle class (among whom were Jean-Baptiste Colbert, Michel Le Tellier, and the Marquis de Louvois), thus inaugurating, in the Duc de Saint-Simon's words, the reign of the vile bourgeoisie. By eliminating the nobility from his councils, he neutralized their power and, in effect, reduced the princes du sang to decorative impotency. In exercising his passion for order at all levels of society, Colbert, between 1661 and his death in 1683, completed the creation of royal academies that were to systematize the artistic and intellectual life of the regime. In 1661 only the Académie Française (established by Cardinal Richelieu in 1635) and the Académie Royale de Peinture et de Sculpture (1648) existed. Within the next decade, Colbert approved the founding of five more academies: Académie Royale de Danse (1661), Académie des Inscriptions et Belles Lettres (1663), Académie des Sciences (1666), Académies d'Opéra (1669, which later became the Académie Royale de Musique [1672]), and the Académie Royale d'Architecture (1671). It is hardly surprising that many facets of musical life of the grand siècle would also fall under a hierarchal administration which reflected the centralized bias of the regime. The phrase, composed or printed \"by express order of His Majesty\" graced many scores ranging from pièces d'occasion, such as the Airs de trompettes, timbales et hautbois fait par Mr. de Luly for the carrousel of Monseigneur (the grand Dauphin) in 1686, to the grands motets composed for the Royal Chapel by Henry Du Mont, Pierre Robert, and Jean-Baptiste Lully. The king, except for some ability on the lute and guitar, made little mark as a performing musician. He was, however, musically literate and possessed a fair amount of critical acumen.\n\nCreated with Print2PDF.

More than any other monarch of his time, he became personally involved in the music for his court, especially in the years following the final move to Versailles in 1682. He chose the music instructors for his family and relatives with care: Michel-Richard Delalande to teach Mlle de Nantes and Mlle de Blois, his daughters by Mme de Montespan; and Marc-Antoine Charpentier to teach composition to his nephew, Philippe II de Bourbon (Duc de Chartres until 1701, then Duc d'Orléans to 1723, Regent of France (17151723). François Couperin, in the preface to his first book of Pièces de clavecin (1713), relates that \"for the last twenty years I have had the honor to be in the King's employ and, during most of this time, to be teaching Monseigneur the Dauphin, the Duc de Bourgogne, and six princes and princesses of the Royal Family.\" Louis XIV suggested to Philippe Quinault and Lully the subject matter of certain tragédies en musiques (Roland, Amadis, Armide); and according to Évrard Titon du Tillet (16771762), 1 gave Louis-Nicolas Clérambault the texts (authors unknown) for several cantatas that were later performed in the apartments of Mme de Maintenon. The king's attitude is well expressed by the archival comment apropos of a vacancy among the musicians of his Chamber: \"When places become available, His Majesty, in line with his plan to appoint individuals experienced in their profession to his Chamber, does not tolerate anyone who lacks these qualities and all the experience necessary to acquit himself of the task perfectly\" (Écorcheville 1906c, 1:26). In order to find individuals \"experienced in their profession,\" he established a series of competitions: the first, to choose four sousmaîtres for his Royal Chapel in 1663 (Du Mont, Gabriel Expilly, Robert, Thomas Gobert), was followed fifteen years later by another competition for the positions of four organists for the Royal Chapel (Guillaume-Gabriel Nivers, Nicolas-Antoine Lebègue, Jacques Thomelin, Jean-Baptiste Buterne); the most impressive of all was the great concours of 1683, again for the Royal Chapel sous-maîtres, in which more than thirty-five applicants from all over the realm competed (see Chapter 13). In choosing Jean-Baptiste Lully as Surintendant et Compositeur de la Musique de la Chambre du Roi in 1661 and in authorizing Lully's \"letters of naturalization\" in December of the same year, Louis XIV was assured of an efficient and ruthless agent whose absolutism, in fact, paralleled his own. The King's Music 2 Music at the court of Louis XIV was organized, from an administrative point of view, into three large divisions: Music of the Chamber (Musique de la Chambre), Music of the Great Stable (Musique de la Grande Écurie), and Music of the Royal Chapel (Musique de la Chapelle Royale). In addition, the Vingt-quatre Violons du Roi (also referred to as the Grande Bande) and the Petits Violons du Roi (referred to as the Petite Bande and later in the century as the Violons du Cabinet), although technically under the administration of the Chamber, were virtually autonomous because of their great prestige. The number of the king's musicians varied at any given time, but, by the end of the reign of Louis XIV, it ranged between 150 and 200 individuals. These were collectively referred to as Musiciens du Roi, or Officiers de la Maison du Roi, or, simply, as Violon de la Chambre du Roi or Hautbois du Roi. To be an officier of the king, one had to fullfill three conditions: to be of good moral character; to profess and practice the Roman Catholic religion; and to possess sufficient funds to buy the post, assuming the other conditions were met. Once installed, the officier soon took active part in choosing his replacement. Succession upon retirement or death was usually accomplished by a survivance in which the officier gave the right to inherit his post to a designated relative, or the right to purchase his post to a friend or, possibly, a student. At Versailles, this was one of the ways to\n\nCreated with Print2PDF.

JeanBaptiste Boesset, for example, was named survancier at age twenty-one by his father, Antoine, in 1635. He then passed the right to the position on to his own son (aged two) in 1667. Those court musicians who could not qualify for officier were divided into three categories: musiciens ordinaires; musiciens extraordinaires (musicians not regularly employed at court but used for certain occasionstown musicians or foreigners, for example); and musiciens suivant la cour, made up of minor artists or, occasionally, students completing their years of apprenticeship. Music of the Chamber The source of the music both of the Chamber and the Stable may be traced back to François I. This most pleasure-loving of the Valois kings, who was receptive both to spectacular fêtes and to the more intimate and contemplative arts, created two categories for his court music. For the music of his Chamber, he chose soloists: singers (for madrigals and chansons), lutenists, and virtuosi cornett players from Italy. Organists, harpsichordists, and viol players joined them later. For his Stable, he chose ensemble instruments appropriate for outdoor performances; they included oboes, sackbuts, and violins for the parades and lavish ceremonies that lent colorful accents to his gentle Loire valley. At some point before 1571 during the reign of Charles IX, the two families of bowed strings (viols and violins) moved from the Stable to the Chamber. In 1592 under Henri IV, the position of Surintendant de la Musique de la Chambre was created. During the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, two men were appointed to hold this position simultaneously. Each served for one of the two terms of the year. In addition to administrative functions, they were responsible for the choice of music and for the overall organization of all non-religious musical performances at court. Aiding the Surintendant was the Maître de Musique de la Chambre, who was also responsible for the musical education as well as the nourishment and even some of the clothing of the pages (boys) assigned to the Chamber. There were three pages in the Chamber and eight assigned to the Royal Chapel (see Sawkins 1987, 316317). The third administrative division was that of Compositeur de la Chambre, whose special task was often reflected in such titles as Compositeur de la musique instrumentale de la Chambre or Compositeur des entrées des ballets. Occasionally, one individual controlled all three divisions. Lully and Delalande, for example, each reigned in isolated splendor during certain periods of their tenure. By 1590, discouraged by poor pay and the interminable wars of religion, many Italian violinists who had been brought to the court of Catherine de Médici by the Maréchal de Brissac and who had acquitted themselves so nobly in the first court ballet, the Ballet comique de la Reine (1581), returned home. French performers now formed the nucleus of players who eventually staffed the most important ensemble groups: the Douze Hautbois and the Vingt-quatre Violons. By 1609 there were twenty-two Violons ordinaires de la Chambre du Roi; by 1626 this group, which then numbered twenty-four, was given official recognition by Louis XIII as the Vingt-quatre Violons du Roi. Some of the best of these violinists came from the Parisian popular orchestras of the Guild (Confrérie) of Saint-Julien. They traded the rough and ready life of the streets for a more genteel existence as a Violon de la Chambre du Roi. Hidden away in the archival records of the Minutier Central are many success stories of Violons de la Chambre such as one Jean de La Motte who entered the king's Chamber as a Violon in 1606 and by 1622 was also dancing teacher of the pages assigned to the Great Stable, and who ended up owning five houses in the Paris suburbs. 3\n\nCreated with Print2PDF. To remove this line, buy a license at: http://www.binarynow.com/\n\nThe Vingt-quatre Violons, often reinforced by the Douze Grands Hautbois of the Great Stable, constitute the first, formally established orchestra to be built around a group of stringed instruments. The distribution of parts within the typical a5 (five-part) texture of French seventeenth-century instrumental music was as follows: six first violins (dessus), six basses (the basse de violon, not the violoncello), and four each of the three inner parts all tuned as the modern viola, but each with its own clef; the inner parts (or the parties de remplissage) were known as haute-contre, taille, and quinte. According to Bernard Bardet, the Petits Violons ensemble served Louis XIV personally and was created for this purpose about 1648 while he was still a boy.4 In March 1653, Lully was appointed Compositeur de la musique instrumentale. At some point after this date, the king assigned the Petits Violons to Lully, who had found fault with the performance of the Grande Bande ostensibly on the grounds of their sloppiness and undisciplined use of ornaments. In actuality, Lully probably wanted a group of his own to test his ideas of orchestral performance techniques, which twenty years later were to make his opera orchestra the envy of all Europe. The Petits Violons appeared for the first time under Lully's direction in the court ballet La Galanterie du temps (1656), and, for six years, the new group was used almost to the exclusion of the Vingt-quatre Violons. After 1661 Lully apparently reconciled his differences with the Grande Bande, and the ensembles were even combined from time to time for special court performances. The Petits Violons were suppressed about 1715, but the Vingt-quatre Violons continued in existence until 1761. The division of labor between the two groups is difficult to determine. However, in an extract from the État de la France5 for the year 1686, Prunières discovered the following: The Grande Bande of the Vingt-quatre Violons, always so labeled although they are at present twenty-five . . . plays for the dinner of the King, for Ballets and for Comedies. The Petits\n\nMusic of the Great Stable For the man in the street in the twentieth century, the word stable evokes a dark and malodorous place. For the seventeenth-century man who gazed at the magnificent, semicircular stables at Versailles built by Hardouin-Mansart in 1682, the Great Stable meant much more than housing for the king's horses. Among the many officiers du roi attached to the Great Stable were the musicians traditionally associated with military and outdoor pageantry. These musicians were some of Louis XIV's best wind, brass, and timpani players, who orchestrated the pomp and ceremony of court life: the royal births, marriages, and funerals; the heralding of the king's arrival in towns and villages throughout the realm; and the welcoming of such foreign dignitaries as the envoys from Siam in 1686 and the Persian ambassadors in 1715. They crossed administrative boundaries to join the musicians of the Chamber in performances of ballets and divertissements, or to join the musicians of the Royal Chapel in performances of grands motets. They were available for parades, carrousels (equestrian ballets organized at court, generally on allegorical subjects) and other outdoor fêtes. They accompanied the king to parliament; their fanfares were heard both on the battlefield and at the hunt. The people reveled in the sight of the colorful, mounted trumpeters whose remote descendants in the Garde Républicaine quicken the pulse of parade watchers today as they play their trumpets at a gallop down the Champs-Élysées on Bastille Day.\n\nCreated with Print2PDF. To remove this line, buy a license at: http://www.binarynow.com/\n\nFrom the 1540s, the instrumentalists of the Stable were already grouped into three categories including twelve, five, and sevenmusicians, respectively: (1) saqueboutes et joueurs d'instruments (sackbuts and instrumentalists), (2) fiffres et tabourins (fifes and drums), and (3) trompettes (see Écorcheville 19001901). Although joueurs d'instruments originally referred in the main to wind instruments (oboes and cornetts), violinists were also included in the music of the Stable, which reminds us that at that time the violin was considered appropriate for music en plein air. As we have already seen, however, most bowed strings were transferred from the Stable to the Chamber by 1571. 6 By 1571 the Stable had at its disposal twelve trumpets, eight fifes and drums, fifteen sackbuts, oboes, and cornetts, one musette, and, according to Henry Prunières, one \"undetermined player.\" The divisions remained essentially the same under Louis XIV. In the État des officiers de la Maison du Roi for 1689 (see Benoit 1971a, 121), the following administrative units of the Stable are itemized: trompettes (twelve players); joueurs de violon, hautbois, saqueboutes et cornets (twelve players); hautbois et musettes de Poictou (six players); joueurs de fifres et tambour (eight players); and cromornes et trompettes marines (six players). Tradition apparently decreed that the administrative title of each category remain fixed long after certain instruments had fallen out of favor. Sackbuts, for example, were no longer employed during the period of Louis XIV, cornetts were used primarily to double the sopranos of the Royal Chapel, and crumhorns (cromornes) were used sparingly in some court ballets. On the other hand, the trumpet marine (trompette marine), the large, one-stringed, bowed instrument favored by Monsieur Jourdain, had its following to the middle years of the eighteenth century. The four best trumpet players, the trompettes ordinaires, were always expected to be available and to precede the royal coach on horseback in uniform. The eight remaining were used for performances of Te Deums, funerals, coronations, arrivals of visiting dignitaries, and the like. The category \"sackbuts and instrumentalists\" included some of the best performers who were prepared to play on a variety of wind instruments. In the second half of the seventeenth century, the category became known as the Douze Grands Hautbois. These were actually ten (not twelve) instruments of the oboe family and two bassoons. They had only three official functions a year to meet: the rising (lever) of the king on the first day of January and May, and on 24 August for Saint Louis's day. The remainder of the time they combined with other groups, such as the Vingt-quatre Violons, for performances of court ballets, divertissements, operas, and so forth. The music of the Stable entered a long decline after 1690. Jules Écorcheville estimates that there were scarcely six or eight musicians out of forty-three who served effectively by the time of the Regency. Yet, even at the end of his long life, Louis XIV took some comfort from their music, and \"on Saint Louis's day, 1715, a few days before his death, the drums and oboes [of the Great Stable] were in place under his window\" (Écorcheville 19001901, 641). In truth, the significance of the Great Stable to a history of French Baroque music does not lie with its spectacular \"orchestration\" of the ceremonies, the carrousels, and fêtes performed for the pleasure of the king and the royal family; its historical function, in retrospect, was to provide an invaluable proving ground for the great family dynasties of wind players. Generations of Hotteterres and Philidors were blessed with economic security and ample opportunity for extensive performance on their chosen instruments. This in turn not only led to the betterment of performance techniques, but also, and most importantly, it stimulated needed reforms in the construction of the instruments themselves to the point that, soon after the turn of the century, French oboes and flutes were the most admired in Europe. Music of the Royal Chapel At the time François I ascended the throne (1515), he inherited from his predecessor, Louis XII, a Royal Chapel that was \"impressive in both size and quality\" (see Brobeck 1995, 188) It changed little during the late sixteenth and early seventeenth centuries. In principle, it was a stronghold of musical conservatism and thereby merely reflected the state of religious music in France until Louis\n\nCreated with Print2PDF.

As late as 1645, when Guillaume du Peyrat published his formidable Histoire ecclésiastique de la cour ou les antiquitez et recherches de la chapelle et oratoire du Roy de France depuis Clovis Ier jusques à nostre temps, divisée en trois livres (Ecclesiastical history of the court, or Early histories and studies of the chapel and oratory of the King of France from Clovis the First to our time, divided into three books), the Royal Chapel consisted of \"two sous-maîtres, six boy sopranos, a first cornettist [cornet ordinaire], another cornettist, two falsettists [dessus mués], eight basses, eight tenors, eight hautescontres, 7 eight chaplains, four chapel clerks and two grammar instructors for the children\" (482). The important post of sous-maître, which also could carry the title Compositeur de la Chapelle, had authority comparable to the Surintendant de la Musique de la Chambre. The sous-maître trained the choir and chose and composed music for the king's Mass and other important ceremonies. His immediate superior's position, Maître de la Chapelle, was usually an honorary appointment to the Royal Chapel and given to a highly placed ecclesiastic, such as the Archbishop of Paris or of Rheims, rather than to a musician. In 1678 the Treaty of Nijmegen, which made Louis XIV the most powerful of Europe's monarchs for the next decade, gave him some respite from following his armies. At this time, he turned his attention to the transformation of Versailles, which had begun as early as 1661, and to his Royal Chapel. The first chapel at Versailles was the chapel opposite the kitchens, dating from 1663 to 1670 and little larger than a salon; the second, a large one-storied salon located in the queen's wing, existed from 1670 to 1673. A third chapel was built in the king's wing on the site of the Salle du Sacré and was used from 1673 to 1682. The fourth chapel was inaugurated in 1682 when the king and his court made their permanent residence at Versailles. It was designed on two levels and was located in the king's wing on the site of the present Salon d'Hercule. 8 The magnificent final chapel, begun by Hardouin-Mansart and completed by Robert de Cotte, dates from the end of the aging monarch's rule (1710). The grand motet, the ne plus ultra of French Baroque religious music, owes its very existence to the king's concept of music appropriate for the chapel of Europe's most powerful monarch. The 1708 État de la France lists, under ''Musique de la Chapelle,\" eleven sopranos, eighteen hautescontres, twenty-three tenors, twenty-four baritones, and fourteen basses (Morby 1971, 226). This suggests that the balance of the soprano section was made up of the young male pages assigned to the Chapel but not carried on the official roles in the seventeenth century. Cornetts were employed when necessary to lend support to the soprano section. Male sopranos, then, included falsettists, castrati (called dessus italiens), and boys. The role of female singers at the Royal Chapel in the period of Louis XIV has not been well researched. According to Norbert Dufourcq, women \"seem to have been introduced to the Royal Chapel at the time of Lully.\"9 However, none were registered as officiers in the seventeenth century, so their names do not appear in the archives. Evidence of their presence lies in certain of the grands motets of Delalande gathered and copied in Philidor's atelier in 1689 and 1690. In Exaudi Deus deprecationem, for example, the copyist identified a \"Mlle Delalande\" as the singer of a twelve-measure soprano solo in the opening chorus. Jacques Bonnet certainly acknowledged the presence of female singers when he wrote, in 1715, that \"the King's Music is ordinarily composed of 100 or 120 male and female musicians under the jurisdiction of the Maître de la Musique de la Chapelle\" (423424). Instrumentalists, labeled symphonists or concertants, infiltrated the Royal Chapel in the late 1660s, due, perhaps, to the influence of early grands motets by Lully such as the Miserere of 1664, which was particularly favored by the king. The instrumentalists were never carried on the official lists of the États des officiers de la Maison du Roi pertaining to the Royal Chapel; no one would have dared create official Chapel positions for these\n\nCreated with Print2PDF.

Nonetheless, the 1708 État de la France enumerates the following instrumentalists for the \"Musique de la Chapelle\": six violins and violas, three bass violins, one \"grosse basse de violon,\" one theorbo, two flutes, two oboes, one bass crumhorn, two serpents, and one bassoon. 10 In 1678, the king established a competition to choose four organists for his Chapel where there had previously been but one. The winners were Guillaume-Gabriel Nivers, Nicolas-Antoine Lebègue, Jacques Thomelin, and Jean-Baptiste Buterne. Succeeding his teacher, Thomelin, in 1693, François Couperin held this post until 1730. The salary of six hundred livres for each quarter was second only to that of the sous-maîtres, yet the only organs at Versailles appear to have been modest, positive instruments until the completion in 1709 of the grand orgue built by Étienne Enoc and Robert Clicquot. From the sixteenth century to the Revolution, the kings of France were to demand, for their own Chapel, the best singers from Paris churches, such as Notre-Dame and the Sainte-Chapelle. Often the choir directors of the churches in Paris were themselves members of the Royal Chapel, which brought about an irregularity of service in their own parishes.11 At the Sainte-Chapelle responsibility for the direction of the choir and the composition of the music lay with the Maître de Musique des Enfants, a position held by Marc-Antoine Charpentier for the last six years of his life. The broad lines of demarcation placed between institutions constituting the king's music were artificial. They served administrative ends only. Members of each institution passed freely from one group to another, and several smaller, more nebulous groups were also marked for performance. Thus, the oboes that played at balls and divertissements might be drawn from the two companies of musketeers quartered at Versailles, each of whom boasted four oboists and six drummers. Trumpets could be supplied by the Stable as well as by the Trompettes des Menus Plaisirs, who were players drawn from the king's corps of bodyguards. Performances by combined groups were common, especially for such ceremonies as coronations, royal births and deaths, marriages, and so on. Once a year on Saint Louis's eve, free public concerts were held in the Tuileries gardens. At this time the Vingt-quatre Violons, the trumpets and drums of the Great Stable, and the orchestra of the Académie Royale de Musique all joined together. In a sense it was the king's gift to the city of Paris, and for the poor of the teeming metropolis, it was a rare opportunity to catch a glimpse of delights taken for granted by the rich. The thrust of the crowds was such that on one occasion, we read in the Mercure of August 1719, 12 \"After the fireworks, the crowd pushing to the gates of the Tuileries was so great that it cost the lives of six or eight women who were suffocated or crushed to death\" (168). Before taking leave of the king's music, we should acknowledge the role of Philidor, l'âiné (the elder), whose atelier preserved in manuscript so much of the music heard at Versailles during the reign of Louis XIV. André Danican Philidor, l'âiné (ca. 16521730), was the Garde de la Bibliothèque de la Musique du Roi. He served in the same capacity for the Count of Toulouse, Louis XIV's son by Mme de Montespan. We do not know when Philidor officially was appointed the king's music librarian. The archives do not show payment to him or to his atelier before 1684. Who were the copyists who worked side by side with Philidor? We know four by name: violinist François Fossard; Philidor's sonin-law, Jean-Louis Schwartzenberg, called Le Noble; one of the three known Ferriers who were wind players at the court; and the eldest of Philidor's twenty-one children, his son Anne Danican Philidor. We know that, at times, the atelier employed at least nine copyists in addition to Philidor and Fossard. Marcelle Benoit noted the following record of payment under the \"comptes de la maison du roi\" for the year 1697: \"126 livres to Fossard and Philidor for nine copyists who worked for three days and two nights to copy the music of the pastorale ISSÉ by le sieur Destouches.\"13 The Town's Music J'entends déjà par tout les charrettes courir, Les massons travailler, les boutiques s'ouvrir; Tandis que dans les airs mille cloches émues,\n\nCreated with Print2PDF.

I already hear the carts rolling everywhere, The masons working, the shops opening; While in the air a thousand bells, touched by the emotion Of a funeral concert, make the clouds resound, And mingling with the noise of hail and winds To honor the dead, make the living die. The music of Paris\n\nin the grand siècle was more than the sound of Lully's orchestra at the Académie Royale de Musique, more than a Charpentier Te Deum at the Sainte-Chapelle or a Couperin organ Mass at Saint-Gervais. It was the music of mille cloches (a thousand church bells), the music of the street punctuated by the cries of the hawkers. \"There is not a city in the world,\" wrote Louis-Sébastien Mercier in his Tableau de Paris (1781), \"where street sellers possess shriller or more piercing voices. . . . Sounds from their gullets drown out the noise and din of city squares\" (cited by Lacroix 1875, 335). Paris in the seventeenth century was still very much a medieval city: noisy, crowded, and malodorous. The stench of refuse from Les Halles was no respecter of royalty housed in the dark and uncomfortable apartments of the nearby Louvre. In 1706, according to the king's chief engineer, Sébastien Le Prestre de Vauban, the greater metropolitan area had 856,938 souls, and to Charles de Secondat, Baron de Montesquieu's Persian it must have seemed that all of them were concentrated in the center of town: The houses are so high here, that one would judge them to be occupied only by astrologers. You well know that a city built in the air, which has six or seven houses one on top of the other, is extremely crowded, and that, when everybody goes down into the streets, there is great confusion (Montesquieu. 1721. \"Lettre XXIV.\" In Lettres persanes). Yet the music of the\n\nstreets was also heard in the sounds of the king's masons and carpenters at work lifting the face of the old city and creating, for an eternity to admire, the monuments of the age of Louis XIV. There was geometry in André Le Nôtre's garden of the Tuileries and in the closed forms of the royal squares (Place des Victoires and Place Louis-le-Grand). The classicism of Claude Perrault's colonnade of the Louvre was softened by Italian decoration. In the church of the Val-de-Grâce, the College of Mazarin, and the chapel of the Invalides, Italian Baroque exuberance was restrained by the same French classical spirit. Much of the musical life of the city centered on an area bounded on the north by Les Halles, on the east by Saint-Gervais at the entrance to the Marais, on the west by the Tuileries, and on the south, across the Seine, by Saint-Severin and the Latin Quarter. Here were the most important churches: Saint-Merri, Saint-Gervais, Saint-Germain-l'Auxerrois, the Oratoire, Saint-Jean-en-Grève, Saint-Jacquesde-la-Boucherie, Notre Dame, the Sainte-Chapelle, and Saint-Severin. Within the same area were the Académie Royale de Musique and the home of the Concert Spirituel and the Concerts Italiens. Here too were the shops of the makers of stringed instruments (luthiers) and the builders of harpsichords and organs; and here in Montesquieu's \"city built in the air,\" bordering on the Rue Saint-Martin near the hospital of Saint-Julien-des-Ménétriers, lived most of the musicians of the Confrérie of Saint-Julien. Confrérie de Saint-Julien-desMénétriers From 1321, when thirty-seven minstrels registered with the Provost of Paris to establish a musicians' guild, there was powerful, paternalistic protection for Parisian \"maîtres à danser et joueurs d'instruments tant haut que bas\" (dancing masters and the players of instruments both loud and soft). During the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, the purpose of the group was to protect its members against exploitation and to assure equal profit sharing. The articles governing the corporation, many of which are found in the documents of the Minutier Central, assured a remarkable degree of protection for the members of what was, in actuality, one of the first musicians' unions. If engaged for an aubade (or réveila dawn serenade), for example, members were supposed to share their profits with those who did not\n\nCreated with Print2PDF.

All were required to give an accurate report of their earnings under pain of expulsion, and the members even enjoyed a type of medical insurance whereby those who were sick would be paid \"as if they had worked\" unless the illness were reported to be \"shameful\" (honteuse). 14 The leader of the Confrérie was known as the Roi des Ménétriers and, later in the seventeenth century, as the Roi des Violons. The high point of the syndicate, both quantitatively and qualitatively, was reached in the late years of the sixteenth century and the early years of the seventeenth before the exodus of many of the best players from the Confrérie to the king's Chamber. The pages of the Minutier Central are filled with documentation of the syndicate's activities. It is curious that a series of legal papers, couched in the abstruse, archaic language of minor functionaries, can make flesh and blood of the Parisian joueurs d'instruments. The din and clamor of street life, the hand-to-mouth existence of these often illiterate musicians, are all recorded here. One can imagine the torrent of abuse and invectivethe result of the frustrations of daily livingthat must have motivated an item of 17 July 1602 whereby, if any member of the association \"swears and blasphemes the name of God in anger or otherwise, or picks a quarrel with anyone else, in such a case the said individual must pay to the injured the sum of two crowns\" (see Jurgens 1969). For the town musician who was called upon to perform for weddings, engagement parties, banquets, masquerades, dawn and evening street serenades, and formal concerts, the notarized contracts were designed for protection from his fellows as much as from any outside exploitation. Thus, the eleven joueurs d'instruments who in 1618 formed an association to play together for thirteen years levied a fine of sixteen sols should any member miss the scheduled Friday afternoon rehearsals. The contracts carefully spelled out these instruments and their designated performers; in one instance we read that this was done to make sure that no one would change his part \"without the consent of all his companions.\" After the midyears of the seventeenth century, with many of its best players now affluent members of the Vingt-quatre Violons du Roi, the Petits Violons, the Stable, or, after 1673, the Opera orchestra, the Confrérie declined in importance. It had become fat, lazy, and complacent; worse, it had been corrupted by power. Secure behind its impressive array of royal patents and notarized articles, it lashed out in a series of power plays to force an even greater number of musicians into its orbit of control. After the death of Louis Constantin in 1657, the Roi des Violons was the powerful Guillaume Dumanoir (16151697), who also signed himself \"Joueur de violon du Cabinet de Sa Majesté, l'un des Vingt-quatre Violons de sa Grande Bande, et pourvu aussi de l'office de Roy des joueurs d'instrumens et des maîtres à danser de France\" (Player in the Violons du Cabinet of His Majesty, one of the Twenty-four Violinists of his Grande Bande, and also has filled the post of King of instrumental players and masters of dance in France) (Dumanoir 1664; ed. of 1870, vii). In 1660 Guillaume I, as he was called with heavy sarcasm by Besche l'âiné, 15 was at the height of his power with some two hundred performers and composers under his command. He basked in the praise of Louis XIV (\"Notre très cher et bien-aimé Guillaume Dumanoir\"), yet one year later his fortune changed. The king effectively isolated him by appointing Lully to a position of unprecedented power, and thirteen of the Maîtres de Danse of the Confrérie actively revolted. In an operabuffa atmosphere of charge and countercharge (satirized by Molière in the maître de musique and the maître de danse scenes from Le Bourgeois gentilhomme), the dancers petitioned for a royal patent to establish an Académie Royale de Danse. Their success in March 1661 gave them a position of strength from which to woo others of their colleagues away from the strictures of the Confrérie. The statutes state that in the city and suburbs, other master teachers of dance can aspire to join the founders and be received into the Academy should they be judged \"worthy and capable.\" If a son of a dancer, they pay the sum of fifty livres; otherwise, they must pay three hundred livres. The insistence of \"Guillaume I\" that the new\n\nCreated with Print2PDF.

Typical is a Discours académique (Paris, 1663) prepared by the Académie Royale de Danse to prove that dance, in its nobility, has \"no need of Instruments of Music and that it is totally independent of the Violin\" (cited by Loubet de Sceaury 1949, 80). In a Pyrrhic victory of sorts, Dumanoir had the last word in his polemic of 1664, Le Mariage de la musique avec la dance: \"In a word, who does not know that the Dance is not, properly speaking, an Art, but only an exercise\" (ed. of 1870, 71). In 1668 \"Guillaume I\" relinquished his throne to his son, \"Guillaume II,\" who had learned little from his father's mistakes. The establishment of the Académie Royale de Musique in 1672 introduced a new, competitive element that worked to the disadvantage of the Confrérie. In a decree of 14 August 1673, Lully, who clearly took care of his own, gave his orchestral musicians permission to \"play for balls, weddings, serenades, and other public fêtes and to take the salary paid them without any harassment from the Maîtres [i.e., the Confrérie]\" (Loubet de Sceaury 1949, 99). This was the worst blow yet to the syndicate, for it found itself reduced to exercising its authority over café musicians from the bottom of the barrel. In a final bid for power, the Confrérie blurred the lines of distinction found on all patents between the maîtres à danser et joueurs d'instruments, on the one hand, for example, and the compositeurs de musique, organistes et professeurs de clavessin, on the other, in order to bring the latter group under the jurisdiction of the Confrérie. However, the \"composers of music, organists, and professors of harpsichord\" had no intention of submitting to the abusive restrictions of the syndicate. In a document, quoted by Écorcheville, entitled Raisons qui prouvent manifestement que les compositeurs et joueurs d'instruments d'harmonie ne peuvent être de la communauté des Ménestriers (Reasons which manifestly prove that composers and players of keyboard instruments cannot be members of the Ménétriers), they stated: The maîtres have taught violin to all the lackeys of Paris. They have played with riffraff [racaille] in order to get out of sharing profits with other maîtres. They have allowed most of their maîtres to play in cabarets against Article VI of their Statutes. They have accepted as maîtres all sorts of vagabonds and even coachmen to whom they have issued false credentials, although they have never filled a term of apprenticeship in the home of a maître (1906c, 28). Even religious organizations recognized the\n\npotential threat to their organists and composers. In a letter of 1692 addressed to the Lieutenant General of Police, a certain Sister Marguerite de Jésus of the Couvent de la Croix in the Faubourg Saint-Antoine wrote: \"It takes only three or four years to master dance and violin playing. It takes fifteen and twenty years to form organists and to learn how to play the harpsichord\" (Benoit and Dufourcq 1957, 42). The king's organists, Lebègue, Nivers, Buterne, and François Couperin, petitioned the king for Lettres Patentes which would permanently remove the threat of coercion and economic privation initiated by the Confrérie. The king supported his organists and, in a royal patent of 25 June 1707, dealt a crushing blow to the Confrérie of Saint-Julien. The Lettres Patentes read, in part: Wishing to treat favorably the organists of our chapel and others, who make their living teaching composition, and performers of the above mentioned instruments d'harmonie, and to maintain them in the free exercise of their profession, We have, by these presents, signed by Our hand . . . forbidden the so-called maîtres à danser, joueurs d'instruments tant haut que bas et hautbois, to trouble the petitioners in the exercise of their profession (Dumanoir 1664; ed. of 1870, 117). Ringing words, these, to emanate from an absolute monarch, and in the opinion of\n\nBesche, \"the Organists of the King and those of the Capital were the first to undertake the defence of freedom in the Musical Art\" (1774, 8). The Confrérie, now a butt of musical jokes, was immortalized a few years later (1717) in the satiric program suite of François Couperin, \"Les Fastes de la grande et ancienne Mxnxstrxndxsx\" (Ménestrandise). In summary, however, it should be emphasized that the Confrérie had served an important role in the history of French instrumental music. In their best days members not only kept their ranks filled by means of a careful system of apprenticeship, but they also trained fine performers who made up the bulk of the king's instrumentalists. By showing instrumental distributions between\n\nCreated with Print2PDF.

The Confrérie de Saint-Julien-des-Ménétriers \"had suffered diverse fortunes\" since its founding in the fourteenth century as Écorcheville points out, \"but its church, its hospital, a concert hall, and, above all, a solid syndical organization still rendered service to those whose métier was music\" (1906c, 21). 16 Académie Royale de Musique 17 In the Lettres Patentes of 28 June 1669, Louis XIV accorded \"Our well-loved and faithful Pierre Perrin\" the sole privilege of establishing \"Académies d'Opéra\" in the realm for performances \"en Musique en langue françoise\" modeled on academies that had been established in Italy \"for several years'' (cited by Loubet de Sceaury 1949, 92). Little matter that there were no such royal academies for the performance of opera in Italy or in Germany and England as Perrin had claimed. He had touched a point of national pride in Colbert and maneuvered the creation of yet another institution. Perrin now had a guaranteed, twelve-year dictatorship over opera production in France. The sordid tale of his misadventures (see Chapter 6) reached a climax with the unfortunate man's imprisonment for debt. Impatiently awaiting just such a chance was Jean-Baptiste Lully, who had committed one of the few errors of judgment in his career by refusing to believe that the French wanted a national opera. Now, acting with dispatch, Lully purchased the entire privilege from Perrin, promising him a pension for life and paying him a sum sufficient to repay his creditors and to be released from debtor's prison. The king was informed of this move, presumably by Mme de Montespan, and before 16 March 1672 he formally transferred the privilege to his Surintendant de Musique: \"In order to assure greater success, We believed it appropriate to give control (of the opera) to an individual whose experience and capacity We know well . . . \" (cited by Loubet de Sceaury 1949, 93). To avoid duplication and perhaps to assure a fresh beginning, the king changed the name of the organization from the Académies d'Opéra to the Académie Royale de Musique, and further, he extended the privilege from a dozen years to the lifetime of Lully and his heirs. In actuality after Lully's death, the privilege passed in and out of the hands of Jean-Nicolas Francine, Lully's son-in-law, until his retirement in 1728, when the opera came under the direction of André Cardinal Destouches, who was followed in quick succession by Gruer in 1730, Lecomte in 1731, Armand-Eugène de Thuret in 1733, and François Berger from 1744 to 1747. More clever and more ruthless than Perrin, Lully succeeded in obtaining additional, repressive patents that assured him absolute power over French stage music and effectively immobilized potential rivals (see Chapter 5). In Jacques-Bernard Durey de Noinville's Histoire du théâtre de l'Académie Royale de Musique en France, we may read the many articles issued by the king at Versailles and Marly in 1713 and 1714 to assure more effective administrative control over the Paris Opera. These regulations obviously grew from the smooth-running and efficient organization that Lully had made of the Académie Royale de Musique. Among other items we learn that free schools of music and dance were established (Article II); a lucrative pension system for singers and dancers was created (Article XIII); and medical coverage was provided, assuring a pension to those \"crippled in the service of the Opera\" (Article XLI). For almost one hundred years (16741763) the home of French opera was the Grande Salle of the Palais Royal that had been occupied by Molière's troupe at the time of that great playwright's death in 1673. Inaugurated in 1641, the hall was one of two built for Cardinal Richelieu in the Palais Royal (known also as the Palais Cardinal). Lully modified it with the 3000 livres given to him by Louis XIV. It was renovated in 1732 and again in 1749, then destroyed by fire in 1763. Barely satisfactory for the type of spectacle envisioned by Lully and later by Rameau, it was much longer than wide with a parterre, a\n\nCreated with Print2PDF.

Henri Lagrave (1972, 86) estimated that the hall would accommodate between 1300 and 1400 spectators, although there were only 1270 seats. Its stage was small. From the English translation of Luigi Riccoboni's Réflexions historiques et critiques sur les différens théâtres de l'Europe (1738), we read: The Decorations of the Stage of the Opera are very handsome, but not to be compared with those of Italy, the Smallness of the Stage not admitting of their being either so large or so magnificent as those of the vast Theaters of Venice, Milan, etc. (1741, 152). In his satiric pamphlet of 1753, the Baron F. W. von Grimm had his \"petit prophète\n\nde Boehmisch-Broda\" describe the Paris Opera as a marionette theater. Charles De Brosses, after visiting Naples in 1739, commented that the stage alone of San Carlo was larger than the entire Paris Opera (see Paul-Marie Masson 1930, 117). The price remained fairly uniform and was \"double that of any other Entertainment, in proportion to the Preference of Places\" according to Riccoboni (1741, 153). Writing in his preface to Volume 6 of Rameau's complete works (Oeuvres complètes de J.-P, Rameau 1900, xxv), Charles Malherbe informs us that at the beginning of the eighteenth century, admission to the balcony or on the stage was eleven livres, ten sols; seven livres, four sols for the first loges and gallery; three livres, twelve sols for the second loges; one livre, sixteen sols for the third loges (the Paradis) and the parterre. The printed livret (libretto) was sold for thirty sols at the door of the theater before each performance. Joachim Christoph Nemeitz, an affluent German traveler, included much information in his Séjour de Paris (1727) regarding the Paris musical scene of the 1720s as seen through the eyes of a class-conscious young galant. In his \"faithful Instruction for Travelers of Means,\" he ranked seating arrangements in the Paris theaters as follows: At the Comedies [Comédie Française and Comédie Italienne] a man of quality takes his place on the Stage and in one of the first Loges, or in the Parterre, if there are not too many people. But rarely in the second Loge which is for the bourgeois, and never in the Amphitheater where all sorts of riffraff are assembled. But the Amphitheater of the Opera is honorable and has the rank of the first Loge. The second Loge is still passable. But no one would willingly seat himself in the alleged Paradis, excepting the Balcony which is on the side. The Balcony, below, to the side of the stage, is for gentlemen of distinction and costs ten livres per person. But the Parterre is sometimes visited by people even of the first quality, since one has the advantage there of being able to enter or to leave freely without disturbing anyone. When one is in the Parterre of the Comédie or the Opera, one takes care to whistle at some Actor or to clap his hands in order to mock him. This gives rise sometimes to disagreements (1727, 105). In general, tragédies lyriques (called tragédies en musique at that\n\ntime) and opéras-ballets were performed at five o'clock in the afternoon on Sundays, Tuesdays, Thursdays, and Fridays during the winter; the summer schedule omitted Thursday performances. Out of deference to the wishes of the church, the Opera closed twenty-three days during the Easter season and eleven days annually for solemn religious feasts. In 1712 Louis XIV ordered the construction of the Magasin, an annex to the Académie Royale de Musique, which provided rehearsal space, schools of singing and dance, administrative offices, a library, and a ballroom. In 1715 the Académie Royale de Musique received permission to sponsor public balls in the theater from 11 November until Advent and from Epiphany to Shrove Tuesday. The royal patent specifically stated that \"His Majesty very expressly forbade entrance to anyone who is not masked.\" According to Durey de Noinville, the balls began at eleven o'clock at night and ended at six or seven o'clock the next morning. Thirty musicians assembled half an hour before the dancing commenced to give a concert \"of large-scale pieces of instrumental music [symphonie] by the best masters\" (1757, 1:164). The Concert Spirituel 18 \"The taste for music,\" we read in the Mercure de France, \"has never been so universal. In Paris and in the smallest provincial towns, Concerts and Academies of Music have been maintained at considerable cost, and new ones are established each day\" (April 1727, 747). The first permanent concert organization to give series of subscription concerts on a\n\nCreated with Print2PDF.

It was the Concert Spirituel founded in 1725 by Anne Danican Philidor (16811728), the eldest son of André Danican Philidor, l'âiné. In order to circumvent the notorious privilege created for Lully that prevented anyone without written permission from singing any piece in its entirety whether in French or other languages, Philidor agreed to pay the sum of ten thousand livres per year for three years to Francine, administrative head of the Académie Royale de Musique and Lully's son-in-law. Philidor further agreed to prevent the performance of operatic fragments or pieces with French texts. The concerts took place on religious holidays when the Académie Royale de Musique was closed. Durey de Noinville (1757, 170) stated that this amounted to about twenty-four concerts a year and included the following feast days: Feast of the Purification of the Virgin (2 February), Feast of the Annunciation (25 March), from Passion Sunday (two Sundays before Easter) to Quasimodo (one Sunday after Easter) inclusive, Ascension Day, Pentecost, Corpus Christi, Feast of the Assumption of the Virgin (15 August), Nativity of the Virgin (8 September), All Saints Day (1 November), Conception of the Virgin (8 December), Christmas Eve, and Christmas Day. The inaugural concert was held on 18 March (Passion Sunday) 1725 in the Salle des Suisses of the Tuileries Palace. This hall was a gift from Louis XV and remained the home of the Concert Spirituel until 1784. The first program included a suite of airs for strings by Delalande; the grands motets Confitebor tibi and Cantate Domino, also by Delalande; and the \"Christmas\" Concerto (Opus 6, No. 8) by Arcangelo Corelli. The performers at the Concert Spirituel were usually first-rate; the vocal soloists came from the Opera, and the chorus was made up of some of the best singers of the Royal Chapel and the principal churches of Paris. Motets by Lully, Nicolas Bernier, Louis Marchand, Destouches, Jean-François Lalouette, Jean Gilles, François Petouille, Henry Desmarest, Michel Pignolet de Montéclair, Louis-Antoine Dornel, François Colin de Blamont, André Campra, and many others were performed; but throughout the history of the Concert Spirituel, the motets of Delalande remained the examples of this genre most in demand. Like the early history of the Opéra Comique, the story of the Concert Spirituel is that of an organization acclaimed by audiences and performers alike, yet beset by financial woes and impossible restrictions brought about, in part, by jealous rivals. Philidor resigned in 1728 a few months before his death, and the enterprise was taken over by Michel Delannoy, Pierre Simart, and the composer Jean-Joseph Mouret. During this administration, the complexion of the concerts changed somewhat: Italian performers and compositions were much in vogue; instrumental music began to achieve a significance that would contribute substantially to the development of the sonata and the concerto in France. Among the violinists were Jean-Baptiste Anet, a student of Corelli's, and Jean-Pierre Guignon, the Roi des Violons who specialized in the sonatas and concertos of Antonio Vivaldi and who was rivaled at the concerts by the great French composer-performer, Jean-Marie Leclair. Financially, this administration fared no better than that of Philidor, and on 25 December 1734, the Académie Royale de Musique moved in to take control of the Concert Spirituel. The musical direction was wisely given to violinist-composer Jean-Féry Rebel and to François Francolar. Although each concert included at least one grand motet, the main significance of the Concert Spirituel lay more and more in the domain of instrumental music. Each program contained at least one sonata or concerto for violin played by Guignon or Leclair, and Italian and German symphonies began to appear on the programs in the late 1740s. Under the direction of Joseph-Nicolas-Pancrace Royer, Gabriel Capperan, and, after the death of Royer in 1755, Joseph Cassanéa de Mondonville, the instrumental and vocal forces of the Concert Spirituel (according to Durey de Noinville 1757, 173176) were as follows: vocal soloists included four sopranos, one hautecontre, and three baritones; and the chorus was made up of twelve sopranos, fourteen hautescontres, seven tenors, and five lower voices (basses and baritones). The particular distribution of parts demonstrates the domination of the haute-contre over the tenor in French vocal\n\nCreated with Print2PDF.

The Symphonie consisted of sixteen violins, two violas, six basses, two double basses, five flutes and oboes, and three bassoons. This reflects the strong emphasis on treble and bass instruments that characterized French scoring practices during the same period. The Concert Spirituel existed for sixty-six years. It provided an important forum for new music: vocal and instrumental, religious and secular. It thereby contributed in no small way to the formation of new musical attitudes on the part of French composers, performers, and consumers of music in the eighteenth century. Coexisting with the Concert Spirituel in its early days were two additional concert series: the so-called Concerts Français and the Concerts Italiens. Philidor established the Concerts Français just six months before his resignation from the directorship of the Concert Spirituel. Its concerts were held in the Tuileries on Saturdays and Sundays during the winter season. This series had a big advantage in having obtained the services of two of the best singers at the Opera: Mlle Catherine-Nicole Le Maure and Mlle Marie Antier. The programs included divertissements and cantatas, for the most part in French. Over one hundred concerts were given from 1727 to November 1730, when, except for scattered concerts, the series terminated. 19 The Concerts Français competed directly with the Concerts Italiens (founded in 1724 by Pierre Crozat and the Marquise de Prie), which also gave subscription concerts in the Tuileriestheirs on Thursdays and Saturdays. We learn from Titon du Tillet that at the Concerts Italiens: They only performed Italian music; they were almost entirely Italian musicians, with some Frenchmen who had been in Italy . . . Several Amateurs de la Musique Italienne . . . , such as M. Crozat, M. Gaudiori, Guardian of the Royal Treasury, and others, established this Concert [series], whose expenses they underwrote (1732, 677). Thus\n\nwas inaugurated the age of the wealthy middle-class entrepreneur that reached its height in Rameau's sponsor, the financier Alexandre-Jean-Joseph Le Riche de La Pouplinière (16931762). Financier Antoine Crozat (16551738), whom Saint-Simon deemed \"the richest man in Paris,\" gave concerts at his home on the Rue de Richelieu from 1715 to 1724 (Daval 1961, 114). Then, for thirty-one years (17311762), private concerts under the financial direction of La Pouplinière presented to the Parisian musical world some of the most important performers and compositions of the period.\n\nPART ONE STAGE MUSIC\n\nChapter 2 Ballet de Cour I: From Beaujoyeulx to Lully On the evening of 15 October 1581 from ten at night to half past three in the morning, the Balet comique de la Royne (as the title was originally written) was performed at the Petit Bourbon palace in Paris. This first court ballet 1 was part of the second day's festivities celebrating the marriage of the Duc de Joyeuse and the queen's sister, Marguerite de Vaudémont. There is no evidence that the spectators, numbering in an\n\nCreated with Print2PDF.

To all appearances, the Ballet comique de la reine (as it was later referred to) was one more ambitious fête in the tradition of sixteenth-century entertainments at the court of the Valois kings. The mythological personages, the nymphs and satyrs, the political allusions, the eulogies of the monarch, and the elaborate machinery had their counterparts in earlier fêtes at Fontainebleau and Bayonne, which, in their turn, had been modeled on Italian masquerades and pastorales. Two immediate forerunners of the Ballet comique de la reine were the divertissement Le Paradis d'amour and the Ballet des Polonais. Le Paradis d'amour (text by Pierre de Ronsard) was presented on 20 August 1572 as part of the celebration of the marriage of Henri de Navarre and Marguerite de Valois. On the night of 19 August 1573, sixteen royal ladies representing the sixteen provinces of France danced the Ballet des Polonais, which Catherine de Médici had commissioned from Beaujoyeulx to honor the Polish ambassadors. In its allegorical character, its vocal solos, its machinery, and its dancing, Le Paradis d'amour evokes much of the same atmosphere as the later Ballet comique de la reine. More importantly, this episodic ballet does have a central plot in which allegory had the Huguenot bridegroom and his followers sent to Hell by the Catholic defenders of Paradise: Charles IX and his brothers. A fateful acting-out of the smoldering hostilities exploded only four days after the performance in the Massacre of Saint Bartholomew's Eve (see Yates 1947, 254259). In spite of the unity of action exhibited by Le Paradis d'amour, it is the later, more elaborate Ballet comique de la reine that in the opinion of later aestheticians and historians deserves a significant place in the development of French dramatic music. Typical is the comment of Pierre-Louis d'Aquin de Château-Lyon, who described the Ballet comique as the first work in France to give \"some idea of the musical theater\" (1753, 1:156). For some, the Ballet comique was not only the first example of a dramatic representation in music and dance, it was also the first work of this genre to demonstrate the ubiquitous, albeit ill-defined, \"good taste\" or \"le bon goût\" of the seventeenth- and eighteenth-centuries (see, for example, Germain Boffrand 1715, 1:27). It is impossible to determine how many writers of later generations were actually familiar with the text and music of the Ballet comique and how many were echoing, often verbatim, the opinions of others. The 1582 edition printed in Paris by Adrian Le Roy, Robert Ballard, and Mamert Patisson was well known in later times. 2 Claude-François Ménestrier summarized the action and included textual fragments from it in his Des représentations en musique anciennes et modernes (1681). Charles Burney owned a copy, and Jean-Benjamin de La Borde in his Essai sur la musique ancienne et moderne (1780) mentioned its availability in the king's library. Did the brothers Claude and François Parfaict, those meticulous compilers of all manner of information on the French theater, write from direct observation when they invited all to \"read again the singing vers of the ballet of 1582 . . . you will observe there the birth of 'le bon goût,'\" or were they merely quoting Jean-Laurent Lecerf de la Viéville's work, where the identical sentence is found?3 In writing the 1582 preface, Beaujoyeulx was aware that he had indeed created an invention moderne, for he stated that \"never has a ballet been printed in which the word comique was employed\" (1582, \"Au lecteur\"). He saw the necessity of justifying his coupling of ballet and comique. It follows in this context that comique describes a work containing dramatic unity. In like manner did Saint-Hubert in his La Manière de composer et faire réussir les ballets (1641) define ballet as \"comédie muette,\" an apt description appropriated forty years later by Ménestrier in his Des ballets anciens et modernes. The Ballet comique de la reine had a clear relationship to the concept of humanism\n\nCreated with Print2PDF. To remove this line, buy a license at: http://www.binarynow.com/\n\nas formulated by the Pléiade and by Jean-Antoine de Baïf's Académie de Poésie et de Musique (which had become the Académie du Palais under Henri III). This is not surprising. The Duc de Joyeuse had been a financial supporter of Baïf's Académie; and Lambert Beaulieu, the chief composer of the Ballet comique, was closely associated with the cofounder of the Académie, Thibaud de Courville. The commendatory poem found at the beginning of the printed edition supports the humanistic mystique of the ballet in the lines: Et la façon tant estimée De nos poètes anciens, Les Vers avecques la musique, Le Balet confus mesuré, Démonstrant du ciel azuré L'Accord par un effect mystique. And the manner so esteemed Of our former poets The verses with music, The disordered ballet measured, Demonstrating accord From azure heavens by a mystical effect.\n\nThe syllabic choruses do resemble the vers mesuré à l'antique (see Example 2-1); and the carefully planned, geometric figures of the concluding grand ballet graphically represent the Pythagorean-Platonic bias of the Académie. In defining ballet in his preface as a \"geometric mingling of several dancers,\" Beaujoyeulx viewed his project as being within the humanistic milieu of the Académie (1582; rpt. 1971, \"Au lecteur\"). The Ballet comique owes its existence to many hands. The exact role of the Huguenot poet Agrippa d'Aubigny is still in doubt. He claimed to have been the real author of the ballet (see Yates 1947, 257). Most scholars, however, credit Beaujoyeulx with its master plan and the overall organization of the dances. Baltasar de Beaujoyeulx (born Baltazarini da Belgiojoso, died ca. 1587) arrived in France about 1555. According to Pierre Bourdeille, Seigneur de Brantôme, it was the Maréchal de Brissac who sent Beaujoyeulx from Piedmont with his ''bande de viollons très exquise\" to be employed by Catherine de Médici as a valet de chambre. Brantôme, who, it should be remembered, was a close personal friend of the musician, also informs us that Beaujoyeulx was the \"meilleur viollon de la chrestienté\" (cited by Prunières 1914, 78). Beaujoyeulx had arranged the dances in the Ballet des Polonais. Now he was assisted in the creation of the Ballet comique by Lambert Beaulieu and Jacques Salmon, who were responsible for the music. La Chesnaye wrote the text, and Jacques Patin, \"peintre du Roy,\" designed the stage sets and costumes. The 1582 edition reveals French lyric drama in embryo. There is a single line of dramatic action: to destroy the power of the enchantress, Circé, through the intervention of Mercury, Palls, Pan, and Jupiter in order to reestablish harmony, reason, and order. This theme is coupled with adulatory references to the kingpolitical propagandists and flatterers have been finding their own values in art for a long time. The extant music includes eight choruses (one a4, five a5, and two a6), two vocal solos, two duos with choral refrains, and two sets of instrumental dances. Accompaniments for the vocal solos and duos were not printed. The 1582 edition, which gives many details regarding the action and setting, is very vague concerning specific instrumentation. Flageolets, orgues doulces (soft organs), harps, lutes, lyres, oboes, cornetts, sackbuts, recorders, violons (generic term for all strings of the violin family), and \"aultres doux instrumens\" (other soft instruments) are mentioned throughout the score; and we are told that during the descent of Jupiter, forty musicians (vocalists and instrumentalists) performed in the voûte dorée (a could machine which was illuminated inside). The dances, scored in five-part texture, were performed by ten violons and constitute the earliest printed music of the violin family. The intrinsic musical value of the Ballet comique is not commensurate with its historical position. The choral music is square and rigidly homophonic, with only an occasional cross relation to\n\nCreated with Print2PDF.

The long dialogue between Glauque and Tethys is one of the earliest examples of declamatory singing in stage music, but the long melismas on inconsequential and unaccented words indicate a general lack of concern with either the rules of prosody or a dramatic rendering of the text. The components of a typical seventeenth-century court ballet are the following: récits, vers, entrées, and usually a concluding grand ballet. The word récit should not be confused with récitatif. As a generic term, it was used to characterize \"that which is sung by only one voice\" (Furetière 1690, 3:unpaged). Therefore, a récitatif is a particular type of récit. In the Baroque period, the term applied as well to passages for solo instruments such as a récit de viol. In the court ballet, récits were at first declaimed, but beginning with the Ballet de la reine of 1609 and the Ballet de Monseigneur le Duc de Vendôme of 1610, vocal solos substituted for declamation. Such récits generally occurred at the beginning of each section of the ballet and separated the ballet into acts. They were most often performed by characters who did not dance. Similar to the air de cour in structure and melodic shape, they commented on the dramatic action. It is important to emphasize that the vocal music of court ballets also included choruses and polyphonic airs as well as solo récits. These airs were provided by the most important composers of court airs, including Pierre Guédron, Antoine Boesset, and Étienne Moulinié. Boesset, for example, contributed over seventy polyphonic airs and solo récits to twenty-five court ballets (see Durosoir 1991, 240249). Vers pour les personnages were rhymed verses distributed among the spectators. They were included in the livre du ballet (later known as the livret) and occasionally contained indiscreet references to the royal dancers. The publication of detailed descriptions of the mise-en-scène and identification of the dancers in livrets became customary after 1610. Michel de Pure complained that the vers were the \"weakest and least important part of the ballet . . . an ornamental pastiche\" (1668, 296). Entrées, which separated the acts into scenes, began with the entry of elaborately costumed and masked dancers who were identified not only by their pantomime, their dances, and characteristic music, but also by the vers and récits. The danses de caractère, which made up many of the entrées, were dances believed to be characteristic of certain countries or regions. JeanBaptiste Dubos defined the term as referring to a dance whose \"melody and rhythm imitate a specific style and which is, therefore, assumed to be appropriate for certain peoples\" (1719; ed. of 1770, 3:184). Ménestrier commented in his Remarques pour la conduite des ballets that \"melody has different characteristics in different countries; it is heavy in Germany, serious and forceful in Spain, lively in Italy, and regular in France\" (1658; rpt. as appendix 1967, 224). The grand ballet, a forerunner of the operatic finale, concluded the ballet and was danced by the grands seigneurs and, at least once each year, by the king himself. It was distinguished from the other entrées by an \"atmosphère de luxe,\" often in marked contrast to the limited abilities of its dancers (La Laurencie 1920, 76). Michel de Pure, a witness of the collaboration between Lully and Benserade in the composition of court ballets, described the frustration of Lully, who was continually embarrassed by the \"stupidity of most of the grands\n\nCreated with Print2PDF.

The dancers, who generally remained masked throughout, were members of the court plus a few professionals in the service of the king. In \"ballets of the king,\" men took the roles of female characters; in \"ballets of the queen,\" women of the court were permitted to dance. From the late sixteenth century to the death of Lully in 1687, court ballets were performed in Paris at the Grande Salle of the Louvre, the Grand Salon of the Tuileries Palace, the Palais Royal, the Hôtel de Ville, and, until its destruction in 1660, at the Salle du Petit Bourbon (between the Louvre and the church of St.-Germain-l'Auxerrois). Outside Paris, performances took place at the royal chateaux at Compiègne, Fontainebleau, Chantilly, Vincennes, St.Germain-en-Laye, and Chambord. All court ballets resulted from the collaboration of a royal patron, poets for the vers and récits, at least two composers responsible for the vocal and instrumental music, and a machinist to plan and execute the elaborate stage machinery. The patron determined the subject matter (sujet) and the distribution of labor. The role of Louis XIII in the choice and treatment of the sujet must not be underestimated. In the Ballet de la Merlaison performed at Chantilly on 15 March 1635, the choreography, airs, and even the costumes were \"all the invention of His Majesty\" (Lacroix 1868, 5:113). The king also chose the subject for the Ballet de la délivrance de Renaud, performed on 29 January 1617, for which he created his own role as a demon of fire. This popular theme of deliverance, adapted from Tasso's Gerusalemme liberata, is also the subject of the Ballet de l'aventure de Tancrède en la forêt enchantée, which was performed in the Grande Salle of the Louvre on 12 February 1619. It took little imagination to interpret the combat of Tancrède and his cavaliers against the monsters of the enchanted forest as an allegorical representation of Louis XIII and his favorite grand seigneur, Charles d'Albert de Luynes, delivering France from her enemies. The Jesuits also were quick to realize the propaganda potential of ballet, and at Rheims in 1628 they mounted a production of La Conquête du char de la gloire in which giants of the black tower (Huguenots of La Rochelle) hold captive the knights, who are eventually liberated by the shepherd, Caspis (Richelieu), after Théandre (Louis XIII) has killed the dragon of the tower (see Chastel in Christout 1967, 3). Jacques de Gouy suggested, in the preface to his Airs à quatre parties sur la paraphrase des psaumes de Godeau (Paris 1650, fol. iii), that Louis XIII would have much preferred spending all his time in the preparation and performance of ballets if only the \"cares of governing so many people in such difficult times had allowed him leisure commensurate with his zeal.\" The appendix to the present book translates a description of the preparation of the Ballet du grand bal de la Douairière de Billebahaut danced by Louis XIII at the Hôtel de Ville in Paris on 25 February 1626. The order to prepare the Hôtel de Ville for this performance had been given by the king to his Conseiller d'État at the Louvre on 4 February, and all subordinates in the complex chain of command went feverishly to work to build the elaborate machines, construct platforms, and prepare the banquet halls and rooms of the Hôtel de Vil"
