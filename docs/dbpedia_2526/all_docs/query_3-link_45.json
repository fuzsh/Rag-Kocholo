He has requested input from other editors, and started a discussion at the reliable sources noticeboard: here. The first reviewer there stated that they could use some more input from some readers who have a good knowledge of the Bible. I thought maybe we could find some here at this project page. If you're interested in looking into this and providing outside opinions click the link.

It seems to be an idiom for abundance, like one's cup being filled with some presumably desirable drink so full that it's overflowing. What more is there to say?

You're receiving this message because your WikiProject or task force is signed up to receive the popular pages report. Every month, will post at Wikipedia:WikiProject Bible/Archive 7/Popular pages with a list of the most-viewed pages over the previous month that are within the scope of WikiProject Bible.\n\nWe've made some enhancements to the original report. Here's what's new:\n\nThe pageview data includes both desktop and mobile data.\n\nThe report will include a link to the pageviews tool for each article, to dig deeper into any surprises or anomalies.\n\nThe report will include the total pageviews for the entire project (including redirects).\n\nWe're grateful to for his original , and we wish his bot a happy robot retirement.

Specifically, multiple editors keep re-inserting claims such as the claim that The Book of numbers (5th century BCE) talks about Adolph Hitler. --Guy Macon (talk)\n\nAs one of the \"multiple editors\" (there's just two of us) mentioned here, I think this is a bad mischaracterization of the situation. But I would ask anyone who has the time to drop by Amalek and take a look. Alephb (talk)\n\nIn case anyone's interested, there is a Wikisource partial translation of the Bible, over at Wikisource:WikiProject Wiki Bible.\n\nThere's some conversations occurring at Translation talk:Genesis and Translation talk:Exodus where a third opinion from someone knowledgeable (even moderately knowledgeable) about biblical Hebrew would be helpful here. The conversations are between myself an an anonymous IP -- the only two active contributors that I know of to the project. We're talking really basic stuff -- the editor I'm trying to talk to has only a partial knowledge of the vowel-points in the Hebrew Bible, but can apparently speak Modern Israeli Hebrew and thinks that this completely substitutes for any knowledge of biblical Hebrew.\n\nFor a sampling of what the new editor is brining to the table, see [1] and much more here [2].\n\nOf course, for anyone who doesn't want to wade into this mess, there's also a number of totally untranslated sections that could use a look from anyone who knows their way around biblical Hebrew, ancient Aramaic, and Koine Greek. Alephb (talk)\n\nI am working on a total rewrite-- in my sandbox-- of an existing article that was flagged as needing it. I am wondering if I can put upon someone to give me a fair and honest assessment of the content before I go any further. I'm still pretty new here and haven't made any friends I can ask yet. The existing article is the Bible and Violence. I think the title needs changing because it is too broad, and it's meaning can be seen as ambiguous. I have gone with Violence in the Bible. That is actually what the article discusses. The article not only lacked sufficient inline references, it needed reorganizing. The entire existing article is subsumed in the rewrite. I left nothing out. I even checked and read up on his references. Everything he said is still there--it's just rearranged and either edited for conciseness or expanded and added to. I would especially like comments on including the section on apologetics--which contains the non-sectarian information--or combining them all into single paragraphs--or deleting it entirely...and whatever your reasoning on that might be. Please help me! I have already run into some vitriol on this. Jenhawk777 (talk) 06:25, 2 August 2017 (UTC)Jenhawk777 (talk)\n\nUser talk:Jenhawk777/sandboxJenhawk777 (talk)\n\nHello, User:Jenhawk777. I'd be happy to take a look and give you some thoughts, and I'll try to be polite. I'm sorry to hear there's been some vitriol. Discussions of the Bible on Wikipedia (or anywhere) have a way of getting that way. Alephb (talk)\n\nOn second thought, the link to your sandbox doesn't seem to lead to your draft. Has it been moved? Alephb (talk)\n\nOn third thought, I don't see any evidence that you've been editing over at The Bible and violence at all. Are you editing under multiple usernames? I'm confused here. Alephb (talk)\n\n@Alephb: Hello! No it hasn't been moved and I won't submit it until I get other opinions. I apparently wrote the link incorrectly--should not have included the 'talk'. It's there in my sandbox. I have not edited any on the original article because I was attempting to Be Bold! and do the whole rewrite suggested in the flag at the top!! I kept everything from the original article within the rewrite--I just relabeled and rearranged and added to it. I would like to change the Title. The Bible and violence is ambiguous; it could refer to using the Bible to address violence and help create peace--which is not what the article is about. Violence in the Bible is more specific and limited in scope. I would like to know if you think the rewrite in my sandbox has a neutral pov, if you think content needs altering in any way--oh just anything you feel like saying! I am genuinely grateful for any and all comments. Thank you up front! Jenhawk777 (talk)\n\nAlephb, the draft is at User:Jenhawk777/sandbox. Jenhawk has mostly been editing (in article-space) Christianity and violence, but you can see her at the The Bible and violence talkpage.

Alephb (talk)\n\n@Jenhawk777: I so far boldy made some improvements, but I acknowledge that this is a user space sandbox, and unlike mainspace or draft space, users can request that editors don't edit their personal sandboxes. I assume that you welcomed these edits starting this thread, but if not, feel free to say so. Thanks, —PaleoNeonate -\n\nI do welcome them! I do--this will be a true Wiki project before it evens gets sent up for approval! I am so relieved and grateful I could just about cry! I can't say thank you enough.Jenhawk777 (talk)\n\nThe truth is, I am not only genuinely grateful for what all of you have done to help me--genuinely help me--I am a little in awe of your knowledge and skills! This has been the best part of the whole Wiki experience as far as I'm concerned. You guys have really made a difference for me and I think if the article gets accepted, it will be your doing! A group effort--as it should be here--right? So edit away--do what you think is good--the only thing I have disagreed about so far was removing the section headings. Jenhawk777 (talk)\n\nAs an electronics systems design engineer, my own understanding of the \"light\" in Genesis 1:3 is as follows:\n\n1. Light is just one part of the entire electromagnetic spectrum, and when light was created then so were all the other forms- radio waves, heat, x-rays, cosmic rays, etc. [Wikipedia article on Electromagnetic Spectrum]\n\n2. Albert Einstein discovered that Energy and Matter are related by the square of the speed of light (E=Mc^2). [Wikipedia article on Mass Energy Equivalence] Thus, light had to be created before any matter or energy could be created.\n\nJkaness (talk)\n\nThat's fine, but views vary. Much depends on how literally one takes the Bible passage. Most Christians are not as scientifically literal as in your comment, and tend to be content with an interpretation that God did indeed create the universe without giving literal details (including scientific ones) as to how He created it. That approach looks more for the spiritual meaning and implications of God's creative act than for understanding the physical mechanisms. Evensteven (talk)\n\nI agree with your comments. I took the liberty of adding this point of view in a new subsection \"Physics\" under \"Interpretations\". That title seemed to me to offer differing viewpoints as opinions rather than hard referenced facts. I accept whatever Wikipedia wishes to do with it. PS, I cannot find how to write a superscript number (as in E=mc2)!Jkaness (talk)\n\nNote that unless you have a reliable source expressing this view about the Genesis story and physics, it would unfortunately be original research (WP:OR) if included in an article without such a source. Thanks, —PaleoNeonate –\n\nWikipedia has many thousands of wikilinks which point to disambiguation pages. It would be useful to readers if these links directed them to the specific pages of interest, rather than making them search through a list. Members of WikiProject Disambiguation have been working on this and the total number is now below 20,000 for the first time. Some of these links require specialist knowledge of the topics concerned and therefore it would be great if you could help in your area of expertise.\n\nA list of the relevant links on pages which fall within the remit of this wikiproject can be found at http://69.142.160.183/~dispenser/cgi-bin/topic_points.py?banner=WikiProject_Bible\n\nPlease take a few minutes to help make these more useful to our readers.— Rod talk\n\nOver at the Tribe of Issachar, there is a disagreement about the correct way to deal with disagreements between academia and religious authorities. In the interests of not getting myself into an edit war, I thought I would see if any project members would like to take a look and see what they think. Alephb (talk)\n\nAn editor has asked for a discussion to address the redirect Textual differences in the Bible. Please participate in the redirect discussion if you have not already done so. Hijiri 88 (聖やや)\n\nIf anyone wants to look in at Rephaite and evaluate what's going on there it might be useful. We've got one of those What is Wikipedia even for sorts of discussions starting. Alephb (talk)\n\nWe now have similar issues at Ishmael. Having uninvolved editors who are familiar the area of biblical scholarship look in might be helpful. Alephb (talk)\n\nI hope you understand that normally any request from you would take priority from me, and I did say I would have your back, and I did mean it, but the idea of getting involved in another controversy makes me queezy. This is my field of study but I just can't. Please forgive me. Jenhawk777 (talk)\n\nUser:Jenhawk777, I wouldn't think of asking you to. When I ask for other people to look into a conflict, it's best for me if they're not people I've had a lot of past interaction with. Otherwise it could take on the appearance of using personal connections to \"win\" conflicts. As it all shook out, the issue went to WP:ANI and resulted in a block by an administrator I'd never heard of, so it's no longer an active concern. Because of the role that consensus plays in settling Wiki-disputes, there's always the possibility that a group of editors would \"have each other's back\" and turn editing into a team sport, where a group of friends goes around beating up on other editors.\n\nThe best route for handling conflicts is trying to find uninvolved editors, which is why I would post to a third-party board like that rather than turning to my Wiki-buddies. I'm trying to avoid even the appearance of WP:CANVASSING. So there's nothing to forgive. I wouldn't want you running around to disagreements I'm involved in and taking my side. I'd be concerned if you did. It would make us look suspicious to the community. Alephb (talk)\n\nCanvassing! I can see how that would be bad the way they describe it! I get it. It actually makes me feel better about Wiki. There can be team sports as long as we are working together well on a common project, but when conflict arises, everyone has to take a step back in pursuit of the neutral consensus. We don't get neutrality from our friends--and we shouldn't--because of course I would run around taking your side! Always! And think it was right to do! But I can completely see it now--no canvassing! Okay then. One more unique characteristic of Wiki-world! Thank you! Jenhawk777 (talk)\n\nIt's possible that I personally am taking an overly strict approach to this no-canvassing thing. I think people probably draw these lines in different places. But I try to take a strict approach with myself. At the risk of blaspheming, we could compare to the proverbial fence around the Torah. If I can't convince uninvolved people who don't know me that they should take my side, I would hopefully take that as a sign that I'm either wrong or pursuing something too trivial to really be worth the time. Besides, I'm already tempted to argue more than is good for me. Knowing that I had someone who felt obliged to back me up would be altogether too much temptation. Alephb (talk)\n\nWhen it comes to canvassing, it's another example of an odd Wiki tendency: Often, the Wiki way is to simply take what an ordinary human being would do, and then avoid doing that. And, whenever I ramble about my high ideals, you should always take this as, This is how Alephb wishes he acted consistently, but probably is only how he operates on a good day.Alephb (talk)\n\nAnyone think maybe the time has come to start archiving this page? John Carter (talk) 23:24, 17 January 2018 (UTC) John Carter (talk)\n\nI think it might be about time. I wonder if there's a way to set it so that it leaves maybe six months worth of stuff or a year. Alephb (talk)\n\nThere were 4 archive pages already, but I've set up a bot to do the work from now on, leaving six months as suggested. – Fayenatic London\n\nOur article Moses includes a footnote that gives various ancient Semitic languages used variously by Jews and Christians starting with Hebrew, followed by Arabic, then Greek. I would have just moved the Greek before the Arabic myself but thought this might have come up before or I might be missing something.\n\nIs the Arabic only there because of Islam? I know there are (and have been forever) Arabic-speaking Jews and Christians, but the same is true of Spanish, and the only difference I can think of is Arabic's being the language of the Quran. But since Greek was the language of both the Christian New Testament and various (most?) Jewish Second Temple texts, and was also the primary language of the Jewish diaspora for a long time (unlike Arabic, which I'm pretty sure only gained widespread use after a fair few Jews had spread throughout Europe and would have been much more likely to speak Latin or a European vernacular than Arabic), it feels to me like it has more \"interfaith\" relevance than Arabic.\n\nAm I missing something?\n\nHijiri 88 (聖やや)\n\nI'd nitpick a bit about how many Jews ever spoke Greek, but I think you're basically right. I don't think you'll get any serious opposition if you move those around. I don't think the current order reflects any kind of deep thought or consensus -- notice how Syriac is currently ranked ahead of both Arabic and Greek. My impression across biblical articles in general is that transliterations are added in a pretty haphazard way. Sometimes they pile up into enormous piles that make the first sentence of an article all but unreadable. At least they're in a footnote in this case. Alephb (talk)\n\nThis article has been subject to recent edit warring. Additional eyes are welcome. John Carter (talk) 20:27, 27 January 2018 (UTC) John Carter (talk)\n\nThanks for the heads-up. I've tossed in my two cents -- not an overall solution, but a thought on one aspect of the problem, over at the talk page. Alephb (talk)\n\nI'm wondering if every single one of the titles listed at Lost work#Lost texts referenced in the Old Testament needs its own Wikipedia entry. Yes, Bible scholars have poured over every word of the Bible for centuries, so they have been name-dropped in thousands of sources, but that seems to be all she wrote (and all we can write) for most of them. Thoughts? Hijiri 88 (聖やや)\n\nThere are a lot of well written articles here. However, the author's should indicate who's bible they are using. I'm not saying one is better than the other, just that when I'm looking for information, such as genres of the books of the bible and I see that not all books are listed, I'm concerned. I understand that Martin Luther did not like (and removed) the books of Tobit, Judith, Wisdom, Ecclesiasticus, Baruch, First and Second Maccabees, as well as additions to Esther and Daniel; but they are part of biblical history. (https://catholicexchange.com/catholic-and-protestant-bibles-what-is-the-difference).\n\nPoint being, when citing a biblical reference, tell the reader if you are using a Catholic Bible or a non-Catholic Bible. — Preceding unsigned comment added by 192.108.183.4 (talk)\n\nNo, that's the difference between the pre-Reformation Christian Old Testament and the Jewish Bible and is less about Luther \"not liking\" certain books than them simply not being part of the Hebrew canon because they weren't in Hebrew. It's not simply \"Catholic vs. Protestant\"; there's also a Jewish bible. Hijiri 88 (聖やや)\n\nAttempting to indicate that there are only Catholic and Protestant Bibles seems to ignore that the Eastern Orthodox and multiple Oriental Orthodox churches have even more books than the Catholics and Protestants have, as per our article on the Biblical canon. Also, although I don't know this absolutely, I have reason to believe that at least some groups some might call \"Protestant\" include specific books not in the so-called Protestant Bible, making the use of at least that term more questionable. John Carter (talk)\n\nAre there any specific articles where the ambiguity has you worried, 192.108.183.4? Alephb (talk)\n\nI can see how it might be possible, probably even likely, that differing texts can lead to differing interpretations in some matters. One of Jack Myles' books I think indicated how the order of OT books leads to differing views' of when God became less active in human affairs. I know of at least two good reference works, broadly encyclopedic, about major Biblical interpreters and female Biblical interpreters. The texts of those works might be useful. When I finish what I'm doing now, I might try to add lists of their articles and references to project pages here. John Carter (talk)\n\nHello, WikiProject Bible.\n\nYesterday I created The Bible and humor. Someone placed an orphan-tag on it, so I started looking for good places to link it (I noted that there´s no Religious humour, Humour doesn´t mention religion and Religion doesn´t mention humour/humor).\n\nI looked at the Bible, and IMO \"The Bible and humor\" is to obscure for \"see also\" in that article, which brings me to the templates at the bottom of the article, where it obviously doesn´t fit either.\n\nSo my question is, would the Bible benefit from an additional template for \"Biblical topics\", such as Alcohol in the Bible, Ethics in the Bible, The Bible and slavery, The Bible and violence etc?

However, most Protestant Bibles exclude these passages as Biblical apocrypha, with the last two words linked in a manner that appears to (inadvertently?) emphasize the text's status as apocryphal for \"Protestant Bibles\" as opposed to the \"Church of England\". I'm pretty sure that, in reality, Anglican (Church of Ireland, Episcopalian, etc...) bibles include these as apocrypha where other Protestant bibles exclude them as apocrypha, but I'm not a specialist and so don't want to implement the change directly on he off-chance that either I'm wrong or I'm right but am missing some reason why my change would be bad. Hijiri 88 (聖やや)\n\nDo we have any conventionalized way of marking up (or removing, or whatever) the numbers in biblical material like:\n\n1 The LORD said to Moses, 2 \"Speak to the Israelites and say to them: 'I am the LORD your God. ... 4 You must obey my laws and be careful to follow my decrees. I am the LORD your God....\"\n\nThey're distracting and an impediment to reading, potentially even confusing. If we have a consensus to retain them, I'd like to at least minimize them in some way. But I don't want to just make up my own approach if there's something we're already doing (I wouldn't know; I almost never edit articles that require such quotes.) — SMcCandlish ☏ ¢ 😼\n\n@SMcCandlish: Policy (specifically NPOV) actually supports removing the numbers, since verse divisions differ between Jews and Christians and sometimes between different Christian denominations, even if some (including the ones you quote? not sure, but it doesn't really matter) happen to be universally accepted. Keeping the numbers gives the impression of promoting a particular religious group, and unlike the Wikipedia King James Only Movement (which is a legitimate concern about the copyright on more recent/accurate translations) I can't think of a valid argument for keeping them.

Ronhjones (Talk)\n\nHello, User:Ronhjones. I'm not seeing any discussion on the relevant talk page, that the link to a \"ticket\", if I click on it, leads to a disambiguation page. So I'm not sure where the original discussion is found, so here's my two cents here. Numbers 33:55 refers to some kinds of thorns or barbs in Israel \"sides\" or \"eyes\", and the Joshua reference is the same. Judges 2:3 may have a thorn, but it's not stuck in any particular body part. Similar things apply to the references in Ezekiel. I don't see any \"thorn in the flesh\" phrase in those references, and therefore no reason to doubt that the English phrase came in via the N.T.\n\nSo my inclination is to say the objection can basically be dismissed, but if you can get a working link up to the original conversation I might be able to help further. Alephb (talk)\n\n@Alephb: Sorry it's an OTRS e-mail, only OTRS agents can view them (and I mis-formatted the ticket number, doh!). They did not say much else. I'll tell them to comment here if they need more information. Ronhjones (Talk)\n\nAh, understood. I'd never heard of that OTRS business, and would be quite happy to stay out of other people's emails! I was only ever aware of an NT origin for the exact phrase, although the metaphor of something troublesome as a thorn sticking into a human body is older. If the person you're referring to wants to flesh that out in more depth in the article, I suppose I'd have no objection in principle, though the evil is in the details. The article is surprisingly well-sourced already for an article about a proverbial phrase, and I'd be very surprised if there's any reliable sources arguing that \"thorn in the flesh\" has a primary origin outside the New Testament. Let me know if there's any other way I can help. Alephb (talk)\n\nBelow is what I just posted at Wikipedia talk:WikiProject Christianity/Noticeboard.

Unfortunately, certain editors oppose the mainstream scholarly view of the Bible, and they will stonewall me if I try to do anything alone.

Has there been discussion of this? Johnbod (talk)\n\nJohnbod, we do use the numbers in Hebrew (Masoretic), and the King James Version, and Wikisource. We give the Septuagint/Vulgate also, but a psalm number on Wikipedia without saying which system is the former. It's always confusing because composers who set a Latin Psalm from the Vulgate used that number for their titles, of course, see In convertendo Dominus (Nuffel), Psalm 125 for the composer, but Psalm 126 here.\n\nThe question came up for images which seem not necessarily attached to the right psalm, - please check Psalm 10 and Psalm 11. --Gerda Arendt (talk)\n\nThat doesn't seem to agree with the articles around that stretch, although some are pretty short & vague, & could be on almost any psalm. But look at Psalm 10 for example, which clearly uses the Septuagint/Vulgate numbering, but says it is using the Masoretic. Johnbod (talk)\n\n″The flood narrative is made up of two stories woven together.[13] As a result many details are contradictory, such as how long the flood lasted (40 days according to Genesis 7:17, 150 according to 7:24), how many animals were to be taken aboard the ark (one pair of each in 6:19, one pair of the unclean animals and seven pairs of the clean in 7:2), and whether Noah released a raven which \"went to and fro until the waters were dried up\" or a dove which on the third occasion \"did not return to him again,\" or possibly both.[14] Despite this disagreement on details the story forms a unified whole (some scholars see in it a \"chiasm\", a literary structure in which the first item matches the last, the second the second-last, and so on),[b] and many efforts have been made to explain this unity, including attempts to identify which of the two sources was earlier and therefore influenced the other.[15][c]″\n\nThis passage is taken directly from the article on Genesis Flood Narrative https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genesis_flood_narrative\n\nIt seems that the author has not even read the passage when stating it to be contradictory to itself and hence a result of two stories \"woven together\". My reasoning is as follows:\n\nFirst of all, context requires that all the passage be looked at and not simply selective eisegesis.\n\n6 Noah was six hundred years old when the flood of waters came upon the earth. 11 In the six hundredth year of Noah's life, in the second month, on the seventeenth day of the month, on that day all the fountains of the great deep burst forth, and the windows of the heavens were opened.\n\nFrom this preliminary knowledge the Bible states the Flood began on the date 17/2/600. If we continue forward to the next verse it states:\n\n12 And rain fell upon the earth forty days and forty nights. 13 On the very same day Noah and his sons, Shem and Ham and Japheth, and Noah's wife and the three wives of his sons with them entered the ark,\n\nSo, again it repeats the entrance of Noah into the ark on the date 17/2/600. The length of the rain is 40 days, meaning it lasted 17/2/600 - 27/3/600.\n\n17 The flood continued forty days on the earth. The waters increased and bore up the ark, and it rose high above the earth. 18 The waters prevailed and increased greatly on the earth, and the ark floated on the face of the waters.\n\nThe waters are said to \"prevail\" upon the earth and increase, for 40 days. This clearly is restating the verse 12 40 days as the waters increase as the rain increases - a logical statement. Finally it says:\n\n24 And the waters prevailed on the earth 150 days.\n\nThis statement is given to sum the number of days the flood continued, a separate issue from the number of days the rain fell, causing the waters to prevail in the first place.\n\nThe dates continue in the next chapter, the eighth chapter of Genesis:\n\n3 and the waters receded from the earth continually. At the end of 150 days the waters had abated, 4 and in the seventh month, on the seventeenth day of the month, the ark came to rest on the mountains of Ararat.\n\nThe 150 days are stated once more and then equivocated with the date 17/7/600.\n\n5 And the waters continued to abate until the tenth month; in the tenth month, on the first day of the month, the tops of the mountains were seen.\n\nCurrently the dates stand: 17/2/600 - Ark Entered +40 days 27/3/600 - Rain ceases +110 days (150 - 40) 17/7/600 - The waters cease to prevail +73 days the waters abated 1/10/600 - The heads of the mountains were visible\n\nNo contradiction whatsoever.\n\nOf course the narrative continues to state times and days passed with the accuracy only desired of in historical narrative and not from an epic. There is no poetic pleasure to an audience who hears time and time again how many numbers of days between each event. I believe the current article to be in error with the bold assumptions made by its author and I hope this will be fixed, many thanks, Yasshur Yasshur (talk)\n\nI am currently involved in a dispute concerning newly created template Monarchy of Ancient Israel (see discussion), but as the discussion was progressing, it had me contemplating on the issues with older templates Kings of Israel and Kings of Judah. Both of these templates have created a common misconception of succession after Rehoboam's rule as the last king of the Kingdom of Israel (united monarchy). In the template concerning rulers of Judah, it seems that the rulers of Judah are continuing the reign of a United Kingdom of Israel (Saul, where's Ish-bosheth?, David, Solomon, and Rehoboam) Likewise, the rulers of the Northern Kingdom of Israel (should've been called \"Kingdom of Samaria\") do the same. In the template, it seems like Jeroboam is succeeding Rehoboam when Jeroboam was the first king of a Northern Kingdom of Israel (Samaria).\n\nOn the templates themselves, they are a clutter of links and take an unnecessary amount of space in a article. Not only that, they diminish the purpose of Template:Rulers of Ancient Israel. I'm not asking suggestions to improve these templates, I'm asking for consensus to remove them. There is no need for multiple navigational boxes, Template:Rulers of Ancient Israel is very-well organized/sufficient and already resolves all the issues. — JudeccaXIII (talk)\n\nAfter carefully considering the arguments above and checking the three templates involved , I could agree with a proposal to replace all instances of Template:Kings of Israel and Template:Kings of Judah with Template:Monarchy of Ancient IsraelTemplate:Rulers of Ancient Israel, and subsequently delete those first two templates. Debresser (talk)\n\nDebresser You don't think Template:Rulers of Ancient Israel is sufficient enough? I do apologize if I confused you or anyone else if I was asking to replace the two with Template:Monarchy of Ancient Israel. It's nice but it's quite large and defeats the whole purpose of Template:Rulers of Ancient Israel. JudeccaXIII (talk)\n\nThat's what I meant. Fixed that mistake now in the above post. Debresser (talk)\n\nReading all the comments, I support the removal of Template:Kings of Israel and Template:Kings of Judah, and the replacement with Template:Rulers of Ancient Israel. Very appreciate the works by JudeccaXIII and Debresser concerning this. Peace. JohnThorne (talk)\n\nHello and greetings from the maintainers of the WP 1.0 Bot!

Walkerma (talk)\n\nThe article Gospel could do with a little help. It currently contains some contentious claims that are stated as fact, and any attempt to change them being opposed. Some extra eyes would be welcome. DJ Clayworth (talk)\n\nCould you list here what these claims are?Achar Sva (talk)\n\nCurrently the main problems are that the \"content' section describes virtually nothing about the content of the Gospels, but instead focusses almost entirely on the discrepancies between the gospels. I believe both should be there. It also completely lacks any description of the significance of the Gospels to Christianity. A person could read this article and come away with absolutely no idea of what is in the Gospels, or why they are important to Christians. We should absolutely explain why the texts are important to Christians in an NPOV way. (There is also one person seriously arguing that all talk of the significance of the Gospels in Christian doctrine be disallowed.) DJ Clayworth (talk)\n\nSo to be clear: your concern is (a) to see more detail on the content of the gospels, and (b) something on their significance to Christians (or do you mean Christian doctrine -the first is contemporary and popular in focus, the second historical and theological)? Achar Sva (talk)\n\nBy long-standing practice and consensus, the entry upon the Bible, Quran and every other holy book has been added to Wikipedia:Reliable sources/Perennial sources. Tgeorgescu (talk)\n\nI noticed in many Biblical articles, there is an inconsistency in citing Bible references - sometimes linking to Wikisource and sometimes to the Bible Gateway website.

Just many more Americans are simply more familiar with the KJV when using the Bible. No other book has had quite an influence in the history of the world. So much so, that nearly every day one unintentionally references the KJV in normal conversation. Edding24 (talk)\n\nEdding24, Wikipedia's audience is larger than the United States. And Catholics - 20.8% of the US - are more familiar with translations like the NABRE and RSV-2CE. Elizium23 (talk)\n\nIt's Edding24 (talk · contribs). Their rationale seems to be \"I have edited the translation, not only because the King James Bible is more accurately translated and more beautifully written, but because Americans and English culture is simply more familiar and more accustomed to the style of the great King James Bible.\" - seems a bit like the KJ only movement. Is this ok? We can just go through and change to our favorite version? Doug Weller talk\n\nWhat is the rationale for picking any translation in a Wikipedia article?Edding24 (talk)\n\nProbably depends on the editor and the article. AFAIK there is no guideline or essay that speaks about Bible-translations. My approach would generally be in the spirit of WP:ENGVAR, meaning basically if you create the article (or is the one who starts adding Bible-texts) you can pick, possibly there's an argument that on a catholic topic it's reasonable to use a translation Catholics like if such exist, and in existing article's the current translation should in general be left alone since bickering about it takes time and annoys people (MOS:RETAIN), though it's probably a good idea to have consistency within the same article.

JohnThorne (talk)\n\n@John Thorne: thanks, but were they simply careless errors or vandalism? Doug Weller talk\n\n: @Doug Weller: From the monitoring so far, it seems to be a careless error. The user thought to use \"|\" to separate the first and last verses, not knowing that the number after the separator actually points to \"different Bible versions or translations\". The numbers themselves are accurately meant for the last verse in the citation. JohnThorne (talk)\n\n@JohnThorne: that makes sense, thanks. Doug Weller talk\n\nIs there some form of consensus on how Psalms with different numberings due to variants between the Vulgate/Hebrew numbering schemes should be given in article text?

For instance, \"Song of Solomon\" was being used instead of \"Song of Songs\" and \"Lamentations of Jeremiah\" was being used instead of \"Lamentations\". No Jew (from my experience) has ever used these terms. I looked a bit deeper into it, and the term \"Song of Solomon\" is uncommon in Judaism because it is not a Jewish phrase. Any thoughts?

A recent Village pump proposal was approved and has been implemented to add a |class= parameter to {{WikiProject banner shell}}, which can display a general quality assessment for an article, and to let project banner templates \"inherit\" this assessment.\n\nNo action is required if your wikiproject follows the standard assessment approach. Over time, quality assessments will be migrated up to {{WikiProject banner shell}}, and your project banner will automatically \"inherit\" any changes to the general assessments for the purpose of assigning categories.\n\nHowever, if your project has decided to \"opt out\" and follow a non-standard quality assessment approach, all you have to do is modify your wikiproject banner template to pass {{WPBannerMeta}} a new |QUALITY_CRITERIA=custom parameter. If this is done, changes to the general quality assessment will be ignored, and your project-level assessment will be displayed and used to create categories, as at present.
