Tunc dicent inter gentes: Magnificavit Dominus facere cum eis.\n\nMagnificavit Dominus facere nobiscum; facti sumus laetantes.\n\nConverte, Domine, captivitatem nostram, sicut torrens in austro.\n\nQui seminant in lacrimis, in exsultatione metent.\n\nEuntes ibant et flebant, mittentes semina sua. Venientes autem venient cum exsultatione, portantes manipulos suos.\n\n----------------\n\nWhen the Lord brought back the captivity of Sion, we became like men comforted.\n\nThen was our mouth filled with gladness; and our tongue with joy. Then shall they say among the Gentiles: The Lord hath done great things for them.\n\nThe Lord hath done great things for us: we are become joyful.\n\nTurn again our captivity, O Lord, as a stream in the south.\n\nThey that sow in tears shall reap in joy.\n\nGoing they went and wept, casting their seeds.\n\nBut coming they shall come with joyfulness, carrying their sheaves."
