Having labored for ten years on this book, I now understand why. For years, my students have urged me to write this book, but I demurred due to a mixture of doubt, fear, and common sense. At some point in one’s career, however, the urge arises to make some definitive statement of one’s accomplishment as a hedge against mortality. The coincidence of these two forces is the catalyst for this book, which represents the content of courses on the history of choral literature taught to hundreds of upper-level undergraduate and graduate students during my tenure at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign (1982 to 2011). I must admit that even contemplating writing a book that purports to survey the immense body of choral music in the Western world requires a certain degree of hubris. Had I not had the experiences of trying to codify the bare bones of this subject to respond to students’ questions about and critiques about these works, I would never have contemplated, much less completed, the task. That I did so is a testament to the students with whom I have been so fortunate to work in both academic and performance venues. I routinely tell each new generation of graduate students that while I understand that they expect me to give them the “answers,” my job is to teach them to ask the right questions, to which they, like me, will find their own answers. I also seek to encourage them by pointing out that the breadth of my knowledge was not gained from any single class or teacher but as part of an ongoing fascination with choral music in all its diversity, the various factors that shape how any given composer exercises his art, and the continual challenge of effecting a synthesis between academic knowledge and performance. The classes were always multisemester units— two for the master’s of music survey and four for the doctor of musical arts seminar (one class devoted to each of the four major historical periods). One advantage of teaching these classes was that my students were very forgiving of the inevitable omissions. Rather, the emphasis was on covering representative composers and genres to establish paradigms that would serve these students throughout their careers. While these classes never came close to covering all of the music assayed in these volumes, I felt that putting the content of these classes into writing afforded no such luxury; I am constantly, often painfully, aware of how much is left unsaid, despite the genuine desire to be as thorough as possible. Aware of these necessary omissions, I apologize in advance to those readers who find that one of their favorite composers or pieces has been overlooked. In my classes, such gaps were routinely filled by individual research projects, and I expect the same result to ensue here. The following list might serve as the necessary foundation for understanding my process in the two volumes into which this history of choral music has morphed: 1. Choral music, by its very nature, depends on and derives from text. Like the art of choral performance, my goal has been to reconstruct the composer’s process, to understand how words have inspired their choices regarding form, harmony, texture, and melody. 2. Another essential part of the process involves the art of analysis, that is, understanding by whatever means available why composers made the choices they ix\n\nx\n\nPreface did and how their process must inform ours as conductors. To that end, the array of analytical techniques proffered within will serve as examples of how to approach the music of any given era, acknowledging the reality that no single approach will likely be the sole explanation for how music works. 3. Like any type of history, the study of choral music requires due consideration of various contexts—political, religious, cultural, philosophical, aesthetic, technological—that have shaped each artwork into a unique creation.\n\nThis volume begins with a necessary survey of those aspects of medieval music that have continued to affect choral music even to this day—the concepts of liturgy and modality. The Renaissance takes up the next four chapters, which cover the growth of sacred music up to Josquin (chap. 2), the rise of secular music (chap. 3), sacred polyphony from Josquin to Palestrina and his contemporaries (chap. 4), and the sacred and secular choral repertory unique to England (chap. 5). The Baroque era is dealt with primarily according to geography, starting, as did the period itself, with Italy (chap. 6), spreading to Germany (chap. 7), France (chap. 8), and ultimately England (chap. 9), which combines the eras of Purcell and Handel in recognition of the latter composer’s manifold indebtedness to the former. Then I devote an entire chapter to the music of J. S. Bach (chap. 10). Given the rather awkward overlap between the deaths of Bach and Handel and the beginnings of what would become Classical music, the next four chapters examine the aesthetic foundations of both Classical and Romantic music (chap. 11) and then proceed to explore the major choral genres common to both periods—Mass (chap. 12), Requiem (chap. 13), and, finally, smaller sacred works both Protestant and Catholic (chap. 14). The historical narrative resumes in volume 2, examining other nineteenth-century genres (oratorio, part song, dramatic music, and choral symphony) before tackling the incredibly diverse content of the contemporary period. Finally, I would exhort anyone who reads this book (and its companion volume) to remember that this information began as musings about and analysis of actual music. It must be read with that fact in mind and, hopefully, with ready access to the many scores that were the starting point for my own scholarly journey. This is not an attempt to provide students with pithy, quotable statements to use in papers but with a wide range of approaches to understanding the scores that we, as conductors, deal with on a daily basis. Chester L. Alwes Mahomet, IL May 2014\n\nAcknowledgments Any proper list of acknowledgments must begin with one’s teachers. I am indebted to the many musicians and scholars who have exercised such a profound and generous influence on me, whether direct or indirect, acknowledged or unknown. This list would have to include my primary mentors—Richard Spalding, J. David Wagner, Richard French, Gerhard Herz, Richard Gore, Harold J. Decker, Leonard Rumery, Herbert Kellman, Nicholas Temperley, Alexander Ringer, and Tom Ward. Among my mentors none has had a more lasting influence than my dear friend Arnold Epley, who has nurtured and assisted my musical development from my teenage years to the present. Finally, there are the many friends and colleagues both near (Katharine Syer, Steven Taylor, Tom Ward, and Stephen Zank) and far (Bill Brooks, Pamela Elrod, Xiantang Hong, and John Leman) who have generously read and offered invaluable insights into many of the book’s chapters. I am obviously grateful to my alma mater and employer, the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign for providing me with a world-class education, access to stimulating colleagues and students, an incredibly rich body of resources for research, teaching, and performance opportunities and financial support (in the form of a research assistant) that made the completion of this book possible. One glance at the bibliography will reveal the important role that dissertations written at Illinois have played not only in my research but also in the work of scholars throughout the world. As I prepared this manuscript for publication, I realized once again of the immense riches contained in the libraries of the University of Illinois and the ease of access that they so graciously provide. I am indebted to the staff of the music library and the Performing Arts library: John Wagstaff, head bibrarian (who also read some of the chapters), Marlys Scarbrough, Kirsten Dougan, William Buss, Chris Pawlicki, and others. They have accepted my presence in their work space with grace, essentially granting me unfettered access to this invaluable resource. I am indebted to Suzanne Ryan, Norman Hirschy, Madelyn Sutton, Caelyn Cobb, and Adam Cohen of Oxford University Press for believing in this project and being supportive of my efforts, even when I wrote too much and took too long. All have been unfailingly gracious, answering the many questions that any first-time author needs answered. I would also like to acknowledge with gratitude and respect the initial editing of this massive manuscript by David Pear; not only did he treat the text with care and respect but was also quick to offer many appreciated suggestions for photos to break up the otherwise barren expanse of text and even citations for articles, which proved most enlightening. For the wonderful images that realized Mr. Pear’s ideas, I am indebted to Toby Greenberg, who meticulously researched a treasure trove of possible images and secured all the necessary licenses. Her assistance has gone far beyond that of one employed to do a job; indeed, she has been a source of encouragement, invaluable advice, and a model of professionalism. Finally, I am indebted beyond words to my copy editor, Mary Sutherland, who more than any other single person helped bring this book to print. A fellow Louisvillian (what a small world it is!), Mary has become a trusted friend and constant source of helpful advice. Although we have not yet met face to face, we have shared so much in this process that I cannot imagine having anyone else as my editor. I am likewise grateful to the many publishers of both music and books who have generously allowed me to use their publications to enrich this book. I have taken pains to xi\n\nxii\n\nAcknowledgments\n\nacknowledge their assistance wherever possible but would specifically acknowledge the generosity of Fehrmann Gennica (Finland), Stainer and Bell (London), Faber Music (London), Musica Russica, Belmont Music (United States), and the Stockhausen Foundation, all of which have allowed me to use materials they own at no charge. Finally, there is a small group of people without whom this project could never have been successfully completed. To Wes Alexander, I am indebted for his patience and hard work assisting me in the preparation of the many musical examples that elucidate aspects of musical style. I would not have been able to complete the finished manuscript without the careful and patient editing of these examples by Derryl Singley, whose keen eye for detail and knowledge of how publishers operate were of inestimable value. I am grateful to Nelly Matova, who, for two years, worked as my research assistant; her unflinching and meticulous attention to detail have assured that the bibliography, notes, tables, and index are as accurate as possible. I also want to thank my son Jonathan, whose expertise in computer science at the University of Illinois-Springfield came to the rescue of his technologically challenged father on many occasions. Finally, I must acknowledge the many contributions to literally every aspect of this project made by my wife, Marlys Scarbrough, whose brilliance as a music librarian and Internet guru are surpassed only by her unwavering emotional support and belief that I could actually finish this book.\n\nAbbreviations m./mm. measure/measures MM metronome marks BM Baroque Music BWV Bach-Werke-Verzeichnis CM Choral Music: A Norton Historical Anthology CMM Corpus Mensurabilis Musicae CRM Classic and Romantic Music: A Comprehensive Survey (Blume, ed.)

Although polyphonic vocal music existed as early as the eleventh century, choral music (understood as the performance of polyphony by multiple singers on each part) first flowered in the Renaissance (ca. early fifteenth century–late sixteenth century). To understand the Masses and motets of the fifteenth century requires an awareness of the history and liturgy of preceding centuries. Our historical survey of Western choral music thus begins with an exploration of liturgical and theoretical bases. The earliest Roman Catholic liturgical music was monophonic, generically known as plainsong or chant. The latter term often carries the qualifier “Gregorian,” honoring Pope Gregory I (r. 590–604), even though the oldest extant manuscript sources postdated his papacy by some three centuries. The existence of these chant manuscripts harks back to Charlemagne’s decision to embrace Christianity. To accomplish his goal, he acquired Roman liturgical books, which commingled with the extant body of Frankish music known as Gallican chant. The resulting repertory, copied in the early ninth century, often included the introductory text Gregorius praesul as a way of currying favor with Rome and establishing the new faith’s bona fides.2 1\n\n2\n\nA History of Western Choral Music\n\nAs liturgical monody grew in size, complexity, and diversity of function, its preservation increasingly relied on developing a standardized pitch notation. Simple shapes reminded singers of a given chant’s melodic contour, but as polyphony grew more sophisticated, increasingly precise notations of pitch and rhythm were needed. Any discussion of early Renaissance choral polyphony requires an understanding of such terminology as trope, ligature, neume, and mensural notation. Since medieval polyphony was inextricably tied to chant (via the use of Gregorian cantus firmi), we must understand the liturgy that summoned this music into existence; this includes the system of calendric organization that governed the performance of that music. The medieval mind was fascinated with number and organization, a tendency reflected in the organization of worship, especially in monastic settings where the daily routine included a full regimen of services. Liturgical organization operated on both macrocosmic (the liturgical year) and microcosmic (the liturgical day) levels. Table 1.1 The Liturgical Year\n\nThe Pre-Christmas Season Advent I—IV (The four Sundays preceding Christmas) A penitential season during which the Gloria of the Mass was deleted The Christmas Season—Christmas (12/25) to Epiphany (1/6) Christmas Day (12/25) Feast of Saint Stephen (12/26) Feast of Saint John (12/27) Sunday within the Octave of Christmas Feast of the Circumcision (1/1) Conversion of Paul (1/2) Epiphany—the celebration of the arrival of the Wise Men Feast of the Epiphany (1/6) The Sundays after Epiphany (variable in number from two to eight) Feast of the Purification/Presentation (2/2) Pre-Lent—formerly the three Sundays (Septuagesima, Sexagesima, and Quinquagesima) prior to Ash Wednesday The Latin titles of these three Sundays (no longer celebrated) were Latin ordinals indicating seventy, sixty, and fifty days before Easter; though not arithmetically accurate, the titles followed the Latin designation of Lent proper as Quadrigesima (forty days). Lent—the six Sundays prior to Easter Ash Wednesday—The penitential season of Lent begins with the imposition of ashes to signify repentance. The forty days of Lent represent the forty days Jesus spent fasting in the desert, his temptation by Satan and, metaphorically, the forty years that the Israelites wandered in the desert after the Exodus from Egypt. Historically, the five Sundays prior to Palm Sunday were assigned names based on the incipit of their Latin Introits: Invocabit Laetare Oculi Reminiscere Judica Palmarum Maundy Thursday\n\nWestern Choral Music—Medieval Foundations\n\n3\n\nTable 1.1 Continued\n\nGood Friday Holy Saturday Easter—Paschal Time Easter is the first Sunday following the first full moon after the vernal equinox. The date of Easter is not fixed (as Christmas is) but fluctuates between March 23 and April 22. Precisely where it falls in the calendar determines both the number of Sundays in Epiphany and after Pentecost. Easter Sunday Easter Monday Easter Tuesday Quasimodogeniti Misericordias Domini Jubilate Cantate Rogate The Latin names of the Sundays in Paschal Time derive from the opening word of the de tempore Introit. Pentecost\n\nDepending on the date of Easter (a moveable feast, first codified by the Venerable Bede, ca. 673–735), the season of Pentecost consists of from twenty-two to twenty-eight Sundays. The Feast of the Ascension falls on the Thursday thirteen days prior to Pentecost. Pentecost (fifty days after Easter) marks the descent of the Holy Spirit as mentioned in the Gospels. Like Christmas and Easter, Pentecost is celebrated liturgically for three days (Sunday, Monday, and Tuesday).3 Following the Council of Nicaea in 325, the Feast of the Holy Trinity was added to the liturgical calendar as the Sunday following Pentecost. The remaining Sundays of the liturgical year are now referred to as Sundays after Pentecost or Sundays after Trinity. Monasteries organized themselves around a series of daily services corporately known as the “Offices” or “Hours.” These comprised two levels—the “Greater Hours” and the “Lesser Hours”: Table 1.2 The Liturgical Day\n\nGreater Hours\n\nLesser Hours\n\nMatins (3 a.m.) Lauds (6 a.m.)\n\nPrime (6 a.m.) Terce (9 a.m.) Sext (12 noon) None (3 p.m.)\n\nVespers (ca. 6 p.m.) Compline (ca. 9 p.m.)\n\n4\n\nA History of Western Choral Music Table 1.3 Greater Hours—Canticles\n\nService\n\nCanticle\n\nMatins Lauds\n\nJubilate Deo or Te Deum Benedictus Dominus Deus Israel\n\nVespers\n\nCanticle of Zachariah—Lk 1:68–79 Magnificat\n\nCompline\n\nCanticle of B.V.M.—Lk 1:46–55 Nunc Dimittis Canticle of Simeon—Lk 2:29–32\n\nThe Greater Hours required the entire community’s attendance; since the Lesser Hours were not obligatory they tended to be simpler and therefore less musically significant. The musical centerpiece of the Greater Hours was the canticle proper to each service. The familiarity of the Magnificat canticle (or “Song of Mary” [Lk 1:46–55]) resulted from the designation of Vespers as the only liturgical Office to allow polyphonic music. Accordingly, the choral repertory includes numerous settings of this text, including cycles of settings in each of the eight modes (e.g., the cycles by Leonhard Lechner, Cristobal de Morales, and others). Such settings typically featured the alternation of chant (for the odd-numbered verses) and polyphony (for the even-numbered verses), a technique known as “Alternatimpraxis.” Compositional interest in this particular Office eventually extended beyond the canticle to include settings of the entire service: Structure of Vespers:\n\n5 psalms (taken from psalms 110–1474) with their antiphons Hymn Magnificat\n\nThe Mass The principal liturgical ritual is the Mass, which has two levels both liturgically and musically. The first level introduces one of the most important concepts in liturgy, the complementary notions of “Proper” and “Ordinary.” The Proper of the Mass reflects the church’s seasons and celebrations, and it changes accordingly; the Ordinary is exactly that: it remains the same for any Mass regardless of season or degree of solemnity. The second layer of the Mass’s musical organization categorizes music either as chanted/intoned by a priest or sung, either by the soloist or ensemble. Polyphonic settings of the sung Ordinary texts (Kyrie, Gloria, Credo, Sanctus/ Benedictus, and Agnus Dei) of the Mass are directly tied to the emergence of polyphonic Mass cycles in the Renaissance. Composers initially applied polyphony to the Propers of the Mass because these chants featured soloists, and it was the solo portions of a chant that received polyphonic treatment. Responsorial chants, such as Benedicamus Domino (ex. 1.1), appeared most frequently as the tenor (see n. 13), the essential foundation of any polyphonic structure.\n\nWestern Choral Music—Medieval Foundations\n\n5\n\nTable 1.4 The Roman Mass\n\nIntoned Proper\n\nOrdinary\n\nChanted Proper\n\nOrdinary\n\n1.

The total range (ambitus) of this chant is A to A.5 There are two separate parts: the verse Benedicamus Domino, and the Respond (or Responsory) Deo gratias, both of which have same pitch content. The ambitus of the chant (A–A) and prominent role of the final on D confirm a Hypodorian modal profile.\n\nModality Modality facilitated the classification of different chant melodies. Initially, these chants adhered to one of four profiles, each based on a shared final and two different ranges. We now call these modes (adopted ca. the fifth century) the “authentic” modes; in the sixth century, an additional four (called “plagal”) were added. While retaining the same final as their respective predecessors, each had different reciting tones and ranges.\n\n6\n\nA History of Western Choral Music Table 1.5 Modes\n\nMode 1. 2. 3. 4. 5. 6. 7. 8.\n\nDorian Hypodorian Phrygian Hypophrygian Lydian Hypolydian Mixolydian Hypomixolydian\n\nFinal\n\nReciting Tone\n\nRange\n\nD D E E F F G G\n\nA F C A C A D C\n\nD–D′ A–A E–E′ A–A F–F′ C–C′ G–G′ D–D′\n\nThe presence of only four finals confirms the eight scales as four pairs that share a common final but are otherwise different. In treatises these pairs were frequently given generic numerical names—Protus, Deuterus, Tritus, and Tetrardus. While the final of modes 1 and 2 (Dorian and Hypodorian) was D, chants in each mode had different ranges: Dorian using D–D′ and Hypodorian A–A. The lower range of mode 2 reminds us that the original performers of this music were male. The range of mode 2 was a fourth below that of mode 1, leading to its designation as “plagal” (the subdominant, IV).6 Conversely, mode 1 was “authentic” because its range encompassed the octave above the final. This complementary relationship applied to all four modal pairs. Each mode (ex. 1.2) had its own “reciting tone,” which was generally the fifth scale-degree of the authentic octave, a third lower in the plagal mode. Example 1.2 Modal Profiles\n\nThe two deviations from this model both occurred to avoid the pitch on B. For example, the reciting tone of Phrygian mode (on E) should be B, but this pitch’s difficult association with tritones, (e.g., F–B, an augmented 4th, not only hard to sing but impossible to tune correctly) caused a relocation of its reciting tone to C′ (mode 3) and A (mode 4). Similarly, in Hypomixolydian mode, the final would have fallen on B, requiring its movement to C′.\n\nWestern Choral Music—Medieval Foundations\n\n7\n\nThe range of Benedicamus Domino is A–A, but its final is D. There are no reciting tones in this chant but the melodic prominence of F confirms the chant’s modality as Hypodorian. Although the melodies of the solo polyphony and the choral response (Deo gratias) are the same, untrained singers needed a process whereby they could decipher and remember their pitches. Guido d’Arezzo (ca. 991/992–ca. 1033) devised a system of three overlapping hexachords to identify each individual pitch. The entire range of possible notes was arranged as a scale of overlapping hexachords (ex. 1.3) because it began on G (written as the Greek letter Γ or gamma, which was the first and lowest possible ut, hence gamma ut, which became the word “gamut,” signifying the whole range): Example 1.3 Guido’s Gamut Solmized\n\nEach specific pitch designation consists of the pitch name and the solmization syllable/s associated with it; a note used in two hexachords uses both solmization syllables, the first being the lower position. Thus, the first C in e­ xample 1.3 is called C fa-ut because it first occurs as fa in the G hexachord. Each hexachord has the same diatonic pitch collection but receives a different name: the hexachord beginning on C is called “natural;” the other two both contain the pitch B, their names reflecting how they use it. The hexachord on F is called “soft” (Hexachordum mollum) because its fourth scale degree must be B♭ (hence fa), while in the G hexachord B appears as the third scale degree (mi) requiring B♮ and earning the designation “hard” (Hexachordum durum).7 To read Benedicamus Domino, singers took the starting pitch given by the cantor as sol because the first series of pitches fit within the G hexachord. For that reason, Benedicamus Domino lacks a signed B♭. Using this hexachord the singers could read the melody as far as the first syllable of Domino. The appearance of F, a note not available in the G hexachord, requires the singers to change hexachords in order to continue, a process called “mutation.” The only mutation possible is to the C hexachord, which accommodates all of the pitches save the last. Example 1.4 re-creates a likely solmization of the Benedicamus Domino melody. Example 1.4 Benedicamus Domino Solmized\n\nAnother variable of modality was transposition. The most common transposition was up a fourth, indicated by a signed B♭. Thus, any composition (monophonic or polyphonic) with a G final and a signed B♭ had to be some form of Dorian mode transposed to G; to decide which (mode 1 or\n\n8\n\nA History of Western Choral Music\n\nmode 2) required assessing the range and reciting tone, which are, like the final, transposed. Thus, any composer writing a Dorian melody had four possible permutations from which to choose: 1. Dorian on D\n\nD\n\nD–D′\n\nA\n\nno signed B♭\n\n2. Hypodorian on D\n\nD\n\nA–A\n\nF\n\nno signed B♭\n\n3. Dorian on G\n\nG\n\nG–G′\n\nD\n\nsigned B♭\n\n4. Hypodorian on G\n\nG\n\nD–D′\n\nB♭\n\nsigned B♭\n\nDorian on D and Hypodorian on G have the same range, while G Dorian and D Hypodorian are quite similar.\n\nModality in Polyphonic Music In 1547, the Swiss theorist Glareanus published a treatise titled Dodekachordon (“12 tones”), in which he proposed expanding the eight-mode system to a twelve-mode system by adding Aeolian mode (i.e., natural minor on A) and Ionian mode (“major” on C). These new modes operated in precisely the same fashion as the first eight, each having its common final, separate range, and reciting tone, and the like. His advocacy of these two new modes resulted in a general realignment of the twelve modes into two constellations—one that emulates the “major” modality (Ionian, Lydian, and Mixolydian), and one that favors the “minor” modality (Aeolian, Dorian, and, to a lesser extent, Phrygian). As polyphonic compositions became normative, the modal system needed to apply to multiple voices. Therefore, the four standard voices (soprano, alto, tenor, and bass) were arranged as pairs (soprano-tenor and alto-bass) with comparable ranges. Current scholarship has referred to these pairs as “conterminous” because the highest note of the lower voice is identical with the lowest note of the upper voice. This pairing (ex. 1.5) also took advantage of the existence of the two modal octaves (authentic and plagal), assigning one vocal pair to each. Example 1.5 Conterminous Modal Pairs\n\nThe melodic relatedness of the two related forms of the mode and the desire of printers to avoid ledger lines produced another marker of modal identity, the use of distinctive clefs. The ranges of the conterminous vocal pairs for mode 1 (on D) allowed the use of “low clefs” (C1, C3, C4, F4), the “authentic” octave (D–D′) forming the range of the soprano and tenor, and the “plagal” (A–A′) that\n\nWestern Choral Music—Medieval Foundations\n\n9\n\nof the alto and bass.8 Mode 2 reversed these ranges (S/T: G–G; A/B: D–D), necessitating the use of a different set of clefs for the soprano/tenor pair; these are typically called “high clefs” or chiavette (G, C2, C3, and F3 or C4).9 Transposition of Dorian mode to G (ex. 1.6) reversed the positions of these vocal ranges and the clefs them—mode 1, the soprano/tenor pair now had the range G–G, requiring “high clefs,” while the shift of range in mode 2 allowed “low clefs” (D–D). Example 1.6 Clefs for Dorian (modes 1 and 2) on d and g\n\nThe final aspect of modal identity, unique to polyphonic music, was the creation of a hierarchy of cadential pitches. In the parlance of modal counterpoint, a cadence involved two voices proceeding in stepwise motion from an imperfect consonance to a perfect consonance (ex. 1.7). A perfect cadence is one in which the soprano and tenor move by stepwise motion to the final of the mode.10 The ascending voice (half step) is called “sopranizans,” regardless of which voice part it occurs in; similarly, the descending voice (whole step) is called “tenorizans.” In the Renaissance the advent of a voice part beneath the tenor provided a new harmonic feature; the only possible consonance beneath a modal cadence was the fifth below the descending voice, the presence of which created what we now call the V–I cadence. The third cadence in ­example 1.7 illustrates what Heinrich Besseler calls the “octave leap” cadence (Oktavsprungsprungkadenz).11 Here, the bass part harmonizes the first note of the cadence with the dominant but leaps an octave to avoid having all three voices arrive at the cadential pitch. Other characteristics further qualified the perfect cadence—a 4–3 suspension in the soprano, dominant–tonic (V–I) motion in the bass, and the participation of the entire vocal texture. Any departure from this ideal cadence created cadences that had less value as markers of formal structure. By charting the modal cadences of a composition—the pitches to which cadences are made, the voices involved, the total number of voices sounding, the presence or absence of suspension, and V–I motion in the bass—the relationship between cadential quality and formal structure became more varied, allowing for greater subtlety in the unfolding musical form.\n\n10\n\nA History of Western Choral Music Example 1.7 Mode V, Modal Cadences\n\nThe increasing importance of contrapuntal modal cadences also guided the application of musica ficta (i.e., sharpening or flattening of certain notes; the significance of the pitch involved in the overall modal scheme often determined the propriety of applying ficta). In Dorian mode on D, for example, a cadence to the modal final (D) was possible only by changing the diatonic C to C♯. A direct correlation developed between the need to create a cadence and the syntax (punctuation) of the text, the strongest cadences being reserved to demarcate major textual divisions.\n\nThe Origins of Polyphony The oldest surviving sources of polyphony date from the same period as Gregorian chant— the late ninth century. Two treatises—Musica enchiriadis and Scholia enchiriadis—contain the first theoretical examples of this new art. From the outset, polyphony was dependent on the chant in an almost parasitical way, strict organum being nothing more than the simultaneous presentation of the chant melody at one of the perfect consonances—octave, fifth, fourth, and compounds. Example 1.8 shows how a portion of Benedicamus Domino might be performed as simple organum. The chant (ex. 1-8a), sung by the lowest voice (vox principalis) and decorated by the higher voice (vox organalis), mirrored its contours at the fifth (ex. 1-8b), fourth (ex. 1-8c) and, finally, doubled at the octave to produce compound organum. Strict organum is not actually polyphony in the modern sense of the term since the two vocal lines merely mirror one another.12 Fairly quickly, organa that introduced greater textural and harmonic variety began to appear; Guido d’Arezzo’s treatise Micrologus (ca. 1040), the first significant treatment of polyphony since Musica enchiriadis, was an early source of this more advanced organum. The next stage of development was the repertory of melismatic organum (ex. 1.9) associated with pilgrimage churches like St. Martial de Limoges and Santiago de Compostella. The organal voice decorates the chant by overlaying it with melismas (a group of notes sung to one syllable), increasing the duration of each pitch of the chant melody. Modern attempts to perform such music quickly reveal a problem—there is no rhythm to assist the singers in aligning their parts or anticipating the principal (chant) voice’s movement to a new pitch. The increasing length of the melisma above any chant pitch made aural identification of the chant melody increasingly difficult. The lower, chant-bearing voice therefore became called the “tenor” as it “held” the principal melody.13 The flats above some of the B’s in the example represent the possible application of musica ficta either to eliminate harmonic tritones or to implement the\n\nWestern Choral Music—Medieval Foundations\n\n11\n\nsolmization rule “una nota super la, semper est canendem fa.” (One note above la [A in the C hexachord] is always sung as fa [B♭].) Example 1.8 Strict Organum\n\nExample 1.9 Melismatic Organum\n\nPrior to the mid-twelfth century, polyphony was largely a provincial art. By that time Paris had already attained a status as the principal educational center of medieval Europe. The University of Paris boasted such intellectual luminaries as Peter Abelard, Bernard of Clairvaux, and Peter Lombard. What we now call France was a comparatively stable area politically under the reigns of Louis VI and VII. The cathedral of Notre Dame rapidly became one of the leading churches in Christendom outside of Rome; it is no surprise then that a school of composers\n\n12\n\nA History of Western Choral Music\n\ndestined to create the next compositional watershed in the history of polyphonic music flourished there. The main innovation of the Notre Dame School was the introduction of “modal rhythm” as a solution to the problems posed by melismatic organum. Various rhythmic modes were adopted from Latin and French verse and translated into mensural units based on the alternation of longs and shorts in a ratio of 2:1 (the sum representing the Trinity and thus perfection in the medieval mind-set). Each of these modes was identified by its own specific pattern of ligatures and rhythmic combinations:14\n\n1. 2. 3. 4. 5. 6.\n\nTrochaic Iambic Dactylic Anapestic Spondeic Tribrachic\n\nLong-Breve-Long-Breve Breve-Long-Breve-Long Long-Breve-Breve Breve-Breve-Long Long-Long Breve-Breve-Breve-Breve-Breve-Breve\n\nIn modes 1 and 2, both long and breve were read as imperfect (i.e., duple) creating the pattern half note–quarter note; half note–quarter note (reversed for 2) in modern transcription. In modes 3 and 4 the longs were perfect (dotted half note), and the two breves were unequal, the second being longer than the first (i.e., quarter note–half note). In mode 5, both longs were perfect (2 dotted half notes), while in mode 6 all the breves were imperfect (six quarter notes). The compositional process involved in creating organum of the Notre Dame type can be summarized as: 1. A Proper chant was selected. 2. The solo portions of the chant were set polyphonically, the choral sections sung in unison. 3. The polyphonic sections assumed one of two textures—melismatic organum or discantus. 4. Pieces normally began with melismatic organum, the duplum15 almost always using rhythmic mode 1. Wherever the original chant contained a melisma sung by a soloist, composers applied discantus (note-against-note) texture to the upper voice(s) and modal rhythm (usually mode 5) to the tenor. The resulting synchronous texture was therefore called discantus. This description typifies the music of the first named composer of polyphony— Magister Leoninus. The sole surviving description of Leonin’s music appears in a treatise written by an unknown thirteenth-century English scribe (Anonymous IV, a name that may apply to either the author or the manuscript or both) studying in Paris. Of Leonin, he writes: And note that Magister Leoninus, so it has been said, was the best worker with organum [optimus organista], who made [fecit] the great book of polyphony [magnus liber organi] on the gradual and antiphonary to embellish the divine service.16\n\nWestern Choral Music—Medieval Foundations\n\n13\n\nRecent scholarship has identified Leonin as a member of the Notre Dame Cathedral staff in the second half of the twelfth century. By 1192 he is referred to in cathedral documents as “magister Leonius presbyter,” indicating that in addition to his musical duties, he was also a priest.17 While there is general consensus that the Magnus Liber Organi was at least initiated by Leonin, doubt exists as to exactly how much of its music Leonin actually composed and when. Nonetheless, the book is a musical milestone—the first publication of polyphonic settings of the Proper chants of the Mass and Office for the entire liturgical year. There is agreement that Leonin’s music consists primarily of two-part organum, in which both melismatic and discant styles appear (ex. 1.10). Leonin begins with melismatic organum, the duplum cast in mode 1. The duplum has a melodic curve shaped, in some cases, by sequence. The melody is also contrived to make cadences involving perfect consonances with the individual pitches of the tenor. At the tenor’s fifth note (the syllable “di-” of “Benedicamus”), Leonin uses the second rhythmic mode in the duplum. When the tenor melisma on “Domino” begins, Leonin creates discantus texture by casting the tenor in mode 5. In addition, there is a rhythmic pattern (note–note–note–rest–note– rest) that commences on the second note of the tenor and repeats six times (a seventh statement is truncated). At the conclusion of the chant melisma, Leonin reverts to melismatic style, the tenor sustaining its final pitch (D) while the duplum wends it way sequentially to its completion. Example 1.10 Leonin: Benedicamus Domino, clausula\n\nOf Leonin’s successor, Perotin (le Grande), the Anonymous IV source writes: [This liber] was in use up to the time of Perotinus, who made a redaction of it [“abbreviavit eundem”] and made many better clausulas that is puncta, he being the best discantor and better (at discant) than Leoninus was. . . . This Magister Perotinus made the best quadrupla, such as Viderunt and Sederunt, with an abundance of striking musical embellishments [“colores armonicae artis”]; likewise, the noblest tripla, such as Alleluia, Posui adiutorium and [Alleluia] Nativitas.18 This brief quote introduces the term clausula, defined as “an independent polyphonic composition that employs a short chant melisma as a cantus firmus.” Anonymous IV states that Perotin “made a redaction” of the Magnus Liber Organi (i.e., a new and ostensibly better edition). His editing might have resulted in shorter, hence “better” clausulae (or puncta) as mentioned by Anonymous IV, as well as the new compositions specifically cited. In making new clausulae, Perotin introduced repetitive rhythmic patterns into the tenor; these evolved into the “isorhythmic technique” of the fourteenth century, as example 1.11 shows. Perotin formalizes Leonin’s occasional use of rhythmic tenor patterns\n\n14\n\nA History of Western Choral Music\n\ninto a short repetitive pattern collectively known as ordines (sing. ordo). This particular ordo is four “measures” long, repeating the pattern L / B–B rest / B–B / B–B rest (L = Longa [usually transcribed as a dotted half], B = Breve [dotted quarter]). This pattern, which appears five times, contains slots for five pitches and two rests. Since the chant melisma has thirty pitches, the final five cannot be used in this construction (mm. 1–20). Comparing Perotin’s tenor with the chant reveals that the pattern concludes (as the editorial text underlay suggests) with the first note of the final syllable “-no.” Thereafter Perotin repeats the entire melisma using a new ordo that reverses the two halves of the original (B–B / B–B– rest / L / B–B rest). By repeating the chant melisma, (a process described as a double cursus from the Latin cursere = to run) Perotin is able to create a longer, more complex composition. Example 1.11 Perotin: Benedicamus omino\n\nDespite the impressive and novel organa tripla and quadrupla described by Anonymous IV, Perotin’s greater historical accomplishment was refurbishing Leonin’s clausulae. These improvements established the precedent of “substitute clausulae,” in which composers upgraded the most interesting parts of the organum, meaning those portions that set the chant melisma in discantus style. The burgeoning popularity of these substitute clausula created a supply of music greater than the liturgical demand, thus leading to a new genre, the motet, which was essentially a clausula with a texted duplum (see ex. 1.12).19 Example 1.12 Motet: Domini fidelium/Domino, mm. 1–22\n\nWestern Choral Music—Medieval Foundations\n\n15\n\nLike the necessary musical agreement of the new voice and the inherited chant, the motettus text referenced the tenor text. In this example, the tenor incipit “Domino” begets a text in which the attributes of “the Lord” are amplified: “Domino fidelium omnium fidelis devocio Laudis cum preconio Jubilet in gaudio.” (“To the faithful Lord of all, let the voices of the faithful devoted ones cry out in joy.”). Perotin’s expansion of polyphonic organum to three and four voices opened up the possibility of motets with two texted upper voices (triplum and motettus). Their melodic and textual differences reinforced the hierarchical construction of medieval polyphony as separate layers written consecutively. Without the plainsong tenor this new musical edifice could not exist either musically or liturgically. Example 1.12 shows that the texts of both upper voices were glosses on the tenor text. Like medieval architects, who were forced to invent new forms of support (e.g., the “flying buttress”) to build ever taller cathedrals, composers who sought to build more complex musical structures first had to create a foundation of common reference that supported the whole. By the late thirteenth century, the format of the motet stabilized as may be seen in the works of such composers as Petrus de Cruce (Pierre de la Croix, fl. late thirteenth century) and Franco of Cologne (fl. mid thirteenth century). In these motets, the triplum and motettus typically have French texts and the tenor (if not a freely composed melody) is a mere vestige of the original chant melisma. The upper voices grew increasingly complex, retaining the hierarchy that assigned more text and music to the triplum than the motettus. This change prompted the invention of “choirbook format,” in which all three vocal parts appear on facing pages.\n\nFigure 1.1 Choirbook format\n\n16\n\nA History of Western Choral Music\n\nIn this figure (Ockeghem’s chanson L’autre dantan taken from the Mellon Chansonnier), the triplum occupies the entire left-hand page (verso), while the shorter motettus and tenor appear on the right-hand (recto) page. We see a particularly striking example of this trend in Petrus de Cruce’s motet Aucun—Lonc tans—Annuntiates, in which sextuplets and other complex rhythms appear in the triplum but not in the motettus.20\n\nThe Ars Nova The advent of the fourteenth century (It., Trecento) was indeed a watershed event in Western European culture. The hegemony of the Roman Catholic Church—celebrated by the Great Jubilee proclaimed by Pope Boniface VII—disintegrated, signaling the end of the church’s domination of culture and political institutions. This decline culminated in the Babylonian Captivity (1305–79) and the Great Schism (1378–1417), in which there were two rival popes, one in France and one in Rome. In 1338 England and France engaged in a conflict (later known as the Hundred Years War, 1338–1453) over ownership of lands in the north of France, a war that wreaked havoc on both kingdoms. At the same time Italy was racked by internal strife between the Guelphs (middle-class partisans of the papacy and popular rule) and the Ghibellines (supporters of the Holy Roman Empire). The bubonic plague, or “black death,” significantly reduced the population of Europe, causing chaos and fear that fueled the breakdown of the established social order. The transition from the thirteenth to the fourteenth century witnessed many developments in the literary and plastic arts that led historians to call this century a “renaissance.” In Italy, the Italian painter Giotto (1266–1337) introduced a new style of painting using “perspective.” The literary outputs of Dante (1265–1321), Petrarch (1307–74), and Boccaccio (1313–75) were acclaimed as the “dolce stile nuove.” In England, unsuccessful attempts at reformation by Jon Wycliffe (1320–84) and the literary works of Geoffrey Chaucer (1340–1400) signaled the arrival of a new era as well. Although the beginning of the musical renaissance was nearly a century away, something new was clearly afoot in the fourteenth century. Among the foremost musicians of the time was Philippe de Vitry (1291–1361), whose treatise Ars Nova defined the age. The treatise advocated the coequal use of duple mensuration. Whereas Notre Dame polyphony essentially recognized only one level of mensuration—the division of the longa into either two or three breves (modus)—Vitry added two new classifications known as tempus (the division of the breve into semibreves) and prolatio (the division of the semibreve into minims). Figure 1.2 shows a synopsis of de Vitry’s system taken from Franchinus Gaffurius’s treatise, Practica musicae (Milan, 1496).21 These two staves each contain both types of tempus—perfect (triple) and imperfect (duple). The first staff illustrates perfect prolation (i.e., three-part division of the semibreve into minims) under both perfect and imperfect time (tempus). The second changes to imperfect or minor prolation. Tucked between the clefs and the actual musical notation are four different mensural signs. These consist of a circle and semicircle (“C”) indicating perfect (triple) and imperfect (duple) time (tempus) respectively, as well as the addition of a dot to these same figures to indicate perfect and imperfect prolation. These four options for metric notation may be thought of, in modern metrical terms, as 9/8, 6/8, 3/4, and 2/4 (reading from left top to right bottom in fig. 1.2). Like modern meter signatures, the presence of one of these signs indicated division of the “measure” (tactus) into either two (imperfect) or three (perfect) parts, each of which may be divided in the same fashion.\n\nWestern Choral Music—Medieval Foundations\n\n17\n\nFigure 1.2 Mensural Proportions, Francinus Gaffurius, Practica Musicae, 1496\n\nIsorhythm A principal focal point of Ars Nova composition was the organization (first undertaken by Leonin and Perotin) of the Gregorian cantus firmus into a series of repeated rhythmic units. The result was isorhythm, a multitiered rhythmic organization, in which the tenor pitch content (color) was organized into a series of repeating rhythmic formulae. The composer’s first task was to select a chant melisma (in this case, the setting of “Do-” from Benedicamus Domino, ex. 1.4) viewed only as a collection of pitches. Next, the composer would design a rhythmic pattern, repetition of which would accommodate the pitch content in a series of whole statements comprised of both pitches and rests. In its simplest form, a direct, arithmetic relationship existed between the number of pitches in the color and the number of “slots” available in the ordo or talea. For example, if there were sixteen pitches in the color, the isorhythmic pattern might well distribute the four pitches to four statements of the rhythmic pattern. In more complicated examples, composers often created a deliberate imbalance between the number of pitches and the structure of the isorhythmic pattern. The same sixteen pitches might be doubled to thirty-two by using a double cursus. In such a case, a composer might create an eleven-pitch isorhythmic pattern. In this hypothetical scenario, the first twenty-two pitches are each factored into two long taleae; the remaining ten notes of the chant would form a third by repeating the final note of the color. Isorhythm was first applied to the tenor; eventually, it spread to other parts, especially the contratenor bassus in a four-part texture. We can see the application of this process in de Vitry’s isorhythmic motet Tuba sacre fidei / In arboris / VIRGO SUM. (The trumpet of the sacred faith / On top of the tree / I am a virgin) The triplum and motettus have different Latin texts, while the textless tenor retains only the incipit Virgo sum to indicate its plainsong source. The two Latin texts, though different in quantity and content, embellish the incipit text (“I am a virgin”) of the tenor.\n\n18\n\nA History of Western Choral Music\n\nTable 1.6 Vitry, Tuba sacre fidei/In arboris, Text\n\nTriplum Text\n\nTranslation\n\nTuba sacre fidei, proprie dicta Dei. Praeca arcanorum in theatris clamitat Quod ratio hesitat, basis peccatorum Fatendum simpliciter credendumque firmiter morive necesse: Deum unum in tribus personibus equalibus et tres unum esse; Virgine non semine viri sed spiramine verbi concepisse; ipsam semper Virginem Deum atque hominem mundo perperisse; Sed trans naturalia ista cum sint omnia credentibus vita neces neglicentibus, Natura quod gressibus ratio potita in permissis dubium gignat et augurium; igitur vitetur et fides per quam via apud archana rea clarior habitur, semper imitetur.\n\nThe trumpet of holy faith is properly called God’s word. The preacher of secret things Repeatedly shouts in assemblies what reason, on which sinners rely, hates to admit, but which must be said simply and believed firmly: the One God is three equal persons and the three are one; that the Virgin, conceived not by the seed of man, but by the breath of the word, is always the virgin who bore God as a man into the world; but since all of these supernatural things are life to the believer (but) death to those who ignore, let that which reason acquired by rational steps give birth to doubt and prediction; It should therefore be avoided and faith, by which the divine way to secret things is clearer, always followed.\n\nMotettus In arboris empiro prospere virginitatis sedet; puerpere mdiatrix fides in medio, cum stipite cecata ratio insecuta septem sororibus, sophismata sua foventibus; Haec ut scandat dum magis nititur ebilitas ramorum frangitur. Petat ergo fidei dexteram vel eternum nitetur perperam.\n\nVirginity sits auspiciously at the top of the tree. Faith, the mediatrix of the one who has borne the child, sits in the middle on the stump of blinded reason, followed by its seven sisters, who try to ascend but can’t be supported by the weak branches. Therefore, let he seek the right hand of faith, or else strive eternally in vain.\n\nClearly, this text is neither biblical nor liturgical but a preachment against reason’s attempts to replace faith. The text is organized into strophes, each comprised of three terzets with the syllable count 7–7–6 and the rhyme scheme aab.22 The text of the motettus is similar in content and organization (five pairs of ten-syllable rhyming lines). Like the triplum, its text refers to the Virgin Mary as the common theological raison d’être for the composition, reflecting her role as mediatrix between God and human beings. De Vitry arranged the twenty-four pitches of the chant melisma (ex. 1.13) into six groups of four divided by rests. Example 1.13 Vitry: In arboris/Tuba sacre fidei/Virgo sum, color\n\nWestern Choral Music—Medieval Foundations\n\n19\n\nLeo Schrade believed that the motet had six taleae, each accommodating eight pitches of the color.23 In reality, Schrade’s six are actually two groups of three, the second being a diminution of the first. The first three taleae each underlay twenty-four “measures” of the upper voices, a duration halved in the final three presentations. Here, we give the rhythmic pattern of the second version (ex. 1.14) because its notation is easier to visualize than the first. Example 1.14 Vitry: In Arboris/Tuba sacre fidei/Virgo sum, talea 2\n\nThe openings of both upper voices (exx. 1.15a and b) suggest derivation from the tenor melody and illustrate the similarity of the motettus to the tenor; examples 1.15 c and d show the triplum’s derivation from the tenor. Example 1.15 Vitry: Tuba sacre fidei/In arboris/Virgo sum (a) Motettus, mm. 1–8 (b) Tenor, mm. 13–20\n\n(c) Triplum, mm. 7–13\n\n(d) Tenor, mm. 37–44\n\n20\n\nA History of Western Choral Music\n\nDespite being composed successively, the triplum and motettus are both consonant with the tenor and feature the use of sequence (ex. 1.16a) and the contrapuntal device of inversion (ex. 1.16b). Example 1.16 Vitry: In arboris/Tuba sacre fidei/Virgo sum (a) Triplum, mm. 56–60\n\n(b) mm. 95–101\n\nHerein lay both the art and the artifice of the isorhythmic motet. While the texts of the upper parts were different in form and size, both were derived from the implied meaning of the tenor’s incipit. Their musical realization was coordinated but yet seemingly unrelated. Likewise, any melodic design in the tenor was deliberately obfuscated by the rhythmic construction of the taleae—the second an exact diminution of the first. And, of course, the duration imposed by the rhythmic format of the talea and the distribution of the color within it had a decided impact on the organization and progress of the upper parts, rhythmically and melodically.\n\nGuillaume de Machaut (ca. 1300–1377) The life of Guillaume de Machaut reflected the opposing cultural tendencies of his time. Evidence of his education from the Roman Church appeared in the first document to acknowledge his existence—a papal bull issued by Pope John XXII in 1330 announced Machaut’s appointment as a canon at Verdun Cathedral. This appointment emanated from Machaut’s employer, King John of Bohemia, whom Machaut served as secretary and notary. In this capacity Machaut traveled widely through Europe, explaining the number of preferments (honorary positions that paid him even though he was neither in residence nor fulfilling any responsibilities!) accorded him. Known primarily as the first composer to set the entire Ordinary of the Mass, Machaut also composed secular vocal compositions (isorhythmic motets and polyphonic settings of formes\n\nWestern Choral Music—Medieval Foundations\n\n21\n\nFigure 1.3 Guillaume de Machaut Receiving Nature\n\nfixes poetry), the breadth and quality of which was remarkable. For choral musicians, however, the Messe de Notre Dame formed the cornerstone of Machaut’s fame. The musicologist Richard Hoppin has summarized its significance: It is his largest single musical work and the only one with a strictly liturgical function. . . . It is the first complete setting of the Ordinary that is known to have been written as a unit by one composer. In length it far exceeds any of the compilations of individual movements that make up other Masses in the fourteenth century. Machaut’s Mass was the only one of its kind, and not until some fifty years after his death did complete Masses begin to appear in the works of early Renaissance composers.24 The origins of this composition remain shrouded in mystery, there being no scholarly agreement about either its date of composition or the occasion for which it was written. Daniel Leech-Wilkinson has posited a relatively late genesis (ca. 1350–72) and the likelihood that the work was a “Lady Mass” sung in honor of Machaut at the Church of Our Lady in Reims.25 Like other anonymous fourteenth-century Mass settings (e.g., the Mass of Tournai), Machaut’s setting lacked modal unity; it also followed the contemporary precedent of using isorhythmic\n\n22\n\nA History of Western Choral Music\n\nstructure for the Kyrie, Sanctus/Agnus Dei, and Ite missa est, and discantus style for the longer Gloria and Credo texts.26 The complexity of the isorhythmic structures and the sophisticated layout of the discantus movements indicate that Machaut’s composition was more advanced than the earlier, anonymous polyphonic masses. Example 1.17 illustrates Machaut’s use of isorhythm. Machaut chose a Dorian chant, the four musical phrases of which serve the principal text divisions—Kyrie 1, Christe, Kyrie 2, and Kyrie 3. These chants shared similar ranges and melodic gestures yet demonstrate an increasing degree of complexity. Machaut seems to have viewed the chants for the first Kyrie and the Christe and the final two Kyrie chants as pairs. Liturgy required three statements of each text, the Kyrie 1 and Christe three times, the Kyrie 2 twice and the final Kyrie once. Accordingly, Machaut provided a polyphonic setting for each of the separate chant phrases. The performer was left with the choice of either using the polyphonic segments throughout or alternating them with the plainsong. The latter choice would result in this sequence: Kyrie 1: polyphony Kyrie 1: plainsong Kyrie 1: polyphony Christe: plainsong Christe: polyphony Christe: plainsong Kyrie 2: polyphony Kyrie 2: plainsong Kyrie 3: polyphony\n\nExample 1.17 Machaut: Messe de Notre Dame, Kyrie chants\n\nSince each chant was different in length, Machaut created isorhythmic patterns that emphasized the similarities of the chant pairs. Machaut arranged the twenty-eight pitches of Kyrie 1 (ex. 1.17) in the simplest possible mathematical arrangement—four pitches for each of the seven rhythmic patterns. He countered this simple structure by creating a contratenor that had a talea equal to three statements of the tenor. Unfortunately, the tenor had seven (not six!) statements, necessitating a third partial statement of the contratenor’s talea. In a similar manner,\n\nWestern Choral Music—Medieval Foundations\n\n23\n\nMachaut divided the twenty-five pitches of the Christe asymmetrically (three times eight pitches plus one, rather than five times five), doubling the length of the Kyrie’s isorhythmic pattern. The four-measure pattern of Kyrie 1 generated the patterns of the other movements. Its four rhythmic components (abac) were rearranged for Kyrie 2 (acbaabba) and Kyrie 3 (acbaeba). Since Kyrie 3 had a seven-measure talea (not eight like Kyrie 2), its final three measures related to the final four of Kyrie 2 in a complex series of variations: the first measure was omitted while the final two were the same (ba); the second measure of 2 was replaced either by the second measure of Kyrie 2 (c) or, in alternating taleae, by an entirely new pattern (e). Thus, Daniel Leech-Wilkinson concludes that the four sections of the Kyrie are closely related: In addition, there are some grounds for believing that they were composed in the order in which they stand: the Christe expands the Kyrie I talea, and Kyrie II that of the Christe, while Kyrie III adapts the structure of Kyrie II in order to accommodate the expanded chant.27 Of course, knowing the mathematical layout of the taleae does not provide a complete picture of the “sound” of the movement. The talea and color of the tenor are matched with the talea of the contratenor and a series of pitches chosen so as to make cadences with the tenor (ex. 1.18). To this contrapuntal pair, Machaut adds rhythmically and melodically freer voices (the triplum and motettus). They are interwoven with the supporting duet of tenor and contratenor (ex. 1.19) to provide a musical structure that sounds enormously complicated and, to modern ears, shockingly dissonant. Example 1.18 Machaut: Messe de Notre Dame, Kyrie taleas\n\nExample 1.19 Machaut: Messe de Notre Dame, Kyrie I, mm. 16–19\n\nNo quantitative analysis can aptly convey the aural impression of this music. To modern ears, the impression is one of a stark and complex beauty dominated by the ebb and flow\n\n24\n\nA History of Western Choral Music\n\nof consonance and dissonance. These changing harmonies reflect the successive composition of the tenor/contratenor, motettus and, finally, triplum, the latter voices being consonant with the tenor but not necessarily with each other. Of note is the frequent appearance of the “double leading tone” cadence (mm. 4–5, 6–7, 10–11, 16–17, and 26–27). The length and complexity of the Gloria and Credo texts forced Machaut to adopt a less intricate musical texture—the note-against-note style known as discantus. Otto Gombosi noted a similarity of structure (as well as texture) in these movements.28 He posited four “stanzas” within the Gloria, each divisible into three periods based on cadences to the final (clos) or another pitch (ouvert). While Daniel Leech-Wilkinson acknowledges Gombosi’s logic, he points out that this analysis fails to account for some significant repetitions of melodic material. Alternatively, he suggests a sevenfold structure based not on cadence type but on the melodic/ harmonic contour (ex. 1.20).29 Apart from the obvious similarity of these melodic units, the strength of this formal plan is that it places the nontexted, “linking” measures (∞) in a constant place within the larger form. Further, the marked similarity of C and D permit the use of one or both segments (as the text requires) without changing significantly the larger formal structure of the movement. Once the text of the Gloria has been set in this more compact, homophonic style, Machaut reverts to isorhythm to set the concluding Amen. Example 1.20 Machaut: Messe de Notre Dame, Gloria\n\nWhile earlier Mass settings had employed a similar textural shift due to text length, Machaut’s setting exceeded these in both structural complexity and the ingenuity with which it is applied. Even though Machaut’s Messe de Notre Dame lacked the kind of musical unity that became normative in the fifteenth century, it stands as the first indisputable masterpiece of that genre, claiming a deserved place of importance in the history of choral music.\n\nConclusion While the material discussed in this chapter might be considered tedious at times, it is absolutely essential that students understand the vital roles that liturgy and modality played in the evolution of Western choral music. In essence, the history of Western music up to the Protestant Reformation is largely the history of the music conceived to serve the needs of the Roman liturgy. We cannot adequately understand the intended function of religious music in the Renaissance (and beyond) without a basic understanding of its role within liturgical worship. As for modality, too many conductors perform the motets and masses of the sixteenth century as if they were tonal pieces with some notes that sound “wrong” (at least within the tonal system adopted in music written after 1700). Our modern system of meter and rhythm derives directly from the mensural system adopted as early as the fourteenth century, and many more contemporary notational practices have their origins in medieval music when notation became an essential if not universal component of performance.\n\n2\n\nSacred Choral Music of the Renaissance, I (1425–1525)\n\nF\n\nor most of the fine arts, the artistic movement known as the Renaissance began somewhere around the fourteenth century. While fourteenth-century musicians recognized a new aesthetic impulse that de Vitry called the Ars nova, the musical renaissance proper began in the early fifteenth century. This chronology is based both on documents that specify a fundamental change in composition and aesthetics around this time, and on the simultaneous rise of true choral singing, the musical unification of the Mass Ordinary cycle, and the appearance of a fundamentally new sound, famously, though questionably, dubbed “le contenance angloise” (translated as something like “The English Way of Doing Things Musically”) by the French cleric and poet Martin le Franc. Nineteenth-century historians had dated the Renaissance as occurring between 1453 and 1517, these years marking two pivotal events in the reawakening of European culture: the fall of Constantinople to the Turks, and the Protestant Reformation. The intervening years saw the voyages of exploration by Columbus, Magellan, and others, and Gutenberg’s invention of the printing press with moveable type (ca. 1450). All of these events were manifestations of a new, inquisitive spirit that elevated the importance of the human intellect. In music, we know that something new was at work from the writings of the humanist theorist and scholar Johannes Tinctoris (ca. 1435–1511), who tells us that a significant break with 25\n\n26\n\nA History of Western Choral Music\n\nthe past has taken place. Consider the following excerpts from two of his treatises—Proportionales Musices (ca. 1476) and Liber de arte contrapuncti (ca. 1477): At this time, consequently, the possibilities of our music have been so marvelously increased that there appears to be a new art, if I may so call it, whose fount and origin is held to be among the English, of whom Dunstable stood forth as chief. Contemporary with him in France were Dufay [sic] and Binchoys to whom directly succeeded the moderns Ockeghem, Busnoys, Regis and Caron, who are the most excellent of all the composers I have ever heard. Nor can the English, who are popularly said to shout while the French sing, stand comparison with them. For the French contrive music in the newest manner for the new times, while the English continue to use one and the same style of composition, which shows a wretched poverty of invention. . . . Further, although it seems beyond belief, there does not exist a single piece of music, not composed within the last forty years that is regarded by the learned as worth hearing.1 These statements indicate that Continental musicians acknowledged a “new art,” the origin of which was English. This new art was developed first by Guillaume Du Fay (ca. 1400–74) and Giles Binchois (ca. 1400–60) and expanded upon by the succeeding generation of Franco-Flemish composers—Johannes Ockeghem (ca. 1410–97), Antoine Busnoys (ca. 1430–96), Johannes Regis (ca. 1430–83), and Firminus Caron (fl. ca. 1460–75). Just how fundamental this change was is indicated by Tinctoris’s striking use of forms of the verb “to hear,” as he more fully explained in his treatise Liber de arte contrapuncti (1477). Music had moved from the speculative realm of medieval philosophy (number, ratio, etc.) into the world of sound and aural beauty. The success of a composition now depended more on what it sounded like than on its structural foundations and symmetries (viz. the art of isorhythm). Tinctoris believed that this change had happened approximately forty years earlier, around 1435. This is the same date cited by Bukofzer as the terminus ante quem for the beginnings of polyphonic compositions expressly written to be sung by an ensemble rather than by soloists (as had been the case in the medieval period).2 The manuscripts that constitute the primary sources of the evolving Mass Ordinary cycle began to be assembled on the Continent at approximately the same time.3 Examining the history of the time, we find that the English (the “fount and origin” of this new style) and the French (who succeed them) are locked in combat with one another for the seemingly interminable Hundred Year’s War (1338–1453). This conflict provided the conduit through which the “contenance angloise” was transmitted to the Continent.4 It also explains the technical difference between the English style and the French attempts to emulate it without fully understanding how it worked. Thus, the English “contenance angloise” became known in France as “fauxbourdon” (“false bass”), alluding to the predominance of chords in “first inversion,” (i.e., without a true bass). Heinrich Besseler has argued that the term fauxbourdon is first used in the Communion (Vos qui secuti estis) of Du Fay’s Missa Sancti Jacobi (ex. 2.1).5\n\nSacred Choral Music I, 1425–1525\n\n27\n\nExample 2.1 DuFay: Missa Sancti Jacobi, Communio, mm. 2–5\n\nIn this movement, only the superius and tenor are notated; the existence of a middle voice is indicated only by the rubric “aux fauxbourdon,” indicating the middle voice sings the superius part a perfect fourth lower. Irrespective of the accuracy of Besseler’s assumption, this piece is a rare example of strict fauxbourdon. Strict examples of this technique are fairly common in the 1420s and 1430s, although relatively less frequent in the compositions of Du Fay.6 More common and important are the effects that fauxbourdon exerts on the contrapuntal and harmonic procedures of the age and in the adaptations of this technique found in the small, homophonic motets of the early fifteenth century.\n\nEarly Fifteenth-Century Motet The advent of the musical Renaissance affects the motet more obviously than the Mass; at the turn of the fifteenth century, the motet is clearly the more progressive genre. While there are more Mass compositions dating from the early fifteenth century than in the preceding century, the earliest Mass compositions—partial or complete—owe their physiognomy to the motet. Machaut’s La Messe de Nostre Dame uses the structural principles of the isorhythmic motet, except when the long texts of the Gloria and Credo make its use impractical. Fifteenth-century composers avoid the complexity of isorhythm and the almost inevitable use of multiple texts that result from it (perhaps a result of the Renaissance’s emerging humanistic concern for textual clarity). That Du Fay and his contemporaries continued to compose isorhythmic motets for occasions of great solemnity or festivity indicates the perceived stature of the inherited style. The “contenance angloise” is most evident in and easily applied to pieces that are smaller, simpler and less intricate (both contrapuntally and mensurally) than their fourteenth-century forebears. These simpler motets show some consistent tendencies—a three-voice texture; the concomitant independence from liturgical cantus firmus; movement away from the artifice of isorhythm; texts and musical settings that reflect an intimacy of style (often associated with veneration of the Virgin Mary), and a musical organization based more on vertical consonance and careful control of dissonance than on contrapuntal procedure. These trends are all visible in the song motets of Dunstable and Du Fay (to name only the most prominent figures among a substantial group of composers). The increased concern with vertical construction culminating in the dominance of the superius melody defines the new, pan-consonant style that characterizes the musical Renaissance.7 A frequently cited exemplar is Dunstable’s Quam pulchra es.8 Strictly speaking, this shows neither English discant nor fauxbourdon: it contains three notated parts, is freely composed, and highlights the superius by clearly separating it from the two lower voices. In Dunstable’s motet this is the only line with text. The textless lower voices (contratenor and tenor) contain many ligatures (indicated in modern critical by the presence of brackets above the notes) that most likely indicate instrumental performance. Often, the lower\n\n28\n\nA History of Western Choral Music\n\nvoices have a signed B♭, while there is none in the superius (a phenomenon known as a “partial signature”). These lower voices tend to have the same range, crossing one another frequently so that neither one forms a true “bass.” For these reasons, Quam pulchra es and pieces like it are said to be in “cantilena” style, a term that reflects the influence of the secular solo song. This same style permeates motets composed by Continental composers such as Guillaume Du Fay. His setting of the Marian antiphon Alma Redemptoris Mater is, for the most part, scored for three voices (ex. 2.2a and b). The superius sings a transposed, paraphrased version of the antiphon’s Gregorian melody. The two lower voices are clearly subordinate to the superius; they seem intended for instrumental performance, generally displaying the same characteristics found in Dunstable’s motet. One intriguing feature of this composition is the use of fermati to produce a solemn presentation of the final invocation and the expansion to four parts for the final cadence. Example 2.2 Alma Redemptoris Mater (a) Gregorian Melody\n\n(b) DuFay, motet, mm. 1–8\n\nIn a setting of the Marian antiphon, Ave regina coelorum (ex. 2.3), Du Fay eschewed both the Gregorian cantus firmus and fauxbourdon in the literal sense. He did, however, shape the contrapuntal design of both the superius and contratenor by his awareness of the emerging co-equality of the third and sixth as pitches used to make concords with the tenor and with each other. Some features of the antiphon’s style (ex. 2.3) suggest antiquity, for example, the “double leading tone” cadences (mm. 3–4, 6–7, 11–12) with parallel fifths and the frequent voice crossings between the contratenor and tenor. Yet, the voices that create these cadences exhibit the typical melodic flow of parallel first-inversion triads found in pieces that use fauxbourdon style. Example 2.3 DuFay: Ave regina cœlorum III, mm. 1–12\n\nSacred Choral Music I, 1425–1525\n\n29\n\nJohannes Tinctoris is among the first to recognize the third and sixth as consonances, writing in his treatise Liber de Arte Contrapuncti: “If there be any third, either perfect or imperfect, either superior or inferior, it is in itself of the highest smoothness, adaptable in the most consonant way to all notes, those at the extremes or medium.”9 This new concern for consonance even affects the isorhythmic motet, a largely medieval genre that continues to have utility in the fifteenth century whenever the occasion requires solemnity. Two outstanding examples of this synergy are Veni Sancte Spiritus by John Dunstable and Guillaume Du Fay’s Nuper rosarum flores, composed for the dedication of Santa Maria del Fiore in Florence on the Feast of the Annunciation (March 25) in 1436. Pope Eugenius IV himself officiated at the dedication of this newly completed church, crowned by a dome of previously unimaginable dimensions designed by Filippo Brunelleschi (1377–1446). Observing liturgical tradition, Du Fay used the Introit Terribilis est locus iste, a text designated for the dedication of churches (“Awesome is this place”), as the cantus firmus of his motet. He assigns the chant to both the tenor and contratenor bassus, who sing it in canon at the fifth, providing an architectural foundation no less impressive than Brunelleschi’s accomplishment. The two upper voices sang a poem celebrating the presence of the pope and his placement of a gilded rose on the altar, a gesture signifying that this cathedral served Florence—the “city of flowers.” The poem’s four strophes provided Du Fay the opportunity to use the same isorhythmic structure in all four basic mensurations. The cantus firmus, appears complete in each verse once, notated in a basic rhythm (integer valor) that the performers have to adjust to conform to changes from one mensuration to another. In other words, at sight, they have to read the same notation as if it were written successively in four different meters, each note shape having a different quantity depending on the mensural sign. The actual notation of the tenor cantus firmus is given in ex. 2.4a (the signature includes all four basic mensural signs).10 The simplest metric expression of this proportion is the length of the four sections in modern notation: Section 1 (3/2) 56 measures\n\nSection 2 (2/2) Section 3 (6/4) Section 4 (2/4) 56 measures 28 measures 28 measures (+2)\n\nThe first two meter signatures produce musical sections that are exactly twice as long as the second pair, this diminution indicated by the vertical slash in the last two signs (C-slash and Circle-slash). Another indicator of this proportional relationship is the number of rests preceding each appearance of the tenor. While all four presentations have fourteen measures of rest preceding the initial entry of the tenor, the diminution of the final two results in half that duration. This number of rests had to remain constant to allow for a single notated statement of Table 2.1 The Mensural Notation System\n\nTempus\n\nProlatio\n\nPerfectum\n\nMaior\n\nPerfectum\n\nMinor\n\nimperfectum\n\nMaior\n\nimperfectum\n\nMinor\n\nSign\n\nSemibreves\n\nMinims\n\nModern 1:4\n\n1:2\n\n1:1\n\n𝇇\n\n𝆹𝆹𝆹\n\n𝆹𝅥𝆹𝅥𝆹𝅥 𝆹𝅥𝆹𝅥𝆹𝅥 𝆹𝅥𝆹𝅥𝆹𝅥\n\n9/8\n\n9/4\n\n9/2\n\n3/4\n\n3/2\n\n3/1\n\n𝇊\n\n𝆹𝆹\n\n𝆹𝅥𝆹𝅥𝆹𝅥 𝆹𝅥𝆹𝅥𝆹𝅥\n\n6/8\n\n6/4\n\n6/2\n\n2/4\n\n2/2\n\n2/1\n\n𝇈 𝇋\n\n𝆹𝆹𝆹 𝆹𝆹\n\n𝆹𝅥𝆹𝅥 𝆹𝅥𝆹𝅥 𝆹𝅥𝆹𝅥 𝆹𝅥𝆹𝅥 𝆹𝅥𝆹𝅥\n\n30\n\nA History of Western Choral Music\n\nthe tenor (ex. 2.4a) and contratenor to be performed four times. Examples 2.4 b–e give the first several notes of the tenor in each of its four appearances to illustrate this proportional relationship. The first notes of each (ex. 2.4 b–e) have durations of dotted whole notes (ex. 2.4b), whole notes (ex. 2.4c), half notes (ex. 2.4d), and dotted half notes (ex. 2.4e) respectively; the singer(s) performing the part realized these changes of mensuration by visually altering the notated cantus firmus. Mathematically, the relationship between the resulting versions of the cantus firmus is 3:2: 1:1.5, or using whole numbers 6–4–2–3. Example 2.4 DuFay: Nuper rosarum flores, Cantus Firmus proportions (a) Integer valor\n\n.\n\n(b) Tempus perfectum\n\n(c) Tempus imperfectum\n\n(d) Tempus imperfectum diminutum\n\n(e) Tempus perfectum diminutum\n\nGiven the isorhythmic intricacies of the tenor, Du Fay’s construction of the upper voices is often overlooked. In each segment of his motet, Du Fay faced the challenge of filling the rests prior to the entry of the tenor/contratenor pair with freely composed music; once the tenor/contratenor pair entered, it effectively limited the pitch content of the superius and contratenor altus to the harmonies implied by the lower voices. One might reasonably expect to find a correlation between the melodies of these voices within triple and duple mensural pairs. Comparison of the altus parts of sections 1 and 2 just after the tenor entrance (at the text “tuus te Florencie”) reveals a nearly identical pitch correspondence between the final twelve\n\nSacred Choral Music I, 1425–1525\n\n31\n\n“measures” of the parts (despite the change of mensuration). This discovery suggests that Du Fay took pains to create these melodies to mirror the larger formal design of the isorhythmic tenor/contratenor.\n\nOrigin of the Cyclic Mass Prior to the Renaissance, there was no compelling need to unify the Mass Ordinary musically; indeed, such musical unification of the Ordinary texts was a matter of little liturgical concern. Even Machaut’s Messe de Notre Dame, despite its prominence as the first Mass Ordinary by a single composer, lacks such intrasectional unification (mode, cantus firmus, etc.). Manfred Bukofzer discussed the beginning of the cyclic Mass as part of a larger musico-liturgical study of the Caput Masses—those built on a cantus firmus consisting of the melisma used to set the word caput (head) in the antiphon (Venit ad Petrum) used during foot-washing ritual on Maunday Thursday.11 Contrary to logic and previous historical surveys, current scholarship now believes that polyphonic settings of Mass texts existed concurrently as separate movements, paired movements (most often Gloria/Credo or Sanctus/Agnus pairs12) and complete cycles. Bukofzer’s description of early methods of unification in Mass pairs (either Gloria/Credo or Sanctus/Agnus) specifies two techniques, one associated with Continental composers and the other with English composers. The practice preferred on the Continent involved use of the same “motto” to begin each movement. The English favored a chant melody common to both movements, an idea of far greater significance in Mass composition. In his 1966 JAMS article, Philip Gossett mentions similarity of mode, mensural sign/s, and clefs as primary means of unifying Mass pairs, even works written separately or by different composers. Obviously, these methods of unification are not of the same order of significance as motto and cantus firmus technique. We must even acknowledge the possibility that Mass pairs and even full cycles were the creation of the scribes tasked with assembling a manuscript, regardless of the original intention of the composer. Ultimately, Renaissance Masses assume one of two archetypes—cantus firmus and parody. A cantus firmus Mass uses the same monophonic melody at least once in each movement. In the early fifteenth century, this melody is typically a liturgical chant deployed in the tenor. These so-called tenor Masses dominate the early Mass cycles, beginning with English composers like John Dunstable (ca. 1490–53) and Leonel Power (d. 1445). Their Masses reveal different approaches to cantus firmus use. In Power’s Missa Alma Redemptoris Mater, for example, the Marian antiphon appears in the same rhythmic and intervallic form in each movement. Dunstable’s Missa Rex Seculorum, however, elaborates the melody differently in each movement (some sources even attribute this work to Power). Shortly after midcentury, the sources of tenor melody were expanded to include secular chansons. Since many of these were polyphonic compositions, Masses based on them naturally began to borrow more than a single voice.13 This procedure marked the beginning of what was to become the parody Mass—one that used a polyphonic rather than a monophonic model.14 This process dominated the majority of Masses by Orlandus Lassus (1532–94), Giovanni Pierluigi da Palestrina (ca. 1525–94), and Tomas Luis da Victoria (1549–1611).\n\n32\n\nA History of Western Choral Music\n\nMasses of Guillaume Du Fay Between the periods dominated by tenor Mass and parody Mass was one in which Mass composition began to expand the sources and manipulation of the cantus firmus. Around 1450, the most important composers of Masses resided on the Continent. Guillaume Du Fay and such contemporaries as Johannes de Lymburghia, Johannes Ciconia, and Arnold and Hugo de Lantins assumed leadership positions, even though their models were still primarily English.15 Du Fay’s seven complete Masses were of two principal types: plenary Masses, which set not only the Ordinary texts but also the Propers, and full Ordinary cycles. Du Fay’s Missa Sancti Jacobi and Missa Sti. Anthonii de Padua, both written in the 1430s, exemplify the first type, three-voice settings of both the Proper and Ordinary texts. By midcentury Du Fay had composed two Masses based on secular cantus firmi—the Missa Se la face ay pale (using the tenor of his own ballade of the same name) and what some regard as among the first in the long series of Masses based on L’Homme Armé. These were followed by two Marian Masses—the Missa Ave regina coelorum (based on Du Fay’s four-voice motet) and the Missa Ecce ancilla Domini. In addition to the increasing variety of tenor melodies, Du Fay’s Masses show different approaches to what was still, nominally, a tenor Mass. His first step involved the deliberate omission of the cantus firmus for portions of certain movements. This trend most often affected the Kyrie, Sanctus, and Agnus Dei, movements with brief and formally simple schemes that typify Du Fay and other composers. The result was a musical form primarily based on the presence or absence of the cantus firmus: Kyrie: cantus firmus/full texture Christe: no cantus firmus/reduced texture Kyrie: cantus firmus/full texture Sanctus: cantus firmus/full texture Pleni sunt: no cantus firmus/reduced texture Osanna: cantus firmus/full texture Benedictus: no cantus firmus/reduced texture Osanna: cantus firmus/full texture Agnus Dei 1: cantus firmus/full texture Agnus Dei 2: no cantus firmus/reduced texture Agnus Dei 3: cantus firmus/full texture The pattern of textual division (and hence cantus firmus deployment) is less predictable in the Gloria and Credo; their longer texts afford composers more options in creating internal subdivisions. Du Fay’s approach to the cyclic tenor Mass is typified by his Missa Se la face ay pale.16 Du Fay scored the Mass for four voices (SATB), adding the contratenor bassus (“low contratenor”) voice beneath the tenor to allow a wider array of harmonies than would have been available if the cantus firmus were the lowest voice. In addition to the presence of the cantus firmus, Du Fay began each movement with a melodic head motive (ex. 2.5a–f).\n\nSacred Choral Music I, 1425–1525\n\n33\n\nExample 2.5 DuFay: Missa Se la face ay pale (a) Kyrie, mm. 1–3\n\n(b) Gloria, mm. 1–4\n\n(c) Credo, mm. 1–4\n\n(d) Sanctus, mm. 1–4\n\n(e) Agnus Dei I, mm. 1–3\n\n(f ) Agnus Dei II, mm. 1–4\n\nFor the Kyrie, Du Fay divided his cantus firmus into two roughly equal parts, which were deployed as the flanking Kyrie sections, omitting the cantus firmus in the Christe (ex. 2.6). Example 2.6 DuFay: Se la face ay pale, tenor\n\n34\n\nA History of Western Choral Music\n\nDu Fay’s decision to avoid the cantus firmus in the Christe required a change of compositional approach. Initially, Du Fay used his motto theme (ex. 2.7a) to create a contrapuntal duo (S and A). A later duo contains some incipient imitation (ex. 2.7b) and concludes with a three-part, fauxbourdon-like passage. For the tripartite Agnus Dei, Du Fay deployed the cantus firmus in the same way. The Sanctus is similar in design, its five sections alternating between full (with tenor) and reduced (without tenor) textures. Here, Du Fay needed a tripartite division of the cantus firmus, which he created by subdividing the first binary segment into two parts (marked with + sign in ex. 2.6). Example 2.7 DuFay: Missa Se la face ay pale, Christe (a) mm. 1–4\n\n(b) mm. 45–51\n\nDu Fay—Missa Se la face a pale, Sanctus Sanctus (Full): CF uses first thirty-six pitches of the tenor Pleni (S, A, B trio): No cantus firmus Osanna (Full): Cantus firmus starts at + (repeating the final eleven pitches used in the Kyrie) and concludes just before * Benedictus (S, A, B Trio): No cantus firmus Osanna (Full): Cantus firmus from * to the end This plan produces a small overlap in the use of the tenor cantus firmus; the Sanctus ends with the eleven pitches (after the +) that is the beginning of the tenor in the final Osanna. The differences in text length that had led Machaut to forsake isorhythm in favor of discantus technique in the Gloria and Credo of his Messe de Notre Dame prompted Du Fay to\n\nSacred Choral Music I, 1425–1525\n\n35\n\nalter his cantus firmus use. In both movements, the tenor is notated once with the following Latin rubric: Tenor ter dicitur. Primo quaelibet figura crescit in triplo, secundo in duplo, tertia ut jacet. The tenor sounds three times. The first statement is tripled in length, the second is doubled, the third sung as it “lies” (i.e., integer valor) This phenomenon is clearly visible in the manuscript version of the Mass (fig. 2.1) currently housed in the Sistine Chapel library. The illustration shows folio 99 recto, which\n\nFigure 2.1 Du Fay, Missa Se la face ay pale, tenor, CS 14\n\n36\n\nA History of Western Choral Music\n\ncontains the conclusion of the bassus (first two lines), the contratenor altus (lines 3–8), and the beginning of the tenor (“Adoramus te”). The tenor begins with the cantus firmus in integer valor (as notated in the Ballade), but, as instructed by the rubric sings it so that “half note” of the original are now equal to an entire “measure” of the surrounding voices, thus, three times as long. This illustration affords us the opportunity to examine some aspects of Du Fay’s notational practices. Typically, his notation is described as “white, mensural notation”; the adjective “white” referring to the prominence of “void” notational shapes (not black), while “mensural” refers to the layered system of rhythmic notation in service since the late thirteenth century. Reading the notation of Renaissance music, whether manuscript or printed, requires understanding the notation of clefs, mensural signs, notes of various shapes and their corresponding rests, ligatures, and coloration. The clefs are, for the most part, C clefs—the line on which the clef (shaped like the letter C) appears becomes middle C. The bass part is usually notated with an F clef, which usually appears on the fourth line of the staff (but in chiavette or “high” clefs on line 3). The mensural system, described in ­chapter 1, became simpler in the fifteenth century because of the elimination of the “modus” layer (i.e., the division of the longae into breves); music of this period typically deals only with the levels of tempus and prolation, which, as shown in the figure, can be either perfect or imperfect. “Perfection” indicates the ternary division of the principal unit (breve for tempus, semibreve for prolation), while imperfect dictated duple division. The most frequently encountered notational shapes are the breve, semibreve, minim, and semiminim (transcribed, in modern editions, as whole, half, quarter, and eighth notes respectively). Imperfect “time” was indicated by a semicircle (C) and perfect time by a closed circle (O). In earlier mensural notation, the insertion of a dot within either of these signs indicated “perfect” prolation. There were specific rests for each of notational values (breve, semibreve, minim, and semiminim) that applied regardless of the mensuration (ex. 2.8). Figure 2.1 contained multiple breve rests, notated in groups of four that resemble “railroad tracks” (ex. 2.9). The use of ligatures goes back to the oldest known notation (neumes); as the etymology of the word implies, ligatures were multiple note forms that are “tied together.” In the notational system used throughout the Renaissance, ligatures had several practical implications, the most important being the way the ligature’s shape affected the value of each constituent note. For the most accessible summary of these rules see Willi Apel’s landmark study of notation.17 Here is a synopsis of some general rules commonly applicable to ligatures: Example 2.8 Rests\n\nExample 2.9 Group of rests\n\nSacred Choral Music I, 1425–1525\n\n37\n\nRules regarding ligatures\n\n1. Normal ligatures have the values of breve and long in specific ascending or descending shapes. 2. If a descending stem is added or deleted the value of that part gaining or losing the stem is changed from long to breve or breve to long. 3. All internal notes are breves. 4. If the final note is an oblique, it is a breve. 5. An initial ascending stem makes the first two values semibreves. Another subject raised by the facsimile of Du Fay’s Missa Se la face ay pale (fig. 2.1) is coloration, a complex subject, prone to exceptions that make any generalization difficult. In theory, coloration (either red or black) reduced the affected notes to two-thirds of its original value; in practice, then, three blackened semibreves would be equal to in duration to two normal semibreves (hence, the colored semibreves are a “triplet” of the uncolored semibreves). Coloration was sometimes used (especially in madrigals) to indicate emotion without affecting the duration of the note/s. In some cases, coloration of a single note of a ligature simply means that the two notes are transcribed unequally (e.g., as dotted quarter and eighth). Using these tools, we can now transcribe a portion of the tenor of the Gloria of Du Fay’s Missa Se la face ay pale (ex. 2.10a–c). Example 2.10 Dufay: Missa Se la face ay pale, Gloria (a) Transcribed as “Integer Valor,” mm. 165–170\n\n(b) Transcribed as “Crescit in duplo,” mm. 125–140\n\n(c) Transcribed as “Crescit in triplo,” mm. 19–35\n\nDu Fay’s rubric regarding the manipulation of the tenor in the Gloria and Credo movements now comes fully into play. The notated tenor appears “as it lies” in the final measures of the Gloria (ex. 2.10a). It is preceded by versions that are two (ex. 2.10b) and three times as long (ex. 2.10c) but notated the same. If one compares the modern version of the tenor opening with the integer valor version seen in CS 14 (Figure 2.1), the six measures of rest in the\n\n38\n\nA History of Western Choral Music\n\ntenor (the two parallel lines that extend from the top staff line to the fourth) equal eighteen measures in the other parts (hence “crescit in triplo”). To perform this part from the manuscript required one to read one tactus (beat) of the other three parts as one-third of the tenor’s measure (thus six notated measures of rest in the tenor are equivalent to eighteen measures of rest in the other parts). Composing a tenor or cantus firmus Mass involved balancing unity (i.e., presenting the cantus firmus intact) and variety. The composers of the generation following Du Fay tended to compose more Mass cycles than their predecessors. Although they paid lip service to the use of a cantus firmus, they tended to explore a wider range of options for its use, some of which minimized its importance while others treated in increasingly novel ways. Such Masses create difficulties of taxonomy (classification) and chronology in the Masses of Johannes Ockeghem and his contemporaries, all of whom struggled to find increasingly varied ways to compose Masses. One obvious change was the increased use of secular cantus firmi. Five of Ockeghem’s fourteen Masses took at least one voice part from contemporary chansons (by Ockeghem himself or someone else); these include the Masses on Fors seulement (à 5), Ma maitresse, De plus en plus, Au travail suis, and, of course, L’Homme Armé. The use of only the tenor of a secular polyphonic model was no longer a given; Ockeghem used both the superius and tenor of his chanson Ma maistresse in his Mass based on that chanson.\n\nThe Ockeghem Generation Such manipulations of the cantus firmus became common in the second half of the fifteenth and early sixteenth centuries. To get a sense of how diverse these practices were, one need only examine the Masses on L’Homme Armé by Du Fay, Ockeghem, Busnoys, Jakob Obrecht (ca. 14"
