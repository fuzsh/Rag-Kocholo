        "text": "The querelle des bouffons was nearly over when Pancrace Royer, a French composer with a fondness for Italian music, made his contribution: a choral version of Pergolesi’s Stabat mater that became one of the most frequently played pieces in the history of the Paris Concert Spirituel. Other choral arrangements followed by Hiller, Vogler, Eybler, Salieri, and Lvov. Royer’s score, had it survived, could have told us much about why the Stabat appealed to broader audiences than had La serva padrona. A choral version of the Stabat survives in Lyon, written in the hand of Nicolas-Antoine Bergiron de Briou, who was active in the Concert de Lyon for almost half a century. Is it a copy of Royer’s work? Two newly identified chorus parts from the Concert Spirituel music library suggest that it is, but there are discrepancies that cannot, as of yet, be explained. My research on the filiation issue generated insight into a broader question: how did French arrangers modify the new Italian style to make it more attractive to French audiences? The adjustments were remarkably few: restructuring the work to fit into a familiar genre; increasing contrast between movements by inserting choruses; replacing alien castrato voices with more familiar ones; cutting out phrase repetitions; deemphasizing fast movements in sacred music, and shortening a lengthy work. These changes gave the galant style a broader base in France, and within twenty years, the long reign of seventeenth-century operas and motets came to an end there."
