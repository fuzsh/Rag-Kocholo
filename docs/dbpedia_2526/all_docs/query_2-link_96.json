        "text": "Composition\n\nIn convertendo is one of the four surviving church works of Rameau's early career, dating to the period 1710-1714 when he was working in Dijon or Lyon; other similar works are known to be lost. The work was rewritten and updated in style for a performance at the Concert spirituel in Paris in 1751. The manuscript of the 1751 version, now in the Bibliothèque nationale de France, was originally in the collection of Jacques Joseph Marie Decroix, the lawyer and friend of Rameau who built a large collection of his manuscripts after the composer's death. The motet is scored for soloists, choir, strings and woodwind, and includes, after the fourth verse, a verse not in the original psalm, Laudate nomen Deo cum cantico (Praise the name of God in song). The final verse is composed to include a fugue which, in the opinion of Reiner Moritz, \"can stand direct comparison with ... Rameau's contemporary J. S. Bach\".\n\nText\n\nThe Latin text is given below alongside the translation of the psalm in the King James Bible. The text in square brackets is not in the original psalm.\n\nRecordings\n\nWilliam Christie (conductor), Les Arts Florissants chorus and orchestra. CD.
