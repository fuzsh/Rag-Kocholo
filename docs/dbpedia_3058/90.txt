Ronald Howard is a newly-minted engineer COMPELLED to help in a jewel robbery. It's a dull little crime drama from the Danziger Brothers, in which the plot is expanded by suspicions of his wife, Beth Rogan, who thinks he is having an affair, and Jack Melford, who turns up a couple of times to threaten the thieves with a gun, mostly to stretch it out to second feature length. It's cheap and tawdry and under an hour and not really worth your time.

Howard is more interesting for being the son of Leslie Howard; he had small roles in two of his father's movies, and for playing Sherlock Holmes in almost forty episodes of a syndicated show in the 1950s.He had a nice career on the big and little screens, but rarely in anything that makes him stand out.
