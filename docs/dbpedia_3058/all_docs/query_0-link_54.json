        "text": "Sean Connery\n\nSean Connery, the rugged, sardonically assured Scotsman who won an Academy Award and portrayed James Bond seven times, proving to the world that nobody could do it better, died Oct. 31 at 90.\n\n“A sad day for all who knew and loved my dad and a sad loss for all people around the world who enjoyed the wonderful gift he had as an actor,” his son Jason told the BBC.\n\nA man with the Midas touch when it came to Agent 007, Connery laid down the Bond blueprint by starring in the first five United Artists movies to feature Ian Fleming’s British superspy: Dr. No (1962), From Russia With Love (1963) — said to be the actor’s personal favorite — Goldfinger (1964), Thunderball (1965) and You Only Live Twice (1967). That fulfilled his original contract. Connery always resisted becoming a one-note actor and starred in a wide array of films, often playing a no-nonsense, man of action — like the tough, Irish cop who mentors Kevin Costner’s Eliot Ness in The Untouchables (1987), directed by Brian De Palma. That role earned him his Oscar.\n\nAlex Trebek\n\nAlex Trebek, the polished host of Jeopardy! who for nearly four decades was the man with the answers — all in the form of a question, of course — died Nov. 8 at 80.\n\nOn March 6, 2019, the game show icon revealed that he had been diagnosed with Stage 4 pancreatic cancer, but he vowed to beat it “because under the terms of my contract, I have to host Jeopardy! for three more years.” In November 2018, he had extended his deal through 2022.\n\nIn the weeks following his stunning announcement, hundreds of thousands of messages were sent to the host — all of which he read, according to a second video in which he thanked those folks for their support and encouragement. He said he lost his hair during cancer treatments and wore a hairpiece on the air.\n\nPresiding over a glossy rebooted version of Jeopardy! since fall 1984, the good-natured Trebek collected seven Daytime Emmys from 34 nominations and a Peabody Award for his work on the show. He hosted in the vicinity of a Guinness World Record 8,000 episodes — all from the Sony Pictures lot in Culver City since 1994 — taping multiple installments two days a week for about 45 weeks a year.\n\nCarl Reiner\n\nCarl Reiner, the quintessential straight man for Sid Caesar and Mel Brooks who based the beloved sitcom The Dick Van Dyke Show on his own life and jump-started Steve Martin’s big-screen career, died June 29. He was 98. The influential writer, director, actor, author and multiple Emmy Award-winner died at his Beverly Hills home of natural causes. Son Rob Reiner, the actor, writer, director and Oscar-nominated producer, said in a tweet Tuesday morning: \"Last night my dad passed away. As I write this my heart is hurting. He was my guiding light.\"\n\nBorn in the Bronx, Reiner came to prominence in the 1950s as a performer and writer on Caesar’s legendary live variety programs Your Show of Shows and Caesar’s Hour. From those writers rooms, he and Brooks began a lifelong friendship, and the two birthed one of the great two-man comedy routines of all time, The 2000 Year Old Man. In 1959, Reiner was being offered sitcom work but didn’t like any of the scripts he was reading. His late wife, Estelle, told him he could write a better one. “And I said, ‘Well, I live in [New York City suburb] New Rochelle. I’m married. I have two kids. I work in New York. I’m a writer on a television variety show, Your Show of Shows. Write about that.’ And that’s how Head of the Family, which would become The Dick Van Dyke Show, was born.\"\n\nReiner stepped out from his straight-man shackles to star in the Norman Jewison comedy The Russians Are Coming, the Russians Are Coming (1966) as the father of a vacationing family in New England. He also played con man Saul Bloom in Steven Soderbergh’s Oceans Eleven flicks, was on a panel that roasted the insecure late night host of The Larry Sanders Show, won his final Emmy for portraying “TV legend” Alan Brady on Mad About You and appeared as a movie producer on Two and a Half Men. Behind the camera, Reiner was instrumental in the movie career of Martin, who had been a writer with Rob Reiner on CBS’ The Smothers Brothers Show. He directed the stand-up genius in four films, including his big-screen starring debut, The Jerk (1979).\n\nOlivia De Havilland\n\nOlivia de Havilland, the delicate beauty and last remaining star of Gone With the Wind who received her two acting Oscars after helping to take down Hollywood’s studio system with a landmark legal victory in the 1940s, died July 26. She was 104. De Havilland died of natural causes at her home in Paris, where she had lived for more than 60 years, publicist Lisa Goldberg announced.\n\nShe was the older sister (by 15 months) and rival of fellow Academy Award-winning actress Joan Fontaine, who died in December 2013 at age 96. Fontaine won her only Oscar in 1942 for Suspicion, beating out fellow nominee de Havilland. De Havilland captured her best actress Oscar statuettes for To Each His Own (1946), in which she played an unwed mother who is forced to give up her baby and loves him from afar, and The Heiress (1949), where she starred as a vulnerable woman who falls hard for a handsome journeyman (Montgomery Clift) against the wishes of her emotionally abusive father (Ralph Richardson). She was the oldest surviving Oscar-winning actor.\n\nFor her performance as the sweet and suffering Melanie in Gone With the Wind (1939), de Havilland earned her first Oscar nom, but in the supporting actress category, she lost to fellow castmember Hattie McDaniel. She also was nominated for her turns in Hold Back the Dawn (1941), where she played a spinsterish schoolteacher wooed by Charles Boyer, and The Snake Pit (1948), a harrowing film that had de Havilland's character in an asylum for reasons she can’t recall. It was one of the earliest films to attempt a realistic portrayal of mental illness and perhaps the most challenging role of her fabled career.\n\nIn addition to her award-winning turns, de Havilland was a true star, playing in a number of the day’s most popular movies. She appeared in nine films at Warner Bros. opposite the dashing Errol Flynn, including The Adventures of Robin Hood (1938), where she played a sweet Maid Marian, and she teamed with director Michael Curtiz nine times as well.\n\nRegis Philbin\n\nRegis Philbin, the indefatigable and downright neighborly host of talk shows and game shows who spent more time in front of a television camera than anyone else, died July 24 at 88 of natural causes, according to a family statement. \"His family and friends are forever grateful for the time we got to spend with him — for his warmth, his legendary sense of humor and his singular ability to make every day into something worth talking about,\" they said. \"We thank his fans and admirers for their incredible support over his 60-year career and ask for privacy as we mourn his loss.\"\n\nUnfailingly perky and personable during his 60-plus years in show business, Philbin hosted live morning programs from Los Angeles and New York from the early 1970s through 2011, sharing cups of coffee and flipping through the morning papers alongside the likes of Ruta Lee, Sarah Purcell, Cyndy Garvey, Mary Hart, Kathie Lee Gifford and Kelly Ripa. Like Jack Paar before him, Philbin engaged his audience with tales about his personal life and the seemingly mundane events of his day. Philbin made his mark in primetime as host of Who Wants to Be a Millionaire, helping transform ratings-laggard ABC into the No. 1 network in 1999-2000 by drawing audiences of 30 million to a game show that aired three and then five times a week.\n\nWilford Brimley\n\nWilford Brimley, the actor with the walrus mustache whose down-home geniality seen in such films as Cocoon, The Natural and Absence of Malice endeared him to moviegoers, died Aug. 1 at 85.\n\nThe Salt Lake City native, who also stood out as the plant foreman who becomes a confidant of Jack Lemmon's character in The China Syndrome (1979), died in a hospital in St. George, Utah, his manager, Lynda Bensky, told The Hollywood Reporter. She said Brimley had been on dialysis and had other medical issues. He had lived since 2004 on a ranch in Greybull, Wyoming.\n\n\"Wilford Brimley was a man you could trust,\" Bensky noted. \"He said what he meant and he meant what he said. He had a tough exterior and a tender heart. I'm sad that I will no longer get to hear my friend's wonderful stories. He was one of a kind.\"\n\nOn television, Brimley starred on the 1986-88 NBC family drama Our House as a retired widower who, after the death of his son, takes in his daughter-in-law (Deidre Hall) and her three kids (the oldest was Shannen Doherty). Earlier, he had a recurring role on the legendary CBS family drama The Waltons as the soft-spoken Walton's Mountain resident Horace Brimley.\n\nBrimley was back as his world-weary self as New York Knights manager Pop Fisher in Barry Levinson's The Natural (1984), where he worked alongside Robert Duvall, who years earlier had influenced his decision to pursue acting. In Cocoon (1985), directed by Ron Howard, Brimley portrayed Ben Luckett, one of the residents of the Sunny Shores retirement home whose health miraculously improves after a dip in the pool next door.\n\nBrimley never seemed far away from his fans, regularly popping up in commercials for Quaker Oats oatmeal or to tout the importance of diabetes testing (he himself was a diabetic).\n\nKelly Preston\n\nKelly Preston, the actress who starred in such movies as Jerry Maguire, SpaceCamp, For Love of the Game, and, most recently, opposite husband John Travolta in Gotti, died July 12. She was 57.\n\nPreston died Sunday after a two-year battle with breast cancer, Travolta wrote on Instagram. \"It is with a very heavy heart that I inform you that my beautiful wife Kelly has lost her two-year battle with breast cancer,\" he wrote. \"She fought a courageous fight with the love and support of so many. My family and I will forever be grateful to her doctors and nurses at MD Anderson Cancer Center, all the medical centers that have helped, as well as her many friends and loved ones who have been by her side. Kelly’s love and life will always be remembered. I will be taking some time to be there for my children who have lost their mother, so forgive me in advance if you don’t hear from us for a while. But please know that I will feel your outpouring of love in the weeks and months ahead as we heal.\"\n\nThe news of her breast cancer battle came as a surprise to many. Her rep acknowledged in a statement to People that she had chosen to keep her diagnosis private.\n\nIn addition to 1996's Jerry Maguire, Preston's credits also included 1986's SpaceCamp, 1988's Twins, 1998's Jack Frost, 1999's For Love of the Game and 2003's View From the Top and The Cat in the Hat. She starred opposite Travolta in several films, including 1989's The Experts, 2000's Battlefield Earth and 2009's Old Dogs. Her most recent screen credit was 2018's Gotti, in which she played Victoria Gotti, the wife of mob boss John Gotti, who was played by Travolta.\n\nIan Holm\n\nIan Holm, the versatile British character actor who earned an Oscar nomination for his turn as the athletics trainer in Chariots of Fire and portrayed the hobbit Bilbo Baggins in four movies, died June 19. He was 88. Holm died \"peacefully in hospital\" of an illness that was related to Parkinson’s disease, his agent said in a statement.\n\nHolm gained many sci-fi admirers for his performances as Ash, the decapitated android who keeps on going, in Ridley's Scott's Alien (1979) and as the office manager Mr. Kurtzmann in another classic, Terry Gilliam's fantastical Brazil (1985). A member of the Royal Shakespeare Company starting in the 1950s, Holm collected Tony and Olivier awards before a case of stage fright that blindsided him during previews for The Iceman Cometh left him queasy about working in front of a live audience for more than a decade. Holm cemented his place in British cinema history when he played the eccentric track coach Sam Mussabini in the historical sporting drama Chariots of Fire (1981). The film, one of England's most beloved, took the Oscar for best picture, and Holm was nominated for best supporting actor (he lost out to countryman John Gielgud of Arthur). Holm later portrayed Bilbo, all for Peter Jackson, in The Lord of the Rings films The Fellowship of the Ring (2001) and The Return of the King (2003) and in The Hobbit installments An Unexpected Journey (2012) and The Battle of the Five Armies (2014).\n\nEarl Cameron\n\nEarl Cameron, the pioneering Black actor from Bermuda who starred in the 1951 British film Pool of London and later appeared in movies from Thunderball to Inception, died July 3. He was 102. Director Basil Dearden cast Cameron as a sailor who romances a white girl (Susan Shaw) against the backdrop of racism and crime in Pool of London. His was the first major role for a Black actor in a British mainstream film, and the interracial relationship depicted in the movie broke ground as well.\n\nDearden revisited interracial relationships in Sapphire (1959), in which Cameron played the title character's brother, a doctor. And in Flame in the Streets (1961), directed by Roy Ward Baker, Cameron starred as a factory worker set to receive a promotion, much to the resentment of his white colleagues. The courtly Cameron also played a sympathetic doctor during a Kenyan uprising in Simba (1955), a shipmate in Tarzan the Magnificent (1960), a captain in John Guillermin's Guns at Batasi (1964), a British Secret Service contact who runs a boating supply shop in the 007 film Thunderball (1965) and an ambassador opposite Sidney Poitier in A Warm December (1973).\n\nIn a statement, Cameron's children said: \"Our family has been overwhelmed by the outpourings of love and respect we have received at the news of our father's passing. … As an artist and as an actor, he refused to take roles that demeaned or stereotyped the character of people of color. He was truly a man who stood by his moral principles and was inspirational.\"\n\nHonor Blackman\n\nHonor Blackman, the beguiling British actress who portrayed the leather-clad Cathy Gale on TV's The Avengers and then Pussy Galore in Goldfinger, died on April 6. She was 94. Blackman, who first won recognition for her performance as Elizabeth Taylor's friend in the MGM spy tale Conspirator (1949), died at her home in Lewes, Sussex, of natural causes unrelated to the coronavirus. Considered a real-life goddess to her adoring fans, Blackman joined the British series The Avengers for its second season in 1962 as Mrs. Gale. Blackman often was cast as a demure young woman in such late 1940s films as Daughter of Darkness, Quartet and A Boy, A Girl and a Bike. In 1950, she appeared in So Long at the Fair with Dirk Bogarde and the following year performed opposite Roger Livesey and Richard Burton in Green Grow the Rushes. She won notice in The Square Peg (1958) and A Matter of WHO (1961), with Terry-Thomas. Those performances led to her casting as the imperious Mrs. Gale. Blackman followed Goldfinger with three films released in 1965: The Secret of My Success, a comedy with Shirley Jones and Stella Stevens; the drama Life at the Top (1965), also starring Laurence Harvey; and the tragic love story Moment to Moment. In 1966, she starred in the West End production of Wait Until Dark. More recently, Blackman appeared in Bridget Jones's Diary (2001), Color Me Kubrick (2005), the noir thriller I, Anna (2012) and Cockneys vs. Zombies (2012).\n\nRoy Horn\n\nRoy Horn, the masterful showman who captivated the Las Vegas Strip for more than a quarter-century as one-half of Siegfried & Roy, only to see his career end abruptly as the result of a horrible accident during a 2003 performance, died on May 8 in Las Vegas of complications from COVID-19. He was 75. With its breathtaking theatrics — which included extravagant costumes and sets, pulsating lighting, pyrotechnics and feats of illusion — a Siegfried & Roy magic act at The Mirage was one of the most dazzling live performances ever produced, epitomizing the glitz and glamour of the city. They were headliners at the hotel for more than 13 years. But what made their show a must-see event were the tigers and lions that Fischbacher — Horn's partner in life as well as show business — would make appear and disappear. The sheer danger of having hundred-pound animals a stone's throw from the crowd heightened the thrill, and at the height of its popularity, the act grossed $45 million a year, making them the most successful live entertainers in the history of Las Vegas. Horn, the animal lover and trainer, would conceive a flaming dragon or suggest he ride an elephant onto the stage. He then left it to Fischbacher, the magician, to figure out how to make it happen. Siegfried & Roy performed onstage one last time at a 2009 charity event to benefit Las Vegas' Cleveland Clinic Lou Ruvo Center for Brain Health. In a poignant farewell, Horn limped across the stage.\n\nJames Lipton\n\nJames Lipton, the elegant, articulate wordsmith and theater academic whose desire to give his acting students a greater insight into their art led to the popular Bravo series Inside the Actors Studio, died March 2. He was 93. Lipton passed away at his home in Manhattan from bladder cancer, his wife, Kedakai Mercedes Lipton, told The Hollywood Reporter.\n\n\"He lived each day as if it were his last,\" Kedakai Lipton said in a statement to THR. \"His work was his passion, loved what he did and all the people he worked with. He empowered people to do their best and hopefully his spirit, curiosity and passion will live on.\"\n\nConceived by Lipton in 1994, Inside the Actors Studio was created to serve as a thinly disguised master class for the students of the Actors Studio Drama School, a joint venture of the Actors Studio and The New School. With Paul Newman as its initial guest, each one-hour program featured a top performer in an intimate and in-depth one-on-one interview with Lipton. Nearly 300 subjects, including many Oscar and Emmy winners, shared the secrets of their craft with Lipton and his audience of students before the TV cameras. The show became one of cable's longest-running series.\n\nTom Pollock\n\nTom Pollock, the former chairman of Universal Pictures and the American Film Institute, died Aug. 1 at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles following a heart attack. He was 77. Director-producer Rob Cohen, Pollock's close friend and former client, confirmed the news of Pollock's death. \"He was an amazing man,\" Cohen said.\n\nPollock began his career as an entertainment lawyer, ultimately becoming senior partner at Pollock, Bloom and Dekom. As an attorney, he worked with filmmakers such as George Lucas, who was one of Pollock's first clients. Pollock worked alongside Lucas while he worked on his film THX-1138 and later helped Lucas in the negotiations of Star Wars merchandising and sequel rights. He also negotiated all the legal deals for Lucas' American Graffiti and the Indiana Jones franchise.\n\nPollock later transitioned to become a studio executive and producer. He was named executive vp of MCA Inc. and chairman of Universal Pictures in 1986, where he oversaw the release of box office successes including Jurassic Park, Schindler's List, Field of Dreams and the Back to the Future trilogy.\n\nSpike Lee also has given Pollock credit for not only greenlighting but also standing behind what would become his 1989 masterpiece, Do the Right Thing. Lee told The Hollywood Reporter in a 2019 interview that Pollock didn't back down when Universal was being pressured not to release the film, or at least push its release back out of the summer months, amid fears of racial unrest.\n\nPeter Green\n\nPeter Green, the dexterous blues guitarist who led the first incarnation of Fleetwood Mac in a career shortened by psychedelic drugs and mental illness, died July 25 at 73. A law firm representing his family, Swan Turton, announced the death in a statement Saturday. It said he died “peacefully in his sleep.\"\n\nGreen, to some listeners, was the best of the British blues guitarists of the 1960s. B.B. King once said Green “has the sweetest tone I ever heard. He was the only one who gave me the cold sweats.” Green also made a mark as a composer with “Albatross,” and as a songwriter with “Oh Well” and “Black Magic Woman.”\n\nHe crashed out of the band in 1971. Even so, Mick Fleetwood said in an interview with The Associated Press in 2017 that Green deserves the lion’s share of the credit for the band’s success. “Peter was asked why did he call the band Fleetwood Mac. He said, ‘Well, you know I thought maybe I’d move on at some point and I wanted Mick and John (McVie) to have a band.’ End of story, explaining how generous he was,” said Fleetwood, who described Green as a standout in an era of great guitar work.\n\nJim Lehrer\n\nJim Lehrer, the unflashy and never fashionable anchorman who delivered the news to public television audiences for 36 years before his retirement in 2011, died Jan. 23 at 85.\n\n\"I'm heartbroken at the loss of someone who was central to my professional life, a mentor to me and someone whose friendship I've cherished for decades,\" said PBS NewsHour anchor Judy Woodruff. \"I've looked up to him as the standard for fair, probing and thoughtful journalism, and I know countless others who feel the same way.\"\n\nLehrer moved to Washington in the early 1970s to become the public affairs coordinator at PBS and a correspondent for the National Public Affairs Center for Television. It was there that he met MacNeil and would soon begin one of the most esteemed partnerships in broadcast journalism history. They first teamed up to cover the Senate Watergate hearings in 1973, and their live coverage earned them an Emmy. In 1976, the pair launched the half-hour The MacNeil/Lehrer Report, which Lehrer once joked \"was the worst title in the history of television.\" The show, which focused on long-form journalism, covering a single story at length and in depth, collected more than 30 awards, including a Peabody, a DuPont and several Emmys. The program in 1983 became The MacNeil/Lehrer NewsHour, the nation's first hourlong evening news program. In 2009, the show's name changed to PBS NewsHour as Lehrer considered retirement, and he left the program as a regular contributor in June 2011 after some 8,000 broadcasts.\n\nJohn Prine\n\nAmericana legend and revered singer-songwriter John Prine died from complications of COVID-19 on April 7. He was 73. The Illinois-born Prine was the songwriter’s songwriter, getting his start in the Chicago folk scene in the 1970s, where his early champions included Kris Kristofferson, Bob Dylan and \"Cowboy\" Jack Clement, the latter of whom convinced Prine to move to Nashville in March 1980. Kristofferson is often credited with discovering Prine and invited him onstage at his own show at New York’s Bitter End in 1971. Well-known for his story songs with vivid imagery, countless artists covered Prine’s songs, including Johnny Cash (“Sam Stone”), Bette Midler (“Hello in There”) and Bonnie Raitt (“Angel From Montgomery”), as well as Zac Brown Band (“All the Best”), Miranda Lambert (“That’s the Way the World Goes Round”) and George Strait (“I Just Want to Dance With You”). He is also an uncredited co-writer on “You Never Even Call Me by My Name,” made famous by David Allan Coe and recorded by countless others.Prine placed 15 albums on the Billboard 200 chart since his self-titled debut arrived in February 1971. His two most recent works, though, earned key career milestones: 2016’s For Better, or Worse, an album of duets featuring classic country songs, marked the veteran’s first top 40 success on the chart, while The Tree of Forgiveness secured his first top 10 album, reaching No. 5 in 2018.\n\nTim Brooke-Taylor\n\nTim Brooke-Taylor, one of the trio of stars from the classic U.K. sketch show The Goodies, died on April 12. He was 79. The Goodies, a popular sketch show starring and co-written by Brooke-Taylor, Garden and Oddie, ran nine seasons on the BBC from 1970-1980. Brooke-Taylor was also known for his work on the long-running U.K. game show I'm Sorry I Haven't a Clue. He also appeared in various sitcoms. Brooke-Taylor received an Order of the British Empire for his body of work in 2011. Monty Python troupe member Eric Idle was among those paying their condolences to a comic much loved in Britain, tweeting that Brooke-Taylor had actually auditioned him at the very start of his career. Fellow Goodies star Graeme Garden told the BBC he was \"terribly saddened by the loss of a dear colleague and close friend of over 50 years.\" The Goodies' third star, Bill Oddie, said via Twitter: \"Fifty years and he only got cross with me once… well maybe twice… no quite a lot actually! No one could wear silly costumes or do dangerous stunts like Tim. I know it hurt cos he used to cry a lot. Sorry Timbo. A true visual comic and a great friend x.\"\n\nTerry Jones\n\nTerry Jones, a founding member of Monty Python and a beloved comedian, screenwriter, film director, poet, historian and author, died Jan. 21 at 77.\n\nJones had been suffering from dementia, which was revealed publicly by his son, Bill, in September 2016. It left him unable to speak. \"We are deeply saddened to have to announce the passing of beloved husband and father, Terry Jones,\" his family said in a statement. \"Terry passed away on the evening of 21 January 2020 at the age of 77 with his wife Anna Soderstrom by his side after a long, extremely brave but always good humoured battle with a rare form of dementia, FTD. Over the past few days his wife, children, extended family and many close friends have been constantly with Terry as he gently slipped away at his home in North London. We have all lost a kind, funny, warm, creative and truly loving man whose uncompromising individuality, relentless intellect and extraordinary humour has given pleasure to countless millions across six decades.\"\n\nAlthough rarely receiving the same acclaim as Monty Python's other members, Jones as widely regarded within the group as its underrated but passionate heart, known for his good-natured enthusiasm and a deep well of intelligence across a broad range of subjects.\n\nBuck Henry\n\nBuck Henry, the impish screenwriter whose wry, satirical sensibility brought comic electricity to The Graduate, What’s Up, Doc?, To Die For and TV’s Get Smartdied at the age of 89 of a heart attack on Jan. 8. Henry was a two-time Oscar nominee who often appeared onscreen — perhaps most memorably as a 10-time host (all in the show’s first four years) on Saturday Night Live. What’s Up, Doc? grossed $66 million ($374 million in today’s dollars) in the U.S. and Canada, trailing only The Godfather and The Poseidon Adventure that year. Henry adapted Joyce Maynard’s 1992 book, which was based on an actual New England murder case, for the Gus Van Sant black comedy To Die For (1995), with Nicole Kidman as an icy TV weathergirl who’ll stop at nothing to get ahead. Henry also wrote for the Nichols films Catch-22 (1970), adapted from the Joseph Heller novel, and the drama The Day of the Dolphin (1973); Candy (1968), adapted from the Terry Southern book; The Owl and the Pussycat (1970), with Streisand and his pal Segal; First Family (1980), starring Bob Newhart as the president, Madeline Kahn as the first lady and Gilda Radner as their daughter (he directed that one as well); Protocol (1984), topped by Goldie Hawn; and Town & Country (2001), starring Beatty. For TV, Henry also created the 1967 NBC comedy Captain Nice, centered on a mild-mannered guy (William Daniels) who becomes a superhero, and the late ’70s NBC sci-fi spoof Quark, which starred Richard Benjamin. Both series were short-lived. As an actor, Henry was memorable in Milos Forman’s Taking Off (1971) as a father seeking the whereabouts of his runaway daughter; in Catch-22 as Lt. Col. Korn; and in Nicolas Roeg’s The Man Who Fell to Earth (1976) as David Bowie’s business partner.\n\nDavid Stern\n\nDavid Stern, the basketball-loving lawyer who took the NBA around the world during 30 years as its longest-serving commissioner and oversaw its growth into a global powerhouse, died Jan. 1 at the age of 77. Stern suffered a brain hemorrhage on Dec. 12 and underwent emergency surgery. The league said he died with his wife, Dianne, and their family at his bedside. Stern had been involved with the NBA for nearly two decades before he became its fourth commissioner on Feb. 1, 1984. Thriving on good debate in the boardroom and good games in the arena, Stern would say one of his greatest achievements was guiding a league of mostly black players that was plagued by drug problems in the 1970s to popularity with mainstream America. He had a hand in nearly every initiative to do that, from the drug testing program, to the implementation of the salary cap, to the creation of a dress code. Stern oversaw the birth of seven new franchises and the creation of the WNBA and NBA Development League, now the G League, providing countless opportunities to pursue careers playing basketball in the U.S. that previously weren't available. After leaving office, Stern stayed busy, taking trips overseas on the league's behalf, doing public speaking and consulting various companies. He was inducted to the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame in 2014.\n\nStan Kirsch\n\nStan Kirsch, the actor best known for playing Richie Ryan on the '90s TV series Highlander, died on Jan. 11 due to apparent suicide, according to the Los Angeles County coroner. He was 51. Law enforcement sources told TMZ that Kirsch's wife, Kristyn Green, found the actor in their L.A. home. In her own Facebook post, Green wrote: \"I want to thank everyone for the outpouring of love and support. I haven’t been able to respond to all the texts, calls, emails – but have read or listened to every single one of them. I feel surrounded by love and am forever grateful to each and every one of you.\" And in a statement, also posted on Facebook, the team behind Highlander paid tribute to Kirsch and his contributions to the show: \"Without Stan Kirsch, Highlander: The Series would have been far less. He brought a sense of humor, kindness and youthful enthusiasm to the character of Richie Ryan for six seasons. Every time we had the opportunity to catch up with Stan, he was nothing but kind, thoughtful and sincere. He was a warm presence that will be missed.\" Kirsch, who ran an acting studio in L.A. with his wife, also appeared in a string of other shows including JAG, Invincible and Friends.\n\nSue Bruce-Smith\n\nSue Bruce-Smith, Film4's deputy director and a much-loved and highly respected figure in the British film industry, died on May 2. She was 62. Bruce-Smith spent two decades of her career at Film4, first joining the organization in 1997 after stints at the BFI’s production division, BBC Worldwide and Palace Pictures. In 2001, Bruce-Smith relocated with her family to Dublin and joined independent producer Little Bird. But she was lured back to Film4 by Tessa Ross in 2004 and had remained there ever since. Over the years, she developed close working relationships with rising filmmakers now considered to be among the very best, including Steve McQueen, working with the director on every feature of his, right from his debut Hunger to his Oscar-winning 12 Years a Slave and latest feature, Widows. At the U.K. premiere of Widows in London in 2018, McQueen gave a shout-out to Bruce-Smith in the audience, saying, \"This screening is for you, Sue.\" Bruce-Smith also applied her expertise to all three of Yorgos Lanthimos' features with Film4 — The Lobster, The Killing of a Sacred Deer and The Favourite — and four titles from Ben Wheatley, from 2011's Kill List to 2015's High Rise. Her final credit was the Toronto International Film Festival-bowing Rocks, her second effort with director Sarah Gavin, having worked on the filmmaker's previous feature, Suffragette. Last year, BAFTA celebrated Bruce-Smith's career with a special tribute event to reflect on her outstanding contribution to the industry, at which a wide range of filmmakers she’d helped demonstrated their love and respect for her.\n\nCaroline Flack\n\nCaroline Flack, former host of U.K.'s Love Island, died Feb. 15. Her death was confirmed by her family in a statement via the Press Association on Saturday. She was 40. \"We can confirm that our Caroline passed away today on the 15th February,\" the statement began. \"We would ask that the press respect the privacy of the family at this difficult time.\" While no cause of death was given, multiple reports in British news outlets noted that Flack was found unresponsive at her apartment in London. She began her career on the comedy series Bo' Selecta! in 2002 and went on to present shows on the ITV network such as The Xtra Factor. Flack began presenting the dating reality series Love Island in 2015, for which she became well known. The show follows a group of young men and women living in a Spanish villa together and hoping to find romantic connections. In a statement obtained by The Hollywood Reporter, an ITV spokesperson said, \"Everybody at Love Island and ITV is shocked and saddened by this desperately sad news. Caroline was a much loved member of the Love Island team and our sincere thoughts and condolences are with her family and friends.\" Flack stepped down from the series in 2019 following a domestic assault charge involving her partner, tennis player Lewis Burton. She was replaced by Irish TV host Laura Whitmore. On social media, Whitmore was one of many Love Island castmembers who took to Twitter to share their grief over Flack's death. She posted a picture of herself with Flack and wrote, \"I'm trying to find the words but I can't.\" Beside it, she included a poem about losing a loved one. In the coming days, Flack was due to face trial for the alleged assault of her boyfriend. Burton broke his silence about her death in an Instagram post Sunday, saying he was \"so lost for words\" about her passing. \"My heart is broken,\" Burton wrote, alongside a photo of himself and Flack. \"We had something so special. I am so lost for words I am in so much pain I miss you so much I know you felt safe with me you always said I don't think about anything else when I am with you and I was not allowed to be there this time I kept asking and asking.\" He added: \"I will be your voice baby I promise I will ask all the questions you wanted and I will get all the answers nothing will bring you back but I will try make you proud everyday. I love you with all my heart.\" Flack was born in 1979 in London. Among her additional TV credits, she had guest appearances in Celebrity Juice, Britain's Got More Talent, Loose Women, Sunday Brunch and Strictly Come Dancing. The death of Flack comes a year and a half after season two Love Island contestant Sophie Gradon killed herself at her family home after mixing alcohol and cocaine and 10 months after season three contestant Mike Thalassitis died, again by committing suicide. Following Flack's death, an ITV spokesperson said Love Island would not air on Sunday. \"After careful consultation between Caroline's representatives and the Love Island production team and given how close we still are to the news of Caroline's tragic death, we have decided not to broadcast tonight's Love Island out of respect for Caroline's family. Love Island will return tomorrow night which will include a tribute to Caroline who will be forever in our hearts.\"\n\nLogan Williams\n\nLogan Williams, who played a young Barry Allen on the CW's The Flash, died April 2 according to multiple reports. He was 16. A rep for Williams could not immediately be reached for more information, but according to Canada's Tri-City News, his mother, Marlyse Williams, said Friday she is \"absolutely devastated\" over his death. No cause of death was revealed. Grant Gustin, who plays the adult Allen on the CW series, also shared news of Williams' death Friday by posting a photo of the young actor with Jesse L. Martin during the filming of the series pilot in 2014. \"I was so impressed by not only Logan’s talent, but his professionalism on set. My thoughts and prayers will be with him and his family during what is I’m sure an unimaginably difficult time for them. Please keep Logan and his family in your thoughts and prayers during what has been a strange and trying time for us all. Sending love to everyone,\" Gustin wrote in the post. The Canada native played a youthful Allen for eight episodes of the CW series. He last appeared in the second season's episode \"The Man Who Saved Central City.\" His other credits include starring in Hallmark's When Calls the Heart as Miles Montgomery and Max Johnson on Supernatural.\n\nTerrence McNally\n\nTerrence McNally, the admired playwright and librettist who received five Tony Awards while bringing his perspective on the world to such productions as Kiss of the Spider-Woman, Master Class, Ragtime and Love! Valour! Compassion! died March 24 at a hospital in Sarasota, Florida, due to complications from coronavirus, publicist Matt Polk told The Hollywood Reporter. He was 81. McNally battled lung cancer since the late 1990s, and the disease cost him portions of both lungs. He had lived with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ever since. With 25 Broadway productions, nearly 40 plays and 10 musicals, McNally was a prolific writer whose work moved seamlessly from comedy to drama and from downtown avant-garde to the mainstream Great White Way. McNally won his first Tony in 1993 for his book for the musical Kiss of the Spider Woman and followed with trophies for Love! Valour! Compassion! (best play) in '95, Master Class (best play) in '96 and Ragtime (best book of a musical) in '98. His first break into the mainstream came in 1987 with his off-Broadway hit Frankie and Johnny in the Clair de Lune, a play about a one-night stand starring Abraham and Kathy Bates. (A longtime drunk, McNally said it was the first play he had written sober.) He also did the screenplay for Garry Marshall's 1991 film adaptation that starred Al Pacino and Michelle Pfeiffer. The play was revived on Broadway in 2002 with Edie Falco and Stanley Tucci, and again in 2019 starring McDonald and Michael Shannon in what would be the final Broadway production of McNally's work in his lifetime."
