RYAN’S DAUGHTER\n\n(1970, Written by Robert Bolt)\n\nI recently saw Ryan’s Daughter again, for the first time in many years, and – appropriately enough for a film in which a huge Atlantic storm is the centre-piece – I was blown away. It is a truly magnificent film and one of the few great cinematic tragedies to match the many great tragedies of drama and literature.\n\nInitially, Ryan’s Daughter was supposed to be an adaptation of Gustav Flaubert’s classic novel, Madam Bovary. However, after Robert Bolt (who succeeded, and eventually eclipsed, Noël Coward as Lean’s literary collaborator) produced a script placed in the novel’s original setting of 19th century France, Lean argued for its transposition to early 20th century Ireland, specifically the West of Ireland during World War One. It was a move of genius, adding enormous contemporary resonance to what might otherwise have seemed a historically distant period piece. Indeed, the move may have been too successful. The muted critical reaction to Ryan’s Daughter at the time of its release, especially in Britain, may have been due in part to the fact that it arguably adopted a pro-Irish independence slant at a time when the Troubles in Northern Ireland were erupting and the whole issue of Ireland’s relationship to Britain was becoming troublingly, indeed terrifyingly, contemporary.\n\n45 years on, and with Northern Ireland infinitely more peaceful than at the time of the film’s release, it is possible to judge Ryan’s Daughter on its own huge merits. The script is typically Bolt-ian (i.e. simultaneously literary and cinematic); the cinematography is sublime (Lean’s cinematographer on Ryan, Freddie Young, equalled Guy Green nearly a quarter of a century earlier and won an Oscar for Best Cinematography); and the acting is arguably as good as that in any major film of the last 50 years. John Mills, as the “village idiot” Michael (for which he won the film’s second Oscar as Best Supporting Actor); Trevor Howard as the ultra-religious but supremely human local priest; Robert Mitchum as the cuckolded husband (in what may be the best ever “against-type” performance by a major Hollywood star); Leo McKern as the treacherous Ryan, who condemns his own daughter to public vilification to save his own skin (entirely credibly, given that a man would have been executed for treason whereas a young woman is simply “scalped”); and Sarah Miles, as the titular heroine, and Christopher Jones, as her British army officer lover, are all absolutely superb.\n\nAnd then there is the ending, which is often unfairly overlooked in accounts of the greatest endings, and in particular the greatest last lines, of any film. After the incredible events of Ryan’s Daughter, Mitchum and Miles resolve to leave the village and the villagers who have condemned them, planning to part from each other only after they are have left, as they do not want to give the villagers the satisfaction of knowing that their marriage has failed. Suspecting that that is their plan, Trevor Howard says that he “doubts” that they will be better off apart. Then, literally shoving Mitchum into the bus that will take him and his unfaithful wife away, he declares, “That doubt is my parting gift to you”. It is a wonderfully lyrical, nuanced last line, entirely in keeping with a wonderfully lyrical, nuanced film."
