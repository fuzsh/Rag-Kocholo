        "text": "Director Ron Howard’s latest film, Eden, has officially wrapped filming. The Academy Award-winning filmmaker shared the news on his Instagram account, thanking the cast and crew for making the “challenging” project a “gratifying” journey.\n\n“That’s a wrap on Eden, our latest project. It was a challenging one, but our tremendous cast and crew made it a gratifying and even thrilling creative journey,” the director wrote.\n\nThe survival thriller, which is billed as Howard’s passion project, started production in Australia. No release date has been set yet for Eden, but there are plans to release the feature later this year.\n\nWhat is Eden about?\n\nOriginally under the title Origin of Species, Eden — based on a screenplay Howard co-wrote with Noah Pink — is a project the director has been trying to develop for more than a decade. It will tell a true story about an unresolved mystery in a remote area of the Galápagos Islands, drawing inspiration from two different accounts of the same incident.\n\nAccording to the producers, Eden will explore “the human condition in ways that are unexpected, absurd, humorous, sexy, but above all thrilling and deeply suspenseful.” The film is produced by Bill Connor, Patrick Newall, Imagine Entertainment’s Brian Grazer and Karen Lunder, and AGC Studios’ Stuart Ford.\n\nIn addition to directing and writing the upcoming film, Howard also served as the producer. He also reunited with longtime collaborator Hans Zimmer for the movie.\n\nEden boasts a star-studded cast\n\nVanessa Kirby (Napoleon) and Sydney Sweeney (Anyone but You) had previously been tapped to replace Alicia Vikander and Daisy Edgar-Jones in the movie. They will join previously announced cast members, including BAFTA-nominated actor Daniel Bruhl (All Quiet on the Western Front) and Oscar nominees Jude Law (The Talented Mr. Ripley) and Ana de Armas (Knives Out).\n\nOther details about Eden remain under wraps, and it has yet to release a trailer and/or announce an exact release window."
