        "text": "Post by iheartamyadams on\n\nGlenn Close is rumored for this as well per Jeff Snieder, but no confirmation on that yet.\n\nAmy Adams to Star in Ron Howard’s ‘Hillbilly Elegy’ at Netflix (EXCLUSIVE)\n\nAmy Adams is set to star in Netflix’s adaptation of “Hilllbilly Elegy,” that Ron Howard is on board to direct, Variety has learned.\n\n“Shape of Water” screenwriter Vanessa Taylor adapted the script with Brian Grazer, Howard and Karen Lunder producing for Imagine Entertainment. Julie Oh and J.D. Vance will exec produce.\n\nBased on on the bestselling memoir by J.D. Vance, the pic is a modern exploration of the American Dream and follows three generations of an Appalachian family as told by its youngest member, a Yale Law student forced to return to his hometown.\n\n———\n\nEXCLUSIVE: Netflix has come out on top in a red-hot auction for the film version of J.D. Vance’s lauded bestseller Hillbilly Elegy, which Ron Howard is directing and The Shape Of Water co-writer Vanessa Taylor is adapting.\n\nNetflix will fully finance the pic to the tune of $45M. There were multiple high net worth backers in the mix and many other admirers but Netflix’s offer blew rivals away, I understand. By almost double. Not all of the $45M will go on production. A fair whack of that will go on fees. I gather there is a theatrical allowance here which could see the release potentially play out Roma-style. CAA brokered the pact, which is not part of this week’s Sundance deal-making.\n\nHoward is directing and producing with his Imagine Entertainment partner Brian Grazer and the company’s Karen Lunder. Julie Oh is exec producer. The idea is to shoot later this year but cast has yet to be set.\n\nImagine won the book rights in another heated auction back in 2017. Vance’s memoir (Hillbilly Elegy: A Memoir of a Family and Culture in Crisis, to give it its full title), a bestseller for 74 weeks, is a critically revered account of growing up in the Rust Belt and a personal analysis of the white underclass, race and privilege in America. Vance, raised poor among working-class “hillbillies,” explores his childhood and family struggles as they navigate drug addiction, and social and economic challenges. Supported by his larger-than-life grandmother, he developed a deep appreciation for education that laid the foundation for him to rise out of poverty and its cultural restraints. The film has inevitably become a passion project for Howard and it is rounding into good shape now.\n\ndeadline.com/2019/01/netflix-hillbilly-elegy-ron-howard-movie-deal-40m-1202541118\n\nPost by morton on\n\nI know Ron Howard probably isn't one of the most liked directors here, but I think this could be good depending on the script of course. Like I really enjoyed Solo, maybe one of the few people that did, but I think that the problems were mostly in the screenplay, and that Howard did a fine job considering he had to come in and reshoot the whole film basically.\n\nI know someone is going to say it, so I might as well put it out there. Could this be the project that finally wins Adams and Close their Oscars?\n\nPost by Deleted on\n\n@tyler said:\n\nMaybe her career trajectory really will follow Geraldine Page's now... Hollywood clearly needed reminding of this national treasure.\n\nIt definitely helps, and from all accounts the role is baity, and the veteran narrative helps in supporting categories far more often than it does in lead. But it will all depend on the competition and the quality of the movie itself. But it is Ron Howard, who makes relatively safe films that have broad appeal, so that works in her favor.\n\nNot necessarily in terms of winning an Oscar (I still don't think that will happen, unfortunately) - more in that she'll continue to be cast in plum roles moving forward. It seems that Hollywood only needed to be reminded of her gifts.\n\nPost by iheartamyadams on\n\nPutting two of most numerically overdue actresses in the same film, giving each what is arguably their most baity roles, in a film that if structured like the book would see both in Supporting... I’m convinced that Ron Howard is trying to break the internet lol\n\nGlenn easily wins in this case unless she doesn’t deliver as she’s a vet, has been closer to winning and been in the industry a lot longer. No doubt about that. She’s doing everything right and making good on the exposure almost winning provided. Hopefully one runs lead so they don’t compete against each other.\n\nI’m getting A:OC vibes from this. Two powerhouses elevating an average film is about what I’m expecting from this. And who knows how far those two would’ve made it if they had due narratives? Interested to see who is cast as the male lead... without knowing all that much about the book, I’ll go against the obvious Lucas Hedges/Timothee Chamalet suggestions and suggest Tye Sheridan.\n\nPost by Leo_The_Last on\n\nYeah, I was criticizing pupdurcs on the Macbeth thread about the inevitability of incoming Oscars, but, just to contradict myself, this sounds like it could lead to that eventual Oscar for Close (or Adams), especially if/because it's a baity supporting part.\n\nRon Howard gets too much hate around internet blogs. He's no Altman or Lynch, but more than a solid craftsman that used to be the backbone of the golden age of Hollywood.\n\nThere was much talk about this book here in Europe also, like it was the key to understand the Trump phenomenon etc., which I think is mostly bullshit. They made it look like every working class family looks like the one described in the book, pfhhd, bullshit. This sounds more like a Winter's Bone milieu. No idea how big the part of the kid/boy is going to be, now that they already have two big name actresses attached, maybe they could go with a more unknown, less established lead (like Lawrence in 'Bone', probably still her finest work).\n\nPost by pupdurcs on\n\nYeah, I was criticizing pupdurcs on the Macbeth thread about the inevitability of incoming Oscars, but, just to contradict myself, this sounds like it could lead to that eventual Oscar for Close (or Adams), especially if/because it's a baity supporting part.\n\nRon Howard gets too much hate around internet blogs.

And Close especially is such a martyr at this point, that a strong supporting push might make her undeniable (this is why people were silly to criticise Viola Davis for going supporting in Fences. Lead can be harder to convert to a win, wheras supporting often has processions or career wins, depending on the level of competition. Davis didn't let herself become another Glenn Close).\n\nHoward hasn't had much love from the Academy recently, but he is a very solid pair of hands. Not flashy, but a pro. I can see this delivering acting nods, and maybe finally a win for Close.\n\nPost by stephen on\n\nYa goddamn hypocrite!\n\nIt's alright, I forgive you\n\nThe \"stars\" and their perceived overdueness certainly makes Oscar talk very credible.

Davis didn't let herself become another Glenn Close).\n\nHoward hasn't had much love from the Academy recently, but he is a very solid pair of hands. Not flashy, but a pro. I can see this delivering acting nods, and maybe finally a win for Close.\n\nNot to mention that Viola Davis actually is supporting in the film. If she's lead, so is Jovan Adepo, as their relationships bear the same amount of weight in the film version of the play. I've heard that the actual Tony-winning performance emphasizes Rose a bit more than the film does, by virtue of the stage format, but if we're taking the film version on its own, she's most definitely supporting.\n\nPost by iheartamyadams on\n\nYeah, Davis is Supporting in Fences. Being a quasi lead didn’t work out for her in The Help, so it’s complety understandable that she’d want to go Supporting that time around and secure the win. The backlash she received over that choice was a bit much... I get that people want to see another Black best Actress winner, but that part wasn’t overly baity and it was a tough year for Best Actress. There’s a strong chance she would’ve faced the same fate imo.\n\nGlenn will probably win in Supporting, and there’s no shame in that. She’s 71 years old.. that she’s even still in Oscar conversations on a somewhat frequent basis and getting roles that Meryl Streep would’ve easily been first choice for five years ago is remarkable in itself. I thought she was headed towards O’Toole status immediately after the recent loss, but it appears to have upped the sympathy factor to an undeniable degree. And it also sort of introduced her (and her narrative) to a younger generation who is probably unfamiliar with her peak years. Her film career has been completely unremarkable for so long that she didn’t have melinnial support that someone like Julianne Moore had during her Still Alice run."
