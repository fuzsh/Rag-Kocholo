With a lifelong interest in TV and movie production, it didn't take much to twist my arm, and I wasn't disappointed. You might be wondering why I would post about that here on Linkedin. It's because, as a Director (aka Leader), he had some really interesting things to say about how he navigates the balance between taking creative input ðŸ’¡ from his team and sticking with his own ideas. He talked about: âœ… Recognising that if, some of the time, you say 'yes' to new ideas from the team, they will trust you at the times you feel compelled to say 'no', and ðŸ”Ž Always trying to stay focused on the objective - and not his own idea of how it should be realised. That makes it easier to stay open to new ideas. Some great ideas there. If you decide to listen, I'd love to know what else you took away from the conversation."
