        "text": "Carrie Fisher is given an \"amazing\" send-off in her final Star Wars film, according to co-star John Boyega.\n\nThe London-born actor said he shares \"many scenes\" with the late actress in Star Wars: The Last Jedi and that the sci-fi franchise \"keeps her alive\".\n\nFisher, who played the part of Princess - later General - Leia, died last December aged 60.\n\nHer final film performance will be seen when the latest Star Wars blockbuster is released at the end of the year.\n\nBoyega was with family in Nigeria when he found out about Fisher's death, which came four days after she was taken ill on a flight from London to Los Angeles.\n\n\"It was a strange, strange feeling,\" said the 25-year-old, currently promoting his role in race drama Detroit.\n\n\"I felt like everybody in the cast and obviously around the world [and] went silent for a bit.\"\n\nHis comments came as Fisher's actress daughter, Billie Lourd, spoke about the last time she saw her mother.\n\n\"The last time I saw her in person, this episode of Scream Queens was on, and it was a big episode for me,\" she told fellow actress Sarah Paulson in Town & Country magazine, external.\n\n\"I had tons of scenes, and I was so hard on myself about it - I hated how I looked, hated my performance. I was really frustrated.\n\n\"She told me, 'Come over right now. I want to watch this with you.' And she made me sit down and watch it, and she forced me to see the good parts.\n\n\"She was incredible like that. But she was really hard on me, saying, 'Shut up, you're great in this. Have faith in yourself. Be more confident.\"'\n\nLourd lost her grandmother Debbie Reynolds the day after her mother's death and admitted she had always \"lived in their shadows\".\n\n\"I love being my mother's daughter, and it's something I always will be, but now I get to be just Billie,\" she added."
