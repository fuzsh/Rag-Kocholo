I also enjoy hackathons and adventures around the world.\n\nRonald Howard (British actor)\n\nShare on FacebookTweet on TwitterShare on LinkedInShare on Reddit\n\nSign in\n\nRonald Howard (7 April 1918 – 19 December 1996) was an English actor and writer best known in the U.S. for starring in a weekly Sherlock Holmes television series in 1954. He was the son of actor Leslie Howard.\n\nContents\n\nEarly life\n\nFilm career\n\nIn Search of My Father\n\nFilmography\n\nReferences\n\nEarly life\n\nHoward was born in South Norwood, London, the son of Ruth Evelyn (née Martin) and stage and screen actor Leslie Howard. He attended Tonbridge School. After graduating from Jesus College, Cambridge, Ronald Howard became a newspaper reporter for a while but decided to become an actor.\n\nFilm career\n\nHis first film role was an uncredited bit part in Pimpernel Smith (1941), a film directed by and starring his father in the title role, though young Howard's part ended up on the cutting room floor. In the early 1940s, Howard gained acting experience in regional theatre, the London stage and eventually films, his official debut in While the Sun Shines in 1947. Howard received varying degrees of exposure in some well-known films, such as The Queen of Spades (1949) and The Browning Version (1951). Howard played Will Scarlet in the episode of the same name of the 1950s British television classic The Adventures of Robin Hood starring Richard Greene. The character of Scarlet was later portrayed by Paul Eddington.\n\nThe 1954 Sherlock Holmes television series, based on the Arthur Conan Doyle characters and produced by Sheldon Reynolds, ran for 39 episodes starring Howard as Holmes and Howard Marion-Crawford as Watson. In addition to 21st century DVD releases, in 2006 and 2014 this series was broadcast in the UK on the satellite channel Bonanza.\n\nHoward continued mainly in British \"B\" films throughout the 1950s and '60s, most notably The Curse of the Mummy's Tomb (1964), along with a few plum television guest roles in British and American television in the 1960s, including the TV series, Combat! s.2 ep.25: \"What Are the Bugles Blowin' For?\" - Pt.1 & 2 (1964) Wing Commander Hayes in the 1967 Cowboy in Africa TV show with Chuck Connors and Tom Nardini; 1961 episode of Boris Karloff's TV series Thriller, S2 E5 God Grante that she Lye Stille. Of his career in British B films the film historians Steve Chibnall and Brian McFarlane say: \"Despite his blond good looks (and resemblance to his father) and his agreeable demeanour, he lacked genuine star quality.\"\n\nIn the mid-1970s, he reluctantly put aside his acting career to run an art gallery.\n\nIn Search of My Father\n\nIn the 1980s he wrote In Search of My Father: A Portrait of Leslie Howard, a biography covering the career and mysterious death of his father, whose plane was shot down over the Bay of Biscay on 1 June 1943. His conclusion (which remains in dispute) was that the Germans' goal in shooting down the plane was to kill his father, who had been travelling through Spain and Portugal, ostensibly lecturing on film, but also meeting with local propagandists and shoring up support for the Allied cause.\n\nThe Germans suspected surreptitious activities since German agents were active throughout Spain and Portugal, which, like Switzerland, was a crossroads for persons from both sides of the conflict, but even more accessible to Allied citizens.\n\nThe book explores in detail written German orders to the Ju 88 Staffel based in France, assigned to intercept the aircraft, as well as communiqués on the British side that verify intelligence reports of the time indicating a deliberate attack on Howard. Howard was convinced that the order to shoot down the airliner came directly from Joseph Goebbels, the Nazi Minister of Propaganda, who had been ridiculed in one of Howard's films, and who believed Howard to be the most dangerous British propagandist.\n\nFilmography\n\nActor\n\n1975\n\nTake a Hard Ride as\n\nHalsey\n\n1974\n\nPersecution as\n\nDr. Ross\n\n1973\n\nThe Lotus Eaters (TV Series) as\n\nDr. John Dartington\n\n- And If You Have the Time, Lord (1973) - Dr. John Dartington\n\n- The Well Diggers (1973) - Dr. John Dartington\n\n- Beside a Crooked Stile (1973) - Dr. John Dartington\n\n- A Very Long Spoon (1973) - Dr. John Dartington\n\n- A Kind of Treason (1973) - Dr. John Dartington\n\n1971\n\nThe Hunting Party as\n\nWatt Nelson\n\n1969\n\nRun a Crooked Mile (TV Movie) as\n\nInspector Huntington\n\n1968\n\nKoroshi (TV Movie) as\n\nSanders\n\n1967\n\nCowboy in Africa (TV Series) as\n\nWing Commander Hayes\n\n- The Kasubi Death (1968) - Wing Commander Hayes\n\n- The Lions (1968) - Wing Commander Hayes\n\n- John Henry's Eden (1968) - Wing Commander Hayes\n\n- Work of Art (1968) - Wing Commander Hayes\n\n- Search and Destroy (1968) - Wing Commander Hayes\n\n- A Man of Value (1968) - Wing Commander Hayes\n\n- The Quiet Death (1968) - Wing Commander Hayes\n\n- The Red Hand of Michael O'Neill (1968) - Wing Commander Hayes\n\n- First to Capture (1968) - Wing Commander Hayes\n\n- African Rodeo: Part 2 (1968) - Wing Commander Hayes\n\n- African Rodeo: Part 1 (1968) - Wing Commander Hayes\n\n- The Hesitant Hero (1967) - Wing Commander Hayes\n\n- To Build a Beginning (1967) - Wing Commander Hayes\n\n- The Man Who Has Everything (1967) - Wing Commander Hayes\n\n- Little Boy Lost (1967) - Wing Commander Hayes\n\n- Tomorrow on the Wind (1967) - Wing Commander Hayes\n\n- Lake Sinclair (1967) - Wing Commander Hayes\n\n- The Time of the Predator (1967) - Wing Commander Hayes\n\n- Fang and Claw (1967) - Wing Commander Hayes\n\n- The Adopted One (1967) - Wing Commander Hayes\n\n- Stone Age Safari (1967) - Wing Commander Hayes\n\n- Search for Survival (1967) - Wing Commander Hayes\n\n- What's an Elephant Mother to Do?
