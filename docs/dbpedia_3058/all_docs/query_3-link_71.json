        "text": "In one scene in Ron Howard's forthcoming movie, ''edTV,'' a loutish character played by Woody Harrelson stands in front of a television camera and delightedly discloses that his sister is dating a man who plays the piano so badly that during a gig at a bar his head was cracked open by someone throwing the tip glass. More, he blabbers, how funny that the couple met in a bar, because his sister is an alcoholic. Hah-hah!\n\nThe movie is about a family made famous when it agrees to have its life broadcast 24 hours a day, and Ron Howard (above) wants us to understand that celebrity does strange things to people.\n\nIt has been nine years since Mr. Howard, the director and producer, created what had been his signature, a comedy. His last comic effort was ''Parenthood,'' which was followed by dramas like ''Apollo 13'' and ''Ransom.''\n\nNow he's back with ''edTV,'' which stars Matthew McConaughey, Mr. Harrelson, Jenna Elfman and Martin Landau, all part of or friends of the family, with the focus on one of the sons, Ed, who makes himself a television fixture. Unlike the character in ''The Truman Show,'' these slightly dysfunctional people invite the camera to observe, until their lives spin out of control. The film, produced by Mr. Howard's partner, Brian Grazer, is to open next spring and carries a new, somewhat personal edge for Mr. Howard.\n\nIt is not just a comedy; it has a serious point to make about how celebrity can twist people, an apt sentiment for a man who says he suffered under his early celebrity as a child actor and who has struggled to build himself a world of normalcy ever since. Mr. Howard lives in Westchester County in New York, not Los Angeles, and he said his four children go to public schools there.\n\nMr. Howard said he had been looking for a way to get back into comedy; he called ''edTV'' ''thoroughly unpretentious entertainment.'' Yet, he added, it offers an object lesson for a country obsessed with the idea that celebrity solves rather than creates problems.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
