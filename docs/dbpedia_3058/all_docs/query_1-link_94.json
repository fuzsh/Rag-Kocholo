        "text": "Sometimes they wrestle with issues of infirmity, impotence and mortality. Sometimes they steal cars, jump from trains, bust out of rest homes, make stuff explode and have more irresponsible sex than frat boys. Here’s a list of films that feature two or more mature stars and their often immature adventures.\n\nBest Exotic Marigold Hotel (2011): British retirees get duped by an Indian hotel that’s considerably less than advertised, but they gradually warm to its energetic and persuasive manager. There’s autumnal romance and death, nicely counterbalanced. It’s a slight film, but a great vehicle for some of Britain’s best veteran actors (Judi Dench, Tom Wilkinson, Maggie Smith, Bill Nighy, Penelope Wilton) to quietly make magic.\n\nThe Bucket List (2007): Jack Nicholson and Morgan Freeman play unlikely buddies, two terminally ill men from different worlds who decide to sow some last-minute wild oats. Despite the star power, the movie sinks under the implausibility of its premise. Roger Ebert hated it. “I urgently advise hospitals: Do not make the DVD available to your patients; there may be an outbreak of bedpans thrown at TV screens.”\n\nCocoon (1985): Director Ron Howard gathered an all-star list of silver hairs (Wilford Brimley, Hume Cronyn, Jack Gilford, Gwen Verdon, Maureen Stapleton, Jessica Tandy and Don Ameche, best supporting actor Oscar winner that year) for this endearing tale about a group that sneaks out of the retirement home at night to swim at a nearby residential pool, which suddenly acquires strange powers of rejuvenation. Best line: “Cat couldn’t scratch it.”\n\nGrumpy Old Men (1993): Two guys who’ve despised each other for decades (Jack Lemmon and Walter Matthau) ratchet up the feud when a hot, snowmobile-driving professor (Ann-Margret) moves into the neighborhood and they’re both smitten. The movie has its slow moments, but who doesn’t enjoy watching Lemmon and Matthau bust each other’s chops? Bonus oldsters: Burgess Meredith and Ossie Davis.\n\nLast Vegas (2013): Four longtime Flatbush friends (Michael Douglas, Robert De Niro, Morgan Freeman and Kevin Kline) decide to throw a Vegas bachelor party for Douglas’ character, the only one who’s still single. Simmering rivalries and lounge singer Diana Boyle (Mary Steenburgen) complicate matters. Huge laughs and unexpected plot twists help to blunt the aging-male clichés.\n\nMy Fellow Americans (1996): Two former Presidents from opposing parties who can’t stomach each other (James Garner and Jack Lemmon) are forced to work together to expose the current POTUS (Dan Aykroyd), who blames them for his scandals. Implausible? Hmmm. Garner and Lemmon are salty — these guys do some world-class swearing — and surprisingly touching. Garner’s light touch complements Lemmon’s sweaty angst nicely.\n\nQuartet (2012): A comfortable British home for retired musicians looks posh, but it’s in trouble and only a fundraiser starring a difficult diva will keep it open. Director Dustin Hoffman delivers a vehicle for older actors that’s predictable but sweet. The cast of senior talent is impressive: Maggie Smith, Tom Courtenay, Billy Connolly, Pauline Collins, Michael Gambon and more.\n\nRED (2010): A former CIA operative (Bruce Willis) assembles his old killing squad to help him out: Joe Matheson (Morgan Freeman), Marvin Boggs (John Malkovich), Victoria (Helen Mirren) and Ivan (Brian Cox). Disappointingly by-the-numbers and unconvincing, except for Mirren: She’s completely believable as a sexy, stone-cold assassin who can take a gut shot and seem chipper the next day. Bonus: Richard Dreyfuss plays a Cheney-like VP.\n\nSpace Cowboys (2000): An old Soviet satellite is falling toward Earth. An emergency mission can steer it back into orbit, but the computer code on board is so ancient only one man can understand it: aging flyboy Frank Corvin (Clint Eastwood). Everyone on his team and at NASA HQ, it seems, is ready for the glue factory: Tommy Lee Jones, Donald Sutherland, James Garner, James Cromwell. It’s predictable but charming, with enjoyable chemistry among the stars.\n\nStand Up Guys (2012): Two long-in-the-tooth wise guys, Val and Doc (Al Pacino and Christopher Walken) look up their old buddy Hirsch (Alan Arkin) and enjoy a wild night. Violence, mayhem and Viagra jokes arrive in short order. Noah Haidle’s script is only fitfully entertaining, but it’s got some wonderful lines. As Doc and Val are knocking over a drug store to prepare Val for a wild night, Doc pockets a vial of pills: “My co-pay is insane on that one!”\n\nThe Sunshine Boys (1975): An old vaudeville duo reunites for a TV special, but they’re bitter enemies now and curmudgeonly chaos results. With a Neil Simon script and two solid-gold stars (Walter Matthau and George Burns), the best moments make you forget about the lost opportunities in Simon’s story, which is better line to line than as a whole.\n\nThe Whales of August (1987): Sarah Webber (Lillian Gish) and her blind sister Libby Strong (Bette Davis) summer at their Maine cottage, as they’ve done for 60 years. Neighbors Mr. Maranov (Vincent Price) and Tisha Doughty (Anne Sothern) show up to gossip, fish and introduce ulterior motives. It’s worth seeing just for the silver-haired star power. Watch for old pro Harry Carey Jr. as an annoyingly chatty handyman."
