        "text": "Last Updated on March 16, 2024 by Scott Wampler\n\nDavid Gordon Green’s The Exorcist: Believer, the first film in what’s being planned an entirely new trilogy, hits theaters in just a matter of days, and you know what that means: it’s time for this film’s marketing campaign to kick into high gear. So far we’ve seen posters and TV spots and a smattering of trailers, but today Blumhouse and Universal have shared five new clips from Gordon Green’s film … and they are, unsurprisingly, kinda freaky.\n\nWe’ll get to those clips in just a moment, but first (and this next part is largely for anyone who’s been living under a rock for the past however-many months), let’s take another look at The Exorcist: Believer‘s official plot synopsis:\n\n“Since the death of his pregnant wife in a Haitian earthquake 12 years ago, Victor Fielding (Leslie Odom, Jr.) has raised their daughter Angela (Lidya Jewett) on his own. But when Angela and her friend Katherine (Olivia Marcum) disappear in the woods, only to return three days later with no memory of what happened, it unleashes a chain of events that will force Victor to confront the nadir of evil and, in his terror and desperation, seek out the only person alive who has witnessed anything like it before: Chris MacNeil (Ellen Burstyn).”\n\nEveryone on the same page? Good, let’s take a look at these clips:\n\nHere we have Leslie Odom Jr.’s Victor seeking guidance and a wee bit of help from Ellen Burstyn’s Chris MacNeil, who you’ll of course remember from the original The Exorcist.\n\nIn this clip, Chris MacNeil and Victor visit the hospital to see how Angela’s holding up. She is not holding up well, by the looks of things. Seems a bit possessed, if you ask us.\n\nHere, in a scene which presumably takes place before the second clip, Victor tucks Angela into bed … and Angela has a brief vision that calls to mind a particularly memorable scare from James Wan’s Insidious.\n\nNext up, Victor finds out the hard way that Angela’s a bit stronger than she looks.\n\nAnd, finally, in a scene that’s been front and center throughout The Exorcist: Believer‘s marketing campaign, Olivia Marcum’s Katherine – clearly in fully-possessed mode – attends church. It goes about as well as you’d expect."
