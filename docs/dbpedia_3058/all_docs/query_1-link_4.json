He has won the Academy Award for Best Actor in a Leading Role for his role as paraplegic Vietnam War veteran Luke Martin in the war film \"Coming Home\" (1978). He has also been nominated for the same award other two times. He was first nominated for his role as aspiring gigolo Joe Buck in \"Midnight Cowboy\" (1969), He was last nominated for the award for his role as escaped convict Oscar \"Manny\" Manheim in \"Runaway Train\" (1985). He was also nominated for the Academy Award for Best Actor in a Supporting Role, for his role as sports journalist Howard Cosell (1918-1995) in \"Ali\" (2001).\n\nIn 1938, Voight was born in Yonkers, New York. His parents were professional golfer Elmer Samuel Voight (original name Elem√≠r Vojtka) and his wife Barbara Agnes (Kamp). His paternal grandfather was a Slovak immigrant, as were the parents of his paternal grandmother. His maternal grandfather was a German immigrant, as were the parents of his maternal grandmother. His maternal great-uncle was political activist Joseph P. Kamp (1900-1993), a leader of the anti-communist organization \"Constitutional Educational League\".\n\nVoight has two siblings: volcanologist Barry Voight (1937-) and singer-songwriter James Wesley Voight (pseudonym Chip Taylor, 1940-). Barry is most famous for first predicting and then investigating the eruption of Mount St. Helens (1980). James is most famous for writing the hit songs \"Wild Thing\" (1965) and \"Angel of the Morning\" (1967).\n\nVoight was educated at Archbishop Stepinac High School, an all-boys Roman Catholic high school located at White Plains, New York. At the time, the school was operated by the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of New York. He took an interest in acting in his high school years, performing a comedic role in the school's annual musical, \"The Song of Norway\". He graduated in 1956, at the age of 18.\n\nVoight continued his education at The Catholic University of America, located in Washington, D.C.. He majored in art, and graduated in 1960. He was 22-years-old at the time of graduation. He then moved to New York City, having decided to pursue an acting career.\n\nIn the early 1960s, Voight primarily worked as a television actor. He guest starred in episodes of then-popular television series, such as \"Naked City\", \"The Defenders\", \"NET Playhouse\", \"12 O'Clock High\", and \"Gunsmoke\". His first notable theatrical role was playing the illegal immigrant Rodolfo in a 1965 Off-Broadway production of the play \"A View from the Bridge\" (1955) by Arthur Miller (1915-2005). In the play, Rodolfo is the love interest of the American girl Catherine, and disliked by her uncle and guardian Eddie Carbone (who is in love with his niece).\n\nVoight made his film debut in the superhero comedy \"Fearless Frank\" (1967), playing the role of the eponymous superhero. Frank was depicted as a murder victim who gets resurrected and granted superpowers by a scientist. Voiight's second film role was playing historical gunman and outlaw Curly Bill Brocius (1845-1882) in the Western film \"Hour of the Gun\" (1967). The historical Brocius was an an enemy of the Esrp family, and was killed by Wyatt Earp (1848-1929).\n\nVoigh't third film appearance was \"Midnight Cowboy\" (1969), his first great success. He played the role of a naive hustler from Texas who tries to become a gigolo in New York City. The film was critically acclaimed, and became the only X-rated feature to win Best Picture at the Academy Awards. Voight was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Actor, but the award was instead won by rival actor John Wayne (1907-1979).\n\nVoight's first role in the 1970s was playing lieutenant Milo Minderbinder in the black comedy \"Catch-22\" (1970). The film was based on a 1961 satirical novel by Joseph Heller (1923-1999), and offered a satirical view on war and bureaucracy. Voight's next role was playing the left-wing student A in the political drama \"The Revolutionary\" (1970).\n\nVoight found further critical acclaim with the thriller film \"Deliverance\" (1972), playing Atlanta businessman Ed Gentry. In the film, Gentry and his first are targeted by villainous mountain men in the northern Georgia wilderness. The film earned about 46 million dollars at the domestic box office, and was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Picture.\n\nHis subsequent roles included idealistic schoolteacher Pat Conroy in \"Conrack\" (1974), journalist Peter Miller in \"The Odessa File\" (1974). His next great success was playing paraplegic war veteran Luke Martin in \"Coming Home\" (1978), in a role inspired by the life of war veteran and anti-war activist Ron Kovic (1976-). He won the Academy Award for Best Actor for this film. His co-star Jane Fonda (1937-) won her second Academy Award for Best Actress for her role in this film.\n\nVoight's early 1980s roles included conman Alex Kovac in \"Lookin' to Get Out\" (1982) and widowed father J. P. Tannen in \"Table for Five\" (1983). His next big success was the role of escaped convict Oscar \"Manny\" Manheim in \"Runaway Train\" (1985). He was again nominated for the Academy Award for Best Actor, but the Award was instead won by rival actor William Hurt (1950-).\n\nVoight's next role was that of Jack Chismore in the drama film \"Desert Bloom\" (1986). Chismore is depicted as a war veteran suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), who is trying to raise three stepdaughters. He frequently abuses his stepdaughter Rose Chismore (played by Annabeth Gish), but is genuinely concerned for her safety when Rose runs away from home. This film was Voigh's last film role for several years, as he took a hiatus from acting.\n\nVoight returned to acting with the drama film \"Eternity\" (1990), where he was also the screenwriter. The film deals with reincarnation, as a medieval war within brothers continues in modern American politics. Following his return to acting, Voight started appearing frequently in television films and miniseries. He also guest-starred in a 1994 episode of \"Seinfeld\", playing himself.\n\nVoight returned to film acting with the crime drama \"Heat\" (1995), where he had a minor role as a fence. He had a more substantial role in the spy film \"Mission: Impossible\" (1996), where he played spymaster James Phelps. The film was an adaptation of the popular television series \"Mission: Impossible\" (1966-1973), about the adventures of a group of secret agents. The role of James Phelps was previously played by actor Peter Graves (1926-2010). The film was a great commercial success, earning about 458 million dollars at the worldwide box office.\n\nVoight appeared in six different films in 1997, one of the busiest years of his career. The most notable among them was the horror film \"Anaconda\" (1997), where he played obsessive hunter Paul Serone, the film's main antagonist. The film won about 137 million dollars at the box office, despite a mostly negative critical reception. For this role, Voight was nominated for the Golden Raspberry Award for Worst Actor. He lost the award to rival actor Kevin Costner (1955-).\n\nHis next notable role was that Thomas Brian Reynolds, agent of the National Security Agency (NSA) in the action thriller \"Enemy of the State\" (1998). In the film, the NSA conspires to expand the surveillance powers of intelligence agencies over individuals and groups, at the cost of American citizens' right to privacy. The film was another box office success in Voight's career, earning about 251 million dollars at the box office.\n\nIn the same year, Voight played inspector Ned Kenny in the crime film \"The General\" (1998). The film was loosely based on the career of Irish crime boss Martin Cahill (1949-1994), who was nicknamed \"the General\". The film was critically acclaimed and director John Boorman won the Cannes Film Festival Award for Best Director.\n\nVoight's next notable role was that of domineering coach Bud Kilmer in the sports film \"Varsity Blues\" (1999). The film dealt with the difficulties in the life of the players of a Texas-based high school football team, and was not expected to attract much attention by audiences. It earned about 54 million dollars at the box office, making it a modest box office hit. It is credited with introducing Voight to a next generation of fans.\n\nVoight's final film in the 1990s was \"A Dog of Flanders\" (1999), based on a 1872 novel by Ouida (1839-1908). He played the role of artist Michel La Grande, the mentor of Nello (played by Jeremy James Kissner), who is eventually revealed to be Nello's biological father. The film failed at the box office, failing to earn as much as its modest budget.\n\nVoight appeared in no film released in 2000, but had a busy year in 2001. He appeared in several box office hits of the year. He played President of the United States Franklin Delano Roosevelt (1882-1945, term 1933-1945) in the war drama \"Pearl Harbor\", Lara Croft's father Lord Richard Croft in the action film \"Lara Croft: Tomb Raider\", coal-miner and working class father Larry Zoolander in action comedy \"Zoolander\", and sports journalist Howard Cosell in the biographical film \"Ali\". For his role in \"Ali\", Voight was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor. The award was instead won by rival actor Jim Broadbent (1949-). It was Voight's fourth and (so far) last nomination for an Academy Award.\n\nVoight had a notable role playing Pope John Paul II (1920-2005, term 1978-2005) in the miniseries \"Pope John Paul II\" (2005). He was nominated for the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Lead Actor in a Limited Series or Movie, but the award was instead won by rival actor Andre Braugher (1962-).\n\nVoight had a supporting role as John Keller, United States Secretary of Defense in the science fiction film \"Transformers\" (2007). The film was based on the Transformers toy line by Hasbro.It earned about 710 million dollars at the box office, one of the most commercially successful films in Voight's career.\n\nIn 2009, Voight had a notable television role, playing Jonas Hodges, the CEO of a Virginia-based private military company in the then-popular television series \"24\" (2001-2010, 2014). He was a main antagonist in the seventh season of the series. His role was inspired by the careers of Hessian colonel Johann Rall (c. 1726-1776), German industrialist Alfried Krupp von Bohlen und Halbach (1907-1967), and private military company CEO Erik Prince (1969-).\n\nHis 2010s notable film roles include the role of Dracula's enemy Loonardo Van Helsing in the horror film \"Dracula: The Dark Prince\" (2013), football coach Paul William \"Bear\" Bryant (1913-1983) in the sports drama \"Woodlawn\" (2015), and newspaper owner Henry Shaw Sr. in \"Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them\" (2016). \"Fantastic Beasts\" earned about 814 million dollars at the worldwide box office, being one of the most commercially successful films that Voight ever appeared in.\n\nIn 2020, was 82-years-old, and he is still working as an actor.\n\nKurt Vogel Russell was born on March 17, 1951 in Springfield, Massachusetts and raised in Thousand Oaks, California to Louise Julia Russell (n√©e Crone), a dancer & Bing Russell, an actor. He is of English, German, Scottish and Irish descent. His first roles were as a child on television series, including a lead role on the Western series The Travels of Jaimie McPheeters (1963).

Walt Disney himself signed Russell to a 10-year contract, and, according to Robert Osborne, he became the studio's top star of the 1970s. Having voiced adult Copper in the animated Disney film Cap und Capper (1981), Russell is one of the few famous child stars in Hollywood who has been able to continue his acting career past his teen years.\n\nKurt spent the early 1970s playing minor league baseball. In 1979, he gave a classic performance as Elvis Presley in John Carpenter's ABC TV movie Elvis - The King (1979), and married the actress who portrayed Priscilla Presley in the film, Season Hubley.

MacReady in the horror film Das Ding aus einer anderen Welt (1982), and Jack Burton in the fantasy film Big Trouble in Little China (1986), all of which have since become cult classics.\n\nIn 1983, he became reacquainted with Goldie Hawn (who appeared with him in The One and Only, Genuine, Original Family Band (1968)) when they worked together on Swing Shift - Liebe auf Zeit (1984). The two have lived together ever since. They made another film together, Garry Marshall's comedy Overboard - Ein Goldfisch f√§llt ins Wasser (1987).

Garcia's family was relatively affluent. However, when he was two years old, Fidel Castro came to power, and the family fled to Miami Beach. Forced to work menial jobs for a while, the family started a fragrance company that was eventually worth more than a million dollars. He attended Natilus Junior High School and later at Miami Beach Senior High School. Andy was a popular student in school, a good basketball player and good-looking. He dreamed of playing professional baseball. In his senior year, though, he contracted mononucleosis and hepatitis, and unable to play sports, he turned his attention to acting.\n\nHe studied acting with Jay W. Jensen. Jensen was a South Florida legend, counting among his numerous students, Brett Ratner, Roy Firestone, Mickey Rourke, and Luther Campbell. Following his positive high school experiences in acting, he continued his drama studies at Florida International University.\n\nSoon, he was headed out to Hollywood. His first break came as a gang member on the very first episode of the popular TV series Polizeirevier Hill Street (1981). His role as a cocaine kingpin in 8 Millionen Wege zu sterben (1986) put him on the radar of Brian De Palma, who was casting for his gangster classic The Untouchables: Die Unbestechlichen (1987). At first, he envisioned Garcia as Al Capone's sadistic henchman Frank Nitti, but fearing typecasting as a gangster, Garcia campaigned for the role of \"George Stone\", the Italian cop who gets accepted into Eliot Ness' famous band of lawmen. Garcia's next notable role came in Black Rain (1989) by acclaimed director Ridley Scott, as the partner of police detective Michael Douglas. He then co-starred with Richard Gere in Internal Affairs - Trau' ihm, er ist ein Cop (1990), directed by Mike Figgis. In 1989, Francis Ford Coppola was casting for the highly anticipated third installment of his \"Godfather\" films. Der Pate 3 (1990) included one of the most sought-after roles in decades, the hot-headed son of \"Sonny Corleone\" and mob prot√©g√© of \"Michael Corloene\", \"Vincent Mancini\". A plum role for any young rising star, the role was campaigned for by a host of actors. Val Kilmer, Alec Baldwin, Vincent Spano, Charlie Sheen, and even Robert De Niro (who wanted the role changed to accommodate his age) were all beaten out by the up-and-coming Garcia. His performance was Oscar-nominated as Best Supporting Actor, and secured him international stardom and a place in cinematic history. Now a leading man, he starred in such films as Jennifer 8 ist die N√§chste (1992) and Ein ganz normaler Held (1992). He won raves for his role as the husband of Meg Ryan in When a Man Loves a Woman - Eine fast perfekte Liebe (1994) and gave another charismatic gangster turn in Das Leben nach dem Tod in Denver (1995). He then returned in Nacht √ºber Manhattan (1996), directed by Sidney Lumet, as well as portraying legendary mobster Lucky Luciano in Hoodlum (1997). In perhaps his most mainstream role, he portrayed a cop in the action film Desperate Measures (1998). Garcia then starred in a few lower-profile projects that didn't do much for his career, but things turned around in 2001, with the first of many projects being his role as a cold casino owner in Ocean's Eleven (2001), directed by Steven Soderbergh. Seeing his removal from Cuba as involuntary, Garcia is proud of his heritage which influences his life and work. One such case is his portrayal of renowned Cuban trumpet player Arturo Sandoval in Die Jazz Connection (2000). He is an extremely private man, and strong believer in old-fashioned chivalry. Married to his wife, Maria Victoria, since 1982, the couple has three daughters. One of the most talented leading men around, Garcia has had a unique career of staying true to his own ideals and thoughts on acting. While some would have used some of the momentum he has acquired at different points in his career to get rich off lightweight projects, Garcia has stayed true to stories and films that aspire to something more. But with a presence and style that never seem old, a respect from directors and film buffs, alike, Andy Garcia will be remembered for a long time in film history.\n\nKristy Swanson is an American actress from California. She has had an active acting career since the 1980s. Her most memorable role was playing the original version of Buffy Summers in the horror comedy \"Buffy the Vampire Slayer\" (1992).\n\nSwanson was born in Mission Viejo, California, a planned community in Orange County. It is located in a hilly region, 49 miles (79 kilometers) southeast of Los Angeles. Swanson developed an interest in acting in early childhood. She started pursuing roles in television commercials at the age of 9, and first appeared in a commercial for doll houses. She continued to regularly appear in commercials for a few years.\n\nSwanson received acting lessons from \"The Actors Workshop\", an acting school developed by Canadian actor R. J. Adams (1942 -2015). In 1984, Swanson started appearing in one-shot roles in television. She gained attention for playing Stephanie Brandon in the episode \"On the Street\" (1985) of the police procedural \"Cagney & Lacey\". Her character was a teenage prostitute who was considered a key witness in a murder trial. For this role Swanson was nominated for a Young performer award, the \"Best Young Actress - Guest in a Television Series\". The award was instead won by rival actress Jaclyn Bernstein.\n\nIn 1986, Swanson had the supporting role of Jennifer Davis in the television film \"Mr. Boogedy\", a ghost story about a haunted house in New England. She had a minor role in the teen comedy-drama film \"Pretty in Pink\" (1986). as the new love interest of the character Duckie Dale (played by Jon Cryer). She had her first speaking role in a film in \"Ferris Bueller's Day Off\", as a girl who announces a convoluted excuse to explain the main character's absence. Swanson had her co-starring role in a film in \"Deadly Friend\" (1986), a science fiction horror film by famed director Wes Craven. It gained a cult following over the following decades.\n\nSwanson's next starring role was in the psychological horror film \"Flowers in the Attic\" (1987), concerning children held captive by their abusive family. She played Cathy Dollanganger, the elder sister among the captives. The film earned about 15,2 million dollars at the domestic box office. There were plans for a sequel film, but it ended in development hell. In 1987, Swanson joined the cast of the soap opera Knots Landing (1979-1993), in the recurring role of Jody Campbell. She appeared in a total of 8 episodes, leaving the series in 1988.\n\nSwanson had her first main role in a television series in the short-lived medical drama \"Nightingales\" (1989), where she played student nurse Rebecca \"Becky\" Granger. The series was controversial at the time for its overly sexualized depiction of nurses. It inspired a protest campaign by the American Nurses Association, causing several sponsors to withdraw their support from their series. The series was canceled after a single season and 13 episodes, plus a television film. There was later a revival of the series' concept under the title \"University Hospital\" (1995), but Swanson was not involved with the revival series.\n\nSwanson had her first film role in years in the romantic comedy \"Dream Trap\" (1990). The film depicted the romantic fantasies two teenagers have about each other. Her co-star for this film was Sasha Jenson (1964-). Swanson's next notable film role was in the fantasy comedy \"Mannequin Two: On the Move\" (1991). She played Jessie, a 14th-century peasant girl who was turned into a statue by a sorcerer. She is revived in the late 20th century, and falls in love with a descendant of her original lover. The film only earned 4 million dollars at the box office, failing to recover its production costs. It was marketed as a sequel to the hit film \"Mannequin\" (1987), while featuring none of its main characters.\n\nSwanson had a supporting role in the comedy film \"Hot Shots!\" (1991). She played Kowalski, a female pilot of the United States Navy who is regarded as male by her peers and superiors. The film earned 180 million dollars worldwide, the highest earning film in Swanson's career at that time. Swanson had the co-starring role of Rachel Clark in the horror comedy \"Highway to Hell\" (1991). In the film, Rachel is kidnapped by a demon and taken to hell. She is about to be married to Satan, but her boyfriend Charlie Sykes (played by Chad Lowe) attempts to rescue her. The film only had a limited theatrical release, but was relatively popular in the home video market.\n\nIn 1992, Swanson had the leading role of Buffy in the horror comedy film \"Buffy the Vampire Slayer\" (1992). In the film, Buffy is a high school cheerleader with an ordinary life, who discovers that she is the latest in a long line of female vampire slayers. She has to stop a vampire army from taking over Los Angeles, at the cost of alienating her friends and losing her boyfriend. The film was modestly successful at the box office, earning about 17 million dollars. It was more successful in the home video market, and inspired the spin-off television series \"Buffy the Vampire Slayer\" (1997-2003). Swanson had no involvement with this series, replaced in the title role by Sarah Michelle Gellar (1977-).\n\nSwanson had a supporting role in the sports drama film \"The Program\" (1993), as tennis player Camille Shafer. The character was the love interest of one of the main characters, American football player Joe Kane (played Craig Sheffer). Swanson shared the female lead status in this film with Halle Berry (1966-). The film highlighted the use of steroids in college football. The film earned about 23 million dollars at the box office, a modest hit for its time.\n\nSwanson played the role of heiress Natalie Voss in the action comedy \"The Chase\" (1994). In the film, Natalie is kidnapped by escaped convict Jack Hammond (played by Charlie Sheen), because he wanted a hostage. It was commended for its satirical look at tabloid journalism, and at the obsession of television news shows with car chases. Swanson had a supporting role in the black comedy \"Getting In\" (1994). In the film, there are serial murders of students who are on the top of the list for admission to medical school. A student is trying to eliminate his competitors to get ahead on the list. It is remembered as the directorial debut for Doug Liman.\n\nIn 1995, Swanson had a co-starring role in the university-themed drama film \"Higher Learning\". She played Kristen Connor, an initially shy student who proceeds to explore her bisexual tendencies by pursuing two different romantic relationships at the same time. The film earned about 38 million dollars at the domestic box office, becoming the 44th highest-grossing film of its year. It was also successful at the home video market. From Swanson's perspective, it was the highest-grossing film of her career since 1991.\n\nIn 1996, Swanson appeared in the superhero adaptation \"The Phantom\". It was based on the character Phantom/Kit Walker, created by Lee Falk (1911 - 1999) in 1936. Swanson played Diana Palmer, the Phantom's love interest. The film earned about 23.5 million dollars at the domestic box office, but was a major hit in the home video market.\n\nIn 1997, Swanson had a co-starring role in the Mafia-themed black comedy \"8 Heads in a Duffel Bag\". In the film, mobster Tommy Spinelli (played by Joe Pesci) has to deliver a cargo of severed heads to a crime boss, as proof for recent deaths. His duffel bag is mixed up with the luggage of an American tourist, causing much trouble for everyone involved in the case. The film under-performed at the box office, only earning 4 million dollars.\n\nIn 1998, Swanson was part of the cast in the disaster film \"Ground Control\". The film concerned the efforts of air traffic controller to perform their duties during a severe storm and a power outage. Swanson was reduced to a supporting role in the comedy film \"Big Daddy\" (1999), playing an ex-girlfriend of the film's main character, slacker Sonny Koufax (played by Adam Sandler). In 2000, Swanson had a supporting role in the stoner comedy \"Dude, Where's My Car?\". She played one of several eccentric characters which the film's protagonists encounter in their search for a missing automobile. The film was a surprise box office hit, earning 73.2 million dollars at the worldwide box office. It was Swanson's highest grossing film in nearly a decade.\n\nIn 2001, Swanson played Interpol agent Tessa Jansen in the thriller film \"Soul Assassin\". The film depicted assassinations connected to a multinational banking firm. It was one of Swanson'ts last appearances in a feature film during the 2000s. Her career declined considerably during this decade. She was reduced to playing infrequent guest-star roles in then-popular television series, such as \"Just Shoot Me!\", \"CSI: Miami\", and \"Law & Order: Criminal Intent\".\n\nIn 2009, Swanson married her boyfriend Lloyd Eisler (1963-), a Canadian pairs skater who had won two Olympic medals. They have a son. In 2010, Swanson appeared in the Christian film \"What If...\", making her first appearance in a theatrical film in several years. She played Wendy Walker, the original girlfriend of businessman Ben Walker (played by Kevin Sorbo).\n\nDuring the 2010s, Swanson appeared frequently in television films and direct-to-video films. She was part of the main cast in \"Beethoven's Treasure Tail\" (2014), the 8th and (so far) last film in the long-running film series \"Beethoven\" (1992-2014). In the early 2020s, Swanson continues to regularly appear in films. By 2021, Swanson was 52-years-old. She he has no intention to retire yet. Several of her older films remain popular, and she still has a fan following.\n\nLegendary actor Glenn Ford was born Gwyllyn Samuel Newton Ford in Sainte-Christine-d'Auvergne, Quebec, Canada, to Hannah Wood (Mitchell) and Newton Ford, a railroad executive. His family moved to Santa Monica, California when he was eight years old. His acting career began with plays at high school, followed by acting in West Coast, a traveling theater company.\n\nFord was discovered in 1939 by Tom Moore, a talent scout for 20th Century Fox. He subsequently signed a contract with Columbia Pictures the same year. Ford's contract with Columbia marked a significant departure in that studio's successful business model. Columbia's boss, Harry Cohn, had spent decades observing other studios'-most notably Warner Brothers-troubles with their contract stars and had built his poverty-row studio around their loan-outs. Basically, major studios would use Columbia as a penalty box for unruly behavior-usually salary demands or work refusals. The cunning Cohn usually assigned these stars (his little studio could not normally afford then) into pictures, and the studio's status rose immensely as the 1930s progressed. Understandably, Cohn had long resisted developing his own stable of contract stars (he'd first hired Peter Lorre in 1934 but didn't know what to do with him) but had relented in the late 1930s, first adding Rosalind Russell, then signing Ford and fellow newcomer William Holden. Cohn reasoned that the two prospects could be used interchangeably, should one become troublesome. Although often competing for the same parts, Ford and Holden became good friends. Their careers would roughly parallel each other through the 1940s, until Holden became a superstar through his remarkable association with director Billy Wilder in the 1950s.\n\nFord made his official debut in Fox's Heaven with a Barbed Wire Fence (1939), and continued working in various small roles throughout the 1940s until his movie career was interrupted to join the Marines in World War II. Ford continued his military career in the Naval Reserve well into the Vietnam War, achieving the rank of captain. In 1943 Ford married legendary tap dancer Eleanor Powell, and had one son, Peter Ford. Like many actors returning to Hollywood after the war (including James Stewart and Holden (who had already acquired a serious alcohol problem), he found it initially difficult to regain his career momentum. He was able to resume his movie career with the help of Bette Davis, who gave him his first postwar break in the 1946 movie Die gro√üe L√ºge (1946). However, it was not until his acclaimed performance in a 1946 classic film noir, Gilda (1946), with Rita Hayworth, that he became a major star and one of the the most popular actors of his time. He scored big with the film noir classics Hei√ües Eisen (1953) and Die Saat der Gewalt (1955), and was usually been cast as a calm and collected everyday-hero, showing courage under pressure. Ford continued to make many notable films during his prestigious 50-year movie career, but he is best known for his fine westerns such as Z√§hl bis drei und bete (1957) and Nebraska (1965). Ford pulled a hugely entertaining turn in In Colorado ist der Teufel los (1958) and many more fine films. In the 1970s, Ford made his television debut in the controversial The Brotherhood of the Bell (1970) and appeared in two fondly remembered television series: Sheriff Cade (1971) and The Family Holvak (1975). During the 1980s and 1990s, Ford limited his appearance to documentaries and occasional films, including a nice cameo in Superman - Der Film (1978).\n\nGlenn Ford is remembered fondly by his fans for his more than 100 excellent films and his charismatic silver screen presence.\n\nNoted these days for his dashing, sporting, jet-setting playboy image and perpetually bronzed skin tones in commercials, film spoofs and reality shows, George Hamilton was, at the onset, a serious contender for dramatic film stardom. Born George Stevens Hamilton in Memphis, TN, on August 12, 1939, the son of gregarious Southern belle beauty Anne Lucille (Stevens) Potter Hamilton Hunt Spaulding, and her husband (of four), George William \"Spike\" Hamilton, a touring bandleader. Moving extensively as a youth due to his father's work (Arkansas, Massachusetts, New York, California), young George got a taste of acting in plays while attending Palm Beach High School. With his exceedingly handsome looks and attractive personality, he took a bold chance and moved to Los Angeles in the late 1950s.\n\nMGM (towards the end of the contract system) saw in George a budding talent with photogenic appeal. It wasted no time putting him in films following some guest appearances on TV. His first film, a lead in Crime & Punishment, USA (1959), was an offbeat, updated adaptation of the Fyodor Dostoevsky novel. While the film was not overwhelmingly successful, George's heartthrob appeal was obvious. He was awarded a Golden Globe for \"Most Promising Newcomer\" as well as being nominated for \"Best Foreign Actor\" by the British film Academy (BAFTA). This in turn led to an enviable series of film showcases, including the memorable Southern drama Das Erbe des Blutes (1960), which starred Robert Mitchum and Eleanor Parker and featured another handsome, up-and-coming George (George Peppard); Angel Baby (1961), in which he played an impressionable lad who meets up with evangelist Mercedes McCambridge; and Licht auf der Piazza (1962) (another BAFTA nomination), in which he portrays an Italian playboy who falls madly for American tourist Yvette Mimieux to the ever-growing concern of her mother Olivia de Havilland. Along with the good, however, came the bad and the inane, which included the dreary sudsers Fr√ºchte einer Leidenschaft (1960) and Und die Nacht wird schweigen (1961) and the youthful spring-break romps Dazu... geh√∂ren zwei (1960), which had Connie Francis warbling the title tune while slick-as-car-seat-leather George pursued coed Dolores Hart, and Looking for Love (1964), which was more of the same.\n\nNot yet undone by this mixed message of serious actor and glossy pin-up, George went on to show some real acting muscle in the offbeat casting of a number of biopics -- as Moss Hart in Act One (1963), an overly fictionalized and sanitized account of the late playwright (the real Moss should have looked so good!), as ill-fated country star Hank Williams in Your Cheatin' Heart (1964), and as the famed daredevil Evel Knievel (1971).\n\nThe rest of the '60s and '70s, however, rested on his fun-loving, idle-rich charm that bore a close resemblance to his off-camera image in the society pages. As the 1960s began to unfold, he started making headlines more as a handsome escort to the rich, the powerful and the beautiful than as an acclaimed actor -- none more so than his 1966 squiring of President Lyndon B. Johnson's daughter Lynda Bird Johnson. He was also once engaged to actress Susan Kohner, a former co-star. Below-average films such as Doktor - Sie machen Witze! (1967), Der gnadenlose Ritt (1967) and Die sechs Verd√§chtigen (1968) effectively ended his initially strong ascent to film stardom.\n\nFrom the 1970s on George tended to be tux-prone on standard film and TV comedy and drama, whether as a martini-swirling opportunist, villain or lover. A wonderful comeback for him came in the form of the disco-era Dracula spoof Liebe auf den ersten Biss (1979), which he executive-produced. Nominated for a Golden Globe as the campy neck-biter displaced and having to fend off the harsh realities of New York living, he continued on the parody road successfully with Zorro mit der hei√üen Klinge (1981) in the very best Mel Brooks tradition.\n\nThis renewed popularity led to a one-year stint on Der Denver-Clan (1981) during the 1985-1986 season and a string of fun, self-mocking commercials, particularly his Ritz Cracker and (Toasted!) Wheat Thins appearances that often spoofed his overly tanned appearance. In recent times he has broken through the \"reality show\" ranks by hosting The Family (2003), which starred numerous members of a traditional Italianate family vying for a $1,000,000 prize, and participating in the second season of ABC's Dancing with the Stars (2005), where his charm and usual impeccable tailoring scored higher than his limberness. On the tube he can still pull off a good time, whether playing flamboyant publisher William Randolph Hearst in Rough Riders - Das furchtlose Regiment (1997), playing the best-looking Santa Claus ever in Coole Weihnachten (2004), hosting beauty pageants or making breezy gag appearances. In 1989 he started a line of skin-care products and a chain of tanning salons.\n\nInto the millennium, he has had featured roles in the \"opera singer trio reunion\" comedy Off Key (2001) also starring Joe Mantegna and Danny Aiello; the offbeat underground film Reflections of Evil (2002); the comedy romps The L.A. Riot Spectacular (2005) and Melvin Smarty (2012); the political drama The Congressman (2016); the family dramedy Silver Skies (2016); and the romantic comedy Swiped (2018). On TV, he enhanced several programs including \"Nash Bridges,\" \"Pushing Daisies,\" \"Hot in Cleveland\" and \"Grace and Frankie.\" He also had a recurring role on the series American Housewife (2016). Beginning in the summer of 2016, Hamilton appeared in TV commercials as the \"Extra Crispy\" sun-tanned version of KFC's Colonel Harland Sanders. He later played the Colonel on an episode of \"General Hospital.\"\n\nGeorge managed one brief marriage to actress/TV personality Alana Stewart from 1972 to 1975 (she later married and divorced rock singer Rod Stewart), the pair have a son, actor Ashley Hamilton, born in 1974. Another son, George Thomas Hamilton, born in 2000, came from his involvement with Kimberly Blackford."
