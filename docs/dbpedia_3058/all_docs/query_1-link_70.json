        "text": "Every new episode revolves around a single character, guiding us on an inevitably winding and interconnecting journey through their last seven years. There’s a core conflict running through the whole season, but it’s perpetually shifting and confusing, and I found myself constantly having to pause the show to remember why Michael ended up in this restaurant, or why he’s pretending he doesn’t know Lindsay. It doesn't really matter, though — it's just a loose thread tying everyone together, and we're probably better off not tugging too hard at it.\n\nI hated season four from the second it started. Netflix's bumper is ugly, odd, and cloying, pointing out that it's only a \"semi-original series.\" Then for the next three episodes, from Ron Howard's narratorial throat-clearing to the \"Showstealer Pro Trial Version\" watermark splashed over footage from old seasons, Arrested Development is hell-bent on reminding us that it was cancelled seven years ago.\n\n\"... otherwise he's going to have to Skype me from a TGI Friday's.\"\n\nI laughed out loud exactly once during those three episodes, and nearly gave up watching the show entirely — the first 90 minutes of season four felt longer than the next six hours. (That one respite was thanks to the re-introduction of the casual racism Arrested Development does so well.) There are too many flashbacks, too much re-introduction, too much time spent essentially saying \"OMG you guys can you believe they cancelled us?\"\n\nBut slowly over the next few episodes, the show finds its footing again, as it re-introduces so many of the characters and jokes that made it famous. George Michael’s hyper-religious ex-girlfriend Ann Veal comes back with a vengeance, somehow still delightfully insignificant even in a much-expanded role. Family patriarch George Sr. and his identical twin Oscar spend a lot of time together, a Jeffrey-Tambor-on-Jeffrey-Tambor dynamic I wish we'd seen more of before.\n\nThere are callbacks everywhere, from the Mr. Banana Grabber shirt to a Mr. F reference you'd miss if you were breathing too loudly at the time. Nearly everything's here, except as best I can tell no one ever said \"There's always money in the banana stand\" and there's only the slightest hint of a chicken dance. Both are devastating omissions.\n\nEach story revolves around the same three or four scenes, like George Michael’s high-school graduation and a fundraiser / concert / room filled with awkward people for Herbert Love’s campaign. Everything comes to a head on Cinco de Cuatro, a holiday invented by the Bluths to use up all the party decorations and keep their housekeeper from leaving every year to celebrate Cinco de Mayo.\n\nThe storytelling structure is an obvious way to get around the actors’ busy schedules, and points to the original goal of releasing episodes with no set order, but the strange Rashomon effect doesn’t always work. It just creates a lot of overlap — a few moments appear six or seven different times — and a lot of confusion about what’s happening and when.\n\nThe Bluths may not have changed, but the actors' lives certainly have. Creator Mitch Hurwitz has said Tony Hale was particularly hard to get because he’s also shooting Veep, and other actors were similarly difficult — Arrested Development launched many careers, and it lead to only two days with the whole cast on set at the same time. It results in clear troubles with telling the story coherently, and more than a few scenes are so unrealistic the crew might as well have left the green screen in the shot with Portia De Rossi and David Cross.\n\nSo much of the fun of Arrested Development was just watching these dysfunctional people be near each other, and there's precious little of it in season four. Some characters are also just gone, for episodes at a time. We see far too little of GOB and Buster, two of the show's most interesting and compelling characters, and as a result we're forced to spend way too much time with both real-life Ron Howard (as part of a subplot around making what is presumably the Arrested Development movie) and narrator Ron Howard.\n\nThe seventh episode, where we finally spend some quality time with GOB, is where season four finally rises to Arrested Development standards. GOB takes his guy-in-a-$10,000-suit stammering to new levels, and gives Steve Carell's Bruce Almighty performance a run for its money. GOB's episode also brings Steve Holt back, who steals the whole season before he even says a word.\n\nThe momentum continues from there through to the end, with only a clunker or two in between – as the disparate stories start to clash, the show regains its old luster. Plus, it takes eight or so episodes to take each character's pursuits to their bizarre, narcissistic extremes, which is where, say, Michael comes alive in a guilt-trip game of chicken with his son over a series of escalating voicemails. Tobias' story was my favorite, following him as he trades his analrapist hat for something almost as wonderful.\n\nThe original plan for this season of Arrested Development was 10 episodes, and Netflix should've stuck to it, especially since Hurwitz and co. don’t have to bend over backwards to make each episode stand on its own. There is an order now, and with it comes freedom the crew should have taken advantage of. As is, the show leans too heavily on what's basically a \"previously on Arrested Development…\" crutch in the middle of episodes, which flits between unnecessary and downright boring.\n\nBut even if there’s a bit too much of it, the show is still fun, funny, and as weird and watchable as ever. I can’t wait to watch it all again, when it’s not 4:12 in the morning — knowing what I know now, I think I might even like the first few episodes more the second time.\n\nSeason four is absolutely worthy of the Arrested Development name, though you'll have to slog through three episodes before it becomes so. And trust me: don't watch the show without having seen the first three seasons, and maybe re-watch them again just in case. Even for all its heavy-handed exposition, the show introduces basically no new running jokes or motifs, and if you don't know about the too-literal doctor or Gene Parmesan, you're in rough shape."
