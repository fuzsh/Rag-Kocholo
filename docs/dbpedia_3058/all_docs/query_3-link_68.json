        "text": "5\n\nEVI, Official Booking Agency Hans Zimmer. Contact EVI about Booking Hans Zimmer.\n\nNu Skin Live 2019. Designed to Ignite…to motivate a worldwide gathering of 15,000 top level distributors in unique and unexpected ways. The Nu Skin business proposition, with its extraordinary leadership, its history and culture, advanced technology, innovative products and its commitment to giving…is in a word…peerless.\n\nBut more than anything, Nu Skin is invested in its people. They believe… and stop at no end to make sure that every distributor believes…not only in Nu Skin…but in themselves… in the life path they have chosen. Each has a unique story to tell, and Nu Skin wants them to tell it to the world.\n\nMotivated by this humanistic spirit, EVI, the leading Producer and Hans Zimmer Booking Agent, started dreaming about a one of a kind session to cap off a vibrant convention week. They envisioned bringing together two of Hollywood’s most iconic storytellers to provide an inside look at how the world’s top movies are made. Enter Academy Award Winning Film Composer Hans Zimmer…and Oscar Winning Director Ron Howard.\n\nThe aim was to inspire the Nu Skin audience through the unique perspectives of these cinematic masters, to unlock their inner storyteller, be encouraged to reflect on their own life journeys, the importance of their own stories, and how to develop them and bring them to reality.\n\nThe team architected a 45 minute session built around the way that Zimmer and Howard craft stories for major motion pictures. The idea was to identify and explore four facets of their working processes, and present them as short chapters, or movements, that would combine to create a cohesive story. Built around this framework, Ruth Todd, Nu Skin SVP of Public Affairs, served as a masterful guide to explore the thoughts of these extraordinarily imaginative creative artists.\n\nTo introduce each chapter, EVI curated a collection of the greatest moments from Zimmer and Howard’s iconic films. Pivotal scenes from Gladiator, Apollo 13, Rush and The Lion King left the audience spellbound and served as springboards for the next part of the conversation.\n\nConversing with the maestros, several common themes emerged about their working methods that would prove highly relatable to the audience.\n\nThe central theme was that in our own respective ways…“We Are All Storytellers”. We all get inspired…things stir our emotions… send us in certain directions…compel us to make certain decisions about our lives. That’s the process of discovering our own unique story. Thus, the first chapter…”Inspiration…Dreaming the Big Dream”.\n\nBut what happens after the moment of inspiration and we’ve chosen our direction? How do we harness that and transform it into workable ideas. “Bringing the Story to Life” was a discussion about Developing and Building Our Story…the challenges we face in getting things started…the process of analyzing/scrutinizing and creative problem solving…arriving at creative solutions.\n\n“Collaboration” was another major theme to explore. How do we choose who to work with, how do we get others on board with our ideas, and what makes certain collaborations work.\n\nAnd finally… The Art of “Creating a Masterwork”. Ultimate Realization and Success. How does it all come together? What sets the great projects apart and empowers us to seek out the next level.\n\nIn the end…a compelling and relatable sequence unfolded. What a great honor it was to have two legendary masters of modern cinema share their personal insights. Through their unique creative languages, they inspired the audience to realize that indeed…We Are All Storytellers…and encouraged them to Go Out…Find a Story You Love…and Tell It!\n\nExecutive Visions, Hans Zimmer Booking Agent.
