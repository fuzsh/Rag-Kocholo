        "text": "Even the paranormal powers of The Exorcist are no match for Taylor Swift and the legion of devoted fans she commands. Following Swift’s announcement of a concert film documenting her blockbuster Eras Tour, set to hit theaters on October 13, The Exorcist: Believer, a sequel to the 1973 original, has fled to another date.\n\nThe Universal horror film, originally slated for Friday, October 13, will now debut a week earlier on October 6. Blumhouse head Jason Blum announced the move on social media, writing, “Look what you made me do. The Exorcist: Believer moves to 10/6/23. #TaylorWins.” The Exorcist’s new competition? Sony’s Dumb Money, director Craig Gillespie’s film unpacking the GameStop stock drama of 2021, starring Paul Dano and Seth Rogen.\n\nThis shift has already proven to be a prudent one. According to The Hollywood Reporter, ticket presales for Taylor Swift: The Eras Tour have hit $26 million after the first day for distributor AMC Theatres, breaking the record for the highest-ever single-day advance ticket sales, which was previously set by Spider-Man: No Way Home in 2021 with $16.9 million. AMC has since added showtimes to the theatrical run, which will happen in the United States, Canada, and Mexico. Tickets start at $19.89 for adults and $13.13 for children.\n\nAs for The Exorcist: Believer, Ellen Burstyn, star of William Friedkin’s Oscar-winning original, is returning as Chris MacNeil, whose life was forever changed when her daughter, Regan, experienced a paranormal event. In the film, set 50 years after that possession, Leslie Odom Jr. plays Victor Fielding, a father who seeks Chris’s help when his daughter experiences a similar haunting. Halloween trilogy director David Gordon Green is helming the follow-up, the first in a planned trilogy. The second installment, The Exorcist: Deceiver, is set for April 18, 2025.\n\nPolitics\n\nDonald Trump Has Nothing Else\n\nWhen the ex-president is desperate, he gets stuck on the 2020 election—and racist taunts.\n\nTelevision\n\nHouse of the Dragon Should End After Season Three\n\nHBO’s Game of Thrones prequel series had a mostly strong second season, but it’s time to start wrapping things up.\n\nPolitics\n\nDemocrats Are Having Fun?\n\nThey just had to listen to voters.\n\nStyle\n\nIf J.D. Vance’s Spotify Account Is Real, Well, It’s On-Brand\n\nHis political views put him outside of the Millennial mainstream, but the 39-year-old VP nominee might have music tastes that place him firmly in the early 2010s.\n\nPolitics\n\nTrump’s GOP Swings and Misses With Desperate Attacks on Kamala Harris\n\nRepublicans built a campaign around assailing Joe Biden. But now he’s out and Trumpworld can’t seem to figure out how to hit Harris besides warmed-over racist and sexist insults.\n\nHollywood\n\nThe Real Reason Matt Damon Loves Working With Casey Affleck\n\n“You need to get every idea out,” says the star of The Instigators, in a joint interview with Affleck. “You get there a lot faster if you’re not worried about people’s feelings. So, in other words, we talk a lot of shit to each other.”\n\nPolitics\n\nTrump Was Totally Not Being Serious When He Suggested He’s Going to Appoint Himself President for Life: Republicans\n\nThis is a guy who loves democracy, after all.\n\nMovies\n\nIs a Britney Spears Biopic Officially in the Works?\n\nWicked producer and director duo Marc Platt and Jon M. Chu are reportedly attached to helm the film for Universal.\n\nPolitics\n\nCan Kamala Harris Make Joe Biden’s Campaign Her Own?\n\nThe vice president has inherited her boss’s sprawling 1,300-person campaign apparatus. Some insiders are worried that Harris needs stronger allies. “She basically has Biden’s team right now,” one says. “She needs some people in that room who are her people.”\n\nPolitics\n\nWhy Silicon Valley Elites Have Trump Fever All Over Again\n\nYears after breaking with the former president, billionaires like Elon Musk and Marc Andreessen are now crawling back to protect what they value most: their bottom lines."
