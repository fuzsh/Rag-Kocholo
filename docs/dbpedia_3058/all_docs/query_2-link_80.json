        "meta_description": "Joining &quot;In the Bedroom&quot; and &quot;The House of Sand and Fog&quot; in the new subgenre of tastefully filmed literary fiction, &quot;The Clearing&quot; is centered on the frayed but enduring marriage of Wayne and Eileen Hayes (Robert Redford and Helen Mirren), whose inner tensions (tastefully) explode when Wayne is kidnapped by a former employee (Willem Dafoe) and taken on a forced march through the Smoky Mountains.  Eileen and her two adult children try to cope with the crisis as best they can, but a pesky F.B.I. agent (Matt Craven) keeps stirring up the past, in the form of Wayne's adulterous relationship with another of his workers.   The film is self-consciously classy, in a tidy, antiseptic way of a New Yorker short story. â€” Dave Kehr",

        "text": "Wayne Hayes (Robert Redford) is a high-flying car-rental magnate. Now, somewhere in his movie-star 60's (at worst he looks like a squinty 50-year-old whose contact lenses are giving him trouble), Wayne is looking forward to a peaceful retirement with his supportive wife of several decades, Eileen (Helen Mirren).\n\nBut one morning as Wayne pulls out of the driveway of his plush Pittsburgh estate, he finds a nervous, badly dressed man waiting for him. He's Arnold Mack (Willem Dafoe), a disgruntled former employee who forces his way into Wayne's car and kidnaps him at gunpoint.\n\nAt this juncture ''The Clearing,'' Pieter Jan Brugge's independent feature, goes off in two different, asynchronous directions. Arnold forces Wayne to drive to a remote region somewhere in the Great Smoky Mountains, where he makes him get out and continue on foot. They are to hike to a mountaintop cabin where, Arnold tells Wayne, his confederates will be waiting and Wayne will be held until his wife delivers a whopping ransom.\n\nAlong the protracted journey, Arnold and Wayne have plenty of opportunity to exchange their views on opportunity in America. Arnold, a henpecked loser, believes that Wayne has had all the advantages; Wayne argues that he owes his success to no one but himself and that Arnold could have achieved everything that he has, if only he'd had the intestinal fortitude.\n\nWayne and Arnold's hike occupies, perhaps, 10 or 12 hours of narrative time; their journey goes from early morning to late evening. But Mr. Brugge has also initiated another narrative thread, one that plays out over several days as the F.B.I., led by an agent named Ray Fuller (Matt Craven), establishes its crisis center in the Hayes home while Eileen and the couple's two grown children, Tim (Alessandro Nivola) and Jill (Melissa Sagemiller), struggle with the horror of the situation.\n\nCutting between the two plotlines as if they were taking place simultaneously, Mr. Brugge, who directed the film from a screenplay by Justin Haythe, establishes a series of too-tidy parallels. As Arnold forces Wayne to realize that he is not the paragon of corporate virtue he would like to believe he is, so Eileen discovers that Wayne is not the ideal husband -- he has continued his adulterous relationship with a woman (Wendy Crewson) even though he told Eileen that he broke it off long ago.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
