        "text": "Fear of Flying\n\nWhen Homer is barred from Moe's he visits an airport bar where he is mistaken for a pilot. The airline offers him free tickets if he promises not to tell anyone that they almost let him fly a plane, but Marge freaks out on the plane and it's up to psychoanalyst Dr Zweig to explain why.\n\nThe Third Wheel Gets the Grace\n\nWill and Grace resume their chummy relationship, leaving Nathan feeling left out in the cold, and Jack and his son go shopping for school supplies.\n\nLoose Lips Sink Relationships\n\nTo get a night off from the department store where he works, Jack takes advantage of Will's desire to model there and his female supervisor's attraction to Will, setting them up on a date. Meanwhile, Grace makes the mistake of discussing previous sexual relationships with Nathan."
