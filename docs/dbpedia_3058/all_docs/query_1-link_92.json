        "text": "A Beautiful Mind\n\nA Beautiful Mind takes its inspiration from the story – if not the literal facts – of John Forbes Nash, Jr., a brilliant Princeton-educated mathematician whose theories were so groundbreaking that they eventually led to him being awarded the Nobel Prize. He was also a profoundly troubled man, struggling with high-pressure government work as a code-breaker and mental problems. In other words, if one wanted to be cynical, this is the kind of movie that just begs for multiple Oscar-nominations: A true story, grim but ultimately hopeful, great performances... bring on the gold statuettes, please.\n\nIt's a pleasure, then, to report that A Beautiful Mind is actually a very good movie. And if it was made on some level as Oscar bait, that's okay too. This is a good story, well told, that never panders to the audience (it's often pretty grim) but still manages to satisfy.\n\nCLICK HERE to read the full A Beautiful Mind review.\n\nApollo 13\n\nIt's both natural and somewhat surprising that the 1995 classic Apollo 13 (a film that's definitely on my list of the top ten movies of the Nineties) has been the first feature to be tapped for the IMAX giant screen format. What makes it natural is that the film is rousing and spectacular, a compelling adventure story and a meticulously-mounted history lesson – the kind of entertainment that's good and good for you. The surprise in the choice is that it is, in so many ways, a pretty intimate story – mostly set in interiors with a lot of close-ups. So how does IMAX, a format synonymous with epic, massive vistas and visuals, complement the human drama of this dramatization of the rescue of the Apollo 13 mission? Beautifully.\n\nOf course it helps that the movie is so great to begin with, and if it's been awhile since you checked it out (as it had for me), I can't think of a more pleasurable way than in IMAX. The big effects moments, explosive sound mix, and James Horner's soaring score are all amazing in IMAX – having seen the film only once in the theater (the rest of my viewings have been on DVD), I'd forgotten just how genuinely spectacular Apollo 13 is as a viewing experience.\n\nCLICK HERE to read the full Apollo 13: The IMAX Experience review.\n\nCinderella Man\n\nI'm sick of walking out of sports movies and hearing people say it was predictable. I mean, come on, anyone who's been going to movies for any amount of time knows that Rocky is going to win in the end. Actually, he didn't win in the first one, but few remember that. Regardless, just because a sports film is predictable and you know how it's gonna end does not mean that film can't be highly entertaining and enthralling in the journey to that point. I'm all for originality and breaking conventions and those films certainly have their place. Heck, they are some of my favorites. But I also firmly believe that a film can work within conventional storytelling and tell a great story. Cinderella Man is such a film. Sure, you know how it's going to end, but it's the precision of Howard's direction and the way he takes you there, the great performance by Russell Crowe (one of his best, which is saying something for Crowe), the intensity of the fights, and so on.\n\nCLICK HERE to read the full Cinderella Man review.\n\nBackdraft\n\nRon Howard's 1991 story about corruption and firefighters is inarguably the least heralded film in this collection. It's not for a lack of trying, though, on the director's part. He fills the cast with quality actors ranging from Donald Sutherland to Kurt Russell, J.T. Walsh, Robert De Niro, Billy Baldwin and Jennifer Jason Leigh. The premise in and of itself is good enough, combining family dynamics with a look at firefighting and a touch of corruption. The finished product is amazing to watch from a technical and audience pleasing standpoint. It just lacks the heart to resonate with the audience in a way Jim Braddock or the Apollo 13 astronauts do.\n\nAnd that's why it's inclusion here is puzzling. Each of the other films had major award nominations; Backdraft has none. This film is appreciated, maybe even admired by critics and the public alike, but no one can honestly say it's better than Apollo 13. Even Russell Crowe's performances run rings around anything the stable of actors here can generate. To be fair, it's not their fault. They're forced into a nearly impossible situation of playing against a main antagonist they can not talk to, chase or otherwise interact with. At least Roy Scheider could pet Jaws if he wanted to.\n\nWhat this entry in Howard's resume turns out to be is thrilling and well executed. We expect nothing less from the former Opie than to create good looking, high quality productions, after all. The film itself tends to be overlong at 132-minutes, retreading the same plot points one two many times in hopes the audience will get it. This set would have been stronger without Backdraft, no doubt. But does its inclusion necessarily denigrate the other productions? Not in the slightest. Rather, it is a demonstration of Howard's evolution, both as a director and a producer. His later films-especially A Beautiful Mind and Cinderella Man-are far less flashy than this one, perhaps a sign he is understanding how important substance is over style.\n\nA Beautiful Mind Score: 8 out of 10\n\nApollo 13 Score: 10 out of 10\n\nCinderella Man Score: 8 out of 10\n\nBackdraft Score: 6 out of 10\n\nAggregate Movie Score: 8 out of 10\n\nVideo and Presentation\n\nA Beautiful Mind\n\nThis disc is a direct port of the two-disc Awards Edition released way back in 2001. The only thing that is different is the art on the discs themselves. Anyway, Universal provides the same 1.85:1 anamorphic widescreen transfer that has graced DVD before. It replicates the early warm hues and later colder, darker tones without any major problems. Some scenes suffer from an overall lack of background detail; but what do you expect from a seven-year-old transfer? Fleshtones and blacks turn out well. Words on a newspaper page tend to shimmer just a bit which is, again, a minor problem.\n\nApollo 13\n\nIn general, the 2.35:1 anamorphic widescreen transfer looks incredibly clean and free of defects. The mastering process was kind to the 60s era color palette (the vessel took off in the early months of 1970), from the olive and tan décor of the Lovell home to silvers, blacks and golds of the space capsule. Most impressive are the sequences taking place in space; black levels are deep, almost vibrantly so. The only minor problem with the aesthetic of the film is a general \"old\" feeling. It's as if the film was actually made back in 1970 with technology of the time period.\n\nCinderella Man\n\nThe most recent of the films in this collection turns out to be, unsurprisingly, the best looking. There is a dank, almost milky appearance to the entire production. Based on the subject matter, the first quality is quite rightly replicated on the disc. The second? Not so much. Scenes taking place in arenas or enclosed offices have every reason to be smoky-after all, cigars and cigarettes were a staple of the time. However, in non-smoke scenes, there is no reason for this effect. Otherwise, details comes across with hard lines, almost as if the contrast has been ratcheted up a few notches. Cinderella Man sports an extremely limited color palette for most of the running time, relying on well-mastered darker tones to carry the film.\n\nApollo 13\n\nAs with the other features in this set, Backdraft hasn't been remastered or even touched up from its previous DVD outing, the 2006 Anniversary Edition. Really, it looks even more dated than that. As with Apollo 13, there is an old feeling from start to finish, most likely a relic of a 17-year-old movie. Grain is present in every scene, most obviously in dark sequences. Blacks fail to achieve a complete depth, opting to obscure details and action more often than not. Fire sequences, though, come off looking masterful; the reds, oranges and yellows pop on the screen with every bit of vibrancy they can pull off. In the end, that's why we're watching this movie, right?\n\nA Beautiful Mind Score: 7 out of 10\n\nApollo 13 Score: 8 out of 10\n\nCinderella Man Score: 8 out of 10\n\nBackdraft: 6 out of 10\n\nAggregate Video Score: 7 out of 10\n\nLanguages and Audio\n\nA Beautiful Mind\n\nEnglish and French 5.1 are the options on this dialogue-heavy production. While there is no distortion or lack of clarity resulting from a sub-par authoring process, the track never comes off as being dynamic. Only the score by James Horner stands out in any meaningful way. Dialogue is muted most of the time, a fact which may prompt some fiddling with the receiver volume. Directional effects are scattered through the film, especially in sequences taking place in university or in large crowds (as expected). It is a front-loaded mix and, while clean, isn't particularly reference quality. English and Spanish subtitles are included.\n\nApollo 13\n\nThe standout in the English 5.1 track is the score by James Horner. His sweeping, bombastic contribution to the film trumps everything else coming out of the speakers. Indeed, when the shuttle launches, each cable and gangplank retracting can be heard, but it is the soundtrack which gets the heart pumping. Smaller, ambient sounds-especially in the shuttle-come across without a problem, as does every single piece of dialogue. Directional effects are serviceable, though not attention-grabbing. Spanish and French tracks are also included; the same languages get subtitles.\n\nCinderella Man\n\nUnlike the first two movies in this collection, Cinderella Man has an appropriate, though not showy, score by Thomas Newman. This English 5.1 track showcases something else entirely: directional boxing sound effects and soft moment of dialogue. Each punch is crisp and clean, seemingly coming in across the sound field. When the crowd begins to cheer Braddock on, it's as if we're sitting in the middle of the ring with him, only a bit more muted than it would be in real life. Outside the boxing ring, the mix lets shifts its attention from action to moving the story forward with the dialogue.\n\nBackdraft\n\nThe only language track available here is an English 5.1 mix. While most of the film leaves a little something to be desired-especially in the area of sound mixing for dialogue scenes which follow bombastic action-anytime a fire sweeps across the sound field, it's not hard to forget about whatever other problems might be present. Flames whoosh from one side to another without distortion. The same can be said about the dialogue, except for the audio level issue. English, Spanish and French subtitles are included.\n\nA Beautiful Mind Score: 7 out of 10\n\nApollo 13 Score: 8 out of 10\n\nCinderella Man Score: 8 out of 10\n\nBackdraft Score: 7 out of 10\n\nAggregate Audio Score: 8 out of 10\n\nExtras and Packaging\n\nThe four films comes spread across eight discs; each film is housed on the first disc with the majority of the extras on the second. This set comes housed inside a sturdy book-type case. Inside is a fold out cardboard package. None of the discs are labeled \"Disc One\" or \"Disc Two.\" Instead, the extras material is labeled with a rather tiny \"Bonus Disc.\"\n\nA Beautiful Mind\n\nContinuing the direct port theme of this entire set, Universal drops every last extra from the 2001 home video version onto the two platters.\n\nFeature Commentary with Director Ron Howard\n\nDeleted Scenes with Director's Commentary\n\nMeeting John Nash\n\nA Beautiful Partnership: Ron Howard & Brian Grazer\n\nThe Process of Age Progression\n\nCasting Russell Crowe & Jennifer Connelly\n\nThose listed extras only scratch the surface of what is included. Disc One sports the feature, two commentary tracks (Howard and screenwriter Akiva Goldsman) and nearly 27-minutes worth of deleted scenes with optional commentary. Howard is the better commentator of the two with the ability to provide more production information than Goldman ever could. The writer seems to be a bit lost, particularly early on, when he decides to point out the Universal, DreamWorks and Imagine Entertainment logo's.\n\nAlso on the first disc are a dozen pages of production notes, cast and filmmaker text pages and Universal Total Axess. Don't bother throwing the disc into a computer; the DVD-ROM content consists of a media player on which to watch the movie.\n\nDisc two features eight featurettes cut from the same interview material. Everything from scoring with James Horner to Nash accepting his Nobel Prize and storyboard comparison is included. With only one segment running over ten minutes, Universal must have cut this up in order to not be on the hook for a full documentary fee. \"Inside A Beautiful Mind\", a piece running 22:32, covers much of the same ground the other features already did. A nice touch is the Best Picture footage from the Oscar ceremony. The obligatory trailer and Universal promotions are here, too. The main feature can be accessed through 20 chapter stops.\n\nApollo 13\n\nThe only extra excised from the 2005 Anniversary Edition is the \"Lost in Space\" featurette. Otherwise, everything is accounted for.\n\nLost Moon: The Triumph of Apollo 13-The Making of Apollo 13\n\nFeature Commentary with Director Ron Howard\n\nFeature Commentary with Jim & Marilyn Lovell\n\nProduction Notes\n\nTheatrical Trailer\n\nApollo 13:The IMAX Experience Version\n\nConquering Space: The Moon and Beyond\n\nLucky 13: The Astronauts' Story\n\nThe first disc sports the feature itself, \"Lost Moon,\" both commentary tracks, sixteen screens of text-based production notes and trailers for this movie and Cinderella Man. As with the previous film in the collection, Howard's commentary is the one to spend time with. He remains a talkative, knowledgeable, reverent and all together happy presence to spend time with. The Lovell's, while informative in their own right, tend to allow swaths of time to go by without comment. It gets points, though, for being a nice touch. The behind-the-scenes doc runs just under an hour and features the entire cast talking about the production. All in all, its fairly repetitive if you've already listened to the director's commentary.\n\nDisc two starts out with the shorted IMAX versions of Apollo 13; strangely, the main menu simply has a \"play\" option without actually explaining what it is. The first indication is the IMAX logo at the beginning of the film. \"Conquering Space\" chronicles the entire space program; \"Lucky 13\" is a piece from Dateline NBC from when the film debuted. The Cinderella Man trailer appears here, too. Both versions are broken down into 20 chapters.\n\nCinderella Man\n\nIn two words: too much. This film was released back in December, 2005, in what was essentially a three-disc Collector's Edition. (Disc one is a flipper.) Every single extra is replicated for this new set.\n\nFeature Commentary with Director Ron Howard\n\nDeleted Scenes with Commentary by Director Ron Howard\n\nThe Fight Card: Casting Cinderella Man\n\nThe Man, The Movie, The Legend: A Filmmaking Journey\n\nFor the Record: A History in Boxing\n\nJim Braddock: The Friends & Family Behind the Legend\n\nRussell Crowe's Personal Journey: Becoming Jim Braddock\n\nFocus on Script\n\nCreating the Reality\n\nRussell's Transformation\n\nLights, Camera, Action: The Fight From Every Angle\n\nBraddock vs. Baer Fight Footage\n\nCinderella Man Music Featurette\n\nThe Human Face of Depression\n\nTwo commentary tracks are left off the supplement listing inside the case: writers Akiva Goldsman and Cliff Hollingsworth get their own features, along with Howard. Go ahead and listen to Howard; forget the writers. Being producer and director, he is a fountain of information, again coming close to filling the nearly 150-minute running time with behind-the-scenes tidbits. (For reference, Goldsman again starts off by telling the audience which studio logo happens to be on the screen.)\n\nFlip the disc over to find twenty-one minutes worth of deleted scenes with optional director commentary. The featurettes spread across this second side and the entire \"third\" disc cover all aspects of the film, from casting to archival footage of Braddock and Baer, a photo montage, music, fight preparations and how Crowe identified with boxer. In the end, it may be \"The Human Face of the Depression\" which turns out to be the most interesting. However, it just doesn't go far enough in providing a backstory for the film. Universal should be commended, though, for bringing all the supplements from a rather limited DVD edition to the set, even if those features begin to feel monotonous; it is inexcusable, though, that only one featurette is presented in anamorphic widescreen format (\"Russell Crowe's Personal Journey\"). The extras were created for a 2005 release, a time when most home video departments have a grasp on these types of things.\n\nBackdraft\n\nRon Howard Introduction\n\nDeleted Scenes\n\nIgniting the Story\n\nBringing Together the Team\n\nThe Explosive Stunts\n\nCreating the Villain: The Fire\n\nReal-life Firemen, Real-life Stories\n\nTwo familiar themes run through these supplements: the idea we've seen them all before (from the Anniversary Edition) and that Universal didn't master a single new interview in anamorphic widescreen. Upon start up, the first disc showcases trailers for Waist Deep, Inside Man, Conviction: The Complete Series and The Blues Brothers. Hit play and Howard introduces the film; this intro is also available under the Special Features menu. Otherwise, disc one contains just over 43-minutes of deleted scenes.\n\nThe five featurettes are on disc two, four of which were cut from the same series of interviews. Howard and crew run through how the film came to be, the challenges of working with fire and a gaggle of other information. Last up is \"Real-life Firemen, Real-life Stories,\" an obligatory piece in which firefighters give their stamp of approval to film. Stacked up against something like Cinderella Man, these bonus features feel more than a bit lacking.\n\nA Beautiful Mind Score: 7 out of 10\n\nApollo 13 Score: 8 out of 10\n\nCinderella Man Score: 9 out of 10\n\nBackdraft Score: 6 out of 10\n\nAggregate Extras Score: 8 out of 10\n\nThe Bottom Line\n\nFour different movies, only two of which are any good, in an attractive package with almost every last supplement carried over from the original DVD releases."
