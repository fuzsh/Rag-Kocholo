        "text": "FIRST, A DISCLAIMER.\n\nIt would not be proper to write about Ron Howard's new movie, \"The Paper,\" a romp through 24 hours in the manic life of a New York tabloid, without noting up front that the film takes an extremely dim view of The New York Times.\n\nThe reporters at the tabloid, The New York Sun (\"It Shines for All\"), are fun, hard-working, casual types. But the uptown rival New York Sentinel, as The Times is called, is portrayed as the sort of place where snotty overbred reporters arrange themselves neatly according to a seating chart, wear bow ties and braces, cry when they miss a story and speak foreign languages into their headsets.\n\nWell, ferme ma bouche, as we like to say around here. At least Mr. Howard doesn't have us sipping iced-skim-decaf-lattes while we babble polyglottally.\n\nNo hard feelings. At least the battered business is getting the glossy Hollywood treatment. It's been a long time since Dustin Hoffman and Robert Redford brought down Richard Nixon in \"All the President's Men,\" back in 1976, or since Paul Newman outfoxed the less-than-scrupulous Miami reporter played by Sally Field in \"Absence of Malice,\" in 1981.\n\nSuddenly, newspaper movies are more of a growth industry than newspapers: \"The Paper,\" with an all-star ensemble cast headed by Michael Keaton, Glenn Close, Robert Duvall and Marisa Tomei, opens on Friday; Denzel Washington plays a Washington investigative reporter in the recent \"Pelican Brief;\" Jennifer Jason Leigh plays a hard-boiled, fast-talking reporter in \"The Hudsucker Proxy,\" which opened on Friday, and Julia Roberts and Nick Nolte play sparring and spooning newshounds for competing Chicago papers in \"I Love Trouble,\" due in June.\n\nThe new movies seem to be trying to capture some of the glamour of the old newspaper yarns, which dished up wisecracks and romance along with deadlines. Who can forget seeing that first bristling shot of Hepburn and Tracy in the 1942 film \"Woman of the Year,\" where they played an elegant political columnist and an earthy sports columnist who bump into each other in their editor's office? The actress hiked up her skirt to smooth her stocking just in time to get an appreciative look from Tracy, and art and life were off and imitating.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
