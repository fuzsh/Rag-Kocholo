        "text": "I don’t write very often, but I had to get in on Spooktober for Throwback Thursday. I’ll be reviewing two movies: the first of which is presented here, ‘Underworld.’ To be clear, it would be something of a stretch to call ‘Underworld’ a horror film. It’s much closer to a Gothic action flick (think The Matrix but with more vampires — called Vampires — and werewolves — called Lycans, presumably to be edgy), but I think it can still fit.\n\nLet’s get the worst out of the way. Vampires vs. werewolves is exhausted at this point, and while this world is a far cry from ‘Twilight,’ the latter has salted the earth and left behind a desolate, soiled territory that is hard to not recall whenever the same supernatural elements are used.\n\nThe plot, to put it mildly, does not stand up. I’m not sure that it ever did, though. There are gaping holes in both the setting plot and the backstory, and the film does go to some effort to leave things open for its somewhat unfortunate attempt at making itself into a franchise — my mind has largely blocked the two sequels I’ve seen from my memory, which I consider a blessing. Unfortunately, this attempt at backdooring setup for sequel films does somewhat diminish the original.\n\nIf you can take the plot with several grains of salt — make that a pound or two — the film does have some pretty incredible strengths, however.\n\nThe most immediate and striking is the ambiance. From the opening scene, Selene, played by a leather-clad Kate Beckinsale, gazes from a rain-drenched perch over a darkened, nameless city.\n\nOne of the primary vehicles for the ambiance is the lighting, which strikes just the perfect balance between being almost universally dark and brooding, yet bright enough to never let it be overbearing. While I know that lighting is one of the major elements of filmography, it is rarely as evident to a neophyte like me as when watching ‘Underworld.’\n\nThe action is fine. The movie came out in 2003, and the action feels decidedly early 2000s. I referenced ‘The Matrix’ (1999) earlier, and I think it reasonable to say that ‘Underworld’ tried to be part of the wake of ‘The Matrix,’ with all of the good and bad that comes with that approach. The shifting of the Lycans ages fairly well, although the pauses in the fighting feel peculiarly magical girl-esque.\n\nThe characters range in quality but are mostly compelling. Beckinsale’s Selene, in particular, is portrayed intricately: from scene to scene she is alternatively an assassin-supersoldier, a detective, a desperate daughter figure, a concerned friend, or a woman tired of being chased by a man she dislikes… and all of these fleeting portrayals manage to resonate.\n\nSaid man, Kraven, played by Shane Brolly, is played well, but the character is…well, craven, and can quickly grate. This is nowhere more true than his abusive “no means yes” attitude towards Selene. He’s hateable, but the movie also wants you to hate him.\n\nBoth of the elder figures in the film feature standout performances by the Lycan Lucian, played by Michael Sheen, and the Vampire Viktor, played by the inimitable Bill Nighy, who most readers probably know as Davy Jones from the ‘Pirates of the Carribbean’ films.\n\nUnderworld also features an unrecognizably young Wentworth Miller, who plays Michael’s medical intern friend.\n\nWhich brings us to Michael.\n\nMichael, played by Scott Speedman, is easily the weakest character in the cast. He is largely plain and uninteresting, with no meaningful backstory given. He takes few to no actions of his own volition, and is largely a vehicle through which the dubious plot moves. It is also too generous to say that he acts as the eyes of the audience into the world of the supernatural, as the story clearly centers on Selene. Speedman barely gets a chance to flex whatever acting chops he may have, although I do find much of his performance wooden and boring.\n\nPerhaps worst of all, his turn as love interest for Selene also feels contrived and lacks chemistry.\n\nLet’s speak of happier things.\n\nIn my opinion, the most impressive feat of ‘Underworld’ is the sheer amount of story it is able to tell without using dialog at all. The world-building of ‘Underworld’ is the single most significant reason I perpetually seem to return to the film. Some details are omitted — such as the name of the city in which the film takes place, which is never provided. These omissions end up becoming as significant of details as those which are included. In some ways, the namelessness of the city only builds on it.\n\nDetails like the differing cultures of the Lycans and Vampires are shown, not told, in a way which I wish many other films would learn from. This all contributes to that ambiance I spoke of earlier. While watching the film, it is difficult to not lose yourself in the world the movie builds — even as the plot plods along, I found myself only rarely getting pulled out when something really inexplicable happened.\n\nIf you’re looking for a film with spooky overtones but no jumpscares and limited danger of nightmares, ‘Underworld’ is a solid choice. It has aged well, it’s easy to get lost in, and the cast mostly makes your stay in its well-built world worthwhile (except you, Michael). Just don’t look too deeply at the plot — suspend your disbelief and enjoy the ride.\n\n‘Underworld’ is rated R for violence and some foul language, although I found most of the violence to be tame by today’s standards. It’s available for streaming on Netflix, and can be rented or bought on a host of services, notably Amazon.\n\n— — — —\n\nArianna McKee is a design editor for The Express."
