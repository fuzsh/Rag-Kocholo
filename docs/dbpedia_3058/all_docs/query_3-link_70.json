        "text": "On July 20, 1969, “the Eagle has landed” was uttered as man stepped foot on the moon.\n\nWhile the Apollo 11 mission was successful, two missions later, Apollo 13 faced many travails. Ron Howard’s 1995 film explored the aborted 1970 Apollo 13 mission. It is based on the book Lost Moon: The Perilous Voyage of Apollo 13 by astronaut Jim Lovell and Jeffrey Kluger.\n\nAstronauts Lovell, Jack Swigert, and Fred Haise aboard Apollo 13 for America’s third Moon landing mission. En route, an on-board explosion deprives their spacecraft of most of its oxygen supply and electric power, forcing NASA’s flight controllers to abort the Moon landing, and turning the mission into a struggle to get the three men home safely.\n\nThe film’s star-studded cast includes Tom Hanks, Kevin Bacon, Bill Paxton, Gary Sinise, Kathleen Quinlan, and Ed Harris. The movie was nominated for nine Oscars (Picture, Supporting Actor-Ed Harris, Supporting Actress-Kathleen Quinlan, Adapted Screenplay, Art/Set Direction, Visual Effects, Film Editing, Original Score, and Sound) and won two: Sound and Film Editing.\n\nTonight (July 20) at the CALS Ron Robinson Theater, Apollo 13 will be shown. Doors open at 6pm and the film starts at 7pm. Cost is $2. Members of the Central Arkansas Astronomical Society receive free admission.\n\nSummer nights are the perfect escape from the hot days, especially when the River Market’s outdoor film series returns to the First Security Amphitheater.\n\nMovies in the Park continues its 15th season tonight with Apollo 13.\n\nBy the time the Apollo 13 mission launched in 1970, the United States had already landed on the moon, twice. The public was no longer hanging on every detail of the manned missions to the lunar surface or every rocket the United States put into orbit. However, that changed on April 14. Following the rupture of an on-board oxygen tank, the three-man crew was forced to abort their lunar landing and focus on getting home in one piece.\n\nThis 1995 movie stars Tom Hanks, Bill Paxton, Kevin Bacon, Gary Sinise, Ed Harris, and Kathleen Quinlan. It was directed by Ron Howard. The film was nominated nine Academy Awards and won for Best Sound and Best Film Editing.\n\nFamilies, picnics, and leashed pets are invited to the park to enjoy movies under the stars, but no glass containers. Don’t forget the bug spray! An adult must accompany all children under the age of 18 and an ID is required. Chaperoned youth, sports, church and other groups are welcome! The amphitheater will open an hour before film showings (approx. 7:30) and movies with begin at sundown each week (approx. 8:30).\n\nFor more information about Movies in the Park and to see which films will feature live performances or other activities before the showings, visit www.rivermarket.info or find us on Facebook at www.facebook.com/lrrivermarket\n\nTonight you can see Andy Griffith on screen at the Old State House at 5:30. At 7pm, you can see an opus by Opie as Ron Howard’s recent film Rush is screened by the Little Rock Film Festival at the Ron Robinson Theater. (If you want to have a Mayberry weekend, you can see Griffith tonight and catch a reprise of Rush on Sunday at 7pm.)\n\nTwo-time Academy Award®-winner Ron Howard delivers the exhilarating true story of a legendary rivalry that rocked the world. During the sexy and glamorous golden age of Formula 1 racing, two drivers emerged as the best: gifted English playboy James Hunt (Chris Hemsworth, The Avengers) and his methodical, brilliant Austrian opponent, Niki Lauda (Daniel Brühl, Inglourious Basterds). As they mercilessly clash on and off the Grand Prix racetrack, the two drivers push themselves to the breaking point of physical and psychological endurance, where there’s no shortcut to victory and no margin for error.\n\nThe film reunited Howard with screenwriter Peter Morgan from Frost/Nixon.\n\nRush is rated R. Admission is $5 and concessions will be available for $1."
