        "text": "If you see A BEAUTIFUL MIND, you will understand why I made that statement. There's no comparison between the journeys of the two characters. My statement was not intended as a putdown of Maximus or of Russell's performance.\n\nI saw GLADIATOR eight times.\n\nHere's what Roger Ebert said about\n\nA BEAUTIFUL MIND:\n\nThe Nobel Prize winner John Forbes Nash Jr. still teaches at Princeton, and walks to campus every day. That these commonplace statements nearly brought tears to my eyes suggests the power of \"A Beautiful Mind,\" the story of a man who is one of the greatest mathematicians, and a victim of schizophrenia. Nash's discoveries in game theory have an impact on our lives every day.\n\n\"A Beautiful Mind\" stars Russell Crowe as Nash, and Jennifer Connelly as his wife, Alicia, who is pregnant with their child when the first symptoms of his disease become apparent. It tells the story of a man whose mind was of enormous service to humanity while at the same time betrayed him with frightening delusions. Crowe brings the character to life by sidestepping sensationalism and building with small behavioral details. He shows a man who descends into madness and then, unexpectedly, regains the ability to function in the academic world. Nash has been compared to Newton, Mendel and Darwin, but was also for many years just a man muttering to himself in the corner.\n\nDirector Ron Howard is able to suggest a core of goodness in Nash that inspired his wife and others to stand by him, to keep hope and, in her words in his darkest hour, \"to believe that something extraordinary is possible.\" The movie's Nash begins as a quiet but cocky young man with a West Virginia accent, who gradually turns into a tortured, secretive paranoid. Crowe, who has an uncanny ability to modify his look to fit a role, always seems convincing as a man who ages 47 years during the film.\n\nThe early Nash, seen at Princeton in the late 1940s, calmly tells a scholarship winner \"there is not a single seminal idea on either of your papers.\" When he loses at a game of Go, he explains: \"I had the first move. My play was perfect. The game is flawed.\" He is aware of his impact on others (\"I don't much like people and they don't much like me\") and recalls that his first-grade teacher said he was \"born with two helpings of brain and a half-helping of heart.\"\n\nIt is Alicia who helps him find the heart. She is a graduate student when they meet, is attracted to his genius, is touched by his loneliness, is able to accept his idea of courtship when he informs her, \"Ritual requires we proceed with a number of platonic activities before we have sex.\" To the degree that he can be touched, she touches him, although often he seems trapped inside himself; Sylvia Nasar, who wrote the 1998 biography that informs Akiva Goldsman's screenplay, begins her book by quoting Wordsworth about \"a man forever voyaging through strange seas of Thought, alone.\"\n\nThe movie traces his treatment by an understanding psychiatrist (Christopher Plummer), and his agonizing courses of insulin shock therapy. Medication helps him improve somewhat--but only, of course, when he takes the medication. Eventually newer drugs are more effective, and he begins a tentative re-entry into the academic world at Princeton.\n\nThe movie fascinated me about the life of this man, and I sought more information, finding that for many years he was a recluse, wandering the campus, talking to no one, drinking coffee, smoking cigarettes, paging through piles of newspapers and magazines. And then one day he paid a quite ordinary compliment to a colleague about his daughter, and it was noticed that Nash seemed better.\n\nThere is a remarkable scene in the movie when a representative for the Nobel committee (Austin Pendleton) comes visiting, and hints that he is being \"considered\" for the prize. Nash observes that people are usually informed they have won, not that they are being considered: \"You came here to find out if I am crazy and would screw everything up if I won.\" He did win, and did not screw everything up.\n\nThe film itself, to me, was mediocre... only because I desired more intricate detail of Nash's achievements and struggles, rather than Ron Howard going for the proverbial tear-jerker trying to squeeze out every possible drop of melodrama from Nash's otherwise nonexciting life. And I don't mean that as an insult...\n\nNash wasn't an \"exciting\" individual in the dramatic sense, so I'm sure that the filmmakers had to take certain liberties in telling his life story to make it more palatable for mass audiences.\n\nHowever, Howard's direction combined with Crowe's acting skill did an excellent job of depicting the aloof, eccentric nature of John Nash. Everything I've read of Nash demonstrates that he is a man who's mind exists on some plane far out of reach of most of us.\n\nIt's almost as if he's like Neo from The Matrix and sees the whole world in complex mathematical code. I do like the way they gave visual examples of that in the film... very effective.\n\nHowever, I feel the film reaches the pinnacle of coming anywhere near being able to truly define John Nash's genius in one scene:\n\nNash is in the bar with his college buddies and they're talking about scoring with women. Nash's mind suddenly goes into \"Ross Perot\" mode and we see him visualizing the possible scenarios and their outcomes.\n\nThis scene is brilliant because it explains the crux of Nash's world-renowned Equilibrium Theory for Strategic Noncooperative Games. The scene explains the magnitude of Nash's Nobel Prize-winning work so well that even a \"waste-oid\" like Bender from The Breakfast Club could grasp it.\n\nEssentially, his Equilibrium Theory, which has been applied in economics, quantum physics and even evolutionary science, took the past assumptions surrounding the probability matrix of a \"game\" (any event in which two or more individuals are competing or cooperating to achieve a certain goal, or goals) and turned them on their head. Nash's theory asserts that individual and collective goals can both be achieved if each individual does what's best for themselves, given the actions of the other individuals.\n\nI thought that this one scene made the film worth watching, even if Howard spent the rest of the film making us sniffle and go \"Aww\" every five minutes."
