        "text": "Sharing this again, apparently disagreements have entered comments... And while that may not be surprising, and could generate a good debate, I fair I have seen common components of conversational deterioration. A conversation generally centres around 4 things in my opinion: Facts Opinions Restrictive domain errors Narrative errors A restrictive domain is really a mathematical issue... using the same principles in philosophy. Which is a foundation, or a belief system that an individual exist in. This means, they have a deep belief in something and it's difficult for them to relinquish it and be open to a new way of thinking or new information. Therefore, the narrative they will create has to fit that belief system or way of thinking. Fact states that she earth is round, opinion says it's flat... The belief system is built on many things including not trusting scientists and governments. The narratives will offer examples as to why the earth is flat, and none of them are based on fact and cannot be proven. They are trapped in their beliefs and will do everything to defend it, even if it's false. It's their safe place of existence because new is threatening. That said, I would encourage everyone to watch the ever so charmingly great documentary series on Netflix, The Toys That Made Us, and do watch the Barbie story. More importantly, understand what these movies mean to the retail space and why they even make them. The argument that about Barbie representing a certain type of woman was never the foundation of the brand, and in its own right, was an innovative introduction to the toy world and offered young girls a liberating choice in life ‚Äî All dolls prior were babies and trained little girls how to be good mothers and all the garden variety societal roles. And not that anything is wrong with those roles, if a woman chooses to be any of them.\n\nIf you‚Äôre a guy and haven‚Äôt seen the Barbie movie, you should. And you should do so in a big movie theatre. Because, having seen it the first time in such a place, a remarkable thing happened: I heard some people, mostly women, sobbing. So I went back a 2nd time, to a packed matinee, to see if it would happen again. It did. At the same moment. Look, there‚Äôs a lot about this film that is over-stuffed. Worse, all subtext is song-and-danced in ALL CAPS. Fine. But all those on-the-nose scenes lead to a soliloquy that closes the second act. Mattel employee Gloria (America Ferrera) and Barbie have both fallen into existential black holes. America spontaneously delivers a rousing monologue to motivate Barbie to take back her life - and all of her friends‚Äô lives, too. This moment hits every note at the center of what women experience every day. It also serves as a cri de c≈ìur for the Barbie brand itself. Here it is in full: ‚Ä¶.. It is literally impossible to be a woman. You are so beautiful, and so smart, and it kills me that you don't think you're good enough. Like, we have to always be extraordinary, but somehow we're always doing it wrong. You have to be thin, but not too thin. And you can never say you want to be thin. You have to say you want to be healthy, but also you have to be thin. You have to have money, but you can't ask for money because that's crass. You have to be a boss, but you can't be mean. You have to lead, but you can't squash other people's ideas. You're supposed to love being a mother, but don't talk about your kids all the damn time. You have to be a career woman but also always be looking out for other people. You have to answer for men's bad behavior, which is insane. But if you point that out, you're accused of complaining. You're supposed to stay pretty for men, but not so pretty that you tempt them too much or that you threaten other women because you're supposed to be a part of the sisterhood. But always stand out and always be grateful. But never forget that the system is rigged. So find a way to acknowledge that but also always be grateful. You have to never get old, never be rude, never show off, never be selfish, never fall down, never fail, never show fear, never get out of line. It's too hard. It's too contradictory and nobody gives you a medal or says thank you! And it turns out, in fact, that not only are you doing everything wrong, but also everything is your fault. I'm just so tired of watching myself and every single other woman tie herself into knots so that people will like us. And if all of that is also true for a doll just representing women, then I don't even know. ‚Ä¶.. I did not ‚Äúenjoy‚Äù the Barbie movie. But I was mesmerized by it. Bravo Mattel. Bravo Greta Gerwig. To my Hollywood friends, if you think the best response is just to make more TOY movies, you are not paying attention to why people keep lining up for Barbie in the first place. .\n\nHere is what America Ferrera says to Barbie: \"It is literally impossible to be a woman\". \"You are so beautiful, and so smart, and it kills me that you don‚Äôt think you‚Äôre good enough. Like, we have to always be extraordinary, but somehow we‚Äôre always doing it wrong. \"You have to be thin, but not too thin. And you can never say you want to be thin. You have to say you want to be healthy, but also you have to be thin. You have to have money, but you can‚Äôt ask for money because that‚Äôs crass. You have to be a boss, but you can‚Äôt be mean. You have to lead, but you can‚Äôt squash other people‚Äôs ideas. You‚Äôre supposed to love being a mother, but don‚Äôt talk about your kids all the damn time.

It‚Äôs too contradictory and nobody gives you a medal or says thank you! \"I‚Äôm just so tired of watching myself and every single other woman tie herself into knots so that people will like us\" A lot of this resonates with me and I also hear it often when coaching other women.

It's now officially the season of the slime-green brat. You might think it's just a quick viral phase, but being 'so Julia' is actually an entire movement. Put simply - 'brat girl summer' is not just a slogan, it's a lifestyle. Brats are not afraid to break the rules and express themselves. It's about being bold, adventurous and authentic. It's about celebrating diversity, individuality and creativity. It's about having fun, challenging stereotypes, norms and expectations all while being socially conscious and politically aware. So far we've had fashion, lifestyle and beauty brands (and even politicians) tapping into their bratiness and it doesn't look like the trend is moving on anytime soon. So what learnings can #bratgirlsummer serve on communicating with #GenZ ? üëΩ Brands shouldn't be afraid to be edgy, provocative and playful (when appropriate, of course). Gen Z values brands that step out of their comfort zones and never play it safe. Having a strong brand personality is key. üëΩ Gen Z can spot a fake brat from a mile away. They want brands that are genuine, transparent and honest. If you're desperately trying to make brat girl summer happen and it's not - don't force it - they'll respect that more. üëΩ Never underestimate the power and influence of Gen Z. They are not a passive consumer group, they are active creators, collaborators and advocates. They want brands that respect their voice, listen to their feedback, and co-create with them so listen to their wants and needs. Ultimately, it's about being brat, but in a good way...\n\nLet‚Äôs talk Barbie! üíó üíµ I‚Äôm a Barbie girl -I always was; as a child I must have had at least 10 Barbies, a house, the car, the horses, huge pile of clothes, you name it. Then, we become girls without the Barbies, and we grow up becoming women, but unlike Barbie, who can be anything she wants, we don‚Äôt automatically get to be or become ‚Äúanything‚Äù, but instead we have to find our way, sometimes if not often fight our way, prove our way, find acceptance for our way, bend the society our way. It's 2024, and we keep fighting, proving, bending. Only now, we‚Äôre getting louder, and making an impact that is hard to ignore ‚Äì with money. If you think that sidelining female directors and actresses deserving of recognition is a petty issue to discuss, I‚Äôd invite you to perhaps start looking into the bigger picture of societal structures, paradigms and cultural norms so rooted in a patriarchal framework that this is imperative to start completely changing the narrative for future generations. And if you/we don‚Äôt, eventually they will. This is us paving the way for them. üí∞ It probably doesn‚Äôt come as a surprise that on the list of most sold toys of all time, Barbie is a constant top-three contestant, with a brand recognition of a whooping 99%. By 2009, 1 Billion (!) Barbies had been sold worldwide and made $3 Billion off Barbie sales altogether, and riding the wave of the 2023 blockbuster movie, Mattel‚Äôs sales of Barbie and all related merchandise skyrocketed. The Barbie movie generated more than $1.4 Billion in global ticket sales, and is the highest-grossing picture ever made by Warner Bros. üíó Why? Because every girl who once was a Barbie girl now is a mother, a woman, a grandmother, a professional, a leader. A dreamer. And they went to see the movie -creating wealth for the film studio. And they bought new Barbies -creating wealth for the toy maker. And their daughters, and sons (like mine, who at the age of 6 last summer wanted to see the Barbie movie -twice!), are dreamers, dreamers of a future where they can be anything. üíµ üí∂ The purchase power of women counts, it‚Äôs one way to vote and make change possible. The female currency is growing, slowly, but it is making an impact by ending up where women choose to invest. In a movie ticket, in a toy doll, in growth, in the stock market, in real estate, in companies, in other women. Sidelining the pioneering work of female directors is not a petty issue, even if it is, well, entertainment. Barbie was, and is, and always has been, a phenomenon of her own, but she can‚Äôt be left alone in a pink world and keep the consequences hidden from our real world. Women are now becoming anything they want to be -and managing an increasing amount of wealth and money to be reckoned with. With or without an Oscar. Come on Barbie let‚Äôs go party üíÉüí∞ #investinginwomen #femalepurchasepower #womeninbusiness #femaleinvestors #femaleentrepreneurs #femalefounders #barbiemoney #shevestments\n\nThe Barbie display box in the toy store commemorates the movie launch. How cute, huh! This entire Barbie ‚Äúwow‚Äù experience highlighted the power of advertising and marketing. Even without knowing all the details about the movie, we (the fam) were booked... double booked! ‚Äì birthday parties, friend get-togethers, it was the summer holiday movie kick-off ‚Äì everyone wanted a piece of the Barbie action. Did I personally want to watch it more than twice? Probably not. Here‚Äôs my perspective: Kids, parents, and even the dads, for a fleeting moment, united... excited - on the same page. üí™üëç Then the movie began, the instant ocean parted - awkward gender inequality was suffocating. Dad's felt a bit uneasy, perhaps queasy? The femininity was fun, but the gender message was ‚Äòslap you in the face with a wet fish,‚Äô perhaps a little heavy-handed. ü§î But we all persevered. Mum's thinking, ‚ÄòSheesh, maybe I shouldn‚Äôt have brought the kids...‚Äô ü§¶ And the kids? They adored the glitter, the sparkle, and the joyful tunes ‚Äì the dance and over-the-top pink pink pink! üíï üíû üíì üíó üíñ But, the undercurrent lingered ‚Äì the division, the not-so-subtle political hints. Empowering girls or not... divided us all. The frustrating part? We recognise it; we‚Äôve lived through it. Did we really need a movie disguised as fun fun fun to question the chasms of inequality? Final thoughts. Thank you, Barbie, for uniting and dividing us all. And thank you, marketing, for herding us and showing us up as the sheep we are - It truly showcases the power of a brand. I dare you to disagree :) - Marissa ps. not really looking for comments, just thought I'd share and get this off my chest. üòÖ #barbiethemovie #brandexperience #personalbrand #brandstand\n\nMy ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ¬Ω review of Barbie on Letterboxd https://boxd.it/5K3HaX I'll contend that anyone who comes away from this (ostensibly hilarious) social commentary believing its messaging can be distilled into something as worrisomely uncomplicated as \"patriarchy bad; women good\" might simply be repeating what they went into the movie already expecting it to say. In these cases, presuppositions allow the mind - if lobbed sideways with sufficient force - to skip across the surface of a piece of film like a stone on the surface of a pond, without any penetration of its potential depths. The filmmaker is disappointed at how little their work is genuinely enjoyed, and the viewer develops the mental equivalent of tennis elbow. So what can we find if we wade into the pink plastic swimming pool that is Greta Gerwig's Barbie? Below the surface of gender conflicts expressed in female empowerment and patriarchy (ùô£ùôöùôûùô©ùôùùôöùôß of which are held up as shining lights for the overall improvement and elevation of human society), one of the most significant themes this movie speaks to is the trap of superficiality. Barbie showers in fake water, drinks fake milk, and sports a fake smile, while Ken is surrounded by fake friends even as he attempts to surf fake waves. The parade of conveyances between Barbieland and the real world all evoke the box that Barbie dolls come in: decked in eye-catching colors, but ultimately meaningless, one-dimensional, disposable cardboard containers. This film certainly didn't strike me as \"woke\" or \"anti-men\" or any other such overly simplistic nonsense. What it did was paint an achingly accurate portrait of how deep and wide the distance is between the human heart - for men and women alike - and any sense of real meaning and purpose. Ryan Gosling's \"I'm Just Ken\" and Billie Eilish's \"What Was I Made For?\" have resonated in culture because of how they encapsulate exactly that. Barbie doesn't provide any groundbreaking insights or offer a better path forward, but for the more thoughtful movie-goer, it can at least offer a jumping off point for conversations about the things that matter.\n\nExploring the Evolution of #barbie : From #Doll to Cultural Icon üåü Barbie‚Äôs journey from toy to cultural icon is a #masterclass in #marketing. With the upcoming #barbie movie, Mattel, Inc. is attempting yet another shift in positioning. And here I am trying to give it a shot by tracing back on the journey of the start of Barbie and making Barbie an icon for the world. So, lets deep dive: üèä‚ôÄÔ∏è From mommy to wifey! In 1956, Ruth and Eliot Handler, founders of the toy company Mattel, Inc., vacationed in Switzerland with their children Barbara and Ken. While there, Ruth noticed adult dolls called Lilli, initially sold as sex toys but featuring in various outfits. This inspired her to create a new doll concept, which she named Barbie after her daughter. However, Mattel's executive team initially opposed the idea, believing parents wouldn't buy a doll with adult features for their children. To address this challenge, Ruth consulted with a psychologist and decided to position Barbie as an idealized, accomplished wife figure that young girls could aspire to become. This strategy led to the popularity of Barbie in roles like weddings. In 1961, Ken was introduced as Barbie's partner, and in 1968, the first talking Barbie was released with the catchphrase \"Let's go shopping.\" Fast forwarding to 2015 ‚è≤ Feminist criticism of Barbie was swift and strong, prompting Mattel to respond by introducing professional Barbie dolls in business attire. It wasn't until the 1980s that Mattel introduced Hispanic and Black Barbie dolls, and in 1995, an Indian Barbie wearing #ethnic clothing joined the lineup. Some adjustments were made to Barbie's unrealistic body proportions, which had long been criticized. However, Mattel, Inc. struggled to keep pace with #changing societal expectations. By 2015, Mattel had endured a decade of declining #sales , with Barbie facing allegations of negatively impacting self-esteem, contributing to eating disorders, and reinforcing #traditional gender norms. The company underwent a #leadership change, and in 2016, they introduced Barbie dolls with diverse body types, including plus-size, tall, and petite versions. A year later, the \"Imagine the Possibilities\" campaign showcased how playing with Barbie could empower girls. This multi-million dollar repositioning effort paid off, and by 2021, Mattel had rebounded to achieve $1 billion in sales. Attaching this amazing #campaign video link which went viral and #repositioned Barbie and henceforth girls to imagine themselves in any role possible is mesmerising and a great addition to brand building!
