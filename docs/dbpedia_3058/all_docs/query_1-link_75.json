        "text": "Studies in Film\n\nMs. Grymes\n\nJames Angeles\n\n6/9/15\n\nA Beautiful Mind\n\nDecember 21, 2001\n\nRon Howard\n\nA Beautiful Mind, directed by Ron Howard, garnered a lot of success by winning four Academy Awards in the year 2001. By winning categories such as Best Picture, Best Director, Best Adapted Screenplay, and Best Supporting Actress, A Beautiful Mind proved to the world that it was truly a great film. There were many factors that account for why A Beautiful Mind won at the heavily coveted Academy Award. Cinematic elements such as different camera angles, a fatalistic tone in many scenes of the movie, and fantastic costume and appearance of Russell Crowe all contribute to A Beautiful Mind’s success.\n\nHoward incorporates this technique of different camera …show more content…\n\nOne of the most astounding techniques Howard uses was in the costume of John Nash, especially the appearance of his hair. Viewers can observe that Nash’s hair was fixed in two ways, parted and put up with gel or messy hair with most of his hair falling on his forehead. In almost all of the scenes with his “clean hair”, John Nash is not noticeably experiencing the effects of schizophrenia, and does not really struggle with the mental disorder. An example of this is towards the end of the film when Nash wins the Nobel Prize. Nash’s hair is quite fixed up and parted to symbolize that Nash has successfully fought off the effects of schizophrenia. On the other hand, not coincidentally, when Nash has “messy hair”, he is in utter distress from schizophrenia. An example of this is shown when Nash is fighting with Agent Parcher outside of the Princeton building. His hair's all messed up and he screams at Parcher, obviously greatly affected by schizophrenia. Howard also utilizes actual clothes of Nash to show the states of stress experienced by Nash. When Nash has his life together, viewers see Nash with rather elegant apparel such as a suit and tie or a collared shirt. This is accentuated in the scene at the Ball. In this scene, Nash is seen with a black and white tux with a black bowtie. This part is also one of the best examples of Nash when he is not affected by schizophrenia. On the other hand, in Nash’s worst fight with schizophrenia, is seen with only pajamas and a plain sweater. The chaos caused by schizophrenia led Nash to actually hurting his wife Alicia. This was the lowest part for John Nash. Ron Howard effectively uses elements of mise-en-scene to create a better"
