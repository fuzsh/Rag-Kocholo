        "text": "“The Shining” is a great movie about obsessive behavior, namely that of Jack Torrance, the writer played by Jack Nicholson who slowly loses his mind while holed up in a snowed-in hotel with his family over a winter.\n\nBut even Jack may not be as obsessed as some of the people who study him and his movie. They’re well-chronicled in “Room 237,” Rodney Ascher’s terrific documentary in which “Shining” obsessives espouse various theories telling us what the movie was really about.\n\nBy its nature, obsession makes great movie fodder. It certainly plays a key role in these 10 movies.\n\n“Taxi Driver” (1976): Martin Scorsese’s brutal masterpiece finds Robert De Niro at his best, as the driver of the title who becomes intent on cleaning up the sleaze he sees around him in New York (one day a real rain is going to fall), and then obsessed with the assassinating a presidential candidate. A classic, of course.\n\n“The Conversation” (1974): Or, what Francis Ford Coppola did in his spare time while not busy with “The Godfather: Part II.” BOTH were nominated for best picture in the same year. In this, Gene Hackman plays Harry Caul, a surveillance expert who believes something he overheard will lead to murder. He becomes obsessed with figuring out exactly what is going on, turning this into one of the best studies of paranoia ever put on film.\n\n“Close Encounters of the Third Kind” (1977): It’s probably when Richard Dreyfuss starts building a sculpture of a rock formation out of mashed potatoes that we realize he is truly obsessed with his encounter with something unexplained, right? Steven Spielberg’s strange film about alien contact rewards repeated viewings. And once you get those five musical notes in your head, they’re there forever.\n\n“Fatal Attraction” (1987): Obsession? Uh, you think? Glenn Close has a one-night stand with Michael Douglas, which is all he wants. She wants a little ... more. She goes nuts, obsessed with having him. If you consider boiling a rabbit nuts. Which most people would.\n\n“Misery” (1990): The thing that’s so great about Kathy Bates’ performance as a woman obsessed with a writer (James Caan), who she holds hostage after he wrecks his car near her house, is that it’s as funny as it is terrifying. Sometimes simultaneously. That’s a difficult trick, one Bates pulled off with seeming ease and was rewarded with an Oscar. Oh, and if you’re interested, in the book she doesn’t break his foot. She cuts it off. So, you know. Extra ouch.\n\n“Raiders of the Lost Ark” (1981): Maybe Harrison Ford’s Indiana Jones is obsessed with relics or something, but the real obsession in Steven Spielberg’s rollicking nod to Saturday afternoon serials is the Nazis’ obsession with finding the Ark of the Covenant (see: title). That’s the kind of obsession that can get your face melted.\n\n“The Cable Guy” (1996): Hard to say who was more obsessive, Jim Carrey’s cable repairman who wants, desperately, to befriend Matthew Broderick, or Carrey’s fans who were put off by his disturbing performance. Not a great movie, by any means, but one of Carrey’s earlier attempts at stretching beyond his rubber-faced maniacal brand of comedy.\n\n“Single White Female” (1992): Bridget Fonda places an ad looking for a roommate. Jennifer Jason Leigh responds. Big mistake. Leigh’s character doesn’t just want to be like Fonda’s. She wants to be her, period. Creepy stuff, just crazy enough to remain realistic. It’s the kind of thing at which Leigh really excels. So why don’t we see more of her these days?\n\n“Black Swan” (2010): Natalie Portman plays Nina, a young woman who is going to dance the lead in “Swan Lake” if it kills her. Uh, OK. ... Director Darren Aronofsky’s film captures the obsessive devotion familiar to many artists, and Portman won an Oscar. Also, Mila Kunis is good at being crazy. If, in fact, she is. Or if any of the weirdness is real. Lot of unanswered questions in this film, and that’s a good thing.\n\n“American Beauty” (1999): Older guys obsessing over teenage girls never works out. Hadn’t Lester Burnham, Kevin Spacey’s character in Sam Mendes’ Oscar-magnet effort, ever read “Lolita?” Whatever the case, Spacey is great as a man whose life is falling apart and who latches onto the absolute worst things to try to keep it together (including one of his daughter’s classmates). Annette Bening is also fantastic as his cheating, shallow wife. Not exactly a traditional love story, you might say."
