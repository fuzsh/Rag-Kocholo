        "text": "Noxiously racist film. Anyway I watched this because Val Kilmer is in it, so all I'm going to do is post a section from his memoir.\n\nOne way or the other, Americans have to deal with the West and its glorious, sordid, and sadistic past. Marlon [Brando] knew that the West represents both our territorial salvation and our mortal sin, our gain and our greed. We fought lawlessness to create an even more lawless law, one that excused and perpetuated genocide. Even today, this gun-obsessed nation that we love remains enmired in a dilemma centered on pistols and rifles with romantic ties to our murderous past. We love Westerns. We learn everything from Westerns and yet learn nothing from them. We continue killing ourselves in unconscionable ways.\n\nThis slow burn western from Ron Howard is well worth your time. It stays in the same veins of classic westerns but able to make it's own way too. Just like most hollywood westerns it concerns with the conflict between Red Indians and early settlers, and the story has some magic in it.\n\nCate Blanchett plays a rancher and doctor living a quiet peaceful life with her two daughters until one day a group of deserters Apache Indians kidnapped one of her children (Evan Rachel Wood). At the same time her father (Tommy Lee Jones) who had abandoned the family and started living as an indian a long long time ago shows up and the two reunite and start aâ€¦\n\nIt's like \"The Searchers\" was directed by Ron Howard. So, everything is pretty \"Hollywood\" by today's standards. There is no sense of danger, things look great but are just too easy and comfortable. I don't have doubts that things will be alright and therefore there is no risk.\n\nI do like some of Ron Howard's films. I love \"A Beautiful Mind\" for example (although many people roll their eyes when hearing about that film), but some of his films are just too \"Hollywood\". I like my westerns to be gritty I think and this one was too clean.\n\nBut the acting, was just wow. Cate Blanchett never made a bad role, I believe! I'm still getting impressed by her.\n\nRon Howard (the very definition of a hack) really thought he had a Best Picture candidate on his hands. For this makes no sense as anything other than a prestige grab. There's no way it was going to make a nickel.\n\nStarts out as a \"hey, let's tweak THE SEARCHERS\" thing, but then turns into one of the most alarmingly racist pictures you've ever seen. It's vile. Evidently just a short 20 years ago, studios felt they could still get away with funding a grotesque fantasy of brutal \"savages\" ravaging white frontier women. Beyond the pale.\n\nThis western fantasy is mostly awesome, but has some horrifically glaring flaws.\n\nThe cast is incredible. The story is compelling. The scenes are memorable.\n\nBut the plot *astonishingly* relies on the terrible decisions of children. Like major swaths of the movie. The stupidity required to advance the story is actively frustrating.\n\nStill, generally watchable!"
