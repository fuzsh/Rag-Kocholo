        "text": "Obamacare is still the law of the land, but the Trump administration and Republicans in Congress are determined to undermine the law in the hope it will cease to function. One of the strategies is to cut advertising funding for ACA insurance plans. If a recent study is any indication, that strategy might work. One of the key components of Obamacare, you see, was creation of a marketplace where people could shop for (often subsidized) insurance plans. The success of this marketplace depends on bringing in enough customers, especially relatively healthy ones, to cover the cost of caring for people with expensive illnesses. Advertising is key in bringing customers to this marketplace. Under the Obama administration, this advertising budget exceeded $100 million a year. President Trump is cutting the budget 90%.\n\nWill less advertising mean fewer customers?\n\nIn a study led by Sarah Gollust from the University of Minnesota, researchers looked at ACA television advertising volume across the country in 2014, counting the number of adds airing during local television news shows across the country. They counted federally and locally funded \"You can shop for insurance\" ads, as well as political ads, many of which were designed to sour people on the ACA. They found strong evidence of the link between ads and behavior. Here is a picture of their results:\n\nIt still astonishes me that a politically moderate health reform plan that promotes insurance markets - markets, people, markets! - is being undermined by a purportedly pro-market political party. If the Obamacare insurance market collapses now, Republicans will be to blame. It should not have to be that way."
