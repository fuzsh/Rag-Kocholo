        "text": "This podcast offers a brilliant array of different content, and styles, of episodes. The first page reviews are great at seeing how you can improve and polish a piece of writing, the depth and consideration (and humour) Tim puts into them is significant - writers can really learn a lot from his approach. Whatâs more, if you read his books, like The Honours, you can see the echos of his advice in action his own writing, which gave me an extra level of enjoyment in reading. Then there are the author chats, which give insights into difference genres and careers, and are so much more practical than broad sheet interviews with writers. Next, there are the writing challenge episodes, which I have only just started, but seem fun and easy to fit into day. I think some of the most extraordinary episodes though are Timâs writing rambles, where you have an hour of more of Tim thinking aloud on writing, publishing, mental health, novels that everyone thinks are great but are they really (Never Let Me Goâ¦looking at you), genre writing, editing, drafts, etc etc. I donât think Iâve listened to anything like these before, they are remarkably raw and honest, it really is quite affecting to listen to someone forming their thoughts in your own ears so to speak. I think it is this part that has prompted what re-reading sounds an awfully gushy review, but there we go, Iâll stick with it. Such a good find this podcast.\n\nIâve just completed the 8 week creative writing course during lockdown. I had no aspirations to write a novel; it was intended as a fun family activity for 10-20 minutes a day.\n\nWe all really enjoyed ourselves and are inspired to continue in one form or another. Two out of the four of us are now planning to write novels, which I find amazing. All of us have found a hidden, creative aspect to our talent which we can develop.\n\nPlease try this podcast/course: Tim is a great teacher and it takes little time and commitment."
