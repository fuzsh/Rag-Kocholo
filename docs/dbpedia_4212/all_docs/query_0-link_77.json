        "text": "THREE local Chinese tourists were harrumphing their way down the mountain, indignantly complaining about what they had seen. I was heading up and paused to let them pass on the trail, so one of them advised me helpfully, ''No point in going on. There's nothing there but a rock.''\n\nHmmmm. Well, yes. But what a rock!\n\nThe Yangshan Stone Tablet, in the hills outside the old capital of Nanjing in southeastern China, is not on most tourist itineraries, and even many Chinese living in Nanjing do not know about it. And yes, I suppose it is just a rock.\n\nThe site is an old imperial quarry, nestled in a series of rolling green hills, covered with forests and occasional tombs of Chinese notables. The Emperor Yongle, who ruled in the early 15th century, wanted to have the grandest monument imaginable for the tomb of his father, the founder of the Ming Dynasty. So he ordered the construction in this quarry of a headstone in three parts -- base, stele and cap. It was to be the biggest memorial in the world.\n\nCourt engineers found an appropriate spot in the quarry and designed a tablet that would have been 256 feet high. Thousands of workers spent years clearing the hillside and carving the stone from the mountain.\n\nAfter huge expense and unimaginable labor, the three parts were chiseled almost entirely free from the mountain. Then the engineers began to think of how they were going to move the tablet to the gravesite.\n\nThe tablet weighs 31,000 tons, and even today there is probably no way it could be budged. It would be far too heavy for trucks, even if there were roads to the area.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
