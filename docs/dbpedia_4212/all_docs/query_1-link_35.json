        "text": "The latest podcast of Ari Whitten’s covers corporate capture of science, ideological bias, glyphosate, golf courses, war chemicals, and myriad other topics that stimulated my thinking process in new ways. I learned for the first time (or perhaps remembered again) that the reason glyphosate causes gluten sensitivity, is because not our genes, but the genes of our microbiome use the shikimate pathway for digestion, and glyphosate disrupts that pathway. As noted in the quote above, Dr. Hendlin preaches a message of hope with communities working together. https://theenergyblueprint.com/yogi-hendlin/?inf_contact_key=f495036b257305b515a3a89958443395121216c3a82d754a88f6751e8a28a7b5\n\nSpecial Gratitude this week\n\nThe week is a kaleidoscope of memories of the farm staff working to tame the agricultural beast. My special gratitude this week goes to the Tuesday crew who worked non-stop through the pouring rain for over an hour. But we got the soybeans weeded – Jason, Paula, Em, Luke and Clare.\n\nWhat is in your CSA Share this week?\n\nLast week’s share\n\nBest guess\n\nKale\n\nCollards\n\nSwiss chard\n\nlettuce\n\nsugar snaps\n\nshell peas\n\nsummer squash\n\ncucumbers for some\n\nBasil\n\nTulsi\n\nOregano\n\nChives\n\nGarlic\n\nMaybe some other things . . .\n\nWe are still taking new shareholders – here is where you can sign up — https://mhof.net/csa-order-form/\n\nI am aware that some of you flower share folks are beginning to wonder if we are going to pull off your 10 weeks of flowers. They are weeded and seaweeded, and the glorious ornamental sunflowers are soon to pop. Bear with us. We will either provide your flowers or issue a refund of some sort at the end if we don’t meet commitments.\n\nVolunteering at MHOF\n\nCome join us! We can absorb your help like a new sponge absorbs water.\n\nCarlos and Star were back on Friday. What a blast we had!\n\nShantel, a long-term Saturday volunteer, is spending 4 days of her 2 week vacation working for us!\n\nTurkeys\n\nMy favorite birds of all arrived on the farm Thursday. Jack made his annual pilgrimage to Bob’s Turkey farm in Lancaster. They are doing well – delightful birds. It is not too early to order your Thanksgiving turkey.\n\nhttps://mhof.net/turkey/\n\nHarriet loves the turkeys\n\nItems that you can buy for your own food preservation\n\nStarting now we will have some crops in enough abundance that you can buy them in quantity for preserving for your use in the next year. We now have kale at $3/lb. It is of exceptional quality, and is one of those superfoods.\n\nWatch our kale preservation video on YouTube.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1VUTjpnwM8&t=37s\n\nJennifer’s recipe for the week\n\nKohlrabi & Cucumber Sorghum Salad\n\nOur digestive fires go down in the summer, all the more reason to eat in season as Mother Nature provides what we need in the moment. Sorghum is an ancient Indian grain that is gluten-free, is packed with protein, fiber and iron. It is easy to digest. It is light yet filling. It has the sweet, astringent, and bitter tastes which are all cooling. Paired with kohlrabi, cucumbers and lime, which are cooling as well, this makes a perfect summer salad.\n\nIngredients:\n\n1 cup Sorghum, cooked according to package instructions\n\n1 medium Cucumber, bite size pieces\n\n1 cup chopped Snap peas\n\n1 cup Kohlrabi, thinly sliced or zoodled (summer squash is an alternative)\n\n1/2 cup chopped Green Onions\n\n2 fresh Garlic Cloves, crushed\n\n1 cup fresh herbs chopped: parsley, basil and tulsi\n\nDried herbs:\n\n1 teaspoon onion powder\n\n1 teaspoon Oregano\n\n1 Lime, juiced\n\n1/2 cup Olive Oil\n\n1/4 cup Apple Cider Vinegar\n\nOptional:\n\nAvocado slices\n\nPumpkin seeds\n\nBalsamic glaze\n\nTo make:\n\nCombine all ingredients and stir well.\n\nMay be eaten right away or chilled.\n\nFarm Doins\n\nI ended this week feeling a bit more anxious than I began it. The incessant rain and then heat keeps us scurrying from one crop to another, even in our well mulched areas, like the spring onions, trying to beat the weeds. These onions have been completely taken over by bindweed (perennial morning glory) and I have decided to pull them all and put them in the barn to dry, mow and tarp the beds and hope we can kill some of the bindweed.\n\nThursday was a memorable day in that we weeded and did some seaweeding of the basil, tulsi, eggplant, melons, peppers and young Brussels sprouts. Tuesday we weeded soybeans, and finished weeding and mulching the sweet potatoes. Speaking of bindweed – definitely public enemy number 1, followed by grass in a close second, we almost daily spend 5 minutes in the newly names Clare Caldwell hoop house pulling bind weed so that it won’t take over the tomatoes therein.\n\nDuring CSA we weeded and seaweeded dill, cilantro,\n\ncucumbers, some of the basil and tulsi, seaweeded the pole beans – now looking great and ready for a later but strong season of beans.\n\nOf course we mowed, Luke foliared 3 mornings at 6:30, the entire farm, Jim cut some hay and mowed around fruit trees (though we never got a chance to rake the hay), and we did a final shake shake of the peach trees to get them thinned. Sadly, one of our peach trees split in half on Thursday, regardless of the thin. Saturday’s crew weeded and seaweeded all of the blueberries and ¾ of the grapes in the annex (where the pigs live), and Jack and I picked berries after hours each evening.\n\nJason successfully finished his first week of employment this week and will be working full-time starting today.\n\nThe seaweed is taking time to spread, though we made it through some number of tons this week. I am hoping it is an investment in the farm’s future resilience. I am pretty sure that the extended pea season is directly correlated to seaweed.\n\nWith nothing to fix this week, Danny ran the seaweed crew on Monday (we broke a chicken house the next day, however).\n\nSlugs and snails continue to plague us and the potato beetles have done some damage on the eggplants and potatoes.\n\nAnother late in the day activity is food preservation. This week we preserved lots of left over kohlrabi, more peas and sugar snaps, and some squash puree for our upcoming soups.\n\nI haven’t yet decided what to do with the leeks and parsley that are very weedy, but want to prioritize the first planting of cabbage and the early Brussels sprouts for weeding this week – fingers crossed with some more very hot weather coming up this week.\n\nAnd we need to plant some lettuce, cabbage, cauliflower and chard.\n\nSkippy, Dingo and Harriet kept watch each night and no new deer damage was noted.\n\nI almost didn’t write this week – the pressure of the season feeling a little too oppressive, but we are already halfway through July and things should start to slow in another 2-3 weeks. . . . . This is the time of year when I vow never to be so busy next year!\n\nJulie\n\nQuick Links\n\nBuy meat\n\nCSA pick up information\n\nContact Julie\n\nProducts available right now at the farm\n\nBecome a working shareholder\n\nDonate to the MHSC\n\nLinks Workshops"
