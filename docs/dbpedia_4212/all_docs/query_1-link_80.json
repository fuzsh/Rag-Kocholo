        "text": "The works worth nearly £40,000 will cover streets in the Halliwell area where people had been feeling unsafe because of the lack of light.\n\nBut the area’s representatives say they hope brightening the streets will deter crime and help people feel safer.\n\nCllr Safwaan Patel, of Halliwell, said: “What we’ve done is we’ve release what we’ve been spending on over the last 12 months so people can actually see what their council tax is being spent on.”\n\nHe added: “Of course we’ve had 14 years of austerity, it’s been death by 1000 cuts.\n\n“So for us it really was about doing something that’s going to be permanent and which benefits the whole community because walking around some of those areas it really has been pitch black.”\n\nThe new street lighting is set to be brought in around Back Crumpsall Street, Back Lena Street, Back Draycott Street and Back Drayton Street.\n\nThis will cost £39,144.20 paid for out of a one-off allocation of £50,000 made by Bolton Council as part of Halliwell’s Area Working Budget from May last year to March this year.\n\nAccording to council documents, the remaining £10,855.80 of this allocation was spent on repairs to the carriageway on Back Halliwell Road.\n\nCllr Patel says he and his colleagues Cllr Rabiya Jiva and former Cllr Kevin Morris decided to use the money for new street lighting after hearing concerns from Halliwell residents.\n\nALSO READ: Work being done to keep people safe in town centre as rape investigation continues\n\nALSO READ: New streetlights installed in town centre to improve safety\n\nALSO READ: Funding granted to light up Bolton town centre\n\nHe said: “There’s the area behind (now closed) Lloyds Bank where there have been quite a few concerns about crime and we had an incident where someone was attacked down there.”\n\nHe added: “We’ve also had areas where there have been concerns about drug dealers where because its dark they can’t be seen.”\n\nCllr Patel said that he hoped that improving the lighting and setting out how public money was being spent would help reassure people that action was being taken.\n\nHe said: “It’s about being open and honest with people, which was one of our commitments, we’re going to show people what we’re doing.”"
