        "text": "As a Library Graduate Trainee, one of my many duties is to learn about the conservation of the collections.\n\nDelving into a lesson about the history of paper from our Senior Conservator, Jonathan Farley, I became interested in exploring the various uses of paper.\n\nThe invention of paper in China\n\nInstructed by the Emperor of China to find an inexpensive and portable writing surface, the Chinese government official Ts’ai Lun produced and recorded a technique for the mass manufacture of paper during the Han Dynasty (206 BC to AD 220). Apart from the conventional use of paper as a form of writing material for Chinese scholars, it was also used to preserve the flavour of tea.\n\nAnother type of material originating in China is rice paper. It is a common misconception that rice paper is made from rice or ‘true’ paper. It is made by cutting thin sheets spirally from the inner soft core, or pith, of the stems of the plant Tetrapanax papyrifer. Rice paper became increasingly popular for watercolour paintings and the woodblock printing of birds, butterflies and costumes. An article from Preprints from the Contributions to Kyoto Congress (1988) on ‘The conservation of Far Eastern art’, states that pith paper’s excellent absorption of colour was attributed to its appearing to have a cellular, non-fibrous structure under a microscope. Kate Colleran mentions in her dissertation, ‘The Chinese call it the gauze of the Gods’, that, due to its absorbent quality, pith paper was frequently used in Taiwan and South China for medicinal purposes such as dressing wounds.\n\nDecorative paper of Japan\n\nThe book by Meher McArthur, The arts of Asia : materials, techniques, styles, describes the history of paper in Asia for the purposes of decorative letter writing, wrapping and presenting gifts. It is known that, in the time of the samurai warriors, exchanged gifts were adorned with noshi, a white paper folded with strips of dried abalone or meat as a way of wishing the recipient plentiful good fortune. McArthur suggests that items made of origami (folded paper) or cut out of paper were significant in religious rituals.\n\nLooking at the 750 beautifully unique samples of Japanese paper in the 12-volume book Washi : the soul of Japan, it is interesting to find references that monks would wear shifu (cloth woven from paper threads) or kamiko (cloth made of paper) to purify themselves. It is said that kami, the Japanese word for paper, has the same pronunciation as the word for a higher being or god, because pure white paper was associated with holiness and sacred places in Japanese Shinto religion.\n\nModern times\n\nThe decorative nature of origami and washi are still ingrained in Japanese culture today, with a very lucrative gift-wrapping culture involved in purchasing gifts and high-end luxury items. Jonathan Farley, Senior Conservator at the Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew, states in his article, ‘Paper, its past, present and potential’ in Curtis’s Botanical Magazine, that ‘the use of paper for packaging and gifts like this accounts for 45% of the world sales in the consumption of paper’.\n\nEntries in Kew’s Archives highlight people’s interest in papermaking and the use of alternative plant sources for paper during the First World War. Many fascinating stories from our Library, Art & Archives and Economic Botany collections, such as the paper seed packets used to collect plants during this period, will be on display in our commemorative exhibition, Plants, People and the Products of War: a Centenary Tribute."
