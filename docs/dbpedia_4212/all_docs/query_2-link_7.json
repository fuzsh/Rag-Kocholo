        "text": "\"Death By A Thousand Cuts\" is the tenth track from American singer and songwriter Taylor Swift's seventh studio album, Lover, released on August 23, 2019, through Republic Records.\n\nBackground[]\n\nIn an interview with NPR Music, Swift said: \"Over the course of the years that I’ve done interviews, which is probably about 15 or 16 years now, I’ve gotten a question over and over again that I think has the potential to seriously deteriorate my mental health. The question is, 'What will you ever do if you get happy? Like, what will you write about? Will you just never be able to write a song again?' It’s an interesting question. In interviews, when I would get that question as a young person, I’d kind of be like, 'Well, I started out writing songs about stuff that I had no idea about. I started writing songs when I was 12 years old, and they were usually about heartbreak. I had no idea what I was talking about, but I watched movies and I read books, so I would grab inspiration from character dynamics, as you do,' so, I would say in interviews, 'I’d probably just do that. If stuff is going on in the world that’s not just happening to me, maybe I could get inspiration from that.' But then, I’d go home and I’d be like, 'What would happen if I was ever happy? Would I not be able to do the thing that I love the most in the world? Would I not be able to write break-up songs anymore? I love break-up songs! They’re so fun to write!' So, then, I happened to be writing this album, Lover, which is a very, very happy and romantic album. In my life, a few of my friends were going through break-ups and we were talking, it’s those kinds of break-ups where you need to talk to your friend all the time, because they need to talk about it all day, every day. So, I was having a lot of conversations about break-ups, I watched movies that were really well done about break-ups, in some of the books I was reading there were some good break-ups happening, so this all culminated in me waking up one day with all these heartbreak lyrics in my head and I was like, 'It’s still here! Yes!', so I ended up writing a song that was a break-up song on the Lover album and I was like, 'This song is my proof that I don’t have to stop writing songs about heartache and misery' which, for me, is incredible news.\"\n\nIn an interview with Apple Music, Swift elaborated on the matter further: \"I love writing more than anything I’ve ever done in my life, so it was like, 'If I was in a place where I had things to protect and a world to protect, because I’m very protective of certain elements of my life and my world, would that kind of mute me a bit as a writer?' And the answer is no, actually, because there are songs [on Lover] that are not all happy, joyful songs, there are songs about moments of conflict and complexity within a relationship, there are songs that I didn’t even write about what I was going through. There’s a song called 'Death by a Thousand Cuts' that’s the most emotional, sad lyric I’ve written in a very long time, and it’s about stuff that my friends were going through, it’s about a movie character dynamic I saw. I’m happy that, thus far, the songwriting faucet has still been on and hasn’t dried up.\"\n\nLyrics[]\n\nLive performances[]\n\n\"Death by a Thousand Cuts\" was performed as part of the City of Lover concert in Paris. Swift performed it as a surprise song on the Eras Tour in Arlington, Texas, on April 1, 2023. It was performed as a surprise song a second time on August 5, 2023, in Los Angeles, and a third time in Singapore on March 7, 2024, mashed-up with \"Babe\".\n\nTrivia[]\n\nOn the Elvis Duran Show, Swift revealed that the Netflix film Someone Great inspired the song.[1]"
