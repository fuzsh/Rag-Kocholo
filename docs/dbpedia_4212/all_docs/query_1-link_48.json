        "text": "Sales people, as part of their activities to close a deal, do negotiations. From simple to complex deals Sales People will do this. During the course of the sales process however negotiation sometimes becomes bargaining activities. Some say these two terms are the same but they are actually different. The terms \"negotiate\" and \"bargain\" are often used interchangeably in the sales world, but they can have nuanced differences: Negotiate in Sales: 1. Process: Negotiating in sales refers to the overall process of reaching an agreement between a seller and a buyer. This process includes discussing various aspects of the sale, such as price, terms, delivery, and additional services or products. 2. Scope: Negotiations in sales can cover a wide range of topics beyond just the price, including payment terms, warranties, customization, volume commitment, time commitment and post-sale support. Sales people will use all these points/elements to make a win-win situations and close the negotiation 3. Longer-Term Relationship: Sales negotiations often aim to establish a longer-term business relationship between the parties. It's not just about the immediate transaction but also considering future interactions. 4. Win-Win: Effective sales negotiations often strive for a win-win outcome where both the seller and the buyer feel they are getting a fair deal and value from the transaction. Bargain in Sales: 1. Specific Action: Bargaining in sales is a more specific action within the negotiation process. It typically refers to haggling over the price or terms of the sale. For example, a buyer might try to get a discount on the listed price. 2. Price Focus: Bargaining in sales often centers on price reduction or getting additional items or services at a lower cost. It may not necessarily address other aspects of the sale in as much detail. 3. Transaction-Oriented: Bargaining can be more transactional and short-term in nature. It's about reaching an agreement for the immediate purchase rather than establishing a long-term relationship. In summary, while both negotiating and bargaining are part of the sales process, negotiating encompasses a broader range of discussions and considerations, including long-term relationships and various terms of the sale. Bargaining, on the other hand, typically refers to the specific action of haggling over price or immediate transactional details. In sales, both elements are crucial for reaching mutually satisfactory agreements with customers. Which one do you do the most? Have you negotiated more or do bargaining more?\n\nSalespeople: Here's the worst thing you can do when negotiating: Start negotiating on price before it's the \"last issue.\" Let's say your buyer starts pushing you on price. If you both agree to a price then and there - will it close the deal? Or are there other steps they still need to take? If there are other steps to take, you're negotiating too early. And you're begging for a race to the bottom on price. Never negotiate price until it's the final issue. (and no, future guy in the comments, this is not the same thing as \"don't reveal price until the end of the sales cycle.\" Different topic). P.S. Here's 39 sales questions that will set you up to win more deals and negotiate with ease: https://lnkd.in/g-VRcCsq\n\nYour customer will have savvy negotiators who work to get the very best deal for their organization. They might pit two vendors against each other, attempting to drive down the price and negotiate better terms. They know all about your month-end, quarter-end, and year-end deadlines… and how salespeople are driven to complete deals within those timeframes. But customers buy on their timeframe, not yours. Incentives you throw out don’t matter. Deadlines to buy don’t matter. That great deal with a deadline attached will still be available after that date passes. No matter what, your deal won’t happen if they aren’t ready to buy. Your customers will keep asking for concessions until you let them know that you are done negotiating. For every customer “ask,” be prepared to say “no” three times to signal to the customer that it is time to move forward. ++++++++++++++++ Mitchell led his sales team on a highly competitive pursuit with a prospective customer. Mitchell’s team had very good exposure with the decision-makers, and his team presented an excellent value proposition that the customer agreed was achievable. After multiple discussions with significant back-and-forth, the deal remained open. Then Mitchell received a call from the customer’s CFO, who said, “We like your solution, but not your price.” Mitchell held firm and then stated calmly, “Then, I guess you don’t really like our solution or the business value you agreed you would achieve. What we provided was our best and final offer.” The CFO responded with, “Does that mean there are no more discounts?” Mitchell confirmed that no more discounts would be offered. The response: “I’m the CFO, so I have to ask. Let’s get the contract signed and get started.” What does this demonstrate? No one buys anything as long as the price keeps going down!\n\nHere are 3 things you can do during a sales cycle to increase your win rate: 1. Don't just build a champion, but test them. → Ask them to get higher ups on the call → Ask them to nudge procurement/legal to move faster → Get them to get legal involved early on in the process → Ask them to get a call scheduled with the right people on your behalf → Give them a reverse timeline to follow and ensure they're hitting the milestones 2. Find the person that isn't a fan and neutralize them. → Understand why they're not a fan (usually bc a competitor) → Leverage the reasons they're not a fan to trap set. For example if they like a competitor, ask how they plan to solve for [X] challenge with the competitor. (This assumes you know the competitor can't solve for it). 3. Don't negotiate early → My largest deals have the smallest discount → Don't wiggle on your price until you're the chosen vendor If you use a pricing discount in the beginning, you're literally just competing with your own paycheck and not trying to build value. You're just trying to sell the cheapest offering. If you can do these three things really well, you'll make more money.\n\nFebruary sales was a bit of a struggle for me. Not that I didn’t try, I explored every possible opportunity. What I’m seeing in a lot of customers is what I call the corporate thumb hold. The customers I deal with directly to keep their trucks going are being directed by someone in their corporate office in another state on who they can buy from. This direction usually comes after someone takes someone to dinner or a weekend somewhere. Even though we may have a better product, a better price, and availability, they might have to wait days on getting the parts they need from that said directed vendor. In the meantime if my figures are still current, that company is losing an average on that downed truck of $1650 a day. You ask who is that company? There are dozens and it seems to be getting worse everyday. The techs working on these trucks get frustrated because they can’t get the parts to get their job done. Then you have some dispatcher wanting to know why they don’t have a truck for a load. It’s a domino effect. Meanwhile someone at corporate who made this decision is looking at financials wondering why things are down. So if you’re one of those guys directing where your company can buy, you might want to visit that terminal and talk to the guys helping make your company money. In the meantime I will continue to visit those customers and present quality products with quality prices, and continue the relationships I built. It’s time to fix what’s broken. America.\n\nTop 5 reasons why Sellers lose deals. Sellers, and those in sales positions, invest in building relationships with Procurement and not just the end user. It’s easy to think that buying coffee for an end user, and smoozing a decision maker over a cold beverage is enough but it is not. You lose sales deals for several reasons but here are the top 5 reasons you fail to close deals that are totally avoidable. 1️⃣ You tried to close too early. 2️⃣ You’ve not engaged the decision maker. 3️⃣ You did not ask enough questions. 4️⃣ You failed to identify hidden objections. 5️⃣ You were too desperate. It’s easy to blame others when we lose a deal. We blame pricing. That the buyer had it in for you. That they’d already made a decision. But truth is, if you manage to get in front of a buyer you did have an opportunity to persuade them that your offering is their right choice. Asking more questions will help you identify objections and prevent you from trying to close too early. Get access to all parties involved in the decision making process and when you come across ‘guardians’ explain to them that it’s important you do well so their business can do well. Exclusive is not inclusive.\n\nNegotiating is my favorite part of sales. It’s exciting to have a prospect wanting your product or service and finding a way to negotiate what’s best for you and your company, but also for the individual or business buying. The most important thing about negotiation is to not start negotiating until your prospect is sold. I’ve lost deals over being too eager to negotiate. You have no leverage if you negotiate too early. You discount, offer a free add-on, whatever it may be, and it doesn’t move the needle at all. A great way to make sure your prospect is sold and it’s a good time to start negotiation? Ask - “Are we at a point where we just need to agree on price or terms, and we’re ready to go?” Make sure you ask the right questions before playing all your cards and discounting. Keep things close until they are sold. Then have fun negotiating and getting the deal done! What are your biggest tips or tricks when it comes to negotiating? #sales #negotiating #closing"
