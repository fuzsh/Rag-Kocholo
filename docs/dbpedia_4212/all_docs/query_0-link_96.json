        "text": "Feb 19, 2021 © Ulrich Theobald\n\nThe term xingju åå ·, translatable as \"penal instruments\" or \"torture instruments\", were types of equipment used in ancient China to torture and detain criminals or to execute corporal punishment. These instruments were directly related to the judicial system of the time, and thus differed over the ages. Torture was a common method of producing confessions or testimonies during criminal interrogations (xingxun åè¨). Brook, Bourgon and Blue (2008: 9, 43) differentiate between torture, by which suffering is intended to cause suspects to confess, and torment, a type of suffering of the condemned that is intended to make an impression on onlookers.\n\nThe chapter on penal justice (23 Xingfa zhi åæ³å¿) in the official dynastic history Hanshu æ¼¢æ¸ explains that in ancient times, severe punishment (daxing å¤§å) consisted of military service (? jiabing ç²å µ, or penal labour in the production of weaponry) or decapitation (fuyue æ§é, see death penalty), average punishment (zhongxing ä¸­å) by applying knives and saws (dao ju åé¸) for amputation of body parts or needles (zuan zao é½é¿) for tattooing, and minor punishment (boxing èå) of flogging and beating (bian zhang é­æ). Early inscriptions on oracle bones and bronze vessels prove the use of tools to fetter the feet (zhi æ¡), to fetter both hands (gong æ²), and to fetter one hand (gu æ¢). Pottery figurines found in Shang-period å (17th-11th cent. BCE) graves show men and females with fettered hands. The ritual Classic Zhouli å¨ç¦® (part Qiuguan ç§å®, ch. Zhangqiu æå) explains that criminals having committed dangerous offences (shangzui ä¸ç½ª) were detained with two-hand fetters (gong), feet shackles (zhi), and manacles for one hand (gu); perpetrators with average crime records (zhongzui ä¸­ç½ª) by shackles and manacles for hands and feet (zhi gu); and delinquents with light crimes (xiazui ä¸ç½ª) just by manacles for the hands (gu).\n\nFig. 1. Judicial torture\n\nThe delinquent is tied to a construction forcing him to kneel down, while ushers are flogging his arms. The district magistrate, sitting in the background, is waiting for confession. Source: Gray & Gregor 1878.\n\nWith the abolishment of the five penalties of mutilation (rouxing èå, see five punishments wuxing äºå) in the early imperial age, the use of penal tools changed accordingly. The imperial dynasties discerned between legally stipulated tools, and extra-legal tools, of which a wide range was in use. The most important legal ones were the cangue (jia æ·), fetters for hand and feet (chou æ»), neck and leg irons (qian di éé±), chains (suo é), the heavy stick (zhang æ), the light stick (chi ç¬), the whip (bian é­), leg squeezers (jiagun å¤¾æ£) and finger squeezers (zanzhi æ¶æ).\n\nHand and foot shackles\n\n\"Handcuffs\" and shackles (chou æ», also called chouxie æ½æ¢°), belonged to the oldest types of detaining criminals. Gu æ¢ were used to fetter the hands, and zhi æ¡ (also called xie æ¢°) to hold together the feet. In case a criminal was forced to wear both, the term zhi-gu æ¡æ¢ (first attested in the Classic Yijing æç¶ \"Book of Changes\", hexagram meng ä· è) was used. The origin of these instrument is variously credited to the Yellow Emperor é»å¸, his opponent Chi You è©å°¤, or the evil king Zhou ç´ of the Shang dynasty. Details on the dimensions of these types of fetters were fixed in the penal code of the Liang dynasty (æ¢ (502-557), LianglÃ¼ æ¢å¾, as mentioned in the chapter on penal justice (ch. 25) in the official dynastic history Suishu éæ¸. The Liang discerned between xie æ¢°, chou æ», shengxie åæ¢°, and leg irons (di é±). The Northern Dynasties åæ (386~581) used particularly large forms (gaochou é«æ») to detain rebels and insurgents. The chapter on penal law (ch. 50) in the Jiutangshu èåæ¸ likewise says that all tools to detain criminals had different sizes adapted to the seriousness of the crime. According to the administrative regulations Tangliudian åå ­å ¸, a wooden block of hand shackles had a size of 1.6-2 chi (\"feet\", see weights and measures) and a thickness of 1 cun (\"inch\"). The code of the Ming dynasty æ (1368-1644), MinglÃ¼ æå¾, stipulated the use of a wooden board with a length of 1.6 chi and a thickness of 1 cun. It was worn by males sentenced to death, but not by females, and not by persons sentenced to exile (liu æµ) and lesser forms of punishment. During that time, the shackles were for the first time made of iron (called kao ð¨¯).\n\nIron chains\n\nIron chains (suo é, also written é and called tiesuo éµç´¢ or tielian éµé) were first used during the Former Han period åæ¼¢ (206 BCE-8 CE). Nearly all dynasties regulated the dimensions and use of iron chains. The law code of the Chen dynasty é³ (557-589) stipulated that persons sentenced to five years of heavy punishment (including a shaved head and flogging), just one step lower than the death penalty, had to bear a double chain (suo er chong éäºé). Persons sentenced to do penal labour had to wear a neck chain anyway. During the Yuan period å  (1279-1368), the term suo é was used for chains around the neck (jiaxiangsuo å¤¾é é), and liao é to such attached to the legs. The former had a length of between 8 and 12 chi, while the latter had a weight of 3 jin æ¤ (\"pounds\"). The Ming Code (ch. Yuju tu çå ·å) fixed the length of an iron chain at 1 zhang (\"fathom\"). It was used for delinquents sentenced to light penalty (fan qing zui ren ç¯è¼ç½ªäºº), while the foot chain was particularly used for criminals sentenced to do penal servitude (tu å¾).\n\nNeck and leg irons\n\nNeck and leg irons (qian di éé±) were used in early imperial times as a substitute for mutilation. Qian were tied to the neck, and di to the feet. Archaeologists found numerous irons in tombs of the late Warring States æ°å (5th cent.-221 BCE) and the Han period. Neck irons had a weight of 2 jin and had an upright handle (qiao ç¿¹) of 1.5 chi of length, as the code JinlÃ¼ æå¾ and tomb findings prove. Persons forced to do penal servitude were usually restricted by neck irons, and were also shaved their heads (kun é«¡ or é« ). In addition to that, the labour period began with a certain number of lashes with the whip. The warlord Cao Cao æ¹æ (155-220), issuing the Jiazi regulation (Jiazi ke ç²å­ç§), had neck irons made of wood because iron was a scarce material at the time. During the Sui period é (581-618), different sizes of neck irons were known and applied for different grades of crime. The regulations of the Tangliudian from the Tang period å (618-907) stipulated that the neck iron was used for delinquents punished to exile or penal servitude. Legal regulations concerning the dimensions of the neck iron are still found in Song-period å® (960-1279) sources. Leg irons (also called ta é) are first mentioned in the book Guanzi ç®¡å­ (ch. Youguan å¹¼å®). Archaeology has shown that leg irons were tied to chains whose links had a size of 9 Ã 11 cm (Lu 2004: 74). The irons were tied to the left foot and had a weight of 800-1100 g, which contrasts with the statement \"6 jin\" in the book Shiji å²è¨ (30 Pingzhun shu å¹³æºæ¸). Both types of fetters became obsolete from the Yuan period on.\n\nFig. 2-3. Various types of shackles, stocks, and iron chains\n\nThe person on the left image wears neck and foot irons and is forced to wander around like a mendicant. The right image shows delinquents with feet in the stock or with neck chains tied to a stone or metal block. Source: Gray & Gregor 1878.\n\nThe cangue\n\nInstead of neck irons, the wooden cangue became a widespread instrument used to detain and shame criminals in public. It is known as a square wooden board worn around the neck during late imperial times. The word jia æ· is first mentioned in Jin-period æ (265-420) sources, even if similar tools were known as early as the Qin ç§¦ (221-206 BCE) and Han periods. At that time, they were called \"three wooden [tools]\" (sanmu ä¸æ¨) or \"wooden tool\" (xie æ¢°). The word cangue is derived from the French version of the Portuguese word for \"yoke\", canga. The laws of the Northern Wei åé­ (386-534) reserved the cangue for rebels and usurpers. It was a square of 1,3 zhang of width and 1 zhang of length, and in the middle a hole for the neck, with a width of 5 cun. The Northern Qi åé½ (550-577) used the cangue as a replacement for iron chains. The Northern Zhou åå¨ (557-581) ordered that criminals sentenced to death, exile, and penal servitude, had to wear the cangue. During the Tang period, the instrument was known as panjia ç¤æ·. Some notoriously cruel officials made use of ten different sizes of cangues. From the Song period on the courts discerned between three sizes, ranging from 15 to 25 jin of weight. The Ming Code explains that the heavy one was worn by persons to be executed, the 20-jin cangue by persons sentenced to exile and penal servitude, and the light one of 15 jin by persons to be beaten in public. Typical offences punished with the cangue were robbery and theft (qiedao ç«ç), adultery (fanjian ç¯å¥¸), gambling (dubo è³­å), and desertion from the army or the exile. In 1669, the Kangxi Emperor åº·çå¸ (r. 1661-1722) decreed the abolishing of the \"long cangue\" (changjia é·æ·) to detain criminals. It was replaced by iron chains. From then on, the cangue was only used as a tool of varying size (jiahao æ·è) used to punish physically and for public shaming. The weight of the cangue first ranged between 60 and 70 jin, but was in 1740 basically reduced to the standard size of 25-30 jin, even if heaver models remained in practical use. The cangue was also applied to Bannermen which were otherwise spared severe punishment or even exile.\n\nThere was also use of a two-parts or double cangue (lianjia é£æ·) applied to the left and right sides of the neck. An image of a Northern Zhou-period cangue was found on a Dunhuang æ¦ç  manuscript (Shiwu jing tujuanåäºç¶åå·. Another use was to tie together two or even three persons with one single instrument. This custom was applied to enslaved war captives, as during the Sixteen States period åå ­å (300~430), or for criminals, as during the late Qing period æ¸ (1644-1911).\n\nFig. 4. Various torture instruments\n\nImage from the Ming-period encyclopaedia Sancai tuhui ä¸æåæ, Qiyong å¨ç¨ 11, fol. 48, showing wooden hand shackles (shoujiu æç´, right top), iron foot locks (jiaoliao è ³é), finger (zanzi æ¡å­) and leg (jiaogun è ³æ£) squeezers, a \"box bed\" (xiachuang å£åº, bottom right), a light stick made of vitex and a heavy one (chi zhang ç¬æ), a flat board to beat during interrogations (xunzhang è¨æ), a long board to enclose the neck (changzhang é·æ), a cangue (jia æ·, left top), and a cart to transport prisoners (qiuche åè», left bottom).\n\n\"Box beds\"\n\n\"Box beds\" (xiachuang ã­±ç) served to prevent prisoners to escape or kill themselves. The expression is first attested for the Five Dynasties period äºä»£ (907-960). LÃ¼ Kun åå¤ (1536-1618) describes the details of the instrument as used during the late Ming period. The prisoner was tied to the \"bed\" with several iron chains, while the abdomen and the legs were pressed down by wooden balks. The delinquent was definitely brought down by a cover studded with sharp points to restrict the movement of the body. This cruel instrument was abolished by the Qing.\n\nThe heavy stick\n\nThe heavy stick (zhang æ) was either used as an instrument to extort confession or as a tool to execute punishment. It was made of wood, bamboo, or rods of the vitex (jingtiao èæ¢). Under the Qin dynasty, it was called bangchi æ¦ç¬. In 156, the Han dynasty decreed the \"Scourge law\" (Chuiling ç® ä»¤) which fixed exactly the dimensions of the instrument: Length 5 chi, thickness 1 cun at the lower part, and in case of bamboo, flattened nodia. The execution of strokes could be performed by one person. The Tang dynasty fixed the length at 3.5 chi and the thickness between 3.2 and 2.2 fen. Strokes should be distributed over the back, the legs, and the buttocks of the delinquent. The Tang law even limited the strokes to three rounds for interrogations and two hundred strokes in total. The amount was different in case of executing punishment (see heavy stick). The Ming dynasty had the \"interrogation stick\" (xunzhang è¨æ) made of vitex of a length of 3.5 chi and a thickness of between 3.5 and 4.5 fen. The stick was applied to the buttocks.\n\nApart from this legally defined stick, the courts in China used various kinds of cudgels or clubs to extort confession or testimonies. The chapter on penal jurisdiction in the Suishu lists truncheons (dabang å¤§æ£), lashed rods (shuzhang ææ), wheel spokes (chefu è»è¼»), shoe soles (xidi éµåº) and various sticks (zhangguang ææ¡, tinggun æºæ£) used to beat suspects and tormenting them.\n\nWhips and canes\n\nWhips (bian é­) have long history and are attested in the Classic Shangshu å°æ¸ \"Book of Documents\" (ch. Yaodian èå ¸) and the inscription of Western Zhou-period è¥¿å¨ (11th cent.-770 BCE) bronze vessels like Sheng yi ð å and Wei ding è¡é¼ (written ð  ). During that time, scourges were made of vitex, but in imperial times, cowhides were used to produce penal whips. Whips were also used by market supervisors (sishi å¸å¸) and royal guards to drive people out of the way of the king's coach. In early imperial times, sticks (pu æ²) were made of date twigs or cane, even if the sources use the word bian, which actually refers to a leather whip. During the Han period, sticks to beat with were made a legal tool for punishment. The penal code Jinling æä»¤ from the Jin period even determined the exact size of the strap. Heavy crimes were punished with 50 strokes of the leather whip, minor ones with 20, but the penal code Jin zhongxing shu æä¸­èæ¸ (quoted in the encyclopaedia Taiping yulan å¤ªå¹³å¾¡è¦½) speaks of 100 or even 200 lashes. The code of the Liang dynasty discerned between whips of raw and unsmoothened hide (zhibian å¶é­), such of smoothened, but raw hides (fabian æ³é­), and such of cooked, but unsmoothened leather (changbian å¸¸é­). Whips were usually combined with light sticks (xiaozhang å°æ), with the stick being applied first. The penal code of the Northern Wei fixed the length of a whip, and made flogging an additional punishment (fujia xing éå å) for persons sentenced to exile. The Northern Qi abolished the raw-hide whip to avoid excessive loss of blood. There were usually five scales of flogging, with increasing numbers of lashes, but limited to a number of 100. Flogging was abolished by the Sui dynasty in 581, and was afterwards only in use in the Liao empire é¼ (907-1125) under the name bianluo é­ç \"whip-roasting (i.e. torturing)\".\n\nFig. 5. Flogging\n\nThe court ushers drive a thief through the streets while flogging him. One of them beats a gong to announce the event to attract spectators and expose the criminal to public shaming. Source: Gray & Gregor 1878.\n\nLeg squeezers\n\nLeg squeezers (jiagun å¤¾æ£ or æ¢æ£, jiabang å¤¾å¹«, jiabang å¤¾æ£, tuijia è ¿å¤¾, jiaojia è ³å¤¾, cuncunjin å¯¸å¯¸ç·) were prevalent during the Song period, but were used until the end of the imperial era. The Han-period term ya è», the early word yahuai å£è¸, or the Tang-period term daguan å¤§é might refer to a similar tool. Because the tortured persons, lying on the ground face-down, usually lifted their bodies out of pain, the instrument also had the name chaogun è¶ æ£ \"jump stick\".\n\nThe tool was once illegally used by the notorious Brocade Guard (jinyiwei é¦è¡£è¡) of the Ming-period eunuch clique. Huang Yu's é»ç  book Bixuelu ç¢§è¡é describes the torture instrument. It consisted of two 3-chi-long sticks of poplar wood tied to the right leg of the delinquent who was lying on the ground. The squeezed leg was held upright, while court ushers wildly stroke against the wood. During the Qing period, the instrument was legalized, but was only applied to male dangerous criminals. The instrument consisted of three 3-chi-long sticks of wood (hence the name sanchi ä¸å°º or sanchimu ä¸å°ºæ¨) that were round at the top and square at the bottom. Both legs were thus squeezed between the sticks, while pressure could be regulated by ropes. One stick was stuck between the two legs, and one on each outer side of the legs. Deviating sizes or special modes of application were illegal. The sticks were used for \"squeezer\" interrogations (jiaxun å¤¾è¨). A judge using the leg squeezer for women risked dismissal. The instrument was not allowed to be applied more than twice to the same person.\n\nFig. 6. Leg squeezers\n\n\"The Rack\". Source: Mason 1801.\n\nFinger squeezers\n\nFinger squeezers (zanzhi æ¶æ, zanzi æ¶å­, also written æ¡, also named shu tan zheng é¼ å½ç® \"the rat plays the zither\") came into widespread use during the Qing period, even if they are attested for the Northern Qi dynasty with the name jiazhi å¤¾æ. LÃ¼ Kun's Shizhenglu å¯¦æ¿é, a book on district administration, says that the finger squeezers were actually not legal, but found entrance to the courts during the Ming period, and soon became popular. They consisted of five round wooden sticks of 7 cun of length and 0.45-0.5 cun diameter. The fingers of the delinquent were stuck in-between. The sticks were tied by a rope at which ends two court ushers used to pull in order to squeeze the fingers of the culprit and extort confession or answer. There were light and heavy forms, old and new tools (the latter being sharper), and a custom of applying them wet or dry. The instrument was mainly used for females, as the \"leg twisters for women\", as the commented administrative glossary Liubu chengyu zhujie å ­é¨æèªæ³¨è§£ said. It was not allowed to apply the finger squeezers more than twice for one person in order not to cripple the suspect. It should also be used to solve severe crimes only.\n\nFig. 7. Finger squeezers\n\n\"Torturing the Fingers\". Source: Mason 1801.\n\nMing-period inquisitors knew quite a further range of illegal torture instruments, like the \"brain press\" (naogu è ¦ç®, also called tiejuan éµå or miegu ç¯¾ç®), the \"roasting iron\" (laotie çéµ), \"one letter\" (yi feng shu ä¸å°æ¸, shape and use unknown), the \"horse-taming club\" (lanmagun æé¦¬æ£ or éé¦¬æ£), \"swallows fly\" (yan'er fei çå é£, appearance and use unknown), sharply pointed bamboo sticks (zhuqian ç«¹ç°½) or \"bone-grinding nails\" (moguding ç£¨éª¨é). The \"brain press\" consisted of a string, a cow-leather ring, and a bamboo construction. During interrogation, the ushers pulled the string or used other methods to exert pressure around the delinquent's head. During the Ming and Qing periods, the instrument was forbidden, but was nevertheless used here and there. It is first described in the chapter on penal law in the history book Songshi å®å², and is also mentioned in Xu Yuanrui's å¾å ç administrative handbook Lixue zhinan åå­¸æå and Zheng Tingyu's é­å»·ç theatre play Houtinghua å¾åº­è±, both from the Yuan period.\n\nIn 1912, the Provisional Government of the Republic of China (1912-1949) legally abolished the use of torture as a means of judicial interrogation.\n\nSources:\n\nBrook, Timothy, JÃ©rÃ´me Bourgon & Gregory Blue (2008).
