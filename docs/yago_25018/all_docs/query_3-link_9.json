        "text": "Although it’s been awhile since I posted one this isn’t one of my favorite couple posts. This time I want to discuss GusH in terms of current story from the episode guide. If you have been watching the Manny clips, you’ll have met Gus Aitoro, FBI Prosecutor (which honestly I don’t think that is even really a thing) when he came into Inferno basically to make Danny upset and to be introduced to him by Mary/May. Very shortly afterward he showed up at the Bauer House to accuse Danny of a lot of things when Frank Cooper, Harley Cooper, and David Grant, all of SFPD were there to tell them about how they found Tony shot in the Lewis House. He demonstrated very thoroughly why a lot of local cops don’t like the FBI on their turf. Gus is arrogant, rude, 100% sure he is right at all times, with a smart mouth on him. He is also obsessed with getting Danny Santos anyway possible as revenge for what Danny’s father ordered for his father, despite the fact that his sister has already killed Danny’s uncle who actually pulled the trigger (a life for a life or even I’d say). In addition, part of Gus’s duty as a lawyer is to uphold the Constitution which very clearly states that there is to be “no corruption of the blood” which means you can’t be held accountable for a relative’s crimes which is exactly what he’s trying to do with Danny. I’ll continue to drop GusH scenes in as I find them and they fit, but it’s important to understand that this was a storyline the show was very invested in and some of the incomprehendable things Gus does (like show up uninvited at the Bauer BBQ and the Bauer cabin – when he is obviously persona non grata with them) is because he’s trying to get close to Harley and actively campaigning to break Harley and Rick up. Things don’t make sense unless you know that.\n\nGus and Harley have a Moonlighting feel relationship where they act angry at each other at first, learn they work together well, and eventually find romance. While Harley disliked working with Gus at first, especially when he pressures her into helping bug the Bauer House, eventually they come to a place of mutual respect. Despite the fact that she was trying to make a go of it with Rick at the time since they’d been good friends for years and were now having a baby, Harley eventually succumbs and decides she wants Gus instead if he can get over his vendetta against Danny. (At the same time Rick was entering an entirely chemistry-less marriage to doctor/lawyer Mel.) It’s even Gus who gets to be there for Jude’s birth, not Rick his father.\n\nGus is eventually domesticated, even working with Danny to bring in Carmen when Danny is driven to the point that he feels he has no choice. The domesticated Gus is a good guy who tries to do the right thing while honoring his family ties (which when those ties end up to be to Eden and the Spauldings complicates matters). I will also give Gus props for saving Danny’s life in the warehouse fire, even though he says he only did it so he could continue prosecuting him, and for definitely being a good husband and an outstanding father to Harley’s step-kids and in this later version genuinely always trying to do the right thing although he struggled sometimes to know what the “right thing” was.\n\nGusH ended up to one of the most popular couples on the show and I must admit that they were one of the most stable couples until the writing for the pair turned crazy as they neared Gus’s death including a fake wedding to Olivia while he was then married to Natalia and GusH not only not sending each other longing looks, but never being in the same room. Harley is one of the characters I’m most willing to see with other people. I still think Alan-Michael was who she really belonged with, but I liked her with Mallet #1 and would have given Mallet #2 more of a chance. I’ll even admit that a lot of Pharley scenes early on were pretty great (although later the pairing ultimately damaged her character). Still GusH is not one of my favorite couples because they don’t meet one of my main criteria, they aren’t better together than apart, except when they are working a case. Once they settle down together, Harley regains a lot of the personality she had lost while married to Phillip, but is incredibly spiteful treating Phillip like he’s the devil incarnate well before he gets driven crazy and cuts him no slack for the mental illness that she contributed to and which helped cause his actions. Meanwhile Gus is completely ruled by Harley, kind of like Mattessa, Gus is treated as if he was a junior partner in the relationship. He hates Phillip because Harley says to. He even divorces Harley because Harley says so. Watch how it all plays out and judge for yourself.\n\nP.S. Part of my problem with this couple was that GusH story and the Harlett story were practically identical, except for the vengence thing and I really think they played it out better then.\n\nRobansuefarm is the handle of one of Manny and Guiding Light‘s biggest fans following in her family’s footsteps of Guiding Light fandom since 1939.
