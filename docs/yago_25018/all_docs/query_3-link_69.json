He has been portrayed by Frank Dicopoulos since October 31, 1987.\n\nCharacter information\n\nBackground\n\nA young Frank was left alone to raise his sister, Harley. He got involved in crime to support them, but was soon set straight by Ross Marler. He turned to detective work and was lucky enough to have inherited his grandfather's diner to keep himself afloat. His compassionate nature has often put him at a disadvantage in dealing with women. He entered into a series of failed relationships with the community pariahs (Mindy Lewis, Dana Jones) before being played by Alan-Michael Spaulding during his seduction of Frank's arranged bride, Eleni Andros. He bought her a house, but destroyed it when he discovered that she had married Alan-Michael to get into the country. Eventually, she ran to Frank after she discovered her husband's twisted manipulations. The couple had a daughter, Marina, and worked through a difficult marriage as they fought over careers and lack of money. Finally, after rescuing her following her abduction in Greece, he decided to become a police officer."
