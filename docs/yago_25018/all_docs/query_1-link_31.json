        "meta_description": "Tues Jan 30 2007: With Robert Newman, Michelle Ray Smith, John Driscoll, Nicole Forester. Josh and Cassie try to have a romantic evening together, starting with a dinner at Towers. Their romantic plans prove disastrous for the rest of the evening. Reva visits Cal at Cedars and Lillian tells her that Cal's condition is very grave. Cal is surprised to see Reva, but wants her to leave and not tie herself down by trying to comfort him. Reva tells him about her rather pleasant dinner she shared with Alan Spaulding the day before. After Jonathan and Lizzie's breakup, Beth arrives, at Jonathan's request, to look after her daughter. When Beth goes to draw a bath for Lizzie, Lizzie takes Sarah and leaves Cross Creek in an attempt to get Jonathan to come back to her. Jonathan arrives at Tammy's suite at the Beacon and tells her that he made it official, he left Lizzie and his fake marriage, as far as he's concerned, is over! Lizzie goes to speak with Father Ray at the church, reeling him in with her story of depression and poor relationship with her husband. Meanwhile, a young man breaks into Lizzie's car and drives away...with Sarah still in the backseat! When Lizzie gets the news that her car has been stolen, she realizes that her plan has backfired and admits that she was lying and that her baby was in the car. She calls Jonathan and tells him what happened, he is not pleased and takes his angry and frustration out on Lizzie at the church. Frank tells them the police have located the car and they all rush to Main Street. Jonathan finds Sarah safe but refuses to let Lizzie hold the child. He tells her that after her latest stunt, he's filing for custody of Sarah the next day. Lizzie turns to her mother for support, but Beth is at a loss for words and sides with Jonathan. Beth tells Lizzie that you never leave a newborn child alone, especially in a car during winter. Lizzie collapses in tears. Upset over Cal's condition, Reva decides she needs a night out on the town and phones Billy to go dancing with her. While getting ready, Reva feels a knot in her breast and fears that, like Cal, her cancer may have also returned.",
