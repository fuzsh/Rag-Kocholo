        "text": "FBI agent Gus Aitoro started investigating the Santos mob family in Chicago with the help of May Merisi (aka Mary Murto). Gus arrived in Springfield in the Spring of 2001 when May called him telling him that ex-mobster Danny Santos was ready to make a deal. However, when Danny Santos refused Gus's offer to bring down the other mob families, Gus made the Santos family the main target of his investigation. To help his investigation, Gus enlisted the help of the Springfield Police Department, working very closely with Detective Harley Cooper. Though recognizing that Gus had a job to do, Harley was very unnerved with Gus's determination in bringing down the Santos family. However, Harley had no choice but to cooperate in the investigation, despite the fact that Gus was having her do questionable things, such as planting a bug in the Bauer home (where Danny and Michelle Santos were living). While listening in, Gus and Harley get a clue that Danny might have been involved in his mother's death. On a hunch, Gus had Carmen Santos's ashes examined and learned that they are the remains of a dog! Armed with this information, Gus accused Danny of faking Carmen's death. However, Gus's interrogation lead Danny to realize that his home was bugged. While Gus was trying to build a case against Danny, it was obvious that the investigation into her friends' lives was making Harley physically ill. However, soon Gus learned that it wasn't the investigation at all--Harley was pregnant. Though touched by Harley's unplanned pregnancy with Rick Bauer, Gus still had a job to do and concentrated his efforts at nailing Danny by offering his mother-in-law, Claire Ramsey, a deal.\n\nWhen Claire was unable to get any useful information on Danny, Gus finally decided to take matters into his own hands and planted the evidence himself. After a unidentified body was found in the lake, Gus, who believed the body was Carmen's, broke in to the Bauer house, he found Danny's gun, fired a shot, and took the slug, later telling Harley that the bullet was found in Carmen's body. Unfortunately for Gus, two things would happen at Danny's murder trial. Michelle and Danny claimed to have proof that Gus tampered with evidence. As the defense was able to show that the evidence against Danny had been fabricated, they became suspicious of Gus's true identity. Although it was speculated that Gus was Miguel Santos, Jr. , Blake Marler came in with the truth--Gus was in reality Nick Augustino, whose father, Joe Augustino, had been a cop killed by Miguel Santos! When the true motive behind Gus's vendetta came out, his career was ruined. Seemingly chagrined at his ruin, Gus complimented Harley on how well she did her job and opened up to her about his father's death. Meanwhile, although he appeared to be down for the count, Gus wasn't giving up and while he appeared to be starting a new career as a private investigator, he was still working for the FBI to get information on Springfield's crime families. Meanwhile, Harley was at the near the end of her pregnancy, and was stopped for speeding in a little town called Brewster's Point. Though she tried to explain to the officer that she was a cop, he didn't believe her and had her thrown into the town's one-person jail. Though she tried to call Rick but somehow there was a mix-up and Gus wound up taking the call. Thoroughly enjoying Harley's predicament, Gus went to Brewster's Point. However, Gus's amusement ended when suddenly Harley started having contractions in the empty police station and Harley informed him that he'd have to deliver her baby! Freaking out, Gus tried to get Harley out of the cell and ended up getting himself locked in the cell with her! Luckily, Rick, who figured out the phone mishap, found them and although he couldn't get in the cell, he talked Gus through the delivery. Despite it being a breech birth, Gus successfully delivered Harley and Rick's baby boy who, with a little help from Gus, Harley named Jude Cooper Bauer.\n\nBy this time Gus and Harley's attraction to each other had grown, and Gus found it difficult to get Harley out of his mind. Knowing that Harley was considering going into a loveless marriage with Rick, Gus tried to dissuade her and later set her up to see Rick in an embrace with the woman he loved, Mel Boudreau. Later, upon learning that Carmen made a deal with his boss to keep Danny out of prison, Gus resigned from the FBI. Although Harley, angry at his attempts to arrest Danny, stated that there was no reason for him to stay in town, Gus was finding himself very attracted to Harley. Touched that she'd care so much about him to be angry, he decided to stay. Despite everything she told everyone, including herself, Harley couldn't deny her feelings for Gus. However, Harley was determined to marry Rick so that they could be a family. Hoping to get Harley to change her mind, Gus asked her to work for him to nail Danny, which would give him the added benefit of getting Danny in jail. Unfortunately, despite his pleas, Harley refused. Not long after, Gus became a hero when he saved Danny from a fire at a warehouse. Despite claims that he only did it so that he could see Danny thrown in jail later, Harley was impressed. Meanwhile, Gus decided to make a change and joined the Springfield Police force--where Harley ended up being his supervisor. Harley still kept her distance from Gus though, knowing that her entire family and the fathers of her two youngest children despised him. However, in 2002, while investigating the Tory Granger case, she gave into her passion. This culminated in a hotel room nearly burning down and Harley and Gus being arrested as they made out in a car.\n\nAfterwards, Gus dropped his vendetta against Danny Santos in order to be a better man for Harley, Touched by his efforts to change, Harley opened herself up to Gus. The first major obstacle for Gus and Harley came when her niece, Marina, who thought Gus was abusing Harley, planted herself in his bed and pretended that he had seduced her. Fortunately, Harley believed in Gus throughout and he moved into her house. Although Marina eventually confessed her lies, the damage had been done, as Harley's brother, Frank, had uncovered Gus's juvenile record. Phillip, Harley's ex-husband, also got a copy and handed the evidence over to Harley, letting her decide for herself. Confronted by Harley, Gus told her the truth: he had been jailed for pushing a man off the roof, but he was actually taking the blame for a girl, Eden. Harley believed him, but when Phillip learned Gus was still living with her and helping raise her children, he was livid. When Phillip took Zach and planned to file for sole custody, Harley broke into his family's mansion, only to be caught as she attempted to flee with her son. She was jailed and suspended from the force pending a hearing. When Gus refused to tell Phillip or the police of his covering up for Eden, she threw him out of her house. Later, Harley decided to go look for Eden herself, believing this was her only real chance to clear her name as well as Gus's. After a short search, Harley found Eden, who turned out to be Gus's kid sister! Apparently, years earlier, Gus's father made Gus promise to take the blame for the crime that Eden committed. Now a grown woman, a selfish Eden initially agreed to help Gus and Harley by confessing but later reneged on the deal. Luckily, Alexandra Spaulding, Phillip's aunt, offered to help Harley keep custody of her son while Harley temporarily left Gus because of Eden. After Zach was nearly killed by a hit and run driver, Phillip dropped the custody battle in spite of his hatred for Gus.\n\nAbout this time, Gus found out that his late father, Joe Augustino, whom he had idolized all his life, might have been a dirty cop. When Alex seemed to defend Joe, Gus and Harley began to suspect that Alex might have known Joe and they began making attempts to unearth Alex's secrets. Harley and Gus learned that his father had walked a beat near the Spaulding mansion. A young woman had been found dead soon after Gus's birth, in a warehouse owned by none other than Miguel Santos, the man he had despised for decades! After threatening and even arresting Alex, Gus and Harley figured out that the young woman had been a recent arrival from Italy who worked as a nanny for a very young Phillip and was fired for being involved with Miguel Santos. During the course of the investigation, it became likely that Miguel Santos was Gus's father, an idea that unsettled Gus. On a tip from Eden, Gus looked up Lucia Renaldi, an old friend of the family who stopped coming around when he was still a kid. Told that she was dead, Gus didn't believe it and ending up meeting her. Unfortunately Lucia was no help, simply saying that she knew his birth mother who gave him up to give him a better life. Steeling himself for the possibility that he was a Santos, Gus submitted to a DNA test that came back negative. Confused, he and Harley went over the evidence and realized that all roads led back to Alexandra, who'd been lying to them for weeks. Believing that Alex must be his mother, Gus and Harley confronted Alex only to come face to face with Lucia, aka Regina Tessori. It was then they learned the real truth, Gus was a Spaulding--Alan's son! Apparently, Alan had had an affair with Phillip's nanny, Regina, years earlier and Alex, trying to protect everyone involved gave the child to the Augustinos.\n\nNot long after, Gus surprisingly proposed to Harley, and she accepted. Meanwhile, Alan was becoming unstable and very delusional at finally at his competency hearing wandered away from the courthouse and was ready to jump off a bridge. Luckily, Gus saved him and brought him to his and Harley's house. While with Gus, Alan's head started to clear which led him to a startling conclusion--Alexandra must have been drugging him so she could keep control of Spaulding! But that wasn't the only surprise Alan would receive. Suspicious about his reasons for helping, Alan demanded to know what was in it for Gus. That's when Gus admitted that Alan was his father. Incredulous, Alan refused to believe Gus, who then brought Phillip's former nanny, Lucia (formerly Regina Tessori) to confirm the story. Now free of the drug, Alan recognized Lucia. Though Alan immediately denied ever sleeping with Regina, he later admitted that what she said was true.\n\nIn 2004, Gus found himself involved in intrigue at Spaulding Enterprises when y Jeffrey approached him with a stunning theory--Spaulding was involved with the mob! Incredulous, Gus agreed to covertly investigate the company in order to clear Alan's name. Learning from Jeffrey that a black market drug called Delirium was hitting the streets, and Delirium was derived from Spaulding's drug Antimonious, Gus did some digging and learned that shipments of Antimonious were in fact disappearing. However, when he brought up this fact at a Spaulding board meeting, his concerns were brushed away, especially by Brad Green, the head of Spaulding's Pharmaceutical division. In the midst of all of this, Gus kept seeing an unlikely person in the presence of Brad Green--Harley! Although Harley was able to explain away her friendship with Brad, stating that she was trying to smooth things over with him and Gus, it was clear that she had been keeping something from him. Finally, the cause of Harley's secretive behavior became known when Jeffrey revealed that Harley was also investigating Spaulding! Initially angry that Harley kept her involvement from him, he soon realized that they made a good team and they pooled their resources. Meanwhile, after months on the fruitless investigation, Gus heard a startling confession from Alan. Apparently several years earlier, Alan, on a lark, drugged himself, four other men (including Harley's father, Buzz) and a young woman with Antimonious. Tragically, that night, the car they were in went off the road; the young woman died and the men covered up the entire incident. Armed with this knowledge, Gus was at a loss about what to do--should he turn his father in, or let him go scot-free for covering up the girl's death? Luckily for Gus, Harley came up with a third alternative -- Gus could persuade Alan to accept a deal with the cops. In exchange for immunity in the woman's death, Alan would give Spaulding Pharmaceutical files to the D.A. to help in their investigation.\n\nUnfortunately for Gus, Jeffrey changed the deal in midstride and informed Alan that they'd be investigating the entire company! Although Alan agreed to the deal, when he learned that Gus had infiltrated Spaulding because he thought they may be involved with the mob, he became furious and wrote Gus out of his life. Learning that mobster Vinnie Salerno was the mob connection to Antimonious, Gus took his investigation into the street. Although an undercover Gus was able to locate a dealer for Delirium and thereby secure a shipment, the investigation was hampered by Eden herself! Being forced into working for Salerno one last time, she got the drugs to him but then angrily flushed them down the toilet. Now an enemy of Salerno, the DA's office was forced to fake Eden's death and she entered the witness protection program, leaving Springfield and Gus behind forever. Weeks later, Gus and the feds got another chance to nab Salerno and his supplier at Spaulding. Hiding in the basement of the Beacon during the drop, Gus saw Brad leave the drugs in a duffle bag that was picked up by Danny (also working undercover) and exchanged for a briefcase full of money. Knowing whoever picked up the money would be the Spaulding supplier, Gus was shocked when it turned out to be Alexandra! Caught red-handed, Alex tried to deny any involvement but was rattled when Alan emerged from the shadows and announced that he'd been trailing her and he had proof that she was involved in the drug ring. Rattled, Alex was forced to confess that she hired Brad in Europe years earlier because he promised to make Spaulding Pharmaceuticals a huge success. Wanting to make good with her family, Alex gave him full reign but had no idea that he was dealing with the mob. By the time she found out, it was too late, and already in too deep, she kept quiet for fear of being implicated.\n\nAlthough Gus was ready to arrest her for criminal conspiracy, Alan pled on Alex's behalf and Gus reluctantly agreed to keep quiet about her involvement. Touched, and knowing that this went against every fiber in Gus's being, a grateful Alex offered to throw Gus and Harley's wedding. Although Gus felt tremendous guilt about lying to Harley, both Alan and Alex convinced him that nothing was wrong with keeping silent. Unfortunately things would start to fall apart. Convinced that Brad had an accomplice, Frank started investigating the Antimonious case further. Afraid that Frank would stumble onto her secret, Alex decided to deter the investigation by framing Frank for the crime! Desperate for a scapegoat, Alex secretly left a tip with Ross (now the mayor) and Frank was suspended from the police force. However, when Gus learned that Frank was under investigation, he quickly put two and two together and realized what Alex was doing. Although Alex tried to convince Gus to keep her secret, he made it clear that he wouldn't let Frank be punished for a crime he didn't commit. Although Gus saw an opportunity to both Frank and Alex by getting Vinnie to sign a false confession (with the idea that he might get a better sentence), Vinnie saw through the ruse and refused to sign the document. Finally, things came to a head the evening before their wedding, when Harley finally figured out that Alex was Brad's accomplice. As she railed at Alexandra for her lies and deception, to the shock of both women, Gus stepped in and demanded that Harley back off his family. Wanting to give Gus the wedding he deserved, Harley agreed to lay off until after the wedding. However, the day of the wedding, the guilt became too much for him and he decided that before he married Harley she had to know the whole truth. Unfortunately, he was too late--Harley already knew via a security tape showing him and Alexandra discussing her collusion with Brad Green! Disgusted that Gus protected his family at the expense of hers, Harley called off the wedding. Weeks later, she admitted that she still loved him and stated that if he disowned his family, they could have a future. However, Gus was unwilling to forsake the only family he had left and refused. With his refusal, Harley returned his ring and the pair went their separate ways.\n\nHaving finally made the choice to stick with his family, Gus then quit the force and went to work at Spaulding. Although Beth tried to urge him to fight for Harley, Gus decided that he was through with her and left town to clear his head. When he returned a few weeks later, he was shocked to learn that Phillip had initiated a twisted vendetta against the Coopers and arranged for the demolition of Company, Buzz's restaurant. Protective of Harley and the Coopers, Gus tried to get Alan to force Phillip to back off, but Alan refused to side with one son against the other. Instead he urged Gus to fight Phillip on his own terms inside Spaulding. Gus took Alan's words to heart, and tried to use his position as Spaulding legal counsel to help the Coopers. In the course of the next few weeks, someone was leaking Spaulding information to the press. As the weeks went by, Phillip was becoming more and more callous. Soon he became paranoid that someone was conspiring against him and demanded that Gus find out who the mole was. Although Gus was reluctant at first to do Phillip's dirty work, he later agreed when Alan pointed out that Gus would be more rational than Phillip.\n\nThe first on Gus's list was Phillip's new assistant, Ruth Karloff, especially after all of her references seemed fake. While Gus was becoming concerned that the mole was actually Ruth, Phillip expressed his doubts. Unfortunately, when \"Ruth\" started asking questions to both Lizzie and Phillip, he quickly realized that Gus was right and decided that Ruth needed to be neutralized to protect Lizzie who unbeknownst to everyone else was involved in a hit and run. Phillip arranged for a man to run \"Ruth\" down! Luckily for Harley, Gus saved her life and in the process, discovered that Harley was Ruth! To her surprise, Gus agreed to keep her secret. Later, Harley, as Ruth, confronted Phillip about her nearly fatal accident. Days later, Harley received a notice to meet Phillip at the mansion only to find herself alone with Olivia and Beth. Finally, Phillip showed up and apologized to the women for all the pain he'd caused and stated that he was calling a truce. He then left, leaving the woman skeptical as to Phillip's sincerity. That same day, the women were shocked when they discovered that Phillip had made off with all of his children! Later, Phillip asked several people to meet him at Company at 9pm, telling each person that if they came, and told no one else of the meeting, their children would be returned to them. At 9pm, the various citizens of Springfield converged at Company to find Phillip shot! Although he was rushed to the hospital, it was too late and Phillip was declared dead. But Gus was concerned because one person was not there at the scene--Harley! That same night, Harley, dressed as Ruth, came to Company. However, she was dazed, disheveled, and apparently had been in a scuffle.\n\nHaving no memory of that night, all she could remember was a scuffle with Phillip and a gun. After convincing Harley to keep quiet, Gus was able to locate the missing children. For days, Harley was consumed with the thought that she killed Phillip, especially when she, without trying, found the gun at Company. Distraught, Harley was sure she'd killed her son's father until Gus walked her through that night by asking about Company's security system. Suspecting that Buzz killed Phillip, Harley decided to protect her father. Despite Gus's misgivings, Harley came up with a plan to protect Buzz---frame \"Ruth\" for Phillip's murder. Harley them came up with the plan to, disguised as Ruth, tape a confession and then stage a suicide. Afraid of what could go wrong, Gus refused to help her. Unfortunately, Gus was correct and things went horribly wrong. After learning from Frank that Ruth was spotted on the bridge. Gus rushed to the scene. At the same time, Frank arrived, yelled for \"Ruth\" to surrender. Panicked, Harley tried to run. Despite Gus's pleas for Frank not to fire, Frank pulled out his gun and fired a warning shot. Suddenly, Harley lost her footing and went over the bridge. As the police searched for Ruth on the rocks below the bridge, Gus found Harley hidden on a beam under the bridge. Harley pleaded with Gus to help cover for her and say he saw the body washed away by the current. Days later, on Christmas, Gus and Harley unexpectedly shared a kiss while putting Zach's star atop the tree at Christmas. Unfortunately, the moment was broken, when Frank came in to arrest Harley--he recognized her on \"Ruth's videotape. As Gus passionately defended her, Harley agreed to go down to the station with Frank. After kissing her again, Gus swore he'd find the real killer.\n\nThroughout the early part of 2005, Gus worked relentlessly at proving Harley's innocence. Although Jeffrey tried to offer Harley a deal--a lesser sentence if she pled guilty, Gus continually refused to let her accept it. Gus tried, and failed, to find other viable suspects. At the same time Gus was trying to prove she was innocent, Harley kept having doubts and wondered if she actually did kill Phillip. Gus continually refused to acknowledge the mere possibility, even going as far as to interrupt a hypnosis session when Harley was about to have a memory breakthrough. Even though Harley was all set to say goodbye to her life, Gus refused to let her give up on her future. Unfortunately, Harley was found guilty. Although he talked about making plans to appeal, Gus had worked himself so feverishly over the course of the previous months that he suddenly collapsed from a bleeding ulcer! Although he was encouraged to stay in the hospital, he refused and kept on with his intention to free Harley, even though she tried to order him to get some rest. Determined to be near the woman he loved, Gus bought an apartment right next to the prison, a prospect that horrified Harley since she wanted him to get on with his life. Despite favorable testimony from Alan (under duress from Gus), Harley was sentenced to 25 years. Later, Gus pulled some strings and came to visit Harley and while sharing a painful good-bye, she realized the attention she was attracting. Not wanting anyone else to think she got special treatment, Gus and Harley staged a fight and he left her. However, Gus got a ray of hope when someone sent him an anonymous note stating that Phillip's killer is still at large! Seeing a chance to save Harley, Gus went back to Alan and apologized and asked to move back into the mansion.\n\nSensing that Olivia could be the guilty party, Gus tried to discreetly investigate by pretending to be her friend. Meanwhile, angry that the new prison warden wasn't allowing him to visit Harley, Gus angrily confronted the man only to be shocked to later learn he was Harley's ex-husband, A.C. Mallet. Although Mallet stated that he wanted to help Harley from the inside, Gus suspected his true motives. That same night, Gus was suddenly grabbed from behind and imprisoned! Gus's situation worsened when he refused to accept water from his captor. Though Gus was able to pry open a panel and grab hold of his captor's ankle, the person was able to escape. About a week later, desperate to escape, Gus set a fire, hoping to attract someone's attention. As it began to get out of hand, Alan arrived and saved him. Gus immediately accused Alan of being the kidnapper and locked him in the room while he rushed off to get to Harley. Fearing for Harley's safety, Gus conspired with Buzz to find a way into the prison. He donned the disguise of a prison guard but once inside, Harley's cellmate Lena (who was also a spy for Alan) spotted him and nearly exposed him. But, Lena ended up covering for him and sent him off to rescue Harley. After seeing her bonding with Mallet, Harley confided to Gus that she'd had her first memory flash--she remembered smelling jasmine when Phillip was killed. Just then, Mallet broke up the reunion with horrifying news--Harley was set to be transferred to a prison nicknamed Hell Hole. Meanwhile, Gus returned to free Alan from the locked room, only to find him missing. Hearing footsteps, Gus hid in the room to set a trap for his captor. He then caught Olivia and realized she's the one who locked him away. Now definitely believing that Olivia was the killer, Gus kidnapped Emma as a way to smoke Olivia out. Olivia nearly cracked, apparently on the verge of confessing to something when Bill Lewis stepped in and interrupted.\n\nMeanwhile, Harley and her cellmate were on a bus headed for Hell House. Just when things looked hopeless, the bus suddenly flipped over and caught on fire leaving her and Lena trapped. Just when it seemed as if they were doomed, Gus (who had spotted the transfer bus on the road) appeared and pulled Harley to safety. The pair then struggled to free Lena but it was too late and the woman died in Harley's arms. Harley and Gus now had the perfect opportunity to escape, yet Mallet found them and stood in their way. Mallet and Gus each made a case for why he was the one to best protect Harley in the wake of her prison escape. But Harley's heart belonged to Gus and Mallet was forced to let her go, sacrificing himself to the authorities to give them time to escape. After buying a vendor's ice cream truck for transportation, Gus and Harley resolved to find the person who had been sending Gus notes about Phillip's murder. Knowing the notes were coming from New York, Gus and Harley fled there.\n\nRealizing that the mystery man who may know who killed Phillip was staying somewhere near the Brooklyn Bridge, they finally located his hotel. Unfortunately, the mystery man was out. To their luck, the saw the man go in and then quickly donned disguises to slip in and find out what room he was in. Unfortunately, Alan (who both were aware put a bounty on Harley's head) sent his henchman, Sebastian, to New York to permanently silence the man, Dr. Wallace. Unfortunately, just as Gus and Harley arrived at Wallace's room, Sebastian pulled the fire alarm as a diversion to get to Wallace and Harley and Gus barely got away without being seen. Luckily that same night, Harley and Gus saw Wallace once again outside the Brooklyn hotel and rushed out to confront him. Unfortunately, just as Wallace was about to reveal the identity of Phillip's real killer, a cab, driven by Sebastian, came out of nowhere and ran Wallace down. Wallace was rushed to the hospital but remained comatose. Realizing that they may have lost their only chance to learn the truth, Gus tried to persuade Harley to just take the boys and go on the lam with him. But Harley wasn't ready to give up hope yet and she and cautiously returned to the hospital to find Dr. Wallace awake. When they finally got a moment alone with him, Gus made an emotional appeal for Wallace to help Harley clear her name. Unfortunately, before Wallace could reveal what he knows, the police showed up. Luckily, the police didn't recognize the couple--they only wanted their statements about the hit and run. Unfortunately, by the time the pair went back into Wallace's room, the man was dead. Later, after making love on the closed set, Harley receives a call Mallet warning her that Alan knew where she was.\n\nMallet's warnings seemingly came too late. Harley and Gus heard noises and realized that the police were closing in on them. With Mallet's help, Gus faked his death. Unfortunately, Sebastian discovered where Gus was and called the Springfield police. As Gus was being carted away by Frank, Mallet got a lucky break when he found a note in Wallace's possessions that named Phillip's killer--Alan! Days later, obvious as to what Mallet and Harley found, Gus ran into an increasingly paranoid Alan at Company. Harley set a trap for Alan by anonymously asking him to meet her at Company. Knowing he'd been found out, Alan brought a gun to the meeting and waited. The first person he saw was Gus and, assuming that Gus knew the truth, Alan had a gun and appeared on the brink of silencing Gus the same way he silenced Phillip. But, Harley arrived and explained that she was the one who uncovered the truth. Alan stonewalled but Harley tricked him into confessing. Outraged and completely over the edge, Alan raised his gun, determined to keep the truth of what happened to Phillip a secret. Luckily, at this moment, Mallet arrived with gun in hand and stopped Alan. Trapped, Alan tried to recant his confession, but was shocked when Lizzie, Alex, Beth, Rick, Bill and Olivia, who were all summoned by Harley, appeared and revealed that they heard Alan's admission. Though Alan tried to weasel out of it, Alex stepped forward and revealed that she had physical evidence that Alan shot Phillip. With Alexandra's testimony, Harley was cleared of all charges and Alan was sent to jail. Their ordeal finally over, Gus proposed marriage again and Harley accepted. Later, Alan shocked Gus and Harley by blurting out that Phillip was alive. Alan faked his death! Although Gus didn't believe Alan's claim that a mentally disturbed Phillip was living out his life in an abandoned warehouse, Harley wasn't so sure. Against Gus's wishes, Harley spoke with Alan and agreed to get him released from jail if he showed her where Phillip was. Unfortunately for Alan, when he took Harley, Mallet (who had returned to the Springfield PD) and Frank to the warehouse, Phillip was nowhere to be found. BWhen Harley continued to be worried that Phillip was alive, Gus tricked Alan into signing an exhumation order for Phillip's grave. The day of the wedding, Rick performed the exhumation and informed Harley that Phillip was indeed dead.\n\nLater, Gus and Harley returned from their honeymoon and stumbled upon an unconscious Coop, moments before a dangerous gas leak could do any serious damage. Coop turned out to be alright, although Lizzie informed the pair that she thought Alan had orchestrated the accident. Although the pair investigated, they came up with nothing to prove that Alan was involved. Meanwhile, Gus was preparing to take over at Spaulding Enterprises. However, on the day of the stockholder's meeting to vote him in as CEO, Gus suddenly froze and ran out. Harley quickly finished his speech and got a most unexpected result: the board was so impressed; they elected her to be the new CEO. When Gus encouraged Harley to take the Spaulding CEO job, she pushed him to go after his badge, knowing it is what he really wanted. Harley then met with Alan who told her that she would ultimately fail in trying to run Spaulding. Weeks later, Blake created a scandal by publishing a thinly disguised book about Harley and Mallet's relationship. Although Gus tried to act like he didn't care, it was obvious that he was concerned about any lingering feelings Harley might have for Mallet. Later, after reading the book, Gus asked Harley if she slept with Mallet in the prison. Harley said no, but admitted that she and Mallet made peace with each other while they were in prison, leaving Gus unsettled. After stopping Beth from a powerplay at Spaulding, Gus was unnerved to hear that Alan was going to be released from the mental hospital. At year's end, Alan was released from the mental hospital and Harley found a letter from Gus telling her goodbye--he was leaving to take care of Alan once and for all. Gus's plan was to force his father , at gunpoint, to sign a confession stating that he'd killed Phillip in cold blood so he'd be sent to jail. Not afraid of Gus, Alan leapt into the front seat and wrestled Gus for his gun, which led to the limo crashing. Gus tried to pull himself out to help Alan but lost consciousness. Alan bandaged Gus's injuries and stole his gun. Gus quickly regained consciousness and fought Alan for the gun when they both saw a shrouded, hooded figure in the distance. Meanwhile, Gus got the gun but was too injured to go for help. They argued about Alan leaving to get help. Gus refused to let him leave, but Alan told him that he wouldn't allow his son to die. Gus was doubtful because of what Alan did to Phillip but Alan vows to never do something like that again. Against his better judgment, Gus let him leave. Later, Alan returned with water but double-crossed Gus by taking the gun. He then prepared to leave Gus behind, bitterly stating that none of his sons cared about him. At that moment, Alan was struck from behind.\n\nA month later, in 2006, Gus finally woke up to find himself in an old cottage in the wilderness. Having no clue what happened, Gus, whose leg was still injured, stumbled out of his bed and found a sleeping Alan in the next room. He woke up Alan who had no idea how they got to the cabin. Finding the door to the outside room locked, the confused pair theorized that someone brought them there was keeping them captive. With Alan's help, Gus escaped through the bedroom window and ended up in the kitchen where he found a cell phone. Although he was able to dial Harley's number, Zach answered the phone and the call was suddenly terminated. Just then the battery died and so Gus wasn't able to try again. As Gus struggled to leave the cabin he came face to face with their captor---Beth! Beth told both men that she was the shadowing figure they saw trailing them, since she followed them out of concern about what Gus might to do Alan. She then explained that she found them unconscious and dragged them to this fully stocked cabin. Unfortunately, a huge snowstorm came and made the roads impassable. At that point, Alan tried to talk her into escaping with him and leaving Gus behind, leading Gus to think this had been a set up all along. But Beth stated that they were all trapped. Several days later, Alan discovered a recently dated store receipt and realized that Beth has been out shopping - which meant her story was a lie. Alan confronted Beth about her lies and she admitted that she has been to town.. Suddenly, the two were face to face with a very angry Beth Raines. Although Alan suspected that Beth had reverted to her other personality, Lorelei, she immediately squashed that theory and proclaimed that this was the new Beth who was in control of her life.\n\nLater, although Beth drugged Alan into near-catatonia, he managed to untie Gus, who, limping on one leg, escaped. Unfortunately, he didn't get very far and Beth dragged him back in the cabin. Although Alan tried to manipulate Beth into letting them go, she didn't take the bait and informed him that he and Gus had been declared dead and Dinah Marler was now heading his company. Finally having enough of both men, Beth decided to leave them to perish. However, she came back unexpectedly with startling news for Alan--she was pregnant! Apparently the tryst they both shared right before New Year's Eve (a last ditch effort from Beth to prove her loyalty to Alan, who she learned was about to divorce her) Alan agreed to cover for her in exchange for her saving his life. Later, Harley and Mallet finally located the cabin but were told by Alan and Beth that Gus had died. However, Harley suspected that they were lying and on a hunch, Harley had Marina trace the number which took her to a mental hospital. At the same time, Alan figured out that Harley had gotten hold of his cell phone and called the guard, telling him to shoot on sight. However, Harley got the upper hand, disarmed the guard, and came face to face with Gus. Back in Springfield, Gus made a deal with Alan--if Alan left Harley alone; Gus wouldn't press charges against Beth for kidnapping. Although Alan could have pressed charges against Gus for kidnapping also, he realized they were at a stalemate and agreed.\n\nUnfortunately, Gus's imprisonment left with an injured leg and an addiction to pain medication. Gus's pill-popping didn't go unnoticed by Dinah who promptly informed Harley. When Harley confronted him about why he was still taking the pills, he insisted it was no big deal and gave them to her, saying he didn't really need them. However, that day, at Cedars, Gus saw a set of pills. Unable to resist, he grabbed them, despite Dinah's efforts to stop him. Gus's reliance on the pills was becoming more and more noticeable, though he kept insisting to Harley that he didn't have a problem. However, it was clearly getting to Gus. Later, Harley dragged Gus to see Rick and check out his bum leg. Gus declared that the whole thing was a set-up to cross-examine him about the pain pills and that his own wife didn't trust him! Again, Gus insisted that he didn't have a problem, but Harley wasn't convinced. Meanwhile, Mallet called Gus to join him in interviewing the mechanic of Ross's downed plane, but Gus couldn't think straight and Mallet wound up getting shot in the shoulder. Realizing Gus was high, Harley had him checked into rehab. Realizing Gus was high, Harley had him checked into rehab. A day later, Gus checked himself out and told Harley he'd get help--just not there. He wanted to be with her at the cabin where he was held. With Harley's help, Gus was able to get through his withdrawal symptoms, but then she was suddenly called away on an emergency. At the end, though, Gus came out healthier for it and he and Harley returned home to their kids. Throughout all this, the police had ruled that Ross's plane might not have gone done by accident. The prime suspect was Alan-Michael whom the police suspected had the plane sabotaged. Despite Mallet's concerns, Dinah refused to stay out of the investigation and was determined to nail Alan-Michael.\n\nLater, Gus, Harley and Mallet learned that Dinah disappearedso had Mallet's gun. Realizing that she'd gone to a resort in San Gabriel after Alan-Michael, the group rushed there to find her before she did something rash. There, Gus and Harley snooped around Ross's suite and found a private investigator's business card (the same P.I. who died in the crash with Ross). After having called the number and spoken with the P.I.'s partner, they received a fax about the case she was working on. The fax contained a photo of Phillip! Apparently, Alan's original statement was correct--Phillip was alive. Harley guessed that Ross found out Phillip was alive, and was trying to find him to convince him to come home when somebody stopped him. Gus and Harley then learned Alan and Beth have come down to San Gabriel and decide to confront them. Alan stated that Phillip was alive and reminded them that he told everyone that over a year ago. However, he stated that he hadn't heard from Phillip since the winter he disappeared from the warehouse and so had nothing to do with Ross's plane going down. At that point, Rick arrived and confessed that he was the one, at Phillip's request, who made sure Ross's plane was sabotaged. He admitted that the plane was never meant to take off; the crash was never meant to happen. He then confessed that he lied last year when he stated that he exhumed Phillip's body.\n\nAt the same time, Gus overheard another revelation--while he was presumed dead, Harley and Mallet had a one night stand. The shock caused Gus to go back to the pills. A few days later, Harley realized Gus had gone back to the pills. When she confronted him about being stoned, he informed her that he knew about her and Mallet. Harley tried to get Gus to see that in her time of grief, she needed someone. Gus demanded to know if Harley could have slept with anyone, or did it have to be Mallet? Knowing Gus couldn't be on the force in his condition, Harley placed a call to Frank who suspended him. That day, Gus came upon Harley on Main Street and lit into her for contacting Frank. As Harley tried to convince him that he was in no condition to be on the force and needed help, he accused her of being concerned about Mallet, not him. As the weeks went by, Gus continually refused Harley's help. Fed up with him using her affair as an excuse, Harley told him he was on own; she was leaving town with the kids. While she was gone, Gus got his act together. Weeks later, Harley slipped into town and watched Gus from a distance to make sure he was alright. It didn't take long to realize that he was and they reunited at the site of the home that he built for her.\n\nHis marriage back on track, Gus found a chance to get his career back on track when he came across Frank on Main Street, as Gus was asking Frank again for his job back; Mallet was asking Frank to be his best man. By this time, it was apparent to Frank that Gus was clean but he still needed to know if he and Mallet could work together. To prove he could work with Mallet, Gus volunteered to be best man at his wedding also. Mallet agreed not only to let Gus be in his party, but to partner with him again. Soon after, while raiding a drug dealer's apartment, Gus and Harley found an abandoned baby. Since the police department was swamped, they brought the baby home for night. The whole family fell in love with the little girl, whom they called Gracie. The next day, the baby (whose name was Sydney) was turned over to her grandmother. Spending time with Gracie got both Gus and Harley thinking about parenthood and they decided to try having a baby of their own. Although there were obstacles, namely friends and family who kept barging in talking about their problems, Harley and Gus were elated when Harley became pregnant. Unfortunately, it turned out to be a false alarm.\n\nIn the meantime, Gus and Harley learned that Sydney's., grandmother had died and the baby was to placed in foster care. After learning that he couldn't have children, Gus kidnapped the baby from the police station and later suggested to Harley that they could adopt the girl. Appalled at the kidnapping, Harley was still intrigued. However, there was now a kidnapping charge to contend with. So Harley and Gus went on Dinah's new TV show \"Light of Springfield\" and told their story hoping the authorities would take pity on them. It worked; the charges were dropped and the Aitoros were named Sydney's legal guardians. In 2007, Gus and Harley prepared for the custody hearing with help from their attorney, Jeffrey. When Jeffrey explained that he'd need to get a statement from Susan, Harley's first-born. Harley left a message for her, and then admitted to Gus that she'd been out of touch with her. Gus suggested they pay a surprise visit to Susan at school. However, when they arrived, Susan wasn't in her dorm room. Not only that, but apparently she was going by Daisy now and was not the sweet, innocent girl that Harley thought. Daisy's friend suggested that she might be with a boy named Ryan, who in turn told the pair that Daisy hung out with older guys and made periodic visits to Springfield. Harley was devastated to learn that Daisy had made several visits to town, to see Reva, not her. Harley emailed Daisy asking her to come home ASAP. Not long after, Tammy Winslow was struck down by a car. At the scene, Gus found a strung out Daisy passed out in the back seat of the car. A fter lying to Frank that there was no one in the car, Gus spirited Daisy off to the Beacon without informing Harley. He then took Daisy's stash of drugs and informed her that her boyfriend, Gillespie, had struck her cousin, Tammy Winslow. While Daisy defended Gillespie and was certain that he'd done it by accident, Gus tried to convince her that her that he was a criminal who didn't care about her.Meanwhile, Harley finally spotted Daisy in town, and so Daisy claimed she was there for Tammy's funeral. Though Daisy tried to decline testifying at the custody battle, she was forced to comply.\n\nFinally, the day of the custody hearing finally arrived. Though Daisy was uneasy about testifying, Harley told her it was necessary and tried to assure her that everything would be fine. Unfortunately, the Driscoll's attorney, Donovan, uncovered evidence linking Daisy to Gillespie. On the witness stand, Daisy first tried to deny knowing him and then was forced to admit she was Gillespie's girlfriend. Having caught her in a lie, Donovan tried to paint Daisy as a junkie and even suggested that she may have been driving the car that struck Tammy. Suddenly, Gus got up and stated that he had proof that Daisy was not driving. He then confessed to finding her at the scene strung out in the back seat. While court was in recess, Harley blasted Gus for keeping this from her; Gus defended himself by stating that he was only trying to protect Daisy. After expressing concerns that Harley's absentee parenting had an adverse affect on Daisy, the judge called it a day. Though Harley denied it, Daisy was certain she blamed her for losing Sydney and decided to make sure the Aitoros got their daughter by propositioning Donovan. After securing a fake ID, Daisy got into Outskirts and flirtatiously told Donovan she'd do whatever it took to help Harley get Sydney. Donovan agreed to meet her in his room. In the meantime, Harley learned that Daisy had not gone back to boarding school like she had thought and went looking for her. Harley went to Outskirts and ended up finding Daisy in Donovan's room ready to seduce Donovan. At that point, custody of Sydney was awarded to the Driscolls and Harley decided to enroll Daisy in school in Springfield.\n\nUnfortunately, Daisy continued to clash with an overeager Harley who continued to do things that infuriated Daisysuch as when she invited a guy (Bobby) to Daisy's prom. At the same time, Daisy continued to bond with Gus. Later, Daisy's father, Dylan returned to town. When the Harley went to find Daisy, they were shocked to see she'd snuck out. She, Dylan and Gus (whom Dylan immediately clashed with) finally found Daisy hanging out with Leah and Harley lit into Daisy for sneaking out. Though Gus tried to diffuse the situation by talking Harley down, Dylan defended Harley and mildly scolded Daisy. Meanwhile, Bobby came over to apologize for standing up Daisy at the school dance and invited Daisy to the library. Daisy reluctantly agreed and later called Harley and Gus for help when she was with an unconscious Bobby in a hotel room. Daisy stated that Bobby tried to rape her and so she drugged his drink and he passed out. When Bobby woke up, he told a different story and Harley believed his version. Though both Gus and Frank thought Daisy was telling the truth, Harley was convinced she needed discipline and put Daisy in jail overnight to teach her a lesson. Later, when she got out, Daisy refused to speak to her mother and went to Reva's to ask to move in with her. However, Harley wouldn't allow it and forced Daisy to come back home. After a few weeks, Gus tried to convince Daisy to talk to her mother, but Daisy refused. Meanwhile, as Harley and Gus argued about Daisy (mainly about Gus being too lenient), they realized that Harley's car was gone. Not only that but so were Daisy and Zach. Suddenly, they heard about a slight accident and rushed to the scene. Though Gus tried to downplay the situation by pointing out that everyone was fine, Harley was furious and accused Daisy of endangering her little brother's life. Harley then announced that she was sending Daisy to boot camp for six weeks. Daisy looked for Gus to help her but he kept silent.\n\nDaisy begged for another chance but Harley had enough and Daisy was dragged from the house by the supervisor of the boot camp. Later, despite Reva and Daisy's wishes, Harley was adamant about her going to boot camp and decided to drive her there. However, an emergency with Jude forced Harley to stay home and Gus volunteered to drive her. They stopped at a motel for the night, The next morning, Harley got a visit from Dylan who informed her that he was moving back to town permanently.. He also expressed his concerns about Gus, a former drug addict,, being around Daisy. As Harley was defending Gus, she got a call that Gus was hospitalized following a fire in the motel. With Dylan, Harley rushed to the hospital and learned that Daisy identified herself as Gus's girlfriend. Daisy stated that she only did that to get information on his condition. When Dylan asked if the fire was Gus's fault, Daisy stated that Gus took some pain pills that night and passed out. Dylan took that to mean that Gus was high, but Harley continued to defend her husband. When Gus woke up, he implied that the fire was his fault. Afterwards, Harley reconsidered her plan to send Daisy away. Days later, when Gus was released, Dylan unexpectedly tried to attack Gus. Incensed, Harley confronted Dylan who informed her that the tox test at the hospital confirmed that Gus was on drugs that night. He then showed Harley a disturbing videoblog in which Daisy is confessing her love for Gus. While Dylan believed that Gus instigated these feelings, Harley still defended Gus. After going back inside, she kept an eye on the pair and couldn't help notice that while Daisy was attempting to get physically close to Gus, he kept moving away. Harley then went to Gus who finally told her that the night of the fire, Daisy had told him that she loved him.\n\nDuring their discussion, they realized that Daisy must have drugged Gus that night and the pair confronted her. Days later, Gus and Harley found out that Daisy had been cutting school and gotten a traffic ticket in Chicago. Since this was a violation of her parole, Daisy was called before the judge. Asked how she, as an officer of the law, would give Daisy direction, Harley confessed that she could no longer handle her daughter. The judge took Harley's words to heart and sentenced Daisy to three months in juvenile detention. Though Harley tried to tell the judge that was not what she meant, his decision was final and Daisy demanded to be sent to detention ASAP rather than spend one more minute with her mother.\n\nLater that day, Gus and Harley went to a party for Josh at Company and Buzz introduced them to his newest employeeNatalia. Harley was surprised that Gus and the new waitress seemed to know each other and Gus stated that they were childhood friends. Afterwards, Gus confessed to Harley that Natalia was more than a childhood friendshe was his first love. Harley was frequently worried that Natalia might still want Gus. Then Harley saw Natalia at juvenile hall, Though Natalia claimed to be visiting Daisy, Harley was suspicious and accused her of using her family to go after Gus. Again Natalia insisted that she was not after Gus but Harley didn't believe her and got Buzz to fire her. Meanwhile, at juvenile hall, Gus came across an altercation between an inmate named Rafe and a guard. Upon seeing that Rafe had the guard's gun, Gus pulled out his own gun to talk Rafe down, Harley ran in and shouted that the boy was his son! Almost immediately after, Natalia arrived and Gus demanded to hear the truth from her. Natalia admitted that it was true; it happened when he left Chicago and she had no clue where he was. Meanwhile, Buzz hired Natalia back and told her it was Harley's idea. Later, Gus testified on his son's behalf and Rafe was released from juvie. Upon learning that Natalia had gotten an apartment in a rough neighborhood, which is all she could afford, Gus suggested that Rafe live with him and Harley for a year. Unfortunately, it was not a smooth transition for anyone and tensions quickly rose in the Aitoro home. After money was stolen from a jar in the house, Harley spotted Rafe's hand in the jar and blasted him for the theft. Soon after, Harley walked in on Rafe kissing Daisy and immediately thought the worst and pulled Rafe off of her. Rafe ran out and Daisy tried to tell Harley that Rafe didn't steal the money. Daisy then blurted out that she was in love with Rafe. Apparently, the pair had met in juvenile detention. Everyone objected to the teens living under the same roof and dating at the same time. Harley insisted that Rafe move out but Daisy volunteered to live with Dylan. Afterwards, Harley informed Gus that Daisy would be moving back in, thus Rafe had to move out.\n\nThis added more tension to her marriage since Gus accused her of putting her child before his. A few weeks later, Gus walked in to find Dylan kissing Harley. Tensions between he and Dylan already high for weeks, Gus punched Dylan and when Harley let it slip that this wasn't the first kiss, Gus went ballistic and beat Dylan to a pulp. The commotion frightened Harley's son, Jude, who called the police. When the police arrived, Harley insisted that it was a family dispute and later went to Dylan's to beg him not to press charges against Gus since it could cost him his job. Days later, things came to a head when Gus wanted to spend a family dinner with Rafe and Natalia and the Spaulding mansion and Harley wanted them to dine with Daisy and Dylan. Neither would budge and Harley ended up leaving while Gus stayed at the mansion. It was becoming more apparent to Natalia that Gus's marriage was on shaky ground. To Natalia, Harley was being unreasonable. After commiserating with Natalia, Gus got a call from Alan at Towers and overheard Dylan offering to take Harley to his place. Upset, he went to Dylan's and was shocked to see the pair in bed together. Gus snuck out unseen and wound up finding comfort in Natalia's arms. In quick order, Alan (who made no secret that he thought Harley was bad for his son) informed Harley that Gus slept with Natalia. Harley asked Natalia who could just look guilty. Realizing it was true, a horrified Harley left town and resisted all of Gus's efforts to find her. As a frustrated Gus tried to contact Harley, Natalia informed him that she still loved him and would fight for him. As the weeks went by, Gus continued to bond with Natalia and he admitted that he could see a future with her.\n\nAt that point, Harley finally returned home and after an argument with Gus informed her that she never slept with Dylan. She had simply passed out in his bed. However, Gus had slept with Natalia and that was something Harley found hard to forgive so Gus moved out. Unfortunately, he moved into the Spaulding mansion. Though Gus tried to argue that he wanted to be near his son, Harley found it unacceptable. Later, while telling Cassie about what happened on the night she passed out, Harley realized that she did not have enough to drink to pass out the way she did. Cassie suspected that someone must have drugged Harley's drink. The likely suspects were Dylan, Alan or Natalia. Harley immediately asked for a drug test which came back positive (since Valium takes a while to leave the bloodstream). Though she initially accused Natalia, suspicion soon turned to Alan and he confessed. Soon after, Harley and Gus tried to put their marriage back together by renewing their vows. Unfortunately, Alan ruined things by giving Gus a false message that Rafe was ill; causing Gus to miss the ceremony. Unable to trust that Gus would put her before Natalia, Harley told Gus it was over.\n\nIn the meantime, Phillip apparently made his presence known by sending Olivia's daughter, Emma, a present for her 7th birthday. Horrified, Olivia went to Gus with her fears that Phillip would return and take Emma. After failing to reassure Olivia that he doubted that Phillip would return, Gus agreed to install a security system in her room. At the same time, Gus decided to annul his marriage. While looking over the papers, he received a call stating that Harley (who'd been trying to locate Marina) had been rescued from the rubble of an demolished church. Gus rushed to Cedars as Harley was being released to see if she was alright. As Gus offered to take Harley home and take care of her, she saw the papers sticking out of his pocket. Grabbing them, she was shocked to see they were annulment papers. Distressed, she asked if Gus knew what an annulment meant. It meant that the marriage never happened. It never mattered. Gus tried to convince her that it was not as callous as it sounded but Harley simply told him she'd think about it. Days later, Gus had a change of heart and suggested that they tear up the annulment papers since he did not like the idea of someone saying their marriage never existed. However, by now all the fight was out of Harley and she insisted that the annulment go through so that he could have a family with Natalia and Rafe. Harley and Gus later met with Father Ray to discuss the annulment. Suddenly, Harley got a frantic call and quickly signed the annulment papers before rushing out. Gus took the papers to the mansion and as he was about to sign, Natalia arrived and tore them up stating that she didn't want him to annul his marriage for her sake. Later, Gus decided to put his marriage in the past by filing for divorce and focused on the future by asking Natalia to marry him.\n\nSoon after, Natalia formally accepted his proposal. Later, Gus came upon a weeping Olivia in her room with the door ajar. Concerned, he asked what the matter was and Olivia told Gus her she was just diagnosed with a serous heart condition: her heart was failing.Wanting to help, Gus later offered to take Olivia to the hospital for her doctor's appointment. At the hospital, Gus tried to use the Spaulding name to get Olivia's name moved to the top of the heart transplant list. In the meantime, he lied to Natalia about where he was going, only to have her spot him leaving with Olivia. Later, Natalia called Gus on the lie and warned him tat Olivia was a troublemaker. Without giving away Olivia's secret, Gus assured Natalia that she had nothing to be jealous about. He continued to be a supportive friend to Olivia, even drawing up papers for Bill's adoption of Emma to be revoked. Meanwhile, Gus and Harley's divorce officially went through. Meanwhile, Gus and Olivia's friendship was growing and she tried to convince him that Harley was still in love with him. In 2008, Gus continued to plan his wedding to Natalia while trying to get Olivia's name on the top of the heart transplant list. Later, Natalia called Olivia out on purposefully trying to mess with the wedding and when Gus defended Olivia, Nat called the wedding off. Gus quickly got in Nat's good graces and convinced her to elope with him. Unfortunately, just as they were about to go to Chicago, a frantic Ava called and asked if Gus could talk to Olivia's doctors. Gus left Natalia to be with a worried Olivia. When Nat saw the pair together, she angrily confronted Olivia who finally confessed to Nat that she was dying. Shocked, Natalia told Gus that they could put off the wedding and resolved to help Olivia as well.\n\nMeanwhile, Natalia overheard Olivia and Alan discuss Olivia breaking up Nat and Gus and confronted Olivia. Olivia confessed to Gus and Natalia that she and Alan had made a deal---in exchange for protection against Phillip, Olivia agreed to drive a wedge between Gus and Natalia. Gus and Nat instantly forgave her since they figured Alan was more to blame. Soon after, Gus and Natalia married in a small ceremony. Immediately after, Gus got a call from the heart bank saying that a heart had been found for Olivia but she never responded to their pages. At that point, Natalia confessed to locking Olivia in the bathroom in order to keep her from stopping the wedding. Gus rushed to get Olivia out and was forced to tell her that the bank had given the heart away because she never responded. Upset with Nat, Gus decided to spend his wedding night comforting Olivia. Remorseful that she cost Olivia her chance at getting a heart, Natalia apologized to both Gus and Olivia. Afterwards, Natalia told Gus to devote all of his energies to Olivia. One day, talk turned to Harley and Olivia pointed out that although she could understand Gus missing his passion with Harley she couldn't understand him settling with Natalia. Olivia's talk of passion and wanting to feel alive must have affected Gus since he passionately kissed her before walking out. That day, Gus learned devastating news from Olivia doctor. Though Olivia didn't want to hear it, Gus was forced to tell her that she had mere weeks, maybe even days to live. Soon after, Gus promised Nat that once this situation with Olivia ended, he was going to devote himself to her; to prove that to her, he bought her a house.\n\nMeanwhile, with Alan's help, Gus found out about a doctor in Europe who had experimental, and very risky, drug but Olivia didn't want to spend her last days out of town. Days later, Olivia arranged for a surprise weddingshe wanted to spend her last days as Mrs. Gus Aitoro. Though Olivia argued that it wouldn't be a real marriage, Gus couldn't do that to Natalia and refused. However, he did Gus arrange to have Olivia's memory honored by having a park named in her honor. Meanwhile, Alan was arrested when the police found evidence of financial fraud at the Spaulding mansion. Alan was convinced that Phillip set him up and asked Gus to help him. Although Gus initially refused, he later decided to help his father. The following day, Gus came across a destitute Alan. Alan and Gus seemed to bond and Gus offered to help Alan out with some money and left the room to make arrangements, leaving his cell phone behind. When he returned he offered to buy his father lunch. At lunch, Alan admitted to Gus that he was glad he found him and Gus admitted that, despite what Alan may have thought, Gus did always want a relationship with his father. Unfortunately, the mood was spoiled when Gus's phone rangit was a frantic Ava telling him that Olivia was in the hospital near death. Ava let it slip that Jeffrey called earlier and left a message with Alan. Yelling that Alan would never change, Gus rushed out but returned soon after since his car wouldn't start. Nearby, Remy let Gus borrow his motorcycle and Gus sped off to be near Olivia.\n\nTragically, Gus got in a serious accident on the way to Cedars. Before being rushed into surgery, Gus saw Harley one last time. When a tearful Harley admitted that he was the love of her life, he admitted that she was his as well. Also on hand was a tearful Natalia and Gus implored her not to cry as he was wheeled into surgery. Unfortunately, the extent of Gus's head injury was too severe and he died on the operating table. When he proved to be a match for Olivia, Natalia reluctantly agreed for Olivia to receive his heart. Weeks later, Harley returned to the force and began working on Gus's still open cases. Soon, Harley suspected that Gus had so many unsolved cases because a leak in the department was obstructing them. Harley took her suspicions of a crooked cop to Mallet and to Jeffrey who both agreed to look into it. However, Mallet already figured out who the crooked cop was--Gus himself. Eager to save his friend's reputation, and his pension for Natalia's sake, Mallet shredded the evidence of Gus's involvement and attempted to stall Jeffrey's investigation. Finally, Harley herself put it all together when she learned from Alan that someone named within Gus's case wasn't a criminalhe was a defense attorney: Fred Grundy. Harley paid Grundy a visit and saw a plaque from the American Heart Association on his desk. Suddenly, Harley put the pieces together: Gus was doing favors to move Olivia up the transplant list.\n\nGus Aitoro rode into Springfield with a score to settle. Along the way he found the love of his life, Harley Cooper, and a dysfunctional family in the Spauldings. A passionate man with dogged determination, Gus had a compassionate side that surprised many. That compassion caused him to spend the last few months of his life helping Olivia Spencer who had been diagnosed with a failing heart. In the end, after a tragic accident, Gus would give Olivia the greatest gift of all-his own heart."
