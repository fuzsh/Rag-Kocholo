        "text": "Scene II Begins: Same day. Michelle enters the kitchen without Robbie, Danny is staring out the window, arms crossed, deep in thought, she‚Äôs worried and approaches him cautiously, with a soft voice.\n\nMichelle: I‚Äôm sorry Danny, it‚Äôs just‚Ä¶ (She‚Äôs right behind him)\n\nDanny: Just what, Michelle?‚Ä¶( he turns to face her, voice raised) You know you snooping around and questioning Carmen and then colluding with Aituro is just asking for trouble! You know‚Ä¶(lowers voice) you know what Carmen is capable of. Honey, I wish you would just stop it, stop it before‚Ä¶\n\nMichelle: Before what? (angrily) before Carmen strikes again?! I can‚Äôt stop, I won‚Äôt stop! Danny we need to know what happened that night, at that warehouse and if Carmen‚Äôs behind this, then she‚Äôll pay and maybe this time, she‚Äôll be out of our hair for good! My God, Danny you were almost killed!\n\nDanny: But I wasn‚Äôt see, I‚Äôm fine!\n\nMichelle: Yeah, this time!\n\nDanny: I‚Äôm fine and you‚Äôre not hearing me (sternly) Drop it!\n\n(Michelle is frightened at Danny‚Äôs anger and backs off, but only for a moment!)\n\nMichelle: (Calmly) What are you afraid of Danny, huh?\n\nDanny: Michelle, stop! This is not open for discussion, do I make myself clear?\n\nMichelle: (mumbles) Crystal. (pauses) All right, OK, I‚Äôll drop it, for now.\n\n(Danny puts on jacket, leather one, and grabs his brief case!)\n\nMichelle: Where are you going, I thought you had the day off?\n\nDanny: I‚Äôm going to Inferno, Tony needs help with the audit!\n\nMichelle: But, but I thought‚Ä¶\n\n(Danny leans in for a kiss)\n\nDanny: I‚Äôm sorry, babe‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm sorry I yelled.

(smiles)\n\nDanny: Well, I think (kiss) we could manage to find other ways (kiss) to have fun! (big sexy grin)\n\nMichelle: Mmmm, like tonight, maybe? It being a special night and all!\n\nDanny: I don‚Äôt know how special tonight is, but I think I‚Äôm going to be at Inferno for most of it, so don‚Äôt worry about me and dinner, I can grab something there. I‚Äôll probably be late. I‚Äôll call. See ya, (kiss) I love you! (voice trails as he walks out the door)\n\nMichelle: (standing at the door) Yeah sweetheart, see ya, love you too! (Slams door, turns facing kitchen, obviously annoyed) That, that‚Ä¶.\n\nRick: (Enters kitchen, book in hand) That, that, what?\n\nThis is the nineteenth in an irregular feature where we will report updates on what cast members of Guiding Light are doing now.

The May 18, 2010 issue of Soap Opera Digest interviewed Ryan Brown (Bill Lewis III, who played Little Billy during the Bilar romance which crossed heavily with Manny). Brown has published his first novel called Play Dead.\n\nFind it on Amazon here:\n\nhttp://www.amazon.com/Play-Dead-Ryan-Brown/dp/1439171572/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1288583889&sr=8-1\n\nIn the interview Brown says he isn‚Äôt in regular contact with any of his former co-stars, but sometimes runs into Paul Anthony Stewart (Danny Santos) and saw Paula Garces (Pilar Santos) during an audition a few years ago.

This was the second year in a row where the Bauer BBQ wasn‚Äôt even held at the Bauer House. Maybe that‚Äôs why Rick seems so out of it in his planning in 2009? Maybe he was out of practice?\n\nAnyway during the Bauer BBQ in 2007, Beth (who thought she was pregnant with Rick‚Äôs child via their pretty hot affair while he was married to Mel ‚Äì wish they hadn‚Äôt rushed through so much of it in one ‚ÄúInside the Light‚Äù episode) impulsively married Rick. Their marriage fell apart over two big problems. 1. Rick had found out that Beth‚Äôs daughter, the future Peyton Spaulding, wasn‚Äôt his (Cassie changed the paternity results to keep the child away from Alan, partly from revenge for Tammy and partly because she believed Alan was a danger to it) and didn‚Äôt tell Beth. 2. Beth really never got over Phillip. Rick was never enough. Beth wanted Phillip & the closest she could get was adding Rick & Alan (which when you think about it would be pretty darn close to Phillip) so she waffles back and forth trying to have both for quite awhile. Her next attempt at romance would be with a young writer who made her feel secure, Coop Cooper (anybody else still sensing the not really over Phillip yet pattern in that?).\n\nLizzie‚Äôs comment to Alan about Gus is because while Gus is dead Alan thinks he‚Äôs been getting messages from him. He uses his ‚Äúpowers‚Äù for good and to raise capital. However, it is later revealed that it was really a medical issue that almost killed him. Alan falling down the basement steps is a further symptom of this illness.\n\nCash are tiptoeing around each other as they try to get over serious arguments about life decisions Cassie has been making. However, what she really needs is serious counseling over Tammy‚Äôs death and what she allowed to happen to Will and how her decisions impacted her sister. Lacking that their marriage never stood a chance. Ironically the true love of Cassie‚Äôs life, Richard, denied this very help to his brother Edmund which is why Edmund spent the last 10 years tormenting Springfield.\n\nThey threw us a Bauer bone though. I appreciate the call at the beginning from Ed and Rick sending his love to Danny, Michelle, and the kids. They really did do a good job implying Rick spent a lot of his time off camera in California spoiling Robbie and Hope rotten, teaching Robbie magic tricks, and using Hope as an excuse to still do childish things.\n\nDinah had arranged to take over Spaulding Enterprises and the Spaulding Mansion as part of an elaborate plan to get revenge on Alan and to prove that she wasn‚Äôt somebody to be pitied after she recovered from the brain damage she received taking a bullet to save Mallet‚Äôs life. She turned it all over to Bill who kicked the Spauldings out even though he was strongly drawn to Lizzie. He was ambitiously trying to run for Governor with his ‚Äúperfect‚Äù family. The day before was Bava‚Äôs wedding. Lizzie told him right before the ceremony that the child Ava was carrying wasn‚Äôt his. Ava slept with Bill, Remy one time, and visited a fertility clinic. Once the baby is born it is clearly Remy‚Äôs.\n\nI don‚Äôt remember why the Spauldings are living in Harley‚Äôs house, except they were kicked out of the Spaulding Mansion by Dinah Marler and TPTB didn‚Äôt want to have to build another set. I don‚Äôt remember what the official excuse was. Harley was on the run with Rafe (Gus‚Äôs long lost son) after Rafe, in what can only be described as a fit, shot Jeffery O‚ÄôNeill for blackening his father‚Äôs name (which he wasn‚Äôt doing). They are currently hiding in Greece.\n\nWatch for a few scenes of Rick actually parenting Jude. Blink and you might miss them. After the years we spent watching Rick yearn for a child to carry on his special relationship with Bert. Did these writers ever, you know, ever actually watch the show? (Shakes head.)\n\nWhy would Gus want the Spauldings at the BAUER BBQ? Gus‚Äôs relationship with the Bauers was love-hate at best. Danny he eventually settled down to a prickly friendly-ish relationship, but Michelle didn‚Äôt like him, Rick hated him, and Meta isn‚Äôt there. Phillip would have wanted his family at the BBQ, but I think Gus would have been happier to have them at a Cubs game.\n\nAlso, listen to Mallet‚Äôs speech which is a good one although I don‚Äôt know why he‚Äôs the one who‚Äôs making it. They really thought Mallet was the person to make that annual speech. Mallet? Really? Even Josh made more sense and Rick was freaking standing RIGHT THERE!\n\nI didn‚Äôt catch that the first time. Cassie and Marina both made cherry pies (nobody made Bert‚Äôs apple pie this year?) and Mallet totally dissed Marina saying how great Cassie‚Äôs was. That was worth watching right there! I got so sick of them trying to push Mallet and his GODDAUGHTER/WIFE Marina down our throats. Next comes Bizzie-Bava tension, Rick and Beth starting to make up, and some pretty darn explicit Lillibuzz.\n\nThe complete episode link below is much clearer and has some additional scenes (and includes the phone call from Ed, with a Manny reference), but I left the multi-part version I found first in case the shorter clumps were easier for anyone to watch.\n\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6kDouByDapo (Complete Episode ‚Äì Digital copy)\n\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKWC1pUD0Vw&feature=related (Part 1)\n\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dsj-9XGsF7g&feature=related (Part 2)\n\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfRMddgsCHI&feature=related (Part 3)\n\nTonight‚Äôs commentary is a little snarkier than normal and I honestly don‚Äôt mean to offend anybody if we disagree, but the 2006 storylines bring it out in me.\n\nIt‚Äôs the year after Manny move to California to be near Ed. Bauer BBQ in a properly decorated Bauer house and yard for the last time. [Bitter, bitter SOB!] Mel and Rick are having tensions in their marriage because Phillip Spaulding‚Äôs meltdown and death/disappearance have really effected Rick in a way Mel can‚Äôt share and they increasingly grow more distant. (Frankly I never thought they had much heat to begin with, when my favorite scene with them involves them giggling over trying to get Danny & Michelle together when they‚Äôve already reached that inevitable conclusion themselves, there‚Äôs not much to be said for them as couple. I thought he had more heat with Harley which was pathetically little at that. Mel certainly never had the same fire she later showed in the last couple of scenes with Cyrus and that was before they literally broke the bed.) In another tragic decision for longtime viewers, Leah (who in a Marah copycat move has her name from the combination of Rick and Mel‚Äôs mothers‚Äôs names, Leslie and Felicia) turned 16 instead of 2. So after having watched Rick pine after children for years, we don‚Äôt actually get to see him spend much time parenting either Jude or Leah. Leah is especially given the short shift. She is rarely seen and frequently recast in the last 3 years of the show. At least I think she was, we saw so little of her you kind of forget exactly what she looked like in between. The business with her and Rick and the hat during Bauer BBQ 2009 was cute, but would have meant a lot more if we had ever, you know, heard of the tradition before that.\n\nAva, who in a presto changeo move was suddenly the girl next door, not an ambitious flakey nut job for about 2 seconds until Coop dumps her and she reverts, had successfully lured Coop away from the closest he will ever know to a true love in Lizzie. They had a beautiful romance until the writers blew it up, I guess just because they wanted to give Ava story. It‚Äôs not like Ava and Coop had much connection that wasn‚Äôt forced either, unlike Cozzie or pre-surgery Cooplee in my never humble opinion. Also, the Coopers supporting Ava was ridiculous when they practically helped raised Lizzie, back when Marina was her friend and not a lying witch who stabbed more friends than Lizzie in the back. Anyway, so the Coopers are happy Coop is with Ava, but this is a recent development. Lizzie had gotten pregnant off of a one night stand with Jonathan Randall and originally claimed the baby was Coop‚Äôs. She took it all the way to the altar before Jonathan suddenly outed her. Alan, who is more than a little mentally ill at the moment and perhaps developing some early signs of the brain tumor that will almost kill him in a couple of years, is totally obsessed with getting control of Lizzie‚Äôs baby. So much so that she‚Äôs eventually frightened into letting Jonathan take the baby with no contact rather than see Alan get ahold of her.\n\nJammy people should be happy, this is sort of their highpoint, except for the wedding. I know I‚Äôm swimming against the current here, but I disliked what being with Jonathan did to Tammy. The almost alternative personality he brought out in her was simply unpleasant. She used to be so nice and act like a grown up and a strong woman, now she‚Äôs a I‚Äùm nothing without my man, self-centered hanger-oner, the type of person you avoid at parties. At this point she thinks she can have Jonathan AND a normal life. Good luck with that one, Tammy. Jonathan, who came to town specifically to make his mother pay for abandoning him (he got over it), plans to do the exact same thing to his kid with less excuse and Reva handed the perfect opportunity, doesn‚Äôt call him on it!\n\nReva was diagnosed with cancer and rather than tell Josh, she only confided in Billy and later Jonathan. She left town for treatment, didn‚Äôt give Josh a reasonable excuse for her absence and started pushing him towards Cassie. Which I may have bought back when they were working together over the clone, but Crash makes not sense at this point. So don‚Äôt even try to make it make sense.\n\nRemy is Mel‚Äôs brother and therefore Leah‚Äôs uncle. Remy & Lizzie were always friendly if not really friends. Love it when Remy points out something usually goes wrong every year at BBQ. Remy had kind of crush on Tammy who died before they ever got around to exploring it. His next crush which will be more equally returned will be Ava.\n\nAlthough Olivia is supposed to be with Frank, Buzz and Olivia have sparks when Frank isn‚Äôt around. Until Olivia started dating Frank, Buzz tried to get her to admit her feelings for him. Now he supports Frank. However, the sparks still fly and even Frank (I mean he‚Äôs a good guy, a great community officer, but did the guy ever crack a case? He didn‚Äôt even ID his mother‚Äôs body when it was pulled out of the lake in front of him) notices and has finally had enough. Glad TPTB remember that Buzz rides a motorcycle.\n\nWhat‚Äôs wrong with Gus is that he is a drug addict. Rick was twice an active addict and beat it. Gus should listen to him.\n\nRoss was killed 4 months earlier at the beginning of April this year. That‚Äôs why Blake is having issues.\n\nOnce again, Alan complains about coming to the Bauer BBQ and tends to other business and then BAM there he is! That‚Äôs true every year when Alan is in town. He complains. He pretends he isn‚Äôt going to come. He does something else. Then he comes and thinks it odd if anyone questions him being there. ‚ÄúI come every year,‚Äù he says if asked. üòâ\n\n‚ÄòThis year the annual speech is made by Josh. Really it‚Äôs a nice speech. What Josh is talking about honoring veterans is that he is working at building a VA Hospital on the former site of Cross Creek. This is a never heard of lifelong dream of HB‚Äôs to build one there. Josh told Reva the night she was going to tell him about the cancer, so she didn‚Äôt so Josh didn‚Äôt put his life on hold for her again. (I know I‚Äôm just reporting, I didn‚Äôt write this dreck.) He gets Cassie to help him with it and thus Cash is born.\n\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DdUymVK-nMM&feature=related\n\n(Part 1)\n\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IuVKF6OX5LU&feature=related (Part 2)\n\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZR-N59wlG0&feature=related (Part 3)\n\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aR-N7NEx1_g&feature=related (Part 4)\n\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3HTTDqOOz3k&feature=related (Part 5) Tribute to Ross\n\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YdVCejZn6Vs&feature=fvw (Part 6)\n\nSorry just very selected highlights of this one because it‚Äôs one of my favorite Bauer BBQs. I don‚Äôt know why they never had Danny behind the bar at the BBQ. He does such a good job when he works at Millennium. I just love his speech about the drinks he makes. I think it‚Äôs a total waste of talent and obviously between this and burning the money in San Cristobel it just shows that as much as I love him, the boy can‚Äôt grill. I love his BLACK Hawaiian shirt. I wish he‚Äôd worn it to the last one, I didn‚Äôt really care for his outfit for Bauer BBQ 2009, although once I realized his shorts matched Robbie‚Äôs it grew on me. I could just see Robbie picking them out to be like his Dad. Happy sigh!\n\nTony and Ray are Danny‚Äôs cousins, so now pulled in to helping with the BBQ. Danny is currently being prosecuted for his mother‚Äôs death (which he thinks he did in defense of life but covered it up ‚Äì Carmen really is still alive and the body they pull out of the lake isn‚Äôt hers). FBI Agent Gus Aitoro, who is behind the prosecution, is trying to get Danny because he holds Danny‚Äôs father response for his own father‚Äôs death and Gus intends to get revenge on Danny. (Apparently in all that lawyer learning he got, he skipped the bit in the Constitution about the no contamination of the blood clause ‚Äì meaning that children can‚Äôt be punished for their parent‚Äôs crimes.) Gus is currently working up to romancing Harley who is pregnant with Rick‚Äôs child Jude.\n\nI love Rick‚Äôs little show at the beginning of the clip. They refer back to both Rick‚Äôs wearing the hat and Danny hating the hat and apron when Manny return at Bauer BBQ 2009. Phillip has just returned from San Cristobel where he was trying to rescue Beth and his children and Harley‚Äôs daughter Susan. I think Harley is referring to when Phillip leads a commando style raid to rescue Beth from Edmund. As their marriage broke up, (I will spare Pharley fans my analysis about why it never stood a chance to begin with) in part over Phillip‚Äôs constant efforts to protect Beth, this latest rescue went over like a lead balloon with Harley, even though her own daughter was involved. She is currently pregnant with Rick‚Äôs child, the future Jude Bauer, from a drunken one night stand.\n\nAt this point Blake had published her 2nd book. (Her first book was the romance she imagined between Ross and Holly while she was pregnant with Clarissa and hiding from Ross at the Bauer BBQ.) She had decided to use Selena Davis‚Äôs true life story of a romance with Miguel Santos (which produced a never seen on screen Miguel Santos, Jr.) as the basis of this second book. (When she could have used Manny? Or Jezz? Or Bloss or even Blen? Why Selena?) However, Blake‚Äôs failure to disguise the people involved adequately led to either Abuela or Carmen putting a hit out on Selena. Selena barely made it out of town in time, leaving Buzz heartbroken and beaten by the goons that came after her. Blake is thinking that stirring up the past led to Danny being on the murder charge, hence the apology.\n\nGus has no right to come to Bauer BBQ, but he is starting to chase after Harley, he will ultimately catch her, and he‚Äôs trying to make Danny miserable so he comes. Really Gus is lucky Danny isn‚Äôt the man Gus thinks he is or Gus would be in the lake by now. Lucky for Danny he isn‚Äôt though because later Gus does make some amends for faking evidence against Danny etc., by saving his life from the warehouse fire and they grow to have a more friendly, although still very prickly relationship. Gus should really give up the quips, he‚Äôs no Ben Warren. Currently Gus is making up to Blake hoping to get more information from Selena and find out who Blake‚Äôs source was which nobody will tell him although most of the people we know in town either know or could guess. Not having learned her lesson with Ben Warren, Blake is heavily flirting back to him trying to get information out of him. Ultimately she will turn up the evidence that shows who Gus really is (at least who he thinks he is at this point) and the lengths he will go to try to destroy Danny. BOO GUS! HISSSSS! At this point Bloss and Manny are really each other‚Äôs closest couple friends, although not as close as Dresse and Manny were. Blake and Michelle share the bond that they were once and future step-sisters and I wish the show had played that up more rather than playing Blake as a Thorpe all the time. She was Bauer to in a very real way although her efforts to help Manny get out of legal trouble (which she actually does a couple of times) are as close as they get to playing Blake and Michelle as sisters.\n\nFinally, having survived Selena breaking his heart (I really think he was mostly with Selena to keep himself from dwelling on Jenna being gone and to give her full credit Selena, she was very good with his kids), Buzz was ready to move on to Holly. While Buzz really should have had issues with Holly who‚Äôs actions had helped bring about Jenna‚Äôs death, look around the canvas and there aren‚Äôt a lot of more tenable options. They move into a triangle with Buzz-Holly-Billy. Buzz and Billy were friends because when Billy was released from prison from trying to kill Roger Thorpe, Buzz was supportive and gave Billy a job. They had formed a friendship and I think their love of competing with each other played more into the romance than anything about Holly which is good because she dumped them both flat the SPLIT SECOND Ed returns to town. However, at this point they are still fighting over her. Billy had doctored up a bowl of chili to make it superhot to give to Buzz to keep him away from Holly. Buzz put it down and Gus picked it up and took a huge spoonful. Billy is the only one who understands Gus‚Äôs reaction and that‚Äôs why he‚Äôs laughing his head off.\n\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lJQPfFSRF4I&playnext_from=TL&videos=Qkk6XWU-Bj4&feature=sub\n\nThis is the seventh in an irregular feature where we will report updates on what cast members of Guiding Light are doing now.\n\nTina Sloan (Lillian Raines) has tweeted a tentative schedule for her one woman show Changing Shoes this fall.

Check out the ‚ÄúSoap Opera Jargon‚Äù page for more.\n\nAlmost Wedding ‚Äì An almost wedding is also known as a nonwedding or an interrupted wedding. One of the ways that life in soap world is different from real life is that when you are invited to a wedding in the real world you are pretty much assured that the wedding will actually take place. In soap world you can‚Äôt have the same assurance. In soap world either the bride or groom might not show or someone might show up to stop the wedding or the bride or groom might change their mind. Below are an assortment of GL‚Äôs almost weddings over the years.\n\nIn 1989, Phillip and Blake‚Äôs wedding is interrupted when Alan accidentally shot his son Phillip.\n\nhttp://www.youtube.com/user/soaploversuniversity#p/u/227/4Cnml8Ig3TY\n\nIn 1992, Mindy Lewis and Nick McHenry have an almost wedding when he‚Äôs late and his mother Alex convinces her, he will never forgive her for lying about his true parentage.
