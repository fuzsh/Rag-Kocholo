        "text": "THE SPAULDINGS\n\nALAN SPAULDING\n\nPhillips adoptive father who first lied to his wife about Phillip, and then his son. Phillip became an obsession of hishe loves him deeply yet this love manifests itself in painfully trying to control and run his sons life and relationships.\n\nELIZABETH SPAULDING\n\nPhillips adoptive mother who, for many years, believed he was her biological son. After winning custody of Phillip from Alan, Elizabeth decided that Phillip should be raised by his biological parents, the Marlers, while she went to Switzerland for mental health treatment. She hasnt been heard from since.\n\nALEXANDRA SPAULDING\n\nLujacks mother. Phillips aunt. A complicated woman whose frosty exterior belies the warmth she is capable of inside. She suffered for years, searching for Lujack (her Brandon) after his father Eric took him away from her. She was determined to punish her brother Alan for siding with their fatherand did. Yet the feelings between Alan and Alex run very deep.\n\nBRANDON SPAULDING\n\nAlex and Alans father, Phillip and Lujacks grandfather. A cold man who was emotionally abusive to Alan (locking him in a closet) and who sabotaged his daughters life by taking her son away from her.\n\nPENELOPE SPAULDING\n\nAlex and Alans mother, who died giving birth to Alan.\n\nALAN-MICHAEL SPAULDING\n\nPhillips brother, Alans son with Hope Bauer. Alan-Michael grew up in New York City and has always felt he was the outsider, the second-favorite son. Hes currently married to Lucy Cooper and residing in Europe.\n\nLUCY COOPER SPAULDING\n\nAlan-Michaels wife. Harleys half-sister.\n\nAMANDA SPAULDING\n\nOnce thought to be Phillips sister, Amanda is apparently his aunt, the daughter of Brandon Spaulding and Jennifer Richards.\n\nNICK MCHENRY\n\nLujacks previously unknown twin brother. Was married to Mindy Lewis. Now married to Susan and living in Europe.\n\nSUSAN MCHENRY\n\nNicks wife. Good friend to Lucy. HIV-positive.\n\nVICTORIA SPAULDING\n\nAlan and Alexs half-sister from Barbados.\n\nVICKY SPAULDING\n\nVictoria Spauldings daughter. Briefly lived in Springfield and dated David Grant.\n\nSHARINA\n\nBrandon Spauldings mistress in Barbados. Mother of Victoria Spaulding.\n\nGUS AITORO\n\nAlans illegitimate son with Phillips childhood nanny. Engaged to Phillip and Alan-Michaels ex-wife, Harley.\n\nHARLEY COOPER\n\nPhillips ex-wife. Mother of his son Phillip and Ricks son Jude. Was married to Alan-Michael. Engaged to Gus.\n\nLUCIA\n\nPhillips former nanny, then known as Regina. Mother of Alans son Gus.\n\nINDIA VON HALKEIN\n\nAlexandras stepdaughter. Lujack and Nicks stepsister. She blackmailed Phillip into marriage when she had evidence he was responsible for the explosion at Lujacks club. She later helped Phillip and Beth when Phillip was faking his death.\n\nERIC LUVONACZEK\n\nLujack and Nicks father, perhaps the one true love of Alexandras life. He sold one twin at birth for money (Nick) and took the other away from Alexandra at her father Brandons behalf (Lujack).\n\nSIMON HALL\n\nLujack and Nicks half-brother (Erics son) who tried to pass himself off as a missing Spaulding.\n\nLIZZIE SPAULDING\n\nPhillip and Beths daughter, born on Thanksgiving 1990 while Phillip was faking his death.\n\nALAN SPAULDING II, aka ZACH\n\nPhillips son with Harley Cooper, nicknamed after a character in Phillips novel."
