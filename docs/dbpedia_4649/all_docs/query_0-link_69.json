        "text": "Hi all I've started using the MTB commute bike totally on road now. The off road route is far to muddy and its not really appropriate me turning upto to work covered in mud. So I've decided to get some more appropriate tyres for the road but I have a few questions:\n\n1) Will there be much noticeable rolling resistance difference between say ~1.9 tyre and and 1.5\" tyre?\n\nMy wheels say they can take a minimum of 1,5\" but they are also tubeless ready and I think it might be easier to get the tyre to seal reliably if I go for something a bit wider. But as im coming from using big knobby tyres surely even a wide slick tyre will feel fast to me.\n\n2) From what I've read even a wide MTB slick tyre won't aquaplane at speeds I can do. So Is there any need to get anything with a tread or groove?\n\nIm quite liking the look of Schwalbe Kojak tyres but it seems these are fully slick. Will these be ok in the wet weather we're doomed for in the forseable future. Or will something even with a very simple groove help disperse the water better?\n\nthanks all for you wisdom ...\n\n0\n\nMy son uses the Hurricane (Schwalbe) and says they are the better ones for roads and wet.\n\nhttp://www.chainreactioncycles.com/Mode ... elID=36216\n\nI use these myself\n\nhttp://www.bikeoutlet.co.uk/products/Ma ... 37-44.html\n\n2) From what I've read even a wide MTB slick tyre won't aquaplane at speeds I can do. So Is there any need to get anything with a tread or groove?\n\nThen why have tread, I would hate to have to stop fast or tackle a bend in the wet without tread.\n\nPeds with ipods, natures little speed humps\n\nBanish unwanted fur - immac a squirrel\n\nhttp://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article ... heads.html\n\n0\n\nWhen I used to commute using a mountain bike I used Continental sport contacts all year round. You can pump them up to a fairly ridiculous pressure (got a track pump?) and they grip as well as anything else i've tried in the wet. Also, no, there's no need for any tread if you're using it solely on roads, a tread (IME) does nothing to help traction in the wet so you may as well use all the available tyre (a slick).\n\n- Genesis Equilibrium Athena\n\n- Cannondale CAADX Force/105/Rival\n\n0\n\nI commute 26 miles a day using my mountain bike, I'm currently using Continental Double Fighter II tyres.\n\nhttp://www.conti-tyres.co.uk/conticycle ... ter2.shtml\n\nI find them reasonably fast rolling but with a fair amount of grip (dry and wet). As they are what I'd consider semi-slicks they also don't complain too much if you do get forced off the road on to a more bumpy path.\n\nI went for them because at 1.9\" and with some tread they still look reasonably good on a mountain bike compared with a skinny slick tyre which i always think look strange nestled between the chunky fork posts.\n\nThe only problem I've had is that they are puncture prone, however, I bought some of that slime stuff off ebay for about Â£3 and have not had a problem since.\n\n0\n\nThanks for the links but those tyres are far too much off road orientated. I have two bikes, one is in normal MTB mode I will use for my off road kicks.\n\nThe other is also a MTB but will be fully used on the road for commuting to and form work, it will not even see a path-way so no need in the slightest for side knobs.\n\nIm also a bit confused about the grooves in road tyres. From what I've read, they won't aquaplane but still many road tyres have grooves? Im Just after peoples real life experiences with full slicks on wet roads.\n\nIm more after this kinda thing:\n\nhttp://www.bikeradar.com/gear/category/components/tyres/product/kojak-tyre-8877\n\n0\n\nThey have grooves because people are idiots and it is far easier to make a tyre with some tread to shut them up than try and educate them :roll: It also makes it easier to differentiate between otherwise very similar tyres in your range...\n\nGo for a big slick as they're very very very fun to ride, something like a tioga k-rad (file tread is pretty much slick) skinny slicks drop the centre of gravity noticeably and kill the enjoyment of the ride.\n\n0\n\nso the grooves are just a marketing thing? and I will be fine getting a tyre that is fully slick? cool thanks ride_whenever.\n\nI did a search for \"tioga k-rad\" and it didn't lead any where. I found a Kenda K-rad but that is a street/bmx tyre and doesn't come in 26 inch. I also found a Tioga City Slick.\n\nI still think the Kojak is top of my list and or the Continental tyre I linked above. Although I can only find them with a wire bead. Its been a while since I had a wire bead tyre are these things still really annoying to get on and off and is it going to work with a UST rim?\n\n0\n\nSport Contacts are about the slickest things out there. As for tread on road tyres, i'm not really sure why so many \"road\" tyres have tread, I can only assume it's because they are really hybrid tyres in disguise. I've never used nobbly mtb tyres in anger on roads so can't really help with how they compare. You have to be a bit careful on smooth surfaces with all tyres but as long as you're sensible slicks will grip just as much or more than tyres with a tread even in the wet.\n\n- Genesis Equilibrium Athena\n\n- Cannondale CAADX Force/105/Rival\n\n0\n\nvery interesting, I always assumed the grooves increased grip in the wet by channelling the water. I'll have to read the article on aquaplanning.\n\nI only have one bike these days, in the week I use the semi slicks and on the weekend swap the tyres over for off road riding. In the spring I was thinking about getting some 26x1.95 Kenda Kwick Roller Sports.\n\nhttp://www.kendauk.com/kwick.html#\n\nDoes anyone have experience in these tyres, I've always liked their off road tyres.\n\n0\n\nI use scwable city jets 26x1.5s, great budget tyre (Â£10 each each )\n\nI had to stick the original tyre back on the bike last week due to wearing out the tyre over a good period of time and boy was it harder work to keep the same speed !!\n\nSlicks for roads are a lot easier to pedal, your not going to aqua plane and unless your riding on mud/snow then knobblies will not make it a better ride.\n\nOn ice it has been shown that slicks offer better grip as you have more rubber on the road,of course if you hit ice at the wrong angle any tyre will slip whether it has tread or not.\n\nFCN 3/5/9\n\n0\n\nI've used the 1.5 City Jets for about 1000 miles now and they're showing signs of wear but I've not had a puncture yet. I reckon I've got another 1000 in them if I needed it but I'm likely to change within the next 500 anyway. They've been great, can't complain at all.\n\nFCN 2 to 8\n\n0\n\njeremyrundle wrote:\n\nWell if slicks are your way forward in winter with rain, leaves on road, grit, salt etc, wear a good helmet.\n\nSummer would be better.\n\nClearly coming from a forum keyboard hero who has never ridden on slick tyres through a winter then!\n\nWhy people feel able to comment on something they know nothing about is beyond me.....and I know you know nothing about it as you tell us you would never do it, therefore you've never tried it!\n\nSimon\n\nCurrently riding a Whyte T130C, X0 drivetrain, Magura Trail brakes converted to mixed wheel size (homebuilt wheels) with 140mm Fox 34 Rhythm and RP23 suspension. 12.2Kg.\n\n0\n\nThe Beginner wrote:\n\njeremyrundle wrote:\n\nWell if slicks are your way forward in winter with rain, leaves on road, grit, salt etc, wear a good helmet.\n\nSummer would be better.\n\nClearly coming from a forum keyboard hero who has never ridden on slick tyres through a winter then!\n\nWhy people feel able to comment on something they know nothing about is beyond me.....and I know you know nothing about it as you tell us you would never do it, therefore you've never tried it!\n\nSimon\n\nActually I have, in fact and have through MY choice chosen not to, so in winter I prefer to be cautious, obviously a case of \"assuming\" I have not done something without knowing me personally.
