        "text": "Introduction\n\nI discovered this past week that there is such a thing as the Burpee Test. The PAX in St. Louis call it an official MABA beatdown. If you want to know what it is, google it or show up tomorrow at the LP. No Coupons needed. HC in the thread. 3 days left for MABA, LFG! Also heard a rumor that our attendance for the month of January may be trending lighter than December but that canâ€™t be right. Make sure you get out and get some!\n\nThe Scene: In the teens, minimal wind. Paths were mostly clear of ice. Good time to get to work!\n\nWelcome & Disclaimer\n\nF3 is:\n\nFree\n\nOpen to ALL men,\n\nPeer led in a rotating fashion\n\nHeld outdoors rain or shine, heat or cold.\n\nEnds in a Circle of Trust\n\nI am not a professional. You are here of your own free will. I have no knowledge of any injuries or fitness considerations. It is your responsibility to be safe and modify exercises as needed. Maintain 15 feet between you and the next guy at all times. In cadence (IC) is the rhythm in between each rep or the body movement between each rep."
