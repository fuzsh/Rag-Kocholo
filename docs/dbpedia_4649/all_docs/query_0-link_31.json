        "text": "Good afternoon,\n\nQuick introduction first of all:\n\nVictarion, 34 years old (35 in few days, that’s why I am here ). I am living and working in Luxembourg in the financial sector. Not very original I noticed yes.\n\nSince couples of months I am taking the train to go to my office and I discovered that I can pretty much cut my commute time by half comparing to the bus.\n\nBasically instead of taking 50min-1h15 from my door to the office with the bus (with crowd, headaches due to diesel vibrations, the frequent stops and high correlation to bus driver skills…). But I can do 35-45min using the train and an additional commuting vehicle to cover the remaining 4km between home and train station (<2km) + from train station to work (<2km). In other words I have more time to see my wife and my two years boy.\n\nI am currently using an old electric scooter like this: https://www.google.com/search?q=electric+scooter+mach+1&client=opera&hs=a10&source=lnms&tbm=isch&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwiS2c-0ufdAhVsK8AKHeT_DhQQ_AUIDigB&biw=2520&bih=1330#imgrc=oJxPUxMstkhLqM\n\nThat is very quick engine (30-35kmh max on flat road) and a lot of fun but it is very bulky and heavy (+/- 30kg so difficult to carry when hoping on the train) and it is not appropriate for winter as well as rainy spring/falls which tends to be frequent in this part of the world . Although we had a fantastic September month here.\n\nI am sure that you see the question coming…\n\n1 - I thought first of all of a simple bicycle. But I don’t want to mess up my pants with grease and dirt.\n\n2 - Then I thought about a belt driven bicycle for cleanliness and single speed bike for simplicity (as my riding area include flat roads in good/very good condition only) and to keep the cost low. But since it has to be carried on I want it very light. And it seems that single speed are a big thing now so the combination of these three factors seems incompatible with my budget (±500€). I was unable to find second hand models that fit my criterias. In addition, it will prevent me to take the bus should the train won’t work: snow, ice, strike, who knows!\n\n3 - Then I thought about folding bike but It is the same problem. Good quality, light and belt driven folding bike seem to be like unicorn. In addition the traditional H foldings mechanism doesn’t seems very practical to carry, fold/unfold quickly and in a clean way.\n\n4 - And then come the Strida : Seems perfect for the train and even the bus due to lower foot print, easy to fold and unfold without messing around with dirty pedals and chains and I can find some model (second hand LT, Second hand SX and even second hand MAS special edition with 2 speeds) that fit my budget, and that I can carry easily/very easily… Last but not least I am in love with nice pieces of engineering, so here I am.\n\nSo my question is : let’s assume that you have a possibility to buy any of the three above models for the same price (of course if price are the same then the higher-end models are older but there are all in good functioning conditions) which is the one you would go for ?\n\nI already know that :\n\nLT is the lightest/easiest to carry once folded and with plastic wheels seems to be even more maintenance free and seems rather average+/good quality.\n\nSX will be the faster and more stable with 18 inches wheels during the rides.\n\nMAS will be a mix bag (16’’ only but with 2 speeds) but a higher complexity (any quality issues about Schlumpf 2 speeds ?).\n\nPS : I want to mention that I don’t plan to use the bike on heavy rain/icy/snowy conditions. I have acknowledge the issue related belt skip caused by dirt accumulation and the plastic free wheel wearing out problem.\n\nMany thanks in advance and best regards,\n\nVictarion.\n\nHello Victarion,\n\nmany thanks for the nice introduction and welcome at Strida forum\n\nThere is no maintenance free folding available on this planet - that was bad marketing by Ming themselves if I remember correctly…however, nowadays they say:\n\nThat doesn’t really mean maintenance free…\n\nJust two things make the LT series cheaper than the other Strida bikes - the plastic wheels and the plastic (bottom bracket) excenter. Main part of the price reduction are in fact the wheels…hmmm, well, let me say that is vindicated indeed.\n\nhttp://www.ats-speeddrive.com/tpl/all_sd_tc.html\n\nCaution please; original Strida MAS were never produced with original Schlumpf drives.\n\nMing cycle used drives from ATS, a Taiwanese company which has the license to reproduce the Schlumpf drives.\n\nBoth drives are just looking pretty similar - in fact you’ll notice that they are different once you start disassembling them. One could say the ATS is one of the first Schlumpf versions, contrary to ATS was the Schlumpf drive developed further over the years.\n\nhttp://www.schlumpf.ch/hp/antriebe/antriebe_engl.htm\n\nI’m insisting on the difference because I’ve never heard of failing Schlumpf drives - but I did from ATS drives (even more than that - I’ve received a defective one and refurbished it myself.)\n\nSo, I’d go for an SX first and check if there is demand for a second gear.\n\nInstalling a new ATS kit (or maybe consider the three speed efneo drive?) can be done later and seems less risky than to buy a second hand ATS drive.\n\nKind regards,\n\nChris\n\nHello,\n\nMany thanks for your prompt reply guys. I was not expecting this so fast.\n\nNope. From home to train station it is flat. From Train station to work, it is very hilly (Luxembourg is an old fortress) but there nice elevator with panoramic view & funiculaire to join the city center for free. And there are bike friendly.\n\nEVO isn’t for me considering the price. I can’t afford a new LT so…\n\nYes you are right. My point was to say something like “something less to care about” meaning spokes tension. I have already read all your intervention where you had continuously pointed that there is no such thing as a maintenance free bike. In addition I would that there is no such thing as a maintenance free thing. My bad.\n\nSo both of you agree for the SX.\n\nWell, I was not very tempted by this one because I’ve read several time here that the Strida was developed in 16’’ wheels in mind and they have adapted 18’’ later. So things can eventually not work not as intended. At the same time, potential issues with 18’’ wheels might be probably nothing to fix compared to issues that can arise from a worn ATS. SO both of you have very logic approach.\n\nIf anyone of you (or other readers) sell or know someone that is selling a SX in good condition around +/-500€, please do let me know.\n\nThanks and regards,\n\nVictarion.\n\nWell here, situation is different. For the moment at least.\n\nLike a friend used to say :“they’ve switched directly from the tractor to the BMW”.\n\nBicycles never have been a point of attention here. Not that there is no bicycle lanes. They’ve covered the whole country with bicycle lanes and when not available the roads are always in smooth/very smooth conditions.\n\nBut people are fed up about traffic jam. Really fed up. That’s insane. Not very surprising given the amount of person (and I am polite) that takes the last Audi & BMW leased by their companies to cover <5km. And the worst is that they are f@@@@@g alone in their vehicles !!! So people are really fed up because even the buses are stucked in the traffic. The consequence is that you see more and more people riding to work. Skaters, electric skateboards, bicycle, electric bicycle, solowheels… It is everywhere. Politicians do they best to push people to go for public transport and “soft mobility”. They made a tramway, built a funiculaire, elevators, autonomous mini-buses. It is ineviatble. They will have to regulate. Not even talking about the real estate that is sky-rocketting and pushing people to the surroundings. Regulation and strict framework will come here very soon.\n\nIn the meantime I can still enjoy passing by riders with my electric scooters and riding it a freeking snowboard until I can’t (I remove the seat so I ride in standing position). Not convenient to hop in the train but what a joy when I hit the road.\n\nAnyway, we are off topic. My strida will be shipped tomorrow. That’s the most important no ?\n\nHi Victarion - I am excited for you on the Strida purchase. Of all the bikes I own this is one unique bike for me.\n\nCorrect.\n\nFor me when I purchased my Strida EVO’s I got the frame clip with it. I was silly and didn’t know what it was and threw it away as the local Strida distributor “crosses” their Stridas as well! I would NOT be surprised if you get the frame clip with your Strida so wait and see. If you do not - just buy one. Alternatively like me, who threw it away and then bought a new one - only to MIS-place it… what I do not is fold it and simple NOT criss-cross the frames to an X-shape. I leave mine loosely folded on the Strida bicycle stand.\n\nJust use the current one till it is worn out or you are having issues. A free wheel when new should have really high tall distinct teeth. When worn it gets smooth on the edges and the size of the teeth reduces (from the wear). I actually purchased extra freewheels - 2 x plastics and 3 x metal. Honestly I think this free-wheel is over-hyped. I ran my original free-wheel for atleast 5,000km before it had any signs of wear. (metal one!), I am now approaching 14,000km and I am still on 2nd free wheel.\n\nJust to compare my Strida EVO to my 8-speed chain bike. I wore out the 8-speed chainwheel in 3.5 months and had to replace it. My Strida EVO has been with me for almost 2 years with one free wheel replacement.\n\nLike all bikes, you should carry either a bicycle tube patch kit (to patch punctures on the roadside, or carry 2 tubes (ideally) and a small hand pump. The beauty of the Strida is you wont need to take the wheel off to repair a puncture - and if you do it’s so easy as it’s only attached to one side of the fork of the bike (not 2 sides like regular bikes). If you new to bikes, you should learn how to repair punctures in the event you are far away from a local bike shop.\n\nCheck out this guy on youtube and his 16\" Strida - he changes his tube with bare hands\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OV8rr4OI9hg\n\nThere are ONLY two 18\" tyres you can choose from:\n\nKojak: stridacanada.ca/product/schwalbe-kojak-tires/\n\nInnova: stridacanada.ca/product/strida- … inch-tire/\n\nThe Kojaks are the high pressure slicks (110PSI if I recall - need to check my bike). They cost 2x the price of the Innova and has a better ride IMO. As it’s a slick tyre (no treads) - take care when riding in the wet. The Innova is better for wet weather, is fatter and softer (at 85 PSI)\n\nYou need a HEX key set to take the wheels off, etc (not that you need to!). But off memory this comes with a Strida hidden under the seat.\n\nstridacanada.ca/product/strida-allan-key/\n\nI never adjusted my spokes. They just sit there on my wheels…\n\nGet use to the ride - it can be twitchy at first but you get used it quite fast. I honestly believe it’s one of the LOWEST maintenance bikes there is since I own 5 bikes. Because it has no chain - there is no chain cleaning and lubing, no deraileur cleaning, no cassette cleaning, if you ride in the wet I wipe it down in < 2 mins ready to store / fold. I not had ANY flats using both the Kojaks or Innova’s in the 14,000km but that comes down to the road etc and luck sometimes! (I have had flats on my other bikes - so could be luck). I ride up to 70KM in one cycle outing … NO PROBLEMS. It’s the MOST comfortable bike to ride compared to my road bikes etc… because it’s up-right “Dutch seating” and the Kelvar belt makes it effortless. Disclaimer - the one speed may see you top out on a max speed and spin. I have the Strida EVO (3 gears) and it keeps me going to some degree. But however as you have the SX which is single speed - it’s even LESS maintenance or items going wrong because you do not have the KS3 gear box.\n\nIf I owned an Strida SX… I would see myself atleast 5 years of good ownership (I owned my forst Strida EVO now for almost 2 years and I ride the crap out of it!) with minimum maintenance except wear and tear items such as :\n\nfree wheel replacement (hard to say - probably 4000-7000km mark??\n\ntyres (they last for ages as you wont be skidding on those tyres and burning the rubber compound\n\ntubes if you get punctures…\n\nadjust handbrakes every now and then… and replace brake pads once in a blue moon.\n\nnot sure what “type of bike” owner you may be… what I mean by this is I tend to wipe my bike down every ride (1-2 min job) of mud etc as I keep the bike indoors. I seen other owners ride in muck, wheels caked in mud etc and they NEVER clean. You may want to simply wipe down and keep the “Free wheel” clean of muck and dirt. Pebbles etc will wear out the free wheel. I am not saying hose it and clean it - just make sure there is no caked mud, pebbles etc… for me I rarely even wipe that as the flanges of the free wheel prevent most of the gunk even getting in. But I do read strange stories of free wheels wearing out in < 2000 km on this forum which is beyond me…\n\nOn the part of maintenance…if you took this Strida SX to the bike shop for the full service THEY ONLY will:\n\ntighten nuts/bolts, lube a few points to look busy(?)\n\ncheck tension of kelvar belt (this lasts for ages !)\n\ncheck brakes - replace as needed or adjust\n\nI think that is it. There is no gear shifting, derailment or chain adjustments etc. It’s a very simple bike.\n\nTHAT IS IT! It’s the lowest maintenance bike I own.\n\nHi Victarion,\n\nyes, a frame clip is actually a good idea.\n\nJust I think it is more the rear hinge which benefits and less the belt.\n\nIn fact is the rear hinge the Achilles heel of your Strida - and sometimes even the real cause of belt issues.\n\nOn the SX shown above there is already an aluminium freewheel mounted.\n\nThe signs of wear on the freewheels teeth can be seen easily - is there still a narrow rectangle visible on top of each tooth or is it just a line, moreover that one can see a more or less pronounced corner at one tooth side.\n\nThe signs, without using a sharp eye, are:\n\nBelt gets loose\n\nJumping, Skipping\n\nTwisting (often combined with rear hinge play)\n\nTorn\n\nTubes/tyres:\n\nYou may have noticed already that this is an enourmous advantage on your Strida; compared to most of the other folding bike brands - nothing more easy than to change tubes or tyres\n\nSure, as long as it is not a burden for you I’d recommend a spare tube anyway.\n\nI had the feeling in the past that Schwalbe tubes combined with Sclaverand valves are the best choice if you don’t want to pump air each few days.\n\nYes right, there are just the original Innova tyres, Schwalbe Kojak and another slick, the Strozzapreti of Joseph Kuosac.\n\nTubes are btw interchangeable between Innova and Kojak - but not Strozzapreti.\n\nCounterquestion:\n\nDo you want to ride in rain or on sand or cobblestones?\n\nFor the spokes you need a spoke wrench of your choize in size 3,2 mm plus a piece of wood (that can be a stolen old cook spoon of Mom or even a piece of branch) - and your ears\n\nJust knock on each spoke after another (separate; for example first the inner and then the outer).\n\nDo you hear a clear tone (ignore the tone height)?\n\nYes → That spoke should be Ok.\n\nDo you hear a dull noise?\n\nYes - > That one is loose.\n\nBy today I’ve got perhaps 8 or 10 original wheels in hands - usually there are between 1 and 3 spokes per wheel loose. But I think that’s better the newer the wheels are - maybe you find not a single one loose\n\nCheers,\n\nChris"
