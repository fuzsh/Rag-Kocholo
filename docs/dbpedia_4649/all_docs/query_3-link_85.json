        "text": "There are unique events, and I want to be a part of them. Tuvan throat singers and traditional instruments meet electronica….ahhh yes please!!! I have loved listening to and sharing Huun Huur Tu‘s music on air for years now and when I found out about the project they had going on with the multi-talented Carmen Rizzo, I just knew it would do me right. The album “Eternal” easily takes the listener on the journey to and through a mystical place to so many, and sometimes with the workmanship of Carmen, you can even find places yet known, the ones you go to when you are deep in. The show at the beautiful Stoughton Opera House transformed a room in a landscape, took sounds and united a front where all good things meet, and best of all assisted in opening some new eyes to the cross-pollination of what people call genres (borders). The first set was mainly Huun Huur Tu‘s time to be acoustic, with tales behind the songs shared, each moment pulled an audience closer to the artists homeland. The ability to create such sound from one’s throat and keep it harmonious within the music while plucking and striking or blowing into traditional Tuvan instruments is a sight I can not describe in words, as the sound created such a mask. In the second set, Carmen added to what Huun Huur Tu started with light beats, heartbeats…giving another life to this already incredibly living sound creature, keyboards and devices fed this being and seemed to pump the blood, not only onstage, but the house seemed to take on a new persona. It is always fascinating to watch people see things for the first time. I want to thank both the fellas in Huun Huur Tu and Mr. Carmen Rizzo for seeing beyond musical borders & boundaries and making a new paint to add to the tapestry.\n\nI am so glad I made it out to see Rickie Lee as she made her way back to Madison after a 4 or 5 year hiatus from our fair city. She was radiant in her magical musical ways, transforming the Barrymore Theater into a blast from the past, almost a 1970’s “feelin’ it for the first time” as she attempted to (successfully I believe) go chronologically through her albums and send her voice, words and tunes into that space place a nice sized crowd filled. The stage murmurs as she talks to or around the crowd would make even the exact same show as unique as the artist herself is, and to be in her world for just that few hour period really did make for a time travel experience. While there were many highlights of this night, there was none finer for me then watching Rickie Lee Jones hit the drum kit for a great rendition of Traffic’s ‘Low Spark of High Heeled Boys’ off here 2000 release “It’s Like This”, which she nailed down as her own with her deep lyrical twists and the turns of her bandmates caused this tune to really stand out. The show is still a show and the legend that Rickie Lee Jones has become is just starting to be truly defined and no better way to have your two cents heard then to go see her live and find out for yourself.\n\nOn certain Tuesdays at the Frequency here in Madison, there is a “BLUES TUESDAY” event that has been building itself quite a solid reputation, and this week it was friend of the show Seth Walker who was in town to show off his Americana Blues sound, his Willie Nelson impersonation and his fantastic ability to craft songs that make you want to listen. Seth writes songs that people have felt before, but the way he puts himself into is vocally makes the song still an unknown that you want to get to know better…..In our recent interview it was easy to tell that Seth Walker loves music, he was raised by parents who were trained classically and was playing the cello by four. I ‘ll let him tell you the rest of the story, hell..I bet he can sing it to you. He played a lot of things off his new album “Leap of Faith” and easily had captured the crowds feet, as the place got a good stomp-a-going….and sometimes even on rhythm. This venue allows all in attendance, (did I mention what a nice big crowd was there?) to feel like the artist is right in your living room, and I think Seth was feeling right at home with us and something tells me we’ll get a chance to see our old pal Seth Walker back here sometime in the near future….and if you happen to see that he is playing out where you can get to, take a chance and go feel good, be a part of that night’s story.\n\nColoradoâ€™s new state-of-the-art entertainment facility will celebrate its Grand Opening on March 5 and 6 with a two-night stand by Furthur featuring Phil Lesh and Bob Weir. Scalable for audience capacities from 3500 to 6500, the Center fills a niche as the stateâ€™s premier mid-sized venue, and will change the way patrons currently think about a venue of this size. No matter the occasion for visiting, 1STBANK Centerâ€™s first priority is the patron experience. Morris explains, â€œ1STBANK Center promises to offer all of what we love most about music and entertainment: quality, creativity, community and fun.â€ improvements that promise to mark 1STBANK Center as the newest addition to an already impressive list of landmark Colorado music venues, such as Red Rocks Amphitheatre, The Paramount Theatre, and the Fox Theatre. Gone are the white walls, bright lights, and soul-less signage of the typical modern arena. Patrons of the 1STBANK Center will enjoy rich colors, creative textures, and artful touches throughout the venue. At the center of the entertainment experience is a state-of-the-art video screen that hangs over the stage. Measuring 130 feet across, this versatile feature offers limitless ways to transform the venueâ€™s main space. Spaces throughout the concourse have also been transformed. The upper lounge, open to all guests, is now a premier viewing area with direct sight lines to the stage. Additionally, several previously enclosed bars have been remodeled to be inviting and welcoming gathering spots.\n\nGrand Opening weekend show details are as follows:\n\n1STBANK Center Grand Opening\n\nFurthur featuring Phil Lesh and Bob Weir\n\nFriday, March 5 (8pm) Limited number of tickets still available\n\nSaturday, March 6 (8pm) SOLD OUT\n\n(doors open at 6:30pm both nights)\n\nI always am pleased to have artists share their own words as part of the program….especially when they are coming to are near MadTOWN. This week was no exception, heading to town on Tuesday at the Frequency is Seth Walker, redefining American roots and country roll music and then I had the pleasure of having an eye opening chat with sound artist extraordinaire Carmen Rizzo who will be at the Stoughton Opera House this coming Saturday, with Huun Huur Tu. I was honored to call both men friends of the show and look forward to catching each event live, to sooth my being(s). here’s what the sets around the conversations looked like:\n\nDub Je Je- Antibalas\n\nZinabu- Bunzu Sounds\n\nGadget Funk- the Herbaliser\n\nPower to the People- Black Eyed Peas\n\nMetropolis- Particle\n\n———————-\n\n1968- Bill Frisell\n\nPug- Furley\n\nGettin’ it Together- Tommy Guerrero\n\nMo Lovin’- Chris Joss\n\nShine- LiftOff\n\n———————-\n\nFfeh- Ed Alstrom\n\nDon’t do it- Salvador Santana\n\nAll day Sucker- Stevie Wonder\n\n———————-\n\nIn the Dark- Seth Walker\n\n**On air Chat with Seth Walker**\n\nI Don’t Dance- Seth Walker\n\n———————-\n\nLily Blossom- MarsMobil\n\nOtherwise- Morcheeba (live)\n\nCloud Cover-Tierra Negra & Muriel Anderson w/Victor Wooten\n\nDr. Nick- Project Trio\n\nCorrupt- Tigran Hamasyan\n\nMeboli- Balkan Beat Box\n\n———————–\n\nAncestor’s Call- Huun Huur Tu & Carmen Rizzo\n\n**On air Conversation with Carmen Rizzo**\n\nTuvan Prayer- Huun Huur Tu & Carmen Rizzo\n\nIn Search of a Lost Past- Huun Huur Tu & Carmen Rizzo\n\nDid another early bird fill in this morning from 7-9am.

The person said talks had been going on for several months but a buyer had not yet been found. A spokesman for EMI refused to comment on the sale bid, which could raise tens of millions of dollars for the struggling label. Some analysts say the sale price would be far short of the $165 million EMI needs to survive, and would mean giving up one of its most high-profile assets â€“ not just a recording studio, but a tourist attraction and shrine for Beatles fans. EMI, whose artists include Coldplay, Lily Allen & Robbie Williams, has struggled financially since it was bought in 2007 for 2.4 billion pounds by private equity firm Terra Firma Capital Partners. EMI has fared worse than the other major labels â€“ Universal, Sony BMG and Warner Music Group â€“ amid the decline of CD sales and the rise of digital music downloading. Several big-name acts, including Radiohead and the Rolling Stones, quit the label amid the cutbacks & restructuring that followed the takeover. EMI’s predecessor bought the Georgian town house at 3 Abbey Road in London’s residential St. John’s Wood neighborhood for 100,000 pounds in 1929 and turned it into one of the world’s most sophisticated recording studios. Edward Elgar recorded “Land of Hope and Glory” with the London Symphony Orchestra there in the 1930s. It is still used by orchestras; the soundtracks of the “Harry Potter” and “Lord of the Rings” films were recorded at Abbey Road. Since the 1960s it has been one of the world’s most famous rock music studios. Albums recorded there include Pink Floyd’s “Dark Side of the Moon,” Wings’ “Band on the Run” and Radiohead’s “OK Computer.” Most familiar to some is the crosswalk in front of the studio which was immortalized on the cover of 1969’s “Abbey Road,” the final studio album The Beatles recorded. “Let it Be” was the band’s final release, in 1970, but it was recorded before “Abbey Road.” Paul McCartney still lives nearby.\n\nPotential buyers beware, however: the famous black-and-white crossing is not included in the deal.\n\nfOURPLAY has had the distinct privilege of enjoying the past 12 years of its 20 year history with legendary guitarist Larry Carlton. As Larry takes his leave to delve further into his solo career, the band extends their heartfelt gratitude for his contributions and wishes him continued success in all his pursuits. Larry will remain an integral part of our musical family & legacy.\n\nfOURPLAY now welcomes its newest member, multi-faceted virtuoso guitarist, Chuck Loeb. His musical contributions will undoubtedly enhance the creativity and pursuit of excellence fOURPLAY has enjoyed in the studio and on the stage.\n\nfOURPLAY thanks its many loyal fans and promises that this latest incarnation will inspire the band to explore new avenues of creativity while maintaining its core musical values. (I know I am looking forward to this new endeavor)\n\n-from our friends in fOURPLAY!\n\nToday I got the chance to cross something off the list of things i have never done before..a little Roller Derby. Here in Madison we have this fantastic league….The action was super and the personalities were believable, with a play by play over the speaker system it made for a humorous way to spend an afternoon. Here a few photos from the event.\n\nThanks to my friends at WORT FM for this first time flat track experience.\n\nThe brand new release from Nneka off of the Decon Record label, this album is making a way into my heart via my ears pretty quickly. From the “tell it like it is” vocals that trap rap into a hip hopped up reggae dub dance-a-holic rhythm that speaks to my mind/soul/feet. Nneka has an album here that plays well in a club mix, a world music set or a funky transition track that’ll change the gears of a music program that temps the ears of people with spirits….people that dream to hear the sounds that have never encompassed them before…Concrete Jungle shows love for the listener while sharing with us some uncomfortable truths…challenges our minds vs our hearts through the very rhythms and beats of Africa and all the sounds that have come from her sands.\n\nWith Ed Alstrom on the Hammond. After one listen through, I have come to one conclusion thusfar, HOTT!! And now after several listens and some radio airplay, this album is easily a mainstay in my programming as it enters and exits sets of all kinds of music with a fluidity that isn’t easy to find. The album is very backyard on a summer’s day playful and downright groovin’ at times that you cannot help but shake the very things shakeable and sometimes breakable. There are many moods to the album within the grooves…Starting off with melodies rich in reflection and guitar licks (Charlie Jones) hotter than a Bar-B-Q pit, drum beats (Don Guinta) like a sidewinder snakes heartbeat~ and there are some highly ORGANic dashes that are equal parts soul refreshing and body moving and at times making the blues feel a little happy…..For me they style of “Booganova” is something I have loved for so long but never knew the word that went with he sound, in many moments on this album I am reminded that the reason I like musicians like Ed Alstrom is that they keep on re-defining the sounds I recognize pieces of, and turn them into a whole new thang. I believe this album has the power to do that for more people than me.\n\nDid a 7-9amCST Fill in today just to get some extra time as next week I will not be on air. So here is what I put together for the earlier morning hours:\n\nRocket Baby- Johnnie Mustang\n\nla Gitane- Duane Andrews\n\nBenny’s Tune- Lionel Loueke\n\nMamang- Kristo Numpuby\n\n——————\n\nTwisto Mambo- the Sort of Quartet\n\nWalter L-Burton/Methany/Swallow/Sanchez (live)\n\nShine on you Crazy Diamond-Viktor Krauss w/Shawn Colvin\n\nAlways Near- Narayan & Janet\n\n——————\n\nFull Throttle- 9th Wave\n\nI Ain’t Human- Leroy Powell & the Messengers\n\nSopchoppy- Swamp Cabbage\n\nSomething Fast- Seth Walker\n\nThat’s What Keeps me Rockin’-the Robert Cray Band\n\n——————-\n\nParalyzed- Gang of Four\n\nFaced you in a Neon Light- Yordan Orchestra\n\nGolden Retriever- Super Furry Animals\n\nGood Old Days(wash away)-Darren Gaines & the Key Party\n\nFame- David Bowie (live)\n\nAtomic Heels- Secret Machines\n\nI Kid you not- Spain Colored Ornage\n\n——————-\n\nCircumstances- Soulhound\n\nWhen she Whispers your Name- Buck 69\n\nLet me Roll it->Foxey Lady-Paul McCartney (live)\n\nWhite Rabbit- Patti Smith\n\nMile High- Morphine\n\nAround the World- Delaney Davidson\n\nTremendous Dynamite- Eels\n\nYou’re so Fine- John Hammond\n\nYou’ll be Mine- John Hammond\n\n———————\n\nWaiting for a Miracle- Jerry Garcia Band (live)"
