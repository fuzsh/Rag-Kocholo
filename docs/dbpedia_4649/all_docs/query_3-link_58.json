        "text": "Anthony D. DiNozzo Movie References\n\nTony DiNozzo often makes comparisons between the cases he's working on and situations he and the team find themselves in with movies or TV shows. From something as little as a single quote to a detailed plot, DiNozzo has seen them all and will quote them no matter how inappropriate or frustrating for his coworkers.
