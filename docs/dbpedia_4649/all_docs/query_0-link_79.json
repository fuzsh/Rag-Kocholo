        "text": "This was the era when I first started going out to see live shows, so I remember it fondly. In my neck of the woods, the big bands and albums from the period were 311 (Blue Album/Transistor), Sublime (self-titled) and Smashing Pumpkins (Mellon Collie and the Infinite Sadness). No Doubt was also catching on at the time. I saw them headline for 311 in 1995 and soon after they were headlining shows of their own. As others have stated, the band Live was very big then with their song \"Lightning Crashes\" and Throwing Copper album.\n\nGreen Day and Weezer, two of the biggest new bands of 1994, were falling off a bit in terms of popularity by 1996. Pinkerton in general didn't sell well, although now obviously everybody considers it a classic. Green Day would rebound with that awful \"Time of Your Life\" song later in the decade.\n\nSomewhat forgotten bands like Everclear, Marcy Playground, Seven Mary Three, Tripping Daisy and Eve 6 all had big hits on alternative radio. None of these bands seemed to possess even a fraction of the staying power of the first generation of nineties bands though, and so new releases by Soundgarden, Pearl Jam, Alice in Chains, Stone Temple Pilots and the Chili Peppers continued to dominate the airwaves.\n\nBritpop was making some waves, but didn't really translate to radio in the States. A few songs did go on to become massive hits though, such as \"Wonderwall\" and \"Song 2\".\n\nIndustrial was still quite a big thing at the time, and I remember seeing shows by KMFDM, Skinny Puppy, My Life with the Thrill Kill Kult, the Lords of Acid and Course of Empire. All of these groups are worth investigating. The biggest by far was Nine Inch Nails who were riding high with The Downward Spiral and \"Closer\".\n\nThe ska revival to me seemed like more of a fad, and I really remember it only lasting about a year or so from '96-'97. Groups like Less Than Jake and the Bosstones came out of that scene, but most of the people I knew back then who were heavily into ska quickly moved on to other things as the scene changed. There also was an even shorter lived swing revival at the time that smacked of record labels trying to cash in on whatever was next. It died a quick and merciful death.\n\nIn rap and hip-hop I remember Snoop Dogg's Doggystyle and Cyprus Hill's Black Sunday being incredibly popular. Wu-Tang's Enter the 36 Chambers came out in November of '93, and they kept on getting bigger and bigger throughout this era. Nas also came out with Illmatic right on Wu-Tang's heels.\n\nRap-rock was becoming a thing, with Rage Against the Machine being possibly the biggest break-out band during the time you're asking about. I also can't forget about the Beastie Boys-- they were *huge* back then, and Beck was another big up and comer with ties to hip-hop.\n\nWhat's now called EDM, but back then was just called \"Techno\", got off the ground with big releases by the Chemical Brothers, Prodigy and Fatboy Slim.\n\nThe jam band scene was in good shape with Phish and Dave Matthews Band leading the charge. Dave Matthews actually got quite a bit of airplay on MTV and terrestrial radio. This led to the rapid rise (and even faster downfall) of Hootie & The Blowfish, Counting Crowes and others.\n\nAs mentioned, this was the age of the Lillith Fair, and folky girl singers were all the rage for a bit. However all of them combined could not compete with Alanis Morrisette when it came to sales. Jagged Little Pill was a juggernaut that just kept selling and selling.\n\nMainstream rock seemed to be dying a quick death once alternative rock started infiltrating AOR and MTV. Traditional rock was considered old hat, and only megastars of the old guard like Van Halen, Aerosmith and Tom Petty continued to produce hits.\n\nOver in the indie scene, I remember Liz Phair's Exile in Guyville and the Flaming Lips' Transmissions from the Satellite Heart making a lot of noise at the time. Pavement was also coming on strong, but they were another one of those bands like the Pixies that would have to wait until they broke up to experience a massive resurgence.\n\nI remember the Top 40 around this time being mostly crap, with a lot of one hit wonders like Los Del Rio and the Quad City DJs. Every once in awhile a good song would surface though. I seem to recall liking some of Aaliyah's and Ace of Base's songs from that era."
