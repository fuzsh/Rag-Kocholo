        "text": "The Thang\n\nThang One 11’s ! On the Hill!!\n\nNice and simple, we started with 10 Swing and Squats, followed by a run up the hill with a merkin at the top, subtract one swing and squat and add one merkin until you’re doing one swing and squat and 10 merkins then hold squat for the 6.\n\nThang Two More Swings and Running! and Overhead Press !!\n\nRepeating sets of 10, 15, 20 and 25 Swings with sets of the same reps of an alternate exercise between each set of swings and a run between the paths on either side of the hill after the 25 swings. We did some OHP, some goblet squats, and generally had an awesome time.\n\nThen we took the kettlebells for a walk — they like that — and circled back up at the flags for some Mary which included:\n\nTik Toks\n\nCopperhead big-boy situps\n\nCircle of Trust\n\nThank you for joining me today on my birthday for something a little different. Life is full of uncertainty and surprises, and by getting up and getting out in the gloom we hopefully make ourselves a little more ready to face those uncertainties and surprises that life may bring us and turn life’s hardships into grace. The world needs alot more of that right now, so thank you for taking the time with me to get a little bit better for those whom you will serve today, your M’s your shorties and your colleagues.\n\nNaked Man Moleskin\n\nI belatedly realized that I hadn’t grabbed a b-day Q spot, and was glad to see a Tuesday at Two-Wolves was open. I’ve only been out to this AO a couple times, but I knew it would be a good group of pax, and I was pretty sure the hill would be a good mix with some kettlebell fun.\n\nBig thanks to Bean Counter for providing some tunes, and having my 6!"
