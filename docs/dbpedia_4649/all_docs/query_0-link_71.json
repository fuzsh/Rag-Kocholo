        "text": "Note that riding in the wet is generally more risky than riding in the dry since things are indeed slipperier than in the dry. Relatively innocuous things in the dry become hazardous in the wet regardless of your tire type (such as wet leaves). Wet also is accompanied by oil in many cases on the road, especially if rain hasn't washed the oil from the cars off the road yet. Stopping distance goes up, etc.\n\nMany racing bikes tend to have sensitive and twitchy steering/geometries, so they aren't great in the wet since they are not easy to control to begin with (even in the dry). But this is a function of the bike itself, not the tires primarily. Note that some control of speed and riding style will help here (riding like a racer means taking risks like a racer).\n\nHere is a summary of a recent article by Leonard Zinn in VeloNews on the subject (with responses from major tire manufacturers) and Sheldon Brown's advice:\n\n1) You can't hydroplane (bicycle tires are too thin and high pressure for this).\n\n2) Slick is best in the dry.\n\n3) Tread is effectively aesthetic on road tires (Specialized argues for a tread pattern of < 0.2 mm, but the pattern doesn't matter according to them, Challenge argues for a particular pattern, Continental says they are effectively aesthetic, Vittoria wants you to have tread [ but remember, they all want to sell you a new tire! ]). The road is rough providing the grip.\n\n4) Things that matter: Softness of the tire/compound, reduced tire pressure, higher tire width, rider weight to get a nice big contact patch.\n\nI ride daily on whatever tyres are fitted to my bike. Rather than worrying whether it's a slick or not your should worry how hard the tyre is especially in the wet. A knackered old (age wise not wear wise) tyre that hasn't been used for ages will be rock had and won't work well in the wet. Some tyres are just a lot softer rubber than others when new.\n\nI've driven racing cars on slicks, race karts on slicks and race bikes on 'slicks' if you can ever call a bike tyre a slick. The main difference with a wet race car tyre is the compound and obviously they have grooves to stop aquaplaning at high speed. At low speed, if you take a wet line, it's the soft compound giving you the grip, not so much the water displacement from the tread.\n\nWhat it really comes down to is how happy you are with letting the bike slide around under you and that takes years of experience to learn this. If you can't handle a slide you're likely to find out in the wet. Read on... If you have tyres with hard low grip rubber the bike slides at lower speeds. Softer grippier compounds will make the speed it slides at higher. Obvious right? However there is another factor that isn't as binary as this. It's how easy a tyre is to handle when it's approaching this limit. This is what is really important about a wet tyre. If you have another rider alongside you and you're racing him on different tyres you may find out that one tyre type has more grip than the other as he corners faster on that particular road surface. Without another bike doing exactly the same thing you won't really be able to say one tyre is grippier than the other particularly in the wet as if one tyre handles better you'll think it has more grip.\n\nHere is what it comes down to. The better wet tyre is one which has a greater slip angle before the limit is reached and the coefficient of friction starts decreasing. In the wet there is a dramatic change in grip after you go over the limit. The better tyre is one which has less of a step change as the limit is reached. A soft structure will allow the carcass of the tyre to warp increasingly so up until all of the tyre is sliding and the limit is reached. At low side loads the trailing edge of the tyre contact patch slides and this moves progressively forward as the load increases to the point where the whole contact patch is sliding and the tyre cannot provide any more grip. This is maximum slip angle when no part of the contact patch is not slipping. It is how you feel the tyre reaching the limit. If the tyre is soft you'll feel the slip angle at a lower load and you will be able to keep pushing the tyre with some confidence it wont go over the edge. If the carcass is rock hard you'll not notice the tyre slipping until the bike disappears from under you.\n\nSo anyway to summarise. Slick vs tread is a red herring. It's about how soft the compound is and how much the carcass can flex. You'll find any bike tyre handles better in the wet if you drastically lower the pressures. Although in the dry the same thing applies a soft tyre will be completely unresponsive and will feel awful with low pressures. Also if it's too soft the contact patch may start working against itself and provide forces in different directions because it's folding over which reduces grip. Some tyres work better than others but it is not about the tread pattern unless you're doing over 100mph or something! And by the way his is all before we start worrying about vibration and bump damping... there is a lot more to it than just slick = bad/tread = good."
