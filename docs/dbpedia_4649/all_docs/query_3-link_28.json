        "text": "Amazon Fire Troubleshooting Your Amazon Fire TV Device\n\nArticle / Updated 11-24-2021\n\nNo device is completely infallible. This article explains ten of the most common problems related to Fire TV software and hardware, and shows you how to solve every one of them. Fire TV devices, such as the Fire TV Stick, Fire TV Stick 4K, and Fire TV Cube, are extremely simple, spartan even, when viewed from the outside. Theyâre devoid of moving parts; the Fire TV Stick and Fire TV Stick 4K have but a single port for the power supply and the Fire TV Cube has just a few ports in the back. But donât let that Zen-inducing outer shell fool you â inside every Fire TV device is a complex and sophisticated array of electronics. The good news is that these intricate innards enable Fire TV to perform its streaming magic. The bad news is that, when it comes to electronic devices, âcomplex and sophisticatedâ almost always leads to some kind of trouble. Thatâs just a fact of modern life, although it doesnât guarantee that your Fire TV device will one day bite the digital dust. In fact, thatâs very unlikely because Fire TV devices are known to be remarkably robust and nearly error-free. Did you notice that hedge-word nearly in that last sentence? Alas, yes, sometimes even Fire TV devices behave strangely. Troubleshooting general problems Before getting to the specific problems and their solutions, I want to take you through a few very basic troubleshooting steps. Many problems, particularly problems related to your Fire TV device, can be solved by doing the following three things (each of which I explain in more detail in the sections that follow): Restart your Fire TV device. Update your Fire TV deviceâs system software. Reset your Fire TV device to its factory default settings. Try restarting your Fire TV device to see if it solves your problem. If not, move on to updating the software and see if that helps. If thereâs still no joy, only then should you try resetting your Fire TV device to its factory default settings. Restarting your Fire TV device If your Fire TV is having trouble playing media, connecting to Wi-Fi, pairing with a Bluetooth device, or doing any of its normal duties, by far the most common solution is to shut down the device and then restart it. By rebooting the device, you reload the system, which is often enough to solve many problems. There are three ways to restart either a TV that has a Fire TV device attached or a Fire TV Edition Smart TV: If you still have access to the Fire TV interface, choose Settings, choose either My Fire TV (for Fire TV Stick or Fire TV Cube) or Device & Software (for Fire TV Edition), and then choose Restart. On the Fire TV remote, press and hold both the Select button and the Play button for about five seconds until Fire TV restarts. For a Fire TV device or a Fire TV Edition Smart TV, unplug the deviceâs power cord, and then plug it back in. You may be tempted to just plug the Fire TV device back in again right away, but hold on a second. The Fire TV device has internal electronic components that take some time to completely discharge. To ensure you get a proper restart, wait at least three seconds before reconnecting your Fire TVâs power supply. Checking your Fire TV device for software updates Your Fire TV device uses internal software â called Fire OS (OS is short for operating system) â to perform all sorts of tasks, including connecting to your Wi-Fi network, handling media playback, and saving your settings. If your Fire TV is acting weird, and restarting the device doesnât help, you can often un-weird the device by updating Fire OS. Sometimes installing a new version of the operating system is all you need to make your problem go away. In other cases, updating the system may fix a software glitch that was causing your problem. Here are the steps to follow to check for and install Fire OS updates: Choose Settings. Choose either My Fire TV (for Fire TV Stick or Fire TV Cube) or Device & Software (for Fire TV Edition). Choose About. Choose Check for Updates. When you highlight the Check for Updates command, the right side of the screen shows the current version of Fire OS, as well as the last date Fire TV checked for updates. Fire TV checks to see if an updated version of Fire OS is available. If an update is waiting, Fire TV downloads the update and then displays the Install Update command. Fire TV installs this update automatically the next time it determines that youâre not using your TV. If youâd rather install the update right away, choose Install Update. Fire TV installs the update. During this process, leave your device on and donât press any buttons on the remote. Resetting your Fire TV device If your problem is particularly ornery, restarting or updating the device wonât solve it. In that case, you need to take the relatively drastic step of resetting your Fire TV device. I describe this step as âdrasticâ because it means you have to go through the setup process all over again, so only head down this road if restarting and updating your device donât solve the problem. How you perform the reset depends on your device: Fire TV Stick or Fire TV Cube: Choose SettingsâMy Fire TVâReset to Factory Defaults. Fire TV Edition: Choose SettingsâDevice & SoftwareâReset to Factory Defaults. You canât connect to your Wi-Fi network Wireless networking adds a whole new set of potential snags to your troubleshooting chores because of problems such as interference and device ranges. Hereâs a list of a few troubleshooting items that you should check to solve any wireless connectivity problems youâre having with your Fire TV device: Restart your devices. Reset your hardware by performing the following tasks, in order: Turn off your modem. Turn off your Wi-Fi router. After a few seconds, turn the modem back on and wait until the modem reconnects to the Internet, which may take a few minutes. Turn on your Wi-Fi router. Many Wi-Fi devices these days are all-in-one gadgets that combine both a Wi-Fi router and a modem for Internet access. If thatâs what you have, instead of performing steps 1 through 4, you can just turn off the Wi-Fi device, wait a bit, turn the device back on, and then wait for the device to connect to your Internet service provider (ISP). Restart Fire TV. Look for interference. Devices such as baby monitors and cordless phones that use the 2.4 GHz radio frequency (RF) band can wreak havoc with wireless signals. Try either moving or turning off such devices if theyâre near your Fire TV device or Wi-Fi device. Keep your Fire TV device and Wi-Fi router well away from microwave ovens, which can jam wireless signals. Many wireless routers enable you to set up a separate Wi-Fi network on the 5 GHz RF band, which isnât used by most household gadgets, so it has less interference. Check your router manual to see if it supports 5 GHz networks. Check your password. Make sure youâre using the correct password to access your Wi-Fi network. Check your range. Your Fire TV device may be too far away from the Wi-Fi router. You usually canât get much farther than about 230 feet away from most modern Wi-Fi devices before the signal begins to degrade (that range drops to about 115 feet for older Wi-Fi devices). Either move the Fire TV device closer to the Wi-Fi router or, if it has one, turn on the routerâs range booster. You could also install a wireless range extender. Update the wireless router firmware. The wireless router firmware is the internal program that the router uses to perform its various chores. Wireless router manufacturers frequently update their firmware to fix bugs, so you should see if an updated version of the firmware is available. See your device documentation to find out how this works. Update and optionally reset your Fire TV device. Make sure your Fire TV device is up to date and, if you still canât connect to Wi-Fi, reset your Fire TV device. Reset the Wi-Fi device. As a last resort, reset the Wi-Fi router to its default factory settings (see the device documentation to find out how to do this). Note that if you do this, you need to set up your network again from scratch. Youâre having trouble streaming media Streaming media on Fire TV works well most of the time, but problems can arise, particularly the following: The media never starts. The media takes a long time to start. The media plays intermittently. The media stops playing and never resumes. Itâs maddening, for sure, but most of the time you can fix the problem. I say âmost of the timeâ because there are a couple of situations where media streaming just doesnât work well: When you have a slow internet connection speed: Media files are usually quite large, so for these files to play properly you need a reasonably fast Internet connection. Amazon recommends at least a half a megabit per second (0.5 Mbps), but realistically you should probably have a connection that offers at least 8 Mbps download speeds for HD content. When you have an intermittent internet connection: If you live in an area with spotty internet service, that now-you-see-it-now-you-donât Internet connection makes streaming media impossible. What if you have a zippy internet connection and strong service all the time? First, congratulations! Second, there are a few things you can try to get media streaming to work better (or at all). Try these troubleshooting ideas in the following order: Restart your Wi-Fi router and Fire TV device using the steps I outline in the preceding section. If you have other devices accessing your Wi-Fi network, shut down any devices youâre not using. Move your Fire TV device closer to your Wi-Fi router. Your Fire TV device must be within 230 feet of the router (115 feet for older routers), but the closer the two devices, the stronger the Wi-Fi signal. Make sure your Wi-Fi router isnât situated near devices that can cause interference, such as microwave ovens and baby monitors. Make sure your Fire TV device isnât close to a wall or a metal object. If your Fire TV device is sitting on a low shelf or even on the floor, move it to a higher location. If your Fire TV device is inside a cabinet or similar enclosure, take it out. If youâre having streaming problems with a particular app, run through the following steps to clear the appâs application data: An appâs data includes your app account info and any settings youâve configured for the app. If you clear the appâs data, it means you have to enter your login info all over again and reconfigure your settings, so be sure you want to perform this operation before proceeding. On your Fire TV device, choose SettingsâApplicationsâManage Installed Applications. Choose the app youâre having trouble with. Shut down the app by choosing the Force Stop command. Clear the appâs data by choosing Clear DataâClear Data command. The Fire TV mobile app canât pair with your Fire TV device After you have your Fire TV device set up, the Fire TV mobile app will automatically locate and pair with the device. This enables you to use the app as a remote control for the Fire TV device (and, if you have Fire TV Recast, it also enables you to use the app to watch and record over-the-air TV programs). Itâs all very convenient, but that convenience goes out the window if the Fire TV mobile app canât locate or pair with your Fire TV device. If that happens, optionally curse your rotten luck and then try these troubleshooting techniques: Make sure your Fire TV device and the device thatâs running the Fire TV mobile app are connected to the same network. Check to see if another device on your network is currently mirroring the display of your Fire TV device. If your Fire TV device is currently being mirrored, the Fire TV mobile app wonât be able to pair with the Fire TV device, so you need to first stop the mirroring. Restart Fire TV. Restart the device on which the Fire TV mobile app is installed. Disconnect a Bluetooth device or Fire TV remote (including any device running the Fire TV mobile app) from your Fire TV device. Fire TV supports up to seven connected devices, so if youâre already at that limit, your Fire TV mobile app wonât be able to pair with the Fire TV device. (Advanced) Log in to your wireless router and search the advanced settings for Multicast support. If you see an option for toggling Multicast, make sure that setting is On. (See your wireless router manual to learn how to log in and access the routerâs settings.) (Advanced) Log in to your wireless router and check to see if a static IP address has been assigned to your Fire TV device. If so, configure the router to assign an address to the Fire TV device automatically. (Again, see your router manual to learn how to work with IP addresses.) Your Fire TV screen is blank If your Fire TV Edition Smart TV or the TV to which youâve connected your Fire TV device shows a blank screen, here are a few things to check out: Make sure the TV is plugged in and turned on. Make sure the TV is set to the correct input: For a TV with a Fire TV device attached, switch to whatever input the Fire TV device is connected to. For a Fire TV Edition Smart TV, make sure the TV is using the Fire TV input (press the Home button on the Fire TV remote to display the Fire TV Home screen). For a Fire TV device connected to the TV via HDMI, disconnect and then reconnect the device. If your Fire TV device is connected to your TV with an HDMI cable or HDMI hub, try replacing the cable and/or the hub. On the Fire TV remote, press and hold both the Up button on the navigation ring and the Rewind button for about ten seconds. Fire TV begins running through the available resolutions for the TV and displays each resolution for ten seconds. If you see the text for a particular resolution, choose Use Current Resolution. If you have a second-generation Fire TV Cube (which supports 4K), make sure youâre using a high-speed HDMI cable. You donât hear audio during playback If the video portion of a stream appears just fine, but you donât hear the audio portion, then some troubleshooting is in order. Here are a few techniques to run through: Check that the TV audio isnât either muted or set extremely low. If your TV is connected to a receiver or similar audio output device, make sure the device is turned on and correctly connected to your TV. If youâre playing sound through your TVâs speaker, make sure the speakers are turned on in the TVâs settings. For a Fire TV Edition Smart TV, choose SettingsâDisplay & SoundsâSound Settings, and then set the TV Speakers setting to On. For a Fire TV device connected to the TV via HDMI, disconnect and then reconnect the device. If your Fire TV device is connected to your TV with an HDMI cable or HDMI hub, try replacing the cable and/or the hub. For a Fire TV Stick or Cube, try turning off Dolby Digital Plus Output. Choose SettingsâDisplay & SoundsâAudioâDolby Digital Output, and then choose Dolby Digital Plus Off. Youâre having trouble connecting a Bluetooth device Fire TV devices support a wireless technology called Bluetooth, which enables you to make wireless connections to other Bluetooth-friendly devices, such as headsets, speakers, and smartphones. This section provides you with a few common Bluetooth troubleshooting techniques. You donât see a Bluetooth device Not surprisingly, you canât make a Bluetooth connection if you canât see the device on the Fire TV deviceâs Add Bluetooth Devices screen (which you display by choosing SettingsâRemotes & Bluetooth DevicesâOther Bluetooth DevicesâAdd Bluetooth Devices). If you donât see a Bluetooth device, try the following: Make sure the device is turned on and fully charged. Make sure the device is discoverable. Most Bluetooth devices have a switch you can turn on or a button you can press to make them discoverable. Make sure the Bluetooth device is well within 33 feet of your Fire TV device, because thatâs the maximum range for most Bluetooth devices. (Some so-called Class 1 Bluetooth devices have a maximum range ten times as long.) If possible, reboot the Bluetooth device. If you canât reboot the device, or the reboot doesnât solve the problem, restart your Fire TV device. Check with the Bluetooth device manufacturer to ensure the device is capable of being paired with Fire TV devices. Specifically, you need to find out whether the device supports either of the following Bluetooth profiles: Advanced Audio Distribution Profile (A2DP) Audio/Video Remote Control Profile (AVRCP) You canât pair with a Bluetooth device As a security precaution, many Bluetooth devices need to be paired with another device before the connection is established. You initiate the pairing by tapping the device on the Fire TV deviceâs Add Bluetooth Devices screen (choose SettingsâRemotes & Bluetooth DevicesâOther Bluetooth DevicesâAdd Bluetooth Devices). In some cases, the pairing is accomplished by entering a multidigit passkey â sometimes called a PIN â that you must enter. Fire TV devices donât support Bluetooth PINs, so if your device requires a PIN, youâre out of luck. Otherwise, you may find that even though the device shows up fine on the Add Bluetooth Devices screen, you canât pair it with your Fire TV device. First, try the solutions in the previous section. If none of those steps does the job, check to see if the Bluetooth device is already paired with another device. Bluetooth stuff can only pair with one device at a time, so before you can pair the device with Fire TV, you need to disconnect the device from its current pairing. If you still canât get the pairing to work, tell Fire TV to start over by forgetting what it knows about the device: On your Fire TV device, choose SettingsâRemotes & Bluetooth DevicesâOther Bluetooth Devices. Highlight the Bluetooth device name. Press the Menu button. Fire TV asks you to confirm the unpairing. Press Select. Fire TV removes the device from the Other Bluetooth Devices screen. Choose Add Bluetooth Devices. Press the switch or button that makes the device discoverable. When the device reappears on the Add Bluetooth Devices screen, highlight the device and then press Select to pair with it again. Your Fire TV device is unresponsive Perhaps the most teeth-gnashingly frustrating problem you can encounter in technology is when a device â particularly one you paid good money for â just stops working. The device appears to be on, but tapping it, shoving it, gesticulating at it, and yelling at it are all ineffective at making the device respond. If that happens to your Fire TV device, try the following troubleshooting steps, in order: Wait a few minutes. Sometimes devices just freeze up temporarily and then right themselves after a short break. Check your Wi-Fi network to make sure itâs working properly and that your device is connected. Restart the device. Check to see if your device is using the most up-to-date system software. Reset your device. You changed your Wi-Fi network password Your Fire TV device needs access to your Internet-connected Wi-Fi network to do its thing. When you first set up your Fire TV device, getting the device on your network by entering your network password is one of the first chores. That usually works flawlessly, but what happens if down the road you change your network password? In that case, you need to reconnect to your network by following these steps: Choose SettingsâNetwork. You see a list of available networks, with your network at the top of the list. Highlight your network. On the Fire TV remote, press Menu to run the Forget This Network command. Fire TV asks you to confirm that you want to forget the network. Press the Select button on the remote. The Fire TV device disconnects from the network and returns you to the list of available networks. Choose your network. Enter your new network password and then choose Connect. Fire TV reconnects you to your network. A Fire TV app doesnât work properly If a Fire TV app wonât start, freezes, or runs erratically, here are some troubleshooting suggestions you can try to resolve the problem: Restart Fire TV. Force the app to quit by choosing SettingsâApplicationsâManage Installed ApplicationsâForce Stop. Clear the appâs cache (an area of memory that the app uses to store oft-used data) by choosing SettingsâApplicationsâManage Installed ApplicationsâClear Cache. Clear the appâs data by choosing SettingsâApplicationsâManage Installed ApplicationsâClear Data. Uninstall the app by choosing SettingsâApplicationsâManage Installed ApplicationsâUninstall, and then reinstall the app.\n\nView Article\n\nAmazon Fire Amazon Fire TV DevicesâStreaming Media\n\nArticle / Updated 03-06-2020\n\nElectronics such as Amazonâs Fire TV devices â the Fire TV Stick, Fire Stick 4K, and Fire TV Cube â are streaming media devices. Explore the two-sides-of-the-same-coin ideas of streaming media and streaming media devices, which are at the core of the Fire TV experience. Do you really need to know this background to use Fire TV? Will having a working definition of streaming benefit you when youâre binge-watching Fleabag? Well, okay, the honest answer is âNoâ on both counts. Or, I should say, the answer is âNoâ if you donât care about getting the most out of your Fire TV investment, youâre not the least bit curious how this technology works, or youâre 100 percent certain that youâll never have problems with Fire TV. Introducing streaming If you were around for the early days of the web â Iâm talking about the mid to late 1990s â then you probably remember when the web pages of that era, which contained mostly text with a few images, started giving way to pages that contained media â music, TV shows, and even short movies. That was a fun development, but no one would have described it as âon-demandâ entertainment because it could take anywhere from a few minutes to an hour or more for the media you clicked to download to your computer. Crucially, you had to wait until the entire media file was downloaded before you could start the playback. Inevitably, with Murphyâs Law (âAnything that can go wrong will go wrongâ) in full effect back then (as it is today), the longer you had to wait for a media file to download, the more likely it was that the download would crash when it was 99 percent complete. The molasses-in-January pace and the donât-breathe-until-itâs-done fragility of media downloads were facts of online life back then, but a few nerds started thinking there had to be a better way. They realized that for most people, however slow their download speed, it was still faster than the rate at which they listened to or watched whatever media was being downloaded. Why was this speed difference important? Because it meant that after at least some of the media was downloaded, it could start playing from the beginning and the rest of the download could continue in the background without fear that the user would âcatch upâ to the download and be forced to wait. This breakthrough meant that most media would start playing within a few seconds. It also meant that, usually, the media was never really âdownloadedâ to the userâs computer; instead, when the media started playing, it would continue to play until it was over or the user moved on to something else. Consuming media online became like sitting on the bank of a stream watching the water flow by, so some sensitive poet of an engineer coined the term streaming to describe this new way of listening to and viewing media. Nowadays, streaming has gone, well, mainstream for a couple of reasons. First, many users now have computers and/or mobile devices that are powerful enough to process even the largest and most complex incoming audio and video signals. Second, lots of people (at least in the developed world) have speedy Internet connections and home networks, which means that streams usually start within a few seconds and the streaming buffer â the area of memory thatâs used to store the next few seconds or minutes of the media (more on this a bit later) â is always full, which results in a continuous and glitch-free playback. Streaming today usually comes in one of the following forms: Audio streaming: Mostly prerecorded music through services such as Amazon Music and Spotify, as well as podcasts through services such as myTuner Radio and Plex. Video streaming: Mostly prerecorded TV shows and movies through services such as Amazon Prime Video and Netflix. Live streaming: As-itâs-happening audio or video, such as on-the-air TV programs delivered by your cable provider or Fire TV Recast, live concerts or sporting events, Internet-based audio or video phone calls, or video feeds of a specific place or scene. Streaming media devices Imagine yourself sitting on the bank of a fast-running stream. Your eyes see the water whooshing by; your ears hear the babbling of the brook; your nose smells the wonderful scent of clean water; if you feel like it, you could also use your hands or feet to sense the coolness of the stream and your tongue to taste the freshness of pure water. In much the same way that your senses give you âaccessâ to a stream, you need a special device to âaccessâ an online media stream. Sometimes that device is just a piece of software. For example, when you click to play a YouTube video, the YouTube site streams that video using special playback software that runs right in your web browser. Increasingly these days, however, that device is a piece of hardware called a streaming media device, and it offers two main features: Streaming service interface: A method for discovering and interacting with services that offer audio, video, or live streams. This feature is incredibly useful because there are dozens â nay, hundreds â of streaming services out there, so having a way to bring all your favorite services together in a single interface is mind-blowingly convenient. Streaming media playback: The capability of playing, pausing, rewinding, and fast-forwarding an incoming media stream, usually by pressing buttons on a remote control that comes with the streaming media device. Amazon gadgets such as the Fire TV Stick, Fire TV Stick 4K, and Fire TV Cube are streaming media devices that use your TV or a mobile device to display a streaming service interface and play audio, video, and live streams, which you can control using either the bundled remote or Alexa voice commands. How streaming works As you might imagine, streaming media is a hideously complex bit of business that requires extremely sophisticated hardware and software to make everything work as well as it does. The good news is that you donât need to know anything about that complexity, so you can shut off all those alarm bells going off in your head. Instead, this section provides you with a very basic overview of how streaming performs its magic. Streaming is a five-step process For prerecorded audio or video, the media file is stored on the web using a special computer called a web server. When a user requests the media, the server begins sending the first few seconds of the audio or video file to the user. When the data reaches the userâs network, the networkâs wireless router passes the data along to the streaming media device. Note that the router is usually wireless, but it doesnât have to be. The streaming media device waits until it has a certain amount of the media before it starts the playback. The saved data is stored in a special memory location called a buffer. When the buffer contains enough data to ensure a smooth playback, the stream is sent to the userâs TV or mobile device, and the entertainment begins. More about buffering The buffering process that occurs in steps 4 and 5 of the previous section is such a crucial part of streaming that it goes on throughout the playback, not just at the beginning. For example, when you examine the current progress of the playback, you usually see a progress bar. The circle shows your current position in the playback. Just ahead of the circle is a dark portion of the progress bar, which shows you how much of the upcoming stream is stored in the buffer; the rest of the progress bar is white, which tells you that part of the stream hasnât yet been received by the streaming media device. (The colors may vary on your TV or mobile device.) Why not just play the media as it arrives and skip the buffer altogether? That would be nice, and it just might work in an ideal world, but the world we actually inhabit is far from ideal. In real life, media streams can suffer from a number of problems: The server may be slow to respond if it has to deal with a large number of media requests. Your Internet connection speed may be slow. Your network speed may be slow. Glitches between the server and your network may mean that large parts of the media stream are delayed or missing. Any one of these problems could cause the stream playback to be interrupted for anything from a split second to a few seconds. Without a buffer to fall back on, your show or song would have to stop mid-playback to wait for the delay to resolve itself. However, with anywhere from a few to a few dozen seconds stored in the buffer, the streaming media device can keep the stream playing, and you remain blissfully unaware of any problems because they happen in the background, without affecting your enjoyment of the media. Streaming and data usage When youâre looking to sign up for an account with an Internet service provider (ISP), youâre usually presented with several plans of varying prices. One of the features that varies with the price of each plan is the amount of data per month that you can transfer between the Internet and your modem. This is called usage or monthly usage, and the cheaper the plan, the lower the usage limit you get per month. That limit is important because if you go over that amount in a given month, the ISP will charge you a small fortune for each gigabyte (GB) that you exceed your cap. Overage fees can easily run to several dollars per gigabyte, and Internet forums are awash in tales of people getting dinged $100 or $200 for going way over their monthly allowance. So, yes, for all but the most well-heeled, this is big bucks Iâm talking about here. Itâs important to know early in your streaming career that streaming media is very data-intensive, meaning it requires tons of usage. For example, here are the data usage values for some popular music streaming services: Music Service Data Usage per Hour Amazon Music 0.11GB Apple Music 0.11GB Google Play Music 0.14GB Pandora 0.57GB Spotify 0.14GB Similarly, here are the data usage values for various types of video stream qualities (most video streaming services give you the option of streaming video in two or more of these values): Video Quality Data Usage per Hour Low 0.3GB Standard Definition (SD) 0.7 GB High Definition (HD) 1.0GB to 3GB 4K Ultra-High Definition (UHD) 7GB Based on these usage values, you can see that it wouldnât be that hard to use anywhere from 5GB to 10GB of streaming media a day. That translates to 150GB to 300GB a month, which is bad news, indeed, if your ISPâs monthly usage cap is 100GB! My advice? Get an unlimited Internet plan if you can afford it. If thatâs too pricey for your budget, then keep an eagle eye on your daily usage (most ISPs offer a tool that lets you view your daily usage). If you see that things are getting out of hand, usage-wise, dial back the streaming for a few days or a week to make sure you donât go over your cap. What you need to stream: apps and hardware What you need to get into the world of streaming varies widely depending on a number of factors, including what streams you want to check out, your budget, your tolerance for complexity, and your desire for convenience. At the simplest end of the streaming world, all you need is an Internet connection and a web browser. In this bare-bones scenario, you surf to a streaming site (such as Netflix, Spotify, or YouTube), sign into your account (if the site requires an account, as most do), and then use the siteâs interface to find and play the streams you want. Many streaming sites offer free accounts (supported by the ads youâre forced to view), so you can get into streaming without forking over any extra cash. Jumping around from one streaming website to another isnât hard, but it tends to get cumbersome as your stable of streaming services gets larger (as it inevitably will). One easy way to get around the inconvenience of multiple websites is to use the apps that most streaming services provide. Install the app on your smartphone or tablet, use the app to sign in to your account on the streaming service, and â voilÃ ! â you can now locate, curate, and watch streaming media on your mobile device! Viewing streaming media on a mobile device might seem like the perfect solution for an age obsessed with its smartphones and tablets. Thereâs also something wonderfully intimate about watching a TV show or movie on a mobile device. That said, scratching the streaming itch using only mobile device apps does have its downsides: You may end up with apps scattered across multiple devices. If youâre not connected to Wi-Fi, overindulging your mobile streaming media habit may put you over your cellular planâs monthly usage cap. You may prefer to watch a particular show on a large TV screen. Itâs hard for multiple people to watch a stream on a relatively small mobile screen. There are ways to send a mobile deviceâs video stream to a TV (this is called mirroring), but an easier way to solve all these problems is to throw more hardware at them. I speak, in particular, of a streaming media device, which is designed to take an incoming stream and display it on a connected TV screen (or mobile device). Even better, all streaming media devices come with a large collection of apps for streaming services. This means that you can collect all your streaming apps in one location and view each appâs streaming content on whatever TVs and mobile devices youâve connected to the streaming media device. Itâs a pretty sweet setup, and itâs the Fire TV way of doing things.\n\nView Article\n\nAmazon Fire How to Set Up Fire TV Edition\n\nArticle / Updated 02-28-2020\n\nYour Fire TV Edition comes with an Alexa Voice Remote that you use to navigate the Fire TV interface (either by pressing buttons or by using voice commands). Before proceeding with the Fire TV Edition configuration, remove the back cover of the Alexa Voice Remote, insert the two batteries that came with Fire TV Edition, and then reattach the back cover. If your Fire TV Edition comes via a device other than a Smart TV (such as a soundbar), connect the device to your existing TVâs HDMI port, which on most TVs is labeled HDMI. If your TV has multiple HDMI ports (as most modern TVs do), then the ports are usually labeled HDMI 1, HDMI 2, and so on. When you power up the Fire TV Edition Smart TV for the first time, or when you switch to the Fire TV Edition input if youâre using a device such as a soundbar, Fire TV Edition takes you through the following setup procedure: 1. Use the Alexa Voice Remote to choose the language you want to use. You use the Alexa Voice Remote to âchooseâ something by using the navigation ring to press Down (the bottom part of the ring), Up (the top part of the ring), Left (the left part of the ring), or Right (the right part of the ring) to highlight the item you want; then press Select (the circular area in the middle of the navigation ring). The TV should automatically pair with the Alexa Voice Remote. If nothing happens when you press the Alexa Voice Remoteâs buttons, you can force the Alexa Voice Remote into pairing mode by pressing and holding the Home button for ten seconds, or until you see the Alexa Voice Remoteâs LED rapidly flashing amber. 2. Choose Continue. After a short delay, Fire TV Edition displays a list of available Wi-Fi networks. 3. Choose your Wi-Fi network. Fire TV Edition prompts you to enter the network password. 4. Use the Alexa Voice Remoteâs navigation ring to enter each character in your network password, and then choose Connect. If your network password requires one or more uppercase letters, you can switch to uppercase characters by choosing the aA button or by pressing Menu on the Alexa Voice Remote. Fire TV Edition connects to your network and then checks to see if there is an available update to Fire OS, the operating system that runs Fire TV Edition. If an update is available, Fire TV Edition downloads and installs the software, which can take a few minutes. Note that Fire TV Edition may restart during this process. Eventually, Fire TV Edition asks which Fire TV experience you want to have. 5. Choose Full to get the most out of Fire TV. Fire TV Edition asks you to sign in to your Amazon account. 6. Choose I Already Have an Amazon Account. Fire TV Edition displays the Enter Your Amazon Login ID screen. What if you donât have an Amazon account? No problem. Choose I Am New to Amazon, and then use the Create Account screen to set up your account. 7. In the Email Address field, use the Alexa Voice Remoteâs navigation ring to type your Amazon accountâs email address, and then choose Next. Fire TV Edition displays the Enter Your Amazon Account Password screen. 8. In the Password field, use the Alexa Voice Remoteâs navigation ring to type your Amazon accountâs password, and then choose Sign In. By default, Fire TV Edition hides the password by displaying each character as a dot. If you want to make sure you entered the password correctly, choose the Show Password button. If youâve enabled two-factor authentication on your Amazon account, Fire TV Edition will prompt you to enter a code to verify the sign-in. Type the code that was sent to you, and then choose the Next button. Fire TV Edition confirms your Amazon credentials, signs in to your account, and then registers your Fire TV Edition device. Getting to Know the Alexa Voice Remote One of the most important doodads that comes with your Fire TV device is the Alexa Voice Remote, which enables you to control Fire TV in two ways: Manually: Press the remoteâs buttons to navigate the Fire TV interface and control playback. By voice: Use the remoteâs built-in Alexa voice assistant to issue verbal instructions for navigating the interface and controlling content. Touring the Fire TV Alexa Voice Remote The Alexa Voice Remote will be your constant companion while you use Fire TV, so it pays to take a couple of minutes now to learn the lay of the remote land. First, the figure shows the version of the Alexa Voice Remote that ships with devices such as Fire TV Stick, Fire TV Stick 4K, and Fire TV Cube. Hereâs a summary of what you see on the face of the Alexa Voice Remote: Power: Press this button to turn your TV on and off. Microphone: The internal device that picks up your voice requests when you press and hold the Voice button. LED: Lights up when the Alexa Voice Remote is performing certain operations, such as signaling the remoteâs readiness to be paired with a Fire TV device. Voice: Press and hold this button to make a voice request. Navigation ring: Use this ring to navigate the Fire TV interface. Select: Press this button to choose the item thatâs currently highlighted on the Fire TV screen. Back: Press this button to go back to the previous Fire TV screen. Home: Press this button to jump directly to the Fire TV Home screen. Menu: Press this button to see a menu of commands that are specific to the item thatâs currently highlighted on the Fire TV screen. Rewind: During playback, use this button to rewind the content as follows: Press the button once to rewind by ten seconds. Press and hold the button for a few seconds, and then release the button to continuously rewind at low speed. While rewinding at low speed, press the button again to continuously rewind at medium speed. While rewinding at medium speed, press the button again to continuously rewind at high speed. While rewinding at high speed, press the button again to switch to the low-speed rewind. To stop rewinding, press the Play/Pause button. Play/Pause: During playback, press this button to pause the content; press the button again to restart the content. Fast Forward: During playback, use this button to fast-forward the content as follows: Press the button once to fast-forward by ten seconds. Press and hold the button for a few seconds, and then release the button to continuously fast-forward at low speed. While fast-forwarding at low speed, press the button again to continuously fast-forward at medium speed. While fast-forwarding at medium speed, press the button again to continuously fast-forward at high speed. While fast-forwarding at high speed, press the button again to switch to the low-speed fast-forward. To stop fast-forwarding, press the Play/Pause button. Volume Up: During playback, press this button to raise the volume; press and hold this button to raise the volume quickly. Volume Down: During playback, press this button to decrease the volume; press and hold this button to decrease the volume quickly. Mute: During playback, press this button to toggle the volume off and on. Touring the Fire TV Edition Alexa Voice Remote If youâre doing the Fire TV thing using a Fire TV Edition Smart TV or Fire TV Edition Soundbar, then you get a slightly different configuration for the Alexa Voice Remote, as shown in Figure 4-2. This configuration has the same buttons as the Fire TV Alexa Voice Remote shown in Figure 4-1, but it also comes with the following extra buttons: Guide: Press this button to display the live TV channel guide. Hot buttons: These four buttons take you directly to the app for whatever streaming service is named on the button. For example, pressing the Netflix button opens the Netflix app. As a bonus, pressing one of the hot buttons also turns on your TV if itâs currently off. If youâre accessing Fire TV Edition in a country other than the United States, your Alexa Voice Remote will likely offer one or more hot buttons that are different from the ones shown here.\n\nView Article\n\nAmazon Fire How to Set Up Fire TV Cube\n\nArticle / Updated 02-28-2020\n\nIf you have a Fire TV Cube, you need to position the device optimally, connect the device to your TV, and then trudge through the setup procedure. The following discussion explains all. How to position your Fire TV Cube After youâve liberated your Fire TV Cube from its packaging, one obvious question arises: Where the heck do you put it? Somewhere near your TV seems like the obvious answer, but choosing the best location is a bit more complicated than that. Here are some things to consider: Your Fire TV Cube requires full-time power, so make sure thereâs an outlet close enough to the device. Your Fire TV Cube connects to an HDMI port on your TV, so it needs to be close enough to your TV that your HDMI cable can reach. TV or sound system speakers can befuddle the Fire TV Cubeâs built-in microphone, so make sure all speakers are at least 1 to 2 feet away from your Fire TV Cube. Make sure the Fire TV Cube is within range of your Wi-Fi network. Make sure the device is close enough that you can give your voice commands without having to yell. Depending on the ambient noise in your environment, this usually means being within 15 to 20 feet of the device. Donât store the Fire TV Cube inside a cabinet or other enclosed location. Position the Fire TV Cube with the four buttons facing up, and the Amazon logo facing where you usually sit when you watch TV. Get to know your Fire TV Cubeâs Alexa hardware Fire TV Cube is a combination of a streaming media device and an Alexa-enabled smart speaker. The latter means that you can send voice commands to the Fire TV Cube to control your TV and Fire TV, and the Fire TV Cube also responds to questions and other utterances. Before continuing with the Fire TV portion of the setup, it makes sense to first learn the basics of your Fire TV Cubeâs Alexa hardware. Taking a closeup look at the far-field microphone Computers have had either external or built-in microphones for a few decades, and, of course, smartphones and tablets have had internal microphones from day one. But the characteristic that all these microphones have in common is that they assume the speaker is relatively close â within a few inches or, at most, a foot or two. Move much farther away, and those microphones get notoriously unreliable because they have trouble distinguishing your voice from the background noise in your environment. That sort of second-rate microphone performance just wonât do for the Fire TV Cube whenever youâre relying on voice commands to get things done because those commands could be coming from 10, 15, or even 20 feet away. To get accurate and clear voice recordings, your Fire TV Cube relies on a technology called the far-field microphone, which is optimized to distinguish a voice from the ambient room noise even when that voice is far away. Your Fire TV Cubeâs far-field microphone uses some fancy-schmancy technology to accomplish this difficult task: Microphone array: The Fire TV Cubeâs âmicrophoneâ is actually an array of eight individual microphones, as shown by the circles in Figure 3-8. Note that these microphones are arranged somewhat narrowly from the front of the device to the back. The line created by this arrangement is the direction that Fire TV Cube expects your voice commands to come from. This is why, as I explain earlier (see âPositioning your Fire TV Cubeâ), you need to place your Fire TV Cube so that the front (where the Amazon logo resides) is pointing to where you sit when you watch TV. Noise reduction: Detects unwanted audio signals (known in the audio trade as noise) and reduces or eliminates them. Acoustic echo cancellation: Detects sounds coming from a nearby loudspeaker (such sounds are known as acoustic echo) â even if that loudspeaker is the Fire TV Cube itself â and reduces or cancels them to ensure accurate voice recordings. Beamforming: Uses the microphone array to determine the direction your voice is coming from and then uses that directional information to home in on your voice. Barge-in: The microphone ignores whatever media the Alexa device is currently playing â such as a song or podcast â so that the microphone can more easily detect and recognize a simultaneous voice command (thus enabling that command to âbarge inâ on the playing media). Speech recognition: Detects the audio patterns associated with speech and focuses on those patterns instead of any surrounding noises. Pushing the Fire TV Cubeâs buttons Your Fire TV Cube is built to be a hands-free device, which is a welcome design choice when you have one hand in a bowl of popcorn and the other clutching your favorite beverage. However, hands-free doesnât mean hands-off because your Fire TV Cubeâs outer shell is festooned with four buttons that you can use to control certain aspects of the device. Hereâs a summary of the available buttons: Action: Activates Alexa. That is, pressing the Action button is the same as saying Alexaâs wake word. Microphone Off: Turns the Fire TV Cube microphone off. When the microphone is off, this button glows red, as does the Fire TV Cube light ring. Press this button again to turn the microphone back on. Volume Up: Increases the volume (no surprise, there). Volume Down: You guessed it: decreases the volume. How to connect Fire TV Cube to your TV Your Fire TV Cube connects to your TVâs HDMI port, which on most TVs is labeled HDMI. If your TV has multiple HDMI ports (as most modern TVs do), then the ports are usually labeled HDMI 1, HDMI 2, and so on. Your Fire TV Cube has a built-in infrared transmitter that enables you to use voice commands to control other devices in your home entertainment system, such as your TV (for example, to turn it on and off), audio receiver, Blu-ray player, cable set-top box, or satellite receiver. In other words, your Fire TV Cube, besides being a streaming media device and a smart speaker, is also a universal remote! The IR transmitter (some folks call it an IR blaster) is inside Fire TV Cube, but it may not work for some devices that youâve stored inside a cabinet or other enclosed area. Are you out of the IR blaster game in that case? Not at all. Instead, you can connect the IR extender cable that comes with Fire TV Cube. Connect the IR extender cableâs jack to the corresponding port on the back of Fire TV Cube, and then position the cube end of the cable as close as you can to the enclosed device or devices you want to control. With your Fire TV Cube connected to your TV, grab the power cable that came with your Fire TV Cube. Connect one end of the power cable to the power port on the back of the Fire TV Cube, and plug the other end of the cable into a power outlet. Turn on your TV and change the input source to your Fire TV Cubeâs HDMI connection. How to set up Fire TV Cube Your Fire TV Cube comes with an Alexa Voice Remote that you can use to navigate the Fire TV interface. You may decide to opt only to use Alexa voice commands to control Fire TV, but you still need the remote to get through the initial configuration. So, before proceeding, remove the back cover of the Alexa Voice Remote, insert the two batteries that came with Fire TV Cube, and then reattach the back cover. When you tune to the Fire TV Cube HDMI port on your TV, the Fire TV Cube starts up for the first time and takes you through the following setup process: 1. On the Alexa Voice Remote, press the Play/Pause button. Fire TV Cube asks you to choose your language. 2. Use the Alexa Voice Remote to choose the language you want to use. I talk about how to use the Alexa Voice Remote in more detail in Chapter 4. For now, you use the Alexa Voice Remote to âchooseâ something by using the navigation ring to press Down (the bottom part of the ring), Up (the top part of the ring), Left (the left part of the ring), or Right (the right part of the ring) to highlight the item you want; then press Select (the circular area in the middle of the navigation ring). After a few moments, Fire TV Cube displays a list of nearby Wi-Fi networks. 3. Choose your Wi-Fi network. Fire TV Cube prompts you to enter the network password. 4. Use the Alexa Voice Remoteâs navigation ring to enter each character in your network password, and then choose Connect (or press Play/Pause on the remote). If your network password requires one or more uppercase letters, you can switch to uppercase characters by choosing the aA button or by pressing Menu on the Alexa Voice Remote. Fire TV Cube connects to your network and then checks to see if there is an available update to Fire OS, the operating system that runs Fire TV Cube. If an update is available, Fire TV Cube downloads and installs the software, which can take a few minutes. Note that Fire TV Cube may restart during this process. Eventually, Fire TV Cube asks you to sign in to your Amazon account. 5. Choose I Already Have an Amazon Account. Fire TV Cube displays the Enter Your Amazon Login ID screen. What if you donât have an Amazon account? No problem. Choose I Am New to Amazon; then use the Create Account screen to set up your account. 6. In the Email Address field, use the Alexa Voice Remoteâs navigation ring to type your Amazon accountâs email address, and then choose Next. Fire TV Cube displays the Enter Your Amazon Account Password screen. 7. In the Password field, use the Alexa Voice Remoteâs navigation ring to type your Amazon accountâs password, and then choose Sign In. By default, Fire TV Cube hides the password by displaying each character as a dot. If you want to make sure you entered the password correctly, choose the Show Password button. If youâve enabled two-factor authentication on your Amazon account, Fire TV Cube will prompt you to enter a code to verify the sign-in. Type the code that was sent to you, and then choose the Next button. Fire TV Cube confirms your Amazon credentials, signs in to your account, and then registers your Fire TV Cube. Fire TV Cube then asks which Amazon account you want to use. 8. Choose Continue. Fire TV Cube now asks if you want to save your Wi-Fi password to Amazon. This is part of a feature that Amazon calls Wi-Fi Simple Setup, which enables other Amazon devices you own (such as Echo smart speakers) to automatically connect to your network. This feature really makes setting up those devices easier, so itâs a good idea to let Amazon save your password. 9. Choose Yes. Fire TV Cube now prompts you to enable parental controls. 10. Choose No Parental Controls. Fire TV Cube asks if you want to set up your streaming services. 11. Choose No Thanks. If you do want to set up your services now, choose Get Started, and then follow the onscreen prompts. Fire TV Cube asks if you want Alexa to help you set up your TV and other equipment. 12. Choose Continue. If you donât want to bother with this, choose Do This Later, instead. To actually do this later, choose SettingsâEquipment ControlâSet Up Equipment. 13. Gather the remote controls for each device you want Fire TV Cube to control, and then choose Next. You need the remotes both to confirm when Fire TV Cube has successfully controlled some aspect of the device (by pressing the Fast Forward button) and to perform certain tasks that Fire TV Cube wants to learn how to perform itself (such as changing the input source on your TV). Fire TV Cube runs through your devices, trying each time to detect the device automatically. If Fire TV Cube detects an incorrect device, be sure to choose No and then select the correct device from the list that appears. 14. When the equipment setup is complete, choose Continue. Thatâs it! Your Fire TV Cube is ready to roll.\n\nView Article\n\nAmazon Fire How to Set Up Fire TV Stick or Fire TV Stick 4K\n\nArticle / Updated 02-28-2020\n\nIf you have a Fire TV Stick or Fire TV Stick 4K, you need to connect the device to your TV and then run through the setup procedure. The following discussion takes you through all the steps. How to connect Fire TV Stick to your TV Your Fire TV Stick connects to your TVâs HDMI port, which on most TVs is labeled HDMI. If your TV has multiple HDMI ports (as most modern TVs do), then the ports are usually labeled HDMI 1, HDMI 2, and so on, as shown. Newer TVs usually have all their HDMI ports on one side of the TVâs back panel, while on older TVs itâs common to have one HDMI port on the bottom of the TVâs back panel and a second HDMI port on the side of the back panel. The location of the HDMI port is important because the length of the Fire TV Stick (especially the longer Fire TV Stick 4K) often means that there isnât room between a bottom HDMI port and whatever surface the TV is sitting on for the Fire TV Stick to fit. If thatâs the case for you, then you have three possible solutions: Plug the Fire TV Stick into a side HDMI port, if you have one available. Mount the TV on the wall (which gives the Fire TV Stick plenty of room because thereâs no longer a surface immediately under the TV). Use the HDMI extender cable that came with your Fire TV Stick. In this case, insert the smaller end of the extender cable into the HDMI port on your TV; then connect your Fire TV Stick to the larger end of the extender cable. With your Fire TV Stick connected to your TV, grab the USB cable that came with your Fire TV Stick. Connect one end of the USB cable to the port on the side of the Fire TV Stick, plug the other end of the USB cable into the USB port on the power adapter that came with your Fire TV Stick, and then plug the power adapter into a power outlet. Turn on your TV and change the input source to your Fire TV Stickâs HDMI connection. How to set up Fire TV Stick Your Fire TV Stick comes with an Alexa Voice Remote that you use to navigate the Fire TV interface (either by pressing buttons or by using voice commands).

From this perspective, you learn what Fire TV is, how you get it, and how to choose a Fire TV device if you havenât jumped on the bandwagon as yet. You also take a tour of what Fire TV can do and learn how the Alexa voice assistant fits into everything. Getting acquainted with Fire TV People who are new to Fire TV usually find it very hard to grasp exactly what Fire TV is. So, if youâre struggling to understand Fire TV, rest assured that you arenât struggling alone. The best way I can think of to introduce you to Fire TV is to give you a bunch of analogous media scenarios: When you connect a Blu-ray player to your TV, you can use the player to watch Blu-ray movies on your TV. When you connect a CD player to your audio receiver, you can use the player to listen to music CDs through your sound system. When you connect a digital camera to your computer, you can use the camera to view its photos on your computerâs monitor. The common thread in all these scenarios is that when you want to watch (or listen to or view) a particular type of media, you connect one device that can play the media to another device that can show the media. Fire TV is another example of a device that can âplayâ media, and it uses your television to show that media. What type of media does Fire TV play, you ask? Thatâs an excellent question, and I answer it in the next section. What Fire TV does Watching television used to be simple: You turned on the set, tuned in to the channel you wanted to watch, and then settled in with your popcorn. Today, however, watching anything is complicated because content is scattered across multiple sources. One show is on Hulu, a second show is on Amazon Prime, another is on Netflix, and yet another resides on YouTube. Trying to keep it all straight is headache-inducing, and trying to coordinate your various devices, service addresses, and account logins is stressful. To solve all these problems, Amazon created Fire TV. No, despite the name, Fire TV is not a television. Instead, itâs a streaming media device (a term I define in Chapter 1) that connects to your existing TV. The purpose of Fire TV is to bring together most of the popular content services into a single interface on your TV. Connect Fire TV to your TV, switch to the Fire TV input, and you get quick access to apps for not only Amazon Prime, but also ESPN, HBO, Hulu, Netflix, Showtime, YouTube, and many more (more than 100 in all). You can also use Fire TV to play games, run apps, view photos, watch Internet videos, and more. Lots of devices and services claim to be a âone-stop shopâ for content, but Amazonâs Fire TV actually lives up to that billing. Fire TVâs components Fire TV isnât terribly complex, but for the whole streaming media thing to work, it does require a few components. Hereâs an overview of what you need to make the streaming magic happen: Streaming media device: To state the obvious, the most important component in any Fire TV system is Fire TV itself. Note, however, that there are two main flavors of Fire TV to consider: Fire TV device: This version of Fire TV is a separate device. As I write this in late 2019, Amazon offers three Fire TV devices: Fire TV Stick, Fire TV Stick 4K, and Fire TV Cube. Fire TV Edition: This version of Fire TV is built into another device, which is usually a TV set, but it can also be a soundbar (which is basically a sophisticated set of speakers rolled into a single, bar-shaped device). TV set: If you have a separate Fire TV device or a Fire TV Edition Soundbar, then you also need a TV to connect that device. Note that you canât use just any TV set with Fire TV â the only way to connect Fire TV is with an HDMI cable, so your TV must have an HDMI port. All reasonably modern TVs come with at least one HDMI port (and the latest TVs have two or more), but if your TV is old and doesnât have an HDMI port, then no Fire TV for you. Internet connection: Fire TV gets most of its content via the Internet. (I say âmostâ here because Fire TV Edition Smart TVs can also view live TV via a cable or antenna connection and you can also view photos and videos via an external storage drive.) Therefore, you canât do much with Fire TV without Internet access. To that end, you need your home network to be connected to the Internet, and you then connect Fire TV to your network via Wi-Fi (for kicks, a wired connection directly to your router is also possible). Apps: Itâs important to understand that Fire TV itself doesnât come with any content. Instead, Fire TV gets all its content from streaming services such as Amazon Prime Video, Netflix, and YouTube. How does Fire TV get that content? Through its collection of apps, each of which is provided by a streaming service and is a small program designed to access, play, and control the serviceâs streaming media. Many apps (such as Amazon Prime Video, if youâre an Amazon Prime member, and YouTube) are free, but most others (such as Hulu and Netflix) require paid subscriptions. How Fire TV works Given the various Fire TV components that I outline in the preceding section, hereâs the general procedure that happens when you interact with Fire TV to play some media: Turn on your TV. If youâre using a separate Fire TV device, change your TVâs input or source to the HDMI connection used by Fire TV. You see the Fire TV interface. Note: If youâre using a Fire TV Edition Smart TV, you see the Fire TV interface automatically when you turn on the set. Use the Fire TV interface to choose the app for the streaming service you want to view. If this is the first time youâve opened the app and the app requires an account, youâre prompted to sign in to your account (or create an account, if you donât already have one). Sign in to your streaming service account, if required. The app displays the interface for the streaming service. Use the app interface to choose the content you want to view. The app plays the content, which appears on your TV screen. Use the buttons (such as Play/Pause, Rewind, Fast Forward, Volume Up, and Volume Down) on the Alexa Voice Remote to control the media playback. Which Fire TV device you need To help you make the right Fire TV decision, in this section I offer a quick look at whatâs available from both Amazon and third-party manufacturers. Then I help you choose the right device for your needs. First, the devices: Fire TV Stick: Fire TV Stick (shown in the figure) is the simplest Fire TV device because itâs designed to work with TVs that offer High Definition (HD) picture-quality resolutions of 720p or 1080p. Fire TV Stick 4K: Fire TV Stick 4K is designed to work with todayâs higher-resolution TVs that offer up to 4K Ultra-High Definition (UHD) picture quality. Fire TV Cube: Fire TV Cube is the most powerful Fire TV device. Not only does it support up to 4K UHD screen resolution, but it also comes with a built-in speaker, built-in voice recognition (meaning you can use the Alexa voice assistant to control your TV), and double the internal storage of the Fire TV Stick and Fire TV Stick 4K. Fire TV Edition Smart TV: A Fire TV Edition Smart TV is probably the easiest way to get into the Fire TV game because it doesnât require anything other than the TV â the Fire TV interface is built in and appears automatically when you turn on the set. Nice. Fire TV Edition Soundbar: A Fire TV Edition Soundbar has Fire TV built in and provides that interface to your TV via an HDMI cable connection. The soundbar typically also comes with powerful speakers and a subwoofer for ridiculously impressive sound from such a compact package. Okay, so which Fire TV device should you choose? That depends on your needs and budget, so here are some questions to help you decide: Are you on a tight budget? Go for the Fire TV Stick, which is the cheapest of the Fire TV devices. Do you have a new (or newish) TV that supports 4K Ultra HD? Go for the Fire TV Stick 4K, which is just a few dollars more than the Fire TV Stick, but you get awesome picture quality on shows that support 4K. Do you want to use Alexa to control not only your TV, but also other smart-home devices? Although you can do all that with a Fire TV Stick, youâd be better off springing for the Fire TV Cube, which responds to your voice commands even from across the room. Are you looking to buy a new TV? Consider a Fire TV Edition Smart TV, which comes with Fire TV baked in, so you get to enjoy Fire TV as soon as you turn on your set. Do you want the best sound possible? Go for a Fire TV Edition Soundbar, which offers rock-the-house sound without taking up half your living room. Learning what Fire TV can do Some people think a Fire TV device is nothing but a fancy-schmancy method for watching YouTube videos. Yep, sure, you can watch all the YouTube you can stand using Fire TV, but thereâs more â much more â that Fire TV can do. Let me show you what I mean. Watching movies and TV shows Because Fire TV connects to your television, it wonât come as any surprise to learn that most people use Fire TV as a one-stop-shop for accessing movies and TV shows. Fire TV comes with apps from all the major streaming services, including free services such as Tubi and YouTube, and paid subscription services such as Hulu and Netflix. Depending on where you live, your Fire TV device also comes with apps specific to your location, such as the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation (CBC) for Canadian users and the British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC) for users in the United Kingdom. Accessing other types of media Fire TV comes with apps that enable you to access a wide variety of other media, including the following: Music and other audio: Fire TV has apps for most popular music services, including Amazon Music and Spotify, which gives you access to millions of songs right there on your TV. Fire TV can also tune in to radio stations and play podcasts. Photos: Use the Amazon Photos app on your mobile device to load your photos to Amazon, and you can then view those photos using Fire TVâs Amazon Photos app. Sweet. Games: There are apps for hundreds of games that you can play right on your TV. Game categories include action, adventure, arcade, board, and cards. Internet: You can access other media content online using web-browsing apps such as Amazon Silk and Firefox. Apps: Fire TV boasts thousands of apps that you can access on your TV in categories ranging from education and finance to entertainment and lifestyle. Thereâs something for everyone. Watching and recording over-the-air TV If you add a Fire TV Recast device to your entertainment system, you can not only view over-the-air TV shows using a connected HDTV antenna, but also record those shows to watch later. Itâs a slick setup. Connecting devices Fire TV usually doesnât require anything extra, but if the need arises, you can augment your Fire TV system with either Bluetooth or USB devices. For example, if you want to watch TV without disturbing people nearby, you can connect a pair of Bluetooth headphones to your TV; if you want to view your own videos and photos on Fire TV, you can connect a USB storage drive. Controlling your TV with Alexa voice commands Alexa is Amazonâs personal voice assistant, which means you can get information and make things happen (such as playing music) with just voice commands. Alexa is built right into the Fire TV experience, which means you can control your TV, navigate the Fire TV interface, and control the playback of movies, TV shows, and other content with just a few, simple voice commands. Itâs cool in the extreme. Controlling your smart home Alexa is smart-home savvy, so it gives you voice control over many different home automation products, including lights, thermostats, baby monitors, security cameras, and door locks.\n\nView Article\n\nAmazon Fire How to Use Alexa to Control Smart-Home Devices\n\nArticle / Updated 02-28-2020\n\nWhatever Fire TV device you own, if youâre like most people, you probably think that what Fire TV brings to your home is an easily configured and navigable streaming media device. Thatâs certainly true, but Fire TV comes with a âbonusâ feature that lots of people miss: It turns your TV into a smart speaker, which means it can listen for, understand, and carry out your voice instructions or questions. The magic behind this wondrous capability is Alexa, Amazonâs powerful and popular voice assistant. All Fire TV devices are Alexa-friendly, which means you get access to the world of voice control of Fire TV devices without needing to buy anything extra. Even better, you can also use your Alexa-enabled Fire TV device to dive into the fascinating realm of smart-home automation, which enables you to use voice instructions to control lights, turn devices on and off, and much more. Unless youâre under 5 years old, you probably grew up in a home that was, well, dumb. You turned on lamps with a switch (or perhaps a clap), the thermostat told you only the current temperature, and the only task you could automate was setting your alarm clock. All that seemed perfectly normal at the time, but that dumb home is starting to look quaint when placed next to the modern idea of a smart home. What, exactly, do people mean when they add the smart adjective to the word home? The simple â and not all that helpful â definition of a smart home is a home that contains one or more devices that enhance your home life in some way. That word enhance is vague, I know, but itâs really the key to everything. How does a smart-home device enhance your home life? It comes down to three things: Convenience: You operate most dumb-home devices manually, meaning you have to walk up to the device and then flip a switch or adjust a dial. If someoneâs at the door, the only way to see whoâs there is to open the door or peek through the peephole. By contrast, you operate smart-home devices from a distance using an app or a voice assistant such as Alexa. If someoneâs at the door, your smart security camera lets you see whoâs there using an app or an Alexa device with a screen. Information: Dumb-home devices tell you either nothing about themselves or just the bare minimum. A dumb dimmer tells you nothing about the current light level, while a dumb thermostat shows only the current temperature. By contrast, smart-home devices are bristling with information â such as current settings, status indicators, and power usage â that gets relayed to an app or device for easy reference. Automation: Dumb-home devices just sit there until you do something. A dumb lamp goes on when you flip the switch and will stay on until you flip the switch back. A dumb thermostat will keep the house at the temperature you set, no matter what the time of day. By contrast, smart-home devices can be programmed. You can program a smart lamp to turn on and off automatically at specified times. You can program a smart thermostat to use your preferred temperature during the day, and to use an energy-saving lower or higher temperature overnight. Yes, some smart-home stuff is a solution in search of a problem. A smart water bottle that tells you when itâs time to take a drink and a smart hairbrush that lets you know when youâre not brushing correctly are among the dumber smart devices. On the other hand, even something as basic (in the smart-home world, anyway) as programming when your lights go on and off can both save you money by reducing energy costs and extending bulb life, and make your home more secure by making it look occupied even when youâre not there. Installing a Wi-Fi smart-home device If your smart-home device is Wi-Fi-friendly, go to your mobile device app store and install the manufacturerâs app. Then follow these steps to get your Wi-Fi smart-home device set up in the app: Plug in and, if required, turn on the smart-home device. Open the smart-home device manufacturerâs app. Initiate the procedure for setting up a new device. Look for a request named Add or Add [manufacturer] Device (where manufacturer is the name of the company), or just a big plus sign (+). The setup routine will tell the device to broadcast its Wi-Fi network. Open your mobile deviceâs Wi-Fi settings and look for the deviceâs Wi-Fi network. The figure shows a collection of Wi-Fi networks that includes WeMo.Insight.03C, which is a network broadcast by a WeMo Insight smart switch. Tap the device network to connect to it. When the connection is complete, return to the device app. The app automatically detects the new network and uses the connection to set up the device. This usually involves giving the device a name. Youâll often have to set up an account with the manufacturer, as well. The app will usually ask for your Wi-Fi credentials, which enable the device to connect to and operate over your network. Having the device on your network is also how Alexa discovers and operates the device, so this step is important. If you see a notice asking whether you want to upgrade the smart-home device firmware, by all means tap Yes or Allow or Update or whatever button answers in the affirmative. The firmware is internal software that runs the device. Keeping all your smart-home devices updated with the latest firmware is highly recommended because new versions of the software are often needed to patch security holes and improve performance. How to make automatic network connections with Wi-Fi Simple Setup The steps I outline in the preceding section mostly deal with getting a Wi-Fi-enabled smart-home device on your home network. The step where you need to connect your smartphone or tablet to the deviceâs temporary network always bothers me because it seems like an imposition. The Amazon engineers must have felt the same way, because they came up with a way to avoid that annoying extra step. Itâs called Wi-Fi Simple Setup, and it requires two things: An Echo device compatible with Wi-Fi Simple Setup â that is, a second-generation or later Echo, Echo Plus, Echo Dot, or Echo Show â thatâs already connected to your Wi-Fi network The password to your Wi-Fi network saved to Amazon If youâve checked off both items, then setting up a new device thatâs compatible with Wi-Fi Simple Setup â such as the Amazon Smart Plug or the AmazonBasics Microwave â is either easy or ridiculously easy. The ridiculously easy setup comes your way if you purchased your Wi-Fi Simple Setup device from Amazon. In that case, Amazon automatically associates the device with your Amazon account, which means that when you plug in the device, it will connect to your network automatically using your saved Wi-Fi password. Now thatâs ridiculously easy! If you purchased the Wi-Fi Simple Setup device from a retailer other than Amazon, then the device wonât be associated with your Amazon account, so it canât connect to your network automatically. Thatâs okay, though, because you can still use the Alexa app to add the device: Choose Devices-->Add (+)-->Add Device. Discovering smart-home devices using an Alexa skill If youâre not using an Alexa device that includes a smart-home hub (such as the Echo Plus and second-generation Echo Show), then you usually need to upgrade Alexa to work with your smart-home device. You upgrade Alexa by enabling the device manufacturerâs Alexa skill. This not only lets Alexa discover the device, but also upgrades Alexa with the voice requests that let you operate the device. Alexa can locate and connect to some smart-home devices without requiring a skill. For example, Alexa can work with a Philips Hue Bridge to control lights without needing a skill. Say, âDiscover devices,â and then press the button on top of the Hue Bridge to put it into pairing mode. Follow these steps to enable the manufacturerâs Alexa skill and discover the manufacturerâs smart-home device: Install the manufacturerâs app and use it to get your smart-home device on your Wi-Fi network. In the Alexa app, tap Devices. Tap the Add button (+) that appears in the upper-right corner. Tap Add Device. The Alexa app displays icons for some popular brands and some device categories. Tap the category that fits your device, and then tap the manufacturer. The Alexa app prompts you to perform the duties I outline in Step 1. Youâve done all that, so proceed. Tap Continue. The Alexa app opens the information page for the manufacturerâs Alexa skill. Tap Enable. At this point, what happens next depends on the skill, but youâll usually have to perform one or both of the following: Use the smart-home device app to give Alexa permission to access the device. Link Alexa to the user account associated with the smart-home device. When youâre done, tap Close (X) to return to the skill page. Tap Discover Devices. The Alexa app uses the manufacturerâs Alexa skill to search for available devices. Tap Done. With a manufacturerâs Alexa skill enabled, you can discover new devices by following Steps 1 through 5 and then tapping Discover Devices, or you can ask Alexa to run the following voice request: âDiscover my devices.â With your smart-home devices plugged in, turned on, and connected to Alexa, youâre ready to reap the harvest of all that labor: controlling those devices through Alexa using voice requests. Donât let all that power go to your head! The sections that follow outline the Alexa voice requests that are generally available for each type of device. Keep in mind, however, that the ways you can control a smart-home device through Alexa are almost always only a subset of what you can do using the manufacturerâs app. With a smart plug, for example, Alexa can only turn the device on or off, but the manufacturerâs app will usually let you schedule on/off times, turn the plug off automatically after a set time, and more. Controlling a smart-home device with Alexa Before getting to the meat of this section, you should know that there are actually three methods you can use to control a smart-home device: Voice requests: This is how youâll operate most of your smart-home devices. The rest of this section takes you through the most common voice requests for a selection of smart-home devices. Alexa app: If you have your Alexa device microphone turned off, you can still use the Alexa app to control your smart-home devices. Tap Devices, tap the device type (or All Devices), and then tap the device you want to mess with. The screen that appears contains the controls you can use. For example, the figure shows the device screen for a smart lightbulb, which includes two controls: a button for turning the device on and off and a slider for setting the brightness. Alexa device with a screen: Swipe down from the top of the screen to open the status bar, and then tap the icon for the device type (such as a bulb icon for your smart lights, plugs, and switches). Note, too, that after you issue a smart-home-device-related request to an Alexa device with a screen, you see some device controls on the screen for a few seconds. How to turn smart plugs on and off If youâre curious about smart-home technology, but you donât want to spend a ton of money or time, a smart outlet â most often called a smart plug â is the way to go. A smart plug is an electrical outlet that you can control with voice requests. The smart outlet plugs into a regular electrical outlet for power, and then you plug a non-smart device â such as a lamp or coffeemaker â into the smart outlet. VoilÃ ! You now have voice control over the dumb device. Do you have a bunch of nearby dumb devices that you want to control via Alexa? In that case, instead of getting multiple smart plugs, buy a single smart power strip. Note, however, that âcontrolâ here just means turning the device on and off using the following voice requests: âTurn [device name] on.â âTurn [device name] off.â Replace device name with the name you gave to the smart plug using either the manufacturerâs app or the Alexa app. How to work with smart lights Another easy and relatively inexpensive way to get your smart-home feet wet is with a smart lightbulb or two. You can buy a smart lightbulb for less than $20, and installing it is as easy as changing any regular lightbulb. You can also get smart lightbulbs that change brightness without a separate dimmer switch and that can display different colors. What if you have a large collection of lights in, say, your kitchen or living room? Swapping out all those dumb bulbs for smart versions would cost a fortune, so a better choice is a smart light switch that you can turn on and off with Alexa. For more control, you can get a smart dimmer switch that enables you to control the brightness with voice requests. Although a smart lightbulb is easy to install, a smart light switch is another matter because it needs to be wired to your homeâs electrical system. Unless you really know what youâre doing, hire an electrician to do the installation for you. Here are the voice requests to use to turn a smart lightbulb or light switch on or off: âTurn [device name] on.â âTurn [device name] off.â For dimmable smart lights (or smart dimmer switches), use any of the following voice requests: âBrighten [device name].â âDim [device name].â âSet [device name] brightness to [number] percent.â For smart lights that support different colors, use these voice requests: âSet [device name] to warm white.â âSet [device name] to cool white.â âSet [device name] to [color].â (For example, âSet Chill Room to blue.â)\n\nView Article"
