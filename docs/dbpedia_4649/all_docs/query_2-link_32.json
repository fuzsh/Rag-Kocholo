        "text": "(http://www.gseis.ucla.edu/faculty/kellner/kellner.html) Within the traditions of critical social theory and cultural criticism, there are many models of cultural studies. Both classical and contemporary social theory have engaged the relationships between culture and society, and provided a variety of types of studies of culture. From this perspective, there are neo-Marxian models of cultural studies ranging from the Frankfurt School to Althusserian paradigms; there are neo-Weberian, neo-Durkheimian, poststructuralist, and feminist studies of culture; and there are a wide range of eclectic approaches that apply distinctive social theories to the study of culture. The term \"cultural studies,\" however, has been most clearly associated in recent years with the work of the Birmingham Centre for Contemporary Cultural Studies and its offshoots, so my discussion will focus on its work and its immediate predecessors-although I will argue that the Frankfurt School anticipated many of the positions of British cultural studies. In the following study, I accordingly examine the specific origins of British cultural studies, its genesis and trajectory, and imbrication with social theory. My argument will be that cultural studies requires social theory and that cultural studies in turn is a crucial part of a critical theory of society. Origins of British Cultural Studies From within a thoroughly British context, immediate precursors of British cultural studies created a critique of mass culture in some ways parallel to the work of the Frankfurt School, while more positively valorizing traditions of working class culture and resistance. Richard Hoggart, Raymond Williams, and E.P. Thompson sought to affirm working class culture against onslaughts of mass culture produced by the culture industries. Richard Hoggart's The Uses of Literacy (1957) contrasted the vitality of British working class institutions and life with the artificiality of the products of the culture industry that were seen as a banal homogenization of British life and a colonization of its culture by heavily-American influenced institutions and cultural forms. During the same era, Raymond Williams developed an expanded conception of culture that went beyond the literary conceptions dominant in the British academy, conceptualizing culture as \"a whole way of life,\" that encompasses modes of sensibility, values, and practices, as well as artifacts (1958 and 1961). Arguing for the need to think together \"culture and society,\" seeing the importance of media culture, and overcoming the division between high and low culture, Williams produced an impressive series of publications that deeply influenced the trajectory of British cultural studies. He polemicized against the concept of the masses which he claimed was both condescending and elitist-as well as overly homogenizing, covering over real and important differences. This theme in turn came to run through the cultural populism which helped shape and distinguish British cultural studies. British cultural studies was also shaped by E.P. Thompson's studies of the English working class culture and valorization of forms of resistance (1963). Like Williams and Hoggart, Thompson"
