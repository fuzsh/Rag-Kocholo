        "text": "American actor and producer (born 1961)\n\nChristopher Peter Meloni ( ; born April 2, 1961)[1][2] is an American actor and producer. He is known for playing Elliot Stabler on the NBC legal drama series Law & Order: Special Victims Unit (1999–2011, 2021–present) and its spin-off Organized Crime (2021–present), for which he was nominated for a Primetime Emmy Award. He also played Chris Keller on the HBO prison drama Oz (1998–2003), and starred in and executive produced the Syfy series Happy! (2017–2019).\n\nMeloni's film credits include 12 Monkeys (1995), Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas (1998), Runaway Bride (1999), Wet Hot American Summer (2001), Harold & Kumar Go to White Castle (2004), Green Lantern: First Flight (2009), 42 (2013) and Man of Steel (2013).\n\nEarly life and education\n\n[edit]\n\nMeloni was born in Washington, D.C., the youngest of three children of Cecile (née Chagnon; 1926–2016),[3] a homemaker, and Charles Robert Meloni (1927–2012), an endocrinologist.[4][5][6] He has an older brother and sister. His maternal ancestry is French Canadian, and he is a descendant of Matthias Farnsworth and Edmund Rice.[7] His paternal ancestry is Italian; one great-grandfather was born in Sardinia and another was born in Velva.[8]\n\nMeloni attended St. Stephen's School,[9] now St. Stephen's & St. Agnes School, in Alexandria, Virginia, where he played quarterback on the football team. After graduating from St. Stephens, he attended the University of Colorado-Boulder where he took acting classes for electives. He earned a Bachelor of Arts in history in 1983. Following completion of college, Meloni went to New York, where he continued his acting studies with Sanford Meisner at the Neighborhood Playhouse School of the Theatre as well as the Center for the Media Arts.\n\nMeloni worked as a construction worker prior to getting his acting break. He has also worked as a bouncer, bartender, and personal trainer.[citation needed]\n\nCareer\n\n[edit]\n\nMeloni worked his way up the acting ladder with commercials,[10] short-lived TV series, and bit parts in a number of films. His first noticeable role was the hotheaded son of a Mafia don in the 1996 thriller Bound. He appeared as Robbie Sinclair's friend Spike in Dinosaurs in the early 1990s. He played criminal Jimmy Liery in eight episodes of NYPD Blue during 1996-1997 and the fiancé of Julia Roberts's character in the 1999 romantic comedy Runaway Bride.\n\nFrom 1998 to 2003, Meloni portrayed the bisexual criminal Chris Keller on the HBO series Oz. Law & Order producer Dick Wolf signed Meloni to play Elliot Stabler on Law & Order: Special Victims Unit in 1999. Meloni appeared on both Oz and Law & Order: SVU simultaneously until Oz was cancelled in 2003. Meloni was nominated for the 2006 Emmy Award for Outstanding Lead Actor in a Drama Series for his role as Elliot Stabler.[11] In May 2011, Meloni announced that he had been unable to agree on a contract and would not be returning for season 13 of SVU.[12] His character was written out as having put in his retirement papers. After nearly a decade, Meloni announced in March 2020 that he would be reprising his role of Stabler in the Law & Order franchise on a spin-off show titled Law & Order: Organized Crime. Meloni appeared in a crossover event during season 22 of SVU.[13]\n\nMeloni appeared as the character Gene in Wet Hot American Summer in 2001, the puppet-loving pediatrician Dr. Norris in a 2003 episode of Scrubs, and the character of \"Freakshow\" in the 2004 comedy Harold & Kumar Go to White Castle. He made a cameo in its sequel, Harold & Kumar Escape from Guantanamo Bay, as The Grand Wizard. In 2005, he appeared on Episode 107 of MTV2's adult puppet show Wonder Showzen in a series of parody public service announcements warning of the threat of cooties. He had an uncredited role as a gay hotel desk clerk in Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas.[citation needed]\n\nIn July 2009, Meloni portrayed DC Comics character Hal Jordan/Green Lantern in the DC Universe Animated Original Movie Green Lantern: First Flight. He briefly appeared in the first episode of the Comedy Central series Michael & Michael Have Issues, portraying himself for a fake film starring Michael Ian Black and Michael Showalter.[citation needed]\n\nIn 2012, Meloni joined the cast of True Blood during the series' fifth season as Roman, a \"powerful, 500-year-old vampire who sits at the head of the table of the Vampire Authority.\"[14]\n\nMeloni played Colonel Hardy, a supporting role, in the Superman reboot film Man of Steel, which was released in 2013.[15] That year, he played Brooklyn Dodgers manager Leo Durocher in the historical baseball feature 42. Meloni starred in the 2014 comedy They Came Together.[16] He stars as John Taylor in the video game Call of Duty: Black Ops III. In 2016, Meloni shot the heist film Marauders.[17]\n\nMeloni starred in and executive produced the Syfy series Happy!, based on the comic book series created by writer Grant Morrison and artist Darick Robertson, which premiered in 2017.[18] The series was canceled on June 4, 2019.[19]\n\nIn 2018, Meloni guest starred in two episodes of the FX drama series Pose, opposite Dominique Jackson.[20] He appeared on the third season of The Handmaid's Tale as Commander Winslow in 2019.[21]\n\nPhilanthropy\n\n[edit]\n\nIn 2004 and 2006, respectively, Meloni competed in the fourth and the eighth series of Bravo's Celebrity Poker Showdown; in the eighth series, he finished in second place, behind Robin Tunney, and ahead of Macy Gray, Joy Behar, and Andy Dick. He played for Feed the Children.\n\nHe appeared on Celebrity Jeopardy! on November 10, 2006, defeating fellow Law & Order stars Sam Waterston and Kathryn Erbe. Meloni split his $50,000 charity prize between the Big Apple Circus Clown Care Program and the Montefiore Advocacy Center. He also appeared on the program's Million Dollar Celebrity Invitational that aired on December 17, 2009. Although defeated by Joshua Malina and Harry Shearer, he won a $25,000 charity prize in the name of Smile Train.[citation needed]\n\nPublic image\n\n[edit]\n\nMeloni has appeared in many public service announcements in support of lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender issues.[22] In 1999, Meloni jokingly kissed Lee Tergesen (who played Tobias Beecher, Meloni's on-screen boyfriend on Oz) at an awards dinner for GLAAD. In 2006, Meloni was given the Human Rights Campaign's Equality Award, along with actor Jake Gyllenhaal and director Ang Lee, for his work on behalf of LGBT issues.[22][23] In addition, in 2011, Meloni appeared in the Human Rights Campaign's \"New Yorkers for Marriage Equality\" video.[24]\n\nMeloni was included in the 2006 edition of People magazine's Sexiest Men Alive.[citation needed]\n\nPersonal life\n\n[edit]\n\nMeloni married Doris Sherman Meloni (née Williams), a production designer, on July 1, 1995. They have two children through surrogacy, a daughter born in March 2001[25] and a son born in January 2004.[26] Mariska Hargitay, who co-starred with Meloni on Law & Order: Special Victims Unit and remains close friends with him, is the godmother to his daughter.[27]\n\nMeloni has three tattoos: a Cubist-inspired representation of the crucifixion of Christ on his upper left arm, a butterfly on his left upper thigh, and a Chinese astrological chart of his family on his right lower leg.[28] In 2007, Meloni was inducted into his high school's athletic Hall of Fame as a member of the undefeated 1978 football team, for which he was quarterback.[29]\n\nIn 2014, Meloni bought the house used in the television show The Adventures of Ozzie and Harriet.[30][31]\n\nIn 2021, on an episode of PBS' Finding Your Roots, it was revealed that Meloni is a distant relative of Nancy Pelosi.[citation needed]\n\nFilmography\n\n[edit]\n\nFilm\n\n[edit]\n\nYear Title Role Notes 1994 Clean Slate Bodyguard Junior Mr. Lanzarotta 1995 12 Monkeys Lt.
