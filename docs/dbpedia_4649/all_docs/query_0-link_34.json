        "text": "10/10\n\nI don’t know why it's taken me so long to reread the Stand. Certainly (unlike say The Tommyknockers or Misery) it isn’t because I didn’t enjoy it first time around, nor is it, despite its definitely extended length, because I found its beginning long winded or hard to get into. For whatever reason it’s been quite literally half a lifetime since I first read The Stand so; both due to my recent rediscovery of a love of Mr. King’s writing, and the far greater prevalence of apocalyptic and post-apocalyptic books today it was definitely time to give it another look.\n\nEven as a premise, The Stand is rather unique. A super flu virus, dubbed Captain Trips by its sufferers is released across America which wipes out more than 99% of the population, despite increasingly draconian efforts by the US government to cover up the fact: introduce martial law to a disintegrating social order and even infect other countries with strains of the virus too.\n\nWhat is truly unique however, is all of this is dealt with summarily in less than a week of real time, and less than twelve hours of the book’s monstrous 46 hour length. This is because after King has set the stage the real conflict begins. Through prophetic dreams some survivors are led to Mother Abigail, a saintly 108 year old Christian woman who speaks for God and the forces of good. Others however are led to Randall Flagg, The Dark Man, a creature whose been walking the highways of America in rundown cowboy boots, waiting for its hour to come around at last and the chance to forge a new society of torture and tyranny. So the stage is set for a confrontation of good and evil of quite literally biblical proportions, a confrontation which will lead to one simple moment, The Stand.\n\nOne of the most astounding things about The Stand is the fact noted by Floresiensis, that returning to King as a more experienced reader I realize just how carefully crafted the book is, especially since King was able to restore the 400 pages cut from the original edition for space reasons.\n\nMany authors have a distinctive writing style all their own, with their own quirks, strengths and weaknesses. King however has that rare gift of being able to shift his style, his use of language, even his scene pacing to evoke the mood he’s trying to conjure. From long deserted views of the American wasteland both pre and post virus, to the darkly mysterious depiction of Randall Flagg, to the series of short punchy vignettes which illustrate nasty little details of the spread of Captain Trips and the breakdown of society. King actually resembles his own creation Pennywise the clown, able to shift his form to give us new senses of fear wonder or mystery as occasion demands, popping up with unexpected surprises, or teasing out the pace or detail of a specific scene to evoke a certain note or colour, from the horrific terror of the New York Lincoln tunnel filled with cars and dead bodies, to the grotesquely comic idea of a glitzy hotel and famous casino turned into the seat for a brutal dictatorship.\n\nKing’s shifting style also insures that we really get inside the heads of the books 10 or so major players, see them grow and change, and understand their struggles both before and after the virus, indeed it is quite astounding that in a book whose basic underlying cosmology is so blatantly black and white, King creates such a range of characters with complexities and journeys to travel, particularly since we don’t necessarily know where their journeys will take them. Indeed from Larry Underwood, a successful rock singer battling with his own selfishness, to Harold Lauder, a frighteningly intelligent yet socially outcast sixteen year old trying to find his identity, to the Trashcan Man, a pitiable pyromaniac tormented by memories of bullying and abuse and his own love of fire, The Stand features some truly complex and three dimensional villains and heroes many of whom, like the quietly strong Stu Redman, learning disabled Tom Cullen and his friend, deaf drifter Nick Andros are characters we come to truly love.\n\nOne issue I did have with the book, is despite a few changes and updates to the setting for the 1990 uncut edition such as the insertion of President Reagan, the book still retains the flavour of the 1970’s when it was originally written. Of course minor anachronisms such as government protest groups and Larry’s ability to instantly write a hit rock and roll song and hold Hollywood pot parties are easy enough to overlook, however a more serious problem is the way gender affects characterisation and setting.\n\nMy lady accused King in much of his early work of writing his female characters as “wet tissues,” and unfortunately The Stand is no exception. Franny Goldsmith, the female character we see most of is a 21 year old student who finds out at the beginning of the book she is pregnant. I can understand King wishing to write a gentle female character, however in Franny King overshoots gentle and lands squarely in childish. From her actually quite unpleasant dismissal of her baby’s father as “weak” despite the fact that all we see of him is his desire to marry Fran and not run out on his child, and the way Fran rather cattily rejects Harold’s unrequited affection, not to mention Fran’s constant habit of crying literally at the drop of her hat and of course her absolute obsession about having a baby (accidental though her pregnancy was), Fran in general was a major disappointment.\n\nThis would matter less if there were a range of female characters in the book, but with the exception of the semi mystical mother Abigail most women we meet are emotionally needy and often dependent, indeed the closest thing we have to a competent or self sufficient female character is said to be a “women’s libber” and a lesbian (two terms which King implies are synonymous).\n\nThe book also features a large amount of subtle comments about women in its narration, from way men frequently describe their partners as of “my woman”, to Stu Redman’s rather disgusting assertion to the protective yet slimy Harold that he wouldn’t need to force a woman because he “had his hand”, to even the narrator’s note that “some girls you could possess” when Stu meets Fran, not to mention the fact that the new society that is formed still seems pretty strict on gender lines as regards division of labour.\n\nWhile some of these assertions may be taken as in character, such as Fran’s rather hysterical observation that she “needs a man” and that women’s liberation meant nothing in a post virus world, to mother Abigail’s disapproval of girls who take sex as a playground, (an attitude we’d expect in a woman born in the 1880’s), the fact that these attitudes spread into narrative voice and the general constancy of them did increasingly take me out of the book and alienate me from some characters.\n\nOf course this isn’t to say that all women, even in post-apocalyptic situations need to be hard as nails, any more than all men must show their sensitivity by constant emotional displays, but it is odd that a book which features such complexity in most of its characters so often falls down in depicting motivations when those characters had two x chromosomes.\n\nSadly it wasn’t even just the female characters who were affected by this. I was greatly disappointed in one scene when the likable and sensitive Nick Andros casually and rather brutally has sex with a psychotic and promiscuous girl almost on a whim, an action which seemed so out of character it was actively jarring, or when the otherwise straight up and honest Stu Redman rather casually talks about trips to brothels as though they were fairly standard nights out with the boys.\n\nYet not all the relationships in the book are problematic. Larry’s struggle with his demons and how this struggle reflects upon the woman Nadine Cross’s strange quest was one of the high points of the book for me. Indeed in Nadine King manages to achieve something I would have assumed impossible, feature a plot concerning a corruption by use of lust which does not objectify lust as an end in itself, but instead is focused entirely upon the weaknesses of his characters, both Nadine’s and those of her intended victims, especially given the genuinely touching relationship one of those victims already has, a relationship which you don’t want to see ruined.\n\nOf course as a confrontation between good and evil, you always need a villain, and Randall Flagg is one of King’s best known and most compelling creations, an iconic drifter come provocateur with demonic origins, mysterious powers and a dark, blazing charisma. What is especially compelling about Flagg is that even when you have read books like The Dark Tower and are aware who Flagg is and what his origins are, he still retains that sense of mystery and compelling enigma that he had on first reading, much the way Sauron remains a mysterious being however many times you reread Lord of the Rings; a feat which is doubly astounding given the views from Flagg’s perspective we get during the book since usually seeing things from the villain’s point of view is death to suspense. The Stand however shows its quality in one of the hallmarks of great fiction, even amazingly powerful demonic beings can’t see all ends, and Flagg’s plans are just as prone to go awry as others are, especially given how fallible, human and complex his minions are.\n\nOne thing I did find a little odd, was the book’s relationship to society. The US government are painted as the villains of the piece, not only releasing the super flu accidently but also going to increasingly more brutal lengths to cover up their blunders, even going as far as dispersing the virus world wide so that America can maintain plausible deniability. When Mother Abigail’s converts reach their destination a considerable time is spent debating the start of a representative government with political voting, in fighting and even the generally virtuous characters engaged in a little back room dealing to get their people in charge.\n\nWith discourses from Glen Bateman, an opinionated professor of sociology we are often treated to rather oddly nuanced views about the troubles of government and organisation, and even a minor suggestion that Flagg represents not just absolute evil but the structure and mystique of technological progress (a fact reinforced by Flagg’s own brutal, totalitarian government). This strand of the book did feel a little aimless, particularly because other than a vague sense of “society is bad” King doesn’t seem to have come down with any certainty on any given position, indeed King himself noted that he needed an explosive game changer to bring the action back on track. Of course not every book needs a political point, but with the concentration on themes of society and especially Glen’s rather gloom laden discourses King probably should have been a little more definite, indeed this is one of the few areas The Stand falls short of one of King’s later books as Under the Dome was far more definite with how its political anarchy intersected with its characters and setting.\n\nThat being said King does manage something in The Stand which I found extremely positive, he writes a book with not only an American setting, but one deeply rooted in American culture that does not alienate none American readers, indeed even though I found the political discussion a little aimless I did enjoy one section in which the survivors sing the American national anthem, because unlike the vast majority of writers King doesn’t rely on simply the invocation of “Truth, Justice and the American way”, to create an emotional scene, but simply works on what that particular thing means at this particular time to the people who have lost so much in a post-virus world, and since these are characters we care deeply about this is affecting for any reader, American or not.\n\nThe book’s ending has received a huge amount of criticism over the years, many noting that it is literally a Deus ex Machina. One thing however which people levelling this criticism miss, is that The Stand is unashamedly a book written in a Christian context. Several characters, especially Mother Abigail quite freely talk of messages from God and putting trust in God, and Flagg is depicted as much as “Satan’s imp” or the demon Legion as something extra dimensional. Whether one is a Christian or not, there is no escaping the fact that the Christian story; even considered as a story, has had a huge effect on the way western culture considers matters of good evil and power.\n\nThe power of Evil, as T. H. White’s Arthur reminds us, is built on one simple premise, might makes right. The Hero, the power of good is able to check that balance, to see the powers of good succeed despite lacking that might. The story of Jesus is significant because at rock bottom it is the story of a man who had little power beyond his convictions, spoke out against the evils of his day and succeeded. Yet Jesus was not a mighty Hercules, successful through superior strength of arms, nor even a wily Odysseus, successful through trickery or cunning. Jesus simply endured a horrific death, and showed his strength of conviction through that endurance; a conviction which was in the end rewarded.\n\nThis idea of the hero overcoming might through endurance is one of the most beautiful tropes in fiction, since it gives us hope that eventually the powerless (which sadly these days includes most of the world’s population), will be shown to be virtuous in the end despite their lack of military, economic or other types of might, and the powerful, the selfish and yes the evil will not conquer forever. After all Jesus himself mentions that it is the meek who shall inherit the earth, and the last who will be first.\n\nTolkien understood the power of this ideal when he wrote of a little hobbit carrying a heavy burden to Mordor. Rowling understood it when a boy wizard leapt before a murderous psychopath shouting a disarming charm, and King understood it when he called his own American Lord of the Rings “The Stand”.\n\nThe power of good in this case is not cunning or strength or a last minute power from inside, it is simply being there and enduring as evil ends.\n\nThis is why for me The Stand couldn’t have had any other ending and why I think King himself called The Stand “a work of dark Christianity”.\n\nLikely how well the ending works for you will depend upon your appreciation of this trope, since certainly if your looking for almighty heroes who punch out the bad guys or turn the tables in one last desperate bit of ingenuity, or suddenly gain power from inside themselves to win out you’ll be disappointed. If however you can appreciate the idea that King works to, the very “stand” of the book’s title, you’ll find the ending a beautiful and terrible experience.\n\nMy only minor niggle with the ending goes back to the books more serious issue, that of gender. All of the characters who take the stand are male, while the women are quite literally left at home to have babies. Only one relationship is actually given time to be depicted in light of the ending (and that involves the childish Fran). This is extremely disappointing since one extremely likable character is left hanging rather badly, and the “woman” of one of the men taking the stand is barely mentioned at all.\n\nIndeed here King seems to subscribe to the decidedly old fashioned idea that for a woman having a baby pretty much equals happily ever after, and it’s sad to see more complex relationships fall off because of that.\n\nKing has stated The Stand is the book he’s most commonly asked about, even though he doesn’t believe it’s his best book, and this I don’t find surprising. I could likely write ten times this amount and still just scratch the surface, since The Stand is at rock bottom a big book. Not just because of its length, but because of its complexity. King’s shifting style and moments of horror and cynicism cover a huge range of visions, experiences and ideas. Yes, some work better than others and some are rather dated, but there is no point being hung up on one issue or other when there is so much else to see.\n\nIn this review I’ve tried to give a flavour of the salient points of the book, and yet there are a massive amount of things I’ve not touched on, Tom Cullen’s unique M-O-O-N speech, Nick Andros struggles as a deaf person, Mother Abigail’s trip into the desert, King’s rather pleasant depiction of most survivors (though by no means all), as comparatively decent people, the interesting mix of poverty and plenty in a post virus world where companionship is now the new scarcity, the horrific problems of a world where simple medical operations are impossible, and on and on.\n\nSuffice it to say, if you call yourself any kind of reader of speculative fiction and can appreciate a truly rich and complex book, The Stand is a must read. Even if you’ve never read Stephen King before, even if neither horror nor post-apocalyptic are your usual genre choice, you won’t be disappointed.\n\nDark, 9.3/10\n\nThe Stand, first published in 1978, was nominated for the World Fantasy Award in 1979. It was author Stephen King's sixth work of fiction, a cross-over of epic fantasy, horror and dystopia which still remains one of the finest works of its type and the novel that King's legions of fans love most.\n\nThe Stand begins as the first days of the plague hits the US. Then come the dreams, dark dreams that warn of the coming of the dark man, the apostate of death, his worn-down boot heels tramping the night roads, the warlord of the charnel house and Prince of Evil. His time is at hand and as His Empire grows in the west so looms the Apocalypse.\n\nI first read The Stand in 1989 and I was completely blown away by it. The story, the characters, the tension - I had never read a book of its size so quickly. So, 23 years later I decided to read it again, finding that although I was able to remember certain parts, almost everything other than the memory of loving it had been forgotten. I found it interesting that King himself said, in the forward, that he doesn't think The Stand is amongst his best books, but the one he is asked most questions about. I would agree with the author here as books like It, Salem’s Lot and The Shining are better-written books but there is just something about The Stand, and if the reader connects with it they are in for a thrilling ride.\n\nSo what inspired King to kill of 99% of the world’s population? \"I love to burn things up,\" he said. \"It's the werewolf in me, I guess... The Stand was particularly fulfilling, because there I got a chance to scrub the whole human race, and man, it was fun! ... Much of the compulsive, driven feeling I had while I worked on The Stand came from the vicarious thrill of imagining an entire entrenched social order destroyed in one stroke.\"\n\nI am now old enough, and have read enough across all the varying literature that is available to confidently state that King is an excellent, and by many underrated, author. To put is simply, he is one of the greatest storytellers of his generation who is only pigeon-holed as a schlock horror writer by those who haven’t actually read his work. And The Stand is one of his best stories, not the best executed arguably but always compelling and never dull. And it's great to finally have it on Kindle, and it can now be read by commuters without having to carry the weight about as the uncut edition weighs in around at 1,400 pages (bigger than all 3 Lord of the Rings books put together!) and for many will be the biggest book they have ever read, and as such it is not just an enjoyment but also an achievement to complete. By the end the story, which reaches Biblical proportions, the reader will feel like they have been on a journey every bit as unforgettable as the characters themselves."
