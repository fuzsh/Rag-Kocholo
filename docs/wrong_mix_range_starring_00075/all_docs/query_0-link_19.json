        "text": "Softly, the night wind sings, A song of love, as your cradle swings as you drift to sleep, Hey you, little dreamer, in your crib so snug, Counting sheep, getting cozy, feeling warm and hugged. A bedtime story, for the starry night. Hush now, the sky’s so vast, Dream of your playgrounds Close those bright eyes, let the music flows and dance, In this lullaby world, where love and peace reside. In this lullaby kingdom, where stars twinkle and prance. From the moon to the stars, in the clouds so high, You're the littlest dreamer, under the night sky. With a heart full of wonder, and a soul full of life, May your dreams be sweet, till the morning's first light. In this lullaby kingdom, where stars twinkle and prance… Hush now, the sky’s so vast, Dream of your playgrounds Close those bright eyes, let the music flows and dance, In this peaceful moment, where love and peace reside."
