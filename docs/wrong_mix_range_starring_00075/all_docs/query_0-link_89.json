Read more Fantasia facts here.\n\nMarketing for the film Cinderella referenced a “Disneyland” before the theme park was completed\n\nFive years before Disneyland’s gates would open, ads for the film proclaimed, “It’s so full of the wonderful fun, hilarious characters, singable songs—the sheer enchantment that comes only from Disneyland.” While we know that Disneyland in Anaheim is definitely full of the enchantment the ad mentions, the park itself did not exist when Cinderella was in theaters! Read more Cinderella facts here.\n\nThe Great Mouse Detective showcased one of the earliest uses of computer animation\n\nFor the film’s climax—in which Basil confronts his archenemy Ratigan in a duel set against the clockworks of Big Ben—the filmmakers combined traditional hand-drawn artistry with the latest in technology. Animator Phil Nibbelink and Tad A. Gielow spent several months designing the interior of the mammoth clock. The exciting and experimental sequence paved the way for more computer animation, such as the groundbreaking ballroom scene in Beauty and the Beast (1991) and today’s computer-animated films. Read more The Great Mouse Detective facts here.\n\nLIVE ACTION\n\nThe Princess Diaries films were produced by Whitney Houston\n\nWhitney Houston, along with Debra Martin Chase and Mario Iscovich, produced both of The Princess Diaries films, as part of her production company, BrownHouse Productions.

Read more Who Framed Roger Rabbit facts here.\n\nSTAR WARS\n\nBefore his name was revealed as Grogu, The Child was just called “Baby” on set.\n\nTo be fair, that’s what we’d call him, too. Read more The Mandalorian facts here.\n\nThe visual effects team for Star Wars: The Last Jedi visited the largest salt plains on earth to film for visual reference for the Crait sequences.\n\nThe visual effects team traveled to the largest salt plains on earth—the Salar de Uynui in Bolivia—to shoot plates to help ground the Crait sequence in reality and steer the CG of the sequence. Read more about the visual effects of Star Wars: The Last Jedi here.\n\nJoonas Suotamo (Chewbacca) attended a “Chewie Boot Camp” with Peter Mayhew.\n\n“It’s funny, because this character is so loved and Peter Mayhew, who created this character, along with George Lucas, has been so instrumental in helping and giving me his blessing and giving me some tips in our weeklong session together, how to be this character,” said Suotamo. “It was fun because I never could have understood what went on underneath the mask of Peter Mayhew.” Read more stories from the Solo: A Star Wars Story cast here.\n\nMARVEL\n\nCaptain Marvel’s Goose the cat was actually portrayed by a team.\n\n“Goose is played by a team of four cats who all have their own specialty,” says executive producer Jonathan Schwartz. “There’s Reggie, there’s Archie, there’s Rizzo, and there’s Gonzo. They’re an A-team of cats who can all do one trick—because you can’t teach cats to do that much.” Read more about Goose the cat here.\n\nEvery single MCU character was considered for a role in Avengers: Infinity War.\n\nDirector Anthony Russo explains, “When we began developing this movie, we had a picture of every single character who’s been in the MCU and we hung them on the wall. We spent months and months talking about where we could go with each character. It was a very long, creative process.” Read more stories from the Avengers: Infinity War cast and crew here.\n\nDanai Gurira was the first Dora Milaje actress to shave her head for Black Panther.\n\nGurira recalls, “I was the first one to get my head shaved, and in theory, it sounded amazing. And then the day came and I was like, ‘Is it today?’”But despite her hesitation, Gurira ended up loving the new look once her fellow actresses joined her. “The pride started to grow,” she explains, “this pride around it, and this sort of embracing of this symbol of power in these women.” Read more stories from the cast of Black Panther here.\n\nTHEME PARKS\n\nImagineer X. Atencio penned the iconic song, “Yo Ho, A Pirate’s Life For Me.”\n\nAnimator and (later) Disney Legend Xavier “X.” Atencio made the transition over to Imagineering in 1965, leaving his fingerprints on iconic attractions such as Haunted Mansion and Pirates of the Caribbean. The Disney Legend penned two of the most iconic Parks songs: “Grim Grinning Ghosts” and “Yo Ho, A Pirates Life For Me.” X. had never penned a song or tune before approaching Walt with ideas for lyrics to accompany their latest, pirate-themed attraction. Read more Pirates of the Caribbean facts here\n\nWhile The Twilight Zone Tower of Terror is not inspired by one specific episode from the series, certain episodes did have a major impact on the attraction’s plot.\n\nThe episode “Little Girl Lost” inspired Imagineers to include the Fifth Dimension in the attraction—and maybe some more Easter eggs, if you listen closely in the Boiler Room. You can also physically watch part of a Twilight Zone episode during Rod Serling’s introduction of the attraction. The original footage of Serling was taken from the episode “It’s a Good Life,” but has now been transformed into the introduction for a new episode—one where you are the main character. Read more The Twilight Zone Tower of Terror facts here.\n\nThe Star Tours: The Adventures Continue flight number has a real-world significance.\n\nWhile your destination changes every time you ride Star Tours—The Adventures Continue, the flight number always remains the same: 1401. That number is a special shout-out by the Imagineers who designed the ride, since the street address for Walt Disney Imagineering is 1401! Read more Star Tours facts here.\n\nTHE MUPPETS\n\nJim Henson spent three days under water to film the “Rainbow Connection” sequence in The Muppet Movie. The Muppet Movie memorably opens with Kermit the Frog, perched on a log in the lush green swamp he calls “home,” playing his banjo and singing one of his now signature tunes: “Rainbow Connection.” The man behind the frog, Jim Henson, spent three full days under water inside a specially constructed “bathysphere,” operating Kermit through rubber-sleeved arms! Read more The Muppet Movie facts here.\n\nThe very first time Gonzo and Rizzo the Rat were paired together was in The Muppet Christmas Carol.\n\nWriter Jerry Juhl came up with the idea of using Gonzo as the film’s narrator; said Muppet performer Dave Goelz, “To add a disembodied narrator would have intruded into the film, so he came up with the idea of using Gonzo as sort of a Greek chorus, an unseen Charles Dickens, narrating and bridging the story. It worked incredibly well, and he also came up with the idea of adding a sidekick for Gonzo, who was Rizzo, and that sort of began their relationship as a duo.” Read more The Muppet Christmas Carol facts here.\n\nPIXAR\n\nCarl and Ellie’s ‘Married Life’ scene in Up was inspired by silent home movies.\n\nDocter said that he and Peterson initially designed Up’s classic “Married Life” scene with snippets of dialogue, but ultimately decided to go a “silent movie” route (accompanied by Michael Giacchino’s Oscar-winning score) after recalling the atmosphere of his parents’ home movies. “I grew up in a time where our parents took a lot of Super 8 movies of us,” Docter said. “When you watch them, of course it’s without dialogue—just the whirring of the projector. There’s something almost more emotional about it without the sound.” Read more facts about Up here.\n\nYes, the Pizza Planet truck is in Finding Nemo—you just have to be sharp-eyed to spot it.\n\nIn a blink-or-you’ll-miss it moment, you can see the truck whiz by the dentist’s office (aka 42 Wallaby Way). It’s seen as Gill is breaking down his escape plan to his gang of aquarium pals, Nemo included. Read more about the Pizza Planet Truck’s cameos in Pixar films here.\n\nBy the D23 Team\n\nRon Dominguez, a Disney Legend and former executive vice president of Walt Disney Attractions, passed away early today, January 1, 2021. He was 85. He is survived by his wife of 41 years, Betty, and three children from a previous marriage, Sheryl Ralston, Steve Dominguez, and Ronald K. Dominguez Jr, four grandchildren Joby Ralston, Tim Ralston, Chase Dominguez and Reid Dominguez. Great-Grandson Brooks. Ron had a brother, Paul, who had two daughters; Jonnie Jean Hofer, who resides in Iowa, and Melanie Harner, who was raised by the Dominguez family in California.\n\n“We are saddened to have lost a very dear member of our family, Ron Dominguez,” said Josh D’Amaro, chairman of Disney Parks, Experiences and Products. “Ron’s contributions to Disneyland are nearly incalculable. He was well-known among the cast and community throughout his tenure at the park and continued to show his support long after his retirement, guiding and mentoring leaders, including me, for decades. I am personally grateful for all that he has done for Disney, and want to express my deepest condolences to his family on behalf of every Disney Parks cast member around the world.”\n\nKnown as a “native Disneylander,” Dominguez’s family originally owned and lived on 10 acres of the orange grove-covered property that was purchased by Walt Disney for his theme park in 1954.\n\n“Our house was located right about where the entrance toPirates of the Caribbean and Cafe Orleans are today,” he once recalled. “The day we moved out, in August of 1954, we were walking in ditches and holes. Things were popping up around us because construction had to move ahead. They built Disneyland in a year.”\n\nRon, his mother, and brother all grew up on the Anaheim property. They had inherited it from Ron’s grandfather, who had purchased 30 acres of land in the area in the late 1800s. The day they moved away was bittersweet; as Ron recalled, “It was a very emotional day.”\n\nBorn on August 10, 1935, Ron later attended Anaheim High School and the University of Arizona, where he studied business administration. Then, on July 13, 1955, just four days before Disneyland opened, 20-year-old Ron took a summer job as a ticket taker at the new theme park. He found that Walt had moved his family’s two-story, Spanish-style house behind Main Street, U.S.A. for use as administrative offices.\n\nRon gives his former boss Doc Lemmon credit for encouraging him to extend his summer job. Within one year of joining Disney, he had been trained on every attraction and was named temporary supervisor of Main Street, U.S.A.\n\nOne of his most memorable stints was working as Davy Crockett on the Keel Boats. Dressed in a coonskin cap, Ron was a popular target for photographers. He didn’t relish the attention, and quickly asked for a transfer.\n\nIn 1957, Ron became assistant supervisor of Frontierland and went on to supervise Adventureland and Frontierland before being named supervisor of Tomorrowland in 1962. That same year, he became general supervisor of the west side of the Park and was later promoted to its manager.\n\nBy 1970, Ron was appointed director of operations, and, four years later, was named vice president of Disneyland and chairman of the park operating committee. In 1990, he was named executive vice president, Walt Disney Attractions, West Coast.\n\nThroughout his career, Ron developed strong relations with the City of Anaheim, devoting hours of service to local organizations and helping pave the way toward creation of a second local theme park, Disney California Adventure.\n\nRon Dominguez retired in August 1994 after 39 years of service to The Walt Disney Company.\n\nHe was inducted as a Disney Legend in 2000 and has a window on Main Street, U.S.A at Disneyland park.\n\nAs Disney Legend and Ron’s Disneyland colleague Mary Anne Mang once recalled, “If Ron has one fault, it’s not really believing how special he is to people: He touches people’s lives.”\n\nBy Courtney Potter\n\nDisney Cruise Line Unveils Look at Newest Ship: The Disney Wish\n\nIf you watched the Disney Parks Magic Christmas Day Celebration on ABC over the recent holiday (and/or DVR’d it for a nice “Christmas in July” treat this coming summer… or was that just us?!), you’ve seen this exciting tidbit of news—Disney Cruise Line just revealed a look at their latest amazing ship, the Disney Wish. For those who may have missed it the first time, or in case you’d like to check it out again, take a gander at the brand-new sneak peek clip, above.\n\nThe video showcases new details of the ship’s glittering Grand Hall, and offers a first look at the exquisite character statue at the base of the grand staircase. Inspired by the beauty of a fairy-tale castle, the Grand Hall truly sets the tone for an enchanted family vacation from the moment guests step onboard. And it’s a great setting for a statue of Cinderella, whose story is the perfect example of magic transforming wishes into dreams… and dreams into reality.\n\nThe Disney Wish is the first of three—yes, three!—new ships joining the Disney Cruise Line fleet through 2025. All three ships will be powered by liquefied natural gas and, at approximately 144,000 gross tons and 1,250 guest staterooms, will be slightly larger than the Disney Dream and Disney Fantasy. Look for the Disney Wish to set sail in the summer of 2022.\n\n5 Fantastic Things to Watch This Weekend\n\nWell, it’s finally here… we’ve made it to 2021, and there is plenty of fun stuff to watch from around the worlds of Disney for this first official weekend of the year.

And to wet our proverbial whistles, the good folks at Disney+ just premiered another intriguing teaser—which finds Wanda Maximoff (Elizabeth Olsen) and Vision (Paul Bettany) settling into their new home in Westview. But it doesn’t take long before they start to suspect things aren’t as they seem…\n\nDirected by Matt Shakman, with Jac Schaeffer serving as the series’ head writer, WandaVision is a blend of classic TV and the Marvel Cinematic Universe. Rounding out the cast are Kat Dennings, who reprises her role as Darcy Lewis from Thor and Thor: The Dark World; Randall Park, who reprises his role as Agent Jimmy Woo from Ant-Man and The Wasp; as well as MCU newcomers Kathryn Hahn, playing a plucky neighbor; and Teyonah Parris, playing Monica Rambeau, who was introduced as a child in Captain Marvel.\n\nLook for the series on Disney+ on January 15!\n\nNew Year, Big News from Shanghai Disneyland\n\nHot off the proverbial presses comes this fun news from our pals at Shanghai Disneyland: As of this writing, they’ve already passed midnight and are celebrating the first day of 2021. And during their incredible New Year’s Eve fireworks show (“Ignite the New Year”), they officially unveiled the new logo for their upcoming Fifth Anniversary celebration!\n\nThe logo’s debut, which illuminated Enchanted Storybook Castle (the world’s largest Disney castle), marked the start of the resort’s milestone year—and hinted at the many festivities and surprises in store for guests as the resort counts down to the Fifth Anniversary of its historic opening in June 2016. Disney guests and fans across the country—and around the world—are eagerly anticipating all the magical offerings that famously accompany a major anniversary at Disney resorts worldwide.\n\nBut that’s not all: Earlier this week, Shanghai Disney Resort celebrated a new milestone as construction continues in Shanghai Disneyland’s newest themed land, Zootopia! Leaders and representatives from the resort joined leaders from the Administrative Commission of Shanghai International Resort—as well as from Shanghai Shendi Group—to sign the final steel roof deck before its installation and watched as the attraction was topped out.\n\nAs the eighth themed land at Shanghai Disneyland, Zootopia will be the first-ever land of its kind, featuring a major new attraction that seamlessly blends Disney’s storytelling and state-of-the-art technologies in order to bring the beloved movie and its characters (including fan faves Judy Hopps and Nick Wilde) to life. We can’t wait to see what’s in store!\n\nBy the D23 Team\n\nEveryone has a reason to celebrate the new year—whether you’re picking up a new hobby, planning new adventures, or just excited to stop writing “2020” as the date on everything, the new year holds the promise of a new start. Over at D23, we can’t help but celebrate the new year for another reason: A new year means new Disney experiences! From can’t-miss movies to exciting theme park milestones, here’s what we’re most excited for in the world of Disney in 2021:\n\nUpcoming Films from Disney, Marvel, Pixar, and More!\n\nThe new year brings a bounty of opportunities to escape into the world of a movie. And there are so many worlds to explore this year—from the Italian Riviera to the fantasy world of Kumandra to the Marvel Cinematic Universe.\n\nWalt Disney Animation Studios has two films slated for release in 2021. On Investor Day 2020, Disney Animation announced that Raya and the Last Dragon, featuring the voices of Kelly Marie Tran as Raya and Awkwafina as Sisu, will be available on Disney+ with Premier Access in most Disney+ markets, at the same time as it is released in theaters, on March 5, 2021. And Encanto, which includes new songs by Emmy®, Grammy,® and Tony Award® winner Lin-Manuel Miranda, is slated for theaters in November 2021.\n\nIn June, Pixar Animation Studios is slated to debut Luca, a new original feature film that celebrates the universal theme of friendship. The film is set in a beautiful seaside town on the Italian Riviera, where a young boy—Luca—experiences an unforgettable summer filled with gelato, pasta, and endless scooter rides. He shares these adventures with his newfound best friend, but all the fun is threatened by a deeply held secret: They are sea monsters from another world just below the water’s surface.\n\n2021 also brings us a rollicking thrill-ride down the Amazon in Disney’s Jungle Cruise, starring Dwayne Johnson as wisecracking skipper Frank Wolff and Emily Blunt as intrepid researcher Dr. Lily Houghton, who has traveled to the Amazon jungle from London determined to uncover an ancient tree with healing abilities that could alter the future of medicine. Frank is enlisted to serve as Lily’s guide on her journey through the lush rainforest, and as the unlikely duo embarks on this epic quest together, they face innumerable dangers, supernatural forces, and escalating stakes—with Lily and Frank’s fate, and perhaps mankind’s, hanging in the balance. And Oscar® winner Emma Stone takes on the wickedly wonderful role of Cruella de Vil in Disney’s Cruella, a look at the rebellious early days of one of the most notorious—and notoriously fashionable—villains. Cruella also stars Emma Thompson, Paul Walter Hauser, and Joel Fry, and is directed by Craig Gillespie.\n\nUpcoming releases from Marvel Studios include Black Widow, starring Scarlett Johansson as Natasha Romanoff/Black Widow; Shang-Chi and The Legend of The Ten Rings, starring Simu Liu, Tony Leung, Awkwafina, and Michelle Yeoh; and Eternals, starring an incredible ensemble cast that includes Gemma Chan, Richard Madden, Kumail Nanjiani, Lia McHugh, Brian Tyree Henry, Lauren Ridloff, Barry Keoghan, Don Lee, with Kit Harington, Salma Hayek and Angelina Jolie.\n\nIn The King’s Man, among the films coming in 2021 from 20th Century Studios, one man must race against time to stop a collection of history’s worst tyrants and criminal masterminds who are plotting a war to wipe out millions. The film’s cast includes Ralph Fiennes, Gemma Arterton, Rhys Ifans, Matthew Goode, Tom Hollander, Harris Dickinson, Daniel Brühl, Djimon Hounsou, and Charles Dance. The upcoming animated feature Ron’s Gone Wrong is the story of Barney, a socially awkward middle-schooler and Ron, his new walking, talking, digitally connected device, which is supposed to be his “Best Friend out of the Box.” Prepare for an action-packed journey that demonstrates for both Barney and his robot BFF how wonderfully messy true friendship can sometimes be. Free Guy stars Ryan Reynolds as a bank teller who discovers he is actually a background player in an open-world video game, and decides to become the hero of his own story—one he rewrites himself. The mystery thriller Death on the Nile sees Belgian sleuth Hercule Poirot’s Egyptian vacation aboard a glamorous river steamer turn into a terrifying search for a murderer when a picture-perfect couple’s idyllic honeymoon is tragically cut short. Five-time Academy Award nominee Kenneth Branagh directs and stars as the beloved detective, joined by an all-star cast of suspects that includes Tom Bateman, four-time Oscar nominee Annette Bening, Russell Brand, Ali Fazal, Dawn French, Gal Gadot, Armie Hammer, Rose Leslie, Emma Mackey, Sophie Okonedo, Jennifer Saunders, and Letitia Wright. And later in 2021, the eagerly awaited adaptation of the original Broadway musical West Side Story, from Oscar-winning director Steven Spielberg, explores young love and tensions between rival gangs the Jets and the Sharks on the streets of 1957 New York—and it’s sure to make Disney fans’ hearts sing.\n\nAnd you’ll want to keep a steady supply of popcorn in the house throughout 2021. Among the eagerly anticipated films coming to Disney+ are Flora & Ulysses, a delightful comedy-adventure based on the Newbery Award–winning book about 10-year-old Flora, an avid comic book fan and a self-avowed cynic, who rescues a squirrel with unique superhero powers; Sneakerella, a music-driven modern fairy tale set in the avant-garde street-sneaker subculture of New York City, which stars Chosen Jacobs as El, an aspiring sneaker designer from Queens who dreams of becoming a ‘legit’ creative force in the industry—a dream he pursues with a little nudge from his best friend, along with a sprinkle of Fairy Godfather magic; Diary of a Wimpy Kid, based on the popular book series, which comes to Disney+ in 2021 as an all-new animated film; and Night at the Museum, which has a new twist when it arrives on the streaming service: This time it’s animated!\n\nTelevision Fun in 2021\n\nThe new year always holds so much promise… and for 2021, no truer words have been spoken.

ABC will welcome several new\n\nseries that are sure to delight, including Call Your Mother, starring Kyra Sedgwick; Rebel, inspired by the life of Erin Brockovich and starring Katey Sagal; and the brand-new game shows The Chase (hosted by The View’s Sara Haines and featuring three of Jeopardy’s greatest players) and The Hustler (hosted by Craig Ferguson).

That same day, Hulu will add Dead Poets Society to its library (among dozens of other titles). Looking for something new? Enjoy the highly anticipated season premieres of Nat Geo WILD’s The Incredible Dr. Pol (airing Saturday) and ABC’s The Rookie (airing Sunday).\n\nDr. Seuss’ Horton Hears a Who!—Friday, January 1, on Disney+\n\nThe 2008 film, based on the 1954 book of the same name, tells the story of eccentric nature teacher Horton the Elephant (voice of Jim Carrey), who finds a speck of dust floating in the Jungle of Nool. Upon further inspection, he discovers the speck harbors the tiny city of Who-ville and its residents, the Whos—whom he can hear but cannot see. Horton forms a friendship with the mayor of Who-ville, Ned McDodd (voice of Steve Carell), and promises to transport the city to safety. However, Horton encounters pushback from his neighbors, who refuse to believe that Who-ville exists. In addition to Carell and Carrey, the animated film’s all-star voice cast includes Will Arnett, Carol Burnett, Disney Legend Bill Farmer, Isla Fisher, Dan Fogler, Selena Gomez, Jonah Hill, Joey King, Jesse McCartney, Niecy Nash, Charles Osgood, Amy Poehler, Jaime Pressly, and Seth Rogen.\n\nThe Wolverine—Friday, January 1, on Disney+\n\nIn this 2013 film directed by James Mangold, century-old mutant Wolverine (Hugh Jackman) is lured back to Japan for the first time since World War II, finding himself in a shadowy realm of yakuza and samurai. He is pushed to his physical and emotional brink after he goes on the run with a powerful industrialist’s daughter (Tao Okamoto) and is confronted—for the first time—with the prospect of death. As he struggles to rediscover the hero within, he must cope with powerful foes and the ghosts of his own haunted past.\n\nDead Poets Society—Friday, January 1, on Hulu\n\nFans of this 1989 Touchstone Pictures drama can now stream it anytime they like! Set in 1959 at the elite Vermont boarding school Welton Academy, this timeless tale follows English teacher John Keating (Disney Legend Robin Williams). He’s new to the all-boys preparatory school, which is famous for its antiquated traditions and high standards. He uses unorthodox methods to connect with his students, who face immense pressure from the faculty and their parents. Over time, he inspires students like Neil Perry (Robert Sean Leonard), Todd Anderson (Ethan Hawke), and Knox Overstreet (Josh Charles) to live boldly.\n\nThe Incredible Dr. Pol—Saturday, January 2, at 9 p.m. ET on Nat Geo WILD\n\nNew year, new season!

He will face his biggest challenge as a police officer yet when he must come to terms with the choices he has made in pursuit of the truth. “I can’t undo the mistakes I’ve made, but I can help make them right,” he says in the trailer. “No matter what it costs me.”\n\nBy the D23 Team\n\nThe Disney+ Adventure Continues\n\nThis year brought new adventures in the world of streaming, both anticipated and surprising. At the beginning of the year, we enjoyed the debut of two adaptions of beloved books, Timmy Failure: Mistakes Were Made and Stargirl. The cinematic debuts didn’t end there: in light of cinemas impacted by closures due to the global health crisis, Onward, Frozen II, and Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker all arrived on Disney+ earlier than expected so we could get a head start on binge watching these soon-to-be classics. Over in a galaxy far, far away, Star Wars fans got double the excitement with the debut final season of Star Wars: The Clone Wars and season two of The Mandalorian. If you prefer belting show tunes to wielding a lightsaber, we bet your Disney+ watchlist includes Hamilton, which debuted in July with a filmed version of the original Broadway production. Now, any room you are in can be “the room where it happens”! As if that wasn’t enough plussing up for the year, on Christmas, Disney and Pixar fans got into the zone to experience the debut of Soul, which you can stream right now, no matter if it’s for the first or 30th time.\n\nJust last month, Disney+ celebrated its first year of streaming magic with the world, and you can check out our roundup of the platform’s inaugural year to read even more about everything new that made it into our Disney+ queue this year.\n\nAppointment Television\n\nIn such an unusual year, it was easy to find comfort in some incredible television from around the worlds of Disney—some of which was created under unprecedented circumstances. From brand-new seasons of ABC juggernauts American Idol (filmed remotely) and Dancing with the Stars (featuring new host and executive producer Tyra Banks, and filmed without its usual studio audience), to the amazing final season of ABC’s Marvel’s Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.… From the Disney Family Singalongs on ABC and Disney Holiday Magic Quest on Disney Channel (that kept both young and young-at-heart enthralled), to memorable special events like ABC’s broadcast of The 72nd Emmy Awards and Freeform’s Love in the Time of Corona… not to mention all the fantastic new content (way too much to list!) that still popped up—no matter the obstacles—on ABC, Freeform, FX, National Geographic, Disney Channel, Disney Junior, and Disney XD… it all made for truly “appointment television” all year long.\n\nAmazing Accolades\n\nOn February 9, Disney and Pixar’s Toy Story 4 was named best Animated Feature Film at the 92nd Oscars.® Producers Jonas Rivera and Mark Nielsen accepted the award alongside director Josh Cooley, who said, “We want to thank the moviegoing audience so much, especially those who grew up with Toy Story. We hope that your adventures with Woody and Buzz made growing up a little bit easier.” Disney releases earned four Academy Awards® in all for 2020. In addition to Toy Story 4’s big win, Taika Waititi received the Oscar for best Adapted Screenplay for Fox Searchlight’s Jojo Rabbit, and Ford v Ferrari, from 20th Century Fox, was honored in two categories, Sound Editing and Film Editing.

We’re so glad we were able to share the magic of Disney with our members this year, and we look forward unlocking all the magic of Disney for you in 2021!\n\nBy Beth Deitchman\n\nAs so many of our favorite Disney films have demonstrated, a wish is a powerful thing. And Disney’s new video series proves “The Wish Effect” is very real. For children with critical illnesses, a wish can bring hope, strength, and joy, so they can forget about treatment and just be a kid. And as you’ll discover in “The Wish Effect,” that impact continues long after a wish has come true. The Disney Parks Blog recently shared Tali’s wish for a Disney-themed RV camper and Henry’s selfless toy drive. The latest episode introduces TJ, whose wish to tour Walt Disney Animation Studios and meet with animators was granted in 2019.\n\nFor 40 years, Disney has worked with Make-A-Wish® to provide magic to kids like TJ of Suffolk County, New York. The 15-year-old has always been a Disney fan, but when he was diagnosed with leukemia at age 11, Disney animated films became an inspiration to him. Throughout his treatments, he watched classic films such as Lilo & Stitch, The Lion King, and Brother Bear over and over, and TJ spent hours sketching his favorite Disney and Pixar characters. It’s TJ’s goal to one day become a Disney animator, so his one true wish was to tour Walt Disney Animation Studios and meet some animators.\n\nDisney Animation welcomed TJ and his family to their studio in February 2019 for a spectacular day that began at the Walt Disney Animation Research Library (ARL), where Fox Carney, Manager of Research, and the ARL staff invited TJ to get a close look at original drawings from some of his favorite films, as well as sketches of Mickey Mouse and Donald Duck from the 1930s. Carney shared, “When I saw TJ walk in, his jaw just dropped, looking at our table of artwork. He said, ‘Wow, this really means something,’ and it shows a greater perspective when you see the connection that it makes with a child, and a child for whom this is so important.”\n\nTJ left the ARL with two very special keepsakes, his own pair of white archivist’s gloves, along with the third volume of Walt Disney Animation Studios – The Archive Series, Design, and memories to last a lifetime. “I don’t know if there are words to describe it,” he said.\n\nAt Walt Disney Animation Studios, TJ was greeted by a group of animators and directors who worked on some of his favorite films, including Aladdin, Lilo & Stitch, Zootopia, and Wreck-It Ralph. Over lunch, they talked with TJ about their own career journeys and offered encouragement for how he can move forward as he pursues his own dreams of working in animation. “Despite the adversity [he’s faced], there he is smiling, enthusiastic, and he’s loving every minute of it,” said director and animator Eric Goldberg, who supervised the animation of the wish-granting Genie in Aladdin.\n\nAfter a private tour of Walt’s Office, TJ returned to Disney Animation for some hands-on experiences designed to help him on his path to becoming an animator. Renato Dos Anjos, head of animation for Zootopia and Ralph Breaks the Internet, gave TJ an expert tutorial on computer animation, teaching him how to use a character rig and make it come to life through animation. And Alex Kupershmidt, a supervising animator from Lilo & Stitch—TJ’s favorite film—guided him through the process of character sketching (and gifted TJ with the one-of-a-kind drawings of Stitch they created together). TJ also spent time in Disney Animation’s “animation pit,” where dozens of animators stopped by to meet TJ and share stories about their work and careers.\n\nAs he prepared to return home to New York, TJ promised, “In a couple years, I’ll show up again and work here!” And since TJ’s unforgettable visit to Disney Animation, he has remained focused on the bright future that lies ahead. Recently, he and Zootopia co-director/writer Jared Bush reunited virtually for the latest installment of “The Wish Effect,” and TJ shared that he continues to work on his animation skills and heed the advice of the friends he made at Disney Animation.\n\nThe “wish effect,” goes both ways, Bush notes. “To celebrate [wish kids] for a day is so important, to allow them to look in the future and see what life is going to be like after they’re through this really hard part. It’s just really exciting to be part of that,” he said, and he told TJ that after spending time with him, the Disney animators were “feeling fantastic for days.”\n\nTogether, Disney and Make-A-Wish have made more than 140,000 wishes come true over the last four decades, and every part of The Walt Disney Company has played a role in these life-changing wishes—from theme parks around the world and Disney stores, to the television and movie studios. To learn more about the many ways Disney is working with Make-A-Wish, and to see more episodes of “The Wish Effect,” visit wish.org/Disney."
