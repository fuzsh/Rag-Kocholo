What a great way to spend fun, quality time with the kids...and the whole family for that matter! It's a non-stop thrill ride of feline fun, complete with unbelievable twists and turns. A Rising Stars production, the show is cast with talented youngsters, all between the ages of 7 and 12.\n\nBased on the 1970 Disney animated film, the story unfolds In the heart of Paris, when we meet the eccentric millionairess who wills her entire estate to Duchess, her high-society cat, and her three little kittens. Laughs and adventure ensue as their greedy, bumbling butler pulls off the ultimate catnap caper. Now it's up to the rough-and-tumble alley cat, Thomas O'Malley, and his band of swingin' jazz cats to save the day!\n\nPresented by Victorium Legal, Inc., Disney's The Aristocats KIDS will run February 18 â€“ March 4, 2023 with performances on Saturdays at 2:00 p.m. & Sundays at 7:00 p.m. Tickets can be purchased online by clicking Link in Bio or directly from our Box Office at 340 Second Street, Woodland (Hours: Tues. - Fri. from 10:00 a.m. to 1:00 p.m. & 2:00 p.m. to 5:00 p.m.), and by calling (530) 666-9617.\n\nðŸ“·: Joshua Wheeler\n\n#WoodlandOperaHouse #RisingStars #WOHTADA #WoodlandOperaHouseTheatreandDanceAnnex #DisneyTheAristocats #DisneyTheAristocatsKIDS\".",
