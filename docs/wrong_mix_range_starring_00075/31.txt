The Woodland Opera House will be presenting “Disney’s The Aristocats KIDS” this month.

Based on the 1970 Disney animated film “The Aristocats,” the show follows an eccentric millionairess living in Paris who wills her entire estate to Duchess, her high-society cat, and her three kittens. After the greedy, bumbling butler catnaps them, it is up to Thomas O’Malley, the alley cat, and his band of swingin’ jazz cats to save the day.

“Featuring a jazzy, upbeat score, ‘Disney’s The Aristocats KIDS,’ is a non-stop thrill ride of feline fun, complete with unbelievable twists and turns,” a press release from the Woodland Opera House said.

A Rising Stars production, the entire cast is made up of talented youngsters all between the ages of seven and 12.

The show is set to open at the Woodland Opera House, located at 340 Second St., on Feb. 18 and will run through March 4. Performances are set for Saturdays at 2 p.m. and Sundays at 7 p.m. The show has a run time of approximately 30 minutes.
