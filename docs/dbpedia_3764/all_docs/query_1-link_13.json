        "text": "During the Stuart era, theorists, merchants, government officials, and everyday Englishmen and women tried to understand the rapid shifts in their economy. Such inquiry changed perceptions of how the economy worked. This article explores recent scholarship on economic thought in the Stuart era. It begins with Joyce Appleby's seminal book which sees economic events as the prime mover behind shifts in economic theory, and then considers Andrea Finkelstein's recent assertions that scientific and medical discoveries strongly influenced economic thinkers like William Petty and Thomas Mun. The article then examines a series of works that analyze the impact of politics on economic thought, how economic thought inspired literature, the interplay of economic thought and religion, and how those who were not economic literati viewed the economy.\n\nThe present paper examines and evaluates research experiences in the area of the history of Islamic economic thought during the last 30 years with the objective to see the pace of research and its coverage, both author-wise and idea-wise, and to determine the future research agenda in the light of the past progress and trends of the literature. The paper begins with a brief survey of the early literature on the history of Islamic economic thought, prior to 30-years, to provide a background. Then it studies and evaluates the research during the last thirty years, 1976-2006. It finds that hitherto the research in the history of Islamic economic thought has been language, region and period specific â€“ Arabic, the Middle East and up to 9th/15th century respectively. More attention has been paid to write on economic thought of few personalities than others. The situation is still worse in case of idea-wise research. However, this literature has exerted some effects on scholars of the main stream economic thought and a few of them are trying to rehabilitate it in the main body of economic thought. At the end, the paper emphasizes on need for intensive and extensive research to include more personalities, ideas, periods, languages and regions and to write a systematic history of the subject.\n\nThe existing literature on Islamic economics suggests that Islamic economics is a twentieth-century phenomenon with its roots in medieval Islamic intellectual and theological history, thereby leaving a centuries-long gap in the history of Islamic economic thinking. This study aims at taking a first step towards filling this gap by examining a nineteenth-century example of Islamic economics in late Ottoman economic literature. Suggesting a broader definition of Islamic economics, this article investigates a prominent Ottoman intellectual's efforts to define, reveal, and revive a tradition of Islamic economics in historical and intellectual context.\n\nReview of Abdul Azim Islahi, History of Islamic Economic Thought: Contributions of Muslim Scholars to Economic Thought and Analysis, Edward Elgar, Cheltenham (UK), hb, 2014, ISBN 9781784711375, viii+125 pagesThe publisher, in association with the Islamic Economics Institute at King Abdulaziz University (Saudi Arabia), where the author holds a professorship, brings to market a timely contribution to the efforts to raise the veil of ignorance between cultures. Aimed probably exclusively at the Western audience, as similar and much more consistent studies already target the Islamic economists, this book aims, first, at placing Islamic economic thought within the &#39;the family tree of economics&#39; connecting Greek ideas to classical economics to present-day mainstream economics, and, second, at drawing attention to several valuable insights underpinning Islamic economics that may enrich present economic thought, apparently of Western inspiration. In spite of terse prose, there is a ..."
