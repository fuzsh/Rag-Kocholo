S. Justice Department has never finalized the demand nor made it public, the action has generates a series of responses made by RT and the Russian government. Margarita Simonyan referred to this letter as a "cannibalistic deadline" and argued that this was an attempt to limit RT's functionalities.[8] Top Russian officials has also stated their stand with RT on this matter, and that a retaliation was likely to follow on U.S. foreign media.
