But you missed some thinks:\n\nAll Networkinterface change to dhcp\n\nall software special drivers (vmwaretools...) are to deinstall\n\nBefore start vmwareconverter execute Mergeide.reg\n\nOn the first Start IDE and rtl... is the right choice.

If everything is running fine, install virtiodrivers for Baloon and others. Then shutdown and do an Snapshot. After that you can do an install with virtio disk and network. Depending on you old 2003 machine that can damage the old 2003er server.

I have installed netKVM of the iso that you gave me, and it does not work, of the iso that folder is?\n\nAnd if not, can you send me the network drivers, intel E1000 or Realtek RTL8139 for windows 2003 server?\n\nI am very grateful for your help.\n\nocerda\n\nMember\n\nJan 2, 2018\n\n58\n\n1\n\n8\n\n32\n\nJul 10, 2018\n\n#9\n\nthanks for your help\n\nI have already solved my problems with the network.\n\nfireon\n\nDistinguished Member\n\nOct 25, 2010\n\n4,238\n\n407\n\n153\n\nAustria/Graz\n\ndeepdoc.at\n\nJul 10, 2018\n\n#10\n\nthanks for your help\n\nI have already solved my problems with the network.\n\nFine.
