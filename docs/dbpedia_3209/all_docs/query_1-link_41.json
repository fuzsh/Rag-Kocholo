However, crash-consistent backup of such VMs will of course still be supported. If you still need to support this for legacy reasons, then staying with 9.5 U4 is the way to go.\n\nRe: Upgrade v9.5 to V10 but cannot backup\n\nQuote\n\nPost by wishr » Mar 23, 2020 10:04 am this post\n\nHello,\n\nGuest processing is not supported for Windows Server 2003 due to VSS limitations so you should disable it to make the job work.\n\nPlease note, that according to the forum rules you should include a support case ID in your post when posting about any technical issue. Any topic not having a case ID will be eventually removed by forum moderators.\n\nThanks\n\nRe: Upgrade v9.5 to V10 but cannot backup\n\nQuote\n\nPost by mkaec » Mar 30, 2020 12:53 pm 2 people like this post\n\nWindows Server 2003 went EOL 4.5 years ago.
