Most of the time, I just can't connect to the Windows Shares!\n\nBut if, in the Connect to Server GUI, I use...\n\nServer: MyServerIPAddress; Type: Windows Share; Share: c$; Folder: /; Domain Name: MYDOMAIN (in capital letters); User Name: [email protected]; Password: MyPassword\n\n...then somehow I've been connecting to Windows Shares, some of the times!\n\nBut if I use the Server's name (instead of IP address), and if I use just MyUserName (without @MyDomain.local), then I can't connect to any Windows Shares at all.\n\nAnd that's on 2 newly-upgraded Ubuntu 12.04 PC's - one at work and one at home. Both have the same problem."
