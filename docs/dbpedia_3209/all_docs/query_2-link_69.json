        "text": "Like all good things, Windows Server 2003 is coming to an end. The popular server operating system from Microsoft’s end-of-support date is July 14, 2015. If you are surprised by how rapidly that date is approaching, that’s because altering a server is a detailed process. We urge your business to seriously consider the ramifications of waiting until the last minute to upgrade.\n\nTake, for example, Windows XP, which experienced its end-of-support date in 2014. Many users of this popular operating system didn’t take Microsoft’s promises to end support seriously; and as a result, they forsook necessary software patches and updates that protect these crucial computing systems from vulnerabilities. Unless you want to operate unsupported software on decade-old hardware, it’s imperative that you make plans to upgrade away from Windows Server 2003 immediately.\n\nMega-Byte Computer Services’s skilled IT technicians can help your business move away from Windows Server 2003 in the most efficient manner possible. Allowing us to make these adjustments to your infrastructure for you allows your business to avoid struggles that are normally related to upgrading a server.\n\nHardware Failure and Data Loss\n\nHow old is your server unit?\n\nIf your business’s server is running Windows Server 2003, there’s a fair chance that the hardware it’s running on hasn’t been upgraded in a very long time. If this is the case, your server machine is, at the very least, antiquated. When complex machinery like servers grow old, they have a tendency to become feeble and, therefore, prone to hardware failure.\n\nHardware failure can lead to data loss, which often causes extensive downtime that your business can’t afford. The IT professionals at Mega-Byte Computer Services can help your business integrate modern solutions that are less likely to falter, allowing your company’s server to function without a hitch.\n\nLimited Compatibility with Legacy Software\n\nWill older applications work on a new server?\n\nAside from hardware failure, there are more complications involved with upgrading away from Windows Server 2003. Your business takes advantage of a myriad of applications that might require different specifications. You might even have multiple underutilized servers that all run different operating systems and different applications, which makes your IT infrastructure unnecessarily complex and difficult to manage.\n\nSince upgrading from Windows Server 2003 will likely include migrating your data to a more modern server, some of these legacy applications might not be compatible with a new server unit. Mega-Byte Computer Services can help your business identify these discrepancies and discover the best solutions for these complications.\n\nLack of Critical Operating System Updates and Patches\n\nUnsupported means unprotected.\n\nWhen an operating system reaches its end-of-support date, Microsoft stops administering regular patches and updates that resolve security issues or bugs. The same can be said for Windows Server 2003. This means that your server will be vulnerable to emerging threats that aren’t patched on your hardware.\n\nNaturally, this is a cause for concern. While Microsoft does allow for custom support past the expiration date, the cost is far too steep for the average SMB. The benefits of upgrading make extending your use of Windows Server 2003 obsolete, so it’s recommended that you let Mega-Byte Computer Services help your business move toward a more recent server OS in favor of greater reliability and security.\n\nYou don’t want to wait until the last minute to upgrade away from Windows Server 2003. It’s an involved process that demands both time and a certain aptitude for technology. Mega-Byte Computer Services can help wean your business off of Windows Server 2003 and integrate new, modern solutions designed to improve efficiency. Give us a call at 888-755-0934 to learn more."
