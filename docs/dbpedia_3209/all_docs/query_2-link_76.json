        "text": "In this article, you will find an overview of Windows Server 2003 backup and recovery options using either the built-in NTBackup tool (backup app for Windows 2000, Windows XP and Windows Server 2003.\n\nSince NTBackup does not support image-based backups, we will also take a brief look at the differences between a file-level system data copy and an image-based backup.\n\nTable of Contents\n\nWhat Is System Image Backup?\n\nSystem image backup is a byte-to-byte copy of selected drive partitions with all corresponding file systems and boot metadata. You can even use this copy for exact recovery of the entire drive. This backup type helps in most disaster recovery scenarios, or it can be used as a part of a server maintenance procedure.\n\nFor more information on System Image Backup please refer to our guide:\n\nFurther reading System Image Backup and Recovery Guide\n\nWindows Server 2003 Image Backup with Built-In NTBackup\n\nThe built-in tool NTBackup does not support image-based backups - it only allows you to create a file-level backup covering all necessary data to restore from scratch. This copy combines full data backup with a few configuration files that you can use when booting from a Windows installation CD. This technology is called Automated System Recovery (ASR) and it is built into Windows Server 2003 as a part of the NTBackup tool that allows performing bare-metal restores in the event any local system disaster strikes.\n\nHere is a quick guide on how to perform an ASR backup:\n\nLimitations of NTBackup for Windows 2003\n\nBuilt-in Windows backup software is a powerful tool for a daily routine, but it has a few drawbacks you should remember:\n\nYou need to use a floppy drive during the restore process since Windows uses it to save pre-restore info such as disk configuration information and system signature. Though there is a workaround, you can use Remote Installation Server instead of a recovery floppy.\n\nASR does not have scheduling out of the box. You need to manually configure such backups using scripting including separately created .SIF files.\n\nASR is not intended to be used for server migration purposes, so any attempt to recover the system on another hardware can require additional efforts such as a hard driveâ€™s controller drivers installation.\n\nSummary"
