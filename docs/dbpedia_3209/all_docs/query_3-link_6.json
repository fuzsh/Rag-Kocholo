        "text": "I have to disagree here… Small Business Server isn’t the red headed step child of Microsoft\n\nIt’s a great solution for a small business that want to host their services in house. You can argue that it goes against Microsoft’s best practices, but when you get right down to it all most small businesses are going to have is one server anyway so buying the separate products is a waste of money that could be used elsewhere. However, I think their 75 user limit is a bit much… I wouldn’t (and don’t) use it for any more than 30 users. Once a company grows to that level you can buy the transition pack and migrate the SBS server to the Standard products. I’ve done it many times and it works nicely. All you do at that point is buy the media for the different software (Exchange, Windows, etc) and you have the Standard versions to install on other servers as you see fit.\n\nI mean, right out of the box you get Remote Web Work Place which means easy remote access for users, a one stop admin utility in Server Management that makes backup setup and monitoring a breeze, a fully functional server monitor in Health Monitor…\n\nI think Microsoft blew it with their first version of Small Business Server and it got a bad reputation. They turned the corner with 2003 and 2008. To say they don’t give it attention is just wrong. I dont’ recall any other update besides Exchange SP2 that they said not to install on SBS 2003. Later, they released an entire suite of service packs just for SBS.\n\nThey’ve turned it from a complete joke into a respectable product and they did it in about two years.\n\nI think their replacement for ME was actually Vista…\n\nSetup correctly SBS is the solution for small business, IMO."
