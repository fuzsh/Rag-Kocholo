        "text": "Systems Affected\n\nMicrosoft Windows Server 2003 operating system\n\nOverview\n\nMicrosoft is ending support for the Windows Server 2003 operating system on July 14, 2015. [1] After this date, this product will no longer receive:\n\nSecurity patches which help protect PCs from harmful viruses, spyware, and other malicious software\n\nAssisted technical support from Microsoft\n\nSoftware and content updates\n\nAll software products have a lifecycle. End of support refers to the date when Microsoft will no longer provide automatic fixes, updates, or online technical assistance. [2] As of July 2014, there were 12 million physical servers worldwide still running Windows Server 2003. [3]\n\nImpact\n\nComputer systems running unsupported software are exposed to an elevated risk to cybersecurity dangers, such as malicious attacks or electronic data loss.\n\nUsers may also encounter problems with software and hardware compatibility since new software applications and hardware devices may not be built for Windows Server 2003.\n\nOrganizations that are governed by regulatory obligations may find they are no longer able to satisfy compliance requirements while running Windows Server 2003.\n\nSolution\n\nComputers running the Windows Server 2003 operating system will continue to work after support ends. However, using unsupported software may increase the risk of loss of confidentiality, integrity, and/or availability of business assets and resources.\n\nThe \"Microsoft Support Lifecycle Policy FAQ\" page offers additional details. [2]\n\nUsers have the option to upgrade to a currently supported operating system or other cloud-based services. There are software vendors and service providers in the marketplace who offer assistance in migrating from Windows Server 2003 to a currently supported operating system or SaaS (software as a service) / IaaS (infrastructure as a service) products and services.[4,5] US-CERT does not endorse or support any particular product or vendor.\n\nReferences\n\nRevisions\n\nNovember 6, 2014 - Initial Release"
