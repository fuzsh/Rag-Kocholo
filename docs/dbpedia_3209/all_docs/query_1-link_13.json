        "text": "Well, XP is a desktop OS and 2003 is a server OS. That pretty much makes XP the desktop choice of the two, and also by far the most-used Microsoft desktop OS at the moment.\n\nEdit: To expand on the above, as a desktop OS, XP has wider driver support for random hardware. You're also less likely to run into issues with software that does naive version-checking. Finally, the UI is a little bit different, and designed by default with more of a desktop workflow in mind.\n\nWindows 2003 Server tweaked as desktop OS is faster, more reliable and stable than Windows XP (by a country mile). of course, this comes at a price, the $999 tag is a real showstopper here. :)\n\ndrivers are not really an issue, most mainstream hardware works just as well as in XP.\n\nAs noted by another answer utility software (e.g. Fine Print) needs a server version to run on Server 2003. If this is important then you need to stick with XP.\n\nOn the other hand, Server 2003 IIS is V6 (vs. 5.1 in XP) and allows multiple web sites (e.g. different host names or ports can have different default folders) and is significantly more advanced (major version newer). If you are doing web site development then you may well need 2003.\n\nAnother option would be to use Win7. This includes IIS7.5 (with the ability to define multiple web sites) and is a client OS for other software.\n\n(Licensing costs should not be an issue: you do have an MSDN subscription don't you?)\n\nPersonally, I previously used 2003 on my workstation (and was annoyed by not being able to use some utility software). These days I use Win7 (with VMs for when I need a server install).\n\nIf you're contemplating this question, you might be better off with a Linux Workstation. I know this might seem like an odd answer to your question, but if you're looking for an OS that is stable and reliable for desktop use, one of the major desktop Linuxes is probably your best bet. Hardware support is excellent these days too unless you're using a Lexmark Printer. If this is going to be a \"serious\" machine, you could certainly do worse since I doubt you'll be using the machine for gaming."
