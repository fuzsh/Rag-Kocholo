        "text": "Support for Windows Server 2003 is ending on July 14, 2015!\n\nWhat does this mean?\n\nIt’s being put out of its misery and will be joining Windows XP in the old operating system boneyard.\n\nWe are sending out this warning to help business owners prepare in advance. If you are still running Windows 2003 server, it is very important that you contact Enstep today to discuss your options. We want to make sure you are not left in the dust come July 2015.\n\n“End of support for Windows Server 2003 can have a dramatic impact on your business. It will mean no more updates or patches from Microsoft, which can result in a less stable and less secure infrastructure for your organization,” according to Microsoft.\n\nMany still use this server platform and when the cutoff transpires in July 2015, they will fail a compliance audit. This could have a horrible impact on a company, so it’s important to migrate to a new server sooner rather than later.\n\n“This could result in lost business or dramatically increase the cost of doing business, in the form of high transaction fees and penalties,” according to Microsoft.\n\nIt is important that you don’t wait until the last moment to choose the right migration plan. Upgrading and migrating to a new server takes a lot of planning and time so it’s critical that you start the process now."
