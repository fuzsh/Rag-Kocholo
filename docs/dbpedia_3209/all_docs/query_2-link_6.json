        "text": "Microsoft Windows is a computer operating system developed by Microsoft. It was first launched in 1985 as a graphical operating system built on MS-DOS. The initial version was followed by several subsequent releases, and by the early 1990s, the Windows line had split into two separate lines of releases: Windows 9x for consumers and Windows NT for businesses and enterprises. In the following years, several further variants of Windows would be released: Windows CE in 1996 for embedded systems; Pocket PC in 2000 (renamed to Windows Mobile in 2003 and Windows Phone in 2010) for personal digital assistants and, later, smartphones; Windows Holographic in 2016 for AR/VR headsets; and several other editions.\n\nA \"personal computer\" version of Windows is considered to be a version that end-users or OEMs can install on personal computers, including desktop computers, laptops, and workstations.\n\nThe first five versions of Windows–Windows 1.0, Windows 2.0, Windows 2.1, Windows 3.0, and Windows 3.1–were all based on MS-DOS, and were aimed at both consumers and businesses. However, Windows 3.1 had two separate successors, splitting the Windows line in two: the consumer-focused \"Windows 9x\" line, consisting of Windows 95, Windows 98, and Windows Me; and the professional Windows NT line, comprising Windows NT 3.1, Windows NT 3.5, Windows NT 3.51, Windows NT 4.0, and Windows 2000. These two lines were reunited into a single line with the NT-based Windows XP; this Windows release succeeded both Windows Me and Windows 2000 and had separate editions for consumer and professional use. Since Windows XP, multiple further versions of Windows have been released, the most recent of which is Windows 11. Since Windows 10, Microsoft has effectively turned to the \"Windows as a service\" servicing model, most likely to ensure it competes with mobile operating systems.\n\nList of Microsoft Windows

Upon the release of Windows 10 in 2015, the ARM-specific version for large tablets was discontinued; large tablets (such as the Surface Pro 4) were only released with x86 processors and could run the full version of Windows 10. Windows 10 Mobile had the ability to be installed on smaller tablets (up to nine inches);[26] however, very few such tablets were released, and Windows 10 Mobile primarily ended up only running on smartphones until its discontinuation. In 2017, the full version of Windows 10 gained the ability to run on ARM, thus rendering a specific version of Windows for ARM-based tablets unnecessary.\n\nName Release date Version number Build number Based on Windows RT 2012-10-26 NT 6.2 9200 Windows 8 Windows RT 8.1 2013-10-18 NT 6.3 9600 Windows 8.1\n\nMain article: Windows Mixed Reality\n\nName Build number Windows 10 Holographic, version 1607[27] 14393 Windows 10 Holographic, version 1803[27] 17134 Windows 10 Holographic, version 1809[27] 17763 Windows Holographic, version 1903[28] 18362 Windows Holographic, version 2004[28] 19041 Windows Holographic, version 20H2[28] 19041 Windows Holographic, version 21H1[28] 20346 Windows Holographic, version 21H2[28] 20348 Windows Holographic, version 22H1[28] 20348\n\nMain article: Surface Hub\n\nMicrosoft originally announced the Surface Hub, an interactive whiteboard, in January 2015.

Nashville[u] Windows 96 1996 4.1 999 Nashville was an operating system planned to have been released between Windows 95 and Windows 98, presumably under the \"Windows 96\" moniker. Neptune — Early 2000 NT 5.50 5111 Neptune, based on the Windows 2000 codebase, was planned to be the first version of Microsoft Windows NT to have a consumer edition variant. A version was sent out to testers but was never released.[31][32] The teams working on Neptune and Odyssey eventually combined to work on Windows XP. Odyssey — Early 2000 NT 6.0[33] — Odyssey was planned to be the successor of Windows 2000. The teams working on Neptune and Odyssey eventually combined to work on Windows XP. Triton — Early 2000 — — Triton was planned to be the successor of Windows Neptune and had been scheduled to be released in March 2001. Blackcomb — 2006-01 — — Blackcomb was originally planned to be a release of Windows following Windows XP. However, due to the large feature scope planned for Blackcomb, a smaller release codenamed \"Longhorn\" was planned first, and Blackcomb was delayed to 2003/2004. Both projects faced delays; Longhorn would go on to be released to consumers as \"Windows Vista\" in January 2007, while development on Blackcomb continued until the Blackcomb project was renamed \"Vienna\" in early 2006. Vienna — 2007-07 — — Vienna replaced Blackcomb and was intended as Windows Vista's successor. Vienna was eventually cancelled in favor of a new project codenamed \"Windows 7\" (which went on to be released in 2009 with the same name). Polaris — 2018 — 16299 Cancelled in favor of Santorini Santorini[w] Windows 10X 2021-05-18[x][35] 21H1 20279 Microsoft had been reported as working on a new \"lite\" version of Windows as early as December 2018.[36] Such a version was officially announced under the name \"Windows 10X\" at an event in October 2019; the operating system was intended to first launch on dual-screen devices. In May 2020, Microsoft announced that Windows 10X would instead be launching on single-screen PCs, such as laptops and 2-in-1 devices, first.[37] However, on May 18, 2021, Microsoft announced that Windows 10X would not be launching (at least not in 2021); many of its features were instead rolled into Windows 11.\n\nCodename Intended name Discontinuation Notes Photon Windows Mobile 7 September 2008[38] Originally a successor of Windows Mobile, it had been scrapped for Windows Phone 7[39][40] Phoenix — Early 2017 Cancelled when Microsoft \"wound down\" its phone efforts.[41] Andromeda — Mid-2018 Much of the work that was put into Andromeda was migrated into Santorini. The Surface Duo, a dual-screen Android-powered smartphone launched by Microsoft in 2020, was loosely based on the prototype hardware that had been used to test Andromeda.[42]\n\nCodename Intended name Discontinuation Latest known build number Cascades Windows Essential Business Server 2008 R2 April 7, 2010[x] 7224"
