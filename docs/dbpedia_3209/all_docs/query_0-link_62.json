        "text": "Migrating from Windows Server 2003 requires organizations to decommission existing Global Catalogs and domain controllers to conform with Active Directory schema in newer versions of the server OS.\n\nOf the many remediation efforts IT organizations must undergo when migrating off Windows Server 2003, the decommissioning of antiquated Active Directory domain controllers to implement the more robust Active Directory functionality in Windows Server 2012 R2 is a top priority. It's not optional and, in addition to application- and hardware-compatibility issues, is a key reason many organizations have put off sunsetting their Windows Server 2003-based systems, even though Microsoft has made clear for years that it'll no longer support it after July 14, 2015.\n\nBut migrating your Windows Server 2003 Active Directory DCs to Windows Server 2012 R2 -- the most recent and, hence, recommended target platform to replace the decommissioned servers -- doesn't have to be a showstopper. This step-by-step, click-by-click process through a test environment's AD schema will demonstrate how to upgrade your AD schema, raise the forest functional level to get a Windows Server 2012 R2 Global Catalog (GC) DC up and running. It will also explain how to take the necessary step of decommissioning existing Windows Server 2003 GCs and DCs.\n\nFor this article, the test environment consists of a single forest, a single domain AD with a single Windows Server 2003-based DC. Therefore, this DC is also the AD GC and holds all five Flexible Single Master Operations (FSMO) roles. In addition, the server acts as the internal DNS server for the AD domain. The AD forest functional level is Windows Server 2003. Although this functionality list might seem daunting, with a bit of planning and a methodical approach, migrating all of these functions is a straightforward process.\n\nRaise and Verify AD Forest Functional Levels\n\nPro Tip No. 1: If your organization's AD forest and/or domain functional level is still Windows 2000, it must be raised before going any further. Installing a Windows Server 2012 R2 DC into an existing domain requires the forest and domain functional level to be Windows Server 2003 or higher.\n\nVerify the functional level of the domain by logging into the Windows Server 2003 DC with a domain admin-level account. Click Start, expand Administrative Tools and then click Active Directory Domains and Trusts. In AD Domains and Trusts, right-click the domain name and then select Raise Domain Functional Level. If it shows anything less than Windows Server 2003 as the current domain functional level, drop down the list box for available functional levels. Select Windows Server 2003, then click the Raise button. Click OK when prompted and then you've raised the functional level. No reboot of the server should be required, but if multiple DCs exist, allow ample time for the changes to replicate throughout the domain. Replication time required could vary from 15 minutes to four hours or more, depending on your particular network design.\n\nVerifying the functional level of the forest is done in much the same manner. Log into the Windows Server 2003 DC with a domain admin-level account. Click Start, expand Administrative Tools and then click Active Directory Domains and Trusts. In AD Domains and Trusts, on the left side of the screen, right-click Active Directory Domains and Trusts. Note that this isn't the domain name as used in the previous step. After right-clicking Active Directory Domains and Trusts, a context-sensitive menu appears. Select Raise Forest Functional Level. Again, if the current forest functional level list box displays anything earlier than Windows Server 2003, select Windows Server 2003, then click the Raise button. Click OK to confirm under­standing that the change is permanent and affects the entire AD forest. Click OK when prompted that raising the forest func­tional level completed successfully. Just as when raising the domain functional level, no reboot of the server should be required. As always when making domain architecture changes, if multiple DCs exist, allow ample time for the changes to replicate throughout the domain. Remember, replication time required could vary from 15 minutes to four hours or more, depending on your particular network design.\n\nStep 1: Prepare a Windows Server 2012 R2 Server\n\nBegin with the basics. Set up Windows Server 2012 R2 on a new host, either physical or virtual. After installation, set a static IP and configure the subnet mask, gateway and DNS server settings consistent with the network (see Figure 1). Install any available critical and recommended Windows Updates. As a final step, join the new server to the existing AD domain. A basic Windows Server 2012 R2 member server is now up and running!\n\nStep 2: Add the AD DS Role on the New Server\n\nTo set up your target, log on to the Windows Server 2012 R2 server using an account with domain admin permissions. Open Server Manager. By default, the Dashboard view will display. Under Configure this local server click Add roles and features. The Add Roles and Features Wizard will open. Click Next. Click the radio button for Role-based or feature-based installation. Click Next.\n\nClick the radio button for Select a server from the server pool. In the list of displayed servers, verify the current server is highlighted (see Figure 2). Click Next.\n\nFrom the list of displayed roles, find and click the checkbox for Active Directory Domain Services. This will pop up a dialog asking to Add features required by Active Directory Domain Services. Click the checkbox to Include management tools (if applicable). Click the Add Features button to continue.\n\nFrom the list of displayed roles, verify the Active Directory Domain Services checkbox is still selected. Find and click the checkbox for DNS Server. Click Next.\n\nNotice in the Features list some options are already selected. Some of these represent previously installed features while others were selected when the Add features required by Active Directory Domain Services option was chosen earlier. Click Next.\n\nThe next step of the wizard displays a bit of background information regarding Active Directory Domain Services. Nothing mind-blowing or mind-boggling is presented here. Click Next. Another informational page explains DNS and its integration with AD. Click Next.\n\nThe final page of the Add Roles and Features Wizard displays a summary of the options selected for configuration. Click Install and watch the wizard work its magic! The wizard will confirm installation was successful while reminding you that additional steps are necessary to promote this server to DC functionality. Click the link to Promote this server to a domain controller (see Figure 3). The Active Directory Domain Services Configuration Wizard opens.\n\nStep 3: Promote the Windows Server 2012 R2 Server to a DC\n\nOn the initial page of the Active Directory Domain Services Configuration Wizard, select the radio button for Add a domain controller to an existing domain. Because this server is already a member of the domain, and is logged in using an account with domain admin-level privileges, the wizard will automatically populate the Domain and Credential information. Confirm everything, then click Next to continue.\n\nPro Tip No. 2: A warning appears that \"A domain controller running Windows 2008 or later could not be located in this domain...\" This warning applies to read-only DC (RODC) installation. Because you're not installing an RODC the warning can, and should, be ignored.\n\nThe next screen appears with the site name selected and both DNS Server and GC options already checked. If for some reason this isn't the case, select the appropriate site from the dropdown list and click the checkboxes beside the DNS Server and GC options.\n\nThink up a secure Directory Services Restore Mode password. Mix capital and lowercase letters, numbers, and special characters. Type it in both the Password and Confirm password boxes. Try and cheat the system with a simple password and an error will appear. Click Next.\n\nOn the next screen, ignore the warning \"A delegation for this DNS server cannot be created because the authoritative parent zone cannot be found...\" Click Next.\n\nClick Next on the Additional Options, Paths and Preparation Options screens. No changes are required.\n\nOn the Review Options screen, verify all the earlier selections. Interested in the Windows PowerShell commands that will run behind the scenes completing the DC promotion? Click the View Script button. Notepad opens displaying the necessary cmdlets, complete with customized parameters. The entire process is completed using just two cmdlets.\n\nClick Next. A Prerequisite check runs, ultimately displaying warnings about the DNS delegation error encountered earlier and a note about security setting defaults in Windows Server 2012 R2. These issues won't prevent completing promoting the server to a DC. Scroll down the results window and a green checkmark is displayed next to: All prerequisite checks passed successfully. Click \"Install\" to begin installation. This information is also displayed at the top of the window and is the all clear to proceed. Note, the server will automatically reboot after promotion to a DC. Click the Install button to kick things off.\n\nThe actual promotion process takes a few minutes. There's a lot to be done! The entire AD schema is being upgraded. The saying \"patience is a virtue\" comes to mind. Once the server reboots on its own, log on with a domain admin-level account. Congratulations! A new Windows Server 2012 R2 DC and DNS server is now up and running!\n\nStep 4: Transfer the FSMO Roles\n\nTransferring the five Flexible Single Master Operation (FSMO) roles isn't as difficult as it might seem. In fact, simply decommissioning the existing Windows Server 2003 DC will automatically transfer the FSMO roles. While automatic is attractive, manually transferring the roles isn't difficult and has the added benefit of granular control.\n\nTo transfer the Relative ID (RID) Master, PDC Emulator and Infrastructure Master Roles, log on to the newly minted Windows Server 2012 R2 DC using an account with domain admin-level privileges. On the Start screen begin typing Active Directory Users and Computers. The Search Charm opens. Click Active Directory Users and Computers from the results list. The AD Users and Computers app opens on the desktop. Right-click the domain name in the left pane, then select Operations Masters from the context-sensitive menu. The Operations Masters window appears, displaying three tabs; RID, PDC and Infrastructure. Each tab displays the current operations master for that role. The current server is also displayed along with a change button enabling the transfer of each role."
