        "text": "Following a management and maintenance regimen reduces administration, maintenance, and business expenses while increasing reliability, stability, and security.\n\nMaintaining Windows Server 2003 systems isn't always simple. Administrators facing the often-daunting task of maintaining a Windows Server 2003 environment must do so in the midst of daily administration and firefighting. Administrators have little time to identify, prioritize, and organize maintenance processes and procedures until after a preventable catastrophe occurs.\n\nWhen maintenance tasks are given proper priority in an enterprise, they can alleviate many of the more common firefighting tasks. To decrease the number of administrative inefficiencies and the amount of unscheduled fixes an administrator must go through, it is important to identify those tasks (e.g., service maintenance, log file review, and more) that are important to the systems' overall health and security. After they've been identified, routines should be set to ensure that the Windows Server 2003 environment is stable and reliable.\n\nThe processes and procedures for maintaining Windows Server 2003 systems can be separated based on the needs of the systems and the appropriate time interval between procedures. Some maintenance issues require daily attention, whereas others might require only quarterly checkups. The detailed maintenance processes and procedures that an organization follows depend strictly on the particular environment; however, the concept of placing tasks into daily, weekly, monthly, and quarterly categories works with all sizes and varieties of IT infrastructures.\n\nWhile these tasks might seem commonplace or mundane, they are often overlooked and they are critical to keeping the system environment and users working productively. As the number of servers and services within an environment increases so does the amount of time required to perform routine management and maintenance. As a result, many organizations are beginning to realize the importance of employing systems or operational management software such as Microsoft Operations Manager, NetIQ AppManager, IBM Tivoli, and others. Many of these products can monitor machines automatically, send alerts to administrators, and execute actions when they discover a problem.\n\nDaily Tasks\n\nSome maintenance procedures require more attention than others. Those that require the most are categorized as daily procedures. These procedures include checking the overall server health and functionality, verifying that backups are successful, and monitoring the Event Viewer logs.\n\nFirst, pay close attention to the myriad of patches and updates made available by Microsoft and other vendors to clear up performance and security issues. These service packs (SPs) and updates for both the operating system and applications can be critical components to maintaining your environment. There are several ways an administrator can update a system with the latest SP or update: CD-ROM, manually entered commands, Windows Update, Windows Update Services (WUS), or third-party products such as NetIQ Patch Manager.\n\nNo matter which method you use to pull down and apply patches, be sure to test and evaluate SPs and updates in a lab environment thoroughly before installing them on production servers and client machines. While the majority of such patches will install without incident, it only takes one serious patch problem to bring down your environment. It is a good idea to keep all system and application software consistent by installing the same patch levels to each server and client machine.\n\nThe Event Viewer is used to check the System, Security, Application, and other logs on a local or remote system. These logs can be an invaluable source of information regarding the system health. The event logs present on Windows Server 2003 systems are the Security, Application, and System logs. In addition, the File Replication Service, Directory Service, and DNS Server logs are present on domain controllers.\n\nAll Event Viewer events are categorized either as informational, warning, or error. Checking these logs often will increase your understanding of them. There are some events that constantly appear but aren't significant. Events will begin to look familiar, so you will notice when something is new or amiss in your event logs. Some best practices for monitoring event logs include understanding the events that are being reported, setting up a database for archived event logs, and archiving event logs frequently.\n\nTo simplify monitoring hundreds or thousands of generated events each day, the administrator should use the filtering mechanism provided in the Event Viewer or use one of the operational management packages mentioned earlier. Although warnings and errors should take priority, the informational events should be reviewed to track what was happening before the problem occurred. After the administrator reviews the informational events, he or she can then easily filter out the informational events and view only the warnings and errors.\n\nThe three event logs on all servers and the three extra logs on a DC can be archived manually, or a script can be written to automate the task. You should archive the event logs to a central location for ease of management and retrieval.\n\nThe specific amount of time to keep archived log files varies on a per-organization basis. For example, banks or other high-security organizations might be required to keep event logs up to a few years. As a best practice, organizations should keep event logs for at least three months.\n\nThe script logarchive.vbs (see Listing 1) can retrieve event logs and store them in a central location. The process might take a long time (up to a few hours) depending on the size of the log files as well as how many servers you're pulling from. Avoid running this script over slow WAN connections so that bandwidth is conserved.\n\nAnother file, logarchive.ini, is required when using logarchive.vbs. This file, shown next, contains a list of servers and the following archiving modes: T means purge after archiving; F means archive only.\n\nTo use logarchive.vbs, do the following:\n\nVerify that the logarchivelog.vbs and logarchive.ini files are in a pathed directory.\n\nRight-click the logarchive.ini file and type the list of servers on which you want to archive event logs.\n\nChoose Start, Run and type cmd to open a command prompt.\n\nAt the command prompt, type cscript logarchive.vbs.\n\nThe command in step 4 archives all the event logs for the servers that were specified in the logarchive.ini file. The log files are stored in the directory specified in the script. Logs will be labeled in the following format:\n\nservername_logname_date.log\n\nFor example, sfdc01_sec_02202004.log is the name for the SFDC01 server's Security log, archived on February 20, 2004. It is recommended that you label log files in the following manner:\n\n_sec_ Security log\n\n_app_ Application log\n\n_sys_ System log\n\n_rep_ File Replication log\n\n_dns_ DNS Server log\n\n_dir_ Directory Service log\n\nNote that logarchive.vbs does not purge the event logs.\n\nWeekly Tasks\n\nHardware components supported by Windows Server 2003 are reliable, but this doesn't mean that they'll always run continuously without failure. Hardware availability is measured in terms of mean time between failures (MTBF) and mean time to repair (MTTR). This includes downtime for both planned and unplanned events. These measurements provided by the manufacturer are good guidelines to follow; however, mechanical parts are bound to fail at one time or another. As a result, you need to monitor hardware weekly to ensure efficient operation.\n\nYou can monitor hardware many different ways. For example, server systems might have internal checks and logging functionality to warn against possible failure, Windows Server 2003's System Monitor might bring light to a hardware failure, and a physical hardware check can help to determine whether the system is about to experience a problem with the hardware.\n\nIf a failure has occurred or is about to occur, having an inventory of spare hardware can significantly improve the chances and timing of recoverability. Checking system hardware on a weekly basis provides the opportunity to correct the issue before it becomes a problem.\n\nDisk space is a precious commodity. Although the disk capacity of a Windows Server 2003 system can be virtually endless, the amount of free space on all drives should be checked daily. Serious problems can occur if there isn't enough disk space, including, but not limited to, application failures, system crashes, unsuccessful backup jobs, service failures, and more. To prevent these problems from occurring, administrators should keep the amount of free space to at least 25 percent.\n\nAnother major disk issue is caused by drive fragmentation. Whenever files are created, deleted, or modified, Windows Server 2003 assigns a group of disk clusters depending on the size of the file. As file size requirements fluctuate over time, so does the number of groups of clusters assigned to the file. Even though this process is more efficient when using NTFS, the files and volumes eventually become fragmented as the files do not reside in a contiguous location on the disk.\n\nAs fragmentation levels increase, disk access slows (see Figure 1). The system must use additional resources and time to find all the cluster groups in order to use the file. To minimize the amount of fragmentation and give performance a boost, the administrator should use the built-in Disk Defragmenter or a third-party tool such as Diskeeper to defragment all volumes.\n\nThe Domain Controller Diagnostic (DCDIAG) utility provided in the Windows Server 2003 Support Tools is used to analyze the state of a domain controller (DC). It runs a series of tests, analyzes the state of the DC, and verifies different areas of the system, such as\n\nConnectivity\n\nReplication\n\nTopology integrity\n\nSecurity descriptors\n\nNetlogon rights\n\nIntersite health\n\nRoles\n\nTrust verification\n\nDCDIAG should be run on each DC on a weekly basis or more often if problems arise.\n\nMonthly Maintenance\n\nWINS, DHCP, and DNS are three low-maintenance network services prevalent in most environments, but as with any other database, it's important to regularly check these databases to keep them running as efficiently as possible.\n\nWINS uses the Extensible Storage Engine (ESE) to store system entries, and these entries are being updated, added, or deleted continuously. Over time, the WINS database can contain a lot of unused space due to the abundance of changes. As a result, the database should be compacted to regain the unused space and to enable the system to service the environment faster and more efficiently. Windows Server 2003 dynamically compacts the database, but offline compaction is required periodically as well.\n\nThe first step in WINS database compaction is to make sure that WINS has been backed up successfully. With the exception of the first backup, WINS backups happen in Windows Server 2003 automatically. To back up the WINS database, select Mappings, Back Up Database within the WINS Manager and then specify a location for the backup files. Click OK and WINS will then back up its database automatically every 24 hours."
