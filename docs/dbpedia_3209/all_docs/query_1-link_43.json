        "text": "Ok, so here is the current situation. I have a new application. This application is used to control infrared devices (television sets, CATV set-top boxes, etc.) over the network, using specialized infrared emitter devices that hang off the Ethernet network.\n\nThis app is designed to run on a desktop computer running Windows XP. But for several reasons, I would rather install it on a virtual machine. The thing is, getting a licensed copy of Windows XP to run in a virtual machine is a big hassle.\n\nI do, however, have a Windows Server Datacenter Edition license, so I can run an unlimited number of instances of Windows Server operating systems in my virtual environment.\n\nI have asked the vendor to work with me to try running their application under Windows Server 2003 (32-bit) in a VM.\n\nI’m looking for information and guidance about what the primary differences are between Windows XP (SP3) (32-bit) and Windows Server 2003 (32-bit).\n\nI know you did not mention either of these, but if you have a Windows 7 machine, you can access Windows XP Mode ( http://www.microsoft.com/windows/virtual-pc/download.aspx ) and install it there… Again a VM environment, but another approach.\n\nI also do not see why it would not work in 2003, unless it is a 64bit version.\n\nThanks for the suggestion. XP Mode under Windows 7 is an interesting thought, but the major motivation behind wanting to virtualize it is to not have to have another desktop computer plugged in and running a lightweight application.\n\n“Every little utility program wants its own desktop computer.” That’s one of the reasons we wanted to virtualize in the first place – to get all these desktops back to being desktops, not mini-servers.\n\nDoug.B wrote:\n\nOk, ok, so beyond the obvious, I guess the general question is this: Will an application that is designed for Windows XP generally run normally under Windows Server 2003? And if not, what are the usual reasons why not?\n\nThe biggest issue I run into is installer files recognising you are not installing on the intended version of Windows. I get this with both drivers and applications. Drivers are typically easier to work around, since they can be installed to an XP system then copied over.\n\nThe next most common issue is parts of the operating system are configured differently, and need to have settings changed to match XP’s defaults. A great examples of this is Video Acceleration and Direct X related items.\n\nAll of the iR blasters I’m using on 2003 now are USB based, so I can;t comment directly on the network blaster.\n\nAt the end of the day, will it work? Probably and most likely without an issue. I’ve run many desktop applications on server systems for the simple fact that I already have server systems that run 24/7 and in the direction of consolidation, it made sense to run it on existing workloads or within Virtualization for the sake of efficiency. At the end of the day the answer of “will it work” will only be answered if you try it.\n\nGenerally though, the question is never “Can you get it to run?”, the question is always, “Will the vendor support it?”.\n\nMost of my vendors will provide support regardless of the platform it’s installed on, even if we didn’t go with their recommendations or stated supported platforms, however, I do have a few vendor that flat out will not support the system if not installed exactly as documented.\n\nCheck with the vendor and see i they’ll support it. If they will then go for it.\n\nAs for the licensing of a virtualized XP instance, that shouldn’t be a problem so long as you are a VL customer with SA. If not then go the with the server solution.\n\nDoug.B wrote:\n\nThe thing is, getting a licensed copy of Windows XP to run in a virtual machine is a big hassle.\n\nIf it is just a VM of XP you want on a server and no other devices will access the VM - then you could purchase a FPP Windows 7 Pro license. You would then need to add Software Assurance ONLY via VL agreement (Open,Select).\n\nBy purchasing FPP license of W7 Pro, assigning it to your server to run in a VM and adding SA - you get the rights to run XP Pro in a VM on your Windows Server.\n\nnote if you want other devices to access that XP VM, those devices are required to have SA or Windows VDA."
