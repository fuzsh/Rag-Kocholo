We saw it with the Death of XP, and the Death of Office 2003...and we're hearing echoes of it now with Windows Server 2003. Not because the new stuff is bad, or doesn't work...far to the contrary...but because change requires getting over fears of new things, and getting off your butt to make sure it is implemented correctly.\n\nIn sales I saw it a lot of this every day...and IT consultants have to help companies get over the Change Hump, there's no other way about it. So what can you do if you're in a business still using Windows Server 2003? Contact your IT Consultants (like the awesome folks at PCM who I can hook you up with, just ask), talk to them about what you're doing currently, and then they can help you form a strategy to prepare for the demise of Windows Server 2003.\n\nThis isn't as difficult as you would think it is...and if you aren't sure you can handle it by yourself, that's fine. Companies like PCM have migration assistance for you. Talk to experts...your friends/consultants CAN get you in touch with them.\n\nTackle this before it becomes a mess after the fact. You can thank me later. :)"
