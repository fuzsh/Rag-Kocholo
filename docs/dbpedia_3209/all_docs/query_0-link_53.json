Follow the steps below:\n\nInsert the Windows Server 2008 R2 DVD (or mount the .ISO) into your current Windows Server 2003 domain controller (DC)Â that holds the schema operations master role. You canÂ find out which servers hold the FSMO roles in your forest/domain here.\n\nIf the DVD âautostartsâ, ignore this error:\n\nThe above error only occurs as the DVD isÂ for 64-bit operating systems, and weâre using Windows Server 2003 32-bit.\n\nThe file we need to run isÂ adprep32.exe, which can be found on the DVD within [DVD drive letter]:\\support\\adprep:\n\nYou can type the path to adprep32.exe into a Command Prompt window, but I prefer to dragânâdrop the file, which will fill in the path for you (this is a favourite little tip I use quite often):\n\nNote: Before running this command, make sure you are logged in with a user that is a member of theÂ Enterprise, Schema, and DomainÂ Admins groups.\n\nAt the prompt, append /forestprep and press Enter.\n\nYou must now type C and press Enter to continue:\n\nOnce completed, this message isÂ shown:\n\nAs the schema has just been updated, you should wait until these changes replicate throughout the forest before completing the next step.\n\nPress the up arrow at the Command Prompt and the previous command will be displayed. Amend the command to adprep32.exe /domainprep, then press Enter. If your domain is not in Native Mode, the following warning isÂ displayed and the adprep command will not run:\n\nFind out how to raise the domain and forest functional level here.\n\nOnce you have raised the domain and functional level,Â adprep32.exe /domainprep will run successfully and display this message:\n\nTaking the advice from the message above, you should now runÂ adprep32.exe /domainprep /gpprep:\n\nLastly, if you wish to install a Read-Only Domain Controller (RODC), you will need to runÂ adprep32.exe /rodcprep to update the permissions on several AD partitions:\n\nAgain, you should wait untilÂ these changes replicate throughout the forest before adding the first Windows Server 2008 R2 DC to the Windows 2003 domain.\n\nFind out more on the adprep command.\n\nNow we have waited for the schema changes to replicate, letâs add theÂ first Windows Server 2008 R2 DC to the Windows 2003 domain:\n\nFrom the Server Manager control panel, click Change System Properties:\n\nUpdate the Computer Description, then click Changeâ¦:\n\nUpdate the Computer name, type in your Domain, then click OK:\n\nEnter the domain administrator username and password, then click OK:\n\nIf successful, the following message isÂ displayed:\n\nYou are now prompted to restart your computer:\n\nThe 2008 R2 server will now show in the Computers container in Active Directory Users and Computers:\n\nLastly, run dcpromo as you normally would on your 2008 R2 server.\n\nJob done!"
