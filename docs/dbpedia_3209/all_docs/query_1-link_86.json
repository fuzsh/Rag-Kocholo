Have I understood correctly when I say that from v10 we can only do entire VM restores, and no restores of application items and individual guest files/folders?\n\nBest wishes,\n\nPJ\n\nRe: Less Windows Server 2003 Support\n\nQuote\n\nPost by DGrinev » Jan 29, 2020 2:31 pm 1 person likes this post\n\nHi Per,\n\nYour understanding is partially correct.\n\nIt means we cut off the ability to do an application-consistent backup. However, crash-consistent backup remains a possibility. Also, you will still be able to restore files and folders using file-level restore functionality, restore application items by manually opening application databases files from an FLR session in Veeam Explorers.\n\nThanks!\n\nRe: Less Windows Server 2003 Support\n\nQuote\n\nPost by b_eugene » Mar 15, 2020 5:21 pm this post\n\nR2 too?\n\nRe: Less Windows Server 2003 Support\n\nQuote\n\nPost by Gostev » Mar 15, 2020 7:39 pm this post\n\nYes.\n\nRe: Less Windows Server 2003 Support\n\nQuote\n\nPost by thomas.biesmans » Mar 27, 2020 11:57 am this post\n\nHey Anton, for future versions: could you include platforms going out of support in the what's new documents as well please? Release notes also don't mention this reduced functionality clearly.\n\nCan only find a reference to it in your digest from January, not even in the various v10 presentations. Had forgotten about it in meantime, so was fairly surprised this morning after checking the backup jobs\n\nRe: Less Windows Server 2003 Support\n\nQuote\n\nPost by Gostev » Mar 27, 2020 5:06 pm 1 person likes this post\n\nHi, Thomas.\n\nThis information is available in the System Requirements for v10, which we have multiple copies of (in Release Notes, User Guide, Online Help etc.) specifically to make them easy to find no matter what route a particular user is used to taking with software upgrades.\n\nBut, I have no problems with including this information at the bottom of the What's New document as well. I don't think it's a bad idea at all to have a small summary of dropped platforms there.\n\nThanks!\n\nRe: Less Windows Server 2003 Support\n\nQuote\n\nPost by jsousa08 » Jul 08, 2020 4:24 pm this post\n\nHi all,\n\nThere is any Official Veeam Documentation on the compatibility for windows Server 2003 (and the limitations) for Veeam 10?\n\nThanks in advance.\n\nRe: Less Windows Server 2003 Support\n\nQuote\n\nPost by Gostev » Jul 08, 2020 4:47 pm 1 person likes this post\n\nHello, everything is documented in the System Requirements. To put it simply, Windows Server 2003 is not supported by v10 in any shape or form, except for crash-consistent backup. Thanks!\n\nRe: Less Windows Server 2003 Support\n\nQuote\n\nPost by Dariof » Sep 07, 2021 9:22 am this post\n\nHello\n\nfor Veeam 11 with windows 2003 is stiil valide the crash-consistent backup as possibility to restore ?\n\nRegards\n\nDario\n\nRe: Less Windows Server 2003 Support\n\nQuote\n\nPost by Mildur » Sep 07, 2021 9:53 am this post\n\nCrash consistent backup is always possible if the hypervisor supports the os as guest vm.\n\nVeeam doesn‘t need to connect to the os level if you enable „guest quiescing with vmware tools“.\n\nYou can find it in the guide:\n\nhttps://helpcenter.veeam.com/docs/backu ... ml?ver=110\n\nProduct Management Analyst @ Veeam Software\n\n[MERGED] Windows Server 2003 VM support\n\nQuote\n\nPost by SanjaySinghBisht » Oct 25, 2021 6:45 am this post\n\nHi,\n\nDoes Veeam Backup & Replication support backup of Windows Server 2003 VM in VMware ESXi 6.5.\n\nThanks in advance.\n\nRegards\n\nSanjay"
