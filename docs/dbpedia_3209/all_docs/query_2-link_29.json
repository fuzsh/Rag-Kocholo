        "text": "I’m not trying to be sarcastic when I say this: You can’t make it secure. You can mitigate the risk to a certain point, but the fact is, Microsoft doesn’t make security updates for that OS unless it’s really, really bad. Even with a server OS that is in support, there is risk of an exploit being leveraged that hasn’t been patched by Microsoft yet. If this is for a business, then it is a liability.\n\nIf you’re only using it as a file server, have you checked into using a NAS?\n\nBuy a NAS. A 16 year old operating system that hasn’t been updated in 4 years cannot be secured in my opinion. You also can expect it to remain accessible to current versions of Windows indefinitely. Take SMB1 for example - Microsoft Windows from using it because it’s so insecure and dangerous. You can FORCE windows to reconnect to it with registry settings, but that doesn’t make anything secure. WannaCry and NotPetya ransomware attacks exploited SMB1. Insist on using such old software and you’re at a far greater risk of a nightmare brought on by those kinds of attacks!\n\nSo bottom line, buy a NAS. Or upgrade the OS to something supported. Or disconnect EVERYTHING that touches it from the internet completely (almost certainly the least practical idea).\n\nIf you have your heart set on using it for file sharing. I would suggest making sure you have the last updates, and then go though and block all inbound ports with the exception of what you need for the file sharing services. If you are doing this for legacy systems I could kind of understand, but the fact that 2003 is very dated not just in security standards but technology in general. The NTFS it uses is not going to have the features that 2008 R2 let alone 2019 have. A better and more secure option would be to run SAMBA. Version 4 supports the same protocols and features that a 2003 Active Directory would have. I’d say look into that as the best alternative.\n\nI would be looking at FreeNAS or something else to run on the hardware (like CentOS and Samba), at least this can be kept up to date…\n\nOr a Synology NAS as others have suggested, using two for backup purposes and I am impressed with them so far.\n\nThank you to everyone with suggestions. I need to re-notify the manager about the seriousness of having this server even if it’s not on the internet and maybe go to a NAS or try to put samba or FreeNAS on the server. Any help with putting samba or FreeNAS on an old Dell server would be appreciated.\n\nMy plan is to get a 1 TB drive and put it in the Dell Server, load Ubuntu server and all the data and SAMBA. This can serve as a simple file server for as long as the machine will continue to run then when the machine quits invest in a NAS or something else by then. Doing this I’ll be able to have the Dell server drive still be separate with all the data but not running just in case the new drive has issues getting started. Any suggestions? Thanks for all the help."
