        "text": "Usually I can find an answer to PowerShell questions by researching forums and adapting. However, after searching high and low, I cannot find an answer.\n\nI am logged in as a domain administrator working on two enterprise servers in a test domain. $Server2003 is Windows 2003 server running PS v2. $Server2008 is Windows 2008 R2.\n\nProblem: When I am working from $Server2003 I cannot use any commands to access or verify information on $Server2008. This error happens regardless of who the administrator is.\n\nI have used PowerShell fairly extensively in our environments and haven't run into this error before. The error is not present when running commands from $Server2008 on $Server2003. In addition the error is not present when running commands from a production domain. I can also ping the 2003 or 2008 server regardless of which machine I am logged in as.\n\nExamples:\n\nFrom $Server2008: ping $Server2003 - returns pings\n\nFrom $Server2003: ping $Server2008 - returns pings\n\nFrom $Server2003: test-path \\\\$Server2008\\D$\\ - Get-ChildItem : Cannot find path '\\\\$Server2008\\D$\\' because it does not exist\n\nFrom $Server2008: test-path \\\\$Server2003\\D$\\ - True\n\nThe commands I want to run are a lot more complex than test-path; however, if I cannot get the simple command to work I doubt I'll have much luck with a complex one.\n\nThe two servers have the same domain, are in the same forest, and have the same domain controllers.\n\nAny ideas where to start?\n\nEDIT: Wanted to add that I have tried using test path from Server2003 to a different 2008 server located in our dev environment (same domain) and it runs the test-path and commands successfully."
