Many businesses are still reliant on this software which was released 10 years ago and if you are not already planning your upgrade, now is the time to start.\n\nEnd of support means that Microsoft will no longer provide critical updates or patches for the server and will not provide any critical technical support.\n\nMany businesses who continue to run Windows Server 2003 are doing so to run applications that will not work on most recent versions of Windows Server and for them the need for advanced planning is even greater. There will likely be a need to upgrade some or all of these applications to remove the reliance on Windows Server 2003."
