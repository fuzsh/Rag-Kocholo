        "text": "How has W2k3 worked for you? I was thinking of installing it on one of my systems since I would like to see if I can get a lean version of windows xp. Please if you can, go into task manager and check out the total commit charge. Please let me know so I can see how much less ram it uses compared to windows xp pro, thanks. Right now my XP Machine is using 203MB, BTW Please dont exaggerate and say its like 32MB, I want an honest answer. If you don't feel like posting just PM me the results because I too think windows XP is very bloated (64MB of ram to 200MB) complete retardation.....\n\nThanks.\n\nsince I would like to see if I can get a lean version of windows xp\n\nPlease read the previous posts on this. 2k3 server is not a 'lean' version of xp, in fact if you run the services that come with the OS it requires considerably more resources.\n\nPlease let me know so I can see how much less ram it uses compared to windows xp pro\n\nA few major flaws with this thinking:\n\n1. 2 systems are going to be running different services with different hardware and different drivers; so there is no direct comparison.\n\n2. the 2 systems are going to be running different applications (i.e. antivirus, firewall, etc.)\n\n3. And probably the most important flaw in this line of thinking. The OSes (yes both of them) are designed to use as much RAM as they can get their hands on; simply put unused RAM is wasted RAM, if you have unused RAM the system is supposed to allow the OS and applications to take larger chunks of it so they can operate better. In the event that you need the RAM for something else (i.e. you open a new application) the memory space allocated to the OS and other applications is adjusted accordingly. Having Windows suck 200MB of RAM is a good thing.\n\nIf you guys are having issues with XP as a desktop post your issues and we can probably help you to accomplish what you need. XP and Server 2003 really are virtually the same OS at the core and if configured similarly there should not be a significant performance difference (in either direction) between the two of them. Any differences you do experience are almost certainly to do with your configuration as well as the services and applications you are running. Take it from those of us who do this every day, there is no need to run 2K3 server as a desktop OS.\n\nAlso hopejr I've got to ask; if you can afford to run a ~$1000 OS on your desktop why cant you can afford some better hardware?\n\nEDIT: Fixed spelling mistakes"
