Server 2003 have C class IP & New server will be with A class IP, I want to make New server as domain controller & demote 2003 server but I want to keep the old server to be in network for few months.\n\nSo what can I do? Can I assign new server as Domain controller & Install AD, DHCP DNS on It & remove all the roles (AD, DHCP, DC, DNS) from old server.\n\nThe minimum Domain & Forest functional level required for the operation is Server 2008, so the 2016 Server cannot be promoted to a DC in this setup. An option would be to setup a temporary Hyper-V Server on the 2016 Server with 2012 R2 (your 2016 license should have downgrade rights, but check this out firstly). You can then migrate the AD to 2012 R2 Server and decommission the AD roles from the 2003 Server. Next upgrade the Forest & Domain Functional level to at least Server 2008, you will then be able to promote the 2016 Server as a DC."
