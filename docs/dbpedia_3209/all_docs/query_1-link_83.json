        "text": "Group of server operating systems by Microsoft\n\nNot to be confused with Microsoft Servers.\n\nOperating system\n\nWindows ServerDeveloperMicrosoftSource modelInitial releaseJuly 27, 1993; 31 years ago ( )Latest release21H2 (10.0.20348.2655) (August 13, 2024; 6 days ago ( )[1]) Latest previewvNext (10.0.26252) / July 11, 2024; 39 days ago ( )[2]Update methodDefault\n\nuser interfaceLicenseTrialware, SaaS, or volume licensingOfficial websitewww .microsoft .com /windows-server\n\nWindows Server (formerly Windows NT Server) is a group of server operating systems (OS) that has been developed by Microsoft since 1993. The first OS that was released for this platform is Windows NT 3.1 Advanced Server, an edition of Windows NT 3.1. With the release of Windows Server 2003, Microsoft started releasing new versions under the name Windows Server. The latest release of Windows Server is Windows Server 2022, which was released in 2021.\n\nMicrosoft's history of developing operating systems for servers goes back to Windows NT 3.1 Advanced Server. Windows 2000 Server is the first OS to include Active Directory, DNS Server, DHCP Server, and Group Policy.\n\nHistory\n\nWindows NT Server 3.x\n\nMain article: Windows NT 3.1\n\nWindows NT 3.1 Advanced Server was released on July 27, 1993[citation needed] as an edition of Windows NT 3.1, an operating system aimed towards business and server use. As with its Workstation counterpart, Windows NT 3.1 Advanced Server was a 32 bit rewrite of the Windows kernel that retained a similar use interface to Windows 3.1. Unlike the latter, however, Windows NT 3.1 Advanced Server was a complete operating system that did not need to be run from DOS. Windows NT 3.1 Advanced Server, like its Workstation counterpart, featured new features such as multiuser support and preemptive multitasking.[3] In 1994, Microsoft released Windows NT Server 3.5. It introduced TCP/IP and Winsock support integrated into the operating system, alongside the ability to use FTP. It also supported VFAT.[citation needed]\n\nIn 1995, Microsoft released Windows NT Server 3.51, an update to Windows NT Server 3.5, which added NTFS compression and support for the PowerPC architecture.[citation needed]\n\nWindows NT Server 4.0\n\nMain article: Windows NT 4.0\n\nIn 1996, Microsoft released Windows NT Server 4.0. It added the new user interface introduced in Windows 95 the previous year. In addition, it dropped support for the PowerPC, Alpha, and MIPS architectures. Microsoft updated Winsock to version 2 and IIS 2.0 and FrontPage are included.[citation needed]\n\nWindows 2000 Server\n\nMain article: Windows 2000\n\nWindows Server 200x\n\nWindows Server 201x\n\nWindows Server 202x\n\nMain articles: Windows Server 2022 and Windows Server 2025\n\nOn 2021, Microsoft has released Windows Server 2022. It is included the Windows 10 version 21H2 counterpart.\n\nWindows Server 2025 was annouced at January 26, 2024.[4]\n\nMembers\n\nMain releases\n\nMain releases include:\n\nWindows NT 3.1 Advanced Server (July 27, 1993)\n\nWindows NT Server 3.5 (September 21, 1994)\n\nWindows NT Server 3.51 (May 30, 1995)\n\nWindows NT 4.0 Server (August 24, 1996)\n\nWindows 2000 Server (December 15, 1999)\n\nWindows Server 2003 (April 24, 2003)[5]\n\nWindows Server 2003 R2 (December 6, 2005)[6]\n\nWindows Server 2008 (February 27, 2008)[7]\n\nWindows Server 2008 R2 (October 22, 2009)[8]\n\nWindows Server 2012 (September 4, 2012)[9]\n\nWindows Server 2012 R2 (October 17, 2013)[10]\n\nWindows Server 2016 (October 12, 2016)[11]\n\nWindows Server 2019 (October 2, 2018)[12]\n\nWindows Server 2022 (August 18, 2021)[13]\n\nWindows Server 2025 (Fall 2024, upcoming)[14][citation needed]\n\nTraditionally, Microsoft supports Windows Server for 10 years, with five years of mainstream support and an additional five years of extended support. These releases also offer a complete desktop experience. Starting with Windows Server 2008, Server Core and Nano Server configurations were made available to reduce the OS footprint.[15][16] Between 2015 and 2021, Microsoft referred to these releases as \"long-term support\" releases to set them apart from semi-annual releases (see below.)\n\nFor sixteen years, Microsoft released a major version of Windows Server every four years, with one minor version released two years after a major release. The minor versions had an \"R2\" suffix in their names. In October 2018, Microsoft broke this tradition with the release of Windows Server 2019, which should have been \"Windows Server 2016 R2\". Windows Server 2022 is also a minor upgrade over its predecessor.[17][18]\n\nBranded releases\n\nCertain editions of Windows Server have a customized name:\n\nWindows Storage Server (editions of Windows Server 2003 through 2016; editions of Windows Server IoT 2019 and its successors)[19][20][21]\n\nWindows HPC Server 2008\n\nWindows HPC Server 2008 R2\n\nWindows Home Server (an edition of Windows Server 2003)\n\nWindows Home Server 2011 (an edition of Windows Server 2008 R2)\n\nHyper-V Server (a discontinued,[22] freeware edition of Windows Server 2008 through 2019)[23]\n\nWindows MultiPoint Server\n\nWindows Server Essentials[24][25]\n\nWindows Essential Business Server (discontinued)[26]\n\nAzure Stack HCI (an edition of Windows Server 2019 and later)[27]\n\nFollowing the release of Windows Server 2016, Microsoft attempted to mirror the lifecycle of Windows 10 in the Windows Server family, releasing new versions twice a year which were supported for 18 months. These semi-annual versions were only available as part of Microsoft subscription services, including Software Assurance, Azure Marketplace, and Visual Studio subscriptions,[28] until their discontinuation in July 2021.[29][28]\n\nThe semi-annual releases do not include any desktop environments. Instead, they are restricted to the Nano Server configuration installed in a Docker container,[16][28] and the Server Core configuration, licensed only to serve as a container host.[16][28]\n\nSemi-Annual releases include:[30]\n\nWindows Server, version 1709 (unsupported as of April 9, 2019; 5 years ago (2019-04-09))\n\nWindows Server, version 1803 (unsupported as of November 12, 2019; 4 years ago (2019-11-12))\n\nWindows Server, version 1809 (unsupported as of November 10, 2020; 3 years ago (2020-11-10))\n\nWindows Server, version 1903 (unsupported as of December 8, 2020; 3 years ago (2020-12-08))\n\nWindows Server, version 1909 (unsupported as of May 11, 2021; 3 years ago (2021-05-11))\n\nWindows Server, version 2004 (unsupported as of December 14, 2021; 2 years ago (2021-12-14))\n\nWindows Server, version 20H2 (unsupported as of August 9, 2022; 2 years ago (2022-08-09))[31][32][33][34]\n\nAnnual releases\n\nThe Annual Channel was first announced on July 2023, with the first version being released on September the same year. Unlike the Semi-Annual releases, each Annual Channel release would receive six months of extended support in addition to the 18 months of regular support. Annual releases are made available every twelve months, hence the name. Datacenter is the only edition available.\n\nAnnual releases include:[35]\n\nWindows Server, version 23H2\n\nUpcoming releases\n\nUpcoming releases include:\n\nWindows Server 2025[36][37]\n\nSee also\n\nList of Microsoft Windows versions\n\nMicrosoft Servers\n\nLinux range of use § Servers, mainframes and supercomputers\n\nNetWare\n\nOpen Enterprise Server\n\nReferences"
