Windows Server 2003 is a major release of Windows Server released on 24 April 2003. It is the server counterpart of Windows XP, although it was released nearly 18 months after its original release and is built on a slightly newer codebase (kernel version 5.2 rather than 5.1). It was released in several editions, including Web Edition, Standard Edition, Datacenter Edition and Enterprise Edition. It replaces Windows 2000 Server and was eventually succeeded by Windows Server 2008.

A major update called Windows Server 2003 R2 was released on 6 December 2005, although unlike server versions with the R2 moniker that were in fact based on newer Windows versions, it was still built on the same codebase as the original version. The update included .NET Framework 2.0, Microsoft Management Console 3.0, Virtual Server 2005 and Windows Services for UNIX.

Several other products were built on the codebase of Windows Server 2003, such as the updated version of Windows XP 64-Bit Edition, Windows XP Professional x64 Edition, Windows Small Business Server 2003 and Windows Home Server.

Release 2[edit | edit source]

An interim release under the name of Windows Server 2003 R2 was released to manufacturing on 6 December 2005.[3] New features compared to the original release are .NET Framework 2.0, Microsoft Management Console 3.0 (including new snap-ins), Microsoft Virtual Server 2005 and Windows Services for UNIX.

Other versions[edit | edit source]

As well as the standard Windows Server 2003, several other editions were built on the NT 5.2 kernel, including Storage Server 2003 (released on 10 September 2003),[4] Storage Server 2003 R2 (released on 6 March 2006), Compute Cluster Server 2003 (released on 9 June 2006), Small Business Server 2003 R2 (released on 1 September 2006) and Unified Data Storage Server 2003 (released on 5 December 2006).

Startup sound[edit | edit source]

There is a widespread misconception that a version of Windows Server 2003 for the United Kingdom used a different startup sound. However, all versions and localizations of Windows Server 2003 use the same startup sound as in Windows XP â€“ furthermore, Windows was not available in an English (United Kingdom) variant until Windows 8 and Windows Server 2012.

Source code leak[edit | edit source]

On 23 September 2020, the source code for Windows XP Service Pack 1 and Windows Server 2003's RTM build was shared on 4chan's /g/ board. As mentioned on the original post, the code had been circulating in private circles for several years at most. Due to the incompleteness of both source code repositories, primarily within the activation functionalities, it is fair to assume that the disclosure had originated from a Microsoft Partner who had access to the source code rather than Microsoft themselves. The ability to glance into the groundwork of this operating system has led to some discoveries, an example being the checks for enabling the DirectUI-based Start Page from shell\explorer\tray.cpp being usable in build 2410.

System requirements[edit | edit source]

Windows Server 2003 requires a processor with a speed of at least 550 MHz, at least 256 MB of RAM, 1.5 GB of hard drive space, a CD-ROM drive, and a Super VGA or better display adapter.
