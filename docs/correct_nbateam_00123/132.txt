The Golden State Warriors have been busy during NBA Free Agency, re-signing Kevin Durant, Stephen Curry, Andre Iguodala and Shaun Livingston. And the Warriors aren't done yet, as they've emerged as front runners for Jamal Crawford.

In addition to their interest in Nick Young, ESPN reports the Warriors are also front-runners for Jamal Crawford. The signing of Crawford is contingent upon the Atlanta Hawks buying out Crawford if/when the Clippers complete their sign-and-trade for Danilo Gallinari.

"Sources informed ESPN that Crawford would seek an immediate buyout and the Warriors would be the front-runners for his services if they still possessed the taxpayer midlevel exception of $5.2 million," Chris Haynes writes.

Crawford played for the Warriors in 2008-09. He reportedly loved his time there and is close with Kevin Durant.

The former sixth man of the year is not the same player he once was. The 37-year-old averaged 12.3 points last year and hit 36 percent of his 3-pointers.
