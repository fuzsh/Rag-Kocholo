From the 2012-13 season through the 2016-17 campaign, Jamal Crawford was a member of the Los Angeles Clippers.

During that span, the Clippers made the playoffs each seasons, but never reached the Western Conference Finals.

Crawford sat down with Marcus Thompson of The Athletic to explain why the Warriors broke through and the Clippers did not.

“The Warriors weren’t only the best team, but they were the best team (emphasizing their cohesiveness and chemistry),” Crawford told Thompson. “They never splintered. They stayed together. They handled the moment. You gotta have that. When adversity hits, it doesn’t build character, it reveals it. We didn’t handle it well. And then, at the wrong time, we had injuries. So some of it was self-inflicted, some of it was bad luck.

“In that five years I was there, we won the third or fourth most games. We were right there in a lot of different ways, and in some ways we weren’t.”

He also reminisced on his brief stay in the Bay Area

“This was the first place I played in the NBA where the sun woke me up,” Crawford said. “I used to always go to the Burrito Shop. Go hang out in Jack London Square at the Barnes & Noble. Get some chicken and waffles.

“One thing about here, the fans give it up. I can honestly say they’re not bandwagon fans. We weren’t good that season and they represented.”

Crawford suited up for Golden State during the 2008-09 season. He appeared in 54 games, averaging 19.7 points and 4.4 assists.
