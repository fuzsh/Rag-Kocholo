        "text": "Los Angeles >> The Los Angeles Clippers beat the Warriors in a heated, grind-it-out game with the nation watching right along with the two tall spectators on the Golden State bench.\n\nAndrew Bogut was on the sideline wearing a suit as was Festus Ezeli due to the team’s top two centers having gone down with injuries. Sound familiar?\n\nShorthanded on Christmas, the Warriors lost 100-86 as they were handed their worst loss of the season on Thursday. Without their big men, they fell to both Los Angeles teams at Staples Center in the span of three days.\n\nJamal Crawford came off the bench to score a game-high 24 points, and Chris Paul added 22 after a slow first half to carry the Clippers, as the Warriors began to see the absence of strong post play take its toll.\n\nKlay Thompson scored 15, and Stephen Curry added 14 as they combined to shoot 3 for 15 from 3-point range and had no other answers.\n\nThe 23-5 Warriors maintain the best record in the NBA after two straight losses, but the loss of Ezeli for the game due to a sprained ankle could be felt as the Clippers took charge in the second half.\n\nThe good news for the Warriors was that coach Steve Kerr seemed optimistic Bogut (knee) could return sooner than later and begin working out on the court in the next few days.\n\nUnfortunately for the team, the offense has been thrown out of whack. It could be seen as the Warriors committed 20 turnovers against the Lakers on Tuesday in a 115-105 loss. They were sloppy against the Clippers as well, as Curry had five of the Warriors’ 16 turnovers.\n\nThe Warriors trailed 73-70 heading into in the fourth quarter after Paul drove past Justin Holiday for a layup with one tenth of a second left in the third. The Clippers then broke the game open with a 13-2 run.\n\nThe Warriors had led 42-41 at halftime after going up by as many 11 points, as the Clippers scored the last nine points of the second quarter while Curry sat for most of that stretch with two fouls.\n\nThe Warriors spoiled an opportunity to take advantage of the cold-shooting Clippers’ start. After DeAndre Jordan dunked on the game’s opening play, no Clippers starter made a field goal for the rest of the quarter.\n\nGriffin (2 for 10), Paul (2 for 7), JJ Redick (1 for 6) and Matt Barnes (0 for 3) clanked their shots in the first half, as the Clippers relied on Crawford’s 10 first-quarter points to stay in the game.\n\nGriffin with Draymond Green draped all over him on defense missed his first eight field goal attempts.\n\nBut while the Clippers made three of their first 17 shots from 3-point range, the Warriors were 3 for 13 to start from long distance while also committing eight first-half turnovers.\n\nIn the third quarter, the Clippers took advantage of a Curry turnover to have Jordan dunk off a reverse alley-oop to take a 61-59 lead. Paul then scored on a 3-point play, as Curry picked up his third foul, before the Clippers guard hit a 3-pointer, giving the Clippers a 67-61 lead.\n\n• Ezeli is scheduled to undergo an MRI exam Friday on his injured ankle after X rays were negative.\n\n“Ankle’s really swollen,” Ezeli said. “I thought that I was going to have a chance to just push through it and play today. It’s kind of weird for me to be sitting out with an ankle sprain. I’ve never thought of that as a real injury, but it’s hard for me to even walk.”"
