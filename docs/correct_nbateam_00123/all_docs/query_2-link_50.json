        "text": "Right before the NBA Playoffs began, 20-year league veteran Jamal Crawford dove into the online perception of 14-time All-Star Kevin Durant in an exclusive interview with Mirror Sports U.S.\n\nAccording to Crawford, a championship with the Phoenix Suns would have significantly altered Durant's narrative within basketball's hallowed grounds for important discussion: NBA Twitter (aka X). Few figures evoke as much emotional discourse in sports, specifically on NBA Twitter, as Durant. Whether he's driving to the basket, sinking a contested jumper over a smaller defender, or firing off a tweet, Durant perennially finds himself between the realms of admiration and antipathy, prompting social media, players, and analysts to wrestle with the enigma of his persona.\n\nIn an appearance on Scoop B Radio, former NBA coach George Karl criticized Durant for what he termed \"weird decisions\" in his career trajectory. Karl highlighted Durant's departure from the Oklahoma City Thunder in 2016 to join the Golden State Warriors, where he won two championships in three seasons. Durant then moved to the Brooklyn Nets, where he spent four years before joining the Suns last season.\n\nREAD MORE: EXCLUSIVE: Greg Anthony's list of NBA Playoff teams with closing title windows in grave danger\n\nREAD MORE: Anthony Edwards makes a beeline for Kevin Durant after Timberwolves record historic sweep over Suns\n\nDurant's engagements on social media include past controversies surrounding burner accounts, clapbacks, feuds with players and media personalities, and more. But the online interactions and controversy have made him an entertaining follow, evidenced by his 20.9 million followers on the platform and over 13.4 million on Instagram.\n\n\"I think for the masses, when I see on social I think Kevin Durant,\" said Crawford when asked which player could change their online perception this postseason. \"I think Kevin Durant winning, you'll look at him in a totally different light than anybody because he gets so much crap for the championships.\n\n\"He won Golden State even though he was the finals MVP in both those championships. That's just a narrative out there. So if he wins a championship in Phoenix, obviously being a top dog there. If they want it, I think he would change his legacy more than anybody else winning a championship.\"\n\nClick here to follow the Mirror US on Google News to stay up to date with all the latest news, sport and entertainment stories.\n\nThe Suns were abruptly swept by the Minnesota Timberwolves in the first round of the playoffs. Despite Phoenix's challenging efforts, Durant averaged 26.8 points per game and a 42 percent success rate from beyond the arc throughout the series. The four-time scoring champion displayed remarkable consistency across the series, tallying 31 points in Game 1, 18 in Game 2, 25 in Game 3, and 33 in Game 4. Despite his offensive brilliance, the Suns ultimately fell short in their postseason campaign.\n\nDevin Booker led the Suns in scoring for the series with 27.5 points, closely followed by Durant. Despite Bradley Beal's offensive drop-off, contributing 16.5 points per game, they were the only players to average more than 9 points in the series.\n\nIn the aftermath of the sweep, NBA analysts have been abuzz with rumors of internal turmoil within the team, with speculation swirling around the possible firing of head coach Frank Vogel. However, NBA legend turned analyst Charles Barkley vehemently disputed the notion that Vogel carried sole responsibility for the team's struggles in a passionate rant on TNT after the closeout game.\n\nRumblings within online NBA circles suggested that Durant may be growing apart with his role as a power forward in today's league. With teams increasingly adopting the strategy of pairing a shooting big man at center alongside a versatile defender at power forward, Durant's fit within this framework has come under scrutiny."
