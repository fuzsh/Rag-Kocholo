        "text": "Warriors F Al Harrington has been traded to the New York Knicks for G Jamal Crawford.\n\nThis trade clearly helps the Warriors a lot more than the lousy Knicks.\n\nJamal Crawford is currently leading the league in three-pointers this season and has fit extremely well into D'Antoni's offensive system. He is playing just like the Phoenix Suns did last year.\n\nCrawford will now play alongside Monta Ellis (when he returns from injury), Corey Maggette, Andris Biedrins, Stephen Jackson, and Anthony Morrow. As of right now, I can see Crawford starting at the point guard position and running the team like he did in Chicago.\n\nThe Knicks are digging themselves into a deeper hole with Harrington's contract. They will have to pay him $9.2 million just this season and another $10 million next season, with his contract expiring in the 09-10 season. What is the point of this trade?\n\nBreakdown\n\nThe Warriors have a fast-paced, three-point shooting team with solid defense. Stephen Jackson is the captain of the team and a key to their success as he teaches his team how to win games and make it to the playoffs. Biedrins is having a career season, averaging a league-high 14.3 rebounds per game (more than Dwight Howard).\n\nAnthony Morrow has started in two games this season and has scored a combined 62 points in both games. Maggette, who recently returned from injury, is starting to play his game in Golden State, and you can expect the Warriors to make a nice run for the playoffs this season!\n\nOverview\n\nThe Knicks gave away their best offensive weapon for a power forward with a big price tag that expires in two seasons. They already have Zach Randolph and David Lee playing the power forward position, and I believe this is just another trade that the Knicks will regret in the seasons to come."
