Young, old, good or bad at the game, we all have some basketball story, from the playgrounds all the way to the professional level. Even in prison you can find people connecting over one of the few sports allowed in that environment. With that in mind remember that basketball and sports in general has became a huge business as the years went by, and will only continue to grow now that players from all over are starting to pay attention and catch up. With the NBA in particular wanting to grow and expand its reach internationally, international players became very important to their brand’s future. But one person specifically possessed a chance to be the biggest basketball player ever when you mix basketball connecting people and business together, and that was Yao Ming. What made him special was a few things. Obviously we have to start with how talented he was, much of it having to do with his size as a human period, where not many people in general ever reach 7’6 inches tall. He was an all star the next 6 years, missed a year due to injury, and came back for just 5 games his final NBA season and was voted an all star again in 2011, solely because of his home country China his their fan vote to cast on their hometown hero. With the talent, unique size, charisma and perfect timing, Yao Ming could’ve been the biggest basketball player ever if not for these reasons. YAO MING Could’ve Been The Biggest Basketball Player Ever! Stunted Growth OUT NOW!!
