        "text": "PLAYA VISTA – They have followed each other’s careers from high school to college to the pros. They’ve competed against each other, in some cases guarding each other.\n\nBut Grant Hill, Jamal Crawford and Lamar Odom had never put on the same team’s jersey at the same time.\n\n“When you have this type of talent, it’s almost like you can’t let opportunities like this slip by,” Crawford said. “You can’t let an opportunity like that get away from you. You have to take advantage of the moment.”\n\nAnd at this moment, largely because of these three veterans, the Clippers are one of the deepest teams in the NBA.\n\n“We’re one of those elite benches, without a doubt,” Crawford said. “Maybe, we’re No. 1. That remains to be seen.”\n\nTHE SELL\n\nThe Clippers founded and colonized Lob City after striking a deal for Chris Paul less than two weeks before the start of the 2011-12 season, and while the trade instantly legitimized the franchise, it also forced the team to scramble.\n\nIn a blink, the Clippers had to recalculate, adding veteran Reggie Evans late in free agency. The team signed Kenyon Martin when he returned from China and acquired Nick Young at the NBA’s trade deadline to bolster the bench.\n\nWhile those three played pivotal roles in the Clippers’ first-round playoff victory over the Memphis Grizzlies, Coach Vinny Del Negro and the front office didn’t think it would last.\n\n“It wasn’t the chemistry (we wanted) and the direction we felt was sustainable,” Del Negro said.\n\nSo the Clippers rebuilt their bench. The team swapped Mo Williams for Odom and signed Crawford and Hill. The Clippers also traded for shooting guard Willie Green and added free agents Matt Barnes, Ryan Hollins and Ronny Turiaf.\n\nIn adding such a large number of players used to being contributors, Del Negro knew he was maybe also adding some headaches in the future.\n\n“Everything from Day One has been explained before they signed, their roles and what their jobs were going to be,” he said. “But from that standpoint, sometimes, it’s going to be tough. You can only play so many guys.”\n\nBut it’s not just the veterans in the second unit who could see their minutes go down. The Clippers’ starters might have to give way some as well.\n\n“Their minutes could come down, too, but everyone has bought in,” Hill said. “Everyone wants to be successful and wants to be a part of a winning team. Winning allows for that to happen. If we can win and win and win, it’ll be easier for people to make that sacrifice.”\n\nAnd as of now, Odom, Crawford and Hill are more than willing to sit if they have to.\n\n“You have to sacrifice,” Crawford said. “When you have that, it’s a good thing because guys are competitive and want to play. But also, the guys they brought in understand that sometimes, it’s not going to be my night.\n\n“Some nights, I’m not going to play as many minutes as I probably should, but if it’s about team, it’s what it’s about.“\n\nFIRST IMPRESSION\n\nBefore the Clippers practiced this fall, the veteran guys all knew this had the chance to be a special season.\n\nBut once Hill, Odom and Crawford started to play together, that excitement grew.\n\n“It’s amazing. On paper this summer, you’re like ‘Wow. We have a chance to have some really good depth,'” said Hill, who will miss time to start the season with a bone bruise in his right knee. “But when you bring it all together and go through practice, it’s even exceeded my expectations as to how good we can be.”\n\nDespite never playing together, Odom said playing with Crawford and Hill has been “easy” since the first practice of the year.\n\n“It was just playing basketball in its natural essence,” Odom said. “It was like going to the park and playing with guys you might know in the neighborhood, but you’d never played with them before. It was fairly easy, and it was fun.”\n\nSeeing the Clippers’ transformation from calamity to contender also has Odom ready to revitalize his career after a disastrous season in Dallas.\n\nThat change started when the Clippers traded for Paul, but when they added Crawford, Hill and other vets, Odom was convinced it was for real.\n\n“It was exciting, and it was invigorating. This is a place where tradition has changed,” said Odom, who played his first four seasons with the Clippers from 1999 to 2003. “It used to be a place where this didn’t happen. People didn’t want to be here voluntarily.\n\n“I think it’s one of the things we’ve witnessed happen is the tradition changing. To be a part of the new tradition and the changing, it’s cool.”\n\nEND GAME\n\nIt’s one thing assembling a bench with former stars such as Hill, Crawford and Odom. It’s another thing to turn all that talent into victories and to turn those victories into a championship.\n\nFor that to happen, Hill said, the Clippers’ starters and bench players need to become a singular unit, one that knows everyone’s preferences, tendencies and weaknesses.\n\n“Until then, we can still win and be successful,” Hill said. “We’re talented enough. In terms of reaching our potential, I don’t what the number of games is, but it takes time.\n\n“That second level is what’s necessary to have success in the postseason. It takes time, but I think we can still be a top team in the league, if not the top team in the league, at the start of the season.”\n\nIf they get there, it’ll be because Paul and Blake Griffin are superstars. But it’ll also be because Crawford, Odom and Hill came up big off the bench.\n\n“You have to buy in to the fact that it’s about team and not about you,” Crawford said. “If it’s about you, you can be upset. I’ve averaged 20 points in this league, but if you’re truly, truly about winning, then it’s not about any of that. You do what you have to do.\n\n“We all have a role and we all understand that.”"
