        "text": "Golden State coach Steve Kerr is a happy man these days.\n\nHe's got a new contract. He's got his son Nick, who was helping out in San Antonio, working in the Warriors' video room now. He's leading a team that has won three of the last four NBA championships and is the overwhelming favorite to win it again this season.\n\nStaying happy will be the challenge for Kerr and the Warriors this season, when Western Conference rivals resume their attempts to take down the champs.\n\n\"Our place in the history of the league is pretty secure,\" Kerr said. \"I don't think our guys should feel a ton of pressure. I think they should feel the importance of trying to do it again, because this may be the last time we have this current iteration of the Warriors, just given all the free agents and the money crunch and everything else.\"\n\nLeBron James took his talents to Los Angeles, signing with the Lakers and moving out of the East for the first time in his career. Houston had the NBA's best regular-season record a year ago and has reigning MVP James Harden. Utah has a budding superstar in Donovan Mitchell, and certainly got the league's attention with its playoff run last season.\n\nBut in the West, until further notice, it's still the Warriors and then everybody else.\n\n\"It's a marathon,\" Warriors guard Stephen Curry said. \"There's a lot of time between now and April and May and June, but if we go about it the right way to start the season, it can feed on itself in terms of the expectation we have night in, night out.\"\n\nA look at the West, in predicted order of finish:\n\nPLAYOFF BOUND\n\n1. GOLDEN STATE — Warriors aiming for their third consecutive NBA championship, something only the Lakers, Celtics and Bulls franchises have done.\n\n2. UTAH — Donovan Mitchell is a legitimate star, coach Quin Snyder has been underrated for far too long, and the Jazz went 29-6 to finish last season.\n\n3. HOUSTON — The Rockets have the MVP in James Harden, a leader in Chris Paul and added Carmelo Anthony, but expecting another 67-15 season is a lot.\n\n4. L.A. LAKERS — LeBron James is still the best player in the game and shows no signs of slowing down, so doubting his chances seems less than brilliant.\n\n5. OKLAHOMA CITY — This is a sign of how loaded the West remains: The Thunder are really good, and that won't assure them home-court for Round 1.\n\n6. DENVER — Losing Game 82 last season to Minnesota and missing the playoffs because of that outcome should serve as a massive motivator for Denver.\n\n7. NEW ORLEANS — DeMarcus Cousins is gone, Rajon Rondo is gone, but Anthony Davis is still there and that should be enough for a Pelicans playoff run.\n\n8. SAN ANTONIO — Dejounte Murray's ACL tear is a disaster, but any team with LaMarcus Aldridge, DeMar DeRozan and Gregg Popovich still has a lot.\n\nIN THE MIX\n\n9. PORTLAND — The West's No. 3 seed last season, the Blazers were only three games ahead of No. 9 and will face a serious battle in a very loaded West.\n\n10. DALLAS — Luka Doncic is NBA-ready, DeAndre Jordan will make the Mavs better and Dirk Nowitzki deserves to see his franchise trending up again.\n\n11. L.A. CLIPPERS — A possible transitional year for the Clippers, who should be major players in free agency next summer and could add a lottery pick.\n\nFACING LONG ODDS\n\n12. MINNESOTA — The Jimmy Butler debacle shows that some big changes in direction are probably going to happen in Minnesota, and sooner than later.\n\n13. PHOENIX — Devin Booker got his max deal and the Suns got No. 1 pick Deandre Ayton, but firing GM Ryan McDonough so close to the season was odd.\n\n14. MEMPHIS — Mike Conley and Marc Gasol are savvy vets, but they are going to need a lot of help if Memphis is going to seriously improve this season.\n\n15. SACRAMENTO — Kings had a league-high 44 games last season where they didn't score 100 points, and a very young team might not change that much.\n\nWHAT TO KNOW\n\nL.A. BRON: If he has even an average-for-him season, new Los Angeles Lakers star LeBron James will rise to No. 4 on the NBA's all-time scoring list this season. He's currently No. 7, with No. 6 Dirk Nowitzki, No. 5 Wilt Chamberlain and No. 4 Michael Jordan well within reach. Add 2,000 or so points to James' total of 31,038, and only No. 3 Kobe Bryant, No. 2 Karl Malone and No. 1 Kareem Abdul-Jabbar — all former Lakers — would still be ahead of him.\n\nSTEPH RISING: Speaking of rising up career charts, Golden State's Stephen Curry could easily be No. 3 on the all-time list for 3-pointers made by the end of this season. Curry has 2,129 3s in 625 career games, a rate of 3.4 made per game. The six players ahead of him — Ray Allen, Reggie Miller, Jason Terry, Kyle Korver, Jamal Crawford and Paul Pierce — averaged 1.8 made 3s per game.\n\nBIG NUMBERS: The only players in the last 30 seasons to average 30 points and eight assists were Oklahoma City's Russell Westbrook in 2016-17 and Houston's James Harden last season. Probably not coincidentally, Westbrook and Harden won MVP awards for those seasons. There are seven active players with at least one MVP award in the NBA right now, and all seven play in the West.\n\nGREAT COACHES: San Antonio's Gregg Popovich enters the season with 1,197 wins, fifth-most in NBA history — 13 behind Pat Riley and 24 behind Jerry Sloan. Meanwhile, Golden State's Steve Kerr comes into the year with the highest winning percentages during both the regular season (265-63, .808) and the postseason (63-20, .759) in NBA history. Here's how far ahead Kerr is on the NBA's all-time regular season winning percentage list: If the Warriors go 24-58 this season, which seems less than likely, he would still be above Phil Jackson for the No. 1 spot.\n\nVERSUS EAST: The West beat the East for the ninth consecutive season in head-to-head matchups, winning nearly 53 percent of the cross-conference matchups in the regular season (and 100 percent of them in the NBA Finals). Over the last nine seasons, West teams have beaten East teams nearly 57 percent of the time.\n\n———"
