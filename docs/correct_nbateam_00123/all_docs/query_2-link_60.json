        "text": "The NBA season is back in full swing.\n\nThe main question is who's going to stop the Warriors or the West's dominance over the East?\n\nSome believe that LeBron James joining the Lakers makes the East's amount of superstar talent paltry and obsolete.\n\nOthers might wonder if the Suns have any chance to compete in the Pacific division with a team that recently ousted GM Ryan McDonough spent five years rebuilding.\n\nHere's a look at the story lines for each team:\n\nWest Conference\n\nHouston Rockets\n\nThe addition of Carmelo Anthony off the bench could be a net positive for the league's second-best offense forcing defenses to pick their lesser evils to either stop Houston's off-ball threats and volume shooting from beyond the arc, James Harden's killer isolation scoring, and Chris Paul's pick-and-roll penetration ending in high percentage alley-oops to their pivot players men Clint Capela, James Ennis and Clint Capela.\n\nGolden State Warriors\n\nThe NBA's gold standard has five future Hall of Famers and deep bench that can maintain their unstoppable transition pace and unselfish ball movement on offense, and they remain just steps to perfection as they pursue a fourth NBA title.\n\nPortland Trail Blazers\n\nC.J. McCollum and Damian Lillard have big chips on their shoulders and a lot to prove after Kevin Durant derisively told McCollum on his own podcast that Portland will never win a title, Lillard vehemently diffused rumors during the summer about wanting to be traded, and being swept by the No. 6 seed Pelicans in last season's playoffs.\n\nOklahoma City Thunder\n\nThe Thunder roster is no longer in flux as the team will build around perennial All-Star Paul George and Russell Westbrook's triple-double average. Expect big contributions from forward Jerami Grant and Patrick Patterson with their roster thin at the four spot, and double-double production from one of the league's best big men in Steven Adams, plus additional scoring from their new backup point guard Dennis Shroeder.\n\nUtah Jazz\n\nThe Jazz were the league's second-best defense and can no longer be considered a surprise team with its young core of future All-Star and Rookie of the Year runner-up Donovan Mitchell, the effective penetration and flash from point guard Ricky Rubio, the ever-needed spark of leaper Dante Exum, Jae Crowder's blue-collar grit and hustle for their team identity, highly efficient and streaky shooting from stretch four Joe Ingles, and reigning Defensive Player of the Year Rudy Gobert to create the intimidation factor in the post with Derrick Favors.\n\nNew Orleans Pelicans\n\nLosing DeMarcus Cousins to injury last season and him walk to Golden State is an addition by subtraction by freeing up the MVP-caliber production from Anthony Davis, but their missing link is a consummate swingman to the Pelicans' depth issue. Jrue Holiday's is one of the best guards in the league and with a little consistency from 6-10 stretch forward Nikola Mirotic and stellar role play from center Julius Randle could make them hard to beat.\n\nSan Antonio Spurs\n\nThis will be the most interesting season in Gregg Popopvich's 20-plus years as the Spurs head coach as he re-establishes the team-first mentality with All-Star newcomer DeMar DeRozan and the composite of Rudy Gay, LaMarcus Aldridge, Pau Gasol, and Patty Mills to not make this into a rebuilding season.\n\nMinnesota Timberwolves\n\nIf the Jimmy Butler saga continues into this season without a viable trade partner to ship him out of town, it could be hard for their young stars Karl Anthony-Towns and Andrew Wiggins to assert and share their leadership roles, and could cause the Timberwolves to revert back to their all-too-familiar identity as a lottery team.\n\nDenver Nuggets\n\nThe Nuggets have a young talented core with shooting guard Jamal Murray, forwards Will Barton and Gary Harris and one of the NBA's best play-making big men in Nikola Jokic to set them and himself up for more points per possession, along with the impact of Isaiah Thomas and four-time All Star Paul Millsap could get them closer to the 50-win mark and compete stronger for a playoff spot in the oversaturated West.\n\nLos Angeles Clippers\n\nHead coach Doc Rivers will look to reigning Sixth Man of the Year Lou Williams as his best offensive weapon to carry the bulk of the scoring with Tobias Harris, Milos Teodosic, and the ardent work ethic of Luc Mbah a Moute. Marcin Gortat will occupy the the low post as the Clippers deal with their frontcourt issues in the post-Lob City era.\n\nLos Angeles Lakers\n\nLeBron James in Tinseltown single-handedly reinvigorates the Lake Show glitz of yore, and it will also be an important bullet point on his Hall of Fame resume if the 16-year veteran can turnaround the team whose roster's average age is 25 and missed five consecutive playoff appearances gets a 15-to-20 game increase in win differential.\n\nSacramento Kings\n\nThe Kings have currently have the league's longest playoff drought at 12 seasons, but they are littered with young talent with assets such as point guards De'Aaron Fox, Yogi Ferrell and Frank Mason III, the mid-range game and inside presence of Marvin Bagley III and Justin Jackson. Buddy Hield will provide some streaky perimeter shooting while Sacramento gets its rim protection and second-chance points from center Willie Cauley-Stein.\n\nDallas Mavericks\n\nRookie point guard and No. 3 overall draft pick Luka Doncic's experience as a seasoned professional European player and energetic play-maker brings even more urgency with explosive second-year point guard Dennis Smith, Jr., DeAndre Jordan will continue to live above, while Dallas tries to balance its team chemistry with veteran leadership from Mavericks lifers J.J. Barea and Dirk Nowitzki.\n\nMemphis Grizzlies\n\nGrizzlies first-round draft pick Jaren Jackson is a product of Michigan State coach Tom Izzo's defensive school of thought that's bred impactful players such as Draymond Green and Zach Randolph, and if he brings his scoring prowess to help aging veterans Mike Conley and Mac Gasol with role players like Shelvin Mack and Kyle Anderson, then they could get out of the Southwest Division's basement.\n\nPhoenix Suns\n\nThe Suns have a completely new look in their roster with multiple veterans including power forwards Trevor Ariza and Ryan Anderson, the No. 1 overall draft pick Deandre Ayton to build around as well as forwards Josh Jackson and Mikal Bridges. Jamal Crawford and Frenchman Elie Okobo as plugs at point guard can free up franchise star Devin Booker to move to his natural shooting guard position, but Dragan Bender needs to prove his value immediately, and T.J. Warren needs to help their desperate rebounding needs without just being a good scorer.\n\nEastern Conference\n\nToronto Raptors\n\nThe Raptors are doing a 180 from their post-DeMar Derozan era and Dwayne Casey system to incorporate the league's best two-way player in Kawhi Leonard, one of the league's best shooters in Danny Green and the high assist-to-turnover ratio of sixth man Fred Van Fleet, and franchise star Kyle Lowry to possibly go deeper in the playoffs now that LeBron James won't eliminate them for the fourth consecutive year.\n\nBoston Celtics\n\nThe Celtics are the team to beat and expected to come out of the East with limitless options such as Jayson Tatum, Jaylen Brown, point guard Terry Rozier, and Al Horford in the middle, but Kyrie Irving and Gordon Hayward both returning from injuries to the lineup will require major adjustments in finding ways to share the ball and scale back some of the other players' contributions into role players in coach Brad Stevens' system.\n\nPhiladelphia 76ers\n\nThe Sixers are the only other team besides the Raptors who could beat the Celtics in the East, but Markelle Fultz will need to stay healthy and make an immediate impact as a top-rated plus/minus sixth man backing up Ben Simmons at the one, along with multi-talented frontcourt players Dario Saric and Joel Embiid creating their own shots and making defenses decide to double down on them or close out on spot-up three-point specialists Robert Covington and J.J. Redick for \"the process\" to work.\n\nCleveland Cavaliers\n\nKevin Love will be the Cavaliers' go-to guy like his days in Minnesota, and Tyronn Lue has the chance to creatively change the LeBron-less offense and build a formidable defense with Tristan Thompson and Larry Nance Jr. to challenge shots, keep superb volume shooting from George Hill, Rodney Hood and rookie Collin Sexton, and J.R. Smith leading with consistency and a higher basketball IQ.\n\nIndiana Pacers\n\nHaving the league's Most Improved Player in Victor Oladipo, Tyreke Evans at the top of his game, and interchangeable big Domantas Sabonis with Myles Turner on the blocks shows they have potential to be more than a sleeper team in the wide open East, especially after they put the Cavaliers on their heels during last season's playoffs.\n\nMiami Heat\n\nHassan Whiteside's and Dion Waiters places in the team's future are questionable, if All-Star point guard Goran Dragic can get his assist-to-turnover ratio higher and feed the team's future franchise star Bam Adebayo in the post. The Heat will have to utilize the effective three-point shooting from center Kelly Olyknk, slasher Justice Winslow to play off the ball and blossoming guard Josh Richardson to end up higher than a sixth seed in Dwyane Wade's farewell season.\n\nMilwaukee Bucks\n\nGiannis Antetokounmpo will get more MVP votes this year but his supporting cast consisting of Eric Bledsoe as their primary ball-handler, former Rookie of the Year Malcolm Brogdon and Khris Middleton rising to the call as their third and fourth-best options. Thon Maker is underrated and making a case as a second-tier NBA big man which could foster a winning culture this season in new coach Mike Budenholzer's selfless Popovich-style system.\n\nWashington Wizards\n\nJohn Wall and Bradley Beal will need to co-exist again as one of the best backcourts in the league. Dwight Howard could be an asset for their defensive presence in the middle or a thorn in their side of their offense that slows down the ball movement while trying to get Otto Porter Jr., Markief Morris, and Kelly Oubre involved as much as possible.\n\nOrlando Magic\n\nAaron Gordon is team's outright best player but he needs a better supporting cast aside from center Nikola Vucevic and Evan Fournier on the perimeter to handle the team's workload on offense and defense. That means their young inside players Mo Bamba and Jonathan Isaac will have to play a lot of minutes, become more aggressive and put on much more muscle for the Magic to compete for a playoff spot.\n\nDetroit Pistons\n\nNew head coach Dwyane Casey was brought in to clean up the mess that Stan Van Gundy couldn't get right after five seasons. He could make Andre Drummond and Blake Griffin into the best frontcourt in the East but Reggie Jackson must prove that he's a high-octane point guard who is worth his $17 million-dollar cap hit this season.\n\nCharlotte Hornets\n\nNew general manager Mitch Kupchak was brought in by owner Michael Jordan to revamp a team desperately in need of distancing itself from a load of bad contracts. New head coach James Borrego reflects some of his experience as part of Gregg Popovich's successful NBA coaching tree. But they'll have to rely on Tony Parker and Malik Monk as a true offensive threats to the take the weight off of Kemba Walker as their primary scorer.\n\nNew York Knicks\n\nThere is only one way but up to have the return of Kristaps Porzingis from last year's season-ending knee injury to finally become the transcendent player that Knicks fans have been holding their breath three years for, make rookies Kevin Knox and Allonzo Trier their best offensive options, and have key players like point guard Frank Ntilikina, Tim Hardaway and Trey Burke turn into the best show on Broadway this decade.\n\nChicago Bulls\n\nLots of great talent and athleticism on paper in Zach LaVine, Kris Dunn, and incoming Chicago native Jabari Parker, but their health is the biggest issue with the team trying to find their feet. Bobby Portis, Lauri Markannen and rookie Wendell Carter, Jr — who each have tremendous upside as the team's future core players — and Denzel Valentine will try to become more consistent on offense and their best defender.\n\nBrooklyn Nets\n\nNets coach Kenny Atkinson seems to be making the right moves to increase the team's potential year-over-year inching them closer to becoming a .500 team because they finally have their own draft pick. Brooklyn does have emerging players Caris Levert, workhorse center Jarrett Allen, Rondae Hollis-Jefferson, and a sound backcourt in D'Angelo Russell and Spencer Dinwiddie.\n\nAtlanta Hawks\n\nThe rebuilding process continues with a handful of rookies including big men Kevin Huerter and Omari Spellman, and speedy volume-shooting point guard Trae Young who needs mentorship from veteran backcourt teammate Jeremy Lin and Vince Carter to mature fast and distribute the ball to their frontcourt players John Collins and Dewayne Dedmon, plus allowing Taurean Prince to establish himself as the team's best all-around player.\n\nMORE SPORTS"
