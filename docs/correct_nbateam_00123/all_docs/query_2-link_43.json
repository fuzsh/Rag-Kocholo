        "text": "The Chicago Bulls Basketball Team was founded on January 16, 1966, and it played its first NBA season in 1966–67. Currently, the Bulls share the United Center, an arena on Chicago’s West Side, with the Chicago Blackhawks of the National Hockey League.\n\nThe 1990s saw the Bulls reach their greatest level of success and were instrumental in making the NBA well-known throughout the world. Known for a legendary dynasty, they won six NBA titles between 1991 and 1998, including two three-peats. Coach Phil Jackson led the trio of Hall of Famers Michael Jordan, Scottie Pippen, and themselves to six championship victories. Interestingly, the Bulls are the only NBA team with multiple championships and a perfect record in NBA Finals series.\n\nThe Bulls made history in the 1995–96 season when they won 72 games; that record stood until the Golden State Warriors won 73 games in 2015–16. NBA trailblazers, the Bulls were the first team to play more than 70 games in a single season, a record that was not surpassed by the Warriors in 2015–16.\n\nChicago Bulls struggled with a drop in their luck after 1998. Derrick Rose and Joakim Noah led the team to a spectacular 62-win season in 2010–11, but the club was doomed to mediocrity due to a history of injuries and significant player departures that prevented prolonged success. NBA Most Valuable Player Awards were shared by Michael Jordan and Derrick Rose during their time with the Bulls, for a combined six MVP titles.\n\nTime to explore the athletes who have defined an era for the Chicago Bulls and left an enduring impact on the world of basketball.
