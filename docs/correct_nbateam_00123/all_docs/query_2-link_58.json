        "text": "Article Length: about 2,100 words.\n\nThe “Part 3” in the title means that you’re doing yourself a disservice by not reading part 1 and part 2, but if it’s a choice between reading this one or reading none, then by all means continue on.\n\nPart 2 ended with a discussion about Klay, Durant, and Steph seamlessly blending their scoring abilities because of the particular ways (mostly floor spacing) that they all score.\n\nOn a theoretical level, this means that for a scorer to mitigate diminishing returns for other scorers on the team, they need to be an “Elite” or better “Floor Spacer” which Thompson, Durant, and Curry all are. Jordan and Pippen, the two main scorers for the Bulls, are not “Elite” floor spacers. While both were at least “Proficient” “Cutters,” you couldn’t reliably count on their spot up ability which is why they were successful with only one “Transcendent” scorer in Jordan because nobody was better at being “Ball Dominant” than he. As for the Celtics, McHale needed the rock to score since he mastered the greatest array of post moves in NBA history. On the other hand, Bird was a masterful “Cutter,” and the original “Floor Space” which allowed McHale more room to operate.\n\nOn scoring though, James Harden’s ominous claim about the Warriors that there’s “Only one basketball“ seems to somewhat miss the point. Harden is literally correct that only one person maximum can score per a single possession, but there’s so much more to a team’s offense beyond scoring. When you have players who unselfishly pass the ball, and when other teams need to seriously guard every single player on the court (unlike how teams treat Tony Allen, Andre Roberson, Joakim Noah, etc.), ball movement works to both get players open shots and tire defensive players. If you look at team passing and assist data, the Celtics followed by the Warriors led the league in total passes per game with the Warriors followed by the Celtics leading the league in assists per game. Intuitively, this points towards passing as being a skill that isn’t affected as much by diminishing returns; however, and this is an important differentiation, you need multiple “Cogs” and/or “Floor Generals” to fully take advantage of this skill. Having multiple “Dime Droppers,” players similar to Chris Paul and John Wall, can easily diminish their skills because only one player maximum can score an assist during any scoring possessions. While it may help open up the floor for another “Cog” on the court, that specific ability is less useful when grouped together than a “Cog’s” ability.\n\nThis brings us to the skillset that seems to be mostly unaffected by diminishing returns: defense. Much like scoring and passing though, not all aspects of defense can be multiplied advantageously for the team. Ultimately, this is what differentiates Draymond Green’s defense and Rudy Gobert’s defense and why Green will win DPOY later this month. Rudy Gobert is tremendous at defending the rim, but his inability to switch on defense opens him up to being bamboozled by quicker guards.\n\nDraymond defends the rim at an elite level while being able to switch onto any position in the league. This is what people mean when they say somebody can guard 1-5: the player can switch onto a player of any position and not give up a noticeable advantage. Check out this scatter plot of the fifteen players who contested the most shots per game at the rim (of players who played at least sixty games). The lower the “X” on the graph, the better the rim protector.\n\nNotice the “x” on the far right and way at the bottom? That’s Gobert, meaning that he contested the most shots at the rim per game and made the shooter miss that shot at a higher percentage (-12.8 percentage points off their usual shooting percentage at the rim) than most anyone else. What about that other “x” that’s even a little lower than Gobert’s? Oh yeah, that’s Draymond…with that incredibly rare combination of lateral speed, strength, and rim protecting ability, Draymond is one of the greatest defenders we’ve ever seen, and both Bill Simmons and Zach Lowe have acknowledged that on their respective podcasts. Also, notice that Jokic is garbage at rim protection. Players literally shoot better at the rim when he is defending.\n\nIf I had a lineup of five Gobert’s, they would do an excellent job of rotating to protect the rim, and no shot in the paint would be easy against them, but faster guards who can shoot would toast them at the perimeter. Not a lineup of Draymond Greens. They could effectively protect the rim and switch on a pick-and-roll. Ultimately, that would be the best defensive lineup in NBA history, and I don’t think it can realistically be topped ( a possible defensive lineup that would be better: Gary Payton, Michael Jordan, Scottie Pippen, Kevin Garnett, Tim Duncan. Even then, the five Draymonds would be better. A fantastical better lineup would be three [or four] Scottie Pippens with two [or one] Olajuwons [or Ben Wallaces]. These are the deep questions that I tweet about with no response from more established sports writers. I also stand by my change from Garnett to Olajuwon or Wallace). The following video does a great job of illustrating Draymond’s versatility on the defensive end by showing him switch onto every Blazer in one possession.\n\nI haven’t discussed rebounding as much because, at the end of the day, it’s the least important skillset to consider when building a team. The LeBron Heat years never had a player average over 8.3 rebounds per game, and during their 66-win season, LeBron led the team with 8 rebounds per game (he also led the team with 6.9 rebounds per game in 2013-14). If you argue that their success was an outlier because they had LeBron, then you’re missing the point. LeBron is not inherently dominant and a game changer. LeBron, like all basketball players, happens to fit a very particular archetype that is conducive to success that doesn’t include rebounding.\n\nLook, rebounds are plenty important, and even Dean Oliver identified rebounds as one of the Four Factors in winning, but it’s easily covered up or dominated by a single player. The incredibly innovative Benjamin Morris (again…) proved this in his epic defense of Dennis Rodman as possibly the greatest player of all time (no hyperbole…maybe). It’s a very long read, but one of the greatest pieces of sports analytics out there. Here’s a snippet of a conversation he recalls having with one of his buddies about Dennis Rodman being “the best 3rd best player” ever. This on its own may change the way that you think about star power and team construction:\n\n“Well, it’s tough to say when it’s hard to even define ‘third-best’ player, but [blah blah, ramble ramble, inarticulate nonsense] I guess I’d say he easily had 1st-best player value, which [blah blah, something about diminishing returns, blah blah] . . . which makes him the best 3rd-best player by a wide margin”.\n\n“How wide?”\n\n“Well, it’s not like he’s as valuable as Michael Jordan, but he’s the best 3rd-best player by a wider margin than Jordan was the best 1st-best player.”\n\n“So you’re saying he was better than Michael Jordan.”\n\n“No, I’m not saying that. Michael Jordan was clearly better.”\n\n“OK, take a team with Michael Jordan and Dennis Rodman on it. Which would hurt them more, replacing Michael Jordan with the next-best primary scoring option in NBA history, or replacing Rodman with the next-best defender/rebounder in NBA history?”\n\n“I’m not sure, but probably Rodman.”\n\n“So you’re saying a team should dump Michael Jordan before it should dump Dennis Rodman?”\n\n“Well, I don’t know for sure, I’m not sure exactly how valuable other defender-rebounders are, but regardless, it would be weird to base the whole argument on who happens to be the 2nd-best player. I mean, what if there were two Michael Jordan’s, would that make him the least valuable starter on an All-Time team?”\n\n“Well OK, how common are primary scoring options that are in Jordan’s league value-wise?”\n\n“There are none, I’m pretty sure he has the most value.”\n\n“BALLPARK.”\n\n“I dunno, there are probably between 0 and 2 in the league at any given time.”\n\n“And how common are defender/rebounder/dirty workers that are in Rodman’s league value-wise?”\n\n“There are none.”\n\n“BALLPARK.”\n\n“There are none. Ballpark.”\n\n“So, basically, if a team had Michael Jordan and Dennis Rodman on it, and they could replace either with some random player ‘in the ballpark’ of the next-best player for their role, they should dump Jordan before they dump Rodman?”\n\n“Maybe. Um. Yeah, probably.”\n\n“And I assume that this holds for anyone other than Jordan?”\n\n“I guess.”\n\n“So say you’re head-to-head with me and we’re drafting NBA All-Time teams, you win the toss, you have first pick, who do you take?”\n\n“I don’t know, good question.”\n\n“No, it’s an easy question. The answer is: YOU TAKE RODMAN. You just said so.”\n\n“Wait, I didn’t say that.”\n\n“O.K., fine, I get the first pick. I’ll take Rodman. . . Because YOU JUST TOLD ME TO.”\n\n“I don’t know, I’d have to think about it. It’s possible.”\n\n-Benjamin Morris (2011)\n\nHere’s what Morris is implying in a nutshell: Michael Jordan’s skillset as the GOAT compared to, for argument’s sake, LeBron’s skillset is a smaller margin of dominance as the first option than Dennis Rodman’s skillset over the next best possible third option because Rodman’s unparalleled “Transcendent” dominance in his skillset. Morris even offhandedly references “Diminishing Returns” because Rodman’s skills blend in so fluidly compared to “Ball Dominant” scorers and other popular skillsets.\n\nLet’s not forget that Dennis Rodman was also a 1st Team all Defense for multiple years, so he still combines his “Transcendent” rebounding with “Transcendent” defense. He’s the guy, like Draymond, that you want not as your first option, but as your third-onward option.\n\nWhat does all this mean when constructing a team? It helps point us in the correct direction when somebody inevitably asks the following question: if you could make the best team possible choosing from the following group, who would you choose? Endless possibilities exist to answer this question, but it should somewhat follow this formula:\n\nAn emphasis on as many “Cogs” (players who effectively move the ball) and “Chameleons” (players who can switch onto multiple positions on defense) as possible since they yield the least diminishing returns when grouped together.\n\nAt least one or two “Elite” or better scorers. If you choose multiple scorers, make sure that they are either “Floor Spacers” or “Cutters.”\n\nYou absolutely need “Floor Spacers.” Don’t fall into the same trap as the Cavaliers and just build with “Floor Spacers” that can’t defend though. The Warriors have an excellent selection that can both defend and pass.\n\nIt never hurts to have a couple of players that can rebound. Most elite teams have a “garbage” player of some kind.\n\nOne thing that I never discuss in all of this is the necessity of leadership and having players that aren’t afraid of the moment. Bill Simmons discusses the best teams as those that have “been there” before (2010). They have won championships, so they bring a level of swagger that helps to shed any doubt on the team. I still need to think on this a bit more before I write any further, but I want to acknowledge that this is an important aspect of successful teams. I immediately think of Chauncey Billups or any player that brings a “Veteran Presence” to a team who contributes more than the box score indicates.\n\nOkay, let’s recap quickly because I just spilled a ton of cyber ink in this series.\n\nAll NBA players (and any basketball players ever) can be broken down into four archetypal skillsets which can then be broken down more: Playmaking, Scoring, Defending, and Rebounding.\n\nThe goal of team construction centers around mitigating diminishing returns of specific skills. It’s not enough to just have the “best” players, for those players’ skills must complement each other in a way that they don’t encroach upon each other’s skills.\n\nEach one of these skillsets can be ranked from “Transcendent” to “Inadequate” depending on the player.\n\nAn analysis of specific players and their skillsets (such as Draymond, Curry, Durant, and Gobert) reveal that dominance in a specific subset of each skillset is more important than generally just being a good “scorer.”\n\nAn overview of a few of the greatest teams in history reveals that “Cogs” and “Chameleons’ are the two subsets of the skillsets that most effectively mitigate diminishing returns.\n\nHopefully this helps to orient discussions about team construction and how to choose the most effective lineups. This also serves as a useful (and lengthy) introduction to my next team building project which I will once again unveil in multiple parts. Let’s see how difficult it is to not break my own rules!\n\nAll statistics either from basketballreference.com or stats.nba.com\n\nArticle length: about 1,700 words\n\n(Edit from the future: here are the links to part 2 and part 3).\n\nThe 2016-17 season has unveiled the greatest team in NBA history: The Golden State Warriors. Most fans would incorrectly argue that the ’96 Bulls hold that throne even though Jordan and Pippen were past their primes (Pippen just barely), their post play was insufficient, and their depth was undesirable. Bill Simmons in his The Book of Basketball also points to the watered down of talent in the league at that time (2010). Simmons might argue that the ’86 Celtics still reign as the greatest ever, and I must say, it makes for a very intriguing debate about time periods; however, the sheer dominance of the Warriors’ starters along with the productivity of their bench still convince me that no team could beat them in a seven-game series.\n\nThis post isn’t interested in debating which team is the best and why though. My interest lies in the team construction that makes a team dominant and successful. Why are the ’86 Celtics and ’17 Warriors regarded as the best? What do (did) they have that other teams don’t? And, of course, what could theoretically make them better? Ultimately, this theoretical framework will inform a forthcoming article (series?) where I construct the Second Tier Universe Cup Team. If you’re anything like me, you’ll find this new wrinkle more interesting than the first.\n\nAs I mentioned in a previous article where I criticized Team USA’s Olympic team after analyzing the best superstar duos and trios in history:\n\nThis lays a solid groundwork for showing what is required to be the best for superstars to mesh: at least a dominant scorer, multiple excellent defenders, and multiple above average playmakers with one excellent playmaker.\n\n– Cody Houdek, “Building a Super Team and Other Observations,” 2016\n\nThe question now is broader and requires more definitions though because no theory (even basketball theory) is complete with pedantic definitions, so buckle up, and I promise that the end result of reading this series will be worth it for looking at basketball with a new perspective.\n\nAt their core, it seems that every basketball player can be boiled down to four distinct archetypes much like an RPG like “The Elder Scrolls.” These archetypes depend on four core skills: playmaking, scoring, defense, and rebounding. One can reduce each of these skills near infinitely to capture the myriad subtleties involved with the beautiful game, but I won’t spend much time doing that now. If you want a weird, philosophical dive into a Borgesian analysis of Ginobili’s creativity, then I urge you to read this and this article. I will try and differentiate a bit between very different skillsets within these archetypal skills such as offensive rebounding vs. defensive rebounding and off-ball shooting scorers vs. isolations scorers.\n\nJust replace these with basketball terms, and you basically have what I’m talking about.\n\nI have broken down each of these archetypal categories into a 0-10 scale where each number is associated with a tier of ability (again, like an RPG). This scale is as follows: Transcendent- 10-9; Elite – 8-7; Proficient – 6-5; Average – 4; Sub-par – 3-2; Inadequate – 1-0. I’ll discuss the meaning behind each of these a little later.\n\nIs this an exact science? Oh goodness no, but it’s a good place to start when trying to define team building. My gut tells me, as I more simply stated in that aforementioned article, that successful teams have an abundance of playmakers and defenders, at least one player who can score at will, and adequate rebounding.\n\nWhat does any of this mean? To me, a playmaker is a player that can create offense for his teammates. Most people look to assists to measure this, but the skill goes far beyond that. It includes players who help the offense function smoother through unselfishness and a skillset that draws their opponents’ attention. For example, players like Magic Johnson and Steve Nash score very high in this category because of how they can set their teammates up to make easy shots (they also post extremely high assist totals). Conversely, Stephen Curry and LeBron James would also score very high despite their average assist numbers because of their different abilities – Curry’s tremendous gravity and LeBron’s strength and IQ – promote teammate success. Essentially, if a playmaker is on the court, his team’s offense shouldn’t stagnate. We can differentiate playmakers in three ways: excellent passers who set up individual teammates for easy shots (let’s call them “Dime Droppers”), unselfish passers who don’t hold the ball too long during an offensive possession (let’s call them “Cogs”), and players who excel in both these categories (“Floor Generals”).\n\nA scorer then is a player who can score the basketball. Groundbreaking, right, but the intrigue lies in the details. How do you compare a scorer like Dominique Wilkins and Peja Stojakovic? How do you compare Ray Allen with Tracy McGrady? How do you compare Shaq with Kobe? Differentiating these abilities is key to building a successful lineup because basketball is a game of diminishing returns meaning that the more players who both excel in a single skill and share the court with one another, the less the team will benefit from each individual’s skills (to me, this is the true beauty of the Warriors’ offense, and I will get to that later). If a team has five Carmelo Anthonys, every Carmelo won’t average 30 points per game on good efficiency. While we can definitely differentiate scorers into many many categories, let’s just stick to just a few for now: players who need the ball in their hands to create scoring opportunities (“Ball Dominant”), floor spacers who score efficiently off spot-up and other off-ball shooting possessions (“Floor Spacers” actually has a classic ring to it), and players who can either (or both) dive to the basket or run in transition for easy scoring opportunities (“Runners”), and the combinations of these skills (it’s tough coming up with names).\n\n…basketball is a game of diminishing returns meaning that the more players who both excel in a single skill and share the court with one another, the less the team will benefit from each individual’s skills.\n\n– Cody Houdek, “NBA Theory: Player Archetypes and Team Construction Part 1,” 2017\n\nA defender is a player who makes it more difficult for the other team to score. By far, this is the most difficult to quantify statistically, and even with the advent of analytics, we have no great way to express a player’s defensive worth through a singular number, so specific player categorizations are more open for debate. This makes comparing the worth of two players’ defensive impacts extremely difficult as discussed by Ben Dowsett. Which would be more impactful for a team defense: Gobert’s stalward rim-protection or Draymond Green’s ability to seamlessly switch 1-5? As always, the answer is that it depends. Defense can be broken down to four different categories: a defender who can shut down a single matchup (“Lockdown Defender”), a player who protects the basket effectively (“Rim Protector”), switch-happy players that can defend multiple positions and allow the team to switch more smoothly (“Chameleons” because they can blend in with any system), and players who can disrupt offenses off the ball by playing free safety, so to speak (“Roamers”).\n\nFinally, rebounders are players who clean the glass either on the offensive or defensive glass. Like scoring, this is probably best quantified through the many advanced statistics at our disposal such as Offensive Rebound Percentage and Contested Rebounds. This can be split into two categories: players who excel at grabbing offensive rebounds (“Offensive Rebounders”) and players who excel at grabbing defensive rebounds (“Defensive Rebounders”).\n\nBefore I can apply this theory to any specific player, it’s first necessary to define each level of grading on the above continuum. Starting at the bottom (now, where am I?), we have “Inadequate” which applies to a deficiency in the specific skill that significantly hurts the team. This is a bit tricky because some skills aren’t as important for certain positions such as rebounding and, to a small degree, defense for point guards while a center who isn’t a good rebounder would cause a net negative for his team. Scoring a “Sub-par” means that a player has a deficiency in a certain skill, but that deficiency isn’t as much of a concern as an Inadequate skill. Think of Andre Roberson’s free-throw shooting as a good example. It’s poor enough that teams can employ the “Hack-a” strategy against him which significantly hurts the Thunder; however, if he were just above this level where teams couldn’t target him, I would consider that “Sub-par.”\n\nBeing “Proficient” and “Average” are very difficult to differentiate between, but I would draw the line at reliability. A player who is “Proficient” in a specific skill is one who can, most of the time, execute that skillset. Players like J.R. Smith add an extra level of difficulty in this because he defies the reliability aspect of this definition; however, I would feel comfortable with him shooting open threes over most any “Average” shooters while the apex of his skillset is significantly higher than “Average” shooters.\n\nHere’s where things get interesting and where teams are truly constructed. Players who fall within the “Elite” and “Transcendent” levels are those who are considered stars. Remember this: teams cannot be successful without “Elite” or higher skills in multiple skillsets (I’ll discuss which ones a little later). On a definitional level, these are the two easiest levels to differentiate between. A player with an “Elite” skillset means that they are one of the best in the league at the time that they are (were) playing at that skillset. Players who have a “Transcendent” skillset means that they are in the upper echelon of that skillset regardless of time. You could pluck them out of their temporal playing moment and plop them in any time period, and they would still be one of the best. Their ability “transcends” time.\n\nNow we can get to the interesting part and apply these definitions to actual players to see what team makeups have been successful. Just as a reminder, players cannot be judged as a conglomeration of their entire careers. A player must be chosen during a specific year of their career that spans both the playoffs and the regular season. You can apply this to either one of the two, but you miss out by not judging a player based off the entirety of the season and post-season. In the next article, I’ll lay out how this will look for specific players.\n\nArticle Length: ~2,200 words or about 10-13 minutes of reading\n\nThe season is well underway, and I haven’t written a single blog post about it so far. I’ve tried tweeting more this season, but honestly that’s not my cup of tea. I tried (in the last couple of days) being more active on Facebook, but again I think social media just isn’t my forte. So I apologize for ignoring tons of important happenings around the league, but my post for today is one that I wanted to release before the season began. We’ve past the quarter mark, so unfortunately, I know too much to make it quite as fun.\n\nThis blog post is based off a classic sports question: if I could start an NBA team with any two players, who would I pick? I’ll do three variations of his question today regarding this season, the next five seasons, and the next ten seasons. For the first part, I want to start a team by choosing only two players to start. My one and only goal for the season is to win a championship. For the second part, my only goal is to win as many championships in five years, and the pattern continues for the third part. Let’s get started.\n\nQuestion One: which two players do I choose to win a championship this season?\n\nAs far as I’m concerned, LeBron is a lock for one of the two spots. Even as his age rises, his production remains at an astoundingly high level, and nothing illustrates that more than last Finals where he led both teams in points, rebounds, assists, steals, and blocks while dragging his down-and-out Cavaliers from a 3-1 deficit against the unanimous MVP in Curry and the greatest regular season team in NBA history. Truly a storybook Finals for LeBron, the Cavaliers, and the city of Cleveland. Even this year where LeBron has taken his biggest step back in scoring, his team leads the Easter Conference, and he’s still in the top 5 MVP candidates for the year. You cannot convince me that LeBron isn’t worthy of selection.\n\nThe second choice is much more difficult, and honestly I tried writing this post a couple of months ago, but I became so frustrated by not being able to select a second player that I just left it alone. In my opinion, only two players deserve to be in the conversation, and interestingly enough, they are currently teammates: Kevin Durant and Stephen Curry (side note: Anthony Davis is really close to also being included, but I can’t trust his porcelain structure to remain intact for an entire season/post-season). Most would say that Curry is the obvious choice as he is coming off one of (if not the) most impressive season in NBA History (playoffs excluded), but the two things that greatly concern me about him are his defense and his performance post knee injury. Like Bird before him, Curry makes up for his poor one-on-one defensive attributes by being an above average team defender which helped him lead the league in steals per game, but those instincts aren’t enough completely cover his defensive woes as the Cavaliers game-plan in the Finals proved.\n\nKevin Durant has proven this season that he can fit right into an already established team by simply taking more efficient and more open shots. I was worried that Durant would struggle with the Warriors game-plan which is predicated off ball movement and player movement (the latter of which never being Durant’s strong suit), but he has done a marvelous job of letting himself move off the ball. In the past, Durant’s defense has been hit-or-miss at best, but starting with the Warriors/Thunder playoff series last season, Durant has been on a tear defensively, and with the Warriors, he has posted career highs in Defensive Box Plus/Minus and blocks along with his second best defensive rating during a season.\n\nMy final verdict is that I would start a team with LeBron James and Kevin Durant. Their games complement each other perfectly as LeBron looks to facilitate and run the plays as Durant likes to, well, score efficiently. When locked in, they would become the most terrifying defensive duo on the league, and on the fastbreak, no duo in history could hold a candle to them. Currently LeBron leads the league in fastbreak points per game (where he shoots 76.5%) and Durant is fifth in the league (where he shoots 60.6%).\n\nVerdict: LeBron/Durant\n\nHindsight verdict 2015-2016: LeBron/Curry\n\nQuestion Two: which two players do I choose to win the most championships in the next five seasons?\n\nFive years is a long time in the basketball world. Five years ago the Miami Heat were just coming off an embarrassing Finals loss to the Dallas Mavericks led by god-mode Nowitzki. In the present, Nowitzki will probably retire after the end of the season. The point is that choosing who will be consistently successful over the course of five years is extremely difficult if not impossible. Five years ago, Curry only played 26 games, and people thought that his career would be lost to injuries. Mind-blowing huh?\n\nPlayers within the 23-27 year-old range are more than likely the best candidates for this thought experiment. Right around 29 is general a player’s prime, but many players find their best seasons to be right around 31-33. Unfortunately, this means that LeBron won’t make my duo. For as many minutes as he has played already, I can’t see him staying this productive until he’s 36-37. Sorry ‘Bron.\n\nDurant is 28 and some change, but I’m going to have to select him as my first option. Along with my defense of him above, I have a strong feeling that his game will age gracefully a-la Kobe, MJ, and Dirk who learned to dominate the midrange and post-game. His length and size will always make him a serviceable defender as well.\n\nLike the first question, the second choice here is much tougher. LeBron is the perfect starting point because he works best with other high-volume scorers e.g. Kyrie Irving and Dwyane Wade. Durant is not like this, and I’m not quite sure what kind of player would complement him the best (besides LeBron). I’m not picking Curry because A), I don’t think he’s necessarily the best choice for Durant’s sidekick, and B) did you know Curry is actually a couple hundred days older than Durant? I don’t see Curry’s dominance holding up as he hits his early thirties.\n\nDurant needs to be with a player that doesn’t look to score as a first option. Durant can run an offense well-enough, but I would preferably have a different, better playmaking player running the show. Or, I could go a different direction and select a hard-nosed, defensive menace of a post-player. Why am I not immediately jumping at the chance to pair Anthony Davis and Durant to make the longest duo in NBA history? Well I’m not sold on Anthony Davis. He has the range, athleticism, and defensive speed of a young Kevin Garnett, but he simply doesn’t playmake well (he has more turnovers than assists this season), he shoots too many jumpshots, and he is extremely fragile. Am I overthinking things? Of course I am. Really I think a great complement for Durant would be Draymond Green, but I feel that I’d be wasting my second pick if I didn’t take a more elite player.\n\nAt the end of the day, I’d regret not taking Davis. I can’t imagine a team with quick enough or big enough defenders to guard both of them adequately…hell teams can’t guard either one adequately as it is! With the right defensive scheme too, teams would struggle mightily with a Durant/Davis switching scheme. The possibilities are endless.\n\nQuick explanation: I feel that so far, Westbrook, Harden, and Leonard have been swept under the rug. Westbrook and Harden (especially Westbrook) are putting up anomalous seasons, the likes of which we have never witnessed. Both of them are magnificent to watch, and they truly are winners. Unfortunately, I can’t trust Westbrook’s decision making, and Harden’s defensive awareness and leadership leave much to be desired. Leonard to me is still a solid tier beneath these players, and I think he’s a much better fit with a primary defender and playmaker than a straight up scorer.\n\nVerdict: Kevin Durant/Anthony Davis\n\nHindsight Verdict 5 years ago (2011-12): LeBron/Durant\n\nQuestion Three: which two players do I choose to win the most championships in the next ten seasons?\n\nLeBron will be 41. Durant will be 38. Vince Carter will be 40ish days from 50. I think it’s time to really scout the young guns. Right now, this is the most excited that I can recall being excited for a current batch of young talent such as Karl Anthony Towns, Giannis Antetokounmpo, Kristaps Porzingis, Jabari Parker, Andrew Wiggins, Joel Embiid, Anthony Davis, Kyrie Irving (dude is only 24??), Brandon Ingram, Jamal Murray, D’Angelo Russell, and the list goes on. The next 15 years will be extremely exciting to watch develop.\n\nTwo huge factors contribute to my decision about these two players: who will contribute sufficiently to win soon (front-loaders) and who will contribute consistently for the next 10 years (back-loaders). If I focused primarily on that 19-24 year-old range, the two top front-loaders are Anthony Davis and Kyrie Irving. Irving has been a starting point guard for two Finals qualifying teams, and iced a game 7 to win the Finals against the 73-9 Warriors. Irving is not afraid of the moment, and Davis is seasoned enough to jump right into the playoffs.\n\nIn a shocking twist of events though, I will not be selecting either of these two players. Kyrie Irving is a truly special scorer, and in isolation situations this season, nobody stacks up to him. The below scatter plot show the 15 players who attempt the most field goals per game in an isolation situation. The Y-Axis shows those players’ effective field goal percentages. Remember: being above the line is a good thing.\n\nWhile he is special as a scorer, I think that he’s somewhat lost as the main ball-handler. He needs a player like a LeBron, Giannis, Draymond, or any player with whom Curry would thrive. As the above link also discusses, his defense leaves much to be desired.\n\nI really can’t put my finger on why I’m not as high on Anthony Davis. Maybe it’s his injury history, his overrated defense, his poor playmaking ability, or a combination of the three. Davis is special, don’t get me wrong, but I don’t think he’s as special as some might make you believe. He’s long and athletic, which is a combination, as I’ve discussed previously, is one that I cherish. So what two players could impossibly long and athletic enough to fit my desires? What players really seem to be on the brink of revolutionizing the league? I’ll tell you who, but I must admit that I’m wildly biased in my first pick. I choose Giannis Antetokounmpo and Kristaps Porzingis.\n\nGiannis finally made the leap this year. As I’ve tweeted about before, Giannis is in the running for defensive player of the year. He also can (somewhat) play and guard all five positions, and is confidently leading a Middleton-less Bucks squad above .500. Giannis is legit, and the fact that he only recently turned 22 means that he’s only going to get better and smarter. His athleticism may dwindle slightly as he ages, but his length never will. He still makes plays that nobody in the league can make, and the last player to make similar plays was a younger dude named LeBron James (and oddly enough, a younger Josh Smith).\n\nPorzingis is a unicorn through and through. We simply have never seen anybody like him before. He runs like a deer, plays incredible post defense, shoots a very consistent jumpshot, and has an even temperament. I don’t want to throw the name Dirk out there yet, so I’ll let the stats back me up.\n\nSome may scream that KAT or Embiid should get the nod over him if I’m going to go with a lanky, potential-filled big man, but KAT’s defense is overrated, and he has a tendency to jump into hero-ball mode. Embiid, much like Davis, scares me with his injury history. Maybe he’ll become a post player like we’ve never seen, but maybe he’ll be the next Greg Oden….I’m not denying that Embiid’s potential and skill is off the chart. Much like Oden, Embiid is incredibly skilled and locked into playing defense. Check out this second scatter plot showing the 21 players who defend the most shots at the rim per game. The lower the plot point, the lower the percentage to which the defender holds his opponent to.\n\nThe two lowest points? Embiid and Porzingis. When defending the rim, they cause their opponents to shoot 15.7 percentage points and 14.4 percentage points respectively worse than the shooter would normally shoot.\n\nVerdict: Giannis/Porzingis\n\nHindsight Verdict 10 years ago (2006-07): LeBron James/Tim Duncan (closely followed by Chris Paul and Dwyane Wade as a second choice)\n\nAll stars are either from Basketball Reference or NBA Stats. Graph data extracted from NBA Stats play type data.\n\nArticle Length: ~1,600 words or about 8-13 minutes of reading.\n\nThe 2015-2016 NBA season is underway. We’re about eight games into the season and blogger after blogger is racing to jump to the wildest conclusions, such as Kobe Bryant is literally the worst player ever, Stephen Curry is literally the best player ever, the Golden State Warriors would’ve waxed the 1995-1996 Bulls, this is the greatest draft class of all-time, and Andre Drummond has overtaken Rodman/Russell/Wilt/Moses as the greatest rebounder of all-time.\n\nI mean, Curry’s shot-chart against the Pelicans is just stupid.\n\nBut I’ve already beaten the curve and made my predictions before the season started, so we can ignore actual analysis for now. We all know how teams are doing as of now, but how well would teams fare with one little wrinkle? Let’s say that every player reverted back to their specific prime, then which team would be the best?\n\nNow nobody ever has taken the “prime” hypothetical as far as Bill Simmons, and I truly believe his is the standard by which every fan should think. Here, instead of ambiguously imagining Chris Paul in his prime, you have to specifically choose the single best year of his career. Trust me, this is much more difficult than it seems. Now I’m not going to go through every roster and defend all of my choices, so I’ll go through the top few teams. Let’s do the top five teams in the NBA.\n\nHonorable mentions:\n\nDallas Mavericks\n\nDeron Williams 2007-08; Wesley Matthews 2013-14; Chandler Parsons 2013-2014; Dirk Nowitzki 2006-07 (I would accept 2010-11); Javale McGee 2010-11\n\nPeople forget that Deron vs. Chris Paul was a legitimate debate around 2009. He never matched Paul’s defensive instincts, but boy could Deron ball out hard in a pick and roll. I imagine he and Dirk would cook up some magic on the pick and pop, especially with Wes hiding in the corner. Javale automatically places them at the bottom of the best though.\n\nMemphis Grizzlies\n\n2013-14 Mike Conley; Vince Carter 2000-01; Jeff Green 2009-10; Zach Randolph 2009-10; Marc Gasol 2014-15.\n\nFinally, the Grizzlies get the go-to scorer in Vince Carter that they’ve desperately needed to get over the hump. No that’s not an eye-popping starting lineup, but they would get the job done.\n\nChicago Bulls\n\nDerrick Rose 2010-11; Jimmy Butler 2014-15; Mike Dunleavy 2007-08; Pau Gasol 2010-11; Joakim Noah 2013-14.\n\nUnlike the 2011 playoff Bulls, this squad will have four legitimate scoring threats between Butler, Rose, Dunleavy, and Gasol. With the twin towers of Gasol and Noah combined with both of their crafty passing abilities, this would be a very dangerous starting lineup. How are there still five better teams than this? Oh, you’ll see. YOU WON’T BELIEVE NUMBER 2!! Just kidding, but maybe.\n\nNow for the top dogs of the newly rejuvenated NBA\n\nGolden State Warriors\n\nStephen Curry 2015-16; Klay Thompson 2014-15; Andre Iguodala 2009-10; Draymond Green 2015-16; Andrew Bogut 2009-10\n\nI know that it’s completely blasphemous for the Warriors to be anything but #1 (#5 no less), but hear me out. This team would be absolutely destructive, even more so than the all-time juggernaut that actually exists. With Bogut and Iguodala being tossed back into their primes, their starting lineup has three players that can guard multiple positions, and a tank that clogged the paint as well as any in the late single digit 2000s. Iguodala even gives them another premiere pass-first playmaker, which would make their potent offense even more beautiful.\n\nThe thing is, they don’t get much deeper. Harrison Barnes brings some firepower off the bench, and besides Livingston and Mo Speights retaining whatever of their primes they lost, there’s nothing very special coming out after the terrifying starting lineup. Regardless, I would never choose to play this team in any situation.\n\nCleveland Cavaliers\n\nKyrie Irving 2014-15; Richard Jefferson 2007-08; LeBron James 2012-13; Kevin Love 2011-12; Timofey Mozgov 2014-15\n\nImmediately some people will disagree with my pick for LeBron’s prime year, claiming that it was his statistically absurd 2009-10 year. While that was certainly the most eye-popping performance he gave, his play during his third year with Heat was such an awe-inspiring combination of efficiency and patience, unlike any we’ve ever seen.\n\nPeople often forget that Richard Jefferson averaged over 19 points per game on four separate occasions in the mid-2000s. If he can run alongside Kidd and Carter, then he’d be a perfect fast break companion to LeBron and Kyrie.\n\nBesides this, the Cavs gain the all-star firepower of Mo Williams off the bench along with Shumpert, Smith, Thompson and Varejao. Honestly, that unit could stand as a (very poor) starting lineup in this league. Didn’t the Knicks essentially start this team a few years ago…\n\nI apologize about the quality of number 1.\n\nLos Angeles Clippers\n\nChris Paul 2008-09; JJ Redick 2014-15; Paul Pierce 2005-06; Blake Griffin 2014-15; Deandre Jordan 2014-15\n\nNo, I’m not lazy by having Redick, Griffin, and Jordan from last season. It’s just that, all things considered, those are their best seasons so far, and I’m not seeing noticeable improvement during this ongoing year. Some may argue that Griffin actually played better in previous seasons, but after his Herculean performance in the playoffs, it would take an unbelievable effort to come close to matching that. Chris Paul on the other hand was a monstrous one-man wrecking crew right around 2010. If anyone post-2000 could make Stephen Curry’s life Hell on both the offensive and defensive end, it’s 2009 Chris Paul.\n\nThe most important part that separates this Clipper squad isn’t the starting lineup, but the bench. With Stephenson, Josh Smith, and Jamal Crawford all playing together, you essentially have an above average starting lineup coming in as the second unit. Josh Smith is the key here, and people forget that around 2007, Smith was one of the most intriguing athletic players in the league. I honestly couldn’t understand why he wasn’t magically turning into LeBron with even better defensive instincts. While that never panned out, he still rewarded us with an array of acrobatic dunks and vicious swats. My only fear that holds this team back is the knucklehead potential between these three players.\n\nMiami Heat\n\nGoran Dragic 2013-14; Dwyane Wade 2008-09; Luol Deng 2010-11; Chris Bosh 2013-14; Hassan Whiteside 2015-16\n\nThe Heat are stupid stacked. Nothing illustrated this clearer than my decision to bench 2007-08 Amar’e Stoudemire, who averaged 25 ppg on 59% shooting. Am I completely crazy? No because it’s all about fit. With older, more refined Bosh starting at the stretch-four, Wade and Dragic have so much more space into which they can drive and kick. Whiteside gets the nod over Stoudemire because of his paint-gobbling and defensive instincts. Either Bosh or Whiteside can come out at any time to create a dynamic pick and roll duo between Wade and Stoudemire or Dragic and Stoudemire.\n\nAlong with Stoudemire, Winslow, Chalmers, Haslem, and, wait for it, 2007-08 Jason Richardson would lead the second unit. That’s actually a very good starting lineup right there! Richardson played in the league about seven years too early with his absurd athleticism and sniper-like three point shooting. In 2007-08, he connected on 3 three-pointers a game while shooting 40% from that range. A lineup with Dragic, Wade, Ricardson, Bosh, and Stoudemire would be absolutely unstoppable on offense if Wade was the primary ballhandler. Maybe they’d leave a bit to be desired on defense, but come on!\n\nSan Antonio Spurs\n\nTony Parker 2008-09; Danny Green 2014-15; Kawhi Leonard 2015-16; LaMarcus Aldridge 2014-15; Tim Duncan 2002-03\n\nDoes anybody remember how good Tim Duncan actually was? In the ’03 finals versus Jason Kidd’s NJ Nets, Duncan averaged a whopping 24-17-5 with 5.3 blocks over six games. Let’s put that into perspective by comparing to players on the team that achieved the second highest of each of those stats. Tony Parker averaged 10 points, David Robinson averaged 7.3 rebounds, Parker averaged 4.2 assists, and David Robinson averaged 1.8 blocks per game, which makes the statline OF THE DIFFERENCE between Duncan’s numbers and second highest essentially 14-10-1 with 3.5 blocks. That’s better than any other person on the team! Duncan was that team, unlike how the Spurs function nowadays. Pair him with DPoY Leonard, knockdown shooter and fantastic defender Green, mid-range aficionado Aldridge, and lightning quick Tony Parker, and you have a starting lineup that could not be rivaled.\n\nLook at that statline. Some people have argued that the league missed counting two blocks; nonetheless, it’s still an unbelievable performance.\n\nConsider then 2007-08 Ginobili, 2007-08 David West, and 2005-06 Boris Diaw coming off the bench, providing enough versatility to give any of the five starters a rest. With a lineup of Ginobili, Green, Leonard, Daw, and Duncan, they would have five players that can guard multiple positions, and a backcourt averaging a total of 5 steals per game. Between that and Duncan’s otherworldly defensive presence, nobody, not even the firing squad the Miami Heat would bring, could handle it.\n\nDisagree with a specific year I picked for a player, think I missed a team, or disagree with the order of my teams? Then go ahead and let me know via Twitter, email, Facebook, or just comment right on this post. I’m always up for a discussion.\n\nAs always, all stats from basketball-reference.com\n\nArticle Length: ~1,100 words or about 6-8 minutes of reading.\n\nI considered doing a post analyzing the upcoming NBA draft, but to be perfectly honest, my knowledge of NCAA players is adequate at best, and even so I don’t understand how people can tell if a player will translate well into the NBA. I feel particularly bad at that, seeing as my history with the draft includes believing Greg Oden should go before Kevin Duant, Michael Beasley would be a superstar, and Doug McBuckets would be a 6th man of the year candidate (jury still out on that one). The newest player that I’m probably too high on his Tyler Harvey, the leading scorer in the NCAA this last year. He averaged 23 points on 45-43-85 (field-goal/three-point/free-throw) showing percentages, while leading Eastern Washington to a 13th seed into the Big Dance. Why isn’t he showing up on any draft boards? Check out his highlight video below and tell me he doesn’t have a similar playstyle as Brandon Roy.\n\nA lefty with an unlimited three-point range and a dirty step-back J? Sign me up!\n\nAnd clearly he can heat up in a hurry.\n\nI may not be able to choose with any sort of accuracy who is going to translate well in the league, but being a Bucks fan, I can assure you I know how to make a bad front office decision.\n\nOkay, now that my little rant is out of the way, let’s continue with my hypothetical trip through the 2015 Playoffs. If you’d missed them, you can find part 4, part 3, part 2, and part 1 in my archives. We’ve finally made it to the Conference Finals where the Warriors (with Anthony Davis and Marc Gasol) face the Rockets (with Monta Ellis and Kawhi Leonard) in the west, and the Hawks (with Alan Anderson) square off against the Cavaliers (with Jae Crowder and Jimmy Butler).\n\nWe know that the Warriors mercilessly slaughter the Rockets in a 4-1 series, culminating in James Harden’s worst single-game performance of his career (at least as a Rocket). What if he actually had help though? What if Ellis and Leonard game him some sort of support through this beating of a series? While the team looks good on paper, that Warriors squad with 4/5 players being on one of the All-NBA teams (with the fifth being on an All-Defensive team) would absolutely obliterate the Rockets. Leonard would make Curry’s life a nightmare, but then they would just run the offense through Marc Gasol, who has proven that a playmaker can be very successful in the post.\n\nSeriously, look at that court awareness! Post scoring itself might be dead, but I think a resurgence of the Vlade Divac type post playmakers is at hand.\n\nI really wish there was more to analyze in this matchup, but pure and simple that Warriors team would be incredible beyond words. The ending of this series will be sadly anticlimactic I believe, but hey, might as well finish it.\n\nSo after beating the Rockets, the Warriors can snag one of their opponents. But which one? Between Harden, Ellis, Leonard, and Howard, the Warriors have a bunch of options from which to choose. To me though, only one truly makes sense. The Warriors already have enough ball-handling, scoring, and post-defense/rebounding to last a lifetime. The only player I would consider replacing on their squad is Draymond Green, who, I think you have to drop for Kawhi Leonard. It’s official, this squad is unbeatable.\n\nIn the East now, we have basically the same Hawks against a slightly souped-up Cavaliers team. Since the Cavs actually won the series 4-0 behind the ridiculous one-man wrecking crew of LeBron James’ 30.3/11/9.3 (points/rebounds/assists), I think it’s fairly safe to assume that the only thing that would change in this series in our hypothetical universe is that LeBron’s stats go down a bit with Butler shouldering a bit more of the load. Once again, not too much to analyze.\n\nYou can, however, analyze this absurd performance. What a freak.\n\nNow with the Hawks being such a great, cohesive unit, it makes the Cavaliers’ decision pretty difficult as to whom they should take. At this point in the playoffs, Kyrie is looking pretty banged up, so Jeff Teague is a definite option. Korver is sadly out, or else he would average 6 more points a game playing next to LeBron (seriously though, think about it for a second. Just think about LeBron and Korver together…..). Carroll is a bit hobbled or else he’d make a nice addition. And then there’s Paul Millsap and Al Horford to consider, both of them being highly-skilled, versatile big man that play both ends of the court exceptionally well. The thing is, there was still that glimmer of hope the Cavs had that Kyrie would play in the Finals (which was granted to them with a genie like twist after game one), so taking Teague wouldn’t make the most sense since one of them would come off the bench. I think the decision is down to either Horford or Millsap, both of whom would slide in nicely to their starting Power-Forward and backup Center. In this scenario though, LeBron and Butler need help and spacing on the offensive end, so I think the Horford would be the best option. He played the Power Forward slot earlier in his career, and he provides another offensive option that can create for other, finish at the basket, or step out for a long range jumper, which, especially from midrange, he shot exceptionally well.\n\nYou know, I really thought this whole series would lead up to an epic finale where I broke down how the two super teams would matchup. I thought I’d provide some excellent insight showing how choosing the correct player from round to round would affect the Finals’ outcome. Well I was wrong. What we have right now is a Warriors vs. Cavaliers Finals with the lineups Curry-Thompson-Leonard-Davis-Gasol against Dellavedova-Butler-James-Horford-Mozgov. Sure, the Cavs team would be a very good team, one that would be incredibly fun to watch, but it’s still within the realm of possibility that they could be assembled. The Warriors squad looks like an all-star team, or, as I’ve said a few times, and All-NBA team. Just because of James’ brilliance, the Cavs might sneak out one victory, but even that is a long shot. The Warriors would make a complete mockery of the Cavs, and then replace Leonard with James to make the greatest NBA powerhouse to ever sweep through the regular season.\n\nSo there you have it. The Play for Keeps Playoffs: 2015 edition is finally over. Hopefully next year doesn’t cheat us entertainment by having so many injuries again. Now get ready to watch the NBA draft, and if you want my draft insight, you can go back and read my own pre-draft analysis.\n\nArticle Length: ~1,100 words or about 6-8 minutes of reading.\n\nIn the second installment of this series (building off the first), I capped off the first round by going through the Eastern Conference’s decisions. It’s finally time to move on to the second round, so that I can finish this series by the time next year’s playoffs start.\n\nStarting in the Western Conference, we have the #1 Warriors (with newly acquired Anthony Davis) versus the #5 Grizzlies (with newly acquired LaMarcus Adridge). Had my blog existed before this matchup, the world (or the 14 people that read this) would’ve known that I claimed the Grizzlies would win this matchup. I thought Tony Allen and Mike Conley would do an excellent job pestering Klay Thompson and Stephen Curry, and that their bigs would ultimately overpower Andrew Bogut and Draymond Green. Well as fate would have it, Conley was injured and the Warriors decided not to guard Tony Allen, so their inspiring 2-1 lead in the series crumbled away quickly. Even this time around with Aldridge roaming the paint for Memphis, scoring midrange jumper after midrange jumper, I don’t think they have the firepower to stop the best team in the league….with Anthony Davis (I can’t stress this enough). The Warrior’s paint-stopping duo of Bogut and Davis would be far too much for Aldridge and Gasol to handle, overpowering them in the paint, and continuing to rain triple after triple, courtesy of Thompson and Curry.\n\nSo after trapping and slaying the Grizzlies, the Warriors now have a chance to add to their roster. Even in this wild hypothetical world, the Warriors luck out by having the chance to pick up players that would perfectly compliment them. They wouldn’t hesitate for a single second in swapping Andrew Bogut for Marc Gasol, who just came off being selected to the All-NBA First Team, and won Defensive Player of the Year in 2012-2013 (an award that I will forever contest, but that’s for another day). Gasol’s interior passing, scoring, and defense would let the twin towers of Davis-Gasol open up the wings even more for the best backcourt shooting duo in history. Just in case you’re wondering, this roster addition would mean that 3/5 starters were voted First Team All-NBA (Curry, Davis, and Gasol), one was Third Team All-NBA (Thompson), and the third was second in Defensive Player of the Year voting (Green). Can we just give the hypothetical Warriors the championship now?\n\nNext are the #2 Rockets with Monta Ellis versus the #3 Clippers (coming off one of the more embarrassing choke jobs by a team ever) with Kawhi Leonard. First of all, this game doesn’t go to seven games if Leonard is on the Clippers team. They win in four, and I have no doubts in my mind it would be a pathetic series. Leonard would make Harden’s life a living Hell, and unless Smith and Howard can keep up their relentless alley oops from game 2, the Rockets wouldn’t even sniff a victory in this series.\n\nIf this is the case, then history has been changed, and the Clippers move on to face the Warriors. The Clippers already would have a formidable starting lineup, so taking the easy route and picking James Harden may not be as intuitive of a decision as it seems. The other choice would be snagging Josh Smith (who only started 3/7 games in the series) and bringing him off the bench instead of Austin Rivers, which would be a huge improvement. But let’s be honest, the Clippers would totally replace Redick with Harden, giving them a starting lineup of Chris Paul, James Harden, Kawhi Leonard, Blake Griffin, and Deandre Jordan. Oh. My. God. As formidable as the Warriors’ lineup looks, you have to admit that you started sweating a bit thinking about this match-up. In the end though, the Warriors would still win because of their never ending depth (e.g., David Lee and Andre Iguodala).\n\nLet’s look at how things actually turned out though, and pretend that somehow the Rockets pull off a seven game upset again. Their main choices would certainly have to be Paul, Leonard, Griffin, and Jordan. Immediately they’d eliminate Jordan, who did everything slightly worse than Dwight Howard during this year’s playoffs. Next, and any other year it would kill me to say this, but they have to eliminate Paul because of his ailing hamstring injury he sustained in game seven of the Spurs-Clippers series. Plus, with Ellis and Harden already running the show, they need some more size and less guard play. The decision between Griffin and Leonard might just be the most difficult one of the series. Leonard, the newly crowned defensive player of the year, is such a defensive stalwart that Kirk Goldsberry of Grantland wrote an entire article about it. Beyond that, he averaged 20 points per game while shooting 47.7/42.3/77.1 shooting percentages (field-goal percent/Three-point percent/ free-throw percent). On the other side of the coin, Blake Griffin was nothing short of brilliant in the playoffs, hailed as its best performer before being eliminated in embarrassing fashion, averaging an astonishing 25.5 points/ 12.7 rebounds/ 6.1 assists. In fact, the only other player in history to average at least 25/12/6 in the playoffs is none other than Oscar Robertson himself.\n\nThe match-ups are what it boils down to for me. If I take Leonard than I have the best defensive player to matchup against the MVP, but that leaves Terrence Jones and Josh Smith to defend Anthony Davis. If I take Griffin, than Davis must work harder, along with my having another playmaker on the court. I wish you all knew how seriously I take this decision, and how difficult it truly is for me, but I think the Rockets would choose Kawhi Leonard. He helps to stretch the floor more, his stoic play gets in other players’ heads, and, as I mentioned before, his claw-like defense. I know I’d regret this decision no matter which I chose, so I had to go with the stellar defense.\n\nYou know, I very much intended this article to include both the Eastern Conference and Western Conference, but I didn’t realize how long my explanations would take. I understand the difficulty in reading an article that seems to last forever, therefore, I believe firmly in splitting up articles in chunks no greater than 1,500 words. Even though this series will probably take six or seven parts (versus my originally planned four), I think it makes the entirety more palatable. Leave a comment if you agree or disagree with anything I said, or tweet at me at @cjhoudek.\n\n-All stats and historical notes taken taken for basketball-reference.com\n\nArticle Length: ~1,200 words or about 7-10 minutes of reading.\n\nWith Klay Thompson’s concussion test coming back positive, I started thinking about injuries and how they’ve affected these playoffs. The Warriors seemed to dodge the injury bug better than any other team, but ended up losing their 6th man Marreese Speights to a calf injury (who is now questionable for game 1 of the Finals), and had two very scary moments with Stephen Curry effectively flipping through the air and Trevor Ariza Falcon-kicking Thompson in the face. If Thompson ends up being injured for the Finals, the Kevin Love injury will look more like fate meddled a bit. Why? Because, if you remember, the Warriors and Timberwolves talked about a trade involving Thompson/Lee for Love. Imagine how the NBA landscape would be different had that happened (once again, that’s what I’m here for).\n\nThe way I see it, if Love ended up with the Warriors and Thompson/Lee ended up on the Timberwolves, there are three scenarios that could have played out, all of which I’ll discuss in the coming paragraphs.\n\nScenario 1: Cavaliers still trade Anthony Bennett and Andrew Wiggins to Warriors for Kevin Love (with Thadeus Young thrown in from Philly), with Timberwolves ending up with Klay Thompson and David Lee. So the starters for the Warriors become Curry, Wiggins, Harrison Barnes, Draymond Green, and Andrew Bogut with Young, Iguodala, and Speights coming off the bench.\n\nObviously the Warriors do not become the power house that we know from this year, but their outlook for the future is interesting. First of all, a lineup including Wiggins, Iguodala, Green, and Bogut would be absolutely stifling on defense, possibly the best defensive lineup we’ve seen since the mid-2000s Pistons. We knew Wiggins was a tremendous defender in college, but now after he has completed his rookie year, we know he has a tremendous offensive game as well. He wouldn’t be able to fill Thompson’s shoes right away, but imagine his potential in that two spot. How far would he and Curry be able to pull that team in a couple years? I think they’d definitely be contenders again.\n\nThe Timberwolves would restart with Thompson and Lee leading their roster, which would finally give Thompson the chance to prove that he’s a franchise player in his own right….whichI don’t believe he is. Sure, I could see him averaging about 28 points per game on a train-wreck of a team, but this last year’s team with Thompson and Lee would still not make the playoffs, particularly in the West. In this scenario, unless otherwise traded, Thompson’s prime is pretty much completely wasted.\n\nThe Cavs stand as we know them now, so they would still make the finals, but against who? The Rockets? The Thunder after sneaking into the 8th spot (since the Warriors don’t make the playoffs)? Maybe the Grizzlies?\n\nScenario 2: Cavaliers still trade with the Timberwolves, but this time send Wiggins and Bennett for Thompson and Lee. The Warriors end up with Curry, Iguodala, Green, Love, and Bogut in their starting lineup, with Barnes (who comes off the bench so Iggy can play the two) and Speights coming off the bench.\n\nHere Love gets to play with the rim-protector he never had, but the needs to space the floor like Green did for them during the year. From the Cavaliers past season, we know that Love can fill that position, but his low-post talents are wasted by turning him into an expensive Ryan Anderson. The team obviously would still have a load of offensive and defensive fire-power, but I think this would be the Warriors worst-case scenario. Iguodala is going to be losing a few steps in the coming years, and Love cannot fulfil the shooting Thompson provided them. They’d definitely make the playoffs, but not with 67 wins.\n\nThe Cavaliers end up with a starting lineup of Irving, (Klay) Thompson, James, (Tristan) Thompson, and Mozgov with Smith, Shumpert, and Dellavedova coming off the bench. Dear sweet God look at that team. If Klay shot 44% from the three this year for the Warriors, imagine him with LeBron running the offense. Even if he misses, the poor man’s Rodman (the other Thompson) would just clean up the mess. Sure, Thompson may be concussed and miss a couple Finals games this year, but having the possibility of him coming back is better than Kevin Love being out for multiple months. Cavs easily become the favorites this year.\n\nThe Wolves remain as they were this year with Wiggins.\n\nScenario 3: No other trades happen after Love goes to the Warriors. Both the Warriors and Timberwolves end up as I’ve described them in the last few paragraphs, but the Cavaliers keep their two #1 picks in Wiggins and Bennett. Their starting lineup becomes Irving, Wiggins, James, (Tristan) Thompson, and Mozgov.\n\nDo they make it to the finals this year with this lineup? Possibly. After the second half of this last season, Wiggins put up some stellar numbers for the Timberwolves. Problem is that they were empty numbers: garbage points on a truly garbage team; however, there’s no denying his stellar athleticism and defensive tenacity. Bill Simmons in his The Book of Basketball claims that if Len Bias had survived his drug overdose and played in the NBA that Larry Bird would’ve used him as a plaything, tossing him alley-oop after alley-oop. Well imagine LeBron running the fast break with Wiggins next to him. Wiggins would score at least 4-6 more points per game just off dunks that LeBron served to him.\n\nI think that this would be Wiggins’s best situation for develop (this, or the Warriors) because he can focus on picking his spots on offense (with Irving and James running the show), and truly develop into a defensive stopper. Maybe even take a Scottie Pippen type role next to his offensive juggernauts. Then, after five years when LeBron turns 35 and starts slowing down, Irving will be 27 and Wiggins will be 24. Don’t tell me that’s not a perfect transition period from third fiddle and defensive-stopper to possible first option next to Irving. If you’re not excited and disappointed about this scenario not playing out, then I truly feel sorry for you.\n\nBut (and this is a huge but), the Cavs made the right choice with trading Wiggins. LeBron is nearing that time when all NBA players start to lose their abilities, and who knows if he has five more years to give. Love was a legit top 5-7 player the last few years, and anyone saying they wouldn’t pair him with LeBron is lying. I feel cheated as a fan to not see Wiggins develop next to his Jordan, but, as a business and basketball move, I understand it.\n\nSo think about this as you watch the upcoming Finals. Think about every trade that is considered every year that could affect every season from that point on. Maybe one day I’ll tell you about the time that the Thunder passed up on receiving Tyson Chandler. Maybe you’ll imagine the number of championships Durant, Westbrook, Ibaka, and Chandler would’ have won.\n\nArticle Length: ~1,000 words or about 5-8 minutes of reading.\n\nAs of tonight, the finals are set. The 53-29 Cavaliers will officially be facing the 67-15 Warriors, and, as always America will be cheering for the underdog Cava….wait what? The majority of people in America want the better team to win? Well that’s very un-American of us. I’ve never watched a movie with the tagline “A true top-dog story.” “Miracle” would’ve been far less interesting if the Russians ended up beating the Americans, and the only time we care about the underdog losing is if there’s a moral at the end of the loss. Well in the NBA, the only moral is win or pray that you don’t get traded, cut, or fired.\n\nIf the Warriors win the finals, they’ll be the first team since Jordan’s 1991 Bulls to win a championship having zero players with NBA finals experience. I don’t want a team like that winning. To me, that’s like the cocky freshman that walks into the first day of basketball practice proclaiming that he’s the shit, and then proceeds to rip apart his competition the entire season, starting every game, leading his school to a record breaking season, and then winning a state championship. Sure, they accomplished their ultimate goal, but that cocky kid didn’t learn a moment of humility.\n\nI want the cocky kid walking into that gym thinking they’re the best of all time, but leaving with his head hanging down wondering what went wrong. I want to see how far that cocky kid will push himself, how much better he can be. Steve Kerr is in his first year coaching, Draymond Green is in his second year, Klay Thompson and Stephen Curry have only been to the playoffs three times, so on and so forth. Curry has broken record after record with his shooting, crushing his playoff competition without the slightest bit of worry. I want every single one of them to go back to the drawing board. What more (if anything) can the MVP Curry add to his game? Will Draymond stay with the Warriors, or will another team offer him a max and coax him away? How long can Andrew Bogut and Shaun Livingston stay healthy? These are the questions and struggles that really push a team to the brink and reveal to us what they’re made of.\n\nSet aside your LeBron hate for a second (don’t give me that look, I know you have it) and listen to this comparison for a second. I sadly did not come up with it, but a Reddit user by the name of “steezstylo” perfectly put the series into perspective:\n\n“When you put it like that, Cavs vs GS is pretty much every highschool sports movie ever where a bunch of ragtag misfits go up against a well oiled team of prep school snobs\n\nThe Cavs have the prodigal son who messed things up but is trying to find redemption by becoming a leader, the headstrong young star who slowly learns the meaning of teamwork, the troubled badass who is trying to escape a reckless life of giving [women] the pipe…\n\nThe bowling scene where they put aside their differences at their lowest point, and bond to a musical montage of them joking around is just classic film story structure” (2015).\n\nI want that preppy sports team to feel that defeat, to go back and get their hands dirty. I want Stephen Curry to feel his inner-villain overcome him, like some budding Sith Lord.\n\nOh, you think I’m being a bit too harsh huh? Think about it, every great team and player first faced bone-crushing adversity. Michael Jordan had to lose to the Pistons two years in a row in the conference finals before making the finals. Shaq was completely waxed by Olajuwon after eliminating Jordan in his comeback. Isiah had to watch as Larry and Magic completely monopolized the 80s (who by the way are the exception to this rule because they had such a legendary, decade-long rivalry). Durant has been chasing LeBron every step of his career, unable to firmly grasp onto the best-player-in-the-league title. He lost in the finals, lost his best chance to win a title (Harden), and is coming off an injury-ridden season. Durant finally is ready to win a title. I lump Chris Paul into the same category as Durant.\n\nThen there’s LeBron who was crushed by the Spurs, moved to Miami, was collectively hated by the universe (and Skip Bayless…), then crushed by the Mavericks. He almost matched Kobe, Jordan, and Russell by almost winning three straight, but once again the Spurs (led by the third greatest player of all time, Tim Duncan) stopped him in his tracks. LeBron deserves to win his third championship after doing what 99.9% of NBA players were unable to: go to five straight finals.\n\nI guess my full point is that I appreciate players and teams that have paid their dues, teams that have gone to Hell and back in their odyssey to the finals. This is why I’ll cheer for Tim Duncan and the Spurs until the day Duncan retires. Nobody has shown such class and professionalism through such a consistent NBA tenure, and if anybody deserves to go out in a blaze of glory, it’s the Big Fundamental.\n\nSo go on, continue cheering for the perfection that has been this Golden State team. Keep telling yourself that they’ve been the underdog, that they deserve it the most, and that it’s Stephen Curry’s time. But answer me this: did you cheer for the perfection seeking Patriots back in 2008 when the Giants won the Superbowl? I didn’t think so.\n\nArticle Length: ~1,000 words or about 5-8 minutes of reading.\n\nIf you could change one thing about the NBA playoffs to make them even more wild, fun, and unpredictable, what would it be? If your answer was anything except that the winning team in each series gets to pick one player from the opposing team, then you’re wrong. Just imagine it for a second, but not too much because I’m about to do that for you more in depth.\n\nBefore walking through this year’s playoffs with this wrinkle in mind, I need to establish a few ground rules so that too many superstars don’t end up on the same team, ultimately ruining team chemistry. So, once a team wins a series, they have the option to trade one of their starters for one of their opponents’ starters, or one of their bench players for an opponent’s bench player. Now, just so we don’t get situations where the Cavaliers would dump Joe Harris for someone like Jamal Crawford, the bench player the winning team trades has to have been averaging at least 10 minutes per game through the playoffs. Sound fair?\n\nI’m going to split this article into a few different sections so as to not post a novel. I’ll begin with the first round of the Western Conference.\n\nThe Warriors and Pelicans matched up in the first round, with the Warriors sweeping the Anthony Davis’ fairly easily (if you count a 20-point comeback as easy). I’m a big advocate for team chemistry and building cohesiveness, but in this case, I think the Warriors would be making a huge mistake by passing on Anthony Davis (wow Cody, what a brave claim). In their starting lineup, Curry is absolutely untouchable with Draymond Green and Klay Thompson being the next tier. That leaves Andrew Bogut and Harrison Barnes for trading. I’d definitely trade Barnes away to insert Davis at the power forward position, and shift Green down to small forward. That to me sound like a completely unbeatable starting lineup, especially considering that the Warriors love to play small-ball, where Davis could shift to center and still provide them shot blocking and a post presence.\n\nNext was the Rockets/Mavericks series, with the Mavericks falling victim to a Rondo explosion, a Josh Smith/Dwight Howard connection, and a Parsons injury. The Rockets could go any number of directions, especially after their injury-ridden season. Them making the conference finals with D-Mo or Pat Beverley is truly a testament to how good of a team that is. During the first round, The Rockets started Terry, Harden, Ariza, Jones, and Howard. Harden is obviously untouchable, and Howard looks like he remembered dragging his Magic team to the finals in 2009, blocking shots and grabbing rebounds like his life depended on it. He’s untouchable as well. Ariza plays D, runs the floor, and shoots threes just like he needs to. Jones has been impressive on the offensive end, but his defensive leaves a lot to be desired. Terry is but a shell of himself (granted, he shot 47% from the three, but definitely not providing the necessary defense). Still, Harden could use more help scoring the ball, which is why I’d swap Terry for Monta Ellis. Sure, he has quite the reputation for being a bit of a black hole, but since joining the Mavericks, he’s played the best team ball he ever has. I want that Ellis on my team.\n\nThe next matchup was the Spurs and Clipper, which rates up there as possibly the greatest first round matchup in the history of the NBA (competing closely with the 2009 Bulls/Celtics matchup where four of the seven games went to overtime, including a double overtime and a triple overtime game). Now, the Clippers are in desperate need of a useful bench, one that would allow their threesome of Paul, Griffin, and Jordan to rest a bit. But Manu Ginobili had an underwhelming series, especially in comparison to what he’s been capable of. Marco Belinelli would be a great addition off the bench, but the Clipper cannot and would not pass up on trading Matt Barnes for Kawhi Leonard (which would be the second Barnes traded in the first round. Coincidence? Sounds like a Barnes-burning…). It physically pains me to not trade for Tim Duncan. He just received his fifteenth All-NBA award and All-Defensive award, and completely took Jordan and Griffin to task. But having a fourth option on the wing in Kawhi, plus, ya know, he’s the defensive player of the year, would be particularly helpful.\n\nThe final first round matchup was the Blazers and the Grizzlies. This is by far the most difficult first-round trade choice of the western conference. The Blazers have two excellent players to steal in Aldridge and Lillard, but are they excellent enough? Can Aldridge replace either Z-Bo or Gasol, and can Lillard replace Conley? In short: no they cannot. The Grizzlies are built off pounding defensive force, something both Lillard and Aldridge would struggle at; however, can one make the argument that Aldridge could’ve made them more effective than Randolph? Randolph is the heart and soul of the Grizzlies team, the large, unathletic, skilled monster who makes skinnier post players pay. If the Blazers offered the Grizzlies Aldridge for Randolph straight up, they’d take it with no hesitation. I played with the idea of trading Vince Carter for CJ McCollum, and still something deep inside of me feels like the Grizzlies are leaving something on the table with Aldridge, even though he was playing through an injury. He’s still a legitimate 20-10 threat every single night, and with the post-wizardry of Gasol, he’d get plenty of more open looks. I think the Grizz have to take Aldridge, even if it means sacrificing Randolph.\n\nSo those are the four changes moving into the second round of the Western conference: Anthony Davis on the Warriors for Harrison Barnes; Monta Ellis to the Rockets for Jason Terry; Kawhi Leonard to the Clippers for Matt Barnes; finally, LaMarcus Aldridge to the Grizzlies for Zach Randolph.\n\nNext time, I’ll move on to the first round of the Eastern conference before tackling the conference semifinals."
