        "text": "PLAYA VISTA — Jamal Crawford stood inside the Los Angeles Clippers’ practice facility wearing a smile, like he usually does. The smile stayed even when asked what his approach to defense had been before Doc Rivers arrived for the 2013-14 season to coach the Clippers.\n\n“Offense was my defense,” said Crawford, a career-long scoring machine who can knock down a fall-away 3-pointer while being fouled and convert it into a four-point play with the best. “I figured I was one of the best offensive players and I could outscore the guy I’m guarding.\n\n“That, honestly, was my mentality.”\n\nNot anymore. Crawford, a two-time Sixth Man of the Year award winner – he won it in 2009-10 and 2013-14 – has a new attitude about defense that began in ‘13-’14.\n\n“Now I look at it differently,” Crawford said. “I look at it like, I take pride in it. I take pride on if I’m in the wrong spot. I take pride in if I make a defensive mistake, because I care. I want to be a better all-around player and I want to help this team.\n\n“And I think I can help it more than just scoring.”\n\nRivers apparently had a lot to do with this metamorphosis of sorts.\n\n“Doc and his system; he helped me look at basketball differently,” Crawford said.\n\nCrawford, 34, is in his 15th season, third with the Clippers. A 3-point-basket-making fool, he is No. 10 all-time with 1,739 and figures to climb at least two more rungs on that ladder this season. He has a career scoring average of 15.6 and averaged 16.5 points and 18.6, respectively, his first two seasons with the Clippers; he’s averaging 16.7 this season.\n\nIndeed, the man can score. Some of the long-distance shots are crazy deep. He makes them when he’s off-balance, or when a defender is in his face. Now, he’s trying to be that lock-down defender even though most foes can’t lock him down.\n\nHis teammates see it, and appreciate it.\n\n“I think just the pride that he takes in his defense,” point guard Chris Paul said, when asked what he has noticed in Crawford’s play in that regard. “Jamal’s been in this league a long time and everybody knows how he scores the ball and he’s unguardable.\n\n“And I think he’s just made a concerted effort to just defend, and it’s huge for our team.”\n\nPaul is a terrific defensive player, so that means a lot coming from him. Post DeAndre Jordan – a sensational defender – also gives Crawford rave reviews.\n\n“Yeah, Jamal can just outscore anybody, so nobody can outscore Jamal Crawford; nobody,” Jordan said. “But he’s definitely taken pride a lot the last two years that we’ve played together on giving a conscious effort of being in the right spot, wanting to guard a guy, not wanting as much help, not relying on as much help as he did before.\n\n“You can see it in practice and in games, that he really is focused on defense and getting a stop, so it’s good.”\n\nRivers believes Crawford has turned a corner in his defensive play. But like most coaches with their players, he wants to get as much out of Crawford as he can, so he’s not going to label him a splendid defender just yet.\n\n“Yeah, I think his team defense has been great,” Rivers said. “You have to remind him some about the individual defense, but I think he absolutely knows it. He wants to do it, he wants to do it right. That’s all you can ask. … He’s been good.”\n\nThat will be music to Crawford’s ears.\n\n“Just being a winning player, you want to do everything,” Crawford said. “You don’t want to be labeled as just something. I mean, I’m always going to be a scorer because that’s who I am. But if I can be solid or pretty good on defense, that’s good.”\n\nIt would be easy, maybe even understandable, for Crawford to rest on his laurels. But that’s not him.\n\n“I don’t want to be an age number, where people say, ‘You’re a certain age, you can’t improve,’ “ he said. “I want to keep getting better until I’m no longer in the NBA.”\n\nNothing wrong with a little progressive thinking.\n\nCRAWFORD FILE\n\nHeight: 6-foot-5\n\nPostion: Small forward/sixth-man\n\nAge: 34\n\nBorn: Seattle, Wash.\n\nScoring average in 2014-15: 16.7\n\n3-pointers: 1,739, No. 10 all-time"
