        "text": "American basketball player (born 1990)\n\nFor the tennis player, see Clay Thompson.\n\nKlay Alexander Thompson (born February 8, 1990)[1] is an American professional basketball player for the Dallas Mavericks of the National Basketball Association (NBA). He played his first 13 seasons with the Golden State Warriors, where Thompson was part of the Splash Brothers. He is widely regarded as one of the greatest three-point shooters of all-time.[2][3][4] Thompson is a four-time NBA champion, a five-time NBA All-Star, a two-time All-NBA Third Team honoree, and was once named to the NBA All-Defensive Second Team. He has also won gold medals with the United States national team on their 2014 World Cup team and 2016 Olympic team.\n\nThe son of former NBA player Mychal Thompson, Klay Thompson played college basketball for three seasons with the Washington State Cougars, where he was a two-time first-team all-conference selection in the Pac-10 (now Pac-12). Thompson was selected in the first round of the 2011 NBA draft by Golden State with the 11th overall pick. In 2014, he and teammate Stephen Curry set a then-NBA record with 484 combined three-pointers in a season (a record they broke the following season with 525 and again in the 2015–16 season with 678),[5] earning the pair the nickname of \"the Splash Brothers.\"[6][7] In 2015, Thompson helped lead the Warriors to their first NBA championship since 1975. The following season, he helped the Warriors win a record 73 games. The team advanced to the NBA Finals that season, losing to the Cleveland Cavaliers in seven games. Thompson and the Warriors avenged their 2016 finals loss, winning two more titles in 2017 and 2018. He also helped the Warriors reach their fifth straight Finals in 2019, where he suffered a torn ACL late in the series. After missing over two and a half years of play due to injury, Thompson returned in the middle of the 2021–22 season,[8] where he won his fourth title in 2022.\n\nEarly life\n\nThompson was born in Los Angeles to Julie and Mychal Thompson. His mother was a volleyball player in college for the University of Portland and University of San Francisco, while his father was the first overall pick of the 1978 NBA draft.[9] When Thompson was two, he and his family moved to Lake Oswego, Oregon, where Thompson was childhood friends and Little League teammates with fellow future NBA star Kevin Love.[10] Thompson and his brothers were raised there as Catholics.[11]\n\nWhen Thompson was 14, his family moved to Ladera Ranch, California, where he graduated from Santa Margarita Catholic High School in Rancho Santa Margarita in 2008.[1] In his junior season, Thompson was named to the All-Area second team and to the Orange County third team.[citation needed] As a senior, Thompson averaged 21 points per game and led SMCHS to a 30–5 record and a Division III State Championship appearance.[1][12] During the state championship, Thompson set a state finals record with seven three-pointers in a game.[12] He was named Division III State player of the year, League MVP, first-team Best in the West, and an EA Sports Second Team All American.[1]\n\nUS college sports recruiting information for high school athletes Name Hometown High school / college Height Weight Commit date Klay Thompson\n\nSG Rancho Santa Margarita, California Santa Margarita Catholic High 6 ft 5 in (1.96 m) 185 lb (84 kg) Oct 2, 2007 Recruiting star ratings: Scout: Rivals: 247Sports: ESPN grade: 95 Overall recruiting rankings: Scout: 45 Rivals: 6 (SG); 51 (national)\n\nNote: In many cases, Scout, Rivals, 247Sports, and ESPN may conflict in their listings of height and weight.\n\nIn these cases, the average was taken.

Thompson was named to the Pac-10 All-Freshman Team and Collegehoops.net All-Freshman Honorable Mention Team.\n\nThompson began his sophomore season by leading the Cougars to the Great Alaska Shootout Championship, being named its Most Outstanding Player after scoring a tournament single game record of 43 points in its championship.[1][13] This was also the third highest single game point total in WSU history.[1] After becoming the third fastest Cougar to reach 1,000 points, Thompson was named to the All-Pac-10 First Team.[1][14] He earned Pac-10 Player of the Week honors twice during the season and was chosen as a midseason candidate for the John R. Wooden Award.[1][15] Thompson finished the season averaging 19.6 points, good for second in the conference.[1]\n\nThompson led the Pac-10 in scoring as a junior, again earning All-Pac-10 first team honors.[16][17] He became just the third Cougar to win first-team all-district honors from the National Association of Basketball Coaches twice in his career.[16] Thompson also became the first Cougar to be named Pac-10 Player of the Week three times when he won the award for the week of Nov. 22–28,[18] extending the record to four after the week of December 6–12.[19] Soon after, Thompson was named one of the 30 midseason candidates for the John R.

He became the second WSU men's basketball player to receive this honor, joining Steve Puidokas, and the seventh WSU athlete in any sport whose number has been retired.[23]\n\nProfessional career\n\nGolden State Warriors (2011–2024)\n\nEarly years (2011–2014)\n\nThompson declared for the 2011 NBA draft after his junior season, being selected 11th overall by the Golden State Warriors.[22] This pick of a guard prompted speculation that the Warriors would trade starter Monta Ellis, but that did not occur until March 2012.[24] Warriors general manager Larry Riley praised Thompson for his shooting ability and expressed confidence that Thompson would improve his defensive skills with new coach Mark Jackson.[24]\n\nThe NBA did not select Thompson for the 2012 NBA All-Star Weekend Rising Stars Challenge. However, in the four games after that decision, Thompson improved in all areas of basketball over his then-current season averages: points per game (12.5 over 7.6), shooting percentage (54.3% overall including 55.6% for three-pointers, up from 46.7 and 48.1), rebounds (2.8 from 1.6), assists (1.5 from 1.3), steals, and turnovers.[25] The Warriors traded Ellis to the Milwaukee Bucks on March 13, 2012.[26] The following game, Thompson scored a season-high 26 points in a loss to the Boston Celtics.[27] A week later, he exceeded his previous high with 27 points in a win over the New Orleans Hornets.[28] As of mid-February 2012, Thompson played around 17 minutes per game,[25] but he played an average 30 minutes per game during the next month.[29] At the end of the season, Thompson was voted to the NBA NBA All-Rookie First Team.\n\nOn January 29, 2013, Thompson scored a season-high 32 points against the Cleveland Cavaliers.[30] Warriors coach Mark Jackson said that Thompson and Stephen Curry formed the best shooting duo in NBA history.[31] That season, they combined made 483 three-pointers, the most ever by an NBA duo at the time.[a][33] The Warriors defeated the Denver Nuggets in the first round of the playoffs and were next matched up against the San Antonio Spurs.

In the third quarter of that game, he scored an NBA-record 37 points for a single quarter, going 13-for-13 from the field, including nine three-pointers (also a league record for a single quarter). The 13 field goals tied David Thompson's (no relation) record for a quarter.[b][38][39][40] On January 29, 2015, Thompson was named a reserve for the 2015 Western Conference All-Star team for the first time in his career.[41]\n\nOn March 8, 2015, Thompson hit three three-pointers against the Los Angeles Clippers to pass head coach Steve Kerr (726) on the NBA's all-time list.[42] On March 17, he was ruled out for 7–10 days with a sprained ankle.[43] That season, Curry broke his own record for three-pointers (286), and Thompson again finished second in the league (239) as the two combined to make 525 threes, surpassing their previous record by 41. On June 7, in Game 2 of the NBA Finals, Thompson scored a playoff career-high 34 points in a 95–93 overtime loss to the Cleveland Cavaliers.[44][45] The Warriors went on to defeat the Cavaliers in six games to win the NBA championship and end the franchise's 40-year championship drought.\n\nFinals upset (2015–2016)\n\nThompson opened the first seven games of the 2015–16 season shooting only 13-of-36 from 3-point range (36 percent). In the last 11 games of November, Thompson then shot a combined 32-of-73 from beyond the arc (43.8 percent).[46] The Warriors' NBA-record start ended at 24 wins when they lost to the Milwaukee Bucks on December 12.[47] In the Warriors' next game, on December 16, Thompson scored 27 of his then season-high 43 points in the third quarter of their 128–103 win over the Phoenix Suns.[48] On January 8, he recorded his third consecutive game with 30 or more points, finishing with 36 points in a 128–108 win over the Portland Trail Blazers.[49] On January 27, he scored a season-high 45 points on 14-of-20 shooting in a 127–107 win over the Dallas Mavericks.[50] The following night, he was named a Western Conference All-Star reserve for the 2016 NBA All-Star Game, earning his second straight All-Star nod.[51] On February 13, he competed in the All-Star Weekend's Three-Point Contest and won the event after defeating Curry and Devin Booker in the final round.[52] On March 25, he scored 40 points against the Dallas Mavericks. Two days later, he had another 40-point game against the Philadelphia 76ers, scoring 40 points in consecutive games for the first time in his career.[53] On April 7, Thompson scored 14 points against the San Antonio Spurs, helping the Warriors become the second team in NBA history to win 70 games in a season.[54]\n\nAs the No. 1 seed in the Western Conference, the Warriors faced the eighth-seeded Houston Rockets in the first round of the playoffs. In Game 5 of the series, Thompson became the first player in NBA history to make at least seven three-pointers in consecutive playoff games, as he helped the Warriors advance through to the second round with a 4–1 victory, stepping up with Curry out injured.[55] The Warriors went on to defeat the Portland Trail Blazers 4–1 in the second round, moving on to the Western Conference Finals where they faced the Oklahoma City Thunder. After being down 3–1 following a Game 4 loss, Thompson helped the Warriors rally in Games 5 and 6 to even the series at 3–3. In Game 6, Thompson made 11 three-pointers[c] and scored 41 points, as the Warriors forced a Game 7 with a 108–101 victory.[57] With a Game 7 96–88 victory, the Warriors became the tenth team to rally from a 3–1 deficit and win a postseason series.[58] The Warriors went on to lose to the Cleveland Cavaliers in the 2016 NBA Finals in seven games, despite being up 3–1 in the series.[59]\n\nSecond NBA championship (2016–2017)\n\nThompson opened the first six games of the 2016–17 season shooting 11-of-53 from 3-point range (20.75 percent). In the last 11 games of November, he then went a combined 39-of-84 from three-point range (46.4 percent).[46] On December 5, 2016, Thompson scored 60 points (shooting 21-of-33 and 8-of-14 on three-pointers) in 29 minutes over just three quarters in a 142–106 victory over the Indiana Pacers,[60] becoming the first player in NBA history to score 60 points in less than 30 minutes of action.[61] Thompson had an NBA season-high and career-best performance for the highest-scoring output by a Warriors player in mhan 42 years. His 40 first-half points tied him for second-most scored in a half over the past decade. Thompson also became the first Warrior to score 60 points since Hall of Famer Rick Barry's 64 on March 26, 1974, joining Barry and Naismith honorees Wilt Chamberlain and Joe Fulks as the only Warriors players to do so.[62] On January 26, he was named a Western Conference All-Star reserve for the 2017 NBA All-Star Game.[63] He participated in the Three-Point Contest, but he failed to defend his title as he was eliminated in the first round. On April 4, 2017, he scored 41 points (his 10th career 40-point game) in a 121–107 victory over the Minnesota Timberwolves.[64] The Warriors finished the season as the first seed in the West with a 67–15 record.[65]\n\nThompson struggled with his shooting for extended stretches during the playoffs, but his defense against opposing guards like Damian Lillard, Patty Mills, and Kyrie Irving stood out.[66] Following a 129–115 victory in Game 4 of the Western Conference Finals over the San Antonio Spurs, the Warriors reached their third straight NBA Finals series, becoming the first team in league history to start the playoffs 12–0.[67] Thompson helped the Warriors win their second championship in three years with a 4–1 series win over the Cleveland Cavaliers in the 2017 NBA Finals. The Warriors finished the playoffs with a 16–1 record, the best postseason winning percentage in NBA history.[68]\n\nThird NBA championship (2017–2018)\n\nOn October 29, 2017, Thompson scored 29 points in a 115–107 loss to the Detroit Pistons, becoming the eleventh player in franchise history to eclipse 9,000 career points.[69] On December 20, 2017, he scored 27 of his 29 points in the first half and made his first nine field goals in a 97–84 victory over the Memphis Grizzlies.[70] On December 27, 2017, in a 126–101 win over the Utah Jazz, Thompson hit three three-pointers, moving him into a tie for third with Dana Barros at 89 consecutive games with a three-pointer.[71] On January 17, 2018, he scored 38 points in a 119–112 victory over the Chicago Bulls.[72] In a 134–127 victory over the Los Angeles Clippers on February 22, 2018, Thompson moved past Joe Barry Carroll's 9,996 points to earn tenth place on the franchise's career scoring list, also becoming the tenth Warrior to reach 10,000 regular season career points.[73] Two days later, in a 112–80 victory over the Thunder, Thompson passed Neil Johnston (10,023) for ninth place on the franchise's career scoring list.[74] On March 31, 2018, following an eight-game absence with a broken right thumb, Thompson scored 25 points on 10-for-19 shooting in a 112–96 victory over the Sacramento Kings.[75] On April 5, 2018, in a 126–106 loss to the Indiana Pacers, Thompson was 4-of-9 on 3-pointers to move past Tim Hardaway (1,542) for 25th on the league's career list.[76] Three days later, Thompson scored 22 of his 34 points in the first quarter of the Warriors' 117–100 win over the Phoenix Suns.[77] He helped the Warriors defeat the San Antonio Spurs in the first round of the playoffs in five games, as he scored 24 points in a 99–91 victory in Game 5. As a result, Thompson joined Rick Barry (699) and Curry (652) as Warriors players with 600 postseason field goals.[78] In Game 3 of the Western Conference Finals against the Houston Rockets, Thompson moved past Barry (1,776) for second place on the Warriors' career postseason scoring list.[79] In Game 6, Thompson knocked down nine three-pointers on his way to 35 points, as the Warriors rallied from an early 17-point deficit to stave off elimination with a 115–86 victory over the Rockets.[80] In Game 2 of the NBA Finals, Thompson played in his franchise-record 100th postseason game.
