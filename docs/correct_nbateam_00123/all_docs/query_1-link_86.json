        "text": "Phoenix Suns superstar forward Kevin Durant has had a complicated legacy over the past eight seasons.\n\nIt all stems from his decision to sign with the Golden State Warriors in free agency after the 2015-16 season, after he and his then-Oklahoma City Thunder teammates blew a 3-1 series lead to the Warriors in the Western Conference Finals.\n\nMany thought it was a soft move to theoretically \"run\" from the competition. Many thought it was a genius move to take his talents to a team that would surround him with the type of talent that should translate to consistent NBA titles.\n\nSure enough, Durant played three seasons with Golden State — winning two NBA championships and two NBA Finals MVPs in his first two seasons with the team. He also went to the NBA Finals in his third year.\n\nSome who were not in favor of his move to Golden State have since discredited his titles and finals MVPs, at least to an extent. JJ Redick, the former 15-year NBA veteran and current ESPN NBA analyst, recently discussed this complicated legacy with Durant's current teammate, Suns' guard Devin Booker, on Redick's podcast, \"The Old Man & the Three.\"\n\n\"We're gonna look back in like, 10 or 15 years, and be like, 'Why did we spend all this time with all the discourse and not just appreciate literally one of the greatest basketball players to ever play this game?'\" Redick said. \"He's literally one of the greatest players ever, and we spend too much time just on the (expletive), instead of just appreciating his night-to-night greatness.\"\n\nRegardless of whether those who question the legitimacy of Durant's runs with Golden State, where he joined a team returning three All-NBA players from the season prior, are correct or not, Redick has an argument. There are some things Durant has done on the basketball court that cannot be questioned — his NBA MVP award, his 10 All-NBA selections (six first-team) and his 14 All-Star selections. Then again, perhaps him achieving those awards suggests that he is indeed appreciated plenty, as all of those awards are voted on by the media, fans and NBA players.\n\nHowever, Kendrick Perkins, another 14-year NBA veteran who once played with Durant and now is Redick's ESPN colleague, lit Redick up for his take on Durant not being appreciated enough.\n\n\"It was a reach, and (Redick's) wrong,\" Perkins said on ESPN's \"Get Up\" on Friday. \"First of all, KD doesn't even fit in that box. We're talking about an all-time great. Guys have acknowledged that right now, KD is a top-20 all-time great. That's not being underappreciated. Kevin Durant started in the All-Star game. That's not being underappreciated by fans.\"\n\nPerhaps Redick believes Durant should be considered better than \"a top-20 all-time great.\" He might see a guy who is currently ninth all-time in scoring, while also averaging over a steal and over a block per game over the course of his career.\n\nDurant and Perkins have traded barbs since Perkins entered the media, although it is not clear if Perkins' take is at all related to those differences. Perkins spoke highly of Durant's game this season and raved about his status as an all-time great scorer in his ESPN rant Friday morning.\n\n\"And so when you think about KD, I have him as arguably the greatest scorer to ever touch the damn basketball, and I've said that on many occasions,\" Perkins said. \"I done heard Jamal Crawford — one of the most skilled guys to ever touch the basketball say that Kevin Durant is the best basketball player in the world. I heard Stephen A. (Smith) say that Kevin Durant is the best player in the world. ... When it comes down to Kevin Durant, nobody is underappreciating him. Matter of fact, we give him his flowers all of the time. That was a horrible take by JJ Redick.\"\n\nDurant has not lost a step in his NBA career. He is currently averaging 28.3 points, 6.6 rebounds, 5.4 assists per game and 1.3 blocks per game. This is despite being in his 16th NBA season and being 35 years old. He is shooting 52.8% from the field, 42.4% from three and 85.2% from the free-throw line on the year.\n\nOne thing Durant can do that would certainly be appreciated, would be to win an NBA title this season. He did not join a 73-9 team when he was traded to the Suns last year, as opposed to when he joined the Warriors in 2016. He was traded to a banged-up squad that had just collapsed in the second round of the postseason the year prior despite leading the league with 64 wins, and a franchise that is yet to win an NBA title.\n\nCurrently sitting in seventh place in the West, the 39-28 Suns have not performed like a team that will accomplish that feat this postseason. That being said, the team is no longer banged up, and will have the chance to prove to be a contender for the last 15 games. They are currently 2-1 in their last three games; which is notable because that marks their most recent streak of games that their Big 3 of Durant, Booker and Bradley Beal have all been healthy at the same time."
