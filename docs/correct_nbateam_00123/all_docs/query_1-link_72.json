        "text": "The NBA is back in Seattle. For this summer, at least. The Jamal Crawford Summer Pro-Am league gathers some of the area's best professional basketball talent and showcases it for everyone to see in a fun, relaxed and exciting environment.\n\nThe Sonics are long gone, and this is by no means a replacement for an NBA team, but basketball junkies have a chance to see hometown NBA talent play in a semi-competitive environment. In the past few years, players like Nate Robinson and Terrence Williams have taken these games seriously, especially in the fourth quarter.\n\nThis is also a chance for local basketball fans to see some former high school and college standouts that play overseas or do not play professionally anymore - former UW stars Tre Simmons, Will Conroy and Mike Jensen will all be playing in the league this summer.\n\nGames run every weekend on Saturdays and Sundays at Rainier Vista Boys and Girls Club in south Seattle. Tipoff times are at 1:30 p.m., 3:00 p.m., and 4:30 p.m.. Admission is $5 for all three games with those 17 years old and younger having free admission. Follow @JCrawfordProAm on Twitter for more information.\n\nBelow are tentative rosters for this summer per the league's Facebook page. Note that these rosters are often fluid and usually will change as is the nature of a laid back summer league. Next to every player's name I have included their respective basketball affiliations. I was not able to gather information on every single player, so if you can help me out please drop a comment in the thread below.

Several players have played for the Bellingham Slam or Olympia Reign in the International Basketball League. A handful of players have found their way onto the Seattle Mountaineers, a team in the ABA.\n\nCheck out that 76ers squad, not only do they have the best scorer in the league (Terrence Williams) but they have Garrison Carr and Tre Simmons who can light it up from the outside.\n\n.The Grizzlies should be fun to watch, former Husky Jamaal Williams has not played organized basketball in awhile, but if he can retain his low post scoring, watch out, him Brandon Roy and Micha Downs make up a solid trio.\n\nWill Dorsey and Tucker Haymond are both still in high school, but who is to say that this experience won't benefit them moving forward?\n\nThe Trailblazers are stacked with talent, Jamal Crawford and Tony Wroten make up the league's best backcourt.\n\nMIke Jensen and Hans Gasser on the same team with Will Conroy? Any fan of the early Romar teams will flock to watch their games\n\nThe talent in the league is evenly distributed, each team has at least one player with NBA experience.\n\nHighlights of last year's Pro-Am are below:"
