        "text": "Nine years ago this month, Jamal Crawford had his world rocked. The Knicks were dumping their biggest contracts, so Crawford and Zach Randolph were traded for expiring contracts.\n\nThe Warriors, still two months from getting star Monta Ellis back after his moped accident, dumped Al Harrington — a beleaguered remnant of the “We Believe” team — for Crawford’s backcourt versatility. He was coming off a career season with the Knicks, building a reputation in the “Mecca of Basketball” as a clutch combo guard. Then suddenly, he was plopped into dysfunction.\n\nAnd Crawford loved it.\n\n“This was the first place I played in the NBA where the sun woke me up,” he said in a phone interview of his time with the Warriors. “I used to always go to the Burrito Shop. Go hang out in Jack London Square at the Barnes & Noble. Get some chicken and waffles. One thing about here, the fans give it up. I can honestly say they’re not bandwagon fans. We weren’t good that season and they represented.”\n\nCrawford — now with the Minnesota Timberwolves, who play the Warriors at Oracle Arena tonight — is in his 18th NBA season, so that trade was essentially the mid-point in his career. Unbeknownst to him, he started a relationship with the Warriors, a connection that still exists today.\n\nAnyone who understands Crawford can understand why he appreciates the Warriors. It’s deeper than him having played here and lived in the Bay for seven months, falling in love before being traded to Atlanta the following offseason.\n\nCrawford is an anomaly so he can adeptly spot the anomalous. He is a basketball addict so he can’t help but enjoy the skill and greatness. He is an old-school competitor so he respects the Goliath they represent.\n\nAll of that factored in this past offseason when, behind the scenes, the possibility of coming to the Warriors came up.\n\n“To be honest, I’m not sure how much interest they had,” Crawford said. “If I came to the Warriors, I’d be just a spoke in the wheel. I wanted to go somewhere that hasn’t won. If I were on my last year and wanted to experience a championship, maybe it would be different. But I feel like I’ve got years left. I want to go through that journey with these guys (in Minnesota).”\n\nYou’ve got to remember, Crawford is from a different generation of basketball. He began his career with the Bulls in 2000-01 after being drafted No. 8 overall out of Michigan by Cleveland and traded to Chicago for big man Chris Mihm. While he was at Rainier Beach High in Seattle, and regarded as one of the top prep point guards in the country while giving pros the business in pickup games, the Bulls were capping off their dominant stretch. When he arrived in the NBA, the Lakers were beginning theirs. He was making the Sixth Man Award cool again while the Heat dynasty was ruling.\n\nCrawford has seen the NBA evolve, and made the adjustment like few have. His purview of the Warriors isn’t reactionary but filtered through an algorithm he’s been developing for decades.\n\n“They do everything the right way,” said Crawford, who in his last 20 games against the Warriors has averaged 18.1 points. “They care about each other. I was definitely watching. From a distance but also up close because I played with the Clippers and the rivalry we had. You could see it. No egos. Playing for each other. On and off the court, they do things the right way. Who wouldn’t want to play for them?”\n\nNo doubt, Crawford’s perspective on this era’s great team is shaped by living through the Warriors-Clippers rivalry. He was on the Clippers when they owned the Warriors. His 22 points off the bench hurt the Warriors in Game 7 of their first-round playoff series in 2014.\n\nHe is of the firm belief that the Clippers were, at one point, at least as talented as the Warriors. He’d probably lean towards more talented. But after five seasons with the Clippers, he is clear on why the Warriors supplanted their rivals in the Western Conference and became champions.\n\n“The Warriors weren’t only the best team, but they were the best team,” Crawford said, emphasizing their cohesiveness and chemistry. “They never splintered. They stayed together. They handled the moment. You gotta have that. When adversity hits, it doesn’t build character, it reveals it. We didn’t handle it well. And then, at the wrong time, we had injuries. So some of it was self-inflicted, some of it was bad luck. In that five years I was there, we won the third- or fourth-most games. We were right there in a lot of different ways, and in some ways we weren’t.”\n\nThe lessons he learned with the Clippers, while being leapfrogged by the Warriors, Crawford is sharing with the Timberwolves. He’s back in position to try to dethrone the Warriors.\n\nWhile especially personable, Crawford is usually low-key and understated. But he said with Minnesota, a young team seeking to be great, he’s speaking up like he never has before.\n\nThe Clippers had domineering personalities in their locker room, namely Chris Paul and Blake Griffin and coach Doc Rivers, relegating Crawford to the background. His input was only given when solicited, and that was rare. But he’s seen too much to let the Timberwolves make the same mistakes, develop similar destructive habits, and not at least try to prevent it.\n\nCrawford’s presence with the Timberwolves is more than buckets off the bench. It’s building something special. It’s about having a fulfilling and impactful twilight to his career.\n\n“Our team is so young,” Crawford said. “Even Jimmy (Butler), our best player, is 28. And that’s cool. I’ve seen what it’s like being a young team on the rise. I know how I handled that before and how I can help this time.”\n\nWhat’s immediately striking about the 37-year-old Crawford is the absence of bitterness. He explains things with the wisdom of an elder statesman. He talks about basketball like one who hovers over the current era, able to see how it fits into the storyline of NBA history. Part of that is because of how amazing his career has been.\n\nCrawford was schooled in an era where a guard’s worth was defined by his ability to create buckets. Period. But the years have taught him there is so much more that goes into being great.\n\nOpportunity. Coaching. Discipline. Confidence. Scheme.\n\nTalent is just the beginning. And that’s why Crawford looks back on a career with no championships and no All-Stars (but three Sixth Man of the Year awards) with pride.\n\nTo be sure, he’s made more than $104 million in the NBA, with plans on playing more years, so he has plenty reason to not be bitter. And he’s one of those athletes who’s developed a complex about protecting his money after so many before him squandered their riches. But even grasping that into context is not a given.\n\nStill, 18 years in, Crawford speaks about his career with awe because of how improbable it has been.\n\nHe played for three high schools in five years. He played 17 games at Michigan and was suspended twice before declaring for the draft after one year of college. In his early days, he was regarded as a knucklehead whose game exemplified what was wrong with the NBA.\n\nThen, in the middle of his prime, while he could still go get 25 points at will, he accepted a role off the bench. In half of his games as a Warrior, Crawford scored 25 or more, including a 40-point game and a 50-point game. Months later, he was coming off the bench for the Hawks.\n\nHe’s had 18 coaches in his 18 seasons. Throw in high school and college, that’s 20 coaches his last 20 years of basketball. And he has yet to have a coach, a system, really centered on elevating his game. The most time he spent with one coach came with the Clippers, and there he was confined to the coach’s periphery.\n\nThe story of his career has not become about what he didn’t do, or couldn’t do, but about all he was able to pull off. In the annals of basketball history, Crawford has somehow managed to forge a career and reputation unlike any other. That truth colors his assessment.\n\nIt’s why he still watches NBA League Pass like an addict, so much so he had to make trade-offs with his wife. It’s why the day before the first game this season brought Christmas Eve-type excitement.\n\nThe surreal hasn’t worn off.\n\n“Magic Johnson knows who I am. Isiah Thomas likes my game,” Crawford said. “That’s still crazy to me. When I was coming up, Michael Jordan was so farfetched that he wasn’t even real. I was just with Jordan this summer. I’m just a kid from Seattle. Imagine that.”\n\nThat’s the perspective that paints his vision of the Warriors. Greatness is a mountain meant to be scaled. It is also meant to be appreciated.\n\nEras like these, teams like this, don’t come around too often. Crawford understands that as much as anybody — which is why he relishes the challenge of taking them down.\n\n“It’s unbelievable, the effect they are having on the younger generation,” Crawford said. “I’m in the gyms. My son is 7. I see the 8- and 9-year-olds. They’ve kind of become — and don’t take this the wrong way — this generation’s version of the Bulls. They aren’t the Bulls but they’ve swept the country the same way the Bulls did, the same way the Lakers swept the country. And that’s great for basketball.”\n\nSpoken like a true elder statesman.\n\n(Top photo by Zhong Zhi/Getty Images)"
