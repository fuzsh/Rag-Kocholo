        "text": "Jamal Crawford and Quentin Richardson return for a new stream of NBA HooperVision on NBA League Pass. The duo will give their unique perspectives on Thursday’s game between the Memphis Grizzlies and Golden State Warriors at 10 p.m. ET., taking fans inside the life of an NBA player by sharing stories from their careers and providing in-depth analysis.\n\nThe Grizzlies (19-13) are coming off a narrow 102-99 loss to the Thunder, but the good news is that star point guard Ja Morant returned after a 12-game absence. Memphis hardly missed a beat, going 10-2 in that span, with Desmond Bane, Dillon Brooks and Jaren Jackson Jr. picking up the scoring slack. Bench production has been a weakness for the Grizz, highlighted by OKC’s 37-21 edge in bench scoring in Monday’s loss.\n\nThe Warriors (25-6) own the league’s best home record and improved to 15-2 at Chase Center after Monday’s 113-98 win over the Kings. Steph Curry, fresh off becoming the all-time 3-point king, dropped 15 of his 30 points in the final frame. Golden State’s improved depth was evident thanks to 42 points contributed by the trio of Gary Payton II, Otto Porter Jr. and Damion Lee. Draymond Green, the Dubs’ defensive anchor all season, posted a triple-double to continue his fine all-around season.\n\nIf you’re new to League Pass, unlock your 7-day free trial now. Upon logging into your League Pass subscription, you’ll be able to find the alternate stream with Crawford and Richardson on the game page for Grizzlies-Warriors within the “Watch” tab.\n\nRichardson and Crawford were both selected in the 2000 Draft and combined to play in more than 2,100 NBA games.\n\nCrawford, a guard who was picked No. 8 in the Draft by the Cleveland Cavaliers and traded to the Chicago Bulls, is tied with Lou Williams as the only players in NBA history to win the Kia Sixth Man of the Year Award in three different seasons. Crawford played for the Bulls, Knicks, Warriors, Atlanta Hawks, Portland Trail Blazers, LA Clippers, Minnesota Timberwolves, Phoenix Suns and Nets in his 20-year career.\n\nAt 39, and in his final regular season game with Phoenix, Crawford dropped 51 points in a loss to the Dallas Mavericks. That performance made him the oldest NBA player to score 50+ points in a game, as well as the first player to score that many points off the bench in a single NBA game."
