        "text": "Jamal Crawford is a former professional basketball player known for his exceptional skills and longevity in the NBA. He earned a reputation as one of the league's premier ball handlers and scorers throughout his career, playing for multiple teams. Now, he's a Husband, Father, AAU Coach, Community Leader, and forever a hooper at heart. When the Crawford's were building their indoor home basketball court getting a Dr. Dish machine was a no brainer!\n\nJamal and JJ Crawford\n\nJamal's son JJ Crawford is a top ranked player in the class of 2029. He is quickly growing into his role as a shooting guard. Check out some highlights from his 7th grade season in the video below!\n\nJJ is certainly taking after his Dad with his love for the game. The Seattle Rotary are gearing up for another season in hopes of winning another championship on the Made Hoops circuit. Check out some of the similarities between JJ and Jamal's game in the video below!\n\ncrawford Court\n\nAfter JJ's initial experience training with Dr. Dish at a friend's house, it became a non-negotiable decision for the Crawfords to include a shooting machine when building their custom home court. They ultimately chose Dr. Dish because of the sleek design and advanced technology features over other shooting machines.\n\nNow, Jamal, JJ and the whole family can get reps up whenever they want all while building their own custom drills, and saving individual stats to their profiles with the Dr. Dish Player App."
