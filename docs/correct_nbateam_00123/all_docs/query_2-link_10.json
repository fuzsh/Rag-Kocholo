        "text": "Jamal Crawford is one of the greatest scorers ever along with some amazing handles to go with his scoring touch. So when someone like him has an opinion on a rookie like Lonzo Ball it’s definitely worth listening to what he has to say. “Star. Absolutely a star. I love watching him play. He plays the right way. He doesn’t play for stats. He’ll give the ball up early when he could easily hold it to get an assist. He’s making the right play if it was a hockey assist he’d get 20 a game cause he’s always passing up early. He seems like a great teammate. If you look at all his interviews…he’s always well spoken he’s always about the team. I wouldn’t (change his shot). He’s done it his whole life. Even if he struggled, I’m sure he’s struggled, but when he makes 10 in a row you won’t change it then so I’d just keep it consistent.”\n\nFrom the 2012-13 season through the 2016-17 campaign, Jamal Crawford was a member of the Los Angeles Clippers. During that span, the Clippers made the playoffs each seasons, but never reached the Western Conference Finals. Crawford sat down with Marcus Thompson of The Athletic to explain why the Warriors broke through and the Clippers did not. “The Warriors weren’t only the best team, but they were the best team (emphasizing their cohesiveness and chemistry),” Crawford told Thompson. “They never splintered. They stayed together. They handled the moment. You gotta have that. When adversity hits, it doesn’t build character, it reveals it. We didn’t handle it well. And then, at the wrong time, we had injuries. So some of it was self-inflicted, some of it was bad luck. In that five years I was there, we won the third or fourth most games. We were right there in a lot of different ways, and in some ways we weren’t.”\n\n“Sometimes I practice them, but there’s an art to it, too. I’ve been doing it since I was younger,” Crawford said. “It’s weird because when I first came into the NBA, some people close to me were like, ‘Don’t shoot that shot, it will mess up your percentage.’ But I think if you look at it like that, it’s selfish. Sure, you can be worried about your own percentage but if that shot goes in, it’s a boost for your team and your crowd. I’ve seen that shot change the momentum of games.”\n\n“I embrace the challenge,” Griffin told The Vertical. “With Chris gone, it changed our dynamic. For me, of course, I can look at it: I have the responsibility on my shoulder – all season. I have to do it. When Chris sat out, I was able to show it. I want to prove that I can sustain that style of play. Chris was one person, but we also lost J.J. [Redick], who I knew going into the free-agency process wouldn’t be back, Jamal [Crawford], who I thought we’d keep this summer but we had to move him around. So part of our core guys separated and that affected us. It changed the philosophy and we had to be accepting of the challenge.”\n\nTwo decades later the 6’5″ Crawford still doesn’t play like anybody else, nor does anyone really play like him. He skips as much as runs, his dribble nearing chest height, where coaches teach you not to keep it. When he crosses over, he does so precipitously and with devastating speed. From afar he appears to be all limbs upon which a giant round head bobs, as if the character from those life is good T-shirts came to life. “Damn, you got a lot of juice left in those legs!” Dirk Nowitzki told him last season, and it’s true. He remains in demand. When Crawford became a free agent last summer, the Warriors recruited him. LeBron called: Come to Cleveland. Instead Crawford signed for two years and $8.9 million with Minnesota, a promising team that nonetheless hasn’t made the playoffs since 2004 and whose coach, Tom Thibodeau, is known to be something of a stickler for defense (something that Crawford, it’s fair to say, is not). The match didn’t seem to make a lot of sense.\n\nStoryline: Jamal Crawford Retirement?"
