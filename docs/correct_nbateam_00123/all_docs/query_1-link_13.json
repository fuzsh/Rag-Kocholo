        "text": "Jamal Crawford had a good run in the 20 seasons he played in the NBA. But as great as he was on the court, the three-time Sixth Man of the Year has a big problem with how the sport is being covered by the media.\n\nCrawford first entered the NBA as the Cleveland Cavaliers eighth-overall pick in the 2000 Draft and traded right away to the Chicago Bulls for the rights to Chris Mihm. In the 61 games he played for Windy City during his rookie campaign, eight of which he did as a starter, the 6’5″ guard posted 4.6 points, 1.5 rebounds, and 2.3 assists.\n\nAfter spending his first four seasons as a Bull, Crawford was traded to the New York Knicks. From there, he would showcase his worth as a reserve by posting great numbers of 17.6 points, 2.9 rebounds, 4.4 assists, and 1.1 steals per game during the five seasons he played in the Big Apple as a reserve.\n\nEven though he would bounce around the league until the end of his career, Crawford won the Sixth Man of the Year award in three instances. Once with the Atlanta Hawks during the 2009-10 season, and twice with the Los Angeles Clippers in 2014 and 2016. He would retire four years later during the 2019-20 campaign after playing just a single game for the Brooklyn Nets.\n\nFormer NBA Star Jamal Crawford Drops Brutally Honest Take on His Problem With Media\n\nAround a month ago, Crawford guested on The Draymond Green Show and talked about several topics, such as facing off against Golden State Warriors star Stephen Curry and the potential of San Antonio Spurs rookie Victor Wembanyama. He also talked about his problem about basketball media, as seen in a tweet shared by NBACentral:\n\nJamal Crawford has an issue with basketball media\n\n“My problem is basketball is one of the only sports, or only things, where you don’t have to be a professional to judge professionals and get people looking at it like you’re the gospel, and it’s crazy to me,” NBACentral tweeted.\n\nAt this point in time, there are several personalities putting their thoughts about the game as part of the media, such as Shannon Sharpe. However, there are former NBA stars who have transitioned to covering the league as part of the media, such as Shaquille O’Neal, Charles Barkley, and JJ Redick, among others.\n\nAlthough Crawford has a point about his problem with how the media covers basketball, it should be remembered that he has been covering the league since 2021 for NBA League Pass. Hopefully, his concern can be addressed and made even better in the years to come.\n\nFor More Great Basketball Content"
