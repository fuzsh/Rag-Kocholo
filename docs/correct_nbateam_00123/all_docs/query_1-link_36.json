        "text": "The NBA honored Los Angeles Clippers' Jamal Crawford with the 2015-16 Kia NBA Sixth Man Award for his impressive contribution to his team as a reserve. With the latest accolade bestowed on him, the 36-year-old Crawford now holds the record as the only player who has received the award thrice already.\n\nApart from being the only NBA player to set a record of receiving NBA Sixth Man Award three times, the latest vote on Crawford also resulted in him breaking his own record that he set two years ago. At 34 back then, Crawford made history as the oldest recipient of the award. With him getting named as the NBA Sixth Man Award again this year, the record he set earlier has been broken by nobody else but him.\n\nCrawford emerged as the winner after majority of the panel of 130 sportswriters and broadcasters from USA and Canada placed their bets on him, with 51 of the 130 ranking him first. Overall Crawford garnered a total of 341 votes.\n\nGet Our Latest News for FREE\n\nSubscribe to get daily/weekly email with the top stories (plus special offers!) from The Christian Post. Be the first to know.\n\nFollowing Crawford in the ranking was Golden State Warriors' Andre Iguodala who obtained 33 first-place votes and a total of 288 points. On the other hand, Oklahoma City Thunder's Enes Kanter got 19-first place votes and a total of 182 points, leaving him at the third place overall.\n\nEach player was given five points for every first-place vote, three for second, and one for third.\n\nAt 36 years old, Crawford is now an NBA veteran. He first won the Kia NBA Sixth Man Award back for the 2009-2010 edition of the award when he was still a part of the Atlanta Hawks. During the award's 2013-2014 edition, he was once again bestowed with the honor. That time, he was already with his current team, Clippers.\n\nApart from being the only player to have won the award for three times and setting the record of being the oldest recipient of the award, Crawford's latest victory in the Kia NBA Sixth Man Award also makes him set another first as he is the only player to have received the award for his stint with different teams."
