The 23-year-old, now wearing No. 33, is a backup point guard to John Wall in Washington, D.C., and is hoping some newfound maturity will help solidify his status in the league. As of now, entering a contract year, he has to prove he's not a bust.\n\nFormer Wolverine and current Los Angeles Clippers shooting guard Jamal Crawford was the No. 8 overall pick in the 2000 NBA draft after spending one year at U-M.\n\nBen Margot | AP Photo\n\nJamal Crawford\n\nStill one of the finest bench players in the league, Crawford is entering his 17th NBA season overall and fifth with the Clippers.

Once he returned to the roster, though, Hardaway played well and appeared in the team's final 47 regular-season games and nine of 10 postseason contests. Now, coming off a \"magnificent\" summer, this season will be crucial for the 24-year-old's future as he looks for his next contract.\n\nSince leaving Michigan in 2010, Manny Harris has played parts of four seasons in the NBA Development League.\n\nJoel Bissell | MLive.com\n\nManny Harris\n\nHarris played in the NBA Development League, Turkey and China last season, most recently winning All-Chinese NBL Player-of-the-Year honors after averaging 35.9 ppg, 9.6 rpg and 3.8 apg for Anhui Wenyi.

Still recovering from surgery last March, the 22-year-old is reportedly progressing, but still limited to strengthening work. The Nets are likely to move slowly with LeVert through his rookie season, allowing him to strengthen his foot and play healthy.\n\nOklahoma City Thunder forward Mitch McGary was the No. 21 overall pick of the 2014 NBA draft after leaving Michigan following his sophomore year.\n\nSue Ogrocki | AP Photo\n\nMitch McGary\n\nWith his NBA career on the brink of oblivion, McGary will miss the first 15 games of the season due to two suspensions, one being for a failed drug test.
