The Golden State Warriors are 10th in the Western Conference. They are 18-18 at home and have lost four of their five overtime games. Simply put, Steve Kerr‘s team has struggled for consistency this season and, at times, has looked like it is still searching for an identity.

Nevertheless, Golden State still has a chance to make the postseason. They will, however, likely need to navigate the play-in tournament to get there. Still, former NBA guard Jamal Crawford believes you can’t count the Warriors out as long as Steph Curry is on the roster.

“As long as you have Curry, you always have a shot. (No pun intended.) They can be dangerous with the right matchup and the right magic,” Crawford wrote in a mailbag article for NBA.com. “What I mean by magic is I’m not sure anybody had them winning their last championship before the playoffs started. So they’ve shown they can go on those magical runs when it matters most.”

If the Warriors can remain healthy and find an identity on the defensive end, they can still be a force in the playoffs, assuming they can navigate a potential two-game play-in tournament to get there.

With fresh young talent in the rotation and an elite veteran core, Kerr’s team can make some noise in the coming weeks. After all, not many teams have the championship experience available within the Warriors locker room, and fans will continue to be hopeful of a strong finish to the season.
