A reunion between the Golden State Warriors and Jamal Crawford might be on the way, but some money issues seem to be hampering the deal.

This month, Crawford declined his $4.5M player option for 2018-19 season with the Minnesota Timberwolves. The 38-year-old, who hasn't won a ring, might enter a deal with the defending champions. But per ESPN's Zach Lowe, the Warriors and Crawford might not be exactly heading towards the same direction:

There is some mutual interest between the Warriors and Jamal Crawford in a potential minimum deal, sources say. He might want more than the minimum. It's unclear if the Warriors will use their mini-midlevel exception, but if they do, it likely will not be on Crawford.

After deciding to opt out and enter the free agency market, Crawford shared that he's looking for a team that he can fit in easily:

“My No. 1 priority is fit,” Crawford told Jon Krawczynski of The Athletic in a phone conversation. “I think that’s very, very important. I’ve seen so many different situations in the NBA and fit is so important.”

“The way I look at everything is my career is a book and this was the chapter of the book,” Crawford said. “I have no regrets about it. I’m glad I was able to experience what I was able to experience. Now it’s time to move forward.”

“For me, it’s just fit. I don’t think anything’s wrong (in Minnesota),” Crawford said when asked what prompted him to opt out. “There’s nothing wrong that’s not wrong anywhere else. It’s the NBA. Everybody’s not going to get along every second. That’s not realistic.
