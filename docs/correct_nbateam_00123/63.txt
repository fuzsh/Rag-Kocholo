As a respected bucket-getter, Jamal Crawford has helped defined what it means to provide a scoring punch, whether as a reserve or a starter.

That ability to quickly and consistently score has been the hallmark of Crawford’s career. When the 2000s were coming to a close, Crawford was starting his prime and his performances were filled with buckets.

Flash back to the 2008-09 season, where he began the campaign on the New York Knicks. During November 2008, Crawford was traded to the Golden State Warriors. He didn’t stay with Golden State past that season, as he was traded to the Atlanta Hawks in the summer of 2009.

Despite his short time with the Warriors, Crawford’s 54 games in the Bay is one of the best stretches of his career.

Crawford was second on the Warriors in scoring that season, right behind Stephen Jackson. Crawford averaged 19.7 points per game on 40.6% shooting, and he was also second in assists, averaging 4.4 per game.

The 2008-09 season was one of Crawford’s best. According to Basketball Reference, his 19.7 points per game is the second-highest average of his career. He scored a career-high 20.6 points a game with the Knicks during the 2007-08 campaign.

While playing with the Warriors, Crawford had one of the best performances of his career.

Golden State was playing the Charlotte Bobcats in December 2008. Both teams were under .500, and Crawford scored a game-high 50 points to lead the Warriors to a 110-103 win. He made a career-high 17 free throws, only missing one of his 18 attempts.

A three-time Sixth Man of the Year, Crawford is a free agent. Though he’s near the end of his career, he showed he can still produce last season.

He scored a game-high 51 points off the bench with the Phoenix Suns in their 120-109 loss to the Dallas Mavericks. Crawford has scored 50-plus points four times in his career.

One of the most prestigious milestones a player can reach is scoring 20,000 career points.

Not only does it show their scoring prowess, but also their longevity. With 19,414 points, Crawford is 586 points from earning that accomplishment. If he achieves the milestone, he will be one of 47 players in league history to score at least 20,000 points.
