The Bahmani Sultanate, founded by Hasan Gangu Bahmani, marked the dawn of an independent Muslim realm in the Deccan region of southern India. Its inception stemmed from the successful uprising against Muhammad Bin Tughlaq in 1327 A.D.

The territories of Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka, and Maharashtra were integrated into the burgeoning Bahmani Sultanate. Initially established in Gulbarga, the capital was later relocated to Bidar.

Administratively, the governance model mirrored a Feudal Government structure. Provinces or states within the Sultanate were referred to as Tarafs. The official language of the Sultanate was Persian, though local languages like Urdu, Deccani, Marathi, Telugu, and Kannada were commonly used.
