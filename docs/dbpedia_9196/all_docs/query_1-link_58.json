        "text": "Bahmani Kingdom\n\nAlauddin Hasan Bahman Shah (Hasan Gangu) founded the Bahmani Kingdom in 1347 and it lasted till 1526 AD. It is also acknowledged that the Bahmani Kingdom was the first Muslim kingdom in the Decca region. With its ascent to prominence in the South, the Bahmani empire presented the mighty Vijayanagara empire with a daunting challenge. In the later period, the Bahmani monarchy was split into five separate kingdoms.\n\nIn-depth discussions of the Bahmani Kingdom’s major features, including its notable kings, governing structures, works of art and architecture, literature, and other significant information, will be provided in this page. The Bahmani kingdom reached its zenith under Prime Minister Mahmmad Gawan’s leadership. He was a Persian tradesman. The Bahmani kingdom’s foundations were demolished after the sultanate’s defeat by King Krishnadevaraya of Vijayanagara in a battle.\n\nBahmani Kingdom History\n\nUp to 1347, Zafar Khan, also referred to as Hasan Gangu, served as a commander and the governor of the Decca region for Muhammad Bin Tughlaq. A victorious uprising against the Delhi Sultanate was headed by Hasan Gangu. In the Deccan, he founded the autonomous Bahmani Kingdom. The endorsement of powerful Sufi saints of the era validated the Sultan’s political power. As a result of this assistance, the Sultan was able to establish his political power and was given the title of “Alauddin Bahman Shah,” the founder of the Bahmani Kingdom.\n\nBahmani Kingdom Rulers\n\nHasan Gangu Bahmani\n\nHe founded the Bahmani empire in what is now the Indian Deccan. He served as Muhammad Bin Tughlaq’s Turkish Officer in Devagiri in the past. In the year 1347, he founded the Bahmani kingdom. His dominion covered the entire Deccan region up to the Krishna River, stretching from the Arabian Sea in the west to the Bay of Bengal in the east. It had Devagiri as its capital.\n\nMuhammad Shah I (1358-1377 A.D.)\n\nHe took over from his father to lead the Bahmani Kingdom as its second king. He was an excellent general and administrator. Bukka-I of Vijayanagar and the Kapila Nayaks of Warangal were vanquished by him.\n\nMuhammad Shah II (1378-1397 A.D.)\n\nIn 1378, he ascended to the throne. He significantly influenced the dynasty’s architecture. He had a calm demeanour and built cordial diplomatic relationships with his neighbours. He constructed medical facilities for his state’s citizens. Numerous mosques, madrasas, and other religious institutions were constructed by him.\n\nFeroz Shah Bahmani (1397-1422 A.D.)\n\nMost people agree that Taj ud-Din Feroz Shah was the best sultan of the Bahmani Kingdom. He married the daughter of Vijayanagara Empire Emperor Deva Raya I after defeating him. On the banks of the Bhima River, he founded the city of Firozabad. He supported literature, the arts, and culture.\n\nAhmad Shah (1422-1435 A.D.)\n\nAfter Feroz Shah Bahmani, Ahmad Shah assumed the role of ruler in 1422. He was a cruel and violent monarch who lacked compassion. He was successful in subduing the Warangal kingdom. He made Bidar his capital instead of Gulbarga. He passed away in the year 1435 AD, as was his fate.\n\nMuhammad Shah III (1463-1482 A.D)\n\nMuhammad Shah ll, being just nine years old, ascended to the position of Sultan of the Bahmani Kingdom in 1463 A.D. Sultan was too young, therefore Muhammad Gawan took over as regent. Because of the skillful leadership of Muhammad Gawan, the Bahmani kingdom rose to great strength. Sangameshwar, Vijayanagar, Orissa, Konkan, and their respective kings were all vanquished by Muhammad Gawan.\n\nMuhammad Gawan\n\nHe was a sage academic and a superb administrator. His efforts to organise the finances, promote public education, modify the tax code, and discipline the troops allowed him to enhance the administration. To a significant extent, he was effective in eliminating corruption. Muhammad Shah III executed Muhammad Gawan in 1481 as a result of Deccan Muslims’ persecution of him.\n\nBahmani Kingdom & Life under It\n\nBeing a Muslim state that split off from the Delhi Sultanate in 1347, the Bahmani state was greatly affected by the Delhi Sultanate’s art, culture, and other facets of daily life.\n\nGeneral Administration\n\nThe Bahmani Sultans followed the Delhi Sultanate’s administrative system with little to no change. Small kingdom areas were controlled by provincial governors under a feudal system of government. Sultan served as the nation’s ruler. Sultan possessed total authority over all facets of the government. Sultan had limitless authority in every area since he was seen as the God’s representative on earth.\n\nFour provinces, known as Tarafs, with the capitals in Daulatabad, Gulbarga, Bidar, and Berar comprised Muhammad Shah I’s domains. Every Taraf had a governor, known as a Taradfdar, who was in control of the military and administration but still reporting to the Sultan as a whole. In the Sultan’s Central Administration, ministerial positions were occasionally also given to Tarafdars.\n\nUnder Mahmud Gawan, the empire grew, and the Taraf population reached eight. Mahmud Gawan allocated a portion of each Taraf as the Sultan’s domain in order to contain the Tarafdars’ authority. The Tarafs were separated into Sarkars and Sarkars were further divided into Parganas for administrative convenience. At the Pargana level, the administrators were Kotwal, Deshmukh, or Desais. A Patel or Kulkarni-led administration’s fundamental unit was the village.\n\nThe administrative officers of the Bahmani Kingdom were as under:\n\nOfficer Role Vakil-us-Sultana Was equivalent to Naib Sultan of Delhi Sultanate. Peshwa Attached to the Vakil. Wazir-i-Kul Prime Minister; Supervised all other ministries. Amir-i-Jumla Head of the Finance Department Wazir Deputy Chief of the Finance Department. Wazir Ashraf Head of the Foreign affairs and Royal Court. Sadr-i-Jahan Head of the Judicial and Charities department. Kotwal Head of the Police Department. Tarafdar Provincial Governor.\n\nBahmani Kingdom Military Administration\n\nThe Bahmani Kingdom possessed a sizable standing army, which was essential given the country was frequently at war with other nations.\n\nSultan served as the army’s supreme commander.\n\nThe general in charge of the army was Amir-ul-Umra.\n\nThe Sultan’s personal bodyguards were known as Khas-i-Khel.\n\nInfantry (foot soldiers), Cavalry (horsemen), War elephants, and Artillery weapons were some of the army’s resources.\n\nThe Mansabdari system, in which commanders were given jagirs depending on rank, was widely used in the military.\n\nKiledars, who were directly answerable to the Central Authority, were the officers in control of the forts.\n\nBahmani Kingdom Revenue Administration\n\nThe main source of income was land revenue. The in charge of revenue administration was Amir-e-Jumla. A third of the agricultural products were subject to tax. Other common taxes included those on houses, mining, tobacco, grasslands, trade, and employment. Tax revenue was used to support the army, royal court, and palaces as well as for public benefit projects.\n\nBahmani Kingdom Architecture\n\nPersian architecture had a significant impact on architecture and was a fusion of Indo-Islamic design. The two capital cities of Bidar and Gulbarga served as the main hubs of Bahmani Kingdom architecture. Persia and the surrounding areas invited architects to design stunning buildings. Important structures are:\n\nAt Gulbarga\n\nGulbarga Fort\n\nJama Masjid\n\nHaft Gumbaz\n\nAt Bidar\n\nMadrasa Mahmud Gawan\n\nBidar Fort\n\nBahmani Tombs\n\nAdditionally, Hasan Gangu built the Chand Minar in Daulatabad.\n\nBahmani Kingdom Culture\n\nThe first sovereign Muslim monarchy in South India was the Bahmani monarchy. It contributed to the growth of Islam and Indo-Islamic customs in Deccan. The Bahmani Sultans supported numerous Sufi saints, such as Banda Nawaz and Gesu Daraz, which led to the development of Sufism in the South. The Bahmani Kingdom is also credited for fostering the spread of Persian and Dakkhani Urdu.\n\nBahmani Kingdom Decline\n\nThe kings of Bahmani and Vijayanagar were constantly at war. Muhammad Shah III’s successors were too feeble and ineffective to maintain the empire. They fought with foreign empires, which contributed to their continued decline.\n\nOther Important Article for UPSC Brahmo samaj Rajputs kingdom Arya samaj Travancore kingdom Awadh kingdom Vijayanagara Empire\n\nSharing is caring!"
