        "text": "Table of Contents\n\nIntroduction: Bahmani Kingdom\n\nThe Bahmani Kingdom was a significant medieval Indian state that emerged in the Deccan Plateau region in the mid-14th century. Founded by Ala-ud-din Bahman Shah, the Bahmani Sultanate was a formidable power in South India.\n\nStretching across present-day Karnataka, Maharashtra, Telangana, and Andhra Pradesh, the Bahmani Sultanate played a crucial role in the political landscape of the Deccan. The kingdom’s capital shifted several times between Gulbarga, Bidar, and Bijapur as different rulers came to power.\n\nThe Bahmani Sultanate was known for its rich cultural heritage, with a blend of Persian, Turkish, and indigenous Indian influences evident in its art, architecture, and language. It fostered a cosmopolitan society, attracting scholars, poets, and artisans from various parts of the Islamic world.\n\nDespite internal conflicts and external pressures from neighboring kingdoms and later the Vijayanagara Empire, the Bahmani Sultanate persisted for over two centuries before eventually fragmenting into five smaller successor states known as the Deccan Sultanates in the early 16th century.\n\nRebellion of Ismail Mukh\n\nThe rebellion of Ismail Mukh is a significant event in the early history of the Bahmani Sultanate. It played a crucial role in the foundation of the Sultanate under Ala-ud-din Bahman Shah.\n\nIsmail Mukh was a nobleman and a powerful governor in the Delhi Sultanate, holding significant influence in the Deccan region. However, he rebelled against the Delhi Sultanate’s authority in between 1346 and 1347 and declared independence.\n\nIsmail Mukh’s rebellion marked the beginning of the Bahmani Sultanate’s emergence as a distinct political entity in the Deccan.\n\nAla-ud-din Bahman Shah, one of Ismail Mukh’s generals, joined the rebellion and played a key role in its success. After defeating the forces of the Delhi Sultanate, Ala-ud-din proclaimed himself the Sultan of the newly founded Bahmani Sultanate in 1347, with its capital initially established at Gulbarga.\n\nNotable Rulers\n\nAla-ud-Din Bahman Shah\n\nThe sultanate was founded in 1347 by Ala-ud-Din Bahman Shah, whose original name was Hasan Gangu.\n\nHe established his capital at Gulbarga. Gulbarga was the capital of the Bahmani kingdom until about 1422 AD.\n\nHe was a noble in the court of Muhammad bin Tughluq.\n\nFirishta mentioned that he called himself Hasan Gangu as he was a servant of a Brahmin astrologer named Gangu.\n\nMahmud Shah I (1358-75)\n\nHis reign was remembered for battles between Bahmanis and Vijayanagara and the Warangal under Kapaya Nayaka.\n\nThe Takht-e-firoza (a jewel-studded royal throne) was gifted to him by Musunuri Nayaka (king of Warangal).\n\nLater Sultans\n\nTaj ud-Din Firuz Shah was a poet and wrote under the name of Firozi.\n\nAhmad Shah Wali (1422-35) transferred the capital from Gulbarga to Bidar.\n\nHumayun Shah Zalim (1458-1461) is described as a cruel ruler for executing people barbarically.\n\nMahmud Gawan\n\nDuring the time of Mujahid Shah (1355-1356), the recruitment of foreign troops began on a large scale. They were known as ‘newcomers‘.\n\nDuring the reign of Alauddin Ahmad Shah (1436-58) a Persian “newcomer” named Mahmud Gawan rose to prominence.\n\nHe was appointed Prime Minister under Humayun Shah (1458-1461).\n\nAccording to a contemporary history book “Burhan-e-Masir,” Gawan was able to capture many forts and cities of the Konkan region.\n\nIn the fifteenth century, the Bahmani court became a hotbed of conspiracy. The royal court was divided into two factions of nobles – The Deccanis (of local origin) and Afaqis (of Foreign origin). Mahmud Gawan was an Afaqi. Muhammad III executed Mahmud Gawan (1481) for the conspiracy of the Deccanis.\n\nThe Bahmani kingdom was divided into five independent sultanate –\n\nBarid Shahi at Bidar,\n\nAdil Shahi at Bijapur,\n\nImad Shahi at Berar,\n\nQutub Shahi at Golconda and\n\nNizam Shahi at Ahmadnagar.\n\nAdministration\n\nArchitecture: Bahmani Kingdom\n\nIn 1470, the Russian merchant Athanasius Nikitin visited Bidar, the capital of the Bahmani kingdom."
