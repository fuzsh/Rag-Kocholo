        "text": "Kalaburagi is a city in the Indian state of Karnataka. It was formerly known as Gulbarga. It is the administrative centre of the Kalaburagi district and the largest city in North Karnataka (Kalyana-Karnataka). Kalaburagi is located 623 kilometres north of Bangalore, the state capital. Through the States Reorganisation Act of 1956, it was incorporated into the newly formed Mysore State (now known as Karnataka). So here are some places to explore when in Gulbarga.\n\n1. Khwaja Bande Nawaz Dargah\n\nVisit the Khwaja Bande Nawaz Dargah to see a rare convergence of religious diversity. This is the tomb of the famous Sufi mystic Khwaja Bande Nawaz. This mausoleum, which houses a large library with over ten thousand books in Urdu, Arabic, and Persian, is one of the most visited sites in Gulbarga.\n\nThe dome and towers that surround the tomb demonstrate Persian, Indo-Saracenic, and Arabic influences. Even today, the Darga stands as a testament to the region's religious unity. People believe that all wishes granted to sincere devotees who enter the mausoleum, regardless of religion, come true. The neem tree planted on the saint's daughter's grave is also said to have healing properties.\n\nThe Dargah is built in the Indo-Saracenic architectural style. It is made up of walls and pillars that appear to be white in colour. The domes, arches, and walls are inspired by Bahamian, Turkish, and Iranian architecture. The Dargah was built in the 14th century and contains manuscripts and written materials from the time.\n\nThe Dargah's history can be traced back to the 14th century when it was built as a medium to provide spiritual training to the people of Gulbarga. The Dargah was a religious centre where people could learn and practise Islamic values. It was a significant step toward establishing the religion's spiritual values in Southern India. When Khwaja Syed Mohammad Gesu Daraz arrived in Gulbarga, he was 76 years old and engaged in religious discourses, sermons, and spiritual training. He spent his final days in Gulbarga, after which his tomb was built in the Dargah.\n\nGulbarga is subjected to harsh climatic conditions. Summer temperatures range from 25 to 35 degrees Celsius, while winter temperatures range from 20 to 25 degrees Celsius. As a result, the best time to visit the Dargah is from October to February.\n\n2. The Buddha Vihar\n\nIf you enjoy peace, Buddha Vihar is the place to be. It is nestled among arrant tranquillity and serenity. The monument, which is located within Gulbarga University, is a significant Buddhist pilgrimage centre built in traditional Indian Buddhist styles. The Vihar is located in Gulbarga, which is also known as Kalaburagi Buddha Vihar; formally inaugurated by Tibet's spiritual leader, the Dalai Lama, and stands as a shrine to nonviolence and world peace. Remember that the site is closed every day between 12 p.m. and 4:00 p.m.\n\nBuddha Vihar is filled with delightful artistic designs and an impeccable blend of architectural elements. The construction started in 2002 and was initially thought to be much smaller. The Trust, on the other hand, changed the blueprint to make it into a massive complex, one of the best in South India.\n\nThere is a meditation centre in the basement, and four Ashoka pillars, each 48 feet tall, stand in the corners of the main building. These pillars represent the four noble truths: the truth of suffering, the truth of suffering's cause, the truth of suffering's cessation, and the truth of the path that leads to the end of suffering.\n\nThe fort is only two kilometres away from the Kalaburagi Railway Station. The nearest airport is in Hyderabad, which is about 235 kilometres away from the Kalaburagi district. Visitors arriving by plane would have to take a bus or rent a car. The shrine is easily accessible from all major national and state highways. Once in Gulbarga, one can take a cab or a bus to Buddha Vihar.\n\nBuddha Vihara is somewhat removed from the maddening crowd and provides a peaceful and solitary environment in which to meditate and compose your thoughts. The meditation hall lives up to its reputation and is the place to be if you want to relax your body and mind.\n\n3. Gulbarga Fort\n\nThis fort, arguably Gulbarga's most popular tourist attraction, was built in the twelfth century by Kakatiya king Raja Gulchand. This granite monument has a stunning façade with a lovely blend of Persian and Indian architecture. The Fort was expanded by the Bahmani rulers two hundred years later to form a formidable barrier to invaders. The structure, which has 15 towers, is sure to make you marvel at the glory of the rulers of old. With its spires and columns, the Jama Masjid located inside warms the soul. You can also picnic with your loved ones inside the fort's ruins!\n\nThe architecture of Gulbarga Fort is inspired by Iranian Persian architecture. The fort's design was inspired by Spain's Great Mosque of Cordoba, and it features typical arched doorways and Moorish architectural beauty. The structure is quite impressive and leaves a lasting impression on visitors. The gardens, mosques, arches, and palaces within the fort, as well as throughout the town of Gulbarga, speak to the Indo-Persian architectural wonders that evolved in the Deccan. This occurred primarily after the formation of the Bahamani dynasty in 1347.\n\nThe fort encompasses some ancient mosques, buildings, stables and temples. There are structures like towers and ammunition dumps within the fort as well. Jama Masjid and the tomb of Khawa Bande Nawaz are situated within the premises of the fort, and many people from around the country visit them to seek blessings. Adding to its charm, the fort has a tranquil lake situated beside it which forms an excellent backdrop. Sit back on the banks of the lake and relax with a breath-taking view of the surroundings in front of your eyes. There's a treasure trove within the fort which comprises some vintage object d'arts! The tourists often visit Bhima and Krishna, the two rivers that flow close to the Gulbarga Fort and. The fort is a huge one and covers an area of around 38000 sq. Feet.\n\nThe nearest airport to Gulbarga is in Sholapur. It is located 81 kilometres away from the city. In addition, major cities such as Hyderabad, Bangalore, and Chennai are well-connected to Gulbarga via trains and regular flights. Buses that run regularly from Bangalore and Mysore can also take you to Gulbarga. Gulbarga is about 200 kilometres from Hyderabad.\n\n4. Sharana Basaveshwara Temple\n\nSharana Basaveshwara Temple, also known as Sabhamandapa, is located in Gulbarga. It is a sacred site dedicated to Saint Basaveshwara, who is known as a teacher, philosopher, and enlightened being who made numerous significant contributions to society while practising Hinduism. This temple, built in the twelfth century by the Lingayat saint Sharana Basaveshwara, is a work of Hindu stone carving art.\n\nThe site's pillars, walls, and towers are intricately carved with Hindu gods, goddesses, demigods, damsels, animals, and events from local lore. The temple is notable for its distinctively unique construction style, which was uncommon at the time. The Sharana Basaveshwara Temple's Car Festival is a must-see. The deity's silver cover and the temple's sandalwood artefacts are carried out on the procession, providing an exceptional insight into the region's various practises. The temple also provides free meals to all pilgrims, regardless of religion; enjoy the local delicacies while participating in this celebrated tradition!\n\nThe temple can be visited at any time of year. However, the most popular time to visit is on auspicious days such as the annual Jatra and Car festival, which commemorates the death and birth anniversaries of Saint Sharana Basaveshwara. During this time, one may witness special prayers and traditional rituals such as farmers donating a portion of their harvest to the temple for the purpose of preparing refreshments for visitors.\n\nSharana Basaveshwara Temple is located at SB Temple Rd, Raghavendra Colony, Berhampur, Gulbarga, 585102, Karnataka. One can get to the destination by taking a cab or bus, or by hiring a private vehicle from anywhere in the city.\n\n5. Chandrampalli Dam\n\nThe Chandrampalli dam is located in the district of Gulbarga, Karnataka. It is one of the primary dams built on the Bhima River's bed (in 1973). The thick forests of Gotham Gotta surround the dam. On the Dam, there is an island that has drawn many tourists and visitors. The Dam is approximately 28.65 metres tall and 926 metres long. The town's pleasant weather is complemented by the stunning scenery of the two mountains linked by the Dam. The area has become well-known for its trekking and camping opportunities. Because the Chandrampalli dam is earthen, it is made of sand, loam, clay, and other materials.\n\nThe dam has six spillway gates, which are located at the dam's southern end. The dam has a capacity of 496.21 metres of water. It has 34.19 mcm of storage space. It also has a path wide enough to walk or drive across the dam. The dam measures 962 metres in length and 28.65 metres in height. The flow of the river Bhima at the dam increases during the monsoon season and decreases during the summer. Because the area around the dam is not densely populated, tourists can enjoy the natural beauty of the area.\n\nTourists who visit the dam can participate in a variety of activities. The dam is located near dense forest cover. This is the main reason why trekking and camping have become popular activities in the area. This trek takes place near the river's flatter banks as well as the rougher terrain of the forest. The majority of camping takes place on the island near the dam. Aside from that, there are numerous tourist attractions near the dam. The Gulbarga Fort, an old premise with several mosques, buildings, and temples, is one of these tourist destinations. Jevargi, a pilgrimage site, is also a lovely location near the dam. Sannati is a tourist destination in the Chittapur taluka, near the banks of the river Bhima. The dam is very close to these tourist attractions in this area.\n\n6. Jama Masjid\n\nJama Masjid is a 14th-century mosque in Gulbarga, Karnataka. It is part of the Gulbarga Fort complex, which commemorates the establishment of the Bahmani Kingdom in the Deccan. The mosque was one of the first in South India. The Jama Masjid Gulbarga and the Spanish Mosque of Hyderabad (built inside Paigah Palace) are the only two Indian mosques that reflect the essence of Spanish architecture. They both have interiors similar to the Great Cathedral-Mosque of Cordoba, Spain.\n\nThe Jama Masjid is regarded as a Deccan architectural marvel. This holy place is said to have been built by Rafi, a Persian architect from Kazwin. One of its distinguishing features is that it is a rare mosque in India without a courtyard. It also does not have any minarets. Instead, a massive central dome is constructed, along with several smaller domes. The entire structure is roofed, giving it a majestic appearance. Inside and outside the mosque, there is a complex network of archways. Its distinctive exterior is a major draw in South East Asia. The mosque influenced Deccan architecture, and similar elements can be found in historical buildings from the later Deccan period.\n\nBecause of its unique and archaic architecture, the Jama Masjid Gulbarga attracts a large number of tourists from all over the world. The mosque is well-known among devotees, and people visit all year to pray and pay their respects.\n\nThe Jama Masjid Gulbarga is located in the Halbarga area of the Gulbarga Fort, just 2 kilometres from the city centre. The masjid is about 7 minutes away. There are plenty of auto rickshaws available to take you to your destination. Gulbarga is very well connected with roads throughout Karnataka if you are travelling the entire state. Gulbarga can be reached by both private and public buses.\n\nKalaburagi Junction Railway Station, located 4.5 kilometres away, is the nearest railway station. It takes about 15 minutes to walk from there to the mosque. Kempegowda International Airport in Bangalore is the nearest major airport. Gulbarga is well connected to Bangalore by train and highway. It's an 11-hour trip.\n\n7. Haft Gumbaz\n\nThe Haft Gumbaz, also spelled Haft Gumbad, are a collection of Bahmani dynasty tombs in Gulbarga, Karnataka, India. The tombs, which were built in the 14th and 15th centuries, are examples of early Indo-Islamic architecture. There are seven tombs in total, four of which are the tombs of the Bahmani dynasty's rulers. The Archeological Survey of India looks after the tomb complex as a national monument. The tomb complex is part of the \"Monuments and Forts of the Deccan Sultanate,\" an ensemble of various structures that has been added to the UNESCO World Heritage List as a tentative listing.\n\nBetween the 14th and 15th centuries, the tomb complex was constructed. The capital was relocated to Bidar in 1425, and the later Bahmani sultans are buried in Bidar's Bahmani tombs complex. Local businesses and institutions have encroached on the tomb complex. K.M. Mujeebuddin, a social activist, has filed an RTI request regarding the upkeep of the tombs."
