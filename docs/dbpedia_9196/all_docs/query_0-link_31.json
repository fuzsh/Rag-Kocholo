        "text": "The Bahmani Empire was famously known as the Bahmani Sultanate, which was considered the first independent Islamic kingdom in south India during the medieval era. The empire was founded as a result of the revolt against Muhammad Bin Tughlaq by the Turkish Governor Ala-ud-Din Hassan Bahman Shah, during the year 1347. He was also famous by the name Zafar Khan.\n\nThe Bahmani empire was considered a powerful kingdom for around 200 years. Until the battle between Krishnadeva Raya and the last ruler of the Bahmani Kingdom. Later Bahmani Sultanate was divided into 5 distinguished states, which were collectively known as the Deccan Sultanates.\n\nOverview of Bahmani Kingdom\n\nStatus Sultanate Capital\n\nGulbarga (1347-1425)\n\nBidar (1425-1527)\n\nCommon Languages\n\nPersian\n\nMarathi\n\nDeccani Urdu\n\nTelugu\n\nKannada\n\nReligion Sunni Islam\n\nGovernment\n\nSultan\n\n1347-1358\n\n1525-1527\n\nMonarchy\n\nAla-ud- Dan Bahman Shah\n\nKalim Allah Shah\n\nHistorical Era\n\nEstablished\n\nDisestablished\n\nLate Medieval\n\n3 August 1347\n\n1527\n\nCurrency Taka\n\nPreceded By\n\nDelhi Sultanate\n\nMusunuri\n\nNayaks\n\nSuceded By\n\nVijayanagar Empire\n\nDeccan Sultanate\n\nPortuguese India\n\nHistory and Background of Bahmani Kingdom\n\nAccording to some myths, Zafar Khan, the founder of the Bahmani sultanate, was earlier the slave of a Brahmin ruler named Gangu. Because of this, he got the name Hassan Gangu. Before the risen of the empire, he was the governor of Deccan, and also the commander under Sultan Tughlaq. Another myth claims that Hassan was connected with the early Persian King Bahaman Shah. However, there is no evidence for the claims.\n\nLater, in the year 1347, Ala-ud-din Hassan Bahman Shah revolted against the Delhi sultanate. At that time, the sultan of the Delhi Sultanate was Muhammad Bin Tughlaq. In the rebellion, he was helped by Nazir Uddin Ismail Shah, who rebelled against the Delhi Sultanate. In the end, his rebellion succeeded, and he established an independent state on Deccan within the southern provinces of the Delhi sultanate, his capital was settled in Hasanabad (Gulbarga). He crowned himself the ” Sultan Alauddin Bahman Shah”, and became the founder of the Bahmani Dynasty.\n\nBahmani Empire under Sultan Alauddin Bahman Shah\n\nUnder Hasan Shah, the power of the Bahmani empire was at its peak. The Prime Minister and General Mahmud Gawan played an important role in the expansion of the Bahmani Sultanate from Daulatabad (West) to Bhongir in Telangana (East), and from the Warangal River (south) to Krishna (North). During its risen period, the Bahmani empire was constantly involved in battles with the Hindu Empire, named Vijaynagar Empire in the south.\n\nAlauddin Shah, according to Farishta, was a very kind ruler who constantly maintained a policy of generosity. His generosity can be seen as according to Ismail, he was the first Muslim king of India to decree that ‘Jizya’ not be imposed on Hindus. Also, he permitted duty-free importation of all agricultural products into his reign. He ruled for eleven years, from the year 1347 to the year 1358. Considering the administration purposes, the Empire, later on, was divided into five subsidiary powers known as the Deccan sultanates. And he appointed a governor for each region.\n\nDuring the years 1347 to 1425 AD, the Bahmani Empire was constantly engaged in conflicts with the Vijayanagara Empire over the control of Deccan. Gulbarga was the capital of the Bahmani, which was then relocated to the Bidar in the year 1425 AD.\n\nBahmani Kingdom after Sultan Alauddin Hasan\n\nLater on, he was succeeded by his son Mohammed Shah I. Then, Ghiyasuddin inherited his father, Muhammad II, but was blinded and imprisoned by Taghalchin, a Turkish ruler. Shamsuddin, a puppet king under Taghalchin, succeeded him. Firoz and Ahmed, the fourth sultan Daud’s sons, marched to Gulbarga to take vengeance on Ghiyasuddin. Firuz Shah proclaimed himself ruler after defeating Taghalchin’s soldiers. Shamsuddin was blinded and Taghalchin was killed.\n\nIn the year 1397, Taj-ud-Din Firoz Shah has crowned the sultan of the Bahmani Empire. Throughout his rule, he fought many battles against the Vijayanagara Empire. It includes his Victoria in the years 1398 and 1406. But in 1419, he was defeated in the battle against the Vijayanagara Empire. His marriage to Deva Raya’s daughter resulted in one of his victories. Following, Ahmad Shah I Wali, who was his younger brother, succeeded to his throne.\n\nLater, the eldest Son of Humayun Shah, named Nizam-Ud-Din Ahmad III, and Muhammad Shah III Lashkari ascended the throne, as at that time they were not reached the right age, Mahmud Gawan ruled as the regent during that period. Mahmud Gawan was considered a great statesman and also a reputed poet. But later he was executed by Muhammad Shah III.\n\nLater his throne was succeeded by his Son Muhammad Shah Bahmani II, who was nothing more than a puppet under the hands of their Barid Shahi Prime Ministers, later, in the year 1518, as expected, the sultanate was divided into five different states:\n\nAhmednagar’s Nizam Shahi,\n\nGolconda’s Qutb Shahi,\n\nBidar’s Barid Shahi,\n\nBerar’s Imad Shahi,\n\nand Bijapur’s Adil Shahi.\n\nThey are known together as the “Deccan Sultanates.”\n\nThe Bahmani Sultans were supporters of the Persian language, culture, and literature, and some rulers of the empire became fluent in it and wrote literature in it. Apart from this, the architectural achievements of the Bahmani Empire were also significant.\n\nPolitical Structure and Administration of Bahmani Kingdom\n\nThe Bahmani Empire had a well-organized political structure and administration to effectively govern its vast territories. At the top was the sultan, who held supreme power and ruled the empire. The administration was centralized, with different departments responsible for various aspects of governance such as finance, justice, military, intelligence, and public works.\n\nThe empire was divided into provinces and districts, each with its own governor and officials who reported directly to the sultan. These officials were responsible for maintaining law and order and overseeing the administration of their respective regions. The empire had a sophisticated revenue system to collect taxes from different sources and a well-developed judicial system with judges known as qazis who applied Islamic law to settle disputes.\n\nThe military played a vital role in the administration, with military commanders appointed to protect the empire’s borders and maintain internal security. The empire had a network of spies and intelligence officers who gathered information, and diplomatic relations were established with neighboring kingdoms and empires.\n\nThe royal court of the sultan served as the center of power and prestige, surrounded by nobles, courtiers, and advisors who assisted in governance. Loyalty and service were rewarded with titles, grants of land, and other privileges. A postal system was established for efficient communication across the empire.\n\nUnderstanding the political structure and administration of the Bahmani Empire helps us comprehend how it governed its territories and maintained control over a diverse population.\n\nArt and Architecture in the Bahmani Kingdom\n\nThe Bahmani kingdom’s sultans built a lot of structures, including mosques, madrasas, and libraries, because they were so drawn to art and architecture. They built\n\nGulbarga Juma Masjid\n\nThe Golconda Fort\n\nThe Golgumbaz at Bijapur\n\nThe Muhammad Gawan Madrasa\n\nRelated Links\n\nImpact of Bahamani Kingdom\n\nImportant questions of Bahamani Kingdom\n\nImportant Questions on the Bahamani Kingdom\n\nImportant Questions on Firoz Shah Tughlaq\n\nImportant Questions on Muhammad Bin Tughlaq\n\nFAQs on Bahmani Kingdom\n\nWho built the Bahmani kingdom?\n\nThe Bahmani Sultanate was founded in 1347 by Ala-ud-Din Bahman Shah.\n\nWhat is the Bahmani kingdom also known as?\n\nThe Bahmani Sultanate, also known as the Bahmani Empire or the Bahmani Kingdom, was also known as Persianate.\n\nWhat is the Bahmani kingdom in history?\n\nThe Bahmani Kingdom was founded in the year 1347 AD by the Turkish governor named Alauddin Bahman Shah.
