        "text": "Bahmani Kingdom and 5 Deccan Sultanates- Complete UPSC Notes\n\nBy\n\nBahmani Kingdom and Deccan Sultanates\n\nAfter the fall of Yadavas and Kakatiyas to the Khaljis and Tughlaqs, several Muslim governorships were established in the region.\n\nMohamed Bin Tughalaq had made an elaborate administrative system for the Deccan region and, in the process, appointed Sada Amir/Amiran-i-sada,e. the chief of hundred villages. They performed both military and revenue functions.\n\nHowever, during the later part of his reign, a series of revolts broke out in the Deccan region, after which he started the policy of their suppression. This lead to an even fierce revolt by the Amirs. This led to the establishment of the Bahmani Kingdom by Ala-ud-Din Bahman Shah (Jafar Khan) in 1347.\n\nBahmani Kingdom (1347-1525 CE)\n\nThe Bahmani Kingdom was spread over modern Karnataka, Maharashtra and Andhra Pradesh, with its capital at Ahsanabad (Gulbarga). They were in a constant tussle with the neighbouring Vijayanagar Empire.\n\nEarly Bahmani Kingdoms:\n\nHasan Gangu/Jafar Khan, the founder of the Sultanate, adopted the title of Abu’l-Muzaffar Ala-ud-din Bahman Shah. His kingdom was divided into four tarafs(provinces)for efficient administration. The four provinces were Gulbarga, Daulatabad, Berar and Bidar.\n\n[Coin minted under Ala-ud-Din Bahman Shah]\n\nMohammed Shah I (1358-1375CE), son of Allaudin Bahaman Shah, succeeded him. Throughout his reign, he was occupied in wars against Warangal and Vijayanagar.\n\nAlauddin Mujahid (1375-78): During his reign, a new factor was introduced in the composition of the nobility, i.e. the Afaqis (foreigners, mainly from Iraq and Iran).\n\nTaj ud-Din Firuz Shah/Firuz Shah Bahamani (1397 – 1422 CE): He expanded Bahmani kingdom and even succeeded in conquering the Raichur Doab from Vijaynagara kingdoms for some time.\n\nHe wanted to make Deccan the cultural capital of India. He was well acquainted with religious texts and natural science like botany, geometry, logic etc.\n\nHe inducted a large number of Hindus into his administration.\n\nIn a peace treaty with the Vijayanagar Kingdom, the daughter of Deva Rai I was married off to him.\n\nMahmud Gawan (1466-1481)\n\nMahmud Gawan (1466-1481) was an Iranian merchant who came to India during the reign of Bahamani sultans. He was introduced to the Sultan and was well received; he was granted the title of Malik-ut-Tujjar.\n\nLater he became the prime minister(Peshwa)during the reign of Muhammad Shah III and dominated the Bahmani kingdom for almost 20 years.\n\nExpansion during Mahmud Gawan:\n\n1. He expanded the Empire to its peak and conquered Kanchi, or Kanjeevaram, deep inside the Vijayanagar Empire. He also captured Goa and Dabhol, the economic centres of the Vijayanagar Empire.\n\n2. He also fought successful wars against Konkan, Sangameshwara, and Orissa rulers.\n\n3. He also performed administrative reforms and divided the territory into eight tarafs under respective tarafdars.\n\n4. He was an eminent patron of art and architecture and built a magnificent Madarasa in Persian style at the capital, Bidar.\n\n5. Russian traveller Nikitin also came during this time. His famous book was The Journey beyond three seas.\n\n6. He was executed in 1482 by the Sultan on account of false allegations made by native Nobels.\n\nThe 5 Deccan Sultanates\n\nSoon after Gawan’s execution in 1482, the Bahmani kingdom weakened and was divided into 5 principalities/5 Deccan Sultanates:\n\n1. Golconda\n\n2. Bijapur\n\n3. Ahmadnagar\n\n4. Berar\n\n5. Bidar\n\nApart from these, a much weaker Khandesh Sultanate too operated independently for some time. It was eventually brought into the Mughal domain by Akbar.\n\n1. Nizamshahis of Ahmadnagar (1490-1633 CE)\n\nFounded by Ahmad Nizam Shah, who was originally a Brahmin.\n\nCapital at Ahmednagar\n\nChand Bibi defended the Bahmani Kingdoms against the attack of the Mughals.\n\nIn 1636, Ahmadnagar was conquered by Aurangzeb, then the Mughal viceroy.\n\n2. Imad Shahis of Berar (1490-1574 CE)\n\nFounded by Fathullah Imad-ul-Mulk\n\nCapital at Daulatabad\n\nAnnexed by Ahmadnagar in 1574.\n\n3. Qutub Shahis of Golconda (1518-1687 CE)\n\nFounded by Muhammad Quli Qutub-ul-Mulk\n\nMuhammad Quli Qutb Shah built Charminar.\n\nConquered by Aurangzeb in 1687.\n\n4. Adilshahis of Bijapur (1490-1686 CE)\n\nFounded by Yusuf Adil Shah.\n\nMuhammad Adil Shah built Gol Gumbaz.\n\nIbrahim Adil Shah II, known as Jagadguru Badshah, wrote the book Kitab-e-Nauras.\n\nAnnexed by Aurangzeb in 1686.\n\n5. Barid Shahis of Bidar (1528-1619 CE)\n\nIt was founded by Ali Barid and was later annexed by Adilshahis of Bijapur in 1619.\n\nIt was the smallest among all 5 Deccani sultanates.\n\nThe decline of the Bahmani Sultanate\n\nThe Bahmani kingdom followed a foreign policy of constant tussling with their neighbours like Vijayanagar and Warangal, significantly weakening the Empire.\n\nThe internal tussle between Afaquis and Deccani nobles led to intrigues within the capital.\n\nThe provincial governors acquired significant power, and with the weakening of the Sultanate, they claimed independence.\n\nThere was no definite law of succession, which led to infighting among several claimants of the throne.\n\nSome of the rulers followed an extremely fanatical religious policy against their Hindu subjects, who formed the majority population of the kingdom.\n\nAdministration of Bahmani Kingdom\n\nThe Bahamanis seem to have adopted the administrative system of the Delhi Sultanate.\n\nBahmani kingdom was divided into Tarafs; initially, there were four tarafs. Each taraf was headed by a tarafdar. During Mahmud Gawan’s reign, as the Empire expanded, the kingdom was divided into eight tarafs.\n\nThe nobility was divided into Afaqis or Pardesis (foreigners) and Deccanis (natives). Both sides were in a constant state of conflict.\n\nThe commander of the army was known as Amir-Ul-Umara. The sultans also had a large number of bodyguards known as khassakhel.\n\nBahamani Society and culture\n\nThe social character was cosmopolitan, and people of various ethnicities, like Hindus, Muslims, Iranians, Abyssinians, lived in the Bahmani kingdoms. Besides, several languages were widely used in the kingdom, such as Dakhani (proto-Urdu), Marathi, Kannada and Telugu.\n\nDakhini was introduced by Ibrahim Adil shah in place of Persian as their\n\nRussian traveller Nikitin has mentioned the two classes; the nobles, who lived a lavish lifestyle and the general population, who were extremely poor.\n\nBahamani ruler greatly venerated Sufis.\n\nThere was a Shia influence in the Bahamani kingdom due to a significant influx of Afaqis (foreign, usually Irani nobles).\n\nFew rulers were intolerant towards Hindu traditions. For example, early Qutub Shahis of Golconda did not allow Hindus to profess their religion and observe festivals publically.\n\nHindu traditions and culture also influenced the Bahmani court. For example, Sultan Feroz’s (1397-1422) marriage with the daughter of Deva Rai II of Vijaynagar strengthened the Hindu-Muslim cultural harmony.\n\nBahmani Kingdom Economy\n\nMahmud Gawan undertook several reforms in land measurement, which led to an increase in the income of the kingdom.\n\nTrade and commerce were flourishing.\n\nNikitin has mentioned trade activities in Bidar. He says the main trade items were horses, cloth, silk, and pepper. He mentioned Dabul as a centre of commercial activity. It provided connectivity with not only Indian but African ports as well.\n\nTrade and commerce were mainly in the hands of Hindu merchants.\n\nBahamani Art and Architecture\n\nIndo-Islamic architecture was prevalent, and the Persian style was a significant influence.\n\nSome of the essential structures of this era are:\n\nThe Madarasa of Mahmud Gawan.\n\nThe Golconda fort.\n\nGol Gumbaz at Bijapur (2nd largest dome in the world).\n\nCharminar at Hyderabad.\n\nGol Gumbaz at Bijapur Source: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gol_Gumbaz\n\nBidri Art\n\nThe famous Bidri Art developed around the 14th century during the Bahmani Sultanates.\n\nBidri is a metal handicraft from the city of Bidar in south India. It uses blackened white brass, inlaid with silver, to produce its characteristic design.\n\nThis technique is influenced by Persian art. It is said to have been brought by Sufi saint Khwaja Moinuddin Hasan Chisti in the form of utensils to India.\n\nThis local art form has earned Geographical Indications Tags recently.\n\nConclusion\n\nBahmani Kingdom UPSC notes emphasize the dynasty’s contribution to Deccan architecture, culture, and the establishment of a distinct Islamic identity in South India, crucial for understanding the region’s historical evolution. The later rulers of the Bahmani Kingdom were too weak to carry out the Empire. Eventually, these were brought under the Mughal empire by Akbar and Aurangzeb. Nevertheless, the impact of Deccan-era Indo-Islamic art and traditions is still prominent in present-day India.\n\nExplore additional significant articles on Medieval Indian History listed in the table below:\n\nThe Tripartite Struggle The Chola Empire The Rajput States Evaluation of Rajput States Regional Powers in South India and Deccan Delhi Sultanate Socio Cultural Impact of the Delhi Sultanate The Vijayanagar Empire The Bhakti Movement Bhakti Movement In North The Advent of the Portuguese The Mughal Empire Economic and Cultural Impact of the Mughal Empire The Decline of the Mughal Empire Maratha Empire Modern India\n\nSimilar Posts\n\nEvaluation of Rajput States- UPSC Notes\n\nBy\n\nEvaluation of Rajput States In the previous page, we discussed the chronology of the Rajput states and the early Muslim invasions.
