It was founded in the year 1347 by the Turkish Governor Ala-ud-Din Hassan Bahman Shah who was also known as Hassan Gangu. He had revolted successfully against the Sultan of Delhi, Muhammad bin Tughlaq.\n\nThe Bahmani Empire was always at war with Vijayanagara Empire for control over Deccan. The capital of Bahmani Empire was Gulbarga from 1347 AD to 1425 AD. It was moved to Bidar in 1425 AD.\n\nBahmani Empire reached its zenith during the time of Mahmud Gawan who was a minister of the Empire. Mahmud Gawan was executed in 1482 AD by Muhammad Shah III which was an outcome of the rivalry between Deccanis and the Afaquis sections. Following his execution the empire started disintegrating. The Empire disintegrated into five small kingdoms namely Adamshahi (of Ahmadnagar), Adilshahi (of Bijapur), Kutubshahi(of Golkonda), Barishahi( Bidar) and Imadshahi kingdom of Berar (This was annexed by Ahmed nagar). Bijapur, Ahmadnagar, Bijapur and Berar declared their indpendence in 1490 AD, Bidar in 1492 AD while Golkonda got itself separated in 1512 AD. Kalimullah was the last king of the Bahmani dynasty.\n\nThe nobles of Bahmani kingdom were categorized in two categories namely Afaquis and Deccanis. Deccanis were nobles of native origin while Afaquis had foreign origin.\n\nFind Information on:\n\nBattle of Talikota (1565 AD)\n\nPost Bahmani Era: Deccan Sultanates\n\nVijayanagar Empire: Aravidu Dynasty\n\nKrishnadeva Raya (1509-1529 AD)\n\nVijayanagar Empire: Tuluva Dynasty\n\nThe Vijayanagar Empire: Saluva Dynasty"
