        "text": "The Bahmani Kingdom was a medieval kingdom in South India that thrived from the 14th to the 16th century. The kingdom was founded by Alauddin Hasan Bahman Shah and was established in 1347. The sultanate was a Persianised Muslim State of the Deccan in the South Indian region. This marked the beginning of a powerful and independent dynasty that aimed to challenge the supremacy of the Delhi Sultanate in the Deccan region. The kingdom with its capital at Gulbarga (present-day Kalaburagi in Karnataka, India), flourished rapidly under the leadership of its ambitious rulers. In this blog, we will learn more about the Bahmani Kingdom and know about its rulers, administration and decline.\n\nHistory of the Bahmani Kingdom\n\nThe Bahmani Kingdom was founded in 1347 by Zafar Khan, who declared independence from the Delhi Sultanate of Muhammad Bin Tughlaq, while he was serving as a commander and the governor of this Deccan Region. Later the Sufi Saints asserted his political dominance in the region and was given the title of Alauddin Bahman Shah.\n\nThe kingdom’s capital was initially located at Gulbarga but later moved to Bidar. Over the years, the Bahmani Kingdom expanded its territory and acted as a cultural bridge between the North and South regions.\n\nAlso Read – Tughlaq Dynasty: Rulers of Delhi Sultanate\n\nList of Rulers of the Bahmani Kingdom\n\nThere were in total 14 Bahman Sutans. The kingdom saw the reign of several powerful and influential kings throughout its existence.

It had a diverse population, with people from different backgrounds coexisting harmoniously. The kingdom was a centre of art, architecture, and literature, attracting scholars, poets, and artists from far and wide. Some key aspects of Bahmani society and culture include:\n\nPersian Influence: Urdu and Persian were the dominant languages in the Bahmani Kingdom. The kingdom witnessed a flourishing of literature, with renowned poets and scholars like Abdul-Qadir Bada’uni and Muhammad Quli Qutb Shah leaving behind a rich literary legacy.\n\nReligious Toleration: The Bahmanids were known for their policy of religious tolerance, providing patronage to Hindu scholars, poets, and artists, along with the traditional patrons of Islamic art and literature.\n\nArchitectural Marvels: The Bahmani Kingdom witnessed a flourishing of architectural brilliance. Its art and architecture comprised –\n\nAt Gulbarga – Gulbarga Fort, Haft Gumbaz and Jama Masjid in Gulbarga\n\n2. Haft Gumbaz\n\nAt Bidar – Bidar Fort, Bahmani Tombs, etc\n\nGol Gumbaz at Bijapur\n\nThe Decline of the Bahmani Dynasty\n\nInternal conflicts, rivalries among the nobles, and external invasions eventually led to the decline of the Bahmani Kingdom.\n\nThe lack of a strong centralised authority and constant battles over succession weakened the once-powerful dynasty.\n\nThe disintegration of the Bahmani Kingdom led to the emergence of smaller sultanates, known as the Deccan Sultanates, which continued to rule parts of the Deccan region.\n\nRelevant Blogs"
