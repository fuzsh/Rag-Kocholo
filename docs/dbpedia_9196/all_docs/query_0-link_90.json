        "text": "Hello guys. Hope you all continue to stay safe from the worst ever pandemic the world has witnessed. Well, I should keep asking this question I guess as usage of masks has been made mandatory at workplaces, at least at common areas at office like washrooms, cafeterias and gaming areas. Whatever be the reason for this awareness, let it continue as we should prevent yet another outbreak in India. Along with this awareness, politics also continue to cease within workplaces mainly favoring certain people for special tasks who will not be prominent in their work but knows all the dirty tricks to keep themselves safe. As I said in my previous posts, sometimes people will only for the dogs and not for the masters in the job as dogs lick everyone’s feet and will go behind everyone who shows them the bone or throws the stick towards them, shaking their tails. The intelligent masters who realise the fact will then never even mind them whatever be the worth of these dogs or how much efficient they are while working. These dogs will never miss out an opportunity to show off in front of new people coming in and will pretend that they have become someone most recognised at the company by getting chance to supervise them due to some bad timing for the real masters in the process. What these dogs do not realise is that in the end, the fate or to be apt karma will overturn in the favor of the real masters and they will in fact, end up as the real winners of the game. There will be a void which God would have left open which wouldn’t be visible to many as that is reserved only for the real masters to return to prominence and get the recognition they actually deserve. This is something which I’ve learned back to back from my life experiences and that made me what I am now. It is the last month of the year and the festival season continues. I’ve mentioned in my previous post about a journey I’ve made covering some of the heritage monuments in north western Karnataka. I’m planning for more journeys across Karnataka as well as other parts of the country. Thanks to Indian railways announcing special train services between many cities in South India, making it easier for tourists to travel between places. Before starting the post, let me talk about some of the new train services that have started during this festival season as well as prior to this which have enhanced the connectivity between cities and boosted tourism in the areas covered in the route. One such notable service which have started is between Mangaluru Junction and Vijayapura in Karnataka via Subrahmanya Road, Sakleshpur, Hassan, Arsikere, Davengere, Haveri, Hubballi, Gadag, Badami and Bagalkot. This is the first train service connecting the two cities and will enhance tourism in the route starting from the beaches and temple in Mangalore to the famous Kukke Subrahmanya Temple and from there to the hill station of Sakleshpur and then to Hassan, which can be considered as the gateway to Belur and Halebid and passing through many major cities to reach the second largest city of Karnataka, Hubballi and then to Badami, which was the capital of the Chalukyas and also the gateway to the monuments of Pattadakal and Aihole, through the city to Bagalkot to reach the city of Bijapur, which is famous for the Gol Gumbaz and other monuments of the Adil Shahi dynasty. Another train service has been started from Kollam to Vijayapura, which is the first train service from Kerala to Vijayapura thereby improving the chances of more tourists from Kerala to the region. A similar train service has also started from Kollam to Belagavi, which is also the first connecting Kerala to Belagavi. If the services are successful while running as special trains, then it is possible that the Indian Railways would start permanent services on the routes thus enhancing the rail connectivity between the states. These are just some of the notable services which have started recently owing to the festival season. There is another notable train route which is actually related to our post for the day which I’ll mention towards the end of this post. In our previous post, we traveled to Bidar to explore the Bahmani and Barid Shahi monuments, which are yet another group of monuments of the Deccan Sultanate. Today, we travel southwards from Bidar to cover the final group of monuments of the Deccan Sultanate. Let us start our tour of the monuments at Gulbarga.\n\nThe Gulbarga Fort is located in Kalaburagi in the Kalaburagi district of Karnataka. It was subsequently significantly enlarged in 1347 by Al-ud-din Hasan Bahmani of the Bahmani Dynasty after he cut off his ties with the Delhi Sultanate; Islamic monuments such as mosques, palaces, tombs, and other structures were also built later within the refurbished fort. The Jama Masjid built later, within the fort, in 1367, is a unique structure built in Persian architectural style, fully enclosed, with elegant domes and arched columns, which is unlike any other mosque in India. It was built to commemorate the establishment of the dynastic rule of the Bahmani kingdom at Kalaburagi fort between 1327 and 1424. It remained the capital of the Bahmani Kingdom till 1424 where after the capital was shifted to Bidar Fort, as Bidar had better climatic conditions. The early history of the region dates back to the 6th century when the Rashtrakutas ruled over the external areas, except Gulbarga. The Chalukyas won back their domain and ruled for over two hundred years. The Kalachuris of Kalyani succeeded them and ruled till the 12th century. At the end of the 12th century, it came under the reign of the Yadavas of Devagiri and the Hoysalas of Halebid. During this period, the Kakatiya dynasty, kings of Warangal were also powerful and took control of the present-day Kalaburagi district and Raichur district. The Kakatiya power was subdued in 1321, and the northern Deccan, including the district of Gulbarga, passed under the control of the Sultanate of Delhi. In the early 14th century, the Deccan was occupied by Muhammad bin Tughluq of the Delhi Sultanate, which included Gulbarga. The revolt of the Muslim officers appointed from Delhi resulted in the founding of the Bahmani Sultanate in 1347 by Alauddin Hassan, who chose Gulbarga (named as ‘Ahsenabad’ during this period) to be his capital. Gulbarga was the capital of the Bahmani kingdom (1347–1527) (with headquarters at the Gulbarga Fort), a newly founded independent state, until 1424 when the capital was transferred to Bidar. It is said that with the establishment of the Bahmani Kingdom, the Muslim rule took firm roots in the Deccan. Ahmad Shah Wali Bahmani had inducted immigrants from Iraq, Iran and Central Asia, which changed the social, cultural and religious life in the Deccan but was well amalgamated with Hindu traditions. The fort was razed to the ground by the Vijayanagar Emperor but was subsequently rebuilt by the Adil Shah dynasty or Bijapur Sultanate, when the Vijayanagar empire was defeated in battle of Talikota. The Bahmanis ruled over most of the Deccan until the late 15th and early 16th century, when the kingdom was divided into five independent states. The Mughal Emperor Aurangzeb (1658–1707) captured the fort in the 17th century (1687) and appointed Asaf Jah I (“Nizam-ul-Mulk”) as the governor of the Deccan. In the early part of the 18th century, when Mughal Empire was declining, the Nizam became independent in 1724, and formed the Hyderabad State, of which Gulbarga area was a part. The fort and the Gulbarga district were a part of Kingdom of Hyderabad under the Nizams rule. After India became independent in August 1947, Hyderabad state was annexed to the Indian union in 1948. In 1956, the Indian state of Hyderabad was partitioned among neighbouring states along linguistic lines and renamed as Andhra Pradesh (now Telangana). Most of the Gulbarga district became part of the then Mysore State, later renamed Karnataka, excluding two taluks, which were given to Andhra Pradesh. The fort is located on a plateau land in the northeastern part of Karnataka. Krishna River and Bhima River drain the district. The soil formation in the region is predominantly of black cotton soil. Fort is in the drought prone district and experiences a meagre average rainfall of 777 millimetres (30.6 in) with only 46 normal rainy days. Climate is dry and cold in the winter but summer is hot. South west monsoon brings rains. Temperature during summer is a high of 45 °C (113 °F), the minimum recorded in winter is 5 °C (41 °F).\n\nWith the establishment of the Bahmani Kingdom in the Deccan from 1347, the architectural styles of the Persian architecture of Iran made impressive and lasting impacts, which are seen in the fort. The mosques, arches, gardens, and the palaces were built within and also outside the fort in the Kalaburagi town. Within the fort, the buildings built are impressive with Indo-Persian architecture that evolved in the Deccan. Professor Desai has observed: ” A distinct Indo-Persian architectural style of Deccan came into existence after the establishment of the Bahmani dynasty in 1347.” Some of the important structures built are elaborated. The fort was originally built by and was subsequently substantially fortified in West Asian and European military architectural style by Alauddin Hasan Bahman Shah, the founder and first Sultan of the Bahmani Empire; particular mention is made of the citadel that was added in the centre of the fort. The fort has an area of approximately 57 acres (23 ha) and periphery length of 3 kilometres (1.9 mi). It is well fortified with double fortification. A 30 feet (9.1 m) wide moat surrounds the fort. The fort is a monumental structure highly fortified with 15 towers mounted with 26 guns; each gun located inside the fort is 8 metres (26 ft) long and is still well preserved. It is said that the Bahmani Sultanate claimed lineage of the Sasanians and the motifs on their buildings, particularly the crowns of the arches that they built depicted an emblem of the crescent and occasionally a disk that was closely reminiscent of the crowns of the Sassanian emperors. Many religious or secular buildings in the fort area depict this emblem. The Jami Masjid, one of the first in South India, was built to commemorate Gulbarga as the capital of the Bahmani Sultanate. The mosque though simple in design but has a symmetrical plan with well organized constituent parts. The masjid, only one of its kind in India, has dimensions of 216 feet (66 m)x176 feet (54 m) and was built on the lines of the Great Mosque of Córdoba in Spain. The masjid, which was in ruins, has been well tended now. The mosque has no open courtyard. The outer passageways surround the prayer hall on three sides and have low open arcades with arches. They form a rectangular layout with ten bays each on the north and the south, and seven bays on the east. The square bays on the corners are topped by domes. The roofed interior bays are covered with low domes, faceted by pendentives. The front yard in front of the mihrab has nine bays with a single large dome. Trefoil interiors and elongated lobes are seen on sloping arches of the drum. The main roof drum is mounted on a cubic clerestory. The wooden screens that existed on the outer arcade openings have been removed over the years. They have been replaced, in recent times, by an arched entrance portal on the north face. On the whole, the mosque displays distinct Persian architectural style with five large domes (One large and four small at the corners) and 75 small domes with 250 arches. Apart from the above monuments the other building of interest is the Tomb of the Sufi saint Syed Mohammad Gesu Daraz, popularly known as Khwaja Bande Nawaz, built in the Indo-Saracenic style. It is a large complex where the tomb of the Sufi saint, who came to Gulbarga in 1413, exists. The tomb walls have paintings; the arches of the Dargah are in Bahmani architecture while the paintings on the walls and ceiling have a fusion of Turkish and Irani influence. The Mughals also built a mosque close to the tomb. An annual fair or Urs is held here in November, which attracts large number of devotees of all religious communities. According to painter and scholar Rehman Patel, who provided the photograph and other details of the Feroze Shah lake, says that this rare photograph finds a place in the album that was made for the Nizam.\n\nA study of the 19th Century photographs in India would be incomplete without a study of the prolific works of photographs by Raja Lal Deen Dayal. At a time when the world of the photograph was dominated by British and European photographers, Mr. Dayal was the sole Indian who photographed extensively and was immensely sought-after. The sixth Nizam Mir Mahboob Ali Khan had conferred the prestigious ‘Musawwir Jung Raja Bahadur’ or ‘Bold Warrior of Photography’ title on Mr. Dayal. The Haft Gumbaz, also spelt Haft Gumbad are a group of tombs of the Bahmani dynasty situated in Gulbarga, in the Indian state of Karnataka. Built during the 14th and 15th centuries, the tombs are examples of early Indo-Islamic architecture. There are seven tombs in total, with four being tombs of the rulers of the Bahmani dynasty. The tomb complex is a monument of national importance, maintained by the Archeological Survey of India. The tomb complex was built between the 14th and 15th centuries. The capital shifted to Bidar in 1425, and the later Bahmani sultans are buried in the Bahmani tombs complex in Bidar. The tomb complex has been encroached by local businesses and institutions. A social activist, K.M. Mujeebuddin, has filed an RTI query regarding the upkeep of the tombs. The architectural style is reminiscent of Tughlaq architecture. A unique feature seen only in the Haft Gumbaz is the double-chambered tomb, with one chamber for the king and the other for his family members. There are seven tombs in total, with four being Sultan’s tombs. The tombs are situated in a garden. The Tomb of Mujahid Shah was the first tomb to be built. It is a single-chambered square tomb, free of any elaborate embellishments. It is located on a low base. It is on the West end of the tomb complex. The Tomb of Daud Shah is a double-chambered tomb. The ‘Monuments of the Deccan Sultanate’ is a serial property comprising of four component constitute the most representative, most authentic and best conserved examples of Deccani Sultanate monuments in India. The series demonstrates the exemplary convergence of national and international styles of Islamic architecture and their intersections with the prevalent Hindu architecture of the period southern Indian in present day Karnataka and Andhra Pradesh. The contributions of Deccan Sultanate to the arts and architecture of India is impressive with iconic Indo Islamic monuments constructed in Gulbarga, Bidar, Bijapur and Hyderabad. These sites emerged as important medieval fortifications and walled cities of the Deccan Sultanates with a vigorous new architectural style of the sultanate that emerged from encounters with the Deccan Hindu heartland of the period. Individually, each of the components of Deccan Sultanate cover important aspects of Sultanate history with Gulbarga evolving as the first capital of Bahmani Kingdoms in mid 14th Century CE including its impressive fortifications, Jami Masjid and royal tombs; Bidar as the next Bahmani capital in mid 15th Century CE; further evolution of the Deccani Sultanate style by Adil Shahi dynasty in the monuments at Bijapur such as the Gol Gumbaj that stands as the 2nd largest dome in world history; and the final diversification and manifestation of the style in the Qutub Shahi monuments of Golconda fort, tombs and the Charminar at Hyderabad. The 14th century Bahmani monuments at Gulbarga in Karnataka State primarily comprise of the Gulbarga Fort and Great Mosque in the Fort and the Haft Gumbad complex with seven tombs protected by the Archaeological Survey of India. Gulbarga as the first capital of the Bahmani dynasty had a fort. On the northwestern side of the city’s elliptical fort is the oldest township wherein is located the Shah Bazaar Mosque, which served as the Jami Mosque of Gulbarga. The tombs, darghas, and associated water bodies served as conceptual “protective” concentric circles around the fort, enclosing both parts of the city.\n\nConstructed on the remains of a Warangal fort built by Raja Gulchand, it was a nara durg with no natural defenses, dependent on the might of its men. Completely overhauled and reconstructed later by Alauddin Bahmani, it is an engineering feat of its time, with a 50 foot-thick double wall, the inner one higher than the outer. It displays an almost impregnable defense system with a 90 foot-wide moat with drawbridges completely surrounding its three miles of fortifications. Fifteen towers and 26 canons ensured it was one of the mightiest of all forts. The colossal western entrance has four gates and four courtyards, each one so fortified that it would be impossible to pass through any unscathed. It is an excellent example of military architecture. Inside are remains of large buildings, temples, and several beautiful courtyards. The large and foreboding Bala Hissar was used as the royal residence and certainly as a last refuge. Other Monuments in Gulbarga include, the Jami Masjid mosque and the Haft Gumbaz tomb complex. The Jami Masjid built in 1367 is awe-inspiring as it covers 38,000 square feet, and is a unique congregational courtyard for the region as it is covered. The Haft Gumbaz tombs include that of Mujahid Shah, Daud Shah, Ghiyath al-Din Shah and Shams al-Din Shah of the Bahmani dynasty. The Bahmani and Barid Shahi monuments at Bidar dating from late 15th to the early 16thcenturies, comprise of the Bidar Fort, the Madrasa Mahmud Gawan, the Bahamani tombs at Ashtur and the Barid Shahi tombs. The irregular, circular fort of Bidar, within which the royal palaces are located, is attached on its southern side to the quadrangular city. The six-mile long fort wall, built with huge stone blocks of reddish laterite stone is strengthened with 37 bastions, and has several gates with barbicans. Within the fort, two large mosques, the Jami Masjid and the Solha Khumba Masjid with sixteen pillars support a lofty dome, are also attributed to him. The significant achievement in Bidar is the sophisticated system of gates and sluices that could be used when required to flood segments of the moat and thus preserve water. The Madrasa of Mahmud Gawana occupies a rectangular structure covering 68 by 60 meters and encloses a central quadrangle. The main entrance, which is no longer extant, was to the east and led to the quadrangle with a dodecagonal cistern at its middle. The 12 tombs of Bahmani rulers in Ashtur were erected from 1436 to 1535. The tomb of Ahmad Shah I has a dome is most impressive rising over 30m high. The interior of the square tombs have beautifully colored and gilded paintings on the ceilings. Ali Barid’s tomb has a 25m high dome and stands in the middle of a symmetrical four square garden. The Adil Shahi monuments at Bijapur date from late 15th to the late 17th centuries. These are an ensemble of 80 small and big monuments including the fortifications, gates, water systems and tanks, several mosques and tombs and palatial structures. Bijapur lies within two concentric circles of fortifications. The outer city walls, extending more than six miles with extensive moats reinforced with 100 bastions it was built to accommodate heavy artillery. Its entrance gateways are accessed over heavily arched bridges, of which only two survive. The most remarkable monuments within the fort include: the Gol Gumbaz and other structures within its protected area, Ibrahim Rouza, Jehan Begum Tomb, Ainapur, Ain-ul-Mulk’s tomb, Ali II Rouza (Bara Kaman), Chand Bavdi, Gagan Mahal, Sangeeth & Nari Mahals, Navraspur, Jami Mosque, Asar Mahal, Ali 1 Rouza, Dakhani Idgah, Hyder Burz, Water Towers, Karimuddin’s Mosque, Mecca Masjid, Ramalinga Tank, Gummata Bavdi, Well at Ibrahimpur, Mahal in Field. The Jami Masjid is one of the finest mosques in India. Its courtyard measures to an enormous 9,000 square feet, later extended to 11,000 square feet and designed to accommodate 5,000 people. Without doubt, the Gol Gumbaz is the second largest dome in the world and the tomb of Muhammad Adil Shah. Its square base supports a dome some 150 feet high with a diameter of more than 100 feet covering a great hall of immense proportions. Many of the monuments and palace buildings have intricate murals and ornamentation.\n\nGolconda Fort, Qutb Shahi Tombs and Charminar are the landmarks that symbolize the Qutb Shahi Dynasty. Golconda is a fortified citadel and an early capital city of the Qutb Shahi dynasty. It is an ensemble of military structures, ramparts, gates, bastions, armoury; religious structures such as mosques, temples; residential structures such as palaces; water systems such as canals, fountains and landscaped gardens. The tombs of Qutb Shahis are a mausoleum complex, a royal necropolis of 30 tombs of the royal family and also a mortuary bath and mosques. The tombs belong to the rulers of the Qutb Shahi Dynasty spanning the 130-year period from 1543 to 1672. The iconic Charminar is a ceremonial Gateway built to celebrate the foundation of Hyderabad in 1591 A.D. Within its stone fortifications that is over seven kilometres long, the Golconda Fort envelopes a medieval Islamic settlement. The historic structures range from military and defensive structures, mortuary baths, silos, mosques, gardens, residential quarters, pavilions and royal courts, showcasing the entire range of structures that catered to life in a medieval fortified town in India. Within the citadel or Bala Hisar are the Silah Khana, Nagina bagh, Ambar Khana, Akkanna-Madanna Offices, Ramdas Jail, Darbar hall, Baradari, Hammams, Mahals, and royal courts. Between the 14th and the 17th century, the Deccan plateau of south-central India was home to a series of important and highly cultured Muslim courts. Subtly blending influences from Iran, West Asia, southern India, and sometimes Europe, as well as southern and northern India, the arts produced under these Deccan sultanates are markedly different from those of the rest of India and especially from those created under the Mughal patronage. Following the conquest of the powerful Vijaynagara empire in 1565 these Sultanate kingdoms emerged as the new force. They developed a unique mélange of Sultanate architectural idioms as a result of their cultural exchange. There was considerable movement of craftsmen and artists between the Muslim and Hindu domains, that contributed to shared cultural and architectural traditions. Such interaction embraced the borrowing of building techniques, architectural forms, and decorations that contributed to the development of a unique Deccani Architectural style. Further influences from Islamic traditions of Western and Central Asia as well as East Africa. The association of monumental, tripartite palaces structures with water, first seen in Bidar and then imitated in later capitals, is evidence of the influence of local traditions. By moving his capital to Bidar, Ahmad Shah tried to distance his rule from different Muslim factions that seem to have prevailed in Gulbarga. This distance from the past, and his intention to create a new identity from his kingdom, was further expressed in his choice of new architectural power-symbols, reflecting the political pragmatism the Deccani sultans, being as they were a Muslim elite ruling a Hindu majority. The Qutb Shahi monuments provide a unique testimony to the vibrant cosmopolitanism that characterized the medieval period in India and in the Deccan region in particular. Given that the founder of the dynasty and key nobles were immigrants from Iran, their integration with the Deccani Muslims, and the local Telugu-speaking Hindu elite was reflected in the innovative and inspired blending of Persianate and Indic cultures that flowed from the successful integration of this multi-ethnic society. The Monuments of the Deccan Sultanante are outstanding examples of military architecture, with an impregnable defense mechanism, unique water supply and distribution system, as well as unique sewage disposal mechanisms and extraordinary acoustical system unparalleled in the architectural history of the Deccan and the military architecture of South Asia. The fortifications of the Bahmanis and their successors can be classified according to their location into frontier, territorial and metropolitan forts. Forts were more or less permanent military camps, while walled cities were intended for the protection and prestige. Thus, they came to erect impressive stone forts and palaces and to promote ceremonials that could project them as agents of divine power in the imagination of their subjects. Five types of courtly structures are recorded at these localities, suggesting a conscious gradation of importance in early Bahmani ceremonial practices. Private complexes of the ruler and his representatives are marked with edifices distinguished by tripartite plans and facades.\n\nThe monuments and citadels provide a unique testimony to the social, economic, cultural, political and technological landscape of the period as well as unique expressions of the religious and artistic flowering of the Islamic Sultanate in Southern India. The monuments were also accompanied by the development syncretic forms of art, architecture, language, literature, music, cuisine and costume reflected subtly but perceptibly in the miniature paintings architecture and the Shi’a culture of the period. The close associations of Bahmani hammams with the rectangular, transverse-arched halls that have already been noted indicate that these bath houses may have had more formal functions. Later in Bidar and Bijapur, another device, generally termed the “Persian wheel”, was introduced and applied at some water bodies. A third device was also invented during the 17tf century at Bijapur. This device was invented to bring water under high pressure to fountains. During the second half of the 16th century another innovation was introduced in the Deccan to supply water to a palace or city over long distances. Bijapur and their palaces or gardens were partly provided with water from reservoirs or springs located some kilometers away. Until the 15th century water bodies were set within architectural frames made of dressed stone. Water specialists coming from Iran and other regions introduced novel techniques with an almost scientific approach to geological and physical realities. These specialists already had experience in obtaining more water from renewable sources. The use of lime mortar allowed them to build waterproof dams and to transport water over long distances. Unique in its architectural typology, the Charminar remains an acknowledged masterpiece of Islamic architecture. Qutb Shahi architecture began with Bahmani moorings and evolved a sophisticated architectural aesthetic within the Deccani paradigm, symbolising the zenith of Islamic Sultanate architecture in South India. Charminar’s most compelling quality is the originality of its unprecedented design that was to stylistically exercise a profound impact on the subsequent development of Deccani architecture. Functionally, it does not conform to any of the familiar building types from the Indo-Islamic world, but serves as a monumental marker for the central node in Hyderabad’s four-quartered design. Charminar is the archetype of the chaubara or “four-fold house” marking the intersection of four cardinal avenues, affording a series of impressive vistas. It is a singular monument as it embodies a singular design and ideas not seen in earlier structures. All four components of the serial nomination largely preserve their original form and design. The conservation works for the monuments have been carried out for over 100 years and thus they are in good state of preservation and maintain high level of integrity. This character has been scrupulously maintained by the custodian of the site, the Archaeological Survey of India. The properties at Bidar, Gulbarga and the principal monuments of Bijapur maintain their physical integrity and their layouts remain unaltered. Gol Gumbaz,at Bijapur, still dominates the city as it has done for four hundred years and it can be seen from surrounding land. Maintaining views is crucial to sustain and retain visual dominance. The construction material used for all monuments is primarily stone and lime with stucco and retained with minimal intervention for restoration in matching materials. Original paintings are intact. Apart from a number of minor structural repairs and regular maintenance that has been documented since the early nineteenth century, the buildings still exhibit their original structural fabric and design. In terms of their physical structure, the buildings utilize the traditional materials of mortared stone and carved stucco.\n\nAll four components of the serial nomination are protected under ASI and State Archaeology and function as tourist destinations at present. A number of Mosques and Madrasas continue to function as religious places for the local community. A number of mosques at Bijapur, Gulbarga and Bidar retain their original spiritual significance and related ceremonial use. The National law [Ancient Monuments and Archaeological Sites and Remains (Amendment & Validation) Act, 2010] legally permits the continuation of customary religious practices prevalent at the time of protection which helps in maintaining their historic use and function.All four components of the serial nomination are intact in their original historic location within the integral geographical setting of the Deccan Plateau in southern India. At the regional level, the most representative monuments of the Deccani Sultanate, the monuments at Gulbarga, Bidar, Bijapur and Golconda are part of the nominated serial property. Two more comparable Deccani period sultanate developments are the Nizam Shahi Ahmednagar in Maharashtra and Berar in Karnataka also belong to the series. However, these have been excluded in the proposed serial property since the existing monuments, forts, palaces and mosques of the Nizam Shahis at Ahmednagar no longer retain their original character while Bidar and Bijapur are more representative ones as compared to the Idam Shahi monuments at Berar in Karnataka. Contemporary Sultanate settlements to the Deccan Series, at national level, include the monumental contributions by the Central Delhi Sultanate with five Muslim dynasties (Slave 1206-1290; Khalji 1290-1320; Tughluq, 1320-1414; Sayyid 1414-45; Lodi 1451-1526) and provincial sultanates such as the Bengal Sultanate (1336-1576), the Jaunpur Sultanate (1394-1479), the Malwa Sultanate (1401-1531), the Gujarat Sultanate (1396-1583) and the Kashmir Sultanate (1346-1589). Amongst the monuments belonging to these Sultanates, the most comparable on World Heritage List are the Qutb Minar in Delhi and the Champaner-Pavgadh in Gujrat. Amongst the notable Mughal period monuments at national level are; The Red Fort and the Taj Mahal in Agra, the Fatehpur Sikri at Agra and Red Fort at Delhi that bear an exceptional and complementary testimony to a civilization which has disappeared, that of the Mughal Emperors. The Red Fort is considered to represent the zenith of Mughal creativity. The planning of the palace is based on Islamic prototypes, but each pavilion reveals architectural elements typical of Mughal building, reflecting a fusion of Persian, Timurid and Hindu traditions. Comparable Islamic monuments on World Heritage List and Tentative List associated with dynastic developments of medieval period including:The city of Balkh, Afghanistan with a secondary fortified area, the Balu Hisar; cities of the Merv oasis, their fortifications and their urban layouts in Turkmenistan; Berat and Gjirokastra in Albania are inscribed as rare examples of an architectural character typical of the Ottoman period; the citadel of Aleppo in Syria the citadel contains the remains of mosques, palace and bath buildings; Sheikh Safi al-din Khānegāh and Shrine Ensemble in Ardabil in Iran; Soltaniyeh in Iran: The mausoleum of Oljaytu was constructed in 1302–12 in the city of Soltaniyeh, the capital of the Ilkhanid dynasty founded by the Mongols; Tchogha Zanbil in Iran with the ruins of the holy city of the Kingdom of Elam; the Ensemble of Historical Sassanian Cities in Fars Province (Bishabpur, Firouzabad, Sarvestan) in Iran; At-Turaif District in ad-Dir’iyah, Saudi Arabia with the remains of many palaces and an urban ensemble built on the edge of the ad-Dir’iyah oasis; Bahla, Oman as a fortified oasis settlement of the medieval Islamic period; Historic Mosque City of Bagerhat in Bangladesh; and Thatta, Pakistan containing numerous mausolea and tomb. The above spectrum of World Heritage Sites recognizing the evolution, development and provincial/regional fusions of Islamic architecture and planning in various parts of the world establish the need for inclusion of the most representative and extant Islamic monuments of the Deccan Sultanate from southern India on the World Heritage List. In South Asia, Islamic architecture of the 14-18th centuries are so dominated by Moghul architecture that other provincial interpretations, such as the Deccan Sultanate serial proposed, provide an important counter narrative.\n\nThe Monuments and Forts of the Deccan Sultanate were inscribed in the tentative list of World Heritage Sites in 2014. The nomination is still waiting for its recognition as a UNESCO World Heritage Site. As I mentioned in my previous post, the only monument of the Deccan Sultanate I’ve visited is the Charminar of Hyderabad. In fact, that was a halt I made to visit the monument alone. It was while returning from Warangal, I halted at Hyderabad to visit its symbol. I traveled to Warangal to visit the Kakatiya monuments especially the Kakatiya Rudreshwara Temple popularly known as Ramappa Temple. I took the Yesvantpur-Jabalpur special train from Yesvantpur and got down at Kazipet Junction from where I took an auto to Hanamkonda. After getting fresh and having breakfast, I took the bus to Mulugu and on getting down there, took the bus going towards Palampet. From Palampet, I walked for around 3 kilometers to reach the gate of the temple. I spent around an hour at the temple before returning to Mulugu and from there to Hanamkonda. On getting down at Hanamkonda, I took the bus to Warangal city and then took an auto to the Warangal Fort which is famous for its gates known as the Kakatiya Kala Thoranam. I spent around an hour in the Fort before returning to Warangal city and then to Hanamkonda. On getting down at Hanamkonda, I went to the famous Thousand Pillar Temple and took a walk around it for maybe an hour and returned to my room. On the very next day morning after having breakfast, I took the bus to Kazipet and boarded the Visakhapatnam- Mumbai Lokmanya Tilak Terminus Express to reach Secunderabad. After having a light lunch, I boarded the train running on the Green Line of the Hyderabad Metro from the Secunderabad West and got down at the MG Bus Station from where I took a bus to Afzalganj and from there, I got a bus to Charminar. I got down in front of the minaret and then walked towards it. Bags are not allowed inside the monument and we have to leave them at nearby shops at a reasonable charge. After walking inside the Minar, I came out and took my baggage and took an auto to Afzalganj and from there took a bus to Nampally. Nampally is where the Hyderabad Deccan railway station is located and I just took a glance of the railway station and then took the metro from there to Malakpet. From Malakganj, I walked to the nearby bus stop and took the next bus to Kacheguda, from where my return train was starting. After having my dinner and waiting for around an hour or two, I boarded the Kacheguda-Mysore express and got down at Bangalore Cantonment from where I went to my room. It’s been more than a year since I went to Hyderabad but I never got a chance to share the details of my journey on the blog. It will take atleast 6-7 days if we are covering all the monuments of the Deccan Sultanate and there is road and rail connectivity between the cities too. I’m looking forward to cover all the monuments very soon either as separate or in a single journey.\n\nThat’s all I have about the monuments. Now, coming to sports across the globe. The 2022 FIFA World Cup is still in progress. There were many more upsets in the group stage. Belgium and Germany bowed out of the tournament in the first round. Belgium were held by Croatia for a goalless draw in the final game. Japan’s 2-1 win against Spain kicked Germany out of the World Cup. France lose 1-0 to Tunisia; Brazil lose 1-0 to Cameroon and South Korea beat Portugal 2-1 in the final group stage games. Netherlands will take on Argentina in the second quarterfinal while England will take on France in the fourth quarterfinal. Croatia will take on the winner of the tie between Brazil and South Korea in the first quarterfinal. The winner of the clash between Morocco and Spain will take on the winner of the game between Portugal and Switzerland in the third quarterfinal. England won the first test against Pakistan by 74 runs. Ollie Robinson was named the Player of the Match for his impressive bowling spell. India lost the one day international series against New Zealand 1-0 after the second and third matches being washed out. After the series loss to New Zealand, India lost the first one day international against Bangladesh by one wicket. KL Rahul was the top scorer for India with 73 while Shakib Al Hasan picked up 5 wickets and Ebadot Hossain picked 4 wickets. Mehidy Hasan Miraz steered Bangladesh in the chase with an unbeaten 38. Mehidy was named the Player of the Match for his match winning knock. The one day international series between Sri Lanka and Afghanistan was drawn 1-1 with Sri Lanka winning the final game by 4 wickets chasing down 314. Charith Asalanka was named the Player of the Match for his unbeaten 83 and Ibrahim Zadran was named the Player of the Series. Canada won the 2022 Desert Cup T20I Series by beating Oman by 8 wickets in the final. Saudi Arabia finished third in the series by beating Bahrain by 32 runs in the play-off. The 2022-23 ICC T20 World Africa Sub-regional Qualifier B has commenced in Rwanda. Nigeria, Tanzania, Ghana, Sierra Leone, Mozambique, Eswatini, Cameroon and Gambia will compete for two spots in the Regional finals which will be hosted by Namibia. After the Sub-regional qualifier, Rwanda will host the 2022 East Africa Series. The hosts will be joined by Kenya, Uganda and Tanzania in the series. The third and final round of the ICC Cricket World Cup Challenge League A has commenced in Malaysia. Underdogs Vanuatu and Malaysia have started with victories against top sides Singapore and Denmark. Canada continue to be the favorites for the tournament and started with a win against Qatar. Canada are in the race to recapture the one day international status which was lost after finishing outside the top 4 in the ICC World Cricket League Division 2. The 2022 Lanka Premier League will commence on 6 December. There are two more teams which we’ve got to talk about. The defending champions Jaffna Kings will have the services of Thisara Perera, Maheesh Theekshana, Praveen Jayawickrama, Dhananjaya de Silva, Binura Fernando, Sadeera Samarawickrama, Dilshan Madushanka, Avishka Fernando and Asitha Fernando. The squad also has a strong overseas contingent in Shoaib Malik, Rahmanullah Gurbaz, James Neesham, Tom Kohler-Cadmore, James Fuller and Waqar Salamkheil. The side will miss the services of Evin Lewis, Hardus Viljoen. Shahnawaz Dahani and Tristan Stubbs. The Kandy Falcons have made the most significant move by signing Wanindu Hasaranga from Jaffna Kings adding to the lineup that includes Kamindu Mendis, Chamika Karunaratne, Isuru Udana, Ashan Priyanjan, Minod Bhanuka, Malinda Pushpakumara and Pathum Nissanka. The side also got a strong overseas lineup which includes Carlos Brathwaite, Fabian Allen, Andre Fletcher, Oshane Thomas, Najibullah Zadran, Ahmed Daniyal and Zahoor Khan. Chris Green, Dewald Brevis and Usman Khan Shinwari will miss the tournament. Benny Howell has been signed by the Colombo Stars as a late signing while Ifthikar Ahmed, Mohammad Hasnain, Anwar Ali and Asad Shafiq have been signed up by the Galle Gladiators. Dambulla Giants have changed their name to Dambulla Aura. Deccan Gladiators have won the 2022 Abu Dhabi T10 League by beating New York Strikers by 37 runs in the final. David Wiese was named the Player of the Match of the final and Nicholas Pooran was named the Player of the Series. Morrisville Samp Army finished third by beating Team Abu Dhabi in the play-off. Usman Khan was named the best UAE player in the tournament. Tom Kohler-Cadmore was adjudged the best batsman of the tournament and Akeal Hosein won the honors for the best bowler of the tournament. The 2022-23 Big Bash League is also set to commence in a week. There were some notable signings as the tournament approached towards its start. Faf du Plessis have been signed up by the Perth Scorchers as a replacement for Laurie Evans for the first seven games. Phil Salt will also miss the tournament due to injury. David Willey has pulled out of the tournament and Sydney Thunder have signed Fazalhaq Farooqi as his replacement for the tournament. Liam Livingstone have pulled out of the tournament citing international workload. Andre Russell will replace him for the first four games before Martin Guptill joins the squad for the remainder of the tournament in the Melbourne Renegades squad. Shadab Khan will also miss some matches for the Hobart Hurricanes due to international commitments in which he will be replaced in the squad by Zak Crawley. Let us have a look at the draw for the Round of 16 play-offs of the 2022-23 UEFA Europa League:\n\nBarcelona (Spain) vs Manchester United (England)\n\nJuventus (Italy) vs Nantes (France)\n\nSporting CP (Portugal) vs Midtjylland (Denmark)\n\nShakhtar Donetsk (Ukraine) vs Rennes (France)\n\nAjax (Netherlands) vs Union Berlin (Germany)\n\nBayer Leverkusen (Germany) vs Monaco (France)\n\nSevilla (Spain) vs PSV Eindhoven (Netherlands)\n\nRed Bull Salzburg (Austria) vs Roma (Italy)\n\nReally shocking ties coming ahead in the race for the title especially the first one between Barca and United. Just like you, even I’m eagerly waiting to watch who will advance to the Round of 16.\n\nWell, that’s all I have for the day. Thus, we have concluded another journey to Northwestern Karnataka and also concluded the series of Deccan Sultanate monuments. As I mentioned in my previous post, there are some monuments that belong to Deccan Sultanate in Ahmednagar in Maharashtra. I’ve to do a bit more research before I compose a post on that. And, we need to try something different for our next post as we can’t continue sticking on to monuments of Deccan Sultanate in all our posts. Lol. I mentioned in the beginning of the post that there is something I’ve got to tell about train services which is related to the Deccan Sultanate monuments. Four express special trains have been announced on the railway route between Kalaburagi and Bidar, of which some have already started running, thus boosting the rail connectivity between the cities and more than that, tourism in the region. This will enable tourists to cover monuments in both the cities in a day or two as the journey on rail will not take more than 3 hours. Two Demu trains are also running in the route which run on all days except Sundays. The first express train to be flagged off was the Tirupati-Jalna special starting from the pilgrimage city of Tirupati passing through Renigunta, Kadapa, Guntakal, Mantralayam Road, Raichur, Wadi, Kalaburagi, Bidar, Parli Vaijnath and Parbhani to reach the industrial town of Jalna in Maharashtra. The train will reverse its direction at Bidar, Parli Vaijnath and Parbhani. Along with the cities of Deccan Sultanate, the train also connects pilgrimage centres of Tirupati, Mantralayam Road and Parli Vaijnath. The next train on the route is the Tirupati-Solapur special which follows a similar track till Latur Road after Bidar, before changing direction westwards passing through Latur, Osmanabad and Kurduwadi to reach Solapur. The train will reverse the direction at Bidar once again as a move to get more revenue from the service. The third service is the Yesvantpur-Hazur Saheb Nanded special which will start from Yesvantpur and passes through Hindupur, Penukonda, Dharmavaram before joining the route in the first service at Guntakal and then goes on till Parbhani before moving eastwards to reach the city of Nanded which is famous for its Hazur Saheb Gurudwara. This train will also reverse its direction at Bidar and also at Parli Vaijnath as in the first route. The fourth service is a bit weird one but still would have been started to boost revenue for the Indian Railways. The train is to run between Solapur and Mumbai Lokmanya Tilak Terminus and passes through Kalaburagi, Bidar, Latur Road, Latur, Osmanabad, Kurduwadi, Daund, Pune, Panvel and Thane. What makes this journey weird is that the actual rail distance between Solapur and Kurduwadi is 80 kilometers but this train covers more than 400 kilometers to reach Kurduwadi. Lol. Then a passenger who can’t board the train in the morning from Solapur just need to travel 80-90 kilometers to reach Kurduwadi to catch the same train at night. Trial run has started on the railway line between Teni and Bodinayakkanur. It is expected that the first train will run on the converted track by January to reach the town of Bodinayakkanur. As of now, trains are running till Teni and once extended, we can expect the announcement of many express trains as well on the route, thus boosting the tourism in the area. Railways and tourism are two different sectors but are linked to each other as sometimes trains are the most convenient of transport to cover places. As I mentioned in my previous post and at the beginning of this post, I’ve been on a tour for few days and planning to go on another in the next few days. I have to combine my pictures into a video and reactivate my YouTube channel The 87 Ticket. Once again, thank you all for your valuable feedback and support given to the blog. Requesting you all to stay safe and make the use of masks and sanitisers a must in your daily life and also get vaccinated with two doses in case you haven’t. For now, keep calm and enjoy the journey through the Bahmani monuments of Gulbarga."
