They were numerous but not warriors of Rajput caliber.\n\npigs fly and donkeys sing.\n\nHe didnt do political correctness to appease Hindu nationalist like you , and didnt twist the facts from primary sources such as Tarikh-i-Ferishta, Futuh-us-salatin, Tazkira-salatin-dakan, Burhan-i-Ma'asir, Matla-us-sadain, Tuhfatu-salatin etc, like a proper academician. What ever i have shared in the opening, he has provided extensive notes and references for it at the end of the chapter which i have skipped along with the the side details in the chapter itself.\n\nYour random use of the words like \"Hindu nationalists\" won't give any more legitimacy to your claim. According to Ferishta himself concluding treaty at the end of the war recognized Krishna river as boundary between two polities. If Bahamanis were indeed as successful in thrashing Vijayanagar as Ferishta wants us to believe then they would have gained control of the territory south to Krishna. But rather the territory ended up being part of Vijayanagar (with some territory under mutual control of both). So unless or until we assume that Ferishta also wants us to believe that Bahmanis were stupid and ..... that even after thrashing Vijayanagar completely couldn't manage make any substantial gains, there is no reason to take whatever he says on face value. The only thing in which Bahmanis were expert at was the whole sale massacre of population.\n\nYour random use of the words like \"Hindu nationalists\" won't give any more legitimacy to your claim.

Keeping it as tributary was more beneficial. So it was their policy to not outstretch themselves too thin by expanding southwards. They also didnt expand Northwards. When Bahmani sultanate split into five pieces, its Bijapur and golconda pieces had no choice but to increase its territoty southwards, they made their mind and they did it successfully, annihilating the Vijaynagar empire in the process. So if the two smaller split away states from bahmani could absorb Vijaynagar, why you think their parent Bahmani was not capable of it?. Due to disslution of Afghan empires and chiefdoms at the hands of Mughals, large number of soldiers were available to Deccan sultanates to deal with vijaynagar efficiently and maintain the occupation in conquered territories.\n\nBy giving a read to the history of Bahmanis, it appears to me that militarily they had upper hand over Vijaynagar, not only they repulsed every invasion from the latter but also made counter-invasion on most of the occasion, penetrating deep into vijaynagar empire and levying tribute from them.

They were numerous but not warriors of Rajput caliber.\n\nYou obviously have zero knowledge of martial culture of the south which was much fiercer than that of the north. Also Vijayanagar usually engaged in a conventional style of warfare. It was Musunuri Kapaneed who fought a guerilla style war.\n\nAgain spectacular ignorance as expected from a Pak propagandist.\n\nBahmanis could have conquered Vijaynagar, but they knew that they wont be able to keep the occupation and rule vast kingdom of Vijaynagar with entirely Hindu population.

Considering the penchant of Bahmanis for barbaric massacres of large scales (essentially hallmark of all .....i armies), if they would have indeed got the chance they would have inflicted same sort of barbarism on Vijayanagar, too (and Ferishta would have sang glorious paeans to such massacres) The war started because according Ferishta It was Vijayanagar who wanted territories adjacent to Raichur and Mudgal under their control. According to same Ferishta war ended with a treaty giving areas below Krishna river to Vijayanagar and by doing so he pretty much contradicts himself...unless or until we assume that Ferishta was trying to assert that Bahmanis were stupid.\n\nAnd the Vijayanagar that Deccani sultanates faced wasn't the same Vijayanagar pitted against Bahmanis. Not to mention that even for the Deccani sultanates it almost took a century to annex the weakened Vijayanagar devoid of much support form its subordinates post Talikota. If they took almost century for them to dissolve a weakened crumbling empire there is no reason to believe that they had any capacity to take Vijayanagar in its hey days.\n\nBy giving a read to the history of Bahmanis, it appears to me that militarily they had upper hand over Vijaynagar, not only they repulsed every invasion from the latter but also made counter-invasion on most of the occasion, penetrating deep into vijaynagar empire and levying tribute from them.

They were numerous but not warriors of Rajput caliber.\n\nYou need to read better sources than Ferishta. Its easy to prove that Vijayanagara held the upper hand over the Bahamani Sultanate, since we have independent record of the Bahamani kings ceding land to end hostilities. Vijayanagara kings didn't cede land, they never recognized the Bahamani encroachment.\n\nAlso, Vijayanagara had two adversaries- Bahamani and the Gajapatis, with the Gajapatis being the superior one. Bahamanis had only one adversary, Vijayanagara."
