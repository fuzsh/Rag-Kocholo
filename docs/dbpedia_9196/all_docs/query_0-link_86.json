        "text": "YUSUF ADIL SHAH’S RIVERSIDE PLEASURE PALACE in Goa is a well-earned retreat for the Sultan. His newly-formed Sultanate has its fair share of attacks to fend off. But once he manages to dismantle a key confederation of enemies, he enjoys some measure of peace. There is no shortage of relaxation zones to choose from, but Goa is his favourite retreat by far, given its balanced natural beauty and cosmopolitan charms afforded by a steady flow of traders from Zanzibar to Ceylon. They dock at this important port city for the procurement of spices and cotton, and catching up with essential merchant news and intrigues.\n\nHis Goan retreat palace overlooks the idyllic Mandovi river, around which a great city, Ella (Old Goa), had been built under the supervision of Mahmood Gawan, the accomplished Prime Minister of the erstwhile Bahmani Sultanate, who wrested Goa from the Vijayanagar Empire. While the city had already known a measure of glory as early as the 10th Century under the Kadambas, Gawan developed Goa into an important port city that attracted major merchant vessels. With the disintegration of the Bahmanis, Goa passed on to Yusuf Adil Shah’s Bijapur Sultanate. Yusuf Adil Shah lost no time in advancing its prestige and he commissioned the creation of shipbuilding facilities at the Goan port. Vessels built here would carry local pilgrims on their annual transit to Mecca. Goa, for long a name well known to merchants on the Indian Ocean circuit, is now a trade emporium of repute.\n\nSo what would the Sultanate of Bijapur treat himself to at his Goan retreat? No doubt he would take a ride down the river now and then. Meal times would feature a bountiful array of freshwater and sea food. But what of the flavours? We can speculate that Adil Shah had a fair exposure to West Indian cuisine, courtesy his Marathi wife, Satti Bai. But being from Indapur (a hotter, drier part of Western Maharastra), her culinary background would not have too much in common with that of the more fertile, diverse Konkan coast. Tamarind, jaggery, kokum, coconut oil, curry leaves are highlights of the entire stretch of the Konkan Coast. Rice, coconut, sugarcane, colocasia, drumstick and gourds are ancient foods of this land. Tamarind and in goa, kokum in particular, account for the sour quotient in the still extant pre-Portugese Goan cuisine. Other early and continuing agents of sour in Goan cuisine include raw mango and bimbal.\n\nThe Bijapur Sultan may well have indulged in the pre-Portugese specialty known as xacuti. This is a stew of chicken or mutton, spiced with the great ingredients of the Konkan coast including, pepper, coconut, tamarind and mace. He would in all probability wash down that meal with a goblet of sol kadhi, a subtly pungent, pink drink of coconut milk, sweetened, soured and coloured with kokum.\n\nAt this stage, vinegar, chillies, tomatoes, and potatoes have not announced themselves to the Goan palette. But we will find, their eventual harbingers – the Portugese – are just round the corner, and Yusuf Adil Shah will be taken by surprise when they land unannounced on the shores of his special port city, aggressive ambitions in tow.\n\nRESOURCES\n\nA History of the Deccan, by James Dunning Baker Gribble\n\nGoa Through the Ages: An economic history, Volume 2, by Teotonio R. De Souza\n\nGoa and Mumbai, by Amelia Thomas, Amy Karafin\n\nThe Penguin Food Guide to India, by Charmaine O’ Brien\n\nUpper Crust: A Saraswat Way of Life\n\nForgotten, by Bilkees I Latif\n\nWikipedia\n\nTHE NEXT KEY DEVELOPMENTS occur under Sultan Muhammed Shah who is all of nine when he assumes the throne. Thankfully, it is a while before he exercises real authority. When he does, he displays qualities that honour his role as captain of the Bahmani destiny, however his impatience and temper will prove the undoing of the dynasty. Instead his rule will stand out for the flowering of someone else in his ranks: Yusuf Adil Shah. This industrious officer will go on to establish a dynasty of his own, and this appears to be his due, however he gets there by excelling in the service of the above mentioned flawed Sultan.\n\nSo, who is Yusuf Adil Shah? Some say he was Georgian slave who was bought in Iran. A more popular version serves a more sensational story: he was the son of the Sultan of Turkey, Murad II. As a young boy, he was forced to flee his home country in the succession battle that ensued following his father’s death. His mother had him taken away to Persia for a safe upbringing under the wings of the Suffee royal family, in the town of Saweh. On turning sixteen, he decides to set off for India, following a strong personal belief that this is where his destiny lies. His instinct guides him well, for in the years after his arrival, he steadily wins the confidence of important people till he finds himself mentored by Khajeh Gawan, principal minister in the Bahmani Sultanate.\n\nWhether Yusuf Adil Shah is aware of it or not, by going to India, he takes himself to the birthplace of what will become Turkey’s favourite vegetable – the brinjal / aubergine. This enchanting member of the nightshade family will inspire a beguiling oil-based dish that legend holds had the power to make an imam faint under its spell – the imam bayildi. To stretch the connection a little more, Yusuf Adil Shah’s journey from Turkey and the Persian Gulf to Hindustan, is the journey of the brinjal in reverse.\n\nAs for the Bahmani reagent he serves, Sultan Muhammed Shah for all his failings manages to do a good job of holding off challenges and even making gains, due in large part to a talented team exemplified by the likes of Yusuf Adil Shah and his mentor, Khajeh Gawan. In the end however, the Sultan’s poor insight and temper, proves to be not only his undoing but the undoing of the Bahmani Sultanate. After putting Khajeh Gawan to death as punishment for a letter that turns out to be forged by the minister’s enemies, the Sultan is deserted by his key Governors who are shocked by the rash elimination of a trusted and admired prime minister.\n\nREFERENCES\n\nA History of the Deccan, by James Dunning Baker Gribble\n\nIndian Food, A Historical Companion, by KT Achaya\n\nTHE NEW SULTAN – MAHMOOD – will come to be known as the Second Aristotle. Well versed in the local dialect as well as Persian and Arabic, he is a gifted poet and now in the position of Sultan, patronizes some of the finest poets from West and Central Asia. Gulbarga becomes a magnet for artists and poets from West Asia. The Sultan pays equal attention to details of administration and justice as he does to verse. He is conscientious leader. During a famine, he personally pays for the despatch 10,000 bullocks to as far as Gujarat, to bring back wheat to provide for his people at a subsidy. Beloved of his people, Sultan Mahmood sets scrupulous standards for himself. As a prince, he had a reputation for being up-to-date on and setting fashion trends, but in the role of Sultan he will only be seen in plain white clothing. Here is a leader who saw himself as a trustee of his kingdom’s wealth and to his credit, he managed it with good judgement unquestionable taste.\n\nThe Sultan extends an invitation to Hafiz – Persia’s revered poet-mystic – going so far as to send a sum of money to cover his journey to the Deccan. Hafiz accepts the invitation and boards the ship at Hormuz but after a sudden storm, the ship turns back to port , shortly after setting sail. Shaken by the incident, Hafiz decides to return to his home country. He makes it a point to compose a poem for the Bahmani Sultan by way of excusing himself and also to honour the king for his consideration:\n\n… When I thought of your pearls, it seemed then to me\n\nTo risk a short voyage would not be too bold;\n\nBut now I am sure, one wave of the sea\n\nCannot be repaid by treasures of gold.\n\nWhat care I for pearls or for gems rich and rare\n\nWhen friendship and love at home both are mine?\n\nAll the gilding of art can never compare\n\nWith the pleasure derived from generous wine!\n\nLet Hafiz retire from the cares of the world,\n\nContented with only few pieces of gold …\n\nHad Hafiz reached Gulbarga, he would not have found himself at sea on the front of cuisine. Accounts of travellers to Delhi (with a similar court culture) at the time speak of drinks of sherbet and fuqqa (made from barley). Meals featured thin loaves of bread known as khubi, stuffed breads and preparations of roast sheep meat and fowl. At a private dinner in Delhi, the Moroccan traveller Ibn Batutta remarked at a preparation known as sambusak (samosa), suggesting it was a novelty for him and that he was encountering this dish for the first time, in India.\n\nREFERENCES\n\nA History of the Deccan, by James Dunning Baker Gribble\n\nMeaning of Islamic Art, by K.K. Aziz\n\nHistory of the rise of Mahomedan power in India, by Muḥammad Qāsim Hindū-Šāh\n\nThe Literary Gazette: A Weekly Journal of Literature, Science, and the Fine Arts (1829)\n\nCELEBRATIONS AROUND THE NEW THRONE, feature wine, at least in the Court. One particular event combines that with a spectacular performance by 300 singers brought in from Delhi specially for the event. Flushed and energised after their performance, the Sultan orders his Minister to reward the troupe with a draft on the treasury of the neighbouring Kingdom of Vijayanagar. Audacious as it is, what makes the demand even more reckless is the detail that Vijayanagar is one of the strongest kingdoms of the South at the moment – a rival to be feared.\n\nThe capital of the Vijayanagar Empire of the 16th Century will be described by Portugese visitors, as the “best provided city” in the world. Its markets are stocked with excellent home grown grains, millets and vegetables. It is described as abounding in oranges, limes, grapes, brinjals, and a stupefying range of green vegetables. Popular vegetables included plantians, pumpkins, gourds, and cucumber. This is a prosperity built on unrivalled political strategy. But right now, in the 14th Century, it would be fair to say that the fledgling kingdom of Vijayanagar is still learning the ropes.\n\nThe Bahmani forces vanquish the superior forces of Vijayanagar and the Bahmani Sultan has the satisfaction of seeing his draft honoured. Almost as soon as he concludes this matter, he is informed of a revolt at Daulatabad. Here too, his venture ends in victory. In Daulatabad, he makes the acquaintance of an inspired fakir who persuades him to abstain from wine. The Sultan of course will of course go one step further and have all distilleries in his capital destroyed.\n\nBut there remains a variety of other drinks to enjoy – fruit juices including the juice of pomegranate and the madala fruit. There is also the trusty milk and buttermilk concoctions. For those unfortunate residents who missed their fix of liquor, they’d probably make plans to visit neighbouring kingdoms where they would have their fill at toddy shops and nibble on salted snacks in between.\n\nSultan Mohammed Shah I returns to his capital with the major battles of his career behind him. The best of these prove to be master classes in strategy, extracting victory with limited forces. At the end of his life and rule, the treasury of Gulbarga has amassed enormous reserves and the Bahmani Sultanate has earned a redoubtable reputation in the Deccan, whose fortunes the Sultanate will decide for some time to come.\n\nREFERENCES\n\nA History of the Deccan, by James Dunning Baker Gribble\n\nFood and Food Habits in Vijayanagara Times, by Jyotsna Burde\n\nNEW KINGS ARE SENSITIVE to effrontery – imagined and actual. In the case of the new Bahmani Sultan Mohammed Shah, all it takes is a gift of horses. On confronting the team of dealers on the clearly substandard steeds, he is peeved to hear that the original faultless specimens were replaced on the orders of a ruler whose territories they had passed through. So it’s off to Telangana again, where the unapologetic Raja gets the worst from the slighted Sultan. Revenge may have been extracted, but on their return trip back to Gulbarga, the Bahmani army is taken to the cleaners and return severely depleted. Thus begins a long standoff between the new Sultanate and one of their equally combative neighbours. Soon enough, the neighbouring Kingdom proposes some kind of truce. While initially uncertain, Sultan Mohammed caves in when he is told that it will be sealed with the gift of a special jewelled throne.\n\nThis is no ordinary throne. This gold plated, ebony seat stretches to a length of nine feet and is encrusted with jewels which are designed to be detached and replaced as needed. A verbal account of its details is sufficient to persuade the Sultan to give in to the plan. The throne has a name of its own – Firozeh – after its sky blue enamelling.\n\nWhen the jewelled throne finally finds its way to the Court at the Bahmani capital of Gulbarga, the buntings and troupes are called out. The silver throne of his father is down over to the treasury, the new seat is placed in the Durbar hall and the Sultan calls for feasting and celebrations. The gift of the jewelled throne succeeds where it was meant to: it secures a degree of peace for the neighbouring kingdom of Telengana and of course secures the Raja’s position. A throne for a throne.\n\nCoincidentally, centuries later, a Mughal ruler by the same name (Mohammed Shah) will have to do the opposite and turn over the priceless Peacock Throne to appease the rampaging forces of Nadir Shah. In other cases, a tangible throne will not be enough – what matters is total, unobstructed power. Such will be the case with Aurangzeb. Incensed at having to hear of his brother, Dara Shikoh’s natural claim to the throne, he hires assassins who break into Dara’s home just while he is preparing a meal of khichdi for his son and himself.\n\nREFERENCES\n\nA History of the Deccan, by James Dunning Baker Gribble\n\nTravels in the Mogul Empire, AD 1656-1668, by Francois Bernier\n\nLalla Rookh: an oriental romance by Thomas Moore, by Thomas Moore"
