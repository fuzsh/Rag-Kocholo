This topic has relevance in the Art and Culture section of the UPSC CSE exam.\n\nGS 1: Art and Culture\n\nWhy in the news?\n\nThe Karnataka High Court has instructed the authorities in the Kalaburagi district to eliminate encroachments from the historic fort of the Bahmani Sultans situated in the city.\n\nFoundation and Territorial Expansion\n\nEstablishment by Hasan Bahman Shah: The Bahmani Sultanate, or Bahmanid Empire, was established in 1347 by Ala-ud-Din Hasan Bahman Shah, a governor who declared independence from the Delhi Sultanate and made Gulbarga the capital.\n\nTerritorial Expansion: The empire, under rulers like Muhammad Shah I and Firuz Shah, expanded its territories, including Gulbarga, Bidar, Bijapur, and Golconda (modern-day Hyderabad), solidifying its influence in the Deccan region.\n\nAdministration and Governance\n\nFeudal System: Administrative divisions included Daulatabad, Bidar, Berar, and Gulbarga, each governed by tarafdars or subedars. A decentralized feudal system empowered provincial rulers known as walis or nayaks.\n\nCentral Administration: Centralized administrative structures managed revenue, justice, and military affairs, ensuring effective governance.\n\nCultural and Socio-Economic Development\n\nPatronage of Arts and Culture: The Bahmani rulers fostered art, literature, and architecture, contributing to the development of the distinctive Deccani culture. Notable structures included Gulbarga’s Jama Masjid, Bidar’s Rangeen Mahal, and Bijapur’s Gol Gumbaz.\n\nPromotion of Regional Languages: The Bahmani court supported local languages such as Dakhni and Kannada, contributing to the growth of regional literature.\n\nEconomic Prosperity: The strategic location of the sultanate facilitated flourishing trade in horses, textiles, and spices, contributing to economic prosperity.\n\nReligious Policies\n\nReligious Tolerance: The sultans pursued a policy of religious tolerance, fostering peaceful coexistence among Hindus, Muslims, Jains, and Christians.\n\nPromotion of Syncretic Culture: The Bahmani Sultanate’s cultural landscape reflected the syncretic blending of diverse religious traditions and practices.\n\nDecline and Fragmentation\n\nInternal Strife and Dynastic Conflicts: Internal conflicts and power struggles among the nobility weakened the unity of the Bahmani Sultanate.\n\nRise of Five Successor States: In 1527, the sultanate fragmented into five independent states known as the Deccan Sultanates—Ahmadnagar, Bijapur, Golconda, Berar, and Bidar—marking the end of the Bahmani Sultanate.\n\nFragmentation and Emergence of Deccan Sultanates:\n\nAfter the military campaigns led by Krishnadeva Raya of the Vijayanagar Empire, the once-unified Bahmani Sultanate splintered into five distinct states, collectively known as the Deccan Sultanates. Each of these successor states operated independently, contributing significantly to the cultural, artistic, and political landscape of the Deccan region.\n\nAhmadnagar Sultanate: Established under the rule of Ahmad Nizam Shah I.\n\nBijapur Sultanate: Established by Yusuf Adil Shah.\n\nGolconda Sultanate: Founded by Quli Qutb Shah.\n\nBerar Sultanate: Ruled by Fathullah Imad-ul-Mulk.\n\nBidar Sultanate: Established by Amir Barid.\n\nBattle of Talikota (1565):\n\nThe culmination of tensions between the Deccan Sultanates and the Vijayanagar Empire resulted in the catastrophic Battle of Talikota in 1565. This pivotal conflict led to the downfall of the Vijayanagar Empire, reshaping the political dynamics of the Deccan.\n\nMughal Annexation:\n\nSubsequently, the Mughal Empire, particularly under the reigns of Akbar and later Aurangzeb, extended its dominion over the Deccan Sultanates. This marked the final chapter in the Bahmani legacy, as the Mughals integrated the once-independent Deccan Sultanates into their vast empire, bringing an end to their distinct political identity.\n\nDownload Yojna daily current affairs eng med 19th Dec 2023\n\nQ.1 Consider the following pairs:\n\nAhmadnagar Sultanate : Ahmad Nizam Shah I\n\nBijapur Sultanate : Quli Qutb Shah\n\nGolconda Sultanate : Yusuf Adil Shah\n\nBerar Sultanate : Amir Barid\n\nHow many of the above pairs are correctly matched?\n\n(a) Only one\n\n(b) Only two\n\n(c) Only three\n\n(d) All four\n\nANSWER: A"
