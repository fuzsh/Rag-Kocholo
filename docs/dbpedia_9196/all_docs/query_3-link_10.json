        "text": "Gulbarga is a city steeped in history through the ages. While ‘Gulbarga’ in Urdu means ‘garden of flowers’, its official name is the Kannada ‘Kalaburagi’ which means ‘Stone fort’. The fascinating story of this city goes back to the sixth century. Initially, under the control of Hindu empires including the Chalukyas, Rashtrakutas, Kalahari, Yadavas, Hoysalas and the Kakatiyas, the Muslim rulers of the Delhi Sultanate eventually got control of the region. Mohammed bin Tughlaq is said to have been fond of the city.\n\nAfter a revolt, the Bahmanis came to power under Zafar Khan Alauddin Hasan Gangu. Under his regime, Gulbarga gained fame as the capital of the empire. This was eventually annexed by the Mughals, who undertook many architectural projects around the city. In the eighteenth century, Gulbarga was taken over by the princely state of Hyderabad. After independence, it eventually found its way to the state of Karnataka. The tumultuous history of the region lends it its unique culture and heritage – you can expect to see buildings from different parts of history and architectural styles.\n\nGulbarga is located in North Karnataka, where Kannada is the prominent language. The characteristic dialect of Gulbarga Kannada is easy to understand if you have a basic idea of the language. Urdu and Marathi are also spoken by most of the locals. You can find your way around with Hindi as well. Tour guides and vendors near tourist locations speak English, as do most taxi drivers. It is recommended that you learn a few phrases of Hindi or Kannada before you make your way to this historic city. The locals are friendly and helpful. Most signboards carry instructions in English and the local language.\n\nGulbarga is famous for its colourful festivals. The Urs Festival held annually at the tomb of Khwaja Bande Nawaz brings thousands of visitors to the region. Held in August, this event commemorates the death anniversary of the mystic.\n\nAnother must-visit celebration is the annual Car festival of the Sharana Basaveshwara Temple. Held in March, this event sees a brilliantly decked up chariot which carries the deity around the city. Celebrated with joy and revelry over a period of two weeks, the Car festival hosts international visitors too.\n\nSouvenir shopping is effortless at Gulbarga because of the abundance of trinkets, jewellery and showstoppers on display. Handicrafts are especially sought after here – keep an eye out for intricate designs on sandalwood, rosewood and teak. From small souvenirs like jewellery to huge statues of animals and gods, the woodwork industry of Gulbarga thrives like never before. Bidriware items are in great demand as well. Composed of delicate designs of gold and silver to embellish goblets, vases, pipes and wall hangings, these are sure to make for memorable gifts! Women's’ clothing including Saris and Kurtas in cotton and pure silk are perfect souvenirs for loved ones. Incense sticks are famous in Gulbarga – choose from a range of natural, organic fragrances to spice up your vibe.\n\nThe best time to visit Gulbarga is between the winter months of October and March. During this time, the average temperature is 25°C, which is cosy and comfortable. In the summer months between March and June, it gets scorchingly hot in Gulbarga – temperatures go as high as 40°C, making travel very difficult. Monsoon strikes the region at the end of June and extends till the end of September. Gulbarga sees heavy rains, which may hamper your travel plans. The rains tend to slow down as the year ends, so you can still visit the region in September.\n\nRead More"
