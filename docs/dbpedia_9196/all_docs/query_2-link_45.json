        "text": "UPSC NCERT Notes – Medieval History – Vijayanagara and Bahmani Kingdoms\n\nThe Bahmani and the Vijayanagara were the two great empires that arose in the Deccan. These kingdoms dominated South India and Deccan for more than 200 years. The control over Raichur Doab was the main issue that resulted in the long Bahmani Vijayanagara struggle.\n\nTable of Contents\n\nToggle\n\nThe Origin of the Vijayanagara Empire:\n\nThe Vijayanagara Empire witnessed the reign of four dynasties: Sangama, Saluva, Tuluva, and Aravidu.\n\nEstablished in AD 1336 by Harihara and Bukka of the Sangama Dynasty, the empire had its roots in the service of the Kakatiya ruler, Prataparudra II, by the two Sangama brothers.\n\nFollowing the Muslim conquest of the Kakatiya kingdom in AD 1323, the brothers served in the kingdom of Kampili in modern Karnataka as ministers in the royal court. However, they were later imprisoned and converted to Islam by Muhammad bin Tughlaq.\n\nHaving initially established control over Kampili on behalf of the Sultan, the Sangama brothers reverted to Hinduism under the guidance of Saint Vidyaranya. They declared independence and, in AD 1336, founded a new city on the South bank of the Tungabhadra, known as Vijayanagara (City of Victory) or Vidyanagara (City of Learning). The capital of the kingdom was Hastinavati (Hampi).\n\nThe Bahmani Sultans emerged as rivals to Vijayanagara, leading to numerous battles. The contested regions included the Tungabhadra Doab (between Krishna and Tungabhadra), Krishna-Godavari Delta, and the Konkan areas of Marathwada.\n\nSources of the Vijayanagara Empire\n\nDynasties and Rulers Under the Vijayanagara Empire\n\nThere were four dynasties that ruled over Vijayanagara i.e., Sangama Dynasty, Saluva Dynasty, Tuluva Dynasty, and Aravidu Dynasty.\n\nMajor Rulers of the Sangama Dynasty\n\nNotable rulers of the Sangama Dynasty include:\n\nHarihara I (AD 1336-1356)\n\nThe founder of the Sangama Dynasty, Harihara I actively participated in the confederacy led by Krishna Nayak of Warangal in AD 1344, aiming to oust Muslims from the Deccan.\n\nHe established Anegundi (Karnataka) as his initial capital and later Vijayanagara (Hampi) as the second capital.\n\nExploiting the decline of the Hoysala kingdom, Harihara and Bukka expanded their newly established realm, eventually bringing the entire Hoysala kingdom under their control by 1346.\n\nWithin the first two decades, Harihara I extended his dominion south of the Tungabhadra River, earning the title of Purvapaschima Samudradhishavara (master of the Eastern and Western seas). He progressively expanded to encompass regions of the Konkan and Malabar Coast.\n\nThe Vijayanagara kingdom absorbed the Kadambas of Banavasi along the Konkan Coast. Following Harihara I’s demise, his brother Bukka I assumed the throne as the fifth emperor of the Sangama Dynasty.\n\nBukka I (AD 1356-1377)\n\nInscriptions depict Bukka I as the sovereign of the Eastern, Western, and Southern oceans.\n\nHe played a crucial role in reconciling Jains and Vaishnavas by endorsing their freedom to worship according to their respective beliefs.\n\nBukka Raya expanded the empire’s territory by conquering numerous kingdoms in Southern India.\n\nIn AD 1360, Bukka I successfully subdued the Reddis of Kondavidu and the Shambuvaraya kingdom of Arcot, consolidating control over the surrounding area, including Perakonda. By AD 1371, he further extended his influence by overthrowing the Madurai Sultanate, reaching as far as Rameswaram in the South.\n\nBukka I’s son, Kamara Kampana, played a significant role in these campaigns, as documented in his wife Gangambika’s Sanskrit work, “Madura Vijayam.” During Bukka Raya’s rule, the Vijayanagara Empire established its capital at Vijayanagara on the South bank of the river.\n\nBukka also engaged in conflicts with the Bahmani Sultans, facing challenges under the rules of Muhammad Shah I and Mujahid Shah Bahmani.\n\nReports suggest that Bukka initiated a diplomatic mission to China during his reign. Following Bukka’s death around 1380, Harihara II assumed the throne.\n\nHarihara II (AD 1377-1404)\n\nBukka I’s son, Harihara II, became the ruler and was the first to adopt the legal titles of Raja Parmeshwara and Maharajadhiraja.\n\nImplementing a policy of expansion toward the Eastern sea coast, Harihara II led the Vijayanagara Empire into fresh conflicts.\n\nHe expanded his dominion by defeating the Reddis of Kondavidu in battles for control of Andhra, securing territories between Nellore and Kalinga.\n\nAfter capturing regions like Addanki and Srisailam, along with most lands South of the Krishna River, Harihara II had to confront the Velamas in defense of Rachakonda (Telangana).\n\nDevoted to the worship of God Shiva, Harihara II held a strong religious inclination towards Virupaksha.\n\nBahmani-Warangal Alliance Despite the alliance, Harihara II successfully maintained his position. His most significant achievement was the acquisition of Goa and Belgaum from the Bahmani kingdom in the West. Additionally, he organized an expedition to North Sri Lanka.\n\nDeva Raya I (AD 1406-1422)\n\nAfter the death of Harihara II, Deva Raya I ascended the throne, and his reign saw a shift in the balance of power in the Deccan. He constructed a dam across the Tungabhadra to bring canals into the city, addressing the water shortage issue.\n\nDeva Raya I, a secular ruler, included thousands of Muslims in his army.\n\nDeva Raya I actively supported Kannada literature and architecture, exemplified by the construction of the Hazara Rama Temple, showcasing Deccan architectural brilliance.\n\nThe renowned Jain poet Madura wrote “Dharmanathapurana,” a Kannada literary work focusing on the life of the 15th Jain Tirthankara. Deva Raya I modernized the Vijayanagara army by upgrading artillery, recruiting skilled archers from the Turkish clan, and enhancing the military capabilities of Arabian and Persian horses and bowmen.\n\nIn AD 1420, Italian merchant Nicolo de Conti visited the city, providing a vivid description. Deva Raya’s queen, Bhima Devi, studied under the Jain master Abhinava Charukirti Panditacharya and erected a shrine in Shravanabelagola’s Mangayi Basti in honor of Shantinatha, the 16th Jain Tirthankara, whom she revered.\n\nDeva Raya II (AD 1422-1446)\n\nConsidered the greatest ruler of the Sangama Dynasty, Deva Raya II employed a large number of Muslims in his service, granting them Jagirs.\n\nHe championed freedom of religion for Muslims, even placing a copy of the Quran in front of his throne.\n\nDuring the visit of Razzaq, the ambassador of the Persian monarch Shahrukh (son of Timur), to Vijayanagara, Abdur Deva Raya II earned the title of Gajabetegara, symbolizing his prowess as the Hunter of Elephants due to his victories against enemies.\n\nThe court of Deva Raya II included Sanskrit poet Gunda Dimdima and the mathematician Parameshvara.\n\nUnder his rule, an invasion by the Reddis of Kondavidu was successfully repulsed, bringing all petty regions under his authority by AD 1432.\n\nIn AD 1443, Deva Raya II crossed the Tungabhadra in an effort to recover areas south of the Krishna River, defeating Kalinga’s army and annexing Kondavidu, extending his authority up to Rajahmundry. Portuguese traveler Nuniz visited during this period and paid tribute to Deva Raya II.\n\nAround AD 1450, the Gajapati rulers of Orissa conducted attacks into Southern India, reaching as far as South Madurai, undermining Vijayanagara’s power. After Deva Raya II’s reign, internal struggles for the throne weakened the kingdom temporarily.\n\nDeva Raya II expanded his empire by conquering regional chieftains and the King of Quilon in Kerala. His capable commander, Lakkanna, invaded Ceylon, collecting large tributes.\n\nThe Zamorin of Calicut, as well as the kings of Burma ruling at Pegu and Tanasserim, paid tribute, demonstrating the fear and respect they had for Deva Raya II.\n\nThe Saluva Dynasty\n\nThe Saluva Dynasty was founded by Saluva Narasimha, the Governor of Chandragiri.\n\nSaluva Narasimha (AD 1485-1491)\n\nSaluva Narasimha (AD 1485-1491) ended the civil war, bringing peace to the Vijayanagara Empire.\n\nHe conquered the western part of Kannada, including Honnavan, Bakanur, and Bhatkal. Later rulers Timma and Imadi Narasimha were titular kings under the regency of Narasa Nayak.\n\nThe Tuluva Dynasty\n\nVira Narasimha, the founder of the Tuluva Dynasty, was a devout king who generously distributed gifts at sacred places, as noted by Nuniz. His brother, Krishnadevaraya, went on to become the greatest ruler of the Vijayanagara Empire.\n\nKrishnadevaraya AD 1509 to 1529\n\nKrishnadevaraya, reigning from AD 1509 to 1529, earned titles such as Andhra Bhoja, Andhra Pitamah, and Abhinav Bhoja.\n\nHis military prowess was remarkable, as observed by Portuguese traveler Domingo Paes during his reign. Krishnadevaraya was responsible for constructing renowned temples like Krishnaswamy, Hazara Ramaswamy, and Vittalaswamy.\n\nEngaging in wars against the Deccan Sultanates that emerged from the ruins of the Bahmani kingdom, Krishnadevaraya achieved decisive victories, notably in the Battle of Diwani AD 1509. His subsequent invasion of Raichur Doab led to a conflict with Ismail Adil Shah, the Sultan of Bijapur, whom Krishnadevaraya overcame around AD 1520, consolidating Bidar, Gulbarga, and Bijapur into Vijayanagara. This annexation of Raichur earned him the title “establisher of the Yavana empire,” as he released Sultan Mahmud, making him the de facto king.\n\nKrishnadevaraya’s successful Orissa campaign resulted in gaining control of Telangana by defeating Prataparudra, the Gajapati king. His cordial relations with the Portuguese led to the reception of ambassadors from King Albuquerque. Prime Minister Timmarusu, under Krishnadevaraya’s leadership, defeated Sultan Quli Qutb Shah of Golconda.\n\nThe Vijayanagara army, under Krishnadevaraya’s command, surrounded Udayagiri Fort in AD 1512, leading to the starvation of the Gajapati army for over a year. Following the campaign, Tirumala Devi and Chinnama Devi, Krishnadevaraya’s wives, offered prayers in Tirupati.\n\nIn AD 1518, a treaty was negotiated between Raya and Kalinga ruler Prataparudradeva.\n\nAs part of the agreement, the Krishna River was established as the border between the Vijayanagara and Gajapati Kingdoms, with Krishnadevaraya relinquishing all territories north of that river that the Vijayanagara Empire had previously controlled.\n\nKrishnadevaraya, recognized for his intelligence, was a staunch supporter of literature and the arts. Despite being a Vaishnavaite himself, he displayed respect for all faiths.\n\nIn Vijayanagara, he commissioned the construction of the renowned Krishnaswamy, Vittalaswamy, and Hazara Ramaswamy stone temples. Additionally, he initiated the construction of Rayagopurams, entrances to numerous significant South Indian temples, and undertook renovations of several existing temples. Krishnadevaraya also founded a new city named Nagalapuram near Vijayanagara.\n\nThe ruler was not only a patron of the arts but also a prolific writer. He composed Amukthamalyadha in Telugu Jambavati Kalyanam and Ushaparinayam in Sanskrit.\n\nKrishnadevarays Ashtadiggajas\n\nIn Krishna Deva Raya’s court, the Ashtadiggajas (eight celebrated poets) flourished:\n\nPeddana wrote Manucharitam and Harikathasaransamu.\n\nTimma authored Parijatapaharavam.\n\nMadaya composed Rajasekhara Charitam.\n\nDhurjate contributed Kalahasti Mahatyam.\n\nSurana penned Raghava Pandaviyam and Prabhavati Pradyuman.\n\nTenali Ramalingam created Panduranga Mahatyam.\n\nAyyalaraju Ramabhadra wrote Sakalamatasara Sangraharr.\n\nRama Raja Bhushan, the eighth digger, wrote Kavyalankora Sangrahamu.\n\nAchyuta Deva Raya (AD 1530-1542):\n\nAchyuta Deva Raya served as the ruler of the Vijayanagara Empire in South India.\n\nHe succeeded his elder brother, Krishnadevaraya, in AD 1529.\n\nFernao Nuniz, a Portuguese traveler and horse trader, spent three years in Vijayanagara during Achyuta Deva Raya’s reign, chronicling his experiences.\n\nAchyuta Deva Raya was a patron of scholars such as Chatu Vittalanatha Deva Raya (Kannada), Purandaradasa (Singer), and Sanskrit scholar Rajanatha Dindima II.\n\nSadasiva Raya (AD 1542-1570):\n\nSadasiva Raya ruled the Vijayanagara Empire in the 16th century.\n\nHe managed to escape the control of the ambitious regent Raju but later faced the usurpation of the throne by Minister Rama Raya, who became the de facto ruler.\n\nAravidu Dynasty:\n\nFounded by Tirumala, the Aravidu Dynasty’s last ruler was Venkatal.\n\nLater Rulers of the Dynasty\n\nDeva Raya II, succeeded by his eldest son Malikarjuna, successfully defended his capital against a joint attack by the Bahmani Sultan and the Raja of the Hindu Kingdom of Orissa.\n\nVirupaksha Raya II, a Sangama Dynasty king, succeeded his weak uncle Mallikarjuna Raya in 1465.\n\nDuring his reign, the Saluva chief Narasimha of Chandragiri rose to prominence, resisting the Bahmani kingdom and the King of Orissa.\n\nDecline of the Vijayanagara Empire:\n\nAfter Krishnadevaraya’s death, there was a period of confusion, marked by weak and incompetent rulers from the Aravidu Dynasty.\n\nTerritories of Vijayanagara were seized by the rulers of Bijapur and Golconda, contributing to the empire’s decline.\n\nConflict between the Vijayanagara Empire and Bahmani Kingdom:\n\nOne major point of contention between the Bahmani and Vijayanagara kingdoms was the control of the Raichur Doab, the fertile region situated between the Krishna and Tungabhadra rivers. This area boasted abundant natural resources.\n\nOther conflict zones included the Krishna-Godavari delta and the Marathwada area, both featuring sizable ports facilitating trade with neighboring countries. Notable among these were Goa’s port and the Konkan belt, which housed crucial trading hubs.\n\nThe Marathwada region, known for its fertility, operated a port crucial for both export and import activities, particularly the import of horses from Iran and Iraq.\n\nWhile territorial and commercial factors were primary causes of conflict, underlying Hindu-Muslim tensions may have also contributed to hostilities between the Bahmani and Vijayanagara states.\n\nVijayanagara Administration:\n\nThe Vijayanagara concept of kingship emphasized a form of absolute monarchy with a welfare state policy.\n\nThe succession to the throne followed a hereditary system.\n\nKrishnadevaraya, in his book on Polity, “Amuktamalyada,” advocated that the king, with great care and to the best of his ability, should focus on protecting the good and punishing the wicked.\n\nCentral Administration:\n\nThe Vijayanagara Empire had a Council of Ministers led by a Prime Minister, known as Mahapradhani, tasked with assisting and advising the king in administrative matters.\n\nOfficers of Council and their Departments\n\nProvincial and Local Government:\n\nThe empire’s administrative structure comprised various units, including Mandalams or Rajyas (Provinces), Nadus (Districts), Sthalas (Sub-districts), and ultimately Gramas (Villages). The number and size of Mandalams fluctuated over time. Each province was overseen by a Governor, known as Mandaleswara or Nayaka.\n\nRevenue Administration:\n\nThe primary source of revenue was the land revenue collected from crown lands. This revenue was determined based on crop cultivation and the quantity of yield obtained. Typically, 1/6th of the gross produce was levied as revenue, although at times, this rate could be increased to 50%.\n\nProstitution was subject to regulation and substantial taxation. Kaikkolas, a group of weavers and barbers, enjoyed tax exemptions. Private owners of workshops were required to pay a gratuity tax on their industries.\n\nSome Important Revenue Terms\n\nJudicial Administration:\n\nThe king ensured impartial administration of justice, presiding over the Sabha, the highest court of appeal.\n\nVillage courts, caste panchayats, and guild organizations were also in place to adjudicate minor offenses such as the violation of caste rules and trade regulations.\n\nCases were typically decided based on the principles outlined in Dharmasastras, serving as the foundation for the legal framework.\n\nThe Nayankara and Ayagar System\n\nIn the Nayankara system, military leaders were allocated parcels of land known as Amaram. These leaders, referred to as Nayaks of Palaiyagars, held revenue and administrative authority over their respective lands.\n\nTheir responsibilities included maintaining specified numbers of elephants, horses, and soldiers, which were to be provided to the king during times of war. Additionally, they were obligated to contribute a specific sum of money to the central ex-chequer. The Nayaks enjoyed autonomy in their regions and were not subject to transfer.\n\nThe Ayagar system played a crucial role in village administration. This system involved a group of twelve functionaries, called Ayagars, who oversaw all village affairs. These Ayagars were granted tax-free lands that they could enjoy in perpetuity.\n\nAn essential aspect of the Ayagar system was that these officials held hereditary positions, and no land in the village could be sold or purchased without their permission.\n\nMilitary Administration\n\nThe military was well-organized and efficient, featuring a standing army. Some Nadaprabhu (Incharge of Nadus), like the Gaudas of Bangalore, played a practical role in safeguarding borders from foreign invasions and quelling rebellious provincial Governors and vassals.\n\nRegular soldiers in the royal army received cash payments, while higher-ranking officers were rewarded with territories (Amaram) along with fixed revenue in lieu of salaries.\n\nVijayanagara Society\n\nAllasani Peddana, in his Manucharitam, outlines the four castes present in Vijayanagara society.\n\nViprulu or Brahmins adhered to traditional roles as teachers and priests.\n\nRajulu or Rachavaru were commonly associated with the ruling dynasty.\n\nMatikaratalu or Vaishyas engaged in trade and commerce as merchants.\n\nNalavajativaru or Shudras were primarily agriculturists, though some pursued various other professions.\n\nThe tradition of having dancing girls associated with temples was also prevalent.\n\nWomen’s Status\n\nWomen held an honorable position in Vijayanagara society.\n\nSome women were highly learned and achieved recognition as eminent laureates.\n\nAccording to the Portuguese writer Nuniz, women in the Vijayanagara Empire excelled in wrestling, astrology, accounting, and prophecy.\n\nGangadevi, the wife of Kampana (one of Bukka I’s sons), authored Madura-Vijayam.\n\nHannamma was a prominent scholar in the court of Prauda Deva.\n\nTirumalamma was a distinguished Sanskrit poetess during the reign of Achyuta Raya.\n\nEconomic Conditions\n\nThe economic landscape during the Vijayanagara Empire can be characterized as follows:\n\nAgriculture\n\nAgriculture thrived under the rulers’ policies, which aimed to promote farming across different regions of the empire. The implementation of a prudent irrigation policy was instrumental in boosting agricultural production.\n\nIndustries\n\nThe agricultural prosperity was complemented by a variety of industries, with textiles, mining, and metallurgy being the most significant. Perfumery also emerged as another noteworthy industry. Guilds played a crucial role in regulating and overseeing industries and crafts.\n\nTrade\n\nMalabar, particularly the prominent port of Cannanore on the West coast, stood out as the most significant commercial hub.\n\nKey exports included cloth, spices, rice, iron, saltpetre, and sugar, among others.\n\nNotable imports comprised horses, elephants, pearls, copper, coral, mercury, China silk, and velvet.\n\nCoinage\n\nVijayanagara emperors minted a substantial number of gold coins known as Varahas/Pagodas, named after the prevalent symbol of Varaha, the Boar incarnation of Vishnu.\n\nHarihara I and Bukka I featured the Hanuman symbol on their coins, while Krishnadevaraya’s coins depicted figures of Venkatesh and Balkrishna.\n\nAchyuta Raya utilized the Garuda symbol, and Tirumala adhered to the original Varaha on their respective coins.\n\nLiterature\n\nThe Bahmani Kingdom\n\nFounded in AD 1347 by Hasan Gangu, who served as the Governor of Deccan under the Tughlaqs, the Bahmani Kingdom established Gulbarga as its capital. Hasan Gangu assumed the title of Alauddin Hasan.\n\nThe Deccan region was initially part of the provincial administration of the Delhi Sultanate.\n\nMuhammad bin Tughlag appointed Amiran-i-Sada/Sada Amir, responsible for overseeing the administration of 100 villages, in an effort to establish a stable government in the Deccan.\n\nFrom AD 1337, conflicts between the commanders of the Deccan and Delhi Sultanates intensified. This eventually led to the foundation of an independent state in the Deccan in AD 1347, with Gulbarga in the Karnataka province as its capital.\n\nFamous Rulers of the Bahmani Kingdom\n\nBahman Shah (AD 1347-58), also known as Zafar Khan/Hasan Gangu, was the founder of the Bahmani kingdom.\n\nMuhammad Shah I (AD 1358-75) established a Council of Ministers with eight ministers known as Ashta Pradhana. This concept later influenced the Marathas.\n\nAladdin Mujahid Shah (AD 1375-1378), son of Muhammad Shah, was murdered by Masud Khan and Daud Khan.\n\nFiroz Shah (AD 1397-1422), hailed as the greatest king of his dynasty according to Ferishta.\n\nHe engaged in a conflict with the Vijayanagara emperor, Deva Raya II, resulting in the latter’s defeat. Additionally, he established the city of Firozabad on the banks of the river Bhima.\n\nPossessing skills as a calligrapher and poet (with the poetic names Uruji and Firozi), Hazrat Khwaja Syed Muhammad Gesu Daraz was a Sufi saint deeply connected with the Bahmani kings and the people of Gulbarga.\n\nGhiyath-ud-Din Shah (AD 14th June, 1397-15th November, 1397), also known as Ghiyas-ud-Din Tahmatan Shah and the son of Muhammad Shah II.\n\nMahmud Gawan’s military conquests included regions such as Konkan, Goa, and the Krishna-Godavari delta during Muhammad Shah III’s reign, expanding the Bahmani kingdom significantly.\n\nHe led a successful invasion against the combined armies of Orissa and Khandesh, introducing the use of gunpowder in the Battle of Belgaum against the Vijayanagara monarchs.\n\nMahmud Gawan seized control of fertile areas like Bidar, Daulatabad, and Berar, using alliances and victories to establish Bahmani rule over the entire Western shoreline from Dabhol to Goa.\n\nTo address rivalries among the nobles and strengthen the Sultan’s control over the provinces, Mahmud Gawan implemented internal administrative changes. He divided the kingdom into eight tarafs or provinces, each overseen by a tarafdar.\n\nHe founded the renowned Mahmud Gawan Madrasa in Bidar, a three-story institution measuring 242 feet long, 222 feet wide, and 56 feet tall, with a vast courtyard and arches on either side.\n\nMahmud Gawan, in addition to his administrative achievements, contributed to Persian-language poetry, with works like Riyaz-ul-Insha and Qanazir-ul-Insha. This period also saw the popularity of a new dialect, Dakhini du.\n\nAdministration of Bahmani Kingdom\n\nDecline of the Bahmani Kingdom\n\nPersistent warfare between the rulers of Bahmani and Vijayanagara fueled instability in the region.\n\nThe emergence of inefficient and weak successors post-Muhammad Shah III contributed to the fragmentation of the Bahmani Kingdom, paving the way for the rise of smaller entities within the Deccan Sultanate, such as Ahmadnagar, Golconda, and Bijapur.\n\nThe rivalry between Bahmani rulers and foreign nobles further weakened the empire.\n\nBattle of Talikota (AD 1565)\n\nOn 23rd January 1565, the allied armies of Bijapur, Ahmednagar, Golconda, and Bidar engaged in a decisive clash with the Vijayanagara ruler at Talikota.\n\nThe Vijayanagara Kingdom suffered a defeat near the villages of Rakshasi and Tangdi during the Battle of Talikota.\n\nSadasiva Raya, a puppet ruler, was in charge of the Vijayanagara kingdom at the time, with real power vested in his minister, Rama Raya. Rama Raya attempted to undermine the influence of the Deccan Sultanates by sowing discord among them. However, the alliance proved victorious, leading to the defeat of the Vijayanagara Empire.\n\nUpon entering the city, the victorious forces pillaged and destroyed the kingdom, laying waste to its treasures and infrastructure.\n\nIndependent Kingdoms of Deccan\n\nThe Deccan Sultanates, consisting of Golconda, Bijapur, Bidar, Ahmadnagar, and Berar, were five distinct Muslim kingdoms that held sway over South-Central India during the medieval period. Positioned on the Deccan Plateau between the Vindhya ranges and the Krishna River, these kingdoms eventually separated from the Bahmani Sultanates, evolving into independent entities.\n\nVarious kingdoms that emerged after the decline of the Bahmani kingdom are as follows:\n\nAhmadnagar\n\nThe Ahmadnagar Sultanate occupied the Northwestern part of the Deccan Plateau, sandwiched between the Sultanates of Gujarat and Bijapur.\n\nMalik Ahmed Shah Bahri founded the Ahmadnagar Sultanate on 28th May 1490, after defeating the Bahmani army led by Jahangir Khan, also known as the Nizam Shahi Dynasty.\n\nInitially established at Junnar, the Nizam Shahi Dynasty later laid the foundation for the new city of Ahmadnagar in AD 1494.\n\nIn 1574, Murtaza Shah annexed Berar, a move defended by Chand Bibi in AD 1596.\n\nDespite Ahmadnagar’s defeat after Chand Bibi’s death, other officials, led by Malik Amber, continued the resistance from the new capital, Paranda.\n\nFollowing Chand Bibi’s demise in AD 1599, the Mughal invasion was successfully repelled by the Ahmadnagar Sultanate.\n\nMurtaza Shah II ascended to the throne as Sultan in the year AD 1600, and subsequently, Khadki was designated as the new capital for the dynasty.\n\nIn AD 1636, Aurangzeb, the Mughal ruler of Deccan, ultimately overthrew the Ahmadnagar Sultanate.\n\nBijapur\n\nThe Bijapur Sultanate in South-West India was governed by the Adil Shahi Dynasty from AD 1490 to 1686. Fathullah Imad-ul-Mulk, the Governor of Berar at the collapse of the Bahmani Sultanate, asserted his independence in AD 1490 and founded the Imad Shahi Dynasty.\n\nAla-ud-din, his successor, resisted Ahmadnagar’s aggression with assistance from Bahadur Shah, the Sultan of Gujarat.\n\nDarya, the next ruler, attempted to align with Bijapur against Ahmadnagar’s aggression but was unsuccessful. In AD 1574, Tufal Khan overthrew Burhan Imad Shah, the last ruler of the Imad Shahi Dynasty, and Ahmadnagar Sultanate annexed it in the same year.\n\nFollowing the Battle of Talikota, Bijapur gained control of the Raichur Doab and subsequently captured Bidar in AD 1619.\n\nThe Marathas, under Shivaji’s leadership, successfully ousted the Bijapur Sultanate. In AD 1686, Aurangzeb ultimately seized control of the sultanate.\n\nIbrahim Adil Shah II\n\nRegarded as the greatest ruler of the Bijapur Sultanate, Ibrahim Adil Shah II authored a book called Kitab-i-Navras. Popularly known as Jagadguru Badshah, he extended patronage to all religions.\n\nBerar\n\nFathullah Imad-ul-Mulk, originally a Kannadiga Hindu, established the Berar Sultanate in AD 1490.

The capital was established in Achalpur (Ellichpur). However, Berar faced consistent attacks from Ahmadnagar, ultimately leading to its annexation in AD 1574.\n\nGolconda\n\nIn the early 16th century, Sultan Quli Qutb-ul-Mulk, originally from Persia, migrated to Delhi with a small group of family and friends.\n\nMoving to the Deccan in the South, he served under Muhammad Shah I of Bahman, establishing their capital initially at Golconda and later shifting to Hyderabad from AD 1591 onwards.\n\nFollowing the dissolution of the Bahmani Sultanate in AD 1518, Quli Qutb-ul-Mulk seized Golconda, becoming the ruler of Telangana.\n\nProclaiming independence, he assumed the name Qutb Shah, establishing the Qutb Shahi Dynasty.

Over time, the Barids gained power and effectively ruled the Bahmani Sultanate, with puppet sultans occupying the throne.\n\nIn AD 1542, Ali Barid Shan I succeeded Amir Barid as the first king of Bidar to assume the royal title of Shah.

In AD 1619, Ibrahim Adil Shah II of Bijapur overthrew him, integrating Bidar into the Bijapur Sultanate.\n\nThe Barid Shahi monarchs’ architectural endeavors primarily focused on garden tombs. The tomb of Ali Barid Shah (AD 1577) stands as a significant structure in Bidar.\n\nBuilt during Ali Barid Shah’s reign, the Rangin Mahal in Bidar is a meticulously adorned courtly structure. Other noteworthy monuments from that period include the tombs of Qasim II and Kali Masjid.\n\nBidri Work\n\nBidar holds the distinction of being the birthplace of Bidri, a significant form of metalwork.
