        "text": "Situated in the North Karnataka region, the district of Kalaburagi (formerly called as Gulbarga) forms part of the Deccan Plateau and shares its borders with Maharashtra and Telangana. Among the three districts of the former Hyderabad Karnataka area, it became part of Mysore (Karnataka) after the reorganization of States in 1956. Kalaburagi district is surrounded by Yadgir in the south, Vijayapura and Maharashtra in the west, Bidar in the north and Telangana State in the east.\n\nKalaburagi, one of the largest districts in Karnataka, is a land where the past blends with the present. It is noted for its long historical and cultural heritage spanning many centuries. This historically rich region of the Deccan has been part of a number of kingdoms. Ruled by dynasties such as the Shatavahanas, the Chalukyas of Badami, the Rashtrakutas, the Chalukyas of Kalyana, the Kalachuris, Bahman Shahis and the Adil Shahis of Bijapur respectively. Having a glorious cultural past, this region was also famous as a centre of Buddhism in Sannati. But Sannati came into further prominence by the chance discovery of Major Rock Edicts of Ashoka; which was the first such discovery in south India. A treasure-house of architectural delights, Kalaburagi is justly famous for the grandeur of the many Indo-Saracenic monuments that dot the landscape, making it a destination that takes one back through the pages of history.\n\nBeing a part of the Deccan Plateau, it has fertile black cotton soil and two major rivers Krishna and Bhima along with their tributaries like Kagina, Amaraja and Bennetore have provided suitable environ for human habitation from many centuries ago. The Upper Krishna Project is a major irrigation venture in the district. Major crops grown here include Bajra, Toor, Sugarcane, Groundnut, Sunflower, Sesame, Castor Bean, Black Gram, Jowar, Wheat, Cotton, Ragi, Bengal Gram and Linseed. Jolada Rotti, Tahari and Bele Hoorana Holige is the must-try delicacies here.\n\nFor further information, visit the official district website click here!\n\nHeritage Sites\n\nKalaburagi (Gulbarga) Fort: Said to have originally been built by Raja Gulchand of Warangal, Gulbarga Fort was later strengthened by Alauddin Hasan Bahman Shah, the ruler of the Bahmani dynasty. The fort, occupying an area of 20 acres with a circumference of 3km, has a double fortification with a 30ft moat between the walls, and reflects a blend of West Asian and European military architecture. The fort has 15 bastions with some 26 guns. One of the canons is about 25 ft long. Bahmani Sultans had the longest rule in Kalaburagi between 14th and 16th Over time Kalaburagi Fort has been under the rule of Rashtrakutas, Chalukyas, Kalachuris of Kalyani, Yadavas of Devagiri, Vijayanagara Empire, Hoysala Kingdom and Sultanate of Delhi. Bahmani Sultans had the longest rule over Kalaburagi.\n\nMalkheda Fort: Malkhed is a place of historical importance situated around 40 km south-east of Gulbarga, on the left bank of Kagina river, a tributary of the Bhima River. Earlier known as Manyakheta, it is also believed to be the capital of Rashtrakuta kings. Malkhed today has the remains of a fort with four entrances and 52 bastions. And in the village, there is an ancient Mallinatha Basadi, which consists of a garbhagriha, a navaranga and a hazara. Some 59 manuscripts in Prakrit, Sanskrit and Kannada languages have been found in this Basadi. Two temples namely lshwara Temple and Hanumanta temple are also located here. In the fort, a Jumma Masjid and few darghas are found here.\n\nChor Gumbaz: Located on a hill, the Chor Gumbaz is an attractive monument with a 30m high hemispherical dome, and corner towers with arches on each side, though it does not have the proportions of the famed Gol Gumbaz in Vijayapura. But like the Gol Gumbaz, this monument also echoes and at least seven echoes can be heard inside here.\n\nSannati and Kanaganahalli: Located 19 km north of Shahpur, this place can be reached easily by a boat from Shirival on the river bank. Locally called 'Sonthi', this village is a situated on the left bank of River Bhima. It is an important archaeological site as Sannati and Kanaganahalli has seen the discovery of Old Stone Age tools, Major Rock Edicts of Ashoka as well as Buddhist sculptures including a Mahastupa from the Satavahana period, Roman pendent and pottery. 4 inscriptions of Ashoka's time (3rd Century BC) and 77 inscriptions of the Satavahana period (2nd-4th Century AD), all in Prakrit language and Brahmi script, have so far been reported from Sannati. It is noteworthy that this is the only site where Brahmi inscriptions are found in such large numbers. And the oldest of the Brahmi inscriptions reported from here are the 4 fragmentary inscriptions of Ashoka's reign. Of these, two are Ashoka's Major Rock Edicts while the remaining two are Special Edicts. The discovery of these 2 Major Edicts assume significance as before this discovery, only Minor Edicts had been discovered in Karnataka. Thus, it becomes clear that in addition to being a place of Buddhist importance Sannati was an important commercial centre as it had contacts with Rome.\n\nBuddha Vihara: The Buddha Vihara is located 6 kms from the district headquarters near Gulbarga University and was inaugurated by the Hon. President of India in January 2009. Buddha Vihara is a modern-day monument spread over 18 acres.

The dome of Buddha Vihara is built on traditional Buddhist architecture and is 70 ft in height and 59 ft in diameter. The dome has an ornamental spire made of panchaloha with a kalasha on top, also made of panchaloha. Buddha Vihara is surrounded by four 48ft tall Ashoka pillars in the four corners in honour of Emperor Ashoka. The main attraction in the prayer hall complex is a gold coated 8.5 ft tall panchaloha statue of the seated Buddha which is believed to be the tallest Buddha statue in South India. Each block has a carving representing the architecture of Buddha temples of Ajanta, Ellora, Nagpur, Bodh Gaya, Saranath, Rajgir, Lumbini, Kusinara, Thailand, Singapur, Sri Lanka, Tibet, Japan and Rome. The floor of the hall has a seating capacity of 1500. The Dhyana Mandir (meditation hall) in the main complex has a 6.5 ft tall black granite Buddha statue. A perfect way to get relaxation and peace of mind is when you see the smiling face of Buddha which is accompanied by the chanting of the mantras. An open-air theatre with a 2,500-seat capacity, four large Mahadwaras (arches) known as Sanchi gates and a group of 11 cement statues led by a bronze statue of Dr B R Ambedkar are other highlights here. Buddha Vihara also houses a dormitory, a library, study centre, kitchen, dining hall, conference hall, exhibition hall and guest rooms.\n\nReligious Places\n\nSharana Basaveshwar Temple: A leading light of the Veerashaiva movement, Saint Sharana Basaveshwara was active in the Gulbarga region.

The sabhamandapa, which is constructed by using pilasters, independent pillars, and 36 arches, is very attractive and its pillars are decorated with peacock, garuda, naga, parrot, elephant, lion, flowers and creepers.

Its interior surface is decorated with flowers and creepers.\n\nChandrala Parameshwari Temple, Sannati: Although the historic discoveries of Buddhist and Roman importance have certainly added to the fame of Sannati/ Kanaganahalli but it is the Chandrala Parameshwari Temple that is the chief centre of attraction for the tourists. Located in Sannati along the River Bhima is the Chandrala Parameshwari Temple. Located on a mound likely having the remains of the Maurya period, this Temple is believed to be erected during the Rashtrakuta period and enlarged during the rule of the Chalukyas of Kalyana. The gopura, which is in Dravida style, is very attractive on account of the beautiful sculptures. This east-facing temple located within a large compound consists of a garbhagriha, an open antarala and a navaranga with a spacious sabhamandapa attached to it. In the garbhagriha is a bronze prabhavali carved with Sarpa, Mahakali, Lakshmi and Saraswati as also dhvaja, sankha and charka.

In the compound of the temple, slightly behind to the left is the renovated temple of Goddess Adishakti (Kalika). In fact, the damaged Ashokan inscriptions were on the pitha of Goddess Kalika and were discovered during renovation of this temple. The roof of this temple in this complex had collapsed and the disturbance revealed slabs with inscription in Brahmi script and Prakrit language. One of the slabs was used as a pedestal for the deity's idol. The inscription was later discovered as Ashoka's Major Rock Edicts belonging to around 3rd Century BC. Till date, these inscriptions are the only Major Rock Edicts discovered in Karnataka as before this discovery, only Minor Edicts had been discovered in Karnataka.
