But this marriage didn’t bring peace. Conflicts continued to break out in this doab region.\n\nThe alliance switch from Warangal to Vijayanagara brought a power shift in the Deccan region. This time Devaraya defeated Firuz Shah and hence he was forced to abdicate his throne for Ahamed Shah 1, his brother.\n\nAhmed Shah-1\n\nHe is also known as Wali which means saint due to his association with Sufi saint Gesu Daraz. This Sufi saint was from the Chisti order.\n\nHe ruled from 1422 to 1435.\n\nHe was considered an unkind ruler.\n\nAfter a series of defeats, Feroz Shah Bahmani was forced to abdicate his throne in favour of one of his brothers Ahmed Shah.\n\nThe series of battles for the control of the Doab region was continued by him.\n\nThe Russian travelling merchant Nikitin visited India during his reign.\n\nHe transferred the country’s capital from Gulbarga to Bidar.\n\nHe invaded Warangal and defeated and killed the leader.

And administration procedures are not any different. They adopted the administrative structure of the Delhi Sultanate with negligible alterations. The administration followed the feudal system. Small provinces in the kingdom were governed by governors. The sultan was the state head and had absolute power over all aspects of administration. This is because they believed in the divine right and considered the king as a representative of God on earth. So, his powers had no limits within his kingdom.\n\nIt was King Muhammad Shah 1 who divided his kingdom into four Tarafs namely, Gulbarga, Berar, Bidar and Daulatabad.\n\nEach of these Tarafs is ruled by a Tarafdar. They had power over the administration and army of that Taraf but were still under the control of the Sultan.\n\nSometimes a Tarafdar might be appointed as a minister in the central government under the Sultan.\n\nWhen Muhammad Gawan came into power, he allotted certain parts of the land of each Tarafs as the Sultan’s land to contain the power of Tarafdars.\n\nThe land was divided further for administrative convenience, Tarafs were divided into several Sarkars and Sarkars were divided into several Parganas.\n\nThe Parganas were ruled by Kotwals, Desais and Deshmukhs.\n\nThe basic unit of administration is the villages.

After his passing the kingdom became weak and consequently disintegrated into 5 smaller states. The reasons for the fall of the Bahmani Kingdom are stated below.\n\nIncompetent and weak successors after Muhammad Shah 3.\n\nThere were no correct laws laid by the Bahmani codes when it came to succession. This led to an internal tussle among all the claimants of the throne.\n\nLoss of money and other resources due to constant battles with Vijayanagara and other neighbouring Kingdoms. The conflict between Vijayanagara and Bahmani Kingdom was over the ownership of Tungabhadra doab region and the same is the reason for the fall of the Bahmani Sultanate.\n\nThe rivalry between the high-ranked nobles and Bahmani sultans increased. Provincial governors acquired significant power by this time and wanted to be independent from the sultan’s rule.\n\nThe infighting between the Afaquis and Deccani nobles led to a tough situation within the country.\n\nSome of the rulers followed extremely fanatical religious policies and were tyrannical to the Hindu population.\n\nIn the final stages, the sultans were mere puppets that danced to the tune of their Barid Shahi prime ministers who were more influential than the Sultans themselves.\n\nThe final nail in the coffin was the defeat of the last Bahmani sultan by King Krishnadevarayar of Vijayanagara.\n\nKalimulla was the last Bahmani Sultanate ruler.\n\nThe War and Peace with the Vijayanagara Empire\n\nThe Mudkal stronghold located in the Tungabhadra doab was stormed by Bukka Raya I of Vijayanagara in 1367. In retaliation, Mohammad Shah I, the Bahmani sultan of the time, crossed the river and entered Vijayanagara territory for the first time.\n\nThis was the first-ever recorded combat in India where artillery was utilized by both sides.\n\nThey accepted a treaty to return to the previous situation of sharing the Tungabhadra doab after a long-running dispute that had no results.\n\nIt was decided that both kingdoms would refrain from using violence in battle going forward because they would be neighbours for a very long time.\n\nCivilians who were defenceless and unarmed were not to be killed in future conflicts. This agreement lessened the brutality of combat in southern India.\n\nThe War and Peace with Warangal\n\nWarangal and the Bahmani sultanate also signed a treaty.\n\nThe line between Bahmani and Warangal territories was established at Golconda and did not extend beyond it.\n\nThis treaty, which lasted for fifty years, also prevented Vijayanagara from advancing.\n\nGet the best Bahmani Sultans – Study Notes for UPSC!

Later annexed and added to the Mughal Empire in 1637 by Shajahan.\n\nBera\n\nBera was founded by Imad Shah who belonged to the Imad Shahi dynasty. It was ten later annexed by Ahmednagar in 1574.\n\nGolconda\n\nGolconda was founded by Quili Qutab Shah of the Qutab Shahi dynasty in the year 1512.

Formerly the city was known as Bhagyanagara.\n\nBidar\n\nBidar was founded in 1526 by Ali Amir Barid of the Barid Shahi dynasty. It was later annexed by Bijapur in 1618-19.\n\nIn addition to these, the considerably weaker Khandesh Sultanate also had its autonomous existence for a while. Akbar finally incorporated it within the Mughal dominion.\n\nCurrent Affair on Bahmani Sultans\n\nYou may have seen the name of this dynasty in newspapers recently. It is because the Kalaburagi district officials were recently ordered by the Karnataka High Court to clear encroachments from the old Bahmani Sultan Fort located within the city.\n\nIn conclusion, we can say that the Bahmani Sultanate acted as a bridge between North and south India in various aspects. They ruled the Deccan region for around 200 years.
