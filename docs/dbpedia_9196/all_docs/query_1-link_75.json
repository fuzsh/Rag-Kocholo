        "text": "The Bahmani Sultanate was a medieval Muslim empire in the Deccan region of South India from the mid-fourteenth to the late-fifteenth century. It was established in 1347 by Ala-ud-din Bahman Shah, who had been a governor of the Delhi Sultanate but broke away and founded his own kingdom. The sultanate quickly grew in power and influence, eventually ruling over a vast territory. The Bahmani kings were known for their love of art and culture, and this is evident in the beautiful tombs that they commissioned for themselves and their families.\n\nThe Bahmani Tombs are a fascinating memorials located in the city of Bidar in Karnataka. These tombs are the resting place of the kings and queens of the Bahmani Sultanate. Walking through this medieval tomb complex, one is struck by the grandeur and beauty of the structures. The Bahmani Tombs are a unique blend of Indian and Persian architectural styles, with intricate carvings and elegant, soaring domes. They are a group of twelve mausoleums wherein each tomb is built in a unique style, reflecting the individual tastes and preferences of the rulers.\n\nThe most prominent of them is the tomb of Ahmad Shah Al Wali. Towering 30 meters high, this tomb is the largest and most grandiose of all the tombs and is a testament to the power and influence of Ahmad Shah. In 1430, Ahmad Shah moved the capital from Gulbarga to Bidar; however, he passed away in 1436. Alauddin, his son, created a magnificent mausoleum for his father. This mausoleum consists of walls that are about 12 feet thick, three doorways that are set into enormous recessed arches, and a large dome perched atop its cube-shaped structure. The swastika emblem, which was incorporated into this mausoleum for adornment, is the focal point of this monument. The tomb's inside is embellished with elaborate marble screens and murals, while the exterior is ornamented with fine carvings and calligraphy. It also has captivating tile-work.\n\nThe mausoleum ascribed to his wife Shah Jehan Begum is located east of the Ahmad Shah Tomb and was constructed at a lower level but with a similar style. There are five burials here, the largest of which is said to be that of his wife. The tomb is ornamented with murals on ceilings, floral patterns, and Quranic passages.\n\nThe mausoleum of Sultan Allauddin Shah is another well-known tomb in the complex. It has tiled panels and highly remarkable sculptures on the arched, black-stone edges. Allauddin, a smart and educated ruler, constructed his mausoleum while still alive. The elegant stucco work on the tomb's arches is its most striking feature.\n\nThe tomb of Muhammad Shah II, another prominent ruler of the Bahmani Sultanate, is also noteworthy, with a beautiful white-marble exterior and ornate carvings that cover every inch of the structure.\n\nAnother impressive tomb is that of Humayun Shah. It consists of arched edges that are decorated with carved black stones. The tile panels are blue, green, yellow, and white, embellished with calligraphy. The majority of its dome and two walls collapsed after being hit by lightning. The broken tomb is an interestingly odd sight. It appears to be a cross-section cut model of a tomb constructed specifically for architectural students. The mausoleum's interior has trabeate niches, lintels, and a dome made of light, pliable bricks, all of which seem to be interesting influences from Hindu temples and hint at the Hindu masons who likely built the structure.\n\nThe tomb of his wife, Malika-i-Jahan, is located southwest of Humayun's Tomb. Her tomb's entry arches are artistically stucco-worked. She was a crucial figure during the rule of her young sons Mohammed Shah and Nizam Shah. Malika-i-Jahan most likely constructed Nizam Shah's mausoleum. The tomb remained incomplete and is open with the dome missing. The thickly constructed walls imply that they were intended to support a massive dome. Muhammad Shah III was buried in a tomb located next to that of his brother Nizam Shah—his mausoleum is unfinished as well.\n\nMohammed Shah IV constructed his own mausoleum within this complex. It has beautiful arches in the walls. His sons Ahmad Vira Shah II and Alauddin Shah II, and their sons Wali-Ullah Shah and Kalim-Ullah Shah, were subservient to the Barid Shahis. These four tombs have conical domes and are located south-west of the Mohammad Shah IV Tomb. The mausoleum of Allauddin Shah II is covered with many tiles and is painted in hues of blue, green, and yellow. The centerpieces of this tomb are a square hall and three lofty entry arches.\n\nApart from individual tombs and the respective tales behind them, the sheer scale and grandeur of the complex are highly impressive. All the Bahamani tombs feature a unique construction technique—they are built using a combination of stone, brick, basalt limestone, and plaster and are decorated with intricate carvings, calligraphy, and stucco work. The domes of the tombs are constructed using a series of interlocking stones that allow them to be built without the need for a scaffolding.\n\nOne of the most striking features of the Bahamani Tombs is their unique octagonal shape, with each side measuring about 50 feet. The octagonal shape is a symbol of the eight paradises in Islam and is meant to represent the idea of the sultans being transported to paradise after their death. The tombs are also adorned with minarets, a common feature of Islamic architecture.\n\nEach tomb is unique in its design and features and is a reflection of the personality and character of the person buried within it. As an example, the tomb of Fathullah Imad-ul-Mulk features intricate carvings of animals and plants, indicating his love for nature.\n\nThe Bahmani Tombs serve as a potent reminder of India's rich cultural past and a tribute to the brilliance and inventiveness of the architects and craftsmen of the time. The inscriptions on the graves are in Arabic, Persian, and Urdu, illustrating the region's linguistic diversity.\n\nThe tombs are a well-known tourist site today, drawing travelers from all over the globe. The Archaeological Survey of India has repaired and protected the tombs, ensuring that they continue to provide a window into the past. These relics are indicative not only of the distinctly aesthetic architectural sensibilities of the Bahmani Sultanate but also of a lesser known period of the region’s history."
