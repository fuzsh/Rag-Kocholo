        "text": "Obverse:\n\nسلطان العہد و الزمان حامی ملت رسول الرحمن\n\nTransliteration: Sultan Al-Ehad wa Al-Zaman, Hami Millat Rasul Al-Rahman\n\nTranslation: Sultan of the age and time, supporter of the nation of the Prophet of Al-Rahman (transl. The Beneficient. Referring to Allah by one of his ninety nine beautiful names (Asma Al-Husna))\n\nReverse (Center Square):\n\nابوالمظفر محمد شاہ بن بہمن شاہ السلطان\n\nTranslation: Abu Al-Muzaffar Muhammad Shah bin Bahman Shah Al-Sultan\n\nTranslation: Father of the victorious, Muhammad Shah son of The Sultan Bahman Shah\n\nReverse Margins:\n\nضرب حضرت فتحباد\n\nTransliteration: (left) Dhuriba (top) Hadhrat (right) Fathabad , (bottom) 763\n\nTranslation: Struck (at the) capital city of Fathabad (in the year) 763 AH\n\nReferences: Goron and Goenka – BH28\n\nMuhammad-I Shah was the second Sultan of the Bahmani realm who succeeded his father: Ala Al-Din Bahman Shah founder of the Bahmani Sultanate (circa 748 AH / 1347 CE). At it peak, the Bahmani realms stretched from the Arabian Sea to the Bay of Bengal and from the Vindhyāchal range in the north to the Tungbhadra River in the south.\n\nWhereas, Gulbarga (modern day city of Kalaburagi in the Indian state of Karnataka) is associated as being the capital of the Bahmani Sultans, it was not until later in the reign of Ala Al-Din Bahman Shah that Bahmanid control was firmly established on Gulbarga. Prior to that, Gulbarga had risen in revolts multiple times, challenging the authority of the new Bahmani Sultan. As late as 752 AH (1351 CE), a local chieftain Pocha Reddy rose in rebellion siding with the Dehli Sultanate. The royal canopy during the early phase was raised at Daulatabad, which functioned as the de facto capital of the new Bahmani Sultanate.\n\nIssues with the mint name Fathabad are known only for the reigns of Bahman Shah and his successor Muhammad-I. The location of the mint of Fathabad is not known with absolute certainty. The Hyderabad Archaeological Report of 1929 identifies the location of Fathabad as the city of Dharur. However, it is also mentioned in contemporary historical sources that Daulatabad was renamed to Fathabad by Ala Al-Din Bahman Shah to commemorate the successful subjugation of the Tughlaq stronghold of Kalyani by the Bahmani forces under the command of the Bahmani general Qir Khan.\n\nBahmanid: Ahmad Shah – II, AR Tanka, Hadhrat Muhammadabad, 857 AH, 10.97 grams, 26.3 mm, Goron and Goenka BH83.\n\nObverse: Al_sultan al-Halim al-Karim al-Ra’uf Ala Ibad Allah al-Ghani al-Muahimani\n\nTranslation: The Sultan (who is) forbearing, generous, compassionate towards the slaves of Allah: the all-sufficient, the supreme protector.\n\nReverse (Center field): Abu al-Muzaffar Ala al-Duniya wa al-Deen Ahmad Shah bin Ahmad Shah Al-Wali al-Bahmani\n\nTranslation: Father of the victorious, noble of the world and the (political manifestation of the) religion (i.e., the Ummah) Ahmad Shah son of Ahmad Shah the Bahmani ‘wali’\n\nReverse Margins: (left) Dhuriba (top) b’ hadhrat (right) Muhammadabad , (bottom) 857 AH. (Trans: Struck at the capital city of Muhammadabad (in the year) 857 AH)\n\nShahab al-Din Ahmad Shah-I, the father and predecessor of Ahmad-II had moved the seat of the Bahmanids from Gulbarga to Bidar in the year 827 AH (1424 CE) renaming it to Muhammadabad. The move marked the beginning of the so called Bidar period of the Bahmani sultanate.\n\nThe obverse legend contains the five names from the ninety nine beautiful names (Asma’ al-husna) of Allah, namely: al-Halim (The forbearing), al-Karim (The generous), al-Ra’uf (The compassionate), al-Ghani (The self-sufficient, free of any need or want), al-Muhaiman (The protector). The long vowel appended to the last name in the legend clearly indicates that the last two adjectives are to be connected with Allah, while the first three are used to define the virtues of the Sultan.\n\nThe title of ‘wali’ warrants some explanation. When Deccan was under the Delhi administration during the reign of Muhammad bin Tughlaq, it was divided into provinces or iqlims. The southern provinces included provinces such as Deogiri (Daulatabad), Tilang, etc. Governors of iqlims were given the title of wali. If interpretreted from this perspective, it would seem that the legend on the coin proclaims the Bahmani Sultan as a governor (as translated in Goron and Goenka), implying that his authority is subjugated to some higher authority and not imparting complete autonomy to the Bahmani regent’s rule. However, this is clearly wrong, and the Bahmani sultans were completely autonomous starting from the reign of the first Bahmani sultan, Hassan Gangu aka Ala al-Din Hassan al-Bahmani.\n\nOn the other hand, father of Ahmad-II, Ahmad-I is reported to have been considered a saint by the local populace including both Hindus and Muslims, and was proclaimed as a ‘wali Allah’: a religious title that translates to ‘friend of Allah’, that is often given to prominent Sufis, such as the patron of Ahmad-I, Hazrat Khwaja Banda Nawaz Gaisu Daraz, who had prophesized his kingship. Therefore, viewed under this light, the title wali al-Bahmani inscribed on this coin, takes a religious undertone: the Bahmani Sultan is not only laying claim to political authority, but also giving his persona a pious and saintly outlook.\n\nA more plausible explanation for the title can be derived from the devotion that Ahmad-I had for the Sufi master Shah Naimat ullah Wali of Kirman. Ahmad-I had on multiple occasions tried to persuade the Sufi master to settle in Deccan. The Shaikh did not oblige himself, but sent his grandson in his stead. The mausoleum of Shah Naimat ullah Wali was also built by Ahmad-I and the family of Shah Naimat ullah Wali had marital relations with the Bahmanis. In this regards, both Ahmad-I and Ahmad-II took on the additional laqab (title, appellation) of al-Wali depicting their spiritual association with Shah Naimat ullah Wali.\n\nSultan Ahmad Shah – II, was the second Sultan of the Bahmani dynasty during the so-called Bidar period, and the tenth Bahmani Sultan overall. Ahmad Shah-II came to power after the death of his father Shahab al-Din Ahmad Shah -I in 1435 CE. His reign was marked by the continuing internal conflict between the original supporters of the Bahmanid cause: the Deccanis and the foreigners: the Afaqis. The sultan himself did not possess a strong military or political acumen and his reign saw continuous military conflicts with the neighboring Sultanates of Gujarat, Malwa, Khandesh and the Vijaynagara empire. Ahmad-II died due a wound to his shin sustained in battle, in the year 862 AH (1458 CE)."
