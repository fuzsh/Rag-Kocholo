        "text": "The Nintendo Switch has been out for a few months now and one of the most wanted things is the Virtual Console. Nintendo hasn't mentioned much about it at the moment, however, HAMSTER Corporation has been giving retro fans plenty to play with Arcade Archives.\n\nArcade Archives isn't something new and has been on many systems over the years, covering various retro games from Contra to Solomon's Key.\n\nFor the Switch, Arcade Archives is slightly different to what's on some other systems as there is no Contra for instance. What is on the Switch is Arcade Archives Neo Geo a selection of classic games from SNKs Neo Geo MVS/AES.\n\nI've owned a lot of consoles over the years including a Neo Geo CD where a lot of Neo Geo MVS/AES games where ported to as a cheaper option and a Neo Geo Pocket Colour which had its own unique library along with a few ports.\n\nDue to its small presence and arcade nature lot of the Neo Geo and high costs, a lot of games from the very start in 1990 right up to now (Breakers just been released on Dreamcast) have been coming to other systems almost right away, meaning you can find games on Mega Drive to Xbox and everything in betweens.\n\nEven though I owned a Neo Geo CD due to costs a lot of the Neo Geo games I've played have been on other systems be it Fatal Fury on Mega CD, King of Fighter 95 on Saturn or SNK vs. Capcom: SVC Chaos on Xbox.\n\nI personally think ACA Neo Geo has been one of the best things on the Switch giving people the opportunity to play Metal Slug, King of Fighters, Fatal Fury, Samurai Shodown etc.\n\nMost people even though they may not have played these classic series know about them. I'm in the position that I have, that even though I think having Neo Geo games on the Switch at a decent price is great, I'm yet to actually buy any as I can play King of Fighters 99 on my Dreamcast and not all the games I do want to go back to.\n\nWith this in mind, I did some research on the 148 game library of the Neo Geo MVS on what isn't the likes of King of Fighters and what titles have been brought over by HAMSTER, so far they've been from SNK, DATA East or Sunsoft.\n\nI went to the Neo Geo fans, looked up reviews to find the very best of the best of what should be the ten games we should be asking for Switch that isn't just King of Fighters 99 as we've had the rest.\n\nWe start the ten games of with Aggressors of Dark Kombat, a one-on-one fighting game from 1994."
