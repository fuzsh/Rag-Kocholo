        "text": "Hi to ya all, I'm new to the board.\n\nI have a pretty technical question to ask to confirmed Saturn developpers or (don't ban, wait and read ^^) emulator creators. In a nutshell, to anyone with a deep hardware basis.\n\nThe Sega Saturn has 2 (official) RAM cartirdges to increase it's RAM for games such as SNK or Capcom arcade convertions...\n\nBut there are also 2 games, \"The King Of Fighters'95\" and \"Ultraman Hikari No Kyojin Densetsu\" that use a specific ROM cartridge. Let's forget about the second game and focus on KoF'95.\n\nWhat I would like to know -the most accurately possible- is :\n\nWHAT is in the ROM cartridge of the game ?\n\nWhat is stocked in it ?\n\nAnd why did they pick a ROM cartridge instead of a simple RAM extension (like they did afterwoods for obvious financial reasons) ?\n\nA programmer I know (who has no experience of the Saturn) made the hypothesis that thereâs a DSP inside the ROM, like the Sega Virtua Processor in Virtua Racing for Megadrive/Genesis system.\n\nBut the Yamaha SCSP DSP which serves as an link between the 68EC000 sound processor and the Audio-RAM would have been able to play that role, wouldnât it ?\n\nI also found out on gameFAQs a guide from John Hokanson Jr mentioning this :\n\nâKing of Fighters '95 used a special 1 Megabyte ROM cartridge that\n\npredated the use of RAM cartridges. The ROM cartridge came packaged\n\nwith KOF '95, and was manufactured by SNK and Sega. It included all\n\nthe additional textures needed by the game in self-contained Â®ead\n\n(O)nly (M)emory chips.â\n\nI know that textures and backgrounds are dealed by the VDP2 chip. Is the cartridge related somehow to the VDP2, giving him special access to the ROM information ? Therefore the disc information would be sent to the VDP1 and the the cartâs info to the VDP2 ? But then how come the ROM cart is only 1MB ?\n\nIâm asking this after having searched for an answer for a whole week as this question emerged after a long forum discussion .\n\nWe canât find any answer, please help us, weâre dying (almost).\n\nThx\n\nCHAZumaru\n\nSaturn technical question on KoF'95's cartridge\n\n> WHAT is in the ROM cartridge of the game ?\n\nMy guess is as good as anyone's, but it's most likely graphics, read below\n\n> What is stocked in it ?\n\nExperience with damaged/wrong carts inserted in KOF'95 suggest that the ROM only contains graphics, most notably, the 2nd oppenent display. A good example seems to be the fact what with a 1MB ram cart, the 2nd player consists of gibberish.\n\n> And why did they pick a ROM cartridge instead of a simple RAM extension (like they did afterwoods for obvious financial reasons) ?\n\nIt speeds up the loading process. Also, it prevents piracy.\n\n> A programmer I know (who has no experience of the Saturn) made the hypothesis that thereâs a DSP inside the ROM, like the Sega Virtua Processor in Virtua Racing for Megadrive/Genesis system.\n\n> But the Yamaha SCSP DSP which serves as an link between the 68EC000 sound processor and the Audio-RAM would have been able to play that role, wouldnât it ?\n\nWhat's the need? KOF'95 is nice, but doesn't need extra CPU's...\n\n>I know that textures and backgrounds are dealed by the VDP2 chip.

But then how come the ROM cart is only 1MB ?\n\nWell, when he says \"textures\" he provably means sprites. The cart slot is a general purpose bus extensions, sort of like a ISA bus... If needed, or wanted,they can take precedence over parts of the memory... for example, booting their own BIOS like an AR does... This doesn't seem to be the case, but my memory tells me there is a bit of unused/reserved space just after the video memory that could be used by a cart... As for the size, most later releases still only used 1MB for extra data... 3Mb of WorkRAM + 512kb of VideoRAM (with fast DMA transfers) is quite a heap of memory for a 1995 console...\n\nSaturn technical question on KoF'95's cartridge\n\nOriginally posted by TakaIsSilly\n\nThe cart slot is a general purpose bus extensions, sort of like a ISA bus... If needed, or wanted,they can take precedence over parts of the memory... for example, booting their own BIOS like an AR does...\n\nI don't understand what this means. The cart slot usually doesn't take precedence over anything, at least I haven't seen it do so with an AR inserted. The IPL (BIOS) of a Saturn has to check whether there is a cartridge in the slot, then hand over control. There are lots of pins on a cart for Saturn, but I don't think the SNK programmers would ever use all of these. DMA transfers from cartridge ram to video ram are slower than from work ram, right?"
