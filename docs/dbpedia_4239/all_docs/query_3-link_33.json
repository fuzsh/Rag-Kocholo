And just like last year, it appears that the notorious criminal Rugal Bernstein is behind it, apparently returning from the dead to raise havok once again…\n\nThe King of Fighters ’95 introduces Kyo Kusanagi’s rival Iori Yagami, and firmly places Kyo as the main character for the rest of the series.\n\nThe gameplay of The King of Fighters ’95 is essentially unchanged from the previous title, though it does introduce the “team edit” concept which would remain as a standard feature of the series. Using the “team edit” feature, it is possible to create a totally customized team using any of the available fighters, or use one of the default teams if you wish."
