        "text": "Welcome to the Neo Geo CD Games Section. Most of these games are Japanese Imported Neo Geo CD Games, which means they may have some Japanese text included in the games or manuals. However, they will still play on a US or PAL Neo Geo CD Console. All games have been cleaned as described in the Care of Second Hand Games section.\n\nOf course, as in every other section we also have consoles and hardware available. Checkout our Neo Geo CD Hardware & Neo Geo CD Consoles pages for more details. If you are a collector of import games, please take a look at our other Japanese Video Game Imports.\n\nThe difference between Console Passion and other retro gaming shops is that all the games I sell are complete, and in either very good or mint condition. If you are not happy with the condition of a game you buy from me - send it back, and I'll give you a refund or replacement."
