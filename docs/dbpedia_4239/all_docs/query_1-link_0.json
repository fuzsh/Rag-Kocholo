        "text": "The Neo Geo is a video game platform developed and designed by SNK and supported from 1990 to 2004. It was released in three different iterations: a ROM cartridge-based arcade system board called the Multi Video System (MVS), a cartridge-based home video game console called the Advanced Entertainment System (AES), and a CD-ROM-based home console called the Neo Geo CD. Each system features similar hardware and runs the same library of games through different media formats. Most games were first released on the MVS then rereleased for the home consoles, however some never saw a home console release and eight games were released exclusively for the Neo Geo CD. This page lists every game released for all three Neo Geo formats.\n\nGames\n\n[edit]\n\nListed here are all 158[a] officially licensed Neo Geo games, including all 150 MVS games, all 118 AES games, and all 98 Neo Geo CD games. Not included are unlicensed games, prototypes, Neo Geo Pocket Color games, or Hyper Neo Geo 64 games.\n\nPlatform Description Media format Games released MVS Neo Geo Multi Video System ROM Cartridge 150 AES Neo Geo Advanced Entertainment System ROM Cartridge 118 CD Neo Geo CD CD-ROM 98\n\nTitle[1][2][3][4] Genre(s)[3][4] Developer(s) Publisher(s) Release date(s)[b] MVS AES CD 3 Count Bout Fighting, Wrestling SNK SNK March 25, 1993 April 23, 1993 April 21, 1995 ADK World Compilation ADK ADK Unreleased Unreleased November 10, 1995 Aero Fighters 2 Shoot 'em up Video System SNK July 18, 1994 August 26, 1994 September 29, 1994 Aero Fighters 3 Shoot 'em up Video System SNK, Video System October 12, 1995 November 17, 1995 December 8, 1995 Aggressors of Dark Kombat Fighting ADK SNK, ADK July 26, 1994 August 26, 1994 January 13, 1995 Alpha Mission II Shoot 'em up SNK SNK March 25, 1991 July 1, 1991 September 9, 1994 Andro Dunos Shoot 'em up Visco SNK, Visco June 15, 1992 July 17, 1992 Unreleased Art of Fighting Fighting SNK SNK September 24, 1992 December 11, 1992 September 9, 1994 Art of Fighting 2 Fighting SNK SNK February 3, 1994 March 11, 1994 September 9, 1994 Art of Fighting 3: The Path of the Warrior Fighting SNK SNK March 12, 1996 April 26, 1996 June 14, 1996 Bakatono-sama Mahjong Manyūki Board game Monolith Monolith December 13, 1991 December 20, 1991 Unreleased Bang Bang Busters Platform Visco Visco August 15, 2011 December 2010 June 2012 Bang Bead Sports Visco SNK, Visco 2000 Unreleased Unreleased Baseball Stars 2 Sports SNK SNK April 15, 1992 April 28, 1992 September 9, 1994 Baseball Stars Professional Sports SNK SNK April 26, 1990 July 1, 1991 April 21, 1995 Battle Flip Shot Sports Visco SNK, Visco December 8, 1998 Unreleased Unreleased Blazing Star Shoot 'em up Yumekobo SNK, Yumekobo January 19, 1998 February 26, 1998 Unreleased Blue's Journey Platform Alpha Denshi SNK, Alpha Denshi December 31, 1990 July 1, 1991 October 31, 1994 Bomberman: Panic Bomber Puzzle 8ing, Hudson Soft SNK January 18, 1995 Unreleased Unreleased Breakers Fighting Visco SNK, Visco December 17, 1996 March 21, 1997 April 25, 1997 Breakers Revenge Fighting Visco SNK, Visco July 3, 1998 Unreleased Unreleased Burning Fight Beat 'em up SNK SNK May 20, 1991 August 9, 1991 September 9, 1994 Captain Tomaday Shoot 'em up Visco SNK, Visco May 27, 1999 Unreleased Unreleased Chibi Maruko-chan: Maruko Deluxe Quiz Quiz game Be Top SNK, Takara November 27, 1995 January 26, 1996 Unreleased Crossed Swords Action RPG Alpha Denshi SNK, Alpha Denshi July 25, 1991 October 1, 1991 October 31, 1994 Crossed Swords II Action RPG ADK ADK Unreleased Unreleased May 2, 1995 Cyber-Lip Run and gun SNK SNK November 7, 1990 July 1, 1991 April 21, 1995 Double Dragon Fighting Technōs Japan SNK, Technōs Japan March 3, 1995 March 31, 1995 June 2, 1995 Eight Man Beat 'em up Pallas, SNK SNK June 7, 1991 November 20, 1991 Unreleased Far East of Eden: Kabuki Klash Fighting Racjin, Red Entertainment SNK, Hudson Soft June 20, 1995 July 28, 1995 November 24, 1995 Fatal Fury: King of Fighters Fighting SNK SNK November 25, 1991 December 20, 1991 September 9, 1994 Fatal Fury 2 Fighting SNK SNK December 10, 1992 March 5, 1993 September 9, 1994 Fatal Fury 3: Road to the Final Victory Fighting SNK SNK March 27, 1995 April 21, 1995 April 28, 1995 Fatal Fury Special Fighting SNK SNK September 16, 1993 December 22, 1993 September 9, 1994 Fight Fever Fighting Viccom, SNK SNK, Viccom June 28, 1994 Unreleased Unreleased Football Frenzy Sports SNK SNK January 31, 1992 February 21, 1992 September 9, 1994 Galaxy Fight: Universal Warriors Fighting Sunsoft SNK, Sunsoft January 24, 1995 February 25, 1995 April 21, 1995 Ganryu Hack and slash, Platform Visco SNK, Visco 1999 Unreleased Unreleased Garou: Mark of the Wolves Fighting SNK SNK November 26, 1999 February 25, 2000 Unreleased Ghost Pilots Shoot 'em up SNK SNK January 25, 1991 July 1, 1991 March 17, 1995 Goal!
