        "text": "The 90s golden era of 16-bit gaming was dominated by two home console juggernauts - the Sega Genesis and the Super Nintendo Entertainment System. The \"Console Wars\" at that time were at an all-time high as schoolyards across the nation were filled with schoolkids arguing over which system had the better games and the more likable mascot (were you more of a Sonic the Hedgehog or Mario guy or gall back then?). During that time, a lot of video game console makers threw themselves into the hardware race and one of them was SNK. The legendary Japanese publisher/developer produced classic arcade games via the Neo Geo MVS system that made their way into living rooms everywhere via the Neo Geo AES and Neo Geo CD home console platforms. The insanely high prices of the Neo Geo AES hardware and games meant only the biggest ballers in the neighborhood could afford them and put you and your friends on to its greatness. Thankfully, the most notable Neo Geo releases on the market are available via much cheaper and modern means. Allow us to show our appreciation for 30 of the absolute best Neo Geo Games.\n\nRELATED: The 26 Best Sega Saturn Games\n\nThere was once a time when SNK dedicated itself to other genres besides fighting games. And during that time period, it provided a quality action-packed platformer that wears its Ghouls 'n Ghosts and Castlevania inspirations on its sleeve. Magician Lord follows a powerful magician named Elta, who must put a stop to the evil machinations of sorcerer Gal Agiese. What's presented here is your traditional Gothic platformer where monsters must be kept at bay with your projectile attacks and flashy transformations that turn your magical warrior into a dragon, samurai, shinobi, and more.\n\nSNK's The King of Fighters series has existed as a tentpole IP that most gamers are familiar with. And for good reason - it's practically a celebration of SNK's varied vault of IPs. The King of Fighters '98: The Slugfest is one of the best installments in that series and plays out like a \"Dream Match\" scenario that features damn near everyone that's been in the KOF games up until this point. Along with all those fighters come \"EX\" versions of certain fighters, which allows for alternate movesets that pay homage to past versions of each character. With that good old KOF team-elimination gameplay and differing approaches to meter management (\"Advance\" and \"Extra\"), KOF '98 sticks out as a huge crowd favorite.\n\nJust like KOF '98, The King of Fighters 2002 moves into the Dream Match realm by forgoing an ongoing plot and just injecting everyone's favorite characters into the biggest battle royale the series has ever seen. The 4-on-4 \"Striker Match\" format from the last three KOF games gets pushed to the side here for the traditional 3-on-3 format, which works for the better. And when it comes to the roster, a bunch of series favorites make their welcome return - we love the fact that the likes of Omega Rugal and the \"Orochi Team\" / \"Awakened Orochi Team\" are in play here. Gameplay-wise, KOF 2002 refines the same amazing 2D combat the series has always maintained since 1994.\n\nThe King of Fighters 2003 truly pushed the series forward by adopting the mid-match character-switching mechanics of Capcom's \"Vs.\" crossover fighters. And thanks to that big change, the 3v3 matches of this fighter moves at a faster pace and feel way more chaotic (in a good way, though!). The \"Tactical Leader System\" and the ability to utilize a special attack known as the \"Leader Super Special Move\" threw in some cool changes to the KOF formula. And the likes of newbies such as Tizoc, Gato, and Malin added to a strong roster already full of beloved series regulars.\n\nWe love our vertical shoot 'em ups. And we definitely appreciate our horizontal shooters just as much. Pulstar goes the side-scrolling route in a game that embraces a simple premise arcade goers know all too well - take control of a spaceship armed with all sorts of weapons and use them to shoot down a hostile race of aliens. The action here unfolds at a quick yet manageable pace that's not too overwhelming, but you still have to dodge incoming bullets for a split second once the screen gets a bit crowded. Charging your attacks to pull off even more devastating attacks is one of the cooler aspects of this engaging space blaster.\n\nBlazing Star is the sequel to Pulstar that looks a bit better and plays just as well as its impressive predecessor. This time, you take on the role of one of six different ships that come with their own standard and special weapons. With a sizable array of characters and weapons styles to choose from, Blazing Star has that extra bit of replay value that gives repeat players more reasons to shoot down some rampaging starships across the galaxy. The weapon-charging mechanic remains intact here, plus the presence of stage hazards made careful maneuvering a more crucial element to pay close attention to.\n\nThe Golden Tee games are usually front and center in your local dive bar and random laundromat as the quintessential arcade golfer. SNK actually produced a golfing coin-op game of its own that was equally addictive as a home console sporting experience. Neo Turf Masters presents the sport of golf quite wonderfully with some crisp visuals and a roster full of international golfers equipped with signature skills and differing player builds. What we have here is one of the best arcade sports simulators and certainly one of the best Neo Geo games ever made.\n\nDuring the 1990s, SNK's Fatal Fury series rivaled that of Capcom's Street Fighter franchise when it came to outstanding 2D fighting games. One of the most noteworthy entries in the Fatal Fury line is Real Bout Fatal Fury 2: The Newcomers, which features the signature two-lane maneuvering system that always made the series stand out from its contemporaries. The debut of fresh roster entrants (Li Xiangfei is such a badass little martial artist and Rick Strowd is one of the coolest boxers in fighting game history!) are definitely part of the reason why we adore this Fatal Fury game so much.\n\nLike Street Fighter III: 3rd Strike, Garou: Mark of the Wolves marks a sharp turn for the Fatal Fury series. Thankfully, that major shakeup in presentation and gameplay mechanics ended up being a welcome evolution that fans grew quite accustomed to. Series frontman Terry Bogard received grand a new look and went to battle with a new gathering of charismatic brawlers that fit right into the ongoing Fatal Fury chronology. With the clever \"Just Defense\" and \"Tactical Offense Position\" (T.O.P.) systems put in place, Garou: Mark of the Wolves remains a high point for the series that offers tactical combat gameplay in the most rewarding way possible.\n\nThe first two Metal Slug games are dope in their own right. But it's Metal Slug 3 that is recognized by many as the greatest series installment. Blasting baddies with on-foot weaponry and armed vehicles remains an enriching activity here, especially in two-player co-op form. The addition of branching paths is what's so memorable about this game as it gives players a choice in how they'd like to tackle their incoming threats. Being able to collect different weapons and rescue even more POWs across different paths while on the way to a stage boss encounter is a simple joy Metal Slug 3 provides in full.\n\nTwinkle Star Sprites is such a unique take on the shoot 'em up genre. Not only are you blasting incoming baddies out of the sky, but you're also attempting to chain their deaths in order to send them to the rival player trying to do the same thing as you. This one may look all cute and warm, but the highly competitive vibes kick in hard here and force you to go way harder than you'd expect. This one-on-one shoot 'em up is pretty hype and definitely deserves some love here on this list of the best Neo Geo games.\n\nRunning and gunning in the arcades was a regular activity everyone indulged in during the good old days. And one of SNK's proudest contributions to that sub-genre of explosive shooters is Shock Troopers, a top-down take on a formula we know and love to this very day. Going the \"solo commando\" route in this game is cool and all, but we always get way more enjoyment out of the three-player \"Team Battle\" mode. It's easy to feel like Rambo as you run through hectic stages full of incoming soldiers, tanks, and a whole hell of a lot more.\n\nWe've already shouted out Pulstar and Blazing Star, so now it's time to bring up another one of the best Neo Geo spaceship shoot 'em ups. And of course, those in the know know that we're alluding to the great Last Resort. What makes this horizontal shooter so awesome and distinct is the use of a drone that can be maneuvered independently from your ship and provide more cover fire against the nonstop bullet hell assaults that come your way. Last Resort is pure class when it comes to the art of putting forth quality shoot 'em up action.\n\nThe Super Sidekicks series took the sport of soccer, gave it an arcade feel instead of a serious simulation one, and scored hella goals in the process. Super Sidekicks 3: The Next Glory is definitely our favorite as it improves upon everything fans saw in the previous two games. The addition of regional tournaments allows players to embrace their national pride and go for the top spot as their preferred soccer club lineup. With 64 teams to choose from, it's easy to get caught up in the on-field fun that erupts in this sprite-based soccer classic.\n\nThe Baseball Stars franchise is a banger, for sure. But on this list of the best Neo Geo Games, we chose to show our appreciation for another arcade baseball slugger. And that game just so happens to be the futuristic sports game with a year in its title that we've already been through (sadly...), 2020 Super Baseball. The basic baseball rules apply here, but it's the inclusion of cyber humans and robots that adds another element to the action that unfolds onscreen. Earning cash for playing well and spending it on abilities that make your players even better is one of the best parts of this baseball classic.\n\nWindjammers is Pong if it got injected with some late 80s/early 90s vibes and some superpowered special abilities that make all the action unfold at a faster pace. This disc-throwing game is way deeper than you'd think at first glance - the more you play it, the more you'll find yourself becoming better at pulling off the right offensive and defensive moves needed to emerge victorious. The game's charismatic players, super catchy music, and breakneck pace of the 1v1 disc-throwing are all top-tier elements worth celebrating.\n\nThe Bomberman formula is easy to wrap your head around - plant some bombs, get out of the field of its explosion, and try to catch your foes with all its sweeping splash damage. Neo Bomberman is one of the rare cases of that formula being brought over to Neo Geo arcade cabinets and never actually getting a console port. That fact leaves us heartbroken because we love it so much - the 2D visuals still shine, the battle mode will always be a blast, and the single-player stage missions allow for a little variety occasionally. Being able to ride a defeated enemy is the ultimate sign of disrespect in this game...AND WE LOVE IT!\n\nThe first Samurai Shodown came out of nowhere to join the 90s fighting game craze and offer something different in the form of weapons-based battles. Samurai Shodown II pushed the series forward toward more fan adoration thanks to many new combat options. Being able to roll forward/backward, duck, and parry an incoming blow to completely throw off an opponent's stance ended up being amazing add-ons to the first game's already solid gameplay structure. Plus this sequel marks the debut of the great Genjuro Kibagami - that reason alone is enough to christen Samurai Showdown II as one of the best Neo Geo games.\n\nAs we mentioned before, Samurai Shodown II marked a moment in the franchise where a lot more fighting game fans took notice and paid a bit more attention to SNK's fighting game output. Once Samurai Shodown V Special arrived, which is an updated version of the fifth mainline entry in the series, the weapons-based fighter got lifted to the upper echelon of fighting game greatness. What's on offer here is the most balanced version of an already great 2D fighter that's packed with more characters to master, new weapons to wield, and a wealth of satisfying gory finishers that adds even more weight to each battle. Samurai Shodown V Special is the peak of the 2D entries within the franchise.\n\nWaku Waku 7 is such a hilarious spoof of anime archetypes, such as the courageous male protagonist, cutesy bunny-eared heroine, and the brawny veteran who wouldn't look out of place on an episode of JoJo's Bizarre Adventure. And for some reason, it works! And that's mostly due in part to the solid fighting game mechanics implemented here and the gorgeous anime sprite graphics that still look as good as they've ever been. We need more parody fighters like this one.\n\nBub and Bob are those precious mini dinosaurs that are experienced in the art of popping bubbles. That art led to an extreme rise of copycat games that even dominate the playtime of your average mobile phone user. Back in the arcades, Puzzle Bobble 2 ended up becoming a lot of gamers' addiction thanks to that same entertaining gameplay loop that deals with setting up your bubble shots in order to clear out as many other bubbles in one turn. Being able to choose which set of levels you can tackle during your solo adventure and the two-player tournament-style mode are the two biggest additions to this quality sequel.\n\nFun fact - this 2v2 fighter was originally envisioned as a sequel to the Neo Geo fighting game version of Double Dragon released in 1995 (which was shockingly good). But after losing the rights to the beat 'em up IP, development studio Evoga had to switch gears and present this game as a homage to the world Billy and Jimmy Lee inhabit. And in the process, fighting game fans ended up with a super flashy team-based brawler that allows for seamless character swapping and some of the most hype-inducing tag team super moves we've ever seen. TEAM PEPE AND PUPA FOR THE WIN!\n\nThe Samurai Shodown series wasn't the only weapons fighter that was housed with SNK's Neo Geo arcade cabinets. The Last Blade games also dealt with fighting with an assortment of weapons during a specific time period inspired by the olden days. The excellent combat mechanics featured in the first game make their return here alongside three incredible characters that stick out as SNK's best fighting game characters - Hibiki Takane, Setsuna, and Kojiroh Sanada. The Last Blade 2 will always appeal to us for those reasons and get its proper billing among the best Neo Geo games.\n\nStreet Fighter II copycats certainly flooded the market back in the day. Most of them were pretty bad if we're being honest with you all (we're looking at you, World Heroes!). But some of them were a lot better than expected, such as the original Breakers. Breakers Revenge went ahead and refined the original game's character balancing, modified the overall appearance of characters' life meters, and altered some of the stage backgrounds to freshen things up. Alongside some solid gameplay came a new combatant by the name of Saizo (you can never go wrong with a ninja in a fighting game!) and a playable version of the super cheesy boss Bai-Hu.\n\nSavage Reign is a solid brawler that offers a more Mad Max take on the weapons-based fighting game formula. Its sequel Kizuna Encounter: Super Tag Battle offered a dramatic change by featuring 2V2 battles in a time when that type of fighting game mechanic was a rarity. By standing in a specific area on the battlefield, you'd be able to instantly swap out your current character for their partner to keep on fighting. The game's roster is awesome and we just can't get that earworm of a character select theme out of our heads. This game's boss King Leo always gives us hell, but we still have so much fun making our way up to him by taking down all comers beforehand.\n\nAs far as top-tier beat 'em ups go, Sengoku 3 is worthy of being crowned one of the best Neo Geo games ever released. In comparison to the last two games in the series, this threequel is miles better in the graphical department and feels a lot more impactful when it comes to smacking around all the baddies that try to test you. Six badass ninjas are available for play in a two-player co-op experience that's the best in its series. Killing undead hordes hailing from feudal Japan is a blast here.\n\nThe first King of the Monsters came through to appease to kaiju and wrestling fans with a fighting game centered around massive beasts. King of the Monsters 2 arrived later on to improve upon the first game's big city wrestling match formula and add in some beat 'em up action to add a bit more to the game's overall package. Joining up with a fellow monster to wreak some havoc across the globe and take down even bigger monsters make this game's battles an utter joy.\n\nThe Neo Geo games library certainly has an abundance of great horizontal and vertical shoot 'em ups to enjoy. Speaking of vertical, one of our faves from that airship shooter sub-genre is Aero Fighters 2. The second entry in the three-game series will always be the best for us since it just plays and looks the best. Taking to the skies as Team Japan and proceeding to blast through rival airships above an amusement park is a warm memory we'll always be thankful for from this game (who also loved blowing up the Ferris wheel every time?)."
