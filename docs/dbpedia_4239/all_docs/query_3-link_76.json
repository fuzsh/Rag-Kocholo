        "text": "The King of Fighters '95 is a Fighting game published by SNK Playmore, Hamster Corporation, D4 Enterprise released in 2007.\n\nSince The King of Fighters '95 is a fighting style of game you can expect fast paced, side view, player vs. player fighting action. Like Moral Kombat, Tekken, or Dead or Alive, most fighting games are in an arena with 3d style graphics and really rely on the players reflexes.\n\nHow to Port Forward The King of Fighters '95\n\nWhen you are playing The King of Fighters '95 you might need to forward some ports in your router. Forwarding ports is a useful trick in gaming because it can really help to make your network connection most stable and frequently even faster. Routers were not designed to allow incoming network requests and some games can play tremendously better if an incoming connection is forwarded through the router to the game.\n\nUse a VPN Instead\n\nHave you considered using a VPN instead of forwarding a port? For most users, a VPN is a much simpler and more secure choice than forwarding a port.\n\nWe use and recommend NordVPN because not only is it the fastest VPN, it includes a new feature called Meshnet that makes forwarding a port no longer necessary for most applications. With NordVPN Meshnet, you can connect to your devices from anywhere in the world, completely secure, over a highly encrypted VPN tunnel.\n\nWhen shopping for a VPN, make sure that they meet the following criteria:\n\nYour VPN provider should have a no-logs policy. This means that they do not keep any logs of any kind.\n\nMake sure that your VPN provider has lots of exit nodes all around the world.\n\nCheck that your VPN will not affect your speed.\n\nVerify that your VPN provider uses WireGuard as the underlying protocol.\n\nMany people prefer a VPN provider that is not based in the United States.\n\nThis is the list of requirements that we used when we were shopping around for a VPN provider. There are lots of free, shady VPN providers out there that we looked at and dismissed.\n\nBased in Panama, using diskless servers, and with over 6,100 servers in 61 countries, we can safely say that NordVPN satisfies all of these requirements.\n\nOnce you've set up your NordVPN account on multiple computers and enabled Meshnet, you can seamlessly access all of your devices as if they were on the same network. You don't even have to log in to your router. It's very simple.\n\nEvery time you click on one of our affiliate links, such as NordVPN, we get a little kickback for introducing you to the service. Think of us as your VPN wingman.\n\nBefore You Forward a Port\n\nBefore you can forward a port you need to know the following things:\n\nThe IP address of your network router.\n\nYour gaming machine's IP address.\n\nA list of TCP and UDP ports that need to be forwarded.\n\nHow to find your router's IP Address\n\nThe easiest way to find your router's IP address is to run our free Router Detector utility. It's a part of the Network Utilities suite of tools and it's completely free to use.\n\nHow To Forward Ports\n\nTo easily and quickly get your ports forwarded use the Network Utilities software. Network Utilities allows you to forward ports only when you need them, and then close them again when you are done. This makes keeping your network more secure much easier. You can also do it by hand.\n\nThe process for forwarding a port is usually:\n\nStart by logging in to your router.\n\nFind your routers port forwarding section.\n\nPut the IP address of your computer or gaming console in the correct box in your router.\n\nPut the TCP and UDP ports for your game in the matching boxes in your router.\n\nOn occasion you have to reboot your router for the changes to take effect.\n\nDon't forget to sign up for NordVPN's promo deal before it's gone.\n\nPorts Required for The King of Fighters '95\n\nThe specific ports for The King of Fighters '95 are as follows:\n\nThe King of Fighters '95 - Playstation 3\n\nTCP: 3478-3480, 5223, 8080\n\nUDP: 3074, 3478-3479, 3658\n\nThe King of Fighters '95 - Playstation 4\n\nTCP: 1935, 3478-3480\n\nUDP: 3074, 3478-3479\n\nThe King of Fighters '95 - Switch\n\nTCP: 6667, 12400, 28910, 29900, 29901, 29920\n\nUDP: 1024-65535\n\nThe King of Fighters '95 - Wii\n\nTCP: 6667, 12400, 28910, 29900, 29901, 29920\n\nUDP: 1024-65535\n\nThe King of Fighters '95 - Xbox One\n\nTCP: 3074\n\nUDP: 88, 500, 3074, 3544, 4500\n\nWe have guides that are custom tailored for The King of Fighters '95 that will show you the ports that need to be forwarded.\n\nThe King of Fighters '95 - Playstation 3\n\nThe King of Fighters '95 - Playstation 4\n\nThe King of Fighters '95 - Switch\n\nThe King of Fighters '95 - Wii\n\nThe King of Fighters '95 - Xbox One"
