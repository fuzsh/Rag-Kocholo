        "text": "Neo-Geo CD Price Guide and English Version Rarity\n\nThe Neo-Geo CD has always been pitched as the more affordable route to collect true SNK games at the full quality of its big brothers the AES and MVS. Of course the original CD load times (which are much improved in projects like the Polymega) have been the main downside.\n\nThe Neo-Geo CD library has never been cheap compared to many other mainstream consoles, but some games are quite affordable (and those that get a little pricey are still much cheaper than their cartridge brethren).\n\nWhile some Japanese releases can be quite tricky to find, they is another step to go for treasure hunters out there.Â Typically reserved for only the most adventurous or meticulous Neo Geo CD collectors, there are English variations of most of the Neo Geo CD titles. Not surprisingly, the English versions are significantly harder to find and, as a result, demand and hefty premium — especially certain titles. The Neo-Geo CD games weren’t really carried in mainstream stores in the states and primarily relied on mail-order for North American distribution with a few specialty stores that carried them.\n\nIt should be worth noting that some of the English versions only have English manuals, spines and back liner. For some of the earlier titles especially, the actual game disc, and sometimes even the back liner, is the same as the Japanese releases. Some have mentioned that it was once possible to purchase English manuals direct from SNK USA. In all cases, the spine cards can be especially tricky to track down. Even some dedicated Neo Geo CD collectors have never seen English spine cards for certain games in the library.\n\nMany in the Neo Geo community strongly advise against collecting only English releases as they can be very hard to find and most hardly ever come up for sale. If you’re interested in Neo-Geo CD, focus on Japanese version and, if you happen to find an English one in your budget, pick some up at your leisure.\n\nCheck for English Neo-Geo CD Games on eBay\n\nPricing Notes:\n\nJapanese releases, even the rarer ones, typically show up on eBay somewhat regularly. Â One the past few months, we have seen completed eBay sales of most every title in different conditions, so the guide below shows a range for each Japanese release.\n\nSince English releases are much harder to find, we don’t have values listed for each. All that are shown are based on completed sales in the last few months. Â Combined with the rarity rankings and comparing to those that do have prices, you should be able to generate ballpark estimates for ones without English values listed. We will continued to update this periodically to capture more confirmed sales. Â It is worth noting that you may likely see many of the English releases for sale on eBay, but they are often listed at more ambitious pricing which is why we don’t include those values here.\n\nRarity Notes:\n\nI have combed through many resources in the Neo-Geo community such as Neo-Geo.com, NeoGeoKult, and some other forum discussions to see how different past guides ranked rarities (and I balanced the differences manually), and prioritized some of the games (especially English releases) the the most experienced collectors have commented on seeing the least in addition to those that do not seem to have been confirmed to have an English release. Â A special thanks to “sharp” who used the comments for this post to help refine these listings and provided some extra information.\n\nTable Column Key:\n\nJP Rare = Japanese Release Rarity Score 1 = lowest, 10 = highest\n\nEN Rare = English Release Rarity Score 1 = lowest, 10 = highest\n\nEN? = If there has been a confirmed English release of the game\n\nJP Low$ = Lower end of the value range for Japanese Release — mostly with case and manual, but without spine card\n\nJP Mint$ = High end of the value range for Japanese Release — would include spine card, but not sealed (sealed usually has a modest premium)\n\nEN Low$ = Lower end of the value range for English Release — mostly with case and manual, but without spine card\n\nEN Mint$ = High end of the value range for English Release — would include spine card, but not sealed (sealed usually has a modest premium)\n\nSortable Price / Rarity Guide\n\nEnglish / Japan\n\nTitle JP\n\nRare EN\n\nRare EN?
