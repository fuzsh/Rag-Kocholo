But ill try with others Isos.\n\nYes i followed the steps, but when i have to save as… the option is not available.\n\nFBNeo is not compatible with TAO isos (redump), you need to convert it to DAO. The “save as” doesn’t appear because you didn’t follow the steps : Get CDMage 1.02.1.\n\nThanks, finally its running, as weird as this sounds, just had convert the redump iso to .chd file and then back to .cue, .bin files, all .bin tracks were mixed into one .bin file, and thats it, now it works selecting the .cue file, thanks to everyone who helped me. @BarbuDreadMon, @DaveTheMan1985 .\n\nMy Pleasure @Kscorpionx\n\nGlad you got it Going"
