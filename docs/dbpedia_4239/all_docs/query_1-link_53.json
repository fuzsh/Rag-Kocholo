If so, that’s wack as hell… Unless it has a lock switch too\n\nSaw this on Twitter yesterday.\n\nLooks… cute?\n\nIt’s not often you see rounded arcade stick designs like this.\n\nI can’t really see it being priced at a number that would get me to buy one, but it’s differently cute enough that I might consider grabbing one if the price is right.\n\nI’m going to assume that it’s the Start/Select buttons.\n\nI don’t think I’d have a problem with accidentally hitting those buttons, but that varies from play-style/grip-style per player…\n\nYeah, I don’t think I’d have too many issues, but why risk it? It just seems like a silly place to put that. It’s in the middle of all the action\n\nAny worries about hitting those during play should be trumped by a desire to work on better execution.\n\nUh I guess…? But if this thing comes pre-loaded with a bunch of games and one of my nephews wants to play, having a start button where he’s going smack it just seems dumb. They seem really low profile, and like I said before I bet they have a lock switch, but it just doesn’t seem intelligently designed\n\nThat so called “pro” stick’s outline looks a hell of a lot like Qanba’s Q6 camo fightstick (the Q6 itself looked like an overblown sega saturn joypad …)\n\nI’m not a fan of that design. It looks really bland & boring and, doesn’t get me pumped for some NeoGeo action.\n\nAs for the built-in games? Sorry. The Pandora Box line did it first and BETTER. I myself own a kickass, custom Pandora Box 6, all Sanwa parts, 1300+ games, excellent emulation, sexy SEGA Astro City cabinet artwork, Bubbletops, etc.\n\nAlso the irony of an Arcade stick that looks like a gamepad…\n\nMore info\n\nhttps://twitter.com/SNKPofficial/status/1171241092743696390\n\nSo those two things we thought were the Start and Select buttons are actually LED lights that indicate which mode it’s in.\n\nAt least, it can be used on PC. I expect this to have the same low quality display output as those Neo Geo Mini consoles.\n\nStill it is leagues better than Capcom’s Arcade Stick\n\nSNK revealed the list of 20 pre-installed games for its Neo Geo Arcade Stick Pro\n\nThe King of Fighters '95\n\nThe King of Fighters '97\n\nThe King of Fighters '98\n\nThe King of Fighters '99\n\nThe King of Fighters 2000\n\nThe King of Fighters 2002\n\nFatal Fury Special\n\nFatal Fury 3\n\nGarou: Mark of the Wolves\n\nSamurai Shodown II\n\nSamurai Shodown III\n\nSamurai Shodown IV\n\nSamurai Shodown V Special\n\nArt of Fighting\n\nWorld Heroes 2\n\nWorld Heroes 2 Jet\n\nWorld Heroes Perfect\n\nNinja Masters\n\nThe Last Blade 2\n\nKizuna Encounter\n\nSo pretty much the enrity of the Who’s Who’s of Neo Geo Fighting games.\n\nWow! Nice lineup.\n\nI would`ve picked one of the Real Bout games over FF3\n\nAnd AOF2 over the 1st one, but yeah it’s a pretty good list.\n\nMy Pandora Box has all those games and a ton more, complete with Full Sanwa controls, and badass artwork.\n\nAlso it doesn’t look like a giant gamepad! This thing looks soooooo Bland! Why didn’t they just design it to invoke the looks of the Classic NeoGeo AES sticks, or the “Big Red” Arcade cabinet control panel?! Either of those would have been Great! Instead of this doofy white shape. WTF. Missed opportunities.\n\nIt just begs for a second, “Limited Edition” release, that looks like it should!\n\nSNK says the “arcade stick pro” design was inspired by the Neogeo CD gamepad (whose shape they reused for the mini) :\n\n「NEOGEO Arcade Stick PRO」は、白を基調としたシンプルで美しい筐体デザイン。本体の形状は、ファンには懐かしいNEOGEO CDのコントローラがインスパイアされています。その独特の丸いフォルムは手に馴染みやすく、コントローラーとの一体感を感じることができます。\n\nthe only thing “pro” is in the name. Wait until you see the horrid balltop cover options that are offered…\n\nI damn near pissed myself laughing so hard at those balltop condoms\n\nTROJAN MAN !!! ♫ ♫\n\nOfficial Page.\n\nPre order on Amazon for $130.\n\nAt $130, I’m guessing it’s using SNK made parts and not Sanwa or Seimitsu. Not a huge issue if you can easily change the parts."
