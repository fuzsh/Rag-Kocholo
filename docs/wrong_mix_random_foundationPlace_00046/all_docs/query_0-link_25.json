        "text": "CHAPTER I\n\nHISTORY OF IMPERIAL COUNTY\n\nThe name California seems to have been derived from a Spanish romance published in 1510. The author there speaks of the \"Great Island of California, where a great abundance of gold and precious stones are found.\" This story attained considerable popularity about the time when the Cortez exploring expedition reached that undiscovered country. It is thought that some of the officers of that party who had read this romance were especially pleased with this name. It was euphonious and descriptive, as they had expected to find an Eldorado in that new region any way, because the early Spanish discoverers had so promised.\n\nBut at that time this name was applied only to the lower Pacific coast and the adjacent territory. And it is interesting to note here that this San Diego section was on the border line of Mexico, being then a part of that nation. It was not until some years later that the name California was applied to the upper part of that country, and it gradually extended northward, with no very definite limits. These Spanish Americans divided the whole territory into upper and lower California, as it has since been known. The lower coast was first discovered in 1534 by an expedition sent out by Cortez, who later found the Gulf of California. It was not until some six years later that the mouth of the Colorado River was discovered there. And it was not until 1602 that the Bay of San Diego was located.\n\nAs a matter of fact the physical geography of a very large portion of this great country was very imperfectly known. Few of the residents were even qualified to make any scientific study of its topography and very little attention was given to the subject, especially that portion lying on the immediate coast between San Diego on the south and Fort Ross on the north, a narrow strip of land forty or fifty miles in width. In fact the entire California region was a very indefinite quantity for many years, and the eastern boundary was not fully located or determined. And this condition remained until 1850 when it passed into the ownership of the United States and became one of the states of the Union.\n\nBut this work is devoted to the southernmost point of the state known as Imperial County, which is the youngest and newest county of the great Pacific Commonwealth, having been formed in 1907 from the eastern portion of San Diego County.\n\nThis Imperial Valley lies between the coast range of mountains and the Colorado River, a section long known as the Colorado Desert, and for ages considered worthless and irreclaimable. North of this great desert is the eastern extension of the San Bernardino mountain range, dry, barren and worthless. On the west the Coast range rises to a height of from 3,000 to 5,000 feet, which, on the desert side, is also dry and barren. Through the eastern part of this desert is a range of sand-dunes which extends down across the international boundary line, terminating just below. Between these sand-dunes on the east and the Coast range on the west, there is a vast, level plain which, before its reclamation, was as dry and barren as the hills and sand-dunes themselves. Most of this plain is below sea level, and was originally an extension of the California Gulf.\n\nSome sixty miles south of this Mexican boundary line the great Colorado River tumbles finally into the gulf. It is a very muddy stream which has poured into this gulf for untold ages. When the gulf reached the present site of Indio Station, the river poured into it about 150 miles southeast of that place. This gulf was then some 50 miles wide opposite the ancient mouth of the river. Gradually the Colorado formed a bar across the gulf. After a time this bar was raised several feet above high-water mark, and this cut off the upper portion of the gulf from the main body of water and formed an inland sea some 40 miles in width by 125 miles in length. It will be seen, therefore, that the flow of this river for ages has been in both directions, into the gulf and into this inland sea. In this way large masses of sediment were deposited in both places not only, but a separating bar was raised 35 to 80 feet above sea level, an increase of about 60 miles in width from south to north.\n\nSometime after this the Colorado began to pour its regular flow into the gulf, and only in times of flood, during June and July, was the surplus water sent into the inland sea. Then finally, when the permanent flow northward ceased, this inland sea gradually dried up, leaving what is known as the \"Salton Basin,\" a tract 100 miles long and from 20 to 50 miles wide. And this vast area was all below the level of the sea. The bottom was a salt marsh 5 x 25 miles in extent, and 265 feet below the sea, while the surrounding land sloped gradually toward this depression.\n\nHere in this sink the Salton Sea was formed in 1891 as a result of the long continued flood of the Colorado stream. It began with heavy rains in February and was afterward augmented by the regular annual flood in June and July, because of the melting snows at the headwaters of the stream in Utah, Wyoming and Colorado. About 150 square miles of this Salton Sea was so level that the water did not exceed 10 feet in depth at any point. All around this sea were a million acres of land below sea level, half of which is arable, irrigable, and especially fertile. In addition to this, there is a vast expanse of country south of the international boundary line which extends to the Gulf of California on the east. Most of this is the most fertile and productive land in the world, and it covers about 800,000 acres. Of this vast tract, 300,000 acres are irrigable. A similar acreage is subject to the annual flood overflow and some 100,000 acres are of little value from other causes.\n\nIRRIGATION\n\nHere was a golden opportunity to test the value of irrigation on a colossal scale. It was destined to reclaim millions of acres of the most fertile land on the globe, from this vast California section which had been given up as a worthless desert since its first discovery. It took men of courage and indomitable persistence with a full knowledge of all the conditions and obstacles that might present themselves, even to begin this stupendous work. And yet with such a prize, with such glowing possibilities as the reward, history shows that the men for the task usually have been found.\n\nThus it was that in 1856 Dr. Oliver M. Wozencraft of San Bernardino came to the front and applied to Congress for a land grant for himself and his associates if they would reclaim the lands. The application was received with favor, and the Committee on Public Lands reported in favor of the concession.\n\nBut soon after this the Civil war broke out and threatened to disrupt the Union. There was no time to think of any new projects of this fortuitous nature. The plan was abandoned, and Dr. Wozencraft died at his home with the pet scheme of his life in abeyance. Then for over thirty years this great project of such transcendent importance to the nation, and especially this California section, lay dormant.\n\nThis was partly due to the reconstruction period of the national life perhaps, but also because of the fact that no successor to Dr. Wozencraft had been found. But the project was too great to die, and it came to the front again in 1891 with some show of success. Mr. C. R. Rockwood was given charge of all the engineering problems, and he worked successfully for a time. But now the financial and business end of the enterprise was wrecked in the panic of 1893, and that organization was abandoned. But Mr. Rockwood still had faith in the scheme and did not propose to give it up. Thus in 1896, allying himself with a new element, the California Development Company was duly incorporated with a capital stock of $1,250,000. Among these incorporators were the late A. H. Heber, an experienced colonizer, who was chosen president; C. R. Rockwood, chief engineer; Dr. W. T. Heffernan, and W. H. Blaisdell, both of Yuma. These men had an abiding faith in the enterprise and gave material assistance in the early work. Money was promptly raised and extensive surveys were made. And it should be stated here that Dr. Wozencraft originally planned to divert the water from the Colorado, using the channel of the Alamo River as a canal for that purpose. And this plan was now adopted by this company. One hundred thousand acres of land in Lower California, extending from the Colorado on the east to the mountains on the west, were purchased from Sr. G. Andrade, thus securing a right of way through this foreign territory.\n\nThen for three years this company was overtaken by new vicissitudes. The work of construction could not proceed for the lack of money. In 1899, however, S. W. Ferguson, of San Francisco, becoming interested in the company, was duly commissioned to finance the project among his friends on the Pacific Coast. As a result of an important interview with Mr. L. M. Holt in San Francisco, he came to Los Angeles and was introduced to Mr. George Chaffey, one of the founders of Etiwanda and Ontario, who had recently returned from Australia, where he had been engaged in building the irrigation system of Mildura on the Murray River. A few days later these three gentlemen visited the desert and spent three weeks investigating the advisability of the scheme. Mr. Rockwood, who was then in New York City, was sent for and spent several weeks more with Mr. Chaffey in further investigations. The latter, though much pleased with the enterprise, was not quite satisfied with the terms offered him, and he therefore declined to undertake the work. Mr. Rockwood was about to return to New York and give up the scheme. But Mr. Holt, being still sanguine of success, thought he could formulate a plan that would satisfy all parties interested, and he was thereupon authorized to go ahead. After working some weeks on this proposition, which was finally submitted to Mr. Chaffey, he then consented to undertake the work on this basis. Dr.\n\nHeffernan, Mr. Blaisdell and Mr. Rockwood were consulted, and the result was that Mr. Chaffey was fully authorized to begin the work. He was given control of the California Development Company for five years, and a certain portion of the stock of that company if he succeeded in constructing a successful irrigation system that would put water upon this desert land.\n\nAbout this time the Imperial Land Company, the colonizing agency, was incorporated, of which Mr. Ferguson was made manager, holding one-fifth of the stock of that company. After beginning the work, however, he was not entirely satisfied with his share of the bargain and sought a power of attorney from Mr. Holt that he might vote his one-fifth share of the stock of the company and thus gain control of the corporation, which he regarded necessary in order to make his work effective. With this stock of Mr. Holt he expected to secure enough more to give him the control he desired. But Mr. Holt declined this request, and then Mr. Ferguson sought to retaliate by forcing him out of the company. In order to avoid any conflict at this stage of the enterprise, Mr. Holt finally exchanged his stock in the Imperial Land Company for that of the California Development Company. A few months later Mr. Ferguson's management became so undesirable that he was asked to resign. On his refusal to do this he was removed soon afterward, and all his interests in the company passed into other hands.\n\nMORE PRELIMINARY TROUBLES\n\nUp to this time President Heber of the California Company had not seemed to take any active interest in its affairs. But now this new turn of affairs brought him to the front, and he took the position of manager to fill the vacancy.\n\nThus in February 1902, Mr. Heber and his associates purchased the stock of Mr. Chaffey, who thereupon retired from the company. Mr. Heber then became president and general manager of the California Company, and also of the Imperial Land Company, of which he made E. C. Paulin general manager.\n\nHere is, therefore, a pretty full sketch of the men, capital, and various corporations that formed this combination for the reclamation and colonization of this desert land. And it is believed to be the most extensive project of the kind ever made in arid America up to this time. It involved so many problems which could only be solved by the expenditure of a vast sum of money under the direction of the most eminent and competent engineers in the country. And today it is claimed that there is no other place in America where these works can be duplicated, covering such a vast area to be reclaimed and so large a population to be served. The national government is now spending more money on smaller enterprises for the reclamation of much smaller areas, and for the benefit of a much smaller population. It is further claimed that no other place under the Stars and Stripes today has a single irrigation system that will irrigate so large an area and furnish homes for so many people. It is also believed that no other large area in the land can be reclaimed at such small cost per acre, or where the water can be perpetually furnished to settlers at so small a cost per acre-foot, as is now being done by this Imperial Canal system in this wonderful Imperial Valley over the portion of this worthless Colorado Desert which has been rescued by the hand of man from the vast sand-waste which the great Creator seems to have forgotten to finish.\n\nIt is now very apparent, however, that he has called in the assistance of men in the reclamation and development of this vast territory, and that they have succeeded beyond all precedent, and under a smiling providence, this great valley is blossoming with an unparalleled degree of fertility and productiveness.\n\nBack of all this, of course, is the subject of irrigation, an indispensable prerequisite to the reclamation of arid lands. But for this, nearly half the area of this republic would be of small agricultural value today.\n\nIn Imperial Valley the system of irrigation in use is the most complete possible under the existing law of California. For over 25 years the whole question received most careful study by enterprising men in Southern California. As a result the mutual company plan was finally adopted for the ownership and management of the Imperial Canal system as far as that plan could be utilized. The first obstacle that arose was the magnitude of the enterprise. Five hundred thousand acres of land for 100,000 people under one company did not seem entirely feasible. It was therefore decided to restrict the area to 100,000 acres for a single irrigation system. And even this has since been thought too large. With 100 voters to elect a board of directors of a water company, there is a much greater feeling of individual personal responsibility than would be possible if 1000 voters shared in the control. And if this tract was sub-divided into 40-acre holdings, there would be 2,500 voters, which might not secure the best results.\n\nIn this Imperial Valley there are 538,000 acres now under the Imperial Canal system, while still barren land will raise the total to nearly a million. It was therefore decided to divide the Valley into districts, no one to exceed 100,000 irrigable acres; such districts, as far as possible, to have natural boundary lines. Then it was thought best to have a separate company for each of these districts, all such companies to be organized on a similar basis, in order that the landowner in one company should have the same rights and responsibilities as the owner in each of the other companies. All these companies should have the same name and be designated only by number.\n\nUnder this plan, Imperial Water Company No. 1 was formed with 100,000 shares of stock to furnish water for 100,000 acres of land in a territory bounded on the west by New River, on the east by the Alamo River, on the south by the Mexican boundary line, and on the north by an arbitrary line running between two rows of sections. While this tract exceeded the limit by some 50,000 acres, only 100,000 were regarded available for successful irrigation. And yet since then the actual irrigable area is found to be much larger, and the disposition of this extra land has since been a problem with the company. Since then other companies of this kind have been formed and now reach 15 in number.\n\nThe next obstacle to present itself was the impossibility of all these going to the Colorado River, 60 miles away, to get their water supply. But this was finally overcome by the construction of a canal through foreign territory, which, of course, added greatly to the cost, and made it almost prohibitory for a small company. But here the California Development Company, which financed the plan for the construction of the canal system, and owned most of the canals through Lower California, agreed to such contracts as were necessary to deliver water to each of these several mutual companies. Under this agreement this parent company was to keep these main canals in repair and deliver the water in bulk, charging a uniform price of 50 cents an acre-foot. That is, 50 cents for enough water to cover an acre of land one foot in depth. This is practically two cents an inch for a 24 hours flow. This parent company would thus construct a distributing system of canals for the mutual company and receive in payment the entire capital stock of such company. This stock would in turn be sold to settlers and the parent company would get its pay for the construction works and the mutual company would get its distributing system built and paid for in a way that would leave no indebtedness. The landowners would thus own and operate their own distributing system through each of these mutual companies. The water rates would be collected from the settlers in January and July, paying the development company for all the water received during the preceding six months. Such contracts were made for the permanent delivery of water at a fixed price, and all settlers are served alike. In this way each settler pays 50 cents per acre for his water whether he uses it or not. It will be seen that this provision precludes speculators from taking up land and buying water stock for the same and then wait for an advance in price to sell out at a handsome margin without improving the land at all. This wise provision has proven very popular. But for this requirement settlers might have found themselves surrounded with dry, desert lands with no neighbors.\n\nSuch was the plan at the beginning of development of the Valley, and it ran on for a series of years, but, as stated in a separate article herein, the time came when the people threw aside the private corporation owning the irrigation system and acquired it for themselves through the organization of the Imperial Irrigation District, under the laws of the state.\n\nSOME OF THE RESULTS\n\nIt will be of interest to record here what has really been done under this great reclamation project in Imperial County thus far. Actual work upon the system was begun in April 1900, and the first water was delivered to the fields in June 1901. In the following July there were about 6,000 acres of land put into crops in order to feed the hundreds of teams working on the canal system. In 1902 this acreage of tillage was increased to 25,000, and the next year this was doubled. In 1904 this cultivated area was increased to 150,000 acres. And now something over 250,000 acres of government land has been filed upon and water rights secured for the same. In 1903 the California Development Company built about 600 miles of canals, some of which are 70 feet in depth at the bottom and carry water ten feet deep.\n\nThe permanent population of the Valley is now about 50,000, and other settlers are coming in rapidly. Of course, as the wonderful possibilities for agricultural development became apparent railway construction was promptly begun, and the iron horse of commercial progress soon appeared upon the scene. The Southern Pacific Company built a branch line of 28 miles from Old Beach to Imperial, soon after extended to Calexico, another 16 miles, and thence on Mexican soil to Yuma, Arizona. On this branch are the thriving towns of Niland, Calipatria, Brawley, Imperial, El Centro, Heber and Calexico. A 12-mile cross line was built from El Centro to Holtville, which is being extended westwardly to San Diego, now reaching the towns of Seeley and Dixieland. Another cross line has recently been constructed westwardly from Calipatria to Westmoreland.\n\nThis shows that the original projectors of this great reclamation enterprise were not idle dreamers, \"as many short-sighted people in that region even had openly declared.\n\nThis great Colorado River has often been called the Nile of America because of the rich and fertile sediment carried down by its waters, and also because of similarity of climate and water supply.\n\nThe agricultural development has run in well marked stages, beginning on the new land as each section was developed, with barley, alfalfa following, and then coming by degrees more intensive operations. Barley ranks first among the grains, milo following, with comparatively small production of wheat. But in late years cotton has become the chief crop of the Valley in acreage and value. Fat cattle, sheep and hogs are shipped in great numbers, and the dairy industry has taken second place among California counties.\n\nImperial County leads the world in acreage of cantaloupes, while grapes and asparagus are important early products. But for the slow progress of propagation, dates would long before this have become a most important product. The annual productiveness of Imperial Valley has reached a range of from twenty to forty million dollars a year.\n\nThe products of this reclaimed land have already been increased in number. One of these new crops is the Egyptian long staple cotton, which gives very profitable crops of fibre and which is most valuable in the textile markets, bringing over 22 cents a pound previous to the recent advance in all varieties of cotton because of the war.\n\nOf course, the climate of this Imperial Valley is very warm in summer, from April to October, often reaching 100 in the shade. And yet the air is so exceptionally dry as to permit work even during the hottest days without great discomfort. The wet and dry bulb thermometers show a greater variation than in a humid country, being about five degrees in the latter during the summer and about 31 degrees in this valley.\n\nSOME EARLY IRRIGATION HISTORY\n\nThis having been the supreme creative factor in the reclamation of this great desert waste makes it imperative that some specific mention should be made here. But the reader will find this subject treated with scientific detail in subsequent chapters of this work by the most competent authority in the land. And this man once dreamed of writing a romantic history of this wonderful valley. And if space were at command in this volume a thrilling and racy thread of romance could be interwoven in this story-fabric of detail that begins with the discovery of this sandy-sink of the Colorado Desert, and follows down the years of its development and reclamation until the glowing results of today were reached.\n\nBut for irrigation there could, of course, have been no Imperial Valley nor any Imperial County to write about.\n\nWithout entering deeply into the ancient history of irrigation and the date of its origin, it may be said that modern scientists seem to agree that it was in use in very ancient times, and was used in this hemisphere at the dawn of civilization. Early explorers found extensive and successful systems in Mexico, Central America and Peru. Even in our own land are traces of early irrigation projects that had been carried out along the Colorado, Rio Grande and Gila Rivers. In India some of the most costly and magnificent engineering enterprises of this kind are found today. And most of the foreign countries are operating extensive systems of this kind.\n\nModern reclamation in America in 1890 had nearly four million arid acres to its credit. But these systems were in no way comparable with those used in this Imperial Valley in extent. The reclaimed area in this valley at this time is far greater than was the total in the southern third of California in 1890. In India there are twenty-five million acres of such land, in Egypt about six millions, Italy about three millions, France 400,000, and in the United States about four millions of arid acres. Thus some forty millions of arid acres have been brought under successful cultivation by irrigation. Not, however, until 1902 was the construction of irrigation systems under the control of the Secretary of the Interior begun. This plan has been successfully carried out since then by the Reclamation service, the sole purpose being the transformation of desert lands into attractive and productive farm property.\n\nThe Colorado Desert was visited at least by military parties in 1846, and geological investigations were made in 1853. It was surveyed by government contractors in 1855 and 1856, and the overland stations were established there in 1858. It was resurveyed in 1880, and finally crossed by the railway soon after. The reclamation project was proposed in 1892, and again in 1902, which finally resulted in the adoption of the irrigation scheme. Since that time the enterprise has been duly exploited in the public press.\n\nThis tract in 1846, being still a part of the Mexican territory, was frequently visited by Mexican desperadoes, and General Phil Kearny's famous expedition by the Santa Fe Trail to the coast crossed the Valley. With this expedition was a corps of government engineers who were to make observations and report as to the topography, natural history and geography of the region. The date of this report was November 1855. It stated that at the ford of the Colorado, where the engineers crossed, the river was 1,500 feet wide and flowed at the rate of 1 1/2 miles per hour, the greatest depth there being four feet. The banks were not over four feet high, and evidences of overflow were found. The water was torpid and hence immense drifts of sand were encountered. A few days later a basin or lake was reached (probably Badger Lake, now dry) and this was then about 3/4 x 1/2 mile in extent and too salt for the use of man or beast. Their report of this desert contained this: \"Ninety miles from water to water is an immense triangular plain bounded on one side by the Colorado River, on the west by the Cordilleras of California, on the northeast by a chain of mountains running southeast and northwest.\" This report has a record of many hardships endured by the men under Lieutenant W. H. Morey, who was in charge. They had a sharp engagement with the Mexicans at Los Angeles, where he planted the American flag to stay, however.\n\nAnother military expedition was sent out in 1853 under Lieutenant Williamson, with Professor William P. Blake as naturalist, who afterward wrote a graphic description of the desert and the result of his geological studies there. He concluded that the physical aspects of the desert were due to flood erosion upon rocks near Palm Springs. He also predicted that potable water could be obtained from artesian wells in that region, which proved true 35 years later, and again by the engineers of the Southern Pacific railway.\n\nIn 1858 the first overland mail route between St. Louis and San Francisco was established, it being known as the Butterfield Stage Line. This trip took 22 days and was made every two weeks. There were three stage stations on the desert. That same year, however, America had a much more important event to record in that region. This was the discovery of the possibility of reclaiming this Colorado Desert. Dr. Oliver M. Wozencraft, a native of Ohio, who had been educated in Kentucky, was the first man who seriously proposed to bring the waters of the Colorado River into this sink for the purpose of agriculture by irrigation. Like many other men who have conceived great ideas ahead of their time, Dr. Wozencraft was laughed at as an airy dreamer at the time. But he had this project so thoroughly mapped out in his mind that had it not been for the breaking out of the Civil war in 1860, the full consummation of his plans would probably have been carried out, or at least begun at that very time. And it is interesting to note here that his original ideas were very similar to those embodied in the final project which were carried out so many years later. But he joined the great gold rush in 1849, being the Indian agent at the time. He was also instrumental in securing the railway line from the east to cross this desert. In his diary of that time he describes most graphically his first excursion to that region in May 1849, which might well be quoted here in full if space permitted. It was on this trip when he first conceived the idea of reclaiming this great desert. He presented his scheme to the California Legislature, which promptly ceded him all state rights in the construction of his proposed reclamation plan of this desert waste. He next took the matter to Congress, where he received a favorable report from the committee in charge. But then the crash of arms at Fort Sumter prevented any further action at the time. At the close of the war he lost no time in the prosecution of his one absorbing purpose. But during the troubles attendant upon the reconstruction period after the war it was crowded aside from time to time in the maze of national affairs. Thus on the eve of the session in 1887, when another hearing had been promised him, he was suddenly stricken ill and died. In writing of her father's pet project afterward, his daughter said he had lost a fortune and had finally given up his life in the effort to achieve success. And yet some think he was ahead of his time, the precise period for the consummation of his project, even if successfully carried out at that time, might not have proved for the best interests of the region. The railway was not built until 20 years later. And yet Dr. Wozencraft is still credited as being the \"father of the Imperial Valley.\"\n\nTHE COLORADO ASSERTS ITSELF\n\nAmong the first travelers on the new railway line was Mr. H. S. Worthington of Kentucky. He, too, saw the great latent possibilities that presented themselves in this valley and he enlisted the interest of financial friends in the matter, and tried to induce eastern capitalists to join in the project. But nothing came of it. Then in 1883 the New Liverpool Salt Company viewed the matter from a wholly different side. They filed on some of this salt land, leased a portion of the railway and went to work scraping the salt in vast layers from many square miles of these salt bottoms, using steam plows and then purifying the product. It was the economic and business end of the proposition as it then presented itself which appealed to this company. And their profits were large until the great Colorado River came down as of yore and protested to such a mercenary perversion of its natural advantages. This flood came in 1905, 1906 and 1907, and the salt company's plant was wiped out completely for all time. Then the great river had its way and left a great lake sleeping in the sun, which finally absorbed the water and left another great waste.\n\nBut now the great transformation was close at hand. The Colorado was here flowing nearly fifty feet above the sea, while the floor of the valley, in some places, was 150 feet below the sea. It was thus easy for the engineer to see the possibilities for irrigation of this great sunken valley. The railway crossing this desert made a ready market for all products of the soil. And yet at that time little was known of the marvelous fertility of this salt sediment. But the early settlers were impressed with the combination of favoring conditions. Careful observers and writers of that period began, even in January 1901, to predict wondrous things for the Valley under proper irrigation.\n\nIt was seen that the territory was distinctly an agricultural section, and must depend upon that feature alone for success after its reclamation. Government students found five kinds of soil in this basin: dune sand, sand, sandy loam, loam and clay. This material had blown into the desert from the beaches on the west and northwest, and would eventually, in combination with the other soils, form good arable land, they thought. The underlying subsoil had much organic matter, including nitrogen and potash. And yet it was said that less than one per cent of all the land in this basin would prove worthless for high cultivation.\n\nBut the result was far better than any had hoped for.\n\nAt Yuma this Colorado water was analyzed and found to carry silt having a fertilizing value of $1.65 to each three-acre foot. Climate, soil and air therefore here formed a combination of necessary factors for productive success in this Imperial Valley. The Secretary of Agriculture at Washington in 1910 said: \"We must look to the west, especially the reclaimed west, to add sufficiently to our productive area, and to care for the increased demand which the next few years will show.\"\n\nHere was the Southern Pacific railway, with enormous capital and every facility, controlled by men keenly alive to the importance of the business of this Valley, who knew that the company's interests were closely connected with the development of the Valley. Of course, the early settlers were confronted with the high cost of transportation and living expenses generally. But this was materially offset by cheap poultry, eggs, dairy products, honey and some vegetables. Water for domestic use in the midst of a desert with streams of alkali deposits was, of course, a serious problem at first. And yet it was found that during eight months of the year, after proper filtration, this water was potable and even healthful.\n\nSuch, then, were some of the economic conditions that prevailed in this Imperial Valley in the summer of 1902 when the district had already become a recognized factor in the scheme of reclamation. The towns of Calexico and Imperial were well organized and the population was increasing. And yet it must be said there was some anxiety regarding the narrow stream of water flowing from the Colorado to the distributing canals of the mutual water companies. Anything that might interfere with the even flow of this water would, of course, endanger the whole enterprise. But the commercial progress of the region during 1902 and 1903 continued rapid and was greatly accelerated by the construction of the branch railway from the Southern Pacific at Old Beach, though only grading had been begun on this contract at first. The company soon took up the work in. earnest and the road was completed early in 1903. This gave the Valley a great boom. In April of that year the total acreage in crops was about 25,000, 6,220 in wheat, 14,423 in barley and smaller areas in other grains and alfalfa. Then there were large areas devoted to fruit, melons and other vegetables. These crops would have been much larger in fact but for the inadequate supply of canals owing to financial difficulties. But in the following year this acreage had been increased to 100,000 and the population to about 7,000. In 1904 the steam railway line had been extended to Calexico, which was already a thriving trade center. The towns of Brawley and Silsbee were next reached by the canal system, and water companies Nos. 4, 5 and 7 began operations. The town of Imperial grew with marvelous rapidity, a fine hotel and various other business houses being built. About that time the Imperial Land Company became an important factor in the progress and development of this place. But at this stage some defect was discovered in construction at the Hanlon head-gate. It was found too small, and the money needed to remedy the evil could not be had at that time. In addition to this, the Department of Agriculture at Washington made an attack upon the soil and they also claimed, through the Reclamation Service officials, that Imperial Valley had really no right to use this Colorado water. But as usual, these matters were temporarily adjusted and overcome for the time, however. But there were various other obstacles of a kindred nature that were encountered afterward, due, in part, to an excessive amount of silt that was being thrown into the canal by the Colorado River. There were then about 9,000 people in that valley and their crops covered some 150,000 acres. They all wanted water and must have it. But even this was soon remedied, and the clouds that had hung over the years of 1905, 1906 and 1907 all vanished. But it was the beginning of the end of the California Development Company.\n\nSOME OF THE RESULTS\n\nAccording to a report made in 1913, there were then about 250,000 reclaimed acres under cultivation in this Imperial Valley. The soil seemed well adapted to the growth of practically every crop that was grown in the United States, with very few exceptions, such as some of the deciduous fruits, which required a period of frost and snow which are never known in this Valley. A leading crop pf late has been the alfalfa plant, which can be cut from six to nine times each year with an average of one ton to each cutting. It can also be used for forage part of the year and cut later for fodder. It remains green all through the year, although in December and January the cool nights retards the growth. And yet alfalfa is still considered one of the greatest wealth producers in the Valley. As a producer of beef, pork and mutton, it is without an equal. Farmers are reaping enormous profits from their alfalfa fields. In three years a plot of ground rented for some $500 attained a value of $16,000. Good alfalfa land is now worth about $175 per acre and rents for about $15 an acre per year.\n\nAmong the newer crops, however, in this region is cotton, which is being very successfully grown, and yields a bale per acre. Already there are many cotton gins in operation, and at El Centro and Calexico there are cottonseed-oil mills, which, after extracting the oil, grind the seed into meal. The different varieties of corn do well here, and often two crops are secured in a season, except from the Indian corn. The first crop can be cut down and another crop grown without replanting. Barley is also a sure crop and yields from 18 to 35 sacks per acre. Used as hay for fodder, it yields from two to four tons an acre.\n\nLivestock of all kinds is extensively raised throughout the entire Valley. And it is said that here the yearlings attain the size and growth of the two-year-old in any other part of the stock-growing sections of the country. This is attributed to the continuous feed of green fodder and the escape of the rigors of winter. Many large cattle companies are already established here.\n\nAnother most attractive and profitable product in this Valley is the cantaloupe. A leading center of this growing industry is Brawley. Nearly 3,000 carloads of this delicious table dessert are annually shipped from this point, and the returns are from $100 to $300 per acre. This product is now being rapidly increased, a larger acreage being devoted to its culture. Oranges and lemons have not been a commercial success, but grapefruit is grown most successfully. The apricot is another very valuable fruit product here, yielding from $500 to $750 per acre in favorable seasons under proper culture. Large returns from the growth of asparagus are also reported. It is shipped in carload lots to New York and Chicago in February and March. One rancher cleared $10,000 from this vegetable alone in 1912, from 45 acres of land. After the shipping season closes it is canned for market. Dates are also a very profitable crop, often yielding 300 pounds per tree, worth from fifty cents to one dollar a pound. Table grapes are also doing well in the Valley, and there are several large vineyards. Muscats, Malagas, Thompson's Seedless and a few Persian sorts are usually grown. They ripen late in June and are thus off the market when other sections begin to ship, thus securing the top price.\n\nSuch is merely a brief summary of a few of the products of this marvelous Valley where the land valuations have increased from nothing in 1900 to $14,000,000 in 1912, and $20,000,000 to $40,000,000 now. Since 1912, however, the construction of the new High Line Canal east of the Alamo River has added some 125,000 acres for cultivation. This extends from the Mexican boundary to the Southern Pacific main line tracks. Much of this was part of the government grant to this company. It is therefore apparent that the water supply in this vast area is inexhaustible, and it is furnished to the farmers at very low cost. It further appears that the soil of this Valley is the richest and most fertile to be found in the American Union today.\n\nIn the east it is very common to denounce the prevalent practice in financial circles of \"watering stocks\" â watering stocks of companies, corporations and securities of every name and nature. The practice has resulted in loss or ruin to millions of victims all over the land. All manner of legal restrictions have been resorted to by legislatures to prevent such frauds. But on the whole success has been very scant and indifferent at best.\n\nBut here in this great Imperial Valley of California water has really done the whole trick and proved the salvation of thousands. We call it \"irrigation\" here, as it might also be termed in the east. But in this Valley it has completely transformed a vast desert waste of only a few years ago into a glorious garden of fertility and production where thousands of people are now dwelling in comfort and prosperity. And the end is not yet in sight.\n\nIMPERIAL COUNTY\n\nThis being among the latest productions of this wonderful Valley, reference to it in this record has been deferred to this later chapter. It is, of course, very evident that no such civil division could have been created here until there was a place to put it, or even something to make it from. Then, too, there was no necessity for it, and the settlers were too busy with other things of more importance to their present existence, and did not feel the need of any such local government. It was even doubtful whether there were any political aspirants in the region as yet. This class of idle diplomats is rarely found among the pioneers of undeveloped lands. They come in later after the way of progress has been duly blazed.\n\nAll this territory had been included in San Diego County from a much earlier period. This great desert region had always been regarded as the most worthless part of that old county. Nobody ever expected that anything good could come out of this vast salt marsh and sandy waste. But in July 1907, a petition having been received from some of the leading residents of that Valley for a division of the old county and creation of a new county in this Valley, a resolution was finally passed by the San Diego Board of Supervisors calling for an election to pass on this question. The proposed line of division was the section line between ranges eight and nine of the San Bernardino Mountains. The territory embraced in this new county approximated 4,000 square miles in extent and then had a population of 20,320.\n\nThis election was accordingly held on August 6, 1907. Then, on August 12, the vote having been almost unanimous for the erection of the new county, its birth was promptly, though not very loudly, announced.\n\nThere is no special record of any public proclamation or celebration of the event. In fact, these settlers were not given to demonstrations of this character. Meanwhile, however, there had been an active contest for the location of the county seat, especially between the friends of Imperial and El Centro. The result was that the latter, though much younger than Imperial, won the victory by a very small margin of votes. This led to a close contest which for a time came near being taken to the courts for decision. But better counsel prevailed in the end and a board of supervisors was duly elected for the new county. The first session of this local legislature was held in the Valley State Bank building when Mr. F. S. Webster, of the third district, was chosen chairman. And in this place it is significant to record that the very first measure which was adopted by these pioneer officials and settlers here assembled as local lawmakers, was an ordinance prohibiting the sale or distribution of malt or spirituous liquors anywhere in the county except under the most rigorous restrictions. The third ordinance, passed at a subsequent meeting, was a measure prohibiting gambling or betting. This will give some idea of the general character and personal motives of these early settlers from a moral standpoint at least. They were determined to begin right, and they did, for these laws were duly enforced.\n\nThe first sheriff was Mr. Mobley Meadows, and he secured a temporary courthouse in a part of an old furniture warehouse and real estate office. Two of these rooms were set apart for a jail in which to confine malefactors. It seems that the parent county of San Diego had refused to divide up a proper share of the public moneys to the new county. But these pioneers were not contentious, and after a time a satisfactory settlement of the whole matter was made in an amicable manner.\n\nNear the close of 1907 a fine new jail structure had been completed and the county offices were removed to the new building. Two years later a site for a permanent courthouse building was selected west of the Date Canal. But sometime before this the first newspaper in the town was established. The importance and value of a newspaper in the progress and development of any new country, and especially in this Valley county, cannot be overestimated, and this well-edited sheet was fully recognized by these intelligent and enterprising people, who have given it proper support.\n\nEl Centro â The town of El Centro, now the capital of the new county, had antedated the county itself by some two years in its organization. The town-site belonged to Mr. W. F. Holt, and a flag station named Cabarker had been established there by the Southern Pacific Railway. Mr. Holt sold this site to a Redlands syndicate which exploited it under the name of El Centro, which has been retained ever since. There was a hotel which had been moved over from Imperial, two small residences owned by Dr. Anderson, also moved from Imperial, and a small real estate office on Main Street. Water was received from a lateral ditch leading from the canal west of the town. The construction of the present El Centro hotel was soon begun and also the Holt Opera House. And yet, it must be said, that this shire town of the county then contained only about a dozen permanent settlers. But the abounding faith in the rapid development of that region, which had animated these people from the beginning, actuated them still. And today El Centro has a population of 7,500 and a total of building operations in a year of nearly one million dollars. In 1912 the various industrial structures there were valued at $241,900; commercial buildings, $83,300; educational structures, $65,000; residences, churches and hospitals, $16,400; hotels, restaurants, etc., $15,700, a total of over half a million dollars. There were 81 new residences built that year at an average cost of $2,000. And the total assessment of the land has increased $10,000,000. All this was accomplished in six years.\n\nThe Town of Imperial â This was staked out by the Imperial Land Company in the geographical center of the irrigable area in the fall of 1900. Dr. W. T. Heffernan was the pioneer merchant, who built a store there and stocked it with general merchandise. A tent hotel was opened by Millard F. Hudson about the same time, and a house for religious worship for the Christian Church was built in 1901. And here again the printing press took its place in the front rank of public endeavor. It was the Imperial Press, edited by Mr. Henry C. Reid, whose daughter Ruth was the first baby born in the town. The pastor of this first church was the Rev. John C. Hay, whose initial congregation numbered just six persons. Mr. W. F. Holt and Le Roy Holt and his wife were of this number. But the town now began to grow rapidly in size and importance. The Imperial Land Company opened a new hotel in the summer of 1904. Mr. Reid guided the destinies of the Imperial Press from May until October in 1901, when he was succeeded by Edgar F. Howe. During Mr. Reid's control he published a graphic sketch of the new town as he first saw it in March 1901. Material had arrived for the erection of the Press building, together with living apartments for the editor and his family. This structure was soon a reality through the efforts of a jolly bunch of friends under the command of W. F. Holt. The printing machinery was in place while the walls and roof were being built around it and even while the first edition of the paper was being put in type. When it is stated that the fixed population of the desert city that first summer was less than a dozen, it will be seen that the editor's neighbors were not very numerous. How he obtained his news, his subscriptions, or his money to pay his office staff does not appear.\n\nCalexico â On the border line of the new county, and its sister town of Mexicali, is one of the most prominent towns in the Valley, being tributary to a vast extent of territory in Mexico that is very fertile, having large ranches producing wheat, barley, cotton and similar crops. It owns its water and sewer system, has well-lighted streets, miles of concrete sidewalks, avenues of fine shade trees, splendid schools and churches. The California Development Company has its offices here. The United States Custom House is here, and there is a large industrial district for handling cotton, gins, oil mills, compress, etc., warehouses and many fine blocks of buildings.\n\nHeber is four miles from this point northward and has become one of the largest shipping stations for stock, hay and grain in the Valley. It also ships many carloads of cantaloupes in the season and it has a good hotel.\n\nBrawley, nine miles north of Imperial, is the great cantaloupe center of the Valley, some 3,000 carloads of this luscious fruit being shipped from here annually. And it is claimed that this place produces more vegetable products than all the other towns in the Valley combined. It is a very progressive town, owns its own water and sewer systems, has a fine public park, several social clubs and churches, cotton gins and a creamery. Among the leading vegetable products are dates, apricots, grapes, peppers, beans and peas. It has the largest cantaloupe packing shed in the west.\n\nHoltville, also an incorporated city, is rated as the gem of the East Side section. It is the only one in the Valley having artesian water. Much public spirit has been shown here, and there are many public improvements with others in prospect. The adjacent territory is mainly devoted to alfalfa, cotton, grain and stock-raising, although an extensive acreage is now being planted with the cantaloupe melon. It is claimed that this is the only place in the United States where one can eat breakfast below sea level and sleep above it. The Holton Power Company here supplies the entire Valley with electricity, and the great plant is operated by water power.\n\nIn addition to the towns briefly mentioned there are Calipatria, Silsby, Dixieland and many other smaller settlements all through the Valley which are ready to blossom into business activity. Vacant houses are unknown in any of these towns today.\n\nSuch is the record of the men who came into this Valley knowing it was a forbidden desert without a redeeming feature. It must be apparent to anyone that it took a vast amount of courage and persistence to start the development of a ranch of any kind here in those old pioneer days. They had to brave the storms miles from any supplies, and away from all the comforts and advantages of civilization. Even ten years ago there was only a single telephone line to Flowing Wells, forty miles to the railway. Now there are all manner of modern facilities all through the Valley, and the newcomers may go and come at will. But it always takes men of this class, full of courage and determination, to blaze the way of civilization and progress in any new country like that. Those who are made of milder stuff are always ready to follow where they see that success has been already achieved, ad in this they are quite willing to share liberally.\n\nTHE CLIMATE\n\nThis is a subject susceptible of a great variety of definitions. It covers many aspects and features not readily embraced in few words. Of these, temperature is only one, though most important perhaps in the average range throughout the year. We often read of this or that place being endowed by Nature with the \"finest climate in the world.\" But she rarely distributes her favor so lavishly in one spot. And such an expression really means very little in the abstract anyway. It gives the average person only a partial notion of the general meteorological conditions that prevail. There are so many elements that enter into the final estimate of climate in any particular place that personal investigation extending over a considerable period of time seems almost imperative. Then, in addition to all this, there is also a wide diversity of opinion in regard to just what constitutes the best climate. Perhaps no two persons would precisely agree upon this fundamental point. And this is as it should be, or the various latitudes of the earth would not all be inhabited. People become adapted to the climatic conditions which prevail in the region where they live.\n\nThe term \"equable\" is usually applied in speaking of the most desirable climate enjoyed by human beings. Old geographic writers designated it in this rather indefinite manner when they meant neither too hot nor too cold, too dry nor too wet, but just pleasant most of the time, without any extremes of temperature or any violent atmospheric disturbances. And this is perhaps an ideal condition of the air that most nearly agrees with the average human mind. And yet some people are not entirely satisfied with such uniform conditions. They find it monotonous and prefer changes, though very apt to rebel sharply when these changes become very sudden and drastic.\n\nClimate therefore depends primarily upon temperature, of course, but also upon the relative humidity of the atmosphere. And all these things depend upon the location of the place with reference to the equator, not only, but the altitude above the sea. The terms climate and weather, however, should not be used indiscriminately, as there is a distinction between them. Climate is a condition of a place with relation to certain meteorological phenomena, and the term weather has reference to these phenomena themselves.\n\nAs to the climate of this Imperial Valley, nine months of the year are considered perfect, and without any rival. It is extremely rare that the region is visited by frost. There are no violent storms, and rains are seldom known. But the remaining three months of every year are methodically and admittedly hot. But it is at this very time that the green things growing are improving every shining hour, and making the farmer's heart glad. And yet settlers soon become inured to this heat, and both men and teams work without much discomfort. It is cool in the shade and the nights are always cool, affording restful sleep, while the sleeper dreams of his rapidly ripening fruit and their early arrival in the markets to catch the top prices ahead of other competitors in less favorable regions.\n\nLOOKING BACK\n\nThere is so much of interest in the Valley Year Book of 1902 as indicated by Jose Huddleston in her contribution to the history of the following year that the writer takes the liberty of quoting copious excerpts therefrom in this chapter. It shows the contrasting conditions between then and now in this great Valley in a vivid manner.\n\nShe arrived at Flowing Wells in October 1901, and she called that the \"jumping off place,'' or the end of civilization. Nothing was visible then but glistening sand, a little sagebrush and mesquite. Her little party spent the night under a tent in the desert and without sleep. Next morning at six she took the stage for Imperial, 33 miles away. They finally reached there at four in the afternoon and again stopped under a tent, kept this time by a Chinaman in payment of the rent, wood and water being furnished him by the owners. The land company had a very small office in the town, and Le Roy Holt, now a banker, kept a small grocery store. The Imperial Valley Press was issued from this building every week over a miniature printing office where the printer's family lived. There was also a Christian Church building through the influence of W. F. Holt, and a school building, and these few small structures comprised the town of Imperial at that time. A little patch of sorghum was the only green spot in sight. This had been planted as an experiment by Mr. Patton and was the only touch of color in that great sand waste. Mr. Huddleston opened the first barber shop in October 1901. Then for the first time, it seems, the men of that Valley began to cut their hair and clip their beards. Soon after this two more tents were struck, and in one of these Mr. Huddleston baked bread with a gasoline stove, three loaves at a time, and 21 loaves a day. As room in this oven could be found he slipped in a pie. Of course, all were delighted with this homemade innovation. Then the writer relates in the following December the Valley was treated to a violent storm of snow, rain and sleet.\n\nWhen the first cow was brought in, tied behind a wagon, a great sensation was created. Mrs. Huddleston was keeping a restaurant, and the owner of the cow stopped there and told her she could have some fresh milk if she would milk the cow. It was the first milk she had seen in seven months. The main canal was then under construction and she received water through a small branch ditch when it was not choked with sand. In August 1902, the ice factory began operations there. But in the May previous she had gone to Calexico, which was separated from Mexico by a small ditch ten feet wide. A hotel, blacksmith shop, custom house office and half a dozen tents comprised this first town in the Valley at that time. Then this picturesque writer describes the beauties of the mirages seen in that region in this way, and says that those who have never lived where these wonderful aerial phenomena occur can have no conception of such beauties. \"On looking south we have often beheld the mountains turned upside down, one above the other.\n\nAt other times a full-rigged battleship was seen so plainly that even the port holes were visible. Again we have seen the ocean and watched the breakers sweeping over the sands, and could see the spray from the rolling waves. Toward the east there was an immense castle with beautiful turrets with iron bars at the windows. A little farther north there appeared to be a hole through the mountain which seemed about four feet in diameter, showing beautiful green on the other side. Another time, toward the east, an immense bird seemed to be feeding, a crane perhaps, with a bill about a foot and a half long.\"\n\n\"And so, where the winds have met, and the seas were swept aside, We have builded our homes, we have tilled the soil, and we view it all with pride.\"\n\nINDIAN OCCUPATION\n\nIt must be assumed that long before Columbus turned his Spanish prow toward this western hemisphere it was inhabited by a swarthy race of human beings whom we have been pleased to call Indians. Whence they came or how they originated are questions which have never yet been satisfactorily answered, nor ever will be. Ethnologists and other scientific investigators are still wrestling with these fundamental questions. And they arrive at different conclusions, just as they do as to the precise origin of the Negro race. But when this new western continent was discovered the Indian was found in possession of the lands under widely varying conditions and aspects, depending upon their location and mode of life. These people we have been content to designate as the native American race or aborigines. The Jesuit missionaries in this California peninsula divided them into three classes or tribes, the Pericues, Monquis\n\nand Cachimies. These tribes were subdivided into various branches, and again into families and rancherias. They were all tall, erect, robust and well formed, as a result of their nomadic life in the open air, together with their wildwood habits. Though not disagreeable in features, they seemed to delight in disfiguring themselves in various ways. Their complexions were somewhat darker than those found in Mexico, and became almost black as they grew older. Their hair was black and straight, but they had no beards. Their teeth were large, regular, and very white. This native population has been estimated as high as fifty thousand. But it is thought it did not really exceed half that number. A census of fifteen missions taken in 1767 found only about 12,000. In fact it is said that one might travel for days and not see a single Indian. No records have been found to show that they were in any way connected with any other tribe or people. As already remarked, no effort seems to have been made to trace their origin. That they were inhabiting such a desolate country of their own volition is hardly possible, and it has therefore been surmised that they were driven out of some more favored region by more powerful tribes, and then sought refuge among the vast wastes of this peninsula. They seemed devoid of all knowledge or even native intuition. They thought California was the entire world, visited no other people and had no visitors, cared mainly for filling their stomachs and toasting their shins in idleness. Even the native hunting instinct, so common with other Indians, seemed to be dormant in their minds if they had any minds at all. They wandered from place to place aimlessly, sleeping on the bare ground, rarely spending over one night in any one place. They rambled about in search of water, fruit and food of some kind. Only when ill did any of them get any sheltering hut. After their lessons at the mission they would squat on the floor. The men were entirely naked, and the women often wore belts around their waists if they wore anything. When given clothing they would discard it as soon as they got outside. They made sandals of deer skin, and sometimes wore strings of shells and berries in their hair and around their necks. They were armed with bows and arrows and had a few rude stone implements for digging roots. Baskets and cradles were made of tortoise shells. The men carried burdens upon their heads, the women upon their backs. They knew nothing about cooking and each cooked for himself. They ate anything and everything â roots, fruits, buds, seeds, and flesh of all kinds of animals, deer, wild-cats, mice, rats, bats, lizards, locusts, caterpillars and even snakes, old bones and carrion, so disgusting and filthy were their habits. And yet we are told they were healthy and rarely got sick, but remained strong and vigorous. They could endure hunger longer than the white man, but they were also gluttons and could gorge fuller. Seventeen watermelons and six pounds of unrefined sugar at a sitting was reported. But they made no intoxicating liquors, though on festive occasions they became drunk smoking wild tobacco. They practiced a crude form of polygamy, and their social customs were full of interest to the white man, though disgusting in the extreme. They had no form of religion or government of any kind until the missions were established. They had neither gods nor idols, nor any conception or dread of any hell before the missions were founded. When asked who made the sun, moon, stars, etc., they would answer \"aipekeriri,\" who knows that? There seemed to be no language of their own and very few words for anything they could not see, hear, touch, taste or smell, nor any words to express abstract ideas. In fact their native vocabulary was of the most meager description. Their language and culture went together.\n\nIn short here was a nomadic race which seemed to be regarded as the lowest scale of humanity. And if the chief end of life is to eat, drink, sleep and pass a painless existence, the Jesuit father was right in saying they were happy. They perhaps slept more soundly on the ground, under the open sky, than many European potentates under their gorgeous canopies on their downy beds. There were no troubles of any kind, nor any envy, jealousy, slander, or evils common to civilization. \"Where ignorance is bliss its folly to be wise\" is the much abused adage that seems to apply here.\n\nPerhaps the general characteristics of this native race in Lower California have been referred to in this general article more in detail than was absolutely necessary, although the briefest possible summary only has been presented from the earliest writers on the subject.\n\nHere in this Imperial Valley the tribal name of these nomadic denizens of the forest was Cucupah, closely related to the Yumas, though more industrious than the latter. They apparently lived then, as now, in the mountains of Mexico and only came to the desert valley at time of tribal wars. Here they left many large water and food jars, in preparation for a siege. All of them lived in this happy-go-lucky way among their savage instincts.\n\nThen, after succeeding generations, when Columbus had brought the white men over, it was rumored that this whole country was to be dominated by the white race, that would eventually crowd the Indians into the sea. Thus when the boats of these whites were reported in the Colorado River, upon which the Indians had depended for food and drink, a general massacre was planned by this whole tribe. This was about the year 1800, when Lieutenant Hardy of the British Navy led two expeditions well into this great western part of the continent in search of some river up which he could sail. He ascended the Gulf of California, making his way past many islands, shallows and sandbars with great difficulty and danger, and finally reached the mouth of the sluggish Colorado River. He pushed on to a small lake in which he anchored, and then went further for investigation. But as far as he could see there was nothing but a vast desert of sand, bare and desolate. Further progress being impossible here, he turned back and reported to his superior officers that the Colorado River was not navigable.\n\nIt should be added here that there has been some question whether or not this English officer was ever really in this river at all, although he called it the Colorado in his report and maps at the time. For a hundred years geographers thought he was mistaken, and yet he may have been right, as the main course of this erratic stream has changed many times since then. But upon this question however depends the fact\n\nwhether or not he was the first Englishman to look upon this vast Colorado desert. And the point is not a vital one after all ; in any event the great river was well worthy of his best efforts.\n\nTHE COLORADO\n\nThis is one of the longest rivers of the world when its tributaries are included. It begins at the junction of the Grand and Green rivers in the southeastern part of Utah, the whole river being really a continuation of the Colorado in its upper part. Its mileage is about 2,000, and the drainage is about 800 miles long, varying in width from 300 to 500 miles, with a total of something like 300,000 square miles. It flows\n\nthrough Wyoming, Colorado, Utah, Arizona, California, Nevada, New Mexico, and Mexico. The lower basin of the river is only slightly below sea level, with some mountain ranges rising 2,000 and 6,000 feet in the air. The upper part of this basin is from 4,000 to 8,000 feet above sea level, and it is bordered on the east, west and north by snow-clad mountains. Through this plateau there are deep gorges, transverse valleys and caanons which are dry most of the year. Among these and other tributaries in this district flow the waters that go to make up this sluggish and erratic river, which for untold centuries has carried down the silt and atoms of earth that were destined to transform this great Valley and make it blossom like the rose.\n\nSluggish streams with shallow settling basins, are required to produce this cargo of maturing debris. And here the story of the formation of the Colorado, now reclaimed, and the great Imperial Valley, its daughter, begins.\n\nIn 1853 government experts made exhaustive investigations of this region. After describing the bordering mountains, their report turns to the desert section, and says that it belongs to the type which physiographers describe as constructional, an area which has been depressed as a result of a crustal movement, as contrasted with valleys due to erosion. Its rock-floor or bottom is below tide even in those parts north of the Gulf where the actual surface is well below the sea. This indicates a subsidence of the earth's crust. A marked fault-line in the mountains show that the Valley simply dropped away at some time or other, either slowly or suddenly. There are therefore topographic characteristics of a faulted-block tilted toward the northeast and plunging into the desert toward the southeast. As the entire basin is occupied by lake silts and alluvium of most recent origin, it is evident that these fault movements were of a very late period. Everything strongly points therefore to the fact that this desert valley is associated with structures in which faults are prominent. When this valley-floor subsided there must have been a great inrush of the Gulf waters. Scientists agree that at a comparatively recent geological period this section was covered by the waters of the Pacific. It was here that the Colorado found its way in past ages and tumbled its load of silt year after year, forming at last a delta near its mouth which spread in time and buried the original floor of the Gulf under hundreds of feet of mud and alluvium, and finally cut the Gulf in two by building up the delta dam which separates this Gulf depression from that known as the Salton Sink.\n\nThe conclusions arrived at therefore by these government geologists are that this Colorado desert was not a desert at all at first, and only became so when the floor of the basin settled probably 1,000 feet, became inundated by the gulf, received the salt-laden waters of the Colorado and Gila rivers, with their numerous tributaries, thus forming a delta and lake was into which the water poured for centuries until the surface of the lake was about forty feet above the sea and extended over an area of more than 2,100 square miles, and finally receded gradually year after year, shrinking away entirely, leaving a great solid bed of soil, rich alluvium and detritus from 250 to 1,000 feet deep.\n\nGOVERNMENT ANTAGONISTIC\n\nIt is strange to record here that apparently from the very inception of this great reclamation enterprise the attitude of the national government seemed antagonistic. At times the work was much retarded from this cause, the operators becoming discouraged, and in some cases fell into discredit in the community. This opposition came, not only from the reclamation service department, but also from other branches of the government from which every assistance had been expected. This was mainly attributed to the dilatory tactics of the officials in sending inexperienced men to undertake work of such large importance. For instance, the soil survey made by the Agricultural Department in 1901 and 1902 resulted in such an unfavorable report that for a time operations were entirely stopped, and the faith in the enterprise became much impaired. The substance of this report was that the alkalies would rise to the surface and destroy all plant life. But the wisdom of that cruel prediction has been amply refuted from that time to this by the marvelous crops produced in the very parts of the Valley where the trouble was expected. And yet at the time the blow was a sad one for the projectors. There was also trouble from the Government Land Department. And this made it necessary that a resurvey of the lands in the Valley should be made. This was authorized by Congress in 1902, and it took seven years to complete it. But even this snarl of red tape was finally untangled.\n\nBut meanwhile the projectors were confronted with an empty treasury once more. Then resource was had to the Southern Pacific Railway Company, which was of course deeply interested in the development of the Valley. At the instigation of Mr. E. H. Harriman, after careful investigation, a loan of $200,000 was secured on certain conditions. But then came a break in the Colorado River in June 1905, which had been preceded by some water-sewage the past two years, due to some defects in the construction system. But again all these troubles, and many others which followed from periodical floods unprecedented, were successfully met and surmounted, as all others had been.\n\nOn the far eastern side of Imperial County are 17,000 acres of the finest land in the world which are now watered by the diversion of the Colorado River under the Laguna Dam system. This great dam is nearly a mile long by 240 feet wide, and it raises the water in the river about ten feet. It stands as a monument to the engineering skill of the government. It will eventually reclaim about 130,000 acres of land. And to this will be added some 100,000 acres from the Imperial Mesa land.\n\nThis new county, therefore, seems like an empire in itself, being 84 miles long from east to west and 54 miles from north to south, covering about 2,600,000 acres. About one-sixth of this, now known as Imperial Valley, lies in the middle of the county, extending toward the Mexican line toward the north some 40 miles. The Saltan Sea is in the western part of the county, the probable remains of the California Gulf.\n\nTHE WOMEN\n\nAnd this leads to some special mention of the women in this Valley. Too much honor cannot be awarded them for their most effective services here. A volume might well be devoted to these women for their share in the work of development in this new country. They endured many of the hardships described in this work of achievement and struggle. They followed their husbands and sweethearts into this barren country even before the success of the reclamation operations was assured. They lent not only encouragement but actual and most effective assistance to the men from the very first. And it has been well said that but for these devoted women the reclamation of this Colorado Desert might have been possible, but it would not have been a fact. Among these early pioneers was Mrs. Le Roy Holt. Mr. Holt, who later became president of several banks in the Valley, came to Imperial early in 1901. In June of that year Mrs. Holt followed her husband. She arrived at Flowing Wells Station on the Southern Pacific, expecting to settle in the Valley. Being the only woman in the stage-coach, she was accorded a seat beside the driver, some ten feet in the air. Reaching the Salton Sea, they found barrels of water left by the freighters, there being not a drop on the entire road between the station and Imperial. A lone mesquite tree, called the \"15-mile tree,\" was there used as a mail-peg upon which to hang the mail sack for the Bothwell Camp on the east side. And yet there is no record showing that this mail was ever robbed. It was an all-day trip, the horses were well-nigh exhausted, and the destination was not reached until five o'clock. The only men in sight on their arrival were Mr. Holt and Mr. Reid, the editor of the Imperial Press, which was the first newspaper issued in the Valley. Of course the newspaper man is always among the pioneers in every bold undertaking or project of this nature. He never gets left. And this was the inspiration which animated his local paper. Water was king and here was its kingdom. Three months later Mrs. Holt paid her second visit to Imperial. This time she came to stay and has been there ever since. The only hotel was of canvas, and there was a little church, a printing-office building, one store-room, and a little 10 x 12 office for the Imperial Land Company. A Chinaman at the hotel was the manager, and there was no landlord. The only other woman in sight had just arrived by the stage. She took up some land and moved out at once. Thus the only women in Imperial and for miles around were the wife of the editor, Mrs. Frost and Mrs. Holt. There was then no wire communication with the outside world, and the mail was often many hours behind time. The people occasionally became hungry and found difficulty in keeping warm, as the stovepipe would blow away, when a neighbor would give chase on the Holt pony, fearing it might land in the canal and be lost forever. Mrs. Holt recalls one Sunday when they got no meal at all day, the dust being so thick they could not eat in the tent-house. The children were kept in bed in case the tent was blown over.\n\nOn being asked why they stayed in a place like that she answered with much enthusiasm, \"Because we loved the days that were not windy and dusty, and we loved also the bigness of our surroundings. We never felt lonely nor homesick here; even the stars seemed nearer to us.\"\n\nThe Rev. John C. Hay was the pastor of the little Imperial church, which had only six persons in its congregation at this first service and three scholars in the Sunday school. In the evening the hotel Chinaman took part and sang \"Onward, Christian Soldiers\" with great effect. Ruth Reid, the editor's baby, was the first child born there, and Jesse and Tom Holt were the first children who lived in Imperial. Many other eloquent hardships endured by this noble pioneer woman might be cited if space permitted.\n\nEditor Reid, who guided the destinies of the Press from May until October 1901, gave a graphic picture of the Imperial city in the preceding March before the little printing shop was built, during the progress of which the paper was being put in type and made ready for the press. A roster of the place at that time showed a population of one dozen.\n\nIn those days the people depended entirely upon the \"freighter,\" with his long string of mules, for everything which had to be brought in from the outside. And this freighter was a picturesque character, affording much amusement to the residents. But of course the method of transportation was excessively slow, costly and unsatisfactory. And yet the people were glad to get even this service. They were not then in any position to contrast it with better things. And the fact is, after all, that we enjoy almost everything in this world by contrast.\n\nThe irrigation water only began to enter the Valley in the summer of 1901, and then by a very small stream. And yet the editor of the Press, which had just begun its career, became so enthusiastic over the event that he used all the big type in stock, and then concluded with this paragraph: \"Imagine how pleasant to the eye the green fields, surrounded by a barren waste, will be to the eye.\" But everybody was ready to overlook his faulty construction in view of his unbounded enthusiasm. Several crops of sorghum, maze, wheat and barley were raised that very summer, however, in the region of Cameron and Blue Lake.\n\nExperiments were also made with cantaloupes and Egyptian cotton, with such surprising results that the government began to doubt the reports of their own officials. It was apparent that the only requisite was water.\n\nThe Imperial Post office was opened in May, and the first public school, under Prof. Carr, from Nevada City, was started. The next day after this school opened there were fifty pupils enrolled. Some of these walked five miles every day to reach it.\n\nThe following spring the Southern California Editorial Association took a trip through this district under the auspices of the Imperial Land Company. This gave a new impetus to the whole section which never died out. Landholders were then assured that the irrigation system under construction would be completed early in 1902. Thus extensive preparations of the soil were made for tillage.\n\nBut now came the adverse report from the government soil expert, which, though technical and almost unintelligible to the average reader, claimed in effect that because of the large percentage of alkali much of the land would prove worthless for most crops, except on some of the bottom lands below Yuma, where the conditions were different.\n\nThis, as before remarked in an earlier chapter, was a great setback for the region. Even some of the newspapers made \"stories\" about the hopeless doom of the much-lauded irrigation project in the Valley. But a few of the more intelligent and conservative editors took a more thoughtful view. One of these called the report an \"alka-lie\" document. One sententious farmer, when asked about the \"white spots\" upon his productive acres, said: \"Yes, it looks like alkali and tastes like alkali, in fact it is alkali. But on land that has raised a large family, lifted a big mortgage and paid the taxes, it is only frosting on the cake of plenty.\" He denounced the alkali expert, and said he would be in better employ prying pumpkins off these \"alkali\" plots.\n\nThus the faith of these settlers never flagged; they kept on planting and raising marvelous crops from their irrigated acres where they had them. Commercial prosperity had come to stay, only awaiting more water. And it was this personal confidence in ultimate success that animated every landholder in the Valley, and this enthusiasm spilled over to the surrounding country. The construction of additional canals went bravely on, and the people began to pour into the Valley as never before. It was, therefore, apparent that in the summer of 1902 this Imperial Valley was no longer a desert. Water was in the ditches, seeds were in the ground, and the entire region was dotted over with homes of industrious and happy people. The old desert was now crossed by an important railway line which skirted the Valley on the northeast with its rails.\n\nBut up to this time little was really known as to the great fertility of this unfailing land-enriching silt. The Orange Judd Farmer, however, predicted even then that this land in ten years would sell for $600 an acre. The Valley being strictly agricultural territory, in addition to favorable climatic conditions, must have the other requisites of soil fertility and irrigation. The government ''soil report\" gave five kinds of soil â dune-sand, sand, sandy-loam and clay. This sand, they said, had blown into the desert from the old beaches on the west and northwest, and was caught upon obstructions of various kinds, and held there, gradually accumulating into sand drifts, dunes and hummocks, and this, mixed with the former soil, made a good arable combination. The sandy loam was formed by the coarser sediment of the Colorado River deposits. Underlying this sediment is a clay strata or subsoil which carries considerable organic matter with an abundance of nitrogen and potash. This clay subsoil is found all through the Valley. And this, too, is a product of the Colorado River deposits, though of a finer grade, being heavy, sticky and plastic like that of the Mississippi River delta. As a matter of fact less than one per cent of all the land in this basin has really proven worthless for high cultivation. On the contrary, its fertility exceeds what the most sanguine had hoped for, and it continues to improve in productive capacity year after year, bringing crops of great luxuriance. There is excellent drainage because of the uniform slope of the land. The fountain heads of the Colorado being in the Rocky Mountains, causes a stronger flow in summer from the melting snow, and the Gila and Salt rivers are at flood during January and February, when the Colorado is low.\n\nThe next important factor in the productive value of this or any other land is a good market. This has been found mainly at Los Angeles, 200 miles away, with its population of 600,000. Here for the past fifteen\n\nyears the demand has exceeded the supply. In addition to this the completion of the Panama Canal opens up another branch of the market. In the transportation of these Valley products the important railway line, with its vast capital and large facilities, having every interest in the rapid development of the region, is of course an all-important factor in itself. The cost of living, which for the first few years was large, has now been greatly lessened, the heavy freight rates having been offset by the cheap dairy products, eggs, poultry, and increased vegetable supplies.\n\nThe completion of the Southern Pacific branch from Imperial to Calexico in 1904 proved of great advantage. During part of this time, however, progress continued to be impeded by an insufficient supply of water, although as an association of settlers the supply was freely given, except the annual assessment on water-stock. But of course this did not help out the inadequate supply furnished, which seems to have been due, as usual, to the lack of money on the part of the irrigating contractors to cure certain defects in construction of the Hanlon head-gate, but primarily perhaps to the adverse report of the government department of agriculture as to the quality of the soil. The reclamation service of the government had also raised the question whether there was any right to use this Colorado water. All these things had an adverse influence upon capitalists at the time, who again began to lose confidence in the project. But large destinies that are decreed for success are rarely turned aside by small obstacles.\n\nNew discoveries were made at the Chaffey gate, and some other improvements effected which remedied the trouble for a time. An opening was finally made in the mud-banks of the river four miles below the Hanlon gate into Mexican territory, and this, connected the river directly with the Alamo tunnel. This was done in October 1904, and the clouds of trouble which had threatened so long dispersed at once. This Colorado River flowed along the rim of the Valley, and from 25 to 200 feet above it. And when the irrigation cut was made it was through 1,600 feet of mud-flats such as the river had been forming for centuries. Thus to carry this depression below sea level was in defiance of natural conditions, and there was some question whether the stream would take kindly to the change, or perhaps make a new channel for itself.\n\nThe opposition to the diversion of this river water for irrigation purposes was bitterly fought by Mr. A. H. Heber through influential friends in Congress at that time. He sought to convince that body of legislators that the Colorado was more useful for irrigation than for navigation purposes. But Congress would not agree to that proposition then. Then he went promptly to President Diaz of Mexico and entered into a contract with him in June 1904, for the development of an irrigation project on the basis of the use of one-half of the water of the canal, if so much was needed, being used on Mexican soil. Engineer Rockwood was placed in charge of this new project. But in February 1905, before this could be completed, the Colorado got on the rampage with successive floods, the mud-dam at intake No. 3 was swept away, and the dike was carried in the channel down into the Valley. Then various devices were planned and resorted to, but the old stream refused to be conciliated during that whole summer, and there were no available funds in the treasury of the development company. Meanwhile the great river, roaring with wrath, cut deeper and deeper into the soft mud-wall between it and the men who were making frantic efforts to curb it. Piles were sucked out, the island became flooded, and the water lapped the base of the government levees on the Arizona banks while the engineers looked calmly on. Finally, on August 9 of that year, the stream turned its bed and began pouring into the Valley toward the old lake, from which it had been shut off for ages.\n\nAbout this time, however, the Southern Pacific Company secured control of the California Development Company, and took charge, placing the matter under the direction of Engineer Rockwood, who then introduced his gate plan, which, however, was subsequently greatly changed. But then another great flood in this erratic and defiant river came down in November of that year. And now the settlers began to despair of the human agencies employed to control these vast forces of Nature, as well they might. Rockwood's gate-plan was again resorted to and finally completed in April 1906, at a cost of $130,000. The mad river had risen from 6,000 to 102,000 second feet in three days, and the impotency of man was again apparent. But something had to be done.\n\nThen the big railway corporation got busy and ordered this break closed at once at whatever cost. Various gates were built and performed wonders. It is, however, manifestly impossible to follow in detail all these successive floods and the methods used to control them from this time forward. But, strange to say, in spite of all these troubles there was still much industrial prosperity in this Valley. And yet there was much misgiving and some, becoming desperate, sold out and moved away. But a large majority of these indomitable settlers stuck to the enterprise through everything, feeling sure that the great river would be fully controlled ultimately. Meanwhile, however, exaggerated and absurd reports were being published in outside papers and magazines. Even the Los Angeles Examiner contained a report that an underground fissure had opened, allowing the waters of the ocean to pour in by a subterranean passage into the Salton Sea, and that the Valley might be engulfed. But these met strong refutation very soon, and the various Valley industries went steadily on as usual, with many new homes building.\n\nThe Southern Pacific was now in control and the slogan was, \"Stop that water.\" And it was stopped.\n\nJust previous to this the great San Francisco earthquake and fire had occurred. President E. H. Harriman, of the railway corporation, had authorized a large appropriation for the entire work of closing this break, although he had just arrived by special train while the ruins of San Francisco were still smoking. He placed Mr. H. T. Cory in charge of the work, and he proved the right man in the place at that time. Without following in detail all the methods used, it is sufficient to say that on November 4 all the waters of the yellow dragon were again confined to their old-time channel on their way to the Gulf of California, and the work had taken only one day over three weeks.\n\nANOTHER FLOOD\n\nBut now, in spite of the hurry to complete the dam across the break, another distressing flood broke on December 7, and in 36 hours the entire river was again pouring into the Salton Sea. Two weeks later, at the request of President Roosevelt, Mr. Harriman gave orders to again make the closure, and this was completed in February 1907. Now once more the old river went peacefully on its way to the ocean. Meanwhile the career of the California Development Company had failed to keep its promises in extending the water-system territory, not supplying the people's needs, and had been extravagant in its use of money. Its patrons had become dissatisfied, and there was some merit in their complaints. This finally culminated in an appeal to the government reclamation service to buy out the company. A proposition was made to organize a \"water users' association,\" with a fund of $12,000,000, agreeing with the government to purchase the property of the development company, place the whole matter under the management of the reclamation service, and then carry on the business of serving water in this Valley. But the plan did not work smoothly at the outset, owing to difference in opinion as to valuation. But President Heber finally offered to sell out for $3,000,000, and this offer was promptly accepted by the settlers, and congress was wired to that effect. But that body turned down the plan. Then there was more worry all through the Valley, and the development company became an object of distrust from that time forward. In the meantime Mr. Heber died at Goldfield, Nevada. But soon after this a deal was made with the railway company to close the river break for $200,000, which was given as a loan, the company being assigned a majority of the stock of the development company as security.\n\nUp to this time the men who had really done things, and made the reclamation of this desert possible, like Engineer Rockwood, who had sacrificed himself and his professional success; Mr. Chaffey, one of California's great builders; Dr. Heffernan, who lost his fortune, and President Heber, who had devoted all his heroic energies to the cause, struggling through one financial crisis after another, had merged all their interests in this great railway company.\n\nFinally in the spring of 1910 Judge Lovett, the new president of the Pacific Board of Directors, decided that the California Development Company must be disposed of at once, so far as the railway corporation was concerned. This meant, of course, that it should be sold at auction to the highest bidder. Up to 1903 these promoters had very little to do with the national government in a direct way, except filing on public land. As a matter of fact, incredible as it may seem, very little was officially known in Washington concerning this glorious enterprise. Government engineers who had visited the Valley reported that the irrigation proposed would cost $10,000,000. Thus no further action was taken at the time. But in 1903 there seemed to be new interest shown in the reclamation of public lands in the West. This resulted from the work of Theodore Roosevelt, Senator Newlands, of Nevada, and Congressman Mendell, of Wyoming. But, as before stated, as a result of the opposing influence of the reclamation service the plan was defeated. Various reasons for this antagonistic attitude were imputed. Engineer Rockwood advanced the theory that no canal from the Colorado River could be a permanent success unless a diversion dam were constructed across the river which would raise the water in order that the water might wash out the silt from the canal. This he thought was the contention of the government engineers at the time. But back of all this there seemed to be a hostile feeling among the officials of the Reclamation Service. Many attacks had been made upon the integrity of the promoters of the development company. It had been predicted that within twenty years dire calamity would befall these settlers in the Valley and that they would be drowned out, their homes and fields forming the bottom of a vast inland sea. Another consulting engineer in the service wrote in a similar vein, warning the people of the ruin impending. In this way the reclamation service showed their animosity toward this project. It was even hinted that the whole survey of 1854 had really been made in a back room of a Yuma saloon. But the discovery of some old sticks of that survey would seem to refute this implication. Be that as it may, however, congress authorized a resurvey of the district in 1902, but this was not completed until six years later, for reasons unknown. Then there were still further complications and delay in getting the matter through the general land office, as well as many technical irregularities. And yet it is believed that while in other parts of the West much government land has been stolen, it is thought that none of this land in the Imperial Valley was dishonestly acquired by those now engaged in the attempt to reclaim it from the desert. Dishonesty rarely thrives in a desert waste. But as this began to grow into a fertile garden men of more technical nature than ethical sensibilities saw rich prizes here. Through some blunders of the land office officials they found many ranches where technical errors had been made. Thus they began many contests to titles held by rightful owners. But few of these were finally sustained, though in some cases they were boldly operated by professional contestors, acting for an organization. But the courts have decided that an innocent purchaser must be protected. Concerning the relations between the United States government and the Imperial Valley, the main point pertains to the full control of this headstrong Colorado. President Roosevelt, in a special message to Congress, January 1907, said that absolute and permanent relief should be afforded these land owners in this Valley in such a way as to prevent all further trouble from this river. He said that much of this land would be worth from $500 to $1,500 per acre, with a total reaching perhaps $700,000,000, if this could be done. He asked Congress not only to return to the Southern Pacific Company the amount that would be required to close the second crevasse in the dikes at the heading, but also to appropriate sufficient money that the great river might be forever restrained from its erratic wanderings. And he claimed that this could not be done by any mere private enterprise. An international commission was thereupon appointed to study the necessities of the situation. This commission was composed of one member from the United States and the other from Mexico. Subsequently President Taft also asked an appropriation from Congress to control the Colorado, with the right to carry the work into Mexico. This bill, authorizing the President to use one million dollars for that purpose, was promptly rushed through both houses. The claim of the railway corporation for $1,500,000 for this work, after hanging fire for three years, was finally allowed in 1910, though in a reduced form.\n\nMORE ABOUT THE COUNTY\n\nThe purpose has been thus far to record with some detail the chronological history of the development and early progress of the Valley. If the account has been of a rambling nature, the writer will perhaps be pardoned when it is stated that it was deemed best to follow the order observed in previous records of these facts. It will be seen, as stated in a previous chapter, that the actual formation of the county itself was not among the early features of development here. San Diego County had an extended territory. It had been organized as a county in 1850, although the town dated back to 1769. But it remained a very insignificant dot on the map for over fifty years. Of course the reclamation of this lower section, known as the Colorado Desert, was wholly undreamed of at that time and for long years afterward. It was regarded as a worthless region, like many other desert sections of the United States. No one dreamed that people could ever be induced to live amid such desolation, so far from any railway line. But with the opening of the Imperial Valley a wholly different situation presented itself. The intervening distance and lack of transportation was sorely felt by the settlers. They were nearly 300 miles from the county seat, where all public business had to be"
