In partnership with CARAS, NMC collects and exhibits the Canadian Music Hall of Fame Collection, including a display of plaques with winners’ names.\n\nVisit Website\n\nCanadian Country Music Hall of Fame\n\nLevel 4\n\nIn 2009, NMC acquired an extensive collection of country music memorabilia from Canadian Country Music Hall of Fame founder Gary Buck’s estate. Since then, Studio Bell has become the official home of the Canadian Country Music Hall of Fame.\n\nIn partnership with the Canadian Country Music Association (CCMA), NMC collects and exhibits artifacts and memorabilia associated with Canadian country music and inductees to the Canadian Country Music Hall of Fame.\n\nVisit Website\n\nCanadian Songwriters Hall of Fame\n\nLevel 4\n\nThe Canadian Songwriters Hall of Fame (CSHF) is a national, bilingual, non-profit organization with an ongoing mission to honour and celebrate Canadian songwriters. As Canada’s only Hall of Fame for songwriting, the CSHF works diligently to raise awareness of the incredible contributions these exceptional songwriters have made in Canada and the world.\n\nIn 2011, CSHF was acquired by the Society of Composers, Authors and Music Publishers of Canada (SOCAN), and in 2016, it found a permanent home inside Studio Bell.\n\nVisit Website\n\nADISQ Hall of Fame\n\nLevel 4\n\nFounded in 1978, l’Association québécoise de l’industrie du disque, du spectacle et de la vidéo (ADISQ) is Quebec’s music industry association. The organization promotes the development of the music industry in the province of Quebec and recognizes the achievements of Quebecois musicians. In 2020, the ADISQ Hall of Fame has moved to its permanent home inside Studio Bell as part of a partnership with NMC.\n\nVisit Website\n\nThank you to the Direction de la francophonie, de la réflexion stratégique et des affaires publiques canadiennes for their support of this exhibition."
