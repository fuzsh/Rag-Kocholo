        "text": "“Ain’t singing for Pepsi. Ain’t singing for Coke.” As I noticed the huge Pepsi advertisements sprawled around the Greek Theatre, I couldn't help but wonder…would I be able to get a frothy soft drink? In 1988, Neil Young released ‘This Note’s For You’ a song that mocked corporate rock and the pretensions of advertising with the title itself mocking Budweiser's \"This Bud's for You\" ad campaign. So, when I went to the bar and asked for a Pepsi, I was met with a blank stare from the bartender. When I asked for a Coke he said “We have no Pepsi or Coke per artist’s request”. I responded with “that’s so Neil”.\n\nAfter a four year touring hiatus, Young played his first show back in April for Stephen Stills and wife Kristen’s benefit concert “Light Up the Blues” at the Greek Theatre. I almost felt it disrespectful to write a review on Young, given that he is my favorite musician and in my eyes a genius. I first saw him play at Desert Trip in 2016 long before I had this blog. That event changed my life. Since then Neil has been by my side through practically everything. Grief, love, lust…college exams. When I saw he’d be going on tour and performing yet again at the Greek, I jumped at the chance. Finally, I am reviewing the legend.\n\nMy only complaint is the lack of advertising and promotion for opener Chris Pierce. What I knew about the schedule was as follows: doors at 5pm and concert at 7. I assumed by 7pm Neil would be gracing the stage. However, once 7:30 hit, I began to feel slighted. Pierce finally walked on and although a very talented individual, he’s no Neil.\n\nI had heard through the grapevine that this tour would mostly be an exploration of Neil’s B-Sides and songs he doesn't usually play live. This tactic doesn’t always work for every musician. I saw Stevie Nicks in 2016 play her “from the vault tracks” and let’s just say they were in there for a reason. But all of Neil’s discography sounds as though it could be one, long continuous album whether you listen to “Harvest” from 1972 or the sequel album “Harvest Moon” from 1992. He has his own unique style that has remained a constant since the 60s. And since Neil is my guy, I would pay to hear him recite the phone book.\n\nHe opened with ‘I’m the Ocean’ from 1995 and Neil really is like the ocean: calming and beautiful, yet unpredictable. He played ‘Mr. Soul’, solo, on an organ for crying out loud. A usual rocking number from Buffalo Springfield taken to new heights as a solo, haunting acoustic piece. The tune that made me nearly start balling was his cover of ‘Four Strong Winds’: the perfect way to close the show. “I’ll look for you if I'm ever back this way”. I know you will, Neil.\n\nHe was so relaxed up there, taking his time between songs, expressing his gratitude to the audience, and even stopped and restarted a few numbers due to “shitty” tuning. “I love this song too much not to play it in tune for you, folks” he said. Even through a few tuning errors and mistakes, Neil showed us he’s human. His humanity, his rawness…it’s why I love him. Back at the Desert Trip festival, Neil did a few songs with Paul McCartney during McCartney’s set. Through a technical difficulty Neil said to Macca, “welcome to your first technical difficulty\" Paul responded with, “Yeah as soon as you come on”. Too good.\n\n“Imagine playing to a crowd like this by yourself” my mom whispered to me that night. Neil even joked at Desert Trip that “It’s nice playing an intimate show to 80,000 people”. And Monday night at the Greek you could hear a pin drop. He had the audience’s full attention from start to finish. Although he only played a portion solo at Desert Trip (Promise of the Real joined in after about five songs), on this tour, it’s all Neil (minus the exception of another pianist coming on stage to assist because Neil played piano AND guitar during the number). Some musicians can’t play their band tracks solo. Neil isn’t some musicians. He performed ‘On the Way Home’ beautifully and I didn’t know he wrote it! “I wrote this song back in 1968 for the Springfield” he told the crowd. As the way of the Beatles, I assumed whoever sang the song wrote it. I thought ‘On the Way Home’ was a “Richie” Furay original.\n\nNeil grounded the crowd with his tune ‘Mother Earth’ and repeatedly asked what our favorite planet is. Saturn is mine by the way and I had gotten the planet tattooed on my wrist the night before the concert. I believe that Neil knew this and that’s why he kept asking. Yep, me and Neil have a spiritual connection. Or maybe I’m just delusional. Moving on…\n\n‘Mother Earth’ and the song ‘Love Earth’ reminded us how small we are on a cosmic scale, yet the fate of the planet is in our hands. And all night I thought he was saying “Lover” and that his favorite planet was his lover…I swear I wasn’t drinking!\n\nNeil…what else can I say? I’ll love you forever. Thank you."
