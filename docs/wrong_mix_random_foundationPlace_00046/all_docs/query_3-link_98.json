        "text": "(born 1945). As a solo performer and with his band Crazy Horse, Neil Young created an array of acoustic ballads, country rock, and hard rock that kept his career in motion since the early 1960s. An unpredictable—and constantly evolving—performer with a distinctive, high-pitched voice, Young engaged both fans and critics with his musical eclecticism.\n\nBorn on November 12, 1945, in Toronto, Ontario, Neil Young moved to Winnipeg, Manitoba, with his mother following her divorce from his father, a well-known sports journalist. Young became interested in music after receiving a ukulele from his father for Christmas. He played the banjo next before taking up the guitar. During high school Young played with local bands, and by the early 1960s he was performing, arranging, and writing material. While hanging out in local folk clubs he met Stephen Stills and Joni Mitchell. Young moved to Toronto in the mid-1960s and began giving solo performances. When a deal to record with Rick James for the Motown label fell through, Young and bassist Bruce Palmer drove to Los Angeles, California, where they combined with Stills and another mutual friend, Richie Furay, to form the band Buffalo Springfield.\n\nDuring the late 1960s Young was active in the burgeoning folk-rock and country-rock scenes in southern California. After a tumultuous experience with Buffalo Springfield—he quit, rejoined, and quit the band again—Young released his debut solo album, Neil Young (1969). Shortly thereafter he formed the band Crazy Horse, which provided backup on his album Everybody Knows This Is Nowhere (1969) and its enduring songs “Cinnamon Girl,” “Down by the River,” and “Cowgirl in the Sand.” Young was subsequently invited to join Crosby, Stills and Nash, and the band briefly became Crosby, Stills, Nash and Young. After playing together at the Woodstock rock festival, the quartet released Déjà Vu (1970) and the live album Four Way Street (1971). Personality clashes within the group led to Young’s departure and return to his solo career.\n\nYoung was prolific during the 1970s, releasing more than a dozen albums, including two of his greatest commercial and artistic successes, After the Gold Rush (1970), featuring the song “Only Love Can Break Your Heart,” and Harvest (1972), featuring the number-one hit “Heart of Gold.” On the bleak yet acclaimed album Tonight’s the Night (1975), Young reflected on the deaths in 1972 and 1973 of Danny Whitten, a member of Crazy Horse, and Crosby, Stills, and Nash roadie Bruce Berry. The album Long May You Run (1976), recorded with Stephen Stills, earned gold-record status. In 1978 Young embarked on an arena tour, during which he previewed songs that later appeared on the hit album Rust Never Sleeps and the follow-up live recording, Live Rust (both 1979).\n\nDuring the 1980s Young’s fan support waned as his musical experimentation reached new heights. For Trans (1982), Young filtered his voice through a computerized vocoder. Later he explained that the album, like much of his work in the 1980s, reflected the frustration he felt in trying to communicate with his second son, Ben, who was born in 1978 with cerebral palsy. In 1986 Young and his wife, Pegi, founded the Bridge School, a learning center for handicapped children, in San Francisco, California. His other musical departures included rockabilly on the album Everybody’s Rockin (1983) and rhythm and blues on the album This Note’s for You (1987). Young reunited with his former Crosby, Stills and Nash bandmates for a Greenpeace benefit in 1987 and an album, American Dream (1988), which he followed up with a successful solo comeback album, Freedom (1989).\n\nRediscovered by a new generation in the 1990s, Young became a hero among young, post-punk musicians who appreciated his sound and uncompromising musical persona. He reassembled Crazy Horse and recorded the critically acclaimed album Ragged Glory (1990). In addition, he released the acoustic Harvest Moon (1992), a sequel to Harvest; wrote the Oscar-nominated title song for the film Philadelphia (1994); released the album Sleeps with Angels (1994) in remembrance of Kurt Cobain, the late lead singer of the band Nirvana; and collaborated with the band Pearl Jam on the album Mirror Ball (1995). Year of the Horse (1997), a documentary by director Jim Jarmusch, chronicled Young’s 1996 tour with Crazy Horse.\n\nIn 2001 Young responded to the September 11 attacks with “Let’s Roll,” a song honoring passengers’ efforts to foil the hijacking of one of the planes used in the terrorist attack. In 2006, on the album Living with War, he voiced his angry opposition to the Iraq War and to President George W. Bush’s handling of it. The album was performed on a tour with Crosby, Stills and Nash that was captured in the film Déjà Vu (2008; directed by Young under his filmmaking pseudonym, Bernard Shakey). Earlier, in 2003, Young had written and directed another film, Greendale, a family saga with a strong environmentalist element that was based on his album of the same name.\n\nHeart of Gold (2005) was the first of several feature-length documentaries about Young directed by Jonathan Demme. It captured a pair of emotional performances in Nashville, Tennessee, that came in the wake of Young’s brush with death caused by a brain aneurysm and that drew on his reflective, deeply autobiographical album Prairie Wind (2005). Young collected his first Grammy Award in 2010, in the unlikely category of best art direction for a boxed set, for his 2009 rarities collection Neil Young Archives Vol. 1 (1963–1972). The following year he won his first Grammy Award for music, when he was awarded best rock song for “Angry World,” a track from his 2010 album Le Noise. Young teamed again with Crazy Horse to record Americana (2012), a collection of ragged covers of traditional American folk songs.\n\nYoung was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1995. In 2012 he published the autobiography Waging Heavy Peace."
