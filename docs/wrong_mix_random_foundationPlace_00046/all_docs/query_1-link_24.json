        "text": "Workshops, readings and performances are open to the public and ran under the discretion of Nikolai Beope. The primary goal of the workshop is to create a space that allows local residents to express themselves in new ways, nurture cross-cultural exchange, as well as highlight the need for literary and performance arts in the Imperial Valley.\n\nContact info: nbeope@gmail.com\n\nOn Friday the 17th at 8PM, novelist and fellow UCSD MFA aluminati Kiik Araki-Kawaguchi will be offering a free online writing workshop for those interested. Kiik was interested in running through some generative writing exercises for people “who feel they don’t really have much time to write.” The workshop is free and will take place online through Zoom which can easily be accessed through your phone or any computer. If you are interested please contact me at nbeope@gmail and I will give you the link.\n\nKiik was originally going to read at the workshop in El Centro in May, but due to Covid19 it couldnt happen. I’m super thankful for Kiik agreeing to run a workshop for us, especially with all that’s been going on lately during these loca times. Kiik recently published the novel “The Book of Kane and Margaret” which you can find on his website here:http://www.kiikak.com/read/ Hope to see some familiar faces join us Friday the 17th at 8PM, where we will put pen to the paper/ text to the page/ writing on the wall/ etc. etc.\n\nKiik Araki-Kawaguchi writes dreampop speculative fictions and darkwave minimalist poetry that can be enjoyed on a bus ride or in line for coffee. All his best stories have something to do with talking insects. His best poems are X-Men fan fiction. He is the author of THE BOOK OF KANE AND MARGARET (FC2) and DISINTEGRATION MADE PLAIN AND EASY (1913 Press). You can find him at kiikak.com."
