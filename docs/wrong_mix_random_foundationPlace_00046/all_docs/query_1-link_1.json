        "text": "\"One of few works that fulfills its promise to tell a desire-based narrative of 'transnational migrant solidarity' without losing the analytical power necessary to confront immigrant incarceration in the US. . . . This short book packs a powerful punch . . . [and] explains the rise of the immigrant punishment system without attributing a complex issue solely to race, capitalism, or xenophobia.\"—\"Antipode\n\n\"Ordaz deftly shows the extent to which detention, control, and violence have come to dominate America’s response to undocumented immigration through a history of one of America’s oldest detention facilities.\"—Boom California\n\n\"Illuminating.\"—NACLA Report\n\n\"A compelling work that exposes the hidden histories of El Centro and detention centers more generally . . . a nuanced approach to current scholarship by analyzing the long and continuous histories of violence that have been prevalent in these detention centers from their inception, and not necessarily as a more recent product of neoliberal practices and policies.\"—Society for U.S. Intellectual History\n\n\"Jessica Ordaz excavates unknown and forgotten histories, documenting the violence embedded within the immigration enforcement and detention system as well as the remarkable way migrants resisted their confinement through escape, hunger strikes, and solidarity movements.\"--Amada Armenta, University of California, Los Angeles\n\n\"This compelling book interrogates the intimate and transnational configuration and implications of U.S. domestic detention centers and practices as an economy of underestimated emotional hauntings, protest, and trauma.\"--Ana Elizabeth Rosas, University of California, Irvine"
