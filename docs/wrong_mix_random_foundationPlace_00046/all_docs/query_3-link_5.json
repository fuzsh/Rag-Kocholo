        "text": "Neil Young's new book, Waging Heavy Peace, isn't a traditional rock memoir. Written throughout 2011, it addresses everything from the recent Crazy Horse reunion back to the formation of Buffalo Springfield – but it's presented in a completely non-linear way. Young also stops the narrative from time to time to complain about the audio quality of MP3s and go into detail about his ongoing electric car project. The end result is a glimpse right into Young's brain. It also contains tons of unseen personal photographs. Here are some of the more interesting ones.\n\nBy Andy Greene"
