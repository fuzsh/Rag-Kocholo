        "text": "It shows the band's 'raw' music making process\n\nNeil Young and his long-time band Crazy Horse released their latest album 'Barn' on 10th December 2021, and fans can now watch a documentary which captures the behind the scenes of creating the album.\n\nThe music on the new album is different to the 13 albums the band have previously released together, which Neil explained: 'These are new times, with new songs and feelings after what our world has been through and continues to face. The music we are making for our souls. It’s like fresh water on a desert. Life is going on.'\n\nThe documentary following the making of the album is also called Barn, and was directed by actress and director Daryl Hannah. Footage was captured as the band worked on the album together in the summer of 2021, in their current practice space - a 19th century log barn.\n\nThe press release for the documentary describes it saying: 'It captures Neil and the Horse in an organic way, their easy irreverent humour, their brotherhood, and of course their music, as it was created.'\n\nBetween clips of the band rehearsing together and making decisions about the music they're creating, there are relaxing video clips showing scenes from around the barn - which located on Neil's California ranch - with views of a lake, mountains and open green spaces.\n\nThe film description also explains: 'Barn intentionally lingers on single shots for entire songs, showing there are no tricks, revealing the raw, organic and spontaneous process of the music bursting to life from unexpected moments. The film is infused with the gratitude and joy that permeated the whole experience.'\n\nThe documentary was released on YouTube on 20th January, you can watch it below.\n\nWatch Neil Young and Crazy Horse's Barn documentary:\n\nTake a look at these incredible artists then and now:\n\nNeil has recently been communicating with fans through a website called Neil Young Archives, where he shares news, updates and older songs from his own archive. On 29th December, Neil shared a previously unreleased album called 'Summer Songs' which features eight songs recorded in 1987.\n\nNow Read:\n\nSimple Minds release reimagined version of early track 'Act Of Love'\n\nBruce Springsteen takes top spot in 2021's Top 10 highest paid musicians\n\nDavid Bowie named as best selling vinyl artist of 21st century\n\nHow to listen to Greatest Hits Radio:\n\nListen to Greatest Hits Radio on the free Rayo app, online or on your DAB digital radio.
