        "text": "Neil Young's first memoir, Waging Heavy Peace, meanders in a way his fans will appreciate.\n\n(Photo by Penguin Group)\n\nIf you plan to read Waging Heavy Peace: A Hippie's Dream (Blue Rider Press), the first memoir by legendary rocker Neil Young, it would be a good thing if you were already a fan of his.\n\nThat’s not to say that the book isn’t enjoyable, or well-written, or deeply engaging and even humorous. But Young is a famously capricious, occasionally cryptic figure who is well-known to keep his own counsel, and like all things he does, he has written his book exactly his way. If you like his way, then, you will most likely like it.\n\nWaging Heavy Peace hops through time according to Young's whim, which can be very whimsical indeed. In his writing, he returns to Canada in the '60's, and his vivid memories of touring with his first band, the Squires. He recalls his California run-ins with the Manson Family, via Beach Boy Dennis Wilson, as well as being diagnosed with polio at age 6, in 1951. He dips into the early days with the Buffalo Springfield and the Mynah Birds, his mid-60's band with Rick James. Young touches on his friendship with Stephen Stills, and remembers writing \"The Old Laughing Lady\" on a napkin in a White Castle; he also zips into the '80's to talk about founding The Bridge School, the school for disabled children run by his wife, and the 2000's, when emergency surgery forced him to cancel hosting Canada's prestigious music awards, the Junos. And then we go back 40 years to remember the scent of Los Angeles air, the first time he smelled it.\n\nIn the text, Young often breaks the fourth wall to remark, lightheartedly, on the novelty of writing a book. A broken toe and the choice to be completely sober for the first time in many years prompted the project, which interests him as a thing in itself as much as the introspection and reminiscing required to write it.\n\nWe spend a lot of dear-diary time with him as he writes, and shares what's going on with him in the moment. He's looking for funding for Pono, the high-quality audio player he's developed; he's also wondering whether he can write songs sober, and if Crazy Horse, with whom he hasn't worked in a decade, will work on new songs with him. (He can, and they did; \"Psychedelic Pill,\" a double album with Crazy Horse, comes out Oct. 30.) To record with Crazy Horse, he writes, he'd like to use an old tube console, and record 8-track to tape. \"I think that this will be fun and will work,\" he notes, as if in a quick email. \"I'll keep you posted.\"\n\nThere’s no authorial distance or writerly technique, just 500 pages of Neil Young’s brain, straight to the page. When he brings the laptop from the house out to the shed, we know.\n\n\"I'm even considering starting a second book titled Cars and Dogs,\" he writes, \"because there is so much more to say than I could ever say in one book.\"\n\nOne thing the book reveals, to a great extent, is how much of an inveterate tinkerer Young is. His listeners know the guitarist is a gearhead, dedicated to sonic risk-taking and innovation with his music and exacting in his requirements for sound quality (Pono, he hopes, will provide listeners with an alternative to the low-quality, compressed sound of mp3s and deliver a product more akin to what musicians hear in the studio.) Young is also interested in model trains, boats, filmmaking, cars and carpentry, and goes into extensive, multi-page detail about each hobby, from the history of the Lionel train company to the reclaimed redwood panels he used to renovate his home.\n\nTaken on their own, these long meditations are of little interest to anyone who doesn’t share his interest in, say, modifying vintage cars to run on electricity and ethanol. Together, though, they make up a rather fascinating look at how his curious and methodical brain works. There’s not a ton of explicitly explored emotion in the book, but there is a great deal of noting how things work, or if they do or don’t, and that applies to human relationships, band dynamics and his own body, apparently, as much as trains, guitars and cars.\n\nThat’s not to say he’s an automaton. His love for his children, his wife of nearly 40 years, his parents and his longtime musical collaborators is clear, and touching to read about – he just writes things like “Pegi is my life partner” as briefly and matter-of-factly as he writes “Old Black (his 1952 Gibson Les Paul) is my guitar.”\n\nSeveral reviews of Waging Heavy Peace have referenced Bob Dylan's 2004 memoir Chronicles Vol 1 as an analogue to Young's book. Young has written his share of obtuse lyrics, but by and large, he's always been far more accessible than Dylan, at least word-wise (musically, of course, is another story.) The plainspoken Waging Heavy Peace is not really that similar, stylistically, to the impressionistic yarn-spinning of Chronicles. But both books are non-chronological in nature, and both men are grand old lions in winter, whose careers have invited tremendous amounts of fascination and speculation. The life and work of each has been thoroughly investigated by scholars and biographers (Young actually makes reference to Shakey, Jimmy McDonough's thorough 2003 biography of him, in Waging Heavy Peace).\n\nThe important thing to remember for a from-the-horse's mouth work like Chronicles or Waging Heavy Peace, is that it is not one of those exhaustive, meticulous investigations. The body of work is the lifetime of music, and the memoir is an annotation. Read with that understanding, Waging Heavy Peace is a satisfying read for the true fan.\n\nNeil Young plays the 2012 Voodoo Experience at 9 p.m., Friday, Oct. 26, on the Le Ritual stage.\n\nAlison Fensterstock writes about music and popular culture for NOLA.com and The Times-Picayune.
