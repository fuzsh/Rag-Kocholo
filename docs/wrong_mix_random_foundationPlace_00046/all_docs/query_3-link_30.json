        "text": "My new book To Feel the Music, co-written with Phil Baker, has been announced and is now available for preorder on numerous book sites. To Feel the Music is the story of my efforts to improve the quality of audio that you hear. It takes you through how the sound was and is compromised by the tech and record companies, and instead of improving over time like other technologies, it has become worse.\n\nOur book also tells the business and development story behind Pono, and then, when people wanted the convenience of streaming, how we developed Xstream high resolution streaming, the highest quality streaming in the world, as you hear it at NYA. The issue of improving audio quality has been one of the most important things we’ve been doing for decades, and something I focus on every day. We spent a year writing this and I think you’ll find it interesting and informative. The book will be released September 9 and I hope you enjoy it."
