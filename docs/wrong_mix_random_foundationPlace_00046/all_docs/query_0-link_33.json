        "text": "I happened to come across this podcast recently, and I am so very grateful I did. I am home on maternity leave, and Iâm glad I have found something to keep my mind engaged while tending a newborn and house that isnât mindless television or phone scrolling. The stories are thought provoking and well written, Levarâs reading of the stories is engaging and the music is a perfect accompaniment to really get you immersed in the tale. In fact, this podcast has reignited my creativity and has inspired me to start writing again very soon (I have some ideas buzzing around). I also have gotten my husband hooked and he listens before bed every night. A short story Iâd love to hear you read is âHere Be Dragonsâ by Laurell K Hamilton. Thank you for this brilliant podcast and I canât wait for the next season.\n\nNow, that I know where the end is, I am afraid to listen too fast. This is the first podcast that I feel better about myself after listeningâ¦like Iâve done something edifying by tuning in. Levar Burton is a genuine source of good in this world."
