        "text": "Legendary singer-songwriter, musician and activist Neil Young brings one of his most personal albums, GREENDALE, to comics. Overseeing the work of acclaimed writer Joshua Dysart (UNKNOWN SOLDIER) and fan-favorite artist Cliff Chiang (HUMAN TARGET), they compose a graphic novel that explores a whole new dimension to the album that Rolling Stone voted as one of the best of its year.In the Fall of 2003, as the nation gallops into war, a politically active teenage girl named Sun lives, loves and dreams in a small California town named Greendale.Sun's always been different. There's been talk that the women in her family have all had a preternatural communion with nature. And when a Stranger comes to town – a character whose presence causes Greendale to, well, go to hell – she'll find herself on a journey both mystical and mythical. To face the Stranger, she'll unearth the secrets of her family in a political coming-of-age story infused with its own special magic.\n\nTalent\n\nWritten by:\n\nJoshua Dysart\n\nArt by:\n\nCliff Chiang\n\nSean Murphy\n\nColorist:\n\nCliff Chiang\n\nDave Stewart\n\nLetterer:\n\nTodd Klein\n\nSPECS\n\nU.S. Price:\n\n19.99\n\nOn Sale Date:\n\nWednesday, June 9th, 2010\n\nPage Count:\n\n160\n\nDC COMICS NEWS & FEATURES\n\nDC Deep Dive\n\n“Dark Knights of Steel: Allwinter” Explores a World Without Color or Warmth\n\nDC House of List-ery\n\nSix Comics to Read if You Love \"My Adventures with Superman\"\n\nSuper Here For...\n\nMaster of the House: Lex Luthor’s Sacrifice and Salvation\n\nPress Release\n\nDC Announces 'Batman and Robin: Year One' by Waid and Samnee\n\nAbsolute Power\n\n“Absolute Power #1” is an Emotional Shot of Adrenaline\n\nWeekend Escape\n\n\"Hellblazer: Rise and Fall\" is Your First Step on the Road to Hell\n\nDC Spotlight\n\nThe Prodigal Bird is Anything but Ordinary\n\nPress Release\n\nDC Announces Expanded SDCC Presence and Lineup With New Booth on Show Floor\n\nDC House of List-ery\n\nTask Master: Five of Amanda Waller’s Most Hardcore Moments\n\nDC Spotlight\n\nGodzilla and Kong Have Disrupted the DC Universe—and That’s a Good Thing!\n\nAsk...the Question\n\nHow Many Metal Men Are There?\n\nBatman Full Moon Announcement\n\nBatman: Full Moon – Eisner Nominee Rodney Barnes Makes His DC Black Label Series Debut with The Riddler: Year One Artist Stevan Subic\n\nDC Spotlight\n\nShadows of the Past Chase Zatanna in “Bring Down the House”\n\nWeekend Escape\n\n\"Bad Dream: A Dreamer Story\" Showcases What DC Does Best\n\nDC House of List-ery\n\nSix With Style: Celebrating DC’s Queer Fashion Icons"
