        "text": "Report from the Berlin Film Festival, 2002\n\nFollow the terrain: the first words spoken in Berlinale 2002s opening film, Tom Tykwers Heaven and, as a description of what was to unfold over the next twelve days, a more accurate guide than Accept Diversity the somewhat half-hearted motto espoused by new festival head Dieter Kosslick. Stepping in after 22 years of Moritz de Hadeln rule, Kosslick made no bones about his view that 2002 would be merely an appetizer to the main course in 2003 which may explain why he followed his predecessors terrain so closely. A very de Hadeln slate was how many summed up the 23 Golden Bear candidates and the six out of competition selections.\n\nIn other words, much Hollywood Oscar bait Beautiful Mind, Gosford Park, Monsters Ball, and Miramaxs Shipping News, Iris and Tenenbaums accompanied by photogenic stars guaranteed to snare newspaper front pages. The glitz has historical justification, given that the event was set up by Hollywood to boost the citys cultural life in the bleak post-war days but real substance is needed if Berlin is to remain one of the worlds most important festivals. By general consent 2002 came up short, the competition in particular: worst in 10 years, at least according to one Berlinale regular.\n\nOf the four German entries, Andreas Dresens Halbe Treppe was the most liked, an accessibly comic-dramatic look at the marital ups and downs of two couples in their late thirties. But Dresen follows the Mike Leigh terrain rather too closely: all very Life Is Sweet, right down to having a Tim Spall lookalike (Axel Prahl) struggling to make a living in the catering trade. Considering it was constructed, Leigh-style, from cast improvisations, the script ploughs an established furrow reasonably well. But there’s nothing new or necessarily cinematic going on here: likewise, there’s no especially good reason for it to be shot on DV, or to be a film at all. (Similar doubts afflict Annette Olesens Minor Mishaps, another popular, well-observed but fundamentally over-familiar examination of urban family life that suggests, after Mifune and Italian For Beginners, the Danes need to ditch their Berlin formula.)\n\nIronically enough, while Dresen and Olesen use DV for very un-cinematic ends, Dominik Grafs Corsica-set Der Felsen (A Map of the Heart), while initially intended for television, engages the new mediums possibilities – with some spectacular results. The DV decision was apparently taken at the last minute, while Graf and his co-writer laboured on the screenplay for years – youd be forgiven for thinking the opposite was the case, such is the contrast between the exhilarating style Graf uses tells his story, and the rickety nature of the tale itself, in which a mid-thirties Grace Kelly lookalike (Karoline Eichhorn) embarks on an ill-advised holiday romance with a charismatic tearaway (Antonio Wannek) half her age.\n\nFor all its faults, Der Felsen at least tried to find new terrain in terms of sheer directorial flair, Graf put most of his fellow competitors to shame. It was galling to see him get a mauling from press and public alike though his reception looked positively glowing alongside the last German entry, Christopher Roths Baader, which was compared to Attack of the Killer Tomatoes by one local kritik.\n\nBaaders advance word was so rotten, however, that many critics decided to give it a miss by the second week, wed endured sufficient sub-standard competition movies that many risked missing important but reportedly stodgy titles like Amen, Laissez-Passer and Taking Sides, to catch unheralded fare in the Forum and Panorama sidebars: rewards included the cracking French thriller Sur Mes Levres Toni Collette and Vincent Gallo for the Hollywood remake, sil-te-plait. Even Market screenings for which invitations had to be begged from distributors proved increasingly popular, especially Kim Tae-Gyuns literally too-cool-for-school Harry Potter/Matrix/Battle Royale hybrid Volcano High, an entertaining if wildly overlong blast of genre-bending exotica.\n\nThe sidebars counterbalanced the uneven German showing among competition entrants (a charitable view of Heaven would be to say it wasn’t afraid to embrace absurdity as a route to profundity), with Henner Winckler and Ulrich Koehler emerging from Hamburgs Fine Arts College as names to watch. In Wincklers Klassenfahrt (School Trip) a group of 16-year-olds mope round a run-down resort on Polands Baltic coast. In theory, the last thing world cinema needs is another exploration of alienated teenagers, but what a difference it makes when every role is this well cast, written and acted, from the smallest bit part up to Steven Spirlings charismatic Ronny: equal parts class clown, maladroit loser and suffering artist-in-embryo. A sensational feat of (largely internalised) characterisation, this was probably the best performance I saw in the whole fortnight.\n\nBungalow, meanwhile, takes the zonked-out, uninflected unpredictability of Jessica Hausners Lovely Rita, then leavens it with a welcome strain of quirky humour disillusioned by the adult world, teenage Paul deserts from the army and heads home to his parents bungalow to ponder his future, Holden Caulfield style. Koehler sketches in the dog-days atmosphere of Pauls sleepy village with the experienced eye of someone glad to have escaped its stifling confines, and shows sufficient nerve to leave Pauls final fate in the mind of the beholder.\n\nBungalow was preceded in its screenings by a short from another promising Hamburg graduate: Harry Sachss Road Movie, which takes precisely one minute to tell one terrific visual joke. Length was a major issue in Berlin – at the other end of the scale from Road Movie was Tiexi District, Wang Bings 300-minute documentary chronicling the demise of heavy industry in northern China, which was reckoned to contain about two hours of strong footage.\n\nExcessive padding was a recurring problem everywhere: if only more directors dared to emulated Jan Cvitkovics terrific, 68-minute market-shown Bread and Milk. But while it was a delight to clock Bungalows lean 84 minutes and Klassenfahrts 85, too many debutants fall into the trap of over-ambition such as Ramon Salazar, whose 130-minute Piedras (Stones) somehow sneaked into competition.\n\nClumsily juggling the stories of five women (or is it six?) in the Spanish capital, Salazar blatantly aims for a kind of Madrilena Magnolia Aimee Mann style songs provided by Natalie Merchant. The results are like Paul Thomas Anderson with all the visual zap removed, leaving undeveloped characters entangled in melodramatic implausibilities. Junji Sakamotos KT, meanwhile, ran to 138 minutes of bloated self-importance this time, think Michael Mann sans flair as it dramatised the 1975 kidnap of South Koreas current Prime Minister, Kim Dae-Jung.\n\nThe more films like Piedras and KT I endured, the more convinced that The Royal Tenenbaums would follow Magnolia and The Thin Red Line down the US-auteur route to the Golden Bear. With Gosford Park running ausser Konkurrenz, the main threat seemed to be another semi-comic murder-mystery, Franocis Ozons well-received 8 Femmes.From the opening titles (in lurid pink over a shot of an ornate chandelier) it was clear Ozon intended to revel in camp-as-Christmas artifice to craft a showcase for some of his favourite actresses, including a separate song for each. First among equals: Isabelle Huppert – her number, of course, an intense piano solo.\n\n8 Femmes was enjoyable enough, but surely there must have been more to it than that or so I thought, until I saw the blank look on Ozons face when I asked him whether, given the movies late-50s setting, and the fact that it revolves around the death of Papa, perhaps he was saying something about the demise of the cinema du papa. A delectable bauble, 8 Femmes may not yield much below its delightful surface in starkk contrast to another French competitor, Iosselianis calmly magisterial Lundi Matin, which positively demands careful, repeated viewing.\n\nStartling to stumble across such an adult, confident, director who knew exactly what he wanted to say, and exactly how he wanted to say it even if that message ended up being that modern life is rubbish. Fiftysomething factory worker Vincent (producer Jacques Bidou) impulsively breaks free from his predictable 9-5 existence and heads first to Venice, then farther afield, before finally returning home. The humour is so unforced that inattentive viewers may take it all as serious drama, or even tragedy. Not that they’d necessarily be wrong almost uniquely among the Berlin movies, Lundi Matin managed to work on several different levels, apparently without breaking sweat.\n\nIosselianis Best Director prize was the least he deserved and it was arguably the only big award that made much sense. The so-so Halbe Treppe snagged the runner-up prize, and the Golden Bear was shared between Paul Greengrasss exasperatingly uneven but ultimately moving Northern Ireland verite-drama Bloody Sunday and Miyazakis animated Spirited Away, the latter having generally dismissed before the ceremony as not a patch on Princess Mononoke or fine, if youre a 12-year-old girl. But nobody could puzzle out how Best Individual Contribution could be split between all eight of Ozons women scant solace for Huppert, who had much more claim to the Best Actress prize than Monsters Balls over-indulged Halle Berry.\n\nBut these were mild injustices indeed alongside the decision to give the Premiere First Movie Award to Beneath Clouds, Ivan Sens embarrassingly badly-written, badly-directed debut that, like the similarly inept Greek entry One Day In August, featured some notably poor performances from child actors. Getting into competition was mystifying enough, but placing Sens turkey ahead of Klassenfahrt and Bungalow was beyond a joke. Not so much beneath clouds as severely under the weather.\n\nWas it the worst film I saw in Berlin? Perhaps, but Wim Wenders new music documentary Viel Passiert Der BAP Film ran it close, dire enough to convince me not only of Wenders current creative redundancy, but also that of the entire German generation for whom he presumes to speak. This was a rare disappointment among an otherwise very strong documentary slate, the biggest buzz being generated by Keith Fulton and Louis Pepes Lost In La Mancha, which follows Terry Gilliams attempts to bring Don Quixote to the screen.\n\nAs a late addition to the schedule, only one showing was originally programmed until, in an encouraging show of flexibility, an extra screening was hastily organised. Similar responsiveness enabled the Forum to arrange what was probably the festivals most important single event, the first complete showing of James Bennings California trilogy (El Valley Centro [2000] Los [2001] and the brand new Sogobi) on a single night after well-received separate showings. Los was the best film I saw last year, and Centro matched it both films are avant-garde portraits of the state (Centro examining the farmlands, Los the Greater LA County) composed of 35 static, almost-silent 2 minute shots. They confirm Benning as one of our most provocatively original film-makers today, as well as one of the most ferociously angry: Los and Centro, though seemingly about nothing, in fact teem with meaning challenging analyses of how politics and money impinge upon landscape and people.\n\nWhich made Sogobi all the more disappointing its a step backwards, away from the city and into the largely-untouched countryside. With only a couple of exceptions, Benning shows us nature in the raw, and by taking the effects of big business out of the picture he leaves a gaping hole: not so much Hamlet without the Prince, as sans Claudius, a no-less-disastrous omission. Even a Benning fan like myself found Sogobi an exercise in tedium, though Los and El Valley Centro remain stunning achievements the latter, in ambition and execution, dwarfing the other 32 films I saw in the Berlinale.\n\nAt least it was in the festival, of course regardless of Sogobis faults, the trilogy was an auspicious coup for new sidebar head Christoph Terhechte, whose predecessors Ulrich and Erika Gregor had overseen all 31 previous Forums. Crucially, Kosslick gets on well with Terhechte in fact, Kosslick seems to get on with everybody. Hes already been praised for co-ordinating the Forum and Wieland Specks Panorama with the Competition and others sidebars. This, and his irrepressible good humour, have carried him along so far but for everybodys sake, he’d better be sure that next years main course has a lot more meat on the menu than he served up here.\n\n24 th February, 2002\n\nby Neil Young"
