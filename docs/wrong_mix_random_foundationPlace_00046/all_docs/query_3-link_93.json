        "text": "Spotlight-shunning Valley Center troubadour J.J. Cale is singled out for praise as a songwriting and guitar-playing inspiration in rock legend Neil Young’s new autobiography, “Waging Heavy Peace — A Hippie Dream.”\n\nOn page 10 of his freewheeling, 497-page book, Young writes about “a few songs that mean a lot to me and may have shaped my songwriting.” The first he cites is Cale’s “Crazy Mama,” which Young ranks above classics by Bob Dylan (“Like a Rolling Stone”), The Ronettes (“Be My Baby”), Roy Orbison (“Evergreen”) and Ian & Sylvia (“Four Strong Winds”).\n\nA bluesy ballad that is a model of understatement, “Crazy Mama” is from Cale’s 1972 debut album, “Naturally.” The album’s cast of musical accompanists includes longtime Young keyboardist David Briggs, although Young makes no mention of this. But the high esteem in which he holds Cale is palpable.\n\nWrites Young: ” ‘ Crazy Mama’ by J.J. Cale is a record I love. The song is true, simple, and direct, and the the delivery is very natural. J.J.’s guitar playing is a huge influence on me, His touch is unspeakable.”\n\nCale, 73, released his 15th and most recent album, “Roll On,” in 2009. It came three years after his Grammy Award-winning album collaboration with Eric Clapton, “The Road to Escondido” (which also featured formed San Diego bassist Nathan East and North County multi-instrumental wiz Dennis Caplinger). Cale also performed on Clapton’s 2010 album, “Clapton,” which also featured Cale band keyboardist Walt Richmond.\n\nClapton scored hits in the 1970s with two of Cale’s songs, “After Midnight” and “Cocaine.” Like Young, the English guitar legend also cites Cale as a key inspiration.\n\n“I never think I’ll be as good as the people I look up to,” Clapton said in a 2004 U-T San Diego interview. “J.J. is pretty close to the ideal focus for that. I like his principles; I think he’s a very principled man.”"
