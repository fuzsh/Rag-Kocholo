It was a two hour meeting with the editorial and managerial staff (including then editor Bill Keller) of the New York Times during Winter 2009. Three academics (including myself) were asked to discuss the NYT coverage of immigration. I argued for a focus on making undocumented immigrants into three dimensional persons, contradicting the dominant image of them in the media as lawbreakers only. This priority has since been reflected in the reporting of several of their reporters, including Kirk Semple, David Gonzalez, Nina Bernstein, and Julia Preston. I believe my argument strengthened the hand of reporters at the Times who wanted to do this kind of work.\n\nSmith, R. (2011, November 25). .
