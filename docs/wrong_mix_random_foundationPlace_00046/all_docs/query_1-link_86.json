        "text": "Growing up in El Centro, Fernando Zweifach López Jr. never thought they’d end up as the executive director of San Diego Pride, an organization with a mission to create a world free of prejudice and bias.\n\nBut looking back, the trajectory makes perfect sense. Having faced prejudice and bias in their own life, López brings a wide range of lived experience and understanding to the position.\n\nThey moved to San Diego in 1999 as a homeless young person and ultimately became an LGBT community leader here, working at Equality California, Marriage Equality USA and now Pride. López has created the Pride Youth Leadership Academy, worked to expand voter outreach, and from July 10-18, will lead the organization through its fourth celebration of Pride in San Diego as executive director.\n\nLópez is this week’s guest on Name Drop San Diego. Read excerpts of the conversation below or listen to the full episode in the podcast player above or on your favorite listening apps including these:\n\nApple | Spotify | Google | Stitcher\n\nOn whether their younger self would believe they were doing this job today:\n\nAbsolutely not. I came from a small town. I came from El Centro, a rural community, very homophobic. Lots of bullying, discrimination, harassment growing up, from faculty and administrators and family and faith and friends and etc. And so when I found myself homeless, I think, you know, you don’t really see a future for yourself, right? You’re not like planning for the next thing. You don’t see what that can be. And so no, I absolutely could not see this. I’m a huge nerd. I went to school for computer graphics. I thought I was going to make special effects for “Star Wars” films. That was my big plan. Obviously, I went in a different direction. So no, I absolutely didn’t think that this was going to be my path. I very much sort of stumbled into this work in as I tried to just live my life. Trying to find employment and go to school, and get married and have children, you recognize the different legal challenges and administrative obstacles that you face being a queer person in the early 2000s. I was like, well, this is not equal. This promise of the United States that we’re supposed to be, you know, equal under the law, like that’s not my experience. So how can I change that? And so I started volunteering, and slowly but surely, like volunteering for these different organizations and educating myself online on constitutional law, on gender equity and employment discrimination and insurance discrimination. And being my own advocate is how I eventually kept getting asked by these different organizations to do more and do more and eventually ended up working for Marriage Equality USA and Equality California. And then 10 years ago was asked to come and work here at San Diego Pride. So yeah, that wasn’t the plan.\n\nOn their goal as executive director of Pride:\n\nThe overarching goal, I think, is what our vision statement is, which is, a world free of prejudice and bias. And I think it’s interesting that San Diego Pride’s vision statement doesn’t say a world free of prejudice and bias for only LGBTQ people. It is a world free of prejudice and bias. And so much of the work that we have to do must be intersectional in that. I think in doing social justice work, if you really start peeling away the layers and looking at the commonalities of what our seemingly disparate struggles are, a lot of it really boils down to White supremacy, and White supremacists’ notions of societal norms and expectations. And so whether that’s through gender roles and patriarchal constructs, or just, yeah, the way that we need to operate in society as oppressed, marginalized community members, I think so many of our communities and activists recognize those common threads of combating White supremacy. And so, you know, what do I bring personally to that? I’m a first generation U.S. citizen. I’m Jewish. I’m Mexican American. My father is a Mexican American, Vietnam War veteran, immigrant. He and his entire generation and the generation before came to this country from Mexico and worked in the fields. And so I have that sort of understanding of that cultural heritage and upbringing to be an immigrant, to be Latino, to be a field worker and working class. And then on the other side of my family, I have a Jewish mother, child of immigrants, again, from Russia and Austria, respectively, who came to this country to escape persecution and death. And so like really the compounding of their identities and experiences is then in me, as a queer, nonbinary, Latinx, Jewish, you know, first generation U.S. citizen, former homeless youth, rape survivor. I have a brother who is blind, deaf, quadriplegic and developmentally disabled. I have so much just personal connection to these disparate things, or these things that seem disparate, but they converge in my life. And so how can I not bring that lens to this work? And so what is the work? It’s all of it, right? LGBTQ folks are everything. We are every age, every gender, every religion, from every nationality, every part of the world. And so our experiences are not part of a monolith, but the spectrum of human experience. And so how can we authentically honor that and challenge the systems that not only oppress the LGBT community, but oppress all marginalized communities?\n\nWhat Pride means to them:\n\nPride to me, I guess, personally, means a lot of things. Pride, for me, is an opportunity to find connection and find family. I think, for me, as a young person growing up, you know, at a very different time, there wasn’t a lot of the LGBT nonprofits, organizations, media coverage, visibility on TV and movies. Like we didn’t have that when I was growing up. And so it’s an opportunity to be seen, and to find that connection that you maybe don’t have in your day-to-day life, with your family, faculty and school, your coworkers, you know, in your work situation or in your institutions of faith. So yeah, it’s that. It’s the finding of that network of support that you don’t always have."
