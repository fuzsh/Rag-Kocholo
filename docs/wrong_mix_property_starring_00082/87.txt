Miscellaneous Trivia[]

At the Spike Scream Awards in 2010 (filmed on Oct. 16, 2010, aired on Oct. 19, 2010), Bill Murray appeared in full Ghostbusters gear to accept his award for Best Cameo in Zombieland (and Zombieland's win for Best Horror Movie). Murray coyly said during his acceptance speech, "I'm sorry, I don't mean anything by this. It was just all that was left that was clean." He was signing autographs right before he came out, which somehow resulted in a smudge of permanent marker getting on his cheek, which is what was seen on the show. Also in the show was a Sigourney Weaver tribute by James Cameron, which included Ghostbusters clips and references. Later, Murray and Weaver were seen together backstage. According to Ghostbusters Fans (Fan Site), the flight suit was made by Sony for the promotion of Ghostbusters: The Video Game in 2008, and the Proton Pack was made by fan Sean Bishop.

Ghostbusters (1984) Trivia[]

In some instances, the original trio of Ghostbusters was said to always going to have been Dan Aykroyd, John Belushi, and Bill Murray.[1]

Murray started filming on October 27, 1983 after taking a Concorde to New York and driving to 62nd Street and Madison for an 11 am start.[2]

During filming at Columbia University, Bill Murray "wandered off" with a beautiful Chinese undergraduate student.[3]

During filming of the first movie, Sigourney Weaver would go to a corner to prepare herself for a scene but Bill Murray would sneak up behind her and goof around like tickle her or lift her up.[4][5]

During filming in New York City Hall, Bill Murray came up with the idea that Mayor Lenny and the Archbishop knew each other and were on a first name basis with each other. Murray also came up with the name "Lenny" on the spot.[6][7]

During the New York shoot, City Hall revoked the permit allowing the film crew to film the scene featuring Ecto-1's escort to 550 Central Park West out of concern about the traffic snarl it would cause. They revoke the permit on the day filming took place at City Hall. Bill Murray and Dan Aykroyd disappeared for one hour and approached Mayor Koch for help. Koch had the issue fixed so they could film the drive to Central Park West.[8]

One night during the Central Park West shoot, Dan Aykroyd and Bill Murray borrowed police motorcycles and rode around Central Park with the lights and sirens on, pulling over pedestrians.[9]

On January 20, 1984, scenes were filmed in the firehouse used in Los Angeles. Bill Murray missed his call by a couple hours. They started filming Annie Potts with a stand-in for Murray. By the time half of the scene was filmed, Murray arrived a little embarrassed he was so late so he started entertaining the crew. Potts wasn't as amused. He clearly didn't know what scene they were doing and was going to just improvise it. That was not feasible since half the scene was filmed. Murray started riffing, asking Potts what was wrong. William Atherton observed. Potts handled Murray and told him something to the effect of, "Enough, Murray. Enough." or "Nothing's wrong. I would just like you to stand on your f***ing mark and say your f***ing line! And then I'll be fine." Allegedly, the crew applauded her then filming started.[10][11]

Bill Murray didn't like Hughes and Thrall's attempts at a theme song. Murray wanted NRBQ.[12][13]

Bill Murray played a prank on Robin Williams when he visited the Temple of Gozer set with Chevy Chase. He had puppeteer Harrison Ray go into the Terror Dog puppet and stay still until his cue. Murray invited Williams to take a good look at the puppet. When Williams was about to touch it, Harrison Ray roared and raised the puppet's front paws. Williams stumbled backwards and almost fell off the set but Murray and others present grabbed him in time. Williams was not angry and instead laughed at how good they got him.[14]

On the Temple of Gozer set, Bill Murray sneaked up on Terri Hardin while she was in the Terror Dog suit during her lunch break and spooked her.[15]

Ghosbtusters II Trivia[]

During a videotaped rehearsal, Bill Murray went into a long tirade about an "unspecified indignity" Ivan Reitman forced him to do during the making of "Stripes."[16]

During filming of the courtroom scene, there was a fight between Bill Murray and propmaster Bill MacSeems about the weight of the Proton Pack prop. Murray slapped him then there was kicking and punching. First assistant director Peter Giuliano came between them. Murray came running towards MacSeems and Giuliano with a large wooden chair. Murray had MacSeems fired. A law suit was filed.[17]

In Ghostbusters II, Chapter 16: Vigo 101, Peter's "Let's suck in the guts" line was something Bill Murray said before filming as production was outfitting him for the scene and it was incorporated into the script.[18]

Peter's photography session with Vigo was Bill Murray's riff on famous fashion photographer Richard Avedon.[19]

Bill Murray recalled the Statue of Liberty crown gimbal was "quite a ride - nausea, sea legs, the whole thing."[20]

On August 8, 2015, it was reported that Bill Murray arrived late in the week in Boston to film his role for Ghostbusters (2016 Movie).[21]

Paul Feig simply wanted Martin Heiss to be the kind of person to wear suits but Bill Murray pitched basing the character's look off English writer and storyteller Quentin Crisp.[22]

Pat Kiernan returned to Boston a month after filming his initial scene to film a scene with Bill Murray. They filmed for 40 minutes with scripted and ad lib lines.[23][24][25]

While filming the scene with Pat Kiernan, Bill Murray recognized one of the technicians as someone he worked with on Saturday Night Live.[26]

On page 215 of Ghosts from Our Past: Both Literally and Figuratively: The Study of the Paranormal (Three Rivers Press), Bill Murray is thanked in the acknowledgment section.

Ghostbusters: Afterlife Trivia[]

Bill Murray was easy to get into contact with through Ivan Reitman and Gil Kenan, both who have directed him in past projects. Murray read the script, enjoyed it, and agreed to join the cast.[27]

On Bill Murray's first day on the Ghostbusters: Afterlife set, he was in his trailer trying to get the TV working so he could watch a Chicago Cubs game.[28]

Bill Murray had a tendency to strip the props off once a scene was done. In one instance, he left his Proton Pack prop on the floor and it was kicked by an Afterlife crew member by accident. Ben Eadie had to glue some pieces back on.[29]

One line Bill Murray improvised was right before the Ghostbusters fire at Gozer and Peter says "Count of three, go on two, one two blast."[30]

Bill Murray made fun of Ernie Hudson for having a pad hidden under his spot on the dirt ground for the insult scene. Hudson quipped it was for the stunt man.[31]

Bill Murray added variations on Peter's barrage of insults at Gozer. Only some ended in the theatrical version. Finn Wolfhard suggested Trevor should laugh to annoy Gozer even more but Jason Reitman urged him to keep playing it low-key.[32]

Olivia Wilde eventually broke character and laughed at Bill Murray's insults to Gozer.[33]

Ernie Hudson accidentally hit Bill Murray's head with his Particle Thrower prop after Jason Reitman called cut on the scene. It left a mark but Murray returned a few minutes later.[34]

Bill Murray gave armorer Ben Eadie a certificate for a free massage on the last day of shooting. It was in a balled up envelope so Eadie thought it was his copy of the script as usual. When it was time to take the props off Murray, Eadie thanked him and tried to return the envelope. Murray called him a dumb ass and told him it was a gift.[35][36]

The mid-credits tag between Peter and Dana took half a day to film. There was a script but it was unnecessary. Bill Murray improvised different takes of the scene.[37]
