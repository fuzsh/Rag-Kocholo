        "text": "Didn't Murray regret doing GB2? He only did it cos of the money I thought. I mean, if you are a fan of GB as a franchise, GB2 was enjoyable, but it didn't really need to exist. It didn't do anything better or different than the first. The ideas for GB3 were also out there.\n\nI don't think anyone was super positive about how GB2 came out, especially with the Columbia execs constantly breathing down the necks of Arkroyd, Ramis and Reitman to make it more and more like the cartoon, which was an enormous hit on TV and a bonanza for toy sales. Those three having much bigger presence behind the scenes in Hollywood (Reitman and Ramis both being directors themselves, and all three were writers and producers) was likely the reason why they demurred on raising that many objections towards those suggestions, but with Murray being mainly an actor, I don't think he had any problem saying the quiet part out loud.\n\nBut yeah, GB2 in general was not a fun production with how relatively little time they had to shoot for such an effects heavy film, and it basically dragged on and on in post-production as they wound up cutting a lot of the scenes they originally shot due to bad test screening impressions and found themselves having to deliver to the film in as close to the last minute as you could have gotten back in the day for the re-shoots to replace what got dropped. That it's watchable at all is a genuine miracle, even as the final product is decidedly underwhelming.\n\nI don't think anyone was super positive about how GB2 came out, especially with the Columbia execs constantly breathing down the necks of Arkroyd, Ramis and Reitman to make it more and more like the cartoon, which was an enormous hit on TV and a bonanza for toy sales.

The only weakness to me is that it cribs too much of the basic structure from 1. In all other respects I like it better than 1. Vigo is a better villain, the Scoleri Brothers scene is the best scene in both films and Janosz is THE BEST\n\nI don't think anyone was super positive about how GB2 came out, especially with the Columbia execs constantly breathing down the necks of Arkroyd, Ramis and Reitman to make it more and more like the cartoon, which was an enormous hit on TV and a bonanza for toy sales.

That it's watchable at all is a genuine miracle, even as the final product is decidedly underwhelming.\n\nI think Bill was generally cold on doing more Ghostbusters, especially during a certain period of time. Watching Ghostbusters 2 more recently, he's in it a lot less than I remember, and is completely absent from scenes that would have required him to be covered in ooze. He also, despite having done some pretty decent voice acting beforehand, sounded absolutely wooden and uninterested in the game. Then there was how he was pretty swiftly killed off in the 2016 movie, playing a skeptic that kind of felt like an unsubtle way of letting Bill take jabs at the Ghostbusters.\n\nWhile tensions between him and others, and his personal behaviours may have played a part in why Ghostbusters 3 never got made, it always struck me, especially with him always having remained the only hold out, even after sobering up, that it never happened because he just wasn't ever that endeared to it as a franchise, rathering to do other things.\n\nNah, GB2016 is by far the worst thing to come from the franchise. That, and the utterly mediocre video game spinoff.\n\nGB2016 is not a good movie but I'll watch it twice before I sit through GB2 again. GB2 has a strong claim on being the greatest drop in quality from first movie to sequel in film history. It's honestly astounding how wrong they got literally everything in the movie outside of the courtroom scene. At least GB2016 is just Paul Feig doing his usual mediocrity. GB2 has no excuses.\n\nI read an interview with Bill he was tricked into GB2. Apparently he liked whatever they were going to film but when it came to filming script was different?\n\nMost of his screen time is spent improvising with a baby, so I can certainly believe that what he read and what he ended up having to do were two very different things.\n\nGB2016 is not a good movie but I'll watch it twice before I sit through GB2 again.

GB2 has no excuses.\n\nI love Ghostbusters 2. It's not as good as the first, but that's a nearly impossible ask for any sequel to the original. The 2016 movie I've watched once and probably never again. It's an absolutely horrible Ghostbusters movie, and a merely passable comedy flick.\n\nAlso, I cannot express enough how hyped I am for Afterlife.\n\nGB2016 is not a good movie but I'll watch it twice before I sit through GB2 again.

GB2 has no excuses.\n\nGB2 is a perfectly fine movie. It doesn't really do anything new, but for a sequel it's perfectly fine. I'd say Gremlins to Gremlins 2 and Raiders of the Lost Ark to Temple of Doom are worse drops in sequel quality, with Silent Hill to Silent Hill: Revelations being possibly the most egregious example. GB2016 was just offensively bad. It was a movie full of fan disservice.\n\nI love Ghostbusters 2. It's not as good as the first, but that's a nearly impossible ask for any sequel to the original.

GB2 is fine as it is, but living up to the original was nearly impossible for a sequel.\n\nAnd yes, Afterlife is probably my most hyped movie in years.\n\nGB2016 is not a good movie but I'll watch it twice before I sit through GB2 again.

GB2 has no excuses.\n\nMost of his screen time is spent improvising with a baby, so I can certainly believe that what he read and what he ended up having to do were two very different things.\n\nLike others have said, Ghostbusters 2, at worst, is an inoffensive re-tread of the first movie. It's about the same as Home Alone 2 or Wayne's World 2. This idea that it's a horrible abomination of artistic integrity is ridiculous. Highlander 2 and Nightmare on Elm Street 2 are some actual examples of sequels with the biggest drop in quality from the first films.\n\nMeanwhile, Ghostbusters 2016 is genuinely on par with some of Adam Sandler's worst films. Maybe not quite Jack and Jill level, but still another terrible sleazy Sony Pictures comedy film bereft of actual comedy and filled to the brim with blatant product placement.\n\nIt's a really sad story.\n\nRamis's daughter has spoken about this a few times now but it basically comes down to:\n\nRamis & Murray started arguing a lot during the production of Groundhog Day\n\nMurray and Ramis ended work on Groundhog Day both feeling betrayed by the other\n\nTheir fights would continue past this until Ramis snapped, choked Murray by grabbing him by the collar and throwing him into a wall\n\nMurray cut ties, Ramis felt guilty but was unsurprised by Murray's feelings\n\nAllegedly, Bill Murray's drinking began to get out of control in the early 90's\n\nMurray's drinking resulted in a lot of sudden, angry outbursts in his personal life\n\nSeems to have gotten help in the early 2000's\n\nDespite this, tensions between Ramis and Murray had only grown during their silence\n\nApparently it was Brian Doyle-Murray who confronted Bill and told him it was time to take ownership of his own actions and forgive Ramis for his\n\nThis prompted Bill to show up to Ramis's home with a box of pastries to sit down and apologize\n\nAt this stage in Ramis's illness, it was difficult for him to speak so Bill did a lot of the talking, initially telling him how much he loved him and how sorry he was\n\nThey didn't spend a lot of time stewing on their conflict however, the conversation soon turned to shared laugher\n\nThey hung out for a few hours, joking around and sharing stories\n\nSupposedly Bill's interest in Afterlife is based on the movie being a massive tribute to Harold Ramis (and the two Reitman's involvement).\n\nGroundhog Day is one of my favorite movies, so sad to know that it was the turning point that would drive two best friends apart.\n\nI've known about the feud forever but this is the first time I've ever heard it in this much detail and that is genuinely heartbreaking to read.\n\nBut Ghostbusters 3 did happen.\n\nPeople keep saying this but in reality the game did not have a good story. It just felt like bit of a jumbled disjointed mess from what I remember of it and would asbolutely not have worked for a movie.\n\nThe rift between Ramis and Murray was always so sad.\n\nRami's daughter's book \"Ghostbusters Daughter\" touches on this a bit and changed my perspective on it a little.\n\nIt was not like Ramis and Murray were super best freinds before. They seemed to be buddies but from the book it seemed Murray's older brother Brian Doyle-Murray was a lot closer to Ramis. It doesn't make the rift not sad, but it's not like Ramis lost his best friend in the world.\n\nYeah I read a shitload about this, seems like this has mostly died down since the early 2000's. There are also a lot of stories about addiction and substance abuse leading to a lot of public temper tantrums throughout the 90's. It's so weird reading these stories and then comparing them to the cool, collected demeanor that so many of his characters exhibit.\n\nI think the Murray renaissance, which mostly sparked with fans telling funny and weird stories about meeting him in public, happened after he got healthy. That's also around the same point where people's stories about working with him start to lean more positive.\n\ninteresting to hear that he's reputedly mellowed out over the years\n\nI guess his frequent collaboration with Wes Anderson indicates he must have figured something out\n\nI always preferred GB2 to 1 tbh. The only weakness to me is that it cribs too much of the basic structure from 1. In all other respects I like it better than 1. Vigo is a better villain, the Scoleri Brothers scene is the best scene in both films and Janosz is THE BEST\n\nI don't dislike GB2. I think it's a pretty decent sequel and it's hard to live up to a cultural behemoth like GB1. I agree that Vigo is a better villain and Peter MacNicol is brilliant; there's something quite unsettling with his performance as he goes from friendly guy to creepy possessed monster. The bits when he uses his eyes like lights and then kidnaps the baby in the pushchair used to scare the crap out of me when I was little."
