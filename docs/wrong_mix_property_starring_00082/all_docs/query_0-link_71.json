        "text": "No one is thirstier for a quote-unquote “proper” sequel to “Ghostbusters II,” a “Ghostbusters” cinematic universe and a franchise that goes on forever than Dan Aykroyd. The original Ghostbuster and co-creator/co-writer of the original 1984 film had been trying to get a “Ghostbusters 3” written for a decade. That idea was turned down by director Paul Feig, but he eventually pitched and made the all-female version that turned into 2016’s “Ghostbusters.” But Aykroyd, vocally unhappy with Feig’s work on “Ghostbusters,” and his long-running dream of continuing the “Ghostbusters” series with a threequel, could become a reality if the actor/writer/producer has his way, however unlikely that may seem.\n\nREAD MORE: Bill Murray Reportedly Sends Dan Aykroyd & Harold Ramis Shredded ‘Ghostbusters 3’ Script\n\nAykroyd appeared in a recent episode of AXS TV’s The Big Interview with Dan Rather and revealed that, “There is a possibility of a reunion with the three remaining Ghostbusters… It’s being written right now.” No news on its casting this early on, but Aykroyd quickly mentioned Bill Murray, claiming “I think Billy will come. The story’s so good. Even if he plays a ghost.”\n\nREAD MORE: The 40 Best ‘Ghostbusters’ Characters Ranked\n\nAykroyd has long been a working advocate for a new sequel, developing potential scripts as far back as in the ‘90s, but none of his versions ever passed the mustard for Bill Murray and so to think the actor may be interested now borders on delusional given all the history and somewhat bad blood that floated in the press over the years. In fact, Murray seemed so soured on all the various “Ghostbusters 3” scripts that passed by his desk, he often publicly stated he had no interest in the project—perhaps realizing the idea is just long past its sell-by date (he eventually relented with a small cameo in the 2016 film).\n\nREAD MORE: ‘Ghostbusters’ Sequel Unlikely As Film Looks Poised To Post $70 Million Loss\n\nAykroyd’s beating of the “Ghostbusters 3” drum came somewhat close in the late aughts when “The Office” writers penned a script that was meant to be a handoff-to-a-new-generation concept that was eyeing actors like Bill Hader, Seth Rogen, Elizabeth Banks. The original “Ghostbusters” would have appeared as mentors in the movie.\n\nREAD MORE: Dan Aykroyd Says ‘Ghostbusters’ Director Paul Feig “Will Not Be Back On The Sony Lot Any Time Soon”\n\nBut the possibility of a “Ghostbusters 3” has been hit with setbacks particularly the death of the original’s star and co-writer Harold Ramis in 2014 and the critical and commercial failure of the 2016 version starring Melissa McCarthy and Kristen Wiig. That film largely flopped, quashed the idea of a sequel and even the mooted “Ghostbusters” universe Aykroyd has desperately craved (at one point another film was in the works with Channing Tatum and Chris Pratt, but quickly fell apart after “Ghostbusters” 2016).\n\nREAD MORE: ‘Ghostbusters’ And The Post-Truth Politics Of 2016 Blockbuster Culture\n\nAykroyd spent nearly a decade essentially saying, “we’re almost there” with a “Ghostbusters 3” film promising start dates, approved scripts, new, about-to-be announced casts, but none of it ever materialized.\n\nREAD MORE: READ MORE: Why Hollywood Needs To Question Their Faith In Remakes"
