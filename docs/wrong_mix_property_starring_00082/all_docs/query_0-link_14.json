        "text": "Dr. Peter Venkman is one of the original Ghostbusters. He has doctorates in both psychology and parapsychology. He appears in all major forms of the Ghostbusters Franchise. He is one of the main protagonists and arguably the leader of the Ghostbusters.\n\nCanonicity[]\n\nPeter in the Primary Canon is developed from Ghostbusters (1984), Ghostbusters II, Ghostbusters: Afterlife, and Ghostbusters: Frozen Empire. In Ghostbusters: The Video Game (Realistic Versions), a Secondary Canon, Ghostbusters (1984) and Ghostbusters II pre-date the game, Ghostbusters: Afterlife conflicts with the game. Peter (prime) appears in the IDW Comic Series, a Secondary Canon, which follows Ghostbusters (1984) and Ghostbusters II, also includes some elements from Ghostbusters: The Video Game (Realistic Versions) and Ghostbusters: The Video Game (Stylized Versions); as well as being canon to Tobin's Spirit Guide (Insight Editions). Peter (from Dimension 50-S) in the IDW Comic Series, is a alternate version based on Ghostbusters: Sanctum of Slime. Ghostbusters: Sanctum of Slime video game, deemed a Tertiary Canon, follows Ghostbusters (1984) and Ghostbusters II.\n\nHistory[]\n\nPrimary Canon History[]\n\nBefore Ghostbusters (1984)[]\n\nPeter Venkman was born on October 25, 1954 in Brooklyn, New York.[3] He later earned doctorates in parapsychology and psychology then became a professor at Columbia University where he worked with Dr. Egon Spengler and Dr. Ray Stantz. The trio researched the supernatural but, unlike his partners, Peter was not as enthusiastic about the topic and was skeptical about the existence of ghosts. Egon and Ray were usually the first to interview case subjects, even people Peter called \"schizos\" no matter how far-fetched their stories were. Egon once tried to drill a hole in his own head, utilizing a process known as trepanation. Egon believed it \"would have worked\" but Peter prevented him from going through with trying to replicate it. At some point, someone used lipstick to write \"Venkman burn in hell\" over the names of Peter, Egon, and Ray on the door to the Paranormal Studies Laboratory.\n\nGhostbusters (1984)[]\n\nIn 1984, Peter conducted an ESP experiment with volunteers in Room 205 A in Weaver Hall. Peter instructed the male volunteer he was going to turn over the next card, wanted him to concentrate, and tell him what he thought it was. The male volunteer and female volunteer, Jennifer, were wired to electrodes of an Electro-Shock Generator. He held up the back of the card to them. The card was a star. The male student guessed it was a square. Peter revealed the card to them and shocked him. Peter turned to Jennifer and smiled. Peter told her to clear her head. She smiled. He held up the next card. It was a circle. Peter asked her what she thought it was. The male student watched her. Jennifer asked if it was a star. Peter lied and pretended to be amazed she was correct. She was ecstatic. He held up a card for the male student. He instructed him to think hard. The male student guessed it was a circle. Peter revealed a square then shocked him. Pink gum shot out of his mouth. He grabbed it off the table, put it back in his mouth, and continued chewing. Peter jotted down a note, asked Jennifer is she was ready, and held up the next card for Jennifer. It was a plus sign. He pressed the eraser end of a pencil on the side of his head, smiled, and asked what it was. Jennifer stared at the back of the card. She guessed figure eight. Peter pretended to be surprised again. He remarked she was five for five. He asked if she could see the card. Peter moved the card around and squinted. The male student tried looking from her vantage point. Jennifer smiled and swore she wasn't cheating, the answers were coming to her.\n\nPeter turned to the male student. The male student grabbed at his collar. Peter asked if he was nervous. The male student admitted he was. Peter reminded them they only had 75 more to go. He held up the next card. It had three wavy lines. The male student guessed it was a couple of wavy lines but Peter lied and told him it was wrong. Peter reached for the lever. The male student stuttered. Jennifer looked amused by the tension. Peter winked at her. Peter electrocuted him. The male student got agitated. Peter countered he volunteered and would be paid. The male student pointed out he didn't know Peter was giving the volunteers electric shocks. He asked Peter what he was trying to prove. Peter pressed his hands together and revealed he was studying the effect of negative reinforcement on ESP ability. The male student became irate and screamed the effect was the shocks were pissing him off. Peter stood and countered maybe his theory was correct. The male student ripped the electrodes off his hands, told Peter to keep the five bucks, then he stormed out of the room and slammed the door. Peter yelled he would. He changed his demeanor as he sat down next to Jennifer. He warned Jennifer to get used to that kind of resentment because her ability was going to provoke some people. Jennifer asked Peter if he really thought she had a gift. Peter promised her she was no fluke.\n\nRay returned to the Paranormal Studies Laboratory excited about a ghost sighting at the New York City Public Library, nearly killing the mood Peter Venkman had created with Jennifer. Ray exclaimed, \"This is it! This is definitely it!\" Ray grabbed a Camcorder off a table near Peter then asked him if those UV lenses came in for the video camera and for the blank tape that he erased the day before. Ray gathered equipment from a shelf. Peter turned to Jennifer and asked if she would excuse him. Peter crept over to Ray, hopped off the floor, and cartoonishly slapped him on the head as he told him he was right in the middle of something. He pretended to be talking to Ray in normal fashion by the time Jennifer peaked over. Peter insisted he needed a little more time with Jennifer and asked him he could come back in an hour or hour and a half. Ray stated at 1:40 p.m. at the main branch of the New York Public Library on Fifth Avenue, ten people witnessed a free-floating, full-torso, vaporous apparition, it blew books off shelves from 20 away, and scared some poor librarian. Peter, uninterested, tried to handle him and told him get right down there, check it out and get back to him. Ray shook his head and told Peter he was coming, too. He revealed Egon took P.K.E. valances and it went right off the top of the scale. Ray emphasized it buried the needle and they were close. He could feel it. He walked past Peter. Peter repeated to himself that he could feel it and they were very, very close. He sat back down next to Jennifer and told her he had to go but he would like to work with her some more. He asked her if she could come back in the evening. Jennifer suggested 8:00. Peter, still pretending astonishment, lied he was just going to say 8:00. He called her a legitimate phenomenon. She giggled.\n\nPeter and Ray briskly walked up the stairs to the New York Public Library. It appeared Peter was talking Ray's ear off the whole time from Columbia to the library. Peter tried to break it to Ray that he finally had gone around the bend on the \"ghost business.\" He brought up how he and Egon met every \"schizo\" in the five boroughs who claimed to have had a paranormal experience. He asked Ray what he had actually seen so far. As they entered the South Wing of the Main Reading Room from the Southern side doorway to the Art and Architecture Reading Room, Ray reminded Peter he was present at an undersea, unexplained Mass Sponge Migration. Peter reacted as if he probably heard that story for the umpteenth time and countered the sponges migrated about a foot and a half. They found Egon. Peter sneaked over then, in a faux zombie voice, uttered, \"Egon...\" Egon perked up. Peter rapped the table with his knuckles then slammed a hardcover book down. Egon was startled and jumped. He finally noticed Peter and Ray. Peter asked Egon what he had. Egon stated it was very big and there was definitely something present. Peter smiled remembered the time Egon tried to drill a hole through his head. Egon quickly countered it would have worked if he hadn't stopped him.\n\nRoger Delacorte, a library administrator, walked up behind them and introduced himself. Peter took the lead and introduced himself as \"Dr. Venkman,\" Ray as \"Dr. Stantz,\" and Egon as \"Egon.\" Roger shook Peter's hand then Ray's, and Egon nodded once. Roger thanked them for coming and expressed his hope that they could clear it up quickly and quietly. Peter warned against rushing into things before they knew what was going on. Roger, Peter, and Ray went into the office dividing the north and south wings of the Reading Room. Alice recalled not seeing any legs, but it definitely had arms because it reached out for her. Peter sat near Alice and told her he was going to ask her a couple of standard questions. He started off by asking if she or anyone in her family were ever been diagnosed schizophrenic or mentally incompetent. She remembered her uncle thought he was St. Jerome. Peter made a face and countered that as a big yes. He asked her if she was habitually using drugs, stimulants, alcohol. She wasn't. Peter asked her if she was currently menstruating. Roger nervously asked what that had to do with it. Peter stated, \"Back off, man. I'm a scientist.\" Egon entered the office and reported the ghost was on the move.\n\nPeter came down the stairs to the basement stacks last, lacking any interest and rolling his eyes. He started to make scary hand gestures at Ray. They found an incredibly tall stack of books in an aisle. Egon swept his P.K.E. Meter around the stack and stated it was hot. Ray recalled the term, Symmetrical book-stacking, and it was just like the Philadelphia Mass Turbulence of 1947. Peter dryly and sarcastically agreed, noting no human being would stack books like this. Ray suddenly turned and instructed everyone to listen then asked them if they smelled something. Peter sniffed the air. They came across the card catalog that Alice ran away from. Cards were all over the place covered in clear hued Ectoplasm. Ray was amazed with the telekinetic activity. Egon held out a Plastic Petri Dish and asked Peter to get a sample. Peter grumbled. Egon stated he would like to analyze it. Peter scraped Ectoplasm from a drawer into the petri dish. It was not working and some of the residue got on Peter's hands. Peter groaned and grunted. He tried to flick it away. Some got on his face. Ray told Peter to come on. Peter grunted. He started slapping books and wiping random book spines. He stepped on some slimed cards and yelled \"Dah!\" He lifted his foot and tried to shake the cards off. A green wood bookcase creaked and suddenly fell down face first behind them onto the floor. They all stared at the bookcase. As the dust kicked up in the air, Peter calmly turned to Ray and asked if that happened to him before. Ray slowly shook his head 'no' and Peter asked if that his first time. Ray slowly nodded 'yes' and they continued on.\n\nThey found the ghost in the middle of looking at a spinner rack. Peter asked what they were going to do next. Egon and Ray were silent and looked at each other. Peter rolled his eyes and asked them to come over for a talk. He pulled Ray by the ear into an aisle. The ghost looked over at them. Ray was not sure what to do and turned to Egon. Egon took out a calculator and started typing but Peter yelled at him to stop that and knocked it out of his hands. It tattered on the floor. Ray proposed they make contact. Egon agreed. They both looked at Peter. Peter huffed over the silent vote. He walked out of the aisle and greeted the ghost, introduced himself, and asked her where it was from. He kicked himself and clarified, \"Originally.\" The ghost only shushed him. Peter returned to the aisle, corralling Ray and Egon back into the aisle. Ray had a new plan. He instructed them to stay close and do exactly as he said. They inched back out and slowly moved closer. Ray suddenly exclaimed, \"Get her!\" The ghost transmogrified into a monstrous form and screamed \"Rah!\" at them. They backed away almost in unison then left the library. Roger came out the door after them and asked them if they saw it and what it was. Peter yelled they would get back to him. Peter, Ray, and Egon had returned to Columbia University and walked through campus alongside the Low Library. Peter laughed and teased Ray about his plan. He found it scientific. Ray admitted he just got overexcited. He was still beaming about actually touched the etheric plane. He then asked Peter what this could mean to the university. Peter proclaimed it was going to be bigger than the microchip. Egon revealed the experience wasn't completely wasted. According to the new P.K.E. readings he took, Egon believed they had an excellent chance of actually catching a ghost and holding it indefinitely. The gears turned in Peter's head and he hurried up to them. Ray thought it was great and speculated if the ionization rate was constant for all ectoplasmic entities, they could really bust some heads in a spiritual sense. Peter asked Egon if he was really serious about catching a ghost. Egon stated he was always serious. Peter got out a Crunch bar and told Egon he was going take back some of the things he said about him. Peter was about to hand it to Egon but hesitated then gave it and told him he earned it. Ray grinned and chuckled as Egon looked at the bar.\n\nSubsequently, they found out from Dean Yeager that their funding was cut and they were fired from their university positions. At first, Peter presumed they were being moved to better quarters on campus. Dean Yeager replied they were being moved off campus because the Board of Regents decided to terminate their grant. He instructed them to vacate the premises immediately. Peter closed his eyes then stated the situation was preposterous and demanded an explanation. Yeager obliged Peter and stated Columbia was no longer continuing any funding of any kind for their group's activities. Peter countered the kids loved them. Yeager stated Columbia believed the purpose of science was to serve mankind and pointed out Peter seemed to regard science as some kind of dodge or hustle. He critiqued Peter's theories as the worst kind of popular tripe, told him his methods were sloppy, and thought his conclusions were highly questionable. He called Peter a poor scientist. Peter only replied, \"I see.\" Yeager concluded he had no place in the department or in the university.\n\nRay paced outside while Peter lied on stone left of the exterior of the Low Library and drank a swig from his liquor. Ray thought it was a major disgrace and uttered they should forget employment at MIT or Stanford, who wouldn't touch them with a ten-meter cattle-prod. Peter remarked he was always so concerned about his reputation and pointed out Einstein did his best stuff when he was working as a patent clerk. Ray asked Peter if he knew how much a patent clerk earned. Peter was not aware. Ray explained he liked the university because they gave them money and facilities and they didn't have to produce anything. He pointed out Peter was never out of college and didn't know what it was like out there. Ray reminded Peter he worked in the private sector and they expected results. Peter got on his feet, placed his arm on Ray, and walked him to the top of the stairs. He told Ray for whatever reasons, call it fate, call it luck, call it karma, he believed that everything happened for a reason. He believed that they were destined to get thrown out of this dump. He walked Ray over to the top of the stairs looking out at the courtyard. Ray asked for what purpose. Peter answered it was for them to go into business for themselves. He offered Ray a drink. Ray drank and calmed down. He stated the ecto-containment system that he and Egon had in mind was going to require a load of bread to capitalize. He asked Peter where they were going to get the money from. Peter drank then replied twice that he didn't know. Peter encouraged and prodded Ray to mortgage his house in order to find the capital for their freelance ghost catching idea.\n\nSome time later, Peter, Ray, and Egon emerged from the Manhattan City Bank at 489 Fifth Avenue in suits. Peter opened the doors. Ray stared at a manila envelope in his hands. Peter promised Ray he was never going to regret it. Ray stated his parents left him that house and he was born there. Peter reassured him he was not going to lose the house and everybody had three mortgages nowadays. Ray questioned settling at 19 percent and not bargaining. Egon finished a calculation and flashed his Casio Micro-Mini Calculator to Ray. Egon stated the interest rate alone for the first five years came to $95,000. Peter told them to relax and reminded them they were are on the threshold of establishing the indispensable defense science of the next decade, professional paranormal investigations and eliminations. He pined the franchise rights alone would make them rich beyond their wildest dreams. He gestured 'rich' with his hands. Ray shook his head.\n\nThey checked out Hook & Ladder No. 8 in Lower Manhattan. The Real Estate Woman told Egon and Peter there was office space, sleeping quarters and showers on the next floor and there was a full kitchen on the top left. Egon and Peter looked around the garage bay. Peter commented that it seemed a little pricey for a unique fixer-upper opportunity. He asked Egon what he thought. Egon grazed Peter's right arm and stated he thought the building should be condemned because there was serious metal fatigue in all the load-bearing members, the wiring was substandard, it was completely inadequate for their power needs, and the neighborhood was like a demilitarized zone. Ray called out to them from upstairs. He wondered if the pole still worked. They looked up at Ray. Ray slid down the fire pole. Ray was excited and thought the place was great. He asked when they could move in and invited them to try this pole. Ray ran up the stairs to get his stuff and paused. The real estate woman turned to Egon and Peter with a smile. Ray suggested they sleep over that night to try it out. Peter looked at Egon. Egon slowed shook his head 'no' as the real estate woman took some steps closer to them. Peter turned to her and informed her they were taking it.\n\nPeter, Ray, and Egon filmed a commercial outside Hook & Ladder No. 8. Peter's line after Ray's was, \"Have you or any of your family ever seen a spook, specter or ghost?\" Ray continued then inn unison, they said, \"Ghostbusters.\" The commercial ended with them saying, \"We're ready to believe you!\" Peter supervised Marty and watched him put up a sign that read \"GHOSTBUSTERS\" in small type face. Peter asked Marty if he thought the sign was too subtle and people wouldn't see the sign. Marty turned his head to Peter and shook his head. A dark black hearse drove up to the firehouse. Peter tried to peer inside and yelled at the driver not to park there. Ray got out of the car. He announced he found the car and revealed it needed some suspension work, shocks, brakes, brake pads, linings, steering box, transmission, and a rear end. Peter asked how much it cost. Ray replied it only cost $4800. Peter was shocked speechless, not in a good way. Ray droned on it might need new rings, also mufflers, and a little wiring.\n\nJanine Melnitz, the Ghostbusters' secretary, sat at her desk on the first floor of the Firehouse reading a People Weekly magazine. Peter walked to her desk with a file under his right arm. Peter asked her if there were any calls. Janine replied, \"No.\" Peter asked if there were any messages. Janine replied, \"No.\" Peter asked if there were any customers Janine looked up at him and replied, \"No, Dr. Venkman.\" Peter jokingly asked her if it was a good job. He asked her to type something since they were paying her. Peter continued on into his office area behind hers. He told her not to stare at him because she had the \"bug eyes.\" He apologized to Janine then told her he would be in his office. Peter soon became the first to meet the company's first client, Dana Barrett and formed a romantic interest. Dana entered the Firehouse and asked Janine if she was in the Ghostbusters' office. Janine confirmed that and asked how she could help her. Peter peaked up from his office like a gopher out of its hole. Dana admitted she didn't have an appointment but wanted to talk to someone. Peter bolted to them. He narrowly jumped over the office gate. Peter introduced himself. Dana cautioned what she had to say may sound a little unusual. Peter joked that's all they got day in, day out. He invited her into his office. Janine looked up at him in disbelief. Dana introduced herself.\n\nDana was hooked up to the Aura Video-Analyzer upstairs on the second floor and was interviewed by Peter, Ray, and Egon. Dana concluded her story and told them there was a voice that said \"Zuul\" and then she slammed the refrigerator door and left. She recounted that was two days ago, and she had not been back to her apartment since. Peter remarked you generally did not see that kind of behavior in a major appliance. He asked her what she thought it was. Dana got annoyed and told him if she knew what it was, she would not have come. Peter asked Egon what he thought. Egon turned to Peter with his head lamp still on. Peter was blinded. He swatted at the air until Egon clicked the light off. Peter opened his eyes in a daze. Egon noted Dana was telling the truth or at least, she thought she was. Dana stammered she was telling the truth and asked who would make up a story like that. Peter informed her they ran into some people who just wanted attention and a lot of nutballs who came in off the street. Ray and Egon speculated but Dana admitted she did not believe in any of the supernatural. Peter went next to her and told her he did not either. Egon and Ray exchanged looks. Peter walked behind Dana and gestured to Ray and Egon to make something up as he told her there were standard procedures they did in cases hers that gave them results. Ray figured he could go down to hall of records and check out the structural details in the building. He guessed the building itself could have a history of psychic turbulence. Peter nodded and agreed. Egon suggested he could look for the name Zuul in the usual literature. Ray thought of Spates Catalog. Egon mentioned Tobin's Spirit Guide. Ray agreed. Peter suggested he would take Dana back to her apartment and check her out. She looked up at him. Peter corrected himself and stated he would go check out her apartment. He turned to her. She nodded. He quietly grumbled about his flub. Dana thanked him. She got up and walked away. Peter smacked his head and made a face as he followed her.\n\nDana slowly opened her front door and inched in. Peter swung the door open and asked her to let him go first in case something happened. He bolted over to her and opened the door behind her. He pointed the Ghost Sniffer around. Dana noted that was just the closet. Peter went to the piano. He lifted the cover and played the two highest notes over and over. He remarked the ghosts hated the sound. Peter warned the non-existent ghosts he was present. He stayed in the middle of the room and used the Sniffer. Dana looked around and started to take her coat off. Peter remarked the apartment had a lot of space. He asked her if she lived alone. She confirmed it. He noted, \"Good.\" She pondered what he meant. He looked at some books stacked on a table. She asked what he was doing with his device. Peter told her it was technical and it was one of their \"little toys.\" He quickly went to another door. Dana told him that was the bedroom, but nothing ever happened in there. Peter looked inside then closed the door and remarked what a crime that was. Dana paused then noted he did not act like a scientist. Peter surmised she meant they were usually pretty stiff. She believed he was more like a game show host. Peter was at a loss. He turned his head and asked her if that was the kitchen. She nodded.\n\nPeter pushed the door open. Dana turned the light on. Everything was still there from when Dana left. Peter tossed the paper bag aside. Peter saw the eggs on the counter and asked her if those were the ones. She confirmed and recounted where she was standing when they just jumped right out of their shells and started to cook on the counter. Peter agreed that was weird. Dana continued and told him that was when she heard that awful noise coming from the refrigerator. Peter lifted up the lettuce and the cooked eggs. Dana asked him if he wanted to check the refrigerator. Peter thought that was a good call. She sighed. Peter slowly opened the refrigerator a crack and remarked, \"Oh, my God.\" Dana became worried. Peter opened it wider and addressed all the junk food. Dana got frustrated. Peter took out an Oscar Mayer pack and asked her if she actually ate it. Dana took it away and exclaimed she saw a big space. Peter lifted the lid off a ceramic dish, it didn't smell good to him. She pointed out there was a building or something with flames coming out of it, there were creatures writhing around growling and snarling, and she heard a voice say \"Zuul.\" Peter apologized and told her he was not getting any reading. Dana questioned if he was using the Sniffer correctly. Peter thought he was and confirmed there were no animals in there. Dana resigned herself to the face there was a monster in her kitchen or she was completely crazy. Peter told her he did not think she was crazy. Dana sarcastically replied she felt so much better. She walked away.\n\nPeter followed her back into the living room and told her he came home from work to his place, and all he had was his work. He sat down. Before Dana could speak, Peter continued and claimed she had the same problem he had. She curtly identified that problem as him. Peter went for broke and admitted he was madly in love with her. She scoffed and looked away from him then asked him to leave. Peter self-narrated about being thrown out of her life, guessed she thought he was a creep and a geek, and she probably was not the first. Dana remarked he was so odd. Peter stopped at the front door and turned to her. She said, \"No.\" Peter declared he got it. She repeated, \"No\" many times. Peter stated he would prove himself to her. She countered that was not necessary. She started to guide him to the door. Peter believed solving her problem would get her thinking about what made him tick and she was going to be thinking about him after he left. Dana smiled and bet she would. Before she could completely close the door, Peter stuck his face back in and asked for a kiss. She pushed his face out the door and slammed it shut. Louis Tully came out of his apartment, thinking it was Dana, and tried to go in but he was locked out. He stood with his back to his door. Peter went down the hall lost in thought.\n\nAfter that incident, Peter, Egon, and Ray ate Chinese takeout for dinner at the Firehouse. Peter raised his Budweiser and made a toast to their first customer. Ray raised his Budweiser and glumly toasted to their first and only customer. Egon stopped working on a particle thrower and raised his TaB. They drank. Peter wanted to use petty cash to take Dana on a date under the pretense of making overtures to keep her as a client. Ray informed him their dinner was the last of the petty cash. Peter was silent then told him to chew slower. Downstairs, Janine got a call and hit the alarm. They suited up and went to the Sedgewick Hotel. Peter asked out loud if anybody saw a ghost. A beautiful woman passed by them. They all stared and smiled. The Hotel manager walked up from behind them and thanked them for coming so quickly. Peter yelped in surprise. They walked together down the main hall. The hotel manager explained the guests were starting to ask questions and he was running out of excuses. Ray asked him if it happened before. The manager replied most of the original staff knew about the twelfth floor then clarified he meant \"the disturbances.\" He recalled it had been quiet for years up until two weeks ago and it was never, ever this bad. Peter patted him on the left shoulder. Egon asked if he ever reported it to anyone. The manager was mortified at the prospect. Peter played along. Egon rolled his eyes. The manager added the owners did not even like the staff talking about it. The manager hoped they could take care of it quietly. Peter promised it was done. The manager emphasized it was to be done that night. Egon, Peter, and Ray headed to the elevators. A man already waiting looked at them and asked what they were supposed to be. He ventured a guess they were some kind of a cosmonaut. Peter chuckled and explained they were exterminators who got brought in because somebody saw a cockroach up on the twelfth floor. The man remarked that had to be some cockroach. Peter warned him it could bite his head off. As the elevator went up, Ray sighed and realized they really haven't had a completely successful test of their equipment. Egon blamed himself. Peter echoed him. Ray remarked there was no sense worrying about it now. Peter dryly joked they were each wearing an unlicensed nuclear accelerator on his back. Ray, not realizing he was sarcastic, asked anyone to switch him on. Egon turned on a switch behind Ray. As it activated, Egon backed up, making Peter move aside from his spot.\n\nOn the 12th floor, Ray and Egon were startled by a Chambermaid and blasted her cart with the proton streams. Peter yelled at them to hold their fire. She peered out from behind the cart and asked them what the hell they were you doing? Egon, Peter, then Ray all apologized to her as she gathered up her supplies off the floor. Peter turned around to them and remarked that was a successful test. Ray agreed and suggested they split up. Egon concurred. Peter also agreed and mused they could do more damage that way. They separated and headed down different corridors. Peter came face to face with Slimer as it hovered on the other side of the hall. He grabbed his Radio off his belt without taking his eyes of Slimer and hailed Ray. Ray repeatedly exclaimed he saw it. Peter told Ray it was in his hall and it was looking at him. Ray remarked he was an ugly little spud. Peter warned Ray it could could hear him. Ray instructed Peter not to move and it won't hurt him. Slimer took off from his side of the hall and roared. Peter screamed and shielded his face. Ray ran to Peter and yelled to him. By the time Ray arrived, Slimer was long gone. Peter was lying on the floor drenched in Ectoplasm. Ray asked Peter what happened and if he was you okay. Peter spat out some Ectoplasm and stated it slimed him. Ray was amazed they made \"actual physical contact.\" He asked Peter if he could you move. Egon came over the radio band and hailed Ray. Peter remarked he felt so funky. Ray replied to Egon he was with Peter who got slimed. Egon asked Ray to save some for him then told them to get down stairs right away. He revealed Slimer just went into a ballroom.\n\nRay sighted Slimer flying around a chandelier. TPeter confirmed that was the one that got him. They slowly stepped out from the curtain. Ray gave the signal to open fire. All three fired at Slimer. They missed and nailed the chandelier. Slimer flew away. The chandelier fell on a table and smashed it. Ray admitted it was his fault. Peter pointed out it was okay because the table broke the fall. Egon remembered something very important he forgot to tell them. Peter asked him what that was. Egon told them don't Cross the Streams. Peter looked side to side then asked why. Egon stated it would be bad. Peter countered he was fuzzy on the whole good/bad thing and asked him what he meant by \"bad.\" Egon clarified with an example. He told them to try to imagine all life as you know it stopping instantaneously and every molecule in your body exploding at the speed of light. Ray realized he was talking about total protonic reversal. Peter understood that was bad or supposed to be bad. He thanked Egon for important safety tip. He told Ray to take the left and Egon to take the right. Peter headed straight down. Slimer chugged a bottle. Peter gave Ray the order first. Slimer stopped drinking and panicked. Ray opened fire. Slimer yelped and flew away. Peter cued Egon. Egon fired. He totally destroyed crystal ware, a three layer cake, and many, many dishes. Slimer flew behind the bar. Egon opened fire. Slimer flew away. Egon kept firing into the bar. Peter and Ray looked up at Slimer. Peter yelled at Egon to hold it and in a faux Texan voice told him, \"Nice shooting, Tex!\"\n\nRay wanted some room to put the Trap down. He asked Peter and Egon to give him some room. Peter and Egon threw a table aside then another. Ray emphasized they had to have the Trap in the clear. Peter held out his hands to them to stop. Peter admitted he always wanted to do something. He pulled the white tablecloth out from a table. All the dishes and utensils were upended. But... the flowers were still standing. Ray guided Egon to fire a confinement stream then gave Peter the go. Peter fired and wrangled Slimer, too. Ray instructed them to start bringing Slimer down. He reminded them not to cross the stream. Peter remarked maybe now it would never slime a guy with a positron collider. Egon told Peter to shorten his stream so his face would not get burned off. Peter looked down at his thrower in confusion. Ray announced he was opening the trap now and reminded them not to look directly into the Trap. Slimer was successfully trapped. Peter peeked around with one eye open. Egon got down on one knee and touched the Trap. Peter slightly nudged it with a foot. Blue electricity arced briefly. Egon looked up at them and confirmed it was in there. Peter aimed at the Trap. Ray was relieved and thought that wasn't such a chore.\n\nJust as Mr. Smith was about the open the door, the Ghostbusters came out. Peter declared, \"We came, we saw, we kicked its ass!\" The manager asked them if they saw it and what it was. Ray confirmed they got it. Peter turned away from Mrs. Van Hoffman and got out a blue notepad and pen from the pocket under his name tag. Peter eyed Egon as he spoke. Peter cleared his throat twice then signaled it was time to talk seriously. As Peter talked about the cost of entrapment, Egon flashed four fingers against his left cheek to Peter. Peter stated it would cost $4000. He then informed the manager they were having a special that week on proton charging and storage of the beast. Egon nodded and touched the tip of his nose with his right index finger. Peter revealed that was only going to come to $1000. The Manager stiffened up and refused to pay them $5000. The Manager stuffed his handkerchief back in his suit pocket. Peter told him that was all right and they could just put it right back in there. Ray confirmed that was true. They turned back towards the ballroom. The manager ran to them and caved. He ran up to Ray and grabbed his arm then stated he would pay anything. Peter ripped an invoice out, thanked the manager, handed him the bill, patted his arm, and walked down the hall with Ray close behind. Peter held an impromptu press conference outside the Sedgewick Hotel. Reporters jotted down as Peter spoke. Peter pitched the Ghostbusters worked twenty-four hours a day, seven days a week, no job was too big, and no fee was too big.\n\nThe Ghostbusters became popular and got busy around town with catching other ghosts. Peter and Ray headed to Ecto-1 outside the Tai Hong Lau Restaurant at 70 Mott Street. A man ran after them and handed out two roast duck. Ray and Peter turned around and Ray bowed in thanks then Peter as they accepted the ducks. Peter, Ray, and Egon jogged out of Rockefeller Center. Peter had on Ecto Goggles and was holding a smoking Trap. The Ghostbusters, with their particle throwers drawn, jogged down Mott Street in Chinatown, going from 56 to 64 Mott Street. The Ghostbusters were called to the fashionable dance club, The Rose, where they slugged it out with a \"pretty pesky poltergeist,\" then stayed on to dance the night away with some of the lovely ladies who witnessed the disturbance. One day when Ecto-1 pulled up to the Firehouse, two fans asked a ragged looking Peter for his autograph as he got out. A man in a brown coat was on the left side snapping Polaroid photographs. All the articles about the Ghostbusters were affixed to the back wall of Peter's office.\n\nA weary Peter and Ray returned from a case in Brooklyn and both were smoking. Their flightsuits had some ectoplasmic residue splattered about. Ray stated he needed some sleep badly. Peter agreed he didn't look good. Ray was surprised by Peter's observation. Peter thought he looked better and didn't used to look like this. Peter tossed an invoice on Janine's desk. She scoffed at the smoke from the Traps. Peter told her that was the paper on the Brooklyn job and the female client paid with Visa. Janine handed out a piece of paper and told them that was the evening worksheet then brought Winston Zeddemore to their attention. Ray stopped and turned around. Ray took one look at him and hired him for the open position. He introduced himself and Peter. Peter congratulated Winston and shook his hand. She told Peter there was a man waiting in his office from the EPA and she had been working two weeks without a break and that he promised he would hire more help. Peter remarked someone with her qualifications would have no trouble finding a topflight job in either the food service or housekeeping industries. As the phone rang once more, Peter replied to her, \"Are you going to answer that?\"\n\nPeter soon met the representative, Walter Peck in his office. Peter entered and asked how he could help him. Peck introduced himself then stood. He continued that he represented the Environmental Protection Agency, the third district. Peter shook his hand and asked how it was going down there. Peck looked at the ectoplasmic residue on his hand and got out his handkerchief. Peter patted his shoulder and left more ectoplasm. Peck noticed it. Peck asked him if he was Peter Venkman. Peter sat at his desk and clarified he was \"Dr. Venkman.\" Peck asked exactly what kind of doctor he was. Peter stated he had Ph.D.'s in parapsychology and psychology. He slightly gestured to his framed degrees on the wall. Peck noted he now caught ghosts. Peter found that an acceptable summary. Peck asked how many ghosts had been caught. Peter replied he was not at liberty to say. Peck asked where the ghosts went after they were captured. Peter told him they went into a storage facility. Janine peeked at them. Peck asked if the storage facility was located on the premises. Peter confirmed that. Peck asked to see it. Peter said no. Peck asked why not and turned to Peter. Peter revealed he had not used the magic word. Peck pulled up one of the chairs and sat. He asked what was the magic word. Peter was shocked and answered, \"Please.\" Peck sneered and asked if he could please see the storage facility. Peter asked why he wanted to see the storage facility Peck's demeanor changed. Peck admitted he was curious and wanted to know more about the Ghostbusters' operations in order assess for any possible environmental impact like the presence of noxious, possibly hazardous waste chemicals in their basement. Peck demanded to see the storage facility or he would come back with a court order. Peter told him to go get a court order. He stood and told Peck he would sue him for wrongful prosecution. Peck stood up and was face-to-face with Peter. Peck warned Peter he could have it his way and left. Peter went to the basement and walked over to the Containment Unit. He told Egon, Ray, and Winston they had a visit from the Environmental Protection Agency then asked how the was grid holding up. Ray remarked not good. Winston implored Egon to tell him about \"the The Twinkie Twinkie.\" Peter turned to them and was concerned. He inquired what about it.\n\nPeter had stopped by at one of Dana's orchestra rehearsals at Lincoln Center. After the rehearsal, she noticed Peter near the fountain hopping in a line on one leg. She walked over to him. Peter told her she was the best one in her row. She thanked him and noted most people could not hear her with the whole orchestra playing. Peter retorted he did not have to take that abuse from her because he had hundreds of people dying to abuse him. The Violinist circled them and sat down at the fountain. Dana noted he was a celebrity then asked about her case. Peter noticed the Violinist. The Violinist inserted some nasal spray in each nostril. He asked her, \"Who's the stiff?\" She answered \"The stiff happens to be one of the finest musicians in the world.\" She pressed him for information on her case. Peter confirmed he did but wanted to tell her in private. She suggested telling her now. Peter complied and revealed they found the name Zuul. It was a demigod worshiped around 6000 B.C. but Peter paused and asked how to say a word. Dana leaned in and looked at his paper. She pronounced Hittites for him. He continued and said Zuul was worshiped by the Hittites, the Mesopotamians and the Sumerians. Dana took the paper and read the notes. She read out loud that Zuul was the minion of Gozer. She asked what Gozer was. Peter hinted Gozer was very big in Sumeria. She wanted to know what Gozer was doing in her refrigerator. Peter assured her they were working on it and suggested getting together Thursday night, around nine-ish, to exchange information. Dana smiled and told him she was busy. Peter observed she seemed to think there was something wrong up with her thinking he enjoyed taking his evenings off and spending it with his clients. The Violinist clutched his case. Peter claimed he was making a special exception in your case because he respected her as an artist and as a dresser. He admired the \"magnificent coordination\" she was wearing. Trying to keep down commotion, Dana reluctantly said, \"I'll see you Thursday.\" He promised to bring The Roylance Guide to Secret Societies and Sects and they would eat and read. She tried to leave with the Violinist. The Violinist looked at Peter. Peter acknowledged him. The Violinist asked who the hell Peter was. Dana replied he was just a friend. The Violinist wasn't buying it. Dana clarified he was an old friend. Peter shouted he would see her Thursday and apologized to the Violinist about not getting to meet him. Peter added he was glad the Violinist was feeling much better but thought he still looked very pale and suggested a little sun. The Violinist asked what Peter did. Dana told him Peter was a scientist. Peter copied a roller skater and spun around.\n\nOn Thursday night, Peter bought flowers and took a cab to 550 Central Park West. As Peter went on his way to see Dana and take her out on a date, he noticed a commotion at the entrance to the building and at the apartment of Dana's neighbor Louis. Peter asked a police officer what happened. A police officer stopped taking statements from the Doorman and a neighbor and remarked some moron brought a cougar to a party, and it went berserk. Peter knocked on Dana's door. Dana answered but she was possessed by Zuul. He noticed that that she had undergone a radical change and was now acting very strangely. She had wild hair and wore a bright red dress. He commented that was a different look for her. She asked Peter if he was the Keymaster. Peter replied he was not, not that he knew of. She slammed the door in his face. He tried to look through peephole then he knocked again. She opened the door again and asked if he was the Keymaster. Peter lied he was and made his way inside Dana's apartment. He lied he was a friend of his and he told him to meet him at her apartment. He inquired about her name. She stated she was Zuul, the Gatekeeper, and they must prepare for the coming of Gozer, \"The Destructor\". Peter replied, \"Oh...\" and noticed slime seeping through the kitchen door and furniture. He asked if they were still going out. He suggested she pick up the place if she was expecting someone. The possessed Dana quickly led Peter to the bedroom where she tried to seduce him asking him \"Do you want this body?\" which he rebuked asking if it was a trick question. The possessed Dana was unrelenting in her seduction, telling Peter \"Take me now subcreature.\" Peter quipped they never talked anymore. Dana grabbed him and pulled him down on the bed. He told her to take it easy and he made it a rule never to get involved with possessed people. She passionately kissed him. Peter clarified it was more of a guideline than a rule. She rolled him over on top of her telling him \"I want you inside me\". Peter told her she already had two people inside her already. Peter broke off and went off the bed. She sat up. He urged her to just quit trying to upset and disturb him and to relax. He fixed her skirt and covered her legs then pushed her back down on her back and instructed her to put her hands on her chest. He asked to talk to Dana. She stated there was no Dana, only Zuul. Peter refused to believe that and kept asking for Dana. Peter proceeded to try to talk to the real Dana Barrett, ignoring her seductive advances in the process. While asking for Dana, an inhuman growling voice replied that \"There is no Dana, only Zuul\". Peter gave Zuul to the count of three to leave Dana's body to which she responded by turning her eyes white, thrashing her head back and forth on her bed then growling furiously like a beast at him and levitating above her bed. Peter, realizing the seriousness of Dana's condition, pleaded with her to come down. Zuul suddenly roared. He recoiled. He sedated her and called Egon to explain what was going on.\n\nPeter announced he had some news from the world of Gozer. Dana was asleep on her bed but panting hard. Egon asked Peter what it was. Peter informed Egon he was with Dana and Gozer made some moves on his would-be girlfriend. Egon asked how she was doing. Peter quipped he thought they could get her a guest shot on Wild Kingdom then revealed he just whacked her up with about 300 cc's of Thorazine. Peter was sitting on the floor of Dana's bedroom. His coat jacket was off and his sleeves were rolled up to his elbows. Peter noted she was saying she was the Gatekeeper and asked Egon if that made any sense to him. Egon revealed he just met the Keymaster. Peter thought that was wonderful and they should get them together. Egon thought that would be extraordinarily dangerous. Peter relented and advised Egon to hold onto the Keymaster and he would head back to the Firehouse. Egon liked the idea and hung up. Peter held Dana's left wrist and checked her pulse. Peter spoke to Dana like she was listening and declared he had to go to work. He asked her to stay in bed until he came back then kissed her left shoulder.\n\nOn Friday morning, Peter returned to the Firehouse in a cab. Peter noticed various official vehicles parked by the entrance. Peter went to the basement. He softly patted the Police Captain on the back, introduced himself and tried to defuse the situation by stressing it was a slight misunderstanding and he would cooperate in any way that he could. Walter Peck was not buying it and pointed out he had his chance to cooperate but chose to have fun and be insulting. Peck declared it was his turn. Egon informed Peter that Peck wanted to shut down the protection grid. Peter quickly stated they were not going to be held responsible. Peter and Peck began talking at the same time. Peck told him they were going to be held responsible. Peter disagreed. Peck ordered the Con Edison Man to shut it off. Peck walked to the Con Edison man. Peter told him not to and warned him. The Con Edison worker pointed out he never saw anything like the Containment Unit before and he was unsure. Peck was not interested in his opinion and told him to just shut it off. With unease on his face, he turned to walk to the control panels. Peter got in the Con Edison Man's face and told him not to be a jerk. The police captain leaned in and made space between the two. The captain ordered Peter to step aside. Peck told the captain if he did that again, he could shoot him. The captain took offense to being told how to do his job. Peter thanked the captain. Peck yelled at the Con Edison worker to shut the grid off. Peter looked over to Egon. Egon stepped away and mimed an explosion with his fingers and mouthed \"Boom.\" Peter, Egon, and Janine made their way to the stairs. The Con Edison Man pulled a gray lever down. The lights dimmed and several alarms went off. The red light above the Containment Unit flashed. The walls of the basement rumbled. Peck backed away. Steam erupted from between the bricks. Everyone ran outside. The roof exploded and a pink beam of psychokinetic energy streamed out of the hole in the Firehouse's roof. Peter shielded his face and exclaimed.\n\nRay and Winston arrived and were given the short version of what happened. Peter asked where the Keymaster went. Egon swore and could not believe they lost him. The Ghostbusters were about to take off in search of Louis but Peck, the Police Captain and some police officers barred their way. Peck wanted the Ghostbusters arrested. He told the captain they were in criminal violation of the Environmental Protection Act, and the explosion was a direct result of it. Egon exclaimed, \"Your mother!\" in response then lunged forward and grabbed Peck's collar. Peter chimed in and asked if the police heard what Peck called him. The Ghostbusters were arrested and put in the NYPD Lock-Up. Ray and Egon looked over their research about 550 Central Park West. Peter surprised the other inmates curious about Ray and Egon's conversation. Peter asked if everybody was getting it so far but he had no clue what the big deal was. He surmised they just did not make them like they used to. Ray slapped the side of Peter's head and exclaimed nobody ever made buildings like it. He assumed the architect was either a certified genius or an authentic wacko, then shook his head. Peter implored Ray to pretend for a moment that he knew nothing about metallurgy, engineering or physics and to just tell him what the hell was going on. Peter looked Ray right in the eyes. Ray teased he never studied. Peter grinned. Ray explained the whole building was a huge super conductive antenna that was designed and built expressly for the purpose of pulling in and concentrating spiritual turbulence. Ray lifted his blueprints off the table and pointed at the one under. Peter was kneeling down looking at them. Ray told him \"his girlfriend\" lived in the corner penthouse of \"Spook Central.\" Peter stood back up. Peter stated she was not his girlfriend and claimed to find her interesting because she was a client and because she slept above her covers. He clarified four feet above her covers and she barked, drooled, and clawed. The inmates exchanged looks.\n\nEgon predicted something terrible was about the enter their world and the Shandor Building was obviously the door. Egon revealed the architect's name was Ivo Shandor. He found the name in Tobin's Spirit Guide. Shandor was also a doctor who performed a lot of unnecessary surgery and then in 1920, he founded a secret society. Peter guessed they were Gozer worshipers. Egon confirmed. Peter teased Ray with \"No studying.\" Ray made a face. Egon continued and revealed after the First World War, Shandor decided that society was too sick to survive the cult conducted rituals up on the roof intended to bring about the end of the world. Egon concluded the end of the world may actually happen. Peter suddenly broke out into song, \"So be good, for goodness sake! Whoa! Somebody's coming!\" Ray stated the obvious, they had to get out of jail and find a judge or something. Winston stepped and told them to hold it. He wanted to clarify their plan was to go before a federal judge and say that some moldy Babylonian god was going to drop in on Central Park West and start tearing up the city. Egon corrected him about Gozer: it was a Sumerian god, not Babylonian. Peter joked that was a big difference. Winston told them no offense, but he was going get his own lawyer. A Jail Guard called the Ghostbusters and revealed Mayor Lenny wanted to see them because the city was going crazy. Peter told the inmates he had to split because the Mayor wanted to rap with him about some things.\n\nWalter Peck forcibly walked between Peter and Ray to the Mayor and introduced himself then declared he was prepared to make a full report: the Ghostbusters were consummate snowball artists, used sensitive nerve gases to induce hallucinations to make people think they were seeing ghosts so they called them, who conveniently showed up to deal with the problem with a fake electronic light show. Ray stated everything was fine with their system until the power grid was shut off by dickless. Peck quickly blurted out they caused the explosion. The Mayor asked them if that was true. Peter admitted it was true, and instead insulted Peck that he had no dick. Peck lunged at Peter. The police officers and the others stepped in and quickly held Peck back to kept them apart until they told everyone to break it up. Peck relented. Peter retorted that was what he heard. The Archbishop stated that officially, the Church was not taking any position on the religious implications of the phenomena occurring then revealed his personal opinion, it was a sign from God. He teased not to quote him on that. Peter quipped that was a smart move. Peter invited the Mayor to believe \"Mr. Pecker.\" Peck clarified his last name was \"Pack.\" Peter continued and stated his other choice was to accept the fact that the city was headed for a disaster of biblical proportions. The Mayor asked what he meant by \"biblical.\" Ray clarified he was taking about \"Old Testament biblical\" and \"real wrath-of-God-type\" stuff. Peter agreed. Ray threw out some examples: fire and brimstone coming from the skies and rivers and seas boiling. Egon added 40 years of darkness, earthquakes, and volcanoes. Winston added the dead rising from the grave. The Mayor stood. Peter stressed there would be human sacrifice, dogs and cats living together, then mass hysteria. The Mayor exclaimed that was enough and he got the point. He asked what if they were wrong. Peter promised if nothing happened, they would back go to jail peacefully and quietly and they would enjoy it. Peter started his pitch and pointed out if he was right, and they could stop the end of the world, the Mayor will be credited with saving the lives of millions of registered voters. The Mayor understood the implications and smiled at his advice. The Archbishop also smiled and nodded in approval as well. Peck expressed his concern over seriously considering listening to them. The Mayor thought. Peter smiled smugly and signaled with his eyes. The Mayor finally pointed at Peck and ordered him out of the office. Peter waved goodbye to Peck. A humiliated Peck childishly swore revenge at Peter and the Ghostbusters for his dismissal. The Mayor's aide and an officer walked Peck to the door as Peter quipped he was going to get Peck a nice fruit basket and joked that he was going to miss him. Peck relented and left. The Mayor turned around from the map and looked at the Ghostbusters. He asked them what they needed from him.\n\nThe Ghostbusters were released and escorted to Dana's building by a police and army motorcade as a dark cloud started to cover the entire city. Peter addressed the crowd behind the police barricades with a hearty hello. Peter shook some hands, leaned in for kisses, and gave high fives. Peter rose Ray's hand high up and asked everyone to acknowledge him. He called Ray \"the heart of the Ghostbusters.\" Ray waved at the crowd. Peter thanked them and told Ray they loved him. Peter walked down the sidewalk. He shook more hands. He told someone he liked their shirt. A redheaded man cheered them on. Peter told the crowd he had to run and had a date with a ghost. He instructed the others to be professionals whatever happens. An earthquake struck and the street nearly trapping the Ghostbusters in a hole amid rubble. They climbed out relatively unscathed. Peter assured the crowd they were fine and they could handle it. The crowd chanted, \"Ghostbusters!\" over and over. Peter asked the others if they wanted to play rough. They huddled up, performed a hand-stack, and ran into the Shandor Building. Some time later, they groaned and panted as they climbed the stairs. There were still many more flights to go. Peter asked where they were. Ray estimated they were in the teens somewhere. Peter requested to be told when they got to the twentieth floor so he could throw up. They made it to what was left of Dana's apartment. Ray noticed the new set of stairs and pointed at it. He asked where they went. Peter stated the obvious, they went up. Peter was about to walk through the passage that was concealed by the wall and refrigerator but lightning went off. Peter motioned everyone to go ahead.\n\nThe Ghostbusters made it to the top of the building. However, they were too late to stop Dana and Louis from summoning Gozer and transforming into their possessors' Terror Dog forms. Peter remarked, \"Okay, so she's a dog.\" Gozer arrived. Peter remarked whatever it was, it had to get by them. Ray agreed. Peter told Ray to go get her. Ray silently realized he fell for it. Peter gave him a nod. Ray took several steps up then addressed Gozer by name and stated that as a duly designated representative of the city, county and state of New York, he ordered it to cease any and all supernatural activity and return forthwith to its place of origin or to the nearest convenient parallel dimension. Peter was satisfied and thanked Ray. Gozer asked Ray if he was a god. Peter nodded \"yes\" to Ray. Ray replied, \"No.\" Gozer blasted them across the roof. Peter declared this chick was toast. They marched up to the Temple of Gozer side by side. Peter asked them if they got their stick. They took out their particle throwers and yelled, \"Holding!\" Gozer crouched down and snarled. Peter shouted, \"Heat 'em up!\" They switched on the throwers then shouted \"Smoking!\" Peter yelled, \"Make 'em hard!\" They shouted, \"Ready!\" Peter declared they were going to show \"prehistoric bitch\" how they did things downtown. He gave the word. They fired at Gozer. It growled then double flipped across the air. It landed on the altar outside the structure. Peter remarked she was a nimble little minx. Egon suggested they better go full stream. They blasted her again. Gozer simply vanished. Peter quipped that was not so hard. Ray concluded they neutronized it and caused a complete particle reversal. Winston proclaimed, \"And we have the tools. We have the talent!\" Peter declared it was \"Milla time!\" An earthquake rocked the temple.\n\nThe disembodied voice of Gozer made its presence known and listed its titles then ordered them to choose and perish. The Ghostbusters stood up. Ray asked Gozer to clarify. Gozer explained they had to choose the form of the Destructor. Peter understood and found it cute. He explained to the others whatever they thought of like J. Edgar Hoover, J. Edgar Hoover would appear and destroy them. He told everyone to empty their heads and not think of anything. They had one shot. Gozer declared the choice was made. Peter protested. He asked Egon. Egon thought of nothing. He asked Winston. Winston asserted his mind was totally blank. Peter stated he chose nothing. Peter, Egon, and Winston turned and looked at Ray. Ray took a few steps back. Ray insisted he couldn't help it and it just popped in there. Peter inquired what he thought of. Ray tried to explain himself. Peter pressed him about what he chose. Soon, Gozer's Destructor Form, the Stay Puft Marshmallow Man, made its presence known. Peter remarked that was not something you see every day. Ray insisted he tried to think of the most harmless thing. He picked something he loved from his childhood, something that could never, ever possibly destroy the world. Peter sarcastically complimented Ray's line of thinking. Ray remembered he used to roast Stay Puft Marshmallows by the fire at Camp Waconda. Peter told Egon that Ray had gone \"bye-bye\" and asked him what he had left. Egon apologized and admitted he was terrified beyond the capacity for rational thought. Stay Puft approached 550 Central Park West and stepped on the Holy Trinity Lutheran Church next door. Peter exclaimed nobody stepped on a church in his town. Ray hesitantly cued everyone to fire on three. They blasted down at Stay Puft. They only succeeded in lighting him on fire. Stay Puft clung to the side of the Shandor Building and climbed up.\n\nRay tried to make light of their impending death by a hundred-foot marshmallow man. Peter riffed and pointed out Stay Puft was a sailor in New York, they just had to get him laid and there would not be any trouble. Egon had a radical idea. He noted the door swings both ways and as a result they could reverse the particle flow through the gate. Ray asked how. Egon proposed they cross the streams. Peter recalled Egon's warning about doing that. Peter pointed out they would be in grave danger along with their client, the nice lady who paid them in advance before she became a dog. Egon revealed there was definitely a very slim chance they would survive. They exchanged looks. Peter stared at Egon. Egon raised an eyebrow. Peter gave Ray a friendly slap to the face. Peter declared he loved the plan and was excited to be a part of it. Winston grumbled the job was definitely not worth another eleven-five a year. They ran to the Temple of Gozer.\n\nPeter told Ray he would see him on the other side. Peter opened fire into the Temple of Gozer, past its open doors. Ray told Peter it was nice working with him. Ray fired, too, and they crossed their streams. Egon and Winston joined in and crossed their streams into Peter and Ray's. The plan worked and the particle flow was reversed and forced the door to Gozer's dimension to close but an explosion was triggered. The Ghostbusters ceased fire and ran off screaming. The roof and top floors of the building blew up and destroyed the Stay Puft Marshmallow Man. Ray, Winston, and Egon came to covered in marshmallow residue. Peter came over to them but had very little marshmallow residue on him. They surveyed the damage and saw a charred Terror Dog husk. Ray blurted out that it smelled like barbecued dog hair. He realized his grievous error and apologized to Peter. Peter was melancholy. He turned and looked at Ray then walked away. Part of the statue's arm chipped off and fingers reached out. The claw fell off. Peter turned around. Dana groaned. Ray got everyone's attention. The Ghostbusters broke open the statue with their hands and Peter lifted Dana out. Louis, with a Terror Dog statue head on his head, walked around helplessly asking if somebody turned out the lights. Peter told the others to check on him. Dana was in a daze and asked where she was. Dana noticed Peter. The crowds cheered for the Ghostbusters. Peter and Dana kissed. Peter mimicked being overwhelmed. Dana shook the hand of a civilian then walked back to Peter amazed. He gestured her to Ecto-1. Peter escorted Dana into the car. A priest blessed Peter. Ray drove Ecto-1 carefully into position then took off. Peter high-fived a few from the front passenger seat.\n\nBetween Ghostbusters (1984) and Ghostbusters II[]\n\nDespite saving the town from Gozer, the Ghostbusters were put out of business due to being sued for all the damage that was done during the battle. Also, Peter and Dana's relationship faltered due to his fear of commitment and taking her for granted. He started to introduce her to others as the \"old ball and chain.\" However, whenever Dana brought up marriage Peter would pretend to be asleep.[4] She ended the relationship but it wasn't on good terms.[5] Dana got married and had a child. Peter and Dana lost touch.[6] Dana and her husband had some issues and he \"ditched\" her for an opportunity at an orchestra in London leaving her and his son behind. Dana considered giving Peter a call.[7] In the years since, Egon observed Peter was \"borderline\" until he eventually, \"crossed the border.\"[8] Peter became the host of a psychic reality talk show, The World of the Psychic, in the years after the Gozer battle.\n\nGhostbusters II[]\n\nIn later 1989, Peter chatted with his two guests on a darkened TV studio set and claimed a father encouraged his children to wash their hair with something of their own. The theme for The World of the Psychic, \"Young Man's Fancy,\" played. The lights came on and recording started on the episode. Peter introduced himself then his first guest, author, lecturer and psychic Milton Angland. Peter immediately talked about Milton's book \"The End of the World\" and asked him if he was willing to reveal the ending. Milton obliged him and predicted the world was going to end at the stroke of midnight on New Year's Eve. Peter inquired if he meant in the current year. Milton confirmed. Peter joked that was cutting it a little bit close. He clarified he meant just from a sales point of view and he was not going to see any paperback sales for at least a year and it would be at least another year he got a mini-series or movie-of-the-week deal. Peter played Devil's Advocate and proposed 1992 instead. Milton told him to wait. Peter settled on 1994 as a better choice. Milton exclaimed and stated the book was not a money-making scheme and he had a strong psychic belief that the world would end on New Year's Eve. Milton pressed his finger to his forehead and began to look visibly shaken. He exhaled and adjusted his coat. Peter's jovial tone shifted back to serious and hoped he was right for his own sake but revealed his other guest Elaine had another date in mind.\n\nElaine stated according to her source, the end of the world would be on February 14, 2016. Peter was bummed that was Valentine's Day. He asked her where she got her date from. Elaine stated she received her information from an alien. She recounted what she told her husband. She had a drink at the bar, alone, in the Paramus Holiday Inn and an alien approached her. The alien started talking to her and bought her a drink. She speculated the alien used some kind of a ray or a mind control device on her then forced her to follow him to his room. Peter stared directly into the camera. Elaine revealed the alien then told her about the end of the world. Peter pursed his lower lip and asked if the alien had a room at the Paramus Holiday Inn. She speculated it could have been a room on the spacecraft made up to look like a room at the Holiday Inn. She was not sure. Peter stood up and walked forward to wrap up the episode. He pointed out the whole problem with aliens was you just could not trust them. He did admit there was occasionally a nice one like Starman and E.T. but usually they turned out to be some kind of big lizard. The World of the Psychic tune started playing. He ended telling viewers that was all the time they had for this week on World of the Psychic then teased next week's episode. He asked for Ira. A crewman handed Peter a bald hairless cat. It meowed. Peter turned his hand around to show the back of the cat, too. He promoted the weird topic of hairless pets. Peter handed the cat back. It meowed. Peter pretended to send a psychic message to the audience then laughed. He turned around and shook Milton's hand.\n\nPeter walked through the backstage offices with his producer Norman. He was not pleased with the two guests and asked what happened to the telekinetic man who bent spoons. Norman informed Peter the telekinetic canceled and they were the best they could do on such short notice. Norman reiterated no respected psychic would come on the show because they thought Peter was a fraud. Peter stated he was a fraud then saw Mayor Lenny, trailed by an entourage. Peter called out to him. Jack Hardemeyer stepped between Peter and the Mayor and gently pushed him away. The Mayor and his entourage continued on. Jack asked how he could help him. Peter replied he could get his hand off him then explained he was an old friend of the mayor's and he wanted to say hello and give him a kiss. Jack introduced himself, revealed his position as the mayor's assistant. He knew who Peter was and joked he did not see any ghosts anywhere. Jack pretended to look around for ghosts. Peter smirked. Peter explained the Ghostbusters performed a \"little job\" for the city a while back and got stiffed on the bill by some bureaucratic bookworm like him. Jack's demeanor changed to a serious one. A police officer stopped to check them out. Jack warned him to stay away from the mayor. He revealed Mayor Lenny was running for governor next fall and the last thing the team needed was for him to be associated with two-bit frauds and publicity hounds like the former Ghostbusters. Jack walked away and left Peter dumbfounded. He added he was a voter and thought that meant he was supposed to lie to him and kiss his butt.\n\nPeter went to Ray's Occult Books and spoke in an accent, jokingly requesting a love potion aerosol that he could spray on a certain Penthouse pet to obtain her total submission. They both greeted Peter. Peter threw his coat onto an empty book cart. He asked Egon how school was and joked those \"science chicks\" must really dig that large cranium of his. Egon believed they were more interested in his epididymis. Peter scoffed then paused in thought. He told Ray to close up so he could buy him a calzone. Ray informed him that he was busy working on something but revealed his book order came in, \"Magical Paths to Fortune and Power\". Peter thanked him. Egon snickered while Peter held his head up high. Egon wished him good luck with that. Peter politely asked Ray to put it on his account. Egon found something else and showed it to Ray. Ray skimmed and agreed. Peter was curious and asked what they were working on. Ray started to answer but from the back of the store, Egon cleared his throat to subtly warn Ray not to blab. Ray told Peter they were checking something out for an old friend. Peter pressed on and asked who the \"old friend\" was. Ray was saved by the phone and answered. He replied to the caller that the store's closing hours were 7:00 on weekdays and midnight on Saturdays. He thanked the caller, hung up and looked back down at his book. Peter placed his left hand under Ray's chin and made him look into his eyes. Peter again asked who. Ray tried to fib and said it was just someone they knew. Peter pretended to be satisfied then pulled on Ray's ears. Egon turned around and could only stand there as Ray screamed. Peter asked again. Ray repeatedly refused to answer but Peter implored him to. Ray finally caved and revealed the client was Dana. Peter was surprised and released him. Ray massaged his ears. Peter couldn't believe the person was his ex-girlfriend.\n\nThe trio headed to Dana's apartment. Egon tried to tell Dana about Peter but Dana pushed the door to close it. Peter slipped in through the door and stopped it. He quipped about giving them one more chance. Ray rubbed his palms. Egon glared at Peter's back. Ray told Dana he tortured him by pulling his ears. Dana greeted Peter. Peter turned to them, modulated his voice to sound deep and sexy. Instead of responding, Dana turned to Egon and asked him what he would like to do first. Egon wanted to start with examining Oscar first. Peter played Dana's cello like a guitar. Egon looked away. Ray also held back. She walked over to him.\n\nPeter inquired what happened to Dana's husband. He claimed he heard he ditched Dana and ran off to Europe. Dana clarified he did not ditch her, they had some problems and he got a very good job offer from an orchestra in London, and he took it. Dana placed her cello back on its stand. Peter held a mini-snow globe upside down. Peter summed that up as being ditched. Peter mused Dana would have been better off marrying him. He held the miniature snow globe upright. Dana recalled he never asked me and whenever she brought it up, he got drowsy and fell asleep. Peter placed the globe back on the shelf and walked away. He declared she never got it. He explained he was a man, he was sensitive, he needed to feel loved and he needed to be desired. Dana placed her left hand on his shoulder. She reminded him she broke up with him when he started introducing her as the old ball and chain. Peter grimaced. Peter admitted he may have a lot of personal problems but he was a total professional when it came to his job. He walked over to Egon and Ray before Dana could get there.\n\nEgon was using a Grafco fetal stethoscope on Oscar as he lay on his back. Ray scanned him with a P.K.E. Meter. Peter got Egon's attention. He looked up at Peter, who spoke up close right into the stethoscope asking what they were doing. He recoiled then told Dana that Oscar seemed to be fine. Dana noted he was very healthy. Peter thought it he looked okay. Dana led Ray to Oscar's bedroom. Egon turned to Peter and handed him a specimen jar and walked away. He asked Peter to acquire a stool specimen. Peter quipped, \"Business or personal?\"\n\nPeter smiled down at Oscar and asked him if he wanted to play with a big kid. He told him he should have been his father. He clarified he could have been. Oscar held out a hand. Peter shook it and replied he understood. He picked Oscar up and started singing \"Dixie.\" Oscar bit him softly on the nose. Peter playfully shouted for help because he had gone completely berserk. Ray, Egon, and Dana heard Peter. Ray and Egon exchanged concern. Dana left the room. Peter's voice returned to normal once he saw Dana. He claimed Oscar had some sort of a clear liquid coming out of his mouth, too. Dana was amused and asked what he thought. Peter thought he was ugly but not Elephant Man ugly. He asked if his father was ugly. She implored Oscar not to listen. Peter joked he stunk, too, and spoke in a Mexican accent. Oscar giggled. Peter played along and asked him if his father was a smelly. He asked him what his name was. Dana told her it was Oscar. Peter lamented how he was named after a hot dog and sympathized. Dana asked him if he seriously found anything unusual. Peter admitted he did not have a lot of experience with babies. He then told Oscar his mama was going get a stool sample. Dana was confused. They laid Oscar down on the table.\n\nRay was lying down his back and swept the underside of Oscar's crib with his P.K.E. Meter when Peter entered. Ray announced he got nothing. Peter asked Egon what was next. Egon wanted to perform some gynecological tests on Dana. Peter joked, \"Who wouldn't?\" Egon proposed they check out the street next. A short time later, Dana showed Peter, Egon, and Ray where the incident happened on First Avenue. She told them how her baby carriage stopped right in the middle of the crosswalk. Peter took charge, dashed into the middle of the street, and started directing traffic. Cars honked at them. Ray tried to tell to stop Peter in vain. Peter told the annoyed motorists they were scientists and to get out of the way. He thanked them. A taxi driver braked and honked. He asked Peter if he was gonna get out of the way. Peter told him to relax and pointed out he was on the meter. Ray and Egon took readings. Ray revealed the P.K.E. Meter got a reading of 1,118. Egon stated he got 2.5 GEVs on the Giga meter. Dana asked them what that meant. Ray and Egon exchanged looks.\n\nMany hours later, now well into the evening, at the same spot on First Avenue, Egon was dressed like a road worker and used a jackhammer. The First Cop asked him why he was cutting. Peter and Ray exited Libby's Coffee Shop and exchanged looks. Egon repeated his question. The officer was waiting for an answer. Egon called out to the \"boss\" and gestured at them to come over. They walked back over to Egon. Peter spoke in a thick stereotypical accent of a blue collar man. Peter asked Egon who told him to stop cutting. The officer repeated himself again. Peter turned to the First Cop and played along, asking him if he told Egon to stop cutting. The officer confirmed that and repeated himself. Peter stalled with rhetoricals and pointed out they let the police work. Ray emulated Peter's blue collar impression. Ray explained they were working overtime because \"some diaper bag downtown\" was being a jerk and making them work on a Friday night. Peter agreed. He asked Egon. Egon shouted, \"Yo!\" They all giggled. The officer capitulated and told them to take it easy. The squad car drove away. Ray asked Egon what he had been doing. Egon was incensed and pointed out that while they were getting coffee for an hour, he dug a big hole in the middle of the street. Ray looked down the hole in amazement and gathered Egon uncovered an old air shaft that went on and on. Egon took readings with the Giga Meter while Ray aimed his flashlight down the hole. Egon remarked it was very intense and suggested they get a deeper reading. Ray agreed. They stood back up. Egon noted someone had to go down there. Ray agreed. Ray looked up and realized Peter and Egon were staring at him.\n\nWhile Ray went down the hole, the same police squad car from before returned along with another vehicle. A Con Edison Supervisor asked Peter and Egon what was going on. Peter shifted back to his blue collar persona and referred to them as boneheads. He claimed three thousand phones were out on Greenwich Village and he had eight million miles of cable to check. He pretended to be displeased they came to shake his monkey tree again. The Con Ed Supervisor pointed out the fact that the phone lines were across the street. Peter improvised and smacked Egon's hard hat angrily. Peter \"blamed\" Egon for setting up in the wrong spot despite his reluctance. The First Cop told Peter to stop. He revealed the checked with Con Ed and the phone company, and confirmed they weren't who they claimed to be. He implored Peter to tell him another lie. Without breaking character, Peter claimed there was major gas leak. He pointed to some steam that happened to be nearby and rhetorically asked them where they thought all this was coming from. Ray made things worse and triggered a city-wide blackout while he was being pulled up.\n\nPeter, Egon, and Ray's trial was held at the Thurgood Marshall U.S. Courthouse. Judge Stephen Wexler issued a warning the law does not recognize the existence of ghosts and he did not believe in them either. Jack looked over to Peter and snickered. He walked over to gloat and listed off the charges: violating a judicial restraining order, willful destruction of public property, fraud, and malicious mischief. He joked he would see Peter in a couple of years, at his first parole hearing. Peter retorted they would never take them alive. Later in the trail, Louis, their lawyer, examined Peter. It was extremely obvious Peter was feeding Louis his lines. Louis repeated that Peter was just trying to help out a friend, who was scared of what was happening to her. He asked Peter to say it again. Louis continued there was no evil intended. Judge Wexler stared at them. Louis continued if you live in a place you love, you do not want anything bad to happen. He called it an isolated incident that would not happen again. The Prosecutor objected over Louis leading the witness. Wexler approved the objection. Wexler asked Louis if he had any questions for the witness that might have some bearing on the case. Louis asked Peter. Peter told him no, and they helped them out enough already. Louis told Wexler he had no more questions.\n\nLouis walked back to his seat but half turned to the Prosecutor and told her Peter was hers. She asked Peter to please tell the court why it is that he and his co-defendants took it upon themselves to dig a very big hole in the middle of First Avenue. Peter dryly joked there were so many holes in First Avenue, they really did not think anyone would have noticed. The gallery laughed. Judge Wexler banged his gavel. He warned Peter he would find him in contempt if he kept it up. The Psychomagnotheric Slime in the beaker bubbled. Peter apologized. The Prosecutor repeated her question and reminded him he was under oath. Peter answered there were some things in this world that go way beyond human understanding, things that cannot be explained, things that most people did not even want to know about. He pointed out that was where the Ghostbusters came in. Ray and Egon nodded in agreement. The Prosecutor interpreted his words as a claim that the world of the supernatural was his exclusive province. She leaned on the stand. Peter placed his hands on top of hers. She pulled away. He referred to her as \"Kitten\" and clarified that \"sometimes, shit happens, someone has to deal with it, and who ya gonna call?\" The gallery erupted in cheers and applauded. Egon and Ray turned and looked at the gallery. Judge Wexler banged his gavel and told everyone to shut up.\n\nJudge Wexler ordered Peter, Ray, and Egon to stand. He had to tell Louis to stand, too. They all stood. Wexler found them guilty on all charges and ordered them to pay fines in the amount of $25,000 each. The Psychomagnotheric ectoplasm continued to bubble. Ray finally noticed it and became alarmed. Wexler sentenced them to 18 months in the city correctional facility at Riker's Island. He stated on a more personal note and on the record, he believed there was no place for fakes and charlatans. Egon interrupted him. Wexler told him to shut up and continued tricksters like the Ghostbusters had no place in decent society. Peter stated what they had to say was important. The Psychomagnotheric ectoplasm started bubbling faster. Wexler ignored Peter and accused the Ghostbusters of preying upon the gullibility of innocent people. Ray agreed to get him to stop. Wexler told him to be quiet. Ray tried to tell him but Wexler continued that if his hands were not tied by the unalterable fetters of the law, he would indulge in the tradition of their illustrious forebears. Peter, Ray, and Egon gestured and started to lower themselves to hide under the table. Louis nervously followed suit. The people in the gallery became worried, too. Wexler stated he would reach back, to a purer, sterner justice, and have them burned at the stake. The Psychomagnotheric ectoplasm exploded violently.\n\nThe ghosts of the Scoleri Brothers manifested in front of the judge's bench seated atop electric chairs. Wexler hopped out of his seat just in time and scooted over to Peter, Ray, Egon, and Louis under their table. Wexler identified the ghosts and explained he tried them for murder and sentenced them to death by electric chair. The Scoleri Brothers picked up their table and threw it at the judge's bench. Wexler, Peter, Ray, Egon, and Louis ran behind the glass partition to the judge's door but it was locked. Wexler was visibly scared and shouted at him to do something. Louis stepped him and pointed out his clients were still under a judicial restraining order, the \"blue thing\" he got from The Prosecutor, and if they busted the ghosts, they would be exposing themselves. Peter quipped he did not want them exposing themselves. They peeked around the partition and watched as Nunzio Scoleri carried the Prosecutor by her ankle across the courtroom. Peter told him he was next. Wexler caved. He rescinded the order and dismissed the case.\n\nRay, Egon, and Peter suited up with the Proton Packs laid out on the exhibit table. Peter stumbled around with his pack on to oversell the weight of it. Peter remembered he always hated that part of the business. Peter noted it had been a couple of years since they last used the equipment. He hoped it still worked. Egon stated the packs should still work since the power cells had a half-life of five thousand years. Peter turned on the switch on his thrower and in reaction to the sound, sang \"Do,\" Ray followed with his thrower, sang \"Ri,\" Egon turned on his, and sang \"Egon!\" Peter looked at Egon in disbelief. Egon grinned. The chairs in the gallery started to bounce around. Egon, Ray, and Peter stood their ground waiting for the ghosts to reappear. The Scoleri Brothers popped up. The three fired wildly at them and missed. The Scoleri Brothers flew away through the wall behind the judge's bench. Peter yelled. Peter, then Ray, then Egon all laughed. Louis started to calm down but freaked out when the Scoleri Brothers came back. Peter fired at Nunzio in the gallery. He walked past the bar and snagged him. Peter goaded him and declared he was going to take him home to his \"private zoo.\"\n\nRay soon wrangled Tony Scoleri. Peter backed out of the gallery with Nunzio. Egon instructed Ray to hold Tony and then told Peter to start bringing Nunzio back. Peter continued teasing Nunzio's figure. Egon pushed the Trap across the floor. The Scoleri Brothers were pulled into the Trap. Ray declared, \"Two in the box!\" Egon followed with, \"Ready to go!\" Peter started with, \"We be fast...\" and all three shouted, \"...and they be slow!\" Louis came over and looked at the Trap in awe. Peter, Egon, and Ray triumphantly strode out of the courtroom. Louis held out the Trap. Reporters swarmed around them. Peter announced they were the best, the beautiful, and the only Ghostbusters. Ray declared they were back. The Ghostbusters business was revived and they became busy with cases again.\n\nEgon, Peter, Ray, and Winston jogged down a street suited up as Ghostbusters again. The Ghostbusters caught a ghost in Record Explosion at 2 Broadway and exited with Santa hats on and were in charcoal jumpsuits. Egon held a smoking Trap. Peter held the Latent Image Sensor. A Jogger Ghost ran the jogger's route around the Jacqueline Kennedy Onasis Reservoir in the northern part of Central Park. Living joggers screamed in fright and hopped out of its way. Ray, with his Ecto Goggles on, gave Peter the signal. Peter, who sat on a bench reading the newspaper, stomped the pedal. A Trap was buried in the ground just barely visible for it to open. The ghost ran right over it and was trapped. Peter bid the ghost goodbye. Peter and Ray danced in celebration. During another case, Ray drove Ecto-1a way too quickly and erratically heading to Barrow Street. Peter and Egon exchanged worried looks. Peter looked at Ray from the back. The Ghostbusters were called to Orrefors on 58 East 57th Street. Peter looked over at a female employee. Several mounted devices bearing the caution stripe motif were placed around floating fine crystals and activated. The fine crystal coming came crashing to the ground and cases below and shattered.\n\nAfter case, the Ghostbusters, in their charcoal suits, returned to Ecto-1a at East 57th Street and Park Avenue. Winston and Peter held a Trap each. On another case, the Ghostbusters jogged through traffic at a stand still with their throwers ready. After another, they handed Janine was handed two smoking Traps and left for another call. A new commercial was filmed. Winston mentioned the Ghostbusters' special half-price service plan. Peter's role was to feign surprise at such an offer.\n\nThe Ghostbusters gathered around a table on the second floor of the Firehouse. Egon and Ray demonstrated what they discovered about the Psychomagnotheric slime. Peter jokingly asked if he should get spoons. Egon told him not to bother and cued Ray to demonstrate their discovery. They both angrily shouted at the ectoplasm and insulted it. Winston and Peter looked at each other. Winston stopped Ray mid-insult. Egon flashed his hands to stop. Peter asked them if this is what they did with their spare time. Ray pointed out it was an incredible breakthrough, the discovery of a psychoreactive substance. He explained it reacted to human emotional states. Peter nicknamed it \"Mood slime.\" Egon revealed they were running tests to see if they could get an equally strong positive reaction. Peter inquired what kind of tests they performed. Ray carefully replied they sang to it and told it supportive, nurturing things. Peter got to the point and wanted to know they were not sleeping with it. There was an awkward silence and sense of uneasiness from Ray and Egon. Peter and Winston teased them. Winston remarked it was always the quiet ones. Peter called Ray a hound.\n\nEgon suggested a demonstration of the kinetic test. He took a toaster from the kitchen counter and stated it was an ordinary household one. Peter quipped he was taking him for his word on that. Ray placed some of the ectoplasm into the toaster with a spoon. Egon placed the toaster on the billiards table. Ray explained the ectoplasm responded to music so they tried easy listening, middle-of-the-road type stuff like Paul Young and \"Dust In The Wind.\" Peter joked it worked for him. Egon revealed it loved Jackie Wilson. Jackie Wilson's \"(Your Love Has Lifted Me) Higher and Higher\" was played. Peter kept joking and asked them if this was what they did at night when he was not around the Firehouse. He joked he thought the toaster sounded exactly like Jackie. Egon told him to just watch. Peter asked if it could do Emmylou Harris. The toaster hopped up. Peter realized it danced, too. The toaster moved around like it was dancing. Peter hugged the toaster and happily declared it was his number one Christmas boutique gift item. Winston was suspicious it would eat someone's hand the minute someone got mad. Peter stated they would put a warning label on it for liability reasons then recoiled in pain. Egon quickly took the toaster away. It was just a prank. Peter gestured like he poked Egon's eyes and relished how easily they fell for it. Ray screamed as they tussled playfully.\n\nSome time later, Peter went to the Manhattan Museum of Art. He stopped at the guard's station in the museum. He greeted Rudy the Museum Guard and stated he was looking for Dana. Rudy told him to go to Room 304, Restoration. Peter thanked him. Rudy realized he was Dr. Venkman from \"The World of the Psychic\" and Peter perked up. Rudy stood up and shook Peter's hand. He claimed he was a \"big, big fan.\" Peter thanked him for the kind words. Rudy revealed World of the Psychic used to be one of his two favorite shows. Peter was curious what the other one was. Rudy told him it was \"Bass Masters\" and explained it was a fishing show. Peter noted he knew \"Bass Masters\" and continued on.\n\nPeter entered the restoration room and found Dana cleaning a painting. He pulled the easel away and took a look. He complimented her work and her eyes. Dana corrected him. She did not paint it, she was just cleaning the Gauguin. Peter pretended he knew the artist. Janosz Poha arrived and asked to be introduced. Dana presented Janosz to Peter and emphasized he was the head of the Restoration department as more of a warning. Instead of shaking Peter's hand, Janosz touched it. Peter looked at Dana and slowly wiped his hand across his sweater. Janosz admitted he saw Peter on TV and enjoyed his exploits. He joked he hoped Peter was not there on business. Peter wiped his hand on his sweater again. Peter quipped his reasons were top-secret. He saw the Vigo painting and went over to it, remarking he had a Gauguin, too.\n\nJanosz informed Peter he was preparing the portrait for the new Romantic exhibition and it was of Prince Vigo, the ruler of Carpathian and Moldavia. Peter imitated Vigo's pose, to Dana's amusement then remarked Vigo was a bit of a sissy. Janosz stated he was a very powerful magician and a genius in many ways. Dana added he was also a lunatic and a genocidal madman. She hated the painting and felt uncomfortable ever since it came up from storage. Peter theorized she was probably feeling what Vigo was: Carpathian kitten loss. He missed his kitten. Dana smiled while Peter grabbed some paint and pretended to add one by the castle. Janosz stood between Peter and Vigo. He was naturally put off by the suggestion of altering valuable artwork and believed it was time for him to go. He declared the joyfulness was over. Dana tried to tell him Peter was just kidding around. Peter noted he was not going to get a green card with that attitude. Peter walked away and turned to Dana. He jested she was sweet on the hunky stud. Dana admitted every now and then, she got the feeling that painting was watching her and even smiling at her. They noticed Janosz talking to Vigo and gesturing to them. They exchanged looks of concern.\n\nIn the evening, Peter was stirred out his slumber on the couch in his apartment by frantic pounding on the door and a baby's cries. Dana yelled it was her and pleaded to be let in. Peter wondered what was going on. She continued shouting. Peter opened the door. Dana came in. She was in a coat with Oscar inside. She was frantic and uttered she did not know where else to go then told him the bathtub was trying to eat Oscar. She cuddled Oscar. Peter tried to comfort her and told her she was all right. Dana told Oscar she would not let it get him. Peter assured her she was safe. Dana admitted she was terrified. Peter repeated she was all right now and took his coat off then threw it towards his couch. He told her to sit down and relax while he got them some clothes. Peter went to his phone, dialed, and closed the door. Ray answered. Peter told him Dana came over to his place. There was a pause. He informed Ray her tub tried to eat her.\n\nRay asked if he was serious then got excited then backpedaled to say what happened was terrible but great for their research. Peter cut him off. Ray promised they would get right on it. Peter briefed Dana on what was going to happen next: Ray and Egon were going to check out her apartment. Peter presented a green sweatshirt. He told Oscar he held onto it for a long time and got it from a girl who got it from Joe Namath. He joked they did want to know how she got it then fashioned it into a diaper. He told Oscar he would appreciate it if he refrained from hosing it down with his own personal rinse. He suggested he start practicing a thing the big guys liked to call \"self control\". He declared he was going to stay at \"Uncle Pete's\" until this thing blew over and it was his place now. They went over to Peter's bedroom. He leaped onto the bed and bounced a few more times then posed and welcomed her inside. Dana asked about the sleeping arrangements. Peter proposed the best option for him was he lie on my side and she spoon up beside him with her arm draped over him. He demonstrated. Peter rolled over into position to demonstrate. She sat down. He countered if it was done the opposite way, he would choke on her hair in the night. She proposed he sleep on the sofa while she and Oscar slept on the bed. He was okay with that idea. She was eager to put him down for the night. Peter asked if he could. She obliged him. Peter told Oscar he was short, his belly button stuck out too far and he was a terrible burden on his poor mother. He pointed at Oscar then waved his finger around. Peter looked inside his refrigerator and groaned in disgust at its contents.\n\nThe next morning, Peter waited outside the Manhattan Museum of Art. Ray revealed there was only some slime residue around the bathtub then shared the info gathered on Vigo character from Leon Zundinger's \"Magicians, Martyrs And Madmen\". Egon stated Vigo the Carpathian was born in 1505 and died in 1610. Peter mentally calculated that was 105 years old and remarked he hung in there. Ray listed off all the ways his subjects tried to kill him. Egon clarified he was not exactly a man of the people then listed off his other titles: Vigo the Cruel, Vigo the Torturer, Vigo the Despised and Vigo the Unholy. Peter joked another was Vigo the Butch. Ray explained there was a prophecy, just before his head died. Vigo's last words were: \"Death is but a door, time is but a window. I'll be back!\"\n\nThe Ghostbusters stepped into the Restoration room. Peter instructed everyone to suck in the guts. They inhaled. Janosz immediately told them to leave. Ray asked Peter who that was. Peter sicced Ray on him. Ray engaged Janosz politely, introducing himself, complimenting the work space, and stating they were doing a routine spook check. Peter handed Janosz his coat. Janosz informed Peter that Dana was not present. Peter knew that. Janosz asked why he came. Peter told him they got a report there was a major creep in the area, so they checked their list and he was right on the top. He asked Janosz where in the hell he was from anyway. Janosz replied he came from the Upper West Side. Egon informed Peter the whole room was extremely hot. Peter snapped photographs like a fashion photographer. Janosz pleaded with Peter to stop and was ignored. Janosz stood in front of the painting and stated no photographs were allowed but slides were available in the gift shop. Winston took him aside. Janosz shrieked. Peter thanked Winston and continued. He asked Vigo to give him angry like he had a bad day and was cranky. Peter was pleased and became more and more intense. He asked for sexy and mused the girls and the guys liked him. He asked about the animals. Ray stood on the step ladder and took readings. He looked at Vigo's eyes and became transfixed. Peter went overboard and yelled at Vigo to destroy him. Egon interrupted him and wanted to talk. Peter turned to Vigo and told him he worked with better, but not many, and thanked him. Peter took his coat from a distraught Janosz.\n\nPeter returned home to his apartment with a suitcase. He called out to Dana. He was horrified upon realized she cleaned up the apartment. Dana was fresh out of the shower and wrapped in a white towel. They greeted each other. Dana alerted him that Oscar was asleep then asked about her apartment. Peter, with a straight face, told her the guys spent the whole night there, went through all her things and personal stuff, tried on some of her clothes, made some long-distance phone calls, and cleaned out the fridge. Dana cut him off and asked if they found anything. Peter conceded they only found a little bit of the pink slime. Dana asked what she was supposed to do now. Peter told her get dressed and get crazy with him on the streets of Manhattan. Dana was not so sure. Peter assured her it was exactly what she needed and he already had a babysitter. Dana was not so sure about leaving Oscar in a strange place with a strange person. Peter pointed out the babysitter was Janine. Dana inquired if Janine had experience babysitting.\n\nPeter handed her a bouquet of flowers and presented a suitcase. He revealed he brought some things from her apartment, a couple of provocative ensembles. Dana agreed they would go out to get dinner but he was not allowed to use any of those old cheap moves on her. Peter promised he would not, he had all new cheap moves. They entered the bedroom to find Oscar awake. Dana baby talked to him. Peter informed Oscar he was going to have the whole place to himself that night and revealed he had some Laura Antonelli tapes around. He asked Dana if she saw some shirts in the \"floor-bed\" area. Dana revealed she placed them in the hamper. Peter was surprised he had a hamper. He took some of the clothes out of the hamper and asked her to tell him the next time she was going to do that. Dana pointed out they were dirty. Peter scoffed and stated he had more than two grades of laundry. He claimed there were many subtle levels. He took one shirt and claimed it could be hung outside the window for twenty minutes and it would be perfectly fine. Peter left the bedroom. Dana commented to Osc"
