        "text": "I lost my virginity because of Bill Murray. Well, no, that might be overstating it. He wasn’t in the room when it happened. But he was in my head, or at least his characters were — those smirking, frumpy goofballs, statues of imperfection. If they could make it work with acne, a paunch and bad posture, surely, I could, too.\n\nI'm in my 50s now and should have long outgrown my Bill Murray phase. But he's more important to me than ever. Middle-aged guys have a weird relationship with Murray. We’ve been alive for roughly as long as he’s been making movies. We’ve grown up with him. And for some of us, he’s guided us through the first century of our lives. Every decade, he’s been right there with movies that were like blueprints for better living.\n\nHere's how Murray has been our Sherpa along the great climb to modern manhood.\n\nPreteens\n\nMurray road map: Meatballs (1979),Caddyshack (1980)\n\nWe’re all Carl, the bumbling groundskeeper in Caddyshack—invisible to the world, incapable of doing the simplest of tasks. Losing is inevitable, and as Tripper reminds us in Meatballs, \"It just doesn’t matter.\" There's something freeing in that, the realization that the gophers and Camp Mohawks in life are probably going to win, so who cares? You can try again tomorrow. Maybe this time with dynamite!\n\nTeens\n\nMurray road map: Stripes (1981), Ghostbusters (1984)\n\nYour body’s changing. You feel weird and unlovable, and you’re covered in slime far more than you’d like to admit. It feels like authority figures are always yelling at you. “We’re mutants,\" Winger reminds his fellow recruits (and, basically, all teenagers) in Stripes. But you'll figure it out, just like Peter Venkman and the other Ghostbusters figured out how to use those unlicensed nuclear accelerators without blowing themselves up. The things you think are flaws may just be your superpowers.\n\nThe 20s\n\nMurray road map: What About Bob? (1991), Groundhog Day (1993)\n\nBeing a smug a__hole like Phil Connors in Groundhog Day isn’t as cute as it was back in high school. It’s time to grow up a little. Be kinder to the people around you. You’re responsible for your days. You can make them happy or sad, full of meaning or more of the same. Take life at your own speed, even if your own speed is baby steps. Enjoy every victory, because they don’t happen all that often. Do things that terrify you, even if you have to be tied to a boat mast with rope to find the courage. It wasn’t pretty, but you did it. You’re sailing! You’re a sailor now! Ahoy!\n\nThe 30s\n\nMurray road map: Lost in Translation (2003), The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou (2004)\n\nNot living up to your own expectations? Join the club. Am I ever going to be good again? Steve Zissou wondered to himself. Spoiler alert: you will. Maybe don't take so many business trips away from your family. Be more forgiving with your spouse. Like Bob Harris in Lost in Translation said, if your marriage is barely older than a teenager, it can technically drive a car \"but there's still the occasional accident.”\n\nStop flirting with younger women. Stick with the ones your own age, as they're more likely to save you from pirates. Also, that metaphorical shark you're after, even if you find it, it's not going to make you happy.\n\nThe 40s and 50s"
