        "text": "By the end of the year I'm sure all four of the original Ghostbusters will be asked about this. Ever since the news broke in early September that a third Ghostbusters movie was being written, journalists have been scrambling for any morsel of info that they can. Bill Murray was the most recent to be asked about the sequel and gave a rather interesting update to journalists this past weekend in New York City (via SciFi). In addition to mentioning that \"the third one could happen,\" Murray told a rather discouraging story about how Ghostbusters II came about. \"The second one was kind of disappointing,\" he explained, because the idea that was pitched originally was changed entirely by the time he got to set to start work.\n\nAs was later confirmed, \"The Office\" writers Lee Eisenberg and Gene Stupnitsky have been hard at work on a script. Murray himself confirms \"there's two fellows from 'The Office' that are writing a script, but I've yet to see it.\" Murray's not involved yet, \"but it's possible,\" he says. \"It's a great idea that they hired these two guys to do it, because I think... it could be a fresh look at it. And it could be funny.\" We've also already heard from Dan Aykroyd and Harold Ramis previously, which leaves Ernie Hudson and Ivan Reitman as the only guys missing. As for that story about Ghostbusters II, let's just let Murray tell it himself.\n\n\"We did a sequel, and it was sort of rather unsatisfying for me, because the first one to me was the goods,\" Murray said. \"It was the real thing. And the sequel, you know, was ... it was a few years later. There was an idea pitched. And it was like, well, they got us all together in a room. We just laughed for a couple of hours. And then they said, 'What if we did another one? Here's an idea.'\"\n\nMurray added, \"So they had this idea, but it didn't turn out to be the idea when I arrived on the set. They'd written a whole different movie than the one [initially discussed]. And the special-effects guys got it and got their hands on it. And it was just not the same movie. There were a few great scenes in it, but it wasn't the same movie. So there's never been an interest in a third Ghostbusters because the second one was kind of disappointing ... for me, anyway.\"\n\nSo that second movie wasn't actually the one that we were originally supposed to see? I don't know about everyone else, but I grew up a bigger fan of the second one than the original. Maybe it's because it had the creepy guy in the painting and that crazy pink ooze that brought the Statue of Liberty to life. Anyway, getting back to Ghostbusters 3, as I said earlier in the Sunday Discussion, this reboot of the franchise may only be as good as we're all hoping if Judd Apatow gets involved. And even if they switch the story up to focus on a younger group of kids, all the original guys need to come back - there's no question about that. Thankfully it sounds like they will all return - from Aykroyd to Hudson to Murray to Ramis."
