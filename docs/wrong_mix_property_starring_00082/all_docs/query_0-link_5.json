        "text": "<!–[CDATA[You can still apparently call on Bill Murray for some old-fashioned ghost busting.\n\nThe actor will appear in Sony's upcoming \"Ghostbusters\" reboot, Variety has confirmed. Details on his role have not yet been revealed.\n\nMurray starred in the original \"Ghostbusters\" that debuted in 1984, playing Dr. Peter Venkman. He would go on to reprise the role in 1989's \"Ghostbusters II.\"\n\nMurray previously reacted hesitantly to the idea of a new \"Ghostbusters,\" telling David Letterman that rumors of his involvement in the film were \"crazy talk.\"\n\nAnother previous Ghostbuster will also appear in the film. Dan Aykroyd revealed last month that he shot a scene for the reboot.\n\nPaul Feig directs Sony's \"Ghostbusters,\" starring Kristin Wiig, Melissa McCarthy, Kate McKinnon, Leslie Jones, Chris Hemsworth, Michael K. Williams and Neil Casey. It's set to debut July 22, 2016."
