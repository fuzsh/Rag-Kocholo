        "text": "Peter Mosen of Walden is known among Ghostheads (fans of the movie “Ghostbusters”) as the “original Ghosthead.” He not only dresses the part but has a cameo appearance in “Ghostbusters II.” You will spot him in the restaurant scene where he and his date are slimed. Sigourney Weaver and Bill Murray are sitting at a table behind him.\n\nIt all started in 1984, when the posters came out for the “Ghostbuster” movie, even before the movie came out. “There was just something about it,” Mosen said. “I tried to win passes to the screening, looked at the poster and saw Bill Murray and Dan Aykroyd and thought that these were the two funniest guys on 'Saturday Night Live.' This is going to be a funny movie.”\n\nHe looked at the costumes on the poster and realized that his friend had found a jumpsuit in a dumpster that looked just like the ones they were wearing. He did some detail work and made a replica Proton Pak, the very first. Executives at the screening spotted him, thought he looked like Aykroyd and wondered where he had gotten the costume. One thing led to another and he ended up doing promotional work for “Ghostbusters” for about nine years for Columbia Pictures, making appearances for licensees and children’s hospitals.\n\nMosen has a vast collection of “Ghostbuster” and other theatrical memorabilia. He has even built a few replicas of the “Ghostbuster” ambulance, the Ectomobile. Having an automotive background and experience in making theatrical and special-event props, Mosen was able to re-create an Ectomobile that looked better than the original movie vehicle. He has won awards in several costume competitions, including Best Villain in the Re-Creation Class for his Klingon Warrior at the 1984 World Sci-Fi Con. Others include C3PO & R2D2, Cylon and Daggit, Darth Vader and Alien.\n\nHis first was a 1966 Cadillac Ambulance with the Ecto-1 New York license plates. Mosen applied for the plates as soon as he saw the movie. He acquired the car from Tom Martin of the Hollywood Dream Factory in Ohio for 500 \"Vampirella\" movie posters. Martin had found the car at a swap meet and planned on doing it up as a Ghostbuster vehicle for his store. Peter called him and told him he had the Ecto 1 plates and Martin felt that the two just had to get together. So Mosen finally got the car and using a bed frame for the roof rack, pool hoses and other assorted items, he created the perfect replica. This car was bought by someone in Argentina.\n\nHis second was a 1959 Cadillac Hearst/Ambulance combo, an exact replica from the movie, that was later bought by none other than George Barris. “I kick myself every day for selling that car,” Mosen said. “I put my heart and soul into it. Maybe he will leave it to me in his will.” The car now sits at the Stars Cars Museum in Tennessee.\n\nToday Mosen drives a 2000 Impala, Ecto-1A, with the “Ghostbusters III” logo on the side, and is already planning for the next movie. He plans to update the graphics.\n\nIt’s been over 30 years, but Mosen still is a “Ghosthead.” He has a company called “Rent An Alien” and makes appearances at parades, car shows and other functions. He has also written a book, The Original Ghosthead: 30-Year Journey of a Lifetime,” recounting his days doing PR for the Columbia pictures. He’s looking for a publisher.\n\nMosen is one of many “Ghostbuster” fans worldwide, but there can only be one Original Ghosthead, and he wears the crown.\n\nTo find out more about Peter Mosen go to imdb.me/petermosen.\n\nGo to recordonline.com/myride for the latest episode of “My Ride Garage” that features Peter Mosen.\n\ndkessler@th-record.com"
