There are some funny girls out there.”\n\nFor McCarthy’s part, she remains noncommittal, though open to the idea. “Oh, my God, that’s daunting,” she answered the Star when prompted about starring in the potential film with the aforementioned ladies. “That’s taking on a legend, a legendary movie. But I would do anything with those ladies, anything at all.”\n\nFor fans of the original “Ghostbusters,” it’s currently back on the big screen in celebration of its 30th anniversary.\n\nImage credits: PA/AP\n\nRead more on Yahoo Movies:\n\nJennifer Lawrence Breaks Guinness World Record\n\nThe Rock Confirms DC Movies Role"
