        "text": "This is a personal post. I love great action movies, I can't help it. You'll see through my other posts my hope that we're about to have a renaissance in the action movie genre. With Jason Statham's Beekeeper getting a high profile cinema release, with word of mouth propelling it forwards to achieve a very important audience score on RottenTomatoes.com https://lnkd.in/eqqYfDvY My hope was for that to continue with a reimagining of an 80's favourite \"Roadhouse\". The trailer came out today, 25th Jan, showcasing a leading A List movie star kicking ass and Conor McGregor turning it up to 11 as the bad guy, essentially, what more do you need? With multiple reports of the film performing highly in test screenings, the film is not getting a theatrical release. With the renowned action producer, Joel Silver's alleged own frustrations regarding this situation having been echoed by the films director today. https://lnkd.in/ebEyGysf Therefore, I thought I'd start a petition (and why not), to see if there is truly a market to see this movie theatrically. I personally would love to see it on the big screen. With Beekeeper recently performing very well, there is a definite market for an action movie, presented the right way. Therefore, if you can spend 30 seconds, and you love action films, please sign my petition. Once I've got 5 votes, it'll be more visible, and then let's grow it from there. Let's get Amazon to release Roadhouse in the theatre, even if for a limited run. #roadhouse #amazon #actionmovies HERE IS THE LINK - https://lnkd.in/ei3qBh7t\n\nThis is a personal post. After a fantastic storyline was delivered with MJF during 2022 in AEW, CM Punk had his challenges with a few people in that company, who thought they knew better than someone with decades of experience. Resulting in issues in Summer of 2022 and again in 2023. (I'm on Punk's side throughout). Thankfully, those people really didn't know what they were doing and the result is that CM Punk returned to WWE on Saturday night. He is one of the best in the business at promo's, putting a coherent storyline together and his matches always deliver. The result will be must see TV and WrestleMania 40 is going to be superb. WWE showed their Trademark logo, making you think Survivor Series had ended, and then, this..... Perfection #wwe #cmpunk\n\nThis is a personal post. Following on from my post regarding Silent Night last month, in that I hope it re-starts the low to medium budget, high quality action genre. As mentioned in that post, Accident Man is one of the best Martial Arts movies in a long time. Here is a very interesting article about Scott Adkins, who I agree, is one of the last great action hero's we have. Where, hopefully, the quality of his work, will inspire a few of the next generation, as Jean Claude Van Damme did for him, to take up the mantle and to keep CGI free, real action cinema alive. #scottadkins #actionmovie #martialarts https://lnkd.in/esjKHKZc\n\nThis is a personal post... As a fan of movies, especially action movies, in recent years, it's been tough. Could Silent Night be the movie that brings back the smaller budgeted action movie to the mainstream? I hope so... Could Silent Night create a new action movie star for years to come? I hope so... As there has been a dearth of quality action movies' except for John Wick 1, Accident Man, Violent Night & Nobody, when compared to the late 80's and early 90's heyday (in terms of the amount of movies made and the number of legit action stars with screen presence). With John Woo returning as director and the trailer sneakily pulling on your heart strings by using Beethoven's Ode to Joy from Die Hard (and why not). I cannot wait to see this. #actionmovies #cinema\n\nHello all, this is a personal post. As does anyone who has a great interest regarding a particular subject, they go to those with experience and success, to learn everything they can. I'm a big fan of wrestling, and therefore, I've listened to Jim Cornette's Podcast for the past 4 years. Learning about wrestling history, how he'd improve today's product (WWE and AEW) and he provides an important insightful viewpoint based on an incredible amount of knowledge and experience. On occasion, he'll take a slight detour, discussing a particular subject of the moment. Over the past few months, one subject he's been discussing is next level fascinating, involving Colin Thomson and everything to do with Kast Media / Live One and how it has impacted his own podcast, their advertisers and many others. This discussion that he started with Brian Last (his co-host), has now got its own play list on his YouTube channel. Theo Von, an American comedian has now raised the same concerns, as well as many other podcasters, and this story is now gaining traction. I think this story is going to become mainstream in the months to come, and I hope everyone who has been affected by this gets their money back. Below is the link to the podcast about the whole ordeal to date and be warned, there is interesting language included üòÄ .\n\nIt's WrestleMania week üòÅ üéÜ üôå and this year it is No.39 - live on the WWE Network. #wwe #wrestlemania I've been watching WrestleMania since No.5 and each year, the Show of Shows hinges essentially on its Main Event. Over the last decade, the WWE product has not been the best. The lack of new larger than life characters, to replace the greats that have now retired is more evident than ever. In addition, poor storyline after poor storyline with no pay offs (which is key). This past year, things are very different, Paul Levesque (HHH), who is one of the greats, is now head of creative. The result has been some of the best long term story telling in years and the development of future main event stars has began (i.e. Cody Rhodes, Austin Theory, LA Knight, Rhea Ripley). The Roman Reigns, Cody Rhodes, Bloodline, Sami Zayn, Kevin Owens storyline is superb and as a main event should do, has sold the PPV on its own. The fact that there are then many more must see matches taking place over the two night event (i.e. Rhea Ripley vs Charlotte Flair), means this could really be the greatest PPV in years. With WWE currently up for sale, its guaranteed that all the money is going to be spent making this event a success. If you used to watch wrestling when you were younger and gave up on it, maybe watch these videos below, it might just get you back into it. This year, I'll be watching it with my children and I can't wait, as watching wrestling with them and seeing their reactions to the heels and faces, is terrific. Uso's & Sami Zayn storyline https://lnkd.in/gMpNFkHX Full Bloodline Story https://lnkd.in/gJtUqeFm #creative #storytelling #wwe\n\nJust a short post to say Thank You to everyone at Barking, Havering and Redbridge University Hospitals NHS Trust, specifically Queens Hospital, the Ocean B Ward and the Thurrock Ambulance service. Five weeks ago, after experiencing severe stomach pains overnight, I was assessed and taken to hospital by ambulance and within 12 hours, was having emergency surgery. Post surgery, it was confirmed I had Peritonitis, (following a burst appendix). After 10 Days in hospital and having received great care throughout, I was discharged from hospital and now I'm on the road to fully recovering (and I'm counting down the days to being able to lift weights again). :-) Having seen first hand what the NHS have to deal with on a daily basis, the many hours they're working to help all patients, in addition, the professionalism and politeness that they maintained at all times. Everyone at Queens Hospital went above and beyond to look after me and it is greatly appreciated. #thankyou #thatwasclose Barking, Havering and Redbridge University Hospitals NHS Trust\n\nA personal thought.. No.1 From the start of my career and still to this day, I personally find one of the best ways to learn is to work with those with experience of \"X\", where \"X\" is something specific you may be new to, unfamiliar with, or where you may not have the amount of knowledge needed to excel at \"X\". You can read specific books, learn the theory behind \"X\", maybe bring with you similar experiences from your own past (although they're not specifically the same and consequently irrelevant). Therefore, I suggest, your only option is spending time with those that have had relevant specific experience in \"X\" during their own professional career. In addition, whether that previous experience of \"X\" is positive or negative, it is all very valid. Therefore, I suggest, if you're unfamiliar regarding whatever your \"X\" is and someone has specific experience in it, go and seek that advice and additionally, be prepared to receive it. As it may be the difference between professionally winning or losing. #thoughtleadership #knowledgesharing #advicematters"
