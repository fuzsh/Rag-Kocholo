        "text": "Ever in search of a way to part players with their money, Bungie is using its dark talents to manifest a Ghostbusters: Frozen Empire crossover with Destiny 2. Is this hybrid hype machine/preying on nostalgia the wisest move with player sentiment being so low, or are there other unseen forces at play?\n\nSony seeks a return on investment from Bungie\n\nIn a Twitter post by the official Destiny 2 account, the sci-fi looter shooter is getting a crossover with the upcoming Ghostbusters: Frozen Empire film on March 19, 2024. The crossover bundle consists of three items, a Slimer Ghost Shell, an Ecto-1 ship, and what I believe is the movie’s big bad in Sparrow form.\n\nAside from the Ecto-1, the bundle doesn’t look great. The Slimer Ghost Shell has the same homemade quality as other Ghost Shells and Guardian masks during the in-game Festival of the Lost. Seeing it outside of the event and the general season is jarring. It’s like releasing a Ghostbusters film in March.\n\nAs for why the crossover is even happening, it’s likely due to Sony acquiring the Ghostbusters IP through its ownership of Columbia Pictures which, in turn, owns Ghost Corps, a division focused on expanding the Ghostbusters brand. Sony also acquired Bungie as part of a $3.6B buyout in 2022.\n\nDuring the FY2023 Q3 Earnings Announcement, Sony Interactive Entertainment’s Chairman, Hiroki Totoki, expressed displeasure with Bungie’s leadership following the delay of The Final Shape by four months.\n\n“I visited the Bungie studios and had meetings with [the] management, and I saw that employees working at the studios were highly motivated, showing great creativity as well as an impressive knowledge of live services. However, I also felt that there was room for improvement from a business perspective with regard to areas such as the use of business expenses and assuming accountability for development timelines. I hope to continue the dialogue and come up with some good solutions.”\n\nAs such, it’s not entirely shocking that the corporation would prod its new Bellevue studio to crank out some promotional items for its new film. The 2016 Ghostbusters film grossed $229.1M worldwide with a production budget of $144M and the 2021 Ghostbusters: Afterlife film grossed $204M worldwide with a production budget of $75M. With conflicting critic and audience scores for each film on Rotten Tomatoes, it’s hard to predict how Ghostbusters: Frozen Empire will pan out, so every little bit of extra cash will help.\n\nSentiment amongst the Destiny 2 community is mixed with players like myself seeing it as yet another cash grab in Bungie’s long history of the practice. Others are embracing it simply out of the joy of two beloved franchises coming together.\n\nI’ll admit that I am biased as the layoffs and subsequent information that came out of the October 2023 layoffs at Bungie tainted my feelings for the franchise. What had been months of anger over the winter has turned into apathy and continued disappointment. I’m trying to remain fair and impartial, but it’s difficult.\n\nThere was a time when I might have been all in on this collaboration as I the right age during peak Ghostbusters, greedily gulping up my Ecto Cooler Hi-C while fighting imaginary ghosts with my Proton Pack and Ghost Trap. The world that Dan Aykroyd and Harold Rami crafted hits that sweet spot of late 80s NYC nostalgia and the supernatural in a unique way.\n\nPerhaps I’m simply getting too worked up about a marketing ploy that ultimately won’t matter in the grand scheme of things and I’m letting my cynicism of corporations destroying art in the name of profit get in the way. Either way, this is a collaboration that doesn't fit, even if Ghosts are an integral part of both franchises."
