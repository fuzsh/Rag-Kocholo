        "text": "Even at its worst, the four-decade Ghostbusters franchise of films, animated series and games is still a genial time-passer. That low point is not 2016’s now-orphaned Ghostbusters: Answer the Call; frankly, it’s better than everything but the 1984 original. It’s Ghostbusters II, where excellent visual effects are helpless against Bill Murray’s epidemic-level disdain for the material.\n\nTo wit, Ghostbusters: Frozen Empire — the fifth overall film and second in a newly requelized universe — refers to that sequel’s events as “the Statue of Liberty debacle of 1989.” Of course, Frozen Empire’s own challenge is building on 2021’s Ghostbusters: Afterlife. That installment started off fun and fresh before simply restaging the original film’s finale in middle-of-nowhere Oklahoma. And while Afterlife was the first sequel Murray looked happy to appear in, it also attempted what no Ghostbusters film needs: grandiose emotional response.\n\nIts treacly resolution played like an eight-figure, CGI-assisted wake for the late Harold Ramis, whose original Ghostbuster character Egon Spengler spawned most of the new Ghostbusters featured here — daughter Callie (Carrie Coon) and grandchildren Phoebe (McKenna Grace) and Trevor (Finn Wolfhard). Paul Rudd brings up the rear as Gary Grooberson, an affable seismologist / science teacher / love interest for Callie / stepfather figure for Phoebe and Trevor.\n\nIn taking the torch from father Ivan (who directed the first two films and passed away in 2022), director / co-writer Jason Reitman grabbed it by the flaming end. Per its subtitle, Frozen Empire is a song of ice (and fire) for which Jason Reitman is back as a co-writer while yielding directorial duties to co-writer Gil Kenan.\n\n“Better than it has any right to be” has been Kenan’s calling card from the high-point of Robert Zemeckis-adjacent motion-capture animation in 2006’s Monster House to the modest pleasures of his 2015 Poltergeist remake. Frozen Empire falls into that wheelhouse. Kenan keeps things light, commendably directs a lot of character traffic and concocts enough charming comedy, surprising subtext and evocative throwback cinematography to offset an ultimate hedge on the bet of big spectacle that he and Jason Reitman perhaps preferred to make. No film that kicks off with a lyrically apocalyptic Robert Frost poem should have an ending this small.\n\nGary and the Spenglers have relocated to New York, where original Ghostbuster Winston Zeddemore (Ernie Hudson) is now their bustin’ benefactor. To this foursome, Winston has bequeathed the legendary firehouse, from which they spar with specters to the disdain of Mayor Walter Peck (William Atherton, returning as the civil-servant curmudgeon from the original film).\n\nThe sticking point? Phoebe is only 15. As she points out: Just more than a century earlier, she’d have been laboring for several years already and in labor with several kids. Although Phoebe possesses the most passionate parascientific inclinations of the group, she is sidelined.\n\nMeanwhile, Winston and fellow OG Ghostbuster Ray Stantz (Dan Aykroyd) collaborate on a paranormal research center — a Q Branch for Ghostbusters tasked to create an ecto-containment unit of unlimited space. What about the one at the firehouse? Imagine a giant garbage disposal glopped with 40 years of ghoulies. Talk about the verge of a four-fold cross rip.\n\nReturning from Afterlife as respective interns of Winston and Ray are Lucky (Celeste O’Connor) and the unfortunately named Podcast (Logan Kim). There’s a new British upstart at the research center named Lars (James Acaster). And after an ancient orb with destructive telekinetic tendencies makes its way to the counter of Ray’s curiosity shop, even puerile Peter Venkman (Murray) and acidic administrative assistant Janine Melnitz (Annie Potts) suit up.\n\nThrow in a new character’s unexpected supernatural powers, and that’s TWELVE GHOSTBUSTERS teaming up to take on Garraka. Introduced in a sufficiently spooky prologue, Garraka is an ancient demon able to summon the Death Chill — which can literally freeze the world in fear — and eager to bust open that straining containment unit for an army of angry ghosts. Garraka is a digital, horned Slenderman, but at least it’s not another Gozer go-round.\n\nFrozen Empire also finds Gary struggling to solidify a stepfather-ly relationship with Phoebe. Trevor chases that old slob Slimer in the firehouse attic. The miniature Stay Puft Marshmallow Men return for more Minion-ish mayhem. A ghost named Possessor can control any inanimate object it touches. Kumail Nanjiani and Patton Oswalt turn up for key roles of comic relief and spirited exposition in beautifully rendered basement-bowel libraries and hidden chambers. Plus, Phoebe strikes a surprisingly, unsubtly and refreshingly queer-coded spark with a ghost named Melody (Emily Alyn Lind). If you must spend eternity as a 16-year-old who died in a tenement fire, it’s good to at least expire before your face burns off. Jokes aside, Phoebe and Melody’s moments together lend a lovely, melancholy context to the ghostly trope of unfinished business.\n\nAn incompetent hand would tip this genuinely insane amount of narrative incident toward incoherence. Kenan has certainly never spun so many plates in one picture before, but he somehow pulls it off and finds time to flick one finger with an unexpectedly tipped cap to Ivan Reitman’s days of early exploitation filmmaking.\n\nEven so, Rudd, Coon, Wolfhard, O’Connor, Kim and Acaster disappear for large swaths of time (and with at least one of their seemingly icy fates reversed sans explanation). Fantastical events, like iconic fountains freezing or a New York Public Library Lion jumping to life, transpire with nary a New Yorker remarking on something strange in their neighborhood. There are also third-act inconsistencies regarding Ray and his knowledge of effective strategy to fight Garraka."
