        "text": "Unlike the 2016 reboot movie, Ghostbusters: Afterlife will include all of the surviving Ghostbusters, including Peter Venkman. Via Heroic Hollywood, Bill Murray told Vanity Fair that he will reprise his role as Venkman in the new film. Murray didn’t provide details as to what happened to Venkman since Ghostbusters 2. However, he did allude to Venkman’s friend, Egon Spengler, who was played by the late Harold Ramis in the original Ghostbusters films.\n\n“Well, we are a man down,” said Murray. “That’s the deal. And that’s the story that we’re telling, that’s the story they’ve written.”\n\nThe first Ghostbusters: Afterlife trailer debuted last month, and it hinted that Mckenna Grace’s Phoebe and Finn Wolfhard’s Trevor are Egon’s grandkids. It also had the classic Ghostbusters suit, as well as ECTO-1 vehicle and the Proton Packs.\n\nRELATED: Paul Feig Wants To Crossover His Ghostbusters Movie With Afterlife\n\nMurray also expressed confidence in Jason Reitman’s sequel.\n\n”The script is good. It’s got lots of emotion in it,” noted Murray. “[It has] lots of family in it, with through lines that are really interesting. It’s gonna work.”\n\nDay Aykroyd, Ernie Hudson, Sigourney Weaver, and Annie Potts are already confirmed to appear as well. Vanity Fair’s story noted that Murray and the other Ghostbusters veterans were only on set “over the span of a week and will have meaningful, but not central roles in the film.”\n\nGhostbusters: Afterlife, which also stars Paul Rudd, McKenna Grace and Finn Wolfhard, opens in theaters on July 10. Are you happy to see Murray come back to the franchise? Let us know in the comments below!\n\nRecommended Reading: Ghostbusters: The Ultimate Visual History"
