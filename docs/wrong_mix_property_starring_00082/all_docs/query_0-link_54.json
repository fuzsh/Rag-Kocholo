        "text": "Reviewed by Joy Parris: The Ghostbusters franchise, mixing up comedy, action, and spooky things, has been a hit with fans since the ’80s. Sure, not every movie was a critic’s darling, and a couple might’ve missed the mark, but there’s no denying it still holds a special spot for loads of us.\n\nTomorrow March 22nd, “Ghostbusters: Frozen Empire” hits the screen with an icy blast that sends shivers down your spine, but not without a good dose of the iconic Ghostbusters humor we’ve all come to love. This latest installment takes our beloved team of ghost-catchers to the snow-clad peaks of the Arctic, where ancient spirits are waking up, and not in a good mood.\n\nFrom the get-go, the film feels like a love letter to fans and newcomers alike. It’s packed with action, laughs, and just the right amount of nostalgia. The visuals? Stunning. The Arctic landscape provides a breathtaking backdrop to the spectral shenanigans, making every scene a feast for the eyes. And let’s not even get started on the special effects—the ghosts have never looked more eerily beautiful, or more terrifying.\n\nThe cast, both old and new, brings their A-game. The original team slips back into their roles like they never left, bringing depth and warmth to the story. The new faces are just as delightful, adding fresh energy and humor that meshes well with the seasoned Ghostbusters. There’s a real sense of camaraderie among the cast that translates into dynamic on-screen chemistry.\n\n“Frozen Empire” manages to be fresh while staying true to the franchise’s roots. The script cleverly balances the spooky and the silly, ensuring that the laughs never undermine the thrills. There’s a new depth to the lore, exploring themes of legacy, friendship, and facing the unknown with a proton pack in hand and a quip ready to fire.\n\nBut what truly sets “Frozen Empire” apart is its heart. Amidst the chaos of ghostly battles and Arctic expeditions, weaves messages about teamwork, bravery, and believing in the impossible. This heartwarming undercurrent leaves a lasting impression, making the film more than just a ghost-catching adventure—a reminder of why we fell in love with the Ghostbusters in the first place.\n\n“Ghostbusters: Frozen Empire” is a laugh-out-loud adventure that pays homage to its predecessors while carving out its unique place in the franchise. Whether you’re a die-hard fan or a curious newcomer, this film is a must-watch. It proves that some things, like the Ghostbusters’ charm (and their ghosts), don’t freeze over.\n\n“Ghostbusters: Frozen Empire,” directed by co-writer Gil Kenan, shows the Spengler family embracing their legacy in New York, to reside in the iconic firehouse and keeping the ghostbusting flame alive. The gang’s all here: Callie (Carrie Coon), Trevor (Finn Wolfhard), and Phoebe (Mckenna Grace) return, alongside Gary Grooberson (Paul Rudd), their one-time teacher figuring out how to be a stepdad. Lucky (Celeste O’Connor) and Podcast (Logan Kim) have also leaped the city, joining their old friends. And, of course, the original Ghostbusters—Ray Stantz (Dan Aykroyd), Winston Zeddemore (Ernie Hudson), and Peter Venkman (Bill Murray)—are back in action, with their trusty receptionist, Janine (Annie Potts), in tow. Not to forget, Walter Peck (William Atherton) is back at it, causing trouble like old times.\n\nIn addition, the movie introduces a scientist (played by James Acaster) at a paranormal research facility and a librarian (Patton Oswalt) who’s an expert in folklore and serves up essential background information for a scene set in 1904. We also meet Nadeem (Kumail Nanjiani), a slick operator who deals Ray — now the proprietor of a downtown oddities shop — an ancient orb inscribed with glyphs. This orb houses a demon centuries old and the ticket to thwarting the demon’s release (which, definitely happens). And let’s not forget Melody, a spectral entity who engages Phoebe in one of my favorite scenes: a ghostly chess game, and shares a unique bond with her. Their growing closeness, teetering on the edge of romance, is skillfully portrayed, careful not to stir controversy among the more conservative audiences or jeopardize the film’s international screening prospects."
