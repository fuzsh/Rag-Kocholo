Ghostbusters\". The Ghostbuster squad made up of Peter Venkman (Bill Murray), Ray Stantz (Dan Aykroyd), and Egon Spengler (Harold Ramis) hit the silver screen for the first time 40 years ago today.\n\nAlso a hit was their theme song, Ghostbusters by Ray Parker Jr. Let's take a look at what the stars of the film have been up to for the past 40 years.\n\nClick here to follow the Mirror US on Google News to stay up to date with all the latest news, sport and entertainment stories.\n\nREAD MORE: Three women changed Mattel for the better in new 'Black Barbie' Trailer\n\nREAD MORE: Zac Efron and Nicole Kidman star in A Family Affair trailer as fans accuse Netflix of copying film\n\nBill Murray\n\nBill was already an established funnyman when Ghostbusters premiered, but his stardom only climbed higher afterward. He went on to star in films like What About Bob (1991), Groundhog Day (1993), and Lost in Translation (2003).\n\nFor his role in Lost In Translation, Bill was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Actor. He's also performed in various Wes Anderson films like Rushmore (1998), The Royal Tenenbaums (2001), and The Grand Budapest.

He was also known for playing more serious roles in films like Driving Miss Daisy (1989), My Girl (1991), and Chaplin (1992).\n\nHe had a cameo in the 2016 film Ghostbusters, and reprised his role as Raymond Stantz in Ghostbusters: Afterlife in 2021 and Ghostbusters: Frozen Empire in 2024. Outside of acting, he co-founded the House of Blues music venues and Crystal Head Vodka.\n\nSigourney Weaver\n\nAfter her role in Ghostbusters, she reprised her other iconic role as Ellen Ripley in Alien 3 (1992) and Alien Resurrection (1997). In 1989 she received two Academy Award nominations - one for Best Actress in Gorillas in the Mist and the other for Best Supporting Actress for Working Girl.\n\nShe's also starred in James Cameron's Avatar (2009) and Avatar: The Way of Water (2022).
