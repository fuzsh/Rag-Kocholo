I spent my early career running (or biking) around NYC responding to workplace soft tissue injuries. Now I’m not sure Bill Murray would agree…but MSK injury sure does feel like Viggo’s pink slime from Ghostbusters 2…flowing underneath the streets of most industrial companies. stick with me on this metaphor :) So if injuries are the ‘ghost’ of sorts…what do you do when one pops up? One of the biggest predictors of success after a work injury is who you speak to first & how soon. The challenge is most ‘urgent’ response care centers are better equipped for answering the ‘are you dealing with a medical emergency’…and misses opportunity to provide valuable orthopedic evaluation & early guidance. While workplace ‘first aid’ programs typically sit on the other end & rely some standard 'ice/rest/anti-inflammatory' that misses the importance of skilled evaluation. Although it’s one piece of the puzzle…having a team who both understands the work & understands the injury recovery path is a crucial step. A ton to unpack here...but in the messy pink slime covered work of MSK injury, rapid response is a big lever to pull!
