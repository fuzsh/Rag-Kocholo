        "text": "LOS ANGELES — You could argue that Hollywood’s\n\nsequel mania really began in earnest in 1989, when the box-office\n\ngrosses started piling up for both “Ghostbusters 2” and “Lethal Weapon\n\n2,” proving that there was no good reason — from the business end of\n\nthe equation — why you had to come up with an original idea for a\n\nblockbuster movie when you could just milk something that had already\n\nworked. “Lethal Weapon” went on to a long and happy sequel life.\n\nBut Sony\n\nhas never been able to mount another installment in the “Ghostbusters”\n\nfranchise — though you can’t say it hasn’t been for lack of trying. It\n\nfeels as if every time I turn around, I read a story about how sequel\n\nefforts are moving ahead with another round of screenwriters at work,\n\ntrying to figure out how to spin something off from the landmark 1984\n\ncomedy that ushered in an entire era of “Men in Black”-style comic\n\nspecial-effects films.\n\nIf there’s always one fly in the ointment, it’s Bill Murray.\n\nEven though pretty much everyone else involved with the project seems\n\nto have a vested interest in making a “Ghostbusters 3,” Murray, who is\n\nnothing if not an iconoclastic free spirit, keeps saying “no way, Jose.”\n\nThat doesn’t mean that Sony\n\ncouldn’t just write him out of the movie, although some recent stories\n\nhave argued that Murray, along with his fellow original stars, Dan Aykroyd and Harold Ramis, have veto power over any new project moving ahead.\n\nBut everyone seems to want his blessing. Bless his\n\nheart, Murray seems to feel the same way about sequels that I do: that\n\nwith rare exception (and yes, I’m willing to admit that “The Dark\n\nKnight” is a worthy exception), studio sequels are almost always more\n\ndutiful than inspired. In New York, promoting his new film, “Get Low,” Murray laid it on the line. Asked if “Ghostbusters 3” was ever going to happen, he replied:\n\n“No, it’s ridiculous. That’s an absolutely — that’s just a horrible rumor. It’s like illegitimate children in Antarctica,\n\nit’s ridiculous …. Mind you, we only made two, and the first one was\n\nstill the better one, so another one wouldn’t seem to be any better.\n\nThe studio wants to make it because they can re-create the franchise\n\nand put new Ghostbusters in it. That’s what it’s about.”\n\nIf you’re laying odds, I’d say the odds of Murray\n\ngiving his blessing to a new “Ghostbusters” sequel are about as good as\n\nthe odds of Sandra Bullock getting back together with Jesse James.\n\n———\n\n(c) 2010, Los Angeles Times.\n\nVisit the Los Angeles Times on the Internet at http://www.latimes.com/\n\nDistributed by McClatchy-Tribune Information Services."
