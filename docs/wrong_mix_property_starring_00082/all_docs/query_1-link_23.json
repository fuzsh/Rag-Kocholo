        "text": "Last Updated on July 30, 2021\n\nWe've known for a while that original GHOSTBUSTERS stars Dan Aykroyd, Ernie Hudson, Sigourney Weaver, and Annie Potts are all in director Jason Reitman's upcoming sequel GHOSTBUSTERS 2020, reprising the roles they played in the first two GHOSTBUSTERS movies. But there has been some lingering uncertainty over whether or not Bill Murray is involved with the movie.\n\nAs recently as mid-September, Aykroyd could only say they were \"hoping\" Murray would appear in the film. Spy pics did catch Murray having dinner with the returning cast in the area GHOSTBUSTERS 2020 was being filmed in, so there seemed to be a good chance he would show up on set around that time. Still, nobody confirmed Murray's involvement before production wrapped at the end of October.\n\nNow Aykroyd has gone ahead and confirmed that Murray will be in the movie. While being interviewed on the Greg Hill radio show, Aykroyd had the following to say about GHOSTBUSTERS 2020:\n\nJason Reitman wrote a beautiful, heartfelt script that takes the real DNA from the first two movies and transfers that directly to the third. The next generation, hands the legacy off to a new generation of stars and players and actors and characters. We've shot our part, myself, Murray, Sigourney, and Annie Potts, and it was really exciting working on this new idea. A new take on the story, which Jason, who's a really incredible and fine filmmaker, came up with. So I'm pretty excited. … You don't know what's gonna be a hit or not, but I have really good feelings for this, just because of the quality of the stars we've got there. We've got some really terrific young actors, and a great story, a great setting. It's gonna be scary, it's gonna be thought provoking, it's gonna be very heartfelt. You'll feel it, if you have loved ones that you miss and you've lost and you want to get back with, it's gonna be evocative in that way.\"\n\nI've lost a lot of loved ones, so he really got to me with that last bit of information.\n\nWritten by Reitman and Gil Kenan, the new film centers on\n\na family who moves back home to a small town. While there, they begin to learn more about who they are and the secrets of the town itself.\n\nThe family is being played by Carrie Coon, Mckenna Grace, and Finn Wolfhard. Oliver Cooper, Celeste O’Connor, and Logan Kim are also in the cast, with Paul Rudd on board to play a seismologist who's teaching summer school while investigating some mysterious earthquakes."
