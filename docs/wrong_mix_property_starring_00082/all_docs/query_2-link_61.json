Now whether the studio will do it, I’m the guy who sits by the phone and waits for the call. So if they call, I’ll answer. If not, I’ve got other stuff that I’m doing.”\n\nHis co-star Harold Ramis, who played Egon Spengler, died in 2014.\n\nThe new film, which Reitman teased in a brief clip, will be set in the present day and will reportedly focus on four teenagers.\n\nThe most shocking film twists of all time\n\nShow all 37\n\n“I’ve always thought of myself as the first Ghostbusters fan, when I was a 6-year-old visiting the set [of the 1984 film],“ Reitman said. ”I wanted to make a movie for all the other fans.“\n\nReitman called it “the next chapter in the original franchise”, and assured fans it would not be a reboot or related to Paul Feig’s all-female version that was released in 2016.\n\nSubscribe to Independent Premium to bookmark this article\n\nWant to bookmark your favourite articles and stories to read or reference later?
