Just hearing the original actors voice and the fact that it seems to keep the same type of humor (thanks to Ramis and Akroyd's writing) is just stupendous. How can Atari really screw it up, aren't they just publishing it?[/quote]\n\nThey could pull a Far Cry 2 and release it at a god-awful time.\n\n[quote name='D4rkewolfe']Well, I suppose that'll hurt the game, but not the content itself. Then again I think I read the date now is sometimes in June of 09? Summer time, lack of games normally, so I think it'll be ok...hopefully[/quote]\n\nI do want this game to be good. Like most things, I have my doubts. And Bill Murray does sound like he phoned in his voice work. He had more enthusiasm in the live-action Garfield movie. (\n\nWell it varies in the situation as well. Most of the scenes where he talked seemed to be one of those parts where he is supposed to be cool and collected. Reminded a bit of the Peter Venkman from the animated series.\n\nI'm sure there will be scenes where he will have a chance to just be loud. I know a few are saying it sounds like he phoned it in...but it sounded fine to me. I mean he wasn't loud through the whole movie(s). The tone seemed ok for what it was, a nonchalant individual\n\n[quote name='JolietJake']I don't think the actors really had their hearts in the voice acting, Bill Murray sounded like he phoned it in.[/quote]\n\nWell I know that Aykroyd definitely has his heart in it as he wrote the script (along with Ramis) for the game and has been pretty much the driving force to get this thing going.\n\nSo far it is looking great.\n\n[quote name='JolietJake']I don't think the actors really had their hearts in the voice acting, Bill Murray sounded like he phoned it in.[/quote]\n\nI get we're dissecting this thing to amazingly tiny pieces, but really, it's a 1:30 trailer with maybe 3 lines spoken by Murray in it.\n\nI don't think it's a fair assumption to make that they were phoning it in or didn't have their hearts in it.\n\nNo. They made it that way to keep the original humor intact. That way the interaction between the original Ghostbusters will be just as it would in a new movie.\n\nThe story is that they are doing very well that they are hiring a new member to help with all the jobs they've been getting. This is where you come in. You will be the one they will send to do the dirty work and I think also test out Egon's new inventions. You're the guinea pig.\n\n[quote name='Psykoboy2']I get we're dissecting this thing to amazingly tiny pieces, but really, it's a 1:30 trailer with maybe 3 lines spoken by Murray in it.\n\nI don't think it's a fair assumption to make that they were phoning it in or didn't have their hearts in it.[/quote]\n\nexactly... we can't tell how good the voice acting is from a trailer.\n\n[quote name='D4rkewolfe']No. They made it that way to keep the original humor intact.

I remember reading an interview with Bill Murray somewhere where he said he enjoyed doing the voice work for this game, and that it got him excited for a third movie.\n\nhttp://www.aintitcool.com/node/38496\n\nOh yeah -- I can't wait for this game\n\n[quote name='doctorfaustus']Looks good.\n\nWTF is up with Ernie Hudson? He's built like Urkel. They need to show Zeddemore some love.[/quote]\n\nThe animation seemed odd in that trailer. In some shots, the models were really well crafted, and in others they seemed to be awkward refugees from the uncanny valley.\n\nI suspect some of the shots are from earlier builds with less polish on them.\n\n[quote name='Chizzer']The animation seemed odd in that trailer. In some shots, the models were really well crafted, and in others they seemed to be awkward refugees from the uncanny valley.\n\nI suspect some of the shots are from earlier builds with less polish on them.[/quote]\n\nVery, very true. The uncanny valley popped into my head, as well.\n\n[quote name='doctorfaustus']Blasphemy. Louis Tully, the Super Mario Bros lovin', Janine Meltnitz romancin', unofficial fifth Ghostbuster can not be forgotten.[/quote]\n\nUgh...though I will still watch and enjoy GBII to this day, that whole sequence was douche-chill inducing, as is a great deal of the rest of the film. The Tully character was much better in the first film. He has a smaller part, but so many classic lines.\n\nI most definitely am. Then again, I won't be looking at it with the critical eye that most will - I just want it to be a fun experience that is true to the franchise. Doesn't need to be game of the year material (like MW2). Should be nice...and I can't wait to see the Blu release of the film!\n\nLooks like its canned guys...PS3/PSP exclusive (\n\nA brief search on Xboxic will show you that we have made over 6 reports on the upcoming game ‘Ghostbusters’ since January 2007. In short, the title was dropped by Activision, picked up by Atari and now in an unexpected move - sold to Sony Computer Entertainment. The game was due to be released on the Xbox360 19th June to tie in with the new movie release, but in this new move to Sony it will now remain a PS3 exclusive for the time being!\n\nSo it seems that in a move to please Atari’s investors whilst the company is struggling in todays current economic crisis; they decided to sell their distribution business earlier this year and now the Ghostbusters deal to Sony. Atari have stated however that with Sony publishing the title, the game will reach a wider audience on release.\n\nWith Sony Computer Entertainment, the proud new owners of ‘Ghostbusters’ the game will remain PS3 exclusive for time being with a PSP release to follow. It is currently unknown what will happen to the Xbox360, Wii & DS versions, but Atari may publish them some time in the near future.\n\nWhilst the scheduled release for the Xbox360 version was only next month! Did you have this on pre-order, are you disappointed or maybe you just couldn’t care? Share your thoughts below.\n\nhttp://www.xboxic.com/news/5269\n\ning Sony!"
