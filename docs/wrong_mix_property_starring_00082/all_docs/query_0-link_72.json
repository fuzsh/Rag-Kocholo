        "text": "A Quarter Century After The Hit Movie, The Ghostbusters Are Still Going Strong\n\nEctozone Press International June 8, 2009 On June 8, 1984, Columbia Pictures (now a subsidiary of Sony) released Ghostbusters, a big budget movie comedy starring Bill Murray, Dan Aykroyd, and Harold Ramis (along with Sigourney Weaver, Rick Moranis, Ernie Hudson, Annie Potts, and William Atherton). Today, of course, not only marks the twenty fifth anniversary of the movie release, but we see a resurgence of the media presence of the famous spook smashers. Sony is releasing the two movies (the original and its less successful 1989 sequel) on Blu-Ray, and a big budget video game (reuniting the original cast minus Weaver and Moranis) is soon to be on the shelves, courtesy of Atari. And the talk of a third movie has been the strongest it's been in a decade, with Gene Stupnitsky and Lee Eisenberg (the writing team from the American version of The Office) working on a script.\n\nBut what about the real Ghostbusters? Behind the media blitz and the famous films and successful 80's animated series hide the genuine personalities from whom Aykroyd and Ramis drew their inspiration.\n\nWhen I interviewed the Ghostbusters recently, the first thing that came up was the fact that \"You know 2009 isn't really the twenty-fifth anniversary...\" commented co-founder Peter Venkman (54), chuckling as he reminded us that the original Ghostbusters office opened in June 1983. \"It took a year for everything to come together and get the movie made\" Venkman continued. \"We even got to go out to Hollywood and advise on the script.\"\n\n\"Yeah. They wanted our advice as long as they didn't have to change anything.\" Winston Zeddemore (56) interjected.\n\n\"But we've just about given up trying to remind people of that.\" Venkman continued. \"Of course, our franchising operation really did start in 1984, so it's okay. Ah, well, it means we got to throw a huge party two years in a row--so where's the downside?\"\n\nIt can be said to have started in 1973, when Venkman was a freshman at Columbia University and was dormed, due to a fateful administrative mix-up, with physics prodigy Egon Spengler (now 51). The unlikely friendship later included the third Ghostbuster founder, Ray Stantz (49), and Micheal Draverhaven (52), who has been tragically confined to the Albany Psychological Corrections Center since a freak lab accident in 1979. Venkman, Stantz, and Spengler later went on to work for the University, specifically the Psychology Department, and were given a research facility at Weaver Hall.\n\nIn 1983, at the end of the spring semester, Venkman, Spengler, and Stantz were fired by Columbia University and went into business for themselves, in short order hiring Zeddemore (as fourth Ghostbuster) and secretary Janine Melnitz (50) (Now married to Spengler). Their first case culminated in a battle with a Sumerian god taking the form of the Stay Puft Marshmallow Man and the destruction of several floors of the Shandor Building at Central Park West.\n\nDespite a booming business in those early years, and the creation of franchising body Ghostbusters International, the Ghostbusters found themselves in legal trouble. In 1986, shortly after several rather public setbacks, including being nearly driven out of business by would-be competitor Grossjuck Industries and their \"Robo Buster\", the fivesome was forced to accept a settlement that included a judicial restraining order barring them from acting as \"professional paranormal investigators and eliminators\"\n\nThat changed two years later, in late 1988, and the Ghostbusters returned for their second period of business, retaining the services of legal and financial advisor Louis B. Tully (52). The aforementioned movie sequel soon followed, and in several high profile cases the Ghostbusters became involved in a public feud with journalist Julio Ramanajan (now with Fox News), and a political football during the 1989 mayoral election, with Republican candidate Arnie Lapinski at first embracing, then trying to undermine, the famous team. It got so heated that, at one point, rumors suggested Venkman had considered running for mayor himself on the New York State Independent Party ticket (When Venkman declined, the NYSIP nominated Jock Mulligan, who went on to win the election and serve one controversial term in office).\n\nThe second heyday of the franchise turned out to be as transitory as the first. But it wasn't legal action against them that closed the doors of the former Hook and Ladder #8 in September 1991--it was a massive slowdown in business caused, Professor Spengler says, by a drought of the Earth's \"ectosphere\". Some interpersonal frictions reached a flash point after Melnitz was injured in a car accident, and the company was dissolved shortly after. The Ghostbusters scattered in separate directions, and in some cases had no contact with each other for some six years afterward.\n\nBut when things turned around in 1997, the third and most successful life of the fabled company began. Older now, the four original Ghostbuster have turned over most day-to-day activities of the company to the four proteges they hired in 1997, the foursome sometimes referred to as the \"Extreme Ghostbusters\": Roland Jackson (31), Kylie Griffin (31), Garrett Miller (31), and Eduardo Rivera (30). While the original Ghostbusters sometimes accompany the younger group on busts (Stantz being the most likely to do so), they seldom go into action as a team anymore--the 2002 trip to England, where they saved then-Prime Minister Tony Blair, and last year's battle with an entity Venkman refers to as \"The Doom Cat\" being notable exceptions.\n\nThey oversee a thriving franchising body, a revived GBI, squarely under the guiding hand of Venkman (the company CEO) and Tully (CFO), as well as Director of Ghostbuting Operations Richard Roy (31) (formerly of GBI's New Jersey Franchise). Successful franchises (and the lists that follow are far from comprehensive) are found in many parts of the world, from England's Ghostbusters UK, to Australia's Sidney City Ghostbusters. The United States still sees the largest number of franchises, from Virginia's Ghostbusters Virginia, Philadelphia's Ghostbusters Doom Patrol, Ghostbusters Chicago Division, Los Angeles's Ghostbusters West Coast Division, to Tampa's Ghostbusters South Coast Division, and many more in-between. New York City itself now hosts three Ghostbusters offices: in addition to the original facility in Tribeca, there are the rowdy, Brooklyn-based Ghostbusters Nightsquad and the somewhat mysterious Ghostbusters Arcane Division.\n\nShortly after the 1991 break-up, Venkman married cellist Dana Barrett (now 53), and raised her son from a previous marriage as his own: Oscar Venkman (21) (born Oscar Wallance) is the lead singer of the hot new band Mood Slime, which debuted to great fanfare and multimillion copy sales of their 2007 debut Killerwatt. The Venkmans also have a daughter, Jessica (16). During his hiatus from Ghostbusting, Venkman formed his own talent agency; he is credited for discovering actress Catherine Bartholomew and was a close friend of the late director Jon Dennison, who died in 2003. Venkman still maintains ties to the entertainment industry, and has been credited with helping convince actor Bill Murray to participate in the upcoming video game and possible movie. \"Bill is great at playing me.\" Venkman admits. \"Even though he doesn't really look anything like me--it's all in the attitude. He has that nailed.\"\n\nRay Stantz taught at Stanford after the 1991 break-up, before being fired after a laboratory accident. He married legal historian Elizabeth Hawthorne (48) in 1995, and they have a son, Eric (12). Stantz seems quite proud of his wife and son, but didn't really want to talk about them much \"on the record\" for privacy reasons. Having never been depicted in any of the Ghostbusters-related media, they've managed to avoid the searing spotlight, and Stantz appears to prefer keeping it that way."
