        "text": "Tomorrow is the first day of (checks Google) Ghostbusters Fan Fest, apparently, and Jason Reitman has teased a \"little surprise\" from his upcoming sequel to celebrate. But Sigourney Weaver must have gotten a little too excited about this whole deal because she turned into a real Chatty Cathy during an interview in the latest issue of Parade, where she let this slip:\n\nShe’s also set to reunite with Bill Murray and Dan Aykroyd in the new Ghostbusters, due July 2020. ‘It’s going to be crazy working with the guys again!’ she says. She won’t reveal any details except to confirm she’s reprising her role as hauntee Dana Barrett.\n\nThat's definitely new information. Not only is Sigourney Weaver reprising her role as Dana in the upcoming Ghostbusters movie (bring back Zuul, you cowards), but it seems that Bill Murray's casting has also been confirmed. For those keeping track at home: Ernie Hudson and Annie Potts seem to be the only remaining OG cast members who have yet to join the new sequel/reboot/whatever we're calling these things now. (Rick Moranis is, obviously, completely out of the question.)"
