He was the third of eight children to John Shakespeare, an alderman and a successful glover, and Mary Arden, the daughter of an affluent landowning farmer. Although records of his early education are sparse, it is believed he attended the King's New School in Stratford, known for its classical curriculum. Shakespeare's literary career began around 1585, when he started writing plays and sonnets. His work was divided into three periods: the first period marked by romantic comedies and histories such as A Midsummer Night's Dream and Richard III; the second characterized by tragedies including Hamlet, Othello, and Macbeth; and the third showcasing tragicomedies or romances like \"The Tempest\". His plays are noted for their exceptional use of language and varied themes, from love and betrayal to ambition and madness. In 1594, Shakespeare co-founded the Lord Chamberlain's Men, a company of actors, which later became the King's Men in 1603. He was not only a member but also the primary playwright. His works were performed at the Globe Theatre, a playhouse built by the company in 1599. Despite retiring around 1612, Shakespeare's influence on literature and theatre persists. His works continue to be studied, performed, and appreciated worldwide, securing his place as an enduring symbol of literary brilliance.\n\nBirthplace : Evanston, Illinois, USA\n\nBorn in 1950, Bill Murray is an American actor, comedian, and writer renowned for his deadpan delivery style. Raised in Wilmette, Illinois, Murray was one of nine children in a large Irish Catholic family. He discovered his passion for performing arts during his high school years, which led him to join the Second City comedy troupe in Chicago. In 1974, he moved to New York City and became a featured player on The National Lampoon Radio Hour, a comedy program that was a launching pad for many Saturday Night Live (SNL) performers. Murray's breakthrough came in 1975 when he was cast in NBC's SNL, replacing Chevy Chase. His distinctive comedic approach quickly made him a fan favorite. After leaving SNL in 1980, Murray transitioned into film, where he continued to make his mark. Some of his most iconic roles include the quirky scientist Dr. Peter Venkman in Ghostbusters and the cynical TV weatherman Phil Connors in Groundhog Day. While primarily known for his comedic roles, Murray has also demonstrated considerable range as an actor. His performance in the 2003 film Lost in Translation earned him a Golden Globe and a BAFTA Award for Best Actor, and he was nominated for an Academy Award. Aside from acting, Murray is also a part-time restaurateur and co-owner of the minor league baseball team, the Charleston RiverDogs. Despite his fame, he has remained notoriously private, eschewing the typical Hollywood lifestyle for a more low-key existence.\n\nBirthplace : Hope, Arkansas, USA\n\nBorn on August 19, 1946, in Hope, Arkansas, William Jefferson Clinton, better known as Bill Clinton, emerged from humble beginnings to become a prominent figure in American politics. Despite facing numerous challenges and controversies during his lifetime, Clinton's tenacity and charisma have cemented his legacy as one of America's most influential leaders. Clinton's political career began with his election as the Attorney General of Arkansas in 1976, followed by his tenure as Governor of Arkansas from 1979 to 1981 and 1983 to 1992. His ability to connect with people from all walks of life, coupled with his commitment to economic growth and social justice, propelled him to national fame. In 1992, Clinton made history when he was elected the 42nd President of the United States, becoming the first Democrat since Franklin D. Roosevelt to win a second term. His presidency was marked by significant accomplishments, including economic prosperity, welfare reform, and initiatives for environmental protection. However, Clinton's time in office was not without its share of controversy. His second term was marred by the Monica Lewinsky scandal, which led to his impeachment by the House of Representatives in 1998. Despite this, Clinton left office with the highest end-of-office approval rating of any U.S. President since World War II, highlighting the complexity of his legacy. After leaving the White House, Clinton remained active in public life, establishing the Clinton Foundation and becoming an influential global humanitarian.\n\nBirthplace : Washington, D.C., USA\n\nBill Nye, popularly known as \"The Science Guy\", is an eminent television presenter, science communicator, and mechanical engineer. Nye's passion for science was ignited at a young age, leading him to pursue a Mechanical Engineering degree at Cornell University, where he graduated in 1977. After a spell working as an engineer at Boeing, his career took a dramatic twist when he won a Steve Martin look-alike contest and began moonlighting as a stand-up comedian. Combining his love for comedy with his scientific background, he started making appearances on a local sketch comedy show in Seattle, Almost Live, where his famous Bill Nye the Science Guy character was born. Nye's fame skyrocketed in the 1990s when he became the host of the educational television program Bill Nye the Science Guy. The show was lauded for its creative approach to presenting complex scientific concepts to children, earning Nye a total of 18 Emmy Awards. Nye's charismatic and enthusiastic persona and his knack for simplifying science helped cement his status as one of the most influential science educators of his generation. Beyond his television career, Nye has been an indefatigable advocate for science education and the environment. He served as the executive director of The Planetary Society, the world's largest space-interest group, from 2000 to 2010, and later as its CEO. He has written several children's books on science, hosted various science programs, and even made guest appearances on popular television series like The Big Bang Theory. Nye's contributions to science and education have left an indelible mark on society, making him a celebrated icon in the world of edutainment.\n\nBirthplace : Seattle, Washington, USA\n\nWilliam Henry Gates III, popularly known as Bill Gates, was born on October 28, 1955, in Seattle, Washington. Raised in an upper-middle-class family with a deep emphasis on education, Gates was an outstanding student and showed early signs of competitiveness and innovative thinking. His fascination with computers began at Lakeside School when he was just 13, and it was here that he met Paul Allen, his future business partner. The duo spent much of their time exploring the potential of these machines, fostering a passion that would shape their future. In 1975, Gates dropped out of Harvard University to co-found Microsoft with Allen. This decision marked the beginning of a new chapter in the history of technology. Microsoft's first product was a version of the programming language BASIC for the Altair 8800, an early personal computer. However, it was the development of the MS-DOS operating system in the early 1980s, commissioned by IBM for its personal computer, that catapulted Microsoft to global prominence. Under Gates' leadership, Microsoft became synonymous with personal computing and set the standard for user-friendly software. In addition to his technological prowess, Gates is also known for his philanthropic work. In 2000, he and his ex-wife, Melinda Gates, established the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, which has since become one of the world's most influential charitable organizations. The foundation focuses on improving people's health and giving them the chance to lift themselves out of hunger and extreme poverty. Despite stepping down from his active role at Microsoft, Gates continues to inspire millions with his vision for a better world and his relentless pursuit of innovative solutions to some of the world's most pressing challenges.\n\nBirthplace : Bronx, New York, USA\n\nBilly Joel, born William Martin Joel on May 9, 1949, in the Bronx, New York, is a renowned American musician, singer-songwriter, and composer. His musical journey began at a young age when he started piano lessons at his mother's behest, laying the foundation for what would become an illustrious career. An alumnus of Hicksville High School in Long Island, Joel's high school years were marked by a growing passion for music that culminated in him joining the Echoes, a British Invasion cover band, even before his graduation. Joel's breakthrough came in 1973 with the release of Piano Man, a song that not only became his first major hit but also earned him his nickname. This song solidified his reputation as a gifted storyteller capable of capturing the human experience through his lyrics. Throughout the 1970s and 1980s, he released a series of successful albums including The Stranger and 52nd Street, both of which topped the U.S. album charts. His ability to seamlessly blend various musical styles, from pop and rock to jazz and classical, resulted in a diverse discography that appealed to a broad audience. Beyond his success in the music industry, Joel's life has been characterized by resilience in the face of personal and professional challenges. His battles with substance abuse and high-profile divorces have been well-documented, yet he has continued to create music and perform, demonstrating an unwavering commitment to his craft. In recognition of his contributions to music, Joel was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1999 and received the Kennedy Center Honors in 2013."
