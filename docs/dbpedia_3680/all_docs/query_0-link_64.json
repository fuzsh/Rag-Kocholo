The halo transitional brown dwarfs‚ÄìLABEL:lastpage\n\n1 Introduction\n\nThe formation of brown dwarfs that have masses below the hydrogen-burning minimum mass (HBMM) was predicted over a half century ago (Kumar, 1963; Hayashi & Nakano, 1963). Modern evolutionary models indicate that the HBMMs are between 0.07 and 0.092 M‚äô from solar to primordial metallicity (Baraffe et al., 2015; Burrows et al., 2001). One of the motivations to find these brown dwarfs was the potential of a new celestial population with masses between stars and planets to test stellar/substellar formation theory.\n\nA few thousand ultracool dwarfs have been identified spectroscopically since the 1990s. To better understand the physics of stellar nuclear ignition and the inner structure of objects across the stellar‚Äìsubstellar boundary (Chabrier & Baraffe, 1997), it is crucial to distinguish between stars and brown dwarfs with mass around the HBMM. However, evolution leads to mass/age degeneracy when considering the luminosity and effective temperature (TeffsubscriptùëáeffT_{\\rm eff}) of very low-mass star and brown dwarf populations. Therefore, it takes a lot of efforts to assess the substellar status of field ultracool dwarfs near the HBMM (e.g. Dieterich et al., 2014; Dupuy & Liu, 2017).\n\nBrown dwarfs in the thick disc and halo have lower level of mass/age degeneracy than those in the thin disc, as they have similar ages to the stellar populations in the thick disc (‚àºsimilar-to\\sim 8‚Äì10 Gyr; Reddy, Lambert, & Allende Prieto, 2006; Kilic et al., 2017) and the halo (‚àºsimilar-to\\sim 10‚Äì13 Gyr; Dotter et al., 2010; Jofr√© & Weiss, 2011), and they have evolved to a stage with slowed-down of cooling. However, they are distributed in a wide range of metallicity and have different HBMMs at different metallicities. Therefore, the metallicity measurements offer significant scope to tackle the mass/metallicity degeneracy problem for thick disc and halo brown dwarfs.\n\nIn the first paper of a series under the title ‚ÄòPrimeval very low-mass stars and brown dwarfs‚Äô, we defined a new classification scheme for L subdwarfs and characterized a sample of 22 metal-deficient ultracool subdwarfs (Zhang et al., 2017a, hereafter Paper I). In the second paper of the series we assessed the stellar‚Äìsubstellar boundary in the TeffsubscriptùëáeffT_{\\rm eff} versus [Fe/H] plane based on theoretical model prediction of the HBMM (Zhang et al., 2017b, hereafter Paper II). This provided an alternative method to assess substellar status for nearby ultracool subdwarfs, and revealed a ‚Äòhalo brown dwarf transition zone‚Äô representing a narrow mass range in which unsteady nuclear fusion occurs ‚Äì a ‚Äòsubstellar subdwarf gap‚Äô for mid L to early T types. Currently, there are six L subdwarfs known in this transition zone: SDSS J010448.46+153501.8 (Lodieu et al. 2017; Paper II), 2MASS J05325346+8246465 (Burgasser et al., 2003), 2MASS J06164006‚àí-6407194 (2M0616; Cushing et al., 2009), SDSS J125637.13‚àí-022452.4 (SD1256; Sivarani et al., 2009), ULAS J151913.03‚àí-000030.0 (UL1519; Paper I), and 2MASS J16262034+3925190 (2M1626; Burgasser, 2004a).\n\nThis is the third paper of the series following Paper I and Paper II, in which we grow the halo transitional brown dwarf population further, presenting the discovery of three new members. The observations are presented in Section 2. Section 3 presents constraints on the physical characteristics of these objects. Finally Section 4 presents a summary and conclusions.\n\n3 Characteristics\n\n3.1 Spectral classification\n\nWe classify UL0208, UL2307 and UL1350 following our L subdwarf classification scheme (Paper I). L subdwarfs are classified into three metallicity subclasses, subdwarf (sdL), extreme subdwarf (esdL), and ultra-subdwarf (usdL), based on their optical-to-NIR spectra. The classification scheme was set up such that the subclass sequence follows a decreasing trend in metallicity. The overall profiles of L subdwarfs respond to both TeffsubscriptùëáeffT_{\\rm eff} and metallicity. The overall optical-to-infrared spectral energy distribution becomes bluer for both warmer TeffsubscriptùëáeffT_{\\rm eff} and/or lower metallicity; however, features such as the 705‚Äì730 and 840‚Äì860 nm TiO bands are specifically metal-sensitive (see table 3 in Paper I).\n\nThe population of known L subdwarfs with good-quality optical-to-NIR spectra does not fully populate every subclass/subtype in the scheme, so we followed a two-stage approach. First we compared our target spectra to those of the available classified subdwarfs and identified objects that provided a reasonable match (in terms of overall morphology and important spectral features). Then we considered each match in more detail, and made decisions about optimal choice and any intermediate classifications.\n\nThere were four classified subdwarfs (with good optical-to-NIR spectra) that gave reasonable matches to our three objects. These were the esdL6 2M0616 (Cushing et al., 2009), the usdL3 SD1256 (Sivarani et al., 2009), the esdL4 UL1519 (Paper I) and the usdL4 2M1626 (Burgasser, 2004a). Figs 1 and 2 show the optical and NIR spectra of our objects (UL0208, UL2307, and UL1350) compared to those of the four classified L subdwarfs.\n\nAs can be seen, UL0208 has a similar optical spectrum to the usdL3 SD1256, however, it has slightly less flux at 720‚Äì770 nm indicating a higher metallicity. Also, compared to the esdL UL1519, UL0208 has slightly more flux at 780‚Äì810 nm, weaker TiO absorption at around 840‚Äì860 nm, and stronger NIR suppression, indicating a slightly lower metallicity than UL1519. Comparison between the optical spectra of UL0208 and 2M1626 shows that UL0208 has an earlier spectral type (SpT) than 2M1626. Therefore we classify UL0208 as an esdL3 subdwarf.\n\nThe optical spectrum of UL2307 appears to be intermediate between those of the usdL4 2M1626 and the esdL6 2M0616 (see Fig. 1). However, its NIR spectrum is significantly more suppressed than that of these subdwarfs, with an overall optical-to-NIR morphology that is closer to 2M1626 than to 2M0616. We therefore assign UL2307 the same subclass as 2M1626. Having said this, UL2307 has slightly less flux in the optical and slightly more flux in the NIR compared to 2M1626, which leads us to assign it a slightly later subtype. We classified UL2307 as a usdL4.5 subdwarf.\n\nFig. 1 shows that both UL0208 and Ul2307 have very different optical spectral features (e.g. TiO) from the standard L3 dwarf DENIS-P J1058.7‚àí-1548 (DE1058; Delfosse et al., 1997; Kirkpatrick et al., 1999) and L4.5 dwarf 2MASS J2224438‚àí-015853 (2M2224; Kirkpatrick et al., 2000) because of their much lower metallicity. Metallicity has a stronger influence on the spectral profile of L subdwarfs in the NIR than in the optical (e.g. fig. 9 in Paper I).\n\nUL1350 was originally classified as sdL5 by Lodieu et al. (2010) based on a low SNR optical spectrum, but was then re-classified sdL3.5‚Äì4 based on an improved SNR optical spectrum (Lodieu et al., 2017). In Paper I, we suggested that UL1350 should have the same spectral type as SD1256 (usdL3). And here we are now able to assess the full optical-NIR spectra. These spectra (shown in Figures 1 and 2) show that UL1350 has an optical-to-NIR morphology that is very similar to SD1256, and we thus classify UL1350 as usdL3.\n\n3.2 Halo kinematics\n\nWe derived spectroscopic distance estimates for UL0208, UL1350, and UL2307 using the relationship between spectral type and JùêΩJ- and HùêªH-band absolute magnitude shown in fig. 16 of Paper I. We computed distances using both JùêΩJ and HùêªH band magnitudes which for all three sources agreed within the uncertainties; the average distances are listed in Table 1. Upper and lower limits were determined by considering the JùêΩJ and HùêªH band constraints, and positive and negative error bars were assigned for each object.\n\nProper motions were determined using multi-epoch optical and NIR data. UL0208, UL1350, and UL2307 were observed by SDSS on 2009 September 27, 2003 April 27 and 2008 October 02, respectively. They were subsequently observed by UKIDSS and Pan-STARRS1 (PS1; Chambers et al., 2016). Multi-epoch PS1 images of each target were combined, with mean epochs of 2012 July 31, 2011 March 12, and 2012 October 23, for UL0208, UL1350, and UL2307, respectively. The proper motions of UL0208 and UL1350 were measured using SDSS zùëßz- and PS1 zùëßz-band images which had baselines of 2.84 and 7.88 yr respectively, following the method described in section 3.2 of Paper II. The proper motion of UL2307 was measured from PS1 zùëßz- and UKIDSS JùêΩJ-band images which provided a baseline of 3.20 yr. The numbers of reference stars used for proper motion measurements were 22, 9 and 9 for UL0208, UL1350, and UL2307, respectively. Our measured proper motions are listed in Table 1.\n\nWe measured RVs for UL0208, UL2307 and UL1350 by cross correlation of their X-shooter optical and NIR spectra to that of an DE1441 which has a RV of ‚àí27.9¬±1.2plus-or-minus27.91.2-27.9\\pm 1.2 km s-1 (Bailer-Jones, 2004). We smoothed our original X-shooter spectra by 21 pixels in the VIS and 11 pixels in the NIR to increase the SNR. The RV differences between our objects and the standard were measured with the IRAF task FXCOR. Then the RVs were corrected for the barycentric effects. The final RVs of UL0208, UL2307 and UL1350 are listed in Table 1.\n\nThe Galactic U‚ÄãV‚ÄãWùëàùëâùëäUVW space motions of UL0208, UL2307 and UL1350 were determined using our spectroscopic distances, RVs and proper motions following Clarke et al. (2010). The resulting U,VùëàùëâU,V and WùëäW velocities are listed in Table 1. UL0208, UL2307 and UL1350 have typical halo kinematics (see fig. 17 of Paper I), in keeping with their low metallicity making them halo members with ages of ‚àºsimilar-to\\sim 10‚Äì13 Gyr (Dotter et al., 2010; Jofr√© & Weiss, 2011).\n\nWe calculated the halo membership probabilities of these three objects based on kinematics and population fractions of thin disc (0.93), thick disc (0.07) and halo (0.006) stars in the solar neighbourhood (Reddy, Lambert, & Allende Prieto, 2006). UL1350 and UL2307 have halo membership probabilities of 99.9% and 99.1%, respectively. UL0208 has a higher thick disc probability (82.9%) and a lower halo probability (17.1%), as the thick disc fraction is ‚àºsimilar-to\\sim 10 times higher than the halo fraction. UL0208 would have a halo probability of 70.1% if we applied an equal fraction of halo and thick disc populations in the calculation. The halo membership of UL0208 becomes robust when considering its typical halo metallicity of [Fe/H] = ‚àí-1.5.\n\n3.3 Atmospheric properties\n\nWe used the BT-Dusty models (Allard, Homeier, & Freytag, 2014) to constrain the atmospheric parameters of UL0208, UL1350, and UL2307. The model grids we used cover 1900 K ‚â§Teff‚â§absentsubscriptùëáeffabsent\\leq T_{\\rm eff}\\leq 3500 K, ‚àí2.5‚â§2.5absent-2.5\\leq [Fe/H] ‚â§‚àí1.0absent1.0\\leq-1.0 and 5.0 ‚â§\\leq log gùëîg ‚â§\\leq 5.5, with intervals of 100 K for TeffsubscriptùëáeffT_{\\rm eff}, 0.5 dex for [Fe/H], and 0.5 dex for log gùëîg. Linear interpolation between some model spectra was used if this yielded a significantly improved fit. We followed the procedure described in section 3.3 of Paper II to find best-fitting model spectra to our sources.\n\nFig. 3 shows the optical and NIR spectra of UL0208, Ul1350, and UL2307 compared to their best-fitting models. These best-fitting models have TeffsubscriptùëáeffT_{\\rm eff} = 2250 K and [Fe/H] = ‚àí-1.5 for UL0208; TeffsubscriptùëáeffT_{\\rm eff} = 2250 K and [Fe/H] = ‚àí-1.8 for UL1350; TeffsubscriptùëáeffT_{\\rm eff} = 2050 K and [Fe/H] = ‚àí-1.7 for UL2307. All these models have gravity of log gùëîg = 5.50 and Œ±ùõº\\alpha enhancement of [Œ±ùõº\\alpha/Fe] = +0.4. These model spectra in general provide a very good fit to the data with the exception of the 840‚Äì880 nm region, where the TiO, CrH, and FeH absorption bands are less well fitted.\n\nWe have combined our new TeffsubscriptùëáeffT_{\\rm eff} values with those from Paper I and Paper II, and extended this sample with an additional 50 K6.5‚ÄìM5.5 subdwarfs in the ‚àí2.0‚â§2.0absent-2.0\\leq [Fe/H] ‚â§‚àí1.0absent1.0\\leq-1.0 range. Using this sample, we have updated the polynomial fit for the relationship between ultracool subdwarf SpT and TeffsubscriptùëáeffT_{\\rm eff}, which follows:\n\nTeff=3701‚àí108.6√óS‚Äãp‚ÄãT+1.855√óS‚Äãp‚ÄãT2‚àí0.1661√óS‚Äãp‚ÄãT3subscriptùëáeff3701108.6ùëÜùëùùëá1.855ùëÜùëùsuperscriptùëá20.1661ùëÜùëùsuperscriptùëá3T_{\\rm eff}=3701-108.6\\times SpT+1.855\\times SpT^{2}-0.1661\\times SpT^{3} (1)\n\nwith a root mean square (rms) of 32 K. In this equation SpT = ‚àí-1 for K7, SpT = 0 for M0, SpT = 10 for L0 and SpT = 15 for L5 (etc). Equation 1 is valid for K7‚ÄìL7 subdwarfs with [Fe/H] ‚â≤‚àí1.0less-than-or-similar-toabsent1.0\\la-1.0.\n\nFigure 4 shows the SpT‚ÄìTeffsubscriptùëáeffT_{\\rm eff} relationships of dwarf populations with different metallicities. Objects with lower metallicity tend to have lower TeffsubscriptùëáeffT_{\\rm eff} before M3 and higher TeffsubscriptùëáeffT_{\\rm eff} from M5 to L7 types. M6‚ÄìL7 subdwarfs with [Fe/H] ‚â§‚àí1.0absent1.0\\leq-1.0 are ‚àºsimilar-to\\sim 200‚Äì400 K warmer than field dwarfs. The SpT‚ÄìTeffsubscriptùëáeffT_{\\rm eff} relation for young L dwarfs is in general somewhat cooler (by ‚àºsimilar-to\\sim 200 K) than the field relation, and is thus offset in the opposite sense to the subdwarf fit. The large difference between these SpT‚ÄìTeffsubscriptùëáeffT_{\\rm eff} relationships is due to different SpT‚Äìmass correlations, opacities, and ages of these populations. A metal-poor star would have a lower opacity, higher TeffsubscriptùëáeffT_{\\rm eff}, and bluer spectral continuum than a solar-metallicity star with the same mass, and thus could have the same spectral subtype as more massive stars with higher metallicities (fig. 9; Paper II). Dwarf stars have higher mass than subdwarfs with the same spectral type before ‚àºsimilar-to\\sim M6 and a sharper mass decline from M3 to M5 types (Mann et al., 2015). Then subdwarfs start to have higher masses from M7 to L types. Meanwhile, young ultracool dwarfs have much lower masses than field objects but retain a warm TeffsubscriptùëáeffT_{\\rm eff} at young ages.\n\n3.4 Halo transitional brown dwarfs\n\nEvolutionary models (Baraffe et al., 1997; Chabrier & Baraffe, 1997; Burrows et al., 1998) show that there is a halo brown dwarf transition zone in a TeffsubscriptùëáeffT_{\\rm eff} versus [Fe/H] plane, which is between ‚àºsimilar-to\\sim1200 K and the corresponding TeffsubscriptùëáeffT_{\\rm eff} (‚àºsimilar-to\\sim 2200‚Äì3000 K) of the HBMM at different metallicities (Paper II). Six L subdwarfs have previously been identified as members of this transition zone. They are supported by electron degeneracy and unsteady nuclear ignition takes place in their cores, but they cannot balance ongoing gravitational contraction. These halo transitional brown dwarfs are fully convective and could sporadically reach states of minimum temperature and pressure in their cores to fuse hydrogen. The unsteady hydrogen fusion in halo transitional brown dwarfs is less efficient and could last longer than the steady hydrogen fusion in least-massive stars which would have a main sequence lifetime of ‚àºsimilar-to\\sim 12 trillion years (Adams, Bodenheimer, & Laughlin, 2005).\n\nThe unsteady hydrogen fusion partially contributed to the luminosities of halo transitional brown dwarfs. Burgasser et al. (2008) show that around half of the luminosity of 2MASS J05325346+8246465 is generated from its core hydrogen fusion at 10 Gyr. The efficiency (intensity or frequency) of the unsteady sporadic hydrogen fusion is sensitive to the masses of transitional brown dwarfs, because the halo brown dwarf transition zone covers a narrow mass range (‚àºsimilar-to\\sim 90‚Äì99% HBMM) but spans wide ranges of luminosity and temperature (see figs 4 and 5 in Burrows et al., 2001). For example, an object with 0.08 M‚äô and [Fe/H] = ‚àí-2.3 would have a Teff‚âà1200subscriptùëáeff1200T_{\\rm eff}\\approx 1200 K; however, an object with 0.085 M‚äô and the same [Fe/H] would have a Teff‚âà2400subscriptùëáeff2400T_{\\rm eff}\\approx 2400 K (see Fig. 5).\n\nFigure 5 shows UL0208, UL1350, and UL2307 in the TeffsubscriptùëáeffT_{\\rm eff} versus [Fe/H] plane. They lie in the halo brown dwarf transition zone joined by six previously known members, which were identified using the method described in Paper II with atmospheric properties from Paper I. Masses of these nine halo transitional objects have been estimated from their location relative to the iso-mass contours in the diagram, and are shown in Table 3. The lowest-mass stars have stable TeffsubscriptùëáeffT_{\\rm eff} at 10‚Äì13 Gyr (e.g. fig 8 of Burrows et al., 2001), so the iso-mass contours and the TeffsubscriptùëáeffT_{\\rm eff} values of the HBMM line in Figure 5 are age-independent for halo stars. However, age uncertainty may affect our mass estimates for the halo brown dwarfs by up to 0.0005 M‚äô, because massive brown dwarf TeffsubscriptùëáeffT_{\\rm eff} drops by ‚àºsimilar-to\\sim 50‚Äì100 K from 10 Gyr to 11‚Äì13 Gyr (e.g. Baraffe et al., 2003). The mass uncertainty caused by TeffsubscriptùëáeffT_{\\rm eff} error is around 0.001 M‚äô, and the mass uncertainty caused by [Fe/H] error (0.2 dex) is around 0.008‚Äì0.001 M‚äô. The total uncertainty based on combining in quadrature is thus 0.0015 M‚äô. The mass uncertainty is thus small, and is mainly due to TeffsubscriptùëáeffT_{\\rm eff} uncertainty (since TeffsubscriptùëáeffT_{\\rm eff} is very sensitive to mass in the halo brown dwarf transition zone - a small mass change leads to a significant change in core fusion intensity).\n\nAn sdL7 subdwarf, ULAS J133836.97‚àí-022910.7 (UL1338), has TeffsubscriptùëáeffT_{\\rm eff} = 1650¬±120plus-or-minus120\\pm 120 K and [Fe/H] = ‚àí-1.0¬±plus-or-minus\\pm0.2 (Paper I), and is a brown dwarf according to fig 9 of Paper II. However, UL1338 could belong to either the thick disc or the halo population as its [Fe/H] is at the thick-disc/halo boundary. Furthermore, its [Fe/H] could be underestimated, since its NIR spectrum has low SNR and the [Fe/H] derived from the BT-Settl model fits is less reliable for [Fe/H] ‚â•‚àíabsent\\geq-1.0 than that for [Fe/H] < ‚àí-1.0. Therefore, UL1338 currently is not listed as a halo transitional brown dwarf. VVV J12564163-6202039 (VVV1256) is a high proper motion L subdwarf identified by Smith et al. (2018). It could be either an sdL7 brown dwarf or an esdL1 star by its poor-quality optical-NIR spectrum and photometric colours. Better-quality optical-NIR spectra are required to confirm the status of VVV1256 and UL1338.\n\n3.5 Lithium detection in halo brown dwarfs\n\nBrown dwarfs with solar metallicity and mass less than ‚àºsimilar-to\\sim 0.06 M‚äô do not acquire core temperatures to fuse lithium (‚â≥greater-than-or-similar-to\\ga 2.5 million K), and retain this element throughout their lives (e.g. fig 7 of Burrows et al., 2001). The lithium depletion test (Rebolo, Martin, & Magazzu, 1992; Magazzu, Martin, & Rebolo, 1993) is a robust method to confirm young or field degenerate brown dwarfs with mass below 0.06 M‚äô (e.g. Basri, Marcy, & Graham, 1996; Rebolo et al., 1996; Ruiz, Leggett, & Allard, 1997; Lodieu et al., 2015b). However, this method may be incapable of confirming old halo brown dwarfs.\n\nThe maximum core temperature of a brown dwarf with 0.06 M‚äô and [M/H] ‚â§‚àíabsent\\leq-1.0 is almost 0.2 million K below the minimum temperature to fuse lithium (fig. 10; Chabrier & Baraffe, 1997). A core temperature difference of 0.2 million K is corresponding to a mass difference of ‚àºsimilar-to\\sim 0.005 M‚äô for brown dwarfs in this mass range (fig. 2; Burrows et al., 2001). Therefore, the lithium-burning minimum mass is likely around 0.065 M‚äô at [M/H] ‚â§‚àíabsent\\leq-1.0. The Li line at 670.78 nm was not detected in the spectra of SD1256 and 2M1626 (Lodieu et al., 2015a). Note that their masses are ‚àºsimilar-to\\sim 27% higher than 0.065 M‚äô (see Table 3). Halo brown dwarfs with [M/H] ‚â§‚àíabsent\\leq-1.0 (i.e. [Fe/H] ‚â§‚àíabsent\\leq-1.3) and masses below 0.065 M‚äô would have Teff‚â≤less-than-or-similar-tosubscriptùëáeffabsentT_{\\rm eff}\\la 900 K at 10 Gyr, according to Fig. 5. Brown dwarfs with Teff‚â≤less-than-or-similar-tosubscriptùëáeffabsentT_{\\rm eff}\\la 900 K would have spectral types later than T5 (Fig. 4) and barely have flux at << 770 nm to unveil monatomic lines.\n\nLithium starts to condense into LiCl as well as LiOH and LiH in the atmospheres of brown dwarfs when temperatures drop down below ‚àºsimilar-to\\sim 1525 K, and monatomic lithium decreases in abundance with decreasing temperature (Lodders, 1999). Therefore, Li lines are not expected in the optical spectra of halo brown dwarfs, which could be either massive enough to fuse lithium to helium or cool enough to condense lithium into LiCl, LiOH, or LiH.\n\nMetal hydrides (e.g. FeH) are favoured in the atmospheres of metal-poor L subdwarfs (Paper I). Shi, Stancil, & Wang (2013) also suggest that LiH might be a better candidate for detection of lithium molecules in the mid-infrared spectra of brown dwarfs than LiCl (Weck et al., 2004). Therefore, LiH might be more important than LiCl and LiOH in halo degenerate brown dwarfs, which would have insufficient metals (e.g. Cl, O) to combine with lithium.\n\n4 Summary and conclusions\n\nWe have presented optical and NIR spectra of two new L subdwarfs (UL0208, UL2307) and a known L subdwarf (UL1350) obtained with OSIRIS and X-shooter. We classified them as esdL3, usdL4.5, and usdL3, respectively. We measured their astrometry and kinematics, and determined their TeffsubscriptùëáeffT_{\\rm eff} and [Fe/H] by fitting model spectra. We determined their mass by comparing to model iso-mass contours in the TeffsubscriptùëáeffT_{\\rm eff} versus [Fe/H] plane and found that these three objects all have masses below the HBMMs at their metallicities. They therefore join a population of nine halo transitional brown dwarfs known to date, which we summarize in Table 3.\n\nThe unsteady core hydrogen fusion in halo transitional brown dwarfs partially contributed to their luminosities and helped them to maintain intermediate luminosities and TeffsubscriptùëáeffT_{\\rm eff} between least-massive stars and degenerate brown dwarfs. Halo transitional brown dwarfs are distributed in a TeffsubscriptùëáeffT_{\\rm eff} range wider than 1000 K within a narrow mass range and naturally form a ‚Äòsubstellar subdwarf gap‚Äô. Objects in this gap have a maximum mass relative difference of ‚àºsimilar-to\\sim 10% and a maximum TeffsubscriptùëáeffT_{\\rm eff} relative difference of ‚àºsimilar-to\\sim 2.5 times. Note that a substellar gap would not be distinctly revealed by luminosity or TeffsubscriptùëáeffT_{\\rm eff} among field dwarf populations, as field transitional brown dwarfs have a relatively shorter cooling time (narrower TeffsubscriptùëáeffT_{\\rm eff} range) and a higher level of mass/age degeneracy. The substellar gap is revealed in the simulated substellar luminosity function with a halo-like birthrate but not in that with a flat birthrate (fig. 10; Burgasser, 2004b).\n\nIt is important to discover more of these halo brown dwarfs. Deep exploration of the Visible and Infrared Survey Telescope for Astronomy (VISTA; Sutherland et al., 2015) surveys and the future Euclid survey (Laureijs et al., 2011) would allow us to identify cooler halo brown dwarfs. The Euclid space mission will be particularly well suited to identifying halo brown dwarfs because it will provide NIR slit-less spectra, in addition to its deep optical and Y‚ÄãJ‚ÄãHùëåùêΩùêªYJH-band wide-angle imaging. The growing population of known transition-zone brown dwarfs can be used as a benchmark to search for halo brown dwarfs in Euclid. Meanwhile, more advanced atmospheric and evolutionary models are required to better understand cool halo brown dwarfs.\n\nAcknowledgements\n\nBased on observations made with the Gran Telescopio Canarias (GTC), installed in the Spanish Observatorio del Roque de los Muchachos of the Instituto de Astrof√≠sica de Canarias, on the island of La Palma.
