        "text": "This book promises nothing less than to revolutionize our understanding of human history. Maybe more than a revolution, however, it is a revival of the quest for political alternatives that greatly concerned earlier generations of anthropologists but significantly lost thrust in recent decades. In this vein, the book revitalizes a once constitutive interest in the Other as a potential source of dissidence against taken-for-granted pillars of our political constitution and social life. The loss of interest in the Other as an inspiration for socio-political otherness occurred in at least temporal correlation with the rise of neoliberal dogma and, even if somewhat paradoxically, reinforced its core mantra: there is no alternative. This book is full of alternatives, and maybe it is no coincidence that its protagonist is a Native American called Kandiaronk-and thus a member of the community that inspired the visions of the hippie generation. In their book, the archaeologist David Wengrow and the late anthropologist David Graeber are mainly concerned with alternative endings and twists to dominant narrations of human history. Popular elements of such narrations are agriculture and its presumed consequence in generating social hierarchies, the city as a hotbed of 'social complexity' to be tamed by means of bureaucracy, and the state as an inevitable outcome of agriculture and city life. The authors refute these popular assumptions with numerous examples from ancient history and relatively recent 'egalitarian' societies. With regard to agriculture, the authors convincingly show that not only did its practice not necessarily lead to sedentary life forms, but that it was sometimes abandoned altogether by societies that returned to more mobile forms of economy-all this in a context in which agriculture was often just one economic activity among others, and often not even the most articulate one. This leads the authors to conclude that classic classifications of societies along lines of 'hunter-gatherers', 'horticulturalists', 'pastoral nomads' etc. are anything but useful, because most societies are most of these for most of the time-often varying with the seasons. This prompts the authors to another highly important conclusion, namely that seasonality allows for political experimentation. This conclusion is developed in accordance with Marcel Mauss (1979 [1904-5]), who had already observed at the beginning of the twentieth century that the circumpolar Inuits had two political structures-a hierarchical one during the hunting season in summer, and a relatively egalitarian one\n\nIn his Taj fel Memorial lecture Gustav Jahoda (1 986) proposes that expenmental findings infrequently reflect natural laws of human action, but are reflections of cultural conventions. In developing his arguments he finds it usefil to criticize a number of m y earlier ideas (Gergen, 1982). The present paper demonstrates that this critique is not only misguided, but that i f the implications of m y earlier work had been properly elaborated neither the argument for cultural convention nor general laws could be adequately sustained. Because of the non-objective character of behavioural interpretation, neither of these positions can be empirically warranted. Their justification is more properly considered in ethical, or ideological terms. Gustave Johoda must be complimented for the tenor of debate introduced into the first Tajfel Memorial Lecture (Jahoda, 1986). Sustaining Tajfel's deep concern with the rationale and direction of the discipline, Jahoda has brought into sharp focus a range of issues critical to the manner in which we are to view our endeavours. Of paramount concern is the extent to which social psychological research succeeds in elucidating the biological (or natural) as opposed to the socio-cultural determinants of human conduct. As Jahoda correctly argues, most experimentation is social psychology presumes that it is carving nature at the joint. As it is believed, rigorous control of experimental variables, precise measurement, and sophisticated statistical designs enable the discipline to disclose the natural laws of human behaviour. Yet, as Jahoda observes, such presumptions are both culture-and history-blind. They fail to take account of the socio-cultural conditions potentially at play in the generation of the research findings. The interesting argument is then posed that many experiments cannot be replicated across cultural boundaries because the grounds upon which their intelligibility rests is not shared within other cultures. Further, even that research which can be replicated frequently demonstrates cross-cultural discontinuities. For Jahoda, the implications echo much of his previous writing: experimental social psychology misleadingly suggests that it is portraying nature while systematically obscuring the significance"
