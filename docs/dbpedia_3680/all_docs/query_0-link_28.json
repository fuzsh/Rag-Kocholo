        "text": "The Chernobyl disaster is the first global large-scale nuclear non-military disaster, which affected millions of people. As a result of the Chernobyl nuclear accident (1986), it is more than 53.500 km2 of the territory of Ukraine (almost 9% of the territory) were contaminated by radioactive materials. The most polluted area is the Chernobyl Exclusion zone (CEZ, 2600 km2). The CEZ, where radioactive contamination is highest and public access is restricted, has been declared a Biosphere Reserve\n\n(2016). The CEZ and adjacent areas are now home to at least 141 species of the Red Data Book of Ukraine (2009) including introduced European Bison (Bison bonasus) and Przewalskis Horse (Equusferus przewalskii). It is already proven return of large carnivores, like brown bear, lynx, wild cat, wolf to the area. The natural habitats of CEZ and other areas can immobilise the radioactive pollution and transform it into components, which are hard to be washed away, by time flow. The urgency of the\n\nproject is linked to climate change, which has increased substantially the wildfires and decreased groundwater table. It increases the huge risk for radioactive pollution to be spread outside. The last fires in April 2020 were catastrophic with a total area of 20% burned habitats. The part of the area has recovered mostly (like meadows and wetlands), but others need long-term rewilding support and prevention measures. Rewilding will rise more healthy wetlands and support the rare and key species and habitats, consequently, it will lower the fire risks and keep radiation localised in the CEZ and other contaminated areas."
