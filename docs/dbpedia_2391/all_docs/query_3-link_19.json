        "text": "Statistical analysis:\n\nPrimate enamelin sequences were manually assembled using Sequencher 4.2 (Gene Codes, Ann Arbor, MI). Multiple overlapping reads were aligned with the human reference sequence from the UCSC genome browser. Consensus sequences were exported, aligned using ClustalW (Higgins et al. 1996), and checked visually in Se-Al v.2.0 (Rambaut 1996). Maximum-likelihood-based methods (Yang et al. 2000) were used to detect the presence of adaptive evolution on the amino acid sequence of enamelin. These tests were implemented using CODEML in the PAML package (v. 3.15). A species tree (Boffelli et al. 2003) was used for PAML analyses.\n\nThree likelihood-ratio tests were used to examine the data for evidence of positive selection, specifically by looking for codons and/or lineages with dN/dS ratios significantly >1. The tests are classified by the way in which the data are used to construct the likelihood ratios: sites, branch, and branch-site tests (Yang 1998; Yang et al. 2000). Significance for the three tests was determined by comparing the likelihood of a null model, without selection, to the likelihood of a selection model. The test statistic, the negative of twice the log-likelihood difference (−2Δl), is compared to the χ2 distribution to determine significance, and the degrees of freedom equal the number of parameter differences between the null and selection models. The log-likelihood difference asymptotically follows a χ2 distribution, which is conservative (Anisimova et al. 2001).\n\nFor the sites test, we used two null models, the first (M1) with two dN/dS estimates, one to be <1 and the other equal to 1, and the second (M7) with dN/dS values estimated between 0 and 1 from a beta distribution. Both corresponding selection models included an additional class of sites with an unrestricted dN/dS estimated from the data (M2 and M8). If the dN/dS ratio for the additional class of sites is estimated to be >1 we compare the M8 likelihood to that in M8a, the model in which the unrestricted dN/dS is set to 1 (Swanson et al. 2003). For the M8a vs. M8 comparison, the appropriate test statistic is unknown; however, our test statistic meets the 1% critical value for two different distributions (Wong et al. 2004). We also implemented a test for variation between sites; the test compares a model with no variation between sites (M0) to a model that allows variation between sites (M3). For the branch test, the null model, a phylogenetic tree without selection, a single dN/dS for the entire tree (M0) is compared to a selection model that allows the dN/dS ratio to vary along each branch (free ratio). Finally, the branch-site test was conducted by defining branches as foreground and background lineages; the foreground lineages are those on which an a priori hypothesis of adaptive evolution exists (Zhang et al. 2005)—in our case one based upon diet switch. The selection model allows dN/dS ratios to fall into one of three site classes: dN/dS between 0 and 1, dN/dS = 1, and dN/dS freely estimated for the foreground lineages only. The null model is one in which the foreground lineages freely estimated dN/dS ratio is set to 1. Selection is inferred if the freely estimated dN/dS ratio is >1 and the likelihood of the model is significantly greater than that of the null model. A Bayes empirical Bayes approach was used to calculate posterior probabilities that sites with dN/dS > 1 were subject to positive selection (Yang et al. 2005). The proportions of sites with the corresponding dN/dS (ω) values are labeled p1, p2, p3 or pfg (foreground), and pbg (background), depending on the test. The tests were conducted without removing sites with ambiguous data. We checked for convergence by repeating the analyses with various initial dN/dS values.\n\nSequence data from the human panel were automatically base called, assembled, and scanned for SNPs using Phred, Phrap, and polyPhred (Nickerson et al. 1997; Ewing and Green 1998; Ewing et al. 1998) and visually inspected using Consed (Gordon et al. 1998). The finished sequence was exported and haplotypes were inferred using PHASE (Stephens et al. 2001). Estimation of population genetic parameters and tests of neutrality were performed using DnaSP v. 4.0 (Rozas and Rozas 1999).\n\nWe used the statistical test Tajima's D (Tajima 1989) to quantify population genetic variation to identify deviations from expectations under the neutral theory of evolution (Kimura 1968). Tajima's D compares nucleotide polymorphism (θ) and nucleotide diversity (π), two estimates of 4Neμ (Ne is the effective population size, μ is the mutation rate), to identify deviations from neutrality. The test compares the relative abundance of low- and high-frequency polymorphisms. A selective sweep is predicted to eliminate nucleotide variation in the region, and as generations progress, mutations occur randomly throughout the swept region, leading to an excess of alleles that are found in very few individuals in a sample (rare alleles). A negative value of Tajima's D indicates an excess of rare alleles in the sample population, which can be caused by either recovery from a population bottleneck or a recent selective sweep. We used two methods to determine the significance of Tajima's D values. First, we used a standard coalescent with constant population size, as implemented in DnaSP (Rozas and Rozas 1999). We also generated simulations using the cosi simulation package, which has been calibrated to human sequence variation with populations similar to our samples (Schaffner et al. 2005). We generated 10,000 simulations using the parameters specified by Schaffner et al. (2005), except those specific to the enamelin region: recombination rate of 0.6 cm/Mb, length of 9500 bp, and 20 mutation sites. The recombination rate for the region is the sex-averaged recombination rate estimated by deCODE Genetics (Kong et al. 2002).\n\nWe used several programs to predict whether amino acid substitutions may have functional consequences: PolyPhen, SIFT, and PANTHER (Ramensky et al. 2002; Ng and Henikoff 2003; Brunham et al. 2005). The programs use sequence variability to predict how nucleotide substitutions affect protein function in a manner similar to a position-specific scoring matrix.\n\nHuman variation:\n\nWe examined nucleotide variation at the enamelin locus to confirm that direct sequence data support the signature of selection observed in genome scans and that evidence for positive selection at this locus is not a result of ascertainment and/or genotyping biases. Analysis of nucleotide variation reveals that a majority of the 32 SNPs identified at the enamelin locus are absent or at low frequency in all populations except the south Saharan Africans ( and ). Low levels of nucleotide variation in the populations outside of south Saharan Africa are consistent with a selective sweep at this locus. Tajima's D values calculated using the resequenced data from the European population are not consistent with neutrality, indicating a recent selective sweep (P < 0.01, ). We used both a standard equilibrium model and simulations calibrated to human demographic history (Schaffner et al. 2005) to test for significance. The Asian and South American populations show evidence of a selective sweep; however, while the sample sizes are large (n = 40 and 20, respectively), lack of variation in these populations precludes statistical significance.\n\nNine of the 32 SNPs are located in enamelin exons; of these, 6 are nonsynonymous and cause an amino acid change. Only 2 of the 6 nonsynonymous SNPs were identified in more than one individual ( ). For the SNP notation, the first letter is the ancestral allele, the number corresponds to the location from the first base in the 5′-UTR, and the second letter is the derived allele. The ancestral allele was determined by comparing the SNP to the orthologous position in the chimpanzee and rhesus genomes. The nonsynonymous SNP C14625T is at high frequency for the derived allele in the populations outside of south Saharan Africa (0.965). The derived allele is found at a frequency of 0.269 in the combined south Saharan African population (6/18 alleles in the sub-Saharan African panel and 1/8 in the Mbuti tribe). We evaluated the Fay and Wu's H (denoted Hasc) test statistic calculated by Voight et al. (2006) for the enamelin SNPs genotyped in the International HapMap Project (International HapMap Consortium 2005). Hasc is calculated for 50-marker windows and compared to a genomic empirical distribution. The enamelin SNPs in Northern and Western Europeans with calculated Hasc are all significantly negative (P = 0.05); additionally, all SNPs in the Asian combined population have a negative Hasc, and one meets the 5% significance cutoff. The two high-frequency nonsynonymous SNPs are located in prevalent enamelin cleavage products: SNP C14625T is located at amino acid 648, which is in the 25-kDa cleavage product, and SNP G14970A is at amino acid 763, which is found in the 34-kDa cleavage product.\n\nThe nonsynonymous high-frequency derived polymorphism C14625T results in a change from a polar residue to a nonpolar residue, specifically threonine to isoleucine. All primates sequenced in this study and species with enamelin sequence available online (including pig, cow, rat, and mouse) have threonine at the corresponding position. Evidence for lack of variation at the residue and the observed polarity-changing polymorphism suggest that the nonconservative change to an isoleucine may affect enamel formation, and therefore thickness. Methods used to predict the effects of nonsynonymous polymorphisms infer that the SNP in question may affect protein function; however, there is no three-dimensional structure for enamelin, which limits the parameters for prediction programs (Ramensky et al. 2002; Ng and Henikoff 2003; Brunham et al. 2005). The other nonsynonymous polymorphism G14970A results in a change from arginine to glutamine. While the change is not conservative, the amino acid change is predicted to have no functional consequence (Ramensky et al. 2002; Ng and Henikoff 2003; Brunham et al. 2005).\n\nVariation between primates:\n\nTo understand the evolutionary history of enamelin, we sequenced enamelin exons in 12 primates and analyzed nucleotide changes for evidence of positive selection. Primates were chosen on the basis of their taxonomic relationships and dietary preferences ( ). The phylogeny of these primates is well established (Purvis 1995; Boffelli et al. 2003). The dN/dS value for the data set, averaged over all sites, is 0.6799. We found that there are 18 nonsynonymous and 9 synonymous changes between human and chimpanzee. Averaging dN/dS across all sites is not a powerful method for detecting positive selection. While the average dN/dS for enamelin is high compared to other genes, we used more powerful methods to identify positive selection (see materials and methods). From the sites analysis, we conclude that enamelin has been subject to positive selection with 4% of the sites having dN/dS = 6.8 (P < 0.001) ( ).\n\nTABLE 2\n\nModels compared−2ΔlnLParameter estimates under selection modelPositively selected sitesNeutral (M1) vs. selection (M2)35.04**p1 = 0.96, ω1 = 0.5164, 68, 102, 110, 139, 146, 190, 257, 278, 337, 341, 354, 361, 426, 431, 525, 623, 644, 665, 672, 743, 846, 1056(d.f. = 2)p2 = 0, ω2 = 1.00p3 = 0.04, ω3 = 6.76One-ratio (M0) vs. discrete (M3)63.22**p1 = 0.33, ω1 = 0.5164, 68, 102, 110, 139, 146, 190, 257, 278, 337, 341, 354, 361, 426, 431, 525, 587, 623, 639, 640, 644, 665, 672, 743, 760, 846, 1056(d.f. = 4)p2 = 0.63, ω2 = 0.51p3 = 0.04, ω3 = 6.76β (M7) vs. β and ω (M8)35.06**p0 = 0.96, p = 99.0, q = 93.264, 68, 102, 110, 139, 146, 190, 257, 278, 337, 341, 354, 361, 426, 431, 525, 587, 623, 639, 640, 644, 665, 672, 743, 760, 846, 1056(d.f. = 2)(p1 = 0.044)ω = 6.80β and ω = 1 (M8a) vs. β and ω (M8)17.52**Same as aboveSame as above(d.f. = 1)One-ratio (M0) vs. free-ratio25.55NANAa(d.f. = 20)Branch site neutral vs. selection43.17**p0 = 0.395, ωbg = 0.030, ωfg = 0.030102, 257, 672, 1056(d.f. =1)p1 = 0.601 ωbg = 1.00, ωfg = 1.00p2a = 0.001, ωbg = 0.030, ωfg = 999p2b = 0.002, ωbg = 1.00, ωfg = 999\n\nThe locations of the amino acids under selection were predicted using a Bayes empirical Bayes approach (Yang et al. 2005) ( ). None of these sites correspond to the high-frequency nonsynonymous SNPs described above. The amino acids under selection are all located in the secreted protein; none are located in the 39-amino-acid signal sequence ( ). The 32-kDa cleavage product is the most prevalent form of enamelin in the tooth enamel matrix; the 32-kDa products accumulate throughout the enamel matrix with higher abundance than other cleavage products. Three of the amino acids under selection are located in this 32-kDa cleavage product. In general, the majority of the sites under selection are concentrated in the N-terminal half of the protein. There is a concentration of charged changes between amino acids 354 and 639; only two of the eight changes in the region do not alter charge. One of the sites (665) corresponds to the C-terminal cleavage site for the 89-kDa cleavage product (which is later cleaved into the 32-kDa product) and the 25-kDa product. The locations of the amino acids under selection indicate regions that are potentially important in enamelin function. Positive selection on enamelin amino acids may be a result of shifting dietary pressures, leading to enamel thickness differences among primates.\n\nAlthough primate diets are complex, diet categorization allows for phylogenetic and selection analyses. The primates used in our analysis can be divided into three major dietary groups: folivore, frugivore, and omnivore (see for classifications). Researchers using primate diet to understand species characteristics use similar classifications (Milton and May 1976; Richard 1985; Sussman 1987). The ancestral dietary states were inferred by parsimony (Swofford 2003). Two of the inferred diet shifts are from folivory to omnivory. The third change occurs on the lineage leading to New World monkeys, along which the diet changed from folivory to frugivory. Tooth enamel thickness and diet are correlated (Fleagle 1988; Schwartz 2000). Primate RNases and lysozymes have been shown to track with diet change at the molecular level (Messier and Stewart 1997; Zhang 2003, 2006). Messier and Stewart (1997) detected bursts of adaptive evolution corresponding to the evolution of foregut fermentation in colobine monkeys. Both lysozymes and RNases experienced episodes of adaptive evolution associated with diet specialization. Thus, we predicted that dietary shifts along the primate phylogeny might be correlated with bursts of adaptive evolution. Using the branch-site method in PAML, we tested the hypothesis that the three branches with inferred diet changes also experienced a burst of adaptive evolution. Branches with a diet shift will be referred to as foreground lineages. The null model, in which the foreground and background lineages have dN/dS between 0 and 1, was compared to the selection model that allows the foreground lineages to have dN/dS > 1 (see materials and methods). We concluded that positive selection acted on the branches, coinciding with changes in primate diet (−2ΔlnL = 44, d.f. = 1, P < 0.0001). The sites identified are a subset of those identified among primates in the sites model analysis. Our findings are consistent with previous studies documenting molecular change corresponding to dietary pressures."
