        "text": "At the heart of New York Life is a commitment to be there for our customers when they need us ­– whether today or decades into the future. We have delivered on that promise for over 175 years by investing wisely, growing a portfolio of strategic businesses, and remaining true to our mission as a mutual company, accountable only to our customers, not to outside investors. For our customers, that means having the confidence that comes with knowing they can build a better future for themselves and those they love.\n\nAt a time when our lives were turned upside down, working to create the Brave of Heart Fund provided us with a true sense of purpose. Knowing that we would be able to do what New York Life does best – provide financial security for people in their greatest time of need – gave us the motivation to allocate the funding, set up the verification team internally, engage our workforce and promote the Fund as widely as possible. That we were able to help more than 900 families is a testament to the humanity and efforts of our people and partners.\n\nIn times of tragedy and disaster, most people that are not directly impacted feel helpless. COVID-19 was no different. I was thankful that my company helped to create the Brave of Heart Fund because it not only made me proud of where I work, but it provided a way for me to help in a small way. I hope the funds demonstrate that we are grateful for the bravery of healthcare workers that died and help to alleviate some of the financial stress their families have endured.\n\nOur mission was to provide financial support to the individuals who lost a family member to COVID by risking their lives while helping others. We accomplished that goal but more importantly, in doing so we also honored the many healthcare workers who lost their lives to COVID by shining a light on their bravery. The fund’s success was thanks to the dedication and collaboration of the many individuals across the country in Service, our Foundation, and our partners at E4E and Cigna. I’m so proud to have been part of this effort.\n\nSupporting the Brave of Heart was one of the most rewarding and proudest moments in my career at New York Life. Our team demonstrated the New York Life values in a unique and personal way, allowing us to support families of healthcare workers during one of the most difficult periods in their lives. Healthcare workers put taking care of patients ahead of the concerns for their personal health. It was very humbling experience to be able to provide some financial assistance to the families they left behind.\n\nThis is such a sad time for so many, but it is nice to have been able to give them a little silver lining to help them get through such a touch time in their lives. These are the things that make me proud of what we do and what NYL stands for. So blessed to be part of this team and a part of giving back to those in need!\n\nBOHF has supported so many families during a challenging time, both financially and emotionally. My proudest moment as a BOHF project member was to read grantee comments and stories, the greatest testimony to how BOHF has positively impacted so many lives. It has been an honor to be able to support this program and to be a part of the noble cause.\n\nAt Cigna, we’re more than a health insurance company. We are your partner in total health and wellness. And we’re here for you 24/7 – caring for your body and mind. As a global health service company, Cigna’s mission is to improve the health, well-being, and peace of mind of those we serve by making health care simple, affordable, and predictable.\n\nAs we’ve seen in the past, trying times bring out the best in us, as individuals and communities. Our nation’s health care workers and volunteers embody this every day, as they answer the call of duty with bravery and selflessness. We are proud partners with New York Life and E4E in supporting the families of these American heroes who give so much while treating others. Through the Brave of Heart Fund, we seek to bring greater peace of mind to these families, by helping to relieve the emotional and financial burdens they will face in the aftermath of this health crisis.\n\nEvery doctor, nurse, pharmacist, and health care worker on the front line of this pandemic made and continues to make incredible sacrifices. Day in and day out, they care for their communities and put the health of others ahead of their own. For some, that meant sacrificing their own life in order to heal others. Unfortunately, the pandemic took so much from so many, and for those health care heroes who lost their own lives to COVID-19, we grieve with their families. We hope that through the financial support and emotional resources of The Brave of Heart Fund, those families who experienced loss have some peace of mind.\n\nE4E Relief provides charitable grants to help compassionate companies support employees in need. Global climate change and economic conditions worldwide have catastrophic disasters and financial hardships on the rise. Many companies are considering how they will respond when a disaster impacts the well-being of their employees, communities, and business. With nearly two decades of experience serving a broad range of clients, we deliver expert counsel and an objective, streamlined process for providing grant awards to employees during times of unanticipated hardship and disaster. We believe Employee Relief Funds are good for business because they assist employees in crisis, who return to work healthier and more productive.\n\nBeing a part of E4E Relief has given me the opportunity to really make an impact to those in need through the Brave of Heart Fund. At a time when the nation was going through so much uncertainty, our team was able to stand up in partnership with NYL and Cigna to provide some breathing room and financial relief to the families of healthcare workers that risked their lives for us day in and day out during the pandemic. I have seen first-hand how we can all come together regardless of our backgrounds to love and support one another.\n\nWhen we were establishing the Brave of Heart Fund with NYLife and Cigna, all of the people involved were quarantined at home, feeling helpless to aid in any way in the fight against this pandemic. It was in the early days, and no one knew the lasting impact that Covid would have on our lives, and on those of frontline healthcare workers. Although we were stuck at home, we had a strong desire to help those doing the real battle and risking their lives to help others. Brave of Heart allowed us to play a small part in helping healthcare workers and their families, at a critical time so early in the pandemic.\n\nI hold the voices and stories of the grantee families of these lost frontline healthcare workers as sacred. It felt like everything else in the world froze as I was taking in the grief, love and pride of these families who will remember the pandemic differently than any others in the world. In every conversation, it was evident that while they were grieving all we wish we could have known that may have protected their loved ones, they believe these people were doing what they loved. Their commitment to their work was as life giving as it was costly in the end. It was a great privilege to offer any relief to the families.\n\nIt wasn’t a singular moment, but over the last 2 years, the pandemic has hit every industry, every company, every community, and every family. Like so many other devastating events throughout history, something inherently good can come from something bad. The Brave of Heart Fund is one of those good things. It is an honor to be a part of the team who rallied to ensure these families, who lost their loved ones in service to others, had hope in the darkest of times.\n\nOnce I started working on the Brave of Heart Fund, the magnitude of the pandemic became real for me. Those lives that were lost became friends, and their families became my family. I grieved for their lost lives and the ones they left behind. And I will never forget them. The Brave of Heart Fund truly helped keep the spirit of the healthcare workers alive and reminded me, in such a scary time, of the good in humanity.\n\nAmid the over 900 families that the Brave of Heart Fund was able to assist, is one that is particularly special to me – the family of my high school friend, Miriam Ullman. We spent time at each other’s homes, and shared many laughs, tears, and fond memories. Mimi, as we affectionately called her, was fully vaccinated. But, due to other health conditions, she couldn’t fight off the virus and ultimately succumbed to COVID-19. After talking with her sister, I learned that Mimi had been a receptionist at a health care facility in New Jersey. The sadness of losing Mimi was made just a small bit brighter, knowing that the Brave of Heart Fund would be able to assist her family. Whenever I think of her, I will always be reminded of the hundreds of families we were able to help.\n\nI feel incredibly proud of the work E4E Relief was able to do through the Brave of Heart Fund. I am especially proud of the Voices of the Brave of Heart series that was produced to raise awareness. It is an honor to have had the opportunity to help tell the stories of the healthcare workers and their families who selflessly paid the ultimate price to save the lives of others. I’m glad to be part of an organization that stepped in to help shoulder some of the burdens for those families whose worst fears came true.\n\nIt’s been so impactful for me to work directly with affected families, and then help facilitate the ‘passing of the baton’ to other organizations to continue the good work. Several of our organizational grantees are hopeful that programming and resources to support families and healthcare workers will continue to be offered for years to come. While the Covid pandemic has been such an unthinkable tragedy, Brave of Heart has truly been a light in the dark."
