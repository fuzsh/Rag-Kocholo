        "text": "JOHN EDWARD BURKE\n\nBismarck, North Dakota\n\n\"Soc\"\n\nALL the essential qualities of real manhood are embodied in \"Soc.\" Combined with an irresistible spirit of good cheer, is a soul of deep understanding and a heart as big as a barrel. The hand of Destiny writes success for \"Soc,\" for no obstacles are too big for him to surmount. A fighting spirit is unconquerable.\n\nHis weakness is twofold; namely, women and exaggeration. His famous story dwells on the climatic changes in North Dakota. \"Say Smitty, in the year 1873, a terrible blizzard struck Bismarck on the Fourth of July, and all the farmers who were in town to celebrate the occasion were buried in forty feet of snow!\"\n\n\"Soc\" is an experienced judge of females, and quite a connoisseur on the subject, but I do believe he would be hurt if he ever made a favorable remark when judging the other's girl.\n\nLike most of us he has met many obstacles in his Academic path but \"that old time fight\" has pulled him through so far in Life and will probably continue to do so.\n\nAn athlete of no mean ability, he prefers to succumb to the radiator and its warming charms. \"Sic\" 'em \"Soc.\""
