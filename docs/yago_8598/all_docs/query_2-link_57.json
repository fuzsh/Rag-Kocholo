        "text": "\"Marriage is no love affair my dear.\"\n\nOn her first day at work Bobby (Anne Shirley) meets Rims (John Garfield) and the two fall for one another. But Rims has dreams of moving to the Philippines to work on an invention and the two will have to figure out what is more important, their relationship or his previous plans.\n\nThere's nothing boundary pushing or challenging about Saturday's Children.

I love ya, you crazy lug, you!\" ....ok, so those might not have been her exact words, but I'm not too far off.\n\nShe certainly wasn't shaken up about her father narrowly escaping the clutches of death, that's for sure."
