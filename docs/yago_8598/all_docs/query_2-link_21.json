        "text": "\"Why is Rachel always here? I want her to leave.\" Music Box Films has finally revealed the full US trailer for an acclaimed French film titled Other People's Children, which most recently stopped by the 2023 Sundance Film Festival a few months ago. It first premiered at the 2022 Venice Film Festival last fall, and also played at TIFF before opening in France last September. Rachel is a happy, 40-ish-year-old teacher who loves her life, her friends, her job, and even her exes. She is exploring the idea of having a child but is not desperate to have one. Intrigued, ambivalent about it at times — an authentic example of the conundrum many women around her age face. Everything changes when she meets a new man with a wonderful 4-year-old daughter. Virginie Efira stars as Rachel, along with Roschdy Zem, Chiara Mastroianni, Callie Ferreira-Goncalves, Yamée Couture, Henri-Noël Tabary, Victor Lefebvre, as well as Sébastien Pouderoux. It \"impressed audiences with its deeply moving and acutely observed portrait of one woman’s fluctuating feelings around maternal instincts and societal pressures.\" A truly lovely film, it's worth a watch.\n\nHere's the official US trailer (+ poster) for Rebecca Zlotowski's Other People's Children, from YouTube:"
