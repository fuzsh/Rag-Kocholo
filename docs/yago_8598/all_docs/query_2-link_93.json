        "text": "Treatment\n\nAppropriate first aid must be used to treat any burns or scalds as soon as possible. This will limit the amount of damage to your skin.\n\nYou can apply the following first aid techniques to yourself or another person who's been burnt.\n\nFirst aid for burns\n\nStop the burning process as soon as possible. This may mean removing the person from the area, dousing flames with water, or smothering flames with a blanket. Do not put yourself at risk of getting burnt as well.\n\nRemove any clothing or jewellery near the burnt area of skin, including babies' nappies. But do not try to remove anything that's stuck to the burnt skin, as this could cause more damage.\n\nCool the burn with cool or lukewarm running water for 20 minutes as soon as possible after the injury. Never use ice, iced water, or any creams or greasy substances like butter.\n\nKeep yourself or the person warm. Use a blanket or layers of clothing, but avoid putting them on the injured area. Keeping warm will prevent hypothermia, where a person's body temperature drops below 35C (95F). This is a risk if you're cooling a large burnt area, particularly in young children and elderly people.\n\nCover the burn with cling film. Lay the cling film over the burn, rather than wrapping it around a limb. A clean, clear plastic bag can be used for burns on your hand.\n\nTreat the pain from a burn with paracetamol or ibuprofen. Always check the manufacturer's instructions when using over-the-counter medication. Children under 16 years of age should not be given aspirin.\n\nRaise the affected area, if possible. This will help to reduce swelling.\n\nWhen to go to hospital\n\nOnce you have taken these steps, you'll need to decide whether further medical treatment is necessary.\n\nGo to a hospital accident and emergency (A&E) department for:\n\nlarge burns bigger than the size of the affected person's hand\n\ndeep burns of any size that cause white or charred skin\n\nburns on the face, neck, hands, feet, any joints, or genitals\n\nall chemical and electrical burns\n\nany other injuries that need treating\n\nany signs of shock – symptoms include cold, clammy skin, sweating, rapid, shallow breathing, and weakness or dizziness\n\nYou should also go to hospital if you or the person who has been burned:\n\nis under the age of 10\n\nhas a medical condition, such as heart, lung or liver disease, or diabetes\n\nhas a weakened immune system (the body's defence system) – for example, because of HIV or AIDS, or because they're having chemotherapy for cancer\n\nIf someone has breathed in smoke or fumes, they should also get medical attention at hospital.\n\nSome symptoms may be delayed, and can include:\n\ncoughing\n\na sore throat\n\ndifficulty breathing\n\nsinged nasal hair\n\nfacial burns\n\nYou should also go to A&E if you have been injured intentionally, or think someone has been injured intentionally.\n\nSee recovering from burns and scalds for information on how serious burns are treated.\n\nElectrical burns\n\nElectrical burns may not look serious, but they can be very damaging. Someone who has an electrical burn should seek immediate medical attention at an A&E department.\n\nIf the person has been injured by a low-voltage source (up to 220 to 240 volts), such as a domestic electricity supply, safely switch off the power supply or remove the person from the electrical source using a material that doesn't conduct electricity, such as a wooden stick or a wooden chair.\n\nDo not approach a person who's connected to a high-voltage source (1,000 volts or more).\n\nAcid and chemical burns\n\nAcid and chemical burns can be very damaging and require immediate medical attention at an A&E department.\n\nIf possible, find out what chemical caused the burn and tell the healthcare professionals at A&E.\n\nIf you're helping someone else, put on appropriate protective clothing, such as gloves, and then:\n\nremove any contaminated clothing on the person\n\nif the chemical is dry, brush it off their skin\n\nuse running water to remove any traces of the chemical from the burnt area\n\nSunburn\n\nFollow this advice for sunburn:\n\nIf you notice any signs of sunburn, such as hot, red and painful skin, move into the shade or preferably inside.\n\nTake a cool bath or shower for 10 minutes to cool down the burnt area of skin.\n\nApply aftersun lotion to the affected area to moisturise, cool and soothe it. Don't use greasy or oily products.\n\nIf you have any pain, paracetamol or ibuprofen should help relieve it. Always read the manufacturer's instructions and do not give aspirin to children under the age of 16.\n\nStay hydrated by drinking plenty of water.\n\nWatch out for signs of heat exhaustion or heatstroke, where the temperature inside your body rises to 37 to 40C (98.6 to 104F) or above. Symptoms include dizziness, a rapid pulse or vomiting.\n\nIf a person with heat exhaustion is taken to a cool place quickly, given water to drink and has their clothing loosened, they should start to feel better within half an hour.\n\nIf they don't, they could develop heatstroke. This is a medical emergency and you'll need to call 999 for an ambulance.\n\nRead more about what to do if someone has heat exhaustion or heatstroke."
