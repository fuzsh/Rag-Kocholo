        "text": "Golden silence reigns in the Capitol during the screening of Greta Garbo's latest film, \"The Kiss,\" the direction of which has been accomplished with consummate artistry by Jacques Feyder, the Frenchman who was responsible for those noteworthy contributions, \"Faces of Children,\" \"Thérèse Raquin\" and Raquel Meller's \"Carmen.\" This present offering is the first M. Feyder has made in Hollywood and his work in it indicates that he can do quite as well in California as he did in Europe.It is the direction and the finished acting of Miss Garbo and others that recommend this feature rather than the story, which is no tour de force. The incidents are invariably engrossing and Miss Garbo was never more alluring than she is as Mme. Irene Guarry, the wife of a wealthy silk merchant of Lyons. She first appears in a modish hat, one of those creations that seem to have been inspired by fliers' headgears. Not a curl or even a strand of hair protrudes under the hard line around her face. She may not look pretty, but she is fascinating, and as the scenes pass along. Miss Garbo becomes increasingly attractive, especially in the closing glimpses, where she is arrayed in black. There are times when she permits her jealously guarded hair to be seen—when she is without a hat, but that is within her home.Throughout this production Miss Garbo once again reveals her extraordinary talent for screen acting, and under M. Feyder's guidance she is if anything more impressive than she has been in other films. There is a restraint in this picture and the scenes are charmingly lighted. They glide along instead of jumping.There is a murder in this pictorial yarn. The crime is committed by Mme. Guarry and the victim is her husband. There is therefore a trial in a French court, which is depicted with marked cleverness and a sense of authentic atmosphere. It strikes one as being vastly more real than other motion picture trials, and during a recess of the court there is a decidedly human glimpse. It is when three scrubwomen are perceived eating their luncheon, seated in the great bench chairs, which only a minute or so before had been occupied by the learned judges.The trial ends in the jury acquitting Irene Guarry, the twelve good men and true believing that M. Guarry committed suicide. He didn't. Irene shot him to save a young man, named Pierre, from injury at the hands of her raging husband, who imagines that Pierre, the son of his business associate, is the youth with whom his wife is in love. Pierre loves Irene. There is never any doubt about that. But Irene is enamored of André, an attorney impersonated by Conrad Nagel. It is André who persuades the jury to look upon M. Guarry's death as self-inflicted. Pierre knowing that Irene had killed her husband, believes that she did it because she loved him.There are several splendid panoramic effects in the course of this story. Each sequence is handled in such a masterful manner that the result is beguiling. The persons, from the hard and suspicious husband to the three merry charwomen, have something real about them.Mr. Nagel acquits himself with distinction. Anders Randolf does some capital acting as the unfortunate husband. Holmes Herbert gives an easy performance as Guarry's partner. Lew Ayres and George Davis also serve the picture well.Harry Rose amused the audience yesterday afternoon during the stage proceedings and further laughter was aroused by the comic antics of Laurel and Hardy in a boisterous affair known as \"They Go Boom.\"\n\nA Silent Miss Garbo.THE KISS, with Greta Garbo, Conrad Nagel, Anders Randolf, Holmes Herbert, Lew Ayres and George Davis, written by George M. Saville, directed by Jacques Feyder; \"They Go Boom,\" a Laurel and Hardy comedy; \"Mysterioso,\" devised and staged by Harry A. Gourfain, with Harry Rose, Llora Hoffman, Gordon and King, the Chester Hale dancers and others. At the Capitol Theatre.In an audible picture that, despite poor dialogue and none too imaginative direction, arouses considerable curiosity through its ingeniously conceived incidents, Paul Muni, who was last seen on the screen in the talking version of \"The Valiant,\" gives a sympathetic and competent characterization as Papa Chibou, the watchman in a Paris wax works show. Mr. Muni also impersonates in the course of a dream sequence six of the lay figures under his charge who are supposed to come to life and give him advice concerning love and women. These momentary flashes of Franz Schubert; Willic Smith, a costermonger; Don Juan; Diablero, a hypnotist, and Napoleon, are not nearly so interesting, however, as the interpretation of Papa Chibou.It is a film which might easily have been far more worthy. The director and the adapters have failed to maintain the whimsical nature of the story and therefore it often drags.The reproduction of the voices yesterday afternoon was a great deal too loud, possibly because the projection booth operators had not had sufficient time to study the varying tonal quality of the scenes.Here and there, Berthold Viertel, the director, introduces some effective bits, but more often than not he gives too much footage to scenes that are only appealing up to a certain point. Marguerite Churchill, who impersonates a romantic girl, is careless in her diction and also her acting, and the lines allotted to her are often too trite to suit this narrative.Nevertheless the good idea of the story still persists and at the close there is a pleasing dénouement. Papa Chibou, a gentle old soul, sympathizes with Georges Dufeyel, a young lawyer, and Helene Berthelot, whose romance is not what Judge Berthelot (Helene's father) expects. Georges and Helene, acting on the suggestion of Papa Chibou, carry on a correspondence with each other by putting notes into Napoleon's pocket. Then there is a misunderstanding and Georges thinks that Helene is partial to a young dandy whose intellect is the least of his assets.Papa Chibou, through the years he has spent among the wax figures, looks upon some of them as if they possessed souls, particularly Napoleon. Hence, when the figures are to be sold at auction. Papa Chibou counts up his savings and bids for Napoleon, who is in a lot with the wax head of a murderer and a pelican that makes a rasping noise. Not being able to bid as high as another man. Papa Chibou decides to steal Napoleon, and so one perceives the doddering old chap carrying the wax figure through the Paris streets until he is finally arrested by the police.One of the most interesting developments in this yarn occurs at Papa Chibou's trial, at which Helene's father presides. Chibou is defended by Georges, who in the course of his summing up tells how Papa Chibou had been impressed by the stories of Napoleon's conquests and his retreat from Moscow.Chibou, after a conference between the judge and others, is found guilty. The judge, however, not only decides to suspend sentence but also contributes the necessary amount to buy the wax figure of Napoleon, which is given to Papa Chibou, who then surprises everybody by saying that he never knew that Napoleon was the remarkable man described by Georges. He feels in Napoleon's pockets and discovers a note, which results in Georges and Helene patching up their quarrel.The principal stage contribution is \"Versailles,\" a colorful offering, with appealing music, singing and dancing.\n\nSEVEN PAGES, with Paul Muni, Marguerite Churchill, Lester Lonergan, Russell Gleason, Gustav von Seyffertitz, Eugene Besserer, Walter Rogers and Salka Stensrmann, based on Richard Connell's story, \"A Friend of Napoleon,\" directed by Berthold Viertel; overture, \"Mignon;\" \"Versailles,\" with Beatruce Belkin, David Drollet, Leonide Massine, Patricia Bowman and others; \"A Napoleonic Episode.
