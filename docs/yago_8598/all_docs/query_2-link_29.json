        "text": "Story\n\nSet in rural England and Inspired by real life events. The Silent Child film centres around a profoundly deaf four year old girl named Libby who is born into a middle class family and lives in a world of silence until a caring social worker teaches her the gift of communication.\n\nWhen fresh faced social worker, Joanne turns up we see Libby transform. This once withdrawn four year old suddenly feels connected to the world and over a short period of time Joanne and Libby's relationship blossoms.\n\nAn insightful short story, inspired by real life events, observing one of the loneliest disabilities and the avoidable struggles that deaf children face.\n\nA Note From\n\nThe Writer\n\nMy brilliant father lost his hearing very suddenly when I was 12 years old and lived the last 2 years of his life profoundly deaf. I witnessed first hand the huge effects deafness has on a family. Simple things we took for granted like phoning him to see what time he’s home, eating out, a knock on the door and shouting from the next room among other things suddenly became difficult, some even impossible. I also witnessed my super hero dad for the first time seem vulnerable and I noticed how easy it was for people to leave him out.\n\n90% of deaf children are born to hearing parents with no experience of deafness often resulting in limited communication between the parent and child, meaning a child can start school with little to no communication skills. Since the closure of almost all deaf schools, deaf children now have to attend mainstream school and shockingly over 78% of deaf children attend mainstream school with no specialised support in place. This is heavily reflected in their grades as well as their mental health and well being.\n\nDeafness is a silent disability, you can’t see it and it’s not life threatening so it’s easy for it to slip under your radar. We hope this movie helps to get sign language recognised in schools and give a voice to all the silent children around the world."
