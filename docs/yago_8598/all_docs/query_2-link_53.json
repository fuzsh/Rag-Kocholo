        "text": "Director Kurt Wimmer’s new take on Stephen King’s horror story Children of the Corn has been acquired for release by RLJE Films and Shudder, with the companies recently announcing that the film will first hit theaters on March 3 for an 18-day theatrical run.\n\nKing’s story and the franchise it birthed followed murderous children who worshipped the mysterious entity “He Who Walks Behind the Rows.” Yesterday’s red band trailer confirmed a new batch of lethal cult kids, but what of their corn god?\n\nNot only does the trailer end with an inhuman growl, teasing the presence of “He Who Walks,” but Bloody Disgusting can exclusively confirm that the new Children of the Corn movie will reveal a new interpretation of the evil lurking in the Nebraska cornfields.\n\nWhat the entity looks like remains a mystery until the film’s release. However, it’s safe to assume that Wimmer and team will take a vastly different approach than Screaming Mad George’s monstrous version seen in Children of the Corn III: Urban Harvest.\n\nAs Wikipedia explains, the entity known as “He Who Walks Behind the Rows” is “a demonic spirit posing as a twisted fertility deity, who corrupted the children of the remote town of Gatlin into a murderous cult bent on sacrificing every adult around.”\n\nIn Wimmer’s movie, which is said to have very little to do with King’s novel, “Possessed by a spirit in a dying cornfield, a twelve-year-old girl in Nebraska recruits the other children in her small town to go on a bloody rampage and kill all the adults and anyone else who opposes her. A bright high schooler who won’t go along with the plan is the town’s only hope of survival.”\n\nThe new film’s cast includes Elena Kampouris (Before I Fall), Kate Moyer (“When Hope Calls”), Callan Mulvey (Avengers: Endgame), and Bruce Spence (The Road Warrior).\n\nFor those who don’t recognize his name, Kurt Wimmer is the director of films including the Christian Bale-starring Equilibrium and the Milla Jovovich-starring Ultraviolet. Children of the Corn is his first movie since 2006, though he did more recently write films including Law Abiding Citizen, Salt, Total Recall, and Point Break, as well as the 2020 horror movie Spell.\n\nThe new movie is the eleventh overall installment in the franchise."
