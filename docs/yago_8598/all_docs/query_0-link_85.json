        "text": "A child playing on his own, elects an object (a doll for example) which is going to act as a partner, or as a medium for his imagination, facilitating the evasion to a fantasised world. Likewise, an ordinary object becomes a magical object when it is taken away from its primary function.\n\nThe doll, a transitionnal object\n\nWithin the space of the film, just like in a sacred space, the play area owned by the characters is ruled by proper laws. Limited by a visible or imaginary frontier, whether limited by a simple circle traced on the floor or expanded to the scale of a neighbourhood during a hide-and-seek game, this space becomes island, within which only the players who know the rules can gather.\n\nIn the cinema, we rediscover the different playing categories existing in life: competition, luck, mock, playing with vertigo… Each of them raises specific question for the film maker with regards to directing, leading to making a choice of system to capture the emotions and the feelings felt by the player, and putting the actors’ bodies into play.\n\nShared play, diversion of places dedicated to work, gloating social disruption but also psychotic break: the players, whatever their age, play with the clear frontier existing in the everyday world between children’s world and adults’ world.\n\nWhen the circumstances deprive a child from playing, this experience, that usually culturally builds up an individual, becomes impossible: childhood is stolen, playing becomes tragic. Even though the player’s gestures remain, the sense, the promises from playing are wiped out by the heaviness of an unbreachable seriousness."
