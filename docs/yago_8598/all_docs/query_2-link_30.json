        "text": "The young director Lucia Lupu has started a new film project – a short fiction film called “Parents and Children,” a minimalist story that encompasses sensitive local and universal themes. The film will spotlight the deep yearning for roots and authentic living while confronting the inevitable loss of these roots in the face of an increasingly globalized and technologized world.\n\n“Parents and Children,” tells the story of a mother and daughter on the verge of university, who return to their home village to organize a memorial mass for their recently died grandmother. During the preparations, the two share their innermost thoughts about their relationship and their fear of losing each other. It takes place in a symbolic setting, in the parents’ home, which is desolate and filled with history and unrequited emotions.\n\n“As you know, making a film in Moldova is a significant challenge. Many of my colleagues exhaust their last resources to pursue the ambitious and costly dream of filmmaking. It’s important to recognize that developing a unique cinematic language and telling a story that truly resonates with audiences requires consistent practice. However, in Moldova, this kind of practice is a rare luxury that can afford.\n\nI believe in the power of the community and a future of quality films in Moldova, with participation in festivals and premieres with full houses. I believe in a functioning local industry and a Film Fund, which will facilitate access to resources for film! Until then, I’m counting on you, dear viewers!” says Lucia Lupu.\n\nLucia and her team need your support to realize this project. Those willing to donate to the movie “Parents and Children” can do it by clicking here.\n\nEvery contribution counts: it will provide a meal for a team member, cover production costs, or supplement the salary of those involved in the movie. Also, if you own a business or are in the film industry, you can become a partner in this wonderful project.\n\nFilming will take place between September and October 2024. Let’s be part of the “Parents and Children” story and support the Lucia Lupu talent! Donations and campaign shares will make a difference.\n\nThe short film “Paparuda,” directed by Lucia Lupu, participated in several international festivals and won 3 awards. The local audience greatly appreciated the movie, packing the screening hall on the opening day.\n\nVia Daca’s music video “Paparuda,” based on the short film of the same name, has passed 5.5 million views on YouTube."
