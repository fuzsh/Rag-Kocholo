        "text": "Jean-Eric de Cockborne\n\nJean-Eric de Cockborne\n\nA Cinema History\n\nPublished Aug 10, 2017\n\nSee below my subjective selection. To read my reviews and watch the films (or excerpts for those not in the public domain), click here.\n\nБронено́сец Потёмкин [Battleship Potemkin] by Сергей Михайлович Эйзенштейн [Sergei Mikhailovich Eisenstein]. The masterpiece of Soviet Montage. An evocation of the historical mutiny on the battleship Potemkine, commissioned to celebrate the 20th anniversary of the Russian 1905 Revolution.\n\nDie freudlose Gasse [The Joyless Street] by Georg Wilhelm Pabst. The first film representative of the Neue Sachlichkeit [New Objectivity] movement. Hunger, crime, prostitution and speculation in Vienna in the years following World War One.\n\nVisages d'enfants [Faces of Children] by Jacques Feyder. A universal story of a boy torn between the love for his dead mother and his relation with his father and new stepmother, filmed on location in the mountains of the Swiss Valais.\n\nThe Gold Rush by Charles Chaplin. This first feature-length film where Charles Chaplin is staring as his well-known character The Tramp, marks his evolution from pure slapstick to a more structured narrative. It shows a successful prospector in Alaska during the Klondike Gold Rush at the end of the 19th century.\n\nDu skal ære din hustru [Master of the house] by Carl Theodor Dreyer. A Danish Kamerspiel [Chamber Drama] with a touch of humour. A domestic tyrant mishandles his wife to such an extent that she must leave the house. His old nanny moves in to take care of him and the three children. Under her strict discipline, he soon starts missing his wife.\n\nThe Big Parade by King Vidor. Between historic reconstitution and slapstick, one of the most successful American silent films. The son of a rich businessman enlists in the US army during WWI, becomes friend with two working class soldiers and falls in love with a French girl.\n\nLady Windermere's fan by Ernst Lubitsch. This adaptation of Oscar Wilde's eponymous comedy-drama, more serious in tone than Lubitsch's well-known comedies, is the third film that he realised in America. A good example of a successful adaptation of a play to the silver screen.\n\nLe double amour [Double Love] by Jean Epstein. While several constraints were imposed on Epstein by the production company Film Albatros, notably the melodramatic subject, he managed to realise a very personal film where he demonstrates his mastery in actors direction, in addition to his technical virtuosity already evidenced in earlier films.\n\nHerr Tartüff [Tartuffe] by F. W. Murnau. Probably the first use of film in film in cinema, where the hero screens a film loosely based on Molière's eponymous play, at his grandfather's house to make him understand how he is being exploited by his housekeeper.\n\n雄呂血 [Orochi/Serpent] by Buntarō Futagawa. A key film in Japanese cinema history, showing the transition between early Japanese Samurai films, strongly influenced by the Kabuki tradition with heavy make-up, exaggerated facial expressions and stilted poses, and chambara (sword fighting) films that would develop after World War II.\n\nAlso worth watching:\n\nLa fille de l'eau [Whirlpool of fate]. The first film directed by Jean Renoir, where he explores different genres and techniques he will develop in later works.\n\nЗакройщик из Торжка [Zakroyshchik iz Torzhka/The Tailor from Torzhok]. A comedy by Yakov Protazanov, showing without propaganda the changing society of the nascent Soviet Union.\n\nThe Pleasure Garden. The first film directed by Alfred Hitchcock, a thriller with fast action leading from London to Africa.\n\nParis qui dort [Paris asleep]. The first film directed by René Clair. A light comedy where he plays with time, entirely shot on location with many original views of Paris at the time."
