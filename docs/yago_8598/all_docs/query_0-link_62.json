        "text": "JOHNNY FRENCHMAN is a 1945 Ealing comedy-drama (dramedy? dromedary?) made to promote Anglo-French cooperation. 1945 might seem a bit late in the war for this to be needed, but films take time. Also, A MATTER OF LIFE AND DEATH was made to promote Anglo-American cooperation and didn’t really come out until the war was ended. Michael Powell was told his film was needed, because “While we were losing we were all getting on OK. But now that we’re winning all the old resentments are coming out.”\n\nEaling is the studio of microcosm so they postulate two fishing villages, one Cornish and one Breton, where there’s rivalry and enmity — the French are always poaching the Brits’ crabs and so on. Tom Walls plays a harbour master and the great Francoise Rosay, who’d escaped from occupied France via North Africa and hitched a ride on a bomber, is an innkeeper and fisherwoman. Complicating matters, Walls’ daughter Patricia Roc falls for Rosay’s son Paul Dupuis (imported from the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation). Even the advent of war doesn’t totally clear things up between these folks, but eventually, of course, group unity, the prevailing Ealing virtue, prevails.\n\nWritten by T.E.B. (“Tibby”) Clarke (THE LAVENDER HILL MOB) and directed by Charles Frend (THE CRUEL SEA) this is very engaging, if not reaching the modest greatness of post-war Ealing. Walls is much better in character roles — he gives good performances in leading man parts, but he’s not an acceptable leading man. Vanity seems to have driven him to play dashing lovers well past the age he could pull it off. Inescapably fat and rumpled here, he’s settled into the mode than now suits him best — alas, he’d die four years later, a great loss to British movies.\n\n(I encountered Walls as part of my research into Awful British Comedians, but I’ve yet to report properly on him. He is DNA: Definitely Not Awful.)\n\nWalls essays what seems a creditable Cornish accent — maybe it’s not accurate, I can’t tell, but it’s consistent and sounds the part. Patricia Roc as his daughter can’t be bothered with any of that, nor can Ralph Michael as the local boy who’s wooing her. So the young folks let the side down a little. They’re less interesting than the senior characters, too, even though they ought to have all that Romeo & Juliet stuff going for them. I get the feeling working-class or regional accents were considered undesirable in romantic leads in the UK, with a few exceptions.\n\nOne of the developments at postwar Ealing is the rejection of romantic leads almost totally in their best films. Sir Michael Balcon was uncomfortable with any treatment of sex, and though the forbidden nature of the romance here provides the occasional mild thrill, it’s the sparring between Walls and Rosay that carries the interest.\n\nRosay is of course magnifique — wrestling with the English language seems to even improve her, since the right kind of obstructions often bring out the best in people.\n\nVery nice location work, and the art department have done a great job transforming one Cornish village into a Breton one. There’s an egregious backdrop that’s used a little too obviously, but it hardly matters. Robert Sellers’ The Secret Life of Ealing Studios offers some amusing stories about the shoot: when Clarke was researching pilchards, one old fisherman told him, “Don’t know, m’dear. But ‘ee out in m’boat and show ‘ee a handsome bit ‘o coast for your back projection.”\n\nReleased the same year as DEAD OF NIGHT, this film doesn’t come close in terms of interest, settling for lightly likeable all down the line. A couple of people worked on both: Clarke did a dialogue polish on DON, while Ralph Michael is much more interesting in Robert Hamer’s haunted mirror story.\n\nIt’s a war picture where there’s no combat except a wrestling match, nobody dies, and there’s barely any life-or-death jeopardy except when a mine gets loose and floats into the harbour (Rosay to the rescue). This good old British restraint is interesting, and clearly deliberate. The film is very relaxing, which must have been the attempt — fresh air and mild peril as a relief from wartime tension.\n\nRoc pool.\n\nJOHNNY FRENCHMAN stars Laura Chapdelaine; Major Bone; Dilys; Peter Cortland; Duke of Burgundy; Kommandant Bernsdorff (The U-Boat Crew); Sister Bryony; and Shagal the Inn-Keeper.\n\nThanks to Shona Thomson of the Hippodrome Festival of Silent Cinema, I got to write the programme notes for their closing film, VISAGES DE L’ENFANTS (FACES OF CHILDREN) by Jacques Feyder. If this seems like a bold choice for a closing gala, that’s because the festival has been gaining confidence each year, building on the trust it has established with its audience — the crowds turn up for things they might never have heard of, confident that if it’s been scheduled, it must be worthwhile.\n\nHere’s what I wrote ~\n\nOne pleasure of silent cinema can be submerging in an antique world of strange mannerisms, alien artifice and antique craft. That’s not to be underrated. But discovering an apparently ancient film that speaks clearly across the decades in completely modern tones is another, more startling pleasure.\n\nHaving learned his craft in the teens on scores of smaller pictures, Jacques Feyder graduated to epics, sophisticated dramas, swooning romances, and helped train the next generation of directors, several of whom worked as his assistants. During short spells in Hollywood he directed Garbo twice, making her first talkie, Anna Christie, and worked with Marlene Dietrich in the British production Knight Without Armour. A versatile chap, he was equally at home with exotic romances and gritty, down-to-earth dramas. What unites his work is the sheer photographic beauty he imparts to it, regardless of subject.\n\nIn the twenties, Feyder was at the pinnacle of the French industry. In 1923 he directed Crainquebille, a slice of working-class realism, and discovered a child actor of amazing intensity and maturity, Jean Forest. Realizing he had caught lightning in a bottle, Feyder immediately cast young Forest in another picture, Faces of Children, which he co-wrote with his wife, the great actress Francoise Rosay.\n\nIn a tiny, elevated Alpine town, a boy has lost his mother. Feyder films the funeral procession as a series of electrified details, onlookers and the slow advance of the coffin and the boy’s shell-shocked expression. At the cemetery, under a jutting, almost expressionist crucifix, the lad collapses in a paroxysm of angst. Feyder, editing his own film as was the custom, frenziedly cross-cuts a burst of subliminal images to suggest Jean’s overloaded emotions.\n\nThroughout this extraordinary film, Feyder alternates sweeping vistas of Swiss scenery, in which figures can loom over valleys like gods, or vanish into landscapes where the skyline towers to the very top of the frame; and in a single breath he can take us into the mind of a character through a captured expression, a tightly focussed viewpoint, or a striking subjective effect. He had absorbed the innovations of the impressionist filmmakers who aspired to capture internal states using the cinema. This was the time when theorist-filmmakers like Louis Delluc, Germaine Dulac and Jean and Marie Epstein were pioneering techniques which evoked the sensations of delirium, giddiness, inebriation and dream. Feyder, meanwhile, had his other eye on the spectacle afforded by the natural world and by the possibilities of his troupe of actors.\n\nJean Forest, with his watchful expression and dramatic, strikingly adult postures, is a true prodigy, a child of twelve with both a flair for the dramatic—he can fling himself into attitudes of angst with the bravura of Lon Chaney—but also with an inherent truthfulness and a believable solemnity. He’s joined by two equally impressive youngsters; little Pierette Houyez plays his sister, too young to register their mother’s death, and Arlette Peyran is the new stepsister, upon whom all of Jean’s anxieties and resentment fall. Of the three, you may find Houyez the most appealing of all, since she never seems to be acting at, just behaving. She’s certainly not acting when her stepmother aggressively scrubs her dirty face. Feyder could be a little ruthless with his stars, I fear.\n\nKino’s Feyder box set is well worth buying, but I regret the faux-twenties English intertitles they’ve spliced in.\n\nWhat’s most impressive about this scenario is that it produces intense drama without a villain: Jean’s new stepmother is a well-meaning woman, his father is aware of his son’s sensitivity (spoken of as a condition it is hoped he’ll grow out of) and tries his best to allow for it, and Arlette is just a kid, no more selfish or wilful than Jean. The trauma of bereavement throws life off kilter and the result could end in tragedy. It’s both agonizingly tense and all too credible. Exhilarating experimentation, quietly powerful performances, a touching story, and a setting that takes the breath away.\n\nRediscover Jacques Feyder French Film Master: Queen of Atlantis/Crainquebille/Faces of Children\n\nI wish I’d recorded Julien Duvivier’s LYDIA on a previous occasion when I had the chance — it played on the late-lamented Carlton Cinema cable channel quite a bit, I think. Instead I downloaded it and got a pretty good copy, good enough to show what a handsome, plush film it is, but with a curiously distorted soundtrack.\n\nBasically, all the music and sound effects were way too loud. Miklos Rosza’s beautiful score, which there is a lot of (I love Miklos but he could overdo it slightly) swamped the dialogue. The FX track wasn’t able to completely smother speech, but it did become very strange when every footstep or rustle of clothing popped out at high volume, announcing how artificial it was. I couldn’t work out HOW such a version of the film had come to exist — it seems like somebody must have access to the original unmixed tracks and put them together in this peculiar way on purpose.\n\nThere was another problem — the ending. A weird jump dissolve in the middle of a shot, and then a VERY abrupt transition to the end credits a few seconds later, in which the background score gets chopped off before it can fade. Apart from it’s technical sloppiness, the conclusion seemed dramatically wrong too — we were clearly very close to an ending, but it hadn’t quite come along. “That CAN’T be the ending!” protested Fiona. But it was all the ending we were going to get. It reminded me of the stories about the truncated version of KISS ME DEADLY, which I’ve never seen, where a damaged print resulted in an ending where the house blew up prematurely and we never even knew if the supposed hero escaped with his life. And for years that was the only version in circulation, resulting in critics heaping praise upon Robert Aldrich’s courage in ending the film so harshly.\n\nI’d love to know how this version of LYDIA came to exist, but not as much as I’d love to see an intact one. Duvivier certainly suffered from studio-imposed truncations in Hollywood — episodes of TALES OF MANHATTAN and FLESH AND FANTASY were lopped out. The W.C. Fields section of TOM has since been restored, and while it’s easy to see why Fields’ desperate physical condition appalled the studio suits, it’s a bit harder to see why his only-slightly-less-desperate p.c. in previous films apparently didn’t bother anyone. The deleted chunk of FAF got padded out to make a whole new feature, DESTINY, with such weird results that I really must write about it. But back to LYDIA.\n\nThe film is billed as a remake of Duvivier’s French classic CARNET DU BAL, in which a widow, Francoise Rosay, rediscovers the old dance card from her first ball, and goes in search of the men she danced with, to see how differently her life might have turned out. It’s a lovely idea, leading to an episodic structure in which the cream of 30s French acting strut their stuff in a series of brief scenarios — the weakness of which rather let the film down.\n\nLYDIA borrows only one idea from its predecessor — the first ball is seen in flashback through Lydia’s eyes, as a glorious production number, and then revisited as it really was, a much smaller, almost tawdry affair. But while CARNET brackets the film with the two versions of the ball, LYDIA boldly disposes of the idea a couple of scenes in. When Joseph Cotten, fresh from CITIZEN KANE and in old age makeup again, invites his former competitors for Lydia’s hand to meet her once again, after she’s been honoured for her charity work (blind and crippled orphans), Lydia (Merle Oberon under an inch of Westmore latex) reminisces about the wonderful ball, filmed in slow motion —\n\n— and Cotten gently corrects her. All these transitions, by the way, are done by direct cutting, about twenty years before the nouvelle vague popularised it. Since apparently Cotten was cast because Orson Welles, a Duvivier fan, recommended him, possibly the unusual straight cuts across decades are influenced by similar moments in CITIZEN KANE. Duvivier does occasionally shoot from floor level, too.\n\nBy getting the misremembered ball out of the way, treating it almost as an incidental gag, Duvivier is now able to use the idea of faulty perception as a motif. Lydia’s first beau is a sportsman who impresses her with his eloquence — except he’s a big dope and his poetic soul is all her own projection. When he gets drunk and tries to be over-friendly, she misinterprets his clumsy affection for a rape attempt. Lydia’s blind pianist suitor composes a piece based around her face, as it was described to him by a child — but the description was faulty, so he has the hair and eye colour wrong. With a dashing sailor, Lydia sees undying love where there’s only the whim of the moment.\n\nAs if all this incident weren’t enough, there’s historical incident (the invasion of Cuba), music hall entertainment, imaginary landscapes —\n\n— and Edna May Oliver, in her final role, as Lydia’s domineering but sweet grandmother. With her booming voice and rangy form, EMO is an impressive presence, and that face! A sort of elongated hippopotamus seems to have been worked into it somewhere.\n\nHard to assess how good or great the film is with this flawed copy, but the visuals are superb. Lee Garmes photographed it, and Vincent Korda designed it, and it’s frequently breathtaking. Big studio gloss, but executed with intelligence and taste. Merle Oberon has never been so good, and so animated — she seems to feed off EMO’s considerable energy, and they make a brilliant and unlikely screen pairing. One shot where EMO lopes across her lobby and the much smaller Oberon trots along behind her had a beautiful comic choreography to it. Oberon also manages the transition from stroppy teen to elderly lady, with several stages in between. Then there’s Cotten, as likeable as ever, who’s given one of the film’s most quietly devastating moments, when Oberon pays him what she thinks is a complement:\n\nTo his father, the butler, Cotten observes, “I’ve just been told I’m a gentleman.”\n\nDad: “So you are, my son.”\n\nCotten looks grim. “A gentleman is never told he’s a gentleman.”\n\nAlso — if you can get a copy right away, do so: it’s very Christmassy."
