        "text": "When your name is changed in the Bible, it indicates that there has been a change of status. The person has not only been given a new name by God, their core-identity has changed too. We see it throughout the Scriptures…\n\nAbram’s name was changed to Abraham.\n\nHis wife Sarai was changed to Sarah.\n\nJacob, the grandson of Abraham, was given the name Israel.\n\nSimon was renamed Peter by Jesus.\n\nAnd then famously, Saul saw Jesus on the road and became Paul.\n\nWe also are given a new “core-identity”, but it is an identity that was designed for us by God before we were born and is written down in heaven. Jesus told his disciples that this was more important than casting our demons! He said,\n\n…do not rejoice that the spirits submit to you, but rejoice that your names are written in heaven. -Luke 10:20\n\nCharles Austin Miles originally wrote a song with the title A New Name Written Down in Glory back in 1910. He had already aban­don­ed his ca­reer as a phar­ma­cist and had become a gospel song writer. Our new song by People&Songs is loosely based on Miles’ song. In fact, there is only one line that carries over…\n\nThere’s a new name written down in glory,\n\nAnd it’s mine, O yes, it’s mine!\n\nBUT there is an important difference. Miles’ song suggested that your name was written down in glory at the time of your salvation. But Revelation tells us something different. It says,\n\nThe inhabitants of the earth whose names have not been written in the book of life from the creation of the world will be astonished… -Revelation 17:8\n\nSo before “the creation of the world”, your name was already written in the book of life. But let’s jump in and see how our name (core-identity) is changed and what that means…\n\nVerse 1: I was lost in shame\n\nCould not get past my blame\n\nUntil He called my name\n\nI’m so glad He changed me\n\nSin, shame and blame entered our world after the Fall, but he calls us by a “new name”. As God says to Israel,\n\n…you will be called by a new name that the mouth of the Lord will bestow. -Isaiah 62:2b\n\nDarkness held me down\n\nBut Jesus pulled me out\n\nI’m no longer bound\n\nI’m so glad He changed me\n\nJust so you know, most of the metaphors in this song (darkness, blindness, light, freedom from prison) are from Isaiah 42:7. Jesus later read this passage and said that he fulfilled it. Jesus is…\n\n…A light for the Gentiles, to open eyes that are blind, to free captives from prison and to release from the dungeon those who sit in darkness. -Isaiah 42:7\n\nBut the core of this song is about identity. Let’s get back to it. The pre-chorus is almost verbatim from 2 Corinthians!\n\nPre-Chorus: See I’m, now a new creation in Christ\n\nThe old has gone, there’s new life\n\nI live by faith, not by sight\n\nOr as the Bible says…\n\nIf anyone is in Christ, the new creation has come: The old has gone, the new is here! –2 Corinthians 5:17\n\nFor we live by faith, not by sight. –2 Corinthians 5:7\n\nAnd then we hit the chorus. We’ve already talked about the first two lines that come from Charles Miles…\n\nChorus: There is a new name written down in glory\n\nAnd it’s mine, yes, it’s mine\n\nI’ve met the author of my story\n\nAnd He’s mine, yes, He’s mine\n\nDid you catch the last two lines? They come directly from Hebrews and affirm that Jesus has already written our life’s story with both a beginning and end. Hebrews 12 says we are,\n\n…Looking unto Jesus, the author and finisher of our faith, who for the joy that was set before Him endured the cross, despising the shame, and has sat down at the right hand of the throne of God.\n\nVerse 2: Sin had left me blind\n\nBut Jesus opened my eyes\n\nNow I can see the light\n\nI’m so glad He changed me\n\nBIBLE GEEK SIDENOTE! I find it so interesting tracking themes through the scriptures. The first time that we find the phrase “eyes were opened” is after Adam and Eve fall into sin and shame…\n\nThen the eyes of both of them were opened, and they realized they were naked…-Genesis 3:7\n\nBut when Jesus quotes Isaiah, he tells us that he came to “open eyes”. Not only that, when he appears to the disciples on the Road to Emmaus we read,\n\nThen their eyes were opened and they recognized him[Jesus]…-Luke 24:31\n\nSo it seems that Adam and Eve’s eyes were opened to sin and that is really blindness. We THINK we can see clearly, but we only see who we are AFTER Jesus opens our eyes. That was just a side-note…back to the song…\n\nNow I’m walking free\n\nI’ve got the victory\n\nSee it’s all over me\n\nI’m so glad He changed me\n\nLastly, the bridge tells us that the I AM defines who we are. But who is the I AM? Back in Exodus, God gives tells Moses that this is his name.\n\nGod said to Moses, “I AM WHO I AM. This is what you are to say to the Israelites: ‘I AM has sent me to you.’” -Exodus 3:14\n\nLater, Jesus claims to be the same I AM…\n\n“Very truly I tell you,” Jesus answered, “before Abraham was born, I AM!” -John 8:58\n\nSo God is the great I AM, but what are we? In his book, “Who Am I?:Identity in Christ”, author Jerry Bridges answers this question by pointing us to scripture. He says there are 8 ways to biblically define ourselves. These 8 “I am…” statements are:\n\nI Am Created. I Am in Christ. I Am Justified. I Am an Adopted Son/Daughter of God. I Am a New Creation. I Am a Saint. I Am a Servant of Jesus Christ. I Am Not Yet Perfect.\n\nIn other words,\n\nBridge: I am who I am because the I AM tells me who I am."
