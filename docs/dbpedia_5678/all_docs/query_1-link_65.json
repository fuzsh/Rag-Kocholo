        "text": "Post Malone has released his debut country album - one of the biggest releases this year, across all genres - on August 16th under the title, F-1 Trillion. It follows a lengthy spell of tantalising teasers and surprise performances, with Posty immersing himself in the Nashville scene over the past six months or so.\n\nExcitingly, on the release date, Post Malone surprised his loyal fans by dropping a deluxe version of F-1Trillion featuring nine additional solo tracks, including âKilled a Manâ, âDead in a Honky Tonkâ, âBack to Texasâ, âHey Mercedesâ, âAin't How It Endsâ and âGo to Hellâ.\n\nF-1Trillion features an Avengers-style array of the biggest stars in country music, with the dazzling tracklist including contributions from Morgan Wallen, Dolly Parton, Lainey Wilson, Luke Combs, Chris Stapleton, HARDY, Hank Williams Jr., Tim McGraw, ERNEST, Brad Paisley, Sierra Ferrell, Billy Strings, Blake Shelton and Jelly Roll. There are also three solo cuts on the original version of F-1Trillion, Posty's sweet, vulnerable ode to his daughter, âYoursâ, as well as âWhat Don't Belong to Meâ and âRight About Youâ.\n\nOn Friday, May 10th, Post Malone delighted fans by ushering in his country era by releasing his long-teased and long-awaited Morgan Wallen collaboration, âI Had Some Helpâ.\n\nLater in May, Post Malone performed âI Had Some Helpâ and the traditional-leaning, steel-soaked âNever Love You Againâ at the 2024 ACM Awards, before following this up with another unreleased teaser, this time featuring country legend, Blake Shelton, on a track called âPour Me a Drinkâ. Both of these are set to appear on Posty's star-studded country album, with âPour Me a Drinkâ dropping on June 21st.\n\nThe next single to arrive was the first original country song Post Malone had ever teased, the infectious âGuy For Thatâ with Luke Combs, which was released on July 26th in tandem with a hilarious music video filmed along Nashville's Broadway strip.\n\nOn Father's Day, Post Malone treated his followers to a sneak preview of a heartwarming new track, the sweet, endearing ode to his daughter, âYoursâ. The song was co-written by Posty, Ashley Gorley, ERNEST, Charlie Handsome and Taylor Phillips.\n\nOn June 26th, Post Malone continued to expand his dizzying collection of star-studded guests and unveiled a snippet of yet another blockbuster duet, this time with Chris Stapleton on a Southern Rock-fuelled track seemingly titled, âCalifornia Soberâ.\n\nDuring the bearded crooner's âA Night in Nashvilleâ set in early July, he treated the crowd to a slew of special guests, ranging from Blake Shelton to Joe Nichols to Sierra Ferrell, with the latter featuring on âNever Love You Againâ. Posty also debuted the brooding âHide My Gunâ with HARDY, another highly anticipated F-1Trillion duet.\n\nThe first hints at the album's title arose during Post Malone's set at Bonnaroo Festival in mid-June. A grainy photo popped up online, apparently taken from the merch stand, of a t-shirt revealing the title of Posty's forthcoming debut country album to be âF-1 Trillionâ. The text on the tee reads, ââPour Me a Drinkâ is a song featuring Blake Shelton on Post Malone's new album, F-1,000,000,000,000â.\n\nAdding weight to the initial speculation was the fact that Post Malone had started following a TikTok account called âF-ONETRILLIONâ. The page, which has no videos as of yet, follows only Posty's artist account and his official fan-page, ExtraPosty. The name, which is a fun twist on the classic Ford F-150 truck - a frequently referenced image in country music - undoubtedly feels like a fitting title for the project, symbolising how Post Malone has brought his own style and sound to country music, rather than changing who he is in order to fit into the genre.\n\nAptly, the F-1Trillion artwork features an upturned two-tone truck suspended atop an expansive lake, with Posty confirming on his socials that the piece was created by Gonzalo Lebrija.\n\nWith Post Malone having now shared a plethora of snippets of unreleased music and new singles with some of the biggest stars on the planet, Morgan Wallen, Blake Shelton and Luke Combs, the project's arrival continues to inch closer and closer.\n\nPrior to the official announcement, which came on June 18th, Posty confirmed during a Twitch live stream last year that his âcountry record is comingâ, before sharing he recorded a song for the project when he was in Nashville that he couldn't stop singing. He also revealed that he's been working on two albums, with one being the country project, and the other possibly being a more mainstream release.\n\nThis followed Posty's post-CMA Awards performance interview, where he responded to the question of whether it was time to record a country album with âI think so. Yes, ma'amâ.\n\nIn 2023, Post Malone was photographed during a recording session with two of Music City's primary songsmiths, Morgan Wallen and Ernest, before being snapped alongside two more members of Nashville's songwriting royalty, Luke Combs and James McNair.\n\nIn February, Post Malone shared a teaser of âGuy For Thatâ with Luke Combs, which has now been released and seems to be the result of the session with Combs and McNair.\n\nExcitingly, before dropping âGuy For Thatâ, Posty confirmed he has a second collaboration with Luke Combs on F-1Trillion, the title of which has now been unveiled as the previously teased âMissinâ You Like Thisâ - a song HARDY appears to have co-written. On March 13, Post Malone took to his socials to upload a demo of âMissinâ You Like Thisâ, which features the New York native's signature ethereal vocals floating across a sparse, brooding guitar and drum instrumental.\n\nLater that month, Posty shared a new snippet of his Morgan Wallen duet, âI Had Some Helpâ, which Morgan had previously teased and then deleted shortly before Christmas. Although the sense of anticipation is at a fever-pitch ahead of any new music from Post Malone, âI Had Some Helpâ was definitely the one fans had been clamouring for the most out of all the snippets and demos he'd been uploading.\n\nThere was a bizarre rumour that the infectious, uptempo track was going to arrive on April 5th, but that day disappointingly came and went without any new music from Posty. It then dropped on Friday, May 10th, accompanied by a fun, playful music video.\n\nIn the lead-up to the F-1Trillion announcement, Jelly Roll repeatedly expressed his admiration for Post Malone's sonic blueprint, with the duo linking up backstage during the CMA Awards 2023, as well as during the Reportinâ For Duty tribute to Leslie Jordan in February.\n\nWith Jelly Roll having previously underlined his eagerness to hit the studio with Posty, we suspected the âNeed A Favorâ maverick was another name we could expect to appear on the album's tracklist - and thankfully, our suspicions were confirmed in late July, when Jelly was excitingly unveiled as the guest vocalist on âLosersâ.\n\nIn addition to Colter wall's outlaw aesthetic and the Hip-Hop-minded country fusion that Morgan Wallen, Ernest and Jelly Roll have pioneered, as we attempt to pin down what kind of record we can expect from Post Malone's debut country effort, we imagine there'll also be a notable retro-country influence on the project.\n\nPosty has shared stellar covers of classics such as Hank Williamsâ âHonky Tonk Bluesâ, Toby Keith's âCourtesy of the Red, White and Blueâ, Brad Paisley's âI'm Gonna Miss Herâ and Sturgill Simpson's âYou Can Have The Crownâ. His first âofficialâ foray into the genre was his reimagined HIXTAPE duet with the late Joe Diffie, âPick-Up Manâ.\n\nIt looks like all those vision-board collages we created of Post Malone wearing cowboy hats have finally paid off. It's official - Posty has released his debut country album, and it's already plain to see that F-1Trillion is a game-changing moment for the genre."
