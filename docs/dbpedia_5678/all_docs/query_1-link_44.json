        "text": "Mustafa, the Toronto artist formerly known as Mustafa the Poet, has shared his first new song since dropping his album When Smoke Rises in 2021. “Name of God” was co-produced by Aaron Dessner, Simon Hessman, and Mustafa, and it comes with a self-directed video. Watch it below.\n\nIn the visual for his new song, Mustafa sings along to “Name of God” while dancing in different scenarios: surrounded by people dressed in traditional Muslim garb, hands undressing him, and a number of weapons pointed at his face. He also rides on the back of a motorcycle on the highway while draped in a Sudanese flag. At the end, a dedication to his late brother Mohamed, who died this summer, appears on the screen."
