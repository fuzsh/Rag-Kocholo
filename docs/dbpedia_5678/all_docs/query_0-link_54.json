        "text": "“Hallelujah! Sing to God a brand new song, praise him in the company of all who love him. Let [everyone] celebrate their Sovereign Creator…” (Psalm 149, ‘The Message’ translation)\n\nThese verses capture the energy and joy we’ve felt in writing and performing these hymns with our friends. The core of The Newsong Group is Andrew D. Brewis. Airlie Scott and Tamsin Bland, three friends who’ve enjoyed making music together for years, but for this first recording project we drew in singers from three generations, a range of musicians, and the compositional and mentoring talents of Tamsin’s mum, Fenella Bennetts. After the album was launched in 2007, we know these songs were sung in Sunday Schools, churches and youth gatherings all over the world, and this spurred us on to produce three more albums and an EP.\n\nAlso available:\n\nSongburst: the MP3 album\n\nIndividual tracks in the Downloads shop\n\nTrack listing and songs samples can be found below."
