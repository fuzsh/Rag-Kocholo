        "text": "Jelly Roll continues to be everywhere: In Alabama, singing Skynyrd with Lana Del Rey, in Dallas, duetting with Kid Rock, and on Tuesday, in Los Angeles to perform a new song on the season finale of The Voice.\n\nThe poignant acoustic track finds the singer dealing with mental health issues despite a facade where everything seems alright on the surface.\n\n“I am not OK, I’m barely getting by/I’m losing track of days, I’m losing sleep at night/I am not okay, I’m hanging on the rails/So if I say I’m fine, just know I learned to hide it well,” Jelly Roll sings on the track.\n\n“I know I can’t be the only one who’s holding on for dear life/But I know God knows when it’s all said and done/I’m not okay, but it’s all gonna be alright/It’s not OK, but we’re all gonna be alright.”\n\nTrending\n\n“I Am Not OK” stands as the second preview of Jelly Roll’s upcoming LP, his first since his breakout album Whitsitt Chapel arrived in June 2023. Last week, at the 2024 ACM Awards, Jelly Roll debuted “Liar,” another track that’s also likely destined for his new album. Jelly Roll has not yet announced a release date for either single or his next LP."
