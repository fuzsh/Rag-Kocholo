        "text": "London collective Lunch Money Life have shared their new song ‘In Jesus Name’.\n\nThe group’s new album ‘The God Phone’ is overwhelmingly ambitious, laid down at North London audio complex Church Studios. The record is incoming, featuring the band stretched to the limit through their jazz-adjacent artistry.\n\nNew song ‘In Jesus Name’ is a slick piece of 80s leaning soul, the gospel aspect perhaps nodding to one member’s side hustle as a church organist. A powerful slice of songwriting, it finds Lunch Money Life grappling with some of the biggest themes of all.\n\nA broad, widescreen piece of work, ‘In Jesus Name’ is aided by the contributions of Love Interest, with the soulful poise elevated by a local choir. One of the most daring releases yet from Lunch Money Life, the group comment…\n\n“‘In Jesus Name’ is another track that seems to have been divinely delivered into our hands, lungs and tongues. It was made even more special by our dear friend Love Interest’s contribution. We wanted to pack it with as much drama and emotion as we could so we tapped up a local choir who elevated it to realms we could never have imagined…”\n\nTune in now."
