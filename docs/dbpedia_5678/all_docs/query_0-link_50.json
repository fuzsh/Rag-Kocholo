        "text": "Jelly Roll delivered a powerful message on the season finale of The Voice Tuesday (May 21), debuting a vulnerable new song titled “I Am Not OK” from his upcoming album.\n\nShrouded in fog, the country star took center stage to give the unreleased ballad its world premiere on the singing competition series’ final episode of season 25, which also saw performances from Lainey Wilson, Kate Hudson, The Black Keys, Muni Long, Thomas Rhett and more.\n\n“I am not OK, I’m barely getting by/ I’m losing track of days, I’m losing sleep at night,” he sang over gentle acoustic guitars, an occasional raspiness accenting his voice. “I know I can’t be the only one who’s holding on for dear life/ But I know God knows, when it’s all said and done/ I am not OK, but it’s all gonna be alright.”\n\nThe new song is set to appear on Jelly’s upcoming album, which will follow 2023’s Whitsitt Chapel. Featuring the hit single “Need a Favor” and Wilson collaboration “Save Me,” the 13-track LP reached No. 3 on the Billboard 200 last year.\n\nThe Voice season finale also saw contestant Asher HaVon taking the crown Tuesday night, securing a win for Reba McEntire’s team. The latest installment of the hit singing competition series also featured Chance the Rapper, Dan + Shay and John Legend as coaches.\n\nThough a new era is imminent for Jelly, the “Son of a Sinner” singer is still fresh off a successful awards season thanks to Whitsitt Chapel. Most recently, he and Wilson won music event of the year at the 2024 ACM Awards, where he also premiered another unreleased song called “Liar.”\n\nWatch Jelly’s performance on The Voice finale above."
