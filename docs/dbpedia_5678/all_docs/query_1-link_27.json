This Song Name Generator tool will give you countless title ideas, offering diverse song name mixes by mood and genre of your choice.\n\nThis song name ideas generator is the best place to find creative song titles, ensuring cool, memorable, and meaningful titles for tracks every time.\n\nNaming a song is as important as writing it, and looking for a perfect name for your track is worth it. The song’s name often makes the first impression on your audience as an artist or music creator. It can attract attention immediately and encourage listeners to press the play button. However, there are times when a catchy title doesn’t emerge from the song’s hook. Choosing the perfect track title for your masterpiece isn’t always easy; it can be a tough process that requires a lot of brainstorming and research. As such, the name deserves your best effort.\n\nMost people usually use a word or phrase from the song lyrics as the title. But using a phrase or word that fits the song’s theme and is not in the lyrics can create a pretty creative name. Also, not all songs have lyrics, but they still need titles.\n\nWe are here to help you. With this song name generator tool, you can easily and quickly find creative song title ideas.\n\n*If you prefer numbers or animals in the song’s title or are just searching for used song names, you can use the song title search tool. It helps you find used song names with colors, numbers, food, animals, days, or any specific word you want.\n\nUsing the Song Name Generator tool is very simple. Generate many good song names in seconds. It will give you 20 random titles with every click, offering choices from over 10 genres and moods, covering almost all kinds of songs.

The song title generator is designed to be easy to use. Just select the mood that represents the emotional effect of the music from the mood list (drop-down list) and/or choose the genre of the song you’re looking for, then click the Generate button.\n\nIt will give you 40 random song titles to choose from. Need more names? Click on the “Show More” button to get another 40 titles and so on. You can change the genre or mood anytime; just hit the “Generate Again” button to reset and go to the top of the page, where you can change them.\n\nIf you don’t choose a mood or genre, the title generator will create random names from all available genres and moods. This generator has two extra helpful features:\n\nSong titles search feature\n\nAfter you generate titles and choose your favorite one, you often want to know how unique that song title is! That is why we added a “Check If Unique?” feature that helps you search for that song name instantly on Spotify.\n\nIf you want to search for songs with titles similar to your choice, simply press the “Check If Unique?” button under every name to see if the name is unique or if there are any songs similar to it on Spotify.\n\nStore Your favorite song titles feature\n\nBy clicking the star icon under every title, you can save your favorite names. So you can generate as many as you want without worrying about forgetting your favorites. To see your favorite collection, hit the “Saved Ideas” button.\n\nWho can use Song title generator?\n\nSometimes a name can be the only thing standing between you and a new release! This song title maker is very helpful for artists, bands, composers, and music creators, especially artists who compose many songs or music tracks and don’t have much time to think about the names.\n\nIt will also help creators who make Royalty Free music or creative commons music\n\nHow does this Song Name Generator work?\n\nAt the click of a button, this song title generator will randomly combine carefully selected groups of words from a large database that includes all forms of music and illustrates the artwork in music to quickly create thousands of new, unused track titles or album names, regardless of your music genre.\n\nPlease note that due to the randomness of this song title creator, some titles may seem silly or have faulty grammar, but don’t let that stop you. There’s plenty to pick from. You are sure to find some inspiration.\n\nGenerated names will stimulate your imagination, so you can also add your own word to the mix for the song title creator to work its magic on, or simply click the “More Names” button again and again until you get the perfect name for your masterpiece.\n\nThe names in this generator are loosely based on words commonly used in songs and the music field.\n\nDon’t worry if any of these generated titles have already been used in songs because a title can’t be copyrighted. Feel free to use them. You can also change a word or two or let them suggest a new idea. They provide a little push.\n\nWe decided to pick the genres listed below as they’re the most popular genres. Even if your music is a metal song or rap song or whatever, many names could fit different classifications within any genre.\n\nThe Genres are:\n\nPop\n\nRock\n\nHip Hop/Rap\n\nElectronic/Dance\n\nR&B/Soul\n\nJazz\n\nBlues\n\nCountry/Folk\n\nClassical\n\nLatin\n\nThe moods are:\n\nHappy\n\nRomance\n\nSleep\n\nParty\n\nRelax\n\nSad\n\nCan I use this tool as music album name ideas generator?\n\nAs the most common way to name an album is to use a song name from it that captures the overarching theme, you can use the generated names from this tool as album names.\n\nIf you want real song names to get ideas from for your music, you can use the Random songs Generator or Song Title Search that gives you a random list of real songs every time you hit the generate button.\n\nChosic has a new generators that is specialized in album names, try it here.\n\nWe hope this track name generator will give you good names for your music.
