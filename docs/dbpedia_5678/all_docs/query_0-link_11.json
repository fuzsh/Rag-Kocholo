        "text": "Eddie Middleton, the original lead singer for the group Newsong, passed away last weekend. He co-founded Newsong in 1981, after they began as a church band at Morningside Baptist Church in Valdosta, Georgia.\n\nMiddlelton was Newsong’s lead singer for 12 years, until 1993 when he left to pursue a solo career. He may be best known for the song “All Around The World.” He also recorded the original version of “Arise My Love” (seen here in the original 1987 live version featuring Eddie (with the mustache) and Billy Goodwin sharing lead vocals). It was re-recorded in 1994 featuring Russ Lee, which is the version most people know. Here is a live performance of the new version featuring Billy Goodwin (with beard) and Russ Lee at the 2010 National Religious Broadcasters convention.\n\nMiddleton had been suffering from various health issues recently, and then contracted COVID-19. Before he died, he wrote an inspiring message to his followers:\n\n\"As I prepare to soon meet Jesus, the greatest desire of my heart is for you to know that Jesus saved and changed my life and He wants to save and change yours. No matter how far you’ve run, He is ready to receive you into relationship with Him. The wisest thing you could ever do is to get to know personally the One who created you, who has a plan for your life, and who knows about all that you’ve ever done and will do.\"\n\nEddie Middleton died August 21 at the age of 74. He is survived by his wife and four children."
