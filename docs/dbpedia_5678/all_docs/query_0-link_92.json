        "text": "The Voice alums and real-life love birds Gwen Stefani and Blake Shelton released a new song together in February 2024.\n\nOn February 5, Stefani officially announced the name of the new single with her husband, Shelton: ''Purple Irises.'' She revealed the news to fans by sharing a scenic photo of herself lounging in a retro style living room wearing a denim jumpsuit, while Shelton strums a guitar and smiles like the proud cowboy he is. The single dropped February 9, 2024.\n\nCheck out the gorgeous cover art for ''Purple Irises'' here.\n\nBlake Shelton and Gwen Stefani's new song, \"'Purple Irises\": what to know\n\nStefani dropped hints to fans about the upcoming tune on January 29 when she shared an artsy polaroid of herself and Shelton placed in front of some — you guessed it — purple irises to Instagram. She then posted the same bouquet of flowers the next day placed next to a handwritten love note that Shelton had given her. Symbolism much?\n\nThe title ''Purple Irises'' is totally fitting to the theme of their love life, as the two have a garden together that they love tending to.\n\nRELATED: Blake Shelton Makes the Quickest Cameo in Gwen Stefani's New Gardening Video\n\n''Purple Irises'' by Blake Shelton and Gwen Stefani lyrics\n\nBut if someone comes along and tries to love you like I love you\n\nDon't know what I'd do, don't wanna lose you\n\nEverything fades\n\nEverything dies\n\nPut me in a vase, but you can't\n\nYou can't stop time\n\nIt's not 1999\n\nBut this face is still mine\n\nThe way you look at me\n\nI swear my heart hits rewind\n\nBut if someone comes along and tries to love you like I love you\n\nDon't know what I'd do, don't wanna lose you\n\nIf someone comes along and tries to take you, tries to make you\n\nDon't let 'em change your mind\n\nWonder why you took a risk\n\nOn a broken hеart you cannot fix\n\nNo, I never knew a lovе like this\n\nNow I'm picking purple irises\n\nI got you\n\nAnd you got me\n\nAnd do you still think I'm pretty?\n\nAnd are you happy?\n\nIt's not 2014\n\nBut you still look good in those jeans\n\nLookin' in the mirror\n\nDo you see what I see?\n\nBut if someone comes along and tries to love you like I love you\n\nDon't know what I'd do, don't wanna lose you\n\nIf someone comes along and tries to take you, tries to make you\n\nDon't let 'em change your mind\n\nWonder why you took a risk\n\nOn a broken heart you cannot fix\n\nNo, I never knew a love like this\n\nNow I'm picking purple irises\n\nAnd we're blooming into the change\n\nI'm overthinking it\n\nPicking purple irises\n\nAnd leaving love stains\n\nI got violet memories\n\nI'm overthinking it\n\nOh, and leaving love stains\n\nLove stains\n\nBut if someone comes along and tries to love you like I love you\n\nDon't know what I'd do, don't wanna lose you\n\nIf someone comes along and tries to take you, tries to make you\n\nDon't let 'em change your mind\n\nOh, if someone comes along and tries to love you like I love you\n\nDon't know what I'd do, don't wanna lose you\n\nIf someone comes along and tries to take you, tries to make you\n\nDon't let 'em change your mind\n\nWonder why you took a risk\n\nOn a broken heart you cannot fix\n\nNo, I never knew a love like this\n\nNow I'm picking purple irises\n\nGwen Stefani and Blake Shelton's songwriting adventures\n\nThis song certainly isn't the first collab between Stefani and Shelton.They've recorded and performed a number of gorgeous duets together: ''Go Ahead and Break My Heart'' was released off Shelton's 2016 album If I'm Honest; ''You Make it Feel Like Christmas'' is a song off of Stefani's 2017 album of the same name; and ''No Body But You'' and ''Happy Anywhere'' were both released in 2020. Most recently, Stefani and Shelton paid tribute to The Judds with a heartfelt cover of the country tune ''Love Is Alive.'' Listen to it here.\n\nRELATED: Blake Shelton Got Gwen Stefani the Most Extravagant Valentine's Day Flowers\n\nStefani and Shelton are two creative peas in a pod. In an October 2023 interview with Variety, Stefani gave some insight into the songwriting process between herself and and her husband. In fact, she revealed that she and Shelton wrote ''Go Ahead and Break My Heart'' together through text messages a month into their relationship.\n\n“We wrote a song together probably the first month we started talking or hanging out,” she told the outlet. “It was when we were like, ‘This is not gonna happen. What are we doing? We’re insane. We’re both broken. We’ve got to figure our lives out.’ He wrote this verse and sent it to me: ‘Help me finish this song.’ I wrote a verse and sent it back to him. We were just basically texting at that point. We wrote this song, and I went in and sang on it.”"
