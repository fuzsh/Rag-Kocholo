        "text": "In the age of the Father, the name of the Savior was Jehovah according to the Old Testament prophets (Isa 43:11). And as understood from studying the Trinity, God the Father and God the Son are the same God. That is why, in the age of the Son, the name of the Savior was Jesus (Ac 4:11–12).\n\nJesus said these words while He taught people that we can have eternal life through His flesh and blood (Mt 26:17, 26–28). And the only way to receive His flesh (manna) and blood is through the New Covenant Passover. However, the Passover was abolished in A.D. 325. That is why, in the book of Revelation, Jesus described the Passover (manna) as hidden.\n\nNevertheless, Christ Ahnsahnghong reestablished the New Covenant Passover in 1948. He accomplished what is written in Revelation; He gave us the hidden manna. This makes Him Second Coming Jesus. Those who receive this manna by celebrating the New Covenant Passover also receive His new name.\n\nJesus’ new name, the name of the Savior in this age of the Holy Spirit, is Christ Ahnsahnghong."
