        "text": "Charles Wesley Godwin’s new album can’t come soon enough.\n\nAfter signing a record deal with Nashville label Big Loud in March, he revealed that a new record called Family Ties was pretty much done and should be coming out at some point this year.\n\nAnd earlier today, he dropped an incredible acoustic video of a new song called “Christian Name,” which finds him in the midst of a breakup, questioning his faith and wishing he could be different and make things right with the girl he loves:\n\n“I’m named after a great and faithful man\n\nThey were said to talk with God and that I could never understand\n\nTrying to replace you with the lookalikes on high street\n\nBut lookalikes don’t look just like the girl that called my street home\n\nWhen I ask God why I’m left with no one to blame\n\nBut my Christian name, oh, my Christian name”\n\nNow we won’t know for sure if this one made the final cut for tracklist until they officially make the album announcement with a release date and all of that, but I’m already obsessed with this song and really hope that we get to hear a studio cut soon.\n\nAnd if it’s is any indication of what’s to come, I think we’re in for something really special with CWG #3.\n\nDo yourself a favor and check it out:\n\n“‘Christian Name.’ Straight out of the notebook. Enjoy!”\n\nCWG most recently put out his Live From The Church EP in February.\n\n“Temporary Town”\n\nIn addition to the new album coming sometime this year (hopefully sooner rather than later), Charles is opening for his friend Zach Bryan on the Burn, Burn, Burn tour this summer.\n\nCharles Wesley Godwin 2023 tour dates:"
