        "text": "Synopsis\n\nKanye West, the prolific rapper and artist, has reignited controversy by referencing Taylor Swift in his latest song \"Carnival.\" The internet is abuzz with reactions, evoking memories of their past feud and triggering a renewed wave of backlash against West.\n\nKanye West, the prolific rapper and artist, has once again stirred controversy by dropping Taylor Swift's name in his latest song \"Carnival.\" The internet is buzzing with reactions, bringing back memories of their past feud and sparking a fresh wave of backlash against West. This incident unfolded during a listening experience for West's new album with Ty Dolla Sign in New York City. Let's delve into the details surrounding this latest mention and the ensuing online backlash.\n\nSwift Mentioned Again After 8 Years:\n\nIn a surprising move, the 46-year-old rapper has revisited history by referencing Taylor Swift in his new song \"Carnival.\" This comes eight years after the infamous incident that significantly impacted Swift's mental health. In 2016, West's lyrics included, “I feel like me and Taylor might still have sex/ Why? I made that b***h famous.” The recent mention in \"Carnival\" is part of a string of references that also include accused rapist Bill Cosby and billionaire Elon Musk.\n\nLyrics and Internet Backlash:\n\nThe lyrics in question are raising eyebrows, with West comparing himself to Bill Cosby, Puff Daddy, and proclaiming to be the \"new Jesus.\" The specific lines related to Taylor Swift state, “I mean since Taylor Swift, since I had a Rollie on the wrist / I'm the new Jesus, b*h / I turned water into Kris / This for what they did to Chris / They can't do st with this.” This mention has ignited a frenzy online, with fans expressing their disapproval and concerns about the choice of references.\n\nTaylor Swift and Elon Musk's Silence:\n\nDespite the uproar, Taylor Swift has not responded to West's latest mention in \"Carnival.\" Similarly, Elon Musk, who is also mentioned in the lyrics, has remained silent on the matter. The lines directed at Musk include, “Elon, where my rocketship? It's time to go home.” The lack of immediate responses from the involved parties adds an air of suspense to the unfolding situation.\n\nFan Reactions and Online Commentary:\n\nThe online community has been quick to react, with fans expressing their disappointment and frustration. Some pointed out the juxtaposition of mentioning Taylor Swift alongside individuals facing serious allegations. One fan commented, “Mentioning Taylor’s name next to a bunch of men who are sex offenders is definitely a choice.”\n\nAnother fan lamented, “Not the Taylor name dropping again, I thought we’d moved past this .” The controversy has led to a surge in online commentary, with Kanye West's fans and critics alike adding their perspectives to the discussion.\n\nKanye West's decision to mention Taylor Swift in his latest song \"Carnival\" has reignited a contentious chapter in their history. The online backlash reflects the sensitivity surrounding such references, especially considering the broader context of the lyrics. As the internet buzzes with discussions, the involved parties' silence only adds more intrigue to the unfolding drama, leaving fans and onlookers eager to see how this latest controversy will evolve.\n\nFAQs:\n\nHow many #1 does Kanye have?\n\nHe holds the distinction of being the second-highest certified American digital singles artist in the United States, with 84 of his singles achieving platinum status. His Billboard Hot 100 record includes 107 entries, 56 top 40s, 18 top 10s, and four number-one singles.\n\nWhy is Kanye West so popular?\n\nHe wields significant influence in various domains.
