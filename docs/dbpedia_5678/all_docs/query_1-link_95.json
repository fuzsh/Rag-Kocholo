        "text": "Lil Nas X has teased fans with a snippet of a track called Call Me By Your Name.\n\nThe Grammy Award-winning rapper shared 38-seconds of the upbeat rap anthem on social media, which includes lyrics such as: “Call me when you want, call me when you need, call me in the morning, I’ll be on the way.”\n\nThe song is expected to be included on Lil Nas X’s forthcoming debut album, which – according to his Twitter bio – is 92% done.\n\nIn 2019, the star made countless headlines when he came out as gay. Despite this, his music so far hasn’t explicitly addressed his sexuality – but that’s something he’s going to change on his upcoming album.\n\n“I 100% want to represent the LGBT community,” he said in a recent interview with The Guardian, confirming his new album will explore his queer identity and adding that he wants his social advocacy to be “through my art”.\n\nLil Nas X also acknowledged that while he may be an icon for young LGBTQ people, he doesn’t feel comfortable encouraging everyone to come out if they’re not 100% ready as it can be “super hard” for teens who don’t have accepting family.\n\n“It’s easier for me. I’m not depending on anybody. There’s no one who’s going to kick me out of the house – nobody to start treating me shitty,” he explained, adding that this might not be the case for “another 20-year-old who doesn’t quite have it figured out and still lives with his parents”.\n\nHe also said that his family knows that he’s gay, but it’s “not something that’s ever brought up or we speak about”.\n\nEarlier this year, Lil Nas X took home Best Music Video and Best Pop Duo/Group Performance at the 2020 Grammys for Old Town Road, which became the longest-running number one in history on the Billboard Hot 100.\n\nIt spent 19 consecutive weeks in the pole position, three weeks longer than the two previous record holders; One Sweet Day by Mariah Carey and Boyz II Men (1995–96); and Despacito by Luis Fonsi and Daddy Yankee featuring Justin Bieber (2016).\n\nDuring its reign, Lil Nas X came out as gay, becoming the first artist to do so while having a number one song.\n\nHe later became the second openly gay man, after Elton John, to earn a diamond-certification for a single. According to Billboard, Old Town Road has reached sales (and streaming equivalent sales) of 10 million units."
