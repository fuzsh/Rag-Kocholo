        "text": "You can claimÂ your artist pageÂ from either the Apple Music for Artists iOS app or the Apple Music for Artists website.Â\n\nApple grantsÂ AdministratorÂ access to the first artist or artist manager that requests to claim the profile. Once that Administrator gains access, they can add additional team members like label representatives, for example.\n\nÂ\n\nIf it has been more than 10 business days and you have not received communication about your applicationâs status, contact usÂ for assistance. Be sure to check the email inbox associated with your Apple ID.\n\nIf you were previously granted access to your artist page but can no longer access your profile, be sure to check that you are using the correct login credentials. If you are still unable to locate your profile, contact us.\n\nIf you cannot remember your Apple ID or password, go to Apple ID SupportÂ for assistance with recovering your Apple ID andÂ resetting yourÂ password.\n\nAlbums from multiple artists can appear on the same artist page, especially if they have the same name. In these instances, the iTunes Store will either create a new page or move the album to the correct artist page.Â\n\nTo correct this issue, contact us,Â select Artist Page Issue as the topic, and provide the following information:\n\nAre you approved for Apple Music for Artists? (Yes/No):Â\n\nArtist name:Â\n\nLinks to all albums by the artist:Â\n\nLink to the correct artist page:\n\nTo obtain links to artist pages or albums in Apple Music, click the ellipsis, click Share Album or Share Artist, then click Copy Link.\n\nDistributors must follow specific guidelines to deliver yourÂ music.Â If you donât see yourÂ music live on Apple Music, contact your distributor for support as they have the tools and access to resolve this issue.\n\nShazam artist pages are created when your distributor delivers your music to Apple Music. The artist image that appears on the Shazam artist page links to the Apple Music for Artists Artist image submitted through Apple Music for Artists.Â\n\nIf you can not find your artist page in Shazam or it is incorrect, contact us."
