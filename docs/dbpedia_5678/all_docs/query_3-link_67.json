        "text": "In today’s digital age, celebrity success relies heavily on online popularity. With this in mind, new research has revealed the famous faces who have seen the biggest boom in online fame in 2023. Online casino site ICE36 took at look at this. Taking in data from Google searches, Instagram followers, likes and engagement rates, they determined the celebrities who saw the greatest increase in online popularity in 2023. This group of celebrities consists of a diverse list of athletes, musicians, and actors.\n\nPer Statista, in 2023, over 4.89 billion people were using social media worldwide, a number projected to increase to almost six billion in 2027. These users aren’t tied to a single platform. The average user now spreads their digital footprint across six to seven platforms every month, according to Forbes.\n\nRELATED: Scarlett Johansson Is ‘Too Fragile’ To Be On Social Media\n\nThe average individual has about eight social media accounts. In the United States, the average person has seven accounts. In India the number is nearly twelve, while in Japan it nears four. On a global level, the average person spends about 145 minutes on social media. Americans average about two hours and seven minutes daily. To put this into perspective, if the average person maintained this usage over an average life span of 73 years, the end result is an astonishing 5.7 years spent on social media platforms."
