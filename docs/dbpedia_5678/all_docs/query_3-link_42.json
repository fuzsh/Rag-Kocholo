        "text": "\"Who the f**k is Chet Faker?\" Do we know anymore?\n\nThe artist formerly known as Nick Murphy, who was then formerly known as Chet Faker, is finding his way to answering that question with the release of his first music under the Chet moniker in 'Low'.\n\nClearing and then rebooting his socials this week, there wasn't much to go on when it came to figuring out why Murphy decided to pivot back to his original project.\n\nFans will be glad though, 'Low' proves to be a return to form; like a warm hug from a mate you thought you'd never see again.\n\nAgainst a simple arrangement of bass, grooves, strings and guitar, Chet Faker's bluesy vocals drive moments of melancholy pop to light.\n\nThe song harks back to earlier material without being wholly derivative; it's a great way for Murphy to reintroduce Chet Faker to the audience.\n\n\"Just because I feel low / Right now / Doesn't mean all that I've got / Has run out...\" he croons.\n\nWhen Bridget premiered 'Low' last night (Thursday), the text line went off for Chet Faker's return.\n\nWhatever the weirdness of the name 180, 'Low' pulled in all the love.\n\n☏ I don't care what he wants to call himself. He makes good music.\n\n☏ CHET IS BACK!! This is smootthhhhhhh. Play it again!! Charlie from Gold Coast\n\n☏ Are you kidding me! Every shortlist for top 10 in the h100\n\n☏ Holy F, I'm crying. This is so good. He's back! Phoebe from Newy\n\n☏ Welcome back Chet Faker. Oh how we've missed you! Jac\n\n'Low' is the first single from Chet Faker since 2015; the Marcus Marr-collaborative EP Work being the last we heard from the musician.\n\nAt the time, Murphy explained that there was 'an evolution happening', and that his decision to release music under his own name was simply to explore that new direction.\n\nSince then, the musician has dropped a number of projects under the Nick Murphy name; including 2017's Missing Link EP and last year's Run Fast Sleep Naked album.\n\nMaking 'Missing Link': How Nick Murphy moved on from Chet Faker with his new EP\n\nWith a new record deal and label signing news coming with the release of 'Low' today, we guess we'll be seeing just how this new era of Chet Faker manifests in 2021."
