        "text": "If you’ve seen Prime Video’s Road House remake, you may have spotted a familiar face in the opening scene. That beefy boxing man, brawling in a cage like he’s in Sam Raimi’s Spider-Man? That’s good ol’ Post Malone. Oh, and the song thumping in the background as he pummels his opponent? That’s by Post Malone, too.\n\nEven better: The song, called “Horsepower,” is actually good. We all know that when an artist crafts a single specifically for a film (though it’s unclear if Posty made the track for Road House or if it’s from his next album), the results are usually rough. Unless it’s a Bond song. If you stick around for the film’s credits, you’ll hear an extended cut of the country-inspired track, which features lyrics about riding horses, zooming around town, and chasing dreams—all sung over a kick-ass electric guitar. Could this be an early contender for song of the summer? I think so.\n\nHere’s the catch: The song isn’t out yet. Post Malone hasn’t dropped “Horsepower” on any streaming platforms—and the artist hasn’t announced a release date for it, either. If we’re lucky, “Horsepower” will make its way into full radio rotation soon.\n\nTo celebrate his role in Road House, Post Malone posted some behind-the-scenes footage on Instagram. In the video, he says, “This is my first, like, real action sequence where I’m fighting. I’m having a great time. Everybody’s been so kind and [is] making me feel really comfortable. I’m honored to be, you know, a part of this beautiful process in this film. I’m super pumped to see how it goes.” The post’s caption? “Music and movies, what can’t he do?”"
