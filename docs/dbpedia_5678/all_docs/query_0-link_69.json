We believe in creating a space where people can have authentic encounters with Christ, discover their gifts and use them for God's glory. Join us for our Sunday services!\n\nAt New Song we are committed to preaching sermons based on the Biblical text (Exposition) that points to what Christ has done for us by his grace (Christ-Centered) and highlights our need for a Savior who is gracious and merciful (Sin/The Fall) in a manner that is culturally relevant and applicable so that individuals and families may grow in their understanding of God and His grace.\n\nMISSION: To connect people to Jesus Christ and One another in order to make disciples that that multiply and become God’s instruments of God’s grace, justice and mercy."
