Click here to listen to the new song.\n\n“’Call On The Name’ is a salvation song,” explains Cody Carnes. “It leads people through the call and the confession that scripture talks about. Romans 10 says, If you declare with your mouth, ‘Jesus is Lord,’ and believe in your heart that God raised him from the dead, you will be saved.. everyone who calls on the name of the Lord will be saved. I believe we’re stepping into a great harvest where many people are coming to know Jesus. I’m praying this song helps lead people into that confession of salvation! “\n\nLast summer, Carnes held a two-night live worship event at his church home base, The Belonging Co., in Nashville. The evenings produced his first-ever live album, God Is Good!, which was released last year as well as his upcoming project. Also from God Is Good!, Carnes received his first No. 1 radio single with the song “Ain’t Nobody,” which hit four consecutive weeks at the top on the Mediabase Christian Audience chart. Already in his career, Carnes has been nominated three times for a GRAMMY Award and currently has 15 songs on the CCLI Top 2000 chart as a songwriter."
