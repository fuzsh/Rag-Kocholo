        "text": "The post The Killers Share New Song “We Did It in the Name of Love”: Stream appeared first on Consequence.\n\nTo celebrate Christmas this year, The Killers have gifted fans with a new song titled “We Did It in the Name of Love.” For now, it’s only available via the band’s social media platforms.\n\n“Santa’s got a brand new song in his bag,” the group wrote in the caption accompanying the track. “Merry Christmas!” Stream it below.\n\nAs The Killers’ subreddit points out, vocalist Brandon Flowers mentioned “We Did It in the Name of Love” in an interview with The Current published this past summer. Speaking about the song, he and drummer Ronnie Vannucci Jr. explained how it was recorded at a little-used studio in the hills of Santa Cruz, California.\n\n“I needed to be close to home at the time; my wife was going to give birth any minute, so we just decided to rent this studio that hadn’t been touched since 1977,” Vannucci Jr. recalled. “There was not a computer in the studio, so we had to buy a computer and we basically hooked it up to his system. And we just started, you know, carving some songs.”\n\nFlowers added that the home studio is run by a guy named Ken (whose wife’s name is Barbie, naturally) and they had to share the space with the couple. During those sessions, they created “We Did It in the Name of Love,” which Flowers described as having “a little bit of a spirit of Sisters of Mercy.”\n\nEarlier this month, The Killers released a new greatest hits album, Rebel Diamonds, featuring the previously unreleased song “Spirit.” They’re set to kick off a run of shows in the UK and Ireland next June; get your tickets here.\n\nThe Killers Share New Song “We Did It in the Name of Love”: Stream\n\nEddie Fu\n\nPopular Posts\n\n10 Shoegaze Albums Slowdive's Simon Scott Thinks Everyone Should Own\n\nBobbie Jean Carter, Sister of Nick and Aaron Carter, Dead at 41\n\nEagles Add New 2024 Dates to Farewell Tour with Steely Dan\n\nLaura Lynch, Dixie Chicks Co-Founding Member, Killed in Car Crash\n\nThe 100 Greatest Albums of All Time\n\nDave Grohl Hand-Draws \"DIY Beer Bong\" and \"How to Smuggle Hash\" Diagrams for Charity Auction"
