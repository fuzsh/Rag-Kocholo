        "text": "(Gray News/TMX) - Sublime has released their first new song in nearly 30 years.\n\nThe new song titled, “Feel Like That” includes vocals from the band’s late frontman Bradley Nowell and his son, Jakob Nowell.\n\n1996, 28, was just 11 months old when his father was found dead of a heroin overdose on May 25, 1996, and has long considered his father’s bandmates to be uncles.\n\nLast month, he made his debut as Sublime’s new vocalist at Coachella.\n\n“This song came about in an organic way. My uncles and I always want to collab with artists in different modern music scenes,” Jakob Nowell shared. “But hearing my own voice on a track side by side with my dad’s voice really feels like the classic Sublime sound stepping into the modern era.”\n\nThe new song was produced by longtime Sublime collaborator Michael “Miguel” Happoldt, along with Stick Figure members Scott Woodruff and Johnny Cosmic.\n\n“Sublime is who inspired me to make music, being a part of this track is a full circle moment in so many ways. From the vault to the people, this one’s been a long time coming!” Woodruff said.\n\nBefore the song’s release, Woodruff told Rolling Stone that he used old recordings of Bradley Nowell, founding members Eric Wilson and Bud Gaugh from a 1996 jam session to create the track.\n\n“Good things come to those who wait … and wait … and wait,” Gaugh said. “We’ve been waiting too damn long!!! Now hear this!!! This is the good sh** that makes you ‘Fell Like That.’”\n\nJakob Nowell added, “SoCal music is my family’s pride and joy and our family is getting bigger every day. ‘Feel Like That’ captures this new sentiment and we want it to be the first of many.”\n\nThe band is also set to tour this summer, stopping at several festivals scheduled through the end of the year."
