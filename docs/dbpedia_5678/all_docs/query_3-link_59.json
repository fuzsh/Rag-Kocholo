        "text": "Well, looks like Kanye West is back in the news with Taylor Swift. We all know the drama that occurred years ago at the 2009 MTV Video Music Awards. It was one of the most shocking moments at an award show and is still often talked about. West ran up on stage and interrupted Swift’s acceptance speech to tell folks that he believed Beyonce should have won the award. In one of the most shocking moments on television, it led to a long-lasting feud.\n\nRecently, West dropped a new album with Ty Dolla $ign and slick name dropped Taylor Swift. On the 12th track on the album, he addresses Taylor Swift directly. The song is “Carnival” and says “Why she say she sucked my d*ck? (Ha) Then she say she ain’t sucked my dick (Ha) / She gon’ take it up the ass (Ha), like a ventriloquist (Ha) / I mean since Taylor Swift, (Ha) since I had the Rollie on the wrist (Ha) / I’m the new Jesus, bitch (Ha), I turn water to Cris’ (Ha),” said West, according to Genius.\n\nThroughout the album and song, West name drops many other people in the industry and situations he has faced. Although the incident with Swift initially happened in 2009, there have been many comments made by West over the years. In 2016, his song “Famous” mentioned Swift when he said “I feel like me and Taylor might still have sex / Why? I made that bitch famous.” Have you heard the new song yet? Here is the full song below.\n\nRandi Moultrie is a Charleston, South Carolina native and has been in the radio industry for the last few years in Charlotte. Randi started with Beasley Media Group as an intern in 2019 and is now thriving in the digital world. Randi enjoys writing about her favorite foods (especially pizza) and all things fashion and travel. As one who loves taking trips to find new foods, it’s not surprising that she enjoys writing about both!"
