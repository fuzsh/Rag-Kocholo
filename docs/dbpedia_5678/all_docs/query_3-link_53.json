        "text": "Since releasing his first official country single in 2021, âSon of a Sinnerâ, Jelly Roll has ripped up the rules and established himself as one of the most popular artists in the genre.\n\nAfter the reflective, spiritually inspired Whitsitt Chapel, which was championed by many as one of the albums of the year, Jelly is now hard at work on his keenly awaited follow-up.\n\nHe's so far been keeping the details of the project relatively close to his chest, but he did treat the Grand Ole Opry crowd to a live debut of an unreleased track, âLiarâ. Jelly then performed an evocative rendition of the track during the 2024 ACM Awards in May.\n\nThe stirring, anthemic track follows in a similarly motivational vein to fan-favourites such as âNeed A Favorâ, âNail Meâ and the Lainey Wilson-assisted âSave Meâ, with the Tennessee crooner once again reminding listeners of what truly matters in life.\n\nIn the uplifting, energising track, he rattles through some of the lies he's been told in his life, âSaying drink another whiskey / Pop another pill / Money makes you happy / Heaven isnât real / You wonât find nobody to love because your heartâs too brokeâ.\n\nThis is expected to be one of the first tracks to be made available from his upcoming album. However, Jelly did warn fans that the future of âLiarâ is yet to be decided, âI feel like this is a safe place to play a new song, is that okay with yâall? We might not ever release this song. Weâre just gonna play it for yâall and see if it worksâ.\n\nAlthough âLiarâs fate is up in the air, one thing that's certain is that Jelly Roll loves a collaboration, with the chart-topping artist releasing duets with Riley Green, Cody Johnson, ERNEST, Jessie Murph and many more over the past six months. With this in mind, we reckon Jelly's new project will feature some high-profile guests.\n\nJelly Roll spoke to Holler last year about how a collaboration with Morgan Wallen is âinevitableâ, so we're hoping these two country megastars get a chance to hit the studio before Jelly drops the album. Another big name Jelly has floated as a dream duet is Post Malone, with the duo having spent time together on a number of occasions of late - and we'd sure be surprised if the prospect of working together didn't come up. Although it is worth underlining that, with Posty currently readying his debut country album, a collaboration between the two would seemingly be more likely to feature on that project than Jelly's at this point.\n\nTowards the end of May, Jelly Roll debuted another new track, âI Am Not OKâ, and we're keeping our fingers crossed the powerful, quietly hopeful song makes it onto his new album.\n\nIn July 2023, Jelly Roll shared âDragging These Rootsâ as part of Apple Music's exclusive âLost & Foundâ song series. We'd love to see the fiery, uptempo track given a full release, and we're hoping Jelly keeps it in mind when compiling his next album's tracklist.\n\nFor more on Jelly Roll, see below:"
