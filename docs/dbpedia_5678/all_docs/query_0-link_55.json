        "text": "1990: God calls Pastor Hal and Lori Seed to plant a church in Southern California. According to Pastor Hal, “It was like God grabbed me by the collar and whispered, ‘If not you, who? If not now, when?’ God had been so good to me; how could I do any less than respond to His call? Even though it meant leaving behind a nice church in a nice city, with nice buildings, nice friends, and a nice salary to come to a place where we knew no one, to start a church that had no name, no people, no buildings, and no finances. We had to respond.”\n\n1991: Hal & Lori Seed and their two kids move from Colorado to California with two other couples to plant a brand new church in Oceanside.\n\nJanuary 9, 1992: Founding couples start meeting as a house group at the Seed home near Rancho Del Oro Road in Oceanside.\n\nMay, 1992: 14 Oceansiders commit to joining the launch team, and the name New Song Community Church is selected based on Psalm 40:3, “He put a new song in my mouth, a hymn of praise to our God. Many will see and fear and put their trust in the Lord.”\n\nSeptember 27, 1992: New Song Community Church starts meeting in a rented theater at Mira Costa College, and 194 people show up for the first service!\n\n1994: New Song plants its first daughter church, New Hope Community Church, in San Marcos, California.\n\nSeptember 10, 1995: New Song builds out and leases its first permanent space at 4065 Oceanside Blvd., seeing an average of 230 attendees each weekend.\n\nSummer, 1996: New Song adds second Sunday service as the church grows.\n\nSeptember, 1998: New Song adds Saturday night service.\n\nOctober, 1998: New Song plants its second daughter church, Rock Springs Community Church, in the Carrillo Ranch neighborhood of Carlsbad.\n\nFebruary, 1999: New Song plants its Spanish congregation, Iglesia Cristiana Emanuel.\n\nAugust 18, 2000: New Song purchases its first permanent property at 3895 Mission Avenue (Oceanside) and builds out the old lumber building to open its doors in April, 2001.\n\n2002: New Song launches its initiative to become “The Church Next Door,” partnering with Brother Benno’s, Solutions for Change, Bread of Life, Children by Choice, Stand Up for Kids, SOS, The Red Cross, and several other local community outreach programs.
