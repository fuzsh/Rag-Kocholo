        "text": "Sometimes, I feel like Spider-Man.\n\nNo, I cannot scale the side of buildings, or miraculously heal myself from wounds. But I do have a sense sometimes that something is wrong or about to happen before it actually does.\n\nI’ll tell a friend, “I have a bad feeling that this person is about to cancel on me.” I’ll be laying in bed and think, “I don’t think I locked all the doors in the house,” and I get up to discover that one of them is unlocked.\n\nIf you’ve ever felt that lack of peace and uneasiness, you know that God often works through that uneasiness in order to disturb us, unsettle us, and open us up to something new.\n\nOne of the feelings that you may have right now is the sense of “there has to be more,” or even “I was made for more than this.” I love what Vance Pittman says about those moments with God. “A lack of clarity is always a call to deeper intimacy.”\n\nJosh Baldwin recently released a new song about this kind of stirring entitled “Made for More.” In the chorus, Baldwin declares,\n\nRELATED CONTENT: Josh Baldwin Previews Upcoming Live Album With ‘Made For More’\n\n“So why would I make a bed in my shame\n\nWhen a fountain of grace is running my way\n\nI know I am Yours\n\nAnd I was made for more”\n\nWhen I think about this song and the reminder it gives us about who God says we are and our calling from Him, a number of scriptures come to mind.\n\nIn Ephesians 2, Paul writes about the gospel of grace - how we are saved by grace and none of us can boast about our status with Christ. In verse 10, he states, “For we are God’s masterpiece. He has created us anew in Christ Jesus, so we can do the good things he planned for us long ago.”\n\nEarlier in Ephesians 1, Paul declares his longing for the believers to comprehend how they were made for more. “I pray that your hearts will be flooded with light so that you can understand the confident hope he has given to those he called—his holy people who are his rich and glorious inheritance. I also pray that you will understand the incredible greatness of God’s power for us who believe him.”\n\nRELATED CONTENT: Music Video Premiere: \"Made For More\" Josh Baldwin feat. Jenn Johnson\n\nIn 1 Peter 2, Peter reminds us of our identity and purpose. “But you are not like that, for you are a chosen people. You are royal priests, a holy nation, God’s very own possession. As a result, you can show others the goodness of God, for he called you out of the darkness into his wonderful light.”\n\nOne of the most sobering places to visit is a graveyard. Todd Henry wrote, “The most valuable land in the world is the graveyard. In the graveyard are buried all of the unwritten novels, never-launched businesses, unreconciled relationships, and all of the other things that people thought, ‘I’ll get around to that tomorrow.’ One day, however, their tomorrows ran out.”\n\nWe often go through life missing out on what God has for us, leaving our potential untapped and calling ignored. I’ve seen how God uses hitting rock bottom to wake someone up to the whisper of God they’ve been ignoring. I’ve also seen God work as someone finds “success,” only to discover an emptiness that leads them to ask an important question of God. “Is there more?”\n\nRELATED CONTENT: Air1 Cover Story With Josh Baldwin\n\nJosh Baldwin found God speaking to him both in failure and success.\n\n“In the valleys, He was my help, my Prince of Peace, my Savior and Friend. In the highest moments, I was reminded how we are created in the image of God, and we were made for so much more than we imagine for ourselves.”\n\nSo, if you’re feeling like Spider-Man today, don’t ignore that sense of restlessness and uneasiness. If you’re wondering “was I made for more, Jesus?” the answer is YES!\n\nDon’t settle for merely gratifying the desires of your sinful flesh.\n\nDon’t settle for just following the pattern in the way of this world.\n\nDon’t settle for being popular or well liked.\n\nDon’t settle for pursuing wealth or accumulating possessions.\n\nDon’t settle when God has made you for more - much more!\n\nSeek God. Pursue deeper intimacy with God. Invite others to pray for you and with you. Go after all that God has for you.\n\nI’ll close here with the words Baldwin uses to open his song.\n\n“I know who I am ‘cause I know who You are\n\nThe cross of salvation was only the start\n\nNow I am chosen, free and forgiven\n\nI have a future and it’s worth the living”"
