        "text": "How do we describe Third Way when it comes to how we relate to one another?\n\nWe like to say it requires good table manners. Having good table manners is expressed whenever we choose to walk together in love and humility. We willingly give deference to others for the sake of love and we treat others as being better than ourselves. Jesus modeled this way for us. [1]\n\nIn practical terms:\n\nWe listen.\n\nWe show respect for one another’s point of view and honor their willingness to open up and share their story.\n\nWe’re vulnerable.\n\nWe’re honest as we allow ourselves to be seen and known.\n\nWe show empathy.\n\nWe are curious, not judgmental. We ask questions.\n\nWe might not agree at the end.\n\nAnd that’s ok. We can still be at the table together – “in essentials, unity; in non-essentials, liberty; in all things, charity.”\n\nDoes Third Way mean I need to change my beliefs to belong?\n\nEmbracing a Third Way posture does not require one to change their beliefs, but rather to challenge any negative attitudes towards those who do not share their beliefs.\n\nAt Newsong we desire to cultivate a community of people who love Jesus, and try to love each other despite our differences. We choose to love each other with a commitment to honor one another wherever we may be in our individual life journeys.\n\nIs Newsong an affirming church?\n\nWhen we say Newsong, it is not only the board, the pastors and the leaders, it is also those who call Newsong home. With this in mind, yes, in large part we are affirming, but still there are those who are not. Yet, we are a church who protects and affirms the participation of the LGBTQIA+ community in the full life of our church. We are fully committed to provide an environment of safety and love for all.\n\nIs Newsong a political church?\n\nYes, we are in the sense of the meaning of the world political which means we have meaningful conversations about the concerns of the city. We are not partisan.\n\nDo you support DACA, dreamers, refugees and the undocumented?\n\nYes, we believe each person is made in the image of God and as followers of Christ, we are called to love generously to those who don’t have access to human rights."
