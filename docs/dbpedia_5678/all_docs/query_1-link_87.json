        "text": "It's been just over five months since Lil Nas X released his Nas remix of \"Rodeo\", and earlier this week he gave an update on his highly-anticipated debut album, revealing it's \"almost finished but working on a mixtape too.\"\n\nHe also updated his Twitter bio, which now reads: \"ALBUM: 92% DONE\".\n\nYesterday (9 July), Lil Nas X shared a 38-second clip of him listening a new song of his in the car. He captioned the post \"Call Me By Your Name\", which is presumably the track title.\n\nThe \"Old Town Road\" hitmaker hasn't given many updates on his debut album. In September 2019, while speaking to Angie Martinez on her Power 105.1 show, Lil Nas X said, \"I wanna have at least 70 songs to choose from for making like the 10-15 track album.\"\n\nOn the potential sound of the LP, Lil Nas X added, \"I definitely want it to be, I guess more personal, but still like, slapping.\"\n\nThe singer/rapper's debut EP 7 was released just over a year ago.\n\nLil Nas X is yet to announce a release date for \"Call Me By Your Name\"."
