        "text": "Ghost have released a surprise new song, “The Future Is a Foreign Land,” which is part of their soundtrack to the group’s new movie, RITE HERE RITE NOW. The song is being called a “1969-era Ghost song” and is penned by Papa Nihil.\n\nGhost Release Surprise New Song\n\nThe movie RITE HERE RITE NOW started screening in cinemas around the world on Thursday (June 20). The movie will also have a limited theatrical release for the next week. A tally of participating theaters and showtimes are listed at the movie’s website. RITE HERE RITE NOW mixes a narrative story with concert footage, and it makes for a very unique offering. The full soundtrack will be available July 26, and it features features live performances recorded at the Kia Forum for the film. It’s pretty rare when you see a band put together a project like this one, so I have to give Ghost props.\n\nIn other Ghost news, the band doesn’t have any tour dates scheduled for 2024 as of now. But, don’t worry too much, because these guys aren’t going anywhere. It’s just a matter of time before they announce some live shows. But, Ghost are keeping busy, as on top of the movie, the band is currently working on a new album, which will mark their follow-up to 2022’s IMPERA.\n\nGhost frontman Tobias Forge recently spoke with Metal Hammer magazine about the rise of the band. He mentioned that there are a lot more kids at their shows these days. He also said that the last time Ghost played Detroit, they had an audience of 4,000 people. The last time they played the Motor City, that number was more than 10,000, which makes him happy. He also doesn’t have regrets. “Of course, if I could go back in time and curate everything, there would be a few things that I would have done differently,” he said. “But that has very little to do with my actual career.” The band described the new album as, “Whether you’re a devoted disciple looking to relive treasured memories of the GHOST live spectacle or among the curious uninitiated, RITE HERE RITE NOW and its companion soundtrack will put you right there: putting your phones down and living in the moment, as a shadow of uncertainty looms, completely spellbound and in the thrall of this bombastic yet intimate cinematic portrait of Ghost.” I’m here for it, Forge.\n\nListen to Ghost’s surprise new song “The Future Is a Foreign Land” below. I think it’s exciting when a band releases a surprise new song, and that’s happening more often lately.\n\nAnne Erickson started her radio career shortly after graduating from Michigan State University and has worked on-air in Detroit, Flint, Toledo, Lansing and beyond. As someone who absolutely loves rock, metal and alt music, she instantly fell in love with radio and hasn’t looked back. When she’s not working, Anne makes her own music with her band, Upon Wings, and she also loves cheering on her favorite Detroit and Michigan sports teams, especially Lions and MSU football. Anne is also an award-winning journalist, and her byline has run in a variety of national publications. You can also hear her weekends on WRIF."
