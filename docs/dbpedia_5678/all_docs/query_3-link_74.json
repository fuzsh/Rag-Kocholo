        "text": "Topline\n\nSome fans think Eminem dissed Megan Thee Stallion in his new song “Houdini,” pointing to a lyric that appears to reference her 2020 shooting by Tory Lanez, while fans defended the name-drop as typical for the rapper’s intentionally provocative alter-ego, Slim Shady.\n\nKey Facts\n\nKey Background\n\nIn 2022, Drake rapped in his song with 21 Savage, “Circo Loco,” that “this b— lie ‘bout getting shots, but she still a stallion”—which many interpreted to be a diss suggesting Megan Thee Stallion fabricated the shooting incident. She fired back on social media: “Since when tf is it cool to joke abt women getting shot!” She slammed Drake and other rappers for being ready to “dog pile on a black woman when she say one of y’all homeboys abused her.” In January, Megan Thee Stallion released “HISS,” perceived as a diss track against Drake, Nicki Minaj and more, slamming those who bring up her name for “twenty-four hours of attention.” After Minaj interpreted a line in “HISS” to be a diss at her husband, registered sex offender Kenneth Petty (“These hoes don’t be mad at Megan, these hoes mad at Megan’s Law”—a reference to the federal law requiring convicted sex offenders to be publicly disclosed), Minaj released a diss track titled “Big Foot,” with several lyrics suggesting the Lanez shooting was fabricated. In “Big Foot,” Minaj raps: “F— you get shot with no scar?” and “How you go on Gayle King and can't cry?” the latter referencing Megan Thee Stallion’s 2022 interview with journalist Gayle King about the shooting.\n\nChief Critics\n\nSome social media users and reviewers slammed Eminem’s song, particularly the Megan Thee Stallion lyric. “What exactly did this girl do to deserve this type of harassment by male rappers constantly? I mean genuinely what did she do?” one post on X, liked more than 100,000 times, states. Music publication Stereogum called the song “terrible” and criticized the lyrics, including the Lanez shooting reference, as “cluttered and unpleasant.” The New York Times music critics called Eminem “desperate to offend at every turn” with “stiltedly rapped jokes.” Music journalist Sowmya Krishnamurthy tweeted: “Eminem’s career has largely been built on being shocking and provocative to certain audiences … Being 51 years old and taking shots at Megan Thee Stallion? Out of touch.”\n\nContra\n\nEminem’s fans on social media noted he rapped in character as Slim Shady—his more angry and aggressive alter-ego—and claimed Eminem himself was not dissing Megan Thee Stallion. “Anyone who listens to hip hop already knows this ain’t a diss from Eminem, he’s known for taking funny jabs in bars at anyone,” one user posted on X. USA Today admitted the lyric was “mean,” but called it “clever,” noting Eminem is “famous for cutting down peers in his songs.”\n\nTangent\n\nSeveral rappers have garnered significant attention and chart success with diss tracks this year, starting with “HISS” and “Big Foot” in January. Both songs went viral, and “HISS” debuted at No. 1 on the Billboard Hot 100. In March, Kendrick Lamar kicked off what would become a weekslong and increasingly dramatic feud with Drake that saw the two drop a combined nine diss tracks between March and May. Lamar first threw jabs at Drake on “Like That,” slamming a prior lyric from J. Cole that said the three rappers made up the “big three” of rap, with Lamar instead stating it’s “just big me.” “Like That” topped the Hot 100 for three weeks. Over the next several weeks, Drake and Lamar traded wild accusations through diss tracks: Lamar accused Drake of being a “predator” attracted to minors and having a secret daughter (both of which he denied), while Drake accused Lamar of abusing his wife. At the peak of the feud, Drake and Lamar ranked No. 2 and No. 3, respectively, on the Spotify daily artists charts, and Lamar’s diss “Not Like Us” topped the Hot 100.\n\nFurther Reading\n\nEminem Attempts to Make His Career Disappear With New Song ‘Houdini’ (Rolling Stone)\n\nDrake-Kendrick Lamar Feud Timeline: Drake Raps Over Metro Boomin’s ‘BBL Drizzy’ Beat On Sexyy Red Song (Forbes)"
