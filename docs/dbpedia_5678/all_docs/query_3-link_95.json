        "text": "Boris have unveiled the new song and video “My Name Is Blank,” the latest single from their forthcoming album Heavy Rocks (2022), arriving August 12th.\n\nThe new song utterly rips, falling somewhere between hardcore and Motörhead-style pedal-to-the-floor hard rock. It’s a fun one that should go over well in the live setting, as evidenced by the performance music video.\n\nThe track is also a great example of what makes Boris’ Heavy Rocks album series so great. Here’s a band known for their drone and experimental releases, completely unleashed and in pure rock ‘n’ roll mode. The new record will be the third Heavy Rocks LP, with the previous two having dropped in 2002 and 2011.\n\nRelated Video\n\n“The soul of rock music is constantly evolving,” the band said in the initial album press release. “A soul that transcends words and meaning to reach you – instinct, intuition, and fangs.This is the heavy rock of Boris now. As we land on our 30th anniversary, Boris continues to evolve, accelerating the latest and universal. Boris does not lead anyone anywhere. We just keep showing this attitude.”\n\nBoris will be supporting the new Heavy Rocks (2022) LP with a late summer / early fall North American tour featuring support from Nothing. Both bands will play Psycho Vegas (August 19th-21st) before embarking on the proper outing. Headlining dates kick off August 22nd in Albuquerque, New Mexico, and run through September 24th in Mexico City. Get tickets via Ticketmaster."
