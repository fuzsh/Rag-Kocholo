        "text": "In 2017 Aaron Watson’s Vaquero brought in the biggest career sales for a debut Honky Tonk Kid album to date -- peaking at No. 2 on the Top Country Albums chart.\n\nThe album was the follow up to his 2015 album, The Underdog. That one debuted at No. 1 on the Billboard Top Country Albums chart, which made him the first-ever independent, male country artist to debut in the coveted top spot.\n\nHis 2019 album Red Bandana opened at No. 2 on Billboard's Country Album Sales chart with nearly 10,000 units sold, and more than 2 Million first week streams. To say the project is an epic is not an overstatement. The 20-song collection was written solely by The Honky Tonk Kid himself, and features a marathon of great country music.\n\nToday, Watson released a brand new song - yes, another new song less than a year after dropping twenty new ones on us, dude is a machine - \"Whisper My Name\" is everywhere now. Give it a listen up top."
