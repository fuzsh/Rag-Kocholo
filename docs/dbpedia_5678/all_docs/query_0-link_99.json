        "text": "We believe Jesus called us not just to be believers, but disciples of Him. And the primary way he commands us to do this is by following Him, and helping others do the same.\n\nWe are a church of ministers. No matter where we work, live, attend school, or interact with others, we are ministers there. We all have a role in leading others to Jesus.\n\nServing others is the best way to build relationships. We do this through our We Care ministry and walking alongside community and church members through their times of need.\n\nWe'd love to have you join us each Sunday for Sunday school and worship. Our Sunday schools consist of middle school, high school, and adult groups, as well as seasonal Women's Bible Study and other adult options throughout the year. Then join us in the sanctuary for coffee and snacks until worship starts at 10:30am. We can't wait to see you!\n\nJoin us as we take time each week to pray for the community, the country and world issues, our congregation, spiritual growth and to give thanks to the Lord for all He has done. This is a time to grow in our prayer life and relationships with one another, reorienting our lives to the Lord and watching Him work in the situations we are praying for."
