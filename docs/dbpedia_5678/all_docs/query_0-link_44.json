        "text": "Do We Need a New Song?\n\nI've often heard music playing in the background at restaurants, doctor's offices, and some stores. It used to be called Muzak, a mix of pop songs dressed up like an orchestra playing classical music. It was typically bland and monotonous.\n\nI’ve also noticed the background music in a store usually fits the target demographic of that store. Most songs, regardless of the genre (pop, country, hip-hop, etc.) focus on romantic love, its highs and lows. The style of music changes over the years, but the content remains the same.\n\nThere are many popular Christian music stations playing \"family-friendly\" music. For me, it can sound the same way as the background music in stores. Why? Because it seems to be the same songs played over and over and with similar content and styles.\n\nI believe Christian worship music ought to be primarily God-centered, but over the past decade or two, more songs seem to be centered on the worshiper themselves. I understand the value of personalizing songs, but when songs are more self-centric than God-centric, the songs become more about us than the Lord.\n\nEach generation brings variations of style. Younger generations have different ways to express music than older generations. This generational clash is not new. The music my wife and I listened to and sang in worship ushered in what became known as contemporary worship. Older generations steeped in tradition condemned it.\n\nNow, what seemed “cutting edge” fifty years ago sounds pretty tame compared to what is common in Christian music and worship songs today. What was new then sounds old now, and on it will go until we sing with an angelic choir in heaven someday.\n\nBut what makes a new song new? Do we even need new songs? Apparently, those who wrote the Psalms thought so! But what did they mean by “sing a new song to the Lord?”\n\nI don’t think it's the style or the content, as we might think of it. But when a song is fresh and new in us, in our hearts and minds, it becomes new. Even older songs can seem new to us because they're fresh or renewed for us. Keep this in mind as you read through Psalm 96.\n\nScripture\n\nSing to the Lord a new song! Sing to the Lord, all the earth! Sing to the Lord! Praise his name!\n\nDay after day announce that the Lord saves his people. Tell people about his glory. Tell all the nations about his miracles.\n\nThe Lord is great! He should be highly praised.\n\nHe should be feared more than all other gods because all the gods of the nations are idols. The Lord made the heavens. [vss 1-5]\n\nSplendor and majesty are in his presence. Strength and beauty are in his holy place.\n\nGive to the Lord, you families of the nations. Give to the Lord glory and power. Give to the Lord the glory he deserves.\n\nBring an offering, and come into his courtyards.\n\nWorship the Lord in his holy splendor. Tremble in his presence, all the earth! [vss 6-9]\n\nSay to the nations, “The Lord rules as king!” The earth stands firm; it cannot be moved. He will judge people fairly.\n\nLet the heavens rejoice and the earth be glad. Let the sea and everything in it roar like thunder. Let the fields and everything in them rejoice.\n\nThen all the trees in the forest will sing joyfully in the Lord’s presence because he is coming.\n\nHe is coming to judge the earth.\n\nHe will judge the world with righteousness and its people with his truth. [vss 10-13]\n\n(Psalm 96:1-13 GW) [Context– Psalm 96]\n\nReflections and Insights\n\nReading through the Psalms, we see a lot of repetition of words and thoughts. This repetition is a critical element of all poetic styles of writing, including songs. It makes them memorable. But what makes a new song new is the way it’s expressed and when it’s sung.\n\nSinging a song of joy in a time of darkness is singing a new song. A song of prayer and meditation in the midst of chaotic times can also be a new song. These songs can be the offerings of our hearts when we enter His presence in prayer or worship.\n\nHave you experienced an older song becoming fresh and new in your heart? Do you ever sing for joy in difficult or dark times? Lift your heart and voice to the Lord in praise and worship in a fresh way. It may seem the earth and the world join in around you!\n\nThe Psalms are remarkable as a whole within all 150 of the Psalms collected into its five books. They express an array of emotions and thoughts spanning much of Israel’s history. And yet, they are as relevant now as when written and throughout the centuries since then.\n\nFocusing our hearts and minds on the Lord helps us have a heavenly perspective. This helps us escape the churning chaos or darkness of the world or within our circumstances. And being heavenly-minded makes life on earth better for us.\n\nReflection—\n\nHave you experienced an older song becoming fresh and new in your heart? Do you ever sing for joy in difficult or dark times? Lift your heart and voice to the Lord in praise and worship in a fresh way.\n\nPrayer Focus—\n\nIf or when you find the darkness of life closing in around you, ask the Lord to put a new song in your heart. Ask for His guidance while reading through the Psalms or anywhere in the Scriptures. Ask the Lord to help you set your heart and mind on heavenly things."
