        "text": "In Old Testament scriptures, the name Jehovah is also compounded with other names, giving us beautiful pictures of God's nature and character. He is called, Jehovah Elohim meaning, “Jehovah God,&rdquo; Jehovah Rapha meaning “Jehovah or God our healer,&rdquo; Jehovah Shalom meaning “Jehovah or God our peace,&rdquo; Jehovah Ra-ah meaning “Jehovah or God our shepherd, Jehovah Shammah meaning “Jehovah or God, the one present\".\n\n“Abba Father&rdquo; is not one that is just to exclaim in praise or recognition, such as with heavenly Father or Father God. Abba Father, as conveyed throughout scriptures reflects the knowledge of knowing that God knows us better than we know ourselves. Simplified chord charts, lead sheets, and sheet music for piano and vocals are available for small groups to large congregations.\n\nWhen we call God immutable, we are saying that He is not subject to mutation; that is, He does not change. Likewise, in defining our Father as infinite, we are saying that He is not finite. To be infinite means God's being and greatness have no limitations. Download chord charts, lead sheets, orchestrations, and audio tracks of songs and hymns on the theme of purpose.\n\nTo experience God's favor is to understand the practicality of His blessings. We are undeserving, and yet He continues to bestow promises over our lives that prompt us to do His will. He is a God of mercy, and His favor is feasible because He calls us worthy of more. Here is a list of songs focusing on the promise of His favor.\n\nDo not be ashamed of the testimony of our Lord or of me His prisoner, but join with me in suffering for the gospel according to the power of God, who has saved us and called us&hellip;according to His own purpose. 2 Timothy 1:8-9. Today, remember that God has a special calling just for you, a plan for your life. Surrender to Him. Trust Him. Serve Him. Download chord charts, choir sheets, lead sheets, and more on the theme of calling."
