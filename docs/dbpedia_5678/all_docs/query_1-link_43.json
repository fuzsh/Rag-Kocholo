For instructions, see Create a Smart Playlist.\n\nIdentify an item that you imported from a CD as an audiobook, so it appears below Audiobooks instead of Music (click Options, then choose Audiobook from the Media Kind pop-up menu). If you do this, iTunes also remembers your place in the audiobook."
