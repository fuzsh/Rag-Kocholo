        "text": "Ariana Grande‘s new music is officially coming any day now, and fans think they may have even figured out the title.\n\nAlthough they aren’t sure whether it’s the name of her recently confirmed seventh album, a song from the album, or both, Arianators are certain that “Yes, And?” is going to be a very important phrase in the 30-year-old pop star’s discography very soon. The theory starts with a custom sweatshirt Grande wore this week with the two-word question printed on the front, which she paired with jeans, black loafers, a brown tote purse and red nails.\n\nAfter photos of the outfit hit social media, someone very close to Grande seemed to subtly confirm that the sweatshirt was exactly what fans thought it was. The R.E.M. Beauty founder’s mother Joan liked a picture of her daughter wearing the sweatshirt that a fan on Twitter had captioned, “ariana grande teasing her comeback single ‘yes, and?'”\n\nBut there’s more. Last week, Ari posted a muted clip of Joan jamming out to one of the album’s unreleased songs on Instagram. And although you can’t hear the music, lip-reading fans say that Mama Grande was definitely singing along to the words “yes and.”\n\n“I KNOW SHE WAS DANCING TO YES, AND?” one fan tweeted, sharing the clip of Joan.\n\nJust days before the new year, the “Thank U, Next” singer confirmed that her new album will drop at some point in 2024 — and it definitely seems to be coming sooner rather than later. The star has also been sharing a number of pictures and mostly muted videos from her recent time in the studio, as well as a blurry image of her own red lips that fans think may be the project’s cover.\n\nGrande’s expected return to music comes after a years long break during which she openly chose to focus on her makeup business and her role in the upcoming live action adaptations of the Broadway musical Wicked, in which she’ll play Glinda opposite Cynthia Erivo’s Elphaba. She hasn’t had a proper release since 2020’s Positions, which debuted atop the Billboard 200 and spawned a Billboard Hot 100 No. 1 single with its title track.\n\nSee how Arianators are reacting to the “Yes, And?” theory below."
