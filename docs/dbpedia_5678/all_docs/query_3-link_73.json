        "text": "Here’s a new song that we are going to learn this weekend at New City Fellowship.\n\nThis song was co-written by Israel Houghton and Darlene Zschech. It’s the single from Israel’s latest recording, “Alive in Asia” but Zschech seems to have released it earlier with a more HIllsong-y rock vibe.\n\nWhat I love about this song:\n\nInfectious groove and ear-wormish melody\n\nBold proclamation of God’s commitment to his people and his kingdom (Romans 8)\n\nStuff that I’m not going to worry about:\n\nmaintaining Houghton’s EDM pop vibe on the recording (because we’re just not that kind of band)\n\nmaintaining the recording’s unison only vocals (my people harmonize even when I tell them not to)\n\nperforming all 6 1/2 minutes from the recording\n\nI went through a period of doing a TON of Houghton’s music. It’s always fun and for the most part, theologically solid despite his connection to Joel Osteen. For me, his songs have been the bridge between CCM style worship and contemporary gospel which is exactly what a multicultural evangelical church needs. If you haven’t incorporated these yet, you should check out his other songs like:\n\nYou are Good\n\nFriend of God\n\nAgain I Say Rejoice\n\nThere’s a Lifting of the Hands\n\nJesus At The Center\n\nSaved By Grace\n\nWho Is Like The Lord\n\nHighly Exalted\n\nMoving Forward\n\nDeeper\n\nStuff to remember when attempting Houghton’s songs with a congregation:"
