We are committed to pursuing this faith in the context of community. We engage in the CAUSE by participating in the work of God in our world together through local and global engagement in mission and social justice.\n\nWe affirm six foundational affirmations of the Christian faith:\n\nThe centrality of the word of God\n\nThe necessity of new birth\n\nA commitment to the whole mission of the Church\n\nThe church as a fellowship of believers\n\nThe conscious dependance on the Holy Spirit\n\nThe reality of freedom in Christ\n\nAlthough we are a contemporary church, we also affirm a historic faith, expressed most simply in the Apostles Creed.
