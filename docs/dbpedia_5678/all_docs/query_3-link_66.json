        "text": "Joshua Bassett is back with new music!\n\nThe 23-year-old actor and musician just debuted his brand new single “The Golden Years,” where he sings about his late teens and early 20s when he was on High School Musical: The Musical: The Series.\n\nHe also just announced his long-awaited debut album The Golden Years.\n\nKeep reading to listen and learn more…\n\n“Encapsulating the bitter-sweet nostalgia of my late teens and early twenties, my debut album is a love-letter to ‘the golden years’ of my life thus far,” Joshua shared in a statement. “This body of work spans the hope and heartbreak of my transition into adulthood. It’s a genre-bending journal entry from the bottom of my heart.”\n\nThis is Joshua‘s first new song since “Just Love” back in September 2023. Fans may also recall hearing “The Golden Years” on his last tour.\n\nCheck out the new song right here and you can pre-save the album HERE!"
