Now in its twenty-second year

NewSong Music is an Independent Artist Development Organization & Independent Record Label

Our goal is to identify the truly exceptional artists and to work closely with them to develop their careers and introduce their music to a broader, international audience, and to build a supportive community of performers and songwriters across all genres of music

Our independent and award winning record label, NewSong Recordings, was established in 2006 to work hand in hand with truly exceptional talent that we identify within our community of artists.

The NewSong Music Performance & Songwriting Competition is one of North Americaâ€™s premier showcases of emerging performers and songwriters across an array of genres. The 2023 NewSong Music Prize will begin accepting submissions in the spring of 2023; sign up for our newsletter and follow us on social media to be among the first to know when entries open!
