NewSong Church came into being in June of 1986 after founding pastor Dieter Zander encountered a vision from God to start a church primarily for those known as Generation X (people born between the years 1965 and 1983) and their families. Dieter believed this generation, confronting a broken and fragmented world, had a strong desire to make the world different for their families, friends, and for themselves.

The church was founded believing—in agreement with the historic, Christian faith—that the catalyst for ultimate change is found in the person and work of the Savior, Jesus Christ. NewSong’s mission was and still is to make fully devoted followers of Jesus Christ—followers who reflect the character and mission of Christ while impacting today’s world on His behalf.

NewSong takes its name and mission from Psalm 40:1–3:

“I waited patiently for the LORD; he turned to me and heard my cry. He lifted me out of the slimy pit, out of the mud and mire; he set my feet on a rock and gave me a firm place to stand. He put a new song in my mouth, a hymn of praise to our God. Many will see and fear and put their trust in the LORD.”

NewSong’s journey started in an apartment in Upland. As the church grew, NewSong moved to Sierra Vista Elementary School in Upland, then Cal Poly University in Pomona, Mt. San Antonio College in Walnut, Royal Oak Intermediate School in Covina, and finally, in November 2000, to its permanent home at 945 West Covina Boulevard in San Dimas.

In the early years, NewSong was mainly made up of college students and young singles. Today, NewSong is a multi-generational gathering of people, still aiming to develop fully-devoted followers of Christ who know how to FOLLOW Jesus, LOVE people and DO good.

NewSong remains committed to reaching those who’ve never been to church, those who have been hurt by the church, and those who don’t like church.

NewSong is led by a new lead pastor, Grant Myles-Era, a team of elders, pastoral staff, and dedicated leaders from within the church.

Looking ahead, the Lord continues to write our story and shape our community using people just like you.
