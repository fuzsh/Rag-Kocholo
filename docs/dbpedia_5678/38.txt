History

Throughout the years, and changes in the group, they have had 17 #1 singles, six Dove Award nominations, numerous songwriting awards, and five of the Top 100 Christian radio singles of the past decade. They are known for their songs, "Arise, My Love," "Miracles," "Jesus To The World (Roaring Lambs), and "The Christmas Shoes," which was also the title of their first Christmas Album.

With such success, it would have been easy to bask in the glow of the spotlight. "But it really wasn't about us," says Eddie Carswell. "It was pretty amazing to see how God orchestrated it all, and it took us completely by surprise.

Billy Goodman explains the group's faith attitude, "The commitment that we made was, 'God, we'll do this as long as Your hand is on it, as long as we see You working.'" He went on to say "God is faithful even when things look impossible."

Besides having a touring ministry they have also started their Jam event tours where many top name Christian Artists come together for evening concerts at a price that is affordable.

"I think what keeps us going is not necessarily the fun we have with the music, but it's that time at the end of the evening when we see people respond," Goodwin explains. "It's like a shot of adrenaline. It's amazing to see God use what little bit we're doing to reach people. That's really our motivation."

"We still love what we're doing and it's always incredible to hear how God has used our music to touch someone's life," Carswell concludes. "God's the one orchestrating this whole thing, and he's blessed us more and more as the years have gone by. It's a remarkable thing to see how it all works out, and we'll just keep riding the waves to see what God wants to do next."
