Champaign, Ill. - Illinois sophomore James Lepp will not be with his teammates this weekend when the Illini men's golf team opens the fall season at the Wisconsin Badger Invitational. Instead, Lepp will be playing alongside some of the world's top golfers in the Bell Canadian Open, which begins Thursday, Sept. 5 and concludes Sunday, Sept. 8. The Bell Canadian Open is a PGA Tour event that will be held at the Angus Glen Golf Club South Course in Markham, Ontario.

Lepp was given an exemption by the Royal Canadian Golf Association (RCGA) to participate in the Canadian Open, where he will compete as an amateur. Lepp is the two-time Canadian Junior National Champion and was named an honorable mention All-American and unanimous Big Ten Freshman of the Year after a stellar first campaign with the Illini last season.
