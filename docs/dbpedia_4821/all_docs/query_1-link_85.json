        "text": "Top 10 Trio Carries Razorbacks: Arkansas had three finishers in the top 10 to win its record 10th team title November 22 at Indiana. The Razorbacks scored 58 points for a runaway 127-point victory over Wisconsin. It was the widest winning margin in the championship, exceeding the Razorbacks&#39; 122-point triumph over Brigham Young in 1993. Michael Power, who did not finish the 1998 championships race, led the Razorbacks with his second-place time of 30:09.6 for 10,000 meters. Teammates Andrew Begley and James Karanu ended up seventh and 10th, respectively. Murray Link finished 22nd and Matt Kerr 24th to round out the Razorbacks&#39; scoring. Kimani pulled away from his pursuers after about 8 kilometers. His winning time of 30:06.6 was an Indiana course record."
