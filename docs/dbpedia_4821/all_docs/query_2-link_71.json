        "text": "Oct. 24, 2002\n\nEL PASO, Texas - UNLV men's golf star Ryan Moore was one of 24 collegiate players selected to play in the 28th Annual Western Refining College All-America Golf Classic, the Sun Bowl Association announced Thursday.\n\nThe All-America Golf Classic, slated for Nov. 25-26 at the El Paso Country Club (Par 71, 6,781 Yards), has been hosted by the Sun Bowl Association since 1974. The 54-hole event features two rounds of play on Monday, Nov. 25, and the final 18 holes will be played on Tuesday, Nov. 26. Invitations were extended to the top 24 players that earned All-America status last season, as chosen by the Golf Coaches Association of America, and the tournament carries a special exempt status that does not require it to count against the maximum number of competition days allowed by the NCAA.\n\nOne of just two sophomores in the 24-player field, Moore qualified for his invitation after earning honorable mention All-America honors last season. As a freshman, the Puyallup, Wash., native tied for eighth at the NCAA Championship. He followed the collegiate season with an impressive summer that included participation at the U.S. Open, a victory at the U.S. Amateur Public Links, and a quarterfinal appearance at the U.S. Amateur.\n\nMoore looks to become the third Rebel to win the event. Chris Riley topped the field in 1993 and Jeremy Anderson captured the title five years later.\n\nWith Moore's selection, the Sun Bowl Association awards a $1,000 scholarship to the UNLV men's golf program."
