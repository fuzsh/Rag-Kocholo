        "text": "Mike Small was alone with his thoughts on the familiar, monotonous drive south on Interstate 57 on Thursday. As a former professional golfer and arguably the best college golf coach in the country, Small knows that can be a dangerous place, especially after a rough day on the course.\n\nSo the Illinois men's golf coach was happy to take a phone call and chat about his frustrations with his play earlier that day, as if saying those thoughts out loud provided a release and also a bit of perspective.\n\nAs a No. 2 seed in the Illinois PGA Match Play at Elgin, Small was upset by No. 15 seed Andy Mickelson in the third round by a score of 3 and 2 (three down with two holes left).\n\n“I got beat today. I played absolutely horrible,” Small told Illini Inquirer. “I hit it in the wrong spots, and I got beat. I’m still, well, I’m still a little upset about it. Sitting here talking to you is making me feel better.”\n\nSmall, a former PGA TOUR cardholder, usually plays plenty of golf during the summers, either at Illinois PGA Section events or on the PGA TOUR Champions circuit, formerly the Senior PGA Tour. But with the pandemic shutting down many professional events and all in-person college recruiting opportunities, Small during his extra free time has hit the local courses more than any recent summer.\n\nSmall also has competed in nine IPGA events, accruing a stroke average of 69.14 over 14 rounds. Of eight stroke-play events, he has two first-place finishes, three second-place finishes, one third-place finish and two other top-10 finishes.\n\nSmall, 54, continued his strong play earlier this week. After a bye in the first round of IPGA Match Play, he defeated Brett McClellan 6 and 5 (six up with five holes remaining). But he wasn’t as sharp during Thursday’s loss to Mickelson. Small birdied the first hole but wouldn’t birdie another, carding three bogeys in the loss.\n\n“I took the game for granted a little bit because I had been playing pretty well,” Small said. \"I was on the wrong side of the hole, and I never could be aggressive. It was undisciplined golf. I played undisciplined golf today, and it just goes to show you that on any one day anything can happen. I just kind of came out and wasn’t tuned in, and I’m coming home now.”\n\nAs a competitor, Small was upset after the round. But as a coach, a part of Small knew this shortcoming could be used as a positive. This is the balance he’s found the last two decades as one of the few college coaches who competes at a high professional level.\n\nCoaching makes him a better player. Small this summer won his 13th Illinois PGA Championship, and in 2018, he qualified for the PGA TOUR Champions Cup Playoffs.\n\nAnd playing makes him a better coach. Small has led Illinois to 10 of the last 11 Big Ten Championships, and his Illini have made 12-straight appearances in the NCAA Championships.\n\nOn Thursday, Small planned to use his personal setback to teach his own players how to avoid similar setbacks.\n\n“I felt good and then today though, I didn't stay on point. I wasn't disciplined and I got beat, and I beat myself and that's the way it goes,” Small said. “So I learned my lesson, and I'm gonna tell them that.”\n\n'Share in the journey'\n\nWhen Small was hired to take over the Illini men's golf program he once played for, he knew he was taking over a rather ordinary Midwest program. Small was on the only Illini men’s golf team to win a Big Ten Championship (1988) since the start of World War II. After Small’s Illini teammate Steve Stricker won First-Team All-American in 1988 and 1989 before moving onto a very long and successful professional career, Illinois hire had produced just one All-American (D.A. Points, 1999) during the previous 12 years before Small's hire. And at that time, the Illini weren’t going to win over recruits with their facilities.\n\nSo Small knew he had to sell himself to prospects as a fellow competitor, someone who puts in the same grind on the course and goes through the same mental and physical struggles to master one of the world's most frustrating games. Then-Illinois athletic director Ron Guenther only encouraged Small to continue his professional career to help him build the program.\n\n“There wasn't a lot 20 years ago or 10 or 15 years ago to attract golfers to Champaign that was a different than anywhere else in the Big Ten or at least wasn't even up to par with the national programs,” Small said. “So this was kind of a different niche. Players want to come study the game and play the game and live with the coach in the game where I'm going out, competing and being nervous and fighting expectations and trying to be accountable to myself and my preparation. When I do that, they kind of get a kick out of that. The ones that want to do that come and want to share in the journey, and that's what has been a niche of ours, a recruiting niche, and I think they appreciate that.”\n\nSmall didn’t turn around the Illini program overnight — though he led Illinois to NCAA Championship appearances in 2002 and 2003, led by All-Americans James Lepp and Patrick Nagle. But as Small’s own golf game progressed, so did his program.\n\nSmall won four Illinois Open championships from 2003-2007. He was the three-time PGA Professional National Champion (2005, 2009, 2010) and a two-time runner-up (2004, 2007). He participated in nine PGA Championships, making three cuts (2005, 2007 and 2011). His professional career highlight may have come at the 2007 PGA Championship when he won the low club professional and shared the award stand on national television with Tiger Woods.\n\nBy the late 2000s, he also was leading the Illini program to its breakthrough. Behind Scott Langley, Luke Guthrie and Chris DeForest, the Illini ended a 21-year Big Ten title drought in 2009, the first of five straight conference crowns.\n\nSmall’s development of Langley — the 2010 NCAA champion — and Guthrie, the 2012 Big Ten Player of the Year, helped lure even more highly touted recruits, including Thomas Pieters (the 2012 NCAA Champion), Brian Campbell, Charlie Danielson, Thomas Detry, Dylan Meyer, Nick Hardy and Michael Feagles.\n\nThe Illini have fallen just short of a national championship but earned NCAA runner-up in 2013 and made match play (top-eight) at the NCAA Championships in six of seven years from 2011-17. During the last two decades, Small has built Illinois from a nondescript Big Ten program — with the disadvantages of the Midwest’s harsh winter climate — into the dominant Big Ten force and a true yearly national contender.\n\nSmall thinks he couldn’t have done that — as a developer and recruiter of talent — without continuing his own professional career.\n\n“I play because it's fun. I play because it's who I am as a competitor, and I want to see how my game can grow,” Small said. “But it also helps me and helps my coaching. It really does. If I put myself in situations that I want my players to be in, and I can get reacquainted with my emotions and how I handle those, it's better for me to be able to equate to what the guys are going through.\n\n“I think they appreciate that I can relate to them. There's a tighter communication. There’s an unspoken understanding that I'm going through what they're going through and the respect is there.”\n\n'I wish I knew then what I know now'\n\nAfter graduating from Illinois in 1988, Mike Small had a professional career most weekend warriors would consider a smashing success. He spent the decade before his coaching career exclusively playing professionally. He gradually worked his way up the ranks, spending five years on the PGA Tour and what is now known as the Korn Ferry Tour.\n\nBut Small struggled to stay at the top level, battling mental and emotional blocks as well as inconsistencies with his approach to the game, including course management and pre-round preparation.\n\n“I got really frustrated my last couple years of playing professionally,” Small said. “I didn’t really know how to decompress. I didn’t really know how to subdue myself.”\n\nSo what would Coach Small have told in-his-physical-prime Small?\n\n“That could be a whole 'nother hour right there,” Small said with a laugh. “A lot of stuff. The old saying is, ‘I wish I knew then what I know now.’”\n\nSmall uses his previous (and current) personal professional struggles to help his players attack those issues in their prime. So far, he’s had great success. He's coached two national individual champions (Langley and Pieters) and nine consecutive Big Ten individual champions (Guthrie x2, Pieters, Danielson, Hardy x2, Detry, Meyer and Adrien Dumont de Chassart). Many of those champions have gone onto professional success.\n\nRegulars on the European Tour, Pieters (77) and Detry (80) are top-80 in the Official World Golf Rankings. Detry and Pieters both entered Sunday's final round of the U.S. Open in the top-30 of the leaderboard.\n\nFour Illini currently are playing on the Korn Ferry Tour (current points list rankings): Hardy (17), Langley (120), Guthrie (141) and Campbell (144). Edoardo Lipparelli (No. 543 OWGR) plays on the European Tour, and Meyer (No. 1643 OWGR) played 31 events between 2018-19. Several current Illini, including Feagles, Dumont de Chassart and Jerry Ji could join the highest professional ranks soon, a freshman Piercen Hunt was the latest top-25 prospect to come to Champaign for Small's guidance.\n\n“I was good enough to play up there [on the PGA Tour], but I wasn't good enough to stay,” Small said. “I want my guys to be good enough to do that. I think that’s why they’ve all been pretty prepared at 21 when they go out. Professional golf careers ebb and flow, and it’s hard to sustain it for 20 years. But I think most of our guys will tell you that they’ve been really at their peak and really been mentally ready and prepared for the rigors of professional golf at 21 or 22 years old. I think that goes back to the way that we prepare to practice that I wished I had done 25 years ago.”\n\nBut Small also thinks his own game has improved due to the perspective he receives as a coach. He teaches his players how to apply mental and physical strategies to tweak their game, so he better understands how to use those techniques for himself.\n\n\"I wasn’t good enough to stay out there [on tour] because of the stuff that I learned later and I learned when I grew up,\" Small said. \"When I started coaching, I played better because I saw it from a different angle, I saw it from a different perspective. Some of the big things that I coach my guys about are the things that I did not do well that I wish I would have been taught to do better.”\n\n'Why do I do it?'\n\nMike Small seems at war with himself about the game to which he’s devoted his life. He’s really great at the game, and he’s even better at teaching it. He gets great joy out of playing well and even more joy from watching his Illini players overcome challenges, succeed in college and move on to money-making careers.\n\nBut Small admits the game — a constant battle of the mind — can also make him miserable when things aren’t going so well. And the more success he has, the more he seems to struggle with on-course struggles.\n\n“I've created expectations for myself, that I that make it harder and make it really sometimes unpleasant to play if I dwell on those expectations,” Small said. “It’s been hard.”\n\nSmall also said that with each passing year, he needs more time to prep his body for competition.\n\n“Part of me asks, ‘Why do I do it?’ because it takes a lot more work than ever,\" Small said.\n\nSome close to Small told him years ago that if his professional playing caused him so much stress that he should scale back and just enjoy what he built at Illinois. He took that advice — only to find him himself more frustrated. The game wasn't as enjoyable to him without the competitive fire.\n\n“I’ve trained myself for so long to think about the next one and forget about the past, that I never did that. When I finally did it … I didn’t play very well,” Small said. “I got kind of soft and kind of thinking about the past.\n\n“It’s something that I keep reminding myself, ‘This is what I do.’ I’m a competitive person. I’m a competitive coach. I don’t know if I could play golf just for the fun, just for the social benefit of it. I think all competitive players … you play golf for the reward of doing something that’s hard and getting past your deficiencies and improving than you do just for the enjoyment of it. You love doing it, don’t get me wrong, but it’s the reward of it.”\n\nSmall may brood about the losses, but he still gets a dopamine boost each time he meets his standard, whether that’s when he helped Illinois win its 10th Big Ten title in 11 years in 2019 or when he won his 13th PGA Professional Championship last month at Medinah Country Club, his first title in the event since 2016.\n\n“To come out and win that event was such a reward to me,” Small said “It offset all the frustration and the bad days I have because I got over some mental stuff and some emotional blocks that I had formed. That makes it all worthwhile personally to get over that. The money is nice. The recognition, the tweets and messages people send you are all nice, the affirmation of winning and having success. But getting past your own problems is a big deal, and that’s why we play this game I think really when you get down to it is it’s doing something that’s hard and getting self-satisfaction out of it.”\n\n'Just enough to keep me going'\n\nThere’s a theory/idea out there that Small will retire as Illini coach once he leads Illinois to a national championship so that he can then focus on a TOUR Champions career. He says that’s not the case because it assumes he feels unfulfilled in his coaching career without a title.\n\n“Is that the reason why I coach? No, it's not the reason why I coach,” Small said. “I just do it because I enjoy doing it. I enjoy the challenges of it every week and every day, and I enjoy being at the University of Illinois where I'm from and people associate me with that. And if we're to win that championship, I would not quit. I'm gonna hang up coaching when I don't do it for why I do it now.”\n\nSmall loves the process: attacking challenges in his game and his players’ games, overcoming obstacles (both self-imposed and outwardly-imposed) and finding success. So he struggled early in the pandemic when that process screeched to a halt. Most of his players returned home in March and didn’t return to campus until late last month. Most PGA TOUR Champions events were canceled this spring and summer, and Small also thought it more responsible to stay inside the state borders during the pandemic.\n\nBut after a few hours of what Illini golf work he could accomplish each day, he invested more time into his own game. He needed to scratch that competitive itch. That started a run of relative dominance at IPGA events.\n\n“I won a couple times this summer, and I got those juices flowing again,” Small said. “Even though the events weren't as big as some of the ones I played in nationally before, it’s still competitiveness, and I needed that. I needed that for myself, my own sanity, but I also need it for coaching. I can't go watch players. I couldn't work with my players. I couldn't do anything. So this is the next best thing was just to live the game again and to go compete.”\n\nAt times, Small may sound stretched thin, like he may sometimes struggle with the daily grind of being a nationally-renowned Big Ten golf coach and a part-time professional player. But on his long, monotonous, familiar drive down Interstate 57, Small ends a very self-aware conversation with the realization that this frustrating-but-rewarding lifestyle is just the balance he needs.\n\n“The mind is so powerful,” Small said. “When you get a little complacent or thinking back on things, you lose that edge. Losing still bothers me, and that’s a good sign. If losing didn’t bother me, I’d probably be happier as a person on the outside, but inside that’s not the way I’m wired. There’s always that struggle and golf creates that struggle for people more than anything you’ve ever seen. That what I struggle with, but it helps my coaching.\n\n“It’s weird. You want to do it [play professionally], but you don’t want to do it badly. It’s tough, and you don’t want your guys to do it badly, so you try harder and harder. It’s a vicious cycle that I need to get a hold of. As of right now, it’s just enough to keep me going and keep me enjoying coaching. Because if I had to coach every day all day, I don’t think I’d be as good of a coach, and if I had to play every day all day, I wouldn’t be as good of a player.”"
