        "text": "Aug. 23, 2005\n\nCOLUMBIA, Mo. - After two rounds of stroke play at the 105th U.S. Amateur in Ardmore, Pa., 246 golfers know they are going home. Wednesday morning, two more will be added to that list.\n\nMizzou junior-to-be Shawn Jasper (Marthasville, Mo. / Francis Howell HS / Newman Univ.) is one of 19 golfers who are tied for 48th place at the conclusion of stroke play; only 17 will advance to complete the 64-player match-play bracket to determine the USGA's national champion. Jasper will join 18 other competitors Tuesday morning on the 13th hole at Merion Golf Club at 7:30 a.m. EDT. The match-play portion will begin once two golfers have been eliminated from the sudden-death playoff.\n\nJasper, who entered the second and final round of stroke play in 144th place, rallied into position with an even-par round of 70 at Philadelphia County Club. Part of the comeback can be attributed to the fact that PCC played nearly four strokes easier than the loop at Merion over the two rounds of stroke play.\n\n\"I got off to a pretty good start today,\" said Jasper, who said that he saw even-par as a round that might get him through to match play. \"I hit into the water on 5 and made double, but I had a pretty good bounce-back with birdies on the two hardest holes on the front nine (6 and 7), and added a third on 8. The back nine just started out pretty solid, but I had to scramble last two holes.\"\n\nKey to his round - and his time outside of Philadelphia - was a 30-foot putt for par on the 15th hole. As for Wednesday morning's playoff, Jasper said, \"I just need to try and make a birdie. It'll be the third time I've played the hole this week, so hopefully there will be some people that have some nerves.\"\n\nSenior-to-be Chris Mabry (Leawood, Kan. / Bishop Miege HS) was faced with the unenviable task of making up ground from his 99th-place position entering the second round with a closing loop around Merion. Mabry struggled to a 9-over 79 in a round without a birdie. He finished the tournament in a tie for 174th place.\n\nFollowing the playoff Wednesday morning, the first round of match play will commence with 32 matches. Canadian James Lepp will enter as the top seed following a two-day total of 5-under 135."
