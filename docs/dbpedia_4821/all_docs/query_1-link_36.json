        "text": "Introduction\n\nThe heme-copper superfamily includes respiratory oxygen reductases, which are proton pumps, as well as NO reductases, which are not pumps (1–4). The superfamily is defined by sequence homology within the integral membrane subunit which contains the catalytic bimetallic center where either O2 is reduced to water or NO is reduced to N2O. In the case of the oxygen reductases, the active site is comprised of a high spin heme and a nearby copper, called CuB. For the NO reductases, the bimetallic center is a high spin heme and a nearby Fe, called FeB. All of the members of the superfamily also contain a second, low spin heme within the same subunit which is required for electron transfer into the active site.\n\nThe respiratory oxygen reductases can be further subdivided into three major families, denoted the A, B and C families (1–3, 5–7). The two families of NO reductases that have been biochemically and structurally characterized, called the cNOR and qNOR families (1, 4, 8–11), are phyllogenetically most closely related to the C-family of oxygen reductases (12–16). The qNOR and cNOR enzymes are very closely related to each other (4, 8, 9, 17), but the cNOR enzymes use a cytochrome c as an electron donor (4), whereas qNORs use a quinol substrate (10).\n\nIt has been noted that in sequence alignments, the cbb3-type oxygen reductases, along with the cNOR and qNOR families have in common a pair of conserved glutamic acid residues that were predicted, prior to the recently available X-ray structures (10, 11), to be near the periplasmic surface of the proteins (18, 19). Site-directed mutagenesis on the cNOR from Paracoccus denitrificans showed that these glutamates are each necessary for function but not for assembly of the enzyme (18, 20, 21). Similar experiments with the cbb3-type oxidases from both Vibrio cholerae and Rhodobacter sphaeroides also indicate that these glutamates are important for function (7). It was suggested that these glutamates might function as part of a proton pathway in the NO reductases to deliver protons to the active site from the periplasm and, in the cbb3-type oxidases, to deliver pumped protons in the opposite direction, from the active site to the periplasm.\n\nX-ray structures are now available for the cbb3-type oxygen reductase from Pseudomonas stutzeri (22), the cNOR from Pseudomonas aeruginosa (11) and the qNOR from Geobacillus stearothermophilus (10). The qNOR is in an inactive form with Zn2+ bound in place of the non-heme FeB. In each case, there is a single Ca2+ that bridges between propionates of the low spin and high spin heme components and, in addition, is ligated to one of the glutamates (e.g., E122 in the P. stutzeri cbb3; E126 in the V. cholerae cbb3; E180 in the R. sphaeroides cbb3; E135 in the P. aeruginosa cNOR; E429 in the G. stearothermophilus qNOR). In each of the structures, the second glutamate of each pair, located 3 residues on the C-terminal side, is not ligated to the Ca2+ but is engaged in a network of hydrogen bonds, more clearly shown in the higher resolution structures of the NO reductases. In the structure of the cbb3-type oxygen reductase, there is extra electron density near (but not adjacent to) the second glutamate which has been suggested as a possible second Ca2+ bound to the enzyme, but there is no indication of a second Ca2+ in the qNOR or cNOR structures.\n\nshows the Ca2+ binding site between the two hemes in the cbb3 oxygen reductase from P. stutzeri. In addition to the Ca2+ bridging the D-propionates of heme b and heme b3, an arginine (Arg57) is hydrogen bonded to the A- and D-propionates of the low-spin heme b.\n\nIn the A- and B-family oxygen reductases, there is also an arginine which hydrogen bonds to both of the propionates of the low spin heme but, in place of the Ca2+ there is a second arginine which bridges the low-spin and active-site hemes by hydrogen bonding to two propionates (23, 24). shows the structure near the low-spin heme a and active-site heme a3 of the A-family cytochrome c oxidase from R. sphaeroides, and compares this to the corresponding region in the cbb3 oxygen reductase from P. stutzeri. Arg481 takes the place of the Ca2+ found in the cbb3 oxygen reductases, and the adjacent Arg482 bridges the two propionates of the low-spin heme. The low-spin heme propionate which is ligated to the Ca2+ in the C-family (cbb3) oxygen reductases (circled in ), as well as in the cNOR and qNOR families, has a different rotomeric configuration than the equivalent propionate which is hydrogen bonded to the adjacent arginine residues in the A- and B-family oxygen reductases. It is of interest that some of the A-family oxygen reductases, including the R. sphaeroides (25) and bovine (26) cytochrome c oxidases, also bind to a single Ca2+, but this cation is not ligated to the heme propionates. Mutagenesis studies have shown that this Ca2+ is not essential either for assembly or function (25, 27).\n\nIn the A- and B-family oxygen reductases, the two adjacent arginines which interact with the heme propionates (R481 and R482 in ) are nearly totally conserved, but there are no conserved acidic residues corresponding to the glutamate pair found in the C-family oxygen reductases and in the cNOR and qNOR enzymes.\n\nIn the current work, mutations of each of the glutamates of the conserved pair in the cbb3 oxygen reducatases from V. cholerae and from R. sphaeroides are further investigated, and it is shown that the loss of activity of the enzymes correlates with the loss of Ca2+. It is concluded that the mutagenesis data cannot be used to support the hypothesis that these glutamates are important for proton delivery to/from the active site in the cbb3 oxygen reductases. It is more likely that these residues are important for maintaining the structures of these enzymes in an active conformation.\n\nDiscussion\n\nPrior to the availability of X-ray structures, the conserved pair of glutamates in a putative periplasmic “loop” appeared to be reasonable candidates as participants in proton translocation to/from the active sites of the cbb3-type (C-family) oxygen reductases as well as the related cNOR and qNOR families of NO reductases. Models suggested that these glutamates might be located near the perisplasmic surface of the proteins (18, 19) and site-directed mutagenesis indicated that the glutamates are functionally important in both the cbb3 oxygen reductases and cNOR enzymes (18, 20, 21). In the case of the cNOR enzymes, protons required for the chemistry at the active site come from the periplasm (18, 33, 34) and the limited data were consistent with these glutamates playing a role to provide a pathway for proton transfer to the active site (34). For the cbb3 enzymes, protons for the chemistry at the active site must come from the opposite side of the membrane (2, 7), so the glutamates were proposed to provide a pathway for pumped protons to exit to the periplasm (7). The X-ray structures (10, 11, 22) as well as recent functional information, including the data presented in the current work, make these proposals much less likely.\n\nThe X-ray structures of the cbb3 oxygen reductase, the cNOR and the qNOR each reveal a single Ca2+ that bridges propionates on heme b and heme b3, and is also ligated to a glutamate carboxyl (10, 11, 22), E122 in the case of the P. stutzeri cbb3. There is extra electron density in the P. stutzeri cbb3 structure (22) that suggests the possibility of a second Ca2+ near E125. Metal analysis also indicates that there might be a second Ca2+ present in the P. stutzeri cbb3 oxidase (22). The current data on the V. cholerae and R. sphaeroides cbb3 enzymes are similarly ambiguous about the possibility of a second Ca2+ ( ). Metal impurities in the protein preparations, present even after three column chromatography steps, as well as possible loss of metals, contribute to the uncertainty.\n\nThe X-ray data (10, 11, 22) show that in each of these enzyme families (cbb3, cNOR, qNOR), the two glutamates are not near the surface in contact with the bulk aqueous phase, but are more interior. The upstream member of the pair (lower residue number) is, in each case, ligated to a Ca2+. The downstream glutamate is not ligated to the Ca2+ nor part of a salt bridge, but participates in a network of hydrogen bond interactions in each protein. The possible second Ca2+ in the cbb3 structure is located near this downstream glutamate (22). There is only one Ca2+ in the structures of the cNOR and qNOR (10, 11).\n\nThe very high (> 99%) degree of conservation of each of the two glutamates in the sequences of the cbb3 oxygen reductases makes it evident that they are both important in these enzymes ( ). This is confirmed by the site-directed mutagenesis presented in the current work ( ). Regardless of the uncertainty of whether there is one or two Ca2+ in the wild type enzymes, the pattern for both the V. cholerae and R. sphaeroides cbb3 mutants is that substitution for either of the glutamates results in substantial loss of activity as well as partial or complete loss of Ca2+ ( ). Changing the Ca2+ ligand, E126 (V. cholerae) or E180 (R. sphaeroides), results in virtually complete loss of function as well as partial or complete loss of Ca2+ ( ). In the R. sphaeroides mutants, the extent of evident damage is greater, including loss of CuB. Note that if the wild type enzyme is interpreted to contain 2 Ca2+, then a single mutation (E180D or E180Q) results in the loss of both Ca2+. Loss of function due to these mutations can be most easily interpreted as a consequence of gross conformational changes. The mutagenesis data do not rule out a role of this glutamate in proton translocation but, importantly, cannot be used in support of such a role. If E180 were to cycle through a state during catalysis in which it were protonated and no ligated to the Ca2+, one might not expect the E180Q mutation to cause so much damage since glutamine to some extent resembles a protonated glutamate.\n\nChanging the downstream glutamate, E129 (V. cholerae) or E183 (R. sphaeroides), also invariably results in loss of function, though the results are more varied and not as absolute as observed with the mutations of the Ca2+-ligating glutamate. The V. cholerae protein is more tolerant of mutations at this position than is the R. sphaeroides enzyme. E129D and E129Q in the V. cholerae enzyme retain 11% and 18% activity, respectively, whereas E183D and E183Q from the R. sphaeroides oxidases retain only 1% and 7% activity. In all cases, either partial or complete loss of Ca2+ is observed.\n\nThe following are reasonable conclusions from the data.\n\nThe cbb3 oxygen reductases contain a either one or two Ca2+. Our data do not resolve this uncertainly, raised initially from the work on the enzyme from the P. stutzeri enzyme (22).\n\nThe Ca2+ at the binding site that is apparent in the X-ray structure is essential for function of the cbb3 oxygen reductases. Mutations that result in the loss of Ca2+ or disruption of the Ca2+ binding site results in the loss of enzyme activity. It is likely that the Ca2+ is important to maintain the protein in a conformation in which the hemes and CuB are functional. The role of the Ca2+ to form a bridge between the CcoN and CcoO subunits is also critical, as evidenced by the lack of protein assembly when the Ca2+-liganding amino acid in the CcoO subunit (S105) is substituted by another amino acid. The essential nature of the Ca2+ in the cbb3 oxygen reductases is in contrast to the Ca2+ which binds near the low-spin heme in some of the A-family oxygen reductases, but which is not required for assembly or enzyme activity (25, 27).\n\nDepending on the mutation and which enzyme is studied, mutating the non-liganding glutamate (downstream member of the pair), the cbb3 enzyme can be inactivated along with partial or complete loss of Ca2+. There is no reason to attribute the loss of function to blocking proton transfer of the pumped proton away from the cbb3 active site. It is not evident, in any event, that blocking the pumped proton would necessarily inhibit oxidase activity.\n\nThe conclusion that the role of the Ca2+ is primarily to stabilize the heme and protein for optimal activity has also been made for the related NOR enzymes (4, 8–10). Note that the two glutamates examined in the current work are not nearly as well conserved in the cNOR and qNOR sequences as in the sequences of the cbb3 oxygen reductases ( ). This is particularly true for the qNORs. When present, the Ca2+ ligands are important, as shown by the fact that mutants of each of the Ca2+ ligands (E429 and Y93) in the qNOR from Geobacillus stearothermophilus lose most of their activity as well as Ca2+ (10). It is possible that in the qNOR and cNOR variants lacking the equivalent glutamate, the Ca2+ has a different ligand or, alternatively, the role of the Ca2+ is filled by alternative structural features. There are credible hydrophilic pathways which bypass the two glutamates for delivering protons from the periplasm to the active site in the cNOR enzymes, so there is no need to propose any role of the glutamate pair in proton translocation in either the cNOR or qNOR enzymes (4, 9). Experimental tests will be required, however, to determine the input pathway(s) for protons to reach the active sites of the qNOR and cNOR enzymes."
