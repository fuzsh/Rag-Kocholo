As a civil engineer, John was involved in bridge construction and road building. He found his calling as the executive director of the Canadian Roofing Contractors’ Association, a position he held for 25 years.\n\nJohn was talented in so many ways. He was creative and handy, and could solve any issue with a quick redesign.\n\nJohn was a passionate golfer, often playing 27-36 holes in a day with his brother Paddy.\n\nHe was a loyal CFL fan holding season tickets with Rough Riders, Renegades and RedBlacks franchises. He instilled the love of the game in his daughters.\n\nHe loved cars, from sports cars to luxury vehicles and everything in between.\n\nEight years ago, John took on a new role, one that would be a part of his legacy. He became a grandfather and his grandchildren were his world. His eight grandchildren adored him and the feeling was mutual.\n\nFriends and family gathered at McEvoy-Shields Funeral Home, 1411 Hunt Club Road, on Sunday, Nov. 3.\n\nThe funeral was held on Monday, Nov. 4, 2019 at Holy Cross Church, 685 Walkley Road, Ottawa, Ont.
