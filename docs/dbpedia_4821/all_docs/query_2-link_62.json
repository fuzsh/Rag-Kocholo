Here are some nuggets and facts to know as the first swing happens...</p><separator></separator><p>NCAA HISTORY<br> The Sun Devils have won two NCAA titles, in 1990 under coach and 2002 ASU Hall of Fame inductee <a href=\"http://thesundevils.cstv.com/sports/m-golf/mtt/loy_steve00.html\">Steve Loy</a>, and in 1996 under current head coach and 2008 National Golf Coaches Hall of Fame inductee <a href=\"http://thesundevils.cstv.com/sports/m-golf/mtt/lein_randy00.html\">Randy Lein</a>. What is good to know is that in 1996, the team won the NCAA at the Honors Course in Tennessee. That is the site of the this year's NCAA Championships.</p><separator></separator><p>SUN DEVILS PROGRAM CHATTER<br> In the past 17 seasons (since <a href=\"http://thesundevils.cstv.com/sports/m-golf/mtt/lein_randy00.html\">Randy Lein</a> took over at ASU) 12 different team champions have been crowned and Lein is the only coach to have two individual champions in that time (freshman <a href=\"http://thesundevils.cstv.com/sports/m-golf/mtt/canizares_alejandro00.ht… Canizares</a> in 2003 and Todd Demsey in 1993). ASU also has finished in the top six nine times in those 17 years and has qualified for the NCAA Championships in 25 of the past 26 seasons, missing only in 2002, including each of the past seven seasons, tied for the fourth-best mark in the nation in that time.</p><separator></separator><p>THE HEAD COACH:<br><a href=\"http://thesundevils.cstv.com/sports/m-golf/mtt/lein_randy00.html\">Randy Lein</a>, who was inducted into the NGCA Hall of Fame in January of 2009, notched the top team accolade in collegiate golf in 1995-96 - the NCAA title - to his collection as the Sun Devils won the title in Chattanooga, Tenn., with a three-stroke victory over UNLV at the Honors Course. In his 17th season as ASU's coach, Lein has guided ASU to 43 tournament victories (including a school record six in 1995-96), eight Pac-10 titles, five NCAA West Regional wins and 10 top-10 finishes at the NCAAs including the 1996 title. In addition, Lein has tutored NCAA medalists Todd Demsey (1994) and <a href=\"http://thesundevils.cstv.com/sports/m-golf/mtt/canizares_alejandro00.ht… Canizares</a> (2003) and 18 All-Americans (39 occasions): Todd Demsey (3), Chris Hanell (3), <a href=\"http://thesundevils.cstv.com/sports/m-golf/mtt/casey_paul00.html\">Paul Casey</a> (3), Cade Stone, Chris Stutts, Joey Snyder (2), Scott Johnson (2), Darren Angel (2), <a href=\"http://thesundevils.cstv.com/sports/m-golf/mtt/quinney_jeff00.html\">Jeff Quinney</a> (3), <a href=\"http://thesundevils.cstv.com/sports/m-golf/mtt/jones_matt00.html\">Matt Jones</a> (2), <a href=\"http://thesundevils.cstv.com/sports/m-golf/mtt/reavie_chez00.html\">Chez Reavie</a> (3), <a href=\"http://thesundevils.cstv.com/sports/m-golf/mtt/canizares_alejandro00.ht… Canizares</a> (4), <a href=\"http://thesundevils.cstv.com/sports/m-golf/mtt/lemke_niklas00.html\">Nik… Lemke</a> (3), <a href=\"http://thesundevils.cstv.com/sports/m-golf/mtt/alvaradoholley_benjamin0… Alvarado Holley</a> (2), <a href=\"http://thesundevils.cstv.com/sports/m-golf/mtt/kennegard_jesper00.html\"… Kennegard</a> (2), <a href=\"http://thesundevils.cstv.com/sports/m-golf/mtt/pinckney_scott00.html\">S… Pinckney</a>, <a href=\"http://thesundevils.cstv.com/sports/m-golf/mtt/borsheim_knut00.html\">Kn… Borsheim</a> and <a href=\"http://thesundevils.cstv.com/sports/m-golf/mtt/gross_stephan00.html\">St… Gross</a>. He has won Pac-10 Coach-of-the-Year five times (1993, 1995, 1996, 1999 and 2000) while at ASU and twice at USC (1980 and 1986). Lein (pronounced \"Line\") is a 1975 graduate of Cal State Northridge.</p><separator></separator><p><img src=\"http://grfx.cstv.com/graphics/spacer.gif&quot; height=\"1border=0\" width=\"5\"><br>IT ISN'T EASY<br> ASU has made the NCAA Championship in the past seven seasons and in 16 of 17 seasons under <a href=\"http://thesundevils.cstv.com/sports/m-golf/mtt/lein_randy00.html\">Randy Lein</a>, but it sure isn't getting easier with the 30-team, three-round regional format. Using Golfweek's rankings prior to the NCAA Championship, nine top 30 teams did not go to Toledo last season, a list that included seventh-ranked Clemson, No. 18 LSU, No. 21 Indiana, No. 23 UNLV, No. 24 NC State, No. 25 San Diego State, No. 28 Ole Miss, No. 29 Colorado State and No. 30 Florida State. <!-- STORY AD ENDS HERE --></p><separator></separator><p>IT ISN'T EASY, PART TWO<br>Of the 30 teams that made the 2009 NCAA Championships, only 15 played in the 2008 championship: UCLA, Stanford, USC, Oklahoma State, Washington, Georgia, Florida, Texas A&amp;M, Alabama, Arizona State, Illinois, Texas, Wake Forest and Oregon.</p><separator></separator><p>ASU IN THE REGIONALS<br> With the May 14-16 victories by both the team and <a href=\"http://thesundevils.cstv.com/sports/m-golf/mtt/kennegard_jesper00.html\"… Kennegard</a> at the 2009 West Regional, ASU has won or tied for the title in a NCAA Regional six times.

Sun Devil <a href=\"http://thesundevils.cstv.com/sports/m-golf/mtt/casey_paul00.html\">Paul Casey</a> won the 1998 individual title outright followed by <a href=\"http://thesundevils.cstv.com/sports/m-golf/mtt/quinney_jeff00.html\">Jeff Quinney</a> (1999), <a href=\"http://thesundevils.cstv.com/sports/m-golf/mtt/alvaradoholley_benjamin0… Alvarado Holley</a> (2007) and then <a href=\"http://thesundevils.cstv.com/sports/m-golf/mtt/kennegard_jesper00.html\"… Kennegard</a> this season. <a href=\"http://thesundevils.cstv.com/sports/m-golf/mtt/jones_matt00.html\">Matt Jones</a> shared medalist honors in 2001.</p><separator></separator><p>ASU'S BEST FRESHMEN<br><a href=\"http://thesundevils.cstv.com/sports/m-golf/mtt/kim_chan00.html\">Chan Kim</a> posted a 72.20 stroke average in 2008-2009, just .55 off Alejandro Canizares' 2002-03 ASU freshman mark of 71.65 when he won the NCAA title.</p><separator></separator><p>ASU FRESHMAN SCORING AVERAGES (1985-2009)<br> 1. <a href=\"http://thesundevils.cstv.com/sports/m-golf/mtt/canizares_alejandro00.ht… Canizares</a>, 8 events, 2002-03, 71.65<br> 2.

ASU is back in the saddle with seven straight, and to show you how competitive the NCAA men's golf champioships is, that streak already is tied for the sixth-best active streak, as Arizona (1987-2007) had a 21-year streak snapped in 2008 after failing to post a .500 record and not make regionals, while Georgia Tech did not qualify out of regional action in 2008 after making the NCAAs for 10 straight years (1998-2007). Only six teams have made the NCAAs in each of the past five seasons.</p><separator></separator><p>CONSECUTIVE NCAA CHAMPIONSHIP APPEARANCES<br> 1. Oklahoma State, 1947-2009, 63<br> 2.
