Fisher, made the observation that \"Events in the past may be roughly divided into those which probably never happened and those which do not matter.\" If the Gloomy Dean is correct, what is the historical significance of the 1995 discovery of the top quark? I will discuss what we do and don't know about top-quark physics, and describe what CDF is going to do about it during the Tevatron-collider run that is now underway.
