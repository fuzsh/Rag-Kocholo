        "text": "May 8, 2006\n\nSeattle - Washington junior men's golfer Alex Prugh has been named to the Pac-10 All-Conference first team in voting by the Pac-10 men's golf coaches. Senior James Lepp was named to the second team, while junior Erik Olson received honorable mention honors. Alejandro Canizares of Arizona State and Rob Grube were named the Pac-10 Co-Golfers of the Year, Erik Flores was named the Pac-10 Freshman of the Year, and UCLA's O.D. Vincent was tabbed as the Pac-10 Coach of the Year.\n\nPrugh, a native of Spokane, Wash., leads the Huskies with a 72.33 scoring average, a mark that would stand as the fifth-best single-season average in Husky history, were the season to end today. An All-Pac-10 second team honoree in 2005, Prugh led UW in seven tournaments this season, recording four Top-10 finishes. He placed second at the Gopher Invitational and the National Invitational, while taking fifth at the PING/Golfweek Fall Preview and sixth at the U.S. Intercollegiate. Prugh placed 14th at the 2006 Pac-10 Championships, shooting a first-round 6-under 65 that established a new career-best for a single round.\n\nLepp, from Abbotsford, B.C., placed eighth at the 2006 Pac-10 Championship, shooting even-par 284, including a season-low 6-under 65 in the second round. The 2005 NCAA Champion, Lepp has recorded three Top-10 finishes this season and has a 73.06 scoring average, second best on the team. He was an All-Pac-10 first-team selection in 2005.\n\nOlson, who won the Pac-10 Individual Championship in 2005, was the Huskies' top finisher at the Pac-10s again in 2006, placing third at 3-under 281. The junior from Renton, Wash, has a scoring average of 73.27 on the season with three Top-10 finishes. Olson was a Pac-10 first-team All-Conference pick in 2005.\n\nCanizares, a senior from Manilva, Spain, was voted Player of the Year for the second straight year by the Pac-10 coaches, the first player since Tiger Woods (Stanford, 1995-96) to be selected in consecutive years. A three-time first-team All-Pac-10 selection and former NCAA champion, Canizares posted another top-flight season by finishing in the top six in four of 11 tournaments, capped by a win in the PING/Arizona Intercollegiate. Canizares posted a scoring average of 71.85 strokes, with eight of 34 tournament rounds under 70.\n\nGrube, from Hinsdale, Ill., followed up on being named Pac-10 Freshman of the Year in 2005 by earning Co-Player of the Year honors as a sophomore this season. He is the top-ranked Pac-10 golfer in the most recent Golfweek rankings by virtue of finishing in the top 10 in eight of 11 tournaments this year. Included were victories in the U.S. Intercollegiate and the Western Intercollegiate. Grube compiled a scoring average of 71.19 strokes with nine of 32 rounds under 70.\n\nFlores, from Grass Valley, Calif., burst on the scene with seven top 10 finishes in 10 events as a freshman, including six finishes in the top three. He posted a stroke average of 72.10 in tournament play with nine of 30 rounds under 70.\n\nVincent directed a young UCLA squad to the Pac-10 Championship, the Bruins' second league title in his four years at the helm. UCLA won an astounding 11 team championships this season. In addition to the Pac-10 Championships, the Bruin team titles included the Mercedes-Benz Collegiate Championship, the National Invitational Tournament, the U.S. Intercollegiate, The Prestige at PGA WEST and the Corde Valle Collegiate. Vincent, who won the Pac-10 Championship as a player with Washington in 1988, was named Pac-10 Coach of the Year for the third time, having previously been selected in 2003 at UCLA and 1999 while coaching Washington.\n\nALL-PAC-10 FIRST TEAM\n\nName School Yr.
