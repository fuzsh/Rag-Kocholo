Myra Bradwell was one of the nation’s most important advocates for women’s rights in the late nineteenth century, a lawyer and publisher who helped eliminate gender discrimination in employment, property rights, and voting. Believing that “woman has a right to think and act as an individual,” Myra helped write and lobbied for passage of the Illinois Married Women’s Property Act of 1861 and the Earnings Act of 1869, state laws which allowed married women to control their earnings and property. She apprenticed in her husband’s law office, and founded the Chicago Legal News, but both the Illinois State Supreme Court (1870) and the United States Supreme Court (1873) refused to grant her a law license due to her sex. She ultimately received her law license after fighting for another Illinois law to prohibit sex discrimination in employment. Her husband, James Bradwell, a lawyer, politician, Northwestern Trustee, was one of the strong voices in favor of admitting women to Northwestern when the coeducation resolution was hotly debated, and finally passed, by the Board of Trustees on June 23, 1869. As the Chicago Tribune reported the following day, “Judge Bradwell spoke with characteristic force on the woman question.” The couple helped organize the first meeting of the American Woman Suffrage Association, and later worked together to pass legislation in Illinois allowing women to vote on school boards.
