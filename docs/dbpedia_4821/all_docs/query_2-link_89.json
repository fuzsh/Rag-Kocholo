        "text": "March 7, 2003\n\nNORMAN, Okla. - Wake Forest junior Bill Haas has been named to the watch list for the 2003 Ben Hogan Award, as announced by The Friends of Golf (FOG) and Colonial Country Club, in cooperation with Bank of America and the Golf Coaches Association of America (GCAA). The Ben Hogan is presented annually to the top men's NCAA Division I, II or III or NAIA golfer. Taking into account all collegiate and amateur competitions during the last 12 months, the watch list includes 20 golfers.\n\nHaas, who was one of 10 semifinalists for the award last season, is making his second straight appearance on the watch list. Haas has won three intercollegiate events so far in the 2002-03 season. He was the stroke play medalist at the 2002 U.S. Amateur and advanced to the semifinals in match play.\n\n\"Obviously, the list represents the finest players across the country at all levels of college golf,\" stated GCAA Executive Director Gregg Grost. \"I feel it's significant that we see individuals from all areas of the country on the list as well as international players. It's important to note that the Hogan Award winner does not necessarily have to come from individuals on this list, however, at this time the committee feels that this group has stepped to the front during the past nine months.\"\n\nThe Hogan Award selection committee will select 10 semi-finalists on April 11 and name five finalists on April 25. The winner of the Hogan Award will be announced on May 9 and the presentation banquet will be held at Colonial Country Club on May 19, the Monday prior to the Bank of America Colonial."
