        "meta_description": "May 21, 2003 Larry Penley's Clemson golf team remains ranked number-one in the nation in all three college golf polls entering the NCAA national tournament. Clemson has been ranked number-one by Golf World, Golfweek/Sagarin and the Precept Coach's poll for every poll this spring. Clemson has been number-one since the fall in the Precept and the Golf World polls. In the Precept Coach's Poll, Clemson earned 21 of the 30 first place votes. No other school had more than three first-place votes. The Tigers are ranked ahead of second-place Augusta State and third-ranked Texas. Wake Forest is ranked fourth, meaning three of the top four teams in the nation are in the Southeast. Clemson is first and Florida is second in the Sagarin/Golfweek Computer Poll. The Tigers have a margin of 1.02 rating points. Clemson's distance between itself and Florida is equal to the margin in rating points between the Gators and 17th ranked New Mexico, an indication of Clemson's strength in the computer poll this year. Clemson has a 95-8-3 record in head to head tournament competition against the top Top 25 teams, by far the best top 25 record in the nation. That is a .910 winning percentage, far ahead of Oklahoma State's .696 figure (58-25-1), the second best percentage against top 25 competion. Clemson is also ranked number-two by Golfweek in terms of strength of schedule, trailing only Texas. Individually, Clemson has three of the top 10 players in the nation according to the Golfweek/Sagarin rankings. D.J. Trahan is second, while Jack Ferguson is fifth and Matt Hendrix is 10th. Gregg Jones has moved up to 41st after his outstanding second place finish in the NCAA East Regional. Clemson is the only school in the nation with three players ranked in the top 10 and four in the top 50. Only Florida and Texas have as many as three top 50 players. Clemson has never finished a season with three players ranked in the top 10 in the final individual poll. The number-one ranked player in the nation is Hunter Mahan of Oklahoma State.Precept Coach's Poll (As of May 6, 2003) Rk School Pts 1. Clemson 709 2. Augusta State 650 3. Texas 637 4.
