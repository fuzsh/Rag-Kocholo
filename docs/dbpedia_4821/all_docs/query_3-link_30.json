The 2015 GCAA Dave Williams National Coach of the Year has guided the Illini to 13 of the last 15 Big Ten Championship titles, including a conference-record run of eight straight from 2015 through 2023 to established a new standard for sustained excellence in the league.\n\nSince 2010 Small has mentored two NCAA individual champions - Scott Langley (2010) and Thomas Pieters (2012) - and also coached 13 Big Ten Player of the Year honorees, beginning with James Lepp (2003) - a second-team All-American for the Illini - Langley - a three-time All-American - Luke Guthrie (2010) - a two-time individual Big Ten champion who held the program’s career stroke average record at the end of his career - Pieters (2013) - a two-time All-American who helped the Illini to an NCAA runner-up finish in 2013 - Brian Campbell (2014), who broke Guthrie’s season stroke average and earned All-America honors in 2014 - Thomas Detry (2015) a three-time All-American who is among Illinois’ career stroke average leaders - Charlie Danielson (2016) – Illinois’ first and only four-time All-American who again reset the all-time low season stroke average – Dylan Meyer (2017) – a three-time All-American and Ben Hogan Award finalist – Nick Hardy (2018) – a two-time Individual Big Ten Champion and two-time All-American - Adrien Dumont de Chassart (2021, 2022 and 2023) - just third golfer in Big Ten history to earn the award three times while also becoming the Illini’s career stroke average leader - and Jackson Buchanan (2024).\n\nUnder Small’s direction, the Illini program has seen consistent success as his teams have not only continued to achieve greatness at the conference level, but on the national level as well. Small has led Illinois to top-five NCAA finishes in nine of the last 13 postseasons, including a runner-up finish in 2013. Illinois has advanced past NCAA Regionals to the NCAA Championship 17 times under Small’s guidance, including a run of 13 straight from 2008 to 2021, a streak that ranked second nationally during time. The Orange and Blue have won six NCAA Regional titles, including four consecutive NCAA Regional Championships from 2013-2016, becoming one of just two schools in NCAA history to do so. Since the start of the 2014-15 season, Small’s Illini have been a consistent force among the top 25 in the Golfweek/Bushnell Coaches’ Poll, and own the longest streak ranked in the top spot. Small was again recognized for his coaching success in 2016 as he was inducted into the Golf Coaches Association of America Hall of Fame.\n\nSmall has been named Big Ten Coach of the Year a conference-record 13 times in his career (2023, 2022, 2019, 2018, 2017, 2016, 2015, 2013, 2012, 2011, 2010, 2009, 2002) and has also been named Midwest Regional Coach of the Year on 13 occasions (2024, 2023, 2021, 2019, 2018, 2016, 2015, 2014, 2013, 2011, 2010, 2009, 2003). Under his direction, 19 Illini have won 37 All-America honors and 65 All-Big Ten accolades garnered by 28 student-athletes.\n\nSmall’s players continue to see success after college as well. Illinois boasts several alumni in the professional ranks highlighted by Steve Stricker, D.A. Points, Thomas Pieters, Thomas Detry, Brian Campbell, Luke Guthrie, Dylan Meyer, Nick Hardy, Michael Feagles, Adrien Dumont de Chassart, and Matthis Besard. Illinois graduates Chris DeForest (2011), Langley (2010, 2012 and 2013), Campbell (2015, 2024), Charlie Danielson (2016 and 2019), Pieters (2020, 2022, 2023), and Detry (2020, 2021, 2024) also have qualified for the U.S. Open, as did then-current Illini Campbell (2014), Hardy (2015, 2016), Meyer (2018, 2021), Adrien Dumont de Chassart (2022), and Jackson Buchanan (2024). Both Langley and Campbell earned low amateur finishes at the prestigious championship. Illinois’ most recent NCAA champion, Pieters, is currently playing in the LIV Golf League, while fellow Belgian, Detry, has competed primarily on the PGA Tour, alongside Hardy, since 2022-23 - where they were joined by Dumont de Chassart during his rookie campaign in 2023-24. Pieters posted six tournament wins on the DP World Tour and represented Europe in the Ryder Cup. He also represented his home country of Belgium in the 2016 Rio Olympics, and again at the 2020 Tokyo Olympics along with Detry. In addition, Pieters tied for fourth at the 2017 Masters. Detry posted the best finish of his carer in a major tournament at the 2024 PGA Championship (T5).\n\nSeveral Illini have represented the program on a national level, competing in the Arnold Palmer Cup, as Langley won the clinching match at the Palmer Cup in 2010 and Pieters helped Europe clinch the 2012 Palmer Cup by halving both of his singles matches in the event. Detry went 3-1 in helping Europe to a 2014 Palmer Cup win, while Danielson received the event’s Michael Carter sportsmanship award in 2016. Hardy carried on the tradition, helping the United States win the cup in 2017. Most recently Adrien Dumont de Chassart competed for Team International at the 2021 and 2022 Palmer Cups, and Tommy Kuhl helped Team USA to victory in 2023. Langley, Pieters and Detry also represented the United States on the national team for the World Amateur Team Championships in Argentina, and Dylan Meyer wore the national colors at the Australian Master of the Amateurs.\n\nIn addition to success on the course, Small’s players have experienced great academic success, capturing several Big Ten Medal of Honor awards with Scott Langley in 2011, Luke Guthrie in 2012, Charlie Danielson in 2016, and Adrien Dumont de Chassart in 2023. Additionally, his players have earned 83 Academic All-Big Ten honors.\n\nSmall has the distinction of playing on a Big Ten championship team and coaching 13 more. As a former full-time professional, he can share with aspiring tour players what it takes to play at the next level. As someone who still competes and succeeds at a handful of high-profile events each year, he has had a chance to rub elbows with the likes of Tiger Woods and Phil Mickelson.\n\nSmall has continued his professional career while coaching, most recently playing on the PGA TOUR Champions. Since 2000, he is a three-time winner of the PGA Professional National Championship, a three-time PGA Professional National Player of the Year, a 14-time IPGA Champion, four-time Illinois Open Champion and he has participated in 13 major championships. Small has made the cut in 15 of 34 PGA TOUR events since he began coaching at Illinois, and 18 of 19 PGA TOUR Champions events, earning three top 10 finishes and playing in three U.S. Senior Opens. He was also named the 2017 OMEGA Senior PGA Professional Player of the Year.\n\nYear-by-Year Highlights\n\n2023-24: Illinois closed as the No. 6 team in the NCAA Division I men’s golf rankings, posting a head-to-head record of 157-27-1 with six team tournament victories, including the NCAA Stanford Regioanl followed by a first-place showing in stroke play at the NCAA Championship.
