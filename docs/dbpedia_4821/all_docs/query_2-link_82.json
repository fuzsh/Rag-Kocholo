His round was highlighted by three birdies and 13 pars. The only other time he fired a 70 was in the first round of the 2001 Kepler Intercollegiate (April 14-15, 2001).\n\nFreshman Christian Vozza is playing in his first collegiate tournament. In his first collegiate round he carded a one-over-par 72. After playing one under par through his first 15 holes, he bogeyed two of his last three holes to finish his round at plus-one.\n\nSenior/junior Scott Carlton is making his first tournament appearance of the year for the Wolverines.\n\nQ U O T E S\n\nHead Coach Andrew Sapp\n\nOn the first day of the Northern Intercollegiate ... \"We came out and played really well in the first round. The second round we hit some rough spots, but we have three or five holes to go tomorrow morning to finish the second round and then we will try to do our best in the final round. Dave Nichols and Christian Vozza started off well for us. For Christian to come out in his first collegiate round and shoot a 72, that is pretty solid. He has been a definite bright spot. We just need to try and improve and turn some things around and try and gain some momentum heading into our home tournament next weekend.\""
