        "text": "Let me ask you a question: When considering college, what’s the most important thing to you? Based on data collected on thousands of junior golfers, the top 3 answers are: academics, the coach and weather.\n\nSince I love data, I thought it would be interesting to see how much weather actually matters for the development of golfers. I examined the weather for junior golf homes of top 20 male professional golfers, current top 20 amateurs in the World Amateur Golf Rankings and the last 20 individual NCAA National Champions. When gathering the data, I categorized each player on the list based on data from weather.com into 3 categories:\n\n300+ days of golf per year with weather of at least 60 degrees\n\n225+ days of golf per year with weather of at least 60 degrees\n\n150 or so days of golf per year with weather of at least 60 degrees\n\nExamples of 1’s are Florida, Arizona, Texas, Georgia, South Carolina and California, examples of 2’s are Ohio, Oklahoma, Texas and examples of 3 are South Korea, Northern Ireland, Wisconsin, Canada and the Dakota’s.\n\nPlease note: while players might be from the same country, the regions have very different climates. Since the climates are different, the players ended in dissimilar categories.\n\nThe top 20 Players in the World\n\nCategory 1\n\nDustin Johnston (South Carolina), Brooks Keopka (Florida), Jordan Spieth (Texas), Rickie Fowler (California), Jason Day (Australia), Patrick Reed (Texas), Bubba Watson (Florida), Phil Mickelson (California), Marc Leishman (Australia), Sergio (Spain)\n\nTotal = 10\n\nCategory 2\n\nJustin Thomas (Kentucky), John Rahm (Spain), Hideki Matsuyama (Japan), Franscesco Molinari (Italy)\n\nTotal = 4\n\nCategory 3\n\nJustin Rose (England), Rory McIlroy (N. Ireland), Tommy Fleetwood (England), Paul Casey (England), Alex Noren (Sweden), Henrik Stenson (Sweden)\n\nTotal = 6\n\nTop 20 Players in the World Amateur Golf Ranking\n\nCategory 1\n\nBraden Thornberry (Mississippi), Justin Suh (California), Collin Morikawa (California), Min Woo Lee (Australia), Chandler Phillips (Texas, Fredrik Nilehn (Texas), Sadom Kaewkanjana (Thailand), Andy Zhang (Florida), Matthew Wolff (California / Oklahoma), Angel Hidalgo Portillo (Spain), Shintaro Ban (Nevada)\n\nTotal = 11\n\nCategory 2\n\nZach Bauchou (Oklahoma/Virginia)\n\nTotal = 1\n\nCategory 3\n\nVictor Hovland (Oklahoma/Norway), Matthew Jordan (England), Oliver Gillbery (Sweden), Nicolai Hojgaard (Denmark), Robin Dawson (Ireland), Todd Clements (England), , David Micheluzzi (Australia), Stewart Hagestad (New York)\n\nTotal = 8\n\nThe last 20 Individual NCAA Champions\n\nCategory 1\n\nBraden Thornberry (Mississippi), Aaron Wise (Cape Town, SA / Live in California), Max Homa (California), John Peterson (Texas), Kevin Chappell (California), Jamie Lovemark (California), Jonathan Moore (California), Alejandro Canizares (Spain), Troy Matteson (Florida), Charles Howell (Georgia) and James Mclean (Australia)\n\nTotal = 11\n\nCategory 2\n\nJames Lepp (Canada)\n\nTotal = 1\n\nCategory 3\n\nBroc Everett (Iowa), Cameron Wilson (Connecticut), Thomas Pieters (Belgium), Scott Langley (Illinois), Matt Hill (Canada), Ryan Moore (Washington), Nick Gilliam (Wisconsin), Luke Donald (England)\n\nTotal = 8\n\nConclusion\n\nBased on the data, 53 percent (32/60) came from category 1 climates, 10 percent (6/60) came from category 2 climates and 37 percent (22/60) came from category 3 climates. Surprised? While more research is needed to fully understand the nuances, environment is certainly tied to the individuals learning. Based on this, here are some takeaways for players from different climates.\n\nIdeal Climates: While you have the best opportunity based on the weather and course conditions to shoot a good score, it is important to invest in developing different shot shapes and trajectories, as well as learning to play in the rain / wind when it comes; next time it’s raining in Southern California run to the first tee and get in 9 holes. When the weather is idea, consider playing different games to sharpen your skills. For example, play with just irons, or ever other iron, or the rough out of bounds or play where your competitor names the shot shape you need to hit each shot.\n\nLess than Ideal Climates: While you have less opportunity to shoot low scores in perfect weather and conditions, you have great opportunities to invest in skills that will serve you in the long run. In my experience the best players from these climates use cold months very carefully to refine technical skills through lots of block practice. They are also diligent about the time they have on the course, keeping careful stats and making sure nice days are spent at the course engaged in competition. When the weather is not ideal, don’t be afraid to play from a much shorter yardage to ensure you can still shoot good scores.\n\nYour Reaction?\n\nLIKE39\n\nLEGIT11\n\nWOW2\n\nLOL0\n\nIDHT0\n\nFLOP1\n\nOB0\n\nSHANK9\n\nIn recent years, YouTube has profoundly changed the landscape of golf, contributing to its resurgence in popularity and making the sport more accessible and engaging to a broader audience.

The numbers for on course, off course, and those who enjoyed a mix of both shook out like this the past three years:\n\nOn Course Only Off Course Only Both On & Off Total 2021 12.6 Million 12.4 Million 12.5 Million 37.6 Million 2022 13.2 Million 15.5 Million 12.4 Million 41.1 Million 2023 12.1 Million 18.5 Million 14.4 Million 45.0 Million\n\nThis growth is partly attributed to the visibility and appeal generated by golf content on YouTube, especially for those in the off-course and mixed segments.\n\nEngagement Metrics: Channels like Rick Shiels have videos that consistently receive hundreds of thousands of views, indicating a strong and engaged audience. A significant proportion of these views come from instructional content, suggesting that many golfers are turning to YouTube for learning and improvement.\n\nEquipment Sales Impact: YouTube content has a remarkable influence on equipment sales. According to a 2023 report by Golf Datatech, golf equipment sales surged by 10% in 2022, with many attributing this growth to the influence of online reviews and tutorials by trusted YouTubers.\n\nDiversifying Content\n\nGolf YouTubers now produce a diverse array of content, from tutorials and club reviews to global collaborations and unique challenges. This variety caters to different interests and skill levels, making the sport more appealing to a broader range of people. The increased focus on data-driven content has also seen creators incorporating statistical analysis and expert insights into their videos, enhancing their educational value.\n\nProfessional Golf Finally Taking Notice\n\nAs I reported recently on RG.org in my article, “YouTube Golf: Transforming the Game, One Click and View at a Time, And Mainstream Golf Has Now Officially Taken Notice,” the powers that be in mainstream professional golf are starting to take notice of the influence that golf content creation is having on the game. The PGA TOUR’s recent announcement of its inaugural “Creator Classic”, an event scheduled to run the Wednesday before the 2024 TOUR Championship, will bring together some of the best golf digital creators to compete on the East Lake layout.\n\nYou have to think that this year’s U.S. Open Champion, Bryson DeChambeau, who recently surpassed the 1 Million subscriber mark on YouTube, may have been a factor in tipping the scales of YouTube Golf being more widely recognized.\n\nImpacts and Future\n\nYouTube has undeniably revolutionized the way golf is perceived, learned, and enjoyed. The platform has empowered creators to share their love for the game, break down traditional barriers, and inspire a new generation of golfers. With influential figures like Rick Shiels, Grant Horvat, Bryson DeChambeau, the Bob Does Sports crew, and the team at Good Good leading the charge, the future of golf looks brighter, more inclusive, and more engaging than ever before. As content consumption continues to evolve, the role of YouTube in shaping the world of golf is set to grow even further, driving the sport toward new heights.\n\nYour Reaction?\n\nLIKE2\n\nLEGIT0\n\nWOW0\n\nLOL1\n\nIDHT0\n\nFLOP1\n\nOB1\n\nSHANK2\n\nIn 2016, at the Olympic Games in Rio, Golf’s reintroduction as an Olympic sport stood as a landmark moment in the game’s storied history, marking its evolving recognition and global importance. That development was not only significant in terms of the prestige it brings, but it crucially validates golf’s status as a sport that resonates across different cultures and geographies.\n\nBeing part of the Olympics magnifies golf’s global appeal. While the sport has long-standing traditions in countries like the United States, United Kingdom, and Japan, the Olympic Games expose it to a broader, more diverse audience. Countries where golf is not typically popular are more likely to take notice when their athletes compete on this grand stage. This visibility can spark interest and investment in the sport in regions previously untapped by golf’s reach.\n\nThe Olympic stage provides an unparalleled level of attention and viewership. Billions tune in to watch the Olympics, meaning millions who may have never watched a golf tournament are introduced to the sport. This exposure is invaluable for attracting new players, particularly young ones. For a sport often perceived as elitist or inaccessible, showcasing golf in the democratic, unifying context of the Olympics helps alter these stereotypes.\n\nThe Olympic spotlight helps emphasize the sheer athletic prowess required in golf. It highlights the focus, precision, and mental endurance necessary to excel, aligning golf with other sports celebrated for their physical demands. Golfers can now be recognized not just as skilled athletes within their own circles but as part of a broader community of world-class competitors.\n\nGolf’s Olympic inclusion also presents opportunities for countries to invest in developing their athletes. With the incentive of Olympic glory, nations are more likely to fund training programs, build facilities, and support golf associations dedicated to nurturing young talent. This, in turn, leads to higher competitive standards and a richer diversity of playing styles and personalities in the sport.\n\nThe return of golf to the Olympics—starting in 2016 after a 112-year hiatus—also provided seasoned professionals and emerging talents the opportunity to compete in a team dynamic distinct from traditional tournaments. Playing for one’s country adds a layer of passion and a sense of duty, often resulting in compelling performances that resonate deeply with fans.\n\nGolf’s inclusion in the Olympics bolsters its global presence, attracts diverse new audiences, and provides a platform to showcase the athletic demands of the sport. It injects fresh enthusiasm into the golfing world, inspiring nations to nurture their golfing talent, thus enriching the game’s global tapestry. This milestone symbolizes much more than a place in the competitions; it represents an expansive future for golf as a universally celebrated sport.\n\nAs John Bodenhamer, the USGA’s Chief Championships Officer and Board Chair for USA Golf, told me in an interview I conducted for RG.org,\n\n“Golf as part of the Olympic Games has and should continue to grow and inspire the game, especially as governments provide funding for the sport in their country to encourage medal-winning.\n\n“For golf to maintain its success on the Olympic stage, it is crucial to ensure that the best players participate, fans attend the on-site competition, and viewers across various media platforms tune in. These metrics are key to sustaining the sport’s relevance and appeal in the Olympic context.”\n\nWatching the golf competition at the Paris Olympics is a must if you are a fan of sports and competitions at the highest level. Whether it’s a replay of the Men’s competition or tuning in live this week for the Women, Olympic Golf promises thrilling action with top golfers from around the globe showcasing their skills on a world-class course. The strategic challenges and picturesque landscapes of Paris’s Le Golf National Golf Course offer an extra layer of excitement.\n\nWith the Olympics’ spirit of unity and excellence, the golf competition offers a unique opportunity to witness historical moments and intense yet friendly rivalries take place at an incredible venue. Whether you’re a seasoned golf fan or new to the sport, golf at the Paris Olympics is an unforgettable experience that combines athletic prowess, global representation, and a cultural celebration—all in the spirit of this ancient game we call golf.\n\nYour Reaction?\n\nLIKE2\n\nLEGIT2\n\nWOW0\n\nLOL1\n\nIDHT1\n\nFLOP2\n\nOB2\n\nSHANK2\n\nAnother Open Championship has come and gone and links golf was once again in the spotlight at Royal Troon! For those who have never played a links course (like myself), it sparks a desire to fly across the pond to experience it for ourselves. While a golf trip to the UK or Ireland is a bucket-list item, most people look to play the big-name courses (Old Course, Carnoustie, Lahinch, Royal Portrush,etc.), but don’t realize they can get a similar experience by traveling to some of the lesser known destinations where you will find some of the purest links courses in the world. With this in mind, here are our picks for the best hidden gem links courses you should play when you book a UK or Ireland trip:\n\nIRELAND\n\nBallyliffin\n\nWe start our list off with a 36-hole club in the Northwest of Ireland, a remote area of the Emerald Isle that is known for its rugged terrain and spectacular scenery. Bordering the Wild Atlantic Way, Ballyliffin is relatively newer (est. 1947) but offers golfers one of the purest links golf experiences anywhere in the country. While not easy to get to, the two courses onsite (Old and Glashedy) are well worth the travel with large dunes shaping the fairways that overlook the North Atlantic Ocean and a myriad of pot bunkers everywhere you look. Even Rory McIlroy believes that “Ballyliffin’s two courses are a must play on any golf trip to Ireland.” and we tend to agree.\n\nHow to incorporate Ballyliffin in a golf trip:\n\nStay:Ballyliffin Lodge, Hotel & Spa\n\nPlay: Old Links & Glashedy Links at Ballyliffin, and Old Tom Morris Links or Sandy Hills Course at Rosapenna\n\nEnniscrone\n\nThe next course on the list is in the Sligo area of the Northwest where we find Enniscrone, roughly 3 hours (by car) south of Ballyliffin. Like many links courses, Enniscrone was originally a 9-hole course when it was opened in 1918 before an additional 9 holes were added 12 years later. In 1970, Eddie Hackett was tasked with redesigning the course to help the two 9-hole courses flow effortlessly into one 18 hole layout. A big feature that can be seen throughout your round here are the towering dunes that shape the course and protect some holes from the ocean winds. Built right out of the landscape of the dunes bordering the sea, the course has a lot of undulation in the fairways and greens with some elevated tee boxes providing unreal views of the natural land.\n\nHow to incorporate Enniscrone in a golf trip:\n\nStay: The Glasshouse Hotel, Sligo\n\nPlay: Enniscrone, County Sligo, and Donegal\n\nAdditional Courses: Strandhill, Carne, and Narin & Portnoo\n\nSt. Patrick’s Links\n\nAnother fantastic gem on the Northwest coast of Ireland is the NEW (2020) St. Patricks Links at Rosapenna Hotel & Golf Links. The land was purchased back in 2012 which was already a 36-hole facility and Tom Doak was brought in to reimagine the property to the layout it currently is today. Large sand dunes shape the front 9 holes before heading back through some more subtle dunes back towards the clubhouse. The course offers elevation changes with some tee boxes sitting atop the dunes offering spectacular views of Sheephaven Bay and beyond. With two other courses and a fantastic hotel on property, this destination is all you could ever ask for.\n\nStay: Rosapenna Hotel & Golf Links\n\nPlay: St. Patrick’s Links, Sandy Hills Course , and Old Tom Morris Links (all at Rosapenna)\n\nIsland Club\n\nFor our last hidden gem in Ireland, we head 30 minutes north of the country’s capital, Dublin, to The Island Club. Built along rugged terrain and the highest sand dunes on the east coast of Ireland, the Island Club is situated on a small peninsula surrounded by water on three sides providing a difficult challenge, especially with the winds. Founded in 1890, the Island Club continues to be ranked in the Top 10 courses in Ireland and has held some Amateur Championships and Open Championship Regional Qualifiers.\n\nHow to incorporate The Island Club in a golf trip:\n\nStay: The Grand Hotel, Malahide\n\nPlay: Island Club, Portmarnock Old, County Louth\n\nAdditional Courses: Royal Dublin\n\nSCOTLAND\n\nDunbar\n\nLocated along “Scotland’s Golf Coast” of East Lothian is where we find the classic links of Dunbar. Opened in 1856 with only 15 holes, this is one of the many courses in Scotland that Old Tom Morris had a hand in crafting. Laid out along rocky and rocky terrain, the course is only 6500 yards long and while not long by modern standards, the course requires shot making and proper club selection to play well. The course has held many national and international tournaments including a few rounds of The Open Final Qualifying.\n\nHow to incorporate Dunbar in a golf trip:\n\nStay: No. 12 Hotel & Bistro\n\nPlay: Dunbar, Gullane (No.1), North Berwick\n\nAdditional Courses: Craigielaw, Kilspindie, Gullane (No.2, No. 3)\n\nCruden Bay\n\nThe next course on our list brings us to the Scottish Highlands, one of the lesser traveled destinations in Scotland, but still home to some amazing links courses including Cruden Bay! Located 25 miles north of Aberdeen on the east coast of the Highlands, Cruden Bay was opened in 1899, although history would indicate golf has been played at the property since 1791. Another Old Tom Morris design, the course is consistently ranked in the Top 25 of courses in Scotland and it is easy to see why. At only 6600 yards, it is relatively short, but the natural lay of the land provides elevation changes, punchbowl greens, and some large, 3-story high dunes that offer spectacular views for a classic links experience.\n\nHow to incorporate Cruden Bay in a golf trip:\n\nStay: Leonardo Hotel Aberdeen\n\nPlay: Cruden Bay, Trump International Links, Royal Aberdeen\n\nAdditional Courses: Murcar\n\nBrora\n\nWe head back to the Highlands just north of Dornoch to where we find Brora Golf Club. Similar to a lot of links courses, Brora opened as only 9 holes in 1891, but that only lasted for 9 years before an additional 9 was added in 1900 before a James Braid redesign in 1924. At just over 6200 yards, this is one of those courses that will make you appreciate links golf in Scotland with cattle and sheep roaming freely around the property. The course is a typical links routing with the front 9 going out and the back 9 coming back to the clubhouse. The defense of the course is the wind (naturally), but the greens are relatively small with pot bunkers standing guard to catch errant approach shots.\n\nHow to incorporate Brora in a golf trip:\n\nStay: Royal Golf Hotel, Dornoch\n\nPlay: Brora, Royal Dornoch – Struie & Championship\n\nAdditional Courses: Golspie, Tain\n\nNairn\n\nStaying in the Scottish Highlands, the last Scotland links gem on the list is just outside of Inverness at The Nairn Golf Club. The narrow fairways are fast and firm leading to decent sized, tricky greens that roll true, but are guarded by devious pot bunkers. The first seven holes play right along the water and with not a ton of elevation changes, spectacular views across the Moray Firth can be seen throughout the course. With fantastic course conditions throughout the season, this fantastic links is an absolute must-play when visiting the Highlands.\n\nHow to incorporate Nairn in a golf trip:\n\nStay: Kingsmills Hotel, Inverness\n\nPlay: Nairn, Castle Stuart (Cabot Highlands), Fortrose & Rosemarkie\n\nAdditional Courses: Nairn Dunbar, Moray\n\nGolfbreaks by PGA TOUR highly recommends you start planning your trip across the pond AT LEAST 12-18 months in advance in order to secure tee times and hotel rooms over the dates you desire. With more and more people taking up the game of golf, these bucket list trips have already become extremely popular and will continue to gain interest so make sure to start planning early!\n\nRELATED: Open Championship courses you can play (and when the best time to book is)\n\nEditor’s note: This article is presented in partnership with Golfbreaks.
