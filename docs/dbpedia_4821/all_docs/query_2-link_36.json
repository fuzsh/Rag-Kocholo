        "text": "STANFORD, 49\n\nNO ONE BETTER IN PAST 33: This season marks the 12th anniversary of Sun Devil freshman Alejandro Canizares winning the 2003 title, the 22nd anniversary of Todd Demsey winning the 1993 title, and the 32nd anniversary of Jim Carter winning the 1983 title. ASU has had four NCAA medalists on six occasions as Carter (1983), Phil Mickelson (1989, 1990, 1992), Demsey (1993), and Canizares (2003) all have taken home the trophy in the past 32 seasons. No other program can match the Sun Devils’ six NCAA champions since 1983, as only Oklahoma State (five), Illinois (two), Stanford (two), and UNLV (two) have had multiple winners in that time.\n\nTHE FORMAT: The 2015 NCAA Championships will see the team champion determined via match play for the seventh straight year, as 2009 was the first time the winner wasn’t awarded by total strokes since 1965. The top 15 teams after 54 holes of stroke play will advance for one additional day of stroke play to determine the top eight teams for match play competition and the 72-hole stroke play individual champion. The top eight teams after 72 holes of play will compete in match play quarterfinals and semifinals on June 2. The championship match is set for June 3. During the match-play portion, each match will be worth one point with all five players participating. The first team to win three points within the team match will win the match.\n\nRAHM RECIPIENT OF 2015 BEN HOGAN AWARD: The Arizona State junior is the recipient of the 2015 Ben Hogan Award, the most prestigious award in men’s college golf. Rahm, the No. 1 player in the World Amateur Golf Ranking and No. 2 in the Golfweek/Sagarin College Rankings, is the first Sun Devil to receive the award since its inception in 1990. With Rahm’s win, the Hogan Award winner has come from a Pac-12 school for four straight years (Patrick Cantlay, 2012; Chris Williams, 2013; Patrick Rodgers, 2014). This year’s finalists, also from the Pac-12, included Maverick McNealy (Stanford) and Cheng-Tsung Pan (Washington). This marked the first time that all three finalists played in the same conference.\n\nRAHM TIES FOR 5TH AT PHOENIX OPEN: Rahm’s 12-under 272 (70-68-66-68) at the Waste Management Open in late January fell just short of his quest to be the first amateur to win a PGA Tour event since Sun Devil Phil Mickelson won the Northern Telecom Open in 1991, but that certainly did not diminish what happened during the week. He hit 51 of 72 greens in regulation and had an average drive of more than 300 yards. The only amateur in the field of 132, the two-time honorable mention All-American had his way with the par-71, 7,266-yard TPC Scottsdale layout. He became the first amateur to finish in the top-five of a PGA TOUR event since Chris Wood (fifth) at the 2008 British Open and Justin Rose (tied for fourth) at the 1998 British Open.\n\nBEST NCAA SEASON STROKE AVERAGE\n\nMaverick McNealy, Stanford, 2014-15, 68.70\n\nJon Rahm, Arizona State, 2014-15, 68.78\n\nBill Haas, Wake Forest, 2003-04, 68.93\n\nRyan Moore, UNLV, 2004-05, 69.29\n\nHunter Stewart, Vanderbilt, 2014-15, 69.36\n\nRyan Moore, UNLV, 2003-04, 69.38\n\nPatrick Rodgers, Stanford, 2013-14, 69.41\n\nBryce Molder, Georgia Tech, 2000-01, 69.43\n\nOllie Schniederjans, Georgia Tech, 2013-14, 69.51\n\nMax Rottluff, Arizona State, 2014-15, 69.53\n\n#BACKTHEPAC: There are six teams from the Pac-12 going to the NCAA Championships, tied for the most of any conference, as Arizona State is joined by UCLA, Oregon, Stanford, USC, and Washington. Here is a conference breakdown for the 2015 NCAA Men’s Golf Championship.\n\nPAC-12 (6): Arizona State, Oregon, Stanford, UCLA, USC, Washington\n\nSEC (6): Auburn, Florida, South Carolina, Vanderbilt, LSU, Georgia\n\nACC (5): Clemson, Duke, Florida State, Georgia Tech, Virginia\n\nBIG 12 (5): Oklahoma, Oklahoma State, TCU, Texas, Texas Tech\n\nAMERICAN (3): Houston, SMU, South Florida\n\nCONFERENCE USA (2): Charlotte, UAB\n\nMOUNTAIN WEST (2): San Diego State, UNLV\n\nBIG TEN (1): Illinois\n\nSOME HISTORY: Arizona State made 19 straight appearances in the NCAA Championship from 1964-82 tied for the seventh-most consecutive appearances in NCAA history. Oklahoma State’s 65 leads the way from 1947-2011. ASU then went 18 years from 1984-2011 before missing the cut in 2012.\n\nBEST NCAA CHAMPIONSHIP CONSECUTIVE APPEARANCES\n\nOKLAHOMA STATE, 65 (1947-2011)\n\nHOUSTON, 36 (1952-87)\n\nCLEMSON, 23 (1982-2004)\n\nSTANFORD, 22 (1950-71)\n\nARIZONA, 21 (1987-2007)\n\nNORTH TEXAS, 21 (1947-67)\n\nARIZONA STATE, 19 (1964-82)\n\nPURDUE, 19 (1949-67)\n\nTEXAS, 19 (1979-97)\n\nUSC, 19 (1973-91)\n\nARIZONA STATE, 18 (1984-2011)\n\nWINS: ASU’s five wins this year are its most since the 1995-96 team won six on its way to the 1996 NCAA title. The only teams with more wins this year are Illinois (nine), Texas (seven), and South Florida (six).\n\nIT ISN’T EASY: ASU has made the NCAA Championship in the 11 of the past 14 seasons and 29 of past 32, but it sure isn’t getting easier with the 30-team, three-round six-regional format. Using Golfweek’s rankings heading into the regionals, nine top-30 teams are not going to Florida: North Carolina (18), Wake Forest (19), Alabama (20), Baylor (22), New Mexico (23), North Florida (26), Arkansas (27), California (28) and Kennessaw State (30).\n\nBEST SUN DEVIL MEN’S GOLF HEAD-TO-HEAD RECORDS\n\nSince head-to-head became an official statistic over a decade ago, ASU’s most wins prior to this year were in 2005-06 when it was 142-52-5. ASU is 158-16-1 entering NCAA Championship play after its second-place finish at NCAA Regionals in San Diego.\n\n2014-15: 158-16-1\n\n2005-06: 142-52-5\n\n2013-14: 130-54-4\n\nEAGLE UPDATE FOR RAHM: Jon Rahm now has 32 eagles in his 120-round career. How impressive is 32 eagles in 120 rounds? Dating back to 1993-94 when Golfstat started tracking college statistics, only three other Sun Devils posted 15 eagles in their careers. 2003 NCAA champion Alejandro Canizares had 15 eagles in 152 career rounds, while Scott Pinckey (121 rounds) and Niklas Lemke (151 rounds) had 16 eagles in their career.\n\nJON RAHM SEVEN TOURNAMENT WINS\n\nNCAA San Diego Regional (May14-16, 2015)\n\nASU Thunderbird Invitational (April 3-4, 2015)\n\nDuck Invitational (Mar. 23-24, 2015)\n\nBill Cullum Invitational (Oct. 20-21, 2014)\n\nASU Thunderbird Invitational (Mar. 21-23, 2014)\n\nSan Diego Classic (Mar. 11-12, 2013)\n\nBill Cullum Invitational (Oct. 21-22, 2012)\n\nMOST @ASUMENSGOLF TOURNAMENT WINS\n\nPhil Mickelson (1988-92), 16\n\nBilly Mayfair (1984-88), 8\n\nJon Rahm (2012-Present), 7\n\nAlejandro Canizares (2002-06), 6\n\nCharlie Gibson (1972-75), 6\n\nPaul Casey (1997-2000), 6\n\nRECENT ASU NCAA INDIVIDUAL TOP-10 FINISHES\n\nJohn Rahm (Fr.), T2/2013 (Atlanta, Ga.)\n\nJesper Kennegard (So.), T9th/2009 (Toledo, Ohio)\n\nAlejandro Canizares (Fr.) 1st/2003 (Stillwater, Okla.)\n\nChez Reavie (Jr.), 9th/2003 (Stillwater, Okla.)\n\nChez Reavie (Fr.), T4th/2001 (Durham, N.C.)\n\nPaul Casey (So.), 4th/1999 (Chaska, Minn.)\n\nDarren Angel (Jr.), T7th/1998 (Albuquerque, N.M.)\n\nScott Johnson (Sr.), T10th/1997 (Chicago, Ill.)\n\nChris Hanell (Sr.), T10th/1997 (Chicago, Ill.)\n\nDarren Angel (Fr.), T3rd/1996 (Chattanooga, Tenn.)\n\nJoey Snyder (Jr.), T5th/1995 (Columbus, Ohio)\n\nScott Johnson (So.), T8th/1995 (Columbus, Ohio)\n\nTodd Demsey (Jr.), T7th/1994 (Dallas, Texas)\n\nChris Hanell (Fr.), T10th/1994 (Dallas, Texas)\n\nTodd Demsey (So.), 1st/1993 (Lexington, Ky.)\n\nPhil Mickelson (Sr.), 1st/1992 (Albuquerque, N.M.)\n\nPhil Mickelson (Jr.), T4th/1991 (Pebble Beach, Calif.)\n\nPhil Mickelson (So.), 1st/1990 (Tarpon Springs, Fla.)\n\nPhil Mickelson (Fr.), 1st/1989 (Edmond, Okla.)\n\nBilly Mayfair (Sr.), T9th/1988 (Westlake Village, Calif.)\n\nJim Carter (Jr.), 1st/1983 (Fresno, Calif.)\n\nCHAMPS FROM THE PAC-12: Pac-12 teams ASU (1990, 1996), Cal (2004), Stanford (2007 and 1994) and UCLA (2008) have won NCAA men’s golf titles in the past 25 years.
