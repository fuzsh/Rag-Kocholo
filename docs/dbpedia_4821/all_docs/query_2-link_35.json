        "text": "A golf professional’s job was much different when Bill Ogden ran the shop at North Shore Country Club. Ogden not only could compete at the highest level, but he also was a master at handling the detail work that was required on the job.\n\nThe Chicago area never has had a club pro as widely successful as Ogden, and his myriad of accomplishments were recognized this week when he was named among eight inductees into the PGA Golf Professionals Hall of Fame. He’ll be inducted posthumously at PGA Village in Port St. Lucie, FL., on March 12.\n\nAs a competitor Ogden was the Illinois PGA Player-of-the-Year a record six times and the only golfer to win the Illinois Open, Illinois PGA Championship, IPGA Match Play title and IPGA Assistants crown.\n\nFrom 1953-72 Ogden won 31 of the section’s major titles and also competed effectively in PGA Tour events, gaining a tie for third in the 1956 Bing Crosby National Pro-Am and a tie for fourth in the 1968 Tucson Open.\n\nOgden was much more than a player, though. In his 40 years in charge at North Shore he became well known for grooming his assistants. Forty-three of them went on to land head jobs.\n\nIn 1970 Ogden was not only the IPGA president, he was also the section’s Professional-of-the-Year – and North Shore wasn’t exactly a full-time job for him. In the winters he was head professional at five different clubs in Palm Springs, Calif., between 1970 and 1980.\n\nOgden was the man among Illinois pros when I came on the golf-writing scene here in 1971. He retired from North Shore shortly after that and lived in California until his death at age 78 in 2005.\n\nNU goes for a four-peat\n\nIllinois, ranked 17th in the national collegiate polls, is the top-seeded team for the fifth straight year in the Big Ten Match Play Championships, which begin Friday at the Jack Nicklaus-designed Concession course in Bradenton, FL.\n\nThe Illini, though, have never won the league’s Match Play event. Northwestern has dominated, winning the last three titles. The Wildcats are the second-best Big Ten team in the national rankings, standing 29th.\n\nKemperSports adds Harborside\n\nKemperSports manages a wide variety of golf facilities in 26 states as well as internationally. Now the Northbrook-based firm will take on one of Chicago’s premier public facilities, 36-hole Harborside International.\n\nHarborside, designed by Dick Nugent, was one of the first golf facilities created on what had been a landfill. Its development was a big boost for the far South Side, and now it’ll get the Kemper touch.\n\n“We plan to introduce a variety of new programs at Harborside to cater to the residents of Chicago and surrounding areas,’’ said Kemper chief executive officer Steve Skinner. “We look forward to elevating the service, playing conditions and guest experience to make Harborside a must-play for Chicago golfers and visitors to the city.’’\n\nWadkins featured at Chicago Golf Show\n\nWorld Golf Hall of Famer Lanny Wadkins will take over center stage on the second day of the 30th Chicago Golf Show, which comes to the Stephens Convention Center in Rosemont from Feb. 22-24.\n\nWadkins was just named as lead analyst for Champions Tour telecasts on The Golf Channel and he’ll be in Chicago to promote the new Encompass Championship, which comes to North Shore June 21-23. That event will mark the first Champions Tour stop in Chicago since 2002 when Harborside hosted.\n\nORLANDO, FL. – The Ladies PGA Tour is returning to Chicago – but it won’t be until 2016. And then it will be for the staging of an extraordinary new team event.\n\nMike Whan, the LPGA commissioner, highlighted the first day of the 60th PGA Merchandise Show by announcing the arrival of the International Crown event. It’ll make its debut July 21-27 at Caves Valley, a Tom Fazio design in Owings Mills, Md., and the second staging will be in the summer of 2016 at Rich Harvest Farms in Sugar Grove.\n\nJerry Rich, owner and designer of the Rich Harvest private facility that hosted the 2009 Solheim Cup matches, was a leader in making the new event happen.\n\n“Three days after Mike became commissioner (in 2010)_ I brought him to Chicago and said we’ve got to do something special,’’ said Rich. “The greatest players aren’t just from America. They’re from Asia and around the world.’’\n\nThat started the planning process that led to Thursday’s announcement before a standing-room-only press conference at the Orange County Convention Center.\n\nRich Harvest’s Solheim Cup was a rousing success, but didn’t lead to the return of an LPGA annual stop to Chicago. The LPGA has only sporadically staged tournaments on Chicago courses, the last being the Kellogg-Keebler Classic at Stonebridge, in Aurora, in 2004.\n\nThat tourney had a three-year run in the aftermath of the U.S. Women’s Open being played at Merit Club in Libertyville in 2000. Karrie Webb won at Merit Club and at the last Kellogg-Keebler with Annika Sorenstam dominating at Stonebridge in 2002 and 2003.\n\nThe International Crown, though, will top all those and might well rival the success of the Solheim with the top players world-wide guaranteed to compete.\n\n“At the Solheim Cup (of 2009) we had the largest event (the LPGA) ever had,’’ said Rich. “We had 120,000 people in Chicago – the greatest golf city in the world. Maybe this (new) event won’t approach the Ryder Cup that we just had at Medinah, but it will be huge.’’\n\nRich probably could have hosted the 2014 International Crown, but decided against it.\n\n“I needed four years to wait because of our junior programs,’’ said Rich. His staff has studied the nearly 2,000 high school girls programs in five states. Those players, along with college players, will be invited to the International Crown with lodging already being arranged at Northern Illinois University and Aurora College.\n\nThe International Crown will present a different type of competition and have a broader world-wide appeal than the LPGA’s previous tries at one-week individual championships here. Whan predicted the event will “take women’s golf to the next level and allow fans to rally behind their homelands.’’\n\nThe International Crown will be held in even-numbered years to avoid conflict with the Solheim Cup. It’ll feature 32 players from eight countries battling to determine, according to the LPGA, “the world’s best golf nation.’’\n\nCompetition will be over four days, three for best-ball matches and one for singles matches. Teams will be determined by the top four players on the Rolex World Rankings after the 2013 CME Group Titleholders event, the last tourney of the LPGA season. If the International Crown were to be held now the eight teams participating would be South Korea, the U.S., Japan, Sweden, Australia, Taiwan, Spain and England.\n\nThe four players who will compete for each country when the competition begins will be determined at a later date.\n\n“Our tour is so global, we need this type of an event,’’ said Stacey Lewis, the top-ranked American player. “People always want to know why golfers from Asia are so good. Now we can see how all the countries stack up.’’\n\nTaiwan’s long-time world No. 1 player, Yani Tseng, likened the lead-in to the International Crown to “preparing for the Olympics.’’ The Rich Harvest version of the International Crown will about a month before the Olympics in Brazil, when golf will make its return to the Games.\n\nThe first International Crown event will offer a $1.6 million purse with each member of the winning team receiving $100,000. Ambassadors and financial supporters will be announced at a later date as will the nature of the trophy going to the winning nation\n\nORLANDO, FL. – The 60th annual PGA Merchandise Show teed off with a massive Demo Day on Wednesday but Chicago club manufacturer Tour Edge got a jump on the opposition a day early.\n\nThe Batavia-based company, in its eighth annual Multi-Manufacturers Media Day outing at the Legacy Club, introduced its first variable-fit driver. It was just one in a line of new products unveiled by Tour Edge president David Glod, but it drew the most attention.\n\nTour Edge isn’t the first company to test variable-fit clubs. Putter manufacturers were the first to do it, and now it’s spreading throughout the industry.\n\nWith Tour Edge’s Exotic line of clubs (shown above) a players can change the loft, face angle and shaft.\n\n“You have options at your fingertips,’’ said Glod, who founded his company in 1986. “We’re planning on having an adjustable fairway wood, too, but it’s too net yet. It makes more sense with the driver.’’\n\nGlod accepts the trend toward such state-of-the-art equipment and believes it’ll be around for awhile.\n\n“It’s a great technology,’’ he said, “but it depends on the consumer. The guy who studies the game gets it. That’s why it’s been sticking around.’’\n\nTraining devices are also getting increasingly high-tech. Sky Golf, a pioneer in developing electronic yardage books with its Sky Caddie, now also offers Sky Pro – a swing analyzer that the company bills as “one of the most exciting products in golf today.’’ Many more were on display, in a series of colorful displays (pictured above), at the Demo Day lead-in to the PGA Merchandise show.\n\nSwing Jacket, which isn’t so high-tech, is back on the market after a fire burned down its production facility in China. A player wears the tight-fitting jacket on the practice range and instructor Dave Brisbee says that player’s swing “can’t get out of position….It constrains range of motion to affect a better swing.’’\n\nAnd then there’s Polara, a company not reluctant to admit that it’s equipment is usually “non-conforming’’ with the rules of the U.S. Golf Assn.\n\nPolara drew plenty of attention with its no-slice golf balls. Now president David Felker said Polara is going into wedges, the first of which will be on the market before the year it out. Polara says its wedges “will help the ball spin more,’’ and Felker admits “it’s very unlikely’’ that they will conform to USGA specifications.\n\nStill, the company believes it’s helping golf grow by making it an easier game for the estimated 85 percent of players who don’t carry USGA handicaps. To that end Polara is joining forces with the new Recreational Golf Assn. of America to push its products with more casual golfers.\n\nThe big show has plenty of golfers of all shades of interest. Over 40,000 will attend the three days of exhibits at the orange County Convention Center. Attendees will come from about 75 countries and walk down 10 miles of show alleys to check out the products of more than 1,000 manufacturers and brands.\n\nWednesday’s Demo Day, held at the Orange County National Golf Center in Winter Garden, drew out over 100 manufacturers. The Center has a circular range with 200 hitting bays spread over a 42-acre practice facility.\n\nAll the top manufacturers, including Chicago-based Wilson Sporting Good and Tour Edge, had the wares on display at Demo Day. So did other major manufacturers Bridgestone, Callaway Cleveland/Srixon, Cobra Puma, Mizuno, Nike, Ping, TaylorMade and Titleist.\n\nStars players past and president will also be making appearances, among them Davis Love III, Annika Sorenstam, Ian Poulter, Luke Donald, Lexi Thompson, Lee Trevino and Nancy Lopez. Ricky Fowler had a big presence — or at least his hat did. An enlarged replica of Fowler’s orange headgear enticed lots of picture takers — even though Fowler wasn’t there.\n\nThe Chicago Golf Show will get a big boost for its 30th anniversary staging next month.\n\nRarely has the show, to be held Feb. 22-24 at the Stephens Convention Center in Rosemont, had a presenting sponsor. The last time the Show was so blessed was in 2009, when South Carolina golf mecca Myrtle Beach took the leadership role.\n\nThis time the show will be presented by the BMW Championship, the Western Golf Association’s premier event. If ever there was a win-win situation in golf, this is it. The show needed a high profile link with the PGA Tour, and the BMW Championship has to rekindle interest among Chicago golfers. They didn’t get to see the FedEx Cup playoff event last year – it was held in Indianapolis – and it’ll have a new course for its return to Chicago in September.\n\nSince 1991 the tourney used Cog Hill in Lemont as its Chicago home. This year it’ll be staged Sept. 9-15 at Conway Farms, a private facility in Lake Forest.\n\n“We’ve always had a booth at the Show,’’ said Vince Pellegrino, the WGA’s tournament director, “but this year we thought we should take a more active role. We’re in an educational process, and we’ll do everything we can to create awareness. This is another vehicle for us to spread the word about the BMW going to Conway Farms.’’\n\nShow visitors (usually numbering around 20,000) will find BMW Championship promotional material prominently displayed when they walk through the doors Feb. 22-24 and the first 200 will receive two free tickets to practice rounds for the tourney proper.\n\nThe WGA, which raises money for college scholarships for caddies, has found it profitable to move the BMW Championship to golf-starved locations in alternate years and last year underscored the wisdom of doing that. The 2012 BMW, at Crooked Stick, was named the PGA Tour’s Tournament of the Year.\n\nWhile most the WGA’s PGA Tour events have been held in Chicago since the first Western Open of 1899, the event will take on a new look in 2013. Conway Farms, the home course of tour star Luke Donald, has never hosted a PGA Tour event.\n\n“In changing locations we’ve had to start from scratch,’’ said Pellegrino. “We’ve been working with (officials from) the city of Lake Forest and Lake County for several months. They’ve been extremely engaged with us, and we’re very pleased with the support we’ve received.’’\n\nMetamora Fields gets IPGA’s last major\n\nThe Illinois PGA will make a major tournament change. The section’s last major, on Sept. 30 and Oct. 1, won’t be held at Eagle Ridge Resort in Galena – its long-time home base – in 2013.\n\nInstead, the event will shift to Metamora Fields, a new course in Peoria. Metamora Fields opened in July, 2011. The layout was designed by PGA Tour veteran D.A. Weibring and his lead architect, Steve Wolfard. Weibring, who grew up in Quincy and went to college at Illinois State, was the 1987 Western Open champion. His design work includes TPC Deere Run, the site of the PGA Tour’s annual John Deere Classic – a tourney that Weibring also won during his days on the circuit.\n\nA longer Western Amateur\n\nThe WGA, which will conduct four championships for the first time in 2013, is altering the format of its tradition-rich Western Amateur.\n\nNot only will the Western Am move out of Chicago for the first time in five years, it’ll also get a new format. No longer will there be a 36-hole session for the low 44 and ties after the first two rounds of the 72-hole stroke play qualifying.\n\nThe July 29-Aug. 4 tourney was moved to the Alotian Club in Arkansas, a move Pellegrino said was made to take advantage of “a unique opportunity to go to a very exclusive place.’’\n\nTemperatures figure to be higher in Arkansas than they’ve been in Chicago, so now the field will be play 18 holes Tuesday-Friday with the top 16 players settling the title in two days of match play after that. That means the competition will be spread over six days instead of five.\n\n“The Alotian Club isn’t like Exmoor or North Shore (Chicago courses that hosted the last two Western Ams). Those courses were easy to walk. The Alotian Club is a challenge to walk, with a lot of undulation. It’ll be an endurance test.’’\n\nPellegrino expects the old format to be in place when the tournament resumes its Chicago rotation in 2014.\n\nDid you know?\n\nX—Two more Chicago private clubs will have new head professionals this season. Assistant Brian Brown moved up at Naperville, replacing the retired Jim Arendt, and Brandon Adair is moving from Prestwick to take over at Midlothian.\n\nX – Northbrook-based KemperSports has received another honor. It was named Club Management Company of the Year by BoardRoom magazine. Kemper added four private facilities to its portfolio in 2012 – Rockledge in Florida, Quail Lodge in California, Andover in Kentucky and Victory Ranch in Utah. The award will be presented at the Club Managers Assn. of America World Conference in San Diego next month.\n\nX – Northwestern women’s coach Emily Fletcher has landed another prize recruit. Minji Luo, the California high school champion, will enroll at NU in the fall. She qualified for both the U.S. Women’s Amateur and U.S. Girls Junior Amateur in 2012.\n\nIT ZIEHMS TO ME: New pros for Medinah, Exmoor; Eskimo celebrates 50th anniversary\n\nMike Scully ended a 10-year stint as Medinah Country Club’s director of golf as soon as the Ryder Cup ended. Now the club has selected his replacement.\n\nMarty DeAngelo will take over Scullly’s former position on Jan. 21. Like Scully he comes to Medinah from Florida, where he had been director of golf at Isleworth – the home club for Tiger Woods and several other PGA Tour players.\n\nAlso like Scully, DeAngelo had deep roots in Chicago before going to Medinah. DeAngelo earned his Class A status with the PGA of America after working as an apprentice at Deer Park.\n\nUnlike Scully, DeAngelo comes with a solid background as a tournament player. He has played in tournaments on the Canadian PGA, Hooters, Ben Hogan and PGA circuits.\n\nDeAngelo is ending a long run at Isleworth to come to Medinah. He started working at the Florida facility in 1995, became head professional in 1998 and director of golf in 2004. In 2007 he was named Private Merchandiser of the Year by the Florida chapter of the PGA and he also serves on the Florida Special Olympics board.\n\nScully left Medinah to become director of golf at Desert Mountain, a resort facility in Scottsdale, Ariz., that boasts five 18-hole courses.\n\nAnother long-established Chicago private facility, Exmoor in Highland Park, also dipped into the Florida ranks for its next head professional. David Schmaltz was hired by the club that hosted the Western Amateur in 2012 after having worked as an assistant at Jupiter Club.\n\nA major milestone for the Eskimo Open\n\nThe Northern Illinois Men’s Amateur Golf Assn. organized a January event for its most diehard members. It was played at times in a foot of snow (I know. I was one of the participants back in the 1970s when my late brother Rich and I played in the Eskimo 10 straight years when Buffalo Grove Golf Club was the site).\n\nDespite some challenging weather conditions over the years as well as some course and organizational changes, the Eskimo Open has lived on and this year’s staging on Jan. 6 over the Nos. 1 or 3 courses at Cog Hill will mark the event’s 50th anniversary.\n\nRegistration begins on Monday, Dec. 31. Fees, payable on the day of play, are $42. Carts, if available, will cost an additional $16. A chili lunch, beverages and prizes are also included.\n\nThe event will be held over 18 holes with tee times ranging from 7-11 a.m. If there’s snow a nine-hole division will be also available.\n\nDid you know?\n\nX — Northbrook-based KemperSports has opened a well-publicized Florida resort, Streamsong, and taken over the management of one of the Sunshine State’s older private facilities, Rockledge Country Club. Both are located near Orlando.\n\nX – Cantigny, in Wheaton, will begin offering 75-minute fitness workshops twice a month starting on Jan. 8. They’ll be directed by Dr. Paul Callaway.\n\nX – Tickets to the Feb. 24-26 Chicago Golf Show at the Stephens Convention Center in Rosemont will be on sale at reduced rates through Jan. 6. Purchasers can get four tickets to the show for $25 until that date.\n\nX –Chicago’s Wilson Sporting Goods has re-signed Irish star Padraig Harrington to another multi-year contract. The winner of three major championships, Harrington will again play Wilson clubs on both the PGA and European PGA tours. He started with Wilson in 1998.\n\nAfter reading “King of Clubs: The Great Golf Marathon of 1938’’ I felt there was a message to be delivered about how bad slow play has gotten.\n\nVirginia-based sports writing veteran Jim Ducibella recounts the story of J. Smith Ferebee, a Chicago stockbroker and Olympia Fields Country Club member who was briefly in the national spotlight for his bid to play 600 holes of golf in eight cities over four consecutive days.\n\nThink about this. Seven decades ago Ferebee played more than 33 rounds of golf in 96 hours and never shot 100. Had he hit triple digits he would have lost the bet that started his whole ordeal, and Ferebee did post 99 in one round. Most of his scores were in the 80s, however, and he was playing on many courses – located from Los Angeles to New York – that he’d never seen before.\n\nTo put the feat in better perspective, Ferebee would play at least 144 holes per day, keeping a very brisk pace between each shot. There were no golf carts involved, and Ferebee had to tee up his drives and take the ball from each cup after he putted out. Those were the terms of the bet.\n\nThen he’d board a plane, with an entourage that included a doctor, caddie and publicist among others, and fly to the next stop to do it all again. I recall twice playing 45 holes in a day, walking all in the second, in tours of the five Chicago Park District nine-hole courses. Those tours were organized by KemperSports in the early 1990s. They were a lot of fun, as a few media friends would get van transportation between each course.\n\nPlaying that much golf in a day that started at dawn at the Marovitz course on Lake Michigan and finished at dusk at Columbus Park was considered a noteworthy back then – at least by us – but we had nothing on J.Smith Ferebee. In one stretch he played 144 holes in 15 hours 7 minutes and averaged 86 for every 18 holes. In that time he walked an estimated 40 miles. I’m staggered by it all.\n\nOlympia Fields, his home club, had four courses back then including one (now known as the North course) that has hosted two U.S. Opens and two PGA Championships. Ferebee played those four courses in the middle of his marathon in 89, 83, 85 and 89. All of the courses he played were short by today’s standards, but hardly of the pitch-and-putt variety.\n\nAnyway, with all due respect to my Big-3 partner – golf historian extraordinaire Tim Cronin – Ducibella’s “King of Clubs’’ deserves a place in Chicago’s golf history archives. It is much more than a recounting of a whacky pre-World War II publicity stunt. Ducibella tells me that very few people (including the current membership and staff at Olympia Fields) knew much – if anything – about Ferebee.\n\nThat’s surprising, given that Ferebee’s quest to complete his marathon was closely followed by media outlets throughout the country. In Chicago his adventure shared the spotlight with a late-season charge by the Cubs to the National League pennant.\n\nPerhaps Ferebee’s moment in the spotlight was simply a reflection of another, most colorful, era in the history of Chicago sports. Still, it makes for most interesting reading. I heartily recommend this book, published by Potomac Books of Dulles, Va.\n\nBMW, JDC tourneys honored by PGA\n\nThe PGA Tour gave glowing reports to its 2012 tournaments with Illinois connections. The BMW Championship, conducted by the Western Golf Assn., was selected as the circuit’s Tournament of the Year and the John Deere Classic received the Most Engaged Community Award.\n\nIn 2012 the BMW raised $3.1 million for the Evans Scholars Foundation and was one of the top-attended tournaments of the year. The crowd count for the week at Crooked Stick in Indianapolis in September was 143,000 – a good reason for the WGA to continue its recent policy of moving its biggest event out of Chicago every other year.\n\nThe WGA took the event to Bellerive, in St. Louis, in 2008. The BMW Championship was also the PGA Tour’s Tournament of the Year that time.\n\nWinning the Most Engaged Community Award isn’t anything new for the JDC, held annually at TPC Deere Run in the Quad Cities. The JDC previously won the award in 2008 and 2011. This year’s event showed a 12 percent increase in ticket sales, a 27 percent increase in money raised through its Birdies for Charity campaign and a record $6.79 million windfall for 493 local charities. That amount was raised from more than 20,000 individual donors.\n\nDid you know?\n\nTwo Chicago golf leaders of a few decades back passed away with a month of each other recently. Nat Rosasco was owner and president of Northwestern Golf Co., a prominent equipment manufacturer, and Charles Chudek was the founder of Chicagoland Golfer, a twice-a-week publication that flourished in the early 1960s. Chudek’s publication is not to be confused with Chicagoland Golf, which operated under the late Phil Kosin from 1989-2009. Rosasco was 83, Chudek 82.\n\n+ + +\n\nThe University of Illinois’ Luke Guthrie played in only 10 events on the Web.com Tour this year after using up his collegiate eligibility, but he was one of three finalists for the circuit’s player-of-the-year award. It went to money-leader Casey Wittenberg through a vote of tour members. Guthrie, second on the money list, is headed for the PGA Tour in 2013.\n\n+ + +\n\nThe NCAA announced its postseason sites for 2014 and 2015. Rich Harvest Farms was awarded a men’s regional, with Northern Illinois the host school, in 2014.\n\nRarely does a Chicago golfer get through a qualifying school for any of the professional tours. This year, though, two did – and their roads to success couldn’t be much more different.\n\nWilmette’s Eric Meierdierks, a 27-year old with only one PGA start to his credit, made it all the way to the PGA Tour for 2013 with his tie for 14th finish in the three-stage November elimination that started with 1,558 players.\n\nBerwyn’s Nicole Jeray, 42, competed in the qualifying tournament for the LPGA Tour for the 19th time. It had 122 finalists, and she finished tied for 17th . That 90-hole competition ended earlier this week.\n\nMeierdierks, though relatively new to the rigorous qualifying procedures, made it easily. The top 25 and ties qualified for PGA Tour cards at PGA West in LaQuinta, Calif. A week later Jeray survived in dramatic fashion at LPGA International in Daytona Beach, FL. Only the top 20 get LPGA cards in that circuit’s Q-School, and Jeray had to go to a seven-player playoff for the final four spots. She survived with a 20-foot birdie putt on the fifth extra hole.\n\nThe first PGA Tour event for Meierdierks as a card-carrying member of the circuit will likely be the Sony Open in Hawaii on Jan. 7. Jeray has been on and off the LPGA circuit since earning privileges for the first time in 1994. She won’t make her full-fledged LPGA return until at least February, since that’s when the circuit begins play in 2013.\n\nMeierdierks arrival on the PGA Tour was a feel-good story, just as much as Jeray’s grittiness was on the women’s side. He had been basically a mini-tour player since turning professional in 2009. His career highlight had been a victory in the 2010 Illinois Open at Hawthorn Woods, and he lost that tourney’s 2012 title in a playoff with Max Scodro last August at The Glen Club.\n\nSix days before the first stage of this fall’s Q-School Meierdierks suffered a family tragedy. His father Dick, who had been in poor health after developing an infection following surgery, passed away at the age of 70. Making it through the first stage may have been Meierdierks’ toughest test in the qualifying process.\n\nFond memories of his father, however, played a role in Meierdierks’ success in the final stage, played over the Tournament and Nicklaus courses at PGA West.\n\n“We had stayed in Palm Springs on spring vacations,’’ he said, “and I distinctly remembered one year.’’\n\nThat was when the family’s lodging was off the seventh hole of the Nicklaus’ layout. It was understandable he’d remember that, given an incident that happened to his father there when he and Eric went out on the course to play a few holes late in the day.\n\n“He walked through a screen door and tore his patella tendon,’’ recalled Meierdierks. That misfortune aside, good family memories helped Meierdierks cope with the tension that always plays a part in Q-School. By the time his 90-hole marathon was over Meierdierks was set for the next stage in his golfing life.\n\n“It’s been incredible,’’ he told me after a few days of reflection. “It’s been a long journey, and it feels really good to finally have a dream come true and see a lot of hard work pay off.’’\n\nExcept for caddie and boyhood friend Bill Bohr, Meierdierks winged in alone during the final stage of Q-School. His mother Linda debated coming after Eric moved into contention, but decided to stay in Chicago.\n\n“She didn’t want to change the mojo that was going on in my week,’’ he said, “though I’m not sure it would have made any difference. Anyway, she’ll be able to see me play lots of tournaments now.’’\n\nMeierdierks, who has spent considerable time in Arizona “chasing the money on mini-tours’’ the last two years, planned a return to Illinois for two weeks during Christmas. Then he’ll be off on a new adventure. His only previous PGA Tour event was the 2009 Frys.com Open. He made it into the field through Monday qualifying but didn’t survive the 36-hole cut.\n\n“I didn’t play particularly bad,’’ he said. “It was mainly a learning experience, and it was very eye-opening. I had placed the players on the PGA Tour on such a high pedestal, but I realized then that they weren’t that far away. It was a really big step for me. I also saw how well they were treated out there.’’\n\nNow Meierdierks will find that out more frequently. He expects to get into quite a few early-season events, and his play will dictate how much he plays as the year progresses. Bohr, who carried his bag in all three stages of Q-School, will remain his caddie. They grew up together as caddies at Sunset Ridge, though Meierdierks went to high school at New Trier and Bohr at Loyola.\n\nHis equipment sponsorship, with TaylorMade, isn’t a concern and he feels prepared for what’s ahead the next few months.\n\n“I could see (at Q-School) that the PGA Tour is a massive organization, and it has a lot of people in place to help you through this process,’’ said Meierdierks. “There’s going to be a little lifestyle change, but mainly I figure I’ll be paying a little more taxes.’’\n\nJeray has been the only Chicago player on the LPGA Tour for the last two decades. The last Chicago player to earn privileges on the PGA Tour was Crystal Lake’s Joe Affrunti, who earned his card by finishing in the top 25 on the Nationwide (now Web.com Tour) money list in 2010. He required shoulder surgery last spring and missed most of what would have been his rookie season on the PGA Tour. Coming off a medical exemption, he hopes to resume playing on the circuit in 2013.\n\nPGA Tour qualifying school hasn’t been kind to the few Illinois golfers who have tried it over the years, but that wasn’t the case this week.\n\nEric Meierdierks, the 2010 Illinois Open champion from Wilmette, and Scott Langley, the 2010 NCAA champion for the University of Illinois, both earned their PGA Tour cards during the six-round marathon that concluded at PGA West in LaQuinta, Calif., on Monday.\n\nMeierdierks, a New Trier High School graduate who didn’t play golf in college at Michigan State, followed his Illinois Open win of two years ago at Hawthorn Woods with a playoff loss to Chicago’s Max Scodro in this year’s championship at The Glen Club, in Glenview. Meierdierks, who turned pro in 2009, has spent most of his time since then on the Gateway Tour in Arizona but he did return for his state’s premier championship.\n\nSince turning pro he also had a Gateway win to his credit, but he also had to deal with personal issues in getting through Q-School. His father passed away six days before the first stage of the competition.\n\n“That was the hardest tournament I ever played,’’ Meierdierks offered after the battle for his card ended successfully. “It made (the final stage) a walk in the park.’’\n\nHe also had good vibes as he toured the TPC Stadium Course and Nicklaus Tournament Course, the 18-holers at PGA West used for the qualifying rounds. Meierdierks’ family had vacationed off the No. 7 fairway of the Nicklaus’ course, and his glimpses of the lodging there triggered good memories for him in the heat of the competition.\n\nThis year’s Q-School – the last one to send players directly to the PGA circuit – had 1,558 registrants. There was a pre-qualifier and then three stages of eliminations before the top 25 and ties were awarded PGA playing privileges. Mierdierks tied for 14th, and Langley tied for 17th. Low man over the six tense rounds was Dong-hwan Lee, at 25—under-par. Mierdierks was at 20-under and Langley was another stroke back.\n\nAlso making it was Kris Blanks, the winner of the last Chicago area Nationwide (now Web.com Tour) tournament – the Bank of America Open at The Glen Club in 2008. Blanks earned a return trip to the PGA circuit. A shoulder injury had led to his failure to reach money-winning standards necessary to retain membership this year.\n\nAnother plus for the Illini\n\nLangley’s arrival on the PGA Tour was just the latest in major accomplishments for University of Illinois alums. Five will play on the PGA Tour in 2013, with Langley joining Steve Stricker, D.A. Points, Luke Guthrie and Joe Affrunti. Affrunti is still recovering from major shoulder surgery last spring.\n\nLike Langley, Guthrie will be a PGA Tour rookie. He qualified for the big tour by finishing second on the Web.com Tour money list – and he needed only 10 tournaments to do it. Guthrie didn’t turn pro until the Illinois season was over in June. Interestingly, Meierdierks’ Illinois Open win came in a duel with Guthrie.\n\nLangley’s advancement was no surprise. In addition to winning his NCAA title the left-handed golfer was a factor in the last two U.S. Opens. He tied for 16th in 2011 and tied for 19th this year.\n\nIllinois’ run of success hasn’t been without a cost. Coach Mike Small lost his assistant coach when Zach Guthrie, Luke’s brother, resigned that post. He’ll be Luke’s caddie on the PGA circuit in 2013.\n\nThey didn’t make it\n\nThose who didn’t crack the top 25 (actually 26 earned turn cards) at PGA West included Camilo Villegas, Heath Slocum Billy Mayfair, Nick O’Hern, Skip Kendall, former Northwestern star Chris Wilson, ex-British Open winner Todd Hamilton and Patrick Cantlay, who dazzled the PGA Tour when he shot a 60 as an amateur in the 2011 Travelers Championship.\n\nNext year’s Q-School will only offer spots on the Web.com Tour. That circuit will play a bigger role in determining who advances to the big circuit. This year the top 25 on that tour’s money list was promoted to the PGA Tour for 2013.\n\nAnybody who follows the golf scene in Illinois should tune in to what happens the next few days in the final stage of the PGA Tour’s Qualifying School at PGA West in California.\n\nWilmette’s Eric Mierdierks, winner of the 2010 Illinois Open at Hawthorn Woods and runnerup (in a playoff) to Chicago’s Max Scodro at The Glen Club in 2012, hit the halfway point in the six-round marathon in a tie for ninth place. The top 25 and ties after the six rounds earn berths on the PGA Tour for 2013.\n\nMierdierks, 27, has never played in a PGA Tour event. A New Trier High School graduate, he developed his skills playing on Arizona’s Gateway Tour the past few years, and his game appears to be peaking at the right time.\n\nThe PGA Tour Qualifying School will be radically transformed in 2013. This is the last year its top players will earn berths for the following year on the PGA circuit, and Mierdierks wants to take advantage of what might be a last-chance opportunity. Q-School will offer only spots on the Web.com Tour in 2013. That means it’ll be even harder to get on golf’s premier circuit, and it’s plenty difficult already.\n\nMierdierks was one of 1,558 players submitting entries to the 2012 Q-School, which is being conducted in three stages. This final stage, still in progress, began with 172 players battling for the coveted PGA Tour spots. Through the first three rounds Mierdierks is at 203, and five strokes behind leader Meen Whee Kim. Mierdierks shot 66-67 in rounds 2 and 3 on Thursday and Friday over the Nicklaus Tournament Course and TPC Stadium Course to climb the leaderboard.\n\nSaturday, Sunday and Monday rounds remain before playing privileges are determined. Most of the finalists will get privileges of some sort on the Web.com Tour in 2013 but, of course, the PGA spots are more coveted.\n\nThe last of the very few Chicago area players to earn a PGA Tour card was Crystal Lake’s Joe Affrunti. He earned his in 2010 by finishing in the top 25 on the Nationwide Tour money list. Affrunti, like Mierdierks, was an Illinois Open champion (2004) and also won the Chicago District Amateur in both 2000 and 2001. His PGA Tour hopes, however, have been hampered by a shoulder injury that required surgery.\n\nMierdierks won his Illinois Open title with a one-shot win over Luke Guthrie, the University of Illinois star who made it to the PGA Tour in a hurry. Making good use of some sponsor exemptions, he was a smash hit on both the PGA Tour and Web.com Tour in the second half of the 2012 season.\n\nKemperSports update\n\nKemperSports, the Northbrook-based golf management firm, continues to build a broad impact world-wide. Its latest project is the Vista Mar Golf & Beach Resort in Panama, and the soon-to-open 36-hole Streamsong Resort in Polk County, FL., has already received rave reviews in various golf publications.\n\nScott Wilson has been named director of golf at Streamsong. He had been at another KemperSports location, Vellano Country Club in California.\n\nOn the more local front, Nate Mather is leaving his job as general manager of Glen Flora Country Club in Waukegan to become GM of The Club at Fairvue Plantation in Gallatin, Tenn. – another KemperSports facility.\n\nFor the record\n\nHopefully this is the end of media reports suggesting Oak Brook’s Butler National might return as a big-tournament venue. Some club members would like the exposure Butler received as site of the Western Open from 1974-1990, but the vast majority want it to remain all-male and therefore not acceptable for U.S. Golf Assn. and PGA events. A vote was taken on the issue recently and my sources tell me only one or two members wanted to accept female members. Until that sentiment changes Butler as a tournament site is a non-issue.\n\nJust my opinion\n\nThis joint announcement by the U.S. Golf Assn. and Royal & Ancient Golf Club banning the anchoring putting stroke isn’t that big a deal. Of course, anchoring a club against your body should be banned. It represents too big a departure from golf’s traditions. Royal & Ancient likely felt stronger about this issue than the USGA did, and the rule proposal was too long in coming.\n\nAnd don’t forget, long putters (the belly variety and the longer “broom-handle’’) are still legal. That’s fine by me, though I suspect there’ll be some controversies over just what is anchoring and what isn’t once the rule is put into effect in 2016. How close to your body does the club have to be to be considered “anchoring?’’ Players might be willing to test the rule on that.\n\nAs far as I’m concerned, though, golf has a bigger issue to solve – slow play. That would be at the top of my list.\n\nCalendar material\n\nI’ve found golf just fine in this late-fall, early-winter period in Chicago and only wish more courses were still open. The Nos. 1 and 3 layouts at Cog Hill, in Lemont, are among the few that will remain open year-around, and some fun events are coming up on those.\n\nThe Frosty’s 3-Club Open will be held over No. 1 on Dec. 9 and the Eskimo Open will be played on both courses on Jan. 6.\n\nAlso notable is the Jan. 1 deadline established by the Western Golf Assn. for the sale of its holiday ticket package. The package includes two any-day tournament tickets, lanyards and ticket holders to next September’s BMW Championship at Conway Farms for a great price — $65. Only 2,500 such packages will be available.\n\nThere wasn’t much movement in Chicago’s club professional ranks the past few years, but that’s not the case now. Already five well-established head pros have announced plans to move on.\n\nThe move creating the most ripple effect was Mike Scully’s departure from Medinah immediate after the Ryder Cup. He is now in charge at Desert Mountain, a Scottsdale, Ariz., resort that has five courses.\n\nScully was also the vice president of the Illinois PGA, so his leaving the area after nearly 10 years created some adjustment in the section’s rotation of officers. Chris Gumbach became the IPGA’s 25th president at the Fall Annual Meeting. Gumbach, a member of the board of directors from 2007-12, succeeds Casey Brozek, who will continue on the board as honorary president.\n\nGumbach, in his 18th year at River Forest Country Club, has been that club’s head professional the past seven seasons.\n\nScully’s position as vice president was taken over by Jim Opp, the head professional at Bonnie Dundee who has been on the IPGA board for eight years and was most recently chairman of the Education Committee. Mark Labiak, in his 15th season at Ruth Lake, is the new secretary and Hans Larson (Westmoreland), Jim Miller (Bloomington) and Mike Picciano (Bull Valley) have taken on three-year terms on the board of directors.\n\nOther pros departing their jobs are Ron Romack, at Exmoor; Carmen Molinaro, at Buffalo Grove and Arboretum, Jim Arendt at Naperville and Michael Knights at Midlothian. Molinaro and Arendt announced their retirements.\n\nWatson honored at WGA’s Green Coat Gala\n\nTom Watson (left) is welcomed into the Western Golf Association’s Caddie Hall of Fame by WGA executive director John Kaczkowski at the WGA’s Green Coat Gala at Chicago’s Peninsula Hotel. (Chuck Cherney Photo).\n\nNorthwestern lands big-time recruits\n\nNorthwestern coaches Pat Goss and Emily Fletcher have each signed high profile recruits to letters of intent for 2013.\n\nGoss picked up Matt Fitzpatrick of Sheffield, England, the 2012 British Boys Amateur champion. Goss calls him “the most significant player we’ve signed since Luke Donald’ and predicts Fitzgerald “will make an immediate impact on our program.’’\n\nFletcher added Kacie Komoto to her women’s team. Komoto, from Punahoe High School in Honolulu, Hawaii, is the reigning Antigua National High School champion. She was the Hawaii state champion in 2011.\n\nCDGA revamps schedule, adds Super Seniors\n\nThe Chicago District Golf Assn. will had the first CDGA Super Seniors tourney to its schedule for 2013. The flighted one-day event for players 65 and over will be held Aug. 5 at Royal Hawk, in St. Charles.\n\nMeanwhile, the CDGA’s premier event – the 83rd Illinois State Amateur – will get a major date change. It’ll be held July 16-18 at Aldeen, in Rockford, instead of taking its long-held spot on the calendar in the second week of August. The change will make the State Am a lead-in to the Illinois Open and Western Amateur and avoid a conflict with the U.S. Amateur, which received a date alteration from the U.S. Golf Assn.\n\nAnother significant change on the CDGA slate involves the 21st Illinois Mid-Amateur at Flossmoor. Usually held in May, the tourney will be conducted Aug. 27-28 in 2013.\n\nHere and there\n\nJim Richerson, who heads Kohler Company’s golf operations, is the new Region 6 director for the PGA of America. He succeeds Butler National’s Bruce Patterson as the focal point for PGA activities in Illinois, Indiana and Wisconsin.\n\nThe Bolingbrook Sports Dome (formerly the Ditka Dome) now has its indoor golf operation in full swing. The facility was renovated by new owner Jim McWethy, owner of the Mistwood course in Romeoville, during the summer.\n\nTwo of Wisconsin’s top courses — Meadow Valleys course at Blackwolf Run and the Irish course at Whistling Straits – will offer reduced rates until their closing on Nov. 25.\n\nLedgeStone, one of Missouri’s best public facilities in Branson, will hold a toy drive through Dec. 22. Players will get a free round (with a $22 cart fee) if they donate a toy during play Monday-Thursday.\n\nDid you know?\n\nThe George S. May Insurance building, somewhat of a Chicago golf landmark, is now more. Located at Touhy and Washington in Park Ridge, it was recently taken down to make room for a Whole Foods store. May was a pioneer tournament promoter who put on big-money, high-profile tournaments at Tam O’Shanter in the 1940s and 1950s. Tam, long since reduced to nine holes, is located in Niles and is about two miles from where the May headquarters was located."
