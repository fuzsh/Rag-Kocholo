He is advised by Dr. Adwait Nadkarni. His main research interests are in understanding the security and privacy threats in modern operating systems, and building tools that help in their mitigation. His research has been published in various conferences such as ACM and IEEE. His paper on the study of security vulnerabilities in smart home platforms won the ‘best paper award’ at ACM CODASPY’19, and also received wide media coverage. Currently, he is the lead graduate student of the Secure Platforms Lab, supervised by Dr. Nadkarni. Through the lab, he actively engages in the mentorship of undergraduate students, as well as in community outreach programs. He was part of the Emerging Scholar Series at William & Mary, where he presented his research on the security of smart homes to the Williamsburg community. Due to the tangled nature of science and policy, Kaushal believes that the active participation of both sides is vital to increase the impact of science and to create effective policies. He is looking forward to working as a COVES Fellow over the summer.\n\nJasmine Lewis\n\nVirginia Tech\n\nJasmine is a Ph.D. student studying biological psychology at Virginia Tech. Before coming to Virginia Tech, she received her B.S. in Psychology from the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill and her M.S. in Biomedical Sciences from Liberty University. Her research interests include the effects of childhood trauma and stress on health outcomes. More specifically, she is interested in the immunological and genetic effects of traumatic stress in youth who have been exposed to violence either directly or indirectly. She hopes to use her research to further the understanding of the impact of traumatic events on youth development overall and inform prevention/intervention efforts.\n\nSarah Morton\n\nVirginia Commonwealth University\n\nSarah is a rising fourth-year doctoral student studying health psychology at Virginia Commonwealth University (VCU). She grew up in a small rural community about 40 miles outside of Richmond, VA and earned her B.S. degree in psychology from VCU. She enjoyed working with several different community intervention research programs before moving to Michigan in 2014 to pursue an M.S. in clinical psychology at Eastern Michigan University. After graduation, she worked in private practice as a licensed psychotherapist and autism evaluation consultant for several years before moving back to Virginia and joining her current program. Sarah’s current research focuses broadly on exploring the associations between patient-provider interactions, medical distrust, and health disparities in pediatric and young adult illness populations. She is passionate about the translation of health research into sustainable community-focused programs and health policies, and looks forward to further developing her science policy skills as a 2023 COVES policy fellow.\n\nGeovani Muñoz\n\nVirginia Commonwealth University\n\nGeovani Muñoz is a Ph.D. student in Counseling Psychology going into his third year of study at Virginia Commonwealth University. Prior to attending VCU, Geovani was a McNair Scholar and received his Bachelor’s degree in Psychology with a minor in Political Science from California State Polytechnic University, Pomona. His research interests are in the area of addressing mental health disparities among racial-ethnic minoritized communities, improving mental health utilization, investigating systemic factors (e.g., public policy) impacting mental health access, and substance use.\n\nNishat Ara Nipa\n\nOld Dominion University\n\nNishat is a first-year Ph.D. student at Old Dominion University's Department of Modeling & Simulation.
