        "text": "James R. Strauch, 73, of Bucyrus, went home to the Lord Sunday, May 12, 2013 following his death at Altercare of Bucyrus after a lengthy illness.\n\nJim was born January 31, 1940 in Bucyrus to the late Kenneth C. and Marjorie L. (Faust) Strauch. He graduated from Bucyrus in 1958 and then attended college at Bowling Green State University for a short time before returning to Bucyrus where he took a job at Timken and enjoyed working there until retiring in 1995. He met Janet Hartschuh in the spring of 1963. They were married June 21, 1964 at Baseline UCC and she survives.\n\nJim was known as somewhat of a perfectionist and believed in doing things right the first time. This very much pertained to caring for his lawn and the family cars. He served as a mentor to his children while coaching them in both minor and little league baseball and served as their life coach in anything they did. He believed in making others happy and was a motivator to many.\n\nJim was a member of St. John's UCC where he served on the church consistory and was a Deacon.\n\nHe had a big heart for animals, especially his 4 boxer dogs, and Jim loved driving and taking vacations. The family was always packing up the green car or van for a road trip vacation to various points of interest across the United States. Jim enjoyed driving so much that following retirement, he picked up and delivered cars for Walston Motors for a number of years. He relaxed by watching the Indians, Browns, Packers and OSU Buckeyes in action as well as keeping up with the news.\n\nIn addition to his wife of 48 years, Jim is survived by two sons, Gary (Jill) Strauch and their daughter, Andrea of Bidwell, Ohio and David Strauch of Bucyrus; one sister, JoAnn Powell of Bucyrus as well as a very special family friend, Angie Lepp and her daughter, Shiloh. Preceding him in death is a brother-in-law, Sam Powell.\n\nHis family will receive friends from 2-4 and 7-9 p.m. Wednesday, May 15 at Wise Funeral Service. His funeral will be held at 10:30 a.m. Thursday at St. John's UCC with Rev. Steven E. Voelker officiating. Burial will follow in Oakwood Cemetery.\n\nMemorial contributions may be given to the National Parkinson Foundation; St. John's UCC or the Humane Society serving Crawford County through the funeral home.\n\nVisitation:\n\nWednesday, May 15, 2013 2-4 & 7-9 p.m.\n\nWise Funeral Service, 129 W. Warren St., Bucyrus, Ohio 44820\n\nService:\n\nThursday, May 16, 2013 10:30 a.m.\n\nSt. John's UCC, 120 S. Lane Street, Bucyrus, Ohio 44820\n\nCemetery:\n\nOakwood Cemetery, 835 Kaler Ave., Bucyrus, Ohio 44820"
