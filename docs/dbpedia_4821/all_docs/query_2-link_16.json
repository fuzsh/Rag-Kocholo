        "text": "Many Canadian teenagers enjoy snowboarding and waveboarding, and James Lepp happens to be one of them. But the 19-year-old from Abbotsford, B.C., is the only one who's also proven himself capable of winning a professional golf tournament. Lepp won the Canadian Tour's Greater Vancouver Classic on Sunday.\n\nLepp shot 19-under-par 269 to win by five shots, becoming the first Canadian amateur to win a pro event since Rob McMillan took the 1996 Manitoba Open. McMillan has gone on to have modest success as a professional on the Canadian Tour. Lepp is still in college. He'll transfer this fall from the University of Illinois, where he's been studying meteorology, to the University of Washington.\n\n\"I always wanted to go to Washington,\" Lepp said from his home in Abbotsford the other night. \"But when I was first being recruited, they didn't have any money for a scholarship [for him]and Illinois was my best choice.\"\n\nLepp spoke highly of the University of Illinois, where he spent two years. But he was too far from home for his liking.\n\n\"My decision to go to Washington has nothing to do with how Illinois treated me, or anything that I didn't like there,\" Lepp said. \"The coach and the players were good, but I didn't feel at home there and wasn't happy. Golf doesn't always go so well, and I'd have liked to get home sometimes. Now I'll be within a two-hour drive of home.\"\n\nMeanwhile, Lepp's win last weekend is the most impressive accomplishment by a Canadian golfer this year, except for Mike Weir's win in the Masters. It wasn't necessarily a surprise, though. Lepp has been doing great things in amateur golf.\n\nHe won the 2001 Canadian Junior Championship by nine shots, and won it again last year by a shot. He's won the 2002 and 2003 B.C. Amateurs, and the 2002 B.C. Junior. He was Big Ten player of the year in his college conference for the 2002-2003 season, and a second team All-American as well.\n\nIn June, Lepp also won the inaugural Copa de las Americas with his teammate Peter Laws of Mississauga, Ont. Laws, a promising Kent State University sophomore, won the individual title in this 19-nation event in Puerto Rico. They defeated the overwhelming U.S. favourites, last year's U.S. Amateur champion Ricky Barnes and last year's U.S. Public Links champion Ryan Moore, both of whom played in this year's Masters.\n\nLepp, a member of the Ledgeview club in Abbotsford, was followed by plenty of friends and family on Sunday at the Swan-e-Set Bay Resort and Country Club in nearby Pitt Meadows. His dad Dan caddied for him. Lepp took a two-shot lead into the last round, birdied the first hole, shot 67, and simply waxed the tour pros.\n\n\"I didn't take any of their money,\" said Lepp, who couldn't accept prize money. \"But maybe I hurt their egos a bit,\" he laughed. It was a kind laugh. Though young, Lepp knows that he has work to do if he means to succeed as a tour pro down the road.\n\nHe means down the road, too. Lepp intends to finish school, and he might even get himself a swing coach in time. He's been doing well on his own, though, and isn't in a rush.\n\n\"I've never really worked with anybody,\" Lepp said. \"I'm self-taught. It's hard to find a coach when you're almost a better coach for yourself. When I'm playing bad I'm better off finding something on my own for a quick fix. But I know that for the long term I'll need somebody to work with me.\"\n\nHe feels this way because, like Weir when he turned pro, he knows his swing has flaws.\n\n\"I've done it all by feel so far,\" Lepp said. \"Maybe I'm playing well enough now to play the Nationwide Tour [a step below the PGA Tour] but I swing fast and I hit the ball really low, especially with my long irons. You can't do that on the PGA Tour, where you need to hit the long irons up in the air.\"\n\nLepp will have many opportunities to test himself further in the coming weeks: this week's Pacific Coast Amateur at Capilano in West Vancouver; next week's Canadian Amateur at Shaughnessy in Vancouver. And he's sure to get an exemption into the Bell Canadian Open next month at the Hamilton Golf and Country Club in Ancaster, Ont.\n\nLepp played the Canadian Open last year, and missed the cut. He said he was nervous in practice with the pros, saying things to himself such as, \"Don't chunk this shot.\" But he didn't feel nervous during the tournament. Still, he did miss the cut.\n\nNext month? Who knows? He's just won a pro event, and maybe he'll have won the Canadian Amateur by then. Golf being golf, however, there's no sense predicting what might happen. One thing is sure: Lepp is a hugely talented player, and well worth following.\n\nrube@sympatico.ca\n\nJames Lepp\n\nBorn: Nov. 19, 1983\n\nHometown: Abbotsford, B.C.\n\nFamily: Parents, Dan and Jacqui; sisters, Angela, Jessica and Courtney.\n\nSchool: Transferring from the University of Illinois to the University of Washington this fall.\n\nHighlights: Chosen Big 10 player of the year in 2002-03 after recording nine top-five finishes in 11 National Collegiate Athletic Association tournaments and broke Steve Bricker's school record for stroke average (71.41); won 2001 Canadian Junior Amateur by nine strokes and defended his title in 2002; selected Big 10 freshman of the year and honourable mention all-American in 2001-02.\n\nSource: fightingillini.ocsn.com."
