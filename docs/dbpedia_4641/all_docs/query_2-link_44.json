        "text": "What type of shoes should I wear for comfort?\n\nWith so many stylish shoe styles available, it can be easy to forget the sole purpose of wearing shoes: practicality. A good pair of shoes is designed to help support and protect your feet, letting you go about your days in comfort.\n\nIf your feet are sensitive, you may want to pay particular attention to what type of shoes you’re wearing. Can’t decide what style to choose? Our comfortable shoe guide will help you determine which shoes are best for sensitive feet.\n\nWhy do my feet hurt?\n\nYour feet might hurt if you:\n\nWear shoes that don’t fit properly\n\nHave blisters and sores\n\nHave an ingrown toenail\n\nAre standing up or walking for extended periods\n\nHave an injury\n\nHave a strain from exercising\n\nHow to treat sore feet\n\nSome of these problems are easier to solve than others. If your shoes don’t fit properly, it may be as simple as getting your feet measured and buying a pair that works based on your measurements.\n\nBlisters and sores can be treated with plenty of rest and specialized band-aids. If you spend lots of time on your feet and rest isn’t an option (if you’re working or caring for a loved one), make sure your shoes are comfortable and fit correctly.\n\nIt’s a good idea to rotate between two pairs of shoes. If you spend time in wet conditions, alternate between shoes so wet ones can dry while you’re wearing the others.\n\nSee medical advice for any cuts, infections or injuries that aren’t going away by themselves. Your healthcare professional may advise you to rest your feet or buy shoes to keep them as comfortable as possible.\n\nComfortable shoes for sensitive feet\n\nIf your feet are sensitive, getting comfortable shoes may help solve aches and pains. We stock many shoe styles made with the best quality materials, designed for comfort and practicality.\n\nWe’ve studied the human foot for decades. We know the recipe to create the most comfortable, high-quality shoes that look great. That’s why all our ranges are available in whole sizes, half sizes and widths to suit everyone. Plenty come with innovative underfoot cushioning, resulting in a perfect fit.\n\nMen’s shoes for sensitive feet\n\nSearching for men’s comfortable shoes? Here are some of our favorites:\n\nMen’s comfortable sneakers\n\nAs some of the best shoes for foot problems, everyone should own at least one pair of sneakers.
