        "text": "7 years ago, Brian Clark glimpsed the future.\n\nWith $1,000, no audience, and no connections, he started a simple blog and slowly, steadily built a vast resource for empowering online writers.\n\nNow, he’s the CEO of a multi-million dollar software company built around the credo of helping writers and online publishers grow their brands and businesses — the right way.\n\nBy writing and delivering valuable content, Brian has earned a vast audience, and some impressive accolades over the years.\n\nThat’s why it’s only fitting that the inaugural issue of The Writer Files takes a snapshot of a prolific blogger, entrepreneur, teacher, and Galaga aficionado.\n\nLet’s flip through the file of Brian Clark, writer …\n\nAbout the writer …\n\nWho are you and what do you do?\n\nI’m Brian Clark, and I use online content to circumvent traditional media for fun and profit.\n\nWhat is your area of expertise as a writer or online publisher?\n\nEducation. Persuasion. Bad Twitter jokes.\n\nWhere can we find your writing?\n\nCopyblogger, Further, Your Boulder, and other undisclosed locations.\n\nThe writer’s productivity …\n\nHow much time per day do you spend reading or doing research?\n\n2-3 hours, minimum.\n\nBefore you begin to write, do you have any pre-game rituals or practices?\n\nFigurative self-immolation. Literally.\n\nWhat’s your best advice for overcoming procrastination?\n\nLet me get back to you on this one.\n\nWhat time of day is most productive for your writing or content production?\n\nMornings in general, and specifically just before it truly needs to get done.\n\nDo you generally adhere to a rigid or flexible writing system?\n\nIf flexible means somewhat schizophrenic and unreliable, and yet still gets done … yeah, that.\n\nHow many hours a day do you spend actually writing (excluding email, social media etc.)?\n\nDepends on the day. Between one hour and six.\n\nDo you write every day?\n\nSadly, not as much lately. But I’m getting back to it.\n\nReading like a crazy person taught me how to use words. Writing every day taught me how to use words in my own voice.\n\nOnce you get that voice, you can write whenever you deem necessary. I’m a very pragmatic writer, so I write when it needs to be done — others need it every day like oxygen.\n\nThe writer’s creativity …\n\nDefine creativity.\n\nSeeing the intersection of seemingly unrelated topics and combining them into something new.\n\nWho are your favorite authors, online or off?\n\nWilliam Gibson. Fyodor Dostoyevsky. J.D. Salinger. Chuck Palahniuk.\n\nCan you share a best-loved quote?\n\n“The future is already here – it’s just not evenly distributed.” ~ William Gibson\n\nDo you prefer a particular type of music (or silence) when you write?\n\nAmbient with no or minimal lyrics. Words get in the way of the words.\n\nHow would you personally like to grow creatively as a writer?\n\nIn height. No, really … I want to write less pragmatically, just for the sake of it.\n\nDo you believe in “writer’s block”? If so, how do you avoid it?\n\nI don’t get blocked about what to say — I either have something to say or I don’t. I get blocked as to how best to say it, which is the crux of the matter. So, I work at it in my head until I’m close enough to sit down.\n\nWho or what is your “Muse” at the moment (i.e. specific creative inspirations)?\n\nI can read just about anything and come up with inspiration. The connections are everywhere you care to look.\n\nWould you consider yourself someone who likes to “take risks?”\n\nOn one hand, my entire life is a risk. On the other, I couldn’t accomplish anything any other way. Trying to work a job I hated would be much riskier … for everyone.\n\nWhat makes a writer great?\n\nCaring so much you can’t let it go before getting people to understand.\n\nThe writer’s workflow …\n\nWhat hardware or typewriter model are you presently using?\n\nA couple of Macs.\n\nWhat software are you using for writing and general workflow?\n\nWord for Mac, Evernote, Google Docs, scraps of paper, a rapidly diminishing memory.\n\nDo you have any tricks for staying focused?\n\nFirst and foremost, I … squirrel!\n\nHave you run into any serious challenges or obstacles to getting words onto the page?\n\nI’ve found that my writing output is especially low during REM sleep. Also, whenever the in-laws are over.\n\nHow do you stay organized (methods, systems, or “mad science”)?\n\nI can keep a whole lot in my head until it’s ready to come out. This is both a blessing and a curse, but it’s always worked for me.\n\nHow do you relax at the end of a hard day?\n\nThankfully, television is excellent now. I used to never watch TV, but now a great televised comedy or drama at the end of the day makes me exceptionally happy.\n\nA few questions just for the fun of it …\n\nWho (or what) has been your greatest teacher?\n\nMy greatest teacher has been simply trying things … not to succeed, but to learn. In that context, there is no failure.\n\nWhat’s your biggest aggravation or pet peeve at the moment (writing related or otherwise)?\n\nGotta say, I’m pretty happy at the moment. It’s my new thing.\n\nChoose one author, living or dead, that you would like to have dinner with.\n\nI’d have to go with [William] Gibson. He’d look down on me for being marketing scum, at least through the appetizers. But then I’d dazzle him with my conversation skills, while revealing an elaborate theory that proves he’s secretly quite fond of Hubertus Bigend.\n\nDo you have a motto, credo or general slogan that you live by?\n\nWhat’s the worst that could happen?\n\nWhat do you see as your greatest success in life?\n\nMy kids are wonderful people so far. That could change.\n\nIf you could take a vacation anywhere in the world tomorrow, where would you go (cost or responsibilities are no object)?\n\nI got into this writing and Internet thing primarily because I want to be able to go anywhere and it wouldn’t matter about work. And I do. It’s rarely a true vacation, but I truly enjoy my work.\n\nWhat would you like to do more of in the coming year?\n\nI’d like my editorial team to make me irrelevant instead of making me answer 30 questions on a Tuesday night.\n\nCan you offer any advice to writers and content producers that you might offer yourself, if you could go back in time and “do it all over?”\n\nJust one word. Plastics.\n\nPlease tell our readers where they can connect with you online.\n\nUmm, seriously? We’re already here.\n\nIs there anything else you’d like our readers to know?\n\nThings are about to get seriously great for online writers and content creators. I guarantee it.\n\nAnd finally, the writer’s desk …\n\nNothing says more about a writer than the space they use to create.\n\nNo writer’s desk is the same.\n\nThis is where the magic happens, and where Brian literally sets himself on fire, figuratively. And plays Galaga.\n\nThanks for tuning in to The Writer Files …\n\nStay tuned for another revealing Q&A from one of my favorite working writers … “coming soon.”\n\nIf you’re already subscribed to Copyblogger via email or RSS, the next installment will be delivered to you just like the rest of our daily content.\n\nIf not, go ahead and subscribe right now so you don’t miss a thing.\n\nNow get back to work!"
