        "text": "When the new album from rapper Lil Yachty, \"Let's Start Here,\" dropped on Jan. 27, it caught the pop world by surprise.\n\nInstead of a collection of hip-hop tracks, it's an experimental, psychedelicized indie-rock album -- made with the help of members of two alt-rock bands, MGMT and Unknown Mortal Orchestra, as well as the synth-pop duo Magdalena Bay -- that's closer to Tame Impala than T-Pain.\n\nIt's actually just the tip of a musical iceberg of a new generation of Black performers embracing a variety of contemporary rock sounds and refashioning them in their own image. But it shouldn't be too surprising since rock music has its roots in Black music.\n\nAAPI ROCK: Go beyond K-pop with 20+ Asian American, Pacific Islander and Asian indie-rock acts.\n\nThe newcomers include the likes of Jean Dawson, whose whimsical song \"Pirate Radio\" reaches an almost Brian Wilson/\"Sgt. Pepper's\" level of pop bliss, and Benjamin Carter whose guitar-driven \"Black Boys on the Radio\" is a virtual anthem for the scene. But they aren't simply replicating what's come before but bringing their own voices and point-of-view.\n\nProper's latest single, the anti-police-violence \"Red, White, & Blue\" -- with its chorus of \"so you can beat me till I'm red, white and blue\" -- is suddenly more relevant than ever. As Josh Shaw, the front man of Blvck Hippie says, his band is just \"tryna show Black kids they can be weird, too.\"\n\nSo, here are 26 Black or Black-led indie-rock and Afro-punk acts whose work is worth exploring. Also, you can hear them and more on the \"Young, Gifted, Black and Indie: Black Indie Rock & Afro-Punk\" playlist on Spotify as well as on Apple Music featuring Black rock from the last two decades, including the likes of Prince, Willow, TV on the Radio and Lenny Kravitz.\n\nProper.\n\nThis New York trio makes smart, pointed and funny guitar-rock that provokes both laughter and thought with \"Red, White, & Blue\" and \"You Good? (In Media Res)\" being cases in point. On its latest album, \"The Great American Novel,\" a meditation on the relationship between Black America and America, the band moves away from its more stripped-down early approach and veers toward a more full-bodied, prog and metal-influenced sound.\n\nIf you like: Living Colour, Green Day\n\nBartees Strange\n\nWashington, D.C.-based Strange, born Bartees Leon Cox Jr., makes a brand of smart, emotional guitar rock that is instantly appealing on such tracks as \"Heavy Heart\" and \"Escape This Circus.\" So it's not a shock that he released \"Say Goodbye to Pretty Boy,\" a 2020 EP of covers of songs by The National, a band with which he shares a literate sensibility. But there's also a distinctive R&B edge in some tracks, such as \"Hennessy,\" and a point of view that is distinctly African American. His first album, \"Live Forever,\" was named the indie-music site Pitchfork's best new music of 2020.\n\nIf you like: TV on the Radio, The National\n\nArlo Parks\n\nWhen this British singer-songwriter made her Houston debut at White Oak Music Hall in the fall of 2021, she surprised with a sense of rock ’n’ roll that upended the soft-focus, poet-folkie charm of her early singles. But her sharp lyricism and intensely personal sketches of life as a young bisexual in Britain still came through, as on the alt-radio hit \"Eugene,\" one of the best songs ever about youthful jealousy.\n\nIf you like: Frank Ocean, Tracy Chapman, Billie Eilish\n\nISLEY BROTHERS: Why aren't they worshipped as the rock gods they are?.\n\nBenjamin Booker\n\nHis 2014 song \"Violent Shiver\" is an explosive spasm of garage-rock riff-o-rama and is the singer-guitarist's best-known track. But the New Orleans musician can swing from that to the rootsy, bluesy swagger of \"Believe\" and \"Spoonful,\" making for a welcome range. After seemingly disappearing from the scene, Booker popped up again in 2022 with some live shows.\n\nIf you like: The Black Keys, Alabama Shakes, Gary Clark Jr.\n\nJackie Venson\n\nH.E.R. and many others notwithstanding, when most people think of a stereotypical rock or blues guitarist, they think of a guy. Austin's Jackie Venson is out to change all that. Over the course of four studio albums and several live releases (the stage is where she shines brightest), she has earned a loyal following with her smokin’ blues-rock. She plays McGonigel's Mucky Duck April 1.\n\nIf you like: Gary Clark Jr., Samantha Fish, Keb' Mo'\n\nTAME IMPALA AND HIP-HOP: How Aussie indie-rocker Tame Impala became a hip-hop insider\n\nBlvck Hippie\n\nThis trio's melancholic pop has been described as \"sad boy indie rock\" (signature tracks: \"If You Feel Alone at Parties\" and \"Art School\") and, appropriately, Josh Shaw formed the group in his college dorm room.\n\nIf you like: The Feelies, Kid Cudi, The Smiths\n\nMicah Edwards\n\nThe music of Houston native Micah Edwards, brother of country singer Madeline Edwards, dances nimbly on the lines between jazz, neo-soul and lo-fi pop. He plays the Heights Theater Feb. 25.\n\nIf you like: Rex Orange County, Boy Pablo, Dominic Fike\n\nTECHNO HAS BLACK ROOTS: Drake is just the latest to flower.\n\nHannah Jadagu\n\nThough Hannah Jadagu hails from Mesquite in North Texas, she is signed to Seattle's Sub Pop Records, where her sublime pop fits right in with the likes of The Postal Service and Washed Out.\n\nIf you like: Japanese Breakfast, Saint Etienne, Spill Tab, Bon Iver, Mitski, Arlo Parks\n\nCautious Clay\n\nClay (Joshua Karpeh) from Cleveland broke through on alternative radio in 2018 with \"Cold War,\" a track sampled by Taylor Swift on her \"Lover\" album. His soulful folk goes down easily on such albums as \"Deadpan Love\" and \"Table of Context.\"\n\nIf you like: Leon Bridges, Omar Apollo\n\nMorMor\n\nToronto singer Seth Nyquist, who goes by the name of MorMor, crafts low-key, soulful pop topped by his crystalline falsetto vocals. MorMor’s music often creates the sensation of floating.\n\nIf you like: Men I Trust, Twin Shadow\n\nJean Dawson\n\nWhile many on the indie scene make stripped-down pop, Jean Dawson indulges in heavily orchestrated Technicolor pop-rock-soul that defies easy categorization on his latest album, \"Chaos Now.\" From the punkish \"Sick of It\" to the handclapping \"Bad Fruit\" and the aforementioned \"Pirate Radio,\" Dawson makes music that is wildly ambitious.\n\nIf you like: Prince, Earl Sweatshirt, Tame Impala, Panic! At the Disco\n\nMind Shrine\n\nThis Houston quartet -- fronted by Jess Howard whose silky, jazzy vocals bear a resemblance to Asli Omar from one of H-Town's best bands, the Tontons -- makes hooky, retro indie-pop that feels like a day at the beach.\n\nIf you like: The Tontons, Saint Etienne\n\nLabrinth\n\nBy now, you've probably heard Labrinth's music in the TV commercial for the Cadillac Lyric or in the soundtrack for HBO's hit series \"Euphoria.\" But there's a lot more where that came from in the British performer's catalog.\n\nIf you like: The Weeknd, Bruno Mars\n\nAlgiers\n\nDespite being named after the capital of Algeria, these guys hail from Atlanta. And their music, in songs such as \"The Underside of Power\" and \"Blood,\" isn't North African but a wiry brand of soul-influenced, politically inspired post-punk fronted by the intense Franklin James Fisher. New album, \"Shook,\" drops Feb. 24.\n\nIf you like: Gang of Four, Rage Against the Machine, Arctic Monkeys\n\nVagabon\n\nLaetitia Tamiko is a Cameroonian American from New York whose electro-tinged, highly personal indie-folk is immediately arresting. Her duet with Courtney Barnett on a cover of Rod Stewart's \"Reason to Believe\" makes the song their own.\n\nIf you like: Snail Mail, Soccer Mommy\n\nAbraham Alexander\n\nBorn in Greece to Nigerian parents, Alexander was raised in Fort Worth, and he leans heavily on his Texas roots in his folky, bluesy pop. Austin's Gary Clark Jr. even appears on a version of his song \"Stay.\"\n\nIf you like: Leon Bridges, Charley Crockett\n\nYuno\n\nPop doesn't get much more joyously shimmering than Yuno's alt-rock hit \"Sunlight.\" But that's just a hint of the summery charm of the music by this Floridian. He even recorded a faithful version of Beach House's \"Zebra.\"\n\nIf you like: Dayglow, P.M. Dawn, Tame Impala, Beach House\n\nYoung Fathers\n\nThis Scottish trio's dark-hued, hip-hop-inflected indie-rock won Britain's Mercury Prize, beating out the likes of Damon Albarn, FKA Twigs and Bombay Bicycle Club. New album, \"Heavy Heavy,\" comes out Feb. 3.\n\nIf you like: The Weeknd, Frank Ocean, Massive Attack\n\nSoul Glo\n\nHardcore punk infused with a young African American sensibility is this Philly trio's stock-in-trade. The group's reputation has been growing with the release of its \"Diaspora Problems\" album last year, which Pitchfork declared was \"the future of hardcore we need more than we’ve earned.\"\n\nIf you like: Bad Brains, Fishbone, Rage Against the Machine\n\nM.A.G.S.\n\nElliott Douglas, who performs under the name of M.A.G.S., makes impassioned, indie guitar rock that can range from the dreamy \"Beachlove\" to the raucous \"Demon.\"\n\nIf you like: Parquet Courts, Car Seat Headrest\n\nJacob Banks\n\nThis British singer has one of the strongest voices in the field, giving such songs as \"Chainsmoking\" and \"Monster\" a soulful roar.\n\nIf you like: Adele, Leon Bridges\n\nBenjamin Carter\n\nThe infectious \"Black Boys on the Radio\" acts as a rocking introduction to Carter's new style. On his 2022 \"Black Boys on the Radio: Part 1\" EP, Carter is moving away from the lo-fi, jazzier hip-hop feel of his early material and into a more accessible brand of rock.\n\nIf you like: John Mayer, Lenny Kravitz\n\nMonoNeon\n\nBassist MonoNeon (Dwayne Thomas Jr.) is admired by musicians, having played with Prince, George Clinton and a variety of avant-garde jazz projects. On his own, he makes funky indie R&B with a ’70s edge.\n\nIf you like: Thundercat, Bootsy Collins, Esperanza Spalding\n\nSudan Archives\n\nSudan Archives is Brittney Denise Parks plays violin, but instead of putting it into a classical or country context, she makes an eclectic style of experimental and electronic R&B/pop.\n\nIf you like: M.I.A., Solange\n\nFlowerovlove\n\nJoyce Cisse is better known as Flowerovlove, and that sums up the Londoner's sweet, dreamy, giddy indie-pop.\n\nIf you like: Spill Tab, Beabadoobee, Pink Pantheress\n\nMore acts to explore\n\nThere are many other new acts worth checking out, including Black Surfer, Dominic Fike, Yves Tumor, Petite Noir, Jany Green, Blood Orange, A'mosi Just a Label, Bakar, Tai Verdes, Jacob Banks, Bongeziwe Mabandla, Debby Friday, Ghostpoet, Francine Thirteen, KMRU, Isaac Dunbar, Binki, Dijon, Clayrocksu, PawPaw Rod, Paris Texas, Orion Sun, KAMAUU, Morgan Reese, Serpentwithfeet and Odie."
