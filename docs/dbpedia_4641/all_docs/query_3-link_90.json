        "text": "Great leadership is everywhere, and the creative arts can be a great place to find lessons and inspiration for your own leadership journey.\n\nI had the pleasure of catching one of my favorite live musicians, Gary Clark Jr, last night in Milwaukee at the Riverside Theater. Going to a concert where you just know the band is going to play late on a weeknight can be a real double-edged sword. You'll be out way past your usual bedtime on a 'school night' but you're also going to get a chance to clear your head after a long work day and hopefully get to bed around midnight with some lasting memories of a great performance.\n\nWhen it's a Wednesday night show with Gary Clark Jr, who's known to some as 'The Chosen One', you're all but guaranteed a really late night and a mind-blowing musical experience.\n\nBut, this isn't a concert review on LinkedIn. I was motivated to write this post after watching the way Gary artfully displays the traits of a strong and confident leader that we should all strive for in our chosen career pursuits. Despite being a relatively young artist at 33 years old, and having an amazing set of guitar chops coupled with a chameleon's gift for flowing smoothly into a wide range of vocal styles, Clark displays leadership traits that elevate his live shows well beyond his already excellent recorded work.\n\nOne of the things you'll always see when you catch him live is a healthy dose of his rhythm guitarist, Mike \"King\" Zapata. Clark will often let Zapata take the lion's share of the lead guitar work early in the show, setting the stage for what's to follow and allowing Clark to focus on vocals and being out front getting the crowd involved. It takes a lot of confidence to let your side man shine when you know the entire crowd came to see you. The name on the ticket is 'Gary Clark Jr.' not 'the Gary Clark Jr Band'.\n\nAnd, Zapata lives up to Clark's trust... every time. A gifted musician in his own right, you have to believe that some of the reasons Zapata tours as a backing musician for a luminary rock star are Clark's belief in him and the opportunity to showcase his own skills to a much wider audience. Gary Clark Jr. gives Zapata a platform to ply his trade in front of audiences numbering in the thousands and creates an environment of trust and appreciation that allows Zapata to thrive and impress audiences.\n\nLast night, Clark didn't stop there. He's currently touring with independent artist Jackie Venson, another immensely talented guitarist and vocalist. Clark closed the show with his signature encore number, Bright Lights, Big City, whose chorus repeats the line \"you're gonna know my name by the end of the night\"... as bold and self-centered a 'rock star' statement as you'll find in 2017. But Clark did an amazing thing for the close of his show, inviting his opening act on stage, giving her an opportunity to play one of his signature songs and, when she didn't have a guitar pick, he handed her his and walked off stage right, conceding the spotlight to Venson for an extended solo.\n\nSo, when you're leading people, take these lessons from Gary Clark Jr. - Don't be afraid to let your team have their moment in the spotlight, because more often than not they'll live up to the opportunity. And, ask yourself on a regular basis if you're doing everything you can to create an environment of trust, where your team can take chances, stretch their expectations for themselves, and showcase the talents that make your team what it is. It's your responsibility as a leader to give your team that platform. And, if you're doing it like Gary, if you're doing it right, you'll find that elevating your team elevates you as well. That's what happens when you have more opportunities to focus on your own responsibilities.\n\nAnd, if you ever get the chance to see Gary Clark Jr and his talented band live and in person, take the opportunity. It's a rare guitar-driven 'front man' who has the ability to lead his band, his team, to scale the heights they achieve in concert."
