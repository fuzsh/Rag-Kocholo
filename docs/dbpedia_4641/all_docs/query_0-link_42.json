        "text": "Metallica. Quite possibly the biggest band on earth. So big, there isn’t one act that would be headliner over them. Except, God. And that fact was proven recently. According to guitar.com, the band was playing in Munich Germany when the heavens opened, rain poured, and the sky lit up.\n\nBasically, the band and everyone in the stadium rode the lightning. (too bad they weren’t playing “Ride the Lightning” when the Electricity hit the skies. I guess, when it comes to Metallica songs, God is more a Master of Puppets fan.\n\nMetallica Songs Raised Me\n\nIt’s no secret that I’m a rocking kind of girl. Yes, I love to boogie, and almost became a professional dancer (no, not that kind. I’m usually on the other side of the pole) . Anyways, one of my favorite bands since I was a young punk teenager is Metallica. I was introduced to them by one of my stoner friends as we were chillin in a park where I grew up.\n\n‘Duuuuuuude!’ He exclaimed as he handed me the Ride The Lightning Album “Have you heard these dudes?? They Riiiiipppp!” Me, staring at the cover of some chair being electrocuted, just as stoned as him, ‘Whoah’. And ever since then, I’ve been in the Metallica camp.\n\nRelated: The 5 Best Breakup Songs\n\nAs my career in radio began, I worked in the alternative format, similar to now. Lots of Nirvana, Pearl Jam but also The Cure and Siouxsie and the Banshees. But my love for Metallica never wavered. When I made my way to a straight up ‘buttrock” format, I was able to host the infamous “Mandatory Metallica” feature every night. Believe me, I went off every night. I played Metallica that never gets played on the radio. You think I’m a rebel now? I was off the rails then. I made my current rebellion look like a prayer session in church.\n\nAnd in honor of my off the rails Mandatory Metallica days, I wanna share my opinion of the five best Metallica songs that never get played on the radio (unless my ass is behind the mic).\n\nDisclaimer: For all the Metallica Purist, I’m well aware of the fact that you guys like to debate EVERYTHING Metallica. From music, jeans and haircuts. This is my list. Feel free to make your own. Also, your jeans are outdated. And get a haircut for crying out loud."
