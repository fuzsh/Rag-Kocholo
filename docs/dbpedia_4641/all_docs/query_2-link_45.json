Graduated with honors in Acupuncture, Naturopathic and Chiropractic medicine at National University of Health Sciences.\n\nWhat are you most passionate about professionally? Personally\n\nProfessionally I am passionate about providing my patients with the pathway to meet their health-related goals. Personally, I love learning new things and enjoying life.\n\nWhat three traits define you?\n\nCompassionate, detail oriented, and honest.\n\nWho is your ideal client and why should they connect with you?\n\nMy ideal client is someone who is seeking a natural or alternative solution for their health concern(s). That client would be committed to accepting and following my recommended treatment to improve their health.\n\nWhat’s the biggest proof that you’re good at what you do?\n\nWhen my patients start feeling better, and we resolve their health concerns, and they are able to accomplish more in their daily lives. It’s wonderful when I can see the progress they make, and all of their hard work has paid off.\n\nWhat are you complimented on most in your work?\n\nFor being helpful and competent, I always keep my client’s best interests top of mind.\n\nWhat’s your biggest accomplishment?\n\nI have earned 3 degrees simultaneously over the past 6 years. I’m proud of how much I have learned and grown professionally and personally. I couldn’t have done it without the support of my husband, family and friends.\n\nWhat would you do even if you didn’t get paid to do it?\n\nI would organize everything possible. Organization simplifies my life by making everything easier to find, with less stress, when you need them.\n\nWhat are you surprisingly good at?\n\nI am surprisingly good at swimming. I started swimming at the age of 3 and swam competitively throughout my youth.\n\nWhat’s one thing you couldn’t live without?\n\nI cannot live without tea. I love the smell, taste and comfort. Whether it’s caffeinated tea such as green or black tea or herbal tea like peppermint, chamomile or apple spice. Iced tea during the summer and hot tea during the winter, just love it all!\n\nWhat do you do for fun in your spare time? What are your hobbies?\n\nI spend my spare time with my husband, family or friends. My hobbies include disc golfing with my husband (that’s how we met). I enjoy swimming for exercise and relaxation. I love dining out, going to the movies, listening to music, and going to concerts. Lastly, I enjoy painting portraits, landscapes and abstracts."
