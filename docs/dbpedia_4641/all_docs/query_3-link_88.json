        "text": "Fans were surprised to see Luke Combs give a shoutout to basketball star Caitlin Clark, but that's not the first her name has been linked with country music. Below are three examples showing the new WNBA No. 1 draft pick's love for country music — and the love that country music has in return.\n\nLuke Combs Gave Caitlin Clark a Surprise Congratulations\n\nThe soon-to-be WNBA star was all smiles when she saw her country music hero on screen giving her a sweet message of congratulations.\n\n\"Hey, Luke Combs here, just wanted to say congratulations on being the No. 1 pick in the WNBA draft. That's incredible,\" the country superstar said in his video message. \"I know I can speak for everybody all across the United States and the world that we've enjoyed watching you the last couple of years, and we can't wait to continue to do so. Congratulations, you earned it. Can't wait to see you out there.\"\n\nAfter hearing the kind words from the \"Hurricane\" singer, Clark gushed, \"Luke Combs, that's my favorite artist of all time... that's pretty cool. He's a women's basketball fan, so that's amazing. I was not expecting that.\"\n\nCaitlin Clark LOVES Luke Combs\n\nIt's not the first time that the Iowa basketball star has given a sneak peek into her love for country music — or Combs. When Iowa Everywhere asked in 2023 what music she warms up to, Clark said most people would be surprised that she likes \"calm music\" — and more specifically, country music.\n\nWhen the interviewer asked her favorite artist, she stated that the \"Beautiful Crazy\" singer is her favorite, and she wanted to see him in concert.\n\nTim McGraw Hyped Up Caitlin Clark's Draft Day"
