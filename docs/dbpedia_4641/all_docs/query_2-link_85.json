It felt so beautiful and reminded me, that although my brother had his addictions, he was my angel. . . . Thank you for taking such good care of him and making his memory to me so powerful and beautiful. . . . Your work is profound. From my heart -Cheri”\n\nMy family and I loved that we were offered the option of Parting Stones in place of ashes. We have all decided that our beloved husband, father, and “papaya” (as his granddaughters called him) will be placed in all his favorite places. Thank you so much for allowing us this option… and to keep a part of him close to us always.\n\nHi Nicholas,\n\nI wanted to thank you for your wonderful work in creating the beautiful stones that are my husband. He was born and raised in Sweden, so this summer I traveled to Sweden with many stones to be given to his brothers.\n\nOther stones went to family in California and Delaware; so you can see the impact of your work traveled far and wide.\n\nMost importantly, I carry a perfect stone with me, so I feel he is still a part of me. Thank you!!\n\nDiane\n\nNikki, thank you so much for all that you do. Without these Stones I don't know where I would be mentally. They give me so much peace. I have one around my neck everyday. He is with me. I can hold one in my hands and feel him. Thank you Again Ray\n\nJef, Thank you so much for the beautiful Stones.They are a Wonderful reminder of a life well lived and loved. My honey passed 11-30-21 and these are a very tangible piece of him I can hold or carry around with me. Everyone I know has been told of this gift. Thank you again for giving me peace and comfort. God Bless the WORK you do.\n\nJoni\n\nIt means a lot to me to have something tangible of my husband to keep with me. The stones I received are beautiful - I keep one of them with me always.\n\nThis group keep me notified on the processing of the stones .. they came out beautiful & I’m looking forward to the day I can share them with the out of state family ..\n\nSad is an understatement regarding my son’s sudden death, but I was glad that the option provided by Parting Stone was available. It helped all of his immediate family to have that option.\n\nMy husband was the patriarch of a very loving family. Everyone has a parting stone. I recently received a picture of my great granddaughter, aged 2, holding pap-pap’s stone. It’s like he is still with us.\n\nThank you for the stones that my children and I decided on when my husband was cremated. It beat my expectations. I didn’t know what to expect.\n\nI wondered what to do with my husband‘s remains and found this to be a perfect solution. I was able to share stones with family and friends, who really appreciated it looking out my remaining stones gives me joy when thinking about him."
