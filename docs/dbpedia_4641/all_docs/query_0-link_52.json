        "text": "A-Mac & The Height may call Colorado home, but their music transcends geological borders. Since the band’s inception, A-Mac has carried a torch of diversity and positivity fueled by The Height, which has attracted the attention of a broad range of music lovers and diehard fans. With a unique sound blending reggae, hip-hop, alternative rock and hook laden songwriting, A-Mac & The Height’s music continues to become more eclectic with each release.\n\nThe group's charismatic approach bridges the gap between feel-good energy and conscious thinking, with lyrics that are warm, uplifting and joyful, yet personal and insightful. Formerly known as A-Mac DZ, the band debuted in 2013 and went on to play shows all over the country with well-known acts such as Rusted Root, Kyle Hollingsworth Band (of String Cheese Incident), Wookiefoot and many more. The band also received several accolades, including being nominated “Best Jam Band” by Westword Magazine in 2017 and have been showcased on 97.3 KBCO’s renowned Studio C Sessions.\n\nBringing an energetic and moving live performance to the stage, A-Mac & The Height encourages their audience to experience a genuine and uplifting musical journey with them. The group is also known for their jam band spirit as they create intricate and extended musical passages through improvisation and faith in the unknown. To accomplish all of this correctly, Alex Mackenzie-Low (a.k.a. A-Mac - Lead Vocals & Acoustic Guitar) carefully crafted The Height, consisting of Matt McElwain (Drums), Karl Rivers (Keyboards & Vocals), Stephen Edwards (Bass), Joey Bean (Saxophone & Vocals), Ted Kleist (Lead Guitar & Vocals), and Jake Heym (Percussion).\n\nAs a whole, the band continues to thrive not only in the Colorado music scene, but all over the country, with fans latching onto a beacon of light and happiness in a world operating in negativity.\n\nRead More"
