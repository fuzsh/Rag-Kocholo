        "text": "Songwriter, singer, and musician Guy Clark has been called the “king of the Texas troubadours.” When he moved to Nashville with his wife Susanna in 1971, he became the center of a scene that would ultimately include Rodney Crowell, Emmylou Harris, Rosanne Cash, and Townes Van Zandt – like-minded songwriters who gathered in his home to share food, drink, and new songs. Clark’s distinct, nonconformist style – like those of the artists who surrounded him – would stretch the boundaries of country music in the 1970s and influence a generation of songwriters.\n\nWhen Guy was a little boy in West Texas, his family didn’t own a record player and instead spent their evenings reading poetry aloud to each other, seated around the kitchen table. “I always like the storytelling poets,” he recalled, “like Vachel Lindsay and Stephen Vincent Benét.” Clark got his first guitar in 1958, after his family moved to south Texas, and the first songs he learned were in Spanish, inspired by his father’s law partner, Lola Bonner.\n\nAfter graduating from high school, Guy spent a decade in Houston, where he sang as part of the folk music revival of the 1960s and repaired guitars with his friend, Minor Wilson, for extra cash. In Houston he met Van Zandt and their friendship was immediate. Townes’s compositions inspired Guy to try his hand at writing and the two encouraged each other, listening to recordings of poet Dylan Thomas for inspiration. After brief stints in San Francisco and Los Angeles, all the while honing his songwriting skills, Guy left with Susanna for Nashville and a job with RCA’s publishing division, writing songs. Van Zandt followed shortly thereafter.\n\nHis time in Los Angeles, spent working at a dobro factory and hoping for a publishing deal, inspired his song, “L.A. Freeway,” first recorded by Jerry Jeff Walker in 1972. The song spoke poignantly to the frustration artists experience in the big city, striving to make their dreams a reality, and was Guy’s first hit. Others followed: “Texas, 1947,” “Randall Knife,” “Desperados Waiting for a Train.” In 1982, Ricky Skaggs scored a No. 1 country hit with Clark’s song, “Heartbroke;” the following year, Guy landed on the charts himself with self-penned “Homegrown Tomatoes.” Clark’s compositions would be recorded by dozens of artists over the decades, including George Strait, Kris Kristofferson, Emmylou Harris, Willie Nelson, Johnny Cash, and Vince Gill, who took “Oklahoma Borderline” to the country Top Ten in 1985. Clark was a mentor to aspiring artists and songwriters, including Crowell, Lyle Lovett, Rosanne Cash and Steve Earle, and has been credited with helping create the Americana music genre.\n\nGuy Clark won the 2005 Americana Lifetime Achievement Award for Songwriter and the 2013 Academy of Country Music’s Poet’s Award. He was inducted into the Nashville Songwriters Hall of Fame in 2004. My Favorite Picture of You, his fourteenth and final studio album, won the 2014 GRAMMY Award for Best Folk Album.\n\nBorn: November 6, 1941, Monahans, Texas; Died: May 17, 2016, Nashville, Tennessee"
