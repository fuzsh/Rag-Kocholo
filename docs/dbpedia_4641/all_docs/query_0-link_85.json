        "text": "Sometimes dreamy, frequently haunting, and always with an undercurrent of ‘80s vibe, Austin-based BrainHalo is a combination of 80s/90s alternative rock with a bit of Americana thrown in to roughen up the edges.\n\nThe band has a collective sound that reflects a very diverse group of influences. Their unique sound stems from alternative and 80s bands in their formative years and influences include everything from Depeche Mode to Rush and Wire to Tool.\n\nThe band was formed in 2012 by Brian O'Halloran, John Tipton, Andrew Teekel and Alex Omlanksy after the dissolution of Baptisms for the Dead. BrainHalo history runs deep. It’s the evolution of several bands going back to the 1980s. Brian O'Halloran and John Tipton (both vocals and guitar) met as part of Touch Gallery in 1988.\n\nAfter disbanding in 1994, Brian and John formed Drowning Man, evolving their techno style into a more alternative guitar-oriented rock band. In 2001, John, Brian and Lance Kinney formed One Thirty Nine. They produced \"Into the Darkness\" (2003) and \"Consolation Prize\" (2010). In 2012, the band reformed as BrainHalo to honor new members of the band. Clark Hamilton joined in 2018 as drummer.\n\nWhat Are We Up to Now?\n\nBrainHalo released their latest full-length album \"Ruminator\" in 2020. The band continues to play and record in Austin, Texas and have ranked consistently in the top 10 regionally on Reverbnation. To keep up with the band, you can find them here:\n\nInstagram @brainhalo https://www.instagram.com/brainhalo\n\nFacebook https://www.facebook.com/brainhalo\n\nitunes https://geo.music.apple.com/us/artist/brainhalo/886444583?mt=1&app=music\n\nSpotify https://open.spotify.com/artist/73lWhILvoagjqhJFgkXUQc?si=0VlVDK00QiSmuyeoAUUskw\n\nYouTube https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCGW6uRk5uoL0-YaqvDySTNg/videos\n\nAmazon-music https://www.amazon.com/s?k=brainhalo&i=digital-music\n\nMeet Brain Halo\n\nJohn\n\nConceived and raised in Germany, John learned to play guitar in high school. He was influenced by a killer collection of 80s bands: The Police, Rush, Depeche Mode, Talk Talk, Souxie and the Banshees, Pink Floyd and the Cure. He first started playing in the Touch Gallery in 1987. In addition to his lead guitar and vocals work, John collaborates with Brian on songwriting. John has been playing in various bands in Austin since 1987.\n\nRaised in the High Plains, Clark listened to mostly top 40 and country as a kid. His parents enrolled him in non-consensual piano lessons to avoid total destruction of the family’s furniture and kitchen utensils! Early influences for Clark were Phil Collins, Ginger Baker, Neil Peart and Bill Bruford (still his fave). The 1980s gave Clark his very own Sharp transistor radio. He says he was really grabbed by a particular type of drummer - Ginger Baker in Cream, Neil Peart in Rush, Phil Collins in Genesis, Bill Bruford in Yes. Clark credits Stewart Copeland and Terry Bozzio as some of the drum gods he worshipped. In the latter half of the 80s, Clark attended college in Lawrence, Kansas (which had an unexpected quality college radio station) and became immersed in alternative and college rock. He came to Austin in the early 1990s and has been playing ever since."
