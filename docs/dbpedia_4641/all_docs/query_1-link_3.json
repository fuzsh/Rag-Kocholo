I think I’d have fared a lot better in the 1950s, 1970s, or maybe 1980s than I did growing up in the 1990s. I didn’t understand popular music or a lot of the rest of pop culture. I know all the references in this song, and I often wonder how things would’ve been if I’d been born even just 10 years earlier. Additionally, the song lists a lot of different pop culture icons, and I like lists in songs.\n\nThe Clarks are considered to be alternative rock or garage rock, and I think both or either is fitting. They definitely have a bit of an unrefined sound and have even been referred to as out-of-tune country hicks. They have released 11 albums, and their most recent record, Madly in Love at the End of the World, was released earlier this year. “Born Too Late” was a track on their 2000 release, Let It Go."
