Details to be announced.\n\n\"Alternative music is music that hasn't yet achieved a mainstream audience, Alternative isn't new wave any more, it's a disposition of mind. Alternative music is any kind of music that has the potential to reach a wider audience. It also has real strength, real quality, real excitement, and it has to be socially significant.\"\n\n—Mark Josephson, Executive Director of the New Music Seminar, 1988\n\nNo pablum.\n\nNo pretense.\n\nPure appreciation.\n\nAuthentic experiences.\n\nHelp Us Build Alt Hall™\n\nCurator of Controlled Chaos™"
