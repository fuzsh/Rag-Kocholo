        "text": "R&B, Blues, Soul, Rock, Jazz, Funk. These are the musical styles tastefully blended by The Michael Clark Band featuring Tracy Clark — sometimes in the same song!\n\nIn the classic tradition of The Ike and Tina Turner Revue, the band incorporates many different musical styles into their show. Powerful vocals and tight musical arrangements are trademarks of every performance. This is music you can dance to as well as listen to. There are no “set” set lists; the band generally starts with an instrumental then Tracy takes the stage and look out! Whether honoring the original rendition of a classic number or performing an original tune, the music is presented in the band’s own funky style.\n\nAlthough the band has been in existence since 1991, things changed dramatically when Tracy came on board in 1996. What started as a blues/rock guitar band evolved into an all-out R&B revue. Tracy’s vocals, stage presence, and attitude coupled with one of the tightest rhythm sections in the area is guaranteed to move anyone. Add one of the funkiest horn sections on the East Coast and you have all the elements for a great musical experience.\n\nMichael Clark Band — Songlist\n\nR&B\n\nHard to Handle – Otis Redding\n\nCan’t Turn You Loose – Otis Redding\n\nMidnight Hour – Wilson Pickett\n\nLand of 1000 Dance – Wilson Pickett\n\nCissy Strut – The Meters\n\nHold On, I’m Comin’ – Sam & Dave\n\n634-5789 – Sam & Dave\n\nGroove Me – King Floyd\n\nGet Ready – The Temptations\n\nCan’t Get Next To You –\n\nThe Temptations\n\nShakey Ground – The Temptations\n\nNight Time Is The Right Time – Aretha Franklin\n\nFeelgood – Aretha Franklin\n\nChain of Fools – Aretha Franklin\n\nAin’t No Sunshine – Bill Withers\n\nIt’s Your Thing – The Isley Brothers\n\nDance With Me – Rufus/Chaka Khan\n\nNatural Woman – Aretha Franklin\n\nLet’s Get It On – Marvin Gaye\n\nSexual Healing – Marvin Gaye\n\nWho’s Makin Love – Johnnie Taylor\n\nLet’s Stay Together – Al Green\n\nLove & Happiness – Al Green\n\nMustang Sally – Wilson Pickett\n\nProud Mary – Ike & Tina Turner\n\nClean-Up Woman – Betty Wright\n\nKnock On Wood – Eddie Floyd\n\nSigned, Sealed, Delivered – Stevie Wonder\n\nDock of The Bay – Otis Redding\n\nPlay That Funky Music White Boy – Wild Cherry\n\nBLUES\n\nDownhome Blues – ZZ Hill\n\nI’m Tore Down – Freddie King /\n\nEric Clapton\n\nBaby What You Want Me To Do – Jimmie Reed\n\nHow Blue Can You Get – B.B.
