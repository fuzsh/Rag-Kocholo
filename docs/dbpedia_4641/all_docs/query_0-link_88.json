        "text": "The London-based singer-songwriter Mick J. Clark has a new single out, and it’s a pretty great love song.\n\nIf you’ve been in work mode all afternoon and had your ears on, you deserve to be rewarded. Take a break, relax, and reward yourself with an awesome piece of music from the United Kingdom. The track ‘This Moment’ is perfect for the weekend!\n\nWho doesn’t love a good pop song? Everyone’s looking for that latest and greatest hip, fun, and catchy song to add to their playlist.\n\nI was one of them. That’s probably why I’ve found myself sticking so close to the most popular music on the radio stations because that’s where the homies at.\n\nBut now we are all into indie artists, and besides preparing a playlist for love songs, we are including this one, which is described by the artists as music for saying goodbye, ending with the words ‘I loved you so’. Who never needed to say goodbye?\n\nYou can listen to our full playlist which contains the artist’s music, and know more about his work by scrolling down the page.\n\nSinger-songwriter Mick J. Clark has been signed to the Sonorus Record Company and has written over 60 songs, 40 of which are currently being played all over the world. Clark has been signed to the Sonorus Record Company for the past 10 years.\n\nIt was Clark’s song “We Know It’s True” that reached the No. 3 spot on the iTunes Rock Chart back in March of 2020. Additionally, he has two songs on the release ‘Goa Chillout Zone Vol 9’, which reached No. 1 on the Electronic Chart at the beginning of 2020.\n\nDuring the course of his career, the artist played on many radio stations and released three albums and three EPs, entitled ‘Notes 1, 2, 3,4,5, and 6’.\n\nIn the past year, his work reached over half a million streams. This included a song about a sunny holiday, ‘Anuther Sunny Huliday’, which was streamed well over 100,000 times. With the three Christmas songs on Clark’s EP, the EP received more than 200,000 streams.\n\nMick J. Clark‘s single This Moment is a perfect pick-me-up if you’re feeling like life is just too hard. It’s a beautiful song, and Clark’s voice is like a breath of fresh air. The featured female voice is also angelical and we just found it the perfect match too.\n\nThe song is a mixture of commercial pop, contemporary pop, Latin pop and easy listening style with an acoustic guitar as the main instrument. It has an uplifting melody and will make you want to sing along at the top of your lungs.\n\nMick J. Clark is an artist from Croydon who has been working in the UK indie scene for years. So his experience creating music for evoking emotions is vast.\n\nIt’s the kind of song that makes you want to just sit back and relax, with your feet up and a glass of wine in your hand. It’s the kind of song that feels like it was made for you, whether it was or not.\n\nThis Moment is one of those songs that just makes everything better, no matter what’s going on in your life at the time. If you’re having a bad day, this song will make it better. If you’re having a great day, this song will make it even better!\n\nMick J. Clark is from England, and it’s a country with an amazing culture of soft rock songs that are infectious, so this is one of them and we just loved it.
