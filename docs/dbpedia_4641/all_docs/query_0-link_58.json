        "meta_description": "Next Best Thing by the james clark institute, released 07 May 2021\n\nSo I see you’ve had your eye on the prize, \r\nAnd I have familiarized myself with your plight.\r\nSometimes you need a plan B to survive.\r\nStrategically, a plan C D E F G.\r\n\r\nThen if let me be your next best thing. Let me be your next best thing.\r\nYour hips will swerve, your mood will swing.\r\nYour lips won’t purse and your dopamine will offer up an extra gleam,\r\nIf you let me be your next best thing.\r\n\r\nSo I agree you were the one with the know how.\r\nSo how did things get so sour?\r\nWhen you would work the room for hours.\r\nBut when things stop working out like it’s supposed to be,\r\nIt’s plan C D E F G.\r\n\r\nThen if let me be your next best thing. Let me be your next best thing.\r\nYour hips will swerve, your mood will swing.\r\nYour lips won’t perse and your dopamine will offer up an extra gleam,\r\nIf you let me be your next best thing.\r\n\r\nI know you don’t want to settle for any substitute.\r\nBut oh look over my credentials, I studied at the Institute\r\nOf next best times and I’m the next in line and you’re sure to surmise,\r\nThat it cannot be disputed....I’m your next best thing!\r\n\r\nSo when you’ve had the chance to ponder it,\r\nThen we’ll revise the script and the twists and turns and the lines.\r\nNow you’ve memorized it, don’t be surprised if it’s take 1 2 3 4 5!\r\n\r\nThen if let me be your next best thing. Let me be your next best thing.\r\nYour hips will swerve, your moods will swing.\r\nYour lips won’t purse and your submarine will emerge in Pleasant Stream,\r\nIf you let me be your next best thing.\r\n\r\nYour next best thing. Your next best thing. Your next best thing.\r\nOh oh oh your next best thing.",
