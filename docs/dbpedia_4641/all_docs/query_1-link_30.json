        "text": "A collaborative learning environment where students, staff, and families are challenged, healthy, engaged, safe, and supported.\n\nClarkston Community Schools is a highly regarded school district with an enrollment of approximately 6,500 students. We have seven elementary schools (K-5), one middle school serving grades 6-7, one junior high for grades 8-9, and Clarkston High School, which serves students in grades 10-12. We also have a virtual academy, an Early Childhood Center serving children ages 3-5, and an alternative high school/community education facility.\n\nOur students are well-prepared for a future that excites them, and believe that they can achieve their dreams. Our community embraces that students are unique and that each child can achieve their personal best. We strive to meet our studentsâ€™ individual needs through whole-person development, foundational and academic skills, student-focused learning, and focusing on future pathways."
