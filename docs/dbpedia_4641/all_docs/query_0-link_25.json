        "text": "Free the Honey\n\nJune 11th and July 9th: Free the Honey, 6-9pm, Crested Butte, Colorado\n\nSomeday when these guys were enormously famous, we will get to say they were once our \"house band\". They will wow the whole world one day, but for now, we get to host them. 3 part harmonies, ever-changing instruments, über talent, and original music.\n\nJune 13th: Erin and the Project, 6-9pm, Missoula, MT\n\nTHE CHUCKLESS WAGONSJune 20th, The Chuckless Wagons, 6-9pm Crested Butte, CO\n\nThe acoustic alter-ego of Ryan Herr and TylerLucas from local ski-funk band band Mine Control. Their music is stripped down and acoustic featuring mandolin and guitar. Sharing a love for musical conversation, their playful weaving of trickling melodies and pulsing rhythms will put the groove in your grass. They perform a range of traditional music from classic American troubadours and add a Crested Butte twist consistent with the unique character only found above 8,000 feet in the West Elk Mountains. Joining them is Mollie Hull, who contributes her venerable vocal harmonies and guitar playing.\n\nJune 25th, July 2nd, August 19th, Rachel van Slyke,\n\nBen Powell\n\nJune 26th, Ben Powell, 6-9pm San Diego, CA Ben Powell makes his way through this world like a one man band of years past, but with a fresh, new, vibrant sound. Ben has created a truly unique sound playing his resonator guitars, stomping on a homemade winebox footboard, playing rack-harmonica, and singing his old style blues and his original tunes about any issues of the day.\n\nJune 28th, Sweetwater String Band, 6-9pm, High Sierras, CA SweetwaterStringBand delivers an original highly danceable bluegrass sound featuring cello, mandolin, guitar, and upright bass.\n\nJuly 1-2, Ryan Flores, 6-9pm Ontario, CanadaRYAN FLORES\n\nThis performer has been one of our absolute favorites of the last year. He is wildly talented!!! Ryan is an independent musician, singer, and songwriter from Toronto, Ontario. He is well known for his veryuplifting, honest, and relatable original music, most of which revolve around the genres of pop, R & B, acoustic, and some contemporary folk. We like to think of him as Balkan vamp. He is mainly inspired by artists who sing on a more inspirational, personal, and original level.\n\nKYLE TKyle T or Kyle Dewitt Tischler is a 21 year old Country artist from Carnesville, Georgia, currently based out of Durango, CO area, who started playing music at age 6 after hearing the famous \"Hank Williams\" song, \"Hey Good Looking\". Kyle has a versatile style heavily influenced by country music. His deep voice and skill on the guitar make him versatile to take on any genre he chooses.\n\nJuly 30, Michael Shay Trio, 6-9pm Quito, Equador\n\nWith the nuance of a classically-trained musician, the grit of a musical globe-trotter, and just enough twang to know he's from Texas, Michael Shay's folk and alt-country songwriting sensibilities reflect a vision comfortably outside any \"Americana\" box while poetically evoking his earliest influences: Townes Van Zandt, Neil Young, Dylan, and the Dead.\n\nBorn in Austin, currently based in Quito, Ecuador, Michael Shay has spent twenty years exploring countless musical traditions in far-flung countries, which finally him back to performing his own rootsy Americana originals as part of the trio that will visit Montanya.\n\nMichael Shay Trio\n\nJuly 31, Candy Lee, 6-9pm Fayetteville, Arkansas.\n\nCandy Lee is an award winning, \"golden voiced\" singer/songwriter who combines her love for folk, jazz, and indie music to create her own original style. The first thing you'll notice when you hear Candy Lee is her voice- timeless, entrancing, and ethereal. She pulls you in with her sweet, catchy melodies and moving music, but it is her smart, creative lyrics that deserve a second listen.\n\nAugust 1st (and sponsored by Montanya Distillers at the Crested Butte Arts Festival Caravan Bar!)\n\nRoma Ransom, 6-9pm (and at other times through the weekend) from Colorado Springs, CO\n\nGrace Easley and Gordon Lewis have been playing music together now for almost two years. They met in Springfield, Missouri while Grace Easley and her friend were busking and Gordon showed up in a pedicab with a banjo. After this, the two got to know each other and went on to become Roma Ransom, which has an original gypsy caravan sound.\n\nAugust 8th, The Clarks, 6-9pm Boulder, CO THE CLARKS\n\nOriginal semi-acoustic folk, blues and rock. THE CLARKS is a Boulder-based trio, named for CLARK’S QUARK (n.), a theoretical but as yet undiscovered subatomic particle postulated by the great Polish/Native American physicist Clark Blzgyqzckrpgvki (Indian name ‘Empty Vial’), whose anticipated properties are (i) it is destroyed at the same instant it is created and (ii) when placed in a solution of alcohol and stimulated by energy emits coherent sound waves of unimaginable power and beauty. Along with the Higgs Boson, discovery of the Clark’s Quark is one of the last great problems in modern physics."
