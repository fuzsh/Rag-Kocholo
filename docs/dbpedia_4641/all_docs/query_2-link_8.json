I know there is a leader out there who is willing to give her a shot. Dear Yoddit ‚Äì my page is yours. This community is going to show up for you in a BIG way today. We especially need y'all in TEXAS! üôè _________________ Hi everyone, My name is Yoddit McLean and I‚Äôm incredibly grateful to take over Nate's LinkedIn page. My father was Jamaican and my mother is Ethiopian, and both my parents worked extremely hard to learn new skills to provide a better future for our family. Following their example, I've managed to achieve similar success as a professional in the Salesforce ecosystem. I‚Äôm proud to say I am 4x certified in Salesforce and have over 15 years experience in CRM consulting and systems administration. As a single mother, my three amazing boys mean the world to me. Jahsiah, my middle child, is passionate about dance and art; Dasiris is a gamer who loves animals; and Ermias, my youngest, is still exploring his interests. Whatever they choose, I am determined to support and nurture their passions, giving them the best possible opportunities for greatness. I am currently looking for remote or hybrid roles in the Dallas, Texas area specializing in: ‚ÄìSalesforce Administration ‚ÄìCRM Consulting ‚ÄìSystems Administration I‚Äôm also open to freelance and consulting work, as I have extensive experience with small to medium size businesses of various industries. My colleagues and friends describe me as dedicated, hardworking and adaptable. I thrive on challenges and am always eager to learn and grow. Thank you for reading. I appreciate Nate and all of you so much for your time and support. Feel free to message me directly on LinkedIn if you know of any opportunities or simply want to connect. Cheers, Yoddit #opentowork #salesforce #CRM #administration"
