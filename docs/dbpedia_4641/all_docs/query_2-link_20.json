        "text": "‚ÄúKill-Cody‚Äù is an Alternative Rock Project Created by Los Angeles Based Musican Cody John Clark. I promise you there is a song for you written by this artist that you will want to blast in your headphones at every free minute.\n\nhttps://open.spotify.com/artist/1HmjrwbGV6qUa9upW1FyA3?si=3zeYzaUpSF26BDaaHmwwsg\n\nI will admit, I‚Äôve known Cody for a few years but never listen to his Rock Project ‚ÄúKill-Cody‚Äù until recently, and believe me when I say I‚Äôve absolutely been missing out!!The song I will being writing a review on ‚ÄúI Fucking Hate You‚Äù has a 80‚Äôs/90‚Äôs punk vibe which I love! But if punk isn‚Äôt your thing then I suggest you listen to ‚ÄúOn Fire‚Äù which has a pop rock vibe or ‚ÄúDead To Me‚Äù which feels very grunge to me, which I love all these songs because they remind me of my teenage days in the 90‚Äôs listening to music with the same vibe.\n\nI was told to pick which ever song I would like to write a review on and man let me tell you it was so hard to choose between all these amazing tracks, it was more like a eeny, meeny, miny, moe type of thing lol\n\nSo most people that know me, know I try to stay away from negative people, energies and such, but with song ‚ÄúI Fucking Hate You‚Äù, it‚Äôs not the most positive message, but at the same time we are people full of many emotions and anger and frustration being just a couple of them. And at the same time its hard to love everyone especially if you‚Äôve been hurt by them in one way or another and if that sound familiar to you then this will be a song you can relate to and I‚Äôm sure it will be a favorite.\n\nThis song starts with something other than music, I won‚Äôt give it away because I really want you to listen to it üòâbut once the music starts all I can say is wow! Guitars start with a basic riff then drums start and the guitar starts to pick up and even though it‚Äôs punky, the guitar riffs give it a mixture of punk and grunge for sure! So not only is this song good to rock out to, but it‚Äôs a good song to vent to as well, and when you read lyrics below you will completely understand! I also want to mention that these songs are very catchy and you will learn the entire song after just a couple times of listening to it, plus its addicting!\n\nLyrics:\n\nI fucking hate you, fucking hate you , fucking hate you\n\nYou‚Äôre Always running your mouth, no one likes you in this town\n\nI fucking hate you, fucking hate you, fucking hate you\n\nYou‚Äôre always running your mouth, no one likes you in this town\n\nWe‚Äôre gonna fight all night, we‚Äôre gonna fight all night\n\nLet me tell you how it‚Äôs gonna be, you can‚Äôt fuck with me\n\nLet me tell you how it‚Äôs gonna be, you can‚Äôt kill Cody\n\nFor more info on this amazing Rock project, from music, news and more please click on links below\n\nhttps://www.facebook.com/killcodyalternative/about/?ref=page_internal\n\nhttp://www.killcody.com\n\nPeace, Love and Music"
