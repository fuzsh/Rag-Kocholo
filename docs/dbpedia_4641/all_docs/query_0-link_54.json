        "text": "Second Single Out Now From Texas Parks and Wildlife Foundation Album Project\n\nAustin, Texas – July 6, 2023 – (TPWF), which launched the Texas Wild album project in May, announced today the release of its second single, “Possum Kingdom,” performed by Ryan Bingham and The Texas Gentlemen. “Possum Kingdom,” originally by Texas natives Toadies, is the second single release for Texas Wild, with the third anticipated release coming in August 2023, plus a digital and limited-edition vinyl release coming in Fall 2023. “Possum Kingdom” is available now on Spotify, Apple Music and Amazon Music. To listen to the single click here.\n\n“Possum Kingdom” was originally written and released by the Texas-based alternative rock band Toadies as the second single of their 1994 album. The song would become the band’s most successful and well-known release. Toadies originally formed in Fort Worth, with a style that was frequently described as “distinctly Texas.” Almost 30 years later, the Texas Wild version aims to honor this fan-favorite while adding elements of blues, rock and country in a new musical arrangement produced by Texas singer-songwriter Walker Lukens, with vocals from Ryan Bingham and backing band The Texas Gentlemen.\n\n“Ryan Bingham wanting to do ‘Possum Kingdom’ is exactly what makes an album like this special; a big artist in one genre taking a chance by doing a popular song in another genre,” said producer Walker Lukens. “Plus, Richard Bowden’s fiddle solo is one of the coolest things that’s ever happened at our studio.”\n\n“Ryan Bingham and The Texas Gentleman bring their own style to the tune, imbuing it with a uniquely haunting touch. A lurid and chaotic violin pairs with the guitars creating an original appeal. This is a great cover that takes the song to new places,” said Toadies guitarist Clark Vogeler.\n\n“I love how Ryan made the tune his own, really brought out the swampy, gritty vibe. Cool stuff,” said Vaden Todd Lewis, the Toadies’ lead singer.\n\nThe Texas Wild album exclusively features Texas musicians, both well-known and rising stars, as they pay tribute to classic Texas tunes. The album blends traditional Texas genres like blues, cumbia and country with modern sounds like hip-hop, R&B and electronica. The album is sponsored by notable Texas brands Rambler Sparkling Water and Tecovas. The release also features a unique, block-print-style artwork by Texas illustrator Mishka Westell. Butler, a branding studio in Austin, also collaborated on the project’s concept and design.\n\n“We knew the possibilities were endless when we set out to make this album of cool covers, but never in our wildest dreams did we think Ryan Bingham would ask to cover Toadies,” said Phil Lamb, TPWF’s Director of Philanthropy, who is leading the project. “Ryan’s passion for the song shines through, and we’re thrilled that the Toadies have joined our album lineup with a Kelly Clarkson cover that we’ll share when the album drops later this year.”\n\nA full track listing will be available closer to the album release, but tracks include:\n\nFat Tony featuring Paul Wall – “(Hey Baby) Que Paso”\n\nOriginal Track: Sir Douglas Quintet\n\nThe Texas Gentlemen – “(That’s Right) You’re Not From Texas”\n\nOriginal Track: Lyle Lovett\n\nShane Smith and The Saints featuring Hayes Carll – “Pancho and Lefty”\n\nOriginal Track: Townes Van Zandt\n\nLuna Luna – “Si Una Vez”\n\nOriginal Track: Selena Quintanilla\n\nRyan Bingham – “Possum Kingdom”\n\nOriginal Track: Toadies\n\nThe Suffers – “My Maria”\n\nOriginal Track: B.W.
