        "text": "LLTM: Is there a special meaning or back story on how the band got its name?\n\nJaycee: The band name came from us sitting in the rehearsal space tossing around words and phrases we liked until we settled on “A Light Divided.” To me, the name is symbolic of the light and darkness in our lives and emotions while musically reflecting the ability to showcase both our heavier and softer sides\n\nLLTM: Who have been some of your biggest musical influences and can we hear any similarities?\n\nJaycee: My biggest influences in this band have always been A Day to Remember and Bring Me The Horizon because I admire how they’re always willing to take risks in their music. I love how they never conform that what their “genre” should be or feel boxed into any particular sound\n\nLLTM: What has been the hardest part about being in the music industry today? What about the easiest?\n\nJaycee: The hardest part is finding way to cut through the noise when there is SO much music out there and attention spans are shorter than ever. On the flip side, it’s never been easier to find success as an independent artist. We have access to so many great tools that bands can blow themselves up without the help of labels.\n\nLLTM: When you listen to music, do you connect more with the lyrics or the instrumental side?\n\nJaycee: I’m a lyrics girly through and through.\n\nLLTM: Who is currently on your playlist, and what song could you never get tired of?\n\nJaycee: I’m currently obsessed with deathbyromy. So, she’s been crushing my playlist lately. The song “I feel like a God” in particular is the one I listen to when I’m getting pumped to go on stage. I’ve also been loving Charlotte Sand’s new EP.\n\nLLTM: Who has been that person in your life you have always looked up to and why?\n\nJaycee: I will probably be criticized to death, but Taylor Swift has been the epitome of a strong woman handling her business in an industry that does it’s best to tear her down. Everything she does from taking control of owning her masters, to fighting for artists to make more money through streaming, to performing 3+ hour long sets in the rain to gifting her staff and charities hundreds of thousands of dollars is all super inspiring.\n\nLLTM: What do you hope the fans get out of your music?\n\nJaycee: I hope they find a sense of connection and community. That’s what I was searching for when I started this band, so I hope that comes across.\n\nLLTM: If you had to give up something for 30 days to perform with any artist/band for 1 hour, what would you give up and who would you be performing with?\n\nJaycee: I say in every interview that I am actively manifesting performing with ADTR so…I would give up my great love (coffee) for 30 days to make that happen even though I’m sure it would make me miserable to be around.\n\nLLTM: Where do you hope to see yourself in 5 years and what will it take to get there?\n\nJaycee: I hope to see myself continuing to make music that I’m proud of and hopefully touring the world so I can better connect with the people who support what I do.\n\nLLTM: What is the most influential quote or saying for you and why?\n\nJaycee: “Keep your hopes up high, and your head down low” For me it’s an important reminder to stay optimistic and keep your eyes on the prize, but it’s equally as important to stay humble, work hard and to not let yourself get distracted by opinions or ego.\n\nLLTM: Has the writing or recording process began for a new EP/Album, if so when can the fans expect it to be released?\n\nJaycee: We’ve done a lot of writing since 2020 and while a full album is the ultimate goal, we’re focusing on dropping one single at a time. It’s been fun being able to dive deep with our audience what each songs means and give each one it’s moment to shine.\n\nLLTM: What does the touring schedule look like for 2023?\n\nJaycee: We’ve got a few tricks up our sleeve for the rest of the year. we’re really excited to get back on the road for our group therapy sessions.\n\nFor more information on “A Light Divided” from music, news and more click on link below https://www.facebook.com/ALightDivided"
