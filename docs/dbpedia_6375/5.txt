The World, the Flesh, and the Devil (dir. Ranald MacDougall, 1959) stars Harry Belafonte as Ralph Burton, the last man on earthâ€¦that is, until he meets a white woman played by Inger Stevens. Shot on location in New York City and featuring empty streets that resemble our current pandemic crisis, the film confronts racism in a way that is rare for a science fiction film and incredibly relevant for the contemporary moment.
