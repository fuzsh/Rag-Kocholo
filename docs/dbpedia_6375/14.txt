In The World, the Flesh and the Devil (Ranald MacDougall, 1959, 95 min), on-location film production in post-war New York meets mid-century apocalyptic science fiction. Shot on location throughout the city, and featuring empty streets that recall recent pandemic scenes, the film confronts racism in a direct way that is rare for a Cold War era sci-fi film at the time. The film was adapted from the 1901 speculative fiction novel "The Purple Cloud" by Caribbean-British author M. P. Shiel, and stars Inger Stevens, Mel Ferrer, and the late, great activist and entertainer Harry Belafonte.

Introduced by Carmen Perez-Jordan, President/Chief Executive Officer of The Gathering for Justice, a social justice organization founded in 2005 by Belafonte dedicated to shifting culture toward justice in the criminal legal system.

This screening is part of our year-long series, New York on Film: Decade by Decade, programmed by Jessica Green. The series accompanies the Museum's centennial exhibition, This Is New York: 100 Years of the City in Art and Pop Culture.
