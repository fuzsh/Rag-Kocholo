        "text": ">\n\nAn African-American miner named Ralph Burton (Harry Belafonte), survives the widespread effects of “atomic poison” in the atmosphere because he is trapped in a cave-in beneath the Earth’s surface when the war occurs. After Ralph discovers a path to the surface, he learns from newspaper headlines that nuclear war has wiped out almost all animal life on the planet. He is alone.\n\nThese scenes, lensed in the early mornings and in extreme long shot are completely convincing and discomforting.\n\nSpecifically, the plot revolves around a black man, Ralph, a white woman named Sarah (Inger Stevens), and a white man named Ben (Mel Ferrer). And they all keep circling around one inevitable, inescapable conclusion. If the “old” and traditional ways are to be respected and followed, Sarah can only be with one man; and she can never be with a black man. Even if she prefers Ralph to Ben.\n\nIn the end, the white man, Ben, is even willing to launch what he callously terms “World War IV” to re-establish the rules of yesteryear; threatening to murder Ralph if he doesn’t flee town and leave Ben to his would-be bride.\n\nThis visual conclusion is wholly suggestive, as many critics have noted, of a new world order that eschews violence, war and racism and encourages…polygamy.\n\nDesperate for company, he brings two department store mannequins back to his apartment in the city, and promptly names them Snodgrass and Betsy.\n\nBoth mannequins are white and Ralph quickly develops a kind of love-hate relationship with Snodgrass (the male mannequin) over his (imaginary) treatment of Betsy. After one especially contentious conversation Ralph has had enough of Snodgrass, and actually throws the mannequin over the ledge in his apartment. The mannequin crashes to the street below and is destroyed.\n\nIt is neither difficult, nor inappropriate to read the sequence with the mannequins as one that deliberately foreshadows Ralph’s experience with Sarah and Ben. He literally “kills” Snodgrass in defense of Betsy’s honor, and later almost succumbs to Ben’s war-to-the-death over “possession” of Sarah.\n\nBut in some way, Ralph manages to make a different choice in that real-life, climactic scenario; impelled in part, perhaps, by his reading of an inspirational quote in United Nations Plaza. Ralph throws down his rifle and refuses to kill Ben — the real life Snodgrass — lest he repeat the mistakes of the world, and, finally, Sarah brings the two men together. But the important thing to consider here is that Ralph is able, at least in some way, to release his built-up sense of hatred and oppression on the inanimate Snodgrass, not on the living, breathing Ben.\n\nAnd that hatred is a result — without mincing words — of the racism of the culture. Ralph is acutely conscious of matters of race, and keeps bringing race up to Sarah even as they become friends. After her first, hostile words — “don’t touch me,” the couple nonetheless builds a bond of real friendship, but Ralph always, very carefully monitors his “place” in relationship to her. On Sarah’s birthday, for instance, Ralph fixes a fancy dinner for her at a chic restaurant…but then notes that the help doesn’t dine with the patrons. You can see that this comment breaks her heart.\n\nInterestingly then, Ralph — a victim of the old social construct — remains trapped in that construct to a much more significant degree than Sarah does. She is occasionally insensitive about matters of race, at one point noting arrogantly that she is “free, white and 21.” But Sarah also admonishes Ralph to be “bold” when cutting her hair, a line that clearly holds a double meaning for her. What Sarah is saying is that she wants and desires Ralph to make the first move.\n\nWhen Ralph reminds Sarah that he is “colored,” Sarah’s encouraging response is “You’re a fine, decent man and that’s all I need to know.” Although Sarah often appears weak and frail in the early portions of the film, she is actually stronger than Ralph in one critical sense. She is ready to lay down the past (and old traditions) to live happily in the present with the man she loves. This is something that Ralph, for the longest time can’t seem to do.\n\nReally, Ralph is caught in a terrible bind. The way he deals with the death of the world at large is trying to re-build it. We witness him making a radio station operational, and restoring power to various apartment buildings with a portable generator. Ralph also collects books and paintings in his apartment, so that the beauty of the old world is not lost.\n\nIn other words, Ralph keeps attempting to deny the new world order and restore the old one. But this is strangely unproductive in a personal sense. For if Ralph restores the old world — the world he lived in before the bombs fell — than he must also restore the old, racist ways and ultimately lose Sarah to Ben. Ralph can’t rebuild the old world and make a new world with Sarah. He has to choose one or the other.\n\nThe least developed character in the film is likely Mel Ferrer’s Ben, who arrives in the late second act, just when Sarah and Ralph are finally growing close.\n\nBen rather blatantly represents the old world social constructs in that he immediately resorts to violence and killing; the very things that turned our planet to a cemetery. Unlike Ralph, Ben does not take his anger out on inanimate though symbolic objects of his hatred like the mannequins, but upon Ralph himself. He takes up a rifle and nearly kills Ralph.\n\nIf Ralph represents “the world;” man’s indomitable drive to bring civilization back from the precipice and wilderness, and Sarah — with her longing for Ralph and human intimacy — represents “the flesh,” then certainly, in some fashion, Ben is definitively “The Devil” of the film’s title. He sees only what he wants: — Sarah — and his obstacles to taking her, namely Ralph.\n\nThe action in the film resolves not when the well-armed white man says it should; not even when another man, Ralph, refuses to kill Ben (having acted out his murderous urges on Snodgrass). Rather, the action resolves in the film when Sarah, a woman, steps up and asserts her choice."
