        "text": "Harry Belafonte in THE WORLD, THE FLESH AND THE DEVIL is available on Blu-ray From Warner Archive. Order it HERE\n\n“Millions Flee from Cities! End of the World!” From a Manhattan skyscraper, Ralph Burton (Harry Belafonte) surveys the emptiness announced by that chilling newspaper headline. Nuclear doomsday has come. Ralph is sure he is the last person alive. Then, a woman (Inger Stevens) appears and the two form a cautious friendship that’s threatened when a third survivor (Mel Ferrer) arrives. Unlike other postapocalyptic thrillers, from The Time Machine to I Am Legend, there are no external monsters to battle here. Instead, the monsters – fear, intolerance, jealousy – lurk inside the all-too human beings. And heightening the intensity of writer/director Ranald MacDougall’s suspenseful and unsettling movie are stunning vistas of unpopulated New York: vast, empty and soulless.\n\nNuclear doomsday has come. Ralph (Harry Belafonte) is sure he is the last person alive. Then a woman (Inger Stevens) appears and the two form a cautious friendship that¹s threatened when a third survivor (Mel Ferrer) arrives. There are no external monsters to battle in this urban apocalypse landscape. Instead, the monsters – fear, intolerance, jealousy – lurk within the human heart. Suspenseful and unsettling, The World, The Flesh and The Devil proved a seminal “last man” movie that is both prescient and powerful. Loaded with stunning vistas of an unpopulated New York City, its visual influence ripples on down though a diverse series of successors such as Omega Man and The Quiet Earth, while its forthright confrontation of racial and sexual politics is both surprising and inspiring. Screenwriter/Director Ranald MacDougall’s (Mildred Pierce, Dark of the Sun) Sci-Fi stunner is reborn, thanks to this crisp and crackling 1080p presentation in glorious Black and White. 16×9 Letterbox"
