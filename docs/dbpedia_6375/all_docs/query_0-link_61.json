        "text": "EDITOR’S NOTE: The World, The Flesh and the Devil was on the CBS Late Movie on March 29 and September 18, 1972; May 13, 1974 and January 27, 1976.\n\nBased on The Purple Cloud by M. P. Shiel and the story “End of the World” by Ferdinand Reyher, this was directed and written by Ranald MacDougall, who also wrote Mildred Pierce.\n\nSaint Thomas Aquinas — in his third objection to “prudence of the flesh” being a sin in Summa Theologica — said, “just as man is tempted by the flesh, so too is he tempted by the world and the devil.” That forms the title of the film, as these three are the enemies of man.\n\nHarry Belafonte’s production company Harbel Productions wanted to create more movies that would promote an African-American representation in Hollywood that was more authentic. This was the first movie they produced. Yet by the end of the film, he and his co-stars Inger Stevens and Mel Ferrer would complain about how race relations were presented in the movie.\n\nRalph Burton (Bellafonte) was stuck in a mine when the world ended, a fact that he learns when he digs himself out of being trapped. Living in a building alone with mannequins, he soon meets Sarah Crandall (Stevens), who has been observing him for some time. She starts to fall in love with him, but even if they’re the last two people alive, he can’t break the bones of segregation.\n\nThey soon nurse Benson Thacker (Ferrer) back to health after finding him and he falls for Sarah. Ralph tries to leave them to be a couple but can’t find it in himself to leave the city. Benson believes that with Ralph alive, he can never be with Sarah, so they go to war with one another, a ridiculous thing when everyone else is dead, killed by a radioactive cloud. Sarah makes them walk hand in hand down the street as the movie comes to an end, closing on a platonic friendship between races rather than showing either violence or romance between each of them."
