        "text": "The World, The Flesh and the Devil by Jack Hay and published by Ritchie Christian Media.\n\nMost of us are not caught up personally in the wars and commotion that sweep the world but, as believers, we are engaged every day in a spiritual warfare. In the main, the enemies arrayed against us are the World, the Flesh and the Devil. ‘Know your enemy’ is a familiar maxim, and this publication is a primer to introduce the reader to some of the Bible’s teaching about these formidable foes. Two of the protagonists are external, but the Flesh is a traitor within, collaborating with the others to incite us to sin, minimise our loyalty to Christ, and impair our service for God.\n\nThere is the constant need for vigilance, for “the evil day” will inevitably come, the day when you are the specific target of the enemy and the battle will rage around you. This little book is sent out with the prayer that, in familiarising yourself with the enemies, and being alerted to the dangers, you will be better equipped to face what is effectively a lifetime of spiritual warfare as “a good soldier of Jesus Christ”."
