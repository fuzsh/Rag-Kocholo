        "text": "This is a provocative three-character story dealing with some pertinent issues (racism, atomic destruction) in a frame of suspense melodrama. Ranald MacDougall, who directed his own screenplay (based on an ancient novel by M.P. Shiel), leaves a few holes in his story, but deliberately.\n\nHarry Belafonte is a coal miner who fights his way out of a wrecked Pennsylvania shaft to find himself apparently alone in a devastated world. After about a third of the film, Inger Stevens turns up, spared because she was in a decompression chamber when the bombs burst. Near the ending, in the last half-hour or so, Mel Ferrer arrives in a small power boat from a fishing expedition.\n\nAlthough overall the film is engrossing, it gets curiously less effective as additional survivors turn up. When Belafonte is entirely alone on the screen for the first one-third of the film, and virtually alone for the first half, the semi-documentary style keeps the film crisp and credible.\n\nPopular on Variety\n\nIt is not clear in the relationship between Belafonte and Stevens whether they are kept apart by her prejudice or his unfounded fear that such an attitude might exist. Ferrer’s character is unsatisfying. He seems to be a racist of sorts, but how virulent isn’t entirely clarified.\n\nMacDougall shot a great deal of the film in Manhattan, and the realism (and the pains taken to achieve it) pay off. New Yorkers might complain that their geography is a little mixed up, but this is of small consequence."
