In keeping with the devilish theme, IFC Films and Shudder are re-releasing the record-breaking feature in theaters through the weekend.\n\nThe version screened will include bonus content featuring a personalized introduction from Fango friend and Devil star David Dastmalchian, followed by an extended Q&A between David and famed cult classic writer/director Kevin Smith.\n\nThe film will play through the weekend on over 500 screens across North America, including theater chains AMC, Cinemark, Drafthousse, Regal, National Amusements, Harkins and Cineplex. Here’s more on Late Night With The Devil:\n\nDirected by Colin and Cameron Cairnes, Late Night With The Devil: follows Jack Delroy, host of a syndicated late night talk show ‘Night Owls’ that has long been a trusted companion to insomniacs around the country. It’s October 31, 1977, a year after the tragic death of Jack’s wife, and ratings have plummeted. Desperate to turn his fortunes around, Jack plans a Halloween special like no other, unaware that he is about to unleash evil into the living rooms of America.\n\nBetween a successful festival run and impressive debut on Shudder, where it is currently streaming, Late Night With The Devil: had a record-breaking theatrical opening weekend back in March, establishing it as IFC’s largest opening weekend of all time.
