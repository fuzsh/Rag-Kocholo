Martin ThorntonWritten byLaurence CowenProduced byCharles UrbanStarringFrank Esmond\n\nStella St. Audrie\n\nWarwick WellingtonDistributed byNatural Color Kinematograph Company\n\nRelease date\n\nRunning time\n\n50 minutesCountryUnited KingdomLanguageEnglish\n\nThe World, the Flesh and the Devil is a 1914 British silent drama film. Now considered a lost film,[citation needed] it was made using the additive color Kinemacolor process.\n\nThe title comes from the Litany in the 1662 Book of Common Prayer: \"From all the deceits of the world, the flesh, and the devil, spare us, good Lord.\"[citation needed]\n\nPlot\n\n[edit]\n\nA very miserable woman hatches a plot to switch the babies of a poor family and a rich family. But the nurse hired to pull off this transfer refuses to go through with it, leaving each baby with its proper family. When the babies are grown, the man from the poor family (who has been led to believe that he did come from the rich family) goes to the house of the other and throws him out. The remainder of the film deals with the frustrations of mistaken identity.\n\nCast\n\n[edit]\n\nFrank Esmond – Nicholas Brophy\n\nStella St. Audrie – Caroline Stanger\n\nWarwick Wellington – Sir James Hall\n\nCharles Carter – Rupert Stanger / Dyke\n\nRupert Harvey – Robert Hall\n\nJack Denton – George Grigg\n\nGladys Cunningham – Mrs. Brophy\n\nFrances Midgeley – Gertrude Grant\n\nMercy Hatton – Lady Hall\n\nH.
