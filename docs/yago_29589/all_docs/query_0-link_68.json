        "text": "Quiz Answer Key and Fun Facts\n\n1. Erica chose to secretly terminate the pregnancy that occurred during her first marriage (in 1973). Who was Erica's first husband and the father of her unborn child?\n\nAnswer: Jeff Martin\n\nIn 1973, Erica Kane (played by Susan Lucci) was young, newly married, and focused on her dream of becoming a famous model. Motherhood was simply not in the planning. Yet, she knew that Jeff would never approve of her decision to have an abortion. When her secret was revealed, Jeff was furious over what she had done. Erica's deception subsequently marked the beginning of the end of her first marriage.\n\n2. Two years after her \"abortion\", Erica became pregnant again. What was the end result of that pregnancy?\n\nAnswer: a devastating miscarriage\n\nErica planned to end her affair with Phil Brent because she believed that his heart would always belong to Tara. She even considered having another abortion. Then Phil found out about the pregnancy, and was thrilled by the news. He even managed to convince Erica that the baby could offer them a lifetime of happiness.\n\nThey got married, purchased a home, and joyfully awaited the birth of their child until their dream was crushed by Erica's miscarriage. She then suffered a nervous breakdown, from which she recovered in a mental hospital.\n\n3. What family planning issue became instrumental in the breakup of Erica's marriage to Tom Cudahy?\n\nAnswer: She took birth control pills without his knowledge or approval.\n\nTom was Erica's third husband. He was also a devout Catholic. Like Erica's previous husbands, Tom was ready to start a family. Erica, who was once again focused on her career, decided to take birth control pills against Tom's wishes. Then once again, her secret surfaced and the marriage dissolved.\n\n4. The birth of Bianca Montgomery was a joyous event for both Erica Kane and Travis Montgomery.\n\nAnswer: True\n\nBy 1988, Erica felt truly ready to become a mother. Both she and her soon-to-be husband, Travis, were thrilled with the arrival of their beautiful little daughter, Bianca.\n\n5. Why was Erica distressed about the reappearance of Kendall Hart in 1993?\n\nAnswer: All of these\n\nIn 1993, the \"All My Children\" writers created a previously unknown storyline about Erica's past. It involved a rape that took place on her fourteenth birthday. The culprit was actor Richard Fields, a friend of her father, Eric Kane. The rape led to the pregnancy that produced Kendall, whom she and Mona gave up for adoption.\n\nAfter years of striving to mentally block out the incident, Erica was suddenly confronted with the child she gave birth to but had never seen. Kendall's presence was now causing her to relive a host of painful memories. To make matters worse, Kendall was devious, demanding, and openly jealous of Erica's beloved daughter, Bianca.\n\n6. Erica never seemed to fully appreciate her own mother until after Mona's passing. What was the cause of Mona's death?\n\nAnswer: She died of lung cancer.\n\nErica was distraught over the death of Mona, whom she never expected to lose so suddenly. Mona passed away quietly in her sleep after a brief battle with lung cancer. Though she was often at odds with her ever-devoted mother, The two shared a deep bond of love.\n\nThe character of Mona Kane Tyler was written out of the \"All My Children\" script shortly after the death of Frances Heflin, who played the role for twenty-four years. Heflin also died of lung cancer.\n\n7. Who were the parents of the baby girl that Erica kidnapped in 1997?\n\nAnswer: Maria and Edmund\n\nErica delivered Maria's premature baby daughter during a storm at Willow Lake. The baby, who was presumed dead, was actually rescued and cared for by a woman named Esther Glynn. Erica later found the child, who she pretended was her adopted Russian daughter, Sonia.\n\nShe believed that Dimitri was the baby's father. Her mistaken belief about the child's paternity gave her reason to rationalize the kidnapping. The child was eventually returned to her parents, Maria and Edmund who named her Madeline Flora Grey.\n\n8. Erica happily awaited the birth of her first grandchild.\n\nAnswer: False\n\nErica was terribly upset when she discovered that Bianca canceled her planned abortion. Miranda (like Kendall) was a child of rape. Bianca's maternal feelings for her unborn child motivated her to give birth to Miranda. Many complications ensued during the first few months following the birth.\n\nA baby switching scam deprived the grieving Bianca of her child who was presumed dead. Kendall served as a constant source of comfort and support for Bianca during Erica's absence. In the long run, the \"Kane women\" emerged from the crisis stronger and more bonded than ever before. Also, Erica soon grew to love her precious little granddaughter.\n\n9. When Erica married Jackson Montgomery in 2005, she acquired three stepchildren. Who was not among this group?\n\nAnswer: Miranda\n\nJackson adopted Lily during his marriage to her late mother, Laurel Banning. Reggie was a lonely teenager whom Jack befriended then adopted. Greenlee was an adult when she and Jack discovered that he was her biological father. Ryan was married to Greenlee when Erica married Jack.\n\n10. In 2006, Erica shockingly learned that she was the biological mother of Josh Madden.\n\nAnswer: True\n\nIn 2006, Erica found out that the child she believed to have aborted more than three decades earlier was actually alive and well. In a science fiction-like scenario, Dr. Greg Madden who performed the procedure managed to spare the life of the fetus, to be implanted in the womb of his (now late) wife who eventually gave birth to a baby boy. Josh, the \"son\" of Dr. and Mrs. Madden is actually the biological son of Erica Kane and Dr. Jeff Martin. Back in 1973 \"All My Children\" made history when presenting television's first legal abortion storyline.\n\nSource: Author memorylane42\n\nThis quiz was reviewed by FunTrivia editor ladymacb29 before going online.\n\nAny errors found in FunTrivia content are routinely corrected through our feedback system."
