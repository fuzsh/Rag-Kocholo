        "text": "Yeah, I remember that apartment. They had her living there for most of the 80s, except when she was married to Adam. There was an excitment there, with the atmospheric NY lifestyle, which included Nexus and Kirbys, juxtaposed with the \"Our Town\" feeling of the storylines taking place in PV. It was a very interesting story dynamic, and I think the isolation made sense for the character, in a way, but ultimately it also drastically limited who she interacted with on a regular basis. For the early-mid 80s, it was mostly Mark, Mona, Olga, and whatever men was in her life. Of course there was her interaction with Palmer during the Lars Nazi stuff."
