        "text": "TV producer Helmut Huber passed away at 84 years old on March 28, 2022.\n\nHuber was married to the All My Children soap actress Susan Lucci and is survived by their four children, his brother, eight grandchildren, and two great-grandchildren.\n\nWho was Helmut Huber?\n\nHelmut Huber was born in Austria in 1937 and became a US citizen in January 1994.\n\nHe led a career in entertainment, operating as Susan's manager and as the CEO of Pine Valley Productions.\n\nAs a young man, Huber was asked to join the Austrian Ski Team but instead chose to follow an apprenticeship at the Hotel Maria Theresia.\n\nHe later graduated at the top of his class at L'Ecole Hoteliere in Lausanne, Switzerland.\n\nA family representative said in a statement that Huber was “A family man, he was a loyal friend and loved them deeply.\n\n“With a roaring sense of humor, larger-than-life personality, and a practical problem-solver, he lived his life to the fullest.”\n\nThe statement concluded, “Mr. Huber, who formerly raced motorcycles in Austria, was a first-rate skier, and avid golfer, belonging to the Garden City Golf Club and Westhampton Country Club.\"\n\nHow did Helmut Huber die?\n\nHuber passed away peacefully at his Long Island home in New York.\n\nHis family has asked that instead of flowers, contributions be made to the American Stroke Association in support of stroke awareness and research.\n\nLucci's publicist released a statement saying, \"Helmut's passing is a tremendous loss for all who knew and loved him. He was an extraordinary husband, father, grandfather, and friend.\n\n\"The family kindly asks for privacy during this incredibly difficult time.\"\n\nWhen did Helmut Huber and Susan Lucci meet?\n\nHelmut Huber and Susan Lucci met in the summer of 1965 in Long Island, New York.\n\nLucci was 18 years old and had just finished her freshman year at Marymount College and had just started a waitressing job at the Garden City Hotel when she met Huber.\n\nHe was working at the restaurant as a chef and head of food and beverage service, and in an interview with People in June 1999, he said it was love at first sight.\n\n\"The first time I saw Susie, it hit me,\" he said. \"Still today, she walks in a room, and I just light up.\"\n\nLucci didn't see Huber as a romantic prospect at the time, as he was nine years her senior, and in 1968 she got engaged to another man.\n\nBut when she held her engagement party at the hotel where she once worked, she ran into Huber and her mother invited him to the party.\n\nIn the 1999 interview with People, Lucci said Huber had told her mother that her engagement wouldn't last.\n\n\"Helmut leaned over to my mother and said, 'This thing between Susie and this boy is never going to last,'\" Lucci said.\n\n\"I heard about that much later. And my mother agreed with him, but she didn’t tell me that.\"\n\nLucci broke off her engagement a few months after the party and she and Huber started dating.\n\nThey dated for several months and after Huber proposed numerous times, Lucci finally said yes.\n\nThey got married in September 1968 and Lucci scored the role of Erica Kane on All My Children around the same time.\n\n\"He always made me laugh and he still does,\" Lucci told Closer Weekly in a 2019 interview.\n\n“Helmut doesn’t look like somebody who would make you laugh. He looks very imposing, but then he’s very funny. The combination is great.\""
