        "text": "The drama on All My Children takes place in the fictional town of Pine Valley, Pennsylvania which is supposedly a suburb of Philadelphia.\n\nAll of the episodes of All My Children were recorded from the very beginning but, unfortunately, the early ones on film were tossed out! The ones that were videotaped are luckily stored away for posterity.\n\nAs of 2010, Susan Lucci (Erica Kane) and Ray MacDonnell (Joe Martin) were the only two original Cast on All My Children who remain on the show. Ray then retired in 2010 leaving Susan as the sole remaining member of the cast.\n\nA couple of years before the series expanded to 60 minute long episodes ABC tried the hour long format for one week beginning on June 30, 1975.\n\nIn the opening credits there are some words show that apparently were written in the photo album. They are: \"The great and the least, The rich and the poor, The weak and the strong, In sickness and in health, In joy and sorrow, In tragedy and triumph, You are All My Children.\n\nEven if you aren't a fan of All My Children or soap operas in general, you may have heard of some of those who appeared on the show. Among them are Kim Delaney (\"NYPD Blue\"), Sarah Michelle Gellar (\"Buffy the Vampire Slayer\"), Stacy Haiduk (\"SeaQuest DSV\"), Lee Meriwether (\"Barnaby Jones\") and Mario Van Peebles (\"Damages\").\n\nABC began broadcasting All My Children in high definition on February 3, 2010!\n\nOne atypical statistic for the series is that in the mid 1970s, the male viewers comprised 30% of the total audience! Due to the fact that many viewers are at work when the show airs, it is one of the most recorded series on television.\n\nAll My Children also made soap opera history in 1978 when it became the first American soap to shoot abroad for Tom and Erica's honeymoon on Saint Croix."
