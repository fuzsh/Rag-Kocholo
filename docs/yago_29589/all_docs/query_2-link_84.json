        "text": "Lenas the new doorman.\n\nThe Set-Up  Everywhere, its still Thanksgiving. My fridge weeps in sympathy.\n\nAt the Martins, Ruth forgets to stuff Opals mouth.\n\nAt the Pine Valley Inn, Mary gives Erica one more reason not to eat and is then appalled by Kendall. I know, I know: there by the grace of god.\n\nMaggie stuffs Reggies mouth with bread, then waits for leftovers.\n\nThe Hospital  Bad news everyone: Carlos is awake and hes talking.\n\nPVI Dining Room  Mary is certain that Erica and Kendall can work things out because, after all, she and her daughter have made \"incredible progress\" and \"gotten so close\" since Greenlee slipped her that hundred bucks.\n\nMyrtles common sense is drowned out by Ericas protests that, even though she hasnt asked her, she knows perfectly well what it is that Bianca wants  and thats to play musical chairs with Kendall and wave her hands really fast in front of everyone in hope theyll be so confused that theyll just ignore her.\n\nBianca leaves the table and Lena follows her after stopping Kendall; Maggie follows, too, because, somewhere in the distance, she heard a high-pitch sound and, well, shes the obedient sort.\n\nJacks just mad cause he wanted to have a nice Thanksgiving and, instead, hes stuck with the family from hell.\n\nOh, come on Jack: my first American Thanksgiving was just like yours! There were people so drunk they couldnt talk and there were mutterings of affairs and of relatives afflicted with incurable diseases and, when we finally got to the pie, my girlfriend and I were asked about our sex life. See, youre actually way ahead of me there, buddy. Now, be quiet and put on your apron.\n\nThe Search Warrants Interlude  A set of three police officers, each accompanied by Derek, search Kendalls condo; they then move on to Jacks pad, Myrtles boarding house, Davids Cow Sanctuary and Ericas closets.\n\nAll on the same day: is Derek the new Santa?\n\nPVI Dining Room  Erica needs gods strength to sit at the table with Kendall: I need it to survive the grotesque macking that follows.\n\nMyrtle is tapped to say grace and demands that everyone hold hands. Bianca and Lena do, too, because its safe when gods in the middle. Erica and Mary just hold a napkin.\n\nIn what I think is supposed to be a moment of conjecture, Maggie twists her face when she hears Lena suggesting sparkling cider for both herself and Bianca, but since all the squirrels I know move the same way, I decide she just swallowed a nut whole.\n\nFrankenBrow stops by with a gift and demands that Kendall submit to a DNA test to establish VolderFakes paternity. Bianca finishes Maggies nuts.\n\nThe Martins  Jamie toasts to Babe and the 6-week old BabyBoob. No, wait: 9-week old BabyBoob. No, wait: 10-week old BabyBoob.\n\nJ.R.: \"Its not like a few weeks makes that big of a difference.\"\n\nIf I gave a damn, Id have a come back for that line: as it is, I succumb to a turkey-induced coma.\n\nPVI Dining Room  In the vain hope that her peripheral vision will fail and shell miss the David and Erica tongue swap, Mary sticks a straw into her glass of wine and doesnt stop sucking.\n\nDavid accuses Jack of having planted drugs in Michaels apartment, but its everyone else who looks guilty, even my girlfriend Myrtle. Lena just wishes she were back in Poland and not listening to her girlfriends mothers drunken confession of sex \"with the man with the hair.\"\n\nWhat? Oh, right: that was my Thanksgiving thirteen years ago. As you can see, I wasnt scarred by the experience at all.\n\nKendall joins Bianca in the restroom where the magic water doesnt smudge the make up. Bianca convinces herself - again - that it is all worth it in the name of VolderGrapefruit: Kendall will be shunned an hated forever? That's ok: at least the baby will be safe!\n\nSniff. It's all so beautiful.\n\nOn her way out, Kendall chats up the citrus and manages to make it a HoYay triangle.\n\nOn her way in, Maggie slams the door and demands to know why Bianca told Lena about the pregnancy.\n\nWhat, are you angry that Bianca chose to tell Lena while you found out because you happened to be around? Aww. Open your mouth and let me see if I can throw a piece of turkey in. Ive deboned it, I promise.\n\nMaggie: \"What makes you think that you can actually trust her?\"\n\nBianca: \"Maggie, where is this coming from?\"\n\nFrom her side of the triangle, but I dont think anyones told her that triangles have three sides, not one.\n\nBianca: \"Maggie, you dont know Lena the way I do.\"\n\nHeh. Oh, wait: thats so inappropriate of me. Ill just go have a piece of pie while Bianca looks on condescendingly.\n\nMaggie: \"Shes always out for herself: I dont trust her.\"\n\nLena: \"I dont blame you, but Bianca knows that I wont betray her and you can trust that, too, Maggie.\"\n\nShe might after she runs that through the English to Woof translator.\n\nThe Last Scenes  At the hospital, Rick is the best nurse ever  but he also wears a ring on his pinkie and that means hell liberate us all from Borearlos: thank god for the Argentinean mob.\n\nAt the Martins, Jamie refuses J.R.s toast and kicks dirt in the air.\n\nAt the PVI Dining Room, Marys errant hand finds Davids thigh.\n\nTOMORROW ON ALL MY CHILDREN: Ryan wants to have a talk with Bianca; Adam thinks J.R. should know he married \"a slut;\" J.R. thinks Jamie wants Babe; Jack is removed from the Cambias case.\n\nCOMMENTARIES\n\nMystic:\n\n[I] wonder how things are gonna be with Lianca if we ever do get them. The one thing I always found odd but interesting about Lianca is that Lena brings out more of Bianca's insecurities than anyone else has (like thinking Lena was dumping her after their 'spectacular' night, thinking Lena won't love her if she's different post V., the baby, ect.). That really struck me when compared to Binky's other relationships where Bianca always put herself out there totally for the other person. With Lena, she holds back more than she has in the past. I guess all of her other relationships/crushes imploding or never getting off the ground finally jaded her some. That's a nice contrast to Lena who acts just like how Binky used to act, totally out there for the taking. I'm thinking a lot of Binky's trust issues (and I do believe she has some) with Lena has nothing to do with Lena's past or her lying, but everything to do with Bianca thinking that it's all going to blow up in her face. After all, every other relationship she's had, has. Add to that, nothing in Bianca's life has been going too well lately. I wonder if Lena's optimism and open-ness can trump Bianca's newfound defeatist outlook? I hope to find out. I do love this complicated mess of a non-couple.\n\nSolvay:\n\nLeave it to [McTavish]. Why write a \"jealous friend SL [storyline] with a number of subtle nuances\" when you can write an \"over-the-top jealous stalker\" SL? I thought Maggie's reaction today was quite a bit stronger than the stage had been set for. My gut reaction was that McTrash was preserving the option to go the \"crazed murderous jealous Single White Female\" route. She wrote Michael to change him from the evil slimy business character into the evil sicko rapist. Today it felt like she was setting the stage / preserving the option to go a similar route with Maggie. If I didn't know how much she likes Liz (and seems to somewhat cater to Bam) I would be worried that she might actually do it.\n\nTalk about whiplash though. Liz must open every script wondering if it's a support Lena week or a slam Lena week. Maggie crossed a line today. She's never been so openly snarky to Lena (\"we'll just have to see, won't we\") or so openly harsh with Bianca. \"What makes you think you can actually trust her?\" was delivered with such venom that I thought at first she was going to say \"what makes you think it was okay with me to tell her?\". Maggs slammed the bathroom door so hard I think I saw the wall shake in the mirror. I was glad that Bianca snapped back with her \"a few months ago you said\" line. I would have liked to see the scene continue but Lena diffused the situation quickly and Maggie is too passive / aggressive to do more than make a snide remark and leave. I wish Bianca had looked at Lena while being led out the door. If their eyes had met even for a second it would have conveyed a lot about Bianca's focus shifting to Lena. Today's scene and Bianca's general disregard for Maggie make me nervous about the lengths Maggie will go to to get noticed as she realizes she is losing out to both Kendall and Lena. Guess those spoilers about Maggie playing a hand in the Lianca reunion were false. (Or we'll be subjected to the yo-yo that is McTrash's writing style and find that Maggie has recognized true love and decided to bring Lena and Bianca together. Ugh.)\n\nBlack Knight wrote:\n\nI agree she still thinks of them as a couple, even if they're not technically together--after all, she can see that Lena's still wearing that commitment ring. Lena told her at the time that she would wear that ring as a sign of her love and keep Bianca's own ring until Bianca was ready to wear it herself, so seeing Lena still wearing that ring is enough indication for Bianca that they're a de facto couple even if they're not technically together.\n\nITA. Bianca absolutely still thinks of herself and Lena as a couple. Her concern about telling Lena about the baby earlier was centered on her belief that Lena didn't want kids crossed with her hope that things would work out for her and Lena. It wouldn't matter if Lena wanted kids or not if Bianca didn't want to be with her. But the conversation between Binks and Lena in Maggie's dorm room was about Bianca testing whether her child would have 2 mommies. Her disappointment afterward seemed focused on her belief that it wasn't going to work as hoped. Her \"so you would have supported my keeping my baby\" question to Lena in her apartment was the corollary that will allow the relationship to resume in reality. And for the most part Bianca's family perpetuate that \"still a couple\" scenario. Erica's sudden Lena-love and Kendall's efforts to help Lena have all been because of concern for Bianca.\n\nBlack Knight wrote:\n\nShe was always amazed that Lena chose her. And while Lena understands Bianca very well in many ways, I think this is the thing she understands least about Bianca.\n\nI think Lena has total light blocking blinders on when it comes to the above. She has no idea. She has been trying to atone for the sins of her past for so long it hasn't yet occured to her that she might be viewed as desirable for her own true self. Realizing that Bianca feels amazed to have been chosen by her would require more self-esteem than she has had (until recently). The off-shoot of Lena's suicide attempt and Michael's death seems to be that Lena finally feels free to pursue a course that is good for her. Hence her self-esteem seems to be growing. Now she may finally be in a place to realize Bianca's amazement.\n\nBlack Knight:\n\nThe look on Bianca's face when Maggie was dragging her out was cracking me up. You know how Olga does all those fabulous I'm-screwed expressions? Well, Eden's got an equally impressive repertoire of WTF? looks. First Bianca was surprised that Lena seemed to think that Maggie was the one for her. Now she's surprised by the other side of it. She's paid very little attention to what's going on with Maggie, what with everything else she has on her plate, and she looked less than thrilled to realize she's got another problem to deal with. I doubt there'll be a triangle, at least not a true triangle. Bianca is simply not interested in Maggie. Honestly, I don't think she ever really was. She didn't give a flip when Tim was interested in Maggie; in fact, she encouraged the relationship. It was Maggie who got annoyed and kept insisting on her preference for Bianca's company over Tim's. I think at that point Bianca, since she hadn't dated in eons and was still a little susceptible to the Frankie-lookalike factor, sort of went along with it. Maggie was there and available and seemed interested. When she finally told Bianca that she wasn't really interested, Bianca got over it in about two minutes flat.\n\nToday's episode was as good as I was hoping. The Kane/Montgomery fiasco had me laughing within the first twenty seconds. The Mary/Erica bits in particular were hysterical, from Mary lecturing Erica on mother/daughter relationships to the two holding a napkin as their compromise for saying grace. And God bless Anna Stuart for trying to glom onto Boyd. I've always wanted to see a Mary/Boyd pairing. And I also liked when David finally brought up the elephant at the table, Michael's murder, and they started cutting to shots of all the suspects. Just as I was thinking, \"This is so Clue,\" Jack made a Clue reference. Bwah. This is what I really enjoyed when the Cambias murder SL first started, until AMC lost steam by dragging it out too much. But today was back to classic form, and fun fun fun. I don't think I've had this much fun watching a dysfunctional soap family celebrate a holiday since the classic Quartermaine gatherings of years past. I realized that's what the Kane family has been lacking all along--enough members to really cause some big fights. With the addition of Greenlee, Reggie, and Mary, not to mention assorted significant others, that's no longer an issue.\n\nSaphyre:\n\nAs for Maggie- let's consider the character (what little we know of at this point). She had a very unhappy childhood. She does have family now (David) but Anna left (who Maggie was very close to) and that's her only real family. She doesn't have much of a life (that we've seen) outside of school. Bianca is the first person she really felt close to in her life, and she has recently been helping Bianca go through the toughest thing she (Bianca) has had to deal with in her life. She (Maggie) has been the rock for Bianca for the past several months, supporting her when Bianca didn't trust anyone else... accepting the choices Bianca made even if she didn't agree with them... moving in with her to take the heat off Bianca (from Erica) planning to leave school and go away with Bianca so she's not alone. Her feelings for Bianca, at mildest, are those of a very close very best friend. At the deepest, she has romantic feelings for Bianca that she is not yet aware of. Either way, she does love Bianca. Maggie and Bianca have been each other's whole lives for a while now. All of a sudden, Bianca is feeling better, \"coming out\" into her life again. Maggie's reaction to Kendell knowing about the baby was mild frustration. She wasn't happy with Kendell's \"interference\" in her relationship with Bianca. Now Lena is another person involved. Now Maggie's not the only one to know, to support Bianca. Maggie's raison-d'etre (so to speak) is dissolving. And everybody here says \"ah, she's such a crazy bitch!\" ???WTF??? People are so willing to believe that Lena could do all the crazy things she's done out of love for Bianca... why can't people understand Maggie's crazy behavior out of HER love (platonic or otherwise) for Bianca?\n\nBlack Knight:\n\nWell, I do get why Maggie's attached herself to Bianca--given her childhood and so on, Bianca and David have been the closest things Maggie's had to stability, ever. So it's understandable, but when Magit comes down to it, she still has no life outside of her best friend and she desperately needs to get one. Bianca doesn't look or act remotely interested, Eden doesn't inject the HoYay in the scenes that she used to. And while I agree that she's been playing Bianca as a traumatized rape victim the last few months who's not interested in anyone, she's also gradually started playing slow sexual awakening. That was first noticeable in the dorm room scenes when she and Lena were looking at the aquarium and noticed how close they were to each other--very reminiscent of the sexual tension moment when they were moving Boyd's boxes into Myrtle's place. Bianca still isn't ready for sex, I think partly because of the conversation with Lena that it would entail that she isn't ready to have, but she's not dead from the neck down anymore, either. And Bianca just looks quite in love with Lena in all their recent scenes, and asks Lena to spend time with her. Maggie she barely glances at, and when she does half the time it's to tell Maggie to go away.\n\nAnd I don't think it's so much that Bianca still sees herself and Lena as a couple, I think Bianca just doesn't think she has any other options.\n\nWhile Bianca may not see Maggie or anyone else as an option, I don't think at this point in her life she's interested in a relationship for the sake of a relationship. She doesn't need a girlfriend. And wanting a girlfriend has been largely diminished by the rape--she hasn't been interested in sex for a while, and she's not that interested in sex now, she has plenty of love and support from family and friends, and she has so much on her plate to deal with. I really do think that if she wants to be with Lena, it's because she wants to be with Lena, not because she wants a girlfriend for the sake of having a girlfriend. Now, a year ago, I think that was the attraction where Maggie was concerned--Maggie seemed interested and Bianca didn't think she had any other options. She didn't start to consider Maggie until Maggie started sending her all those signals, and then figured it'd be silly to turn down the opportunity, since she had no other women come calling. And, of course, Lena's hardly chopped liver--she's a gorgeous, elegant, sophisticated, intelligent woman. I don't think Bianca's ever thought she was \"settling\" for the HPF\n\nSaphyre:\n\nI certainly don't mean to imply that Bianca is \"settling\" for Lena. Lena is a very classy gorgeous woman. I do think it sucks how she came to town as this corporate shark and betrayed Bianca (but then, don't they all? this is a soap after all) yet nobody screams about how Lena \"hurt\" Bianca. It's so easy to see ONLY this newly remade Lena who is so in love with Bianca and would do no wrong. I like Lena, please understand that. But I like Maggie too. I just think that Bianca and Lena didn't have a chance to really fall in love or have a relationship before the rape. They had all of what, two episodes (some sarcasm here) between Lena betraying Bianca and then Bianca being raped. I think Lena loves Bianca because it's the only love she's ever known (and here I mean love in the romantic sense, because we know Lena's mom loves her) but I think Bianca is in love with the idea of being in love. She may like Lena, she may be attracted to her, but I don't think they've had time to know each other enough to be in love.\n\nI think Bianca and Lena have unfinished business together no matter what the outcome of any of this is. They were all set to \"begin anew\" the day Bianca was raped. They need to revisit that and decide if they can have a relationship or not. But my point is that now, as Bianca realizes she's not \"dead from the waist down\" (I like that *lol*) she will first and only consider Lena, because 1) they have unfinished business and 2) Lena is the only option (again, this is not meant to discredit Lena in any way)\n\nI do feel that IF Maggie has romantic/sexual feelings for Bianca and IF she lets Bianca know about them, we may see Bianca have some questions of her own, despite her feelings for Lena. Bianca and Maggie have a history- I think Bianca liked Maggie first because she reminded her of Frankie, but Binx and Maggie got very close, they had a lot of close, intimate moments together... and Bianca was very dissapointed when Maggie was not interested/not ready to have a \"relationship\" with Bianca. All I'm saying is that at least at one point Bianca had very real feelings for Maggie, and if Bianca finds out that Maggie IS interested in her that way- Bianca's feelings won't be as cut and dry as a lot of people might want them to be.\n\nPARODY\n\nThis parody is by LizzieT.\n\nThanksgiving festivities continued in Pine Valley.\n\nOver at the hospital.....\n\nMaria: We have so much to be thankful for this year.\n\nEdmund: Yes we do. For instance, Carlos is getting better.\n\nMaria: Yes. I know the audience would much rather see us here with Carlos, Juan Pablo and Simone than at Wildwind having a touching family Thanksgiving with our children. Where are they anyway?\n\nEdmund: People kept complaining that we were favoring Maddie too much so I locked her in the attic with Sam.\n\nMaria: You're such a good father. It's important to treat all the children in the family equally.\n\nCarlos: Simone, I'm glad you're here with me but wouldn't you rather be with Tad?\n\nSimone: Tad and I aren't serious. They're waiting to see what his chemistry is like with the new character before they make any committment to our relationship. Here, have some soup.\n\nCarlos: What is this stuff? I don't think I've ever eaten anything this shade of green before.\n\nSimone: You're being written off soon. You didn't think they'd waste actual turkey on you did you?\n\nJuan Pablo: I am confused. I am supposed to leave Pine Valley with my brother but I have not heard that I am being written out. In my country one's future is not so up in the air. Will I still be a part of Pine Valley when Carlos is gone or is my time here nearly over?\n\nEdmund: Don't sweat it. Even if you're still on contract you might be invisible. It happens to all of us.\n\nSimone: Speaking of back burner, who made all this delicious food?\n\nEdmund: Isabella.\n\nSimone: Do you think she'd adopt me?\n\nEdmund: Maybe. How good is your slap reflex?\n\nSearch warrants were executed around town.\n\nDerek: Here we are at Kendall's condo. Did you find anything?\n\nCop: Not really. Just a book called \"Faking Pregnancy for Dummies\".\n\nDerek: Here we are at Erica's. Did you find anything?\n\nCop: Not really. She does have the most extensive collection of wedding dresses outside of the Smithsonian but no real evidence.\n\nDerek: Here we are at David's. Did you find anything?\n\nCop: Not really. Just a few leftover vials of Libidizone and Dixie's sweater.\n\nDerek: Here we are at Myrtle's. Did you find anything?\n\nCop: Not really. Just some lemonade in the refrigerator. Here, have some:::hic::::\n\nDerek: All right. I think I'm ready to make an arrest now. But first, let's finish off the lemonade. This stuff is good.:::hic::::\n\nOver at the Martin's.....\n\nAdam: How dare you show up to question me on Thanksgiving?\n\nCop: I thought this was Monday.\n\nAdam: In the real world yes. In Pine Valley it's Thanksgiving.\n\nRuth: I thought last Tuesday was Thanksgiving.\n\nJoe: It was. So was Wednesday.\n\nPalmer: I think tomorrow most likely will be Thanksgiving too.\n\nBrooke: Actually it may be Thanksgiving right up until Christmas.\n\nJustin: I love Christmas. I hope Santa brings me a pony this year.\n\nCop: Justin!\n\nJustin: Sorry. Mr. Chandler, we have to question you now.\n\nOpal: Pardon me while I forget that I used to be a homespun character with a lot of common sense::::pause::::Oh no! I hope they don't know anything about what my lovebug Palmer was up to the night Michael was killed. If they do he'll be in more trouble than a bobcat with a mouth full of tail feathers caught by a farmer with a shotgun.\n\nCop: What's she talking about?\n\nTad: Nothing. We'll just do some schtick to make her look insane.\n\nCop: Oh, I see. Comic relief?\n\nTad: Or something.\n\nJustin: All right Mr. Chandler. I still have to question you. Do you think Santa really watches us all the time to see if we're naughty or nice? Cause I've been naughty a few times but not that much.\n\nCop: Justin!\n\nJustin: OK. Where were you the night Michael was murdered.\n\nAdam: I was with Stuart.\n\nStuart: That's right. He was.....except for the time he was gone long enough to fly back to Pine Valley, kill someone, hide the body in a meat locker, and fly back.\n\nAdam: Telling the truth is something you believe in strongly isn't it Stuart?\n\nStuart: Yes. Besides, I'm tired of you hogging all the screentime. Maybe if you get arrested I'll get my own storyline instead of just being your conscience.\n\nJR: I'd like to propose a toast. To my mother Dixie. She may have gone on to a better place but her spirit is still here.\n\nRuth: Yes, to Dixie. I\"ve heard such lovely things about Oakdale.\n\nJR: And to my wife Babe who is 6 weeks pregnant.\n\nJamie::::clunk::::::\n\nTad::::clunk::::\n\nBrooke::::clunk::::\n\nAdam: ::::Bwahahahahahahahaha:::::::\n\nBabe: He means 10 weeks. 6 weeks would mean I could have gotten pregnant in some one night stand when I first hit town and that didn't happen.\n\nJR: 6, 10, what difference does it make? It could even be 2 weeks.\n\nPalmer:::::clunk::::\n\nJoe::::clunk:::::\n\nCable guy:::::clunk::::::\n\nAdam: ::::Bwahahahahahahahahahahaha:::::"
