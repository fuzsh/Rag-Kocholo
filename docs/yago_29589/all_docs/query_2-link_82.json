        "text": "General Hospital spoilers for July 17, 2023, reveal sneaky investigations, a sad little boy, big confessions, and so much more.\n\nGeneral Hospital Spoilers Highlights\n\nLucy (Lynn Herring) made her date at a new Pine Valley haunt with Jackson Montgomery (Walt Willey) and is all about turning on the charm. However, she still loves her Marty (Michael E. Knight). She just wants to get to the bottom of why he is getting a $50K deposit from Pine Valley every month and thinks Jackson has the answer.\n\nWhile Lucy is wined and dined by Jack, Felicia (Kristina Wagner) sneaks back into his office now that she knows where the filing cabinet key is. However, Jackson has never been a dummy and still isn’t. After all, he was married to Erica Kane (Susan Lucci), and if Erica is your wife, you need to be on your game. To that end, Jackson knows Lucy is up to something fishy and enjoys letting her hang herself.\n\nGeneral Hospital: Neddie Causes Complications\n\nNeddie (Wally Kurth) still feels alone in life and just wants to pick up a guitar and sing while hitting the road. However, his family is still a wreck, including his kids. Chase (Josh Swickard) just wants to help Brook Lynn (Amanda Setton) so he tracks down Neddie. Will he try to talk to him and see if he’ll come around and treat the Qs better?\n\nREAD THIS: Find out what happened today on General Hospital.\n\nAs for poor little Leo (Easton Rocket Sweda), he is feeling lost and confused without his dad and doesn’t know why he doesn’t want to see him anymore. Olivia (Lisa LoCicero) is alarmed when Leo acts out. Will Tracy (Jane Elliot), who has a way with kids and seems to have a special affinity for Leo, be able to get through to him?\n\nGH Spoilers: Ava Makes A Confession\n\nGH spoilers say that Ava (Maura West) is ready to fess up. Does she finally tell someone else what happened to Nikolas and the mess she is in? Sonny (Maurice Benard) would be a good person to start with because we are sure he would help her. Or does this have anything to do with her feelings for Austin (Roger Howarth)?\n\nAs for Austin, he relays a message. Is it another threat for Ava from his cousin Mason (Nathanyael Grey)? Does she need to find information on Sonny and the Pikeman Group before it’s too late?\n\nIn case you missed it, mornings on Soap Hub are for commentary or wild speculation about General Hospital’s current stories — where they’re going, how they’re doing, and sometimes just what we’re hoping we will see in the near future in Port Charles. We’re particularly fond of this one, so please click here to read it."
