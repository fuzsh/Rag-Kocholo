        "text": "All of America stood and cheered when Susan Lucci won the Emmy Award for Outstanding Lead Actress in a Drama Series in May of 1999. It was a historic moment not only for Susan Lucci, but for all of television. Audiences have been held spellbound by the sexy, sassy, beautiful \"woman you love to hate\" - Erica Kane. TV Guide calls her \"unequivocally the most famous soap opera character in the history of daytime TV.\" Soap Opera Digest says her \"character is larger than life.\" Susan Lucci, the actress who has made scheming temptress a household name, claims, \"Erica is probably the best part ever written for a woman.\"\n\nMiss Lucci has seen Erica grow from troubled teen to international beauty, progressing over the years from high-fashion model to philanthropist to magazine publisher. She's had nine marriages to six different men - Erica Kane Martin Brent Cudahy Chandler Montgomery Montgomery Chandler Marick Marick. She's been kidnapped, survived a plane crash, stared down a grizzly bear, posed as a nun, driven a race car and attempted a daring helicopter rescue of one of her lovers from prison. But she always rises, phoenix-like, from her own ashes.\n\nWith the 1999 Emmy Award for Outstanding Actress in addition to countless other awards  such as a 1992 People's Choice Award, the 1993 Soap Opera Digest Award for Outstanding Lead Actress, the 1994 Crystal Apple Award, the 1985 People magazine poll as Best Soap Actress, the 1988 Soap Opera Digest Editor's Award for Outstanding Contribution to Daytime Television, the 1989 Canadian TV Guide People's Choice Award for Best Soap Actress, the Italian-American Welfare League's \"Woman of the Year,\" as well as 19 Emmy nominations for \"Outstanding Actress\"  it is understandable that Susan Lucci as Erica Kane is as popular as the show itself. Soap Opera Digest has chosen Susan Lucci as the most beautiful woman on television many times and selected her as \"Woman of the Year\" in August of 1999. Further adding to this impressive resume, Ms. Lucci was one of a select group of individuals (including General Norman Schwarzkopf) to be honored with a prestigious American Academy of Achievement Award in June of 1991, and in April of 2000 Susan became the newest living legend to have her caricature immortalized on the walls of the famous restaurant, Sardi's. Susan was also honored by the Film Society of Lincoln Center at the 38th Annual New York Film Festival and is listed in the \"Who's Who in America\" directory.\n\nIf there's one thing Susan and Erica have in common, it's their dedication to pursuing a career. In addition to her leading role on All My Children, in the 1997-98 season, Susan starred in the movie for television, Blood on Her Hands, as Isabelle Collins, a woman no man could resist. In the 1994-95 season, Susan starred in the movie for television, Seduced and Betrayed; and in the humorous remake of Scrooge, Ebbie.\n\nDuring the 1993-94 season, she starred in the primetime television film, French Silk, for ABC; Between Love and Hate, also for ABC, in the 1992-93 season; during 1991-92, she starred in ABC's The Woman Who Sinned; and in Double Edge. Before that, she starred in the final season of the primetime serial, Dallas; hosted Saturday Night Live, and starred in the ABC television film, The Bride in Black, which was the highest-rated movie on ABC during the 1990-91 season. She also appeared in a critically acclaimed humorous television commercial for the sugar substitute, Sweet One; a television spot for Wendy's, and has done a series of commercials for Ford.\n\nMs. Lucci's other made-for-television movies include Lady Mobster, Mafia Princess, Invitation to Hell, Anastasia and Haunted By Her Past.\n\nThe versatile actress also served as co-host with Tony Danza on the ABC Television Network special, 99 Ways to Attract the Right Man, and appeared in the primetime television extravaganzas, Night of 100 Stars II and III. She also appeared in the feature film, Young Doctors in Love. Outside of acting, Susan is also well-rounded in her interests and activities, which include tennis, skiing and traveling.\n\nDuring the 1999 holiday season, Susan Lucci made her Broadway debut as Annie Oakley in Annie Get Your Gun, receiving standing ovations at every performance. On May 18, 2001 Susan graced the stage in her first Nightclub performance opening for Regis Philbin in Atlantic City. Within the 2001/2002 season, Susan's sensational Nightclub performance dazzled audiences as she graced the stage to sold out performances opening for Regis Philbin in Atlantic City and Foxwoods. In October, Susan worked with musical director John McDaniel and Shawn Gough and opened the season at Feinstein's at the Regency as she debuted her cabaret act. Rex Reed stated, \"this is a gal that sends you home smiling.\" This June, she opened at Theaterfest at Montclair State University in New Jersey for a three-day concert series.\n\nThough Ms. Lucci has proven to be a phenomenal actress, both on camera and on stage, it is only one of Ms. Lucci's many passions. In 1991, she launched the Susan Lucci Collection of hair care products. Recently, she has created a sensual fragrance, Susan Lucci Invitation and a new, fresh, sparkling fragrance, LaLucci. Both fragrances were finalist for a Fifi Award. The year of 2001 brought great inspiration and success for Susan as she proudly introduced her own jewelry, shoes and accessory line  all inspired by her personal experience as an actress, wife and mother. This spring, Susan will launch her clothing line. Susan's head-to-toe collection is available on the Home Shopping Network (HSN).\n\nSusan's website, susanlucci.com, features her products along with her Susan Lucci doll, a photo gallery, and an online chat room. Ms. Lucci has worked diligently to develop a website that serves as a successful business as well as an opportunity for her to get to know her fans. The website has received highest recognition by Yahoo! for superlative quality and excellent customer service.\n\nSusan always makes sure to find time for what she believes to be most important, children. She works tirelessly to support Little Flowers Children's Services of New York, the largest child care agency in New York State providing foster care and adoption services to all five boroughs as well as Long Island. She has also served as the March of Dimes' National Ambassador in 2000 and as a celebrity spokesperson for AMDeC (Academic Medicine Development Company) and The New York Cancer Project.\n\nSusan Lucci, Emmy award winning actress, Broadway star, entrepreneur, and humanitarian, was honored by the City of New York as the mayor presented her with a key to the city to recognize her outstanding achievements. She has been awarded the Ellis Island Medal of Honor E! Entertainment noted Susan as the top entertainer of the year and she was also featured in Barbara Walters' special Barbara Walters Presents the Ten Most Fascinating People."
