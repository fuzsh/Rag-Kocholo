        "text": "GARDEN CITY, N.Y.\n\nTHE actress Susan Lucci has lived in the same house here since 1978. She grew up in Garden City, as she recounts in her new memoir, “All My Life,” being published this month by It Books. Her daughter, Liza Huber, who is expecting her third child, is raising her young family in Garden City, like her mother and grandmother before her.\n\nAnd though Ms. Lucci, 64, speaks fondly of her hometown — early in her career, local merchants would help hide her from paparazzi by saying they had not seen her, even when she was in their stores, she said in a recent interview — her decision to stay here was by no means a foregone conclusion.\n\n“This is a multigenerational town, but it’s funny — I never thought it was any place for me to stay,” the actress said from an elaborately upholstered love seat in her office, where she sometimes studies her “All My Children” scripts. Ms. Lucci has played Erica Kane — a character she describes in the book as “the kind that you just love to hate” — on the ABC daytime drama since 1970.\n\nMs. Lucci was nominated for an Emmy Award 18 times for the role before finally winning on her 19th nomination in 1999.\n\nWhen the actress began her career in the late 1960s, she said, “I had my sights set on Manhattan.” It was her husband, Helmut Huber, who suggested the move to Garden City in the early 1970s, shortly after they were married. They were living in an apartment in Forest Hills, Queens, at the time. “He said, ‘Garden City is beautiful.’ And he’s from the Austrian Alps! But he’s right,” she said.\n\nMs. Lucci had met Mr. Huber while working as a waitress at the Garden City Hotel, where he was the executive chef. In addition to Liza, they also raised their son, Andreas Huber, born five years after Liza, in 1980, in Garden City.\n\nIt was the younger Mr. Huber, who lives in Manhattan, who persuaded Ms. Lucci to do the book, written with Laura Morton.\n\n“About a year and a half ago, he just out of the blue said, ‘Mom, I think you should write a book,’ ” Ms. Lucci said.\n\n“He said that all the girls he dates, once they find out I’m his mom, they all want to know, ‘How did I do it? What am I like?’ ” she said.\n\nThen she reread the letters — from publishers and literary agents urging her to write a book — that her husband had saved over the years.\n\n“They all were saying what my son was saying — everybody knows Erica Kane, but nobody knows me,” she said. “So I started thinking about it.”\n\nThe result is a book that Ms. Lucci said might surprise her fans with its darker moments. She recounts a miscarriage, for example, and also her devastation over the death of her father not long after her husband received a diagnosis of prostate cancer in 2002. (He is now cancer free.)\n\n“It took awhile for me to get used to speaking candidly about my own life,” she said. But with Ms. Morton’s encouragement, she added, “I got into it, and it turned out to be a wonderful experience.”\n\nRecounting what she calls her “Cinderella moments” — hosting the Emmys as well as winning one, competing on “Dancing With the Stars” in 2008, playing the lead in “Annie Get Your Gun” on Broadway in 2000 — made her relax and even enjoy the process.\n\n“The book gave me the opportunity to share some of those amazing moments, to reflect and enjoy,” she said.\n\nNow that “All My Children,” which had been filmed in Manhattan studios for 40 years, has relocated to Glendale, Calif. — the move last year was made largely for financial reasons, she said — Ms. Lucci is feeling especially attached to her hometown, she said.\n\nCommuting to Southern California for her current shooting schedule of two weeks on, one week off, “I miss New York,” she said. Though she and Mr. Huber have an apartment near the new set, she added, “this is my home, and it’s a wonderful home.”\n\nLeaving it for long stretches is not the only concession she has made to continue playing Erica Kane. Ms. Lucci also accepted a pay cut when she signed her latest contract, which she says is up for renewal in around a year.\n\nAccording to Ms. Lucci, “Oprah let it slip” about the pay cut when she appeared on Ms. Winfrey’s show this year. “She asked me why I stayed, and I found myself saying I really like what I do,” she said. “But I also didn’t want to see a lot of people out of work — a lot of really good people — which was the way it was presented to me.”\n\nAlso, after four decades, she is no less attached to the role of Erica Kane than she was when she first accepted the part.\n\n“She’s been a joy from the start, and she’s obviously a huge part of my life,” Ms. Lucci said. “I never get tired of her.”"
