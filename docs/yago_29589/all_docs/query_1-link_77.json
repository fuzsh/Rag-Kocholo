        "text": "Janet Green/Jane Cox was fun. Robin Mattson was great as Janet from Another Planet. BTW, liked when Trevor has those sideburns around 1994. Her telling off the people of Pine Valley was nice too. Steve Kanely from Dallas was in the audience in the video as Seabone Hunkle.\n\nI also rather enjoyed the Adam and Stuart Chandler dynamic, especially when they appeared in the same scene.\n\nYes, Robin nailed that role. She knew how to make us viewers root for Janet! Such a shame neither she nor Kate Collins has an Emmy for playing Janet.\n\nThat court scene is a great example of why she deserves one. And has to be one of finest moments on the show. I remember Steve Kanely on the show he played Dixie's father. Trevor was very popular with female viewers, he got more fan mail than Both of actresses playing Janet lol.\n\nI enjoyed Adam and Stuart too. I always smiled when they acted together, I loved their storyline with Glory. Stuart is my favorite out of the bros. He just brings a lot of heart to the show.\n\nI think I loved all of Stuart pairings too!\n\nIn current story on General Hospital, an effort is being made to create crossover stories to AMC's Pine Valley and its characters. GH has already done this with links created to One Life to Live's Llanview and even Ryan's Hope's Riverside/New York City. GH characters visited and interacted with Jackson Montgomery at his PV office, and Willey has stated that Jack will appear again later this month. The most interesting aspect of the story however, hints that Martin Gray (a GH character played by AMC vet Michael E. Knight) not only lived in PV at one time, but was apparently married to a prominent, rich PV resident he only refers to as \"Ex-Wife #3\". The overwhelming hints lead the viewer to believe EW3 is in fact Erica Kane, though they have been VERY stingy with hints lately...in fact, they barely have mentioned Martin's mystery past with EW3 since Lucy and Felicia returned from Pine Valley. This might be an effect of the Writers' Strike, but they're obviously building up to something in an effort to do some fan service for AMC fans.\n\nThe hints about Martin's ex gives the idea that she is (or WAS) involved in the cosmetics industry and has Jack doing her legal work, which includes sending Martin $50k a month in alimony, ostensibly to keep his mouth shut about trade secrets from within her company. But wouldn't you know, he indirectly blabbed about one such trade secret to his girlfriend Lucy, who also runs a cosmetics company. She took his \"idea\" and developed a device to tighten wrinkles that is apparently a runaway success---but now that it's a success, he keeps telling Lucy not to disclose that he gave her the idea. He also refuses to marry Lucy because (she found out) he would then lose that $50k per month from EW3. Though it would be a major coup if they could get Susan Lucci to do a guest stint as Erica to nail Martin (and ruin Lucy's company), they have to be hedging their bets in case she opts not to make an appearance. It made me wonder if they could pick another popular (though not AS popular) AMC character to play EW3, someone who had more ties to Tad Martin (Michael E. Knight's AMC character). Knight might be a bit too old for Alicia Minshew's Kendall, but Kendall did have interest in a cosmetics company. My dream would be Marcy Walker's Liza, but Walker is no longer acting and is in fact a youth minister. Another good consolation prize would be Jennifer Bassey's Marian Colby....both could joke that \"Martin\" reminds them of another \"cad\" they became entangled with years before.\n\nIn current story on General Hospital, an effort is being made to create crossover stories to AMC's Pine Valley and its characters.

Jack acted as if he knew Martin from the marriage to EW3. It's all kind of weird since we are expected to have some characters cross over and know one another, while others \"look just like someone they know\" but nothing is said of the resemblance. Jack wanted to have Lucy and Felicia arrested for breaking into his office (trying to dig up dirt on Martin's divorce) but the ladies called Jack's \"old friend\" Anna Devane and she talked Jack into letting them go. Anna blackmailed Martin last year using the information she had about his third wife, but it was not stated in the conversation if she knows EW3 personally, or if she even knew the identity of EW3."
