        "text": "Long-running Soap Opera on ABC, premiering in 1970. Within the framework of a traditional Family Drama soap, Agnes Nixon created a show that incorporates young love, relevant social issues and high comedy. Its memorable Title Sequence, at least through 1989, showed a woman's hand opening a family photo album.\n\nThe show is set in fictional Pine Valley, Pennsylvania, close enough to New York for day travel. A notable character is much-married Erica Kane (Martin Brent Cudahy Chandler Roy Roy Montgomery Montgomery Chandler Marick Marick Montgomery), played since the show's inception by Susan Lucci. Lucci was famously nominated 18 times for a Daytime Emmy for this role without a win, finally winning on #19.\n\nOn April 14, 2011, it was announced that All My Children would be canceled. All My Children aired its last episode on September 23, 2011.\n\nMore information is available at David R. Jackson's soap opera site.\n\nTropes used in All My Children include:\n\nAB Negative: Greenlee/Jack, among others.\n\nAbsentee Actor: Ruth Warrick (Phoebe), Eileen Herlie (Myrtle), and James Mitchell (Palmer) were kept on contract long after their age and ill health made it impossible for them to work.\n\nAccidental Murder: Adam accidentally murders Stuart.\n\nStuart was brought back by Project Orpheus in the finale.\n\nAffectionate Parody: Greenlee's Gilligan's Island dream; the Martin family's Chicago dream.\n\nThe Alcoholic: Phoebe and Erica both develop serious drinking problems. Skye, Hayley and JR also became alcoholics.\n\nAntagonist in Mourning: Adam's shocked response to Palmer's death. Brooke gets him to concede that Palmer was a Worthy Opponent.\n\nAnti-Villain: David ruined a lot of lives, but he did show occasional moments of kindness.\n\nArch Enemy: Adam and Palmer; later, Adam and Tad.\n\nLiza and Damon.\n\nArtistic License Law: All trials in Pine Valley ignore every legal form known in the United States, ranging from protocols for questioning witnesses to rules for admitting evidence.\n\nThen again, given that for a large portion of the show the judges were always bribed/blackmailed/involved in the case, and this was usually explicitly commented on by whatever side lost...\n\nDavid and Greenlee's insta-eviction from Wildwind is hilariously out of whack with the relevant laws.\n\nAscended Fangirl: Five words: Carol Burnett as Verla Grubbs.\n\nAttention Deficit Ooh Shiny: Averted with Damon.\n\nAx Crazy: Alexander Cambias, Janet Green.\n\nBack for the Dead: Di Cooney, Zac Slater.\n\nBack From the Dead: Greenlee, Dixie (only to be killed off yet again), Maria, Tad, etc.\n\nAnd thanks to the Orpheus Project near then end of the show's tenure, Dixie, Zach, and possibly anybody and everybody else who has died.\n\nBecoming the Mask: Lenny Wlasik, initially posing as the scholarly Langley Wallingford, actually winds up getting a real doctorate and becoming a serious archeologist.\n\nBetty and Veronica: Jack (Veronica) and Caleb (Betty) for Erica, JR (Veronica) and Scott (Betty) for Annie.\n\nBig Fancy House: Wildwind, the Chandler Mansion, Cortlandt Manor not anymore, it burned down. And Tad's house must be awfully big to fit the amazing amount of people living there.\n\nBig Screwed-Up Family: The Cambias, Chandler, Cortlandt, and Lavery families all achieve transcendent levels of dysfunction.\n\nBolivian Army Cliffhanger: Just who did J.R. shoot? Was it Erica? Marissa? Someone else? Himself?\n\nBrother-Sister Incest: Narrowly avoided when Erica was engaged to Mark, who turned out to be her half-brother; her mother intervened before they could go through with it, and told them the truth.\n\nBut I Can't Be Pregnant: Opal.\n\nThe Cameo: Warren Buffett, of all people, who asked to appear on his favorite show.\n\nElizabeth Taylor. As a janitor. Surprising Verla Grubbs.\n\nRosie O'Donnell, who had a hilarious turn not as herself, but as a maid.\n\nThe Casanova: Tad \"The Cad\" Martin, especially before he met Dixie.\n\nCharacter Blog: I Am Erica Kane.\n\nChuck Cunningham Syndrome: The infamous Bobby Martin, many others. Taylor, most recently.\n\nComing Out Story: Michael Delaney, Kevin Sheffield, Bianca.\n\nCool Old Lady: Myrtle.\n\nCreator Cameo: Agnes Nixon has popped in for anniversary and memorial episodes.\n\nOpal: Oh, please! You'd think she built the town single-handed."
