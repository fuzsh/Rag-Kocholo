As the 41-year-old drama comes to a close (maybe it’s really faking it’s own death and will be back in time to marry General Hospital?), we take a look back at the genre.

Lee Harrington and Sam Ford, co-editors of the 2011 book The Survival of Soap Opera: Transformations for a New Media Era\n\n• Dr. Carole Lieberman, host of Dr. Carole’s Couch, and psychiatric script consultant for soap operas\n\nWe apologize, but this video has failed to load.\n\nTry refreshing your browser, or\n\ntap here to see other videos from our team.\n\nCulture Club: The demise of the daytime soap opera Back to video\n\nCarole: As the former psychiatric script consultant to The Young & the Restless and The Bold and the Beautiful for over 10 years, it saddens me tremendously to see the demise of soaps. This is attributable to a perfect storm of changes in society, rather than problems with the soaps, themselves. The demise is due to: fewer women staying at home during daytime, and those that are home being too busy to consistently include a soap into their schedule; the speedier pace of life making people too impatient to wait for the storyline of a soap to unfurl; and real life becoming less romantic, making it harder to relate to the plots about love, betrayal and passion, which now seem quaint and serve as bittersweet reminders of a time when our lives were more exciting and passionate.Sam: The most oft-cited culprits to explain the decline in soaps audiences over the years has been the proliferation of media and entertainment choices that have become available to people; the cultural changes that led to women entering the workforce; and, in particular, O.J. Simpson’s trial preempting the soaps off-and-on for months in the mid-1990s. Many of soaps’ attempts to hang onto viewers over the past few decades might be viewed as overcorrections that ended up doing more harm than good.\n\nAdvertisement 3\n\nStory continues below\n\nThis advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\n\nArticle content\n\nScott: Thirty years ago, soaps were the perfect vehicle to reach a large audience of women; I remember my mother would always watch Guiding Light while working around the house. That audience is largely gone, and that’s almost impossible to overcome. But that said, I’m intrigued by your notion of over-corrections. What kinds of things have soaps done in recent years that backfired?\n\nSam: Through focusing on a particular young couple, incorporating science fiction elements, some major celebrity appearances, and a variety of other initiatives, [General Hospital] not only gained massive viewership and saved their show from the chopping block, but they also gained a visibility outside the soap opera fan base that had been unprecedented. That was, I would argue, absolutely the right thing to do for that show. Every show began to jump on board with doing something similar. Soaps became particularly ridiculous when they went for bigger budgets, more explosions, action/adventure, and so on, and many fans became desensitized to these “quick fixes.”\n\nC. Lee: On another note, I also think that audiences are increasingly used to shorter and shorter entertainment “bites” rather than the full-blown “meals” that open-ended serials provide. We are seeing U.S. primetime TV series debut with six-episode seasons (e.g. the wildly popular The Walking Dead), and the idea of adopting a daily viewing habit of a decades-long program has lost its appeal (or never gained appeal) for many viewers.\n\nAdvertisement 4\n\nStory continues below\n\nThis advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\n\nArticle content\n\nScott: My soap-watching days are largely limited to a brief spell in university when roommates were into The Young & the Restless, but I remember being amazed at how long it took for plots to develop. A tense conversation between two characters could be drawn out over days. Even accounting for the soap-character tendency toward furrowed brows and dramatic pauses, things did seem to move at a glacial pace, so I guess it’s not surprising that messing with the formula didn’t work. That said, does anyone think that, had the long-running soaps focused on traditional soap storytelling, they would not be in the same sort of trouble today?\n\nLee: They would still be in trouble, no question, but they would have been better able to retain a viable audience. As a long-time viewer myself it’s heartening to see the few remaining soaps honing in on quality … I have watched General Hospital for years and the current head-writer is doing a fantastic job, paying homage to the history and the depth of the narrative and the characters while at the same time telling compelling stories.\n\nMelissa:I know Erica Kane as well as I know my own mother. But my friends and I stopped watching when we got into university. That being said, we became addicted to Felicity, Grey’s Anatomy and then Desperate Housewives which I believe are soap operas, just at night.\n\nAdvertisement 5\n\nStory continues below\n\nThis advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\n\nArticle content\n\nC. Lee: Yes, there are lots of primetime shows that have very successfully adopted serial storytelling, thus adding to the competition for viewers.\n\nScott: Melissa hits on an interesting point. I knew lots of people who watched soaps in high school, but do younger viewers watch them at all now? There’s so much choice for them, from Pretty Little Liars to reality TV, that I would suspect that part of the audience has dropped away, too.\n\nC.Lee: They are having a much harder time attracting a youth audience and given population aging in general, the audience is getting older and older every year, thus aging out of the target demographic of corporate sponsors. So there still is an audience for daytime soaps but it’s dwindling AND it is increasingly comprised of an audience that the sponsors do not want, even though older adults DO have buying power.\n\nSam: Soaps traditionally have appealed to audiences who like these deep and messy histories, etc. The less soap operas pay attention to what they can do that primetime shows cannot do (i.e. these extensive histories, character relationships, etc.), the more these shows become cheaper versions of what viewers can see elsewhere.\n\n• Email: mleong@ nationalpost.com | Twitter: lisleong\n\nArticle content\n\nShare this article in your social network\n\nLatest from Shopping Essentials"
