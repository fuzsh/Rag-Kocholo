        "text": "General Hospital sets the stage for an exciting plot arc as Walt Willey makes his entrance into the series as Jack Montgomery.\n\nThe legal drama around Drew Cain is about to take an unexpected turn, drawing parallels to a previous plot from All My Children (AMC).\n\nWe delve into the implications of this new development, exploring the potential outcomes for Drew. And how Jack Montgomery could be the key to resolving the insider trading case.\n\nThe following is a transcript from a new General Hospital video. Watch the video in the article. And be sure to check us out on YouTube as well.\n\nBreaking News for General Hospital Fans\n\nHey there, General Hospital fans, we have got some breaking news. We have figured out why Jack Montgomery from All My Children is coming to General Hospital. We have sussed out what we believe is Walt Willey’s first plot, his only plot. The plot that’s revealed of why they have brought him from Pine Valley to Port Charles.\n\nWalt Willey’s Arrival to GH\n\nAll right, so we already know for sure that actor Walt Willey, famous for All My Children playing Jack Montgomery, that everybody called Jack, is coming to General Hospital.\n\nNew Character Arc on General Hospital for Jack Montgomery\n\nHe’s going to breathe new life into the role of Jack Montgomery for a stint on GH. But why — why are they bringing this Pine Valley lawyer onto the show?\n\nWell, Things are about to change next week that are going to explain very succinctly that it ties back in almost just very similitude to a plot on All My Children years ago.\n\nDrawing Parallels – Past Plots from AMC and Upcoming Changes on GH\n\nSo if you don’t remember Jack, he was one of Erica Kane’s favorite husbands, and he’s a top-notch attorney. And he’s got some case history that could help a Port Charles local who’s in a legal dilemma.\n\nSo there’s this huge twist next week for Drew Cain. We’re pretty sure this is what is driving the Jack Montgomery All My Children/General Hospital crossover and why they hired Walt Willey for this arc.\n\nAMC’s Famous Insider Trading Plot – A Recap\n\nSo, If you’re not an AMC watcher or if you don’t remember, we’re just going to give you a two-second recap. Back in 2008 on All My Children, Erica Kane, played masterfully, of course, by Susan Lucci, was caught insider trading, and there was a scandal.\n\nShe was sent to prison. They even had billionaire investor Warren Buffet show up on one of these AMC episodes. He’s the Oracle of Omaha.\n\nThe Arrival of Jack Montgomery to Port Charles – What It Means for General Hospital\n\nIf you didn’t know that, he’s a billionaire. He’s this master stock picker. All right, so he showed up to visit Erica while she was in prison and tried to help her, but instead, it was her ex. I think they were divorced at that time.\n\nThey married more than once, but she was still stewing behind bars until Jack Montgomery helped get her out. He was able to get Erica released early, and then Erica came back home to Pine Valley.\n\nLegal Complications for Drew Cain on GH – An Insider Trading Dilemma\n\nSo in very similar circumstances, Drew Cain‘s lawyer, Zeke Robinson, worked out a deal to get him. A plea deal if he would plead guilty to insider trading, and he decided he was going to do this to protect Carly.\n\nSo Zeke worked out a deal with the DA or the State Attorney General, whoever is handling it, where Drew will serve six months at cushy Spring Ridge.\n\nThe Expected Plot Twist on General Hospital – Drew’s Sentence at\n\nRemember, that’s the low-key prison where Esme served some time, and Spencer got to serve out, I think, the last part of his sentence, or the first part of it, one part of his sentence.\n\nAt any rate, at Spring Ridge, it’s a much nicer place. That’s where Heather Webber got to visit with her daughter Esme. So, as prisons go, it’s not bad.\n\nA Blow to Drew on GH – Facing Hard Time\n\nSix months isn’t that bad. Drew figures he can do that. He can be away from Scout for that long, and it’ll keep Carly Corinthos Spencer with her kids. However, the judge in his case decides to make an example out of Drew Cain and tosses out the plea deal.\n\nLegal Procedures and Unexpected Twists on General Hospital\n\nIn case you didn’t know this, the way a plea deal generally works is you plead guilty either to a few of the charges are to a lesser charge. But basically, a plea deal is where you render a guilty plea, and your lawyer negotiates a more lenient sentence for you.\n\nNot wasting the court’s time by having to have a trial and all this kind of stuff. The trick is that the agreement is between your defense lawyer and the district attorney, and there is no guarantee that the judge has to accept the deal.\n\nDrew Cain’s Fate on GH – A Glimpse into the Near Future\n\nHe can turn around and act on your guilty plea that you entered as part of the plea deal, and then based on what you pleaded guilty to, can punish you to the full extent of the law that they feel like doing.\n\nSo that is what is going to happen. So in this General Hospital case, the judge slaps Drew with not six months but two years, and it’s not at cushy Spring Ridge.\n\nPentonville Penitentiary: The Grim Reality on General Hospital\n\nIt is hard time at Pentonville Penitentiary, where they keep the really bad guys like Cyrus Renault. So the main thing is, you know, Drew is an ex-Navy Seal who spent years in this horrible captivity at the hands of Peter August and awful Victor Cassadine. So certainly, he can look out for himself, but the bottom line is it’s not necessarily that he’s at Pentonville.\n\nThe Impending Impact of Walt Willey’s Character on GH\n\nIt’s that it’s two years away from everyone. So he is shocked, and Carly is furious next week. But then that puts him in the same position that Erica Kane was in on All My Children. Where he is in prison for insider trading.\n\nAnd then we have this casting news about Walt Willey showing up as Jack Montgomery. He’s headed to Port Charles in just a couple of weeks.\n\nJack Montgomery’s Expected Role in Drew’s Case on General Hospital\n\nHe’s showing up in July. And I suspect that they are going to use his expertise in that past insider trading case to extricate Drew from Pentonville. Maybe they’ll get him back to his original sentence at Spring Ridge.\n\nOr maybe Jack is such a hotshot lawyer now that he’ll be able to just get the case dropped completely. We’ll have to wait and see. But I am increasingly certain that we have figured out Jack Montgomery’s plot.\n\nAnd the reason that they are bringing this character over from All My Children. Are you excited to see Jack Montgomery?\n\nAre you a big fan of Walt Willey’s and All My Children and thrilled with this crossover? Don’t miss a minute to see if Jack Montgomery can help Drew on the ABC center."
