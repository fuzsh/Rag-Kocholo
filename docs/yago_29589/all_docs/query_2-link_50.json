Kendall told Greenlee that she and Ryan had talked about his visit with the doctor. Ryan told Greenlee that he would do anything he had to do so that nobody else gets hurt by the Lavery legacy. Kendall and Greenlee bantered back and forth about who knew Ryan best and Kendall told Greenlee that she didn't know what was going on with him. Greenlee told Kendall that although she and Ryan had a history, their marriage was a completely different relationship. Greenlee told her that there were no secrets in their marriage. Ryan said that he and Greenlee had talked through everything and Kendall said she was relieved that he had told Greenlee all about his visit to the doctor's office. Greenlee asked what the problem was and Ryan told her that the doctor clarified some things for him and he felt better. Kendall, not about to let it go, told Greenlee and Ryan that she wished them luck with their new and improved totally honest relationship. Greenlee poured her and Ryan a glass of wine and began telling him what she had told Jack to convince him to get back with Erica. Ryan then told her that Kendall was not trying to cause trouble between them and that he had told the doctor that he could not risk bringing a child into the world. Greenlee, still under the impression that the doctor to whom Ryan referred was a counselor and not one who performed vasectomies, told him she would stick by him no matter what. She continued to talk about how their children would not be twisted, but would be like them. He told Greenlee that every decision he made was to protect her and for their marriage.\n\nSam asked Tad if he could live with him. Tad asked Sam when he found out that he was part of the Martin family. Maria followed her hunch and called Tad to find Sam. He told her that he would take Sam home. Anita told Maria to stop blaming herself. She told Maria that both she and Sam needed time. Sam continued to insist that he wanted to find and live with either of his biological parents. He told Tad that if he wouldn't help find his parents, he would do it on his own. Tad told Sam to be honest and admit that this wasn't about being adopted but about being mad at his mother. Maria told Sam that she knew she made mistakes and she took the blame for her mistakes. She also told him that she understood that he was mad but not to give up because she loved him more than life. Tad told Sam to face his problems and deal with them but no to run from them. Tad told Maria that Sam didn't hate her, but that he was just angry and confused.\n\nJ.R taunted Jamie about the details of Phoebe's will. Not only would Jamie have to give up Babe to get his inheritance, but Phoebe also put J.R. in charge of Jamie's trust. Phoebe further instructed that J.R. is to monitor Jamie making sure that he dumped \"that floozy\" and at that time J.R. is to make opportunities available for Jamie at the best schools. Babe apologized to Jamie and he told her that she had no reason to be sorry. J.R. called Babe a loser and Jamie told him he could take the money straight to hell. Brooke told J.R. that he didn't hold all the cards and J.R. told Jamie that it was only a matter of time until he sees Babe for the dish rag she really was. Tad told Jamie that whatever he decided, he would be behind him one hundred percent. Jamie told Brooke that there was no way he was leaving Babe and that he didn't want the inheritance. Brooke and the attorney left Jamie and Babe alone to talk. Brooke assured Jamie that there were ways around Phoebe's will and they would find it. Babe told Jamie if she had known that he had ambitions of being a doctor that she would have never let him help kidnap little Adam or go into hiding. Jamie told her that he didn't care about the money and Babe told him that everyone cared about money. She told him that his Aunt Phoebe had made it so easy for him to go to school and become a doctor and he told her that she might as well have asked him to rip out his heart. Babe told him that she loved him as much as he loved her but he needed to seriously consider Phoebe's offer.\n\nJack kidnapped Erica and took her to a yacht. He told her that he put seventeen years into loving her and he was not going to walk away without a fight. She asked Jack what he expected to gain from kidnapping her and he replied, \"an apology\". Erica told him the only thing she was sorry for was trusting him. Jack offered Erica her favorite, penne putanesca. Erica ambled to the table, picked up the plate of pasta, opened Jack's jacket and dumped it in. Jack then picked up the dessert plate and just when it looked like it may be a scene from \"Animal House\", he put the plate down and told her he wouldn't stoop that low. Erica told Jack that she would not put up with such tyranny and he replied that she would put up with it until she apologized to him and he would then decide if it would be worth continuing their relationship. He told her that she loved him until he wouldn't obey her orders. Jack continued to try to get Erica to say she was wrong. Erica told Jack that he too was to blame. Jack told her that she was looking for a yes man and she told him that she was looking for someone who would support her. She told Jack that she had to resort to desperate measures. He asked her what she meant and she told him that she had offered to marry Zach instead of Kendall. Jack told her that he needed some air and to put some distance between the two of them before he did something he regretted for the rest of his life. Erica, resourceful as always escaped from the locked cabin through the window.\n\nKendall went to Zach's house, told him to get a bottle of champagne and his car keys because they were driving to the nearest justice of the peace to get married. She told him whatever doubts she had about marrying for business were over because coupling for love sucks. She listed the dysfunctional couples of Pine Valley and said she wanted vows that stood for money, power and revenge. He told her that she and Ethan still had a shot at happiness and she needed to think about that. She told Zach that she didn't give a damn about Ethan and he asked her if she would be that flip when Ethan looked at her as if he wanted to tear her heart out. He told Kendall that Ethan will hate her and she needed to prepare for that. J.R. overheard and told Kendall not to worry because he would be there to help her through it. Zach told \"Junior\" to go inside because the grownups were talking. Kendall told Zach to be nice to her lover. J.R. offered to stand up for Zach at his wedding and went inside to wait for Kendall. Zach told her that their open marriage went both ways and he too had a proposal earlier. Kendall asked who the lucky lady was and he told her it was her mother. He told Kendall that Erica offered her hand in marriage so that she wouldn't have to marry him. He also told Kendall that he turned Erica down. Zach told Kendall to consider the fallout their marriage would cause. J.R. then entered and told Kendall that she thinks too much, and kissed her passionately.\n\nMay 17th, 2005- Despite Jamie's objections, Babe continues to pressure him to take Phoebe's offer. She says that he should go to school and be a doctor. Jamie says that she is his future and so is Little Adam. Babe says he got kicked out of school, can't get a good job or a decent place to live because of her. Jamie says there is no need to talk about it, nothing has changed and money does not matter. \"I wouldn't kiss you off for any amount of money,\" he says. Babe admits she is worried he will resent her later on if he does not take the deal. Jamie gets frustrated and walks out. He meets Babe back at their home after going out on a ride to clear his head and tells her he has made a decision about Phoebe's offer. He passionately kisses her and says the money does not matter. Babe asks him if he sure about his decision. He says Phoebe was a woman who could hold a grudge, but not him. The only thing Phoebe accomplished was making him love Babe even more than ever because she put him first, Jamie says. He tells her that no one can buy him out to stop loving her, even Phoebe or JR and they make love.\n\nKendall pushes JR away and they go inside and continue kissing, but Kendall stops him. She says when he tells her what to do, he is breaking their \"no strings attached\" agreement. JR tells her he will back off and try to just be her friend. Kendall asks him to leave and give her space. JR tells her about Ethan's bribe and that he turned him down. Kendall is surprised that he refused Ethan's offer. JR says that he was disgusted by the offer and for some reason, Ethan thinks he is controlling her. JR tells her not to worry about Ethan-he would rather steal it from him than hand it over. Kendall asks him to if he is falling for her. JR admits he is falling in lust for her, but love is only for naive people. Kendall asks JR how Ethan reacted when he found out that they slept together. JR says Ethan seemed nonchalant and will forgive her, if she wants him too. Kendall admits he is not sure what she wants and if she marries Zach, it will crush Ethan and put her at the top of his enemy list. JR tells there is nothing bad about Zach's offer and she should not have to lower her expectations for him. \"He was willing to trade you like stock. That's love?\" JR asks. Kendall says, maybe she shouldn't have expected Ethan to change himself for her. That is how she lost Ryan, she says. Kendall tells JR she is calling Ethan but he takes the telephone from her. JR tells her that Ethan only cared about revenge on his father and he never cared about her. Kendall says that she can't always have it her way. JR asks her to get some rest and decide it tomorrow. Kendall admits she just wants to be happy, despite her knack for going after bad boys. After some persuasion, she leads JR into her bedroom. After making love, JR sleeps and Kendall thinks about Zach's offer, Ethan's bribe to JR and Ethan proposing to her. She looks at JR and puts her robe on. She goes over to see Zach and says she has the answer to his marriage proposal. Ethan pays a visit to someone to see if they can help him get Kendall back.\n\nMaria comes to see Zach at his home, saying she owes him something, but Zach tells her he owes her nothing. Maria thanks him for helping her find her children. She tells him there is something he can do for her and he agrees, citing that if it involves her children, it won't work because they hate him. Maria says her kids hating him if by no means his fault. Zach realizes that Maria has come to say good-bye and feels that it is overdue. With him being around, her and the children can't heal, he says. The problems with her family and children started before he came back into her life, Maria says. She brings up his proposed marriage to Kendall and he tells her he doesn't love her. Maria reminds him it is not her business-she is there to say good-bye so she can focus on her children. Before she walks off, Zach apologizes for things he has done to hurt her. Maria tearfully tells him she is grateful to him for loving her. \"I didn't really have a choice,\" he says. Maria expresses how much she loved him and asks for one last kiss before leaving. They share a kiss and Maria holds him closely in tears. She pulls away from him, as tears roll across Zach's face, and leaves.\n\nJackson goes to check on Erica and finds nothing but her high-heels next to an open porthole. He leaves the room and calls her name, thinking she has gone overboard and a splash is heard. Erica emerges from inside a bench and calls out his name to try to stop him. She opens the door and Jackson is standing there, completely dry. Erica said she tossed plants out the window, Jackson threw a chair in the ocean because he knew she wouldn't jump in the water. She admits that she was worried when she thought he had jumped in the water. Erica asks him what they should do next. Jackson apologizes for his crack about her involvement with Maddie. Erica accepts his apology, then says she is sorry for proposing to Zach to meddle with Kendall's life and get revenge on Jackson. Erica tells him his apologies are far from over but Jackson has no clue what she means. She reminds him about his meddling in Greenlee's life, but Jackson refuses to apologize for caring about his daughter. They agree that from now on, their adult children's lives are their own and their lives are their own. They share a kiss and Erica is relieved that the fighting is over. Jackson tells her there is one more matter to resolve and carries into the bedroom. He asks her to marry him again.\n\nMay 18, 2005- Erica woke up in Jack's arms and told him to tell the captain to dock this boat; they have to get home, they're getting married now! Erica learned of Jack's secret desire to someday cruise the world in a yacht like the one they had enjoyed the night before. Erica and Jack docked at a resort in Boca Raton, Florida, and decided to be married there. Erica looked around at the magnificent old Banyan tree; she felt it was Kismet and declared, \"Jack, our wedding it has to be here! The resort rep told Erica, \"It is our pleasure to give you the wedding of your dreams. Jack and Erica reached all their children to share the happy news.\n\nLily was surprised when Aidan opened the door at Wildwind, and told him, \"I'm here to see my boyfriend, and it's not you. Lily told Aidan she was angry at him for ruining her great plan. Aidan was surprised and concerned to learn that Sam was Lily's new boyfriend. Sam told Lily he would be honored to be her boyfriend, and Lily asked if he was ready to practice touching? Lily and Sam came to an understanding that Lily called \"Tres Bien no sex!\n\nReggie apologized to Dani and told her he was willing to wait until she's ready to make love. Reggie was speechless when Lily told him, \"I'm just practicing touching and kissing my boyfriend.\n\nRyan waits impatiently to be scheduled for his procedure. Then Ryan surprises Greenlee with flowers and champagne for their anniversary, followed by the gift of an expensive necklace. Greenlee and Ryan marked their first anniversary with different ideas about their happy future. Kendall asked, \"You still planning on go through with it? Ryan said yes, \"Keep your mouth shutnot one word to Greenlee! Kendall said she hoped Greenlee loves Ryan as much as she says she does. If she doesn't, she has a very good chance of just saying \"Hasta la vista to him! Greenlee suggested they could turn the trip into a little vacation of their own, but Ryan said he wasn't going; he didn't want to ruin Erica's special day, and had another doctor's appointment that he was sure would help him.\n\nRyan urged Greenlee to go without him, promising they would pick right back up where they left off. Kendall asked \"It'll be one hell of a homecoming, won't it, Ryan?\n\nThursday, May 19, 2005- When Greenlee, Kendall, Reggie and Lily arrived in Boca Raton for the wedding, Erica was surprised that Ryan wasn't with them. Kendall assures her mother and Jack that Ryan had his reasons for remaining in Pine Valley. As Erica showed everyone to their rooms, Kendall slipped away in the other direction. Lily was upset to learn this would be Erica's 10th wedding, saying she broke her promise nine times, \"Are you going to break your promise to my dad, too? After explaining to Lily how long she's loved Jack, Erica vows that this marriage will be the one that lasts a lifetime. Zach showed up in Boca Raton, Greenlee saw Zach and Kendall together on the beach, but Ms. Hart denied that Slater was there. Greenlee tricked Zach into going with her to a storage room; she said Kendall told her everything. Greenlee locked Zach in a storage closet and told him there was no way he was going to marry Kendall! Kendall tells Greenlee she has no intention of tying the knot with Zach. Bianca beamed as she got off the boat and told her daughter, \"Miranda, look! It's your family! Bianca and Miranda are reunited with their family, while Ethan's arrival irks Kendall and she walks away from him. Reggie looks forward to playing golf with his dad while the ladies luxuriate in a spa treatment.\n\nRyan was drinking at the Roadside Bar when Simone came in. Ryan got a call from Dr. Cooper's nurse, saying they had a cancellation and could fit him in for his procedure. J.R. taunted Jamie about Babe and the money, and Ryan about his brothers, provoking Ryan to attack him. Ryan left the bar, saying there was someplace he had to be. Simone followed Ryan to a dark apartment building, where he knocked on a door that was opened by a blond woman. When he said he knows he's early, the woman smiled, \"No problem. We're always here for you.\n\nJamie told J.R. of his decision to stay with Babe and relinquish his claim to Phoebe's estate. J.R. opened the safe and demanded, \"Where the hell is the money?\n\nAidan told Tad his operatives had caught up to where their Jane Doe was about six months ago, back at the hospital in Germany where she had the reconstructive surgery on her face. She just wanted to say thanks and goodbye before she left the country for the United States. Tad's eyes widened as he looked at one of the interviews with everyone who might have come into contact with their Jane Doe, and exclaimed, \"Oh, my God! Tad learned that Diana Cole started working at that German hospital just before their Jane Doe stopped by to say auf wiedersehen, and she wasn't hired as a doctor or a nurse; she works with children as a nanny. \"Another coincidence? Aidan asked. Tad said no way.\n\nDi was upset to see Amanda wearing Dixie's wishing star necklace, and didn't buy the girl's story that J.R. had casually given it to her; she raised her eyebrows and nodded slightly when Amanda asked, \"You really think I'm a liar and a thief? Though Amanda claims that JR gave her his mother's necklace, Di accuses the girl of stealing the bauble and orders her to hand it over. Hearing Di ask J.R. if she saw him open the safe, Amanda burst in and accused the nanny of stealing the $10,000!\n\nMay 20, 2005- Babe and Jamie come home, and Babe has big plans to spoil her man for the day. Jamie is puzzled because Babe usually wants to nap after a long day. Undeterred, Babe does a mini strip tease, turns on some music and asks him to dance. She tells him that she also plans to give him a full body massage, and Jamie couldn't be happier. Before she can make another move, he picks up his future bride and takes her to bed. After making love, there is a little small talk before Jamie wants to go for another round. Babe is willing, but first she wants to deliver another part of his surprise. She tells him that she did a lot of research on the internet and then hands him plane tickets to a town in Mexico where there is a medical school that JR couldn't have barred him from. She wants him to fly out there, check out the school and the teachers, and then start there next semester. However, instead of being happy, Jamie is upset. He tells her that she is his dream, and that before the will was read, they were enough for each other. He still believes that they are and he needs her to believe that nothing has changed. Babe thinks that it has - she notes that he will never find out that she has some secret dreams because all she wants is a family: the two of them, and Little Adam. She thinks that he isn't giving their relationship enough credit by just accepting her dream as something shared. Jamie tells her that they've already made it through the most difficult times in their lives and into each other's arms. Now, he doesn't need to be anything other than with her. The next morning, Jamie wakes up and rolls over to see Babe staring at the plane ticket she bought. He tells her that the night before was amazing because he got to tell the woman that he loves how he feels. She is still stuck on the idea that he is giving up his dream for her, but he tells her that they are a miracle. They've gone through hell and back and they still have each other. He then tells her that he's not worried, because everything else will work out on its own.\n\nAt the Chandler mansion, Adam walks in on Amanda telling JR that Di stole money from the safe. Amanda is certain there has to be a reason for the betrayal, and Adam is quick to say it's because Diana can't be trusted. Smugly, he notes that his instincts about her were right from day one. He offers to call the police and handle Di's dismissal for his son, but JR will have none of it. Instead, he asks Diana directly is she took the money, and she tells him no. Adam is stunned, and warns his son that he shouldn't miss the warning signs right in front of him. JR, sure that he had missed something along the way, asks his father to fill him in. Adam tells him that Di took the job and joined their family simply to steal from them. Amanda takes that as her cue to leave, believing the conversation to be family business. JR stops her from going too far, and reluctantly, Amanda stops her flight. Adam thinks that he can prove that he is right by performing a search of Di's room, and goes to do just that. JR warns her that Adam doesn't say things like that lightly, and Di appears unfazed. JR makes note of this as Di explains what really happened. She tells her employer that this was Amanda's way of showing her who was boss in the house. JR looks puzzled, so Di continues by telling him that she caught Amanda with Dixie's star pendant on, and asked her to put it back where she found it. Enraged, Amanda decided that Di needed to be taught a lesson. Amanda interjects an apology, and JR, anger flashing in his eyes at this new revelation, is amazed that she is owning up to what she did so easily. Amanda corrects him, saying that her apology is because Di is dragging him into her lies. She spins a tale about how she saw people \"like Di\" lying effortlessly at the institution. She goes so far as to say that Di shouldn't be around his son, or anyone else's children. After a moment of consideration, JR announces that it's one woman's word against another's. Amanda tells him that it's understandable if he wants to believe the lie - because that's easier. Just then, Adam comes into the room, holding the proof that Di committed the crime - $500 hidden under her mattress. JR doesn't believe it's their money until Adam tells him that he keeps notes on the serial numbers of the cash in the safe, and a piece of paper found with the money in Di's room confirms his truth. With Amanda looking on smugly, JR asks that they both leave him alone with Di so that he can handle the situation.\n\nA short time later, Adam and son are in the living room alone, and Adam believes that he missed the arrival and departure of the police. He asks if Di had confessed and left on her own. Before JR can answer, Di walks back into the living room holding the littlest Chandler. Outraged, Adam demands to know why she is still in the house, much less holding Little Adam. JR blithely replies that Di is doing what she is paid to do. Adam is flustered and somewhat speechless when Amanda reenters through the patio door. Seeing the room's occupants, she thinks that the showdown is still on, and offers to go back out for a while. Once again, JR stops her and tells her she is just the person he wants to see. He calmly asks her to leave the room with him, and perplexed, she follows. They head up to her room and as she watches, JR pries open her journal. Inside, instead of pages, he finds the remaining $9500. JR admonishes her for her plan of weaseling her way into their house just to rip them off and initially, Amanda tries to appear sorry. She says that ever since she left Pine Valley with her family, her mother has been in and out of hospitals. JR reminds her that insurance would pay for all of that, and that Trevor could make sure of it. Hearing her father's name, she switches tacks and says that her parents are so wrapped up in each other that they probably aren't aware that she is gone. She tells JR that she came to Pine Valley because she thought she would be safe. Then she says that registration is due at school, and this sets JR off. He tells her that she could have stolen the money from her father just as easily. Amanda swears that she wants to start anew, and that she plans to pay back everything. JR tells her that she can keep the money because he doesn't care about it. What he does care about it that she targeted them, committed the crime and then tried to pin it on someone innocent. He demands that she pack her things and leave his house. Distraught, Amanda begs for a second chance and a way that she could make it up to him. She tries to convince him by hugging him and begging him, and then resorts to kissing him. He lets the kiss linger for a moment, and then breaks it off roughly, slightly amused at just how grownup she is. She tells him that a little sex never hurt anyone, and offers to make it up to him in that way. Still angry, JR rejects her, saying that no amount of sex can make up for what she did. Amanda, her act gone and her attitude back in full force, tells him that all she really did was upset the nanny - and that she could apologize to her, but he'd be more fun. JR rejects her again, and leaves the room. The next morning, JR awakens Amanda by whispering in her ear. She makes another offer to make amends by sleeping with him, but that's not even close to what JR wants. He admits that she really owes him and then cryptically asks how much she likes Jamie.\n\nKendall explodes into her room in a rage, with Bianca not far behind. Kendall asks her sister how she could bring Ethan to the wedding, throwing him in both her and Erica's faces. Bianca, sure that Ethan filled her in on everything that had gone on since her departure, tells Kendall that she had no choice but to interfere, because there is no way she would allow Kendall to marry Zach. Bianca is shocked that Kendall would even consider such a thing when she still loves Ethan. Kendall tells her that Ethan made his choice, and Bianca lets on that she believes his choice was to be with Kendall. A light dawns, and Kendall realizes that as usual, Ethan didn't tell the whole truth. She takes a moment to tell her sister that she said she would marry Ethan - if he signed over his shares of Cambias to his father. Shocked, Bianca admits she had no idea. Just then, there is a knock at the door, and Bianca opens it and finds Ethan on the other side. Irritated, she tells him that the next time he decides to use her to get what he wants, he'd better tell her the whole truth. She leaves the room in a huff of exasperation, leaving the former lovebirds alone. This doesn't last long, as it takes only mere seconds for Kendall to cross the room and slam the door in his face. Not willing to give up so easily, Ethan pounds on the door, demanding to be let in. Kendall isn't backing down, however. Incensed that he dragged her sister into their mess, she rages at him about being done with him and his lies. She tells him through the closed door that he needs to get away from her door and get out of the country, because she doesn't want to see his face again.\n\nGreenlee checks the handle on the door where she has locked Zach away. She indignantly berates him for daring to show up at the wedding. She then informs him that only one wedding will take place, and it isn't his. She stalks off, leaving Zach to inspect his latest jail cell. He finds a caged bird inside and enlists it as his sounding board.\n\nJack enters a suite with Erica in his arms, and she is raging at him. He puts her down, closes the door and lets her vent. She is upset that Ethan showed up, that he was again going after one daughter while dragging another along for assistance, and that Jack hauled her away from the scene, refusing to let her interfere. She continues on this path for a few minutes and then collapses into tears. She realizes how quickly she has fallen into her old habits, and she begs Jack to not let her ruin their wedding after all they had done to get there. True emotions not swayed by her outburst, he simply calms the love of his life with a kiss.\n\nHours later, Kendall returns from dinner with her mother and soon-to-be stepfather. Erica is delighted that they were able to sup without Cambias presence. Kendall agrees, and then insists that they spend no more time on anything non-essential. They talk for a few more minutes, Kendall expresses how happy she is that the duo will finally wed, and then Erica sends her daughter off to bed, noting that she expects high energy from all parties. She starts to tack on some advice for her daughter, if Ethan should come sniffing around - but Kendall is already on the job. She shows off the \"Do Not Disturb\" sign that she plans to hang on her door, and her heart.\n\nOut on the beach, Ethan sits in the dark on a bench. Bianca approaches him, sees the look on his face, and can't help but to stop and chat. She marvels at how he so easily flew to Paris, pled his case, convinced her to join forces with him - only to find out that he wasn't entirely truthful. Ethan tells her that he believes Kendall's conditions to actually be blackmail. He laments that although he thought Kendall loved him enough to marry him - he was wrong. Bianca tells him that he should expect no less than the ultimatum Kendall put forth, but Ethan responds that she asked him for the impossible: to give up everything that he had. Bianca reminds him that he would still have his love for her, and that's not a bad thing. Ethan tells her that he came to America to find his family and his true surname, and that even Bianca felt that it was important once upon a time. He reminds her that he was ready to walk away from everything when she offered him what she thought was her last connection to her daughter. Bianca tells him she did that because she never thought that Ethan would make money more important than Kendall. Ethan swears that Kendall was actually the one that made money more important when she asked him to choose - but Bianca offers another viewpoint: that Ethan was the guilty party when he lied to Kendall just to get back at his father. She then tells him that perhaps Kendall's ultimatum was the best thing that could have happened to him. She goes on to remind him that while Kendall loves him, if he surrendered his possessions, he would be free of all of the bad stemming from it, and he could focus on a life with Kendall. Ethan doesn't think that being penniless is the way to go, but Bianca tells him that she knows his bank account isn't the reason that he hangs on to his part of the empire. She says that it's because he has a need to keep a connection between him and his father. Ethan is quick to deny this, but Bianca reminds him that she was there when he found out that Zach really was his father but denied him. She knows how devastating that was for him - and she also knows that if he can't have his father's love, he will hang on to his inheritance as a way to keep the connection alive. Unwilling to admit that he was at fault, Ethan tries one more time to blame it on his father, saying that Zach's lies set everything in motion. He also notes that if there is a Cambias curse, it won't touch him. Bianca stops him, saying that she already sees the change in him, and that change breaks her heart. She urges a despondent Ethan to let it all go if he wants to get Kendall back. He asks her what he will have left if he takes her advice. With a smile, Bianca tells him that he will have Kendall - and goes on to say that when she is brave enough, Kendall loves with a force unparalleled by any other. In addition, he would gain Kendall's whole family, including Bianca, Miranda, Jack, and Erica. Ethan wryly tells her that including Jack and Erica would be pushing it too far. Acquiescing, Bianca tells him that family is a miracle - and notes that he knows that because he's been searching for it his whole life. She also reminds him that Kendall knows where he is coming from, and that when she was finally able to let go of her father, she was then able to find her way back to her sister and her mother. Bianca tells him that Kendall only wants the same thing for Ethan - and if he is brave enough to reach out and take it, she will meet him on the other side. She further notes that what he would get out of a positive relationship with Kendall and all of the people connected to her is worlds more than what he could ever get by holding on to his Cambias connections. Ethan starts to consider her words and she gives him a hug. He hugs her back for a moment, and then she bids him good night.\n\nKendall answers her door and Greenlee invites herself in. Kendall insists that she is busy, but Greenlee isn't giving up the fight. Greenlee thinks that they should celebrate because they will officially be sisters when Jack and Erica marry. Kendall is unmoved, and repeatedly asks Greenlee to leave her alone. Greenlee spots Kendall's license and passport on the table and offers to store it for her in her safe, but exasperated, Kendall grabs her things and says it's unnecessary. She then launches into a mini rant at Greenlee, ending by saying that she understands why 'he' didn't tell her. Intrigued, Greenlee presses on, determined to find out what Kendall means. Kendall sidesteps the question by reminding Greenlee that she will do anything and say anything to get what she wants - and right now, she wants to be alone. Greenlee tells her that she can take a hint, but will be around if Kendall changes her mind. Kendall makes note of it, and Greenlee leaves.\n\nIn their room across the hall, Jack grabs a present for Erica, saying that it can't wait until tomorrow. Gleeful, she sits on the bed with Jack and opens the box. Inside is a French Maid uniform, and they briefly reflect back to the last time she wore something like that for him. She then tells a disappointed Jack that they don't have a need for things like costumes and games anymore. The disappointment doesn't last for long as she follows by saying that they don't need clothes at all. After they make love, Erica tells Jack that she wants him to leave. Jack is slightly taken aback, but Erica stands her ground - she doesn't want to take the chance that they will jinx their future. He gets dressed, tells her that he will meet her at the altar tomorrow, and she agrees that she will show up. They exchange \"I love you\"s and Jack heads out the door.\n\nA short time later, Kendall walks out on the beach, alone and searching for something. Greenlee appears from the shadows, and with a smile, she realizes that by locking Zach in the shed, she thwarted their plans.\n\nThe next morning, Erica awakens to a bright, sunny day and opens the shades to her room. She crosses the room, and sees a note for her that had been slid under the door. The note is from Jack, and he tells her that while he didn't get to start this day with her, that would never happen again. Just as she finishes reading the note, there is a knock at the door, and she knows instinctively that it is her groom. He promises to do whatever he needs to do if only she would open the door and let him in. She tells him that although it's silly to let superstition stop her from opening the door, she's letting it do just that.\n\nAs Kendall and Greenlee attempt to take in a little sun and relaxation before the wedding that afternoon, Kendall notes that her soon-to-be sister is a little too happy for the morning. Greenlee blows off Kendall's bad mood and heads for the spa, expecting Kendall to follow. She looks back to see Kendall about to open the pool supplies room where she locked Zach, and inexplicably tries to stop her.\n\nMay 23, 2005- J.R. blackmailed Amanda to get her to agree to sleep with Jamie and ruin his brother's relationship with Babe. Amanda realized it kills J.R. that Jamie could make Babe happy, when he couldn't. Amanda and J.R. struck a deal for room, board, tuition and a grand a week, but she wanted him as a bonus.\n\nAs Jamie assured Babe he was happy living with her where they are, the roof fell in literally! Jamie assured Babe as long as they're together, this is exactly where he wanted to be. Babe reminds Jamie how much easier his life could be if he accepted the terms of Phoebe's will.\n\nWhen Simone went to the penthouse, Ryan asked if she knew Greenlee is out of town? \"That's why I'm here, Ms. Torres told him. Simone admitted to Ryan that she had come because she was worried about his marriage. Simone questions the motive for Ryan's extravagance in purchasing a first anniversary gift for his wife. Ryan icily informs Simone that he and Greenlee are no longer interested in starting a family. Ryan was able to reassure Simone that his marriage would be fine, but thought of her words, along with Greenlee's and Kendall's, after she left.\n\nGreenlee struggles to keep Kendall from discovering that she has Zach locked in the resort's linen closet. When the pool manager opened the door to the storage room, Greenlee was surprised to find Zach was no longer trapped inside. Jack and Greenlee mended fences, and he agreed to stay out of her marriage. Jackson promises a grateful Greenlee he's going to try harder to cut her husband some slack from now on. Greenlee learned that Zach had checked out of the hotel resort. Bianca and Kendall spent quality time together, talking about the situation with Ethan and Zach, and about true love. Bianca prods her sister to give Ethan another chance to redeem himself but admits that Kendall was right to give her former flame an ultimatum.\n\nReggie offered his dad some words of wisdom on how to stay married to Erica Kane! ds to the joy and excitement of being her life partner. Greenlee happened upon Jack talking to Reggie about relationships, and told her father that was as good a description of marriage as she's ever heard. Jack said he cannot tell his family how much it meant to him that they're here, when he finally married Erica Kane. After the Kane women tradition, Kendall said her mother's groom is waiting; Erica smiled, \"Oh, just try to stop me! The wedding began as the family gathered under the magnificent old Banyan tree.\n\nTuesday, May 24, 2005 THE WEDDING BEGINS- Jack sees his bride, and they walk toward each other under the beautiful arches and columns of the hotel. Their children join them, and Jack takes Erica's hand. He leads her to the magnificent old Banyan tree, their family following close behind. Bianca puts Miranda into a playpen set up by the wedding party, and the wedding begins. The minister welcomes Erica, Jackson, and their beautiful families. They've come here to this special place for a special purpose, to join man and woman in the most exalted of bonds, and to join their families, two into one, a profound act of love, faith and courage. If anyone knows why this man and woman should not be joined, speak now. Everyone seems to hold their breath until Reggie says that part isn't necessary.\n\nWhen Greenlee holds up her hand, Kendall practically tackles her, Bianca glares at her, and Reggie tells Green Pea not to even think about it, but Greenlee assures them it was just an itch, and she's better now, \"Sorry. The minister resumes, telling Jack and Erica when they spoke earlier, they said they felt like it was Kismet. They were drawn by the ancient beauty of the Banyan tree, how the tree grows out rather than up, how the branches shoot out new roots so they can find a haven in the soil, bringing strength to the tree. That's the family they create here today, new roots, new growth, one sheltering tree, \"Who gives this woman to this man? Bianca and Kendall beam as they say, \"We do. The minister asks, \"And who gives this man? Reggie, Lily and Greenlee are just as happy to reply, \"We do.\n\nReggie steps forward and compares them all to this tree thing, \"Now you're my parents, mother and father. That doesn't even begin to make sense, except it does. Jack isn't just his guardian, or some guy who checks over his homework, \"You're my dad! Does he know how good that makes him feel inside? And Erica, the classiest lady he's ever met, the scariest, too talk about fierce! But her heart, it's as big as the world. Where he comes from, you get used to not expecting too much, nothing good, at least. But the two of them together, they make him expect and make him believe, \"I love you guys.\n\nLily is next, saying she wanted to tell them the surface area and fluid volume of the average human heart, because the heart is supposed to be about love, even though it isn't very romantic and it's red, but she didn't have time to get that information, so Reggie said she could just tell them the information that's in her head, her favorite times with them both. Her dad helped her say her first word, \"He made me be not so different, but he never made me not be me, so that's a time I like very much. She tells Erica her favorite moment with her is different; it's when she ran from Adam Chandler's big house and got stuck by the side of the road. The red light flashed and it hurt her eyes and her head, and Erica told her to look at her blue wrap, and she did. Because of the light, it looked purple, and she really likes purple, \"I was afraid, and then I wasn't, because of you. Erica tells her, \"Oh, Lily, I love purple, and I love you. Lily tentatively holds out her hand, and Erica takes it.\n\nGreenlee tells her dad she found him too late, but since they're both overachievers, they crammed a lot into a short time. But, that's somewhere else, away from this place. Here, under their tree, all there is is love, \"I love you. She tells Erica they've never been friends, but the way she loves the big guy next to her¦ Like Reggie says, fierce. She thanks her for loving her father, for making him crazy and cranky and way beyond happy. \"That you do that, in a way, makes you the best friend I'll ever have. And if you ever hurt him¦ Erica agrees, \"Understood. Kendall steps forward and tells her mother she loves her. Erica says she loves her, too, and Kendall says it's taken a long time for them to get to this place, love between them, and now she is so proud of them, and she's so proud that she's her mother. And Jack¦ She's so grateful he's accepted her as his daughter, and that's what makes this so¦ She's never had a father like him, never imagined she could have a father like him, to love and trust, and always be there for her, \"Thank you.\n\nBianca is last, and tells her mother she is Erica Kane. She's strong¦ Reggie says fierce, too, and they all laugh. Lily adds, \"Very pretty, and Kendall calls her amazing. Bianca goes on that she is her mother; even as a kid that blew her mind, that she came from her and had to live up to her. She has watched her conquer the world, and she's seen her lost in it, but she never gives up, not for long. As a kid, it terrified her that she could never measure up. Erica tearfully says she knows she is more than she ever could have hoped for! Bianca smiles it's okay, because somewhere between her childhood and today she found herself, the part of her that's like her mother, the part of her that isn't, and Erica found her, too. Fighting for what really matters, love and familyshe never gave up until she had it all, and look at her now! She has the world.\n\nShe tells Jack she's always loved him as her uncle, and since her dad died, he's been there, not just as a place keeper or substitute, but as her father in every way that counts, and now they're going to make it official, \"We're going to be a family, all of us. When Jack says she's trembling, Erica confesses she's not that fierce. It's been so long, they've come so close to this moment they could touch it, yet they always pulled away. Jack says ever since their crash landing in the desert, and Erica tells him he saved her life. \"And you ruined mine, Jack recalls, \"We'd fallen in love, but I couldn't have you, yet. Erica smiles they found they way to each other, and Jack notes they had to go all the way to Paris to do that. Erica remembers those beautiful violins, saying she still hears them sometimes in her dreams. \"My beautiful Corinne, Jack sighs, and Reggie asks, \"Do I even want to know? Together, Jack and Erica tell him, \"No!\n\nJack goes on that Paris was a dream, but reality got in the way. Erica agrees they were friends first, and then lovers, and then two people who couldn't find their way home to each other. Jack agrees there were other faces and other mates, \"And still, you. Erica agrees, \"Always you. Jack sighs she made him crazy. \"Yes was \"No, \"Maybe was \"Never, and \"Right was \"Wrong, but Erica says \"Wrong was never wrong enough to keep them apart, \"You waited for me. Jack smiles she made it easy, and impossible! Erica remembers so many years and rings and broken promises, but she doesn't blame them for not having the courage before. How do you touch destiny? Jack agrees it's a solemn vow, unbreakable, and soul to soul. Erica tells him she will love him with all that she is, and Jack vows to love her and protect her until the end of time. Erica says he is her peace, and her possibility. Jack calls her his path and his answer; because of her, he can expect, and he believes. Erica smiles as she says when her world is red, he will turn it purple, and she won't do anything to make Greenlee come after her! She loves him, and vows to spend the rest of her life with him, to live all their dreams. She vows to speak, and to listen, to hear the voice of the father of their children, to set sail for the future with her husband, and no one jumps overboard. They chart their course together!\n\nJack vows to spend the rest of his life with her, to help her when she needs it, and step aside, way aside, when she doesn't. He vows to love, honor and respect their children's mother, \"I vow to make your life amazing, because you amaze me. Reggie steps forward with the rings, and Erica places Jack's on his finger, \"You are my husband, from this day until the day I die. Jack slips Erica's ring on, \"You are my wife, from this day till the day I die. Oh, but you're my heart for all eternity. The minister pronounces, \"Erica and Jackson, you are now husband and wife. The Kane family and the Montgomery family are now one. Erica is stunned when white doves are released amidst their family's cheers, and tells Jack he said he would never¦ Jack tells her this is the wedding to end all weddings, \"What wouldn't I do for you, Mrs. Montgomery? They share their first kiss as husband and wife.\n\nThe family strolls past the violinists, and Lily remarks that some Banyan trees have over a thousand roots. Reggie groans there's no way he signed up for 999 sisters! As they tease him, they come upon a group of reporters, asking if the Pine Valley wedding was a decoy? Was Oprah supposed to be her maid of honor? Someone asks if the 10th time's the charm and, to Jack, \"How does it feel to be the guy that gets to call Miss Kane Mrs.'? Jack replies with a kiss for his bride.\n\nBack in their suite, Erica protests they're waiting for them, and Jack asks who, the caterers? He's waited 17 years for this, so the caterers can cool their heels for a little bit, \"I love you so much, Mrs. Montgomery. Erica loves the sound of that. As Jack kisses her, Reggie comes in with Lily, who says they have their wedding present. Erica insists their just being there is more than they could have ever wanted, but Lily insists it's really pretty, and they wanted them to have it. Jack opens the large box and Erica gasps as he takes the framed art from the box. Lily explains it's their Kismet tree, \"Really, it's a charcoal sketch of the Banyan tree from the ceremony. Reggie agrees they kind of consider it their official family tree now.\n\nIt's funky, messy, and a little weird, but it's real, \"And that freaky little root down there? That's Green Pea! They all laugh, and Erica says it's beautiful; she and Jack thank them so much. Lily says she likes this tree, almost as much as she likes the tree at home. When she looks at it, she feels safe. She and Erica smile at each other, and Reggie calls that their official mother-daughter moment, right there. That's familythat's what he's talking about! Jack asks if that's a little pride he heard in his voice? Is that a little tear he sees right there? Reggie says yes, he did, and yes, he's proud, though he's not too sure about being outnumbered by the ladies! But the rest, he wanted for himself and for them, for all of them. And, since he got his way, they can consider him off their backs, but if they mess up. Jack agrees he has permission to whip them back into shape. Erica says he won't have to, \"You have your family. We all have our family. And, yes, this is what we are. Our Kane-Montgomery family is definitely funky, messy, and real, and it's here to stay.\n\nAs Kendall looks at the message light on the phone in her suite and wills it to blink, Greenlee bursts in and demands, \"Where is he? She knows Zach Slater is here, and she's hiding him! Kendall says she already told her, Zach is not here, and she is alone. Greenlee looks through the suite, in closets, behind doors and under the bed as she tells Kendall she saw them on the beach with the flower. She knows what they're up to! She would have said something, but didn't want to ruin the Wedding of the Century. But now, Erica and Jackson are married, and she's got Slater stashed somewhere. She knows, because she stashed him first in the pool house. Kendall asks if she's crazy? Is that why she freaked out when she tried to grab a towel? Greenlee calls that a nice cover, but she knows she knew. That's why she needled her outside that door; she knew Zach was in there because she already let him out already! He came here to get her to marry himwhy else would he be sneaking around? She's messed up and she's angry, and she's been there a lot, so let her help her, \"Let me stop you from making the kind of mistake that will bite you in the rear and never let go. Kendall sighs, other than her forgetting to lock the door, this is a mistake-free zone. She's going now to visit their newlywed couple, \"And if you decide to join us, let's at least pretend like we're friends.\n\nTHE HONEYMOON BEGINS. Jack proposes a toast to the woman he's waited for for so long, and kisses her to show how worth it it was. Music begins, and Jack leads Erica in the first dance. They look into each other's eyes as their family looks on and smiles. Bianca and Kendall dance with Miranda, and Reggie cuts in to dance with Erica. Lily happily twirls to the music, and Jack takes a turn on the dance floor with Greenlee. Later, Jack and Erica cut the wedding cake, and playfully dot the other's nose with frosting before kissing it off. Reggie and Greenlee have a dance, and they are all family, happy at last.\n\nBack in the suite, Erica asks if they should wait for Bianca? Kendall notes it evidently takes hours to pack baby gear, and Jack says she'll have to give her the update to Honeymoon 2005. Erica says they're going to take the yacht back up the coast, and stop at places like Charleston, their dad's hometown, and have sun and ocean and moonlight dinners on the deck. \"And you, Jack adds. He tells the family they know it's not Italy, but they'd like to make good on the invitation they extended to them all before their last wedding. Erica agrees they can all come, and Bianca and Miranda, too. It'll be their first real family vacation! Their children call that sweet and thank them, but no! Reggie asks if the word \"honeymoon means anything to them? Kendall notes that, on rare occasions, people have said her mother can be a little self-centered, and Greenlee tells Erica not to lose that, not now, \"No tag-alongs on vacation. Reggie's sure if Bianca was here, she'd say no, too, and Lily asks, \"How can you have flutters with us around? Erica laughs with Jack as she assures them they manage.\n\nJack asks if that's it, they can't convince them to come along? \"Gosh, I don't know, a kid-free, flutter-filled honeymoon? Hmm. Reggie laughs it takes him a little while, but he catches on. Erica asks how they will ever fill their time, and Jack laughs and kisses her as he says he has some notions about that. Erica realizes that means this is goodbye. Jack asks if he's okay with this watching his sister and all? Greenlee and Myrtle will stop by, but he's in charge. Reggie agrees he's got this big brother thing down; he's got Lily and all his new sisters covered. He should just remember \"honeymoon!\n\nErica asks Kendall to please promise her she won't do anything extreme, no life-altering decisions that include Zach. Kendall tells her mother to focus! She has an amazing new husband all to herself on a yacht, \"I mean, how great it is to be you? Erica agrees it's pretty great, and hugs her daughter.\n\nLily tells Jack if they wait a few minutes, she can print out sea conditions and weather for coastal water travel. Jack agrees he'd like that, and Lily tells him, \"And, if you want, I can hug you goodbye. Jack agrees he'd like that very much, and stands still while Lily presses herself to him. He turns to Greenlee and hugs her; he thanks her so much for everything, and when they get back, they'll sit down and talk. Kendall says that's enoughthe newlyweds should shove off already! Erica says not just yet, \"I have one big surprise left.\n\nThe family watches as the crew of the yacht waves to them, and Erica tells Jack this wedding, this day, was all so sudden. Bianca objects, but Erica means it. She was kidnapped, she had no fair warning, no time to pack a bag or pick up Jack's wedding gift from the engraver. Jack assures her that her hand in marriage is gift enough. Erica says she wanted to get him something to say thank you for being so patient, for accepting and understanding her, and for throwing her over his shoulder when she gets her own way! So, she found a little bauble. When she gestures at the yacht, the crew drops the \"Just Married sign on the back to reveal the new name of the boat, \"At Last. Jack is speechless, and Reggie tells his dad, \"J, she just got you a boat, dude! It's your boat. Erica tells Jack he fixed them when they were broken, but Bianca says not broken, just a little bent. Erica tells them if they ever get bent ever again, they have a reminder of how they belong together, \"And a place to stash each other until the mood passes again. Jack asks if that means, if they ever try to leave each other, it's anchors away and lock the cabin door? Erica asks what he thinks; he kisses her to show her.\n\nLily checks out the yacht and says the conditions are right for departure, but they might need light sweaters onboard. \"Aye-aye, Jack salutes his daughter, and asks Erica, \"Shall we? She asks for just a moment, and goes to Bianca. They both agree not to cry, and Erica tells Miranda not to grow up too fast before she sees her again. Before long, she'll be borrowing her shoes, and she's going to bring her a Scarlett O'Hara doll from Charleston! Bianca groans that's great, just the role model she wants for her daughter! Erica asks if she has a better one in mind? Bianca says, as a matter of fact, she does. She tells her to have a wonderful honeymoon, \"Don't make Uncle Jack lock you up again. Erica sighs Paris is so beautiful; she's sure she can't wait to get back. Bianca promises she'll get back to visit as soon as she can, and both hold back tears as they kiss goodbye. \"I love you, Bianca tells her, and Erica agrees, \"I love you so much. Jack comes up and says he's ready for the \"At Last. A final goodbye, and the honeymooners board the yacht. They wave and blow kisses as the boat leaves the dock, and Greenlee calls out,\" Can I borrow your red Gucci while you're gone? I'll take that as a yes!\n\nWednesday, May 25, 2005- Still on the Boca Raton resort, Bianca bid a tearful goodbye to her family before sailing off to return to Paris. Zach stood by the bed and asked, \"Kendall? Greenlee jumped up from under the covers and grabbed him as she exclaimed, \"Gotcha! Greenlee urged Zach to end his war with Ethan before he scarred his son for life. Greenlee vowed to do whatever it takes to stop Zach from wrecking Kendall's life; he said she was welcome to try.\n\nEthan told Kendall he had done as she asked, and signed a document relinquishing his share of Cambias to Zach. Ethan asked if she wanted her wedding big or small? Here, or in Pine Valley? He votes for here, tonight! When Kendall asked what he's saying, Ethan got down on one knee and told her, \"Marry me. Ethan was stunned when Zach told him that he and Kendall were already married; he ripped up the document and told Kendall he was done with her.\n\nGreenlee told Kendall she had been wrong, that Ethan really must love her, but Kendall said it was too late; Zach had warned her that Ethan could forgive her for sleeping with J.R., but never for marrying his father. Zach offered his son an even swap, his share of Cambias for Kendall; it's the deal of a lifetime if he's smart enough to take it. Kendall lost her temper with Greenlee and let slip that her marriage wasn't all she thought it was; Greenlee asked, \"What's about to pop into my marriage?\n\nJ.R. and Amanda staged an argument for Babe and Jamie's sake, the object being to make them believe J.R. had thrown Miss Dillon out of the mansion. Amanda slapped J.R. when he made a reference to her psycho mommy. After their successful con, J.R. and Amanda had sex before she returned to Jamie's for Phase Two of the plan. Amanda told Jamie that J.R. had said she could stay, but threatened to send her to prison for grand theft if she remained friendly with him and Babe. J.R. taunted Babe, saying he knew about the plane ticket to Mexico, and would squash any chance Jamie had of getting into the university there; Babe told him nothing he could do would break her and Jamie up. When Jamie told Amanda he knew where her new home would be, she said she knew she had come to the right place.\n\n**The End**"
