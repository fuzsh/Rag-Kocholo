        "text": "Longtime ABC Daytime fans were tickled pink when it was announced earlier this month that ALL MY CHILDREN fan favorite Walt Willey would be bringing his Pine Valley alter ego, Jackson Montgomery, over to GENERAL HOSPITAL’s Port Charles for a visit. While the original casting news stated that Willey’s stint would begin in July, the actor divulged a few details about his crossover on social media!\n\nOn June 9, after he had completed his story arc, Willey gave his Twitter followers an update. “Just returned from ‘Port Charles,’ so to speak, and Jackson being a part of the GH cast,” he posted. “Such fun! Color me honored and grateful!”\n\nThe beloved actor went on to share that he felt incredibly welcomed by the cast and crew during his time on the set. “Thanks to all at GH!”\n\nWilley’s time on daytime dates back to 1983, when he appeared as a guard on THE EDGE OF NIGHT. He had juicier roles on ANOTHER WORLD (as Jim LaRusso), RYAN’S HOPE (as Joe Novack), and AS THE WORLD TURNS (as Jacoby) before finding a home in Pine Valley when he joined the AMC cast in 1987 as Jackson Montgomery — who would go on to become one of Erica Kane’s many husbands. Willey and Jackson were an integral part of the fabric of AMC right up until the soap’s final episode in 2011, and he even crossed over to sister soap THE CITY, playing Jackson for a handful of episodes on that ABC soap in 1996.\n\nStoryline details have not been released surrounding what brings Jackson to Port Charles. But considering that he’s a lawyer, it’s a pretty good bet that he may be involved in the SEC case pending against Drew and Carly. If he is in fact involved in that storyline, it would reunite Willey with pal Cameron Mathison (Drew), who played Ryan Lavery on AMC, and possibly even with Michael E. Knight (Martin; formerly AMC’s Tad) or James Patrick Stuart (Valentin; once AMC’s evil Will). Perhaps Jackson will even cross paths with Finola Hughes’ Anna, who lived in Pine Valley for a few years,\n\nAlthough Willey didn’t share anything about who he worked with during his story arc, he did give his followers a heads-up about when they can expect to see him on the soap!\n\n“Waiting for confirmation on air dates and will get those to you ASAP. But I’d keep the week of July 10 open!” he teased.\n\nKeep checking back with SoapsInDepth.com for further updates on Willey’s upcoming GH appearance!"
