        "text": "PondelWilkinson clients Mistic and Rentrak recently received top honors at this year’s PRSA-LA PRism awards.\n\nA client since 2013, electronic cigarettes brand Mistic® was recognized with the 2014 PRism Award for news release writing for its 2014 American E-Cigarette Etiquette Survey. Earlier this year, PR Week did a feature highlighting PondelWilkinson’s work on Mistic’s IndyCar campaign.\n\n“This year’s award represents the second time this year that the Mistic team has been recognized by the PR industry,” said Todd Millard, Mistic co-founder and COO. “Not coincidentally, George Medici and the team at PondelWilkinson have been a key partner in working with our leadership to develop and implement Mistic’s strategic PR program, which has helped us in our on-going efforts to expand awareness of our company and products.”\n\nRentrak (NASDAQ:RENT), the entertainment and marketing industries’ premier provider of worldwide consumer viewership information, received the 2014 PRism Award of Excellence for Annual Report – Corporate. The award was especially gratifying for the PondelWilkinson account team, who have worked with Rentrak for more than six years.\n\n“It was a great honor to work with Rentrak’s talented marketing team on this year’s annual report,” said Laurie Berman, managing director for PondelWilkinson. “I enjoyed collaborating with the team to develop messaging that complemented the original report design they created in-house. Working together, we created an annual report that not only was visually impactful, but meaningfully communicated Rentrak’s corporate progress and achievements to its stakeholders.”\n\nCongratulations to all of this year’s PRSA PRism winners!\n\n— E.E.
