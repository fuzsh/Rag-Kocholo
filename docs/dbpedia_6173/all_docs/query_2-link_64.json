        "text": "Today, the advertising community is more reliant on consumer and audience marketing data than ever before. Without such data, media and marketing decisions cannot be made effectively or efficiently.\n\nSurprisingly, many prominent research companies are now facing serious uncertainty in terms of both ownership and operation. As the patterns of media consumption are evolving rapidly, there are pressures for research companies to keep up, and even try to get ahead of the game for once. As time and tide wait for no man, so too with the four major audience measurement players over just the past few months: Nielsen, Kantar Media, Comscore and MRI.\n\nNielsen\n\nWith the Network TV upfront presentations completed, over $20 billion of advertising will be negotiated from demographic viewing data supplied by Nielsen Media Research.\n\nBesides TV ratings (Nielsen’s “Watch” division), Nielsen is among the world’s largest research companies providing consumer “shopping” data on a broad spectrum of brands and products found in “brick and mortar” stores (Nielsen's “Buy” division). Nielsen provides information globally, nationally and locally. However, Nielsen is facing serious competition and substantial changes in viewer and consumer behavior. With a new CEO in David Kenny and facing grave measurement challenges in both divisions, Nielsen has a market capitalization of $9.3 billion and $8.4 billion in total debt.\n\nAs a result, Nielsen has been looking into the possibility of selling itself for around $10 billion to some deep-pocketed buyout firms. Other scenarios for Nielsen include creating a standalone public company, breaking up Nielsen into several divisions or selling one of its two divisions. There have been several private equity firms looking into acquiring Nielsen (a major private equity firm already owns a large stake of the company). At the end of January 2019, Blackstone was reportedly planning to partner on a bid; Bain, KKR and TPG are also said to be in the mix.\n\nKantar\n\nKantar, a WPP subsidiary, is a data, insights and consulting company that offers potential clients social media monitoring, ad effectiveness studies, public opinion research, consumer and shopper behavior data and competitive ad spending reports. Kantar subsidiaries include Kantar Millward Brown, Kantar TNS and Lightspeed. In November 2018, the new CEO of WPP, Mark Read (who replaced Sir Martin Sorrell), announced a turnaround strategy for the holding company, saying they would sell Kantar Media. WPP, the world’s largest advertising group, plans to keep a minority ownership of up to 40% while seeking a financial and strategic partner that would gain control. Kantar has been underperforming financially.\n\nAs is the case with Nielsen, there are reportedly several private equity bidders for Kantar, including Bain Capital, Apollo, Platinum and Vista Equity Partners. There was even some talk of a Nielsen-Kantar merger, but talks have broken down. Last fall, Kantar was valued at $3-4 billion. Similar to Nielsen, there are some parts of Kantar that are more valuable than others. A sale could be announced by the end of June 2019.\n\nComscore\n\nWPP also has a minority-owner stake in Comscore. In recent years, it has become a formidable competitor to Nielsen in national cross-platform audience measurement and local TV ratings. Even so, Comscore has been experiencing some recent instability and shake-ups in management. At the end of March 2019, Comscore’s top two executives, CEO Bryan Wiener and President Sarah Hofstetter, abruptly, unexpectedly resigned on the same day. Wiener cited “irreconcilable differences with the board over how to execute the company’s strategy.” Hofstetter resigned in a show of support. Both had been in their respective positions for less than one year. Comscore quickly named an interim CEO and added new board members. At the end of May 2019, Comscore lost another high-profile executive when Chief Operating Officer Kathryn Bachmann announced her resignation less than two months after joining the company.\n\nThis is not the first time Comscore has faced corporate instability. In the aftermath of its acquisition of Rentrak, Comscore, in February 2017, was delisted by the Nasdaq stock exchange. The delisting came as a result of Comscore’s missing a deadline to provide the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) with an internal audit. Comscore was relisted by Nasdaq in June 2018.\n\nMRI\n\nIn February 2019, a joint venture between MRI and Simmons was announced. For decades, the two rivals had competed in providing their clients with media (especially magazines and newspapers) and consumer insights.\n\nThe joint venture is called MRI-Simmons. MRI is a part of GfK (which is owned by KKR, a private equity firm) and will be the co-owner along with the SymphonyAI Group, the parent company of Simmons. GfK is the majority partner. The joint venture will continue to provide consumer and media insights to their clientele of advertisers, agencies and media companies. One reason given for the joint venture is reportedly that combined it will have greater resources than either one had as a separate entity. This will provide their clients with new products as well as better, faster and more robust insights.\n\nDavid Tice, a media research consultant and author of the TiceVision blog, expects the joint venture will focus on several areas including local market measurement, and will be able to integrate more data sets which they can sell to clients. Tice also notes that since the merger name and branding does not involve either parent company, it could mean the MRI-Simmons joint venture could eventually be spun-off to the benefit of GfK and SymphonyAI.\n\nConsumer behavior has been evolving rapidly, making it difficult for well-established and large media companies to keep up their clients’ needs. There are many smaller data-centric companies that are providing the media and advertising industry with insights on niche products and services. Additionally, the ability to provide a more accurate picture of consumer behavior and the media landscape is more difficult as both continue to fragment.\n\nFinal Analysis\n\nIn the final analysis, one media research veteran says, “All this talk of dollars and cents makes no sense, if broadcasters and advertisers are seeking better audience and consumer measurement. And they most certainly will not find what they are looking for on Wall Street!” said Nicholas P. Schiavone, former Chief Research Officer of the NBC TV Networks and now President of the strategic consulting firm that bears his name. Schiavone insists, “Senior management in marketing, advertising and media fail to consider the crucial difference between ‘measurement’ and ’data.’ While media and marketing firms boast about their data scientists, as do media and marketing research firms, few, if any, ask the ‘$64,000 Question’: Is the data being analyzed fit for use in the first place?”\n\nSchiavone challenges the conventional wisdom that lays the blame for this “mess” at the footsteps of media and brand fragmentation. Schiavone says, “Media aren’t fragmenting as much as they are ‘complexifying.’ The same is true of consumer behavior. In the meantime, our measurement systems are anachronistic, if not simplistic. At best, our business question maybe right, but our answers, and ’answering machines’) are too often wrong and outdated by at least 25 years.”\n\nGoing forward, Schiavone asserts that “before data scientists get their hands on the numbers and begin to analyze and aggregate them, measurement scientists will need to verify that the data are accurate -- or even valid -- reliable -- or even stable -- and useful. These are not terms of art, but critical terms of science that can be quantified before being applied to mission critical decisions. Cash flow, profit analysis and private equity will not bail out the research industry and its clients from their collective intellectual bankruptcy.”\n\nA number of private equity firms have a reputation for stripping the assets of their acquisitions. This comes at a time when more assets are going to be needed for media research companies to keep up with accurately measuring consumer activities.\n\nNonetheless, Bill Harvey, a well-known media research innovator, entrepreneur and consultant, is optimistic, saying, “The more visionary private equity firms will leaven together the core of these traditional market research operations with the right combination of big data and artificial intelligence, to reinvent more successful research companies that will make everybody more successful. Some of the people let out of jobs by all this will get together and start new research companies that may further fragment market research.”\n\nConclusion\n\nClearly, today’s research companies have customers/clients, especially for their syndicated research products and services. Like the value of a dollar, which is secured by the gold in Fort Knox, one might well ask what is a client’s faith in Nielsen television ratings and retail shares secured by?\n\nSchiavone said, “The answer would seem to be only one thing … methodology.” In addition to his work within NBC, Schiavone served for a decade as Chairman of CONTAM (Committee on Nationwide Television Audience Measurement). CONTAM was a Congressionally-mandated, self-regulatory TV industry body composed of the four major television networks: ABC, CBS, FOX and NBC. Upon Nielsen’s (and AGB’s) introduction of the People Meter in 1987 to measure the U.S. television audience, CONTAM launched a $2 million “audit” of the new methodology. Before the study could be completed, AGB suspended U.S. TV operations, citing unexpected costs; Nielsen had once again maintained its near-monopoly status.\n\nNonetheless, the CONTAM study continued for approximately two years and, in the end, delivered a report of nearly 1,000 pages. In Schiavone’s judgment, “Nielsen’s sins were sins of omission, not so much commission. Simply stated, Nielsen was found to lack:\n\nA commitment to defined procedures and quality control\n\nA commitment to methodological research\n\nA commitment to client communication\n\nWithout these three ingredients, research companies are doomed to both fiduciary and financial failure. Without these three ingredients there can be no research quality and no methodological transformation."
