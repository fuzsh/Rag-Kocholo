        "text": "TV’s Top 30 Group Owners\n\nRank Group 2014 Rev. (000) 1 Fox $1,745,100 2 CBS $1,614,850 3 Sinclair $1,469,160 4 Gannett $1,420,950 5 Comcast/NBCU $1,364,875 6 Tribune $1,330,575 7 ABC/Disney $1,132,450 8 Media General $989,500 9 Hearst $834,450 10 Univision $752,350 11 Raycom $685,175 12 Scripps $682,175 13 Nexstar $576,365 14 Cox Media $571,600 15 Gray $471,600 16 Meredith $441,350 17 Graham $279,950 18 Sunbeam $220,800 19 Entravision $138,680 20 Cordillera $133,575 21 Hubbard $131,550 22 Quincy $126,050 23 Ion Media $95,300 24 Schurz $95,300 25 Weigel $88,825 26 Dispatch $83,300 27 Capitol $80,750 28 Griffin $76,775 29 Berkshire Hathaway $72,000 30 News-Press & Gazette $70,580\n\nThe rankings are based on advertising estimates alone, and do not include other revenue from retransmission consent, websites and other digital ventures.\n\nAlso, although the estimates are for 2014, the station groups are credited for revenue for all stations they own and operate as well as for any stations they announced they are acquiring between May 22, 2014, when the last Top 30 was posted, and April 30, even if the deals have not closed.\n\nLooking ahead to next year, it’s likely there could be some movement based on increased revenue generated by groups with stations in areas with strong political spending.\n\nThe number of stations may change next year following the FCC’s scheduled spectrum auction, says Mark Fratrik, BIA/Kelsey SVP and chief economist. “But this year I don’t see many changes given the constraints of the FCC’s local ownership rules, and that’s not changing any time soon. Many of these groups are constrained from growing any bigger — both on a local level and [in terms of] national reach.”\n\nThe auction, Fratrick says, may appeal to some of the smaller groups below the TVN Top 30 that may decide to opt out.\n\n“There are a lot of people out there looking to buy, pick up a few markets here and there,” Fratrik says.\n\nBIA/Kelsey, an investment and research firm based in Chantilly, Va., tracks station group ownership and uses information from individual stations and markets, in addition to historical data, to generate its station and market ad revenue estimates. It checks its estimates against whatever public information is available, Fratrik says.\n\nBIA/Kelsey ranks Mission Broadcasting and stations owned by Stephen Mumblow and Cunningham Broadcasting as distinct groups with distinct ownership. But because they function essentially as subsidiaries of Sinclair, TVNewsCheck lumps their revenues together. The same holds true for Gannett, which includes the revenue of Sander Media; Tribune, which includes the revenue of Dreamcatcher Broadcasting; and Nexstar, which includes the revenue of Mission Broadcasting.\n\nThe group station coverage figures and numbers of stations/markets were also provided by BIA/Kelsey. (Editor’s note: The coverage numbers for some groups were incorrectly reported when this story was originally posted. They have been updated.) The number of stations includes full-power and low-power stations.\n\n1. FOX TELEVISION STATIONS\n\nNew York\n\n2014 Revenue: $1.7 billion\n\nStations: 28 in 17 markets\n\nCoverage: 37.2%\n\nOwnership: 21st Century Fox (NASDAQ: FOXA)\n\nKey Executives: Rupert Murdoch, chairman-CEO, 21st Century Fox; Chase Carey, president-COO, 21st Century Fox; James Murcoch, co-COO, 21st Century Fox; Roger Ailes, chairman-CEO, Fox News/chairman, Fox Television Stations; Gary Newman, chairman-CEO, Fox Television Group; Dana Walden, chairman-CEO, Fox Television Group; Jack Abernethy, CEO, Fox Television Stations; Dennis Swanson, president, station operations, Fox Television Stations.\n\nWhat’s Up: Fox Television Stations CEO Jack Abernethy has long made clear the company’s desire to own stations in top markets with NFC teams to take full advantage of the Fox network’s rights to broadcast NFC games every Sunday. So last September, Fox told Tribune that it was terminating its affiliation for KCPQ Seattle and offered to swap its MNT affiliate in Chicago, WPWR, for KCPQ. Then, at the beginning of October, Fox announced it was buying KBCB in the Seattle suburb of Bellingham, Wash. But in a surprise move, on Oct. 17, the two announced a new multi-year extension of the Fox affiliation for KCPQ through July 2018, which is concurrent with the timing of seven other Tribune Broadcasting Fox affiliation agreements.\n\nJoseph Dorrego, who was VP of investor relations for 21st Century Fox, became Fox Television Stations’ CFO-SVP in February. He replaced Betsy Swanson, who retired after 30 years with the group.\n\n2.

The multicast network debuted May 25 with partner Weigel Broadcasting (Top 30 group No. 25) handling Decades’ programming and distribution to other station groups.\n\nLast December, the station group agreed to provide local news, weather and entertainment content from CBS O&Os to Curb’s Taxi TV network of taxis and for-hire vehicles.\n\n3.

Marks, VP/co-COO, Sinclair Television Group; Stephen J. Pruett, VP/co-COO, Sinclair Television Group\n\nWhat’s Up: Sinclair continues to aggressively promote the adoption of a next-generation TV standard, ATSC 3.0, that would let TV stations deliver their over-the-air signals directly to mobile devices. According to Sinclair CEO David Smith, without that ability, broadcasters will lose to cable and telcos and become “essentially a three-legged dog in a four-legged dog, fast-track world.”\n\nTo celebrate its 20 years as a publicly-traded company, Sinclair execs will ring the Nasdaq stock market closing bell on June 5 at 4 p.m. ET.\n\n4.

Gannett is in the process of creating two publicly traded companies: one exclusively focused on its broadcasting and digital businesses, and the other on its publishing business and affiliated digital assets. Tegna will trade on the New York Stock Exchange under the ticker symbol TGNA.\n\nAs it moves to separate broadcast and publishing operations, Gannett is actively exploring development of its own broadcast programming, CEO Gracia Martore said during a February earnings conference call. And Dave Lougee, president of Gannett Broadcasting, added that the company is looking at not only home-grown programming, but also cooperative ventures with other broadcasters.\n\n5.
