To the extent required by Section 162(m) of the Code, shares subject to Options which are canceled continue to be counted against the Award Limit and if, after grant of an Option, the price of shares subject to such Option is reduced, the transaction is treated as a cancellation of the Option and a grant of a new Option and both the Option deemed to be canceled and the Option deemed to be granted are counted against the Award Limit. 2.2 ADD-BACK OF OPTIONS AND OTHER RIGHTS. If any Option, or other right to acquire shares of Common Stock under any other award under this Plan, expires or is canceled without having been fully exercised, or is exercised in whole or in part for cash as permitted by this Plan, the number of shares subject to such Option or other right but as to which such Option or other right was not exercised prior to its expiration, cancellation or exercise may again be optioned, granted or awarded hereunder, subject to the limitations of Section 2.1.

Shares of Common Stock which are delivered by the Optionee or Grantee or withheld by the Company upon the exercise of any Option or other award under this Plan, in payment of the exercise price thereof, may again be optioned, granted or awarded hereunder, subject to the limitations of Section 2.1. If any share of Restricted Stock is forfeited by the Grantee or repurchased by the Company pursuant to Section 6.6 hereof, such share may again be optioned, granted or awarded hereunder, subject to the limitations of Section 2.1. Notwithstanding the provisions of this Section 2.2, no shares of Common Stock may again be optioned, granted or awarded if such action would cause an Incentive Stock Option to fail to qualify as an incentive stock option under Section 422 of the Code. ARTICLE III. GRANTING OF OPTIONS 3.1 ELIGIBILITY. Any Employee or consultant selected by the Committee pursuant to Section 3.4(a)(i) shall be eligible to be granted an Option. Each Independent Director of the Company shall be eligible to be granted Options at the times and in the manner set forth in Section 3.4(d). 3.2 DISQUALIFICATION FOR STOCK OWNERSHIP. No person may be granted an Incentive Stock Option under this Plan if such person, at the time the Incentive Stock Option is granted, owns stock possessing more than ten percent (10%) of the total combined voting power of all classes of stock of the Company or any then existing Subsidiary or parent corporation (within the meaning of Section 422 of the Code) unless such Incentive Stock Option conforms to the applicable provisions of Section 422 of the Code. 3.3 QUALIFICATION OF INCENTIVE STOCK OPTIONS. No Incentive Stock Option shall be granted to any person who is not an Employee. 3.4 GRANTING OF OPTIONS 6 <PAGE> (a) The Committee shall from time to time, in its absolute discretion, and subject to applicable limitations of this Plan: (i) Select from among the Employees or consultants (including Employees or consultants who have previously received Options or other awards under this Plan) such of them as in its opinion should be granted Options; (ii) Subject to the Award Limit, determine the number of shares to be subject to such Options granted to the selected Employees or consultants; (iii) Subject to Section 3.3, determine whether such Options are to be Incentive Stock Options or Non-Qualified Stock Options and whether such Options are to qualify as performance-based compensation as described in Section 162(m)(4)(C) of the Code; and (iv) Determine the terms and conditions of such Options, consistent with this Plan; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that the terms and conditions of Options intended to qualify as performance-based compensation as described in Section 162(m)(4)(C) of the Code shall include, but not be limited to, such terms and conditions as may be necessary to meet the applicable provisions of Section 162(m) of the Code. (b) Upon the selection of an Employee or consultant to be granted an Option, the Committee shall instruct the Secretary of the Company to issue the Option and may impose such conditions on the grant of the Option as it deems appropriate. Without limiting the generality of the preceding sentence, the Committee may, in its discretion and on such terms as it deems appropriate, require as a condition on the grant of an Option to an Employee or consultant that the Employee or consultant surrender for cancellation some or all of the unexercised Options, awards of Restricted Stock or Deferred Stock, Performance Awards, Dividend Equivalents or Stock Payments or other rights which have been previously granted to him under this Plan or otherwise. An Option, the grant of which is conditioned upon such surrender, may have an option price lower (or higher) than the exercise price of such surrendered Option or other award, may cover the same (or a lesser or greater) number of shares as such surrendered Option or other award, may contain such other terms as the Committee deems appropriate, and shall be exercisable in accordance with its terms, without regard to the number of shares, price, exercise period or any other term or condition of such surrendered Option or other award. (c) Any Incentive Stock Option granted under this Plan may be modified by the Committee to disqualify such option from treatment as an \"incentive stock option\" under Section 422 of the Code. (d) (i) During the term of the Plan, each person who is an Independent Director shall automatically be granted an Option to purchase ten thousand (10,000) shares of Common Stock (subject to adjustment as provided in Section 9.3) on April 1st of each year; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that each such person who is Chairman of the Board or of any Board committee shall automatically be granted an Option to purchase an 7 <PAGE> additional two thousand five hundred (2,500) shares of Common Stock (subject to adjustment as provided in Section 9.3) on April 1st of each year. All the foregoing Option grants authorized by this Section 3.4(d)(i) are subject to stockholder approval of the Plan. (ii) The Board may from time to time, in its absolute discretion, and subject to applicable limitations of this Plan: (1) Determine whether, in its opinion, the Independent Directors (or any of them) should be granted Non-Qualified Stock Options in addition to the Options granted pursuant to Section 3.4(d)(i); (2) Subject to the Award Limit, determine the number of shares to be subject to such Non-Qualified Stock Options granted to selected Independent Directors; and (3) Determine the terms and conditions of such Non-Qualified Stock Options, consistent with this Plan. ARTICLE IV. TERMS OF OPTIONS 4.1 OPTION AGREEMENT. Each Option shall be evidenced by a written Stock Option Agreement, which shall be executed by the Optionee and an authorized officer of the Company and which shall contain such terms and conditions as the Committee (or the Board, in the case of Options granted to Independent Directors) shall determine, consistent with this Plan. Stock Option Agreements evidencing Options intended to qualify as performance-based compensation as described in Section 162(m)(4)(C) of the Code shall contain such terms and conditions as may be necessary to meet the applicable provisions of Section 162(m) of the Code. Stock Option Agreements evidencing Incentive Stock Options shall contain such terms and conditions as may be necessary to meet the applicable provisions of Section 422 of the Code. 4.2 OPTION PRICE. The price per share of the shares subject to each Option shall be set by the Committee; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that such price shall be no less than the par value of a share of Common Stock, unless otherwise permitted by applicable state law, and (i) in the case of Incentive Stock Options and Options intended to qualify as performance-based compensation as described in Section 162(m)(4)(C) of the Code, such price shall not be less than 100% of the Fair Market Value of a share of Common Stock on the date the Option is granted; (ii) in the case of Incentive Stock Options granted to an individual then owning (within the meaning of Section 424(d) of the Code) more than 10% of the total combined voting power of all classes of stock of the Company or any Subsidiary or parent corporation thereof (within the meaning of Section 422 of the Code) such price shall not be less than 110% of the Fair Market Value of a share of Common Stock on the date the Option is granted; and (iii) in the case of Options granted to Independent Directors pursuant to Section 3.4(d)(i), such price shall equal 100% of the Fair Market Value of a share of Common Stock on the date the Option is granted. 4.3 OPTION TERM. The term of an Option shall be set by the Committee in its discretion; provided, however, that, (i) in the case of Options granted to Independent Directors pursuant to Section 3.4(d)(i), the term shall be ten (10) years from the date the Option is granted, 8 <PAGE> without variation or acceleration hereunder, but subject to Section 5.6, and (ii) in the case of Incentive Stock Options, the term shall not be more then ten (10) years from the date the Incentive Stock Option is granted, or five (5) years from such date if the Incentive Stock Option is granted to an individual then owning (within the meaning of Section 424(d) of the Code) more than 10% of the total combined voting power of all classes of stock of the Company or any Subsidiary or parent corporation thereof (within the meaning of Section 422 of the Code). Except as limited by requirements of Section 422 of the Code and regulations and rulings thereunder applicable to Incentive Stock Options, the Committee may extend the term of any outstanding Option in connection with any Termination of Employment or Termination of Consultancy of the Optionee, or amend any other term or condition of such Option relating to such a termination. 4.4 OPTION VESTING. -------------- (a) The period during which the right to exercise an Option in whole or in part vests in the Optionee shall be set by the Committee (or the Board, in the case of Options granted to Independent Directors) and the Committee (or the Board, in the case of Options granted to Independent Directors) may determine that an Option may not be exercised in whole or in part for a specified period after it is granted; PROVIDED, ---------- HOWEVER, that, unless the Committee (or the Board, in the case of Options granted to Independent ------- Directors) otherwise provides in the terms of the Option or otherwise, no Option shall be exercisable by any Optionee who is then subject to Section 16 of the Exchange Act within the period ending six months and one day after the date the Option is granted. At any time after grant of an Option, the Committee (or the Board, in the case of Options granted to Independent Directors) may, in its sole and absolute discretion and subject to whatever terms and conditions it selects, accelerate the period during which an Option vests. (b) No portion of an Option which is unexercisable at Termination of Employment, Termination of Directorship or Termination of Consultancy, as applicable, shall thereafter become exercisable, except as may be otherwise provided by the Committee in the case of Options granted to Employees or consultants either in the Stock Option Agreement or by action of the Committee following the grant of the Option. (c) To the extent that the aggregate Fair Market Value of stock with respect to which \"incentive stock options\" (within the meaning of Section 422 of the Code, but without regard to Section 422(d) of the Code) are exercisable for the first time by an Optionee during any calendar year (under the Plan and all other incentive stock option plans of the Company and any Subsidiary) exceeds $100,000, such Options shall be treated as Non-Qualified Stock Options to the extent required by Section 422 of the Code. The rule set forth in the preceding sentence shall be applied by taking Options into account in the order in which they were granted. For purposes of this Section 4.4(c), the Fair Market Value of stock shall be determined as of the time the Option with respect to such stock is granted. 4.5 CONSIDERATION. In consideration of the granting of an Option, the Optionee shall agree, in the written Stock Option Agreement, to remain in the employ of (or to consult for 9 <PAGE> or to serve as an Independent Director of, as applicable) the Company or any Subsidiary for a period of at least one year (or such shorter period as may be fixed in the Stock Option Agreement or by action of the Committee following grant of the Option) after the Option is granted (or, in the case of an Independent Director, until the next annual meeting of stockholders of the Company). Nothing in this Plan or in any Stock Option Agreement hereunder shall confer upon any Optionee any right to continue in the employ of, or as a consultant for, the Company or any Subsidiary, or as a director of the Company, or shall interfere with or restrict in any way the rights of the Company and any Subsidiary, which are hereby expressly reserved, to discharge any Optionee at any time for any reason whatsoever, with or without good cause. ARTICLE V. EXERCISE OF OPTIONS 5.1 PARTIAL EXERCISE. An exercisable Option may be exercised in whole or in part. However, an Option shall not be exercisable with respect to fractional shares and the Committee (or the Board, in the case of Options granted to Independent Directors) may require that, by the terms of the Option, a partial exercise be with respect to a minimum number of shares. 5.2 MANNER OF EXERCISE. All or a portion of an exercisable Option shall be deemed exercised upon delivery of all of the following to the Secretary of the Company or his office: (a) A written notice complying with the applicable rules established by the Committee (or the Board, in the case of Options granted to Independent Directors) stating that the Option, or a portion thereof, is exercised. The notice shall be signed by the Optionee or other person then entitled to exercise the Option or such portion; (b) Such representations and documents as the Committee (or the Board, in the case of Options granted to Independent Directors), in its absolute discretion, deems necessary or advisable to effect compliance with all applicable provisions of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and any other federal or state securities laws or regulations. The Committee or Board may, in its absolute discretion, also take whatever additional actions it deems appropriate to effect such compliance including, without limitation, placing legends on share certificates and issuing stop-transfer notices to agents and registrars; (c) In the event that the Option shall be exercised pursuant to Section 9.1 by any person or persons other than the Optionee, appropriate proof of the right of such person or persons to exercise the Option; and (d) Full cash payment to the Secretary of the Company for the shares with respect to which the Option, or portion thereof, is exercised. However, the Committee (or the Board, in the case of Options granted to Independent Directors), may in its discretion (i) allow a delay in payment up to 30 days from the date the Option, or portion thereof, is exercised; (ii) allow payment, in whole or in part, through the delivery of shares of Common Stock owned by the Optionee, duly endorsed for transfer to the 10 <PAGE> Company with a Fair Market Value on the date of delivery equal to the aggregate exercise price of the Option or exercised portion thereof; (iii) allow payment, in whole or in part, through the surrender of shares of Common Stock then issuable upon exercise of the Option having a Fair Market Value on the date of Option exercise equal to the aggregate exercise price of the Option or exercised portion thereof; (iv) allow payment, in whole or in part, through the delivery of property of any kind which constitutes good and valuable consideration; (v) allow payment, in whole or in part, through the delivery of a promissory note (which may be without recourse or of limited recourse as determined by the Committee or the Board) bearing interest (at no less than such rate as shall then preclude the imputation of interest under the Code) and payable upon such terms as may be prescribed by the Committee or the Board; (vi) allow payment, in whole or in part, through the delivery of a notice that the Optionee has placed a market sell order with a broker with respect to shares of Common Stock then issuable upon exercise of the Option, and that the broker has been directed to pay a sufficient portion of the net proceeds of the sale to the Company in satisfaction of the Option exercise price; or (vii) allow payment through any combination of the consideration provided in the foregoing subparagraphs (ii), (iii), (iv), (v), and (vi). In the case of a promissory note, the Committee (or the Board, in the case of Options granted to Independent Directors) may also prescribe the form of such note and the security to be given for such note. The Option may not be exercised, however, by delivery of a promissory note or by a loan from the Company when or where such loan or other extension of credit is prohibited by law. 5.3 CONDITIONS TO ISSUANCE OF STOCK CERTIFICATES. The Company shall not be required to issue or deliver any certificate or certificates for shares of stock purchased upon the exercise of any Option or portion thereof prior to fulfillment of all of the following conditions: (a) The admission of such shares to listing on all stock exchanges on which such class of stock is then listed; (b) The completion of any registration or other qualification of such shares under any state or federal law, or under the rulings or regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission or any other governmental regulatory body which the Committee or Board shall, in its absolute discretion, deem necessary or advisable; (c) The obtaining of any approval or other clearance from any state or federal governmental agency which the Committee (or Board, in the case of Options granted to Independent Directors) shall, in its absolute discretion, determine to be necessary or advisable; (d) The lapse of such reasonable period of time following the exercise of the Option as the Committee (or Board, in the case of Options granted to Independent Directors) may establish from time to time for reasons of administrative convenience; and (e) The receipt by the Company of full payment for such shares, including payment of any applicable withholding tax. 11 <PAGE> 5.4 RIGHTS AS STOCKHOLDERS. The holders of Options shall not be, nor have any of the rights or privileges of, stockholders of the Company in respect of any shares purchasable upon the exercise of any part of an Option unless and until certificates representing such shares have been issued by the Company to such holders. 5.5 OWNERSHIP AND TRANSFER RESTRICTIONS. The Committee (or Board, in the case of Options granted to Independent Directors), in its absolute discretion, may impose such restrictions on the ownership and transferability of the shares purchasable upon the exercise of an Option as it deems appropriate. Any such restriction shall be set forth in the respective Stock Option Agreement and may be referred to on the certificates evidencing such shares. The Committee may require the Employee to give the Company prompt notice of any disposition of shares of Common Stock acquired by exercise of an Incentive Stock Option within (i) two years from the date of granting such Option to such Employee or (ii) one year after the transfer of such shares to such Employee. The Committee may direct that the certificates evidencing shares acquired by exercise of an Option refer to such requirement to give prompt notice of disposition. 5.6 LIMITATIONS ON EXERCISE OF OPTIONS GRANTED TO INDEPENDENT DIRECTORS.
