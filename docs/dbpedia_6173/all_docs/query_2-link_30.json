Most recently, he served as SVP and CFO of outdoor ad sales firm Olympus Media, prior to which he was COO of TV data and analytics company ADcom Information Services, where he worked directly with Rentrak's current CEO Bill Livek.\n\nBefore this, he was COO of computer games publisher GT Interactive Software, and held various management positions at Primerica Corp (formerly American Can Co). Chemerow is the current Non-executive Chairman of the Board of Playboy Enterprises. He has an MBA from the Amos Tuck School at Dartmouth College, and a BA from Dartmouth College.\n\n'I have known David for more than seven years, having worked closely with him in the audience measurement industry,' said Livek. 'He brings a wealth of operational and financial expertise, as well as a proven track record of enhancing shareholder value.'\n\nChemerow succeeds EVP and CFO Mark Thoenes, who is leaving the company to pursue new business opportunities. Livek thanked Thoenes for the role he had played in the company's growth and success over the past nine years.\n\nLast month, Rentrak appointed market research industry veterans Steven Walsh and Jeremy Gabor to support the commercialization of its cross-media platform. The previous month, the firm partnered with mobile TV service FLO TV to launch the mobile TV industry's 'first comprehensive viewership and ad impression reporting'.\n\nWeb site: www.rentrak.com .\n\nAll articles 2006-23 written and edited by Mel Crowther and/or Nick Thomas, 2024- by Nick Thomas, unless otherwise stated."
