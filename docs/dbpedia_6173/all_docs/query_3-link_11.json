        "text": "Hey everyone...\n\nI don't claim to be an expert on film finance. However, I have spent several years researching the subject. I wanted to share in this informational post some of the ways I have learned to raise money for your films.\n\nDisclaimer: The below is not to be considered legal or financial advice. I am not a professional in either of these fields.\n\nStudios\n\nThe classic, tried and true way of getting money for your film. Never-mind the fact that your odds of getting financing via this method is in the range of 1 in 1,000. Still, if your looking to raise money for a large motion picture ($5,000,000 plus), then this would be your best route to try first.\n\nAnother advantage of studio financing is that your film is guaranteed distribution (most of the time. However, there are setbacks. Namely, you will loose creative control over your film!\n\nPrivate Placement Investment\n\nUnder Regulation D of the US securities act, you can offer and sell and unlimited number and dollar value of shares in your partnership or corporation. However, you will need to keep the following in mind when relying on Regulation D, Rule 506:\n\nYou cannot use general public solicitation to market the stock.\n\nYou can only sell the stock to \"accredited investors\". According the SEC rules, an \"accredited Investor\" is any person or corporation that meets these requirements:\n\nAn Individual with a net worth of at least $1,000,000\n\nAn individual who has made $200,000 or more for the last two years\n\nA corporation worth at least $5,000,000 in total assets.\n\nAny investment bankers or brokers.\n\nYou legally CANNOT sell stock to your friends and family. While most filmmakers will ignore this, I suggest you don't. This is of course assuming your family or friends do not meet one of the qualifications above.\n\nPrivate investment can be a good choice for filmmakers looking to raise a very large sum of money for your picture, but it general helps if you have some bankable assets in place before trying to obtain a large sum of money this way. The investors you will be approaching under this rule are not stupid, and general will not invest less than $50,000 or more.\n\nCredit Cards / Self Finance\n\nThis one is obviously the easiest way to finance your film. Considering of course that you actually have or can get the money to do this. It general does not work for films costing more than $100,000....\n\nRegulation \"D\", Rule 504 Offerings / Small Corporate Offerings Registration (SCOR) - Direct Public Offering\n\nRegulation D, rule 504 of the US Securities act allows any corporation or limited liability company to raise no more than $1,000,000 in a 12 month period. So, what sets this apart from private placements? THE PUBLIC.\n\nBy taking advantage of Regulation D, rule 504, you can offer and sell the shares to the general public and you can use general advertising and solicitation. However, in order to sell to the public and use advertising, you must file a form called a \"SCOR\" offering, or form U-7 with EACH state that you want to offer or sell your securities in.\n\nIn general, the fee to submit the SCOR form to each state will be $100 to $1,500 or more per state. Most states work on a formula of \"1/20 of 1% of the offering\" or \"1/10 of 1% of the offering\". Prior to your offering, you MUST file \"Form D\" with the SEC. \"Form D\" is only an informational form, and does not require \"approval of the SEC\". You'll also need audited financial statements for offers of more than $500,000.\n\nThe main advantage to this setup is that you can sell shares of stock in your film to ANYONE who wants to buy them, and you can even advertise this offering. Your total cost to register Reg D / SCOR in all 50 states would probably be in the range of $12,000- $30,000.\n\nFor more detailed info on Regulation D offerings, see:\n\nhttp://www.sec.gov/answers/rule504.htm\n\nFor more information on SCOR filings, including a list of regional reviews and fees, see:\n\nhttp://sites.state.pa.us/PA_Exec/Securities/cer/crscor.html\n\nRegulation \"A\" Direct Public Offering\n\nRegulation A of the US Securities Code exempts any corporation or limited liability company from SEC registration for offerings that do not exceed $5,000,000 in any 12 month period. General Public Solicitation is allowed, and you can sell the shares to anyone. You also do not need audited financial records.\n\nHowever, you still need to register the securities in any states that you want to sell or market them in. Instead of using the SCOR form though, you would file Form A-1 with each state. You also have to submit form A-1 to the SEC for review. Regulation A is really more of a simplified registration than an exemption from SEC filings.\n\nKeep in mind that most states are more strict than the government. Most states will still require audited financial for offerings over $500,000 or $1,000,000 in some states. There are a few states that do not require audited financial for offerings up to $5,000,000 under regulation A. States filing fee's will be about the same as a SCOR offering above.\n\nThis is a good way to raise up to $5,000,000 for your film from the general public!\n\nKeep in mind that shares in your film, under regulation A, are freely triadable. This means that in all actuality, you could have your film listed on a national stock exchange or quoting system.\n\nRegulation S - Foreign Offerings\n\nThe SEC exempts corporations and limited liability companies from registering with the SEC for securities sold overseas, to non-US residents. Offering may be in any amount, and general public solicitation is allowed. You must, however, make it known that the stocks are not tradable in the united states.\n\nYou will also need to take care to make sure that your offering is in line with the securities commission of the country in which you are selling to. While the SEC does not require filings, you are still bound by anti-fraud laws of the US. The SEC will come after you if you rip someone off; foreign or not.\n\n=======================================================\n\nWell, there you have it. Sure, its rather lengthy, and most of you probably know about some of those methods. However, my goal was to make the SEC exemptions better known the filmmakers. :engel017:\n\nâ€‹\n\nHenry,\n\nMoonlight Media Home Entertainment will release around 24 - 36 films per year into the DVD market, as well as handle TV and Foreign sales for films which have those rights available. We are currently toying with the Idea of giving most films an LA / NY run before the DVD Premier as well, although this not yet finalized.\n\nWe will also be handling online streaming rights as well, for services such as iTunes and Amazon VOD. We are currently working out agreements with Rentrak, Walmart, Target, Best Buy, Kmart, Ingram, Baker & Taylor, Comcast VOD, Warner VOD, Charter One VOD, Amazon and other.\n\nMost of our titles will be carried in retail stores on a \"consignment\" basis, giving each title the maximum exposure possible. We also are looking to produce around 2 to 5 films per year, which may either be DVD Premiere or Television programs.\n\nIf your asking me what we would look for in a finnished film; that depends on the type of film it is. Most of our titles will be horror genre, released under the \"Dark Vision Pictures\" label. For these titles, we are not only looking for gore, but also good quality horror and thriller stories... Other films will be picked up based on how good the film is. Of course, having a known actor or some other bankable asset is a big help.\n\nIf you have any scripts that you have packaged and would like to pitch to us for production, we can also look into that as well. :furious3: Keep in mind that we are not yet operating, and are waiting for our IPO to clear in order to start full operations. We look to be in full-service by the end of the year.\n\nOn the other hand, if your asking me how best to raise money for your film, I would say that a Direct Public Offering under Regulation A and S is your best bet at getting funding. It's still not going to be easy though. Getting financing for a distribution company that plans to profit $2 million a year is easier than getting financing for a single film with no guarantee that it will even be seen, more less make money."
