        "text": "In an effort to expand its revenue-sharing video distribution program worldwide, Rentrak said Monday that it has formed Rentrak Intl. Corp. with partner Rentrak Japan.\n\nBased in Los Angeles, Herbert M. Fischer will serve as prexy and managing director of RIC, an equal partnership between Rentrak and Rentrak Japan.\n\nA privately held company in which Rentrak owns a 10% stake, Rentrak Japan is the pay-per-transaction licensee in that country. Through prior agreement, it also owns the rights to develop PPT in certain international markets.\n\nFischer most recently served as chairman of Mediacopy after serving as prexy since 1990. He joined the Rentrak board of directors in 1997 and will relinquish his board seat as he assumes his new responsibilities at RIC.\n\nHe also served as senior veep of sales and marketing at MGM/UA Home Video.\n\n“With Herb Fischer’s industry knowledge, his broad management experience and proven track record and his personal leadership qualities, we believe RIC has the potential to secure studio participation and attract joint-venture partners in a number of countries where we do not currently operate PPT,” said Rentrak chairman and CEO Ron Berger.\n\nThrough its PPT system, Rentrak is the world’s largest distributor of pre-recorded videocassettes on a revenue-sharing basis."
