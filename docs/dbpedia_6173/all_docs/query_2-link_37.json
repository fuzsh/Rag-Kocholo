        "text": "615 Music is a broadcast production music company based in Nashville, Tennessee. 615 Music composes television news music packages and custom image campaigns for many television networks around the world. 615 Music also operates out of Los Angeles. The name 615 Music comes from Nashville's Area Code, which is where the company is based. The company composed the last three image campaigns for NBC's Today morning news/entertainment program: \"Live for Today\", \"It's a New Day\", and \"Why I Love Today\". The \"Live for Today\" theme was nominated for an Emmy. 615 Music also has a production music library. The company, along with other composers of news music such as Gari Communications, have seen a surge in business since the third quarter of 2006. This is because licensing companies had raised the prices of licensing. In 2007, 615 Music signed a deal with Belo Corporation making them the exclusive provider of news music for the station group. The company's music has also been licensed for use in movie trailers. Their track \"Goth\" was used in the domestic trailer for the critically acclaimed 2007 action film, Live Free or Die Hard.\n\nACCESS CO., LTD., founded in April 1979 and incorporated in February 1984 in Tokyo, Japan, by Arakawa Toru and Kamada Tomihisa, is a company providing a variety of software for connected and mobile devices, such as mobile phones, PDAs, video game consoles and set top boxes. The company has gained wide recognition for its NetFront software series, which has been deployed in over 1 billion devices, representing over 2,000 models, as of the end of January 2011, and which has been used as a principal element of the widely successful i-mode data service of NTT DoCoMo in Japan. NetFront is also used by a large number of consumer electronic devices beyond mobile phones, such as the Sony PSP and the Amazon Kindle, both of which have their web browsers powered by NetFront. In addition, the NetFront Browser and related products are used on a wide variety of mobile phones, including those from Nokia, Samsung, LG Corp., Motorola, Sony Ericsson, and others. In September 2005, ACCESS acquired PalmSource, the owner of the Palm OS and BeOS."
