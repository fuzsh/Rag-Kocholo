        "text": "With the race for cross-screen audience measurement becoming more of a marathon than a sprint, under new CEO Bryan Wiener comScore has both feet in the game. Those would be its digital and television penetration and the granularity of its consumer behavior data. “The genesis behind the comScore-Rentrak merger was brilliant,” Wiener says in this […]\n\nMatching data sets for video advertising audience targeting is nothing new to comScore, particularly with Rentrak under its wing. Now with “100 percent market share” of all U.S. video-on-demand transactions, the company is encouraged by what partnerships like the nascent OpenAP consortium represent. Earlier this year, after Fox, Turner and Viacom announced the formation of […]\n\nIf bigger is better for companies like Charter Communications and Time Warner Cable, it’s also a boon to cross-platform measurement providers like comScore. Often overlooked by headlines heralding the continued merging of cable providers are the gains made in tracking consumer behavior and the ability to match it with product and service consumption—benefitting both programmers […]\n\nPALM SPRINGS — The merger of media measurement houses comScore and Rentrak just completed, heralding what the pair say is a new era in consumer tracking for brands and publishers. According to comScore, the new entity can now see 260 million desktop screens 160 million mobile phone screens 95 million tablet screens 40 million television […]\n\nFORT LAUDERDALE — Shareholders of comScore and Rentrak are due to vote on a merger of the two companies, via the former’s proposed acquisition of the latter, on Thursday, in a move that will be a big deal for the advertising and content measurement industry. The pair plan to combine to pool comScore’s online analytics nous with […]\n\nFORT LAUDERDALE — Fragmented content consumption has given rise to platforms that help advertisers and buyers aiming to put measurement back together. The only problem? They’re fragmented, too! Does any of this matter? Some marketers are becoming excited about the prospect of unifying ad measurements in to a single, holistic metric. But is that feasible? An entertaining panel convened at […]\n\nSo-called “addressable TV” promises to bring more-precisely-targeted advertisements to TV viewers via connected boxes and TV sets. And that is going to mean greater efficiencies, according to one ad tech exec. “Addressable TV is here,” says Rentrak CEO Bill Livek. “You have two national platforms at scale, with DISH and DirectTV. Then you have the […]\n\nSAN FRANCISCO — For David Algranti, it’s all or nothing. “For programmatic to scale to the levels we expect it to (in TV), it’s going to need to avail itself of all the TV (advertising) inventory, not some subsets of it,” says the product innovation SVP of video measurement supplier Rentrak. Algranti’s firm licenses return-path viewing […]\n\nSAN FRANCISCO — When are we going to see an industry in which a healthy slice of TV advertising is bought using so-called “programmatic” trading techniques? “For the major networks, it’s going to take a long time to eventually go over to this stock exchange process of being able to use data and being able […]\n\nSAN FRANCISCO — As TV reaches into the programmatic landscape, it will face challenges in areas like inventory, but opportunities in delivery and decisioning, says David Algranti, Senior VP TV Product Integration at measurement firm Rentrak during an interview with Beet.TV.
