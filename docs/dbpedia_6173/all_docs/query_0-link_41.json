You agree to notify Rentrak promptly if you have any reason to believe that any third party has unauthorized access to your login or password.

IN NO EVENT SHALL RENTRAK, ITS OFFICERS, DIRECTORS, EMPLOYEES OR SHAREHOLDERS BE LIABLE UNDER ANY THEORY, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO CONTRACT, BREACH OF WARRANTY, TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), OR PRODUCT LIABILITY, FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES (INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION ANY LOSS OF PROFITS OR DATA, BUSINESS INTERRUPTION, OR OTHER PECUNIARY LOSS), arising from or relating to THE USE OF IBOE, THE IBOE SITE, OR ANY IBOE DATA, INCLUDING DAMAGES RESULTING FROM THE USE OF OR INABILITY TO USE THE IBOE SITE OR THE IBOE DATA OR FROM ERRORS, OMISSIONS OR OTHER INACURRACIES IN THE IBOE DATA, EVEN IF YOU HAVE BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. WITHOUT PREJUDICE TO THE FOREGOING LIMITATION, THE AGGREGATE LIABILITY OF RENTRAK TO YOU, YOUR COMPANY AND ALL OTHER PERSONS GAINING ACCESS TO IBOE THROUGH YOUR COMPANY UNDER ANY AND ALL THEORIES, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO CONTRACT, BREACH OF WARRANTY, TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), OR PRODUCT LIABILITY, SHALL IN NO EVENT EXCEED THE AMOUNT PAID TO RENTRAK UNDER THE IBOE AGREEMENT DURING THE IMMEDIATELY PRECEDING SIX-MONTH PERIOD.\n\n10. Indemnification. You agree to indemnify, defend and hold harmless Rentrak, its affiliates, licensors, and their respective officers, directors, employees and agents from and against all losses, expenses, damages and costs, including reasonable attorneys' fees, arising out of the use of the IBOE Site or the IBOE Data by you or any other person using your password.\n\n11. Amendment of TOS. Rentrak shall have right to update, amend or restate these TOS without your consent and without giving you prior notice.\n\n12. Miscellaneous.

Any action or proceeding arising from or relating to these TOS shall be brought in a federal court in the State of Oregon, USA or in state court in Multnomah County, Oregon, USA and each party irrevocably submits to the jurisdiction and venue of any such court in any such action or proceeding.

Any waiver or failure to enforce any provision of these TOS on one occasion will not be deemed a waiver of any other provision or of such provision on any other occasion. If any provision of these TOS is determined to be unenforceable, such provision will be changed and interpreted to accomplish the objectives of such provision to the greatest extent possible under applicable law and the remaining provisions will continue in full force and effect. In the event of any conflicts between the terms of these TOS and the IBOE Agreement (if applicable), the terms of the IBOE Agreement shall control."
