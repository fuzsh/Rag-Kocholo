or\n\n13\n\n(iii) a number of shares of Common Stock equal to 10% or more of the number of shares of outstanding Common Stock as of such time (determined on an as-converted basis) (the Additional Common Stock) from a Person (other than another Stockholder and its Permitted Transferees), the Company shall, as promptly as is reasonably practicable, take all necessary action (to the extent not prohibited by applicable law) to cause the Board to (x) increase the size of the Board as required to enable the Buying Stockholder to designate one (1) additional Person to the Board, and (y) appoint such additional Person designated by the Buying Stockholder to fill such newly created vacancy and, thereafter, for so long as the Buying Stockholder beneficially owns at least 50% of the Additional Common Stock, the Company will take all necessary action (to the extent not prohibited by applicable law) to cause the Board to nominate for election at each annual or special meeting of stockholders at which directors are to be elected that number of individuals designated by the Buying Stockholder that, if elected, would result in one (1) additional Director designated by the Buying Stockholder serving on the Board and, if such individual is not so elected, cause such individual to be promptly appointed as a director. For the avoidance of doubt, the right to designate the additional Person to the Board pursuant to this clause (iii) shall not be triggered by the acquisition of Preferred Stock or conversion of Preferred Stock to Common Stock and shall, with respect to each Buying Stockholder, be limited to one (1) additional designee in total regardless of the number of shares of Common Stock acquired in excess of the 10% threshold pursuant to this Section 2.1(e).\n\n(f) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained elsewhere herein, in no event shall a Stockholder be entitled to designate a number of directors to the Board that would constitute a majority of the Board pursuant to this Section 2.1.\n\n(g) Subject to compliance with applicable laws, stock exchange regulations and the Settlement, for so long as the Charter Stockholder beneficially owns Voting Stock representing at least 5% of the outstanding shares of Common Stock (on an as-converted basis), the Company will take all necessary action (to the extent not prohibited by applicable law) to cause the Board to appoint (i) at least one Charter Director to serve on the compensation committee of the Board, (ii) at least one Charter Director to serve on the nominating and governance committee of the Board and (iii) at least one Charter Director to serve on the finance committee of the Board.\n\n(h) Subject to compliance with applicable laws, stock exchange regulations and the Settlement, for so long as the Qurate Stockholder beneficially owns Voting Stock representing at least 5% of the outstanding shares of Common Stock (on an as-converted basis), the Company will take all necessary action (to the extent not prohibited by applicable law) to cause the Board to appoint (i) at least one Qurate Director to serve on the compensation committee of the Board, (ii) at least one Qurate Director to serve on the nominating and governance committee of the Board and (iii) at least one Qurate Director to serve on the finance committee of the Board.\n\n(i) Subject to compliance with applicable laws, stock exchange regulations and the Settlement, for so long as the Cerberus Stockholder beneficially owns Voting Stock representing at least 5% of the outstanding shares of Common Stock (on an as-converted basis), the Company will take all necessary action (to the extent not prohibited by applicable law) to cause the Board to appoint (i) at least one Cerberus Director to serve on the compensation committee of the Board, (ii) at least one Cerberus Director to serve on the nominating and governance committee of the Board and (iii) at least one Cerberus Director to serve on the finance committee of the Board.\n\n14\n\n(j) In the event that any Stockholder has nominated fewer than the total number of designees that the Stockholder shall be entitled to nominate to the Board pursuant to this Section 2.1, then such Stockholder shall have the right, at any time and from time to time, to nominate such additional designee(s) to which it is entitled, in which case, the Company shall, as promptly as is reasonably practicable, take all necessary action (to the extent not prohibited by applicable law) to cause the Board to (x) increase the size of the Board as required to enable such Stockholder to so nominate such additional designee(s), and (y) appoint such additional designees nominated by such Stockholder to fill such newly created vacancy or vacancies, as applicable.\n\n(k) The Charter Stockholder may cause any Charter Director to resign (with or without cause) from time to time and at any time upon notice to the Company, the Qurate Stockholder may cause any Qurate Director to resign (with or without cause) from time to time and at any time upon notice to the Company, and the Cerberus Director may cause any Cerberus Director to resign (with or without cause) from time to time and at any time upon notice to the Company.\n\n(l) In the event that a vacancy is created on the Board by the death, disability, resignation or removal of a Director, the relevant Stockholder that designated such Director shall be entitled to designate an individual to fill the vacancy so long as (i) the total number of such Stockholders Directors serving on the Board immediately following the filling of such vacancy will not exceed the total number of Persons such Stockholder entitled to designate pursuant to this Section 2.1 on the date of such replacement designation and (ii) the replacement designee (A) will, if the departing Director being replaced qualified as independent within the meaning of Nasdaq Rule 5605(a) as of his or her departure (an Independent Director), qualify as an Independent Director and (B) does not serve on the board of directors or as an officer of a Competitor of the Company.

The Company is entitled to identify such individual(s) as Charter Director(s), Qurate Director(s) or Cerberus Director(s), as applicable, pursuant to this Agreement. The Company shall support each Charter Director, Qurate Director, and Cerberus Director for election in a manner no less rigorous and favorable than the manner in which the Company supports the other nominees.\n\n(n) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary provided elsewhere herein, promptly after a Stockholder is no longer entitled to designate or nominate for election a Person or Persons to the Board pursuant to the terms of this Section 2.1, such Stockholder shall cause the applicable number of its Directors to resign from the Board (it being understood that such individuals form of resignation letter that is required to be executed by such individual and held by the Company Secretary as a condition of membership on the Board shall be automatically effective upon the applicable Stockholders determination, which shall be communicated promptly to the Company Secretary thereupon).\n\n(o) For so long as a Stockholder beneficially owns Voting Stock representing at least 5% of the outstanding shares of Common Stock on an as-converted basis, each Stockholder agrees to vote, or provide a written consent or proxy with respect to, its Voting Stock, and to cause such Stockholders Permitted Transferees that become a party to this Agreement to vote, or provide a written consent or proxy with respect to, their Voting Stock, in each case in a neutral manner, in the election of any directors\n\n15\n\nnominated by the Board, other than pursuant to any Stockholders right to designate such Director pursuant to the terms of this Agreement. A neutral manner means in the same proportion as all other outstanding Common Stock of the Company (excluding any and all shares of Common Stock beneficially owned, directly or indirectly, by the Stockholders and their respective Permitted Transferees that become parties to this Agreement) voted on the relevant matters. For so long as this Section 2.1(o) applies to a Stockholder or its Permitted Transferee, each such Stockholder and Permitted Transferee shall be deemed to irrevocably appoint as its proxy and attorney-in-fact, the Chief Executive Officer, the Chief Financial Officer and the General Counsel of the Company, each of them individually, with full power of substitution and resubstitution, to consent to or vote any shares of Voting Stock held by them in accordance with this Section 2.1(o). Each Stockholder and Permitted Transferee intends this proxy to be irrevocable and unconditional and coupled with an interest and will take such further action or execute such other instruments as may be reasonably necessary to effect the intent of this proxy, and hereby revokes any proxy previously granted with respect hereto.\n\n(p) To the extent any Charter Director, Qurate Director or Cerberus Director is subject to a code of conduct by virtue of their service as a member of the Board, no such code of conduct shall (i) restrict any transfer of securities by the Stockholder designating such Director or its Affiliates (other than with respect to the Charter Director, Qurate Director or Cerberus Director, solely in his or her individual capacity) except as provided herein or as required by applicable law, (ii) impose confidentiality obligations on any such Director that would limit the ability of such Director to share information with the Stockholder designating such Director, (iii) impose any share ownership requirements for such Director or (iv) impose any additional obligations on the Stockholder designating such Director that would, in the case of clauses (i), (ii) and (iv), contravene or limit the rights of any Stockholder under this Agreement, the Certificate of Designations, the Purchase Agreements or any other document or agreement contemplated hereby or thereby, except as required by applicable laws, stock exchange regulations, background check policies or the Settlement with respect to restrictions on overboarding and requirements for interviews and a related party transactions policy and hedging and pledging policy. Notwithstanding anything in this Section 2.1(p) or Section 2.2 to the contrary, any equity securities or other equity-based compensation to which any Charter Director, Qurate Director or Cerberus Director is entitled in such Directors capacity as a director of the Company shall be (from issuance) Transferred by such Director to the Stockholder designating such Director or any Affiliate of such Stockholder, and the Company shall take all actions necessary to permit such Transfer.\n\n(q) If there is any event, transaction or circumstance that may result in any Stockholder, its Affiliates and/or the Director designated by such Stockholder being deemed to have made a disposition or acquisition of equity securities of the Company or derivatives thereof, to or from the Company, respectively, for purposes of Section 16 of the Exchange Act, and if such Director is serving on the Board at such time or has served on the Board at any time during the six (6) months preceding such event, transaction or circumstance, then (i) the Board or a committee thereof composed solely of two or more non-employee directors as defined in Rule 16b-3 of the Exchange Act will pre-approve such disposition or acquisition of equity securities of the Company or derivatives thereof, to or from the Company, respectively, for the express purpose of exempting the interests of such Stockholder, its Affiliates and the Director designated by such Stockholder (for the Stockholder and/or its Affiliates, to the extent such persons may be deemed to be directors by deputization) in such transaction from Section 16(b) of the Exchange Act pursuant to Rule 16b-3 thereunder or (ii) if the transaction involves (A) a merger or consolidation to which the Company is a party and the Capital Stock is, in whole or in part, converted into or exchanged for equity securities of a different issuer, (B) a potential acquisition or deemed acquisition, or disposition or deemed disposition, by a Stockholder, its Affiliates, and/or the Director designated by such Stockholder of equity securities of such other issuer or derivatives thereof and (C) an Affiliate or other designee of such\n\n16\n\nStockholder or its Affiliates will serve on the board of directors (or its equivalent) of such other issuer pursuant to the terms of an agreement to which the Company is a party (or if the Stockholder notifies the Company of such service a reasonable time in advance of the closing of such transactions), the Company shall require that such other issuer preapprove any such acquisitions of equity securities or derivatives thereof for the express purpose of exempting the interests of such Stockholder, its Affiliates and the Director designated by such Stockholder (for the Stockholder and/or its Affiliates, to the extent such persons may be deemed to be directors by deputization of such other issuer) in such transactions from Section 16(b) of the Exchange Act pursuant to Rule 16b-3 thereunder.\n\nSection 2.2 Director Compensation; Indemnification.\n\n(a) Each of the Charter Directors, the Qurate Directors and the Cerberus Directors shall be entitled to receive the same amount and type of compensation that the other non-employee directors receive in consideration for their service on the Board and any committees thereof.\n\n(b) The Company shall indemnify the Directors and provide such Directors with director and officer insurance to the same extent as it indemnifies and provides such insurance to other members of the Board, pursuant to the Certificate of Incorporation, the DGCL or otherwise. The Company acknowledges and agrees that it (i) is the indemnitor of first resort (i.e., its obligations to the Directors are primary and any obligation of the Stockholder or its Affiliates to advance expenses or to provide indemnification for the same expenses or liabilities incurred by Directors designated by such Stockholder are secondary) and (ii) shall be required to advance the amount of expenses incurred by Directors and shall be liable for the amount of all expenses and liabilities incurred by a Director, in each case to the same extent as it advances expenses and is liable for expenses and liabilities incurred by the other members of the Board, pursuant to the Certificate of Incorporation, the DGCL or otherwise, without regard to any rights that a Director may have against any Stockholder or its Affiliates.\n\n(c) Each Stockholder and the Company hereby agree, notwithstanding anything to the contrary in any other agreement or at law or in equity, that, to the maximum extent permitted by law, when such Stockholder or any of its Permitted Transferees takes any action under this Agreement to give or withhold their consent, such Persons shall have no duty (fiduciary or other) to consider the interests of the Company or the other stockholders of the Company and may act exclusively in their own interest; provided, however, that the foregoing shall in no way affect the obligations of the parties hereto to comply with the provisions of this Agreement.\n\nSection 2.3 Observers.\n\n(a) For so long as a Stockholder beneficially owns Voting Stock representing at least 5% of the outstanding shares of Common Stock (on an as-converted basis), such Stockholder shall be entitled to appoint one individual to attend and observe meetings of the Board or any committee thereof in a non-voting capacity (such individuals, Observers). The Observers will be permitted (i) to attend and participate at each meeting of the Board or any committee of which the Stockholders Director is a member, and (ii) to receive notice of each meeting of the Board and such committee, each written consent in lieu of a meeting and copies of any materials delivered to the Directors in connection therewith at the same time and in the same manner that such notice and such materials are provided to the Directors. Under no circumstances shall any Observers be counted for purposes of voting, quorum or any other reason or be considered a Director. Each Observer shall agree to maintain the confidentiality of all non-public information and proceedings of the Board pursuant to the terms and conditions of a confidentiality agreement in the form attached hereto as Exhibit A. Notwithstanding any rights to be granted or provided to the Observers hereunder, the Company may exclude an Observer from access to any Board or committee materials or information or meeting or portion thereof or written consent if the Board or applicable\n\n17\n\ncommittee determines, in good faith, that including such Observer in discussions relating to such determination (but not requiring the affirmative vote of such Observer) and/or that such access would reasonably be expected to (i) adversely affect the attorney-client privilege between the Company, the Board or any committee thereof and such Persons counsel, (ii) result in a conflict of interest with the Company (other than a conflict of interest with respect to the relevant Stockholders ownership interest in the Company or rights under the documents entered into in connection with the Transactions) or (iii) cause the Board (or such committee) to breach its fiduciary duties; provided, that such exclusion shall be limited to the portion of the Board or committee material or information and/or meeting or written consent that is the basis for such exclusion and shall not extend to any portion of the Board or committee material or information and/or meeting or written consent that does not involve or pertain to such exclusion; provided that the Board shall treat all similarly situated Observers equally such that no Observer shall be excluded unless all other Observers whose participation in such meeting of the Board, or portions thereof, or receipt of such information, or portions thereof, would result in a similar concern are also excluded. The decision of the Board (or such committee) shall be final and binding on the parties hereto, and each Stockholder hereby waives any objection to such decision and agrees to cause its applicable Observer to not interpose any objection to any such decision. The Observers will not be entitled to compensation from the Company.\n\n(b) Any Observer appointed by the Charter Stockholder may be removed (with or without cause) from time to time and at any time by the Charter Stockholder upon notice to the Company, any Observer appointed by the Qurate Stockholder may be removed (with or without cause) from time to time and at any time by the Qurate Stockholder upon notice to the Company, and any Observer appointed by the Cerberus Stockholder may be removed (with or without cause) from time to time and at any time by the Cerberus Stockholder upon notice to the Company.\n\nSection 2.4 Voting.

Each Stockholder and Permitted Transferee shall be present, in person or by proxy, at all meetings of the stockholders of the Company so that all shares of Preferred Stock or Common Stock beneficially owned by the such Persons may be counted for the purposes of determining the presence of a quorum and voted in accordance with this Agreement at such meetings (including at any adjournments or postponements thereof).\n\nSection 2.5 Restriction on Other Agreements. The Stockholders shall not, directly or indirectly, grant any proxy or enter into or agree to be bound by any voting trust, agreement or arrangement of any kind with respect to their shares of Voting Stock if and to the extent the terms thereof conflict with the provisions of this Agreement (whether or not such proxy, voting trust, agreement or agreements are with other holders of shares of Common Stock or Preferred Stock that are not parties to this Agreement or otherwise).\n\nARTICLE III\n\nOWNERSHIP AND TRANSFER OF STOCK\n\nSection 3.1 Restrictions on Transfer.\n\n(a) Subject to the exceptions set forth below, each Stockholder agrees not to, without the prior written consent of the Board (excluding any Directors designated by the Stockholder seeking a Transfer), directly or indirectly, (i) transfer, sell, hypothecate, pledge, grant any option to purchase or otherwise dispose of any shares of Preferred Stock held by such Stockholder, including any shares of Common Stock\n\n18\n\nissued or issuable upon conversion of such shares of Preferred Stock (Lock-Up Shares), (ii) enter into any swap or other arrangement that transfers to another, in whole or in part, any of the economic consequences of ownership of any of, or Hedge, such Lock-Up Shares, whether any such transaction is to be settled by delivery of such securities, in cash or otherwise or (iii) publicly announce any intention to effect any transaction specified in clause (i) or (ii) (the actions specified collectively in clauses (i)  (ii), other than any entry into a cash-settled Hedge, a Transfer), in each case, for one (1) year after the Closing Date. Thereafter, until the two (2) year anniversary of the Closing Date, subject to the exceptions set forth below, each Stockholder agrees (without the prior written consent of the Board, excluding any Directors designated by the Stockholder seeking a Transfer or cash-settled Hedge) not to Transfer or enter into a cash-settled Hedge with respect to more than 50% of such Stockholders Initial Preferred Stock Ownership, including any shares of Common Stock issued or issuable upon conversion of such Preferred Stock; provided that in connection with any such Transfer permitted until the two (2) year anniversary of the Closing Date or any Transfer after such date, such Stockholder shall not Transfer any shares of Preferred Stock held by such Stockholder, including any shares of Common Stock issued or issuable upon conversion of such shares of Preferred Stock, to an Activist Investor, to a Competitor or to a Restricted Person, in each case, to the extent that the identity of the transaction counterparty can be reasonably ascertained and such Person meets the applicable definition thereof to such Stockholders knowledge after reasonable inquiry (excluding (x) any block trade in which a broker-dealer will attempt to sell the shares to a third-party as agent or other similar transactions with a financial intermediary, (y) any Transfers into the public market pursuant to a bona fide, broadly distributed underwritten public offering or (z) Transfers through a bona fide sale to the public, which is not directed at a particular transferee, without registration effectuated pursuant to Rule 144 under the Securities Act (such transactions in clauses (x) through (z), a Marketed Transfer)); provided that the provisions of the foregoing clause shall not apply in connection with a Transfer of shares of Preferred Stock or Common Stock issued upon conversion of the Preferred Stock in connection with any foreclosure or exercise of remedies under a Permitted Loan in which case only the Foreclosure Limitations shall be applicable. If the Board consents to a Transfer by one Stockholder pursuant to this Section 3.1(a), it shall treat requests for Transfers by other Stockholders in an equivalent manner such that it shall not unreasonably withhold its consent to any substantially similar Transfer by any such other Stockholder.\n\n(b) Any attempt to Transfer in violation of the terms of this Agreement shall be null and void ab initio and no right, title or interest therein or thereto shall be transferred to the purported transferee. The Company will not give, and will not permit the Companys transfer agent to give, any effect to such attempted Transfer on its records.\n\n(c) Subject to Section 6.16, each certificate and/or book-entry interest representing shares of Preferred Stock or Common Stock issuable upon conversion of shares of Preferred Stock held by any Stockholder (or its Permitted Transferees) will bear a legend in substantially the following form:\n\nThe securities represented by this certificate have not been registered under the United States Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the Act), or applicable state securities laws and may not be transferred, sold or otherwise disposed of except while a registration statement relating thereto is in effect under the Act and applicable state securities laws or pursuant to an exemption from registration under such or act or such laws.

or (b) in the event that a tender offer or exchange offer for at least 50.1% of the Capital Stock of the Company is commenced by a third person (and not involving any breach, by a Stockholder, of this Section 3.2), which tender offer or exchange offer, if consummated, would result in a Change of Control, and either (1) the directors (excluding any Directors designated by the Stockholders) recommend that the stockholders of the Company tender their shares in response to such offer or do not recommend against the tender offer or exchange offer within ten (10) business days after the commencement thereof or such longer period as shall then be permitted under U.S. federal securities laws or (2) the directors (excluding any Directors designated by the Stockholders) later publicly recommend that the stockholders of the Company tender their shares in response to such offer.\n\nNotwithstanding the foregoing, solely with respect to the Qurate Stockholder, references in this Section 3.2 to Affiliates shall mean Affiliates acting at the direction of or in concert with the Qurate Stockholder or any of its Permitted Transferees and any of the foregoing Persons respective Subsidiaries.\n\n22\n\nSection 3.3 Right of First Refusal.\n\nSubject to applicable securities laws and to the terms and conditions specified in this Section 3.3 and the other restrictions set forth in this Agreement, each Stockholder, on behalf of itself and its controlled Affiliates, hereby grants to each other Stockholder a right of first refusal as set forth below (the Right of First Refusal) to purchase shares of Preferred Stock or Common Stock; provided, that, notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, the Right of First Refusal shall not be granted in respect of Cash-settled Exchangeables and Equity Linked Financings.\n\n(a) From and after the Closing Date, no Stockholder or its controlled Affiliate shall, directly or indirectly through Transferring ownership interest of a controlled Affiliate thereof, Transfer any shares of Preferred Stock or Common Stock to another Person (other than Excluded Transfers and any Marketed Transfers) (each, a Subject Transaction) except in accordance with the following provisions:\n\n(i) If, at any time, a Stockholder (the Transferring Stockholder) receives a written offer (including from another Stockholder) for a Subject Transaction that the Transferring Stockholder desires to accept, the Transferring Stockholder shall, within three (3) business days following receipt of such offer, deliver, together with a copy of such offer, a written notice (the Transfer Notice) to each of the other Stockholders (whether or not a party to the proposed Transfer) (together with each such Stockholders Permitted Transferees, a Non-Transferring Stockholder) stating (A) its bona fide intention to Transfer such shares of Preferred Stock and/or Common Stock pursuant to such Subject Transaction, (B) the identity of all proposed parties to such Subject Transaction, (C) the number of such shares of Preferred Stock or Common Stock to be Transferred pursuant to such Subject Transaction (the ROFR Amount), and (D) the proposed purchase price, which must be payable in cash, and the terms and conditions of the written offer, upon which the Transferring Stockholder proposes to Transfer such shares of Preferred Stock and/or Common Stock (including the proposed date of the closing of the Subject Transaction, which shall in no event be less than forty-five (45) business days from the date of the Transfer Notice) (clauses (B) through (D), collectively, the Minimum Terms). The Transfer Notice shall constitute the Transferring Stockholders irrevocable, binding offer to Transfer such shares of Preferred Stock or Common Stock to the Non-Transferring Stockholders (as between the Non-Transferring Stockholders, pro rata based on their relative beneficial ownership of the Voting Stock at such time) pursuant to the Minimum Terms.\n\n(ii) Within thirty-five (35) business days after receipt of the Transfer Notice, each of the Non-Transferring Stockholders may elect to purchase any portion or all of its pro rata portion of the ROFR Amount at the price and on the terms and conditions specified in the Transfer Notice. In the event that either of the Non-Transferring Stockholders does not elect to purchase its entire pro rata portion of the ROFR Amount within thirty-five (35) business days after the receipt of the Transfer Notice, the Transferring Stockholder shall notify the other Non-Transferring Stockholder of such election, and such other Non-Transferring Stockholder shall have ten (10) business days after its receipt of such notice to purchase the remaining amount of the ROFR Amount in respect of which such Non-Transferring Stockholders rights were not exercised pursuant to this Section 3.3(a). At the end of such ten (10) business day period, if none of the Non-Transferring Stockholders have elected to purchase any of the ROFR Amount or all the Non-Transferring Stockholders, collectively, have not elected to purchase, in the aggregate, the entire ROFR Amount, the Non-Transferring Stockholders will be deemed to have declined to exercise their rights under this Section 3.3(a)(ii) with respect to the balance of the ROFR Amount and the Transferring Stockholder shall have forty-five (45) business days (which forty-five (45) business day period will be extended, if the Transferring Stockholder has entered into a definitive agreement in respect of such Transfer prior to such time and the Transfer is subject to regulatory approval, until four (4) business days after such approval or approvals have been received, but in no event by more than an additional forty-five (45) business days) thereafter to sell the entire ROFR Amount, at a price in cash not lower, and upon\n\n23\n\nother terms and conditions that are not more favorable to the purchasers thereof in any material respect, than the price and the terms and conditions specified in the Transfer Notice. If the Transferring Stockholder has not consummated the Transfer of all or a portion of ROFR Amount within such forty-five (45) business days (or such extended period contemplated by the preceding sentence), the Transferring Stockholder shall not thereafter engage in a Subject Transaction and Transfer any shares of Preferred Stock or Common Stock without first offering such securities to each of the Non-Transferring Stockholders in the manner provided in this Section 3.3(a).\n\n(b) From and after the Closing Date, no Stockholder or its controlled Affiliate shall, directly or indirectly through Transferring ownership interest of a controlled Affiliate thereof, Transfer any shares of Preferred Stock or Common Stock to another Person through a Marketed Transfer (other than an Excluded Transfer) except in accordance with the following provisions:\n\n(i) If a Stockholder intends to execute a Marketed Transfer with respect to shares of Preferred Stock or Common Stock, at least ten (10) business days prior to the proposed initiation date of the Marketed Transfer, such Stockholder shall provide a written notice to the other Stockholders, which notice shall set forth its good faith estimate of the number of shares of Preferred Stock or Common Stock proposed to be Transferred and the proposed purchase price, which must be payable in cash.\n\n(ii) At least five (5) business days prior to the initiation of the Marketed Transfer, the Stockholder shall provide a written notice (a Marketing Notice) to each of the other Stockholders stating (i) its bona fide intention to Transfer such shares of Preferred Stock and/or Common Stock pursuant to such Marketed Transfer, (ii) the identity of all proposed parties (including any underwriters) to such Marketed Transfer, to the extent known, (iii) the number of such shares of Preferred Stock or Common Stock to be Transferred pursuant to such Marketed Transfer (the Marketed Amount), and (iv) the proposed purchase price, which must be payable in cash, and the other terms and conditions of the Marketed Transfer (clauses (ii) through (iv), collectively, the Marketing Terms). The Marketing Notice shall constitute the Transferring Stockholders irrevocable, binding offer to Transfer such shares of Preferred Stock or Common Stock to the other Stockholders (as between the other Stockholders, pro rata based on their relative beneficial ownership of the Voting Stock at such time) pursuant to the Marketing Terms.\n\n(iii) Within five (5) business days after receipt of the Marketing Notice, each of the other Stockholders may elect to purchase any portion or all of its pro rata portion of the Marketed Amount at the price and on the terms and conditions specified in the Marketing Notice. At the end of such five (5) business day period, if none of the other Stockholders have elected to purchase any of the Marketed Amount or all the Non-Transferring Stockholders, collectively, have not elected to purchase, in the aggregate, the entire ROFR Amount, the other Stockholders will be deemed to have declined to exercise their rights under this Section 3.3(b)(iii) with respect to the balance of the Marketed Amount and the Transferring Stockholder shall have fifteen (15) business days thereafter to sell through a Marketed Transfer all or any portion of the Marketed Amount in respect of which each of the other Stockholders rights were not exercised pursuant to this Section 3.3(b), at a price in cash not lower than 95% of the price set forth in its Marketing Notice, and upon other terms and conditions that are not more favorable to the purchasers thereof in any material respect than the terms and conditions specified in the Marketing Notice. If the Stockholder initiating the Marketed Transfer has not consummated the Marketed Transfer of such Marketed Amount within such fifteen (15) business days, such Stockholder shall not thereafter Transfer any shares of Preferred Stock through a Marketed Transfer without first offering such securities to each of the other Stockholders in the manner provided in this Section 3.3(b).\n\n24\n\n(c) The closing of the purchase of any ROFR Amount or Marketed Amount by the Stockholder exercising its Right of First Refusal shall occur ten (10) business days after the date on which such Stockholder shall have elected to purchase such ROFR Amount or Marketed Amount; provided that, in the event all required regulatory approvals (including, if required, the expiration or other termination of the waiting period under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, as amended) have not been received prior to the end of such ten (10) business day period, the closing date shall be extended until two (2) business days after all such required approvals have been received. At the closing, the Stockholder Transferring the ROFR Amount or Marketed Amount shall deliver documents conveying title to such ROFR Amount or Marketed Amount to the purchasing Stockholder(s), free and clear of any liens or encumbrances (except for restrictions arising under any applicable securities laws or this Agreement), and any other instruments or instructions required to effectuate such Transfer and the purchase price shall be paid by wire transfer of immediately available funds, to an account designated by the Stockholder Transferring the ROFR Amount or Marketed Amount at least three (3) business days prior to the closing date.\n\n(d) For the avoidance of doubt, this Section 3.3 may only be enforced, amended or waived by, and shall only inure to the benefit of, the Stockholders and their respective successors and permitted assigns, and the Company shall have no right to enforce, and the consent of the Company is not required to amend or waive, the provisions of this Section 3.3; provided, however, that the Stockholders shall provide the Company with prior notice of any such amendment or waiver.\n\n(e) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary that limits the ability of a Person to assign or transfer its rights hereunder, a Stockholder that exercises its Right of First Refusal pursuant to this Section 3.3 may designate any of its Permitted Transferees to purchase all or part of the shares of such Preferred Stock and/or Common Stock; provided that such Stockholder shall remain obligated to consummate the purchase if such designees fail to do so.\n\nSection 3.4 Issuer Repurchases. Each Stockholder agrees that, at any time when such Stockholder beneficially owns Voting Stock representing at least 45% of the outstanding shares of Common Stock (on an as-converted basis), such Stockholder and its controlled Affiliates will, upon the Companys prior written notice delivered at least five (5) business days before the proposed repurchase, participate pro rata in any open market repurchases of Common Stock by the Company and execute, deliver, acknowledge and file such other documents and take such further actions as may be necessary to give effect to and carry out this agreement; provided that each Stockholder shall convert a number of shares of Preferred Stock into Common Stock necessary to participate pro rata in such open market repurchases, to the extent required "
