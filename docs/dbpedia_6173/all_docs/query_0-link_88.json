        "text": "ComScore has delayed the filing of its annual report — Form 10-K — due to “potential accounting matters,” the company said on Monday. As a result, the stock has plummeted about 34 percent today.\n\nThe data and analytics company is also postponing its previously scheduled March 16 Investor Day. Finally, comScore’s share repurchase program is on hiatus until a review is completed.\n\n“On Feb. 19, 2016, the Audit Committee of comScore’s Board of Directors received a message regarding certain potential accounting matters,” the company revealed this morning via a media release.\n\nAlso Read: ComScore Grows Q4 Subscription Sales, Sets $125 Million Stock Buyback\n\nIn response, 10 days after the tip came in, comScore filed a Notification of Late Filing with the SEC, and an intention to file within 15 days. That no longer seems likely, however, and an Audit Committee and comScore’s own independent public accountants are still crunching numbers as the associated SCOR ones go way down.\n\nRepresentatives from comScore declined TheWrap‘s request for comment.\n\nEarlier this year, comScore completed its acquisition of media measurement company Rentrak.\n\nAlso Read: Rentrak-comScore Merger Complete: Read New Ratings Company's Memo\n\nHere’s a look at comScore’s rough stock day, just before market close:\n\nRelated stories from TheWrap:\n\nNielsen Boss Shrugs Off ComScore-Rentrak Merger: 'Good for Them'\n\nComScore Buys Rentrak in Effort to Give Nielsen Run for Its Money\n\nComScore, Rentrak Chiefs on Why Media is Celebrating Today and What's Next for the Measurement Giants"
