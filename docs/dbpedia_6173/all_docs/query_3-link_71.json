        "text": "It was a year of haves and have-nots: a period in which a slightly simmering economy helped the richest, but certainly not the masses.\n\nOccupy Wall Street? No, we're talking about how investors treated the 37 publicly traded Oregon companies that make up the Bloomberg Oregonian Stock Index.\n\nThey were skittish and picky, rueful of surprises. But generally, they rewarded the well-managed, financially fit members of the index that reported steady earnings growth. Resilient consumers and businesses investing in new equipment boosted these firms' bottom lines. High or increased dividends also proved attractive as retirees and others cast about for yield.\n\nOf the 13 stocks that finished the year in positive territory, four were heavy manufacturers. A couple of banks, tech firms, utilities and consumer-products marketers also did well.\n\n\"Diversification of our economic base has helped us,\" said Fred Dickson, chief investment strategist for D.A. Davidson & Co., a financial services firm in Lake Oswego.\n\nThe Oregonian Index stocks\n\nThe best- and worst-performing stocks of 2011\n\nTop 10\n\n.\n\n+ 54.4 percent; Friday close of $40.78\n\n.\n\n+ 53 percent; $21.86\n\n.\n\n+ 28.4 percent; $19.96\n\n.\n\n+ 18.4 percent; $164.79\n\n.\n\n+ 16.5 percent; $25.29\n\n.\n\n+ 15.7 percent; $24.48\n\n.\n\n+ 13 percent; $13.56\n\n+ 12.8 percent; $96.37\n\n+ 10.6 percent; $15.60\n\nSchmitt Industries Inc.\n\n+ 9.6 percent; $3.20\n\nWorst 10\n\nPremierWest Bancorp\n\n- 76.4 percent; Friday close of $0.80\n\n.\n\n- 58.3 percent; $4.87\n\n.\n\n- 52.7 percent; $14.28\n\nPaulson Capital Corp.\n\n- 51.4 percent; $0.53\n\n- 48.2 percent; $4.38\n\n.\n\n- 43.2 percent; $5.06\n\n.\n\n- 36.3 percent; $42.28\n\n.\n\n- 23.1 percent; $12.62\n\n.\n\n- 22.8 percent; $46.55\n\n.\n\n- 21.6 percent; $3.41\n\nSource: Bloomberg\n\nMost didn't pass those stiff standards, however. Overall, the Oregonian Index of the region's publicly traded companies fell 2.7 percent in 2011. That follows gains of 15.5 percent in 2009 and\n\n. Losers outnumbered winners nearly 2-to-1 last year.\n\nof large public companies finished 2011 flat. The Nasdaq stock market fell 1.8 percent. The broader Wilshire 5,000 Total Market index, which tracks virtually all publicly traded stocks, fell 1.27 percent.\n\nBubbling to the top of the Oregonian Index was\n\n, maker of electron microscopes used by the semiconductor industry and academic researchers. It recorded its best year ever in 2010, and investors finally took notice by pushing its stock price up 54 percent in 2011.\n\nFEI nearly topped 2010's revenue total in the third quarter, and it more than doubled its net income. It bought a German microscope company,\n\nin November.\n\nOne of its products got mass exposure when Intel employees sat President Barack Obama in front of an FEI Titan scope during his February visit in Hillsboro. Later in the year, Daniel Schechtman, winner of the 2011 Nobel Prize in chemistry, told an Israeli news organization that without the Titan microscope, his 1984 discovery of a new form of matter -- quasicrystals -- would've been delayed.\n\nLike FEI, Medford-based\n\n' stock also gained more than 50 percent during the year. The auto dealership chain's revenues grew 30 percent in the first three months of last year, but its net income more than quadrupled, to $40 million, during the same period. Flush with cash, it expanded its stock repurchase program and boosted its quarterly dividend to 7 cents from 5 cents a share. In April, it bought three Portland-area German car dealerships from the Don Rasmussen Group.\n\nLenders noticed. Lithia received $200 million in new financing in September that executives say should boost earnings.\n\n\"Its execution and business model are outstanding,\" Morningstar analyst David Whiston wrote in October after Lithia announced blockbuster quarterly earnings. Four of every five of its dealerships have no competitor within 100 miles, which gives Lithia good pricing power, Whiston noted.\n\nAround Portland, Lithia plans to hire nearly 100 new employees to staff new Mercedes and Mini dealerships opening in Beaverton, President and Chief Operating Officer Bryan DeBoer said.\n\n\"We have really good balance sheet structure now,\" said his father, Chairman Sid DeBoer. \"We can buy stores. We can pay dividends. The company has never been healthier. And that's a nice thing to know.\"\n\n. saw its stock price grow 28 percent last year. This after its chairman, president, chief executive officer and largest single stockholder, William W. Sherertz, died unexpectedly Jan. 20.\n\nThe price jump came after Oct. 25, when Barrett announced record third-quarter earnings and revenues and said results would be better than expected the rest of the year. Executives say they've been able to raise prices for its services and get more employers to use its payroll and human-resource management services.\n\n\"Our clients are moving forward, they are continuing to add hours although they are not hiring a lot of people,\" Chief Executive Michael Elich told analysts in October. \"Once you add hours, eventually you reach a point of capacity of each individual, and you have to add individual head counts to expand that.\"\n\nThe next five top performers are Oregon business stalwarts.\n\nand\n\n, the state's only Fortune 500 firms, continued to build market value. They also are among the few whose stock prices now top their pre-recession levels.\n\nPrecision's sales grew 19 percent in the second quarter ended Oct. 2, and it said it expects aerospace sales to continue their ascent through 2012.\n\nNike's revenues topped $20.8 billion in its fiscal 2011 ended Aug. 31 even before the company reaps benefits from sales drivers such as the Summer Olympics in London and a new contract to outfit NFL teams next season. Its stock price grew nearly 13 percent and has safely passed its June 2008 pre-recession high of $70.07.\n\nThe prices of\n\n. and\n\n, meanwhile, both recorded gains, benefiting from investor preference for firms paying healthy dividends.\n\n\"This has been a year where investors have been seeking yield,\" Dickson said. With interest rates at rock-bottom levels, short-term CDs paying next to nothing and bond yields dropping, investors opted for stocks that consistently pay dividends to meet their income needs.\n\n. railcar order backlog more than tripled in its fiscal year that ended Aug. 31 as manufacturing revenues nearly returned to pre-recession levels. Its stock jumped 16 percent.\n\nalso did well, despite a long and\n\n. It figures to post $1 billion in sales for the year, the first homegrown tech company to reach that level since Tektronix was sold in 2007.\n\nThe macroeconomic trends benefiting these companies did not lift everyone.\n\n.'s stock fell 23 percent for the year, even though analysts project earnings growth of about 25 percent. Most of the drop came after the company last summer said revenues would fall short of expectations. A warm winter also might've soured scrooges, er, investors on the outerwear maker, said Sara Hasan, senior analyst with McAdams Wright Ragen Inc. in Seattle.\n\n.'s stock got punished even more, also after it revised estimates downward. Production constraints forced it to turn away business, though it's now expanding in Hillsboro. Its products -- wireless chips -- figure to remain in demand in the foreseeable future; a pair\n\n.\n\nTwo banks -- PremierWest Bancorp and Cascade Bancorp -- lost 76 and 48 percent of their stock value respectively as investors fled banks that are too weak to absorb a troubled peer, Dickson said.\n\n. dropped 53 percent as Wall Street doubted the company's efforts to offset the steep drop in video and DVD rentals,\n\n.\n\nUnlike in 2010, when banks were still failing, the Oregonian Index didn't contract. But it didn't expand either. The market for initial public offerings hardened as markets got volatile in late summer.\n\nTripwire, for instance,\n\nin May and sold instead to private equity firm Thoma Bravo. Metal-parts manufacturer\n\nwould but has yet to pull the trigger.\n\nbut had moved its headquarters from Portland to Silicon Valley in 2010. Erickson Air-Crane Inc. announced a public offering in May 2010 but\n\nwith profitability and its debt obligations since.\n\nFor 2012? The index could gain its first new member since Oregon's last IPO in 2004. And Dickson of D.A. Davidson & Co., for one, expects its members' fortunes to continue to improve, albeit more slowly.\n\n\"We're going to see earnings growth (this) year for Oregon companies at about half the growth rate we saw this year,\" Dickson said. \"It doesn't mean they're facing problems.\"\n\n; 503-221-8359."
