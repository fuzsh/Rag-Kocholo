        "text": "I guess on this thread I am the only person who has ever dealt with, or been a part of, the video rental biz. If not excuse me - but reading the repsonses thus far lead me to feel this way. (well - US anyway. Shannon is very wrong with most of his comment for example - \"NO, they cannot rent your DVD for profit.\" = Wrong. \"They cannot exhibition it to a group of people in a bar without your consent...\" = true, \"much less rent it to the public and collect money.\" = Wrong. Bob on the other hand is right on - he is in Oz but seems like they are a lot like the U.S in how the define first sale)\n\nOk - first of all from what I understand Dan has a distribution deal with someone. The whole point is that they offer your film for sale to the public - which includes stores, libraries and my next door neighbor. Now say Blockbuster comes in and buys 5,000 copies of it and you see it being rented. Nothing you can do. Now say the mom and pop down the street buys two copies they rent it. Again, nothing you can do. Say my neighbor buys one copy and lets all his friends borrow it for free. Nothing you can do.\n\nDo a search in these forums for my thread on George Atkinson when he died. Short version is he opend the first video rental store and was threatend with a lawsuit for renting video but he won because the copyright law allows for rental. Look up the \"First Sale Doctrine\" to get more details. People tried for years to pass a law that would, as many are suggesting here, allow someone to prevent a store from renting videos without permission from the copyright holder. The proposed law fizzled in Congress in 1984.\n\nNow there are some logical exceptions to this - say you had no distribution at all and someone copied a screener and rented it (or sold it for that matter). No, clearly not acceptable. Say your film airs on some cable outlet, is taped, and is rented or sold. Again - not acceptable. (although there is a fine line with things like \"I taped it and it is my copy so I am just selling off the copy I taped\" and \"I am really only selling the tape stock and there happens to be this HBO special taped on that stock.\" Look around ebay for many examples of this sort of thing. And this is sort of an offshoot of the whole Sony Corp. v. Universal City Studios, Inc. lawsuit)\n\nOk ok - so some will still say \"Ok Filmy has no clue, he really is full of it. Get lawyer.\" Fine - pay a lawyer and they will tell you something along the lines of the following: Public Distribution.—Clause (3) of section 106 establishes the exclusive right of publication: The right “to distribute copies or phonorecords of the copyrighted work to the public by sale or other transfer of ownership, or by rental, lease, or lending.” Under this provision the copyright owner would have the right to control the first public distribution of an authorized copy or phonorecord of his work, whether by sale, gift, loan, or some rental or lease arrangement. Likewise, any unauthorized public distribution of copies or phonorecords that were unlawfully made would be an infringement. As section 109 makes clear, however, the copyright owner’s rights under section 106 (3) cease with respect to a particular copy or phonorecord once he has parted with ownership of it.\n\nIn basic terms it means that anyone who has actualy bought a copy of your publicy available video can do almost anything with it in the scope of the copyright law. You allowed someone to sell your DVD - this much you have control over. But once that copy is sold you no longer have any say. So I can buy a copy of your DVD and than resell it if I want to. If I happen to own some sort of video store I can sell it there and rent is as well. Or I could loan out my copy to anyone who wanted it - as could a Library who had also purchased a copy. I can put it up on Ebay for sale, I can take it into any store that will buy used DVD's.\n\nNow video (DVD) has sort of gone unchallaged since 1984 but other forms have - so there was The Record Rental Amendment of 1984 and the Computer Software Rental Amendments Act. People tried to get games to fall under software but that didn't fully go through.\n\nNo one here has to beleive me yet - but that is your choice. But it is true and it is the law.\n\nEDIT - oh - how could I forget the DMCA. My bad. A lot of talk about various things including the whole concept of First Sale. In part the summary says: We recommend no change to section 109 at this time. Although speculative concerns have been raised, there was no convincing evidence of present-day problems. In order to recommend a change in the law, there should be a demonstrated need for the change that outweighs the negative aspects of the proposal. The Copyright Office does not believe that this is the case with the proposal to expand the scope of section 109 to include digital transmissions. The time may come when Congress may wish to address these concerns should they materialize.\n\n[SNIP]\n\nSection 109 permits \"the owner of a particular copy or phonorecord lawfully made\" under title 17 to distribute that copy without the copyright owner's permission. To the extent that section 107 permits a user to make a backup copy of a work stored on a hard drive, that copy is lawfully made and the user owns it. Section 109, on its face, appears to permit the user to sell or otherwise dispose of the possession of that backup copy. The legislative history can be read to support either view.\n\n[SNIP]\n\nThe question of contract preemption was raised by a number commenters who argued that the Copyright Act should be amended to insure that contract provisions that override consumer privileges in the copyright law, or are otherwise unreasonable, are not enforceable. Although the general issue of contract preemption is outside the scope of this Report, we do note that this issue is complex and of increasing practical importance, and thus legislative action appears to be premature. On the one hand, copyright law has long coexisted with contract law. On the other hand, the movement at the state level toward resolving questions as to the enforceability of nonnegotiated contracts coupled with legally-protected technological measures that give right holders the technological capability of imposing contractual provisions unilaterally, increases the possibility that right holders, rather than Congress, will determine the landscape of consumer privileges in the future. Although market forces may well prevent right holders from unreasonably limiting consumer privileges, it is possible that at some point in the future a case could be made for statutory change.\n\nTo read the entire summary go here: Executive Summary - Digital Millennium Copyright Act\n\nKen re-read my post. It is extremely clear what the law is in the US. While you can control \"first sale\" you cannot control what happens after that.\n\n...on the box and in your terms and condition, state that the product cannot be rented nor resold, and the customer agrees to those terms by buying, than it's an individually binding license agreement between buyer and seller.\n\nAnd this is exacly what was talked about in reguards to the whole DCMA, which i quote in the last part of my post above and will re-quote a bit here: On the one hand, copyright law has long coexisted with contract law. On the other hand, the movement at the state level toward resolving questions as to the enforceability of nonnegotiated contracts coupled with legally-protected technological measures that give right holders the technological capability of imposing contractual provisions unilaterally, increases the possibility that right holders, rather than Congress, will determine the landscape of consumer privileges in the future. Although market forces may well prevent right holders from unreasonably limiting consumer privileges, it is possible that at some point in the future a case could be made for statutory change.\n\nSome keywords are \"in the future\" and part of that is simple - technology. The limited use DVD's that came out for example. After 5 or so plays that is it. Macrovision and other copy protection is a type of this as well. As Bob pointed out in his post just because you put somehting on a sleeve or even at the head of a show, doesn't mean it voided the whole concept of First Sale. If I buy a copy of your DVD and I want to sell it at a garage sale you, currently, would not be able to stop me. As section 109 makes clear, however, the copyright owner’s rights under section 106 (3) cease with respect to a particular copy or phonorecord once he has parted with ownership of it. and notwithstanding the provisions of section 106(3), the owner of a particular copy or phonorecord lawfully made under this title, or any person authorized by such owner, is entitled, without the authority of the copyright owner, to sell or otherwise dispose of the possession of that copy or phonorecord.\n\nOn a like topic - I have several movie posters. (1- sheets, a fre britsh quads and so on) At the bottom of the US 1-sheets it clearly says the posters are property of the MPAA and can not be resold. How come every collectable shop around the world has not been shut down? Look at the \"previously viewed\" DVD and Video section. Most all of this product also has the normal junk on it as well. Yet the previously viewed market is huge and places like DV&A are not entanlged in copyright lawsuits."
