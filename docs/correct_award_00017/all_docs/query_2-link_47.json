This set the stage for his best-known work, the discovery of superconductivity three years later. Superconductivity is the phenomenon in which certain metals including lead and mercury show decreasing and finally no electrical resistance as temperatures approach absolute zero (0° Kelvin or -273.15° Celsius).\n\nKamerlingh Onnes also conducted research that added evidence for the atomic theory of matter, and his doctoral thesis (1879) provided a new and simplified proof of the earth's rotation. He studied under Robert Wilhelm Bunsen and Gustav Robert Kirchhoff, worked closely with Johannes Diderik van der Waals, and won the Nobel Prize for Physics in 1913. In press accounts of his time he was commonly called \"The gentleman of absolute zero\".\n\nFather: Harm Kamerlingh Onnes (brickworks owner, b. 24-Jun-1819)\n\nMother: Anna Gerdina Coers (b. 12-Jul-1819, m. 1852)\n\nWife: Maria Adriana Wilhelmina Elisabeth Bijleveld (m. 8-Sep-1887, d. 7-Dec-1938, one son)\n\nSon: Albert Kamerlingh Onnes (civil servant)\n\nHigh School: Groningen Hoogere Burgerschool, Groningen, Netherlands (1870)\n\nUniversity: BS equiv., University of Groningen (1871)\n\nUniversity: University of Heidelberg (attended, 1871-73)\n\nUniversity: MS equiv., University of Groningen (1878)\n\nUniversity: PhD, University of Groningen (1879)\n\nTeacher: Delft University of Technology, Delft, Netherlands (1878-82)\n\nProfessor: Experimental Physics, University of Leiden (1882-1923)\n\nMatteucci Medal 1910\n\nRumford Medal 1912\n\nNobel Prize for Physics 1913\n\nAccademia dei Lincei\n\nOrder of the Netherlands Lion Chevalier (1904)\n\nOrder of the Netherlands Lion Commander (1923)\n\nCommander Cross of the Royal St. Olaf Order\n\nFranklin Institute Foreign Member\n\nFrench Academy of Sciences Foreign Member\n\nRoyal Institution of Great Britain Foreign Member\n\nRoyal Netherlands Academy of Sciences 1913\n\nRoyal Society Foreign Member (1916)\n\nRoyal Prussian Academy of Sciences Foreign Member (1926)\n\nDutch Ancestry\n\nAuthor of books:\n\nThrough Measurement to Knowledge: Selected Papers of Heike Kamerlingh Onnes (1991, papers)\n\nNew!\n\nNNDB MAPPER Create a map starting with Heike Kamerlingh Onnes\n\nRequires Flash 7+ and Javascript.\n\nDo you know something we don't?\n\nSubmit a correction or make a comment about this profile"
