Kamerlingh Onnes proposed the virial equation of state (a significant improvement over the one of van der Waals), extended the concept of corresponding states, performed brilliant work on the achievement of very low temperatures, studied the behaviour of materials at these low temperatures, and discovered the phenomenon of superconductivity. he was awarded the 1913 Nobel Prize for physics for this investigations on the properties of matter at low temperature, which eventually led him to liquify helium 1908.\n\nAB - The main scientific contributions of Heike Kamerlingh Onnes (1853-1926) were onthermodynamics, the equation of state, and optical, magnetic, and electrical phenomena.
