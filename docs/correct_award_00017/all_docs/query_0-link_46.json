        "text": "Celebrating Helium Conservation Day\n\nOn 10th July 1908, helium was liquefied for the first time by the Dutch physicist Heike Kamerlingh-Onnes at the University of Leiden in the Netherlands. To commemorate this groundbreaking discovery, 10th July has been marked as the Helium Conservation Day. Companies in the field of cryogenics celebrate this day not only to mark this discovery but also to increase awareness for helium conservation and recycling worldwide.\n\nHeike Kamerlingh-Onnes discovered superconductivity in 1911, and in 1913 he was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics for his discoveries."
