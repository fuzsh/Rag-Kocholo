        "text": "On 8 April 2011 in Leiden, The Netherlands, the discovery of superconductivity by Prof. Heike Kamerlingh Onnes and his collaborators, Cornelis Dorsman, Gerrit Jan Flim, and Gilles Holst, was designated as an IEEE Milestone in Electrical Engineering and Computing. A Milestone Plaque was dedicated in the building where this discovery was made 100 years earlier to the day. The IEEE Milestones in Electrical Engineering and Computing Program honors significant technical achievements that occurred at least 25 years ago in technology areas associated with IEEE.\n\nThis Milestone was the 110th to be approved by the IEEE Board of Directors since the IEEE Milestone Program was established in 1983.\n\nThe Milestone Plaque was presented to the University of Leiden by Prof. Moshe Kam, President & CEO of the IEEE and accepted by Mr. Willem te Beest, Vice Chairman of the Executive Board of the University of Leiden. The presentation was part of an all-day celebration commemorating the discovery of superconductivity that included talks on the history of low-temperature research at Leiden, the discovery and current applications of superconductivity and prospects for future research in materials. More than two hundred scientists and engineers from around the world participated in the symposium and attended the dedication ceremony. The celebration was jointly organized and sponsored by the IEEE Council on Superconductivity, The University of Leiden, the IEEE Benelux Section, the Museum Boerhaave (Leiden), and Philips Research.\n\nSuperconductivity is one of the most startling effects in physics in which, for certain materials, the electrical resistance drops to “practically zero” for temperatures below a critical temperature, unique to each superconducting material. It was first observed on 8 April 1911 by Prof Kamerlingh Onnes and collaborators at the University of Leiden while measuring the resistance of mercury at temperatures just a few degrees above absolute zero (-273ºC). In his notebook, Prof. Kamerlingh Onnes noted that “Kwik(zilver) nagenoeg nul,” which literally translates to “mercury near enough nul”, or possibly, “mercury practically zero”, which is the more commonly accepted translation. During the past 100 years, superconductivity has been observed in more than 10,000 elements, compounds, mixtures, and alloys with the highest known transition temperature to date, of minus 100ºC. A comprehensive microscopic theory of superconductivity in metals was proposed in 1957 by John Bardeen, Leon Cooper, and Robert Schrieffer (the so-called “BCS” theory) for which they received the Nobel Prize in Physics. A total of four Nobel Prizes in Physics have been awarded to scientists for their research in superconductivity. For some additional information about superconductivity and a list of references and links please refer to the IEEE Milestone nomination form.\n\nEventually, these two plaques will be permanently mounted on an interior wall of the Kamerlingh Onnes Building which corresponds to the room in the old Kamerlingh Onnes Laboratory where the helium liquefier was located when helium was first liquefied in 1908 and where the initial experiments on superconductivity were performed on 8 April 1911, precisely 100 years before the dedication ceremony.\n\nAs a memento of this event, the IEEE Council on Superconductivity had a special coin minted from niobium, the most commonly used elemental superconducting material, to commemorate the 100th anniversary of the discovery of superconductivity and the dedication of the IEEE Milestone Plaque. On one face of the coin was the well-known plot from the Onnes paper of 1911 showing the resistance of mercury going to “practically zero” at a temperature near 4 kelvin, and on the other face was the date, location and the names of IEEE organizational units that sponsored the dedication event. A photograph of this coin is shown below.\n\nThe acquisition of the Plaques and the organizing of the events that were held April 8th was the result of the hard work by the Organizing Committee which consisted of:\n\nDr. Thomas van Beek, Faculty of Law, Leiden University\n\nProf. Dr. Dirk van Delft, Museum Boerhaave, Leiden\n\nProf. Dr. ir. Wim C. van Etten, University of Twente (retired), IEEE Benelux Section\n\nProf. Dr. Peter H. Kes, Kamerlingh Onnes Laboratorium, Leiden University\n\nDr. Martin Nisenoff, IEEE Council on Superconductivity\n\nThe proposal for the creation of an IEEE Milestone to commemorate the discovery of superconductivity was initiated by Dr. Nisenoff, the Vice President for Awards and Recognitions of the IEEE Council on Superconductivity, with support from Prof. Kes. After the Milestone had been approved by the IEEE Board of Directors in November 2010, Prof. Kes enlisted the support of Prof. van Etten, Mr. van Beek and Prof. van Delft to assist in making the necessary preparations and arrangements for the symposium and for the presentation and unveiling of the two plaques. The support from Phillips Research, including the donation of a plaque with the Dutch inscription, was invaluable to the success of this anniversary event."
