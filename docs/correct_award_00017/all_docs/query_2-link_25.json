        "text": "Photos of the Month — April 2015\n\nDutch physicist and Nobel laureate Heike Kamerlingh Onnes was born September 21st, 1853. Kamerlingh Onnes’ experiments focused on how materials reacted when cooled to nearly absolute zero. These studies led to his 1911 discovery of superconductivity. Kamerlingh Onnes served as professor of experimental physics at the University of Leiden from 1882 to 1923. In 1904, he founded a large cryogenics laboratory. He became highly regarded in the scientific community by inviting other researchers to the lab. The laboratory is now known as Kamerlingh Onnes Laboratory.\n\nA recent discovery in the photo archives revealed an album full of snapshots from daily life in the laboratory. Images depict the facilities, experimental lab equipment, and staff portraits. The images in this album reveal an amateur photographer’s experience visiting the laboratory and its staff members."
