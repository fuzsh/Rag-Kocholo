        "text": "Technology transfer activities are on the rise, but only few academic patents are bound to become a commercial success. This focus explores the challenges of protecting early-stage technology and highlights successful academic patenting strategies in the case of graphene-related inventions.\n\nThe publication of Siméon Poisson's Traité de Mécanique in 1811 represented a milestone in our understanding of the properties of materials. Two hundred years on, concepts such as Poisson's ratio continue to provide a good metric for the development of enhanced structural materials. In this focus issue we take a look at some of the latest developments in the field.\n\nOne hundred years after its discovery by Heike Kamerlingh Onnes, superconductivity is still one of the most fascinating and challenging topics in condensed-matter physics. We celebrate the anniversary with a number of editorial articles about some successful applications of superconductors and the obstacles that limit their wider use.\n\nThe supply shortages of several important chemical elements poses significant challenges for a broad range of technologies. This focus highlights the scope of the problem, ranging from motors and batteries in electric cars to fertilizers, and points towards solutions to remedy this problem.\n\nAndre Geim and Kostya Novoselov were awarded the 2010 Nobel Prize in Physics \"for groundbreaking experiments regarding the two-dimensional material graphene\". To celebrate the event, in this web focus we have gathered some of the most prominent papers on this one-atom-thick layer of graphite that Nature Materialshas published in the past four years.\n\nDiluted magnetic semiconductors and oxides are interesting for fundamental science and applications even without room-temperature ferromagnetism. In this issue we explore the progress made during the past ten years regarding the origin of ferromagnetism in (Ga,Mn)As and the search for high Curie temperatures in other systems.\n\nThe discovery of C60 — a molecular allotrope of carbon — marked a pivotal moment in the field of nanotechnology. Twenty-five years on, carbon remains the element of choice for simple but functional materials.\n\nMexico is a country rich with natural resources and an educated workforce. Yet its scientific output remains below its potential. In a focus issue we highlight some of Mexico's structural problems.\n\nAfter a quarter of a century, it is clear that the Car–Parrinello method has been ground-breaking within the field of computational materials science and has had an enormous impact on fundamental science and applications in a wide range of fields, from solid-state materials physics to chemistry and biology.\n\nDuring the past 15 years, Brazil's economy has been growing steadily, and there is No. sign that this will change any time soon. In this issue we take a closer look at how the economic growth has influenced science in the country.\n\nFifty years ago this month the first laser was demonstrated. In this focus issue we look at the history of the laser, its applications, and how to this day basic research continues to rejuvenate our understanding of the fundamental physics of the laser."
