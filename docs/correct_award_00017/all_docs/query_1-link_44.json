        "text": "Discovery of Superconductivity, 1911\n\nOn 8 April 1911, in this building, Professor Heike Kamerlingh Onnes and his collaborators, Cornelis Dorsman, Gerrit Jan Flim, and Gilles Holst, discovered superconductivity. They observed that the resistance of mercury approached \"practically zero\" as its temperature was lowered to 3 kelvins. Today, superconductivity makes many electrical technologies possible, including Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) and high-energy particle accelerators.\n\nThe plaque can be viewed mounted in the entrance hall to the Kamerlingh Onnes Building at Leiden University in Leiden, The Netherlands, which, in 1911, housed the Physical Laboratory where the phenomena of superconductivity was discovered.\n\nSuperconducting offers a class of electrical conducting materials which exhibit (near) zero electrical loss and a number of quantum mechanical properties which can result in many novel and unique electrical and electronic devices and systems.\n\nWhen a sample is in the superconducting state, which for all known superconducting elements, compounds and alloys occur at temperatures below about minus 100 C, samples can carry very large electric currents without any (or, at least, very little) Joule heating. Thus, one can build electrical machinery, large electromagnets and high current carrying power transmission cables that can operate very efficiently without any dissipation; the only energy required by these superconducting devices and systems is for the refrigeration required to maintain the device at temperatures below its critical (superconducting) transition temperature. In practice, large superconducting components, devices and systems can have overall electrical power requirements which can be two to five orders of magnitude smaller than corresponding devices and systems built using conventional resistive (and hence, dissipative) technologies.\n\nSuperconducting magnets and magnetic systems have been the enabling technology in a number of medical diagnostic applications, such as Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI), as well as most of the recent and future High Energy Physics particle accelerators such at the Large Hadron Collider at CERN (Geneva, Switzerland). The technology is also currently under evaluation for use in making the national electric power grids more energetically efficient by enabling improved power transmission, low loss power transformers and fault current limiters, etc.\n\nFor electronic applications of superconductivity, Josephson Junction devices are used in the internationally accepted voltage standard and in ultra sensitive magnetometers which have been used in geophysical exploration and in non-contacting, non-invasive magnetocardiography, magnetoencephalography, localization of focal epilepsy and cognitive neuroscience studies. Furthermore, Josephson junction technology has the potential to yield digital logic chips with clock frequencies at least an order of magnitude faster than possible with current or projected semiconductor technology.\n\nOver the years, there have been two primary impediments to the use of superconducting components, devices and systems. The first obstacle is whether the required superconductor components (wire and conductor cables, digital logic and memory cells, magnetic field sensing devices, etc., etc.) can be fabricated from superconducting materials and, then whether thy can be build at an economical fashion. (Most of the so-called High Temperature Superconductor (HTS) materials are ceramic in nature and have very complex crystallographic structures which result in very complex metallurgical properties and thus are relative difficult to form into useful configurations require for electrical and electronic applications.) The second major obstacle has been the need for a suitable cryogenic environment that is cost effective. The balance between enhanced electrical and electronic performance and the “burden:” of providing an energy-efficient and reliable cryogenic refrigeration system is very complex. In many of the instances cited above, it had been deemed advantageous to use the selected superconducting system compared to units fabricated using conventional (resistive) technologies as the performance advantage achieved by using the superconducting approach far outweighed the “cryogenic burden”.\n\nThe discovery of the phenomena of superconductivity at the University of Leiden, The Netherlands, by Prof. Heike Kamerlingh Onnes and his colleagues in 1911 was a totally unexpected result, which opened a completely new area of research in the science and technology of electrical conduction in materials and in the development of energy efficient electrical and electronic devices and systems. Prof. H. Kamerlingh Onnes and his collaborators at the University of Leiden were in a unique position as helium had first been liquefied at the University of Leiden in 1908, forwhich Prof, Kamerlingh Onnes received the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1913.\n\nUntil about 1923, the Leiden laboratory was the only research laboratory in the world where liquid helium was available, and thus where measurements could be made at temperaturesbelow about 14 K, the lowest temperature that could be reached using a liquid hydrogen bath at reduced pressures. After liquefying helium in 1908, Kamerlingh Onnes started a series of investigations which he called “Further Experiments with liquid helium” which included the investigation of the electrical properties of conductors in the temperature range below14 K.\n\nAt the beginning of the 20 th century, there were three theories for the resistance of pure metals at temperatures approaching 0 K. One theory said that the resistance of pure metals would approach zero as the temperature was lowered toward 0 K (the Drude theory), another that the resistance would flatten off and remain constant down to 0 K (theory by Matthiessen) and the third (proposed by Lord Kelvin) predicted that the resistance would increase and go toward infinity at 0 K. The choice of pure mercury for these studies was made as mercury at room temperature was a liquid and could be made very pure by repeated distillations. During their first experiments on 8 April 1911, Kamerlingh Onnes and his co-workers observed hat the resistance of the mercury sample decreased abruptly as the temperature of the helium reservoir, in which the sample was immersed, was reduced toward 3 K. At low temperatures Kamerlingh Onnes reported that the resistance of “mercury practically zero”. In subsequent experiments in May 1911, they observed that, when the mercury sample was cooled to the lowest possible temperature using a helium reservoir, the “practically zero” resistance state was again realized and that as the temperature was slowly raised, at a temperature near 4 K, the resistance of the sample abruptly reappeared, with the transition between “zero” and full resistance occurring over a very narrow temperature range, of the order of 0.1 Kelvin. These observations contradicted not only the Kelvin and Matthiessen theories, but also the Drude theory that predicted a gradual decree in resistance to zero resistance as the temperature was reduxed toward 0 K. This new state of electrical conduction at low temperatures was initially called “supraconductivity’ by Onnes.\n\nDuring the 100 years since its discovery, the phenomena of “supraconductivity” (or“superconductivity” as it was later known) has been observed in more than 10,000 elements, compounds and alloys, but, in all instances, the phenomena was always only observed at temperatures well below room temperature. The highest know superconducting transition temperatures found to date, are all below about 170 K (or about minus 100 C.). Thus a scientific study of the electrical behavior of pure metals at low temperatures by Prof. H. Kamerlingh Onnes and his colleagues lead to the totally unexpected discovery of the phenomena of superconductivity on 8 April 1911 in Room 1 the Physical Laboratory of the University of Leiden in the Netherlands.\n\nReferences and Further Reading\n\nThe initial reports on the research on superconductivity at the University of Leiden by Prof. H.
