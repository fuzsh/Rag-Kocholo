        "text": "Superconductivity is a phenomena in certain metals and ceramics where the resistivity of the material drops to zero below a certain critical temperature known as TC. These temperatures are low, with most industrial superconductors below 12 K and higher temperature ceramics just above 130K. Superconductors have widespread applications because of their properties, such as MRI machines, power lines, MagLev trains, and strong electromagnets for research.\n\nBCS Theory Mechanism\n\nTo this day the most well received theory was published in 1957 by J. Bardeen, L.N. Cooper, and J. R. Schrieffer who received a Nobel Prize in 1972. On a purely conceptual level this theory explains superconductivity as a way that electrons move through a material. Essentially, in any material two electrons can pair up with the help of a phonon, or physical/vibration wave. This is a long distance interaction and in Type I superconductors this can be around 100nm also known as the coherence length. In high temperature superconductors, this is observed as well, albeit with much shorter interaction lengths. Above the critical temperature, these appear but are quickly broken by thermal vibrations in the material. At very low temperatures the thermal vibrations are suppressed to the point where these phononic interactions can be maintained for long periods of time, and through this quantum mechanical interaction, the two electrons and the phonon form what is called a Cooper Pair.\n\nPhysically speaking, it can be imagined that in a crystalline material, a leading electron can travel through a row of atoms and the positive nuclei are attracted to the passing electron. This causes a ripple in the crystal lattice where nuclei are pulled slightly closer together, leaving a slightly positive local charge. A second electron is attracted to this local positive charge and is attracted to this area exactly cancelling out the energy lost by the electron that created this positive area.\n\nElectrons are fermions with half integer spins meaning that no two can occupy the same state at the same time, and thus interact with each other. When these two half integer spins combine in a Cooper Pair, they create an integer spin meaning that a Cooper Pair is a Boson. Bosons are allowed to occupy the same state as another boson, allowing them to pass through each other with no resistance. Another property of Cooper pairs is that the wave functions of the two electrons are phase locked, which is important to their formation.\n\nThe fact that Bosons can occupy the same state does a very interesting thing to the density of states. Based on Band Theory, in a normal metal electrons will fill up in an increasing density of state up to the Fermi level. In superconductors, the bosonic nature of the Cooper Pairs allow them to occupy lower states than before the material went through its superconducting transition temperature. The implication here is that there is an energy gap below the Fermi level in superconductors.\n\nQuestions\n\n1. What are the most common uses for superconductors and why are they important?\n\n2. What is a Cooper pair, and why is it important to superconductivity?\n\n3. What is the voltage measured from a Josephson junction oscillating at 483.6 GHz?\n\nAnswers\n\n1. Magnetic coils and research. Superconductors allow us to maintain a strong magnetic field with very little energy expenditure. In the future, high temperature superconductors could make trains, power lines and everyday devices much more efficient.\n\n2. A Cooper pair, is a pair of electrons with a phononic interaction. The electrons are phase locked and it is a boson allowing it to occupy the same state as other cooper pairs. This creates a band gap below the Fermi energy and allows resistance-free flow through a material.\n\n3. Exactly 1 volt. In fact, it is the standard for what 1 volt is.\n\nAdditional Links\n\nBand Theory\n\nResistivity\n\nBand Theory of Metals and Insulators"
