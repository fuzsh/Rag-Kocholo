Before we see the all-black cover for Smell the Glove, Bobbi Flekman says "The White Album? There was nothing on that g*dd*mn cover," thus foreshadowing the plain cover and revealing the homage.

Smell the Glove was a fictitious album but the real soundtrack LP had the same featureless black cover.

I never knew about that until your post. Thanks!

Even the CD label is a homage:

The Doom supergroup Shrinebuilder has a self-titled album that uses the weird temple from the cover of Blue Öyster Cult's Tyranny and Mutation. I was staring at it one day while playing guitar, when it kinda hit me, so I grabbed the other one and voila! Then I found an interview where Wino confirms it.

Wasn't "Satanic Majesties Request" more this album:

If so, they only had 10 or so days in which to do it...

I know, I know...release dates were very similar. However, you are aware that the boys in both bands were quite close and often in on what the others were doing well before release dates.
