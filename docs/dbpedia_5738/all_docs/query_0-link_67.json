The three award-winning journalists began their broadcast careers together in the ABC newsroom in New York. “Later in our careers, separately, Ted and Steve went on to become good friends, as did Steve and I,” recalls Crim. “It was amazing how our eulogies meshed.” Other old ABC friends from all over the country trekked to Muncie, Indiana, for two days of tributes and celebration of Steve Bell’s life and career, including David Hartman, Sam Donaldson, Charlie Gibson and Ann Compton. Steve spent the last two decades of his life teaching journalism at Ball State University. “It was a wonderful testimony to Steve and a great reunion for so many of his former ABC colleagues,” Crim continues. “RIP dear friend. Love and miss you.”\n\nTrick Trick steps up for 'Defeat the Label'\n\nOne thing Detroit-based rapper and musical artist Trick Trick doesn’t put up with is bullying.
