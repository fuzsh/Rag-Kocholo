        "text": "A new advertisement, this one for a brand of snacks for kids, has been placed over the landmark Robert Wyland whale mural that the Michigan artist painted on the Broderick Tower in downtown Detroit more than 25 years ago.\n\nThe controversy over whether the artwork should be covered up by advertisements at all has been ongoing for years, but surged in late August — and again this week — after thunderstorms destroyed a large, vinyl Rocket Companies ad featuring artwork by local artist Phillip Simpson, revealing the mural behind it.\n\nAt the time, the artist asked in a social media post: \"What happens now?\"\n\nSimpson apparently got his answer: His smiley-face ad design came down to briefly reveal the whales, and this week, WXYZ-TV (Channel 7) reported, a new ad — for Oscar Mayer Lunchable Dunkables — covered up the mural once again.\n\nDetroiters, lawmakers and lawyers have debated for years how to handle public murals, which have artistic and historic significance, and whether they should be — or legally can be — covered up. The Visual Artists Rights Act of 1990 granted artists some rights, but they are still being tested in the courts.\n\nMore: Detroit's whale mural returns to Broderick Tower after storm damages ad that covered it\n\nRepresentatives for Broderick Tower, with its neoclassical architecture, told the Free Press on Wednesday it rents apartments, offices and space for advertisements to another company. It notes on its website it \"first pierced the skyline of Detroit in 1928 at Grand Circus,\" and is at \"the epicenter of Agustus Woodward’s hub and spoke street plan.\"\n\nLast year, Wyland sought to take the issue to the Michigan Supreme Court. The mural, which depicts swimming whales, is public art, but also reminds Detroiters that, despite being miles and miles away from the ocean, it is still connected to the sea and has a role in protecting whales.\n\nWyland, a Michigan native and conservationist, has painted life-size whale murals worldwide. His interest in whales began as a teen and he has a gallery that sells licensed merchandise. His work has been featured on license plates, United Nations stamps and a cruise ship.\n\nWyland painted the 20-story mural on the back of the 34-story Broderick Tower, making it highly visible in Comerica Park by Detroit Tigers fans and TV cameras broadcasting games. Since 2006, the Wyland mural has been covered by various ads, leading to a public outcry.\n\nWyland filed a brief with the high court last year arguing that covering it was a violation of federal law, and told WDIV-TV (Channel 4) that he was disappointed Rocket Mortgage would consider \"destroying the integrity of a work of art that is loved by so many.\"\n\nAnother issue he raised, WXYZ reported, was historic preservation tax credits.\n\nIn August, Wyland issued a statement to the Free Press through Steve Creech, president of the Wyland Foundation, calling the storm damage to the ad ironic.\n\nHe added: \"After years of contention, soda ads, car ads, appeals to the state supreme court, and Rocket Mortgage completely disregarding any communication with us to find another building for their ad instead of covering up a legacy work of public art, it finally took Mother Nature to step in and say, 'Let me handle this.' \"\n\nStill, perhaps, for those who now know the story behind the whale mural and the advertising, the new ad also offers a new, unintended message: If there isn't more of an effort to protect them, the world's whales, like those on the mural, can be blotted out.\n\nContact Frank Witsil: 313-222-5022 or fwitsil@freepress.com.
