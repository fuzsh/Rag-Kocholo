        "text": "In the garden of success, community is the water that nurtures growth. 🌱🤝 Today, we're focusing on the power of community engagement and how it can transform your brand. Building a community isn't just about gathering followers; it's about cultivating meaningful connections and creating a space where everyone feels valued and heard. To our family of entrepreneurs, we encourage you to engage with your community in ways that matter. Host Q&A sessions, share user-generated content, or create challenges that inspire participation. Every interaction is an opportunity to strengthen bonds and foster loyalty. What initiatives have you taken to engage and grow your community? Share your experiences and tips. Your insights could spark inspiration for someone else! #TogetherWeGrow #CommunityEngagement #BrandCommunity\n\nA lot of coaches and gurus out there don't want you to know this, but I'm spilling the beans... There are no quick-fixes. No hacks, either. (Sorry.) The only quick-fix for your sales is to learn the actual strategies and tools that work for YOU and YOUR dream clients. And then implementing them. Then you'll start seeing results. Then your revenue will start growing. Then sales becomes easy and effortless and aligned. So save your money. Don't spend it on another quick-fix or hacky investment. It's not going to work unless you do THE WORK. PS. Want to get better at sales and have community, accountability and support as you do the work? The She Sells membership is open to founding members for $11/mo through June 18th. In 2.5 weeks, the women inside have already made moves and seen results. DM me for details and founding member bonuses :) #SorryNotSorry #DoTheWork\n\nAt the beginning of this year, I had a vision. I’d spent 5 months networking hard in London & was worried to leave 😖 Landing back in Tel Aviv 7 weeks ago, I knew the same networking opportunities weren’t available to me 😳 🧨 I wanted in-person connections. 🧨 I wanted to meet fellow business owners. 🧨 I wanted to build a biz community in the city I call home. So I solved my own problem. 5 weeks ago, Hannah Shtein and I started our own in-person community for English-speaking female entrepreneurs 💃🏻 It grew fast. We have over 400 awesome women inside the community. Today we’re holding out 5th meet-up 🚀 🔥 Next Sunday we’re hosting our first proper event & speaking with local press to cover it. 🔥 We’re having conversations to build this out as a wider PR piece. 🔥 We’re speaking with investors & benefactors to get funding. 🔥 We’re hiring a Brand Partnerships Manager. This has ALL been possible because we KNEW what the vision was and we have a clear vision around our goals 🎯 THIS is how we’ve been able to move forward at lightning pace and execute with precision ⚡️ Because we’re clear on: 🌈 The big 2024 vision. 🌈 What successful Q2 looks like to us. 🌈 What action we need to take each week to move us forwards and hit our goals. When YOU have this level of clarity, you’re also able to: 🦄 Move forwards effortlessly towards your big goals 🦄 Remove the stress & overwhelm of what to do and when 🦄 Get excited about what’s to come cos you have an actual plan to get there Next week, I’m announcing a brand new low-investment offer that is helping you solve this exact problem 👀 If you wanna start getting excited about your business because you know exactly WHAT the plan is and HOW to move forwards effortlessly to hit all your goals, this one’s for you 😉 Don’t look away now 👀 What have you been up to this weekend?🥳 I was at a friend’s brunch yesterday then watched Arsenal SLAY Brighton 3-0 #coyg 😎"
