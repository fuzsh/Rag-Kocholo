        "text": "When I was a kid my mom used to decorate the house for Halloween in such a way that some kids didn’t dare come up the driveway. She had special effects and large dangling spiders and, eventually, my step-father hiding in a pauper’s coffin next to the front porch to scare the trick-or-treaters. What I remember most, or I should say terrified/thrilled me the most, was this Ghostly Sounds album on the Peter Pan record label that came out in 1975. My mom acquired this LP, most likely at Peaches (remember Peaches? Done by a former Disney animator named George Peed, the Ghostly Sounds artwork looks nothing like all the other gentle covers he illustrated for Peter Pan records.\n\nNo idea of the origin or who these stewardesses are, but I’m going to call them, from left to right, Bev, Carol, Inez and Judy. And, if I had to guess, based on the fashion, the hair and the pattern on the seat upholstery, “back when” is about 1977ish. And back then, if there was room in first class, that’s where they’d seat you. As for the upholstery on those seats, I absolutely remember that red and blue abstract pattern. Well, this has been a fun trip down memory lane but it’s time to put your tray tables up and prepare for departure.\n\nThe weather has started to cool down and it’s almost time to start hunkering down! It’s officially time to start looking for new fun and challenging things to do with our time at home. And one of my new favorite activities is to create my favorite restaurant dishes at home. There are recipes galore all over the internet and just as many YouTube tutorials with step-by-step instructions on how to create restaurant dupes in your very own kitchen. My latest accomplishment is orange chicken--very close to the kind you’d get at an Asian restaurant.\n\nEven though you may already be missing the summer months, its time to get excited for fall. This is a favorite time of year for many people and theres good reason why. So, heres to leaves changing color, cider mills and long walks in crisp air! Kila - As much as I love hanging by the lake, or the hot summer days, I absolutely love the fall season. We may not have college football, but I am still down for a good tailgate too.\n\nEven though things are very different now, here are my top three things I remember most fondly about back to school time. 1 - New school supplies! I still get excited when Im in a Staples looking for grown up school supplies (theyre now referred to as office supplies). It was always great to hear about what my school friends did over the summer and build new memories during the school year. I hope you have a great school year whether your family is starting this week or next!\n\nIt's funny how during this time I've picked up one of the hobbies I never could imagine was an option for me. Not to say that I've \"mastered\" this hobby, not even close - but that's the goal. If you’re unfamiliar with my background, I’ve successfully killed succulents, Jade Trees and cacti. But that’s all behind me now... what I lack in natural ability I will make up for with effort and education. With the help of advice from good friends and YouTube University, I will make it to be my goal of having a mini jungle in my apartment.\n\nJason Carr - When I was a kid we went to the drive-in. We always brought our snacks so the concession stand was doubly tempting during intermission. I was never asleep when the second movie would start so I saw age-inappropriate content such as Death Race and Obsession. The Thing, Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan, National Lampoons Vacation, Blue Thunder, Jason and the Argonauts... If youre going to the drive-in, dont forget your snacks and... mask up!\n\nTati Amare - Summer sun is blazing and we’re all enjoying the sunshine and long days as best as we can. With so much going on around us it’s hard to take it all in sometimes, but I’m determined to squeeze every bit of enjoyment out of this season and life, for that matter. My goal is to focus on my family, friends, my community and all the things that make my life rich. I’ve said before that social distancing in better weather is the saving grace in this transition, so let’s make a strong effort to enjoy it. Take the first step and you’ll be amazed at how much beauty is around us and how much there is to be grateful for!"
