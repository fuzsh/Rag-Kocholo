        "text": "DETROIT – Neighbors near the Dexter Avenue corridor on Detroit’s west side are witnessing the community’s transformation as the Dexter Streetscape Project occurs.\n\nDetroit is improving along Dexter Avenue, between Davison Avenue and Webb Street. As the construction continues, city staff announced it would be hosting in-person office hours at a local business in that area.\n\n“I think everybody is excited about what’s going on and what they’re seeing,” said Keyona Barnes, owner of In Harmony Café.\n\nNew sidewalks are being installed, and street improvements are being made outside the local coffee shop. Workers and neighbors are excited about what’s to come.\n\nBarnes said, “I am so excited because when we got here back in ‘21, we had naysayers saying that could never happen again on Dexter. It always was. But now it is. And it will be. So, I’m excited about that.”\n\nThe Dexter Avenue Streetscape Project will include various improvements. In addition to new sidewalks and streets, improved lighting, new trees and landscaping, murals, and façade improvements will help make the Dexter Avenue corridor safer and more walkable.\n\n“I think Dexter Avenue has been one of the most exciting streetscapes that we’ve done in recent history,” said Jay Biernat, Program Manager for Streetscapes in Detroit.\n\nHe and his city of Detroit staff are hosting the in-person office hours at In Harmony Café.\n\n“This is close to people’s homes,” Biernat said. “This is right in the footprint of the streetscape that goes from Davison to Webb. And people know this space. And they feel safe to come in here. We want to come to where people are so that if they have questions, inquiries, or problems that need to be solved, they can come to us. We can pull up plans or schedules and help them solve their problems.”\n\nThe Dexter Streetscape Office Hours are Mondays from 9 a.m. to 10 a.m. and Wednesdays from 1 p.m. to 2 p.m. at In Harmony Café, located at 12041 Dexter Ave., Detroit, MI 48206, through October 2024."
