David Powell of Northfield Township police said three people were dead at the scene and three survivors were rushed to medical facilities in unknown condition Saturday afternoon. One of those survivors later died, police said.\n\nMore information about the victims, including their ages and relationship to each other, was still being determined, Powell said during an evening news conference.\n\nThe single-family home, which was fairly isolated and on a dead-end road, was destroyed save for its basement, according to police and reporting from NBC affiliate WDIV of Detroit.\n\nDamage was not reported at other locations, Powell said.\n\nDebris from the blast, which was reported at 3:20 p.m., was found at a residence on the other side of a roadway, he said.\n\nAsked about the cause, Powell said, \"We don't know, maybe some type of gas explosion.\"\n\nHe said he believes the homes in the area are not connected to utility gas lines and rely on propane tanks for fuel.\n\nElectricity to the area was cut off as a precaution, and portable lighting was being brought in so investigators, including a medical examiner, could work through the night, Powell said.\n\nNorthfield Township is about 50 miles west of Detroit."
