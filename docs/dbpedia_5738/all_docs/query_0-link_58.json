I will be recording, but this will be my last year in concert. This is it.”\n\nFranklin said she’s “exuberant” about recording the album with Wonder, which will feature only original songs and is planned for a September release. She won’t completely stop performing either, but will continue to do “some select things, maybe one a month, for six months out of the year.”\n\nFranklin said a primary reason for her retirement is to spend more time with her grandchildren."
