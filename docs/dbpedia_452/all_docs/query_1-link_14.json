Youâll want your son to have a name that resonates with you, such as one whose meaning appeals to you or one that's connected with your family's heritage or culture. And youâll want to choose a name that will stand the test of time, whether that's something cool or cute, modern or traditional, or something that connotes strength and vigor. The Filipino culture has a wide array of wonderful names to consider for your son. Learn more about the history behind Filipino names and check out our list of the 10 most common Filipino boy names as well 140 more.\n\nFilipino Naming Culture\n\nThe country known as the Republic of the Philippines historically has over 186 languages, with the two chief languages in the archipelago nation being English and Filipino, the modern standard of the Tagalog language. Filipino is an Austronesian language, among which are Indonesian (Malay) and Javanese, and other Pacific Island languages.\n\nSpain ruled the Philippines for over 300 years as a colony and as a result had a strong influence on Filipino culture. Then in 1898, the nation of 7,641 islands became part of the United States, only gaining independence in 1946. American pop culture continues to have a strong influence on the Philippines to this day.\n\nFor all these reasons, Filipino naming culture is quite varied, which is why youâll find names with Christian, Spanish, and American origins mixed with native Filipino names as well as modern Filipino names cleverly created from this unique past. Our list of Filipino names for boys reflects this diverse background of the nation.\n\nPopular Filipino Boy Names\n\nWondering what is a popular Filipino boy name?
