        "text": "If you have a health condition caused by exposure to the herbicide Agent Orange during your service, you may be eligible for VA disability compensation. Compensation provides tax-free monthly payments. Keep reading to find out if you may be eligible.\n\nAm I eligible for VA disability compensation?\n\nYou may be eligible for VA disability compensation based on Agent Orange exposure if you meet both of these requirements.\n\nBoth of these must be true:\n\nYou have a health condition that’s caused by exposure to Agent Orange, and\n\nYou served in a location that exposed you to Agent Orange\n\nKeep reading for the full eligibility requirements.\n\nNote: If you get a disability rating, you may also be eligible for VA health care and other benefits.\n\nFull eligibility requirements\n\nWe determine eligibility based on the facts of each Veteran’s claim. But we assume (or “presume”) that certain cancers and other illnesses are caused by Agent Orange. We call these presumptive conditions. And we assume that Veterans who served in certain locations were exposed to Agent Orange. We refer to this as presumptive exposure.\n\nNew PACT Act-related presumptive conditions and locations\n\nWe’ve added 2 new Agent Orange presumptive conditions based on the PACT Act:\n\nHigh blood pressure (also called hypertension)\n\nMonoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance (MGUS)\n\nWe’ve also added 5 new Agent Orange presumptive locations. Keep reading to learn about these new locations.\n\nRequirements for Agent Orange presumptive diseases\n\nWe consider a condition presumptive when it’s established by law or regulation. If you’ve been diagnosed with one of these conditions, you don’t need to prove that it started during—or got worse because of—your military service.\n\nCancers caused by Agent Orange exposure\n\nBladder cancer\n\nChronic B-cell leukemia\n\nHodgkin’s disease\n\nMultiple myeloma\n\nNon-Hodgkin’s lymphoma\n\nProstate cancer\n\nRespiratory cancers (including lung cancer)\n\nSome soft tissue sarcomas\n\nNote: We don’t include osteosarcoma, chondrosarcoma, Kaposi’s sarcoma, or mesothelioma on our list of presumptive conditions.\n\nOther illnesses caused by Agent Orange exposure\n\nAL amyloidosis\n\nChloracne (or other types of acneiform disease like it)\n\nNote: Under our rating regulations, this condition must be at least 10% disabling within 1 year of herbicide exposure.\n\nDiabetes mellitus type 2\n\nHigh blood pressure (hypertension)\n\nHypothyroidism\n\nIschemic heart disease\n\nMonoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance (MGUS)\n\nParkinsonism\n\nParkinson’s disease\n\nPeripheral neuropathy, early onset\n\nNote: Under our rating regulations, this condition must be at least 10% disabling within 1 year of herbicide exposure.\n\nPorphyria cutanea tarda\n\nNote: Under our rating regulations, this condition must be at least 10% disabling within 1 year of herbicide exposure.\n\nIf you have a cancer or illness that’s not on our list of presumptive conditions, but you believe it was caused by Agent Orange exposure, you can still file a claim for VA disability benefits. But you’ll need to submit more evidence. Keep reading to learn about service requirements and supporting evidence.\n\nService requirements for presumption of exposure\n\nWe base eligibility for VA disability compensation benefits, in part, on whether you served in a location that exposed you to Agent Orange. We call this having a presumption of exposure.\n\nYou have a presumption of exposure if you meet at least one of these service requirements.\n\nBetween January 9, 1962, and May 7, 1975, you must have served for any length of time in at least one of these locations:\n\nIn the Republic of Vietnam, or\n\nAboard a U.S. military vessel that operated in the inland waterways of Vietnam, or\n\nOn a vessel operating not more than 12 nautical miles seaward from the demarcation line of the waters of Vietnam and Cambodia\n\nOr you must have served in at least one of these locations that we’ve added based on the PACT Act:\n\nAny U.S. or Royal Thai military base in Thailand from January 9, 1962, through June 30, 1976, or\n\nLaos from December 1, 1965, through September 30, 1969, or\n\nCambodia at Mimot or Krek, Kampong Cham Province from April 16, 1969, through April 30, 1969, or\n\nGuam or American Samoa or in the territorial waters off Guam or American Samoa from January 9, 1962, through July 31, 1980, or\n\nJohnston Atoll or on a ship that called at Johnston Atoll from January 1, 1972, through September 30, 1977\n\nOr at least one of these must be true for you:\n\nYou served in or near the Korean DMZ for any length of time between September 1, 1967, and August 31, 1971, or\n\nYou served on active duty in a regular Air Force unit location where a C-123 aircraft with traces of Agent Orange was assigned, and had repeated contact with this aircraft due to your flight, ground, or medical duties, or\n\nYou were involved in transporting, testing, storing, or other uses of Agent Orange during your military service, or\n\nYou were assigned as a Reservist to certain flight, ground, or medical crew duties at one of the locations listed here\n\nEligible Reserve locations, time periods, and units include:\n\nLockbourne/Rickenbacker Air Force Base in Ohio, 1969 to 1986 (906th and 907th Tactical Air Groups or 355th and 356th Tactical Airlift Squadrons)\n\nWestover Air Force Base in Massachusetts, 1972 to 1982 (731st Tactical Air Squadron and 74th Aeromedical Evacuation Squadron, or 901st Organizational Maintenance Squadron)\n\nPittsburgh International Airport in Pennsylvania, 1972 to 1982 (758th Airlift Squadron)\n\nFor more service requirement details, review these sources:\n\nPublic Law 116-23 (Blue Water Navy Vietnam Veterans Act of 2019) on Congress.gov\n\nAir Force specialty codes and units for affected C-123 aircraft (PDF)\n\nDates and locations of herbicide tests and storage outside Vietnam (VA public health website)\n\nHow to get disability benefits for Agent Orange-related claims\n\nHow do I file a claim for compensation?\n\nIf you haven’t filed a claim yet for the presumptive condition\n\nYou can file a new claim online now.
