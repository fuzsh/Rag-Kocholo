        "text": "Hawaii Elections\n\nHawaii conducts statewide elections in even-numbered years. The primary election is held on the second Saturday in August and the general election is held on the first Tuesday after the first Monday in November.\n\nView the election calendar for dates and deadlines.\n\nPursuant to Act 136, SLH 2019, elections are conducted by mail. All registered voters automatically receive their ballot in the mail approximately eighteen (18) days prior to the election. Ballots are sent to the mailing address provided with the voter's voter registration. To register or update your voter registration, visit Voter Registration.\n\nPrimary Election\n\nThe primary election nominates candidates to represent political parties in the general election. Similarly, candidates who do not belong to a political party will be nominated to the general election by meeting the qualifications as a nonpartisan candidate running in a partisan contest.\n\nHawaii voters do not declare a political affiliation with the voter registration pursuant to the Hawaii State Constitution, ensuring every voter's right to secrecy. On the primary election ballot, voters must first select a political affiliation and then vote for candidates of the political affiliation of their choice only.\n\nVoters may also vote for candidates for the Office of Hawaiian Affairs and county contests regardless of party affiliation.\n\nGeneral Election\n\nThe general election is a candidate contest, meaning that voters may vote for the candidate of their choice regardless of political affiliation. Voters will select federal, state, county, and Office of Hawaiian Affairs candidates, as well as State Constitutional Amendments and/or Charter Amendments.\n\nPresidential Elections\n\nHawaii does not conduct a presidential preference primary. The political parties independently conduct presidential caucuses to nominate candidates for president and vice-president. For information on how to participate in the party-run presidential caucuses, contact the qualified political parties directly. The Electoral College elects the president and vice-president of the United States. Learn more about the Electoral College.\n\nRanked-Choice Voting\n\nAny federal election not held on the date of a regularly scheduled primary or general election and any special election for a vacant seat on a county council shall be conducted by ranked-choice voting. HRS § 11-100.\n\nWhat is ranked-choice voting?\n\nRanked-choice voting\" is the method of casting and tabulating votes in which voters rank candidates in order of preference, tabulation proceeds in sequential rounds in which last-place candidates are defeated, and the candidate with the most votes in the final round is elected.\" HRS §§ 11-110(e).\n\nSpecific statutory procedures are followed in each round. HRS §§ 11-110(b)-(d).\n\nHow does ranked-choice voting work?\n\nIf a candidate receives a majority of votes, 50 percent plus one, in the first round, that candidate wins. However, if no candidate receives a majority of votes, the votes of the defeated candidate(s) are redistributed.\n\nIn each round, the candidate with the lowest number of votes is defeated. Those votes are then redistributed as votes for the continuing candidates, counting for the voter’s next ranked candidate in the following round.\n\nThis process of redistributing votes continues until a candidate reaches a majority of the votes.\n\nRegistering to Vote\n\nTo register to vote in the State of Hawaii, you must be:\n\nA U.S. Citizen\n\nA resident of Hawaii\n\nAt least sixteen (16) years old.\n\nHawaii law allows qualified individuals to pre-register at sixteen (16) years of age.
