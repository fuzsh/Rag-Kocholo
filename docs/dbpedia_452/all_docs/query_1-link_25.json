        "text": "passport\n\nUnder Republic Act No. 8239 or The Philippine Passport Act of 1996, a Philippine passport is a document issued by the Philippine Government to its citizens requesting other governments to allow its citizens to pass freely, and in case of need, to give them lawful aid and protection.\n\nThe Philippines has instituted the electronic passport (ePassport) system for all its citizens. The ePassport features microchip technology and a host of other security features thereby ensuring that Philippine passports are virtually tamper-proof. ePassport issuance is also compliant with the security standards set by the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO). The Philippine ePassport has an integrated circuit (chip) within its pages containing data that are essential in verifying the identity of the passport holder. These include the personal biographical information found on the data page of the passport, the biometrics of the passport holder, the unique chip identification number, and a digital signature to verify the authenticity of the data stored on the chip. The chip technology allows the information stored in an ePassport to be read by special chip readers at almost every international port of entry.\n\nPassport Requirements\n\nBASIC REQUIREMENTS FOR FIRST TIME APPLICANT (18 years old and above)\n\nPrinted Passport Application Packet with bar code.\n\nOriginal and one (1) photocopy of PSA-authenticated Birth Certificate or Report of Birth issued by the Philippine Consulate General New York (if born abroad).

The fraudulent acquisition, loss or destruction of the Passport is a crime punishable under the law, with penalties stipulated under RA 8239. The Consular Officer is authorized to determine if the applicant can apply for a passport, and what documentary evidence must be presented.\n\nWho can issue a Philippine passport?\n\nOnly the Secretary of Foreign Affairs or any of his authorized consular officers may issue a Philippine passport\n\nWho can apply for a Philippine passport?\n\nOnly citizens of the Republic of the Philippines are entitled to a Philippine passport.\n\nFormer Filipino Nationals who are naturalized citizens of foreign countries are no longer entitled to use or renew their Philippine passports, having lost their Philippine citizenship (Commonwealth Act No. 63 of 1936)\n\nThose who have acquired foreign citizenship by naturalization but have reacquired Philippine citizenship upon taking the oath of allegiance to the Republic of the Philippines in accordance with R.A. 9225 the “Citizenship Retention and Re-acquisition Act of 2003″ may apply for Philippine passports, if they satisfy the requirements of R.A. 8239 “The Philippine Passport Law”\n\nIn the interest of national security, public safety and public health, a consular officer may refuse to issue a passport, restrict its use, withdraw or cancel a passport.\n\nIn view of the need to determine an applicant’s current citizenship, a consular officer may require an applicant to present a valid document of foreign residency i.e., a US Permanent Resident Card, US Visa, INS notice, etc.\n\nDoes immigration status in the US matter when I am applying for a passport?\n\nNo matter what your status is here in the US, you can apply for a Philippine Passport, provided that you can show us that:\n\nYou are who you say you are – Proof of Identity\n\nYou are still a Filipino citizen – Proof of Citizenship\n\nWhat the Consulate verifies is the truth of the Oath signed by all passport applicants, which says:\n\n“I solemnly swear under penalty of law that I am a Filipino; I am the person in the attached photograph; the thumbprints on this form are mine, I have never made false representations in any of my passport applications; the statements made on this Application Form are true and correct; and the attached supporting documents are authentic.”\n\nHow long does it take to process a Philippine passport?\n\nAll passports are printed by the Department of Foreign Affairs in Manila. Regular passport applications received from Philippine Embassies/Consulates will be available from four (4) to six (6) weeks from the date of application. Applicants are advised to plan trips or interviews where they will need valid passports only after receiving the new passport.\n\nIs it mandatory to renew my expired passport even though I have no plans to travel anytime soon?\n\nNo. You may renew your expired passport any time you wish.\n\nHowever, we strongly recommend that you should have a valid passport with at least seven to eight (7-8) months validity prior to making any travel plans.\n\nWhat are the new photo requirements for the ePassport?\n\nNo passport photo is required. Your photo will be taken digitally by our Data Encoders during the passport application enrollment step. Please note of the following tips for posing during photo capturing :\n\nStraight frontal shot (no tilting of head)\n\n“Medium” smile (no teeth showing)\n\nCollared shirt/decent attire\n\nBoth ears visible/both eyebrows visible (no bangs)\n\nHead scarf/veil for religious or health reasons allowed\n\nImage can be rejected for the following reasons:\n\nDistorted image – head is tilted or smile is too wide\n\nWomen – excessive makeup, large earrings\n\nMen – wearing makeup, earrings\n\nColored contact lenses that disguise the natural color of the applicant’s eyes. Clear contact lenses however, are allowed.\n\nUse of headgear other than scarf/veil for religious or health reasons\n\nUse of eyeglasses/shades\n\nPoor photo quality/poor or uneven lighting\n\nHow do I change or amend data on my passport?\n\nThe applicant is advised to present documents to justify the need to change/amend data found on his/her passport. The Consular Officer reserves the right to require further proof. Applicant is further advised that implementing changes/amendments may not be carried out immediately, but may require corresponding with the Philippine Statistics Authority.\n\nIs it be possible to keep my current passport “uncancelled” while the new one is being processed?\n\nThe Consulate will not cancel a passport as long as it is valid. The applicant is only required to present it to Consulate for cancellation once the new passport arrives. Once cancelled, the old passport will also be returned to the applicant.\n\nWhat is the validity of a Philippine passport?\n\nIn accordance with Department Order No. 010-2017 or the Implementing Rules and Regulations (IRR) of Republic Act No. 10928 (2017), the Philippine passport has a ten-year validity period, for those issued to Filipinos 18 years or older. Filipinos under 18 years will still be issued five-year valid passports.\n\nCan additional pages be inserted in the passport if it has ran out of pagess?\n\nNo. The Philippine passport has a standard booklet containing forty-four (44) pages. Should the passport run out of pages, you need to renew your passport.\n\nI applied for a passport before but never claimed it. Do I need to declare it?\n\nYes. You may request for a Certificate of Unclaimed Passport from DFA-Aseana or the concerned Consular Office or Philippine Embassy/Consulate, and submit this certification together with your application.\n\nMy passport's validity is less than 6 months. Can I still use it to travel abroad?\n\nNo. Your passport must be at least six-months valid for you to be able to travel abroad.\n\nHowever, Filipinos who are currently abroad may travel back to the Philippines even if their passport are less than 6-months valid.\n\nI have valid foreign visas on my old passport. Should I have it transferred to my new one?\n\nNo. Expired and Renewed passports do not affect the validity of the foreign visas. However, you must bring your old passport with valid visas along with your new passport when travelling. When in doubt, consult the Foreign Embassy that issued your visa.\n\nI have printed visas with me. Can I staple it on my passport?\n\nNo. Stapling documents, especially on the covers, and putting unnecessary designs or accessories may damage the passport or which might damage the chip and make the ePassport invalid.\n\nUpon claiming my passport, I realized that my name was misspelled. What shall I do?\n\nBefore leaving the consular office, make sure that you check the details of your new passport carefully. If the details on your passport are incorrect, such as your name, sex or date of birth, you may reapply for a passport and pay the regular passport fee of $60.00."
