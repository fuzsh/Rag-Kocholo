        "text": "There are four steps or processes in registering to National ID system:\n\n1. Go to any registration centers and bring your supporting documents. Registration Centers can be found at the following sites:\n\nPSA Regional and Provincial Office\n\nMalls\n\nLocal Government Units (LGUs)\n\nFor the list of National ID Registration Centers, click below:\n\nThe PSA also conducts mobile registration in far-flung areas via:\n\nPhilSys on Wheels\n\nPhilSys on Boat\n\nPresent your supporting documents to the Registration Kit Operator (RKO).\n\nFor the list of supporting documents, click below:\n\n2. Have your demographic data validated, and your biometric information such as fingerprint, iris-scan, and front-facing photograph captured.\n\n3. Review and confirm your demographic and biometric information.\n\n4. You will be issued a transaction slip containing your transaction reference number (TRN). Keep your transaction slip, as your TRN can be used to track your National ID delivery and your ePhilID availability.\n\nNote: The ePhilID can also be obtained immediately after registering to the National ID system if it is confirmed that there is no duplicate or discrepancy in the personal information provided.\n\nCurrently, the use of National ID Authentication services is free of charge to those companies/agencies who underwent onboarding with National ID system. In the long run, for sustainability purposes, if any fees are introduced by PSA, they will be minimal to avoid hindering adoption. Such fees are expected to be lower than the savings Relying Parties will gain by digitizing their processes, including onboarding. Nonetheless, PSA remains committed to offering these services to the government for free.\n\nThe possibility of charging fees will only apply to the onboarded Relying Parties from the Private Sector.\n\nAs provided under Republic Act 11055 or the Philippine Identification System Act, the National ID and the ePhilID shall be recognized as a valid proof of identity in transactions with public and private establishments; non-acceptance of the National ID without just and sufficient cause is subject to fines amounting to Php 500,000.00.\n\nPlease provide the following details of the non-acceptance of your National ID or your ePhilID to our official email at info@philsys.gov.ph:\n\nDate of the transaction;\n\nName, branch, and address of the establishment;\n\nNature of transaction; and\n\nReason/s provided by the establishment for its refusal to accept the National ID in the transaction.\n\nPSA takes reports of non-acceptance seriously and continuously reminds government agencies and private institutions to recognize the National ID and its digital versions as valid proof of identification.\n\nIn compliance with the Data Privacy Act of 2012, all information provided will remain confidential and solely be used for the processing of requests."
