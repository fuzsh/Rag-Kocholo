Even before the Spanish American War, Filipinos were fighting for their independence from colonial powers. The Philippine Revolution took place between August 1896 and June 1898. The Filipino Declaration of Independence was modeled directly on the American Declaration of Independence. Dolan 1993: 24-26; McKinley 1898.\n\n[3] Gingerich 2020; Mydan 2022; Torres 2021. Following the United States Military Government of the Philippine Islands, the US government established the Insular Government of the Philippine Islands – a civil government, led by William Howard Taft (who became US President in 1909). The Philippine Organic Act of 1902, passed by the US Congress, set the basic laws and government structure for the Philippines, including the removal of the Catholic Church as the state religion and extending the US Bill of Rights to Filipinos. This ended the Philippine-American War. President Roosevelt (who took office after McKinley’s assassination) gave full pardon and amnesty to all Filipinos who had taken part. In 1935, the Commonwealth of the Philippines was established, designed as a transitional step to full independence. During World War II, the Philippines was a commonwealth of the United States. The Philippines became an independent country on July 4, 1946 via the Treaty of Manila, when the US recognized the independent Republic of the Philippines. Dolan 1993: 27-29; 38-39; 41-43; Roosevelt 1935; Truman 1946.\n\n[4] Limos 2019.\n\n[5] Mydans 2022. The building Maria studied in was originally constructed as the Fine Arts Pavilion for the 1909 Alaska-Yukon-Pacific Exposition. Afterwards, it was repurposed as the “Chem Shack.” Officially called Bagley Hall at the time, it housed the chemistry and pharmacy labs and classrooms that Maria would have been familiar with. The building is now known as Architecture Hall. Heritage professionals have evaluated the building as eligible for the National Register of historic places (Grey et al. 2017).\n\n[6] Gingerich 2020; Mydans 2022; Orosa 1998: vi; Torres 2021.\n\n[7] Orosa 1998: vii.\n\n[8] Maria was the first person to freeze and can mangoes, making them available to worldwide markets.

The date that the Japanese attack began in the Philippines was December 8, 1941, even though the attack was just a few hours after Pearl Harbor on December 7, 1941. The International Date Line is the reason events in the Philippines seem to take place a day later than in the continental United States.\n\n[15] Orosa del Rosario 1998: ii.\n\n[16] Cigarette Pack Collectors’ Association 2008.\n\n[17] Orosa 1998: ix.\n\n[18] Mydans 2022; Orosa 1998: ix; Sabillo 2020.\n\n[19] Orosa 1998: ix.\n\n[20] Del Rosario Garcia and Orosa 2019; Sabillo 2020.\n\n[21] Mydans 2022; Sabillo 2020.\n\n[22] Cayabyab 2020; Lariosa 2022; Sabillo 2020.
