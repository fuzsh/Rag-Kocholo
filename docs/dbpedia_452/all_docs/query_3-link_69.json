AGUINALDO IN EXILE FILIPINO EXILES IN HONG KONG Emilio Aguinaldo led 36 other revolutionary leaders into exile in the British colony. They were: Pedro Aguinaldo Tomas Aguinaldo Joaquin Alejandrino Celestino Aragon Jose Aragon Primitivo Artacho Vito Belarmino Agapito Bonzon Antonio Carlos Eugenio dela Cruz Agustin Dela Rosa Gregorio H. del Pilar Lino Viola Valentin Diaz Salvador Estrella Vitaliano Famular Dr. Anastacio Francisco Pedro Francisco Francisco Frani Maximo Kabigting Vicente Kagton Silvestre Legaspi Teodoro Legaspi Mariano Llanera Doroteo Lopez Vicente Lukban Lazaro Makapagal Miguel Malvar Tomas Mascardo Antonio Montenegro Benito Natividad Carlos Ronquillo Manuel Tinio Miguel Valenzuela Wenceslao Viniegra Escolastico Viola\n\n3. BATTLE OF MANILA BAY SPANISH-AMERICAN WAR DATE: May 1 1898 RESULT: U. S. Victory BELLIGERENTS: United States and Kingdom of Spain COMMANDERS: George Dewey and Patricio Montojo LOCATION: Near Manila, Philippines\n\n4. BATTLE OF MANILA BAY SPANISH-AMERICAN WAR INTRODUCTION 25 April 1898, US declared war on Spain following the sinking of Battleship Main on 15 Feb 1898 Considered as the FIRST MAJOR ENGAGEMENT of the Spanish-American War One of the most DECISIVE NAVAL BATTLES in history War ended with the signing of Treaty of Paris on 10 December 1898\n\n5. BATTLE OF MANILA BAY SPANISH-AMERICAN WAR BACKGROUND 1492, Spain was the first European nation to sail westward across the Atlantic Ocean, explore and colonize nations on the Western Hemisphere Amongst their colonies back then, Cuba was the first to initiate a struggle for independence Commodore George Dewey sailed from Hong Kong \"You may fire when ready, Gridley“ The Spanish fleet under Rear Admiral Patricio Montojo was destroyed\n\n6. AGUINALDO RETURNS\n\n7. AGUINALDO RETURNS Emilio Famy Aguinaldo returned to Manila with thirteen of his staff on May 19 aboard the American revenue cutter McCulloch, Aguinaldo reassumed command of Filipino rebel forces. When General Emilio Famy Aguinaldo returned to the country from his exile in Hong Kong in May 1898, the truce signed between Filipino revolutionists and Spaniards at Biak-na-Bato in December 1897 had been broken in many parts of the country. Five days after his arrival, on May 24, upon the advise of Ambrosio Rianzares, Aguinaldo temporarily established a dictatorial government, but plans were afoot to proclaim the independence of the country.\n\n8. AGUINALDO AND COMMODORE DEWEY EMILIO AGUINALDO: \"The Admiral added that the United States had come to the Philippines to protect the natives and free them from the yoke of Spain. He said, moreover, that America is exceedingly well off as regards territory, revenue, and resources and therefore needs no colonies, assuring me finally that there was no occasion for me to entertain any doubts whatever about the recognition of the Independence of the Philippines by the United States.“ Aguinaldo, in his book, \"A Second Look At America,\" admitted he naively believed that Dewey \"acted in good faith\" on behalf of the Filipinos.\n\n9. AGUINALDO AND COMMODORE DEWEY In late May, Dewey was ordered by the U.S. Department of the Navy to distance himself from Aguinaldo lest he make untoward commitments to the Philippine forces. Dewey referred to the Filipinos as \"the Indians\" and promised Washington, D.C. that he would \"enter the city (Manila) and keep the Indians out.“\n\n10. THE DICTATORIAL GOVERNMENT Filipino rebels routed the Spaniards in Alapan, Cavite. By early June, with no arms supplied by Dewey, Aguinaldo's forces had overwhelmed Spanish garrisons in Cavite and around Manila, surrounded the capital with 14 miles of trenches, captured the Manila waterworks and shut off access or escape by the Pasig River. Links were established with other movements throughout the country. With the exception of Muslim areas on Mindanao and nearby islands, the Filipinos had taken effective control of the rest of the Philippines. Aguinaldo's 12,000 troops kept the Spanish soldiers bottled up inside Manila until American troop reinforcements could arrive.\n\n11. DECLARATION OF INDEPENDENCE On June 12, 1898, Aguinaldo proclaimed Philippine independence from the window of his house in Kawit, Cavite, and waved the Philippine Flag officially for the first time to the martial strains of the new national anthem.\n\n12. THE PHILIPPINE NATIONAL FLAG The event saw the unfurling of the National Flag of the Philippines, made in Hong Kong by Marcela Agoncillo, Lorenza Agoncillo, and Delfina Herboza. The original design of the flag adopted a mythical sun with a face, a symbol common to several former Spanish colonies. The flag of Cuba influenced the design of the flag of the Philippines as Cuba's revolution against Spain inspired, to some degree, the Philippine Revolution.\n\n14. THE PHILIPPINE NATIONAL FLAG 8 PROVINCES THAT FIRST STARTED 1896 PHILIPPINE REVOLUTION: Manila Cavite Bulacan Pampanga Nueva Ecija Tarlac Laguna Batangas PROPOSALS EMMANUEL OSORIO PRES.
