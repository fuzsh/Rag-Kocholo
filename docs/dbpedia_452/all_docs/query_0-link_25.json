For sample lessons from the latest edition, please click here.\n\nStudent Book\n\nPurpose of Lesson\n\nThis lesson will help you understand why the Founders thought a republican form of government was best. You will also learn about civic virtue and the common welfare.\n\nThe Founders Studied History\n\nThe Founders studied the history of governments. They were very interested in what they read about the government of the Roman Republic. It was located in what is now the country of Italy. The Roman Republic existed more than 2,000 years before our nation began.\n\nThe Founders liked what they read about the Roman Republic. They learned some important ideas from their study of the government of ancient Rome. They used some of these ideas when they created our government.\n\nWhat is a Republican Government?\n\nThe government of Rome was called a republican government. The Founders read that republican government was one in which:\n\nThe power of government is held by the people.\n\nThe people give power to leaders they elect to represent them and serve their interests.\n\nThe representatives are responsible for helping all the people in the country, not just a few people.\n\nVocabulary Terms\n\nRepresentatives: people elected to act for others\n\ninterests: those things which are to a person's benefit\n\nWhat are the Advantages of Republican Government?\n\nThe Founders thought a republican government was the best kind of government they could choose for themselves. They believed that the advantages of republican government were:\n\nFairness. They believed that laws made by the representatives they elected would be fair. If their representatives did not make fair laws, they could elect others who would.\n\nCommon welfare. The laws would help everyone instead of one person or a few favored people.\n\nFreedom and prosperity. People would have greater freedom and be able to live well.\n\nWhat is the Common Welfare?\n\nWhen a government tries to help everyone in a country, we say it is serving the common welfare. The common welfare is what is good for everyone in the country, not just a few people.\n\nProblem Solving\n\nYour Interests and the Common Welfare\n\nHow do you decide what the common welfare is? When should you give up your own interests to do something that is good for everyone? Each person has to answer this question for himself or herself. The following exercise will help you do this.\n\nWork in groups of about three to five students. Each group should discuss the following questions. Be prepared to explain your group's answers to the class.\n\nDescribe a situation in which you think you should try to help others instead of just doing what you want for yourself.\n\nExplain a situation in which you think you should do something for yourself instead of trying to help others.\n\nSometimes people disagree about what is the best thing for everyone. Describe a situation where this might happen. How do you think such disagreements should be settled?\n\nDescribe some things your government does to help everyone in the country. What other things could your government do? Why?\n\nWhat is Civic Virtue?\n\nWhen you work to help others and promote the common welfare, you are showing civic virtue. The Founders thought civic virtue was important for a republican government. People with civic virtue are interested in having the government help all the people.\n\nThe Founders thought it was necessary to teach children the importance of helping others. Young people learned about civic virtue in their homes, schools, and churches. Adults also heard about civic virtue from their religious and political leaders.\n\nThe Founders thought a republican government would work in our country. They believed most of the people had civic virtue. They thought the people would select leaders who would work for the common welfare.\n\nReviewing and Using the Lesson"
