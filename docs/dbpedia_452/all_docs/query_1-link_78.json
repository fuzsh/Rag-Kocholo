        "text": "Malolos stood witness to the catapult of the Filipino nation onto the world’s consciousness carving the birth of the first republic in Asia in 1899.\n\nThough short-lived, the First Philippine, nonetheless catapulted the Filipino nation onto the world’s consciousness carving not only a place among the family of nations but also a distinct niche as the first republic in Asia. While much of the world was oblivious to its birthing, the First Republic proved that Filipinos were capable of self-rule and deserved their longed-for freedom after more than 300 years of colonial bondage- a bondage shaken time and again by sporadic revolts, whose disparateness precluded ultimate victory.\n\nAfter the failure of the reformist movement led by Rizal and Del Pilar, Andres the 1896-98 Philippine Revolution, culminated with the inauguration of the Republic on January 23, 1899 at Barasoain Church in Malolos, Bulacan. Though besieged and eventually thwarted by the United States army, the Republic had earned the loyalty of the Filipino people and deserved the recognition of foreign nations.\n\nThe name of Malolos was presumably derived from the Tagalog word “Paluslos”, meaning ” downwards”. The name resulted from a misunderstanding among the first Spanish missionaries who reached the place. Searching for inhabited places along the Calumpit River, these priests came upon some natives of a riverside barrio (now Kanalate). They asked for the name of the place. The natives, not knowing the Spanish tongue, answered that the flow of the river in that part was downstream -“paluslos”-, which the Spaniards pronounced “Malolos”. Corruption of the word through the years led to present “Malolos”.</p"
