        "text": "Unraveling the Rich History of Philippine Independence\n\nThe Katipunan, also known as Kataastaasan Kagalanggalang na Katipunan ng mga Anak ng Bayan (KKK), holds a prominent place in Philippine history. This revolutionary society played a crucial role in the fight for independence against Spanish colonial rule. Emerging in the late 19th century, it was founded by Filipino patriots who sought to liberate the country from Spanish oppression. It was established on July 7, 1892, by Andres Bonifacio, Teodoro Plata, Ladislao Diwa, along with a group of like-minded individuals who aimed to unite Filipinos and inspire resistance against the Spanish regime.\n\nHowever, to fully understand what brought about for the need of the Katipunan, we have to go further back in time; Starting with the arrival of Ferdinand Magellan in 1521, the Philippines was under Spanish control for over three hundred years. The Spanish colonial government implement a system of governance, favoring Spanish elite, thereby marginalizing the local population. This created a political landscape and a population that sought change. The Katipunan holds a significant place in history, as it played a pivotal role for the Philippines fight for independence.\n\nSpanish abuse, which included forced labor (polo y servicio, high taxation and discrimination caused widespread grievances among the local population, furthered the need for change. This paved the way for revolutionary sentiments to take root.\n\nThe 19th century witnessed the rise of Filipino nationalism and the spread of Enlightenment ideas. Filipino intellectuals, known as ilustrados, became exposed to liberal ideals and concepts of democracy through education in Europe and exposure to foreign literature. The Ilustrados were predominantly from the Filipino middle and upper class and had access to education, which was limited to a privileged few during the Spanish colonial period. They received formal education in prestigious universities, both in the Philippines and abroad, particularly in Spain. This exposure to western education, liberalism and nationalistic ideals shaped their thinking and fueled their desire for social, political, and economic reforms.\n\nTheir newfound knowledge and experiences found their way back to the Philippines as they began advocating for political reforms, social equality, and greater representation for Filipinos. The Ilustrados became advocates for reform, aiming to address the social, economic, and political injustices perpetuated by Spanish colonial rule. They wrote articles, essays, and books discussing the issues of the time, including the oppressive treatment of Filipinos, the abuses of the Spanish colonial government, and the need for equal rights and representation. Through their writings and intellectual discourse, they sought to awaken the consciousness of their fellow Filipinos and inspire a sense of national identity.\n\nThe Ilustrados Philisophy\n\nThe Ilustrados were instrumental in spreading nationalistic ideas and promoting a sense of Filipino identity. They believed in the concept of the “Filipino nation” and championed the idea that the Philippines should have self-governance and sovereignty. They used their writings, publications, and public speeches to raise awareness about the plight of the Filipino people and to foster a sense of unity among Filipinos across different regions and social classes.\n\nHowever, there was a stark divide, both socially and economically between the Spanish ruling class and the majority of the Filipino population. The Spanish elite monopolized land ownership, wealth, and political power and did not wish this to change. In stark contrast, the majority of Filipinos lived in poverty, facing limited opportunities for social or economic change. This large disparity between these two groups helped further fuel the desire for change and the fight for equal rights.\n\nThe Propaganda Movement Starts\n\nThe Propaganda Movement, which the Ilustrados were active in, advocated for reforms and raising awareness of the Filipino cause in Spain. Notable Ilustrados such as Jose Rizal, Marcelo H. del Pilar, and Graciano Lopez Jaena were key figures in this movement which saw the most activity between 1880 through 1895, in the years leading up to the Philippine Revolution. Using newspapers, pamphlets, and other means of communication, they sought to expose the injustices of Spanish colonial rule and to rally support for political changes and independence.\n\nThe overall aim of the Propaganda Movement was to make the Philippines an official Province of Spain through peaceful means which was in shark contrast to the Katipunans, who sought to separate from Spain altogether.\n\nThe emergence of a nascent middle class, composed of educated Filipinos from various social classes, played a crucial role in driving the nationalistic movement. With access to education, exposure to revolutionary ideas from Europe and neighboring countries, they became instrumental in organizing and mobilizing the masses towards the cause of independence.\n\nEnlightenment ideals, such as liberty, equality, and fraternity, heavily influenced the socio-political landscape in the country. Filipinos began questioning the legitimacy of Spanish rule, demanding representation, and asserting their rights as individuals and as a nation. These ideals served as the intellectual foundation for the movement towards independence.\n\nTogether, Ilustrados and the Propaganda Movement, both indirectly influenced the Katipunan; through Filipino nationalism and reformist ideas, which ultimately rippled through the population. It raised awareness about injustices being faced by Filipinos, and the need for both political and social change. The Ilustrados’ call for reforms and the exposure of Spanish abuses helped create the perfect environment for the emergence of the Katipunan. Though the Ilustrados shared many ideas with the Katipunan, both groups were distinctly differently with their approach.\n\nThe Propaganda Movement gave rise to La Liga Filipina (The Philippine League), which was founded by José Rizal, a prominent Ilustrado. La Liga Filipina was established as a secret society, looking to get Filipinos directly involved with reform, as well as providing scholarships, legal aid and lending capital.\n\nMany have debated about Rizal’s push for peaceful reform but, few have discussed his long term outlook for the Philippines. For this, we would have to look at European history to understand the world stage at the time and what many Ilustrados may have learned or even seen first-hand, including Rizal.\n\nAt the time, Spain managed their overseas empire as a feudal system. Nobles and select individuals were given titles and presided over estates, managing the land’s resources and people while giving a percentage of the profits to Spain. In the early colonial period, this system was extremely beneficial to Spain, who looked to continued expansion, which would hopefully only add more distinction and gold to Spain. At this time, Spain held a lot of land, including the Netherlands, and even a good portion of Italy. So long as the Nobles continued to send money to Spain, Spain was able to pay its debts, manage their massive armada and continue to look towards expansion.\n\nIn theory, this sounds plausible, and it did at first. However, as a feudal system, many of the estates were passed on to heirs to manage the land, people and resources. Many times, these individuals were not qualified nor educated on systems of management, and thus it would only be a matter of time that many of the estates were no longer sending money back to Spain.\n\nThe Beginning of War\n\nEighty Years War\n\nThe Dutch revolt, which was known as the Eighty Years War, starting in the mid 1500’s, ending in the mid 1600’s had a lasting effect for Spain. This included several naval battles around the Philippines known as Battles of La Naval de Manila or Battle of Manila Bay, which the Dutch hoped to minimize Spanish influence and trade in the area, replacing it with their own. Soon after the end of the Eighty Years War, which ended in 1646, Charles II inherited the throne in 1665. By this time, Spain saw constant conflict in the past century, which would continue.\n\nThe Nine Years War which saw Spain’s standing armies grow to 100,000 in Europe, before the turn of the century in 1697 coincided with the Great Famine which further exhausted not only Spain, buy many countries in Europe. When Charles II passed away childless in 1700, many nations expected conflict to continue once again.\n\nWar of the Spanish Succession\n\nWar of the Spanish Succession started in 1701 as two different heirs vied for the Spanish Empire – Philip of Anjou and Charles of Austria. The Peace of Utrecht, which was a series of peace treaties between 1713-15 saw the end of the war and confirmed Philip as King of Spain, and the beginning of the House of Bourbon which still rules to this day. Spain was able to retain its independence and holding most of its vast empire, except for Spanish Netherlands and much of Italy, Gibraltar and Menorca.\n\nUnder Bourbon reforms, power was centralized and illicit trade was minimized and Spain was slowly rebuilding. This did not last however as Spain was once again engulfed in war. The Napoleonic Wars in 1808 further destabilized Spain, civil wars and eventually a liberal democracy with a constitution. This however overlapped uprisings, the independence of Mexico in 1821, along with additional conflicts in throughout the Spanish Americas.\n\nThe Ten Years War (1868-78) beginning in Cuba, would eventually lead to Cuba’s war of Independence in 1895, and the U.S. declaring war with Spain in 1898.\n\nBy now, Ilustrados studying in Spain or visiting other parts of Europe would have learned about ongoing conflict in the Spanish Americas. Britain was becoming a world power with naval superiority and a strong trading system established throughout Southeast Asia. The U.S. was a young country that was expanding in North America.\n\nThough, Spain was no longer a super power, they still were contenders, as was shown when they sent 200,000 soldiers to Cuba during their war for Independence. This was the largest Atlantic crossing for an army until WWII. Ilustrados, like Rizal, contended the long-term benefit for the country and whether the Philippines would be better off as an independent nation, as a province with rights, freedoms and equality for Filipinos or conflict/colonization from another country altogether… He actually hoped that the Philippines, being an archipelagic country, with its various regions, diverse languages, customs and traditions would become a Federal Republic, as he said in his essay – Filipinas dentro de cien años.\n\nMexico after winning their independence just several decades earlier, was facing a crisis. Their labor force was significantly depleted due to the war. It is estimated that around one-sixth of the population, primarily men responsible for physical labor like farming and mining, had perished in war. This severe loss of manpower led to a decline in food production. Furthermore, the presence of numerous bodies on fields and overcrowding in the trenches resulted in the spread of infectious diseases throughout many areas.\n\nAlthough Mexico had gained independence from Spain, it was still under the influence of the Church and the wealthy classes. Furthermore, the new government inherited an external debt incurred to finance soldiers’ salaries, weapons, and other war-related expenses.\n\nKatipunan Becomes Known\n\nThese would all be similar issues that an independent Philippines would face as well. Potential conflict with Britain, the Dutch who were looking to expand their mercantile trade routes would also become a potential factor again. Could the Philippines remain independent or would they face potential colonization again under British or Dutch. However, much of that did not matter, in 1896 when Spain learned about the Katipunan, a secret society working toward independence from Spain.\n\nThe writings and works of Ilustrados like Jose Rizal, Marcelo H. del Pilar, and Graciano Lopez Jaena were a source of inspiration for the members of the Katipunan. These intellectual leaders provided a foundation of nationalistic thought, advocating for Filipino identity, unity, and self-determination. The Katipunan drew upon these ideas to shape their own revolutionary ideology, seeking to actualize the aspirations expressed by the Ilustrados.\n\nHowever, some Ilustrados, such as Antonio Luna and Emilio Jacinto, had direct involvement with the Katipunan. These Ilustrados became influential figures within the revolutionary movement, providing leadership, guidance, and strategic expertise. Their education and intellectual background were valuable assets to the Katipunan, bringing a level of sophistication and organizational acumen to their efforts. However, the society also organized military training, gathering weapons, and spreading nationalist ideals through their publication, the “Kalayaan” newspaper which saw print in March 1896. Much of the Katipunan Society were influenced by masonic rites, as many founders were freemasons.\n\nThe discontent and nationalistic fervor cultivated by the Ilustrados contributed to the radicalization of Filipinos, particularly, marginalized groups of society, who sought more drastic measures to achieve their goals. The revolutionary spirit, need for national identity and unity spoken about by the Ilustrados served as a catalyst for the formation and mobilization of the Katipunan. Transcending regional, geographic and societal divisions, Filipinos came together as the Katipunan, with the independence of the Philippines as their ultimate goal.\n\nAdvocating for freedom, equality and social justice, society members took part in secret meetings, rituals, and ceremonies. To continue to maintain secrecy, the Katipunan developed a complex system of codes and symbols. They had three degrees of membership: Katipon, Kawal, and Bayani. Each member took an oath of loyalty and committed to the cause of the organization. The Katipunan’s emblem, the triangle, represented their threefold ideals of liberty, equality, and fraternity.\n\nRecently discovered documents suggest that Katipunan were organizing as early as January 1892 but only became active July 7th, of that year, when Rizal was to be banished. Bonifacio, who was a member of La Liga Filipina, along with Plata, Diwa, Diaz, Arellano, and Dizon, founded the Katipunan in a house on Azcarraga St. in San Nicolas, Manila. They named Rizal as honorary president, without his knowledge, even though they were concerned with his stance on peaceful reformation. Bonifacio offered to rescue Rizal in exchange for support of the organization.\n\nThe Philippine Revolution\n\nThe Katipunan had four aims, namely:\n\nto develop a strong alliance with each and every Katipunero\n\nto unite Filipinos into one solid nation;\n\nto win Philippine independence by means of an armed conflict (or revolution);\n\nto establish a republic after independence.\n\nIn 1896, after a failed attempt to purchase arms from a Japanese warship, the Katipunan’s existence was exposed to Spanish authorities, triggering the Philippine Revolution. The revolutionaries took up arms, launching a series of uprisings across the country. Things however, came to a head on August 23rd (or 24th – the exact date is not known and was debated; the Philippine government declared August 23 to be the date of the event in Quezon City) as the second meeting of the second meeting of the Katipuneros where they decided to start an armed uprising against Spain. This has become to be known as the Cry of Pugad Lawin, the beginning of the Philippines Revolution, where Bonifacio and his men tore their “cedula” or tax certificate in defiance, symbolizing the start of the armed struggle for independence.\n\nThe “cedula” was a personal identification document or a certificate of residence that was used during the Spanish colonial period as a means of documenting and collecting taxes from the Filipino population. Implemented in the late 19th century, every Filipino was required to obtain a cedula and carry it at all times as proof of identity and residency. The symbolic act of tearing it up was a pledge to the revolution. As Bonifacio declared, “If it is true that you are ready to revolt… I want to see you destroy your cedulas. It will be a sign that all of us have declared our severance from the Spaniards.” (Zaide, Gregorio (1990). “Cry of balintawak”. Documentary Sources of Philippine History)\n\nBattle of Kakarong de Sili was fought on January 1, 1897 and was an important milestone for the Katipunans. After the unsuccessful Battle of San Juan del Monte, Katipuneros in Bulacan established the Kakarong Republic – the Cry of Balintawak, shortly after the Cry of Pugad Lawin. This was the first organized revolutionary government in the country.\n\nAlthough the initial Philippine Revolution led by the Katipunan did not immediately achieve independence, it spurred nationalism among Filipinos. The Katipunan’s principles and bravery paved the way for future resistances, which ultimately led to the successful revolution against Spanish rule.\n\nEven today, the Katipunan have become an enduring symbol of Filipino nationalism and patriotism. The bravery and sacrifice of its members in the pursuit of independence have been celebrated and revered by generations of Filipinos. The ideals of freedom, justice, and self-governance continue to inspire and resonate with the Filipinos today, while serving as a reminder of their collective struggle and aspirations.\n\nIronically, one significant contribution by the Katipunan that many may not realize, is their contribution to Philippine history. The collected writings, memoirs, and accounts of the group’s members have provided invaluable insights into the society’s activities, the broader revolutionary movement, and give us a look at the country’s socio-political climate of the time. These records have aided historians in piecing together the narrative of the Philippine Revolution and understanding the significance of the Katipunan.\n\nToday, Filipinos continue to reference Katipunan, as it serves as a source of inspiration and guideline for creating positive change within the Philippines. Much of is considered to be the “Filipino Spirit” is traced back to the Katipunans, without whom, the country of the Philippines would not exist. Their role in Philippine history is significant and as such, many pay respects to them, especially on Independence Day.\n\nMonument Dedicated to the Katipunan\n\nThe Bonifacio Monument (also known as the Andrés Bonifacio Monument or Monumento), is a memorial structure located in Caloocan, Philippines was created by renowned artist Guillermo Tolentino as a tribute to Andrés Bonifacio.\n\nStanding at a height of 13.7 meters (45 feet), the monument features symbolic imagery and elements related to the “Cry of Balintawak.” Consisting of five parts that represent different aspects of society, namely the “Kataastaasan, Kagalanggalang na Katipunan ng mga Anak ng Bayan” (Highest and Most Venerable Association of the Sons of the Nation), there is a triumphant figure with wings, symbolizing victory at the very top.\n\nBeneath the vertical pylon, there are 20 bronze figures molded onto an octagonal-shaped base, with an additional angel of peace at the pinnacle. The octagon represents the eight provinces that fought against Spanish rule and also corresponds to the eight rays depicted on the Katipunan flag. The base is raised on three steps, symbolizing the three centuries of Spanish dominance. These figures represent the Filipino people who endured inequality, suffering, and suppression during the colonial era, leading to an armed revolution in 1896 that eventually brought an end to Spanish rule.\n\nThe Bonifacio Shrine, also referred to as the Kartilya ng Katipunan or Heroes Park, is a public park and plaza located in Ermita, Manila, Philippines. Through the ongoing efforts of the city to clean up and eliminate illegal vendors, the bronze monument honoring Emilio Jacinto, which had been hidden from view for many years, has now become visible once again.\n\nThe Rizal Monument, originally known as Motto Stella (Latin for “guiding star”), is a memorial located in Rizal Park, Manila, Philippines. The monument features a standing bronze sculpture of Rizal, holding his renowned novels “El Filibusterismo” and “Noli Me Tangere,” placed on an obelisk situated atop a stone base. Rizal’s remains are interred within the base. A plaque on the front of the pedestal bears the inscription: “This monument is dedicated by the people of the Philippine Islands to the memory of José Rizal, a patriot and martyr who was executed on Bagumbayan Field on December 30, 1896.”\n\nAs we come upon Independence Day, take time to remember the details of history in all of its depth. Though many easily remember Bonifacio and the Katipunan, many have failed to realize the vital contributions and decades of events that have led up to them. Would the Katipunan have existed without Bonifacio? Would Bonifacio have been revolutionary without La Liga? Would La Liga have come to be without the Propaganda Movement? Would the movement have gained support if it wasn’t for Rizal or the other Ilustrados.\n\nIt can be easy to relegate history to a singular event, but it is tied to people, events and circumstances worldwide. It is important for people to explore history, our history at length, and for our academics and historians to help spread this knowledge. So on this Independence Day, take a moment to understand the grand events that have cultivated into leading the Philippines to become it’s own country, it’s own people with it’s own destiny."
