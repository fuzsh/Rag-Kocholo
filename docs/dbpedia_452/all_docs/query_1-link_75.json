This indicates an increase of 7.6 percent from 1.83 million OFWs in the same period of 2021. Of the total OFWs, the number of Overseas Contract Workers (OCWs) or those with existing work contracts was posted at 1.94 million. On the other hand, other OFWs who worked abroad without working visa or work permits such as tourist, visitor, student, medical, and other types of non-immigrant visas but were employed and working full time in other countries was estimated at 26 thousand.

The same trend was observed in 2021 where 1.10 million (60.2%) OFWs were women, while 726 thousand (39.8%) were men.

Service and sales workers were the second largest group of OFWs with 15.5 percent, while plant machine operators and assemblers were the third largest group accounting for 12.4 percent.

This was followed by Central Luzon or Region III (13.3%), Western Visayas or Region VI (11.1%), National Capital Region (10.9%), and Ilocos Region or Region I (9.1%). (Table 2 and Figure 4)\n\nIn 2022, Luzon accounted for majority (62.7%) of the total OFWs, followed by Visayas at 20.7 percent and Mindanao at 16.6 percent. (Table 3)\n\nSaudi Arabia is the leading destination of OFWs\n\nIn 2022, the top five destinations of OFWs were the following: Asia (80.8%), Europe (9.0%), North and South America (6.3%), Australia (2.9%), and Africa (1.0%). Of the total 1.96 million OFWs in 2022, about 23.0 percent worked in Saudi Arabia, followed by United Arab Emirates at 13.7 percent. Other countries in Asia with large number of OFWs include Kuwait (7.7%), Hong Kong (6.1%), Qatar (5.8%), and Singapore (5.0%). (Table 5 and Figure 5)\n\nTotal Remittance reached 197 billion pesos in 2022\n\nAmong the 1.96 million OFWs, 41.7 percent sent remittance between 40 thousand pesos to less than 100 thousand pesos, while 20.7 percent remitted at least 100 thousand pesos from April to September 2022. (Table 6)\n\nThe total remittance of the OFWs during the period April to September 2022 reached 197.47 billion pesos. This includes cash sent (145.40 billion pesos), cash brought home (43.90 billion pesos), and in kind (8.17 billion pesos). (Table 7 and Figure 6)\n\nOf the 145.40 billion pesos cash remittance of the OFWs sent to the country, 103.45 billion were from Asian countries. (Table 8)\n\nThe average remittance sent by every OFW from April to September 2022 was placed at 111 thousand pesos, higher than the 91 thousand pesos average remittance in the same period of 2021. (Tables 1 and 7)\n\nBanks are most preferred mode in sending cash remittances\n\nIn terms of the preferred mode of remittance in 2022, about 83.19 billion pesos or 57.2 percent of the total cash remittances were sent by the OFWs through banks. Aside from banks, cash remittances were made through money transfer services amounting to 59.85 billion pesos or 41.2 percent. Collective share of around 1.6 percent of the cash remittances sent by the Filipinos working in other countries were through agency/local office of the OFW, friends/co-worker, door to door, and others.
