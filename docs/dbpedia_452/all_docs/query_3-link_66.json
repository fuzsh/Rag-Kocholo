        "text": "A SAFE and convertible note had a baby and Wilson Sonsini Goodrich & Rosati was the midwife- out popped the D-SAFE! üë∂üèΩüéâ A new #climatetech funding instrument was announced by Elemental Excelerator last week. One of the company‚Äôs main goals is to support smaller, up and coming companies during the awkward ‚ÄúScale Gap‚Äù phase between #VC funding and natural growth. It‚Äôs called the #DSAFE (Development Simple Agreement for Future Equity) and it aims to aid the process by giving companies a small amount of cash to overcome initial risks and expenses during the developmental stages of a product launch or company. How does it work? D-SAFE has a redemption clause meaning companies can choose to have their payments offered as a loan or convert to equity at the investor‚Äôs discretion. Funders and companies will have clear communication and expectations about where the money is going and how it will be applied to either the company or the projects at hand. Financiers and companies will work together with more #transparency, and that‚Äôs a great boon for #startups and VC alike. As of this month, Elemental has already invested using D-SAFE in eight different companies, including Dimensional Energy and Origen ‚Äî both companies investing in innovative and out-of-the-box solutions to environmental issues! Seems like a win-win on the surface. What do you all think about the D-SAFE? Alfredo Coppola Momoka Ueda Tim Wagner Stephen D. Torres Olya Irzak Natsuho Toyama Noriya Tarutani Shin Ogawa\n\n15\n\n6 Comments\n\nFriends, Q2 was a quarter of progress and learning for us at HawkTower, where we invest in early-stage startups applying breakthrough computing technologies to maximize California's natural resource markets. Our focus is on technology-enabled interventions (e.g., AI-enabled geospatial radars for lithium-ion batteries in the waste stream) for critical, market-level imperatives (e.g., disaster prevention) that can drive rapid commercial adoption (e.g., placed on every recycling truck in the world). Our current investment priorities are: - Agricultural productivity and efficiency - Biomanufacturing - Labor and mobility automation - Waste stream optimization and decarbonization - Disaster prevention and management Here‚Äôs a snapshot of what we‚Äôve been up to: Milestones and Investments: - In late April, we officially launched our fund, filing with the SEC. Yay. - By June, we completed our first fund close ahead of schedule, with backing from family offices, foundations, high-net-worth individuals, and organizations aligned with California's future. - Our portfolio now includes three early-stage investments (Farm-ng, Agriful Software, and Nexstera Tech). Strategic Partnerships: - We believe that startups operating closer to their customers and resources, especially in agriculture and biomanufacturing, have a strategic advantage. For instance, the Salinas Valley, a major agricultural hub, is less than an hour from Silicon Valley and serves as a center of thought leadership in the convergence of agriculture and AI (from Western Growers, Taylor Farms, and others). - Similarly, the North San Joaquin Valley is emerging as a biotech and agtech innovation hub, and we are proud to support BEAM Circular, a startup hub for the circular bioeconomy. Key Relationships: - Karen Warner, CEO of BEAM Circular, joined HawkTower as a strategic advisor. - Jackie Cruz, Ed. D. Cruz, Hartnell College‚Äôs VP of Advancement, advises on Salinas Valley and workforce development. - Ben Palone from Western Growers, with his technical background in agriculture, became a trusted advisor. - Matthew Hoffman from Driscoll's Global R&D team provides insights on global agriculture, product positioning, and investment strategy. - We collaborated with Monterey Bay DART for workforce development and automation in agtech. - Dominic Milano and the Milano Technical Group from Merced collaborated on key initiatives and advised us on investments. - HawkTower is participating in Santa Cruz Works's accelerator cohort as a mentor and advisor. Thank you Doug Erickson. - We published an overview of entrepreneurship across the UC system with input from across the University of California system. Moving into the fall, we remain deeply committed to supporting founders shaping California's future natural resource markets. Stay tuned and be in touch! : ) Db\n\n94\n\n5 Comments\n\nWhat do you do when a radical new technology puts your main product right in the crosshairs of disruption? Listen to David Okuniev ‚Äî co-founder of Typeform | Ask awesomely ‚Äî discuss the challenges of innovation within existing structures. David shared a game-changing insight: Radical innovation is really, really difficult to do inside your own product. He emphasized the need to break free from the constraints of familiarity and embrace change from outside the box. Henrik Werdelin and I have both seen our fair share of this in our respective careers. What struck us most was how David leveraged structure to overcome the innovator‚Äôs dilemma. By creating a culture of experimentation and providing space for bold ideas, he propelled Typeform beyond incremental improvements. What other hacks have you seen or employed to help your organization overcome the innovator‚Äôs dilemma?

I‚Äôve been thinking about how to apply the proper balance of patience and urgency to the climate fight. First, what does Wooden‚Äôs advice mean? Prolific basketball scorers will often talk about the need to ‚Äúlet the game come to you.‚Äù In other words be aggressive, move with purpose, probe for openings‚Ä¶ but not to the point where you are hurrying into the teeth of the defense and in so doing making careless mistakes or missing the right play. The notion of patience also applies over time. Joel Embiid of the Philadelphia 76ers famously talked a few seasons ago (in a very impatient sports town) about trusting ‚ÄúThe Process‚Äù in turning the league‚Äôs worst team into one of its enduring best. Back to climate. While hundreds of functional technologies/approaches are being deployed in thousands of ways across all industries to draw down emissions, it will take time we don‚Äôt really have ‚Äî maybe a generation ‚Äî to scale up these new methods enough to keep us under the warming levels above which really bad things happen. It can be depressing, and I‚Äôm certainly not alone in wanting to push harder. But it occurs to me that some of that urgency could qualify as hurrying in Coach Wooden‚Äôs sense. This (possibly contrarian?) perspective comes in part from an executive coach who once reflected that I sometimes struck him as having ‚Äúboth the gas and brake pushed down all the way.‚Äù He‚Äîand my team it turned out‚Äîexperienced a grinding between my inner drive to quickly usher everything from decisions to workstreams through to conclusion and a desire to gather more information and make the perfect set of moves. Both ‚Äúpedals‚Äù represented an exertion of control; and the solution to this inner tension was actually to practice patience by easing up with *both* feet. Point being this: amidst our ever-increasing incentives to ramp up velocity with decreasing margins for error, I wonder if being a bit more methodical each day could significantly improve the end result. In a realm as complex and fraught as climate, with so many entrenched defenses, could daily 1% improvements to our patience compound our effectiveness over time? Taking the extra breath to be more present in a conversation and learn more about another perspective. Sitting with the discomfort of ambiguity while waiting on more information. Trusting in the flow of things, the skills of colleagues, the angles that will appear and allow us to make outsized impact with more leverage than if we hadn‚Äôt allowed the game come to us. Think about it this week. As a hoops fans or climate warrior, a connector or caretaker ‚Äî where and how could a little more patience help improve your part of the game? #ClimateChange #Sustainability #EarthDay #Improvement https://lnkd.in/gmyV3DYt\n\n8\n\n1 Comment\n\nRethinkX's recent publication on The Rise of Human Robots and The Future of Work is quite interesting. Tony Seba and his team including Adam Dorr and Bradd Libby, do an excellent job dissecting the emerging humanoid robot technology market. Here's a brief summary, with a more in-depth summary from Cern Basher, CFA, an expert on the future financial impacts of humanoid robots, linked in the comments below: The rise of humanoid robots is poised to disrupt human labor across industries, much like how automobiles disrupted horses. This convergence of technologies creating a \"labor engine\" will enable robots to eventually perform virtually any task better and cheaper than humans. Initially, robots will complement human workers by taking on simpler tasks. However, their capabilities will rapidly improve until they can do almost anything humans can by the 2040s. This disruption represents both a massive opportunity and challenge for society. As the marginal cost of robotic labor approaches zero, we can expect sweeping deflationary pressures and quality improvements across the economy. Labor supply will explode, uncoupled from population growth, giving nations with robust robotics industries a strategic advantage. While creating prosperity, this transition will destabilize conventional economics and the social contract around work. Thoughtful policymaking will be critical to avoid catastrophic unemployment or stifling innovation through misguided protectionism. Ultimately, humanoid robotics could lead to superabundance and liberation from labor. But achieving this will require rethinking economics, embracing the disruption responsibly, and prioritizing policies that protect people over obsolete jobs and industries. https://lnkd.in/gjNDVQe4 #humanoids #robotics #futurefrontier\n\n3\n\n1 Comment\n\nAn interesting article below, that demonstrates out how San Diego is punching above its weight. And how Connect's strategy and execution over time, contintues to be central to that success. The article describes the current state of the market in Seattle. (And i love Seattle.) It's a market that we tend to track with relative to venture fundings. They used to kick our butts, we outraised them each of the last three years. This despite the fact they have 3x as many funds there, and 9x the amount of resident capital there. (per pitchbook) Some key takeaways: * They continue to compare themselves to SIlicon Valley. Instead, we leverage our proximity. *They whine there's not enough local investors (see note above - they have more than us). We bring over 200 VCs to SD annually! * They say founders are not connected with one another. We bring CEOs together regularly, in a variety of ways - private dinners and through our Springboard program. * They say they need to elevate their image on a national & international stage. Why we created and continue to build Five.Ten.Thirty (aka Inno Day). * And the last paragraph - they need to concentrate on making their region a great place to live. Our mantra: \"It's about Better, not Bigger.\" (See XEO, TL Fund). THANK YOU FOR ALL OF YOUR SUPPORT. WE ARE ON A MISSION TOGETHER!!! (Comments, whining, suggestions on SD always welcome.) https://lnkd.in/g6Rq_f2Y\n\n109\n\n10 Comments\n\nüåüInnovative VC Firm Overcomes Exits Drought with Secondary Salesüåü ‚õµNavigating a challenging landscape where exits are scarce, Santa Barbara Venture Partners (SBVP) has pioneered a novel approach to sustain its growth and attract investors for its second fund: secondary sales. Instead of waiting for traditional exits like IPOs or acquisitions, SBVP opted to sell shares of its portfolio companies, demonstrating its ability to generate returns for investors and stand out in a competitive market. üé§According to Dan Engel, founder and managing partner of SBVP, these secondary transactions have been a game-changer, sparking investor interest and bolstering the firm's credibility. By leveraging its recent successes, including a lucrative stake in sports-betting company DraftKings Inc.' acquisition of digital lottery app Jackpocket, SBVP seized the opportunity to return profits to its limited partners (LPs) and pave the way for its second fund. üí°Engel highlighted the challenges faced by young VC firms in raising subsequent funds, particularly amid a downturn in exit activity and heightened investor scrutiny. With traditional exit routes becoming increasingly elusive, the pressure is on for firms to demonstrate tangible returns and establish a track record of success. ‚ú®\"For us, secondary sales have been a game-changer. They've helped us return profits to our LPs and attract investors for our second fund,\" said Dan Engel. üí∞For SBVP, the decision to pursue secondary sales was driven by the need to provide liquidity to LPs and validate its investment thesis in the eyes of prospective investors. By strategically offloading portions of its holdings in high-performing portfolio companies like Bark Technologies and Rad AI, SBVP not only generated substantial returns but also bolstered investor confidence in its ability to deliver results. ‚ö†Despite the complexities and potential stigma associated with early share sales, Engel emphasized the importance of prioritizing investor returns and seizing opportunities to unlock value for stakeholders. With a focus on profitability and transparency, SBVP remains committed to its mission of delivering sustainable growth and maximizing returns for its LPs. üîç \"Returning profits to our investors is our top priority. By strategically selling shares, we're proving our commitment to delivering results and driving value for our stakeholders,\" added Engel. As SBVP continues to explore secondary transactions and expand its investor base, the firm stands as a testament to innovation and resilience in the face of market challenges. üöÄ ‚úÖ Looking to raise capital for your #fund and increase the international pool of your LP #investors? ü§ù Need warm #LP introductions? üìù Selling #secondaries to increase liquidity? üßê Looking for co-investments? ‚ñ∂ G+QUANT's link for inquiries and fund decks: https://lnkd.in/gjC_EuTE #VCInnovation #SecondarySalesSuccess #InvestorReturns #ValueCreation\n\n2\n\nExciting news! We just sent out the inaugural newsletter for Future Frontier Capital, our pre-seed venture fund backing frontier tech startups. As I hit \"send,\" I realized how launching FFC parallels the path of the founders we support. Starting FFC has required the same passion, perseverance, and self-belief that drive entrepreneurs. Just like a startup, getting a VC fund off the ground demands relentless hustle‚Äîbuilding the brand, perfecting the pitch, and networking tirelessly. There are constant challenges that test your resolve and endless hours of unglamorous work behind the scenes. And perhaps most daunting - the self-doubt, wondering if you're crazy for attempting something so bold. Pushing through that negative self-talk requires unshakable faith in your mission. Raising this VC fund reminds me of starting our IP strategy and patent analytics firm two decades ago. It‚Äôs a powerful reminder of the perseverance, creativity, and resilience needed to turn an ambitious idea into reality. This experience makes us more empathetic partners, ready to support the founders we back. Our work is just beginning, and this inaugural newsletter underscores our commitment to supporting frontier tech startups every step of the way. #startups #VentureCapital #EmergingManagers #Entrepreneurship #InnovationMindSet\n\n21\n\n2 Comments\n\nIt‚Äôs encore time in our ‚ÄúVision 2035: The Emergent Singularity‚Äù series! In the fast-paced world of early-stage venture investment, anticipating and mitigating risks are paramount for fostering sustainable growth and societal impact. At Machine Ventures, we're not merely preparing for the near future; our foresight extends over the next decade and beyond. The 2024 Global Risk Report from the World Economic Forum delivers a sobering message, indicating a \"negative outlook\" for the next few years, with potential challenges intensifying over the decade. Key concerns highlighted include climate change, ideological divisions, rapid technological progress, and demographic shifts in developed economies, all of which are poised to significantly influence macro-economic and political landscapes, profoundly shaping markets and startup ecosystems alike. Economically, we anticipate a global slowdown, with The World Bank projecting a deceleration in growth for the third consecutive year. Developed economies could experience sluggish activity due to persistent high interest rates, exacerbated by geopolitical tensions and disruptions in global supply chains, such as ongoing chip shortages. This scarcity underscores vulnerabilities that are critical for advancements in AI and machine intelligence, potentially delaying product launches, hindering research and development efforts, and impeding its impact on economic growth. On the political front, evolving regulatory frameworks surrounding AI in the EU and US aim to mitigate risks associated with technological progress, and possibly compounded by geo-political tensions. Furthermore, the rapid pace of AI development will certainly continue to outpace regulatory efforts for the foreseeable future. Despite these multifaceted challenges, we believe our strategic approach remains resilient. Embracing an 'open-stack' philosophy and diversifying our commitments across the US and Europe, as well as across sectors ‚Äì where machine intelligence will have force multiplying impact ‚Äì allows us to adapt flexibly to emerging risks. Our mission is steadfast: to support startups that not only generate economic value but also contribute positively to society. We look forward to building that future with many of you! Patrick & Sri #singularity #machineintelligence #ai\n\n6"
