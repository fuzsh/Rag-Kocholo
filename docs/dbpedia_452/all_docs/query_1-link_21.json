        "text": "The Old Chancery, located at 1617 Massachusetts Avenue, N.W., was acquired on 13 October 1941 from Mrs. Stella Stapleton, wife of Daniel Stapleton, owner of two platinum mines in Ecuador and Colombia. It was at 1617 Massachusetts Avenue where the National Catholic Welfare Conference was first held and many welfare and religious projects were conceived and developed.\n\nAlthough the Philippines acquired the property in 1941, the Office of the Resident Commission did not move in until 1943. For a time during World War II, the building was also the headquarters of the Philippine Commonwealth Government-in-Exile. When the Philippines achieved independence and became a Republic in 1946, the Office of the Resident Commissioner became the Embassy of the Philippines, and the building became the Chancery.\n\nWhen the Main Chancery was inaugurated, the Old Chancery became the Chancery Annex. In 1998, the Government of the Philippines signed an agreement to turn over the Old Chancery to a coalition of Filipino American organizations to serve as a center for community activities. However, the deal did not come to fruition and the Old Chancery underwent several renovations since.\n\nThe Consular Section is located at the first floor and third floor of the building. The former office of the ambassador on the second floor was converted into an event space and renamed as the Quezon Hall, after former resident commissioner and president Manuel L. Quezon. The fourth floor houses the Embassy’s Sentro Rizal, the Philippine Overseas Labor Office—Overseas Workers Welfare Administration, and the Office of the Police Attaché.\n\nArtworks of National Artist Fernando Amorsolo as well as contemporary Filipino artists can be seen in the building. The ground floor boasts an entryway lobby with hanging lamps from Kenneth Cobonpue (“Fandango”) and a wall mural by Mr. Dominic Rubio (“The Great Promenade of Philippine-American Friendship”) leading to the waiting area for consular applicants. On the second floor, Amorsolo’s Portrait of Manuel L. Quezon is the centerpiece of the Quezon Hall, and the multi-purpose room across is surrounded by several paintings from Filipino artists. The Ann Pamintuan’s metal furniture (“Cocoon”) are displayed at the Sentro Rizal on the fourth floor.\n\nThe building bears witness to several milestones throughout its history. In 1945, then-Resident Commissioner Carlos P. Romulo moved the Philippine flag to its peacetime position to officially mark “the coming of peace to the Philippines.” A year later, in July 1946, during the proclamation of Philippine independence, President Truman’s proclamation was read, the American flag was lowered, and the Philippine flag was raised.\n\nIn 1961, on the 19th Anniversary of the Fall of Bataan, the two small streets bordering Scott Circle were named Bataan and Corregidor Streets as a reminder of the close ties between the Philippines and the United States, as well as the shared experience “in defense of democracy and freedom.”\n\nThe Old Chancery also witnessed the danger that diplomats face in their line of work. On 18 November 1974, Philippine Ambassador to the United States Eduardo Z. Romualdez and economic attaché Mario S. Lagdameo were held at gunpoint for 10 hours in the Ambassador’s office. Diosdado M. Lorenzo’s portrait of Andres Bonifacio, which bears a hole from a stray bullet during the incident, is displayed on the second floor of the Chancery Annex to this day. In 1983, a week after the assassination of Senator Benigno S. Aquino, Jr., three men hurled two firebombs in front of the Old Chancery, shattering the main doors.\n\nDue to its significance to our nation’s history, the National Historical Commission of the Philippines declared in 2018 the Old Chancery as a National Historical Landmark, the second structure to be designated as such outside of the Philippines.\n\nThe Chancery Annex underwent a second renovation starting in 2018 with the renovation of the two-level mechanical room at the back of the building. In 2019, power wash cleaning of the building’s exteriors and ground repairs and hardscaping were completed. The public area on the first floor was expanded to give more space for clients, and the second floor men’s room was converted into a pantry that will be used for events. The offices and conference room of the Consular Section are now found on the third floor. The fourth floor was renovated into offices of partner agencies that provide direct services to the public, and the Sentro Rizal. A steel perimeter fence was installed to improve the building’s security.\n\nThe Main Chancery is located at 1600 Massachusetts Avenue, corner Bataan St. N.W., Washington, D.C. 20036. It stands directly behind the standing figure of Daniel Webster, the “Expounder of the US Constitution” along Scott Circle. What is known as “Embassy Row” starts at Scott Circle, where chanceries and residences of Embassies accredited to the United States are located, and ends by the circular grounds of the US Naval Observatory on Massachusetts Avenue.\n\nThe classic lines of the Beaux-Arts building allow it to blend with the older, imposing buildings along Massachusetts Avenue. It stands alone on the block at the intersection of 17th Street and Massachusetts Avenue, facing the Johns Hopkins University Building, with the Embassy of Peru across the street at the right side and Beacon Hotel at the back, along N Street.\n\nPlans for a new four-story and basement annex had come up as early as 1947, but it was only in 1969 that the land on 1600 Massachusetts Ave NW was acquired by the government. In November 1993, President Fidel V. Ramos inaugurated the building during his first Official Visit to Washington, D.C.\n\nThe reception area and the Defense and Armed Forces Affairs Office are located on the ground floor. A wood-paneled, marble-floored corridor leads to the Carlos P. Romulo Hall, where the Embassy hosts its events. The sweeping double staircase at the entrance leads to the offices of the Ambassador, the Deputy Chief of Mission, and the Administrative Section. The functional sections of the Embassy (Political and Legislative, Economic, and Public and Cultural Diplomacy), as well as the Embassy Library can be found on the third floor. The offices of Partner Agency Representatives (Agriculture, Foreign Liaison, and Commercial), conference rooms, and records room are all on the fourth floor.\n\nFor the first time since its inauguration, the Main Chancery underwent major repairs and renovation works in 2019. Various improvements were made to the exterior of the building, such as power wash cleaning, ground repairs and hardscaping. Inside, the carpets and flooring were replaced, the walls repainted, and LED lights installed. The Embassy also beefed up its security by upgrading its security cameras into high-definition CCTV and adding more security cameras.\n\nThe official Residence of the Philippine Ambassador to the United States is located at 2253 R Street, N.W. Washington, D.C. Around the circle is a cluster of marble and sandstone mansions, once homes to the Washington elite. Now, many of these buildings sit on pieces of foreign soil and serve as chanceries of various embassies and residences of foreign ambassadors.\n\nThe three-storey sandstone mansion was built in 1904 for General and Mrs. Charles L. Fitzhugh. Then-Philippine Resident Commissioner to the U.S. Manuel L. Quezon had the opportunity to visit the house in 1913 as a guest of General Fitzhugh. He was impressed by the structure and design of the Residence, and openly expressed a wish to have a similar building for an Embassy when the Philippines obtained its independence.\n\nIn 1941, the Brittens bought the property from the widow of Gen. Fitzhugh. In 1946, the Elizaldes purchased the mansion from Mrs. Alma Britten, widow of Congressman Britten.\n\nIn 1949, the Philippine Government bought the property from the Elizaldes. Since then it has become the official residence of succeeding Philippine Ambassadors to the United States.\n\nUnder the initiative of Ambassador Carlos P. Romulo, the Residence underwent renovation in 1953. Filipino architect Victor Teotico re-designed the Residence and conceived a “Philippine Room”, that would house only Philippine items. It was in this room where Philippine President Carlos P. Garcia and US President Dwight D. Eisenhower signed a communiqué embodying Philippine-American friendship and mutual goodwill at the end of the former’s State Visit in June 1958.\n\nThe room is now called “Ambassador’s Filipiniana Room,” where the centerpiece is a 19 x 19 foot mural on one wall portraying life in the Philippines in all its color. The mural, called “Filipiniana”, was painted by Filipino painter Romeo Tabuena. Photographs of all Philippine Ambassadors to the U.S. who lived in the building are placed in this room.\n\nAt the foyer, one will see the glass sculpture donated in 2018 by world-renowned Filipino glass sculptor Ramon Orlina to the Philippine Ambassador. The first flight of stairs leads to a landing and an extended wing used as a tea room.\n\nThe second floor foyer is where the reception line is usually formed. A painting that shows sugarcane harvesting by R. San Miguel hangs on the left side of the room, while a lithograph of a woman being carried is on the opposite wall. A baby grand piano also occupies a section of the room. To the right of the receiving room is the dining room.\n\nTo the left of the receiving room are two adjoining rooms – the French Room and the English Drawing Room. The French Room has an Indian copy of the famous Aubuson rugs. The light color of the rug’s medallion design complements the French wall mural, thus making the room appear larger. The English Drawing Room has a fine Persian rug of rare colors and is decorated by various furniture and paintings by Filipino artists. Private quarters and guest rooms are located on the third floor of the Residence.\n\nMajor renovation works have been completed for the Ambassador’s three-story residence and its two-story carriage house. In 2018, emergency repairs and reinforcement works were done for the backyard retaining wall. In the same year, in an effort to stop the deteriorating condition of the carriage house that has not been used for a very long time, the Embassy installed a new roof and cleared the house of all the trash that had been kept on the first floor of the house.\n\nIn 2019, the wall of the carriage house was repaired and reinforced, as preparation for interior renovation works. In 2020, the entire renovation of the house was completed, including electrical, plumbing and installation of HVAC.\n\nThe Residence did not have a permanent and complete set of furniture and fixtures. Appointed ambassadors would usually bring their own personal properties. In 2021, the Embassy received funding from the Department’s Building Fund Program to fully furnish the Ambassador’s residence.\n\nThe Philippine Ambassador’s Residence is indeed a place of distinction. Rich in history and tradition, it is a witness to the Philippine way of life in an international setting. Like the Old Chancery, the Residence was designated as a National Historical Landmark by the National Historical Commission in the Philippines in 2021."
