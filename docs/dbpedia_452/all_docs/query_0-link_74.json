        "text": "About the PhilSys\n\nRepublic Act No. 11055, otherwise known as the Philippine Identification System Act, aims to establish a single national identification system for all citizens and resident aliens of the Republic of the Philippines. Signed into law by President Rodrigo Roa Duterte in August 2018, the valid proof of identity provided by the PhilSys shall be a means of simplifying public and private transactions, and shall be a social and economic platform that promotes seamless social service delivery and strengthening of financial inclusion for both public and private services. As a foundational digital ID system, the PhilSys will transform how services are delivered and accessed in the Philippines, and accelerate our transition to a digital economy, including to enable presenceless, paperless and cashless transactions.\n\nThe PhilSys project emphasizes inclusive coverage, enabling access to the most vulnerable groups such as the poor, people living in geographically-isolated and disadvantaged areas, indigenous peoples, and persons with disabilities. Built on a Privacy-by-Design principle, the PhilSys will adopt the latest technologies and innovations in the implementation of the project underscoring the importance of privacy of individuals and security of information under the system.\n\nThe PhilSys is envisioned to:\n\nMake services more accessible. PhilSys will be accessible to all Filipinos and its credential will be accepted for most transactions. It will provide access to financial, social protection, health education and other Government services;\n\nPromote ease of doing business. It will provide a platform for the Government and private sector to identify and verify their customer in a digital and automated manner both in-person and online transactions;\n\nEnhance the integrity of services and reducing fraud. PhilSys will uniquely identify each registered person at a national scale with high-level of assurance, eliminate identity fraud and strengthen integrity of functional identification registries;\n\nEnable and promote participation and trust in digital government and the digital economy. PhilSys should enable to broader transition to digital, online citizen-centric service delivery by Government and the private sector; and\n\nEmpower Filipinos with greater control over their personal data. The PhilSys will give PSN-holders the ability to determine who sees what data about them when carrying out transactions using the PhilSys, it will contribute to greater transparency and accountability for how data is used in the Philippines.\n\nA foundational digital ID system, like PhilSys, will contribute to nation building. It will enable the Philippines to move away from inefficient and expensive physical documents, processes and credentials to the use of digital equivalents.\n\nRA 11055 and its IRR\n\nRepublic Act No. 11055, otherwise known as the “Philippine Identification System Act” was signed into law by President Rodrigo Roa Duterte on 06 August 2018.

It is a non-transferable card issued upon successful registration to the PhilSys.\n\nWhen is the registration?\n\nPSA targets to start the registration of the general public by 2021.\n\nWhere do I register?\n\nPSA will establish both fixed and mobile registration centers in strategic locations to register the population to PhilSys. Currently, PSA is in coordination with LGUs, government agencies, and private sector to determine these locations. Further updates on the exact locations of registration centers will be released prior to the opening of PhilSys registration.\n\nWill the PhilID replace other government IDs?\n\nThe PhilID will not replace the existing functional IDs that serve other purposes. The PhilID is a foundational ID which serves as a valid proof of identity which would help ease transactions with both government and private sector through easier validation and authentication of identity.\n\nWhat are the requirements in applying for a PhilID?\n\nThe applicants are advised to present an original copy of at least one (1) of the following:\n\nPrimary Documents:\n\nPSA-issued Certificate of Live Birth AND one (1) government-issued identification document which bears full name, front-facing photograph, and signature or thumb mark.\n\nDFA-issued Philippine Passport or ePassport;\n\nGSIS or SSS-issued Unified Multi-purpose Identification Card (UMID);\n\nLand Transportation Office (LTO)-issued Student’s License Permit or Non-Professional/Professional Driver’s License\n\nSecondary Documents:\n\nPSA-issued Certificate of Live Birth/NSO-issued Certificate of Live Birth with Birth Reference Number (BreN)\n\nLCRO-issued Certificate of Live Birth\n\nPSA-issued Report of Birth\n\nPSA-issued Certificate of Foundling\n\nIntegrated Bar of the Philippines (IBP) Identification Card\n\nProfessional Regulatory Commission (PRC) ID\n\nSeaman’s Book\n\nOverseas Workers Welfare Administration (OWWA) ID\n\nSenior Citizen’s ID\n\nSSS ID\n\nPantawid Pamilyang Pilipino Program (4Ps) ID\n\nLicence to Own or Possess Firearms (LTOPF) ID\n\nNBI Clearance\n\nPolice Clearance/ID\n\nSolo Parent’s ID\n\nPWD ID\n\nVoter’s ID\n\nPostal ID\n\nTaxpayer Identification Number (TIN) ID\n\nPhilhealth ID\n\nPhilippine Retirement Authority (PRA)-issued Special Resident Retiree’s Visa (SRRV)\n\nNational ID from other countries\n\nResidence ID from other countries\n\nThe following identification documents shall be accepted as secondary supporting documents provided that they have a front-facing photograph, signature/Thumbmark, Full Name, Permanent Address, Date of Birth.\n\nEmployee ID\n\nSchool ID\n\nBarangay Clearance/Certificate\n\nBarangay ID\n\nCity/Municipal ID\n\nHow long is the validity of the PhilID?\n\nThe PhilID of Filipinos has no expiration date while the PhilID issued to resident aliens is only valid for one (1) year.\n\nHow much is the PhilID?\n\nThe PhilID is free of charge for the initial issuance for Filipinos. Fee shall only apply for the replacement of the PhilID due to damage or loss. Holders of Certificate of Indigency are exempted from the said fee as long as they present their certificate.\n\nHow will the PSA ensure the data privacy and security of the information being uploaded in the PhilSys?\n\nThe PSA takes seriously the responsibility of ensuring the privacy, security, and integrity of registered persons’ data. Sufficient safeguards shall be in place to ensure information security, cybersecurity, data protection and privacy, including in compliance with the Data Privacy Act.\n\nThe PSA has been working closely with the National Privacy Commission (NPC), the DICT, and the National Security Council regarding the architecture and processes of the PhilSys, including to identify and mitigate privacy and cybersecurity risks.\n\nThe PhilSys design adopts Privacy by Design principles wherein privacy is incorporated into its technologies by default and from the start. For example, the PhilSys collects and stores minimal data and the PhilSys Number (PSN) is fully randomized, not revealing any information about the person such as their date of birth.\n\nWhere can I get further information on PhilSys?\n\nFor further information on PhilSys, you may visit the official website of PSA (https://philsys.gov.ph/ and/or like and follow the official Facebook page of PhilSys: @PSAPhilSysOfficial."
