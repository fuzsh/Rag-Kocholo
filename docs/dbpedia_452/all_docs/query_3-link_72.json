        "text": "What Is Socialism?\n\nSocialism is a populist economic and political system based on collective, common, or public ownership of the means of production. Those means of production include the machinery, tools, and factories used to produce goods that aim to directly satisfy human needs.\n\nIn contrast to capitalism, whereby business owners control the means of production and pay wages to workers to use those means, socialism envisions shared ownership and control among the laboring class.\n\nEssential Features\n\nIn a purely socialist system, all production and distribution decisions are made by the collective, directed by a central planner or government body. Worker cooperatives, however, are also a form of socialized production.\n\nSocialist systems tend to have robust welfare systems and social safety nets so that individuals rely on the state for everything from food to healthcare. The government determines the output and pricing levels of these goods and services.\n\nSocialists contend that shared ownership of resources and central planning provide a more equal distribution of goods and services and a more equitable society.\n\nUnderstanding Socialism\n\nCommon ownership under socialism may take shape through technocratic, oligarchic, totalitarian, democratic, or even voluntary rule. A prominent historical example of a socialist country, albeit one run by communists, is the former Union of Soviet Socialist Republics (USSR), also known as the Soviet Union.\n\nDue to its practical challenges and poor track record, socialism is sometimes referred to as a utopian or “post-scarcity” system, although modern adherents believe it could work if only properly implemented.\n\nThey argue that socialism creates equality and provides security—a worker’s value comes from the amount of time they work, not in the value of what they produce—while capitalism exploits workers for the benefit of the wealthy.\n\nIdeals\n\nSocialist ideals include:\n\nProduction for use, rather than for profit\n\nAn equitable distribution of wealth and material resources among all people\n\nNo more competitive buying and selling in the market\n\nFree access to goods and services\n\nAs an old socialist slogan describes it, “From each according to ability, to each according to need.”\n\nHistory of Socialism\n\nSocialism as a system of shared resources and collective production dates back to the earliest human civilizations. Tribal or clan-based societies would often work for the common good and work together to produce enough food and supplies for the entire population.\n\nCollective agriculture persisted for thousands of years. This was replaced in many places by a sort of feudal system, whereby landed nobility (lords) ruled over peasants (serfs) who worked the land without owning it.\n\nSocialism’s Deep Roots\n\nSocialism’s intellectual roots date back to “Plato’s Republic,” in which he described a collective society. Centuries later, Thomas More’s “Utopia” echoed Platonic ideals in its depiction of an imaginary island where people live and work communally.\n\nSocialism was a direct response to the Industrial Revolution, which brought enormous economic and social change to Great Britain and the rest of the world. As industrialists grew wealthy on the labor of workers who increasingly lived in poverty, socialism emerged as an alternative to capitalism, one that could improve life for the working class.\n\nModern Socialism\n\nModern socialism developed in opposition to the excesses and abuses of liberal individualism and capitalism.\n\nUnder early capitalist economies during the late 18th and 19th centuries, western European countries experienced industrial production and compound economic growth at a rapid pace. Some individuals and families rose to riches quickly, while others sank into poverty. Capitalism created income inequality and spurred other social concerns.\n\nThe most famous early socialist thinkers were Robert Owen and Henri de Saint-Simon, and later Karl Marx and then Vladimir Lenin. It was primarily Lenin who expounded on the ideas of earlier socialists and helped bring socialist planning to the national level after the 1917 Bolshevik Revolution in Russia.\n\nFollowing the failure of socialist central planning in the former Soviet Union and Maoist China during the 20th century, many modern socialists adjusted to a high regulatory and redistributive system sometimes referred to as market socialism or democratic socialism.\n\nSocialism vs. Capitalism\n\nCapitalist economies (which today are often synonymous with the free-market or market economies) and socialist economies differ by their logical underpinnings of the structures of ownership and production.\n\nSocialists and free-market economists tend to agree on fundamental economics—the supply and demand framework, for instance—while disagreeing about its proper adaptation and how commodities should be produced.\n\nFunctionally, socialism and free-market capitalism are often divided on two core issues: property rights and control of production. In a capitalist economy, private individuals and enterprises own the means of production and have the right to profit from them. Private property rights are taken very seriously and apply to nearly everything.\n\nIn a purely socialist economy, the collective owns and controls the means of production; personal property is allowed, but in the form of consumer goods. Essential services like healthcare, education, and public transportation are administered for free by the government and funded through taxation.\n\nDifferences in Control\n\nIn a socialist economy, public officials known as central planners may control the behavior of producers, consumers, savers, borrowers, and investors by taking over and regulating trade, the flow of capital, and other resources. In a free-market economy, trade is conducted on a voluntary, or nonregulated, basis. However, there are many other ways to coordinate production in a collectivist fashion without such dominating control and loss of personal autonomy.\n\nThe Individual vs. the Central Planner\n\nMarket economies rely on the separate actions of self-determining individuals to determine production, distribution, and consumption. Decisions about what, when, and how to produce are made privately and coordinated through a spontaneously developed price system, and prices are determined by the laws of supply and demand.\n\nProponents say that freely floating market prices direct resources toward their most efficient ends. Profits are encouraged and drive future production.\n\nSocialist economies rely on either the government or worker cooperatives to drive production and distribution. Consumption is regulated, but it is still partially left up to individuals. The state determines how main resources are used and taxes wealth for redistributive efforts.\n\nSocialist economic thinkers consider many private economic activities to be irrational, such as arbitrage or leverage, because they do not create immediate consumption or use. Still, Marx saw that capitalism was rife with contradictions, class conflict, and self-destructive competition. As a result, he saw socialism as the logical next phase of human political economy.\n\nSocialism vs. Communism\n\nSimilarities\n\nCommunism and socialism are umbrella terms referring to two left-wing schools of economic thought. Both oppose capitalism, but socialism predates the “Communist Manifesto,” an 1848 pamphlet by Marx and Friedrich Engels, by a few decades.\n\nThey are both economic philosophies that advocate for public ownership, particularly over the means of production and the distribution and exchange of goods in a society.\n\nAnd both philosophies run contrary to free-market capitalism, which, they contend, exploits workers and creates a widening gap between rich and poor.\n\nDifferences\n\nThere are differences between socialism and communism, however. In fact, communism can be thought of as a strict and all-encompassing version of socialism.\n\nUnder communism, all property is communally owned; private property doesn’t exist. Under socialism, individuals can still own private property.\n\nMarx predicted that a violent worker uprising against the middle and upper classes would bring about the communist state, whereas socialists tend to seek change and reform without overthrowing the prevailing social and political structure.\n\nAnd, according to communist theory, workers should be given what they need, while under socialist theory, they are to be compensated for their level of contribution to the economy.\n\nContention Between Socialists and Capitalists\n\nSocialist Claims\n\nThere are many points of contention between socialists and capitalists. Socialists consider capitalism and the free market to be unfair and possibly unsustainable. Most socialists contend that market capitalism is incapable of providing enough subsistence to the lower classes. They contend that greedy owners suppress wages and seek to retain profits for themselves.\n\nCapitalist Claims\n\nProponents of market capitalism counter that it is impossible for socialist economies to allocate scarce resources efficiently without real market prices. They claim that the resultant shortages, surpluses, and political corruption will lead to more poverty, not less. Overall, they say, socialism is impractical and inefficient, suffering in particular from two major challenges.\n\nThe first challenge for socialism, widely called the “incentive problem,” is that no one wants to be a sanitation worker or to wash skyscraper windows. That is, socialist planners cannot incentivize laborers to accept dangerous or uncomfortable jobs without violating the equality of outcomes.\n\nFar more serious is the calculation problem, a concept originating from economist Ludwig von Mises’ 1920 article “Economic Calculation in the Socialist Commonwealth.”\n\nSocialists, wrote Mises, are unable to perform any real economic calculation without a pricing mechanism. Without accurate factor costs, no true accounting may take place. Without futures markets, capital can never reorganize efficiently over time.\n\nCan a Country Be Both Socialist and Capitalist?\n\nWhile socialism and capitalism seem diametrically opposed, most capitalist economies today have some socialist aspects. Elements of a market economy and a socialist economy can be combined into a mixed economy.\n\nIn fact, most modern countries operate with a mixed economic system; government and private individuals both influence production and distribution.\n\nEconomist and social theorist Hans-Hermann Hoppe wrote that there are only two archetypes in economic affairs—socialism and capitalism—and that every real system is a combination of these archetypes.\n\nBut because of the archetypes’ differences, there is an inherent challenge in the philosophy of a mixed economy and it becomes a never-ending balancing act between predictable obedience to the state and the unpredictable consequences of individual behavior.\n\nHow Mixed Economies Develop\n\nMixed economies are still relatively young, and theories around them have only recently been codified. “The Wealth of Nations,” Adam Smith’s pioneering economic treatise, argued that markets were spontaneous and that the state could not direct them or the economy.\n\nLater economists, including Jean-Baptiste Say, F.A. Hayek, Milton Friedman, and Joseph Schumpeter, would expand on this idea.\n\nHowever, in 1985, political economy theorists Wolfgang Streeck and Philippe C. Schmitter introduced the term “economic governance” to describe markets that are not spontaneous but have to be created and maintained by institutions. To pursue its objectives, the state needs to create a market that follows its rules.\n\nFrameworks for Mixed Economies\n\nHistorically, mixed economies have followed two trajectories:\n\nThe first trajectory assumes that private individuals have the right to own property, produce, and trade. State intervention has developed gradually, usually in the name of protecting consumers, supporting industries crucial to the public good (in fields like energy or communications), providing welfare, or other aspects of the social safety net. Most Western democracies, such as the United States, follow this model.\n\nThe second trajectory relates to states that evolved from pure collectivist or totalitarian regimes. Individuals’ interests are considered a distant second in importance to state interests, but elements of capitalism are adopted to promote economic growth. China and Russia are examples of the second model.\n\nSocialist Countries\n\nChina\n\nToday, very few countries are close to pure socialism. Perhaps China is the most prominent example, with a communist government that effectively nationalizes many of the nation’s key industries.\n\nState-owned enterprises are a key feature of the Chinese economy, although several steps toward capitalism and liberalization have created certain economic zones (e.g., in Shanghai) where private corporations can co-exist and profit.\n\nCuba\n\nCuba remained closer to a Marxist-Leninist socialist economy, following its communist revolution in 1959 and the installation of Fidel Castro as its leader. After Castro’s death, however, Cuba, too, saw some liberalization.\n\nIn 2019, Cubans voted for a new constitution that granted private property rights and greater access to free markets, while preserving the socialist political system.\n\nNorth Korea\n\nThe last remaining Marxist-Leninist socialist economy that has not seen any reforms is that of North Korea. The country remains ruled by a communist dictatorship and a closed command economy governed by strict central planning.\n\nLaos, another country in Asia, is also a socialist state, but is more open than North Korea.\n\nTransitioning from Socialism\n\nA nation needs to transfer the means of production to transition from socialism to free markets. The process of transferring functions and assets from central authorities to private individuals is known as privatization.\n\nPrivatization occurs whenever ownership rights transfer from a coercive public authority to a private actor, whether it is a company or an individual.\n\nDifferent forms of privatization include contracting out to private firms, awarding franchises, and the outright sale of government assets, or divestiture.\n\nContracting Government Control\n\nIn some cases, privatization is not really privatization. Case in point: private prisons. Rather than completely ceding a service to competitive markets and the influence of supply and demand, private prisons in the United States are actually just a contracted-out government monopoly.\n\nThe scope of functions that form the prison is largely controlled by government laws and executed by government policy. It is important to remember that not all transfers of government control result in a free market.\n\nPrivatizing a Socialist Economy\n\nSome nationwide privatization efforts have been relatively mild, while others have been dramatic. The most striking examples include the former satellite nations of the Soviet Bloc after the collapse of the USSR and the modernization of the post-Mao Chinese government.\n\nRequired Reforms\n\nThe privatization process involves several different kinds of reforms, not all of them completely economic.\n\nEnterprises need to be deregulated and prices need to be allowed to flow based on microeconomic considerations.\n\nTariffs and import/export barriers need to be removed.\n\nState-owned enterprises need to be sold.\n\nInvestment restrictions must be relaxed.\n\nState authorities must relinquish their individual interests in the means of production.\n\nThe logistical problems associated with these actions have not been fully resolved, and several different theories and practices have been offered throughout history.\n\nPitfalls of Change\n\nShould these transfers be gradual or immediate? What are the impacts of shocking an economy built around central control? Can firms be effectively depoliticized?\n\nAs the struggles in Eastern Europe in the 1990s show, it can be very difficult for a population to adjust from complete state control to suddenly having political and economic freedoms.\n\nIn Romania, for example, the National Agency for Privatization was charged with the goal of privatizing commercial activity in a controlled manner. Private ownership funds, or POFs, were created in 1991.\n\nThe state ownership fund, or SOF, was given the responsibility of selling 10% of the state’s shares each year to the POFs, allowing prices and markets to adjust to a new economic process.\n\nBut initial efforts failed as progress was slow and politicization compromised many transitions. Further control was given to more government agencies and, over the course of the next decade, a bureaucracy took over what should have been a private market.\n\nThese failures are indicative of the primary problem with gradual transitions. When political actors control the process, economic decisions continue to be based on noneconomic justifications.\n\nA quick transition may result in the greatest initial shock and the most initial displacement, but it results in the fastest reallocation of resources toward the most valued, market-based ends.\n\nThe Bottom Line\n\nThe economic and political system of socialism has been a part of human existence, in theory or practice, for many centuries. It espouses the collective ownership of the means of production and places the importance of state control above that of the individual.\n\nProponents believe that it creates equality and provides workers with security. Critics claim that it neglects essential human behavior. Socialism contrasts with capitalism, a system based on a free-market economy and private ownership."
