==Tagalog Republic (1897-1898)==

The '''Tagalog Republic''' was a revolutionary government that existed from 1897 to 1898 in the Philippines. In an alternate history, Andres Bonifacio emerged victorious at the Tejeros Convention in 1897, allowing him to establish a republican system of government prior to the Spanish-American War and Philippine Declaration of Independence.

===Background===

In the late 1890s, the Philippine Revolution was underway aiming to overthrow Spanish colonial rule. The two largest revolutionary organizations were the Katipunan led by Andres Bonifacio and the Magdalo faction of the Philippine Revolutionary Army led by Emilio Aguinaldo. Tensions grew between the two leaders, culminating in the historic Tejeros Convention of 1897 which aimed to unite the revolution under one leader and establish a revolutionary government.

===Government and Constitution===

Upon his election at Tejeros, Bonifacio moved quickly to formally inaugurate the Tagalog Republic and draft a revolutionary constitution. The government was established as a unitary republic with its capital in Kalookan. Executive power was held by the President as head of state and government.

The 1897 Tagalog Constitution enshrined republican ideals of popular sovereignty, separation of powers, civil liberties, and an independent judiciary. It established a parliamentary system of government with a unicameral Chamber of Representatives. Universal adult male suffrage was instituted. The constitution mentioned establishing a bicameral legislature in the future once independence was achieved.

===Cabinet of the Tagalog Republic===

To lead the new republican government, Bonifacio selected a diverse cabinet of talented revolutionaries. Key cabinet positions included:

Prime Minister: Andres Bonifacio - As President, Bonifacio also held the role of head of government as Prime Minister.

Secretary of Interior: Emilio Jacinto.

Secretary of Foreign Affairs: Apolinario Mabini.

Secretary of War: Pio Valenzuela.

Secretary of Finance: Gregorio del Pilar.

Secretary of Justice: Teodoro Plata.

This cabinet blended Bonifacio's loyalists from the Katipunan with talented figures like Mabini and Jacinto who formerly had reservations about Bonifacio's leadership. Their diverse skills and backgrounds helped strengthen the young republic.

===Policies and Reforms===

Under Bonifacio's leadership, the Tagalog Republic implemented reforms to strengthen the revolution and lay the foundations of an independent nation:

- The republic asserted sovereignty over territory liberated from Spain, establishing provincial and local governments.

- A centralized regular army was formed out of the various revolutionary militias, improving command and control under Secretary Valenzuela.

- Secretary Jacinto oversaw universal primary education reforms, establishing new schools across liberated areas.

- Mabini's diplomacy gained the republic recognition from imperial Germany and the Ottoman Empire, seeking international aid.

- Land reform abolished the hacienda system, distributing land to farmer revolutionaries modeled on the Katipunan's social programs.

- Del Pilar instituted a new currency and tax system, allowing the republic to financially support its growing government and military.

- Secretary Plata's legal reforms centralized the legal system, standardized commercial laws, and protected civil liberties.

These nation-building policies strengthened the Tagalog Republic as a genuine alternative government to Spanish colonial rule in Luzon and parts of the central Philippines in the lead up to the 1898 war.

===Spanish-American War===

In 1898, the Spanish-American War broke out as the United States went to war with Spain over Cuba. Seeing an opportunity, Bonifacio and the Tagalog Republic cabinet agreed on a strategy with Mabini to provoke U.S. intervention in the Philippines by intensifying the revolution.

Secretary of War Valenzuela went on successful campaigns that year, liberating much of Central Luzon including Tarlac, Pampanga, Nueva Ecija and Bulacan. Spanish resistance was weakened significantly prior to the arrival of U.S. forces.

On May 1, 1898, the month after the U.S. victory over Spain, Commodore George Dewey's Asiatic Squadron arrived in Manila Bay and decisively defeated the Spanish Pacific fleet in the Battle of Manila Bay. With this decisive victory, Spain was expelled from the Philippines, finally allowing for Philippine independence after 300 years of colonial rule.

===Proclamation of Independence===

With Spain defeated, Bonifacio and the Tagalog Republic cabinet moved swiftly to proclaim a fully independent Philippine state on June 12, 1898. Independence hero Apolinario Mabini was selected to write the historic Proclamation of Philippine Independence.

Mabini's proclamation declared "the Philippine Islands and their adjacent islands separated from the Spanish Crown and are from now on free and independent...under the name of the Filipino Republic." It established sovereignty, territorial integrity and invited other governments to recognize the new state.

The proclamation was approved by the Chamber of Representatives and read publicly by Secretary Jacinto in Kalookan to roaring crowds. Bonifacio then took the presidential oath of office as the legitimate leader of the independent Filipino Republic. A new era of nationhood had begun for the Philippine people.
