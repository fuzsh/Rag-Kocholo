        "text": "The land debate has been dominating headlines in South Africa since December last year, and in the run-up to the national election in 2019, every politician hoping to win a seat in Parliament has expressed an opinion on the matter. One element that has been almost completely missing from our deafening conversation about who should own South Africa’s land is, ironically, the mention of soil. This is probably because there is very little political capital to be earned from speaking to voters about dirt. Cape Town’s Day Zero and the Vaal River system’s pollution crisis have shown that people can easily be made to care about water, but it is far more difficult to appeal to human emotion on the subject of soil. Lehman Lindeque, former president of the International Erosion…\n\n“After a wave of severe drought-induced food inflation, South African consumers found some relief on the back of a rebound in crop production, with food inflation losing pace since the beginning of 2017. This was supported by low inflation and even disinflation in recent periods in bread and cereals, oils and fats, as well as fruit and vegetables. The sustained positive aggregate food inflation was, however, supported by dynamics in the meat sector. Red meat, specifically, although showing initial signs of recovery, is still experiencing the effects of the 2015/16 drought, further supported by relatively weak exchange rate levels, which in turn maintained attractive export opportunities. In the first quarter of 2018, average meat prices were still exhibiting double-digit inflation. There is, however, a general consensus among analysts and industry experts…\n\nCONFERENCES, WORKSHOPS & EXPOS 4 TO 6 SEPTEMBER No-Till Conference, ATKV Drakensville, Bergville.

IMPORTANT…\n\nA landscape art project, which focuses on agriculture, is taking shape on the farm Boontjieskraal in the Overberg, Western Cape. The project, entitled ‘The Earth’, consists of two giant circles, which have been planted to wheat and canola. Each circle is 100m in diameter. The land art installation, designed by Strijdom van der Merwe, renowned South African landscape artist, explores the fragile interaction between humans, nature and agriculture. Van der Merwe developed this concept for the Faculty of AgriSciences at Stellenbosch University (SU). This unique project is part of the faculty’s centenary celebrations this year. SYMBOLISM The circles were planted among wheat fields. It can be seen from the highway and is increasingly visible due to the good growth of the crops following recent rain. Van der Merwe, who grew up on a farm…\n\n96 YEARS AGO In 1922, it was assumed that condensed milk making in South Africa was not a profitable venture. However, Farmer’s Weekly investigated this claim and determined that there was indeed a gap in the market for this product. “Failures in the past have always been traceable to lack of capital, or lack of experience in manufacture. “The enormous demand for condensed milk in South Africa is shown by the customs returns, which show that the average importations amount to more than 400 000 cases of 48 tins per annum. COST OF MANUFACTURE “The cost of manufacture varies with the organisation and size of the factory, capacity of machinery and the amount of the output. These variations are further modified by the cost of available labour, the price of milk, cane sugar, tin…\n\nZimbabwe has just gone through a gruelling election cycle in which Zanu-PF won an overwhelming two-thirds majority in Parliament, while its leader scraped through with only a decimal point victory. It is an election outcome that will surely have some implications for agriculture in the country particularly, and within the broader region generally. This is because Zimbabwe is one of the key import markets for grain, mostly from Zambia recently, as well as other processed agricultural products, especially from South Africa. Zimbabwe is not the same agricultural powerhouse it was before the fast-track land reform programme, which was implemented in 2000. Now, 20 years later, it remains to be seen if Zimbabwe will emerge to re-establish itself as an agricultural powerhouse. However, after examining the political manifestos of the two main political parties, the…"
