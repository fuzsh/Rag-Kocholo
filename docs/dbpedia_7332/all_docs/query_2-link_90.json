        "text": "From back cover: This excellent book provides new impetus to the academic debate around the assessment criteria of the impact of the broad religious sphere on social development in contemporary South Africa. The volume is exemplary in its interdisciplinary approach and for advancing a new theoretical framework that combines hermeneutical and empirical methods. Indeed, the book sets new standards in the fields of practical theology and sociology of religion. Prof Wilhelm Gräb, Professor of Practical Theology & Director of the Institute of Sociology of Religion and Community Development, Humboldt University, Berlin This book may easily stand out in future as seminal in the way that it promoted the social development debate of the church and its organisational structures from an interdisciplinary focus. The book will not only impact on how the church and religious structures should reach out to address social development themes such as poverty. It will, in turn, facilitate understanding by other disciplines of the role of the church and FBOs, which will encourage them to engage the church and religious structures more meaningfully in pursuing the social development agenda. Prof Antoinette Lombard, Professor of Social Work & Head of the Department of Social Work and Criminology, University of Pretoria This publication makes a significant contribution to the debate about the role of the faith-based sector in social development in post-apartheid South Africa. Its initial positive hypothesis is supported by original interdisciplinary research that paints a realistic picture of organised religion in contemporary South Africa; it also sets new standards for empirical and socially based religious and theological research. As such, it presents an appropriate intellectual response to the social agenda of the “New South Africa”. Dr Ian Nell, Senior Lecturer in Practical Theology, Department of Practical Theology and Missiology & Director of the Unit for Religion and Development Research, Stellenbosch University This book provides valuable theoretical and practical perspectives for critical engagement in the field of development in post-apartheid South Africa. It provides much-needed insight into the contribution of the religious sector while, at the same time, challenging this sector to embrace a more holistic view of development. With its combination of experienced and novice “voices”, the text is a vigorous and commendable example of interdisciplinary collaboration. Prof Jaco Dreyer, Professor of Practical Theology, Department of Practical Theology, University of South Africa\n\nThis article examines the adequacy of the policies of a few selected South African Christian groups on socio-political transformation. I will first examine the role of religion in identifying injustice in South Africa and then the contribution that religion makes to facilitate and nurture dialogue and. I will then scrutinize the different kinds of strategies for the transformation of injustice into justice that are rejected or sanctioned and encouraged, as well as the extent to which religious viewpoints contribute to a general consensus on principles of justice for the new South Africa of the future. These issues will be discussed with reference to four important policy documents concerned mainly with issues of social justice released by various groups of Christians in the last few years. These documents were selected to be representative of the principal political actors in South Africa, and because they all contain definite policies on socio-political justice. These are the documents Kerk en Samelewing, which represents mainstream Afrikaner religious thought; The Kairos Document, and The Road to Damascus, which represent the way that black Christians supportive of democratic opposition groups think, and A Relevant Pentecostal Witness, which is representative of how the traditionally apolitical Pentecostal black Christians have become politicized in South Africa today. Reference is also made to the important Rustenburg Declaration, a document released in late 1990 by the most representative meeting of church leaders ever held in South Africa.\n\nThis article is based on an exploration of the involvement of the Dutch Reformed Church (DRC) at congregational level in the struggle against poverty, unemployment and social injustice in present-day South Africa. The exploration arises from the thesis that South African citizens continue to regard poverty, unemployment and social injustice as the key challenges to be met in order to build a healthy nation. Historically, the DRC acted as a prominent partner of the government to address the basic needs of the poor and the sick, especially among the country’s white population. But the structural and social changes that followed the transformation to the new democratic South Africa impacted significantly on this partnership. This in turn required that the role of the DRC in addressing social issues in the country be revisited. The essential purpose of this article is, firstly, to provide better insight into the nature and extent of the current social services rendered by congregations ...\n\nWithin the South African context, the South African Council of Churches (SACC) played a constructive role in the formation of a democratic society. The SACC was the united voice of the church, and its relationship with civil society made it a major role-player in the dismantling of apartheid and the establishment of democratic rule. While post-apartheid is a time of hope and achievement, the country is facing serious social injustices more than two decades into democratic rule. This shift from apartheid to democracy has resulted in a different relationship between church and state. The relationship between church and state has moved from antagonism and polarisation during the apartheid era to “critical solidarity,” and finally to “critical engagement.” This paper will analyse and evaluate the role of the ecumenical church for social justice in post-apartheid South Africa. It will investigate the reasons for the presumed turning point in the relationship between the church and the st...\n\nThe enforcement of racial segregation during apartheid was aimed not only at regulating public spaces, residential areas and the workforce, but also at shaping the subjectivities of individuals who were socialised to see themselves through the lens of a white racial hierarchy. The ideology of white supremacy and superiority that informed apartheid policy was largely justified using Christonormative epistemologies that sought to legitimate the racial hierarchy as having basis in Holy Scripture and as an extension of God’s will. At the same time, apartheid policy fragmented religious communities, entrenching race as a central component of spiritual subjectivities. Twenty years after the end of apartheid, the legacy of apartheid continues to shape the lives and opportunities of all people living in South Africa, despite many gains made in working towards a non-racial, non-sexist democracy. While much scholarly attention has been paid to postapartheid contexts of work, residency and rec...\n\nSouth Africa is often characterized as a highly religious country since many South Africans consider their religious beliefs to be central to their lives. Although religion is widely believed to be a “non-issue”, these strong religious identifications might, however, play a role in the apparent ethnic resurgence. Consequently, the religious diversity of South Africa should be appropriately accommodated in the post-apartheid regime so as to prevent religion-based conflict. It is generally known that the great majority of South Africans are Christian, but that Christian majority can be further subdivided, giving rise to many religious minorities. The Christian affiliations that one can distinguish are the African Independent Churches, the Dutch Reformed Church, the Roman-Catholic Church, the Methodist Church, the Zion Christian Church, the Anglican Church, the Apostolic Church, the Lutheran Church and the Presbyterian Church. Also the other world religions, like Hinduism, Islam and Judaism, are present (in relatively small numbers). The extensive religious diversity thus revealed underscores further the need for a proper accommodation of that diversity as part of the wider democratization-transformation process after apartheid. This article is structured as follows. A brief review of relevant apartheid practices is followed by an assessment of the constitutional negotiations and the ensuing constitution (1996) in terms of the accommodation of religious diversity and its relation to the equality principle. Some attention is also given to the more or less explicit minority rights provisions. An overview and evaluation of the implementation of the various relevant constitutional provisions finally culminates in a conclusion."
