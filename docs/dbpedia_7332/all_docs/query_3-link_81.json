        "text": "2013 CC season kicked off this weekend. All three matches as close as it gets. Griquas beating the Sharks in Durban, Lions and Cheetahs in a tight cat fight and an impressive young Brutes side looking more impressive then their old S15 side.\n\nMatch reports:\n\nAbsa Currie Cup Premier Division off to a thrilling start\n\nAugust 11, 2013\n\nThe Absa Currie Cup Premier Division lived up to its billing as SA’s premier domestic competition this weekend as the opening round delivered a series of nail-biting encounters, which set the scene for a gripping competition.\n\nGWK Griquas and the Toyota Free State Cheetahs got their campaigns off to positive starts as they registered invaluable away victories, while DHL Western Province and the Vodacom Blue Bulls played to a draw in an epic clash in Cape Town.\n\nSo closely matched were the teams, GWK Griquas pipped the Sharks 32-30 at GrowthPoint Kings Park on Friday night, and on Saturday the Toyota Free State Cheetahs edged the MTN Golden Lions 30-29 at Ellis Park and DHL Western Province and Vodacom Blue Bulls drew 24-24 at Newlands.\n\nDHL Western Province 24 (14) Vodacom Blue Bulls 24 (6)\n\nWestern Province stamped their authority early on and showed fantastic skills to create try-scoring chances, which earned them two converted tries in the first 20 minutes by Gio Aplon and Patrick Howard respectively.\n\nThe Blue Bulls, meanwhile, managed to accumulate only three points in that time thanks to a penalty by flyhalf Tony Jantjies.\n\nWith the home team’s confidence up they continued to create try-scoring chances, but mistakes at crucial times denied the team two possible tries before the break. Jantjies, however, slotted over the second of his four penalties which saw the visitors trail 14-6 at the break.\n\nThe second half proved to be very close despite the home team adding a third try by Nizaam Carr, as their ill-discipline combined with a loser defensive effort saw the Pretoria team claw their way back into the match.\n\nFrancois Venter and Jean Cook crossed the tryline in the last 12 minutes to add to a further two penalties by Jantjies, but the young flyhalf missed a conversion in the dying seconds which denied them a victory.\n\nScorers:\n\nDHL Western Province 24 (14) – Tries: Gio Aplon, Nizaam Carr, Patrick Howard. Conversions: Gary van Aswegen (3). Penalty: Gary van Aswegen. Vodacom Blue Bulls 24 (6) – Tries: Francois Venter, Jean Cook. Conversion: Tony Jantjies. Penalties: Tony Jantjies (4).\n\nMTN Golden Lions 29 (16) Toyota Free State Cheetahs 30 (13)\n\nThe Toyota Free State Cheetahs dominated territory and possession in a physical first half at Ellis Park against the MTN Golden Lions, and they showed their attacking prowess as early as the fifth minute with centre Robert Ebersohn scoring the opening try.\n\nTheir ability to balance their attack between the hard grind up front and innovative running rugby, which proved to be far more effective than the Lions’ aimless kicking on attack, paid off again in the 30th minute with captain Boom Prinsloo diving over the line from a rolling maul to add to a penalty by Riaan Smit minutes earlier.\n\nBut unfortunately for the visitors three first-half penalties by flyhalf Marnitz Boshoff and a fantastic try by in-form centre Stokkies Hanekom following a stunning off-load by Dylan des Fountain allowed the Lions to sneak into a 16-13 lead.\n\nThe Cheetahs continued to pin their hopes of a victory on a balanced effort between the forwards and backs, and this paid off five minutes into the second half as scrumhalf Sarel Pretorius gathered the ball following a strong showing by the forwards to dive over the tryline.\n\nNine minutes later centre Johann Sadie took a gap in the defence following a few phases to earn their bonus point try and a 27-19 lead.\n\nBut with nothing to lose the home team retained possession, and the change in tactics worked well, as it earned them two tries in seven minutes to trail 30-29 with a conversion to come.\n\nUnfortunately for the Lions, however, replacement flyhalf Elton Jantjies pushed the kick to the right, and with that proving to be their last point-scoring opportunity, the team were left heart-broken with a 30-29 defeat.\n\nScorers:\n\nMTN Golden Lions 29 (16) – Tries: Stokkies Hanekom, Ruan Dreyer, Willie Britz. Conversion: Marnitz Boshoff. Penalties: Marnitz Boshoff (4). Toyota Free State Cheetahs 30 (13) – Tries: Boom Prinsloo, Johann Sadie, Robert Ebersohn, Sarel Pretorius. Conversions: Elgar Watts, Riaan Smit. Penalties: Elgar Watts, Riaan Smit.\n\nSharks 30 (20) GWK Griquas 32 (16)\n\nIn Durban the Sharks ill-discipline dealt a huge blow to their hopes of a strong start to the competition.\n\nBoth teams found themselves on the wrong side of the law during what proved to be a tense encounter, but GWK Griquas wing Nico Scheepers’ six penalties to only three by Sharks flyhalf Butch James proved to be decisive in the result.\n\nInterestingly the Sharks outscored the Kimberly side three tries to two – two of which were scored by veteran looseforward Jacques Botes, which contributed immensely to their 20-16 halftime lead.\n\nBut the Scheepers’ accurate boot kept the pressure on in the second half and allowed the team to stay within striking range of a victory despite a try by Springbok wing Lwazi Mvovo.\n\nA try after the final, whistle by Griquas replacement looseforward Carel Greeff, which Scheepers converted, however, sealed the victory.\n\nScorers:\n\nSharks 30 (20) – Tries: Jacques Botes (2), Lwazi Mvovo. Conversions: Butch James (3). Penalties: Butch James (3). GWK Griquas 32 (16) – Tries: Carel Greeff, Marnus Schoeman. Conversions: Nico Scheepers (2). Penalties: Nico Scheepers (6).\n\nNext weekend the action get going:\n\nAugust 2013\n\n16 August Sharks v Golden Lions 17:05 Growthpoint KINGS PARK, Durban\n\n16 August Blue Bulls v Griquas 19:10 Pretoria\n\n17 August Western Province v Free State Cheetahs 18:00 DHL Newlands, Cape Town\n\nGood news for WP is that Schalkie is on his way back and may play some role in this years CC after all his set backs.\n\nSS\n\nCape Town - The signs that Schalk Burger’s return to the playing field could be imminent were strengthened when he joined his Western Province team-mates in training at the High Performance Centre in Bellville on Wednesday, reports the supersport.com website.\n\nIt was announced a few weeks ago that the Springbok flank and Stormers captain would be able to return to gym after shaking off the after-effects of the meningitis that forced him into ICU over Easter as well as the other injuries that have kept him from the playing field over the past year. However, WP assistant coach Robbie Fleck confirmed that Wednesday’s appearance at training was his biggest outdoor session yet as he prepares to launch his comeback.\n\n“Schalk is training hard and he is being put through his paces by fitness adviser Stef du Toit. This was the longest session so far and he is really positive about his progress,” said Fleck.\n\n“He looks on course for a return to the playing field in the second round of the Currie Cup but we are not putting any pressure on Schalk and there is no pressure on us from his side either. We will take it as it comes and hope for the best. Obviously having him involved is a huge boost to WP as he has experience and is so highly respected by all the players.”\n\nDeon Fourie, appointed as skipper for the Currie Cup season, backed up Fleck’s contention that having Burger present was a positive for the team.\n\n“He has a lot of experience and it rubs off on the other players. He has really been missed during his absence,” said Fourie.\n\nAgain some close games\n\nSA Rugby\n\nWP, Blue Bulls remain unbeaten in Premier Division\n\nAugust 18, 2013\n\nDHL Western Province and the Vodacom Blue Bulls this weekend withstood extreme character tests in the Absa Currie Cup Premier Division to leap to the top of the log standings and remain the only unbeaten teams in the series.\n\nIn a thrilling weekend of action, the Sharks produced a spirited performance against the MTN Golden Lions at GrowthPoint Kings Park for a 33-25 victory and the Vodacom Blue Bulls ground out a 15-9 win against GWK Griquas in a penalty-riddled clash at Loftus Versfeld.\n\nOn Saturday DHL Western Province edged the Toyota Free State Cheetahs 15-14 in Cape Town for their first victory following a draw against the Blue Bulls last week.\n\nSharks 33 (20) MTN Golden Lions 25 (17)\n\nEarly penalties for Elton Jantjies and Butch James allowed both teams to get on the scoreboard in the first 10 minutes.\n\nBut two tries in 9 minutes by MTN Golden Lions wing Anthony Volmink, handed them an encouraging lead heading into the second quarter.\n\nThe Sharks strong pack, however, asserted their authority, which set up flank Brynard Stander and centre Heimar Williams to cross the tryline.\n\nThis combined with another penalty by James handed the home team a 20-17 half time lead.\n\nThe Lions edged ahead eight minutes into the second half with flank Jaco Kriel dotting down their third try.\n\nBut their luck turned soon after as Lions fullback Marnitz Boshoff and replacement back Chrysander Botha were denied tries due to infringements in the build-up. In stark contrast the Sharks got the rub of the green with new recruit SP Marais scoring their third try from an intercept, while James and Fred Zeilinga kept the scoreboard ticking with goal kicks, to earn their 33-25 victory.\n\nScorers:\n\nSharks 33 (20) – Tries: Brynard Stander, Heimar Williams, SP Marais. Conversions: Butch James (2), Fred Zeilinga. Penalties: Butch James (3), Fred Zeilinga.\n\nMTN Golden Lions 25 (17) – Tries: Anthony Volmink (2), Jaco Kriel. Conversions: Elton Jantjies (2). Penalties: Elton Jantjies (2).\n\nVodacom Blue Bulls 15 (6) GWK Griquas 9 (6)\n\nThe clash in Pretoria proved to be a stop-start affair with penalties conceded by both teams throughout the match cancelling out any momentum they gained on attack.\n\nThe breakdowns, in particular, proved to be problematic for both teams, as it marked a penalty hotspot for Griquas, while the Blue Bulls conceded several turnovers.\n\nThe Blue Bulls’ scrums were also an area of concern as the team battled to come to grips with the new experimental laws.\n\nGriquas had two shots at goal in quick succession in the first 10 minutes, but wing Nico Scheepers missed, which resulted in a change of kickers early on for the Kimberley team.\n\nVodacom Blue Bulls flyhalf Tony Jantjies had the first say as he kicked his team into a 3-0 lead and slotted over another on the stroke of half time to match Francois Brummer’s tally of two.\n\nBlue Bulls fullback Jurgen Visser, however, took over the kicking duties minutes into the second half and slotted over three of his four attempts, while Brummer had only one shot in the second half, which handed the home team a 15-9 victory.\n\nScorers:\n\nVodacom Blue Bulls 15 (6) – Penalties: Jurgen Visser (3), Tony Jantjies (2).\n\nGWK Griquas 9 (6) – Penalties: Francois Brummer (3).\n\nDHL Western Province 15 (10) Toyota Free State Cheetahs 14 (14)\n\nIn Cape Town the Cheetahs started their clash against DHL Western Province with a bang as flyhalf Elgar Watts and wing Riaan Smit ran in tries in the first 16 minutes for a 14-0 lead.\n\nThis convincing start by the visitors immediately pumped the necessary urgency in the home team’s game.\n\nThey bounced back strongly with flyhalf Gary van Aswegen slotting over a penalty and converting a try by Michael Rhodes two minutes later to reduce the gap on the scoreboard to four points.\n\nThe second half proved to be epic as the teams did not give an inch on defence. Smit had an opportunity to extend his team’s lead to seven points, but he pushed a penalty wide leaving the score at 14-10 with 14 minutes to go.\n\nWP’s determined efforts on attack, however, paid off in the 75th minute as inspirational captain Deon Fourie crossed the chalk for the winning try.\n\nScorers:\n\nDHL Western Province 15 (10) – Tries: Deon Fourie, Michael Rhodes. Conversion: Gary van Aswegen. Penalty: Gary van Aswegen.\n\nToyota Free State Cheetahs 14 (14) – Tries: Elgar Watts, Riaan Smit. Conversions: Elgar Watts, Riaan Smit.\n\nSA Rugby\n\nThe Absa Currie Cup Premier Division is expected to heat up this weekend as the teams begin to settle and new player combinations gel after two rounds of matches.\n\nGiven how closely matched the teams are and their familiarity with each other’s strengths and weaknesses, however, the clashes are again expected to come down to the wire.\n\nThe Toyota Free State Cheetahs host the Sharks at the Free State Stadium in Bloemfontein on Friday, and on Saturday GWK Griquas host DHL Western Province in Kimberley in their first home match. Also on Saturday, the Vodacom Blue Bulls go up against the MTN Golden Lions at Loftus Versfeld in the Gauteng derby.\n\nToyota Free State Cheetahs vs The Sharks\n\nThe forward battle in Bloemfontein is expected to take centre stage following mixed fortunes for the teams in the set pieces last week. The Sharks pack were instrumental in putting the team on their front foot against the Lions, while the Toyota Free State Cheetahs’ forwards found themselves under pressure in the scrums against Western Province. But with the Bloemfontein team welcoming back Springbok prop Trevor Nyakane, they will be banking on a better showing in the set piece. The Sharks, meanwhile, will be bolstered by the presence of hard-running loose forward Keegan Daniel, which will add extra flair up-front.\n\nWith the likes of exciting backs Robert Ebersohn, Raymond Rhule and Sarel Pretorius serving as attacking threats for the Cheetahs, the Sharks will have to tighten up their defence after leaking two early tries last week.\n\nToyota Free State Cheetahs:Hennie Daniller; Riaan Smit, Johann Sadie, Robert Ebersohn, Raymond Rhule; Elgar Watts, Sarel Pretorius; Philip van der Walt, Lappies Labuschagne, Boom Prinsloo (Capt); Lood de Jager, Teboho Mohoje; Trevor Nyakane, Hercu Liebenberg, Caylib Oosthuizen. Replacements: Ethienne Reynecke, Rossouw de Klerk, Freddie Ngoza, Davon Raubenheimer, Kevin Luiters, Willie du Plessis, Piet Lindeque.\n\nThe Sharks:SP Marais; Sizo Maseko, Louis Ludik, Heimar Williams, Lwazi Mvovo; Fred Zeilinga, Charl McLeod; Jacques Botes ( Capt), Jean Deysel, Keegan Daniel; Marco Wentzel, Edwin Hewitt; Wiehahn Herbst, Kyle Cooper, Dale Chadwick. Replacements: Craig Burden, Rayno Gerber, Peet Marais, Lubabalo Mtembu, Cobus Reinach, Butch James, Jaco van Tonder.\n\nReferee: Jason Jaftha\n\nAssistant Referees: Jaco van Heerden, Pieter Janse van Vuuren\n\nTMO: Deon van Blommestein\n\nGWK Griquas vs DHL Western Province\n\nThe dry conditions and hard field in Kimberley will certainly test DHL Western Province when they line up against the GWK Griquas on Saturday, as they have been training on heavy and wet fields in Cape Town. This should give the home team an edge. But Pote Human’s team will have to stand their ground against a quality WP outfit to bounce back from their defeat last week. Their discipline, in particular, has to improve, especially at the breakdowns, as it cost them dearly against the Blue Bulls, while their defence also has to be solid to contain the likes of Springboks Juan de Jongh and Gio Aplon.\n\nWith both teams have been strong in the scrums, the set piece could be decisive.\n\n“We know it’s going to be a massive battle,” said Western Province coach Allister Coetzee. “For us it’s about building momentum and not letting slip the things that we’ve improved on last week. That’s what consistency is about and that’s what you need in this competition whether you’re at home or away.”\n\nGWK Griquas: PJ Vermeulen; Nico Scheepers, JP Nel, Howard Mnisi, Rocco Jansen; Francois Brummer, Marnus Hugo; Leon Karemaker, Hilton Lobberts, Carel Greeff; Jonathan Adendorf, Jaco Nepgen, Nico Schonert, Ryno Barnes (Capt), Steph Roberts. Replacements: Matthew Dobson, Brummer Badenhorst, RJ Liebenberg, Burger Schoeman, Jacques Coetzee, Du Randt Gerber, Richard Lawson.\n\nDHL Western Province: Gio Aplon; Gerhard van den Heever, Juan de Jongh, Damian de Allende, Cheslin Kolbe; Kurt Coleman, Louis Schreuder; Nizaam Carr, Rynhardt Elstadt, Deon Fourie; De Kock Steenkamp, Michael Rhodes; Pat Cilliers, Scarra Ntubeni, Steven Kitshoff. Replacements: Tiaan Liebenberg, Brok Harris, Gerbrandt Grobler, Rohan Kitshoff, Nic Groom, Tim Swiel, Ryan Nell.\n\nReferee: Sindile Mayende\n\nAssistant Referees: Ben Crouse, Francois de Bruin\n\nTMO: Gerrie Coetzee\n\nVodacom Blue Bulls vs MTN Golden Lions\n\nAt Loftus Versfeld the Vodacom Blue Bulls will be looking to string together a solid performance following their penalty-riddled clash against Griquas last week, while the MTN Golden Lions will place an emphasis on using all their try-scoring chances after wasting three opportunities against The Sharks last weekend. With both teams featuring strong packs and quality backs, the clash should prove to be entertaining. That said, however, the Pretoria team will have to improve their scrums and breakdowns to maintain their unbeaten run.\n\nThe clash will be significant for Blue Bulls hooker Bongi Mbonambi, who earns his first start in place of the injured Callie Visagie, while Springbok hooker Bandise Maku will start on the bench following his return to Pretoria from the Southern Kings. Loose forward Jacques Engelbrecht could also make his debut as a replacement for the injured Jean Cook, should he take to the field.\n\nCommenting on the clash Blue Bulls coach Pine Pienaar said: “We have played well in patches this far and we now need to produce a more lasting effort. The Lions have a lot of momentum and have played as a unit for a while now, so we will need to counter that by playing as a team. I am happy to call on the likes of Bandise and Jacques as they have slotted in very well and I am sure they will make a telling contribution off the bench.”\n\nVodacom Blue Bulls: Jürgen Visser; Sampie Mastriet, Ulrich Beyers, Francois Venter, Travis Ismaiel; Tony Jantjies, Ruan Snyman; Jono Ross (Capt), Jacques du Plessis, Wiaan Liebenberg; Grant Hattingh, Paul Willemse; Werner Kruger, Mbongeni Mbonambi, Morné Mellett.
