        "text": "With the new Super Rugby season looming large on the horizon we take a look at each of the 15 competitors. Next up, the Cheetahs!\n\nWith the new Super Rugby season looming large on the horizon we take a look at each of the 15 competitors. Next up, the Cheetahs!\n\nAfter setting the bar very high last year, the Cheetahs will be hard-pressed to make the play-offs again.\n\nLast Year: The surprise package of 2013, the Cheetahs enjoyed their best-ever season, finishing second in the South Africa conference and sixth on the overall table. Losing to the Brumbies in the play-offs, by just two points, after a missed conversion in the dying seconds brought a heartbreaking end to an entertaining campaign.\n\nConsecutive wins overseas against the Highlanders, Waratahs and Force in a five-game winning streak that also saw the Stormers beaten in Bloemfontein heralded the start of a new era for the Free Staters – never again will they be underestimated.\n\nThe Cheetahs have always been a dangerous attacking team but their success in 2013 was thanks to the massive improvement in their defence. The one disappointment was their inconsistent form at home – where they won just 63 percent of their games, the worst record of the top six teams.\n\nThis year: As always, the biggest problem at the Free State Stadium is the exit turnstile, which always revolves much faster than the one at the entrance. Luckily coach Naka Drotske has been able to hang onto some of his stars during the offseason, but the departures of Piet van Zyl and Robert Ebersohn will hurt.\n\nSquad depth has always been an issue and once again the Cheetahs' fortunes will depend heavily on keeping certain key players – like skipper Adriaan Strauss – fit. Heinrich BrÃ¼ssow is already crocked but fortunately the back row is one place where the Cheetahs are relatively well stocked.\n\nIt will be interesting to see how the team does without defence coach Michael Horak, who is leaving for the Kings and will not be replaced. He was still around for the warm-up games – against Shimlas, Kings and Pumas – in which only three tries were conceded. Drotske says the defensive system is now in place and the other coaches will take over where Horak left off. On the attacking front, the good news is that fly-half Johan Goosen – who many regard as South Africa's most creative 10 – is back from another long injury lay off, which is a significant boost.\n\nThe draw sees the Cheetahs dealt a tough overseas tour early in the campaign before returning to host back-to-back games against the Chiefs and Crusaders. They won't play two of the teams they beat last year, the Waratahs and the Highlanders, at all. A challenging season lies ahead.\n\nPlayers to watch: Springbok utility back Willie le Roux is the most exciting outside back in South Africa. Despite making his mark at right wing last year, he has asked to play at full-back in 2014 as he looks to cement himself a berth in the national side (JP Pietersen and Bryan Habana are set to be the Bok wings). Whatever number he has on his back, expect Le Roux to pop up all over the show as he has been given licence to roam. Shaun Venter is an exciting scrum-half, who is “going to surprise a few people this year” according to Drotske. All eyes will be on Johan Goosen, who was has hailed as the next great Bok fly-half until injury ruined his season last year. Lappies Labuschagne is banging hard of the Springbok selectors' door.\n\nNoteworthy signings: Cornal Hendricks (SA Sevens), Francois Venter (Bulls), Shaun Venter (Kings), Jean Cook (Bulls), Piet Lindeque (Sharks)\n\nNoteworthy departures: Lourens Adriaanse (Sharks), Robert Ebersohn (Montpellier), Burton Francis (Agen), Frans Viljoen (Lyon), Piet van Zyl (Bulls)\n\nProspects: The Cheetahs are always a sure bet to put on a show and neutral fans would love to them repeat last year's heroics. But we're not sure that will be possible. The draw has not been kind. Mid-table is the most likely conclusion, but the playoffs may be just out of reach.\n\nFixtures:"
