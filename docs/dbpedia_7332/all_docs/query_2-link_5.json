        "text": "Watch: Grey College boys perform their war cry as Wayde van Niekerk receives his honorary “Grey Pin”\n\n625\n\nGrey College boys are going viral for performing their war cry in a special assembly for ex-pupil Wayde van Niekerk, who received his honorary “Grey Pin”.\n\nSouth Africa (10 May 2017) – South Africa’s Olympic gold medallist Wayde van Niekerk has become a true inspiration for all, the principal of Grey College Secondary School in Bloemfontein has said.\n\n“We, as Grey College, are extremely proud of Wayde van Niekerk’s achievement. He is humble about his achievements and a true inspiration for all,” said principal Deon Scheepers.\n\nScheepers also hailed Van Niekerk as a true “Grey gentleman”.\n\nVan Niekerk, who matriculated from the school in 2011, won Team South Africa’s first gold medal at the 2016 Rio Olympics after finishing the men’s 400m final in 43.03 seconds on Monday morning.\n\nMeanwhile, head of sport and athletics at Grey College and one of Wayde’s former teachers, Piet Viljoen said Van Niekerk had achieved his gold medal in a humble way.\n\n“He was a very humble, well-mannered disciplined learner with a lot of faith when it came to achievements and injuries.\n\n“He has become an example and a motivation for our pupils that it is possible to be great and to excel,” said Viljoen.\n\nOn Tuesday morning, the school held a special assembly for its pupils honouring van Niekerk with his own “Grey Pin”. The students performed an emotional war cry that is sure to give you goosebumps.\n\nWatch the incredible videos below:\n\nSources: Facebook | News24\n\nDon’t ever miss the Good Things.
