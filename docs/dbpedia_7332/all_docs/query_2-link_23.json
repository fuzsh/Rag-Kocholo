For 2018 the competition has been expanded to include 12 additional schools from the Xhariep District in addition to the 8 from Botshabelo and Bloemfontein.\n\nThe Xhariep region has been divided in two: East which includes Zastron, Reddersburg, Edenburg, Trompsburg, Bethulie and Gariepdam and West which includes Petrusburg, Jagersfontein, Koffiefontein, Philippolis and Fauresmith.\n\nThe competition started in April and was played in three leagues - each region playing in their own league with a final.

The program is safe for all and cleverly formulated that a rugby field is not required to complete the course. All activities can be done on the playground or hard surface without any contact. All coaches are reimbursed by World Rugby.\n\nTAG\n\nAll u.9 players play Tag Rugby and focus on basic rugby skills before moving over to contact rugby in a later age group.\n\nContact info@fsrugby.co.za"
