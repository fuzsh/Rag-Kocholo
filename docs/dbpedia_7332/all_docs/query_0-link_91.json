Through this series it will be possible to both record and commemorate the role of the many hitherto unacclaimed people whose past work and struggle have contributed so much to the future of our nation. Knowledge of our past deepens our wisdom to plan our future. But history is not created in books. It is a record of human endeavour. It is, therefore, vital that the lives of all the South Africans who have made some contribution to our rich heritage, whether they were politicians, educators, scientists or workers, be brought to the fore. In this way they become part of that most valuable of resources: information and collected wisdom which is fundamental to the empowerment of both the learned and the learner. Africa and its past are intensively researched in overseas countries. Numerous biographical dictionaries and encyclopaedias that cover Africa as a whole have been published. It would have been a sad reflection on the abilities and commitment of our historians and academics if a reference work of this nature were to have originated abroad. We as South Africans best know the background and subtleties of our people. It is therefore fitting that South Africans themselves should be the compilers and researchers of their own achievements and frustrations. A series such as this rescues unsung heroes from oblivion and restores them as role models for our future endeavours. At the same time through thorough research and the test of proven research methodology, it is possible to present their full humanity and save them from being mythologized. This series is the only biographical record on our continent that concentrates on the people of a single country. These are the people on whose shoulders we stand. Nelson R. Mandela President of the Republic of South Africa September 1994 v Copyrighted material INTRODUCTION When the first volume of the Dictionary of South African biography ( DSAB ) was published in 1968, the then editor-in-chief Prof. W.J. de Kock gave the reason for the publication— a need for a work of reference presenting the life histories of people who have made a meaningful contribution to the course of South African history. At that time the objective of the editorial board was to publish a series of biographies of persons who died before the end of 1950, and to deal in a following series with persons who died later. Mainly for logistical reasons it was impossible to keep to the original planning. The third of the five volumes of the DSAB already included people who died after 1950, and by the time the last volume was published, people who died before the end of 1982 were being considered for inclusion. By moving the inclusion date forward from time to time, the series could be continued indefinitely— with the inherent danger of postponing important but demanding pre-1950 biographies in favour of more recent and less taxing ones. The decision to terminate the DSAB after the publication of Volume V in 1987 (at that stage 4 518 biographies had been published) and to embark on the New dictionary of South African biography ( NDSAB ) was taken for two rea- sons— firstly, to adapt to changes in the external environment that seriously reduced the resources available for the continuation of the programme (in fact, threatened its very survival). Secondly, there was a need to reconsider the programme and correct some imbalances. The NDSAB is, however, complemen- tary to the former series. To assist the reader, a cumulative index to Volumes I to V of the DSAB is included in the NDSAB I. The most visible change is in the format. Compared to the average of 900 biographies per volume of the DSAB, the first volume of the NDSAB carries only 129. The layout is also less formidable, and every biography has been illustrated except for those for which no photograph or illustration could be traced, or those for which the illustration material did exist but for which the owners set exorbitant demands. This latter constraint, incidentally, makes a mockery of the much-desired principle of free access to information. Readers who are familiar with the DSAB will also immediately notice the tendency to move away from leaders of the male-dominated white establishment towards extra-parliamentary political leaders who paved the way for broad democratic reform, leaders in all spheres of the marginalized communities, and women who significantly influenced an essentially male-dominated world. A special niche was reserved for people who received international acclaim, or vi Copyrighted material who were pioneers in some way or another. For reasons of historical balance a number of people in leadership positions from the pre-democratic era have also been included. Most of the biographies are approximately of equal length and a deliberate attempt was made to steer away from biographical detail, focusing rather on those aspects of a person’s life that constituted a significant contribution to history. The editor strove to maintain stylistic consistency. To avoid incorrect use, prefixes such as ‘ama-’ or ‘ba-’ were avoided. In some cases the orthography of the previous series was adhered to: the spelling of names such as ‘Sefuneio’ was retained. A special effort was made to remain consistent when repeatedly capturing the same events relative to different political figures. The danger of a boring style had to be braved for the sake of accuracy. Avid readers of the DSAB have waited patiently for this volume. On their behalf and that of the management of the Human Sciences Research Council, I would like to express our sincere appreciation to Elizabeth Verwey who, as editor, so ably guided this first volume of the New dictionary of South African biography through all its phases. On behalf of the editor I would like to thank the following persons for the role they played in producing this volume: • Mart van der Wcsthuizcn, Marie-Louise van Wyk and Annelizc Meintjics of the HSRC Computer Centre; • Buks Groenewald and Isabel Groesbeek of the HSRC Library; • Thys Licbenberg, Heinie Heydenrych, Lucie Moller and Tony Minnaar for professional support and advice, and those mentioned in the source list who gave information telephonically (often after much effort on their part to get the information); • Ina Stahmer and Margaret Whittle-Bennetts for assistance with the linguistic revision of the manuscript; • Jantje Bode for being a pillar of support throughout; • Relatives and friends of the persons included in the book as well as contributors to the NDSAB who lent photographs from their own collec- tions; • Claudia Davidson of the HSRC Publishers for the sensitive guidance in the final stages of this publication.

Smuts*), or in volume one of the New dictionary of South African biography (e.g., Z.R. Mahabane*) viii Copyrighted material A AFRIKANER, Jager (H6a-/arab/) (*Roode Zand (Tulbagh), c.l769-fVrede- berg, in the present-day Namibia, c. July 1822), chief of the Afrikaner-Oorlams and the son of Klaas Afrikaner. (‘Oorlams’ is derived from the Malay word ‘orang lama' meaning ‘old person’ but ‘one who is wise in the ways of the world’. The Oorlam Khoi were so called for their expertise in the hand- ling of horses and firearms. They spoke Cape Dutch and included escaped slaves.) Klaas apparently was an independent cattle farmer in the Witzenberg in the Tulbagh district where he became acquainted with an enterprising farmer Petrus Pienaar*. It is not clear what his rela- tionship with Pienaar was but he later moved with his relatives to Pienaar’s farm. Members of the Afrikaner household often accompanied Pienaar on his hunting trips and travels into the interior— there is evidence, however, that Pie- naar rustled cattle from tribes in the interior on these trips, in time they knew the interior up to the Orange River well. They became adept in the use of guns and horse-riding. In 1790 Klaas Afrikaner, his sons and a few other related Afrikaner families moved with Pienaar to the Hantam (a region on a high plateau in the Calvinia district) where he settled on the loan farm Groot Vlakte. Because of their shrewdness Pienaar included the Afrikaners on punitive expeditions against San cattle rustlers. However, there are allegations that these expeditions were in fact raids on Khoikhoi and Nama tribes in the interior. In 1795 Jager succeeded his father as chief. He was still in his early twenties and known for his bravery and competence. It would appear that the Afrikaners lost their independent status after 1793 and became herders on Pienaar's loan farm. As tension between the whites and the Khoikhoi increased, the Afrikaner-Oorlams also started resisting Pienaar’s master-servant attitude towards them. This came to a head with the killing of Pienaar in March 1796 after a quarrel— possibly over wages or Pienaar’s alleged seduction of Afrikaner women. The Afrikaners fled to the Middle Orange River where they lived on the river islands. From their safe river hide-out Jager led raids on the tribes in the surrounding areas. Soon everyone in a radius of 400 km lived in 1 Copyrighted material fear of him. His followers increased to more than 100 when some Nama and Korana joined him. In 1799 the acting governor of the Cape Colony, H. Dundas*, outlawed Jager after a raid into the Colony and the killing of a white farmer and rustling of his cattle. Because of Jager’s military expertise, the unwillingness of the cattle farmers to take part in punitive expeditions, and probably his elusiveness, he was left unpunished. As a safety measure against the raids of the Afrikaner-Oorlams, some of the Basters (or Bastaards— an eighteenth century term for frontiersmen of mixed race) amalgamated to form the Griqua. In this sense Jager was instrumental in bringing together the Griqua. In about 1 803 Jager and his followers left their hide-out at the Orange River and travelled a day’s journey on horseback to the north, where they settled at Blydeverwacht or Blyde Verwachting in the present-day Namibia. This marked the beginning of the migration of the Oorlams from the Cape Colony to Namibia, which led to the establishment of Cape Dutch as language in the region north of the Orange River. In January 1806 the brothers Albrecht, missionaries of the Berlin Mission- ary Society, moved into Jager’s territory. By this time Jager had apparently tired of his outlaw life which had to a great extent been forced on the Afrika- ners after the final showdown with Petrus Pienaar. Jager was envious of the respectability and stable communities of other leaders such as the Koks*. These leaders all had missionaries staying with them and Jager hoped to achieve some measure of respectability by also allowing missionaries into his territory. He therefore permitted the Albrechts to minister to them— the children received schooling and religious instruction while he and his brother Hendrik attended the services of the missionaries. When the missionaries moved to Warmbad (in Namibia) in October 1806, Jager followed them. However, the Bondelswarts who resided there, did not trust the Afrikaners and requested them to leave. The Afrikaners then settled at Afrikanerskraal, just east of Warmbad. This first attempt of Jager to live in peace and achieve some stability came to an end towards the end of 1810. In retaliation for the illegal sale of some of his cattle, Jager attacked and plundered the mission station of the London Mis- sionary Society at Pella. When he also threatened to attack Warmbad, the mis- sionaries returned to the Cape Colony. By the middle of 1811 Jager had resumed to his previous way of life — raiding and plundering. This lasted till the arrival of a German missionary, Johannes Ebner, at Afrikanerskraal on 10 June 1815. Shortly afterwards, on 23 July 1815, Jager and his brothers Hendrik and Andreas were among the first eight people to be baptized. In deference to the missionary Christiaan Albrect, Jager accepted the name Christiaan and his brother Hendrik the name Dawid— though these name changes probably only occurred later, under the influence of Robert Moffat*. In January 1818 Robert Moffat of the London Missionary Society joined Ebner who shortly afterwards left Afrikanerskraal. Under Moffat’s influence Jager now also learnt to read and write, and encouraged education among his people. The Afrikaner-Oorlams ceased their periodic raids and engaged in hunting and trading. In February 1819 Jager and Moffat travelled to the Cape to request Governor Lord Charles Somerset* to set aside the outlawry. 2 Copyrighted m Moffat now moved to Lattakoo (Dithakong) (about 66 km northeast of Kuruman) as he was assigned mission work among the Tswana, and in June 1820 Jager took Moffat’s cattle and possessions to him at Lattakoo. This meant that the Afrikaner-Oorlams were without a missionary for the first time since their conversion, and that Jager had to act as political and church leader, as well as teacher. In July 1822 Klaas, Jager's father, died and a week later Jager himself died. Shortly before his death he named his second eldest son, Jonker Afrikaner*, as his successor. w.

AGAR-HAMILTON, John August Ion (*Cairo, Egypt, 30 August 1895— tOrahamstown, 16 June 1984), historian and Angli- can priest. He was of Scottish descent and arrived with his parents, John August and Ada Agar-Hamil- ton, in South Africa in 1906. He was educated at Pretoria Boys' High School where he matriculated in 1911. After that he studied for a B.A. degree at the Transvaal University College (University of Pre- toria), graduating in 1914. All sources refer to Agar-Hamilton as having an M.A. degree but it is not clear which university he graduated from. Some sources indicate that he studied at the University of the Cape of Good Hope (University of South Afri- ca), while it is also known that he studied at Keble College at Oxford— though it is not clear when he left South Africa. Sources also differ as to what he studied at Oxford. It is possible that he held masters degrees from both the universities. Agar-Hamilton returned to South Africa in 1923 and was a senior lecturer in history at the University of Pretoria until 1940. In 1941 he was appointed officer-commanding military history records with the rank of lieutenant-colonel. 3 Copyrighted material After the Second World War he became editor-in-chief of the Union war his- tories, a position he held until the war histories were disbanded in 1959. He was ordained as an Anglican deacon in 1955 and served as a curate (probably nonstipendiary, i.e. part-time) at the St Alban’s Cathedral in Pretoria. In 1960 Agar-Hamilton was appointed to the staff of the History Department at Rhodes University in Grahamstown and warden of Matthew's House, one of the uni- versity residences. In the same year he was ordained as an Anglican priest. On the death of Prof. Raymond Burrows in October 1960, Agar-Hamilton was appointed director of the Rhodes University Institute of Social and Economic Research, a post he held until his retirement in 1966. He became the first honorary Fellow of the institute and stayed on as warden of Matthew’s House. In recognition of his contribution to South African military and official history, Rhodes University conferred on Agar-Hamilton an honorary D.Litt. degree in April 1967. After his retirement from academic life, Agar-Hamilton served the Anglican Church as the editor of the church directory and yearbook from 1967 to 1969. From 1969 to 1979 he was a priest in the parish of Christ Church in Grahams- town. In 1980 he retired from the priesthood. Agar-Hamilton came under the influence of George Cory* and was convinced, early in his career, of the need for ‘scientific methods of research’. He also appears to have been an exponent of the early British and Settler his- toriographical school (Cory being a major proponent) suggesting that \"... the history of this country only became interesting after the British came into it\". Being pro-British, he tended to look on nineteenth century Afrikaner institu- tions as inferior to British institutions, doubting if it was possible for any type of government by the Voortrekkers (Afrikaners) to have existed north of the Vaal River between 1840 and 1850. He was opposed to Afrikaner Nationalism and wanted to articulate his opposition but believed that doing so was \"... not as much as my job was worth*. The publication of his book entitled The native policy of the Voortrekkers: an essay in the history of the interior of South Africa, 1836-1858 (London, 1928) created a great deal of interest. Many leading national newspapers, including the Pretoria News, The Cape Times, Die Burger and The Rand Daily Mail, ran articles on this publication. Agar-Hamilton disagreed with W.M. Macmillan’s* views on Dr John Philip* and acquitted the Transvaal govern- ment of practising slavery— two issues relevant in South African historiographi- cal debate at the time. He nevertheless blamed the Transvaal government for their shameless exploitation of and disregard for \"... the fundamental rights of the native people\". He stated that if the Transvaal government could not contain the criminal white elements in their area \"... it clearly forfeited its right to be regarded as a civilised state\". Though under the influence of Cory in his early writings, his attacks on the Afrikaners and defence of the indigenous populations suggest that, for most of his professional career, he was part of the liberal historiographical tradition. It has, however, been noted by some historians that the writing of the war histories prevented Agar-Hamilton from contributing to the further development of a Africanist methodology or conceptualization. 4 Copyrighted material Agar-Hamilton was a prolific researcher and writer and published widely throughout his career. Apart from the publications listed in South African history and historians: a bibliography (1979) he also published Pretoria centenary album: Pretoria’s first centenary in illustration ; These men shaped your world (1961); and Border port: a study of East London (1970). Agar- Hamilton also contributed articles to the Dictionary of South African biography and the Standard encyclopaedia of Southern Africa. Agar-Hamilton is best known for his contribution to the Union war histories. In the citation for an honorary degree at Rhodes University the orator stated that he produced \"... one of the best and most objective of all military histories— and the best of official histories\". In addition to his research and writing, Agar-Hamilton also did a great deal of broadcasting both in South Africa and Britain. He was commissioned to do a series of talks to mark the Union jubilee in 1960. He was well liked by his peers and highly respected professionally. He never married.

ANDRESEN, Hans Olaf YValdemar Rudiger Emmerich Felix Januarius (Olaf) (‘Berlin, Germany, 14 January 1902— tKempton Park, 19 December 1985), composer, mainly of light music, was the son of Waldemar and Anna Andresen. Already as a child Andresen showed musical talent. He studied at the music conservatory of H. and P. Heller in Berlin and received tuition in violin, musical theory and composition. At the age of fourteen he made his debut as violinist. He inter- rupted his studies to take part in the First World War (1914-1918). In 1920 he started a world tour during which he gave performances, composed music and became acquainted with other musicians. His source of income, however, was his work as accountant— he wrote an 5 Copyrighted material accountancy examination in California, United States of America. The last country he visited was South Africa. In 1926 he was back in Germany, but speedily returned to Venezuela where he was a member of a dance band. In 1931 , during the depression, he returned to Germany, but left for South Africa in the same year. Here he covered long distances on foot since he could not afford travel expenses. He made a living as an insurance agent. Eventually he settled in Vryheid, Natal, where he met Marthel Dittrich, whom he was later to marry. At the outbreak of the Second World War (1939-1945) Andresen was interned in the Leeukop camp because of his German nationality. After eight months he escaped and the following eleven months he was on the run. During this time he composed 22 marches and battle songs for the Ossewa-B rand wag under the pseudonym Andries Cilliers. These compositions were published in 1941 in Johannesburg as the Ossewa-Brandwagbundel. He and his fiancee, Marthel, fled to Lourengo Marques (Maputo) in Portuguese East Africa (Mozambique) in 1942. Andresen was allowed to stay there, probably because he had a German passport, but Marthel was sent back to South Africa where she had to serve a prison sentence for her political affiliations. They were married in 1946 in Louren?o Marques, but could only return to Johannesburg in 1948, after the election victory of the National Party. In Johannesburg Andresen became a professional composer. He established his own printing and publishing company, the Melotoongolwe Musiekuitgewers (music publishers). Here he printed and distributed his own compositions and even cut and sold his own gramophone records for several years. Andresen composed nearly 400 works. This included three operettas in Afrikaans: Die heidenooientjie, Die drie astertjies and Die mieliefeetjie. He composed dancing music too, a symphony, and marches adapted for military orchestra by Charles Donne. Out of appreciation for his contribution to music Andresen was appointed honorary colonel of the Regiment East Rand of the South African Defence Force in 1969. Most of his compositions, however, were songs. In 1932 Andresen composed his most famous song, ‘Heidelied’. His inspiration for it stemmed from a hike in the Western Province. The band of Hendrik Susan* performed the song for the first time in 1949 and in that same year it was used during the inauguration of the Voortrekker Monument. It became renowned in New Jersey (USA), as well as in Luneburg (Germany) where the inhabitants invited Andresen and his wife in 1956 to visit the city during its millenary. During this visit the song was proclaimed Song of the Year. The South African Army used it in an adapted form as a march. It was also the theme song in the film Hoor my lied. In the film Krugermiljoene other well-known songs of Andresen were sung by G 6 Korsten, like ‘My hart verlang na die Boland’. Andresen wrote the words for most of his compositions himself, and since he had command of several languages, he published most of his songs in more than one language. Since 1964 Andresen’s health deteriorated; nevertheless, he continued composing. In 1978 he wrote his last composition, an Italian concerto for piano and violin. Andresen first married Johanna Beer. After he had divorced her, he married 6 Copyrighted material Marthel (Martha) Dittrich. He was the father of a son and two daughters.

ARNDT, Ruth Elizabeth (Toronto, Canada, 2 June 1890— tPretoria, 8 Sep- tember 1982), pre-school educationist, was the daughter of Francis Stephens Spence. She studied at the Victoria College of the Uni- versity of Toronto from 1909 to 1913 and obtained her B.A. degree in 1913. The following year she qualified as high school assistant and specialist in modems and history. From 1921 she studied at the Teachers College of Columbia University, New York, and in 1924 the Ph.D. degree in education was conferred on her for her thesis Theory of edu- cation as growth, as formulated by John Dewey. Until the middle of 1926, when she left for South Africa to marry a fellow student from Columbia University, E.H.D. Arndt, she was assistant professor in educational psycholo- gy at Smith College, Northampton, Massachusetts. Arndt’s career in South Africa reflects the influence of two persons in particular. She idolized her father, a reformer who had devoted his life to public service and, secondly, she was imbued with the philosophy and teaching of John Dewey, professor in philosophy during her stay at Columbia Univer- sity. Her professional career in South Africa began in 1929 when she held two relieving appointments at the Pretoria Normal College (Pretoria Teachers’ Training College). In the same year the Transvaal University College (Univer- sity of Pretoria) opened its Child Guidance Clinic, followed by the establish- ment of the School of Social Work. This progressive move and her close contact with the head of the clinic, Dr Marie te Water, gave her much satisfaction and encouragement. In 1930 she returned to Canada for more than a year to study nursery school education. A Laura Spellman (Rockefeller) Travelling Fellowship enabled her to visit the leading training centres in the USA and Canada. Back in South Africa she interested herself in providing facilities for pre-school education in Pretoria, and later virtually became the founder of the nursery school movement in South Africa. The long struggle to gain recognition for pre-school education from government departments and municipalities was ultimately won due to her persistence. Her broad theoretical and academic background ensured that pre-school teaching in South Africa had its roots in 7 Copyrighted material sound educational principles. Arndt was a foundation member of the Nursery School Association of South Africa (Southern African Association for Early Childhood Education, later renamed the Southern African Association for Early Childhood Educare), and served as honorary secretary, chairperson, president and honorary life president. Her presidential addresses to the association delivered from 1940 to 1975, were published in 1977. One seldom finds in one person such a scholarly philosophic background, practical insight and tenacity. That there are today hundreds of institutions catering for the education of thousands of pre-school children of all races in South Africa is a tribute to her. In 1975 she received an honorary doctorate in education from the University of South Africa. The Good Hope Nursery School of which Arndt was a founder member was renamed the Ruth Arndt Early Learning Centre (a crfeche-cum-nursery school in Schubart Street, Pretoria) in living memory of this pioneer of infant care and education in South Africa. A son and a daughter were born of her marriage to E.H.D. Arndt, professor of economics at the University of Pretoria, vice-president of the Reserve Bank, a director of the Land Bank and chairperson of the Decimaliz- ation Board.

ASCHENBORN, Hans Jurgen (*Windhoek, South West Africa (Namibia), 19 August 1920 — fPretoria, 3 October 1986), librarian, the son of Hans Anton Aschenbom*, an artist and author, and his wife Emmy Bredow. Aschenborn’s father decided to return to Ger- many in 1923 (some sources state 1921) for econ- omic reasons. Shortly after his father’s death in 1931 , Aschenborn’s mother returned to South Africa with her children and settled on a farm called Bron- hoft in the Potgietersrus district. Aschenbom received his schooling at the Deutsche Schule in Windhoek, passing his Abitur (matriculation) in 1939. He was interned from 1942 to 1945, during the Second World War (1939-1945), because of his German connections. After his release he was persuaded by Prof. P.C. Coetzee, who was the head of the library of the University of Pretoria at that time, to continue his studies instead of going to Germany to help with the reconstruction of that country after the war. Aschenbom studied through the University of South Africa (Unisa) and obtained a B.A. in 1950 and the Higher Diploma in Librarianship in 1952. In 1957 he obtained a M.A. degree and in 1 966 a doctorate for a dissertation on De Staatsbibliotheek der Zuid-Afrikaan- 8 Copyrighted material sche Pepubliek (The State Library of the Transvaal Republic) was conferred on him. A part-time student, Aschenbom was in the employ of the Merensky Library at the University of Pretoria from 1947 to 1949. In 1949 he joined the Transvaal Provincial Library service where he worked until 1951 when he returned to the Merensky Library. Concurrently, from 1953 to 1961, he was a lecturer in librarianship at the University of Pretoria. In 1959 he was appointed deputy director of the State Library and in 1965 became director— a post he held until his death. Some of the highlights in his career as director of the State Library were: the creation of the Unicat (a joint catalogue arranged according to the Interna- tional Standard Book Number (ISBN)); the computerization and microfilming of the Joint Catalogue of Books; the publishing and computerization of the SANB: South African national bibliography, the commencement of the micro- filming of South African newspapers; the creation of the Government Gazette index (GGI); and the publication of the RSANB: retrospective South African na- tional bibliography. Aschenborn was involved in the drafting of the Legal Deposit of Publications Act of 1982 and the National Libraries Act of 1985. Under the direction of Aschenborn, the State Library started an extensive publication programme which resulted in the reprint series (for example L long land’s Pretoria directory for 1899 and Verrichtinge van het Onderwijs- congress gehouden te Germiston [I899f) and the bibliographical series (such as German Africana and Bibliography of reprography). Aschenborn played a leading role in South African librarianship. He served on the National Library Advisory Council and later on the National Advisory Council for Libraries and Information Science. He played an active role in the South African Institute for Librarianship and Information Science (Sailis) as council member, chairperson of the Committee for Bibliographic Control and the Technical Standards Committee. Aschenborn was also involved in Sabinet (South African Bibliographic and Information Network), the Microfilm Associ- ation of the RSA (Marsa) and the Suid-Afrikaanse Akademie vir Wetenskap en Kuns (South African Academy for Arts and Science). Several of his scholarly articles which were published in local and overseas journals gained South African librarianship international recognition. Further- more, in his professional career he attended approximately 65 international conferences, including several of the International Federation for Library Associations and Institutions (IFLA). He played an important role in the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) and was chairperson of three working groups, namely the Working Group for Microfiche Standards, the Working Group for Microfilming of Newspapers and the Working Group on Book Production Statistics. He also was a member of the Conference of Directors of National Libraries. In 1967 the Canadian Council awarded Aschenborn the John Harvey Medal, and in 1975 he became honorary Fellow of the International Information Management Congress. In 1970 he received the socius membership of the South African Library Association (now Sailis) and in 1985 was awarded the Sailis Award for Bibliography. State President P.W. Botha awarded Aschen- 9 Copyrighted born the Order for Meritorious Service Silver posthumously in 1988. In 1 956 Aschenbom moved to a smallholding near Kameeldrif, northeast of Pretoria, designing and building the house himself. Interested in art, especially typography and graphic art, he tried to have his father’s work reprinted. He was also a well-known breeder of arab horses. His motto was ‘Und immer siegt die Liebe’ (Love will always conquer). Aschenborn married Helga-Christa Hermenau on 17 April 1947. They had a son and three daughters.

Very little is known about his early life. Baloyi moved to Alexandra north of Johannes- burg in 1922. His first job was that of a taxi driver but in 1925 he became a taxi owner. In 1927 he purchased his first buses and shortly afterwards he and other bus owners founded the Alexandra Bus Owners’ Association. The buses travelled regularly between Johannesburg and Alexandra and met the demand for cheap transport. However, this brought them into competition with bus companies controlled by whites. By 1940 the Alexandra Bus Owners’ Association was forced out of the market by a combination of legislation to entrench the position of South African Railways and competition from the better funded white-owned operations. Baloyi was often involved in disputes concerning bus fares to and from Alexandra Between 1939 and 1940 he apparently opposed the lowering of bus fares, though he claimed that he was fending for the inhabitants of Alexandra. When in August 1943 the bus fare was increased and the inhabitants of Alexandra started a general bus boycott, Baloyi was a member of the Emerg- ency Transport Committee who negotiated with the bus company for the lowering of the fare to the original. As community leader of Alexandra Baloyi also served on the local health committee. In the 1940s local white interests began to threaten the right to freehold in Sophiatown and Alexandra and by 1943 Baloyi was chairperson of the Alexandra Anti-Expropriation Committee— a committee trying to protect the interests of African entrepreneurs of Alexandra. On his letterhead Baloyi identified himself as the managing director of the Alexandra Land Industrial and Investment Company (an estate agency) and diffector of the Rustenburg Bus Service Pty Ltd. He was president of the Bantu Sports Club and a prominent member of the Bantu Methodist Church. Baloyi seems to have had a reputation as a controversial figure— as was the case with the bus fare dispute in 1939-1940. His controversial ity came to a 11 Copyrighted material head in 1945 when it became known that he was a member of a deputation to Cape Town to discuss the possible incorporation of Alexandra into Johannes- burg with members of parliament. This was deemed an act of treason by the Alexandra inhabitants and at a mass meeting in the township the following resolution was accepted: \"Mr R.G. Baloyi of this Township shall be no more a leader of any class of the African people of this Township until he dies.\" His political career started in about 1937 when he was elected to the Native Representative Council (NRC) and together with other NRC members contributed to reviving interest in the declining African National Congress (ANC). The councillors travelled widely and used their position to arouse interest in the ANC. Baloyi remained a councillor until 1942. In 1938 he was elected treasurer-general of the ANC. In the same year he was elected vice- president of the Non-European United Front which came into existence when the South African Communist Party (SACP), the National Liberation League, the ANC and other groups joined forces in an effort to establish a broad and powerful national movement co-ordinating all protest actions by blacks. The front, however, did not exist for very long— by 1942 the ANC withdrew its support, while coloured members preferred to establish their own organization. In May 1939 Baloyi was a member of the ANC deputation to Cape Town who met with the Minister of Native Affairs and the parliamentary representa- tives of the Africans. On this occasion Baloyi asked for one identification docu- ment— instead of several different passes as was the case then— and warned that the pass laws made criminals of the people. He also asked for the recognition of traditional chiefs. In 1943 he was a member of the Atlantic Charter Committee of the ANC which had to study and discuss problems arising out of the Atlantic Charter in so far as it related to Africa. (The charter had originally been drawn up by Great Britain and the United States of America in 1941 as a \"blueprint for future peace and security” and emphasized the maintenance of human rights.) The committee had to draw up a statement on the charter \"from the standpoint of the Africans within the Union of South Africa\" (called the African Claims), and draft a Bill of Rights. From 1944 Baloyi was one of the leaders of the anti- pass campaign. In 1948 Baloyi was one of the ANC delegates to negotiations with the All-African Convention (a national organization originally founded in the 1930s to protest the downgrading of the African franchise). The ANC hoped to achieve closer unity between the two organizations and to overcome rivalry. These talks failed. In January 1949 riots broke out between Africans and Indians in Durban. This led to a meeting between representatives of the ANC (with Baloyi one of the delegates), the South African Indian Congress and other African and Indian leaders in Durban on 6 February 1949. Baloyi’s position within the ANC became increasingly controversial. At the ANC annual conference in December 1947 his financial report as treasurer- general was rejected because it had not been audited. The following year he did not attend the conference and an acting treasurer was appointed. At that stage he was regarded with suspicion because of his support for a National Party candidate for Senate— his membership of the Transvaal branch of the ANC was in fact suspended for three years. He appealed against the suspension and at the Copy inhtpei r 12 annual conference in December 1949 it was lifted. In view of this and the fact that he had neglected his duties as treasurer, he was not re-elected as treasurer- general. However, he was elected to the national executive committee, but his former prominent political role was largely over. From 1952 he increasingly identified with the National Minded Bloc in the ANC — a conservative faction predominantly consisting of relatively wealthy businessmen which opposed the co-operation of the ANC with the SACP and the alleged communist influence on the ANC. Baloyi was married to Elizabeth Baloyi and though his death certificate indicates that he had no children, he named a son as executor, and probably also had three daughters.

Johannesburg, 1990. BARMANIA, Mahomed Dawood (^Pietermaritzburg, 21 April 1895— fCape Town, 10 February 1971), businessman, politician and community worker. He was the son of Dawood Barmania, owner of commercial and farming prop- erties in both Natal and Surat in the west Indian state of Gujarat— Gujarat being the region from which most of South Africa’s trader Indians orig- inated. At the turn of the century, after having been in Natal for some fifteen years, Dawood Barmania returned to India with his family. Barmania later attended City College, Calcutta and the University of Calcutta where an M.A. degree in Economics was conferred on him. Soon after graduating he returned to South Africa to assist his brother in the management of his father’s firm of general dealers at Umzimkulu in Southern Natal. In 1930 he moved to Cape Town where, after a brief spell as a general dealer, he followed a career as business manager and later as financial adviser. He retired in 1969. Largely as a consequence of his level of education— unusually high by the standards of the time for Indians in South Africa— Barmania was held in considerable esteem by Cape Town’s small Indian community. As community leader it was a natural step for him to enter politics by joining, in the mid- 1930s, the Cape Indian Congress. Soon afterwards he was elected to represent 13 Copyrighted material the Cape Province on the executive of the South African Indian Congress (SAIC). As a Muslim businessman Barmania was a representative of a class which had long dominated the politics of the Indian community in South Africa. This domination can be dated back to the arrival of the indentured Indians who were predominantly Hindu, and the arrival of the trader Indians who were predomi- nantly Muslim. The tensions generated by the long-simmering differences between the business class and the predominantly Hindu Indian proletariat were finally brought to a head between 1943 and 1946. The issue which precipitated the confrontation was the nature of the strategy to be pursued in response to the proposals of J.C. Smuts’s* government to establish segregated Indian residen- tial areas in Natal and the Transvaal. Instead of rejecting these proposals outright, as the new and populist generation of Indian political leaders in South Africa did, Barmania aligned himself with the SAIC’s traditional policy of attempting to find a compromise solution without conceding the principle of segregation. The introduction by the government of the Asiatic Land Tenure and Indian Representation Bill in March 1946 signalled the failure of the SAIC’s strategy and, in so doing, totally undermined the credibility of the Congress leadership. The new Bill resulted in a storm of protest, locally and abroad. The SAIC published a booklet summarizing its objections to the Bill. A representative was granted leave to be heard at the bar of the Senate of the South African Parliament against the provisions of the Bill. As one of the joint secretaries of the SAIC, Barmania addressed the Senate for 50 minutes on 3 May 1946 to explain why the Congress rejected the Bill. In light of the national and interna- tional protest against the Bill, it can be surmised that the Senate only agreed to Barmania’s appearance at the bar in an attempt to soften international condem- nation of the Bill. The significance of Barmania’s Senate appearance, the only one by an Indian South African, and one of only two such appearances— the first appearance was in 1914 in protest against the deportation of labour leaders— lies therefore in the realm of novelty rather than substance. Having lost control of the SAIC in October 1946, the conservative Indian leadership, of whom Barmania remained a member, formed a rival body, the South African Indian Organization. However, the futility of negotiations with the government, especially after the National Party came to power in 1948, led to Barmania’s early retirement from national politics. Barmania nevertheless continued to play an active community role by serving in charitable organizations, the local Mosque committee and the local school board. His services were not limited to the Indian community alone, for in Cape Town, Indians, particularly those who were Muslim, integrated easily with the Malay and coloured population. Upon his death the Cape Town City Council named a road in Crawford after him in recognition of his community work. While in India Barmania married Ayesha Bibi. A son and two daughters were born of the marriage. After his first wife’s death he married Jadija Sirkhotte in Cape Town in 1939. Three daughters and two sons were born of this marriage. 14 Copyrighted material Master of the Supreme Court, Cape Town: Estate no. 4901/71; — The South African Indian who's who and commercial directory, 1939.

BASSA, Cassim Mohammed (*India, 11 August 1925— tJohannesburg, 25 March 1983), estate agent and community leader, was the eighth of nine children of Mohammed Bassa, a businessman, and his wife Fathima. Bas- sa’s father came to South Africa with his family in 1927. Bassa was schooled in Durban and in 1944 matriculated through the prestigious Sastri College. Though his father encouraged him to train as a medical doctor, Bassa preferred to work as a research assistant in the Department of Economics at the University of Natal. Research on the econ- omic circumstances of Indians in Natal awakened Bassa's interest in the history of Indian immigrants in South Africa and their struggle against racial dis- crimination. He became involved in political activities and joined the Natal Indian Congress in 1948. Bassa’s involvement in community work came very much by accident. He was requested by the Natal Indian Blind Society to collect and replace collection boxes in public places like factories and shops. His appointment as honorary secretary of the society followed in 1953. As community leader Bassa decided to restrain his personal feelings as a strong proponent of the movements against racism, and rather work within the political system of the day for the benefit of the larger community. In doing so, Bassa was often subjected to humiliation for being black. He was either not allowed to attend welfare meetings or was given observer status with not only no vote but no voice either. He continued to make representations in person, if allowed, or conveyed his views to a white colleague who would then represent his case. Though Bassa was involved in voluntary welfare work with all disabled people, his greatest impact was among the visually and hearing impaired. As president of the Natal Indian Blind and Deaf Society from 1966 until his death, Bassa was responsible for the expansion of the workshop for the Indian blind, the introduction of professional social work services and other related services to blind and deaf persons in Natal. He constantly campaigned at every level for a better dispensation with regard to pensions and grants for blind and deaf persons and for better subsidies for the workshops. He was chairperson of the boards of management of the following state- subsidized schools: New Horizon School for the Blind, Durban School for the Indian Deaf and the V.N. Naik School for the Deaf. He served as an invited 15 Copyrighted material member on the Management Board of the Spes Nova School for Cerebral Palsied Children. When the Council for the Advancement of Special Education in South Africa was formed to represent all Indian special schools and training centres, Bassa was elected the first chairperson— a position he held until his death. Bassa was also involved in mainstream education and was grantee of the Orient Primary and Secondary Schools and the Anjuman Islam Primary School. Here again he was called upon to represent the Indian community in making representations for the improvement of community facilities. This he did successfully. At the time of his death he was also secretary of the Indian Centenary Scholarship Trust and joint secretary of the Orient Islamic Educa- tional Institute. At national level Bassa was a member of the executive committees of the South African National Council for the Blind and the South African National Council for the Deaf. These national bodies elected him chairperson for both the Division for Indian Blind and the Division for Indian Deaf. He served on several special committees in both the work of the blind and the deaf, as well as with the South African Welfare Council to which he was appointed by the Minister of Health and Welfare in terms of the National Welfare Act. He was a member of the Bureau for the Prevention of Blindness. Bassa attended three international assemblies as South African delegate: the World Council for the Welfare of the Blind in New Delhi, 1969, and in Sao Paulo in 1974, and the International Agency for the Prevention of Blindness in Oxford, 1978. He was a keen sportsman and played a leading role in promoting sport. He excelled in cricket and table tennis and led a table tennis team to play in Germany in 1957. Bassa was elected president of the South African Table Tennis Board which was affiliated to the international body. His condemnation of apartheid in sport and activities in the South African Council of Sport (SACOS) led to the government withdrawing his passport for many years. Bassa received several awards for his services: the J.N. Reddy Community Award in 1975; a citation from the Durban City Council in 1977; and the R.W. Bowen Medal with citation from the South African Council for the Blind in 1979. Apart from his volunteer work he was a successful estate agent. He was married to Khatija (nee Paruk). Three children were bom of this marriage— two daughters and a son. He died in his sleep in a hotel in Johannesburg where he was attending a meeting of the South African National Council for the Deaf. v.H. vaughan, Fifty years of service, 1929-1979: the story of the South African National Council for the Blind.

Berman’s parents came to Johannesburg when he was still a very young child. He matriculated from the Technical High School in Johannesburg in 1921. His father died while Berman was studying medicine at the University of the Witwatersrand, Johannes- burg, so he had to help his mother run the family business while continuing his medical studies. Nevertheless, his work on encephalitis lethargica (sleeping sickness) was the winning entry in the British Medical Association’s essay competition for fmal-year medical students of the British Empire outside the British Isles. He graduated M.B., Ch.B. in 1928. In 1930 Berman was appointed full-time locum tenens at the hospital for Africans at City Deep, a mine belonging to the Comer House Group. He stayed with this group until his death, working later at Rose Deep, Consoli- dated Main Reef and Durban Roodepoort Deep where he was the senior medical officer. His work span encompassed what has been described as the golden years of mine medicine, for the medical services were then so organized that medical officers could do a great deal of research in the course of their daily duties. The subject of his M.D. thesis (1938) was primary carcinoma of the liver, about which very little had been written at that time. Although a rare condition in whites, Berman found that it was common in the African labourers on the mines, particularly among those from Mozambique. He concluded that, al- though there was a genetic factor, the root cause was environmental, probably nutritional. His research ensured that the condition could be detected early, the key to the effective management of this disease. He published a monograph in 1951 and was soon recognized as a world expert on primary liver cancer. Many articles of his on this subject also appeared in a variety of journals. Berman attended many international congresses, and in 1959 spent nine months at the SIoan-Kettering Institute for Cancer Research at the Memorial Hospital in New York as a visiting associate professor in experimental surgery. His work led to the establishment in 1965 of the Primary Liver Research Pro- ject, based at City Deep and run in conjunction with the University of the Wit- watersrand. He was president of the Mine Medical Officers’ Association of South Africa in 1964-1965. A quiet and unassuming man, Berman was very artistic and musical. He was a member of the Johannesburg Musical Society for 35 years and enter- tained many internationally known musicians in his home. He. collected paint- ings, and was able to restore damaged canvases. He was a foundation member of the Oxford Synagogue in Johannesburg. Berman married Fay Roytowski of Cape Town and had two sons. 17 Copyrighted material Transvaal Archives, Pretoria: Estate no. 3607/67; — Obituaries: The Star, 28 April 1967; Jewish affairs, 22(5), May 1967; South African medical journal, 41(47), 23 December 1967; — a.p.

BIKO, Bantu Stephen (Steve) (*King William’s Town, 18 December 1946— fPretoria, 12 September 1977), Black Conscious- ness spokesperson, community worker and political activist, was the third child and second son of Mzin- gaye Matthew and Alice Duna (Mam)Cete Biko. (Some sources give his birthplace as Tarkastad and his mother's maiden name as Duma.) Biko came from a family of ordinary means: his father worked as a clerk and his mother did domestic work. His father died when Biko was four years old. There was no indication in his early childhood that he would assume a particular ideological stance. Biko attended the Brownlee Primary School for two years and the Charles Morgan Higher Primary School for four years. Both schools were in Ginsberg township near King Wil- liam’s Town. In 1963 he continued his education at Forbes Grant Secondary School in the township. During that year he went to Lovedale Institution at Alice in the Eastern Cape, where he was expelled after only three months, ostensibly because his brother, who was also at Lovedale, was arrested and imprisoned on charges of being a Poqo (the armed wing of the Pan-Africanist Congress) activist. In 1964, having missed a full year of studies after his dismissal from Lovedale, Biko went to boarding school at St Francis' College, a Roman Catholic institute at Mariannhill, Natal. He befriended a Catholic nun who discussed and explained at length all sorts of practices within the church. Biko also befriended a challenging Anglican priest, and pursued with interest questions of faith, his understanding of religion and his disappointment in the church. Thus, his secondary school training left him with a vested interest in Christianity (later reflected in thoughts on Black Theology) and an urge to strive towards an integrated, multiracial society. Matriculating at the end of 1965 Biko entered the medical school of the University of Natal (non-European section), Durban. He wanted to do law at university but there was a popular conception in the Eastern Cape that equated law with political activism, and that (under the circumstances Biko found himselD was to be discouraged. Medicine was the safe alternative for a good profession, and Biko won a scholarship to study it. Soon after entering the university Biko was elected to the Students’ Representative Council (SRC) of the medical school, and through it became involved with the multiracial Nation- al Union of South African Students (NUSAS). The members and leaders of 18 Copyrighted material NUSAS were largely drawn from the liberal English-speaking universities. Until 1968 black students saw NUSAS as their only vehicle to change. Disillusionment began to grow as this organization seemed to confine itself to symbolic multiracial activities and verbal protests against the government, describing apartheid as the enemy and nonracialism as the solution. Although black students did participate, white spokespersons defined and expressed black grievances and goals. During these years Biko progressively identified with the concept of Black Consciousness. He encouraged black students to dissociate themselves from white and multiracial student organizations. Apartheid had to be destroyed but the methods advanced by the liberal whites were at fault. The mere existence of multiracial organizations posed a contradiction and embodied, ironically, white racism. The pivot of black support hinged on the psychological battle for the minds of black people. Biko advocated solidarity among blacks; they had to identify with themselves and with blackness. This identification constituted a mental emancipation which in itself was a precondition for political emanci- pation. It is this concept of Black Consciousness (awareness) that could be regarded as Biko’s most prominent contribution. In 1968 Biko and his allies formed the South African Students’ Organization (SASO), based on Biko’s ideology of Black Consciousness, rejecting all white- conceived evolutionary solutions and renewing the trend away from liberal principles of reconciliation and nonviolence. The new organization and its ideological underpinnings struck a responsive cord in black university students. At SASO’s formal inaugural conference in July 1969 Biko became its first president and the next year he was appointed publicity secretary. Due to the movement’s pragmatic and nontheoretical undertone, it also had a following among the ordinary and the semi-literate blacks. This contributed largely to the formation of the Black People’s Convention (BPC) in 1972— an organization to which Biko was elected honorary life president in 1977. He terminated his studies at the university in 1972 and began to work for the Black Community Programmes (BCP) in Durban— initiated by the South African Council of Churches in 1971— whose offices were on the same premises as SASO. These programmes were geared particularly towards the social upliftment, general literacy and economic self-reliance of black people. The director of BCP (Bennie Khoapa) committed himself to the field of community development, but relied on Biko for political direction. The government’s reaction to Black Consciousness came in March 1973 when eight leaders were banned and restricted to different magisterial districts; Biko was banned and restricted to King William’s Town. Here he founded the Eastern Cape branch of the BCP and worked as branch executive until an extra clause was inserted in his banning order at the end of 1975 prohibiting him from working for the BCP. Biko was an untiring collector of funds and was instrumental in founding the Zimele Trust Fund in the Eastern Cape in 1975. The trust had three objectives. Firstly, it provided emotional and material support to ex-political prisoners at the time of their release. Secondly, educational support in the form of bursaries was provided for their dependants. Thirdly, the economic restabilization of ex-political prisoners was encouraged by supporting the establishment of home industries and the Ginsberg Educa- tional Trust for black students. He made a high profile appearance in May 1976 when giving evidence at a trial of nine SASO-BPC members in Pretoria. During cross-examination Biko and his co-accused used the trial as a platform for expressing their political views and for speaking to their followers. He used history as his point of reference, and thereby highlighted the force and passion of Black Conscious- ness. Biko went further than using the dock as public platform: he challenged the very judicial process, and although he apparently did not expect the court to judge in his favour, he was satisfied that he was able to give an authoritative description of Black Consciousness. Following the Soweto riots in June 1976 and at a time of general mass demonstrations against apartheid and the government, Biko was arrested in August 1976 and detained for 101 days under section 6 of the Terrorism Act, 1967. In March and July 1977 he was again arrested; in March he was detained and then released and in July released on bail. On 19 August 1977, driving back to the Eastern Cape from Cape Town, together with Peter C. Jones (an activist in the Western Cape region of BPC in 1975-1976, who was requested by Biko to come and manage the King William’s Town office), he was stopped at a police roadblock near Grahams- town, outside his restricted area, and arrested. He was taken to Port Elizabeth and detained for questioning— during which he was seriously injured. On 11 September he was taken to Pretoria for medical attention, but he died on 12 September 1977. The cause of death was a brain haemorrhage. During the subsequent inquest into the cause of Biko’s death which started in November 1977 details of the maltreatment of political prisoners were revealed. However, as the exact events could not be reconstructed the police were exonerated. Steve Biko was buried on 25 September 1977 beside the railroad near King William’s Town. Thousands of mourners from all over the country, including diplomats from thirteen Western countries, converged on the town for the funeral. Police action prevented many mourners from the Transvaal, Durban, Cape Town and other areas from reaching the funeral. Biko was described as a person of charm and personality. He was an orator of the highest quality whose perception and energy freed people psychological- ly to take their destiny into their own hands. At the same time he was described as sensitive and agonizing over many matters. Biko generally discouraged the cult of personality and tried to play a back-room role. Accord- ing to him the struggle for black liberation was to be led by many rather than a few. Biko's life is fairly well documented. Some of his speeches and thoughts were published; books, films (documentary and otherwise), stage plays and artifacts about him were made available; and annually the Biko Remembrance Day evokes a fairly widespread fervour. His name has been linked to such diverse causes as those of Black Consciousness and the Azanian Peoples' Organization (AZAPO) to the Pan- Africanist Congress and the African Nation- al Congress. The truth is that Biko's style and thoughts were such that no one organization could possibly contain them. In aid of the Black Renaissance Convention, SASO, BPC and BCP, Biko 20 Copyrighted material published pamphlets and memoranda. He also contributed articles to Katatonia (mouthpiece of the Medical Students’ Council of the University of Natal, Durban) between 1968 and 1971, and The Daily Dispatch (under the pseudo- nym Tenjiwe Ntintso). In December 1970 he married Nontsikelelo (Ntsiki) Margaret Mashalaba from Umtata. They had two sons. He also had a relationship with Mamphela Ramphele, a fellow student and member of SASO, who became a follower of Black Consciousness and was the first medical officer at the Zanempilo Community Health Centre which was opened in King William’s Town in April 1975. To a great extent Ramphele served as a sounding-board for his political ideas. Two children were born of the relationship: a daughter who died at two months, and a son born after Biko’s death in 1978. South African Police, [Pretoria]: Reports on S.B.

BLACKBURN, Molly (*Port Elizabeth, 12 November 1930— fHumansdorp, 28 December 1985), political activist and civil rights campaigner, was the daughter of Elgar Bellhouse (Buller) and Gladys Kathleen Pagden. From an early age she was exposed to liberal politics through her father, a former chairperson of the Progressive Party in Port Elizabeth. She was educated at Collegiate School for Girls in Port Elizabeth and at Rhodes University, Grahamstown, where she graduated with a B.A. degree. On a skiing trip in Europe she met Geoffrey Fletcher, whose Antwerp-based family specialized in maritime law. They married in 1954 but she found the role of a continental housewife an unsettling experience and in 1963 she and her three children returned to Port Elizabeth, 21 Copyrighted material where she worked as a laboratory assistant. In April 1967 she married Gavin Blackburn, a medical doctor. They had four children. To see her eldest three children through university, Blackburn started working as an estate agent and eventually went into partnership with two other women. She withdrew from the partnership in 1981 after her entrance into public life. In that year she won the Provincial Council seat of Walmer, Port Elizabeth, for the Progressive Federal Party (PFP). In spite of her reservations about the council, which she felt dealt too exclu- sively with issues affecting the white community, she proved an extremely hard-working member with a highly conscientious devotion to duty. To her critics she defended her involvement with the government body on the grounds that it was not a creation of the new constitutional dispensation, which was being planned by the government, and hinted at her possible resignation from the PFP. Molly Blackburn’s exposure to the problems of South African life came through her involvement with the Black Sash Advice Office when it reopened in Port Elizabeth in 1982. Having resigned from the Black Sash in the mid- 1960s because of its apparent inactivity, she now rejoined the movement. Through the advice office she came face-to-face with the grim reality of the region: the poverty, violence, political impotence and anger of the black communities. As her reputation as a person who listened to problems grew, Blackburn was approached by numerous black groups to represent their interests— as was the case with the residents of the Lingelihle township near Cradock when Matthew Goniwe requested her in September 1983 to enquire officially into the structuring of rent, and to advise them on the procedures for forming a civic association. There were few whites in public life who were as trusted and respected in the black community as Blackburn. ‘Mama Molly’, as she was known, was a familiar sight at political rallies and funerals. It was Blackburn, together with Di Bishop, a colleague in the Cape Provincial Council and a member of the Black Sash, who first drew the attention of the council to the critical situation in areas such as Cradock where, in their judgment, the black community had been alienated by the insensitive actions of officialdom. As early as 1983 Blackburn warned that the status of the police as law-enforcement officers was being undermined in these troubled communities. In an article in The Cape Times in May 1984 she warned that whites visiting black townships were no longer greeted by friendly waves, but by skinny arms raised in a clenched-fist salute. Thanks largely to the efforts of Molly Blackburn and Di Bishop, supported by a number of PFP members of parliament, an initially reluctant National Party government agreed to the establishment of a commission of inquiry into the incident of police shootings at Langa township near Uitenhage on 21 March 1985 (the Commission Appointed to Inquire into the Incident which Occurred on 21 March 1985 at Uitenhage, chairperson D.D.V. Kannemeyer). The Kannemeyer Commission report, arguably the most important inquiry since the investigation into the 1976 Soweto disturbances, was a tribute to Blackburn’s 22 Copyrighted material determined campaign to establish the truth surrounding that tragic episode. The authorities in the Eastern Cape and the Cape Provincial Council, dominated by the National Party, rapidly came to regard Blackburn as a trouble maker. Her insistent questioning and criticism of police and development board action aroused their wrath. Even some of her political colleagues, schooled in traditional liberal opposition politics, resented her confrontationist approach. Her work was also not without risk. On a number of occasions she faced criminal charges as a result of her activities, as in July 1985 when she was arrested for attending a commemorative service for black leaders in Zwide, Port Elizabeth. Anonymous death threats, intimidation and harassment were a constant burden to bear. On 28 December 1985 Molly Blackburn, her sister, Judy Chalmers, Di Bishop and her husband Brian who was a leader in the Civil Rights League, were driving back to Port Elizabeth after a day spent in Bongolethu township, Oudtshoom. On a straight section of the road near Humansdorp the car, driven by Brian Bishop, was involved in a collision with another vehicle. Blackburn, Bishop and the driver of the other car were killed. Blackburn’s death stunned and saddened many South Africans from all race groups who shared her commitment to interracial justice and admired her courage in forging links across the colour bar. Her funeral was attended by an estimated 20 000 people, an indication of her remarkable relationship with the black communities with whom she worked so tirelessly. Dr G.

BODASING, Babu (*Gosheekigurh, Agra district of Northern India, c. 1853— fDurban, 15 November 1919), also known as Dulel Sing Boodhasing, colonial number 8726, was a prominent sugar cane farmer and landowner on the Natal north coast. The family belonged to the Raj- put or military caste. Bodasing arrived in Natal on the immigrant ship Enmore 1 which sailed from Calcutta on 1 August 1874 and arrived at Port Natal on 1 September 1874. He was the second son in a poor family of seven children and he became an indentured immi- grant for purely economic reasons. He gave the name of his mother, Kissonee Boodhasing, as his nearest relative. Nothing is known about his per- sonal appearance except that, like most of his generation of Indian indentured immigrants, he was short— his height is recorded as 5 foot 2 inches (about 157,48 cm). How much schooling he had is not known, although he was literate and obviously had come from an agricultural background and under- stood both the value of land and how best to utilize it. 23 Copyrighted material Immediately after his arrival he was indentured to the New Guelderiand estate at Groutville on the north coast. The estate, one of the largest in Natal, had been established by T.C. Colenbrander* but he was declared bankrupt in 1 870; in 1 874 when Bodasing arrived it was in the hands of the Glasgow and Natal Sugar Company. However, by 1880 the estate was insolvent again and in 1882 it was taken over by a Matthews, Ash and Stewart. This estate was exceptionally well equipped with milling equipment and machinery necessary to refine sugar for export. Bodasing was allocated to the sugar milling section and spent the entire period of his indenture there, first as a labourer and then, as his leadership qualities were recognized, as a sirdar (a title indicating rank or leadership). He thus had the opportunity to learn all aspects of the sugar industry. Throughout his time as an indentured worker he saved every penny he could from his wages. In addition he kept back some of his rations each week and sold them to his fellow workers who had families to feed. With the money he accumulated he hired a piece of land adjoining the estate and, working in his spare time, planted it with mealies, ground nuts, tobacco and vegetables, selling the harvest to supplement the rations provided to indentured labourers. As a result of this industry and initiative he found himself in the position to buy land in the Nonoti district (in the vicinity of the Nonoti River to the north of Stanger) as soon as his contract expired. (The contract was for a five-year period. Thereafter the worker was given an option of serving another five years for a free passage back to India, or obtaining his freedom. It is assumed Bodasing did not renew his contract, but chose the last option.) From the outset he planted sugar cane. To raise the capital he entered into an equal partnership agreement with a Hollander named Frikson. Bodasing ploughed back all profits into the farm, buying more land as the opportunity arose. His next venture was in the vicinity of Dotana Beach near Stanger where he again planted sugar cane. Next he acquired land in the Groutville area not far from New Guelderiand. In bad times he was able to survive because he never overextended his resources and in good times he used his profits thriftily. By 1900 he owned several thousand acres under cane, and three acres at Tugela, used for stock farming. By this time he was undoubtedly the largest Indian landowner in Natal and the first independent Indian sugar farmer. He dreamed of opening his own sugar mill but died before he could do so. With his farming activities established, he began to buy property in Durban and in towns along the north coast, opening trading stores on several of the sites although his main investment was in residential property. He eventually built a large house on his New Guelderiand property which he named Delhi. Bodasing was aware of the value of education and began to interest himself in schools for Indian children and for his workers. The first school was opened for workers on his New Guelderiand farm. His sons continued his educational work after his death and in 1929 the school was moved to the original Bodasing farm house and named the New Guelderiand Government Aided Indian school. Bodasing was also ahead of his time in providing housing for his workers and taking an interest in their welfare. Bodasing was a staunch Hindu, interested in cultural activities relating to his 24 people, and a firm believer in Gandhi’s philosophy of nonviolence. Bodasing apparently married a young Indian girl named Lukkia on board ship on the voyage from Calcutta. Her father was recorded as Subnath (colonial number 7490). Lukkia’s parents were of the Chhattri or warrior/land-owning caste of Northern India and as Chhattri is given as synonym for Rajput the bride was of a caste similar to Bodasing’s— an important fact in the India of the time. Nine children— five sons and four daughters— were bom of the marriage. Bodasing and his wife died in the same year, she in June and he in November. A note in the death register states that he was probably the wealthiest Indian- born man in Durban, with extensive property holdings in Stanger.

BOXALL, Dorothy Ruth (*King William’s Town, 19 July 1 895— tJohannes- burg, 23 December 1951), music teacher and lec- turer, writer and organizer of orchestral activities for the youth, was a daughter of William Percival and Augusta Boxall. Boxall matriculated at Jeppe High School, Johan- nesburg, and won a scholarship to study music. From school she proceeded to the Johannesburg Training College to train as a teacher. After com- pleting the Diploma in Music as well as the UTLM, LTCL and FTCL diplomas, she enrolled for the B.Mus. degree at the University of the Witwaters- rand, Johannesburg. She studied under Prof. P.R. Kirby* who had started the Department of Music at the university in 1921 , and obtained the degree with distinction— thus becoming the first South African to obtain this degree at the University of the Witwaters- rand. In 1926 Boxall joined the staff of Robert Pritchard’s studio as lecturer in music history, and then taught at Maude Harrison's conservatoire until 1930 when she opened her own studio with Clarice Greenstone. In addition she taught at various schools on the Reef, including the girls’ high schools of Parktown and Jeppe, while she was also organizer of music at the Rosettenville Junior Government School. In 1934 she was appointed lecturer in music at the Johannesburg Normal College, a position she retained for seventeen years. Boxall twice won gold medals for solo piano playing and frequently gave recitals for the Johannesburg Musical Society. Boxall believed that music was essential in every child's education. 25 Copyrighted material Maintaining that \"everyone can sing\" she encouraged children’s active participation in music through singing or performing on musical instruments. In working among children from all sections of the community she dedicated her life to promoting and encouraging talent among the less privileged. In her spare time she scored music for percussion bands. In 1932 she announced Saturday afternoon classes for children in percussion instruments and musical appreciation. However, it was not until 1945 that she realized her ambition to form a children’s orchestra. Recruited from her percussion bands the little orchestra rehearsed every Saturday morning in the Johannesburg Teacher’s Training College and in April 1946 the Young Citizen’s Orchestra gave its first concert. Early members of this orchestra included Alex Murray who became a member of one of London’s leading orchestras, Derek Ochse, senior lecturer at the University of the Orange Free State, and Peggy Haddon, senior lecturer at the University of the Witwatersrand. Her love of choral work and her ambition to include less privileged children materialized in October of the same year when she directed a choir of 1 000 children, accompanied by the children’s orchestra. In 1947 a mass choir sang under her direction at the Zoo Lake during the British royal family’s visit. Boxall was presented with a gold medal by Their Majesties for her educational work in music. By 1950 the Children’s Festival had become an annual event including not only the mass choir and the Young Citizen’s Orchestra, but also a percussion band, a recorder band and the percussion band of St Vincent’s School for the Deaf. Devoting all her spare time to outside activities connected with music, she served on the executive council of the Johannesburg Music Society; acted as adjudicator at both the then European and Coloured Eisteddfods; was a member of the Music Committee of the Teachers’ School Music Association; served on the Research and Education Committee of the South African Society of Music Teachers; and was twice chairwoman of the Witwatersrand University Musical Society. A regular contributor on music to Die boervrou, she also-had articles published in the South African music teacher , the Transvaal educational news, The Sunday Times and The Star. Her ultimate aim was to embrace all the arts in her movement. Accordingly in 1949 the Johannesburg Junior Orchestra and Theatre was launched. A year later, in 1950, this was followed by the first Annual Play Festival for schools and colleges. In co-operation with a Mr Woodhouse, organist of the St Mary’s Cathedral and later of the Mayfair Anglican Church, Boxall organized the first South African Carols by Candlelight at the Zoo Lake. In 1951, the year of her death, she established the Witwatersrand College of Music whose new approach to music teaching ensured that children learnt to play instruments for which they were psychologically suited. In her will Boxall left a trust for the Dorothy Boxall Bursary for Music to be awarded annually to a child in the Johannesburg municipality for teaching and training in music. Unfortunately this bursary was only awarded two or three times; since about 1960 no award has been made. The year after her death the Children’s Music Festival Society, the Transvaal School Music Association and the Johannesburg Junior Orchestra and 26 Theatre merged to become the Dorothy Boxall Young People’s Music and Drama Movement. This group held a memorial concert for her in September 1952. Transvaal Archives, Pretoria: Estate no. 184/52; — W.H.K., The arts in South Africa.

BROCK, John Fleming (Jack) (*Port Elizabeth, 27 March 1905— tCape Town, 3 July 1983), scientist, physician and teacher, was educated at Grey School, Port Eliza- beth, and at the University of Cape Town (UCT). In 1925 he proceeded to Oxford University, England, as a Rhodes Scholar. After qualifying as physician in 1931, Brock served at the London Hospital, Eng- land as intern, registrar and research assistant. While he was Leverhulme Research Fellow of the Royal College of Physicians of London from 1932 to 1934, he spent a year at the Thorndike Memorial Laboratory, Boston City Hospital, United States of America (USA), studying the relationship of iron deficiency to hypochromic anaemia. In 1934 he was appointed first medical assistant at the then Postgraduate Medical School and Hammersmith Hospital, London. After the D.M. degree of Oxford was conferred on him in 1935 he left for Cambridge as assistant director of research in medicine. In 1938, the year in which he became Fellow of the Royal College of Physicians (London), Brock was appointed professor of the practice of medicine at UCT and joint head of the Department of Medicine, Groote Schuur Hospital, a post in which he remained until 1953 when he became professor of medicine and head of the department. Brock excelled at research and administration. He first became involved in clinical nutrition in 1932, and his fundamental contributions regarding protein energy malnutrition and the relationship between diet and atherosclerosis were recognized throughout the world. He was a member of the South African Nutrition Council and its research committee, and a member of the National Advisory Committee on Nutrition and Research to the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research (CSIR). In 1949 he became director of the CSIR/UCT Clinical Nutrition Research Unit, as well as a member of the nutrition panel of the World Health Organization (WHO). He was appointed as a WHO consul- tant in 1950, and his monograph with M. Autret entitled Kwashiorkor in Africa was published as a WHO special report in 1952. In 1959 he presented the Humphrey Davy Rolleston lectures to the Royal College of Physicians in London, and read a paper at the Tenth Anniversary Symposium of the Ciba Foundation, entitled Significant trends in medical research. In 1960 he was invited to contribute to the international symposium on Humanity and subsis- 27 Copyrighted material tence organized by Nestis and chaired a panel on protein and amino acids at the Fifth International Nutrition Congress in Washington. In 1961 he was awarded the Silver Medal of the Medical Association of South Africa for distinguished research. A textbook entitled Recent advances in human nutrition which he edited was published in 1961. In 1962 he became chairperson of the WHO Expert Committee on the Medical Assessment of Nutritional Status. In 1963 he was invited to the Ciba Foundation Symposium on the biological future of man and the Sixth International Nutrition Congress in Edinburgh, Scotland, and was guest of honour at the Ciba Foundation Study Group on Diet and Bodily Constitution. In 1964 he attended, by invitation, the hundreth anniversary of the Boston City Hospital and the fortieth anniversary of the Thorndike Memorial Laboratory. In 1966 he was guest lecturer of the American College of Physicians, which elected him an honorary Fellow. In 1967 he was visiting professor at the Department of Nutrition Sciences, at Berkeley University, California, USA. From 1959 to 1970 he was a Fellow of UCT. The development of the Department of Medicine at UCT reveals ample evidence of Brock’s skill as an administrator. On assuming the chair of medicine, he found himself in charge of an embryonic unit, which although its teaching and patient care were solid, was lacking in research and could not fully qualify as an academic department. Thirty-two years later he left a department which had established itself as a centre of excellence, not only for patient care and for teaching, but also recognized throughout the world for the high standard of its clinical and fundamental research. In 1938 the department was housed in a comer of what is now the third-year block, but by 1970 it occupied four floors of the Falmouth Building for which he himself had raised the funds. The number of staff members had increased markedly as had the number of publications. In 1938 there were less than five publications, while in 1970 there were 155. Brock served on the council of t"
