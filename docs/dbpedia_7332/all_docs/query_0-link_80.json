        "text": "The research which gave rise to this Report was carried out by a team of researchers drawn from the HSRC’s Democracy, Governance and Service Delivery (DGSD) Programme and external history and heritage experts. The objective of the research was twofold: (1) to identify new heritage sites that can be included in the National Liberation Heritage Route to be submitted to UNESCO for consideration as a World Heritage Site; and (2) to identity and record the history of unsung heroes and heroines of the struggle. The focus of the research was on five provinces: the Western Cape, Eastern Cape, KwaZulu-Natal, Limpopo and North-West provinces. The starting point of the research was the history of the struggle for liberation. The research methodology included the review of relevant secondary literature and archival material, as well as interviews with a selection of academics, heritage practitioners and veterans of the liberation struggle. This was complemented by a series of workshops in all five provinces as well as the presentation of results of the research at seminars to generate discussion. The research aimed at identifying heritage sites based on the history of the liberation struggle in each of the provinces under study. Key historical events and the significant activities of communities, organisations and individuals are highlighted to draw attention to key moments in the country’s liberation history that deserve memorialisation in the manner envisaged in the National LHR. In line with the requirements of the National Heritage Council, the history of the liberation struggle is divided into three phases. In the first phase (the second section), the focus is on the Khoikhoi wars of resistance in the 17th and 18th centuries, the slave revolts in the early 19th century, and organised political resistance in the late 19th and early 20th centuries in the current Western Cape Province; San and Khoikhoi resistance in the period 1702-1809, the Wars of Dispossession or the Hundred Years War (1779-1880), and the period thereafter until 1910 in which the dispossessed Africans used journalism, petitions and their political weight as voters in the Cape Parliament to put forward the case of the oppressed in the Eastern Cape; the Battles of Ncome, Isandlwana, Rorke’s Drift and Ulundi, the Langalibalele revolt and the Bambhata rebellion in KwaZulu-Natal; the 19th century anti-colonial resistance of the Tswana people in the region which makes up the current North West Province, and the various wars of resistance of the Bapedi, Venda, Ndebele, and Tsonga during the 19th century in the Limpopo Province. Potential heritage sites are identified in each area of the historical analysis. In the second phase (the third section), the focus is on the formation of the Union of South Africa in 1910, the 1913 Land Act and resistance to these developments; the formation of key organisations, e.g. the South African Native National Congress (SANNC – later the ANC), the Communist Party of South Africa (CPSA), the Industrial and Commercial Workers’ Union of South Africa (ICU), the All-African Convention (AAC), the Non-European Unity Movement (NEUM), the ANC Youth League (ANCYL), and the Pan Africanist Congress (PAC); the key campaigns of the period, e.g. the campaign against the Hertzog Bills, the Indian Passive Resistance Campaign, the Anti-Coloured Affairs Department Campaign, the Defiance Campaign, the campaign against Bantu Education, and the Freedom Charter campaign; and significant massacres/acts of resistance, e.g. the Bulhoek Massacre, Sekhukhuneland Revolt, and the anti-pass revolt in Zeerust. The final chapter in this section contains a list of potential heritage sites. The third phase (the final section) is characterised by a number of significant events and processes within the liberation struggle that took place and/or affected the country as a whole, as well as the steady escalation of the liberation struggle until it reached its conclusion with the first democratic elections in 1994. This phase is further divided into four parts: the 1960s, the 1970s, the 1980s and 1990-1994."
