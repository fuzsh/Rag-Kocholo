        "text": "Cape Town - Sharks centre Piet Lindeque is heading back to the Cheetahs to continue his rugby career in Bloemfontein.\n\nThe 22-year-old, who played outside centre for the Sharks against the Bulls in Durban last weekend, will join the Cheetahs in time for this year's Currie Cup, reports the Volksblad website.\n\nLindeque was a star in Free State rugby in his junior days, representing Grey College and Free State schools as a centre. He was then snapped up by the Sharks where his career struggled to take off.\n\nHowever, his career was reignited this year when Sharks allowed him to play for Tuks in the Varsity Cup. His solid form subsequently prompted a Super Rugby call-up for the Sharks.\n\nWith the Cheetahs experiencing their best Super-season to date, Lindeque feels he will fit right into their exciting playing style.\n\n\"Piet is ecstatic to return to the Free State,\" said his agent, Jan-Harm van Wyk.\n\n\"It's a positive move for his career and I know he enjoys the Cheetahs' playing style... he believes it will enhance his game.\""
