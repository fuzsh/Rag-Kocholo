        "text": "MENTAL HEALTH WORKSHOP\n\nDATE: 20-11-1997\n\n_________________________________________________________\n\nDR ORR: ... to look at the whole health sector process. But I think in addition, we are hoping that out of this workshop will come issues to do with reparation and rehabilitation and I think Hlengiwe is going to speak to that issue.\n\nMRS MKHIZE: Thank you colleagues. I will also like to add a word of welcome. This part of the process is very, very important for us because it gives us an opportunity to make sure that in our recommendations, we do not compromise mental health related recommendations.\n\nI know some people have been concerned that this won't get the publicity that the health submissions got. I should think really we must understand that what is important is not so much the media drama, if we work and we carefully examine issues and in our report, mental health related issues are not compromised, I should think we would have achieved our goal.\n\nSo, the numbers are not very good, but I hope we will be creative and make sure that we cover the areas which have been identified in the letter of invitation very, very carefully and achieve what we have set ourselves up to achieve.\n\nAnd the first question which most people have been asking is, why a workshop in mental health following the health hearings? I should think Wendy has in a way tried to link the two. To add to what she has said - as a Commission we are really in search for a name for an institution which will address the needs of people who have appeared before the Commission with overwhelming emotional scars.\n\nOur mental health institutions have over the years been accused of committing gross human rights' violations and I looked at the submissions, those concerns that had been raised time and again, even in June when we had the health submissions, there was a theme whereby people constantly raised concerns about mental health institutions.\n\nExperts within our profession have also been accused of being instrumental in devising torture methods. That again, hasn't been given the attention it deserves.\n\nThe mental health directorate has been left without a Director for more than a year in the history of our country, so all those things are just raising cause for concern as to who is going to address the issues which have emerged in this process.\n\nIn terms of the mental health directorate, in terms of its location, it remains a cinderella within the Department of Health and mental health related concerns flowed backward and forward between health and welfare. In one of the submissions here, I don't know if you've all got the submissions that I am referring to, there is a call for instance which has been made by a well-known psychologist Professor Victor Nel whom we had thought he would be here, who is making a call for a creation of a human service department or ministry.\n\nThis is a bold call for the creation of help and guidance centres under the human service department or ministry.\n\nIn his words, he is saying medical gate keeping to human services, will be replaced by a system better able to avoid physical treatment of psychological distress. Individuals will often be self-referred, deciding themselves whether to present at a health clinic or at a health and guidance centre.\n\nCost offset benefits will accrue through the avoidance of expensive medical treatment and the reduction of client loads at clinics. At the same time, a broad base will be established for the development of the full range of human services within which known governmental organisations could be accommodated.\n\nI would like to add three things to Prof Nel's proposal that what he is saying, it offers a concrete step to a promised move from institutionalised care to community mental health care. Secondly it opens a window opportunity for other people like business, the churches and so on, and angels of course as he referred to them, to be part of a solution in healing the wounds of the apartheid experience.\n\nThirdly, SAISA has already made a call for the independence of SYCO of the control of psychology from the Medical and Dental Council, so SAISA and Prof Nel's position, can merge well if carefully examined.\n\nAnd they can lead to concrete results of strengthening community base care or promotion of well-being rather than adherence to occur. Here is Sats Cooper, just when I have finished to talk to what SAISA had said. I am sure if he had indicated that he will be part of us, he will articulate that better and there will be an opportunity for him to articulate that this morning. It is very, very important for us to be clear about what we are saying.\n\nThe question is how will the TRC process be carried forward. Really healing the memories of the past and developing the culture of human rights' is a major challenge, especially for our profession.\n\nProfessionals with psychological skills have an important role to play, especially to facilitate processes which will address generational, emotional dilemmas.\n\nAs I have said, there is a big question whether mental health care as it stands today, will be in an opportunity to assist in this task or we need to carefully examine Prof Nel's proposal as well as SAISA's proposal, because if we do not do that, the opportunity will be lost in terms of creating a new establishment which will make sure that our skills are not compromised under established professions, or professions which have dominated this field over the years.\n\nSo we are hoping that as we are guided by experts who will be talking to different areas, we will spend some time in workshops and get clarity as to where, what we want to recommend in our report at the end, thank you.\n\nCHAIRPERSON: Thank you. The next section, if you remember the invitations we spread up the topics according to the focuses as you can see on the programme. We actually didn't get any submissions regarding Legislative Regulations which was a shame. We had one person who could have come, but they had to come up from Cape Town, and we didn't have enough flight tickets for that.\n\nIt is very short notice, but I wonder whether we could maybe open it up, the discussion, we've got half an hour to not in terms of a submission, but maybe Sats Cooper, you've just arrived, I don't know whether you are how on foot, but I wonder whether we could actually open up the discussion in terms of Legislative Regulations of Mental Health, because we actually haven't got a spokesman for that particular section. What do you people think?\n\nMr Cooper, do you think you could - could you please come forward?\n\nMR COOPER: As you are aware, the current dispensation is one (indistinct) with transition, because the legislation is being revised.\n\nWe have a Health Profession's Act that is currently under consideration by the National Council of Provinces and it is almost a foregone conclusion that that will be adopted during this session, however, there is going to be probably an amendment to that legislation in February session, because it has been raced through by the State Attorneys and there are grave problems with that legislation as it currently stands, so I would imagine that the Commission and the Health Sectors generally, but more specifically the Mental Health Sector can give some serious consideration to impacting on how that amended legislation can be in February.\n\nThat is one. The second is that the Mental Health Act is currently being considered for revision. However, and I don't want this to be looked at as a judgement of the people responsible for the process, this legislation is likely to end up becoming just like the Health Profession's Act which is really the Medical and Dental Council's Amendment Act, it is going to be a patchwork quilt to make the current legislation a little more acceptable in terms of the new dispensation.\n\nHowever, it is unlikely to meet the serious challenges posed by Mental Health generally attributable to living in an apartheid society, which is one of the serious problems that the Mental Health sector has not even come to terms with - the serious stress of living under an apartheid society.\n\nAs we know, at least one in two persons going to Doctors' surgeries or receiving or requesting medical help, have a psychological rather than a somatic base to their illness. This is true the world over. In South Africa the research shows this but the research is dated to the 70's.\n\nAnd given the massive social transformation that has taken place in the interceding years since that research was conducted by the HSRC, we can safely say that not less than one in two persons going for help treatment, suffers from a psychological base rather than an organic or somatic base to their illness. That poses severe consequences for the whole system of Mental Health delivery, but Health delivery as well because there has been a bias to somatic health rather than look at the psychosomatic and other tenant consequences of living in a highly stresses, highly divided and highly racist environment.\n\nWhat it does to both black and white, what it does to people who have been living under this (indistinct) over a long period of time. In making these submissions, it is noteworthy that the submissions are being made and I am saying this with a smile in my face, that is why I pitched here a little late, being made also on behalf of the professional board for psychology. It is noteworthy that when submissions are made by various sectors, it tends to be the darkies who come and front for the people who have been responsible for these conditions.\n\nIn the business sector, for Cyril Ramaphosa to be one of the leaders in presentation, is a supreme irony. For the Mental Health sector, for Sats Cooper to present this, is also another irony, but this has been a late motive that I am sure the Commissioners have taken note of.\n\nThere seems to be a clear cowardice by white benefactors of the past system, to actually confront their benefit during this era under consideration.\n\nI would imagine that there are very few now, within the Health Sector and indeed specifically in the Mental Health Sector, who would acknowledge participation whether overt or covert for the gross and lesser human violations that have taken place during their period of untrembled control of our society.\n\nHaving said that, I think it is important also to recognise that there are many people who having benefitted from that past, and who have been trust into serious positions of prominence within particular sectors and particular fields in health, are now apparently prepared to make some concession to creating a climate for reconciliation.\n\nThere is no way to test their subjective commitment to this process, but we have to only go on their objective statements to that effect. I have had certain comments from colleagues about the quaint and particular involvements that they have had and how they have been subject to scrutiny by the previous security apparatus and so on and so on and so on.\n\nBut nevertheless, all that type of witness really amounts to trivialising I think this whole Truth and Reconciliation process. A position which has not been fully canvassed, certainly not at all with the professional board, but within the psychological fraternity and within SAISA specifically, is one for specific reparations for specific care giving for rehabilitation purposes for those who had been affected directly by gross human violations and a suggestion I would like to put forward, is to consider a particular list of people who could be enabled to get assistance should they have been victims of gross human violations during this period under review, and should they have come forward to so testify and so claim that they have been affected by gross human violations, I would imagine that one needs to look at the kinship relationships. One needs to look at at least the first degree remove in terms of the victim.\n\nBy that I mean if it is myself, you should look at my parents, if they are alive or step parents or other extended network, because one of the problems with our legislation is it is a narrow (indistinct) christian western one, that excludes the extended family network and the result is a vast number or our people, get penalised.\n\nFor instance in the welfare system, legitimacy begins to be, was the norm rather. So what I am saying is we must look at the parentage, so it could be a grandmother who is that parent and then below, the children and offspring and other dependants, or people relying on me, that at least those three generations, my generation as an affected individual, the people above me and the people below me, need to get treatment, because it does have very severe effects.\n\nFrom my own particular experience with having been a victim of the repressive system in the past, I know that there are very close family and friends, comrades, who even 20 odd years after a detention, and that detention may have been for a very short period of time, and may have involved some verbal abuse and a few slaps, are affected by what has happened to them, because there has been no resolution of that.\n\nI think all the trauma other torture rehabilitation work that have been done from the, during the period of the 1980's to now, have really touched the surface only of the problem. So, this method may actually create a window of opportunity for those people who have testified before this Commission, and I would imagine you need to give a period when those people who have not testified because of the cut off date, being in December because people may not have been informed, or many people like I know colleagues who have just said, what is the point. It has happened, I have been a participant in creating this new society, but why should I come there and cry?\n\nWhy should I come there and seek some restitution. We should give them a window of opportunity over a few months to actually come and seek treatment. There is nothing that can be done to impose on them to seek assistance, but that assistance should be given. An additional point is one that I think the Reparations Commission has been battling with in terms of assisting people to get on their feet.\n\nA point would be to look at the legislation in some other societies like in India where you have the so-called untouchables, who have been given a particular status in the society. There is a particular affirmative action status, that they enjoy. Indeed a court system applies in many states in India for those Hurijans or formerly untouchable groups of people. My suggestion would be that victims again to those two generations removed on either side, should have a certain preference in the State sector for employment, because that is our tax money.\n\nIt is not asking private businesses to employ them, it is not saying to Sanlam who has come here and talked about we couldn't do anything about Steve Biko's death in our building, nevertheless Sanlam is known to have employed a lot of ex-Security policemen and so on. It is not asking them, it is saying to this government that controls our tax money, use it to benefit those people who have sacrificed singularly to make this society possible, give them preference.\n\nSo it is a form of super affirmative action, affirmation. And that should apply for a particular window period. Maybe over a 15 to 20 year period and it normalises thereafter, but that would be a very positive way of saying to people, when there is a job and the choice has to be Lionel Nicholas and myself, and if Lionel Nicholas but he had been a victim of gross human violations, that example, that is why I can use it, then one of us should get the preference for the job, because there has been that degree of suffering.\n\nThose are some of the practical suggestions that I would like to make to this process. The other thing is and this is particularly affecting me. There are people in society who are being paid by our tax money, who have been responsible for gross human violations, or actively colluded in gross human violations.\n\nWhy should our tax money be used to maintain them in either civil service, in either educational or other capacity?\n\nFor instance Amid Bauer, who is the principal of Natal University, Durban, was the Chief State witness against me in my trial. Why should he be paid with my tax money? He has never come to me to say I am sorry, I was a kid at that time, I was abused or whatever, he has never done anything like that. Why should that, I am giving you merely one example, why should that be?\n\nWhy should our money be used to carry those sorts of people whatever their current political affiliations are? So, I have covered in a sense some general issues, but also more particular ones which I think that the Commission should consider in its wisdom.\n\nCHAIRPERSON: Thank you Professor Cooper. Thank you for that and also for the personal angle, because I think really I mean it isn't the usual hearing this, and it is nice to get more anecdotal material. It is all being recorded.\n\nCan I bring you back to the legislative part of it? You mentioned the Mental Health Act and that it is being considered. Could you perhaps say a little bit more about what the, where it is at at the moment, your thoughts about the actual sort of philosophical strand overhead as it stands at the moment, and where it needs to be changed?\n\nMR COOPER: The Chairman, of this Commission was the Chief Director of Mental Health and (indistinct) and abuse, and she will know that when you are in such office, what happens is that you get put into a situation where you have to carry a lot of bureaucratees. There is almost an environmental push to get certain existing things sorted out, without consideration of the greater vision.\n\nAnd I think that the current encumbrance are actually trying to grapple with that mix. There is Melvin Freedman and there is Dr, who was previously at UDW, Ugan Pillay, who are in that division and are trying to get better legislation, but I think the philosophical basis of it should be our society has been a peculiarly disturbed one, given its abnormalcy.\n\nOur Mental Health Act ought to be predicated on that abnormalcy. It is not denying that we ought to make the apartheid base a precept, a key precept of well-beingness and that that Act ought to become rather than merely a reactive enablement for people, suffering mental distress and discomfort and serious illness, ought to be a proactive one towards creating a well-beingness, towards creating psyco-sosio oneness, equity, the intent of this Act under which the Commission is operating, so that we truly can integrate Mental Health into positive ways rather than just simply labelling them as we have done in the past.\n\nSo I think that that vision ought to be there, and the Commission would do well if it can impact on that legislative process, otherwise you can get State Attorneys who simply do (indistinct), alteration of Acts and try to bring them in line with the new constitution and new dispensation, but it is really the old functionalism in a new order, and will we not then be perpetuating a reactive process, rather than create a very proactive stance saying well-being is paramount and how do we look at the different elements of assisting create that well-being.\n\nYes, being reactive, providing tertiary but providing secondary and very importantly providing that primary preventative approach to Mental Health, and that means dealing with the issues arising out of race. In our society, right now, even though apartheid does not exist, it exists deeply etched in our individual and collective psyches.\n\nWhen we look at each other, we say well, that darkie, that whitie, and we are in two's about how good we are, what a great man Mandela is, but in our heart of hearts, we believe that actually kaffirs shouldn't be ruling.\n\nHow do we attend to that type of aspect in our society? I am talking about a deeply engrained racism which if we continue to gloss over, we will be creating future nightmares for our children to confront.\n\nLet the nightmare of the past be one that we at this time, hopefully in our maturity, come to terms with. All those things, I believe, ought to be informing that Mental Health legislation.\n\nCHAIRPERSON: Thank you. Can I maybe put it to the panel if they would like to ask Dr Cooper any more questions?\n\nMS WILDSCHUT: Although my name is here, I will say my name first as instructed by the Chairperson, Glenda Wildschut speaking. I wondered whether you have any comments on whether in the legislation, we should be considering (indistinct) more specifically, I know legislation is often more broadly written, so that people have some interpretation into the legislation, but we have had quite a lot of difficulty in the past with that legislation being interpreted in a very narrow medical model and should we not consider something in the legislation which would help us to include other treatment modalities in Mental Health care?\n\nMR COOPER: I think Glenda, that is very pertinent to what I am sure many of my colleagues, as I see them here, I see Dr Baqwa, I see the other colleagues in front here. I think that we and I am not excluding the other people, it is just because my line of sight is there, I think that it is important to include or make some sort of a preambilatory statement about utilising the richness of our cultural variables in society.\n\nBecause sometimes, and this is a debate that some of my colleagues know during the post-detention sort of interventions, sometimes, it may not be one on one, once a week intervention for years on end, that is going to work. It may be actually helping the person to connect with a few other people, doing some group work, or doing some community rehabilitative stuff where they can interact with others who have gone through the process and have come out more whole, that those types of modalities may be more important than doing text book one on one, classical western interventions, which actually are going to be very, very costly and you are going to then find you are creating like we have created fantastic jobs for lawyers in our new society, we are going to be creating fantastic jobs for psychologists, psychiatrists, psychiatric social workers and so on.\n\nI think the sooner we can put that in a sense down, away from those elites to community based interventions, so that if there is a serious community based intervention preference will be given to that, rather than keeping me in money and paying me to provide that service which is going to be too expensive and there are not enough psychologists as you know, and psychiatrists certainly, to go around to help.\n\nSo I would say the more community based there are and the more they have related to doing other things, getting on with your life like the stuff that I am sure, my colleagues, particularly Professor Seedat will address and the work they had been doing, in treating people like ordinary human beings, letting them get on with their lives rather than treating them as a special case that always needs to be continued with that umbra of this person is unwell, this person will continue being under the pall of receiving some tertiary intervention.\n\nSo I think community intervention is very important.\n\nMRS MKHIZE: Just one question, because to me knowledge is the gist of everything, including intervention and whatever functionaries we have to do as Mental Health profession. How do you think the Acts can facilitate the issues of creation of knowledge and the acquisition of knowledge or ownership of knowledge that integrates the cultural knowledge, the experiences which people have said in the field, as well as the social aspects. What I am trying to say here is that at the moment, we talk again and again about the fact of how we have used the knowledge, that is foreign to our practices as a guideline for what we are doing but I think we haven't done very much in terms of how can we facilitate the process of we as people, I shouldn't be saying as blacks, but everybody else who have had enough experience in the field, including the traditional healers, how can we facilitate a process where we can have, create our own knowledge, the knowledge that we can own and recognise and that will guide us in our operation?\n\nMR COOPER: I think that that one is a much more difficult one to address, because you see, there is an epistemological base in the society which is very clearly Euro-American in foundation.\n\nAnd to integrate cultural experiences, whether immediate or handed down over generations, into that ethic begins to be almost some form of atavism that you actually are going to wear a (indistinct) and so on and here we are a society wearing society you know suits and ties and dressed in a particular mode.\n\nI think it is incumbent on intellectuals to put forward their beliefs and I am saying without fear or favour, is actually missing the point, because you know that we are informed, essentially by a media that is ensconced in the western ethic, so that if you come with anything that begins to threaten that comfort zone, people are going to trash it.\n\nThat has been a position more recently with the call for an African renaissance and previously with Africanism and Black Consciousness and searching for different ways on intervening.\n\nSo I think it is up to the intellectuals within those fields, to come up with viable modalities, other wise you see, the advantage of the western system is it has been tried, it has been tested, it does work within particular contexts.\n\nTransposing them hocus bolus to ours, is an issue, but if we transpose them understanding the cultural issues in our society, and without just throwing the baby in the bath water off western intervention out, but saying X works, whereas W and Z won't, would be a way in the interim.\n\nBut I think it challenges leaders in the field to be more forthright about their belief systems. I don't think you can legislate for that. You can actually hint at being more culturally sensitive and being more historic in approach, rather than being totally ahistoric as we are in the society and transpose a Euro-Western modality or set of modalities of intervention.\n\nCHAIRPERSON: Thank you Dr Cooper. Can I maybe, I have just been handed a note - okay, Hlengiwe Mkhize would like to ask you another question.\n\nMRS MKHIZE: Thank you very much Sats for an exposition that you have given us. I just want to get your thoughts in this because for us, really it is important to make sure that we make recommendations which will be helpful in the process hopefully.\n\nRegarding you know, especially around the review of Mental Health Act and the issues around the Professional Board of Psychology that is very, very important because how the needs of people that you were referring to, are addressed, will be to a large extent, its success, will be determined by where the body which will address these is located.\n\nI mean, my limited experiences in the ministry of health was that what we were doing, really were working on reforms because by virtue of being located in that department for instance, psychiatry as a profession is well established and as much as there was a general move towards saying look, let's move towards community Mental Health care, clearly you could see that in reality the traditional way of handling mental health will dominate for many years to come, because people who are strong is there are people who are strong in terms of psychiatric care and those are the people who are in control and moving towards community Mental Health, was often seen as a chaos which one cannot manage.\n\nSo, I am still really not sure in my own mind, I mean, when before you came in I reviewed what the submission we have got from Victor Nel where he is talking of a, where he is proposing a human service. I have forgotten how we phrased it. I mean people who have read his work, they know what he has been calling for for a long period of time.\n\nBut it is like a human service department, which can accommodate more and more the expertise. You spoke about race related issues, which we know they are an issue in Mental Health if you look at Paul Saunderguard's work, it raises that a lot and many other people.\n\nBut I don't think within a Ministry of Health, it can be accommodated as a serious text. I just wanted your comment, I know you have spoken to it, but still there are gaps as to what are we saying.\n\nMR COOPER: Yes, there are a couple of issues there. The last one, first. I think it is a difficult one when we have inherited the old system and we have a (indistinct) of Ministries, particularly in the latter years of the previous government, they just started creating new Ministries.\n\nThe approach of, well that is the suggestion if I hear it correctly from Victor Nel, is one that is akin to what applies in the United States, Health and Human Services. That takes account of all health, all welfare, social interventions.\n\nBut, we have got - you need to also balance that against political territorial and other realities. Will a new government in power want to divest itself of some of those Ministries when it actually provides positions for patronage or other reasons for a lot of Ministers and a lot of Directors General and so on and so on?\n\nAnd my sense is that is going to be one of the hardest nuts to crack because rationalising those Ministries from the almost 30, to a smaller, more manageable number for a country of a fairly small size in world standards, is going to be a very difficult task. There is going to be all sorts or arguments when you know just four years ago, those same people were arguing what we are thinking.\n\nBut now that they are in there, it is not going to quite happen. So maybe we need somebody like the Commission, to actually say there ought to be some rationalisation here because we are getting fractured service delivery. Even if we don't consider it, the issue of an underpinning threat of human rights' violations (indistinct) in the apartheid past, just in sheer deliveries, service delivery terms, it is fractured one Ministry replicates what another Ministry does, the gross wastage and so on, just doesn't bear scrutiny.\n\nThat would feed into what the Mapaya Commission for instance is tasked with doing, in terms of suggesting a rationalised format, and maybe this Committee of the Commission, should be actually having some interaction by party interaction, in a sense, with that Commission and the Commission for Public Service at a broader level to say don't we have a gross human wastage? Our budget when at least 60 percent of it, goes to keeping the Civil Service, how on earth are we going to create the types of job opportunities, the types of other service delivery, infrastructure issues for a society, let alone those people affected by the apartheid past in the singular way that the Commission is looking at it.\n\nSo that may work and I think there will be support, certainly from the Private Sector and also from Sectors of the Media. They will support a reduction in the Civil Service.\n\nThe Civil Service will go screaming, but I think it is an issue that is so important that it may even be one that the Commission would want to ask for a National Referendum on. Do we deserve a tax base that is overwhelmingly geared at supporting Civil Service dependency or should we be looking at turning that around and creating the majority of the fiscal base for the nation.\n\nIt is something that the Commission could look at. In terms of where some of these issues are going to be located, I don't think you can really legislate things out of existence, neither do I think that you are going to succeed in legislating things into existence in a very simple manner, because we have got perhaps the most advanced constitutional democracy in the world for a very underdeveloped society and you are going to have all sorts of private initiatives, individual group, institutional initiatives which you are not going to curb, but I think that diversity will actually add to the process if we have got a central grouping that succeeds the Commission to look at servicing those victims for a limited period of time, we don't want to create another bureaucracy and another tax burden for a society that is already one of the most highly taxed in the world.\n\nBut for a very limited time, and that that should be open to appointment at that period, with some people from the Commission moving on to it, but also new appointments, but for a very temporary, fixed period of time to facilitate a process, rather than become the institution, providing it, so that they can monitor it, they can do it in different sectors in society, both private, public, the institutional other sectors.\n\nIn terms of psychology very specifically and the whole psychiatry and psychology debate, I actually think that maybe sometimes we have overplayed this one.\n\nI think that there is a very important role psychiatry plays, but it is a finite role. And psychiatry, I don't think has even pretended to want to be the (indistinct) in terms of well-beingness, it firmly rooted in the tertiary intervention modality, we don't have a social psychiatry, a primary community psychiatry movement in this country.\n\nAnd psychiatry does have a very important use, however, the other professionals allied, like psychology, social work, nursing and so on, should be playing an important role in shifting the (indistinct). I think in the past, psychology hasn't done that, because it was under medical hegemony.\n\nPsychology is beginning to do that and bear in mind, we have got at least ten to one, the number of psychologists providing mental health intervention than psychiatrists, so there are more of us and we are more trained in psyco-therapeutic techniques, which psychiatrists are not.\n\nSo, therefore we should be utilising that resource. The Government itself, the public service administration has determined that psychology is a scare resource. The Department of Health has prioritised psychology as second in terms of prioritising its health delivery system.\n\nNow, we need to use those as positive and turn them around. What is happening within organised psychology, is we are reviewing the whole basis of our training and looking at a new training dispensation for the future, very plainly, I, many of my colleagues sitting here, and others out there, believe we are training people or rather educating people with a major in psychology who are trained for nothing.\n\nThey annually join the list of jobless and unemployed in the country. If we were to be a little creative about it and create for instance a B-Psyche degree in keeping with international standards, create a four year degree in stead of that honours tagged on, which also doesn't give a person any professional status, a four year degree, you will find intersectional collaboration from social work and so on, to create a mental health counsellor, an Aids counsellor, a family counsellor, a personnel counsellor rather than a lower level psychologist.\n\nIn the second year they do a wide range of subjects in psychology. In the third and fourth years, they start specialising in particular fields of intervention possibilities and do an internship during that time - approximately nine months over two years.\n\nDo away with this masters level, if we add on one more year, you would get a D-Psyche degree including an internship and then you would actually have psychologists calling themselves Doctors, like happens in the rest of the advanced world.\n\nSo you create that stream. That doesn't mean you take away the academic or scientist stream. We are talking purely the practitioner route here and that is where we are making the suggestion that things should go. However, I should point out that the city universities, significantly white universities, are the ones that are going to go screaming into the new millennium on this process. Because in a sense they have the most comfort zones to loose, whereas the traditionally black and the newer Afrikaans institutions in a sense, they are African more than the other city Euro-American institutions.\n\nThey want to do it and for instance Transkei University, the University of Port Elizabeth are starting with a B-Psyche degree next year. And more people then will be employed in all sorts of areas and that group of people will be an invaluable human resource for change in the society.\n\nAs you know, the subject that is more favoured by first year university students, in urban and rural, black and white universities in this country, is psychology. This large number, and then you go into second year and third year and then when you go in to honours and masters, you have to have a graph that is a few hundred feet long, because it can't contain in one small linear depiction, because it doesn't bear scrutiny.\n\nOur masters' training is perhaps the most expensive of all the trainings in our society. Minister Zuma has talked about the medicals, but if you look at the psychology costs, they probably are at least one and a half times that of medicine.\n\nThat cannot be sustained in a developing society with the types of needs that we have, so we need to be realistic. So it has to be change that has to come from within as well.\n\nCHAIRPERSON: Thank you very much Dr Cooper. Thank you also for making this room feel very big. It was beginning to feel a little bit small and full and comprehensive.\n\nI just got a note from a Dr Madega Mabla who is representing Melvin Freedman, who is willing to answer some questions on legislation, but I feel you weren't here in the introduction, we are actually going to, it is a very task driven forum, this is not a sort of normal type hearing. I think we will have a chance tomorrow in the workshop to actually, and I think you have actually given us a lot of material which we can use to guide our thinking around the legislation.\n\nSo I would ask the Doctor to join that group tomorrow. In terms of time, we are not going to be able to open this section up to the floor and I would like to thank you very much, and hope you didn't feel too, as you say like (indistinct) when our job today is not to hold a glove over the coals, at these participants here.\n\nDR COOPER: I don't feel responsible for the past. I feel very responsible for the present and the future.\n\nCHAIRPERSON: Excellent. All right, if we could move on to the next section which in Psychiatric Interventions in Government Hospitals and Community Settings. Could I also invite participants and Dr Zanele Baqwa will be speaking to this and Ms Jeanette Mohapi, who is a Psychiatric nurse. If you could get to the table. Could I also invite participants to make notes with the view to tomorrow and really try to sort of think quite concretely about where we can go with these groups tomorrow, because we do want a product at the end of these two days, a very concrete product.\n\nI hope you will stay, Sats. Are you coming tomorrow? Okay, good.\n\nDR BAQWA: I would have loved to comment on what Sats was saying, because I have been doing a little bit of thinking about it, but I think if I want to split myself into two, which I tend to do, ever since I came back from exile, is that I would like to be part of that workshop on legislation as much as I am also, I know I am involved in another workshop on community Psychiatry because there are a lot of multi-variate factors in the process of changing rather than just change or reform as Hlengiwe was saying.\n\nLet me just now go to my submission which is I hope, won't bore you because I tend to have a sort of literary philosophic incline in everything I do. I don't know whether it is a talent.\n\nI have covered my submission in three parts and I would like to tell you what those parts involve. The first part I have just tried to introduce, my introduction was an attempt to depict in context the violence prevailing in our society, wherein I tried to pull a thread through organised violence from the apartheid area to the organised violence of the immediately pre and post-1994 periods, and also violence as manifested recently in what I term social violence including abuses of human rights in psychiatry institutions, what I term this whole part 1 as a prismatic view on our national psyche.\n\nPart 2, was sort of an examination of conduct and use of psychological interventions, by individuals and institutions in relation to conflicts of the past.\n\nI am looking at specific examples of practises at different psychiatric institutions today. I am looking at the disjuncture as it still exists today between psychiatric care for white and black patients. I am looking at antithetical views to human rights and human dignity at psychiatric hospitals. I am also taking a critic of psychiatric academic teaching of medical students and registrars much in line with what Sats was saying.\n\nI am also looking into the enquiry into the transformation and reconstruction attempts so far and I would like a little bit to have a critic at the TRC Health Sector Hearings of June 1997 in Cape Town, which I think it is called for. We always have to evaluate ourselves as we move on.\n\nPart 3 might go over to the workshop really, where I am looking at improving the legacy of apartheid on Health Care. Strategies that will consolidate and contribute to the prevention of gross human rights' violations and I think that is where that philosophical basis of the Mental Health Act and other ... (tape ends)\n\nUNKNOWN: ... may be used as slave labour and they were literally allowed to die from what could possibly be called criminal neglect.\n\nThese private psychiatric camps were set up with an agreement between the apartheid Department of Health and Smith Mitchell, which is now known as Lifecare.\n\nSubsidised by tax payers' money and hidden from public scrutiny, they remained a secret for almost a decade, before being discovered by us. In fact the government guaranteed a 90 percent occupancy rate and to meet this demand, psychiatrists used the Mental Health Act and the country's oppressive involuntary commitment laws.\n\nBriefly as our submission to the TRC shows, up to 10 000 Africans were incarcerated, many were reportedly excessively drugged, the majority of the 10 000 slept on mats on concrete floors, dormitories were crowded, squat toilets ran down the middle of the sleeping quarters and up to 30 patients at a time, shared communal showers more often without hot water.\n\nThe lack of beds was blamed on the patients. The Department of Health said like so many Africans they preferred to sleep on the floor.\n\nBlack patients died form easily treatable illnesses such as pneumonia or respiratory diseases. At least 80 African patients died each year.\n\nThe bodies of those patients who died, and whose families did not claim them, were used for anatomical studies. According to one annual company report, a suitable cement slab with drainage has been set up in our hospital mortuary for this purpose. Electric shock treatment was given without anaesthetic. The reason given for this by the Chief State Psychiatrist at the time, Dr P.H. Henning, was it is simply too expensive, too slow and too risky.\n\nAfricans appear to be more susceptible to the affects of anaesthetics and because we treat more Africans than whites, we would have to double our staff if we used anaesthetics.\n\nInmates were hired out to companies to perform labour without pay. Their days began at 05h30 am and ended at 05h30 pm. Contracted out to local companies, the labour force made coat hangers, wire brushes, rubber leg guards for miners, mats, sheets, clothes and aprons. This was called industrial therapy.\n\nIn 1975 articles ran in the Sunday Times and in the Rand Daily Mail. These articles confirmed the existence of thousands of black patients accommodated in converted mining compounds, mine hospitals and old hotels which the article concedes are a disgrace.\n\nMost of them ranged from the utterly dreary to the downright frightening. I am quoting now from these articles. Thousands of blacks who were neither criminal nor dangerous, are confined behind metal and barbed wire fences, have to use hideous single lockups and look like something out of (indistinct), have only crowded treeless quadrangles to relax in.\n\nThe usual treatment for blacks is shock treatment. The establishment of private psychiatric hospitals to incarcerate blacks, was one of many programmes implemented during the apartheid era to forward the suppression and the oppression of the black population.\n\nThere is no doubt that these institutions treated blacks differently to whites. There were in fact another facet of the primary architect of apartheid, psychologist Hendrik Verwoerd's vision of South Africa.\n\nWith millions of people faced with substandard education, unemployment, no opportunities and subsequently low moral, it is no wonder that these psychiatric camps could be established, or that the reactions to apartheid oppression was easily defined in psychiatric and psychological terms to justify their incarceration in psychiatric institutions.\n\nVarious reasons were given. Because the black South African broke curfew, or were considered decedents, others physically ill from the poverty caused by apartheid, sought help from general hospitals and were in stead transferred to private psychiatric camps via State institutions where they were literally turned into institutional cases.\n\nThousands of patients were syphoned out from State hospitals to use the words of a previous Commissioner of Health and contact with their families were severed.\n\nBecause of geographical distance, or because of forced removal of the family to a destination which remained unknown to the patient and the hospital authorities, in the sense the black South African had no community to return to even if he was eventually discharged.\n\nI would like to put it in a little bit more human terms and use a couple of examples and I won't use the patients' names. I will call them A and B.\n\nPatient A was admitted to Sterkfontein in May 1974 and transferred to Millside Hospital from Sterkfontein. Millside Hospital complex near Randfontein that is. In September 1974 his sister visited him and found that he was reported to have died from septicemia. The family then made arrangements to collect the body.\n\nWhen they arrived at Millside to do so, the body identified as their son, was not their son nor were any of the other bodies in the mortuary at the time or any of the living patients in the hospital.\n\nIn the mean time, the body labelled A had been buried by the authorities at Millside. There was no record of an inquest into the cause of his death.\n\nThe mystery has never been solved and A is still missing. When he was admitted to Sterkfontein, he had sceptic sores on his ankles and these for many of you who will know, are signs of pellagra, not mental illness.\n\nAnd that pellagra is defined in the world book dictionary as a disease marked by eruption of the skin, a nervous condition and sometimes insanity.\n\nThat A was allowed to die from an easily treatable illness and that those entrusted with his welfare and care regarded his disappearance with cold indifference, is an example of the lack of respect held for black people and how easily South Africans under the poor conditions many lived in, were frequently misdiagnosed with mental illness when the provision of proper medical care may have been all they needed.\n\nThen there is a case of a young black mentally handicapped male inmate, I will refer to him as patient B.\n\nB, a black mentally handicapped inmate of the Millside complex was taken home over a period of two years by two white male nurses and sexually abused.\n\nHe was also used to work in the garden, run errands and clean the house and on occasion was given a bit of money for that. As he later stated to one of the other nurses, in a full statement he gave to her, he was taken to a bed and pinned down.\n\nBoth of the male nurses then took turns in sexually abusing him and made him sleep in bed with them. The Mental Health Act provides for disciplinary action against staff members. It means discharge and the removal of his name from the register of the Council with which he is registered at the bare minimum.\n\nBoth male nurses had no disciplinary action taken against them, because the testimony of the mentally handicapped person was deemed to be unreliable and in fact from our information, they both are still working there and the one is promoted into a senior position.\n\nIn the grand scheme of apartheid times, where can we list cases such as A or B or the statistics of hundreds of unnecessary deaths due to exposure, neglect, electric convulsive therapy and other barbaric mental health practices?\n\nB's case might seem like the lesser abuse, but this case shows that the Mental Health Act of 1973 and its various amendments, serve to protect apartheid psychiatrists rather than the vulnerable citizens they were given the task of protecting and helping.\n\n115 patients went missing from at least one private psychiatric institution over an eight month period alone. A woman admitted her 80 year old father to a psychiatric hospital, believing he would get rest and care.\n\nWithin 24 hours, he was missing and within a week, he was found dead. What did the Health Authorities do about these incidents of abuse and the number of deaths that we reported to them? They did nothing.\n\nWhat did the South African Society of Psychiatrists do and its affiliated bodies do, they did nothing. And after they did nothing to correct the abuses, they did something. They amended the 1973 Mental Health Act, implementing Section 66(a), making it a criminal offence to publish information or photographs about the continuing crimes and abuses committed upon people in psychiatric institutions.\n\nCCHR has never been one to do nothing. We bypassed the local government authorities and psychiatric bodies, and took the matter to the United Nations which instigated a World Health Organisation investigation into the camps. The 1977 WHO reports confirmed the high number of deaths.\n\nWhat did the Health Authorities and SBS say and affiliated bodies do about the damning report? They did nothing and black South Africans continued to die at an alarming rate in these private psychiatric camps.\n\nSometimes up to 80 patients a year. According to WHO, the release of the WHO report and I am quoting from their statement there, the release of the WHO report was followed by a campaign of denials and attempts to cast doubt on its validity on the part of the South African officials and representatives of the medical establishment.\n\nThen the American Psychiatric Association did an inspection on the camps and in its 1979 report, the APA stated the most shocking finding of our investigation was the high number of needless deaths among black patients in Smith Mitchell facilities.\n\nAt none of the facilities did we find evidence of adequate medical care during the patient's final illness and further we saw charts of black patients in their 40's and 50's who were apparently allowed to die and further, there is good reason for international concern about black psychiatric patients in south Africa.\n\nWe found medical practises which were unacceptable and which resulted in needless deaths of black South Africans. This is an indication of possible gross criminal negligence and should have sent alarm bells to the Health and Psychiatric fraternity, it didn't.\n\nIn fact the APA report was condemned apparently because one of the APA members who officiated over the inspection, was yes, black. A subsequent 1983 report on this issue found although psychiatry is expected to be a medical discipline which deals with a human being as a whole, in no other medical field in South Africa is the contempt of the person cultivated by racism more concisely portrayed than in psychiatry.\n\nFurther quote - all the black patients, that is over 10 000 of them, are certified and transferred from institutions on an involuntary basis without their own or their family's involvement in the decision process.\n\nThe report concludes this situation has no parallel in the history and present state of psychiatric care. It certainly does have a parallel in the ownership and trading of slaves.\n\nThe dehumanised view of Africans cultivated by racism finds various expressions in psychiatry. One of them is the theory which relates certain forms of mental disorder to different levels of development of the races.\n\nThe long history of CCHR's fight to expose and rectify the gross apartheid human rights' abuses committed in the name of therapy by psychiatrists, affiliated with these camps, and within the Department of Health, is detailed in our submission.\n\nThe degree of attack levelled at us for having exposed these abuses internationally is also detailed. Suffice it to say our members were harassed, followed and activities were monitored by the Bureau of State Security, BOSS. It bears comment that if psychiatrists, health officials and the private psychiatric camps had nothing to hide, such a torrent of discrimination and attack, would never have been directed at us.\n\nWe also note that no representative of the private psychiatric facilities life care, appears to have, or are giving evidence to the TRC. Were they called to testify, have they made any approach to the TRC?\n\nHas David Tobasnic, Smith Mitchell's Director been called to account for what happened in his institutions? Where is Dr J.J. de Beer, psychiatrist and former Minister of Health who reportedly set up the agreements to channel blacks through Mr Tobasnic's facilities?\n\nNor has the SPSA's earlier submission to the TRC admitted any guilt or responsibility, it merely serves to continue to shoot at the messenger. In fact it is a white wash of the greatest psychiatric tragedy in the history of this country and one which continues to this day.\n\nIn 1991 staff at Millside Hospital complex, the Smith Mitchell or Lifecare facility, publicly complained about the high death rate from negligence and winter cold. Reportedly 35 mentally retarded children and youths also died between July 1988 and November 1990. 24 of them, as a result of pneumonia, tuberculosis and other respiratory ailments.\n\nChildren dying from the same conditions that patients 20 years ago, were dying from, is a disgrace. Tax payers' money was used to fund these death camps and while today, State facilities such as Valkenberg are to be closed down, these private psychiatric institutions with their sordid history of gross human rights' violations, remain open and profit from State subsidies.\n\nThere should be no compromise on this. These private psychiatric facilities must be shut down. Certainly there should not be State subsidies for these facilities at all.\n\nSection 66(a), the provision of the Mental Health Act which provides for the legal cover up of abuses being committed in psychiatric institutions generally, must also be abolished.\n\nFinally, and 27 years later, we are still waiting for answers. We are still waiting to see honesty, to hear admissions, to know that there is nothing left to hide and to see the SPSA, the Medical and Dental Council and individual psychiatrists who treated at the Smith Mitchell, Lifecare facilities, take responsibility.\n\nIn particular, we reiterate sections of our recommendations. Point 1, that all psychiatrists and psychologists found to have committed patient abuses in violation of a hypocritic oath, and other ethical codes during the apartheid era and especially in the Smith Mitchell psychiatric facilities, and who have not availed themselves of the TRC amnesty, be investigated and where there is evidence of criminal abuse or neglect, be prosecuted.\n\nPoint 2, in light of a gross human rights' violations committed in the private psychiatric institutions, all records and documentation must be subpoenaed from the Department of Health, Lifecare and formerly Smith Mitchell and the individual Lifecare psychiatric facilities which would cover and determine how many death occurred in the private psychiatric facilities over the last 20 years, what drug experimentation and sexual abuse of patients in these facilities, has occurred.\n\nFrom these, there should be an investigation of (a) the drug practices within these facilities and any cause or link to any death, (b) who the medical officers were who had the responsibility to investigate and report on each death and who did they report to and what annual reports exist on the deaths in psychiatric institutions, (c) all records and documentation regarding the burial of patients who died at the Smith Mitchell facilities should be subpoenaed from funeral parlours and a determination be made as to where there were communal burials, and if so, where these are, (d) all records, memo's, correspondence and reports held by the SPSA in relation to this Smith Mitchell facilities, during apartheid, should be subpoenaed to determine to what degree the failure of the SPSA to carry out proper, independent review of the medical records of patients who had died in private psychiatric facilities, may have contributed to prevailing human right's abuses and deaths occurring in these institutions.\n\nWe have made many recommendations for reforms based on our history of successfully fighting for patients' rights. We are not anti-medicine. We believe in proper and competent medical care. We believe in the right for people to seek help from traditional healers and all this we will present at the workshop tomorrow, under the heading of the way forward.\n\nThe continued silence by South African psychiatrists with the exception of one or two, like Professor Simpson and especially by the SPSA in the face of gross human rights' violations, having been committed within their camp, is unconscionable.\n\nDuring apartheid, the SPSA claimed that it inspected the Smith Mitchell facilities, and found no support or allegations of inadequate psychiatric care and that extensive and advanced psychiatric services were given to all South Africans without reference to colour or creed.\n\nThis was a lie when you review this against the findings of the World Health Organisation and the American Psychiatric Association reports. During the American Association for the Advancement for Science's visit in 1989, the Statement released by the society again echoed the lack of responsibility and contradicted their constitution which is to uphold the principle of human dignity and psychiatric ethics.\n\nThe society stressed to the AAAS delegation that although they were inspecting the facilities, the responsibility for psychiatric care was not that of the society and it distanced itself completely from the treatment and handling of patients in these institutions.\n\nThis too is false. If the SPSA monitors the ethics and practises of psychiatrists, it should be ensuring that proper care is being given by them. The Nazi holocaust and apartheid have common realities. Without the driving forces of psychiatry and psychology, the holocaust and apartheid would simply not have happened.\n\nAnd I think our next submission will give you more information on that. While we certainly believe in forgiveness, the first step towards this, is for psychiatrists and psychologists who actively participated in apartheid, to come forward to the TRC and to admit their crimes.\n\nThose who remain complacent or justify their actions as just doing their job, or claim that psychiatrists were a tool of political corruption, should be rooted out to meet criminal, not disciplinary charges. They must not be able to evade the consequences of their actions. As a protection against current and future psychiatric and psychological abuse, CCHR recommends that a loyalty oath of mental practice be implemented which we will present at the workshops tomorrow.\n\nAll available medical, professional and ethical codes have failed to ensure compliance by professionals in South Africa's Mental Health industry.\n\nCCHR's loyalty oath of mental practice should be signed by all psychiatrists and psychologists, psyco-therapists etc, before they are allowed to practice, especially when employed by the State. The oath requires the practitioner to sign this and as a legal document,legal action can be taken against the professional who violates it.\n\nFinally today, we call on the TRC to unequivably condemn the psychiatric abuses that have been committed against South Africans in psychiatric facilities and condemn those professional bodies, health authorities and practitioners, who were a party to them. Thank you.\n\nCHAIRPERSON: Thank you very much. Just before I put it to the panel for questions, I am curious but I think it will be getting off the subject to examine the relationship between CCHR and Scientology?\n\nUNKNOWN: I can answer that quite easily. CCHR was established by the Church of Scientology when it was Scientology that first noticed the gross abuses that were going on in institutions.\n\nIt is not Scientology's mandate to get involved in investigating and exposing abuses, but to forward its ideology of Scientology. So it established an independent social reform body to carry out that function, and that was done in 1969.\n\nCHAIRPERSON: Okay, thanks. I would have caught you at lunch for that answer, any way. Okay, can I put it to the panel for questions?\n\nMRS MKHIZE: Paul, thank you very much, this is the second time. We missed this opportunity to interact with you when we had our Health Hearings, but I just wanted to ask you for interest sake, one question.\n\nWhy are you not so popular, by you I mean your initiative within established groups, not only here, world wide? I mean it might sound like an unfair question.\n\nWhat you have said, it makes a lot of sense, but you scare people off, why is that?\n\nUNKNOWN: Well, the thing is that we go straight for the truth, we confront a lot of the crimes and abuses that occur in the mental health field, that many other people don't want to confront or deny are there.\n\nWe certainly with the Smith Mitchell exposure, were heavily attacked because we are attacking major vested interests both from a business and a psychiatric point of view and people don't like to be shown up for what they are doing. We are a watch dog of the mental health field. And we will look in every nook and cranny to find the abuses to ensure that our mandate is carried out, which is to clean up the field of mental health.\n\nIf we were popular, I would say that we weren't doing our job properly.\n\nCHAIRPERSON: Thank you.\n\nMRS MKHIZE: Just one last question. You see, I don't know, I mean it might not be relevant for our need, but sometimes as I was going through your submission, it is like you deny the relevance of the biological explanation of people's problems completely. I don't know whether I understood what you are saying, very well.\n\nI know for the purpose of human rights, our concern, that is really not a problem except that sometimes, we might refer our people to psychiatrists who work within a biological model, but when I was going through this, it was like as far as you are concerned,the biological explanation of people's psychological problem is a farce?\n\nUNKNOWN: I think the answer to that is psychiatry and psychology predominantly believe that man is an animal, which comes from studies done by Willem Wund and the stimulant response, studies done by Pavlov to quote just a couple.\n\nWe believe that man is a spiritual being and as a spiritual being, it is that nature of man that needs to be approached when he has a mental problem.\n\nAnd that if you are looking at it in that context, as man a spiritual being, then it is function over structure which is the opposite of man being an animal, which is structure over function.\n\nDoes that answer your question?\n\nMRS MKHIZE: I am sure these people will follow that up, because some will argue that there are other beings besides the spiritual component.\n\nUNKNOWN: Well, the belief is that man is as a spiritual being, is a spirit, has a mind and has a body and you approach all three of those, whereas when you look at the standard view point of psychiatry or psychology, they say that the mind is the brain.\n\nWe don't agree with that. If man is a spiritual being, then surely his mind is an external, non-physical entity that manages this structure of the body.\n\nCHAIRPERSON: Okay, I think that will continue, that debate. Can I just say looking to the section, we did say the use of psychology and psychiatry as an instrument for political repression, I don't think we have talked about sort of, I think we have touched on social repression, but I don't think we necessarily political repression.\n\nI think the indications we have had are quite broad, going back to the Police and the Military and I think we are still yet to pin down psychology and psychiatry's ...\n\nUNKNOWN: Well, in summarising down a 150 page submission, we had the dilemma of how do we fit that in into half an hour and with the arrangement made yesterday, we have managed to organise to have it split into two parts.\n\nCertainly this is very relevant and we do want to see the recommendations we have made on the Smith Mitchell facilities, take place and on the political repression's side, Mr Lawrence Anthony will be covering that as we certainly couldn't have got this down into half an hour.\n\nCHAIRPERSON: Okay, thanks. All right, then if we all break for lunch now, which I believe is next door. I presume it is here.\n\nCOMMISSION ADJOURNS\n\nON RESUMPTION:\n\nCHAIRPERSON: I am going to introduce Dr Bhana from KwaZulu Natal, thanks for coming. You are one of the ones that have come from far, far away. It depends on how you look at that, in miles or sort of political situation.\n\nWe look a little bit sparser than we did before lunch, it is a bit concerning, but I would like you to make your submission.\n\nDR BHANA: Thank you. It is interesting that in the submission made by Sats this morning, he reminded me of something I had actually repressed quite effectively, namely my own period of incarceration which ... (tape ends) ... it seems to be for us in KwaZulu Natal, a pretty important area.\n\nI will talk about that just now. Before I sort of go on, let me just give some background to this submission that I make it as a former member of Progressive Organisation, namely OASSA, the Organisation for Alternative Social Services in South Africa which was involved in attempting to provide alternative social services for individuals and communities at the time of the rule of the former apartheid government.\n\nIn doing so, I wish to draw attention to the fact that an earlier submission was made by my colleague in Cape Town, Ann Harper. I unfortunately was unable to get that submission to inform my own, but nevertheless.\n\nI also am somewhat humbled by being asked to make this presentation, because I think there are probably many individuals and organisations out there actively involved in rehabilitation and reparation who are possibly better qualified than I am in making the submission.\n\nA name that comes to mind for example, is Blade Nzimandi who was clearly at the heart of the conflict in KwaZulu Natal, in terms of observing that process and so I would like to make it plain then that I do not officially represent any particular organisation. I make this submission to add to those that came before and also in the short time that was afforded me in getting this together, which is about two days, less, I have managed to speak to a few colleagues etc and run some of this by them, but clearly the final form of submission, will come to you with lots more comment by a number of individuals.\n\nLet me just say that the submission I am making, is based on the information from a wide variety of documents, that OASSA itself produced and I think it probably was a pretty good tying in terms of documenting the events, experiences etc, that occurred and it was probably one of the more prolific periods around documenting issues affecting individuals, organisations, communities around of the affects of the apartheid system on the mental health of individuals and societies, communities.\n\nOASSA had a number of conferences, four in all in fact, annual conferences. I have taken information from those documents as well as from mental health practitioners, involved in providing services to individuals and organisations and from academics who wrote about the influence of an apartheid system on the mental health of individuals and communities.\n\nThe submission by SAISA provides a useful backdrop to what I am about to say. As an Organisation OASSA was formed in 1983 to develop more appropriate mental and social health services at a time when the repression of the apartheid State had increased significantly.\n\nIt had a broad base of activity which included research, education, media and emergency services, including what was at that time called detainee services.\n\nThe organisation aligned itself with the Mass Democratic Movement of the time, and its mission statement if you want to call it that, was that it was vigorously opposed to apartheid and economic exploitation as well as social policies that were directly responsible for producing ill health.\n\nHowever, OASSA came into being because Mental Health Services were almost without exception unresponsive to what (indistinct) called the social context of deprivation.\n\nA deep cynicism of a family therapy association in the 80's, in the early 1980's, was witnessed when it decided to host its conference at Sun City while (indistinct) about the breakdown of the family system in South Africa, was I think something that resolved many individuals that this type of myopic perception of mental health in South Africa could no longer be (indistinct).\n\nEssentially, the connection between health, mental health and the social context of deprivation particularly, suggested that those who fell within a lower socio-economic structure, received indifferent mental health services if at all. To this day, the provision of mental health services continues to be selectively provided to those who can pay and who are located in urban areas, while little exist for those in rural areas.\n\nOASSA has sought to highlight the intrinsic relationship between poor mental health and apartheid and between apartheid and poverty and to find ways of countering these influences.\n\nThe relationship between politics and economics and its overwhelming influence in social conditions, could be seen everywhere, it was discussed nowhere.\n\nIt was one of the other sort of real light motives to this organisation that we could talk about it as colleagues, we could talk about things that were going around, but we never actually organised around it. There was sort of a major impetus that was building to get to the point where OASSA was formed.\n\nInitially, much of the work that OASSA was doing, was in support of activists in townships, direct support through counselling, training workshops and recognising and dealing with individuals, showing classic signs of trauma and together with NAMDA holding first aid workshops to deal with injuries from buckshot and the like because hospitals could not be trusted for good reasons and which have been provided at this hearing.\n\nOne of its tasks, as one of its tasks, OASSA sought to dispel the naive contention among mental health professionals that politics and mental health practise should be kept separate as it was argued that it influences the objectivity of the professional. This is something that Mohammed has already referred to, that the Scientism of underpending professional activity was used to advance the idea of the dispassionate, uninvolved a-political professional much like the church using its doctrines to justify its (indistinct) to the pain and suffering of South Africans.\n\nWhen OASSA entered the (indistinct), charging academics and academic departments of using science to support the work of the State.\n\nNotable HSRC, CSIR are organisations that had been directly involved in this type of activity. Fortunately there had been some significant changes to that level. But also at a level and a type of research and training that was taking place within various institutions.\n\nAmerican and European psychology was pursued as the standard because it had all sorts of racial implications and that this has had an impact in terms of the psychology that is actually practised today.\n\nThe development of an indigenous psychology is difficult to see around one. The impetus to develop an indigenous psychology appears to be only gaining ground recently and part of the impact of the apartheid ideology and the establishment of universities which essentially were meant to produce mediocrity, was that an indigenous psychology was not readily apparent in any of the research or the material that was produced.\n\nIt was perhaps the clear association between politics and mental health that epitomised OASSA that helped it to refocus the attention of health care workers on a need for social change as part of an effective treatment plan.\n\nIt also marked a shift towards a more humanitarian mental health practice. The problem was not always one of bad genes or bad luck or even just a poor environment, but one that the majority of South Africans found themselves in through the systematic application of the apartheid ideology.\n\nI have a number of objectives that OASSA actually outlines and I am not going to go through all of them and I am just going to pick just on a few here in the interest of time.\n\nBut clearly it was to provide a better mental health service to individuals who had no access to such services. To help other progressive movements in dealing with its own fallouts. Today we talk about burnout, it those times we talked of people who were severely psychologically damaged as a function of torture etc.\n\nThere was a strong debate that occurred within OASSA about should we do research on the affects of apartheid on individuals and the concern was that this research would simply be used by the State in furthering its own ends.\n\nAnd that debate obviously meant that some of the research that would have been done, was not done. Nevertheless, it did clearly see the need to redistribute and develop knowledge, experience and skills, workshops, conferences, publications and by the collection and dissemination of relevant information.\n\nIt also saw the need to unite health workers across the specialised fields of activity, social workers, nurses, psychologists, psychiatrists, doctors all tended to operate in terms of their own particular training and philosophy and there was a need to see that health was not the prerogative. Any one of those and there shouldn't be a pecking order and so that is one of the things that was also attempted. I am not sure to what extent this was successful.\n\nAnother objective was to develop structural models of appropriate social services, to assist wherever possible with the implementation. When we look at these, and I have a number of them here, these objectives, it is evident that many if not all of these needs are even more evident today.\n\nThe advent of democracy in South Africa has had the effect of refocussing the energies of progressive organisations from challenging the State to find ways of cooperating and assisting the newly elected democratic government to provide many of these services.\n\nThe destructive forces of apartheid had held together many ideologically individuals and there were clearly many people within OASSA who could be at completely different acts of the spectrum ideologically, but who together in the interest of fighting against the oppressive system of apartheid. Once the system disappeared at least in terms of a significant event, the cohesiveness that characterised most progressive organisations at that time, appeared also to have disappeared.\n\nWhile new progressive groupings have emerged, the single minded focus and energy of early organisations appear to be lacking. The way forward was now faced with innumerable permutations and never ending rounds of workshops which served merely to signify that there was great uncertainty about how to proceed.\n\nI can say this with some degree of certainty for example the Mental Health Act and what should go into the new Mental Health Act, etc. Neither government nor progressive groups could foresee the enormous difficulties involved in social transformation. It is one thing making an argument, an eloquent one at that for change, it was quite another to produce change that would have the desired impact.\n\nThe challenges facing mental health services, can be seen everywhere from Health, Welfare and Education to Housing and Safety and Security. I believe though that progressive organisations have yet to find their voice in this new dispensation.\n\nAn independent and critical Mental Health grouping is vital in ensuring that there is continued focus and providing services to those who are marginalised. I believe the legitimising of SAISA was an important step in beginning to address some of the issues relating to providing services especially to the poor and those who are not urbanised.\n\nIronically the need for mental health services is as great today as it was prior to 1994 if not more so.\n\nIn KwaZulu Natal, youth who had given up much in the struggle for liberation, today find themselves unskilled, unemployed and psychological defeated into personal violence, substance abuse and crime, are (indistinct) to their lives.\n\nThese individuals feel little hope, because little has changed for them, but also because there has never been available mental health services that would help them to heal and I think this is the point I made with the personal statement about many of us that may have gone through a period when we directly faced the oppressiveness of the apartheid system, but were made to deal with it or dealt with it or did not deal with it, but it became or was repressed.\n\nFor many of these individuals the period in which the experienced repression in massive amounts, the ability of OASSA to respond or of any progressive organisation, including NAMDA etc, to the needs of these individuals was sharply limited.\n\nIn 1986, at the first OASSA conference Patel reflected on the issues confronting black families at that time. These words that she spoke at that time, represent a painful reality of problems of old, that are still very much with us.\n\nI quote - in the present South African conflict a new generation is emerging who knows only violent conflict, rather than how to express their feelings or to love. The task is to fight and to survive. The social milieu is one which encourages the suppression of feelings as being heroic and the expression of it as cowardice.\n\nNo doubt, the effects of the present conflict will leave lasting scars on generations to come. In a personal communication with Freddie Staborough who is the co-ordinator of a group that runs trauma workshops, counselling groups etc, in Port Shepstone area on the south coast of KwaZulu Natal, told me about how the effects of the lack of services is having accumulative effect on individuals.\n\nIf you will recall, the recent bus accident where in a number of Inkatha Freedom Party members died, threw up a host of underlying psychological problems among the families and survivors.\n\nWhat really was going on here, was that earlier traumas experienced in the bitter political fighting leading up to the elections and since then, had never been resolved.\n\nThe trauma suffered originally was not dealt with because of a lack of mental practitioners who work in rural areas, inadequate mental health services in general, as well as the historical neglect, not to forget destructiveness of the policies of the apartheid system enforced by the previous elite.\n\nCulture demands that individuals learn to cope with such events, further contributes to a (indistinct) attitude of trauma. In keeping with the classic trauma model, poor coping and a lack of support to ensure the wellbeing of this individuals, have led to a decrement in coping resources thereby making them even more vulnerable to minor or unexpected stresses.\n\nLack of resources and the almost complete absence of any psychological services for such individuals ...\n\nCHAIRPERSON: Sorry Doctor, sorry Doctor.\n\nDR BHANA: The lack of resources and the almost complete absence of any psychological services for such individuals means that the frustration and inability to deal with traumatic events, leads to acting out in the form of spouse and child abuse as well as substance abuse. The cycle of violence continues.\n\nIn a chilling statement, around the issue of AIDS in KwaZulu Natal among a segment of youth in the townships, a chilling statement is infect one, infect all which essentially says and let me preface this with the explanations given for the cohesiveness and the togetherness of youth, is that in the struggle, in the time of the struggle, they bonded. They work together, they supported each other, they looked after each other. That bond still exists.\n\nNow, what has happened, is that AIDS has presented itself and in the context of that particular event, they have recognised for themselves that there is little hope for them. These individuals have now embarked on a cycle of self-destructive behaviour. They don't want to have any tests done on them that would reflect whether they are AIDS positive or not. They recognise that sexual conduct or sexual behaviour is closely linked with interpersonal violence, the use of safety measures is often issues around the demands of the male over the female, which often results in violence.\n\nSo both males and females recognise that they are trapped in the situation and that they will live life for the day. I am not going to give a lengthy submission of this, I will in the report that I submit to you, that the effects of the apartheid system are I think only, my view is that we are only beginning to understand the sort of deep-seated effects of this.\n\nNot only among people, older individuals, but among the youth. The premise for the existence of OASSA was that the State was neglectful at deliberately destructive with regard to the mental health of its citizens. The New South Africa has not changed reality for most South Africans, and especially those in KwaZulu Natal with political conflict is still ongoing.\n\nShobashobane and Richmond are points in example. If mental health workers are to break the cycle of violence, which is now feeding on itself and it can no longer ignore, desperate need for mental health service is part of a primary health care model.\n\nThe need for training institutions to examine the relationship to broader context, especially with reference to an African character was recognised as early as in 1986 at that first OASSA conference.\n\nTraining student nurses, students, nurses and volunteers as lay counsellors and Sats has already mentioned the model that SAISA is adopting and pursuing, is a useful and important first step in helping to break the cycle of violence because my submission earlier on was that if one does not provide services, especially to these individuals where nothing really exists, the cycle of violence continues. It simply reproduces itself in different forms and it may not be called political any more, but the violence continues.\n\nTrauma counselling skills can and should become part of the training of primary health care personnel. Systematic efforts that bring together the training programmes of health departments, community organisations, including churches and various NGO's involved in doing trauma counselling, should be prioritised as a major mental health initiative.\n\nWhereas previously the State and progressive organisations were in opposition to each other, the need is for new partnerships between these two sectors. The need is greater in fact, than ever.\n\nThe Department of Health Education and Welfare should strife to promote delivery of services through partnerships with those community organisations, NGO's, etc rather than attempt to say we will provide mental health services to all. It is not going to happen.\n\nProfessional associations such as SAISA as I pointed out earlier, promoting the broadening the (indistinct) such as lay counsellors in various areas, is vital to creating a humanitarian psychology, and must be applauded.\n\nPrevention programmes that focus on developing viable conflict reduction models within our schools, should be seriously considered as part of an Education curriculum. If you talk to youth today, the solution to any problem is to fight or engage in some form of behaviour that leads to injury of another person.\n\nIt is almost an automatic response. NGO's such as a Trauma Counselling network that is active in Port Shepstone on the south coast of KwaZulu Natal, play a vital role in service delivery. They are in fact the only ones who train individuals around trauma counselling.\n\nCurrently various models are available to make this a workable prospect and I will present a separate submission where these models are provided. It is not for me to go into them here.\n\nWhat I would like to say in conclusion merely is that the State needs to enter into partnership with such NGO's to provide training that is relevant to the needs of particular communities. It should not rely or even expect the formalised health sector to be able to meet the needs of survivors of violence.\n\nI would stop there.\n\nCHAIRPERSON: Thank you for saying what you did, not stopping. I've got a question before I put it to the panel.\n\nWe put your submission underneath a section of contributions of progressive organisations. I know in such short notice, you had to do a broad, but I am curious. Are we saying that progressive thinking or organisations or - have sort of somewhat been diluted since?\n\nDR BHANA: In terms of the way in which OASSA operated, or even NAMDA for example, the single minded focus that they have because there was a common enemy, the differences could be simply ignored and work towards a common goal, was often something that motivated many people.\n\nWhat has happened since is that in the (indistinct) between the transition and a transformations that are taking place, defining roles, relationships, where people fit etc, has not occurred in a very smooth way. Which is with hindsight, to be expected.\n\nIn addition, individuals have, some individuals and a lot of those individuals have experienced burnout and have said I want time for myself, etc and have gone off to do things which they have felt they have neglected in all this time.\n\nMany of these individuals have also joined the government, so their world continues, but no longer as this easily identifiable common united force for social change and I think to some extent that role is slowly being picked up by the NGO's, etc, and they should be fully supported because I think it is important for those sectors to be the conscience of the State to point out the inadequacies, to point out the need for services etc, and where they should be delivered etc.\n\nBecause they are closer to the people and their needs than any State department, health department, any education department, etc. I think that is where the shift is occurring.\n\nCHAIRPERSON: Do you think there is a racial split in terms of progressive thinking about psychology or I mean, is there a split within psychology, different schools, essentially Afrikaans schools or I am spreading them, I am polarising them, but I mean is there a black culture of psychology developing and the white, is it integrated? Can you fill me in?\n\nDR BHANA: That is a hype question to answer. Perhaps my colleagues can help me there. What has changed is that the content matter of psychology has shifted. In some places it may not have shifted as substantially, but it has shifted.\n\nWhat is also changing, the question was asked earlier about how does one encourage and develop new leadership, new researches, new intellectuals? Part of that has to do with for example one of the journals in psychology there are essentially two journals in this country. The one is the South African Journal of Psychology which was, well if people talked about irrelevant, that was it.\n\nIt was irrelevant. It had publications that talked about stuff that nobody could really understand or even considered. It was like you could be on a different planet.\n\nPsychology in Society came out as an alternative to that and some very useful work has been published in that particular journal.\n\nThe journals have shifted since then. One of the policies that has emerged at least in terms of Psychology in Society, is that people talked about the difficulty of writing, and there is always the difficulty of writing for lots of different reasons.\n\nBut when people now write and submit articles or whatever, whatever it is that they submit to for example Psychology in Society, the Editor then works with that person to get the article published. It is no longer we send it out to your reviewers and we will do a scrutiny of it and reject or accept it.\n\nAnother sort of development has been under the sort of leadership of Norman Duncan, the special issue on by the South African Journal of Psychology, around black authorship, trying to encourage black authors to ... (tape ends) ... but it is more than just the question of representivity, because if you look only at that level, it is easy to have old wine in new bottles. You just produce a black face, or put a woman who is reproducing the old concepts and the old ideas without creating a genuine shift in what we should be looking at, does it represent the world view of this country's population?\n\nDoes it look at for instance the majority of the people, of this country's people are not violent. They have not engaged in violent behaviour, how is it that the majority have succeeded in being resilient and in maintaining the humanity despite the cross levels of dehumanisation that has perpetuated through the exploitative system?\n\nWhen psychologists investigate and research, they always look for deficits, they are always looking for pathology because they are ready to attach a label. I think if we can recommend that the intellectuals, social scientists in particular begin to relook at how to investigate the phenomena that are of paramount importance for service delivery and for the teaching programmes that students go through each year, that we should be looking at without dramatising exploitation and oppression, we should be looking at the resiliency of this country's people and how that can be harnessed to promote positive mental health for all South Africans, given that we are never going to be able to in the short or mid-term, produce the kind of mental health workers we require at the level of service delivery.\n\nWe have to get creative and really look at the organic systems of healing that underserved and unserved communities have forged in promoting their own well-being.\n\nIn conclusion to my very brief presentation, for many people what I said may be old hat, but it bears repetition, because for most psychologists they have not acknowledged the omission at the level of knowledge production. They have not acknowledged the biases, the distorted images of blacks and women that occur in psychological literature.\n\nPsychologists, organised psychology is yet to acknowledge this complicity and the exclusion that they systematically, perpetuated by virtue of silence. At the same time, right now there is a thrust of those of us who work partly or fully within academic institutions will know, that the publish or perish phenomena has arrived in South Africa and so there is a major thrust to publish irrespective of what you publish, the social relevance is ignored.\n\nWhether it is linked to transformation, the promotion of democracy is ignored, and when such questions do come up, one is very squarely and clearly told that that has nothing to do with psychology or with academia, that academia is neutral. And yet, historically if you look at it, it has never been neutral.\n\nSo I am hoping that in the discussions that unfold, this kind of area be taken up, we not be able to legislate against people pursuing certain kinds of research but we can certainly create mechanisms that discourage omission. Thank you.\n\nCHAIRPERSON: Thank you very much. Thank you for being brief. Given that you have been brief, would the panel like to respond?\n\nI would like to respond first of all before I give my colleagues a chance. Do you have any suggestions as to a kind of new system of production of knowledge? I need to put some thought towards that?\n\nMR BHANA: It is easier to critic than to formulate constructive recommendations, and I recognise that. It is a very difficult area to cope with and to deal with, but I think at a very basic level, institutions that produce knowledge, need to be encouraged and they need to be very strong reinforcers to ensure that at a primary level there is representativity.\n\nThat the systems producing knowledge represent various interest groups and the diversity that this country contains. It is absolutely important.\n\nSecondly to really look at creating those think tanks that receive institutional and political support and these think tanks really need to look at, or be encouraged to examine from another perspective and to (indistinct) theoretical analysis from creative perspectives.\n\nI think you know, that is perhaps a life long endeavour, but really to take the chances and to be encouraged that production of knowledge is not related just to publications. Most academics find that their jobs and their job security is related to the number of publications that they churn out and that needs to be discouraged if we really want to create incentives for people to take risks, and to be asking questions that they hadn't asked before.\n\nI think there is a lot of creative ideas, people have at an intellectual level, they have the (indistinct) of ideas and projects that they would like to embark on, but it is the mechanisms that enable that, that needs to be set in place.\n\nIt isn't so much that there isn't a willingness. I think you can easily put together in each province, a major think tank that look at production of knowledge for a comprehensive mental health system.\n\nIt is really looking at what will enable that.\n\nCHAIRPERSON: Thank you. Panel? Dr Wendy Orr?\n\nDR ORR: I think you probably answered part of my question in your reply to the previous question, but I was going to ask if there is any discussion within an academic circles and between universities and tertiary educational institutions about the kind of issues that you are raising, and if not, is there anything that the Truth Commission or the profession can do to try and facilitate and kickstart this kind of discussion?\n\nDR BHANA: I think Irwin is probably going to talk about that later when he looks as progressive attempts. There are pockets of activity,these are really marginal voices that continue to try in addition to their full time jobs on the side kind of, as an appendix to their regular jobs, to carry for the activity and I think what that needs, that kind of activity needs to be centralised, instead of kept (indistinct) and the Commission would do well to work through institutions such as the CSD, the HSRC - all of the major research bodies, or the bodies that fund research need to be encouraged and need to have the appropriate political endorsement, to centralise activity that is going to enable the democratisation of knowledge as well as the production of relevant our bodies of knowledge. So it is really essentially working through the institutions that support research.\n\nMS WILDSCHUT: It is Glenda Wildschut again. Looking at the collaborative study that was done sort of World Mental Health activities, and looking through that report, it became very clear to me that very little work has been done in examining the relationship between structural violence and interpersonal violence.\n\nRather a lot of work has been done in looking at the causes and the nature and extend of interpersonal violence at different levels, whether it be political and so on. And it seems to be that that is an endeavour. That is something that is very important for this country that we have come through a long period of structural, institutionalised violence through legislation, etc, etc and what impact that has on interpersonal violence, and every time one looks at the report in the newspaper, people individualise almost the escalating violence that we have and attribute all kinds of reasons to that.\n\nIt seems to be this lack of understanding between structural apartheid and structural - if you can comment on that. ... personal story in that the issue around rioting or (indistinct) observations that one has made and so on, and try to make sense of that, is also an issue of confidence and that if one is not in an academic environment, it is very difficult to actually write because one doesn't have that kind of support and confidence in actually writing that and I think as you mentioned it is a good idea to in a sense, create a milieu where people who are in a non-academic environment can actually begin to develop that confidence and to be able to write down what kind of observations people are making.\n\nIt is interesting to note that in your review, the more relevant writing and research is being done by alternative organisations such as OASSA and other non-academic institutions. It is often to those works, that one has to look in order to make sense of some of the things I have mentioned about the relationship between structural violence and interpersonal violence.\n\nDR BHANA: If you read the written submission, you will see that historically most of the writing emerged from white English speaking or white Afrikaans speaking universities, and even up to now, academics associated with the historically black institutions, hardly ever write for a whole host of reasons, but there is definitely the issue of confidence, the issue of being over-awed by the idea of writing and the research continues to be mystified and couched in esoteric terms and the attempts by black academics to engage with research, is discouraged for obvious reasons, but it is always presented as something that is a preserve of geniuses.\n\nThat it is not ordinary human beings who can research and write and unfortunately the only geniuses you get in this country, happen to be white. That is a major problem. At that level, it is quite important to be looking at these institutions and encouraging and developing these think tanks and these writing forums where people are encouraged and enabled to write and create a space for writing.\n\nIf you look at the student numbers for instance between UCT and Western Cape, you understand why people in the Western Cape don't have the time for that. At organisational level, the demands differ.\n\nAs far as coming back to your first issue of violence, I want to say that those who have the power to define the problem, also have the power to define the solutions. Historically violence in this country has taken on various definitions.\n\nIn the former years of institutionalised apartheid, it was defined as a black on black problem, blacks killing blacks. Inkatha/ANC problem. It is now being rapidly being redefined as a criminal phenomena that if you lock everybody up that is violent, we will have peace in this country.\n\nOne wonders why these selective definitions of violence continue to pervade the media, pub"
