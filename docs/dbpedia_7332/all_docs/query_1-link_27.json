        "text": "Live rugby has many moments one has to look forward too. Atmosphere, beer, great tries and of course, the home team’s cheerleaders.\n\nRugbyfromawheelchair spoke to Tarryn and Sotira to find out all about being a Bulls Babe.\n\nRFAW: Hi girls, let’s start off by finding out how old you are?\n\nTarryn: I’m 19, born in 1994, the year of South African democracy.\n\nSotira: I’m 22.\n\nRFAW: How long have you been a Bulls Babe?\n\nTarryn: I joined the Bulls Babes in June 2012 but my first official performance was on the 23rd of February 2013 (Bulls vs Stormers).\n\nSotira: I’ve been dancing for the Bulls Babes for just over a year.\n\nRFAW: Both of you are studying towards degrees, is it difficult juggling your studying and dancing commitments?\n\nTarryn: I have always had a balanced life throughout my school career juggling academics, sports and dance which has helped me with my present commitments.\n\nSotira: It was difficult in the beginning but if you are passionate and determined then it is easy to find a balance.\n\nRFAW: Sotira, how does one become a Bulls Babe?\n\nSotira: Nicola [Brosnihan] holds auditions once a year. The dancer needs to have a couple of years experience before you audition in any genre of dance.\n\nRFAW: Tarryn, what exactly happens on match days?\n\nTarryn: On match days the first thing we do is get treated by our hairdressing sponsor Thomas Jewel Hairdressing to help us look our best. We are then scheduled to meet at Loftus two hours before the match. Once in our change room we touch up our makeup and listen to music to help us get into the zone.\n\nWe all interact with each other. An hour before the game, we change into our match day outfits, stretch and go through our routines. But most important we say a little prayer before we run out onto the field.\n\nRFAW: How often do you girls train?\n\nSotira: We train on Wednesdays for three hours, both in the studio and on the field. If we need extra practice or are preparing for a new gig then Nicola will tell us.\n\nRFAW: What do you mean by gig?\n\nSotira: As Bulls Babes, we don’t just dance at games but also at golf days, charity events and for our sponsors Vodacom and Puma.\n\nRFAW: Sotira, what are the perks of being a Bulls Babe?\n\nSotira: The biggest perk is being apart of a family. Nicola is our inspiration and the female equivalent of Pierre [Spies]. The girls are fabulous and I feel at home with the girls.\n\nRFAW: Taryn, do you get paid for your dancing?\n\nTarryn: Yes, we are privileged to get paid for doing something we love but we are also involved in many charity events in our attempt to make everyday a Mandela Day.\n\nRFAW: What are your best memories of being a Bulls Babe?\n\nTarryn: I enjoy being out there on the field and experiencing the vibe of the crowd.\n\nMy best memory in particular is the jump that Bulletjie and I have started. The enthusiasm from the crowd makes jumping into the arms of the Bulls Mascot’s arms worthwhile.\n\nSotira: I have to say my first game. The Loftus crowd are just phenomenal.\n\nRFAW: Any words of encouragement for aspiring dancers?\n\nTarryn: “Dancing with your feet is one thing but dancing with your heart is another.\n\nLike in life, you should always give your best because if dancing is your passion than it is easy to become a success! Anything is possible, if you can move then you can dance.\n\nSotira: Get into the studio everyday. If there’s something you can’t do, persevere. Don’t give up on something you love!\n\nThank you Tarryn and Sotira for allowing us to see the inside happenings of being a Bulls Babe.\n\n“Rugby & more”\n\nThe South African Rugby Union (SARU) on Wednesday named sports performance brand ASICS as the new apparel sponsor of the Springboks and their associated national teams.\n\nThe six-year deal runs from 1 January 2014 to 31 December 2019, taking in the Rugby World Cups of England 2015 and Japan – the birthplace of ASICS – in 2019.\n\nAs well as providing kit to the Springboks, ASICS will supply kit and apparel to their associated national teams – including the women’s and all age-group teams, as well as SARU referees.\n\n“This deal with leading sports performance brand ASICS is a huge coup for SARU, and one we’re very excited about,” said Jurie Roux, SARU CEO. “We are entering an enormously important period for South African rugby, encompassing two Rugby World Cups, as well as a new Springbok era under coach Heyneke Meyer. ASICS’ high level technical apparel and global brand reputation will help us both on and off the field.\n\n“Making use of local manufacturers was one of the criteria in the tendering process and we have been impressed in the way ASICS has approached this. Their team has already held a number of discussions with potential suppliers around the country.”\n\nASICS will provide SARU with the highest level technical apparel, benefitting from the expertise gained by research at the company’s Institute of Sport Science and provide specific technologies to improve performance, through posture management and muscle support.\n\nThe new apparel will include compression fabrics to improve blood circulation, high-tech laser cut ventilation, ergonomic design and recycled materials.\n\nAlistair Cameron, President and CEO of ASICS EMEA, said: “ASICS has a long and proud tradition of partnering with athletes, teams and federations and we are extremely excited about expanding our cutting edge performance products into the rugby market and in particular working alongside one of the leading partners in that market – the South African Rugby Union.\n\n“With South Africa providing huge growth potential, ASICS’ partnership with SARU is a chance for us to continue to build our brand awareness and positioning in the South African market, whilst also supporting the Springboks in their quest to become the number one rugby side in the world.”\n\nRoux said the new ASICS designed playing apparel would only be revealed later in the year. It will make its first appearance in action in next year’s HSBC World Sevens Series event in the USA in January.\n\nASICS EMEA currently sponsor a range of teams and athletes, including the athletics federations of France, Italy, Netherlands, Australia and Japan as well as Cricket Australia, and leading athletes such as Gael Monfils (tennis), Sam Stosur (Tennis), Christophe LeMaitre (athletics), Jan Frodeno (Triathlon) and Helen Jenkins (Triathlon).\n\n“Rugby & more”\n\nSpringbok Women’s caretaker coach Aslam Abrahams on Wednesday announced a talented 28-member squad for their Rugby World Cup qualifier against Uganda at the Buffalo City Stadium in East London on September 7.\n\nA victory for the Springbok Women would secure their place in next year’s IRB Rugby World Cup in France, while a defeat would dash their hopes of participating in the international spectacle.\n\nThe squad features 17 players who participated in the recent Women’s Nations Cup in Colorado, including captain Mandisa Williams and play-makers Zenay Jordaan and Veroeshka Grain, and three SA under-20 players who took part in their Nations Cup tournament in London.\n\nA handful of the ladies also participated in the Rugby World Cup Sevens in Russia in June. This includes star player Natasha Hofmeester who makes a welcome return to the squad after work commitments ruled her out of the Senior Nations Cup.\n\nBorder centre Ziyanda Tywaleni and Sharks lock Dolly Mavumengwana, who boast vast experience, have also been included in the squad.\n\nIn line with Abrahams’ plan to expand his pool of players, the squad includes a few new faces, with Jacqueline Kriel (Blue Bulls), Nombasa Nagile, Asithandile Ntoyanto, Sinazo Tsawu (Border) and Nomsa Mokwai (Leopards) earning call-ups. Should they secure places in the match-day squad and take to the field, they will make their Test debuts.\n\nThe squad will gather in East London on Sunday to begin their preparations for the clash, and will remain in camp until September 8.\n\nAbrahams was delighted with the quality of his squad and he hoped that the experience the players’ gained at the Nations Cup tournaments would count in the team’s favour.\n\n“We have selected the best possible squad for the World Cup qualifier,” said the coach. “Most of the players boast invaluable international experience, and many of these ladies have played together before, so they know each other well. This will be vital to perform to our potential. But that said it is always nice to see new faces in the squad, so hopefully the new players will learn from some of the veterans in the group.”\n\nAbrahams was under no illusions about the hard work ahead, especially given the high stakes in the clash, but he hoped it would inspire the players to put their bodies on the line and make the country proud.\n\n“The fact that a Rugby World Cup place is at stake is massive motivation, so the ladies know they will have to give their all next week to achieve our goal of participating in the showpiece,” said Abrahams. “Fortunately we saw first-hand what our shortcomings were at the Nations Cup, so we have an idea of the areas we need to improve on going into the clash.”\n\nWomen’s squad for Rugby World Cup qualifier:\n\nNolusindiso Booi (Border)\n\nMarlien Cronje (Blue Bulls)\n\nNomathamsanqa Faleni (Eastern Province)\n\nVeroeshka Grain (Western Province)\n\nNatasha Hofmeester (Western Province)\n\nLaurian Johannes (Western Province)\n\nZenay Jordaan (Eastern Province)\n\nTayla Kinsey (Sharks)\n\nJacqueline Kriel (Blue Bulls)\n\nThantaswa Macingwana (Border)\n\nDolly Mavumengwana (Sharks)\n\nAndrea Mentoor (Western Province)\n\nNomsa Mokwai (Leopards)\n\nLamla Momoti (Border)\n\nZintle Mpupha (Border)\n\nNombasa Nagile (Border)\n\nNwabisa Ngxatu (Border)\n\nZandile Nojoko (Eastern Province)\n\nAsithandile Ntoyanto (Border)\n\nFundiswa Plaatjie (Border)\n\nMarnezelle Rabie (SWD)\n\nDaphne Scheepers (Eastern Province)\n\nMathrin Simmers (SWD)\n\nSinazo Tsawu (Border)\n\nZiyanda Tywaleni (Border)\n\nVuyolwethu Vazi (Blue Bulls)\n\nMandisa Williams (Border)\n\nThandi Xwetu (Blue Bulls)\n\nManagement Team:\n\nAslam Abrahams – Head Coach\n\nGerhard Oelofse – Assistant Coach (Forwards)\n\nOrna Prinsloo – Team Manager\n\nLehlogonolo Mampane – Team Doctor Denzil van Heerden – Fitness Coach\n\nTanushree Pillay – Physiotherapist\n\n“Rugby & more”\n\nZane Kirchner and Chiliboy Ralepelle have been selected to travel with the Springboks to Australia and New Zealand for the next two Tests in The Castle Lager Rugby Championship.\n\nThe squad of 26 players who returned from Argentina on Monday was retained, with Kirchner (fullback) and Ralepelle (hooker) the only additions.\n\nRalepelle, the third hooker in the squad, missed the Argentinean tour because of a back injury and will have to pass a fitness test before he can board the plane to Australia. A final call on his availability will be made by Friday.\n\nThe Springbok squad of 28 players will depart for Brisbane via Sydney on Saturday afternoon for their Tests against Australia in the Queensland capital on 7 September and New Zealand in Auckland on 14 September.\n\n“This will be two tough weeks on the road against two of the best sides in the world and as we saw last weekend against Argentina, we still have a lot of hard work to do,” said Springbok coach Heyneke Meyer.\n\n“The Springboks have never beaten Australia at Suncorp Stadium in Brisbane and our last victory at Eden Park was in 1937.\n\n“Australia may have lost their first two matches of The Castle Lager Rugby, but they showed a marked improvement last weekend in Wellington.\n\n“They are always a tough opponent at home – the Springboks’ last victory over there was in 2009 and we’ve only won three out of 18 matches in this competition in Australia.\n\n“We get together on Thursday and will have to put in a lot of hard work in the next 10 days. We let ourselves down in certain areas of the game in Mendoza and will have to fix those if we are going to be competitive against Australia.”\n\nThe 28-man Springbok squad to Australia and New Zealand:\n\nForwards (16): Lourens Adriaanse, Willem Alberts, Marcell Coetzee, Bismarck du Plessis, Jannie du Plessis, Eben Etzebeth, Siya Kolisi, Juandré Kruger, Francois Louw, Tendai Mtawarira, Coenie Oosthuizen, Chiliboy Ralepelle, Gurthrö Steenkamp, Adriaan Strauss, Flip van der Merwe, Duane Vermeulen.\n\nBacks (12): Bjorn Basson, Jean de Villiers (captain), JJ Engelbrecht, Bryan Habana, Zane Kirchner, Patrick Lambie, Willie le Roux, Ruan Pienaar, Jan Serfontein, Morné Steyn, Piet van Zyl, Jano Vermaak.\n\n“Rugby & more”\n\nThe Leopards this past weekend succeed in their mission to reduce the gap between themselves, the Sharks and MTN Golden Lions on the Absa Under-19 Provincial Championship log as they delivered a fine performance to topple Toyota Free State.\n\nThe bonus-point victory allowed them to match the third-placed Sharks on the log with 18 points, while they now trail the second-placed MTN Golden Lions by only six points. This means they could work their way into contention for a home semifinal if they build on this form in the next few weeks.\n\nIn the weekend’s matches the MTN Golden Lions defeated DHL Western Province 31-26 in Johannesburg, the Leopards beat Toyota Free State 34-16 in Bloemfontein and the Vodacom Blue Bulls stretched their winning streak to six matches by beating the Sharks 28-19 in Durban.\n\nMTN Golden Lions 31 (24) DHL Western Province 26 (11)\n\nAt Ellis Park the MTN Golden Lions played their way into a convincing 24-11 half time lead against DHL Western Province with a fine display of attacking rugby. No8 Jano Venter crashed over the tryline for the team’s first five-pointer in the 13th minute after a few tight exchanges, but Western Province flyhalf Christopher Smith hit back two minutes later. The Lions, however, made the most of their opportunities as the half progressed, which earned them two more tries by Koch Marx and Carlisle Nel.\n\nThe second half proved to be much tighter, as the visitors stamped their authority, resulting in a thrilling half. Western Province had the first say as Pieter Schoonraad scored their second try early on, but the Lions cancelled it out as Nel scored his second minutes later. This try also secured the team’s bonus point. WP fought back and earned the rewards with Sebastian Ferreira crossing the tryline late in the game, but the Lions’ first half lead proved to be enough to secure the victory.\n\nScorers:\n\nMTN Golden Lions 31 (24) – Tries: Carlisle Nel (2), Jano Venter, Koch Marx. Conversions: Brandan Hewit (4). Penalty: Brandan Hewit.\n\nWestern Province 26 (11) – Tries: Christopher Smith, Pieter Schoonraad, Sebastian Ferreira. Conversion: Christopher Smith. Penalty: Christopher Smith (3).\n\nToyota Free State 16 (9) Leopards 34 (12)\n\nIn Bloemfontein the Leopards produced a spectacular second-half display to outclass the Toyota Free State and secure their fourth bonus point for tries in six outings. The first half was a hard fought as the teams threw everything at each other, with the Leopards scoring two tries while Free State wing Stephen Rautenbach kicked three penalties for a 12-9 half time score.\n\nThe home team came out strongly after the break and took the lead with Jan Venter scoring a try. But the flood gates opened for the Leopards in the last 20 minutes as they controlled proceedings and made the most of their try-scoring chances. This earned them three more tries, for a total of five, which pushed the match out of reach for the Free State.\n\nScorers:\n\nToyota Free State 16 (9) – Try: Jan Venter. Conversion: Stephen Rautenbach. Penalties: Stephen Rautenbach (3).\n\nLeopards 34 (12) – Tries: Blessing Makhayhu, Jeandre Rudolph, Kwena Moremi, Lourens Boddington (2). Conversions: Cornelius Swart, Janko Barnard (2). Drop Goal: Barnard.\n\nThe Sharks 19 (13) Vodacom Blue Bulls 28 (13)\n\nThe clash in Durban was thrilling from the outset as the Sharks and Vodacom Blue Bulls gave their all, resulting in a tightly-fought first half. So closely matched were the teams they each earned two penalties and a converted try to enter the break at 13-13.\n\nTwo more penalties by Sharks flyhalf Jean-Luc du Preez handed the home team the lead a few minutes into the second half. But this proved the be the side’s last points, as the Blue Bulls found their form and began to take advantage of the holes in the defence. With their attack functioning well, props Wilco Louw and Pierre Schoeman dotted down. Another penalty by flyhalf Kobus Marais allowed them to stretch their unbeaten run in the series to six matches.\n\nScorers:\n\nThe Sharks 19 (13) – Try: Barend Potgieter. Conversion: Jean-Luc du Plessis. Penalties: Du Plessis (4).\n\nVodacom Blue Bulls 28 (13) – Tries: Keagon Gordon, Pierre Schoeman, Wilco Louw. Conversions: Kobus Marais (2). Penalties: Kobus Marais (3).\n\n“Rugby & more”\n\nDHL Western Province were rewarded for their consistency in the Absa Under-21 Provincial Championship this past weekend as they climbed to the top of the log table and gained a valuable four-point lead over the chasing teams.\n\nVictories for Toyota Free State and the Sharks also allowed them to close the gap between themselves and the Vodacom Blue Bulls, resulting in only one point separating the second-placed Pretoria side and fourth-placed Free State.\n\nIn an exciting round of matches DHL Western Province thumped the MTN Golden Lions 53-26 at Ellis Park, Toyota Free State defeated the Leopards 40-29 in Bloemfontein and the Sharks registered a narrow 19-15 victory against the Vodacom Blue Bulls in Durban.\n\nMTN Golden Lions 26 (14) DHL Western Province 53 (27)\n\nAt Ellis Park the MTN Golden Lions put up a brave fight against DHL Western Province in the first half as they scored two tries to the visitors’ three. Penalties at crucial times allowed WP flyhalf Dillyn Leyds to nudge his team ahead on the scoreboard, which left the Lions with a lot of work to do in the second half.\n\nWestern Province continued their impressive form in the second half though as they ran in another two tries for their bonus point. The Lions held on and also secured their bonus point try before the visitors ran away with the game in the last 10 minutes. Justin Benn and Frederik Nel crossed the tryline to take their try tally for the match to seven. Leyds’ influence was particularly impressive with the player dictating play well and contributing 16 points with the boot.\n\nScorers:\n\nMTN Golden Lions 26 (14) – Tries: Albertus Smith, Devon Martinus, Jacques Nel (2). Conversions: Marais Schmidt (3).\n\nDHL Western Province 53 (27) – Tries: Frederik Nel, Joshua Katzen, Justin Benn, Kobus van Wyk, Kyle Lombard (2), Oliver Kebble. Conversions: Dillyn Leyds (6). Penalties: Leyds (2).\n\nToyota Free State 40 (30) Leopards 29 (10)\n\nIn Bloemfontein a strong first-half performance set the Toyota Free State up for their fourth victory of the season. So dominant was the Bloemfontein side, they scored four tries in 25 minutes to add to two early penalties by fullback Marco Mason and to take a convincing 30-10 lead at the break.\n\nHowever, the balance of power shifted in the second half as the Leopards tightened up their defence and stepped up their urgency on attack, which limited the Free State to only 10 points in the half. The Leopards, meanwhile, crossed the chalk three times in the last 23 minutes to secure their bonus point try. Unfortunately for the visitors their efforts were not enough to undo the damage in the first half.\n\nScorers:\n\nToyota Free State 40 (30) – Tries: Henco Greyling (2), Maputha Dolo (2), Sethu Tom, Stephen Griesel. Conversions: Marco Mason (2). Penalties: Marco Mason (2).\n\nLeopards 29 (10) – Tries: Jaco Buys (2), Ryno Smith, Warren Gilbert. Conversions: Warren Gilbert (3). Penalty: Gilbert.\n\nThe Sharks 19 (6) Vodacom Blue Bulls 15 (15)\n\nIn Durban the Sharks overturned a 15-6 half-time deficit to cause an upset against the Vodacom Blue Bulls. The clash started off tightly with the teams exchanging penalties as they both battled to breach the defence. The Bulls, however, capitalised on two try-scoring chances late in the half, which handed them the lead going into the break.\n\nThe Sharks fought back strongly by producing quality performances on attack and defence to take charge of the match. This earned them two tries by Kotaro Matsushima and Stefan Ungerer, while Robert du Preez slotted over his third penalty to seal the victory.\n\nScorers:\n\nThe Sharks 19 (6) – Tries: Kotaro Matsushima, Stefan Ungerer. Penalties: Robert du Preez (3).\n\nVodacom Blue Bulls 15 (15) – Tries: Dries Swanepoel, Jermaine Kleinsmith. Conversion: Handrè Pollard. Penalty: Handrè Pollard.\n\n“Rugby & more”"
