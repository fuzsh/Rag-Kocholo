DAN LOMBARD

FNB UP-Tuks travel to Bloemfontein today to play FNB UFS-Shimlas. They will be looking to build on last week’s 24-8 win against UCT.

The Bloemfontein team will be hoping to fix their mistakes after they suffered a 15-23 home defeat at the hands of FNB Maties while Tuks will want to gather momentum as the competition enters the halfway mark.

Head coach Nollis Marais has shuffled his team around both in the starting lineup and amongst the replacements. Vainon Willis, who injured his hamstring against UCT, is replaced by Riaan Britz. On the bench, prop Sabelo Nhlapo and hooker Mbongeni Mbonambi replace Juan Schoeman and Jaco Visagie. Clayton Stewart a Varsity Cup veteran who has played in four campaigns, replaces Danie Faasen as the reserve scrumhalf with debutant Piet Lindeque coming in as a replacement utility back.

Winning this game will put Tuks in good stead for their clash against Maties in a fortnight’s time.

FNB UP-Tuks Team: 15 Clayton Blommetjies, 14 Riaan Britz, 13 William Small-Smith, 12 Christopher Bosch, 11 Courtnall Skosan, 10 Tian Schoeman, 9 Lohan Jacobs, 8 Jean Cook, 7 Wiaan Liebenberg (captain), 6 Shaun Adendorff, 5 Marvin Orie, 4 Mike Williams, 3 Hencus Van Wyk, 2 Mbongeni Mbonambi, 1 Sabelo Nhlapo.
