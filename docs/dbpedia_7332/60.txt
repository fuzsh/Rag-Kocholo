Sharks back Piet Lindeque has agreed a deal to return to the Free State, his agent has confirmed.

Lindeque began his career in Bloemfontein, having been schooled at Grey College. He then moved to Durban and after turning out for the Sharks at age group and Vodacom Cup level enjoyed a brief stint with the Bulls at the beginning of the current season before returning to the Sharks where he has turned out in five Super Rugby matches.

Despite his recent rise up the ranks, the 22-year-old has decided it is best to try his hand with the Cheetahs, with his move to go through before the Currie Cup.

“Piet is ecstatic to return to the Free State,” said his agent, Jan-Harm van Wyk, is quoted as saying by Volksblad.

“It's a positive move for his career and I know he enjoys the Cheetahs' playing style… he believes it will enhance his game.”
