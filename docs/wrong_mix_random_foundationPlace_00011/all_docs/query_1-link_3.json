        "text": "Actress Manisha Koirala has got candid about her personal life ahead of the release of her highly anticipated web series ‘Heeramandi: The Diamond Bazaar’, which marks the directorial debut of Sanjay Leela Bhansali on OTT. Manisha, who has been a fiercely private person, spoke at length about going through several “ups and downs” in her life including her divorce with Nepali businessman, Samrat Dahal, and cancer diagnosis.\n\nSharing how she stayed strong through her divorce and battle with cancer, Manisha told Zoom, “Some people are lucky who don’t get so many highs and so many lows and have a very peaceful life. I’m also lucky that I’ve had a huge amalgamation of experiences. All I can do is hope that at least my outlook on life is not bitter. My work is on that. My work is what I can change and how I see life, like whether I see a glass half empty or half full. Do I perceive life to be traumatic? No. Whenever traumatic experiences happen, don’t I learn more about life? Don’t I become richer in terms of experiences, in terms of first-hand experience of such huge trauma?”\n\nShe further acknowledged her vulnerabilities and said, “I get anxiety attacks, and I do get insecure. I have all those things that everyone has. I also feel depressed and sad many times. But I say, No, Manisha, get up; it’s time for a walk. I feel that once you go through so much, you also realise that there’s another side to it. You can pick yourself up and walk. They say that life is not about falling but about picking yourself up after every fall and walking. That’s the motto I live by.”\n\nWhen asked about whether she is open to finding love again or desires a life partner, she said, “I do. I’ll be lying if I say I don’t. I definitely feel as if there was a male figure in my life. If there was a partner in my life, Probably, it’ll be nice to have that. But I have to be very honest: main uske liye intezaar karke apna time waste nahi karungi (I won’t waste my time waiting for that person). Agar mere kismat mein likhi hai (if it’s in my destiny), then I’ll get that. Agar nahi hai, toh bhi thik hai. Mujhe lagta hai, I’m living a full life.”"
