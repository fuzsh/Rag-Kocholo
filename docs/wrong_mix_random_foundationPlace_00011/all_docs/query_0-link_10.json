        "text": "Macbeth Massacre\n\nA play by Shakespeare\n\nSomething wicked this way comes…\n\nMacbeth Massacre brought the excitement and power of two great works of art in a fusion of theatre and opera, created and directed by OWT Artistic Director Deborah Merola and Music Director Jonathan Khuner of the San Francisco Opera and the Metropolitan Opera. Lead actors Rajkumar Pudasaini as Macbeth and Andi Davis as Lady Macbeth with a cast and crew of 69 Nepali and international artists, joined by the visiting renowned opera performers Roy Stevens, Annalisa Winberg and Jillian Khuner. Shakespeare’s immortal verse blends with sections in Nepali, and the Italian libretto and music by Verdi, in this polyphonic work of sweeping grandeur and piercing insight.\n\nDIRECTOR'S NOTE: DEBORAH MEROLA\n\nWhat happiness to come full circle and welcome back the wonderful opera friends from the USA, who helped us create the 2016 fusion opera Arjuna’s Dilemma, now for an equally challenging and exciting fusion of Shakespeare’s drama and Verdi’s opera in Macbeth Massacre. Returning to Nepal are maestro Jonathan Khuner, the sung Macbeths Roy Stevens and Annalisa Winberg, scenographer Greg Mitchell, and sound designer Lucky Peckham.\n\nAgain, we collaborate with local artists and expats, including instrumentalists from the Kathmandu Jazz Conservatory and community singers, plus youth from The British School. Our large cast and production group is also international, with our marvelous Shakespeare Lady Macbeth Andi Davis travelling from California, along with soloist Jillian Khuner, and actor Caroline Hodson—all three in Nepal for the first time.\n\nHowever, true to One World Theatre’s mission, we predominantly feature Nepali artists, here providing employment and training to over 30 individuals, several in both acting and production roles. While I was cautioned that Shakespeare could not be credibly performed in English in Nepal, I hope you will find my trust in our brilliant and devoted Nepali actors vindicated, with uniformly fine performances and some that could rival Shakespeare performed on any stage.\n\nWith special thanks to Rajkumar Pudasaini who worked for months on the Shakespearean English for a role that predominates in the play, helped especially by his Lady Macbeth Andi Davis. When I see this very large group of young, adult, community and professional, Nepali and international artists working respectfully, creatively and joyfully together, I feel too that my choice to devote the last thirty years of my life to theatre in Nepal and One World Theatre, has been the best choice I ever could have made.\n\nI am in your debt. Deborah\n\nNOTE FROM MUSIC DIRECTOR: JONATHAN KHUNER\n\nGiuseppe Verdi with his librettist Francisco Maria Piave did their best to extract the most powerful scenes and portray the deepest emotions of Macbeth within the constraints of 19th-century Italian Opera. Verdi's style of presentation in 1845 differs radically from Elizabethan theatre of 1605. Instead of the continuous chain of short scenes which makes Shakespeare so intense, Verdi’s operas feature melodic plot-moving sections, alternating with expansive song-like reflections on dramatic moments, when the action stops and the characters voice their feelings in song-like numbers (arias, duets, large ensembles).\n\nOperatic vocalization is quite different from spoken theater, the sense of time in opera is greatly expanded, and the amount of text used is considerably less. As a consequence, there are fascinating, major challenges to fusing the great strength of these two masterpieces, each in its own characteristic language and form.\n\nWe hope that our original melding of distinct genres on the same overwhelming story will bring forth rich interplay, hidden aspects, and a distinctly powerful experience. As a conductor, I have found the process uniquely rewarding despite its distinctive difficulties.\n\nScenographer Greg Mitchell, designer for Arjuna’s Dilemma and The Flight, uses powerful shadows on the colour saturated blue, sienna and blood red walls, torn open by bombardments. The costumes by Aagya Khanal integrate high-concept fashion designs with a timeless haunted quality. The small orchestra includes accomplished musicians from the Kathmandu Jazz Conservatory and a Verdi chorus with professional opera and local a capella ensemble Ananda.\n\nAlso part of the production team are production manager Amrit Dahal, assistant director Rose Schwietz, stage manager Manish Byanju, sound designer Lucy Peckham, scenographer Greg Mitchell, props by Suryaman Limbu, choreography by Alize Biannic, masks by Kripa Khadgi and costumes by Aagya Khanal.\n\nThe audience is confronted with sounds of distant artillery and a set based on a recent photograph of an inferno in an Iranian prison. The operatic Lady Macbeth and Macbeth appear from the recesses and trail surreal elements from the 19th-century Kot Massacre. The Witches rise out of the battlefield mist and mounds of beaten earth, their bodies contorting and expanding like the yarn of fates unfurling. Lady Macbeth washes and wrings her bloody hands and Macbeth seems to wade through blood, with evocative lines and images projected upon the ruin, “What bloody man is this?” and “What are you afraid of?”\n\nMacbeth Massacre pushes the boundaries of One World Theatre’s repertoire while keeping our commitment to outstanding acting and innovative production design. In addition to featuring a cast and production team of primarily Nepali artists, the immersive adaptation addresses Nepal’s own historic trials and tribulations, power struggles and court intrigues – much of which is now gradually disappearing from collective memory – by way of Shakespeare and Verdi.\n\nNOTES\n\nThis 2h45 old English-language play with an intermission features sections from Guissepi Verdi’s Italian opera and several sections spoken in Nepali.\n\nTrigger warning: the play features loud rifle reports, secual innuendo, staged violence, including the murder of a young boy, as well as references to suicide.\n\nTickets for the show can be purchased through Mandala Theatre here or booked by phone 01-5245147.\n\nPatron seats (extra legroom): 1.000NPR\n\nStandards seats: 500NPR\n\nStudents (max. 50 per show): 300NPR\n\nPerformances:\n\nFri. 19 May at 5.30\n\nSat. 20 May at 5.30\n\nSun. 21 May at 5.30\n\nMon. 22 May: no show\n\nTue. 23 May at 1.30 private student show with British School\n\nTue. 23 May at 5.30\n\nWed. 24 May: 11.30 private student show with NCCS\n\nWed. 24 May at 5.30: No show\n\nThu. 25 May at 5.30\n\nFri. 26 May at 5.30\n\nSat. 27 May at 12.30\n\nSat. 27 May at 5.30\n\nSun. 28 May at 5.30\n\nMUSIC\n\nShakespeare’s Scottish play predominates in the first part of the performance when the triumphant Generals Macbeth and Banquo are greeted by the prophetic witches, choreographed by Alize Biannic who also appears as Hecate. At the fateful entrance of King Duncan to Inverness Castle, the Verdi singers of Macbeth and Lady Macbeth begin to stir and descend from the dusty upper reaches of the castle ruin. These Royal Ghosts start to overtake and blend with the actions and conscience of Macbeth and Lady Macbeth and enact bloody massacre, like a reoccurring curse, a national memory or a rising blood lust.\n\nSoon the opera singers join the ghosts of the murdered King Duncan and Banquo to haunt Macbeth’s banquet, and follow the downward spiral of the Macbeth and Lady Macbeth into sleeplessness and madness. Macbeth only courageously rouses himself when Malcom, son of King Duncan, and his army advance on the castle carrying branches, again enveloping the audience in a modern and mythic battlefield.\n\nIn an exciting musical juxtaposition, the basic Verdi score is played at the keyboard by the brilliant Jonathan Khuner, with other instrumentalists joining in quasi-improvisatorially on both western and eastern instruments. The Shakespeare is lightly underscored in a more improvised fashion, and with more reliance on eastern instruments, while the Verdi sections are performed with keyboard accompaniment rather strictly as composed, and western classical instruments adding to the harmonic and melodic givens. Some sections, delivered in Nepali, are repetitions of material first set forth in English and particularly powerful accompanied by Eastern or amalgamated music, and more highlighted interpretive dance. Music piped in from other directions echoes through the halls.\n\nRELEVANCE\n\nBelief in witchcraft, overweening ambition, and the murder of kings in the earlier Rana era and the Palace Massacre in 2001 are themes that will resonate in Nepal, costumes mixed with modern Nepali dress: women in sari, and the men in Army uniforms. For contemporary America, magical thinking, conspiracy theories, and a President who some fear would be King can strike a chord. In both countries, the haunting memory of civil war, assassination and murder can strike fear. However, both the transcendent dramatic text and operatic score circle into a great moral center that ultimately is reassuring about the cost of evil and the triumph of good.\n\nPLOT SUMMARY\n\nThree witches anticipate a meeting with Macbeth. King Duncan hears a report of how his generals Macbeth and Banquo defeated the Norwegians and the Scottish rebels. The witches gather on a heath and meet the generals returning from the war. They predict Macbeth will become Thane of Cawdor, and one day king, and that Banquo will be the father of kings. Macbeth is then greatly impressed when he is greeted by Ross and Angus with the title of Cawdor.\n\nDuncan greets Macbeth with great praise and proposes to visit him. Macbeth writes to his wife telling her of what has happened and the King’s plans. Lady Macbeth, seeing the opportunity, plots with her husband how they might kill Duncan when he arrives. After initial enthusiasm, Macbeth changes his mind, but Lady Macbeth persuades him to carry out the deed. He murders Duncan, making it seem that the servants were to blame and describes the scene to his wife. She finds herself having to return the daggers he has used to Duncan’s bedroom, and her hands become covered with blood too. They retire when they hear repeated knocking at the castle gates.\n\nMacduff and Lennox arrive, and have a brief exchange with the Porter. Macduff discovers the dead king and rouses the castle. Malcolm and Donalbain, fearing blame for their father’s death, flee abroad. Soon after, Ross and Macduff reflect on what has happened, and Macduff reports that Macbeth has been made king.\n\nMacbeth is concerned about his position, very aware of the prophecies about Banquo. He arranges with a group of murderers to kill Banquo and his son Fleance; they succeed with Banquo, but Fleance escapes. At a dinner that night, where Banquo would have been the chief guest, Macbeth is terrified by the appearance of his ghost. Macbeth decides to return to the witches to find out his fate. They tell him that he should fear Macduff, that no man born of woman can hurt Macbeth, and that he will never be vanquished until Birnam Wood comes to Dunsinane. They then show apparitions making predictions.\n\nMacbeth learns that Macduff is fled to England, so he arranges the death of Macduff’s wife and children. Macduff meets Malcolm, who tests Macduff’s allegiance to Scotland by first painting a bleak picture of his own personality as a future king, then revealing his true character. They agree to fight together, with English support. During the meeting, Ross brings news of the murder of Macduff’s family. In Scotland, a doctor and gentlewoman observe Lady Macbeth sleepwalking, imagining she cannot clean her hands of Duncan’s blood.\n\nThe Scottish nobles gather, and Malcolm orders his men to camouflage themselves with tree branches as they attack, thus giving the appearance of Birnam Wood approaching Dunsinane. Macbeth learns his wife has died. Fearing no man born of woman, Macbeth fights on, killing Young Seyward, but on meeting Macduff he learns of Macduff’s caesarian birth. Macbeth refuses to yield, is killed by Macduff, and Malcolm is proclaimed king.\n\nA more detailed scene overview to better understand and follow the play can be found here.\n\nFor educators:\n\nTwinkl: https://www.twinkl.com/resources/ks2-story-book-resources/ks2-stories-shakespeare/ks2-stories-shakespeare-macbeth\n\nBritish Council Kids summary of Macbeth: https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=Oo9vPZczdbQ\n\nBritish council teen summary: https://learnenglishteens.britishcouncil.org/study-break/video-series/shakespeare/shakespeare-macbeth\n\nSummary of Macbeth: https://www.shakespeare.org.uk/explore-shakespeare/shakespedia/shakespeares-plays/macbeth/\n\nHow to teach Shakespeare to ESL students: https://www.britishcouncil.org/voices-magazine/how-make-shakespeare-easy-english-language-learners\n\nWant to know more about Shakespeare himself? https://www.shakespeare.org.uk/explore-shakespeare/shakespedia/william-shakespeare/william-shakespeare-biography\n\nJournalists can access photos, interviews with cast and production members here.\n\nPRODUCTION TEAM\n\nCreated and directed by OWT Artistic Director Deborah Merola and Music Director/Music Arranger Jonathan Khuner of the San Francisco Opera and the Metropolitan Opera, Macbeth Massacre will feature stage actor Rajkumar Pudasaini in the dramatic role of Macbeth and Andi Davis as Lady macBeth, as well as in very special cameos, the international opera performers Roy Stevens, Annalisa Winberg and Jillian Khuner appear in sung roles for respectively MacBeth, Lady MacBeth and Lady MacDuff, supported by celebrated OWT Company Actors, the Kathmandu Chorale and local a capella group Ananda, as well as a Youth Ensemble with students from the British School.\n\nDEBORAH MEROLA, Macbeth Massacre Director, is a Ph.D. in Dramatic Arts from the University of California at Berkeley, a 2003 and 2011 Senior Fulbright in Theatre in Nepal, and the Founding Artistic Director of One World Theatre.
