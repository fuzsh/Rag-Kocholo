Khadka said corruption was widespread, for the lack of implementation of laws that were enacted to stem corruption.Â â€œFight against corruption is the major challenge of the country right now,â€ he said.\n\nAnybody who give information on King Birendra’s property to get reward\n\nDec 12, 2011 @ 17:08\n\nThe Nepal Trust which was founded on November 22, 2007, has announced rewards for those giving information related to the movable and immovable property owned by late King Birendra and his family inside and outside the country.\n\nUnder-secretary of the Trust, Birendra Bahadur Baniya said the Trust has so far found records of 6,244 ropani of land owned by the late royal family members of which ownership of 1,179 ropani has already been transferred to the trust.\n\nLikewise, 44,116 pound sterling and around 120 million rupees has been deposited at the accounts of the Trust.\n\nMinistry sends case to police for missing NAC aircraft parts\n\nDec 14, 2011 @ 17:55\n\nThe Central Investigation Bureau (CIB) of the Nepal Police has been entrusted the responsibility of investigating a series of mysterious disappearances of aircraft parts belonging to Nepal Airlines Corporation (NAC) at the airport.\n\nLess than a year, equipment worth of Rs. 150 million has lost a fly away kit and spare wheels of its Boeing 757 and the landing gear of its Twin Otter aircraft.\n\nThe Ministry of Tourism and Civil Aviation (MoTCA) had requested the Home Ministry to conduct a probe after earlier investigations done by the ministry and the national flag carrier were fruitless.\n\nThe ministry’s move comes after the parliamentary Public Accounts Committee (PAC) directed it to take strong action against those involved in the thefts within seven days.\n\nCIB chief DIG Upendra Kant Aryal said the Police Headquarters had formally received the case file to investigate the thefts at NAC. â€œWe received the file on Sunday and the CIB is currently doing a study.â€\n\nWhile the MoTCA had formed a four-member high-level committee to look into the thefts, a ministry official said that they were a â€œcriminal caseâ€ rather than abuse of authority and thus a case for the Home Ministry.\n\nOn March 10, an investigation committee had been formed as per the directives of the MoTCA to probe the theft of a fly away kit of NAC’s Boeing 757. However, the probe team did not come up with anything, and unabashedly mentioned in its report that the staff on duty did not show up to answer questions. The fly away kit is estimated to cost around Rs 45 million.\n\nNAC had turned to the government for help after its probes turned up blank. â€œA big nexus within NAC is involved in these thefts, and the government should step in to investigate them,â€ NAC’s Executive Chairman Manarup Shahi told lawmakers at the PAC meeting on Nov 30.\n\nNC and PM meet inconclusive, Nepal Bandh on Monday\n\nDec 18, 2011 @ 16:53\n\nOrganizing a press conference at Nepali Congress (NC) president Sushil Koirala’s residence in Maharajgunj after the meeting with the prime minister Baburam Bhattarai, NC called upon all to support its protest programmes including Nepal bandh (nationwide general strike) that has been already announced for Monday.\n\nNC informed that the meeting with the prime minister ended inconclusively. The meeting was for consulting him before announcing the protest programmes. During the meeting, NC presented its four-point memorandum to PM Bhattarai over the death of Chitwan Tarun Dal chairman Shiva Paudel in an attack by inmates of Chitwan Jail on December 6.\n\nA group of inmates assaulted Paudel inside the district jail and died while undergoing treatment at Neuro hospital, Bansbari, Kathmandu on Saturday. He was detained at the jail for custodial remand for his alleged involvement in the murder of CPN-UML aligned Youth Association Nepal central member Sanjaya Lama.\n\nNC has termed the incident â€œpremeditatedâ€ and demanded immediate judicial investigation into it in the released statement. The NC has formed a five-member committee headed by Krishna Prasad Sitaula to look into the incident and has asked the government to declare Poudel a martyr and withdraw all impending charges against him.\n\nHowever, PM Bhattarai has requested to wait till the probe committee formed by the cabinet on Saturday evening comes up with its report on the incident. The cabinet also decided to provide Rs 1 million to the family of Paudel.\n\nFollowing Poudel’s death on Saturday, NC youth wing, Tarun Dal had staged protests nationwide calling bandh which was called off from 4 pm at the request of the NC leaders after the party called bandh for Monday.\n\nMeanwhile, on Sunday evening, supporting the protest programme, a torch rally was organized in Kathmandu.\n\nNC bandh concludes at 4 pm after crippling life nationwide\n\nDec 20, 2011 @ 02:23\n\nNepal bandh (general strike) called by main opposition Nepali Congress on Monday has affected normal life across the country for the whole day.

The Legislature-Parliament and the Cabinet had filed petitions on Monday at the apex court seeking provision for the term-extension of the CA one more time. Earlier on November 25, the Apex Court had directed the government to extend the CA term for one last time. The term was extended till May 30.\n\nSpeaking at an interaction in Kathmandu on Wednesday, UCPN (Maoist) politburo member and Prime Minister Baburam Bhattarai’s political advisor Devendra Poudel accused the judiciary of entering into politics by turning down the review petition.\n\nNepali Congress leader Ramesh Lekhak said the move of the judiciary invited complications as it undermined the rights of the parliament.\n\nAccording to CPN-UML leader Pradip Gyawali, the SC’s decision will invite proxy war between the judiciary and the parliament.\n\nMinister for Law and Justice Brijesh Kumar Gupta said that the apex court breached the principle of the separation of power. “Deciding the tenure of the CA does not fall within the SC’s jurisdiction and that by rejecting the review petition the court invited further controversyâ€, he added.\n\nGupta also said that the government is going to seek reconsideration over the SC’s rejection of the review petition.\n\nChild rapist gets 13-yr prison\n\nDec 29, 2011 @ 11:54\n\nDailekh District Court on Wednesday sentenced a man to 13 years in jail along with Rs 100,000 fine for raping a minor.\n\nA single bench of Justice Narayan Prasad Dhital convicted Keshav KC, of Kuikan Narayan Municipality-1, for the rape of a seven years old girl.\n\nAccording to locals, KC had taken the child to a nearby forest and raped her in August.\n\nTamu Lhosar being celebrated today\n\nDec 30, 2011 @ 14:36\n\nThe Gurung communities across the nation are celebrating Tamu Lhosar today. The Tamu Losar marks the beginning of the Tamu Sambat or Gurung Calendar Year.\n\nTamu Lhosar is celebrated on Poush 15 (mostly fall on 30th December) as per the lunar calendar by, Gurungs, who call themselves â€˜Tamu’. They are indigenous inhabitants of west-central parts of Nepal. Some also live east of Kathmandu. There are numerous clans of Gurung, the members of which are all well known for their valor, humor, singing and dancing skills.\n\nDuring Lhosar, the Gurung communities visit Buddhist shrines and exchange greetings with friends, relatives and well-wishers throughout the country. On this occasion, elders also offer blessings to their younger kin.\n\nVarious cultural programmes including rallies, sports and traditional dances are being organized to mark the day. These days, especially in major cities, Gurungs come together to celebrate Tamu Lhosar at a common place and rejoice in various cultural processions, feasting and merry-making. In the old days in the villages, they gathered in courtyards to celebrate Lhosar.\n\nOn the day of Tamu Lhosar, the government is providing a national holiday as it has been accepted as national festival since 2064.\n\nMeanwhile, President Ram Baran Yadav, Vice President Paramananda Jha and Prime Minister Baburam Bhattarai have sent out greeting messages on the occasion of Tamu Lhosar.

He stood first among all the winners of this year in the worldwide eco-hero competition in the age group 14 to 16 for initiating a project on â€˜Nationwide Signature Campaign on Climate Change’.\n\nÂ In the same competition, 15 years old Anup Chalise, Pokhara, stood third for planting sacred trees to protect the environment.\n\nAccording to information provided in the website, Action for Nature, a US-based non-profit organization has been recognizing innovative works of young people between the ages of 8 and 16 who have done creative environmental projects.\n\nTo make people in Nepal aware of issues related to global warming, Roshan created a club called JSA (Junior Social Awareness) that worked to obtain climate change petition signatures. He led a number of promotional campaigns that hosted guests like former Prime Minister Madhav Kumar Nepal, the Chief District Officer, and the Minister of the Environment of Nepal. President Ram Baran Yadav commenced his Nationwide Signature Campaign. Roshan approached many government officials and traveled all over Nepal to promote his campaign and hold press conferences.\n\nRoshan reached out to thousands of students and showed them how important global climate change is and found 75 student district representatives to collect signatures from their respective districts.\n\nRoshan said, he have been inspired to organize bigger programmes in the upcoming days in the field of climate change and other environmental issues and in future, he plans to start a tree-planting programme to mobilise youths to take action against global climate change.\n\nWhereas Anup used the Peepal tree (a sacred tree which is said to be the incarnation of the God Vishnu according to the Hindu religion), as a tool to explain global warming as religious, spiritual, or traditional language could be used to convey climate change information in a more productive way. This tree also has important environmental value. Anup began to collaborate with the Bandobasta organization, used his artwork and photography to enlist students to participate in the program and to teach youth in a practical way.\n\nAccording to Anup, at first the rural people did not want to give up their land for the trees to be planted, but they agreed when they realized the spiritual significance of the tree as well as its ecological value. His efforts have resulted in the planting of many Peepal trees."
