        "text": "During the current decade Nepal has experienced a complex political change process accompanied by disharmony, communal tension, and social mistrust. However, to date there has been no critical analysis of ethnicism and societal militarism and their effects on the political transformation process. Hence, this article examines the process of the emergence of exclusive ethnicism and societal militarism and their effects on Nepali society. The strategy of the Communist Party of Nepal Maoist to garner support of ethnic communities, and their tactics to mobilize the youth for electoral and political gain, were the main reasons for advancement of exclusive ethnicism and societal militarism in Nepal. If the current approach does not change it is highly likely that communal and ethnic violence will continue.\n\nThe issue of nationalism in Nepal has evolved significantly since 1990. Initially rooted in the nation-building process, it shifted focus after the end of the partyless Panchayati rule towards cultural nationalism. Nepal's diversity, including its geography, people, culture, religion, and languages, presents both an opportunity and a challenge for national unity. In the 1990s, the People's Movement emphasized freedom, equality, democracy, and humanity, representing civic nationalism. Subsequently, a decade-long armed conflict led by the Nepal Communist Party (Maoist) and regional people's movements and the 2006 People's Movement inspired civic and ethnic nationalism. This period saw rural armed conflict and urban peaceful movements for these forms of nationalism. Since 2006, there has been a strong demand for proper representation of citizens from various classes, castes, and ethnic groups in the state apparatus, recognizing their unique identities. The chapter aims to discuss the political, economic, and environmental world order in the context of Nepal and the globe after the 1990s. Internal factors such as failed state-centric nationalism, development issues, poverty, inequality, injustice, lack of freedom, and global influences of neoliberal economic policies played a significant role in shaping Nepal's national movement. These conflicts and movements challenged the spirit of harmony and co-existence among the people, resulting in loss of lives, displacement, and suffering. To address issues like inequality, injustice, and representation, Nepal adopted a federal republic governance system with three tiers (local, provincial, and federal), a secular state, and inclusive democracy. These reforms have partially addressed governance and representation issues and promoted diversity and mutual respect for culture, religion, identities, and language. Nepal's multi-party system has maintained national unity through the principles of unity in diversity and diversity in unity. The nation has demonstrated tolerance, forgiveness, negotiation, and reconciliation to maintain harmony among its diverse population.\n\nThe birth of the concept of nationalism and national unity happened in Nepal, more or less at the same time as in Europe, by the second half of the Eighteenth century. Nationalism is seen as an ideology that demands loyalty and devotion to the notion of authority from individuals or groups. While Nepal has come a long way in the process of growth of nationalism and national unity, they have been nurtured by significant nation building measures at important junctures in Nepal&#39;s history. But recent events have shown that they remain vulnerable to external adversaries and influences and interventions. Indeed, the founding father of the modern Nepal, King Prithvi Narayan Shah&#39;s dictum, “Nepal as a yam between two boulders” remains equally valid ever for Nepal’s foreign policy. A metaphor of “yam” in his maxim connotes Nepal’s geo–strategic position which, like a soft edible starchy staple food in tropical and subtropical areas, has to maintain its balanced relations with two big...\n\nNepal, the small country in South Asia is in political transition phase with declaration of Federal Democratic Republican Country. All sectors of the society came on surface demanding for equal rights and equal participation as others in the country. Among these, indigenous ethnic groups of Nepal established common platform called Nepal Federation of Indigenous nationalities as umbrella organization for the collective voices. This helps to bring common issues that needs to be addressed by the government. Despite of this effort, political ideological affiliation with political parties helps to deteriorate the movement and its trajectories, affected ethnic politics in Nepal. Nevertheless, many those who are affiliated with ethnic politics helps individual personal development. Members who are affiliated with ethnic organization are carried away with primordial feelings of being the member of the group as well as becoming more instrumental achieving individual benefit standing ethnic organization."
