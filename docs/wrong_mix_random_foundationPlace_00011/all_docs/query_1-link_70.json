        "text": "Girl students’ skirts too short in Chitwan – The inspection team\n\nAug 10, 2012 @ 17:46\n\nThe inspection team sent by Higher Secondary Education Council from Kathmandu visited the colleges in Chitwan Â district for inspection and finding girl students in higher secondary schools (+2 colleges) wearing short skirt, has advised the length of skirt should be below knee.\n\nAccording to the District Education Office (DEO, the team made this suggestion after monitoring many higher secondary schools and the team also found many â€˜+2′ colleges in Chitwan with lack of fully-equipped laboratories and libraries. They also found the poor condition of other school infrastructures like classes, canteens and toilets. The school buildings housing students beyond their capacity were also found.\n\nThe inspection team was sent after receiving complaints that the colleges in Chitwan were being run without proper infrastructures and there is connection between colleges and bridge course and tuition institutes for mutual benefit.\n\nGai Jatra Celebrated\n\nAug 4, 2012 @ 12:21\n\nGaijatra, the festival of cows was observed across the country on Friday. It is the festival celebrated by Newar community in which families, who have lost their members and relatives during the year paraded the streets, especially in the Capital, disguised as cows or with actual decorated cows, in memory of the deceased.\n\n‘Gai’ or ‘cow’ helps departed souls cross a cosmic river called Baitarini in their journey after death, according to the religious scriptures. And according to another popular belief, King Pratap Malla initiated the festival in the 17th century to console his wife, who was in deep sorrow due to the untimely demise of her son Chakrapatendra Malla. Everyone in the country tried to make her laugh by coming out with cows and mimicry and also showed that she was not alone who have lost someone.\n\nContinue reading\n\nIt seems, the marriage of Manisha Koirala with Samrat Dahal is not going to last long. Last time, Manisha posted about her intention of divorce in May. She has done it again – by posting a bit more sad and harsh message in Facebook. The message reads:\n\nMy husband has become my enemy. How much worst can it become for a women?\n\nLast time, the difference between the couple was was patched when friends and families helped them to soothe the relationship wounds. Manisha clarified that it was a minor issue with her husband.\n\nContinue reading\n\nActress Manisha Koirala started her movie career with a Nepali movie ‘Pheri Bhetaula’ some 20 years ago. After that, her second Nepali movie, Dharma, is going to be released soon. After hundreds of successful Hindi movies, Manisha’s second Nepali movie will mark her re-entry in the Nepali movie industry.\n\nManisha seemed excited in the press meet organized to formally announce the start of the promotion of the movie. She was wearing the red ‘sindoor’ to imply she is in good relationship with her husband, Samrat Dahal. She, however refused to talk about the issue.\n\nThe press meet was organized in Hotel Sangrila, Manisha was present with her mother. Also present were, Dharma director Dipedra K Khanal, producer Durga Pokharel, actor Sanyog Pokharel and other film related personnel.\n\nContinue reading\n\nTimes and again it is proven that, nothing is private in the life of a celebrity. In a latest example, Manisha’s minor disagreement and a hasty Facebook post has created further headache to Manisha’s married life. The original Facebook post was deleted within a few hours and the current post is much better saying, she was â€œsuper happyâ€ with her partner.\n\nIn the context of divorce rumor in media, the sources closer to Manisha are suspecting one of the Indian medias for not letting the rumor subside. The unnamed Indian media is told to be particularly interested in Manisha Koirala gossips and was responsible to blow the minor event out of proportion. I suspect, they might be pointing towards a Nepali daily, Himalaya Darpan, published from Silgudi, India. Himalayan Darpan, in its Nov. 23 Tuesday’s edition, published a front page article with title “Manisha wants divorce”.\n\nThe Manisha family source however, couldn’t deny the misunderstanding between Manisha and Samrat. But, it is also told that the event was minor misunderstanding, not big enough to warrant divorce. Manisha’s parents are told to be saddened by the divorce rumor in the media.\n\nContinue reading\n\nManisha and Samrat were having problem in their 5-month-long married life and she had moved to her parents’ house after the disagreement.\n\nSome Indian newspapers are reporting that Manisha posted a message in her Facebook status about her desire to get a divorce. The shocking status post however was removed after a few hours. It is told that the status message told that her married life was a roller coaster ride and she is planning to get a divorce. She also added that the decision will not hurt her parents.\n\nContinue reading\n\nAfter 20 years and hundreds of movies in Bollywood, the Indian movie world, Manisha Koirala did her second Nepali movie under the direction of Dipendra K. Khanal.\n\nThe movie named \"Dharma\" will mark as the reentry of Manisha in Nepali cinema. After her marriage with Samrat Dahal, she is seeking ways to settle down in Nepal. Her desire to produce a Nepali movie can be taken as the indication that she wants to move back home.\n\nTalking in a program organized in the World Trade Center in Kathmandu for the release of audio of Dharma, Manisha told that she is planning to produce a Nepali movie. She also told that she has already started working on the script.\n\nContinue reading"
