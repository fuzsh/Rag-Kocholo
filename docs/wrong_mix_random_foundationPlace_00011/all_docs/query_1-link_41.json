In a statement, Manisha said, “I am very happy to get this role. I wanted to act in different films with challenging roles after marriage and this is just perfect. I am looking forward to start working in this film.”\n\nUnder the banner of Yograj Cinevista, the film will start rolling once the rest of the cast and crew are finalised. According to a statement issued by the producer, “We are making this women-centric film under the banner of Yograj Cinevista, in which Manisha will be playing the role of a politician.” In real life, Manisha’s grandfather BP Koirala is the first elected Prime Minister of Nepal. The actress, who debuted in Bollywood in 1991 with Subhash Ghai’s ‘Saudagar’, said that she always wanted to play the role of a politician. She has other projects in her hand apart from this unnamed movie. These include Rohit Kaushik’s ‘Chehere’, Deepti Naval’s directorial debut ‘Do Paise Ki Dhoop’ and director Onir’s ‘I Am’ series, where she will be seen playing a Kashmiri woman."
