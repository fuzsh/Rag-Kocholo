        "text": "It is an arranged match — both their families have known each other for a long time. Manisha’s mother spoke to her about Samrat and things quickly fell into place after the actress gave her approval. An astrologer was consulted and he has announced the auspicious dates for the wedding.\n\nManisha Koirala\n\nManisha has confirmed the news but was not keen to share many details about the development.\n\nEarlier, there was speculation that Manisha would be tying the knot with American author Christopher Dolan, who lives in Dallas. The two had met in Paris and had bonded over books.\n\nSamrat is an MBA from the US and is said to be in process of setting up an alternative energy company in Nepal, besides handling his family business in Kathmandu. The wedding will be a typically Nepali affair, and Manisha will be flying in some of her close friends including Deepti Naval, Anu, Avinash and Paulomi Sanghvi for the occasion.\n\nA close friend said, “Manisha was looking for her soul mate and she seems to have found one in Samrat.”\n\nSamrat Dahal\n\nIncidentally, Manisha had announced some time ago that she wants to settle down by the time she reaches 40. And her wish is coming true.\n\nAfter her debut in Subhash Ghai’s Saudagar in 1989, she had a 21-year run in Bollywood. She was last seen in a Bangla film with Prosenjit. Manisha is committed to do Sanjay Leela Bhansali’s My Friend Pinto, co-starring Naseeruddin Shah and Pratik."
