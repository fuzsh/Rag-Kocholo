She regrets not taking a break.\n\n\"I did some films which I should not have done. This is the reason why one should take a break, because I was getting bored with my work. I needed a break,\" Manisha told reporters here, without naming any films.\n\n\"My interest was going away from my work, so I should not have done few films. Had I taken a break at that time, it would have worked for me. Later I took break, but it was much-needed,\" she added.\n\nManisha is known for featuring in films like Saudagar, 1942: A Love Story, Bombay, Khamoshi: The Musical and Dil Se... She married businessman Samrat Dahal in 2010, and was last seen on the big screen in Onir's I Am.\n\nThe actress says she has learnt from her mistakes.\n\n\"I realised that any wrong move that happens, one can only learn from it and grow. I do regret I did bad choice of films, but I have learnt from it,\" the 42-year-old said.\n\nSoon after her wedding, there were reports that her marriage was on doldrums, but Manisha wasn't keen to open up about her personal life.\n\n\"I don't want to talk about it. This is an area which is very sensitive and I will not talk about it. I am very happy right now. I am in a very good space. I have to grow and maintain balance,\" she added.\n\nBhoot Returns, releasing Oct 12, also features J.D. Chakravarthy, Madhu Shalini and Alayana Sharma.\n\nEntertainment I Read Latest News on NDTV Entertainment.
