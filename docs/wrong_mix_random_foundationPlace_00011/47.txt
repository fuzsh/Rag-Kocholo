There are very few celebs from Bollywood who, after having to go through a bad relationship or a failed marriage, muster the courage to talk it. Here’s one actress who recently came into the news precisely because of this.

The actress here is one of Bollywood’s favourite 90s actresses, Manisha Koirala. The diva who is loved for her roles in movies like Saudagar, 1942: A Love Story, Akele Hum Akele Hum, Gupt, Bombay and Khamoshi, recently opened up about her failed marriage with businessman Samrat Dahal. She met Samrat on Facebook before tying the knot.

The 46-year-old actress married Samrat on June 19, 2010, according to traditional Nepali rituals and the couple’s divorce came through in 2012. The same year, Manisha was diagnosed with cancer for which she flew to New York for treatment. In 2015, Manisha announced that she was cancer-free and gearing up to resume her career.

In an interview, Manisha accepted that she was the one to be blamed for her brief marriage with Samrat. She acknowledged the fact that her definition of marriage was rather a dreamy one, which was one of the reasons that led to the split.

Speaking about her idea of marriage and if there was any bitterness, the actress said:

"I had a dreamy idea of marriage. If you are in a bad relationship then it's better to separate. There is no bitterness."

"I take full responsibility of hurrying up and wanting to get married and then realising I am not meant for this. There is no fault from other side, the fault is mine.”

As we said earlier, it takes a lot to accept one’s flaws, especially when you are a celebrity under the spotlight quite often! Hats off to Manisha for gracefully accepting her shortcoming and not blaming anyone else for her failed marriage.

On the personal front, after beating cancer in 2015, Manisha recently spoke about embracing motherhood. Manisha is planning to adopt a baby girl by the end of 2017.

"This December, it'll be five years since I got completely cured. If everything goes well, I'm planning to adopt a baby girl. I just hope everything goes right and it all falls into place. I want to be there for the child, and I'll make sure that I plan my life around this. I'm super excited about this new phase in my life, and I can't wait for it to begin.”

Manisha is busy with her upcoming movie Dear Maya where she essays the role of a woman who is looking for love and otherwise, mostly engrossed in her pain. Her life changes when she receives a letter from a mysterious man. The trailer was received well by the audience and the movie releases on June 2, 2017. Manisha will also be seen in Sanjay Dutt’s biopic starring Ranbir Kapoor. She will play the role of Sanjay’s mother, Nargis Dutt.
