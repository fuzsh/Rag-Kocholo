Actress Manisha Koirala is set to tie the knot with a Nepalese businessman on June 19 following a two-year courtship.

The 40-year-old actress is marrying Samrat Dahal, a young businessman from Maharajgunj, The Himalayan Times reported

today.

"He (Dahal) is well-educated and comes from a family with an excellent background. I like him and I respect her decision," Manisha's politician father Prakash Koirala was quoted as saying.

US-educated Dahal owns a company that deals with alternative energy. Originally from Sindhuli district of Nepal, he is the son of Surendra Dahal, the owner of Leather Wings.

It is not sure whether Manisha will quit the tinsel town after her June 19 wedding, but her soon-to-be life partner said he would leave it all to her, the paper reported.

The courtship between the couple started two years back and only three weeks ago Manisha decided to marry Dahal, the report said.

According to family sources, priests have proposed June 17 for the 'Swayamvar' ceremony, June 18 for 'Mehendi' and June 19 for the marriage, it said.

Manisha made her foray into the world of cinema with a Nepali movie Pheri Bhetaula.

In 1991, Bollywood director Subhash Ghai gave her a break in Saudagar, a mega hit. She also earned accolades for her work in Vidhu Vinod Chopra's 1942, A Love Story in which she was paired with Anil Kapoor.

Granddaughter of Nepal's first prime minister BP Koirala, Manisha last visited Kathmandu when five-time premier Girija Prasad Koirala, brother of BP Koirala, died on March 20.

She is currently busy shooting for a Telegu film in Kerala, the report said.
