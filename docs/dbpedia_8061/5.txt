Sirico also appeared in Allen’s pre-Sopranos films Deconstructing Harry, Everyone Says I Love You and Bullets Over Broadway. Recent credits include Touched, Friends And Romans, Lilyhammer and Family Guy. He is repped by McGowan Management.

Meagen Fay has joined the cast of Whiplash helmer Damien Chazelle’s musical feature La La Land, in which Ryan Gosling stars as a jazz pianist who falls for an aspiring actress (Emma Stone). Fay will play the actress’ mother. Her recent credits include ABC’s upcoming The Muppets, the Entourage movie, Mad Men, Agent Carter and Murder In The First. She is repped by KMR and Main Title.
