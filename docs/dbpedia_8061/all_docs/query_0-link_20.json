        "text": "The Sopranos\n\nMICHAEL GANDOLFINI IS ENJOYING HIS FATHER’S LEGACY\n\nLife is good for Michael Gandolfini. And why not? He’s only 19 years old and already starring in a major feature film – Newark (formerly The Many Saints of Newark) playing the younger version of his father James Gandolfini’s beloved character Tony Soprano. The movie is set in the 1960’s and features the Newark race riots. It won’t be released until September 2020, and Michael already has two other movies under his belt, and you saw him in a recurring role on The Deuce. On top of that he has a cute new girlfriend!\n\nPhoto Credit: BACKGRID-USA\n\nDOES THIS SMILE LOOK FAMILIAR?\n\nJames Gandolfini’s son Michael, 19, is set to star in a prequel to The Sopranos called The Many Saints of Newark. You may remember, the last scene of The Sopranos was filmed in this booth at Holsten’s ice cream parlor in Bloomfield, New Jersey. Holsten’s owner made the most of the event by putting a sign at the booth dedicated to the Sopranos and he posted this photo of Micheal after he paid the place a visit…\n\nTONY SIRICO IS ALWAYS IN CHARGE\n\nLook who’s appearing in Woody Allen’s currently filming untitled movie set in the late ‘50s: Soprano stars Tony Sirico and Steve Schirripa! We didn’t realize it, but this is Tony’s SIXTH movie with Woody. We’ve known Tony for YEARS – in fact, his name was Junior back in those early New York days. Junior (don’t you dare call him that now!) was the doorman/bouncer at a hot club, and he MEANT BUSINESS. His black hair was slicked back and as shiny as his suit. Cute girls were always welcome, but guys had to wait outside. Any guy who got out of line at that club lived to regret it. Oh, and Junior never went anywhere without packing heat. He was the real thing. And now he’s a movie star- who would have guessed!\n\nPhoto Credit: Pacific Coast News\n\nJAMES GANDOLFINI DIED WITH A FULL STOMACH\n\nThe loss of James Gandolfini at the age of 51 is truly an American tragedy. Many fans cherished the hope that The Sopranos would return in a movie. Unfortunately, James was stuggling with alcohol again. His self destructive last meal at 7 PM on the night he died was at the Boscolo Exedra Roma hotel restaurant, according to the NY Post. He dined with his 13 year old son Michael and managed to down two pina coladas, 4 shots of rum, and two beers with the meal. Gandolfini consumed two orders of deep fried prawns covered in mayonnaise chili sauce, and a large portion of foie gras. Michael had his own meal and two virgin coladas. Three hours later James Gandolfini was discovered in cardiac arrest. So sad.\n\nEXCUSE ME, IS THAT TONY SOPRANO IN THE GUN DEPARTMENT?\n\nA friend of ours was gazing in the showcase of the gun department at Big 5 Sporting Goods on Wilshire when he became aware of someone’s labored breathing next to him and it sounded oddly familiar. He looked up and the man said with a thick New York accent “They sell guns here?” It was James Gandolfini, clad in sweatpants and sneakers (no gold jewelry.) The Sopranos star and a buddy glanced at the guns, but they drifted over to the knife department and purchased pocket knives.\n\nLORRAINE BRACCO: FROM ROBBERS TO COPS\n\nLorraine Bracco has gotten a bit more voluptuous since she appeared on “The Sopranos” but she’s still keeping busy. Lorraine, who was nominated for an Oscar for “Goodfellas,” has her own wine company and a new show starting next month on TNT. It’s a cop series called “Rizzoli & Isles” and Lorraine plays Angie Harmon’s mother.\n\nEVERYBODY RECOGNIZES TONY SIRICO FROM “THE SOPRANOS”\n\n“Sopranos” star Tony Sirico dined at Boa steakhouse on Sunset and outside he chatted up a guy we don’t know, carrying a huge trophy. Tony was last seen in March playing a mobster on “Chuck.” He says he’s done “around 45 movies, playing 40 gangsters and 5 crooked cops.” And he doesn’t mind at all being typecast. When he was young, Tony was a real-life gun-toting mobster and served time in the slammer before he discovered acting. Yet he insists he’s a right wing Republican!\n\nTURTLE'S MOVING FASTER THESE DAYS\n\nPhoto Credit: Buzz Foto\n\nHere’s one of the cuter couples in Hollywood. When Sopranos star Jamie-Lynn Sigler guested on Entourage, her character flirted with Jerry Ferrara’s “Turtle” character and he could hardly believe his luck. That luck has held out. They’re still seeing each other in real life. Above we have them leaving Chateau Marmont after a party. Note that Jerry is dressing better since Jamie-Lynn came along.\n\nTHE SOPRANOS: THE BEST THING THAT EVER HAPPENED TO ROBERT ILER\n\nHis affiliation with The Sopranos still opens doors and get party invites for Robert Iler, who played Tony Soprano’s moody son, A.J. He and Jamie-Lynn Sigler got the red carpet treatment at the new club Cabana One at the Mayfair Hotel in Miami. He still has that pasty New York look, though."
