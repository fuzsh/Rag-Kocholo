        "text": "Celebrity\n\nUSA 1998\n\nReviewed by Leslie Felperin\n\nSynopsis\n\nOur synopses give away the plot in full, including surprise twists.\n\nManhattan. Lee is an unsuccessful novelist and travel journalist who's now doing well as a celebrity-profile writer; his ex-wife Robin is an English teacher, adrift in life now that her marriage has ended. Lee gets a blow-job from Nicole Oliver, a famous movie star, chats up a waitress/actress named Nola, and later picks up a supermodel, even though he is in a serious relationship with Bonnie, a book editor. While visiting a plastic surgeon for a consultation, Robin meets handsome television producer Tony. On their first date at a film premiere they run into Lee and Bonnie. Robin gets drunk and hurls abuse at Lee. Nonetheless, Tony is smitten with her, and offers her a job at his production company where she eventually flourishes despite her initial lack of experience.\n\nEncouraged by Bonnie, Lee works on a novel for a year. But he meets Nola again at a restaurant and becomes infatuated with her. On the day Bonnie is to move in with him, Lee splits up with her, so she chucks the only copy of his novel in the Hudson river.\n\nTime passes. Lee is in a fractious relationship that seems poised to fail with the flighty Nola. Robin has become the presenter of a society-focused news report produced by Tony's company. Jittery and apprehensive, she leaves Tony standing at the altar on their wedding day, but they eventually marry. At the premiere of Nicole's film, a happy Robin and Tony arrive together and warmly greet Lee, now lonely and adrift.\n\nReview\n\nThe first 'Woodyless' Woody Allen film since Bullets over Broadway, Celebrity tempts you to think that Allen may suddenly have wised up to the fact that audiences find it increasingly hard to swallow the notion of him as a lady-killer alluring enough to pull the comely likes of Elisabeth Shue (Deconstructing Harry), Julia Roberts (Everyone Says I Love You) or Juliette Lewis (Husbands and Wives). So for Celebrity Allen has brought in sexier, younger Kenneth Branagh as his representative on screen. Always a better actor than he is a director, especially at comedy, Branagh clearly enjoys his jaunt in Woody-drag, hugging his corduroy jacket around him like a protective girdle and mimicking the nasal stutter, but it's more a top-grade impersonation than a performance.\n\nGiving the persona a facelift by casting someone a generation younger still leaves a few ugly scars that mar this comedy of manners. The fit is just not quite right. For a start Branagh looks too goyische, so the New York-Jewish locutions of the dialogue make him seem even more the ventriloquist's dummy. He's completely out of place in a flashback to a high-school reunion populated by the kind of middle-aged, lower-to-middle-class grotesques Allen so often contextualises himself against, and among whom the director himself looks exactly of a piece. And sure, guys Lee's age can be just as sexist and groin-fixated as their fathers, but they're usually a bit smoother about disguising the fact and generally more cautious, crabbed and calculating. So it makes practically no sense that an ambitious lad like Branagh's Lee would throw over successful, well-connected and frankly stunning Bonnie for dippy Nola unless he was afflicted by a certain 50s-to-60s-vintage romanticism that prizes selfish spontaneity, the love-at-first-sight myth and Twiggy-shaped, quasi-pubescent girls. It's a mind-set straight out of Doris Day movies, but with a hard-on.\n\nThe analysis of celebrity itself, ostensibly the meat of the movie, is similarly that of a much older man. A whiny despair that the talentless usually rise to the top and that people become famous for the flimsiest of reasons seems to be the main thesis of the film. It's a worn complaint, and EdTV and The Truman Show have had fresher thoughts to contribute on the matter recently. At one point, Judy Davis' Robin (a magnificent performance of spite, wounded pride and touching resilience), having become a reporter-courtier to the rich and famous, casually mentions that everyone's a celebrity now - she just profiled Sunny von Bulow \"and she just lies there.\" (Sunny is the now-comatose high-society wife whom Claus von Bulow allegedly tried to kill.)\n\nAllen's darts at fatuous publishers and film critics fly with more accuracy than his barbs at fashion folk, modern Catholicism or the hedonism of Hollywood types (incarnated by a hilarious, self-immolating cameo by Leonardo DiCaprio). Celebrity lacks the misanthropic gusto of Deconstructing Harry as well as that film's flashy formal control and feels like Allen on autopilot.\n\nCredits"
