        "text": "Emma Stone, who stars in this past weekend’s box-office winner The Amazing Spider-Man 2, has joined Woody Allen‘s next film. She’ll star alongside Joaquin Phoenix.\n\nPHOTOS: The Making of Woody Allen’s ‘Midnight in Paris’\n\nA title for the new project, which Allen will likely write, produce and direct, has yet to be revealed, and few details are known about the plot, which is the status quo for a new Woody Allen project.\n\nAllen, who is known for working with the same actors over several films, has never worked with Phoenix before, but he did team with Stone on his most recent film, Magic in the Moonlight, which is currently in post-production. The prolific director’s latest film to hit theaters, Blue Jasmine, earned an Oscar and a Golden Globe for actress Cate Blanchett and took in $97.5 million at the box office."
