        "text": "Mojo Nixon and Skid Roper were right: “Elvis Is Everywhere!” So drop your needle on the Dead Milkmen because, we are “Going to Graceland.” Don’t let the rockabilly sounds of Elvis Hitler bum your trip. (Remember, in our Beatles’ movies tribute, we called out the More Fiends for their cover-hybid of Motorhead and the Beatles on “Yellow Spades”? Well, not to be outdone: Elvis Hitler grafted Hendrix to the theme of TV’s Green Acres . . . and Pittsburgh’s John Russo made their video!)\n\nOkay, uh, let’s get back to The King.\n\nElvis Presley may have died on August 16, 1977 . . . and transitioned into the rock ‘n’ roll ethers to party alongside Jim Morrison, Jimi Hendrix, Janis Joplin, and Kurt Cobain at “Club 27,” just south of the right foot of God. However, when it comes to the film industry: you can check out anytime you like, but you can never leave . . . in spite of the famous, last words of KWKH’s Horace Lee Logan about Elvis leaving the building.\n\nAs you can tell by this latest “Exploring” feature’s title: this isn’t about the movies that starred the “real” Elvis, such as Love Me Tender and Change of Habit, and so on . . . but we did check out all of Elvis’s flicks behind the wheel with a “Drive in Friday: Elvis Racing Nite!” feature. And don’t come-a-knockin’ for any of the wealth of theatrical, television, and direct-to-video documentaries on Elvis.\n\nAs with our three-part “The Beatles: Influence on Film” series, this “Exploring” feature on Elvis is concerned with the speculative flicks, the films using the myth and legend of Elvis as plot fodder, and the historical sidebars to his career.\n\nLet’s fire up that VCR . . . and don’t break your pelvis!\n\nLiving Legend: The King of Rock ‘n Roll (1980) — 2 Stars\n\nSelf-made North Carolina filmmaker Earl Owensby (Dark Sunday) co-stars alongside Elvis’s ex-fiancee Ginger Alden in the ersatz tale of Eli Caufield, the King of Rock & Roll. As with the real King: Eli rules supreme on stage, but in private, his life is a mess, as he spirals with declining health issues and an escalating prescription medication addiction.\n\nRoy Orbison stands in for Owensby’s vocals. Director Thom McIntyre also helmed Ginger Alden’s starring role in the country music-centric Lady Grey; he found great success with the Mighty Morphin Power Rangers, U.S. television franchise.\n\nNext up, Elvis receives a fan’s love letter.\n\nTo Elvis, with Love, aka Touched by Love (1980) — 3 Stars\n\nSigh. This Elvis flick—alongside A Little Romance—incessantly running on HBO started our lifelong crush with Diane Lane. Deborah Raffin (Hanging on a Star) stars as a young nurse determined to reach an unresponsive teenage cerebral palsy patient by encouraging her to write to her favorite rock singer, Elvis Presley (no, he doesn’t show up).\n\nThe film, based on the real-life reminiscences of Lena Canada (from her book To Elvis, with Love), is a very sweet, well-made family-friendly film. The critics: forever running hot and cold. Deborah Raffin was nominated for both, a Golden Globe Award for “Best Actress in a Motion Picture Drama,” as well as a Golden Raspberry for “Worst Actress” for her performance. The film’s second Razzie nod came courtesy of Hesper Anderson’s screenplay. A TV series scribe (Marcus Welby, M.D), Anderson also composed the TV movie The UFO Incident (the world-famous Barney and Bette Hill incident) and fared much better with critics by way of her next theatrical work, Children of a Lesser God.\n\nDirector Gus Trikonis . . . yes, the man behind Supercock (the Ross Hagan one about illegal cockfighting, dirty mind), Nashville Girl, The Evil, Moonshine County Express, and Take This Job and Shove It, directed this. No, really. Then he did a “real” Elvis movie with Don Johnson as The King, in the TV Movie, Elvis and the Beauty Queen.\n\nNext up, here come the Elvis weirdos.\n\nMondo Elvis (1984/documentary) — 2 1/2 Stars\n\nOkay, so it’s a “documentary,” but it does deal with the “fantasies” of El’s fans. Do you have a hankerin’ to learn more about the fans who can’t give up the “ghost” . . . to go along with your Peanut Butter and ‘Nana sandwiches? Well, here’s your chance to meet an eclectic bunch who explain how The King touched their lives . . . just a little too deeply.\n\nNext up, Elvis schools two lads on the art of motorcycle racing.\n\nEat the Peach (1986/drama) — 2 Stars\n\nWould you believe Elvis . . . as the inspiration for motorcycle stuntmen? So goes this Irish comedy—with its title derived from the T.S Elliot poem “The Love Song of J. Alfred Prufock”—about two unemployed lads who, after watching Elvis Presley’s 1964 opus Roustabout, hatch a plan to change their fortunes by becoming motorcycle stuntmen. If you’re a fan of Bill Foresyth’s early ’80s comedies Comfort and Joy and Gregory’s Girl from across the pond—both which incessantly spun on HBO back in the day—you’ll enjoy this Elvis-inspired comedy also adopted by the U.S cable channel.\n\nNext up, Elvis is kidnapped!\n\nHeartbreak Hotel (1988/comedy) — 2 Stars\n\nFirst Elvis inspires motorcycle stuntmen in Eat the Peach, now he gets kidnapped . . . in a tale written and directed by a pre-Home Alone Christopher Columbus, in his follow up to Adventures in Babysitting. Charlie Schlatter (of TVs Diagnosis Murder) is Johnny Wolfe; he kidnaps Elvis (David Keith of Officer and a Gentleman) from a 1972 concert in Cleveland with the purpose to take him home to meet his mother (Tuesday Weld; meta-starred with Elvis in 1961’s Wild in the Country), a sickly, obsessed Elvis fan. The always reliable David Keith is fun to watch as he channels Elvis, but TV actor Charlie Schlatter isn’t a marquee actor and no Michael J. Fox (who could have made this really work), thus, this drags to a drab, TV movie-styled production.\n\nNext up, the “ghost” of Elvis appears in a Memphis hotel.\n\nMystery Train (1989/drama) — 4 Stars\n\nThis Jim Jarmusch multi-character study takes place in the Arcade, a rundown Memphis hotel. Its occupants are foreigner travelers fascinated with all thing Americana—especially Elvis. The stories include a Japanese couple who visit Graceland, but are split on their fandom of Carl Perkins vs. Elvis. There’s an Italian widow who meets a stranger who tries to sell her a comb—that belonged to a hitchhiking Elvis. Finally, Joe Strummer of the Clash (following his role in Straight to Hell), is an Elvis loving, side-burned crook who goes into hiding after a liquor story robber gone bad. Steve Buscemi (Airheads) shows up (bonus!), along with ’60s rocker Screaming Jay Hawkins following up his appearance in Jaramusch’s Stranger than Paradise.\n\nAs for Elvis, he takes up . . . sky diving?\n\nHoneymoon in Vegas (1992) — 2 1/2 Stars\n\nFilm historian Andrew Bergman, who brought Marlon Brando back to the screen in The Freshman, scores as writer and director—courtesy of James Caan, Nicolas Cage, and Pat Morita (we can so without Sarah Jessica Parker, ugh) bringing their A-games to the tables. When Cage’s private eye loses $65,000 in Las Vegas poker game, he’s quickly mixed up with Caan’s professional gambler and assisted by Pat’s ne’er-do-well taxi driver to beat the debt. When does The King show up? Well, do you not know your classic movie scenes? Cage gets mixed up with—and jumps in full El regalia—the Utah chapter of “The Flying Elvises,” a skydiving team of Elvis impersonators. Cage, needless to say, garnered a well-deserved “Best Actor in a Motion Picture” nod at the Golden Globes. (Did you check out our “Nic Cage Bitch” feature? Well, you should.)\n\nNext up for the King, he leaves Vegas for Providence, Rhode Island.\n\nIt’s a Complex World (1992/comedy) — 1 Star\n\nJeff Burgess is the manager of a Providence rock club, The Heartbreak Hotel. A disappointment to his ex-CIA agent father running for the Presidency, Dad feels his son’s rock club will negatively affect the presidential campaign: so he hires revolutionaries to stage a terrorist bombing at the club. As the terrorists close in, a biker gang (headed by Captain Lou Albano!) trashes the club. So, Elvis isn’t going to let his namesake be destroyed; he calls a Beatles tribute band appearing at the club—from beyond the grave, natch—to help Jeff fight off the villains. Blues rockers NRBQ (who appear on the film soundtracks for Tuff Turf and Spring Break) show up at the club for a few tunes, in addition to the New England bands Beat Legend and Stanley Matis and the Young Adults.\n\nAs for Elvis, well, his ghost reappears to a comic store clerk.\n\nTrue Romance (1993/action) — 4 Stars\n\nChristian Slater stars in this post-Reservoir Dogs Quentin Tarentino romp (directed by Tony Scott) as a comic book store clerk falling for the wrong girl, which leads him to become a “murderer” pursued by the mob. During those times o’ trouble: Slater turns to the ghost of Elvis (Val Kilmer) for some friendly advice. Yes, Slater, later crosses paths with The King in 3000 Miles to Graceland.\n\nAs for Elvis, he’s off to learn a few dance steps from some kid.\n\nForrest Gump (1994/drama) — 4 Stars\n\nYeah, the ‘60s greatest hits compilation soundtrack is great. Okay, well, maybe it’s a little nostalgia-evoking heavy handed. And we could do without Robin Wright. But hey, at least we, finally, know where The King picked up those dance moves that earned him the name “Elvis the Pelvis.” Peter Dobson turns in a brief, yet fun turn as King El; he brings it back, again, in a larger role as ol’ El in Protecting the King.\n\nYikes! The King’s mummified remains return.\n\nFrankenstein Sings . . . The Movie (1995/comedy) — 1/2 Star\n\nAlec Sokolow and Joel Cohen, the creative team behind this musical comedy, made this in the same year as their Pixar Animation game changer, Toy Story. They’d go on to give us two Garfield movies and Evan Almighty; their earlier work, the 1988 televangelist spoof, Pass the Ammo, became a oft-ran pay cable favorite (pair it with Beth B.’s Salvation!). An amalgamate of Bobby “Boris” Pickett’s early ’60s novelty hit “Monster Mash” and an adaption of late ’60s stage musical, I’m Sorry the Bridge is Out, You’ll Have to Spend the Night, this also stars Pickett himself, as Dr. Frankenstein.\n\nThe pedigree is here, but why don’t I like this . . . am I biased to anything with Candace Cameron from TV’s Full House? No. Well, yes. But you know me with movies that feel to need to explain that “it’s a movie” (Hamburger: The Motion Picture will get you started): failure is afoot.\n\nSo, what’s this all have to do with Elvis?\n\nWell, a young couple (Cameron) stranded on Halloween Night seeks refuge in the mansion of Dr. Frankenstein. As luck would have it, the good Doctor is throwing a party with his Monster, the Wolfman, and his mother, Mr. and Mrs. Dracula—and a mummified Elvis with his agent (Jimmy “JJ” Walker from TV’s Good Times?) as is invited guests. And the blood of a virgin (Cameron, natch) is needed to fully restore the king to life. Ugh. This Trix is for kids. And not even then.\n\nAnd it gets worse: Elvis returns as a vampire.\n\nRockabilly Vampire (1997/comedy) — 1 Star\n\nThe fact that Troma Studios takes on Elvis should be a warning to you. A writer with an obsession for ‘50s culture goes on a quest to prove that Elvis is still alive and well. When she finds the King: he’s a side-burned vampire that wants to the pretty writer to be his new ‘Cilla. Not even the rockabilly soundtrack, helps.\n\nNext up for Elvis: he’s scarfing snack cakes at rural grocery stores.\n\nElvis Is Alive! (1998/comedy) — No Stars\n\nSubtitled: I Swear I Saw Him Eating Ding Dongs Outside the Piggly Wiggly’s . . . well, if you though Rockabilly Vampire was a rough stream of it. Not even the comedic stylings of Fred Willard as an Elvis impersonator helps this ersatz Saturday Night Live skit that goes on way, way, way . . . did I say “way” . . . too long.\n\nOur raison d’etre is, of course, This is Spinal Tap, as a down-on-his-luck filmmaker has no choice but to write and direct a film about, well, the people who swear they’ve seen Elvis Presley . . . even though he’s been dead since 1977. So our faux-Marty Di Bergi travel’s America’s back roads interviewing an eclectic group of people, searching for the “truth”: Is The King still alive? All that is missing from this film is for it to be titled: Elvis Is Alive: The Movie. Yeah, it’s that bad. Yeah, if it’s all dumber than the “Country Music Spinal Tap” dung that is Dill Scallion, with it’s pseudo-Billy Ray Cyrus clone, it probably is. Look, if you absolutely must have a flick with a director on road trip looking for The King, fast forward to The King.\n\nNext up, Elvis puts down the Ding Dongs . . . to become a federal agent?\n\nElvis Meets Nixon (1998/comedy) — 3 Stars\n\nAllan Arkush. That’s all you have to say and I am all in, as the man behind Rock ‘n Roll High School, as well as so many of the Roger Corman-produced films reviewed at B&S About Movies, directs this satirical rock ‘n’ roll tale making a big “what if” guess as to what happened during the infamous 1970 meeting between The King (looks sort-of-close but a still great n’ over-the-top Rick Peters; more TV work than film) and the President (a very funny Bob Gunton, in an antithesis of his role as the sadistic warden in The Shawshank Redemption; he also portrayed Nixon in a Watergate recreation for ABC-TV’s Nightline).\n\nElvis, guilt-tripped by an anti-war activist for contributing to the nation’s counterculture upheavals by influencing the Beatles, decides to correct that wrong by writing the President to become a Federal Drug agent. Comic events, as we say, ensues as El makes his way from Memphis to California to Washington as both men realizes they are in the same boat: they’re losing popularity with the people and desperately want to stay on top.\n\nUnder Arkush’s hand this tongue-in-cheek bioflick-meets-mockumentary is a lot of fun—and what film wouldn’t be so when TV takler Dick Cavett, musician Graham Nash, and Tony Curtis show up (as themselves)? That’s right: Elvis & Nixon, the later, dry-as-a-bone box office dramatic bomb missed the mark on the absurdity of these two egos being in the same room.\n\nWell, El’s off to drift across American once more, back to Graceland.\n\nFinding Graceland (1998/drama) — 3 Stars\n\nJohnathon Schaech (of Tom Hanks’s terrific rock flick, That Thing You Do!, in spite of Liv Tyler’s presence) is an aspiring singer who lost his girlfriend in a car crash: one that he caused, while on his way to Nashville. Harvey Keitel appears as an eccentric drifter—and former Elvis impersonator—who also lost his wife in a tragic accident: on the August 17, 1977, the same day the kind of rock n’ roll died. To cope with his loss, Keitel drifts aimless across the country—believing he is Elvis Presley. While attempting to drive away from the painful memories of the past in his beat up Cadillac, Schaech picks up the hitchhiking Elvis “on his way home” to Graceland. The duo soon ends up in Las Vegas, where Schaech begins a romance with a Marilyn Monroe look-alike and Keitel makes his return to the stage as the King.\n\nHow good is this film? Priscilla Presley enjoyed the script so much, she signed on as Executive Producer. Yeah, there’s a lot of heart up on that screen and Keitel is magnetic. Oh, as for Priscilla, if you’re keeping track: she also produced her own bioflick, Elvis and Me, as well as two TV docs: Elvis: The Tribute and Elvis Presley: The Searcher, as well two Elvis TV series: one a full, cancelled series, with the other a mini-series. Parts of this ended up a direct-to-DVD “what if” doc, Elvis Found Alive.\n\nWhat’s that?\n\nThe U.S is nuked and Elvis has come the “real” “King of America”?\n\nSix-String Samurai (1998/action) — 4 Stars\n\nThe year is 1957: America is a laid waste after a Russian nuclear strike. Only Las Vegas survives as Elvis rules the country—with the kids of America adopting El’s rockabilly style and love of the martial arts. The King dies after 40 years of rule . . . and the samurai warrior musicians he begets begin their fight as heir to the King’s throne. Armed with a samurai sword in one hand and a guitar in the other, a Buddy Holly-lookalike appears from the wasteland using his rock ‘n’ roll and martial art skills to save the day.\n\nThis combination of kung fu ‘n’ roll—call it a sushi-western meets the Wizard of Oz, if you will—stars real life martial arts expert Jeffrey Falcon, a veteran of numerous Hong Kong action films who also scripted, as the Six String Samurai.\n\nWhile absolutely entertaining in its bonkers approach to, well, everything it tosses on-screen, the then very-hip Slamdance Festival buzz wasn’t enough: this bombed at the box office with a less than $200,000 take against its meager, $2 million budget.\n\nAnyway, El’s death is short lived, as he’s reanimated, once again.\n\nRock ‘n’ Roll Frankenstein (1999/comedy) — No Stars\n\nUgh. As if Frankenstein Sings . . . The Movie wasn’t enough to satiate our need for Elvis and Universal monsters cross-pollination. Did Paul Naschy make this? Oh, how we wish. . . .\n\nBernie Stein (yuk, yuk) is a washed up music agent desperate for a new musical talent to put him back on top. As luck would have it: Bernie’s coroner-employed nephew, Frankie Stein (ugh, ugh) developed a rejuvenation process that reanimates dead body parts. So Bernie decides that, instead of looking for new talent: he’ll create his own “ultimate rock star” by using the remains of rock’s greatest legends. Recruiting Iggy, a burnt out roadie with a fetish for desecrating graves, to acquire the legendary body parts, they construct a rock star with Keith Moon’s legs, Jimi Hendrix’s hands, Elvis’s head, and Jim Morrison’s penis. Unfortunately, a stoned Iggy cultivates the sexual organ of Liberace. Now Bernie’s newest star is confused by his sexual identity—as the “Liberace” side of the monster begins to assert itself and overpower the influence of its other, renowned body parts. Bernie’s monster then goes on a killing spree as a result of its sexual confusion.\n\nDoes the fact that the Monster performs the tune “I’m a Manster” and the punk-a-billy outfit Psycho Charger provides the tune, “Lectro Shock,” help? Nope. Everything Six-String Samurai is, this ain’t. This monster mush is just dumb, homophobic, vulgar, well, crap that’s an insult to the Presley estate as it tries to be the next The Rocky Horror Picture Show.\n\nWell, The King is off to rob Las Vegas!\n\n3000 Miles to Graceland (2001/action-comedy) — 1 Star\n\nDo you want to see Kurt Russell—who was Elvis in the John Carpenter-made TV movie, Elvis—portray The King, again (well, sort of), alongside Kevin Costner’s interpretation? Well, here it is, as some ex-cons of the Ocean’s 11-variety plan to rob a Vegas casino during an Elvis Convention Week. Not only did this clear less than $19 million against an $87 million budget, it swept the award nods (but won, none) at the Golden Raspberry and Stinkers Bad Movie Awards—as anything with David Arquette and the perpetually-shrill Courteney Cox, should.\n\nHuh? Elvis meets another President of the United States?\n\nBubba Ho-Tep (2002/horror-comedy) — 4 Stars\n\nLeave it to Don Coscarelli of Phantasm fame and Bruce Campbell of The Evil Dead franchise to channel Elvis Presley . . . and a black “JFK” taking residence in a nursing home to battle an Egyptian vampire-mummy that sucks old people’s souls thru their, well, anus.\n\nThe source material, a novella of the same name, appears in the pages of the anthology The King Is Dead: Tales of Elvis Post-Mortem written by Joe. R. Lansdale; his life is chronicled in the documentary, All Hail the Popcorn King. As for the sequel, Bubba Nosferatu: Curse of the She-Vampires . . . well, that’s never going to a happen. But look for Dynamite Entertainment’s four-issue crossover-miniseries Army of Darkness/Bubba Ho-Tep that continues the tale with Campbell’s Ash Williams teaming with Elvis.\n\nNext up for Elvis, a female serial killer knocks off Elvis impersonators.\n\nElvis Has Left the Building (2005/comedy) — 2 Stars\n\nDirector Joel Zwick and actor John Corbett follow up their hit, My Big Fat Greek Wedding, with this Elvis-inspired comedy that’s not a docudrama about Horace Lee Logan, the disc jockey who first uttered those famous words . . . it’s the comic misadventure of Harmony, the cosmetics saleswoman.\n\nSupernatural forces are at play in the life of Harmony (Kim Basinger), a cosmetics saleswoman who believes her life is eerily entwined with the King—ever since her birth at one of his concerts. So, while on the road selling her lipsticks, she accidentally kills a few Elvis impersonators—and receives the attention of the Feds. Along the way, she falls for an advertising executive (Corbett) on the way to an Elvis convention in Las Vegas, where the real Elvis (Gil McKinney of TV’s ER and Friday Night Lights) shows up alongside Billy Ray Cyrus (ugh) Annie Potts (Pretty In Pink, but TV’s Young Sheldong, these days).\n\nAs for Horace Lee Logan, he produced and hosted the country music radio program Louisiana Hayride, in which Elvis debuted in October 1954 on KWKH—a 50,000-watt superstation broadcasting from Shreveport, Louisiana reaching a mind boggling 28 states.\n\nAnd as for The King: he’s lives via the life of another impersonator.\n\nEddie Presley (2007/drama) — 2 1/2 Stars\n\nWe’ve seen the adventures of Elvis impersonators in 1998s Finding Graceland and 3000 Miles to Graceland. This time out, noted horror film director , known for the Pumpkinhead, The Stepfather, Puppet Master, and Texas Chainsaw Massacre franchises, changes genre gears to direct and produce this story about a down-and-out Tempe, Arizona, security guard who moonlights as an Elvis impersonator. Duane Whitaker, he of the redneck rape scene in Quentin Tarantino’s Pulp Fiction, wrote and starred in the original, one-act play written on which the film is based. Is Whitaker the next Billy Boy Thornton or Chazz Palminteri, here? No, but he’s still quite good in the ersatz-Elvis role. This lumbered around the festival circuits and was hard-to-find since 1992, even in a post-Pulp Fiction world, finding wider exposure on DVD in later years.\n\nNext up, we meet The King . . . and his stepbrother.\n\nProtecting the King (2007/docudrama) — 1 Star\n\nDavid Edward Stanley, Elvis’s real life stepbrother, writes and directs this tale about his job protecting The King of Rock & Roll as his bodyguard, starting at the tender age of 16. Peter Dobson (of Frank Stallone’s failed passion project, The Good Life), who also portrayed Elvis in Forrest Gump, stars. Keep those eyes open for the always welcomed Tom Sizemore (who made his debut in A Matter of Degrees) and Dey Young (who broke our hearts in Rock ‘n’ Roll High School), neither helping, here.\n\nAs for Elvis, he keeps on truckin’ . . .\n\nright to the street near The Heartbreak Hotel.\n\nLonely Street (2009/drama) — 1 1/2 Stars\n\nIn a casting twist of fate: Robert Patrick (the liquid metal “Terminator” in Terminator 2) played Elvis’s father Vernon in the U.S. TV mini-series, Elvis: The Early Years (2005). This time, Patrick may or may not be “The King,” living in seclusion under an assumed name, “Mr. Aaron.” Hounded by a tabloid reporter ready to ready to tell the world that “Elvis lives,” Mr. Aaron (remember, Aaron was Elvis’s dead twin brother) hires a bumbling private eye to keep his secret. Yes. Patrick as Elvis: it’s a stretch, but he makes it work, as great actor, should.\n\nWell, actually . . .\n\nElvis has been living in Simi Valley, California, the whole time.\n\nElvis Found Alive (2012/drama) — 3 Stars\n\nSkilled documentary-mockumentarian Joe Gilbert crafts an entertaining “what if” tale that ties up all the loose ends regarding the facts and fictions, myths and legends, theories and conspiracies concerning all things Elvis . . . from the lips of Jon Burrows, aka Elvis Aaron Presley, himself. Is this Spinal Tap version of the King more enjoyable than watching Tom Hanks goin’ all Oscar as Col. Tom Parker? Oh, you bet your grilled Peanut Butter and ‘Nana sandwiches and a bag o’ chips.\n\nWell, after exploits of his stepbrother in Lonely Street,\n\nwhy not the tales of his real brother, Aaron?\n\nThe Identical (2014/drama) — 1 Star\n\nDid we really need a Christian-based inspiration film based on Elvis . . . if his brother, Aaron, never died? Well, here it is: Twin brothers are unknowingly separated at birth; one of them, Drexel Hemsley, becomes an iconic rock ‘n’ roll star; the other, Ryan Wade, born Dexter Hemsley, struggles in poverty as he battles his adopted preacher-father (Ray Liotta!) in his discovery of music vs. a life in the ministry. Seeing “Elvis,” go ’70 prog-rock, here—since he never died—is an interesting twist, though.\n\nOh, wait . . . Elvis is alive and well in Kalamazoo!\n\nElvis Lives! (2015/comedy) — 4 Stars\n\nWell, indie actor Jonathan Nation may not look like Elvis—and neither did Harvey Keitel, for that matter—but he shines as a past-his-prime Elvis finding redemption as a secret agent for the FBI. As with Joe Gilbert’s previous mock-document, noted Lifetime and Hallmark scribe and Z Nation staff writer Delondra Mesa speculates as to Elvis’s mob ties, faking his death, and building a new life in Kalamazoo, Michigan.\n\nIs Elvis still alive and well, in Alabama? Well, sort of. . . .\n\nOrion: The Man Who Would Be King (2015/documentary) — 4 Stars\n\nThe idea of a “phantom” Elvis first birthed in the fictionalized pages of Gail Brewer Giorgio’s novel, Orion. Published prior to Presley’s August 1977 death—with a somewhat analogous storyline to Jim Morrison’s alleged The Bank of America of Louisiana tome (and predating P.F Kluge’s similarly-styled 1980 novel, Eddie and the Cruisers)—Giorgio’s novel concerned an Elvis-styled singer who faked his death to escape fame.\n\nThen Shelby Singleton, the then owner of Sun Records, Elvis Presley’s old recording home, pinched from Giorgio’s book (Giorgio was not complicit in Singleton’s marketing scheme) and created an Elvis doppelganger: Orion, and hired Alabama-born singer Jimmy Ellis to fill those blue suede shoes. The film tells Ellis’s real life story in the music business.\n\nUgh. Kevin Spacey in an Elvis déjà vu flick?\n\nElvis & Nixon (2016/comedy-drama) — 1/2 Star\n\nJust, no. Rewind the more passionate, Allan Arkush’s Elvis Meets Nixon from 1998. Kevin Spacey is pure Golden Raspberry slicing-ham as Nixon and the always-reliable Michael Shannon as The King? Great in other places, but not here. It’s all just a dumb, major studio boondoggle. Please leave the Elvis flicks to the indie guys. Please.\n\nIt was enviable: Elvis’s car has a tale to tell.\n\nThe King (2018/documentary) — 4 Stars\n\nOkay, we are breaking ranks with this second documentary that takes an inspired approach: Forty years after The King’s death, director Eugene Jarecki sets off across American in Elvis’s 1963 Rolls-Royce Phantom V to explore a life—and how that life affected Americans—via archive footage and interview insights. A really fine, unique work from the filmmaker who gave us insightful, The Trails of Henry Kissinger (2002).\n\nElvis as a twelve-year-old kid?\n\nRolling Elvis (2019/comedy) — 4 Stars\n\nA delightful, Columbia-imported, coming-of-age comedy that reminds of Bill Forsyth’s quirky, Scottish-made films from the ’80s, such as Gregory’s Girl. Set in 1985, an Elvis aficionado forces her child to enter the school talent show as Elvis Presley—as a punishment and alternative for explusion for his perpetual school truancy.\n\nOkay, then how about the King goes sci-fi?\n\nElvis from Outer Space (2020/comedy) — 0 Stars\n\nTake away everything that made Bubba Ho-Tep—with Elvis saving humanity from an ancient Egyptian mummy—enjoyable and you have this tale that explains Elvis’s 1977 death as a cover up for his abduction by aliens from Alpha Centauri. Homesick, the aliens cut a deal with a double-crossing CIA for Elvis to return to Earth. Now a fugitive on the run, the King searches for his daughter Lisa Marie and lost love Linda Thompson—under the covers of a Las Vegas Elvis convention. If you enjoy bad CGI, awful green-screening, no actual Elvis songs, and comedy that’s not funny . . . of a film that’s actual a CGI-reboot for the Tubi age of a forgotten ditty, Memphis Rising: Elvis Lives (2011), then by all means, stream it.\n\nAnd it all comes full circle to . . .\n\nElvis (2022/drama) — 2 Stars\n\nBaz Luhrmann, the Australian filmmaker who wowed us with the worldwide hit romantic comedy Strictly Ballroom (1992), along with the Leonardo DiCaprio-starring William Shakespeare’s Romeo + Juliet (1996), and the Golden Globe Award-winning Moulin Rouge! (2001), writes and direct this biographical drama (that’s either 10-star-loved or one-star hated) starring Tom Hanks as Col. Tom Parker and ex-child/teen star Austin Butler (Disney’s Hannah Montana, Nickelodeon’s iCarly and Zoey 101; he was “Tex Watson” in Once Upon a Time in Hollywood) as Elvis (also in the running: Harry Styles of the boy band, One Direction).\n\nThe Beatles are also back in theaters with the upcoming Midas Man (a beleaguered production with a projected 2023 release) centered on the Beatles’ relationship with their manager, Brian Epstein. You can enjoy the last of our three-part “Exploring: The Beatles: Influences on Film” series to learn more about the film.\n\nThe Rest of the Best with Elvis, Worthy of a Watch on your DVD or Blu:\n\nElvis: The ’68 Comeback Special (1968/TV Special)\n\nElvis: That’s the Way It Is (1970/documentary)\n\nElvis on Tour (1972/concert film)\n\nElvis (1979/TV docudrama) Yes, with Kurt Russell as The King.\n\nElvis and the Beauty Queen (1981/TV docudrama) This time, it’s Don Johnson.\n\nThis Is Elvis (1981/documentary)\n\nElvis and Me (1988/TV docudrama) Hey, it’s Dale Midkiff.\n\nElvis: The Miniseries, aka Elvis: The Early Years in its overseas theatrical life, (2005/TV docudrama) Yep. That’s Jonathan Rhys Meyers.\n\nLet’s not forget Elvis’s racing flicks that we rounded up for one of our “Drive-In Friday” features.\n\nAdditional Elvis Reading: Neal Umphred, a name you know from the internationally-acclaimed “Goldmine Price Guide to Collectable Records” series, has an in-depth blog, Elvis – A Touch of Gold, regarding Elvis’s music and records. The way author and music journalist Jim Cherry knows Jim Morrison? Yeah, it’s like that with Neal and Elvis. Visit Neal on the web at his personal website.\n\nAfter speaking with Neal, I’ve learned his favorites are Finding Graceland, 3,000 Miles to Graceland, and The Identical. So take his suggestions and do check out those three films for your Elvis fix.\n\nAbout the Author: You can learn more about the writings of R.D Francis on Facebook. He also writes film reviews for B&S About Movies and publishes on Medium.\n\nWho?\n\nThe one and only “Evil Woman Creeping from Dark” available on Shutterstock for indie filmmakers of the direct-to-video realms to clip-art into orb-tedium.\n\nCourtesy of the investigative entertainment journalism of Felipe M. Guerra, with his article “When the Overuse of Stock Photos Creates an Unexpected ‘Star System’: Familiar faces keep appearing on cheap movie covers,” we’ve come to know the “Evil Woman Creeping from Dark” photo, seen above, is Ukrainian model Maria Konstantynova. We also know that she’s not an actress, she’s never appeared in a horror movie, and she’s not a professional model. But she is the wife of Dmytro Konstantynov, a photographer working with stock images, posting his wares on Shutterstock since 2007.\n\nSo, against our better judgement, we’re taking it upon ourselves — and curse you, Felipe, may the evil woman of the dark haunt your dreams — we’re going to review all of these German/Euro-released movies that feature Maria Konstantynova on the cover. Now, Felipe gave a “special thanks” to his filmmaker friend René Wiesner, whose own Facebook post regarding stock photos on DVD covers inspired the writing of Felipe’s article.\n\nWell, we’re sending you a very special curse, René. You’ve been warned. As if I don’t have enough crap movies to review. . . . Oh, well. Let’s unpack ’em (alphabetically). And this is a bit long of an unpack: so bookmark us and come back as your one-stop Maria Konstantynova movie source!\n\nThe Films:\n\nAbsentia (2011)\n\nClowntown (2016)\n\nThe Hillside Stranglings (2004)\n\nHorror Cuts (2012)\n\nThe Levenger Tapes (2013)\n\nA Night in the Woods (2011)\n\nNightThrist (2004)\n\nThe Possession of Sophie Love (2013)\n\nReturn of Killer Shrews (2012)\n\nRoadkill (2011)\n\nMore Films:\n\nAtomic Shark (2016)\n\nAttack of the Killer Ants (2019)\n\nFrames of Fear 2 (2018)\n\nThe Hospital (2013)\n\nMartyrs (2015)\n\nAbsentia (2011)\n\nRemember Mike Flanagan and his box office hit, Oculus (2013)? Well, he made his writing and directing bones with star Katie Parker, later of Doctor Sleep (2019), in this Euro-clip artfest. However, unlike most of the films on this list featuring Maria Konstantynova on the cover: this is a well-made, Lovecraftian-styled horror of shadows and inferring and little-to-no shock scares.\n\nA widowed woman (Courtney Bell) and her drug-addicted sister (Parker) discover the link between a mysterious subway tunnel to a series of disappearances — including that of her own husband: after seven years, he’s “Dead in Absentia.” Sure, it’s not as great as Oculus, but Flanagan’s class and style — on a meager $75,000 budget, mind you — is shining through, leaving you knowing he’s moving on to something bigger.\n\nA highly-suggested watch on Tubi.\n\nClowntown (2016)\n\nAs with the recent, pretty decent Clown Fear (2020): The Texas Chainsaw Massacre is the retro-model, here, getting a coat of colorful, facial grease paint, sans any skin masks. Okay, maybe Wes Craven’s The Hills Have Eyes is the mold. Okay, well, maybe these guys grew up with Rob Zombie’s take on the material, aka House of a 1000 Corpses. Anyway, the “guys” in this case are Ohio filmmaker Tom Nagel directing his brother Brian in their feature film debut (next up for the duo was 2018’s The Toybox).\n\nUgh. Without the prattle of the plethora of other “killer clown” movies, this is a lesson in pure boredom and predictability — rife with awful acting and cheap gore — as a group of friends are stranded in the ubiquitous, deserted small town populated by a gang of psychopaths dressed as clowns.\n\nSee it under the Tubi Big Top!\n\nThe Hillside Stranglings, aka The Hillside Strangler (2004)\n\nIn the never-ending quest to squeeze every last Euro out of a U.S.-made TV movie in the overseas marketplace: there’s Maria Konstantynova giving new life to a film that deserves not.\n\nSure, the tutelage of C. Thomas Howell (The Outsiders) and Nicholas Turturro (brother of John and of the currently on-the-air U.S. TV series Chicago P.D) starring as Bianchi and Buono led me to rent The Hillside Strangler (2004). However, regardless of its claims of being “a more accurate portrayal,” in the shadow of the stellar quality of Crenna’s 1989 TV movie The Case of the Hillside Strangers, this direct-to-video leftoverture left me feeling that this Howell-fronted version worked as a fictional piece — not an accrate serial killer biography — plotted around two (dark) historical figures.\n\nSo, yeah, don’t be duped by the “Producers of Ed Gein and Bundy” tagline: those films are just as low-budget and dopey-pathetic in their aftermarket tedium. The “Palisades Tartan Extreme” banner that’s not on the U.S. version? Uh, well, the U.S. version isn’t “extreme” in the least, so we’re guessing the overseas cut offers graphic, U.S.-delete scenes? Whatever, eh, it’s still better than most of the U.S. junk Maria’s shilling within the Deutschland borders.\n\nWatch it on Amazon. Yikes, there’s a lot of C.Thomas Howell flicks on Tubi, just not this one. C.Tom’s okay, so make a day of it!\n\nHorror Cuts: Bitches, Satans and Hellraisers (2012)\n\nWhat “Doctor Death” is presenting here is four overseas, never-issued-in-the-U.S. horror films in a one-pack: Ugly Bitches (could be Crazy Bitches from 2014), Prince of Darkness (we think it’s Amir El Zalam from 2002), Walking the Dead (2010), and Frankenstein (your guess is as good as ours).\n\nIt’s not listed on the IMDb, but we found a DVD copy on Amazon, if you dare. But wait . . . the run time is only one hour seventeen minutes? So, it’s none of the films, noted above . . . but four short films cobbled on one DVD. Perhaps one of our German readers can clue us in as to what’s under the Maria Konstantynova cover.\n\nIf you find it on streaming platforms, let us know.\n\nThe Levenger Tapes (2013)\n\nIf the word “tape” doesn’t give it away: we’re dealing with another witch of the Blair variety. As with the later, Roadkill, below: we have three college kids (Johanna Brady of U.S. TV’s Quantico and Lili Mirojnick of Cloverfield, if you care) heading out into the woods — to look for a fabled cemetery — near one of the friend’s parents’ mountain home. Of course, the cameras are rolling, but instead of witch: they run into criminals-on-the-run . . . and vanish.\n\nThe always-welcomed Chris Mulkey (going way back to The Killing of Randy Webster and Act of Love) — who always deserves better than direct-to-video drek — is the detective watching the tapes to solve the boring mystery. And is it ever boring. Oh, is it ever.\n\nYou can fight the Zzzzzzzz on Tubi or as a PPV on You Tube to avoid the spot-load.\n\nA Night in the Woods (2011)\n\nUgh, more “found footage” triffle? Yep, this British version of The Blair Witch Project tells the tale of Brody, his gal Kerry, and bud Leo as they go-a-campin’ in the haunted sticks of the legendary Wistman’s Woods outside the village of Dartmoor. Love triangles ensue as the wood’s ancient evil — yes, a witch — shows up to add to the terror.\n\nFour Stars, you say?\n\nWell, I must have watched the wrong movie: this is amateurish and boring with bad-everything. Even more so than the previous Blair-inspired snooze-fest. Oh, our fair Maria, Queen of the Crawling Dark, you deserve a better clip-art’in than this ultra low-budget British horror mess.\n\nWatch it on Tubi, mate!\n\nNight Thirst (20??)\n\nHey, your guess is as good as ours.\n\nNight Thirst is obviously an alternate, Euro-overseas title to another film that doesn’t populate on the IMDb, Letterboxd, or Amazon. Google searches take us back to . . . well, Felipe M. Guerra’s original article that started this streaming torture chamber to hell in the first place.\n\nEh, it’s all par for the digital greens when chintzy studio shingles pack their wares by way of stock photo-manipulating art departments failing to list actors on the cover to make our research, easier. Again, we defer to our German readers (and as it turns out, French readers) to clear it up. If you find the film on DVD or streaming, let us know.\n\nUpdate: November 7, 2021: From the “We Again Bow to Felipe M. Guerra’s Research Department“: Turns out the title of this film is NightThirst, aka NighThrist, — stylized as one word with the “T” capitalized. No wonder we couldn’t track it down. . . . So, as Felipe pointed out: “NightThrist is a movie released, here [France], an SOV production where most of the budget must have been used to buy Maria’s stock photo!” While released in France in 2002, it was released in the U.S. in 2004 . . . and by the way: You know the “shot-on-video” genre is our B&S jam: it’s why it has its own category at the site.\n\nSo, anyway: Felipe sends us the IMDb link. We open the link. We scream in glee and bounce off the walls and run outside and swing off the girders of the Monongahela’s Smithfield Street Bridge — it’s a Mark and John Polonia and Brett Piper co-production, who shoot their films in our home state (and throughout the Northeastern U.S., mostly in New Hampshire). Yes!\n\nIf you know our site, you know how we roll down the Polonia-Piper confluence: We did a “Drive-In Friday: Brett Piper Night” of his films. As for the Polonia Brothers? Forget about it! We’ve done Empire of the Apes (2013), Amityville Death House (2015), Amityville Exorcism (2017), Revolt of the Empire of the Apes (2017), Amityville Island (2020), Camp Blood 8 (2020), Return to Splatter Farm (2020), Shark Encounters of the Third Kind (2020), and Jurassic Shark 2: Aquapocalypse (2021).\n\nCalm down, R.D. Could you tell us the plot?\n\nWell, we have to take into account the Polonia shingle was just starting out nineteen years ago and is only thirteen films into their insane 60-plus SOV-resume. As with the above Horror Cuts: our absolute sweet Maria is swilling another omnibus film of four tales: “Terror,” “Tag,” “Demon Forest,” and “Christmas in July” wrapped-around by a stranded tow-truck driver, “Van Roth” (our director Jon McBride of Cannibal Campout and Woodchipper Massacre; both 1988), who ends up at a remote county home to hear the tales.\n\nAgain, we say to the clip-art Art Department: Could you have at least put: “From the director of Cannibal Campout and Woodchipper Massacre” and “Featuring special effects by Brett Piper of Mysterious Planet” on the sleeve? How difficult and costly could adding that bit o’ 12-point courier font, be?\n\nSorry, streaming masochist: Amazon, FShare, Tubi, and You Tube come up dry. But why am I having a premonition I’ll find this in the cut-out $1.00 DVD bins at Big Lots or Dollar Tree . . . stay tuned.\n\nOkay, were is my lithium to calm my Piper-Polonia OCD . . . oh, shite . . . another episode of compulsion!\n\nUpdate: November 14, 2021: From the “Maria Konstantynova is the Gift that Keeps on Giving Department“: It turns out our good friends at Wild Eye Entertainment are “the chintzy shingle” (Sorry! The studio did most of the Polonia flicks, noted above) responsible for the NighThirst art. The studio created the art for a French movie they acquired, named Nightshot . . . and the producer felt our sweet Maria (are you nuts?) “did not fit his movie,” (yes she does!), so Wild Eye scrapped the art work. Around that same time, Wild Eye acquired Mark Polonia’s NighThrist for Amazon Digital and needed art, quickly — so the studio temporarily repurposed the rejected Nightshot art work. NighThrist was available on Amazon Digital for about six months. According to Wild Eye, Polonia Entertainment’s horror omnibus NighThrist will be re-released to streaming and DVD with proper artwork in the future.\n\nAs for the France-produced Night Shot, aka Nightshot (2018): Sure enough, there it is on the IMDb with 20 user (English) reviews. Knock yourself out. For when you disrespect Maria, your film shall not be reviewed, here. Figure it out for yourself, ye Shakespeare: to stream or not to stream, that is the question.\n\nThanks to the Wild Eye gang for being good sports. Now, back to the celluloid craptacular.\n\nThe Possession of Sophie Love (2013)\n\nUgh, more Brit direct-to-video junk. Why, Maria? Why do you hate me so?\n\nBritish low-budget auteur Philip Gardiner has written 57 movies and directed 105 — most are direct-to-video documentaries (on Hitler, Nostradamus, a few on The Bible, and Knights Templar), but there’s some horror and sci-fi in there, with the direct-to-DVD streamer likes of Robot Planet and The Killing Floor.\n\nSo, we have Jimmy, interning to become a psychologist, interviewing the teen-but-locked-up-in-a-child’s-home Sophie for his video thesis project at college. Turns out, Sophie had a happy home life, but blacked out, woke up, and found her mum n’ dad — dead. Yeah . . . Sophie soon sprouts a few different voices as the pea soup flies. And in some video quarters: Sophie’s last name is Lee, not Love. So go figure.\n\nThere’s no streams on Tubi or Amazon, but yikes . . . the You Tube trailer looks bad, as in awful. So, do you really need to see this? Do ya, huh? Do ya? No, really. Do you?\n\nReturn of the Killer Shrews, aka Mega Rats (2012)\n\nEver wondered where the Syfy Channel got the inspiration for their Sharknado franchise and every other film preceded by “Mega” in the title? Well, you may have never seen 1959’s The Killer Shrews, but here’s the sequel to get you up to speed.\n\nFifty-three years after being attacked by killer shrews on a remote island, Captain Thorne Sherman (James Best returning from the 1959 original) is hired by a reality television crew to return to the island. Since Ken Curtis (Festus from U.S. TV’s long-running Gunsmoke) passed away in 1991, the always-welcomed Bruce Davison (of the rat-famed original, Willard — yuk, yuk) takes on the role of Sherman’s sidekick, Jerry Farrell. Upping the I-want-to-watch quotient is Best’s Dukes of Hazzard TV-castmates in John Schneider and Rick Hurst.\n\nWhile the original was good clean, snowy UHF-TV fun — with its coon hounds dressed in fur and fake fangs as giant shrews (a small insectivorous mammal resembling a mouse) — the CGI rats this go-around . . . well, just overlook it all and just enjoy James Best, once again, carrying a film.\n\nYou can watch it as a PPV on You Tube.\n\nRoadkill (2011)\n\nAre you a fan of Lake Placid 3, Resident Evil: Afterlife, and I Spit on Your Grave 3? Then you’ll enjoy seeing British actress Kacey Clarke (of the long-running British series Grange Hill and The Inbetweeners) in this Ireland-shot, 24th entry in the “Maneater Series” made by RHI Entertainment for the SyFy Channel. You say you want to see all of the films in the series? Their Wikipage has the full listing.\n\nActually, Roadkill is not all that bad and the $2 million spent on the film shows on screen, and Stephen Rea (the Brit rock flick, Still Crazy, V for Vendetta, an Oscar-nod for The Crying Game) shows up . . . but didn’t I see this all before with Stephen King’s Thinner?\n\nLet me explain: Kacey and her three friends travel the Irish countryside in an R.V., they steal a small town’s cherish medallion, then hit an old woman; she unleashes a Roc: the mythical bird of the cover (clipped art from who knows where and pasted-in with our sweet Maria), that hunts them down one by one. See? Thinner, only without the weight loss.\n\nGive it a try with a slice of Strawberry pie, on You Tube.\n\nOh, no! There’s more? Who is she?\n\nFelipe M. Guerra also tracked down the reuse of the above photo. So, curse him, again, as we’re going to review those movies — the celluloid masochists that we are — as well.\n\nFelipe also managed to contact the photographer responsible for the image; this time the photographer didn’t want to comment on the photo’s use. It’s since been removed from Shutterstock’s image bank.\n\nOy. Let’s unpack this quintet of films.\n\nAtomic Shark, aka Saltwater (2016)\n\nOy, those Digital Content Managers of the IMDb are on the ball: This chum-epic is listed twice: as the TV movie Saltwater and the direct-to-DVD Atomic Shark. Ah, but the casts are totally different in each film. But wait . . . why is U.S. TV actor David Faustino in both, but Jeff Fahey — who we came to see — only appears in the first one, originally known as Saltwater? The first is directed by A.B Stone (Lake Placid vs. Anaconda, if you care), the latter film is by Lisa Palencia (Isis Rising: Curse of the Lady Mummy).\n\nArgh! What the hell is going on, here, besides this being another IMDb-film rife with fake cast and crew reviews rating their chum with “9s” and “10s” — as we apologize to our fellow German film lovers for its reissue in their Motherland.\n\nWell, as for Saltwater, aka Atomic Shark: When a lifeguard catches wind of a “dangerous anomaly” off the coast of San Diego — a radioactive shark (complete in glowing-red CGI) that causes bathers burst into flames — she commissions a band of unlikely heroes (Fahey and Faustino) to assist her on a suicide mission to save the west coast from total destruction. Now, according to the IMDB’er users: that is only the plot to A.B Stone’s, and not the plot to Lisa Palencia’s chum-opus. And sorry, Lisa. A.B’s was more than I could take. I am not watching your ode to radioactive selachimorpha.\n\nLook, Jeff Fahey and David Faustino are the ne’er-do-well heros, here, okay, so you decide. But be warned: it’s all cheap, poorly written, and overacted to the extreme. Did we learn nothing from Godzilla, folks? Quit atomic testing in the deep ocean waters.\n\nSorry, no streams, but the You Tube trailer . . . yikes. Why did you make me write about this, Maria? Why? Are you really that hot that I’ll endure bad films for you. Oh, hell yes, and a bag o’ chips.\n\nAngriff der Killerameisen, aka Attack of the Killer Ants (2019)\n\nAh, everything is new again in the overseas markets . . . as the U.S. Texas-made Invicta (Latin for “undefeated”), itself aka’in as Killer Ants in 2009 in some U.S. quarters, returns in Germany under a new title.\n\nOur young couple of Cory and Evan return to their roots in rural Texas to start a family. When Evan accepts a position as an English professor at the local college, the real nightmare begins for him and his entomologist wife: a fire ant plague sweeps across the Longhorn state. The ants, natch, aren’t made by Mother Nature, but by a mad scientist who employs Cory — out for the usual, trope-revenge on the town that scoffed at his research.\n\nOy! The bad effects. And Bad Sound. And Bad Acting. And Bad plotting. And there’s no budget. But the CGI ants aren’t bad, well, er, they’re not as awful as the rest of this mess. But seriously: Is the German entertainment industry so hard up that, instead of making their own movies, they’re reduced to redressing crappy American streamers?\n\nAren’t you glad we put in the effort to find a copy on Tubi? Well, are yah? Are yah? No, really? Are you?\n\nBrutality, aka Frames of Fear 2 (2018)\n\nJoin your host, Festering Frank, as he “returns from the grave” to bring you five more terrifying tales of blood-soaked horror of gory graveyards, mutated mothers, psycho Santas, and killer couples.\n\nOkay, then. Maybe if Maria Konstantynova starred in one of the vignettes?\n\nEh, you can find out for yourself on Tubi. Hey! We even found “Part 3”: Frames of Fear 3 (2021) on Tubi and Amazon! Nope, sorry. There’s no stream of the first one. That’s all on you to dig up. Watching “Part 2,” which I didn’t finish, was enough for me. Hey, I’m doin’ it all for you, Maria!\n\nThe Hospital (2013)\n\nOkay, so old St. Leopold’s Hospital has many urban legends surrounding it, but the residents of little ‘ol Bridgeport all agree on one thing: tortured souls roam its abandoned halls. Of course, the mystery proves too much for a pretty young student who decides to investigate the legend for her senior class project.\n\nOkay.\n\nApparently, writer and director Daniel Emery Taylor’s first installment did okay, since he made a sequel in 2015 — and he stars in both as the creepy Stanley Creech who haunts the halls. And they’re both on one German DVD two-pack to enjoy — Boy, Howdy!\n\nSorry, we can’t find any streams on Tubi or Amazon, but You Tube offers it as a PPV. But I don’t know . . . Oy, that trailer . . . to each his own. Again, do yah? No, really. Do you?\n\nMartyrs (2015)\n\nDid you see the well-received French-Canadian original from 2008?\n\nWell, if you did, that film makes this CGI’d American remake mess from the Annabelle and The Conjuring franchises team, even worse.\n\nYeah, if you witnessed the hopeless, art film darkness of Alexandre Aja’s New French Extreme hit, High Tension (2003), or Ryûhei Kitamura‘s brutal (Am I the only one who liked it?), serial-killer trope-upending, No One Lives (2012), then this remake will really disappoint. Sure, it’s not all awful, but it pales (and the violence is U.S.-lightened, of course) to the original. It’s all just so unnecessary, you know, like the U.S. Ju-On remake and endless sequels and reboots.\n\nHey, you don’t believe me? Rotten Tomatoes has it at 9% — and that’s nine percents too many, in my opinion.\n\nIt’s about a young girl escaping from her kidnapper’s lair, then struggling to fit in at the orphanage where she is sent. There, she makes friends with another abused orphan. Together, they seek out revenge on those who victimized and abused them.\n\nYou can watch it on Tubi. But seriously: stream the original, instead.\n\nAs Felipe pointed out in his article: Wouldn’t it be great if a filmmaker decides to explore the already popular faces of these stock photo-starlets and put them in a real horror movie — and not just on the cover.\n\nI’d pay to stream that movie.\n\nSpeaking of Jon McBride . . .\n\nComing late November 2021: a Jon McBride hootenanny!\n\n* Thanks to Felipe M. Guerra and René Wiesner for tracking down the one-sheets and video box art used in this article. We tip our hats and bow, sirs.\n\nYou see: Kind, constructive review-comments and contact-messages from our readers, filmmakers, and distributors creates wonderful content and makes the love of and writing of films, fun for all concerned.\n\nAbout the Author: You can visit R.D Francis on Facebook. He also writes for B&S About Movies.\n\nMy mother told me at a young age not to fuck with Ouija boards and as a result, I never have. I have, however, watched plenty of movies that feature the spirit board and I figured that since I haven’t seen an all-inclusive list online that I’d start one. If I missed any, please inform me!\n\nCurrently owned by Hasbro, Ouija is also known as a spirit board or talking board. It comes with a flat game board marked with the letters of the alphabet, the numbers 0–9 and the words yes, no, hello and goodbye. A heart-shaped piece of plastic is used in the game, which some Spiritualists claim is the real danger of the commercial Ouija, as plastic cannot confine spirits while wood can; this reminds me of my abortive attempt to play competitive Scrabble, which taught me that they play with plastic pieces that are smooth and unmarked to limit cheating.\n\nIt’s based on the types of boards that Spiritualists — one of the largest churches for Spiritualism is located right down the street from our old house — used to use in camps within Ohio. In fact, one of the first ads for the game showed up in the Pittsburgh Dispatch in February 1891.\n\nBut where did it come from? In an article in the Smithsonian, even researcher and the consultant for several Ouija-based movies Robert Murch, who has been studying the game for 28 years, says “For such an iconic thing that strikes both fear and wonder in American culture, how can no one know where it came from?”\n\nAt one point, communicating with the dead was just something that people did for fun. It wasn’t seen as Satanic or dabbling with the unknown. But now we have streaming services to entertain us, so we see these things as dangerous. The jury is out on whether or not they truly are.\n\nIn 1890, Charles Kennard, Elijah Bond and Col. Washington Bowie started the Kennard Novelty Company to exclusively make and market what they called Ouija boards. The name came from actually using the board, as a spirit told Bond’s sister-in-law, Helen Peters, to use it and that it meant “good luck.” They even got a patent, which needed as proof that the game worked. A patent officer asked for them to learn his name through the board. When it did, he signed off.\n\nUp until 1973, people saw the game as just that. A game. Sure, there were rumors of murders and all manner of authors — James Merrill even won the National Book Critics Circle Award for his Ouija-assisted poem The Changing Light at Sandover — but nobody was afraid of it. In fact, science even explained it away as the ideometer effect, something that I’ve seen The Amazing Keskin do in person by moving tables around the room with people unaware of how they’re doing it.\n\nThen came The Exorcist. And no scientific explanation would do, as religious groups began denouncing the demon boards and burning them on bonfires. Way to go, Regan.\n\nThe Exorcist (1973): How does a nice girl like Regan end up masturbating with a holy object and spitting pea spot in a priest’s face? Blame Ouija. Playing with the game, she learns that she can ask questions of Captain Howdy, who we all know better by his dream name, Pazuzu. As for writer Peter Blatty, he claimed in an interview that the game itself spooked him: “Well, I don’t want to sound like a nut but as I was writing the last chapter and the epilogue I did have a series of bizarre experiences. For the first time in my life I got hung up on a Ouija board for 10 days.\n\nI’d never done it before but I found I couldn’t leave it alone. And I had the most definite feeling that I was communicating with the dead. Yes, I agree an awful lot of it could be auto-suggestion, and I knew all about how Ouija boards worked because I’d researched it so much for the book, but there were certain things which are not susceptible to explanation by the subconscious mind.\n\nI thought it was my father communicating with me, and I got someone in to help validate the experience. She was a girl who could put herself into a self-imposed hypnotic trance and who would operate the planchette on the Ouija board. I didn’t touch it at all, and asked the questions in Arabic, which she didn’t understand a word of, and I got precisely the right answers.\n\nBut then I thought well maybe subconsciously I was formulating the answers in English and she was picking them up from me telepathically.\n\nBut then there were poltergeist experiences. Doing revision of the book at a friend’s house, the telephone rang and suddenly the receiver leapt off the hook. It happened to him first and then to me. So I asked a friend who did the acoustics for the Kennedy Center what the possibilities were electrically and he said it was impossible. Then telephone engineers in two states confirmed that it was impossible. But we both saw it happen. That was the culmination of several incidents, but it was the one that in no way could be explained.\n\nAn electric typewriter wrote a line of gibberish, but what do I know about electricity. Maybe there was a short circuit somewhere. That was possible.”\n\nThe Ouija is so tied to The Exorcist that a board even shows up in the 1990 parody Repossessed.\n\nHere’s the rest…\n\n13 Ghosts (1960): This William Castle film has a house packed with ghosts, a family trying to stay and find the fortune hidden there and even the Ghost Viewer gimmick, special glasses that allowed audiences to find hidden spirits. It was remade as Th13teen Ghosts, one of the silliest titles ever (and I blame Se7en for this).\n\n5 A.M. (2016): You have to love the conversational nature of this sales copy: “People say that nobody dares to play it. There’s a game played 5 minutes before midnight, and suddenly something comes up.” That something is the supernatural and that game is, you guessed it, Ouija.\n\nAleister (2015): Trust me, moving into a new home is scary. Moving into one that had a Satanic cult as its past residents — leaving behind a Ouija board — well, that’s worse.\n\nAlison’s Birthday (1981): Of all the movies on this list, perhaps this one is the most disquieting and well-made. Australian folk horror, outright occult energy and a Ouija-filled start that ends with the death of a teen? You want all of this. It’s on Tubi.\n\nAmerican Ouija (2011): Also known as 19 Doors, this movie finds a screenwriter heading to an abandoned hotel to write her next movie and finding a spirit board. It’s on Tubi.\n\nAmityville 3-D (1983): It’s bad enough that Lori Laughlin and Meg Ryan find themselves in the Amityville house, much less in 3D, when they decide to grab a Ouija board down out of the attic and play with it. They may as well have done drugs and had sex in the woods while they were making mistakes like that. PS: We have watched way too many Amityville movies.\n\nAmityville Emanuelle (2023): How someone could combine Amityville, Emanuelle and Ouija in one movie and still be boring is an incredible accomplishment.\n\nAnd You Thought Your Parents Were Weird (1991): In this kid-friendly movie, Josh and Max Carson spend their free time building a Newman, a robot that gets their father’s spirit thanks to Josh’s witchy new girlfriend. Is it on Tubi? You know it.\n\nAnomaly (2016): This is not a true story. I kind of admire that someone tried to sell it as one, but you know, “A ripoff of other movies that are maybe based on true stories” is not a great tagline. There is Ouija in it, at least.\n\nBlack Devil Doll (2007): I mean this is literally the sales copy from this movie: “What started as a simple child’s game has now become a fight for her life! What is this evil that she has summoned from beyond? And why does it have a fro? What kind of horrific acts will she be subjected to? And what price will her super-hot, half-nude friends have to pay?”\n\nBlood Night: The Legend of Mary Hatchet (2009):Danielle Harris plays Alissa, a girl obsessed with — and perhaps possessed by — the urban legend of a woman who killed an entire insane asylum and beheaded her rapist. If that’s the secret story of your hometown, maybe don’t use a spirit board on her grave.\n\nCharlie Chan’s Secret(1936): The tenth Charlie Chan features two seances, including one that gives away the killer. Yay Ouija!\n\nDeadly Messages (1985): This made-for-TV movie starts with a spirit board revealing a murder and leading TV movie queen Kathleen Beller dealing with murder, unbelieving cops and the ghost of a murdered young man. It’s directed by Jack Bender, who also made another great made-for-TV horror movie, The Midnight Hour.\n\nDeath Ouija (2014): In this Yi Wang-directed movie, a group of young people gather together at a deserted old building and, you know it, a spirit board kicks off the shenanigans. Guess what? The same thing happens in the 2017 sequel, Death Ouija 2.\n\nDemon Legacy (2014): As a teenager, I never realized that most sleepovers involve using Ouija to invoke dangerous demons. I thought it was mainly icing bras and talking about boys. Even better, the filmmakers claimed that after burning the prop Ouji board, a series of catastrophic events was unleashed, including a blizzard, a fire, a flood, sets being destroyed, loss of funding and loss of cast members. The producers actually had two spiritual advisers come in to fix everything.\n\nThe Devil’s Footprints: It’s a Wrap (2022): A group of friends decides to become members of a Satanic Brotherhood called the Underground Inferno and get hunted by the evil goth Moe. Why am I writing about this at 6 AM?\n\nDon’t Look Under the Bed (2010): In this short film, a Halloween night leads a teenager to a Ouija board and have you figured out the rest yet?\n\nDon’t Move (2013): In this short, a games night unleashes a demon that slices people — and their friendships — apart.\n\nDon’t Panic(1988): Also known A Maldição de Ouija, this movie has a hero who always wears dinosaur pajamas confronting an Ouija board-based villain on his eighteenth birthday. It’s a mix of Saved by the Bell and slasher films; it’s also either the worst or best movie you’ve ever seen. I err on the latter side of that question.\n\nDoor in the Woods (2019): The fine folks at Wild Eye were kind enough to remind me that there’s an Ouija moment in this one! You can check it out on Tubi.\n\nDrive Thru (2009): Horny the Clown speaks in all languages: murder, Magic 8 Ball and, for the needs of this list, the Ouija board.\n\nExorcism: The Possession of Gail Bowers (2006): Based on one of the true incidents that inspired The Exorcist — yeah right — a psychiatrist decides that science and medicine can no longer save his possessed daughter. This is on Tubi.\n\nExorcist: The Fallen (2014): A young girl and her family go through a horrifying reality while she becomes possessed by demonic forces. That description, I realize, could have been about any of these movies.\n\nGhost Team One (2013): Never underestimate just how badly men want laid, even if they must convince a gorgeous woman that their house is haunted.\n\nGreetings (2007): It’s Cathy’s party — not her curse — but sboys have found a Ouija board and are out for some harmless fun. Stop me, stop me, stop me, stop me, stop me if you’ve heard this one before.\n\nHaunted Tales (1980): A Shaw Brothers anthology of ghost stories seems like the perfect place to have a Ouija board show up.\n\nHaunter (2013): Abigail Breslin plays a ghost stuck with her family reliving the day that they were all murdered while trying to communicate with other realities.\n\nHoly Terror (2002): Encouraged to experiment with an Ouija board by their sinister landlord, a couple and their guests inadvertently unleash the murderous spirit of a demonic nun whose evil is so powerful that it cannot be contained. Watch it on Tubi.\n\nI Am ZoZo(2012): Released as Are You There?in the UK, this is all about five kids at a Halloween party who end up releasing a demon named ZoZo, who you may better know as Pazuzu. You can check this out on Tubi.\n\nInherent Vice(2014):The Ouija board does not always have to have horrific scenes built around it. Witness this Paul Thomas Anderson — son of horror host Ghoulardi — film!\n\nInsomnium(2017): How many times do we need to explain the rules of Ouija? You really only need one rule and that’s never play it alone. Add a cocktail of weed and booze to this and you have absolute lunacy.\n\nIs Anybody There?(2002): The film sets up three rules as its players use a spirit board: Rule #1: Never ask a spirit how he or she died. Rule #2: Never ask a spirit how you are going to die. Rule #3: Never stop playing without saying goodbye.\n\nIsland of Lost Souls(2007): A young girl dreams of a more magical world while dealing with the darkness inside her new home and the possession of her little brother.\n\nJu-on: White Ghost (2009): One of the characters in this movie plays Kokkuri — see Ouija Japan— which is a similar spirit divination game.\n\nLa trajinera del terror (2005): Yes, between this and Don’t Panic, the spirit board has found its way to Mexico. Two girls use one and then go all slasher all over their friends on an island vacation.\n\nLeft In Darkness(2006): A young woman, whose mother died giving birth to her, is facing eternal life in either Heaven or Hell. Turn to that good old spirit board for the answers.\n\nLong Time Dead (2002):Bad idea: a group of college students decide to try their hands at a seance by using a homemade Ouija board. As I will say on and on in this list, in every country — even Britain — this is a bad idea.\n\nMalefic (2003): It’s bad enough when ransomers try to make money off a dead girl. They probably should have left the Ouija alone after that.\n\nMerlin’s Shop of Mystical Wonders (1996): This movie features cursed objects and we can’t think of too many other things that get as bad of a name as the Ouija board. Except monkeys with cymbals. One of them is in this as well.\n\nMortal Ouija (2019): Seven days after you play Ouija, it goes all Ringu on you. I never heard of that rule before. Also, the theme song to this movie is not the Mortal Kombat song with Ouija substituted.\n\nMother’s Day (1980): Amongst all the other horrifying behavior in this movie, you may have missed the spirit board. Well, its there.\n\nNecromentia (2009): It’s one thing to own a spirit board. It’s an even bigger commitment to have one tattooed on your back. Also: a movie that theorizes that ketamine use allows you to meet demons.\n\nOnly You (1994): Yes, sometimes romcoms also have Ouija boards in them. This time around, one of them inspires Marisa Tomei to keep looking for romantic love. Shout out to my buddy Hoss who was one of the students in Tomei’s classroom when he was but a teen.\n\nOuija (2014): Hasbro goes Blumhouse, bringing along the writers of The Possession and getting Lin Shaye to show up as teenagers get out of control with a spirit board. Nothing in this movie would sell you on the toy company’s product, which amazes me that they ever let this happen.\n\nOuija: Deadly Reunion (2021):Also known as Ouija Warehouse, this has that old move that starts so many a spirit board movie: well, we found one at a party and starting using it and…\n\nOuija: Game Never Ends (2015): I’ve been writing this list for nearly a year and trust me, this title is triggering. A Kannada supernatural horror film shot in Malaysia and Bangalore, this one has a unique concept: some software writers decide to make a movie and make the mistake of having it be about Ouija.\n\nOuija: Origin of Evil (2016): The sequel to the official Ouija movie was written and directed by Dr. Sleep‘s Mike Flanagan. It’s a definite improvement over the first one, telling the story of a family that has a fake seance business that attracts a real spirit.\n\nOuija: The Awakening (2013): You have to admire the balls of the makers of this film, who made sure to\n\nOuija: The Awakening of Evil (2017): Man, awakening and Ouija go together like Bud Spencer and Terrence Hill. This time, a group of teenagers play with a Ouija board and awaken something truly evil and unstoppable. I bet it’s the horrible poster art!\n\nOuija Blood Ritual (2020): How insidious! A combination of the found footage and Ouija film? Oh man — that poster is making me, coercing me to find and watch this! I’m possessed.\n\nOuija Board (2004): Also known as Bunshinsaba, this movie finds a group of teen outcasts using their spirit board to curse the popular kids. Man, you can do that? What was I doing in high school?\n\nOuija Craft (2020): After a member of their coven dies, a group of witches bring her back with the Ouija which is the worst idea amongst the many bad ideas on this list. You can watch this on Tubi.\n\nOuija Death Trap (2014): A teen reunites with her former school friends and has them visit her haunted job and bring a Ouija board. The poster is bold enough to say, “Based on the chilling urban legend.”\n\nOuijageist (2018): A single mom finds a board in the backyard that’s already killed six people. You know exactly what happens. Or you can watch this on Tubi.\n\nOuija House (2018): A graduate project leads to a Ouija-board nightmare. You can watch this on, you guessed it, Tubi. They should just call that streaming service Ouija TV.\n\nOuija Mummy (2019): What a title! Well, that’s what happens when you play Ouija with your friends. You get possessed by an Egyptian goddess. Hey! It’s on Tubi!\n\nOuija Possession (2015): After finding a vintage spirit board in their parents’ basement, a group of teens conjure an undead relative, who stalks them from beyond the grave. We get to watch on Tubi.\n\nOuija Room (2019): This one has an interesting hook: What if an agoraphobic woman with autism needs friends when her caretaker is working during the say, so she starts using a Ouija board? You don’t have to ask the board if this is on Tubi.\n\nOuija Seance: The Final Game (2000): If you get the opportunity to spend a weekend in a haunted house, maybe don’t play Ouija. That will put you many steps closer to success than anyone else on this list. You can watch this on Tubi.\n\nOuija Shark (2020): Yeah, it’s on Tubi, but this movie has the best name ever and if you look at this single frame, you can decide whether or not you’re ready for it. There’s also Ouija Shark 2.\n\nOuija 3: The Charlie Charlie Challenge (2016): An eccentric haunted house owner invites a group of hapless teens over to play the terrifying game known as Charlie Charlie. Guess what? This isn’t a sequel just a retitled movie called Charlie Charlie. Based on the terrifying urban legend and playing on the ad-filled Tubi.\n\nOuija 4 (2018): Man, the Italians would have loved all these Ouija movies that keep moving country of origin and play fast and loose with the numbers. They’d also have loved Tubi, right?\n\nParanormal Activity (2009) and Paranormal Activity 2 (2010): I think everyone that reads this site knows how I feel about found footage movies, so I’ll reserve my usual bile and just stick to the facts. This one has a major Ouija scene, where a board catches on fire after reaching whatever is causing all of the hijinks in this movie. If you’re really bored, there’s also a 2013 softcore parody movie called Paranormal Whacktivity.\n\nThe Possession Diaries (2019): College student Rebecca Clarkson documents on her webcam how playing with a Ouija board slowly allows for a demon to possess her. On Tubi, where else?\n\nPrison of the Dead (2000): This David DeCoteau-directed film — which also shows up in the Full Moon portmanteau Horrific— is about a group of post-teens playing with an Ouija board in an abandoned witches’ prison. This raises the executioners from the dead and it gets all Shakespearian — everyone pretty much dies.\n\nRepossessed (1990): My vow to never play Ouija can only be broken by one person: Linda Blair. I will scream her dream name at the top of my lungs whenever you want.\n\nRevival of Evil (1980): As a school child in the midst of the Satanic Panic, I was forced to watch movies like this. Decades later, I’m in the middle of writing an article about Ouija boards and can quote Anton Lavey any time you’d like. Maybe all that Dungeons and Dragons was a good thing.\n\nSatan’s Blood (1978): This movie promises Satan, sin and sex and it delivers. I mean, it starts with a bunch of hooded worshippers all over a girl before they stab her with a big ceremonial blade. Some prints even start with a professor warning viewers of the dangers of Satanism! And yes, a Ouija board has to be involved after that.\n\nSatanic (2006):Angus Scrimm and Jeffrey Combs are both in this story of a girl who wakes up from a car accident with no memory of what happened and — even worse — everyone around her dying.\n\nSéance (2006): As five students remain behind at a university over Thanksgiving, they try to use an Ouija board to release the ghost of a girl that haunts them and end up bringing her killer back as well.\n\nSeance: The Summoning (2011): Some friends break into a morgue — a morgue, I tell you! — to play Ouija and are shocked when things go wrong. Hell yeah it’s on Tubi.\n\nSeytan (1974): If you’re going to make a movie that’s the Turkish Exorcist, you need “Tubular Bells” and a Ouija board. That’s the union rules. Thanks for playing along.\n\nSimon Says(2019): After cleaning up from their Halloween party, some friends decide to play Ouija and things work out just as you’d expect. What you may not expect is that this was a 48 hour film made for the Detroit 48 Hour Film Project.\n\nSinister Circle(2016): A skeptical psychologist was part of a tragedy in the past wager several teens died after playing Ouija. Now, she goes back home and we all know, in a horror movie, you should never go home again.\n\nSorority House Massacre 2: Nighty Nightmare (1990): You knew that sooner or later, a Jim Wynorski sequel slasher would end up on this list. The sorority sisters in this movie have no excuse for what happens to them after they contact the killer Hockstatter — who is kinda sorta the loose sequel same character as the killer in Sorority House Massacre— and bring him back to reality.\n\nSpirits of the Glass (2004): You know, I hate vacations. I would absolutely scream at you if you started playing Ouija on my hated vacation in this movie and its sequel Spirit of the Glass 2: The Hunted.\n\nSpirit Trap(2005): Nobody ever listens, but if you get the chance to move into a crumbling mansion with a spirit clock inside the walls, just don’t.\n\nSpookies (1984): Oh my most loved movie, Spookies you don’t let us down with your Ouija scene that sets everything off on the path to baffling heck. I mean, a demon girl is running the board. That should tell you all you need to know. If you haven’t seen this movie, your life has been a failure.\n\nStupid Teenagers Must Die! (2006): At last, a movie that understands that if you go to a haunted house and have a Ouija board, you deserve whatever is coming next.\n\nTape 13 (2014): More found footage, more dumb explorers into the unknown. You know what happens when you screw with the unknown? Your story ends up on Amazon Prime. But not Tubi. Somehow, this is not on Tubi and that’s the most unsettling fact on this list.\n\nTerror Toons (2002): Much like Evil Toons, this movie has adult stars — former Extreme girl Lizzie Borden and Beverly Lynn (who only acted in non-porn softer films) — playing Strip Ouija, which is a thing.\n\nThe Bat Whispers(1930): A Ouija board shows up in this film that was the direct inspiration for the creation of Batman.\n\nThe Black Waters of Echo’s Pond(2009): Robert Patrick and Danielle Harris — battling Ouija again — are the names that get you to rent this movie about a house where a family finds the Ouija board that brings out the worst in all of themselves. Directed by Gabriel Bologna, my, my, my, woo, my bologna!\n\nThe Blood Stained Shadow(1978): A town full of sinners, a fake medium with a spirit board, a Goblin soundtrack and murders in the tall grass? Yeah, this might be the best Ouija film on this list.\n\nThe Chill Factor (1993): If you get snowed in to a deserted summer camp — and you find a Ouija board — don’t play it. That’s my advice.\n\nThe Conjuring 2 (2016):Somehow, this movie is at once an Ouija movie, a possession movie, an Amityville movie and a movie about situations based on the real-life event Enfield Poltergeist…and a Christmas movie!\n\nThe Exorcism of Emily Rose(2005): Based on the story of Anneliese Michel, this tells the story of a priest accused of murder after a possession ends up costing the life of a possessed girl. Of course a spirit board figures in. German director Hans-Christian Schmid made a similar movie called Requiemand there’s another film called Anneliese: The Exorcist Tapesthat you can find on Tubi.\n\nThe Ouija Board (1920): As you can see, Ouija boards have been frightening people on film for over a hundred years. This one has animator Max Fleischer drawing his famous Koko character and a haunted house while another animator and a janitor get in Ouija hijinks.\n\nThe Ouija Exorcism (2013): Look, if you’re a famous exorcist and capture a demon in a spirit board, maybe keep it away from your kids. Somehow, the artwork in all of these films are so similar I worry at times if I am possessed and just watch them all in a drone-like state waiting to be filled with a demonic spirit myself.\n\nThe Ouija Experiment (2013): The title doesn’t lie. A bunch of friends film an experiment with a spirit board. If things went well, we wouldn’t have the sequel The Ouija Experiment 2: Theater of Death, which is also known as The Ouija Resurrection.\n\nThe Ouija Summoning (2015): Also known as You Will Kill, this has a woman getting possessed by her board. If you want to make your own Ouija movie, you can use that very same sentence as your pitch.\n\nThe Pact (2012): Director Nicholas McCarthy struggled for nearly a decade to break into movies before this success, which features a homemade board that is the catalyst for all Hell breaking loose late in the film.\n\nThe Possession Experiment(2016): Movies where people are possessed after using the spirit board are all over this list. This one may be the only movie where the person wants to be taken.\n\nThe Power (1984): Four teens research a cursed Aztec idol in a graveyard with the Ouija and wouldn’t you know it, everything goes bad?\n\nThe Spirit Board (2016): A seance gone wrong, you say? Who has heard of such a thing!\n\nThe Uninvited (1944): 29 years before The Exorcist, this Lewis Allen film became one of the first movies to depict ghosts as legitimate entities rather than illusions or misunderstandings played for comedy. As such, it has a seance scene that features the Ouija board.\n\nThe Unleashed (2011): The poster literally says “Space for a quote up here.” That’s how much care when into this tale of…say it with me…a seance gone wrong and a girl with a dark past being possessed. Hey, Caroline Williams is in it!\n\nThe White Cat (1950): In this Swedish movie, a man comes to Stockholm and all he knows is his phone number. A waitress tries to help him, which seems like the perfect use for a spirit board.\n\nTwixt (2011): How is no one discussing that Francis Ford Coppola wrote and directed a horror film about how dreams impact our existence and bring us ideas? Beyond the Ouija board, this movie also has a machine that puts stakes into the hearts of vampires and is narrated by Tom Waits.\n\nTwo Witches (2021): In this two-part tale of modern witches, the spirit board figures into the first tale of a woman given the evil eye.\n\nVeronica(2017): Based on the 1991 Vallecas case where Estefanía Gutiérrez Lázaro died mysteriously after she used the game, this Spanish film was sold as “the most frightening movie on Netflix.”\n\nYou have to love that so many of these movies are sold with that kind of hype. Or say, from one of the producers. Or someone that worked on. These movies are the 2021 versions of the video rental store is closing and you need to grab a movie before you get thrown out, so you look for anything to get your attention.\n\nWays to Live Forever(2010): Sam loves facts. I mean, not me, but he kid in this movie who is obsessed by all sorts of weird things like horror movies, UFOs and Ouija boards. Hey wait a second…\n\nWeedjies: Halloweed Night(2019): “When a midnight scavenger hunt for a rare bud of weed known as the Golden Nug brings a group of party-hungry stoners to a haunted hotel, it seems like it’ll be the greatest night ever. But when the enigmatic owner, Madam Haze, introduces them to the Weed-G-Board, they open a portal beyond our world, and unleash The Weedjies.” Full Moon, I wish I could quit you.\n\nWhat Lies Beneath (2000): Along with being one of the few — SPOILER WARNING FOR A TWENTY-YEAR-OLD MOVIE — films that I can think of where Harrison Ford plays the bad guy, there’s a scene where heroine Claire Spencer (Michelle Pfeiffer) and psychic best friend Jody (Diana Scarwid, Christina in Mommie Dearest) uses an Ouija board.\n\nWitchboard (1986): Starting with the Tawny Kitaen-starring original and going across two more films, 1993’s Witchboard 2: The Devil’s Doorway and 1995’s Witchboard III: The Possession, the board that sees all and knows all causes all manner of possessed events to befall its characters. If you’re going to watch these, I’d advise sticking with the first one, which is on Tubi.\n\nYes, No, Goodbye (2018): A group of filmmakers embark on the road trip of a lifetime to explore the occult, the Bible Belt and all things Ouija.\n\nAberrations (2012): In this anthology film, a novelist uses a Ouija board to steal ideas from a dead writer.\n\nOuija Nazi (2014): Also known as Nazi Dawn, this is all about a group of sorority girls who take their new pledge Dawn to a country estate and end up awakening the spirit of her great-grandfather, the Nazi Van Holly, with a Ouija board. I mean, the board is in it for a minute.\n\nDemonoids from Hell (2023): Two young women move into a new apartment, invite over their boyfriends Thomas (and find a Ouija board. You know what they should do, right? Throw that thing away. But instead, they use it and unleash three small demonoids who, from the poster, are definitely an even lower budget version of Ghoulies.\n\nThere are tons of Ouija movies, as you can see above, so if you have one that we didn’t find, please let us know and we’ll add it to the list!\n\nYou can check our Letterboxd list out and comment there as well.\n\nThis is the final segment of our three-part series. We’ve discovered 33 films in the series, with 11 films each over the past three days — at 3 PM — as part of our third “Rock ‘n’ Roll Week” installment.\n\nThe films are listed by year of release.\n\nNowhere Boy (2009)\n\nImagine This: Growing Up With My Brother John Lennon by Lennon’s half-sister Julia Baird fuels this tale. Sam Taylor-Johnson — who earned a Golden Raspberry nod for Worst Director on her sophomore film, Fifty Shades of Grey (2015) — makes her directorial debut with this examination of John Lennon’s (an excellent Aaron Taylor-Johnson) adolescence, his relationships with his aunt Mimi Smith, and his mother Julia Lennon, and the creation of his first band, the Quarrymen, and its evolution into the Beatles.\n\nLennon Naked (2010)\n\nAfter watching the early years of Lennon in Nowhere Boy, and one’s left wondering what the final year of Lennon’s life was like in the Beatles, this BBC-TV produced TV movie, which ended up on the U.S. pay cable network Showtime as a first-run movie, answers those questions. Christopher Eccleston as Lennon is excellent throughout; chilling, in fact.\n\nGeorge Harrison: Living in the Material World (2011)\n\nLook, Hollywood is too busy mucking up the histories of Elton John, Freddie Mercury, and Nikki Sixx to give “The Quiet Beatle” a bioflick or Netflix mini-series proper. Besides, when Martin Scorsese takes a break from the mobster flicks to pay tribute to the life and times of George Harrison, you break editorial rules and include the documentary on the list.\n\nThis is buoyed by Paul and Ringo showing up, along with Harrison’s widow Olivia, and his son Dhani, as well as Tom Petty and Eric Clapton. Not only do we learn about George’s time with the Beatles; the seven-years-in-the-making film delves deeply into his solo career, including his work with the Concert for Bangladesh and the delightful Traveling Wilburys project.\n\nAn interesting Harrison side-bar to pair with this documentary is Paul McCartney Really Is Dead: The Last Testament of George Harrison (2010), mockumentarian Joel Gilbert’s (Elvis Found Alive!) speculation on the urban legend that — via secret, rare tapes made by George Harrison, himself — Paul did, in fact, die in a 1966 car crash and was was replaced by a double.\n\nGood Ol’ Freda (2013)\n\nThe subject matter here is such an out-of-left field twist in the history of Beatles flicks, we had to break editorial policy for a third time to mention this fascinating documentary on the life of Fredy Kelly: a fellow Liverpudlian hired by Brian Epstein as the Beatles Fan Club secretary. What makes this all work is the lack of sensationalism, courtesy of Kelly’s humble soul in respecting the privacies of her world-famous friends, but still telling us many things we did not know.\n\nDanny Collins (2015)\n\nIn 1971, 21-year old Bristol, England, folk musician Steve Tilston released his critically acclaimed debut album, An Acoustic Confusion, and the 1972 sophomore follow up, Collection.\n\nIn a 1971 ZigZag magazine interview, Tilston admitted — inspired by the editor/writer’s accolades for Tilson’s work — that he feared wealth and fame might negatively affect his songwriting.\n\nInspired, John Lennon wrote to Tilston — in care of ZigZag — to offer the upcoming musician encouragement, “. . . Being rich doesn’t change your experience in the way you think,” Lennon wrote. It was signed, “Love, John and Yoko.” It turned out that, upon receipt of the letter, the magazine’s editor, believing Lennon’s letter “had value,” greedily kept the document; it was never turned over to Tilston.\n\nHow wicked the Fates: If the Lennon letter had been turned over to Tilston, would he and Lennon have forged a friendship? Would Lennon’s words have encouraged Tilston not to give up on the music business?\n\nTilston did not become aware of the letter’s existence until 2005, when a collector contacted him to verify the document’s authenticity. When the story was officially reported in the music trades in August 2010, it inspired this 2015 Al Pacino-starring film.\n\nWhile the movie has it charms, and Pacino is endearing as a non-folkie, but poppy-ersatz Neil Diamond (check out the great original, “Hey, Baby Doll,” which was purposely crafted as a Diamond soundalike to “Sweet Caroline”), the excitement over a movie with such an obscure Beatles connection quickly fades due to us being treated to a film “based on Steve Tilston’s life” and not about Steve Tilston.\n\nNo, we don’t see Lennon or Yoko, either.\n\nThe Lennon Report (2016)\n\nPair this Beatles flick with either of the Mark David Chapman flicks to learn of the aftermath of Chapman’s motives. It purports to be the “true story” of the moments after John Lennon was shot. Lennon’s murder is seen through eyes of a young news producer poised to break the biggest story of the year, and the emergency room staff of Roosevelt Hospital realizing the true identity of their “John Doe,” and their race against time to save his life, all the while keeping his identity, private.\n\nEight Days a Week — The Touring Years (2017)\n\nOkay, so we’re doing Ron Howard solid by mentioning his documentary because of his rock flick pedigree with the very cool NBC-TV movie Cotton Candy (1978). Howard explores the Beatles’ touring years and answers the questions as to why they stopped touring in 1966 to focus solely on recording in the studio. It’s expertly assembled, as expected with a Ron Howard production, and well worth the watch — even for those who eschew documentaries of any subject.\n\nPaul Is Dead (2018)\n\nPaul McCartney didn’t die in a car crash, as commonly rumored, in this comedic “What If . . .” flick. And he wasn’t murdered by Billy Shears, either. Paul simply died from a drug overdose during an experimental, countryside musical retreat — the drugs were George’s — and replaced by the look-alike, local sheep herder, Billy Shears.\n\nYou can learn more about the film and free-stream it on the film’s official website, or watch it on Vimeo. There’s also two, wonderful fiction books that play with the myth of Billy Shears: The Memoirs of Billy Shears (2018) by Thomas E. Uharriet, and Billy Shears: The Secret History of the Beatles (2020) by Bruce “Doctor” Lev. Either book would make for a wonderful feature film.\n\nScrambled Eggs (2019)\n\nProduced as part of the U.K.’s SKY Network’s Emmy Award-nominated series Urban Myths, the installments delve into fictionalized stories about the legends of the acting and music industries. Writer Simon Nye (who also wrote the Season 2/Episode 8 installment, “The Sex Pistols vs. Billy Grundy“) weaves this tale (Season 3/Episode 7) based on interviews Paul McCartney has given over the years about how he developed the melody to “Yesterday.” In comical twist: Paul is so dumbfounded that he came up such a mature melody, he drives everyone crazy over his paranoid that he “stole” the melody from another, popular song.\n\nYou can learn more about the Urban Myths series at Sky.com. You can also stream it on U.S shores via Showtime and Hulu. You can also stream the full 20-minute film on You Tube and sample the film with its highlights reel.\n\nYesterday (2019)\n\nSo, was it worth shelling $10 million dollars for the rights to the Beatles’ catalog in this Richard Curtis-penned romantic comedy (Love Actually and The Boat that Rocked) directed by Danny Boyle (Oscar-winner Slumdog Millionaire, Trainspotting)?\n\nYes. We said “romantic comedy.” Yes, by Richard Curtis, who gave us Bridget Jones movies and hooked up the likes of Hugh Grant and Julia Roberts in Notting Hill.\n\nAnd “the Beatles” . . . well, an actor portraying John Lennon (John Lennon scene/You Tube) shows up. But he’s not the “John Lennon” we know: he lives a quite, non-musical life as an artist (at the age of 78) in a beach side cottage sipping tea. Why? Because we’re in an alternate timeline (caused by a bump on the noggin’ during a worldwide blackout) where the Beatles don’t exist . . . but struggling musician Jack Malik, does. And he records a worldwide smash, debut album comprised of Lennon-McCartney compositions, well Jack Malik compositions. (Oh, and SNL’s hamfisted-and-not-funny Kate McKinnon from those annoying and not funny Tostitos and Verizon commercials is in the mix as the trite and troped “manager” of Jack’s career. You’ve been warned.)\n\nThe Beatles: Get Back (2021)\n\nYeah, we know we said “no documentaries.” But after breaking policy for Martin Scorsese and Ron Howard with their high-quality theatrical documents, how can we pass up Lord Peter Jackson restoring and reediting Michael Lindsay-Hogg’s Let It Be (1970) for a reissue under its original work title. And, as it turns out, in Jackson’s cut, the Beatles were getting along better than we were lead to believe.\n\nSeriously, which you would want: the Beatles getting the “Freddie Mercury” or “Elton John” treatment, or a Peter Jackson document on the Beatles?\n\nIf only George and John were here to experience it with Paul and Ringo.\n\nBecause our reviews to go “12,” Nigel.\n\nThe Beatles and India (2022)\n\nYes. We are breaking the “no documentary” rule, yet again. But since that promo MVD Blu-ray of the film came in the mail, we might as well.\n\nFilmed across India at all the sites of the Beatles’ visits — Mumbai, New Delhi, Rishikesh and Dehradun — accompanied with an array of unseen photographs, footage and interviews uncovered in India, The Beatles In India tells how George, John, Paul and Ringo took a break from their lives as the biggest band in the world to travel to a remote Himalayan ashram in search of spiritual enlightenment — and ended up unleashing an entirely new level of creativity from the band.\n\nI don’t know about you: but I’d like to see a narrative film about this phase of the Beatles’ career.\n\nThe Lost Weekend: A Love Story (2023)\n\nArgh! Another Beatles film?\n\nYes, it’s been 59 years since Beatlemania captured our hearts. And here we are. Dare we ponder what films will be unleashed on the 60th anniversary in 2024?\n\nAs with The Beatles and India, I would enjoy this seeing this documentary expanded upon — when thinking of, to name check a recent film, the transition of Marwencol (2010) to Welcome to Marwin (2018) — produced as a narrative film about this long-forgotten time of John Lennon’s life. When is Apple or Netflix going to produce a long-form streaming series on Lennon’s life? I’d subscribe to either service to see that series.\n\nSo, the love story goes that, at the request of Yoko Ono, May Pang, John Lennon’s then 19-year-old assistant at Apple Records, had a whirlwind, 18-month romance with John Lennon in the 1970s during a break in his marriage to Ono.\n\nYou can watch the official trailer on You Tube, with articles and reviews abound on the web. The film had its debut at the Tribeca Film Festival in 2022, and will hit theaters in April 2023. We’ll save you the aisle seat. But you buy the Clark Bars. And we love Clark bars as our go-to movie nosh: so hit that ATM.\n\nMidas Man (202?)\n\nIn July 2020, industry trades reported Grammy Award-winning, Swedish music video director Jonas Akerlund (Madonna’s “Ray of Light”; the films Lords of Chaos, the drug-epic debut, Spun, with Jason Schwartzman, the Dennis Quaid-starring thriller Horsemen) was hired as the director of this biographical drama on the Beatles’ manager Brian Epstein. Starting his management of the Beatles at the age of 25, Epstein also oversaw the careers of Gerry and the Pacemakers, Cilla Black, and Billy J. Kramer and the Dakotas — until his death at the age of 32.\n\nBy November 2021, it was reported filming, which began in October 2021 in London, shut down in mid-production — with Akerlund either fired or quitting the project. Filming, taking place in London, Liverpool, and New York, after a break, restarted in Los Angeles in January 2022. The film was taken over by director Sara Sugarman (Vinyl); she began her career as an actress in Alex Cox’s Sid and Nancy (1986) and a variety of British television series.\n\nEpstein’s life — and his personal relationship with John Lennon — was previously explored in The Hours and Times (1991).\n\nIn My Life (202?)\n\nIn December 2020, industry trades reported actors Wyatt Oleff (Guardians of the Galaxy and It franchises), Kevin Pollak (Outside Ozona), and SNL’s Janeane Garofalo (Lava) would star in this Beatles-inspired comedy-drama that draws from writer-director Mark Rosman’s (Evolver) personal experiences (his father was a Beverly Hills dermatologist) — with a dash narrative license that weaves true events with fiction.\n\nThe story follows Evan, a 16-year old John Lennon fan who discovers the Beatles move in next door to his Beverly Hills home prior to their 1965 date at the Hollywood Bowl. While Rosman never met John Lennon, young Evan does — and helps Lennon fulfill his dream of meeting Elvis Presley.\n\nReported to start production in Vancouver and Los Angeles in May 2021, the COVID pandemic derailed its production. As of this writing — which was written to commemorate the release of Peter Jackson’s The Beatles: Get Back — the film does not appear on Mark Rosman’s IMDb or Wikipedia pages.\n\nThank you for joining us in our three part series on the influence of the Beatles on cinema.\n\nHere’s the complete list of the films we reviewed in the series.\n\nClicking the “Part 1” and “Part 2” clicks will take you to the reviews, noted.\n\nPart 1\n\nYellow Submarine (1968)\n\nAll This and World War II (1976)\n\nAll You Need is Cash (1978)\n\nI Wanna Hold Your Hand (1978)\n\nSgt.

Let’s get to exploring!\n\nThe Reviews\n\nHead (1968)\n\nThe Kowboys (1970)\n\nToomorrow (1970)\n\nThe Rock ‘N’ Fun Magic Show (1975)\n\nSong of the Succubus (1975)\n\nRock-a-Die Baby (1975)\n\nThe Kids from C.A.P.E.R (1976)\n\nThe Savage Bees (1976)\n\nRoxy Page (1976)\n\nThe Night They Took Miss Beautiful (1977)\n\nA Year at the Top (1977)\n\nTerror Out of the Sky (1978)\n\nThe Triangle Factory Fire Scandal (1979)\n\nHead (1968)\n\nOkay, settle down. Settle. We are well aware Don Kirshner had no involvement in this box office boondoogle. There’s a method to the monkey business, here. Patience, ye fellow primates.\n\nBeginning its production with the title Changes (later the title of the Monkees ninth album — and final contractual album for Colgems — when they were reduced to the duo of Micky Dolenz and Davy Jones), what ultimately became Head made its debut in Los Angeles in the summer of 1968 under the title Movee Untitled. The already confusing and perpetual Andy Warhol-inspired non-sequitur that bombed in that L.A. test screening was cut down from a 110-minute length — to an even more baffling 86-minute cut (not that the lost 24-minutes said much, either) — that premiered in New York City on November 6, 1968.\n\nThe kid and tweens who loved the TV series hated the film. The mature hippies that the Monkees wanted to reach hated the film. So much for mixi"
