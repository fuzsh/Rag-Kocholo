        "text": "Review: NEWLY SINGLE Is A Hip, Edgy Relationship Dramedy\n\nA dark and somewhat bitter dramedy, director-writer-star Adam Christian Clark’s Newly Single is a punchy character piece that really draws you into its orbit. The central character (loosely based on and played by Clark himself), might alienate [...]\n\nTRUE DETECTIVE Season 3 Continues To Shape Up; Stephen Dorff Joins The Cast\n\nStephen Dorff (remember him?) has been cast opposite Mahershala Ali and Carmen Ejogo in season three of Nic Pizzolatto’s True Detective. The first season starring Matthew McConaughey and Woody Harrelson drew raves from critics, but season two [...]\n\nDVD Review: Diane Keaton And Morgan Freeman Live 5 Flights Up In RUTH AND ALEX\n\nSometimes all you need is a nice little movie to pass a couple of hours. Ruth And Alex (also known as 5 Flights Up) is the perfect way to spend an enjoyable evening in the company of Morgan Freeman and Diane Keaton. Richard Loncraine’s movie [...]\n\nWhat Scheduling Conflicts? Steve Carell Replaces Bruce Willis In Woody Allen’s Latest Movie\n\nBruce Willis shot for a day on Woody Allen’s latest, as yet untitled film (see above). Willis then dropped out due to ‘scheduling conflicts’ with his Broadway turn in the stage adaptation of Stephen King’s Misery. Read into that what you [...]\n\nBlu-ray Review: Noah Baumbach’s WHILE WE’RE YOUNG With Ben Stiller Is Astute And Entertaining\n\nNoah Baumbach’s While We’re Young takes a wonderfully incisive look at how people exist in the 21st Century. Baumbach casts a keen eye on how we interact in a digital age, where everything is disposable and easily cast aside. That’s not just [...]\n\nNew Trailer For Woody Allen’s IRRATIONAL MAN – You’re Either Onboard Or You’re Not\n\nWoody Allen’s 50th feature film(!!), Irrational Man hits UK screens on 11 September. Joaquin Phoenix, Emma Stone, Parker Posey and Jamie Blackley star in the comedy which sounds like it’s pure Woody Allen. You’re either onboard with this or [...]\n\nKevin Costner To Star In 10-Part Series Legal Series TRIAL For Amazon Prime Instant Video\n\nAmazon Instant Prime is officially ‘killing it’ with the talent they’re getting onboard. Not only did has the online platform managed to get Woody Allen and Terry Gilliam – but now Kevin Costner is in the frame to star in a new 10-part [...]\n\nDo The Time Warp: Ten Time Travel Movies\n\nThe latest film in a long line of time travel classics, Project Almanac follows a brilliant high school student and his friends who discover blueprints for a machine that can send them back in time. This latest foray into the popular [...]\n\nUK Poster For Peter Bogdanovich’s SHE’S FUNNY THAT WAY Starring Owen Wilson And Imogen Poots\n\nHere’s the new UK poster for Peter Bogdanovich’s latest screwball throwback She’s Funny That Way – Imogen Poots, Owen Wilson and Jennifer Aniston lead the cast. I’m genuinely thrilled that guys like Peter Bogdanovich and Woody Allen [...]\n\nReview: Jason Schwartzman And Jonathan Pryce In The Quirky And Literary LISTEN UP PHILIP\n\nAn odd mash-up of a movie, Listen Up Philip is a comedy from Alex Ross Perry that plays like Woody Allen meets Wes Anderson. If that concept floats your boat, then you’ll take great enjoyment from Listen Up Philip. If it doesn’t, then you might [...]\n\nThe Bruce Willis Comeback Continues As He Scores The Lead In A New Detective Comedy\n\nBruce Willis is a great comedy actor and it’s a real shame that he doesn’t star in a lot of comedies. It’s a even bigger shame that when he does, he just plays Bruce Willis – and role that he’s become very good at playing in recent [...]\n\nWoody Allen Unhappy With Amazon Deal, The Avengers And Other Assorted Woody Wonders\n\nWoody Allen is a man who likes routine. The native New Yorker makes a film every year at his own pace (his latest Irrational Man opens soon) and he seems happy and content to do this for as long as he can. What he doesn’t appear to be happy with [...]\n\nBruce Willis, Jesse Eisenberg and Kristen Stewart Join Woody Allen’s Latest Untitled Movie\n\nIt was just last week (following news that he was taking to the Broadway stage to star in Misery) that I pondered if Bruce Willis was going to reinvent himself in a new phase of his career following a string of substandard action-thrillers. It looks [...]\n\nDVD Review: SCOOP – A Minor Woody Is Better Than No Woody At All\n\nScoop isn’t one of Woody Allen’s finest movies but it’s an entertaining diversion that moves along at a decent pace. The 2006 mystery is one of Allen’s ‘London movies’ and it stars his latter day muse Scarlett Johansson alongside Allen [...]\n\nWoody Allen To Write And Direct A New Half Hour Series For Amazon Prime Instant Video\n\nWoody Allen will write and direct a new half hour series for Amazon. The show, currently titled The Untitled Woody Allen Project will air on Prime Instant Video next year. The plot is currently being kept under wraps and no cast has been announced [...]\n\nNew Poster For Kevin Smith’s TUSK; Why The Hate?\n\nKevin Smith’s latest film is Tusk, a horror-esqe tale of a man who moves into a new apartment and dresses up as a walrus for his roommate. That’s a pretty superficial description and I’m sure there is much more to it than that. The film has an [...]\n\nDVD Review: THE WOODY ALLEN COLLECTION Features Eight Movies And One Woody\n\nFew writers or directors have a work ethic like Woody Allen. The writer/director/actor consistently delivers a new film every year, something which is an impressive feat for anyone – but even more so now that he’s 78 years old. It’s the [...]\n\nOscars 2014: The Winners List\n\nThere were no major surprises at the 2014 Academy Awards – everything went as predicted, with the lion’s share of awards going to 12 Years A Slave, The Dallas Buyers Club (Matthew McConaughey is on one heck of a roll) and Gravity. The Wolf Of [...]\n\nDVD Review: FRANCES HA Is A Cappuccino And Biscotti Movie\n\nReal-life couple Noah Baumbach and Greta Gerwig reteam for Frances Ha, a black and white New York-set comedy-drama that infuses Annie Hall/Manhattan-era Woody Allen with 21st Century malaise. It’s a quirky little movie that follows the titular [...]"
