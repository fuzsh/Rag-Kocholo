        "text": "Gennaro Anthony Sirico Jr. ( July 29, 1942 – July 8, 2022) was an American actor best known for his role as Peter Paul \"Paulie Walnuts\" Gualtieri in The Sopranos. He also made numerous appearances in the films of Woody Allen.\n\nEarly life\n\nSirico was born in New York City on July 29, 1942, to a family of Italian descent. He grew up in Brooklyn, in the East Flatbush and Bensonhurst neighborhoods. Sirico's brother, Robert Sirico, is a Catholic priest and co-founder of the free-market Acton Institute.\n\nCareer\n\nSirico's first confirmed role in film was as an extra in the 1974 film Crazy Joe, securing the role with the help of Richard Castellano. Michael Gazzo was Sirico's first acting coach. Sirico played gangsters in a number of films, including Goodfellas, Mob Queen, Mighty Aphrodite, Love and Money, Fingers, The One Man Jury, Defiance, The Last Fight, Innocent Blood, Bullets over Broadway, The Pick-up Artist, Gotti, The Search for One-eye Jimmy, Cop Land, Turn of Faith, Hello Again, Mickey Blue Eyes, and Wonder Wheel.\n\nHe also played policemen in the films Dead Presidents and Deconstructing Harry. Sirico's most acclaimed acting job was that of Paulie Gualtieri in David Chase's Emmy award winning drama, The Sopranos. He originally auditioned for the role of Uncle Junior with Frank Vincent, but Dominic Chianese landed the role. David Chase instead offered him the role of Paulie Gualtieri; Sirico agreed under the condition that his character \"would not become a rat\".\n\nIn late 2013, he voiced the character of Vinny Griffin, who for three episodes was the family's pet dog on Family Guy, replacing Brian Griffin after his death; Brian would later be brought back via time travel. Sirico also made a live-action cameo in the episode \"Stewie, Chris, & Brian's Excellent Adventure\", where he threatens Stewie, who had insulted Italians, calling them \"ridiculous people\". Vinny would return in a cameo appearance at the end of the Season 15 premiere, \"The Boys in the Band\".\n\nIn 2018, he reunited with former Sopranos actors Federico Castelluccio and Vincent Pastore in Sarah Q.\n\nPersonal life\n\nSirico had two children, Joanne and Richard.\n\nIn 1999, Sirico and Sopranos co-star Vincent Pastore met with James Clemenza and his brother Jerry, Colombo crime family soldiers, at a Christmas party in Little Italy, Manhattan. Clemenza was under FBI surveillance at the time.\n\nIn 2008, Sirico released a cologne called Paolo Per Uomo.\n\nSirico died at an assisted living facility in Fort Lauderdale, Florida, on July 8, 2022, aged 79. No cause was given, but he had been diagnosed with dementia some years before his death.\n\nFilmography\n\nFilm\n\nYear Title Role Note 1974 Crazy Joe 1978 Hughes and Harlow: Angels in Hell Frankie Rio Fingers Riccamonza The One Man Jury Charlie Nuts 1980 Defiance Davey 1981 So Fine Associate 1982 Love and Money Raoul 1983 Exposed Thief The Last Fight Frankie 1987 The Galucci Brothers Galucci Brother The Pick-up Artist Patsy Cabaluso Hello Again Tough Guy 1989 White Hot Luke Cookie Carmine's Wiseguy The Big Bang Himself Documentary 1990 Catchfire Greek Guy Goodfellas Tony Stacks 1991 29th Street Fortunado 1992 Innocent Blood Jacko 1993 New York Cop Mr. C Romeo Is Bleeding Malacci 1994 Men Lie Bullets Over Broadway Rocco The Search for One-eye Jimmy Snake 1995 Dead Presidents Officer Spinelli Mighty Aphrodite Boxing Trainer Casino Extra (Nicky's crew: signal happy gambler) Dearly Beloved Mr. Bedutz Short film 1996 Everyone Says I Love You Escaped Convict 1997 Deconstructing Harry Police Officer Cop Land Toy Torillo The Deli Tony The Good Life Junior Never released 1998 Mob Queen Joey (The Heart) Aorta Celebrity Lou DeMarco 1999 Mickey Blue Eyes Risolli Guard 2000 It Had to Be You Ricky Valentino 2001 Smokin' Stogies Tony Batts 2002 Turn of Faith Jimmy 2008 The Sno Cone Stand Inc Bob Beasley 2009 Karma Calling G 2010 Skate Skate Short film 2014 Zarra's Law Tony Zarra Friends and Romans Bobby Musso Family on Board Rocco Short film 2015 Touched Anthony 2016 Café Society Vito 2017 Wonder Wheel Angelo 2018 Sarah Q Mr Danny TBA Respect the Jux Bobby Post-production Super Athlete Coach Lou Completed\n\nTelevision\n\nYear Title Role Notes 1977 Kojak Greek God Episode: \"Case Without a File\" 1982 Police Squad!
