        "text": "Paulie was a gangster of the old-school but had hidden depths, bridging the gap between traditional Mafia depictions and the modern Mob portrayed by creator David Chase. Multi-faceted Paulie might have slept with prostitutes but he was germaphobic and watched TV from an armchair wrapped in plastic. When boss Tony (James Gandolfini) confessed to his crew that he’d been seeing a psychiatrist, Paulie admitted that he’d briefly done likewise, shrugging: “I had some issues.” You don’t say.\n\nPerhaps Paulie’s most memorable moment was series three episode Pine Barrens, a firm favourite of fans. Effectively a two-hander with co-star Michael Imperioli, who played Christopher, it saw the pair stranded in a frozen forest after botching an assassination. Paulie lost a loafer in the snow. With nothing else to eat, the hapless pair ended up greedily sucking on sachets of ketchup found in an abandoned van's glovebox. Their bickering double act was like a Samuel Beckett play with added guns and swearing. Imperioli led tributes to Sirico today, saying the two actors “found a groove as Christopher and Paulie… I’m proud to say I did a lot of my best and most fun work with my dear pal Tony.”\n\nSirico’s own story would make a compelling drama itself. Born in New York to an Italian family, he had links to the Colombo crime family. He first got into trouble when he stole nickels from a local newsstand aged seven. His misdemeanours eventually escalated into armed robbery, extortion and weapons possession. “Where I grew up, every guy was trying to prove himself,” he told an interviewer. “You either had to have a tattoo or a bullethole. I had both.” He was once shot in the leg by a rival criminal in a row over a woman but as Sirico later said: “At the time, all I thought was, ‘F---ing ruined my white suit.’”\n\nHe was arrested 28 times and spent two stretches in prison but turned his life around when he discovered acting. While he was serving time in Sing Sing maximum security jail, an acting troupe formed of ex-convicts performed for inmates. “I watched ‘em and thought to myself, ‘I could do that,’” he recalled. The two chapters of his life occasionally crossed over. He once absent-mindedly took a gun to an acting class, explaining “I forgot I had it”.\n\nPerhaps understandably, he tended to be typecast and played gangsters in dozens of mob movies. He popped up in six Woody Allen films playing criminals and convicts. He was an uncredited extra in Francis Ford Coppola’s The Godfather: Part II and played flashy Tony Stacks in Martin Scorsese's Goodfellas. (Neatly, he played a wiseguy called Tony who reported to a boss named Paulie. In The Sopranos, it was the other way around.)\n\nSirico was aged 55 and sleeping on a fold-out bed at his “ma's house” when he was cast as Paulie. He originally auditioned for the role of Uncle Junior but writer Chase offered him Paulie. Sirico agreed on the sole condition that his character “would never become a rat”. Sirico acknowledged that he’d borrowed elements of Paulie from real-life gangsters he knew, including the way he held his hands together in front of himself – a physical indication that Paulie always had his guard up. He also took inspiration from movies, saying: “I learned how to walk and talk watching James Cagney.”\n\nIn later years, Sirico riffed playfully on his Sopranos persona by lending his distinctive voice to a Sesame Street puppet and a streetwise dog in Family Guy. He was also reunited with Sopranos castmate Van Zandt in Scandi-American mob spoof Lilyhammer. However, it’s the role of Paulie Walnuts for which he’ll forever be remembered.\n\nSirico died the day after his longtime friend James Caan, who ran in some of the same criminal circles. Caan fondly said of Sirico: “He's been able to romanticise his past, throw in a few bangles and sparkles, and use it as an actor. What you see is really him. He just adds a little pepper, a little cayenne, to spice it up.” Buonanotte to them both."
