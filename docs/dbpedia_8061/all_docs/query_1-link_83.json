        "text": "Dir: Woody Allen. Cast: Kate Winslet, Justin Timberlake, Juno Temple, James Belushi, David Krumholtz, Tony Sirico. 12A cert, 101 mins\n\nKate Winslet as a miserable American housewife in the 1950s? We’ve been here before, down Revolutionary Road and back, a decade ago. The differences in Wonder Wheel are quite pronounced. Her wardrobe isn’t post-war chic but dress-up-box Coney Island waitress; her hair is billowing auburn; and her director is Woody Allen, which presents a litany of problems right out of the gate.\n\nCan we ignore these? No, because the film sets about passive-aggressively reminding us of them. It isn’t Allen escaping into the past so much as defensively dredging it up, script-wise. And though he’s hired another world-class cinematographer, Vittorio Storaro, to give this the gaudy hypercoloured glow of a pastichey Douglas Sirk melodrama, the film’s look is pushy and unattractive, as if it’s wearing too much lipstick.\n\nI wish I could say that Winslet’s Ginny deserved better, but Allen has decided that she’s her own worst enemy. She’s saddled with a manic job at a clam house, and a second husband called, unbelievably, Humpy (James Belushi), a carousel operator in tatty string vests, who’s an ex-alcoholic, a ranting boor, and a general pain to be around.\n\nThen she meets a young lifeguard called Mickey (Justin Timberlake), who appeals to her sense of erudition and the theatrical, as well as being considerably more beddable than Belushi. Mickey reads literary criticism from his beach turret, talks endlessly of the “tragic human condition”, and addresses us right down the lens – the movie’s narrator, as well as Ginny’s certain downfall.\n\nHe is in every way a ridiculous figure, whose dreams of becoming a notable writer are even less possible to take seriously than the script intends. A predictably fickle lover – drawn not only to Ginny, but her up-for-it stepdaughter (Juno Temple), who’s oblivious to their liaison – he behaves more or less absolutely how you’d expect a silly amateur intellectual played by Justin Timberlake to behave.\n\nGinny wouldn’t be the first heroine to be seduced and ruined when something’s heating up with a slippery suitor, but Winslet seems to be fighting a war against Allen’s direction, and everything goes to pot. The film gets bored of rendering Ginny sympathetically, and thrusts her desperation right in our faces: by the end, picking her best dress out for no earthly reason and swamping herself in paste jewellery like some boardwalk Blanche DuBois, she’s semi-grotesque.\n\nNote that Allen’s men, from Manhattan to Magic in the Moonlight, score with much younger women and routinely get to walk off with them as trophies. But when women tango with guys even slightly their junior, as Mia Farrow did playing another kind of stifled middle-aged housewife in 1990’s Alice, it rarely pans out well. An archaic imbalance is hardly being reflected. Try reinforced.\n\nAnd hang on – Mickey faces a choice between the neurotic, married mother or her blameless live-in daughter. Where does Woody get his inspiration? There’s one line in Mickey’s voiceover (“The heart has its own hieroglyphics”) that’s inches away from Allen’s infamous self-justification about the Soon-Yi affair – “The heart wants what it wants”. It rings out like self-conscious thunder in this bottom-drawer scenario.\n\nIt’s hardly the worst of the writing, either. Ginny’s first husband was a jazz drummer “whose rhythm pulsated with life”. Her pet riposte is “Spare me the bad drama!”, as if noticing she’s in one makes it automatically more interesting.\n\nPerhaps American lives can feel like bad drama, but never this ostentatiously, with Storaro’s garish close-ups turning everyone into a waxwork except Temple, who gets by rather well, and four characters laboriously pimping out each other’s backstories until you’re begging for a time out. Say, a ride on Coney's Ferris wheel, which might go around in circles, but at least has the virtue of getting us off the ground."
