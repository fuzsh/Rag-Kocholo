Alternating between moments of stark realism and hyper-stylization, the film eschews traditional storytelling in favor of a somewhat evasive narrative. Speaking of stark realism, a number of people who appeared in the film weren't actors, but random men that Johansson tried to pick up off the side of the road.\n\n#76. Minority Report (2002)\n\n- Director: Steven Spielberg\n\n- Metascore: 80\n\n- Critic reviews: 37\n\n- Runtime: 2 hours and 25 minutes\n\nThis futuristic thriller, based on a short story by sci-fi author Philip K.
