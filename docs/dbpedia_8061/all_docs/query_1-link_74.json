His assignments take him to the swankiest corners of Manhattan, but as he jumps from one lavish party to another and engages in numerous empty romances, he starts to doubt the worth of his work. Meanwhile, top TV producer Tony falls for Robin and introduces her to the world of celebrity.",

        "text": "This movie has got a fucking Jack Nicholson impression in it oh my god and a 24-year old Leonardo DiCaprio playing the cocky young actor who is a complete asshole and has lines like 'Get your fucking hand off my neck!' or 'Don't fucking walk away from me, bitch!' and who then later on in the day has a foursome with Kenneth Branagh and two chicks just after snorting a healthy dose of cocaine and getting properly stoned for the occasion. I mean, goddamn. Seriously, what's not to love about this highly improper and at times offensive but wackily funny piece of work that was shot in black and white because Woody Allen is just the kinda guy who is…\n\nlook, yes, i knew that sitting through this woody allen picture for leonardo dicaprio would be a bad idea. i knew i'd have to tolerate emotionally-stunted neurotic intellectual men who use the word \"exquisite\" to describe women (and who are casually predatory), as well as half-assed caricatures of women. i got 50 minutes into this movie without a single appearance by leonardo dicaprio and was thinking, \"did woody allen really use leonardo dicaprio as a marketing ploy to trick people into seeing his shitty commentary on fame?\" and i'm convinced that the answer is yes because he's in this for literally 10 minutes. so maybe that's part of allen's weak critique: \"haha you suckers sat through my bad movie for…\n\nPerformances: 7.2/10\n\nStory: 7/10\n\nProduction: 7.7/10\n\nOverall : 7.3/10\n\nWhile attempting to tackle the entirety of Woody Allen's work, I've reached the conclusion that almost every single film is above average. It's rare that he puts out a stinker (What's Up, Tiger Lilly or A Midsummer Night's Sex Comedy come to mind). It's also not often that I come out calling one of his films a masterpiece (Zelig and Radio Days are the only two that received such praise from me). Most of his films fall in that 7/10 range. They're just so easily digestible and so simple to relate to that I devour them without blinking an eye.\n\nCelebrity is no different. It features some great sweeping camera work.…"
