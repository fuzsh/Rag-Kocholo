        "text": "Tony Sirico, known for playing the colorful Paulie Walnuts on the Sopranos, has died at the age of 79. The actor is reported to have died in an assisted living facility in Fort Lauderdale, Florida. Although no official cause has been revealed for the death, he was known to be suffering from dementia over the past couple of years.\n\nTony Sirico's character brought some much-needed levity and eccentricity to a show like Sopranos which followed the gritty life of ruthless New Jersey mobsters.\n\nKnown for predominantly playing mobster characters, he was unbothered by being typecast, his only condition being that his character should not become a rat (an informant). He was also known for his appearance in Family Guy, American Dad, Woody Allen movies, and another mob classic Goodfellas.\n\nTalking about Tony Sirico on Instagram, Micheal Imperioli called him a \"partner in crime,\" and goes on to say that \"he was as tough, as loyal and as big-hearted as anyone Iâ€™ve ever known\""
