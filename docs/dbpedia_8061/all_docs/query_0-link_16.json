        "text": "Brooklyn has gone to the stars once again.\n\nAward-winning actor/director Woody Allen was spotted directing scenes for a new, mysterious movie set in 1950s Coney Island on Thursday, September 29.\n\nWhile details about the film have not been publicly released – in true Allen fashion – reports claim that it will feature an array of stars including the likes of Justin Timberlake, Kate Winslet, James Belushi, Juno Temple and Tony Sirico.\n\nMovie database IMDb, has the film listed as “Untitled Woody Allen Project” with an expected release date of 2017. The site’s story line description only reveals that it is “a period drama set in New York in the 1950s.”\n\nThe portion of the Coney boardwalk used for filming was transformed for the film, as photos depict a 1950’s-era version of mainstay Ruby’s Bar & Grill – changed to “Ruby’s Clam House” for the film – and another storefront transformed into a vintage arcade."
