        "text": "The Boys in the Band\n\nStewie and Brian form a childrenâs band that quickly rises to fame until they let a girl get between them and drive the band apart. Meanwhile, Peter and Lois insist that Chris gets a job so he takes a job managing Quagmireâs sex life as his personal assistant.\n\nStewie, Chris & Brian's Excellent Adventure\n\nTo help Chris ace his ninth grade history class, Stewie and Brian employ the time travel machine for educational purposes. Not surprisingly, all three get stuck in the past.\n\nBring Your Daughter to Work\n\nWhen they have the same dream about a missing homeless man who is the subject of Allison's most recent case, Bridgette and Allison swap personalities, causing mayhem at home, at school and with the investigation.\n\nGrinder vs. Grinder\n\nTimothy Olyphant is back in Boise and the rivalry between Dean and him continues when Stewart invites Olyphant to spend more time around Sanderson & Yao. After getting into an argument about who is closer to being a real lawyer, the two âGrindersâ decide to go head-to-head in a mock trial."
