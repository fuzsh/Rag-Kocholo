        "text": "He's One,Too\n\nDoes DAN KLORES -- a publicist for such entertainment types as JEAN DOUMANIAN (a former executive producer of ''Saturday Night Live'' and WOODY ALLEN movies) and BRAD GREY (an executive producer of ''The Sopranos'') -- see himself as one of them? He, too, makes movies, it turns out. Only one so far, but it has been accepted for the Sundance Film Festival.\n\nThe film, a documentary, follows his childhood friends from Brighton Beach, Brooklyn. He shares the directing credit with one of them, RON BERGER, now chief executive at Euro RSCG MVBMS Partners, an advertising agency.\n\n''I hired a camera crew and shot 80 hours of interviews with 24, 25 guys,'' Mr. Klores said. ''I've lost 13 friends because only 11 made the movie. And 5 of them are irked because only 6 are major characters.''\n\nAnd then there was the title. ''Originally, we were going to call it 'Under the Boardwalk: The Boys of 2nd Street Park' or 'Hole in the Fence: The Boys of 2nd Street Park,' '' he said. ''One character explained the hole in the fence was about shortcuts, that often we were taught, take the shortcut.'' He and Mr. Berger took a shortcut and called the film ''The Boys of 2nd Street Park.''\n\nA Little Toughness Helps\n\nNot enough bids on a Christmas tree? Time for the actor TONY SIRICO to rally the bidders at an auction aboard the Intrepid Sea Air Space Museum on Wednesday. What he said was unprintable here and sounded like an outburst from Paulie Walnuts, the short-tempered character he plays on ''The Sopranos.'' ''I'm not really good at this,'' said Mr. Sirico, above, strutting around in a dark blue pinstripe suit and his tanning-parlor tan. But he managed to sell the tree for $3,000. The money went to Heartshare, which helps children in need of foster care and adoption.\n\nIs Mr. Sirico preparing for life after ''The Sopranos''?\n\n''I've already been talking with people about creating television sitcoms,'' he said. How about Broadway? JAMIE-LYNN SIGLER, LORRAINE BRACCO, EDIE FALCO and JOE PANTOLIANO have all found their way on the great white way.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
