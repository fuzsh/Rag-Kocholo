        "text": "Sopranos star Tony Sirico passed away at the age of 79. Best known for his role as Peter Paul “Paulie Walnuts” Gualtieri in The Sopranos, he had also made numerous appearances in the films of Woody Allen.\n\nHis Sopranos co-star Michael Imperioli posted on Instagram, “It pains me to say that my dear friend, colleague, and partner in crime, the great TONY SIRICO, has passed away today. Tony was like no one else: he was as tough, as loyal, and as big-hearted as anyone I’ve ever known. I was at his side through so much: through good times and bad. But mostly good. And we had a lot of laughs. We found a groove as Christopher and Paulie, and I am proud to say I did a lot of my best and most fun work with my dear pal Tony.”\n\nHe added, “I will miss him forever. He is truly irreplaceable. I send love to his family, friends, and his many, many fans. He was beloved and will never be forgotten. Heartbroken today. #thesopranos #hbo #tonysirico #pauliewalnuts.”\n\nNotable Celebrity Deaths of 2022\n\nNancy Brooks has been working in the country music industry for almost 30 years.
