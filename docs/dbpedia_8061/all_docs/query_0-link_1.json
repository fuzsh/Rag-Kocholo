        "text": "EXCLUSIVE: The Sopranos alum Tony Sirico is joining the cast of Woody Allen‘s untitled film set to shoot this fall in New York. His role is unknown but he joins a cast that includes Juno Temple, Kate Winslet, James Belushi, and Justin Timberlake. Plot details are under wraps, but the film written and to be directed by Allen is a period drama set in the late ’50s. Allen is producing alongside his frequent collaborators Letty Aronson and Edward Walson.\n\nThis marks Sirico’s sixth time in a Woody Allen picture, having previously appeared this summer in Café Society which debuted in theaters July 15, along with roles in Allen’s earlier Celebrity, Deconstructing Harry, Everyone Says I Love You, Mighty Aphrodite, and Bullets Over Broadway. Sirico’s next film is Respect the Jux, written and directed by Christ GarYah. He’s repped by Bob McGowan at McGowan Management.\n\nAllen’s next project, the scripted series Crisis in Six Scenes, debuts on Amazon September 30."
