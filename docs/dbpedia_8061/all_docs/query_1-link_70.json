        "text": "Lorin Williams July 8th, 2022 - 8:38 PM\n\nAnother beloved wise guy has passed in The Sopranos actor Tony Sirico, according to Deadline. The New York native starred as the loyal mob henchmen in HBO’s Emmy-winning breakout series, in which he coveted two SAG Awards for Best Drama Ensemble. As the series received 21 Emmys in its six-season run, Sirico was never nominated for Supporting Actor. His family announced he passed in an assisted living center in Florida. He would have turned 80 years old later this month.\n\nAs news of his death broke, tributes from former co-stars and colleagues surfaced. Sopranos actor Michael Imperioli called Sirico ” truly irreplaceable” in a statement via Deadline. Imperioli starred as Christopher Moltisanti in the HBO drama series appearing with Sircio in the standout episode, “Pine Barrens.”\n\n“It pains me to say that my dear friend, colleague and partner in crime, the great Tony Sirico has passed away today. Tony was like no one else: he was as tough, as loyal and as big hearted as anyone I’ve ever known. I was at his side through so much: through good times and bad. But mostly good. And we had a lot of laughs. We found a groove as Christopher and Paulie and I am proud to say I did a lot of my best and most fun work with my dear pal Tony. I will miss him forever. He is truly irreplaceable. I send love to his family, friends and his many many fans. He was beloved and will never be forgotten. Heartbroken today.”\n\nSirico also received touching words from Lorraine Bracco, who co-starred with him in Goodfellas. “A stand up guy who always had my back and who loved my children and my parents,” Bracco said via Deadline. “I have a lifetime of memories with Tony – starting with Goodfellas to The Sopranos and way beyond but my God, did we have fun doing the Bensonhurst Spelling Bee. I hope he’s in heaven cracking everybody up now. Love you, my pal.” Bracco played Tony Soprano’s (James Gandolfini) therapist in The Sopranos and appeared with Sirico in the Funny or Die sketch “The Bensonhurst Spelling Bee.”\n\nBorn July 29, 1942, Gennaro Anthony ‘Tony’ Sirico’s reputation as a street guy came from experience. According to Deadline, he was arrested 28 times prior to his acting career and served a 20-month stint in New York’s Sing Sing. Terence Winter (Vinyl), Sopranos executive producer, relayed in a past Deadline interview how Sirico “was this scary mob guy… he was the real deal.”\n\nSirico began his acting career as an extra in the 1974 film, Crazy Joe, according to Deadline. He soon began appearing in different TV series throughout the 1970s and 80s such as Kojak, Police Squad!, and Miami Vice. Years before his iconic series role, he starred in films such as Woody Allen’s Celebrity, Bullets Over Broadway, and Mighty Aphrodite. He also appeared in Martin Scorsese’s (The Gangs of New York, The Irishman) Goodfellas as Tony Stacks alongside the late Ray Liotta (Black Bird).\n\nThen, in 1999, David Chase’s (The Many Saints of Newark) The Sopranos hit HBO becoming an instant success and an ultimate gamechanger for the network and the TV landscape. Deadline reports Sirico originally auditioned three times for the role of Junior. Finally, Chase called and told Sirico about the role of Paulie Walnuts.\n\n“I am still Paulie,” Sirico said in a Deadline interview celebrating the show’s 20th anniversary. “I can’t go home no more. I am Paulie, till I pass.”\n\nIn addition to his mob roles from Mob Queen to Defiance, Tony exercised in voice acting and commercials. Deadline reports his success amidst The Sopranos landed him voice acting roles in Seth McFarlence’s Family Guy and American Dad!. He also starred in a line of Denny’s commercials and an early commercial for then-DVD mailing service, Netflix.\n\nJamie-Lynn Sigler (How I Met Your Mother) who played Tony’s daughter, Meadow Soprano, stated, “Tony was the real deal in every sense of the word,” according to Deadline. “He lived many lives, but with full passion in all of them. I met him when I was 16, and he made it clear from day one that he was my forever protector, and he was. I will remember him as a tremendous talent and energy that you could never look away from. I’m so lucky to have known him. My thoughts and prayers to all that were lucky enough to be loved by him.”\n\nSirico is survived by two children, Joanne Sirico Bello and Richard Sirico, as well as a wealth of other family members. A burial will occur on Wednesday, July 13, and will be led by his brother, Fr. Robert Sirico. Being a war veteran and a supporter of the Wounded Veteran Project, the family is asking donations be made to Wounded Warriors, St. Jude’s Hospital, and the Action Institute in Sirico’s honor."
