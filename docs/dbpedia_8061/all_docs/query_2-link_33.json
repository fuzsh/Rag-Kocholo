        "text": "We know that Woody Allen already has his next film, You Will Meet a Tall Dark Stranger, lined up with Antonio Banderas, Josh Brolin, Anthony Hopkins and Naomi Watts. However, Allen has, as usual, been secretly busy gathering talent for his next as yet untitled film, as THR's Risky Biz reports Owen Wilson has been attached to a project of which there aren't any known details about story or characters. This of course has been Allen's trademark as he continues a 33-year streak of writing and directing one (or more) feature film every single year, starting with 1977's Best Picture winning Annie Hall. The man is a cinema machine.\n\nOf course, with no details other than rumblings that Allen had offered a part to former model and France's first lady, Carla Bruni, we have no word on whether or not Wilson will be leading the flick or if he will simply have a supporting role. Slowly but surely, Wilson has gotten back on his feet after a suicide attempt around two and a half years ago. Most recently he voiced a bit part in Wes Anderon's Fantastic Mr. Fox, and also puts his voice to work in the upcoming comic strip adaptation of Marmaduke, as well as starring in the Farrelly Brothers upcoming sex comedy Hall Pass with Jenna Fischer, Jason Sudeikis and Amanda Bynes.\n\nAllen is well known for a somewhat peculiar, and extensive audition process often times involving intimate conversations about the character, and very little of the script revealed to the actor, even once they've gotten the part and have started filming. Then, of course, there's Allen's dedication to his hometown team the New York Knicks which not even his passion for filmmaking takes a backseat to as he says, \"If I'm shooting a film and it's 6 o'clock at night and I've got a take, and I think I might be able to get a better take if I stayed, but the Knicks tipoff is at 7:30, then that's it.\" And yet year after year, Allen usually makes a quality film that he wrote and directed, while taking the time to enjoy some basketball. I'll say it again: The man is a machine."
