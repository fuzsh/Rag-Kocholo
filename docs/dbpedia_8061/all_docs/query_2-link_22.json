However, whilst on hiatus from the crime thriller series, Emerson will make a return to high profile films for the first time since The Legend of Zorro in 2005. Deadline has word that Emerson has snagged an unknown role in the next film from Woody Allen, which is currently untitled and, as with all of the New York filmmaker's projects, has the script and plot kept tightly under wraps.\n\nAs of now, the only details we have include the involvement of Cate Blanchett, Bradley Cooper, Alec Baldwin (who will be seen in Allen's To Rome with Love later this year), and the film will be shooting in San Francisco. Previously, Happy-Go-Lucky star Sally Hawkins was listed on the film's IMDB, but we're still not sure if that's true. However, Deadline has added Bobby Cannavale, who turned in a hilarious performance in Win Win, one of my favorite films from 2011, to the cast list, and that's some great news. Hopefully more details will emerge soon, so we know exactly what we're dealing with. Of course, all we really need to know is that it's a new film from Woody Allen for our interest to be piqued."
