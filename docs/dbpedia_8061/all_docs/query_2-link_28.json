        "text": "Three weeks after making acting history as the first American actress to win a César—France’s version of the Oscar—Kristen Stewart has signed on to star in Woody Allen’s next film, reports Deadline. According to the write-up, the Twilight alum will make her Woody Allen oeuvre debut opposite Bruce Willis, another Allen first-timer, and Stewart’s former Adventureland castmate Jesse Eisenberg in the untitled picture. (Eisenberg previously starred in Allen’s 2012 comedy To Rome with Love.) Per usual for the filmmaker, details about his new endeavor are scant.\n\nThis is just the latest career boon for Stewart, whose supporting performance alongside Juliette Binoche in Cloud of Sils Maria earned her rave reviews at Cannes last year in addition to the aforementioned hardware. (We Americans are still waiting on a release date for what is being hailed as Stewart’s critical breakout role.) Continuing her indie streak, the actress recently hopped aboard an untitled project from Kelly Reichardt co-starring Laura Dern and Michelle Williams. About the lives of people living in small-town Montana, the film will co-star Stewart as a lawyer/teacher who befriends a student in her class.\n\nStewart has a few other films on the horizon, including the action comedy American Ultra, which co-stars Walton Goggins and, again, Jesse Eisenberg, and Equals, a sci-fi love story opposite Nicholas Hoult.\n\nOnward and upward, K.
