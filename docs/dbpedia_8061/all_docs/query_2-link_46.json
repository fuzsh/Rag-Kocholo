        "text": "Though it's still deemed \"Untitled Woody Allen Project\" on IMDb it appears the 2013 film from the prolific auteur will be named Blue Jasmine, according to a press release from Sony Pictures Classics, the company which has acquired the rights to the film, posted over at Movie City News.\n\nThe film, which stars Cate Blanchett, Alec Baldwin, Louis C.K. and many many others, \"is the story of the final stages of an acute crisis and a life of a fashionable New York housewife.\" And that's basically familiar territory for Allen. Filming locations listed on IMDb include New York and San Francisco, so this looks like at least somewhat of a homecoming for Allen, who has recently taken to filming abroad. That said, he's still got his foreign influence. Oddly enough, The Woody Allen Pages first spotted the title's announcement via French Twitter accounts."
