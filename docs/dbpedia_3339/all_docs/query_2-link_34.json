        "text": "Double Blind Peer Review Policy\n\nJELPS employs a rigorous peer review system. All submitted manuscripts undergo a rigorous peer review process before publication. Particularly, JELPS utilizes a three-stage review process: (1) editorial office, (2) external/expert review and (3) editors’ decision.\n\nStage 1. Editorial Review\n\nIn the first place, a submitted manuscript is reviewed by the JELPS editorial office to ensure that it aligns with the aim and scope of the JELPS before it is sent to external reviewers. At this stage, the manuscript is reviewed for the following: (a) Scope, (b) Originality and Plagiarism Check, (c) English Language, (d) Recent Reference Check.\n\nState 2: Double Blind or Anonymous Peer Review\n\nOnce a manuscript successfully completes the editorial office review process, it proceeds to the second stage. A double-blind peer-review process is where both the reviewer and the author remain anonymous throughout the process. Therefore, the manuscript is reviewed by at least two external expert reviewers with scholarly affiliation. The author's identity is unknown to the reviewer. Reviewers are required to evaluate the manuscripts and provide constructive feedback to enable the author(s) improve the content of the manuscript.\n\nReviewers also score the manuscript in terms of originality, contribution to the educational leadership field, technical quality, clarity of presentation and depth of research. Finally, reviewers make one of the following suggestions about the manuscript;\n\nAccept with no revision\n\nAccept with minor revision\n\nAccept with moderate revision\n\nAccept with major revision\n\nReject: Not suitable for further processing.\n\nState 3: Editors’ Decision\n\nUpon receipt of the reviewers’ initial evaluations, the editorial office reviews the comments. If there are significant differences among two reviewers’ recommendations, the manuscript is re-sent to a third reviewer. The review process is usually completed between two to six weeks. Using the reviewers’ and editors’ feedback, author(s) make corrections to the manuscript and submits a revised manuscript. Upon receipt of the revised submission, the manuscript undergoes the third and final stage of the review process. Based on the revised manuscript and all the reviewers’ feedback, the editor makes the final decisions for a publication.\n\nManuscript Submissions to JELPS\n\nManuscripts will be sent to Dr. Yavuz, Editor-in Chief, Journal of Educational Leadership and Policy Studies for initial review at yavuzo1@southernct.edu.\n\nFrequency\n\nJELPS is published semiannually by Southern Connecticut State University\n\nAudience\n\nEducational leaders, educational policymakers, teachers, school leader educators, teacher educators, curriculum specialists, administrators, practitioners, and others interested in educational leadership and policy studies.\n\nQuality Assurance\n\nThe Southern Connecticut State University’s SafeAssign plagiarism software is used for the verification of original work.\n\nPublication Ethics\n\nJELPS is committed to upholding the integrity of the academic record. We encourage authors to refer to the Committee on Publication Ethics’ International Standards for Authors. Authors are reminded to check their proofs carefully to confirm that all author information, including names, affiliations, sequence and contact details are correct, if any, are accurate. Please note that if there are any changes to the author list at this stage all authors will be required to complete and sign a form authorizing the change.\n\nOpen Access Policy\n\nThe JELPS uses Open Access Policy that enables the dissemination of manuscripts to the global community without restriction through the internet. Thus, all articles published in the JELPS can be accessed by anyone with internet connection around the world. JELPS strongly supports the Open Access initiative. Abstracts and full texts of all articles published by the JELPS are freely accessible to everyone immediately after publication\n\nPublication Charges\n\nThere are no submission fees or page charges for this journal.\n\nCopyright Notice\n\nAuthors hold the copyright to any article they publish in JELPS. Before the article is published, each author must provide full consent for the publication agreement. Credit as original publisher should be given to JELPS if reprints are made and include the URL of the JELPS publication. Anyone can copy any article(s) found within JELPS as along as credit is given and copies of the article are not sold.\n\nERIC Selection Policy\n\nThe Education Resources Information Center (ERIC) is an online bibliographic and full-text digital library of education research, including journal articles and non-journal materials. ERIC is a program administered by the National Center for Education Evaluation and Regional Assistance of the Institute of Education Sciences (IES) at the U.S. Department of Education (the Department). ERIC’s mission is to select, index, and make quality education research widely available and searchable through a user-friendly website. Based on the ERIC Selection Policy, JELPS articles will be selected to be indexed in ERIC. Selection standards and criteria are determined by the official ERIC authorization.
