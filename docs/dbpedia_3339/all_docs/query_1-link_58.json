Post-war, Robert graduated from Marquette University School of Journalism with a BA in 1948. On May 13, 1950 at St. Elizabeth (Milwaukee, WI) he was united in marriage to Caroline Walczak. Robert spent his professional career working in various roles of technical writing, advertising, and community public relations. Robert was employed by: P&H, Natural Gas Company, and Young Radiator.
