        "text": "Dr. Michael Sullivan said his interest in pediatrics stems from a longtime interest in science, his enjoyment in interacting with people and his genuine desire to make a difference.\n\nHe takes a preventive approach to your child's health by providing well-child visits. He treats children and adolescents when they are sick and manages chronic or ongoing medical conditions.\n\nDr. Sullivan earned his medical degree in pediatrics at the University of Wisconsin School of Medicine & Public Health, Madison, where he now also serves as clinical assistant professor of clinical pediatrics. He completed his residency at the University of Florida-Shands Children’s Hospital, Gainesville. He is board-certified in pediatrics.​​\n\n“I like to work with children – they’re generally happy and fun to be with,” said Dr. Sullivan. “Part of my job is to be a calming influence, to reassure them and their parents that, even though they’re not feeling well, the situation may not be as bad as they think.” He added that it is rewarding to teach parents how to interact in positive ways with their children and maximize their advancement.\n\nThe Milwaukee-area native joined Marshfield Clinic in 2005. “Marshfield Clinic provides access to specialists and facilities that support my ability to deliver quality care,” he said."
