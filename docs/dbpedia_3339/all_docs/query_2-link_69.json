        "text": "Welcome Xavier alumni!\n\nWe are blessed to serve the Xavier Catholic Schools alumni community in several ways, from welcoming alumni back to Xavier with a variety of special events, assisting individual classes with their reunions, or providing alumni updates in the X, the Xavier Magazine, the monthly alumni newsletter, or on this website!\n\nAlumni truly define our alma mater and serve as its strongest legacy. Each alum is important to us as you hold a vital part of the #XavierXperience through your own personal journey as a student here.\n\nThis area of the web site is designed to keep our alumni informed of special events, activities, and programs. Stay connected with your friends, former classmates, teachers and all those who made your experience at Xavier memorable by creating an account on the exclusive Xavier Hawks Connect (AlumniFire) page. For more information, visit Xavier Hawks Connect.\n\nWe love seeing you at games, theatre productions, and visiting the school, as well as having our students learn from your personal and professional experiences. The Advancement Office provides opportunities for alumni throughout the year and even opportunities for you and your family to continue to create lasting memories with the Xavier Catholic Schools community!\n\nBe sure to stay in touch and take advantage of the many events available throughout the year.
