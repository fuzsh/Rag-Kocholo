        "text": "3rdDegree_90\n\nThe emblem of the Order dates from the second Supreme Council meeting on May 12, 1883, when James T. Mullen, who was then supreme knight, designed it. The emblem indicates a shield mounted upon the Formée cross (having the arms narrow at the center and expanding toward the ends). The shield is that associated with a medieval knight. The Formée cross is the representation of a traditional artistic design of the cross of Christ through which all graces of redemption were procured for mankind. This then represents the Catholic spirit of the Order.\n\nMounted on the shield are three objects: a fasces (a bundle of rods bound together about an ax with the blade projecting) standing vertically and, crossed behind it, an anchor and a dagger or short sword. The fasces from Roman days, carried before magistrates as an emblem of authority, is symbolic of authority which must exist in any tightly-bonded and efficiently operating organization. The anchor is the mariner's symbol for Columbus, patron of the Order, while the short sword or dagger was the weapon of the Knight when engaged upon an errand of mercy. Thus, the shield expresses Catholic Knighthood in organized merciful action, and with the letters, K of C, it proclaims this specific form of activity.\n\nPetit Jean Meats has been producing tasty meats since 1926 in Morrilton Arkansas. Their hams “get the taste” from the seasoning processes with a blend of special ingredients where they soak up the aroma from smoldering hickory chips for at least 16 hours. No water is added to the hams.\n\nThe Knights of Columbus’ relationship with Petit Jean started in 2006. The Ladies of the Sacred Heart took a tour of the Morrilton Packing Company in early 2006 when Johnny Kerie, Marketing Manager, informed them that it will provide hams for a fundraiser. The only stipulation was that the money raised would go to charity. Milt Spaniel contacted Johnny Kerie to coordinate the donated hams for the Knights’ first “Fall Fest” that benefitted St. Michael’s Catholic Child Care. This tradition has continued annually for 5 years.\n\nIn 2007 Johnny Kerie called Milt to suggest that the Knights could raise additional money for charity by selling the products at competitive prices and earn a small commission. The initial organizers of ham sales were Milt Spaniel, Ed Kearns and Bill Nosek who selected the products, prices, order form design, financial record requirements, publicity, sales teams, and candidates for gift cards. This is how the annual “K of C Ham Sales” were started here at Sacred Heart.\n\nThe council was instituted on January 1, 1990 with 56 charter members, nine of whom were exemplified shortly before the institution of the council. The other charter members transferred from other councils, including many from the Hot Springs Council.\n\nAPPLICATION FOR CHARTER*\n\nJanuary 1 , 1990\n\nTo the Committee on Charter,\n\nSupreme Council, Knights of Columbus:\n\nListed herewith are the names of charter members of a new council that has been instituted in the city of Hot Springs Village in the jurisdiction of Arkansas.\n\nThe date of institution of this new council was Jan. 1, 1990.\n\nPlease print or type names.\n\nRaymond H.

Called together by their 29-year-old parish priest, Father Michael J. McGivney, these men formed a fraternal society that would one day become the world’s largest Catholic family fraternal service organization.\n\nThey sought strength in solidarity, and security through unity of purpose and devotion to a holy cause: they vowed to be defenders of their country, their families and their faith.\n\nThese men were bound together by the ideal of Christopher Columbus, the discoverer of the Americas, the one whose hand brought Christianity to the New World. Their efforts came to fruition with the incorporation of the Knights of Columbus on March 29, 1882.\n\nThey were Knights of Columbus.\n\n(August 18. 2006)\n\nSt. Michael’s was established in Hot Springs, Arkansas in 1908 by the Sisters of Our Lady of Charity at the invitation of Bishop Morris of the Little Rock Diocese. Its initial mission was providing for girls in need. The mission changed over time so that in the latter part of the 20th century, St. Michael’s was a Catholic elementary school. It was also housing girls who were wards of the state and Asian refugees through the Diocese of Little Rock. The religious community had dwindled in numbers over the passing of time, and financial conditions were such that cash outflows for both the convent and the school were far exceeding cash inflows. The school was closed in 2001.\n\nThe sisters’ faith in the Lord remained strong, but their business acumen was limited. In July 2000, a knight from the Knights of Columbus Council 10208 in Hot Springs Village, AR, Milt Spaniel and his wife, Janice, became involved with St. Michael’s. From their love of the sisters and St. Michael’s, a relationship evolved that still flourishes today. The couple enlisted the support of Council 10208 and the people of Sacred Heart of Jesus Church in Hot Springs Village and formed a group of concerned people called \"Friends of St. Michael’s,\" and they set out to help St. Michael’s get back on solid footing. Through their efforts, St. Michael’s is now looking forward to celebrating its 100th anniversary in 2008.\n\nIn June, 1973, fifteen faithful Catholics attended the first Mass in Hot Springs Village at the fire station on Calella Road. The celebrant was Father Bernard Malone, the current pastor. This led to Thursday evening services at the Village Methodist Church, conducted by Fr. Reynolds, the Pastor of St. Mary's Church in Hot Springs. In 1978 the growing number of Catholics formed an association called the Village Catholics.\n\nIn 1979 these Catholics petitioned Bishop Andrew J. MacDonald for permission to build a Catholic church in the Village. This permission was granted and, after raising sufficient funds, the parishioners broke ground for the church in July 1981. It was dedicated by Bishop McDonald on May 11, 1982.\n\nOne Life, One Rose\n\nThe Our Lady of Guadalupe Silver Rose Program began in 1960 as a project of the Columbian Squires of North America to honor the Blessed Virgin under her title of “Our Lady of Guadalupe, Patroness of the Americas.” The program has continued since then as a project of Squires Circles, councils and Fourth Degree assemblies in several jurisdictions.\n\nIn 2001 Supreme Knight Carl A. Anderson expanded the program by beginning the \"Running of the Rose\" from the 119 Annual Meeting of the Supreme Council in Toronto. \"The 'Running of the Rose' is a perfect program for the Knights of Columbus,\" said Supreme Knight Anderson. \"Through it we honor not only Our Lady of Guadalupe and express the unity of the Order, but we also reaffirm the Order's dedication to the sanctity of human life. It is to the Blessed Mother that we turn in prayer as we work to end the Culture of Death that grips our society. As we think in terms of 'One Life, One Rose,' it is most appropriate that we turn to Our Lady of Guadalupe who made known her will through Juan Diego and the miracle of the roses.\""
