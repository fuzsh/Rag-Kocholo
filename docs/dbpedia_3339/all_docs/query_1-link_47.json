        "text": "Fr. Stegman’s scholarship was focused on the New Testament, with a specialty in the letters of St. Paul. An author and editor, Fr. Stegman’s publications include Opening the Door of Faith: Encountering Jesus and His Call to Discipleship; Written for Our Instruction: Theological and Spiritual Riches in Romans; Texts Less Traveled: Exploring Hebrews, the Catholic Epistles, and Revelation; The Paulist Biblical Commentary; and Opportunity for No Little Instruction: Biblical Essays in Honor of Daniel J. Harrington, S.J. and Richard J. Clifford, S.J.\n\nLast April, the School of Theology and Ministry held an event celebrating Fr. Stegman’s leadership, research, teaching, and contributions to theological education. At the event, Chris Donovan M.T.S. ’06, Th.M. ’18, one of the hundreds of students he taught and mentored throughout his career, recalled what it was like to be taught by Fr. Stegman:\n\n“Through Tom’s meticulous scholarship and extraordinary ability as a teacher, he guided us through the most challenging texts, revealing cultural contexts [and] the use of literary devices and metaphors, that once understood and appreciated, opened the door to an encounter in freedom with the spirit of love and faithfulness in Scripture,” said Donovan. “Like a beautiful icon, Tom reflects the image and draws us into the Spirit of Christ.”\n\nFr. Stegman said he never aspired to be dean, and that he agreed with his late friend, colleague, and former teacher Daniel Harrington, S.J., that they had “the best job in the world” studying, teaching, and writing about sacred Scripture. Fr. Stegman however, said he grew to love the job much more than he anticipated, adding that he thought there was “nothing more important than being part of a school that trains Jesuits, those from other religious orders, and laypeople to do ministry work.”\n\nAfter Fr. Stegman was diagnosed with glioblastoma in 2019, he spoke openly about his illness, including at a 2021 Agape Latte appearance and in a 2022 Boston College Magazine podcast.\n\nIn the BCM podcast, when asked if he ever gets angry with God about his health, he offered the following: “Not for one second. I have lived a blessed life. I have received so many blessings through the Society of Jesus in terms of the education I have been given, the health care I have received through our benefactors. I have been able to travel as a Jesuit. I have so much to be grateful for. I can go back to many times where I can see God was leading me through circumstances, through people. If I had to go tomorrow, I would be able to look back at a very rich, full life. No, I’m not angry with God, because God has been so good to me.”\n\nHis grace and strong faith served as sources of inspiration and solace for many of his friends and colleagues.\n\n“I want to bear faithful witness to our hope in the Resurrection from the dead,” he said in his Agape Latte address. “I have found our faith so consoling to me. We believe that death is not the end, but the beginning. As a priest, as somebody who teaches New Testament, the Resurrection is the fundamental tenet and belief. I want to bear a faithful witness to it in my life, not just my words.”\n\nFr. Stegman was raised in Holdrege, Neb. A talented high school baseball player, he was inducted into the Phelps County (Nebraska) Sports Hall of Fame and later coached junior varsity baseball at Creighton Preparatory School in Omaha. He remained an ardent sports fan his entire life, and particularly enjoyed following the St. Louis Cardinals and Green Bay Packers.\n\nHe studied mathematics at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln, but he left after his first year to attend St. Charles Borromeo Seminary in Philadelphia, where he earned a bachelor’s degree in philosophy, summa cum laude. He joined the Jesuits in 1985. He graduated with a master’s degree in philosophy from Marquette University, and both an M.Div. and S.T.L. from Weston Jesuit School of Theology. He earned a doctorate in New Testament studies from Emory University, under the direction of renowned theologian Luke Timothy Johnson. He was ordained in 1995.\n\nA member of the USA Midwest Province of the Society of Jesus, Fr. Stegman represented his province at the 2012 Procurators Congregation in Nairobi and at the 36th General Congregation of the Society of Jesus in Rome, where he had the opportunity to meet Pope Francis.\n\nHe was also a member of the Catholic Biblical Association and Society of Biblical Literature, and held visiting chairs at Marquette and Creighton universities.\n\nFr. Stegman is survived by his parents, Dennis and Kay Stegman; his brother Mike and sister-in-law Karen Stegman; his brother Mark and sister-in-law Mary Jo Stegman; his sister Patti and brother-in-law Michael Hasty; seven nephews and a niece; and his brothers in the Society of Jesus.\n\nA Dean Thomas D. Stegman, S.J., Financial Aid Fund has been established to honor Fr. Stegman’s legacy."
